The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK-1, -2, and -3) are members of the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase family of enzymes. They are activated in response to certain cytokines, as well as by cellular stresses including chemotoxins, peroxides, and irradiation. They have been implicated in the pathology of a variety of different diseases with an inflammatory component including asthma, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this work, high-throughput screening identified a JNK inhibitor with an excellent kinase selectivity profile. Using X-ray crystallography and biochemical screening to guide our lead optimization, we prepared compounds with inhibitory potencies in the low-double-digit nanomolar range, activity in whole cells, and pharmacokinetics suitable for in vivo use. The new compounds were over 1000fold selective for JNK-1 and -2 over other MAP kinases including ERK2, p38R, and p38 and showed little inhibitory activity against a panel of 74 kinases.
Introduction c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK-1) is a member of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family of enzymes responsible for the serine/threonine phosphorylation of intracellular targets. JNK-1 and the other JNK enzymes JNK-2 and JNK-3 are activated in response to cellular stresses such as heat shock, irradiation, hypoxia, chemotoxins, and peroxides. They are also activated in response to various cytokines and participate in the onset of apoptosis.1,2 Upregulation of JNK activity is associated with a number of different disease states. JNK-1 phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 has been shown to down-regulate insulin signaling in vitro.3,4 Conversely, JNK-1 null mice maintain lower fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels compared to their wild-type litter mates when they are high-fat-fed, indicating that these animals are protected from the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance.5 These results imply a role for JNK-1 in type 2 diabetes mellitus.6 JNK-2 null mice have been produced by two different laboratories, and there is a clear role for JNK-2 in immunological function.7,8 JNK-2, often in concert with JNK-1, has been implicated in the pathology of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis9 and asthma.10-15 It also may play a role in cancer,16 as well as ischemia-reperfusion injury following myocardial infarction17 or stroke.1 Inhibitors of JNK-1 and JNK-2 could be useful for treating these diseases, as well as a broad range of other diseases with an inflammatory component. JNK-3 has been shown to mediate neuronal apoptosis and may therefore be involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibitors of JNK-3 could be useful for treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, stroke, and other diseases of the central nervous system.1,18 JNK-3 knockout

mouse studies lend further evidence to the role of JNK-3 in neurological disorders.19 Thus, inhibitors of JNK activity have the potential to provide benefits for patients with many different chronic diseases. Small molecules with good potency, selectivity against a broad panel of kinases, and pharmacokinetic profiles sufficient to achieve good exposure in vivo would be ideal for probing the role of JNK function in these diseases. The active sites of JNK-1, -2, and-3 are highly homologous, but each protein is the product of a different gene. At least 10 different JNK isoforms have been identified, and all of these are splice variants of JNK-1, -2, or -3. JNK-1 and -2 are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, while JNK-3 is restricted to the brain, heart, and testis. Some cellular proteins phosphorylated by JNK enzymes include the gene transcription factors c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, and Elk-1;2 the insulin receptor substrates IRS-113 and IRS-2; Shc; and Gab-1. JNK enzymes themselves must be phosphorylated to carry out their functions. The enzymes MKK-4 and MKK-7 are known to phosphorylate and activate JNK-1 and -2.1,2 Some of these biochemical events can serve as the basis for assaying JNK activity in vitro. There has been considerable effort to identify JNK inhibitors over the past several years, and several detailed reports have appeared20-26 (Figure 1). Still more examples have appeared in the patent literature.27,28 In this work, we report a series outside the scope of the previous work. The new compounds are potent JNK inhibitors that bind to the ATP site in an unusual manner. They also display remarkable selectivity vs several dozen other kinases, perhaps because of their special binding mode with JNK-1. These JNK inhibitors may be suitable for use in animal studies, providing a critical tool to elucidate the role of JNK in vivo. Chemistry Most of compounds in this study were prepared by appropriate substitution of diaminopyridine 1, available in one step from malononitrile and HBr(g)29 (Scheme 1). Addition-elimination with sodium ethoxide at the 2-bromo position gave ether 2.30

Similarly, sodium isopropoxide gave ether 3, while other alkoxides gave alkyl ethers 4, and n-butylthiol sodium salt gave thioether 5. Acylation of ether 2 with acid chlorides was regioselective, providing N-6 amides 6. Methylchloroformate

and triphosgene also reacted with diaminopyridine 2 at N-6, providing carbamate 7 and, upon treatment of the N-6 isocyanate with ethylamine, urea 8. Since diaminopyridine 2 is rather electron-deficient, N-6 did not participate in alkylation or reductive amination reactions. To prepare an N-6 alkyl derivative, we started with hydroxypyridine 9.31 A triflate ester was prepared using PhN(Tf)2, and then addition-elimination with (2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethylamine proceeded smoothly to provide phenethylaminopyridine 10. Most of the acid chlorides either were commercially available or prepared in one step from a readily available acid and either thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Acid chloride 11 required a lengthier sequence (Scheme 2). Starting from 2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanol32 (12), electrophilic bromination and then protection of the alcohol with TBSCl gave silyl ether 13. Halogenmetal exchange with n-butyllithium was followed by addition of dimethyl disulfide and then removal of the silyl protecting group with fluoride ion to provide thioether 14. Oxidation of the thioether to the sulfone was accomplished with hydrogen peroxide in trifluoroacetic acid, and then oxidation of the alcohol to the acid with Jones' reagent provided acid 15. Treatment with thionyl chloride gave acid chloride 11, which was used for subsequent acylations. We prepared amides 16 and 17 from bromopyridine 1 and acetyl chloride or (2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)acetyl chloride, respectively (Scheme 3). Attempts to prepare C-2 ethers from bromide 16 or 17 via alkoxide addition-elimination resulted in hydrolysis of the amide, so we elected to install the C-2 alkoxy groups first and then acylate the resulting ethers. By use of conditions similar to those employed for the acylation of bromopyridine 1, ethers 3 and 4 and thioether 5 were acylated with acid chlorides to provide acetamides 18 and 19, (2,5dimethoxyphenyl)acetamides 20, and amidothioether 21. Other C-2 substituents could be installed without hydrolysis of the N-6 amide, so bromides 16 and 17 were suitable starting materials for the preparation of analogues 22-26. Additionelimination of ethylamine or isopropylamine to bromide 16 gave triaminopyridine 22 or 23, respectively. Suzuki coupling of bromide 16 with phenylboronic acid gave biarylamide 24, while Negishi coupling with n-propylzinc iodide gave propylpyridine 25. Reduction of bromide 17 with zinc/HCl provided C-2 unsubstituted pyridine 26. Acylation of aminopyridine 2 with bromoacetyl bromide cleanly gave bromoamide 27 (Scheme 4). This intermediate allowed us to further explore the SAR about the N-6 amide, using nucleophilic substitution of the bromide to rapidly introduce further diversity to the series. The best results were found with amines, so bromide 27 was treated with different primary or secondary alkylamines to provide analogues 28. Cyclic amines also smoothly displaced bromide 27, providing

piperidine 29, morpholine 30, hydroxypiperidine 31, and carboxypiperidine 32. Carboxypiperidine 32 could be further elaborated by preparing amides from the carboxylic acid. Standard peptide coupling conditions were sufficient to produce amides 33 and 34. Exploration of the pyridine C-3 position required a different synthesis of the core (Scheme 5). To prepare 3-chloropyridine 35, we began by heating 4-amino-2,6-dichloropyridine (36) with sodium ethoxide to displace the C-2 chloride. Then a carboxylate was installed at C-6 via Pd-mediated carbonylation in methanol, providing methyl ester 37. Chlorination with N-chlorosuccinimide proceeded at C-3, and then the resulting intermediate was stirred with methanolic ammonia to give an amide. This was subjected to Hoffmann rearrangement conditions to provide diaminopyridine 38. Acylation with acid chloride 11 proceeded as for other aminopyridines, giving amide 35. Changes at C-4 and C-5 were accomplished via other methods (Scheme 6). To prepare 4-methylpyridine 39, we subjected chloropyridine 4033 to the same ethoxide addition-elimination

conditions as we did for bromopyridine 1 and then followed with N-6 acylation. Starting with pentanoylamide 6b, treatment with sulfuryl chloride gave 5-chloropyridine 41. The N-6 methylation was also straightforward starting from amide 6b, giving tertiary amide 42. To prepare isomeric pyridine 43, we started with 2,4,6-trichloropyridine (44)34 and sodium ethoxide. After isolation of the 4-ethoxypyridine, lithiation and carboxylation were followed by conversion to the corresponding nicotinamide 45 using standard conditions. Dehydration of the amide with POCl3 provided the nicotinonitrile, and then the C-2 and C-6 amino groups were simultaneously installed under autoclave conditions. Acylation completed the synthesis of amidopyridine 43. Results and Discussion In our work, the basis for the biochemical assay was JNK-1 mediated phosphorylation of ATF-2.35 High-throughput screening identified acetamide 6a, with IC50 ) 750 nM (Table 1). Competition experiments confirmed that this inhibitor binds competitively and reversibly to the ATP site. This compound demonstrated a remarkable selectivity profile, showing little cross-reactivity with any of 74 other non-c-Jun-N-terminal kinases. Additionally, it showed some inhibition of c-Jun

phosphorylation in hepG2 cells. The rapid synthesis of the core and the modular nature of analogue synthesis allowed us to quickly explore the SAR about the C-2 and C-6 positions. Exploration of the amide position revealed that groups larger than the original acetamide 6a could improve potency (6b). Branching at the R-position diminished activity (6c), but -branching was better tolerated (6d). Replacement of the amide
Table 1. SAR about Amide 6

R-carbon with oxygen or nitrogen completely abolished activity, as did removal of the amide carbonyl group (7-10). Phenylacetamide 6e was slightly more potent than acetamide 6a, but further exploration of the amide region was facilitated by the ready availability of a variety of substituted phenylacetic acids. Hydrophobic substituents gave some improvement in activity (6f-k), but the best gains were found with methoxy substituents. Methoxy regioisomers 6l, 6m, and 6n were all more active than unsubstituted phenylacetamide 6e. Further gains in potency could be found upon dimethoxy substitution of the phenyl ring, with 2,5-dimethoxy analogue 6o being the optimal arrangement. Disubstitution with other groups such as methyl (6p) or bromide (6q) did not match these gains in potency. Additional substituents in the 6o 4-phenyl position were tolerated. Acetamide 6r, sulfone 6s, and bromide 6t were roughly equipotent with 6o, while nitro compound 6u was slightly less potent than amide 6o. The optimal N-6 amide was the (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylsulfonylphenyl)acetamide 6s. A second set of N-6 amides was prepared from bromoamide 27 (Table 2). Since inhibitors could be prepared in one step from bromoamide 27, we were able to rapidly assemble and evaluate a set of 2-aminoacetamides. N,N-Disubstitution was preferred because tertiary amines 28a and 28b were more active than secondary amine 28c. Linear aliphatic amines were generally less potent than amide 6a, but we made some gains by displacing bromoamide 27 with more hydrophilic amines. Hydroxyethylamine 28d, piperidine 29, morpholine 30, and hydroxypiperidine 31 all were more potent than acetamide 6a. Further modification of the piperidine scaffold revealed additional gains. Piperidine 4-carboxylic amides were somewhat more potent than hydroxypiperidine 31, with examples 33 and 34 giving IC50 values below 100 nM. The most potent example from this set of aminoacetamides was n-butylamidopiperidine 33.

mode of binding for our inhibitors.36-38 An X-ray crystal structure of bromide 6t bound to JNK-1 reveals some of the critical binding interactions between the ligand and the enzyme (Figure 2). The inhibitor occupies the ATP binding site, with the pyridine ring placed deep within the adenosine binding region. The C-4 amine forms a weak hydrogen bond with Glu109, but the hydrogen-bonding interaction is not optimal because the C-4 amine and Glu109 do not lie in the same plane. The pyridine ring itself lies in a hydrophobic pocket defined by Ile86, Leu168, Val158, Val40, and Ile32. The nitrile protrudes further into this pocket and lies 4.0 Å from Lys55, forming a weak hydrogen bond with the side chain amine. The ethyl ether is oriented out of the adenosine binding region and toward the ribose binding region on the surface of the protein. There are no clear hydrogen-bonding interactions between the ether oxygen and the protein. The inhibitor amide carbonyl

oxygen lies 2.6 Å from the backbone amide NH group of Met111 but not in the same plane as the backbone amide. Thus, the inhibitor makes two out-of-plane hydrogen bonds with the hinge region (residues 109-111). The phenyl ring makes a hydrophobic interaction with Ile32, while the 4-bromo and 5-methoxy substituents are pointed toward the solvent. Additional residues on the protein surface offer the potential for hydrogen-bonding interactions with substituents in the 4- or 5-phenyl position. It is possible that hydrogen bond acceptors in the 4-phenyl position (e.g., 6r and 6s) take advantage of these interactions. Unfortunately we could not confirm this hypothesis because high-quality X-ray data could not be obtained with inhibitors bearing such 4-phenyl substituents. The X-ray data revealed that the ethyl ether was pointed toward the ribose binding region of JNK-1. The ribose binding site is rich in potential hydrogen-bonding interactions, and so

accessing this region was the focus of SAR efforts about the ether. Believing that more polar groups would provide stronger interactions with the hydrogen-bonding groups available in the ribose binding pocket, we added a variety of functional groups to the end of the ethyl chain (Table 3). 2-Hydroxyethyl and 2-methoxyethyl ethers 20a and 20b were both approximately as potent as ethyl ether 6o, but there was no gain in potency with these modifications. Other changes we explored at the ethyl 2-position included methyl sulfone 20c, amine 19a, and carboxylic acid 19b. In each case, installation of these groups diminished activity. Variation in the spacing between the ether oxygen atom and the distal functional group also failed to improve potency. In the hope of mimicking the ribose furan skeleton, we prepared tetrahydrofuryl analogue 19c, but this too was less potent than ethyl ether 6a. Despite these attempts, efforts to access the nearby ribose binding pocket did not result in significant gains in potency. An ether linkage was optimal at C-2 because bromide 17, thioether 21, amine (22 and 23), aryl 24, alkyl 25, or hydrogen 26 substitution gave compounds with diminished activity. Variation of the alkyl ether chain length showed that neither a longer alkyl ether (19d) nor a methyl ether (19e) provided additional potency. However, a branched ether did provide a boost in potency. Isopropyl ether 18a showed about a 2-fold improvement over the corresponding ethyl ether 6a. The optimal group at the C-2 position was the isopropyl ether. When this was combined with the optimal C-6 amide, the resulting compound 18b showed IC50 ) 14 nM. Changes elsewhere about the diaminopyridine core generally were not tolerated (Table 4). As expected from the X-ray structure, replacement of the 4-amino group with a methyl substituent resulted in a loss of activity (39). Simultaneous deletion of the C-3 nitrile and the C-4 amino groups (46)39 likewise abolished JNK inhibition. The pyridine nitrogen atom of 6u did not appear to be interacting with the protein surface, so we prepared 2,6-diaminopyridine 43 in the hope of gaining another H-bond with the hinge region. Unfortunately, 43 was devoid of activity. Chlorination of the unsubstituted C-5 position also was not tolerated (41). N-Methylation of the N-6 amide abolished activity as well (42). One change that was successful involved replacement of the C-3 nitrile with a chloride. Chloropyridine 35 showed an IC50 value of 36 ( 14 nM,

comparable to cyanopyridine 6s. Lead amide 6a therefore contains the optimal ring pattern substitution with a C-2 ether, a C-3 nitrile, a C-4 amine, and a C-6 amide. Compounds with IC50 < 200 nM vs JNK-1 were screened for their ability to inhibit c-Jun phosphorylation in HepG2 cells (Tables 1-4). Because c-Jun is a known substrate for JNK-1, this assay provides a direct measurement of JNK-1 inhibition in whole cells. In general, compounds showed EC50 values about 15-fold less potent than their IC50 values. There was no correlation between inhibitor membrane permeability (data not shown) and the EC50 to IC50 ratio. This indicates that cell penetration alone does not explain the drop in cellular potency relative to the ATF-2 phosphorylation assay. The intracellular concentration of ATP (10 mM) is greater than that used in the in vitro assays (5 µM), and this may account for most of the discrepancy between the two assay formats. Most of the phenylacetamides tested showed cellular activity, with the relative potencies in the enzymatic assay translating to a similar rank order in whole cells. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of this series is its exquisite kinase selectivity profile. Previously, investigators at Serono published JNK inhibitors with some kinase selectivity, and these represent the most selective JNK inhibitors in the literature.22,25 We screened several compounds against a panel of 74 different kinases and found that cross-reactivity was minimal, with the exception of JNK-2 and JNK-3 (Table 5). Ki values for JNK-1 were in the single-digit nanomolar range for the most potent compounds, but these showed measurable activity against only a few other members of the panel. Where cross-reactivity could be found, the compounds were well over 100-fold selective. A possible explanation for this selectivity profile can be discerned from the crystal structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Most kinase inhibitors form strong and clearly defined hydrogen bonds to the hinge region.40-42 Our compounds form two suboptimal hydrogen bonds with the JNK-1 hinge region, deriving much of their potency from other interactions within the ATP binding site (Figure 2). The weak hydrogen-bonding interaction with the hinge region could limit the ability of our JNK inhibitors to bind to other kinases.43 Although the kinases we screened represent only about 15% of the human kinome, this level of selectivity is uncommon among

kinase inhibitors. Such selectivity offers an important advantage for probing the role of JNK inhibition in vivo. Pharmacokinetic profiles were determined for JNK inhibitors 6o, 6s, 18b, and 35 in Sprague-Dawley rats (Table 6). Inhibitor 6o showed a short half-life of roughly 1 h, with rapid clearance and barely measurable bioavailability. Microsomal incubation studies revealed that oxidative metabolism was very rapid with this compound, indicating that the pharmacokinetic profile could be improved if oxidative metabolism could be suppressed. Attempts to improve the microsomal stability of these phenylacetamides revealed that substitution of the phenylacetamide with a methylsulfonyl group greatly lowered the rate of oxidative metabolism. Inhibitor 6s, which bears a 4-methylsulfonyl group on the 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl ring, showed a somewhat better half-life than 6o and markedly better bioavailability. Although it is not clear whether this is due to improved first-pass metabolism or better absorption, the presence of the methylsulfone group clearly is beneficial to the pharmacokinetic profile of the JNK inhibitors. The most potent JNK-1 inhibitor, compound 18b, was less orally bioavailable than 6s, and it was also cleared more rapidly than ethyl ethers 6o and 6s. This is evidence that the isopropyl ether is more metabolically labile than the corresponding ethyl ether. 3-Chloropyridine analogue 35 showed the best oral bioavailability (F ) 49%), half-life (2.1 h), and drug exposure level (AUC ) 1.47 µg,h/mL) of the four compounds we evaluated. The oral bioavailability and reasonable drug exposures demonstrated with 6s and 35 make them candidates for further in vivo testing in JNK-related disease models. Conclusion We have identified several potent JNK inhibitors with excellent kinase selectivity profiles. X-ray crystallographic data

indicate that the hydrogen-bonding network of these kinase ATP-site ligands is different from many other kinase inhibitors, and the unusual binding mode may be responsible for their kinase selectivity. We have prepared compounds 6s and 35 with cellular activity and oral bioavailability. These selective JNK inhibitors can serve as important probes to discern what role JNK plays in a host of diseases. Evaluation of the new compounds in a variety of disease models will give us a better understanding of what the physiological implications of JNK inhibition are, and we are eager to make these inhibitors available for such studies. Our own in vivo results with JNK inhibitors in inflammation and diabetes models will be disclosed at a later date. Experimental Section
General. Thin-layer chromatography systems were the same as those used for column chromatography, with Rf  0.3. Column chromatography was performed under 5 psi of N2 using 230-400 mesh silica gel or with an Analogix Intelli Flash 280 MPLC system using prepacked, disposable silica gel columns. Analytical HPLC traces and compounds purified by HPLC were obtained by elution through a C18 reverse-phase column with a gradient of 5 mM aqueous ammonium acetate/acetonitrile or 0.1% aqueous TFA/ acetonitrile as eluants. Concentration gradients started at 0% acetonitrile and 100% aqueous TFA or at 5% acetonitrile and 95% aqueous medium. Microwave heating was performed using a Personal Chemistry Emrys Optimizer microwave apparatus, and reaction pressures were not allowed to exceed 20 atm. 1H NMR data are tabulated in the following order: multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; b, broad), number of protons, coupling constants in Hz. 4,6-Diamino-2-ethoxynicotinonitrile (2).30 To a 5 mL sealable heavy-walled glass tube suitable for microwave heating containing 5 mL of absolute ethanol was added 150 mg (6.5 mmol) of sodium

ATF-2 Phosphorylation Assay. JNK-1, JNK-2, and JNK-3 were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (formerly Upstate Biotechnology).47 Kinase reactions were performed in a 50 µL volume containing 10 ng/well JNK-1 (4.4 nM), 10 ng/well JNK-2 (4.1 nM), or 10 ng/well (3.8 nM) JNK-3, 1 µM BT-GST-ATF-2 substrate, and - [33P]-ATP (5 µM, 400 µCi/µmol) in a buffer containing 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM dTT in a 96-well polypropylene plate. Reactions were carried out at 15-20 °C and stopped after 60 min with the addition of EDTA, giving a final concentration of 50 mM. The 30 µL aliquots of the quenched reactions were transferred to a Streptavidin FlashPlate containing 170 µL of PBS. The plate was incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min. The plate was then washed 4 times with PBS. The plate was then counted in a Perkin-Elmer Micro-Beta plate counter, 1 min per well. Kinase Selectivity Assays. Recombinant protein kinases were either commercially obtained or expressed using the FastBac bacculovirus expression system (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and purified using either nickel (his-tag) or glutathione (GST) affinity chromatography. Kinase assays were conducted in 24 µL volumes on 384-well microplates using TECAN liquid-handling automation. Ser/Thr-kinase assays were performed using a radioactive FlashPlate-based assay platform.48 In this format, biotinylated substrate peptide (2 µM), -[33P]-ATP (5 µM, 2 mCi/µmol), inhibitors (3-10000 nM in 2% DMSO), and enzyme were incubated for 1 h in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 µM Na3VO4, and 0.075 mg/mL Triton X-100, stopped with 80 µL of stop buffer containing 100 mM EDTA and 4 M NaCl, transferred to streptavidin-coated 384well FlashPlates (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA), which were then washed 3 times and read using a TopCount microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer). Tyr kinase reactions were performed using a time-

resolved fluorescence (HTRF) platform. In this format, biotinylated substrate peptide (0.5 µM), ATP (10 µM to 1 mM), inhibitors (310000 nM in 2% DMSO), and enzyme were incubated for 1 h in buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 100 µM Na3VO4, and 0.01% BSA. Reactions were stopped with 50 µL of revelation buffer containing (final concentrations of) Eu-conjugated anti-pY-PT66 antibody (0.05 µg/ mL) (CisBio), PycolLink Streptaviding-APC (0.001 µg/mL) (Prozyme), and 60 mM EDTA in a buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mM KF, 0.005% Tween-20, and 0.05% BSA. Following 60 min of incubation with revelation buffer, the reactions were read using an Envision fluorescence microplate reader (PerkinElmer) with 615 nm excitation and 665 nm emission. IC50 values were determined from six compound titration curves, and corresponding Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation Ki ) IC50/(1 + ([ATP]/Km)).49 Cellular Assay (c-Jun Phosphorylation). HepG2 human hepatoma cells (ATCC) were cultured in low glucose MEM supplemented with 1× NEAA, 1× sodium pyruvate, and 10% FBS (all from Invitrogen, "complete media"). For P-c-Jun assays, cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 500 µL of complete media on 24-well collagen-coated plates and incubated overnight. Serial compound dilutions were made in DMSO at 100×, and then 5 µL was added directly to the media on the cells to provide the final inhibitor concentrations (final DMSO concentration in media was 1%). After 1 h, cells were stimulated with vehicle control or TNFR for 30 min and harvested in 70 µL of lysis buffer (TBS (54 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, Sigma), 1% TritonX-100 (Sigma), 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA (Sigma), 0.5 mM sodium fluoride (Sigma), 1 mM pervanadate (Sigma), 1 µM microcystin (Calbiochem), 1 mM AEBSF (Roche), 1 tablet of complete EDTA FreeMini inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) and frozen at -80 °C prior to use in the P-c-Jun assay. P-c-Jun ELISAs were performed as described by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling Technology) using 50 µL of cell extract. X-ray Crystallography. Purified JNK-1-R1 isoform50 with a C-His-tag extension was incubated with a 5× molar excess of the JIP-1 peptide.36 The crystallization experiments were in the hanging drop vapor diffusion format at 4 °C. Hanging drops consisted of 2 µL of the protein/peptide solution plus 2 µL of well solution over 1 mL of reservoir. The reservoir contained 3 M (NH4)SO4 (2.83.1 M range) and 10-14% glycerol at a pH between 5.8 and 7.0. Cocrystallization with compound 6t was achieved by dissolving DMSO stock solutions of 6t (100 or 50 mM) into the protein/peptide solution in a 3-fold molar excess. The protein/JIP-1/compound 6t complex was allowed to incubate for at least an hour on ice and was later set up to crystallize. Crystals grew in 4-7 days. Large crystals of the complex had the morphology of hexagonal bipyramids. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a model of residues 63-373 of the PDB entry 1jnk, corresponding to the structure of JNK-3. Data were collected at the IMCA-CAT facility using a Quantum210 detector and consisted of 100 1° frames with an exposure per frame of 5 s. Data were collected with the standard station software, processed with HKL2000, and the structure solution and refinement were done using CNX and QUANTA. The coordinates for the structure of the refined JNK-1/JIP-1/compound 6t complex have been deposited with the RCSB collaborative (PDB) with entry code 2GMX.
