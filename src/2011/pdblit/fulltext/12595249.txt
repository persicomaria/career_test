Prokaryotic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases are characterized by a distinct quaternary structure, as compared to that of the homologous eukaryotic enzymes. Here we report a newly determined crystal structure of the dimeric Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase from Photobacterium leiognathi (crysÊ tallized in space group R32, re®ned at 2.5 A resolution, R-factor 0.19) and analyse it in comparison with that of the monomeric enzyme from Escherichia coli. The dimeric assembly, observed also in a previously studied monoclinic crystal form of P. leiognathi Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, is based on a ring-shaped subunit contact region, de®ning a solvated interface cavity. Three clusters of neighbouring residues play a direct role in the stabilization of the quaternary assembly. The present analysis, extended to the amino acid sequences of the other 11 known prokaryotic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases, shows that at least in ®ve other prokaryotic enzymes the interface residue clusters are under strong evolutionary constraint, suggesting the attainment of a quaternary structure coincident with that of P. leiognathi Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase. Calculation of electrostatic ®elds for both the enzymes from E. coli and P. leiognathi shows that the monomeric/dimeric association behaviour displayed by prokaryotic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases is related to the distribution of surface charged residues. Moreover, Brownian dynamics simulations reproduce closely the observed enzyme:substrate association rates, highlighting the role of the active site neighbouring residues in determining the dismutase catalytic properties.

Introduction
Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases (Cu,Zn SODs) are a class of highly conserved homodimeric metalloenzymes which catalyse the dismutation of superoxide anion into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, representing the ®rst cellular defence line

against oxygen byproducts toxicity (Ames, 1983; Hassan, 1984; Fraga et al., 1990; Bordo et al., 1994). All eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs characterized up to now are composed of two identical subunits structurally organized in an eight-stranded antiparallel b-barrel with Greek key topology, each carrying a Cu2, Zn2 ion pair. It is common belief that this enzyme family evolved as a consequence of oxygenation of earth atmosphere, about two billion years ago (Steffens et al., 1983; Lee et al., 1985; Fridovich, 1986). Eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs are known to be remarkably stable to thermal inactivation and to proteolytic cleavage (Bannister et al., 1987). The

284 enzymes from ®ve different eukaryotic species, ox (Tainer et al., 1982; Rypniewski et al., 1995), yeast (Djinovic et al., 1992; Ogihara et al., 1996), spinach (Kitagawa et al., 1991), man (Parge et al., 1992), and Xenopus laevis (Djinovic-Carugo et al., 1996) have been thoroughly characterized by crystallographic analysis, either in the oxidized or in the reduced form, showing that not only the molecular fold, but also the subunit association interface, are highly conserved through the eukaryotic phyla. Moreover, comparison of the known Cu,Zn SOD amino acid sequences carried out through multiple alignments (Getzoff et al., 1989; Pascarella & Argos, 1992; Bordo et al., 1994), and based on molecular modeling (Falconi et al., 1991; Polticelli et al., 1994), shows that within the Cu,Zn SOD fold insertions and deletions occur predominantly in the polypeptide loops connecting b-strands, without altering the b-barrel integrity. Cu,Zn SOD enzymes have been identi®ed also in prokaryota. The ®rst bacterial Cu,Zn SOD was identi®ed in the pony®sh symbiont Photobacterium leiognathi (PSOD, Puget & Michelson, 1974). Identi®cation of a Cu,Zn SOD in Caulobacter crescentus (Steinman, 1982) and comparative sequence analysis have shown that, instead of being the result of orizontal gene transfer from the host ®sh, as ®rstly suggested (Martin & Fridovich, 1981), the enzyme was embodied in the bacterial genome since the prokaryota/eukaryota differentiation (Leunissen & de Jong, 1986). Cu,Zn SODs have subsequently been shown to be common in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria (Kroll et al., 1995) and, to date, the complete sequences of 13 Cu,Zn SODs from distinct bacterial species have been identi®ed. Amino acid sequence alignments suggest a conservation of the known Cu,Zn SOD three-dimensional fold for the bacterial enzymes. Moreover, despite the wide amino acid sequence variability at expected surface locations, the bacterial Cu,Zn SODs have also been shown to be mostly dimeric (Puget & Michelson, 1974; Steinman & Ely, 1990). This has been con®rmed by the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of PSOD (Bourne et al., 1996), which has, however, shown that the b-barrel elements recruited to form the dimer interface are different from those of the homologous eukaryotic enzymes. Nevertheless, exceptions to such quaternary structure association are represented by the enzymes from Escherichia coli (ESOD) and from Brucella abortus, which have been isolated as active and stable monomeric species (Battistoni & Rotilio, 1995; Chen et al., 1995; Battistoni et al., 1998). Here we report the X-ray structure of the P. leiognathi Cu,Zn SOD crystallized in space group R32, in a highly symmetric homodimeric assembly. The crystal structure of this enzyme is compared with that of PSOD, crystallized in the monoclinic C2 space group (Bourne et al., 1996). The availability of the X-ray crystal structure of the monomeric Ê ESOD, recently solved at 2.0 A resolution (Pesce et al., 1997), allowed us to gain insight on the struc-

tural features which determine either the monomeric or the dimeric state in the known prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs. Understanding how an active and stable monomeric Cu,Zn SOD can be obtained is a challenging task, as the production of monomeric SODs by protein engineering (Banci et al., 1995; Lin et al., 1995), or by SDS treatment (Rigo et al., 1978), has previously resulted in enzymes with low activity and reduced heat stability. The analysis presented here shows that distinct clusters of residues are responsible for PSOD dimer formation and that the monomeric state of ESOD may be ascribed to radical mutations affecting these clusters.

Results
The crystal structure of PSOD in space group R32 Ê The 2.5 A re®ned model of PSOD (R-factor  0.191, R-free  0.260), contains 151 amino acids and 54 solvent molecules per asymmetric unit. The molecule displays close to ideal stereochemistry (see Table 1), as evaluated by the program PROCHECK (Lawskowski et al., 1993). The subunit fold of dimeric PSOD (the dimer is centred on a crystallographic 2-fold axis) conforms to the conventional eight-stranded Greek key b-barrel observed in eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs, as anticipated by the recent crystallographic investigation on the same bacterial enzyme, studied in the monoclinic space group C2 (Bourne et al., 1996). A structural comparison of PSOD (from the R32 crystal form) and the eukaryotic Xenopus laevis Cu,Zn SOD (XSOD, subunit A) Ca backbone structures is shown in Figure 1; the rmsd between the two backbones, calÊ culated over 129 Ca pairs, is 1.75 A. Large deviations from the common three-dimensional fold Ê (3 ±11 A) are localized at Met8-Lys13 (1,2 loop; bovine Cu,Zn SOD conventional amino acid numbering is adopted throughout), Asn23-Thr25 (2,3 loop), Ala52-Glu55 (S-S subloop), Trp73-Asn77 (Zn subloop) and Asp130-Ala134 (electrostatic loop). These structural deviations are related to amino acid insertions or deletions in the loop regions connecting the b-strand segments. Compared to XSOD, PSOD displays a two-residue insertion between strand 1a and 2b, a very long insertion (eight residues fully solvent exposed) in the S-S subloop, and deletions in the loop joining b-strands 2b and 3c (one residue), in the Greek key loop (three residues), in the electrostatic loop (four residues) and at the C-terminal end (three residues; see Figure 2).

in the 1,2 loop, 3,6 loop, S-S subloop, electrostatic loop and the N-terminal segment of the 8 h strand, can be easily recognized as a pseudo 3-fold axis in the monoclinic crystal form, as indicated by similar, but not identical, intermolecular contacts. In both crystal forms, most of the packing interactions occur within a protein layer perpendicular to the pseudo 3-fold axis, which contains the PSOD dimers. Besides those mentioned above, additional intermolecular contacts within such protein layers involve the 64 ± 66 and 108± 113 regions, with localized minor differences in the two crystal forms. Stacking of the densely packed PSOD layers occurs along the (pseudo)3-fold axis direction, achieving a looser molecular packing (between protein layers) which is based on contacting residues different in the C2 and in the R32 crystal forms. In the latter case the layer-to-layer intermolecular contacts are achieved by loops 13 ±17, 32± 35, 67 ±77 and 124± 132. Local structural deviations in the Ca backbone of PSOD crystallized in R32 and C2 space groups can be ascribed to crystal contacts. In particular, a Ê rmsd of 0.44 A is found when the individual subunits in the two crystal forms are compared (151 Ca pairs). The PSOD dimer While in the eukaryotic Cu,Zn SOD dimer, represented in Figure 1c, the subunit interface is formed by 19 residues located in b-strands 1a and 2b, S-S subloop, Greek key loop and the C-terminal

regions, in the PSOD dimer, shown in Figure 1b, the interface is built by b-strands 4f, 5e and by part of loops 2,3 and 7,8, involving 18 residues on each subunit (see Figure 2). In the latter case the interÊ face region covers a surface of 754 A2 on each subunit, and has roughly the shape of a ¯at disk Ê having a diameter of 26 A. The interface residues are arranged to form a closed ring which surrounds a central solvated cavity with approximate Ê Ê Ê dimensions of 13 A by 10 A by 5 A, which is shown in Figure 3a. Since in the rhombohedral crystal form the interface is crossed by a crystallographic 2-fold axis, each residue involved in intermolecular interactions is observed twice, once on each subunit, and the cavity itself displays an exact 2-fold symmetry. The cohesion of the two PSOD subunits is mostly promoted by van der Waals Ê interactions, which involve 577 A2 of the total contact area, and by two intersubunit hydrogen bonds. In order to analyse the interchain interactions, summarized in Table 2, it is convenient to consider clusters of interacting interface residues. This approach proves particularly useful for analysing the capability of other prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD enzymes to form similar dimeric assemblies. In PSOD, three clusters of interface residues appear to be crucial for the formation of the dimer. The ®rst cluster is centred on the side-chain of Trp73, which, together with the side-chain of Phe71, forms a wide hydrophobic contact region, of Ê 158 A2, involving several residues from the facing

The second cluster is built by the side-chains of Met40 and Phe86. The two residues are in proximity of the 2-fold axis and form hydrophobic contacts with their symmetryrelated mates, Met40H and Phe86H . The third cluster, formed by Lys24, Tyr25 and Asp75', is characterized (see Table 2) by a double intermolecular hydrogen bond involving the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr25 and the terminal amino group of Lys24, and both carboxylate oxygen atoms (OE1 and OE2) of Asp75H . The latter hydrogen bond is further strengthened by coulombic interaction. Additional contribution to the interface stability is provided by the aliphatic portions of Pro100 and

Arg101, in hydrophobic interaction with the sidechains of Tyr25H and Leu98H , and by residues Ala84, Asp122 and His124, which, however, are only marginally involved in the intersubunit contacts, since only a minor fraction of their surface is in interaction with the other subunit (see Table 2). The intersubunit cavity (see Figure 3a) is located at the centre of the contact interface and has a Ê volume of about 280 A3; 16 residues, for a total of 63 atoms are lining its internal surface on each subunit. Four water molecules buried within the cavity are clearly visible in the electron density map of rhombohedral PSOD, together with their symmetry-related copies. They establish a hydrogen bonding network which extends to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ala84 and Leu98, as

On the top line, the amino acid numbering scheme of bovine SOD is assumed as reference. The alignment of PSOD, ESOD, and XSOD sequences has been deduced from the optimally superimposed structures (see Methods); the secondary structure is shown below each amino acid sequence using the following symbols: b-strands: Ê 2 3, a-helix: H, 310 helix: G. Superimposed residues having Ca atoms at a distance greater that 2.0 A have been represented in lower case letters. PSOD and XSOD interface residues are shown in green. The residues co-ordinating Cu2 and Zn2 are shown in red. Conserved amino acid positions are shown in upper case at the bottom of the alignment; alignment positions showing moderate variability (two amino acid types) are also displayed, in lower case. The sequences of Cu,Zn SODs from F. tularensis, C. crescentus and M. tuberculosis bear insertions which have not been included in the alignment. Their location is between the pair of underlined residues.

well as to the ND2, OD2, and NE2 atoms of Asn95, Asp122, and His124, respectively. The cavity appears almost fully hydrated by the trapped water molecules (see Figure 3a), except for the region next to the hydrophobic residues Val97 and Pro83, where no clear electron density accounting for ordered solvent could be observed. Prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs are either monomeric or dimeric The amino acid sequence of ESOD shares 49% identical residues with PSOD. As expected for pro-

teins showing such a level of primary structure identity, their three-dimensional structures are very similar, as shown in Figure 1a. In fact, the Ê rmsd calculated over 146 Ca atom pairs is 0.56 A. Nevertheless, the two protein structures display clear structural differences in four regions, which may be related to their distinct properties. The ®rst structural deviation is observed in the loop connecting b-strands 1a and 2b, as a consequence of a three amino acid deletion in the PSOD sequence (see Figure 2). The Greek key loop, between b-strands 4f and 7g, also displays different conformations in the two proteins, due to a single amino

289 sequences (P. leiognathi, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus in¯uenzae, Haemophilus parain¯uenzae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, H. ducreyi) the interface residues are under a more stringent evolutionary constraint than those of the full molecule, since they display a reduced amino acid variability compared to that of the whole bacterial SOD sequence. In agreement with the evolutionary tree analysis, the six bacterial Cu,Zn SODs mentioned above conserve the intermolecular environment around the unmutated Trp73, as well as the capability of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and salt links between Asp75 and both Lys24H and Tyr25H (see Figure 2), indicating that they can form dimers having a quaternary assembly similar to that observed in PSOD. On the other hand, the two known monomeric enzymes (Escherichia coli and Brucella abortus Cu,Zn SODs) are devoid of the bulky hydrophobic Trp73 and Phe86 residues, replaced by Gly and Val, respectively, and cannot form intersubunit hydrogen bonds between Asp75, Lys24H and Tyr25H , since these residues are substituted by Ala, Asp, Lys and by Asp, Pro, Gly, in E. coli and B. abortus enzymes, respectively. The amino acid sequences of Cu,Zn SOD from Salmonella typhimurium and L. pneumophila share some similarity with both the PSOD and the ESOD amino acid sequences, such that their aggregation state in solution is dif®cult to predict. The dendrograms of Figure 4a and b, however, show that the putative interface residues of the two enzymes have reduced variability with respect to each other if compared to the substitution level of the whole sequences, suggesting the presence of a tighter evolutionary constraint on these amino acid positions. Gel ®ltration chromatography (data not shown) of puri®ed S. typhimurium Cu,Zn SOD shows that the protein elutes as a dimer, indicating that replacement of the interface residues Trp73 and Phe71 with Tyr and Gly, respectively, expected to create a large interface cavity in the assembled dimer, either is not suf®cient to disrupt the quaternary structure or, less likely, may result in yet a different dimeric assembly. Indeed, it must be noted that the intersubunit hydrogen bonds formed in PSOD between Lys24, Tyr25 and Asp75H , can still be achieved in S. typhimurium Cu,Zn SOD bearing amino acids Thr24, Tyr25 and Asp75H (Table 2). The Cu,Zn SOD from Caulobacter crescentus is also known to be dimeric (Steinman, 1982). In this enzyme the residue cluster around position 73 displays a remarkable sequence rearrangement, substituting Trp73 with Asn (see Figure 2). On the other hand, the residue cluster which in PSOD is built by Met40 and Phe86, hosts Trp and Phe in C. crescentus Cu,Zn SOD. These residue replacements may allow increased intersubunit interaction, compensating for the decreased contribution provided by the cluster around residue 73.

acid insertion in ESOD. A single amino acid deletion in ESOD at position 76 (see Figure 2), which is part of the Zn subloop, may affect the enzyme behaviour towards dimerization, as discussed below. Finally, the two structures have a distinct conformation on the S-S subloop, where the Ca atom pairs of superimposed structures deviate up Ê to 4 A. This feature, however, may result from a crystal packing contact occurring in this solvent exposed loop of ESOD. In order to investigate the molecular basis of the different association properties in prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs, a model of a virtual ESOD dimer has been built, based on structure superposition with the PSOD dimer, and analysed with respect to the interface residues capability to (de)stabilize subunit association. Such a model shows that the bulky hydrophobic side-chains of Phe71 and Trp73, which in PSOD build a main apolar van der Waals contact area, are replaced in ESOD by Gly71 and by Glu73, respectively, as shown in Figure 3b. The side-chain volume contraction of the former residue, not compensated by a corresponding size increment of the facing amino acids, and the polar character of the latter residue, perturb substantially the intersubunit (expected hydrophobic) interaction in the virtual ESOD dimer. A further destabilizing effect results from the presence of residue Glu28, which in ESOD replaces PSOD Val28. In the virtual ESOD dimer, Glu28 faces Glu73H (see Figure 3b). Moreover, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the salt bridge observed in the PSOD subunit interface cannot be achieved in ESOD, where Asp75 is substituted by Ala (see Figure 2). Also, the mutations affecting the hydrophobic cluster Met40, Phe86, replaced in ESOD by Glu40, Val86, further destabilize the virtual ESOD dimer, due to the electrostatic repulsion between Glu40 and Glu40H , which are located in close proximity of the 2-fold axis. The mutual sequence similarities arising from the multiple Cu,Zn SOD whole sequence alignment of Figure 2 have been converted into the prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD evolutionary tree shown in Figure 4a. Limiting the amino acid sequence alignment to the sites occupied in PSOD molecules by interface residues, a second evolutionary tree, shown in Figure 4b, has been calculated. In each dendrogram the length of the tree branch path joining any two proteins is proportional to the percentage of mutated residues in their respective amino acid sequences. Due to ambiguities in determining the exact evolutionary pathway originating from the common unknown ancestral prokaryotic enzyme and leading to the observed Cu,Zn SOD sequences, the location of the branching points originating the various subtrees may be imprecise. The trees, however, correctly represent clusters of closely related sequences. Interestingly, the comparison between the tree calculated from the full Cu,Zn SOD sequences and that deduced from the interface residues clearly shows that in six prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD

291 ESOD and for two virtual monomeric PSOD molecules, all drawn in the same orientation of the dimeric PSOD, are shown in Figure 5, displaying a model section through the copper active site. In the case of the dimeric PSOD, most of the protein surface is surrounded by equipotential lines having negative values, except for the regions neighbouring the active sites, which are contoured by positive equipotential lines. A similar electrostatic ®eld distribution is observed for all the eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs (Desideri et al., 1992). Figure 5d shows that also ESOD is largely surrounded by negative equipotential lines, which extend toward the solvent and are replaced by positive lines only in proximity of the active site. The virtual monomeric PSOD molecules are surrounded by two negative and two positive potential regions (Figure 5b and c). The positive regions fall next to the copper site, where the equipotential lines extend toward the solvent, and at the subunit association interface, where the equipotential lines are close to the protein surface. The main difference in the equipotential line distributions characterizing monomeric ESOD with respect to the virtual monomeric PSOD molecules is thus localized at the subunit interface region: in PSOD such a region displays contracted positive equipotential lines, whilst in the truly monomeric ESOD such a region shows a pattern of negative equipotential lines extending into the solvent. In order to verify whether in prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs a different electrostatic ®eld distribution can sustain an enzyme-substrate association rate comparable to that observed in the dimeric eukaryotic enzymes, Brownian dynamics simulations (Allison & McCammon, 1985; Sharp et al., 1987; Sergi et al., 1994) have been carried out on the monomeric ESOD, on the dimeric PSOD and XSOD, and on the virtual monomeric PSOD and XSOD. The simulation yields similar enzyme:substrate association rates for the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes. In particular, the dimeric PSOD is predicted to display an activity higher (by a factor of two) than that of the dimeric XSOD, a result in agreement with the respective catalytic rates measured experimentally, which may be related to the increased solvent accessibility of the copper active site in PSOD (Polticelli et al., 1996; Stroppolo et al., 1998; Folcarelli et al., 1998). It must be noted, however, that the monomeric ESOD and the virtual monomeric PSOD display almost identical simulated enzyme:substrate association rates (very close to those of dimeric or virtual monomeric XSOD), despite the different equipotential line distributions in the molecular regions opposite to the active site (see Figure 5).

structure the former may adopt. In this respect it is worth pointing out that in M. tuberculosis Cu,Zn SOD the substitution of the two active site ligand residues His61 and His78 with Gln and Ala, respectively, may require some additional structural rearrangements in order to preserve the dismutase activity.

Discussion
The comparison of the two known three-dimensional structures of prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs, PSOD and ESOD, allowed us to assign a role to

292 the residues responsible for the quaternary structure assembly observed in PSOD. This analysis could be extended to the other 11 known prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs with the aim of establishing their respective dimerization capabilities. The structural analysis shows that three clusters of interface residues play a crucial role in the subunit:subunit recognition in PSOD. Among these, the cluster centred around Trp73 and Phe71 builds the most extended hydrophobic contact region Ê (158 A2) and plays a main role in maintenance of the dimeric state. Analysis of the prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD amino acid sequences con®rms the role of such a hydrophobic cluster, which is almost fully conserved in six of the enzymes considered. On the other hand, the three interface clusters have undergone almost complete amino acid replacement in the monomeric enzymes from E. coli and B. abortus. A unique ®nding regarding prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD subunit association is the presence of a large Ê intermolecular cavity (280 A3 volume) located at the centre of the subunit interface. Such a cavity could in principle decrease the subunit af®nity; however, the presence of trapped water molecules which ef®ciently establish hydrogen bond bridges between the facing subunits suggests a contribution of the solvent in stabilizing subunit association. This hypothesis is corroborated by the conservation of the polar residues lining the internal cavity observed among the ®ve dimeric enzymes more closely related to PSOD (see Table 2 and Figure 2). A main role in de®ning the monomeric or the dimeric state of bacterial Cu,Zn SODs is played by surface charged residues, which determine a different distribution of the electrostatic ®eld equipotential lines, particularly around the putative subunit association interface region. In the monomeric ESOD, such distribution displays an extended set of mainly negative equipotential lines protruding into the solvent (Figure 5d), which allow the enzyme to be soluble in the monomeric state and, due to long-range electrostatic repulsion, do not favour dimer association. A similar behaviour is expected for B. abortus Cu,Zn SOD, which is reported to be monomeric, and displays a Glu residue at position 73. The lack of any electrostatic potential extension into the solvent, for the interface region of the virtual monomeric PSOD, does not promote interaction with the solvent. Thus, in the absence of long-range electrostatic repulsion, once the two PSOD subunits get close enough, dimerization occurs, partly driven by the enthalpic contribution resulting from the contact between the complementary molecular interfaces. In agreement with these arguments, inspection of the amino acid sequences of the dimeric Cu,Zn SOD from S. typhimurium and L. pneumoniae indicates the presence of uncharged residues at the putative subunit association interfaces, suggesting for these enzymes a dimeric assembly similar to that

Prokaryotic SOD Dimer

of PSOD. On the other hand, the sequence of Cu,Zn SODs from F. tularensis, and M. tuberculosis undergo amino acid substitutions which do not allow us to predict the occurrence of a monomeric or dimeric state. It is interesting to note that the values of the enzyme:superoxide association rates calculated from Brownian dynamics simulations, once normalized for the number of active sites (i.e. one or two), are of the same order of magnitude for all the Cu,Zn SODs considered. In particular, the simulations show that monomeric ESOD and the virtual monomeric PSOD have almost identical substrate association rates, although they display quite different equipotential line distributions at the subunit interface. Such a ®nding indicates that the enzyme:substrate association rate may be modulated by electrostatic charges located only at relatively short distances from the copper site. This concept has recently been expressed by Zhou et al. (1997), who showed that the effects of charge mutations can be simply predicted by calculation of the interaction potential within the active site of the enzyme, the ensuing effects being roughly proportional to the distance of the mutated (charged) residue form the active site. As a whole, the electrostatic potential calculations indicate that electrostatic repulsion may prevent dimer association, but does not perturb the enzyme:substrate association rate, which is of the same order of magnitude in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic (either monomeric or dimeric) Cu,Zn SODs. A ®nal discussion item concerns the comparison between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD quaternary structure assembly. The quaternary structure of eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs has been described thoroughly before (see, e.g., Getzoff et al., 1986). Brie¯y, it is based on 19 residues provided by b-strands 1a, 2b, S-S and Greek key subloops, and by the C-terminal region, covering, in XSOD, Ê an area of 604 A2. In eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs the subunit interface residues are strictly conserved in size and polarity, providing tightly complementary molecular surfaces which exclude water molecules from the subunit contact region. Thus, the interface residues are under strong structural constraint and can accept only limited evolutionary variability (Bordo et al., 1994). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic Cu,Zn SOD dimeric assemblies display a 2-fold symmetry axis relating the interface residues and their intermolecular interactions (see Figure 1b and c). From an evolutionary standpoint this is a molecular property rather dif®cult to achieve and easily lost, since point mutation of one interface residue affects twice the intersubunit region. On the other hand, if the formation of a stable dimeric structure has speci®c structural or functional reasons, the subunit interface residues will be subject to a strict evolutionary constraint, which should make their substitution dif®cult to be accepted. Interestingly, the sequence relationship observed between the 19 XSOD subunit interface residues and the structu-

calculated on 5% randomly selected re¯ections, was used to monitor the quality of the re®nement. Ordered water molecules were located through inspection of the difference Fourier maps. Throughout the re®nement Ê cycles water molecules with B-factors exceeding 60 A2 were omitted from the model. The ®nal R-factor is Ê 0.191 for all the data observed in the 27± 2.5 A resolution range; Table 1 provides a summary of the data collection and re®nement statistics.

rally equivalent residues in ESOD and PSOD (15% and 20% residue identity, respectively) is lower than that observed in the respective whole sequence comparisons (34% amino acid identity in both XSOD:ESOD and XSOD:PSOD alignments). Such an observation is suggestive of an evolutionary pressure against the co-existence of two (potentially active) dimerization interfaces in Cu,Zn SODs, which could then spontaneously aggregate into higher oligomers, affecting the active site structure and functionality. In this respect, it should also be noted that location of the subunit interface in different molecular regions of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic Cu,Zn SODs is re¯ected by the distinct locations of the residues (and loops) mostly responsible for substrate electrostatic steering to the catalytic centre.

Three-dimensional Cu,Zn SOD models Ê Together with the 2.5 A re®ned structure of PSOD, the present analysis was based also on the atomic structures Ê of ESOD (Pesce et al., 1997), re®ned at 2.0 A resolution (R-factor 0.17), and of X. laevis Cu,Zn SOD (XSOD), Ê re®ned at 1.5 A resolution (R-factor 0.14; DjinovicCarugo et al., 1996). The latter model was selected as being the eukaryotic Cu,Zn SOD enzyme determined at the highest resolution. The conserved three-dimensional structure observed for this enzyme family allowed us to optimally superimpose the three protein structures using the method of Rossman & Argos (1976). The amino acid sequence alignment for the three Cu,Zn SODs was then based on such three-dimensional structure superposition. The protein surface accessible to the solvent was calculated as described by Kabsch & Sander (1983). In the case of PSOD, solvent accessible areas were calculated for each amino acid in one isolated subunit and in the dimeric species. Residues displaying reduced solvent accessibility in the dimeric protein were deemed part of the subunit-subunit interface. The identi®cation of interface residue clusters was performed using the program package ENVIRON (Bordo, 1993).

Methods
Crystallization and structure solution of P. leiognathi Cu,Zn SOD Crystals of recombinant PSOD were grown from protein solutions at 10 mg/ml concentration using the sitting drop crystallization technique. The protein droplet contained 5 ml stock protein solution in diluted buffer and 5 ml reservoir solution; the reservoir well contained 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4). All the experiments were run at 28 C, yielding triangular planar crystals of about 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.1 mm in about one week. A native protein data set was collected Ê at 2.5 A resolution (see Table 1) at room temperature using a MSC-Rigaku Raxis IIc image plate system coupled to a Rigaku RU-200HB rotating anode generator, run at 50 kV, 100 mA. X-ray diffraction data were reduced and processed using the MOSFLM package (Leslie, 1996) and the CCP4 program suite (CCP4, 1994). PSOD crystals belong to the rhombohedral space Ê group R32, with unit cell constants a  b  86.9 A, Ê c  99.0 A, g  120 (hexagonal setting). Calculation of the crystal packing density (Matthews, 1968) indicates that one PSOD subunit (16,000 Da) is contained per Ê asymmetric unit (Vm  3.4 A3/Da, 64% solvent content). Structure solution was achieved through molecular replacement, using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The search model was a partly re®ned molecular model of one subunit of the dimeric PSOD, which had been previously solved in our laboratory by SIRAS methods in space group C2 (unit cell constants: Ê Ê Ê a  83.4 A, b  87.7 A, c  60.6 A, b  94.4 ), based on one uranyl isomorphous derivative (Matak, D., PhD Thesis, University of Zagreb, 1997). Both the rotational and translational searches yielded unambiguous Ê solutions. The rotation search, run in the 12-3 A resolution range, produced one strong solution with a correlation coef®cient of 27.9%. The correlation coef®cient rose to 79.7% after the translational search (resolution Ê range, 15-4 A), with a corresponding R-factor of 27.8%. Rigid body re®nement of the essentially unique solution found brought the R-factor to 27.6%, in the 15Ê 2.5 A resolution range. The re®nement of the PSOD molecular model was performed using the program TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987), while the O software package (Jones et al., 1991) was used for visual inspection and manual modi®cation of the model. A free R-factor,

Prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD sequences and evolutionary trees In addition to the enzymes identi®ed in E.coli and P. leiognathi, 11 other bacterial Cu,Zn SOD genes were included in this analysis, as the result of a combined search on the EMBL, GENBANK, SWISSPROT and PIR sequence databases. In detail, genes encoding for Cu,Zn SOD have been identi®ed in the following bacterial strains (percent amino acid identity relative to the PSOD sequence is shown within parentheses): H. ducreyi (62%), A. pleuropneumoniae (62%), H. parain¯uenzae (60%), H. in¯uenzae (59%), N. meningitidis (58%), S. typhimurium (60%), B. abortus (52%), F. tularensis (57%), L. pneumophila (48%), C. crescentus (35%), and M. tuberculosis (36%). Fragments of Cu,Zn SOD genes have also been identi®ed in Pasteurella multocida (coding for 87 amino acids), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (coding for 87 amino acids), and Pasteurella haemolytica (coding for 86 amino acids). These fragments were not included in the present analysis. A multiple sequence alignment of the 13 bacterial amino acid sequences was calculated with the program package CLUSTAL-W (Thompson et al., 1994), and manually modi®ed according to the structure-based sequence alignment of PSOD and ESOD described above. Prokaryotic Cu,Zn SOD evolutionary trees were also calculated within the CLUSTAL-W package, and displayed using the program DRAWTREE (Felsenstein, 1989).

Electrostatic calculations Electrostatic potential ®elds were calculated using DelPhi version 2.2 (Klapper et al., 1986; Gilson et al., 1987), distributed by Molecular Simulations Inc. (Molecular Simulations Inc, 9685 Scranton Road, San Diego CA), run on a Vax Station DEC4000/60. The program uses the macroscopic/continuum approach, in which protein and solvent are assigned different dielectric constants and the three-dimensional structure of the protein de®nes the dielectric boundary. The potential ®eld was determined by numerically solving the linear form of the PoissonBoltzmann equation. Values of 4 and 80 were adopted for the dielectric constants of the protein and the solvent, respectively (Gilson & Honig, 1986; Klapper et al., 1986). Ê The thickness of the Stern layer was set to 2.0 A. The ionic strength of the solution was set to 0.02 M. The electrostatic potential values were calculated mapping the molecules in a 81 Â 81 Â 81 lattice, using as boundary conditions the potential values previously evaluated on a coarse grid (focussing method). The proteins were analysed at pH 7.0, considering all lysyl and arginyl sidechains protonated and all carboxyl groups ionized; a charge of 1e (e is the proton charge) was assigned to the NZ atom of lysine, 0.5e to the guanidinium NE1 and NE2 atoms of arginine, À0.5e to each carboxylate oxygen atom, and 2e to both the copper and zinc ions. A charge of 0.5e was assigned to His41, while, regarding the other metal liganding histidine residues, a charge of À1e was assigned to the imidazole of His61 (bridging Cu2 to Zn2), and a charge of 0e was assigned to the remaining histidine residues (Desideri et al., 1992). Diffusion of the superoxide anion relative to the selected Cu,Zn SOD models was calculated, as previously described (Sergi et al., 1994), by simulation of 10,000 different trajectories. Enzyme:substrate association rate constants were evaluated for the monomeric ESOD, for the dimeric PSOD and XSOD, and for a virtual monomeric PSOD and XSOD enzymes. Brownian dynamics simulations were performed on an Alpha Station DEC3000/300X. Data Bank Accession Numbers Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the re®ned PSOD structure have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977), ID codes 1bzo and r1bzosf, respectively.
