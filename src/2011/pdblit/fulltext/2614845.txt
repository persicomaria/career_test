Abstract The possibility of strong hydrogen bonding in aqueous solutions is supported by spectroscopic and chemical properties of proton sponges and internally strained dicarboxylic acid monoanions in aqueous and aqueous/acetone solutions. A species of low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) in aqueous solutions is the downfield proton in transition state analogue tetrahedral addition complexes of chymotrypsin with peptide trifluromethylketones. The LBHB proton bridges His57 and Asp102 in the hemiketal adducts of Ser195 with the peptide trifluoromethylketones. The downfield proton resonances (18.6­ 18.9 ppm, the deterium isotope shift, the low deuterium fractionation factors (0.3­ 0.4), the close contact of His57 with Asp102 in crystal structures 0 ° (#2.6 A), the high enthalpy of activation for exchange with solvent protons ðDHex 14 2 19 kcal=molÞ and the high basicity of His57 (pKa 10.6 ­ 12) all support the assignment of an LBHB. In contrast to N-acetyl-L -leucyl-L -phenylalanine trifluoromethylketone, the comparable tetrahedral addition complex of the peptide aldehyde N-acetyl-L -leucyl-L -phenylalanal with Ser195 does not lead to an LBHB between His57 and Asp102 at pHs above 7. This is attributed to the high basicity of the hemiacetal adduct (pKa . 13.5), so that the available proton in the active site resides on the hemiacetal hydroxyl group and not on His57. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Beginning in 1992, concept of the low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) entered the field of enzymatic reaction mechanisms, initially as a means of rationalizing observations of low deuterium fractionation factors observed in kinetic experiments [1,2]. Theoretical arguments for the possible participation of short strong hydrogen bonds in enzymatic catalysis were also presented [3,4]. Most specific hypotheses addressed the possibility that

strong hydrogen bonding might facilitate the enolization of substrate aldehydes, ketones, esters and carboxylic acids by stabilizing enolate ions. These ideas were vigorously criticized on theoretical grounds [5]. Physicochemical evidence of LBHBs in enzymes has accumulated, beginning with the observation of low deuterium fractionation factors and extending quickly to spectroscopic and structural information leading to the first assignment of an LBHB in a protein, that in the active site of chymotrypsin [6]. Further spectroscopic, chemical, and structural support for the LBHB bridging His57 and Asp102 in transition state analogue-complexes of chymotrypsin

Inhibitors of chymotrypsin: NAcF­CF3, N-acetyl-L -phenylalanine trifluoromethylketone; NAcGF­CF3, N-acetylglycyl-L -phenylalanine trifluoromethylketone; NAcVF­CF3, N-acetyl-L -valyl-L -phenylalanine trifluoromethylketone; NAcLF­CF3, N-acetyl-L -leucyl-L phenylalanine trifluoromethylketone; and NAcLF­CHO, N-acetyl-L -leucyl-L -phenylalaninal.

has consolidated this assignment [7 ­11]. Recently, spectroscopic, chemical, and structural evidence for the presence of an LBHB in a transition state analogue complex of D5-3-ketosteroid isomerase has also been presented [12,13]. In this paper the evidence in support of the assignment of LBHBs between His57 and Asp102 in addition complexes of peptide trifluormethyl ketones with Ser195 of chymotrypsin will be presented. The structures of chymotrypsin inhibitors discussed in this paper are given in Fig. 1, together with their abbreviated names. Four of the compounds are peptide trifluoromethyl ketones, which form hemiketal-adducts with Ser195. These adducts are regarded as close analogs of the tetrahedral intermediates in the hydrolysis of the corresponding substrates, which have alkoxyl or alkylamine groups in place of trifluoromethyl. Chymotrypsin is selective mainly for the structure of the acyl group of a substrate and much less so for the leaving group. In accord with its selectivity for an aromatic aminoacyl group and hydrophobic amino acids in the adjacent position of substrates, NAcLF ­ CF3 is the best inhibitor in Fig. 1. The corresponding compound with a methoxyl group in place of ­CF3 is

the best substrate among the corresponding methyl esters. The fifth compound, NAcLF ­ CHO forms a hemiacetal-adduct with Ser195, which as we shall see is not considered to be a close analog of the transition state. NAcLF ­CHO is a much weaker inhibitor than the peptide trifluoroketones. These compounds were developed as inhibitors within the context of studies of proteases as potential targets for drugs [14 ­ 16]. In studies of LBHBs, the inhibitors provide mechanistic information about chymotrypsin. :Peripheral information about related serine proteases such as trypsin, subtilisin, and a-lytic protease will also be presented in support of the assignment of an LBHB in the active sites of serine proteases in general. In discussion of related serine proteases, the amino acid numbering system for the active site of chymotrypsin will be used for convenience, although the true sequence numbers for the corresponding residues in the other enzymes differ from chymotrypsin. The case for strong hydrogen bonding will be built from the background literature since 1972, when the first evidence of a downfield proton in chymotrypsin appeared in the literature.

2. Catalysis by chymotrypsin Chymotrypsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of proteins into smaller polypeptides, with selectivity for cleaving at aromatic aminoacyl positions. It acts on small molecules as well as proteins, and catalyzes the hydrolysis of a large range of acyl compounds, including peptides, amides, and esters. In keeping with its selectivity in the hydrolysis of proteins, chymotrypsin is most active in catalyzing the hydrolysis of aromatic carboxylic acid amides and esters. The chemical mechanism by which chymotrypsin and other serine proteases hydrolyze acyl compounds proceeds in several steps. To a first approximation, the mechanism can be described as a two-step process with nucleophilic catalysis by the 3-hydroxyl group of a serine residue in the active site. This is formulated as Eqs. (1) and (2), in which peptide cleavage is initiated by the

residues that participate directly in catalysis, serine 195, histidine 57, and aspartate 102. Ser195 is the nucleophilic catalyst in Eqs. (1) and (2), and His57 ­ N12 serves as the Bronsted base that removes the proton from Ser195 in the acylation step (Eq. (1)). Asp102-Od1 is transannularly hydrogen bonded to His57-Nd1 and assists in acid/base catalysis. Hydrogen bonding in the `catalytic triad' of chymotrypsin is illustrated in the following structure.

ð1Þ ð2Þ reaction of serine with the acyl carbonyl group of the aromatic substrate to cleave the peptide bond, forming a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate and releasing the amine or alcohol product (Eq. (1), X ¼ NH or O). In the second step, the acyl-enzyme undergoes hydrolysis to produce the acid product (Eq. (2)). The active site of chymotrypsin includes three

The acylation of chymotrypsin (Eq. (1)) is itself a two-step process involving a metastable tetrahedral addition intermediate resulting from the addition of Ser195 to the acyl carbonyl group of the substrate. Acylation proceeds with acid/base catalysis by His57 as outlined in Fig. 2, in which Asp102 is postulated to assist in acid/base catalysis by stabilizing the tetrahedral addition complex through LBHB-formation with His57 [6]. A mechanistic issue in the chemical mechanism of acylation is that serine is generally not very reactive as a nucleophile. Nucleophilic catalysis is generally brought about by species that display high nucleophilic reactivity, species such as pyridine, imidazole or the carboxylate group. The active site of chymotrypsin includes the imidazole ring of His57, an obvious candidate as a nucleophilic catalyst. However,

156

the biochemical facts show that the nucleophile is Ser195, which is much less reactive. Somehow, the reactivity of Ser195 must be potentiated in the active site. This appears to be the role of His57, which is postulated to abstract the proton from the 3 ­ OH group of Ser195 in the transition state for the formation of the tetrahedral addition intermediate, thereby, increasing the reactivity of Ser195 as the transition state is approached. An issue in the function of His57 is its strength as a base. The imidazole ring of histidine is a very weak base ðpKa ¼ 7Þ; whereas the serine alkoxide is a very strong base ðpKa ¼ 13:4Þ [17]. For this reason, it would seem to be difficult for His57 to abstract the proton from Ser195 efficiently. A stronger base would be more effective in this role. The ideal base catalyst would be one that is intermediate in basicity between Ser195 and the leaving group, an N-terminal peptide amino group in biological substrates. The pKa values are, respectively, 13 and 9 for Ser195 and the Nterminal amino group. The ideal base catalyst should then display a pKa of 10 ­ 12, which would allow it to be strong enough as a base to abstract a proton from Ser195, but not too strong to donate a proton to the leaving amino group in the second step of the mechanism in Fig. 2. We shall see that the active site of chymotrypsin induces this property in His57, but only when a substrate or transition state analogueinhibitor is bound to the active site.

3. Hydrogen bonding in the active site of chymotrypsin In 1972, proton NMR experiments revealed a downfield proton in chymotrypsin. This proton resonated at 15 ppm at pHs above 7.5 and at 18 ppm at pHs below 4 [18]. These signals were assigned to the proton bridging His57 and Asp102, on the basis of the effects of inhibitors on the signal. The downfield signal at low pH (18 ppm) associated with the bridging proton with His57 in its conjugate acid form, protonated on N12, was regarded as an anomaly at the time. It was controversial because it was difficult to verify in other laboratories. It had been detected on a CW instrument before the advent of pulsed NMR and supercooled high field magnets. These signals and all of Robillard and Shulman's

findings were confirmed and extended to trypsin by use of more modern and more sensitive equipment [19]. The assignments of the downfield proton to the hydrogen bond bridging His57 and Asp102 were based on the use of inhibitors to exclude other hydrogen bonds in the active site. The direct assignment to this proton was originally accomplished in a related, bacterial serine protease, a-lytic protease, which could be prepared with 15N in the imidazole ring of His57. Growth of bacteria auxotrophic for histidine on histidine-15Nd1 led to the production of the enzyme with 15N specifically in position to donate a hydrogen bond to Asp102. The downfield proton NMR signal at low pH revealed a splitting corresponding to N· · ·H coupling, and this confirmed the assignment of the downfield proton [20]. The downfield (18 ppm) bridging proton, His57Nd1kkHmkOd1Asp102, in chymotrypsin at low pH was assigned as an LBHB in 1994 [6]. The downfield position could be explained by strong hydrogen bonding with Asp102, which would stretch the Nd1· · ·H bond, deshielding the proton and increasing its exposure to the external magnetic field. Other internal magnetic effects on this proton, such as ring currents or nearby paramagnetic ions, were excluded by their absence in the structure of chymotrypsin, leaving deshielding to account for the field position of this proton. At the time, the universal spectroscopic signature of the LBHB in small molecules, in which ring currents and paramagnetic ions were absent, was the downfield proton NMR signal at 16­ 21 ppm, with the exact field position depending on the participating heteroatoms [21,22]. In the case of N and O as the heteroatoms, LBHBs were found at 18­ 21 ppm. Crystal structures of chymotrypsin and other serine proteases were available at the time, and all structures ° at 1.8 A resolution were compatible with this ° hypothesis, indicating a separation of 2.6 A between His57-Nd1 and Asp102-Od1, a distance that was too close for a conventional hydrogen bond. The resolution in crystal structure of proteins before 1994 ° (1.8 A) was not high enough to allow a definitive crystallographic assignment of an LBHB. However, the structure of subtilisin was recently solved at ° 0.78 A resolution at low pH, and in this structure the proton bridging His57-Nd1 and Asp102-Od1 was

This illustrates the addition of Ser195 to the carbonyl group of NAcLF ­CF3 to form the corresponding hemiketal adduct at the active site of chymotrypsin. The value of Kd (0.2 nM) is not the same as that of the inhibition constant (KI ¼ 1 mM) because the compound is largely hydrated in solution, which a hydration constant of 4500. The other peptide trifluoromethylketones in Fig. 1 react similarly but less potently as inhibitors of chymotrypsin, with inhibition constants ranging from 10 to 40 mM.

imaged at a location between the heteroatoms, and it was modeled as an LBHB [23].

4. Hydrogen bonding in transition state analoguecomplexes The peptide trifluoromethylketones in Fig. 1 are good inhibitors of chymotrypsin and form tetrahedral addition complexes that structurally and electrostatically resemble the transition state for the reaction of a substrate to form the tetrahedral intermediate, as shown for NAcLF ­ CF3 in Fig. 3 [14 ­ 16]. The resemblance between the structure of the hemiketal of NAcLF ­ CF3 in Fig. 3 and the tetrahedral adduct in Fig. 2 is striking. They differ by the presence of ­CF3 in Fig. 3 in place of the leaving group ­NHR in Fig. 2. Inasmuch as the major specificity determinant for chymotrypsin is the structure of the aromatic acyl portion of the substrate, rather than the leaving group, the complex of chymotrypsin with NAcLF ­ CF3 is regarded as an excellent mimic of the tetrahedral intermediate. It was noted that the downfield proton was retained at 18.7 ppm in the complex of NAcLF ­ CF3 with chymotrypsin in neutral solution, and that the hydrogen bond was stronger than in chymotrypsin at pH 4 (18 ppm) [15]. In 1994, the downfield proton of the NAcLF ­CF3

complex of chymotrypsin, displaying an NMR signal corrected to 18.9 ppm, was assigned as an LBHB [6]. Like the proton in chymotrypsin at pH # 4 (18 ppm) the assignment was based primarily on the downfield position of the proton. The case for the LBHB was ° buttressed by the close contact (2.59 A) between His57-Nd1 and Asp102-Od1 in the structure of the ° complex at 1.8 A resolution [24]. The close contact ° has recently been confirmed at a resolution of 1.4 A [11]. LBHBs display additional characteristic physicochemical properties. These include low deuterium fractionation factors, deuterium isotope shifts of the downfield NMR signals, [dH ­ dD], and high values for 0 the enthalpy of exchange, DHex ; with medium protons [21,25]. The deuterium fractionation factor for the complex of NAcLF ­CF3 with chymotrypsin is 0.4, the deuterium isotope shift on the downfield NMR 0 signal is 1 ppm, and the value of DHex is 19 kcal/mol [8,10]. These values are all typical of an LBHB, in strong support of the original assignment made on the basis of the downfield proton NMR signal and the close contact in the crystal structure. The hemiketal complexes of chymotrypsin with the other peptide trifluormethylketones in Fig. 1 also display proton NMR signals between 10.6 and 18.9 ppm; and these protons display low deuterium fractionation factors 0 between 0.32 and 0.4 and high values of DHex

Fig. 4. Reaction of N-acetyl-L -leucyl-L -phenylalaninal with chymotrypsin. This illustrates the addition of Ser195 to the carbonyl group of NAcLF­CHO to form the corresponding hemiacetal adduct at the active site of chymotrypsin. The value of Kd (16 mM) is 8000 times larger than that of the corresponding trifluoromethylketone in Fig. 3.

between 14 and 19 kcal/mol [10]. LBHBs in small molecules are also characterized by special infrared spectroscopic properties [26 ­ 28]. Unfortunately, the infrared properties of LBHBs do not easily lend themselves to experiments on proteins, and so no infrared evidence for strong hydrogen bonding in enzymes is as yet available. The active site of chymotrypsinogen is regarded as more akin to the transition state than that of free chymotrypsin [29]. Studies of the downfield proton in this protein at low pH showed a low deuterium 0 fractionation factor of 0.5 and a high value of DHex (14 kcal/mol). At high pH, where His57 was not protonated and the downfield signal appeared at 15 ppm, the proton was characterized as a conventional hydrogen bond, with a fractionation factor of 0 1.0. The value of DHex was found to be lower than when His57 was protonated, but still high (10 kcal/ mol) relative to weak hydrogen bonds in free solution [29]. Theoretical treatments of strong hydrogen bonding show that SWHBs and LBHBs are significantly covalent in character [30 ­ 32]. There are very few perfectly symmetrical SWHBs [22] and elegant experiments have ruled out perfect symmetry in a number of cases [33]. However, there is clear structural proof of elongated covalent bonding and shortened hydrogen bonding in asymmetric LBHBs, and these properties are associated with downfield NMR resonances, low deuterium fractionation fac-

tors, and the other physicochemical indicators of LBHBs [21,22,34]. Theoretical analyses of strong hydrogen bonding between nitrogen and oxygen indicate that an LBHB would be asymmetric, and this is in accord with the experimental properties of the downfield protons in chymotrypsin and other serine proteases. The 15N NMR and proton NMR studies of [15N]histidine-labeled subtilisin in complex with N-acetyl-L -leucyl-L -leucine trifluoromethylketone indicated that the LBHB proton was about 20 ­ 30% transferred, consistent with an LBHB [35]. In a symmetrical hydrogen bond the proton would be 50% transferred.

5. Hydrogen bonding in a peptide aldehyde complex Peptide aldehydes also form tetrahedral addition complexes with active site residues of proteases. In the case of serine proteases such as chymotrypsin, the addition complexes are hemiacetal linkages with Ser57. The peptide aldehyde most closely related to NAcLF ­ CF3 is NAcLF ­ CHO shown in Fig. 1. This compound is an inhibitor of chymotrypsin, with a value of 16 mM for Kd [11]. The reaction and the nature of the resulting complex differ in fundamental ways from the reactions of peptide trifluoromethylketones. While a tetrahedral adduct with Ser195 is formed by NAcLF ­ CHO, the hemiacetal oxygen is

P.A. Frey / Journal of Molecular Structure 615 (2002) 153­161

159

not anionic and His57 is not protonated. The proton released from Ser195 in the course of forming the adduct is transferred to the peripheral hemiacetal oxygen and not to His57. These facts are known from the chemical properties of the reaction and the structural and spectroscopic properties of the complex [11]. In the reaction between chymotrypsin and NAcLF ­CHO protons are neither released to nor taken up from the solution. Thus, the proton from Ser195 is retained in the complex, as in the reaction of NAcLF ­CF3. However, His57 is not protonated in neutral solution, as shown by the value of 15.3 for the downfield proton. Moreover, the acetal oxygen arising from the addition of Ser195 to the carbonyl group of NAcLF ­CHO is not constrained to the oxyanion binding site formed by the peptide backbone N ­H donors in the active site. This is known from the ° structure of the complex at 1.4 A resolution, which shows that Ser195 has added to the aldehyde group from both faces to form an epimeric mixture of structures. In one of the epimers the peripheral hemiacetal-oxygen is outside the anion binding site and hydrogen bonded to His57 [11]. The obvious interpretation is that the proton from Ser195 has been bound by the peripheral hemiacetal oxygen upon complexation, leading to the neutral OH group. The OH group would derive little affinity for the peptide N ­ H hydrogen bond donors in the oxyanion binding site. The foregoing interpretation is compatible with and supported by the chemical properties of hemiacetals. Ionization of the hydrate of NAcLF ­ 13CHO serves as a model for the ionization of hemiacetals, and the pH-dependence of d13C for the hydrate shows that the value of pKa is 13.3 [11], similar to the pKa of acetaldehyde hydrate. The pKa for a hemiacetal will be higher than 13.3 owing to statistical effects. The pKa of His57 in the analogous hemiketal adduct of NAcLF ­CF3 with chymotrypsin (Fig. 3) is 12 [9] and there is no reason to expect it to be higher in the hemiacetal complex with NAcLF ­CHO (Fig. 4). Thus, the hemiacetal anion in the complex of NAcLF ­ CHO with chymotrypsin is substantially more basic than His57 in the same complex, so the proton resides on the hemiacetal. In contrast, consider the acid/base properties of the hemiketal adduct of NAcLF ­CF3 with chymotrypsin. The pKa of the hemiketal adduct of NAcLF ­ CF3 with methanol is

9.1 [15] substantially lower than the hydrate of the corresponding aldehyde owing to inductive electron withdrawal by the CF3 group. The ionization at the active site will be similar except for the acid strengthening effect of the oxyanion binding site, which affords two peptide N ­ H hydrogen bonds that stabilize the anion. The pKa of His57 in the same site is 12 [9], so that it is far more basic than the anion of the hemiketal adduct, and the proton from Ser195 goes to His57 upon adduct formation. Therefore, the proton from the 3 ­OH group of Ser195 is bound to His57 in the hemiketal complex. The anion binding site of chymotrypsin was formerly thought to stabilize the hemiketal adduct of NAcLF ­ CF3 by lowering its pKa to less than 5 from 9.1 [15]. However, this interpretation must be abandoned, because the same site does not lower the pKa of the adduct of Ser195 to NAcLF ­CHO from ca 13.5 enough to allow His57 ðpKa ¼ 12Þ to compete for the proton released from Ser195. On the basis of these observations, the stabilization to the tetrahedral adduct afforded by the oxyanion binding site cannot be more than 2 kcal/mol in terms of Gibbs free energy. Therefore, the low pKa of 5 for the peripheral oxygen in the hemiketal adduct of NAcLF ­CF3 must be attributed to another interaction in the active site. An obvious choice is the LBHB between His57 and Asp102. Aldehyde inhibitors of other enzymes may form neutral hemiacetal adducts with nucleophilic groups in active sites for the same reasons as outlined above for peptide aldehyde inhibitors of chymotrypsin. This has been specifically documented in the inactivation of prolyl peptidase by Boc-prolylprolinal [36].

6. Mechanistic implications of low barrier hydrogen bonding The tetrahedral intermediate in the action of chymotrypsin is a metastable species that has never been observed chemically or spectroscopically. As such, on the basis of the Hammond postulate, it must be similar to the transition state. An analogue as similar to the tetrahedral intermediate as the hemiketal adduct of NAcLF ­ CF3 must also be similar to the transition state. Therefore, the properties of the complexes of chymotrypsin with NAcLF ­CF3 and

160

other peptide trifluoromethylketones are thought to include important information about the chemical nature of the transition state in the acylation of chymotrypsin. The problem of providing a strong enough base to increase the reactivity of Ser195 was presented in the introduction. The formation of an LBHB between His57-Nd1 and Asp102-Od1 has been postulated to increase the basicity of His57-N12 in the formation and further reaction of the tetrahedral intermediate [6]. A close contact between His57 and Asp102, in a compression forced by the protein structure, would allow LBHB formation and increase the pKa of His57. This would be analogous to the base strengthening effect in proton sponge moledules [37,38]. In fact, the pKa of His57 in the hemiketal adduct of chymotrypsin with NAcLF ­ CF3 is 12, just between that of the leaving group amine and Ser195 [9] and 5.2 units higher than that of a histidine residue of a dipeptide in solution. The LBHBs in the chymotrypsin-peptide trifluoromethylketone complexes and the base strength of His57 in these complexes would seem to confirm the hypothesis. The foregoing considerations, together with the observation of the LBHB, led directly to the mechanism in Fig. 2 [6]. Addition of Ser195 to the peptide carbonyl is accompanied by abstraction of the serine proton by His57 and LBHB formation with Asp102. The LBHB increases the basicity of His57 in the transition state, and in the tetrahedral intermediate. In the decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate, His57 is not too basic to protonate the leaving amino group. This mechanism is compatible with the fact that either methylation of His57 [39] or mutation of Asp102 to asparagine in trypsin [40] decrease enzymatic activity by 104 ­105. Both experiments would undermine the LBHB in the mechanism of Fig. 2. A similar mechanism was postulated on the basis of 13 C NMR evidence with trypsin [41]. Authors of the latter work postulated a similar role for a His-Asp LBHB in ribonuclease; however, further experiments have have not sustained an LBHB in ribonuclease. To be correct, the foregoing hypothesis must allow for high basicity of His57 only in complexes of chymotrypsin with substrates or structurally analogous inhibitors. That is, high basicity of His57 in the free enzyme would subvert catalysis by enforcing the presence of the conjugate acid form of His57 in

neutral solution. In fact, His57 displays a pKa of 7.5 in the free enzyme. A paradox appears, however, in that His57 in free chymotrypsin also forms an LBHB with Asp102 at low pH (# 4). The question of why this LBHB does not elevate the pKa of His57 arises. The answer is not known with certainty or in detail. However, important information comes from the properties of the hemiacetal adduct of NAcLF ­ CHO with chymotrypsin. It behaves in accord with intrinsic chemical properties of hemiacetals, as described above. Another of its properties is that the ionization of His57 in this complex is similar though not identical to those of free chymotrypsin. The presence of the peptidyl moiety and the hemiacetal linkage in the active site has little effect on the acid/base properties of His57, the pKa being depressed to 6.5 relative to the 7.5 characteristic of free chymotrypsin [11]. This fact, together with other ionizing properties of tetrahedral addition complexes of chymotrypsin, leads to a hypothesis and rationale for the apparently `normal' ionization of His57 in free chymotrypsin. The hypothesis is that, while the pKa of His57 in free chymotrypsin is normal with reference to free histidine, it is elevated from what it would be in the microenvironment of the active site in the absence of the potential to form an LBHB [11]. Tetrahedral complexes similar to the transition state, that is with the anion binding site occupied by an anion and His57 protonated, display a strong propensity to have a net charge of 2 1. Any ionization that neutralizes this charge or increases it to 2 2 faces a free energy barrier of about 7 kcal/mol. This ionization barrier seems to be circumvented in the cases of free chymotrypsin and in the complex of NAcLF ­ CHO with chymotrypsin, which for the reasons stated above is not an analogue of the transition state. In these cases, His57 can ionize by protonation to neutralize the site. In both cases the ionization is accompanied by the formation of an LBHB, which should stabilize the protonated state of His57. The presence of the NAcLF-group and the hemiacetal linkage do not grossly perturb the chemistry of His57. Therefore, the apparently normal ionization chemistry of His57 in free chymotrypsin cannot be attributed to the absence of a substrate-like ligand in the active site. It follows that the postulated role of the LBHB in the action of chymotrypsin requires that the active site have the property of stabilizing an overall electrostatic

161

charge of 2 1 within the triad of Ser195, His57, and Asp102. This stabilization would present a barrier to any ionization in the active site, including the protonation of His57. Under these circumstances, the apparently normal ionization of His57 in free chymotrypsin would have to be explained by LBHBformation upon protonation. Any barrier to LBHBformation would lead to a low pKa for His57 in the free enzyme. Experiments designed to test this hypothesis are in progress.
