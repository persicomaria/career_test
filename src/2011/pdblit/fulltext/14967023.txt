ABSTRACT: S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase (MAT) catalyzes formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) from ATP and L-methionine (Met) and hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate to PPi and Pi. Escherichia coli MAT (eMAT) has been crystallized with the ATP analogue AMPPNP and Met, and the crystal structure has been determined at 2.5 Å resolution. eMAT is a dimer of dimers and has a 222 symmetry. Each active site contains the products SAM and PPNP. A modeling study indicates that the substrates (AMPPNP and Met) can bind at the same sites as the products, and only a small conformation change of the ribose ring is needed for conversion of the substrates to the products. On the basis of the ternary complex structure and a modeling study, a novel catalytic mechanism of SAM formation is proposed. In the mechanism, neutral His14 acts as an acid to cleave the C5-O5 bond of ATP while simultaneously a change in the ribose ring conformation from C4-exo to C3-endo occurs, and the S of Met makes a nucleophilic attack on the C5 to form SAM. All essential amino acid residues for substrate binding found in eMAT are conserved in the rat liver enzyme, indicating that the bacterial and mammalian enzymes have the same catalytic mechanism. However, a catalytic mechanism proposed recently by Gonzalez et al. based on the ´ structures of three ternary complexes of rat liver MAT [Gonzalez, B., Pajares, M. A., Hermoso, J. A., ´ Guillerm, D., Guillerm, G., and Sanz-Aparicio. J. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 331, 407] is substantially different from our mechanism.

In biological systems, there are a myriad of reactions in which methyl groups are transferred from a few types of methyl donors to a wide variety of methyl acceptors. Among biological methyl group donors, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),1 discovered by Cantoni in 1953 (1), is the most widely used, while 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, methylcobalamin, and betaine are involved in far fewer methylation reactions.

The formation of SAM is catalyzed solely by S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (MAT, ATP:L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.6), and occurs in an unusual two-step reaction in which the complete tripolyphosphate chain is cleaved from ATP as SAM is formed, and the tripolyphosphate is further hydrolyzed to PPi and Pi before the sulfonium product (SAM) is released, giving the overall reaction shown (2).

Thus, the enzyme must catalyze reactions at both ends of the tripolyphosphate chain, which appears to be a unique catalytic task. The SAM forming reaction was found by stereochemical and kinetic isotope studies to occur as an SN2 reaction with direct attack of the sulfur of methionine on

1822 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 7, 2004 the C5 atom of ATP (3, 4). Cantoni originally reported that divalent metals are essential for activity (1). Details of the catalytic mechanism of MAT have been studied by using various methods including kinetic measurements (5, 6), EPR spectroscopic studies (7, 8), mutagenesis studies (9-13), computational modeling studies (14), NMR studies (15), and numerous inhibition studies by Met and ATP analogues that have inhibitory activity against the enzyme (16-20). The first crystal structure of eMAT containing two Pi showed a unique polypeptide folding including a knot formation at the N-terminus (21, 22). The second crystal structure of eMAT crystallized with ATP contained ADP and Pi in the active site (eMAT:(ADP+Pi)), and showed a possible PPPi binding site of ATP, but the binding site of the adenosine moiety was not clearly identified due to disorder (23). A loop (flexible loop) composed of the amino acid residues 98-108 was disordered in the eMAT structures. The substrate-free eMAT structure showed that the flexible loop hung above the active site, and was involved in the catalytic activity (24). Recently, the crystal structure of rat liver MAT complexed with a methionine analogue L-2amino-4-methoxy-cis-but-3-enoic acid (AMB), rMAT: (AMB+2SO4), has been determined at 2.7 Å resolution (25). rMAT has 15 additional amino acid residues at the Nterminus with respect to eMAT, and the polypeptide folds in the same fashion as observed in eMAT. Therefore, the structure of rMAT confirms the unusual knot structure found in the N-terminal section of eMAT structure. From the rMAT:(AMB+2SO4) structure, the Met binding site and the disulfide linkage that differentiates rMAT I (a tetramer) and rMAT III (a dimer composed of the same subunit) have been proposed. When AMPPNP instead of ATP is used along with Met as the substrates, SAM formation occurs but the PPNP hydrolysis is inhibited (5). Thus, crystals of a stable ternary complex can be grown from the solution containing eMAT, AMPPNP, and Met. Here we report a crystal structure of eMAT ternary complex (eMAT:(SAM+PPNP)). On the basis of the new structure, a detailed catalytic mechanism of SAM formation is proposed. It is noted that three ternary complex structures of rMAT have recently been published (26). The locations of ATP and Met binding sites are completely different from the sites seen in the Escherichia coli enzyme. The structures of the rMAT complexes have several unusual features, such as unreacted ATP and Met in the active site and very large temperature factors of the molecules and ions in the active site. The proposed catalytic mechanism based on those ternary complex structures is substantially different from our mechanism and requires a large movement of ATP within the active site (26). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallization. eMAT was prepared from E. coli strain DM50pK8, a strain that harbors the plasmid pK8 which contains the structural gene for the enzyme. The enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using methods previously described (5). A mixture of eMAT (36 mg/mL), AMPPNP (5 mM), and Met (10 mM) in 50 mM Hepes-K+ buffer pH 8.0 containing KCl (50 mM), MgCl2 (10 mM), and DTT (5 mM) was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The

mixture was diluted with 50 mM Hepes-K+ buffer to a protein concentration of 20 mg/mL. Hanging drops were made with equal volumes of the protein mixture and a crystallization solution containing 8%(v/w) PEG-8000, 50 mM Tris/ HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 20% ethylene glycol. Thick plate shaped crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were grown at 23 °C for 1 day. Data Measurement. A crystal (0.3 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm) in a hanging drop was scooped up with a nylon loop and was frozen in cold nitrogen gas (-180 °C) on a Rigaku RAXIS imaging plate X-ray diffractometer with a rotating anode X-ray generator as an X-ray source (CuKR radiation operated at 50 KV and 100 mA). The X-ray beam was focused to 0.3 mm by confocal optics (Osmic, Inc., USA). The diffraction data were measured up to 2.5 Å resolution at -180 °C. The data were processed with the program DENZO/SCALEPACK (27). Data statistics are given in Table 1. It is noted that the unit cell dimensions were determined during examination of crystal qualities, and most of those values were significantly different from each other, indicating that the eMAT complexes can pack differently in the crystals. Crystal Structure Determination. The unit cell dimensions and space group (P212121) indicate that an asymmetric unit contains one tetrameric enzyme. The crystal structure was determined by a molecular replacement procedure using an eMAT dimer as the search model. The model structure was refined with the POSITIONAL protocol and then the simulated annealing procedure of X-PLOR (28). The missing polypeptide chain for the amino acid residues 98-108 was built in (2Fo - Fc) maps. (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc) maps showed two large significant residual electron density peaks in the region of active site (Figure 1). Since eMAT was crystallized in the presence of an excess of AMPPNP (5 mM) and L-Met (10 mM) and a characterization study has suggested that the substrates are rapidly converted to the products (SAM and PPNP) in the active site (5), these peaks were assigned to SAM and PPNP. The model containing

the products in the active sites was refined with the simulated annealing procedures of X-PLOR. During the refinement, the model structure was restrained by 222 noncrystallographic symmetries. Two residual peaks near the PPNP moiety in each subunit were assigned to Mg2+ ions. The highest residual peak except for the products in the each active site was assigned to the K+ ion. The Mg2+ and K+ ions were located at the same sites in all four subunits. Other well-defined residual peaks in the active sites were assigned to water molecules. Each monomer including products and metal ions in the dimer were restrained by a noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS). The NCS weight in the X-PLOR refinement was set to 100. The model was refined with all data (no sigma cut) within a 2.5 Å resolution.

A Modeling of eMAT:(AMPPNP+Met). As shown in Figure 1, the residual electron density peaks in the dimer AB suggested a possibility of the substrates (AMPPNP and Met) in the active site. Therefore, the model containing the substrates in the dimer AB and the products in the dimer CD was refined by the same procedures described above. Compared to the eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) structure, there was no significant movement of atoms except for C5 of the adenosine moiety of AMPPNP. The R and Rfree values did not changed. A superimposed view of the products and substrates is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The refined coordinates are deposited along with the coordinates containing the products (SAM and PPNP) in the both dimers (PDB code: 1P7L, 1RG9).

RESULTS OVerall Structure. The crystallographic refinement parameters (Table 1), final (2Fo - Fc) maps, and conformational analysis by PROCHECK (29) indicate that the crystal structure of a ternary complex eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) has been determined successfully. The crystal structure contains one tetramer (i.e., four identical subunits) in the asymmetric unit. The two subunits A and B interact with each other relatively strongly and form a dimer. Similarly, C and D form a dimer as well. The contact surfaces between the two subunits A and B, and the two dimers AB and CD are calculated to be 2700 and 1800 Å2, respectively (30). Thus, eMAT is a dimer of dimers and has a noncrystallographic 222 symmetry. The four subunits are structurally identical with the maximum rmsd of 0.13 Å. The rmsd between two dimers (AB and CD) is 0.18 Å, indicating that the two dimers have the same subunit associations. The polypeptide-folding scheme of each subunit is similar to those of complexes of eMAT:(2Pi) (21), eMAT:(ADP+Pi) (23), rMAT:(AMB+2SO4) (25), rMAT:(AEP+3PO4) (26), rMAT:(ATP+Met) (26), rMAT:(ATP+AEP) (26), and rMAT:(ADP+AMB) (26). Two active sites are located between two subunits forming a dimer. Each active site contains the products SAM and PPNP. The electron density peaks of SAM and PPNP in dimer AB and in dimer CD are shown in Figure 1. Since the active sites are formed with amino acid residues from the two subunits, the amino acid residue number with an asterisk indicates that it belongs to the partner subunit of the dimer. ActiVe Site Contents. SAM formation from ATP and Met catalyzed by MAT is a two-step reaction as illustrated in the introduction. The overall reaction is an exergonic process because of the PPPi hydrolysis. Since eMAT cannot hydrolyze the -phosphate of the PPNP group cleaved from AMPPNP, the catalytic reaction stops after formation of SAM and PPNP (5). The products are trapped in the active site because the PPPi hydrolysis energy is not available. For this reason, the active sites of eMAT should contain SAM and PPNP. Indeed, the (Fo - Fc) maps show clearly the products (SAM and PPNP) in the active sites of dimer CD (Figure 1). However, the residual electron density peaks in

dimer AB show two possibilities (i.e., substrate (AMPPNP and Met) or products (SAM and PPNP)). In the crystal structure, dimer AB has more contacts with neighboring molecules than dimer CD does, suggesting that dimer CD has more vibrational freedom than dimer AB in the crystal. Indeed, the mean temperature factor of dimer CD is significantly larger than that of dimer AB (23.6 vs 15.5 Å2). When molecular packing forces reduce the thermal vibration of the enzyme, the reverse reaction could occur and the trapped products (SAM and PPNP) could move back to the substrate (AMPPNP and Met) in the active site. On the basis of the above assumption, the model containing the substrates in dimer AB and the products in dimer CD was refined by the same procedures in the experimental section. Compared to the eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) structure, there was no significant movement of atoms except for the C5 of the adenosine moiety of AMPPNP (Figure 2). The substrates (AMPPNP and Met) maintain the exact same hydrogen bonds with the enzyme as observed in the product structure. The R and Rfree values did not change, indicating that it is impossible to determine the actual contents in the active site by the X-ray analysis. However, this modeling attempt indicates that the substrates (AMPPNP and Met) can bind at the same sites as the products and only a small conformation change of the ribose ring is needed in conversion of the substrates to the products. The ribose ring of SAM has a C3-endo conformation (3E, P ) 18°,  ) 40°) and the C5 is connected to the SD of Met, whereas the ribose ring in AMPPNP has a C4-exo conformation (4E, phase angle of pseudorotation (P ) 53°, puckering amplitude  ) 56°) and the C5 is connected to the O5 of PPNP. This difference in the ribose ring conformations of bound AMPPNP and SAM is consistent with that seen in previous NMR studies (15). Interactions between the Enzyme and Products in the ActiVe Site. Figure 3 shows the possible hydrogen bonds between the products and eMAT. The adenine ring of SAM is recognized by a hydrogen bond (N6,,,O[Arg229]) and a stacking interaction with the phenyl ring of Phe230. There are three water binding sites (Wat411, Wat413, and Wat416) around the adenine ring. The Wat411 site near the N1 is

The same hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds are observed in a model structure of eMAT:(AMPPNP+Met), and the distances of C5-O5 and C5,,,SD are 1.51 and 3.12 Å, respectively.

1826 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 7, 2004 surrounded by O[Asn225], N[Thr227], and OG[Thr227]. The Wat411 sites in all subunits are occupied by a water molecule. The Wat413 site near N3 is surrounded by OD1[Asp118*], OE1[Gln119*], and OG[Ser186]. The Wat413 sites in subunits A and B are occupied by a water molecule. The Wat416 site near N6 and N7 is surrounded by OG[Ser99*] and O[Ile232]. The Wat416 sites in subunits C and D are also occupied by a water molecule. These water-mediated hydrogen bonds connect the adenine ring to the protein. The 2-OH and 3-OH of adenosine ribose interact with the two acidic amino acid residues Asp163 and Asp238 (O2,,,OD1[Asp163] and O3,,,OD2[Asp238]). Similar interactions between the OH groups of SAM/SAH and the acidic amino acid residues are seen in the structures of methyltransferase: SAM/SAH complexes (31-48). The Met moiety is recognized by four hydrogen bonds, in which the amino group (N) forms hydrogen bonds with the acidic amino acid residues (N,,,OE2[Glu55*] and N,,,OD1[Asp238]), and the carboxylate group forms hydrogen bonds with the neutral/basic amino acid residues (O1,,,NE2[Gln98*] and O1,,,NZ[Lys269*]). In addition to these hydrogen bonds, two water molecules form hydrogen bonds with O1 and O2, respectively. One water molecule is located in the Wat401 site in the all subunits and is connected to O[Gly117*] and NZ[Lys269*]. The other water molecule occupies the Wat402 site in subunits A and B or the Wat403 site in subunits C and D. The Wat402 and Wat403 sites are surrounded by N[Ser99*] and O[Gly237], and by O[Arg38] and NZ[Lys269*], respectively. Apparently, the Met moiety of SAM is tightly bound to the protein by direct and watermediated hydrogen bonds. As shown in Figure 3, the PPNP ion is heavily involved in hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. The PPNP ion has a U-shaped conformation. Two magnesium ions (Mg2+) interact with the phosphate oxygens from both sides of the U-shaped PPNP ion. One of the magnesium ions (Mg387) makes two ionic bonds with O1A and O1C, and is surrounded by Glu8, Asp118*, and Asp271*. The carboxylate groups of Glu8, Asp118*, and Asp271* are located outside the ionic bond distance to Mg387, indicating that a few disordered water molecules are located between the carboxylate groups and the Mg2+ ion. The other magnesium ion (Mg388) is held by Asp16 and forms three ionic bonds with three oxygens (O2A, O2B, and O2C). It is noted that the coordination geometries of these Mg2+ ions are not an idealized bipyramid due to disordered water molecules surrounding the Mg2+ ions. One potassium ion (K+) is located near O2B and is surrounded by three additional oxygens (OE2[Glu42*], OD1[Asp238], and O[Cys239]). The K,,,O interactions are apparently weak (K,,,O distances are 2.8  3.5 Å), and the K+ ion is far from the catalytic site, suggesting that it is not directly involved in the catalytic reaction. Indeed, a relatively high concentration of K+ (> 5 mM) is required for the halfmaximal activation (5). Therefore, the role of the K+ ion in the active site appears to be the maintenance of the active site geometry rather than the stabilization of the negatively charged PPPi moiety for the catalysis. The PA phosphate moiety interacts with three basic amino acid residues with five hydrogen bonds (O4A,,,NE2[His14], O1A,,,NZ[Lys165], O4A,,,NZ[Lys165], O1A,,,NZ[Lys245], O2A,,,NZ[Lys245]). Similarly, the PC phosphate moiety interacts with three basic amino acid residues/group through

The bridging nitrogen N3B makes a hydrogen bond with an acidic amino acid residue Asp271* (N3B,,,OD1[Asp271*]). The C4-H of ribose points to O4A of the PA phosphate with the C4,,,O4A distance of 3.1 Å, suggesting a C-H,,,O hydrogen bond. It is noted that, without any exception, the basic and acidic groups of the Met and PPNP moieties interact with acidic and basic amino acid residues, respectively, suggesting that the structure of a ternary complex of eMAT has been determined successfully. All essential amino acid residues for substrate binding found in the E. coli enzyme are conserved in the rat liver enzyme, indicating that the bacterial and mammalian enzymes have a similar catalytic mechanism (Table 2). A Role of the Flexible Loop (Residues 98-108). As shown in Figure 4, the products are completely surrounded by amino acid residues, and thus the apparent entrance of the active site is not recognizable in the ternary complex structure. On the other hand, the flexible loop composed of the amino acid residues 98-108 is disordered in the binary complex structures, and thus the entrance to the active site is clearly recognizable. Therefore, the flexible loop acts as a gate to the active site. Since the flexible section does not have any contacts with the neighboring molecules in the crystal structure, the order-disorder conformational change of the flexible loop is not due to the crystal packing effects. DISCUSSION Differences between the eMAT Ternary and Binary Complex Structures. The crystal structures of eMAT binary complexes, eMAT:(2Pi), eMAT:(PPi+Pi), eMAT:(ADP+Pi), have been determined (21, 23). Since these structures are very similar to each other including the Pi and PPi binding sites, we will compare the structure of eMAT:(ADP+Pi) to the structure of eMAT:(SAM+PPNP). The overall polypeptide folding of eMAT in the complexes is quite similar, except for the flexible loop composed of the amino acid residues 98-108. The flexible loop is ordered in eMAT: (SAM+PPNP), whereas the same loop is invisible (disordered) in the other eMAT and rMAT structures. The ordered

The active site contents of eMAT:(SAM+PPNP), eMAT:(ADP+Pi), and rMAT:(ATP+Met+2Pi) are illustrated by magenta, aquamarine, and white colored bonds, respectively. The Mg2+ and K+ ions are illustrated by small and large circles, respectively. The CA atoms of eMAT: (ADP+Pi) and rMAT:(ATP+Met) were superimposed on the corresponding CA atoms of eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) by a least-squares method, and the protein parts were removed from the figure.

flexible loop in eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) partially occupies the adenine ring binding site seen in eMAT:(ADP+Pi). A superimposed view of the active sites of eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) and eMAT:(ADP+Pi) is shown in Figure 5. The PPNP ion binds at the same site of diphosphate of ADP seen in eMAT(ADP+Pi). However, the orientation of the pyrophosphate moiety of ADP is reversed (i.e., the Rand -phosphates of ADP superimpose on the - and R-phosphate sites of PPNP, respectively). For this reason, the adenosine moiety of ADP lies on the opposite side of the active site. The bound Met occupies the adenosine binding site seen in eMAT:(ADP+Pi). Mg2+ ions in both eMAT:(ADP+Pi) and eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) bind around the Pi, PPi, and PPNP moieties. There are significant differences in the K+ binding sites in the binary and ternary complexes. As seen in Figure 5 and described above, there are several significant differences among the active site structures of eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) and eMAT:(ADP+Pi). One difference is the adenosine moiety binding sites in the structures of eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) and eMAT:(ADP+Pi). This could be due to the differences between the binary and ternary complexes. There is a relatively large empty space in the active site of the binary eMAT:(ADP+Pi) complex, and thus,

the adenosine moiety of ADP can be located in several sites (i.e., disorder), which is consistent with the known very low affinity of the enzyme for ADP (a Ki > 10 mM compared to the ATP KM of 0.1 mM) (5). On the other hand, there is no empty space in the ternary eMAT:(SAM+PPNP) complex, and thus the adenosine moiety of SAM and the Met must locate their correct sites to fit into the active site. Indeed, the adenosine moiety of ADP has relatively large temperature factors (the mean temperature factor is above 100 Å2, although that of pyrophosphate moiety is 30 Å2) and has little interaction with the protein, indicating that the adenosine moiety is disordered. In eMAT:(SAM+PPNP), the adenosine moiety of SAM has a well-defined electron density and is ordered (the mean temperature factor is 13.5 Å2). From a functional standpoint, another explanation is that the MAT active site is designed to differentiate between ADP and ATP since ATP and AMPPNP are substrates but ADP is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor. As will be described below, if ADP bound to MAT in the same way as AMPPNP, ADP would be a substrate. Differences between the eMAT and rMAT Ternary Complex Structures. Recently, Gonzalez et al. published two ´ binary and three ternary complex structures of rMAT (25,

26), each with additional active site bound anions. Those are rMAT:(AMB+2SO4), rMAT:(AEP+3PO4), rMAT: (ATP+Met+2Pi), rMAT:(ATP+AEP+2Pi), and rMAT: (ADP+AMB+3Pi). The crystals of these complexes were isomorphous to each other, but not to the eMAT complexes. The rMAT is also a tetramer and has a 222 symmetry. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains one dimer, and two dimers are related by the crystallographic 2-fold axis. The N-terminal residues and the flexible loop are disordered. Although polypeptide folding in rMAT is very similar to that of eMAT, the binding sites of molecules and ions in the active sites of the rMAT ternary complexes are quite different from the corresponding sites seen in eMAT: (SAM+PPNP) (Figure 5). There are five unusual features in the rMAT ternary complexes (rMAT:(ATP+Met+2Pi), rMAT:(ATP+AEP+2Pi), rMAT:(ADP+AMB+3Pi)) (26). Those are the following: (i) Although MAT has a 222 symmetry and obeys hyperbolic kinetics, one of the two active sites of the dimer is always empty. (ii) Although the catalytic rate of MAT is faster than one turnover per second, one complex contains the substrates (ATP and Met) in the active site. (iii) Although Pi is a competitive inhibitor of ATP, the ternary complexes contain both ATP and Pi in the active site. (iv) Many charged groups in the active site do not interact with charged amino acid residues. (v) The average temperature factor of the molecules and ions in the active is much higher than that of the protein (see Table 3). These observations suggest that the rMAT ternary complexes contain a low occupancy of the substrates or inhibitors in their active site, and, thus, the binding schemes of ATP, Met, and metals are quite questionable. Interestingly, the rMAT:(ATP+Met+2Pi) complex was formed by soaking ATP into crystals of the rMAT:(Met+2Pi) complex because cocrystallization was not successful, and the active site loop remained disordered, suggesting that the functional state of the enzyme might not have been observed. Therefore, it may not be of functional significance to compare the eMAT ternary complex to the rMAT ternary complexes. Catalysis Requires Tight Binding of Substrates and the Flexible Loop MoVement. On the basis of the structures of eMAT:(ADP+Pi), eMAT:(SAM+PPNP), and eMAT: (AMPPNP+Met) deduced by a modeling study, a detailed catalytic mechanism of SAM formation is proposed here. The enzyme has at least two different conformations primarily due to distinct conformations of the active site loop. One is an open conformation seen in eMAT:(ADP+Pi), in

which the flexible loop is disordered, and thus the entrance to the active site is opened. The substrates and products can freely enter or leave the active site. The other one is a closed conformation seen in eMAT:(SAM+PPNP), in which the loop has an ordered conformation and blocks the entrance to the active site (Figure 4). Gln98, Ser99, and Asp101 in the flexible loop are involved in the substrate binding. In the closed conformation, entrance of the substrates into the active site or release the products from the active site are restricted because the active site entrance is blocked. ATP, 2Mg2+ ions, and Met enter the active site when the enzyme has an open conformation. Initially, the tripolyphosphate group of ATP is recognized by basic amino acid residues (His14, Lys165, Arg244, Lys245, Lys265*) and is tightly bound to the protein by hydrogen and ionic bonds. These interactions are consistent with previous mutagenesis studies (10). The adenosine moiety of ATP and the Met are then bound to the specific sites, respectively. The adenine ring stacks with the phenyl ring of Phe230, and the 2-OH and 3-OH of ribose form hydrogen bonds with Asp163 and Asp238, respectively. The functional significance of these interactions appears to differ since 3-deoxy-ATP is a good substrate whereas 2-deoxy-ATP is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor (5). The amino and carboxylate groups of Met form hydrogen bonds with acidic amino acid residues (Glu55*, Asp238) and a basic amino acid residue (Lys269*), respectively. In this context, it is noteworthy that the K269M mutated enzyme had a 100-fold increase in the KM for methionine (10). It is noted that Asp238 connects the bound Met and the ribose of ATP through hydrogen bonds. Finally, the flexible loop enters the active site and binds to the substrates through water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The two substrates are now firmly bound to the protein by polar and nonpolar interactions. Proposed Catalytic Mechanism. As shown in Figure 2, there is no need for significant movement of the adenosine, Met, and PPNP moieties before and after the SAM formation reaction. The major difference is seen in the conformations (C4-exo and C3-endo) of the ribose rings of AMPPNP and SAM. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose the following events: The C5-O5 bond of ATP is cleaved simultaneously with formation of the bond between C5 and the electronrich SD of the bound Met by changing the ribose ring conformation from C4-exo to C3-endo. As shown in Figure 6, the NE2 of His14 forms a hydrogen bond with O5 of AMPPNP (O5,,,NE2 ) 2.85(2) Å), and the ND1 of His14 is surrounded by the two amide groups of Asp16 and Lys17 within hydrogen bond distance (ND1,,,N[Asp16] ) 3.05(2) Å, ND1,,,N[Lys17] ) 3.69(2) Å). In this geometry, the imidazole ring of His14 can be

polarized so that the proton on NE2 is readily released to O5 of ATP. The C5-O5 bond cleavage is initialized when a molecular vibration allows the amide groups of Asp16 and Lys17 to form strong hydrogen bonds with ND1 of His14. Then, a series of electron movements take place from the CE1-ND1 bonding electron to the C5-O5 bonding electron through the O5,,,NE2 hydrogen bond, and the C5-O5 bond is cleaved and the O5-H bond is formed in the PPPi coproduct (Figure 7). The negatively charged ND1 of His14 is stabilized by the surrounding basic amide groups of Asp16 and Lys17. The positively polarized C5 moves toward the

electron-rich SD of the bound Met by changing the ribose ring conformation from C4-exo to C3-endo. The SD performs a nucleophilic attack on the C5 to form SAM and displace PPPi. The negative charge on ND1 of His14 moves back to the O5 of PPPi and is stabilized by forming a C4-H,,,O5 hydrogen bond (C4,,,O5 ) 3.10 Å). Although the mechanism is described above in sequential fashion, the C5-O5 bond cleavage and the C5-SD bond formation occur in a concerted manner, i.e., the proposed SAM formation is a SN2 reaction. This proposed catalytic mechanism is consistent with previous mutational studies which

1830 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 7, 2004 showed >1000-fold reductions in Vmax when the mutation H14N was made (10). In contrast, the Vmax diminished only 2.5-fold in the K165M mutant, indicating that interactions with Lys165 are of lesser importance in catalysis. The product SAM in this crystal structure has an S-configuration at the SD atom, and the naturally occurring SAM has the S-configuration as well (49, 50), supporting the proposed catalytic mechanism. As observed in most nucleoside and nucleotide structures, the glycosidic bonds of ATP and SAM molecules in this crystal structure are anticonformation. For the overall conformation, the substrate ATP has an extended conformation, whereas the product SAM has a bent conformation. Since SAM and SAH (demethylated SAM) in the known methyltransferase structures (31-48) and in solution (14) have extended conformations, the bent conformation in this structure would be an unfavorable one and would facilitate the release of SAM from the active site. It is noted that SAM can have a bent conformation in the protein complex if it has a rare synglycosidic bond as seen in the Met repressor complex (51). Proposed Mechanism Is Quite Unique. In general, when a neutral His residue is involved in a general acid-base catalysis, an acidic group polarizes the His residue to act as a base. A typical example is seen in serine protease reaction mechanisms (52). In the contrast to the well-known protease examples, we propose that two basic amide groups polarize neutral His14 to act as an acid on the basis of the geometry around the O5 of AMPPNP/SAM (Figure 6). Lodi and Knowles have proposed a similar catalytic mechanism of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), in which a neutral His95 acts as an acid (53). Interestingly, His95 in the crystal structure of TIM (PDB code: 2YPI) is surrounded by two amide groups of Ser96 and Glu97 with the ND1,,,N distances of 2.91 and 3.02 Å, respectively (54). Since the 12EGHPDK17 sequence is conserved in all known MAT genes (55-65) and TIM has a similar 93LGHSER98 sequence, we searched for the sequence GHxYZ (where x ) any; Y ) acidic residue; Z ) basic residue) in the PDB files and found 220 structures. However, none of them except for MAT and TIM has the unique His-amide group interaction. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We express our thanks to Professor Richard H. Himes and Richard L.
