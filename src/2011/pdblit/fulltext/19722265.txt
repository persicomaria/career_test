INTRODUCTION Prp40 protein was originally identified as a suppressor of 50 end U1 RNA point mutations.1 Prp40 is a U1 snRNP-associated protein that participates in the early steps of yeast premessenger RNA splicing. Prp40 associates with the branch-binding point protein to bring the 50 splicing site and the intron branch point into spatial proximity.2 Additionally, Prp40 has been implicated in the binding to the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (herein referred as phospho-CTD) of RNA polymerase II through regions involving the WW and FF domains.3 However, a subsequent study on the structure of the Prp40 WW domain pair also showed that, in the absence of additional FF domains, the WW domains do not interact with the phospho-CTD repeats.4 The solution structure of the first FF domain of Prp40 has been determined.5 That study also examined the binding of Prp40FF1 to the splicing factor Clf1 and to a pair of bisphospho-CTD repeats. The binding site for the association with the first TPR motif of Clf1 involves the helices a2, the 310, and the N-terminal half of a3. In contrast, no interaction was detected for the Prp40FF1 domain with the phospho-CTD repeats and for the Prp40FF4 domain with the TPR motif of Clf1.5 Recently, other ligand partners have been identified for Prp40 FF domains, namely Snu71, a component of U1 snRNP, and Luc7, a splicing factor associated with U1 snRNP involved in the 50 splicing site recognition.6­8 Furthermore, it was shown that only the region comprising the first two FF domains of Prp40 is critical for yeast viability, whereas the deletion of the region including

FF3 and FF4 results in a slow-growth phenotype.6 These results are in agreement with a previous report that showed that a deletion of the FF1 domain and a fragment of FF2 of Prp40 caused yeast lethality.9 To further study the remaining FF domains present in Prp40, we cloned and produced constructs corresponding to the FF2, FF3, and FF4 domains. Of these, only the constructs corresponding to FF4 gave a folded and stable sample. Indeed, several constructs spanning FF2 and FF3 and even that of the FF1-2 pair were either partially structured or unstable after refolding from inclusion bodies. Here we report the solution structure of the Prp40FF4 domain. Furthermore, prompted by the observation that the charge distribution of the FBP11FF1 region involved in the interaction with the bisphospho-CTD repeats10 is partially conserved in Prp40FF4, we also examined whether this domain also interacted with the phosphoCTD repeats, but no binding was detected under our experimental conditions. METHODS
Sample preparation

NMR spectroscopy

Triple resonance spectra were recorded at 285K on either Bruker DRX-600 or Bruker DRX-800 NMR spectrometers. Homonuclear experiments 2D TOCSY (65millisecond mixing time) and 2D NOESY (120-millisecond mixing time) were acquired on a Bruker- DRX-800 NMR spectrometer. All spectra were processed with the NMRPipe/NMRDraw software12 and analyzed with CARA.13 For the NMR titrations with the phosphoCTD, 15N-Prp40FF4 short and extended constructs were prepared at 0.2 mM, and unlabeled ligand was added to a final ratio of 1:3. Heteronuclear 15N-NOE values were measured on a 0.5-mM 15N-labeled sample at 285K as described.14

Structure calculation

Distance restraints derived from fully assigned peaks in NOESY experiments were used for structure calculation together with 3J(HN, Ha) and hydrogen bond restraints obtained from HNHA and D2O exchange experiments, respectively. The structures were calculated with the programs CNS15 and ARIA 2.0.16 The 15 lowest-energy structures were analyzed with PROCHECK-NMR,17 and the statistics from the analysis are shown in Table I. MOLMOL18 and PyMOL19 were used to visualize the structures and generate the figures.

hSAi refers to the ensemble of the ten structures with the lowest energy. R.m.s. deviation between the ensemble of structures hSAi and the lowest energy structure. c No distance restraint in any of the structures included in the ensemble was ° violated by more than 0.3A. d EL-J is the Lennard-Jones van der Waals energy calculated using the CHARMMPARMALLH6 parameters. EL-J was not included in the target function during the structure calculation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We determined the solution structure of the yeast Prp40 FF4 domain using standard multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The final ensemble of the 15 lowest energy conformers is shown in Figure 1(A), and the structural statistics are summarized in Table I. Like other previously described FF domains,5,10,11 Prp40FF4 folds as a compact four-helical bundle, with a a1-a2-310-a3 topology [Fig. 1(B)]. The helices comprise residues Glu489-Thr507 (a1), Trp519-Leu526 (a2), Tyr532-Gly536 (310), and Asp539-Phe549 (a3), respectively. Each helix is connected to the other helices through long-range NOEs. For instance, Tyr532, located in the 310 helix, is in contact with residues in a1 (Phe500 and Leu503), a2 (Ser523), and a3 (Arg542). The loop connecting the first two alpha helices exhibits distinct features in Prp40FF4 compared with other FF structures. A superimposition of Prp40FF4 to Prp40FF1 and URN1FF shows that the loop in Prp40FF4 presents an extra turn as a consequence of the insertion of five amino acids in the FF4 sequence [superimposition of structures and sequences

Homology models

Prp40 FF2 and FF3 homology models were generated by MODELLER9v620 with the multiple template mode using several known FF structures and a multiple structure-based alignment of the FF family.

Peptide synthesis

The sequence SYpSPTpSPSYpSPTpSPSY corresponding to a doubly phosphorylated pair of repeats of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II was manually synthesized using Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis and Rink amide matrix.21 The peptide was cleaved from the resin with a TFA 95%/H2O 2.5%/TIS 2.5% mixture, precipitated in cold ether, and purified by HPLC in a C4 reverse phase column (Vydac) using a water-acetonitrile gradient.

shown in Fig. 1(C,D), respectively]. Although the loop is longer than in other structures, its flexibility is not increased, as shown by heteronuclear NOE experiments and the numerous NOE peaks observed with residues in the alpha helices (i.e., Lys515 side-chain with the rings of Trp501 [in a1] and Phe546 [in a3] or Pro516 with Ala522 [in a2] and Phe546). Remarkably, the hydroxyl groups of Thr507 and Tyr508 (in the beginning of the loop) participate in a network of NOEs with methyl groups of Leu503 and Leu504 and side-chains of Pro516, Glu525, and Leu526, respectively. Accordingly, both side chains are well defined in the structure. For the binding experiments, we also prepared a second construct of the Prp40FF4 domain that included a

predominantly positively charged 23-amino acid extension at the N-terminus. Like Prp40FF1, Prp40FF4 (long and short constructs) showed no binding to a pair of bisphospho-CTD repeats under our experimental conditions. The phospho-CTD binding site in FBP11FF1 was located in a positively charged region comprising the N-terminal of helices a1 and a3.10 In Prp40FF1, this region is mainly negatively charged and therefore unfavorable for the phospho-CTD binding, whereas in Prp40FF4 the region comprising the N-terminal of helices a1 and a3 is rather positively charged with two small negatively charged patches [Fig. 1(E)]. In contrast, homology models of FF2 and FF3 domains [Fig. 1(E)] show a charge distribution in the potential binding site

for the bisphospho-CTD highly similar to that of FBP11FF1. Thus, regions of Prp40 including FF2 and/or FF3 may be involved in the interaction with the phospho-CTD repeats of RNA polymerase II. Nevertheless, as discussed in the study by Ester and Uetz,6 data available to date on FF domain interactions with distinct ligands do not allow us to formulate confident predictions about FF domain binding specificities. More studies on their interactions are required to gain further insight into FF binding modes.
