Vaults consist of multiple copies of three proteins (MVP, VPARP, and TEP1) and several untranslated RNAs. The function of vaults is unknown but the typical and evolutionary conserved structure indicates a role in intracellular transport. Although all vault components have been identified and characterized, not much is known about vault protein assembly. In this study we identified and analyzed structural domains involved in vault assembly with emphasis on protein­ protein interactions. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we demonstrate within MVP an intramolecular binding site and show that MVP molecules interact with each other via their coiled coil domain. We show that purified MVP is able to bind calcium, most likely at calcium-binding EF-hands. No interactions could be detected between TEP1 and other vault proteins. However, the N-terminal half of MVP binds to a specific domain in the C-terminus of VPARP. Furthermore, VPARP contains amino acid stretches mediating intramolecular binding. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) Key Words: yeast two-hybrid system; calcium binding; MVP; VPARP; TEP1.

Vaults, large ribonucleoprotein particles, are predominantly found in the cytoplasm. However, part of the vaults may be associated with the nucleus or the nuclear membrane (1­3). The typical morphology of the complex is responsible for its name, since the hollow structure consists of multiple arches reminiscent of the vaulted ceilings in cathedrals (4). Although the cellular function of the vault complex is still unknown,

vault morphology and subcellular localization suggest a general role in intracellular transport. Studies in various organisms present data that support the concept of vaults as transport modules of some kind, although its cargo has not been characterized (1­3, 5­7). In recent years the vault complex has been linked to multidrug resistance in tumor cells (see for reviews: (8, 9). There is experimental evidence suggesting that at least part of the basis for vault-mediated drug resistance might lie in its ability to prevent nuclear accumulation of anthracyclins (10, 11). The 13 MDa mammalian vault structure is highly regular and consists of approximately 96 molecules of the 100 kDa major vault protein (MVP), 2 molecules of the 240 kDa minor vault protein TEP1, 8 molecules of the 193 kDa minor vault protein VPARP and at least 6 copies of a small untranslated RNA of 88 ­141 bases (12). The MVP molecules form the core of the complex, which is a barrel-like structure with an invaginated waist and two protruding caps. The complex can unfold into two symmetrical flower-like structures with 8 petals each supposedly consisting of 6 MVP molecules (13). TEP1 and probably VPARP are located in the two protruding caps (12, 14, 15). Vault RNA is associated with the TEP1 protein (12, 16, 17). In fact, using TEP1 / mouse embryonic fibroblasts it was shown that TEP1 is required for stable association of the vault RNA with the vault particle (17). Kong et al. (14) proposed that the WD40 repeats found in the C-terminal part of TEP1 determine the structure of the eight-fold symmetric vault particle. However, after examining vaults isolated from Tep1 / mice this proposal was abandoned when it was found that vault symmetry was preserved (17). Note that TEP1 is a shared protein with the telomerase complex, but it does not seem to be necessary for telomerase activity (16, 18). VPARP contains a distinct domain with similarity to the catalytic domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). It was demonstrated that VPARP catalyses ADP-ribosylation of itself and MVP, hence its name (19). Several addi0006-291X/02 $35.00

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS picked and screened for reporter gene activation by plating them on MY plates lacking trp, leu and his. The presence or absence of growth was assessed after three days at 30°C. The activity of the LacZ reporter was checked by a -galactosidase plate assay (24). The plates were routinely examined after 3 h of incubation at 30°C following the addition of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- -D-galactopyranoside (X-gal). The overall results are presented in tables with ` ' for interaction and ` ' for no interaction. To validate the results the AD and BD were exchanged in all situations. This sometimes led to discrepancies, which is a known phenomenon of the two-hybrid approach (25). Purification of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) MVP fusion proteins. A NcoI­EcoRV fragment of 2631 base pairs (encoding aa 1­ 871 of MVP) from pBSKSII-MVP was cloned between the NcoI and filled-in HindIII sites of the pGEX-KG polylinker (26). Likewise, a NcoI­SmaI fragment of 1264 base pairs (encoding aa 1­ 421 of MVP) was isolated and cloned between the NcoI and filled-in HindIII sites of the pGEX-KG polylinker. Both GST-MVP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli DH5 as described by Guan and Dixon (26). After harvesting, the cells were lysed by sonication in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, Roche, Mannheim, FRG). Subsequently, the soluble fusion proteins were bound to glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after which the MVP part was released by a thrombin digest. The fractions containing MVP were concentrated by freeze-drying. Calcium overlay assay. Proteins were subjected to SDS­PAGE (27) after which the size fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (28). A calcium overlay assay was performed essentially as described by Maruyama et al. (29). In brief: The nitrocellulose membranes were washed 2 times for 15 min with 10 mM imidazole pH 6.8, 60 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl. Then they were incubated for 10 min in the same buffer containing 1 Ci/ml of 45 CaCl 2 (specific activity 2 mCi/ml). After a 5-min wash with water the membranes were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) at 80°C. As a control, skeletal muscle tissue of BALB/c mice was used after homogenization by sonication in 25 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 containing 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 and a cocktail of protein inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

tional domains were identified, like a BRCT domain and a Von Willebrand factor type A domain within the Inter- -Inhibitor domain (19, 20). Interesting from a structural point of view is the region at the C-terminal end of VPARP (aa 1562­1724) that has been shown to interact with MVP (19). Despite the characterization of all vault components and the macromolecular assembly they form, very little is known about the biogenesis of the complex and the factors that mediate this process. To understand the formation of this highly ordered structure we identified and functionally characterized distinct structural domains present in the three vault proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacteria and yeast strains. Escherichia coli DH5 was the transformation recipient for all plasmids. For the two-hybrid screening the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was used. This strain was grown at 30°C in YPAD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 0.01% adenine, 2% glucose) or MY (0.12% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids and ammonium sulfate), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 1% succinic acid, 0.6% sodium hydroxide, 2% glucose) supplemented as required (0.01% ade, arg, cys, leu, lys, thr, trp, ura and 0.005% asp, his, ile, met, phe, pro, ser, tyr, val). For solid plates 2% agar was added. Yeast two-hybrid constructs. The yeast two-hybrid constructs were generated by cloning PCR amplified fragments of human MVP, VPARP and TEP1 into derivatives of pVP16 (pKNSD50-52; containing the transactivation domain, AD) and pBTM116 (pKNSD53-55; containing the Lex A DNA binding domain, BD) (21). The MVP cDNA fragments were derived from full-length cDNA cloned in pBSKSII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Fragments of VPARP were amplified by PCR using a cDNA clone, ha02779 (KIAA0177) (22). This construct lacks the first 276 bp of the VPARP ORF and bases 1024 and 1025 are deleted. To repair the VPARP ORF we cloned the first 1400 base pairs by RT-PCR. As a PCR template we used cDNA prepared from total RNA isolated from human mononuclear cells derived from peripheral blood. We introduced a KpnI restriction site at the 5 end (forward primer: 5 -GAggtaccATGGTGATGGGAATCTTTG) and made use of an AatII restriction site at the 3 end (reverse primer: 5 -TCCgacgtcTGTTCTTTGCACACC) of the fragment. The PCR product was isolated from gel, digested with KpnI and AatII and used to replace the KpnI­AatII fragment in ha02779. TEP1 fragments were amplified by PCR using pCR3-Myc-HuTEP1FL, which contains a myc-tagged full-length TEP1 cDNA insert. All primers were designed with 18 ­22 nucleotide anchors complementary to the sequence of interest, in addition to the appropriate restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes. In essence, PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for 5 min, then 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50 ­55°C for 2 min and 72°C for 2­5 min followed by 72°C for 8 min. The exact annealing temperatures depended on the T m values of the individual primer pairs. Routinely, Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or alternatively the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was used to prevent PCR artifacts. PCR products were isolated from gel and cloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and were subcloned into both two-hybrid vectors. The nucleotide sequences of all inserts, including the cloning junctions, were verified by cycle sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid analysis. The yeast strain L40 was transformed according to the LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG procedure (23) with different combinations of the pBTM116 and pVP16 plasmids containing MVP, VPARP and TEP1 inserts. Transformants were plated on MY plates lacking trp and leu. At least ten independent transformants were

RESULTS Coiled Coil Domain Mediates the Interaction between MVP Molecules The program COILS (http://www.ch.embnet.org/ software/COILS_form.html) identified a coiled coil conformation in the C-terminal half of MVP (aa 648 ­ 800). Since coiled coil structures may be involved in protein­ protein interactions, we focused on this particular domain of MVP. Next to the full-length MVP, N and C-terminal yeast two-hybrid constructs (MVP, MVPn and MVPc respectively), we prepared C-terminal deletion constructs sequentially removing the extreme C-terminal end but leaving the coiled coil intact (MVPcI), removing half of the coiled coil (MVPcII), deleting the complete coiled coil (MVPcIII) as well as a construct expressing only the coiled coil domain of MVP (MVPcIV) as is shown in Fig. 1. The results summarized in Table 1 indicate the existence of two distinct interaction sites of MVP, an intermolecular and intramolecular binding site. First, full-length MVP interacts with itself and with the C-terminal part, as

536

C-terminal part. Even partial or complete deletion of the coiled coil domain does not affect this interaction. This intramolecular binding must be formed between the N-terminal part and aa 448 ­ 651 of the C-terminal part and may be important for the secondary structure of each MVP molecule. In a full-length MVP molecule this interaction between MVPn and MVPc is already formed, which explains why full-length MVP does not interact with MVPn. MVP Contains EF-Hands Capable of Binding Calcium The MOTIF search service on Genome Net (Bioinformatics Center at Kyoto University, http://www.motif. genome.ad.jp) reveals the presence of a putative EFhand with the calcium-binding loop located at position 131­143. Careful analysis of the human MVP sequence revealed that this EF-hand is part of a degenerated repeat structure, which consists of five stretches of approximately 50 amino acids. In at least three repeats putative EF-hands could be distinguished (Fig. 2a). EF-hands are composed of two alpha helices, separated by a loop structure that consists of about 12 amino acids. In general, amino acid residues at position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 are involved in Ca 2 binding by coordinating the ion directly with their oxygen containing side chains. The oxygen at position 7 comes from the backbone and can be supplied by any amino acid (Table 2). Comparison of the EF-hand loops of MVP shows that only the first two loops match the criteria for genuine EF-hand, i.e., contain six amino acid residues that can interact with calcium. To test whether human MVP is capable of binding calcium we performed a calcium-binding overlay (Fig. 2b). The principle being that even in denatured conditions the EF-hands can bind calcium. We noticed that both MVP (aa 1­ 871) and the N-terminal half of MVP (aa 1­ 421) were able to bind calcium. However, consistently more calcium was bound to the N-terminal half resulting in a darker band on the autoradiograph. Possibly the EF-hands of MVP (aa 1­ 871) are masked by the C-terminal part of MVP. Note that equal amounts of protein were loaded. This means that about two times more MVPn molecules were loaded compared to MVP molecules. However, the difference in intensity between the bands is clearly more then two times. A mouse skeletal muscle lysate, known to contain calcium-binding proteins among which calmodulin of 14 kDa, was used as control (29). Two-Hybrid Analysis of VPARP and TEP1 The minor vault proteins VPARP and TEP1 contain several putative protein­protein interaction domains. Each of these domains could be involved in interactions with other vault components and hence contribute to the structural stability of the complex. As depicted in Fig. 1 we prepared several two-hybrid constructs either

FIG. 1. Yeast two-hybrid constructs. Plasmids encoding fusion proteins of a DNA-binding domain (BD) or a transactivation domain (AD) with complete vault proteins, or parts of them, were constructed. MVP fusion proteins included full-length MVP, the N-terminal part of MVP (MVPn; amino acid (aa) 1­ 447), the C-terminal part of MVP (MVPc; aa 448 ­ 893), aa 448 ­ 800 containing the complete coiled coil (MVPcI), aa 448 ­733 containing half of the coiled coil (MVPcII), aa 448 ­ 651 with no coiled coil (MVPcIII), and the coiled coil domain itself (MVPcIV; aa 652­ 800). VPARP fusion proteins included full-length VPARP, N-terminal part of VPARP (VPARPn; aa 1­ 862), C-terminal part of VPARP (VPARPc; aa 863­1724), BRCT domain (aa 1­94), Inter- -inhibitor domain (I I; aa 616 ­1195), Von Willebrand domain (vW; aa 878 ­987) and the MVP interaction domain (MVPint; aa 1562­1724). TEP1 fusion proteins included full-length TEP1, N-terminal part of TEP1 (TEPn; aa 1­1313), C-terminal part of TEP1 (TEPc; aa 1314 ­2627), four times repeat structure (4xR; aa 1­120) and the WD40 repeats (aa 1723­2410). Domains are indicated as follows: EF, EF-hand repeat structure; cc, coiled coil; BRCT, BRCT domain; I I, inter- -inhibitor domain; vW, Von Willebrand domain; MVPint, MVP interaction domain; 4xR, four times repeat structure and WD40, WD40 repeats.

shown in the first row and first column of Table 1. However, full-length MVP does not interact with the N-terminal part of MVP. It is clear that the interaction between full-length MVP and other parts of MVP can only be formed when the coiled coil domain is fully intact. When the coiled coil domain is deleted or partly deleted no interaction is possible. So, MVP interacts with itself via the coiled coil domain forming an intermolecular binding. Second, the second row and second column of Table 1 show that the N-terminal part of MVP does not interact with full-length MVP or with itself. Interestingly, this part does interact with the

We also included a construct expressing the extreme C-terminal amino acids of VPARP (aa 1562­1724; MVPint) that are supposed to interact with MVP (19). The constructs we generated of TEP1 either expressed the full-length TEP1, its N and C-terminal halves, the four repeats at the extreme

N-terminal end or the WD40 repeat region. Analysis of the protein fragments in the two-hybrid setting reveals an interaction between the N and C-terminal half of VPARP (Table 3). This must be an intramolecular binding site, since full-length VPARP does not interact with either of the two VPARP halves. The intramolecular interaction of VPARP is formed between aa 295­ 615 of the N-terminal part and aa 1197­1561 of the C-terminal part of VPARP. No interactions of this sort could be observed within TEP1 (data not shown). Furthermore, no intermolecular interactions were detected between two VPARP or between two TEP1 molecules. Expression of the full-length VPARP gave rise to false activation of the reporter genes when expressed in the DNA binding domain vector (these results are indicated by dots in the table). This phenomenon was also observed when this plasmid was transformed to yeast without an activating domain construct (data not shown). Interactions between MVP, VPARP and TEP1 to Make Up the Vault Complex We tested all combinations of MVP, VPARP and TEP1 two-hybrid constructs with the exception of the MVP coiled coil constructs (MVPcI­IV). Only fulllength VPARP and its C-terminal half were capable of interacting with MVP (Table 3). This interaction appears to be mediated by the previously identified MVP interaction domain (aa 1562­1724) of VPARP (19). Our results show that the N-terminal half of MVP is involved in this interaction. Surprisingly no interaction could be detected between TEP1 and the VPARP or MVP fragments (data not shown).

system. First, two intramolecular interactions could be found between the two halves of MVP and the two halves of VPARP (Fig. 3, numbers 1 and 2). Second, we identified the coiled coil domain as being responsible for the linking of at least two and possibly six MVP molecules forming a MVP-MVP unit (Fig. 3, number 3). This unit probably forms the basis for each of the vault petals. Third, we confirmed earlier reports in which an interaction was described between VPARP and MVP. Our result show that this interaction is specifically mediated by the N-terminal part of MVP (Fig. 3, number 4). DISCUSSION Vaults, the largest ribonucleoprotein particles known to date, were first described more than 15 years ago (4). Since then the individual vault components were identified, characterized and a high-resolution three-dimensional model of the complete vault complex was generated. However, little is known about the assembly of vault proteins into vault particles and the factors that mediate this process. In this study we identified

and analyzed distinct structural domains within the vault proteins and in particular the ones involved in protein­protein interactions. The program COILS predicts the presence of a coiled coil domain in the C-terminal half of all MVP molecules described to date. Our data clearly demonstrate that MVP molecules interact with each other via their coiled coil domain forming MVP-MVP units. Apparently the coiled coil structure of MVP is the main determinant for the vault structure. Interesting in this respect is the MVP sequence of Ictalurus punctatus (GenBank Accession No. AF255664), which with a length of 549 amino acids is about 300 amino acids shorter than other MVP sequences in the database. However, alignment of the various MVP molecules reveals that the I. punctatus MVP contains a specific insertion of 32 amino acids (aa 350 ­381) that is identified as a coiled coil structure. Recently it was found that expression of rat MVP in vault-less Sf9 insect cells results in the formation of vault-like particles, independent of the presence of the two minor vault proteins and vault RNA (30). This observation emphases the importance of the coiled coil domain in MVP molecules

FIG. 3. Schematic view of the mapped protein­protein interactions within and between vault proteins. All interactions that were identified and mapped by means of the yeast two-hybrid system are depicted. 1, an intramolecular binding was identified between the N-terminal part (aa 1­ 447) and the C-terminal part (aa 448 ­ 651) of MVP. 2, an intramolecular binding site was identified for VPARP between the N-terminal part (aa 295­ 615) and the C-terminal part (aa 1197­1561). 3, MVP molecules interact with each other via their coiled coil domains (cc, aa 652­ 800). 4, there is an interaction between VPARP (MVPint, aa 1562­1724) and the N-terminal part of MVP.

for the assembly of the total vault complex independent of the other vault proteins. Next to the coiled coil structure, MVP was found to contain three putative EF-hands in an N-terminal repeat structure. The EF-hand motif consists of approximately 40 amino acids arranged in a helix-loop-helix conformation with calcium ion binding in the loop region. The calcium-binding loops of the first two EFhands of MVP are quite similar to 165 other EF-hand loops (31), but the third EF-hand loop diverged from the consensus sequence. If we consider the flanking regions of the EF-hand loops, the second EF-hand of MVP resembles most closely a classic EF-hand, whereas the first has an extra insertion between the two -helices (data not shown). We discovered that full-length MVP indeed could bind calcium, however more calcium was bound to the N-terminal half of MVP. A possible explanation for this observation might be that the EF-hands of full-length MVP are partly shielded by the C-terminal part of the protein, via the identified interaction between the N and C-terminal halves of MVP. The precise function of calcium binding for the vault complex is not known, but preliminary experiments are pointing to a role of calcium in the folding and assembly of MVP molecules into complete vault particles. Interestingly, particles with vault-like properties were formed after renaturation of guanidinium-HCl denaturated purified MVP. This was only

the case when calcium was added to the renaturation buffer (data not shown). When we analyzed the minor vault protein constructs in our yeast two-hybrid setting, we found an interaction between the N-terminal part of MVP and aa 1564 ­1724 of VPARP, which was previously identified as the MVP interaction domain of VPARP (19). Apparently, in the intact vault complex the C-terminal part of MVP is bound to itself, leaving the N-terminal part accessible for VPARP binding. Furthermore, we found an interaction within the VPARP protein and located this intramolecular interaction between aa 295­ 615 of the N-terminal part and 1197­1561 of the C-terminal part. We did not find any interaction between TEP1 and the other vault proteins. Even when human vault RNA (hvg1 under control of a polymerase III promoter) was coexpressed in the yeast system, no interactions were found between TEP1/hvg1 and the other vault proteins (data not shown). This may indicate that the association of TEP1 to vaults needs a combination of vault proteins and/or other proteins. It was suggested that the repeat structure at the N-terminus of TEP1 would interact with VPARP (12). However, this was not the case in our two-hybrid screen. In this study we found several domains that did not appear to be involved in the formation of vaults, e.g., BRCT and WD40 domains. The minor vault proteins, VPARP and TEP1, may need these structural domains to function elsewhere in the cell. For instance, certain domains of TEP1 may only be functional within the telomerase complex. Similarly, the VPARP protein that is also localized in the nucleus may need domains to perform separate functions there (19). Nevertheless, these domains may also play a role within the vault complex, like the binding of possible substrates for VPARP and/or the uptake of putative vault cargo. The identification of such a cargo or substrate may help to clarify the function of the vault complex. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
