Abstract
Molecular analogs of amino acids can be incorporated into proteins. The amino acid analog selenomethionine (SeMet) has been shown to be efficiently incorporated into the proteins of growing Escherichiu coli. SeMet-containing proteins are known to produce sufficiently strong anomalous scatter permitting the solution of the selenomethionyl crystal structure by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) techniques. The recombinant protein chosen for these studies is mature, truncated neutrophil collagenase (rmNC-t). The rmNC-t protein is a monomer of 163 amino acid residues featuring one active site and two Met residues. We developed a T7 polymerase expression system allowing incorporation of SeMet into rmNC-t protein produced in E. coli. Substitution of Met with SeMet was accomplished by culturing E. cofi DL41(DE3), a SeMet-tolerant strain with metA lesion, in a defined medium containing SeMet as the sole source of Met. The SeMet-labeled rmNC-t was isolated from inclusion bodies by solubilizing in urea, purified by anion column chromatography, and then refolded in the presence of Ca2+ and Zn*+. Analysis of SeMet-labeled rmNC-t demonstrated that Met replacement was 100%. Enzymatic characterization revealed no obvious differences in activity or inhibitor binding between rmNC-t and the SeMet-labeled product. We have produced pure, active SeMet-labeled rmNC-t in sufficient quantities for macromolecular crystallography studies. Keywords:

est are structural analogs of some essential metabolites. The effect of amino acid analogs on growth and protein synthesis in microorganisms was an intense area of research in the 19.50s (Fowden et al., 1967). The analogs substitute for the corresponding, naturally occurring amino acid. In general, the analog causes cellular growth to become linear with time and specific enzymatic activity may be lost (Cowie et al., 1959). Cowie and Cohen (1957) showed that exponential growth is obtained with the selenium analog of methionine (Met), selenomethionine (SeMet), using a Met requiring mutant of Escherichia coli. More importantly, these researchers demonstrated that the auxotroph can synthesize active proteins in the complete absence of Met. Apparently, SeMet is capable of replacing Met with little disturbance of normal growth and division. The E. co/i culture has the capacity to grow for 100 generations with a doubling time of 75 min in the presence of SeMet. For macromolecular crystallography purposes, systematic biological incorporation of SeMet in place of Met residues in proteins offers a heavy atom derivative readily available for crystallization trials. Furthermore, the method of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) techniques can be exploited to solve the selenomethionyl crystal structure. Utilizing this technique, Hendrickson and coworkers have solved the structure of several SeMet-containing proteins (Hendrickson et al., 1990; Graves et al., 1990; Yang et al., 1990; Leahy et al., 1992). An additional benefit of Se presence in proteins is that they can be studied by "Se nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, since the "Se isotope exhibits properties which make it an attractive NMR probe (Dunlap and Odom, 1988; Boles et al., 1992). The published biochemical data on SeMetcontaining enzymes have focused on prokaryotic proteins, mainly those of E. co/i, e.g., P-galactosidase, thymidylate synthase, and dihydrofolate reductase (Boles et al., 1991, 1992). To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature which compare biochemical properties of native eukaryotic proteins and their SeMet homologues. We wanted to provide an example of the effects

of the complete replacement of Met with SeMet on an eukaryotic enzyme. We have chosen the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) human neutrophil collagenase (HNC) for this investigation. The MMPs are being targeted for drug development by several pharmaceutical companies. HNC has been implicated in the pathology associated with rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis because of articular cartilage tissue degradation. In these studies, we intended to: (1) examine the comparative biochemistry of Met vs. SeMet of the recombinant mature neutrophil collagenase with a C-terminal truncation (rmNC-t) produced in E. coZi, and (2) explore the behavior of SeMet-containing rmNC-t in crystallization experiments. To this end, we developed a T7 polymerase directed expression system allowing recombinant selenomethionyl proteins to be produced in an E. coli Met auxotroph. This is the first report on a T7-promoter/SeMet expression system with high protein yields. In addition, a defined medium was optimized for growth and production of SeMet-containing proteins. This work represents the first observation of a selenoHNC enzyme resulting from biosynthetically substituted Met residues with SeMet into the protein.

Expression plasmid construction

The short form of HNC (mNC-t) was amplified by PCR from pGEX-2T/hnc plasmid bearing the complete cDNA. The sense primer was 5 CTCCATATGTTAACCCCAGGAAACCCC 3 which incorporates an NdeI site at its 5'-end. The antisense primer was 5' CCTCGGATCCTCATCATCCATAGATGGCCTG AATGCC 3' which carries a BamHI site and two TGA stop codons in tandem at its end. The PCR product of a 489 bp was cloned into the pETlla unique sites NdeI/BamHI (Studier et al., 1990). The plasmid was designated pWQ110. This construct expresses the HNC catalytic domain, an 18 kDa protein, beginning with Met,, and ending with GlY*,** The Gly,,,-Leu 263 junction, a naturally existing autolytic site, marks the approximate border between the catalytic domain and hemopexin-like domain.

Protein gels and westerns were performed to monitor protein expression and purification. Samples were analyzed on precast lo-20% gradient sepragels (ISS, Hyde Park, MA) run according to manufacturer's instruction. Immunoblotting was essentially as described by Towbin et al. (1979) using a polyclonal antibody raised against human fibroblast collagenase (HFC; BirkedalHansen et al., 19881. Blots were treated with a secondary antibody, an alkaline phosphatase conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG, and developed with BCIP/NBT (Mierendorf et al., 1987).
Amino acid sequencing

The dideoxy method according to Sanger et al. (1977) was used employing double-stranded plasmid DNA and the Sequanasea kit version 2.0 as described elsewhere (Kraft et al., 1988). A 28-mer extending from the vector Bgf II site into the gene and a 26-mer near the EcoRV site in the middle of the HNC gene were used to carry out the sequencing protocol.
E. coli strains and culture conditions

The Se-tolerant bacterial strain DL41 (F-, A-,

Alternatively, the protein sample was run on SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) and electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (BioRad, Richmond, CA). The Coomassie-stained band(s) were excised and sequenced with the Millipore's Prosequencer @instrument (Matsudaira, 1987).

Bacteria transformed with pWQll0 were grown at 37°C in defined LeMaster medium devoid of methionine (LeMaster and Richards, 1985, LeMaster and Richards, 1988) in the presence of 100 pg ml-' ampicillin. This medium was modified by adding Kao and Michayluk vitamin solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) trace metal mix, and increasing glucose concentration to 0.2%. The enriched LeMaster medium contained Lselenomethionine (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA) to a final concentration of 25 pg ml-`. When

Aliquots equivalent to 4 nmol of each of the protein samples were dried in hydrolysis tubes and subjected to hydrolysis in 6 N HCl under argon atmosphere at 110°C for 24 h. The hydrolysates were suspended in 100 ~1 of citrate buffer pH 2.2. Injections of 40 ~1 were made on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer equipped with lithium cation exchange column and ninhydrin detection (Spa&man et al., 1958).
Atomic emission spectroscopy

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy technique (ICP-AES) was utilized to measure Se content in samples. This analytical

method is based on detection of emitted light from the element of interest once the sample is vaporized, ionized, and excited by the argon plasma. A 20 nmol sample was introduced into the cross-flow nebulizer. Measurements were determined on a JY/ISA 38 ICP System as recommended by the manufacturer.

The procedure adopted for on-line separation, using a micro capillary HPLC system coupled to an electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometer, has been described in detail elsewhere (Eshraghi and Chowdhury, 1993). Briefly, the gradient mobile phases (0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) from the Waters 600 HPLC pump (typically 200-400 11 min-`I is split with a ratio of 1OO:l. The smaller fraction passes through a 0.5 ~1 injection loop followedOby a micro capillary column (Vydac C-18, 300 A; 300 Km i.d. x 15 cm) to first to the detection cell of a Spectroflow UV detector and then to the ES1 chamber of a Finnigan TSQ 700 mass spectrometer, while the larger fraction goes to the waste. The UV detector and the ES1 mass spectrometer are operated in series so that measurement of the UV chromatogram and the mass spectra can be performed on the same effluent.

helper phage (int', c1_ ), and B482 selection phage, which can neither integrate into c1 susceptible cells nor kill DE3 lysogens because of the same immunity. The hDE3 phage carries the T7 polymerase gene under the ZacUV5 promoter control. Thus, a lysogenized host can be used to express target genes cloned in the PET vector series under the control of the T7 promoter. Lysogens were verified by a T7 deletion mutant, 4107 phage, that is completely defective unless active T7 polymerase is provided by host. A tightly regulated basal level T7 polymerase expression lysogen was selected and designated E. coli Q41. Then we examined mNC-t expression from pWQll0 in this constructed strain. Levels of protein expression were evaluated in both a rich medium (terrific broth) and a chemically defined methionine proficient medium (LeMaster medium). A typical result of this experiment is shown in Fig. 1. No basal level of mNC-t was detected in culture, indicating that the selected lysogen exhibited a tight T7 polymerase regulation (lanes 2 and 6). The rmNC-t was expressed efficiently in both media to high levels (lanes 3, 4 and 7-9). Overexpression was measured by densitometry scanning of SDS-PAGE gels. This assessment revealed that protein expression as expected was higher in rich medium than in defined medium 30% and 15% of total bacterial protein, respectively. 3.2. Optimization of culture conditions The medium described by LeMaster and Richards (1985, 1988) gives mNC-t levels approaching 15% of total bacterial protein. When DL-SeMet is substituted for L-Met, protein levels were typically 5-7%. Additionally, a lengthy lag phase extending to 12 h is observed with this medium. In order to improve growth and protein yield, the SeMet-containing medium was modified by doubling the amount of amino acids, nucleotides, glucose, succinic acid and ammonium chloride. Also, we supplemented the medium with a mix of heavy metals and vitamins. Finally, the modified medium was filter sterilized instead of being autoclaved. The inoculum size was 1% (v/v) this leads to only 0.5% residues of

Methods for purifying truncated MMPs have been detailed elsewhere (Moore and Spilburg, 1986; Ye et al., 1992; Schnierer et al., 1993; Ho et al., 1994).

The modifications diminished the extended lag phase to 4 h which is now characteristic of the growth curve in the newly formulated SeMet medium.

High levels of SeMet-rmNCt protein was produced after l-3 h of induction (Fig. 3A, lanes 3-5). Expression levels approached 20% of total bacterial protein. No protein production was observed without IPTG addition. The SeMet-rmNCt (18 kDa band) routinely accumulated in inclusion bodies (data not shown). Western immunoblotting was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against HFC (Fig. 3B). Western analysis showed that HFC antibody is cross-reactive with SeMet substituted HNC (lanes 3-5). When the presumptive SeMetrmNCt band was subjected to amino acid sequence analysis no stable Edman degradation product was present after cycle 1, but the remainder of the sequence analyzed (60 cycles) was identical to that for the wild-type rmNC-t. These results not only demonstrated that Met did not exist at position 1 in SeMet-rmNCt, but also supported the presence of SeMet at this site, since the PTH derivative of SeMet was found to be unstable (data not shown).

Purification

Methods for purifying truncated MMPs have been detailed elsewhere (Schnierer et al., 1993; Ye et al., 1992). We have adapted these methods for purification of truncated HNCs (Ho et al., 1994). Here, we extend the application of this modified procedure to SeMet-rmNCt purification. Briefly, inclusion bodies were recovered from lysed bacteria (Marcy et al., 1991). The pellet was solubilized in 6 M urea and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a MonoQ-Sepharose column (Fig. 4A). Pooled fractions were diluted lo-fold and renaturation was performed with a refolding buffer containing Zn" and Ca*+ at 4°C. After the protein was concentrated, a final step of purification was carried out on a Sepharcyl S-100 HR column (Fig. 4Bl. Minor impurities detected on SDS-PAGE gels were attributed to the degradation of the recombinant protein based on amino acid sequencing. This protocol yielded highly purified SeMet-rmNCt (20 mg l- `1 suitable for mechanistic studies of cataly-

sis and inhibition (see below). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of rmNC-t confirmed that it corresponded to mature HNCs. We then utilized hydroxamate sepharose chromatography (Moore and Spilburg, 19861, following refolding of the recombinant protein, for further purification. In this step, the metalloenzyme coordinates to the affinity ligand permitting rapid purification. Full-length SeMet-rmNCt was separated from degradation products and other contaminants (Fig. 4C, lane 3; 18-kDa band), yielding a pure, active, rmNC-t which could be concentrated without autodegradation (Fig. 4C, lane 4). Small peptide impurities (less than 10000 in molecular weight) which appeared after affinity purification were removed during concentration. The identity of the protein was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing.

SeMet-labeled protein is expected to possess two selenium atoms. Three different approaches were utilized to confirm SeMet-labeling of the recombinant protein. These experiments were conducted in duplicate from two separate batches with unlabeled rmNC-t as a control. First, the level of SeMet substitution in the purified protein was estimated by amino acid composition analyses. SeMet decomposes under the acid hydrolysis conditions used in the analysis, and thus it is the absence of Met that is monitered. Samples analyzed under overloaded conditions indicated that > 95% SeMet incorporation in the protein. Second, the number of Se atoms in the purified protein was determined by ICP-AES. This analy-

sis detected 1.9 Se per mol protein. Finally, LCMS was used to provide precise measurement of the molecular weight of the labeled-recombinant protein. The on-line chromatogram (upper panel) and the mass spectrum (bottom panel) corresponding to the later eluting peak at scan No. 1600 of SeMet-containing rmNCt sample are shown in Fig. 5. The mass spectrum showed a number of ions arising from the attachment of a different number of protons to the protein molecules, which is typical of electrospray ionization (ES11 mass spectra of proteins (Fenn et al., 1990; Smith et al., 1991). Each of these ion peaks provides an independent measurement of the molecular weight of the protein. The molecular

weight measured from this and three separate LC/ESI-MS experiments gave an average molecular weight of 18 195 f 10. This value agreed with the one calculated (18191) for rmNC-t corresponding to the replacement of two Met with SeMet. The mass spectrometric measurements thus support the incorporation of two SeMet in rmNC-t and indicate the absence of N-terminal heterogeneity. It should be noted that the molecular weight of rmNC-t without SeMet is only 18097. The peptides in the early eluting region of the UV chromatogram (Fig. 5, upper panel) have not been identified although their molecular weights are recorded. Enzymatic characterization Enzyme activity and kinetic parameters were determined by assays based on the hydrolysis of small peptide substrates as described previously (Stack and Gray, 1989; Knight et al., 1992). Using the pentapeptide benzoyl-PLALW-NH-(CH,),N-(CH,), as a substrate in a fluorimetric assay in a microtiter plate (R.C. Wahl, unpublished data), rmNC-t and SeMet-rmNCt had a specific activity of 1.58 f 0.08 and 1.11 pmol product per pg protein per h, respectively. The K, and k,,,/K, values obtained were 63.5 + 9.2 PM and 30.4 &respectively. The activity of 2.2 PM-' h-`, rmNC-t and SeMet-rmNCt were inhibited by ion

chealators such as 5 mM EDTA and 10 mM l,lO-phenanthroline. The inhibitor actinonin (hydroxamate functionality, Wahl et al., 1989) displayed a measured Ki of 160 f 10 with rmNC-t and 150 f nM with SeMet-rmNCt. The native NC isolated from human blood has comparable kinetic (Mallya et al., 1990; Netzel-Arnett et al., 1991) and Ki values (Wahl et al., 1989).

4. Conclusions (1) The coding region for mNC-t was amplified by PCR, sub-cloned and expressed in E. coli utilizing the inducible T7 polymerase PET system. (2) We constructed a Se-tolerant E. coli strain that is compatible with T7 expression system. (3) We developed and optimized a defined medium/culture conditions for SeMet substitution. (4) We expressed and demonstrated incorporation of SeMet into rmNC-t where we achieved 100% replacement of Met with SeMet.
