ABSTRACT: S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is a key enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition of this pathway and subsequent depletion of polyamine levels is a viable strategy for cancer chemotherapy and for the treatment of parasitic diseases. Substrate analogue inhibitors display an absolute requirement for a positive charge at the position equivalent to the sulfonium of S-adenosylmethionine. We investigated the ligand specificity of AdoMetDC through crystallography, quantum chemical calculations, and stopped-flow experiments. We determined crystal structures of the enzyme cocrystallized with 50 -deoxy-50 -dimethylthioadenosine and 50 -deoxy-50 -(N-dimethyl)amino-8-methyladenosine. The crystal structures revealed a favorable cation- interaction between the ligand and the aromatic side chains of Phe7 and Phe223. The estimated stabilization from this interaction is 4.5 kcal/mol as determined by quantum chemical calculations. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments showed that the rate of the substrate binding to the enzyme greatly depends on Phe7 and Phe223, thus supporting the importance of the cation- interaction.

The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are aliphatic polycations that are critical for maintaining cell differentiation and proliferation (1-3). Elevated levels of polyamines are found in cancerous and tumor cell lines (4, 5). Thus, depleting polyamine levels by inhibition of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway is a promising approach for the treatment and prevention of cancer and also for the treatment of various parasitic diseases. S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC)1 is a key enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway

and depends on a pyruvoyl cofactor for the decarboxylation reaction (6-9). AdoMetDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to S-adenosyl-50 -(3-methylthiopropylamine) (dcAdoMet). The aminopropyl group from dcAdoMet is transferred to putrescine or spermidine to form spermidine or spermine, respectively. AdoMetDC catalyzes an early step in the pathway, and dcAdoMet is completely committed to polyamine biosynthesis; thus, AdoMetDC is an attractive target for drug design. The early inhibitors of AdoMetDC included the potent competitive inhibitor methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) (10). Clinical studies on this compound were hampered by an unexpected mitochondrial toxicity unrelated to its inhibition of AdoMetDC. An MGBG analogue, 4-amidinoindan-1-one-20 -amidinohydrazone (CGP48664A), showed promise in multiple phase I and phase II clinical trials (11-18). Irreversible (or slowly reversible) substrate analogue inhibitors, which form a Schiff base with the active site pyruvoyl group, have also been synthesized but are limited by their nonspecific activity toward cellular aldehydes and ketones (19). In vitro assays showed that a positive charge at the position of the sulfonium ion substrate analogues is essential for ligand binding and inhibition (20). Thioether and sulfoxide substrate analogues, which lack the positive charge, exhibited no activity. On the other hand, replacement of a sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom, which is protonated at physiological pH and retains the positive charge, resulted in AdoMetDC inhibition. This is consistent with the observation that S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is not a substrate for AdoMetDC (21).

Bale et al. the protein were pooled, concentrated to 10 mg/mL, and stored at -80 °C. The construction, expression, and purification of the mutants were described previously (22, 23). Crystallization. The protein was buffer exchanged into 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT using Bio-Rad buffer exchange chromatography columns. The protein was incubated separately with a 4-6-fold molar excess of MMTA and DMAMA for 24 h prior to crystallization. The crystals were grown using the hanging drop method at 22 °C in 13-16% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (pH 8.0-9.0), and 10 mM DTT. Crystals appeared overnight and were stable for 1-2 weeks but deteriorated thereafter. Data Collection and Processing. The crystals were sequentially transferred to solutions containing the well solution with 2, 5, 8, 15, and 18% glycerol with equilibration for 1-2 min between each step. The crystals were flash-frozen under liquid nitrogen before being placed in the liquid nitrogen stream. The data for the complex of AdoMetDC with MMTA were collected at NE-CAT beamline 8-BM at the Advanced Photon Source using an ADSC Quantum 315 detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). Data were collected over a rotation range of 200° with an oscillation range of 1° and a 60 s exposure per frame with a detector to crystal distance of 320 mm. The data for the complex of DMAMA were collected on NE-CAT beamline 24-ID-C. Data were collected over a rotation range of 200° with an oscillation range of 1° and 1 s exposure per frame with a detector to crystal distance of 250 mm. The data for the complexes were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (24). The data collection statistics for both complexes are summarized in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement. The structures of the complexes were determined by molecular replacement with CNS (25) using the structure of the AdoMetDC-MeAdoMet complex [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1i7B] as the search model. Model building for the complex of MMTA was performed using O (26). The model building for the complex of DMAMA was performed using Coot (27). The initial model obtained from molecular replacement was adjusted using composite omit maps and refined using successive rounds of simulated annealing, minimization, B-factor refinement, generation of new composite omit maps, difference Fourier maps, and model building. After a few rounds of refinement, the positions and conformations of the ligand molecules were identified using the improved difference Fourier maps and composite omit maps. The ligands were included in the models, and water molecules were added on the basis of the peaks in the difference Fourier maps. The parameter and the topology files for the ligands were generated using the HIC-Up server (28). The difference maps also showed density for a molecule of putrescine bound in each of the structures. The final refinement statistics for both complexes are given in Table 2. Quantum Mechanical Calculations. The quantum chemical calculations on the cation- interactions were performed using Jaguar version 6.0 or 6.5 (Schrdinger). The X-ray o structure of MMTA bound to AdoMetDC was employed for these calculations, and single-point energy calculations were performed using the LMP2/6-31G** method on the following: (CH3)3S+ (from MMTA) plus two benzene rings (from Phe7 and Phe223), (CH3)3S+ (from MMTA) plus one benzene ring (from Phe223), (CH3)3S+ (from MMTA) plus one benzene ring (from Phe7), (CH3)3S+ alone, benzene alone, (CH3)2S (from MMTA)

Previously, the structures of AdoMetDC and its complexes with inhibitors 50 -deoxy-50 -[N-methyl-N-(3-hydrazinopropyl) amino]adenosine (MHZPA), 50 -deoxy-50 -{N-methyl-N-[(2-aminooxy)ethyl]amino}adenosine (MAOEA), the methyl ester of AdoMet (MeAdoMet), MGBG, and CGP48664A were determined (22). MGBG and CGP48664A act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme and stack between Phe7 and Phe223 and form hydrogen bonds with Glu247, Ser229, and the backbone amide of Leu65. The substrate analogues MHZPA, MAOEA, and MeAdoMet have positive charges at the sulfonium ion position and covalently bind to the enzyme acting as slowly reversible inhibitors. The adenine base of these inhibitors stacks between Phe7 and Phe223; the glycosidic bond adopts an unusual syn conformation, and both ribose hydroxyl groups hydrogen bond to Glu247. The requirement for a positive charge in substrate analogues remained puzzling because no negatively charged amino acid side chain was located nearby. We chose to investigate the basis of the ligand specificity of AdoMetDC using crystallography, quantum chemical calculations, and stopped-flow kinetic experiments. We determined crystal structures of the enzyme cocrystallized with 50 -deoxy-50 (dimethylsulfonio)adenosine (MMTA) and 50 -deoxy-50 -(N-dimethyl)amino-8-methyladenosine (DMAMA). The energy difference between the syn and anti conformations of the ligands in solution and in the active site of the enzyme was obtained using quantum chemical calculations. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments were conducted to investigate the importance of Phe7 and Phe223, two residues located near the positive charge. Our results show that ligand specificity in human AdoMetDC is mainly due to cation- interactions and to electrostatic interactions between N3 of adenine and the sulfonium ion, which stabilizes the syn conformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. The syntheses of MMTA and DMAMA were previously reported (23), and the compounds were gifts from J. Secrist at Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL). Protein Expression and Purification. The gene encoding AdoMetDC was cloned into a pQE30 vector and transformed into JM109 Escherichia coli cells. Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 mg/mL ampicillin at 37 °C until the absorbance reached an OD600 of 0.6, at which point the cells were induced with 100 mg/L isopropyl 1--D-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was reduced to 15 °C. The cells were allowed to grow overnight before being harvested by centrifugation, washed using a lysis buffer containing 20 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0), 500 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM putrescine, 0.02% polyoxyethylene glycol dodecyl ether (Brij-35), and 10 mM imidazole, and stored at -80 °C. The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and lysed using a French press at 1500 psi. The cellular debris was separated from the lysate by centrifugation at 12000g. The cell lysate was incubated with Talon metal affinity resin for 1.5 h. The protein-resin complex was packed into a column and washed with 15-20 column volumes of wash buffer, which is the lysis buffer supplemented with 25 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with the wash buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. The elute was further purified through a Superdex 75 column using a buffer containing 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N0 -2ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.5), 2.5 mM putrescine, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.02% Brij-35, and 300 mM NaCl.

perturbation (LMP2)/cc-PVTZ(-f) method with aqueous selfconsistent reaction field (SCRF) solvation. The energies of the syn and anti conformations of MMTA in complex with the enzyme were determined using the MMTA complex as the basis. The truncated model for the syn conformation consisted of MMTA and residues Phe223 and Phe7. Backbone atoms of the adjacent residues were also included in the calculations. In addition, an acetate moiety derived from Glu247 was included. Hydrogen atoms were added to the model. Constrained geometry optimization was performed at the Hartree-Fock (HF)/6-31G** level, and the single-point energy was then calculated at the LMP2//6-31G** level. All atoms were constrained during the geometry optimization except the adenine ring, the ribose C10 atom, and the ribose hydroxyl groups. The anti conformation was generated from this truncated model by adjusting the O-C10 -N9-C4 torsion angle to -140° followed by geometry optimization as described above. The partial charges after geometry optimization were obtained for each atom. Stopped-Flow Experiments. The stopped-flow experiments were performed using a KinTek Stopped-Flow apparatus (model SF-2004, KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Experiments were conducted at 25 °C in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. The time dependence of binding was measured by monitoring changes in the intrinsic protein fluorescence. An excitation wavelength of 298 nm (rather than the excitation maximum of 280 nm) was used to avoid problems associated with inner filtering caused by increasing the ligand concentration. Emission was observed using a band-pass filter centered at 340 nm ((10 nm). All reported concentrations refer to the final value after rapid mixing of the ligand with enzyme at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v). The final enzyme concentration was 25 M for the WT protein and the F7A and E247A mutants and 100 M for the F223A mutant. AdoMet was mixed with enzyme in an at least 4-fold excess to maintain pseudo-first-order conditions. Linear and nonlinear regression of the data were performed using GraFit 5 (Erithacus Software, Horley, Surrey, U.K.). Figure Preparation. Structural figures were generated using PyMOL (31). RESULTS Cocrystallization of AdoMetDC with Ligands. The enzyme was cocrystallized in the presence of SAH, MMTA, DMAMA, and MTA. The crystallization experiments show that only MMTA and DMAMA bound to the enzyme in the crystal while MTA and SAH did not. Cocrystallization experiments with MTA and SAH were performed at increased concentrations and incubation times to increase the likelihood of binding at the active site; however, no active site density was observed. Crystal Structure of AdoMetDC with MMTA. The overall fold of AdoMetDC is a four-layer RR sandwich as previously described (32). AdoMetDC autoprocessing results in an R-subunit with an N-terminal pyruvoyl group and a smaller -subunit (32, 33). One molecule of putrescine is bound between the -sheets for each ° monomer and is located 15-20 A from the active site. In the crystal structure of AdoMetDC with MMTA, loops containing residues 1-4, 22-26, 165-172, 288-299, and 328334 were disordered and were excluded from the model. MMTA ribose forms hydrogen bonds to Glu247; the O20 -O2 distance is ° ° 3.2 A, and the O30 -O1 distance is 2.7 A. The sulfonium sulfur ° atom is 4.4 A from the center of the Phe233 ring, and the closest ° contact of sulfur atom with Phe223 is 3.9 A (C1). The methylene

The energies and conformations of MMTA and 50 -deoxy-50 methylthioadenosine (MTA) in solution were determined starting with the NMR structure of AdoMet in solution (30) and truncating the molecule to MMTA or MTA. The syn conformation was obtained by adjusting the O-C10 -N9-C4 torsion angle. The structures were subjected to geometry optimization using the B3LYP/6-31G* density functional method and the SCRF implicit aqueous solvation model available in Jaguar. The single-point energy of the geometry-optimized structures was then obtained using the local Moller-Plesset second-order

Bale et al. to yield the observed rates (1 and 2) and amplitudes (A1 and A2) of the two phases at each concentration of AdoMet. The concentration dependencies of the fast and slow phases are plotted in Figure 3. The fast phase exhibited a linear concentration dependence and did not saturate. The slow phase was approximately hyperbolic and saturated at relatively low concentrations. The data are best described by a minimal model of two sequential steps: E þ S T EX T EA

° carbon atom adjacent to the sulfonium ion of MMTA is 4.4 A ° from C2 of Phe7. The from the center of Phe7 and 3.6 A glycosidic bond of MMTA adopts a syn conformation, and the adenine ring stacks between Phe223 and Phe7. The stereoview of the electron density for MMTA in the active site is shown in Figure 1. Crystal Structure of AdoMetDC with DMAMA. In the structure of AdoMetDC with DMAMA, the loops containing residues 1-3, 24-26, 165-173, 288-299, and 328-334 were missing in the crystal structure. The ribose makes two hydrogen ° bonds to Glu247 with the O20 -O2 distance being 2.9 A and the 0 ° . The nitrogen is 4.7 A from the ° O3 -O1 distance being 2.6 A ° center of Phe223 and 4.2 A from C1 of Phe223. The methylene ° carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen atom is 4.3 A from the ° from C2 of Phe7. The adenosine moiety center of Phe7 and 3.7 A of DMAMA is in a syn conformation with the adenine base stacking between Phe7 and Phe223. A stereoview of the electron density for DMAMA in the active site is shown in Figure 2. Quantum Mechanical Calculations. The LMP2/6-31G** energies from the quantum mechanical calculations are listed in Table 3. The calculated gas phase binding energy of (CH3)3S+ between two benzene rings in the same geometrical orientations as Phe7 and Phe223 is -5.09 kcal/mol. On the other hand, the binding energy of (CH3)2S between two benzene rings in the same geometrical orientations as Phe7 and Phe223 is only -0.60 kcal/mol. These calculations suggest that the cation- interaction provides an additional stabilization of approximately -4.5 kcal/mol. Similar calculations suggest that the energy for binding of (CH3)3S+ to Phe223 is -3.15 kcal/mol and the energy for binding to Phe7 is -3.41 kcal/mol. The ab inito energy of the syn conformation of MMTA in the complex with Phe223, Phe7, and Glu247 is -3039.28899965619 hartrees, and the energy of the anti conformation is 3039.26998403002 hartrees. Thus, the energy difference between the syn and anti conformations of MMTA in the active site is -11.93 kcal/mol, favoring the syn conformation. This would represent the stabilization of the syn conformation caused primarily by Phe223 and Phe7. We also investigated the conformational energetics of MMTA and MTA in aqueous solution using quantum chemical calculations. The results are in agreement with the experimental results described by Markham et al. (30). These compounds prefer an anti conformation in aqueous solution. The LMP2/ccPVTZ(-f)//B3LYP/6-31G* calculated energy difference between the anti and syn conformations was 1.06 kcal/mol for MMTA and 0.88 kcal/mol for MTA, favoring the anti conformation in each case. Stopped-Flow Experiments. An intrinsic fluorescence change was observed when AdoMetDC was rapidly mixed with AdoMet. However, when SAH was mixed with AdoMetDC, there was no significant change other than that determined to be due to photobleaching (compared to a control without SAH). This indicates that SAH binding is much weaker and/or produces no discernible conformational change. The signal when MMTA was mixed with AdoMetDC was also too weak to measure the kinetics of the binding reaction. Kinetic data for AdoMet binding to WT AdoMetDC along with the F223A, F7A, and E247A mutants were collected. For WT, F7A, and E247A, the data were best fit to a doubleexponential equation F ¼ A1 e -1 t þ A2 e -2 t þ C

According to this model, the fast phase of the reaction occurs at an observed rate approximately equal to the sum of all four intrinsic rate constants (34): 1 k1 ½S þ k -1 þ k2 þ k -2 A linear fit of the fast phase (AdoMet binding to the WT enzyme) results in a k1 of 0.136 ( 0.005 M-1 s-1, a k-1 of 33 ( 2 s-1, and a k2+k-2 value of 3.7 ( 0.2 s-1. Therefore, the dissociation constant (Kd) for binding of AdoMet to AdoMetDC can be estimated to be 242 ( 17 M from the k-1/k1 ratio. For the F7A and E247A mutants, the data were analyzed in a similar fashion except that a lower overall signal change caused photobleaching to become a significant component of the data. Therefore, the decrease due to photobleaching was corrected by using data from a control reaction mixture from which substrate had been omitted (resulting in a linear decrease in fluorescence). After correction, the kinetic parameters were obtained as for the WT enzyme. The values of k-1 and k2+k-2 were similar for both mutants, but the value of the second-order rate constant for substrate binding (k1) changed significantly. On the basis of the values of k1 and k-1, the Kd for the F7A mutant was 370 ( 60 M and the Kd for the E247A mutant was 12.2 ( 3.6 mM. The fluorescence change seen upon mixing AdoMet with the F223A mutant was best fit using a single-exponential equation. The concentration dependence of the observed rate varied linearly with a slope (k1) of (1.7 ( 0.3)Â 10-4 M-1 s-1 and a y-intercept (k-1) of 2.4 ( 0.2 s-1, yielding a Kd of 14 ( 3 mM. Generally, the values measured here follow the same trend as the steady state kinetic parameters (kcat and Km) obtained previously (22). A comparison of Kd values for AdoMet binding to WT, F223A, F7A, and E247A reveals that the importance of residues for substrate binding decreases in the following order: F223A  E247A . F7A>WT. DISCUSSION Cation- Interactions and Ligand Specificity of AdoMetDC. Cation- interactions are ubiquitous in nature and aid in protein stability, ligand recognition, catalysis, and ion channel function (35, 36). In the gas phase, the energy of binding of cations to aromatic groups ranges from 10 to 40 kcal/mol which places the cation- interaction among the strongest noncovalent forces (35, 37). The magnitude of the cation- interaction depends on the geometry, distance, and nature of the cation and the aromatic group. In biological systems, the bulk of these interactions are seen with the amino acid side chains of proteins. Aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine interact with positively charged amino acids such as lysine and arginine. The energetics of these interactions have been

studied both experimentally and theoretically (38, 39). In a few cases, ligand recognition by an enzyme is attributed completely to the cation- interaction (40). It has been shown that AdoMetDC binds substrate analogues only if they have a positive charge at the sulfonium position (20). MHZPA and MAOEA, which do not contain a sulfonium center, have an ammonium group that is protonated at physiological pH. The inability to form MTA and SAH complexes in cocrystallization experiments is consistent with this observation.

The results reported here suggest that cation- interactions play a primary role in determining substrate specificity. The crystal structure of AdoMetDC with MMTA shows that the sulfonium center is at a favorable distance and geometry for a cation- interaction with Phe223. The positive charge of the sulfonium ion is distributed to the adjacent methyl and the methylene groups (Figure 4). The methylene group of MMTA is at a favorable distance and geometry for a cation- interaction with Phe7. The quantum chemical calculations suggest the stabilization of a (CH3)3S+ group in the active site is primarily due to its interaction with Phe223 and Phe7. Other ligands with a positive charge such as MHZPA, MAOEA, MeAdoMet, and DMAMA exhibit similar interactions with Phe223 and Phe7 (Figure 5). The magnitude of stabilization obtained due to the cation- interaction is approximately -4.5 kcal/mol. The interaction may be weakened from its maximum value by distribution of positive charge to adjacent carbon and hydrogen atoms and because of nonideal geometry. The cation- interaction as a theme for sulfonium recognition was debated by Markham et al. on the basis of a survey of the crystal structures of AdoMet with various enzymes (30). The

FIGURE 3: Plots of observed rates vs AdoMet concentration for the WT, F223A, F7A, and E247A enzymes. The linear concentration dependence
of the observed rates was fit using a line which allowed for the definition of k1 and k-1. A hyperbolic fit of the slow phase defined the sum of k2 and k-2, except in the case of F223A, where the kinetics were monophasic and indicative of a more simple one-step binding model. In this case, the slope of the best fit line defines the k1 and the y-intercept defines the k-1 directly.

survey which spanned 20 crystal structures showed that the sulfonium of AdoMet interacts with negatively charged atoms and aromatic amino acids in very few cases. In glycine-Nmethyltransferase (PDB entry 1xva) and HhaI DNA methylase (PDB entry 1hmy), the sulfonium interacts with negatively charged carboxylate atoms (41, 42). There are only two cases in the survey in which the sulfonium ion has a close contact with ° an aromatic group. The sulfonium ion of AdoMet is 3.2 A from the methylene carbon atom of Trp41 in HhaI DNA methylase (PDB entry 1hmy), and in the structure of AdoMetDC with ° MeAdoMet bound (PDB entry 1i7b), the sulfonium ion is 4.1 A from the center of Phe223. The survey concluded that in a broader picture, cation- interactions are not a recurring theme for sulfonium recognition. However, the uniqueness of the AdoMet decarboxylation reaction in this study may explain the importance of cation- interactions for AdoMetDC, which is further supported by theoretical calculations and stopped-flow kinetic experiments. Stabilization of the syn Conformation by AdoMetDC. The conformational preference of AdoMet in solution and gas phase was studied by Markham et al. (30). According to the NMR studies, AdoMet prefers an anti conformation about the glycosidic bond in solution and a syn conformation in vacuum. The energy difference between the anti and syn conformations in solution was calculated to be -34 kcal/mol on the basis of the modeling studies using NMR constraints. This energy difference was calculated on the basis of molecular mechanics without polarization effects, and it is likely that the actual difference is less negative (23). The crystal structures of AdoMetDC with

MeAdoMet, MHZPA, and MAOEA reported previously showed that the enzyme binds the ligands in the energetically unfavorable syn conformation (22). The crystal structures of AdoMetDC with MMTA and DMAMA also show that the adenosine moiety binds in a syn conformation. The quantum chemical calculations for MMTA in a truncated model of the enzyme with only Phe7, Phe223, and Glu247 included suggest that the syn conformation of the ligand is stabilized by 12 kcal/mol compared to the hypothetical anti conformation, which has never been observed in an AdoMetDC complex. The actual energy difference is likely to be greater than the value given above since the anti conformation places the sixmembered ring of the adenine in the proximity of Asn224 and Pro225. Moreover, the amino group on the adenine ring is in the proximity of and forms hydrogen bonds to Glu67 in the syn conformation but forms no appreciable interactions with the enzyme in the anti conformation. The syn conformation of the adenine base is primarily stabilized by stacking interactions with Phe7 and Phe223 and hydrogen bonds of the ribose to Glu247. N3 of the adenine base carries a partial negative charge and interacts favorably with the sulfonium ion. This electrostatic effect further contributes to the stabilization of the syn conformation of the ligand. The preference of AdoMetDC to bind ligands in the syn conformation was recently exploited in the design of substrate analogues with enhanced affinity. Substitution at the C8 position on the adenine base favored the syn conformation, resulting in a 5-18-fold increase in potency compared to those of the unsubstituted compounds (23).

The MMTA analogue DMAMA shows that the replacement of the sulfur with nitrogen also yields a competitive inhibitor because the nitrogen is protonated at physiological pH. DMAMA has a methyl substitution at the 8-position which should favor the syn conformation in solution and improve the binding to AdoMetDC (23). Because MMTA and DMAMA lack hydrazino or oxyamino groups, which react nonspecifically with cellular aldehydes and ketones, and because further evolution of their structures is possible, MMTA and DMAMA, with IC50 values of 15 M and 600 nM (23), respectively, are promising lead compounds for inhibitor design.

FIGURE 4: Schematic diagram of the key interactions MMTA makes
in the active site of AdoMetDC. The adenine base stacks in the syn conformation aided by aromatic stacking interactions with Phe7 and Phe223. N6 of the adenine base forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Glu67. The sulfonium ion and the terminal methyl group have a cation- interaction with Phe223 (colored red), and the partially positively charged methylene group adjacent to sulfonium interacts with Phe7. N3 is partially negatively charged and interacts with the sulfonium. The partial charges on the relevant atoms are indicated. The ribose makes two hydrogen bonds to Glu247.

FIGURE 5: Superposition of the complexes of AdoMetDC showing
the geometry of the cation- interaction between the positive sulfonium/nitrogen and Phe223. The color coding for the complexes is as follows: red for MMTA, magenta for DMAMA, green for MeAdoMet, blue for MAOEA, and yellow for MHZPA.

Insights into Inhibitor Design. The design of substrate analogue inhibitors for AdoMetDC benefits from the presence of a positive charge required for the cation- interaction. Unlike MAOEA and MHzPA, MMTA shows competitive inhibition because it lacks an amino terminus required to form a Schiff base with the active site pyruvoyl group. Studies on MMTA also show that the ribose, the adenine base, and the positive charge are sufficient for inhibition of AdoMetDC. The schematic diagram showing all of the stabilizing interactions of MMTA in the active site is shown in Figure 4.
