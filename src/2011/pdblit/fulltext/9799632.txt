The protein/protein interaction between SinI and SinR has been studied by analytical ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis in an attempt to understand how these proteins contribute to developmental control of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. SinR was found to be tetrameric, while SinI was found to exist as monomers and dimers in a rapidly reversible equilibrium. Labelling of SinR by incorporating the tryptophan analogue 7-azatryptophan (7AW) into the protein in place of tryptophan shifts the UV absorbance spectrum, thus allowing selective monitoring of 7AWSinR at 315 nm using the UV absorption optics of the analytical ultracentrifuge. Selective monitoring of SinR in mixtures of SinR and SinI enables the binding and stoichiometry of the interaction to be investigated quantitatively and unambiguously. We demonstrate that the oligomeric forms of SinR and SinI re-arrange to form a tight 1:1 SinR:SinI complex, with no stable intermediate species. A fragment of SinR, SinR(1-69), which contains only the DNA-binding domain, was found to be monomeric, showing that the protein appears not to oligomerise in a similar manner to the Cro repressor, a protein with which it shares a marked structural similarity.

Introduction
The formation of a resistant spore is the ultimate response of Bacillus subtilis to deteriorating environmental conditions (Stragier & Losick, 1996). The sin region of the B. subtilis chromosome encodes two proteins, SinR and SinI, which play antagonistic roles in the decision of the bacteria to embark on the pathway of sporulation. SinR is a 111 residue DNA-binding protein (Mr  13.0 kDa) which negatively regulates the transcription of many genes required for sporulation (MandicMulec et al., 1992, 1995). For sporulation to proceed the activity of SinR must be overcome. This is

brought about by SinI, a protein of 56 amino acid residues (Mr  6.6 kDa), and involves a quaternary structural rearrangement that results in the ef®cient formation of a heterodimeric SinI:SinR complex; SinR is then no longer able to bind to DNA cooperatively and hence inhibit transcription (Bai et al., 1993). The crystal structure of the SinI:SinR complex has recently been solved (Lewis et al., 1998). This revealed a two domain structure comprising a DNA-binding domain, with striking similarity to the corresponding domains of bacteriophage 434 CI and Cro repressors, along with a dimerisation domain made up of four a-helices: two from SinR and two from SinI. The pairs of helices from the respective proteins interpenetrate in a manner reminiscent of the fore®ngers and thumbs in a hand-shake (Figure 1(a)). The interactions which stabilise the SinI:SinR complex are readily apparent from the crystal structure (Figure 1(a) and (b));

SinI:SinR Interaction

however, crystals of uncomplexed SinR and SinI suitable for X-ray analysis have so far proved elusive. It has been suggested, on the basis of gel-®ltration studies, that SinR is a tetramer; similar experiments with SinI were inconclusive, although it was inferred that SinI has a higher order structure than a monomer (Gaur et al., 1991). As a SinI:SinR heterodimer can only be formed from one copy of each of the proteins, there will obviously have to be major quaternary rearrangement of SinI and SinR. It is almost certainly signi®cant in regard to the quaternary reorganisation accompanying the formation of the SinI:SinR heterodimer that SinI and SinR share sequence similarities. The sequences between residues 74 and 103 of SinR and 11 and 40 of SinI share ten identities, and at a further ten positions they have residues of a similar type (Figure 1(c)). In the crystal structure of the heterodimer these residues are seen to form the ahelices which are responsible for heterodimer formation (Figure 1(b)). It would seem likely that these same helices mediate protomer/protomer interactions in the respective SinR and SinI oligomers in an analogous fashion. To explore the mechanism of this striking quaternary reorganisation and to provide information on functional aspects of the interaction of SinR with SinI, we have carried out a detailed quantitative study of the interaction of the two proteins in solution using analytical ultracentrifugation with UV absorption optics. Ultraviolet absorption and ¯uorescence spectroscopy are vital tools in the study of macromolecular associations in solution; however, the fact that all proteins exhibit very

In (b) the side-chains of tryptophan residues are drawn in ball-and-stick ``format''. The structure consists of two domains, a DNA-binding domain (left) and a dimerisation domain (right). It is formed by residues 10 to 40 of SinI and 74 to 108 of SinR which together form a bundle of four a-helices, two of which are provided by each protein. The pair of SinI a-helices span residues 13-25 and 29-38, respectively. They are connected by a three residue turn such that the dihedral angle between them is 127  . The pair of a-helices from SinR spanning residues 76-87 and 92-107, are connected by a four-residue linker and the dihedral angle between these helices is once again 127  . These a-helices interpenetrate in the SinI:SinR complex like a pair of fore®ngers and thumbs in a handshake. Hydrophobic side-chains lining the inner surfaces of the four helices form a buried intermolecular hydrophobic core. Contributing to this core are residues Leu11, Trp15, Val16, Leu18, Met19, Ala22, Ala25, Ile27, Pro29, Ile32, Tyr35 and Leu36 of SinI and Trp78, Leu81, Val82, Ala85, Val90, Phe95, Phe98 and Leu99 of SinR. Besides these non-polar contacts, there are just two direct polar interactions between SinI and the C-terminal residues of SinR; salt-bridges between

Glu14 of SinI and Arg96 of SinR and between Arg33 of SinI and Glu77 of SinR. Trp104 of SinR is situated on the surface of the molecule with one face of the indole ring parallel with the amide group of Gln108 but otherwise exposed to the solvent. Trp15 of SinI and Trp78 of SinR are integral components of the intermolecular hydrophobic core. (c) Alignment of the sequences of SinI and SinR used in heterodimer formation. The location of a-helices is shown above the sequences, asterisks indicate amino acid residue identities, bold characters indicate residues contributing to the hydrophobic core, while residues in italics participate in intermolecular salt bridges. In proposing a model for the mechanism of SinI antagonism of SinR function, Gaur et al. (1991) noted the close similarity between the sequences of the two proteins in these regions and they suggested that these segments might have a multimerisation function both in the construction of SinR and SinI homo-oligomers as well as in SinI:SinR heterodimers. According to this hypothesis, the displacement, or sequestration, by SinI, of SinR monomers from their tetramer takes place through a process analogous to domain swapping. The crystal structure of the SinI:SinR complex bears this theory out. The two segments of structure SinI(11-40) and SinR(74-103) overlap closely Ê (rmsÁ  $ 1 A) following least-squares minimisation of the differences in the positions of their main-chain atoms.

Figure 2. (a) Absorption spectra of 7AWSinR and native SinR. There is greater than 95 % incorporation of 7AW into SinR. Incorporation of 7AW was achieved in a similar fashion as described by Ross et al. (1997) and Scott et al. (1999a). A 5 ml sample of an overnight culture of Escherichia coli CY15077 (trpÀ) lysogenised with lDE3 for T7 overexpression (J.G.H. et al., unpublished results), containing the expression plasmid pETSinR and pETSinI was used to inoculate 500 ml of LB  100 mg/ml ampicillin. This was incubated at 37  C with shaking, until the A600 had reached 0.8-1.0 unit. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for ®ve minutes at 20  C using a GS-3 rotor in a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge. Cell pellets were drained and then resuspended in 500 ml of M9 supplemented with 0.5 ml of (5 mg/ml) vitamin B1, 10 ml of 20 % (w/v) glucose, 0.5 ml of 0.1 M CaCl2, 1 ml of 1 M MgSO4 and 100 mg/ml ampicillin. The resuspended cells were then incubated and shaken at 37  C for 45 minutes to one hour, or until there was no further increase in A600. At such a time 2.5 ml of a 10 mg/ml solution of 7AW was added and after ten minutes further incubation, expression of recombinant protein was induced with 1 mM IPTG. Cultures were then allowed to grow for a further three hours before harvesting. Proteins were puri®ed as reported (Lewis et al., 1996). (b) Structures of tryptophan and 7AW, which differs from tryptophan by the replacement of the carbon atom at ring position 7 by a nitrogen atom. This very limited alteration produces no change in the functional properties of 7AWSinR, while causing the absorbance spectrum of 7AWSinR to be red-shifted.

similar native spectroscopic properties is a dif®culty which is particularly problematic in the analysis of protein/protein interactions, since it is usually impossible to identify or assign the spectroscopic contributions of individual protein components in a mixture. The conventional method of dealing with this problem is to label one of the proteins with an extrinsic spectroscopic probe. Although this approach can be used to good effect, the potential dif®culties of introducing a large extrinsic label, thereby interfering with the structure and interactions of the native protein(s), are well recognised. This is likely to be a problem in the present case, since the interaction of SinI and SinR as revealed in the crystal structure is so intimate, and involves a large proportion of the surface of the small SinI protein. In view of this potential dif®culty, we have employed a different strategy by biosynthetically incorporating an analogue of tryptophan, 7-azatryptophan (7AW), in place of the naturally occurring tryptophan residues. The SinI/SinR heterodimer contains three tryptophan residues, two in SinR (Trp78 and Trp104), and one in SinI (Trp15) and all three are located in the dimerisation domain (Figure 1(b)). The advantage of 7AW as a spectroscopic probe is that its absorption spectrum is red-shifted some 10-20 nm away from the

main protein absorption peak (Figure 2(a)), thus conferring distinct UV absorption or ¯uorescence spectra on the labelled protein. Additionally, 7AW represents a fairly conservative structural change (Figure 2(b)) and thus will be less likely to compromise function, acting in essence as an intrinsic probe, a fact borne out in many recent studies of

For SinI the determined apparent molecular mass M0 w,app is of the monomer as this protein was found to be in a monomer/dimer equilibrium. The sedimentation coef®cient for SinI was determined at values in excess of 15 times the derived dissociation constant, and was therefore assumed to be a single species under these conditions.

Such derivatised proteins have been termed ``spectrally enhanced'' proteins (SEPs), a name re¯ecting their unique spectral properties (Hogue & Szabo, 1993). We report here the results of studies on equilibrium aspects of the protein/protein

1001 Ultracentrifugation Both SinI, SinR and 7AWSinR were analysed separately by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium. The results of these experiments are summarised in Table 1. As can be seen from the equilibrium data, SinR is present as a tetramer, as had been suggested from gel ®ltration studies. SinI was found to be in a rapidly reversible monomer/dimer equilibrium (Figure 4(a)) with a Kd derived from non-linear least-squares analysis of 1.8 mM (95 % con®dence range 1.0-2.9 mM). This would explain the apparent higher-order structure previously postulated (Guar et al., 1991). It should be noted that the results from these sedimentation equilibrium experiments are unaffected by the shape of the molecules, unlike empirical methods

be examined by electrophoresis, the discrimination between SinI and the SinI/SinR complex is lost. Thus native 8.5 % polyacrylamide gels were buffered at pH 8.8. Although the results of these gels (Figure 3) were consistent with the premise that SinI ef®ciently disrupts SinR to form a new heterocomplex with stoichiometry of 1:1, it was not possible to differentiate between SinI1/SinR1 and (SinI1/SinR1)n where n > 1. It was evident, however, that SinI and SinR form a tight complex, since only two species are observed in this analysis, the (SinI/SinR)n (n 5 1) heterocomplex and the excess material, either SinI or SinR. In order to examine further the formation of the SinI/SinR complex, we utilised analytical ultracentrifugation.

The ®t is to a monomer/dimer rapidly reversible equilibrium using the software supplied with the ultracentrifuge. Data from three different concentrations at 16 K, 22 K and 28 K rpm was used for the ®t. The lack of scatter in the residual plot shown above the ®tted data shows that this model describes the data well, and there is no evidence of further association of dimers into tetramers. (b) Typical sedimentation equilibrium trace of SinR at 22 K rpm and pH 6.0 (50 mM Mes, 150 mM NaCl). At this pH it was found that the data could best be described by a dimer/tetramer model. Data from three different loading concentrations at 12 K, 16 K and 22 K were used to ®t the data. Again, the residual plots have been displayed above the data to show the quality of the ®t. (c) A titration of M0 w,app versus [SinI] calculated from data at 280 nm. The two lines superimposed on the graph are the decreases in M0 w,app expected for tight binding limit (continuous line) and no interaction (broken line). (d) A titration of M0 w,app [SinI] calculated from data at 315 nm. The broken line across the top of the graph is the change in M0 w,app that would be expected if no interaction occurred between 7AWSinR and SinI. As can clearly be seen, there is a decrease in M0 w,app from around 52 kDa to 19.5 kDa, the values for the SinR tetramer and the SinI:SinR heterodimer, respectively. All analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out with a Beckman XL-A ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto CA, USA) using an AN-Ti 60 rotor. The set temperature on the ultracentrifuge was 20  C. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 40,000 rpm in Epon two-channel centrepieces, with data collected at approximately ®ve minute intervals. Sedimentation coef®cients were obtained from non-linear ®ts to the Lamm equation using the program SVEDBERG (Philo, 1997). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 12,000, 16,000, 22,000 and 28,000 rpm in Epon six-channel centrepieces. Radial scans taken four hours apart were overlaid to check that equilibrium had been attained at each speed. Data were scanned at 280 and 400 nm for wild-type proteins, and an additional scan was taken at 315 nm for experiments involving spectrally enhanced proteins. Scans at 400 nm (Svensson, 1956; Scott et al., 1999) were used to detect the presence of Weiner skewing. After the ®nal scan was taken the rotor speed was increased to 36,000 rpm for eight hours to clear the meniscus. A radial scan was then taken of each cell so as to determine a true optical baseline. In the case of SinI, this speed was inadequate to clear the meniscus, and therefore the baseline was a ¯oated parameter in the regression analysis, and was found to be very small (A < 0.025). The partial speci®c volumes of the SinI and SinR were calculated as 0.7359 cm3 gÀ1and 0.7329 cm3 gÀ1, respectively, from the amino acid sequence using the program SEDNTERP according to the method of Laue et al. (1992). No net charge contribution to the partial speci®c volume was assumed, as at pH 7.5 SinI carries a charge of only À1. The solvent was 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and the solvent density was calculated as 1.00576 using the SEDNTERP program. Sedimentation velocity data was analysed using the program SVEDBERG (Philo, 1997). Sedimentation coef®cients were corrected to water at 20  C using SEDNTERP, and this value was then used for calculation of the frictional ratio ( f/fo), where fo was calculated for an unhydrated sphere. Sedimentation equilibrium data were analysed by non-linear regression using the software supplied with the centrifuge. Data were ®tted ®rstly, as a single ideal species, then as a single non-ideal species, and ®nally as a self-associating ideal system. Appropriate models were assumed upon the basis of goodness of ®t as judged by a non-systematic deviation of the È residual plots. The whole cell molecular M0 w,app was determined using the program MSTAR (Colfen & Harding, 1997). The M* function is an operational point average molecular mass given by: r Cr À Ca  kCa r2 À a2   2k rCr À Ca dr MÃ r a where C(r) is the concentration at radius r, Ca is the concentration at the radial position of the meniscus a, M* is the " operational point average molecular mass, and k  (1À" r)o2/2RT, where v is the partial speci®c volume, r is the denv sity, o is the angular velocity, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the thermodynamic temperature.

1002 such as gel ®ltration, whose interpretation is very dependent on the shape of the protein (Harding, 1994). In fact, analysis of the sedimentation velocity results (Table 1) shows that both SinI and SinR are quite elongated, both having frictional ratios (f/fo) of about 1.6, compared with (f/fo)  1.0 for a sphere (Cantor & Schimmel, 1980; Harding, 1995). The absorption spectra for native and 7AWSinR clearly show that the absorption spectrum of the derivatised proteins is red-shifted such that there is appreciable absorbance between 300 and 320 nm (Figure 2(a)). The degree of incorporation of 7AW into SinR was determined to be >95 % by a linear combination of spectra (LINCS) analysis (Ross et al., 1992; Scott et al., unpublished results). On this basis, the extinction coef®cient of the protein at 280 nm was calculated to be 10 780 MÀ1 cmÀ1, which was then used in subsequent determinations of protein concentration. 7AWSinR was found to have the same molecular mass (53,000(Æ1600) Da) and sedimentation coef®cient (s0  3.1 S) as the 20,w native SinR. To characterise the formation of the heterodimer, titration experiments were performed where 7AWSinR was mixed with increasing concentrations of SinI and the mixtures analysed by sedimentation equilibrium. One parameter that can be readily determined from sedimentation equilibrium experiments is the weight averaged molecular mass, M0 w,app, for the whole cell, which is de®ned as:  Mi c i   M0 wYapp ci 1

SinI:SinR Interaction

values of which re¯ect the molecular mass distribution of the system, where Mi is the molecular mass of the ith component, ci is its weight concentration, and n is the total number of molecular species of macromolecule, M. The value of M0 w,app determined at 280 nm re¯ects the molecular mass distribution of all of the protein components in the cell: SinR, SinI and the SinI:SinR complex. However, in such a titration experiment, the value of M0 w,app will decrease upon the addition of SinI even if (as one extreme limiting case) there is no interaction between the species, because of the lower molecular mass of the SinI species. The other limiting case, that of tight binding between SinR and SinI to form a heterodimer, will likewise cause a reduction in M0 w,app upon addition of SinI. The experimental values of M0 w,app determined at 280 nm, together with the theoretical distributions that would be expected for the two extreme hypotheses are shown in Figure 4(c). It can be seen that within the limits of error the data can be described by either curve, making it impossible (from the data at 280 nm) to determine whether an interaction is occurring. The corresponding results at 315 nm, however, do allow a ready distinction between the two

hypotheses (Figure 4(d)), since now the absorbance reports on the distribution of free and bound 7AWSinR, and SinI is transparent at this wavelength. As SinR is a tetramer, then in the limiting case of no interaction between SinI and SinR, the value of M0 w,app will simply be the molecular mass of the tetramer, unaffected by the presence of SinI. The determined values of M0 w,app at 315 nm (Figure 4(b)) decrease with increasing concentrations of SinI from a value around 53 kDa (tetrameric SinR) to around 19.5 kDa, a value close to that expected (19.6 kDa) for the heterodimer. The continuous line represents the tight binding limiting case, and it is evident that the experimental data ®t closely to the model, implying that binding to form a 1:1 complex is tight, as suggested by the results of the native gel electrophoresis; additionally, the complex present in solution is the (SinI1/SinR1) heterocomplex, and not any higher oligomeric form. This means that the determined crystal structure of the SinI/SinR complex can be regarded as re¯ecting accurately the solution oligomeric state. The complementary experiment where SinR was titrated against 7AWSinI was also performed and showed comparable results (data not shown). The results clearly demonstrate the usefulness of tryptophan analogues in analysing these protein/ protein interactions in solution. Studies carried out at pH 6.0 showed that SinR exists as a dimer/tetramer equilibrium with a Kd  6.7 mM (95 % con®dence range 5.5-8.1 mM) (Figure 4(b)). It appears, therefore, that SinR is a dimer of dimers, implying that the building block for tetramers is most likely a dimer rather than a sequential addition of monomers. The close structural similarity between the DNA-binding domains of bacteriophage 434 Cro protein and SinR (Lewis et al., 1998) suggests a further way in which SinR monomers may assemble into dimers, and hence tetramers. Cro protein is a monomer in solution but forms a dimer upon binding to its cognate operator. The interactions between the Cro monomers in the dimer involve residues of helices 3 and 4 and the segment of the polypeptide connecting them. To test whether SinR might use a corresponding surface from the DNA-binding domain in the assembly of oligomers, we constructed a truncated SinR, SinR(1-69), comprising just the DNA-binding domain and subjected it to ultracentrifuge analysis. From both sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity runs, SinR(1-69) was found to have a molecular mass of 6.2 (Æ0.1) kDa, compared with a calculated molecular mass of 6.2 kDa. These ultracentrifuge data show that the SinR fragment is completely monomeric in solution and shows no tendency to associate to higher multimers. Apparently, multimerisation requires the C-terminal domain of the protein, the same region that the crystal structure shows is involved in heterodimer formation.

1003 interactions such as those responsible for adaptive responses in micro-organisms.

Conclusion
We have established unequivocally that SinR has a tetrameric structure which comprises a dimer of dimers; the interaction between two monomers to form a dimer is tighter than that responsible for the formation of the tetramer. Furthermore, the fact that SinR(1-69) is completely monomeric establishes that the C-terminal domain of the protein is required for dimerisation, and hence tetramer formation. Additionally, sedimentation velocity results show that the gross shape of SinR varies greatly from a sphere, with (f/fo)  1.6. Without further structural information it is not possible at present to speculate further on the monomer subunit arrangement of the SinR tetramer. In contrast, SinI has been shown to participate in a rapidly reversible monomer/dimer association with no evidence of tetramer formation. This implies that the interaction region between two monomers in SinI is much weaker than the corresponding interaction in SinR. The fact that monomeric SinI is available for interaction with SinR is signi®cant for the association, since the SinI monomer must somehow displace a SinR monomer from the tetramer. The ultracentrifuge results using spectrally enhanced proteins establish that the heterogeneous interaction between SinI and SinR is very tight, consistent with the results of native gel electrophoresis (Figure 3), and is suf®ciently strong to overcome the corresponding interaction between SinR subunits in tetrameric SinR. The heterogeneous interaction is essentially irreversible, forming a kind of deadend complex sequestering the available SinR. This irreversibility is an important feature for the mechanism of regulation of sporulation in B. subtilis, since sinR is constituitively expressed in B. subtilis whereas sinI is under developmental control and expressed under conditions that favour sporulation (Bai et al. 1993). The pathway of the SinI/SinR interaction is intriguing given the quaternary structural re-arrangement that needs to take place. We are currently investigating the mechanism of the process by studying the kinetics of the interaction, again exploiting the unique spectroscopic properties of the tryptophan analogue forms of the proteins. The tryptophan analogue methodology that has been employed in the current work has been used previously to study macromolecular interactions, but these have focused on interactions between proteins and DNA (Laue et al., 1993; Senear et al., 1993; Rusinova et al., 1997; Callaci & Heyduk, 1998). However, as we have demonstrated here, the technique is ideally suited for the study of protein/protein interactions, particularly for heterogeneous interactions. By being able to speci®cally label (in a very conservative way) one of the components of an interaction, it is possible to dissect and analyse quantitatively complex arrays of protein/protein
