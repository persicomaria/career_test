Metallothioneins are small cysteine-rich proteins believed to play a role, among others, in the homeostasis of essential metal ions such as ZnII and CuI. Recently, we could show that wheat Ec-1 is coordinating its six ZnII ions in form of metal­thiolate clusters analogously to the vertebrate metallothioneins. Specifically, two ZnII ions are bound in the N-terminal and four in the C-terminal domain. In the following, we will present evidence for the relative independence of the two domains from each other with respect to their metal ion binding abilities, and uncover three intriguing peculiarities of the protein. Firstly, one ZnII ion of the N-terminal domain is relative resistant to complete replacement with CdII indicating the presence of a ZnII-binding site with increased stability. Secondly, the C-terminal domain is able to coordinate an additional fifth metal ion, though with reduced affinity, which went undetected so far. Finally, reconstitution of apoEc-1 with an excess of ZnII shows a certain amount of sub-stoichiometrically metalloaded species. The possible relevance of these finding for the proposed biological functions of wheat Ec-1 will be discussed. In addition, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements on both, the full-length and the truncated protein, provide final evidence for His participation in metal ion binding.

1. Introduction Metallothioneins (MTs) are low molecular mass ($4­10 kDa) and cysteine-rich proteins with a preference for the coordination of metal ions with d10 electron configuration (e.g. ZnII, CuI, CdII). Their occurrence is reported throughout the animal kingdom, in plants, several eukaryotic microorganisms, as well as in some prokaryotes. The current MT classification system utilizes a total of 15 families based on taxonomic relationships with the plant metallothioneins constituting family 15 [1]. Plant MTs are further categorized into four main subfamilies, p1, p2, p3, and pec, according to the total number of cysteine residues and their distribution pattern along the peptide chain [2]. The early cysteine labelled protein (Ec1) from Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) was the first MT identified in higher plants [3,4]. The protein was first isolated from wheat germs as a zinc-binding protein [4] and suggested to be involved in the regulation of the zinc levels during embryogenesis [5]. In light of the importance of zinc ions for the early as well as for the later development of T. aestivum [6], investigation of the metal-binding properties of Ec-1 is of exceptional interest. Ec-1 is a member of the pec subfamily, which presents with 21% the highest cysteine content of all plant MT isoforms. With a total peptide chain length of 81 amino acids, 17 of them cysteine resi* Corresponding author. Tel.: +41 44 635 4621; fax: +41 44 635 6802. E-mail address: freisinger@aci.uzh.ch (E.

dues, it differs from members of the other plant MT subgroups in that the Cys residues are concentrated in three regions instead of only two. These cysteine-rich regions are separated by two linkers of 14 and 15 amino acids length, which are devoid of aromatic amino acids. This absence of aromatic amino acids is analogous to e.g. the vertebrate MTs, but in contrast to the linker regions of the other three plant MT subfamilies. Two highly conserved histidine residues are located next to and within the central cysteine-rich region of all pec proteins discovered so far, while they are strictly absent from vertebrate MTs. Histidine residues have been shown to participate in metal ion-binding in a bacterial MT forming a Zn4Cys9His2 cluster and conferring distinctive metal ion-binding properties to the protein [7]. For the plant MT3 from Musa acuminata (banana) we could show that mutation of the His residue to Cys slightly decreased the pH stability of the ZnII­thiolate cluster formed, while at the same time the stability of the analogous CdII­thiolate cluster was increased [8]. Other members of the pec subfamily were identified for example in Sesamum indicum (sesame) [9], Zea mays (maize) [10], and Arabidopsis thaliana (rock cress) [11]. Our previous results showed that Ec-1 coordinates six divalent d10 metal ions arranged in two separate metal ion-binding domains [12]. The C-terminal domain, C-Ec-1, encloses the central and the C-terminal Cys-rich regions thus featuring a total of 11 Cys and 2 His residues as potential coordinating ligands, and can bind four divalent metal ions. The N-terminal domain contains the residues of the N-terminal Cys-rich region and coordinates two metal

ions presumably via the six Cys residues leading to a metal­thiolate cluster of unprecedented stoichiometry for MTs. Therefore, in continuation of the currently used MT domain nomenclature, we designated this metal ion-binding domain as the c-domain (c-Ec-1). In principle, the 11 Cys residues of C-Ec-1 could provide sufficient binding sites for four metal ions, yielding a cluster structure of the same kind as the a-domain of the vertebrate MT isoforms [13]. Nevertheless, a possible participation of the two His residues in metal ion-binding cannot and should not be ruled-out. In this article we present the characterization of C-Ec-1 and perform a comparison with the full-length Ec-1 metallothionein. The data supports the self-sufficiency of the C-terminal domain with respect to the rest of the protein, i.e. the putative N-terminal Zn2Cys6 cluster and the connecting first linker region. In addition, an in-depth investigation with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) enables us to reveal specific metal ion coordination properties such as a preference of certain binding sites for a specific metal ion. Finally, also based on the ESI-MS data, we will elucidate the metal­thiolate cluster formation process and discuss possible biological implications of the observed results. 2. Experimental 2.1. Chemicals and solutions Cadmium acetate, zinc acetate, ammonium acetate, and methanol were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), porcine pancreas trypsin and Pfu DNA polymerase from Promega AG (Wallisellen, Switzerland), oligonucleotides for PCR reactions from Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland), Dpn1 was from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA), Chelex100Ò resin from Bio-Rad (Reinach, Switzerland), Luria-Bertani (LB) broth from Difco (Chemie Brunschwig AG, Basel, Switzerland) and DNAse I from Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland). All solutions were prepared with deionised water. When necessary, water was vacuum-degassed and nitrogen-saturated. 2.2. Ec-1 and C-Ec-1 expression and purification Expression of full-length Ec-1 was performed without an auxiliary purification-tag. For this, the pTYB2-based expression vector (IMPACTTM-CN system, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) used previously [12,14] was modified by mutating the CCC-codon of the Xma1 restriction site to TGA in order to suppress the expression of the C-terminal intein-tag by the resulting STOP-codon. To introduce the mutation, the entire plasmid was amplified in a single PCR step using two appropriate self-complementary primers carrying the desired mutation in the middle of the sequence. After digestion of the unmodified vector with Dpn1, the mixture was transformed into the Escherichia coli cell line XL1 blue without further purification. Mutation of the vector was verified with DNA sequencing (Microsynth AG). The vector was transformed into the E. coli expression cell line BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in LB medium and expression was induced by IPTG (1 mM) for 6 h at 30 °C in the presence of 1 mM CdCl2. Cells from 800 mL cell culture were harvested and resuspended in 50 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 60 mM mercaptoethanol (32 mL). Cells were disrupted by sonication while cooling in an ice-bath. All subsequent steps were carried out with gentle stirring at 4 °C under a constant flow of nitrogen gas. After drop-wise addition of a prechilled (À20 °C) mixture of ethanol (95%, 48.4 mL) and chloroform (3.8 mL), the precipitated cell debris was centrifuged off. The resulting supernatant was mixed drop-wise with 95% ethanol (185 mL), again centrifuged, and the pellet re-solubilized in 20 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM MgCl2 (10 mL) containing 1 mg of DNase I. After 1 h

incubation at room temperature, the solution was finally purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 pg column (GE Healthcare, Otelfingen, Switzerland) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.5 and 50 mM NaCl. Expression yields averaged approximately 15 mg of Ec-1 per liter of cell culture. The sequence for C-Ec-1 was derived from the limited proteolytic digestion experiments with proteinase K as described previously [12] and encompasses residues 31À81 of the full-length protein as well as an N-terminal Met residue and the two C-terminal vector derived residues PG resulting in a total of 54 amino acids:

The expression vector was constructed from the pTYB2-based plasmid containing the cDNA sequence of full-length Ec-1 used before [12,14]. In a first step the codons of the two residues directly preceding the sequence for C-Ec-1, GCG GCG, were mutated to CAT ATG. The mutation was introduced in a single PCR step as described above for the insertion of a STOP-codon in the full-length Ec-1. The resulting additional NdeI restriction side was used to cut out the codons of the N-terminal domain. Hence, the C-terminal intein-tag was left unaffected and could be used for purification. Over-expression and purification of C-Ec-1 as well as reconstitution of the CdII- and ZnII-forms of Ec-1 and C-Ec-1 from the apo-forms were performed as described [12]. Yields for C-Ec1 were around 1.5 mg per liter of growth medium. To obtain the fully metal-loaded Zn4C-Ec-1 and Zn6Ec-1 forms, the partially demetalated ZnII species obtained by over-expression were supplemented with the appropriate amount of ZnCl2. Uniformity of species in solution was verified with ESI-MS. 2.3. CD spectroscopy Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of apo-, Cd4-, and Cd5C-Ec-1 (12.3 lM) in 4 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl were recorded with a J-715 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Japan). 2.4.

Cd NMR spectroscopy

NMR samples were prepared by reconstitution of the apo-forms with 113CdII. Preparation of the apo-forms was done as described before [12]. Final concentrations and buffer conditions of the samples were 4.5 mM 113Cd6Ec-1 in 20 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl as well as 3.0 mM 113Cd4C-Ec-1 in 11 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.3 and 50 mM NaCl. 1H decoupled 113Cd NMR spectra were recorded with a 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Fällanden, Switzerland) relative to the signal of 1 M Cd(ClO4)2. 2.5. Mass spectrometry Samples of Ec-1 or C-Ec-1 were dialysed against 5 mM ammonium acetate pH $ 7.5 and injected directly into a quadropole time-of-flight (TOF) Ultima API spectrometer (Waters, UK). Scans were accumulated and processed by the software MassLynx 3.5 (Micromass). m/z Spectra were deconvoluted using the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt1 in MassLynx 3.5). Electrospray parameters were capillary 2.8 V, cone 60 V and source temperature 80 °C. 2.6. X-ray absorption spectroscopy For two different constructs, Zn6Ec-1 and Zn4C-Ec-1, X-ray absorption spectroscopy data were collected to determine the

average ZnII binding motifs. The K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were recorded at beamline D2 of the EMBL Outstation Hamburg at DESY, Germany. The DORIS storage ring operated at 4.5 GeV with the positron beam current ranging from 145 mA to 80 mA. An Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator scanned X-ray energies around the metal K-edge. Harmonic rejection was achieved by a focusing mirror (cut-off energy at 20.5 keV) and a monochromator detuning to 70% of its peak intensity. The sample cells were mounted in a two-stage Displex cryostat and kept at about 20 K. Spectra were recorded as Ka fluorescence spectra with a multi-element Ge solid-state detector. While processing a pulse the detector is frozen (dead time). We ensured that no more than 20% of the counts occurred in this period and corrected each data point for this effect. X-ray energy calibration was achieved by recording Bragg reflections from a static Si(2 2 0) crystal in back-reflection geometry during each scan [15]. Data reduction, such as background removal, normalization and extraction of the fine structure, was performed with KEMP [16] assuming a threshold energy of E0,Zn = 9662 eV. The extracted K-edge EXAFS data were converted to photoelectron wave vector k-space and weighted by k3. Initial evaluation of the spectra by ABRA [17], which is based on EXCURV [18] included a systematic screening of $400 possible models. The subsequent meta-analysis identified structural Zn sites, and thus in the final refinement the total number of ligands was fixed to four. In addition to single scattering contributions, a multiple scattering unit was defined for His ligands. Parameters of each structural model, namely the atomic distances (R), the Debye-Waller factors (2r2), and a residual shift of the energy origin (EF) were refined, minimizing the fit index (U) taking into account restrains for the imidazole group [18]. An amplitude reduction factor (AFAC) of 1.0 was used throughout the data analysis. 2.7. pH Titrations followed by UV spectroscopy Titrations were performed by addition of diluted HCl to 800 lL aliquots of Zn4C-Ec-1 (7.6 lM) or Cd4C-Ec-1 (8.8 lM) in 1 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 8.6, 10 mM NaCl, as described [12]. Plots of molar absorptivity at 230 nm for the ZnII-form and at 250 nm for the CdIIform against pH values were fitted with three different functions, considering either one or two common apparent pKa values for the cysteine residues in presence of the respective metal ions as described [8,12]. In addition, a pH titration of the fully metalloaded form Zn6Ec-1 (15 lM) in 1 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.3, 10 mM NaCl was performed. 2.8. Metal ion substitution reactions Increasing amounts of cadmium acetate were added to 2 lM Zn4C-Ec-1 or Zn6Ec-1 in 5 mM ammonium acetate pH $ 7.5. All samples were incubated for 40 min and then analysed by ESI-MS. To identify the presence of metal ion-binding sites with lower affinity, samples (200 lL) were incubated with an excess of CdII (three more equivalents) and either analysed directly with ESIMS or after treatment with Chelex100Ò resin ($30 mg, pre-washed with water) for a period of 10 min up to 5 h. An approximate value for Kapp of the CdII-Chelex100Ò complex at pH 7.5 was calculated based on values for N-methyliminodiacetic acid [19], using the following formula:

yliminodiacetic acid K 0a ¼ 10À1:9 M; K 00 ¼ 10À2:3 M; and K 000 ¼ 10À9:6 M. a a

2.9. Titration of Zn6Ec-1 with CdII followed by limited proteolytic digestion Increasing amounts of cadmium acetate (0À7 equiv.) were added to 2 lM Zn6Ec-1 in 5 mM ammonium acetate pH $ 7.5. Each sample was then digested for 120 min with trypsin in a molar ratio of trypsin:Ec-1 of 1:50 and analysed by ESI-MS. Subsequently, each sample was acidified with formic acid to pH $ 2.5 and re-analysed by ESI-MS. 2.10. Fractional reconstitution of apoEc-1 with ZnII Except for the ESI-MS measurements, each step of this experiment was performed in a nitrogen-purged glove box. Separate aliquots of 17 lM apoEc-1 in 0.01 M HCl were mixed with increasing amounts of ZnII (0À9 equiv.). After metal ion addition, the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 4 M ammonium acetate pH 9.2. Samples were incubated for 40 min at room temperature, subsequently diluted to 2 lM with a 20 mM nitrogen-saturated ammonium acetate solution (pH $ 7.5, 50% methanol) and ESI-MS spectra recorded. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Coordination of metal ions by C-Ec-1 Over-expression of C-Ec-1 in ZnII-supplemented media yields a peptide containing 3.6À4.0 equiv. of ZnII based on F-AAS measurements combined with ÀSH group quantification using the 2-PDS assay. This metal ion-binding ability is in accordance with results from the limited proteolytic digestion experiments performed on the full-length Cd6Ec-1 protein described in [12], which showed that the central and the C-terminal Cys-rich regions of the protein co-elute together with four CdII ions. Purity and integrity of the newly expressed MT domain were controlled with ESI-MS measurements at pH 2 (Fig. 1A). As already observed for the full-length protein, also C-Ec-1 exists mainly in form of a species lacking the Nterminal translation initiator methionine. No other signals originating from impurities by other proteins or translational abortion products of C-Ec-1 expression were detected. ESI-MS measurements at pH 7.5 allow the observation of the metal ion-binding or holo-forms and confirm the ability of C-Ec-1 to bind up to four ZnII or CdII ions (Fig. 1B and C). The spectrum of Zn4C-Ec-1 shows again two species, with and without the N-terminal Met, while the sample of Cd4C-Ec-1 solely contains the Metdevoid species. A direct comparison of the m/z spectra of Zn4C-Ec-1 and Cd4C-Ec-1 (insets in Fig. 1B and C) reveals a significant difference. Both spectra are dominated by species with charges of +4, nevertheless, the spectrum of Zn4C-Ec-1 shows in addition some traces of the same species in the +5 charge-states, while the spectrum of Cd4C-Ec-1 contains a considerable population of the +3 charge-state. As discussed for other MTs studied by ESI-MS [20,21], such differences in charge-state populations of the CdIIand ZnII-forms (or other holo-forms) are indicative of a conformational variance between these species. This interpretation is based on the hypothesis that conformers with a more compact structure should result in a greater electrostatic repulsion between charges and consequently are expected to promote the formation of lower charge-states in ESI-MS. Hence, Cd4C-Ec-1 seems to be present in a conformation leading to greater charge repulsion than Zn4C-Ec-1. This finding might even give a tentative explanation for differences in the metal ion-binding abilities of the CdII-form compared to the ZnII-form as described below. It should be noted, however, that the

perception of a CdII-form being more compact than the corresponding ZnII-form is the opposite of what would be intuitively expected considering the larger ionic radius of CdII and is in contrast to findings for e.g. human MT3 [21]. 3.2. pH stability of the ZnII- and CdII-clusters in C-Ec-1 Release of ZnII and CdII ions from MTs can be provoked by acidification as the protons compete with the metal ions for the thiolate groups of the cysteine residues. As metal­thiolate clusters give rise to characteristic absorption bands originating mainly from thiolate ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions, the metal ion release reaction can be conveniently studied by UV spectroscopy. The positions and intensities of these LMCT bands

is specific for the kind of metal ion coordinated, e.g. 230 nm for ZnII­ and 250 nm for CdII­thiolate complexes [22,23]. The decrease of the respective LMCT band with decreasing pH values gives rise to spectra as depicted in Fig. 2A and B. If the absorption at 230 nm for the S?ZnII or at 250 nm for the S?CdII transition is plotted against the respective pH value (Fig. 2C), the resulting curves can be fitted to determine apparent pKa values for the cysteine thiolate groups in presence of the metal ion under investigation. Over the years, pH values of half-maximum absorbance, ½(Amax + Amin), obtained from such pH titration experiments, have been determined for a number of MTs studied from the different phyla of life. Though having only limited significance as no attention is paid to the more conclusive aspects such as the steepness of the curve and the presence of multiple titration steps, the value of half-maximum absorption is doubtless one of the very few parameters that enables the comparison of different MTs with each other. This value can either be read off directly from the pH titration curve, but it can also be determined more accurately by a curve fitting procedure as described in detail previously [8]. As

the apparent pKa value of the partially demetalated Zn5.7Ec-1 form obtained directly from purification in E. coli was found to be extraordinary low (4.26(1)) [12] it was re-determined for fully metal ion-loaded Zn6Ec-1 in the present work (4.530(7)). It is most likely, that the increased pH stability previously observed for Zn5.7Ec-1 was not due to the partial loss of ZnII ions but rather provoked by the presence of considerable amounts of species containing a C-terminal 1,4-dithiothreitol- (DTT-) adduct formed during the DTT-mediated self-splicing reaction of the intein purificationtag [14]. The Zn6Ec-1 species used in the present study was expressed and purified without an auxiliary purification-tag eliminating the possibility of such a DTT-adduct formation. For samples of C-Ec-1 special care was taken that prolonged dialysis times decreased the amount of DTT-adduct below the detection level of ESI-MS (Fig. 1A). Comparing the pKa values of the full-length Ec-1 protein with those of the truncated C-Ec-1 species only small differences can be observed within the 3r error range (Table 1). The value for Zn4C-Ec-1 is slightly lower than the one for Zn6Ec-1, while the reverse is observed when comparing Cd4C-Ec-1 with Cd6Ec-1. Overall, the apparent pKa values of the cysteine residues in Zn4C-Ec-1 and Zn6Ec-1 join the row of known pKa values above values for human [24] and equine MT [25], but are lower than pKa values of the separate domains of human MT2 [24], and significantly lower than the values determined for other plant MTs so far [8,26,27]. Similarily, Cd4C-Ec-1 and Cd6Ec-1 feature higher apparent pKa values of their cysteine residues than human [24] and equine MT [28], are roughly in the same range as mouse MT2 [29], and clearly lower than values obtained for monkey MT2 [30] and the other plant MTs [8,26,27]. These results suggest that the pH dependent metal ion coordination ability of the C-terminal domain is similar to the full-length Ec-1 or, in other words, that the presence or absence of the c-domain including the first linker region has no pronounced effect on metal ion-binding at least in the scope of the pH titration experiment. 3.3.

[12]. Additional 113Cd signals in the 664À659 ppm region of the spectrum might have been caused by residual ZnII ions apparently residing in the c-domain of the protein (see Section 3.6). Although wheat Ec-1 has the ability to bind six 113CdII ions, only five resonances can be clearly identified in the spectrum. All peaks are in the usual range for 113CdII ions in the tetrahedral tetrathiolate coordination environment of CdII­thiolate clusters (700À600 ppm) [31]. In principle, chemical shifts for isolated 113CdNS3 sites would be found in the same range, while mononuclear 113CdN2S2 sites have been reported between $500 and $400 nm [31]. However, no other resonances were observed when scanning the chemical shift range from 880 to 100 ppm. The 113Cd NMR spectrum of 113Cd4C-Ec-1 shows only three peaks (Fig. 3B) while four resonances were expected. Their positions at 694.7, 686.1, and 655.8 ppm correspond to the resonances at 694.0, 685.6, and 655.3 ppm in the spectrum of the full-length 113 Cd6Ec-1, which allows the clear assignment of the latter peaks to the C-terminal domain in the full-length protein. This finding further demonstrates that the chemical environment of at least three of the four CdII ions in C-Ec-1 and in the full-length protein is very similar, once more indicating a large degree of independence of the C-terminal domain from the rest of the protein. Compared to the two most intense peaks in the 113Cd NMR spectrum of 113 Cd6Ec-1 at 659.5 and 661.2 ppm, the three peaks corresponding to the CdII ions coordinated to C-Ec-1 are broader and their integrals approximate only 15% of the area of the two intense peaks.

This is probably due to chemical exchange processes in C-Ec-1, a phenomenon already discussed for other MTs [32]. Although the three peaks exhibit a partially resolved fine structure, 113Cd-113Cd COSY experiments of either 113Cd6Ec-1 or 113Cd4C-Ec-1 do not reveal any cross peaks between these three resonances and thus do not allow the deduction of metal­thiolate cluster connectivities within the C-terminal domain. However, cross peaks between the two intense resonances at 659.5 and 661.2 ppm in 113Cd6Ec-1 can be observed corroborating the presence of a MIICys6 cluster in the 2 c-domain (Fig. 3C). 3.4.

Similar to the titration performed with C-Ec-1 (see below), a number of species with different metal ion-to-protein ratios was detected already after the addition of the first equivalent of CdII (Figs. 4A and 5A). Assuming isostructural replacement of ZnII ions by CdII and hence also retention of the overall complex charge, the intensity of signals observed in the spectra is expected to reflect the species distribution in solution To evaluate the observed species distribution for signs of cooperativity or to identify especially stable species, a comparison with a statistical distribution was performed according to

Even though T. aestivum Ec-1 has been purified from natural sources as a ZnII-binding protein [4], substitution reactions with CdII may provide important information about structural features and properties of this metallothionein. Replacement of ZnII ions in Zn6C-Ec-1 was performed with addition of increasing amounts

Fig. 5. Schematic representation of species observed during the titration experiments of Zn6Ec-1 (A), Zn4C-Ec-1 (B), and Zn2c-Ec-1 (C) with increasing amounts of CdII (1À7 equiv., black columns). Zn2c-Ec-1 was obtained by proteolytic digestion of Zn6Ec-1. The broader grey columns indicate the statistical species distribution expected according to calculations with Eq. (1). The y-axes of the plots show the relative intensity of mass peaks observed in the ESI-MS spectra in %. Note the different intensity scale of some of the plots to improve readability.

between the species distribution observed and the statistical distribution reveals as the most apparent feature a continuous overpopulation of species with higher amounts of CdII ions than theoretically expected, e.g. formation of a Zn3Cd3Ec-1 species already after the addition of 1 equiv. of CdII, and accordingly an underpopulation of species with lower amounts of CdII ions, e.g. the complete lack of Zn5CdEc-1 after the addition of 2 equiv. of CdII. Apparently, the formation of a species such as Zn5CdEc-1 is in some way less favorable than the formation of e.g. Zn2Cd4Ec-1. Interesting to note is also on the one hand the early formation of species with seven metal ions, i.e. ZnCd6Ec-1 and Cd7Ec-1, while on the other hand a small amount of Cd6Ec-1 is still observed even after addition of 7À9 equiv. of CdII. An in-depth comparison of the ratio of MII to 7À MII species based on the intensity of signals observed in the MS 6À spectra, however, has to be exercised with caution as both, the complex structure as well as its ionisation, is likely to be changed. Nevertheless, it is unexpected to observe small amounts of ZnCd6Ec-1 in the spectra of samples that were supplemented with excess of CdII. This finding points to the presence of a binding site with somewhat increased affinity for ZnII. The fact that full-length Ec-1 is able to coordinate seven divalent metal ions went undetected in our metal ion substitution reactions performed earlier and followed by UV spectroscopy as addition of

more than 6 equiv. of CdII to Zn6Ec-1 did not lead to a further increase of the S?CdII LMCT band at 250 nm [12]. Treatment of Cd7Ec-1 containing samples with Chelex100Ò resin selectively removes one CdII ion to give Cd6Ec-1 (see also Section 3.4 below). Hence, the seventh metal ion is obviously more weakly bound than the other six and additionally, coordination of this seventh metal ion seem to require other ligands than Cys residues. It should be noted that coordination of a seventh metal ion is, under the experimental conditions applied, restricted to CdII. No Zn7Ec-1 species was observed upon treatment of Zn6Ec-1 with excess ZnII. 3.5. Metal ion substitution reactions with Zn4C-Ec-1 In a similar experiment as described above ZnII ions in Zn4C-Ec-1 were replaced with increasing amounts of CdII (0À7 equiv.) and ESIMS spectra recorded (Fig. 4B). Also here, a number of species with different metal ion-to-protein ratios is formed already upon addition of the first equivalent of CdII (Figs. 4B and 5B). A comparison of the observed species distribution with a distribution based on statistical probabilities reveals as the most striking differences (i) the overpopulation of the Zn2Cd2 state after the addition of 1 and 2 equiv. of CdII, (ii) the overpopulation of the ZnCd3 state after the addition of 2 and 3 equiv. of CdII, (iii) the total lack of a Zn3Cd spe-

cies after the addition of 2 equiv. of CdII, and (iv) a roughly 1:1 ratio of Cd4C-Ec-1 and Cd5C-Ec-1 even after addition of 7 equiv. of CdII, although, as noted above, quantification of MII and M II species 4À 5À based on signal intensities observed in MS spectra has to be considered with caution. Concluding, the formation of the Zn3CdC-Ec-1 form appears to be less favorable than the formation of Zn2Cd2CEc-1, ZnCd3C-Ec-1, and Cd4C-Ec-1. Detection of a Cd5C-Ec-1 species is particularly interesting as it allows the conclusion that the coordination of the seventh metal ion observed during the substitution of ZnII ions by CdII in Zn6Ec-1 can be assigned to the C-terminal part of the protein. In contrast, incubation of Zn4C-Ec-1 with 4 equiv. of ZnII only leads to the formation of a small amount of Zn5C-Ec-1. Nevertheless, also incubation of Cd4C-Ec-1 with additional CdII leads only to approximately 50% formation of Cd5C-Ec-1, which is again in accordance to the experiment described above for fulllength Ec-1. Also the fifth metal ion in Cd5C-Ec-1 can be selectively removed with Chelex100Ò resin (see also below in the same section). CD spectra recorded for Cd4C-Ec-1 and Cd5C-Ec-1 differ significantly in their elliplicity envelopes in the LMCT region and hence a pronounced influence of the fifth metal ion on the metal­ thiolate cluster structure of this domain is evident (Fig. 6). The CD spectrum reported previously for Cd6Ec-1 [12] shows greater similarities to the CD spectrum of Cd5C-Ec-1 than to the spectrum of Cd4CEc-1. Either the coordination of a seventh CdII ion was overlooked or the presence of a certain amount of the C-terminal DTTadduct (see Section 3.2) influenced the CD spectrum accordingly. The presence of two highly conserved His residues is certainly one of the main features that distinguishes the Ec protein subfamily from e.g. the vertebrate MTs, and assuming participation of these His residues in metal ion-binding could help to explain the observed ability of C-Ec-1 to accommodate a fifth metal ion. However, it is probably not that simple as the known preference of His ligands for ZnII would contrast the observation that only minor amounts of additional ZnII ions can be coordinated. In addition, similar metal ion titration experiments performed with the a-domain of human MT2, which contains 11 Cys residues in analogy to C-Ec-1 but no His residues, revealed the same tendency to bind a fifth CdII ion but no additional ZnII ions [33]. However, the ability of human a-MT2 to bind an additional CdII ion is not reflected in metal ion reconstitution experiments of the full-length rabbit MT1 and MT2 species studied with ESI-MS [21]. Rabbit MT3, how-

ever, exhibits higher stoichiometries, i.e. up to 12 ZnII or 13 CdII ions instead of the usually found seven ZnII or CdII ions. As already pointed out above, differences in the charge distribution states are observed in the m/z spectra of Zn4C-Ec-1 and Cd4C-Ec-1, which is an indication that the two species exhibit certain conformational differences. Elucidation of these differences might be the key in understanding the coordination of the fifth metal ion in Cd5C-Ec-1. In order to examine the relative binding stability of the fifth metal ion, samples of Cd5C-Ec-1 were incubated with Chelex100Ò resin for different amounts of time ranging from 10 min up to 5 h and re-analysed by ESI-MS (spectra not shown). The experiment revealed that the fifth CdII ion was released within the first 10 min while the resulting Cd4C-Ec-1 species was stable against Chelex100Ò even after 5 h incubation. These results indicate that the apparent stability constant of the additional binding site must be lower than the apparent stability constant of the CdII-Chelex100Ò complex, which was estimated to be $104.6 MÀ1 (see Section 2.8 for details). Also the seventh CdII ion in the full-length Cd7Ec-1 species was removed by the chelating resin in less than 10 min (data not shown) while again, the resulting Cd6Ec-1 form was stable against removal of further metal ions even after longer incubation times in presence of the chelator. 3.6. Proteolytic digestion of Zn6Ec-1 after titration with CdII ions To gain deeper insights into the substitution reaction of ZnII ions by CdII, e.g. assignment of substituted metal ions to the c- or C-terminal domain, titration of Zn6Ec-1 with increasing amounts of CdII was repeated, this time including a limited proteolytic digestion step prior to the recording of ESI-MS spectra. For the digestion experiment the specific endopeptidase trypsin was used, which cleaves at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine and arginine, except when either of them is followed by proline [34]. Ec-1 contains seven potential trypsin cleavage sites (Fig. 7A), two of them within the c-domain, one in the linker region between the c-domain and the central Cys-rich region, and four cleavage sites within the C-terminal domain, more precisely in the linker region separating the central and the C-terminal Cys-rich regions. The limited proteolytic digestion experiments performed previously with proteinase K showed the preservation of metal­thiolate cluster structures in MTs even after partial backbone cleavage of the cluster forming peptide sequences [12,35,36]. Trypsin-digested Ec-1 samples were analysed with ESI-MS both at pH 7.5 and 2.5. This allows the determination of the number and sort of metal ions coordinated to the protein fragments based on the mass differences observed between the two spectra. Fig. 7B shows the predominating peptide fragments found in the ESI-MS spectra of the digested samples (Fig. 7C). No metal ions were found to be associated with the peptide fragments belonging to the C-terminal part of Ec-1 (II and IIIa­c in Fig. 7B) in any of the spectra. Apparently, cleavage of the linker region connecting the central and C-terminal Cys-rich regions leads to a significant destabilization of the metal ion-binding motiv present and impedes any further investigation of the order of metal ion substitution in the C-terminal domain of the digested sample. Fragment I corresponds to the intact N-terminal cysteine-rich c-domain of T. aestivum Ec-1 [12]. Peaks corresponding to the mass of this fragment associated with two metal ions, ZnII and/or CdII, could be detected in all spectra acquired at pH 7.5 enabling the observation of the metal ion exchange reaction in this part of the protein (Fig. 5C). Upon addition of the first equivalent of CdII to Zn6Ec-1 and subsequent digestion, a larger amount of the ZnCdcEc-1 species was observed than expected for a purely statistical distribution of metal ions between the binding sites. The same is true for the formation of Cd2c-Ec-1 after the addition of 2À5 equiv. of CdII. After addition of the second equivalent of CdII, no more

Zn2c-Ec-1 was present. Surprisingly, a small amount of the ZnCdcEc-1 species was still observed even after addition of 7 equiv. of CdII. Likewise, during the titration of Zn6Ec-1 with CdII (Fig. 5A), also the ZnCd6Ec-1 species was still observed after addition of 7 equiv. of CdII. Hence, this finding suggests that the ZnII ion in ZnCd6Ec-1, which is apparently bound with relatively higher affinity, is coordinated within the c-domain. Even in the presence of 7 equiv. of CdII, ZnII is obviously still capable of competing with CdII for this binding site. 3.7. Reconstitution of apoEc-1 with ZnII The deconvoluted spectrum of apoEc-1 protein recorded at pH $ 7.5 (inset in Fig. 8A) reveals a mass of 7704 ± 2 Da corresponding to the oxidized protein containing four disulfide bridges. It was even possible to follow the oxidation process during the acquisition of the ESI-MS spectra. The simultaneous mass deconvolution during data acquisition showed a decreasing mass from 7712 Da down to 7704 Da within approximately 1 min. It is thus evident, that oxidation of the protein took place rapidly during the time needed for the ESI-MS measurements, but did not already occur during sample handling inside the nitrogen-purged glove box. This is an important observation, as oxidation during the metal ion reconstitution reaction would severely influence the metal ion coordinating abilities of the protein. The peak at 7739.5 ± 2 Da corresponds to the oxidized apo-form plus 2 NHþ 4 ions, and the following peaks originate from further NHþ adducts. 4 Replacement of protons by NHþ ions from the ammonium acetate 4 buffer used is a common effect in ESI-MS measurements [37]. As expected, the addition of increasing amounts of ZnII to apo Ec-1 leads to a shift of the peaks in the ESI-MS experiment towards higher masses due to metal ion-binding. In addition to this shift, at each point of the reconstitution, multiple species with different ZnII-to-protein ratios can be detected (Fig. 8B). Again, also the sta-

tistical distribution of metal ions is shown. However, in contrast to the ZnII?CdII exchange experiments discussed in the previous three sections only a qualitative evaluation of the MS data is justified, as the structures of the substoichiometrically metal ionloaded forms as well as their overall charges are not comparable. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that after addition of 1 equiv. of ZnII already Zn2Ec-1 species are observed next to apo- and ZnEc1, while upon addition of 2, 3, or 4 equiv. of ZnII only species with a maximum of 2, 3, or 4 ZnII ions bound, respectively, can be detected. This suggests that formation of Zn2Ec-1 proceeds with a certain degree of cooperativity. Addition of 5 equiv. of ZnII ions results in species with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 ZnII ions but no Zn5Ec-1 species is observed. Spectra, taken up to the addition of 9 equiv. of ZnII do not reveal any new species besides the relatively intense, fully metal ion-loaded Zn6Ec-1 form and lower intensity signals of Zn4Ec-1. 3.8. Average ZnII binding motifs in Zn6Ec-1 and Zn4C-Ec-1 Both EXAFS spectra, the one for full-length Zn6Ec-1 as well as for the truncated Zn4C-Ec-1 form are dominated by the backscattering of the sulfur ligands in line with the presence of metal ion-binding cysteine residues. The automated EXAFS analysis procedure, ABRA, highlights as the best refinement with semi-integer coordination numbers 4 sulfur ligands for Zn6Ec-1 and 3.5 sulfur ligands and 0.5 light ligands, summarizing imidazole groups and oxygens atoms, for Zn4C-Ec-1. These results are in accordance with the meta-analysis of other models yielding slightly worse fit results. In more detail, alternative models (Table S1) without light ligands (N or O) identify average sulfur contributions of 3.8(2) and 3.5(2) for Zn6Ec-1 and Zn4C-Ec-1, respectively. Thus the presence of light ligands is required to saturate the tetrahedral ZnII coordination sphere. Structural ZnII binding sites are typically formed by cysteine and histidine groups. The presence of the later group improves the refinement. Alternative models with oxygen replacing

Best models with average numbers (N) of ligand atoms (L), their distance to the metal ion (R), the respective Debye-Waller factor (2r2), the Fermi energy for all shells (EF), and the fit index (U), indicating the quality of the fit are shown. The total error is estimated to 0.02­0.03 Å for first shell distances and 0.05­0.1 Å for the other more remote backscatterers. The coordination number in EXAFS data analysis has a typical error of about 20%. In order to lower the number of parameters in the restrained refinement, distances and Debye-Waller factors for ligands of the same coordination sphere were refined jointly as indicated by superscripts (b­d).

In the refinement small His contributions improved the fit. In the Fourier transform only the first shell contribution is easily visible: For Zn6Ec-1 a tiny shoulder at 1.9 A (not fully phase corrected distance) reflects the average contribution by 0.2 His. In Zn4C-Ec-1 this contribution is refined to 0.5 His resulting in a small shoulder at the same distance and also in weak interferences in the EXAFS at about 8­10 ÅÀ1. Moreover, for this sample the experimental Fourier transform peak maximum is slightly lower (49.7 vs. 50.9), in line with a smaller number of sulfur ligands on average. The simulated signals (dashed lines) are drawn superimposed to the experimental data (solid lines), respectively.

mary, the small histidine contributions to the EXAFS signal can be roughly quantified to 0.2 ± 0.1 ligands per ZnII ion for the fulllength protein and 0.5 ± 0.1 ligands for the truncated protein. This average metal contribution corresponds very well to 2 His/22 Cys ligating groups for 6 ZnII ions in Zn6Ec-1 and 2 His/14 Cys ligating groups for 4 ZnII ions in Zn4C-Ec-1. Whereas the jointly refined first shell Debye-Waller factors have been determined with high accuracy, the higher error margins for Debye-Waller factors of the second and third shell imidazole contributions reflect their relative small percentage in the average coordination. All details on the average ZnII binding motifs are provided in Table 2 and the corresponding refinements are shown in Fig. 9.

4. Conclusions The results presented show that the recombinantly expressed C-terminal domain of T. aestivum Ec-1 preserves its metal ion-binding ability even in the absence of the N-terminal c-domain of the full-length protein. Especially results from the 1D 113Cd NMR spectra underline the self-sufficiency of C-Ec-1 with respect to the rest of the protein. A detailed investigation using mass spectrometry performed on both, the full-length Ec-1 as well as its C-terminal domain, demonstrates differences in the maximum binding stoichiometries for ZnII and CdII ions. When exposed to an excess of CdII, Ec-1 species with six as well as seven metal ions were observed. The coordination of the seventh metal ion occurs UV-silent, i.e. coordination of this additional metal ion does not lead to a further increase of the S?CdII LMCT band. On the one hand, other amino acids than Cys, such as e.g. glutamic acid, might serve as ligands for the additional CdII ion. On the other hand, it can be also envisioned that formerly terminal Cys ligands of the Cd6Ec-1 form contribute to binding and become bridging, which indeed would not lead to a significant increase of the absorption intensity. Contrarily, one would also expect to observe a concomitant red shift of absorption bands indicating an increased cluster size, but such a shift is absent in the corresponding spectra [12]. Since the N-terminal c-domain proved not to be able to bind more than two metal ions as evident from the digestion experiments presented here, the seventh CdII binding site must consequently be located within the C-terminal domain. Indeed, incubation of Cd4C-Ec-1 with additional CdII leads to the formation of a Cd5C-Ec-1 form. It cannot be excluded at this point that histidine residues may play a role in this expanded CdII binding capacity. However, according to the principle of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) His, as well as Glu, residues should prefer coordination of ZnII ions over CdII ions, but no additional ZnII binding was observed in Zn6Ec-1, and only minor amounts of Zn5C-Ec-1 were detected with ESI-MS upon addition of excess ZnII ions to Zn4C-Ec-1. Further, EXAFS measurements performed on Zn4C-Ec-1 and Zn6Ec-1 reveal participation of His residues in both cases. Results are in agreement with a model considering coordination of the four ZnII in the C-terminal domain by the two His residues and by all 11 Cys, and hence no His residues would be available as ligands for binding of the additional metal ion unless a rearrangement of the structure takes place. Conformational differences between the ZnII- and the CdIIforms might actually indeed provide an explanation for the differential behaviour of Ec-1 towards these two metal ions, as suggested by the differences in the charge distribution states in the respective m/z spectra. Not finally resolved is the question whether coordination of the additional metal ion by the C-terminal part of the protein plays a role in dimerization. While the equal signal intensity for Cd4- and Cd5C-Ec-1 species in Fig. 5B after the addition of six or seven CdII ions suggests the stoichiometric formation of a dimer with a total of nine CdII ions bound and a low stability under the conditions of the ESI-MS experiment, the low intensity of the signal for

Cd6Ec-1 compared to Cd7Ec-1 in Fig. 5A does not corroborate this view. Gel filtration experiments performed on Cd4C-Ec-1 in the presence of excess CdII ions (Supplementary material) reveal the presence of small amounts of dimer, which is converted into the monomer after treatment with the metal ion chelator Chelex100Ò. Again it is not clear, if only a small amount of dimer is formed or if the dimer is also partially unstable under the conditions of the chromatographic experiment. The titration experiments further show a relative low cooperativity in the replacement reaction of ZnII by CdII ions, which is not unexpected considering the preformation of the metal­thiolate cluster structure by ZnII. Proteolytic digestion of Zn6Ec-1 samples titrated with increasing amounts of CdII allowed the investigation of the metal ion exchange reaction taking place in the c-domain and revealed that a small amount of ZnII remains bound even after addition of an excess of CdII ions. This observation is an indication for the presence of either a binding site with increased ZnII affinity or a sterically less accessible site. Proposing a Zn2Cys6 cluster analogous to the one observed in the yeast transcription factors GAl4 and PPR1 [38,39], the question arises, whether the increased stability of ZnII binding might point to a similar structure stabilizing role of the metal ions as in the transcription factors and to a function of the c-domain in DNA recognition processes. However, the highly conserved Cys pattern and amino acids of the yeast transcription factors differ significantly from the c-domain sequence. Hence, further investigations to identify potential binding partners of Ec1 are necessary. EXAFS measurement provided clear evidence that the two conserved His residues located in the C-terminal part of the protein, CEc-1, are indeed participating in the coordination of ZnII ions. As His ligands have been shown to confer characteristic features to metallothioneins, for instance an increased specificity for ZnII and decreased oxidation sensitivity due to the lower amount of Cys residues required [40], this finding might be one of the key points to understand the function of Ec-1 in vivo. Given that the proposed function of Ec-1 is ZnII storage or homeostasis during embryogenesis [5], characterization of its metal ion-binding properties allows a closer look into the mechanism and role of Ec-1 in the control of this metal ion in wheat germs. Specifically, the titration of apoEc-1 with ZnII ions provides insight into the cluster formation process in the living cell. The fact that the fully metal ion-loaded form Zn6Ec-1 is not exclusively formed and apparently also without high cooperativity, i.e. signals for Zn6Ec-1 only appear with the addition of the fifth equiv. of ZnII, is consistent with the hypothesis that sub-stoichiometrically metal ion-loaded Ec-1 species may exist in vivo and are important for the biological function of this metallothionein. MTs have already been shown to be able to transfer metal ions to apo-enzymes [41], receptors [42], and transcription factors [43]. The stability of sub-stoichiometrically metal ion-loaded Ec-1 species suggests a certain conservation of the three-dimensional (cluster) structure. This, as well as the likelihood that non-metal coordinated thiol ligands might persist in the reduced form in the reducing environment of the cell, could be key points for the reversibility of the metal ion release process, i.e. that wheat Ec-1 is not simply a metal ion storage protein but also able to regulate enzyme activity by withdrawing and delivering metal ions from and to the enzymatic active sites.
