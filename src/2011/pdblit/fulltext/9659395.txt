Abstract Crystals of K-momorcharin (MMC) were cross-linked and soaked in an 80% acetonitrile^water mixture and X-ray data î were collected to 2.2 A resolution. MMC is a ribosome-inactivating protein with a sugar chain on Asn-227. In previous studies, the whole conformation of the sugar chain could not be obtained in the aqueous system. Here the structure of MMC in a low water system is shown to be similar to the native one, but the sugar chain on Asn-227 is defined by the electron density map. Several oxygen atoms of the oligosaccharide formed intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the protein moiety. The conformation of the residues in the active center is similar to that in the aqueous system. Our results show conformational alteration of the tetrasaccharide of MMC in organic media. They indicate that the oligosaccharides are more rigid in organic solvents. X-ray determination in organic media may be used to solve some structures of oligosaccharides linked to glycoproteins. ß 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction In the last decade, non-aqueous enzymology has been an active area of biotechnological research [1,2]. In organic solvents, enzymes not only retain catalytic activity [3,4], but also exhibit completely new properties compared with those in water [5^7]. It is necessary to carry out structural studies of enzymes in organic solvents to understand and explore the explanation of this new phenomenon. Up to now, X-ray crystal structures of several enzymes in organic solvent have been determined, including subtilisin in acetonitrile [8^10] and dioxane [11], elastase in acetonitrile [12], lysozyme [13] and concanavalin A [14]

in acetonitrile, L-trypsin in cyclohexane [15], Q-chymotrypsin [16,17] and triosephosphate isomerase [18] in hexane. In the aforementioned studies, the overall enzyme structures are similar to those in aqueous solution, except for the reorientation of some side chains. The solvent structures have some alteration, and some small organic molecules bind on the protein surface. The binding pockets of small molecules may give some information for rational or structurebased drug design [19]. The reorientation of side chains and speci¢c solvent interactions near the active center may be responsible for the alterations of enzymatic catalysis in organic media. In previous researches, it was found that enzymes were less active in organic solvents than in water [20]. One of the reasons for the diminution of enzymatic activity in organic media is a reduced conformational mobility. Other biochemical properties of enzymes, such as pH memory and enhanced thermostability,

also indicate that protein structures tend to be `more rigid' in limited water as compared to aqueous media [4]. In organic solvents, the dielectric constant at the protein surface is lower, and the hydration of the residues on the surface is restrained. The polar residues on the surface tend to construct more hydrogen bonds with each other. Some water molecules, acting as lubricants or plasticizers, are lost or replaced by organic solvent molecules. This causes the enzyme to be more rigid in organic media, as proved by crystal structures [8,16]. Molecular dynamic simulation also supports that proteins are more rigid due to the increased hydrogen bonding network and salt bridges in organic solutions [21,22]. We have reported the crystal structure of a complex of trypsin in cyclohexane. Its disordered peptide chain is more ordered and could be de¢ned with an electron density map [23]. In the present study, K-momorcharin (MMC) was chosen to study the disordered oligosaccharide in a low water system. MMC is a single-chained ribosome-inactivating protein isolated from the seeds of the bitter gourd Momordica charantia [24] and is a glycoprotein with N-linked oligosaccharides on Asn227 [25]. The X-ray structures of MMC and its complex have been studied in several labs [26^28]. However, the oligosaccharide might be disordered in aqueous solution, so the conformation of the whole sugar chain was not determined. The present study shows the structure of cross-linked MMC crystals in an 80% acetonitrile^water mixture. Four oligosaccharide rings of the sugar chain are well de¢ned in the electron density map. The ¢nal re¢ned coordinates and structure factors of this work have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, www.rcsb.org (entry codes: 1f8q and r1f8qsf). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Crystal preparation MMC was isolated and puri¢ed at the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Science. Crystals were obtained at 22³C by the hanging-drop vapor di¡usion method. The hanging drops contained 9 Wl protein solution and 6 Wl reservoir solution, and the volume of reservoir solution was 1 ml. The protein was dissolved in 5 mM HAc^

NaAc bu¡er (pH 4.1) in the presence of 3 mM ATP, to a concentration of 14 mg/ml. The reservoir solution was 20 mM Tris^HCl bu¡er containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 (purchased from Sigma) at pH 7.12. The cross-linked solution was prepared by mixing 25% aqueous glutaraldehyde (purchased from Sigma) with the reservoir solution in di¡erent v/v ratios. Single crystals (about 0.4U0.3U0.3 mm) were incubated in 1 ml 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 12 h and then in 5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h. The crystals were washed with distilled water and a mixture of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile^water, six times each. Crystals were then soaked in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile^water for 30 min and were sealed in siliconized thin-walled glass capillaries. 2.2. Data collection and reduction Di¡raction data sets were collected at 22³C on an R-AXIS IIC imaging plate area detector using CuKK radiation from a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray generator operating at 40 kV and 100 mA. Intensity data were then integrated, scaled, and reduced to structure factor amplitudes with Rigaku data processing software on an SGI workstation [29]. The crystals belong to space group R3 with unit cell paî rameters a = b = 131.51, c = 39.81 A, K = L = 90³, Q = 120³. From two crystals 11 526 (85.2% completeî ness) unique re£ections (I s c(I)) to 2.2 A resolution were collected. The Rmerge (de¢ned as g(MI3GIfM)/gI) of all signi¢cantly measured data is 0.056. 2.3. Re¢nement Native MMC (PDB entry 1MRI) without water molecules as starting model was subjected to rigid î body re¢nement using 8^3 A data with X-PLOR 3.1 [30]. The rigid body re¢nement resulted in R = 0.270 and the rotation angle and translation vector were 0.17³, 30.26³, 30.27³, 0.18, 0.35, 0.00 respectively. The program Turbo-Frodo [31] was used for model building on the basis of 2Fo 3Fc and Fo 3Fc Fourier maps. The model of the sugar chain on Asn-227 was then built according to the omitFourier map. After the sugar chain was built, conventional energy-restraint crystallographic re¢nement and simulated annealing procedures were carried out using the standard protein and carbohydrate topol-

ogy and parameter libraries. Solvent molecules, modeled as water, acetonitrile and glutaraldehyde, were inserted at stereochemically reasonable positions. The parameter and topology ¢les of acetonitrile and glutaraldehyde were generated with XPLO2D [32]. Finally, only positional and temperature factor re¢nement were applied. The free R factor was used to monitor the re¢nement process and avoid over¢tting [33]. The re¢nement results are summarized in Table 1. 3. Results The crystals of MMC complexed with ATP were cross-linked by glutaraldehyde and then soaked in a series of concentrations of an acetonitrile^water mixture. Crystals soaked in 90% acetonitrile or neat acetonitrile lost their di¡raction ability in several minutes. Like lysozyme [13], the crystals could regain their original di¡raction ability after they were back-soaked from acetonitrile to water. However, the back-soaking time should be long enough, for example, several hours. The crystals could di¡ract X-rays to high resolution in 85% acetonitrile or lower. 3.1. Description of the overall structure The overall conformation of MMC in an 80% acetonitrile^water mixture is essentially the same as in aqueous solution. The CK traces of MMC in acetonitrile and native MMC (PDB: 1MRI) are depicted in Fig. 1. The rmsds of backbone and side chain

shifts in atomic positions between the two coordinate î sets are 0.09 and 0.20 A, respectively. The largest deviation of backbone atoms between MMC and î 1MRI is more than 3 A, which occurs at the external loop residue 217^221, connecting two antiparallel L-sheets. In aqueous solutions, this external loop seems highly disordered [27]. In 80% acetonitrile, the electron density map of the loop is well de¢ned as shown in Fig. 2, though the atoms of the loop still have a high temperature factor. 3.2. Active site In MMC complexed with ATP in aqueous solution, it was found that adenine, as the hydrolytic product of ATP, existed in the active center. Adenine interacts with ribosome-inactivating proteins so

strongly that it cannot di¡use into the environment easily, terminating the hydrolytic reaction in aqueous systems [27]. The active center of MMC in acetonitrile was checked carefully by omit map and no Fo 3Fc electron density exceeding 2 c ¢tting adenine was found. We re¢ned the structure of MMC with adenine added, and negative di¡erence Fourier density occurred around adenine. This indicates that no adenine exists at the catalytic pocket of MMC, which may be caused by the di¡erence of adenine solubility in water and in acetonitrile. Although the biochemical properties of MMC in organic media have not been reported until now, we surmise that the catalytic ability may be altered due to solvent e¡ects. The orientation of the residues which take part in catalysis, such as Tyr-111, Glu-160 and Arg-163, did not change obviously. The side chain of Tyr-70, which acts as a valve to control the opening and

closing of the active center to the solvent area, has a small torsion angle (about 50³) compared with 1MRI (Fig. 3). The water molecules bound in the active center are conserved both in acetonitrile and in water. 3.3. Conformation of tetrasaccharide The MMC molecule contains a sugar chain which is bound to Asn-227. The N-linked oligosaccharide contains three components, which have the same sequence as the main chain: Xyl(L2)-Man(L4)GlcNAc(L4)-GlcNAc, except for the presence and absence of fucosyl and mannosyl residues in the branched chains [28]. In aqueous solutions, the oligosaccharide is di¤cult to recognize. In the Protein Data Bank, there are three coordinate sets of native MMC in di¡erent conditions, two of which, 1MRI

[27] and 1AHC [25], do not contain the oligosaccharide structure. The other one, 1MOM, has two oligosaccharide rings. Electron density is visible for the ¢rst N-acetylglucosamine, but the density is weaker for the second ring [26]. In the structure of MMC in acetonitrile, the tetrasaccharide of the main chain is identi¢ed by a di¡erence Fourier map (Fig. 4), and two branched rings cannot be recognized. The sugar chain is located in the 2Fo 3Fc electron density map above 1.0 c after re¢nement (Fig. 4). Unlike 1MOM, residue 301, N-acetylglucosamine bonded to Asn227, adopts a boat conformation, instead of the conventional chair conformation. Residue 301 forms several hydrogen bonds with the protein moiety, which are not observed in 1MOM [26]. The hydrogen bonds formed by the oligosaccharide are summarized in Table 2. The other N-acetylglucosamine

(residue 302) and the mannose (residue 303) have a chair conformation. The xylose (residue 304) adopts a skew conformation [34]. Several intramolecular interactions are found (Table 2), which make the sugar chain more rigid. The orientation of the sugar chain could be illustrated by torsion angles P and i between two oligosaccharide rings [35]. The torsion angles of glycosidic bond are listed in Table 3. Oligosaccharides are very £exible in aqueous solution. The sugar ring can rotate around P and i in a wide range. In the crystal structure, the N-linked oligosaccharides are surrounded and hydrated by abundant water, just as in aqueous solution. So the N-linked oligosaccharides are always disordered in the crystal structure. In a low water system, desolvation causes an insu¤cient number of water molecules to hydrate the sugar chain. The dielectric constant of the environment decreases much due to the presence of the organic medium. The sugar chain tends to

Torsion angles of L4 linkages are de¢ned by four atoms as follows: P = O5(i)-C1(i)-O4(i-1)-C4(i-1), i = C1(i)-O4(i-1)-C4(i-1)C3(i-1). For L2 linkage, P = O5(i)-C1(i)-O2(i-1)-C2(i-1), i = C1(i)-O4(i-1)-C2(i-1)-C1(i-1). For residue 301, P = O5-C1-ND2(227)-CG(227).

form more interactions with proteins and more intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which reduce the £exibility of the oligosaccharide. The oligosaccharide is more rigid and ordered in a low water system than in water, accordingly in crystallography, it shows more integrity in the electron density map. To avoid accidental error, we collected two sets of di¡raction data using two crystals, and after primary re¢nement, we obtained similar electron density maps. Here we presented the results of re¢nement using the data after the two sets were merged. 3.4. Solvent structure Only two acetonitrile molecules were modeled in MMC in 80% acetonitrile. Fewer acetonitrile molecules were observed in the aqueous^organic mixture than in the neat organic solvent as reported previously [10]. Acetonitrile 305 (Fig. 5) with its N atom î interacts with water molecule 339 (2.77 A). This water molecule also forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain oxygen atom of Asp-1 and water molecule 340. The acetonitrile molecule is located in a hydrophobic hole formed by residues Asp-1, Ala-42, Glyî 45, and Tyr-47. The C1 atom of acetonitrile is 3.33 A from the O atom of Gly-45. The other acetonitrile molecule, 306, is found in crystal contact. Its N atom î is 3.39 A from the guanidinium nitrogen atom of Arg-97. Acetonitrile 306 occupies the hydrophobic region formed by Gln-93, the side chain of Arg-97 and Tyr-94, and symmetry-related residue Leu-201. Three glutaraldehyde molecules are identi¢ed between the symmetry-related enzyme molecules. All

three glutaraldehyde molecules have well-de¢ned electron density, and occupy the cleft formed by symmetry-related molecules. However, no bond between lysine and glutaraldehyde is found in electron density. Ninety-six water molecules are found in the structure in 80% acetonitrile. Among them, 42 water î molecules are conserved (within 1.5 A) with 1MOM. 4. Discussion The sugar chains of glycoproteins play an important role as cell^cell recognition signals in multicellular organisms, and lectins are their partners in these events [36]. However, the sugar chain on the protein surface always has a £exible conformation except when it binds with lectin as substrate. So it is di¤cult to obtain the three-dimensional structure of N-linked oligosaccharides by common structural studies. In the Protein Data Bank, most structures of glycoprotein do not contain a sugar chain or only involve an incomplete sugar chain. Though some glycoprotein structures contain a sugar chain, the electron density map of the oligosaccharides is not clear and integral. Preparation of the complex of glycoprotein and lectin is a good way to study biochemical properties and structures, but the crystal of the complex for X-ray studies is always di¤cult to obtain. Our experiment shows that the sugar chain of MMC is identi¢able according to the density map in organic medium. There are more hydrogen bonds between the N-linked oligosaccharides and the

protein part of the glycoprotein, suggesting that the energy of interaction is used to restrict the conformation of the oligosaccharides. In aqueous solution, the sugar chain may hydrate with plenitudinous water molecules, which weaken the interaction between the protein and the oligosaccharide. So desolvation makes the N-linked oligosaccharides of MMC more ordered and more rigid in organic media compared with aqueous solution, which is consistent with molecular dynamics simulations and the biochemical properties of enzymes in organic solvents. When the complex glycoprotein^lectin is formed, the solvent molecules also come away from the binding area. This indicates that the e¡ect of desolvation is important for the conformation of the oligosaccharide. Xray structural determination in organic media may be used as a method to solve the disordered oligosaccharide moiety in the future.
