ABSTRACT: Three paths for obtaining crystals of reduced (II-E4Q/I-K258R) cytochrome ba3 are described, and the structures of these are reported at 2.8-3.0 Å resolution. Microspectrophotometry of single crystals of Thermus ba3 oxidase at 100 K was used to show that crystals of the oxidized enzyme are reduced in an intense X-ray (beam line 7-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory), being nearly complete in 1 min. The previously reported structures of ba3 (Protein Data Bank entries and ), having a crystallographically detectable water between the CuB and Fea3 metals of the dinuclear center, actually represent the X-ray radiation-reduced enzyme. Dithionite-reduced crystals or crystals formed from dithionite-reduced enzyme revealed the absence of the above-mentioned water and an increase in the CuB-Fea3 distance of 0.3 A. The new structures are discussed in terms of enzyme function. An unexpected optical absorption envelope at 590 nm is also reported. This spectral feature is tentatively thought to arise from a five-coordinate, low-spin, ferrous heme a3 that is trapped in the frozen crystals.

In respiring organisms, cytochrome c oxidase catalyzes proton translocation coupled to the reduction of O2 to water (1, 2). Cytochrome ba3 oxidase is one of two hemecopper oxidases isolated from Thermus thermophilus (3). It contains the dinuclear CuA center; a six-coordinate, low-spin (6cLS)1 heme B; and a (usually) five-coordinate, high-spin (5cHS) heme As in the proximity of CuB (refs 3 and 4 and references cited therein). The latter (heme As and CuB)

constitute the bimetallic site, and it is widely agreed that dioxygen binds to this site as the first step in O2 reduction and proton pumping. Two crystal structures of native and recombinant, oxidized ba3-type cytochrome c oxidase have been determined at <2.5 Å resolution (5, 6). However, the structure of reduced cytochrome ba3 oxidase has not been reported. Oxidized and reduced forms of cytochrome c oxidase represent two important intermediates in its catalytic cycle, and one might expect differences in their structures. In particular, the reduced enzyme should be structurally prepared to bind O2 (7, 8). However, such structures obtained so far for the A1-type (9) enzymes indicate very small, if any, changes near the redox centers (10-12). Reported structures of both redox states from cytochrome aa3 of Paracoccus denitrificans also revealed essentially no changes at 3.0-3.3 Å resolution (10), while in the case of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (also of the aa3 type, and at a higher resolution), a redox-linked conformational change was observed in a surface loop (13) not present, for example, in cytochrome ba3. We recently reported the structure of a doubly mutated form of cytochrome ba3 (II-E4Q/I-K258R) that forms robust

Accelerated Publications crystals in just a few days due to a new lattice contact (14). This form of the enzyme is used throughout this work to examine properties and structures of the chemically reduced enzyme. By recording optical absorption spectra from single crystals before and after exposure to the X-ray beam, we gained new information about the redox state of the two hemes. Small but significant, and possibly important, structural changes were detected around the Fea3-CuB dinuclear center. These changes, observed for defined spectroscopic states, support a direct, as opposed to an indirect (15), mechanism for the B-type oxidases (see ref 7). The structures provide important new information about how the enzyme functions. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization. The mutant (II-E4Q/I-K258R) cytochrome ba3 oxidase from T. thermophilus was expressed and purified as previously described (14, 16) and used throughout this study. Detergent exchange was conducted using DEAE resin (GE Science) in Econo-Column (Bio-Rad) (14). The purified protein sample was eluted and concentrated in 13 mM n-nonyl -Dglucopyranoside (2 × CMC) in 10 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0) with 0.1 M KCl. The oxidized protein was crystallized under the same conditions as the recombinant wild type (6). Crystals ranged from 250 to 400 µm along their largest dimension. The concentration of enzyme within the unit cell is 6 mM. To crystallize reduced mutant cytochrome ba3, 5-10 mM sodium dithionite (Sigma, La Jolla, CA) was used. Moreover, all solutions used in the experiment were degassed, and the entire crystallization-archiving procedure was conducted in a glovebox at <1 ppm O2 (COY Laboratory Products Inc.) filled with a gas mixture of 10% hydrogen and 90% nitrogen. Single-Crystal Microspectrophotometry. Absorbance spectra of crystals mounted in an Oxford cryo-stream operating at 100 K were recorded using either an in-house system based on an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer or a modified 4DX system (17) installed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on beamline 7-1, which utilizes an Ocean Optics QE65000 spectrometer. All crystals were exposed to degassed cryoprotectant, typically 50% methylpentanediol, for 10 s before being cryocooled and before the spectra were recorded. In the X-ray radiationinduced reduction experiments, crystal orientation was chosen to produce a satisfactory spectrum, and this was maintained in subsequent measurements. Spectral figures were prepared using IgorPro. X-ray Data Collection. Where indicated, the cryoprotectant used previously (14) was supplemented with sodium dithionite (10 mM). This level of reductant was included to prevent oxidation of the enzyme during the time that the crystals were being transferred to liquid nitrogen. All data sets were collected on beamline 7-1 at SSRL at 100 K, a wavelength of 0.979 Å, and an approximate total flux of 1 × 1013 photons/min. Structure Determination and Refinement. All diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM and SCALA [CCP4 suite (18)]. The wild-type, recombinant structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1XME) was the initial model for molecular replacement with PHASER (19). The determined structures

were then refined using rigid refinement and further restrained refinement with REFMAC 5.0 (20). For all data sets, 5% of the reflections were randomly selected to provide a test set for Rfree calculations (21). Water molecules were placed in at least three  positive peaks in the Fo - Fc map and refined. Structure models and electron density maps were displayed with COOT (22). Coordinates of Fea3 and CuB were refined against the anomalous difference data with MLPHARE (18) to independently determine the distance between them (f ) 0.3 eand f ) 1.5 e- for Fe; f  ) 0.0 e- and f ) 2.2 e- for Cu at 0.979 Å). The SCALA mtz files containing |F+| and |F-| to the resolution limit of each data set were used with a 6F cutoff. The observed standard deviation of the coordinate shift of the Fea3-CuB sites is very small for each data set, with the estimated error for the metal-metal distance being approximately (0.03 Å. However, the metal-metal distances vary from data set to data set, i.e., different crystals, and for this reason, they are reported only to the first decimal place (see Table SI_1 of the Supporting Information). Refinement of Xe and Kr positions within ba3 was carried out in a similar manner (see ref 8). VOIDOO (23) was utilized to compute the O2 channel to include the cavity formed in the dinuclear site in the reduced structure (grid for plot files, 0.7 Å; probe radius, 1.0 Å). Figures were created using PyMOL (24). Details of data collection statistics and final refinement statistics are given in Table 1. RESULTS Crystals of reduced cytochrome ba3 suitable for X-ray diffraction studies can be obtained (A path) by treatment of crystals of the oxidized, as-isolated protein with a cryoprotectant solution containing excess dithionite followed by a plunge into liquid nitrogen, (B path) by X-ray irradiation of crystals of oxidized protein maintained in a cryostream, and (C path) by growth of crystals of the dithionite-reduced protein in an anaerobic environment prior to being frozen in liquid nitrogen. Optical absorption spectra of crystals so obtained are shown in Figure 1 (A, B, and C paths), and

Spectra were recorded as described for the A path using the Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer. Spectral figures were created with IgorPro.

spectra of a solution of ba3 are shown in the lower portion of Figure 1C; more extensive solution spectra are presented in refs 3 and 25. Optical Absorption Spectra of Single Crystals. Crystals formed from the as-isolated enzyme and maintained at 100 K in a cryostream exhibit a broad, generally featureless optical absorption spectrum [cyan traces in Figure 1 (A, B, and C paths)] comparable to spectra recorded in solution at room temperature (cyan trace, lower set, Figure 1, C path). The broad absorption band at 780 nm, cyan trace for the B path in Figure 1, probably arises from the oxidized form of the weakly absorbing CuA center, although this feature is not observed in all crystals of the as-isolated enzyme that we have examined. A Path. When a crystal of oxidized enzyme at room temperature is exposed to a cryoprotectant solution containing 10 mM dithionite for 10 s prior to being frozen in

liquid nitrogen, its optical spectrum shows distinct features that are reasonably assigned to the 6cLS ferrous heme b, 528 and 558 nm (Figure 1 A path). In addition, an intense but unexpected absorption envelope appears near 587 nm. B Path. As shown by the blue and red traces for the B path in Figure 1, a crystal of the as-isolated, oxidized enzyme, maintained in a cryostream at 100 K, becomes reduced upon exposure to the X-ray beam. Exposure for as little as 1 min (see Experimental Procedures) caused the appearance of the sharp absorption bands (527 and 557 nm) due to the 6cLS ferrous heme b, and exposure to the beam for an additional 5 min caused only a modest (20%) further increase in these absorption bands. Here again, the unexpected 590 nm band is also seen, but probably because the bands appear sharper in this configuration (see Experimental Procedures), it has a shoulder at 585 nm. C Path. Spectra of crystals obtained from the dithionite-

The distance between Fea3 and CuB, which is 4.7 Å in crystals of the asisolated protein (B path), increases to 5.1 and 5.0 Å in reduced crystals (A path) and in crystals grown from the chemically reduced protein (C path), respectively. The shorter 4.7 Å distance of the B path structure is comparable to the 4.4 Å distance obtained previously from higher-resolution structures that were studied under different conditions (Table SI_1 of the Supporting Information, and Protein Data Bank entries 1XME and 1EHK). In the structures reported here, the greater Fea3-CuB separation results mainly from movement of the Fea3 atom out of the plane of the porphyrin toward the NE2 atom of I-His384, while the CuB atom remains in its original position (Figure 2). This movement of the Fea3 atom is accommodated and perhaps even caused by shortening of the I-His384 NE2-Fea3 interaction by 0.3 Å in the A and C path structures, suggesting that I-His384 and CuB are anchored in protein space while the Fea3 atom can move along the normal to the heme plane. Such differences may find their origin in the chemistry that is occurring in the reaction chamber (see, for example, ref 7). Note that in the structure of cytochrome aa3 of Rhodobacter sphaeroides reported by Qin et al. (26) there appear to be two O atoms in the asisolated enzyme. The other significant finding is that the water molecule residing between CuB and Fea3 in the B path structure (Figure 3B and Protein Data Bank entries 1EHK and 1XME) is no longer present in either structure of chemically reduced ba3 (A and C paths, Figure 3A,C). A 2Fo - Fc map (at 1, not shown) indicates no connection between the two metals. Figure 3B shows the |Fo| - |Fc| map (at 4) indicating the presence of a strong water peak in the dinuclear center of the X-ray radiation-reduced structure (i.e., B path). The |Fo| - |Fc| maps for the A and C path structures also show no significant features between the Fea3 and CuB sites. These data indicate that an O atom resides between CuB and Fea3 in the oxidized, as-isolated structure, but they do not reveal the metal to which this atom is coordinately bonded prior to radiation reduction (see Discussion). DISCUSSION Recent studies with other heme proteins (see refs 27-29 and references cited therein) have provided evidence for spectral and/or structural changes induced by intense X-ray radiation. The chemical, spectral, and structural results described here for Thermus cytochrome ba3 can be understood in terms of the following. First, crystalline, oxidized cytochrome ba3 can be fully reduced by a short incubation in a buffered cryosolution containing 10 mM Na2S2O4, or alternatively, crystals can be formed from the reduced protein in dithionite-containing mother liquor and maintained O2free. Second, because electrons formed during X-ray photolysis of water (27) are strongly reducing, it might have been expected that synchrotron-derived X-ray beams, with their high photon flux, would result in reduction of the metal centers of cytochrome c oxidases (30-32). However, as shown in the C path of Figure 1, the X-ray beam does not significantly alter the heme chromophores beyond the level

FIGURE 2: Superimposition of binuclear site structures of T. thermophilus cytochrome ba3 in oxidized, as-isolated crystals (magenta, reduced by the B path) and in crystals grown from chemically reduced protein (C path, yellow). The two structures were superimposed using COOT and then displayed with PyMOL. Additional metric data are given in Table SI_1 of the Supporting Information.

reduced enzyme, cryocooled in liquid nitrogen and examined at 100 K, also exhibited strong absorption bands due to reduced heme b (527 and 557 nm), relatively weak absorption near 585 and 590 nm, and yet a new and stronger band near 608 nm (Figure 1, C path). We were concerned that additional exposure to X-ray radiation would cause further changes in the optical spectrum. However, beyond the possible emergence of a broadband at 630 nm, this did not occur, indicating that one-electron reduction is not followed by, for example, further reduction of the porphyrin -system (Figure 1, C path). With this concern allayed, we determined the structures of the two, chemically reduced forms of cytochrome ba3, i.e., those obtained by A- and C paths, and compared them to the structure resulting from the B path. X-ray Crystallographic Structures. The root-mean-square (rms) differences among the structure of ba3 in chemically reduced crystals (A path), crystals of the as-isolated protein (B path), and crystallized reduced protein (C path) are on the order of 0.3 Å. A few residues located on the surface of the protein show slightly larger deviations, because they reside in flexible loops. No significant change was observed at the CuA, CuB, or heme b metal. However, small changes do occur in and around the dinuclear site (Figure 2). These include movement of the Fea3 atom as well as possible changes in the interaction between the guanidinium group of I-Arg449 and the D-ring propionate of heme a3, while the interaction between the A-ring propionate O1D and ND1 of I-His376 is unchanged. Further work is required to determine if these small changes are important to the enzyme's mechanism. To avoid bias in restrained refinement and more accurately determine the distance between iron and copper atoms, anomalous difference maps were created (Figure 3a-c). At high contour levels (4), these illustrate the shift in metal positions. The Fea3-CuB distances were derived by refining coordinates of the two atoms against the anomalous scattering data (see Experimental Procedures). Metric comparisons of

inclined to undergo change at 100 K. This is particularly important following the B path. If the radiation-induced reduction of metal centers leads to unstable reduced states, e.g., those having a high affinity for protons (see ref 7 for

Each path for obtaining reduced, crystalline ba3 leads to overall similar structures. However, each form is spectrally distinct, and therefore, at some level, it must also be structurally different. Heme a3 and CuB, forming the O2 reduction/H+ pumping site, must pass through numerous electronation and protonation states during catalysis (7, 36, 37). Small structural changes will be outside the current resolution, but they are likely to be important in enzyme function. Two real differences between chemical and radiation reduction are movement of Fea3 away from CuB by 0.3 Å and loss of the inter-metal O atom. These changes are likely to be mechanistically important because they prepare the reaction chamber to bind an O2 molecule. Reduction of the metals leads to an increase in the volume of the reaction chamber and causes the appearance of apposing, open-coordination positions on those metals, which appear perfectly evolved to bind O2 and reduce it to a bridging peroxo dianion (see ref 100 of ref 7). As summarized in Table SI_1 of the Supporting Information, a similar CuB-Fea3 distance change also occurs in A1-type oxidases. As might be expected, the O2 channel (8) should extend to include the space between Fea3 and CuB, which is the ultimate binding site for dioxygen. Figure 4 shows the VOIDOO representation of this extended channel with a blue sphere to mark the penultimate O2-binding site (the Xe1 position described in ref 8). Finally, the nature of the inter-metal O atom in the oxidized protein is potentially of great mechanistic importance because its position and protonation state (O2-, HO-, or H2O°) will affect the overall charge and the distribution of charge throughout the active site (7).

a review), then movement of these within the protein may create forces that are resisted under these conditions, thereby resulting in nonequilibrium structures. In contrast, when crystals are exposed to dithionite at room temperature, the metal centers may relax to the states observed along the A or C path. Applying these facts and concepts allows a tentative interpretation of both spectral and structural data. Spectral Changes. Upon chemical reduction of the enzyme in solution, all sites will be reduced [CuA, heme b, and the CuB-Fea3 dinuclear center (3, 16, 25, 33)], and each heme will exhibit a unique absorption spectrum. Heme b is a typical 6cLS electron carrier, known to be in rapid redox equilibrium with CuA (25). Its unique optical spectrum serves as a sensitive indicator of enzyme reduction, and its features are similar in crystals obtained along each path as well as in solution (Figure 1, C path). By contrast, heme a3 contributes unique, path-dependent spectra in the form of the 585 and 590 nm envelope in all crystalline forms, and the 608 nm peak observed in C path crystals. Absorption of light at 590 nm is commonly observed with the 6cLS forms of ferrous heme a3 such as its CO (34) and CN- complexes (35). However, all the structures reported here clearly demonstrate the absence of a sixth ligand to Fea3. Hence, the 590 nm envelope cannot be due to a 6cLS ferrous heme a3. Although the reason for a spin change is not known, we tentatively propose that a 5cLS electronic configuration of ferrous heme a3 is responsible for the 585 and 590 nm envelope in all the crystal forms. Such an unusual electronic configuration could result from structural trapping at 100 K. It is important to note that these optical transitions have been observed only at low temperatures in the crystalline state. Crystals from the C path, however, exhibit rather little 585 and 590 nm absorption compared to A and B path crystals but instead have a significant band at 608 nm. We suggest this represents the 5cHS electronic configuration of
