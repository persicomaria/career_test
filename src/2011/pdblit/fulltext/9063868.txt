The MutT enzyme (129 residues) catalyzes the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) by substitution at the rarely attacked -P, to yield NMP and pyrophosphate. It requires two divalent cations, forming an active E-M2+-NTP-M2+ complex. The solution structure of the free enzyme consists of a five-stranded mixed -sheet connected by loop I-R-helix I-loop II, by two tight turns, and by loop III and terminated by loop IV-R-helix II [Abeygunawardana, C., et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 1499715005]. Assignments of backbone 15N and NH resonances and side chain 15N and NH2 resonances of the quaternary complex were made by 1H-15N HSQC titrations of the free enzyme with MgCl2 followed by equimolar AMPCPP/MgCl2. HR assignments were made by 1H-15N 3D TOCSY HSQC, and 1H-13C CT-HSQC spectra and backbone and side chain 1H and 13C assignments were made by 3D HCCH TOCSY experiments. Ligands donated by the protein to the enzyme-bound divalent cation, identified by paramagnetic effects of Co2+ and Mn2+ on CO(C)H spectra, are the carboxylate groups of Glu-56, -57, and -98 and the amide carbonyl of Gly-38. The solution structure of the complex was computed with XPLOR using a total of 2168 NOE and 83  restraints for the protein, 11 intramolecular NOEs for bound Mg2+AMPCPP, 22 intermolecular NOEs between MutT and AMPCPP, and distances from the enzymebound Co2+ to the three phosphorus atoms of Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP from paramagnetic effects of Co2+ on their T1 values. The fold of the MutT enzyme in the complex is very similar to that of the free enzyme, with minor changes in the metal and substrate binding sites. The adenine ring binds in a hydrophobic cleft, interacting with Leu-4 and Ile-6 on -strand A and with Ile-80 on -strand D. The 6-NH2 group of adenine approaches the side chain NH2 of Asn-119. This unfavorable interaction is consistent with the stronger binding by MutT of guanine nucleotides, which have a 6-keto group. The ribose binds with its hydroxyl groups oriented toward the solvent and its hydrophobic face interacting with Leu-4, Ile-6, and the -CH2 of Lys-39 of loop I. The metal-triphosphate moiety appears to bind in the second coordination sphere of the enzyme-bound divalent cation. One of two intervening water ligands is well positioned to attack P with inversion and to donate a hydrogen bond to the conserved residue, Glu-53, which may deprotonate or orient the attacking water ligand. Lys-39 which is positioned to interact electrostatically with the R-phosphoryl group may facilitate the departure of the leaving NMP. On the basis of the structure of the quaternary complex, a mechanism of the MutT reaction is proposed which is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with kinetic and mutagenesis studies. It is suggested that similar mechanisms may be operative for other enzymes that catalyze substitution at P of NTP substrates.

ABSTRACT:

The MutT enzyme, a pyrophosphohydrolase of 129 residues, catalyzes the unusual hydrolysis of nucleoside and deoxynucleoside triphosphates (NTP) by nucleophilic substitution at the rarely attacked -phosphorus, yielding py This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants DK28616 (to A.S.M.) and GM18649 (to M.J.B.).

rophosphate and a nucleotide (NMP) as products (Bhatnagar et al., 1991; Weber et al., 1992a). Like other enzymes which catalyze substitution at the electron-rich -phosphorus, this enzyme requires two divalent cations for activity (Frick et al., 1994). The biological role of this enzyme is to prevent AT f CG transversions (Yanofsky et al., 1966) by preferentially hydrolyzing a mutagenic form of dGTP which mispairs with template A, thus "sanitizing" the nucleotide pool (Bhatnagar et al., 1991, and references therein). Maki and Sekiguchi (1992) have proposed that the biological substrate of the MutT enzyme is 8-oxo-dGTP, an oxidatively modified nucleotide which can mispair with template adenine during DNA synthesis in Vitro (Cheng et al., 1991), and have characterized a similar enzyme from a human cell line (Mo et al., 1992; Sakumi et al., 1993) and from mice (Kakuma et al., 1995). The MutT enzyme is part of a larger family of sequence-related phosphohydrolases which appear to serve a "housecleaning" function in cells (Bessman et al., 1996).

Lin et al. NTP substrate with the enzyme, we have determined the solution structure of the quaternary MutT-M2+-AMPCPPM2+ complex, using AMPCPP which was previously shown to be a nonhydrolyzable substrate analog for MutT (Frick et al., 1994; Lin et al., 1996). The structure of the quaternary complex leads directly to a reasonable and testable mechanism of the MutT reaction which may also apply to other enzymes that catalyze nucleophilic substitution at P of NTP substrates. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Uniformly isotopically enriched compounds, including 15NH4Cl (99% 15N), D2O (99.996% 2H), and glucose (99% 13C), were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Labs (Woburn, MA). AMPCPP was purchased from Sigma. The MutT enzyme, labeled with 13C and/or 15N, was isolated and purified as previously described (Abeygunawardana et al., 1993) and was assayed with dGTP as substrate, as previously described (Frick et al., 1994). The sample conditions for the NMR studies of the MutTMg2+-AMPCPP-Mg2+ complex were 0.75 mM labeled MutT, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 16 mM MgCl2, and 8 mM AMPCPP, in H2O/D2O (90:10) for the 15N-labeled protein or in D2O for the 13C/15N-labeled protein. NMR Spectroscopy. Unless otherwise noted, NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Unityplus 600 spectrometer equipped with four independent RF channels and Z gradient capabilities at 32 °C using the Nalorac 8 mm triple-resonance, pulsed field gradient probe and a 22 mm sample column (850 µL) in Shigemi 8 mm NMR tubes. All multidimensional data sets were recorded using the StatesTPPI method (Marion et al., 1989) in all indirect dimensions, with a relaxation delay of 1.0-2.0 s. In some NMR experiments, the original pulse sequences were modified to include gradient pulses and water flip-back pulses in order to minimize artifacts and to avoid saturation of the water resonances (Table 1). NMR experiments used for protein resonance assignments, i.e. 2D 1H-13C CT-HSQC and 3D HCCH-TOCSY experiments, as well as for intramolecular NOE studies, i.e. 3D 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC and 3D 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC spectra, were acquired as described previously for the free enzyme, and the parameters are given in Table 1 (Abeygunawardana et al., 1995). 3D COCH experiments, which correlate side chain carbonyl carbon resonances (13CidO) with 13Ci-1 and 13Ci-2 resonances and those of protons attached to the Ci-1 carbon, were acquired with the pulse sequence of Kay (1993). All 13C pulses were applied at 43 ppm, and the refocusing delay, d, was set to 0.9 ms to optimize correlations for side chain methylene groups. All other parameters were as described (Kay, 1993) (Table 1). Intermolecular NOEs between protons of AMPCPP and those of the 13C/15N-labeled MutT enzyme in D2O were acquired using the 13C-filtered NOESY-HMQC sequence of Lee et al. (1994) with mixing times of 400 ms and 1 s. To improve the sensitivity, experiments were carried out as two sets of 2D spectra, rather than as one 3D experiment, with frequency labeling of either 13C-bound proton resonances or the attached 13C resonances of the enzyme (Table 1). The long mixing times were necessary to accumulate sufficient signal, because the binding of AMPCPP to the MutT enzyme

Numbers in parentheses indicate residues at the beginnings and ends of the secondary structural components. This lowest-energy structure, drawn with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), shows CR connectivities. Due to few NOE restraints, the side chain conformations of E44, E56, and E98 are not well-defined.

Heteronuclear NMR1 studies of MutT have shown the solution secondary structure to consist of a five-stranded mixed -sheet connected by the loop I-R-helix I-loop II motif, by two tight turns, and by loop III and terminated by loop IV-R-helix II (Abeygunawardana et al., 1993; Weber et al., 1993). The tertiary structure (Figure 1, Abeygunawardana et al., 1995) is globular and compact, with the parallel portion of the -sheet sandwiched between the two R-helices, forming an R+ -fold. A cluster of four conserved glutamate residues (53, 56, 57, and 98) form a patch of strongly negative electrostatic potential in the three-dimensional structure. Previous mutagenesis and structural studies have shown that Glu-57 provides one of the ligands to the enzyme-bound divalent cation (Lin et al., 1996). Other possible ligands, suggested by the proximity of the enzyme-bound metal to their backbone NH groups, include the carboxylate side chains of Glu-53, Glu-56, and Glu-98 and the amide carbonyl groups of Gly-38 and Lys-39. Nucleotide binding altered backbone 15N and NH chemical shifts along -strands A, C, and D of the -sheet and at the beginning of helix II, suggesting that the cleft region (Figure 1) contributes to the substrate binding site. To clarify these points, and to learn in detail the sites of interaction of the essential divalent cation and the metal1 Abbreviations: AMPCPP, R, -methyleneadenosine triphosphate; CT, constant time; DGSA, distance geometry-simulated annealing; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum correlation; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; 2D, two-dimensional; 3D, three-dimensional; RF, radiofrequency; TES, N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; TPPI, timeproportional phase incrementation; TSP, sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4.

Co2+ and Mn2+ Titrations of the MutT Enzyme. To determine the ligands of the enzyme-bound divalent cation, 2D CO(C)H experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence described above (Table 1) with 0.75 mM 13C/15Nlabeled MutT enzyme, 10 mM TES buffer (in the CoCl2 titrations), or 10 mM Tris buffer (in the MnCl2 titrations) (pH 7.5) in D2O (without AMPCPP and MgCl2) in the presence of either 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 µM CoCl2 or 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 µM MnCl2. Data were collected using samples volumes of 0.65 mL in a 5 mm tripleresonance, pulsed field gradient probe. All data sets were processed on Silicon Graphics workstations (Indigo2XZ or Personal IRIS 4D/35) using the FELIX software package (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). The observed 1H chemical shifts are reported with respect to the H2O or HOD signal, which is taken as 4.706 ppm downfield from extermal TSP at 32 °C. The carbon chemical shifts are reported with respect to external TSP in D2O (0.0 ppm). The nitrogen chemical shifts are reported with respect to external 15NH4Cl (2.9 mM in 1 M HCl) at 20 °C, which is 24.93 ppm downfield from liquid NH3 (Levy & Lichter, 1979). The phosphorus chemical shifts are reported with respect to 85% H3PO4 containing 20% D2O. Paramagnetic Effects of Enzyme-Bound Co2+ on the Phosphorus Atoms of AMPCPP in the Quaternary MutTCo2+-AMPCPP-Co3+(NH3)4 Complex. To ensure the binding of paramagnetic Co2+ only to the enzyme site, and not to the nucleotide site, the substitution-inert, diamagnetic, stable complex, ,-bidentate Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP, was used in place of MgAMPCPP. It was prepared, purified, and characterized by 31P NMR as previously described (Cornelius et al., 1977; Cleland & Mildvan, 1979; Granot et al., 1980b). A solution containing 0.5 mM MutT, 2.40 mM Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP, 1.3 mM Tris-HCl-d11 buffer (pH 7.5), and 10% D2O in a total volume of 2.0 mL at 20 °C was titrated with CoCl2 at concentrations of 0, 24, 73, 147, 220, and 293 µM, monitoring the longitudual relaxation rates (1/T1) of the 31P resonances of Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP at 242.9 MHz with a Bruker AM 600 NMR spectrometer, equipped with a 10 mm broad band probe. To minimize the recycle time, the nonselective saturation-recovery method, with 8-10 relaxation delays, was used to measure T1, as previously described (Serpersu et al., 1988; Weber et al., 1991). For each spectrum, 16K data points were collected over a spectral width of 10 000 Hz with an acquisition time of 0.8192 s. Four scans per spectrum were generally sufficient to obtain adequate signal:noise, i.e. >10:1. To permit calculation of the correlation time for dipolar interaction, the T1 values were also measured at 101.3 MHz on selected samples from the titration, at CoCl2 concentrations of 0, 73, and 293 µM, using a Bruker AM 250 NMR spectrometer. For each spectrum, 4K data points were collected over a spectral width of 5000 Hz with an acquisition time of 0.4096 s. Depending on the concentration of CoCl2, 128-1024 scans per spectrum were required to obtain adequate signal:noise. Conditions were otherwise as described at 242.9 MHz. The data were analyzed as previously described (Serpersu et al., 1988) by plotting the increase in 1/T1 for each 31P

Lin et al. resonance as a function of the total concentration of added Co2+. The slopes of these linear plots, when multiplied by the total concentration of Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP, yielded 1/fT1P, the normalized longitudual relaxation rates. These values were then corrected for the fraction of Co2+ which was present in the quaternary complex, estimated as 38% from a consideration of the distribution of Co2+ among three forms: the free ion, the binary MutT-Co2+, and the quaternary MutT-Co2+-AMPCPP-Co3+(NH3)4 complexes. This distribution was calculated from the dissociation constant of Co2+ from the quaternary complex of 25 ( 9 µM as determined by competition with Mn2+ binding which was monitored by EPR and by 1/T1P of water protons at 24.3 MHz, as previously described (Serpersu et al., 1988; Weber et al., 1991), and from the KI of Co(NH3)4AMPCPP in the Co2+-activated MutT reaction of 3.7 mM, as determined by standard kinetic assays in competition with Mg2+dGTP (Frick et al., 1994). The corrected values of 1/fT1P were then used, with the dipolar term of the Solomon-Bloembergen equation, to calculate Co2+-31P distances in the quaternary complex, as previously described (Mildvan & Gupta, 1978; Serpersu et al., 1988; Weber et al., 1991). Structural Calculations. The NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, and weak and assigned distance restraints of 1.8-2.8, 1.8-3.2, and 1.8-5.0 Å, respectively (Clore et al., 1986). Pseudoatom corrections were added to the upper limit for constraints involving NOEs to methyl protons (1.0 Å), to nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons (1.0 Å), to degenerate methyl protons of Leu and Val residues (1.7 Å), and to  and  protons of Tyr and Phe residues (2.3 Å) (Wuthrich et al., 1983; Wuthrich, ¨ ¨ 1986; Clore et al., 1987). Using 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC data, an additional 0.5 Å was added for NOEs involving methyl protons to account for their higher apparent intensities, resulting from slower relaxation. Only structurally useful intraresidue NOEs were included in the interproton distance restraints. Thus, NOEs between geminal protons or between vicinal methylene protons were not used. 3JNH-HR values were interpreted and incorporated as torsional angle () restraints where  ) -60 ( 20° for 3JNH-HR < 6.0 Hz and  ) -120 ( 40° for 3JNH-HR g 7.5 Hz. A total of 83  dihedral angle restraints from 3JNH-HR coupling constant measurements were used with a force constant of 200 kcal mol-1 rad-2. The structures of the quaternary MutT-M2+-AMPCPP2+ complex were calculated from randomized initial M structures using the hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing (DGSA) protocol (Nilges et al., 1988) in the program XPLOR 3.1 (Brunger, 1992) on a Convex C220 ¨ computer. A total of 2168 intramolecular and 22 intermolecular NOE-derived distance restraints were applied to the MutT enzyme and between the enzyme and AMPCPP, respectively. The conformation of AMPCPP in the complex was determined by using 11 intramolecular distance restraints and two dihedral angle restraints previously reported (Frick et al., 1995) using the error limits in the distances as the upper and lower limits for the restraints. The nucleotidebound metal was chelated by oxygen atoms of the - and -phosphates of AMPCPP in the  configuration as previously determined (Frick et al., 1994). The enzyme-bound metal was restrained by four metal ligands from oxygen atoms of the side chain carboxylates of Glu-56, Glu-57, and Glu-98 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly-38, as

Solution Structure of the MutT-M2+-AMPCPP-M2+ Complex found experimentally (see below), with a lower limit of 2.0 Å and an upper limit of 2.4 Å. In addition, two water ligands to the enzyme-bound metal with distance restraints of 2.02.4 Å were incorporated into the structure, on the basis of previous water relaxation studies with enzyme-bound Mn2+ (Frick et al., 1994; Lin et al., 1996). Distance restraints from the enzyme-bound metal to the three phosphorus atoms of AMPCPP were based on their experimental measurement by paramagnetic effects of enzyme-bound Co2+ on the 1/T1 values of each phosphorus of ,-bidentate Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP, a diamagnetic, substitution-inert, stable analog of Mg2+-AMPCPP. The structural calculations were made using a square-well potential and a force constant of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2. Using these restraints, a total of 40 structures were generated by the DGSA protocol. These 40 structures were then subjected to two rounds of refinement which yielded an ensemble of 16 energy-minimized structures which satisfied the criteria of no NOE violations of >0.5 Å and no dihedral violations of >5°. These 16 structures were used to define the tertiary structure of the MutT-Mg2+-AMPCPP-Mg2+ complex. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Backbone Chemical Shift Changes in the MutT-Mg2+AMPCPP-Mg2+ Complex. It was previously shown (Lin et al., 1996) that the binding of Mg2+ to MutT caused numerous changes in chemical shifts of backbone 15N and NH resonances of the enzyme along -strand A, -strand B, loop I (near Gly-38), helix I (near Glu-57), and loop III (near Glu-98). Additional chemical shift changes were observed upon the subsequent binding of Mg2+AMPCPP, especially along loop I. Because of these numerous changes, it was necessary to reassign the backbone and side chain chemical shifts in the MutT-Mg2+-AMPCPP-Mg2+ complex, to collect and interpret new NOE data, and to determine the solution structure of the MutT protein in the quaternary complex. The assignments of the backbone 15N and NH resonances were made by titration of the MutT enzyme with Mg2+ and then with AMPCPP-Mg2+, closely monitoring the changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The assignments of most of the side chain 1H and 13C resonances were made by 2D CT-HSQC and 3D HCCH TOCSY spectra and confirmed by 3D 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC experiments. The chemical shift assignments of MutT in the complex are given in the Supporting Information (Table 1S). The binding of Mg2+ and MgAMPCPP to the MutT enzyme to form the quaternary complex produced significant changes in chemical shifts of backbone CR and HR resonances along helix I, -strands A, C, and D, and loops I and III (Figure 1). The locations of these changes are consistent with those of backbone 15N and NH chemical shifts of MutT previously found on Mg2+ and nucleotide binding (Lin et al., 1996). These results suggest that the enzyme-bound metal binds near the conserved cluster of Glu residues in helix I, loop I, and loop III and that the metal nucleotide binds in the cleft between -strands A, C, and D and helix II (Figure 1).

The MutT enzyme has been shown to be activated by Mg2+ or Mn2+, with both ions forming an active quaternary E-M2+-NTPM2+ complex (Frick et al., 1994). Co2+ is also found to be

an effective activator of MutT. The kcat values are 3.96, 0.75, and 0.19 s-1 for Mg2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, respectively. All side chain carboxylate resonances except that of Glu53 (see below) were assigned from 3D COCH spectra (Kay, 1993) (Table 2S). To identify the ligands of the enzymebound metal, distance-dependent paramagnetic effects of Co2+ and Mn2+ on side chain carboxylate resonances and backbone carbonyl resonances of MutT were monitored by 2D CO(C)H spectra. These spectra correlate the chemical shifts of all carboxylate and carbonyl carbons with those of adjacent methylene or methine protons. The glutamate region of this spectrum which correlates the -carboxylate carbon with the -methylene protons revealed pairs of signals from each glutamate residue (Figure 2A) except for Glu-53, which remains undetected over the temperature range of 1441 °C and the pH range of 7.6-9.5. Correlation peaks for the -carboxylate carbon of Glu-53 were also not observed in the quaternary MutT- Mg2+-AMPCPP-Mg2+ complex (data not shown). All resonances of Glu-53 other than that of the -carboxylate carbon have previously been assigned in the free enzyme (Abeygunawardana et al., 1995) and have been reassigned in the MutT-Mg2+-AMPCPP-Mg2+ complex (Table 1S). The failure to detect correlations involving the -carboxylate, together with weaker correlations observed for the other side chain resonances of Glu-53, especially those involving the -methylene, suggest conformational heterogeneity of the side chain of this residue. Titration of 750 µM MutT with CoCl2 resulted in the attenuation of several carboxylate resonances, most notably those of Glu-56 and Glu-57 which become undetectable at a substoichiometric level of CoCl2 (25 µM) (Figure 2B) and Glu-98 which decreased to 43% of its initial intensity at 25 µM CoCl2 (panels B and C of Figure 2). These losses of signal intensity result from paramagnetic effects on 1/T2, broadening the resonances in both the carbon and proton dimensions, and from paramagnetic effects on 1/T1 which decouple the carbon from the proton signals (Villafranca & Mildvan, 1972). Under conditions of fast exchange, as established by the complete loss of signal intensities at substoichiometric levels of Co2+, these paramagnetic effects on relaxation are dominated by dipolar effects which are inversely related to r6, where r is the distance from Co2+ to the observed carbon and protons (Mildvan & Gupta, 1978). For quantitative comparisons of these paramagnetic effects, [Co2+]1/2 values, the concentrations of Co2+ which gave halfmaximal attenuation of these resonances, were calculated as 13 µM for Glu-56 and Glu-57 and 22 µM for Glu-98 (Figure 2C, Table 2). Comparably strong effects of Co2+ were detected on the amide carbonyl carbon of Gly-38 ([Co2+]1/2 ) 18 µM). Significantly weaker paramagnetic effects of Co2+ occurred on the resonances of Glu-41 ([Co2+]1/2 ) 36 µM) and Glu-44 ([Co2+]1/2 ) 90 µM), indicating greater distances of these residues from the enzyme-bound metal ion (panels B and C of Figure 2, Table 2). No other side chain carboxylates of Glu or Asp residues or carbonyl groups of Gln or Asn residues were significantly affected by Co2+. Because of the approximate linearity of these paramagnetic effects with [Co2+] (Figure 2C), and the essentially complete attenuation of all of the affected cross-peaks at saturating Co2+ concentrations, analysis of the initial slopes of these titration curves would yield the same relative distances as [Co2+]1/2.

The absolute effects of MnCl2 on 2D CO(C)H spectra of 750 µM MutT were greater than those of CoCl2 by more than 1 order of magnitude, although the relative effects of Mn2+ on individual resonances paralleled those of Co2+ (Table 2). As with Co2+, no other side chain carboxylates of Glu or Asp residues or carbonyl groups of Gln or Asn residues were significantly affected by Mn2+. The larger absolute effects of Mn2+ on 13C and 1H relaxation rates (Table 2) are due to its greater effective magnetic moment resulting from the fact that Mn2+ has five unpaired electrons while Co2+ has three. Mn2+ also has a 103-fold longer electron spin relaxation time than Co2+ which dominates the correlation time for dipolar interaction (Mildvan & Gupta, 1978).

It has previously been shown by mutagenesis, metal binding, and 1H-15N HSQC titrations that Glu-57 provides a ligand to the enzyme-bound divalent cation (Lin et al., 1996). The large and comparable paramagnetic effects of Co2+ (and Mn2+) on the carboxylate relaxation rates of Glu56 and Glu-57 indicate that Glu-56 is also a metal ligand. Glu-98 which is only slightly further from the metal probably provides a third ligand. Gly-38 is a likely fourth ligand as indicated by strong paramagnetic effects of both Mn2+ and Co2+ on the carbonyl carbon relaxation rates (Table 2) and of Mn2+ on the 1H-15N relaxation rates of the adjacent amide nitrogen of Lys-39 (Table 2, Lin et al., 1996). Somewhat weaker effects of Mn2+ on the 1H-15N relaxation rates of Gly-38 and Gly-37 are consistent with their greater distances from the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-38. The presence of two water ligands, which would complete the octahedral coordination of the enzyme-bound divalent cation, is consistent with the 17-fold-enhanced paramagnetic effect of enzymebound Mn2+ on 1/T1 of water protons (Frick et al., 1994). Intermolecular NOEs between AMPCPP and the MutT Enzyme in the Quaternary MutT-Mg2+-AMPCPP-Mg2+ Complex. The conformation of Mg2+AMPCPP in the quaternary complex has previously been determined as high anti-C2exo-O1endo, on the basis of 11 intramolecular interproton distances determined by transferred NOEs (Frick et al., 1995). Docking of Mg2+AMPCPP into the quaternary complex required not only its conformation but also intermolecular distances from assigned proton resonances of the enzyme to those of the nucleotide. These were determined by 2D 13C-filtered, isotope-edited NOESY experiments with 13C-enriched MutT. Frequency labeling of the 13C resonances, and of the 13C-bound proton resonances, in separate 2D NOESY experiments, yielded the 13C and 1H chemical shifts of groups on the enzyme which are in close proximity to the 12C-bound protons of Mg2+AMPCPP. A total of 22 intermolecular NOEs from assigned proton resonances of the enzyme to those of Mg2+AMPCPP were thereby obtained (Table 3).

The uncertainty in the C value results from the anisotropic g value of Co2+ which lies in the range of 4 ( 2. Errors (21%) are shown in the absolute distances which inlcude a 14% contribution from the anisotropic g values of Co2+ and a 7% contribution from experimental errors in the measurements of (1/fT1P)corr and c. The errors in the relatiVe distances (2%) result solely from errors in (1/fT1P)corr truncated by a factor of 6 because of the r6 relationship between (1/ fT1P)corr and distance.

From these NOEs, it is clear that the adenine ring binds in a hydrophobic environment near Leu-4 and Ile-6 of -strand A and near Ile-80 of the parallel -strand D. The ribose also interacts with Leu-4 and Ile-6 of -strand A as well as with Lys-39 on loop I. The methylene group between PR and P , corresponding to the site of bond cleavage in an NTP substrate, is near Gly-38, a likely ligand of the enzymebound divalent metal ion, and near Lys-39, a catalytic residue, the mutation of which to Gln results in a 42-fold decrease in kcat/KM (Frick et al., 1995). These intermolecular proximities are consistent with earlier phenomenological effects of NTP binding on backbone 15N and NH chemical shifts (Lin et al., 1996) which showed changes along -strands A, C, and D and loop I. Backbone chemical shift changes were also found on -strand B and at the amino end of helix II possibly due to more remote effects of NTP binding on the structure of MutT. Distances from the Enzyme-Bound Metal to the Phosphorus Atoms of the Metal-AMPCPP Complex. To position the triphosphate moiety of AMPCPP into the structure of the quaternary complex, distances from the enzyme-bound divalent cation to each of the three phosphorus atoms of the nucleotide were required. These were determined by paramagnetic effects of Co2+ on the 1/T1 values of PR, P , and P of the diamagnetic, substitution-inert complex, ,bidentate Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP bound to MutT. The proton-decoupled, 31P NMR spectrum of uncomplexed AMPCPP at pH 7.5, 20 °C, and 242.9 MHz shows three resonances: a doublet (2JP-P ) 9.0 Hz) at 21.50 ppm assigned to PR, a doublet (2JP-P ) 25.3 Hz) at -4.42 ppm assigned to P, and a doublet of doublets (2JP-P ) 25.5 Hz, 2J P-P ) 8.6 Hz) at 9.55 ppm assigned to P . On formation of the ,-bidentate Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP complex, the PR resonance shifts upfield (by 2.85 ppm) to 18.65 ppm, the P resonance shifts downfield (by 18.42 ppm) to 27.97 ppm,

and the P resonance shifts downfield (by 9.37 ppm) to 4.95 ppm. The marked deshielding at P and P establishes the formation of the ,-bidentate complex (Cornelius et al., 1977; Granot et al., 1980b). Titration of a solution containing MutT (0.50 mM) and Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP (2.40 mM) with CoCl2, as described in Materials and Methods, resulted in a linear increase in 1/T1 of each of the three phosphorus resonances with increasing Co2+ concentration (not shown). Table 4 lists the longitudual relaxation rates, (1/fT1P)corr, normalized to the concentrations of Co2+ and Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP and corrected for the concentration of Co2+ present in the quaternary MutT-Co2+-AMPCPP-Co3+(NH3)4 complex, at two frequencies, 242.9 and 101.3 MHz. The frequency dependencies of the (1/fT1P)corr values are consistent with them being in the fast exchange limit, permitting them to be used for distance calculations. The mean experimental ratio of [(fT1P)corr at 242.9 MHz]/[(fT1P)corr at 101.3 MHz] of 1.28 ( 0.13 (Table 4) yielded a dipolar correlation time of 2.2 ( 0.7 ps, a typical electron spin relaxation time of Co2+ (Serpersu et al., 1988; Weber et al., 1991). The Co2+phosphorus distances calculated from the (1/fT1P)corr values, using this correlation time, are given in Table 4. The relative distances, which are more accurate than the absolute distances because their errors result solely from the errors in (1/fT1P)corr, truncated by a factor of 6 due to the sixth root taken in the calculations, indicate that the enzyme-bound Co2+ is closer to the - and -phosphoryl groups of Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP than to the R-phosphoryl group. The absolute Co2+-31P distances, ranging from 6 to 8 Å, indicate that the Co3+(NH3)4AMPCPP complex binds in the second coordination sphere of the enzyme-bound divalent cation, rather than in the inner sphere which would yield Co2+phosphorus distances of 3.3 Å (Serpersu et al., 1988).2 An atypical location or conformation of the Co3+-nucleotide complex is unlikely since Co3+(NH3)4ATP is only 20-fold less active as a substrate than Mg2+ATP (Frick et al., 1994). While an underlying inner-sphere metal-nucleotide complex

cannot be totally excluded, it would have to exchange out of the enzyme at a rate much slower than the lowest (1/ fT1P)corr value of 13.5 s-1 to escape detection. Such a slowly dissociating metal-NTP complex would probably not be kinetically competent to participate in catalysis by the MutT enzyme since the KM values of Mg2+dGTP and Mn2+dGTP are comparable to their respective KD values, indicating rapid pre-equilibration of these substrates with the enzyme prior to their rate-limiting hydrolysis (Frick et al., 1994). Intramolecular Restraints for the Structure of the MutT Enzyme in the MutT-M2+-AMPCPP-M2+ Complex. Intramolecular NOE restraints for the MutT enzyme in the quaternary complex were determined by 3D 1H-15N NOESYHSQC and 3D 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC spectra. NOE peak lists were assigned on the basis of chemical shift data and converted into an XPLOR input file using an in-house-written computer program. The input file was subsequently edited manually to remove multiple possible assignments of NOEs
2 A second solution of the relaxation equation from the ratio of relaxation rates at two frequencies of 1.28 yields a dipolar correlation time of 0.32 ps, which is unprecedentedly short for Co2+ complexes (Mildvan & Gupta, 1978; Serpersu et al., 1988; Weber et al., 1991) and provides an extreme lower limit. If this short correlation time were correct, the absolute Co2+ to phosphorus distances would be shorter by 20% which is within their experimental errors given in Table 4. Hence, the conclusion of a second sphere complex would be unchanged.

resulting from chemical shift degeneracies. A total of 2168 intramolecular NOEs were assigned and used in the structure determination, of which 607 were long-range, 358 were medium-range, 586 were sequential, and 617 were intraresidue (Figure 3A). The NOEs were well distributed over the enzyme except for the first three residues at the N terminus, residues 25-28 of loop I, residues 92-102 of loop III, and residues 116-118 of loop IV. Also used in the structure determination were 83  dihedral angle restraints based on 3J 1 15 NH-HR coupling constants obtained from H- N HMQC-J experiments. All of the intermolecular and intramolecular distance restraints and the intramolecular dihedral angle restraints were used to calculate the structure of the quaternary MutTM2+-AMPCPP-M2+ complex using the standard simulated annealing protocol of XPLOR 3.1. A total of 16 acceptable structures of the complex were generated which are superimposed in Figure 4, and the input data and structural statistics are summarized in Table 5. The average rmsd values of the backbone and of all heavy atoms of the protein in the complex are low, indicating a well-defined structure (Table 4). The individual rmsd values for the backbone heavy atoms as a function of residue number correlate well with the number of NOE restraints (Figure 3A,B). The conformation of the triphosphate moiety of AMPCPP is less

precisely defined due to the fewer distance restraints available (see below). Structure of the MutT-M2+-AMPCPP-M2+ Complex. Figure 4 shows a superposition of the 16 acceptable structures of the quaternary MutT-M2+-AMPCPP-M2+ complex, and Figure 5 shows one of the two lowest-energy structures which most closely resembles the average structure. While the global fold of the MutT enzyme in the quaternary complex is very similar to that of the free enzyme, some localized structural differences were found. Thus, the mean pairwise rmsd between the free and complexed enzyme was 2.15 ( 1.16 Å for all backbone heavy atoms and 2.96 ( 1.48 Å for all heavy atoms. These values overlap with the

respective sums of the rmsd values for all backbone heavy atoms, separately calculated for the free and bound enzyme (2.01 Å) and for all heavy atoms, separately calculated for the free and bound enzyme (3.50 Å) indicating that much of the calculated difference results from variation within the structures of the free and complexed MutT. When this analysis was repeated for individual amino acids, it was found that the mean pairwise backbone rmsd values between the free and complexed enzyme for Ala-7, Gly-9, and Ile-10 of -strand A and for Asn-16 of turn I differed by more than two standard deviations over the sum of the rmsd values separately calculated for the free and complexed enzymes. Similarly, the mean pairwise rmsd values for all heavy atoms differed by more than two standard deviations for these same residues and also for Trp-90 and Trp-95 in loop III, indicating significant local conformational changes. These regions also show significant 15N and NH backbone chemical shift changes (Lin et al., 1996) but not CR or HR chemical shift changes on binding Mg2+ and Mg2+AMPCPP. Changes in mean pairwise rmsd values smaller than two standard deviations, but above the sum of those found separately in the free and bound enzyme, occurred throughout the enzyme in regions which also showed changes in backbone 15N and NH chemical shifts on binding Mg2+ and Mg2+AMPCPP (Lin et al., 1996) and are predominantly at the sites of metal and substrate binding. As expected, the magnitudes of these smaller changes in structure did not correlate quantitatively with the chemical shift changes and may not be statistically significant. Hence, at the present level of refinement, changes in 1H-15N HSQC spectra provide more sensitive tests of conformational changes than can be resolved by a statistical comparison of the structures of free and complexed MutT.

of Tyr-73 and Phe-75 located on -strand C, with these two aromatic residues forming a pocket to hold the adenine ring. On the other side of the cleft, the side chain amide NH2 of Asn-119 closely approaches the 6-NH2 group of AMPCPP (Figure 5) in all 16 acceptable structures, with a minimum interproton distance of 3.4 ( 0.5 Å averaged over the 16 acceptable structures. While this interproton distance exceeds the van der Waals sum of 2.4 Å by 1.0 ( 0.5 Å, electrostatic repulsion between these NH2 groups may occur, contributing to the 4.2-fold higher KM for adenine versus guanine nucleotides (Frick et al., 1995). With a keto group at the 6-position, guanine nucleotides would interact favorably with the NH2 of Asn-119. Two observations are consistent with the role of Asn-119 in substrate recognition by interacting with the 6-substituent of the purine ring. First, the side chain of Asn-119 is restricted by steric hindrance in a highly hydrophobic environment within 5 Å of Phe-35, Leu-71, Leu-82, Phe84, and Ala-118. The aromatic rings of Phe-35 and Phe-84 may explain the unusually wide separation by 1.89 ppm of the two side chain NH chemical shifts of Asn-119 in HSQC spectra and the upfield chemical shift of the side chain 13CO in CO(C)H spectra (174.72 ppm) in comparison with those of all of the other Asn residues of MutT which are in the range of 177.06-178.15 ppm. The binding of AMPCPP caused the chemical shift of the downfield NH proton of the side chain of Asn-119 to move upfield by 0.05 ppm, while the binding of dGTP caused the chemical shift of the downfield NH proton to move downfield, and by the greater amount of 0.54 ppm, suggesting that the side chain NH2 of Asn-119 is involved in substrate recognition by forming a hydrogen bond with O6 of the guanine ring and that it interacts differently with adenine, in which the O6 is replaced by the 6-NH2 group. Second, the ORF-17 enzyme, which

catalyzes the same reaction as MutT and shows structural homology to MutT, but prefers dATP rather than dGTP as a substrate, has an Ala residue replacing Asn-119 (O'Handley et al., 1996). Preferred substrates of the MutT enzyme have bulky substituents at C8 of the purine ring such as 8-bromo-dNTP (Bhatnagar et al., 1991; Frick et al., 1995). The best substrate is the mutagenic nucleotide, 8-oxo-dGTP with a 2000-fold lower KM than that of dGTP (Maki & Sekiguchi, 1994). Only hydrophobic residues such as Leu-4 and Ile-8 approach C8 of bound AMPCPP, suggesting that van der Waals interactions with the substituent at C8 may be responsible for the lower KM of 8-oxo-dGTP. This optimum substrate of MutT is also protonated at N7. However, only hydrophobic residues (Ile-6 and Leu-82) are near N7 of bound AMPCPP, providing no additional explanation of the low KM of 8-oxo-dGTP. The hydrophobic face of the ribose ring of AMPCPP interacts with the side chains of Leu-4 and Ile-6 of -strand A and with the -CH2 of Lys-39 on loop I. The hydrophilic face of the sugar, bearing the two hydroxyl groups, is oriented toward the solvent. Triphosphate Subsite and the Mechanism of the MutT Reaction. Kinetic studies with the substitution-inert Co3+(NH3)4ATP complex have previously shown that the MutT enzyme uses as substrate the ,-bidentate metalATP complex with the  configuration at P (Frick et al., 1994). Although the precise conformation of the Mg2+triphosphate moiety of bound Mg2+AMPCPP is the least well defined structurally due to fewer distance restraints (Figure 6), its amino acid environment is not very sensitive to this variation. The side chain ammonium group of Lys-39 approaches an oxygen of the R-phosphoryl group at a distance of 4.7 ( 1.1 Å averaged over the 16 structures. It

is somewhat farther from an oxygen of the -phosphoryl group (6.0 ( 0.7Å) and farthest from an oxygen of the -phosphoryl group (8.9 ( 0.7Å) (Figure 7). These results suggest that Lys-39 activates the leaving NMP group by electrostatic interaction. Mutation of Lys-39 to Gln results in an 8-fold decrease in kcat and a 5.3-fold increase in KM (dGTP) in the Mg2+-activated dGTPase reaction (Frick et al., 1995). The triphosphate extends across loop I near the conserved residues Gly-38 and Glu-98, approaches the cluster of conserved Glu residues from helix I, and forms a second sphere complex of the enzyme-bound divalent cation (Figures 5 and 7). The position of the enzyme-bound divalent cation is fixed by the ligands, Glu-56, -57, and -98, and the carbonyl group of Gly-38 (Figure 8). A residue larger than the conserved Gly at position 38 would disrupt the coordination sphere of the enzyme-bound metal by colliding with the carboxylate of Glu-98. The octahedral coordination of the enzyme-bound metal is completed by two water ligands, one of which closely approaches the reaction center -phosphorus with a P -OH2 distance of 4.2 ( 0.2 Å averaged over the 16 structures. This short reaction coordinate distance is consistent with an associative nucleophilic substitution at P by water since it is significantly less than the limiting value of 4.9 Å which is required to provide enough room for a metaphosphate type intermediate in a dissociative mechanism (Mildvan, 1981). As with phosphodiesters (Weber et al., 1992b), an associative mechanism of substitution at P of an NTP is much more likely than a dissociative one (Mildvan & Fry, 1987). The oxygen of this water ligand on MutT may be close enough to the two carboxylate oxygens of Glu-53 (2.6 ( 0.2 and 3.6 ( 0.4Å) to donate a hydrogen bond to at least one of them, suggesting either general base catalysis or orientation of the attacking water (or hydroxyl) ligand by Glu-53. The angle of attack, defined by the water oxygen, the attacked P , and the "leaving" methylene carbon, averaged over the 16 structures, is 126 ( 11°, differing from the ideal value of 180° which is expected for a single displacement at phosphorus with inversion. While the stereochemistry of the MutT reaction has not been determined, staphylococcal nuclease, which has a very similar reaction coordinate distance of 4.3 Å between a Ca2+-bound water ligand and the substrate phosphorus, and a similar angle of attack of

Lin et al. Quantitatively, the MutT enzyme with a kcat value of 4.0 s-1 (Frick et al., 1994) accelerates the rate of nucleophilic substitution at the electron-rich -phosphorus of NTP substrates by a factor of 109 in comparison with the rates of model reactions extrapolated to the same temperature and pH (Van Wazer et al., 1955). A major contribution of at least 105-fold to the catalytic power of MutT is provided by the enzyme-bound divalent cation which presents the attacking water or hydroxyl nucleophile to P , thus promoting catalysis by approximation. The factor of g105 is suggested by the observation that mutation of the liganding residue Glu57 to Gln weakened metal binding by 3.5-fold but decreased catalytic activity by at least 105-fold due in part to an altered position of the enzyme-bound divalent cation (Lin et al., 1996). Assuming additivity of effects (Mildvan et al., 1992), another factor of 10 in catalytic power may be provided by Lys-39 as suggested by the effect of the K39Q mutation on kcat (Frick et al., 1995). The nucleotide-bound divalent cation contributes at least 1 order of magnitude by charge neutralization at P as suggested by the 20-fold decrease in activity on replacing Mg2+ at this position with Co3+ (Frick et al., 1994). The remaining factor of e102 may be provided by Glu-53 which either deprotonates or orients the attacking water and which in turn may be oriented by Arg-52, in accord with the g102-fold loss of activity of the R52Q mutant (Frick et al., 1995).3 Although this point has not yet been tested directly by mutagenesis of Glu-53, general base catalysis has been shown in other enzymes to contribute factors ranging from 102 to 106 to catalysis (Mildvan et al., 1992, and references therein). Clearly, additional single and multiple mutations will be necessary to further test these contributions and their additivities. It is of interest to note that all enzymes that catalyze nucleophilic substitution at the electron-rich -phosphorus of NTP substrates appear to require two divalent cations (Frick et al., 1994) and show comparably low catalytic powers, with kcat values ranging from 0.3 to 10 s-1 (Kaziro, 1959; Talarico et al., 1992). While MutT represents the first structure of an enzyme of this class, another such enzyme, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase, is also known to form a second sphere complex between the enzyme-bound divalent cation and the metal-nucleotide substrate (Granot et al., 1980a). Hence, mechanisms similar to that of Figure 8 may apply to other pyrophosphotransferases as well. CONCLUSIONS As determined by solution NMR methods, the binding of the essential divalent cation activator Mg2+ and the substrate analog Mg2+AMPCPP to the MutT enzyme to form the quaternary E-Mg2+-AMPCPP-Mg2+ complex does not alter the global fold of the enzyme but produces localized, small conformational changes at or near the metal and substrate binding sites. The adenine-ribose moiety binds in a hydrophobic cleft near three strands of a mixed -sheet, with the 6-NH2 group of the purine ring approaching the NH2 side chain of Asn-119. With a 6-keto group, GTP would interact more favorably with Asn-119, consistent with the substrate preference of MutT for guanine over adenine nucleotides. The enzyme-bound metal is coordinated by three conserved Glu residues (56, 57, and 98), by the backbone carbonyl of a conserved Gly residue (38), and by two water ligands. The metal-triphosphate moiety of the metal-AMPCPP complex appears to bind in the second

FIGURE 8: Mechanism of the MutT reaction consistent with the structure of the quaternary E-M2+-NTP-M2+ complex and with kinetic data (Frick et al., 1994, 1995) showing possible roles for Lys-39 and Glu-53. Alternatively, Glu-53 may function solely to orient the attacking nucleophile. For clarity, the enzyme-bound divalent cation is depicted as M2+, and the nucleotide-bound divalent cation is depicted as Mg2+.

A search of the 16 structures revealed no nucleophilic residues at the active site of MutT which might attack P as part of a double-displacement mechanism. The four nearest residues to P are Lys-39, Glu-41, Glu-53, and Glu-98 with average P -N or P -O distances of 6.0 ( 0.7, 5.9 ( 0.8, 6.2 ( 0.3, and 4.6 ( 0.9 Å, respectively. The reaction coordinate distances of Lys-39, Glu-41, and Glu-53 are significantly greater than the 4.9 Å limit expected for an associative mechanism. Moreover, a much larger decrease in kcat than 8-fold would be expected in the K39Q mutant if Lys-39 were an essential nucleophile, and Glu-41 is not conserved among MutT like enzymes. While the P -O distance for Glu-98 is appropriate for an associative mechanism, Glu-98 is a ligand to the enzyme-bound divalent cation and therefore cannot function as a nucleophile. All other potential nucleophilic residues are more than 8 Å from P . Hence, a single displacement at P by water, as previously suggested (Weber et al., 1992a), is much more likely than a double displacement. While the positions of the backbone atoms of the solventexposed and highly conserved residue Arg-52 are well determined in the middle of helix I by 19 NOEs involving backbone resonances, the orientation of the side chain is not well defined in the free enzyme (Figure 1) or in the quaternary complex. Systematic variation of the side chain orientation with the program CHAIN reveals that the guanidinium remains at least 8 Å from the triphosphate of bound AMPCPP in the quaternary complex, indicating that Arg-52 cannot interact directly with the substrate. However, the guanidinium can approach a carboxylate oxygen of Glu53 to within hydrogen bonding distance, suggesting that Arg52 may orient Glu-53, which in turn orients the attacking water. Mutation of Arg-52 to Gln results in at least a 102fold loss of MutT activity as estimated by both in Vitro dGTPase assays (Frick et al., 1995) and in ViVo complementation of a mutT deficient strain of Escherichia coli.3 A mechanism of the MutT reaction consistent with the solution structure of the quaternary enzyme-M2+-AMPCPPM2+ complex (Figure 8) thus involves direct nucleophilic attack on the -phosphorus of the M2+-NTP substrate by a water or hydroxyl ligand of the enzyme-bound divalent cation, assisted by the nucleotide-bound divalent cation which neutralizes charge at the -phosphoryl group, by Glu-53 functioning either as a general base or to orient the attacking nucleophile and by Lys-39 which promotes the departure of the leaving group.

Solution Structure of the MutT-M2+-AMPCPP-M2+ Complex coordination sphere of the enzyme-bound divalent cation. One of the water ligands of the enzyme-bound metal ion is well positioned to attack P with inversion and to be deprotonated or oriented by Glu-53. Lys-39 is positioned to interact electrostatically with the R-phosphoryl group and thereby to facilitate the departure of the NMP leaving group. This reaction mechanism, derived from the solution structure of the quaternary MutT complex, is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the results of mutagenesis and kinetic studies and may well be applicable to other enzymes which catalyze nucleophilic substitution at the electron-rich P of NTP substrates.
