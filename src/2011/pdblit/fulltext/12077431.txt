Ê The 1.35 A structure of cadmium-substituted TM-3, a snake-venom metalloproteinase from Taiwan habu: elucidation of a TNFa-converting enzyme-like active-site structure with a distorted octahedral geometry of cadmium
The crystal structure of TM-3, a small snake-venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) isolated from Taiwan habu (Trimeresurus Ê mucrosquamatus), was determined at 1.35 A resolution with resultant R and Rfree values of 0.181 and 0.204, respectively. The overall structure of TM-3 is an oblate ellipsoid that contains three disul®de crosslinks, Cys118±Cys197, Cys159± Cys181 and Cys161±Cys164. It exhibits the typical structural features of SVMPs and is closely related to the structure of the catalytic proteinase domain of TNF-converting enzyme (TACE). In the present structure, the essential catalytic zinc ion was found to be replaced by a cadmium ion during crystallization, as revealed by atomic absorption analysis and X-ray data. This cadmium ion is bound to six ligands, including three conserved histidines and three water molecules, displaying the coordination geometry of a distorted octahedron. One of the water molecules is proposed to play the role of stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate during the catalysis of SVMPs. The putative SH1 speci®city pocket of TM-3 is relatively shallow, in contrast to the deep pockets of adamalysin II, atrolysin C and H2-proteinase, but is similar to those in acutolysin A and TACE. The shallow pocket is a consequence of the presence of the non-conserved disul®de bond Cys159±Cys181 and the residue Gln174 at the bottom of the SH1 pocket. The results indicate that the active-site structure of TM-3, among the know structures of SVMPs examined thus far, is most similar to that of TACE owing to their close disul®de con®gurations and the SH1 speci®city pocket.

1. Introduction
Zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidases (zincins) are widely distributed in various biological systems. They have been classi®ed into three major families, `gluzincins', `metzincins' and `aspzincins', according to the structural topology around the active site (Hori et al., 2001). In metzincins, the typical features of the structure are a -turn with a Met residue (Metturn) near the zinc ion, as well as the metal-binding consensus HExxHxxGxxH sequence at the active site. Based on the overall structures or the source of origin, metzincins are also grouped into four subfamilies, including adamalysins (also termed snake-venom metalloproteinases; SVMPs), matrixins (vertebrate collagenases, also denoted as matrix metalloproteinases; MMPs), serralysins (large bacterial zinc-endopeptidases) and astacins, with the common presence of a È similar zinc-dependent catalytic domain (Stocker et al., 1995; È Stocker & Bode, 1995; Bode et al., 1996). In addition, animal tissues have been reported to produce a large number of

multi-domain proteins, generally called ADAM (a disintegrinlike and metalloproteinase protein), that contain the same central catalytic domain as SVMPs and MMPs (Fox & Long, 1998; Maskos et al., 1998). ADAMs are present in a wide range of organisms and mammalian tissues and appear to be transmembrane proteins which play important roles in many physiological processes, such as fertilization, neurogenesis and in¯ammation (Wolfsberg & White, 1996; Rooke et al., 1996; Tortorella et al., 1999). The similarity of SVMPs, MMPs and ADAMs, along with the high-degree conservation of their tertiary structures at the active sites, suggested that binding of substrates and inhibitors might follow a similar pathway. A well known example is the TNF-converting enzyme (TACE), also called ADAM 17, responsible for the cleavage of membrane-bound TNF precursor at the Ala76±Val77 bond, thus liberating the soluble TNF into the extracellular space (Black et al., 1997; Moss et al., 1997). Recently, the crystal structure of the catalytic proteinase domain of TACE was reported and showed similar topology and organization to the structures of the SVMP family, with almost identical orientations of -helices and the central ®ve-stranded -sheet (Maskos et al., 1998). Since TNF has been implicated in various pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, cachexia and endotoxic shock (Moreland et al., 1997), inhibitors which block the proteolytic activity of TACE may be useful as therapeutic candidates (Barlaam et al., 1999; Xue et al., 2001). The catalytic mechanism of carboxypeptidase A (CPA), one of the most intensively studied examples of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases, is generally believed to proceed through the promoted-water pathway in which the carboxylic group of Glu270 acts as a general base to promote the attack of a nucleophilic water on the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond. The stabilized tetrahedral intermediate then collapses with a requisite proton donation from the protonÈ ated Glu270 (Lipscomb & Strater, 1996). Tyr248 in CPA, once thought to be the proton donor for the leaving amino group of the scissile peptide bond (Dugas, 1989), was recently proposed to form a Tyr OÁ Á ÁHÐN hydrogen bond to the departing amino group (Bukrinsky et al., 1998). However, a site-directed mutagenesis study pointed to the possibility that the phenolic hydroxyl of this Tyr248 is hydrogen bonded to the zinc-bound water molecule, which may cause a further activation of the water molecule (Cho et al., 2001). This proposition is consistent with the kinetic data from serralysins, which suggested that the zinc-coordinated Tyr216 deprotonates a water molecule attacking the zinc-activated substrate (Mock & Yao, 1997). Furthermore, the astacin and an aspzincin GfMEP (a metalloendopeptidase from the mushroom Grifola frondosa) were also reported to possess a Tyr149 and a Tyr133, respectively, holding the zinc ion at the active site (Hori et al., 2001; Yiallouros et al., 2000). These Tyr residues were believed to act as a proton donor to the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate, therefore stabilizing the reaction transition state during catalysis. In SVMPs, this well studied Tyr residue has never been identi®ed in spite of the elucidation of several crystal strucActa Cryst. (2002). D58, 1118±1128

È tures of this proteinase family (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994; Kumasaka et al., 1996; Gong et al., 1998). Instead, this residue in SVMPs appears to be mainly substituted by Pro or Ala residues which possess no lone-pair electrons on their side chains and are oppositely oriented to Tyr149 in astacin. The active site of SVMPs generally shows a zinc ion which was thought to be tetrahedrally coordinated by three His residues and a water molecule. However, the geometry reported for this zinc ion seems somewhat distorted, especially in the cases of adamalysin II and H2-proteinase, in which the three His N42ÐZnÐwater angles are markedly larger than those of È His N42ÐZnÐHis N42 (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1994; Kumasaka et al., 1996). In general, a zinc ion could form complexes with coordination numbers 4, 5 and 6 and the coordination geometry of the zinc ion could be very ¯exible owing to low energy differences between different coordinations (Lipscomb È & Strater, 1996). The structural data of SVMPs lead to a critical question, i.e. whether one or more of the structural binding water molecules located between the zinc-coordinated water and His residues play(s) some role in stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis, like the Tyr149 in astacin. In this report, we describe the high-resolution crystal structure of TM-3, an SVMP from Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus venom (Huang et al., 1993, 1995), in which the activesite zinc ion was replaced by a cadmium ion during the crystallization process. The coordination geometry of this cadmium ion and its coordinated ligands are discussed and compared with the currently available structures of other SVMPs. Moreover, we have made a detailed comparison of the active-site structure of TM-3 with those of other SVMPs as well as TACE, human neutrophil collagenase (HNC) and astacin, with particular reference to the SH1 speci®city pocket. Our results indicate that the active-site structure of TM-3 is most similar to that of TACE among the SVMP structures known thus far.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization

TM-3 was isolated from the venom of Taiwan habu (Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus) and puri®ed to high homogeneity as described previously (Huang et al., 1993). Crystals were obtained using crystallization screening kits fromHampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA, USA). The puri®ed TM-3 (10.5 mg mlÀ1 in 0.2 M ammonium acetate buffer pH 6.0) was mixed with an equal volume of mother liquor [0.1 M CdCl2, 0.1 M sodium acetate and 30%(v/v) PEG 400 pH 4.6] and then crystallized at 277 K using the hanging-drop vapourdiffusion method. Rod-like crystals started to appear and their dimensions reached 0.4 Â 0.4 Â 3.5 mm within two weeks. Replacement of CdCl2 with either ZnCl2 or ZnSO4 at the same concentration (0.1 M) in the mother liquor for alternative crystallization experiments was also accomplished in order to obtain crystals without bound cadmium ions.

2.2. Data collection, processing and structure refinement
Table 1

Ê The 40±1.75 A data set from crystal 1 was collected using a Rigaku R-AXIS IV system at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK, respectively (OtwiÊ nowski & Minor, 1997) (see Table 1). The 99±1.35 A data set from crystal 2 was obtained using beamline 38B1 at SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan. Data were processed and integrated with the program HKL2000 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). All data collections took place at 123 K. The crystal structure of TM-3 was solved by the molecular-replacement method using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and a metalloproteinase model, H2-proteinase (atomic coordinates kindly provided by Dr T. Kumasaka). Manual rebuilding and computational re®nement were performed using the programs O (Jones et al., È 1991) and CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) running on an SGI Octane or O2 workstations. The parameters for ideal protein geometry of Engh and Huber were used for the re®nements (Engh & Huber, 1991) and the stereochemical quality of the re®ned structures was checked with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). In addition, well ordered water molecules were located and included in the model. Both R and Rfree were used to monitor the progress of structural re®nement.

The detection of zinc or cadmium ions of TM-3 under different conditions was accomplished by employing an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi model Z-8200, Tokyo, Japan) and using A-type graphite cuvettes (Hitachi). For the crystalline state condition, crystals of non-bound TM-3 were pipetted out from the mother liquor and washed with 0.25 M Tris±HCl pH 7.5, followed by suspension in 20 ml of the same Tris buffer as a crystal-suspended stock solution. The proteinase concentration was determined by mixing an aliquot of the stock solution with 6.3 M guanidine hydrochloride at pH 7.5 and was spectroscopically analyzed using an extinction coef®cient of 26 390 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 280 nm estimated from the amino-acid sequence of TM-3 (Gill & von Hippel, 1989). When subjected to atomic analysis, aliquots of the crystalsuspended solution were diluted with 0.05 M HNO3 to the concentration range within the standard curve. For the native condition, TM-3 dissolved in 0.025 M ammonium acetate pH 6.0 was directly diluted to appropriate concentrations with 0.05 M HNO3. A series of 1.5±7.5 mM ZnSO4 and 2.8±14.2 nM CdCl2 were used as the standard solutions. The wavelengths for zinc and cadmium absorption were set to 307.6 and 228.8 nm, respectively.
2.4. Activity assay of TM-3 in the crystalline state

using FITC casein as the substrate and puri®ed TM-3 (1.4 mg mlÀ1) as a positive control. The catalytic assays were carried out twice at 310 K with the addition of different amounts of TM-3 crystals.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystallographically deduced sequence and overall structure of TM-3

In order to investigate the proteolytic activity of TM-3 in the crystalline state, the crystal-suspended solution mentioned above was again prepared and the crystals were thoroughly washed with Tris buffer. The activity assay was essentially identical to that of the previous report (Huang et al., 1999)

We collected two sets of diffraction data, 40±1.75 and 99± Ê 1.35 A, from the tetragonal TM-3 crystals using an image plate and a charge-coupled device (CCD) as detectors, respectively. The crystal structure of TM-3 was solved and preliminarily Ê re®ned to 1.75 A resolution using data from the ®rst set, followed by thorough re®nement using the second set to Ê 1.35 A resolution. The ®nal R and Rfree values were 0.181 and 0.204, respectively (Table 1). The primary structure of TM-3 shown in Fig. 1, based on protein sequencing by Edman degradation and cDNA sequence analysis (Huang et al., 1995), was also con®rmed by high-resolution crystallography. We have also listed the segments of protein sequence corresponding to the various secondary-structural elements displayed in Fig. 2. Sequence alignment of TM-3 with some other SVMPs reveals that TM-3 is about 47.0, 49.0, 54.0 and 68.3% identical to acutolysin A, atrolysin C, adamalysin II and H2-proteinase, respectively. 61 of the 200±203 residues are highly conserved among these ®ve sequences, which include those corresponding to the zincbinding consensus segment (residues 143±153) and the MetActa Cryst.

The overall structure of TM-3, as depicted in Fig. 2, exhibits the typical structural features of SVMPs; namely, an oblate ellipsoidal molecule composed of a central ®ve-stranded -sheet mixed with ®ve -helices in a unique arrangement IA-B-II-C-III-IV-V-D-E and a highly conserved methionine-containing turn (Met-turn), i.e. the segment Cys164Ile165-Met166, lying between D and E. The protein structure consists of two domains separated by a cleft. The upper domain (about 150 N-terminal Figure 2 residues) has an open-sandwich topology A ribbon diagram of the overall structure of TM-3.

We noted that the amino-acid Strand IV of the central -sheets, antiparallel to the other sequence of TM-3 identi®ed by X-ray crystal structure (Fig. 1) strands, faces the active-site cleft where the zinc-binding site is appears to show three residue differences, i.e. Tyr20, Ile41 and located. The environment of this metal-binding site is topoAla168, compared with that derived from the open-reading logically very similar to those of other reported metzincins frame of the cDNA clone reported previously (Huang et al., (Figs. 3a and 3b), all of which include a zinc-binding consensus 1995). This variation could be a consequence of the polyActa Cryst. (2002). D58, 1118±1128 Huang et al.

segment, H143E144xxH147xxG150xxH153, located near the end of the D helix. In contrast to other SVMPs with two disul®de cross-linkages, such as adamalysin II and atrolysin C isolated from the venoms of American diamondback rattlesnakes È (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994), the TM-3 structure reported here possesses three disul®de linkages, Cys118±Cys197, Cys159±Cys181 and Cys161±Cys164, with the latter apparently being used for stabilizing the loose Met-turn conformation. The extra disul®de Cys159±Cys181 was also identi®ed in the structure of H2-proteinase and acutolysin A, two small SVMPs isolated from the venoms of Japanese habu (T. ¯avoviridis) and Chinese mainland Agkistrodon acutus, respectively (Kumasaka et al., 1996; Gong et al., 1998).
3.2. The geometry of the environment surrounding the active-site metal ion

The zinc-binding environment, located at the bottom of the relatively ¯at active-site cleft, appears to contain a heavy atom (Cd2+) ligated by the three imidazole N42 atoms of the histidine residues His143, His147 and His153 (Fig. 4). Additionally, in contrast to the single Zn-coordinated water molecule identi®ed in the active site of most zinc-dependent metalloproteinases, e.g. Wat300 in astacin, adamalysin II and acutolysin A (Fig. 4b), three water molecules, Wat359, Wat416 and Wat418, were found to coordinate to the Cd2+. Wat359, bridging the Cd2+ and the neighbouring Glu144, is tightly Ê bound as judged by its low temperature factor (13.3 A2 Ê compared with the global average of 28.6 A2). Presumably, Wat359 is equivalent to the reported Wat300 which is believed to be the nucleophilic water molecule proposed in the catalysis mechanism of carboxypeptidase A. The contact distances Glu144 O41±Wat359 O and Glu144 O42±Wat359 O are shorter Ê Ê (2.94 A and 3.08 A, respectively) than those of other SVMPs È (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994; Kumasaka et al., 1996; Gong et al., 1998). During the structural re®nements, the active-site Cd2+ of Ê TM-3 possesses a temperature factor of 9.2 A2, comparable to those of its coordinated imidazole N atoms, which are 6.8, 7.8 Ê and 8.6 A2, respectively. However, it seems too low if Zn2+ Ê (4.3 A2) is used as the active-site metal ion. Furthermore, the distances between the zinc ion and the N42 atom of its ligated histidines in other structures of SVMP are usually shorter than Ê Ê 2.10 A (2.07 A on average). In the crystal structure of TM-3, the corresponding distances between the metal ion and its Ê Ê ligated histidines are longer than 2.24 A (2.26 A on average), which lies within the normal range of distance between a cadmium ion and its coordinated N atoms. In addition, the presence of Cd2+ in the crystal structure was also con®rmed by atomic absorption analysis. As indicated in Table 3, one molecule of native TM-3 contains approximately one Zn atom, but no Zn atom was detected in the crystal of this report. This spectrophotometric and crystallographic evidence corroborated the fact that the active-site zinc ion of TM-3 had been replaced by a cadmium ion during crystallization. The slightly higher B value for this cadmium compared with those of its surrounding ligand atoms may be a

consequence of the fact that in our crystals there is still a limited content of Zn2+ occupying this site. The coordination geometry of this cadmium ion displays a distorted octahedron, with His143 N42, His153 N42, Wat359 and Wat416 forming an octahedral base plane, and His147 N42 and Wat418 being located at the vertices (see Table 2 and Fig. 4). Notice that the positions of the three histidine ligands show no signi®cant changes compared with those of reported structures of SVMP in which the zinc ion was claimed to display a distorted tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 3b). The proteolytic activity of Cd-bound TM-3 in the crystalline state towards the casein substrate still persisted despite a lower activity (about 5±10%) compared with the native TM-3 in solution (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4(b), our highÊ resolution (1.35 A) structure of TM-3 is likely to lead to the identi®cation of more water molecules in the active site Ê compared with the structures of adamalysin II (2.0 A resoluÊ resolution). Of these water tion) and acutolysin A (1.9 A molecules, we are particularly interested in the role of the two additional Cd-bound waters, Wat416 and Wat418. Whether the presence of these two water molecules arises from the larger van der Waals dimension of the cadmium ion which keeps the mobilities of its ligands low or from the high-resolution diffraction of our crystals remains to be answered. Reminiscently, there were two Zn-coordinated water molecules detected in the active site of a monoclinic aspzincin Ê structure which was re®ned to 1.6 A resolution (Hori et al., 2001). Wat418 of TM-3 occupies a position approximately corresponding to that of the hydroxyl group of Tyr149 in astacin (Fig. 4b). In general, the Zn-coordinated Tyr residue in the structures of astacin and the aspzincin GfMEP have been believed to act as a proton donor to the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intemediate in the catalytic processes (Hori et al., 2001; Yiallouros et al., 2000). However, so far no such Tyr residue has been identi®ed in the active site of SVMP structures. According to a report by Lipscomb (1974), the pKa value of Zn-bound water in carboxypeptidase is approximately 8.9, lower than that of the commonly observed Tyr side chain (pKa = 10.13). Thus, water molecules could functionally display the role of Tyr residue in the formation of a hydrogen bond. We think that the reaction transition state during catalysis of SVMPs is possibly stabilized by a second Zn-bound water molecule which is located between the ®rst catalytic water molecule and one of the three Zn-coordinated histidines, similar to the hydroxyl group of Tyr149 in astacin.

SH1 speci®city subsite (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this segment appears to be more diverse and variable between TM-3 and the other four reported structures of SVMP, except for the conserved Met-turn (Figs. 1 and 3), even though they share a similar overall structure. For acutolysin A, which is fully superimposable in its disul®de con®gurations with TM-3, the relative size and dimension of the SH1 pocket is very similar, except that a slight extension in the latter structure is found (Figs. 5a and 6). In adamalysin II and atrolysin C, only one disul®de bridge, Cys157±Cys164, was identi®ed in the region È corresponding to Gly150±Ser179 of TM-3 (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994). In contrast to TM-3, residues 172± 176 in both the adamalysin II and atrolysin C structures appear to move away from E (see Figs. 3a and 5b). These conformational changes make the SH1 pocket of these two proteinases signi®cantly deeper than that of TM-3 (Fig. 6). However, as shown in Fig. 6, H2-proteinase appears to have a more extended SH1 pocket compared with that of TM-3, although all disul®de linkages are topologically identical to those of our structure. This is attributed to the substitution of Gln174 in TM-3 by Pro173 in H2-proteinase, removing the relatively bulky side chain of Gln (Fig. 5a). Also, Gln174 of TM-3 is shown to correspond to Thr174 in acutolysin A; both possess a similar orientation of their side chains (Fig. 5a). Adamalysin II and H2-proteinase are both non-haemorrhagic and atrolysin C has a weak haemorrhagic activity (Takeya & Iwanaga, 1998). In contrast, acutolysin A has a strong haemorrhagic activity. Based on structural and functional comparisons, the haemorrhagic activity of a particular SVMP seems to be related to the dimension/depth of its SH1 speci®city pocket. However, according to a phylogenetic study (Tsai et al., 2000), TM-3 should be weakly haemorrhagic or non-heamorrhagic and is likely to depart from the presumed correlation between haemorrhagic activity and the SH1 pocket. In addition, based on sequence alignments, a number of SVMPs with strong haemorrhagic activity have a Pro residue equivalent to Pro173 in H2-proteinase (Takeya & Iwanaga, 1998; Tsai et al., 2000). Thus, the SH1 pockets of these SVMPs should be as deep as that of the non-haemorrhagic H2proteinase. This is also contradictory to our proposed

haemorrhagicity±SH1 rule. Hence, in order to delineate the structure±function relationship, an accumulation of solved structures of various SVMPs is warranted. Alternatively, TM-3 was shown to have a low hydrolytic activity (kcat/Km = 1.70 Â 10À4 mMÀ1 sÀ1) toward the casein substrate compared with its variant forms TM-1 and TM-2 (kcat/Km are 7.03 Â 10À4 and 7.32 Â 10À4 mMÀ1 sÀ1, respectively) isolated from the same venom (unpublished data from our group). This raises an interesting question. Is the proteolytic activity of a SVMP related to the dimension and shape of its SH1 pocket? This question can only be answered by many comparative studies of the structure±activity relationships of SVMPs, including TM-1 and TM-2.
3.4. Structural comparison of TM-3 with TACE, human neutrophil collagenase and astacin

Previously, adamalysin II was considered to be a good starting model in the SVMP family for the rational design of drugs against TACE-associated pathological disorders and, indeed, several inhibitors have been synthesized to bind at the active site of TACE based on the crystal structure of adamaÈ lysin II (Cirilli et al., 1997; Gomis-Ruth et al., 1998; D'Alessio et al., 1999). However, the crystal structure of the catalytic proteinase domain of TACE showed that TACE possesses three disul®de bridges (Maskos et al., 1998). Topologically, the Cys423±Cys453 bond of TACE is equivalent to the Cys159± Cys181, Cys158±Cys180 and Cys157±Cys181 bonds in TM-3, H2-proteinase and acutolysin A, respectively, but no equivalent disul®de bond was found in adamalysin II or atrolysin C. Not unexpectedly, the SH1 pocket of the TACE structure, while similar to those of TM-3 and acutolysin A, is signi®cantly more shallow than those of adamalysin II and atrolysin C owing to the additional Cys423±Cys453 bond (Fig. 6). Moreover, Val440 of TACE is shown to be structurally equivalent to Gln174 in TM-3, in terms of forming a similar barrier at the bottom of the SH1 pocket (Fig. 5c). Thus, TM-3 and acutolysin A are perhaps better models for the design of drugs against TACEassociated disorders than adamalysin II. Also shown in Fig. 6, the SH1 pocket conformations of astacin and human neutrophil collagenase (HNC, also termed MMP8) appear to be quite different from that of TM-3. This is caused by the relatively different topology and organization between TM-3, astacin and HNC structures in the segment Gly150±Ser179 of TM-3 and its corresponding regions (Stams et al., 1994; Bode et al., 1992). Furthermore, TM-3 exhibits a similar overall active-site structure to TACE and HNC (Fig. 7),

3.5. The other possible cadmium ions

In addition to the active-site cadmium ion, there are nine other heavy atoms identi®ed in the crystal structure of TM-3 (Table 1 and Fig. 8), which are presumed to be cadmium ions. Five of these heavy atoms, including the active-site atom, are ligated by more than two non-water ligands, such as His, Asp and Glu. They tend to be embedded in the interior of protein molecule and become quite immobiÊ lized (average temperature factor = 15.1 A2), consistent with the reports of some cadmiumbinding glycoproteins (Meisch & Schmitt, 1986; Nair & Robinson, 1999). In general, the imidazole N atom of histidine, the negative carboxylic group of aspartic and glutamic acid, as well as the amide N and O atoms of asparagine and glutamine, are the primary metal-chelation sites for cadmium-binding proteins. Our Cd-containing proteinase crystal is also con®rmed by atomic absorption analysis, which indicated that TM-3 crystals of this report contain about four or ®ve cadmium ions per proteinase molecule (Table 3). As for the locations of other heavy atoms, they are mostly found on the surface of the molecule, so that these atoms appear to be less restricted and more ¯exible (average Ê temperature factor = 31.8 A2). Some of these atoms are located near the twofold symmetric centres between two proteinase molecules and usually do not possess full occupancy. These cadmium ions may play some role in facilitating the packing of proteinase molecules during crystallization, as replacement of cadmium chloride with zinc chloride or sulfate failed to produce proteinase crystals.

4. Conclusions
We report here the high-resolution crystal structure of TM-3 isolated from the venom of Taiwan habu. The TM-3 structure exhibits the Figure 5 Structural comparisons of TM-3 with some reported SVMPs and TACE in the region of the typical structural features of SVMP and segment Gly150±Ser179.

TACE contain Thr174 and Val440, respectively, which are structurally equivalent to Gln174 of TM-3 in terms of forming the bottom of the SH1 subsite. Consequently, the SH1 speci®city pockets among these three proteinases are similar. This report indicates that our structure has a stronger resemblance among the known structures of SVMP to the crystal structure of catalytic domain of TNF-converting enzyme (TACE), especially in the disul®de con®gurations and the SH1 speci®city pocket. So far, native human TACE had been puri®ed from the membranes of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 (Black et al., 1997). Its truncated recombinant forms were also obtained from the expression of TACE cDNAs Figure 6 cloned from the cDNA libraries of Comparisons of the SH1 pocket of TM-3 with various zinc-dependent metalloproteinases from the human leukocyte, monocyte or epitheSVMP, ADAM, MMP and astacin family. All the pockets are drawn on the same scale. A lial cell (Black et al., 1997; Moss et al., tryptophan, denoted as a stick model, was modelled into each pocket as a dimension reference. The Ê pocket diameters of TM-3 are indicated in A. The ®gure was produced using GRASP. TACE, the 1997). However, their isolation and catalytic domain of TNF-converting enzyme; HNC, the catalytic domain of human neutrophil puri®cation procedures were usually collagenase (Stams et al., 1994). complicated and the active TACE was only obtained in small amounts. In contrast, SVMPs are abundant in the venoms of crotalid and viperid snakes. Thus, this leads to the possibility of creating an alternative assay system using SVMPs, which can be easily isolated and used for analysis of the TACE inhibitors. Furthermore, many naturally occurring SVMP inhibitors, e.g. endogenous peptidic inhibitors in the venom secretions (Robeva et al., 1991; Francis & Kaiser, 1993; Huang et al., 1998), and several proteinaceous inhibitors in the sera of the snake itself or some mammals (Catanese & Kress, 1992; Yamakawa & Omori-Satoh, 1992; Figure 7 Huang et al., 1999) were shown to Solid-surface representation of the structures of TM-3 and the catalytic domains of TNFspeci®cially and effectively inhibit the converting enzyme (TACE) and human neutrophil collagenase (HNC).

The TACE-catalyzed product tumour region is found to form and dictate the conformation of the necrosis factor- (TNF) has been reported to play a benesubstrate-binding pocket, particularly of the SH1 subsite. The ®cial role as an immunostimulant and an important mediator putative SH1 speci®city pocket of TM-3 is relatively shallower of host resistance to many infectious agents and, probably, than those of H2-proteinase, adamalysin II and atrolysin C malignant tumours (Vilcek & Lee, 1991). Whether some of the because of the presence of the disul®de bond Cys159±Cys181 SVMPs or their modi®ed derivatives can functionally substiin the TM-3 structure and the substitution of Gln174 of TM-3 tute the role of TACE in patients with TACE-de®ciency by Pro173 in H2-proteinase. It is noted that acutolysin A and diseases deserves to be investigated in the future.
