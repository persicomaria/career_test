To determine the in vivo role of miR-430 repression of lft, we focused on lft2 because the repression of lft2 by miR-430 was more pronounced than it was for lft1 (Fig. 1A and fig. S2). lft2 target protection resulted in elevated lft2 expression, similar to the finding in MZdicer mutants (Fig. 3B). lft2-TPmiR-430­injected embryos displayed cyclopia, reduced gsc expression (Figs. 3D and 4B and fig. S6) (6, 8, 12), and fewer sox17-expressing endodermal and forerunner cells (Fig. 4, C to E). These results indicate that miR-430 can enhance Nodal signaling by dampening lft2. To determine the role of miR-430 in simultaneously dampening both sqt and lft2, we coinjected sqt-TPmiR-430 and lft2-TPmiR-430. The induction of gsc was not strongly affected in sqt/lft2-TPmiR-430 embryos and MZdicer mutants (Fig. 4B), but the expression of sox17 revealed a reduced number of endodermal and dorsal forerunner cells in sqt/lft2-TPmiR-430 embryos and MZdicer mutants (Fig. 4, C to E). These results indicate that loss of miR-430 regulation leads to an imbalance of sqt and lft inputs and reduces some outputs of Nodal signaling. Our study of miR-430 and Nodal signaling provides two major insights. First, the regulation of sqt and lft2 by miR-430 identifies a role for miRNAs as dampeners and balancers of agonist/ antagonist pairs and reveals a previously unknown regulatory layer of Nodal signaling (Fig. 4, A and F, and fig. S1). miR-430 reduces the absolute levels of sqt and lft2 expression (dampening) and regulates their relative levels to achieve optimal activity of the Nodal pathway (balancing). The protection of sqt and lft2 from miR-430 does not appear to lead to major phenotypic changes during blastula stages (gsc expression) but reduces Nodal signaling during gastrulation (sox17 expression). Because Nodal and Lefty signals have complex regulatory interactions (6, 7), multiple mechanisms might contribute to this temporal difference. For example, stronger derepression (Figs. 1A and 3, A and B) and longer persistence of lft2 after loss of miR-430 regulation could inhibit Sqt and the related Nodal signal Cyclops during gastrulation (6, 8, 12). The regulation of Nodal signaling by miR-430 is likely to be conserved, because miR-430 is found in other vertebrates (miR-302, miR-372, and miR-519) and predicted miR-430 target sites are present in other Nodal and Lefty genes (fig. S1) (4). More generally, our results reveal a regulatory interaction in which a repressor (miR-430) dampens the expression of both an agonist (sqt) and an antagonist (lft) (Fig. 4, A and F, and fig. S1). Dampening might not only allow balancing of counteracting inputs but also add robustness (14­18). For example, our overexpression experiments show that the embryo can tolerate increased expression of miR-430­regulated sqt or lft mRNA, whereas loss of miR-430­ mediated regulation leads to gain-of-function phenotypes (Fig. 1C and fig. S2). miRNA-mediated balancing of agonist/antagonist pairs might also contribute to the evolution of phenotypic changes. The short region of sequence complementarity required for the recognition of miRNA target sites allows for the rapid acquisition, loss, or modulation of miRNA-mRNA target interactions (19­21). Our results raise the possibility that target sequence variations could change the balance of agonist/antagonist expression and induce phenotypic changes such as the expansion or reduction of progenitor fields. Second, our study introduces a method to test the role of specific miRNA-mRNA pairs in vivo (fig. S8). Thousands of miRNA-mRNA interactions have been predicted, but less than a dozen have been shown to have an in vivo function (2, 3). The sequence-selectivity of morpholino target protectors makes them excellent agents to disrupt specific miRNA-mRNA interactions. Other antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules that bind to miRNA target sites or their vicinities are also likely to serve as target protectors. Target protectors not only uncover the physiological role of miRNA-mRNA interactions, but also illustrate how miRNA phenotypes are a composite created by up-regulation of multiple targets (fig. S8). Additionally, target protectors might serve as therapeutic agents (fig. S8). More than 30% of all human genes are thought to be miRNA targets (1­3). By blocking the interaction of specific miRNA-mRNA pairs through the use of target protectors, the translation and stability of particular mRNAs could be increased and result in the suppression of hypomorphic mutations or the upregulation of beneficial gene products such as tumor suppressors or peptide hormones (fig. S8).

PKA Type IIa Holoenzyme Reveals a Combinatorial Strategy for Isoform Diversity
Jian Wu,1 Simon H. J. Brown,1 Sventja von Daake,1 Susan S. Taylor1,2* The catalytic (C) subunit of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)­dependent protein kinase (PKA) is inhibited by two classes of regulatory subunits, RI and RII. The RII subunits are substrates as well as inhibitors and do not require adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form holoenzyme, which distinguishes them from RI subunits. To understand the molecular basis for isoform diversity, we solved the crystal structure of an RIIa holoenzyme and compared it to the RIa holoenzyme. Unphosphorylated RIIa(90400), a deletion mutant, undergoes major conformational changes as both of the cAMP-binding domains wrap around the C subunit's large lobe. The hallmark of this conformational reorganization is the helix switch in domain A. The C subunit is in an open conformation, and its carboxyl-terminal tail is disordered. This structure demonstrates the conserved and isoform-specific features of RI and RII and the importance of ATP, and also provides a new paradigm for designing isoform-specific activators or antagonists for PKA.

tion that includes a dimerization/docking (D/D) domain at the N terminus and two tandem Cterminal cAMP-binding (CNB) domains (domains A and B). The linker joining the D/D and CNB domains is highly disordered in dissociated dimers (3) and contains an inhibitor site that resembles a peptide substrate and docks to the active site of the catalytic (C) subunit in the holoenzyme, thereby blocking its activity. The two major classes of R subunit (I and II) each have a and b isoforms. The isoforms are functionally nonredundant, and isoform diversity is a primary mechanism for achieving specificity in PKA signaling (4). The inhibitor site is a distinguishing feature of the isoforms. RII subunits have a phosphorylation site in their inhibitor motif and thus are both substrates and inhibitors, whereas RI subunits with Ala or Gly at the P-site are pseudo-substrates. RI subunits require ATP and two Mg2+ ions to form a stable holoenzyme complex (binding affinity Kd = 0.1 nM) (5), whereas RII subunits do not (Kd = 0.1 nM). Although the structures of the open and closed conformations of the C subunit (6, 7) and the cAMP-bound structures of RIa and RIIb (8, 9) have been solved, they do not explain how C is inhibited by R, how the holoenzyme is activated by cAMP, and how the isoforms differ. To understand the molecular basis for differential regulation of type I and type II holoenzymes, we purified a deletion mutant of RIIa, RIIa(90-400), and cocrystallized it with the Ca subunit in the absence of ATP, then compared it to the RIa holoenzyme (10, 11). In contrast to the C subunit's fully closed conformation in the type I holoenzyme, in the RIIa complex the C subunit is in an open conformation, the ATP binding pocket is empty, the aB/aC helix is distorted, and the C-terminal tail is disordered. Like RIa, RIIa undergoes major conformational changes as it wraps around the large lobe of the C subunit. The hallmarks of this conformational switch are changes associated with the helical subdomains of both cAMP-binding domains. Most striking is the helix switch in domain A, which snaps apart the two CNB domains. In the holoenzyme, domain B of RIIa docks onto the aH-aI loop of the C subunit. This structure demonstrates the combinatorial diversity of the C subunit as it uses diverse sets of docking motifs to interact in unique ways with different inhibitors, and we presume that this diversity is also related to recognition of different protein substrates. The structure also demonstrates how ATP differentially regulates these two holoenzymes. ATP is essential for forming the type I holoenzyme, much as guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is essential for generating the active

conformation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins), whereas in type II holoenzymes, ATP, through autophosphorylation, actually promotes dissociation. A monomeric deletion mutant of RIIa was cocrystallized with the wild-type Ca subunit in the absence of Mg2ATP (for statistics, see table

S1). The structure reveals a large interface that engages the entire RIIa subunit but only the large lobe of the C subunit (Fig. 1). The C subunit, with the exception of a distorted aB-aC loop, assumes an open conformation. The active-site cleft is open and the C-terminal tail (residues 319 to 331) is disordered (Figs. 2 and 3).

site and linker region, which are disordered in the free RII subunit, become ordered in the holoenzyme. Docking of domain A onto the large lobe of the C subunit creates an extended interface, whereas domain B contributes a small but essential docking motif that binds to the aH-aI loop on the C subunit (Fig. 1, B and C). The large lobe of the C subunit functions as a stable scaffold for RIIa, with the binding interface extending from the common inhibitor binding site at the active-site cleft, over the activation loop and the P+1 loop, to the aH-aI loop (Fig. 1 and fig. S1). ATP is not required for this highaffinity binding (~1.0 nM). The C subunit is in an open conformation similar to that of the apoenzyme (6) (Fig. 2 and fig. S2). The small lobe is more dynamic than the large lobe, as indicated by the disorder of many side chains and the discontinuity of the C-terminal tail. Comparison of average temperature factors (B factors) for the RIIa and RIa holoenzymes reveals a striking isoform difference in dynamics (Fig. 3C). In both holoenzymes there is 70% water content, and crystal packing does not influence the small lobe. In contrast to the C subunit, RIIa undergoes major conformational changes in almost its entire molecular architecture relative to the unbound structure. Each domain contains a and b subdomains. The b sandwich harbors the signature motif of the CNB, the phosphate-binding cassette (PBC), where the phosphate moiety of cAMP docks. The release of cAMP uncouples the a and b subdomains (12), thus allowing for global conformational changes in the helices that are induced and stabilized by binding of the C subunit. RIIa undergoes three major changes: (i) ordering of the inhibitor peptide and the following linker segment; (ii) reorganization of the helical subdomains of domain A, which leads to the separation of domains A and B; and (iii) reorganization of the helical subdomain of domain B to accommodate docking to the aH-aI loop in the C subunit. With this structure we can appreciate the conservation of the dynamic uncoupling of the A and B domains as they release cAMP and bind to the C subunit. For simplicity, we divide the large R-C interface into four distinct sites on the C subunit (Fig. 1). Site 1, where the inhibitor peptide docks to the active-site cleft, most clearly distinguishes the Rsubunit isoforms. Site 2 is dominated by the aG helix and the P+1 loop, site 3 includes the activation loop and the APE-aF loop, and site 4 is the aH-aI loop. The RII-specific features of sites 1 and 4 are described in detail below; sites 2 and 3 are discussed in (13). Because RII subunits are substrates as well as inhibitors, they engage the active-site cleft differently from RIa subunits. RIIa(90-400) begins with Arg92R-Arg-Val-Ser-Val96R, where Ser95R is the unphosphorylated P-site. (For clarity, we adopt a nomenclature where residues from the R and C subunits are respectively designated by superscripts R and C.) The positions of the backbone and side chains in this segment are nearly identical to those of the protein kinase inhibitor peptide PKI(5-24) and RIa, even though both PKI and RIa, with Ala at the P-site, are pseudosubstrates (Fig. 3). The C subunit in the RIIa holoenzyme structure assumes an open conformation, in contrast to the fully closed conformation found in the PKI(5-24)­C complex (7) and the RIa holoenzyme (10, 11). Because the RIIa and C subunits were cocrystallized in the absence of MgATP, there is no phosphate on Ser95R. In the presence of ATP the inhibitor site would undergo autophosphorylation, which reduces the affinity of RIIa for the C subunit (14). A major isoform difference is that each residue from the five-residue peptide is docked firmly onto the large lobe; neither the small lobe nor the C-terminal tail is involved (Fig. 2C and fig. S2). In contrast, recruitment of the small lobe and the C-terminal tail are essential for RIa and PKI, where the g-phosphate of ATP is trapped between the two lobes, as it is in the transition state during catalysis (15). Instead, in the RIIa holoenzyme, the P-site Ser forms hydrogen bonds with catalytic loop residues that are anchored to the P+1 loop (Fig. 2C). The P+1 Val, disordered in the free RII subunit, docks onto the P+1 loop and nucleates the hydrophobic interface between RIIa and C by interacting with Tyr247C in the aG helix of C and Tyr209R in the PBC of RIIa (fig. S1). Although Tyr247C does not change much relative to its position in the free C subunit, Tyr209R is recruited because of the rearrangement of domain A. This hydrophobic docking surface, which is similar to RIa (10, 11), is discussed in (13). In addition to the P-site residue, the linker regions account for considerable variation in overall organization of full-length RI and RII subunits and their corresponding holoenzymes (16­18). In previous cAMP-bound structures of RIa and RIIb, the linker region was always disordered (8, 9). Figure 3 and fig. S3 highlight some of the RII-specific interactions in this region. Glu99R, for example, causes a distortion of the aB-aC loop relative to all previous C-subunit structures (Fig. 2) and is essential for forming type II, but not type I, holoenzymes (19). The importance of other RII-specific sites in the linker is discussed in (13). The aH-aI loop (Fig. 1, B and C) is an important docking site for domain B. This region contains a five-residue insert (residues 282C to 287C) that is unique to the AGC kinases (20). It also contains Arg280C, the last highly conserved residue in the kinase core, which forms ion pairs with Glu208C in the APE motif at the end of the P+1 loop. Recent genetic studies suggest that there is feedback between this region and the peptide recognition site (21). This site is thus likely to be a "hot spot" for allosteric regulation at several levels.

When holoenzyme forms, major changes take place in the CNB domains of RIIa. The global change in architecture that splays apart domains A and B is due to the long contiguous helix that is formed by the merging of the aB and aC helices in domain A (Fig. 4 and fig. S4). Changes in domain B are also substantial but different (figs. S4 and S5). Both hydrophobic capping residues for cAMP lie in domain B and are displaced by this movement. In contrast to the helical subdomains, both b subdomains are stable with the exception of the PBC. Domain A provides the major isoformindependent docking surface for the C subunit and also mediates the global reorganization of the two CNBs. The most striking change is the "aB/aC switch" where the kinked aB and aC helices of the cAMP-bound state snap into a fully extended single helix. This aB/aC switch, a conserved feature of both isoforms (Fig. 4 and fig. S4), not only separates the two CNB domains but also removes the capping residue for site A. The aB/aC motif provides a major interacting surface for docking to the C subunit (Fig. 1D) as well as to the linker region (fig. S3), with many residues previously exposed to solvent now serving to nucleate the RIIa-C interface (13). In addition to being "flipped away" from domain A, domain B also undergoes major conformational changes within its helical subdomain. In domain B of RIIa the hydrophobic capping residue for cAMP is Tyr381R, which is located within its own aC helix, similar to catabolite activator protein (CAP) (22); in the holoenzyme, Tyr381R is no longer close to the PBC because of the conformational changes (Fig. 4). However, the aC helix does not fuse with the aB helix but forms a helixturn-helix (aC´-aC´´) motif (Fig. 4B and fig. S4). In the holoenzyme, Tyr381R is exposed to solvent. Although the cAMP-bound structures of RIa and RIIb enabled the identification of residues essential for cAMP binding (8, 9), the functions of other conserved residues were not explained. Their conserved functions are revealed only by the two holoenzyme structures. Arg376R is an example. The electrostatic contact between Arg376R in the aC helix and Glu265R in the aA helix of domain B is a conserved feature of both holoenzymes, whereas in the cAMP-bound state both residues are exposed to solvent. This electrostatic interaction stabilizes the capping residues in both holoenzyme conformations, even though the location of the A-site capping residue is isoform-specific (Fig. 4B). Arg365R in the aB helix is a conserved part of the R-C interface for both holoenzymes, where it forms essential multivalent interactions with Lys285C in the AGCspecific insert that lies in the aH-aI loop (Fig. 1C). In RII subunits, however, Arg365R is also the capping residue for cAMP bound to site A. Other residues such as Arg213R and Glu204R in the PBC play a conserved role in binding cAMP but are exposed to solvent in the holoenzymes. The roles of many key residues in each conformational state are summarized in table S2. A tyrosine at the tip of the PBC is another highly conserved feature of A domains. In both holoenzyme structures this tyrosine is essential for docking to C (figs. S1 and S4). The environment of this tyrosine, however, is isoformspecific. In RIIa Tyr209R is part of an extended hydrogen-bonding network, where it anchors the PBC of domain A to two essential elements in the helical subdomain of domain B. In RIa, Tyr205R is exposed to solvent (fig. S4). Comparison of the holoenzyme structures shows the wide dynamic range of the CNB domains (23). The A domains in both RI and RII are similar in their cAMP and holoenzyme conforma-

tions. The B domains are also similar. However, the holoenzyme conformations of the A and B domains are different from each other (fig. S5). Thus, there is not a conserved mechanism for snapping open the aB-aC helix into a single fused helix. To appreciate the versatility of the C subunit, one needs to consider it as a scaffold. Figure 4C and fig. S6 summarize the different parts of the C subunit that can be recruited to recognize its inhibitors (RI, RII, and PKI). Each inhibitor must accomplish two things: It must bind with high affinity and also must inhibit catalytic activity. A substrate-like inhibitor sequence is required for inhibition but is not sufficient for high-affinity binding. For both R subunits to achieve highaffinity binding, docking of domain A to the large lobe of the C subunit (sites 2/3) is essential; however, this is not sufficient. In addition to domain A, RI subunits require the N-lobe and C-tail coupled through Mg2ATP to the inhibitor site (24), whereas RII subunits require site 4 coupled to domain B. Like RIa, PKI uses the N-lobe and C-tail plus Mg2ATP, but achieves high affinity by using another site entirely, the aF-aG loop (site 5) (7). RI subunits and PKI both induce a fully closed conformation and require Mg2ATP (5), where the g-phosphate of ATP brings together both lobes (Fig. 4C). Because the inhibitor peptide is a pseudo-substrate and lacks a P-site acceptor, ATP traps the complex in an inactive state, much as GTP traps G proteins in an active state. Formation of RII holoenzyme does not require the N-lobe, the C-tail, or Mg2ATP. Because the P-site is a Ser, RII subunits cannot trap the R-C complex in a stable transition state; instead, the P-site Ser is anchored to the large lobe (Fig. 4C). For RII holoenzymes, ATP facilitates dissociation through autophosphorylation of the P-site rather than stabilizing the inhibited state (14). A corollary for these two models is that RII holoenzymes depend exclusively on cAMP for activation, whereas RI holoenzymes can be regulated by Mg and ATP as well as by cAMP. These two holoenzymes provide a basis for designing novel isoform-specific activators and inhibitors of PKA.

Fig. 4. Rearrangements of CNB domains. (A) Global change in domain B is due to the extension of the aB-aC helix into a single long helix. There is a ~120° flip from the cAMP-bound state (right) compared to its R-C complex state (left). The position of domain B in the cAMP-bound state is shown by a transparency on the left. The aB helices from both CNBs, shown in red, are essential docking motifs. The PBCs are shown in dark green. Also labeled are the capping residues (Arg365R for site A and Tyr381R for site B), a salt bridge pair (Arg376R-Glu265R), and four basic residues that dock to the RIIa linker. In the cAMP-bound state, these basic residues are exposed to solvent. (B) The capping residues (shaded and indicated by arrows) for RIa and RIIa in their holoenzyme conformation are far from their respective cAMP binding sites. A novel salt bridge (Arg366R-Glu261R for RIa, Arg376R-Glu265R for RIIa) is formed only upon holoenzyme formation. (C) The combinatorial diversity for the C subunit is demonstrated by shading the surface of the docking motifs that are used for binding different inhibitors (RI, RII, and PKI). Site 1, where the inhibitor peptide (yellow) docks, is essential for inhibition. Site 1 in each holoenzyme is expanded at the center of the panel. The other sites [N-lobe and C-tail in green, aG helix (site 2) in red, activation loop (site 3) in dark red, aH-aI loop (site 4) in yellow, and the aF-aG loop (site 5) in blue] are used in a combinatorial fashion to achieve high-affinity binding.

Fluorescence-Force Spectroscopy Maps Two-Dimensional Reaction Landscape of the Holliday Junction
Sungchul Hohng,1,2* Ruobo Zhou,1 Michelle K. Nahas,1 Jin Yu,1,4 Klaus Schulten,1,3,4 David M. J. Lilley,5 Taekjip Ha1,2,3,4 Despite the recent advances in single-molecule manipulation techniques, purely mechanical approaches cannot detect subtle conformational changes in the biologically important regime of weak forces. We developed a hybrid scheme combining force and fluorescence that allowed us to examine the effect of subpiconewton forces on the nanometer scale motion of the Holliday junction (HJ) at 100-hertz bandwidth. The HJ is an exquisitely sensitive force sensor whose force response is amplified with an increase in its arm lengths, demonstrating a lever-arm effect at the nanometer-length scale. Mechanical interrogation of the HJ in three different directions helped elucidate the structures of the transient species populated during its conformational changes. This method of mapping two-dimensional reaction landscapes at low forces is readily applicable to other nucleic acid systems and their interactions with proteins and enzymes. any biological processes are dependent on tension. In recent years, singlemolecule force measurements have shown directly that biochemical reactions can be influenced by applied force (1). Yet, purely mechanical tools cannot detect small-scale conformational changes unless strong and persistent force is applied. At weak forces, the flexible tether connecting the mechanical probe to the biological molecule is not stretched enough to transmit small movements. This is unfortunate because weak and transient forces are likely more prevalent in vivo, but the experimental limitations confine single-molecule mechanical studies to examining the effect of relatively large forces. We aimed to study the effect of weak external forces on the biomolecular conformational dynamics by combining single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) (2­4) with manipulation using optical trap (5). smFRET has high spatial resolution [ 5 Å (6, 7)] and can

be measured at arbitrarily low forces. Previous attempts to combine FRET and optical trap using the DNA hairpin as a model system (8, 9) did not reveal new information because the hairpin unzips at high forces (~15 pN), a regime that had been extensively investigated using force-based techniques (10, 11). Here, we report an approach to detect nanometer-scale motion at sub-pN forces. We used the approach to gain insight into the reaction landscape of the Holliday junction (HJ) by gently stretching it along different directions. The HJ is a four-stranded DNA structure that forms as an intermediate during recombination (12). To understand the mechanisms of cellular enzymes that function with the HJ, a detailed description of the static and dynamic structural properties of the HJ itself is needed. In the absence of added ions, the HJ adopts an open structure, where the four helical arms point toward the corners of a square (13, 14) (Fig. 1A). In the presence of physiological concentrations of magnesium ions, the HJ becomes more compact by pairwise coaxial stacking of helical arms into a right-handed antiparallel stacked-X structure (13­15). There are two ways of forming this stacked structure that depend upon the choice of helical stacking partners (isoI and isoII) (Fig. 1B). For these studies, we have chosen a sequence with nearly equal population of stacking conformers isoI and isoII (16) (17) (fig. S1). smFRET studies showed that an HJ continually switches between the two stacking conformations (18). SCIENCE VOL 318

At present, there is no structural information on the transient species populated during these conformational changes. To investigate the nature of such transient HJ structures and to understand how HJ conformational properties could depend on physiologically relevant forces, we built a hybrid instrument that combines smFRET with optical trapping via a long linker (bacteriophage l DNA) (17). The trapping and fluorescence excitation beams in our confocal microscope are spatially separated (minimum 13 mm) (Fig. 1C), such that fluorescence and force processes can operate without mutual interference. The long linker acts as a loose spring that dampens the random forces generated by Brownian motion of the trapped bead and reduces force variations due to the nanometer-scale conformational change of the HJ. The effective stiffness of the l DNA at 2 pN of force is about 0.002 pN/nm, such that a 5-nm movement of the HJ causes negligible force fluctuations (~0.01 pN) at the trapped bead. Therefore, the measurements can be performed under effectively constant force without the need for active force clamping. The relaxation time scales of the l DNA under tension are faster than the time scale of conformational fluctuations we investigated (19). The trapping beam (1064 nm) was fixed along the optical axis of the microscope, and force was applied by moving the surfacetethered HJ using a piezoelectric sample scanner. The confocal excitation beam (532 nm) was programmed to follow the HJ using a piezocontrolled mirror to maintain uniform excitation and detection efficiencies regardless of the specimen location (and therefore force) (17). To determine comprehensively the force response of the HJ, we used the following four constructs (Fig. 1A). The four helices composing the HJ are named B (red), H (green), R (dark gray), and X (gray). Helix R was labeled at its 5 terminus with biotin for surface immobilization, and helices X, H, or B were extended by a 12-nt single-stranded DNA 5 overhang to permit annealing to a cohesive end of l DNA (named junctions XR, HR, and BR, respectively). The other end of the l DNA was attached to a bead via digoxigenin/anti-digoxigenin coupling in order to pull on the DNA using optical tweezers in three different directions, between the X and R arms for junction XR, and so on. Junctions XR and XR-long differ in the length of the X and R arms [11 base pairs (bp) versus 21 bp]. Cy3 (FRET donor) was attached to the end of helix H, and Cy5 (acceptor) to the end of helix B.
