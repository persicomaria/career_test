Abstract This study was undertaken to improve the renal clearance and tumor targeting properties of 99mTc-labeled humanized anti-Tac (HuTac) monoclonal antibody Fab fragments using two chemical approaches: 1) labeling with a renal secretion agent 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) and 2) lowering its isoelectric point (pI) by acylation. HuTac Fab (3.3 mg/mL) was reacted with a trifluorophenyl ester (TFP) of 99m Tc-MAG3 alone or was additionally reacted with TFP-glycolate to reduce the pI. In Balb/c mice, 99mTc-MAG3-Fab (pI 9.3) rapidly accumulated in the kidneys (177% injected dose [ID]/g at 15 min) and then gradually cleared out of the kidneys. In contrast, the glycolation (pI 4.6 6.6) drastically reduced the renal uptake (31% ID/g) and also the whole-body retention (82% ID vs 101% for the nonglycolated) at 15 min, indicating that the glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab (pI 4.6 6.6) was rapidly excreted. The glycolated remained in the blood longer than the nonglycolated (1.2% vs 0.3% ID/g at 360 min), but this effect was less drastic than the effect shown on the renal uptake. In nude mice bearing receptor-positive (ATAC4) tumors, the glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab increased the peak tumor uptake to 14.8% ID/g from 8.3% ID/g for 99mTc-MAG3-Fab, whereas the glycolation resulted in a drastic reduction of the renal uptake at 15 min. We demonstrated that the renal clearance and the tumor targeting of Fab could be optimized by chemical modifications. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Monoclonal antibody Fab fragments radiolabeled with gamma emitters have been extensively evaluated for radioimmunodetection of tumors as an alternative to their intact IgG counterparts. Currently, 99mTc-labeled arcitumomab Fab' (anti-CEA) [32], and 99mTc-nofetumomab Merpentan Fab [8], and the Fab of anti-myosin [6,21,29] have been approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The advantage of the fragments lies in their rapid penetration into the tumor because of their smaller

size (50 kDa) and lower immunogenecity [7,9,15,38]. However, the antibody fragments [4,10,12,16,19,22,45] and other low molecular weight proteins (LMWPs) [31] have shown high renal accumulation that interfered with tumor imaging in the abdomen because of the high background. The high background also caused image artifacts when single photon emission reconstruction was performed. In addition, the dosimetry to the kidney is high when radioimmunotherapy is performed. LMWPs are filtered readily through glomerulus [31,5,18,43] and are subsequently reabsorbed via a charge attraction to the negatively charged phospholipid bilayer of proximal tubular cells [1,4,11,20, 33,34,40] and catabolized in the cells [26,35,36,39,44]. Several pharmacological and chemical approaches have been applied to reduce the renal accumulation of LMWPs. Several investigators have lowered the renal uptake by blocking tubular absorption with the infusion of basic amino acids such as L-lysine and arginine [2,3,20,33]. We have

also demonstrated that the renal uptake of radiolabeled fragments, such as 99mTc-MAG3-dsFv, 125I-labeled dsFv, and 125I-labeled Fab, could be blocked by L-lysine coinjection in a dose- and time-dependent manner [26,27]. Alternatively, we inhibited the tubular absorption by neutralizing the positive charges of the antibody fragments by acylation of amino groups with glycolate molecules [25,28], and with lactate and succinate molecules [24]. Khaw et al. [23] also demonstrated altered biodistribution of 111In-labeled Fab by conjugation with succcinated polylysine. This acylation approach was also useful for reducing renal accumulation of 125I-labeled Fab and for improving tumor uptake in tumor-bearing mice by increasing the blood concentration of 125I-labeled Fab [27,28]. We extended this chemical approach to reduce renal accumulation of 99mTclabeled Fab. We believe that the reduction of renal uptake at the early time intervals after injection would enhance the usefulness of Fab that is labeled with the short-lived radionuclide for scintigraphic detection of tumors. Using 99mTclabeled Fab of humanized anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (HuTac) directed against the subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R , Tac antigen), we evaluated the effect of the lowering of pI on tumor and renal uptake. We also evaluated the additive effect of L-lysine co-injection on further reducing renal uptake of the glycolated, radiolabeled Fab fragments.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Fragmentation of monoclonal antibody Humanized anti-Tac (HuTac) monoclonal antibody was used as a model antibody. It was constructed by combining the complementary-determining region of the murine antiTac [41] with the human IgG1 framework and constant regions. Its production was previously reported [37]. We prepared the Fab fragment from HuTac IgG by papain digestion (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) as previously reported [27]. Briefly, 20 mg of HuTac IgG (5 mg/mL) was incubated with papain-agarose gel (50 L/mg of IgG) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 25 mM cysteine HCl (pH 7.0) for 4 hr at 37°C. The Fab fragments were purified using protein-A Sepharose gel (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) and analyzed using size-exclusion HPLC (TSK 2000, TosoHaas, Philadelphia, PA) eluted with 67 mM PBS containing 100 mM potassium chloride (pH 6.7). The purity of HuTac Fab was 95%, as determined by an elution profile with ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic detection on size-exclusion HPLC. 2.2. Acylation and radiolabeling with

react in 10 mL of acetonitrile using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (12 mmol) as a coupling agent for 4 hr at room temperature. The ester derivative was purified by normal phase HPLC equipped with a Porasil PrepPak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA; hexane:ethyl acetate:acetic acid 750:250:5; 5 mL/min). We labeled HuTac Fab with 125I after its glycolate conjugation, whereas we labeled HuTac Fab with 99m Tc-MAG3 before its glycolate conjugation. Benzoyl MAG3 was synthesized according to the method of Fritzberg et al. [13]. Benzoyl-MAG3 was radiolabeled with 99m Tc, activated to a TFP ester of 99mTc-MAG3 using the method of Visser et al. [42] and Yoo et al. [45], and purified by a Sep-Pak C18 column. The purified 99mTc-MAG3-TFP was allowed to react with HuTac Fab (3.3 mg/mL) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) for 30 min at 4°C. To acylate the Fab, we sequentially added 99mTc-MAG3-TFP and TFP-glycolate in respective order at a TFP-glycolate/ Fab molar ratio of 60. To use as a control for the biodistribution studies, we radioiodinated Fab with 125I by the chloramine-T method [17,27]. The radiolabels were purified by size-exclusion PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) chromatography with PBS. The purity of the radiolabeled antibody fragments was confirmed with instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC; 1:1 methanol: 10% ammonium acetate in water), paper chromatography (saline), and size-exclusion HPLC with a TSK G2000SW column (TosoHaas, Philadelphia, PA; 0.067 M PBS-0.1 M KCl, pH 6.8; 1 mL/min). 2.3. Isoelectric focusing and autoradiography The radiolabeled HuTac Fabs and standard markers with pI values ranging from 3.5 to 9.3 were electrofocused on gels (PhastGel IEF 3­9, Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using PhastSystem (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The protein bands on these gels were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue R 350, and the gels were also autoradiographed to reveal radioactive bands using the Bio-imaging Analyzer BAS-1500 (Fuji Medical Systems USA, Inc., Stamford, CT). The pI values of the Fab products were determined by comparing their bands to the standard bands with known pI. 2.4. Immunoreactivity The immunoreactivity of radiolabeled antibody fragments was determined by a modified cell-binding assay of Lindmo et al. [30]. Aliquots of the radiolabeled Fab (2.5 ng/100 L) were incubated for 2 hr at 4°C with 6.25 104 to 7.5 106 SP2/Tac cells. The maximum cell-bound counts, corrected for nonspecific binding and expressed as a percentage of the total counts, were taken to be the immunoreactivity.

2.5. Biodistribution studies in normal Balb/c mice Animal studies were performed under an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol. Groups of five female Balb/c mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN; 5 6 weeks old, 16 20 g) were used. The mice were injected via the tail vein with either nonglyco99m lated or glycolated Tc-MAG3-Fab (2.0 4.5 125 Ci/0.24 0.64 g) and I-Fab (1.0 2.0 Ci/0.07 0.29 g) in 0.2 mL of phosphate buffered saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The total dose of Fab injected was 0.31 0.93 g. The animals were euthanized with CO2 at 15, 45, 90, 180, and 360 min and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture before dissection. One group of five normal Balb/c mice was co-injected with 30 mg of L-lysine in the injectate and sacrificed at 15 min after the injection. Major organs, blood, and injected-dose standards were weighed, and the radioactivity was counted in a gamma counter (Packard Auto-Gamma, Meriden, CT). The percentage of the injected dose per gram (% ID/g) of tissue or blood was calculated and normalized to a 20-g mouse. 2.6. Biodistribution studies in tumor-bearing nude mice Female athymic nude mice (4 7 weeks old, 16 23 g, n 5) were used. Tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneous inoculation of 2 3 106 receptor-positive ATAC4 cells in the left flank and the receptor-negative A431 cells in the right flank. Experiments on tumor-bearing mice were performed at approximately 12 days after inoculation when the tumors weighed a mean of 374 mg (219 552 mg). The mice were injected via the tail vein with a mixture of either nonglycolated or glycolated 99mTcMAG3-Fab and 125I-Fab (0.31 0.93 g). The biodistribution study was performed as described above for the nontumor-bearing Balb/c mice. 2.7. Metabolite study Serum and urine samples from tumor-bearing nude mice injected with a mixture of either nonglycolated or glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab and 125I-Fab were collected and stored in an ice bath until analyzed. Size-exclusion HPLC equipped with a TSK G2000SW column (TosoHaas; 0.067 M PBS with 0.1 M KCl, pH 6.7; 1.0 mL/min) was used to separate radioproteins and radiocatabolites by molecular weight. Molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) ranging from 1.35 kD vitamin B12 to 670 kD thyroglobulin were used to estimate the molecular weight of the radioproducts. The radioactivity of 99mTc and 125I was determined by two flow-counters (Bioscan Inc., Washington, DC) connected in tandem for the detection of the two radionuclides.

2.8. Statistical analysis We performed the statistical analysis using the Student's t test with pairwise comparison (Sigmastat; Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA).

3. Results 3.1. Chemistry and immunoreactivity The preformed chelate approach to 99mTc labeling of the Fab involved three steps (Fig. 1): 1) Benzoyl-MAG3 was radiolabeled with 99mTc; 2) 99mTc-MAG3 was activated to its TFP ester; 3) 99mTc-MAG3-TFP was conjugated to Fab. The isoelectric focusing experiments demonstrated that the protein bands obtained with Coomassie Blue staining were superimposable on the radioactivity bands, indicating that the 99mTc labeling reflected the glycolate conjugation. The conjugation of a tracer amount of 99mTc-MAG3 or 125I labeling to Fab did not change the pI (9.3) of Fab. In contrast, the molar excess of TFP-glycolate lowered the pI to 4.6 6.6 for the 99mTc-labeled Fab and to 3.5 5.9 for the [125]I-Fab (Fig. 2). The glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab showed a comparable immunoreactivity (70%) to that of 125 I-Fab (78%), indicating the conjugation of 99mTc-MAG3 and TFP-glycolate to Fab did not significantly alter the immunoreactivity. 3.2. Biodistribution studies The biodistribution study of the nonglycolated and the glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab was performed first in Balb/c mice without tumors (Table 1). As an internal control, 125 I-Fab or the glycolated 125I-Fab was co-injected to assess run-to-run variations. Because the run-to-run variations for the 125I-labeled Fab were not significantly different from the results previously reported [27], the full biodistribution data for 125I-Fab and the glycolated 125I-Fab are not included in this paper. The biodistribution of 99mTc-MAG3-Fab was characterized by rapid, high renal uptake and gradual renal clearance (Table 1). Its renal uptake was similar to that of 131I-Fab [27]. The major difference between 99mTc-MAG3-Fab and 125 I-Fab was shown in the stomach, thyroid and blood where the 125I accumulation was higher than the 99mTc accumulation. This resulted in a higher whole-body retention of the 125I for a 6-hr period (42% ID/g for 125I label vs 18% ID/g for 99mTc label at 6 hr). This is consistent with our previous findings that 99mTc-MAG3-disulfide-stabilized variable region fragment (dsFv) [45] cleared out from the whole-body faster than 125I-dsFv [26]. The higher concentration of the 125I-labeled Fab in the stomach and thyroid is not surprising because these are the target organs for the radioiodide, whereas the99mTc-MAG3 catabolite does not accumulate in these organs and is excreted rapidly through

the renal system [25,26,28,45]. The size-exclusion HPLC also showed a substantial amount of the 125I catabolite in serum sample collected at 15 (6.1% of the total serum radioactivity) and 90 min (66.0% of the total serum radioactivity), whereas no 99mTc catabolite was detected in serum samples and almost all 99mTc radioactivity in urine collected at 15 and 90 min was bound to the 99mTc catabolite. We have previously analyzed the catabolites by reverse-phase HPLC and reverse-phase TLC, and reported that the lysine adducts of 99mTc-MAG3 and [125I] iodide, respectively, were the major catabolites [10,27,45]. Compared with the nonglycolated Fab, the glycolated 99m Tc-MAG3-Fab produced drastically lower renal uptake, especially at 15 min (31% ID/g for the glycolated vs 177% ID/g for the nonglycolated). This lower renal uptake was reflected in lower whole-body retention at 15 min, indicating that the glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab was excreted rapidly through the kidneys. A substantial amount (18% of the total urine radioactivity) of the intact glycolated 99mTcMAG3-Fab was found in the urine at 90 min whereas for the nonglycolated, all urine radioactivity was associated with the 99mTc catabolite even at 15 min. At the time points later than 90 min when the renal clearance rate is primarily determined by the clearance of the catabolite, the difference in the renal accumulation between the nonglycolated Fab and the glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab became much less significant (Table 1). It is interesting to note that a larger amount of radioactivity was retained in the whole-body for

the glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab than for the nonglycolated at 3 and 6 hr (Table 1). This higher whole-body retention parallels the higher retention of 99mTc radioactivity in the blood for the glycolated (1.2% ID/g for the glycolated vs 0.3% ID/g for the nonglycolated at 6 hr) (Table 1). The glycolation effect shown here with the glycolated 99mTcMAG3-Fab was similar to that shown with the glycolated 125 I-Fab [27]. Co-injecting 30 mg of L-lysine drastically reduced the renal accumulation of the nonglycolated Fab at 15 min (Fig. 3) to an extent comparable to that of the glycolation effects (Fig. 3). The lysine co-injection also drastically reduced the whole-body retention of the nonglycolated 99mTc-MAG3Fab (64% ID) at 15 min, substantially lower than the wholebody retention of the glycolated Fab without lysine coinjection (82% ID). The lower whole-body retention was also reflected in a large amount (98% of the total) of urinary radioactivity bound to the intact Fab at 15 min. This indicates that the lysine co-injection was very effective in blocking the tubular reabsorption. The renal accumulation at 15 min was further reduced by a combination of the glycolation and the lysine co-injection (31% ID/g for the glycolated alone vs 12% ID/g for the glycolated with lysine co-injection). To test the effect of the acylation on tumor targeting, the glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab and the nonglycolated 99mTcMAG3-Fab were compared in nude mice bearing IL-2R positive ATAC4 and IL-2R -negative A431 tumor cells.

The peak tumor uptake occurred at a time point between 90 and 180 min. The glycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab increased the peak tumor uptake value to 14.8% ID/g, compared with 8.3% ID/g for the nonglycolated 99mTc-MAG3-Fab and 4.2% ID/g for 125I-Fab (Fig. 4). This increased peak tumor

uptake due to the glycolation of 99mTc-MAG3-Fab was similar to that reported for the glycolated 125I-Fab [27]. Similar to the glycolation effect on the renal uptake in Balb/c mice, the renal uptake in the tumor-bearing nude mice was also drastically reduced at 15 min (Fig. 4).

4. Discussion Technetium-99m is a radionuclide of choice for scintigraphic imaging due to its favorable physical properties (a 140 KeV photon energy and a half-life of 6 hr), low cost, and good availability. Thus, the improvement in the renal clearance property of 99mTc-labeled Fab is very relevant for its efficient use in clinical studies. To improve the renal clearance property by chemical modifications, we first labeled Fab with a renal secretion agent 99mTc-MAG3 and then neutralized the positive charges of Fab by acylating the amino groups of Fab. We used TFP-glycolate as an acylating agent because the glycolate is a small molecule (MW 58) with a hydroxyl group. The conjugation with one glycolate molecule neutralizes one positive charge of the amino group and adds one hydrophilic hydroxyl group. Because the Fab has 28 lysine residues, the modification of the all lysine residues would increase the molecular weight by 1624 daltons that is only 3.2% of the molecular weight of Fab. Because there is generally an inverse relationship between the degree of chemical modification and the immunoreactivity of Fab, we glycolated Fab that decreased the pI to 4.6 6.6 without altering the immunoreactivity significantly. The effect of the glycolation on lowering the renal uptake and the wholebody retention was especially drastic at 15 min. The glycolation appears to inhibit the charge attraction to the negatively charged phospholipid bilayers of proximal tubular cells by neutralizing the positive charges of Fab. However, at the later time points when the renal clearance rate was primarily determined by the clearance of the catabolites, the difference in the renal concentration of the radioactivity became less pronounced between the glycolated and the nonglycolated (Table 1). This indicates that the 99mTc catabolites, the lysine adducts of 99mTc-MAG3, are readily excreted via the renal system. Thus, the glycolation effect on reducing the renal accumulation is effective at an early time point, whereas the radiolabeling using a renal secretion agent 99mTc-MAG3 becomes beneficial at the later time points. The glycolation showed an additional effect in increasing the maximum tumor uptake that was similar to the glycolation effect shown with 125I-Fab [27]. We think that the glycolation would be beneficial to other LMWPs for tumor targeting if their amino groups were non-essential to their biological activities. The glycolation would be especially useful for Fab fragments labeled with therapeutic radionuclides, with which high renal accumulation can cause a serious renal toxicity problem. This glycolation approach can be combined with the metabolizable linker approach of Arano and Saji et al. [14] where the peptide bond of a lysine-glycine linker inserted between Fab and m-[125I]iodobenzoyl moiety was cleaved by "brush border enzymes" on the lumen of tubules. The resulting catabolite m-[125I]iodohippuric acid was excreted rapidly into urine, thereby reducing the renal accumulation of the radioactivity. It is very probable that the combination of these two chemical modification methods would provide an additive effect on further reducing the renal accumulation of the radioactivity.

5. Conclusion This study provided a proof-of-principle that the combined method of the pharmacological blockage of renal uptake with lysine, the reduction of pI by chemical modification, and radiolabeling with a metal chelate that is excreted readily via the kidneys is very effective in lowering the renal accumulation. This combined method warrants further applications to Fab fragments labeled with therapeutic radionuclides to minimize the renal toxicity.
