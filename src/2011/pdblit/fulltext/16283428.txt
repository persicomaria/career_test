Key words: Bacillus subtilis, Berkeley Structural Genomics Center (BSGC), crystal structure, GI16080818, phosphotransacetylase, structural genomics Abstract Phosphotransacetylase (Pta) [EC 2.3.1.8] plays a major role in acetate metabolism by catalyzing the reversible transfer of the acetyl group between coenzyme A (CoA) and orthophosphate: CH3COS CoA+HPO2À !CH3COOPO32)+CoASH. In this study, we report the crystal structures of Pta from 4 ° ° Bacillus subtilis at 2.75 A resolution and its complex with acetyl phosphate, one of its substrates, at 2.85 A resolution. In addition, the Pta activity of the enzyme has been assayed. The enzyme folds into an a/b architecture with two domains separated by a prominent cleft, very similar to two other known Pta structures. The enzyme­acetyl phosphate complex structure reveals a few potential substrate binding sites. Two of them are located in the middle of the interdomain cleft: each one is surrounded by a region of strictly and highly conserved residues. High structural similarities are found with 4-hydroxythreonine-4phosphate dehydrogenase (PdxA), and isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases, all of which utilize NADP+ as their cofactor, which binds in the interdomain cleft. Their substrate binding sites are close to the acetyl phosphate binding sites of Pta in the cleft as well. These results suggest that the CoA is likely to bind to the interdomain cleft of Pta in a similar way as NADP+ binds to the other three enzymes.

Introduction Phosphotransacetylase (Pta) [EC 2.3.1.8] catalyzes the reversible transfer of the acetyl group between coenzyme A (CoA) and orthophosphate:  CH3COSCoA+HPO2À !CH3COOPO32)+CoA 4 SH. Acetyl-coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) is a central metabolic intermediate tied directly to all anabolic processes. Acetyl phosphate and ADP can be converted to acetate and ATP by acetate kinase (Ack) [EC 2.7.2.1]: CH3COOPO32)+ADP  !CH3COO)+ATP. Acetate is an end product

in the energy-yielding metabolism of most anaerobic microbes. Present in all fermentative anaerobes, these two enzymes together play a central role in acetate metabolism that is of importance to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Although the mechanism of Pta remains unknown, a few biochemical studies and two crystal structures have been reported for Pta. A kinetic mechanism involving a ternary complex for Pta from Clostridlum kluyveri has been proposed [1] and several essential residues have been identified for the Methanosarcina thermophila enzyme

270 [2, 3]. One crystal structure was solved for Pta from M. thermophila, an anaerobic archaeon [4], and the other one for a putative Pta from Streptococcus pyogenes [5], a gram-positive aerotolerant anaerobic bacterium, whose Pta activity has been experimentally verified (see below). These two enzymes have 44% sequence identity and their structures are very similar as well. BS1347, a target of Berkeley Structural Genomics Center (BSGC), is a Pta found in Bacillus subtilis, a widespread gram-positive aerobic bacterium. BS1347 (hereafter referred to as B. subtilis Pta) shares high sequence identity with all other Ptas reported from both the Bacterial and the Archaeal domains (BLAST search results, data not shown). Evidence has been presented that NADH and pyruvate, inhibitors of the Escherichia coli enzyme, have no effect on the activity of B. subtilis Pta [6]. In addition, it has been shown that B. subtilis Pta is capable of cleaving other short chain CoA esters besides acetyl-CoA, such as propionyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA, but is unable to hydrolyze either succinyl-CoA or the long chain fatty acyl CoA, palmityl-CoA [6]. Here we report the crystal structures of Pta from B. subtilis and its complex with acetyl phosphate, one of the substrates of the enzyme, as well as its enzymatic function. DNA analysis and transformed into BL21(DE3)/ pSJS1244 for protein expression [7]. Protein expression and purification His-MBP-Pta fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli using auto-inducing media (Dr. William Studier, Brookhaven National Laboratory, personal communication). The cells were grown at 37 °C until OD600 of 0.5 and allowed to grow overnight at 20 °C. After harvesting and resuspending in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl, and 5% glycerol, the cells were lysed by microfluidization (Microfluidics, Newton, MA), and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall centrifuge. The supernatant was then spun in a Beckman ultracentrifuge Ti45 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The clear lysate was supplemented with 10 mM imidazole before being applied to a 5 ml HiTrap Metal Chelating (Ni++) column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The protein was eluted with a 10 column-volume (CV) linear gradient from 10 to 300 mM imidazole in the same buffer. The fusion protein eluted at 300 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, and 5% glycerol in the presence of TEV protease. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a 5 ml HiTrap Metal Chelating (Ni++) column. The cleaved recombinant protein was found in the flow through. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) as the final step of purification. The purity of the expressed protein was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The protein was concentrated in an Amicon Ultra 10 K unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in buffer containing 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.3 M NaCl to a final concentration of 16 mg/ml. Crystallization Screening for crystallization conditions was performed using the sparse matrix sampling method [8] with commercially prepared screening kits (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). The optimal condition was found to be 0.1 M BisTris propane, pH 7.0, and 2.5 M ammonium sulfate using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method

Material and methods Cloning The sequence encoding the B. subtilis Pta was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from B. subtilis genomic DNA (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) using Deep Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The resulting PCR product was purified, and was prepared for ligation independent cloning by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 mM dTTP for 30 min at 37 °C. The prepared DNA was then mixed with pB4 vector for 5 min at room temperature and transformed into DH5a. This pB4 vector, a derivative of pET (Novagen, Madison, WI), was designed in our laboratory to express the target protein together with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag-Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) fusion containing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Clones were screened by plasmid

at room temperature. Crystals grew within a week to dimensions of about 0.3 Â 0.1 Â 0.1 mm. The crystals were transferred to a drop of paraffin oil as cryoprotectant for about 10 s before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and exposed to X-ray. Enzyme­acetyl phosphate complex crystals were obtained by soaking the native crystals in the mother liquor supplemented with 50 mM acetyl phosphate for 5­6 h before being harvested into a drop of paraffin oil. Structure determination and refinement The single wavelength X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Macromolecular Crystallography facility beam line 5.0.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory equipped with a Quantum 4 CCD detector (Area Detector System Corporation, Poway, CA). The oscillation angle per

image was 0.2° and 0.25° for the native crystal and the enzyme­acetyl phosphate complex crystal, respectively. The diffraction data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL program suite [9]. The data statistics are summarized in Table 1. The native structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR) with CNS [10] using the crystal structure of Pta from S. pyogenes (PDB code 1R5J) as the search model. Six monomers within the asymmetric unit were positioned through MR. The refinement of the initial solutions with CNS [10] yielded significantly improved electron density maps suitable for sequence assignment and model building with O [11]. Subsequent refinements were carried out in CNS [10] and REFMAC5 [12] against the data ° ° between 20 A and 2.75 A, and reached convergence after several alternating cycles of manual

272 building and refinement. The refined native structure was then used as a parent structure to determine the position of the acetyl phosphate in the enzyme­acetyl phosphate complex by difference Fourier maps. The complex structure was finally ° refined to 2.85 A resolution. For both structures, TLS refinement was performed in which each monomer was divided into two TLS groups corresponding to domains I and II. NCS restraints among the six monomers were applied throughout the refinement and modified as guided by the behavior of Rfree. Sulfate and acetyl phosphate molecules were added manually. Their topology and parameter files were obtained from the HICUp database [13]. The refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. Atomic coordinates have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with access code 1TD9 for the native structure and 1XCO for the enzyme­acetyl phosphate complex structure. Phosphotransacetylase activity assay Phosphotransacetylase activity was assayed in an enzyme-coupled assay by measuring the NADH formation at 340 nm as described previously [14]. The standard reaction mixture (250 lL) contained 25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 4 mM acetyl phosphate, 0.3 mM CoA, 5 mmol NAD, 5 mM malic acid, 0.5 units of citrate synthase, 0.6 units of malate dehydrogenase, and 1.0 lg of Pta. The absorbance at 340 nm was read using the Quant Universal Microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). For determination of kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, the reaction mixture (50 ll) contained 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 0.06 ­ 6.0 mM acetyl phosphate, 0.6 ­ 80 lM CoA, 0.8 mM NAD, 5 mM malic acid, 0.4 units of citrate synthase, 0.3 units of malate dehydrogenase, and 0.1 lg of Pta. For saturations, the phosphotransacetylase activity was measured in the presence of fixed concentrations of one substrate (2.5 mM acetyl phosphate or 50 lM CoA) and variable concentrations of another substrate. Kinetic parameters were estimated from non-linear curve fitting using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA; http://www.graphpad.com). Results and discussion Overall structure of the native B. subtilis Pta The native B. subtilis Pta enzyme crystallized in a primitive hexagonal space group P6422 and the structure was determined by molecular replace° ment (MR) at 2.75 A resolution using the crystal structure of S. pyogenes Pta (PDB code 1R5J) as the search model. There are six monomers per asymmetric unit, including two homodimers (AB dimer and CD dimer) and two monomers (Monomer E and F). Since the structures of these six monomers are essentially identical (rms devia° tion = 0.15­0.20 A for 323 residues) and the A monomer is best defined in the electron density maps as reflected by its average temperature fac° tors of 44.8 A2 (compared to 51.5, 47.0, 52.4, 50.1 ° 2 for Monomers B, C, D, E, and F, and 73.4 A respectively), only the A monomer and AB dimer will be discussed unless otherwise mentioned. Overall, the topology of the B. subtilis Pta monomer is very similar to its homologue from S. pyogenes [5] (PDB code 1R5J) (Figure 1a). Each monomer is built into an a/b structure and consists of two domains (I and II) with main chain dimensions of approximately 66Â 46Â ° 31 A. Domain I (residues 1­142 and 295­323) forms an a)b)a structure, with a strictly parallel five-stranded b-sheet in the middle ``sandwiched'' by a-helices on each side. It contains the N- and C-terminal segments, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-like nucleotide-binding fold (Rossmann fold) [15], and a helical subdomain consisting of four a-helices. Domain II (residues 143­294) also adopts a typical a)b)a sandwich structure with a mixed six-stranded b-sheet that is embraced by three helices on one side and two helices on the other side. The two domains are separated by a distinct cleft, running along the junction between the two b-sheets that have a remarkable left-handed twist of approximately 200°. Similar to S. pyogenes Pta, the B. subtilis enzyme also forms dimers in the crystal exclusively via Domain II (Figure 1b). In the asymmetric unit, Monomers A and B, and Monomers C and D form two separate dimers, while Monomer E and Monomer F form dimers with their crystallographic symmetric related counterparts. The

dimerization modes are almost identical for the two enzymes: a12 helix (residues 269­281 in B. subtilis Pta) runs roughly parallel to the dimer axis and makes close contacts with the corresponding helix of the other monomer; it also interacts with a few residues right before a9 helix (residues 212­227 in B. subtilis Pta), and residues in a10 helix (residues 239­243 in B. subtilis Pta) in the other monomer. The surface area buried ° upon dimer formation calculated using a 1.4 A ° probe radius is 1420 A2 or $10% of the total surface area of each monomer. Structural comparison with other Pta structures To date, two crystal structures have been determined for Pta: one from M. thermophila [4] (PDB code 1QZT) and the other from S. pyogenes [5] (PDB code 1R5J). The structure-based alignment of amino acid sequences for B. subtilis, S. pyogenes, and M. thermophila enzymes is shown in Figure 2. The sequence identity between the enzymes from B. subtilis and S. pyogenes is 60%, and that between B. subtilis and M. thermophila enzymes is 46%. S. pyogenes Pta differs from B. subtilis Pta by 2 extra residues at the N-terminal end, 4 extra residues at the C-terminal end, and a 2-residue insertion between strands b5 and b6. In the case of the M. thermophila enzyme, it has a 2-residue deletion right after the a3 helix, a 1-residue insertion between

helices a4 and a5, a 6-residue insertion between strands b5 and b6, a 1-residue insertion in the a8 helix, and 4 extra residues at the C-terminal end. Comparison of the three Pta crystal structures revealed that their structures are very similar and all of them form homodimers with a similar dimerization mode. This result was not surprising due to the high sequence identity amongst them. Superimposition of B. subtilis Pta monomer and its equivalent from S. pyogenes (PDB code 1R5J) resulted in the alignment of all 323 ° residues with an rms deviation of only 1.0 A. In the crystal structure of M. thermophila Pta (PDB code 1QZT), the four monomers in the two dimers in the asymmetric unit adopt different conformations [4]. Monomer A and B in the AB dimer are present in an open and a closed conformation, respectively, while the monomers of the CD dimer are more similar to Monomer A, but represent an intermediate conformation. However, this kind of conformation difference is not observed in B. subtilis Pta, in which the structures of six monomers in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical as stated above. Superimpositions of Monomer A of B. subtilis Pta and the four monomers of the M. thermophila homologue showed that the conformation of the B. subtilis Pta monomer is closer to that of Monomer C and D of M. thermophila Pta with rms deviations of 1.4 and ° 1.3 A, respectively, for 321 residues.

The strictly and highly conserved residues are indicated in purple and orange, respectively, which is based on the alignment among 32 prokaryotic Pta sequences made by Iyer et al. [4]. Dashes represent gaps.

Structure of Pta­acetyl phosphate complex Pta catalyzes the reversible transfer of the acetyl group between coenzyme A (CoA) and orthophosphate. To investigate the mechanism of this enzyme, crystals of the enzyme­acetyl phosphate complex were obtained by soaking the native crystals in the mother liquor supplemented with 50 mM acetyl phosphate for 5­6 h. The position of the acetyl phosphate was determined by difference electron density maps. The complex structure ° was subsequently refined at 2.85 A resolution. Similar to the native structure, only the A monomer and AB dimer will be discussed for the complex structure due to the essentially identical structures of the six monomers in the asymmetric ° unit (rms deviation = 0.14­0.21 A for 323 residues).

The structure of the Pta monomer in the complex highly resembles that of the native enzyme. The rms deviation for all main chain atoms ° between the two structures is only 0.2 A, suggesting that no significant structural changes occurred upon the binding of acetyl phosphate to the enzyme. The main chain and side chain conformations of those strictly and highly conserved residues [4] (Figure 2) were further compared in detail between the two structures. Likewise, no distinct conformational changes were observed. From the complex structure, it was found that each monomer has four acetyl phosphate molecules bound (except for Monomer F which has three ordered and one poorly ordered acetyl phosphates), while in the native structure, almost all of these binding sites are occupied by sulfate ions (Figures 3, 4a and 4b). Amongst the four

275 juxtaposed to the first one in the interdomain cleft but in the reverse orientation and closer to Domain II (dimerization domain) (Figure 4c). Its carbonyl oxygen makes bifurcate hydrogen bonds with the side chain amine group of Lys251¢ (where the prime denotes the second subunit in the dimer) and a water molecule (Wat678) that is also in contact with a phosphate oxygen atom of the first acetyl phosphate molecule. The O2 atom is involved in bifurcate hydrogen bonds as well, with side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr276 and Nn atom of Lys277 situated on a12 helix (an alternative for Tyr276 is to form a hydrogen bond with the phosphate oxygen atom O1P). The third bifurcate hydrogen bonds are formed between the phosphate oxygen atom O2P and the side chain amino groups of Asn273 and Gln238¢. Of notable interest is that similar to the first acetyl phosphate, all residues mentioned above that interact with the second acetyl phosphate molecule are either strictly conserved (Lys251, Asn273 and Lys277) or highly conserved (Gln238 and Tyr276) in prokaryotic Pta [4] (Figure 2). In addition, the second acetyl phosphate is in contact with the residues from both monomers in the dimer. The other two acetyl phosphate molecules are bound near the lower entrance into the cleft, which harbors a number of positively charged residues (Figure 4a). One (UVW401) forms a salt bridge with Arg88, while the other one (UVW402) interacts with Lys92 and Arg89, a residue highly conserved in Pta sequences (Figure 2). It is noteworthy that Arg89 corresponds to Arg87 of M. thermophila Pta that has been demonstrated to interact with the 3¢-phosphate of CoA, the other substrate of the enzyme. Structure implications The search for structural homologues of both S. pyogenes Pta and M. thermophila Pta has revealed that isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases have high structural homology with Pta despite the low sequence identity [4, 5]. Structural comparisons of B. subtilis Pta with other protein structures carried out using the program DALI [16] against updated structure database not only presented the same results, but also found two additional structures with even higher structural similarities (Figure 5). The first

acetyl phosphate molecules, two of them are very close to each other and are located in the middle of the cleft between the two domains (Figure 4c). The one closer to Domain I (UVW418) can form ° hydrogen bonds (distance cutoff of <3.2 A was used throughout the paper) through its phosphate oxygen atoms with the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser303 and the main chain amino group of Arg304, which are both strictly conserved residues in prokaryotic Pta [4] and are located on the loop connecting b11 strand and a13 helix. In addition, its O2 atom makes a hydrogen bond with Ne atom of Arg304, and its carbonyl oxygen may form a hydrogen bond with the side chain oxygen of Thr129, a highly conserved residue as well, despite the nonideal hydrogen bond angle in the current model. The second acetyl phosphate (UVW406) is roughly

Acetyl phosphates bound to Pta, and NADP+ and isopropylmalate bound to isocitrate dehydrogenase are shown in bond representation. The Mg2+ ion bound to isocitrate dehydrogenase is depicted as a gray sphere.

277 one is a fatty acid/phospholipid synthesis protein plsX, also from B. subtilis (PDB code 1VI1, ° Z = 20.9, r.m.s. deviation of 3.1 A for 246 Ca atoms), and the other one is 4-hydroxythreonine4-phosphate dehydrogenase from E. coli (PdxA, E.C. 1.1.1.262), an enzyme involved in the pyridoxal phosphate biosynthesis pathway [17] (PDB ° code 1PS6, Z = 15.2, r.m.s. deviation of 3.7 A for 240 Ca atoms). The superimposition of B. subtilis Pta with these two proteins showed that structural equivalents can be found for all 11 bstrands, and 10 and 9 out of a total of 13 a-helices of Pta in plsX and PdxA, respectively. Despite the high structural homology, the amino acid sequence similarity between B. subtilis Pta and these two proteins is limited as the structurebased pairwise sequence identity is only 19% and 14% for plsX and PdxA, respectively. Except for plsX, three other structural homologues of Pta, all hydrogenases, form homodimers in crystals with overall similar dimerization interface to Pta, which involve the same regions of the proteins. More interestingly, with the detailed function of plsX unknown, the other three hydrogenases all catalyze analogous decarboxylate dehydrogenations of 3-hydroxy acids and utilize NADP+ as their cofactor, whose 5¢-adenosine diphosphate moiety is very similar to CoA. The extrapolation of the NADP+ binding site of isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases onto the native Pta structure has indicated that the most likely binding site for CoA is in the interdomain cleft, near a few strictly and highly conserved residues [4]. Now the structure of the enzyme­acetyl phosphate complex reinforces this hypothesis. If we superimpose the NADP+ and isopropylmalate molecule in the structure of isocitrate dehydrogenase complexed with isopropylmalate and NADP+ (PDB code 1HJ6) onto the Pta­acetyl phosphate complex structure, we notice that the adenosine part of NADP+ binds to the upper portion of the cleft, while the rest of the molecule extends roughly along the cleft and reaches the positions of the two bound acetyl phosphate molecules in the cleft (Figure 6). In addition, these two acetyl phosphate binding sites of Pta are quite close to the substrate binding site of all three dehydrogenases. It can therefore be postulated that CoA may bind to Pta in a similar way and its sulfhydryl group would be in a position near two acetyl phosphate molecules. Given the fact that all residues interacting with the two bound substrate molecules are strictly or highly conserved, one or both of these two binding sites

is likely to be the genuine substrate binding site for the reaction. However, whether this is true cannot be resolved at this point due to the lack of biochemical evidence. Phosphotransacetylase activity of the B. subtilis Pta So far, two structures whose sequences were annotated as a putative Pta (SP1324) [5] and as a Pta (BS1347, described in this paper) have been determined at BSGC. Both structures are very similar to the structure of M. thermophila Pta whose phosphotransacetylase activity has been well characterized [18], confirming structurally their sequence annotations. To experimentally verify the annotated function, phosphotransacetylase activity assay on both proteins has been performed. Ptas are rather conserved enzymes with 45% to 90% of overall sequence identity. B. subtilis Pta (BS1347) shows significant sequence similarity to the putative Pta (SP1324) from S. pyogenes (60% of sequence identity) and to known Ptas from various bacteria (40% to 90% of sequence identity). Purified B. subtilis Pta demonstrated high phosphotransacetylase activity (measured in the direction of acetyl-CoA formation) with a maximum at pH 8.0 (data not shown). Specific activity of this enzyme (Table 2) was within the range of activities reported previously for homologous enzymes from other organisms (8­2496 lmoles/ min mg protein) [18]. With CoA as a variable substrate, the enzyme showed classical Michaelis­ Menten saturation kinetics (Figure 7), whereas sigmoidal saturations kinetics (kH=1.93) was observed for acetyl phosphate indicating positive cooperativity in acetyl phosphate binding. When compared to known Ptas (BRENDA database), the enzyme from B. subtilis had the highest affinity to CoA (Km=1.3 lM) (Table 2). The affinity of the B. subtilis Pta to acetyl phosphate was within the range reported for other Ptas [18, 19] and more than 400 times lower than its affinity to

CoA (Table 2). We also found phosphotransacetylase activity in the putative Pta from S. pyogenes, but it was significantly lower than that of B. subtilis Pta (45­70 lmoles/min mg protein). The S. pyogenes Pta had also lower affinity to CoA (Km=35 lM), but similar affinity to acetyl phosphate (0.52 mM). Thus, our enzymatic data provided direct experimental confirmation of the presence of phosphotransacetylase activity in uncharacterized Ptas from B. subtilis and S. pyogenes. Altogether, three Pta structures have been determined so far from M. thermophila, S. pyogenes and B. subtilis. The first one is an archaea protein, while the latter two are bacterial proteins.

Figure 7. Phosphotransacetylase activity of BS1347 as a function of (a) CoA or (b) acetyl phosphate concentration. Reactions were performed as described in Materials and methods in the presence of saturating concentrations of the second substrate: (a) 2.5 mM acetyl phosphate; (b) 50 lM CoA.

279 Considering the high levels of sequence homology among Ptas and the similarities of all three structures, it is likely that the Pta structure is well conserved in various microbes. Pta presents high structural similarities with three dehydrogenases, including 4-hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (PdxA), and isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases, all of which utilize NADP+ as their cofactor. In addition, the acetyl phosphate binding sites in the interdomain cleft revealed by the structure of Pta­acetyl phosphate complex are close to the substrate binding site of the three dehydrogenases. All of these observations suggest that the CoA is most likely to bind to the interdomain cleft, similar to the NADP+ binding mode of those three dehydrogenases. Whereas all of these results shed new light on the structural basis for our understanding of the enzyme, more biochemical and structural studies are needed to elucidate its mechanism. References
