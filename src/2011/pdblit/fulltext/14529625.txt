Glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b) is involved in glycogen metabolism, neuronal cell development, osteoblast differentiation. Small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3b have various therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetes type II, bipolar disorders, stroke and chronic inflammatory disease. To identify GSK-3b inhibitors with novel scaffold from chemical library, we primarily screened out putative inhibitors through computer modeling and subsequently evaluated the inhibitory activity of selected compounds against GSK-3b by in vitro Z'-LYTETM assay. A series of compound KRMs strongly inhibited phosphorylation of its substrate with IC50 value of approximately 0.5 lM. Also, we demonstrated that KRM-189 and KRM-191 competed with ATP for GSK-3b, leading to decreased Vmax and constant Km with increasing concentrations of ATP as determined from Lineweaver­Berk equation. Moreover, they showed the selectivity for GSK-3b over other kinases with IC50 values of 2 to 10 lM or more Incubation of cells with KRM-191 with highly selective and potent inhibitory activity caused accumulation of b-catenin, downstream of GSK-3b signaling pathway, indicating that small molecule can prevent degradation of b-catenin via GSK-3b inhibition. Our results suggest that modeling in combination with in vitro assays can be used for the identification of selective and potent inhibitors. Ó 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a cytoplasmic serine­ threonine kinase and exists in two highly homologous forms, GSK3a and GSK-3b.1 Especially, GSK-3b plays a key role in signaling pathway transmitted by insulin or Wnt, which has been implicated in glucose homeostasis, remodeling of bone mass or developmental process of the embryo.2 GSK-3b is constitutively active in resting cells and treatment of cells with agents, such as insulin and lithium chloride (LiCl), is shown to cause GSK-3 inactivation through a PI 3kinase (PI3-K)-dependent mechanism. PI3-K-induced activation of PKB/Akt results in phosphorylation of Ser21 on GSK-3a and Ser9 on GSK-3b, therefore leading to the inhibition of GSK-3 activity. The phosphorylated N-terminus becomes a primed pseudosubstrate that occupies the positive binding pocket and the active site of the enzyme and acts as a competitive inhibitor for true substrates. Several known GSK-3 substrates participate in a wide network of cellular processes, including glycogen metabolism, transcription, translation, cytoskeletal regulation, intracellular vesicular transport, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation of these substrates by GSK-3b usually has an inhibitory effect. Arg96 is shown to be a crucial component of the positive pocket that binds primed substrates. Small molecule inhibitors that fit in the posi-

tively charged pocket of the kinase domain of GSK-3b are useful for selectively inhibiting primed substrates. Therefore, intervention of GSK-3b might be a useful target to the treatment and prevention of diabetes, Alzheimer and osteoporosis. Up to date, a few compounds are known to inhibit directly its enzyme. Lithium chloride has a specific inhibitory activity in vitro and in intact cells although millimolar concentration of IC50 is limited to therapeutic use. Besides, small molecules such as bisindole or aniline maleimides, kenpaullone, indirubin, or the marine natural product hymenialdisine have been reported as GSK-3b inhibitors.3 All the small molecules under development inhibit in a competitive manner with ATP and as a result, show no selectivity over a wide variety of protein kinases. In this presentation, we found out a scaffold structure of thiadiazolinone (TDZD) that might be a putative inhibitor of GSK-3b through running computer modeling, and furthermore synthesized TDZD derivatives to address moiety of which could be attributing to their inhibitory activity. Addition of some groups to parent chemical improved potently inhibitory activity against GSK-3b in enzyme assay. It also inhibited enzyme by competing with ATP, but has the selective inhibition for GSK-3b over other serine/threonine kinases. In a bioassay measuring b-catenin accumulation as a result of GSK-3b inhibition, it showed that b-catenin was still accumulated in the total cell extracts as did insulin or lithium chloride in this experiment. Taken together, computer modeling will provide a useful tool for the primary identification of scaffolding structure fitted into binding pocket of enzyme with known structure.

To virtually screen out putative ligands that are capable of acting as inhibitors of GSK-3b from in-house chemical library, we employed SurflexDock4 method interfaced with Sybyl 7.3.1.5 SurflexDock4 is a new docking methodology that combines Hammerhead's empirical scoring function6 with a molecular similarity method to generate putative alignment of ligands. It4 employs an idealized active site ligand (called a protomol) as a target to gener-

ate putative alignments of molecules or molecules fragments. These putative poses are achieved using the Hammerhead scoring function.6 Initially, in-house library including 170 compounds with TDZD fragment as a small molecule library, synthesized from diverse isocyanates and isothiocyanates via known method7 as shown in Scheme 1,8 was docked into binding sites of GSK-3b. Before performing docking, all compounds were minimized using Cerius29 suite of programs and the conserved water molecule (W82 as shown in Fig. 1) was also specified near Thr138 side chain atom and Asp200 backbone atom, which can play a crucial role in inhibitor binding. In an attempt to find out small molecules having an inhibition activity against GSK-3b using SurflexDock,4 PDB ID 1R0E as a

complex reference structure was adopted. Using active site extracted from 1R0E as PDE ID, we generated a protomol as an idealized active site ligand. SurflexDock's protomols utilize CH4, C@O and NH fragments. Protomol construction was based on protein residues proximal to the native ligand and on parameter settings to produce a small and buried docking target (SurflexDock parameters: proto_thresh 0.6 and proto_bloat 0). Each docking of putative ligands returned up to 50 scored poses, with the score consisting of a nominal affinity score.6 Through SurflexDock method, we chose the pose with best score from multiple docking of the same ligand. Out of 170 compounds, five compounds were finally selected after considering a structural diversity and docking score. The best pose of the chosen ligands and their resulting scores are shown in Table 1. To further investigate inhibitory potency of some derivatives with thiadiazolidinones (TDZD) chosen through computer modeling for the inhibitors of GSK-3b, we performed Z'-LYTETM kinase assay,11 in which ratiometric fluorescence transfer between substrate and product was reproducibly determined. Inhibition of GSK-3b by each compound was shown in Figure 2 by plotting relative inhibition of enzyme at increasing doses of compound. IC50 values that are indicative of inhibitory activity of each compound were summarized in Table 2. In vitro enzymatic data showed that five compounds had their distinctive IC50 values with a similar inhibitory potency at a fixed concentration. Scaffold with benzyl and ethyl group as substituents exhibited low IC50 value, similar

to value reported previously.3 Derivatives with different combination of substituent groups had different IC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 2 lM. To delineate the inhibitory mechanism of compounds with most potent inhibitory activity under investigation (KRM-189 and KRM-191), kinetic experiment was carried out under different concentrations of ATP and TDZD derivative. Double-reciprocal plot of kinetic profiles was shown in Figure 3a and b. Lineweaver Burk plot suggests that either KRM-189 or -191 was demonstrated to be a typical competitive inhibition against substrate ATP, indicating that chemical derivatives share binding pocket of enzyme with ATP. With increasing concentrations of ATP, it displayed intersection of same Vmax and different Km values. A parent compound (KRM-7777) has been reported to inhibit GSK-3b selectivity over other protein kinases independent of ATP concentration. Therefore, TDZD with some modification might shift inhibition mode from noncompetitive to competitive while improving the inhibitory competency. Due to its involvement of GSK-3b in multiple pathways as described above, selectivity of GSK-3b inhibition is one of a considerable important factor in the development of inhibitors for therapeutic applications. Since GSK-3b is supposed to be phylogenetically most close to cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs),12 it is compelling to achieve selectivity against CDKs. Moreover, structural and functional similarities between GSK-3b and casein kinase 2 (CK2) were suggested on phylogenetic trees.13 PKA or PKC

Some other serine/ threonine kinases were tested with chemicals to inhibit potently GSK-3b. All the reaction conditions were almost similar with exception of substrates suitable for respective enzyme, and were carried out according to the instructions provided by manufacturer.

As an internal standard, b-actin was detected by probing blotted membrane with anti b-actin.

insulin (Fig. 4). b-Catenin was continuously degraded under normal differentiation, resulting in lower level. Well-known GSK3b inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl) as well as insulin, which activate insulin signaling to indirectly inactivate GSK-3b, has been suggested to protect b-catenin from proteasome degradation. This biological data shows that in vitro activity of KRM-191 is reflected to b-catenin accumulation in cells left treated with KRM-191. Taken together, this report exhibits one typical example of drug development through docking virtual screening leading to potent inhibitors. After well-defined target and optimized algorithm package are established, introduction of in silico modeling into drug discovery and development pipeline will enrich the fraction of drug-like compounds in library, resulting in the reduction of biological testing in lead discovery. This process has already been included in drug discovery pipeline of pharmaceutical company.

belongs to be different from superfamily including GSK-3b on the human kinome tree. Therefore, selective inhibition of TDZD derivatives against GSK-3b was examined over other related kinases using Z'-LYTE substrate. In our inhibition data, unexpectedly, neither CDK2 nor CK2 were affected at even high concentrations of chemical derivatives whereas two serine/threonine kinases distinct from GSK-3b such as PKC and PKA were susceptible to inhibition by TDZD derivatives. Two potent compounds were 10-fold more selective for GSK-3b over PKC and PKA and 2 order more selective over CSNK2 and CDK1. To further examine downstream event of GSK inhibition in the intact cells, b-catenin accumulation following GSK-3b inhibitor treatment was followed with reference to lithium chloride and
