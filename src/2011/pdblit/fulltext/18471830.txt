Bacteria producing endonuclease colicins are protected against their cytotoxic activity by virtue of a small immunity protein that binds with high af®nity and speci®city to inactivate the endonuclease. DNase binding by the immunity protein occurs through a ``dual recognition'' mechanism in which conserved residues from helix III act as the binding-site anchor, while variable residues from helix II de®ne speci®city. We now report Ê the 1.7 A crystal structure of the 24.5 kDa complex formed between the endonuclease domain of colicin E9 and its cognate immunity protein Im9, which provides a molecular rationale for this mechanism. Conserved residues of Im9 form a binding-energy hotspot through a combination of backbone hydrogen bonds to the endonuclease, many via buried solvent molecules, and hydrophobic interactions at the core of the interface, while the speci®city-determining residues interact with corresponding speci®city side-chains on the enzyme. Comparison between the present structure and that reported recently for the colicin E7 endonuclease domain in complex with Im7 highlights how speci®city is achieved by very different interactions in the two complexes, predominantly hydrophobic in nature in the E9-Im9 complex but charged in the E7-Im7 complex. A key feature of both complexes is the contact between a conserved tyrosine residue from the immunity proteins (Im9 Tyr54) with a speci®city residue on the endonuclease directing it toward the speci®city sites of the immunity protein. Remarkably, this tyrosine residue and its neighbour (Im9 Tyr55) are the pivots of a 19  rigid-body rotation that relates the positions of Im7 and Im9 in the two complexes. This rotation does not affect conserved immunity protein interactions with the endonuclease but results in different regions of the speci®city helix being presented to the enzyme.

Introduction
The average buried surface area for a proteinÊ protein complex ($1600 A2) is similar to that of a protein-DNA complex (Nadassy et al., 1999; Lo Conte et al., 1999). However, our understanding of speci®city in protein-protein complexes lags behind that of protein-DNA interactions, even though the potential for diverse speci®cities in inter-protein complexes is signi®cantly greater, given that their

af®nities can span a scale of 12 orders of magnitude (Wallis et al., 1995b). In protein-DNA interactions, the topology of the complex usually indicates how speci®city is achieved, since discrete elements of secondary structure, such as a-helices or b-strands, are able to dock into the major groove of double-stranded DNA in order to distinguish cognate from non-cognate sequences (Luisi, 1995; Jones et al., 1999). Such a ``topological read-out'' mechanism is rarely adopted by protein-protein complexes (serine proteinase inhibitors being a notable exception), whose interfaces generally do not display any regular topology that might

Moreover, given the problem of presenting a potentially large binding surface of a protein that may be composed of several noncontiguous elements of secondary structure (Tsai et al., 1996), the question arises as to how conserved amino acids, which for example may form part of the structural framework, can be accommodated at the interface and yet still achieve speci®c recognition? Complexes formed between the endonuclease domains of bacterial colicins and their immunity proteins have provided a powerful model in which to address speci®city in protein-protein recognition (Kleanthous et al., 1998). Endonuclease colicins are 582 amino acid residue, plasmid-encoded protein antibiotics released by Escherichia coli into the extracellular medium in the form of a noncovalent, heterodimeric complex with an immunity protein during times of nutrient or environmental stress. They in®ltrate related organisms by binding to the vitamin B12 receptor in the outer membrane and, through interactions with the Tol protein complex in the periplasm and inner membrane, translocate their 15 kDa C-terminal DNase domain into the cytoplasm, jettisoning their bound immunity protein while doing so (for reviews, see James et al., 1996; Lazdunski et al., 1998). Four DNase colicins have been identi®ed that utilize this import route, colicins E2, E7, E8 and E9, and these share $65 % sequence identity in their DNase domains. Immunity proteins are 9.5 kDa, distorted four-helical bundle proteins (Osborne et al., 1996; Chak et al., 1996; Dennis et al., 1998) that associate with a colicin endonuclease domain to neutralise the activity of the toxin in the producing host and so avoid suicide of the bacterium (James et al., 1996; Kleanthous et al., 1998). Each DNase colicin is inhibited by a speci®c immunity protein, Im2, Im7, Im8 and Im9, respectively, forming a family that shares $50 % sequence identity. As well as serving as paradigms in studies of molecular recognition, immunity proteins are proving valuable in protein folding studies, since different immunity proteins fold by different mechanisms, even though family members share a high degree of sequence and structure conservation (Ferguson et al., 1999). The equilibrium dissociation constant for the E9 DNase-Im9 complex has been determined both for the isolated domain and the intact colicin as 10À16 M in the absence of salt, providing bacterial cells with complete protection towards colicin E9 (Wallis et al., 1995a). Non-cognate colicin E9-immunity protein associations are known to occur with in vitro binding af®nities six to ten orders of magnitude weaker than the cognate complex but that nonetheless inactivate the DNase (Wallis et al., 1995b). When the intracellular immunity protein concentration in a bacterium is suf®ciently high, this non-cognate binding leads to in vivo cross-reactivity, the levels of which mirror in vitro binding af®nities for DNase-immunity protein complexes (Wallis et al., 1995b). Homologue scanning and

Interface of the E9 DNase Domain-Im9 Complex

site-directed mutagenesis experiments have shown that three residues from helix II of Im9 de®ne colicin E9 DNase speci®city with a single residue (Leu33) playing the major role (Li et al., 1997, 1998). However, E9 DNase binding free energy is dominated by neighbouring residues from helix III, which are conserved in the immunity protein family (Wallis et al., 1998). We have interpreted these data in terms of a ``dual recognition'' mechanism in which the conserved sequences of Im9 are largely responsible for the stability of the complex while variable residues from helix II de®ne speci®city through neutral, negative or positive contributions toward the overall binding free energy (Wallis et al., 1998; Li et al., 1998). We have reported the crystal structure for the Ê E9 DNase-Im9 complex at 2.05 A resolution (Kleanthous et al., 1999). The E9 DNase is an a/b protein with a central core of b-sheet surrounded by a-helices. The C-terminal 32 amino acid residues of the enzyme show sequence identity to the H-N-H family of homing endonucleases. Generally encoded in self-splicing introns or inteins and found throughout the animal kingdom, these enzymes promote the homing of mobile genetic elements into intronless or inteinless alleles (Belfort & Roberts, 1997). The motif resembles a distorted zinc ®nger, binding zinc ions with nanomolar binding af®nity (Pommer et al., 1999), and forms the core of the E9 DNase active site. This is supported by random mutagenesis experiments (Garinot-Schneider et al., 1996) and by structural superpositions of the motif with the active sites È of other endonucleases (Kuhlmann et al., 1999b). Bound within the H-N-H motif was a single nickel ion coordinated by three histidine side-chains and a phosphate molecule. A surprise feature of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex structure was that the immunity protein does not bind in the active site of the enzyme. Instead, inactivation of DNase activity seems to result from steric and electrostatic hindrance of substrate binding, with Im9 positioned in the putative path of chromosomal DNA bound in the active-site cleft (Kleanthous et al., 1999). The molecular details of the E9 DNase-Im9 interface and how they relate to kinetic and thermodynamic data already published for the complex have yet to be addressed. In order to provide higher-resolution data with which to analyse this protein-protein interaction, we have now solved the structure for the complex Ê at 1.7 A. Details of the interface of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex are presented for the ®rst time, with particular emphasis on the role of interfacial water molecules. We present the ®rst comparative analysis of two colicin DNase-immunity protein complexes, by drawing on the results of Ko et al. (1999) and their structure of the colicin E7 DNase in complex with Im7. These data are discussed in the context of the dual recognition mechanism and other protein-protein interactions.

The root-meansquare (rms) deviation of a superposition of the Ê Ê Ê complex at 1.7 A with that solved at 2.05 A is 1 A for all atoms, indicating the absence of signi®cant conformational changes even though the original structure involved unfolding and refolding of the enzyme prior to complex formation (Figure 1(a)). The major differences between the two structures are localised to the active-site region of the E9 DNase and speci®cally the metal-ligation state. Ê Unlike the earlier structure, the complex at 1.7 A does not contain a divalent cation within the H-NH motif, con®rmed by metal analysis of the crystals (data not shown), and instead a water molecule occupies the site. A phosphate molecule is located in the same place in the two structures (Figure 1(b)). The structural rearrangements that result from the loss of the metal ion are minimal and in the immediate vicinity of the H-N-H motif,

Results and Discussion
Comparison of E9 DNase-Im9 complex crystal structures Ê In our original 2.05 A crystal structure of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex, the proteins were expressed and puri®ed separately and then combined to form a complex, enabling individual selenomethionylÈ labelled subunits to be prepared (Kuhlmann et al., 1999a; Kleanthous et al., 1999). Since nickel af®nity chromatography was used to purify the E9 DNase, and the equilibrium dissociation constant for nickel is 0.7 mM (Pommer et al., 1999), this explained the presence of Ni2 in the H-N-H motif of the enzyme. In the present work, the E9 DNase was expressed in tandem with Im9, and the complex puri®ed as described by Wallis et al. (1994), avoiding the use of nickel af®nity chromatography and the unfolding/refolding steps normally required to

Conformational heterogeneity in the E9 DNase Through previous NMR experiments we have found that the E9 DNase domain exhibits conformational heterogeneity in solution (Whittaker et al., 1998), which persists in the complex with Im9 (Whittaker et al., 2000). Speci®cally, chemical exchange cross-peaks in heteronuclear NMR experiments identi®ed two regions, centred around residues 20-25 and 65-72 (numbering according to the isolated 134 amino acid residue domain, as referred to by Kleanthous et al., 1999), that exist in two distinct conformational states and which interconvert on similar time-scales. The two regions that exhibit this conformational heterogeneity are helical and close together in three-dimensional space. Although not a major part of the Im9-binding site, residues 65-72 partially overlap the site, with residue 72 becoming buried in the complex. A single main-chain trace is observed in these regions in the current crystal structure of the E9 DNaseIm9 complex (the data for which were collected at 100 K), but with temperature factors slightly higher Ê than the rest of the complex (24.1(Æ1.59) A2 Ê 2 for residues 65-72). Interestcompared to 28 A ingly, it is in one of these conformationally heterogeneous regions (the 20s region) that our structure differs from the E7 DNase-Im7 complex reported by Ko et al. (1999), in which it is traced as a loop. However, the resolution of the E7 structure was Ê Ê 2.3 A compared to the present structure of 1.7 A, and the temperature factors were signi®cantly Ê higher in this region (>50 A2). General features of the E9 DNase-Im9 interface The immunity binding site on the DNase domain comprises a cleft formed by a short helix, an extended strand and two loops spanning residues 72-98. The cleft is adjacent to the enzyme active site, located at the extreme C terminus of the protein (Figure 1). Interestingly, this contiguous stretch of 27 amino acid residues is the most variable region of the endonuclease domain containing only ®ve conserved residues, none of which makes direct contact with Im9 (Kleanthous et al., 1999). The DNase binding site on the immunity protein spans residues 23-56 and is centred on helices II and III, with each helix straddling the cleft on the DNase. Other immunity protein regions that make additional contacts are the C-terminal end of helix I, and Asp62 from the loop that connects helices III and IV. The surface area buried in the interface between E9 DNase and Im9 in the complex is Ê 1575 A2, which is similar to that buried in the complex of the RNase barnase with its inhibitor barstar (Guillet et al., 1993; Buckle et al., 1994) and represents the average buried surface for a protein-

protein complex (Lo Conte et al., 1999). Figure 2 shows the differences in solvent-accessible surface area (ÁASA) for each residue in the complex. Protein-protein interfaces often display electrostatic complementarity (McCoy et al., 1997), and calculation of the electrostatic potentials highlights such complementarity for the E9 DNase-Im9 complex. The Im9-binding site on the DNase domain is strongly positively charged whereas the DNasebinding site on the immunity protein has a net negative charge (Figure 3). Their respective charge states are consistent with the electrostatic steering mechanism involved in the diffusion-controlled association of the E9 DNase with Im9, deduced from both the magnitude of the bimolecular association rate constant for the complex ($109 MÀ1 sÀ1 in buffers of low ionic strength) and its strong saltdependence (Wallis et al., 1995a). Electrostatics play an important role in accelerating macromolecular associations (Berg & von Hippel, 1985; Pontius, 1993; Honig & Nicholls, 1995), and this has been analysed in some detail by Schreiber & Fersht (1996) for the protein-protein interaction between the positively charged barnase and its

negatively charged inhibitor barstar. In the absence of electrostatic forces the basal association rate constant for the barnase-barstar complex was $105 MÀ1 sÀ1 which increased to over 109 MÀ1 sÀ1 when long-range electrostatic forces were included. Considering the role of immunity proteins in preventing bacterial suicide and the high degree of sequence identity within the DNase and immunity protein families, it seems likely that similar diffusion-limited, bimolecular associations will be observed for the other colicin DNase-immunity protein complexes. Protein-protein complexes tend to show a high degree of shape complementarity at their interfaces (Jones & Thornton, 1996); however, this has little bearing on complex af®nity. For example, the complexes formed between the ribonucleases RNase A and barnase with their respective inhibitors, ribonuclease inhibitor and barstar, both have equilibrium dissociation constants of 10À14 M (Lee et al., 1989; Schreiber & Fersht, 1993), yet the shape complementarity of the barnase-barstar complex is signi®cantly greater than that of the RNase A-ribonuclease inhibitor complex, while the total surface area buried is greater (by >30 % ) for the latter

(Buckle et al., 1994; Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996). Shape complementarity can be calculated using a shape correlation index (Sc) based on distance and angle of the normal vectors to the molecular surface (Lawrence & Colman, 1993). Interfaces with Sc  1 are perfectly complementary to each other, while interfaces with Sc around 0 have no correlation in their topography. For protein oligomers and proteinase-protein inhibitor interfaces, Sc ranges from 0.70 to 0.76, whereas antibody-antigen interfaces have poorer shape complementarity, with Sc between 0.64 and 0.68 (Lawrence & Colman, 1993). The values of Sc for the barnasebarstar and RNase A-ribonuclease inhibitor complexes are 0.70 and 0.58, respectively (Buckle et al., 1994, Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996). For the E9 DNase-Im9 complex, Sc  0.72, indicating a high degree of shape complementarity at the interface comparable to that of the barnase-barstar complex. Water molecules make a signi®cant contribution to interface complementarity in the barnase-barstar complex, increasing Sc from 0.70 to 0.82 (Buckle et al., 1994). Similarly, the ®ve buried water molecules at the interface of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex (see Figure 4(b)) serve to enhance shape

complementarity, since they increase the value of Sc to 0.78 when included in the calculation. Interfacial contacts and hydrogen bonding in the E9 DNase-Im9 complex Thirty-one residues (14 from the E9 DNase and 17 from Im9) are in contact across the interface. In the centre of the binding site is an aromatic stacking interaction between Phe86 of the E9 DNase domain and Tyr54 of the immunity protein (Figure 4). The Phe86-Tyr54 interaction is lined by hydrophobic residues, including Leu33, Val34, Val37, Ile53 and the aromatic ring of Tyr55 of the immunity protein, as well as the alkyl side-chains of Lys89, Lys97 and Val98 of the DNase domain. Surrounding this hydrophobic pocket are 12 hydrogen bonds (Table 2 and Figure 4(a)), two being salt-bridges and three of which involve one charged partner. The two salt-links are formed between basic residues from the E9 DNase, Arg54 and Lys97, and acidic residues from the N and C-

terminal ends of helix II from Im9, Glu30 and Glu41, respectively. Both salt-links likely contribute to the overall binding free energy, since alanine mutants of Glu30 and Glu41 of Im9 destabilise the complex by 1.4 kcal molÀ1 and 2.1 kcal molÀ1,

1169 these backbone-contacting residues, since alanine mutations have signi®cant effects on DNase binding free energy (and in most cases negligible effects on the conformational stability of the immunity protein itself). For example, binding free energy decreased by 5.9 kcal molÀ1 when Asp51 was substituted for alanine, the largest ÁÁGbinding of all Im9 interfacial residues, suggesting a pivotal role in stabilising the complex (Wallis et al., 1998). From the crystal structure, it is clear that Asp51 is involved in a network of interactions, including a main-chain hydrogen bond to residue 89, as well as coordinating two water molecules, W4 and W144 (Figure 4). The roles of the two immunity protein tyrosine residues (Tyr54 and Tyr55) at the interface have also been probed by mutagenesis. On substitution for alanine, Tyr54, which stacks against Phe86 of the DNase, has a signi®cant effect on DNase binding free energy (ÁÁGbinding  4.8 kcal molÀ1), although this may be due, in part, to structural changes induced by the mutation, since the conformational stability of the Tyr54Ala mutant decreased by 2.9 kcal molÀ1 (Wallis et al., 1998). Tyr55 seems to serve two roles; its hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Phe86, while the phenyl ring slots into a gap created by the immunity-binding cleft and caps the hydrophobic pocket containing Phe86. Of its two roles, the capping function of Tyr55 seems to be the most important to the stability of the complex, since a Tyr55Phe substitution perturbs binding by <0.5 kcal molÀ1 (C. Taylor, A. Keeble, W. Li & C.K., unpublished results), whereas a Tyr55Ala mutation diminishes binding by 4.6 kcal molÀ1 (Wallis et al., 1998). Since the phenyl ring makes no van der Waals contact with neighbouring residues (and the alanine substitution does not affect the conformational stability of Im9 itself), we interpret this loss of binding free energy as most likely due to the unfavourable exposure of the hydrophobic cavity containing Phe86 to bulk solvent. The remaining hydrogen bonds involve sidechains of each protein and include, Im9 Ser50 with DNase Gln92 and Im9 Asp62 with DNase Asn72 (Figure 4(a)). Of these, only Ser50 is conserved (this residue is threonine in Im7 but serine in the other immunity proteins). Ser50 of Im9 has been mutated to alanine, resulting in ÁÁGbinding of 2.1 kcal molÀ1, indicating signi®cant contribution to binding free energy. Asp62 of Im9 is the only Im9 residue involved in hydrogen bonding interactions yet to be mutated. No interfacial alanine mutant has been reported for the E9 DNase. The role of water in the E9 DNase-Im9 complex Water is important in enhancing the stability of protein-protein interactions by ®lling in cavities, which increases the packing density at the interface, and by mediating intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Covell & Wallqvist, 1997). The water molecules buried at the E9 DNase-Im9 interface

respectively (Wallis et al., 1998). Sequence comparisons show that Im9 Glu30 and E9 DNase Arg54 are both conserved in their respective families, suggesting that this salt-bridge should be present in all the DNase-immunity protein complexes. However, this interaction does not occur in the E7 DNase-Im7 complex, where instead the equivalent immunity protein residue (Asp31; Im7 is larger than Im9 by one residue) interacts with DNase speci®city residues (see later and Figure 11). The salt-bridge between Glu41 of Im9 with Lys97 of the E9 DNase is clearly a speci®city contact in this complex, since neither residue is conserved, and this con®rms the results of earlier mutagenesis work by Curtis & James (1991), where Lys97 (identi®ed as Lys545 in the full-length colicin) was identi®ed as a potential speci®city-determining residue. The frequency of hydrogen bonding in colicin DNase-immunity protein complexes is higher than that normally seen in protein-protein interactions. Comparative studies of structurally de®ned protein-protein complexes by Jones & Thornton (1996), using a database of 27 heteromeric structures, and Lo Conte et al. (1999), using a dataset of 36 structures, found that such complexes generally show a Ê frequency of one hydrogen bond per 170 A2 of buried surface. By contrast, the frequency of hydrogen bonds in the E9 DNase-Im9 complex is one per Ê 131 A2, which is similar to that of the barnase-barstar complex and re¯ects the fact that the two proteins are highly complementary in terms of their polarity. Indeed, this high frequency of hydrogen bonding is more often associated with proteinDNA interactions, which are generally more polar than protein-protein interactions (Nadassy et al., 1999). In the E7 DNase-Im7 complex, the frequency Ê is even higher, with one hydrogen bond per 92 A2 (Ko et al., 1999). The difference in hydrogen bonding frequency between the E7 and E9 complexes is a consequence of the different interactions used by each to achieve speci®city (see below). Six of the 12 hydrogen bonds at the E9 DNaseIm9 interface involve side-chain to main-chain interactions (Figure 4(a) and Table 2). None of the three DNase side-chains (Asn72, Ser77 and Tyr83) engaged in such contacts is conserved, consistent with their involvement in speci®city. This has already been inferred for Ser77 and Tyr83 (identi®ed in the full-length colicin as Ser525 and Tyr531) from site-directed mutagenesis experiments by Curtis & James (1991). In contrast, the three Im9 residues (Glu30, Asp51 and Tyr55) that contact backbone atoms are all conserved residues. Such conserved, sequence-independent contacts in a protein-protein interaction are reminiscent of the conserved anchoring interactions made toward the termini of a peptide bound in the canyon of the class I major histocompatibility complex (reviewed by Batalia & Collins, 1997), suggesting that they are likely to be important in maintaining the stability of colicin DNase-immunity protein complexes. This role is con®rmed by mutational analysis of

1170 accomplish both roles. As indicated above, they increase the shape complementarity of the interface by ®lling in gaps between imperfectly packed regions, but they also mediate a large number of inter-protein hydrogen bonds. A total of 14 hydrogen bonds involving ®ve buried water molecules are formed at the interface (Figure 4(b)). Remarkably, the majority of these (W2, W4, W7 and W144) are almost exclusively co-ordinated by main-chain atoms and/or conserved amino acids, implying that these contacts are important for the stability of the complex in much the same way as the direct hydrogen bonds between conserved Im9 residues and the DNase backbone. The remaining water molecule (W23) is the only one whose hydrogen bonding network includes a non-conserved amino acid (Tyr99). The interfacial water molecules have relatively low temperature factors and are generally as well ordered as protein side-chains at the interface (Table 3). Two of the water molecules (W4 and W7) are completely buried and are part of an interconnecting network of main-chain to side-chain hydrogen bonds (Figure 4(b)). Water 4, which has the lowest B-value of all the solvent molecules, is hydrogen bonded to the side-chain and main-chain amide nitrogen atom of Asp51 from Im9, a conserved amino acid, and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr87 from the E9 DNase. Asp51, in turn, hydrogen bonds W144, which is also hydrogenbonded to the backbone and amide nitrogen atoms of Asn90 of the E9 DNase. W7 is coordinated by two main-chain oxygen atoms (of residues 22 and 74 from Im9 and the E9 DNase, respectively) as well as the hydroxyl group of Tyr54. Although none of the ®ve conserved E9 DNase residues in the Im9 binding site contacts the immunity protein directly, a conserved asparagine residue (Asn75) from the DNase is involved in co-ordinating a buried water molecule (W2), which in turn hydrogen bonds the backbone of both Im9 (carbonyl group of Tyr54) and the DNase (amide nitrogen atom of Asn72).

Interface of the E9 DNase Domain-Im9 Complex

NMR, binding energy hotspots and the E9 DNase-Im9 interface The E9 DNase binding site on the Im9 protein was ®rst identi®ed by Osborne et al. (1997) through 1 H-15N HSQC spectra in which 15N-labelled Im9 was bound to unlabelled DNase (Figure 5). The majority of the amide perturbations that were identi®ed mapped onto helices II and III, showing that this approach provided a reasonably robust assignment of the binding site. The resulting alanine scan of DNase-binding residues on Im9 (Wallis et al., 1998) demonstrated that around twothirds of the binding free energy emanates from four conserved residues in helix III (Ser50, Asp51, Tyr54 and Tyr55), with the remainder coming from speci®city-determining residues in the neighbouring helix II (such as Leu33 and Val34 and Glu41; Figure 5). Over 30 mutations were made in the alanine scan, encompassing DNase-contacting and non-contacting residues. This was because the precise location of the binding site was unknown at the time and the NMR perturbation method could have produced perturbations in residues that lie outside of the binding region (Spitzfaden et al., 1992; Osborne et al., 1997). With the identi®cation of the binding site from the crystal structure, it is now clear that, in most cases, alanine mutations of residues outside of the E9 DNase-binding site produce little or no effect on binding (residues labelled green and blue in Figure 5), again consistent with our original assignment of the binding site (Wallis et al., 1998). Binding energy hotspots are often observed in protein-protein complexes (Hawkins et al., 1993; Clackson & Wells, 1995; Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). These are clusters of a small number of residues at the interface that tend to dominate binding free energy. In the complex between growth hormone with its receptor, for example, binding free energy is dominated by hydrophobic interactions from two tryptophan residues in the centre of the binding site (Clackson & Wells, 1995). This ``functional

epitope'' is surrounded by less important contact residues that are hydrophilic in nature and more hydrated. The E9 DNase-Im9 complex also has a hotspot, focused around the conserved residues of helix III (Figure 5), and indeed the same hotspot is observed in a non-cognate complex of the E9 DNase with Im2, even though Im2 binds the E9 DNase six orders of magnitude more weakly than Im9. The reason Im9 binds the E9 DNase with such high af®nity relative to Im2 is the additional stability gained from having the appropriate residues in helix II, which in Im2 either destabilise the complex or do not contribute to the overall binding free energy (Li et al., 1998). In essence, this is the dual recognition mechanism. It begins to explain how the equilibrium dissociation constants for colicin DNase-immunity protein complexes can span more than ten orders of magnitude through the modulation of a conserved binding energy hotspot by a small number of speci®city-determining residues (Wallis et al., 1998). It also provides a framework for understanding how novel immunity protein speci®cities evolve, through the mutation and selection of a limited number of amino acids at the interface without the need for whole-sale change of the binding epitope. This mechanism has similarities to that by which the 2C T-cell receptor

recognises class I MHC molecules bound with antigenic peptides. Manning et al. (1998) reported an alanine scan across the binding loops of the T-cell receptor that showed a distribution of binding free energies similar to that of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex, wherein two-thirds was towards the conserved helical jaws of the MHC molecule and the remainder directed toward the speci®city-determining peptide. Bogan & Thorn (1998) have compiled a database of alanine scanning results and used the data to further explore the basis for the binding energy hotspot in protein-protein interactions. One striking correlation they made was that substitution of an interface residue with alanine was more likely to have a large effect on the binding free energy if the side-chain for that residue was completely inaccessible to bulk solvent in the complex, and this was more likely to happen for residues at the centre of an interface. In contrast, residues with a high degree of solvent-accessibility in the complex tended not to affect ÁÁGbinding signi®cantly. It was proposed that peripheral residues might form an O-ring, thereby excluding bulk solvent from binding energy hotspot residues. We have compared our published alanine scanning data (Wallis et al., 1998) and solvent-accessibility of mutated side-

Figure 6. Correlation between solvent-accessibility of interface residues in a protein-protein complex and the change in binding free energy that results from substitution of that residue for alanine. The alanine scanning data for Im9 binding the E9 DNase (Wallis et al., 1998), ®lled symbols, have been combined with data collated by Bogan & Thorn (1998), open symbols, on a variety of protein-protein complexes. Asp51, Tyr54 and Tyr55 of Im9 form a binding energy hotspot when bound to the E9 DNase, while Leu33 and Val34 are speci®city residues. The Figure highlights the general trend that residues showing the lowest accessibility to bulk solvent tend to contribute most to binding energy, but also identi®es Tyr55 from Im9 as an exception to this trend. Further details are given in the text.

chains (the present work) with that compiled by Bogan & Thorn (1998) for other alanine scanning studies (available at http://motorhead.ucsf.edu/ $thorn/hotspot) and the data presented in Figure 6. Interfacial Im9 alanine mutants follow the same general trend as other studies, with the greatest effects on ÁÁGbinding coming from residues that are least accessible to bulk solvent in the complex. However, Tyr55 is a notable exception to this trend. A Tyr55Ala mutation has a large effect on DNase binding energy yet a signi®cant proportion of the tyrosine side-chain is in contact with bulk solvent. This observation highlights the fact that the E9 DNase binding hotspot on Im9 is not in the centre of the protein-protein interaction surface but displaced to one side, with Tyr55 one of the outermost residues. As described earlier, the most important role of Tyr55 seems to be its capping function, excluding bulk solvent from the hydrophobic core of the interface. This would constitute an O-ring residue using the same nomenclature as Bogan & Thorn (1998) but in this instance one that also forms part of the binding energy hotspot. Comparison of two DNase-immunity protein complexes highlights conserved, watermediated hydrogen bonds and the structural basis for dual recognition Ê We now compare the 2.3 A crystal structure of Im7 bound to its cognate DNase, reported by Ko Ê et al. (1999), with the present 1.7 A crystal structure for the E9 DNase-Im9 complex. Main-chain atom

superpositions of the two DNases and the two Ê immunity proteins have rms deviations of 1.8 A Ê , respectively. Previous structural comand 3.1 A parisons of the two unbound immunity proteins Ê showed rms deviations of 4 A, which reduced to Ê 1.7 A when the loops and termini were excluded from the calculation (Dennis et al., 1998). When the structural superposition is repeated for the intact complexes, it becomes clear that the immunity proteins are displaced relative to each other (Figure 7). The reason for this displacement is a 19  rigidbody rotation, the axis of which is formed by the two hotspot tyrosine residues from helix III of the immunity proteins, Tyr54 and Tyr55 in Im9. Since they are the pivots through which the rotation occurs, their orientations are not altered signi®cantly in the two complexes and indeed the interactions that each pair makes are nearly identical. The same is true of other residues in helix III, such as Asp51 from Im9 (Asp52 in Im7) and its watermediated hydrogen bonding network. Residues further away from this axis are affected, however, in particular residues in helix II. The rotation has the effect of presenting different regions of helix II (the speci®city helix) to the DNase (Figure 8). Hence, in the E7 DNase-Im7 complex, speci®city contacts are achieved using the N-terminal end of helix II from Im7, whereas the entire helix is used by Im9 in its complex with the E9 DNase. Notwithstanding the different orientations of the two immunity proteins, the amount of buried surface in the E7 DNase-Im7 complex is similar to that of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex (1473 compared

Figure 7. A 19  rigid-body rotation relates the positions of Im7 and Im9 in their respective complexes with colicin DNases. The left-hand panel shows a superposition of the two complexes based on a structural alignment of the DNase domains (which show a higher degree of structural and sequence identity than the immunity proteins). The E7 DNase has been removed for clarity. Although the conserved protein tyrosine residues from helix III occupy similar positions in the two complexes, the immunity proteins themselves do not overlay well. Using the program DynDom (Hayward, 1999), a rotation axis was found (®lled bar) that passes through the conserved tyrosine residues of helix III and relates the positions of the immunity proteins in their respective complexes (right-hand panel). A 19  degree rotation of the Im7 protein in the left-hand complex about this axis, to form the right-hand ®gure, overlays the immunity proteins with minimal changes to the position of the conserved tyrosine residues.

Water molecules are represented by spheres, black for the E9 complex and grey for the E7 complex. The numbering scheme relates to the E9 DNase complex (see Figure 4(b)). Only three water molecules (W2, W4 and W144) are located in the same positions in the two complexes.

Ê to 1575 A2). Comparison of buried water molecules underscores their similarity (Figure 9). Seven water molecules are buried in the E7 DNase-Im7 complex, compared to ®ve in the E9 complex and this highlights the fact that the E7 complex is more polar than that of E9. Importantly, three of these are conserved (equivalent to W2, W4 and W144 in the E9 DNase-Im9 complex), which correspond to the water molecules that mediate most of the conserved side-chain hydrogen bonds from helix III to the backbone of the DNase (Figure 10). The remaining four water molecules in the E7 DNaseIm7 complex likely mediate speci®city contacts, since they have no clear counterparts in the E9 DNase-Im9 complex (Figure 9). It seems therefore that the water structure in colicin DNase-immunity protein complexes mirrors side-chain architecture at the interface, with both conserved and variable water molecules playing a role in the stability and speci®city of the complex, respectively. The distinctive role of buried water in the stability and speci®city of protein-protein complexes has recently been highlighted by Janin (1999). When speci®city residues in Im9, such as Val34, are substituted for alanine the loss in binding free energy (2.6 kcal molÀ1) is similar to that seen in protein stability studies when buried methylene groups are deleted from the hydrophobic cores of proteins. On this basis, Wallis et al. (1998) made two predictions about the E9 DNase-Im9 interface,

in particular about how speci®city residues in helix II might modulate binding interactions from helix III. Firstly, the interface was likely to be as tightly packed as the hydrophobic core of a folded protein. The present crystal structure for the complex shows that this is indeed the case, with Val34 and Leu33 forming the hydrophobic pocket receiving Phe86 of the DNase (Figure 11). Secondly, given the identity of speci®city residues in helix II of other immunity proteins, it was likely that part of the modulation of conserved interactions might be through the insertion of unpartnered charged or hydrophilic amino acids into hydrophobic binding pockets on the E9 DNase, hence destabilising the complex. Comparing the two DNase-immunity protein complexes reinforces this assertion, since all the speci®city contacts in the E7 DNase-Im7 protein are through charged hydrogen bonds, whereas the equivalent positions in the E9 DNaseIm9 complex are occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (Figure 11). The structural details of these contacts, as well as the rotation function that relates the immunity proteins in their complexes, begins to explain why the Im7 protein can bind and inactivate the E9 DNase but with an af®nity that is ten orders of magnitude weaker than Im9 (Wallis et al., 1995b). As detailed above, the DNase-binding surface of an immunity protein is constructed primarily from a conserved helix that confers stability and a vari-

able helix that de®nes speci®city. A consequence of this evolutionary design is that a boundary must exist between conserved and variable amino acids. Inspection of the two DNase-immunity protein complexes highlights the position of this boundary as Im9 Tyr54 from helix III (Figure 11). Although conserved, this tyrosine residue contacts a variable amino acid side-chain on the DNase surface, phenylalanine in the E9 DNase (and in colicin E2) but lysine and arginine in the E7 and E8 DNases, respectively. Tyr54 is able to interact with these non-conserved amino acids on the DNase by virtue of their long, hydrophobic alkyl or aromatic sidechains, with which it forms van der Waals interactions. The interaction, essentially conservative in nature, guides the variable amino acid of the DNase toward the speci®city amino acids of the immunity protein, Leu33 and Val34 in the E9 DNase, Asp31 and Asp35 in the E7 DNase. These interactions are further augmented by additional speci®city residues of the DNases that are of the same chemical character (Figure 11). The end result is a compact, highly co-operative set of interactions

that interweave conserved and variable amino acids at the interface, and it is this inter-digitation that likely explains both the high af®nity of these complexes and their exquisite speci®city. In conclusion, immunity proteins are a family of DNase inhibitors conserved in both sequence and structure that bind and inactivate endonuclease colicins with af®nities that differ by ten orders of magnitude. The present work provides a structural framework for understanding the dual recognition mechanism that underpins this behaviour. The af®nity of immunity proteins is derived largely from a

1176 conserved binding energy hotspot from helix III, composed primarily of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that anchor the immunity protein to the DNase surface. The focal point of the interface is the conserved hydrophobic contact between a single tyrosine residue from helix III (Im9 Tyr54) and a bulky, variable amino acid residue of the DNase that is sequestered from bulk solvent by a neighbouring tyrosine residue (Im9 Tyr55). This hydrophobic interaction serves to present the amino acid from the DNase to the speci®city sites of the immunity protein, and is surrounded by hydrogen bonds, many of which emanate from a conserved aspartic acid residue (Im9 Asp51), and contact the DNase backbone either directly or indirectly via water. Three backbone-contacting interfacial water molecules are conserved in DNase colicin-immunity protein complexes, which signi®cantly expands the number of stabilising hydrogen bonds at the interface. Variable residues from helix II of the immunity protein serve to in¯uence binding, and so de®ne speci®city, through neutral, negative or positive contributions to the overall binding free energy for the complex and take the form of hydrophobic contacts (in the E9 system) or charged hydrogen bonds (in the E7 system) in cognate complexes. Hence, modulation of the conserved binding energy hotspot in non-cognate complexes is likely to be through the insertion of charged or polar groups into non-polar environments and vice versa. As well as accounting for both the stability and speci®city of DNase-immunity protein complexes, dual recognition may underpin speci®city in other protein-protein interactions, since it describes the thermodynamic interplay between conserved and variable sequences that are often buried together at the interfaces of protein-protein complexes.

Materials and Methods
Data collection was performed at Daresbury station Ê 9.6 (l  0.87 A) at 100 K using a single cryoprotected crystal (15 % (v/v) ethyleneglycol). Since crystals of the E9 DNase are not perfectly isomorphous when frozen, cell parameters vary up to 2 % in the a and c edges and 1 % in the b edge, molecular replacement was carried out using the program AMoRe (Navaza & Saludjian, 1997). Ê The original 2.05 A structure for the E9 DNase-Im9 complex (accession code, 1bxi), but without the bound metal ion or phosphate molecule, was used as the starting Ê model. Using a resolution range of 15-3 A, a successful replacement was obtained corresponding to a correlation coef®cient of 80.5 % and an initial R-value of 0.31. As with the original structure, there was one molecule of complex in the asymmetric unit. The structure was subÈ sequently re®ned using the CNS program (Brunger et al., 1998) and statistics for the ®nal structure listed in Table 1. The structure was analysed on a graphics workstation using program packages O (Jones et al., 1991), INSIGHT (Biosym) and SPOCK (Christopher, 1997). Interactions were analysed with the program CONTACT from the CCP4 program package (CCP4, 1994). Surface-accessible areas were calculated with the programs AEREAMOL,
