Abstract The effect of D≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bonding on the reduction potential of rubredoxin was investigated by the introduction of an O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bond on the surface of Pyrococcus abyssi rubredoxin. The formation of a weak hydrogen bond between Ser44-Oc and Cys42-Sc in mutant W4L/R5S/A44S increased the reduction potential by 56 mV. When side effects of the mutation were taken into account, the contribution of the additional cluster hydrogen bond to the reduction potential was estimated to be +65 mV. The structural analysis was based on ultrahigh-resolution structures of oxidized P. abyssi rubredoxin W4L/R5S and W4L/R5S/A44S refined to 0.69 ∞ and 0.86 A, respectively. Keywords Pyrococcus abyssi ¡ Rubredoxin ¡ Reduction potential ¡ Ultrahigh-resolution X-ray crystallography

Introduction The reduction potentials of electron transfer proteins are optimized for highly specific and efficient electron transfer [1]. The mechanisms by which the reduction potential is defined by the protein structure are still not completely understood. In iron≠sulfur proteins which show midpoint potentials in the range ¿700 to +400 mV [2] the potential is set by the type of iron≠sulfur cluster and the structure of the cluster-binding site. The fine-tuning of the electron affinity in homologous iron≠sulfur proteins with highly conserved active sites is achieved by minor structural modifications in the direct environment of the prosthetic group. The reduction potential is modified by electrostatic effects from charged and polar groups, by hydrogen bonding to sulfur atoms of the cluster, by the solvent accessibility of the active site and by the volume of cavities hosting the iron≠sulfur cluster [3≠7]. The importance of N≠H¡¡¡S≠Fe and O≠H¡¡¡S≠Fe hydrogen bonds as a major determinant of the reduction potential has been proven by numerous studies on iron≠sulfur proteins and model compounds [7≠11]. Though computational methods are available for the analysis of the electronic structure in electron transfer proteins and the prediction of reduction potentials [12≠16], site-directed mutagenesis and high-resolution X-ray crystallography are indispensable tools for the acquisition of experimental data. Application of this approach to the study of hydrogen bonding in iron≠sulfur proteins is unfortunately limited by the fact that most of the hydrogen bonds towards iron≠sulfur clusters are N≠H¡¡¡S≠Fe hydrogen bonds deriving from peptide nitrogen atoms which cannot be removed without significant distortion of the protein structure. The effect of hydrogen bonding on the reduction potential in rubredoxins has been studied by

site-directed mutagenesis experiments which modified the strength but not the number of hydrogen bonds towards the [Fe(SCys)4] site, mainly through changes in the amino acid side chain volumes at positions 8 and 44 [9, 17]. Using a different approach, we modified the reduction potential of Pyrococcus abyssi rubredoxin (PaRd) W4L/R5S by increasing the number of hydrogen bonds towards the [Fe(SCys)4] site through the introduction of an O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠ Fe hydrogen bond on the surface of the molecule. The conserved Tyr≠OH¡¡¡Sc≠Fe1 hydrogen bond in highpotential Rieske proteins [18] was used as a template to design an A44S mutant with a hydrogen bond between Ser44-Oc and ligand atom Cys42-Sc (Fig. 1). This article describes the effect of this mutation on the reduction potential and the protein structure. The analysis is based on an ultrahigh-resolution structure of oxidized PaRd W4L/ ∞ ∞ R5S/A44S refined to 0.86-A resolution and a 0.69-A reference structure of PaRd W4L/R5S published recently [19].

The reaction mixture contained the buffer supplied with enzyme, 6 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM dNTP-mix, 2 lM of each primer and 20 U Pwo polymerase in a volume of 300 lL. A two-stage temperature program was used: stage 1 was 2 min at 95 ∞C followed by five cycles of 30 s at 95 ∞C, 15 s at 60 ∞C, 20 s at 45 ∞C, ramping up to 72 ∞C with 1.2 ∞C s¿1 and finally 20 s at 72 ∞C; stage 2 was 25 cycles of 25 s at 95 ∞C and 40 s at 77 ∞C. The products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, digested with BamHI and NcoI and ligated into the pet15b plasmid (Novagen) as previously described [18]. The ligated plasmid was transformed into competent BL21-Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene). Colonies were tested for the expression of the rubredoxin gene as described by Schmidt et al. [20]. The plasmids from four positive clones were isolated and sequenced.

Materials and methods Construction of the expression plasmid for the W4L/R5S/A44S mutant The gene encoding the W4L/R5S/A44S mutant of the PaRd was synthesized from two oligonucleotides (Rm2_CT_A44S: AGTGGATCCTTATTCAATGCGTTC AAATTCGCTTTTCGGGCTGCCACACAGCGGACACA CCCAGTCATCCGGCAGATCTTCAAATTTGGTACCC GGGC; Rm2_NT: TACCGTCCATGGCGAAATTGAGTT

Large-scale expression and purification of the rubredoxins The large-scale production and purification of the rubre® doxin mutant was performed as described by Bonisch et al. [19].

Electrochemical techniques The reduction potential of PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S was determined in 25 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris≠HCl) pH 7.5 by cyclic voltammetry experiments as previously described [19].

Protein crystallization Crystals of PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S were grown in 3.7≠4.0 M sodium malonate pH 6.0 with the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method at 20 ∞C. The concentration of the protein stock solution was 30 mg mL¿1 in 25 mM Tris≠HCl pH 7.5.

Data collection A single crystal of PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S was used to collect a complete dataset at EMBL beamline BW7B (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) using a 345-mm Marresearch image plate detector. With sodium malonate working as a cryoprotectant the crystal was mounted directly for data collection at ¿173 ∞C. An ultrahigh-resolution dataset

consisting of 140 images (rotation range 140∞) with a ∞ resolution of 0.86 A was collected. The crystal diffracted to higher resolution, but data collection was limited to ∞ 0.86-A resolution by the beamline setup (wavelength ∞ 0.85 A, crystal-to-detector distance 100 mm). Then a highresolution and a medium-resolution dataset to 1.429- and ∞ 2.382-A resolution, respectively, were collected, each consisting of 60 frames with a rotation range of 120∞. The raw data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK [21]. Friedel pairs were kept separate in the output file using the ANOMALOUS flag. Data-collection statistics are given in Table 1.

Structure solution and refinement The structure of PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S was solved by direct methods employing SHELXD [22]. The atomic positions output by SHELXD were identified by comparison with the ∞ structure of PaRd W4L/R5S refined to 0.69-A resolution ∞ [19]. An isotropic temperature factor of 3 A2 corresponding to the Wilson B factor was assigned to all atoms. The refinement of the model was performed with SHELXL [23]. Each round of refinement consisted of ten cycles of conjugate-gradient least-squares refinement against the intensities of 66,723 reflections. The Friedel pairs were treated as independent reflections. For iron and sulfur atoms, corrections for anomalous dispersion (f 0 , f @) ∞ were input for a wavelength of 0.85 A. A total of 3,516 randomly chosen reflections (5%) were flagged as a reference set for cross-validation analysis [24]. The geometry of

the model was not restrained; only for disordered atoms were standard geometrical restraints introduced during the refinement. No antibump restraints were used for protein and solvent. A diffuse-solvent model [25] was used throughout. Water molecules automatically introduced by SHELXL were analyzed manually after each round of refinement. The occupancy of solvent molecules was not refined and the occupancy of partially occupied solvent sites was set to 0.5. Model building was performed within O [26]. After refinement of the initial model from SHELXD (Rfree 35.76%), 108 missing atoms and 51 solvent molecules were added (Rfree 20.46%). An additional 43 water molecules were included into the model and disorder of main-chain and side-chain atoms was modeled (Rfree 17.91%). Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms were introduced, resulting in a significant decrease of Rfree by 4.1% (Rfree 13.79%). Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters in the direction of covalent bonds were restrained by a rigid bond restraint. Riding protons were added to the model and refined with isotropic temperature factors set by default to 1.2 or 1.5 times the B factor of the bound atom (Rfree 11.20%). The orientation of ≠NH+, ≠CH3 and ≠OH groups 3 was refined if the protons were observable (SHELXL commands HFIX 137 and HFIX 147). A final round of conjugate-gradient least-squares refinement consisting of 20 cycles with adjusted weight was performed (Rfree 10.42%). Thereafter the refinement procedure was changed to full-matrix least-squares refinement using SHELXH. Owing to the small size of the molecule, it was not necessary to block the refinement, but the damping factors had to be increased in order to keep the refinement stable (Rfree 10.54%). In the final round the model was refined against all intensities. For the calculation of estimated standard uncertainties, one cycle of full-matrix least-squares refinement was performed without restraints, damping and application of shifts. The refinement statistics are given in Table 2. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, accession code 2PYA.

Results and discussion Protein crystallization, structure solution and refinement Protein crystals of mutant PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S were grown in sodium malonate pH 6.0 under similar conditions as described for PaRd W4L/R5S [19]. PaRd W4L/R5S/ A44S crystallized more easily than PaRd W4L/R5S and produced crystals of slightly better quality.

may affect the crystallization behavior. The crystal chosen for data collection belonged to space group P212121 with a unit cell that was unusually large for PaRd W4L/R5S and W4L/R5S/A44S crystals. The unit-cell parameters were ∞ 25.385, 39.812 and 45.117 A compared with 25.144, 39.449 ∞ for the PaRd W4L/R5S reference structure and 45.068 A [19], corresponding to an increase in unit-cell volume by 2% ∞ ∞ (45,596.5 A3 compared with 44,703.2 A3). For structure solution by direct methods and least-squares refinement, the same strategy was used as described for PaRd W4L/R5S [19] to facilitate comparative analysis. The precision of both structures was comparable as judged by the estimated standard uncertainties for atomic positions, bond lengths and bond angles of fully occupied main-chain atoms.

® structure of mutant PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S (H. Bonisch, unpublished results) resulted in a unit-cell volume and stereochemical parameters very close to those of the PaRd W4L/R5S reference structure. These results suggested that ∞ the deviations observed for the 0.86-A structure of PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S reflected the effects of crystal nonisomorphism and were not caused by the introduction of the additional cluster hydrogen bond. Radiation damage (partial reduction) could also be excluded on the basis of the analysis of data-processing statistics, decay R factor [28] and electron density maps.

Mutation A44S The A44S mutation introduced a side-chain hydroxyl group on the surface of PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S, which formed a weak hydrogen bond [29] to the Sc ligand atom of Cys42 (Figs. 1a, 3). The electron density for the hydrogen atom Ser44-Hc was clearly visible in a rAweighted residual electron density map before hydrogen atoms were modeled during SHELXL refinement (Fig. 3a). The orientation of the O≠H bond was refined against this experimental difference electron density with SHELXL ∞ command HFIX 147. The D¡¡¡A distance was 3.24 A, the ∞ and the D≠H¡¡¡A angle 158.7∞. D≠H¡¡¡A distance 2.44 A The mutation caused a distortion around residues 43 and 44 because Ser44-Oc was packed against the side chain of Ile8, fitting into a small groove formed by atoms Cb, Hb, Cc1, Hc1, Cc2 and Hc2 (Fig. 3b). The Cb and ∞ Ca atoms of Ser44 were displaced by 0.43 and 0.27 A, respectively, compared with Ala44 in PaRd W4L/R5S (Fig. 2a). At residue Ile8 packing against Ser44-Oc caused a slight rotation of the side chain and suppressed the formation of an alternative side-chain conformation that was observed in PaRd W4L/R5S [19].

the disordered N- and C-terminal residues Ala2 and Glu53, the flexible turn Pro34-Trp37 and the site of the point mutation Gly43-Ser44. The positions and orientations of side chains were also well conserved, with ∞ differences between atomic positions below 0.1 A for most atoms. The main-chain B factors for both mutants were very similar (Fig. 2c) and did not provide any hint for a significant change of molecule flexibility in the crystal. The superimposition of the structures showed that the model of PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S was slightly larger than that of PaRd W4L/R5S. The molecule volume calculated ∞ with VOIDOO [27] was 36 A3 (0.65%) larger than that for PaRd W4L/R5S, which corresponded to an increase of the ∞ average molecule diameter of 0.04 A. Accordingly, increased bond lengths for covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds were observed (see later). The preliminary refinement of a second independent ultrahigh-resolution

Geometry of the [Fe(SCys)4] site The Fe≠S distances in the [Fe(SCys)4] site of PaRd W4L/ ∞ R5S/A44S were an average of 0.0158 A larger than those in PaRd W4L/R5S as a result of crystal nonisomorphism (Fig. 4a). The shorter bonds between Fe54 and the partially surface exposed ligand atoms Cys9-Sc and Cys42-Sc showed a larger increase in bond length (0.0183 and ∞ 0.0190 A, respectively) than the longer bonds towards the buried ligand atoms Cys6-Sc and Cys39-Sc (0.0139 and ∞ 0.0123 A, respectively). The Sc≠Fe54≠Sc bond angles were changed by up to 1∞ (Fig. 4b). In this case comparison with the second ultrahigh-resolution structure mentioned earlier indicated that

N≠H¡¡¡Sc hydrogen bonds PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S contains the canonical set of six N≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bonds found in all rubredoxins [3] (Fig. 1). The electron density for all corresponding hydrogen atoms was visible in a rA-weighted residual electron density map before inclusion of hydrogen atoms in the refinement. The positions of hydrogen atoms were not refined and the analysis of hydrogen-bond stereochemistry was based on the positions of riding hydrogen atoms with ∞ shortened N≠H distances (0.88 A) as defined in SHELXL (Fig. 4c). The estimated standard deviations for D¡¡¡A ∞ distances were usually 0.005 A for both models. The bond distances of all N≠H¡¡¡S≠Fe hydrogen bonds in PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S were larger than those in PaRd W4L/R5S as a result of crystal nonisomorphism (Fig. 4c). Four hydrogen bonds which were not affected by the A44S mutation (Ile8-N¡¡¡Cys6-Sc, Tyr11-N¡¡¡Cys9-Sc, Ile41-N¡¡¡Cys39-Sc and Cys42-N¡¡¡Cys39-Sc) showed an increase in D¡¡¡A distances by 0.026 (∆0.006) 0.026 ∞ (∆0.008), 0.013 (∆0.008) and 0.043 (∆0.007) A, respectively. These values were comparable to an average ∞ increase of D¡¡¡A distances of 0.023 A calculated for 24 main chain≠main chain hydrogen bonds in the molecule. The hydrogen bond Xaa44-N¡¡¡Cys42-Sc showed a significantly larger increase of the D¡¡¡A distance of ∞ 0.104 ∆ 0.008 A through the displacement of the main chain by the A44S mutation. This change in cluster hydrogen bond length was expected to have an effect on the reduction potential. A similar increase in D¡¡¡A distance ∞ (0.091 ∆ 0.015 A) was observed for hydrogen bond Cys9N¡¡¡Cys6-Sc, but this deviation could be attributed to a model building artifact and most likely did not affect the reduction potential in vivo. The refined model of PaRd W4L/R5S [19] (Protein Data Bank entry 1YK4) contained two alternative main-chain conformations around Ile8 and a reinspection of the electron density map showed that the amide group with Cys9-H0 of the main conformer was not well fitted to the density, causing the observed deviation in hydrogen-bond length. No evidence was found that this difference could have been caused by the A44S mutation.

Reduction potential these changes were not caused by crystal nonisomorphism and reflected a minimal distortion of the [Fe(SCys)4] cluster by the A44S mutation. Characterization by UV≠vis, electron paramagnetic ® resonance, Mossbauer and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy did not reveal significant structural differences between PaRd W4L/R5S and W4L/R5S/A44S [30]. The reduction potential of mutant PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S was determined to be +20 ∆ 10 mV, compared with ¿36 ∆ 10 mV for PaRd W4L/R5S, which corresponded to an increase of the reduction potential of 56 ∆ 20 mV. This increase in reduction potential could be attributed unambiguously to changes in hydrogen bonding towards the [Fe(SCys)4] site. The comparative analysis of the structures did not provide any evidence for significant changes in

123

1169

other parameters known to influence the reduction potential, like cluster stereochemistry, molecule flexibility and solvent accessibility. The A44S mutation allowed the formation of an additional hydrogen bond Ser44-Oc¡¡¡Cys42Sc towards the [Fe(SCys)4] site, which increased the reduction potential. D≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bonds decrease the covalency of iron≠sulfur bonds, i.e., the amount of charge transferred from the ligand to the iron ion, which stabilizes the reduced state and increases the reduction potential [13]. At the same time, the D¡¡¡A distance for hydrogen bond ∞ Ser44-N-H¡¡¡Cys42-Sc was increased by 0.104 ∆ 0.008 A, which should decrease the reduction potential. Taking into account an estimated average increase of the D¡¡¡A ∞ hydrogen bond distances of 0.02≠0.03 A caused by molecule expansion, we calculate the net increase of the D¡¡¡A ∞ distance to be approximately 0.08 A. Mutagenesis experiments with Clostridium pasteurianum rubredoxin revealed a strong and nearly linear correlation between the Xaa44N-H¡¡¡Cys42-Sc hydrogen-bond distance and the reduction potential [9, 17]. On the basis of these data, the increased length of hydrogen bond Ser44-N-H¡¡¡Cys42-Sc in PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S could be expected to cause a decrease of the reduction potential of approximately 10 mV compared with PaRd W4L/R5S. Thus, the net effect of the introduction of the hydrogen bond Ser44-Oc¡¡¡Cys42-Sc would be an increase of the reduction potential of 65 ∆ 20 mV. This value is in good agreement with the reduction potential shifts of 68, 44 ∆ 25, 56 ∆ 9 and 59 mV found experimentally for the removal of an O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bond in Rieske protein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Paracoccus denitrificans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bovine mitochondrial bc1 complex, respectively. In these mutagenesis experiments a conserved Tyr≠O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe1 hydrogen bond, which was used as a template for the design of the PaRd W4L/R5S/A44S mutant, was removed by a Tyr ? Phe mutation [8, 32≠35]. The structural effects of this mutation were investigated by atomic-resolution X-ray crystallography in the Rieske protein from R. sphaeroides. It was shown that the Tyr ? Phe mutation did not have any structural side effects and that the decrease in reduction potential was caused exclusively by removal of the Tyr≠O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe1 hydrogen bond [8]. Thus, the available experimental data for high-potential respiratory Rieske proteins and PaRd based on site-directed mutagenesis and high-resolution X-ray structures are consistent and suggest that a single O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe cluster hydrogen bond towards a cysteine ligand increases the reduction potential by around 60 mV. A comparable decrease of the reduction potential by the removal of cluster hydrogen bonds has also been reported in other studies on iron≠sulfur proteins. However, the interpretation of these results was complicated by the lack

of high-resolution structural data needed to assess the side effects of the mutations or the problem of quantifying the contributions from different types of cluster hydrogen bonds. As an example, Hunsicker-Wang et al. [10] found a rough correlation between the number of cluster hydrogen bonds and the reduction potential by comparing X-ray structures of different Rieske and Rieske-type proteins. On the basis of the assumption that O≠H¡¡¡S hydrogen bonds are twice as strong as N≠H¡¡¡S hydrogen bonds, they estimated the contribution of a weighted cluster hydrogen bond to be approximately 70 mV, corresponding to 70 mV for N≠H¡¡¡S hydrogen bonds and 140 mV for O≠H¡¡¡S hydrogen bonds. However, this approach did not take into account that the impact of D≠H¡¡¡S≠Fe hydrogen bonds towards inorganic bridging sulfur on the reduction potential is roughly twice as strong as that of D≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bonds towards cysteine ligands, as shown by mutagenesis studies in Rieske proteins from S. cerevisiae and bovine mitochondrial bc1 complex [32, 33]. Moreover, as pointed out by the authors, it could not be excluded that the reduction potentials were affected by other structural parameters like solvent accessibility of the histidine ligands. Carter [4] found a strong correlation between the midpoint reduction potential and the number of possible NH donors available to the [4Fe≠4S] cluster in high-potential iron protein (HiPIP), ferredoxin and model substances. According to this model the formation or strengthening of an N≠H¡¡¡S≠Fe hydrogen bond increased the midpoint potential by 72≠80 mV. Differences in the contribution of individual cluster hydrogen bonds and the potential influence of other structural parameters were not taken into account. In other relevant studies on N≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bonds three-dimensional structures were not available; thus, the reported shifts in reduction potential could not be assigned with certainty to cluster hydrogen bonding alone. For example, an S79P mutation in Chromatium vinosum HiPIP reduced the reduction potential by 104 ∆ 4 mV probably by affecting an N≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bond [36]. In Rhodocyclus tenuis HiPIP removal of two different N≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bonds by introduction of ester linkages reduced the reduction potential by 126 ∆ 20 and 86 ∆ 20 mV, respectively [37]. Studies on [4Fe≠4S] cubane-type analogue complexes showed that introduction of a single O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bond increased the reduction potential by 130 mV [38]. In summary, this study provides a reliable quantitative estimate for the effect of hydrogen bonding on the reduction potential in rubredoxin and iron≠sulfur proteins in general. It confirms that the formation of N≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe and O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bonds is an effective mechanism for fine-tuning of the reduction potential. It is in line with

recent results for O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bonding in [2Fe≠ 2S] Rieske proteins and suggests that the introduction of an O≠H¡¡¡Sc≠Fe hydrogen bond will increase the reduction potential of iron≠sulfur proteins by approximately 65 mV.

for these rubredoxin variants provides a very interesting model system for the analysis of cluster hydrogen bonding by ultrahigh-resolution crystallographic methods (charge density refinement, quantum refinement) and computational chemistry (molecular modeling, density functional theory).

Concluding remarks Numerous experimental and theoretical studies on naturally occurring or designed variants of iron≠sulfur proteins, including the work presented here, have shown the importance of cluster hydrogen bonding for the adjustment of the reduction potential and have provided quantitative data for the impact of single hydrogen bonds. However, a quantitative analysis that can account for differences in individual contributions and additive effects from several cluster hydrogen bonds is still not straightforward. Such an approach could be based on the number and the stereochemistry of cluster hydrogen bonds [9, 10], the electronic structure of the active site or the contribution of hydrogen bonding to the free energy of the system. A prerequisite for such a rigorous quantitative treatment is atomic-resolution or subatomic-resolution structures of the molecular species involved. For a system like rubredoxin which undergoes very small but functionally significant structural changes during the redox cycle, the availability of high-resolution structures for each variant in oxidized and reduced states would be beneficial [9, 17]. Because protein crystals of PaRd W4L/R5S and W4L/ R5S/A44S in the reduced state diffracting to atomic or subatomic resolution are still not available, this site-directed mutagenesis study had to focus on the oxidized state only. However, it illustrates the need for high-resolution structures in structure≠function studies of metalloproteins and provides another example for the benefits of ultrahighresolution protein X-ray crystallography. The capability to observe electron density for hydrogen atoms provided direct experimental evidence for the formation of the designed hydrogen bond Ser44-Oc¡¡¡Cys42-Sc (and allowed refinement of its stereochemical parameters). Refinement against ultrahigh-resolution data provided complete and very precise structural models that allowed detection of minimal but functionally significant structural differences between both variants. Differences in bond distances of the prosthetic ∞ group as small as 0.01 A could be detected with high significance. At this level of precision, structural variation caused by crystal nonisomorphism, data quality and (potentially) radiation damage is detectable and has to be accounted for. Additional investigations are needed to assess the effect of these parameters on the comparative stereochemical analysis of metalloproteins at atomic and ultrahigh resolution. The exceptional quality and information content of the electron density maps and refined models
