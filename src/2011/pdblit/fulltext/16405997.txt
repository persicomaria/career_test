Transcription factor IIIA of Xenopus laevis serves a dual function during oogenesis and early development: this zinc ®nger protein binds to the internal promoter element of the 5 S ribosomal RNA genes and acts as a positive transcription factor; additionally, the protein functions in 5 S RNA storage. The central four zinc ®ngers (zf4-7) of the nine-®nger protein have been shown to bind 5 S rRNA with comparable or higher af®nity than the full-length protein. The role of ®nger seven in binding af®nity has been examined by deletion analysis. A zf4-6 protein binds 5 S RNA with about a sevenfold reduction in binding af®nity, compared to zf4-7. The effect of non-speci®c competitor DNA on binding af®nities of the zinc ®nger peptides was examined and found to have a signi®cant effect on the measured af®nities of these peptides for full-length and truncated versions of 5 S RNA. The interaction of zf4-6 with full-length 5 S RNA was far more sensitive to non-speci®c competitor concentration than was the zf4-7:5 S RNA interaction, suggesting that ®nger seven contributes to both af®nity and speci®city in this protein:RNA interaction. In order to map zinc ®nger binding sites on the 5 S RNA molecule, we generated truncated versions of the RNA and tested these molecules for their binding af®nities with zf4-7 and zf4-6. Previous studies showed that a 75 nucleotide long RNA, comprising loop A, helix II, helix V, region E and helix IV, bound zf4-7 with high af®nity. Selection and ampli®cation binding assays (selex) have now been used to generate smaller high-af®nity binding RNAs. We ®nd that a 55 nucleotide long RNA, comprising loop A, helix V, region E and helix IV, but lacking helix II, retains high af®nity for zf4-6. These data are consistent with the proposal that ®ngers 4-6 bind this central core of 5 S RNA and that ®nger seven binds the helix II region.

Introduction
Transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) serves as both a positive transcription factor for the 5 S ribosomal RNA genes and as a 5 S RNA storage particle protein in developing oocytes of the amphibian Xenopus (Engelke et al., 1980; Honda & Roeder, 1980; Pelham & Brown, 1980). TFIIIA binds with high af®nity (Kd 4 $ 1 nM) to both the 5 S RNA

genes and to 5 S RNA. Protease digestion of TFIIIA in the 7 S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle separates a 30 kDa nucleic acid binding domain, containing nine zinc ®nger motifs (Miller et al., 1985), from a 10 kDa carboxy-terminal transcriptional activation domain (Hayes et al., 1989; Mao & Darby, 1993; Smith et al., 1984). Binding of TFIIIA to the tripartite internal control region of the gene (containing A-block, intermediate and C-block sequence elements) is the ®rst step in the assembly of the active 5 S RNA gene transcription complex containing, in addition to TFIIIA, the other general class III transcription factors TFIIIB and TFIIIC (reviewed by White, 1998).

550 and mutational studies have addressed the mechanism for DNA binding by the zinc ®ngers of TFIIIA (reviewed by White, 1998). These studies have led to a model where zinc ®ngers 1-3 bind in the major groove of the C-block promoter element, ®nger 5 binds in the major groove of the intermediate element and ®ngers 7-9 bind in the major groove of the A-block element. Fingers 4 and 6 each bind in or across the minor groove, spanning these promoter elements (Clemens et al., 1992; Hayes & Clemens, 1992; Hayes & Tullius, 1992). The major features of this model have been con®rmed by nuclear magnetic resonance studies of a complex between the three amino-terminal zinc ®ngers (zf1-3) and a C-block double-stranded oligonucleotide (Wuttke et al., 1997) and by a recent X-ray structure of zinc ®ngers 1-6 bound to DNA (Nolte et al., 1998). The second essential function of TFIIIA is binding to 5 S RNA in the cytoplasm of immature oocytes (Honda & Roeder, 1980; Pelham & Brown, 1980). The resulting 7 S RNP particle stabilizes the RNA until it is required for ribosome assembly. Early studies documented that the full zinc ®nger region of the protein contacts both types of nucleic acids in either the TFIIIA-5 S DNA or TFIIIA-5 S RNA complexes (Smith et al., 1984). Thus, there has been considerable interest in determining how this protein interacts speci®cally with the coding region of the 5 S RNA gene, and with the transcript of this gene. Interestingly, Xenopus oocytes contain a second nine-®nger 5 S RNA storage particle protein, termed p43, that binds 5 S RNA exclusively (Joho et al., 1990). Comparisons between TFIIIA and p43, and mutagenesis experiments based on these comparisons (Choo & Klug, 1993; Clemens et al., 1993, 1994; Darby & Joho, 1992), have advanced our understanding of the roles played by individual zinc ®ngers and sets of zinc ®ngers in specifying either 5 S DNA or 5 S RNA binding. The results of footprinting and mutagenesis studies have indicated that the TFIIIA binding site on 5 S RNA consists of approximately the central two-thirds of the molecule (for a review and complete references, see McBryant et al., 1995). However, almost the entire 5 S RNA molecule is required to maintain the unique three-dimensional shape necessary for optimal binding of TFIIIA. From an analysis of TFIIIA binding af®nities with an extensive series of 5 S RNA substitution mutants, it has been suggested that the protein relies on a combination of many weak sequencespeci®c interactions along with the 5 S RNA structure in forming the 7 S RNP complex (You et al., 1991). Using a series of zinc ®nger deletion mutants of TFIIIA, Clemens et al. (1993) showed that the central four zinc ®ngers (zf4-7) of the protein were suf®cient for high af®nity interactions with 5 S RNA and Setzer and colleagues showed that broken-®nger mutations in ®ngers 4 through 7 had the most severe effects on 5 S RNA binding (Setzer et al., 1996). Similarly, proteolytic footprinting of TFIIIA within the 7 S RNP reveals that

Zinc Finger-binding Domain of 5 S RNA

®ngers 4-7 are most tightly associated with the RNA (Bogenhagen, 1993). Moreover, the interaction of zf4-7 with 5 S RNA provides the majority of the binding energy for the interaction of TFIIIA with 5 S RNA, just as the interaction of zf1-3 with the C-block promoter element provides the majority of the binding energy for the DNA complex. Thus, TFIIIA can be thought of as a compromise of evolution: a fusion of three amino-terminal DNA-binding zinc ®ngers and four central RNAbinding zinc ®ngers. The carboxy-terminal ®ngers play an important function in DNA binding in placing the activation domain in the proper orientation for assembly of the transcription complex. It must be stressed, however, that each of the nine ®ngers of the full-length protein makes either structure or sequence-speci®c contacts with both nucleic acids in the two different complexes and comparisons of binding af®nities of individual domains of the protein likely ignore important ®nger-®nger interactions within the full nine-®nger protein (Kehres et al., 1977; Setzer et al., 1996). For DNA binding zinc ®nger proteins, the results of mutagenesis/phage display and structural studies have shown that amino acid residues at positions À1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 of the a-helix region within each ®nger domain are primarily responsible for base-speci®c DNA recognition (Choo & Klug, 1994a,b; Nolte et al., 1998; Pavletich & Pabo, 1991, 1993; Rebar & Pabo, 1994; Wu et al., 1995; Wuttke et al., 1997; Zang et al., 1995). Our mutagenesis studies (Clemens et al., 1993) and a recent phage display mutagenesis study (Friesen & Darby, 1997) suggest that amino acids at or near the beginning of the a-helix of ®ngers 4 and 6 are also important for RNA recognition; however, no detailed structural information is available as yet on the mode of interaction of zinc ®ngers with RNA. In the present study, we sought to determine the relative binding af®nities of recombinant polypeptides encoding the RNA-speci®c zinc ®ngers for full-length and truncated versions of 5 S RNA and to de®ne the minimal domain of 5 S RNA which retains high af®nity for these zinc ®nger polypeptides. Such information will ultimately be useful for the generation of materials for structural studies. We ®nd that a domain of 5 S RNA comprising loop A and the long helix IV, region E, helix V retains high af®nity for both zf4-7 and zf4-6.

Results
Binding affinities of zf4-6 and zf4-7 for wild-type 5 S RNA We previously reported that TFIIIA zinc ®ngers 4-7 (zf4-7) represent the minimal set of ®ngers responsible for high af®nity binding to 5 S RNA (Clemens et al., 1993). Subsequently, we found that zf4-7 binds 5 S RNA with a higher af®nity (Kd $ 0.6 nM) than the full-length frog protein or a

recombinant protein containing all nine ®ngers (zf1-9; Kd $ 1.1 nM) (McBryant et al., 1995). A similar value has been reported for zf4-9 binding to 5 S RNA (Setzer et al., 1996) and another group has reported an even higher af®nity for the zf4-7:5 S RNA interaction (Kd  0.1 nM; Friesen & Darby, 1997). These results contrast with those presented by other laboratories using either in vitro translated proteins or large fusion proteins and qualitative binding assays (Darby & Joho, 1992; Theunissen et al., 1992). Pieler and colleagues reported that zinc ®ngers 4-6 were suf®cient for binding 5 S RNA and concluded that these ®ngers represent the RNA-binding domain of the protein (Theunissen et al., 1992, 1998). Since these latter studies did not report binding constants or relative af®nities for the various zinc ®nger polypeptides, we cloned and expressed a polypeptide containing ®ngers 4-6 (see Materials and Methods) and measured the binding af®nity of this polypeptide and zf4-7 with 5 S RNA. Binding reactions containing various concentrations of protein and a constant trace amount of radiolabeled 5 S RNA (2.5 to 5 pM ®nal concentration) were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Figure 1(a) and (b)). Phosphorimage analysis was used to generate plots of fractional RNA bound versus protein concentration (Figure 1(c)). Previous measurements from our laboratory have included poly(dI-dC) as a nonspeci®c competitor in binding reactions; however, no non-speci®c competitor was included in the experiment shown in Figure 1 and the effects of competitor nucleic acid will be considered below. Under these conditions, zf4-7 binds 5 S RNA in a bimolecular complex with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.12(Æ0.02) nM (standard error for three determinations). Fitting the data to the Hill equation (Figure 1(c)) reveals a Hill coef®cient of approximately 1.0, suggesting no cooperativity in formation of the zf4-7:5 S RNA complex. In contrast to zf4-7, with increasing concentrations of zf46, the RNA is ®rst converted into a binary complex and, at higher protein concentrations, slower migrating complexes appear (Figure 1(b)). These latter complexes likely re¯ect the non-speci®c binding of additional molecules of zf4-6 to 5 S RNA. At high input protein concentrations, these multimeric zf4-6:5 S RNA complexes predominate over the speci®c bimolecular complex (Figure 1(b)). This behavior is not observed for zf4-7 (Figure 1(a)). Under these circumstances, it is dif®cult to determine a dissociation constant for the bimolecular binding reaction for zf4-6 (Figure 1(c)): a plot of fraction RNA bound versus protein concentration does not yield the expected Hill coef®cient of 1 for this binding reaction (Hill coef®cient $0.5-0.6). However, the concentration of zf4-6 required to half-saturate the radiolabeled RNA is approximately 0.8 nM, suggesting about a sevenfold loss in binding af®nity due to deletion of zinc ®nger seven.

(c) Binding curves were obtained from phosphorimager analysis of the dried gels. Data were ®t to the Hill equation using Kaleidagraph software. Squares denote data for zf4-7 and triangles denote data for zf4-6.

Since these af®nity measurements were made with two different protein preparations which could differ from one another in the fraction of active molecules, we performed RNA titration experiments with constant amounts of protein to directly determine the fraction of active species in each sample. These experiments utilized a trace amount of labeled 5 S RNA (approximately 40 pM

552 ®nal concentration) and various amounts of unlabeled RNA. After gel electrophoresis and phosphorimage analysis, Scatchard plots (Setzer et al., 1996) were used to calculate the fraction of active protein (data not shown). Comparing these values to total input protein concentrations, we conclude that our preparations of zf4-6 and zf4-7 contain 85(Æ4)% and 103(Æ6)% active molecules, respectively. The estimates for total protein concentrations are based on amino acid analysis, and are likely to be accurate to within 10 % variation. Thus, within the uncertainty of both determinations, we conclude that the vast majority of the molecules in each protein sample are capable of binding 5 S RNA. Effect of non-specific competitor nucleic acid on binding affinities Our previous measurements of binding constants for zinc ®nger peptide:5 S RNA complexes contained poly(dI-dC) as a non-speci®c competitor. Under these conditions, the majority of the input 5 S RNA is converted into the simple bimolecular

Zinc Finger-binding Domain of 5 S RNA

complex with zf4-6 (Figure 2(a)). Only at high input protein concentrations is there a signi®cant fraction of complexes containing multiple copies of zf4-6. In the presence of 10 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), we estimate that zf4-6 binds 5 S RNA with a Kd value of 8.3(Æ1.5) nM and exhibits a Hill coef®cient of approximately 1.0 (Figure 2(b)). Under the same reaction conditions zf4-7 binds 5 S RNA with a Kd value of 0.34(Æ0.04) nM (Figure 2(b)). Thus, in the presence of poly(dI-dC), deletion of zinc ®nger seven from zf4-7 appears to result in a $24-fold loss in binding af®nity for 5 S RNA. However, since poly(dI-dC) appears to have a more pronounced effect on the binding af®nity of 5 S RNA for zf4-6 than for zf4-7, this comparison may not be valid. To assess the relative non-speci®c binding af®nities of the two zinc ®nger peptides, we performed a titration experiment with increasing amounts of poly(dI-dC) at a constant input amount of each zinc ®nger protein. We ®nd that the amount of poly(dI-dC) required to displace 50 % of these zinc ®nger peptide:5 S RNA complexes is about tenfold higher for zf4-7 than for zf4-6 (data not shown). This suggests that deletion of ®nger

553 slower migrating species are observed for both the fast and slow migrating RNAs, with multiple slow migrating species (denoted with arrows in Figure 4(a)). We suspect that the higher mobility RNAs and RNA-protein complexes might correspond to properly folded RNAs and complexes while the slower migrating RNA and complexes might be unfolded or not properly folded. Based on these considerations, we puri®ed RNA from the fastest migrating protein:RNA complex on the non-denaturing gel for use in subsequent RT-PCR, T7 RNA polymerase transcription and selection steps. At each round of selection, a protein titration was performed and the amount of protein which bound approximately 5 % of the input RNA was used for subsequent rounds of selection and ampli®cation. Based on the protein titrations performed at each selex cycle (with 10 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)), apparent dissociation constants were obtained (Table 1). The starting RNA population bound zf4-7 with quite low af®nity (Kd $ 150 nM; Figure 4(a)); however, and as expected, the af®nity of zf4-7 for the selected RNAs increased with each round of selection. Since the fourth round selected RNA population bound both zf4-7 and zf4-6 with comparable or higher af®nity than that observed for zf4-6 binding to wild-type full-length 5 S RNA (Table 1), this RNA was used for a ®nal cycle of RT-PCR and the PCR product was cloned in pUC18. Figure 4(b) shows a binding titration for zf4-6 with the RNA population after four rounds of selection. An apparent dissociation constant of 6.4 nM was derived from these data (Figure 4(d)), a value similar to the Kd value for zf4-6 binding to full-length 5 S RNA under the same binding conditions (Table 1; reactions containing poly(dI-dC)). These data strongly suggest that ®ngers 4-6 bind the loop A-helix IV-region E-helix V domain within 5 S RNA. Nineteen randomly selected clones were sequenced and a consensus sequence (U/A, U/C, U, U) was derived (Table 2). Three clones that matched consensus (with tetraloop sequences UUUU, UCUU and AUUU) were chosen for

seven in zf4-6 has caused a pronounced loss in both af®nity and in sequence speci®city compared to zf4-7. Thus, while we con®rm that zf4-6 possesses a relatively high af®nity for 5 S RNA (Theunissen et al., 1992, 1998), our quantitative analysis suggests that zinc ®ngers 4-7 represent the high-af®nity RNA-binding domain of TFIIIA. Minimal domain of 5 S RNA necessary for zinc finger interactions We previously reported that a truncated, 75 base long version of 5 S RNA, comprising the central core of the molecule, is suf®cient for high af®nity interactions with zf4-7 (McBryant et al., 1995). This molecule contains the loop A, helix II, loop D, helix IV, region E, and helix V regions of 5 S RNA (Figure 3(a)) and binds zf4-7 with a Kd value of 1.8 nM (in reactions containing poly(dI-dC); McBryant et al., 1995). Based on the presence of the DNA binding site for zinc ®nger seven in a double helical region of 5 S RNA (helix II), we proposed that this helix is the site of interaction of ®nger seven with 5 S RNA (Clemens et al., 1993). To test this hypothesis, we generated a 55 base long RNA molecule lacking helix II. This RNA was transcribed from a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter followed by the coding region for the RNA shown in Figure 3(b). In order to delete helix II and to close loop A, we added a mixed sequence tetraloop (comprising all four nucleotides at each position), along with the two C ÁG base-pairs present at positions 14 and 15 of the wild-type molecule. We retained these two base-pairs since mutations at these positions reduce the binding af®nity of zf4-7 for 5 S RNA by $25-fold (McBryant et al., 1995). A mixed sequence tetraloop was chosen to close off loop A, since we had no a priori knowledge as to what RNA structure might stabilize loop A. RNA was synthesized from this template with T7 RNA polymerase and RNA molecules that bind zf4-6 and zf4-7 with high af®nity were then selected from this mixed sequence population using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis to separate bound and free RNAs. We used a standard selex procedure (Tuerk & Gold, 1990) for isolation of high af®nity binding RNAs from the mixed sequence population. Selex was performed with zf4-7 protein since this domain of TFIIIA binds 5 S RNA with highest af®nity (see above and Clemens et al., 1993). Figure 4(a) shows the distribution of bound and unbound RNAs analyzed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with increasing concentrations of zf4-7 protein. Note that in the absence of protein, the free RNA gives rise to a fast migrating species and slower migrating RNAs. Since all of the RNAs are of the same size (and run at the same position on a denaturing gel), this spectrum of mobilities is likely due to different secondary structures for the RNA molecules in this population. With increasing amounts of zf4-7 protein,

further study. No clone containing an ACUU tetraloop was obtained. Radiolabeled RNAs were transcribed from PCR products derived from these three clones and these RNAs were used in binding titrations with zf4-6 and zf4-7 (Table 3). Figure 4(c) shows one example of these gel mobility shift assays: the 55-mer RNA containing the tetraloop sequence UCUU had the highest af®nity for zf4-6 (Kd  3.4 nM in the presence of poly(dI-dC); Figure 4(d)). Binding af®nities for this selected RNA were also determined in reactions lacking poly(dI-dC) (Figure 5(a) and (b)) and Kd values of 0.91(Æ0.15) nM and 0.66(Æ0.16) nM were obtained for zf4-6 and zf4-7, respectively (Figure 5(c) and Table 3). Interestingly, only a single zf4-6:55mer RNA complex was observed in these binding reactions, suggesting that the 55mer lacks the nonspeci®c binding sites for zf4-6 that are present in full-length 5 S RNA. A comparison of the binding af®nities of zf4-7 for 5 S RNA and the UCUU

55-mer reveals a $5 to 13-fold reduction in binding af®nity for the smaller RNA compared to fulllength 5 S RNA (depending upon the presence or absence of poly(dI-dC) in the reactions), corresponding to a ÁÁGo value of $1 to 2 kcal/mol. The RNAs containing AUUU and UUUU tetraloops each bound zf4-6 with a Kd value of approximately 10 nM. The AUUU tetraloop RNA bound both proteins with similar af®nities; however, the UUUU RNA had a higher af®nity for zf4-7 than for zf4-6. We do not know the explanation for this difference in af®nities.

Discussion
Our current results are consistent with earlier mutagenesis studies of 5 S RNA (You et al., 1991) and measurements of the binding af®nities of zinc ®nger polypeptides for both full-length 5 S RNA and truncated derivatives of 5 S RNA (Clemens

et al., 1993; McBryant et al., 1995). Romaniuk and colleagues have generated an extensive series of substitution mutations within 5 S RNA and, based on an analysis of the binding af®nities for TFIIIA, have concluded that the central two-thirds of the RNA molecule is critical for high af®nity interactions with the protein (Baudin & Romaniuk, 1989; Baudin et al., 1991; Romaniuk, 1989; You et al., 1991; You & Romaniuk, 1990). This region corresponds closely to the binding site for zinc ®ngers 4-7, as deduced from RNase protection experiments (McBryant et al., 1995). Our present results con®rm that ®ngers 4-7, in isolation, have the highest binding af®nity for 5 S RNA, suggesting that these zinc ®ngers contribute most to the overall binding af®nity of the full-length protein. Similarly, broken ®nger mutations in ®ngers 4-7 have the most pronounced effects on 5 S RNA binding af®nity in the context of the fulllength protein (Setzer et al., 1996). Further, we have shown that a 75 nucleotide long RNA, corresponding to the central region of the RNA, exhibits a high binding af®nity for both zf4-7 and TFIIIA (McBryant et al., 1995). Taken together, our data are thus consistent with zf4-7 binding to the loop A-helix II-helix IV-region E-helix V core of 5 S RNA. Within this region of the RNA molecule, some nucleotides are essential for high af®nity binding of the protein, while other nucleotides confer structural features which are essential for protein binding (reviewed by McBryant et al., 1995). Interestingly, the negative effects of base substitutions in base-paired regions of the molecule can generally be overcome by compensatory mutations which restore base-pairing. Within these helical regions, the actual identity of the individual basepairs does not appear critical. A notable exception to this observation is the pair of C ÁG base-pairs at nucleotide positions 14 and 15 of the full-length RNA: disruption of these base-pairs reduces binding af®nity for zf4-7 by $25-fold; however, restoring base-pairing by changing the C ÁG base-pairs to G ÁC base-pairs does not fully restore binding af®nity (McBryant et al., 1995). Thus, we retained these two base-pairs in our design of a small RNA for binding zf4-6.

Based on the presence of the DNA binding sites for ®ngers 5 and 7 in duplex regions of 5 S RNA, we previously postulated that helices V and II are the respective binding sites for these zinc ®ngers in 5 S RNA (Clemens et al., 1993). To assess this possibility, we generated a small RNA, lacking helix II, but containing loop A and the helix IV-region E-helix V domain of 5 S RNA (Figure 3(b)). Based upon a selex procedure, we derived a consensus sequence (U/A, U/C, U, U) for tetraloops which conferred high af®nity binding of this truncated RNA molecule with either zf4-6 or zf4-7. The ®nding that these selected molecules, lacking helix II, bind zf4-6 with comparable or higher af®nities than full-length 5 S RNA is thus consistent with the notion that helix II is the binding site for ®nger 7; however, further biochemical and structural studies will be needed to establish the exact binding site for individual zinc ®ngers on 5 S RNA. It was somewhat surprising that zf4-7 also bound these selected 55-mer RNAs with comparable af®nity as zf4-6 (Figures 4 and 5, Tables 1 and 3). This suggests that, in the absence of helix II, ®nger 7 does not hinder the binding activity of the ®ngers 4-6 in the context of the four-®nger protein zf4-7. At this time, we have no explanation for why a U-rich tetraloop was selected as the preferred structure for closing off loop A; however, stable Urich tetraloops have been identi®ed in a number of natural RNAs and their structures have been determined (Akke et al., 1997; Jucker & Pardi, 1995; Molinaro & Tinoco, 1995). Future structural studies will elucidate the mechanism whereby this tetraloop stabilizes the folded structure of this small RNA. Pieler and colleagues (Theunissen et al., 1998) have also generated a truncated version of 5 S RNA which is active in binding a recombinant fusion protein containing zinc ®ngers 4-6; however, the 63 nucleotide long RNA molecule they generated contained helix II. Our studies show that most of helix II is dispensable for high af®nity binding by zf4-6. Based on previous studies (Clemens et al., 1993; McBryant et al., 1995) and our current results, deletion of ®nger 7 in either zf4-7 or zf1-7 and deletion or mutations within helix II have comparable effects on the binding af®nities of the zinc ®nger

polypeptides. If we are correct about the location of ®ngers 5 and 7, it is highly likely that these ®ngers interact with duplex regions of 5 S RNA, since base-pairing of helices II and V is critical for zf4-7 binding to 5 S RNA (McBryant et al., 1995). Additionally, these interactions may be in the major groove of 5 S RNA, since these ®ngers participate in major groove contacts with DNA (Clemens et al., 1992; Nolte et al., 1998). Recently, Pieler and colleagues have mapped phosphate contacts made by TFIIIA with 5 S RNA to helices II and V and to loop C (Theunissen et al., 1998). For helix II, these contacts are with the two G residues proximal to loop A (G64 and G65), included in our 55-mer RNA. Consistent with predictions for the location of ®ngers 4-6, these contacts are restricted to helices II and V for zf4-6. We proposed that loop A is the binding site for ®nger 6 and region E is the binding site for ®nger 4. Again, mutations in ®ngers 4 and 6 (Clemens et al., 1993; Friesen &

Darby, 1997; Setzer et al., 1996) and mutations in region E and loop A of 5 S RNA (McBryant et al., 1995; Rawlings et al., 1996; You et al., 1991) have comparable and pronounced effects on binding af®nities; however, no data are available that directly address the location of these zinc ®ngers within the central core of 5 S RNA. Again, structural studies will be needed to precisely map these ®nger locations on 5 S RNA. Finally, with regard to RNA recognition by the zinc ®ngers of TFIIIA, mutagenesis studies have clearly identi®ed amino acid residues at or near the start of the a-helices of ®ngers 4 and 6 as important for high af®nity binding (Clemens et al., 1993; Friesen & Darby, 1997; Theunissen et al., 1998). It remains to be determined, however, whether these ®ngers interact with RNA in the major groove, as for DNA recognition by zinc ®nger proteins, or whether ®ngers 4 and 6 make contact with unpaired regions of RNA or with the minor groove.

tural studies have established that ®ngers 4 and 6 do not interact with DNA in the major groove but rather span the minor groove to bridge major groove-binding ®ngers (Clemens et al., 1992; McBryant et al., 1996; Neely et al., 1997; Nolte et al., 1998), thus it is reasonable to suspect that these ®ngers will not bind in the major groove of duplex RNA. Resolution of this question must await structural studies of these zinc ®nger peptide:RNA complexes.

Materials and Methods
Zinc finger proteins An expression clone for zinc ®ngers 4-7 (zf4-7) has been described (Clemens et al., 1993) and protein was puri®ed as described (McBryant et al., 1995). The TFIIIA coding sequence for zf4-6 (amino acid residues 105 to 191 with the addition of an N-terminal methonine) was ampli®ed from the TFIIIA cDNA (Ginsberg et al., 1984) by the polymerase chain reaction. The initiating primer for the N terminus, 5H -CCATAACATCAAGATCCATATGTATGTGTGCCATTTTG-3H , contained an NdeI restriction site (underlined), the last three bases of which formed the start codon. The terminating primer contained an EcoRI restriction site (underlined): 5H CACACATCACGAATTCCTTAGTCCTGATGGCATTCTGCC-3H . The PCR product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and cloned into the expression vector pET22b() (Novagen), which had been similarly digested with NdeI and EcoRI and transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5a. For protein expression, plasmid DNA was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS. The DNA sequence of the zf4-6 coding region was veri®ed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. After transformation, cells were plated on minimal media with carbenicillin for 14 hours at 37  C (Stratagene). Starter minimal media cultures of 50 ml were innoculated with one colony and grown overnight at 37  C with 275 rpm shaking to 1.0 to 1.5 A600. One liter minimal media cultures were innoculated with 10 ml of the starter culture and incubated for ten hours at 25  C with 275 rpm shaking. Expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b,DFigure 5.

thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) upon reaching 0.8 A600. After incubation for ®ve more hours at 25  C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 minutes at 4  C, yielding an average wet cell weight of 3 g/l. Minimal media cultures contained M9 salts (6.7 g/l Na2HPO4, 3.0 g/l KH2PO4, 0.5 g/l NaCl) with trace metals (46 mM H3BO4, 102 mM CaCl2, 170 mM CoCl2, 0.8 mM CuSO4, 1 mM FeCl3, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM MnCl2, 102 mM ZnSO4), vitamins (10 ml/l GIBCO-BRL 100Â Eagle Basal medium vitamin solution in 0.85 % (w/v) NaCl), 50 mg/l carbenicillin, 3 g/l glucose, and 2 g/l (NH4)2SO4 or 2 g/l (15NH4)2SO4. Frozen cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 ml per 1 g cell paste: 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 50 mM K2SO4, 0.1 mM ZnSO4, 0.1 % (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ¯ouride) and lysed by sonication (Branson Soni®er 450) at 4  C using 25 constant bursts of 40 seconds each at power level 6 inter-

spersed with three minutes rests in an ice bath. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 minutes at 4  C and the supernatant was clari®ed by centrifugation at 48,000 g for 30 minutes at 4  C. The clari®ed lysate was loaded on a 5 ml HiTrap SP column (Amersham Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with cation exchange buffer (50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 50 mM K2SO4, 0.1 % 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM ZnSO4). The peptide zf4-6 was eluted by a salt gradient at 420 mM KCl. Pooled fractions were diluted twofold and loaded on a HiLoad 26/10 SP Sepharose FF column preceded by a 5 ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with cation exchange buffer. After detaching the HiTrap Q column, the zf4-6 was eluted by a salt gradient at 420 mM KCl. Pooled fractions were concentrated using an ultra®ltration stirred cell with 1 kDa molecular weight cutoff (YM1 membrane; Millipore Amicon) to 10 mg/ml as judged by UV absorption spectroscopy, using the calculated extinction coef®cient 11,200 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 277 nm (Gill & von Hippel, 1989). Aliquots (1 ml) of the concentrated sample were ®nally puri®ed by gel ®ltration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (Amersham Pharmacia) with gel ®ltration buffer (50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 50 mM K2SO4, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 50mM ZnSO4). Pooled fractions were concentrated to 1.0 mM using an ultra®ltration stirred cell with a YM1 membrane (Millipore Amicon). The purity of expressed peptide was judged by SDSPAGE on 18 % Tris-HCl Ready Gel (BioRad) and by analytical HPLC (Hitachi) in 0.1 % (v/v) tri¯uoroacetic acid with a single peak eluted at 31 % of the acetonitrile concentration gradient. The mass of the peak fraction from HPLC was determined by MALDI mass spectrometry to be 10,276 Da for unlabeled and 10,409 Da for 15N-labeled peptide which is in agreement with the expected mass of the peptide without zinc: 10,277 Da unlabeled and 10,410 Da for 133 15N atoms. Further characterization by NMR spectroscopy indicates that the peptide is folded and present in one conformation as judged by the 2D 15 N HSQC. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis performed in the Scripps Core Facility.

Zinc Finger-binding Domain of 5 S RNA tion. RNAs synthesized at each round of selection were transcribed with [a32P]GTP using the Ambion Megashortscript protocol while full-length 5 S RNA and the ®nal selected RNAs (see below) were transcribed as described (McBryant et al., 1995). RNAs were used in gel mobility shift assays with varying amounts of the recombinant proteins on 10 % (w/v) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Assay buffer consisted of 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.8), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM ZnSO4, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM dithiothreitol. Incubation was at ambient temperature (23  C) in 20 ml reactions in the presence or absence of 200 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Promega). Electrophoresis conditions were as described (McBryant et al., 1995). In some experiments, the concentration of protein was held constant and the RNA concentration was varied. These experiments utilized a trace amount of labeled 5 S RNA (approximately 40 pM) and unlabeled 5 S RNA synthesized with the AmpliScribe T7 transcription kit from Epicentre Technologies. RNA concentrations were determined by UV absorption after alkaline hydrolysis. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposure of the dried gels to Kodak Bio-Max X-ray ®lm and the fraction of RNA bound by protein as function of protein concentration was determined either by laser densitometry of the autoradiograms or with a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager and ImagQuant software. Data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) and were ®t to the Hill equation with a ¯oating Hill coef®cient.

Selection and amplification binding (selex) assays The 55-mer RNA, described above, was used as the starting RNA for a selection of high af®nity binding RNAs within this population. Selex assays (Tuerk & Gold, 1990) were performed with zf4-7 protein, since this domain of TFIIIA has been shown to bind 5 S RNA with highest af®nity (Clemens et al., 1993). At each round of selection, a protein titration was performed and an apparent dissociation constant was obtained from these data. The amount of protein which bound approximately 5 % of the input RNA was used for subsequent rounds of selection and ampli®cation. RNA was recovered from RNA:protein complexes by elution from a gel slice into buffer containing 1 % (w/v) SDS, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25 mM EDTA. Acrylamide was removed by ®ltration and RNA was phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated and used for reverse transcription. The 3H primer shown above was used in reverse transcription reactions (Promega Reverse Transcription System) to synthesize single-stranded cDNA, which was PCR ampli®ed using the 5H and 3H primers shown above, and was subsequently used as a template for T7 RNA polymerase transcription. RNA at each subsequent round of selection was treated similarly. After four rounds of selection and ampli®cation, the ®nal PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SmaI and cloned into similarly digested pUC18 DNA which had also been dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim Rapid Ligation Kit). Insert regions of randomly selected clones were sequenced by the dideoxy method using M13 -40 universal primer. Nineteen clones with inserts were sequenced and a consensus sequence was derived. Three clones that matched consensus were chosen for further study. The inserts were ampli®ed by PCR using the primers shown above. RNA was transcribed from these PCR products and used in binding reactions with zf4-6 and zf4-7.

Oligonucleotides, RNAs and binding assays Full-length 5 S RNA was obtained by T7 RNA polymerase transcription from DraI-digested plasmid DNA containing a synthetic oocyte-type 5 S RNA gene (Romaniuk, 1990) as described (McBryant et al., 1995). Truncated 5 S RNA molecules were obtained by transcription from synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides as described (McBryant et al., 1995). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by and purchased from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). A 55 nucleotide long RNA, comprising loop A, a random sequence tetraloop and the helix V, loop E, helix IV region of 5 S RNA was obtained by PCR ampli®cation with the following template and primers: template, 5H -GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCACACC NNNNGGGCCTGGT TAGTACCTGTTCGCTGGGAAATACCAGGTGCCC-3H ; 5H primer, 5H -GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCACACC-3H ; and 3H primer, 5H -GGGCACCTGGTATTCCC-3H . An EcoRI site and part of a SmaI site are underlined, respectively. These primers and template give rise to a 78 bp PCR product. Transcription with T7 RNA polymerase yields a 55 nucleotide-long RNA which was used for subsequent rounds of selection and ampli®ca-
