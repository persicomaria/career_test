To identify novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands that induce a novel architecture within the ligandbinding pocket (LBP), we have investigated eight 22-butyl-1R,24-dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivatives (3-10), all having a butyl group as the branched alkyl side chain. We found that the 22S-butyl-20-epi-25,26,27trinorvitamin D derivative 5 was a potent VDR agonist, whereas the corresponding compound 4 with the natural configuration at C(20) was a potent VDR antagonist. Analogues with the full vitamin D3 side chain were less potent agonist, and whether they were agonists or antagonists depended on the 24-configuration. X-ray crystal structures demonstrated that the VDR-LBD accommodating the potent agonist 5 has an architecture wherein the lower side and the helix 11 side of the LBP is simply expanded relative to the canonical active-VDR situation; in contrast, the potent antagonist 4 induces an extra cavity to accommodate the branched moiety. This is the first report of a VDR antagonist that generates a new cavity to alter the canonical pocket structure of the ligand occupied VDR.
Introduction The hormonally active metabolite of vitamin D3, 1R,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3, 1a], plays an important role in calcium homeostasis, cell differentiation and proliferation, and immunomodulation.1 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a) and its active analogues exert these effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDRa), which belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily.2 The VDR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that functions as a heterodimer with another nuclear receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR).3 Upon ligand binding, the VDR undergoes a conformational change that promotes RXR-VDR heterodimerization.3 The RXR-VDR heterodimer binds to the vitamin D response elements present in the promoter region of responsive genes, recruits the coactivator, and initiates the transcription. Since the first report of the X-ray crystal structure of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the VDR complexed with the hormone 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a) by Moras' group in 2000,4 several groups have solved the crystal structures of the VDR-LBD complexed with a variety of ligands.5-16 All of the crystal structures showed the canonical Moras' conformation of the VDR-LBD and quite similar architectures of the ligand binding pocket (LBP), except for the complex of zebrafish VDR-LBD with "GEMINI, 1b",7,11 an analogue with two identical side chains.17,18 The zebrafish VDR-LBD/GEMINI complex revealed the formation of a new channel extending the original LBP in order to accommodate the second side chain. This particular observation suggests that the region around helix 6,

the subsequent loop 6-7, and the N-terminal of helix 7 has a certain flexibility without loss of function because, despite the new pocket structure, GEMINI 1b acts as a VDR agonist.19 We considered that some new ligands having the right side chain might be able to change the induced pocket structure in such a way as to modulate the VDR differently. Here, we report a novel class of vitamin D analogues exhibiting a stereospecific dichotomy of activities. Design and Synthesis We have already reported that some 22-alkyl-1R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and in particular the 20-epi analogues, act as superagonists of the VDR.20-22 Docking analysis and alanine scanning mutational analysis (ASMA) gave a clue that the 22alkyl substituent of 22R-butyl-20-epi-1,25-(OH)2D3 2 might induce a novel cavity in a similar way to GEMINI 1b.22 To explore further vitamin D compounds possessing a 22-butyl group, we have now investigated a series of 22-butyl-1R,24dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivatives 3-10 as candidate VDR modulators. The 25-to-24 transposition of the hydroxyl group is a known agonistic modification, notably seen in several clinically important vitamin D analogues. In compounds 3-6, three carbons at the side chain terminus were removed to decrease the degree of hydrophobic interactions with helix 12, including the terminal of helix 11, of the VDR. On the basis of our previous study, we had concluded that insufficient hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the C-terminal of the VDR cause antagonistic behavior.23 Compounds 7-10 were designed as the counterparts of side chain truncated analogues 3 and 4 to test the significance of the hydrophobic interactions (Chart 1). As shown in Scheme 1, 22-butyl vitamin D derivatives 3 and 4 were synthesized from 22R-butyl compound 11 and 22S-butyl compound 12, respectively, which are the established products of a diastereofacial selective conjugate addition reaction of n-Bu2CuLi with the E- and Z-enoates developed by our group previously.24 The configuration at C(22) follows from the

stereochemistry of the starting enoates and the reaction conditions.24 Reduction of the side chain ester together with reductive cleavage of the carbonates at C(1) and C(3) as protecting groups of 11 and 12 gave provitamins D, 13 and 14, respectively. These provitamins were converted to the desired vitamin D analogues 3 and 4 by the biomimetic sequence of photoirradiation with a high-pressure mercury lamp, followed by thermal isomerization. The 20-epi-analogues 5 and 6 were synthesized by the analogous procedure as that described above for the synthesis of the 20normal analogues 3 and 4. 22-Butyl-1R,24-dihydroxyvitamins D3 7-10 were successfully synthesized from the same 22-butyl compounds 11 and 12. Controlled chemoselective reduction of the methyl esters of 11 and 12 by DIBAL afforded 24-alcohols 19 and 20, respectively. Swern oxidation of the 24-alcohols 19 and 20 gave the aldehyde 21 and 22, respectively. 22R-aldehyde 21 reacted with i-PrMgCl to give the 24R- and 24S-isomers 23 (less polar) and 24 (more polar), while 22S-aldehyde 22 reacted with i-PrMgCl to give the 24R- and 24S-isomers 25 (less polar) and 26 (more polar). Epimers were separated by column chromatography. The configuration at C24 was determined by the Kusumi-Mosher method (Scheme 2).25 Thus, less polar compound 23 was converted to the corresponding S- and R-MTPA esters of the 24-hydroxyl group (31 and 32), and the 22-isomer 26 was also converted to those of the 24-hydroxyl group (33 and 34). Chemical shift differences between the S-MTPA ester and the corresponding R-MTPA ester are shown

in Figure 1a,b. This analysis clearly indicated that the 24alcohols 23 and 26 have a 24R-configuration and a 24Sconfiguration, respectively. Consequently, the configurations of 24-isomers 24 and 25 were demonstrated to be S and R, respectively. Methyl carbonates at C(1) and C(3) were saponified to give provitamins D 27-30. These provitamins were converted to the desired vitamin D analogues 7-10 by photoirradiation, followed by thermal isomerization. Biological Activities Binding affinity for the VDR was evaluated by the standard competitive binding assay using bovine thymus VDR, which has a LBD amino acid sequence26 identical to that of the human VDR.27 The results are summarized in Table 1. Of the four 22-butyl-1R,24-dihydroxy-25,26,27-trinorvitamins D3 3-6, the 22S-compounds 4 and 5 showed significant affinity compared to the natural hormone 1a, while their 22R-isomers 3 and 6 showed weak affinity for the VDR. Among the four 22-butyl1R,24-dihydroxyvitamins D3 7-10, both of the 24S-hydroxyl compounds 8 and 10 showed significant affinity for the VDR, while both the 24R-hydroxyl compounds 7 and 9 showed relatively weak affinity. The ability of 22-butyl compounds 3-10 to induce transcription of a vitamin D-responsive gene was tested using the rat osteopontin luciferase reporter gene assay system in Cos7 cells, and the results are shown in Figure 2. In this assay, only

compound 5 showed full agonistic activity and two analogues 7 and 9 showed weak agonist activity. All of the others, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10, showed little activity. It is known that receptor

affinity and transactivation potency are not proportional to each other.22,28 The potency to inhibit VDR activation was evaluated in the presence of 1 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a). As shown in Figure 2, compounds 4, 6, 8, and 10 concentration-dependently inhibited the transactivation induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a), indicating that these four analogues work as VDR antagonists. We performed the same assays in HEK293 cells and obtained similar results (see Supporting Information Figure S1). We evaluated the expression of CYP24A1 mRNA in HEK293 cells by quantitative real-time PCR. CYP24A1 is known to be the most potent target gene of the hormone 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1).29a In accordance with the transcriptional activities of our synthetic ligands described above, only compound 5 expressed CYP24A1 mRNA strongly in comparison with the natural hormone 1a, and compound 9 showed weak expression activity (Figure 3a,b). All of the others, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10, showed little activity. The inhibition potency of synthetic ligands for CYP24A1 mRNA expression was evaluated in the presence of 10 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 (1a). As shown in Figure 3a,b, compounds 4, 6, 8, and 10 significantly inhibited the gene expression induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a). Figure 3c shows that compound 4 inhibited the gene expression concentration-dependently.

Cell differentiation and antiproliferation activity were evaluated using human promyelocyte HL-60 cells.29b Compound 5 showed significant activity for differentiation of HL-60 cells into monocytes/macrophages (Figure 4), being comparable to that of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a), whereas compound 9 showed weak activity. None of the other compounds induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Similar results were obtained in experiments examining the antiproliferative effect on HL-60 cells (data not shown). Ligand 4 concentration-dependently inhibited the differentiation and antiproliferation of HL-60 cells induced by stimulation with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a) (Figure 4c). Morphologic analysis also indicated that the differentiation of HL-60 cells was inhibited by ligand 4 (Figure 4d). Thus, in all assays, ligands 4 and 5 were demonstrated to behave as a potent antagonist and a potent agonist, respectively. Alanine Scanning Mutational Analysis We have developed and reported a method for exhaustive alanine scanning mutational analysis (ASMA) of residues lining the LBP of the VDR.30 We applied this analysis to all eight compounds 3-10. Transactivation was examined using 22-butyl compounds (3-10) at a concentration of 10-6 M. The results are shown in Figure S2 (see Supporting Information) in comparison with the natural hormone (1a) and the parent molecule, 22R-butyl-20-epi-1,25-(OH)2D3 2. Recruitment of RXR and Coactivator Peptide We evaluated ligand-dependent recruitment of the RXR and a coactivator peptide, SRC-1, to the VDR using a mammalian two-hybrid assay similar to that reported previously.31 As shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information, compound 5 recruited the RXR and SRC-1 strongly, whereas compounds 7 and 9 did so weakly. Inhibition of SRC-1 recruitment induced by natural hormone 1a was observed for compounds 4, 8, and 10 (data not shown). Structure To understand the molecular basis of action of our synthetic ligands, we conducted X-ray crystal structure analysis of the VDR-LBD/ligand complex and successfully solved the crystal structure of rat VDR-LBD bound to the potent agonist 5 in

the presence of the coactivator peptide at 2.1 Å resolution (Table 2). A ribbon-tube representation of the rVDR-LBD/5/peptide complex is shown in Figure 5a, and the results of the crystallographic refinement are summarized in Table 2. The electron density of the VDR-LBD complex including ligand 5 is well defined. The overall structure of the VDR-LBD is similar to that observed for VDR-LBD bound to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a),15 although the ligand 5 has a branched alkyl side chain. The coactivator peptide is tightly bound to the activation function 2 surface formed by helices 3, 4, and 12 of the LBD and occupies the typical agonist position (Figure 5a). However, the docking mode of agonist 5 is unusual. In the crystal structure, the part from the A-ring to the D-ring occupies almost the same position as that of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1a), but the mode in which the side chain is accommodated into the pocket is unique (Figure 5b), i.e., the 22-butyl group, and not the canonical side chain bearing the 24-hydroxyl group, is oriented toward helix 12, and the 24-hydroxyl group itself is oriented toward helix 6 to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the main chain of Val296 (hVal300) on helix 6. Because both of the side chains of ligand 5 are accommodated tightly in the pocket of the VDR active conformation, the pocket is slightly expanded in the bottom (lower) region, where the side chain hydroxyl group of 5 is located, and in the terminal region of helix 11, where the terminal of the butyl group of 5 is located together with a molecule. The expansion of the bottom region results from steric repulsion between the side chains of the residues on helix 6 and the subsequent loop 6-7 of the VDR and the 24-hydroxyl group of ligand 5. Expansion at the helix 11 side is caused by twisting of the side chain of Leu400 (hLeu404) on loop 11-12 (Figure 5b). To understand the structural basis of the antagonistic effect of compound 4, we attempted to solve the crystal structure of the VDR-LBD/4 complex. We were able to obtain crystals of the complex in the presence of the coactivator peptide, but not in its absence. The resolution of the ternary complex (rVDR-LBD/ 4/peptide) was 3.0 Å (Table 2). The electron density of the main chain of the VDR-LBD and almost all of ligand 4 was clearly observed. The overall structure of the main chain, including helices 11 and 12, is quite similar to that of the VDR-LBD/ 1a/peptide complex (Figure 6a). The main chains of only two

amino acid residues, Leu305 (hLeu309) and Ser394 (hSer398), are slightly twisted outward (Figure 6b). The crystal structure clearly demonstrated that a novel cavity is produced in the region surrounded by helix 6, the subsequent loop 6-7, the N-terminal of helix 7 and helix 11, as in the zVDR/GEMINI complex, because the terminal of the 22-butyl group of 4 pushes out the side chain of Leu305 to rearrange the LBP (Figure 6c,d). Thus, we identified a new class of VDR ligands with a simple side chain that modulate the structure of the LBP. Discussion Compound 5 was proved to have potent agonistic activity by additional experiments involving RXR recruitment and SRC-1 peptide recruitment using a mammalian two-hybrid assay (see

Supporting Information Figure S3). These experimental results corroborate the crystal structure of the VDR-LBD/5/peptide complex (Figure 5). Thus, the overall surface structure is rather similar to that of the VDR-LBD/1a/peptide complex. On the other hand, ligand 5 is accommodated into the LBP by an unusual docking mode in which two side chains of ligand 5, together with a molecule, increase the volume of the LBP. The pocket is filled sufficiently with ligand 5 and a water molecule. These observations well account for the potent activity of compound 5. The antagonistic activity of compound 4 was also confirmed by experiments involving RXR recruitment and SRC-1 peptide recruitment (see Supporting Information Figure S3). So far, the X-ray crystal structure of the VDR-LBD/antagonist complex, which clearly explains the structural basis of the antagonism,

has not been reported. Quite recently, the crystal structure of the VDR-LBD complex accommodating an antagonist with a coactivator peptide was reported, where the ligand was bound to the active (agonistic) conformation of the VDR.16 This situation was also the case in the present study. We were able to obtain crystals of the VDR-LBD/4 complex in the presence

of, but not in the absence of, the coactivator peptide as a ternary complex (Figure 6). Considering the action of compound 4 as a VDR antagonist, the active (agonistic) conformation of the VDR-LBD/4 complex bound tightly to the peptide seems to be a temporary and less preferred structure but selected in the course of crystallization. This idea is consistent with the fact

New Class of Vitamin D Analogues

that the resolution limit of this crystal (3.0 Å) is much lower than that of the crystal for compound 5 (2.1 Å). Therefore, the active conformation observed in our crystal structure may not exactly correspond to the predominant one in vivo. Meanwhile, it is true that ligand 4 modifies the pocket structure to induce a new cavity, as seen in the zVDR-LBD/GEMINI complex.11 Unlike GEMINI, however, compound 4 showed antagonistic activity. This discrimination can be explained mainly by the difference in hydrophobic interactions between the side chain terminals of the ligand and the C-terminal of the VDR. This explanation agrees with the fact that compound 9, which restored the three truncated carbons on the side chain, restored the agonistic activity, albeit weakly. Compound 6, which is 25,26,27-trinor analogue of the previously reported 22R-butyl-20-epi-1,25-(OH)2D3 2, having potent agonistic activity,22 showed weak VDR affinity and little agonistic or antagonistic activity. ASMA of compound 6 yielded results similar to those for 22R-butyl-20-epi-1,25-(OH)2D3 2, indicating that 6 is accommodated into the VDR-LBD by the similar docking mode to that of the parent compound 2. However, interaction of a hydrogen bond with His397 is not important for 6 because H397A did not decrease the transcriptional activity in comparison with the wild type. In addition, compound 6 lacks the intimate hydrophobic interactions with the C-terminal residues of the VDR because of truncation of the three carbons in the side chain terminal. Therefore, the weak activity of ligand 6 is attributable to poor interaction with the C-terminal regions (helix 11-helix 12) of the VDR. Docking analysis of ligand 8 into the crystal structure of the VDR-LBD/4/peptide complex demonstrated that the two side chains of ligand 8 occupy opposite cavities, respectively, (data not shown) in comparison with the VDR-LBD/4 complex. This mode is consistent with the results of ASMA. The increased activity of H397A and H305A compared with the wild type (Supporting Information Figure S2h) suggests that His397 does not form an important hydrogen bond with ligand 8 and His305 exhibits crucial steric repulsion from the ligand. Docking analysis of ligand 10 demonstrated that its mode of docking into the LBP is similar to that of compound 4. When taking together with the results of ASMA, it appears that steric repulsion between the i-propyl group of the side chain terminal of 10 and the side chain of His305 explains the antagonistic activity. GEMINI (1b), which has two identical side chains branching at C(20), induces structural rearrangement of the LBP.11 We identified potent agonist 5 and potent antagonist 4, both of which have a branched 22S-butyl group and are isomers at C(20). We found that both ligands rearrange the pocket structure of the VDR through an unusual docking mode that has not yet been reported. Other ligands (3, 6-10) showed intermediate activities (weakly agonistic and weakly antagonistic) and appeared to modify the LBP structure moderately. It is interesting that although GEMINI (1b) and our compound 4 are accommodated into the VDR-LBD through a similar docking mode, GEMINI (1b) works as a VDR agonist whereas compound 4 works as a VDR antagonist. Conclusions We synthesized 22-butyl-1,24-(OH)2D3 derivatives 3-10 and evaluated their biological activities. Four compounds, 4, 5, 8, and 10, showed significant VDR binding affinity but three of them, 4, 8, and 10, showed little transactivation, cell differentiation, and CYP24A1 gene expression potency. Instead, these three compounds concentration-dependently inhibited biological activities induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3, indicating that they are VDR

antagonists. On the basis of X-ray crystallographic analysis, we identified a new class of ligands that modulate the pocket structure of the VDR. This is the first report of a VDR antagonist that generates a new cavity to alter the pocket structure of the VDR, opening an interesting new perspective of ligand design based on the alternative structural basis of VDR agonism and antagonism.

Competitive Binding Assay, Bovine Thymus VDR. Binding to bovine thymus VDR was evaluated according to the procedure reported.20 Bovine thymus VDR was purchased from Yamasa Biochemical (Choshi, Chiba, Japan) and dissolved in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.3 M KCl and 5 mM dithiothreitol just before use. The receptor solution (500 µL) in an assay tube was incubated with 0.072 nM [3H]-1,25-(OH)2D3 together with graded amounts of each vitamin D analogue (0.001-20 nM) or vehicle for 19 h at 4 °C. The bound and free [3H]-1,25-(OH)2D3 were separated by treating with dextran-coated charcoal for 20 min at 4 °C. The assay tubes were centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min. The radioactivity of the supernatant was counted. Nonspecific binding was subtracted. These experiments were done in duplicate. Transfection and Transactivation Assay. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were seeded on 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 per well. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid containing three copies of the mouse osteopontin VDRE (5-GGTTCAcgaGGTTCA, SPPx3-TK-Luc), a wild-type or mutant hVDR expression plasmid (pCMX-hVDR), and the internal control plasmid containing sea pansy luciferase expression constructs (pRL-CMV) by the lipofection method as described previously.32 After 8 h of incubation, the cells were treated with either the ligand or ethanol vehicle and cultured for 16 h. Cells in each well were harvested with a cell lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Wisconsin). Transactivation measured by the luciferase activity was normalized with the internal control. All experiments were done in triplicate. Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR Analysis. Total RNAs from samples were prepared with RNAgents Total RNA Isolation system (Promega), and cDNAs were synthesized using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed on the ABI PRISM 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix -Plus- (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Primers were as follows: CYP24A1, 5-TGA ACG TTG GCT TCA GGA GAA-3 and 5-AGG GTG CCT GAG TGT AGC ATC T-3; actin, 5-GAC AGG ATG CAG AAG GAG AT-3 and 5-GAA GCA TTT GCG GTG GAC GAT-3. The RNA values were normalized to the level of Actin mRNA and represent the mean ( SD of triplicate assays. Differentiation of HL-60 Cells. Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were plated at 2 × 105 cells/plate and were cultured in Eagle's modified medium as described previously.33 The cells were incubated with each vitamin D compound (10-6, 10-7 and 10-8 M) for 4 days. The differentiation activity was determined by

an NBT reduction assay method as previously reported.33,34 The experiments were done in duplicate. X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of the Complex Structure. In this study, the method reported by Vanhooke et al.6 was used with some modifications to prepare the crystals of VDR complexes. The rat VDR-LBD (residues 116-423, 165-211) was cloned as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein into the pET14b expression vector and overproduced in Escherichia coli C41. The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (including ampicilin 100 mg/L) and subsequently induced for 6 h with 15 µM isopropyl- D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 23 °C. The purification procedure included affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column, followed by dialysis and cation-exchange chromatography (SP-Sepharose). After tag removal by thrombin digestion, protease was removed by filtration through a HiTrap benzamidine column and the protein was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex200 column. The purity and homogeneity of the rVDR-LBD were assessed by SDS-PAGE. Purified rVDR-LBD solution was concentrated to about 0.75 mg/mL by ultrafiltration. To an aliquot (800 µL) of the protein solution was added a ligand (ca. 10 equiv), the solution was further concentrated to about 1/8, and then a solution (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 50 mM NaCl; 10 mM DTT; 0.02% NaN3) of coactivator peptide (H2N-KNHPMLMNLLKDN-CONH2) derived from DRIP205 was added. This solution of VDR/ligand/peptide was allowed to crystallize by the vapor diffusion method using a series of precipitant solutions containing 0.1 M MOPS-NaOH (pH7.0), 0.1-0.4 M sodium formate, 12-22% (w/v) PEG4000, and 5% (v/ v) ethylene glycol. Droplets for crystallization were prepared by mixing 2 µL of complex solution and 1 µL precipitant solution, and droplets were equilibrated against 500 µL precipitant solution at 20 °C. It took 1-2 days to obtain reproducible crystals with X-ray diffraction quality for VDR complex with the ligand 5. On the other hand, the VDR complex with the ligand 4 gave only crystals of poor quality except the one used for the structure determination, which was barely suitable for X-ray diffraction experiment. Prior to diffraction data collection, crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 0.1 M MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.1-0.4 M sodium formate, 15-20% PEG4000, and 17-20% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data sets were collected at 100 K in a stream of nitrogen gas at beamline BL-6A of KEK-PF (Tsukuba, Japan). Reflections were recorded with an oscillation range per image of 1.0°. Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the program HKL2000.35 The structures of complex were solved by molecular replacement with the program CNS36 using a rat VDR-LBD coordinates (PDB code: 1RK3), and finalized sets of atomic coordinates were obtained after iterative rounds of model modification with the program XtalView37 and refinement with CNS by rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, positional minimization, water molecule identification, and individual isotropic B-value refinement. The coordinates of the two complexes were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 2ZXM for ligand 4 and 2ZXN for ligand 5. Graphical Manipulations and Ligand Docking. Graphical manipulations were performed using SYBYL 8.0 (Tripos, St. Louis). The atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of zVDR-LBD complexed with GEMINI (1b) were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB) (entry 2HCD).11 22-Butyl vitamin D analogues (3, 6, 7-10) were docked into the ligand-binding pocket using Surflex Dock 2.0 (Tripos, St. Louis), and then the docking models were modified to agree with the biological activities.
