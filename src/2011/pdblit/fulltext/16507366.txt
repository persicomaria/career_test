Transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) controls cellular adaptation to oxidants and electrophiles by inducing antioxidant and detoxification genes in response to redox stress. NRF2 is negatively regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). Tumours from $15% of patients with lung cancer harbour somatic mutations in KEAP1 that prevent effective NRF2 repression. Recently, two NRF2 mutation `hot-spots' were identified in $10% of patients with lung cancer, enabling the transcription factor to evade KEAP1-mediated repression. Somatic mutations in KEAP1 and NRF2 provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms by which NRF2 is regulated. Moreover, constitutive NRF2 activation might cause drug resistance in tumours, and an understanding of how the transcription factor is regulated indicates ways in which this could be overcome. NRF2 function and regulation in normal cells The ability of cells to adapt rapidly to changes in their environment is essential for survival. In mammalian cells, the transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) enables adaptation to oxidants and electrophiles by stimulating the transcriptional activation of $100 cytoprotective genes. Considerable progress has been made recently in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which NRF2 activity is normally restrained under homeostatic conditions, and how oxidants and electrophilic compounds overcome this restraint. As expected, examination of transgenic knockout mice has revealed that targeted disruption of Nrf2 is associated with a marked increased susceptibility to the genotoxic, cytotoxic and inflammatory effects of many environmental stressors. Cellular adaptation to redox stress Human cells are continuously threatened by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by carbonyls, epoxides and lipid hydroperoxides produced as secondary metabolites from ROS-mediated damage to intracellular macromolecules [1]. Also, we are intermittently exposed to harmful exogenous agents including UV irradiation, cigarette smoke and other combustion products, carcinogenic environmental pollutants, pyrolysis products in cooked food, mycotoxins, and bacterial and viral infections [2].

chemical nature of these environmental factors, and the uncertain periodicity of these challenges, evolution has equipped mammalian cells with several adaptive mechanisms that enable them to endure acute exposure to such agents. One of the most versatile mechanisms of adaptation involves NRF2, a cap'n' collar (CNC) basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor [3]. Its activity increases in response to ROS and electrophilic chemicals that have the ability to modify intracellular thiols, including reduced glutathione (GSH). Upon challenge with agents that produce oxidative stress, NRF2 protein levels rapidly increase in the nucleus of affected cells, triggering the transactivation of a battery of cytoprotective genes, each containing at least one antioxidant response element (ARE; 50 -A/GTGAC/GNNNGCA/G-30 ) in their promoters [4,5]. NRF2 target genes include those encoding antioxidant proteins, enzymes involved in NADPH regeneration, drug-metabolising enzymes, drug-efflux pumps, heat shock proteins, a- and b-subunits of the 26S proteasome, growth factors, growth factor receptors, and various transcription factors [6­23] (Table 1). Perhaps most importantly in the context of the response to redox stress, NRF2 tightly regulates GSH through its ability to control the expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) and modifier (GCLM) subunits; GCLC and GCLM combine to form a heterodimer which catalyses the rate-limiting step in GSH biosynthesis. Increased GSH production augments the capacity of cells to scavenge ROS. NRF2 also regulates the production of glutathione reductase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, peroxiredoxin and sulfiredoxin, and therefore has the ability to restore oxidized intracellular thiols to their reduced state upon its activation. In addition, NRF2 controls the expression of proteins such as ferritin, which blocks the formation of free radicals via the Fenton reaction [1], and also the expression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which inhibits the formation of free radicals by the redox-cycling of quinones [24]. Besides reducing thiols and preventing the generation of free radicals, NRF2mediated induction of drug-metabolising enzymes and drug-efflux pumps enables the detoxification of many compounds containing a,b-unsaturated carbonyl, epoxide, halide, hydroperoxide and quinone moieties, and the removal of their inactive conjugated metabolites from cells [2]. Thus, the concerted upregulation of ARE-driven genes enables adaptation to increased concentrations of ROS,

reactive nitrogen species, and numerous electrophilic compounds. The importance of NRF2 in providing protection against environmental hazards has been elegantly demonstrated by the finding that resistance to hyperoxia (i.e. >95% O2) in inbred C57BL/6 and C3H mice segregated with the Nrf2 locus upon cross-breading [25]. Subsequent studies in Nrf2À/À mice confirmed that the CNC­bZIP factor conferred resistance against hyperoxia [26]. More recent studies have shown that Nrf2À/À mice are more susceptible to pulmonary damage and various forms of chronic lung

disease produced by exposure to cigarette smoke [27]. Importantly, NRF2 can protect against the formation of DNA adducts or mutations produced by aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene and diesel exhaust fumes [28­31]. Additionally, it can inhibit apoptosis caused by oxidants or Fas ligand [15,32,33]. Contribution of NRF2 to cancer chemoprevention Because NRF2 can mediate the induction of ARE-driven genes encoding enzymes that inactivate genotoxic electrophiles, it is probably not surprising that many compounds

that activate this transcription factor are able to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis (for reviews, see Refs [24,27,34]). Such compounds are called cancer chemopreventive agents and include butylated hydroxyanisole, coumarin, circumin, diallyl sulfide, dithiolethiones, ethoxyquin and isothiocyanates. In Nrf2À/À mice, induction of ARE-driven genes by chemopreventive agents is almost entirely abolished [6,34]. The mutant mice are more sensitive to chemical carcinogenesis and cannot be protected against development of tumours by chemopreventive agents [35,36]. Negative control of NRF2 by KEAP1 Mouse and human NRF2 proteins contain 597 and 605 amino acids, respectively. They can be divided into six domains, called Neh1­6 (Figure 1a), based on regions of sequence homology shared between mammalian NRF2 proteins and the chicken orthologue, called ECH [37]. The Neh1 domain contains a bZIP region fused to a CNC region and is responsible for both its ability to dimerize with small MAF proteins (named for the avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene) and its ability to bind DNA as an obligate heterodimer. This domain is also found in NF-E2 p45, NRF1 and NRF3 [38]. The N-terminal Neh2 domain is required for redox-sensitive negative control of the CNC­ bZIP factor [39]. The C-terminal Neh3 domain interacts with chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 6 (CHD6) and therefore might associate with the transcriptional apparatus [40]. Both Neh4 and Neh5 are transactivation domains that interact with CREB-binding protein (CBP) [41]. The central Neh6 domain contributes to redox-independent negative control of NRF2 [42]. The Neh2 domain negatively controls NRF2 through its ability to interact with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). Mammalian KEAP1 proteins typically comprise 624 amino acids. They are metalloproteins that contain a ` Broad-complex, Tramtrack, Bric-a-brac (BTB) dimerization domain, an intervening region (IVR) enriched with Cys residues, and a domain comprising six Kelch repeats that represents a protein docking site [39,43­46] (Figure 1b); the IVR has also been called a BTB and C-terminal Kelch (BACK) domain because it is conserved in many BTB-Kelch

proteins [47]. Most importantly, mouse and human KEAP1 proteins contain 25 and 27 cysteines, respectively, of which approximately half are likely to be highly reactive because they are situated beside basic amino acids; therefore, the pKa of their thiol group will be substantially reduced, enabling formation of the thiolate anion under normal physiological conditions [48]. The discovery of KEAP1 prompted the prediction that it could function as an intracellular redox sensor because it contains reactive cysteines that might either form adducts with electrophiles or be readily oxidized. Whereas mouse Keap1 contains 25 cysteines and human KEAP1 contains 27 cysteines, only the conserved Cys23, Cys151, Cys273 and Cys288 residues have been implicated functionally in its activity. Forced expression of recombinant KEAP1 in various cell lines has shown that mutants lacking Cys23, Cys273 and Cys288 are unable to negatively regulate NRF2 [49­52]. Similar transfection experiments revealed that a KEAP1 point mutant in which Cys151 was changed to Ser irreversibly repressed NRF2, such that AREdriven gene expression was low and could not be induced upon treatment with redox stressors [49]. In transgenic complementation rescue experiments, Keap1C273A and/or Keap1C288A mutants were unable to repress constitutive overexpression of ARE-driven genes, whereas knock-in of Keap1C151S into Keap1À/À mice restored low basal expression of ARE-driven genes in vivo [53]. The notion that KEAP1 contains reactive cysteines has been supported by the demonstration that KEAP1 can be modified in vitro and ex vivo by electrophilic xenobiotics including dexamethasone 21-mesylate, biotinylated iodoacetamide, 1-biotinamido-4-(40 -[maleimidoethyl-cyclohexane]-carboxamido)butane (BMCC),1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2, 4-hydroxynonenal and sulforaphane [54­59]. One hypothesis is that modification of Cys residues in KEAP1 triggers a conformational change that influences its interaction with NRF2. Initially, yeast two-hybrid experiments identified mouse Keap1 as a negative regulator of chicken NRF2 (i.e. ECH) [39]. The hypothesis that Keap1 negatively controls Nrf2 was confirmed in vivo by the generation of Keap1 knockout

mice [60]. P10 livers from Keap1À/À mice contained higher levels of Nrf2 protein than did their wild-type counterparts, and also overexpressed Nqo1, class Mu glutathione S-transferase (Gstm1) and class Pi Gstp1 [60]. Moreover, KEAP1 knockdown experiments in non-transformed HaCaT keratinocytes showed that the hypothesis is relevant to man [61]. Consequences of Keap1 knockout in the mouse Global knockout of mouse Keap1 led to postnatal death at the time the animals were weaned. This did not seem to be caused by overexpression of prototypic members of the ARE-gene battery, such as those listed in Table 1. Rather, it was attributed to hyperkeratosis of the oesophagus and forestomach as a consequence of Nrf2-mediated overexpression of keratins K1 and K6, and loricrin [60]. Because Keap1À/À mice did not live beyond 21 days, it is not known if the hyperkeratosis is simply a postnatal developmental problem and would not happen if Nrf2 were permanently activated later in life. The relevance of the finding that Keap1À/À mice suffer hyperkeratosis for human health is difficult to evaluate at present because it is not known whether keratin and loricrin genes are regulated by NRF2 in man. Specifically, Gasper et al. [62] found that consumption of glucosinolateenriched broccoli by human volunteers induced antioxidant and detoxification genes in gastric mucosa, but these investigators presented no evidence that keratin genes were induced. It seems likely that NRF2­KEAP1 activity varies in different tissues. For example, liver-specific Keap1 knockout in the mouse at an early stage after birth does not seem to have an adverse effect. Indeed, it confers protection against poisoning by the analgesic acetaminophen [19] and also against the inflammatory effects of concanavalin A [23]. It therefore seems that in certain mouse organs, constitutive activation of Nrf2 can have cytoprotective beneficial effects. Nature of the interaction between NRF2 and KEAP1 Reverse two-hybrid screening experiments showed that an ETGE motif (residues 79­82) in the mouse Nrf2 Neh2 domain can engage in a high-affinity interaction with the Keap1 Kelch-repeat domain [63]. Co-crystallography of the Kelch-repeat domain with an ETGE-containing peptide from Neh2 showed that the acidic peptide 75 QLDEETGEFL84 in NRF2 forms a tight b-turn hairpin conformation that participates in a high-affinity interaction with multiple basic amino acids (Arg380, Arg415, His436, Arg483), as well as polar residues (Tyr334, Ser363, Asn382, Ser508, Tyr525, Ser555, Tyr572) located at the bottom surface of the mouse and human KEAP1 Kelchrepeat domain [64,65]. Each residue in KEAP1 that participates in binding the ETGE peptide is located either within the loop immediately preceding b-strand 1 in Kelchrepeats 2, 3, 5 and 6 or within the loop between b-strand 2 and b-strand 3 in Kelch-repeats 1, 2, 3 and 4 [45,64,65]. After the identification of the high-affinity ETGE motif in the NRF2 Neh2 domain, a second low-affinity binding site for KEAP1 was discovered, called the DLG motif (residues 29­31) [66]. Crystallography of the Kelch-repeat domain complexed with peptides that encompassed the

DLG motif revealed that 24WRQDID29 in NRF2 interacted with the KEAP1 Kelch-repeat domain in a similar way to the ETGE motif, with Gln26, Asp27 and Asp29 being bound in a manner that closely resembled that of Glu79, Thr80 and Glu82 [67]. However, the DLG peptide formed fewer electrostatic interactions with the Kelch-repeat domain than did the ETGE peptide and, presumably, this accounts for the difference in binding affinities of the two sequences within Neh2 for KEAP1 [67]. It is interesting to note that KEAP1 has been reported to bind several other proteins besides NRF2. These include fetal Alz-50 clone 1, prothymosin a, and the phosphoglycerate mutase family member PGAM5 [68­70]. In the case of PGAM5, the sequence ESGE exists between amino acid 79 and 82, and this has been identified as a possible highaffinity KEAP1-binding site [71]. Similar sequences have not however been found in fetal Alz-50 clone 1 or prothymosin a. Models to explain NRF2 repression by KEAP1 The following five models have been proposed to account for NRF2 nuclear accumulation and the accompanying gene induction that occurs upon redox stress. It should be recognized that the models are not necessarily mutually exclusive because distinct mechanisms might operate under different physiological settings. Model 1: NRF2 release from cytoplasmic anchoring This model proposes that under normal homeostatic conditions, NRF2 is retained in the cytoplasm through its interaction with KEAP1. During redox stress, however, NRF2 is released from KEAP1, whereupon the CNC­bZIP protein translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [39]. The cytoplasmic anchoring model is underpinned by the notion that KEAP1 is physically associated with the cytoskeleton through its ability to bind actin [72]. An alternative possibility is that KEAP1 might physically associate with mitochondria through its ability to bind PGAM5 [71]. Thus, NRF2 might be released from sites of tethering at the cytoskeleton or mitochondria in response to electrophiles or oxidants. Variants of the cytoplasmic anchoring model indicate that besides modification of Cys residues in KEAP1, PKC-mediated NRF2 phosphorylation at Ser40 facilitates its release from KEAP1 [73]. In a similar vein, casein kinase 2 (CK2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), ERK5, glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), PKR-like ER-localized eIF2a kinase (PERK) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) have been proposed to control NRF2 nuclear translocation and/or activity, but the sites phosphorylated by these kinases have not been identified [74­81]. Model 2: NRF2 release from nuclear sequestration and recruitment to ARE enhancers Some researchers have proposed that KEAP1 is not restricted to the cytoplasm, but rather can undergo nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. Although it is uncertain how KEAP1 gains access to the nucleus, it contains a potential nuclear export signal (NES), 301LVQIFQELTL310, in its IVR domain [69,82,83]. According to one nuclear sequestration model, KEAP1 retains NRF2
179

Review
in a sub-nuclear compartment under normal homeostatic conditions and thus prevents it from gaining access to ARE sequences in gene promoters. Upon stress stimulation however, the nuclear protein prothymosin a binds the Kelch-repeat domain and in so doing, liberates NRF2, enabling the CNC­bZIP factor to activate its target genes [69]. A variant of this model proposes that KEAP1 and NRF2 form a complex in the nucleoplasm that is exported to the cytoplasm, thereby preventing NRF2 from accumulating in the nucleus [83]. Of note, however, studies using purified monoclonal antibodies have provided evidence that the BTB­Kelch protein is predominantly located in the cytoplasm [84]. Thus, although the rate at which KEAP1 can facilitate NRF2 export from the nucleus is a potentially important point of regulation, it is possibly not a major pathway under non-stressed conditions. Model 3: NRF2 protein stabilization This model indicates that under normal homeostatic conditions, NRF2 is continuously degraded by the 26S proteasome in a KEAP1-dependent fashion [85]. Specifically, in addition to binding NRF2 through its Kelch-repeat domain, KEAP1 also binds Cullin-3 (Cul3) [86­89]; there is some controversy as to whether or not KEAP1 recruits Cul3 to its BTB domain or its IVR, but the former seems most likely because Cul3 binds other BTB proteins [90]. In turn, Cul3 binds ring-box 1 (Rbx1, also called Roc1) to form a core E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is envisaged to target NRF2 for degradation in a redox-dependent fashion. Of late, this model has been refined to accommodate the existence of two distinct binding sites in the NRF2 Neh2 domain for the Kelch-repeat domain [66]. Thus, the current model assumes that each of the two Kelch-repeat domains in dimeric KEAP1 bind NRF2 separately via either the DLG or ETGE motifs in Neh2. It has been postulated that KEAP1 immobilizes these ubiquitin acceptor sites by tethering NRF2 across the two Kelch-repeat domains, bringing them into close proximity to Cul3­Rbx1, and in an orientation that facilitates ubiquitylation [66,67] (Figure 2). Because the ETGE motif has a higher affinity than the DLG motif for the Kelch-repeat domain, a sequential interaction process has been proposed wherein dimeric KEAP1 captures NRF2 first through the ETGE motif before the DLG motif docks onto the adjacent unoccupied Kelch-repeat domain; this has been called a `hinge and latch' mechanism [67]. This model does not necessarily entail release of NRF2 by the KEAP1 dimer, but it does favour the idea that the low-affinity interaction between DLG and the Kelch-repeat domain is prevented as a consequence of dimeric KEAP1 adopting a conformation that alters the relative steric positions of the two Kelch-repeat domains. In this context, it is noteworthy that several groups have been unable to demonstrate release of NRF2 by KEAP1 after treatment with electrophiles [58,66]. It is thought that non-ubiquitylated NRF2 remains bound to the KEAP1­Cul3­Rbx1 complex after redox-stress-induced KEAP1 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor activity inhibition, that is, until KEAP1 regains its substrate adaptor activity. In this case, newly translated NRF2 protein would bypass the KEAP1­

The cartoon shows the two-site interaction between the NRF2 DLG (blue) and ETGE (green) motifs and two separate Kelch-repeat domains (orange) found in dimeric KEAP1 [66]. Note that the Lys residues that are ubiquitylated by Cul3­Rbx1 (depicted in shades of green) lie between the DLG and ETGE motifs.

Cul3­Rbx1 complex and accumulate rapidly in the nucleus [51]. The KEAP1­Cul3­Rbx1 complex is probably dynamic, undergoing cycles of assembly and disassembly through a process in which the ubiquitin ligase exists in either an active or an inactive state [91]. Based on data from Cul1, the recycling of cullin-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligases between the active and inactive state involves neddylation and deneddylation of cullin protein [92]. In its neddylated state, Cul1 binds its Skp1ÀF-box substrate adaptor and releases cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1). However, upon its deneddylation, Cul1 releases the Skp1ÀF-box protein and binds CAND1 [92]. Thus, in a repetitive manner, multiple cycles of substrate adaptor exchange with the core complex to ensure efficient ubiquitylation and destruction of target proteins. This dynamic exchange process seems to be relevant to KEAP1 because CAND1 knockdown diminishes the ability of KEAP1 to target NRF2 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Therefore, the rate at which KEAP1 recycles in the Cul3­Rbx1 complex represents another potential point at which the rate of NRF2 ubiquitylation and degradation might be regulated [91]. Several other variants of the NRF2 stabilization model exist. It is possible that redox-dependent modification of Cys residues in KEAP1 can trigger its ubiquitylation rather than that of NRF2 [56,93]; indeed, KEAP1 has been reported to be ubiquitylated and degraded after treatment with certain xenobiotics. In another version of this model, the association between KEAP1 and Cul3 is redox-sensitive, and the two proteins dissociate upon modification of certain Cys residues [94]. Lastly, a single report describes

Review
that the Parkinson's-disease-associated DJ-1 protein is necessary to stabilize NRF2; however, the molecular details of its interaction with either KEAP1 or NRF2 are unknown [95]. Most research that champions the model in which KEAP1 targets NRF2 for proteasomal degradation regards such activity as occurring in the cytoplasm [83]. It should, however, be noted that KEAP1-mediated NRF2 ubiquitylation has been reported to occur in the nucleus [82] and therefore the system might be more flexible than is currently recognized. Model 4: Antagonism of NRF2 nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling This model includes several KEAP1-independent mechanisms by which NRF2 is regulated via redox stress. It proposes that, under normal homeostatic conditions, NRF2 nuclear abundance is restricted because it undergoes redox-dependent nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. This process is controlled through the presence of a single nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and two NES motifs in the transcription factor. Specifically, NRF2 contains an NLS in its basic-region within Neh1, along with an NES in its Neh5 domain, and another in its leucine-zipper region within Neh1. The NES in the Neh5 domain, 175LLSIPELQCLNI186, contains an embedded cysteine, and it has been proposed that modification of this residue by oxidants or electrophiles prevents recognition of the motif by exportin 1, thus leading to its nuclear accumulation [96]. The NES in the bZIP domain (545LKRRLSTLYL554) lies close to Tyr568, which is apparently constitutively phosphorylated by Fyn. Failure to phosphorylate Tyr568 during oxidative stress, for example when GSK-3b is inactivated, might prevent exportin-1-mediated NRF2 nuclear export [97]. Model 5: NRF2 gene induction The Nrf2 promoter contains two ARE sequences [11] and also xenobiotic response elements (XREs) [98]. Consistent with the presence of an ARE in its gene promoter, Nrf2 mRNA is increased in mouse keratinocytes by 3H-1,2dithiole-3-thione treatment [11]. It is also modestly increased by the isothiocyanate sulforaphane [85]. Consistent with the presence of an XRE, Nrf2 protein and mRNA was increased in mouse hepatoma 1c1c7 cells after treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [98]. Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms exist in the promoter of human NRF2, and one of these (À617 C/A) significantly reduces gene expression [99]. It is not known whether such polymorphisms prevent the variant allele from being transcriptionally activated by thiol-active agents. Constitutive NRF2 upregulation in tumour cells There exists a poorly understood, but incontrovertible, dichotomy with respect to the role(s) of the ARE-gene battery in cancer chemoprevention and in resistance of tumour cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Many members of this gene battery that are induced in mice and rats by chemopreventive agents, such as GST isoenzymes, are also overexpressed in hepatic pre-neoplastic nodules [100,101].

Moreover, tumour cell lines with acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs often contain abundant GSH levels, and this is accompanied by upregulation of various drug-metabolising enzymes and drug-efflux pumps [102­ 105]. We now know, primarily from work in the mouse, that upregulation of GSH-dependent enzymes by cancer chemopreventive agents is mediated by NRF2 [6]. Furthermore, class Pi GST overexpression in rat liver preneoplastic nodules has been reported to result from NRF2 activation and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein a downregulation [106]. Many years ago, it was suggested that upregulation of GSH-dependent enzymes in drugresistant tumour cells could stem from the constitutive activation of a normal stress response [101]. It now seems that somatic mutations causing dys-regulation of the KEAP1­NRF2 pathway represent one example of the permanent activation of a stress response in cancer cells. Somatic mutations in KEAP1: their molecular importance in NRF2 repression An increasing body of evidence indicates that certain types of tumour might constitutively activate NRF2 through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms as a means of increasing their survival or proliferation. Initial reports uncovered KEAP1 mis-sense mutations in the H1184 and H1648 lung cancer cell lines that resulted in loss of NRF2 repression [64]. Shortly thereafter, mis-sense mutations, insertions and deletions were identified in KEAP1 from the tumours of ten of 54 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and in six of 12 cell lines [107]. These changes were due to somatic mutations rather than germ line mutations, because unaffected tissue from the patients contained wild-type KEAP1. Importantly, the mutations were reported to result in permanent NRF2 activation. Furthermore, KEAP1 mutation was frequently accompanied by loss of heterozygosity at the gene locus, thereby indicating that biallelic KEAP1 loss is common in NSCLC. Further KEAP1 mutations were later identified in additional lung cancer patients; one of eight with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), three of 29 with adenocarcinoma and one of two with large cell carcinoma were affected [108]. Mutations have also been reported in patients with neoplastic disease of the biliary tract; four of 13 patients with gall bladder cancer harboured KEAP1 mutations [109]. A single study reported that the human Q293 breast cancer cell line contains an inactive KEAP1 protein [52]. Taken together, these results indicate that KEAP1 can be rendered inactive through somatic mutations in several tumour types besides lung cancer. A wide variety of somatic KEAP1 mutations have been reported to date (Table 2). These mutant proteins have not all been tested individually, but it is believed that they all result in the inactivation of KEAP1. In view of the hypothesis that Cys273 and Cys288 in the IVR domain are important for KEAP1 repressor function, it is surprising that mutations in neither of these residues have been observed. However, a Cys to Tyr substitution at amino acid 23 was reported in the breast cancer Q293 cells that resulted in the KEAP1C23Y mutant having an impaired ability to repress NRF2; the reason Cys23 is essential for KEAP1 activity is not known [52].

a Human KEAP1 comprises 624 amino acids. This Table lists residues that are altered in tumour samples and cell lines compiled from Refs [64,107­109]. Amino acids marked with an asterisk are part of the -R-(x)6-V-(x)5-Y-(x)2-G-G-(x)9-14-E/D-(x)1-Y-(x)6-W- consensus sequence found in all blades that comprise the Kelch-repeat domain [45]. b Abbreviations: BTC, biliary tract cancer; KR, Kelch-repeat; b1, first b-strand within b-sheet; b2, second b-strand within b-sheet; b3, third b-strand within b-sheet; b4, fourth bstrand within b-sheet.

amino acid 249 has been noted in one of the gall bladder cancer patient samples [108], but a conservative mutation of this residue in transfection experiments provided no evidence it was essential for NRF2 repression. In H2126 cells, the introduction of an additional cysteine adjacent to Cys273 resulted in loss of KEAP1 function. It is currently unknown if KEAP1 inactivation is due to the mutant Cys272 forming an intra-subunit disulfide bridge with Cys273, and if so, whether this might interfere with the putative inter-subunit disulfide bridge between Cys273 and Cys288 [50], or whether the additional Cys residue interfered with the Zn2+ binding, thus possibly influencing KEAP1 structural integrity [46]. As mentioned earlier, the KEAP1 Kelch-repeat domain, in conjunction with the CTR, forms a six-bladed b-propeller docking site for the DLG and ETGE peptides. Support for the hypothesis that basic residues in KEAP1 are essential for binding DLG and ETGE peptides comes from the finding that Arg415 in the third Kelch-repeat, which is predicted to interact with NRF2 Glu79, was substituted with Gly in one of the lung cancer patients [108]. Furthermore, in H1435 and H1648 cells, substitutions are present in Arg413 and Gly364, which are situated adjacent to Arg415 and Ser363 that form hydrogen bonds with Glu79 and Glu82, respectively, in NRF2 [64,65]. It therefore seems that residues in KEAP1 that are adjacent to those forming hydrogen bonds with the ETGE peptide can disturb interactions between the two proteins. A substantial number of the mutations within the KEAP1 Kelch-repeat domain were directed against the
182

`double-glycine motif' located to the C-terminal side of the b-strand 2 in each of the Kelch-repeats. This glycine dipeptide is part of a conserved -R-(x)6-V-(x)5-Y-(x)2-G-G(x)9­14-E/D-(x)1-Y-(x)6-W- consensus sequence found within each blade of the b-propeller [45] (Box 1), and mutations were observed in it within Kelch-repeats 1, 2, 3 and 4. It is noteworthy that the conserved tyrosine in b-strand 3 undergoes substitution in lung cancer H838 cells. These results therefore indicate that the b-propeller formed by the KEAP1 Kelch-repeat domain can be disturbed easily by substitutions across the entire blade structure. The `two-site tethering' mechanism (model 3) requires both KEAP1 subunits in the dimeric substrate adaptor to be capable of binding NRF2. If this model is correct, it seems probable that tumours that are heterozygous KEAP1 point mutants would show substantially greater impairment in NRF2 repression than would occur if KEAP1 did not bind NRF2 through two sites; formation of a heterodimer between a wild-type KEAP1 subunit and a mutant KEAP1 subunit would be inactive if NRF2 could not be tethered through both its DLG and ETGE motifs. This is an area that warrants further study. Epigenetic changes in tumours can downregulate KEAP1 While discussing KEAP1 function, it should be mentioned that several lung tumours and the lung A549, H460 and SPC-A1 lung cell lines express little or no KEAP1 mRNA [110]. This loss of expression was attributed to hypermethylation of CpG sites in the KEAP1 promoter; accord-

Box 1. Structure of the KEAP1 Kelch-repeat domain
Kelch-repeat proteins form multi-blade b-propeller structures [43]. Each Kelch-repeat forms a blade with a twisted b-sheet fold that comprises four anti-parallel b-strands. At a primary structural level, the defining characteristics of the second b-sheet blade found within AFKin, Kelch, tealp, b-scruin, HCF1 and galactose oxidase is that they contain four hydrophobic residues immediately preceding a conserved `doubleglycine motif' in b-strand 2, a conserved tyrosine within b-strand 3, and a conserved tryptophan within b-strand 4. This observation enabled Adams et al. [43] to propose that -Y/L/F-(x)2-G-G-(x)12­19-Y-(x)6-Wconstitutes a consensus sequence for Kelch-repeat proteins. The six blades in human KEAP1 are formed by residues 327­609, with the propeller structure being closed through residues 598­609 in the C-terminal region (CTR) providing b-strand 1 of blade 1, and residues 327­358 of Kelch-repeat 1 providing b-strands 2­4 of the same blade [45]. Like other Kelch proteins, each blade of KEAP1 contains a conserved `double-glycine motif' at the end of b-strand 2 (Gly332 and Gly333, Gly378 and Gly379, Gly429 and Gly430, Gly476 and Gly477, Gly523 and Gly524, Gly570 and Gly571), a conserved tyrosine in b-strand 3 (Tyr345, Tyr396, Tyr443, Tyr490, Tyr537, Tyr584) and a conserved tryptophan in b-strand 4 (Trp352, Trp403, Trp450, Trp497, Trp544, Trp591). In addition, sequence alignment of each of the six Kelch-repeats within KEAP1 revealed an arginine situated to the N-terminal side of b-strand 1, a valine within b-strand 1, a tyrosine

within b-strand 2, and a Glu or Asp residue within b-strand 3 that were conserved in all six blades. Thus, a consensus sequence across all of the KEAP1 blades could be proposed as follows: -R-(x)6-V-(x)5-Y-(x)2G-G-(x)9­14-E/D-(x)1-Y-(x)6-W- across b-strand 1 to b-strand 4 [45]. The crystal structure of the entire KEAP1 protein remains undefined, but the structure of the Kelch-repeat domain has been solved [45]. Crystallography revealed that the conserved `double-glycine motif' at the end of b-strand 2 is essential for the structural integrity of each blade because their backbone atoms possess conformations that cannot be adopted by other amino acids, and they participate in hydrogen bonding with backbone atoms in b-strand 3 and the conserved Arg residue situated before b-strand 1 [45]. In turn, this conserved arginine was shown to interact with the conserved Glu or Asp residue in b-strand 3 [45]. A conserved hydrogen-bonding network therefore seems to exist in each Kelch-repeat of KEAP1 that ensures the blades fold correctly. The conserved tyrosine in b-strand 3 and the tryptophan in b-strand 4 are situated near the top of the propeller, at the interface between the blades, and contribute to hydrophobic interactions between individual blades [45]. The crystal structure also revealed localized regions of positive charge on the bottom side of the propeller that arises primarily through the presence of the conserved Arg residue located to the N-terminal side of b-strand 1.

ingly, 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine treatment restored KEAP1 mRNA levels [110]. These data indicate that NRF2 can be upregulated by KEAP1 epigenetic silencing. NRF2 somatic mutations: their molecular importance in KEAP1-mediated repression The discovery of KEAP1 mutations in lung cancer led to the suggestion that such an event was beneficial to neoplastic cells during carcinogenesis because it resulted in constitutive NRF2 activation. However, the deregulation of other KEAP1-binding partners, rather than loss of NRF2 repression, could account for the putative selective advantage during tumour development. Recent findings by Shibata et al. [111] provide direct support for the hypothesis that KEAP1 mutations are beneficial to tumours because they enable NRF2 dysregulation. They identified NRF2 point mutations in 11 of 103 patients with lung cancer and in three of 12 patients with head and neck cancers. Most importantly, the NRF2 mutations clustered around codons for amino acids 24­34 and 75­82, which respectively encompass the DLG and the ETGE motifs that bind KEAP1. Of the 14 NRF2 mutations, six were within the DLG motif and eight were within the ETGE motif (Table 3). Thus, it seems that during tumourigenesis, substitutions in either the DLG or the ETGE motifs have been selected as a means by which negative control of NRF2 by KEAP1 can be abolished. The finding that NRF2 mutations commonly occur around amino acids 24­34 and 75­82 implies that certain models for KEAP1-mediated NRF2 repression are probably not of major physiological importance. Overall, model 3 described earlier, in which NRF2 protein stability is controlled by KEAP1, seems to provide the most plausible explanation for the presence of two mutation `hot-spots' in NRF2. In one of its versions, a `two-site tethering' process is required to immobilise Lys residues between the DLG and ETGE motifs and to enable Cul3ÀRbx1-mediated NRF2 ubiquitylation (Figure 2). By contrast, models 1 and 2 seem

less plausible because they do not explain why loss of the low-affinity DLG motif activates NRF2 when the highaffinity ETGE-binding site is still present and can interact with KEAP1. Moreover, models 4 and 5 provide no explanation for any of the somatic mutations present in NRF2. The importance of KEAP1 and NRF2 mutations during carcinogenesis The finding that KEAP1 and NRF2 mutations occur in several tumour types raises questions about when and why they occur. It needs to be established whether mutations in these genes occur during the initiation, promotion or progression stages of tumour development. In human lung cancer, the most common mutations are found in TP53 (the gene encoding p53), Rb1 (retinoblastoma 1), B-cell CLL/ lymphoma 2 (BCL2), fragile histidine triad gene (FHIT)

and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (which encodes p16INK4a). These mutations occur at a frequency of >50% in NSCLC or SCLC [112]. Based on the available results, it can be estimated that KEAP1 and NRF2 mutations occur at a frequency of $25% in lung cancer. This frequency indicates that the upregulation of ARE-driven genes is likely to occur during promotion and/or progression, rather than the initiation stage of tumourigenesis. In considering why lung tumours specifically acquire KEAP1 and NRF2 mutations, it seems most likely that the resulting upregulation of the ARE-gene battery results in a decrease in apoptosis and an increase in cell proliferation. It would be helpful to know whether or not mutations in KEAP1 and NRF2 occur in combination with mutations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes involved in functions such as proliferation, anti-apoptosis, mutagenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis because this might indicate complementation between upregulation of ARE-driven genes and the increase in other activities relevant to tumourigenesis. Tumour development and survival requires that they assume new characteristics including autonomous growth, evasion of apoptosis, reduced sensitivity to anti-growth signals, invasion of normal tissue, limitless potential to replicate, and provision of sufficient blood supply [113]. During tumour promotion, the high mitochondrial activity and ATP production required for cell growth and division generates an increased ROS burden that, if not countered by an increased production of antioxidants within the tumour, would cause cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. It is therefore plausible that NRF2 upregulation could antagonise apoptosis precipitated by increased ROS production. It is also likely that the overproduction of GSH and thioredoxin that occurs upon NRF2 activation might stimulate cell growth by increasing the activity of transcription factors such as activator protein 1 (AP-1) [114]. Microarray experiments have revealed that NRF2 regulates several growth factors, including fibroblast growth factor 13, and transforming growth factors b1 and b2, and growth factor receptors, such as Eph receptor A2 and advanced glycosylation end-productspecific receptor (Table 1); thus, it seems likely that NRF2 activation will stimulate proliferation of certain cells. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that cell-cycle progression is impaired in mouse Nrf2À/À epithelial cells [115] and by the observation that stable knockdown of NRF2 in lung A549 cells (containing mutant KEAP1) greatly reduced cell proliferation, abolished anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and prevented their growth as a xenograft in nude mice [116]. During rapid growth, cells are likely to be susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress [117], and it is possible that NRF2 activation can help to alleviate this type of stress [78]. A more tentative possibility is that, in lung cancer, and also head and neck tumours, the presumed advantage to the tumour of NRF2 upregulation might be to combat certain environmental pressures; for example, exposure to high levels of O2 or products of combustion. The ability of NRF2 to antagonise inflammatory processes might also be of particular value to neoplastic cells that are regularly exposed to cigarette smoke [15,23]. In gall bladder cancer, the advantage of NRF2 upregulation might stem from the exposure to toxic drugs or
184

endobiotics that are metabolised by the liver and secreted into bile. It is also possible that gall stones might stimulate chronic inflammation that could provide the pressure to give a selective advantage to neoplastic cells with constitutively active NRF2. Overcoming NRF2-mediated drug resistance Patients with lung tumours that contain mutant KEAP1 or NRF2 have a worse prognosis than patients with lung tumours lacking such mutations [111]. It therefore seems that just as NRF2 activation by cancer chemopreventive agents in experimental animals protects normal cells against cytotoxic agents, so too might activation of NRF2 in human tumours protect malignant cells against chemotherapeutic drugs. This interpretation is consistent with in vitro experiments showing that NRF2 activation and subsequent induction of the ARE-gene battery confers resistance against cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide and 5fluorouracil [107­109]. It is therefore desirable to devise strategies to either antagonise NRF2 directly or exploit upregulated ARE-driven genes to activate cytotoxic prodrugs. The strategy of using cytochromes P450 to activate prodrugs, such as cyclophosphamide, has been exploited many times in cancer chemotherapy. This approach could also be employed in tumours with constitutively activated NRF2. In this case, drug-metabolising enzymes, such as NQO1 or aldo-keto reductases, which are likely to be overexpressed in tumours with mutant KEAP1 or NRF2, could be used to activate cytotoxic pro-drugs. This area warrants further investigation. Transcription factors that antagonise NRF2 do so by either competing for binding to AREs or by inhibiting NRF2 through a physical association (Figure 3). Small MAF proteins, and the immediate early proteins c-Fos and Fra1 can compete with NRF2 for binding to AREs [118,119]; therefore, strategies to increase the activity of these factors would be expected to inhibit ARE-driven gene expression in tumour cells harbouring KEAP1 or NRF2 mutations. Furthermore, several transcription factors, including activating transcription factor (ATF) 3, estrogen receptor (ER) a, short form estrogen-related receptor (SFERR) b, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)g and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)a have been reported to form inhibitory complexes with NRF2 [120­124]. Nuclear factor-kB also antagonizes NRF2, but in this instance it entails competition for CREB-binding protein and recruitment of histone deacetylase to MafK [125]. It might therefore be possible to downregulate the ARE-gene battery in cancer cells that express constitutively activated NRF2 by treating them with agents such as transforming growth factor b1, 17b-estradiol, troglitazone or retinoic acid to activate ATF3, ERa, SFERRb, PPARg or RARa. Numerous laboratories have reported that NRF2 activity can be regulated by protein kinases such as CK2, ERK2, ERK5, GSK-3b, PI3K and PKC [73­81]. The use of kinase inhibitors might also provide a means of inactivating NRF2 when it evades repression by KEAP1. NRF2 is negatively regulated through its Neh6 domain in a redox-independent manner [42]. Although the mechanism

Figure 3. Network of transcription factors that regulate NRF2. The transcription factors NRF1, NRF2, NRF3, p53, BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1), BACH2 and cFos are recruited to AREs in gene promoters and therefore control the expression of genes such as GSTA4, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and NQO1. As shown, NRF2 is subject to repression by KEAP1 under normal homeostatic conditions, and this repressor activity is subject to antagonism by redox stressors such as 4hydroxynonenal through modification of Cys residues in the BTB-Kelch protein [55]. Furthermore, NRF2 can itself be negatively controlled through a physical association with ATF3, short form ERRb, PPARg or RARa [120­124]. Red lines indicate repressive activity.

is not known, the Neh6 domain provides another route by which the factor could be repressed. Concluding remarks The unexpected finding in recent years that KEAP1 and NRF2 are mutated in lung, gall bladder, and head and neck cancers indicates that KEAP1 should be classed as a tumour suppressor protein. The discovery of these mutations provides us with an apparent conundrum: NRF2 protects normal cells against carcinogenesis, but its constitutive activation in certain tumours apparently contributes to the survival and growth of cancer cells. In the context of normal cells, compelling evidence exists that activation of NRF2 by therapeutic doses of cancer chemopreventive agents provides short-term protection against genotoxic compounds and the initiation of tumourigenesis [34­36]. Paradoxically, in lung, gall bladder and head and neck cancers, it seems likely that the presence of NRF2 in a permanently hyperactive state contributes to promotion and/or progression of neoplastic disease. It could be argued that the finding of somatic mutations in KEAP1 and NRF2 observed in certain tumours merely represents serendipity, and is of no biological consequence. Such a view, however, overlooks the fact that the somatic mutations in the genes for these two proteins do not seem to be random, but rather target parts of the two proteins that are known to be either structurally or functionally important; those in KEAP1 frequently occur within nucleotides encoding the crucial `double-glycine motif' [107­109], and those in NRF2 only

occur in codons for amino acids around the DLG and ETGE motifs [111]. The contention that dys-regulation of NRF2 contributes to the tumour phenotype is strongly supported by the finding that stable knockdown of the CNC­bZIP protein in lung cancer cell lines with mutant KEAP1 greatly decreased their rate of proliferation [116]. Although KEAP1 and NRF2 mutations have been reported in cancers of the lung, gall bladder, and head and neck, it should be recognized that several tumours, such as prostate cancer [126], do not seem to overexpress NRF2. Therefore, KEAP1 and NRF2 mutations are unlikely to occur in all tumour types. To help define the role that hyperactive Nrf2 might have in tumour promotion in a range of organs, investigations using tissue-specific Keap1null mice would be most informative, although liverspecific knockout of Keap1 does not seem to result in spontaneous hepatoma in the mouse [19,23]. The conclusion that constitutively active NRF2 might aid tumourigenesis echoes an older body of literature in which high doses of cancer chemopreventive phenolic antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyanisole, which activates NRF2, were reported to promote tumour development of the forestomach and urinary bladder in rodents [127]. The finding that somatic mutations occur in tumours causing constitutive NRF2 activation, coupled with the older data about high-dose treatment of animals with phenolic antioxidants, should sound a cautionary note [128]. Treatment of humans with doses of chemopreventive agents that affect a continuous and maximal NRF2 activation should possibly be avoided in humans. Regular treatment for short periods with an appropriate therapeutic dose of a range of chemopreventive agents is likely to be a more prudent strategy than constant treatment with a maximally tolerated dose of a single agent.
