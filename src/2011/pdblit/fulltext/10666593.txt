The molecular structure and structural transition of the a-helical capsid in filamentous bacteriophage Pf1
The major coat protein in the capsid of Pf1 ®lamentous bacteriophage (Inovirus) forms a helical assembly of about 7000 identical protein subunits, each of which contains 46 amino-acid residues and can be closely approximated by a single gently curved -helix. Since the viral DNA occupies the core of the tubular capsid and appears to make no signi®cant speci®c interactions with the capsid proteins, the capsid is a simple model system for the study of the static and dynamic properties of -helix assembly. The capsid undergoes a reversible temperature-induced structural transition at about 283 K between two slightly different helix forms. The two forms can coexist without an intermediate state, consistent with a ®rst-order structural phase transition. The molecular model of the higher temperature form was re®ned using improved X-ray ®bre diffraction data and new re®nement and validation methods. The re®nement indicates that the two forms are related by a change in the orientation of the capsid subunits within the virion, without a signi®cant change in local conformation of the subunits. On the higher temperature diffraction pattern there is a region of observed intensity that is not consistent with a simple helix of identical subunits; it is proposed that the structure involves groups of three subunits which each have a slightly different orientation within the group. The grouping of subunits suggests that a change in subunit libration frequency could be the basis of the Pf1 structural transition; calculations from the model are used to explore this idea.

1. Introduction
Many types of ®lamentous bacteriophage have been identi®ed, all sharing common features, although different strains differ in detail. The virion is about 6 nm in diameter and 800±2000 nm long (depending on the strain), comprising a capsid of several thousand major coat protein subunits in a helical array surrounding a core of single-stranded circular DNA, with a few minor proteins capping the two ends of the virion. The major coat protein subunits have about 50 amino-acid residues, are largely -helix and are held together in the virion by hydrophobic interactions between apolar domains in the central region of the elongated subunits. The negatively charged N-terminal region is at the outer surface of the protein sheath, whereas the C-terminal region occupies the inner surface of the sheath and carries positively charged basic residues that help to neutralize the negative charges on the DNA core.

Bacteriophage Pf1 -helical capsid

research papers
X-ray ®bre diffraction can give accurate information about the symmetry operators relating the protein subunits of the virion and is therefore well suited to studying small differences in symmetry. Two symmetry classes of ®lamentous bacteriophage have been identi®ed. Class I includes the widely studied Ff (fd, f1, M13) group and class II includes the Pf1 and Pf3 strains. The architecture of the Pf1 capsid and the shape of the protein subunit were initially determined by direct interpretation of the distribution of strong diffracted intensity on low-resolution ®bre patterns, supplemented by molecular modelling, Fourier transform and electron-density calculations (Marvin et al., 1974; Nakashima et al., 1975; Marvin & Wachtel, 1975, 1976). Each 46-residue subunit measures about 1 Â 7 nm, with its gently curved -helix axis oriented at a small angle to the virion axis. The shape and orientation of each subunit are tightly restrained by its neighbours, as the subunits form an overlapping interdigitated helical array. Despite the curvature of the subunit, the (9, 2) backbone torsion angles are within the accepted range for -helices (Marvin & Wachtel, 1975, 1976). The low-resolution diffraction data did not resolve some symmetry ambiguities in the Pf1 virion architecture and various attempts were made to resolve some of them using indirect approaches (Day & Wiseman, 1978; Makowski & Caspar, 1978, 1981). The ambiguities were eventually fully resolved using higher resolution diffraction data from native virions and heavy-atom derivatives, and using a maximumentropy method to calculate a model-independent electrondensity distribution (Nave et al., 1979, 1981; Marvin et al., 1981, 1987; Bryan et al., 1983; Bryan, 1987), enabling a molecular model to be built and re®ned against the quantitative X-ray data (Bryan et al., 1983; Marvin, 1990a,b; Marvin et al., 1992; Gonzalez et al., 1995). The canonical class II Pf1 virion has 27 subunits in ®ve turns of a right-handed helix with an axial Ê repeat c of about 75±80 A (c varies slightly with the water content of the ®bre; Marvin et al., 1974). The class I phages have a similar architecture, with similar nearest-neighbour packing but slightly different symmetry. The fact that Inovirus virions with quite different coat protein sequences have similar overall structures suggests that the general structure depends more on geometry than on speci®c biochemical details (discussed in Marvin, 1990a,b). The Pf1 virion undergoes a reversible temperature-induced structural transition between the canonical higher temperature form (Pf1H) above about 283 K and a lower temperature form (Pf1L) below this temperature; bacteriophages fd and Pf3 do not show such a transition (Wachtel et al., 1976, 1977; Nave et al., 1979; Hinz et al., 1980; Marvin et al., 1981, 1992; Welsh, Symmons et al., 1998). As a consequence of the transition, a small change in the relationship between one subunit and the next is ampli®ed over the 2000 nm length of the Pf1 virion, such that one end of the virion rotates by about 15 turns with respect to the other end and the length of the virion changes by about 100 nm. In this study, we report improved diffraction data from Pf1H and use these data to re®ne the Pf1H structure. We then compare the Pf1H and Pf1L structures to gain further understanding of the structural transition.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of phage and X-ray fibre diffraction

The Pf1 phage was grown and puri®ed as described by Nave et al. (1981). X-ray ®bre-diffraction patterns were obtained and processed essentially as described by Welsh, Symmons et al. (1998) for the structurally similar phage Pf3. Well aligned ®bres were prepared by drying gels of pure virions under controlled relative humidity and temperature in a strong magnetic ®eld (Nave et al., 1979, 1981). The virion symmetry depends on the temperature at which the ®bre is prepared, but the symmetry is ®xed once the ®bre is dry. Diffraction data were collected at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory, using the ®bre camera on station 7.2 (Shotton et al., 1998). Pf1H diffraction patterns were processed using the CCP13 suite of computer programs (http:// www.dl.ac.uk/SRS/CCP13). For Pf1L, we used the diffraction data of Gonzalez et al. (1995), Protein Data Bank entry r4ifmsf. These Pf1L data show true three-dimensional continÊ uous transform to between 3 and 4 A resolution along the Ê resolution in the meridional direction. layer-lines and to 2.6 A Amalgamated Pf1L amplitudes were generated by ®rst determining the indices m from the helix selection rule lH = 5n + 27m for layer-lines lH in the Pf1H patterns that have superposed Bessel function terms of order n. Intensity distributions on layer-lines lL having corresponding indices (n, m) in the Pf1L helix selection rule lL = 13n + 71m were then added to form amalgamated layer-line distributions for the Pf1L diffraction patterns in the Pf1H symmetry. There is a discontinuity in the amalgamated Pf1L layer-line distribution on l = 4 Ê at about R = 0.1 AÀ1 that re¯ects the corresponding discontinuity on l = 8 (m = À3, n = 17) of the Pf1L data reported by Gonzalez et al. (1995). The intensity shoulder at about Ê 0.08 AÀ1 on l = 8 in the Pf1L data of Marvin et al. (1987) was deleted by Gonzalez et al. (1995) because of concern that this shoulder might in part arise from overlapping very strong l = 7 intensity; the discontinuity in the amalgamated distribution is an artifact of this data treatment. We plot the calculated amplitude distribution  [ n jFnYl Rj2 1a2 for superposed Bessel function terms on each layer-line l for comparison with the observed amplitude distribution Il(R)1/2. The surface lattice or radial projection of a helix is generated by projecting equivalent points in each subunit along a radius onto a cylindrical surface concentric with the helix axis; the surface is opened ¯at and viewed from outside the helix. Equivalent points are indexed as k = 0, 1, 2, F F F , from an arbitrary origin point 0 along the basic helix, which is the helix with the smallest increase in z from one unit to the next. The coordinates (9, z) of the surface lattice points are (kT, kH), where T is the unit twist and H is the unit rise.
2.2. Model building and refinement

Our approach to determining the structure of a ®lamentous bacteriophage by model-building methods has been described by Marvin (1990a,b), Gonzalez et al. (1995) and Welsh, Symmons et al. (1998). We try throughout the re®nement to

maintain the simplest model consistent with the evidence (all the evidence, not just the X-ray data) and try to avoid introducing unnecessary independent variables, such as a break in the -helix. The Pf1H X-ray ®bre-diffraction data extend to Ê only about 3 A resolution and include superposed Bessel function terms on some layer-lines. To reduce the number of independent variables, we restrain the subunit in the Pf1H model to have the same local conformation as it has in the Pf1L symmetry. The dependent variables include not only the X-ray data but also the stereochemical constraints of protein structure and speci®c chemical and spectroscopic information about the phage, as discussed by Marvin (1990a,b) and Gonzalez et al. (1995). We restrain the (9, 2) backbone torsion angles to be within Æ20 of the target values. Since the re®ned Pf1L model (Gonzalez et al., 1995, PDB entry 4ifm) is -helix from residue 6 onwards, we use as targets the values of model 4ifm for the (non-helix) residues 1±5, but the values of the standard -helix (À65, À39 ) for residues 6±46. In protein structures determined from high-resolution diffraction data, the (9, 2) distribution for -helix regions is quite narrow (Walther & Cohen, 1999) and we ®nd that restraining the torsion angles in our models during re®nement to be within Æ5 of the target values does not signi®cantly affect the ®nal R value or the ®nal model. However, we used the Æ20 target range so that possible 310 helix with (9, 2) near (À70, À20 ) will not be excluded by the restraints. We also restrained 11 to be within Æ20 of the target values, which are À67 (or 173 for Val) for most residues; however, for 11 not in the À67 rotamer in model 4ifm, we used the 4ifm values as target. We re®ned models essentially as described by Welsh, Symmons et al. (1998) for the structurally similar phage Pf3. È We used restrained Cartesian simulated annealing (Brunger & Rice, 1997) from 3000 to 0 K in steps of 50 K, as implemented in FX-PLOR (Wang & Stubbs, 1993), a modi®cation of È X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) for ®bre diffraction. We used the CHARMm all-hydrogen force ®elds (topology and parameter ®les topallh22x.pro and parallh22x.pro) because our method of correcting for solvent (see x2.3) requires inclusion of all H atoms. At the end of the re®nement, we regularized the coordinates by a few cycles of conjugate-gradient energy minimization using the force ®elds de®ned by Engh & Huber (1991), in order to enable direct comparison of energies with those of model 4ifm. The r.m.s. difference between all non-H atom coordinates of the ®nal re®ned model and the regularÊ ized model was 0.1 A. Although the value of the helix repeat c measured on diffraction patterns varies slightly with the water content of the ®bre, this variation has a negligible effect on the distribution of calculated intensity along the layer-lines and we used Ê Ê a standard c = 78.3 A for Pf1H and c = 216.5 A for Pf1L when building and re®ning models. For Pf1L, only one Bessel function term contributes to each data point. The data in PDB entry r4ifmsf are oversampled along the layer-lines by about a factor of three, but if we use only every third data point, there are 1183 independent data Ê points in the resolution range 12±2.6 A. We calculated free R values from ten independent simulated-annealing re®nements,

omitting randomly about 10% of the 1183 independent data È points as for single-crystal data (Brunger, 1997), rather than blocks of layer-lines as described by Welsh, Symmons et al. (1998) for Pf3. For Pf1H, there are superposed Bessel function terms on the layer-lines. Millane (1989) described a method to calculate the largest likely R value for ®bre-diffraction patterns with superposed Bessel function terms. The value calculated by Millane (1989) for the Pf1H symmetry is 0.38 for data Ê extending to 3 A resolution, assuming ten superposed Bessel function terms. However, comparison of the experimental diffraction data from Pf1H with that from Pf1L indicates that the maximum signi®cant Bessel function order |n|max is 30, corresponding to no more than three superposed Bessel function terms on any layer-line (Marvin et al., 1992; Gonzalez et al., 1995). We also calculated transforms of our Pf1H model for |n|max = 30 and for |n|max = 60 and could detect no difference between these two transforms within the accuracy of the experimental data. In our re®nement and transform calculations we used |n|max = 30. We estimate from the equations of Millane (1989) that the largest likely R value is 0.53. We calculated free R values for Pf1H as described by Welsh, Symmons et al. (1998) for Pf3 by omitting blocks of layer-lines corresponding to about 10% of the data. We generated molecular graphics using the programs BOBSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991; Esnouf, 1997) and Raster3D (Merritt & Bacon, 1997).

2.3. Correction for solvent and DNA

Diffraction at low resolution is affected by solvent and to correct for solvent we used Babinet's principle (Langridge et al., 1960); however, we de®ned the molecular volume of the whole virion instead of using water-weighted atomic scattering factors. We de®ned the shape of the protein capsid model and then calculated the transform of uniform density solvent inside this volume, which we subtracted from the transform of the molecule (including all H atoms) calculated relative to vacuum, as described by Marvin & Wachtel (1976) and Marvin Ê et al. (1992). We applied a temperature factor B = 200 A2 to the solvent transform to ensure that any false detail in the solvent correction did not affect the higher resolution data. Each virion is surrounded not by pure water (electron Ê density 0.334 e AÀ3), but by a solution containing salt ions and other virions; the true background density may be as high as Ê 0.38 e AÀ3 (Specthrie et al., 1987). We have explored the consequences of changing the background density in this range and ®nd that it makes little difference to the calculated intensity except on the equator (l = 0) in the J0 region. Small changes in the molecular volume also have little effect on the non-equatorial layer-lines, but they do affect the protein transform in the J0 region of the equator and therefore indirectly affect how the calculated DNA-model transform contributes to the equator. The DNA in the virion does not contribute off the equator of the diffraction pattern (Welsh, Marvin et al., 1998), so we used a cylindrically symmetrical

map calculated from the J0 transform of the DNA model of Marvin et al. (1992) to represent the DNA. The observed equatorial data for the higher order Bessel functions (i.e. not J0) includes both complex conjugates, and to calculate electron density it is necessary to correct for this effect, as pointed out by Symmons et al. (1995). The reason for this correction can be illustrated by a simple thought experiment. Imagine a non-integral helix with (say) not quite nine units per turn. For suf®ciently well resolved layer-lines, J9 contributions will be observed off the equator in both the upper and lower halves of the ®bre-diffraction pattern and only one of these would be included in any calculation. Now imagine that the helix changes slightly to precisely nine units per turn; both J9 contributions merge on the equator, but still only one of them should be used in any calculation. The re®nement program FX-PLOR does not take account of this effect and both complex conjugates of higher order Bessel function terms are calculated on the equator, so we left our observed data uncorrected for this effect in re®nement calculations. This means that higher resolution equatorial data enter the re®nement at double weight, but since the lowest order non-zero Bessel function on the equator of Pf1H is J27, in practice the error introduced into our re®nement is negligible. To calculate electron-density distributions, we used the program DIFF (Nave et al., 1981), which does deal correctly with the complex conjugates on the equator. To re®ne details of the model, we used only non-equatorial Ê diffraction data in the resolution range 12±3 A, where the calculated (non-solvent-corrected) data are on the same scale as the observed data. However, for re®nement that may involve displacement of the entire -helix subunit, it is important to include the low-resolution data. In our early re®nement of Pf1 models (Marvin, 1990a,b; Marvin et al., 1992), we used the Jack±Levitt method (Jack & Levitt, 1978; Deisenhofer et al., 1985). This method de®nes the direction to move coordinates using (Fo À Fc) difference electron-density maps, which are convenient because the Fc can be calculated using the solvent-corrected transform of the model. To include the solvent correction in our re®nement with FXPLOR, we ®rst calculated the transform of our current model, including solvent contributions, in cylindrical polar coordinates. We used the calculated superposed Bessel function terms on each layer-line to separate the observed diffraction amplitudes in the ratio of the calculated Bessel function terms and applied the calculated phases to each observed Bessel function term. We calculated a map of uniform solvent density ®lling the molecular volume and added the transform of this map to the observed phased transform; we subtracted the J0 transform of the central DNA core. We then converted this total transform back to unphased `solvent-andDNA-corrected' data. We used Ê these data from 50 to 3 A resoluFigure 1 tion for re®nement of the protein Ê X-ray ®bre diffraction patterns of Pf1. (a) Pf1L pattern. The measured axial repeat is c = 214.5 A.

3. Results
3.1. Choice of the Pf1L model

Fig. 1(a) shows the Pf1L diffraction pattern and Fig. 1(b) shows the Pf1H pattern. The helix parameters relating one Ê subunit to the next in the helix are (TL, HL) = (65.915 , 3.05 A) Ê for Pf1L and (TH, HH) = (66.667 , 2.90 A) for Pf1H. The Pf1L model was initially re®ned to give a fully -helix model [PDB entry 1ifm, which is the Pf1L model of Marvin (1990a,b), called

`model A' by Marvin et al. (1992)]. This model was further re®ned by simulated annealing (Gonzalez et al., 1995) in parallel as a fully -helix model (PDB entry 2ifm) and as a model with the N-terminal ®ve residues unwound (PDB entry 4ifm). A somewhat different model (PDB entry 1p®) for Pf1L has been proposed (but not re®ned) by Liu & Day (1994). We calculate that the correlation coef®cient measuring the quantitative ®t of the 1p® model transform to the X-ray data is only 0.50, compared with 0.90 for model 2ifm, and the energy of non-bonded contacts between neighbouring subunits is very high. Liu & Day (1994) constructed their model with some regions of 310 helix rather than -helix in the subunit. We investigated this type of model further, using several different methods to re®ne model 1p® against stereochemical constraints and quantitative X-ray data. In all cases the re®ned model moved towards model 2ifm, but examination of the model indicated that further re®nement would require rebuilding the model to remove incorrect interlocks between side chains of adjacent subunits introduced by the assumption of 310 helix. Since superposed Bessel function terms do not need to be considered with our Pf1L diffraction data, we calculated the È crystallographic free R value (Brunger, 1997) and the free R/R ratio (Tickle et al., 1998) for models 2ifm, 4ifm and 1p® (Table 1). The ratio of the number of atoms to the number of independent re¯ections is 322/1183 = 0.27. According to Fig. 1 of Tickle et al. (1998), the expected free R/R ratio for our case is about 1.3; values much larger than this may indicate ¯aws in the model. Models 2ifm and 4ifm are clearly preferable to 1p®

as judged by the free R values and the free R/R ratios. Models 2ifm and 4ifm cannot be distinguished from each other on the basis of the free R values or the free R/R ratios. We chose model 4ifm on the basis of electron-density maps and other grounds, as discussed by Gonzalez et al. (1995). The intensity distributions along corresponding layer-lines of Pf1L and Pf1H are similar for the two forms (Figs. 1a and 1b; see also Nave et al., 1979), indicating that there is little change in the structure of the subunit between Pf1L and Pf1H. To compare quantitatively the Pf1H with the Pf1L diffraction data, we combined the Bessel function terms of the Pf1L pattern that are superposed on the Pf1H patterns to create an `amalgamated' Pf1L amplitude distribution and compared this with the observed Pf1H amplitude distribution (Fig. 2). The two amplitude distributions are almost indistinguishable at low resolution, although they do differ slightly at higher resolution, consistent with small changes in subunit shape or sideÊ chain orientation. On l = 16 at about R = 0.045 AÀ1 there is a maximum in the Pf1H data that is not observed in the corresponding region of the amalgamated Pf1L data; a corresponding maximum is also seen for Pf3 (Welsh, Symmons et al., 1998).

3.2. Refinement of the molecular structure of Pf1H

The protein subunits in the virion are closely packed, with the side chains of each subunit interlocked with the side chains of its neighbours. Therefore, the change in subunit shape caused by the transition from Pf1L to Pf1H is constrained by the change in virion helix parameters, which can be measured to 0.1% accuracy. The cylindrical polar atomic coordinates (9H, zH) of an initial model for Pf1H can be derived from the corresponding coordinates (9L, zL) of Pf1L by the equations (Marvin et al., 1992) 9H  9L  zL T H À T L aH L Y zH  zL H H aH L X 1a 1b

The coordinates of two slightly different Pf1H models are deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Entry 1ifn is the Pf1H model, as described by Marvin (1990a,b), derived from the Pf1L model 1ifm. Entry 2ifn (Gonzalez et al., 1995) is the Pf1H model derived from model 4ifm. Models 1ifn and 2ifn are similar except that the ®rst ®ve residues near the N-terminus are -helix in 1ifn but extended chain in 2ifn, as in the Pf1L model 4ifm. The orientation of Tyr25 is also different for these two models, but this has no structural signi®cance and simply re¯ects the absence of restraints on the outside of the virion. We chose model 2ifn for further study because it is most closely related to the re®ned Pf1L model 4ifm; there is no reason to suppose that the Pf1H to Pf1L transition would lead to an unwinding of the N-terminal residues. The transformation from Pf1L to Pf1H is almost a rigid-body rotation of the subunit around a radius through its centre, but there is also a

We mimicked this `quasi-rigidbody' motion during re®nement by restraining the (9, 2) and 11 torsion angles of the Pf1H models to be within the same rotamers as in the Pf1L models. We ®rst re®ned model 2ifn with respect to the observed data Ê from 12 to 3 A resolution. The progress of this re®nement was similar to that found for Pf3 (Welsh, Symmons et al., 1998). We then used the `solvent-and-DNA-corrected' data from 50 to Ê 3 A resolution. Using the non-equatorial corrected data in the re®nement causes a shift in position of the whole subunit; adding the equatorial data (corrected for solvent and DNA) causes a small change in the conformation of the side chains near the DNA core. Re®ning group temperature factors Ê starting from a constant B = 10 A 2 led to values comparable L with those for the Pf1 model 4ifm. Since the Pf1L data are more extensive, in re®nement of the Pf1H models we used the non-H atomic temperature factors taken from the Pf1L model 4ifm. We re®ned ten models in parallel and from the ten models we chose that with the lowest R. The r.m.s. difference Ê between this model and the starting model 2ifn is 1.6 A over Ê all non-H atoms and 1.3 A over the backbone atoms. Validation of the re®ned model by calculation of the a posteriori free R value is illustrated in Fig. 4. The regions showing the largest differences between the models, mainly the larger side chains, coincide broadly with the regions having the largest temperature factors. Some properties of the re®ned model R Pf1H are listed in Table 2 and its transform is compared with the observed data in Fig. 5(a).
3.3. Evidence for grouping of subunits in Pf1H

The Pf1H diffraction patterns show near-meridional intenÊ sity on l = 16 at about R = 0.045 AÀ1 (Figs. 1b, 2 and 5a). Since the lowest order Bessel function term allowed on l = 16 for a helix of u = 27 units in ®ve turns is J13, intensity at Ê R = 0.045 AÀ1 is not consistent with diffraction from the Ê regular helix of protein subunits with maximum radius r = 35 A. It is unlikely that the l = 16 diffraction is a consequence either directly or indirectly of the DNA in the virion, because a similar effect is found for Pf3 phage and the different DNA:protein ratios of Pf1 and Pf3 imply quite different DNA structures (Welsh, Symmons et al., 1998). The amino-acid sequences of the Pf1 and Pf3 subunits have only about 15% identity and 40% similarity (Welsh, Symmons et al., 1998), so the l = 16 diffraction is also unlikely to be a consequence of some local sequence-speci®c property of the subunit. This `forbidden' intensity on l = 16 may arise from a perturbation of the 27/5 helix of subunits; however, since the forbidden intensity lies precisely on l = 16, the perturbation does not change the c repeat of the helix. This is possible for a perturbed helix with u an integral factor of 27; that is, u = 3 or u = 9. The perturbation would then take place within a group of nine or a group of three subunits, which would not be all identical to each other; however, there would still be three identical groups of nine or nine identical groups of Ê three within the 78.3 A axial c repeat. The selection rules for three groups of nine subunits or nine groups of three subunits would be, respectively, l  5n  3mY l  5n  9mX 2

For the ®rst option, the minimum Bessel function order on l = 16 is J1; for the second, it is J4. The ®rst Bessel function maximum of J1 is at J1(2%Rr) = 1.8 and of J4 is at J4(2%Rr) = 5.3. The radius in the virion correÊ sponding to these two options for R = 0.045 AÀ1 is Ê Ê for J1 (three groups of nine) and r = 18.7 A r = 6.4 A for J4 (nine groups of three). We re®ned perturbed models of both kinds with respect to the X-ray data. Ê Both kinds predict amplitude around R = 0.045 AÀ1 on l = 16, but the model with three groups of nine has more independent variables, so we chose the model with nine groups of three for further study, as it represents the simplest type of perturbation.

Fig. 6 illustrates how three slightly different subunits can be Ê grouped to give a helix with c = 78.3 A but with nine units in ®ve turns instead of 27 units in ®ve turns. The subunits in the unperturbed helix related by the helix parameters (T H, HH) are indexed as (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, F F F ) along the basic helix. For the perturbed helix, units (k = 0, 1, 2) are no longer precisely related by (T H, HH), but units (k = 0, 3, 6, 9, F F F ) are precisely related by the perturbed helix parameters (3T H, 3HH). Then in the perturbed helix, units (k = 0, 3, 6, 9, F F F ) all have the same structure, units (k = 1, 4, 7, 10, F F F ) all have the same structure and units (k = 2, 5, 8, 11, F F F ) all have the same structure. Why should the 27 nominally identical subunits in the helix repeat be grouped in clusters? Since this happens for both Pf1H and for Pf3, it must re¯ect a basic property of this packing geometry, not some trivial consequence of the subunit structure. Since the layer-line breadth in the `forbidden' region of l = 16 is indistinguishable from the breadth in neighbouring regions of the diffraction pattern, the coherence length of the perturbed structure is similar to that of the helix as a whole. To explore this question further, we re®ned the structure with respect to the diffraction data with the 27 units in the unit cell de®ned as nine groups of three related by strict non-crystallographic symmetry. Within each of these nine groups, the three subunits are related by non-crystallographic symmetry imposed by a harmonic restraint. For these re®ned models, the three subunits in the group have slightly different orientations. To decide to what extent this reorientation is de®ned by the diffraction data, we tried to re®ne models with the whole backbone ®xed or with just the C atoms ®xed, while allowing the side chains to move independently for the three subunits in the group. Re®nement of this sort was not successful in generating models that ®t the l = 16 X-ray data; the whole subunit must be free to move. The re®ned Pf1H model with a group of three subunits forming the asymmetric unit of a helix with nine units in ®ve turns we call model 3RPf1H. The calculated transform of the re®ned model is compared with the observed diffraction data in Fig. 5(b). There is also weak near-meridional intensity Ê observed on l = 26 at about R = 0.062 AÀ1 (not shown) that is Ê not permitted for a 27/5 helix with maximum radius r = 35 A, since the lowest order Bessel function term on l = 26 is J11. Model 3RPf1H predicts intensity in this region, although the quantitative ®t of the calculated to the observed transform is poor. The electron-density distribution for the three nonidentical units is shown in Fig. 7. The most convincing evidence for reorientation of subunits as the explanation of the l = 16 `forbidden' intensity is illustrated in Fig. 5(c). We ®tted a single subunit of model RPf1H as a rigid body separately to each of the three subunits in the asymmetric unit of model 3RPf1H and calculated the transform of this new perturbed model. The ®t of calculated to observed transform is essentially the same as for the original RPf1H model for most layer-lines; however, unlike RPf1H, this model predicts calculated intensity on l = 16 that ®ts well to the observed intensity. Except for a weak (non-observed) meridional peak on l = 9, the transform of this model shows no calculated intensity attributable to the other low-order Bessel function terms predicted by a 9/5 helix but not by a 27/5 helix (Fig. 5c). Rigid-body motion of the three subunits with respect to each other, with no change of shape or side-chain conformations, is suf®cient to explain the observed l = 16 nearmeridional intensity. Each subunit in the group of three has the same shape, but a slightly different orientation (Figs. 8a and 8b). The packing of the subunits is illustrated in Fig. 8(c). The structurally identical Ê subunits follow a set of 6-start helices with pitch 156.6 A (Fig. 6). The interactions between the identical subunits within the 6-start helices are the nearest-neighbour interactions 0±6; the main interactions between the (non-identical) adjacent 6-start helices are the next-nearest-neighbour interactions, 0±11 (Fig. 8c). Some Pf1H diffraction patterns show nearÊ meridional re¯ections at orders of about 156 A (Marvin et al., 1981), consistent with sets of structurally distinct 6-start helices. The Pf1 DNA model of Marvin et al. (1992) follows the 0±6 protein helices and grouping of protein subunits might relate to DNA±protein interactions.

Models RPf1H and 3RPf1H are compared in Table 2. There is no signi®cant difference in the quality of the two models. However, the perturbed model 3RPf1H has slightly lower internal energy and inter-subunit energy, and slightly lower R values, as expected from the fact that there are more independent variables in this model. The three subunits in the perturbed model have a similar shape, but are slightly slewed away from the orientation of the unperturbed subunit. The central regions of the subunits are still approximately related by the strict 27/5 symmetry, but the ends are displaced slightly (Figs. 8a and 8b). Releasing the strict symmetry constraints relating the subunits enables them to reorient slightly to give both a better ®t to the diffraction data and a lower energy. This might be expected from the fact that a group of three subunits has more independent variables than a single subunit, although the speci®city of the reorientation suggests that it is structurally signi®cant. the Pf1 transition takes place in solution, using a samplepreparation chamber with a temperature gradient of a few kelvin across the chamber. Fibre patterns of these samples showed a mixture of the Pf1H and the Pf1L diffraction patterns. The ratio of the Pf1H to the Pf1L patterns varied with the position in the sample chamber (i.e. with temperature). Fig. 1(c) shows such a mixture pattern with approximately equal amounts of the two forms. As can be seen from Fig. 9, all observed diffracted intensity can be assigned to one or the other of the two diffraction patterns: there is no evidence for any intermediate form (see also Marvin et al., 1981). The transition is analogous in this respect to a ®rst-order phase transition. We used the adiabatic mapping technique of Wachtel et al. (1976, 1977) to follow the path of the Pf1 structural transition. We slewed model 4ifm from the Pf1L symmetry to a set of models with helix parameters interpolated between those of Pf1L and Pf1H or extrapolated beyond them, using (1). Since the models are slightly distorted by slewing, we regularized the 3.4. The Pf1 structural transition stereochemistry of each model in the slewed set by nonStudies in solution are consistent with a Pf1 structural phase convergent energy minimization, including non-bonded transition with no intermediate states (Hinz et al., 1980; contacts to symmetry-related neighbouring subunits. The Marvin et al., 1992). To study the transition further, we results were similar to those of Wachtel et al. (1976, 1977). prepared ®bre samples near 283 K, the temperature at which There is no signi®cant energy barrier between the Pf1H and the Pf1L models, nor is there any signi®cant barrier to other nearby helix symmetries; there is also no signi®cant energy minimum in either of these models. The calculated internal energy of the capsid model does not in itself explain the speci®city of the Pf1 transition, as discussed by Marvin et al. (1992). The evidence for grouping of subunits suggests another approach to understanding the molecular basis of the Pf1 structural transition. As pointed out by Marvin et al. (1992), it is energetically feasible for subunits to librate within the virion; the calculated entropy of libration is appreciable at the transition temperature. We make the simplifying approximation that the subunits behave independently, with a libration frequency # that depends only on the local ®xed neighbours of a subunit (the `Einstein approximation'). This approximation has been used in analysis of libration in crystals of small organic molecules (Dorner, 1981). Marvin et al. (1992) determined the libration frequency for Pf1L model 1ifm by calculating the potential energy of a set of models, in each of which a single subunit was slewed within a ®xed Figure 7 Electron-density map of the three protein subunits in the 3RPf1H asymmetric unit. The array of neighbouring subunits according to (1). observed data and the calculated transform used to generate this map are as shown in Fig. From statistical physics (e.g. Kittel & Kroemer, 5(b). The electron density for the (5Fo À 4Fc) map was calculated as described by Welsh, 1980; Mandl, 1988), the free energy of libration Symmons et al. (1998) for the structurally similar phage Pf3.

We take the frequency #L of the lower temperature form to be #L = 8.0 Â 1011 sÀ1 (27 cmÀ1), as calculated by Marvin et al. (1992). As a crude approximation, we say that the protein at the higher temperature librates as a group of three subunits, with three times the mass of a single subunit but the same force constant, so #H = #L/31/2 = 4.6 Â 1011 sÀ1. We plot GL(T) and GH(T) as a function of T in Fig. 10. As an empirical correction for other possible contributions to the difference

between GL(T) and GH(T), we add a constant to all GH(T) so that the two curves cross at 283 K. The Gibbs free-energy difference in Fig. 10 between the lower temperature form at 273 K and the higher temperature form at 298 K is 0.17 kcal molÀ1 (or 0.7 kJ molÀ1), compared with the calorimetrically determined value of 0.9 kJ molÀ1 (Hinz et al., 1980). From Fig. 10 we can also determine the entropy of libration S = ÀdG/dT. For the lower temperature form TSL = 1.7 kcal molÀ1 and for the higher temperature form TSH = 2.0 kcal molÀ1. The calculated enthalpy of the transition, (HH À HL) = T(SH À SL) = 0.3 kcal molÀ1 (or 1.2 kJ molÀ1), compared with the calorimetrically measured enthalpy 14.5 kJ molÀ1 (Hinz et al., 1980). In these rough calculations, we have used 1ifm (rather than 4ifm) as the Pf1L model and have assumed that the force constant for Pf1H is the same as for Pf1L. If (for instance) we take #H = 0.4 Â 1010 sÀ1, with #L unchanged, the calculated Gibbs free-energy difference becomes 1.3 kJ molÀ1 (compared with the observed 0.9 kJ molÀ1) and the calculated enthalpy of the transition becomes 12.5 kJ molÀ1 (compared with the observed 14.5 kJ molÀ1). Further calculations, including a full analysis of normal modes (e.g. ben-Avraham & Tirion, 1995), and further experiments, especially neutron scattering (e.g. Dorner, 1981), will help to understand the details of this structural transition.

4. Discussion

Liu & Day (1994) have proposed that the Gly residues in Pf1 are structurally signi®cant and that the region of the subunit between Ile22 and Ala29 is more like 310 helix than -helix. Their proposal seems to have been inspired in part (Day et al., 1988) by Makowski et al. (1980), who proposed that the subunit consists of two distinct -helix segments connected by a non-helix linker. The ¯aws in the approach of Makowski et al. (1980) that led to the two-segment model lie in the attempt to use a low-resolution model to phase high-resolution data and the neglect of low-density hydrophobic side chains, and have been discussed by Marvin et al. (1981) and Nave et al. (1981). However, one could still imagine subunit models that involve elements of 310 helix. Some hydrogen bonds in our models are bifurcated, including both i3i + 3 (310) and i3i + 4 (-helix) hydrogen bonds, and for some residues the backbone torsion angles (9, 2) are closer to the canonical 310 values than to the canonical -helix values. However, the mean (9, 2) values in model R Pf1H over the region Ile22±Ala29 are (À63 Æ 11, À40 Æ 6 ), which are virtually identical to the mean over the whole -helix region (Table 2). It is doubtful that glycines are structurally signi®cant in ®lamentous bacteriophage, since glycines can be exchanged for other residues in the Ff structure (Williams et al., 1995). In particular, Gly24 of Pf1 corresponds in the aligned sequences to Gly23 of Ff (Nakashima et al., 1975; Marvin, 1990a,b) and Gly23 of Ff can be replaced by Arg, Asp, Ser or Ala while the phage remains viable (Williams et al., 1995). The distortions away from -helix near Gly are more likely to Figure 9 arise simply from the absence of Layer-line indexing of the mid-temperature Pf1 X-ray ®bre diffraction pattern.

or no 310 helix in the Pf1 coat protein and also con®rm that there is little change in the conformation of the subunit between Pf1H and Pf1L (Blanch et al., 1999). Despite the structural similarities between Pf1 and Pf3 phages, no Pf3 structural transition corresponding to the Pf1 transition has been observed. Welsh, Symmons et al. (1998) suggested that this might be a consequence of tighter DNA± protein interactions in Pf3, since there are over twice as many nucleotides per protein subunit in Pf3 as in Pf1. It might instead be a consequence of the fact that there are about twice as many subunits in the Pf1 virion as in Pf3, since transitions in small systems depend on the number of units in the system (Hill, 1963). It is also conceivable that it is a consequence of some difference in the minor proteins at the ends of the virion. In any case, further detailed comparison of the Pf1 and Pf3 structures should shed further light on the nature of the Pf1 transition. The Pf1 structural transition has some of the properties of structural transitions in molecular crystals, which are characterized by a change in orientation of the molecules rather than a change in translational centres of gravity (Dorner, 1981; Hsu & Nordman, 1983; Dove, 1993). For a molecule held together by internal covalent bonds, the dynamic modes of the whole molecule will have lower frequencies than the modes internal to the molecule, so the modes involving the whole molecule are most relevant to transitions at higher temperatures. In particular, the mode most closely associated with the reorientation of the molecule in the transition will be the most important in the libration: in our case, the libration along the slew direction. As the temperature decreases, there is a transition from a higher symmetry to a lower symmetry: in Pf1H there is an exact threefold screw axis with nine subunits in the asymmetric unit which is lost in Pf1L (Marvin et al., 1992). The potential well for libration may not be precisely harmonic, but may instead become broader as the temperature decreases (Dove, 1993). The frequency of subunit libration will then decrease with decreasing temperature until at the transition temperature the array becomes unstable and undergoes the transition to the lower symmetry Pf1L form. Our suggestion that the Pf1H structure involves groups of three subunits was prompted by the observation of nearmeridional intensity on l = 16 and these limited data might appear insuf®cient to justify the conclusions. However, this kind of perturbation would also, in principle, permit intensity owing to low-order Bessel function terms on many other layerlines and none of these is observed. The requirement to ®t these regions of zero observed intensity provides restraints on the model that are just as important as the requirement to ®t regions of observed intensity. The molecular basis of the perturbation is still unclear. The perturbation is unlikely to be a consequence of crystal packing forces between neighbouring virions in the ®bre, since it is seen in ®bres with various degrees of hydration and few crystalline re¯ections except on the equator. The differences between the subunits in the group of three (Fig. 8a) may appear to be of the same order as the differences between independent re®nements of the single subunit model (Fig. 4). In both cases, the models must explain the overall distribution of intensity on the diffraction pattern, so they cannot be very different. However, the differences between the subunits shown in Fig. 8(a) also explain the `forbidden' intensity on l = 16; they are speci®c, not random, differences. Although the subunits in the group of three in Fig. 8(a) may look different, this is a difference in orientation: they all have the same backbone conformation as the identical subunits in the unperturbed helix. Further evidence for the perturbed structure will be desirable, but we feel that it is a useful working hypothesis; a detailed examination of the reorientation of the subunits should be rewarding. The non-H atom coordinates of model RPf1H with a single protein subunit forming the asymmetric unit of a helix with 27 units in ®ve turns are deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entry 1ql1, the non-H atom coordinates of model 3RPf1H with a group of three subunits forming the asymmetric unit of a helix with nine units in ®ve turns are deposited as entry 1ql2 and the continuous transform diffraction amplitudes Il(R)1/2 Ê sampled along the layer-lines at intervals of R = 0.0025 AÀ1 are deposited as entry r1ql1sf.
