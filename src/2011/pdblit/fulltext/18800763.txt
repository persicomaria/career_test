Overexpression of AKT has an antiapoptotic effect in many cell types, and expression of dominant negative AKT blocks the ability of a variety of growth factors to promote survival. Therefore, inhibitors of AKT kinase activity might be useful as monotherapy for the treatment of tumors with activated AKT. Herein, we describe our lead optimization studies culminating in the discovery of compound 3g (GSK690693). Compound 3g is a novel ATP competitive, pan-AKT kinase inhibitor with IC50 values of 2, 13, and 9 nM against AKT1, 2, and 3, respectively. An X-ray cocrystal structure was solved with 3g and the kinase domain of AKT2, confirming that 3g bound in the ATP binding pocket. Compound 3g potently inhibits intracellular AKT activity as measured by the inhibition of the phosphorylation levels of GSK3 . Intraperitoneal administration of 3g in immunocompromised mice results in the inhibition of GSK3 phosphorylation and tumor growth in human breast carcinoma (BT474) xenografts.
Introduction AKT kinases have been implicated as key mediators of proliferation and survival pathways that are critical for cancer growth. As such, aberrant activation of AKT pathway has been observed in a variety of malignancies including breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancers. For example, increased AKT1 activity has been observed in about 40% of breast and ovarian cancers and >50% of prostate carcinomas. In addition, activation of AKT2 kinase has been observed in 30-40% of ovarian and pancreatic cancers whereas increased AKT3 enzymatic activity was found in estrogen-receptordeficient breast cancer and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, overexpression of AKT has an antiapoptotic effect in many cell types and expression of dominant negative AKT blocks the ability of a variety of growth factors to promote survival.1 Perturbations in both positive and negative regulators of AKT activity commonly occur in human cancers.2-4 Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a critical negative regulator of AKT, is lost in many cancers, including breast and prostate carcinomas, glioblastomas, and several cancer syndromes including Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, Cowden disease, and Lhermitte-Duclos disease.5,6 The importance of AKT mediated signaling in tumor proliferation and survival makes AKT kinases promising targets for therapeutic intervention.7-9 Therefore, inhibitors of AKT kinase activity could be useful for the treatment of tumors with activated AKT. In fact, several small molecule AKT inhibitors have recently been reported.10-13 Herein, we describe our lead optimization studies, which starting from

Compound 3g is a novel ATP competitive, pan-AKT kinase inhibitor with IC50 values of 2, 13, and 9 nM against AKT1, 2 and 3, respectively. Compound 3g inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a subset of tumor cells with activity that is consistent with intracellular inhibition of AKT kinase activity. Compound 3g also demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity in vivo and has been shown to inhibit BT474 tumor xenograft growth in mice.16 Compound 3g is currently in clinical trials as an iv agent to treat patients with solid tumors or hematological malignancies.

compound 1 started from 3-bromo-N-ethyl-5-nitro-4-pyridinamine2 (15) using established methods to append the 4-amino-1,2,5-oxadiazole.19,20 The synthesis of compound 10 and a key intermediate 26 was carried out as detailed in Scheme 2. Notable features include a tin(II) chloride mediated reduction of the nitro group in 15 with concomitant chlorination to give 22.21 The 4-amino-1,2,5-oxadiazole moiety was introduced as noted above to give 26. The phenol moiety in 28 was introduced by a selective halogen-metal exchange followed by reaction with trimethoxy borane and subsequent oxidation. Reaction with phenylboronic acids under Suzuki22 conditions followed by a Mitsunobu reaction with 1,1-dimethylethyl (3-hydroxypropyl)carbamate gave 10 after removal of the protecting groups. The alkyne-containing analogues 12a-d were synthesized in a similar manner starting from 26 (Scheme 3). Subsequent to the preparation of 28, we discovered that it was not

necessary to protect the amino group in the 4-amino-1,2,5oxadiazole moiety during the halogen-metal exchange reaction. Therefore, 26 was converted directly to the corresponding phenolic compound 29. A Cs2CO3-mediated alkylation with the corresponding alkyl halide followed by a reaction of the product with an appropriate terminal acetylene under Sonogashira conditions23 gave the penultimate products. Trifluoroacetic acid mediated deprotection gave the final compounds 12a-d. The alkyne-containing analogues 3a-h were also prepared from 29 (Scheme 4). Compound 29 was alkylated with an appropriate Boc-protected alkyl chloride or bromide. A Sonogashira reaction with 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol followed by removal of the protecting group gave compounds 3a-h. The heteroaryl containing analogues 11a-d were prepared by reacting suitably protected arylboronic acids or esters with 30 (Scheme 5). Removal of the protecting groups then furnished the final compounds.

Reaction with 4-methoxyphenethyl amine or (2S)-3-amino-1,2-propanediol followed by a Sonogashira reaction with 2-methyl-3-butyn-2ol completed the syntheses. Results and Discussion Lead Identification. The oxadiazole-containing compounds 1 and 2 were identified from the GSK compound collection as starting points for lead optimization, as both compounds were submicromolar inhibitors of AKT1 (Table 1). Furthermore, compounds structurally related to 1 and 2 have previously been described as ATP competitive inhibitors that bind in the ATP binding pocket of ROCK1 and MSK1 kinase.18-20 Not surprisingly, potent MSK1 and ROCK1 inhibition was also observed with 1 and 2 (Table 1). Side Chain Modifications at Position-7 To Optimize AKT Potency. A model of 1 in the ATP binding pocket of AKT2 was generated on the basis of the published cocrystal structure of an activated form of the AKT kinase domain containing a S474D mutation with GSK3 peptide and AMPPNP.24 The amine side chain of 1 was in proximity to the side chain carboxylic acid of Glu236 and the backbone carbonyl of Glu279 (Figure 2A). Initially, the lead optimization effort focused on increasing AKT kinase potency by varying the presentation of the amine-containing side chain to further optimize this interaction. A spacer consisting of four or five atoms between the imidazopyridine core and the amino group gave analogues with low micromolar to submicromolar IC50 values against the AKT isoforms (Table 2). There was no obvious preference for a primary versus secondary amine. There was a trend toward poorer AKT activity in the amide series when the side chain was constrained into a ring (2 versus 4, 5, 6, and 8). An ether link between the amine containing side chain and the imidazopyridine core consistently gave better AKT potency over the corresponding amide or alkylamine linked analogues (1 versus 5; 7 versus 8 or 9). Back-Pocket Selectivity Element. While modifications at the 7-position of the imidazopyridine core influenced AKT

activity, they had very little impact on kinase selectivity as measured by inhibition of MSK1 and ROCK1. Inspection of 1 docked into AKT2 revealed that the vector projecting from C4 of the imidazopyridine ring system was positioned to introduce a substituent into a pocket in the back cleft (Figure 2B).25 In AKT, a leucine residue lines the back of this pocket, whereas the corresponding residue in ROCK1 is a methionine. We reasoned that we could take advantage of this residue difference and improve selectivity for AKT by introducing a steric element at C4 of the imidazopyridine core. The side chain at C7 was fixed as an aminopropyl ether, while various groups were introduced at C4 of the imidazopyridine core (Table 3). In terms of AKT activity, there was a clear preference for five-membered over six-membered aryl rings in the back pocket (11a-c compared to 10). The nature and position of heteroatoms within the five-membered ring aryl groups impacted AKT activity. For example, pyrrole-containing analogues (11a and 11c) were slightly better inhibitors than the corresponding furanyl analogue 11b. In contrast, the pyrazole substituent 11d was not tolerated. Although AKT activity comparable to 1 and 7 could be maintained by introducing certain five-membered ring heteroaromatic groups at C4 of the imidazopyridine core, only modest improvements in kinase selectivity were achieved. We speculate that the five-membered heteroaryl rings did not penetrate deep enough into the back pocket to significantly impact the kinase selectivity with respect to ROCK1. Closer inspection of the model of 1 in AKT2 revealed that the opening into the back pocket was narrow. We reasoned that an alkyne spacer would fit better through this opening and potentially allow a range of substituents to be introduced at the terminus of the triple bond to explore interactions within this pocket. Indeed, the cyclopropylalkyne 12a retained AKT activity while significantly improving kinase selectivity against ROCK1 and RSK1. Introducing an alcohol at the terminus of the alkyne to give 12b substantially boosted AKT activity over 12a and further increased selectivity against ROCK and RSK1 by 83 and >200-fold, respectively. It was also clear that the geminal dimethyl groups contributed significantly to the selectivity (12b versus 12c). Adding an extra methylene between the alkyne and the carbinol moiety (12d) was detrimental to AKT activity, as was the introduction of an amine (13). Side Chain Modification To Optimize Cell Potency. The compounds listed in Table 3 were also evaluated for their ability to inhibit AKT-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3 in BT474 cells.7 By use of this assay, some of the more potent AKT analogues demonstrated low micromolar inhibition of GSK3 phosphorylation (11a, 11c, and 12a-c). Having identified the 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol group as a key kinase selectivity element, efforts were redirected to further SAR exploration around the amine-containing side chain at position-7 of the imidazopyridine core to try to increase cellular potency. In general, relatively minor changes in AKT activity and kinase selectivity were seen as a result of the structural modifications at R7 (Table 4). However, these changes did impact cellular activity. For example, introducing a pendant aromatic ring (3d and 14a) or including a cyclic constraint (3f and 3g) led to an increase in the inhibition of GSK3 phosphorylation in BT474 cells over the simple linear side chain (12b). Incorporation of polar functionality into the aminecontaining side chain, as exemplified by 14b, was detrimental to cell activity overall. As these compounds were shown to inhibit AKT-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3 in BT474 cells, they were also tested

for their ability to inhibit cellular proliferation.7 In fact, 3b-d,g,h and 14a inhibited proliferation of BT47426 and LNCaP27 cells with submicromolar IC50 values. The antiproliferative effects of these compounds against human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells were also measured and used as a surrogate for general cytotoxicity, as these are nontumor derived cells. Although the aminoethyl side chain analogue 3c was potent in the BT474 and LNCaP proliferation assays, it exhibited a poorer window of selectivity against HFF cells. Therefore, compound 3g was selected for further profiling, as it represented the best combination of cellular potency and selectivity within this set of analogues. Biochemical Characterization of 3g. To estimate the selectivity of 3g, we measured its ability to inhibit >250 in vitro expressed human protein kinases in either activity assays or binding assays.16,28 IC50 values were generated against 95 kinases. Kinases with IC50 values less than 100 nM are shown in Table 5. Compound 3g is very selective for the AKT isoforms

versus the majority of kinases in other families. It is also selective against some members of the AGC kinase family such as MSK1, ROCK1, and RSK1 but less so for other AGC kinases including PKA, PrkX, and PKC isozymes. The poorer selectivity for PKA, PrkX, and the PKC isozymes was not entirely surprising on the basis of the high degree of homology in the ATP binding pocket within these kinases. Other kinases inhibited by 3g are AMPK and DAPK3 from the CAMK family and PAK4, 5, and 6 from the STE family. Some kinase inhibitors exhibit time-dependent or slow onset of inhibition of their target enzymes due to either slow on- or off-rate for binding.14 The potency of such inhibitors can be grossly underestimated if the time-dependent inhibition is not properly accounted for.15,32 To capture potential time-dependent inhibition, our normal IC50 assays included a 30 min incubation of enzyme and compound prior to the initiation of the reaction with substrate addition.16 To understand whether 3g inhibits the AKT enzymes in a time-dependent fashion, IC50 values were determined with and without a 30 min preincubation step and found to decrease by 12- and 20-fold upon incubation with AKT1 (Figure 3A) and AKT2,33 respectively. Because of the time dependence of inhibition, 3g was tested for reversibility by rapidly diluting the E-I complex into a high concentration of ATP. Full activity was recovered with half-life values for dissociation of 38 and 30 min for AKT1 (Figure 3B) and AKT2,33 respectively. To probe the mechanism of inhibition with respect to ATP, steady state IC50 values were found to increase linearly with the ATP concentration; this pattern is consistent with an ATP competitive mechanism of inhibition for AKT1 (Figure 3C) and AKT2.33 As 3g is a potent inhibitor of AKT1 and AKT2 and since a nominal concentration of 10 nM AKT1 or AKT2 was used in the IC50 assays, it was not clear whether the potency determined for 3g reflected the fraction of the kinase that was capable of binding to the inhibitor or the true potency of the compound. By use of an assay format with lower concentration of the AKT

enzymes (0.33, 1, and 0.2 nM of AKT1, 2, and 3, respectively) and a 1 h incubation, the Ki* of 3g was determined to be 1, 4, and 13 nM toward AKT1, 2, and 3, respectively. The Ki* values determined for AKT1 and AKT2 were within 3-fold of their IC50 values, indicating that the IC50 values represented the true potency of this compound rather than the active fraction of enzyme. Compound 3g was also tested against the mouse AKT1 and 2 enzymes and was found to have very similar potency as against the human enzymes (data not shown).

Crystallography. Compound 3g was successfully cocrystallized within the kinase domain of AKT2 (148-481).34 The overall conformation of AKT2 in this structure is very similar to that of the kinase domain of activated AKT containing a S474D mutation (PDB code 1o6k).24 As predicted from the docking studies, 3g occupied the ATP binding pocket, making a key hydrogen bonding contact between N5 of the oxadiazole moiety and the backbone NH of Ala232 in the hinge binding region of AKT2 (Figure 4). Another key feature is an intramolecular hydrogen bond between N3 of the imidazopyridine ring and the exocyclic NH of the oxadiazole ring, keeping the two

fashion when analyzed 4 h following ip dosing in SCID mice (Figure 5A). Dose dependent increases in blood glucose and insulin levels were also observed. We believe that this was due, in part, to the potent inhibition of AKT2 by 3g, as this AKT isoform has been implicated in glucose homeostasis.29 In a separate experiment, 3g was found to significantly decrease GSK3 phosphorylation in BT474 tumor for up to 8 h after single ip dose in SCID mice at 20 mg/kg (Figure 5B). Furthermore, daily dosing of 3g (ip, 30 mg/kg) resulted in 64% inhibition of tumor growth compared to vehicle treated mice in BT474 xenografts. Details of the in vivo characterization of 3g in xenograft models are described in a separate publication.16 Pharmacokinetic profiles of 3g in rat, dog, and monkey were determined. Although 3g had poor oral exposure in all three species, blood concentrations of approximately 3 µM could be achieved following iv administration of the compound (Table 6). We have previously reported that this concentration of 3g correlated with a sustained decrease of GSK3 phosphorylation in BT474 tumor xenografts.16 Compound 3g is also soluble in aqueous buffer (>5 mg/mL, sodium acetate buffer in 5% mannitol, pH 4). Therefore, an iv formulation of 3g was selected for evaluation in patients with solid tumors or hematological malignancies. Conclusion In summary, we have described novel pyridylimidazoleoxadiazolyl amines as potent inhibitors of AKT1, 2, and 3. AKT kinase potency and selectivity were optimized guided by insights gleaned from a docking model of the lead structure 1 in AKT2. The validity of this model was subsequently verified by solving a cocrystal structure of 3g bound within the kinase domain of AKT2 (148-481). Inhibition of AKT activity by 3g was manifested in cells by the inhibition of phosphorylation of a downstream substrate of AKT (GSK3 ) and inhibition of proliferation in cells with activated AKT. In immune compromised mice implanted with human breast carcinoma (BT474) xenografts, a single intraperitoneal administration of 3g inhibited GSK3 phosphorylation in the tumor in a dose- and timedependent manner. In addition, GSK3 phosphorylation in BT474 tumor xenografts showed >60% decrease for up to 8 h following a single dose of 20 mg/kg. Repeated daily ip administration of 3g produced significant delay in tumor growth in mice bearing established human BT474 breast carcinoma xenografts.16 Compound 3g is currently in clinical development as an iv agent for use in patients with solid tumors or hematological malignancies.

rings coplanar with respect to each other. The glycine rich loop (residues 158-165) is tucked down over the plane of the imidazopyridine ring, maximizing hydrophobic interactions between the kinase and the inhibitor. The piperidinyl side chain of 3g is engaged in a hydrogen bond with the carboxylic acid side chain of Glu236 found in the substrate binding area. Another important interaction was the hydrogen bonding network between the backbone NH of Phe294 and the side chain carboxylic acid of Glu200 with the alkynol -OH. Interestingly, this hydroxyl group appears to have displaced a water molecule present in published structures of AKT2 crystallized with the nonhydrolyzable ATP mimetic AMP-PNP.24 We speculate that the ability of 3g to displace this water molecule may contribute to the observed time-dependent inhibition. In Vivo Characterization of 3g. In vivo characterization of 3g showed that this compound effectively inhibited GSK3 phosphorylation in BT474 xenografts in a dose dependent

Determination of TimeDependent Inhibition of 3g against Human AKT1 and 2. To determine whether 3g exhibits time-dependent inhibition, a filterbinding assay was used to measure IC50 values with and without a 30 min preincubation step of inhibitor with AKT1 and 2 prior to the start of the reaction (preincubation). The final reaction conditions were 15 nM AKT1 or 10 nM AKT2, 1 µM AKT-tide peptide (sequence, biotin-ARKRERAYSFGHHA-NH2), 15 µM ATP, and 0.015 mCi/mL -33P-ATP in buffer A (25 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM CHAPS, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT) and various concentrations of 3g in 5% DMSO. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min for AKT1 and 5 min for AKT2 and then stopped with the addition of an equal volume of 1% H3PO4. The stopped reaction was transferred to phosphocellulose filter plates and washed 5 times with 100 µL of 0.5% H3PO4. Microscint20 cocktail was added to the dried filter plates, and the plates were read using a Perkin-Elmer Microbeta liquid scintillation counter. Determination of Off-Rates of 3g from Human AKT1 and 2. Compound 3g and AKT1 were incubated at 50 and 125 nM each in buffer A for 50 min at room temperature. Formation of the AKT2-3g complex was similarly carried out. This amount of 3g was found to be sufficient to achieve complete inhibition. The reaction was initiated by adding the complex of 3g and AKT1 or AKT2 to the substrate solution containing 10 µM Sox-AKT-tide peptide substrate and 1 mM ATP in buffer A. The recovery of enzymatic activity was measured in a continuous fluorescence detection assay.31 The phosphorylation of Sox-labeled AKT-tide peptide was quantified in an Envision 2102 instrument (PerkinElmer) using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 486 nm. The time course of the recovery of enzymatic activity following rapid dilution of a preformed enzyme and inhibitor complex was fitted to the following equation:32

y ) Vst +

Vi - Vs (1 - e-kobst) + background kobs

where Vi and Vs are the initial and steady state velocities of the reaction in the presence of the inhibitor, kobs is the apparent firstorder rate constant for the conversion from Vi to Vs, and t is time.

Mode of Inhibition of 3g toward ATP. The IC50 values for 3g were determined against AKT1 and AKT2 in a continuous fluorescence detection assay. Various concentration of ATP were tested with 2.5 nM AKT1 or 2 nM AKT2 in buffer A containing 10 µM Sox-AKT-tide peptide. Rates of catalysis were derived from the linear portion of the progress curves. Potency of Compound 3g (Ki*) Determined against the Human and Mouse Enzymes. Either AKT1 (final concentration 0.33 nM) or AKT2 (final concentration 1 nM) in buffer A was incubated with 3g at various concentrations for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by adding substrate mix in buffer A containing GSK3R peptide (Ac-KKGGRARTSSFAEPG-NH2, final concentration 10 µM), ATP (final concentration 50 µM), and -33PATP (final concentration 0.03 mCi/mL). After 120 min, the reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 1% H3PO4 and detected in the filter binding format as described above. Ki* values were calculated using the following equation:
