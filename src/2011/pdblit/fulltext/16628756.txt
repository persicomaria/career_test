The pH dependence of kcat/KM for TmGH1 is bell-shaped with a pH optimum around pH 5.8 (Figure 3); fitting to a bellshaped ionisation curve gives acidic and basic limb pKa values of 5.3 and 7.0, respectively. The pH dependence of 1/Ki for 3 and 4 closely mirrors that of catalysis, but with small alkaline shifts (Figure 3). The pH optimum for inhibition by 3 is around pH 6.6, with acidic and basic limb pKa values of 6.3 and 6.8, respectively, and the pH optimum for inhibition by 4 is around pH 6.8, with acidic and basic limb pKa values of 6.0 and 7.4, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 display similar inhibitory potential with Ki values, at the pH optimum of TmGH1 catalytic activity, of 2 mm for 3 and 4 mm for 4. At the pH optimum for inhibition, these Ki values are slightly lower (estimated to be 0.95 mm for 3 and 1.25 mm for 4). Slow onset inhibiFigure 1.

4 lacking a methylene group at the C6 position, the hydroxyl group at C5 is still able to hydrogen bond with Glu405, with little apparent movement of active-site residues. All other hydrogen bonds that are likely to represent a difference in the enthalpy of association are very similar in both complexes; the distortion of the ring in 3 allows an interaction between the endocyclic nitrogen atom and the nucleophile, but 4 is able to promote hydrogen bonds between its own endocyclic nitrogen atom and both the nucleophile and acid/base residues. Differences in solvent structure around the inhibitors, which would help to explain the different entropic contributions to binding between 3 and 4, are also not evident. However, ITC measurements reflect only half of an equilibrium and thus do not account for differences in water coordination between the ligands in free solution, which are extremely difficult to estimate. It is possible that the ring distortion displayed by 3 provides favourable interactions that contribute to the enthalpy term, but penalises the entropic contribution. In contrast, 4 is not distorted; this favours the entropic contribution to binding but other interactions in the active site may not be maximised. Compounds 3 and 4 have a similar potency against TmGH1, and are between three- and fourfold better inhibitors than 1, but considerably weaker than 2. It is interesting to note that 2 and 4, which have a nitrogen atom in the same position, both bind with large favourable entropic contributions; it is therefore the reasonably large favourable enthalpy term that gives Figure 2. Interactions between TmGH1 and A) 3 and B) 4. 2 the 50-fold greater potency over 4. Similar enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding are displayed by 1 and 3, which also possess a nitrogen atom in an equivalent position. The large entropic contribution to binding for both 2 and 4 might question their role as transition-state mimics, as transition-state binding should be dominated by enthalpy.[7, 8] The profiles for pH dependence of 1/Ki for 3 and 4 are very similar, unlike their thermodynamic parameters. The profiles are consistent with a protonated inhibitor binding to TmGH1 with one protonated and one deprotonated catalytic residue. This differs from 1 and 2, which appear to bind optimally to a largely inactive enzyme; here the catalytic residues are doubly deionised.[15] This means that, despite the similarities in the position of the endocyclic nitrogen atom for 1 and 3 and for 2 and 4, pH dependence can vary considerably. In summary, the binding of 3 and 4 to a family 1 glycoside hydrolase has been dissected by using structural, kinetic and thermodynamic methods.

Experimental Section
X-ray crystallography: The gene encoding TmGH1 was over-expressed, and the subsequent protein product was purified, as described previously.[15] Minute amounts of 3 (purchased from Sigma) or 4 (prepared by synthesis[21]) were added to the protein prior to crystallisation under the same conditions as the native protein.[15] Crystals were cryoprotected in a solution containing mother liquor with 25 % ethylene glycol, harvested into rayon fibre loops and flash frozen. Data were collected at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, on beamline ID14-1 for the complex with 3 and ID29 for the complex with 4. Data were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK in the HKL SUITE[22] (data quality statistics are shown in Table 2). Isomorphism between the native TmGH1 structure and the complexes meant refinement could commence following cycles of rigid body refinement in REFMAC[23] with the protein atoms only of PDB entry 1OD0. Models were refined by using iterative cycles of maximum likelihood methods in REFMAC[23] interspersed with manual corrections of the model and addition of water molecules in COOT.[24] All crystallographic manipulation used the CCP4 suite of programs.[25] Idealised coordinates for 3 and 4 were generated by using the CHARMm program integrated into QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and dictionaries for refinement created with the MONOMER LIBRARY SKETCHER program in CCP4.[25] Five percent of the observations were set aside at the beginning of refinement and used to monitor refinement strategies.[26] Models were validated by using PROCHECK,[27] and the coordinates were deposited with the Macromolecular Structure Database at the European Bioinformatics Institute (http://autodep.ebi.ac.uk); final refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. Kinetics: Kinetic studies were conducted by monitoring the change in UV/visible absorbance with a Cintra 10 spectrophotometer equipped with a Thermocell Peltier power supply. All experiments were performed at 25 8C. kcat/KM dependence on pH for TmGH1 was measured by substrate depletion methods at a substrate concentration lower than the KM. Reactions were carried out at pH values ranging from pH 4 to 8 with sodium citrate buffer (100 mm, pH 4 to 6) and sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 6 to 8). All assays contained 2,4-dinitrophenyl b-d-glucopyranoside (15 mm) as substrate and bovine serum albumin (1 mg mL¿1; except at pH values below pH 5 at which it precipitates) in a total volume of 1 mL. The reaction was initiated by addition of TmGH1 (10 mL) to a final concentration of 3.4 nm. 2,4-dinitrophenolate release was monitored continuously at 400 nm for 600 s. Data were fitted to a first-order rate equation [Eq. (1)] by using GRAFIT[28] to give Vmax/KM, which could be adjusted for the enzyme concentration to obtain kcat/KM. Data at different pH values were fitted to a bell-shaped ionisation curve [Eq. (2)].

ting to a first-order rate equation was not possible, and thus Ki values were determined by monitoring the rates directly under steady-state conditions at low substrate concentration in the presence (vi) and absence (v0) of inhibitor. Assays contained the same components as described for the kcat/KM determination with the addition of 3 (between 250 nm and 20 mm) or 4 (between 250 nm and 50 mm). Reactions were initiated by addition of TmGH1 (10 mL) to a final concentration of between 2.5 and 9.1 nm. Rates were monitored for 300 s, unless slow onset inhibition was observed, in which case reactions were allowed to run for longer. Rates were taken as the slope of the line between 200 and 300 s or in the linear region following slow onset inhibition. The fractional decrease of v0/vi for each inhibitor was calculated by using Equation (3), and the mean Ki value was taken. The dependence of 1/Ki on pH was fitted to a bell-shaped ionisation curve. v 0 =vi º 1˛ΩI=K i 3ﬁ

Isothermal titration calorimetry: ITC was performed on a VC calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA, USA) at 25 8C. TmGH1 was dialysed into sodium citrate buffer (100 mm, pH 5.8) by using a 10 kDa cut-off polythersulfone membrane concentration device (Vivascience, GÁttingen, Germany) to a final concentration of between 85 and 95 mm for titrations with 3 and 187 mm with 4. Compounds 3 and 4 were diluted in the same buffer to final concentrations of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively. Samples were spun and degassed prior to use. Titrations were performed by injecting aliquots (10 mL) of the inhibitor into TmGH1. The stoichiometry (n) between protein and each inhibitor was assumed to be 1 (as the titration curves were well defined and was further substantiated by visualisation of the inhibitor with TmGH1 by X-ray crystallography), and the ligand concentration was altered accordingly. Data were corrected for heats of dilution by subtracting the excess heat at high molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme. The enthalpy (DH8a) and equi-

The Gibbs' free energy (DG8a) and entropy (TDS8a) were calculated by using Equation (4). All measurements were made in duplicate and averaged.
