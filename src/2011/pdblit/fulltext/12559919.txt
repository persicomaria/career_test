IMP dehydrogenase: structural schizophrenia and an unusual base
Lizbeth Hedstrom1 and Lu Gan2
Textbooks describe enzymes as relatively rigid templates for the transition state of a chemical reaction, and indeed an enzyme such as chymotrypsin, which catalyzes a relatively simple hydrolysis reaction, is reasonably well described by this model. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) undergoes a remarkable array of conformational transitions in the course of a complicated catalytic cycle, offering a dramatic counterexample to this view. IMPDH displays several other unusual mechanistic features, including an Arg residue that may act as a general base catalyst and a dynamic monovalent cation site. Further, IMPDH appears to be involved in 'moonlighting` functions that may require additional conformational states. How the balance between conformational states is maintained and how the various conformational states interconvert is only beginning to be understood.

for antimicrobial and antiparasitic chemotherapy, although such drugs have yet to be developed. The structure and medicinal chemistry of IMPDH inhibition has received attention in several recent reviews [3­11]. IMPDH mechanism was last reviewed in 1999 [12]. The current review focuses on investigations of the structure and mechanism of IMPDH from the past three years. However, it would be remiss to overlook the emerging evidence that this protein has additional cellular functions. First, IMDPH binds nucleic acids and is associated with RNA in cell lysates [13,14]. Second, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa is caused by mutations in human IMPDH type I. These mutations do not perturb IMPDH activity, but do perturb the affinity and specificity of nucleic acid binding and may also cause protein aggregation [15­19]. IMPDH is phosphorylated, although the functional consequences of this modification are unknown [20]. Lastly, IMPDH associates with lipid vesicles, again with unknown consequences [20] (see also Update). The elucidation of such novel cellular functions of IMPDH promises to be exciting.

An underlying mechanistic link between inhibitor affinity and catalysis
Like aldehyde dehydrogenase, IMPDH catalyzes two very different chemical transformations: first, a redox reaction that produces NADH and a Cys-linked covalent enzyme intermediate E­XMP*; and second, a hydrolysis reaction that releases XMP (Figure 1a). Substrates add randomly, but NADH must be released before E­XMP* can hydrolyze (Figure 2). The hydrolysis step is at least partially rate-limiting [21], so E­XMP* is the predominant enzyme form, and therefore the easiest target for inhibitors. MPA traps the E­XMP* intermediate, binding in the nicotinamide subsite after NADH departs [22,23]. Thus mycophenolic acid (MPA) is an uncompetitive inhibitor; the efficacy of MPA and similar inhibitors is maintained as IMP concentrations increase within a cell, which is a great advantage over more conventional competitive inhibitors. As enzymes go, mammalian IMPDHs, with values of kcat $0.4 sÀ1, are embarrassingly slow; bacterial IMPDHs are much faster, with kcat values $10 sÀ1. MPA is a potent inhibitor of the slow mammalian IMPDHs but a poor inhibitor of the fast bacterial enzymes, suggesting that there is an underlying mechanistic link between drug affinity and catalysis [12,24]. Obviously, the formation and decomposition of E­XMP* will control MPA affinity as well as the value of kcat. But what explains the more

Introduction
The oxidation of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) is the pivotal step in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis (Figure 1a). This reaction occurs with the concomitant reduction of NAD+ and is catalyzed by IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). The guanine nucleotide pool controls proliferation and many other important cellular processes. IMPDH controls the size of the guanine nucleotide pool, which makes this enzyme an attractive target for immunosuppressive, antiviral and cancer chemotherapy. Several drugs targeting IMPDH are currently in use, including CellCept (a mycophenolic acid prodrug), mizoribine, ribavirin and tiazofurin (Figure 1b), several other IMPDH inhibitors such as VX-944 and benzamide riboside are promising, and new pharmacophores are under development [1,2]. IMPDH might also be a target

rapid hydrolysis of E­XMP* on a bacterial IMPDH? Further, mizoribine monophosphate (MZP), the active metabolite of mizoribine, displays the opposite selectivity -- it is a more potent inhibitor of bacterial IMPDHs, although this selectivity is not sufficient for therapeutic applications. Curiously, the affinity of MZP decreases in

parallel with activity in various IMPDH mutants [25]. This behavior is usually observed in transition state analogs, although MZP does not recapitulate the tetrahedral geometry expected for the transition state of the IMPDH reaction. How does MZP resemble the transition state?

Figure 2

The kinetic mechanism and conformational transitions of the IMPDH reaction. Although substrates associate randomly, only the pathway where IMP binds first is depicted for clarity. The Cys319 loop and the flap are disordered in apoenzyme, as denoted by the dashed lines. When IMP binds, the loop becomes more ordered. NAD+ binds and the dehydrogenase reaction occurs rapidly to produce E­XMP*NADH. K+ is believed to stabilize the loop in E­XMP*, although when- and how- K+ associates with the enzyme is not known. The release of NADH is slower than hydride transfer and can be partially rate limiting in bacterial IMPDHs. Inhibitors such as MPA can bind to the vacant NADH site of E­XMP*. Alternatively, the flap folds into the NADH site, positioning Arg418 to activate water. This conformational change is believed to be rapid. The hydrolysis of E­XMP* is rate-limiting, and is believed to trigger the release of K+ and the opening of the flap and loop. www.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2006, 10:520­525

522 Mechanisms

The transition state analogy of MZP
Both conundrums were resolved with the solution of the EMZP complex of T. foetus IMPDH [26]. MZP, the active site Cys319 (T. foetus IMPDH numbering) and a water molecule are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry resembling the transition state (Figure 3e). Modeling a purine ring in place of the imidazole base of MZP, the water is poised to attack C2, with Cys on the other side as would be expected of the leaving group. Thus the EMZP complex does indeed resemble the transition state for the hydrolysis reaction. This structure also captured a new closed conformation that is required for hydrolysis of E­XMP*. IMPDH forms a homotetramer with four active sites. The IMP site and the nicotinamide subsite are embedded within a monomer whereas the adenosine subsite is found at the subunit interface. A loop covers the IMP and nicotinamide sites, but the distal portion of this segment (hereafter termed the flap) is disordered in most structures of IMPDH (Figure 3). In the EMZP complex, the distal flap folds into the dinucleotide site, forming contacts with the same
Figure 3

residues that bind NADH and MPA (Figure 3e) [26]. Two flap residues, Arg418 and Tyr419, interact with the putative catalytic water, suggesting that one or both of these residues can act as a general base catalyst. Mutation of Arg418­Tyr419 impairs the hydrolysis of E­XMP* but has no effect on the dehydrogenase half reaction [27]. Therefore, while the open conformation is required for NAD+ binding and the dehydrogenase reaction, the closed conformation is necessary for the hydrolase reaction, so that the conformational change must occur in midcatalytic stream.

The dynamics of drug selectivity
MPA and the flap compete for the NADH site, and this competition controls both drug selectivity and the hydrolysis of E­XMP*. The human enzyme favors the open dehydrogenase conformation, which accounts for MPA sensitivity, MZP resistance and low kcat. Bacterial enzymes favor the closed hydrolase conformation, and are thereby MPA-resistant, MZP-sensitive and fast. The equilibrium between open and closed conformations appears to be determined by interactions between the

Conformational transitions in IMPDH. The following complexes of T. foetus IMPDH are shown: (a) ESO42À (PDB accession number 1AK5), model for apoenzyme [31]; (b) EIMP (1ME9) [34]; (c) EIMPTAD (1LRT), model for EIMPNAD+ [32]; (d) ERVPMPANa+ (1ME7) [33]; (e) EMZPK+ (1PVN), model for E­XMP*closed [26]; (f) EXMP [31].

flap and the adenosine subsite. Despite the functional constraints imposed by dinucleotide binding and the conformational transitions, the sequences of these segments diverge to the extent that they are often difficult to align. Therefore, the adenosine site presents a promising target for isozyme-specific inhibitors and one promising design strategy is to extend MPA to interact with the adenosine subsite [3]. Interestingly, the S. cerevisiae E­ XMP*MPA complex has unique mobility in gel electrophoresis, perhaps reflecting the conformational change induced upon MPA binding [28]. The interplay between the open and closed conformations is further illustrated with the selection of a MPA-resistant variant of Candida albicans IMPDH [29]. This enzyme contains a single mutation, Ala251Thr, near the NADH site that shifts the equilibrium to the closed conformation, rendering the enzyme resistant to MPA, but super-sensitive to MZP. The importance of position 251 in MPA sensitivity is also apparent from characterization of the three IMPDH isozymes in S. cerevisiae [30]. Thus, drug selectivity and catalytic prowess are largely consequences of the different dynamic structural properties of various IMPDHs.

as well as a C-terminal helix from the adjacent subunit. A second potassium site is observed in T. foetus IMPDH, but this site is not conserved [32,33]. Stabilization of the Cys319 loop provides a ready explanation for potassium activation. However, steric hindrance between Cys319 and IMP will prevent the loop from assuming the potassium binding conformation; indeed, the cation is only observed in the E­XMP* complex, where Cys319 and the purine ring are attached by covalent bond, and in complexes with IMP analogs that lack the six-membered ring of purine bases. The Cys319 loop is found in conformations that cannot bind potassium in EIMP and ternary complexes that resemble EIMPNAD+ [32,34] and is disordered in structures of the ESO4À2 and EXMP [31]. These observations suggest that the potassium binding site may be formed concomitantly with E­XMP*, so that potassium stabilizes the E­XMP* and the hydrolysis of E­XMP* triggers the release of potassium. These observations suggest a novel mode of allosteric activation, whereby potassium assumes a dynamic role, perhaps associating and dissociating during the catalytic cycle, permitting the enzyme to transiently access different conformations for each step.

The structural dynamics of the catalytic cycle
With the recent proliferation of IMPDH structures, EIMPTAD, EMZP, including ESO42À, EIMPMPA, EXMPNAD+, EIMP, ERVPMPA of T. foetus IMPDH (Figure 3), we now possess snapshots of complexes that mimic almost every step along the catalytic cycle, with the notable exceptions of unliganded enzyme and ENAD+ [26,31­34]. Glossing over differences in the primary structures of IMPDHs from different sources as well as potential artifacts arising from oxidation of Cys residues during crystallization, these structures suggest that IMPDH undergoes a remarkable array of conformational contortions during the course of a catalytic cycle (Figures 2,3). Two mobile elements stand out: the loop containing Cys319 and the flap containing Arg418­ Tyr419. Both segments appear to be unconstrained in the absence of substrates. The Cys319 loop is found in at least three different conformations depending on the occupancy of the dinucleotide site (Figures 3c­e). In particular, the positions of Thr321 and Arg322 vary dramatically, pointing into the active site in some conformations and out to solvent in others. Clearly, the presence of Arg322 will have profound consequences for the electrostatic potential, and thus the reactivity, of the active site.

Arg as a general base
As discussed above, the structure of the EMZP complex suggests that the Arg418­Tyr419 dyad activates water. Mutations of these residues selectively perturb the hydrolysis step, leaving the dehydrogenase step unscathed [27,35]. Of course, these mutations could disrupt the conformational change as well as the chemical transformation. Indeed, these mutant enzymes bind inhibitors such as MPA with higher affinity than wild-type, indicating that the conformational equilibrium (Kc) has shifted toward the open conformation. The perturbation of Kc can be estimated from inhibitor analysis, which in turn allows the calculation of the effect on the hydrolysis of E­ XMP*. Such experiments suggest that the Tyr419 contributes relatively little to the activation of water [27]. In contrast, substitutions of Arg418 destabilize the closed conformation, but have an even larger effect on hydrolysis. These observations suggest that Arg418 acts as the general base in the IMPDH reaction. Interestingly, Arg appears to function as a base in several other enzymatic reactions [35]. Different substitutions of Arg418 have strikingly different consequences [35]. The Arg418Ala mutation both destabilizes the closed conformation and cannot hydrolyze E­XMP*. The Arg418Gln variant also cannot hydrolyze E­XMP*. However, unlike Ala, the closed conformation is favored and modeling studies suggest that Gln can recapitulate two of the hydrogen-bonding interactions of Arg418. This observation indicates that closure does not require a positive charge at position 418. In contrast, the Arg418Lys variant does not close very often, but when closure occurs, E-XMP* hydrolyzes

The dynamic nature of monovalent cation activation
All IMPDHs are activated by potassium and similar monovalent cations, yet cations are observed in only a handful of X-ray crystal structures: the E-XMP*MPA, EMZP and ERVP complexes [23,26,33]. Here, cations are bound at each subunit interface, forming interactions with mainchain carbonyls in the Cys319 loop

efficiently. Modeling suggests that Lys can reach the catalytic water, but can only make one of the other hydrogen bonds associated with Arg418, consistent with the observation that the closed conformation is less stable. The activity of the Arg418Ala variant can be rescued with guanidine derivatives [36]. Rescue increases with pH, as expected if the guanidine derivates serve as general bases. Unfortunately, only five rescue agents can fit into the cavity created by the Ala substitution. The resulting Brønsted plot, although clearly not definitive, suggests that the proton has mostly transferred from water to Arg418 in the transition state. The pH dependence of the IMPDH reaction suggests that a residue with pKa $8 modulates kcat [35]. The pH dependence of the conformational change also displays a pKa $8. These ionizations are not affected by the substitution of Tyr419. In contrast, the conformational change becomes pH-independent when Arg418 is substituted with Gln. The simplest explanation for these observations is that Arg418 is the residue with pKa $8, although the kinetically equivalent mechanism whereby Arg418 remains protonated while water deprotonates is also consistent with all of the experimental observations.

aggregates do not appear to be associated with intracellular organelles. Restoration of the guanine nucleotide pool by the addition of guanosine dissociates the aggregates. The authors also observe MPA-induced aggregation with purified IMPDH in vitro, although the relevance of this observation is unclear because substrates seem to have been omitted from the experiments, so the EXMP*MPA complex could not form. GTP reverses aggregation, apparently by binding to IMPDH, thus providing evidence for previously unsuspected feedback regulation. Another recent paper from Chong et al. [39] makes the surprising observation that the type I isozyme is an antiangiogenic target, thus challenging the prevailing view that the utility of IMPDH inhibitors in cancer chemotherapy would be improved with specific inhibitors of the type II isozyme.

How is the pKa of Arg418 perturbed?
The structure of the EMZP complex offers few clues. While Arg418 is no longer exposed to solvent, there are no neighboring positively charged residues, and the environment does not appear especially hydrophobic. Arg418's nearest neighbors include Asp261 and several water molecules. Of course, if the EMZP complex mimics transition-state structure, and the proton has already transferred in the transition state, then Arg418 should be protonated. Perhaps Arg418 encounters different residues when it enters the active site; as noted above, the structural plasticity of the Cys319 loop can drastically alter the electrostatic properties of the active site.

Conclusions
The rigid transition state template model of enzyme catalysis fails to describe the astonishing ability of enzymes to direct complicated reaction sequences. Such processes require the enzyme to access a collection of conformational states that facilitate different chemical transformations. In addition, many enzymes have 'moon-lighting` functions that require additional conformational states. Far from being a mere curiosity, IMPDH provides a tractable system to investigate how proteins efficiently manoeuvre between conformations and offers a paradigm for understanding much more complex biochemical processes.
