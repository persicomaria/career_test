SUMMARY

The ssh gene of Haemophilus infiuenzae was cloned and sequenced. identity with the Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli SSB proteins, to complement an E. coli ssb-1 mutation.

INTRODUCTION

The ssb gene of Escherichia coli encodes an essential protein of 177 aa (hil, 18 843) which functions in DNA replication, repair and recombination (see, for review, Meyer and Laine, 1990). Recently, the ssb gene of Serratia marcescens was identified by virtue of its ability to complement an E. coli ssb mutation and the S. marcescens SSB protein was shown to possess 89% aa identity with the SSB of E. coli (de Vries and Wackernagel, 1993). Genes encoding SSB homologues have also been identified and sequenced from bacteriophages T7 and IKe (Dunn and Studier, 1981; Peeters et al., 1983) the transmissible plasmids RK2, plP7la, plP23la, R64, ColIb-69

(Jovanovic et al., 1992; Ruvolo et al., 1991; Howland et al., 1989), and the F sex factor (Chase et al., 1983). The aim of this study was to determine the nt and deduced aa sequences of the Haemophilus injuenzae ssb gene and its product. Furthermore, we tested the ability of the H. injuenzae ssb gene to complement an E. coli ssb mutation.

(a) Cloning and sequencing of the H. influenzae ssb gene A plasmid, designated pGJ300 (Fig. l), consisting of a 3.6-kb EcoRI fragment of H. injuenzae chromosomal DNA inserted into the shuttle vector pLS88 (Willson et al., 1989), was originally isolated by virtue of its ability to complement a mutation affecting heme utilization in H. injkenzae, and shown to carry the H. injluenzae tonB gene (Jarosik et al., 1994). This 3.6-kb fragment was subcloned into the phagemid pBluescriptI1 SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and nested deletions were sequenced. In addition to an ORF encoding the H. injiuenzae tonB gene, sequence analysis of this fragment also indicated two additional ORFs, one complete and one partial, which encoded products homologous to E. coli proteins involved in DNA metabolism.

complete ORF likely encoded the H. irzfluenme SSB homologue. Similarly to the E. co/i SSB, Gly was the most abundant aa. Both upstream and downstream from this ORF were regions of complete or interrupted dyad symmetry, the functions of which are not known (Fig. 2). (b) Analysis of nt sequences upstream from ssb Immediately upstream from the H. i~~jlumzue ssh gene, but on the opposite strand, a partial ORF (Fig. 1) encoded a deduced product of 358 aa (M, 39 883) possessing 83% aa identity to the E. co/i UvrA protein (M, 103 874; Husain et al., 1986). Part of this sequence is shown in Fig. 2. including a region of the N terminus exhibiting homology to the `A-type' ATP-binding site (GLSGSGKSSLAFDTL) found in the N terminus of the E. co/i UvrA protein (Husain et al., 1986). Similarly to E. coli (Brandsma et al., 1983 ) and S. mawcscms (de Vries and Wackernagel, 1993), the H. it$uenzae .s.sh and wrA gene homologues share a divergent promoter region which includes several regions of interrupted and uninterrupted dyad symmetry (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the promoter region contains nt sequences homologous to the LexA protein-binding site (i.e., SOS box; Little and Mount, 1982), suggesting the H. influenxc
