3-Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a typical kinase with two structural domains. The domains each bind one of the two substrates, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and MgATP. For the phospho-transfer reaction to take place the substrates must be brought closer by a hinge-bending domain closure. Open and closed structures of the enzyme with different relative domain positions have been determined from different species, but a comprehensive description of this conformational transition is yet to be attained. Crystals of pig muscle PGK in complex with MgADP and 3-phosphoglycerate were grown under the conditions which have previously resulted in crystals of the closed, catalytically competent conformation of Trypanosoma brucei PGK. The X-ray structure of the pig muscle ternary Ê complex was determined at 1.8 A and the model was re®ned to R  20.8 % and Rfree  24.1 %. Contrary to expectation, however, it represents an essentially open conformation compared to that of T. brucei PGK. In addition, the b-phosphate group of ADP is mobile in the new structure, in contrast to its well-de®ned position in T. brucei PGK. An extensive comparison of the ternary complexes from these remote species has been carried out in order to establish general differences between the two conformations and is reported here. A second pair of the open and closed structures was also compared. These analyses have made it possible to de®ne several characteristic changes which accompany the structural transition, in addition to those identi®ed previously: (1) the operation of a hinge at b-strand L in the inter-domain region which greatly affects the relative domain positions; (2) the rearrangement and movement of helix 8, regulated through the interactions with the nucleotide phosphate; and (3) the existence of another hinge between helix 14 and the rest of the C-terminal part of the chain, which allows ®ne adjustment of the N-domain position. The main hinge at b-strand L acts in concert with the C-terminal hinge at helix 7 described previously. Simultaneous interactions of the nucleotide phosphate groups with the loop that precedes helix 8, b-strand J and the N terminus of helix 13 are required for propagation of the nucleotide effect towards the b-strand L molecular hinge. A detailed description of the role of nucleotide binding in the hinge operation is presented.

Structural basis of domain movements

Introduction
Relative movement of protein domains has often been deduced from structural studies (see, for example, Zhang et al. (1995) and reviews by Gerstein & Krebs (1998); Gerstein et al. (1994); Hayward (1999); and Wriggers & Schulten (1997)). Domain ¯exibility seems to be essential for various reactions catalysed by enzymes; these include several members of the kinase family, a ubiquitous group of enzymes (Matte et al., 1998). However, the structural principles that govern domain motion are not always understood. Attempts have been made to classify the motion at the level of supersecondary structure (e.g. by de®ning hinges or rotational axis). However, there are not many detailed descriptions of these large-scale conformational changes in terms of side-chain and backbone interactions. 3-Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a monomeric enzyme (molecular mass $ 45 kDa) with two well-separated structural domains of about equal size (Banks et al., 1979; Blake & Rice, 1981; Watson et al., 1982). PGK is an essential enzyme for the basic metabolism of various living organisms: glycolysis of aerobes, fermentation of anaerobes and carbon ®xation of plants. It catalyses the phosphotransfer from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to MgADP to form 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and MgATP. Due to the instability of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the reverse reaction is usually investigated. Crystallographic studies have shown that 3-PG binds to the N-terminal, while the nucleotide substrate MgATP, or the product MgADP, binds to the C-terminal domain (Banks et al., 1979; Watson et al., 1982; Harlos et al., 1992; Davies et al., 1994). There are several pieces of evidence which suggest movement of the two domains during the catalytic cycle, bringing the two substrates into close proximity for catalysis and thus allowing a direct phospho-transfer between them. Early crystallographic studies of horse (Banks et al., 1979), yeast (Watson et al., 1982), pig (Harlos et al., 1992; May et al., 1996) and of the bacterial Bacillus stearothermophilus (Davies et al., 1994) PGKs, however, showed the enzyme in the open conformation. The ®rst crystallographic indication of PGK domain Ê mobility came from the 2.0 A resolution structure of a binary complex with 3-PG, which showed a domain rotation of only about 8o (Harlos et al., 1992). Structural evidence for more complete domain closure of PGK has only recently been provided by two independent crystallographic studies of PGK from two independent species: Trypanosoma brucei (Bernstein et al., 1997) and a thermophilic bacterium, Thermotoga maritima (Auerbach et al., Ê 1997). The 2.5 A resolution structure of T. brucei PGK complexed with 3-PG and MgADP (Bernstein & Hol, 1998), showed the molecule in a fully closed conformation, accomplished by a domain rotation of about 32o. The transferring phospho-group could be modelled into the active site, in agreement with the assumed direct in-line phospho-

Ê transfer (Bernstein et al., 1997). The 2.0 A resolution structure of T. maritima PGK complexed with the substrate 3-PG and MgAMP-PNP, an analogue of the substrate MgATP, showed the enzyme in a similar, but not completely closed conformation (Auerbach et al., 1997). In the above reports, important structural elements involved in domain motion have been identi®ed. From the study of T. brucei PGK, two independent hinge points (called C and N-hinges) have been noted at the ends of helix 7 which connects the two domains, as has slight bending of this helix (Bernstein et al., 1998, 1997). Small shifts of two other helices in the inter-domain region have also been observed: helix 14 relative to the N-terminal domain and helix 13 relative to the C-terminal domain. In the structure of T. maritima PGK, a reorientation of the loop between helix 14 and the connecting b-strand L has been observed and is thought to be an element of the close contact formation of the two domains that completes the catalytic site (Auerbach et al., 1997). While these results provide direct structural evidence for domain closure, several questions remain unanswered: (1) what is the relationship, if any, between operation of the hinge-points at the ends of helix 7 and the reorientation of the conserved active site loop between helix 14 and b-strand L; and (2) what structural changes direct such movements, which occur far away from the substratebinding site? In order to answer these questions, a detailed comparison of the open and closed conformations is required. For the pig muscle enzyme, we have previously determined a partially closed structure of a binary Ê complex with 3-PG at 2.0 A resolution (Harlos et al., 1992), as well as the structure of a pseudoternary complex obtained upon diffusion of the nucleotide analogue MnAMP-PNP into the crystal of this binary complex (May et al., 1996). The ternary complex was similar to the binary complex except for some local conformational changes. The relative orientation of the two domains remained unchanged, possibly due to the crystal contacts which may have prevented the occurrence of any large-scale structural changes. Here we grew crystals of a ternary complex of the pig muscle enzyme in the presence of 3-PG and MgADP, using the same conditions that have previously produced crystals of T. brucei PGK ternary complex in the closed conformation. The aim was to make a systematic comparison of the binary (open) and ternary (presumably closed) complexes of pig muscle PGK, i.e. to compare different conformations of the enzyme from the same source, since sequence differences of up to 50 % exist between PGKs from different sources. (Watson & Littlechild, 1990; Fleming & Littlechild, 1997). We also wished to compare the structures of PGK-ternary complexes from these different sources, in order to identify their species-independent common features.

501 the place of MgADP and electron densities could be well assigned to all three phosphate groups of the nucleotide (May et al., 1996). Apart from this, the positions and the interactions of the adenine, ribose and the a-phosphate group of the two different nucleotides are largely similar in the new and in the previous pig muscle ternary complexes (Figure 3(b) and (d)). The mobility of the b-phosphate group of ADP is perhaps coupled with the uncertainty in the assignment of the magnesium ion, which is known to form a complex with the nucleotide phosphate Ê groups. The 1.6 A resolution structure of the binary complex of B. stearothermophilus PGK with MgADP (Davies et al., 1994) showed that Mg2 forms a well-de®ned bridge between two phosphate O atoms of ADP and Asp Bs352 (equivalent to Asp374 of helix 13){. A similar observation has been made of the interactions of Mg2 in the ternary complex of T. brucei PGK with MgADP and 3-phosphoglycerate (Bernstein et al., 1997) (Figure 3(c)). In the present structure of pig muscle PGK, there is density in the neighbourhood of the Asp374 carboxyl oxygen atom and the nucleotide a-phosphate group, which has been tentatively assigned to a Mg2 (Figure 3(a) and (b)). No atoms could be found inside the known co-ordination Ê sphere of this Mg2, i.e. within 2.0-2.2 A (Harding, 1999). The nearest phosphate group oxygen atom Ê of ADP is at 2.99 A. Therefore, this density is more likely to be that of a water molecule than a magnesium ion. Thus, although pig muscle PGK and T. brucei PGK have been crystallised under similar conditions, the structures show differences in both their overall conformation and in the details of the nucleotide binding. The open conformation is the most surprising aspect, as the simultaneous binding of 3-PG and MgADP has failed to force the enzyme to adopt a closed conformation. It is worth noting that the pig muscle enzyme has yet to be crystallised in a closed catalytic conformation. In all the pig muscle PGK structures determined so far, the distances between the two bound ligands are larger than those in the closed ternary molecules (cf. Figure 2(a) and (b)). The primary sequences of T. brucei and T. maritima PGKs, both observed in their closed conformations, differ by up to about 50 % from the muscle enzymes, although the tertiary structure of PGK is highly conserved during evolution (Mori et al., 1986; Watson & Littlechild, 1990; Fleming & Littlechild, 1997). The sequence differences may in¯uence the state of the equilibrium between the open and closed states, by stabilising one conformation over the other through formation of different protein-protein contacts in the crystal lattice. On the other hand, dynamic light-scattering studies with solubilised pig muscle PGK have shown that the presence of both substrates stabilises a more compact protein conformation, compatible with the assumed closed conformation (Sinev et al., 1989).

Results and Discussion
Crystal structure of the new PGK ternary complex: open conformation is associated with the mobility of the nucleotide b -phosphate group Crystals (space group P21) of pig muscle PGK were grown in the presence of the substrate 3-PG and the product MgADP. X-ray diffraction data from these crystals have led to a re®ned structure Ê of a ternary complex, PGK*3-PG*MgADP, at 1.8 A resolution with R  20.8 % and Rfree  24.1 %. The gross features of the ternary complex molecule, determined here, are shown in Figure 1(a) together with the arrangement of secondarystructural elements and the positions of the bound substrates, which are similar to the known PGK structures. The sequence as deduced from the present X-ray data is compared with some other known sequences of PGK (Banks et al., 1979; Harlos et al., 1992; May et al., 1996) in Figure 1(b). The most remarkable feature of the new ternary PGK structure is the open domain conformation, an unexpected characteristic compared to the closed conformation of T. brucei enzyme (Bernstein et al., 1997; Figure 2(a) and (b)). However, as expected, the substrate (3-PG) and the nucleotide bind to the N and C-terminal domains, respectively (cf. Figures 1 and 2). The open conformation of the new structure and the binding mode of 3-PG are very similar to the previous structure of pig muscle PGK pseudo-ternary complex with MnAMP-PNP and 3-PG (May et al., 1996). For comparison, another closed structure of the ternary complex of T. maritima PGK with MgAMP-PNP and 3-PG (Auerbach et al., 1997) is also shown in Figure 2 and represents an intermediate state between the pig muscle and T. brucei PGK structures. All atoms of the bound 3-phosphoglycerate could be built into the electron density map. At the nucleotide site on the C-domain, no density could be seen for the b-phosphate group of ADP. At low contour levels (0.6-0.7 s) of the map, there is an indication of a possible O-P bond to this b-phosphate group, but nothing beyond. AMP could be well modelled into the observed density with several bound water molecules around it (Figure 3(a)). However, the presence of ADP in the crystal has been con®rmed by enzymatic determination (cf. Materials and Methods), implying that the b-phosphate group of ADP must be mobile in this ternary complex. This is in marked contrast to the wellde®ned position of the nucleotide phosphate groups in its T. brucei counterpart (Bernstein et al., 1997). The previously determined pig muscle PGK ternary complex contained bound MnAMP-PNP in

503 with the enzyme in the two states and (3) if possible, to describe the effect of the substrate interactions on the conformational state of the hinge(s). The structures are compared in the following pairs: Pair 1, pig muscle (current work, open) and T. brucei (closed) PGKs complexed with MgADP and 3PG and crystallised in the presence of phosphate; Pair 2, pig muscle (open) and T. maritima (closed) PGKs, another pair of ternary complexes, but with Mg (or Mn) AMP-PNP instead of MgADP and crystallised in the presence of PEG. New features of domain closure have emerged from these comparisons and are outlined below. A new important hinge at b strand L A superimposition of all four PGK ternary complexes optimising the alignment of the backbone atoms of the core b-strands in the N and C-terminal domains, respectively, is shown in Figure 2(a) and (b). The conformation of each individual domain, except for a few source-speci®c insertions, is similar in all structures even when the relative domain positions are widely different. Thus, the domains move almost as rigid bodies relative to each other. Of the two known hinge points at the ends of helix 7 suggested previously (Bernstein et al., 1997), only the conformation of the C-hinge is signi®cantly different in the open and the corresponding closed ternary structures (Figure 2(a)). This is con®rmed by the r.m.s. deviation data of the superimposed helix 7 plus C-domain core b-strands which are much higher than the respective data obtained by separate superimposition of these structural elements (Table 1). Much smaller differences were observed in the data when helix 7 and the N-domain core b-strands were chosen for superimposition, which indicated that in all four ternary complexes the N-hinge is similarly closed (cf. Figure 2(a)). In addition to these hinges at each ends of helix 7, we have observed the presence of another important hinge operating in b-strand L, as illustrated in Figure 2(b). This strand connects helices 13 and 14, and is situated between the two domains. Helix 13 constitutes an integral part of the C-terminal domain, while helix 14 moves together with the N-terminal domain. These features are supported by the r.m.s. deviation data obtained from superposition of the respective structural elements (Table 1) which show that the relative movement of helices 13 and 14 is as large as the relative movement of the C and N-terminal domains observed when their core b-strands were superimposed. A smaller movement of helices 13 and 14 relative to the C-terminal and N-terminal domains, respectively, can be also deduced from the r.m.s. data in Table 1, in agreement with previous observations (Bernstein et al., 1998). The relative movement of helices 13 and 14 is depicted in Figure 4(a) and (b), which also show the domain rotations by movements of the respect-

The bound ligands are shown as stick models. In (a) the interdomain helix 7, and in (b) the b-strand L, are highlighted by ribbons of the respective colours.

However, all PGK species should temporarily adopt both open and closed conformations in solution during the catalytic cycle. The hinges which are operational during the domain movement should therefore be present in all the species, irrespective of the differences in sequence. Here, we compare two pig muscle ternary complexes with corresponding closed structures from remote species and our aims are as follows: (1) to locate all the hinges involved in the transition between the open and the closed states, (2) to identify differences between the interactions of the substrates

ive core b-strands. b-Strand L, which connects these two helices, must therefore undergo a large conformational change. The r.m.s. deviation data (Table 1), support the existence of a signi®cant hinge at this location. Â In addition, through modelling studies (Szilagyi et al., unpublished results), we have observed that the particular backbone conformation of the interdomain region which is characteristic of the closed PGK molecules, and consists of part of helix 13 and the b-strand L, can position the two domains closer together. However this modelling has also demonstrated quite clearly that without operation of the hinges at helix 7, the polypeptide chain would break. Therefore the new hinge region at bstrand L and the known hinges at helix 7 must act in concert, and both regions have important roles in the positioning of the two domains. Rearrangement and motion of helix 8 Superimposition of all four PGK structures to optimise the alignment of various structural elements of the two domains and of the inter-

domain region (Figure 4) has led to other new observations. It is notable that all the relevant parts, highlighted by the ribbons, are well separated into pairs according to the basic conformational state of the molecule. The operation of the new putative hinge point in b-strand L results not only in the movement of helix 14, but also of the remaining part of the C-terminal end of the chain (helix 15 and the C-tail). This is clear in (Figure 4(a)), where the molecules are superimposed according to helix 13. The C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain (residues 398-416) including helices 14 and 15 constitutes an integral part of the N-domain. This feature of the PGK molecule has been known for a long time, but the role it plays in the folding process (Mas et al., Â 1995; Ritco-Vonsovici et al., 1995; Szilagyi & Vas, 1998) or in the function (Ritco-Vonsovici et al., 1995; Zomer et al., 1998) has not yet been properly understood. This type of structural organisation has often been observed in proteins and has general importance in enhancing domain-domain interactions (Schleif, 1999).

Figure 4(a) shows that helix 13 undergoes a conformational change at its N terminus, which is located close to the bound nucleotide phosphate groups, and the implication of this change is discussed below. At the same time the whole of helix 13 is shifted relative to helix 14 when the molecules are superimposed according to helix 14 (Figure 4(b)). Helix 8 moves considerably relative to the C-domain. Superimposition, optimising the overlap of the core b-strands of the C-domain (Figure 4(c)), clearly indicates that helix 8 moves more or less independently of this domain, although it constitutes an integral part of the C-domain (cf. also r.m.s. deviation data in Table 1). The pronounced movement of helix 8 occurs at a hinge between its N terminus and the C terminus of b-strand G, which connects helices 7 and 8. The operation of this hinge is directly mediated through an interaction with the nucleotide, as shown below. The known C-hinge of helix 7 is situated at the N terminus of b-strand G and thus may be indirectly affected. It is also evident from Figure 4(d) that helix 8 undergoes substantial conformational changes, especially in its N-terminal part located close to the bound nucleotide. The superimposition, optimised for the C-terminal part of helix 8, shows clearly that the ®rst turn of this helix is better formed in the closed structures, but that the rest of it is more ordered in the open structures. The hydrogen bonds along this helix are signi®cantly weaker in both closed structures, resulting in an elongation of the helix as a whole, in spite of the fact that its ®rst turn has became more ordered.

Helix 8 also moves relative to helix 14 (Figure 4(e)). This motion brings helix 8 of the C-domain into a position more parallel with helix 14 (which belongs to the N-domain) and thus the open channel between the two domains can be closed by complementary side-chain interactions, as we have already proposed (May et al., 1996). From the superimposition which optimises the overlap of helix 14, an additional hinge has been observed between this helix and the rest of the C-terminal part. The C-tail, including helix 15, moves together with the core b-strands of the N-domain, while helix 14 does not completely follow this motion (Figure 4(e)). Thus, in addition to the new hinge point at b-strand L, which is mainly responsible for directing the relative domain positions, two hinge points have been described in this section: one associated with the loop between b-strand G and helix 8 and the other located between helix 14 and the short helix 15 at the C terminus of the molecule. These two hinge points play an important role in closing the channel between the domains.

Different interactions of the substrates in the open and closed states Understanding the spatial changes of the key secondary structural elements mentioned above at the level of side-chain interactions would provide information on the molecular mechanism of the domain closure. We have thus analysed the enzyme-substrate interactions.

Superimposition of the four PGK ternary complexes: current structure (pig1, red), pseudo-ternary complex (pig2, orange), Tb (green) and Tm (blue) according to the peptide backbone atoms of (a) helix 13, (b) and (e) helix 14, (c) the core b-strands of the Cdomain and (d) the C-terminal half of helix 8. For clarity, only the investigated secondary-structural elements are shown by ribbons of the same colour code and the bound ligands are also shown as stick models.

The interactions of 3-PG with protein side-chains of the N-domain are very similar in all four complexes, in agreement with the observation that the extent of closure at the N-hinge of helix 7 is almost the same. One noticeable exception in the open structures is the absence of a 3-PG interaction with the conserved Lys215 in the C-domain. In the closed structures Tb219/Tm197 interacts with 3-PG as a consequence of the domain closure and has been reported earlier (Auerbach et al., 1997). At the nucleotide binding site in the new structure, we have shown above that the ADP b-phosphate group is mobile. We presume that this mobility of the ADP b-phosphate group is related to the present open conformation of the molecule, stabilised by the lattice forces in the crystal. In comparison between the two pairs of known structures in open and closed conformation, there is a remarkable difference in the hydrogen-bonding network which mediates interactions of the nucleotide with the loop preceding helix 8. In the closed PGK structures of T. brucei (Figure 3(c)) and T. maritima (Figure 3(e)), the peptide amide N atom of Ala Tb218/Tm196 forms three H-bonds; one with the O atom of the nucleotide ribose, one with the phosphate group ester oxygen atom linked with the C5H atom of the ribose and one with the nucleotide a-phosphate group. These interactions are either absent or very weak in both the open pig muscle PGK structures (Figure 3(b) and (d)), and also in the open structure of B. stearothermophilus

PGK (Davies et al., 1994; not shown). From the discussion above, helix 8 has been seen to be important in closing the open channels between the two domains. In the closed structures, therefore, this hydrogen-bond network may play a role in the movement of helix 8 and consequently in the positioning of the conserved Lys215 closer to the phosphate group of 3-PG. For the closed structure of T. maritima PGK, strong interactions of the nucleotide g-phosphate group with NZ of Lys Tm201 (helix 8) and with ND2 of Asn Tm317 (b-strand J) have been observed (Figure 3(e)). Equivalent interactions are much weaker in the corresponding open structure of the pig muscle PGK pseudo-ternary complex (Figure 3(d)). Other interactions of the nucleotide with the PGK molecule are found to be unaffected by the state of domain closure. The hydrogen-bonding of the b-phosphate group O atoms to Asp374 (Tb377/ Tm355) peptide amide N, as well as to the amide N and OH of Thr375 (Ser Tb378/Ser Tm356) do not change during domain movement. These conserved residues belong to helix 13. Further, the hydrogen-bond between an O atom of the a-phosphate group and Lys219 (Tb223 and Tm201) from helix 8 is present in all of the known PGKnucleotide complexes, though it is relatively weak Ê (3.48 A) in the pig PGK pseudo-ternary complex (Figure 3(d)).

507 Gly Tb375/Tm353 (another member of the Gly triplet) and the conserved Ser Tb401/Tm379 (OG) from helix 14 in the closed structures (Figure 5(b)); helix 14 moves away from helix 13, towards bÊ strand L, by at least 2 A, and allows the formation of a new hydrogen bond in both the closed structures. In T. brucei PGK the new bond is formed between Ser Tb401 (OG) of helix 14 and Ser Tb395 (OG) of b-strand L, and in T. maritima PGK it is between Gly Tm353 (N) of helix 13 and the peptide O atom of Ser373. This results in a new conformation of b-strand L at its C terminus in the closed structures and consequently the connecting hydrogen-bond system between b-strands K and L, that precede and follow helix 13, respectively, becomes more extended (not shown), as has been noted (Bernstein et al., 1997; Auerbach et al., 1997). Figure 5(c) provides further insight into the possible connection with the other hinges at helix 7 and with the other substrate (3-PG) site on the Ndomain. In the T. maritima structure, as has been noted (Auerbach et al., 1997), the multiple hydrogen-bond interactions of the conserved Glu Tm174 of helix 7 with Ser Tm373 (OG), as well as with Thr Tm374 (OG1 and N) are disrupted, but they all exist in the other closed structure of T. brucei PGK as well as in both open structures. It seems that T. maritima PGK represents a unique case among the four ternary complexes. This is also re¯ected in the differing interactions of the conserved Arg Tm36. This arginine residue is important with respect to the connection of the two domains of the enzyme and it directs the carboxylic group of 3-PG for the reaction (May et al., 1996). The NH group of this residue forms a permanent hydrogen bond with Thr Tm374 (O) (not shown), as observed in the other three structures too, independent of their overall conformations. However, the second hydrogen bond between Arg Tm36 (NE) with the same Thr Tm374 (O) does not exist in T. maritima PGK. Instead, the NE atom forms a new, weak hydrogen bond with Thr Tm374 (OG1). These changes, when considered in conjunction with the other differences between the two closed structures (e.g. the existence of a hydrogen bond between Ser Tb401 (OG) and Ser Tb395 (OG) only in T. brucei but not in T. maritima PGK) indicate that this part of the molecule is certainly very mobile during catalysis. The hydrogen bond between these two conserved serine residues, as well as the hydrogen-bond network linking Ser392Glu192-Thr393-Arg38, are under continuous rearrangement in a concerted way. However, one feature is clear: in all these ternary complexes Arg38 always remains connected to, and moves along with, b-strand L when the conformation of the molecule is changing. In summary, we present here the ®rst complete molecular description of an important hinge that operates at b-strand L of PGK. In the ternaryenzyme-substrate complexes, the conformation of this hinge is indirectly affected by the nucleotide substrate, through well-de®ned changes in the

We suggest here that the relative positions of helix 8 and helix 13 can be regulated through formation of these simultaneous contacts with the nucleotide. During domain closure the N termini of these two helices not only move closer to each Ê other by between 1 and 2 A, but are also modi®ed by noticeable conformational changes, as shown in Figure 4. Propagation of the nucleotide effect towards the main hinge point We now investigate the consequences of the nucleotide interactions with the two helices 8 and 13 described above, and show how these changes are transmitted towards the new hinge at b-strand L. Valuable insight is provided by comparing the interactions that exist among the side-chains located near the nucleotide phosphate groups (Figure 5) in the open and closed structures. First, the hydrogen bond between the conserved Lys Tb223/Tm201 (NZ) from the N terminus of helix 8 and Asn Tbr338/Tm317 (OD1) from a core b-strand (J) of the C-domain exists only in the closed structures (Figure 5(a)). Due to the formation of this hydrogen bond, the salt bridge of Lys Tbr223/Tm201 with Asp Tbr222/Tm200 is disrupted, although it remains intact in the open structures. Also, new hydrogen bonds are formed in the fully closed structure of T. brucei PGK, between the peptide N atom of Lys Tb223 and the peptide O atoms of both Lys Tb219 and Asp Tb222. The distances between the equivalent atoms in the T. maritima PGK are also reduced compared to the open structures, and are not much longer Ê (only 0.5-0.8 A) than the length of ordinary hydrogen bonds. Conversely, the hydrogen bond between Lys219 (NZ) and the peptide O atom of Lys215, observed in the new pig ternary structure (Figure 3(a)) does not exist in any of the closed structures. These changes greatly in¯uence the conformation of the polypeptide chain at and near the N terminus of helix 8. As Asn Tb338/Tm317 forms simultaneous contacts with both Lys Tb223/Tm201 (NZ) and the nucleotide phosphate group, it moves closer to the N terminus of helix 13 (which is in direct contact with the nucleotide) and forms a hydrogen bond with the peptide O atom of Gly Tb374/Tm352 (Figure 5(a)), i.e. with one member of a conserved GlyGlyGly triplet. This hydrogen bond is well formed in the fully closed T. brucei PGK structure, but is relatively weak in the partially closed structure of T. maritima PGK. The conformation of the N-terminal end of helix 13 is dramatically changed as a consequence. The new conformation is further stabilised by an additional hydrogen bond between Gly Tb374/Tm352 (O) with Ser Tb378/Tm 355 (OG1), a partially conserved side-chain that is replaced by a threonine residue in the pig enzymes. This leads to the disruption of the hydrogen bond between the peptide amide group N atom of

stored as a microcrystalline suspension in the presence of ammonium sulphate and 2 mM dithiothreitol. For crystal growing, the enzyme was dialysed in 30 mM NaK-phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Single crystals were grown at 15  C within a few weeks in hanging drops (10-15 ml each) initially containing 1.25 M NaK-phosphate (pH 8.0), 100 mM 3-PG, 25 mM MgCl2, 20 mM ADP, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02 % (w/v) NaN3 and 15 mg/ml PGK. Reservoir solutions contained 2.42.75 M NaK-phosphate (pH 8.0). These conditions were essentially similar to those described by Bernstein & Hol (1998) for the crystallisation of T. brucei PGK, except that the substrate concentrations were chosen to be higher in order to prevent their partial replacement by phosphate ion present in the crystallisation medium. Crystals of the ternary complex were obtained. The cell parameters (Table 2) are within 1 % of those of pig muscle PGK crystals grown in the presence of ammonium sulphate (A. May et al., personal communication). Determination of the ADP content A small volume of MgADP was taken from the crystallisation mother liquor and the concentration was determined with a coupled enzymatic assay using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (Tompa et al., 1986).

interactions of conserved side-chains. No such changes can be attributed to the previously described hinges at the ends of helix 7. Therefore, although all the hinges must act in concert, the hinge at b-strand L may play a direct role in determining the relative positions of the two domains of this enzyme. Several questions still remain. For instance: (1) why is the nucleotide substrate alone not able to induce such a conformational change in the binary complex; (2) what is the mode of operation of the N-hinge of helix 7; and (3) is the mobility of the bphosphate group of ADP, observed here, associated with the transient changes in the interaction of the nucleotide substrate with PGK during the catalytic cycle? Answers to these questions require an extension of the comparison of all known PGK structures to include the binary complexes, as well as the substrate-free enzyme.

Crystals were ¯ash-frozen (Garman & Schneider, 1997) into a gaseous nitrogen stream held at 100 K. Prior to cooling, the crystal was soaked for two minutes in a solution containing mother liquor and 15 % (v/v) glycerol to provide cryoprotection. X-ray data were collected from a single crystal on beam-line 7.2 (l  1.488 mm) at SRS, Daresbury, UK. A MarResearch imaging plate detector of diameter 300 mm was used, positioned 130 mm from the crystal, and the resolution at the edge Ê of the detector was 1.79 A. An oscillation angle of 1  per image was used. The data were processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996) and were Ê 96 % complete to 1.8 A resolution. Table 2 summarises the data collection and model re®nement statistics. The starting model was chosen as the structure of the MnADP binary complex of pig muscle PGK crystallised in the presence of ammonium sulphate (A. May et al., personal communication). Re®nement was carried out in È cycles of the XPLOR package (Brunger, 1992) together with manual rebuilding of the model at the end of each cycle using O (Jones et al., 1991). The primary sequence of horse muscle PGK was used as in all previous models of pig muscle PGK. A random set of re¯ections (5 %) was excluded from the re®nement and was used to calculate Rfree. Initially, the two domains (residues 1-188 and 202-392) were re®ned as rigid objects in order to determine their relative orientation (R  37 %, Rfree 37 %). The 2FoÀFc and FoÀFc maps calculated at this stage clearly showed the positions of the bound substrates and the open conformation of the enzyme. This was followed by cycles of positional re®nement, simulated annealing and restrained isotropic temperature factor (B) re®nement. After each cycle of B-factor re®nement, the model was inspected and adjusted to the electron density maps. In general, the maps showed good density for most parts of the molecule and for the substrates, except for a few loop regions, the N terminus and the b-phosphate group of bound ADP. After the

510
®rst cycle of re®nement, substrate molecules 3-PG and AMP (in place of ADP) were included in the model. Water molecules were added to the structure in stereochemically acceptable positions using Waterpick (in XPLOR), but those which subsequently re®ned with Ê B-factors above 50 A2 were deleted from the model. Bulk solvent corrections were applied at a later stage in the re®nement and the lower resolution limit of data Ê included in the re®nement was extended from 8 A to Ê 20 A. In total, 91 % of the non-glycine and non-proline residues were in the most favourable region of the Ramachandran plot and the rest were in the additional allowed region (PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993)). There were several deviations observed from the known horse muscle sequence and these are highlighted in Figure 1(b). Among them the following are notable, since a larger residue was identi®ed in place of a smaller one: Ser69 (Gly), Lys147 (Glu), Lys182 (Gln), Ala186 (Gly), Lys262 (Ala), Gln294 (His), Ile297 (Thr), Pro317Lys318 (Thr-Glu), Ser324 (Ala) and Leu413 (Ala); the residues in parentheses are those present in the horse structure. We believe that these represent real differences in sequence between the pig and horse muscle PGKs and they are underlined in Figure 1(b). Some of the residues which were treated as alanine in the previous pig structure (May et al., 1996) could also be identi®ed correctly. While most of these were found to be identical with the horse sequence, there were exceptions, such as Gly68 (Val), and Gln349 (Arg). For some residues, the sequence in the pig (May et al., 1996) was found to be the same as that of the horse muscle enzyme (Banks et al., 1979). However, in our structure the density corresponded to Ê Ala, both in the low-resolution and the 1.8 A map. These residues were mostly on the surface and they have been retained as Ala in the ®nal structure (e.g. 29-31 (LysAsn-Asn), 102 (Glu), 155 (Lys), 198-200 (Lys-Ala-Leu), 260 (Glu), 299 (Gln) and 321 (Lys)). For molecular graphics, the Insight II 95.0 software (Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA) was used. X-ray co-ordinates of PGK from pig muscle in complex with 3-PG and MnAMP-PNP (May et al., 1996), from T. brucei (Bernstein & Hol, 1998) and from the bacterium T. maritima (Auerbach et al., 1997) were kindly provided by the authors before publication.
