Although bonding networks determine electron-transfer (ET) rates within proteins, the mechanism by which structure and dynamics influence ET across protein interfaces is not well understood. Measurements of photochemically induced ET and subsequent charge recombination between Zn-porphyrin-substituted cytochrome c peroxidase and cytochrome c in single crystals correlate reactivity with defined structures for different association modes of the redox partners. Structures and ET rates in crystals are consistent with tryptophan oxidation mediating charge recombination reactions. Conservative mutations at the interface can drastically affect how the proteins orient and dispose redox centers. Whereas some configurations are ET inactive, the wild-type complex exhibits the fastest recombination rate. Other association modes generate ET rates that do not correlate with predictions based on cofactor separations or simple bonding pathways. Inhibition of photoinduced ET at <273 K indicates gating by smallamplitude dynamics, even within the crystal. Thus, different associations achieve states of similar reactivity, and within those states conformational fluctuations enable interprotein ET.

CcFe(II) and Trp of compound I (19). Thus, when comparing relative ET rates for different CcP:Cc complexes, ET to an acceptor center that includes both the Zn-porphyrin and Trp-191 must be considered (Fig. 1). To better reconcile structural perturbations with reactivity, we have measured photochemically initiated ET reactions between Zn-porphyrin-substituted CcP (ZnCcP) and site-directed mutants of yCc in single crystals and determined structures of the complexes by x-ray diffraction. Whereas substitutions of Cc Phe-82 to either Trp (CcW) or Ser (CcS) largely retain the interaction with ZnCcP observed for the WT Cc, substitutions to both Tyr (CcY) and Ile (CcI) change how the proteins associate. These structurally distinct complexes, as well as an additional configuration provided by horse Cc (hCc) in complex with yeast ZnCcP complex (21), all have similar ET reactivity despite considerably different donor-toacceptor distances and intervening structures. The ET properties of the four Phe-82 Cc variants with CcP contrast with that of the WT complex and that of the F82Y K72S yCc double mutant, which exhibit much higher and much lower reactivity, respectively.

any long-range electron-transfer (ET) reactions in biology occur across transient protein­protein interfaces. Reaction rates depend on factors that control both electron tunneling and conformational dynamics coupled to protein association processes (1­3). As such, interprotein ET is sensitive to structure and dynamics at the interface (1, 4­11). Residue substitution (achieved either by use of protein homologs, site-directed mutants, or computations) has been a popular and powerful approach for probing how interface composition influences interprotein ET (7, 10­14). Nevertheless, effects of residue variation on interface structure are not often known. The natural redox partners yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and yeast cytochrome c (yCc), whose structure as a complex was first determined in 1992 (15) and later as a covalent complex (16), have served as a paradigm for studying interprotein ET reactions (8, 17). Hoffman and colleagues (8) have exploited ZnCcP substitution to photoactivate ET reactions and examine the effects of many structural and chemical perturbations on interprotein ET. In this system, the ZnCcP triplet state (3ZnCcP) reduces Fe(III)Cc, and then back ET recombines the charge separation (Fig. 1). Recently, it has been demonstrated that a Trp-191 3 Phe CcP variant has much slower ET back-rates (keb) than wild-type (WT) CcP in the 1:1 complex with yCc (18). Thus, electron hopping through Trp-191 may accelerate the recombination reaction (Fig. 1), in analogy to the natural reaction between CcP compound I and Fe(II)Cc (19). Nevertheless, much slower ET back-rates in the complex between CcP and hCc compared with yCc, both in solution (20) and in crystals (21), indicate that ET across the protein­protein interface limits the overall rate. Because of their close proximity, Zn(II)porphyrin and Trp likely equilibrate rapidly compared with the interprotein ET step. Consistent with fast equlibration between Zn(II)porphyrin and Trp , reduction of Zn(II)porphyrin in crystals depends on the contact with the Cc donor (21) and produces much slower interprotein ET than that observed between

Temperature Dependence of Crystal ET. Temperature was regulated by adjusting the flow of cold nitrogen stream from boiling liquid nitrogen with Cryostat (MSC, The Woodlands, TX) and read with a thermocouple mounted on a goniometer (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA) at the crystal position. Measurements were obtained at 10­20°C temperature intervals beginning at 178°C. During a measurement, the temperature was maintained to within 5°C.

In the latter cases, yCc was placed manually in electron-density maps. Rigid-body, positional, and thermal factor refinement was implemented with CNS (26), amidst rounds of manual rebuilding, Zn-protoporphyrin incorporation, and water placement with XFIT (27). TLS parameters for the translation, liberation, and screw-rotation displacements of a pseudorigid body were refined in REFMAC (28) to generate the final models (Table 2).

Transient absorption spectroscopy was carried out with a custombuilt microspectrophotometer, as described in ref. 21. Kinetic traces were fit to exponential-decay processes by nonlinear least-squares (ORIGIN 7, Microcal, Amherst, MA). Although signals were followed for both intermediates [Fe(II)yCc at 520 nm and ZnCcP at 680 nm], because of better signal-to-noise ratio, the progress curves at 680 nm were used to describe the rate constants. Data are presented from a representative experiment, although rate constants are given as averages from multiple (more than three) crystals. Crystals were reduced to Fe(II)Cc by titration with increasing amounts of dithionite to evaluate natural 3ZnCcP decay constants. Formation of the charge-separated intermediate, [ fi(exp( kpt) ZnCcP , was fitted to the function A(t) i i i exp( kebt)) (keb kp)] A3exp( kpt), where i 1, 2; keb is the intracomplex Fe(II)Cc to ZnCcP ET rate constant for phase i; fi is the fractional weight of each kinetic phase; and A3 accounts for changes in triplet state absorption (29). If 3ZnCcP transfers electrons with a rate constant ke to an Fe(III)Cc bound, then the factor is given by ke [3ZnCcP(0)], where ke is the forward ET rate is the difference in extinction coefficients of the constant, intermediate and ground state at wavelength , and [3ZnCcP(0)] is the initial concentration of 3ZnCcP produced by the laser photolysis.

Results and Discussion
Structures and Redox Properties of ZnCcP in Complex with yCc Phe-82 Mutants. Highly conserved Cc Phe-82 lies adjacent to the heme and

contributes 13.0 Å2 of buried surface area to the interface with CcP. Mutations at Phe-82 modestly affect yCc stability, structure, and redox potential (33­35) and reduce rates of back ET from Fe(II)Cc to ZnCcP in comparison with WT Cc (12). We mutated Phe-82 of yCc to Tyr, Trp, Ser, and Ile and determined the crystallographic structures of all four variants in complex with yeast CcP (Table 2). The resolution of the structures (2.3­3.0 Å) and large anisotropic B-factors associated with the Cc molecules indicate that some of the complexes are not highly ordered (Table 2). Nevertheless, Fo Fc omit maps confirm the positions of each heme, and thus the relative molecular orientations in each complex are well determined (see Fig. 5, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Consistent with previous reports (33), these mutations produce only minor perturbations of Cc potential and apparent reorganization energy when analyzed by protein-film voltammatry (Table 3); however, in some cases the binding affinity to ZnCcP decreases by 10­100 fold (Table 1). Surprisingly, whereas CcW and CcS maintain the same contact with CcP as the WT (1,208 Å2 buried surface area), CcY and CcI bind CcP through a completely different interface (803 Å2). Relative to the WT Cc:CcP complex, CcY(I) rotates by 90° and translates by 8 Å (Fig. 2 A and B). In the WT complex, Cc binds CcP with regions that surround the Cc heme and involve loops preceding and following the His-18 and Met-80 axial heme ligands, respectively (Fig. 2B). In the altered complex, only the Cc loop preceding Met-80 (residues 75­84) interacts with CcP (primarily on the 193­209 loop and 226­229 -hairpin; Fig. 2B). It is not obvious why the CcY(S) variants prefer the altered binding interaction, although substitutions at residue 82 do influence the order of the immediate C-terminal loop that would interact with CcP in the WT orientation. Moreover, the new orientation generates a much longer donor-to-acceptor separations

than in the WT complex (Table 1). We assume that the asymmetric units represent the interactions that dominate ET between molecules in the lattice; all other cofactor separations in the crystals are at least 8 Å larger than those discussed.
ET Kinetics in Crystals. The ET kinetics and relative reactivity of all

four Cc Phe-82 mutants (Table 1) agree remarkably well with previous solution studies of the same variants (12). Thus, the crystal associations likely represent the 1:1 complexes formed in solution. ke (Fig. 1), it has been difficult to unambiguously Because keb resolve a transient charge-separated intermediate for the WT ZnCcP:yCc complex in solution (29) and crystals (21). However, in crystals of CcW and CcS, a subtly altered interface slows back ET to within an observable regime (Fig. 3). In these variants, ZnCcP and Fe(II)Cc form at the rate expected for 3ZnCcP quenching and disappears with multiphasic kinetic phases, whose major components are indeed rapid (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Notably, keb has decreased compared with WT Cc in the CcW complex even though the substitution induces only small changes of side-chain and solvent molecule positions at the interface. The ET rate constant between Fe(II)Cc and Trp-191 of CcP compound I in the WT complex [2 106 s 1 (19)] significantly exceeds the largest components of keb observed for these mutant crystal complexes (2­4 103 s 1). However, if ZnCcP and Trp-191 equilibrate rapidly in the back reaction, the ratio of [Trp ] to [Zn-porphyrin ] will downweight the effective rate 1 constant for ET to Trp-191 from Fe(II)Cc. Comparison of keb for ZnCcP in complex with the Phe-82 mutants (Table 1) to the value for ET to compound I suggests that only 0.1% of the radical is localized at Trp-191 . It follows that an 180 mV difference in the redox potentials separates Trp and Zn-porphyrin , which is consistent with previous estimates of these and related potentials 1 (29, 36, 37). Nonetheless, if keb represents a pure ET tunneling rate in all of these complexes, a much greater difference in this quantity would be predicted by the structures of the CcW(S) and CcY(I) complexes (Table 1). As seen in solution studies of these systems (12), all of the mutant
In

support of redox participation by Trp-191 in the recombination reaction, the structure of the CcP W191F mutant in complex with yCc has no significant structural differences compared with the WT (data not shown).

2 complexes have a variable slow phase (keb 30­70 s 1, f2 0.08­0.22) associated with the back ET process (Table 1). This slow phase could reflect direct Fe(II) to Zn-porphyrin ET, as seen in the CcP W191F mutant (18); however, short-circuit through Trp191 should greatly limit porphyrin­porphyrin ET, provided the porphyrin and indolyl radicals rapidly interconvert relative to the interfacial ET reaction. Alternatively, a subset of complexes has reduced ET reactivity in the crystal due to altered conformations. Interestingly, ET in CcS has the largest contribution from the slow phase ( f2 0.22) and also shows alternate associations within the asymmetric unit of the crystal (Fig. 2C). The two unique CcS complexes differ in their interface structure. Whereas one complex is well-ordered and has the WT association mode, difference electron-density maps reveal that the Cc heme and interface regions have shifted by 2.0 Å in the second complex (Fig. 2C). The second Cc molecule also has poor electron density in the peripheral regions, further suggesting variable positioning in the crystal. Thus, the crystal tolerates small rigid-body motions of the two redox partners, and the mutant where this behavior is most evident (CcS) also exhibits the largest contribution from slow back ET. Understanding the effects of these modest conformational changes on ET reactivity will likely require detailed computational studies. Although the altered binding modes of CcY and CcI complexes generate cofactor-to-cofactor separations that are 4­5 Å greater than the WT binding mode, the kinetics of ZnCcP and Fe(II) Cc decay parallel those of CcW and CcS (Fig. 3). Distance considerations or pathway calculations predict that electronic coupling between the cofactors in the two Cc association modes should be very different (Table 1). However, coupling in these systems could substantially increase if a tunneling pathway includes Lys-72, which is positioned to bridge a gap in the interface by hydrogen bonding to both proteins (Fig. 3). In the CcY structure, the average position of Lys-72 puts these interactions out of typical hydrogen-bonding range (3.4 and 3.6 Å, respectively), but in the CcI complex, multiple conformations for this residue are able to hydrogen bond with each side of the interface (see Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Hence, dynamics may allow sampling of these hydrogen bonds and increased donor-to-acceptor coupling in the CcY(I) complexes.

For the case of a rapidly equilibrating Zn-porphyrin

, Trp-191 pair, in the back ET reaction with Fe(II)Cc, both species will decay together with an observed rate constant (keb) that Zn W reflects back ET to the Zn-porphyrin (keb) and back ET to Trp-191 (keb) weighted by the Zn W equilibrium ratio ( fW), i.e., keb (keb) fW(keb). Because Fe(II) to Zn-porphyrin ET is slow in the CcP W191F mutant ( 70 s 1) (18), ET to Trp-191 should dominate the observed rate constant.

The F82Y, K72S Cc Double Mutant Decouples ET with ZnCcP. We further investigated the importance of Lys-72 in the CcY complex by mutating this residue to Arg, Gln, and Ser. In crystals of the double mutants, the forward 3ZnCcP quenching rate decreases, with the most dramatic effect from K72S, where the 3ZnCcP lifetime is essentially that of unquenched 3ZnCcP (kp 123 s 1).

(B) Relative positioning and interface structures for the ZnCcP:F82W yCc (Left) and ZnCcP:yCc F82I (Right) complexes. Cc (gray ribbons, top) rotates 90° and translates 8 Å in the F82I mutant generating altered heme orientations (yellow bonds), interprotein contacts (black and orange side chains), and intervening solvent structure (red spheres) with CcP (yellow, below) compared with the F82W complex. (C) Superposition of ZnCcP from the two ZnCcP: F82S yCc complexes (red and blue) indicate variability in Cc positioning within the asymmetric unit.

Crystals containing F82Y K72S Cc diffract poorly and only provide a 4.3-Å resolution structure for the complex with ZnCcP (Table 2). In the asymmetric unit, these crystals contain two molecules of ZnCcP and one partially disordered Cc. Nevertheless, electron density for the heme region and constraints of crystal packing allow a reasonable positioning of the molecule. Clearly, the association mode of Cc with ZnCcP has again been drastically altered by the additional substitution at Lys-72 (Fig. 2 A). In fact, lattice contacts prevent an association of Cc with CcP analogous to WT yCc or the CcY(I) variants. In agreement with no ET quenching of 3ZnCcP by F82Y K72S Cc, all Zn-porphyrin-to-Fe-heme distances in the crystal ( 39 Å) exceed the ET active configurations found in the other structures.
Distance Dependence of the Recombination Rates. If the ZnCcP:Cc association mode places the cofactors too far apart, as in the K72S mutant, there is no ET between the proteins. In contrast, when the proteins closely associate, as in the WT complex, keb increases to a value that prevents resolution of an intermediate. Inside these extremes, the yCc F82 single variants have intermediate values for keb that appear relatively insensitive to changes in the structure of

the complex (Table 1). Furthermore, the hCc:ZnCcP complex also 1 has keb similar to the yCcW(S):ZnCcP complexes, despite a much longer distance of separation between cofactors and commensurately lower predicted electronic coupling (Table 1). Additionally, rate constants for forward and back interprotein ET rates in a tuna ZnCc:Fe(III)Cc mixed crystal system are again similar to the F82 variants (38), even though structural considerations predict that they should be much larger (Table 1). Thus, static structures and simple bonding models cannot easily explain the relative reactivities of these various complexes.
Temperature Dependence of Forward ET in ZnCcP:yCc WT. Tempera-

ture dependence of the WT yCc:ZnCcP forward ET rates in crystals indicate that protein and or solvent motion gate the reaction. The quenching of ZnCcP by ET to Fe(III)Cc diminishes at 270 K in the crystal; within the error of our measurements, the decay curves appear monoexponential throughout this range (Fig. 4). By 170 K, the quenching rate reaches that of the Fe(II) Cc crystals or crystals of ZnCcP alone, indicating no ET (Fig. 4). This result somewhat contrasts the solution behavior (38), which also shows marked temperature dependence of the quenching constant; however,

quenching becomes nonexponential in a lower transition range that centers at 230 K. Comparisons of crystal structures at 100, 170, and 298 K show no noticeable differences at the resolutions of the structures (data not shown). Thus, the active states for forward ET are not likely represented time-averaged crystal structures and rather result from small-amplitude dynamic conversions, perhaps involving coupled protein, solvent, or proton rearrangements (1). At cryogenic temperatures, intraprotein ET rates in the microsecond or shorter time range do not diminish and can even increase (40, 41). Thus, fast ET within proteins does not appear to fall subject to the same dynamic constraints as some interfacial ET reactions.
Structural Perturbation and Gating for Interfacial ET. Insensitivity of

rates plateau in the same range that we observe for the ZnCcP:Cc complexes (200­5,000 s 1) (14, 42, 44, 45). The CcP:Cc crystal systems show that leveling behavior is an intrinsic property of interfacial protein ET and not unique to electrodes. At longer distances of separation however, ET reactions between Cc variants and carboxylic acid-terminated self-assembled monolayers do show marked sensitivity to the interactions that mate the protein to the electrode (14). In particular, substitutions of Lys-13 of rat Cc reduce ET rates by 5 orders of magnitude (14). Furthermore, cross-linked yCc at the CcP primary WT interface shows much higher ET reactivity than yCc cross-linked to the opposing back face of CcP, despite similar presumed cofactor separations (47). In our crystal systems, changes in orientation that should have such a dramatic change on the ET reactions [e.g., CcY(I) vs. CcW(S)], do not; yet very small changes in structure [CcW(S) vs. Cc WT] do slow the back rates to within an observable regime. Thus, electrochemical, solution, and crystal systems indicate that certain association modes are highly reactive, perhaps because they lock the system into well-coupled structures. Outside of these defined states, interfacial ET may not be particularly sensitive to changes in association because of limiting dynamics. For a solvent-damping mechanism (42) to explain the equivalent ET reactivity of the CcW(S) and CcY(I) crystal systems, the effective relaxation time for solvent protein modes to decouple the system would have to exceed 10 s, assuming the donor­acceptor coupling is 0.1 cm 1 (as is likely in the ZnCcP:Cc complexes).§ The source of such a slow process that would be common to the

At short distances ( 17 Å) ET rates between the metallo-cofactors and the electrode surface plateau. This behavior has been attributed to a number of mechanisms: (i) dynamic modes of the solvent or protein interior that damp motion along the ET reaction coordinate (so-called ``quantum friction'') (42); (ii) electrode-derived electric field effects that influence proton rearrangements (43); and (iii) larger amplitude gating processes that produce transitions between active vs. inactive states (44­46).

with eff being the characteristic relaxation time of the reaction coordinate. The adiabaticity parameter g is the ratio between the time the reaction coordinate spends in the crossing region to the time for an electron to transfer from donor to acceptor. Thus, if HAB is on the order of 0.1 cm 1 and is on the order of 0.8 eV, rates will be damped by relaxation times in the 100-ns range (42); however, if HAB 0.01 cm 1, a number more appropriate for coupling beyond the Cc surface (51), damping motions by this mechanism must have effective relaxation times of 10 s or longer.

Additionally, differential coupling of the extended Fe(II) heme donor orbital to the acceptor site on CcP also may mitigate structural effects. Molecular orbital calculations on hCc indicate that the heme iron-centered HOMO, which accepts and donates electrons, delocalizes over protein regions relatively distant to the cofactor (48). Thus, coupling of ZnCcP electronic states with this HOMO may compensate changes in the orientation and separation of Cc. However, studies by Gray and colleagues (3, 14) on Ru-modified Cc (3) and Cc coupled to electrodes via self-assembled monolayers (14) indicate that ET from the heme to the Cc surface reflects the detailed structure of bonding pathways and interfacial contacts (3). Conclusions These studies demonstrate that transient protein-protein interactions have high sensitivity to small structural changes at interfaces. Remarkably, addition of a hydroxyl group to Phe-82, a residue on the periphery of the WT CcP contact region, completely disrupts the favored association mode. These results give caution to interpreting reactivity data of protein variants with even subtly altered

surface properties. The insensitivity of keb to distance and cofactor orientation in some variants likely reflects limiting dynamic processes, although changes in electronic coupling due to different cofactor orientations cannot as yet be ruled out. The slower forward rates, which give monoexponential kinetics through the transition temperature range, are gated by dynamic processes that allows rapid sampling but rare conversion to active states. As the crystal fixes the general association mode (but allows some structural variability), it follows that the active states do not structurally differ substantially from the inactive states. This hypothesis could explain why the variants that maintain the WT yCc:CcP association mode have significantly slower back ET rates than the WT complex. The alternate association modes observed for the CcS complex may represent the extent of such conformational motion. Presumably, the WT complex limits conversion to unreactive structures, because its charge recombination rate exceeds that of all other variants.
