Abstract The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme diaminopimelate decarboxylase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been determined in a new crystal form and ° refined to a resolution of 2.33 A. The monoclinic crystals contain one tetramer exhibiting D2-symmetry in the asymmetric unit. The tetramer exhibits a donut-like structure with a hollow interior. All four active sites are accessible only from the interior of the tetrameric assembly. Small-angle X-ray scattering indicates that in solution the predominant oligomeric species of the protein is a dimer, but also that higher oligomers exist at higher protein concentrations. The observed scattering data are best explained by assuming a dimer­tetramer equilibrium with about 7% tetramers present in solution. Consequently, at the elevated protein concentrations in the crowded environment inside the cell the observed tetramer may constitute the biologically relevant functional unit of the enzyme.

Introduction Tuberculosis (TB), which is typically caused by the Grampositive bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is still one of the major infectious diseases globally. A recent WHO report estimates that about one-third of the world's population is latently infected with Mtb [1] and that about 10% of those will at some time during their lives develop active TB. The current worldwide incidence of new TB cases per year is approximately nine million and the number of fatalities is expected to lie anywhere between two and three million. The limited efficacy of the only known vaccine against TB, the BCG strain [2], which is an attenuated strain of the related bacterium Mycobacterium bovis as well as the emergence of more and more drugresistant Mtb strains, call for concerted efforts of the academic sector and the pharmaceutical industry to identify new lead compounds that may be developed into new antimycobacterial drugs. The sequencing of the complete genome of the best-characterized virulent Mtb-strain H37Rv in 1998 [3, 4] and of the highly virulent strain

CDC1551 4 years later [5] has provided unprecedented opportunities to identify gene products unique to Mtb, which may be considered new drug targets. The amino acid L-lysine is produced from its precursor L-aspartate in nine enzymatically catalysed steps within the lysine biosynthetic pathway. Since the pathway also yields compounds that are absolutely vital for both cell wall biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism, and since the pathway occurs only in bacteria, fungi and plants and is absent in humans, its enzymes may be considered promising potential target candidates for the development of new herbicides and new antibacterial drugs [6]. The last step in this pathway, the conversion of meso-diaminopimelate to L-lysine (see also Scheme 1) is catalysed by the enzyme diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC, LysA, EC 4.1.1.20). In Mtb, DAPDC is deemed to be of particular importance since immuno-compromised mice, which were infected with a lysine auxotroph Mtb-strain generated by disrupting the Mtb lysA-gene, were able to eradicate the bacteria from their system. In contrast, if those mice were infected with a complemented Mtb mutant, they died within 3 weeks [7]. The crystal structures of DAPDC from Escherichia coli both in complex with PLP and with PLP and lysine have been determined ([8]; PDB entries 1KNW and 1KO0, [9]) as have the crystal structures of the enzyme from Methanococcus jannaschii in complex with a substrate analogue as well as in complex with PLP and lysine (PDB entries 1TUF and 1TWI, [10]). More recently, the crystal structure of the enzyme from M. tuberculosis (Mtb-DAPDC, Rv1293) has been described in complex with lysine as well as in complex with both PLP and lysine (PDB entries 1HKV and 1HKW, [7]) as well as the structure of DAPDC from Helicobacter pylori in complex with L-lysine (PDB entry 2QGH, [11]). Furthermore, the coordinates of two unpublished DAPDC-structures are available in the PDB: the structure of a presumed DAPDC (protein AQ1208) from Aquifex aeolicus (PDB entry 2P3E, [12]) and of DAPDC from Thermotoga maritima in complex with PLP (PDB entry 2YXX, [13]). Although early ultracentrifugation studies on DAPDC from E. coli suggest the presence of DAPDC tetramers in solution [14], all published articles on three-dimensional structures of DAPDCs refer to the canonical DAPDC-dimer as the functional unit.

As part of our attempts to structurally characterize all enzymes of the lysine biosynthetic pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mtb-DAPDC has recently been cloned, over-expressed, purified and crystallized in a new crystal form [15]. Here, we report the three-dimensional ° structure of Mtb-DAPDC refined to a resolution of 2.33 A, and describe some surprising new features of this structure, which may provide some clues about the function of the enzyme and the regulation of its activity.

Materials and methods Cloning, expression, purification and crystallization The cloning, expression and purification of Mtb-DAPDC has been described previously [15]. In brief, Mtb-DAPDC was cloned, heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by affinity and size exclusion chromatography. The yellow protein solution in 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 5 mM DTT was then used for crystallization experiments. Crystals could be grown in the presence of 20­23% (w/v) PEG-MME 5000, 0.1 M MES pH 6.1­6.6, and 60 mM (NH4)2SO4 using the hanging-drop vapour diffusion technique at room temperature. Crystals appeared within about 7 days and grew to a maximum size of about 300 9 300 9 300 lm3. They dif° fract X-rays to about 2.2 A resolution. Diffraction data collection and processing As reported previously, a complete diffraction data set was ° collected on the EMBL Hamburg beamline X11 to 2.33 A resolution [15]. The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains four molecules and the inspection of the self-rotation function revealed the presence of three orthogonal noncrystallographic twofold axes, thus indicating that the quaternary structure of the protein molecules in the asymmetric unit is that of a homotetramer exhibiting D2symmetry, despite the fact that in solution the protein appears to be dimeric [15]. Structure determination and refinement The structure was solved using molecular replacement. As a search model, the structure of Mtb-DAPDC, which had previously been determined at lower resolution and in a different crystal form, was chosen (PDB entry 1HKV, [7]). The dimeric model was prepared by stripping off all solvent and co-factor atoms and subjected to the molecular replacement procedure implemented in the program MOLREP [16, 17]. All calculations were carried out to a ° maximum resolution of 3.0 A. After orienting and placing

the first dimer, the R-factor was 49.4% and the correlation coefficient 0.41. The introduction of the second dimer into the model improved the R-factor to 34.4% and the correlation coefficient to 0.72 indicating the correctness of the solution. Subsequently, the model was refined using the rigid-body refinement procedure implemented in REFMAC5 [16, 18]. For refinement, 2% of all reflections ° (about 1,600 to the maximum resolution limit of 2.33 A) were set aside for free R-factor calculations. Twenty cycles ° of rigid-body refinement at 3.0 A resolution reduced the Rfactor to 32.2% and the free R-factor to 32.0%, thus confirming that the solution obtained by molecular replacement was essentially correct. For further refinement, the resolution was increased to the maximum resolution of the ° collected data, 2.33 A. Twenty cycles of conjugate gradient refinement in REFMAC5 resulted in an R-factor of 27.1% and a free R-factor of 32.7%. Subsequently, the model was inspected in the molecular graphics program COOT [19] using SigmaA-weighted (2Fobs - Fcalc, acalc)- and (Fobs Fcalc, acalc)-electron density maps [20], rebuilt and further refined. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used in all rounds of the refinement. A total of nine rounds of manual inspection, rebuilding, adding of water molecules and further refinement reduced the R-factor to 19.3% and the free R-factor to 24.4%. The relevant refinement parameters are listed in Table 1. The refined atomic coordinates as well as the corresponding structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the PDB under the accession number 2O0T. Structure validation and search for homologous structures The validation of the final model was carried out using the programs PROCHECK [21]. Structure comparisons and three-dimensional alignments values were carried out using the program LSQKAB [16, 22] as well as the Protein Structure Comparison Service SSM [23] at the European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm). The analysis of the SSM search was limited to protein chains exhibiting a Q-score of greater than 0.35. The Q-score is a combined score taking into account the total number of amino acids in the chains to be aligned, the number of aligned amino acids and the r.m.s.d. value between the aligned stretches. Buried surface areas were calculated using the program DSSP [24] and interfaces and assemblies were examined using the PISA server [25]. Small angle X-ray scattering Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data were collected on beamline X33 of the EMBL Hamburg Outstation [26]. Mtb-DAPDC samples in crystallization buffer [15] were

measured at protein concentrations of 9 and 18 mg/ml, which correspond to DAPDC monomer concentrations of 0.19 and 0.38 mM, respectively. The samples were checked for the absence of radiation damage, and the scattering curves were processed and extrapolated to infinite dilution following standard procedures [27]. The relative molecular mass of the solute was estimated by calibration against a reference solution of bovine serum albumin. The expected scattering curves from the dimeric and tetrameric atomic models were calculated using the program CRYSOL [28]. The volume fractions of dimers and tetramers in a mixture, which yield the best fit to the experimental SAXS data, were computed using the program OLIGOMER [27].

Results and discussion The final structural model of Mtb-DAPDC The refined model of Mtb-DAPDC consists of residues 2­ 447 (the residue numbering is according to the amino acid sequence derived from the Mtb genome) in all four

subunits A­D, two PLP moieties covalently bound to Lys72 in subunits C and D, two sulfate ions bound in the active sites of subunits A and B, and 393 water molecules. Only the three N-terminal amino acids Met-Ala-Val (the two extra amino acids Met and Ala are the result of the cloning procedure) as well as the 18-residue C-terminal extension Gly-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ala-Ala-Ala-LeuGlu-(His)6 harboring the thrombin cleavage site were not visible in the electron density map. With R and Rfree-values ° of 19.3% and 24.4% (Table 1) to 2.33 A resolution, the model can be considered well refined. Also, the geometrical parameters of the model (Table 1) are in the range of what can be expected for a structure refined to that resolution. Owing to the fact that non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used throughout the refinement, the four protein subunits in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical. They can be superimposed with r.m.s.d. values of ° 0.12­0.16 A based on 446 matched Ca-pairs. A comparison with the previously determined structure of Mtb-DAPDC at somewhat lower resolution and in a different crystal form ° [7] yields r.m.s.d. values of 0.32­0.36 A, also based on 446 matched Ca-pairs. This is still about the same as the expected coordinate error based on the refinement R-factor, ° which is 0.35 A. The tertiary structure of Mtb-DAPDC The overall structure of the Mtb-DAPDC homodimer is shown in Fig. 1, and the structure of the Mtb-DAPDC monomer in Fig. 2. Each subunit of the dimer consists of 23 b-strands and 10 a-helices and can be subdivided into

two structural domains delineated in red and blue in Fig. 2. Domain 1 is composed of residues 2­47 and 303­447 and consists of predominantly b-sheet structure. The N-terminal segment of the chain is arranged in a small threestranded mixed b-sheet (b1­3). After an a-helix (a1) and a b-strand (b4), the polypeptide chain leaves the first domain and enters the second domain, which consists of residues 48­303 and which is described in detail below. The Cterminal segment of domain 1 forms an almost closed bbarrel consisting of six b-strands (b13­18). The b-strands, at which the barrel is left unclosed, b15 and b17, are ° approximately 7.5 A apart from each other, thus making direct hydrogen bonding impossible. In some instances, weak difference electron density in between the two bstrands indicates the presence of water molecules, which may saturate the hydrogen bonding potential of the two open end strands of the barrel. One strand of the b6-barrel (b13) is much longer than the other barrel-strands and participates in addition in a four-stranded mixed b-sheet involving the strands from the N-terminal (b4) and the Cterminal segment (b19 and b20) of the polypeptide chain. As mentioned above, domain two constitutes an insertion into domain 1. It forms a a/b-barrel consisting of eight parallel b-strands in the barrel (b5­12) and eight a-helices surrounding the barrel (a2­9). In contrast to the typically observed (b/a)8-barrels, the barrel observed here starts with an a-helix and thus should be named (a/b)8-barrel accordingly. After the fifth strand of the barrel (b9), two extra b-strands denoted b9a and b9b are present, where strand b9a can be considered an extension of strand b9. Strands b9a and b9b associate and form an antiparallel bhairpin. Similarly, strand b10 continues into another strand denoted b10a, which associates with the b9a/b9b-hairpin to form a mixed three-stranded b-sheet. This sheet constitutes an extra feature of the barrel, and it is of particularly interest, because it is the structural feature that is intimately involved in the formation of the tetramer as discussed below. The structure description presented here is more detailed than and differs in some aspects from the one

previously published [7]. The reason for this may be that the some of the secondary structure assignment may have been ambiguous, owing to the lower resolution of the structure. The quaternary structure of Mtb-DAPDC in the crystal Two subunits of Mtb-DAPDC associate tightly to form a homodimer. Upon association a large surface area of ° approximately 3,600 A2 per subunit is buried. This constitutes about 20% of the total surface area of one monomer. In addition, a covalent linkage between the subunits is formed by an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys93 and Cys375. Accordingly, it appears as if this dimer is also the physiological oligomer. This is corroborated by the fact that Mtb-DAPDC in dilute solution occurs also as a dimer [15]. However, as had already been suggested earlier based on the inspection of the self rotation function, two homodimers of Mtb-DAPDC associate in the crystal and form a homotetramer exhibiting D2-symmetry. This association happens through the pairing of the strands b9b of two adjacent subunits. This strand is part of the mixed threestranded b-sheet consisting of the strands b9a, b9b and b10a, the extra structural feature of the (a/b)8-barrel discussed above. Upon pairing the strands, six new hydrogen bonds form (Table 2) and a six-stranded b-sheet is created across the new twofold axis. In addition to the main chain hydrogen bonds the side chain of Ile174 is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with its symmetry mate and the side chains of Ser175 and Phe173 interact via a C­HÁÁÁp hydrogen bond [29, 30]. Three views of the resulting tetramer are shown in Fig. 3, each view along one of the three perpendicular twofold axes. The buried surface area of this

new dimer/dimer-interface is only slightly larger than ° about 900 A2 per dimer, to which mainly the interfaces A/C and B/D contribute. However, because of its peculiar structure, it seems unlikely that this interface is merely a crystallization artifact, despite its small size. Support for this hypothesis comes from the inspection of the previously determined Mtb-DAPDC structure [7]. Even though a different construct was used and the protein was crystallized in a different crystal packing, the very same tetramers exist in the crystal. In this case, the association of the two dimers occurs across a crystallographic twofold axis. The quaternary structure of Mtb-DAPDC in solution As mentioned above, the protein appears to be dimeric in dilute solutions [15], but an equilibrium may exist between the dimeric and the tetrameric form. At higher protein concentrations this equilibrium will be shifted more towards the tetramer. In order to verify the oligomeric

On the left panel, the view along the same dyad as in Fig. 1 is shown. The tight association between subunits A and B as well as between C and D is apparent. A rotation about the horizontal dyad by 908 relates the left panel to the central

composition of Mtb-DAPDC in solution at higher protein concentrations, a SAXS experiment (Fig. 4) was conducted. The resulting numbers for the molecular mass of the solute and the radius of gyration Rg were ° 120 ± 10 kDa and 30.5 ± 0.4 A, respectively. These values are both somewhat larger than the ones expected for those of the crystallographic homodimer (94.5 kDa and ° 29.7 A) but are significantly smaller than those of the tet° ramer (189 kDa and 36.0 A). The scattering pattern computed from the crystallographic dimer yields a reasonable fit to the experimental data with discrepancy v = 1.9 although the fit also exhibits some systematic deviations (see curve 2 in Fig. 4). The computed scattering from the tetramer fails to fit the experimental data at all (curve 3 in Fig. 4; v = 18.7). These results suggest that Mtb-DAPDC

is predominantly dimeric in solution but also that higher oligomeric species are likely to be present. As a matter of fact, the scattering data can be more adequately described by a linear combination of the scattering from dimers and tetramers. The experimental scattering pattern is best reproduced by assuming a mixture of 93 ± 2% dimers and 7 ± 2% tetramers (curve 4 in Fig. 4, v = 1.4). The ° apparent Rg of this mixture (30.4 A) fits the experimental value very well and the fit becomes visibly better especially in the range of the scattering vectors up to the resolution of ° about 30 A which is the range dominated by the quaternary structure. The significance of the observed improvement of the fit can be assessed by the fact that the squared ratio of v obeys an F-distribution [31]. The probability that the discrepancy decreases from v1 to v2 by chance is given by the cumulative distribution F[(v2/v1), m1, m2], where the numbers of degrees of freedom m1, m2 are both of the order of the number of experimental points (about 1,500). This probability is vanishingly small (less than 10-30) indicating that the tetramers, although present in small quantities in solution, yield a statistically significant fit improvement to the experimental data. Summarizing, our results point to the presence of a higher oligomeric species in concentrated solutions of largely dimeric Mtb-DAPDC. Assuming the most plausible scenario, an equilibrium between dimers and tetramers, the agreement to the experimental data can be significantly improved compared to the assumption of a purely dimeric solution. These data thus lend support to the tetramerization hypothesis discussed above. Further support for the tetramerization hypothesis comes from early ultracentrifugation studies on DAPDC from E. coli, which suggested that in solution the E. coli enzyme is a tetramer as well [14]. Comparison with other DAPDCs and aminotransferases The topology of Mtb-DAPDC (Fig. 2) clearly identifies the enzyme as belonging to the class III of PLP-binding proteins together with alanine racemase and ornithine decarboxylase [32]. A secondary structure matching (SSM) search against all structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank using only one subunit of the Mtb-DAPDC yielded a total of 69 hits above a Q-score threshold of 0.40. After removing redundancies, 12 entries from the PDB were left with Q-scores ranging from 0.44 to 0.99 (Table 3). The closest match, excluding the previously determined structure of Mtb-DAPDC [7], was to the presumed DAPDC from A. aeolicus [12] and to the DAPDCs from M. jannaschii [10], and H. pylori [11]. It is to some extent surprising that the structure of Mtb-DAPDC is significantly more different to DAPDC from E. coli [9] than to the other DAPDC enzymes, even though the sequence identity values all range between 28% and 33%. With such rather low

The plot displays the logarithm of the scattering intensity I versus the momentum transfer s = 4psinh/k, where 2h is the ° scattering angle and k = 1.5 A is the X-ray wavelength used for the experiment. The main plot shows the four curves for scattering ° vectors up to s = 0.2 A-1 which is the range dominated by the quaternary structure of the molecules in solution in order to better visualize the improvement of the fit when 7% tetramers are assumed in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium. The four curves for the full range are displayed in the insert

amino acid sequence identity values it seems that the various bacterial DAPDCs are a bit more heterogeneous in terms of amino acid sequence and structure as other enzymes of the lysine biosynthetic pathway, such as for instance dihydrodipicolinate synthase (Rv2753c). Further structural matches comprise Lys/ornithine decarboxylase, Arg decarboxylase, Btrk decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase. Alanine racemase, which also belongs to the class III of PLP-binding proteins, can also be found in the SSM search, although below the set Q-score threshold. A structure-based sequence alignment of the DAPDC entries of Table 3 revealed that the sequences stretches harboring the residues forming three-stranded b-sheet responsible for the formation of the tetramer in particular strand b9b in Mtb-DAPDC (residues 171­177) belong to variable regions in the sequences (Table 4). In the presumed DAPDC from A. aeolicus [12], the region was found to be disordered and was not built in the electron

density. In the DAPDCs from M. jannaschii [10] and T. maritima [13], the b-sheet is not present and the region folds into a loop and a short a-helix. In the DAPDCs from H. pylori [11] and E. coli [9], a b-hairpin consisting of strands b9a and b10a is present, but the third strand, b9b is absent. This suggests that the extra b-sheet, which forms the tetramerisation interface, is a special feature of MtbDAPDC. However, an interfaces and assemblies analysis using the PISA server [25] revealed that the DAPDCs from M. jannaschii [10] and from T. maritima [13] may also form tetramers, which are stable in solution. In these two cases, the C-terminal a-helices of all four subunits are intimately involved in the formation of the tetramer. Implications for the reaction mechanism The Mtb-DAPDC tetramer forms a donut-like structure. Access to its inside is only possible along one of the three­

Fig. 5 Surface representation of Mtb-DAPDC in the same orientation as the central panel of Fig. 3. The access channel to the interior of the tetramer is clearly discernible. The approximate dimensions in the ° channel opening is about 12 9 24 A taking van der Waals radii of the channel delineating atoms into account. The figure was prepared using Pymol [45]

two-fold tetramer axes (Fig. 5). The opening of the channel ° is approximately 12 by 24 A if the van der Waals radii of the atoms lining the channel opening are taken into account. In this structure, all of the four active sites of the tetramer face the interior of the donut, which means that the substrate must diffuse through the channel to access the active sites and the product has to diffuse out again. Such a mechanism bears the inherent possibility of regulating enzyme activity by either regulating oligomerization or by regulating the access to the active site. In the least, the tetramer model fits well with the other oligomeric states of the structures of other enzymes from the M. tuberculosis lysine biosynthetic pathway, which have been determined by us or by others. Dihydrodipicolinate synthase is a tetramer [33, 34], dihydrodipicolinate reductase is also a tetramer [15, 35, 36, 37] and succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase [38, 39] as well as aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase [40] are dimers. The only known exception to this appears to be tetrahydrodipicolinate Nsuccinyltransferase [41, 42], which exists as a trimer in solution. However, whether this model is indeed physiologically relevant has to await further investigations.
