Determination of the structure of seleno-methionine-labelled hydroxymethylbilane synthase in its active form by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion
The enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS, E.C. 4.3.1.8) catalyzes the conversion of porphobilinogen into hydroxymethylbilane, a key intermediate for the biosynthesis of heme, chlorophylls, vitamin B12 and related macrocycles. The enzyme is found in all organisms, except viruses. The crystal structure of the selenomethionine-labelled enzyme ([SeMet]HMBS) from Escherichia coli has been solved by the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) experimental method using the Daresbury SRS station 9.5. In addition, [SeMet]HMBS has been studied by MAD at the Grenoble ESRF MAD beamline BM14 (BL19) and this work is described especially with respect to the use of the ESRF CCD detector. The structure at ambient temperature has been Ê re®ned, the R factor being 16.8% at 2.4 A resolution. The dipyrromethane cofactor of the enzyme is preserved in its reduced form in the crystal and its geometrical shape is in full agreement with the crystal structures of authentic dipyrromethanes. Proximal to the reactive C atom of the reduced cofactor, spherical density is seen consistent with there being a water molecule ideally placed to take part in the ®nal step of the enzyme reaction cycle. Intriguingly, the loop with residues 47±58 is not ordered in the structure of this form of the enzyme, which carries no substrate. Direct experimental study of the active enzyme is now feasible using time-resolved Laue diffraction and freeze-trapping, building on the structural work described here as the foundation.

1. Introduction
The biosyntheses of the tetrapyrrolic ring systems of heme, chlorophylls, vitamin B12 and related pigments proceed via a common tetrapyrrolic intermediate, uroporphyrinogen III (Battersby et al., 1980; Eschenmoser, 1988; Battersby & Leeper, 1990). The latter compound is built from eight molecules of 5-aminolevulinic acid in a convergent manner in which three enzymes are involved (Fig. 1). In a reaction catalyzed by porphobilinogen synthase, pairs of 5-aminolevulinic acid molecules are ®rst combined to form porphobilinogen (PBG) with release of two equivalents of water (Mitchell & Jaffe, 1993). Then, an unstable oligomeric compound, hydroxymethylbilane (HMB), is built from four molecules of PBG with release of four equivalents of ammonia and the consumption of one water molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS; E.C. 4.3.1.8; also known as porphobilinogen deaminase). A remarkable cyclization involving a rearrangement with loss of water, catalyzed by uroporphyrinogen III synthase, then leads to uroporphyrinogen III (Fig. 1). Considerable worldwide effort is put into the investigation of these enzymes (Chadwick

& Ackrill, 1994) not only because they are of vital importance for all organisms, except viruses, but also because defects in the biosynthesis of uroporphyrinogen III are associated with speci®c manifestations of the inherited disease porphyria in humans (Kappas et al., 1995). HMBS has been puri®ed from many sources, including human erythrocytes, rat liver, spinach, Euglena gracilis and E. coli (Jordan, 1994). Both chemical and biochemical experimental evidence shows that, in order to construct HMB from PBG, the HMBS holoenzyme uses an unusual dipyrromethane cofactor (Hart et al., 1987; Jordan & Warren, 1987) which is itself derived from two PBG building blocks and is covalently attached to the apoprotein via the S atom of a cysteine residue (Fig. 2a) (Jordan et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1988; Scott et al., 1988; Hart et al., 1990). The cofactor serves as an anchor to which the growing oligopeptide attached until a hexapyrrol chain has been built. It was established by 13C labelling that the free -position of the cofactor's PBG unit C2 (Fig. 2a) is the site to which the ®rst incoming PBG unit is covalently bound. Cleavage of the hexapyrrolic chain at that position releases the product and leaves the cofactor in place, ready for another reaction cycle (Hart et al., 1990). Hence, the enzyme is a polymerase with an inbuilt mechanism that somehow restricts the number of polymerization steps to four. The enzyme from E. coli (Hart et al., 1986; Jordan et al., È 1988; Hadener et al., 1990) is a 34 268 Da monomer of 313 amino-acid residues, six of which are methionines. The dipyrromethane cofactor is attached to Cys242. There are three further cysteine residues but none of them is involved with disul®de bridges. The pH optimum for HMBS from E. coli is between 7.4 and 8.0, and the isoelectric point is 4.5. Within the optimal pH interval and for the overall reaction, the Michaelis constant is between 5 and 20 mM, and the turnover constant is of the order of 0.1 sÀ1 with respect to the formation of HMB. With the aim of determining the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, crystals of a variant of HMBS having seleno-l-methionine (SeMet) in place of methionine ([SeMet]HMBS) were produced for multi-wavelength anomÈ alous dispersion (MAD) (Hadener et al., 1993). Another effort was directed towards the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of HMBS by crystallography and used multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) (Louie et al., 1992). È For the MAD approach, Hadener et al. (1993) optimized protocols for the expression, puri®cation and crystallization of catalytically active [SeMet]HMBS. High levels of selenium occupancies were obtained. Strongly reducing conditions were used to prevent both the cofactor and the side chains of the SeMet residues from being oxidized. Freshly grown crystals obtained in this way are colourless. The MIR structure determination (Jordan et al., 1992) used data collected from yellow crystals that had been grown at pH 5.0±5.5 in the presence of polyethylene glycol 6000. Louie et al. (1992) found that the polypeptide chain of the enzyme is folded into three a domains of roughly equal size (Protein Data Bank entry 1PDA). Two of the domains were found to have an overall topology similar to that of the group-II periplasmic binding proteins (Spurlino et al., 1991) and of a duplicated lobe of the bilobal transferrins (Baker et al., 1987; Sarra et al., 1990). Electron density for the cofactor is located in a cleft at the interface between these domains. It is connected to the S atom of the side chain of Cys242 in agreement with the earlier biochemical evidence mentioned above. Both the shape of the electron density for the cofactor and the yellow colour of the crystals indicated that the cofactor was present in an oxidized, inactive state. The oxidized state can most probably be interpreted by dipyrromethene or dipyrromethenone structures or mixtures thereof (Figs. 2b and 2c). Proximal to the activesite region, electron density for a stretch of polypeptide (residues 49± 57) was found to be missing. Louie et al. (1992) proposed that this loop may constitute a ¯exible `lid' with a role in transiently blocking the access of solvent to the active site during catalysis. Short stretches of polypeptide have also been found to be mobile at both the N- and the Cterminus (missing residues 1±2 and 308±313, respectively). È For [SeMet]HMBS Hadener et al. (1993), in a preliminary X-ray analysis with a Cu K source in Basle, located the selenium sites in a Fourier difference map that was Figure 1 calculated using the difference The biosynthesis of uroporphyrinogen III from 5-aminolevulinic acid. The enzymes involved are (a) 5FSeMet (colourless crystal, reduced aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase; (b) hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS); and (c) uroporphyr[SeMet]HMBS) minus Fwild-type inogen III synthase.

(yellow crystal, oxidized HMBS) and where phases were calculated from the crystal structure model of oxidized HMBS, determined by MIR (Louie et al., 1992). One of the six Se sites was found to be of low peak height indicating increased mobility at that position. Five of the six sites were, however, well ordered and well suited therefore for subsequent MAD data collection. In addition to difference peaks at the selenium sites, the difference map revealed signi®cant difference density near the active site, where there are no Se atoms present, indicating that the colourless crystals of [SeMet]HMBS may indeed represent the catalytically active form of the enzyme carrying the cofactor in its original, reduced state and thus be structurally distinct from the È oxidized, yellow, crystals (Hadener et al., 1993). Subsequently the reduced, active, form of HMBS was re®ned using the model of the oxidized form of HMBS as the starting point (Louie et al., 1996). This revealed in particular that the position of the C2 pyrrole unit of the cofactor (Fig. 2a) is distinct for the two oxidation states of the cofactor. The position of the C2 pyrrole unit of the oxidized cofactor has been proposed then to represent a binding pocket for substrate [termed the S site (Louie et al., 1996)] in each of the chain elongation steps involved in the catalytic cycle (Louie et al., 1992). A MAD structure elucidation of the active, reduced, form of the enzyme was nevertheless feasible, and would be independent of the oxidized structure (Louie et al., 1992, 1996). Moreover, the lack of visibility of the 49±57 loop in the two earlier structures, most likely due to its being associated with the catalytic mechanism in some currently unknown way, certainly was worthy of further investigation with reduced enzyme and freshly prepared crystals. The possible movement of this loop, very close to which is a conserved Asp residue (Asp46), may have a critical bearing on the `proton shuttle' mechanism proposed by Louie et al. (1992, 1996) involving solely Asp84. Two sets of MAD data have been collected, one at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) in Daresbury, the other at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble. The purpose of the SRS experiment was to solve the structure of the active crystal form de novo. At SRS, [SeMet]HMBS was the ®rst SeMet-labelled protein that was subjected to a MAD experiment in the course of the commissioning of station 9.5 (Brammer et al., 1988). At ESRF this was the ®rst project to test the ERSF image-intensi®er detector during a commissioning run (Biou et al., 1997; Helliwell et al., 1996). Each of these MAD technical studies, as well as the SRS HMBS MAD structure, are reported in this paper.

2. Data collection and processing
2.1. Expression, puri®cation and crystallization of [SeMet]HMBS

[SeMet]HMBS was expressed by growing the methioninerequiring mutant E. coli PO1562, carrying the plasmid pPA410, in a medium containing 50 mg lÀ1 SeMet as the sole source of methionine, and puri®ed as previously described È (Hadener et al., 1993). Dithiothreitol was included with the buffers at up to 10 mM during puri®cation and at 30 mM for storage so as to obstruct the oxidation of the cofactor. The enzyme was crystallized at pH 5.3 by equilibrating sitting drops of 50 ml with 6±7 mg mlÀ1 of protein, 0.3 mM EDTA, 15 mM dithiothreitol, 10%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.01% NaN3 in 0.1 M sodium acetate against a reservoir of 10± 20 mg solid dithiothreitol. For the SRS experiments the crystals were used within 2 weeks, and at ESRF within 8 weeks, of setting up the crystallizations with the enzyme in its reduced state. In both cases the crystallization experiments were set up near the beamline to avoid the need for excessive transportation.

This was accomplished by switching the wavelength after wedges of 6 (i.e. two images were recorded per wavelength). A set of six 3 images, two for each wavelength, was thus collected in sequence in an iterative manner. The time taken to change the wavelength was ca 8 s. The time taken to read out each diffraction image was ca 90 s (i.e. the Figure 3 data acquisition ef®ciency was ~50%).

ESRF (see below). Subsequently use of averaged anomalous differences over the three wavelengths measured at SRS (which are each of equivalent quality, see Table 1) yielded a high-quality Patterson map (Fig. 4). In any case, the selenium positions could be derived from calculated phases based on the oxidized HMBS structure (Louie et al., 1992), i.e. as had È been reported by Hadener et al. (1993); such anomalous difference Fourier maps using the ÁANOM data sets for each of the three SRS wavelengths were indeed calculated. These various Fourier maps were all in agreement with each other, and also are in agreement with the anomalous difference Patterson map shown in Fig. 4.

These DMimproved three-wavelength phases were used to calculate an electrondensity map (Fig. 5), using the f H -dip data as native (!2), from which a model was constructed using the BONES option of O (Jones et al., 1991). A two-wavelength calculation in MLPHARE was also performed using the f H dip (!2) as native and the f HH reference data set as the second wavelength (!4). This was also subjected to phase improvement with DM. Table 5 shows the comparison of these two-wavelength experimental phases and after DM phase improvement (a comparison of a slab of the electron-density maps for the 2-! after DM phases versus the 3-! MAD experimental phases was made by Chayen et al., 1996).

improved Patterson map (for !3) was achieved (Helliwell et al., 1996). Both the better completeness and the fact that the data were recorded at low temperature may have signi®cantly contributed to this result. This work showed that the CCD detector developed at ESRF, with its rapid readout and accurate data, is useful for protein crystallography, including MAD. Subsequent use of the detector for solving new protein structures by MAD has indeed con®rmed the high quality of the data obtainable and its utility for MAD experiments (Biou et al., 1997). Fig. 4 (at bottom right) shows, for comparison with the SRS IP Patterson calculation, one of the Harker sections (u = 1/2); this is also calculated from the averaged anomalous differences across !2b, !3, and !4 as was carried out for the SRS Harker sections shown in Fig. 4.

3.1. Molecular geometry parameters for the re®nement of the reduced dipyrromethane cofactor

To obtain a valid geometry for the reduced dipyrromethane cofactor, the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) (Allen et al., 1979) was searched for matches containing either an unsubstituted dipyrromethane moiety or an appropriately
Acta Cryst. (1999). D55, 631±643

furnished thioether substructure (Fig. 6a). Seven of the matches, i.e. BILRUB10 (Bonnett et al., 1978), DAPPIT (Stark et al., 1985), ECTEPM (Bonnett et al., 1972), EXBILE (Sheldrick & Becker, 1979), JOSMUZ (Sessler et al., 1992), LAZMOO (Engel et al., 1993), MESBIL (Becker & Sheldrick, 1978), as well as JAMRUK (Reagen & Radonovich, 1989), containing an unsubstituted pyrrole molecule, were found useful to de®ne the dipyrromethane geometry. Of the large number of matches for the thioether moiety, 14 were used to de®ne the geometry of the thioether linkage. A dictionary of bond distances and bond angles for the reduced cofactor and its attachment to the Cys side chain was constructed from these entries (Fig. 6b, Table 6). Corresponding topology and parameter ®les for use within È X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) were then generated from the dictionary and the self consistency of the parameter ®le was con®rmed by X-PLOR energy minimization. Appropriate improper constraints were included to restrain the carboxylate groups of the acetate and propionate side chains of the cofactor as well as the atoms of each of the pyrrole rings, including the atoms directly attached to the rings, to planarity. Appropriate dihedral constants were included in analogy to those found in the topology and parameter ®les for the parameterization of protein residues (Engh & Huber, 1991), in particular of Phe, Asp, Glu, and Met. Nonbonded constants were de®ned in analogy to those of the pre-de®ned atoms CH2E, C, OC, NH1, and some of the atoms of the indole moiety of Trp. The O atoms of the carboxylate groups were speci®ed as hydrogen-bond acceptors and the pyrrole HÐN groups were de®ned as hydrogen-bond donors. The PATCH statement of X-PLOR was used to attach the CHA atom of the cofactor (residue DPM) to the SG atom of the Cys side chain.

3.2. Molecular geometry parameters for the re®nement of the SeMet residue

The topology and parameter ®les for the SeMet residue for use within X-PLOR were constructed in analogy to those for the Met residue. Appropriate bond distances and bond angles were adapted from a crystal structure of seleno-d,l-methionine (Rajeswaran & Parthasarathy, 1984). In particular, the selenoether substructure was de®ned by specifying 1.91 and Ê 1.94 A for the SeÐCH3 and SeÐ CH2 bond distances, and by setting the angles CH3ÐSeÐCH2 and SeÐ CH2ÐCH2 to 98.91 and 114.16 , respectively.

The SRS 3-! MAD+DM phased electron-density map (Fig. 5b) was interpreted on both a Silicon Graphics and an Evans & Sutherland molecular graphics workstation using the automatic BONES option of O. This was readily performed as polyalanine in ®ve polypeptide segments corresponding to the following regions within the amino-acid sequence, namely, residues 6±41; 63±110; 113± 219; 221±236 and 244±302. Initially the loop carrying the cofactor was not visible and density for the cofactor was not clear. Alternating cycles of simulated annealing with X-PLOR and model building within O was then conducted. At each re®nement cycle both the R and the È Rfree (Brunger, 1993) factors (based on 10% of the data not included in the re®nement) were calculated. The data set used for the re®nement Ê was that collected at 0.9 A waveÊ resolution (Table 7). length to 2.4 A After the ®nal cycle, the r.m.s. deviations of geometry from ideal Ê values were 0.009 A (bonds), 1.751  (angles), 23.46 (dihedrals), and 1.428 (impropers). The outcome from this re®nement was the structure of [SeMet]HMBS in its active reduced

form illustrated in Fig. 7. The ®nal model comprises 2298 atoms, representing 299 residues, now including the C terminus up to residue 313 (i.e. beyond the 308 position of the MIR model), and the dipyrromethane cofactor of the [SeMet]HMBS holoenzyme, and 177 water molecules. The coordinates of the re®ned structure model have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977).
3.4. The structure of the active site

The dipyrromethane structure model of the reduced cofactor, as built according to mean values for bond lengths and angles taken from independent representative dipyrromethanes in the CSD, readily ®tted into the electron density that was available in the active site after re®nement cycle 5 of the ambient-temperature structure (Table 7). This is noteworthy because the cofactor is conformationally restricted due to the small number of bonds that allow rotation and due to

the restriction to planarity of the atoms of each of the pyrrole rings including the atoms directly attached to the rings. The most critical bond angle at the methylene bridge C4AÐ CHBÐC1B (Fig. 6) between the pyrrole rings is required to be 115.37 Æ 1.24 (n = 9) based on the collection of independent dipyrromethanes reported above. This bond angle in the re®ned ®nal model is 114.0 in agreement with this value. This evidence shows that this MAD-derived structure, which is independent, i.e. derived from a completely new set of phases, electron-density map and subsequent model re®nement, represents the enzyme in its catalytically active state with its cofactor in the reduced form. The MIR-derived model (Louie et al., 1992) however, shows the cofactor in an oxidized, catalytically inactive state, probably as a dipyrromethenone (Fig. 2c) possibly in admixture with the corresponding dipyrromethene (Fig. 2b). This view is supported by the ®ndings summarized below. (i) The two pyrrole rings in the MIR-derived model are almost coplanar in agreement with the %-conjugation being extended across both rings of a dipyrromethenone or dipyrromethene. (ii) The C4AÐCHBÐC1B bond angle of 124.9 in the MIR-derived model (PDB entry code 1PDA) agrees with CHB being in a planar sp2-hybridized state. (iii) Whereas the MIR-derived electron-density map shows a lobe of electron density emanating from C4B of the cofactor's second pyrrole ring (in keeping with a dipyrromethenone, Fig. 2c), the MAD-derived map does not show this feature, again supporting an active, dipyrromethane structure for the cofactor. (iv) Pyrromethanes are colourless and so active HMBS should also be colourless; this was true for the crystals used for the MAD studies. Those for the work based on MIR were yellow. Fig. 8 compares the two cofactor states and the reduced cofactor is highlighted by the (Fo À Fc ) difference electron density. It is interesting that adjacent to the atom C4B, which represents the catalytically important free -position of the cofactor's second pyrrole ring C2, electron density is present which is spherical in shape (at 3.5', see Fig. 8). Since this density is closer to C4B than to any other atom of the holoenzyme or ordered water molecule, its molecular origin deserves further comment. Among possible candidates are an ordered water molecule or an ion. Electrospray mass spectrometry of [SeMet]HMBS did not reveal the presence of any È strongly bound material (Hadener et al., 1993) and HMBS is known not to depend on any essential ions for catalysis. Furthermore, the only spherical ion in the mother liquor that was used to crystallize [SeMet]HMBS is Na+. The shape of the density and the fact that there is a hydrogen bond donor/ Ê acceptor in its vicinity (the OH group of Ser81 at 3.3 A) support the view that the density represents an ordered water molecule. A number of other groups are located within a Ê sphere of 4.0 A around the putative water molecule, i.e. the Ê Ê Ê water molecules 386 (3.5 A), 385 (3.6 A), 381 (4.0 A), the N Ê ), the O atom O2D of Asp84 atom NB of the cofactor (3.8 A Ê Ê (3.8 A), and the N atom NH1 of Arg11 (3.9 A).

Structural re®nement of the model of [SeMet]HMBS against the data collected at SRS station 9.5, ®tted into the 3-! MAD+DM phased electron-density map (Fig. 5b).
Ê Data were measured on station 9.5 at ! = 0.9 A from the third crystal (for details see text) and at ambient Ê temperature. The resolution range 8.0±2.4 A comprised 13 486 re¯ections (99.63% complete) with 13 285 re¯ections having jFo j b 2'jFo j. The model re®nement working set comprised 12 112 re¯ections (89% completeness) and the Rfree test set comprised 1374 re¯ections (10% completeness). Simulated-annealing re®nement (4000 K) was used in cycles 1±7. Positional re®nement was used in cycles 8±13. Of all 299 residues of the ®nal model, 254 are neither glycine, proline, nor end residues. Of these 254, 234 (92.1%), 17 (6.7%) and 3 (1.2%) are in the most favoured, the additional allowed, and the generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively, according to a PROCHECK analysis (Laskowski et al., 1993).

dinate displacement on C Ê atoms is 0.28 A and on all atoms Ê is 0.68 A. Since it is clear in this analysis that residues 40, 60±61, 149 and 241±243 show substantial differences due to the ¯exible loop and the alteration of the C2 ring position, these were then removed and the r.m.s. values recalculated. These were Ê Ê 0.22 A on C atoms and 0.53 A on all atoms.

4. Discussion and concluding remarks

The re®ned position of this putative water molecule, the B Ê Ê factor of which is 26.2 A2, at a distance of 3.2 A from the atom Ê C4B (coordinates x = 19.16, y = 7.03, z = 23.03 A) is very interesting in the context of the catalytic reaction cycle. The last step of the cycle was proposed to be initiated by protonation of the enzyme-bound hexapyrrole at C4B (Hart et al., 1990). An azafulvene can then be formed by elimination and this reactive intermediate ± still bound to the enzyme noncovalently ± can react with water to give the product HMB (Battersby et al., 1982). A water molecule at the position of the spherical density shown in Fig. 8 would be an ideal candidate for being involved in this catalytic mechanism. Since it is proximal to both the electron-rich C4B and the carboxylate group of Asp84, it could, being protonated, initiate the last step of the catalytic cycle by providing a proton to C4B. After elimination of the azafulvene, the now deprotonated water molecule would be ready to capture the reactive intermediate to produce HMB. Further corroboration of this `catalytic' water molecule can come from a higher resolution re®nement, which we are now Ê undertaking at 1.7 A. The fact that this is cryo data, in combination with theoretical modelling, may also assist the de®nition of the missing loop (residues 47±58). A least-squares superposition of the structures of the reduced, active form (1AH5, MAD-phased) and the oxidized form (1PDA, MIR-phased) of the enzyme was carried out. The different cofactors were obviously removed from the calculation, as were residues 308±313 of the MAD model which were not available in the MIR model. The r.m.s. coor-

This MAD study has yielded an independently derived structure 0.313 0.249 of the HMBS enzyme in its 0.305 0.237 active form at room temperature 0.299 0.226 (PDB deposited coordinate ®le Ê 1AH5), to 2.4 A resolution. The 0.283 0.215 reduced, active form of the 0.262 0.206 cofactor takes up a conforma0.255 0.189 tion consistent with known 0.245 0.177 0.235 0.168 dipyrromethane crystal structures. The loop of residues 47± 58, proximal to the active site, is still not visible. The positions of the C-terminal residues 308± 313 are now determined. The MAD structure determination, based on the SRS data, proceeded smoothly except for the fact that the anomalous Patterson map quality, based on the !3 (white-line f HH maximum) data set collected at ambient temperature (84% completeness), did not reveal all ®ve expected (ordered) seleno sites. Subsequently use of averaged anomalous differences, across all three wavelengths, for the SRS data showed that the calculated features of the selenium positions could be replicated. [SeMet]HMBS also served as a valuable test case to commission the ESRF BM14 CCD detector. Certainly the fact that the CCD detector could be used successfully here encouraged the subsequent wider use of the CCD for MAD projects at ESRF BM14. Indeed the data-collection ef®ciency of the CCD was ~100% versus that of the image-plate system of ~50%; obviously the values depend on the exposure times as well as detector readout times but the trend to quicker readout, whilst preserving accuracy, is clearly advantageous (Deacon et al., 1995; Thompson, 1996). The structure of HMBS in its active form, presented here, provides a platform for further studies of the enzyme binding with substrate and/or inhibitors. HMBS exhibits several features that make this enzyme an ideal candidate for timeresolved Laue crystallography. First of all, it is a rather slow enzyme [overall kcat = 0.1 sÀ1 at 310 K and pH 7.5 for the È saturated enzyme from E. coli (Hadener et al., 1993)]. It is possible to slow down the reaction velocity further by using, possibly in combination, mutant variants that show an altered

kinetic behaviour and can accumulate particular ESi complexes (Jordan & Woodcock, 1991; Lander et al., 1991), lower pH values like those needed to grow crystals of the enzyme, lower temperatures, and substrate concentrations below Km [for a detailed discussion, see Niemann et al. (1994) and Helliwell et al. (1998)]. Secondly, crystals of HMBS are relatively radiation-resistant to the monochromatic X-ray beam (as reported here). Also they are resistant to the `white' X-ray beam, illustrated by the fact that at ESRF ID09 (BL3) a total of 47 Laue exposures could be recorded from one HMBS crystal, each of 1 ms exposure time (Chayen et al., 1996). Furthermore, the enzyme active site is accessible to the solvent channels of the crystal and the time-dependent changes of electron density are expected to be substantial, as a number of aromatic rings should appear during a single catalytic cycle. We have applied Laue diffraction to establish the timedependent diffraction `titration' behaviour of crystals of [Lys59Gln]HMBS (Niemann et al., 1994) as they are exposed to substrate in a ¯ow cell (Helliwell et al., 1997). The re®ned HMBS MAD active structure has been used as the basis for a re®ned time-resolved structure of the mutant (Helliwell et al., 1998). Freeze trapping of the enzyme after soaking the crystals in substrate solution, guided by the Laue time-resolved sequence, are now being undertaken on this the active form of the enzyme.
