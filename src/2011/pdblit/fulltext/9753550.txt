Abstract--The first synthesis of Troger's base analogues bearing three and four atoms in the apical strap is reported, leading to a ¨ dramatic change in the shape of the aromatic scaffold with respect to the Troger's base framework. ¨ Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Troger's base1 1 is a rigid V-shaped compound that is ¨ chiral by virtue of the two stereogenic nitrogen atoms in the diazocine bridge (see Fig. 1). It was the first chiral tertiary amine to be successfully resolved as it is unable to undergo pyramidal inversion. Its resolution was achieved with what was perhaps the first example for the use of a chiral stationary phase.2

reacted with several aldehydes and a limited number of ketones to afford systems with a substituted methylene group in the strap.23­25 Molecular modelling studies predict that these alterations impart only minor changes on the overall shape of molecules and that the aromatic rings remain at an angle of approximately 90° with respect to one another. In the case of N-methylation an X-ray structure supports the modelling results.20 A more significant change is predicted if the number of atoms strapping the two bridgehead nitrogens is increased.26 The preparation of ethano-strapped 2,8-dimethyl and 2,8-dimethoxy Troger's base analogues, 2 ¨ and 3, respectively, was reported in 1996,27 (Scheme 1, R = CH3 or OCH3 and X = CH2CH2) and the same methodology was recently used to obtain an ethanostrapped 2,8-dibromo Troger's base 4 (Scheme 1, R = ¨ Br and X = CH2CH2).26 A recent report that treatment of a Troger's base analogue with activated acetylenes in ¨ the presence of ZnBr2 afforded a three-atom strapped compound28 has since been corrected, with the product found to be a functionalised methano-strapped analogue of Troger's base.29 ¨ We have initiated a study aimed at investigating the scope and limitations of the reaction of methanostrapped Troger's base analogues with dialkyl halides ¨

Compounds based on this framework are of interest because of their potential to function as artificial receptors3­10 and catalysts in asymmetric transformations.11,12 Troger's base analogues are produced as race¨ mic mixtures from an acid-catalysed condensation of anilines and formaldehyde and much of the chemistry of these systems has focussed on increasing the type of functionality on the aniline units.10,13­19 Although less numerous, modifications to the diazocine bridge region of Troger's base have also been reported. ¨ One of the bridgehead nitrogens can be alkylated,20,21 as can one, or both, of the benzylic methylene units.12,22 The apical methylene unit can also be removed and the resultant cyclic disecondary amines have been

were unsuccessful. In this instance no evidence of a Tro¨ ger's base material was observed in the 1H NMR spectra of crude reaction mixtures after work-up. In fact, only a minor percentage of the expected organic mass was recovered from the organic extracts. We believe this may be the result of a combination of two factors: firstly, mono-N-alkylation, which would give rise to the formation of salts and secondly, the possibility that 1,4-dibromobutane may serve as a dimerising/oligomerising unit via a reaction with nitrogen atoms of two different Troger's base molecules. ¨ A more rigid four-atom strap was incorporated successfully through the use of either a,a 0 -dibromo-o-xylene or 2,3-bis(bromomethyl)quinoxaline to afford 8 and 9 in yields of 40% and 38%, respectively. The double bond present as part of the aromatic rings removes one degree of freedom in comparison with a saturated C4 chain, making the final C­N bond formation and ring-closure reaction more entropically favourable. Compounds 4, 6, 8 and 9 were obtained as racemic mixtures and all retain the two stereogenic nitrogen centres present in the methano-strapped precursor. In fact, the resolution of 2 through diastereomeric salt formation has been previously reported.27 Having prepared a number of Troger's base derivatives ¨ with modified straps, we next compared their solid state structures with those predicted by molecular modelling studies. The X-ray crystal structure of methanostrapped 2,8-dibromo Troger's base 5 has been previ¨ ously reported and the two aromatic rings were found to be held at an angle of 94.5° with respect to one another.30 This dihedral angle lies within the range of 82°18 to 108°,31 which are the lower and upper limits that have been found across a range of simple methano-strapped dibenzo Troger's base analogues. An ¨ X-ray crystal structure of 4 revealed the equivalent dihedral angle to be 86.1° (Fig. 3). This is a reduction greater than 8° and is in agreement with the smaller cavity predicted by modelling studies (Fig. 2).32

(to afford strap-modifed analogues) by varying the substituent type, substituent position and the length of the dialkyl halides. Models of 2,8-dibromo Tro ¨ger's base 5 and its ethano-, propano- and butano-strapped derivatives, 4, 6 and 7, respectively, are shown in Figure 2. It is readily apparent that the ethano-strapped derivative 4 is predicted to have a tighter `bite-angle' than 5, whilst a strap length of either three or four atoms is predicted to essentially remove any cavity from the compounds. In the present work, methano-strapped 2,8-dibromo Tro ¨ger's base 5 was reacted separately with 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,3-dibromopropane, 1,4-dibromobutane, a,a 0 -dibromo-o-xylene and 2,3-bis(bromomethyl)quinoxaline according to the conditions outlined in Scheme 1 (R = Br). The reaction with 1,2-dibromoethane afforded 4 in 67% yield (Table 1), comparable with the reported yields of 2 (76%) and 3 (72%). An analogous reaction with 1,3-dibromopropane afforded 6 in a yield of only 10%. The poor yield of 6 was not unexpected as it involves the formation of an eight-membered ring (cf. the 6- and 7membered rings, incorporating the apical unit, that are present in methano- and ethano-strapped analogues, respectively). Attempts to incorporate an additional methylene unit in the strap with the use of 1,4-dibromobutane to afford 7

The addition of an extra methylene unit in the strap of 6 imparts a dramatic change on the shape of the molecule, effectively removing any cavity between the two aromatic rings as the molecule is `flattened out' (Fig. 4), again as predicted by modelling studies. The dihedral angle was determined to be 134.7° and the two aromatic rings are in a propeller-like orientation with respect to one another.32 This basic propeller-like shape is maintained in the o-xyleno- and 2 0 ,3 0 -dimethanoquinoxalino-strapped derivatives 8 and 9 (Figs. 5 and 6).32 In the case of compound 8, the dihedral angle between the two bromo-bearing aromatic rings was measured as 132.4° and a new cavity was created, with the xylenostrap forming one of the walls. The dihedral angle between the two walls of this new cavity was found to be 48.9°, whilst the corresponding angles in 9 were 127.0° and 52.1°. In the solid-state structures of 8 and 9, and to a lesser extent 6, it is apparent that the two bromo-bearing aromatic rings are no longer equivalent to one another as the strap is located over one of the aromatic rings. This phenomenon is not reflected in the solution-state NMR spectra of the compounds, where C2 symmetry typified by the methano- and ethano-strapped compounds 5 and 4 is readily apparent. 1H NMR spectra of 9 obtained at low temperature (218 K, CDCl3) did not exhibit any significant changes in comparison with spectra obtained at room temperature. This suggests that in

the solution state the compounds either adopt a C2 conformation or exist in a rapid equilibrium between two conformations in which the strap is able to flip from lying over one halogen-bearing ring to the other as illustrated in Figure 7 for compound 8. In summary, we have reported the first examples of Tro¨ ger's base analogues bearing three and four atom straps, and the first solid-state structures of Troger's base ana¨ logues bearing two, three and four atoms in the straps. The ability to alter the nature of the cavity in these systems will have implications for their application in the design of new catalysts and host-guest complexes. Investigations in both of these areas are underway in our laboratory and our findings will be reported in due course.
