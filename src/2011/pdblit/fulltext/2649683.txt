Role of residue packing in protein folding
Nagarajan Pattabiraman
In modern biology, the generation of three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins from their primary sequences has become critical for our understanding of not only the structure-function of proteins but also protein-protein interactions. In order to address this problem, it is essential to identify residues in the primary sequence that are in contact in the 3D protein structure. Distance-based and surface-based methods have been used to identify residues that are in contact for a given residue of a globular protein structure. In these methods, a data set of high-resolution, 3D, protein structures was used for the analysis. The purpose of these methods is to generate a residue­residue interaction preference value (potential) for each pair of amino acids. Finally, a method of identifying the residues in the primary sequence that might be in contact in the 3D fold of the protein is discussed. # 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The folding of proteins into their 3D native structures from their primary sequences is a challenging problem in modern biology. Recently, solving the protein-folding problem has become much more important, as more and more DNA sequences of genes have been identi¢ed by the Human Genome sequencing e¡orts. Many laboratories have been working on both theoretical and experimental aspects of the protein-folding problem. The fact that many naturally occurring proteins fold reliably and quickly to their native state despite the astronomical number of possible conformations has become known as ``Levinthal's Paradox'' [1]. For example, if we want to fold a protein of 50 amino acids, we have to generate 950 conformations (assuming 9 possible energetically favorable conformations for each amino acid) to identify the functional 3D folded protein structure. Even with the currently available supercomputers, it is not

possible to generate all possible 950 conformations. So, one has to use clever methods to generate the 3D structure of a protein from its primary sequence. Investigators using lattices [2^11] have simpli¢ed the representation of polypeptide chain for quick generation of all possible conformations. In the lattice methods, the side chains have not been explicitly considered, but each residue was represented only by a backbone atom (Ca) and assigned to be either a hydrophobic or a hydrophilic residue. It may be noted that the purpose of the lattice methods was to understand the statistical mechanics of the protein-folding processes rather than the generation of 3D structures. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to understand at the atomic level the folding and the unfolding reactions of proteins [12,13]. It may be noted that the molecular dynamics simulations are very computer intensive. Since the beginning of 1990s, structure-based ligand discovery and design approaches have been used to discover and optimize inhibitors that block the function of macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Currently, a total of more than 20,000 3D macromolecular structures have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank [14]. However, on analysis of number of new folds observed in protein structures during the last three years, it has been shown only a few new folds have been identi¢ed. Because of this, the 3D structures of proteins from their primary sequences have been built based on the homology of the target protein against a known crystal structure of a homologous protein. So, it is necessary to develop methods to identify folded versus misfolded protein structures. Also, mutagenesis studies have been routinely

Trends in Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 22, No. 9, 2003 carried out to understand the structure-function relationship of proteins. To address the above two issues, an analysis of packing of amino-acid residues in globular proteins using a set of high-resolution X-ray protein structures is essential. From the residue-residue contacts, a possible method to predict the 3D structure of a protein from the primary sequence is presented.

Trends algorithm to determine the error in packing between NMR-based and X-ray-based structures [21], free energy di¡erence between the wild-type and mutants of transmembrane helix dimers [22], and packing of a crystal structure of a DNA^protein complex [23]. The occluded surface area method not only identi¢es but also quanti¢es the residue^residue contacts. This method was further extended to identify the favorable and the unfavorable ligand-macromolecule contacts [24]. In this paper, a set of 48 high-resolution X-ray protein structures that are within 1.8 -- resolution and well re¢ned structures available in the Protein Data Bank were considered for our packing analysis. Only the monomer protein structures that do not contain any metal ions or other solvent molecules except water molecules or any other small molecules crystallized with the protein were considered for our analysis.

2. Extracting residues involved in packing Distance-based and surface-based methods have been used to identify residues that are packed against a given residue. Residue-residue contacts and the development of a potential mean force between amino acids were done using only the Ca^Ca distances [15]. However, the distance-based methods de¢ne interacting residues based on simple distance criteria without determination of shared contact surface. Another method that speci¢cally includes a consideration of residue packing environment is the 3D-pro¢le method, described by Luthy et al. [16]. The use of packing density as a criterion for evaluating model protein structures was developed explicitly by Gregoret and Cohen [17]. In their method, each amino-acid residue is approximated by spheres that are allowed to ``grow'' in size until contact with its neighboring sphere occurs. Recently, the occluded molecular surface algorithm was used to identify the residues involved in packing of a residue [18]. In this method, instead of the solventaccessible surface, the Connolly's van der Waals molecular surface (represented by dots with surface areas and normals [19]) for each residue was calculated in isolation without considering other neighboring residues in the protein structure. Then, the residues that are in contact were determined by the intersection of surface normal of each dot with the van der Waals spheres of other atoms in the surrounding residues that are within a distance of 6.5 -- from any atom in the residue with molecular surface. If a surface normal intersects with a van der Waals sphere of any atom in the surrounding residues, then the surface area associated with this dot is said to be occluded surface area. Otherwise, the surface area associated with this dot is said to be non-occluded surface area. The distance between the dot and the nearest intersecting point on the van der Waals sphere of the atom in the neighboring residue is de¢ned to be the packing parameter for each dot. By calculating the packing parameters for each occluded surface area, we quanti¢ed the closeness of these interacting surfaces. By calculating the weighted occluded surface area, which is the product of the occluded surface area and (1.0 packing parameter), we have used this method successfully to identify misfolded protein structures [18] and protein packing [20]. Other laboratories have used the occluded surface area-based

3. Packing of residues If a residue (Rj) occludes a surface area greater than 0.5 --2 of another residue (Ri), then the residue Rj is considered to be an occluding residue for the residue Ri. For each amino acid, we calculated the number of occluding residues and calculated the frequency of occluding residues for the entire data set. In Table 1, 20 amino acids are shown in the ¢rst column. In the subsequent columns, the frequencies of one residue, two residues, etc., occluding for each amino acid are listed. It is clear from Table 1 that the maximum number of occluding residues is 18 for the amino acids Phe and Tyr. Even for the amino acid with the smallest R group, hydrogen, as its side chain, Gly, the maximum number of occluding residues is 10; whereas, for the amino acid alanine, the maximum number of occluding residues is 13. For the amino acid lysine, the maximum number of occluding residues is 14; whereas, it is 17 for the amino acid arginine. From Table 1, the average numbers of occluding residues (packing) for each amino acid were calculated and plotted as a bar-graph in Fig. 1. From the average number of occluding residues, the 20 amino acids could be grouped into three categories, according to the average number of occluding residues: 1. between 4 and 6 (Gly, Asn, Asp, Ser, Lys and Gln); 2. between 6 and 8 (Glu, Pro, Thr, His, Cys, Ala and Arg); and, 3. between 8 and 10 (Val, Met, Leu, Ile, Tyr, Trp and Phe). For the third category, the amino acids are all hydrophobic. It is interesting to note that, for the proteinfolding simulations using lattice methods, the number of residues packing for all 20 amino acids was assumed

Trends to be the same. However, from our occluded surface area analysis, it is shown that the number of residues packing a given residue varies from 4 to 10 depending upon the size and chemical nature of the side chains of the residues in contact. On further analysis of the occluding residues, we found that most frequently two or three consecutive residues in the primary sequence occlude a part of the amino-acid residue.

This sum was further divided by the composition of amino acid Ri. The average residue-residue interaction preference for each amino-acid pair for the entire protein data set was calculated and is listed in Table 2. The ¢rst column shows the amino acids the molecular surfaces of which were considered for occlusion and each row is the residue-residue interaction preference values for the 20 amino acids that occlude the amino acid shown in the ¢rst column. Because we were using the Connolly's solvent-accessible van der Waals molecular surface for the amino acid considered for occlusion and the van der

As a result, Table 2 has to be used from left to right for each amino acid. For the amino acid alanine, it prefers leucine to the other hydrophobic amino acids, Val and Ile. Among the hydrophobic residues, the order of preference for the alanine residue is Phe, Ile and Trp. As expected, the amino acid arginine equally prefers the negatively charged amino acids Asp and Glu. It is interesting to note that, for the amino acid arginine, the amino-acid preference for the negatively charged Asp is same as that for leucine. This may be because of the hydrophobic interactions between the side chains of leucine and arginine, as it is known that Cys residue prefers another Cys residue because of the formation of a disulphide bond between them. The amino acid histidine prefers leucine to serine or Asp or Glu. It is interesting to note the amino acid proline prefers equally hydrophobic residues- alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine and tyrosine- to other amino acids. The amino acid glycine prefers all the amino acids except Cys, Trp and Met. The amino acid glutamic acid prefers lysine to arginine. The most preferred amino-acid residue for Gln is Leu and Tyr. The amino acid leucine is the most preferred amino acid for the hydrophobic amino acids, Val, Leu and Ile. Also, the most preferred amino acid for aromatic amino acids, Phe and Trp, is Leu. It is interesting to note that the ``stacking-like'' interaction between the hydrocarbon part of the positively charged amino acids, lysine and arginine, and the aromatic amino acids, Tyr, Trp and Phe, favors these amino-acid pairs to be in contact. The amino acids Ser

Trends and Thr prefer to interact with all the amino acids except Cys and Met. From the ratio between the weighted occluded and non-occluded surface areas, we have clearly demonstrated in our earlier studies that it is possible to identify misfolded protein structures. For each amino acid, we calculated the distance between the Ca atoms of the amino acid to be occluded and the amino acids occluding. Fig. 2 shows a histogram plot of the Ca^Ca distances between the amino acid alanine and the 20 amino acids. In Fig. 2b^d, a peak is observed around 6 -- (this corresponds to Ca-Ca distance equal to 6 -- but less than 7 --). The distribution is sort of symmetric for amino acids shown in Figs. 2b^c. The spread in Ca^Ca distance for the occluding residues is between 4 -- and 8 --. However, for aromatic side chains, the same spread is between 4 -- and 10 --. For the amino acid leucine, the plot is little asymmetric. Figs. 3a^d show the histograms of the Ca^Ca distance for the amino-acid residue Trp. Because of the bulkiness of Trp side chain, the spread for the Ca^Ca distance is between 5 -- and 15 --. These plots are not symmetrical. Because the shape of Trp side chain is not spherical, the packing of Leu against Trp side chain is asymmetrical. For most of the amino acids, the trend is either symmetrical or asymmetrical, except for proline for which two peaks are observed in the histogram of Ca^Ca distance. One major peak is at 6 -- and a minor peak at 4 --. The latter peak may be because the proline residues are involved in b-turns. For the amino acid leucine, two signi¢cant peaks were observed- one at 6 -- and the other at 9 --. It is clear that, if one uses only Ca atoms in the polypeptide chain to study the protein folding, the cut-

If we have a potential mean force that represents the interactions between amino acids only from Ca, this will enable us to identify faster the folded from the misfolded structures. If we invert the distribution shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the potential mean force between amino acids could be calculated without using all the side chain atoms. A novel method based on Ca atoms is outlined as follows. A number (N) of occluded amino acids will be randomly assigned to each amino acid using the frequency of occluding residue shown in Table 1. Based on the distribution of the frequency of occluded residues, a geometrical scoring is associated with each assignment. For example, if the number N is the maximum number in the distribution, a scoring of 100 will be assigned. If the number N is the minimum number in the distribution, a scoring of 0 will be assigned. We add up all the

In de-novo protein folding, one cannot use all atoms in the side chains because it takes computer time to evaluate each folded structure generated. Approximate representation of the polypeptide chains was used for protein-folding and packing studies [17,25]. However, these methods do not represent the true nature of the side chain and developing a potential mean force for these pseudo points from the known 3D

If the number falls between 70 and 80, the folding pattern will be considered for further evaluation. This measures the geometrical packing requirement of the amino acids in the ¢nal folded structure, as observed in the known protein structures. For each residue, based on the assigned number of occluded amino-acid residues, we randomly pick amino acids from the polypeptide chain to occlude this residue. Following Table 1, depending upon the nature of the side chain, the maximum number of times a residue is picked to occlude other residues in the polypeptide chain is determined. For example, the maximum number of times a valine residue is picked to occlude other residues is 14, while it is 18 for phenylalanine residue. For each con¢guration of the residues occluding, the total protein-folding score is calculated by summing the

Trends residue-residue preference values shown in Table 2 for each amino-acid pairs. Using Monte Carlo and Genetic algorithms, a number of con¢gurations of possible protein folds could be generated and the top 100 best con¢gurations could be kept to generate 3D structure using distance geometry techniques and the Ca^Ca distances histograms shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

6. Summary The application of the surface area-based method is useful for analyzing the packing of the 20 commonly occurring amino acids in folded globular protein structures. The number of residues that pack a given amino acid very much depends on the size and the chemical property of side chains. The maximum number of occluding residues varies from 10 for glycine amino

Based on the contacts between the residues, residueresidue interaction preference values have been developed. Using the preference values and the distribution of occluding residues for each residue, a method is outlined to identify in the primary sequence the residues that might be in contact in the folded 3D structure.
