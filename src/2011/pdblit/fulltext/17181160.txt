Human coagulation factor XIa (FXIa), a serine protease activated by site-specific cleavage of factor XI by thrombin, FXIIa, or autoactivation, is a critical enzyme in the amplification phase of the coagulation cascade. To investigate the potential of FXIa inhibitors as safe anticoagulants, a series of potent, selective peptidomimetic inhibitors of FXIa were designed and synthesized. Some of these inhibitors showed low nanomolar FXIa inhibitory activity with >1000-fold FXa selectivity and >100-fold thrombin selectivity. The X-ray structure of one of these inhibitors, 36, demonstrates its unique binding interactions with FXIa. Compound 32 caused a doubling of the activated partial thromboplastin time in human plasma at 2.4 µM and was efficacious in a rat model of venous thrombosis. These data suggest that factor XIa plays a significant role in venous thrombosis and may be a suitable target for the development of antithrombotic therapy.
Introduction A well-balanced and highly regulated hemostatic process is essential to normal physiology. The overproduction of thrombin may lead to vascular occlusion as a consequence of many cardiovascular diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The inappropriate down-regulation of thrombin generation may also cause hemorrhagic problems.1,2 Thus far, none of the available therapies for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders are ideal. The most commonly used anticoagulants, heparin and warfarin, require very careful and costly monitoring to ensure safe therapeutic drug levels for the duration of treatment because of the high risk of bleeding. Warfarin and other coumarins, the only orally administered anticoagulants, often exhibit drug-drug and fooddrug interactions due to their erratic plasma concentration and anticoagulant effects.3 Heparin also has variable effects due to its nonspecific binding with multiple coagulation factors in the system.4 In addition, a small population of patients can develop an autoimmune syndrome known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).5 Clearly, there is a strong medical need for a well-tolerated, efficacious anticoagulant with a wide therapeutic window. To address this need, a significant focus within the pharmaceutical industry for decades has been the development of potent and selective inhibitors of the coagulation enzymes to replace heparin and warfarin. Among the coagulation enzymes, thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa (FXa) have received the most attention due to their multiple functions and key roles in the final common pathway in the blood coagulation cascade. Some direct thrombin inhibitors and FXa inhibitors have been evaluated in phase III clinical trials or have been licensed in North America or Europe for limited indications. However, all of these new anticoagulants are still associated with bleeding problems and have no significant improvement in efficacy-to-safety index compared with heparin or warfarin in many studies (reviewed in refs 6 and 7).

new trend in the development of antithrombotic agents is to explore inhibitors targeting the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex,8,9 factor IXa,10 factor XIa,11,12 carboxypeptidase U (thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, TAFIa),13 or agents that enhance activated protein C that in turn inactivates factor Va and VIIIa.14 The roles of factor XI in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and its thrombin-mediated feedback activation were not fully understood until the early 1990s.15 Thrombin formation can occur via activation of the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway of coagulation. In the extrinsic pathway, thrombin generation is initiated by exposure of blood to the tissue factor/activated factor VII (FVIIa) complex. This complex activates clotting factors X and IX (proteolysis rate of FX . FIX), leading to the generation of thrombin and the formation of fibrin.16 This pathway is usually rapidly shut down by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and anti-thrombin III. To maintain normal hemostasis, thrombin-mediated activation of FXI initiates an amplification phase via the intrinsic pathway. Activated factor XI (FXIa) continues to activate factor IX and then factor X, resulting in the formation of additional thrombin, which takes place inside the fibrin clot. This additional thrombin may be required for the activation of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) to protect fibrin clots against lysis.17 Therefore, the role of FXI in hemostasis can be considered as a combination of procoagulant and antifibrinolytic actions, which is critical to the consolidation of blood coagulation when tissue factor is not available.18 Hypothetically, a specific inhibition of FXIa, which is involved only in the amplification phase via the intrinsic pathway, represents an attractive strategy for novel antithrombotic agents. Specific inhibitors of FXIa might inhibit thrombosis without completely interrupting the function of normal hemostasis and, thus, might prevent or minimize the risk of hemostasis complication. Deficiencies in factors VIII and IX can cause hemophilia A and B, respectively, whereas genetic FXI deficiency results in only a mild-to-moderate bleeding disorder.19 High levels of FXI have been demonstrated as risk factors for venous thrombosis20 and acute myocardial infarction.21 Recently, our hypothesis has been supported by a ferric chloride (FeCl3)

induced arterial injury mouse model,22 where both FXI- and FIX-deficient mice were fully or partially protected from occlusion depending on the concentration of FeCl3. However, FXI-deficient and wild-type mice were shown to have similar bleeding time, whereas FIX deficiency was associated with severely prolonged bleeding time. Furthermore, anti-FXI antibodies were shown to reduce both clot size and bleeding time in a baboon model of thrombosis23 and to enhance fibrinolysis in a rabbit model.17b Interestingly, therapy using recombinant VIIa on a patient with a FXI/FXIa inhibitor has been found to be effective and safe, ensuring adequate hemostasis without thrombotic complication.24 Inhibitor Design Due to the lack of literature precedents of FXIa inhibitors, the starting point of our search for potent and selective inhibitors of FXIa was initially based on two known thrombin inhibitors, leupeptin (L-Leu-Leu-ArgCHO)25 and PPACK (D-Phe-ProArgCH2Cl).26 We used tripeptides as templates to interact with the S1, S2, and S3 pockets of the enzyme and further elaborated the C terminus and N terminus of the tripeptides to gain more specific interactions with our target enzyme. We first chose to synthesize a number of arginine derivatives, 1, as shown in Chart 1, with activated electrophilic carbonyl groups such as an R-ketothiazole that has a well-characterized covalent interaction with Ser195,27 in which the Arg-R-ketothiazole component served as the P1-P1 template. P2 and P3 components were initially selected from hydrophobic residues, including Phe, Val (as replacement of Thr), Leu, Ile, Pro, Ala, and Tyr, as the corresponding non-prime sequences of the two scissile FIX substrate sites contain hydrophobic P2 and P3 subunits (Chart 2). The X-ray crystal structure of a FXIa-ecotin complex28a also provided us with a comprehensive understanding of the FXIa active site to guide our inhibitor design.

Chemistry A combination of solid- and solution-phase synthesis was utilized to prepare a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors as shown in Schemes 1-4. The dipeptide cores, designed as P2-P3 components, were readily constructed on Wang resin by employing a 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) coupling strategy. The elaboration of the N terminus with various acylating reagents such as acid chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides and isocyanates was carried out in the final step on solid support, followed by a standard TFA cleavage protocol to yield a variety of dipeptido precursors, 5a-5c (Scheme 1). As an alternative to the isocyanate approach (method A), N-terminal ureas were also synthesized by reaction of the amine terminus of the resin with p-nitrophenylchloroformate (5-10 equiv) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), followed by the addition of excess (5-10 equiv) primary or secondary amine. In one example, the resin-supported p-nitrophenylcarbonate dipeptide was treated with (R)-1-(4-bromophenyl)ethylamine to provide resin-supported compound 4d. Optically pure isomer 5d was readily obtained after cleavage with 50% TFA in dichloromethane (method B shown in Scheme 2). The R-ketothiazole derivative, 6, was prepared in three steps from commercial Boc-NH-Arg(Mtr)-OH as described by Berryman et al.29 (Scheme 3). Coupling of acids 5a-d with R-ketothiazole, 6, using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)/1-(3dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) chemistry and subsequent deprotection of the 2,3,6-trimethyl4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl (Mtr) group under strong acidic conditions (95% TFA/2.5% thioanisole/2.5% water) yielded peptidomimetics 1a-d (Scheme 4).

Results and Discussion The lead compound, 7, emerged from the early exploration of the P4 component using Phe-Val-Arg-R-ketothiazole as P3P2-P1-P1 template (Table 1). Incorporation of various isocyanates, acid chlorides, and sulfonyl chlorides on the N terminus generated urea-linked, amide-linked, and sulfonamide-linked R4 substitutions, respectively. Compounds with urea-linked R4 substitutions such as compounds 7-10 showed superior potency against FXIa, compared with those compounds with amide- or sulfonamide-linked R4 substitutions (12-14). Compound 7, with a 3,4-dichlorobenzyl urea link, exhibits potent FXIa activity with an IC50 of 90 nM and good selectivity over thrombin (72-fold) and FXa (153-fold). The potency loss of compound 11, which has a rigid phenyl urea R4 component, indicates that a flexible spacer group such as -CH2- or -CH2CH2- in urea-linked R4 elements is needed for FXIa binding affinity.

Another lead compound, 15, from the Leu-Val-Arg-Rketothiazole sublibrary, also displayed potent FXIa activity with an IC50 of 63 nM (Table 2). Starting from lead compound 15, we explored the SAR of P2 groups by fixing the 3,4dichlorobenzyl urea-linked R4 component. As shown in Table 2, FXIa appears to prefer a relatively small, branched hydrophobic group such as Val, Leu, or Ileu in its S2 pocket. Compounds 15 and 16 showed not only potent inhibitory properties against FXIa (IC50 ) 63 and 76 nM, respectively) but also decent selectivity over FXa (for 16, >1000-fold) and thrombin (for 16, 34-fold). Highly branched, larger R2 groups such as cyclohexyl, Phe, and tBu (18, 19, and 21, respectively) or a very small group such as Ala (20) displayed weaker FXIa affinity. However, the larger Tyr residue at the P2 position (17) showed unexpectedly good binding affinity for FXIa with an IC50 of 200 nM. The p-hydroxyl group in the Tyr residue of 17

may interact with Glu 98 in the small S2 loop of FXIa (see the detailed structure information of FXIa28). Taking advantage of solid- and solution-phase synthesis technologies, we were able to quickly optimize R3 and R4 elements in parallel (Tables 3-5). As shown in Table 3, the racemic 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethyl urea at the R4 position (22) gave the best FXIa potency (IC50 ) 10 nM) and good FXa (1500-fold) and thrombin (140-fold) selectivity in this series. The dichloro substitution at the benzyl phenyl ring was found to be favored by FXIa when the activities of compounds 15 and 23 were compared to those of 24 and 25. Replacement of the urea linkage of compound 25 with carbamate analogue 26 resulted in a 2-3-fold loss in potency. Truncation of the R4 element, such as in compound 27, reduced the potency dramatically. The stereochemistry of the R-methyl benzyl substituent of 22 was also studied. The inhibitory activity against FXIa of the compounds with an (R)-configuration such as 28 and 30 is

10-20-fold enhanced compared with the corresponding (S)diastereomeric isomers 29 and 31, respectively (Table 4). The selectivity of 28 and 30 over FXa and thrombin is also 2-17fold better than that of the (S)-isomers 29 and 31. Further efforts to explore the SAR of the R3 elements are shown in Table 5. Either hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues at the R3 position demonstrated excellent potency against FXIa. Hydrophobic residues had better selectivity over FXa and thrombin such as 22 and 28. Compounds with less hydrophobic R3 residues such as 32 and 37 showed less selectivity over FXa (200-fold); however, residues with the most hydrophilicity at R3, for example, 33, significantly reduced the selectivity against both FXa and thrombin (Table 5). Some of the above potent compounds were selected and tested in in vitro clotting assays. The concentration needed to cause a doubling of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the prothrombin time (PT) in human plasma in vitro was

determined for each compound (see Table 6). Most compounds required only submicro- to low micromolar concentrations in coagulation (2× aPTT) assays and 10-50-fold higher concentrations in the 2× PT assay. The results indicated that potency in the aPTT versus the PT is consistent with the high level of specificity for FXIa over thrombin or FXa as determined by the biochemical assay. Compound 28 resulted in a significant loss of potency in both coagulation assays, likely due to poor solubility rendered by the lipophilic cyclohexyl group at R3. The X-ray crystal structure of 36 in complex with FXIa exemplifies how this series of potent inhibitors interact with FXIa (Figure 1). A detailed scheme of the key binding interactions of 36 with FXIa is described in Chart 3. As expected, the arginine of 36 forms a bidentate interaction with Asp189 in the S1 pocket similar to the FXIa-ecotinM84R structure.28a The C-terminal thiazole binds in the S1 pocket: the nitrogen of thiazole forms a hydrogen bond with His57; the ketocarbon is covalently bound to the hydroxyl group of Ser195. The valine residue of 36 fits in the S2 pocket. The P3 component, a citrulline side chain, unexpectedly binds in the S4 pocket, instead of the S3 site, but does not have any direct polar interactions with the S4 pocket of FXIa. Interestingly, the (R)-1-(4-bromophenyl)ethyl urea substituent interacts with Lys192 of FXIa by hydrophobic packing between the phenyl group and the lysine side chain. The (R)-configuration of this substituent enables the right orientation for the phenyl group to make such contact. This explains why the (R)-isomers are

substantially more potent and selective than the (S)-isomers (Table 4). In addition, there are hydrogen-bonding interactions between the urea CdO group, the Val CdO group (P2), and N of Lys192 (see Figure 1). These key interactions are most likely responsible for the observed improvement in potency and selectivity. Compared with other trypsin-like coagulation enzymes, only FXIa and FVIIa have a lysine at position 192.28 As shown in the X-ray crystal structure of 36, Lys192 may be a key selectivity element for FXIa. The IC50 values of 32 versus selected serine proteases are shown in Table 7. Compound 32 showed good selectivity versus thrombin (340-fold), FXa (267-fold), FVIIa (>6000-fold), and activated protein C (APC, >3000-fold), but poor selectivity over plasma kallikrein and trypsin (both only 2-fold). In addition to potency and selectivity, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile of 32 via intravenous administration to rats. Compound 32 displayed relatively high clearance (32 mL/kg/min), a short half-life (t1/2 of 45 min), and a low volume of distribution (Vdss  236 mL/kg). To test the importance of factor XI in clot formation in vivo, we used an established rat model of venous thrombosis.30,31 In this model, a hypotonic insult is used to induce clot formation in the inferior vena cava. To test for potential species specificity, we investigated the ability of 32 to affect the aPTT and PT in rat plasma (data in human plasma, see Table 6). Compound 32 was 10-fold less effective at prolonging rat aPTT than human aPTT. In rat plasma, 25 µM 32 was required to yield a doubling

of the aPTT, whereas >120 µM was required to double the PT. This was most likely a direct effect on factor XI as shown by the fact that the IC50 of this compound for recombinant rat FXI catalytic domain was also 10-fold higher than the IC50 for the human enzyme.32 Despite the lower potency against the rat enzyme, continuous intravenous administration of 32 suppressed thrombus formation in the inferior vena cava induced by rapid infusion of hypotonic saline followed by partial stenosis in the rat (Figure 2). Administration of 32 commenced 5 min prior to thrombus induction, with determination of thrombus mass at 10 min postchallenge. Efficacy was observed at a total dose exposure of 0.25 mg/kg. The extent of the reduction is comparable to that obtained with heparin given as an intravenous bolus of 50 units/kg followed by continuous infusion at 25 units/ kg/h. Similar results were obtained with 37 (data not shown). Compound 37 was also tested in a rat mesenteric arteriole bleeding model.31,35,36 When administered at up to 4 times the efficacious dose (1 mg/kg), 37 did not alter the bleeding time, whereas heparin, at a dose comparable to the clinically relevant dose, significantly increased bleeding (Figure 3). Conclusion A series of potent, selective peptidomimetic inhibitors of FXIa have been designed and synthesized. Some of these inhibitors

showed low nanomolar FXIa inhibitory activity with >1000fold FXa selectivity and >100-fold thrombin selectivity. The X-ray structure of the inhibitor, 36, demonstrates its unique binding with FXIa. In vivo efficacy of 32 was demonstrated in a rat model of venous thrombosis. The results presented in this paper clearly suggest that FXIa plays a significant role in clot formation and/or maintenance and that it is a suitable target for the development of novel antithrombotic agents.

The yellow solid was dried under vacuum overnight to yield 720 mg of deprotected product 1 with a ratio of 2.3:1.0 mixture of the desired and undesired isomers. This crude mixture was purified by preparative HPLC to give the desired isomer with purity >95%. Enzyme Affinity and Anticoagulant Activity. Inhibition Assay (IC50). Peptidolytic activities for thrombin, trypsin, and factor XIa were measured using a fluorogenic reporter group, 7-methyl-4-aminocoumarin (AMC), attached via an amide linkage to the custom tripeptide pyroglutamic acid-prolinearginine (Glp-Pro-Arg). Commercially available substrate, HPro-Phe-Arg-AMC (BACHEM I-1295), was used for FXa activity. All assays were carried out in a Tris buffer (100 mM

Tris-HCl/200 mM NaCl and 0.02% Tween 20) at pH 7.4. Enzyme and substrate concentrations were 50 nM and 50 µM, respectively, for thrombin, trypsin, and factor XIa. Factor Xa required twice the concentrations. For all of the enzymes but factor Xa, the 10-point dose-response assays were run as endpoints after 15-30 min of incubation at 30 °C. Factor Xa required a longer, 60 min incubation time. Released AMC was measured at an emission wavelength of 460 nm on a Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter excited at 355 nm using a continuous source. The data were fit to a dose-response one-site model using a nonlinear least-squares algorithm to determine the IC50 and Hill coefficient. Human Plasma Based Clotting Assay. aPTT Assay. To determine the effect of compounds on coagulation pathway, activated partial thromboplastin time was determined using a Thromboscreen 400C instrument. This pathway involves FXII, kallikrein, and FXI, which activates factors IX and FVIII, leading to activation of FX and FV and then activation of factor II to form a blood clot. Plasma (50 µL) and different concentrations of compounds were added to cuvettes. After incubation for 2 min, aPTT reagent (ALEXIN, Sigma) was added (50 µL) and incubated for an additional 3 min. The cuvettes were transferred to a measuring position,and prewarmed CaCl2 reagent (50 µL, 30 mM) was added. Readings were then taken over a maximum of 300 s. A dose-response curve was generated, and the concentration at which the clotting time was doubled (2× aPTT) was determined. PT Assay. The PT assay was also used to measure inhibition of coagulation. In this assay, the factor XI dependent steps are bypassed. Hence, the assay measures inhibition of factor VIIa, factor Xa, and thrombin, but not FXI. This assay measures the ability of factor VIIa to activate factor X, which activates factor II to form a blood clot. The assay was performed using a Thromboscreen 400C instrument and thromboplatin reagent (ThromboMax with calcium, Sigma). Plasma (50 µL) and compounds were prewarmed at 37 °C for 3 min in the cuvettes. The cuvettes were transferred to the measuring position. The prewarmed thromboplastin reagent (100 µL) was then added, and readings were taken over 300 s. A dose-response curve was generated, and the concentration at which the clotting time was doubled (2× PT) was determined. Rat Model of Venous Thrombosis. An established rat model of venous thrombosis was used to assess the antithrombotic potential of FXI inhibitors. Briefly, under anesthesia a stenosis of the inferior vena cava with rapid infusion of hypotonic saline followed by reduced blood flow was used to induce clot formation.29,30 Rats were treated with vehicle alone (0.1 M NaOAc, pH 4.0), 32 at 0.0625 or 0.25 mg/kg intravenous infusion, or heparin (50 units/kg by intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 25 units/kg/h). Following a treatment time of 10 min, the clot was isolated and weighed. The thrombus weight in both the 0.25 mg/kg 32 and heparin-treated groups was significantly reduced compared to that found in the vehicletreated animals (p < 0.05, n ) 9, Tukey-Kramer multiplecomparison test) (see Supporting Information for complete experimental details). Rat Mesenteric Arteriole Bleeding Time. The rat model used was modified from established techniques.31,35,36 Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with ketamine/ xylazine. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C. Compounds were administered through a catheter implanted in the left femoral vein. A small portion of the small intestine was exteriorized to display the mesenteric artery. Three arterioles branching from the mesenteric artery were punctured with a

30G needle while being superfused with saline at 37 °C. Bleeding time was determined as cessation of blood flow from the puncture sites. After the intestines were replaced, vehicle or heparin was administered as an intravenous bolus injection followed by continuous infusion via the femoral vein. Compound 37 was administered as a continuous infusion only. Fifteen minutes after the start of infusion, another small portion of the small intestine was exteriorized, and again three arterioles were punctured with a 30G needle and flushed with saline at 37 °C to determine bleeding time. The animals were then sacrificed by an anesthetic overdose. Bleeding time from mesenteric arterioles was determined in each animal prior to compound administration and then after 15 min of continuous infusion. Compound infusion was continued during the determination of bleeding time. Animals with bleeding times of >210 s prior to compound administration were excluded from the study. If bleeding time was >9 min, the time was assumed to be 9 min for calculation purposes. Protein Purification and X-ray Crystallography. The detailed expression and purification procedure of the mutated catalytic domain of FXIa (rhFXI370-607-S434A,T475A,C482S,K437A, hereinafter FXIac) and the crystallization method for the FXIac-benzamidine complex has been published.28b Compound 36 was added to a drop of crystallization solution (2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) in powder form. A FXIac-benzamidine crystal was soaked in the compound 36 containing solution overnight at 10 °C. After soaking, the crystal was briefly put into cryoprotection solution containing crystallization solution with 20% (v/v) glycerol before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a RAXIS-IV++ image plate with an RU-H3R rotating anode X-ray source (Rigaku) equipped with blue Osmic mirrors and X-stream 2000 system (Rigaku). Data indexing, processing, and scaling were performed with HKL2000.34 The structure of FXIaccompound 36 was solved using the structure of FXIac complexed with benzamidine (PDB code 1ZHR) with benzamidine and water molecules removed from the initial model. Refinement and difference maps were calculated by CNX (Accelrys), and ligand placement and manual rebuilding of FXIac were performed using QUANTA (Accelrys). The final model contains residues 370-606 of factor XI (residues 16-244 using chymotrypsin numbering), 128 water molecules, and the bound ligand. The crystal structure of 36 was refined to an R of 20.7% and an Rfree of 22.6% at 2.25 Å resolution (PDB code 1ZOM).
