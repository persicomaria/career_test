Skp2 is the substrate recognition subunit of the multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase SCFSkp2. It consists of an N-terminal F-box domain that binds to the Skp1 subunit and thereby tethers it to the SCF catalytic core, and an elongated C-terminal domain comprising ten Leucine-rich repeats (LRR) that binds the substrate. A small accessory protein, Cks1, is required for SCFSkp2 to target certain substrates, including the Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Here we have used hydrogen/deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry to investigate the mode of action of Cks1 on SCFSkp2. We show that complex formation between Cks1 and Skp2 causes conformational changes in both proteins in regions distant from the respective binding sites. We find that Skp2 interacts with a localised region of Cks1 but the interaction causes a global change in the hydrogen exchange behaviour of Cks1. Also, whilst Cks1 binds to the most C-terminal LRRs of the elongated Skp2 molecule, the interaction induces conformational changes at the distant N-terminal LRRs, close to the F-box motif. Further, binding of Cks1 to Skp2 significantly stabilises the interaction between Skp2 and Skp1. The results reveal that the C-terminal substrate recognition region of Skp2 is coupled to the N-terminal Skp1-binding region and thereby to the SCF catalytic core; this result adds to the model proposed previously that, whilst the principal function of the F-box protein is to recruit the substrate, an additional function may be to help position the substrate in an optimal way within the SCF complex to enable efficient ubiquitin transfer.

Introduction
Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) complexes are a large family of E3 ubiquitin ligases consisting of three constant subunits (ROC1 or Rbx1, Cullin-1 and Skp1) and a variable substrate recognition subunit known as the F-box protein. F-box proteins have an

N-terminal 40-residue F-box motif that binds Skp1, followed by protein­protein interaction motifs such as leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and WD-40 repeats that bind the substrate. SCF complexes use the F-box proteins in a combinatorial manner to recruit various cell cycle regulators and transcription factors, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome.1 Most SCF substrates need to be phosphorylated, but there does not appear to be any other common sequence or structural motif on the substrate that is recognised. Several substrates of the human SCFSkp2 complex (the superscript denoting the F-box protein) have been identified to date, including the inhibitors of the S-phase Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk2), p27, p57 and p21, and the transcription factor c-Myc.1 Understanding the molecular mechanism of degradation of p27 is of particular importance because low levels of p27, associated with its enhanced

The tail of Skp2 packs loosely against the LRRs' concave face. Contacts are mostly between the C-terminal half of the tail and the -strands of the six N-terminal LRRs. In particular, the last few amino acid residues of the tail form a -strand, S12, that packs with the strand S1 immediately preceding the first LRR. It is the N-terminal half of the tail and the C-terminal LRRs that contact the helices and H1­H2 loop of the Cks1 molecule.

Cks1, to ubiquitinate some of its substrates, including p27.4­6 The crystal structure of the complex of Skp1, Skp2, Cks1 and a phosphopeptide derived from p27 reveals that Cks1 binds to the C-terminal LRRs and the unstructured C-terminal tail of Skp2.7 Skp2 and Cks1 together create a bimolecular site that binds to p27 (Figure 1(a)). However, there are surprisingly few residues within p27 that make contacts with Skp2-Cks1, raising the question of how substrate specificity is achieved. We and others showed previously that Cks1 binds Skp2, Cdk2 and p27 in a cooperative manner, suggesting that the function of Cks1 in activating SCFSkp2 may be exerted not only through an effect on Skp2 but also through its interaction with Cdk2; thus high affinity and specificity of substrate binding is achieved through the sum of many, relatively weak interactions (Figure 1(c)).8,9 Further, by presenting p27 in a complexed form, Skp2 and Cks1 may help to orient the substrate more specifically within the SCF for efficient ubiquitin transfer. Here we use hydrogen/deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry, together with other biophysical techniques, to investigate further how Skp2 is regulated by Cks1. In the hydrogen exchange approach, protein is incubated in 2H2O to allow exchange of protons with solvent deuterons, and the extent and rate of exchange are detected by mass spectrometry. Those protons at sites that are exposed on the protein surface and therefore accessible to the solvent will exchange rapidly; those protons at sites that are protected from solvent, either because they are buried in the interior of the protein or in regions of low flexibility, or because they are in contact with a ligand, will exchange more slowly. Thus, hydrogen exchange allows interaction surfaces to be mapped and also provides a picture of the fluctuations of the

protein and the changes in these dynamic properties upon ligand binding. The results presented here are consistent with recent studies showing that Cks1 binds to the C-terminal LRRs of Skp2,7,10 and they reveal that Cks1 exerts a long-range effect at the other end of the Skp2 molecule close to the F-box motif that binds Skp1. We subsequently investigated the effects of Cks1 binding on the Skp2/Skp1 complex and found that the binding of Cks1 to Skp2 significantly stabilises the Skp2/Skp1 interaction. Finally, although Skp2 contacts a very localised region of the Cks1 structure, the interaction causes a global change in the hydrogen exchange behaviour of Cks1. Our findings add further detail to the complex mechanism emerging by which Cks1 participates in the function of the ubiquitin ligase SCFSkp2.

Results
Binding of Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 Experiments were carried out first to confirm the binding of Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 under the conditions used for hydrogen exchange (Skp2 and Skp1 were co-expressed and subsequently purified as a complex; see Materials and Methods). A solution containing Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 in ammonium acetate buffer was subjected to nano-electrospray (nano-ES) analysis and the spectrum is shown in Figure 2(a). A series of peaks was observed in the spectrum with a calculated mass of 67,653 Da, corresponding to the Cks1-Skp2/Skp1 ternary complex (theoretical mass 67,645 Da). The narrow peak-width and the good agreement between the theoretical and observed masses suggest that the

The minor charge state series (<5% relative abundance) at m/z range of 5000­ 6500 Da correspond to the dimeric form of the ternary complex. ESI mass spectra recorded for Cks1 (charge states 2+ to 9+) (b) and Skp2/Skp1 (charge states 15+ to 18+) (c) after 1:30 dilution into 2 H2O (repeated three times) and incubation overnight. The deuteron incorporation is calculated as 100% and 99% for Cks1 and Skp2/ Skp1, respectively. The spectrum of the Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 complex (a) was acquired on a LCT instrument (Micromass, UK) at a capillary voltage of 1600 V and a cone voltage of 150 V. Pressures of 9.3 mBar and 7.3 × 10- 7 mBar were used in the ion source region and mass analyser region, respectively. For the deuterated proteins ((b) and (c)) a closed nanospray source was used under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen to achieve minimal back exchange within the source region, with a cone voltage of 200 V and an ion source pressure of 6 mBar.

Cks1-Skp2/Skp1 complex is bound without trapping of any small molecules or ions.11,12 Investigation by gel filtration chromatography also shows that, similar to what is observed in Tris-HCl buffer, a peak corresponding to Cks1-Skp2/Skp1 complex was observed for solutions of Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 in ammonium acetate buffer within the buffer concentration range used in this study (data not shown). To confirm that complete exchange of protons for deuterons takes place in Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 mass spectra were recorded in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen and the results confirm incorporation of 100% and 99% deuterium, respectively. Overall therefore these results demonstrate the formation of the 1:1 complex of Cks1 with Skp2/Skp1, under the conditions used for hydrogen exchange, and that the level of deuteration is greater than 99% prior to the hydrogen exchange experiments. Identifying peptic digestion products Prior to hydrogen exchange experiments, nondeuterated Cks1, Skp2/Skp1 and the Cks1-Skp2/ Skp1 complex were digested for assignment of peptic peptides to the primary sequences of the proteins. A typical spectrum for peptic digestion products of Skp2/Skp1 is shown in Figure 3. Each peptide ion was subjected to MS/MS for sequence assignment. Over 50 peptide ions were identified for Skp2 and Skp1, some of which belong to the same peptides but are in different charge states. Ten peptides are assigned from Skp1, covering 29% of the sequence (Supplementary Figure 1). A total of 30 peptides were assigned from Skp2, corresponding to a sequence coverage of 58%

(Figure 4). The reduced coverage of Skp1 compared to Skp2 may arise from the suppression effect of Skp2 and/or low susceptibility of Skp1 to peptic digestion. For Cks1, six peptides were identified from the spectra for the digestion products of the ternary complex, covering 89% of the sequence (Figure 4). Hydrogen exchange measurements Hydrogen exchange was carried out on Cks1 or Skp2/Skp1 alone, and on the Cks1-Skp2/Skp1 complex. Each exchanged solution was subjected to peptic digestion and then analysis by nano-ES. The exchange behaviour of peptides from individual proteins was compared with those from the complex. In the first instance exchange was monitored by a tenfold dilution of the deuterated protein into H2O (known as an exchange-off experiment). For peptides identified from Skp1 there was no significant difference in exchange behaviour between Skp2/Skp1 alone and the Cks1-Skp2/Skp1 complex (data not shown). Therefore, upon binding of Cks1 to Skp2/ Skp1 there is no change in conformation of the limited regions of Skp1 that could be observed in the experiments. By contrast however mass spectra for peptide ions m/z 722.05, identified as residues 149­167 from Skp2 show significant differences (Figure 5). In the absence of Cks1, after 2 min of exposure to H2O, deuterons on these residues are replaced by hydrogen atoms, leading to a reduction in m/z value. This exchange behaviour is markedly different from that observed in the presence of Cks1, where a number of deuterons on Skp2 are retained even after 30 min

exchange. These results indicate therefore that the exchange rate of the Skp2 residues 149­167 is much faster in the absence of Cks1 than in the ternary complex. Skp2 binding increases solvent protection throughout the Cks1 structure Plotting deuterons retained against exchange time allows us to obtain the kinetics of exchange for each peptide. For example plots for peptide ion m/z 465.69, corresponding to residues 69­79 of Cks1, are shown in Figure 5. By fitting the kinetic data to the sum of three exponentials, the numbers of deuterons in fast exchange, intermediate exchange and slow exchange can be obtained (Table 1) (see Materials and Methods). Solvent accessibility can also be estimated by the percentage of the sum of deuterons for fast and intermediate exchange divided by the total number of amide hydrogen atoms involved in the exchange. This value reflects the extent of exposure of the amino acid sequence to solvent within the 30 min exchange time. For the N-terminal residues 1­ 16, containing the first strand of the -sheet, no change in solvent accessibility was observed upon complexation. For the five other segments of Cks1, i.e. residues 17­37, 38­42, 43­53, 58­68 and 69­79, a significant decrease in solvent accessibility was observed in the presence of Skp2/Skp1. Previous studies using site-directed mutagenesis6 have demonstrated that residues 29, 31, 41 and 45, located in the -helices, are involved in binding to Skp2. Our

results are consistent with these observations since the most significant changes were obtained for Cks1 residues 17­37, 38­42 and 43­53, the three peptides that include residues in the Skp2-binding site. For residues 17­37, although the change in solvent accessibility was not as significant as it was for the other residues, the numbers for both intermediate and slow exchange significantly increased in the presence of Skp2/Skp1, and in total an average of 5.1 deuterons in this region show slowed exchange rates in the complex. The location of the Skp2-binding site was further confirmed by mutational analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The mutation of residues Ser41 and Asn45 in the -helices of Cks1 abrogates the interaction with Skp2 (Figure 8(a)­(c)), whereas mutations in the -sheet region (WF54 and RK20PA62) do not alter the affinity for Skp2. Our results show that, additionally, residues not involved in Skp2 binding, namely 58­68 and 69­79 encompassing -strands 3 and 4 and the C terminus of Cks1, also have slowed exchange rates in the complex. The protected regions are shown mapped onto the protein structure in Figure 7(a). The exchange behaviour of the intact Cks1 protein was also monitored. In the absence of Skp2/Skp1, the exchange was very fast and was complete within 2 min (Figure 5). In the presence of Skp2/Skp1, the rate of exchange was significantly slowed. About 14 deuterons showed slowed exchange rates, close to the value of 12.1 obtained from the sum of the slowed deuterons from the six Cks1 peptides. This result is consistent with that obtained for Cks1 peptides and

confirms that Cks1 is protected from exchange in the presence of Skp2/Skp1. Cks1 binding causes solvent protection at two distinct regions on Skp2 Of the 30 Skp2 peptides, seven show slowed exchange rates in the presence of Cks1 (Table 1). These seven peptides are derived from two regions in Skp2. One region is residues 377­398, corresponding to the ninth and tenth LRRs. This region has previously been identified as the binding interface for Cks1.10,13 The peptide containing the binding residue 380 (residues 377­380) showed slowed exchange rates and very low solvent accessibility in the complex (Table 1). Decreased solvent accessibility in the complex was also observed for residues 3 89 ­ 39 8 . R e s i d u e s 3 58 ­ 36 5 a nd 3 66 ­ 37 6 , corresponding to the ninth LRR, showed marginally slowed exchange rates (data not shown). The binding of Cks1 to this region of Skp2 was further confirmed using mutational analysis and ITC (Figure 8(d) and (e)). Mutation of Asp331 of Skp2 (shown previously to be a critical contacting residue10,13) to Ala abrogated the interaction with Cks1. In contrast, mutation of surface-exposed residues within the Nterminal region of Skp2 that also showed enhanced

protection in the complex, for example Thr155, did not alter the affinity for Cks1. More significant changes in exchange rates were observed for residues 149­200 of Skp2 corresponding to the F-box that binds Skp1 and the subsequent linker region. This part of the protein has not been reported previously to be involved in binding with Cks1. Very significant differences were observed in the hydrogen exchange behaviour of residues 149­167 and 168­174 upon complexation. For residues 149­167, of the deuterons involved in the amide hydrogen exchange, at least one-third have slower exchange rates in the complex (Figure 5 and Table 1). In the case of residues 168­174, in the presence of Cks1 the solvent accessibility is only about half of that in Skp2/Skp1 alone. For residues 175­181 and 175­188, the protection in the complex is not as significant as for residues 149­167 and 168­174. Most of the protected deuterons in these two peptides have intermediate exchange rates, suggesting that the protection may arise from a neighbour effect as these residues are close to tightly protected residues 149­167 and 168­174. The protection of Skp2 on binding Cks1 is shown mapped onto the structure in Figure 7(b). To confirm the differences in exchange behaviour observed for peptides from Cks1 and Skp2 described above we repeated our experiments using

protonated protein and initiating exchange in 2H2O, known as an exchange-in experiment. After the appropriate exchange reaction time, digestion was carried out using deuterated pepsin (see Materials and Methods). We reasoned that this approach would enable us to measure accurately fast exchanging sites, often susceptible to back exchange under the exchange-off conditions. We also took the added precaution of constructing a sealed electrospray source, isolated from atmospheric water and operated under dry nitrogen. In this case exchange is represented by an increase mass as deuterons are exchanged into the protonated peptides. Comparison of the mass spectra for the peptide from Skp2 (168­174) in the presence and absence of Cks1 is shown in Figure 6. A significant reduction in exchange is observed in the ternary complex compared to that observed in the absence of Cks1. This result is in very close agreement to that observed for the exchange-off experiments. Similarly, a number of other peptides that showed significant differences in exchange behaviour in our original experiments were examined under the exchange-in conditions used here (Figure 6 and Table 1). Remarkable consistency was found for the hydrogen and deuterium exchange reactions. This confirms the reproducibility of our results and strengthens our interpretation of the increased global protection of Cks1 and increased protection assigned to specific regions of Skp2. The Skp2/Skp1 complex is stabilised upon binding Cks1 The increased protection observed in the F-box of Skp2 upon binding Cks1 indicates that Cks1 binding

at the C terminus of Skp2 induces conformational changes over a distance at the N terminus. This result led us to investigate the interaction between Skp1 and Skp2 and whether it is affected by complex formation with Cks1. The rate of dissociation of the Skp2/Skp1 complex can be monitored by mixing a sample of 15N-labelled Skp2/Skp1 complex with a sample of unlabelled complex and then monitoring the mass spectrum as a function of time. We compared the rate of dissociation of the Skp2/Skp1 complex in the presence and absence of Cks1. When Skp2/Skp1 complex was incubated at 25 °C in 500 mM ammonium acetate buffer, a proportion of the complex had dissociated irreversibly after 8 h. Skp1 was observed in both monomeric and dimeric forms. The 1:2:1 distribution pattern of nitrogen isotopes for Skp1 dimers (Figure 9) indicates that the dimers are reassembled from individual 14N and 15 N-labelled Skp1. No Skp2 was observed in the spectra, presumably because the recombinant protein was unstable in the absence of Skp1 and consequently aggregated. At 32 h the Skp2/Skp1 complex had completely dissociated and no complex signal was detected in the spectrum (Figure 9). No subunit exchange of the Skp2/Skp1 complex took place within this time as no peak corresponding to (14N) Skp1/(15N)Skp2 or (15N)Skp1/(14N)Skp2 was observed in the spectra. Under the same conditions but in the presence of Cks1, there was neither subunit exchange nor any dissociation of the complex at 32 h or even after ten days of incubation. The increased resistance of the Skp2/Skp1 complex to dissociation in the presence of Cks1 suggests that Cks1 binding has a global effect on Skp2 rather than being localised to the binding site at the C terminus. This result is

consistent with the observation of increased hydrogen exchange protection at the N as well as the C terminus of the Skp2 molecule on binding Cks1.

Discussion
Cks1 is required for Skp2 to recruit some, but not all, of its substrates to the SCF complex for ubiquitination, which suggests that there is more than one mode of molecular recognition involved. Here we have used hydrogen exchange to probe the conformational and dynamic properties of Skp2 and Cks1, in order to understand how Cks1 mediates the activity of SCFSkp2. X-ray crystallography did not reveal any gross changes in the static structures of either Skp2 or Cks1 upon complex formation.7 However, we find that whilst Cks1 binds to the Cterminal region of the elongated Skp2 molecule, the interaction also causes hydrogen exchange protection at the distant N terminus of Skp2, in the region that binds Skp1 (Figure 7(b)). Further, the interaction between Skp2 and Skp1 is stabilised upon binding of Cks1. Little is known about the dynamic properties of tandem repeat protein structures such as the LRRs of Skp2,14 and the significance for function, but it is possible that the repeating nature of these structures facilitates transmission of a signal from one end of the molecule to the other, such as we observe upon binding of Cks1 to Skp2. It is also possible that the long-range effect on the Skp2/Skp1 structure of Cks1 binding is mediated by the C-terminal tail of Skp2

rather than via the LRRs, since Cks1 makes contacts with the C-terminal tail of Skp2 as well as with the Cterminal LRRs and the tail folds back all the way along the LRR domain making contacts with the Nterminal LRRs and the F-box. In particular, the strand S12 in the tail packs against strand S1 immediately preceding the LRR domain and a tightening up of this interface in the presence of Cks1 could explain the protection observed. However, since there are no significant changes apparent in the static structure of Skp2/Skp1 upon binding Cks1, we conclude that the observed long-range effects are caused by a dynamic response to binding, involving a change in flexibility and a redistribution of conformations of Skp2/Skp1 present in solution, whilst by crystallography a single conformation is frozen out. Cks1 has a highly solvent-exposed four-stranded -sheet and an -helical region; it uses each face of the -sheet to bind Cdk2 and phosphorylated p27, respectively, 9 and the -helices to bind Skp2 6 (Figure 1(b)). The hydrogen exchange results show that Skp2 binding has a delocalised effect on Cks1. They confirm that Skp2 binds to the -helical region of Cks1 but that it also results in the protection of residues distant from the binding interface, and in particular residues in the -sheet (Figure 7(a)). Since there are no significant changes in the crystal structure of Cks1 upon complexation with Skp2, the protection could instead be caused by a restriction of the flexibility of the Cks1 molecule in the bound form.

Fitting of the exchange data was carried out using the same method described for experiments in Figure 5.

spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations revealed Cks1 to have unusual conformational heterogeneity;15 specifically, the -sheet exhibits fluctuations on a microseconds­milliseconds timescale and these fluctuations are suppressed upon binding of the ligand Cdk2. The results pointed to a model that could explain the synergy observed between the binding of Cdk2 and phosphorylated ligands to Cks1: Cdk2 binding to one face of the sheet locks it in a single, relatively rigid conformation, reducing the flexibility of residues on the other face of the -sheet that comprise the binding site for phosphoprotein and thereby increasing the affinity for that ligand. The hydrogen exchange results add further detail to our understanding of the fluctuations within this small protein and their potential functional significance: NMR showed that Skp2, the ligand that binds to the -helical region of Cks1, does not alter the microseconds­ milliseconds motions of the -sheet; however, Skp2 binding does alter the slower timescale motions of the -sheet, reported by the hydrogen exchange method used here. Thus, Skp2 binding, like Cdk2 binding, by reducing the flexibility and altering the conformational ensemble of Cks1 molecules could also enhance its affinity for phosphorylated ligands. In summary, we have shown that Cks1 and Skp2 induce changes in each other upon complex formation in regions distant from the respective binding sites. The results reveal that the substrate recognition region of Skp2 (the C-terminal LRRs) is coupled to the N-terminal Skp1-binding region and thereby to the SCF catalytic core; this result adds to the model proposed previously3 that, whilst the principal func-

tion of the F-box protein is to recruit the substrate, an additional function may be in helping to position the substrate in an optimal way to the SCF catalytic core to enable the efficient transfer of ubiquitin. Further studies will be required to fully understand the dynamic nature of the SCFSkp2 complex and the mechanism of transfer of ubiquitin molecules to the substrate by this multi-subunit enzyme.

Proteins and chemicals Human Cks1 was expressed in Escherichia coli. and purified as described.16 A fragment of human Skp2 encoding the F-box and LRR domain (residues 109 to 436) was co-expressed with human Skp1 in E.coli as described.3 Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) and the correct clones were confirmed by sequencing. 14N and 15Nlabelled Skp2/Skp1 and Cks1, wild-type and mutants were expressed and purified as described.9 Pepsin and ammonium acetate were obtained from Sigma. Deuterium oxide (2H2O, >99.96%) was obtained from Aldrich and deuterated ammonium acetate (>99%) from Goss Scientific Instruments Ltd. Hydrogen exchange For the exchange-off experiments, all labile hydrogen atoms in Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 were initially replaced with deuterium atoms.17 This procedure, along with desalting, concentrating, as well as buffer exchange, was carried out using Biomax Ultrafree filters (Millipore, USA). A 5 kDa cut-off filter was used for Cks1 and a 10 kDa filter for the

Skp2/Skp1 complex. Each solution was typically washed three times (30 min for each cycle) at 4 °C with 250 mM deuterated ammonium acetate in 2H2O. Aliquots of each solution of deuterated Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 samples were then mixed to form the complex. Since the Kd value for the Cks1-Skp2/Skp1 complex is 14 nM,9 in order to ensure that Cks1 or Skp2/Skp1 were essentially 100% bound, Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 were mixed in molar ratios of 1:2 and 2:1 for measurement of hydrogen exchange of Cks1 and Skp2/ Skp1, respectively.18 These two solutions containing the complexes, along with two solutions containing Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 alone, were incubated at 4 °C overnight to allow complete deuteration and complexation. The extent of deuteration of Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 was measured by mass spectrometry (MS) from the deuterated solution using the enclosed electrospray source. Hydrogen exchange was then initiated at room temperature by 1:10 dilution with H2O or 250 mM ammonium acetate. The concentration of each protein was typically around 20 M after dilution. At various times, an aliquot of the solution was removed and the exchange quenched by addition of an acetic acid solution to reduce the pH to 2.5. The aliquot

was then rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen. All aliquots were stored at -80 °C prior to MS analysis. For the exchange-in experiments, protonated samples prepared as described above but in this case were diluted tenfold with 2H2O and the exchange was quenched by the addition of acetic-d3 acid-d (99.9% D). Mass spectrometry Mass spectra of intact proteins or complexes were recorded on a LCT mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK). Measurements of exchange-off and MS/MS of peptic peptides were carried out on a Q-TOF1 mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK). Mass spectra of fully deuterated Cks1 and Skp2/Skp1 and measurements of exchange-in of the peptic peptides were recorded on the LCT (Micromass, UK) fitted with a closed nanospray source and operated under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen to achieve minimal back exchange within the source region. Samples were introduced into the spectrometers via gold-coated nanoelectrospray (nano-ES) needles prepared in the

Figure 9. Spectra recorded for solutions containing 14N and 15Nlabelled Skp2/Skp1 at 0, 8 and 32 h after complex formation, respectively, with and without Cks1. 14N and 15N-labelled Skp2/Skp1 were mixed and incubated at room temperature for various times before nano-ES analysis. The distributions of nitrogen isotopes in the insets show that no subunit exchange occurs for Skp2/Skp1 in the presence and absence of Cks1, and Skp1 forms a dimeric complex after dissociation of Skp2/Skp1. laboratory.19 The instruments were calibrated using cesium iodide and MS/MS was carried out using argon as the collision gas. For observation of Cks1-Skp2/Skp1 complex, the LCT was operated at a capillary voltage of 1600 V and a cone voltage of 150 V. Pressures inside the spectrometer were optimised for the non-covalent complex signals, which was achieved by manually throttling the rotate pump and introducing argon gas into the hexapole region.20 For analysis of global hydrogen exchange of Cks1, each frozen aliquot was rapidly defrosted and about 2 l of the solution introduced into the LCT via a chilled nano-ES needle. Spectra were acquired at a capillary voltage of 1500 V and a cone voltage of 50 V. For localisation of hydrogen exchange of Cks1, Skp2 and Skp1, frozen aliquots were rapidly defrosted and each mixed with a 2 mg/ml pepsin/H2O solution. For exchange into 2H2O (exchange-in experiments) 2 mg/ml deuterated pepsin/2H2O solution was used to reduce back-exchange. Peptic digestion was allowed to proceed for 5 min on ice before 2 l of the solution was removed and introduced into the mass spectrometer for analysis via chilled needles. Typical instrumental settings include: mass range 200­ 2000 Da, capillary voltage 1400 V and cone voltage 20 V. Source temperature and desolvation temperature were both set at room temperature. The data acquired in the first minute were used for analysis. Data analysis The masses of intact proteins and complexes were calculated using Masslynx software (Micromass, UK). The centroid (M) of the isotope envelope of each peptic peptide was calculated manually by the following equation:21 X X M¼ ðmi Ii Þ= Ii where mi and Ii are the mass and relative abundance of the isotope peak, respectively, in an isotope envelope. Deuterons retained (D) of each peptide was calculated from the following equation: D ¼ ðM À M0 À PÞ Â B where M0 is the centroid of the unlabelled peptide, P accounts for the deuteration of side-chains and termini, and is obtained from the % of deuterium in the final solution. B is a correction factor for back exchange. For exchange measurements performed in H2O (exchangeoff), back exchange was estimated from the exchange at 0 min, i.e. exchange that was quenched immediately after it was initiated. The percentage of deuterons retained for 0 min exchange is 65(±10)%, based on the data from Cks1 and from measurement of the back exchange of the unstructured peptide Angiotensin I. Thus a value of B = 1.54 was used for exchange-off measurements. For exchange-in measurements, B = 1 was used as the back exchange is negligible with the enclosed nanoflow source developed for these experiments (see Mass spectrometry). The number of sites protected from exchange within individual peptides was plotted against exchange time and curves were fitted using the following equation: N ¼ Nfast eÀkfast t þ Nintermed eÀkintermed t þ Nslow eÀkslow t þ 0:1 Namide where N stands for the number of sites protected from hydrogen exchange at time t, Nfast, kfast, Nintermed, kintermed, Nslow and kslow for the number of sites and the rate constant for fast exchange, intermediate exchange and slow exchange, respectively, Namide represents the number of backbone amides. The term 0.1 Namide therefore accounts for the residual protection of backbone amides after complete exchange because a 1:10 dilution is used to initiate exchange in the experiments. We employed the following definitions to classify exchange rates: kfast = 30 min- 1,18 kintermed is allowed to float between 0.08 min- 1 and 1 min- 1, and kslow <0.08 min- 1. For an exchange rate of

SCFSkp2 Interaction with Cks1 0.08 min- 1,  10% of the labile sites are exchanged at 1 min and  90% at 30 min. The fitting results showed that an average value of 0.43 was obtained for Nintermed and 0.012 for Nslow. Error values were not obtained due to limited points used for fitting. Isothermal titration calorimetry Skp2/Skp1 and Cks1 samples were dialysed into 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol in the same vessel overnight at 4 °C. The samples were concentrated in VivaSpin concentrators (Vivascience) as appropriate, centrifuged at 18,000g at 4 °C for 15 min and degassed for 5­10 min. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The Skp2/Skp1 complex was applied to the reaction cell and Cks1 was applied to the syringe. ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal) at 10 °C, with a reference power of 10 cal/s and an initial delay of 200 s. The stirring speed in the reaction cell was set to 305 rpm. Titration was performed in 3 l (first injections) or 6 l aliquots at 0.5 l/s and the spacing between injections was 200 s. Heat of ligand dilution was determined in an independent control experiment by diluting Cks1 into buffer. A concentration of Cks1 of  40­50 M in the syringe and Skp2/Skp1 of  5 M was used. The data were analysed using the Origin software (Microcal).
