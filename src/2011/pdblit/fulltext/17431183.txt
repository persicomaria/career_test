Structural Insight into Pre-B Cell Receptor Function
Alexander J. Bankovich,1 Stefan Raunser,6 Z. Sean Juo,2,3,4 Thomas Walz,6 Mark M. Davis,1,2,5 K. Christopher Garcia1,2,3,4* The pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) serves as a checkpoint in B cell development. In the 2.7 angstrom structure of a human pre-BCR Fab-like fragment, consisting of an antibody heavy chain (HC) paired with the surrogate light chain, the "unique regions" of VpreB and l5 replace the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) loop of an antibody light chain and appear to "probe" the HC CDR3, potentially influencing the selection of the antibody repertoire. Biochemical analysis indicates that the pre-BCR is impaired in its ability to recognize antigen, which, together with electron microscopic visualization of a pre-BCR dimer, suggests ligand-independent oligomerization as the likely signaling mechanism. cells traverse regulatory checkpoints to ensure that their surface-expressed antigen-specific B cell receptor (BCR) is functional yet not autoreactive (1). Upon antigen recognition by the BCR, a B cell becomes activated, expands clonally, and advances to the plasma cell stage, where it secretes soluble antibody. Before antibody genes can be transcribed, each B cell must productively rearrange one HC and one light chain (LC) gene (2). After HC expression but before the LC is rearranged to form the mature BCR, the pre-BCR is expressed (3, 4). In a functional pre-BCR, two invariant proteins, l5 and VpreB, form a heterodimer called the surrogate light chain (SLC) that pairs with a rearranged HC (5­10). Not all rearranged HCs can pair with the SLC to form a pre-BCR (11), but the structural basis of selection and pairing is unknown. In mice, only half of the in-frame rearranged HCs pair correctly with SLCs (11). Only those B cells that express an HC capable of pairing with the SLC undergo clonal expansion (12­15), which enriches for HCs that are capable of BCR formation (16). Humans that lack l5 have a major block in B cell development, decreasing peripheral B cell numbers by more than 99% (17). l5-deficient mice have a less severe phenotype, but B cell development remains substantially delayed (18). The overall architecture of the pre-BCR is shown in Fig. 1A. The SLC/HC pair presumably contains a similar architecture of immunoglobulin (Ig)­like domains as a Fab, but the nonpolymorphic VpreB and l5 are predicted to have divergent b-strand topologies in comparison

to canonical Ig-domain sequences (6). The N terminus of l5 and the C terminus of VpreB have "unique regions" that share no sequence similarity to known proteins nor have a counterpart in other Ig receptors. Yet, functional studies implicate these unique regions as being essential to pre-BCR function (19­21). Both the pre-BCR and BCR signal through interaction with a heterodimeric signaling complex, Iga/Igb, which has intracellular segments containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) that interact with downstream adaptor and effector molecules (22). In the mature BCR, antigen engagement leads to receptor clustering and activation. However, it remains unclear whether pre-BCR signaling during normal B cell development is ligand dependent. On the one hand, several putative extracellular ligands have been identified, such as galectin-1 in humans (20) and heparin sulfate in mice (19). On the other hand, unique region­dependent, homotypic preBCR aggregation alone is capable of initiating downstream signaling events (21). To gain structural insights into pre-BCR biology, we expressed and crystallized a soluble form of the human pre-BCR analogous to the Fab of an antibody (dashed box in Fig. 1A). This "Fab-like" pre-BCR was secreted from baculovirus-infected insect cells by triple coinfection of recombinant viruses encoding an ovalbumin (OVA)­specific human HC [variable region of Ig HC (VH) and domain 1 of the constant portion of the Ig HC (CH1)], l5, and VpreB. We crystallized a monomeric form of the pre-BCR with the l5 N terminus truncated by 36 residues and determined the structure to 2.7 Å (the complex with intact l5 forms a dimer that will be discussed later). The pre-BCR adopts an overall quaternary structure that is reminiscent of a Fab. The SLC heterodimer proteins VpreB and l5 replace the Ig LC variable and constant regions (VL and CL) of a Fab, respectively (Fig. 1B). The VpreB domain forms a canonical V-type Ig fold that includes b strands a to f (23). However, the VpreB polypeptide g strand is replaced by a portion of the N-terminal unique region of l5 that completes the bottom b sheet of the V-type

Ig fold (Fig. 1C). In this arrangement, the l5 unique region substitutes for the J region of a normal VL that follows LC CDR3 (CDR3-L) and is involved in the VH/VL interface. This strand swap, which was previously predicted from homology modeling (5, 24), has no counterpart in Ig domains characterized to date. In accord with the obligate nature of SLC heterodimer formation (7), the interface between VpreB and the l5 b strand is extensive, burying ~1000 Å2 of surface area and forming 16 hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1D). The l5 b strand exits from the base of VpreB and enters the l5 constant domain. The l5 structure is similar to a Fab CL domain (82% identity and 1.4 Å root mean square deviation). The region of the pre-BCR that is analogous to the antigen-binding site of antibodies contains surface-exposed loops similar to the CDR1-L and CDR2-L of a VL (fig. S1). However, as their sequence divergence from antibodies would predict, neither loop adopts any of the known canonical LC CDR structures (25). In the pre-BCR structure, the CDR3-L of a VL is replaced by two unconnected, frayed polypeptide chains comprising the unique regions of l5 and VpreB (Figs. 1C and 2B and fig. S2). The proteolytic sensitivity of a portion of the l5 unique region, which is N-terminal to the swapped b strand, suggests that this segment of the molecule is highly accessible and flexible (Fig. 1B). However, we were able to identify 11 ordered amino acids of the C-terminal unique region of VpreB in the electron density maps. This chain protrudes from the antigen-binding site, extends over the top of HC CDR3 (CDR3-H), and obscures the antigen-combining region of the HC (Fig. 2, A and B). The extended VpreB unique region structure is stabilized by a salt bridge between VpreB residue Glu106 and HC residue Arg59 (asterisk in Fig. 2B), although, as a result of the surface exposure, it may assume alternative conformations when complexed with different HCs [the B factors for this segment are not higher than those of the rest of the structure (table S2)]. We compared the mode of interaction between HC and SLC in the pre-BCR to that between HC and LC of all (seven) antibodies in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (Fig. 2C, fig. S2, and table S1) that contain the same number of residues (12) in their CDR3-H as does the HC in our pre-BCR structure. The pre-BCR exhibits a decrease of ~30% in the number of variable domain interface contacts (hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions) in comparison to this panel of Fabs (e.g., 53 versus 80 contacts for 1Q0X) and yet buries more surface area than most VH/VL pairs (915 Å2 versus an average of 825 Å2) (table S1). This result is due to a net loss of interactions between the SLC and HC framework residues, but there is a gain in the extent of the overall SLC/HC interface due to the SLC unique regions blanketing the HC CDR3-H (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the SLC unique regions probing CDR3-H sequences, we found more contacts (11) between the SLC unique region res-

REPORTS
idues and CDR3-H than between CDR3-H and CDR3-L in representative Fab structures (an average of four) (table S1). The CDR3-H loop is extended in the preBCR, allowing it to simultaneously interact with SLC CDR2, the unique regions of VpreB and l5, and other HC framework residues (Fig. 2, B to D). In contrast, in a Fab, the CDR3-H generally makes contact with only a small portion of the VL CDR1 and CDR2 loops (fig. S3, A and B). The expansive CDR3-H interactions in the pre-BCR are enabled, by fewer structural constraints imposed on the extended and apparently flexible unique regions of VpreB and l5 (Fig. 2, B and
124 112

C, and fig. S2B), as compared to the more constrained closed-loop structure of a Fab CDR3-L. Such structural plasticity could permit unique regions to adapt to diverse CDR3-H sequences and loop lengths. The pre-BCR appears to influence the VH repertoire (i.e., CDR3-H sequences) of HCs in

the mature B cell population (11). We crystallized a human pre-BCR, but the majority of genetic data on HC repertoire selection is derived from murine studies. Comparison of the HC repertoires selected by mouse and human cells reveals that murine CDR3-H sequences contain a significantly higher frequency of tyrosines and are, on average, two amino acids shorter than the human CDR3-H (26). The mouse and human VpreB proteins are 73% identical, and the l5 b-strand insertion is 75% identical. Also, mice have two VpreB proteins (VpreB1 and VpreB2) that are 97% identical, differing at positions 9, 75, and 103 for VpreB1 (Leu9, Thr75, Gln103) and VpreB2 (Ser9, Asn75, His103) from human VpreB (Leu9, Thr75, Ser103). In our pre-BCR structure, positions 9 and 75 are distal to the interface with HC and are therefore unlikely to mediate pre-BCR assembly. The remaining residue, Ser103, is located directly above the CDR3-H residue (Tyr104) (Fig. 2D) and is therefore close enough to play a structural role in engaging and influencing CDR3-H sequence composition. Two pre-BCR residues make extensive contact with CDR3-H in our structure: Ser59 in VpreB and His59 in l5 (Fig. 2D). VpreB Ser59 interacts with the first two residues of CDR3-H (Tyr100 and Tyr101), whereas l5 His59 is positioned at the C terminus of CDR3-H, and so together they bracket the CDR3-H. Along with the Ser103 position, these residues may demarcate the boundary of a "CDR3-H sensing site" for HC repertoire selection (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, in tandem with the many complex biological mechanisms that regulate B cell development, we suggest that the SLC unique region residues in proximity to CDR3-H may play a role in influencing the observed sequence differences between the CDR3-H repertoires in mice and humans. The CDR3-H of germline HC is the focal point for sequence diversity, with the rest of the HC and SLC being nonpolymorphic, including interfacial residues between the SLC and the HC. Thus, the site of HC discrimination is likely localized to the CDR3-H. To address whether the pre-BCR is capable of recognizing antigen, we engineered a pre-BCR by pairing the SLC with an HC of defined antigen specificity. We used OVA-specific germline HCs from genetically limited mice (IgH-/- and Igk -/-) containing one transgenic human HC locus and the mouse l LC locus (27). The antibodies produced by these mice in response to primary immunization achieve antigen specificity exclusively through different CDR3-H sequences, showing that antigen recognition can be accomplished by diversity in only one of the six CDR loops. For pre-BCR binding experiments, we chose a panel of four OVAspecific HCs from these mice and paired them with an invariant l1 LC or SLC to produce Fab and pre-BCR, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). These nonsomatically mutated Fabs recognize OVA with an affinity ranging from 9 to 40 mM by means of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), whereas a hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL)­ specific Fab exhibited no detectable binding (Fig. 3, B and C). For pre-BCR complexes of the same HCs and SLC, the highest affinity observed was 400 mM, essentially at the limit of detection for SPR (Fig. 3, A and C). To test the effect of LC diversity, we paired the OVA5 HC with an LC containing a point mutation in CDR3-L and found that the Fab retained binding, confirming the primacy of the CDR3-H in

antigen recognition (fig. S4) (28). These results suggest that the pre-BCR cannot recognize protein antigens in a physiologically meaningful way, but we cannot rule out this possibility for highly abundant antigens or for small molecules. The decrease in antigen binding of the preBCR is consistent with the structure of the VpreB C-terminal unique region, which extends over the antigen-combining site and could partially block antigen binding (fig. S5). Because antigen engagement does not appear to play a role in pre-BCR signaling, we revisited the concept of pre-BCR oligomerization with our recombinant pre-BCR Fab-like fragment. Size exclusion chromatography of the soluble preBCR yielded two peaks (Fig. 4A) with HC, l5, and VpreB in a 1:1:1 stoichiometric ratio, which elute at the positions for a dimer and a monomer, respectively. In the monomer peak, the l5 unique region was proteolytically truncated (Fig. 4A). Subsequent recombinant truncation of l5 and VpreB unique regions resulted solely in monomer formation (fig. S6, A and B). Thus, perturbation of the unique regions disrupts dimerization. These data likely explain why a previously reported recombinant form of a pre-BCR Fab-like fragment, in which the VpreB and l5 were synthetically fused to create a "single-chain" SLC, was a monomer by gel filtration. The ability of the purified recombinant pre-BCR to dimerize indicates that accessory protein(s) are not required for dimerization, and, by extension, pre-BCR signaling through multimerization can occur in a ligandindependent fashion. Although we were unable to crystallize the dimeric form of the pre-BCR, we undertook electron microscopic (EM) studies of the pre-BCR dimer in negative stain to visualize the oligomeric architecture (Fig. 4C and figs. S7 and S8). A conservative and unbiased analysis of

both raw grids and several class averages reveals the pre-BCR dimers (Fig. 4C and figs. S7 and S8), consisting of two pre-BCR monomers (Fab-like modules) connected by a flexible hinge between the tips of the variable domains. The pre-BCR "Fab arms" in each dimer appear constrained to lying on their side, so that we observe a side-on perspective of the interdimer angle (Fig. 4C). The angle between the two pre-BCR molecules ranged from 5° to 60°, suggesting a high level of flexibility at the interface between the two domains. For each pre-BCR dimer class average, we generated a schematic model using the pre-BCR monomer crystal structure (bottom panels in Fig. 4C). We then used the l5 truncation data, EM results, and the crystal structure to model the pre-BCR signaling complex on the cell surface (Fig. 4D). In this model, each Fab-like arm of the intact pre-BCR on the cell surface dimerizes with that of a different pre-BCR, resulting in an extended chain of self-associated pre-BCRs on the cell surface that could signal through the close proximity of their intracellular domains (Fig. 4D).
