Abstract

Ferredoxins (Fd) are electron-carrier proteins, the active sites of which are organized around clusters made of iron and inorganic sulfur. The Fd from Clostridium acidurici is 55 amino acids long and contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters. Crystals have been obtained in the space group P43212, a = b = 3 4 . 4 4 1 (5), c = 74.778 (9) A. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the Fd from Peptostreptcoccus asaccharolyticus as a search model, these two ferredoxins having 37 residues in common. Refinement using molecular-dynamics techniques was then initiated. Successive rounds of model building and refinement gave a structure that includes 45 water molecules with R = 15%. At this stage, the electron-density map clearly revealed discrepancies in the position of two amino acids in the published primary sequence. Refinement based on these modifications led to R = 14.3% for 3921 reflections up to 1.8 ~, resolution. The geometry of the two clusters has been found to be in good agreement with that previously obtained at a lower resolution. Interactions of polypeptide chain with the [4Fe-4S] clusters, the cluster geometry as well as the hydrogen bonds involving S, SF, N and water molecules are reported.
Introduction

specificity. Among the 214Fe-4S] ferredoxins, only the crystal structure of the ferredoxin from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (P. asaccharolyticus) has been determined with a resolution of 2 A (Adman, Sieker & Jenson, 1973). Recently, the crystal structure of Clostridium acidurici (C. acidurici), has been determined at a resolution of 5 ,~,. We report here the current structural model of this ferredoxin at 1.8 A resolution.
Materials and methods

(a) X-ray diffraction data
Precession photos of crystals provided by L. C. Sieker show the same space group and unit-cell parameters as those previously reported (Murthy, Hendrickson, OrmeJohnson, Merritt & Phizackerley, 1988). Diffraction data were obtained from measurements at room temperature on a FAST diffractometer equipped with an area detector. Graphite-monochromatized Cu Ka radiation was used. Unit-cell dimensions are a = b = 34.441 (5), c = 74.778 (9) ,~,. Systematic extinctions confirm the tetragonal space group P43212 or P41212 (the former was later shown to be correct). 4500 unique reflections up to 1.8 ~, were obtained and 3921 of them had Fo > 20 (MADNES, Pflugrath & Messerschmidt, 1988; Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).

(b) Structure determination and refinement
The structure of C. acidurici ferredoxin was solved by the molecular-replacement (MR) method (MERLOT/ CCP4, Fitzgerald, 1988). Atomic coordinates used were from P. asaccharolyticus. The R factor of the model obtained by MR was 32% for all reflections in the data shell 5-3 A. Initially, slow-cooling refinement (X-PLOR, Brtinger, 1990) using the standard force-field constants tended to distort the F e - - S distances and S - - F e - - S angles leading to an unrealistic [4Fe-4S] cluster geometry; as a result this convergence was stopped at a rather high R factor of 27%. In order to prevent over-distortion of the iron-sulfur cluster geometry, a new series of refinements using the

Iron-sulfur clusters of the [4Fe-4S] cubane type are found in many proteins and they are involved in the catalysis of a variety of reactions, including redox reactions (Beinert, 1990). This functional diversity of the [4Fe-4S] clusters in proteins suggests that the polypeptide chains play an important role in fine tuning the catalytic properties of these enzymes. Clostridial ferredoxins are known, by their redox activities, to interact with several well characterized partners (Mortenson & Nachos, 1973), such as hydrogenase, certain nitrogenases (such as Clostridium pasteurianum), and pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The molecular details of these interactions are still unknown, but probably depend on some structural

modified force constants were performed (TranQui et al., 1995). These later refinements led to a reasonable model and decreased the R factor down to 23%. At this point the model obtained generate(J, only two short intermolecular contacts of about 2.2 A solely involving side-chain atoms. It appeared that both short contacts were due to differences in the amino-acid sequences of P. asaccharolyticus and C. acidurici. Further refinements alternated with difference Fourier maps and graphic aided readjustments (TOM, Cambillau, 1989) have slowly reduced the R factor to 15% for 3921 reflections up to 1.8 A. A close inspection of the shape of the electron density (Fig. 1) around the side chain of the Aspl5 residue suggested that the 15th residue in the C. acidurici sequence was glutamic rather than aspartic acid. Replacements of Asp l5 by Glul5 in the structural model, followed by 12 refinement cycles, reduced the R factor to 14.5%. This sequence modification was later confirmed by a resequencing experiment. Furthermore, the resequencing suggested the following additional changes: Asp21-,Asn21, Gly25~Ser25, Gly27-, Asp27 and Ser28-,Asp28. Model rebuilding based on the new sequence and subsequent refinement, however, indicated that the amino-acid sequence around this region is still crystallographically uncertain. After introduction of 45 water molecules and replacement of Asp 15 by Glu 15, a new difference Fourier map showed electron

density around the (res25-res26-res27-res28) region at the 1.2or contour level allowing the localization of the (res25-res26-res27-res28) loop. The electron-density shape for the (res25-res26-res27-res28) region was, however, still broad even after subsequent refinements, compared to other regions of the molecule. Finally, refinements including both [4Fe-4S] clusters, 447 protein atoms and 45 water molecules reduced the R factor to 14.3% for reflections in the range of 5-1.3 ,~, (15.7% for all reflections) and led to a model with reasonable tp and @ angles (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) (Fig. 2). The norms and r.m.s, values of temperature factors for cluster atoms, main chain, side chains and water molcules are (7.11, 0.88 ,~2), (11.3, 4.5 ,~2), (17.4, 9.0 ,~2), and (30.3, 11.9 ~2), respectively.* The r.m.s, deviations from the ideal bond lengths for main chain, side chains, clusters and water molecules are 0.012, 0.012, 0.017 and 0.023 ,~,, respectively.
Results and discussion

As expected, the general folding, [4Fe-4S]-cluster positions and arrangements of both C. acidurici and P. asaccharolyticus exhibit similar features: (a) [4Fe-4S]

D. TRANQUI AND J. C. JI~SIOR clusters are separated by 12.0 ,~ and are buried inside the polypeptide chain conferring to the C. acidurici molecule an ellipsoid shape with an approximate dimension of 26 x 26 x 28 A; (b) the coordination of cysteine is preserved; (c) hydrophobic residues tend to pack around the iron-sulfur cluster in such a way that almost all of the [4Fe-4S] faces are screened from direct interaction with solvent molecules by proper orientations of the surrounding hydrophobic side chains. Thus, it is observed that the spatial arrangements of tyrosine rings

(Tyr2 and Tyr29 for clusters I and II, respectively) tend to prevent direct contact between cluster and solvent. A similar arrangement has been found in P. asaccharolyticus (Adman, Watenpaugh & Jensen, 1975).

(a) Geometry and environment of [4Fe-4S] clusters
The geometry of the iron-sulfur cluster is cubane-like; each Fe atom is linked to three S atoms and each S atom has three Fe atoms as immediate neishbours (Fig. 3). The average F e - - S bond length, 2.31 A, in both [4Fe-4S] clusters is of the same order as that observed in P. asaccharolyticus (2.31 A). As in the P. asaccharolyticus protein, each of the two [4Fe--4S] clusters in C. acidurici are attached to the protein chain by four covalent F e - - S r bonds at Cys8, Cysll, Cysl4, Cys47 for cluster I and Cysl8, Cys37, Cys40, Cys43 for cluster II. The Fe--S~, bond lengths ranging from 2.28 to 2.34 ,~, suggest that they are covalent-preponderant in character. In addition to the links of each [4Fe-4S] to the polypeptide chain by the four Fe-S~, bonds, N--H...S hydrogen bonds enhance the stability of the [4Fe-4S] positions relative to their immediate hydrophobic neighbours by anchoring the amide groups in the vicinity of the inorganic cluster. The hydrogen-bond network involving the cluster and nearby amide groups in C. acidurici and in P. asaccharolyticus are compared

in Table 1. Again, the immediate environment of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is preserved in C. acidurici and in P. asaccharolyticus (Adman, Watenpaugh & Jensen, 1975). Moreover, it is worth noting that the tyrosine rings (Tyr2 and Tyr29 for cluster I and II, respectively) protect clusters from direct contact with solvent molecules; these interactions are similar in C. acidurici and the [4Fe-4S] P. asaccharolyticus species (Fig. 4).

As mentioned above, the conformation of the polypeptide chain in C. acidurici is mainly governed by the bonding requirements involved in joining eight cysteine groups with two [4Fe-4S] clusters through Fe--S× covalent bonds. Therefore, it is to be expected that the organization of the polypeptide chain around the [Fem4S] cluster will remain similar in P. asaccharolyticus and in C. acidurici. To some extent, this similarity spreads over the whole molecule with only one exception for the inserted region defined by the (res25-res26-res27-res28) loop. The relatively high atomic thermal factors associated with this region (characterized by rather ill def'med electron density) suggest that the (res25-res26-res27-res28) segment is subjected to static and/or dynamic conformational disorder. This assumption is supported by the fact that this region, located on the surface of the protein, far from the [4Fe-4S] centers, may by exposed to solvent interactions. Furthermore, this loop is also located in the longest stretch of chain that contains no strict homology to any of the other ferredoxins, implying that it has sufficient flexibility to accommodate amino-acid changes without affecting the integrity of the molcule. Similar disorder has been recently observed in the one-[4Fe--4S] cluster ferredoxins of B. thermoproteolyticus (residues 28-30); this area in the crystal structure has large temperature factors and the weakest electron density (Fukuyama, Matsubara, Tsukihara & Katsube, 1989). It is not unreasonable to expect that a similar phenomenon occurs in C. acidurici. The atomic coordinates in this disordered region are very approximate.

Fig. 5. Water molecules are mostly distributed outside and near the surface of the protein molecule. Some water molecules, however, are deeply buried inside the molecule and serve to establish strong hydrogen bonds between adjacent peptide chains. Localized water molecules seem to play two different roles: (a) those near the surface are hydrogen bonded preferentially to polar groups on the protein, and (b) those that establish contacts between two symmetrically related molecules. Concluding remarks The high-resolution data (1.8 .A) used to determine and to refine the C. acidurici structure give, in addition to the confh'mation of the similarity between the P. asaccharolyticus and C. acidurici species, (a) a better definition of the positions of the Ca chain and associated side chains, (b) a correction of the sequence error and (c) the localization of the inserted region (residues 25-28). They also give a more accurate description of the [4Fe--4S] cluster geometry, information that is essential for an understanding of the redox activity in this class of proteins.*

Structural data at low temperatures and inelastic neutron-scattering spectroscopy would be useful to separate the dynamic and static contributions, hence providing more insight on the temperature dependence of dynamics in C. acidurici.

(c) Water molecules, hydrogen bonds and crystal packing
45 water molecules have been unambiguously localized by difference-Fourier peaks. Others, corresponding to ill defined electron density, may be ascribed to more loosely linked waters. They are not included in Table 2, even though their contribution, mediated by hydrogen bonds, as a packing force may be crucial for crystal cohesion. No evidence of other solvent species (e.g. ammonium sulfate which was used in crystal growth) has been found. The distribution of water molecules around the ferredoxin molecule is shown in
