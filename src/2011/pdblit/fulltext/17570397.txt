ABSTRACT Based on new Rhodopseudomonas (Rp.) viridis reaction center (RC) coordinates with a reliable structure of the secondary acceptor quinone (QB) site, a continuum dielectric model and finite difference technique have been used to identify clusters of electrostatically interacting ionizable residues. Twenty-three residues within a distance of 25 A from QB (QB cluster) have been shown to be strongly electrostatically coupled to QB, either directly or indirectly. An analogous cluster of 24 residues is found to interact with QA (QA cluster). Both clusters extend to the cytoplasmic surface in at least two directions. However, the QB cluster differs from the QA cluster in that it has a surplus of acidic residues, more strong electrostatic interactions, is less solvated, and experiences a strong positive electrostatic field arising from the polypeptide backbone. Consequently, upon reduction of QA or QB, it is the QB cluster, and not the QA cluster, which is responsible for substoichiometric proton uptake at neutral pH. The bulk of the changes in the QB cluster are calculated to be due to the protonation of a tightly coupled cluster of the three Glu residues (L212, H1 77, and M234) within the QB cluster. If the lifetime of the doubly reduced state QB2- is long enough, Asp M43 and Ser L223 are predicted to also become protonated. The calculated complex titration behavior of the strongly interacting residues of the QB cluster and the resulting electrostatic response to electron transfer may be a common feature in proton-transferring membrane protein complexes.

INTRODUCTION A fundamental principle in bioenergetics is the coupling of
electron transfers to the translocation of protons through proteins embedded in the energy-transducing cellular membranes. In bacterial photosynthesis, proton uptake from the cytoplasm is coupled to light-induced electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs). The RCs from purple bacteria are the best-characterized membrane proteins. The crystal structure of the RC from the nonsulfur purple bacterium Rhodopseudomonas (Rp.) viridis was the first integral membrane protein structure to be determined at atomic resolution (Deisenhofer et al., 1985; Deisenhofer and Michel, 1989). It is composed of four polypeptides (the L, M, and H subunits and a tightly bound cytochrome c) and 14 cofactors (four hemes, four bacteriochlorophyll-b, two bacteriopheophytin-b, one nonheme iron, two quinones, and one carotenoid). The complex has 11 membrane-spanning helices: five in the L, five in the M, and one in the H subunit. Large parts of the L and M subunits and their associated cofactors are related by a twofold symmetry axis perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. This membrane protein complex plays a central role in the conversion of light energy into chemical energy (Nicholls and Ferguson, 1992). The absorption of a photon by a dimer of bacteriochlorophyll, the so-called special pair D (we use the nomenclature proposed by Hoff, 1988) leads to a charge

separation between D and the menaquinone, QA, bound to the M subunit (reviewed by Kirmaier and Holten, 1993; Zinth and Kaiser, 1993). The electron is then transferred from QAto a secondary quinone, QB, bound to the L subunit (reviewed by Parson, 1978; Shinkarev and Wraight, 1993). After a second reduction of QB and the uptake of two protons from the cytoplasm, the ubiquinol (QBH2) leaves its binding site (Crofts and Wraight, 1983; McPherson et al., 1990) and is reoxidized by a second membrane protein complex, the cytochrome bc, complex (cf. Knaff, 1993, for a review), which results in the release of protons on the periplasmic side of the membrane. This proton transport produces a transmembrane electrochemical gradient that drives ATP synthesis through a third membrane-spanning complex, the ATP synthase (Mitchell, 1979). In summary, the reduction of bound QB to the quinol associated with the uptake of protons into the RC is an important step in the energetics of photosynthetic bacteria (Cramer and Knaff, 1991). The sequence of light-induced electron and proton transfer reactions that occur within the RC in the process of reducing QB to QBH2 has been represented by a quinone reduction cycle (Okamura and Feher, 1992; Fig. 1). The cycle starts with the RC in the initial state DQAQB. Light absorption leads to an excited primary donor D*, from which an electron is transferred via the monomeric bacteriochlorophyll BA and the bacteriopheophytin 4A to QA in 200 ps (Parson and Ke, 1982; Holzapfel et al., 1989), leading to the formation of D+QA-QB. Re-reduction of D+ by cytochrome c5585 (heme 3; Fritzsch et al., 1989) occurs in 320 ns (Dracheva et al., 1988). These processes are much faster than the subsequent proton uptake and inter-quinone electron transfer reactions. Therefore, the first step of quinone reduction in Rp. viridis RCs can be viewed as a photochemical cytochrome oxidation, giving rise to the radical state DQA-QB. The second step involves the transfer of this first electron to QB (in 17-25 ,s; Carithers and

Parson, 1975; Leibl and Breton, 1991; Mathis et al., 1992), resulting in the state DQAQB-. After a second photochemical cytochrome oxidation in the third step, the diradical state DQA-QB- is formed. The fourth step results in the singly protonated, doubly reduced state DQA(QBH)- and could proceed through two possible paths. Either proton uptake could be followed by transfer of the second electron, involving an intermediate state DQA-(QBH), or electron transfer could lead to the intermediate state DQAQB2- and then be followed by proton transfer. Deduction of free energy changes associated with the formation of QBH2 in native and Glu L212 -> Gln mutant RCs from Rb. sphaeroides favored the intermediate state DQAQB2- (McPherson et al., 1994). However, this is clearly not an equilibrium state, because QB2- will be rapidly doubly protonated. Nevertheless, this redox state was included in the present analysis, first because it is a possible intermediate and second because sites that are calculated to bind protons in the presence of QB2- may be good candidates for sites that can be transiently protonated and serve as proton donors to QB- in the QA-QB- state. The transfer of the second proton to QBH- (step 5 in Fig. 1) is kinetically indistinguishable from the first proton transfer in the wild-type RC and can only be resolved in the case of mutants with significantly retarded second proton transfer rates (McPherson et al.,

FIGURE 1 Quinone reduction cycle (modified from Okamura and Feher, 1992). Reduced quinones are typeset in bold. Steps 2, 4, 5, and 6 are reversible. Bold frames highlight the five redox states studied in the present work. See text for details.

1994). Both QA and QB sites are deeply buried within the reaction center complex, approximately 15 A from the cytoplasmic surface. After the initial reduction Of QA and QB, protons are bound to protonatable residues within the protein. In addition, after the second reduction of QB, the release of the product quinol requires proton transfer to the reduced quinone within the QB-binding site. This could occur by protons moving along a chain of proton donors and acceptors by a "proton wire" or hydrogen-bonded chain mechanism (Nagle and Tristam-Nagle, 1983). Possible proton donors and acceptors are protonatable amino acid residues and water molecules. The challenge is to assign the changes in protonation of the protein to specific residues. A number of the protonatable residues between the QB site and the cytoplasmic surface have been shown to be functionally relevant for the proton transfer process by analysis of sitedirected mutations (reviewed by Okamura and Feher, 1992, 1995; Takahashi and Wraight, 1994) and second site revertants (Hanson et al., 1993; reviewed by Sebban et al., 1995a). The observed effects can be due to modification of the kinetics or thermodynamics of electron or proton transfer. Identification of residues that contribute to the changes in equilibrium distributions of protons in the different redox states of the protein should help to determine the role of the functionally important residues. Recent advances in structure-based electrostatic calculations (reviewed by Honig and Nicholls, 1995; cf. also Warwicker and Watson, 1982; Warshel and Russel, 1984; Harvey, 1989; Sharp and Honig, 1990) on the RCs of Rb. sphaeroides (Beroza et al., 1991; Gunner and Honig, 1992; Beroza et al., 1995) and Rp. viridis (Cometta-Morini et al.,

1993) have demonstrated the ability of this method to provide insight into the coupling of proton transfer to electron transfer. These studies were restricted to the "neutral" RC, i.e., the ground-state DQAQB, and to the redox state after the transfer of the first electron to QA or QB. Furthermore, these calculations were based on structures with QB sites that were either weakly defined (as was the case for the Rp. viridis RC) or that display significant discrepancies in the QB site of independently determined structures (as is the case for the Rb. sphaeroides RC structures; Lancaster et al., 1995). A more reliable QB site structure has been obtained from x-ray crystallographic analysis of crystals that have full occupancy of ubiquinone-2 in the QB site of the Rp. viridis RC (Lancaster and Michel, manuscript in preparation; Lancaster and Michel, 1996). Based on this new structure, we have used a continuum dielectric model and finite difference technique to identify clusters of electrostatically interacting ionizable residues and calculate the average protonation of ionizable residues in the five redox states: the

MATERIALS AND METHODS Coordinates
The nonhydrogen atom coordinates of the Rp. viridis reaction center structure based on QB reconstitution with ubiquinone-2 (Lancaster and Michel, manuscript in preparation) were used in the calculations. Protons were added with the programs HPP and PROTEUS (A. Joguine and M. R. Gunner, City College of New York, unpublished). HPP adds those protons that are uniquely determined by heavy atom positions. PROTEUS orients the positions of protons on water molecules and hydroxyl groups to minimize the electrostatic interaction free energy of the proton with residues within 4.5 A of the hydroxyl or water oxygen. Sulfate, detergent, and water molecules were removed from the structure. The carboxy-terminal four residues of the C subunit (Ala-Ala-Ala-Lys) are disordered in the crystal structure and are not included in these calculations. The isoprenoid tail of the ubiquinone-2 molecule was modified by applying the twofold symmetry operator between L and M subunits (Deisenhofer et al., 1995) to the tail of QA. Subsequent minimization of only the isoprenoid tail yielded a ubiquinone-7 model (UQ7) with headgroup coordinates identical to those determined for ubiquinone-2.

Calculation of electrostatic energies
The analysis presented here assumes that the difference between the free energies of ionization of side chains in solution and within the protein is due solely to electrostatic free energy terms. For the calculation of electrostatic energies, several simplifying assumptions are made about the structure of the protein in different ionization states (Yang et al., 1993; Beroza et al., 1995). Thus, the x-ray structure is used for all protonation and redox states of the protein without modification of either heavy atom or nondissociatable proton positions. The effect of motions of the protein and solvent on changes in charge state is approximated by the response of a dielectric continuum. The program DelPhi (Gilson et al., 1987; Sharp and Honig, 1990; Nicholls and Honig, 1991) was used to solve the Poisson equation to obtain the electrostatic potential in and around the RC, given a distribution of charges within the dielectric boundary of the protein (Gunner and Honig, 1991). A dielectric constant of 4 was assigned to the protein interior and 80

was used for water (Gilson and Honig, 1986). The use of a protein dielectric constant of 4 assumes that charges not only polarize electrons in the protein (E = 2) but also cause some rearrangement of protein dipoles (Gilson and Honig, 1986). A dielectric constant of 4 has been used previously in the work of Beroza et al. (1995) and Gunner and Honig (1991, 1992). Gunner and Honig (1991) found that the calculation of electrochemical midpoint potentials of the four cytochrome hemes in the C subunit of Rp. viridis provided closer correspondence with the experimental data when E = 4 than with E = 2 or E = 6. Similar results were obtained by Beroza (1993). Antosiewicz et al. (1994) have suggested that E values as large as 20 improve the overall agreement with the experimental data for small soluble proteins such as lysozyme. The use of E = 4 in this work is consistent with, and therefore allows comparison to, earlier calculations on RCs. A probe sphere radius (Richards, 1977; Connolly, 1983) of 1.4 A was used to define the dielectric boundary between solvent and solute. The atomic van der Waals radii used were taken from Yang et al. (1993). No membrane was included in the calculations. Recent electrostatic calculations on the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin with (Bashford and Gerwert, 1992) and without (Sampogna and Honig, 1994) a membrane model yielded basically the same results, so that the omission of a model membrane in this study is not likely to affect the general results. In addition, as will be discussed below, almost all of the residues of interest are located outside of the membrane in the cytoplasmic region of the protein complex. The charge distributions on the amino acid side chains were taken from the CHARMM charge set (Brooks et al., 1983) as described by Gunner and Honig (1992). The charge distribution of the cofactors was adapted from Treutlein et al. (1992, cf. Table 1). The neutral quinone has a charge of +0.5 on the carbonyl carbon atoms and -0.5 on the carbonyl oxygen atoms. For the singly reduced quinone these values were 0.0 and -0.5; for the doubly reduced quinone they were 0.0 and -1.0, respectively (cf. Table 1). Neither QA nor QB was considered protonatable. Because the (singly reduced) unprotonated semiquinone QA- or QB- is stable and unprotonated over a wide pH range (Wraight, 1982), protonation of the quinone is only relevant for the transfer of the second electron to QB. The residues Arg, Asp, Cys, Glu, His, Lys, Tyr, the heme propionates, the chain termini, and the cofactors were treated as ionizable residues. All other residues were assumed to have no net charge. The histidine ligands of the nonheme iron, the bacteriochlorophylls, and the hemes (13 of the 29 His residues) were also assumed to remain neutral, as were the eight Cys residues involved in thioether bonds to the cytochrome heme groups; the N-terminal Cys of the C subunit, which is covalently bound via a thioether bond to a diacylglycerol (Weyer et al., 1987); and Cys L122, which is membrane-exposed and located in the middle part of transmembrane helix C (Deisenhofer and Michel, 1989). Ser L223 has been proposed to form a transiently protonated state, Ser L223-OH2', which could serve as a proton donor to the doubly reduced QB (Okamura and Feher, 1992). Ser L223 was therefore considered to be protonatable, with an estimated pKs., of -1.7 (ComettaMorini et al., 1993), in a separate series of calculations. Water molecules are not explicitly included in the calculations. The screening of charges by the external, solvent water is accounted for by the external dielectric constant of 80. Crystallographic, buried water molecules behave more like dipolar protein side chains than like a dielectric continuum. However, explicit inclusion of buried water molecules is difficult, because the water hydrogen atom positions are not unique. Protonation and deprotonation of neighboring amino acids will change the orientation of the water hydrogen atoms to stabilize both protonation states of a residue (Yang et al., 1993). Calculations that use only one water orientation optimized for a single ionization state can therefore introduce larger errors than if the charges on the water dipole are simply ignored (M. R. Gunner, unpublished observations). Without explicit water molecules, some stabilization of nearby polar or ionized residues is implicitly included by DelPhi, which puts a high dielectric constant in any cavities large enough to accommodate a water molecule. DelPhi uses a grid-based, finite-difference method to solve Poisson's equation. A technique called focusing ensures adequate resolution in a protein as large as the Rp. viridis RC. A series of focusing calculations were made, centered on each site of interest (Gilson et al., 1987). All

water to the low-dielectric environment of a protein, the loss of reaction field energy is referred to as the desolvation penalty (AAGrxn). This shifts (ApKdesoIv) the ionization equilibrium toward the neutral form. However, interactions with specific polar and charged groups in the protein can compensate for the loss of reaction field energy to stabilize the ionized form of the residue. The groups in the protein are separated into sites whose charge or dipoles are always present and those groups whose charge state is the subject of these calculations. The former are referred to as pHindependent polar interactions and occur predominantly with the protein backbone and polar side chains. Their influence on the free energy is termed AGP.1, which gives rise to ApKpo,l. The pH-independent contributions can be combined with the pK of this type of residue in solution (pKS,,) to yield an "intrinsic pK" (pKjnt; Tanford and Kirkwood, 1957). The pKint is defined as the pKa that a titrating group in the protein would have if all other groups were in their neutral protonation states. Thus,

pKi.t = pK.,-Ca(APKdesolv + ApKpol)

(1)

where ca is -1 if the site is an acid and +1 for a base. The pH- and redox-dependent charge-charge interactions with other ionizable residues change the free energy of ionization by AGGcrg if and when these sites are ionized.

Calculation of amino acid titration by Monte Carlo sampling
For an ensemble of molecules of a protein with N titrating sites, there are 2N protonation states. Each protonation state of each protein molecule is defined by a vector of dimension N, x = (xl, x2, . .. xV), where xi is the protonation state of site i, specifying the number of protons bound (either 0 or 1). The free energy G(x) of the protonation state x is given by (Yang et al., 1993)

Formally, the average protonation of a site in the ensemble of proteins (xi) is found by determining the statistical average (Boltzmann weighted sum) of all 2N protonation states of the protein complex:

reported values are the result of a series of four calculations, with a final grid spacing of 0.59 A/grid. Under these conditions, the calculated energy of interaction varies with position in the grid by less than 1%. The electrostatic contributions of the free energy of a charge in the protein are separated into three energies, the reaction field energy (AG.,), the pH-independent interaction energy with partial charges on the protein backbone and polar side chains (AGP.1), and the pH (and redox state)dependent interaction energy with other ionizable residues (AGcrg) (Gunner and Honig, 1992). The reaction field energy (or Born energy or solvation energy) is the result of the polarization of electrons and dipoles in the media that stabilizes a charge. When an ionizable group is transferred from

where the sum is over all possible protonation states and Z is the partition function (Z = E {.e -G(x)/kT). However, use of Eq. 3 to determine (x) is only practicable for small proteins (Bashford and Karplus, 1990). For proteins with more than 25 titrating sites, the time required to compute the free energy of every state becomes prohibitive (Beroza et al., 1991). Instead, it has been demonstrated that Monte Carlo sampling of protonation states yields reliable titration curves, even for very large proteins with strongly interacting sites (Beroza et al., 1991). Previous calculations on RCs have used Monte Carlo sampling to determine the average protonation state of each protonatable residue (Beroza et al., 1995; Gunner and Honig,

1992).
The average ionization of each site is the average of 1.6 * 106 Monte Carlo sampled steps after 200,000 preequilibration steps. This provides a

precision of ±2% for the fractional protonation values of titrating residues. For the pH region between pH 5 and 11.5, 3.2 106 Monte Carlo steps after 1.6 * 106 preequilibration steps were employed. The longer computations provide a precision of ±1%, as judged by selected runs of 80 cycles of 200,000 Monte Carlo steps. The Monte Carlo algorithm incorporates intermal proton transfer by allowing two sites that are strongly interacting (IAGc:rJ > 2 ApK units, i.e., 2.76 kcal/mol) to change state in a single Monte Carlo step 50% of the time, as suggested by Beroza et al. (1991). In a complex group of interacting acids and bases, the titration of a residue may not be uniquely described by a single number in the form of a pKa value. The pK0' of a residue i will be defined as the pH value at which the average protonation (xi) is 0.5. As will become apparent below and has been shown by others previously (Bashford and Gerwert, 1992; Gunner and Honig, 1992; Beroza et al., 1995), the resulting titration curves are often quite different from classical (Henderson-Hasselbalch) single-site titration curves (cf. Figs. 3 and 4). Thus some residues have an average protonation of 0.5 over a range of pH values, as in a dicarboxylic acid, or display even more complex titration behavior (Sudmeier and Reilly, 1964), so that pKI' may not be uniquely defined. However, for most residues, the pK0' will provide a reasonable guide to the protonation state of this residue at a given pH value.

Calculation of proton uptake resulting from reduction of one or both of the quinones is accomplished by a separate calculation of the average site protonation for each of the redox states considered (cf. Fig. 1). Net proton uptake or release is obtained from the difference in average, summed protonation of all of the acids and bases in the RC (cf. Fig. 9 below). The role of individual sites is determined by subtraction of the average site protonation in the original state from that in the final redox state (cf. Fig. 4, below).

To facilitate the identification of strong interactions, values '2 ApK units are highlighted (except for those with the pH-independent charges of FeQ2' and its ligand Glu M232-. The information in the symmetric matrix is duplicated on both sides of the diagonal to facilitate the identification of all strong interactions associated with an individual residue. The division of residues between the QB cluster (this table) and the QA cluster (cf. Table 3) was not only based on direct couplings to the quinones alone. In some borderline cases, the stronger interactions with assigned members of the clusters were used as assignment criteria. Residues marked with a # are also listed in other tables as points of reference.

table site in a second series of calculations. Groups of residues can be identified with ionization states that are interdependent because of the large electrostatic interaction energy between the sites when they are ionized. These will be referred to as clusters. Given a threshold criterion that charge-charge interactions change the pK of a residue by 2 pH units, a cluster of 47 titrating residues is identified that are directly or indirectly (i.e., via other titrating residues) coupled to QA and QB. Tyr and Cys residues are omitted from these clusters because all Tyr and Cys that are considered to be titratable (cf. Materials and Methods) are found to be neutral in all redox states of the protein at all pH values. The clusters can be subdivided into a group of 23 residues more strongly coupled to the ionization state Of QB (the QB cluster; cf. Table 2), and another 24, which are more strongly coupled to QA (the QA cluster; cf. Table 3). The two clusters are linked via Glu M232, Asp H236, and Asp M238. Furthermore, the divalent cationic charge on the nonheme iron (FeQ) influences all residues near the quinones. Additional sites are found that change their ionization state in response to changes in the redox state of the quinones but have interactions smaller than the 2 ApK unit limit with the QA and QB clusters. These will be seen to lie in two regions, either on the cytoplasmic or on the periplasmic side of the protein complex. These cytoplasmic residues will be referred to as "marginal cytoplasmic sites" (cf. Table 4), and the periplasmic sites will be termed "isolated" (cf. Table 5). The rationale for this nomenclature will be discussed below.

CONTRIBUTION OF

IONIZATION OF THE ACIDS AND BASES IN THE QA AND QB CLUSTERS
Table 2 contains the cluster of residues strongly coupled to the redox state Of QB, Table 3 the sites coupled to QA, Table 4 the marginal cytoplasmic residues, and Table 5 the isolated periplasmic sites. Each of these four groups of residues differs in its reaction field energy (AAG.,) and interactions with polar groups (AGP,1). We will first focus on the QB cluster. Desolvation penalties for sites in the QB cluster are sufficient to shift pK values by as much as 10 pH units relative to pK,01 in the absence of compensating polar interactions (Table 2b). As expected, more deeply buried residues have larger desolvation penalties. Deviations are found for residues such as Asp M230 (12.0 A from the cytoplasmic surface) and Glu H177 (10.3 A from the cytoplasmic surface) that are near cavities that have a radius of -1.4 A and are therefore treated as having a dielectric constant of 80 by DelPhi. Also listed in Tables 2b and 3b are the coordinates along the membrane normal. Glu L104 is the only residue in the two tables that would be inside the low-dielectric region of the membrane. Despite the absence of a membrane model, this residue will be shown below to be neutral throughout the calculations. Thus, behavior ofthe

residues of interest in this work are not expected to be modified significantly by the omission of a membrane in the calculations. When the residues in the QB cluster (Table 2) are ionized, their net interactions with polar groups in the protein are often substantial. These charge-dipole interactions can modify site pK values by as much as 15.4 pH units (e.g., Asp

interactions (cf. Table 2a). Of the ionizable residues, only Glu L212, which is located 6.6 A away from the proximal carbonyl oxygen of QB, has a free energy of interaction with QB- of more than 2 ApK units. Glu L212 then interacts strongly with the nine residues Glu L210, Asp H174, Arg M231, Asp H125, Lys H133, Arg H181, Asp M230, Glu H177, and Glu M234. These residues, in turn, interact strongly with other residues. A number of other residues that modify the electrostatic potential in the vicinity of QB and the QB cluster without being able to play a role in coupling proton and electron transfer are also included in Table 2. Thus, the 2+ charge on the nonheme iron raises the potential throughout this region of the protein. Furthermore, its ligands Glu M232 and His L190 are coupled strongly to QB, but the former is always ionized and the latter always neutral because of their interaction with the FeQ2+. The electrostatic interactions are twice as large for QB2- than QB-. This raises the number of ionizable residues interacting directly with the quinone by more than 2 ApK units from 1 to 9. Also included as a protonatable residue is Ser L223, which in its protonated form is a potential proton donor to the reduced QB. This residue will be shown to be ionized only when QB is doubly reduced. A rough correlation is found between the reciprocals of the shortest distances between (de-)protonatable atoms and the charge-charge interaction energies (in Tables 2a-4a) of each pair of residues. However, there are deviations from a straight linear relationship that can be correlated with increasing solvent accessibility of the sites. For instance, most of the interactions with a magnitude of 2.3 ApK units are between sites approximately 10 A apart (e.g., Glu L212-Arg M23 1, Glu L212-Asp H 125) whereas the amino terminus of the M subunit (Ntr Ml) and Arg M226 interact equally strongly, but are only 4.7 A apart. The latter sites are much better solvated, which is reflected by low desolvation penalties (cf. Table 2b) leading to increased screening of the two interacting charges. QA is similar to QB in that there are few sites that have strong direct interactions with the quinone. The nonheme

iron FeQ and its ligand Glu M232 have almost identical interactions with both quinones. Glu L104 and Asp H36 are the only protonatable residues strongly coupled to QA. Glu L104 is deeply buried, and when it is protonated it can form a hydrogen bond to the ring V keto carbonyl group of OA and so has a pKjnt of 16.2 (cf. Table 3). It is calculated to be neutral in all redox states at all pH values. Although Asp H36 has a pKint of 7.6, it is involved in a salt bridge with Arg H33. This effect alone shifts the pKa of this residue by -9.1 ApK units, causing both residues to be ionized throughout the calculations. Interactions just above the 2 ApK unit threshold provide extensions of the cluster from Asp H36 to Glu H35 and Glu M261, which, in turn, interact strongly with other residues (cf. Table 3). The QA and QB clusters are the same size (24 and 23 residues, respectively). Each shows the quinone to be coupled to the cluster via a very small number of sites. However, there are a number of significant differences between the two clusters. The QB cluster has 13 acidic residues and 10 basic residues, resulting in a surplus of three acidic residues. This imbalance is maintained in the center of the cluster, where Glu L212 interacts strongly with twice as many acidic as basic residues (vide supra). The average desolvation penalty in the QB cluster is 6.6 ApK units. Without considering the interactions with the nonheme iron, the iron's ligand Glu M232, or QA' there are 87 chargecharge interactions with energies greater than 2 ApK units. In contrast, the 24 residues of the QA cluster (10 acidic, 14 basic) are coupled by only 41 strong charge-charge interactions (cf. Table 3a) and experience an average desolvation penalty of 5.5 ApK units. In summary, the QA cluster differs from the QB cluster in four important characteristics. The QA cluster has a surplus of basic residues, whereas the QB cluster has a surplus of acidic residues; the QA cluster has fewer and smaller charge-charge interactions within the cluster; its residues are more solvated; and, as discussed above, the dipolar groups stabilize negative charges less than in the QB cluster.

The marginal cytoplasmic sites represent a diverse group. The four isolated cytoplasmic residues (Glu M22, Glu H97, Glu H216, and Lys M3 1) are virtually solvent-exposed, with an average desolvation penalty of 0.6 ApK units, and are electrostatically isolated. The other marginal cytoplasmic sites (Arg M1 34, amino terminus (Ntr) L1, and Glu H234) are part of several strongly coupled miniclusters that are coupled to residues of the QA or QB clusters by interactions below the 2 ApK unit threshold (cf. Table 4a). These three residues experience an average desolvation penalty of 5.5 ApK units. The isolated periplasmic sites are part of a single, large cluster of interacting residues around the primary donor D and within the C subunit. These residues are virtually isolated from QA, QB, and their associated clusters (cf. Table 5), but their pKa values are in the pH range of

interest, so even small changes in the electrostatic potential cause shifts in their protonation state.

CALCULATION OF TITRATION CURVES BY MONTE CARLO SAMPLING Redox state DQAQB In the ground state (DQAQB) the isoelectric point of the RC, i.e., the pH value at which the net charge is zero, is calculated to be 5.8, which is slightly lower than the value of 6.5 observed experimentally by Welte et al. (1983). At pH 7, all Arg, and all but one Asp, all but eight Glu, and all but two Lys residues as well as three propionates are calculated to be fully ionized, whereas all Tyr and all but one of the His

2478

residues are found to be neutral. The exceptions are found in Table 6. The three carboxy termini of the L, M, and H subunits are all ionized. The C subunit carboxy terminus is not resolved in the crystal structure and was not included in the calculations. The amino terminus of the H subunit is formylated and therefore not ionizable. None of the other amino termini are fully ionized at pH 7. The groups with fractional ionization listed in Table 6 are distributed throughout the protein. Despite the excess of basic residues, all residues in the QA cluster are ionized between pH 5.5 and 10.5, except for Lys H66, which titrates with a pK_' of 9.1, and Glu L104, which is neutral. Within the QB cluster, residues are predominantly ionized between pH 5.0 and 10.5, despite the excess of acidic residues and high desolvation penalties. The exceptions are the amino terminus of the M subunit and His H72, which are predominantly neutral, and the three residues Glu L212, Glu H177, and Glu M234. These three form a strongly interacting unit that will be referred to as the Glu cluster. The titration curves for the three glutamic acids, as calculated by Monte Carlo sampling, are shown in Fig. 3. The most striking feature is that Glu L212 is calculated to be more protonated at high pH than at low pH values (Fig. 3 a). Despite a pKjnt of 3.6, this residue appears to be more than 50% protonated to at least pH 11. The strong charge-charge interactions when other residues in the Glu cluster are ionized (cf. Table 2a) destabilize the negative charge on Glu

L212. At pH values below 7, these two Glu residues are partially protonated, allowing ionization of approximately 35% of Glu L212. At higher pH (>8.0), Glu H177 and M234 are predominantly ionized, whereas Glu L212 is now more protonated. None of the three Glu residues exhibits a typical Henderson-Hasselbalch titration curve. However, the sum of the fractional protonation of the Glu cluster is approximately described by such a curve, with a total protonation of 2 near pH 5, and of 1 near pH 11. The pKa', pK2", and pKr"' values of the Glu cluster are defined as the points of inflection in the calculatedtitration curve, corresponding to a summed fractional protonation of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5, respectively. We shall concentrate primarily on the pKa' values for the equilibrium between the singly and doubly protonated states of the Glu cluster in the different RC redox states. In the ground state (DQAQB) it is 6.4. The pKa' value, i.e., the equilibrium between the doubly and triply ionized states, is calculated to be much greater than 20 in the ground state because Glu L212 remains overwhelmingly neutral when the other two acids are ionized. The pK"' value (i.e., the equilibrium between the doubly and fully protonated states) is only important for the state DQAQB2- (cf. below). In summary, these three glutamates act as a tightly coupled cluster of interdependently titrating residues within the larger QB cluster. These will be seen to function as a buffer for the QB site.

Proton uptake coupled to changes in the redox state of the quinones Even though the exact assignment of partial ionization within the tightly coupled cluster is difficult to calculate owing to the interdependence of the ionization of sites, protonation changes are quoted to two significant figures after the decimal point. This is done because many sites are calculated to exhibit small changes in protonation, and the rounding error would be substantial if the second decimal were ignored. The work reported here does not consider redox states involving the oxidized primary donor D+ or oxidized cytochromes. Formation of D+ leads to proton efflux to the periplasm (calculated to involve particularly Asp Ml 82 and Glu C254, two of the "isolated" periplasmic sites; Table 5). There are likely to be additional changes as the hemes in the C subunit are oxidized as D+ is reduced (Gao et al., 1990). Although the redox events near the periplasm modify the total proton uptake, this is calculated to have no influence on the protonation of the QB and QA clusters, which is the focus of the work reported here, so that these states are excluded from this study.

spond to the total proton uptake by the protein when the RC goes from the ground state to the DQA- state. At pH 7.0, the net, average change for the entire protein complex is +0.57 protons per RC (see Table 6). This is predominantly due to nine sites that bind at least 0.01 H+ per site and one periplasmic site that releases more than 0.01 proton per site (see Fig. 4, c and a). Despite the stronger interaction between the QA cluster and QA, the protonation of each site of

the QA cluster except for Lys H66 (+0.01 H+) is unaffected at neutral pH by the ionization state of QA. Rather, the bulk of the proton uptake on reduction of QA is in the QB cluster, with +0.35 H+ localized in the Glu cluster. At pH 7 this is mostly due to protonation of Glu M234 (see Fig. 4 c). The reduction of QA shifts the pKa" of the Glu cluster from 6.4 to 7.1 (Fig. 3 b). In addition, the marginal cytoplasmic site Ntr LI binds on average +0.13 H+, whereas isolated periplasmic sites bind +0.06 HW. Fig. 4 a shows that the stoichiometry of proton uptake after reduction Of QA is remarkably independent of the pH, remaining between 0.4 and 0.6 H+/RC between pH 5 and 11. However, the sites that are responsible do change as the pH changes. Thus, proton uptake at higher pH is now due to charges in the QA cluster, predominantly Lys H66 (+0.36 H+ at pH 9.5; cf. Fig. 4 a). Consequently, between pH 6.0 and pH 8.0, the QB cluster dominates the total calculated uptake of the protein, whereas between pH 8.0 and pH 10.5, residues in the QA cluster are more important. The effect of having such a large group of residues with interdependent ionization properties is that at different pH values, different residues change their ionization, but the net proton uptake is relatively constant. In addition to the important role of the groups in the QA and QB clusters, the residues in Tables 4 and 5 are calculated to contribute to proton uptake after electron transfer. The change in ionization of these isolated sites is a consequence of the sensitivity of the protonation state to small changes in the electrostatic potential when the residue is near its pK. Thus, at the pK a 10-meV change in the free energy of ionization, corresponding to a shift of 0.17 ApK units, will change the average protonation by 0.1 proton. Although the contribution of the individual sites is small at neutral pH, they contribute 0.1 to 0.3 H+ to the total protonation of protein over the entire pH range (cf. Figs. 5 c).

7.0, the net change for the entire protein complex is +0.62 H+ (see Table 6). The net uptake by the Glu cluster is 0.49 H+, which is approximately evenly divided among the three individual residues. In addition, there are small contributions by isolated periplasmic (e.g., Asp M182) and marginal cytoplasmic (e.g., Ntr LI) sites. Apart from these five residues, no protonation differences larger than 0.01 H+ are observed at this pH value. The Glu cluster within the QB cluster dominates the calculated total uptake for the protein between pH 6 and 8.5. Thus, the peak in total proton uptake at pH 6.5 corresponds to the maximum for the cluster. The

QA cluster makes its most significant contribution near pH 9. Above pH 9.5 the largest contribution is from Arg M134 (+0.29 H+ at pH 11) of the isolated cytoplasmic sites. The pKa" of the Glu cluster is increased from 6.4 to 7.4 as the reaction center goes from the ground DQAQB to the DQAQB state.

Ntr LI (see Table 6). The net uptake of the Glu cluster is +0.74 HW. An additional +0.02 H+ is provided by the QA cluster. The pKa" of the Glu cluster is 8.3, 1.9 pH units higher than in the ground state (cf. Fig. 3 d).
Redox state DQAQB2- and the transition DQAQB -> DQAQB2

Formation of the QA- or QB- states yields substoichiometric proton uptake that is distributed among several residues. In contrast, the state DQAQB2 creates large changes in the equilibrium ionization state of the protein (see Fig. 5 a and Table 6). Thus, the pKa" of the Glu cluster shifts from 7.4 in the state DQAQB- to approximately 36, demonstrating the destabilization of the doubly ionized form of the cluster in the presence Of QB2 .In this state, the pKa"' value of the Glu cluster, referring to the pK of the cluster for the binding of the third proton, was determined to be 8.4 (it is below 0 in all the other redox states). The pKa of the nearby Asp M43 undergoes a shift of approximately 17 units upon formation of the state DQAQB2- from much less than 0 to 7.7. The net difference between the ground state DQAQB and the state DQAQB2-, i.e., after the transfer of two electrons to QB, is shown below in Fig. 9 c. At pH 7, if the protein came into equilibrium without proton transfer to QB the net change in protonation of the whole protein is calculated to be 2.82 HW. Protonation changes greater than +0.20 H+ per site are restricted to the members of the Glu cluster, which binds an extra + 1.52 H+, and Asp M43, which binds on average 0.55 H+ at pH 7. The contribution of the isolated sites is 0.3-0.6 H+ up to pH 9 and increases to 1.0 H+ at pH 11 (+0.7 H+ at pH 11 is accounted for by Arg M134). The summed contribution of the QA cluster and the QB dominates the total uptake of the protein in the pH range 6-10.5.
Explicit inclusion of the protonation of Ser L223 in the redox state DQAQB2

and the induced shifts in residue protonation. The change in potential was obtained, given the charge on the quinone plus the calculated average protonation of each residue at pH 7 in each of the five important redox states. The resulting electrostatic potential differences are displayed as color-coded contour maps shown in Fig. 6. This enables the impact of the changes in protonation shown in the titration curves to be followed within the RC structure. The primary impact of the reduction of QA is to make the vicinity Of QA more negative (see Fig. 6 a). There is some compensating proton binding. However, at pH 7, the latter change is seen to occur predominantly in the vicinity of QB. This is due mostly to an increase in the average protonation of Glu M234 by +0.28 H+ and a small increase in protonation of Glu H177 (+0.06 H+). This proton uptake near QB on reduction of QA may be important for preparing the QB site to receive an electron from QA. When the electron is transferred from QA to QB at pH 7, the primary change is that QA is more positive and QB is more negative (see Fig. 6 b). In response, the QB cluster binds an additional +0.14 H+. This involves protonation of Glu H177 (+0.06 H+) and Glu L212 (+0.15 H+), partially at the expense of deprotonation of Glu M234 (-0.08 H+). When visualized in terms of molecular geometry (cf. Fig. 6 b), this effect can be understood as a substoichiometric proton transfer from Glu M234 (which is 13.8 A from QB) to Glu H177 (8.1 A from QB) and Glu L212 (6.6 A from QB) to achieve better charge compensation for the negative charge arriving on QB. The impact of the proton transfer within the QB cluster can be seen in the difference in the size of the negative contour when QA- is formed and when QB is formed. The smaller increase in negative potential at QB is due to the increase in positive potential at Glu L212. The response upon transfer of the electron to QA in the presence of QB- is similar to that found for the first reduction of QA (cf. Fig. 6 c in comparison to Fig. 6 a). Thus, again the predominant change at neutral pH is around the

QB site.
Considering all five RC redox states (cf. Fig. 7 a) and excluding protonation of QB and Ser L223, almost all of the change in charge induced on the whole protein at neutral pH can be accounted for by the sum of the fractional protonation of the four acidic residues Glu L212, Glu H177, Glu M234, and Asp M43 (8.3 A away from QB). Allowing Ser L223 to be protonatable has no influence on the results for the first four redox states (i.e., up to and including DQA-QB-; cf. Fig. 7 b compared to Fig. 7 a). In the state DQAQB2, Ser L223 is protonated at the expense of Asp M43 and, partially, Glu M234 (cf. Fig. 6 e).

The presence of a doubly reduced QB appears to perturb the environment of the QB site so much that Ser-OH22+ could become an accessible intermediate. When a protonatable Ser is included in the calculations with a pK.01 of -1.7, 2.97 protons are bound by the protein on the transition DQAQB -> DQAQB2- at pH 7, with +0.67 H+ accounted for by isolated sites (see Table 6). The Glu cluster displays a net change in protonation of + 1.26 H+ (see Table 6), and the calculated uptake for Ser L223 is + 1.0 HW.

a wide pH range, stabilizing reduction of the quinones. The cluster has properties that make some features easier to calculate and others harder to determine than is found for isolated residues. Generally, residues change their protonation state when the redox state is changed in the pH regions where the acid or base is partially ionized. If a strongly coupled di-acid is used as a model for the cluster, the region

of fractional ionization can be expected to extend over a wide pH range. It is relatively easy to estimate the fractional protonation in this range, and this value is not sensitive to the exact value of the first and second pK. However, it is generally very difficult to determine which half of the di-acid is ionized. In the same way, it is likely that the net protonation of the cluster in each redox state and the overall

(1995) required that sites have a direct interaction with QB- of at least 0.8 ApK units. Cometta-Morini et al. (1993) did not give a specific criterion for the presentation of "selected" residues. The location of the QB cluster identified in Table 2 is shown in Fig. 8. It extends for over 33 A from the solvent-accessible residue His H72 (on the left of Fig. 8 b) to the solvent-accessible amino terminus of the M subunit, Ntr Ml (on the right of Fig. 8 b), thus providing at least two possible entry points for cytoplasmic protons. The maximum distance within the QA cluster is 28 A (from Arg H86 to Arg M265). Again, there are widely separated residues within this cluster that are solvent accessible. The distance is 25 A from the solvent-accessible residues Arg H86 to Arg H38, or, from Arg H233 to Glu H61.

stoichiometry of proton uptake may be well estimated, whereas there is greater uncertainty in the identification of the residues that play a role at each pH. In addition, the assignment of fractional ionization of residues in the cluster over a wide pH range implies an underlying heterogeneity in any ensemble of RCs. In contrast, the isolated sites are only fractionally protonated in a small pH range near their pK. Errors in estimation of the pK of 1 pH unit are to be expected in the calculations reported here (Yang et al., 1993). This will shift the pH range in which an isolated residue changes protonation state. This may provide the largest source in the error in the total stoichiometry of proton uptake at a each pH.

Why does the QA cluster not contribute to proton uptake at neutral pH? There is experimental evidence that QA is never directly protonated, whereas QB is only protonated as it becomes doubly reduced (see Okamura and Feher, 1992, for a review). Partial protonation of the surroundings in response to the reduction of the quinone assists in providing a kinetically competent proton donor. As has been presented here, this is the role of the residues in the QB cluster near QB. There is a similar cluster of protonatable residues near QA (cf. Table 3). However, these do not seem to provide the local proton uptake needed to either stabilize a second electron on QA or to allow kinetically competent proton donation to the quinone. The QA and QB clusters are both linked to their protonatable cluster by only one residue, Asp H36 near QA and Glu L212 near QB. These acids are at a similar distance from the quinone and experience large changes in the free energy of protonation when the quinone in ionized. However, Asp H36 is involved in a salt bridge with Arg H33, which stabilizes the charge on the acid so that it remains ionized when QA is reduced. If a second electron were placed on QA, this Asp would now be calculated to become protonated, but this would be coupled to the disruption of the salt bridge to Arg H33. In contrast, Glu L212 is most strongly coupled to two other glutamic acids. The Glu cluster provides a structure that is partially protonated in each redox state and which can therefore bind protons at each stage of quinone reduction. In fact, it appears that it is the Glu cluster near QB that is protonated when QA is reduced. This may provide a mechanism to prestabilize electron transfer from QA to QB. In contrast, protonation near QA could provide undesirable stabilization of the electron on QA, which would disfavor electron trans-

try-related cluster sites are Glu L210/Glu M244, Arg L217/ Arg M251, and Arg L231/Arg M265. The other contributions from the QB cluster that are in portions of the protein that are identified as homologous at the level of the backbone conformation (Glu L 212 and Glu M261) are changed to nonionizable residues in the QA cluster (Ala M 246, and Leu L227). Other important residues are in the segment M226 to M239, which is not symmetry-related to the L subunit. In addition, residues from the H subunit that caps the cytoplasmic surface of the protein and has different contacts to the L and M subunits play key roles. A revertant of a Rhodobacter capsulatus mutant in which the sequence comprising the QA binding site is duplicated and the native QB binding site sequence is deleted (QAQA mutant) provides some experimental support for a picture where the protein near QA plays a role that is similar yet distinct from that of the residues near QB. This mutant will support photosynthetic growth (Coleman and Youvan, 1993; further characterized by Li et al., 1995), indicating that although it is possible to deliver electrons to the modified QB site, there are substantial kinetic barriers to the process that may reflect differences in proton transfer.

determined values. The importance of particular residues can in principle be monitored by infrared (IR) spectroscopy (Mantele, 1993, 1995). In addition, the results of sitedirected mutagenesis and second-site revertants can provide evidence for the location of critical residues.
Comparison of the measured and calculated stoichiometry of proton uptake as a function of pH

Proton uptake by RCs in response to the reduction of QA and QB has been measured by monitoring the solution pH with proton-sensitive dyes (Wraight, 1979; Maroti and Wraight, 1988a), using a pH electrode (McPherson et al., 1988) and by conductometric methods (Maroti and Wraight, 1988a; Maroti, 1993a). These techniques provide a sensitive monitor of the loss of protons from the solution as they are bound by the RCs. However, measurement of proton uptake in Rp. viridis RCs is difficult because it is masked by concomitant proton release coupled to oxidation of the cytochrome subunit during re-reduction of the special pair (Maroti, 1993a). Some guidelines can be taken from the more abundant data for the Rb. sphaeroides RC (Maroti, 1993a).

electron to QA is compared with the experimental results for the Rb. sphaeroides RC by McPherson et al. (1988) and Maroti and Wraight (1988b) in Fig. 9 a. The experimental profile is reproduced reasonably well by our calculations, with errors of less than 0.2 H+/RC. At neutral pH, the surplus of approximately +0.2 H+ can be accounted for by the marginal cytoplasmic sites, and the joint contribution of the QA cluster and the QB cluster of +0.37 H+ (cf. Fig. 4 c) at pH 7 corresponds very well with the experimental value of McPherson et al. (1988). DQAQB -> DQAQB-- The calculated and experimental pH profiles for the transfer of the first electron to QB are compared in Fig. 9 b. The calculated proton uptake is generally smaller than that observed experimentally, with differences ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 H+/RC. However, it can be noted that there is also some uncertainty in the experimental results. The Rb. sphaeroides data of McPherson et al. (1988) are similar to the data for the Rp. viridis RC (Maroti, 1993a), whereas the Rb. sphaeroides data of Maroti and Wraight (1988b) display considerably higher proton uptake (0.7 to 0.9 H+) at lower and medium pH values. The latter results disagree significantly with those obtained more recently by the same laboratory (Shinkarev et al., 1992), which in turn are more similar to those reported by McPherson et al. (1988). We will therefore primarily compare our calculated data with the experimental data of McPherson et al. (1988). The features of the experimental profile with maxima at pH 6 and pH 10 and a minimum at pH 8 are reproduced reasonably well by our calculations, which lie within the experimental extremes from low pH values to pH 9.0. However, at high pH the calculated proton uptake is too low. One possible reason for the discrepancy is that the structure used as a basis for these calculations was determined at pH 6.0 (Lancaster and Michel, manuscript in preparation), and that structural changes may occur at higher pH values (Maroti, 1993b). DQAQB-> DQAQB2 . It has been a matter of debate (Okamura and Feher, 1992) whether the second electron transfer precedes or follows the uptake of the first proton. Recent deduction of free energy changes associated with the formation of QBH2 indicates that transfer of the second electron to QB precedes the first proton uptake (McPherson et al., 1994). Recent QA substitutions for low potential quinones by the same laboratory (Graige et al., manuscript submitted for publication) have shown the rate of second electron transfer from QA- to QB-, k(2)AB, to increase with increasing driving force, indicating that electron transfer is the rate-limiting step. This would still be consistent with the existence of QB2- if slow electron transfer were to precede fast proton transfer. However, the authors conclude that their results indicate a mechanism in which rate-limiting electron transfer follows rapid proton transfer, thus disfavoring the existence of QB2- On the other hand, a QBH intermediate (cf. Fig. 1) has yet to be detected. However, even if DQAQB2- is not an intermediate state, the exploration of the changes in RC protonation on formation of DQAQB2- remains of interest. The changes in protonation

help to identify the protonatable groups that are far out of equilibrium with the state DQAQB2- and so destabilize its formation. In addition, this calculation may provide insight into the groups that are energetically more likely to be transiently protonated on the pathways that provide protons to QB. In Fig. 9 c the experimental and calculated pH profiles are compared for the transfer of both electrons to QB. The fit of the calculated profile to the data of McPherson et al. (1993) is poor. Although the profile of the contribution of the QB cluster reproduces the experimental data in an excellent manner, the reasons for these two profiles are different. Whereas the experimentally observed drop in proton uptake at higher pH was attributed to the titration of QBH- with a PKa of -8.5 (McPherson et al., 1993), the calculated profile is effectively determined by the pK. of 8.4 for the binding of the third proton in the Glu cluster in the redox state DQAQB2- (cf. Fig. 5 a). The latter is clearly not an equilibrium state, because QB2- is rapidly protonated. Nevertheless, the correspondence between the data and calculations indicates that proton transfer intothe Glu cluster could be a necessary step for proton and electron transfer to QB7
Comparison with IR spectroscopic results

Our calculations indicate that proton uptake in response to electron transfer to the quinones is not accomplished by a single site at any pH value. This is consistent with results from IR vibrational spectroscopy, where absorption changes in the region of the protonatable amino acids upon changes in the quinone redox states can be interpreted to indicate that several residues participate in substoichiometric protonation changes. The best characterized residue is Glu L212. An increase in the IR absorption band at 1725(1728) cm-' upon QB- formation has been assigned to the protonation of Glu L212 in Rb. sphaeroides RCs (Hienerwadel et al., 1992b, 1995). Changes in this signal are observed for the

indicating substoichiometric protonation of Glu L212 for all three transitions. At pH 7.0, our calculations indicate an uptake of +0.02 H+ on Glu L212 for the DQAQB DQA-QB transition and an additional +0.15 H+ for the DQA-QB -> DQAQB- transition. Although quantification of the uptake measured by Fourier transform (FT) IR difference spectroscopy is difficult, proton uptake for the of Rp. viridis DQAQB DQAQB- transition in the RCs (Breton et al., 1991) is estimated to be half of the 0.3 to 0.6 H+ determined for Rb. sphaeroides RCs (Hienerwadel et al., 1995). In this case, the calculated value of +0.17 H+ would be consistent with the experimental data. Static FTIR difference measurements in the ground and QB- states has confirmed that there is less proton uptake by Glu L212 in Rp. viridis than in Rb. sphaeroides RCs (Breton et al., 1995).

nals in the FTIR difference spectra. In particular, one candidate for the currently unassigned negative signal at 1736 cm-1 in a QA- QB -> QAQB- double difference spectrum on Rp. viridis RCs (Hienerwadel et al., 1992a) is Glu M234, which is calculated to release protons upon transfer of the first electron from QA to QB (cf. Fig. 6 b). The general finding that, below pH 8.5, the QB cluster responds more strongly to the reduction Of QA than the QA cluster (cf. Fig. 5 a) is consistent with the observation that upon reduction of QA generally the same signals are observed in FlIR difference spectra as for the reduction of QB, but they have smaller amplitude (W. Mantele, personal communication). With respect to the residue Glu L212, this finding is also consistent with the calculations of Beroza et al. (1995), and experiments by McPherson et al. (1994), Tiede and Hanson (1992), Sebban et al. (1995a), and Maroti et al. (1995) on the RCs of Rb. sphaeroides and Rb. capsulatus, respectively.
Comparison with the behavior of mutant RCs The work presented here proposes that an extended cluster that includes distant residues is important for proton delivery to the QB site. This picture receives support from revertants where second-site mutations lead to the restoration of photocompetence in mutants incapable of proton transfer. Thus, Arg M231 (Hanson et al., 1993; further characterized by Maroti et al., 1994, and Sebban et al., 1995b) and Arg L231 (Hanson et al., 1995), which are found as second-site mutations in Rb. capsulatus RCs, are both located in the QB cluster (cf. Table 2), more than 10 A (Arg L 231) and 15 A (Arg M23 1) from QB. respectively. In particular, Arg M231 is found to be strongly coupled to more than half the residues in the QB cluster (cf. Table 2), and so might play an important role in establishing the electrostatic environment necessary for proton transfer. Based on the spectroscopic analysis of site-specific mutants of the reaction center from Rb. sphaeroides (reviewed by Okamura and Feher, 1992; Takahashi and Wraight, 1994) it was suggested that the first proton to QB is transferred via Asp L213 and Ser L223, and the second via Asp L213 and Glu L212. In Rp. viridis, residue L213 is an asparagine. However, its role can apparently be complemented (Rongey et al., 1993) by Asp M43 (which corresponds to Asn M44 in Rb. sphaeroides). Relative to the Asp L213 -> Asn single mutant, the double mutation Asn M44 -Asp and Asp L213 -> Asn in Rb. sphaeroides RCs increases kV1)AB approximately sixfold and k(2)AB approximately 5000-fold (Rongey et al., 1993), indicating that this residue is far more important for the second electron transfer than for the first. Proton transfer is accelerated by a ratio similar to k(2)AB (Rongey et al., 1993). Mutation of Asp L210 in Rb. sphaeroides, corresponding to Glu L210 in Rp. viridis to Asn, has little impact on electron transfer or proton uptake (Paddock et al., 1992). This residue is not found to change its protonation state in the calculations presented here.

A recent mutation of Glu H173 to Gln (Takahashi and Wraight, 1995) in Rb. sphaeroides, corresponding to Glu H177 in Rp. viridis, has been shown to give rise to a transfer rate for the second electron from QA to QB that is 100-fold slower than in the wild type. This kinetic result corroborates our findings of an important role for Glu H177, especially for proton uptake associated with the transfer of the second electron to QB (see Fig. 7).

Comparison to other computational results Qualitative agreement of the calculated stoichiometry of proton uptake has been found in the calculations of Beroza et al. (1995) on the RC of Rb. sphaeroides. However, the calculations presented here seem to fit the experimental profile of McPherson et al. (1988) somewhat better. Although both computational profiles for DQAQB DQA-QB (cf. Fig. 9 a) are within 0.2 H+ of the experimental profile of McPherson et al. (1988) between pH 5.5 and 9, the calculations reported here provide a closer match to the experimental data for the reduction of QB between pH 5 and 8.5, with less than 0.25 H+ deviation (cf. Fig. 9 b). In general, the calculated desolvation penalties, polar interactions, and charge-charge interactions are larger in our study than in the calculations of Beroza et al. (1995) for the Rb. sphaeroides RC, and in some cases the difference is large. For instance, the interaction energy between Glu L212 and Glu H173 (Glu H177 in Rp. viridis) is reported by Beroza et al. (1995) to be 2.6 ApK units, whereas it is 5.4 ApK units in Table 2. The effect of decreased desolvation penalties and polar interactions reported by Beroza et al. (1995) approximately cancel in some cases to yield similar pKint values (e.g., pK1nt(Glu L212) = 3.7 (Beroza et al., 1995) and pK1nt(Glu L212) = 3.6 (Table 2)). The two sets of calculations have been performed with the same probe radius and the same dielectric constants for solvent and solute. However, the algorithm that defines the surface is different (P. Beroza, personal communication). Somewhat larger electrostatic energies were also reported in earlier calculations on the Rb. sphaeroides RC (Gunner and Honig, 1992) using the same methods as described here. Careful consideration of the discrepancies between the work of Beroza et al. (1995) and Gunner and Honig (1992) showed that these were due to differences in coordinates and to the surfacing algorithm. One significant difference is that Glu M236 (Glu M234 Rp. viridis), which is in the Glu cluster here, is not found to be in the QB cluster in the calculations of Beroza et al. (1995). The reason for this difference is most probably the different conformation of the Glu side chain (Ermler et al., 1994), which in turn is caused by the species differences Gly H73/Arg H70 and Ala H121/Arg HI 18 (higher numbering refers to Rp. viridis), thus causing Glu M236 in the Rb. sphaeroides RC to be oriented toward these two Arg residues and away from Glu L212 and Glu H173. There are three main sources of possible differences between the results reported here and those of Beroza et

al. (1995). First, there are small differences in the amino acid composition of Rp. viridis and Rb. sphaeroides RCs, notably the Asn L213/Asp M43 and Asp L213/Asn M44 change. Second, the coordinates used by Beroza and co-workers (4RCR; Yeates et al., 1988) are significantly less well defined than the coordinates used for the calculations reported here (cf. Lancaster et al., 1995, for a discussion). Last, there are some differences in the parameters used in the calculations. The partial charges on the quinone and bacteriopheophytin molecules are larger in the calculations presented here (cf. Table 1). The charge distribution on A has the largest impact on Glu L104 because the neutral (protonated) form of Glu L104 is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to the ring V keto carbonyl of bacteriopheophytin 4A. In the work of Beroza and co-workers (1995) this residue is reported to titrate in the high pH range with a pKa of 13 in the ground state (DQAQB) (Beroza et al., 1995, Fig. 3 a), and some proton uptake by this residue is calculated to occur upon reduction of QA (Beroza et al., 1995, Fig. 4 a). In the calculations reported here, the larger charges on A yield more stabilization in the neutral form in AGPO1 for this residue. The result is that Glu L104 is calculated to remain fully protonated throughout the pH range studied. Another difference in the outcome of the two calculations concerns the titration of Arg M247 in Rb. sphaeroides (Arg M245 in Rp. viridis). Beroza et al. (1995) report an anomalous titration for the ground state DQAQB, beginning at pH -5 and ending with -20% protonation at pH 15 (cf. Beroza et al., 1995, Fig. 3 a). This leads to the calculation of proton uptake by this residue upon reduction of QA (cf. Beroza et al., 1995, Fig. 4 a). In contrast, this residue is calculated to be fully protonated at all pH values for all redox states in the work reported here. The difference is due to a significantly more favorable AG., from backbone dipoles and from the side chain Thr M241/243. This Thr is differently oriented in the two structures. In the best defined structure of the Rb. sphaeroides RC (IPCR, Ermler et al., 1994), the Thr M243 side chain has an orientation similar to the structure on which these calculations are based (cf. Lancaster et al., 1995, for a recent comparative discussion of RC x-ray structures). Instead of a Glu cluster of Glu L212, Glu H177, and Glu M234 (corresponding to Glu L212, H173, and M236 in Rb. sphaeroides), Beroza et al. (1995) identify a different cluster of three acidic residues: Glu L212, Asp L213, and Asp L210. A possible reason for the different composition of the cluster is the species difference at position L213, which is Asn in Rp. viridis. (vide supra). The inverse titration calculated for Glu L212 in our work is not observed for this residue by Beroza et al. (1995), but instead is observed for Asp L213. In both cases, this inverse titration behavior may be a result of the limitations of computational model (Beroza et al., 1995), although there is some experimental evidence for an anomalous titration behavior of Glu L212 (Hienerwadel et al., 1995).

Implications for pathways and kinetics of proton transfer
We have calculated the effect of changes in the redox state of the quinone cofactors, as they occur during electron transfer, on the protonation states of the titrating sites in the RC. Stoichiometric proton uptake is only calculated to occur upon transfer of the second electron to QB-- In contrast to calculations on the transfer of the first electron, those for the second electron are not true equilibrium calculations. This applies especially to the state DQAQB2-, where the equilibrium state is for both protons to be bound by the doubly reduced QB. This means that the "equilibrium" protonation uptake calculated for Asp M43/Ser L223 and the Glu cluster will not become fully established before protons are bound by QB2- Nevertheless, the residues calculated to take up protons upon formation Of QB2- are likely candidates for transient protonation upon transfer of the second electron to QB-- Other participants in the pathways of proton transfer are very likely to be directly or indirectly hydrogen-bonded to these residues. Our findings are summarized in Fig. 10, which includes the residues of the QB cluster and the QA cluster as well as crystallographically determined water molecules. The residues of the Glu cluster are highlighted with bold frames in Fig. 10, as are Asp M43 and Ser L223. A number of different pathways are possible for protons to reach these five residues from the cytoplasm. The recent observation of a continuous water chain from the cytoplasmic surface to QB in the structure of the RC from Rb. sphaeroides (Ermler et al., 1994) implies an involvement of water molecules in the pathway of proton transfer. Because our calculations do not include water molecules as protonatable groups, it cannot be ruled out that some of the fractional protonation calculated for individual amino acid residues is actually "shared" with adjacent water molecules (cf. Fig. 10). The pathway of proton transfer could include some or possibly all of the water molecules associated with the QB cluster. Two possibilities for protons to enter the RC are either via water W261/Ntr Ml or via His H72. The first pathway would then lead via tightly bound water molecules (cf. Fig. 10) to Asp M2. Because this residue is strongly electrostatically coupled (cf. Table 2) to Asp M230 and Glu H235, the latter two residues could be the next participants in the pathway. From Glu H235, protonation could proceed via Asp H125 and W 110 to Glu M234 of the Glu cluster. From Asp M230, protonation of Glu H177 of the Glu cluster could occur. Proton transfer within the Glu cluster is possible via the two tightly bound water molecules W187 and W92. The second pathway via His H72 would require proton transfer via one or two disordered water molecules and further ordered water molecules to Glu M234, to which it is coupled. These two pathways involve amino acid residues solely of the QB cluster. Other pathways are possible if additional disordered water mol-

FIGURE 10 Schematic diagram of residues identified in Tables 2 and 3. This diagram includes water molecules identified in the x-ray structure of the quinone-reconstituted RC (Lancaster and Michel, manuscript in preparation). Waters with numbers greater than 162 were not identified in the structure of Deisenhofer et al. (1995). Solid lines (-) link residues and water molecules that are within hydrogen bonding distance (<3.5 A). Dashed lines (-- - ) designate longer distances (explicitly given in angstroms). Bold frames highlight the five residues identified in Fig. 7. Frames with wave patterns designate residues that are at least partially solvent exposed (i.e., 1.2 A or less from the solvent accessible surface); cf. Tables 2 and 3). The gray background defines the QB cluster (cf. Table 2), the white background the QA cluster (cf. Table 3).

ecules are assumed to be part of them, or if members of the QA cluster are considered to be directly involved. Transfer of a proton from Glu H177 in the Glu cluster to Asp M43 coupled via water molecules WIOI and W229 is straightforward. Through transfer of the proton from Asp M43 via a disordered water molecule, protonation of Ser L223 could occur in the state DQAQB2-. This residue has been shown to be involved in stabilizing the reduced quinone and in efficient donation of the first proton to the distal oxygen of QB in the Rp. viridis RC (Leibl et al., 1993) and the Rb. sphaeroides RC (Paddock et al., 1990). The second proton could then be transferred from Glu L212 (Okamura and Feher, 1992; McPherson et al., 1994), probably via water Wi 13 and one or two disordered water molecules, to the proximal quinolate oxygen.

residues L212, H177, and M234 near QB accounts for the net effect of this charge compensation at neutral pH for all redox transitions up to and including the diradical state DQA-QB-. This Glu cluster is part of a larger interacting network of ionizable residues around QB (QB cluster) that extends to the solvent accessible surface. An analogous cluster of ionizable residues around QA (QA cluster) has different electrostatic properties. In particular, it is not so strongly coupled and apparently is not involved in proton uptake at neutral pH. The fit of the calculated data to experimental results is better than in previous publications. The calculated complex titration behavior of the strongly interacting residues of the QB cluster may be a common feature in proton-transferring membrane proteins.

CONCLUSION
The work presented here demonstrates how light-induced electron transfer is coupled to the uptake of protons and how electrostatic calculations can help to identify amino acid residues that are possibly involved in proton uptake to the QB site. A strongly interacting cluster of the three Glu
