Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) is a serine endopeptidase which hydrolyses proline-containing peptides shorter than 30-mer. POP is believed to be associated with cognitive functions via neuropeptide cleavage. POP has been also connected to the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3 ) signalling but the effects of POPinhibition to the IP3 accumulation in vivo are still unclear. However, little is known about the physiological role of POP in the brain. We have previously found that in the rat brain POP was specifically expressed in the pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex, particularly in the primary motor and somatosensory cortices, and corresponding projection areas in thalamus. Using a retrograde neurotracer we have now visualized the localization of POP in thalamocortical and corticothalamic projection neurons in ventrobasal complex and medial geniculate nucleus of thalamus and somatosensory/motor and auditory cortices. We observed that both in thalamus and cortex over 50% of projection neurons contained POP. These results support the hypothesis that POP is involved in thalamocortical and corticothalamic signal processing. We also propose, based on our neuroanatomical findings and literature, that POP may take part in the thalamocortical oscillations by interacting with IP3 signalling in cells. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP, prolyl endopeptidase, EC 3.4.21.26) is an ancient 80 kDa enzyme that belongs to the POP family of serine proteases (family S9 of clan SC) [35]. It is widely distributed in various organs and in the CNS, and even body fluids contain POP-like activity [4,11,13,24]. POP has been implicated in the hydrolysis of many proline-containing bioactive peptides such as the angiotensins, arginine-vasopressin, substance P and thyrotropinreleasing hormone (for reviews, see refs. [12,20]). Several of these putative POP substrates are known to be involved in crucial functions of the CNS, such as memory and learning [20]. Furthermore, alterations in POP enzyme activity have been measured in several brain diseases [21]. These findings have served as the rationale for developing POP enzyme inhibitors. Although the effects of POP inhibitors on the neuropeptide levels in the brain are still far from clear [15,20], these compounds have restored decreased neuropeptide levels in some studies [3,33] and prevented the cognitive symptoms in animal models (for review, see ref. [20]). Recently, several reports have provided evidence that POP may be involved in IP3 signalling in vitro [37,38] and even suggested that POP may be a direct target of val-

proic acid [7]. Finally, POP may be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation [24,27]. However, the physiological function of POP has remained unclear. We recently used immunohistochemistry to study the distribution of the POP protein in the human, rat and mouse brain [23,25] and in the mouse peripheral tissues [24]. POP is widely but specifically distributed in the body even though it does not seem to have any neurotransmitter specificity in the brain or cell type specificity in the peripheral tissues. Interestingly, in the rat brain, a great quantity of POP protein was present in the various thalamic nuclei, such as ventral posterior complex (VP, ventrobasal complex), ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM) and medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Furthermore, POP was highly expressed in the pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex, especially in the primary somatosensory (S1) and primary motor cortices (M1), that are known to have reciprocal connections to the VP and VM of thalamus [23,28]. Similar connectivity has also been seen between MGN and its primary projecting area, primary auditory cortex (Au1) [28]. Moreover, we recently found an abundant colocalization of POP and inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3 ) in the thalamus where IP3 may participate in thalamocortical (TC) oscillations [9,22]. These findings suggest a novel role for POP in signal transduction of the CNS since thalamus is the most important relay station between lower parts of the CNS and the cerebral cortex [28].

(A­L) Representative immunofluorescence photomicrographs depicting the colocalization of POP and Fluoro-gold (FG) in medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and ventroposteromedial nucleus of ventral posterior complex (VP) and in the primary somatosensory (S1) and auditory (Au1) cortices. Schematic figures of rat brain sections (adapted from ref. [29]) depict the injection sites of FG (black spots) and corresponding projection area (black triangles). Colocalization was determined by measuring green-labelled neurons which is the result of the merging of POP (red) and FG (yellow) images. White whole arrows indicate those neurons, and arrowheads point to POPimmunoreactive cells devoid of FG. Interestingly, a significantly larger number of FG-positive neurons was colocalized with POP than vice versa. Scale bars are 20 m except in the G, H and I where it is 10 m.

The present study was undertaken to study the spatial localization of POP in reciprocal projection neurons of thalamus and cortex, using retrograde neurotracing and the POP immunofluorescence (IFL). The aim was to find experimental confirmation of our hypothesis that POP is involved in the thalamocortical and corticothalamic (TC/CT) signal transduction, and in this way to further clarify the physiological role of POP. All chemicals used were purchased from Sigma­Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless stated otherwise. NaCl was from FFChemicals AB (Yli-Ii, Finland) and ethanol from Altia (Helsinki, Finland). Young male Wistar rats (n = 13; cortical injections n = 7, thalamic injections n = 6; 7­9 weeks old, 250­350 g, supplied by the National Laboratory Animal Center, University of Kuopio and University of Helsinki) were housed under controlled conditions. Room temperature was 22  C and light/dark cycle 12/12 h. The animals had free access to food and water. All animal procedures were conducted according to the Council of Europe (directive 86/609/ECC) and Finnish guidelines, and approved by the local animal ethics committee and State Provincial Office of Eastern Finland. Stereotaxic surgery was performed under isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. The rat was placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting,

Wood Dale, IL, USA) and a stainless steel guide cannula was lowered 2.0 mm above the infusion site. An infusion needle was lowered 2.0 mm below the tip of the guide cannula. The coordinates for the final infusion site measured from bregma were: S1/M1 cortex: AP: +0.2, L: -2.2, DV: -2.0; Au1 cortex: AP: -4.4, L: -7.0, DV: -5.2; VP/VM: AP: -3.3, L: -3.0, DV: -5.4; MGN: AP: -5.3, L: +3.6, DV: -5.4 (Fig. 1, [29]). Fluoro-gold (FG, Fluorochrome, Denver, CO, USA) was dissolved in saline solution. In all, 1 l of the 4% FG-infusion was injected for 2 min using Exmire or Hamilton microsyringe (1 ml) run by a motor-driven slow-motion syringe pump (CMA/102, CMA Microdialysis, Solna, Sweden). The needle was retained in position for 2 min after the infusion of FG. Fourteen days post-infusion, the rats were deeply anesthetized using chloral hydrate and then perfused with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After perfusion, the rats were decapitated, the brains were frozen and stored at -70  C until sectioning into 50 m cryosections with a sliding microtome (Leica SM2010, Leica Microsystems Inc., Wetzlar, Germany). The polyclonal POP antibody was prepared as described earlier [25,34]. Briefly, purified E. coli expressed recombinant human POP (for details, see ref. [34]) was used to generate antibodies against POP in a hen. Egg yolks were collected and IgYs were isolated by the i

water dilution method [16] and POP-specific IgY was then purified by affinity chromatography using a HiTrap NHS column coupled with purified mammalian POP as reported [34]. Antibody specificity in the rat brain was assayed by Western blotting using rat brain homogenates while purified recombinant pig POP served as a control. In all experiments, only one band at around 80 kDa, corresponding to the full length POP, was detected [25]. The antibody did not react with human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5, a gift from GlaxoSmithKline), the closest relative of POP [35], in Western blot experiments (data not shown). Moreover, tissue preadsorption control remained free of POP-immunoreactivity [23]. In colocalization studies between POP and FG, the IFL technique was used (for details, see refs. [22,23]). Briefly, free-floating sections were first incubated in blocking solution for 40 min followed by an overnight incubation with POP antibody (dilution 1:500). After TBS washing, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h (dilution 1:500, Rabbit anti-chicken IgY Texas Red-conjugated, Abcam #ab6751, Cambridge, UK). Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) was used as a mounting medium to demonstrate the nuclei of the cells. No separate staining for FG was needed since it fluoresces naturally. Wavelengths for FG were 331 nm (excitation) and 418 (emission), and for Texas Red 596 nm and 620 nm. Control stainings for IFL were carried out with the omission of the primary antibodies. No evidence of any staining was observed in these negative controls (data not shown). IFL photomicrographs were captured by a digital camera connected to the Olympus BX40 microscope and DP50 Digital Camera (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and corrections for brightness and contrast were made with Adobe Photoshop CS2 software (version 9.0, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Mountain View, CA, USA). The identification and nomenclature of the brain structures were based on the rat brain atlas by Paxinos and Watson [29]. The percentages of colocalizations in double-labelling immunofluorescence were calculated as described earlier [22,23] by comparing the FG-positive neurons with POP immunoreactive neurons and vice versa and using Abercrombie's correction [1]. The results are shown in Table 1. The colocalization percentage for each area was calculated from at least 4­6 different immunostainings and the average of counted cells per region was 19 ± 1 (mean ± SEM). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 4.03, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). One-way ANOVA followed by Newman­Keuls multiple comparison tests was performed to analyze differences in FG colocalization with POP (Table 1) between brain areas. Statistically significant differences were considered as P < 0.05. In this report, we studied colocalization of POP with a specific retrograde neurotracer, FG, in TC and CT projection neurons of S1 cortex and VP, and Au1 cortex and MGN. Injection sites of FG and

the corresponding projections sites that were examined by IFL are schematically shown in Fig. 1 (left panel). Overall, the colocalization between POP and FG was significant and very similar in all analyzed brain areas (Table 1). The highest colocalization between POP and FG was seen in the MGN (61%, Fig. 1A­C). However, even the lowest colocalization percentage was as high as 52% (S1 cortex, Fig. 1D­F). Similar colocalizations were seen in the VP areas, ventroposterolateral (VPL) and ventroposteromedial (VPM) nuclei, in VM and in Au1 cortex (Table 1, Fig. 1G­L). When the colocalization of FG-positive neurons with POPimmunoreactive neurons was analyzed, the highest colocalization was seen in the VPL (68%, Table 1, Fig. 1G­H). The colocalization was higher in FG-positive neurons than in POP-immunoreactive neurons also in VPM, VM, M1 and Au1 cortices (Fig. 1, Table 1). Generally, the colocalization was higher when FG-positive neurons were compared to POP-immunoreactive neurons rather than vice versa (P < 0.05, Student's t-test). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where the expression of POP in TC and CT projection neurons has been visualized. In our previous study [23], we showed that POP protein is expressed in various nuclei of thalamus and the corresponding projecting areas of cortex [28]. In this study, we have now shown that the majority of POP-immunoreactive neurons both in the S1 and Au1 cortices and VP and MGN nuclei of the thalamus are indeed projection neurons. These results support a role for POP both in TC and CT signal transduction. Thalamus is the most important processing area in signal transduction between the lower CNS and cortex. Almost all sensory information is relayed to the cerebral cortex via the TC neurons of the thalamus [28]. On the other hand, the true nature of functions of the CT circuits is largely unknown. It has been suggested that these circuits enhance the precision of stimulus responses [2,36]. The connections between thalamus and cortex also form thalamocortico-thalamo circuits that may be involved in the regulation of consciousness [14,30]. We reported before [23] that with the exception of layer 1, there was slightly less POP expression in layer 4 of the S1 and M1 cortices than in other layers. Thalamocortical projections of sensory nuclei, such as MGN and VP, primarily terminate to layer 4 in Au1, S1 and M1 cortices while corticothalamic projections have afferents in pyramidal cells of layers 5 and 6 that are rich in POP protein [23,28]. Furthermore, in this study, we found that the colocalization of POP with projection neurons containing FG was almost equally high in thalamus and cortex. This suggests to a more significant role for POP in CT connections than in TC connections. Interestingly, no POP-immunoreactivity was seen in the lower parts of the CNS, such as spinal cord, or even in the posterior thalamus [23]. This points that POP is involved in signal processing only in the superior parts of the CNS. With the exception of the GABAergic neurons in the reticular nucleus, TC and CT projection neurons are glutamatergic [28]. Sev-

eral neuropeptides such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone, orexin and somatostatin seem to be involved with TC and CT neurotransmission [6,17,18]. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is a known in vitro and in vivo substrate for POP, and orexin and somatostatin are also potential substrates for POP based on their size and structure (for review, see ref. [12]). Interestingly, these neuropeptides have either excitatory effects on thalamocortical signalling via modification of the action potential [6,17] or they are able to inhibit GABAergic neurotransmission in the thalamus (somatostatin, [18]). These results suggest that POP would be involved in the regulation of excitatory neurotransmission between thalamus and cortex. If POP was the enzyme responsible for cleaving these neuropeptides in thalamus in vivo, one could postulate that POP could well act as an inhibitor of TC and CT neurotransmission. However, the link between POP and neuropeptide cleavage in vivo is still rather unclear [15,22], and therefore, other substrates than neuropeptides or non-catalytic mechanisms for actions of POP in the CNS needs also to be considered. POP has been related to IP3 signalling which is an important regulator of the calcium release [5,10,38]. Hence, the POP-mediated regulation of TC and CT connections may occur via calcium signalling. Calcium induced spike bursts in the thalamus are strongly connected with the thalamocortical oscillations that are important phenomena in arousal and epilepsy [8,31]. Although neurons in the central thalamus (midline nuclei of thalamus and intralaminar nuclei) are the best known regulators of wakefulness [30], similar oscillations occur also between the VB and S1 cortex [19,32]. In some studies, IP3 was directly connected with the thalamocortical oscillations [9], and in our previous study [22], we reported a very high colocalization of POP and IP3 in the thalamus, including VB. Moreover, valproic acid (VPA) ­ a mood stabilizer and a common antiepileptic drug ­ has been claimed to modify thalamocortical oscillations but possibly not through the GABAergic system [26,39]. VPA is connected both to IP3 signalling [37] and POP [7]. Since POP is located in the thalamocortical neurons between the VB and M1/S1 cortices, and there is an abundant colocalization of POP and IP3 in the thalamus, we suggest that there might be an IP3 -mediated role for POP in the regulation of thalamocortical oscillations. The physiological role of POP in the CNS is still unclear. Here we report that POP, at least in spatial terms, is located in the projection neurons connecting thalamus and brain cortex (and vice versa) inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission. It is also possible that POP may participate in the regulation of thalamocortical oscillations via the IP3 and calcium signalling.
