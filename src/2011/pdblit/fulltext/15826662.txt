Abstract The enzymes 6-hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) catalyze sequential steps in folate biosynthesis. They are present in microorganisms but absent in mammals and therefore are especially suitable targets for antimicrobials. Sulfa drugs (sulfonamides and sulfones) currently are used as antimicrobials targeting DHPS, although resistance to these drugs is increasing. The most widely used assay that measures activity of these enzymes, to assess new inhibitors in vitro, is not amenable to automation. This article describes a simple, coupled, enzymatic spectrophotometric assay where the product of the DHPS reaction, dihydropteroate, is reduced to tetrahydropteroate by excess dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) using the cofactor NADPH. The oxidation of NADPH is monitored at 340 nm. The activity of both HPPK and DHPS can be measured in this assay, and it has been used to measure kinetic parameters of wild-type and sulfa drug-resistant DHPS enzymes to demonstrate the utility of the assay. It is a sensitive and reproducible assay that can be readily automated and used in multiwell plates. This NADPH-coupled microplate photometric assay could be used for rapid screening of chemical libraries for novel inhibitors of folate biosynthesis as the Wrst step in developing new antimicrobial drugs targeting the folate biosynthetic pathway.

Folate cofactors are essential components of several enzymatic reactions occurring in nearly all cells and are essential for life. They are involved in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines (thymidylate), the biosynthesis of amino acids such as glycine and methionine, and the biosynthesis of vitamins such as pantothenic acid [1]. The reactions involve the transfer of one-carbon units to and from folate cofactors. Microorganisms and plants are able to synthesize folates in a pathway involving six enzymes, starting with GTP cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.16) [2]. Mammals lack this pathway and must obtain folates from the diet in a process involving speciWc folate uptake receptors [3]. The absence of a folate biosynthetic pathway in mammals

makes the enzymes of this pathway ideal targets for antimicrobial drugs. Indeed, the Wrst chemically synthesized antimicrobials--the sulfonamides or sulfa drugs--targeted one of these enzymes, namely dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS2, EC 2.5.1.15) [4]. These sulfa drugs are still widely used, usually in combination with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, EC 1.5.1.3) inhibitors, to treat bacterial infections (sulfamethoxazole), malaria (sulfadoxine), and Pneumocystis pneumonia (sulfamethoxazole).

dapsone, is used to treat leprosy in combination with other drugs. Together, these combinations work synergistically and slow the development of drug resistance signiWcantly. However, resistance to these drugs evolves and is increasing [5]. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to combat these widespread diseases. In prokaryotes the folate biosynthetic enzymes are expressed as individual monofunctional proteins, whereas in some eukaryotic microorganisms these enzymes often are expressed as multifunctional enzymes. For example, in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for the most serious form of malaria, two enzymes catalyzing sequential steps in folate biosynthesis occur as a bifunctional protein with 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK, EC 2.7.6.3) and DHPS activities [6]. This is also the case for Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite causing opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients [7]. Three sequential enzymes of this pathway occur as a trifunctional protein in the fungus Pneumocystis carinii [8], a cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients (often referred to as PCP [P. carinii pneumonia]). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a similar trifunctional enzyme [9]. These proteins contain enzyme activities of dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA, EC 4.1.2.25) as well as HPPK and DHPS activities. Recently, we generated a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the HPPK and DHPS domains of the S. cerevisiae multifunctional protein. This was overexpressed, puriWed, and crystallized [10], and its three-dimensional structure was determined in a complex with a substrate analog [11]. Our aim is to develop new drugs that target these enzyme activities using structure-based drug design, incorporating in silico screening of chemical libraries followed by in vitro evaluation of potential inhibitors. The evaluation of potential inhibitors discovered in the process requires a robust rapid assay to test potentially a large number of chemicals. The method currently in use to measure the activities of HPPK and DHPS involves incorporation of radioactively labeled substrate into the pterin precursor, separation of labeled substrate from product by thin-layer chromatography, and measurement of the incorporated label [12,13]. This method is slow and tedious and is not suited to high-throughput screening necessary to identify and characterize potential inhibitors. The alternate patented method [14] uses pyrophosphatase to measure pyrophosphate released from the DHPS reaction. However, this is not a real-time method; rather, it requires that the reaction be stopped and that pyrophosphatases be added to measure pyrophosphate formed in the reaction well. Thus, this assay methodology necessitates multiple reactions at numerous time points to achieve kinetic data. This article describes a new method for assaying HPPK and DHPS activities that is rapid, is continuous, and can be readily automated for rapid screening of chemical libraries for potential inhibitors. To demonstrate its usefulness, the binding constants for three sulfa drugs with wild-type and sulfa drug-resistant forms of the enzyme are determined here.

Materials and methods Enzymes The yeast bifunctional HPPK­DHPS enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and puriWed by metal aYnity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography as described previously [10]. The His6 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage, and the enzyme was stored in 50% glycerol at ¡20 °C. The QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to generate the four mutant DHPS alleles from the HPPK­DHPS construct [15]. The wild-type yeast construct has the sequence T557R558P559 (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] entry P53848), whereas the single mutant alleles are TRS559 (called TRS DHPS here) and A557RP (ARP DHPS). The double mutant alleles are V557RS559 (VRS DHPS) and A557RS559 (ARS DHPS) [16]. The numbering system for S. cerevisiae DHNA­HPPK­DHPS diVers from the earlier numbering of this protein in that the start site for the gene has been moved 40 codons downstream [17]. The E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain transformed separately with the four N-terminal His6-tagged pET-28a.Sc HPPK­DHPS vectors was grown in 2£ YT medium supplemented with 40 g/ ml kanamycin as described previously [10] for the wild-type enzyme. The proteins were also puriWed as described previously [10]. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (Bio-Rad, Regents Park, Australia). Dihydrofolate reductase (bovine liver) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Reagents 6-Hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphate (Schircks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland) was reduced with sodium dithionite­ascorbic acid to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate and puriWed by ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q resin as described previously [10]. This DHPS substrate was stored in aliquots at ¡80 °C. 6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin, 7,8-dihydropteroate, 7,8-dihydrofolate, and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate were obtained from Schircks, and p-aminobenzoic acid (p-ABA) and NADPH were obtained from Sigma. 4-Amino-N-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl)benzene sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole, Sigma), 4-aminophenylsulfone (dapsone, Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA), and 4-amino-N-(6-chloro3-pyridazinyl)benzene sulfonamide (sulfachloropyridazine, ICN Biomedicals, Seven Hills, Australia) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, BDH AnalaR) to 100 mg/ml. Working dilutions were made in DMSO from these stock solutions. Assay Initially, the assay was carried out in 0.6-ml quartz spectrophotometric cells (Starna, Thornleigh, Australia).

BuVers and reagents were equilibrated at the assay temperature, and the assay was started by the addition of HPPK­ DHPS. The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored over 3 min in a Pharmacia Biotech Ultraspec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham­Pharmacia Biotech, Boronia, Australia), and the initial enzyme rates were determined. Here 1 unit of enzyme activity is equal to the formation of 1 mol of dihydropteroate per minute. For the assay, a series of reagent mixes where one of the substrate concentrations was varied (for the determination of Km, Ki, or V) was made. BuVers used to make up reagent solutions were purged with nitrogen to reduce oxidation of the pterins. Final concentrations of reagents in the standard assay were as follows: 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5.0 mM MgCl2, 20 mM -mercaptoethanol, 50 mM NADPH, 50 mM 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin or the pyrophosphate, 50 mM p-ABA, and 1.0 g/ml DHFR. ATP (Wnal concentration 100 M) was included when HPPK activity was being measured (with 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin as cosubstrate). The sensitivity of the assay was measured under these conditions with a series of dilutions of the enzyme. Five determinations were carried out for each dilution, and the sensitivity was determined as the lowest enzyme concentration where there was a signiWcantly increased rate of reaction above the uncatalyzed rate. To determine the intraassay variation, the assay was repeated a total of 10 times and the means § SD was calculated. Interassay variation was determined using data from 10 standard assays carried out on separate occasions. The activities of DHFR toward both dihydrofolate and dihydropteroate were measured, and the V and Km values were determined. For the 96-well plate assay, Nunc Nunclon plates (cat. no. 167008, Medos, Mount Waverley, Australia) were used and were read at 340 nm in a Thermo Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Pathtech, Box Hill South, Australia) maintained at 37 °C in an incubator. The total volume used was 150 l, with 135 l reagent mixture and 7.5 l test compound in water or in DMSO (5% Wnal concentration of DMSO), and the reaction was started by the addition of 7.5 l HPPK­DHPS (at 20 g/ml). Plates were incubated at 37 °C and shaken before monitoring the absorbance. Each well was read a total of 50 times with 8 s between readings (total time 6.67 min). The rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm for each well was determined after exporting the absorbance data from the plate reader software via MS Excel into GraphPad Prism (version 4.0). To determine the Km values of p-ABA with wild-type enzyme and the four mutant isoform DHPS enzymes, a reagent mixture containing all reactants except p-ABA and the enzymes was used. A series of dilutions of p-ABA was made, starting with a 400-mM working dilution and down to a 2.0- M solution (giving Wnal concentrations from 20 mM to 0.1 M in the wells). V and Km values were determined by using Hanes plots [18]. To determine binding constants for three sulfa drugs, the wild-type and four mutant alleles of the enzyme were

assayed by varying the concentration of the sulfa drug in the 96-well plate assay (treating the sulfa drugs as substrates). The Km values were determined from the Hanes plots. To calculate the factor to convert changes in absorption at 340 nm to enzyme rates in nanomoles per minute, the absorbance (340 nm) of the products of the reaction (NADP+ and tetrahydropteroate) Wrst must be subtracted from the total absorbance of the substrates (NADPH and 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin diphosphate). p-ABA has no signiWcant absorbance at this wavelength. The absorption of a 50- M solution of the pterin substrate plus 50 M NADPH was measured in a 1-cm quartz spectrophotometric cell and in wells of a 96-well plate. This was compared with the absorption of a solution containing 50 M NADP+ and 50 M tetrahydropteroate. Complete conversion of 50 nmol/ml of substrates to products would give a change in absorption at 340 nm of 0.552 in the UV cell (an eVective molar absorptivity change of 11,040 M¡1 cm¡1) and of 0.298 in the wells. From these values, the change in absorption was converted to nanomoles per minute. The concentrations of the reactants were determined from their molar absorptivity values as follows: pterin substrate ­ 277 D 20,000 M¡1 cm¡1 [19] and NADPH ­ 339 D 6200 M ¡1 cm¡1; NADP+ ­ 260 D 18,000 M¡1 cm¡1; tetrahydropteroate (concentration based on that of tetrahydrofolate) ­ 297 D 29,100 M¡1 cm¡1 [20]. Results The DHPS assay described here is a coupled enzyme assay where the dihydropteroate, formed from the condensation of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate with p-ABA catalyzed by DHPS, is reduced to tetrahydropteroate by an excess of DHFR with NADPH as the cofactor. These reactions are shown in Fig. 1. DHFR catalyzes the reduction of its natural substrate dihydrofolate approximately Wve times faster than it does dihydropteroate, although the Km values for the two substrates are similar (Km D 1.7 M for dihydrofolate and 1.4 M for dihydropteroate). If HPPK­DHPS is omitted from the reaction mixture, there is no reduction of the substrate. Similarly, if p-ABA, 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate, or DHFR is omitted from the mixture, there is no reaction. If p-ABA is replaced by a sulfa drug--sulfamethoxazole, dapsone, or sulfachloropyridazine--there is no observed reaction without DHPS, indicating that the drugs themselves are not reduced by DHFR/NADPH. The assay can also be used to measure DHPS enzyme activity using sulfa drugs as substrates in place of p-ABA. If 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate is incubated with a sulfa drug and DHPS, a pterin­sulfa adduct is formed [21]. This can be separated from the starting materials by anion exchange chromatography. The adduct is then reduced by incubation with DHFR and NADPH as for dihydropteroate (results not shown).

Fig. 1. Enzyme reactions of the folate biosynthetic pathway involved in the assay. A series of reactions leads to the formation of dihydropteroate that subsequently is conjugated to glutamate in a reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate synthase (DHFS). The resulting dihydrofolate is reduced to tetrahydrofolate (a reaction catalyzed by DHFR). In the assay, the DHFS step is "bypassed," with the dihydropteroate formed being reduced directly to tetrahydropteroate by DHFR/NADPH.

The limit of detection of the assay as described here is 0.05 g/ml of wild-type S. cerevisiae DHPS enzyme (measured over 6 min) and at least 0.2 g/ml for the HPPK activity. The response is linear over at least a 10-fold range of enzyme concentration for HPPK and a 17.5-fold range for DHPS (Fig. 2). Increasing the HPPK­DHPS concentration gives a proportional increase in measured activity (r2 D 0.990 for DHPS activity), with a doubling of enzyme concentration giving a 1.97-fold increase in activity. For HPPK activity, r2 D 0.975 and a doubling of enzyme concentration gives a 1.98-fold increase in activity. The assay is reproducible, with an intraassay variation of 5.4% (interassay variation 10.6%) for the DHPS activity (n D 10) and an intraassay variation of 5.7% (interassay variation 11.1%) for HPPK activity (n D 10). The V and Km values for DHPS and HPPK activities for the wild-type enzyme are summarized in Table1. The assay was also used to measure kinetic parameters of four mutant alleles of DHPS. The mutations in these alleles, constructed in our laboratory, are associated with resistance to sulfa drugs in vivo [16,22]. The mutations that aVect the binding of the sulfa drugs to the active site of DHPS also aVect the binding of p-ABA to this site. The Michaelis constants (Km) for p-ABA for the four mutant alleles were determined by assaying DHPS activity over a wide range of p-ABA concentrations. For example, the rates for one allele, ARP DHPS, were measured in a single 96-well plate with 28 p-ABA concentrations ranging from 0.1 M to 20 mM. The 11 rates spanning the concentration

Fig. 3. Determination of the Km for p-ABA for the yeast bifunctional HPPK­DHPS enzyme with a single mutation at T557 (ARP DHPS). A range of concentrations of p-ABA, from 0.1 M to 20 mM, was assayed in triplicate for DHPS activity in a single 96-well plate. DHPS substrates 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8dihydropterin pyrophosphate and NADPH were 50 M. The concentration of the DHPS was 6.1 g/ml in the wells. The plate was incubated at 37 °C, and the A340 was read over 6 min. The individual rates for 10 M to 2.5 mM p-ABA, where the greatest change in enzyme rate with change in p-ABA concentration occurred, are shown in (A). The Hanes plot (p-ABA concentration against [p-ABA]/enzyme rate) is shown in (B). The Km for p-ABA for this allele of DHPS, calculated from the Hanes plot, was 103 M.

was 0.9997. This was repeated for all of the alleles and the Km and V values calculated from the plot, and these are listed in Table 1. The assay was used to measure the binding aYnities of three sulfa drugs--sulfamethoxazole, sulfachloropyridazine, and dapsone--for the wild-type and four mutant alleles. The Km values can be measured directly in the assay when the sulfa compounds replace p-ABA as the second substrate. The concentration of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate was held constant at 50 M, whereas the concentrations of the sulfa drugs were varied. Hanes plots were used to calculate the Km and V values, and these are listed in Table 1. The enzyme rate curves for the three sulfa drugs with wild-type DHPS are shown in Fig. 4A, and the corresponding Hanes plot is shown in Fig. 4B. Discussion The enzymes of the folate biosynthetic pathway have been targets for antimicrobials for many decades. Sulfonamides and sulfones that inhibit DHPS are still commonly used to treat infectious diseases such as malaria, pneumococcal diseases, and urinary tract infections. However, resistance to this class of drugs is widespread and increasing [5].

An estimated 2­3 million deaths per year are attributed to malaria, with another 2 to 3 million deaths being due to pneumococcal diseases and still another 2 million being due to tuberculosis, mostly aVecting young children in the developing world. Thus, there is a growing and pressing need to develop new and eVective drugs to treat diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. To develop new drugs, one approach is to screen chemical libraries for compounds that inhibit or interact with the target enzyme. The published assays for DHPS and HPPK activities involve incorporation of radioactively labeled substrates and thin-layer chromatographic separation of the products. This method is far too slow and laborious to enable a signiWcant number of compounds to be screened for activity. Recently, a method based on the use of pyrophosphatase to hydrolyze the pyrophosphate formed in the DHPS reaction and measurement of the inorganic phosphate formed was patented [14]. Although this is a signiWcant improvement on the previous method, it requires a second addition of reagents after the incubation step and measures only one time point per well. The method described in the current article is a continuous microplate assay method that allows rapid and accurate kinetic analysis of the enzyme reactions. It is based on coupling the reaction catalyzed by DHPS to the

Fig. 4. Determination of the binding constants for the three sulfa drugs--dapsone, sulfachloropyridazine (SCP), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)--to yeast wild-type DHPS. The enzyme was incubated with diVerent concentrations of the sulfa drugs in the 96-well assay. The measured rates are plotted against the substrate concentrations (A) or the substrate concentration/rate against substrate concentration (Hanes plot) (B). The binding constants for the three sulfa drugs were read from the plot (where the intercept on the x-axis D ­Km).

oxidation­reduction of NAD(P)H­NAD(P)+, which is commonly used in assays and is well understood [23,24]. The assay depends on the ability of DHFR (whose usual substrate is dihydrofolate) to reduce dihydropteroate to tetrahydropteroate. That this reaction takes place has been demonstrated previously using E. coli DHFR [2], where the product of the reaction was identiWed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Although dihydropteroate is not as good a substrate as dihydrofolate, excess DHFR added to the reaction ensures that this is not the rate-limiting step of the coupled reaction. The assay has been applied to measure the activities of HPPK and DHPS, and theoretically it could be used to measure the activity of DHNA, which catalyzes the reaction preceding that catalyzed by HPPK in the folate pathway. The assay as described here has been set up to measure initial enzyme rates to give accurate measurements of kinetic properties of DHPS enzymes and of inhibitor constants. Faster reading of the 96-well plates could be used for screening for enzyme inhibitors if high accuracy of enzyme rates is not required. The parameters of DHPS enzyme activity reported here are similar to those obtained with the radioactivity assay (incorporation of radioactively labeled p-ABA into the pterin substrate) [10]. Enzyme activity (V) of DHPS from diVerent species ranges from 0.011 U/mg for the P. falciparum DHPS with a Km for p-ABA of 1.25 M [13] to 0.6 U/mg for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme with a Km for p-ABA of 0.37 M [25] and 1.32 U/mg (Km D 3.4 M for p-ABA) reported here. Resistance to sulfa drugs in, for example, Pneumocystis jirovecii is associated with mutations in the DHPS gene at T517 (to Ala [equivalent to T557 in the S. cerevisiae trifunctional protein]) and P519 (to Ser [P559]) [26]. The presence of both mutations (A517RS519) in a clinical isolate is associated with a higher degree of resistance. A laboratory isolate with a double mutation, V517RS519, also has greatly increased resistance [16]. This increased resistance to sulfa drugs is reXected in the binding constants of p-ABA to the enzyme's active site. The single mutant alleles have p-ABA binding constants 14- to 30-fold higher than the value for the wild-type enzyme, whereas the

double mutant alleles have Km values 500- to more than 1000-fold higher than the value for the wild-type enzyme. The binding constants of three sulfa drugs in common use were measured with wild-type and four mutant alleles. The method used to measure the Km values was the kinetic assay with the pterin pyrophosphate and sulfa drugs as substrates but without p-ABA. The Km values determined here are equivalent to the Ki values where the inhibitor of the enzyme is also a substrate for the enzyme [18]. Other researchers have measured Ki values by varying both p-ABA and sulfa drug concentrations [13,27]. However, the sulfa drugs take part in the DHPS reaction and are converted to pterin adducts [21], making interpretation of the results from this method diYcult, especially if the reaction rates for p-ABA and sulfa compounds are similar (as they are shown to be here). The kinetic constants were measured in this study by treating the sulfa drugs as the substrate and using Hanes plots to measure the Km values [18,28]. For the single mutant allele, TRS DHPS, the Km values for the sulfa drugs are 6- to 22-fold higher than the value for the wild-type enzyme. For the double mutant alleles, the values are 89 to 1900 times the value for the wild-type enzyme. For the second single mutant allele (ARP DHPS), the results were anomalous, with the enzyme being from 2.3-fold more sensitive (sulfamethoxazole) to 3-fold less sensitive (dapsone), as measured by the Km values. This is in agreement with our earlier data showing that for ARP DHPS (the S. cerevisiae DHNA­HPPK­ DHPS expressed in E. coli), the minimum inhibitory concentration of drug required to give 100% inhibition of growth was 4-fold lower for sulfamethoxazole than for wild-type DHPS (whereas the other mutant alleles required higher concentrations of drugs for this inhibition) [16]. The results for sulfamethoxazole and sulfachloropyridazine show that the two compounds have similar aYnities for the wild-type and mutant isoforms of the enzyme. Previous studies on whole cells have shown that the cells are more sensitive to sulfachloropyridazine inhibition, and this may be the result of diVerent permeabilities of the cells to the two drugs [26].

In most cases, the mutations that lead to decreased binding of p-ABA to the enzyme also result in decreased aYnity of the sulfa drugs, with the exception being the ARS mutation. Although p-ABA and the sulfa drugs bind to the same pocket in the DHPS active site, there are diVerences in the orientation of the binding of these substrates and diVerences in the side chains in the active site interacting with these substrates [29]. This DHPS assay was found to be robust and straightforward with attributes of high sensitivity, low variation, rapid assays, and rapid data analysis. The assay was used in a 96-well format to measure kinetic properties of DHPS and inhibition of the enzyme activity by sulfa drugs. The assay could be readily miniaturized further to a 384-well format and, with robotic delivery of reagents, would be suitable for rapid screening of chemical libraries to Wnd inhibitors of the enzymes activities. Because DHPS and DHFR catalyze reactions involving closely related molecules, potential inhibitors of DHPS might also inhibit DHFR. To determine which activity (if not both activities) is being inhibited in this assay, a separate assay with DHFR, dihydrofolate substrate, and potential inhibitor would be included in any screen for inhibitors. Thus, this assay (not patented) oVers a methodology to aid research and development into replacement drugs for diseases such as malaria, pneumococcal diseases, PCP, and perhaps tuberculosis that are ravaging populations in developing nations.
