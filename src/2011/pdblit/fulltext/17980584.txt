Abstract--Based on lead compound 1 identified from the patent literature, we developed novel patentable BACE-1 inhibitors by introducing a cyclic amine scaffold. Extensive SAR studies on both pyrrolidines and piperidines ultimately led to inhibitor 2f, one of the most potent inhibitors synthesized to date. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of amyloid plaques comprised of Ab40,42 peptides, along with neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These peptides arise from cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by b-amyloid cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1),2 hence inhibitors of this aspartyl protease could have therapeutic benefits for the treatment of AD. In the course of our program to develop patentable novel inhibitors of BACE-1, we investigated conformationally constrained versions of the hydroxyethylamine motif found in many aspartyl protease inhibitors.3 Based on our analysis of the binding mode for the prototypical inhibitor 1 complexed to BACE-1,4,5 we decided to integrate the methylene groups flanking the secondary amine into an azetidine, pyrrolidine, or piperidine ring (2, Fig. 1). Computational modeling of these ring-constrained amines suggested a similar binding mode as for 1, while simultaneously rigidifying the conformational flexibility of the R 0 -side chain. From a retrosynthetic perspective, we considered the stereoselective synthesis of key amino alcohol 3 via two complementary routes (Fig. 2): formation of bond A would require an Evans aldol coupling between an enantiopure Boc-protected prolinal (or piperidine-2-

by reduction of the pyridine moiety to the desired piperidine scaffold. A specific example illustrating the implementation of the Evans aldol route is shown for BACE-1 inhibitor 2f (Scheme 1), but served well for a host of other cyclic amines described in Table 1. The acyloxazolidinone 8 required for the Aldol coupling was prepared in three steps (96% overall yield) from commercially available 3,5-difluorocinnamic acid 6 based on the literature.9 Boc-protected 4-benzyloxyprolinal 9 was generated in five straightforward steps10 from cis-4hydroxy-D -proline, and was subsequently coupled with the boron-enolate derived from 8 in 80% isolated yield. Removal of the oxazolidinone auxiliary from aldol adduct 1011 with lithium hydroperoxide provided a bhydroxy acid, which was exposed to diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA). Upon Curtius-rearrangement, the incipient isocyanate was readily captured by the hydroxyl group to furnish oxazolidinone 11 in 72% yield (two steps).12 Hydrolysis with lithium hydroxide gave the desired amino alcohol 12 in 75% yield, and was subsequently coupled to 5-methyl-N,N-dipropyl-isophthalic acid 134a in the presence of HOBt/EDCI (or HATU/ HOAt). Final deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) furnished BACE-1 inhibitor 2f in 46% (two steps). An alternate route to piperidine-based BACE-1 inhibitors is shown in Scheme 2, exemplified by the synthesis of compound 2q. Addition of (S)-N,N-dibenzyl-3,5difluorophenylalaninal 1413 to 2-lithio-4-chloropyridine (regioselectively formed from 4-chloropyridine 15 and n-butyllithium in the presence of 2-(dimethylamino)

ethanol)14 resulted in selective formation of adduct 16. Treatment with sodium ethoxide afforded intermediate 17, which was subsequently deprotected to the amino alcohol and converted to amide 18. Reduction of the pyridine ring with platinum(IV) oxide/hydrogen in acetic acid gave two isomers 2q and 19, which were separated by silica gel chromatography. The bioactivity of these novel BACE-1 inhibitors was assessed in standard in vitro15 and cellular16 assays, with select results shown in Table 1. The effect of ring size was probed in a series of unsubstituted analogs 2a, 2b, and 2g (R 0 = H, n = 0­2). While the azetidine 2a shows only moderate activity (BACE-1 IC50 = 770 nM, cellular IC50 = 2800 nM), the increased molecular volume of pyrrolidine 2b and piperidine 2g greatly improved in vitro activity (BACE-1 IC50 = 65 nM and 130 nM, respectively). This level of potency compares favorably to the lead inhibitor 1 (BACE-1 IC50 = 8 nM) given that inhibitors 2b and 2g are not garnering binding affinity from the 3methoxybenzyl substitution.

fort to explore the SAR around 4-benzylpiperidine 2i, we evaluated methoxybenzyl analogs 2j­2l, phenethyl derivative 2m, as well as the cyclohexyl (2n) and cyclohexylmethyl (2o) variants. However, reduced in vitro and cellular activity was observed in each case. Finally, we decided to explore the SAR of 4-alkoxypiperidines 2p­2w. Gratifyingly, small alkoxy groups such as ethoxy, butoxy, cyclopropylmethoxy, and methoxyethoxy showed single-digit nanomolar IC50 with good cellular activity (cell IC50 = 106­160 nM). Inspection of the X-ray structure for 4-ethoxypiperidine ° derivative 2q reveals a 2.4 A hydrogen-bond from the Thr72 backbone NH of the enzyme flap to the oxygen atom of the 4-ethoxypiperidine, while the S2 0 pocket remains unoccupied (Fig. 4). Energetically, the favorable interaction of the ether oxygen with the flap NH compensates for the absence of hydrophobic interactions that are harnessed by inhibitors such as 2i with larger substituents in the S2 0 pocket, thus enabling improved cellular activity. By comparison, the 4-benzyloxypyrrolidine 2e cannot establish a similar hydrogenbonding interaction due to its different trajectory into the S2 0 enzyme subsite. BACE-1 inhibitors 2e and 2f were further profiled against a panel of relevant human aspartyl proteases (Table 2). Benzyloxypyrrolidine 2e exhibited low selectivity against cathepsin D (Ki = 36 nM) and cathepsin E (Ki = 5 nM), while the phenoxypyrrolidine 2f was slightly more selective (291 nM and 24 nM, respectively). In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated the potential of novel pyrrolidine- and piperidine-based BACE-1 inhibitors. As conformationally constrained versions of hydroxyethylamine-type peptidomimetics, their cyclic amine core allows for targeted substitution into the S2 0 subsite. In addition, a hydrogen-bonding interaction has been discovered that significantly improved potency for 4-alkoxypiperidines that do not

Moreover, additional potency can be regained through appropriate substitution of the pyrrolidine ring as is evident from 4-substituted pyrrolidines 2c­2f. While 4hydroxy and 4-methoxy analogs 2c and 2d exhibit diminished potency relative to its parent, bulkier 4-benzyloxy or 4-phenoxy groups render 2e (BACE-1 IC50 = 5 nM) and 2f (BACE-1 IC50 = 3 nM) equipotent with lead 1. An overlay of X-ray structures for 1 and 2f (Fig. 3, flap removed for clarity) reveals the expected overlap on the nonprime side (S3 through S1 enzyme subsites) along with the conformational constraint imposed by the pyrrolidine ring.5 As a result, the 4-benzyloxy group accesses a space similar to that occupied by the methoxybenzyl moiety present in inhibitor 1. As for the pyrrolidines, substitution of the piperidine ring can also lead to more potent compounds. While 2h (R = Pr, 70 nM) and 2i (R = Bn, 14 nM) show improved in vitro activity relative to 2g, their increased lipophilicity also reduced the cellular activity. In an ef-
