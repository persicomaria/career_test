ABSTRACT Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) comprise a diverse superfamily of enzymes found in organisms from all kingdoms of life. GSTs are involved in diverse processes, notably small-molecule biosynthesis or detoxification, and are frequently also used in protein engineering studies or as biotechnology tools. Here, we report the highresolution X-ray structure of Atu5508 from the pathogenic soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens (atGST1). Through use of comparative sequence and structural analysis of the GST superfamily, we identified local sequence and structural signatures, which allowed us to distinguish between different GST classes. This approach enables GST classification based on structure, without requiring additional biochemical or immunological data. Consequently, analysis of the atGST1 crystal structure suggests a new GST class, distinct from previously characterized GSTs, which would make it an attractive target for further biochemical studies.

for Structural Genomics (JCSG) database, based on statistically significant sequence similarity detected by PSIBLAST.1 In general, GSTs catalyze the transfer of the tripeptide glutathione (g-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine; GSH) to a cosubstrate that contains a reactive electrophilic centre to form a polar S-glutathionylated reaction product. GSTs comprise a large superfamily of enzymes that are ubiquitous in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. This protein family has been the focus of intensive research not only because of its important biological roles, but also due to its multiple biomedical and biotechnology applications. The multiple roles and applications of GSTs encompass: (1) Major components of small-molecule detoxification pathways in humans, especially for electrophilic compounds that include mutagens, carcinogens, and drugs; (2) Conferral of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and herbicide resistance in plants; (3) Biosynthesis of metabolites; (4) Biotechnology tools, notably used in fusion with other proteins of interest; and (5) Candidates for directed evolution and design of new enzymatic catalysts.2,3 GSTs form a very diverse protein family and, therefore, have been subdivided into an ever-increasing number of subfamilies (referred to here as ``GST classes''), associated with different functionalities and enzymatic properties.4,5 This classification has usually been based on a combination of criteria, such as biochemical properties, primary, tertiary, and quaternary structure and immunological reactivity.3 Here, we report the crystal structure of Atu5508 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens that was determined using the semiautomated high-throughput pipeline of the JCSG.6 Our analysis of the sequence and structure of Atu5508 indicate that it defines a new GST class, distinct from other previously characterized GSTs.

wash buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) and eluted with 3 CV of elute buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 15 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole). The protein-containing fraction was loaded onto a 1 3 10 cm column packed with Poros HQ anion exchange resin and equilibrated in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.25 TCEP. Following a 2 CV wash, the protein was eluted in a 15 CV linear 0­1M NaCl gradient. Pooled fractions were buffer exchanged into crystallization buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM TCEP) and concentrated to 36 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Orbital). The protein was either frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use or used immediately for crystallization trials. The protein was crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method7 with standard JCSG crystallization protocols.6 The crystallization solution contained 18% PEG 3350, 0.2M potassium thiocyanate, and 10% glycerol with an additive of 10 mM spermine tetra-HCL. The cryosolution also contained 10% MPD. The crystals were indexed in monoclinic space group C2 (Table I). Data Collection Anomalous diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (APS, Chicago, USA) on beamline 19-BM at wavelengths corresponding to peak, remote, and inflection (k1, k2, and k3), of a selenium multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiment (Table I). The data sets were collected at 100 K using an APS1 CCD detector. Data were integrated, reduced, and scaled using the HKL2000 suite.10 Data statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure Solution and Refinement ° Phases to 2.5 A resolution were calculated with the CCP4 suite,8 SHELXD,11 and AUTOSHARP12 using 11 Se positions. Automatic model building was performed with RESOLVE13 and ARP/wARP.14 Model completion and refinement were performed using the programs O,15 ° COOT,16 and REFMAC5.8 The final refinement at 2.0 A resolution was performed using the peak data (k1). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure Analysis and Deposition Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the model was accomplished using AutoDepInputTool,17 MolProbity,18 SFcheck 4.0,19 and WHAT IF 5.0.20 The protein quaternary structure was analyzed using the PQS server.21 Figure 1(B) was adapted from a PDBsum22 analysis and all other figures were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors of Atu5508 (gi:15162326) have been deposited in the PDB and are accessible under the code 2fno. Phylogenetic Tree Construction To assess the evolutionary relationship of atGST1 (Atu5508) to other members of the GST superfamily in SCOP, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. We selected a

MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Production and Crystallization A putative glutathione S-transferase, Atu5508 (GI: 15162326, Swissprot: Q8UJG9) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA from A. tumefaciens, using TAQ polymerase and primers corresponding to the predicted 50 - and 30 -ends. The PCR product, representing residues 1­236 of Atu5508 was cloned into plasmid pMH1, which encodes an expression and purification tag (MGSDKIHHHHHH) at the amino terminus of the full-length protein. The cloning junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein expression was performed in selenomethionine-containing medium using the E. coli methionine auxotrophic strain DL41. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM KPO4, pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM imidazole, 0.25 mM TCEP, benzonase, PefaBloc protease inhibitor cocktail). Immediately after sonication, the cell debris was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 158,000g for 60 min (48C). The soluble fraction was applied to a gravity flow metal chelate column (Talon resin charged with cobalt; Clontech) equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was then washed with seven column volumes (CV) of

Graphical representations of the trees were generated using the Treeview software.25 Profile­Profile Alignments Atu5508 (atGST1) was aligned with all other members of the GST superfamily in the SCOP structure database (version 1.65),26 using hybrid profile-profile alignments, as implemented in HMAP.27,28 HMAP uses hybrid multidimensional profile alignment that combines sequence, secondary and tertiary structure to facilitate the detection of remote homologs.

profile alignment) were chosen from the individual families in the SCOP GST superfamily (http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam. ac.uk/scop/data/scop.b.b.fd.b.A.html) and are listed in Table II. In general, the representative structure from each SCOP family with the highest sequence identity to atGST1 was chosen. Multiple-structure superimpositions were performed using the Grasp2 package,29 which combines secondary structure elements (SSEs) superimposition with Ca RMSD minimization. GST class-specific motifs or residues that had been identified in the literature were compared both in the superimposed structures and in the structure-based sequence alignments. Motifs that distinguish between the different classes at the structural level were identified (Table II) and, for each motif, atGST1 was compared with each class to assess similarities and differences.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crystal structure of atGST1 [Fig. 1(A)] was deter° mined at 2.0 A by the MAD method. Data collection, model, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes two monomers in the asymmetric unit. Each monomer contains 236 residues (residue 1 is disordered in chain A and residues 1­3 are disordered in chain B), 4 SCNÀ ions, and 394 water molecules. Electron density also was observed for three residues of the expression/purification tag in chain A (His À2, His À1, and His 0). No electron density was observed for the side chains of His(À2), Ser32, Lys51, Arg67, Arg118, Gln127, Glu160, Lys213, Lys233 in chain A, and residues Asp3, Ser32, Lys51, Arg118, Gln127, Glu160, Lys213, Glu216, Glu217 in chain B. ° The Matthews' coefficient (Vm)30 is 2.61 A3/Da and the estimated solvent content is 52.4%. The Ramachandran plot, produced by MolProbity,18 shows that 98.25%, 99.56%, and 0.44% of the residues are in favored, allowed and disallowed regions, respectively. The only residue in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot corresponds to Gln73 of the A and B monomers, but has unambiguous electron density. The GST monomer consists of four b-strands (b1­b4), ten a-helices (H1­H2, H4­H5, H7­12), and two 310-helices (H3, H6) [Fig. 1(A,B)]. The total b-strand, a-helical, and 310-helical content is 5.9%, 57.3%, and 2.5%, respectively. Similar to other GSTs, atGST1 is composed of two domains: a smaller N-terminal domain (residues 2­85) followed by a short linker region (residues 86­92) and a larger C-terminal domain (residues 93­236) [Fig. 1(A)]. The N-terminal domain belongs to the thioredoxin fold,31,32 while the C-terminal domain belongs to the ``GST-C-terminal domain'' a-helical fold. In most GSTs, the glutathione substrate binds in the socalled ``G-site'', while the electrophilic cosubstrate that becomes covalently conjugated to the glutathione binds in the usually hydrophobic ``H-site''. As the two binding sites are in the dimer interface, many of the features of this interface are inevitably related to the binding and catalytic properties of GSTs. Analysis of the crystallographic packing of Atu5508 using the PQS server21 identified a crystallographic dimer, for

which a significant portion of the interface is formed by interactions of a-helices H3­H4 and two short loop regions. ° This interface buries a surface area of 1900 A2 upon complex formation [Fig. 2(B)]. Comparison of this interface with other biologically relevant GST dimers [e.g. PDB 6gsv, Fig. 2(A)] indicates that this crystallographic dimer is the biologically relevant oligomeric form. The interaction of the socalled ``key'' (Phe56), after rotation of this side-chain to the position seen in 6gsv [Fig. 2(A)], would result in its interaction with the patch of hydrophobic residues in the adjacent monomer (the ``lock'') and further extend this dimer interface. The asymmetric unit itself contains two distinct monomers that interact through a-helices H9­H10 and two short loop regions. This second noncrystallographic interface fea° tures a much smaller buried surface area of 358 A2 per monomer and is, therefore, less likely to be biologically relevant. A search using the DALI server33 found structural similarities to members from different GST classes. The top hit was pi GST (PDB: 1pgt, Z ¼ 20.7) with an RMSD ° of 2.6 A for this structural alignment of 204 residues (Ca atoms) with 19% sequence identity. Other high scoring DALI hits include sigma GST (PDB 1pd2, Z ¼ 18.3), phi GST (PDB 1hqo, Z ¼ 17.6) and beta GST (PDB 1b8x, Z ¼ 16.8). Significant structural similarities to proteins from other GST classes (tau, omega, zeta, theta) are also among the high scoring hits (Z > 9). Although atGST1 can be reliably classified as a GST based on sequence analysis, neither the sequence nor the structure searches found a homolog with a sequence identity of >20%. It is generally accepted that GSTs with <30% sequence identity are assigned to a separate class.3 However, in the absence of any biochemical data, it was not clear whether atGST1 could be classified into any of the already defined GSTs classes or whether it should define a new class based on sequence comparison alone. Compared with its distant homologs, atGST1 seemed to have some features of the alpha class and the malaria parasite pfGST, but lacks some of the defining features of each of these. These observations were corroborated by phylogenetic analysis [Fig. 3(A,B)], which indicate that atGST1 forms a new branch, not grouped within any GST families (as classified by SCOP), indicating divergence from previously characterized GST classes. It should be noted, however, that the bootstrap value for the node separating atGST1 from the neighboring branches (containing GSTs from the alpha, mu, pi, and sigma families) was 635 out of 1000 trials, with even lower values elsewhere in the tree, indicating that the significance of this separation is low. The bootstrap value increased to 735 out of 1000 trials, if only the N-terminal domain of these proteins (that are usually less divergent between classes and, therefore, can be more reliably aligned) were used in the alignment. We then analyzed representative structures of the different GST classes using profile-based methods and multiple-structure alignments. Together with the extensive literature available on GSTs, we identified local strucDOI 10.1002/prot

The key motif (with a tyrosine substituting for the phenylalanine) is present in the Pi class, according to the literature, but its dimer interface is different than in the other GST classes. However, it cannot be visualized in 1bay because of missing residues. The corresponding residue in PDB id 13gs (another representative of the same family) is Y49. c The SNAIL/TRAIL motif is present in most GSTs and contributes polar functional groups to the glutathione (G) binding site, located in the dimer interface.

tural signatures that define each class, most of which consist of single residues or short, but not necessarily contiguous, structural motifs (Fig. 4 and Table II). By combining these characteristics, we could differentiate the previously characterized GST classes from one another based only on the presence or absence of these motifs. These structural signatures have corresponding functional significances, such as differences in catalytic properties or selective dimer formation only between members of a specific GST class. These motifs, detailed in Table II and shown in Figure 4, include (i) a tyrosine (Tyr12 in atGST1) in the N-terminal domain that is a conserved catalytic residue in several GST classes,34 (ii) the l-loop (not present in atGST1), (iii) the hydrophobic ``lock-and-key'' motif, (iv) the SNAIL/TRAIL motif

(not present in atGST1), (v) a catalytic aspartic acid at the beginning of the C-terminal domain, (vi) a catalytic histidine (not present in atGST1) and (vii) a divergent C-terminal region, which in some classes assumes an ahelical conformation. A conserved cis-proline35 found in all representative GSTs, is similarly conserved as Pro60 in atGST1. Although Agrobacterium is pathogenic to plants, atGST1 is not closely related to GSTs in other bacterial or plant organisms in which GSTs of the pi, sigma, phi, and beta class are found. Comparison of the class-specific motifs of the various GST classes revealed that atGST1 is different from all of these classes. For example, comparison with beta (bacterial) GSTs showed that catalytic residues conserved in this class (Cys10 and

proteins; pfGST contains a variation of the ``SNAIL motif '', has a short ``mu loop'', and a putative catalytic histidine in position 107, all of which are not present in atGST1. Quite a few of the class-specific motifs are located in the GST dimer interface. Dimerization is essential for stability and function,37 and therefore, analysis of the dimer interface is crucial in understanding GST function and specificity. One such feature, generally considered important for dimerization, is the hydrophobic ``lockand-key'' motif [Figs 2(A) and 4]. This motif is conserved in alpha, mu, and pi GSTs3 and in pfGST. The ``key'' is an aromatic residue in one monomer and the ``lock'' is a cluster of hydrophobic residues from the other interacting subunit. atGST1 seems to have this conserved feature (Phe56 corresponds to the ``key'' residue) in the appropriate structural location, but the aromatic sidechain points away from the dimeric interface, possibly because of the absence of bound ligands [Fig. 2(A)]. This observation is consistent with previous investigations of hGST-A1-1, a member of the alpha class, where dimer formation was still maintained after mutations of this aromatic residue to a serine, but its catalytic function and dimer stability were severely reduced.38,39 As indicated previously, Gln73 from both the A and B chains lies in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Interestingly, a structural alignment of the best scoring DALI hit (1pgt) reveals that this glutamine

(Gln64 in the 1pgt structure) is oriented toward the substrate cavity, within hydrogen bonding distance to the substrate. The glutamine side-chain adopts a similar orientation in our structure. Similar side-chain orientations are observed in the structures from the pi, mu, alpha, sigma, and pfGST classes, suggesting a conserved functional role of Gln73 in substrate binding. Almost all of the structural motifs analyzed above are functional determinants of atGST1, namely they play a significant role in catalytic function and substrate specificity. In the N-terminal domain, the complement of functional motifs that enable glutathione binding and catalysis4 are indeed present in atGST1 (Table II), including the conserved cis-proline (Pro60), the catalytic N-terminal tyrosine (Tyr12), and the hydrophobic ``key'' (Phe56). The higher conservation of the N-terminal domain and the presence of these functional motifs affirm the functionality of glutathione binding in the G site. Indeed, after testing the GST function of atGST1 using a standard functional GST assay (35­141 lg of protein, 258C, as described in Habig and Jakoby40) with GSH and p-nitrobenzyl chloride, we measured a specific activity of 0.22 Æ 0.03 lmol/min/mg. Interestingly, the presence of both the N-terminal tyrosine and the lock-and-key motifs is the hallmark of the alpha, mu, pi, and pfGST classes (which are found in mammals or in mammalian parasites). The lock-and-key motif is not characteristic of previously described bacteDOI 10.1002/prot

rial or plant GSTs. Moreover, an arginine residue (Arg18) is present in atGST1 in the same location and orientation as the catalytic arginine that coordinates the glutathione sulfur in the alpha class.4,41 This suggests that the catalytic mechanism for nucleophilic activation of glutathione in atGST1 is similar to that of alpha GSTs. Notably, pfGST has a lysine residue, which is important for catalysis,42 at the position corresponding to the catalytic arginine.36 On the other hand, the C-terminal domain of atGST1 diverges significantly from other GSTs, suggesting differences in the substrate specificity of the H site.3,4,41 In particular, the extreme C-terminal region of atGST1 (residues 214­236), which is dissimilar in sequence and conformation to the corresponding regions of other GSTs, deserves further consideration (Fig. 4, forest green, motif VII). A corresponding (but divergent) C-terminal helix (a9) in the alpha family plays a role in the catalytic cycle and confers distinctive substrate specificity.4,40,43­45 The positioning of this C-terminal helix, which is located near the H site, alters the size of the substrate-binding pocket and, therefore, influences the specificity for the electrophilic substrate. In atGST1, the C-terminal region is longer than in most GSTs and adopts a distinctive loop-helix (H12) structure, suggesting unique catalytic properties and perhaps specific substrate recognition. Indeed, atGST1 catalyzes the conjugation of GSH to p-nitrobenzyl chloride, as do many other GSTs.40 However, no GST activity was detected with the following substrates: 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, p-nitrophenethyl bromide, and trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-21. Thus, the structural and functional characterization of atGST1 presented here should help direct further studies of the catalytic properties and electrophilic substrate specificity of this novel GST. In conclusion, we have combined various structural motifs identified in the known GST classes that enable us to classify GSTs at the structural level, without requiring additional biochemical or immunological results. By comparing the structural similarities and differences of atGST1 to other GSTs (as detailed in Table II), we conclude that the atGST1 structure represents a novel GST class, distinct from previously defined GST classes. Surprisingly, the catalytically relevant structural motifs of atGST1 show a closer evolutionary relationship to mammalian GSTs than to previously characterized bacterial or plant GSTs. Its distinctiveness, therefore, makes atGST1 an attractive target for further biochemical studies that will aid in a better understanding of the evolution of GSTs. In particular, the substantial differences between its active site and those of plant GSTs suggest that atGST1 may be a promising target for designing specific inhibitors against A. tumefaciens. Interestingly, we found several close homologs of atGST1 in the set of environmental sequences determined recently by the environmental sequencing project carried out by the Craig Venter Institute (https://research.venterinstitute.org/ moore). Therefore, it is clear that atGST1 is not a single member of this branch--this structure likely represents a larger family, which will grow as the existing sequence
