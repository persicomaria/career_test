DntR is a bacterial transcription factor that has been isolated from Burkholderia species that are able to degrade the nitro-aromatic compound 2,4-dinitrotoluene. We recently solved the X-ray crystal structure of DntR, which suggested a putative location of an inducer-binding cavity (IBC). In this study, we constructed mutants of DntR in which residues lining the proposed IBC were modified in order to identify the structural elements involved in inducer binding, to modulate the inducer binding specificity, and to investigate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by DntR. The transcriptional activation of the reporter gene gfp induced by the wild-type and mutant DntRs was monitored by analysing whole-cell fluorescence using flow-cytometry after addition of a number of potential inducer compounds. Three of the mutant proteins (F111L; F111V/H169V and Y110S/ F111V) were purified and the binding constants for several of the potential inducers to these mutants were estimated. Furthermore, crystal structures of the F111L and Y110S/F111V mutant proteins were solved and used to explain changes in the inducer binding specificity at an atomic level. A comparison of the inducing capability in the whole-cell system and binding constants for a number of potential inducers suggests a mechanism where binding of an inducer molecule is not the sole requirement for transcriptional activation. In addition, specific interactions between DntR and the inducer molecule resulting in a conformational change of the protein are needed.

Introduction
The industrial production of organic compounds has introduced a vast number of substances that previously did not occur in Nature. These compounds, called xenobiotics, are often resistant to environmental degradation and have no physiological function in any organism. In cases where no pathway for complete degradation of the xenobiotic compounds has evolved, many of them can be

partly degraded in dead-end reactions that often result in substances that are more toxic than the original compounds. Very few nitro-substituted compounds occurred in Nature before synthetic nitroarenes were produced. These nitro-substituted aromatic compounds are typically highly mutagenic, since the nitro-group can be reduced by most organisms to yield highly reactive species.1 In recent years, several degradation pathways have been found in bacteria that are able to completely degrade nitroarenes and thus remove them from the environment.2­6 A degradation pathway for the complete mineralization of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) was found in Burkholderia sp. strain DNT7,8 and in Burkholderia cepacia R349,10 bacteria isolated from soil and water heavily contaminated by 2,4-DNT. In both strains, the transcriptional regulatory protein DntR was found to regulate the expression of enzymes that catalyze the first steps in the oxidative degradation

573 aromatic compounds with structural similarities to salicylate and 2,4-DNT could act as inducers. For this purpose, a whole-cell sensor was constructed holding plasmids harboring the dntR gene and gfp reporter gene,22 where the gfp gene was under the control of the PDNT promoter. Several of the mutant DntR proteins were purified and their potential inducer molecule binding specificities determined and compared to results from flow-cytometric analysis of the whole-cell sensor. Additionally, the crystal structures of two of the mutant DntRs were determined. The results described here provide insights into the structure and regulating mechanism of the transcriptional regulator DntR.

of 2,4-DNT.8,10 The dntR gene that is used in the present study was isolated from the Burkholderia sp. strain DNT, which differs from the variant isolated from B. cepacia R34 at one amino acid residue (T112/ S112). DntR is a member of the large family of LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs). These transcription factors usually require binding of small molecules (inducers) to activate the transcription of genes downstream of the promoter. Typically, the inducers are metabolic intermediates in the degradation pathway regulated by the transcription factor. Common to all LTTRs is a primary structure of approximately 300 amino acid residues, a C-terminal inducer-binding domain (IBD) and a DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal containing a helix-turn-helix motif.11 Results from mutagenesis studies of LTTRs have shown that the IBD consists of two regions located approximately between residues 95 and 173, and between residues 196 and 206, that are involved in inducer recognition, and one region between residues 227 and 253 that is thought to be involved in multimerization.12 Different members of the LysR family are involved in the regulation of a diverse number of different degradation pathways.11 One subgroup of the LysR family consists of transcriptional regulators of pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds. Many of these regulate catabolism of cathecol derivatives and are induced by cis,cis-muconate or its derivatives,12 while NahR,13 NtdR,14 NagR,15 and DntR16,17 are induced by salicylate. These regulators have high levels of sequence similarity where DntR displays 61%, 97% and 99% sequence identity with NahR, NtdR and NagR, respectively.14 Structures have been determined for only a few LTTRs; CysB (truncated),18 Cbl (truncated),19 OxyR (truncated)20 and CbnR.21 We recently determined the crystal structures of DntR with thiocyanate (dmin = 2.3 Å) and acetate (dmin = 2.6 Å) in a putative IBC.17 Like CbnR,21 DntR was found to be a dimer of dimers, where each dimer consists of two monomers arranged in a head-to-tail orientation. A head-tohead orientation of two such dimers was observed in the physiologically relevant homotetramer seen in the crystals.17 In DntR, the proposed IBC was located at the interface of the two sub-domains in the IBD of each monomer (Figure 1(a)). Using the positions of the acetate ions in one of our crystal structures as markers, salicylate was positioned into the proposed IBC and a structure model of the IBC with the inducer bound was produced. In the salicylate-DntR model, the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of salicylate form direct hydrogen bonds to side-chain atoms of T104, H169 and H206 and the main-chain carbonyl group of L151, respectively. Its aromatic ring is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with the sidechains of Y110, F111, F167, I106 and I273.17 On the basis of the results of our structural studies, we have constructed a number of DntR mutants in order to identify the structural elements of the proposed IBC that are involved in inducer binding. Furthermore, we investigated whether a number of

Results
Construction of a two-plasmid system to analyze the inducer specificities of mutant DntRs In earlier studies, transcriptional activation by DntR was monitored in the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 harboring the plasmid pLCN60.9. 16 The plasmid pLCN60.9 holds the promoter PDNT, the dntR gene (upstream) and the reporter gene gfp (downstream) under control of this promoter. In this study, a two-vector system with Escherichia coli DH5 as a host was constructed and used to analyze transcriptional activation by mutated DntR variants after addition of different potential inducer compounds. The PDNT promoter and the gfp gene22 downstream of this promoter were inserted into the plasmid pREP4, resulting in the plasmid named pREPp-gfp. The dntR gene with a C-terminal His6 tag was situated on the expression plasmid pQE60 under the control of the T5/lac promoter (see Supplementary Data Figure 1). An advantage of using the two-plasmid system is that it allows the usage of the same pQE60-based construct for site-directed mutagenesis, expression of the DntR protein and analysis of its regulatory activity. There are two major differences for DntR in pQE60 compared to the pLCN60.9-based construct: (i) the DntR protein has a C-terminal His6 tag; (ii) DntR autorepression, which is typical for LTTRs is disabled.11 Results from the flow-cytometric analyses of wholecell fluorescence demonstrated that these differences do not influence the ability of wild-type (WT) DntR to activate transcription of the gfp gene (Figure 2(a),(b)). The fold of induction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression after the addition of salicylate were comparable for P. putida KT2440 harboring the plasmid pLCN60.9, E. coli DH5 harboring pLCN60.9 and E. coli DH5 harboring the twoplasmid system (Figure 2). The background fluorescence was much higher in P. putida than in E. coli, and the level of induction (measured as the fluorescence intensity ratio of induced/uninduced cells) was noticeably higher in E. coli (Figure 2(a)). The biphasic nature of the peaks after addition of an inducing compound after 15 h cultivation (dif-

ferent from 4 h cultivation where single peaks were observed) (Figure 2(b)­(d)) is presumably due to filamentous cell growth caused by a too high metabolic load when both DntR and GFP over-expression is induced (as observed from an increase in side scattering after addition of an inducing compound (data not shown), which implies a larger cell size). The repressing function of WT and mutant DntRs in the absence of an inducer In the absence of the inducer salicylate, E. coli DH5 cells harboring only the pREPp-gfp vector (mean fluorescence 23) and also cells harboring the twovector system without IPTG added (mean fluorescence 22) (where no visible expression of DntR occurs as shown with SDS-PAGE/Western blot, data not shown) demonstrated about fourfold higher fluorescence intensity than E. coli DH5 cells harbouring the pLCN60.9 plasmid (mean fluorescence 5) (where a constitutive expression of DntR occurs) after 4 h expression. This higher GFP fluorescence in the absence of DntR suggests that WT DntR has a repressive effect when bound to the promoter in the

absence of an inducer. However, after expression of DntR for 15 h, the repressing effect of WT DntR was not as prominent in the two-vector system anymore (expressed as the ratio of fluorescence between induced and non-induced cells in Table 1). Compared to WT DntR, several mutants, for example F111L/ H169V and Y110S/F111V, seem to display a stronger repressing effect (Figure 2(c) and (d) and Table 1). Analysis of the inducer response in whole cells A number of structural variants with mutations in the proposed IBC were constructed and their salicylate-induced response was investigated (Table 1). In order to analyze the inducer specificity of these DntR mutants, a number of aromatic compounds (potential inducers) were added to cultures of E. coli DH5 expressing the different DntR variants. The responses to these potential inducers for some DntR variants where a significant change in the inducer specificity was obtained are given in Table 2. For all mutants tested in this study, except for F167H, the response to salicylate was lower than for the WT protein (Table 1). Mutation of H169, pos-

575 Of the eight potential inducers tested (Tables 1 and 2), only salicylate had a clear inducing effect on the cells expressing WT DntR. However, for several of the mutant DntRs investigated, the inducer response was broadened. A newly acquired response to benzoate was observed for the H169V, F111L, F167H (not shown), Y110S/F111Vand Y110S/F111L (not shown) mutants, while the introduction of a F111L/H169V double mutation resulted in a further broadening of inducer response of DntR, where addition of salicylate, benzoate, 4-nitrobenzoate and, to a small extent, 2,4-DNT all resulted in a transcriptional response. Similar results were observed for the F111L/ H169N double mutant, although the response was much lower for all compounds tested (not shown). Several mutants, including all the triple mutants shown in Table 1 and the double mutants F111L/ L151T and F111V/L151T did not respond to any of the compounds tested. According to SDS PAGE/ Western blot data (not shown), the expression levels of these DntR mutants were lower than that of the WT DntR, which may explain the absence of the response to the inducer. However, even with these low levels of expression, the repressive effect of these mutant DntRs without the inducer was observed (see the effect of IPTG in Table 1). Thus, it is likely that these mutant DntRs, although able to bind to the promoter region, are either not able to bind any of the inducer molecules tested or they are not able to undergo the necessary conformational change. Thus, the transcription cannot be activated. Effect of nitro-aromatic compounds on the salicylate-induced transcription in whole cells We observed that addition of 4-nitrotoluene (4NT) to cell cultures expressing WT DntR resulted in lower cell fluorescence than in the absence of any compound (see Table 2). This led us to investigate whether certain compounds, although not active as inducers, can compete with salicylate for the IBC in the whole-cell system. The effect of several nitroaromatics on the salicylate-induced transcription of GFP in cells harboring the wild-type DntR gene was

+IPTG/-IPTG is the ratio between the mean fluorescence intensities (FI) for cells with addition of 1 mM IPTG and the mean FI without IPTG. Fold of induction is measured as the mean FI after addition of 1 mM IPTG and 500 M salicylate divided by the mean FI for cells with addition of 1 mM IPTG and only solvent (DMSO). In all cases, data were collected for 10,000 E. coli DH5 cells harboring the pQE60 vector with the DntR variant and the pREPp-gfp plasmid. All samples were analyzed 16 h after addition of IPTG. All mutants in this Table were analyzed with all putative inducers once, and for the mutants where a change in inducer specificity was observed (fold of induction N1.5), the analyses were repeated. These results are given in Table 2.

tulated to be involved in H-bonding interactions with the carboxy-group of salicylate17 caused a noticeable decrease in response. Of all the single mutations, F111L caused the most prominent loss of salicylate-induced response. The residue F111 is part of a hydrophobic wall of the IBC that presumably interacts with the salicylate aromatic ring and does not participate in hydrogen bonding. However, introduction of this mutation brings about an unexpectedly large change in the position of H206, the residue, which is modeled to be involved in hydrogen bonding of the salicylate carboxy-group (see the comparison of the structures of WT, Y110S/ F111V and F111L mutant DntRs below) and stabilization of the head-to-tail interface in the DntR homo-dimer.

576 analyzed by adding a nitro-aromatic compound in combination with salicylate to the cell cultures. The response was then compared to the response in a cell culture where only salicylate was added. Addition of 4-NT and 2,4-DNT clearly decreased the wholecell fluorescence, while only a small effect was observed for benzoate (Figure 3). Inducer binding to WT and mutant DntR proteins Intrinsic fluorescence of proteins originates mainly from tryptophan and, to some extent, from tyrosine residues. This fluorescence is sensitive to the environment of the aromatic side chain and can change upon ligand binding to an apo-protein,23,24 DntR contains two Trp and five Tyr residues. According to our structural models, the two Trp residues are relatively close to the IBC (about 20 Å) and Tyr110 is involved directly in salicylate binding (Figure 1). For WT DntR, fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for sodium salicylate, which was estimated to be 4­5 M (see also Figure 4(a)).17 The same approach was used to estimate the salicylate dissociation constants for the mutant DntRs F111L/H169V and F111L; in both cases, the Kd values (7.0(±1.7) and 8.1(±0.5) M, respectively, see Table 3) were in the same range as for the WT DntR (the titration curves for F111L/H169V and WT are shown in Figure 4(a)). The mutant Y110S/F111V displayed a different titration course comprised of a small contribution of a high-affinity site with a Kd value of 2 M and a contribution of unspecific salicylate binding (Figure 4(a)). For WT DntR, similar titration curves were obtained for benzoate and salicylate, with Kd values slightly higher for benzoate (Table 3; Figure 4(a) and (b)). This observation is consistent with the similar structures of benzoate and salicylate, the former

The concentration of DntR was between 1.5 M and 2.5 M; the exact concentration was taken into account for Kd approximation using equation (1). The errors were estimated from the fits to the data sets shown in the Figure. These data sets are representative titrations. The average values derived from the several titrations are given in Table 3. The incubation medium was 50 mM NaH2PO4­NaOH (pH 8.0), 0.1 M Na2SO4, 17% (v/v) glycerol. 2,4-DNT was dissolved in DMSO and the data were corrected for the effect of this solvent on the fluorescence.

being only one hydroxy-group smaller. However, this observation is not consistent with the flowcytometric data for the whole cells displaying no significant response to benzoate (Table 2), which is discussed below. The Kd values for benzoate estimated for the F111L/H169V and Y110S/F111V mutant DntRs (Figure 4(b)) were slightly higher than for the WT protein (see Table 3) although the response of these

577 of the IBC coupled with side-chain movements of L151, F167 and H169 side-chains observed suggests no improvement in the binding of 2,4-DNT to DntR, an observation borne out by experiment (Table 2 and see Inducer binding to WT and mutant DntR proteins). In contrast, in the crystal structure of the single F111L mutant (Figure 1(b)) the positions of the residues (Y110, H167, and R248) in the hydrophobic part of the IBC do not move significantly and the F111L mutation results in a larger hydrophobic environment in which the methyl group of 2,4-DNT might be accommodated. However, H169 moves considerably, while H206 flips its rotamer and its imidazole ring occupies a small cavity close to the IBC. This cavity is seen, but is unoccupied, in the structures of WT DntRs. These unexpected movements of H169 and H206 added to the F111L mutation results in a considerable enlargement of the IBC of DntR and in this mutant crystal structure a network of water molecules occupies the extra space and connects the thiocyanate to the hydroxyl group of Y171 and main chain atoms of G205 and H206 (Figure 1(b), bottom). This flipping of the H206 sidechain might not occur in the IBCs structures of all mutant DntRs without ligand binding. However,

The titrations of the protein intrinsic fluorescence of the wild-type and mutant DntR were carried out as shown in Figure 4, and the Kd values were estimated using equation (1), except for the Y110S/ F111V mutant, where equation (2) was used for determination of Kd for the high-affinity binding. In this case, the titration curve primarily displayed the contribution from unspecific binding (see Figure 4). The data from 2­7 titrations were averaged.

mutants to benzoate in the whole-cell system were much more prominent than for the WT DntR (Table 2). According to our model predictions,17 2,4-DNT is expected to fit well into the enlarged IBC of the Y110S/F111V and F111L/H169V double mutant DntRs. However, the titration curves for all the mutants investigated demonstrated only unspecific binding of this dinitro-compound, similar to the binding to the WT protein (data not shown). These data are in agreement with the absence (WT and Y110S/F111V) or a very low level of (F111L/H169V) induction by 2,4-DNT in the whole-cell system (Table 2). Comparison of the structures of WT, Y110S/F111V and F111L mutant DntRs To complement the work described thus far, two of the mutant DntRs, F111L and Y110S/F111V were crystallized and their structures were both determined to 2.2 Å resolution (see Table 4). Both structures contain thiocyanate ions in the IBC. For these two mutant DntRs, of all the potential inducers investigated, only salicylate and benzoate had inducing effects in the whole-cell system (see Table 2). Both mutant structures are almost identical with those of the WT DntR (r.m.s. deviations in C positions are 0.42 Å and 0.32 Å, respectively). However, the mutant structures differ from those of WT DntR in several crucial details. Surprisingly, the Y110S/F111V double mutant does not lead to an enlarged IBC in comparison with that of WT DntR. In this mutant DntR structure (Figure 1(b)), the side-chain of L151 adopts a different rotamer than it does in the WT structure and there is a movement of F167 into the IBC to occupy some of the missing space resulting from the mutation of F111. The Y110S mutation allows the side-chain of R248 to adopt a different rotamer, which is stabilised by both the stacking of its guanidium group against the benzene ring of F167 and the formation of a hydrogen bond with O of the newly introduced S110. This movement of the side-chain of R248 has a knock-on effect that results in a movement of H169 in comparison to the WT DntR structure. In contrast to our findings,17 DntR was previously suggested to bind 2,4-DNT (see Discussion). In the Y110S/F111V mutant DntR the reduction in the size

578 flipping of the side-chain upon binding of larger ligands would provide a larger IBC, provide a better environment for 2,4-DNT and be less favourable to the binding of salicylate (its carboxyl group can no longer interact with H206). The F111L mutant structure, which in theory should be able to accommodate the methyl group of 2,4-DNT, may therefore serve as a starting point for a new set of mutants to improve the binding of 2,4-DNT to DntR. The ability to accommodate the methyl group of 2,4-DNT seems to be maintained in the F111L/H169V double mutant.

first steps of 2,4-DNT degradation, so that after some time of incubation the slowly increasing amounts of enzymes present degraded enough 2,4DNT for the cells to multiply. This is in agreement with our observation that WT DntR does not seem to completely repress the transcription of the gene downstream of the promoter in the absence of the inducer, in contrast to several of the mutant DntRs, which are able to repress transcription better. Effects of mutations; verification of the IBC and changes in inducer specificity related to structural information As a result of our previous work, a model for the specific binding of salicylate in the IBC of DntR was proposed.17 Removal of His residues postulated to be involved in hydrogen bonding to the carboxy group of salicylate was expected to weaken its interaction with the IBC. This work has shown that the salicylate-induced fluorescence of the whole cells was decreased for all the mutants with a mutation at H169 (see Table 1). An even more drastic effect on the salicylate-induced response was caused by removal of H206 from the IBC, which is shown to occur in the F111L mutant (see Comparison of the structures of WT Y110S/F111V and F111L mutant DntRs). However, for the F111L/H169V mutant, which was expected to combine the weakened salicylate binding caused by each of the two separate mutations, a much higher salicylate-induced response was observed compared to the single F111L mutant. This shows that, at least in some cases, the effects of the mutations are not additive. The results from the flow cytometric analyses (see Table 2) demonstrate that only for the F111L/H169V double mutant does 2,4-DNT have a certain inducing effect. However, this double mutant still maintained a rather high response to salicylic acid. According to the flow-cytometric analysis, it responded to two other compounds containing a carboxy-group, 4-nitrobenzoic acid and benzoic acid, although no response was detected for 2nitrobenzoic acid. The data suggest that the IBC retained the ability to bind the carboxy group, but there seems to be steric hindrance for a nitro group in the ortho position, although not to the same extent for a nitro group in the para-position. On condition that the flipping of the side-chain of H206 observed in the structure of the F111L mutant is adopted in the complex of the F111L/H169V double mutant with 2,4-DNT, one nitro group could interact with the side-chain of the different rotamer of T104, while the other could occupy the space vacated as a result of the side-chain movement of H206. Here, it could interact with the side-chain hydroxyl group of Y171 and the main-chain amide of H206. In this context it is worth noting that NtdR from nitroarene-degrading strains of Acidovorax sp. shows a broader specificity than DntR, and responds to some nitroarenes.14 NtdR differs from DntR by five amino acid substitutions (I74V; H169L; K189R; P227S, and I232V) where the H169L

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate the structure­function relationships of the DntR transcriptional regulator and to modulate its inducer specificity in order to reveal the location of the IBC. We introduced a number of mutations of the residues lining the proposed pocket and the binding of a number of possible inducers was investigated. The evolutionary background of the inducer specificity of DntR Although DntR originated in Burkholderia species that are able to degrade 2,4-DNT,7­10 our earlier results showed that there was no specific binding of 2,4-DNT to the protein.17 The results from this study also confirm that, in the whole-cell biosensor, 2,4DNT is not able to act as an inducer for GFP expression in vivo. Salicylate acts as an inducer of DntR, although it is not an intermediate of the 2,4-DNT degradation pathway in the bacteria in which DntR was discovered.10 Salicylate is also an inducer for the LysR-type proteins NahR and NagR, and here salicylate is a metabolite in the pathways controlled by NahR and NagR. NahR, with 61% amino acid sequence homology to DntR, regulates transcription of enzymes needed in the degradation pathway of naphthalene via salicylate.25 NagR, which differs from DntR by only two amino acid residues, regulates transcription of enzymes for naphthalene degradation via salicylate and gentizate pathways.26 It is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective that salicylate is a "non-metabolic" inducer of DntR, because 2,4-DNT was released into the environment rather recently, and the ability to degrade 2,4-DNT must be a newly acquired property. As a consequence, the regulation of the catabolic operon might not be fully functional. Indeed, there are remnants of inactive salicylate hydroxylase genes found in all operons that encode nitroarene dioxygenases, indicating recent divergence from a common ancestor.27 In addition, a long and irregular acclimatisation period was observed for Burkholderia sp. strain DNT under growth conditions using 2,4-DNT as a sole source of carbon.8 One explanation for this long acclimatisation period could be that there was "leaky" expression of the enzymes needed for the

In Vivo and In Vitro Investigation of DntR

579 The lower fold of induction for the F111L mutant can probably be explained by the flipping of H206 from its position in the IBC (see Figure 1(b)). H206 is the only residue of the RD2 domain interacting specifically with the inducer molecule (see Figure 1(a)). This residue participates in the stabilization of the structural elements of the head-to-tail interface in the dimer, so the removal of H206 might preclude the proper conformational change upon binding of salicylate. Furthermore, addition of 4-NT and 2,4-DNT to the cell cultures grown in the presence of salicylate resulted in much lower levels of fluorescence as compared to cells that were grown only with salicylate. This result suggests that these compounds specifically or non-specifically inhibit salicylate from binding to the IBC, and thereby DntR stays in a conformation that does not activate transcription. The crystal structures obtained so far for the DntR variants all have the IBC occupied with either acetate or thiocyanate; we have not been able to obtain a structure with an empty binding pocket. The presence of different conformations depending on the inducer bound is supported by the observations that salicylate impairs the DntR crystal formation (I. S. et al., unpublished results). Similar observations were described for crystallization of effector-binding domains of BenM, another LysR family member.31 Collectively, the results discussed above indicate that binding of a compound in the IBC does not necessarily result in transcriptional activation. In other words, binding of a compound to the IBC is necessary but not sufficient for the transcriptional activation. Thus, the mechanism underlying the inducer specificity involves at least one more component in addition to the inducer binding, which implies that specific inducer-dependent conformational changes are involved in the transcriptional activation. In this context, it is interesting to note that the Kd values for the different mutant proteins for both salicylate and benzoate differed by only a factor of 3. The results from our study indicate that inducer binding is a result of hydrophobic interactions as well as formation of specific hydrogen bonds, where the latter are required for the structural changes initiating transcription. Some inducers form no or only a few hydrogen bonds, while in other cases a larger number of specific hydrogen bonds are formed. Even though binding may be stronger in the latter case, linkage to an endergonic structural change of the protein may result in an overall lowered binding constant, similar to that measured with an inducer that forms fewer hydrogen bonds. Our continued research is aimed at unraveling the nature of these conformational changes.

mutation is similar to the H169V subsitution in the F111L/H169V double mutant of DntR. These observations clearly point to the importance of residue 169 in determining inducer recognition. It is remarkable that all mutations given in Table 2 resulted in an increase in the whole-cell response to benzoate, showing that all these mutations result in a loss of specificity for salicylate. An increased sensitivity for benzoate was observed also in the case of NahR, which regulates naphthalene degradation in Pseudomonas strains carrying the NAH7 plasmid.28 NahR has Asn at the position corresponding to His169 in DntR. For NahR, which is also induced by salicylate, replacements of this Asn to Asp resulted in a variant with increased sensitivity for benzoate.29,30 This observation is consistent with our results showing that replacement of His169 with Val or Leu increased the sensitivity for benzoate in DntR. In conclusion, mutations of the residues lining the proposed IBC of DntR have a large effect on inducer specificity, showing that the originally proposed location of the IBC was correct.17 Relationship between the dissociation constant and the whole-cell response It is known for the LysR family of transcriptional regulators that the transcriptional activation occurs when an inducer molecule binds to the regulator protein­DNA complex and, as a consequence, conformational changes result in relaxation of DNA bending.12 This conformational change is thought to occur when the inducer binds to the transcriptional regulator and, until now, this binding was supposed to define the inducer specificity. For 2,4-DNT, we could observe a direct relation between the absence of a high-affinity binding for WT and all the mutants investigated, and the absence (or a small number in the case of the F1111L/H169V mutant) of a response in the whole-cell system. However, for salicylate there was no straightforward relation, and we observed a clear discrepancy for benzoate. A low level of specific binding of salicylate correlated to a decrease of the whole-cell response in the case of the Y110S/F111V mutant (Table 2 and Figure 4(a)). For the F111L mutant, the correlation seems to be weaker; the Kd value increased slightly (Table 3) but the whole-cell response decreased to approximately 30% of the WT level. High-affinity binding of benzoate to the wild-type DntR gives almost no induction in the whole-cell system. These data suggest that the inducer can bind to the DntR, but that binding does not result in the "correct" conformational change of DntR and, consequently, no DNA-bend relaxation. In the case of the two double mutants Y110S/F111V and F111L/H169V, which also bind benzoate with high affinity (although lower than that for WT DntR), a prominent enhancement of induction was observed in the presence of the molecule, which indicates that binding of benzoate to these mutants brought about the correct conformational change needed for transcriptional activation.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents Salicylic acid, 2-nitrotoluene, 2-nitrobenzoic acid, 2,4dinitrotoluene and 2-hydroxytoluene (o-cresol) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

580
Benzoic acid, 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-nitrotoluene were purchased from VWR International. For the flowcytometric analysis, 500 mM stock solutions of each compound were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), except for 4-nitrobenzoate, where a 250 mM stock solution was prepared due to the low level of solubility. For the experiments with the intrinsic fluorescence quenching titrations water stock solutions of sodium salicylate and sodium benzoate were used and 2,4-DNT was dissolved in DMSO. Enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen. Cloning and construction of mutants In order to construct the vector pREPp-gfp, the promoter-gfp fragment was PCR amplified from the vector pLCN60.9 using the forward primer TAT TAT AAA TTC GAA CCT CAC CCT and the reverse primer CAT CCG CCA AAC AGC CAA GCT T, introducing HindIII sites at both ends of the PCR fragment. The fragment and the plasmid pREP4 (QIAGEN Nordic) were restricted with HindIII and then the fragment was ligated into the pREP4 plasmid. The transferring of the dntR gene from the pLCN60.9 plasmid to pQE-60 (QIAGEN Nordic) has been described.17 To introduce the various mutations into the dntR gene harbored in the pQE60 plasmid, the QuikChange SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used with the primers listed in Supplementary Data Table 1. The introduction of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions P. putida KT2440 harboring the plasmid pLCN60.9 was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium supplied with 1000 g/ml of ampicillin. E. coli DH5 cells harboring the plasmid pREPp-gfp were made electrocompetent according to the following protocol: A 1l culture of cells in LB medium with addition of 25 g/ml of kanamycin were grown to an A600 of 0.5 and then kept on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold 10% (v/v) glycerol and kept on ice for 20 min between each washing step. They were resuspended in 10% glycerol, and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Before each flow-cytometric analysis, E. coli DH5 cells harboring the plasmid pREPp-gfp were transformed with the plasmid pQE-60 with the various dntR variants. For analyses of the single-plasmid system, P.putida KT2440 or E.coli DH5 were transformed with the pLCN60.9 plasmid, and these cultures were supplied with 1000 g/ml and 100 g/ml of ampicillin, respectively. Cell cultures harboring pQE-60 and pREPp-gfp were grown in LB medium supplied with 100 g/ml of ampicillin and 25 g/ml of kanamycin at 30 °C with shaking. Cells from overnight cultures were used to inoculate new 1 ml cultures with a starting A600 of 0.05. These cultures were allowed to grow for 4 h (A6000.2­0.3) at 30 °C with shaking, and were then diluted with 1 ml of LB medium with 100 g/ml of ampicillin, 25 g/ml of kanamycin, 1% (v/v) TritonX-100 and 2 mM IPTG. In the control experiments without IPTG this dilution medium did not contain IPTG. After an additional 1 h, the various potential inducers (or the solvent DMSO in the control experiments without the inducer) were added to a final concentration of 500 M. Either 4 h or 15 h later, the cells were pelletted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS (10 mM Na2HPO4, 154 mM NaCl, pH 7.2). A 5 l sample was diluted 1:200 in PBS before flow-cytometric analysis. The rest was frozen and

In Vivo and In Vitro Investigation of DntR used for SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with a primary mouse pentahis antibody (Sigma) and a secondary AP antimouse antibody (Promega) to confirm expression of the DntR protein. Flow-cytometric analysis The flow-cytometric analyses was done with a FACS Vantage SE stream-in-air flow-cytometer (BD Biosciences). The water-cooled argon ion laser was aligned before each analysis using flow-cytometry beads for 488 nm excitation (Molecular Probes), and the same instrument settings were used for each analysis. Fluorescence was detected via a 530(±15) nm (green) band-pass filter. For each cell sample, data from 10,000 events were collected. Flowcytometric data were analyzed with the WinMDI software, and the mean fluorescence intensity for each cell population was measured. In each analysis, cells with addition of only DMSO and cells with addition of 1 mM IPTG and DMSO served as controls. All fluorescence intensities were related to the fluorescence intensity of the control with addition of IPTG and DMSO analyzed at the same occasion, since the fluorescence intensity is given in arbitrary units, and the exact value may vary between different occasions of analysis. Monitoring of the protein intrinsic fluorescence and data processing The instrument Fluorolog (Jobin Yvon Horiba) was used for the fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence spectra were recorded at 22 °C from 280 nm to 380 nm with excitation at 276 nm. Emission values at 330 nm were used in the data processing. When compounds were dissolved in DMSO, the changes of the fluorescence caused by the solvent was subtracted. The relative changes in the fluorescence intensity were assumed to be proportional to the concentration of the protein­inducer complex. In the case where the Kd value was similar to the protein concentration, equation (1) was used for the data processing. When the titration curve displayed two components, equation (2) was used.

Where F = F0­F and F0 and F are the emission values before and after addition of the inducer, respectively; a, a1 and a2 are constants; Kd, Kd1 and Kd2 are dissociation constants for one or two binding sites; [P] and [I] are molar concentrations of DntR and the inducer, respectively. Kd values were estimated by non-linear regression from the titration results using SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.) software. Salicylate is highly fluorescent; however, at 330 nm its emission does not interfere with the emission of the protein. Possible artifacts were taken into account as follows: salicylate, 2,4-DNT and 4-nitrobenzoate absorb light in the UV region, introducing an internal filter effect during titration; in this case, the true saturation with a ligand could not be reached and only the initial parts of the titration curves were used in the constant evaluation (up to 100 M). Benzoate does not absorb light in this wavelength range; nevertheless, saturation was not reached with this compound in the concentration range used owing to a contribution of unspecific binding. For

In Vivo and In Vitro Investigation of DntR this compound, equations (1) and (2) were used for data analysis in the concentration ranges up to 100 M and up to 1 mM, respectively. The difference between Kd values for the high-affinity site obtained from calculations using the different equations was between 10% (for F111L/ H169V) and 40% (for the WT). Protein purification, crystallisation, structure solution and refinement WT DntR and the mutants F111L and Y110S/F111V were expressed in E. coli. M15 [pREP4] or E. coli SG13009 [pREP4] and purified as described.17 The yield of the mutant proteins was typically lower than for WT DntR. The purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Crystals of the mutant proteins were grown under essentially the same conditions as those described for WT DntR.17 The stock protein concentration was 6­9 mg/ml and the buffer was 50 mM NaH2PO4/NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.3 M NaCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT and 17% (v/v) glycerol. The reservoir buffer contained 0.1 M imidazole (pH 6.5), 0.2 M KSCN and 0.8­1.4 M sodium acetate. Microseeding from WT crystals was often required. Cryoprotection was achieved as described for the crystals of the WT protein. Complete diffraction datasets were collected on ID14-EH2 of the ESRF (Table 1). Diffraction images were integrated with MOSFLM, and scaled and merged using SCALA. The resulting intensities were then converted to structure factors using the program TRUNCATE. The refined model of the monomer of WT DntR (PDB accession code 1UTH) stripped of ligands and solvent molecules was used as the search model for molecular replacement (MR) calculations to solve the structures of both mutants. MR was carried out using the program MOLREP. Initial electron density and difference density maps confirmed that the two proteins were indeed mutants. Several rounds of refinement (REFMAC5), visual inspection of electron density maps and manual rebuilding of the models using the program O was carried out with the careful placement of solvent and ligands concluding this procedure.32 Summaries of the composition and geometry of the final models for both crystal forms along with relevant refinement statistics are presented in Table 2. The programs MOSFLM, MOLREP, REFMAC5, SCALA and TRUNCATE are part of the CCP4 software package.33
