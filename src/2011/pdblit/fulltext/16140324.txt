Ferrochelatase, the enzyme catalyzing metallation of protoporphyrin IX at the terminal step of heme biosynthesis, was co-crystallized with an isomer mixture of the potent inhibitor N-methylmesoporphyrin (N-MeMP). The X-ray structure revealed the active site of the enzyme, to which only one of the isomers was bound, and for the ®rst time allowed characterization of the mode of porphyrin macrocycle distortion by ferrochelatase. Crystallization of ferrochelatase and N-MeMP in the presence of Cu2 leads to metallation and demethylation of N-MeMP. A mechanism of porphyrin distortion is proposed, which assumes that the enzyme holds pyrrole rings B, C and D in a vice-like grip and forces a 36  tilt on ring A.

Introduction
Metallated tetrapyrroles are used as prosthetic groups in proteins involved in biologically important processes such as photosynthesis, oxygen transport, drug metabolism and NO synthesis. In living organisms, metallation is catalyzed by a group of enzymes called chelatases: magnesium chelatase (chlorophyll), ferrochelatase (heme), siroheme synthase (siroheme) and cobalt chelatase. The molecular mechanisms of enzymatic and nonenzymatic metallation of tetrapyrroles have been studied most for porphyrins (Lavallee, 1988). One of the basic features of the mechanism of porphyrin metallation is assumed to be a deformation of the macrocycle to allow exposure of nitrogen lone pair electrons to the incoming metal ion. This consideration is based on the observation that for Nalkylated porphyrins, where the N-substituted pyrrole is tilted from the mean plane of the macrocycle, the rate of metallation in solution is 103 to 105-fold faster than for the corresponding planar porphyrins (Bain-Ackerman & Lavallee, 1979). The observation that N-methylmesoporphyrin IX (N-MeMP) is a potent inhibitor of ferrochelatase led to the suggestion that enzymatic metallation could occur via a distorted porphyrin intermediate

(De Matteis et al., 1982; Dailey & Fleming, 1983; Lavallee, 1988). This was later supported by experiments that showed that antibodies raised against N-MeMP could catalyze the metallation of nonalkylated mesoporphyrin, although ten times slower than ferrochelatase (Cochran & Schultz, 1990). Furthermore, the recently found similarity of the three-dimensional structures of ferrochelatase and anaerobic cobalt chelatase (Al-Karadaghi et al., 1997; Schubert et al., 1999) suggests the existence of a metallation mechanism that is common to all tetrapyrroles. Ferrochelatase, catalyzing metallation of protoporphyrin IX at the terminal step in protoheme biosynthesis (Figure 1), is the chelatase that is best known. In bacteria, ferrochelatase is found in the cytoplasm or associated with the cytoplasmic membrane, while in mammalian and yeast cells it is located in the mitochondrial membrane. The enzymes from different organisms have similar catalytic properties. In addition to their physiological substrates, Fe2 and protoporphyrin IX, they can catalyze the chelation of mesoporphyrin IX and deuteroporphyrin IX in vitro with divalent ions such as Zn2, Cu2 and Co2 (Dailey, 1990; Hansson & Hederstedt, 1994). Reduction in activity of heme synthesis in humans due to mutations in the ferrochelatase gene leads to erythropoietic porphyria. A symptom of this disease is light-sensitive dermatitis caused by overproduction of protoporphyrin and its deposition in skin and liver. In

actions with the porphyrin substrate. The conformational transition in the enzyme, required to accommodate the porphyrin, and the mode of distortion of the macrocycle upon binding to the protein have been analyzed. A mechanism for porphyrin distortion and metallation is proposed, which suggests that the enzyme ®xes pyrrole rings B, C and D, and forces a tilt in ring A, allowing the metal to enter the porphyrin via the tilted pyrrole.

Results
Crystallography The binding of N-MeMP to ferrochelatase is 103 times stronger than binding of planar porphyrins (Dailey & Fleming, 1983). This provides a stable complex, usually desirable in crystallization experiments. Another advantage of N-MeMP is the similarity of its side-groups to those of the authentic substrate, protoporphyrin IX, which would ensure a closely similar mode of interaction of the macrocycle with the enzyme. Details of puri®cation and crystallization are presented in Methods. The crystals of the complex of B. subtilis ferrochelatase with Ê N-MeMP diffracted to 1.9 A resolution (Table 1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement and re®ned to an R-factor of 18.1 % (R-free 23.1 %) with good geometry and no Ramachandran outliers. In an attempt to reveal the metal-binding site and its relation to the bound porphyrin, we crystallized ferrochelatase and N-MeMP in the Ê presence of Cu2. The crystals diffracted to 2.3 A

some cases this may even lead to fatal liver damage (Cox, 1997). Ferrochelatase from Bacillus subtilis consists of two a/b domains with a similar Rossmann-type of fold (Al-Karadaghi et al., 1997). A deep cleft is formed by protruding structural elements from both domains and contains several invariant residues shown to play key a role in catalysis (Kohno et al., 1994; Gora et al., 1996). Here, we present two structures of B. subtilis ferrochelatase: one complexed with N-MeMP, and one with a metallated mesoporphyrin Cu(MP), which is presumably a product of demethylation of N-MeMP by a dealkylation reaction. The structures have allowed identi®cation of the active site of ferrochelatase for the ®rst time and provide an insight into the inter-

223 avoid close contact with N-MeMP. This ¯ip also forces a displacement of L43 (Figure 3(c)), which may in turn trigger the displacement of helices a1-I and a2-I. L43 is conserved in all bacterial sequences but is replaced by a conserved alanine in eukaryotes, while residue 26 is conserved as leucine in most sequences with the exception of B. subtilis and human ferrochelatase (Figure 2(b)). The results indicate that the rearrangement of these residues may serve as a conformational switch in the process of porphyrin binding and release, at least in bacteria. Among the other amino acid residues that have to change their conformation drastically upon N-MeMP binding is F120. Its side-chain is rotated Ê to a new position about 4 A away from that in the porphyrin-free structure. N-MeMP binding to ferrochelatase Commercially available N-MeMP is a racemic mixture of compounds. The N-methyl group can be attached to any of the four pyrrole nitrogen atoms and may be located on either side of the porphyrin mean plane (eight isomers in total). The enzyme demonstrated clear stereo-speci®city by binding only one isomer. This isomer had its methyl group attached to pyrrole ring A and positioned above the mean plane of the porphyrin when viewed with the four pyrrole rings arranged in a clockwise direction. No trace of electron density for a methyl group bound to any other pyrrole ring could be seen (Figure 4). The binding and orientation of N-MeMP is stabilized by ionic, aromatic stacking and steric interactions of protein side-chains with the pyrrole rings. Thus, the distorted pyrrole ring A is ®xed in a position where a further tilt would be prevented Ê by I29, located at about 3.6 A from the pyrrole (Figure 5(a) and (b)), while a smaller tilt would bring it and its ethyl group into too-close contact with R46 and the invariant E264. Pyrrole ring B is stabilized on one side by aromatic stacking interaction with Y13, and by the invariant H183 on the other side. The position of ring C is stabilized by an edge-to-face aromatic stacking interaction with the invariant W230 and by interaction of the propionic acid side-chain with the amino group of K188 and the guanido group of R31. Ring D is packed against the main chain of I29, while on the opposite side it is stabilized by G224, which belongs to loop G224-D228. Except for glycine, any other residue at this position would interfere with porphyrin binding. The propionic acid side-chain of ring D interacts via a water molecule with the guanido group of R30. These residues, R30, R31 and K188, together with R33, form a positively charged ``lid'' that covers the top of the porphyrinbinding cleft. None of these arginine residues is conserved in the amino acid sequence of ferrochelatase (Figure 2(b)). However, chemical modi®cation of bovine ferrochelatase has shown that interaction of the propionic acid side-chains with arginine residues is crucial for ferrochelatase

resolution and the structure was re®ned to an R-factor of 18.3 % (R-free 25.7 %). Since all these data were collected at cryo-temperatures from ¯ash-frozen crystals, while the data for the structure without porphyrin were collected at room temperature (Al-Karadaghi et al., 1997), we had to collect new cryogenic data for the latter. The crysÊ tals diffracted to about 1 A resolution. However, due to shortage of synchrotron beam time, data to Ê only 1.8 A resolution were collected (the roomÊ temperature data extended to 1.9 A resolution). Using these data, the structure was re®ned to an R-factor of 17.7 % (R-free 20.5 %). This model was used subsequently for the comparison between the apo and N-MeMP complex structures. Data collection and re®nement statistics are shown in Table 1. The structure of ferrochelatase in complex with N-MeMP Figure 2(a) shows a schematic view of the threedimensional structure of ferrochelatase with bound N-MeMP. The inhibitor binds in the cleft between the domains, with pyrrole rings C and D and their propionic side-chains extending outwards, and rings A and B positioned in the interior of the protein. A fully hydrated magnesium ion binds closely to the surface of the enzyme (Figure 2(a)). Figure 2(b) shows an alignment of bacterial and eukaryotic ferrochelatase amino acid sequences. The secondary structure elements involved in porphyrin binding are shown in red and are identical with those proposed earlier to be involved in porphyrin binding (Al-Karadaghi et al., 1997). In order to analyze the effect of inhibitor binding on the overall three-dimensional structure of ferrochelatase, the Ca atoms of the models with and without bound porphyrin were superimposed. For the superposition, only b-sheet residues from domain II were used. The root-mean square difference (rmsd) versus residue number for the Ca atoms is shown in Figure 3(a). It can be seen from Figure 3 that the part of the structure up to approximately residue 140 in domain I, and C-terminal helix a6-II that is structurally associated with it, have higher rmsd values, on average, than most of domain II and helix a6-I that is structurally associated with it. The largest differences occur around helices a1-I and a2-I in domain I and loop G224-D228 in domain II. All of these elements (marked in red in Figure 2(a)) contribute to the structure of the porphyrin-binding cleft. Their displacement due to porphyrin binding results in a slight opening of the cleft, which can be seen in Figure 3(b). A view of the interior of the cleft in the region around the bound N-MeMP, showing the position of amino acid side-chains before and after porphyrin binding, is presented in Figure 3(c). One of the largest side-chain position rearrangments is that of Y26. In the N-MeMP complex structure, the aromatic ring of Y26 has moved to a new position Ê approximately 8 A from the old one in order to

activity, although the particular residues responsible for interaction with the propionate groups are not known (Dailey & Fleming, 1986). This indicates that in other ferrochelatases some other arginine residues may be involved in interactions with the propionic acid side-chains. The size of the binding cleft puts some restrictions on the size of the groups that can be attached to the nitrogen atom and to the b-carbon atoms of the pyrrole ring. The N-methyl group of N-MeMP Ê is located at 3.3 A from the carbonyl group of S222 Ê and 3.8 A from the side-chain of H183. A larger group would interfere with the protein structure and have weaker binding and lower inhibitory activity, in accord with earlier observations (De Matteis et al., 1982). Similarly, as shown by Dailey et al. (1989), any porphyrin with larger groups attached to the b-carbon atoms of pyrrole rings A and B would be a poor substrate for ferrochelatase. Distortion of N-MeMP Generally, distortions of a porphyrin macrocycle may be induced either by various substituents attached to its periphery or by interactions with protein side-chains (Ma et al., 1998). The tight binding of N-MeMP to ferrochelatase leads to a considerable distortion of the macrocycle conformation from planarity. The tilt from the mean plane of the porphyrin for pyrrole rings B, D and C (calculated from the b-carbon atom with the highest deviation from the plane) is about 5  , while for ring A it is 36  . This value exceeds those

observed for unbound mono-N-substituted porphyrins (between 20  and 30  ; Lavallee, 1988), although it is reminiscent of values observed in metallated N-substituted porphyrins and in the three-dimensional structure of the antibody-NMeMP complex (Lavallee et al., 1978; Romesberg et al., 1998). Interestingly, even in the antibody-NMeMP complex, the isomer with the N-methyl group attached to pyrrole ring A was bound to the protein. In this case, the tilt is imposed by direct interaction of ring A with a tyrosine residue. The deviations of individual macrocycle atoms from the least-squares plane calculated using all ring atoms of pyrroles B, C and D, and only the acarbon atoms of ring A, are shown in Figure 6. The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) from the plane for the atoms included in the plane de®nition is Ê 0.17 A. As seen from this Figure, the meso carbon atoms are alternately above or below the porphyrin mean plane (i.e. positive or negative values for the deviation of ring atoms from the plane). This type of distortion is a general characteristic of a ruf¯ed conformation (Ma et al., 1998). The ruf¯ing is also characterized by deviation from 0  of the torsion angle CaNNCa, which is approximately 14  for rings B-D and 8  for rings A-C. In an ideally ruf¯ed conformation, all macrocycle atoms along a given edge (CbCa-Cmeso-Ca-Cb) should be on the same side of the porphyrin mean plane. However, examination of Figure 6 reveals that the Cb atoms of rings A, B, and C are alternately below and above the mean plane, a characteristic of a saddled conformation. This shows that the main distortion

of the ring is of a ruf¯ed-saddled type. An analysis using the normal-coordinate structural decomposition procedure for characterizing heme distortions (Jentzen et al., 1997) even showed the presence of doming, waving and propellering distortions. We compared the structure of N-MeMP from the ferrochelatase complex with N-MeMP from the antibody:N-MeMP complex. The rmsd for the atoms used in plane de®nition is in this case Ê 0.09 A, about half of that calculated for N-MeMP from the ferrochelatase:N-MeMP complex. The pattern of alternating meso carbon atoms is seen also in this case, although it is less pronounced (Figure 6). The positions of the meso carbon atoms are opposite to those of the corresponding atoms in the ferrochelatase complex, due to the opposite tilt of pyrrole ring A. It is apparent from this comparison that, although the tilt angles of rings A are similar, the distortion of the overall conformation of N-MeMP induced by ferrochelatase is greater than that induced by the antibody.

Metallation of N-MeMP Difference electron density maps calculated using data collected from crystals of ferrochelatase and N-MeMP crystallized in the presence of Cu2 unexpectedly revealed that Cu2 was actually inserted into the porphyrin moiety (Figure 7). Since upon crystallization the protein is ®rst incubated with the inhibitor and then mixed with a solution containing Cu2, metallation may have occurred while the porphyrin was bound to the enzyme. The overall conformations of the non-metallated and metallated complexes are essentially similar, revealing that the enzyme conformation is primarily affected by porphyrin binding rather than Ê metallation. The metal ion is approximately 0.17 A from the mean plane of the macrocycle and is coordinated by the ring nitrogen atoms and Y13. Metal-binding distances and angles are shown in Table 2. For comparison, the corresponding parameters are shown for the highly distorted complex (Lavallee et al., 1978) chloro-N-methyl-a,b,g,d-

One of the largest shifts is that of Y26, which has to move away from the porphyrin. The ¯ip of this side-chain to a new position forces a shift of L43, which may in turn trigger the shift in helices a1-I and a2-I.

tetraphenylporphinatozinc(II) (Zn(N-MeTPP)Cl). It can be seen from Table 2 that the angles at the metal ion differ by about 20  in the two metalloporphyrins. This is a result of the zinc ion being at Ê 0.65 A from the mean plane in the Zn(N-MeTPP)Cl structure. Another signi®cant difference is the distance from the metal ion to the nitrogen atoms. In the Zn(N-MeTPP)Cl, due to the alkylation of pyrrole ring A, a weak bond to its nitrogen atom results in a distance that is longer than that between the metal and nitrogen atoms of rings B, C and D. In the Cu(N-MeMP) complex, the distances from the copper ion to all nitrogen atoms are similar, suggesting equivalent bonds. This can be the result of demethylation of pyrrole ring A by a dealkylation reaction (Lavallee, 1985). An examination of the electron density in Figure 7 shows only some residual density for the methyl group. This may be explained by some portion of the total amount of N-MeMP in the drops not being metal-

lated due to the low occupancy of the copper ion (about 67 %). The reason for this low occupancy is the concentration of the metal being only 0.25 mM, which is lower than the total concentration of protein and N-MeMP in the crystallization drops. At higher metal concentrations, the crystals were too small and not suitable for X-ray data collection. Thus, the determined structure is actually that of ferrochelatase in complex with Cu(II)-mesoporphyrin. Since, as shown earlier, metalloporphyrins are effective inhibitors of ferrochelatase (Dailey et al., 1989), the present complex must be an inhibited state of the enzyme. The reaction conditions for cleaving the methyl group from the pyrrole nitrogen atom by copper are much milder than the conditions for the same reaction performed by zinc (Lavallee, 1985). In order to test the possibility of incorporating zinc into N-MeMP, we co-crystallized ferrochelatase with N-MeMP in the presence of Zn2(unpublished

results). In this case, electron density maps Ê calculated at 2.3 A resolution did not show any demethylation or metal insertion into the porphyrin. As seen in Figure 6, the macrocycle distortion pattern of the metal-free N-MeMP is preserved after metallation. The rmsd to the plane for the Ê atoms included in the plane de®nition is 0.19 A, in the same range observed for the metal-free structure. A noticeable difference between the structures

is the slightly longer distance of nitrogen atoms in pyrrole rings B, C and D from the mean plane. This increases the tilt of rings B, C and D to about 7  . The tilt of ring A relative to the mean macrocycle plane is about 36  , similar to that of the metal-free complex. It can be concluded that the conformation of the porphyrin, while imposed by the protein matrix, is not affected by metallation. Also, the removal of the methyl group does not affect the tilt of ring A. This suggests that the con-

Discussion
The present study reveals features of enzymatic porphyrin metallation that could not be forseen from the porphyrin-free structure of B. subtilis ferrochelatase. The location of the invariant residue H183 with respect to the porphyrin, shown previously in structural (Al-Karadaghi et al., 1997) and biochemical studies (Kohno et al., 1994) to be involved in metal binding, suggests that the metal ion enters the macrocycle via the highly canted ring A. This observation is different from what has been proposed earlier from studies on non-enzymatic systems, namely that the metal enters from the side opposite to that of the canted pyrrole (Lavallee, 1988). In the presence of a porphyrin substrate, the metal ion should bind approximately at a site where there is a solvent molecule in the present complexes (Figure 5(a)). Its position is close to that of the metal soaked into the apoenzyme structure and it is located at hydrogen bonding distances from the side-chains of H183 Ê and the invariant E264, and 3.7 A from the alkylated nitrogen atom. A copper ion at this position in the ferrochelatase:N-MeMP complex may attack the methyl-nitrogen bond, resulting in dealkylation of the porphyrin. This assumes that even E264 is involved in metal binding. The metal ion may enter the active site via a highly charged channel, at the top of which, both in the present structures and in the porphyrin-free structure, we observed a fully hydrated magnesium ion (Figure 2(a)). The Ê magnesium ion is positioned approximately 8 A from H183. The solvent molecules in the magnesium complex are coordinated, directly or via other solvent molecules, to the conserved residues S222, D268 and E272. Interestingly, in the structure of the cobalt chelatase (Schubert et al., 1999) the authors placed a sulfate ion at a position structurally equivalent to that of the magnesium complex Ê at about 8.5 A from a histidine residue, assumed to be equivalent to H183 in B. subtilis ferrochelatase. This suggests that this site may have a similar function in the two chelatases. The conformation of the particular isomer bound in the present structures will most likely be adopted by the porphyrin substrate, with a tilt

angle of about 36  being imposed by the protein matrix on pyrrole ring A. The mechanism leading to the distortion of the macrocycle upon binding to the enzyme can be envisaged from the present complex structures. The enzyme functions mechanically as a vice by ®xing the position of the porphyrin via pyrrole rings B, C and D. Ring A will be forced to adopt a tilted conformation in order to ®t into the binding pocket. Metal binding may contribute to the distortion, as was observed in resonance Raman experiments with yeast ferrochelatase (Blackwood et al., 1997). The observed interactions of N-MeMP with the protein explain many of the earlier experimental results and provide valuable insights into the mechanism of porphyrin distortion and metallation. However, one should keep in mind that the position of the porphyrin substrate in the enzyme may not coincide entirely with the position of the inhibitor in the present complex. This can be clari®ed only by future studies, which may also reveal the extent of conservation of the mechanism of porphyrin metallation in other chelatases. Some variations should be expected in the mechanism due to the different properties of the metals inserted and the tetrapyrroles being metallated.

Methods
Crystallization Ferrochelatase from B. subtilis was prepared according to Hansson & Al-Karadaghi (1995) using the sitting drop technique. Crystallization drops were made by ®rst preparing a mixture of 10 ml of 1 mM B. subtilis ferrochelatase and 1 mM N-MeMP (Porphyrin Products, Logan, Utah), which was then mixed with 10 ml of reservoir solution. The reservoir solution contained 0.5 ml of 30 % (w/v) PEG2000, 0.2 M MgCl2, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Crystals were obtained through microseeding of the sitting drops at room temperature. For co-crystallization of the metal complex, CuSO4 was added to the reservoir solution to a concentration of 0.5 mM before mixing with the protein:N-MeMP solution. Data collection and refinement Crystals were transferred from their mother liquor to a drop containing 18 ml of reservoir sol-

ution and 2 ml of PEG400, and after about one minute, ¯ash-frozen directly in a stream of boiled-off nitrogen. All data were collected using a MAR345 detector at the MAX II synchrotron laboratory, station BL711, Lund, and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The structure of the complex of ferrochelatase with N-MeMP was solved by molecular replacement È with the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1990), and È re®ned using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The program O was used for model building (Jones et al., 1991). A modi®ed X-PLOR ®le containing re®nement parameters for heme was used for N-MeMP. In order to verify the geometrical parameters of NMeMP, all force constants for the torsion angles at the last stage of re®nement were set to 0 and 100 cycles of positional re®nement were run. The geometry of the resulting model was very close to that of the restrained model. New cryo data for the Ê apo-enzyme were collected to 1.8 A resolution and the re®ned structure was used for comparison with the complex structures. Data collection and re®nement statistics are shown in Table 1. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates and structure factor amplitudes of the N-MeMP and Cu(MP) complexes were submitted to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession numbers 1C1H and 1C9E, respectively).
