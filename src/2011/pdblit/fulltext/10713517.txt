To investigate a potential candidate material for making arti®cial red blood cells to supplement blood transfusion, the Ê X-ray structure of porcine haemoglobin at 1.8 A resolution was determined as part of research towards synthesizing human blood. Porcine haemoglobin was crystallized by the vapor-diffusion method, producing crystals of dimensions 0.3±0.5 mm after successive seeding. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters Ê a = 68.10, b = 72.27, c = 114.85 A. The initial phase was determined by the molecular-replacement method, using human oxyhaemoglobin as a model. The ®nal R factor was 21.1% for 36 820 re¯ections after validation of 574 water molecules. The r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths, angles, torsion angles and improper angles from their ideal values are Ê 0.017 A, 3.0, 20.6 and 1.8 , respectively. The average B factor is Ê Ê 33.63 A2 for the haemoglobin molecule and 50.53 A2 for the water molecules. The structure could be superimposed on a Ê Ê 2.8 A resolution structure with an r.m.s. difference of 0.59 A in Ê in side-chain atomic main-chain atomic positions and 1.27 A positions. Porcine and human haemoglobins are compared. A tentative model for arti®cial blood is proposed based on the complementarity relationship of the surface charges between haemoglobin and the surrounding cell membrane.

1. Introduction
Haemoglobin (Hb) based blood substitutes, made of natural oxygen-carrier proteins which are present in red blood cells and are responsible for the transport of oxygen and partly carbon dioxide in vivo, ®t the demands of human transfusion excellently (Vandegriff & Winslow, 1991). To avoid the transmission of human viruses contaminating outdated blood, animal and recombinant Hbs are increasingly being considered as possible sources. Therefore, Lee et al. (1992) have attempted to develop porcine Hb-based blood substitutes, as there is an abundant porcine market in Asia. The results obtained indicated the potential of the novel material for application in medical treatment (Lee et al., 1992; Kan & Lee, 1994; Wang et al., 1996). However, immunological problems of xenogenic infusion and the delicate regulation of oxygen capacity of porcine Hb retarded further clinical applications. Fundamental research regarding the molecular structure and function of porcine Hb is needed in order to work out a safe and effective modi®cation in order to proceed with porcine Hb-based blood substitutes. The allosteric properties and oxygen-transport characteristics of haemoglobin have attracted considerable study. Many papers have been published on the elucidation of the structure±function relationships of haemoglobins (Bolton &

We initiated the three-dimensional structure determination of procine haemoglobin (Hsieh et al., 1992) as part of research work on this project. Puri®ed stroma-free haemoglobin extracted from domestic porcine blood is a potential candidate material for making arti®cial red blood cells to supplement blood transfusion (Lee et al., 1992). Although the structure of aquomet porcine haemoglobin (pHb) has been published (Katz et al., 1994), this was only presented at the resolution of Ê 2.8 A. Several large uncertainties could not be resolved owing to the inadequate resolution. The X-ray structure determinaÊ tion of domestic pig haemoglobin at 1.8 A resolution is presented here in order to resolve these structural uncertainties. Many interesting structural differences between pHb and human haemoglobin (hHb) have been discovered. clotting. Red blood cells, isolated from whole blood by centrifugation (Hitachi centrifuge, Himac CR20B2) at 5000 rev minÀ1 for 15 min, were washed three times with two volumes of 0.9%(w/v) saline and then haemolyzed by adding three volumes of deionized water. Subsequent centrifugation at 15 000g for 60 min yielded Hb solution free of visible cell debris. The solution was mixed with stock solutions of PEG 1500 and K2HPO4/NaH2PO4 to obtain a solution containing 12.5% PEG, 12.5% phosphate pH 10 with the addition of a small amount of NaOH. After phase separation, the top phase was withdrawn and added to NaH2PO4 to a ®nal composition of 12.5% PEG, 12.5% phosphate pH 7. After mixing and phase separation, the bottom phase containing Hb was dialyzed with deionized water to remove surplus phosphate. Porcine Hb powder was obtained by lyophilization and was stored at 253 K.

2.1. Isolation and purification

Fresh porcine whole blood obtained from a slaughterhouse was mixed with 1/10 volume of sodium citrate to avoid blood

Crystallization of porcine haemoglobin was carried out at room temperature using the vapour-diffusion method (McPherson, 1982) under conditions described previously (Blow, 1958). The puri®ed haemoglobin was dissolved in distilled water and an 80 mg mlÀ1 solution was prepared. 2.8 M phosphate solution was used as precipitant (made by mixing K2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 in the molar ratio 1.35:1.00 at pH 6.8). The crystallization conditions were ®rst investigated by vapour diffusion in hanging drops. After small crystals were grown, the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method was used. Large drops containing 10 ml of protein and 12 ml of 2.8 M phosphate solution were used in the sitting drops, with 10 ml phosphate solution in the reservoir. Small seed crystals were successively transferred between equilibrating protein solutions in spot plates until the crystals grew to dimensions of 0.3±0.5 mm. For X-ray analysis, a suitable crystal was mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary with a small amount of mother liquor to prevent dryness and was sealed with diffusion-pump oil. Data were collected on an R-AXIS II imaging-plate detector system using Cu K radiation generated by a Rigaku RU-300 rotating-anode generator operating at a voltage of 50 kV and a current of 80 mA. The crystal-to-detector distance was set to 100 mm. Intensity data were processed using a software package supplied by the Molecular Structure Corporation. A summary of the data-collection statistics is given in Table 1.

self-rotation function (Rossmann & Blow, 1962) was calculated. To obtain the initial phases for the electron-density map, the molecular-replacement method was then applied using human oxyhaemoglobin (hHb; Shaanan, 1983) as the model. The atomic coordinates of the entire tetramer were modi®ed so that all non-identical residues between hHb and pHb were substituted with glycine in the cross-rotation searches. Coordinates ®les for oxy-hHb were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). The amino-acid identity between hHb and pHb is 84% for the -subunit and 86% for the subunit from a sequence comparison. The top peak from the rotation search was 22' above the mean, with the next highest peak at 8'. The rotated dimers were then translated into the unit cell separately, followed by a ®nal translation-search solution for the oriented tetramer, resulting in a conventional crystallographic R factor of 40.2%. Subsequent rigid-body re®nement in X-PLOR, treating the monomer as an individual rigid body, lowered the R factor to 36.8% for data in the 8.0± Ê 3.0 A resolution range. For this model, simulated-annealing re®nement was applied and the R factor fell to 28.5%. The 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps were inspected for further manual intervention using the QUANTA97 program (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, USA). After two rounds of major manual intervention, the structure was re®ned by simulatedannealing re®nement using a starting temperature of 3000 K. Each of several rounds of minor manual intervention was followed by positional re®nement. The R factor at this stage was 26.2%. Examining the 2Fo À Fc electron-density map with peak density >3' revealed that there was no possibility of ®nding the phosphate group surrounding this molecule within Ê the distance range 3.5±4.5 A. Afterwards, provisional positions for water molecules were selected from a 2Fo À Fc electron-density map with peak density >3'; calculated elecÊ tron densities within 2.6±4.0 A of the protein were accepted. Subsequent re®nement steps with water molecules in these positions, interspersed by examination of the difference maps, validated the positions of 574 water molecules using the cutoff

Ê criteria of two hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors within 3.0 A Ê 2. The R factor was of the provisional positions and B < 60 A reduced to 21.1% for 36 820 re¯ections with F > 2'(F) in the Ê resolution range 8.0±1.8 A in the ®nal re®nement. Details of the re®nement parameters are given in Table 2.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Quality of the structure

The ®nal model comprises 5152 non-H atoms, representing two  dimer molecules with 574 solvent molecules [treated as O(water) atoms]. Each pHb molecule consists of four polypeptides and four haem groups. The quality of the re®nement of pHb has been determined using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). In the Ramachandran plot, 99.6% residues are in the most favoured and allowed regions, none are in the disallowed regions and only two residues, Asp75 in the 1 subunit and His77 in the 1 subunit, are in the generously allowed regions. However, these residues clearly ®t the electron-density map well. Other measures of quality applied by PROCHECK indicate that the re®ned parameters, including 3-angles, standard deviations, bad contacts, chirality, hydrogen-bond energies and side-chain torsion angles, are all inside the limits, except for one in a better region derived from well re®ned structures of comparable resolution. The theoretical estimate of coordinate errors using a Luzzati plot Ê (Luzzati, 1952) is 0.15 A. The r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths, angles, torsion angles and improper angles from their ideal Ê values are 0.017 A, 3.0, 20.6 and 1.8 , respectively. The average Ê Ê B factors are 32.63 A2 for the pHb molecules and 50.53 A2 for the water molecules. A representative electron-density map of the H-helix of the 1 subunit is shown in Fig. 1. It is clearly obvious that this model ®ts exactly to the electron-density map Ê owing to the higher resolution (1.8 A). A comparison of the

In general, Pro, Asp, Glu and His residues are not included in the helical 3.2. Secondary structures region, as the Pro residue is an imino acid and Asp, Glu and His residues carry charges which involve the hydrogen bond to The -subunit of pHb has seven helices (A, B, C, E, F, G and water molecules. However, in the present structure all the H) and seven non-helical regions, whereas the -subunit above residues are included in the helical region, which also contains eight helical segments (A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H) and occurs in the structure of ferric soybean leghaemoglobin (Ellis et al., 1997). When this structure Ê was superimposed on the 2.8 A resolution structure (solved by Katz et al., 1994), the r.m.s. Ê deviation was 0.59 A for backÊ bone atoms and 1.27 A for sidechain atoms (Fig. 3). The strucÊ tures of pHb (1.8 A) and hHb are quite similar overall; the r.m.s. deviation of all backbone atoms between these two structures is Ê 0.78 A (Fig. 4), which is similar to the r.m.s. value between the pHb Ê (2.8 A) and hHb structures. This r.m.s. value is slightly higher than Ê the theoretical value of 0.5 A calculated from the sequence± structure relationship for homologous proteins (Chothia & Lesk, 1986). The plots of the least-squares superpositions of the 1 subunit on the 2 subunit and the 1 subunit on the 2 subunit reveal that the conformations of the 1 and 2 subunits and the 1 and 2 subunits are similar, except some terminal residues and few intermediate residues. In porcine haemoglobin, the  subunit superimposes upon its sister subunit with r.m.s. deviations of Ê 2.03 A for side-chain atoms and Ê for backbone atoms. 0.83 A There are six regions which have major structural differences in the  subunit: two residues in the amino terminal, two residues in the A helix (Val15 and Gly16), two residues in the CE loop (His50 and Gly51), two residues Figure 2 in the EF loop (Asp74 and Sequence alignment of porcine haemoglobin.

MetHb content appeared to have increased. A 400±650 nm wavelength spectrum indicated that the MetHb content had increased to $10%. It should be taken into consideration that the crystallization conditions may also have some effect. When puri®ed porcine Hb was characterized, porcine Hb exhibited a higher oxygen af®nity [P50 = 1.3 (1) kPa] than human Hb [P50 = 2.0 (1) kPa] (Devenuto & Zegna, 1982). The Hill coef®cient (n) of porcine Hb was calculated to be 2.16; that is, a little smaller than human Hb (2.48). The value is taken as a measure of the cooperative binding of oxygen by Hb. Accordingly, human Hb was found to have a more prominent haem±haem interaction than porcine Hb. In the Fo À Fc maps of all four subunits, there is a clear electron density between the Fe atom and the distal histidine N atom in each region. This implies that there is a water molecule present. From this point of view, the present haemoglobin shows an aquomet form. This is evident because the re®nement was carried out to Ê Ê 1.8 A resolution in contrast to the 2.8 A structure (Katz et al., 1994). The pHb is more likely to be in the R state for the quaternery structure in the present haemoglobin. The haem groups ®t very well to the 2Fo À Fc map (Fig. 5). The atoms of each haem group in pHb make extensive van der Waals

contacts with neighbouring residues in the protein core (Fig. 6).
3.4. Complementarity relationship

The pHb tetramer binds together through a physical complementarity relationship. Charges on the surface of each monomer play an important role in pHb for complementary attraction, such that the entire tetramer remains stable after being isolated and puri®ed. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the 1 subunit of pHb calculated using the program GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991; Nicholls, 1993) are consistent with those obtained by Katz et al. (1994), but exhibit sharper contrasts in charge distribution (Fig. 7). The surface-charge distributions of mutually attracted portions between monomers were calculated using the program INSIGHTII (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, USA) and are shown in Fig. 8. A speci®c binding site usually exhibits a certain small region of acidic or basic amino acids to complement its potential receptor or target. However, Figs. 8 and 9 show no such de®nite region, but instead show nearly uniform `island' distributions of positive (blue), negative (red) and neutral (white) surface charges. A tentative explanation for the uniform `island' charge distributions is as follows. Haemoglobin (Hb) is isolated from erythrocytes and is an important component of red blood cells. The cell membrane consists of double-chain amphiphile structures that encompass the spherical bilayer. The polar ends of the double-chain amphiphiles inside the blood-cell vesicle form a complementarity relationship with the `island' surface of the Hb

(Fig. 9). Arti®cial blood is the ®nal aim of our pHb structure determination. To arti®cially encapulate Hb with synthetic polymers or phospholipid vesicles is a great step towards the production of man-made blood. Stabilized phospholipid vesicle-encapsulated Hb (Tsuchida, 1994) indicates the successful complementarity relationship between Hb and the erythrocyte membrane.
