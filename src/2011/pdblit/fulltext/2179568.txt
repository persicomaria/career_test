The aspartic proteinase, endothiapepsin (EC 3.4.23.6), was complexed with a highly potent renin inhibitor, H-261 (t-Boc-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leug-HVal-Ile-His), where o_H denotes a hydroxyethylene (-(S)CHOH-CH2-) transition-state isostere in the scissile bond surrogate. Crystals were grown in a form that has the same space group P21 as the uncomplexed enzyme, but with a 10 A decrease in the length of the a-axis and a 13° decrease in the t-angle. X-ray data have been collected to a resolution of 1-6 A. The rotation and translation parameters defining the position of the enzyme in the unit cell were determined previously using another enzyme-inhibitor complex that crystallized isomorphously with that of H-261. The molecule was refined using restrained least-squares refinement and the positions of non-hydrogen atoms of the inhibitor and water molecules were defined by difference Fourier techniques. The enzyme-inhibitor complex and 322 water molecules were further refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 0"14. Apart from a small rigid group rotation of a domain comprising residues 190 to 302 and small movements in the flap, there is little difference in conformation between the complexed and uncomplexed forms of the enzyme. The inhibitor is bound in an extended conformation along the active site cleft, and the hydroxyl group of the hydroxyethylene moiety is hydrogen-bonded to both catalytic aspartate carboxylates. The complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the mainchain of the inhibitor and the enzyme. All side-chains of the inhibitor are in van der Waals' contact with groups in the enzyme and define a series of specificity pockets along the active site cleft. The study provides useful clues as to how this potent renin inhibitor (ICso value of 0 " 7 x l 0 - g M ) may bind renin. In particular it defines the interactions of the hydroxyethylene transition-state isostere with the enzyme more precisely than has been previously possible and therefore provides a useful insight into interactions in the transition state complex.

1. I n t r o d u c t i o n Aspartic proteinases are associated with the onset of several pathological conditions such as hypertension (renin), gastric ulcers (pepsin), muscular dystrophy and neoplastic diseases (cathepsins D and E), so their inhibition is of considerable clinical interest. The recent discovery that the retroviral proteinases are also related to the pepsin-like aspartic proteinases has stimulated further interest, t Paper II in this series is Cooper et al.

especially in view of the possibility that their inhibition could retard viral replication. The plasma enzyme renin catalyses the ratelimiting cleavage of angiotensinogen to yield the decapeptide angiotensin-I (AI§). Subsequent removal of the earboxy-terminal dipeptide from AI is carried out by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) thereby yielding angiotensin II (AII). Binding of AII to its receptor initiates vasco§ Abbreviations used: AI, angiotensin-I; ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; AII, angiotensin II;

constriction and retention of sodium and w a t e r in the kidneys. This in t u r n increases the blood volume and consequently increases the blood pressure. ACE is the t a r g e t for a n u m b e r of drugs such as Captopril and Enalopril, which are commercially available and used in the t r e a t m e n t of hypertension, hyperaldosteronism and congestive heart failure (Ondetti & Cushman, 1980). However, renin inhibitors m a y have some a d v a n t a g e s in t h e control of hypertension as t h e y can be very specific. Progress in the d e v e l o p m e n t of renin inhibitors has centred around the design and analysis of the analogues of the minimal s u b s t r a t e sequence, residues 6 to 13 of angiotensinogen. Inhibitors, in which the L e u - V a l scissile bond in the octapeptide sequence of h u m a n angiotensinogen is replaced b y various non-hydrolysable analogues e.g. -CH2-NH-, lower blood pressure b o t h in primates (Tree et al., 1983) and h u m a n s (Webb et al., 1985). P e p s t a t i n , which has a K i value of 5 x 10 -11 M for pepsin ( W o r k m a n & Burkitt, 1979), requires a central statine for p o t e n t inhibition (Rich et al., 1980; Rich & Bernatowicz, 1982). T h e main-chain - C H O H - C H 2 - C O - N H - ((S)-enantiomer) g r o u p was later shown b y X - r a y analysis to bind the catalytic a s p a r t a t e groups of the enzyme ( J a m e s et al., 1982; B o t t et al., 1982), the hydroxyl forming hydrogen bonds to both e n z y m e carboxyl groups. Thus, inhibitors with statine as the central residue in sequences otherwise similar to the angiotensinogen cleavage site p r o v e d to be useful inhibitors (Szelke et al., 1982; Boger et al., 1985). Substitution of a shorter h y d r o x y e t h y l e n e isostere (-CI-IOH-CH2-) ((S)-enantiomer) resulted in a very highly p o t e n t h u m a n renin inhibitor (H-261) with an inhibition constant of 0"7 n ~ (Szelke et al., 1985). This compound is also a good inhibitor of the H I V - I proteinase (Richards et al., 1989). I n this c o m p o u n d the - C H O H - function is assumed to mimic the tetrahedral geminal diol and the -CH 2- function mimics the - N H ~ of the transition state. X - r a y structural studies of different analogues complexed with endothiapepsin are reviewed b y Cooper & H a r r i s (1989) and Blundell et al. (1987). X - r a y studies of the p o t e n t h y d r o x y e t h y l e n e inhibitor of h u m a n renin, H-261, complexed with endothiapepsin were initially carried out on crystals t h a t were isomorphous with those of the native enzyme, but d a t a were collected only to medium resolution (Blundell et al., 1987). More recently we found t h a t u n d e r the same conditions a less disordered crystal form t h a t contains less solvent a n d diffracts to higher resolution (1"6 A, 1 A = 0.1 nm) could be obtained over a longer crystallization period. Here, we r e p o r t details of the three-dimensional structure of the complex with emphasis on the description of e n z y m e - i n h i b i t o r interactions a n d on the n a t u r e of the specificity sub-sites. Since we h a v e been able to collect d a t a f r o m these crystals to a higher resolution t h a n for a n y other inhibitor, the analysis of the three-dimensional structure is the m o s t accurate of the endothiapepsin complexes. Thus, the e n z y m e structure is also briefly described

(a) Synthesis of inhibitor The inhibitor, H-261, has a formula t-Boc-His-Pro-PheHis-Leu9-HVal-Ile-His, where t-Boe is tertiary butoxycarbonyl and 9-M denotes a hydroxyethylene (-CHOH-CH2-) transition-state isostere in the scissile bond surrogate. All chiral centres, including those of the isostere, are of the S-form. The inhibitor was synthesized using the procedures described by Szelke et al. (1985) and provided by Dr M. Szelke as freeze-dried samples, which had a quoted purity of about 90o/0. (b) Crystallization Endothiapepsin was extracted from a fungal rennet, Sure-curd, from Pfizer Inc., by successive ammonium sulphate precipitations (Whitaker, 1970). Crystals of endothiapepsin complexed with the synthetic inhibitor were grown by an adaptation of the method described by Moews & Bunn (1970), which involves a protein concentration of 2mg/ml in 0"1 M-sodium acetate buffer (pH 4"6). A sufficient quantity of the inhibitor was added to a weighed sample of the enzyme to give a 10-fold molar excess of the inhibitor. To ensure complex formation they were stirred together in the crystallization buffer for several hours before filtration and addition of the fine ground ammonium sulphate to 55~/o saturation (2"2 M). The solution was filtered into 2 ml batches and a few drops of acetone were added to each. These were left to crystallize at room temperature for several months after which good crystals appeared. The crystal data for the enzyme-inhibitor complex are given in Table 1. The crystals are non-isomorphous with

the original form obtained from the uncomplexed enzyme and for some inhibitor complexes (Foundling el al., 1987; Blundell et al., 1987, and references cited therein). Although the space group remains P21, as for the uneomplexed endothiapepsin, the unit cell dimension along the a-axis is shorter by about 10 A and the fl-angle is 13° smaller. Crystals isomorphous to the H-261 complex had previously been obtained for a complex of endothiapepsin with another inhibitor (BW625), which was solved by molecular replacement (Cooper, 1989). This crystal form has closer packing in the unit cell giving an estimated solvent content of 39~/o as compared with 550/o for the native crystal form. The new crystals diffract to a higher resolution than native crystals allowing collection of X-ray data to 1.6 A resolution. (c) Data collection and structure determination Four crystals were employed in collecting the diffraction data to a resolution of 1"6 A using an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 diffractometer. A total of 38,375 reflections were recorded and collected for radiation decay, Lorentz-polarization and absorption (North a at., 1968). The Fobs values were merged (Rae, 1965; Rae & Blake, 1966) to give a unique set of 31,666 reflections with a merging R-factor of 0"055. The endothiapepsin co-ordinares obtained in the analysis of the complex with BW625 (Cooper, 1989) were used to calculate the structure factor amplitudes Fcatc and phases (~.l:)- These were scaled to the observed amplitudes, Fobs, using the program SIMWT (Tickle, 1988). Difference Fourier maps with coefficients Fobs - Fcal¢ and 2Fobs - Fcal¢ were computed using the Scale values and displayed on an Evans and Sutherland PS300 graphics system using FRODO (Jones, 1978). Clear and contiguous electron density for the inhibitor made modelling straightforward with the exception of the C-terminal residue where the density is weak. The same is found for many inhibitors complexed with endothiapepsin. The resulting model of the enzyme complex was then subjected to stereochemically restrained least-squares refinement using the program RESTRAIN (Moss & Morffew, 1982; Haneef et al., 1985). Several cycles of rigid body refinement placed the molecules more precisely in the unit cell. Subsequently all atomic co-ordinates and isotropic temperature factors were refined by gradual inclusion of the high resolution reflections, initially to 1"8 A and later to 1"6 A. During the course of refinement the model was inspected by computing difference Fourier maps with coefficients 2Fobs-Fc.l¢ and Fobs-Fc,t¢. Conformations of the side-chains of some serine, threonine, lysine and other surface residues were remodelled and water molecules were gradually included to give a total of 322 in the final cycles of refinement. A comparison of the isotropic temperature factors of the inhibitor and those of the enzyme indicated that the inhibitor is present at unit occupancy. The refinement was concluded after 125 cycles of least-squares optimization when the final cycle had an r.m.s, shift in atomic co-ordinates of 0"008 A. The least-squares fitting programs XS1 and XS2, written by A. Sail applying the method described by McLachlan (1982), were used for pairwise superposition of molecules.

Stereo views of (a) the endothiapepsin molecule (C~ atoms only) and (b) its complex with the inhibitor. is a stereo view of the 2Fobs--Fcalc electron density of the inhibitor demonstrating the high quality and clarity of the map. The improved resolution of the data allowed better definition of some regions of the enzyme that are poorly defined in the native crystal structure, especially surface loops (see Fig. 3). The active site "flap" and the solvent molecules with which it interacts are more clearly defined than in the uncomplexed enzyme (Fig. 4). Elsewhere, nine of 11 lysine residues and the lone arginine have their side-chains well defined. Most of the aromatic rings have well-defined planes with central holes. (b) The general structure of the 1985, 1990). Figure 5 shows stereo views of the enzyme and of its complex with the inhibitor. The active site cleft is formed between the two lobes, each of which provides one of the essential aspartate residues. The inhibitor H-261 has an extended fl-strand conformation {Fig. 6) and makes hydrogen bonds throughout its main-chain to each lobe of the enzyme (Fig. 7). The side-chains make hydrogen bonds and van der Waals' interactions with both domains in the molecule so defining sub-sites $6, $5, $4, $3, $2, $1, S'I, S~ and S~ (Berger & Schechter, 1970). An antiparallel fl-hairpin comprising residues 71 to 82, known as the flap, interacts with the central region of the inhibitor and shields the active site from the solvent. The carboxylate groups of the active site aspartate residues form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl oxygen of the hydroxyethylene isostere of the inhibitor (Fig. 8). Although the carboxylates are coplanar in the uncomplexed enzyme, their planes are inclined to each other by about 30 ° in the complex due to steric interactions with the inhibitor. The carboxy-terminal His at P~ loops out into the solvent region. The conformational angles of the inhibitor H-261 are given in Table 2. The main-chain ¢ and ~bvalues of the inhibitor are in the E-sheet area of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 9). Side-chain conformational angles of the inhibitor are in the range of commonly observed values, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 9.

This gives rise to an antiparallel fl-pleated sheet between residues P3 to P1 of the inhibitor and one short stretch of residues from the C-terminal lobe of the enzyme, 219 to 217. An equivalent fl-sheet interaction with the N-terminal lobe would involve parallel strands if it existed, but only one hydrogen bond of this putative structure is formed involving P'2 N H and 34 CO. A similar pattern of hydrogen bonds is observed in other inhibitor-aspartic proteinase complexes (Bott et al., 1982; James et al., 1982; Foundling et al., 1987; Blundell et al., 1987; Suguna et al., 1987). The amide nitrogen of Ps has a bifurcated hydrogen bond with both the side-chain oxygen atoms of Aspl2, one of which also makes a further hydrogen bond with the main-chain CO of Ps. At the $3 sub-site the amide nitrogen of Ps makes a hydrogen bond with the side-chain oxygen atom of Thr219, and the main-chain CO forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogen of Thr219 and with a water molecule (Wl). The main-chain earbonyl oxygen and nitrogen of P2 are hydrogen-bonded to Asp77 NH and to water (W3), respectively. The P2 imidazole nitrogen N bl is hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain oxygen of Thr218. The transition state isostere is held by hydrogen bonds between the -CHOH-CH z- of the inhibitor and the residues of the conserved Asp-Thr-Gly regions and the flap (see Fig. 8). The hydroxyl group of the hydroxyethylene makes several close contacts with the catalytic aspartate residues and probably forms two hydrogen bonds at the pH of crystallization (pH 4"5). These may involve the sidechain O ~z oxygen atoms of Asp32 and Asp215, which show the shortest distances of 2"7 A. The carboxylate O ~2 oxygen atoms of the two aspartate residues are at distances of 3.2 and 3'1 A (Fig. 7). Hence, the inner earboxyl oxygen of Asp32 and the outer oxygen of Asp215 form the closest contacts with inhibitor OH group. The flap is held down by

four hydrogen bonds to the inhibitor. The amide nitrogen of Asp77 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of P2 and there exists a weaker hydrogen bond between the same carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of Gly76. The nitrogen of Gly76 is also hydrogen-bonded to the P'I carbonyl oxygen and Ser74 CO is hydrogen bonded to the amide nitrogen of P~. In addition to these flap interactions the amide nitrogen atoms of PI and P~ are hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly217 and Gly34 as noted above. Thus, the transition state isostere, the active site flap and the catalytic residues are very tightly hydrogen-bonded in an arrangement that provides a geometrically well-defined environment for stabilization of the transition state. (d) Water molecules and crystal contacts The crystal packing and interactions with water molecules differ from those of the native endothiapepsin crystal form. There are 41 internal water molecules, each defined by four or more hydrogen bonding contacts to the enzyme or to neighbouring water molecules and isotropic temperature factors less than 25/k ~. The inhibitor displaces 15 of the 20 water molecules occupying the active site of the uncomplexed enzyme. All polar side-chains of the enzyme that make hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor are also hydrogen-bonded to water molecules in the uncomplexed structure. The water molecule W2, which is bound between the carboxylate groups of the catalytic aspartate residues in the uncomplexed enzyme and may play the role of nucleophile during catalysis (Pearl & Blundell, 1984; Pearl, 1985; Blundell et al., 1987; Suguna et al., 1987), is displaced by the hydroxyl oxygen of the transition-state isostere (Fig. 8). Five of the 17 water molecules that form contacts with the inhibitor are hydrogen-bonded to it, and most are further bridged to the enzyme. The internal water molecule, W1, which is hydrogenbonded to the inhibitor and to the hydroxyl of Tyr222 also interacts with the loop comprising residues 284 to 294 through a network of water inolecules (P3 0-Wl-222 OH-W51-W53-W52-289 OH). W l also forms hydrogen bonds with the N H

functions of Thr219 and Leu220. Water molecule W3 forms a bridge between the inhibitor and the enzyme (P2 NH-W3-Asp77 Oal), whereas in other complexes such as the reduced bond peptide inhibitor bound to rhizopuspepsin (Suguna et al., 1987), and a pepstatin inhibitor bound to penicillopepsin (James & Sielecki, 1985), the hydrogen bond exists directly between the main-chain nitrogen of P2 and the oxygen of Asp77 side-chain with no intervening water molecule. In the endothiapepsin-H-261 complex reported here, this water network is extended from Asp77 through W54 to Serll0 O r. Further water-mediated networks involve P~ O-W2-W40-72 O, and P~ 0-W2-74 N. Such water-mediated hydrogen-bonded bridges may contribute towards the stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Figure 10 illustrates the crystal packing of the non-isomorphous crystal form adopted by the H-261 complex. Twelve symmetry-related molecules are found to be in contact with the reference molecule, seven of these form 34 possible hydrogen bonds, which are listed in Table 3. In addition, we have interpreted three solvent sites with much more density than usual as sulphate ions. These are on the surface of the molecule and take part in chargeassisted inter-molecular hydrogen bonding. Thus, there is an extensive network of water molecules, ions and inter-molecular interactions that results in the closer packing and lower solvent content of these crystals relative to the native crystal form.

(i) Sub-site S 6 The main-chain atoms of the t-Boc group (C-O-CO-) and the P5 (-NH-C~-) are co-planar. This is consistent with several small molecule structures (e.g. see Singh et al., 1987) and is probably due to steric effects of the lone pair orbitals on the alkyl oxygen, van der Waals' interactions are formed between the methyl groups of g-Boo and hydrophobic enzyme residues such as Leul0, Phe275 and Phe284, as well as the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues 276, 277 and 278 (Table 4). Homology considerations indicate that similar interactions involving Metl0 and Tyr275 may exist in complexes with human renin, although residue 284 is a threonine in renin rather than phenylalanine in endothiapepsin. (ii) Sub-site $5 The $5 sub-site, a shallow surface region of the N-terminal domain, is more polar than S~. It contains Aspl2, which lies centrally and is responsible for 18 of the 40 van der Waals' contacts and hydrogen bonds with P5 His. The histidyl sidechain of Ps is held by a continuous network of hydrogen bonds (P5 N61-W222-W136"80~1-12 062, 12 O6t-P 5 N). (iii) Sub-site S,~ This sub-site is continuous with $5 and $3, but extends into the C-terminal domain. ]?4 Pro makes a few close contacts involving the side-chains of Aspl2, Thr219 and Leu220. The conformational parameters P5 ~b and 1)4 ~b (Table 2) lead to a bend in the generally extended main-chain that matches the active site cleft. (iv) Sub-site S 3 P3 Phe has more contacts than any other inhibitor residue; it makes van der Waals' interactions with a number of hydrophobic residues, e.g. Ile7, Alal3, Ilell7 as well as the polar residues Aspl2 and Asp114. The phenyl ring of P3 adopts an orientation such that the carboxyl group of A s p l l 4 is close to the edge of the ring, so optimizing weak ionic interactions between the etectronegative oxygen and the C-H dipole of an aromatic ring

Residues that constitute the binding pockets of endothiapepsin were defined according to the distance (cut-off of 4"2 A) and accessible contact area. The quality of the final electron density map and other relevant details of these pockets are listed. Solvent accessible areas were calculated by the method described by Richmond & Richards (1978), using a solvent probe radius of 1"4 A. The assumption is made that the average inhibitor conformation in solution is the same as that of the complex.

(v) Sub-site $2 This is a large amphiphilic sub-site t h a t can a c c o m m o d a t e the side-chain of 1>2 in several different conformations.

T h e imidazole side-chain of 1>2 His is oriented t o w a r d s the S'I subsite, which is contiguous

I n other inhibitors the side-chain is often oriented towards P4, and in the CP69,799 complex the side-chain t a k e s up b o t h positions with a l m o s t equal o c c u p a n c y (Sail et al., 1989).

(ix) Sub-site S'3 P's His curls out into the solvent region interacting with several water molecules. This probably accounts for the more diffuse electron density of the histidine side-chain. Thus, sub-site residues defined by interaction with this inhibitor at P~ cannot contribute very much to the binding. It has been suggested that potent inhibitors like H-261 may interact in a different fashion at S~ of human renin so accounting for the specificity observed for P~ histidine in substrates (Sibanda et al., 1984). (f) Evidence for decrease in disorder and conformational change on ligand binding Figure 12 shows the mean isotropic temperature factors, Biso, for the main-chain of the free enzyme and the complex together with their differences, plotted against residue number. Although there may be systematic differences between the B-values of the enzyme and its complex due to different

hexylalanine side-chains at PI improve the inhibition constant for human renin significantly more than leucyl or phenyl side-chains (Boger et al., 1985). (vii) Sub-site S'I The S] sub-site is related to the $1 sub-site by the inter-lobe pseudo-2-fold axis (Blundell et al., 1990), and consequently resembles it in general disposition. It involves residues such as Ile213 of the C-terminal domain as well as residues of the flap including Tyr75 and Gly76. The sub-site is continuous with $2 and larger side-chains are known to be accommodated by interactions with I1e299 and Ile301 (e.g. see Cooper et al., 1987). (viii) Sub-site S'2 The S t sub-site is formed by residues Ile73, Ser74, Tyr75, Leu128, Thrl30 and Phe189. Water molecules are also present in spite of the hydrophobie side-chain of P~ Ile. This sub-site is shallow, but the isoleueine fills it well and makes multiple contacts with the enzyme (Table 4). Here the aromatic rings of Phe189 and Tyr75 are disposed on either side of the inhibitor main-chain.

The positions of equivalent side-chains of endothiapepsin with and without inhibitor were compared. The values within parentheses are the averaged values of the distances the residues have moved. The residues whose electron density were found to be disordered in the native structure are not taken into account.

resolutions, there are several areas where differences occur which may be due to the different crystal packing. These include (1)the loop comprised of residues 48 to 59; (2) the helix comprised of residues 108 to 114 and turn residues 115 to 117; (3)the loops 234 to 237 and 240 to 243 that follow helix 225 to 233; (4) the loop of residues 317 to 320. All of these surface regions are involved in inter-molecular contacts as shown in Table 3, and thus the decrease in the thermal factors in the complex may be a consequence of the different packing in the H-261 crystals. There arc several other regions where large decreases in thermal parameters occur. Most significant of these is the flap, 71 to 82, for which there is a decrease from 30 A 2 in the free enzyme to 8 A 2 in the complex for main-chain atoms only. Table 6 demonstrates that on complexation there is also a movement of residues of the flap (residues 73 to 79). The average C~ difference is about 1"0 A, with a maximum of about 1"3 A in the region of residues 77 to 79. However, there is a mean movement of only 0"6 A in the Tyr75 side-chain, which is the smallest movement in the loop. The decrease in isotropic temperature factor or "mobility" and the change in position of the flap are almost certainly a consequence of the interactions described above between the inhibitor and the enzyme. These differences in the position of the flap are smaller than those reported for penicillopepsin in its complex with an inhibitor (James et al., 1982). However, endothiapepsin, unlike penicillopepsin, has no intermolecular intercations involving the flap (residues 75 to 79), either in the free enzyme or in the complex. Thus, these results should be relatively unbiased by the specific crystal environment. The significant decrease in temperature factors of helix 108 to 114 may also have contributions from inhibitor binding (Sali et al., 1989) due to interactions between this helix and P3 of H-261 {Table 4). The mean Biso value of 34 A2 in the free enzyme is reduced to 14 A 2 in the complex. The carboxylate groups of Glu113 and A s p l l 4 move by

about 3"8 A and 2-8 A, respectively. It appears the flap and helix move together on complexation with the inhibitor. A comparison of Cffi positions using a difference distance matrix (for a review, see Richards & Kundrot, 1988) was made between the native and complexed endothiapepsin. The comparison revealed small but significant changes in the relative orientation of two rigid bodies, the first one comprising residues - 2 to 189, and 304 to 326, and the second one consisting of residues 190 to 303. For the H-261 complex the movement may be considered as a 4"2° rotation of the smaller carboxyterminal domain and a 0"25 A shift parallel to the rotation axis. This screw axis passes approximately through the C~ atoms of residues 22 and 213, and also through the active site aspartate residues. The effect also occurs with the H-261 complex when cocrystallized in the native-like crystal form. The relative rotation of 0"6° and the translation of (~16 A are in the same direction as those crystals reported here, but they are much smaller. We shall discuss the rigid body rotation in 20 inhibitor complexes of endothiapepsin in a separate publication (A. Sali et al., unpublished results). Clearly crystal packing plays a role but it is not the only factor.

(g) Factors affecting binding a~nity The solvent contact area of the free enzyme, calculated by the method described by Richmond & Richards {1978), decreases by 200 A2 on inhibitor binding; this corresponds to about 5 % of the total surface area. The inhibitor loses about 313 Sx of its 2 surface area, which corresponds to 68% of its total surface area, assuming that the average solution conformation is the same as the bound one. The central region of the inhibitor (-Leu-CHOH-CH2-Val-) is completely excluded from the solvent. Residues P6, P3, P2 and P~ also become largely inaccessible on binding to the enzyme {Table 4). The hydrophilicity of the pockets gradually increases on either side of the catalytic centre. Pockets $2, $1, S] and S~ are relatively hydrophobic, whereas pockets $4, $3 and S~ are more hydrophilic. This is reflected in the ratio of contacts involving carbon to those involving nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the sub-sites {Table 4). The free energy due to the hydrophobic effect plays an important part in the tight binding of the inhibitor. If it is assumed that burying 1 A 2 of the amino acid surface contributes approximately -0"4 kJ/mol to the free energy of the reaction (Chothia, 1974; Richmond & Richards, 1978), the contribution of the hydrophobic effect of inhibitor binding to the enzyme is --207 kJ/mol, but the experimentally determined total standard free energy of binding at 25°C is about - 5 1 kJ/mol. The difference between these two values includes contri= butions from the loss of entropy of the inhibitor, flap and many side-chains of the enzyme.

Comparison of the hydrogen bonds of various oligopeptide inhibitors reveals that there is an absolute conservation of the mode of binding of the main-chain of the inhibitor to the enzyme. Also, water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded in the active site cleft in the native enzyme are displaced on complexation and are replaced by hydrogen bonding donors or acceptors of the inhibitor. This replacement leads to a small free energy contribution of hydrogen bonding to the ligand binding (Fersht eta/., 1986). This suggests that the crucial role played by the conserved main-chain hydrogen bonds of the ligand is a precise alignment of the substrate with the catalytic residues of the enzyme (~ali et a/., 1989).
