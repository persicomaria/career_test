ABSTRACT: Internal loops in RNA are important for folding and function. Many folding motifs are internal loops containing GA base pairs, which are usually thermodynamically stabilizing, i.e., contribute favorable free energy to folding. Understanding the sequence dependence of folding stability and structure in terms of molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and base stacking, will provide a foundation for predicting stability and structure. Here, we report the NMR structure of the oligonucleotide 5GGUGGAGGCU3 duplex, 3PCCGAAGCCG5 (P ) purine), containing an unusually stable and relatively abundant internal 5GGA3 loop, 3AAG5. This loop contains three consecutive sheared GA pairs (trans Hoogsteen/Sugar edge AG) with separate stacks of three G's and three A's in a row. The thermodynamic consequences of various nucleotide substitutions are also reported. Significant destabilization of 2 kcal/mol at 37 °C is found for 5GAA3 substitution of the middle GA with AA to form 3AAG5. This destabilization correlates with a unique base 5GGA3 5UG3 5UG3 stacking and hydrogen-bonding network within the 3AAG5 loop. Interestingly, the motifs, 3GA5 and 3AA5, 5CG3 have stability similar to 3GA5 even though UG and UA pairs are usually less stable than CG pairs. 5GGA3 Consecutive sheared GA pairs in the 3AAG5 loop are preorganized for potential tertiary interactions and ligand binding.

RNA can fold into different secondary and tertiary structures for various functions. The increasing number of NMR and crystal structures of RNA and RNA-protein complexes have revealed new RNA-folding motifs (1-3). Many such motifs are internal loops that contain noncanonical base pairs such as GA and UU, which are usually thermodynamically stabilizing, i.e., contribute favorable free energy to folding (4). Predicting the sequence dependence of folding stability and structure for such loops is at an early stage, however (5-8). Understanding this sequence dependence in terms of detailed molecular recognition interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and base stacking, will provide a foundation for structural genomics of RNA. Here, we report the NMR structure of an oligonucleotide containing an 5GGA3 unusually stable internal loop, 3AAG5, which is found in the signal recognition particle (SRP)1 (9) and small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNAs (10-12). The thermodynamic consequences of various nucleotide substitutions are also reported. The oligonucleotide sequence studied mimics an internal loop found in the SRP of the

archaebacterium, Thermococcus celer (Figure 1) (9). It forms part of the Alu domain, which homology modeling (13, 14) suggests may form extensive tertiary contacts that allow it to substitute for the SRP9/14 protein found in eukaryotic SRPs (15-17). The Alu domain is involved in the elongation arrest of nascent peptide chains once the S domain binds the signal sequence of a protein. Elongation arrest is thought to allow efficient targeting by providing a time window for the translocation of signal sequence (15, 17). NMR spectra 5UGGAG3 of the 3GAAGC5 internal loop indicate that it is preorganized, which may facilitate formation of tertiary contacts important for function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligoribonucleotide Synthesis and Purification. Oligoribonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer using the phosphoramidite method (18, 19). CPG support and phosphoramidites were acquired from Glen Research or ChemGenes. Base-protecting groups and CPG support were removed by incubation in 3:1 (v/v) ammonia/ethanol at 55 °C overnight (20). A disposable filter column was used to separate the oligonucleotides from solid support. Removal of the silyl-protecting groups on the 2 hydroxyls was achieved by incubation in 9:1 (v/v) TEA,

Chen et al. The equation G°37 ) H° - (310.15)S° was used to calculate the free energy change at 37 °C (310.15 K). NMR Sample Preparation. Sample preparation was similar to Znosko et al. (27) with minor modification. The 300 µL sample was dialyzed overnight against 1 L of distilled water in a Gibco Life Technologies microdialysis system with a 1000 MW cutoff Spectro-Por #7 dialysis membrane and a Rainin Dynamax peristaltic pump. The sample was then lyophilized and redissolved in 80 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 0.5 mM Na2EDTA at pH ) 5.9. Total volume was 300 µL with 90:10 (v:v) H2O/D2O for exchangeable proton spectra. D2O exchange was performed with lyophilization 3 times from 99.96% D2O and finally dissolved in 300 µL of 99.996% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). The total duplex concentration was 2 mM. NMR Spectroscopy. Unless otherwise noted, all exchangeable and nonexchangeable proton spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. One-dimensional imino proton spectra were acquired with an S pulse sequence with a sweep width of 12 kHz and temperatures ranging from 0 to 55 °C. SNOESY spectra were recorded with a 150 ms mixing time at 0, 5, 30, and 40 °C. The spectra were acquired with 2k complex points and a spectral width of 10 kHz. A total of 300 FIDs were accumulated with 72 scans per FID and recycle delay of 1.2 s. The FELIX (2000) software package (Molecular Simulations Inc.) was used to process 2D spectra. Proton spectra were referenced to H2O or HDO at a known temperature-dependent chemical shift relative to 3-(trimethylsilyl)tetradeutero sodium propionate (TSP). NOESY spectra of samples in D2O were acquired at 30 °C with 100, 200, 300, 400, and 600 ms mixing times. The spectra were acquired with 2k complex points and a spectral width of 4200 Hz. A total of 360 FIDs were acquired with 32 scans per FID and recycle delay of 2.8 s. TOCSY spectra were acquired at 30 °C with 8, 20, and 40 ms mixing times. The spectra were acquired with a spectral width of 4000 Hz with 2k complex points or with a spectral width of 1700 Hz with 1k complex points. A total of 256-512 FIDs were acquired with 24-64 scans per FID. The natural abundance 1 H-13C HMQC spectrum was acquired with a 5000 Hz spectral width for proton and 15 000 Hz spectral width for carbon. The HMQC spectrum consisted of 60 increments each having 1k complex points with 512 scans per FID. The natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC spectrum was acquired with a 6000 Hz spectral width for proton and 9000 Hz spectral width for carbon on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer. The HSQC spectrum consisted of 64 increments each having 1k complex points with 700 scans per FID. The inversion recovery method was used to measure T1 relaxation times for base protons. A 1D 31P spectrum of the D2O sample was acquired at 30 °C on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer. The 1H-31P HETCOR spectrum was acquired with a 1400 Hz spectral width for proton and 2000 Hz for 31P. The 31 P chemical shifts were referenced to the phosphate buffer at 0 ppm. Restraint Generation. NOESY cross-peak volumes were integrated with FELIX (2000). Distance restraints were generated from 100 and 200 ms mixing time NOE volumes at 30 °C with the average volume of all pyrimidine (C and U) H5-H6 cross peaks as a reference (2.45 Å). All other distances were calculated from the two-spin approximation, scaling by 1/r6. The upper and lower bounds were set to

3HF (triethylamine trihydrofluoride)/DMF (N,N-dimethyl formamide) at 55 °C for 2 h, followed by 1-butanol precipitation. The sample was lyophilized before redissolving in 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 7. The solution was loaded onto a Waters Sep-Pak C18 chromatography column to remove excess salts. The oligonucleotide was purified by TLC on a preparative Baker Si500F silica gel plate (20 × 20 cm, 500 µm thick), with the running solution of 55:35: 10 (v/v/v) 1-propanol/ammonia/water. For G-rich sequences, the running solution was 50:40:10 (v/v/v) 1-propanol/ ammonia/water. The product was identified by UV shadowing and scraped from the plate. RNA was extracted from the silica with distilled water. The Sep-Pak procedure was repeated to desalt the sample. The mass of all oligonucleotides was verified by ESI MS with a Hewlett-Packard 1100 LC/MS Chemstation. Purities were checked by reverse-phase HPLC or analytical TLC on a Baker Si500F silica gel plate (250 µm thick), and all were greater than 95% pure. UV Melting Experiments and Thermodynamics. Concentrations of single-stranded oligonucleotides were calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm at 80 °C and extinction coefficients predicted from those of dinucleotide monophosphates and nucleosides (21). Purine (P) was assumed to be the same as adenine for approximation of extinction coefficients. Small mixing errors for nonself-complementary duplexes do not affect thermodynamic measurements appreciably (22). Oligonucleotides were lyophilized and redissolved in 1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM disodium EDTA at pH 7.0. Curves of absorbance at 280 nm versus temperature were acquired using a heating rate of 1 °C/min with a Beckman Coulter DU640C spectrophotometer having a high performance temperature controller cooled with flowing water. Melting curves were fit to a two-state model with MeltWin, assuming linear sloping baselines and temperatureindependent H° and S° (23-25). Additionally, the temperature at which half the strands are in duplex, TM, at total strand concentration, CT, was used to calculate thermodynamic parameters according to (26)

(30% of each distance to allow for potential errors because of spin diffusion, spectrum noise, and distortions of phasing and baseline. Restraints of overlapped peaks were loosened or discarded. For some weak peaks and SNOESY peaks, loosened upper bounds were used. No restraints from H5 or H5 were used. A total of 197 interproton distance restraints (101 intranucleotide and 96 internucleotide) (Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information), 15 hydrogen-bond restraints (limiting proton and hydrogen-bond acceptor distances within 1.8-2.5 Å) for 5 Watson-Crick GC pairs, and 102 dihedral angle restraints were included. No hydrogenbond restraints were used within the loop and GU pair. Because 31P chemical shifts are within (0.7 ppm, which is typical for A-form RNA (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), backbone dihedral restraints were used. Dihedral angles of residues in the Watson-Crick stems and GU pair were loosely restrained: R (0 ( 120°), (180 ( 30°),  (60 ( 30°),  (85 ( 30°), (-140 ( 40°), (0 ( 120°), and (-170 ( 40°). For loop residues (G4, G5, A6, G14, A15, and A16), only the  and dihedral angles were restrained. Dihedral angle constraints for  were obtained from TOCSY and DQF-COSY spectra. G5 was restrained to be the C2-endo conformation with  (160 ( 30°); A6, G14, and the two 3-dangling residues, U10 and P20, were restrained to cover both the C2-endo and C3-endo conformations with  (122.5 ( 67.5°). G4, A15, and A16 were restrained to be the C3-endo conformation with  (85 ( 30°). Glycosidic bond dihedral angles, 's, were loosely restrained (-120 ( 90°) because there was no indication of a syn conformation, which would be indicated by a strong intraresidue H1-H8/H6 cross peak comparable in intensity to the H5-H6 cross peaks. Structure Calculation. NMR-restrained molecular dynamics and energy minimization was done with the Discover 98 package on a Silicon Graphics computer. An A-form like RNA starting structure was generated with the Biopolymer

module of Insight II (2000). Partial charges of the purine 3-dangling end are the same as previously reported (28). The AMBER 95 force field (29) was used with addition of flat-bottom restraint pseudopotentials, with force constants of 25 kcal/(mol Å2) for NOE distance restraints and 50 kcal/ (mol rad2) for torsion-angle restraints and with a maximum force of 1000 kcal/mol. Group-based summation with an 18 Å cutoff was used for calculating van der Waals interactions. The cell-multipole method, with a distance-dependent dielectric constant ( ) 2r), was used for calculating electrostatic interactions. The progression of the structure simulation was (27, 30) (1) covalent bond energy, NOE, and dihedral angle constraints scaled to 100%, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions scaled to 0 and 1%, respectively; (2) 500 steps of steepest descent energy minimization; (3) 4 ps of restrained molecular dynamics with 1 fs time steps at 1000 K; (4) 2 ps rMD at 900 K; (5) 2 ps rMD at 800 K; (6) increase van der Waals and electrostatic interactions to 33%; (7) 2 ps rMD at 700 K; (8) increase van der Waals and electrostatic interactions to 67%; (9) 2 ps rMD at 600 K; (10) increase van der Waals and electrostatic interactions to 100%; (11) 2 ps rMD at 500 K; (12) 2 ps rMD at 400 K; (13) 2 ps rMD at 300 K; and (14) 40 000 steps of conjugategradient energy minimization. Only one starting structure was used because the rMD at 1000 K effectively randomizes the structure. A total of 33 of 40 modeled structures were very similar and selected for analysis. RESULTS Thermodynamics. Thermodynamic parameters for several duplexes and internal loops at 1 M NaCl are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Throughout the paper, each top strand is written from 5 to 3 as going from left to right. Results GGUGGAGGCU for PCCGAAGCCG in 1 M NaCl and in 0.15 M KCl, 10 mM Mg2+ were the same within experimental error (Table 1).

a Experimental errors for G°37, H°, and S° for the canonical stems are estimated as 4, 12, and 13.5%, respectively, according to ref 25. There is less error in comparisons between these sequences because the stems are either identical or different by only one or two base pairs. Values in parentheses are predicted according to ref 5. b Nearest-neighbor parameters (25, 32) are used to estimate the difference of one or two base pairs compared to the measured core helix in Table 1.

Thermodynamic parameters for formation of the internal loops (Table 2) are calculated according to the following equation (31):

G°37,loop ) G°37(duplex with loop) G°37(duplex without loop) + G°37(interrupted base stack) (2a)
For example,
5UGGAG3 5GGUGGAGGCU3 G°37 (3GAAGC5 ) ) G°37 (3PCCGAAGCCG5 ) 5GGUGGCU3 5UG3 G°37 (3PCCGCCG5 ) + G°37 (3GC5 ) (2b)
5GGUGGAGGCU3 Here, G°37 (3PCCGAAGCCG5 ) is the measured value of the duplex containing the internal loop (Table 1), G°37 5GGUGGCU3 (3PCCGCCG5 ) is the measured value of the duplex without 5UG3 the loop (Table 1), and G°37 (3GC5 ) is the free energy increment for the nearest-neighbor base-stack interaction interrupted by the internal loop (25, 32). Identical calculations can be done for H°loop and S°loop. All of the thermodynamic parameters used in this calculation are derived from TM-1 versus ln(CT/4) plots (eq 1). All of the H° values from TM-1 versus ln(CT/4) plots and from the average of the fits of melting curves to two-state transitions agree within 11% (Table 1), suggesting that the two-state model is a good approximation for these transitions. Optical melting studies GGUGGAGGCU of the individual strands for PCCGAAGCCG in 1 M NaCl showed that the free energies for the formation of homoduplexes are at least 2 kcal/mol less favorable at 37 °C than for the heteroduplex (data not shown). Moreover, the NMR GGUGGAGGCU spectra for PCCGAAGCCG reveal the expected duplex structure, and the 1D imino proton spectra as a function of the temperature provide no indication of significant concentrations of intermediate states (see below and Figure 2). Exchangeable Proton Assignments. NMR spectra were GGUGGAGGCU measured for the duplex, PCCGAAGCCG , which mimics the sequence formed in helix 5 of T. celer SRP (Figure 1). The

One-dimensional imino 1H NMR spectra of at various temperatures. Imino proton resonances are assigned in the bottom spectrum. FIGURE 2:
GGUGGAGGCU PCCGAAGCCG

1D imino proton spectra at variable temperatures (Figure 2) reveal that, with the possible exception of G14, the internal loop structure melts at about the same temperature as the canonical base pairs. The weak peak resonating at 13.5 ppm is probably due to a minor conformation involving G2 and/ or G11 imino protons (Figure 2). Imino proton spectra of each individual strand show no peak at 13.5 ppm. The SNOESY spectrum (Figure S2) confirms the secondary structure and helps assign G imino, C amino, and C H5/H6 protons. G and A amino proton peaks are usually not observable because of intermediate exchange by rotation. Some unassigned peaks in the SNOESY spectrum are probably due to G or A amino protons in this uniquely

structured loop. U3H3 and G17H1 are overlapped at 5 °C but separate above 30 °C (Figure 2). G4H1 was assigned by the weak NOE to U3H3. G5H1 and G14H1 were assigned following the cross peaks G4H1-G5H1 and G5H1-G14H1. The imino proton of the 3-dangling U10 is observable at 10.9 ppm, probably because of the slower exchange rate with water at pH 5.9 compared with the pH 6.5-6.8 used in previous NMR studies (27, 28). Nonexchangeable Proton Assignments. NMR resonances were assigned essentially as described previously (27, 28, 33, 34). The (H8/H6/H2)-(H1/H5) "NOESY walk" region of the 400 ms NOESY spectrum at 30 °C is shown in Figure 3. The 3-dangling P20 with characteristic downfield chemical shifts of H8/H6/H2/H1 helps initiate the "walk" (28, 35). The G7H1 and G17H1 were shifted upfield to 4.21 and 4.75 ppm, respectively, and were confirmed by a natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC spectrum (Figure S3). Strong cross peaks resulting from H5-H6 (2.45 Å), H1-H2 (2.8-3.0 Å), and H1-H3 (3.5-4.0 Å) protons are important for assignments. Five characteristic H5-H6 cross peaks in the NOESY walk region and corresponding spin diffusion cross peaks to C amino protons and G imino protons in the SNOESY spectrum confirmed the formation of 5 WatsonCrick GC pairs within different nearest-neighbor environments. The H2 and H3 peaks were assigned from strong cross peaks to H1 resonances and were reconfirmed by the strong to medium sequential cross peaks (n)H8/H6 - (n 1)H2/H3. TOCSY (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), DQF-COSY (data not shown), and 1H-31P HETCOR (data not shown) spectra were also used to facilitate sugar proton assignments. The assignment of adenine H2 protons, which usually relax slowly because they are relatively spatially isolated, was facilitated by measurement of base proton T1 relaxation times (data not shown). A natural abundance 1H-13C HMQC spectrum (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) confirmed the AH2 assignments. All of the assignments are listed in Table S3 in the Supporting Information. GGUGGAGGCU Structural Features. The structure of the PCCGAAGCCG duplex was modeled from distance and dihedral angle restraints derived from the NMR spectra. The superposition

of 30 structures shown in Figure 4 demonstrates that the structure is well-defined. The average root-mean-square deviation of all selected 33 structures to the average structure for heavy atoms and all atoms are 0.66 ( 0.10 and 0.69 ( 0.10 Å, respectively. The average number of distance restraint violations is 4 ( 2. Only 6 of 33 selected structures have violations greater than 0.1 Å. Violations that were >0.1 Å are only for G14H8-G14H2 (NMR distance of 2.7 Å), which is due to the G14 sugar pucker being C3-endo in modeled structures, instead of being populated between C3endo and C2-endo conformations as indicated by intermediate scalar coupling of 5 Hz for G14 H1-H2 (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). No distance or dihedral-angle restraint violations were greater than 0.20 Å or 2°, respectively. UGGAG The structure of the GAAGC loop contains a standard GU wobble pair (cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick) and three sheared GA pairs [trans Hoogsteen/Sugar edge AG (36)]. Within the three consecutive sheared GA pairs, intra- and cross-strand stacking are adopted, resulting in the stacking pattern in the loop: G4/G5/G14 and A6/A15/A16 (Figures 5 and 6). Detailed hydrogen bonds within the loop are shown in Figure 7 and Table 3. The 3-dangling ends, U10 and P20, stack against the stem terminal base pairs. Thermodynamic Stabilization by 3-Dangling Ends Correlates with the Modeled NMR Structure. The 3-dangling P and uridine stabilize the duplex by 1.3 and 1.1 kcal/mol, respectively, at 37 °C in 1 M NaCl buffer (35, 37, 38), which is favorable for NMR studies at 30 °C in NMR buffer (27, 28, 39, 40). A preliminary TOCSY spectrum for the duplex without 3-dangling ends showed more H5-H6 cross peaks than expected, suggesting dynamics between multiple con-

formations. The U10 3-dangling end stacked on C9 with favorable overlap of the U10 carbonyl group, O4, and C9 amino groups, which is similar to previous NMR (27, 28, 37) and X-ray structures (37, 41-43).

Three GA Pairs up to 50 °C in 1D imino proton spectra (Figure 2), suggesting that they are both tightly hydrogen-bonded; (4) the SNOESY spectrum at 30 °C (data not shown), suggesting that both U3H3 and G17H1 show an NOE to a pair of unassigned amino protons, which we speculate as G17 amino protons. On the basis of the relative intensities of these pairs of cross peaks at 30 °C, G17H1 was assigned further upfield than U3H3; and (5) The U3H3-G17H1 cross peak, which is observable at 40 °C (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). One of the G17 amino protons is potentially hydrogenbonded to the G4O4 as shown in modeled structures (Figure 7 and Table 3), which is in agreement with the observed pair of chemical shifts (6.37 and 5.42 ppm) for G17 amino protons (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Three ConsecutiVe Sheared GA Pairs Correlate with NMR Spectra. Sheared pairs of G4A16 and G14A6 are confirmed by (1) medium cross-strand cross peaks of G7H1-G14H1 and G17H1-G4H1 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information); (2) medium cross peaks of A16H2-G17H1 and A6H2G7H1 (data not shown), which bring the Watson-Crick edges of A16 and A6 to the minor groove; and (3) upfield chemical shifts of G7H1 and G17H1 to 4.21 and 4.75 ppm (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), respectively. An upfield chemical shift for the H1 of the residue 3 to a sheared purine-purine pair is common (27, 28, 44-51). This upfield chemical shift may be explained by empirical modeling of the ring current of adenosine above the H1 proton of the 3 residue, which is in agreement with quantum mechanical calculations and molecular modeling (52, 53). Cross-strand stacking between two sheared GA pairs of G5A15 and A6G14 is confirmed by the medium strength cross peaks, A15H2-A6H1 and A6H2-A15H1 (Figure 3), and G5H1-G14H2. Several weak cross peaks of A15H2A6H8, A15H2-A16H2 (data not shown), and G5H1-G14H1 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) also indicate crossstrand stacking of the adjacent sheared GA pairs. G4H2 is above the aromatic ring of G5, which correlates with its unusual upfield chemical shift of 3.61 ppm. A15H2 has a relatively upfield chemical shift of 7.13 ppm, which also correlates with the stacking pattern shown in Figure 5 because A15H2 experiences ring currents from A16 and A6 bases. Interestingly, at various temperatures, the G4H1 peak is always sharper than that of G14H1 (Figure 2), which is consistent with the modeled structure: more extensive stacking of U3/G4/G5 than C13/G14/G5 (Figure 5) and the stronger "cross-step" hydrogen bond expected between G4H1 and a nonbridging phosphate oxygen between G14 and A15 as compared to that between G14H1 and the G5 2-hydroxyl oxygen (54) (Figure 7 and Table 3). The dynamic character of G14 is also shown by the intermediate scalar coupling of H1-H2 (5 Hz) in TOCSY (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) and DQF-COSY (data not shown) spectra, which indicate that the sugar pucker of G14 is populated in both C2-endo and C3-endo conformations. Broad doublet peaks for A6H1 in NOESY and a missing cross peak for G5H3-A6P in a HETCOR spectrum (data not shown) also indicate that the G14A6 region is dynamic on the NMR time scale. DISCUSSION

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 8, 2005 2851

The constantly expanding databases of RNA sequences contain a huge amount of information. Understanding relationships between sequence, energetics, structure, and function can facilitate rapid extraction of this information. The internal loop is a common RNA motif where such relationships are not fully understood. The results of this study provide insights into relationships between sequence, energetics, and structure for an unusually stable 3 × 3 internal loop, GGA, which is relatively abundant in known AAG secondary structures and likely important for function (5, 9, 12-14, 55-57). Molecular Recognition and Thermodynamics. The comparison between measured and predicted (in parentheses) values of G°37,loop in Table 2 shows that GGA and GAA AAG AAG internal loops are more stable than expected. The NMR UGGAG structure presented here is for the natural loop, GAAGC . Surprisingly, replacement of the U with C destabilizes this loop by 0.4 kcal/mol at 37 °C (Figure 1 and Table 2). This compares with a predicted stabilization of 0.8 kcal/mol, assuming a GU pair closing a loop is equivalent to an AU pair (4, 5, 8). This correlates with more extensive stacking of UG than CG (Figure 5) and a hydrogen bond between the GA GA G17 amino group and G4O4 (Figure 7 and Table 3) in the NMR structure. Enhanced stability for a UG nearest-neighGA bor interaction is also suggested by the observation that GGUGGAGGCU replacement of the internal loop closing C in PCCGAAGCCG with a closing U destabilizes the loop by only 0.1 kcal/mol, rather than the predicted 0.8 kcal/mol (4, 5, 8). The subtle difference between the two closing base pairs for the GGA AAG loop might be due to the sequence asymmetry of the internal loop, e.g., different sugar pucker for G4 and G14 (Figure 7) and/or the different canonical stems in the NMR construct, GGUGGAGGCU , i.e., different stacking interactions for GU and CG PCCGAAGCCG the CG replacement GC compared with CC and the UG CG GG replacement CU (24, 25, 32, 58). As shown in Figure 5, the GG GUGGA region is characterized by an extensive overlap of CGAAG bases. In sequence symmetric 2 × 2 loops, which have two identical nearest-neighbor interactions involving closing canonical pairs with sheared GA pairs, the UG motif is also GA somewhat more stable than expected. In particular, UGAG GAGU (0.1 kcal/mol) is more stable than UGAA (0.7 kcal/mol) (4, 8, AAGU CGAG 59) but less stable than GAGC (-0.7 kcal/mol) (4, 8, 45). UG Evidently, the GA motif is unusually stable, which correlates with its frequent occurrence in ribosomal RNA (59, 60). Interestingly, an A+C wobble pair (cis Watson-Crick/ Watson-Crick), with AN1 protonated is isosteric with a GU wobble pair, and geometric compatibility has previously been reported between an A+C wobble pair and sheared GA pair CCGAG in a 3 × 3 internal loop, GAAGC (50, 51). A similar stacking pattern is seen for an AC wobble pair adjacent to a sheared GCAAC AA pair (shown in bold) within the J4/5 loop, CAAAG, of a group I intron in complex with both the 5 and 3 exons (61). GGUGGAGGCU Replacement of the loop middle G with A in PCCGAAGCCG and several variants destabilizes the loop by 2 kcal/mol at 37 °C (Figure 1 and Table 2), which is a significantly larger effect than predicted by the bonus parameter of -1.2 kcal/ mol for a middle GA pair adjacent to at least one non-

2852 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 8, 2005 pyrimidine-pyrimidine pair and  -1 kcal/mol for a loopterminal GA pair (4, 5). Extra stabilization by a GA middle pair was also found in other 3 × 3 loops with three consecutive GA pairs (5). This dramatic stabilization correlates with favorable stacking and hydrogen bonding within this internal loop (Figures 5 and 7 and Table 3). In particular, a central AA pair is not expected to form the many hydrogen bonds shown for the central GA pair in Figure 7. As indicated in Figure 7, the G4 sugar adopts a predominant C3-endo (N) sugar pucker, while G5 adopts a predominant C2-endo (S) sugar pucker (JH1-H2  8 Hz). The G14 sugar populates both sugar puckers as indicated by H1H2 coupling of 5 Hz. The base-backbone hydrogen bonds UGGAG in the NMR structure of the loop GAAGC include G4 (2-hydroxyl)-A16 (amino), G5 (2-hydroxyl)-G14 (amino/ imino), G5 (amino)-A15 (nonbridging oxygen), and A6 (amino)-G14 (2-hydroxyl) (Figure 7 and Table 3). These hydrogen-bonding patterns are similar to previously reported guanosine sugar-pucker-dependent hydrogen-bonding patterns of tandem sheared GA pairs (50). G imino and amino groups are close in space; thus, they could potentially share the same hydrogen-bond acceptors from the opposite backbone, perhaps mediated by water. Potential hydrogen bonds of G5O4-A15 amino and a "cross-step" hydrogen bond of G4 amino/imino-A15 nonbridging oxygen are also observed in this structure. The formation of a "cross-step" hydrogen bond possibly stabilizes the backbone kink between G14 and A15. Similar hydrogen bonding was observed in a crystal CGGAAG structure of a related loop, GAAGGC (62). Thermodynamic studies of 2 × 2 loops provide the GAAG following stability increments at 37 °C (32, 63): CAAC , 0.5 GAAG GGAG kcal/mol; CAGC , -0.2 kcal/mol; CAAC , -0.3 kcal/mol; and GGAG , -1.7 kcal/mol. These values also suggest the imporCAGC tance of hydrogen bonding for the stabilities of tandem GA pairs (63). On the basis of isostericity matrixes (36), a sheared AA pair is expected to stack similar to a GA pair, although a GA pair is expected to have more hydrogen bonds. Consistent with these expectations, previous structural and thermodynamic studies showed that the destabilizing 2 × 2 CAAG loop GAAC (1.2 kcal/mol) with two sheared AA pairs has similar stacking geometries but fewer hydrogen bonds than CGAG (-0.7 kcal/mol) with two sheared GA pairs (4, 27, 45, GAGC 64). The large effects associated with changing a GA to AA pair in 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 loops provide benchmarks for testing approaches such as free-energy perturbation and molecular dynamics (65, 66), which attempt to make predictions of the sequence dependence of stability and structure. Understanding the interactions determining the sequence dependence of stability can facilitate prediction of secondary and threedimensional structures from sequence (32). UGGAG Dynamics. In the GAAGC loop, UG is more rigid than CG GA GA because of the stacking and hydrogen bonding discussed above. Significantly lower occurrence of hydrogen bonds of G (N3)-A (amino) (Figure 7) for G14A6 and G5A15 reflect dynamics as compared to G4A16 (Table 3). The missing cross peak of G5H3-A6P suggests dynamics of the backbone, which is similar to those observed previously in the CCGAG loop GAAGC (50). Different orientations and detailed hydrogen-bonding patterns were also observed in different duCGAG plexes in the crystal structure of the loop, GAGC, which had

Chen et al. 2.5 duplexes in an asymmetric unit. This also suggests intrinsic dynamic features for sheared GA pairs in a CG GA motif in an internal loop (64). NMR studies of CGNRAG tetra-loop hairpins also reveal dynamics for the GA in a CG GA motif (49). Evidently, CG is an inherently dynamic motif. GA Sequence- and Context-Dependent Structures of GA Pairs. The NMR structure of the GGA internal loop provides AAG insights useful for modeling of local three-dimensional structure. In general, formation of sheared GA pairs is accompanied by narrowing of the backbone 5 of A and 3 of G (67). This narrowing prohibits formation of a WatsonCrick pair 5 of the A in a sheared GA pair. Thus, single GA pairs flanked by Watson-Crick pairs have never been observed in a sheared conformation but usually are observed in an imino conformation (cis Watson-Crick/WatsonCrick) (55, 68) and less frequently in an A+G cis WatsonCrick/Hoogsteen conformation (69, 70). Previously, sheared GA's in size symmetric internal loops have only been observed as sequence symmetric pairs, i.e., as GA (45, 48, AG 64) or GGAA (62). The only previous structure with a 3 × 3 AAGG internal loop of consecutive GA pairs is in the crystal structure of Deinococcus radiodurans LSU rRNA (57). Helix UGGAG 68 of that structure contains a AAAGC loop that has only one sheared GA pair (shown in bold), with the rest of the loop bases not forming hydrogen-bonded pairs. The NMR strucUGGAG ture of the GAAGC loop reported here shows that it is possible to have an odd number of consecutive sheared GA pairs. It is possible that the UG closing base pair is a requirement for this motif. Alternatively, nonnearest-neighbor effects, the complex packing interactions, and/or difficulties in solving a large crystal structure may explain the structure UGGAG reported for the AAAGC loop in D. radiodurans (57). While this is the first report of an odd number of consecutive sheared GA pairs in a size symmetric (i.e., 3 × 3) internal loop containing only GA pairs, this motif has been previously observed in crystals having the loop, GGAU (55, AAGU 56), and in size asymmetric internal loops with a kink-turn motif (71, 72). Biochemical and biophysical studies of the GGGA GC kink-turn motif, e.g., CAAGAAGCG (kt-7), suggest that the three consecutive sheared GA pairs (shown in bold) in the asymmetric internal loop are structured in solution even in the absence of Mg2+ and protein (73). This is consistent with GGUGGAGGCU the similar thermodynamic stabilities of PCCGAAGCCG in 1 M NaCl and in 0.15 M KCl with 10 mM Mg2+ (Table 1). GGGA GC Formation of the three sheared GA pair motif in CAAGAAGCG (kt-7) (71) instead of the imino hydrogen-bonded GA pairs usually found for the GG motif (74, 75) indicates the CA favorable thermodynamics and function of three consecutive sheared GA pairs as a preorganized tertiary and proteinbinding site. This is similar to the formation of a sheared GA pair in a GG motif in thermodynamically stable and CA functionally important GGNRAC tetraloops (1-3). The UGGAA CG sequence GAAGGACG (kt-58) with four potential GA pairs has only three sheared GA pairs (shown in bold) to facilitate UGGA C the kink-turn (71). The sequences, GAAGGUAG (kt-46) and UGGA G (kt-78), are well-conserved to have three GA GAAGUUUC pairs and a UG closing base pair in LSU rRNA (12, 71, 72). Interestingly, the asymmetric 3 × 4 internal loop

in helix 5 of human SRP RNA, which is at a UGGAG position similar to that of the loop GAAGC in T. celer SRP (9), is predicted to have a kink-turn structure because it has the motif of tandem GA pairs in a size asymmetric loop (71). This loop is very important for the Alu domain folding as suggested by a low-resolution crystal structure and biochemical methods (16). Functional Implications. Smooth N1-C2-N3 edges of three UGGAG A's in the shallow minor groove of GAAGC (Figure 8) provide a helix-packing site with an A-minor motif (1-3, 55, 71, 76, 77) and a potential protein-binding site (16, 71, UGGAAG 78). Interestingly, there is a 4 × 4 loop GAAGGC in helix 5 of T. celer SRP RNA (Figure 1) (9), which might also be involved in tertiary interactions facilitating the folding of the Alu domain. A search of known RNA secondary structures containing 1079 3 × 3 internal loops (5, 10-12) reveals that 20% of 3 × 3 loops have a middle GA pair and 4% have a GGA AAG motif. If 3 × 3 loop sequences were random, then only 12.5% would have a middle GA pair and 0.05% would be GGA. AAG In eukaryal SSU rRNA, the GGA motif is well-conserved in AAG helix 44, with some variations to GGA, GA, or GA. The AAA AG AA corresponding helix packing partner, helix 13 [according to the crystal structure of bacterial 30S rRNA of T. thermophilus GGGAGC (55)] is well-conserved as CCAUCG (12). Occurrences of the UGGAG loop are found in helix 41a of 16S rRNA from GAAGC bacteria including Allochromatium Vinosum, Haemophilus influenzae, Heliobacterium chorum, Legionella pneumophila, Leptonema illini, Listeria monocytogenes, Methylobacterium sp., Methylococcus capsulatus, Petrotoga miotherma, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Thermomicrobium roseum (12). Helix 41a is involved in tertiary interactions with helix 41 CGGAUU (55). In helix 42, a well-structured 4 × 4 loop, GAAGUA (conserved in SSU rRNA (12)), with three consecutive

A GAC C UAGGAG

sheared GA pairs and a UU pair, is involved in tertiary contacts with helix 30, which has a conserved GGA as shown CAU in the crystal structure of 30S rRNA of T. thermophilus (55). UGGAU In LSU rRNA, AAAGU is also well-conserved in helix 2 (12) and involved in tertiary contacts with helix 26 (56, 57, 77). As shown in Figure 9, the superposition of the three GUGGAUU consecutive sheared GA pairs in UAAAGUA from helix 2 and GGGA GC (kt-7) of H. marismortui LSU rRNA to one of CAAGAAGCG UGGAG the NMR structures determined for GAAGC shows that the GGA motif is largely independent of sequence and structural AAG contexts. Evidently, motifs with the potential for three consecutive sheared GA pairs are energetically stable and provide likely sites for tertiary interactions such as helix packing. Other GGA motifs in the crystals mentioned above AAG are similar. Both GA imino and GU wobble pairs have their G amino groups projected into the minor groove, which is ideal for an A-minor motif interaction (71, 76, 77). A single GA pair at position -5 in the P1 helix of a Candida albicans group I intron is a recognition element for helix docking, and biochemical studies show that GU can substitute for this GA pair (79, 80). In the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, there is a GU pair at position -5 of P1 and binding measurements suggest that it may also favor helix docking relative to substitution with a GC pair (81). The internal loop, UGGGAG J5b/5c, in the C. albicans intron has the sequence, GAAA C, which can potentially form sheared GA pairs. Thus, this may provide another example of an A-minor motif tertiary interaction. Packing between an imino GA pair or a wobble GU pair and consecutive sheared GA pairs might be commonly used in the folding of many RNAs. Thus, improved understanding of the sequence dependence of their energetics may facilitate prediction of three-dimensional as well as secondary structure. GGUGGAGGCU In the PCCGAAGCCG duplex studied here, three G's in the loop as well as U3 are stacked in a row, exposing carbonyl groups and GN7's with highly negative potentials in the deep major groove (Figures 6 and 8), thus also providing potential metal ion (78, 82-85), protein (71), and small molecule (86,

2854 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 8, 2005 87) binding sites. The lack of significant dynamics indicates that this binding site is preorganized and thus would favor tight binding. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
