We report a set of three 1.8­1.9 Å resolution X-ray crystal structures of Neisseria gonorrhoeae Fbp (ferric-ion binding protein): (i) open-cleft apo-Fbp containing bound phosphate, (ii) opencleft mono-Fe Fbp capped by nitrilotriacetate, and (iii) open-cleft trinuclear oxo-iron Fbp, the first structure of an iron-cluster adduct of a transferrin. The nine independent molecules in the unit cells provide `snapshots' of the versatile dynamic structural

roles of the conserved dityrosyl iron-binding motif (Tyr195 -Tyr196 ) which control the capture and, possibly, processing of iron. These findings have implications for understanding bacterial iron acquisition and dissimilation, and organic/mineral interfaces. Key words: bacterial transferrin, dityrosyl motif, iron-binding protein, iron transport, oxo-iron cluster, X-ray crystallography.

INTRODUCTION

With few exceptions, bacteria require about 10 ­10 atoms of iron per generation to maintain a micromolar internal iron concentration, and iron increases the virulence of pathogenic strains ([1] and references cited therein). The earliest forms of life on earth experienced a reducing environment and utilized reduced (ferrous) iron, Fe2+ [2], but prokaryotes have adapted to ferric iron, Fe3+ , since intense UV radiation, anaerobic photosynthesis and oxygen generation have led to the oxidation of Fe2+ . The bioavailability of Fe3+ in aqueous environments is severely restricted by the insolubility of Fe(OH)3 , and micro-organisms have developed special mechanisms to capture Fe3+ [3]. The uptake of ferric iron by bacteria is regulated by Fur (ferric uptake regulation)-like proteins, which are responsive to both external and internal iron levels, and control the acquisition of iron from transferrins and haems, and from siderophores, which are produced to sequester iron and deliver it to specific membrane receptors [1,4­ 6,]. No specific system for the transport of polymeric (hydr)oxo iron species appears to have been identified, despite the prevalence of such forms of iron in the environment [7]. Fbp (ferric-ion binding protein), a single-chain 34 kDa protein, plays a key role in transporting Fe3+ from the outer membrane through the periplasm to the cytoplasmic membrane in Gramnegative bacteria, including many pathogens such as Neisseria and Haemophilus [8] (Figure 1). Fbp is produced by Neisseria gonorrhoeae in response to iron starvation [9], and is thought to reside as the apoprotein in the periplasm, where it can accept iron from outer-membrane receptors and transport it to cytoplasmic membrane receptors. The crucial role played by Fbp in iron uptake is illustrated by N. gonorrhoeae fbp mutants in which expression of Fbp is abolished: they are incapable of using non-haem iron (FeCl3 , iron citrate, transferrin and lactoferrin) for growth [10]. The X-ray crystal structure of recombinant holo-Fbp, as isolated, shows a single Fe3+ in a closed interdomain binding cleft with His9 , Glu57 , Tyr195 , Tyr196 , water and phosphate (the `syn-

5

ergistic' anion) as iron ligands [11]. Phosphate can be replaced by other synergistic anions [12,13], which modulate the redox potential of bound iron [14]. Fbp shows strong structural homology with a single lobe of the bilobal proteins serum transferrin, ovotransferrin and lactoferrin, despite the lack of sequence identity [11,15]. Recently, we have characterized by X-ray crystallography [16] adducts of N. gonorrhoeae Fbp with bound oxo-Hf 4+ clusters containing either three or five Hf 4+ ions capped or uncapped by phosphate, clusters which resemble fragments of hafnium oxide minerals. Intriguingly, they lie in an open Fbpbinding cleft and are anchored only by Tyr195 and Tyr196 as protein ligands. Since the nature of the iron­Fbp complexes formed in the periplasm is unknown, and Fbp may even be able to sample iron directly in the external environment through exposure at the outer membrane [17], we have now investigated the possible formation of polynuclear iron­Fbp adducts. In the present study we report a set of three 1.8­1.9 Å (1 Å  0.1 nm) resolution X-ray structures of apo, mono-iron and oxo-tri-iron cluster forms of Fbp, which not only provide the first example of an iron-cluster adduct of a transferrin, but also `snapshots' of the versatile dynamic role of a highly conserved dityrosyl motif.

PEG 1450, 0.4 M imidazole/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, was added to 70 µl of the well solution described above containing apoFbp crystals. This addition caused the crystals to change from colourless to brown after approx. 20 min, and soaking was continued for a further 16 h.
X-ray data collection and structure determination (Table 1)

Protein preparations

We prepared recombinant N. gonorrhoeae Fe­Pi ­Fbp and apoFbp as described previously [14]. To reload with iron, apo-Fbp (30­50 µM) in 10 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, was treated with a 10­50-fold molar excess of Na3 [Fe(NTA)2 ]. After incubation at 310 K for 3 h, low-molecular-mass substances were removed on a PD-10 column, followed by ultrafiltration (Centricon YM-30 membrane, 30 kDa-molecular-mass cut-off; Millipore).
Crystallization of proteins

Large crystals of apo-Fbp were obtained in approx. 2 weeks at 277 K using the hanging-drop method. The well solution contained 30 % (w/v) PEG 1450, 0.4 M imidazole/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and the drop contained 5 µl of well solution and 5 µl of 0.38 mM apo-Fbp in 0.1 M KCl. High quality apo-Fbp crystals for reactions with diferric citrate were obtained by freshly seeding saturated drops with crushed crystals of apo-Fbp. The drop contained 5 µl of well solution (30 % PEG 1450, pH 7.2) and 5 µl of apo-Fbp solution (0.4 mM in 0.1 M KCl). After 1 week at 277 K, the seeds were introduced into the drop with a glass fibre. Large crystals of Fe­NTA­Fbp were obtained in approx. 2 weeks at 277 K using the hanging-drop method from a sample of apo-Fbp which had been reloaded with iron using excess [Fe(NTA)2 ]3- . The well solution contained PEG 4000 22 %, 0.4 M imidazole/HCl buffer, pH 6.9, and the drop contained 5 µl of the well solution and 5 µl of 0.4 mM Fe­Fbp in 0.1 M KCl.

Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid N2 and X-ray data for Fe­Fbp were collected on station 14.1 (Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, Cheshire, U.K.;  = 1.488 Å) using an ADSC Quantum4 charge-coupled-device detector, and for apo-Fbp and Fe3 ­Fbp at 100 K using a rotating anode generator RF591 ( = 1.542 Å) where the anomalous contribution from Fe ¯ ¯ is approx. 3.1 e and P is approx. 0.4 e (comparable peaks visible for P and Met S of apo-Fbp), and processed and scaled using XDS (Fe3 ­Fbp) [20] and HKL2000 (apo-Fbp and Fe­Fbp) [21]. Crystals belonged to the space group P32 (all cell dimensions close to a = b = 145.7 Å and c = 114.2 Å). The structures were solved using the methods described previously in [16,22], with 9 molecules (from A to I) in the asymmetric part of the unit cell. The positions of the Fe atoms in Fe3 ­Fbp were revealed by difference anomalous Fourier synthesis calculated with the phases from the model refined without clusters. Peak heights were from 3­7.5  and clearly indicated the triatomic nature of the clusters, especially for molecules A, B, G and H. The clusters in the other molecules were disordered and the model for the density was based on that for A, B, G and H; all clusters were triatomic after further refinement. We were able to observe with confidence an anomalous signal from phosphate at the 3  level, together with the signal from Met308 , which confirms the presence of bound phosphate in apo-Fbp.
Phosphodiesterase activity

This was measured by using BNPP as a substrate and observing the increase in absorption at 400 nm due to formation of 4-nitrophenolate {[23]; 400 (corrected to pH 8) = 18 205 M-1 · cm-1 }, using 0.5 ml of solution in a 1-cm-pathlength quartz cuvette at 310 K on a Cary 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

Solvent-accessible surface models (grey; O atoms of Tyr195 and Tyr196 red) of (A) molecule F and (B) molecule A, with oxo-iron clusters as ball-and-stick representations (O, red; Fe, purple). Note the dark-red spot on the surface of molecule F in (A) indicating the hydroxy group of Tyr196 , which is flipped away from the cluster and exposed to the solvent (for details, see Figures 3C and 3D). In all the other eight molecules, Tyr196 is co-ordinated to iron as shown in (B). The cluster in molecule A sits deeper in the cleft.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Typically, reactions of apo-Fbp with excess [Fe(NTA)2 ] gave rise to proteins with Fe/protein molar ratios of 1.8­2.4:1 after removal of unbound complex and other low-molecular-mass substances. Cation-exchange chromatography of Fe2.4 ­Fbp gave rise to two resolved peaks (results not shown), each with associated absorption at 280 and 480 nm, showing that both protein fractions contained Fe3+ ­tyrosinate bonds. Crystallization of Fe2.4 ­Fbp gave two kinds of crystals in the same crystallization drop: the first turned out to be Fe­NTA­Fbp, and the structure was solved (see below), whereas the second, thought to be iron-cluster Fbp, contained a very large unit cell (100 Å × 384 Å × 209 Å) and the structure was not readily solved. Therefore, we attempted to prepare iron-cluster Fbp by an alternative route, by soaking crystals of the apoprotein in diferric dicitrate, a procedure used recently for introducing iron into apo-FecA crystals [24]. Diferric dicitrate itself is thought to be an important donor of iron to cells, binding to the specific receptor FecA, which induces transcription of the fecABCDE operon.

Colourless crystals of apo-Fbp soaked in a solution of diferric citrate [Fe2 (cit)2 (H2 O)2 ]2- turned brown, and we determined the structure of the brown crystals at 1.8 Å resolution. Though the electron density does not reach atomic resolution, the maps clearly indicated the presence of tri-iron clusters. The iron atoms were confidently revealed both by the |F obs - F calc |, PHIomit difference map and by the anomalous Fourier map, calculated with the phases PHIomit from the model, refined with the binding cleft empty. The orientation of the cluster in the metal-binding clefts of the nine molecules A-I in the asymmetric part of the unit cell vary, but the overall shapes of all clusters in the |F obs - F calc |, PHIomit difference map are very similar, and correspond well to Fe3 O13 tri-iron structural units. Such units are present in 19 entries in the Cambridge Crystallographic Database, and often form part of extended arrays in higher order iron aggregates. The oxygen atoms in Fe3 O13 units lie in approximately parallel layers with approximate closest-packing geometry. Examples include [Fe9 O(cit)8 (H2 O)3 ]7- [25] and Fe19 -oxyhydroxide clus-

ters encapsulated by N-(1-hydroxymethylethyl)iminodiacetate ligands [26]. All nine Fbp molecules in the asymmetric unit contain tri-iron clusters. Each cluster is situated in an open binding cleft (Figure 2), and contains a triangle of Fe3+ ions with each pair bridged by a µ2 -oxygen (Figures 3C and 3D). A central µ3 -oxygen co-ordinates to all three irons. Three additional terminal oxygen co-ordinate to each Fe3+ of the tightly bridged Fe3 O4 unit and complete the oxygen co-ordination shell of the octahedral iron atoms within the Fe3 O13 cluster. We manually manoeuvred the Fe3 O13 clusters (taken from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database) into the difference maps for all molecules A­I and adjusted them to match the electron density. In all of the 9 molecules in the asymmetric part of the unit cell, except F, the hydroxy group of Tyr196 is deprotonated and occupies the position of the central µ3 -oxygen in the co-ordination sphere of the tri-iron cluster (Figure 3D). Surprisingly, in molecule F this tyrosine (Tyr196 ) is turned away from the cluster and a µ3 oxide is recruited from water (Figure 3C). The co-ordination of the adjacent tyrosine (Tyr195 ) varies much more widely. In molecules A, B, F, G, H and I, Tyr195 is directly co-ordinated to iron and appears to be deprotonated. In other molecules, it is not. Tyr195 forms a hydrogen bond with one of the terminal oxygen atoms of the cluster in molecules D and E, and with one of the bridging µ2 -oxygen atoms in molecule C. Also residues Ser139 and Asn175 make H-bond contacts with the bound cluster (Figure 3). None of the oxo tri-iron clusters bound to Fbp appears to contain bound citrate. This can be rationalized on the basis of the known aqueous solution chemistry of diferric dicitrate. Crystalline diferric dicitrate consists of two Fe3+ ions bridged by two alkoxide oxygen atoms of fully deprotonated citrate ligands [19]. The complex is stable in acidic solution at pH 2­3, in equilibrium with higher-order clusters, such as [Fe9 O(cit)8 (H2 O)3 ]7- [25]. In 1:1 Fe3+ /citrate solutions, citrate is known to dissociate from Fe3+ at pH 4 and above to give (hydr)oxy-iron polymers (particles) with citrate ions bound to the surface, so preventing precipitation [27]. This chemical transformation is readily observable by UV-visible spectroscopy: the colour of the solution changes from yellow­ green at pH 2­3 to red­brown at pH 8. We find that the rate depends on the exact conditions (higher with hydroxide addition than in buffers, and on exposure to light; results not shown). Since ferric citrate is widely used in studies of iron uptake by cells under

a variety of conditions, further studies on its speciation in culture medium and in cells are warranted. In a recent 2.5 Å resolution X-ray study [24], crystals of the outer membrane iron receptor apo-FecA soaked in ferric citrate at pH 8 appeared to capture diferric dicitrate itself, triggering a conformational change of the extracellular loops of FecA and closing the external pocket. It would be interesting to investigate whether FecA can bind oxoiron clusters and whether these can trigger receptor gating. It is notable that FecA contains several Tyr­Tyr sequences.

Open-cleft mono-iron Fbp

X-ray crystallography showed that crystallization of the product from the reaction of apo-Fbp with [Fe(NTA)2 ]3- gives rise not only to crystals of the cluster adduct Fe3 ­Fbp, but also to crystals of the mono-iron adduct Fe­NTA­Fbp. This contains a single Fe3+ only bound to Tyr195 and Tyr196 as protein ligands, and also to tetradentate NTA in an open protein cleft (Figure 3E). Fe3+ is shielded from solvent by the chelated NTA ligand in much the same way as by bound EDTA in the recently reported structure of Haemophilus influenzae Fe­EDTA­Fbp [28], in which His9 (an Fe3+ ligand in closed-cleft holo-Fe­Pi ­Fbp) had been mutated to Gln. Our present work therefore shows that open-cleft mono-Fe­ Fbp is stable even for the native protein. An open-cleft form of hen Fe­(N-lobe)­ovotransferrin prepared by soaking crystals of the apo-protein with Fe­NTA has been reported [29], also with iron bound only to two Tyr ligands (Tyr92 and Tyr191 ) and tetradentate
c 2003 Biochemical Society

NTA. The authors concluded that the open-cleft conformation was trapped by crystal packing forces. Since our Fe­NTA­Fbp was crystallized from preformed complex, the cleft opening observed here does not appear to depend on such packing forces. In the X-ray structure of an adduct of an 18 kDa N-lobe domain-II fragment of duck ovotransferrin with bound iron and NTA [30], only one of the two tyrosine residues (Tyr194 ) which bind iron in the cleft of the native duck protein is bound to Fe3+ , whereas the other (Tyr95 ) is 3.8 Å away from iron. Such movements of the ironbinding tyrosine residues also observed in the work reported in the present study for intact bacterial transferrin (in Fe3 ­Fbp and apoFbp, see below, Figure 4) are probably crucial for iron processing by transferrins. Clearly residues His9 and Glu57 which bind to iron in holo-Fe­Pi ­Fbp are not required for Fe3+ binding in an open cleft. The opening of the binding cleft of Fe­Fbp is likely to have a major effect on the reactivity of the bound iron.

Tyrosine movement in apo-Fbp

The versatile dynamic roles of the side chains of Tyr195 and Tyr196 are further evident from our 1.9 Å resolution X-ray structure of apo-Fbp. All 9 molecules in the asymmetric part of the unit cell of our crystal form contain bound phosphate, despite the lack of phosphate addition during the purification procedure. The high quality of the X-ray data allowed confirmation of the presence of phosphate by a strong peak in the anomalous density map (Figures 3A and 3B), comparable in height with the peak for the

The conformational flexibility of Tyr196 may play a role in guiding iron into the cleft.) (B) Open-cleft Fe­Fbp with iron bound to Tyr195 and Tyr196 and a chelating ligand {e.g. NTA (Figure 3E) or EDTA [28]}. (C) Fe3 ­Fbp (Figures 3C and D) showing an open cleft with flexible roles for Tyr195 and Tyr196 . Enlargement of the cluster may be possible, as observed for hafnium [16]. (D) Closed cleft holo-Fbp with His9 and Glu57 in addition to Tyr195 and Tyr196 as protein ligands for Fe3+ , together with the synergistic anion phosphate and water [11].

S atom of the methionine residue. As for H. influenzae apoFbp [31], phosphate is specifically bound to the N-terminus of the helix which terminates in Ala141 and the phosphate oxygen atoms are within 3­ 4 Å of the oxygens of Tyr195 and Tyr196 (Figure 3B). Similar to the structure of Fe3 ­Fbp, Tyr196 in molecule F of apo-Fbp is also flipped towards the entrance of the binding cleft, suggesting a potential role for Tyr196 in guiding iron complexes into the cleft. Evidently the two iron-binding tyrosine residues can have distinctly different roles within the binding cleft of Fbp, as has been illustrated for human transferrin by mutation of Tyr95 and Tyr188 , the metal-binding tyrosine residues in the N-lobe cleft [32] and for the duck NII domain fragment [30].

activity could provide a mechanism for signalling iron status by coupling cluster breakdown and cleft closure around a single iron.

Implications for bacterial iron transport

Phosphatase activity

We investigated whether Fe3+ in open-cleft Fbp is accessible and potentially reactive. We studied reactions of Fe­Fbp with BNPP, a model substrate for phosphatase activity [33]. No reactions were observed between BNPP and [Fe(NTA)2 ]3- or apo-Fbp in Tris buffer, or with holo-Fe­Pi ­Fbp in Hepes buffer. However, holo-Fbp from which bound phosphate had been removed by ultrafiltration in 50 mM Tris buffer [16] did cleave the phosphoester bonds of BNPP slowly (increase in absorption at 400 nm), consistent with the opening of the binding cleft on phosphate removal. Reloaded Fe2.4 ­Fbp was also an active phosphatase. We determined a first-order rate constant of 5 × 10-6 s-1 for this sample (40 µM Fbp, 0.42 mM BNPP and 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 310 K). This represents an increase in rate of BNPP hydrolysis by approx. > 104 compared with the spontaneous rate (too low to measure under our conditions; previously reported as 3 × 10-10 s-1 at 323 K, pH 7 [34]). It will be interesting to investigate the activity of various forms of iron Fbp and also the recognition of a range of potential natural substrates. Phosphatase

Since Fe­Fbp has been characterized only as a mono-iron complex previously, it is has been assumed that iron is transported across the periplasm only as mononuclear centres. Our work shows that Fbp can readily bind oxo-iron cluster adducts, which therefore introduces the possibility that clusters, which are small fragments of (hydr)oxo iron minerals, could be involved in iron trafficking (Figure 4). Whether such clusters can be acquired directly from the external environment by periplasmic Fbp [35] (since it is known to have access to the outer surface of bacteria [17]), or can be assembled from uptake of mononuclear iron, remains to be investigated further. It is notable that in some bacteria FecA is a receptor for diferric dicitrate (the iron donor we used to form Fe3 ­Fbp) and a database search revealed that nearly half of the bacteria which possess a Fbp homologue also possess a FecA homologue (Figure 1). FecA might therefore be considered as a possible donor of polynuclear iron to Fbp. Fe3 ­Fbp appears to be the first example of an oxo tri-iron centre in a metalloprotein. (Hydr)oxo-di-iron centres are well known, being present in, for example, ribonucleotide reductase, methane mono-oxidase and haemerythyrin [36], whereas ferritin has a particulate core of (largely) Fe(O)OH, taken up as Fe2+ and oxidized in gated pores in the protein coat [37,38]. Sulphidebridged di-, tri- and tetra-iron clusters are found in ferredoxins. Ferredoxins have a multitude of diverse roles, including electron transport, and probably sustained early life in a highly reducing environment [39]. Oxo-iron clusters bound to Fbp may also have interesting redox activity. As well as playing a role in iron uptake in pathogens, Fbp could also be involved in iron acquisition by

iron dissimilatory bacteria, such as Shewanella oneidensis (Figure 1), which shuttles electrons from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane for the reductive breakdown of Fe3+ minerals [40]. Shewanella can adsorb and grow on fine-grained aggregates of ferrihydrite [41], but little is known about the proteins involved in the iron-uptake mechanism in this micro-organism. The mobility and acid­base properties of the side chains provide the dityrosyl motif of bacterial transferrin with a potentially versatile role in the capture and release of iron (Figure 4). Although in most of the nine protein molecules A­I in the unit cell of Fe3 ­Fbp the tri-iron cluster is anchored by Tyr196 as a triplebridging ligand and by Tyr195 as a monodentate terminal ligand, either tyrosine residue can also act as a single arm anchor for the cluster. Hence the verstatile structural roles of these Tyr residues may provide facile mechanisms for iron uptake and release either as mono- or poly-nuclear centres. It remains to be seen whether eukaryotic transferrins can also bind to iron clusters. In sTf (serum transferrin), the tyrosine residues which bind to iron in closed-cleft Fe­CO3 ­sTf are well separated in the sequence [15] (95 and 188 in the N-lobe, 426 and 517 C-lobe) and not sequential as in Fbp. Either of these tyrosine residues could perhaps act as an anchor for an oxo-iron cluster under certain conditions. Notable, however, is the presence of a highly conserved dityrosyl motif in the N-lobe (Tyr95 ­Tyr96 ) of sTf. Perhaps this motif could also be functional in cluster recognition by sTF. Studies of a wide range of bacteria should now enable exploration of the potential role of iron-cluster Fbp in perplasmic iron trafficking, so providing new insights into bacterial­mineral interfaces, virulence and the design of novel antibiotics. Intriguingly, we find that the oxophilic ion Zr4+ , a potential metallo-antibiotic, can block Fe3+ binding by Fbp and that even 1:1 mixtures of apo-Fbp and Zr4+ lead to the assembly of trizirconium clusters in the binding cleft [42].
