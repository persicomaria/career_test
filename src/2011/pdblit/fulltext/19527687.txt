We solved the X-ray structures of two Escherichia coli tRNASer acceptor stem microhelices. As both tRNAs are aminoacylated by the same seryl-tRNA-synthetase, we performed a comparative structure analysis of both duplexes to investigate the helical conformation, the hydration patterns and magnesium binding sites. It is well accepted, that the hydration of RNA plays an important role in RNA­protein interactions and that the extensive solvent content of the minor groove has a special function in RNA. The detailed comparison of both tRNASer microhelices provides insights into the structural arrangement of the isoacceptor tRNA aminoacyl stems with respect to the surrounding water molecules and may eventually help us to understand their biological function at atomic resolution.

1. Introduction

The correct translation of the genetic code is assured by aminoacyl-tRNAs, which are the adapters between mRNA codons and the amino acids of proteins. Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, there often exist multiple codons for the same amino acid, which in turn implicates the existence of multiple tRNA isoacceptors. For example, there are six codons for the amino acid arginine and therefore at least six tRNAArg isoacceptors. The amino acid specificity of a tRNA is assured by identity elements, which are sequence or structure motifs spread over different regions in the respective tRNAs. tRNAs are aminoacylated by the specific aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases. These enzymes can be divided into two classes, class I and class II [1]. Within the first class, tRNA identity elements are complex and contain sequence/structure motifs that are located in different regions of the tRNAs, mostly including the anticodon. In the second class, the identity elements are simple and mostly located in the region of the aminoacyl stem, sometimes including the discriminator base at position 73 [1]. The tRNA determinants in class II can be so simple as to consist of only one single base pair, as has been reported for the alanine specific tRNA [2].

The tRNASer/seryl-tRNA-synthetase (SerRS) system belongs to the class II system and has been extensively investigated. tRNASer identity elements which assure the specificity for serine consist of the base pairs A3­U70, G2­C71, the nucleotide C72, the discriminator base G73 and additionally C11­G24 in the D-stem [3­6]. Further, footprinting experiments could describe the following interactions between tRNASer and seryl-tRNA-synthetase: the tRNASer contacts the enzyme with the nucleotides C67, U68, C69 and U70 which are located in the aminoacyl stem. Additional contacts are located in the T-region and the long extra arm of tRNASer [7]. The crystal structures of the complex between tRNASer and the Thermus thermophilus SerRS revealed atomic details of the threedimensional contact site between the RNA and the enzyme [8,9]. Contacts include the 50 - and 30 -ends of the tRNASer aminoacyl stem, the GCCA-end and the long, unique extra arm. Nucleotides in the aminoacyl region that are involved in the interaction, like G2­ C71, C69, U68, contact amino acids from the loop 2 region of the seryl-tRNA-synthetase. The interactions are mainly described to consist of phosphate backbone contacts rather than involving the nucleic acid bases, which is in agreement with the results obtained by footprinting experiments [7]. We focused our interest in solving high resolution crystal structures of tRNA acceptor stem microhelices of the `class II' system to contribute to the structure/function relationship of tRNA isoacceptors with different sequence, but possessing the same amino acid specificity. Additionally, it is now well accepted

that the extensive hydration of the RNA minor groove, which is governed by the presence of the ribose 20 -hydroxyl group, has a special function in RNA­protein interaction [10,11]. We have shown that the detailed hydration pattern of tRNA microhelices can be determined by high resolution X-ray crystallography which ambitioned us to start detailed comparative structure analyses of isoacceptor tRNA acceptor stem microhelices. One of the systems that we investigated is the `class II' tRNASer system. Since we have recently solved two crystal structures from Escherichia coli tRNASer aminoacyl stems [12,13], we are now able to perform superposition experiments between the two RNAs. Here we present the comparative crystal structure analysis of the tRNASer isoacceptor RS 1660 and RS 1661 [14] microhelices with special focus on the specific hydration patterns and magnesium binding sites.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Preparation of the E. coli tRNASer acceptor stem microhelices The sequences of both tRNASer microhelices, originating from E. coli, were derived from the tRNA compilation data base [14]. The tRNASer acceptor stem isoacceptor RS 1660 has the sequence 50 -G1G2A3G4A5G6A7-30 and 50 -U66C67U68C69U70C71C72-30 whereas the isoacceptor RS 1661 was adapted from the sequence 50 G1G2U3G4A5G6G7-30 and 50 -C66C67U68C69A70C71C72-30 . These 7mer microhelices possess a naturally occurring change of 2 bp with simultaneously maintaining the specificity for the amino acid serine. All RNA strands were purchased from IBA (Göttingen, Germany) with HPLC-purification grade. The complementary strands of the tRNASer microhelices were hybridized in water at a concen-

tration of 0.5 mM. Correct annealing was assured by heating to a temperature of 90 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature over a time period of 120 min. The resulting tRNASer helices were used for all following experiments. 2.2. Crystallization, acquisition of X-ray diffraction data, structure calculation and superposition of the tRNASer acceptor stem microhelices Crystallization of the E. coli tRNASer microhelix RS 1660 succeeded by using 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 15 mM magnesium sulfate and 1.8 M lithium sulfate at 20 °C and an RNA concentration of 0.5 mM. The set ups were performed in 24-well Linbro Plates (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Ohio, USA), using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing 1 ll of the aqueous RNA with 1 ll of the crystallization solution and equilibration against 1 ml crystallization liquor. Crystals appeared after approximately 3 weeks and were flash frozen with liquid nitrogen in a cryo-protecting solution containing additionally 20% (v/v) glycerol prior to X-ray diffraction data collection [12]. The E. coli tRNASer microhelix RS 1661 crystallized under the following condition: 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentandiole (MPD), 40 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 5.5, 20 mM cobalt hexamine, 80 mM sodium chloride and 20 mM magnesium chloride and equilibration against 1 ml of 35% (v/v) MPD at 294 K. In this case the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique was applied using Linbro Plates (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Ohio, USA). One microliter of the 0.5 mM aqueous RNA solution was mixed with 1 ll of the crystallization solution and good looking crystals appeared after a few days [13]. No further cryo-protectant had to be added due to the presence of 10% (v/v) MPD. The X-ray diffraction data were collected at the ELETTRA synchrotron in Trieste, Italy, X-ray diffraction beam line XRD1 (5.2R) at a wavelength of 0.9 Å (tRNASer isoacceptor helix RS 1660) and 1.0 Å (tRNASer isoacceptor helix RS 1660), respectively [12,13]. Data processing, space group and unit cell parameters were calculated with the HKL2000 package [15]. Both E. coli tRNASer acceptor stem microhelix structures were solved by molecular replacement techniques using the programs as described in the structure papers [12,13], wherein the structure of the E. coli tRNASer microhelix RS 1660 was reported at 1.8 Å resolution [12] and the E. coli tRNASer microhelix RS 1661 showed a resolution of 1.2 Å [13]. The superposition experiments of these two helices and the following structure graphics were done with the program PYMOL [16].

(Fig. 1A) [14]. This helix also crystallizes in the space group C2 with following cell constants: a = 35.79, b = 39.13, c = 31.37 Å and b = 111.1° [13]. The structure was solved to 1.2 Å resolution and the crystallographic data were refined within the region of 80­ 1.20 Å to R-values of R/Rfree = 19.0/20.1%. The crystals contained one RNA molecule per asymmetric unit with additionally 97 water molecules and two magnesium ions. The coordinates were assigned the PDB-ID 2GVN at the RCSB data base. A representative electron density map of a base pair of this structure is presented in Fig. 1B.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Comparison of the two tRNASer acceptor stem microhelix structures Both sequences of the E. coli tRNASer acceptor stems are outlined in Fig. 1A. The tRNASer microhelix RS 1660 crystallizes in the space group C2 with the cell constants a = 36.10, b = 38.92, c = 30.79 Å and b = 110.61° and one molecule per asymmetric unit [12]. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to a final R-factor of 15.4% using diffraction data in the range of 17.5 and 1.8 Å resolution, with a corresponding Rfree of 19.5%. We could detect a total of 75 well-defined water oxygen atoms of the water molecules surrounding the RNA. No further ligands or metal ions could be detected for this microhelix. The coordinates of the microhelix RS 1660 have been deposited at the RCSB data base with the PDB-ID: 2V6W. The second tRNASer microhelix, derived from the E. coli RS 1661 tRNASer isoacceptor differs from the first microhelix by a natural occurring exchange of the base pairs at position 3­70 and 7­66

The superposition of both tRNASer microhelices shows a similar helical arrangement (Fig. 2). The sequences of the RNA 7mer helices differ within 2 bp: the A3­U70 in tRNASer (RS 1660) is exchanged by U3­A70 in tRNASer (RS 1661) and at position 7­66, the A­U is replaced by G­C in tRNASer (RS 1661). Therefore, a slight deviation can be noticed in the overall helical arrangement of the two helices. Nevertheless, the superposition outlines comparative RNA duplex structures with large similarity. Interestingly, both RNAs crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2 with one molecule per asymmetric unit, but the crystallization conditions of the helices that lead to successful structure determination differ substantial [12,13]. The tRNASer microhelix (RS 1660) crystallized with lithium sulfate as a precipitant, whereas the tRNASer microhelix (RS 1661) crystals were obtained under MPD conditions. 3.2. Hydration patterns in the tRNASer acceptor stem microhelices As it is well accepted that the extensive hydration of the minor grove of RNA plays an important role in RNA­protein interaction, we focused our interest in analyzing the hydration patterns of both tRNASer acceptor stem microhelices. Particularly the acceptor stem of `class II' tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase systems is of substantial interest, as this is the part of the tRNA, which carries the identity elements for their amino acid specificity. In Fig. 3A we present the superposition of the helices by showing the base pairs G2­C71, which is an identity base pair in tRNASer and C69­G4, as C69 has been described to play a role in synthetase recognition [3­7]. As the structures were solved to 1.8 Å (RS 1660) and 1.2 Å (RS 1661) resolution we could detect a variety of water

oxygen atoms surrounding the RNAs. In the tRNASer RS 1660 we could observe 75 water molecules per helix and in the second tRNASer, RS 1661, we could detect 97 water molecules. Regarding the distribution of the water molecules in the G2­C71 identity base pair (Fig. 3A) a nearly identical distribution can be observed, which leads to a very similar hydration pattern in both tRNAs at this position. Also for the C69 nucleotide (Fig. 3B), the superposition of both microhelices showed a picture of a nearby identical position of the nucleotide and of the surrounding water molecules. Regarding the overall distribution of water molecules in the two helices, the hydration patterns show different arrangements, which generally do not seem to share similar positions of solvent molecules (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the base pairs and nucleotides which are involved in tRNASer identity show a common position and conserved conformation within the superposition. As the surrounding water molecules follow the general rules of hydrogen bond-donor and acceptors, the sequence of the RNAs and the conformation of the nucleotides determine the hydration pattern. The similarity of the hydration picture in vicinity of nucleotides, which determine tRNA specificity surely plays a functional role in tRNA-synthetase recognition, as the surrounding water molecules present the first contact site to the synthetase.

3.3. Magnesium binding sites in tRNASer It is often questioned, whether there are specific magnesium sites in tRNAs. A magnesium binding site has been repeatedly reported to occur within the first nucleotides of the acceptor stem, in vicinity of the base pair 3­70 [17­19]. In the tRNASer

microhelices, we could detect two magnesium binding sites in the RS 1661 isoacceptor. Both magnesium ions are located within the region of the nucleotide G6 (Fig. 3C and D). Magnesium 1 is coordinated to the exo- and endocyclic nitrogen atoms of G6 and is positioned in the major groove of the RNA (Fig. 3C). Magnesium 2 is attached to the same nucleotide G6, but lies at the opposite position in the minor groove of the RNA (Fig. 3D). Both magnesium ions are coordinated to surrounding water molecules. The superposition of both tRNASer microhelices shows a variety of water molecules within the region of nucleotide G6, but with non-identical locations. Nevertheless, as we could not detect any ligand within this region in the tRNASer RS 1660 isoacceptor, the regions which are occupied by magnesium ions in the isoacceptor RS1661 are not occupied by water in the other tRNA microhelix. This leaves the question open whether there may exist a magnesium binding site in the second tRNASer microhelix, but we were unable to detect it in the electron density map. Conclusively, the superposition of two E. coli tRNASer microhelix crystal structures revealed similar helical conformations within both RNA duplexes. The overall hydration pattern in both structures shows a different spatial distribution, but regarding the conserved tRNASer identity elements, a nearby identical picture of the surrounding water molecules can be observed within these conserved nucleotides. The magnesium binding sites in the tRNASer isoacceptor RS 1661 could not be detected in tRNASer RS 1660, but the specific positions are not occupied by water molecules. The possible specificity of these two magnesium binding sites in tRNASer isoacceptor helices still has to be questioned. With the here presented superposition experiments and interpretation, we contribute new and further insights to tRNA conformation and hydration in general and to the tRNASer system in special. Further structure investigations with tRNA microhelices will help to understand tRNA structure/function relationships and tRNA hydration patterns.
