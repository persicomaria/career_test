Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is the infectious agent responsible for Kaposi's sarcoma and encodes a protein, macrophage inflammatory protein-II (vMIP-II), which shows sequence similarity to the human CC chemokines. vMIP-II has broad receptor specificity that crosses chemokine receptor subfamilies, and inhibits HIV-1 viral entry mediated by numerous chemokine receptors. In this study, the solution structure of chemically synthesized vMIP-II was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. The protein is a monomer and possesses the chemokine fold consisting of a flexible N-terminus, three antiparallel b strands, and a C-terminal a helix. Except for the N-terminal residues (residues 1±13) and the last two C-terminal residues (residues 73±74), the structure of vMIP-II is well-defined,   exhibiting average rmsd of 0.35 and 0.90 A for the

backbone heavy atoms and all heavy atoms of residues 14±72, respectively. Taking into account the sequence differences between the various CC chemokines and comparing their three-dimensional structures allows us to implicate residues that influence the quaternary structure and receptor binding and activation of these proteins in solution. The analysis of the sequence and three-dimensional structure of vMIP-II indicates the presence of epitopes involved in binding two receptors CCR2 and CCR5. We propose that vMIP-II was initially specific for CCR5 and acquired receptor-binding properties to CCR2 and other chemokine receptors. Keywords: HHV-8; Kaposi's sarcoma; chemokine; NMR structure; chemokine receptor binding.

Chemokines belong to the largest family of cytokines and function by activating G protein-coupled receptors to induce the proliferation, differentiation, or chemotaxis of target cells [1]. These proteins are members of one of several subfamilies. The two largest subfamilies are defined by the presence (CXC chemokines) or absence (CC chemokines) of an intervening amino acid between the first two of four invariant cysteines. Two chemokines that do not belong to either of these subfamilies, and thus may define two minor subfamilies, are lymphotactin [2] and fractalkine [3]. Lymphotactin possesses only two of the invariant cysteines (C chemokine), and fractalkine has three residues that separate the first two cysteines (CX3C chemokine). Human chemokines show strict specificity for binding and activating receptors within their own subfamily. For example, only CXC chemokines, but not chemokines

from other subfamilies, can compete for binding to the CXC chemokine receptors. Similarly, CC chemokines, but not CXC, CX3C, nor C chemokines, can compete for binding to CC chemokine receptors [1]. The structural source of this specificity is not known. While there is no known competition for binding to receptors across subfamilies among human chemokines, the herpesvirus-8 chemokine macrophage inflammatory proteinII (vMIP-II) is a receptor antagonist for CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, CXCR4, and CX3C receptors [4±6]. In addition, vMIP-II is an agonist for CCR3 [5]. The effect of the binding of vMIP-II to CCR8 is controversial as both agonism [6a] and antagonism [6b] have been reported. vMIP-II induces eosinophil and Th2 chemotaxis, and is angiogenic, suggesting that it may play a pathogenic role in the highly angiogenic multicentric tumors of Kaposi's sarcoma [4,5]. The binding of a single chemokine to numerous receptors raises questions as to how a single protein surface can possess receptor-binding epitopes for so many receptors. Moreover, the expression of a chemokine from a human herpesvirus genome suggests that the gene was pirated from the human genome. Knowledge of its evolutionary history may provide clues to its ability to bind receptors of different chemokine subfamilies. The binding of vMIP-II to the two major HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 results in inhibition of in vitro infection mediated by these two chemokine receptors. A previous study explored the structural determinants that may give rise to receptor antagonism to these two receptors and to CCR3 [7]. The ability of vMIP-II to inhibit viral entry by multiple HIV-1 strains makes it an attractive protein to serve as a lead for developing broadspectrum anti-HIV agents. The broad-spectrum antagonism

to other chemokine receptors has been shown to be involved in the attenuation of inflammation in an animal model of glomerulonephritis [6] and suggests that vMIP-II also may be a useful template for development of antiinflammatory molecules. The original three-dimensional structures of a CXC [8] and CC [9] chemokine revealed dimeric structures. The structure of the individual monomers was the same between the two subfamilies (a three-stranded antiparallel b sheet packing against a C-terminal a helix), but the quaternary structure of each dimer was very different. The different quaternary structures provided an attractive hypothesis for the source of receptor selectivity among the two subfamilies. This hypothesis was undermined by the observation that (a) some biologically active mutant chemokines [10±12], and (b) some wild-type chemokines [10,13,14] exist exclusively as monomers in solution. Furthermore, additional oligomeric forms (tetramers and higher order oligomers) have also been observed [15,16]. In this report, we present the solution structure of vMIP-II produced by total chemical synthesis and compare its structure and sequence with those of other CC chemokines to explore more adequately the potential biological importance of oligomerization. In addition, multiple sequence alignment and structural analysis of chemokines that activate CCR2 and CCR5 identified potential receptor binding and selectivity residues.

Sample preparation The selenomethionine-modified vMIP-II (replacing Met66) was synthesized in two peptide segments by solid-phase methods. The two peptides were ligated, purified, and refolded to produce the full-length peptide as described previously [17]. The resulting protein was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Mass spectroscopy confirmed the refolded nature of the protein due to the loss of four protons when two disulfide bonds are made relative to the unfolded state. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein to a final concentration of 2 mm in 90% H2O/10% D2O or D2O containing 50 mm sodium phosphate and 0.1 mm NaN3. NMR data for the structure determination were collected at pH 3.25. For all other data, the pH was adjusted by adding microliter increments of DCl or NaOD. NMR studies NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian UNITY Plus 600-MHz spectrometer at a temperature of 308 K. Some experiments were also conducted at 303 K and 313 K to resolve ambiguities. Chemical shift assignments were based on clean TOCSY, DQF-COSY, NOESY, ROESY, and 5N-1H HSQC experiments as described previously [17]. TOCSY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 14, 30, 65, 80 and 100 ms and NOESY spectra with mixing times of 50, 100, 150 and 200 ms. ROESY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 35 ms in both H2O and D2O samples. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from a series of short TOCSY spectra collected immediately after dissolving the lyophilized

sample in D2O. All spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode using the States±TPPI method, and analyzed using felix 95 (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Assigned NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs, correspond    ing to upper distance restraints of 2.7 A (2.9 A for NOEs     involving NH protons), 3.3 A (3.5 A for NOEs involving     NH protons), 5.0 A, and 6.0 A, respectively, on the basis of 50 and 150 ms NOESY spectra [9,18]. In the case of distance restraints involving methyl protons, an additional   0.5 A was added to the upper distance limit to account for averaging due to the rapid rotation of the methyl group [19,20]. Where appropriate, averaging or ,r26. summation was applied to NOEs involving nonstereospecifically assigned protons [21±23]. Dihedral angle restraints for f backbone angles were based on 3JHN±Ha scalar coupling constants measured from the high-resolution DQF-COSY spectrum. Backbone f angles were only used in structural calculations for residues within clearly defined secondary structure. The restraints corresponded to 2608 ^ 308 or 21008 ^ 308 for a helix or b sheet, respectively. For residues with unmeasurable 3JHN±Ha scalar coupling constants, the f torsion angle was restrained to 21008 ^ 808 if the amide proton gave a more intense NOE to the Ca proton of the preceding residue compared to the NOE to its own Ca proton [24]. Side chain x1 angles were based on the Ha±Hb1 /Ha±Hb2 cross peak intensity ratios from short mixing time (14 ms) TOCSY experiments and the relative intensities of the NOEs from the NH and the Ca proton to Cb protons in 50 ms NOESY spectra in H2O and D2O [25]. x2 torsion angles for leucine residues were obtained from analysis of intraresidue NOEs between the Ca proton and Cd1 and Cd2 protons after establishing the correct x1 angle [26]. The oligomeric state of vMIP-II (i.e. monomer vs. dimer) was investigated by employing pulsed field gradient NMR self-diffusion measurements [27]. The value of the coefficient of self-diffusion, Ds, was obtained by fitting the signal attenuation as a function of gradient strength as determined by Eqn (1): A  A0 ¬ exp 2 g ¬ d ¬ G ¬ 2 ¬ D 2 d/3 ¬ Ds 1 where g  1H gyromagnetic ratio, d  PFG duration(s), G  gradient strength (G¥cm21), and D  time between PFG pulse(s). Gradients were calibrated using a spin-echo experiment. Structure calculations and analysis A total of 1290 NOE distance restraints including 38 hydrogen-bond restraints, 94 dihedral angle restraints, and   two disulfide bond restraints (dSgI 2 dSg2  2.1 A) were used in the structure calculation (Table 1). For each hydrogen   bond, two distance restraints were used (dNH±O  1.8±2.4 A,   ). Structures of vMIP-II were calculated dN±O  1.8±3.5 A from an extended strand starting conformation with the program xplor v. 3.851 [28] using a torsion-angle molecular dynamics protocol [29]. Four stages were used in each calculation. Initially, the regularized extended strands were subjected to 30 ps of torsion-angle molecular dynamics at 50 000 K with a scaling factor of 0.1 for the van der Waals energy, wvdW, to facilitate rotational barrier crossing.

Slow-cool torsion-angle molecular dynamics reduced the temperature from 50 000 to 1000 K over 30 ps while wvdW was linearly increased to 1.0. The NOE and dihedral   force constants were held at 150 kcal¥mol21¥A22 and 100 kcal¥mol21¥rad22, respectively. In the third stage, a slow-cool Cartesian molecular dynamics calculation from 1000 to 300 K in 6 ps was performed. Finally, the structures were subjected to 1000 steps of conjugate-gradient minimization. Analysis of the backbone torsion angles and quality of the structures was made using procheck [30]. The programs promotif [31] and molmol [32] were used for structural analyzes, comparisons, and visualization. Structural comparisons were also performed in insight II (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Electrostatic potentials were calculated with delphi as implemented in insight II.

vMIP-II is monomeric in solution Most chemokines tend to self-associate. This self-association is a dynamic, reversible process, which depends heavily on solution conditions. Many chemokines form homodimers or higher molecular mass aggregates. We had previously determined that vMIP-II is a monomer at pH 3.25 [17]. To determine whether the quaternary structure of vMIP-II is different at a more physiological pH, a series of one-dimensional 1H NMR experiments was acquired at 308 K (Fig. 1A). As the pH was increased from 3.25 to 7.00, the appearance of the 1D spectra and the peak

line width did not substantially change. All spectra contain a wide range of amide proton frequencies and many upfield-shifted methyl groups. This behavior indicates that vMIP-II is folded and does not self-associate in the pH range 3.25±7.00 in solution. The NMR spectrum at physiological pH suggests the structure is essentially unaltered from the low pH structure. The quaternary structure of vMIP-II was confirmed by employing pulsed field gradient NMR self-diffusion measurements. The fit of the data to Eqn (1) is shown in Fig. 1B. By using this method, the selfdiffusion coefficients of 1.50 ^ 0.06 ¬ 1026 cm2¥s21 and 1.52 ^ 0.04 ¬ 1026 cm2¥s21 for vMIP-II at pH 3.25 and pH 7.00 were measured, which are in good agreement with the corresponding value of 1.49 ¬ 1026 cm2¥s21 found for ubiquitin, a known monomeric protein with the size of 8.7 kDa (76 amino-acid residues). We therefore conclude that vMIP-II (a 74 amino-acid protein) is a monomer in solution at NMR concentrations from pH 3.25±7.0. Further experimental evidence that vMIP-II is a monomer in solution include detailed analysis of NOESY spectra that did not reveal NOE contacts at the N-terminus nor the residues at the first b strand analogous to those found between CC or CXC chemokine monomers. Attempts to induce dimerization by changing various solution conditions were unsuccessful [33], however, vMIP-II crystallizes as a CC dimer [34]. Since the NMR spectra at pH 3.25 provided the greatest dispersion, and other CC chemokine tertiary structures were determined at this pH [9,25], we chose to determine the solution structure of vMIP-II at this pH.

Three-dimensional structure of vMIP-II Resonance assignments for chemically synthesized vMIP-II were achieved using standard sequential assignment techniques based on DQF-COSY, clean TOCSY, NOESY, and 15N± 1H HSQC spectra. A wide dispersion of amide and Ca proton resonances from 5.38 to 9.70 ppm and from 2.92 to 5.89 ppm allowed complete resonance assignment of all of the backbone and almost all of the side-chain protons. The solution structure of vMIP-II was determined using NMR-derived restraints and the torsion-angle molecular dynamics protocol in xplor 3.851 [29]. The calculation of the final structures was based on 1290 NOE distance restraints and 94 dihedral angle restraints (Table 1). Of the 70 structures resulting from the final round of structure calculations, the 25 structures that exhibited the lowest   energy and no NOE violations greater than 0.5 A and no torsion angle violations greater than 58 were selected for further characterization. The structure of vMIP-II is well   defined with root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) of 0.35 A   for all for the backbone over residues 14±72 and 0.90 A heavy atoms (Table 1, Fig. 2A). Superposition of only well   ordered side-chain atoms of 21 residues (rmsd 0.64 A) is shown in Fig. 2B and indicates the high level precision with which the side chains are defined within the hydrophobic core. A ribbon representation of vMIP-II is shown in Fig. 2C. Higher backbone rmsds are present for the N- and C-terminal residues and loops defined by residues 14±17 and 35±41, which are characterized by relatively few NOE restraints. No long-range or medium-range NOEs were observed for the N-terminal residues 1±13 or the last two C-terminal residues. Structural statistics for the ensemble are given in Table 1. A stereochemical analysis of the ensemble using procheck showed that, for residues 14±72, 72% of the residues were in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, 25% were in the allowed regions, 3% were in the generously allowed regions, and no residues were in the disallowed regions. The precision of the torsion angles was assessed using procheck by the circular variance [30]. The circular variance varies from 0 to 1, with a lower value indicating a tighter clustering of the values about a single mean value. The circular variances of f and c torsion angles for the majority of the residues in the structured region (residues 14±72) are low. This indicates that the backbone of the structures is well defined with the exception of several residues in the 20s loop (also called N-loop, residues 14± 24) and 30s loop (residue 35±41). This implies that these regions of the protein are either relatively more mobile or less defined due to a lack of NOE information as indicated by the high rmsd of the backbone and side-chain atoms. Most side chains, especially the residues in the nonloop regions of the protein, are well defined as indicated by the x circular variance, which is close to 0. Higher values of circular variance and rmsd for side chains are observed for residues in the loop regions and charged residues. These charged residues tend to be located on the surface of the protein as indicated by the calculated surface accessibility. The chemically synthesized vMIP-II monomer has a typical chemokine-like fold consisting of three antiparallel b strands and an overlaying a helix and is essentially identical to the recombinant form (Fig. 2C) [7,34]. Regions of secondary structure were identified following the

Kabsch±Sander definitions. The N-terminus (residues 1±13) is disordered up to the first cysteine (Cys14). Following the second cysteine (Cys15) is a long irregular loop which ends in a type I turn (residues 25±28). This structural element is directly followed by the first b strand (residues 30±33). Residues Thr34 to Gly42 which include a type-IV b turn over residues 35±38 (30s loop) connect the first and second b strands. This region is characterized by relatively few NOE restraints. The second b strand extends from residue Val43 to Leu46 leading into a 3 : 5 hairpin that includes a type IV b turn (40s loop, residues 47±50). The third b strand runs from Gln52 to Ala55. A type I turn (50s loop, residues 56±59) links the third b strand to the C-terminal a helix (residues 60±68) that packs against the triple-stranded antiparallel b sheet. Residues 69±72 do not have any regular secondary structure, and the last two C-terminal residues (73±74) are completely unstructured. The tertiary structure of the protein is mainly stabilized by the two disulfide bonds and the hydrophobic core that is formed by residues from the b sheets and the C-terminal a helix (Fig. 2B). Structural source of monomer/dimer structures for CC chemokines The oligomeric state of chemokines involved in receptor binding and activation remains unresolved [11,12,35±37]. There is substantial evidence suggesting that monomers are active [11,12]. There are also data implicating chemokine dimers in receptor binding and activation [35±37]. Experiments that directly probe the oligomeric state of chemokines as they activate the receptor are difficult to perform and have not been reported. The difference in quaternary structures between CXC and CC chemokines can provide a simple explanation for the inability of chemokines from different subfamilies to compete for binding to a single receptor. It has been suggested that the monomeric solution structure of vMIP-II may allow it to adopt either a CC or CXC dimeric conformation on the cell surface and account for its ability to interact with receptors for chemokines from different subfamilies [33]. The crystal structure of vMIP-II is an elongated dimer typical of other CC chemokines [34]. The interactions that stabilize this dimer are predominantly from residues 7 and 19 of each subunit that fit into complementary grooves. In the NMR structure residues 1±13 are highly disordered; the subsequent residues (14±19) adopt a different conformation as compared to the crystal structure of vMIP-II. Leu46 is closely packed in the crystal structure and contributes to the groove into which binds the second subunit; in the NMR structure this residue protrudes into the surrounding solvent. Other specific factors that promote formation of complementary monomer±monomer interactions in the crystal structure are yet to be determined. We analyzed the structural features of vMIP-II that lead to its monomeric solution state as compared to other CC chemokines. It is evident from the reported structures of CC chemokines [9,10,13,25,38±40] that the majority form dimers. MIP-1a forms a higher molecular weight aggregate, but a mutation stabilizes the dimeric form, which allowed its solution structure to be determined [38]. MIP1a, MIP-1b [9], RANTES [25,39], and MCP-1 [40] form an `end on end' dimer. VMIP-II and HCC-2 [13] are the only CC chemokines that appear to form monomers under

solution conditions. The solution structure of eotaxin-1 was determined to be a monomer, but eotaxin-1 also exists in a monomer±dimer equilibrium [10]. Examination of the structures and sequences of vMIP-II and other chemokines (Fig. 3) suggest a number of differences that may explain why some chemokines form dimers rather than monomers in solution. These differences include (a) the flexibility of the N-terminal sequence, (b) the nature of the first residue that follows the CC sequence, and (c) the nature and conformation of the corresponding subunit binding site. In all monomeric chemokines, the N-terminal region preceding the CC sequence is flexible and disordered. In structurally characterized CC dimers, the N-terminal region from the one subunit forms complementary interactions with the corresponding region of the other subunit as well as with other regions of the second subunit. Experimental evidence in which deletion of N-terminal sequences preceding the first two cysteines converts the dimeric chemokine MCP-1 [12] into a monomer supports this structural observation and confirms the importance of the N-terminal sequence in dimerization. The residue that immediately follows the CC sequence may also be important in stabilizing subunit association. In structurally characterized dimeric CC chemokines as well as in eotaxin-1, an aromatic residue (phenylalanine in MIP1a, MIP-1b, RANTES, and eotaxin-1, tyrosine in MCP-1) follows the CC sequence and is part of a strongly hydrophobic stretch of the N-terminal loop that is involved in dimerization [9,25,39,40]. This residue is a leucine (Leu16) and threonine (Thr8) in vMIP-II and HCC-2, respectively. The aromatic group for the dimeric chemokines points in a direction that allows it to fit into a hydrophobic pocket of the second subunit. For example, in the solution structure of RANTES this hydrophobic interaction involves the packing of the aromatic ring of Phe12 from one subunit against the aliphatic side chain of Lys33 from the second subunit, an interaction that influences the orientation of the loop connecting strands b2 and b3 of one monomer with respect to the N-terminal residues of the other monomer [25]. Similarly, the corresponding side chain of MCP-1 (Tyr13), points in a direction where it fits into a hydrophobic pocket. In eotaxin-1, the side chain of Phe11 points in a direction that is rotated by approximately 608 compared to the other dimeric residues. The inability of Phe11 (eotaxin-1), Leu16 (for vMIP-II), or Thr8 (for HCC-2) to make appropriate hydrophobic interactions with a second subunit may contribute to the monomeric structures of these respective chemokines in solution. To identify areas other than the N-terminal region involved in formation of the dimeric interface, we analyzed the subunit interactions of the dimeric proteins RANTES, MCP-1, and MIP-1b and compared them to the monomeric chemokines vMIP-II and HCC-2. There were many similarities among the dimeric proteins. We compared the orientation of residues/regions involved in intersubunit interactions with the corresponding areas in vMIP-II and HCC-2. One possible explanation for the difference in quaternary structure of monomeric and dimeric chemokines appears to be in differences in the distance between corresponding Ca atoms and the orientation of side chains. For simplicity, the focus of our comparisons will only be on RANTES as representative of the dimeric molecule. The loop connecting the first and second b strands (30s loop)

is an important part of the subunit binding site. Although the two b strands superimpose well with the monomeric HCC-2, the 30s loop of these two chemokines is very different, with distances between corresponding Ca atoms   of up to 3.5 A. This results in side-chain orientations in HCC-2 that are very different from those of RANTES. A similar observation is seen when comparing vMIP-II and the solution structure of RANTES. The b sheets superimpose very well but the loops differ considerably. Residues 35±41 of vMIP-II (the 30s loop) have distances with corresponding   RANTES Ca atoms greater 1.0 A, with the greatest values   ) and Lys37/Lys33 (2.4 A)   observed for Gln36/Ser232 (3.1 A of vMIP-II/RANTES. In the dimeric eotaxin-1 structure, an insertion results in structural differences in the 30s loop. The Ca of Lys33 in   eotaxin-1 is 2.1 A apart from the same residue of RANTES. Despite this difference, the two side chains extend from the backbone almost parallel to each other. The nature and orientation of this side chain is most similar between eotaxin-1 and the other dimeric chemokines. It is possible that a slight conformational change of the Phe11 and Lys33 could contribute to dimer stabilization, and this could explain, to some extent, why eotaxin-1 is in monomer± dimer equilibrium. We also examined the polar interactions that are formed at the intersubunit interface of dimeric CC chemokines. There are 8±10 hydrogen bonds for the four dimers (MIP-1b, RANTES, MCP-1, and the vMIP-II crystal structure). The vast majority of these are main chain (mc)±main chain interactions with only one side chain (sc)±mc hydrogen-bond in RANTES, none in MIP-1b, five in MCP-1, and three in the crystal structure of vMIP-II. Again these interactions are either between the N-termini of each subunit, or the N-terminus of the one subunit and the third b strand of the other. Formation of these interactions along with the hydrophobic surface complementarity previously discussed must be required for optimal packing of the monomers in the dimer. We infer from this analysis that the potential to form dimers might be greater than previously recognized for chemokines shown to be monomers under solution conditions. The aromatic residue following the CC sequence is crucial but probably not sufficient to drive dimer formation. Similarly, the complementary aromatic (and hydrophobic) binding site in the other subunit must assume an appropriate conformation for dimerization to occur in solution. Absence of these factors, however, do not preclude dimer formation under in vivo biological conditions, particularly in the presence of heparin sulfate or other glycosaminoglycans that are ubiquitously expressed and shown to induce oligomerization of certain chemokines [41,42]. The ability of chemokines to form different dimers based on their subfamily structure may be of biological significance. It has previously been suggested that the monomeric solution structure of vMIP-II may allow it to adopt a CC±dimeric structure for interacting with CC receptors or a CXC±dimeric structure for interacting with CXCR4 [33]. While the oligomeric state of activating chemokines on these G protein-coupled receptors is not yet resolved, almost all studies (including our own [43,44]) invoke a monomer as the binding ligand. Among the circumstantial evidence that supports monomers for both CXC and CC activity for chemokines include (a) low or no propensity for chemokine dimerization in solution [10,13], (b) a modified

IL-8 which is converted from a dimer to a monomer but retains full biological activity [11], and (c) a mutant of MCP-1 that also disrupts its dimerization in solution but retains biological activity [12]. However, there is some evidence that suggests dimers are active: (a) a noncovalent dimer of IL-8 possesses biological activity [45], and (b) cross-linking experiments that indicate IL-8 and MCP-1 bind to their receptors as dimers [35,36,46]. All of these studies attempt to infer what is happening on the receptor based on correlations between the association state of the chemokine in solution and its biological activity. A very recent example illustrates the danger of making these types of correlations. Acidic fibroblast growth factor, a protein agonist biochemically unrelated to chemokines, functions through a single transmembrane receptor and has been shown to be monomeric in solution. However, a heparinmodified dimer is responsible for activation of its receptor [47]. Chemokines are known to have high affinity to heparin and cell surface glycosaminoglycans, which affects their oligomerization [41] and modulates their cellular responses [42]. While there may be a variety of other roles for oligomerization, it may be necessary to re-examine the function of the quaternary structures of chemokines in the activation of their receptors. Comparison of the vMIP-II monomer to other CC chemokines The ability of vMIP-II to compete with so many chemokines for receptor binding invited a comparison (of the backbone atomic rmsd) between the mean structure of vMIP-II and the CC chemokine structures of MIP-1a (D26A) [38], MIP-1b [9], RANTES [25], HCC-2 [13], MCP-1 [40], and eotaxin-1 [10]. There is a low pairwise   rmsd value (from 0.43 to 0.68 A) for b sheet backbone atoms with all other CC chemokines (Table 2), indicating that the triple-stranded b sheet and its spatial arrangement are highly conserved. This conserved secondary structure is mainly stabilized by the hydrophobic core and the disulfide bonds. Residues that define the hydrophobic core (Trp31, Val43, Ile44, Phe45, Ala55, Trp61, Val62) along with the cysteines are among the most conserved residues in the CC chemokines, suggesting that this core plays an important role in the structural integrity of the proteins. After including the C-terminal a helix, the backbone rmsd values are significantly increased for all chemokines with the exception of MCP-1 and eotaxin-1. The large differences for MIP-1a, MIP-1b, RANTES, and HCC-2 are due to the hydrophobic packing of the helix against b strands. The side-chain packing between the a helix and b sheet has previously been shown to have substantial effects on the rmsd of backbone atoms for SDF-1a and other chemokines [44]. It was also shown in a structural comparison of RANTES and IL-8 that the decrease in volume of the side chain from phenylalanine in the C-terminal helix of IL-8 to   leucine in RANTES causes strand b1 to shift < 2 A toward the helix [25]. In HCC-2, the corresponding residue to Leu65 of vMIP-II is a cysteine, which forms the third disulfide bond for HCC-2 and results in a more compact interaction between the a helix and b sheet [13]. Inclusion of the loop connecting the strand b3 and the a helix (50s loop), and the loop connecting strands b2 and b3 (40s loop), results in large differences with MIP-1b and MIP-1a.

The changes in the 40s loop are associated with a change in the turn type from a type 3 : 5 hairpin b turn in vMIP-II to a series of bends in MIP-1a and MIP-1b, which has been shown to account for the structural variability in this region between RANTES and MIP-1b [25]. As previously noted, the most significant structural differences with respect to other chemokines are observed in the N-terminus and 30s loop (Fig. 3B). Part of the N-terminal region in dimeric chemokines MIP-1b, RANTES, and MCP-1 adopts a wellordered b strand structure due to subunit±subunit interactions. But like the other monomeric chemokines HCC-2 and eotaxin-1, vMIP-II displays a flexible N-terminus in solution. The 30s loop of vMIP-II also exhibits considerable flexibility within the family of 25 structures of vMIP-II. The N-terminal region is attached to the 30s loop through the disulfide bond (residues Cys14 and Cys38) that allows the 30s loop and the N-terminus to undergo codependent motion. These regions have been shown to be important in receptor binding and activation for other chemokines [48±51], and are likely to be involved in the function of vMIP-II mediated by some chemokine receptors. The structural source of receptor antagonism for CCR2 and CCR5 To more fully explore the relationship between vMIP-II and other CC chemokines (in the context of receptor binding selectivity), we analyzed the sequence and structure of chemokines. We reasoned that if related chemokines bind to a specific receptor in a similar manner, the amino-acid residues that comprise the receptor-binding surface would be similar or invariant. Of the receptors that interact with vMIP-II, we chose to focus on CCR2 and CCR5. These two receptors are activated by multiple chemokines, only one of which displays binding to both receptors. CCR2 is activated by MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4. CCR5 is activated by MIP-1a, MIP-1b, RANTES, and MCP-2. Functional

analysis of MCP-1 [12,35,52,53] and RANTES [50,54] analogues is also available that could aid our analysis. The ability of vMIP-II and MCP-2 to bind both CCR2 and CCR5 provides a unique opportunity to examine whether these two chemokines share similar binding epitopes with the other human chemokines. Previous studies of chemokines indicate that the flexible N-terminal region is involved in receptor binding and/or activation [49]. However, in most cases this region alone is insufficient for inducing binding or biological activity. The inclusion of residues up to the beginning of the first b strand (N-loop) increases activity, but is still not as potent as the full-length chemokine. Therefore, the receptorbinding surface must include other regions that are likely to be proximal to the N-terminus. HSQC experiments of the IL-8 [55] and fractalkine [14] with small peptides derived from their respective receptors are consistent with residues close to the N-terminus being involved in chemokine± receptor interactions. Structure-function studies of chemokine analogues have not been entirely successful at defining the entire receptor-binding site. Recent studies of growth hormone and its receptor indicate that the affinity between these molecules is largely due to the cumulative effect of a large number of residues that each contributes a small amount of binding free energy [56,57]. Only a few residues provide a large contribution to the free energy of binding. Consequently, mutational analysis of residues known from the crystal structure to be involved in growth hormone± receptor interactions was unable to identify most of the receptor binding residues due to the insensitivity of the analysis to small changes in the dissociation constant or biological activity. This may explain why only a few residues that do not appear to constitute a receptor-binding surface have been identified by mutational analysis to be involved in chemokine±receptor interactions. The presence of several activating chemokines for each receptor allows multiple sequence alignment to be used as

an alternative method to identify common residues that might be responsible for receptor binding, selectivity, and activation. Among the chemokines that activate CCR2 or CCR5 (but not both receptors), there are 38 and 27 invariant residues, respectively (Fig. 4A). To eliminate residues that are not likely to contribute to receptor selectivity, we deleted (a) amino acids that are invariant among all chemokines that activate CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5 (CC receptors that are confirmed to be inhibited by vMIP-II), and (b) amino acids from each group of chemokines that were present in at least one chemokine from the second group. We also found a number of other residues that were highly conserved within each group of chemokines and worthy of inclusion in the remaining set of residues. These included positions 44 (Lys or Arg), 47 (Val or Leu), and 69 (Lys or Arg) for CCR2-activating chemokines (numbering is based on the MCP-1 sequence), and 26 (Asp or Glu), 28 (Phe or Tyr), and 45 (Arg or Lys) for CCR5-activating chemokines (numbering is based on the RANTES sequence). This

remaining `restricted set of invariant residues' was reduced to 16 and 9 for CCR2 and CCR5, respectively, and is likely to be involved in selective interactions between the chemokines and the receptors. These residues were displayed on the three-dimensional structure of MCP-1 and RANTES, respectively, and a receptor-accessible surface was calculated (Fig. 4B). As shown, these residues occupy surface positions, consistent with the possibility that they may be involved in selective receptor interactions. Moreover, the positions that these residues occupy on each chemokine are similar, suggesting that the receptor-binding surface for each group of chemokines is similar. Our analysis can be put in a functional context by previous structure-function studies of MCP-1 and RANTES, which identified N-loop residues as important for receptor binding and biological activity. In MCP-1, a variety of studies implicate Val9, Tyr13, Arg24, Tyr28, and Arg30 as having a greater than 10-fold effect in receptor binding or biological activity [12,35,52,53]. For RANTES, mutational analysis

To eliminate complications due to MCP-2, which activates CCR2 and CCR5, this chemokine is omitted from the analysis. Invariant residues within each group of chemokines are shown in bold. A restricted set of unique, invariant residues that may be involved in receptor selectivity are shown in green (CCR2-activating chemokines) and red (CCR5-activating chemokines). To arrive at this restricted set of invariant residues, amino acids with the following criteria were omitted: (a) residues that were invariant among all CC chemokines (VMIP-II interacts with the CC chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5. Chemokines that interact with at least one of these receptors include MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, RANTES, eotaxin-1, and MPIF-2.) with which vMIP-II shares receptor binding (underlined in the MCP-2, eotaxin-1, and MPIF-2 sequences), or (b) invariant residues within one group of chemokines (CCR2- or CCR5-activating chemokines) that are also present in at least one chemokine from the other group of chemokines. The restricted invariant residues from each set of chemokines that are present in vMIP-II are shown in the same color scheme. (B) Ribbon diagram of MCP-1, vMIP-II, and RANTES.

identified distinct but overlapping epitopes that interact with CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 [50]. Tyr3, Asp6, Phe12, and Ile15 appear to be involved in receptor binding or biological activity mediated by CCR5. Our analysis also identifies Arg24 for MCP-1 and Asp6 for RANTES as potential receptor binding residues. The remaining residues identified by mutational analysis are contiguous to and may provide greater binding energy than the residues we identified. In an attempt to identify epitopes of vMIP-II and MCP-2 that are involved in specific interactions with CCR2 and CCR5, we compared their sequence and structural (vMIP-II only) properties to the CCR2- and CCR5-activating chemokines. Six of the nine residues displayed on vMIP-II are identical to CCR5-activating residues (Fig. 4B), suggesting that vMIP-II interacts with CCR5 in a manner similar to MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and RANTES. The absence from vMIP-II of a substantial surface area that is similar to `the restricted set of invariant residues' from CCR2-activating chemokines suggests that vMIP-II binds to CCR2 differently than the physiological agonists. Analysis of the sequence for MCP-2 results in a similar conclusion, but with reverse receptor-binding properties: MCP-2 possesses ten of the residues from the CCR2-activating chemokines, and only two of the residues from CCR5-activating chemokines. It is therefore likely that MCP-2 activates CCR2 similarly to the other monocyte chemoattractant proteins, but activates CCR5 much differently than MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and RANTES.
