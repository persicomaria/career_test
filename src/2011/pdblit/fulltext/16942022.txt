The X-ray crystal structures were solved for complexes with Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase of two bivalent tacrine derivative compounds in which the two tacrine rings were separated by 5- and 7-carbon spacers. The derivative with the 7-carbon spacer spans the length of the active-site gorge, making sandwich interactions with aromatic residues both in the catalytic anionic site (Trp84 and Phe330) at the bottom of the gorge and at the peripheral anionic site near its mouth (Tyr70 and Trp279). The derivative with the 5-carbon spacer interacts in a similar manner at the bottom of the gorge, but the shorter tether precludes a sandwich interaction at the peripheral anionic site. Although the upper tacrine group does interact with Trp279, it displaces the phenyl residue of Phe331, thus causing a major rearrangement in the Trp279Ser291 loop. The ability of this inhibitor to induce large-scale structural changes in the active-site gorge of acetylcholinesterase has significant implications for structure-based drug design because such conformational changes in the target enzyme are difficult to predict and to model.
Introduction The adverse effects of anticholinergic drugs on memory,1 taken together with postmortem data that revealed low levels of cholinergic markers in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD),2 led to the cholinergic hypothesis, which postulates that AD is associated with impairment of cholinergic transmission.3,4 It was, therefore, suggested that inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for the termination of synaptic transmission by rapid hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), might provide symptomatic relief, at least for early-stage AD patients. Indeed, all of the first-generation drugs approved for the management of AD were cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs).5,6 Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is an enzyme with high structural homology to AChE.7 Despite its wide tissue distribution, its precise biological function remains to be established.7 However, whereas AChE levels in the brains of AD patients are reduced, levels of BuChE are elevated.8 Indeed, there is evidence that inhibition of BuChE may also be advantageous in the treatment of AD patients.9,10 It has been demonstrated that AChE can accelerate the assembly of A to the amyloid fibrils, which are associated with plaque deposition in AD patients,11-13 and that the functional site in this process is the peripheral anionic site (PAS) at the entrance to the activesite gorge. Indeed, the capacity of intact AChE to promote A assembly can be mimicked by a hydrophobic peptide, part of whose sequence corresponds to the PAS of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE).14 Thus, the design of second-generation ChEIs for the treatment of AD should take into account not only the possible interaction with other targets, for example, nicotinic15 or glutamatergic16

receptors, but also the selectivity for AChE versus BuChE or for the PAS of AChE versus its catalytic anionic subsite (CAS). It may, in principle, be desirable to design inhibitors with either broad specificity for all three targets or narrow specificity for only one of them. Recent articles have indeed described the synthesis of selective inhibitors in this context.17-20 The use of ChEIs is also being explored for the treatment of other dementias and other neurological indications.9 The same considerations mentioned above in selecting a ChEI-type drug for the treatment of AD should also be applied in selecting one for the treatment of these other clinical targets. The bivalent ligand strategy involves the synthesis of drugs in which identical or different pharmacophores are linked via a suitable linker. This strategy takes advantage of the chelate effect21 to create a bifunctional ligand with enhanced affinity for its target. The geometry of the active-site gorge of AChE, with specific sites at its two extremities,22,23 makes it a particularly suitable target for applying this approach. Even before the 3D structure of AChE was known, bivalent ligands, such as decamethonium,24 BW284C51,25 and ambenonium26 were described, which displayed both high affinity and high selectivity for this enzyme. Recent examples of successful utilization of this strategy include 2f,27 the triazole-linked phenylphenanthridium-based inhibitor, syn-TZ2PA6, which displays a 77 fM binding constant for TcAChE,28 and a more potent triazole analogue with a dissociation constant of 33 fM for eel AChE.29 The development of bivalent AChE inhibitors as potential therapeutic drugs for AD has been recently reviewed.30 An important observation made in applying this strategy to AChE was that pharmacophores with weak affinities for AChE can serve as effective PAS-directed ligands when incorporated into a bivalent drug.31 Thus, in principle, one can design bivalent drugs, which, by spanning the active-site gorge, can inhibit the physiological actions of both the catalytic and peripheral sites. Furthermore, because aromatic residues, which are the principal elements of the PAS in vertebrate AChEs, are

Materials and Methods Crystallization and Data Collection. TcAChE was purified and crystallized as described.22 Inhibitors 2d and 2f were synthesized and characterized as previously reported.37 Soaking solutions were prepared by dissolving 2d and 2f in 40% PEG200 (v/v)/0.1 M MES buffer at pH 5.8, at concentrations of 2 and 0.5 mM, respectively. Trigonal TcAChE crystals were transferred to 6 µL drops of soaking solution at 4 °C and left overnight. The crystals were then transferred to oil, mounted on a nylon loop, and flash cooled in an Oxford Cryosystems cryostream. Data collection for the 2f/TcAChE complex was performed at the Weizmann Institute, using a RIGAKU RU-H3R running at 50 kV/100 mA with Osmic blue confocal optics at 120 K. Diffraction images were recorded on a RAXIS-IV++ (100 µ mode). Two crystals were used, and the data from both were combined into a unified set. Data for the 2d/TcAChE complex were collected at the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble, on beamline ID14-2 at 100 K, with an ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector. In both cases, the program STRATEGY38 was used to identify the optimal data collection protocol. DENZO and SCALEPACK39 were used to integrate and scale the data. Final data collection results are summarized in Table 2. Data were truncated with the CCP440 program TRUNCATE,41 and a list of randomly generated test reflections was added from a master list for the trigonal crystal form of TcAChE using CAD and FREERFLAG.42 Reflections were output with MTZ2VARIOUS to a format suitable for CNS. Structure Determination and Refinement for the 2f/ TcAChE Complex. The initial model for structure determination was taken from previous examples of the trigonal crystal form of TcAChE (based on PDB code 2ace) without solvent molecules, and carbohydrate residues. Rigid body refinement (CNS43) was used to check the handedness of the data and to account for slight deviations in cell constants. Initial electron density maps (2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc) were calculated, and the initial Fo-Fc map was used to fit two tacrine moieties to the density observed in the gorge, using the Xfit program.44 However, because no electron density was observed for the 7-carbon alkyl linker, it was removed from the model. The side chains of Trp279 and Phe330 were adjusted to move them from negative electron density peaks to nearby positive electron density peaks. Simulated annealing45 was performed for TcAChE with the partial inhibitor model, followed by individual B-factor refinement. At this stage, Rwork was 23.5%, and Rfree was 27.2%. As the map phases improved with subsequent refinement, the linker chain was gradually built into the ligand electron density, and water molecules were added. Refinement progressed until convergence of Rfree. For the final refinement step, occupancy for the ligand was set to 0.9 because of negative

lacking in the homologous BuChEs,7,32 one can design bivalent ligands with high selectivity for AChE relative to that for BuChE. Tacrine, as Cognex, was the first ChEI approved by the FDA for the management of AD.33 It has, however, been replaced by other ChEIs because of its hepatoxicity.34 Computational studies35 suggested that tacrine interacts with AChE, not only at the CAS, principally through a stacking interaction with Trp84,36 but also, with lower affinity, by interaction with the indole ring of Trp279 at the PAS. It was thus predicted that bis-tacrines in which the two pharmacophores were separated by a linker of a suitable length would have both greater inhibitory potency and selectivity than tacrine itself, a hypothesis that was confirmed via the synthesis and testing of a series of bis-(n)-tacrine congeners (Figure 1, Table 1).27,37 One of these compounds, heptylene-linked bis-tacrine, (2f), was indeed 150fold more active against rat AChE than tacrine and up to 250fold more selective for AChE than for BuChE.37 Pentylenelinked bis-tacrine (2d) was less potent and selective than 2f but was, nevertheless, an order of magnitude more potent and more selective than tacrine itself.37 In the following, we present and analyze the crystal structures of the complexes of 2d and 2f with TcAChE, viz. 2d/TcAChE and 2f/TcAChE, respectively. We show that the interactions of 2d with both the CAS and the PAS involve a drastic rearrangement of the protein structure, especially in the vicinity of the acyl binding pocket, whereas the binding of 2f can be accommodated with changes in the conformations of two side-chains in the active-site gorge. The structures of the two complexes, namely 2d/TcAChE and 2f/TcAChE, have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with accession codes of 2cmf and 2ckm, respectively.

carbohydrate moieties and 108 water molecules were fitted. The inhibitor molecule was refined at full occupancy. The initial difference map indicated a change in the conformation of the loop from Phe284 to Arg289 relative to its conformation in native TcAChE. These residues were, therefore, removed from the model during the early rounds of refinement and refitted in stages as refinement progressed. At the end of refinement, a composite omit map was calculated for the entire structure. The inhibitor is shown in Figure 3a, and the region of the Phe284-Ser291 loop is shown in Figure 3b. Results 2f/TcAChE Complex. The proximal tacrine ring of 2f is bound at the CAS, sandwiched between Trp84 and Phe330, very similarly to that in the tacrine/TcAChE structure (PDB code 1acj).36 No significant conformational changes in the residues of the catalytic triad were detected, and the water molecule observed in the native structure near the catalytic Ser200 is retained. The heptylene linker spans the aromatic gorge, connecting the tacrine rings bound at the PAS and CAS. No changes in the conformation of side chains lining the mid-portion of the gorge are observed relative to the native structure (Figure 4). The peripheral tacrine ring is bound at the PAS by stacking between Tyr70 and Trp279. For this interaction to occur, the side chain of Trp279 undergoes an 60° rotation about 1, and an 224° rotation about 2, relative to its conformation in native TcAChE (Figure 4). 2d/TcAChE Complex. The proximal ring of 2d is bound in the CAS similarly to the way it is bound both in tacrine/TcAChE and 2f/TcAChE. However, the distance between Ser200-O and H440-N 2 is 3.7 Å compared to 2.6 Å in 2f/TcAChE, 2.7 Å in native TcAChE (PDB code 2ace), and 3.3 Å in tacrine/TcAChE (PDB code 1acj). Thus, the catalytic triad is disrupted. In 2d/TcAChE, the main-chain atoms of Phe331 are displaced 1 Å toward the opening of the gorge, with respect to native TcAChE, presumably to alleviate the potential steric clash of its side chain with the distal tacrine moiety. The resultant 1.9 Å shift in the position of the phenyl ring of Phe331 appears, in turn, to produce an unfavorable steric contact with the side chain of Phe288. The alleviation of this clash has dramatic consequences, as discussed in the next section. In 2d/TcAChE, the distal tacrine moiety is stacked against the indole of Trp279. Interestingly, this interaction with Trp279 leaves the side-chain of this residue in its native conformation (Figure 5), differing from its conformation in both the tacrine/ TcAChE and 2f/TcAChE structures. The largest structural alterations, upon the binding of 2d to TcAChE, are observed in the Trp279-Ser291 loop,48 which bears residues of both the acyl pocket and the PAS. The backbone atoms in this region are displaced as much as 4.7 Å (Asp285CR) from their native positions, and the side-chains of Phe284, Phe288, and Phe290 are dramatically reoriented. The 1 Å movement of Phe331, induced by 2d (see above), results in a disruption of its stacking interaction with Phe288. To avoid steric clashes with Trp233 and Asn399, the CR of Phe288 moves 1.9 Å, and the side-chain is rotated 70° about 1 (Figure 6). To accommodate these movements, the main chain from Trp279 to Phe290 adopts a drastically altered conformation. At the distal end of the loop, Phe290 CR moves 0.6 Å, with a concomitant 180° rotation of the side-chain about 1 and the formation of an edge-face interaction with the indole ring of Trp279.

density (-4) for the tacrine bound at the PAS. Peak searches for water molecules were performed, with particular attention being paid to the region of the active site. Upon completion of refinement, 207 water molecules had been added. Final refinement results are summarized in Table 3. Finally, a simulated annealing omit map was calculated, excluding all atoms within a radius of 3.5 Å around the ligand (Figure 2). Structure Determination and Refinement for the 2d/ TcAChE Complex.

Rigid body refinement (CNS) was used to check the handedness of the data and to account for slight deviations in cell constants. Initial maps (Fo-Fc and 2Fo-Fc) showed unambiguous density for the inhibitor, allowing placement of both tacrine moieties and the linker group, making use of the XtalView program.44 As refinement progressed, two

Phe339, between Ile347 and Asn383 (which includes two helices), and from Leu516 to Thr535 (C-terminal) are all substantially shifted from their positions in the native structure. It should be noted that the second helix in the Ile347-Asn383 segment and that in the C-terminal segment are both part of the four-helix bundle involved in dimer formation. Discussion Increased Potency and Selectivity of 2f Results from the Binding of the Distal Tacrine Ring at the PAS. The observed increase in potency (150-fold) and selectivity (250-fold with respect to BuChE) of 2f over tacrine37 can clearly be ascribed to the interaction of its distal tacrine with both Trp279 and Tyr70 at the PAS of TcAChE. The nature of this interaction, assuming the distal tacrine ring is protonated, would be both a cation- and a - stacking interaction. The - stacking interactions are estimated to provide 2 kcal/mol of binding energy (see, for example, Boehr et al., 200250), equivalent to a 50-fold change in IC50. Hydrophobic interactions of the linker with gorge residues and entropy gained in displacing gorge-bound water molecules may also contribute to the enhanced affinity, although this will be offset somewhat by the loss of entropic freedom of the linker group. Moreover, the presence of the two binding moieties greatly increases the selectivity for AChE over BuChE because the latter does not possess a PAS. Somewhat longer bis(n)-tacrines (e.g., with linker groups of 8 or 9 carbon atoms) might be expected to make interactions similar to those made by 2f. This was indeed shown in a recent study that reported the crystal structure of the complex of TcAChE with NF595, a close homologue of 2f containing an 8-carbon spacer.51 But the longer linkers are likely to pay larger entropic costs when binding in the gorge. Thus, our analysis of the structural basis for both the binding mode and increased efficacy of 2f compared to those of tacrine supports the hypothesis generated by the original computational analysis27 and rationalizes the optimal binding of 2f. Disruption of the Catalytic Triad in 2d/TcAChE. Interestingly, although the binding of the tacrine moiety to the catalytic site appears to be similar in the three structures solved (complexes of tacrine, 2d, and 2f with TcAChE), there are significant differences in the position of the catalytic Ser200. While Ser200 O interacts with His440 N 2 in three structures, (native TcAChE ) 2.7 Å, tacrine/TcAChE ) 3.3 Å, 2f/TcAChE ) 2.6 Å), the binding of 2d appears to disrupt this interaction such that this distance becomes 3.7 Å. Ser200 O, in fact, is

The effect of this rearrangement on the surface of the activesite gorge is shown in Figure 7. The movement of Phe288 and Phe290 expands the volume of the acyl binding pocket, as can be seen in the lower part of the 3rd panel in Figure 7a and in the side view in Figure 7b compared to the corresponding views for the native enzyme in the upper panels in both figures and for 2f/TcAChE, in the corresponding middle panels. The rearrangement of the Trp279-Phe290 loop also results in movements in the more distal parts of the TcAChE molecule (Figure 8). Thus, the backbone atoms between Lys325 and

shifted towards the oxyanion hole, interacting with the mainchain nitrogen atoms of Ala201 (2.8 Å), Gly118 (3.3 Å), and Gly119 (3.5 Å), which are not noticeably displaced from their native positions. Binding of 2d to TcAChE Induces Unique Reorientations in the Active-Site Gorge. Despite the drastic rearrangements caused by the binding of 2d, the inhibitor was, nevertheless, shown to be 8-fold more potent and 30-fold more selective than tacrine in rat AChE.37 Presumably, the energetics of the - stacking between 2d and Trp279 and the newly formed edgeface interaction between Phe290 and Trp279 are strong enough to overcome the energy barrier involved in reorientation. Only two previous examples of significant movement of the acyl-binding loop have been observed in AChE crystal structures, both of which differ from that seen in the 2d/TcAChE complex. In the conjugate produced by the interaction of the organophosphate, diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) with

TcAChE, the crystal structure (PDB code 2dfp) shows that the isopropyl group of the covalently attached organophosphoryl moiety, which resides in the acyl binding pocket, clashes with the phenyl rings of Phe288 and Phe290. This results in the displacement of the backbone atoms of the acyl pocket by almost 5 Å,52 although the phenyl rings of both Phe288 and Phe290 maintain orientations similar to those that they assume in the native structure. There is, however, a substantial reorientation of the side chain of Arg289, whose CR is displaced by 4.8 Å. Recently, the crystal structure of the complex of 9-dehydro-6O-demethyl-6-O-(8-phthalimidooctyl)-galanthamine with TcAChE (PDB code 1w76) has been elucidated.53 The galanthamine moiety of the ligand is positioned just like native galanthamine in its complex with TcAChE.54 Consequently, the bulky phthalimido group is oriented towards the acyl binding pocket, and produces disorder in the Asp285-Phe288 loop, demonstrating the high degree of flexibility of this loop and showing a

possible pathway from the active site to the bulk solvent. Thus, the three crystal structures, taken together, provide evidence for the ability of the acyl binding loop to adopt multiple conformations of varying stability and suggest that its role in catalysis by AChE is worthy of more detailed study. Another example of inhibitor-induced movement involves the complex between mouse AChE and the syn-isomer of the gorgespanning ligand, TZ2PA6 (PDB code 1q83), prepared by in situ click chemistry.28 In this case, the linker between the tacrine

moiety at the bottom of the gorge and the phenathridinium group near its mouth pull the distal group downward, producing an unanticipated conformational change.55 In the complex, the indole group of Trp286 (homologous to Trp279 in TcAChE) is dislodged from its native position, forming a sandwich type interaction with the phenanthridinium moiety and Tyr72 (homologous to Tyr70 in TcAChE), although with the opposite face of the indole ring, relative to the 2f/TcAChE structure. In addition, the main-chain atoms of the dipeptide Tyr341-Gly342

The endocyclic nitrogens of the catalytic-site tacrine units in the 2d and 2f/TcAChE complexes are 2.9 and 3.0 Å, respectively, away from the carbonyl oxygen of His440. On the basis of these distances, it can be inferred that the tacrine moieties in the catalytic-site are protonated and donate a hydrogen bond to the His440 carbonyl oxygen. This is consistent with the fact that the conjugate acid of tacrine has a pKA of 9.8,56 and such a hydrogen bonding interaction would contribute to ligand affinity. A protonated N-alkyl tacrine, 3, would be expected to have maximal resonance stabilization if the N-alkyl substituent were roughly coplanar with the ring system (Figure 9). An intermediate dihedral angle is seen for the catalytic tacrine unit in the 2d/TcAChE complex (dihedral angle ) 135°, i.e., 45° out of coplanarity). However, for the catalytic tacrine unit of the 2f/TcAChE complex, a large deviation from coplanarity is seen (68°). It should be noted that in both cases, the fit of

these carbon atoms was based on electron density considerations, and no restraints were placed on the coplanarity of the exocyclic nitrogen substituents. The final simulated annealing omit maps are also consistent with noncoplanarity of the exocyclic nitrogen substituent, and the B-factors of the linker carbon atoms are comparable to the exocyclic nitrogen. Attempts to impose coplanarity on the exocyclic nitrogen substituent caused distortion of the ring carbon C9, with little movement of the linker carbon atom (data not shown). So the conformation of the linker appears to be secure. These results are also consistent with the crystal structures of complexes with AChE of similar compounds (Table 4 and Figure 10). To estimate the energetic penalty associated with these deviations from coplanarity, we performed density functional theory calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*//B3LYP/6-31G*)57 on protonated N-methyl tacrine (4), determining optimized geometries as the dihedral angle  was varied from 0 to 360° in 10° increments (see Supporting Information for computational details). These calculations estimate that the  ) 140° structure is only 1.5 kcal/mol above the global minimum, suggesting that the conformation adopted by the catalytic site tacrine in the 2d/ TcAChE complex is low in energy. However, the adoption of a 70° dihedral angle by 4 puts it 7.2 kcal/mol higher than the global minimum. Thus, it appears that a significant energetic penalty is associated with the conformation of the catalytic site tacrine in the 2f/TcAChE complex. This energetic penalty is not significantly reduced at B3LYP/6-31+G*//B3LYP/6-31G*, and the explicit inclusion of a formamide moiety (Figure 9,

formamide complex 5) to model the hydrogen bonding interaction with the His440 carbonyl reduces the penalty only slightly to 6.1 kcal/mol. A similar dihedral angle (73°) is observed for the presumably protonated peripheral site tacrine unit of the 2d/TcAChE complex. At this time, we are not able to account for these two unexpected dihedral angles in the tacrine dimer/ TcAChE complexes. Conclusions In summary, we have shown that the structural basis for the observation that 2f is an optimal inhibitor is that it forms favorable sandwich type stacking interactions in both the PAS and CAS with minimal protein rearrangement. 2d, which is less potent, has only a one-sided stacking interaction in the peripheral site and induces a conformational change in the protein backbone near the acyl binding pocket. The structural changes to the native enzyme observed in the two complexes as well as other complexes discussed in the text, highlight the limitations of inhibitor design based on the structure of the native enzyme.
