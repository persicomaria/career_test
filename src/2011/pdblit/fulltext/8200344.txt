The hybrid Bacillus (1,3 - 1,4)-P-glucanase H(A16-M), consisting of 16 N-terminal amino acids derived from the mature form of the B. amyloliquefaciens enzyme and of 198 C-proximal amino acids from the B. macerans enzyme, binds a calcium ion at a site at its molecular surface remote from the active center [T. Keitel, 0. Simon, R. Borriss & U. Heinemann (1993) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 90, 5287-52911. X-ray diffraction analysis at 0.22-nm resolution of crystals grown in the absence of calcium and in the presence of EDTA shows this site to be occupied by a sodium ion. Whereas the calcium ion has six oxygen atoms in its coordination sphere, two of which are from water molecules, sodium is fivefold coordinated with a fifth ligand belonging to a symmetry-related protein molecule in the crystal lattice. The affinity of H(A16-M) for calcium over sodium has been determined calorimetrically. Calcium binding stabilizes the native three-dimensional structure of the protein as shown by guanidinium chloride unfolding and thermal inactivation experiments. The enhanced enzymic activity of Bacillus P-glucanases at elevated temperatures in the presence of calcium ions is attributed to a general stabilizing effect by the cation.

204 of the calcium-substituted crystals showed H(A16-M) to adopt a compact `jellyroll' ,&sandwich fold with a deep active-site cleft crossing one surface and indeed revealed a Ca2+ binding site which was also present in a covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex and is distant from the active site (Keitel et al., 1993). A very similar protein architecture, but different cation binding sites, are observed in plant lectins (Becker and Reeke, 1989). Here we describe the crystal structure analysis by molecular replacement of the crystal form originally obtained in the absence of Ca". In these crystals the cation binding site is occupied by a sodium ion. The cation binding geometries in both protein forms, H(A16-M) . Ca" and H(A16-M) Na+, are analysed in detail, their three-dimensional structures are compared and implications for protein function are examined. In addition, the affinity of H(A16-M) for calcium and the stabilization of the three-dimensional protein structure by Ca2+binding are determined. of 2 mM EDTA. Crystals appeared within one week as long bars sized up to 0.2X0.3X2 mm. Diffraction data for H(A16-M) . Na' were measured from two crystals on an Enraf-Nonius (Delft) FAST television area detector system using graphite-monochromatized CuKa radiation from an Enraf-Nonius FR 571 rotating anode X-ray generator run at 45 kV and 65 mA at 0.2 mm focus. The cell constants in space group P2,2,2, were determined as a = 7.022 nm, b = 7.256 nm, c = 4.997 nm; lattice parameters of H(A16-M) . Ca" in the same space group are a = 6.432 nm, b = 7.852 nm, c = 3.930 nm (Keitel et al., 1993). Data were evaluated out to a nominal resolution of 0.2 nm. However, since the shell between 0.213-0.2 nm contains only 26% of the expected reflections and since the completeness of the 0.213-nm sphere is 86%, the effective resolution is 0.22 nm. For all 13440 independent significant ( l a level) intensitites derived from two crystals the internal consistency is R,,,, = 4.7%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Organisms, media and growth conditions
Two 5-ml portions of Luria-Bertani medium (Sambrook et al., 1989) containing 100 mg/l ampicillin were inoculated with H(Al6-M)-producing Escherichia coli DH5a (Olsen et al., 1991) from single colonies, incubation over night at 37°C with shaking before transfer to 2 1 of the same medium. The culture was incubated at 37°C for 2-3 days. It was used as inoculum for 100-1 fermentation in minimal medium M9 (Sambrook et al., 1989) containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin in a 150-1 Chemap fermenter (heighudiameter 3 :1). The cells were cultured for 3 days at 3 7 ° C pH 7.0, with an airflow of 150 l/min.

Protein purification
Upon fermentation, the cells were separated from the supernatant in a Westfalia CSA-8 plate centrifuge (9200 rpm) and passed through a filter with a pore size of 5 pm. The cell-free culture fluid was concentrated 50-fold followed by dialysis against 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 1 mM CaC1,. The sample was loaded onto a column (5x13 cm) packed with S-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) cation exchanger equilibrated with 20mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 1 mM CaC1,. Bound protein was eluted with 50mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0,50 mM NaC1, 5 mM CaC1,. Fractions containing (1,3 - 1,4)-P-glucanase activity were pooled, concentrated and loaded onto a Sephacryl S200 HR (Pharmacia) gel filtration column (5 X 100 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 1 mM CaCl,. The proteins were eluted with the equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 100 mvh. Fractions containing active (1,3 - 1,4)-/?-glucanase were pooled, and one band of 24kDa was identified after SDSRAGE. MAC and AMY were produced and purified according to Olsen et al. (1991).

Crystallization and acquisition of X-ray diffraction data
Single crystals of H(A16-M) were grown from a concentrated protein solution (70 mg/ml) at pH 7 by vapor-phase equilibration with 13-19% poly(ethy1ene glycol) in a procedure essentially described by Keitel et al. (1991). Divalent ions were removed from the protein solution by the presence

Molecular replacement and structure refinement
The atomic coordinates of the protein molecule as derived from the crystal structure of H(A16-M) . Ca2+(Keitel et al., 1993) were used for structure determination of H(A16M) . Na+ by molecular replacement. Rotation and translation functions were calculated with diffraction data between 1.O0.4 nm, and Patterson correlation refinement (Briinger, 1990), as implemented in X-PLOR, used data from 1.20.3-nm resolution. There was one clear solution which was confirmed by rigid-body refinement and subsequent slowcooling simulated-annealing refinement with X-PLOR (Briinger et al., 1987, 1990). Refinement was completed by restrained least-squares refinement with PROFFT (Hendrickson, 1985; Finzel, 1987) and by manual model corrections and additions guided by electron density maps displayed with FRODO (Jones, 1978). Details of the refinement process and of the stereochemistry of the final protein model may be taken form Table 1. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for H(A16-M) . Na' have been submitted with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.

Identification of bound cation
Special care was taken to model the solvent sphere around H(A16-M). The initial assumption was that, in the absence of Ca2+ from the crystallization buffer and in the presence of 2 mM EDTA, the calcium binding site identified earlier (Keitel et al., 1993) would be empty or saturated with water molecules. In the new crystal packing, however, the side chain of Tyr56 from a different molecule has moved in close to the cation binding site with its 01 function pointing 1 towards a prominent difference electron density peak. Several options were examined to interpret this difference density which is also in close proximity with several protein oxygen atoms involved in Ca2+ binding in the other crystal form. (a) For a water molecule the peak-oxygen distances are too short resulting in a repulsion of the water oxygen from the peak position with high B value and persistent difference density. (b) A Ca" can occupy the peak position, but acquires a B value > 0.3 nm', much higher than those of the bound protein oxygens. The presence of Ca2+is furthermore made very unlikely by the fact that EDTA, but no calcium salts, were present in the crystallization buffer and by the very unusual coordination geometry (see below). (c) A Na+ ideally satisfies the difference density, yields reasonable cat-

ion-ligand distances and coordination geometry and is possible for chemical reasons, since the protein was buffered with the sodium salt of Mes resulting in a final sodium concentration of 17 mM. No other cation with similar ionic radius, coordination geometry and number of electrons was added to the protein buffer. We may thus conclude that in the present crystal form the cation binding site of H(A16-M) is occupied by Na+.

prior to filtration. The exact concentration of Gdn . HC1 was determined by refractive index using the equation of Nozaki (1972): [Gdn . HCI] = 57.147X(An)+38.68X(dn)2-91.60 X ( ~ l n ) where An is the difference of refractive index be~, tween the buffer B and the buffer A. Solutions were prepared few days before use, and the same solutions were used throughout each experiment.

Preparation of buffers for stability experiments
Solutions of buffer A (50 mM Mes, 5 mM CaCl,, adjusted to pH 6.0 with 4 M NaOH) and buffer B (8 M Gdn . HC1, 50 mM Mes, 5 mM CaCl,, adjusted to pH 6.0 with 4 M NaOH) were prepared. Adjustment of pH with NaOH resulted in a final concentration of Na' of 22mM. All solutions were passed through a bottle filter system I1 (Costar) equipped with a 0.22-pm filter. For unfolding experiments without Ca2+,the solutions were prepared without Ca". To remove traces of Ca2+,solutions were treated with Chelex 100 (BioRad), removing all divalent ions; 5 g Chelex 100 resin was added100 ml solution, followed by stirring for 1 h

Removal of calcium from H(A16-M) Purified and lyophilized H(A16-M) was dissolved in 1 ml buffer A without calcium, and residual buffer from purification of the protein was removed using a NAP-10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A without calcium. To remove Ca2+ bound to the protein, the solution was loaded onto a Chelex-100 column (1.6X10 cm) equilibrated with Chelex-100-treated buffer A. The protein was eluted at a flow rate of 20 mVh using the equilibration buffer. Enzyme assay All assays were performed in triplicate. Determination of (1,3 - 1,4)-P-glucanase activity was performed using a kit for

206 the assay of malt /I-D-glucanase (Megayme) essentially according to the manufacturer's recommendations, except that 1-25 ml of sample containing (1,3 -1,4)-/I-glucanase were incubated in 200 ml 50 mM Mes, pH 6.0, 5 mh4 CaC1, and 200 ml Azo-barley glucan substrate. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml precipitant [0.3 M sodium acetate, 20 mM zinc acetate, pH 5.0, 80% (by vol.) 2-methoxyethanol]. sional profile method of Luthy et al. (1992) shows the entire length of the polypeptide chain to yield the expected positive score (Fig. 1). In the Ramachandran diagram (Fig. 2), all backbone torsion angles for non-glycine residues fall in the a-helix and /I-sheet regions with the exception of five residues separated in sequence which adopt left-handed a-helix conformation. The mean error in the atomic coordinates of H(A16-M) Na' according to Luzzati (1952) is 20 pm. The N-terminal Gln is poorly defined with crystallographic temperature factors reaching 0.63 nm2. Water oxygen atoms have B values between 0.08-0.50 nm'. The protein conformation in H(A16-M) . Na' is very similar to that in H(A16-M) . Ca2+ (Keitel et al., 1993). In Fig. 3 the view is edge on to the 'jellyroll' /I-sandwich formed by two curved, strictly antiparallel seven-stranded psheets. The space between the sheets which appears to be empty in the schematic drawing is filled with hydrophobic residues not included in the picture. The deep channel on the left side of the molecule has been identified as the enzyme active site (Keitel et al., 1993). The sodium atom binds to a site on the 'back' side of the /I-sandwich. The side chain of Tyr56 and a portion of the loop to which it is attached in a different molecule in the crystal lattice is also shown in the figure, since this residue participates in Na+ binding. A least-squares superposition of H(A16-M) . Ca" onto H(A16-M) . Na+ (Fig. 4) reveals close similarity of the two forms of the protein. The root-mean-square distance between equivalent a-carbon atoms is 40 pm. Throughout most of the polypeptide chain the observed differences in backbone conformation are within the experimental error. Exceptions are the N-terminal tripeptide which is poorly defined in both crystal forms, some loop regions and, notably, some parts of the structure in which the cation-liganding residues are anchored (see below). Around Gly45 and Tyr56 the protein conformation has significantly changed, whereas it remains unaltered near Asp207. The most prominent conformational difference between the two protein forms is observed between Pro9, contacting the bound cation, and Thrl7. In this region structural changes with differences in backbone torsion angles exceeding 40" occur in the tripeptide Asnl4Serl5-Glyl6 where the peptide unit connecting the latter two residues flips over by roughly 180".

Determination of the binding constant of calcium to H(A16-M) Isothermal titration calorimetry (Freire et al., 1990) in an Omega titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Wiseman et al., 1989) was used in order to determine the binding constant. 1.3558 ml 22 pM active H(A16-M) in 50 mM Mes, pH 6.0 was titrated by 20 1 2 . 5 ~ injections of 600 pM CaCl,. After 1 each injection, the heat generated by binding of the Caz+ to H(A16-M) was measured. All measurements were performed at 25°C. Using software developed by MicroCal the thermodynamic values were calculated.
Guanidinium-chloride-mediatedunfolding and refolding experiments The 3-ml preparations of enzyme, buffer A and B were mixed to a final protein concentration of 0.5-1 pM; 30-40 preparations of increasing Gdn . HC1 concentration were made for each experiment. The preparations were incubated at 25 "C over night. Refolding experiments were performed by incubating protein in 7.5 M Gdn . HC1 over night, followed by dilution with buffer A to varying concentrations of Gdn . HC1 and a protein concentration of 0.5-1 pM and incubation at 25 "C for 24 h. The final protein concentrations for unfolding and refolding were identical. In order to follow unfolding of the proteins, emission at 330 nm in a band width of 5 - 8 nm was measured in a quartz cuvette (1.OX 1 .O cm) upon excitation at 280 nm in a band width of 5 - 8 nm using a Luminescence spectrometer LS 50 B (Perkin-Elmer) set at 25 "C. Fluorescence of preparations containing increasing concentrations of Gdn . HC1 without protein was measured in order to determine the fluorescence of Gdn . HC1.

Thermal stability experiments Thermal stability of the (1,3 -1,4)-/I-glucanasewas determined by measuring the rate of irreversible inactivation at 70°C. Enzyme preparations of 100 p1 each containing 10 pg purified enzyme were incubated in 50 mM Mes pH 6.0. In the case of stability experiments with calcium, the incubation buffer contained 5 mM CaC1,. Aliquots were withdrawn periodically and placed on ice. The percentage of remaining enzymic activity relative to zero time was calculated. RESULTS Tertiary structure of H(Al6-M) Na' At an effective resolution of 0.22 nm, the crystal structure of the hybrid (1,3-1,4)-/I-glucanase H(A16-M) is reliably determined as judged from the crystallographic R value, the electron density map and model stereochemistry. After an additional simulated annealing run starting from the final model at 3000 K the free R value (Briinger, 1992) was 22.5%. An analysis of the protein fold with the three-dimen-

Molecular packing in the two crystal forms of H(A16-M)
Upon addition of 2.5 mM calcium chloride to the crystals of H(A16-M) . Na' the unit cell shrinks by 22% through a change in cell parameters from a = 7.022 nm, b = 7.256 nm, c = 4.997 nm to a = 6.432 nm, b = 7.852 nm, c = 3.930 nm with unchanged space group P2,2,2, (Keitel et al., 1993). This change in crystal packing is accompanied by a slight reorientation and a more pronounced translational rearrangement of protein molecules (Fig. 5). The most important effect of this rearrangement is a change in the vicinity of the cation binding site where a crystal contact involving the side chain of Tyr56 is removed. The number of lattice contacts experienced by a protein molecule is smaller in the larger unit cell of H(A16-M) Na+ than in H(A16-M) . Ca2+crystals. There are 7 direct and 14 water-mediated hydrogen bonds in the former versus 12 direct and 28 hydrogen bonds through water molecules in the latter when a cutoff distance of 0.35 nm for a hydrogen bond is used in the analysis. Almost all of these contacts involve side-chain atoms. The only main-chain-main-chain interac1

The different conformations of the N-terminal tripeptide which interacts with the loop between Thrl69 and Asnl71 in the calcium form crystals but has no lattice contacts in H(A16-M) .

Geometry of cation binding to H(A16-M)
The cation binding sites are well defined by electron density in both H(A16-M) . Na' and H(A16-M) . Ca2+(Fig. 6). In both crystal forms, the ions bind by inner-sphere coordination with the carbonyl oxygens of Pro9, Gly45 and Asp207 and with the carboxylate oxygen 061 of Asp207. Caz+ is further coordinated to the oxygen atoms of water molecules Wat238 and Wat287, whereas Na' is bound to the phenolic oxygen of the Tyr56 side chain from a different molecule in the crystal lattice. Hence Ca2+is present in sixfold coordina-

208 the intramolecular mode of Ca2+ binding (neglecting the water molecules) explains the dramatic change of unit cell parameters upon exchange of the cation. The coordination of both cations with protein and water oxygen atoms is in the form of regular polyhedra (Fig. 7). In Na' binding, Asp207 061 and Pro9 0 occupy the axial positions of a trigonal bipyramid centered about the cation, whereas Gly45 0,Asp207 0 and Tyr56 Oq, the latter belonging to a different protein molecule in the lattice, occupy the equatorial positions. The characteristic 0-Na+-0bond angles (standard deviations in parentheses) are 90(5)", 120(17)" and 169" (Table 2). In Caz+ binding, the six oxygen atoms form an octahedron around the cation. Here the characteristic 0Ca2'-0 bond angles are 90(9)" and 167(9)". Mean Na+-0 distances are 0.23(1) nm, and mean Caz+0 distances are 0.250(9) nm in their respective coordination spheres (Fig. 8). Within the experimental limits these values are typical for Na+ or Ca2+bound to oxygen atoms in both proteins and small-molecule model compounds (Glusker, 1991; Einspahr and Bugg, 1981; Hori et al., 1988). Both cations show unidentate coordination in anti orientation (Carre11 et al., 1988; Chakrabarti 1990b) with the Asp207 carboxylate group.

Na' is 1.3X105 times lower than that for Ca". During passage of H(A16-M) through the Chelex 100 column all of the protein was recovered but two-thirds of the enzyme activity was lost. This may be due to misfolding of the protein when Ca2+is removed. None of the lost activity could be regained by incubation in buffer A for 1h at 25°C. The inactivation was therefore considered irreversible. When a CaC1, solution was injected during titration, Na' was replaced by Caz+ and the heat developed by the replacement was measured. Complete removal of both Ca2+ and Na+ will probably lead to a Pro-9 Pro-3 complete enzyme inactivation. Therefore it is not possible to determine the absolute value of the binding constant of Ca2+ to H(A16-M) using isothermal titration calorimetry. All measurements were performed at 25"C, and the heat developed or consumed was determined from the amount of power used after each injection to keep the temperature of the solution at 25°C. The concentration of H(A16-M) able to bind Ca" was calculated from the titration experiment (Fig. 9 b) based on the assumption that one protein molecule binds one Caz+ atom as observed in the crystal structure. This concentration was found to be 22pM, a concentration also determined through (1,3 - 1,4)-P-glucanase activity measurements (data b not shown). This indicates that onlv the active enzyme is able to bind Ca". In order to measke the heat of dilition of Fig. 7 Coordination polyhedra of H(Al6-M) with Ca2+ Na+.

process so that the heat transfer to the solution after injection is negative (Fig. 9b). Therefore, the heat transfer to the protein solution becomes positive as H(A16-M) becomes saturated with Ca". From the raw data presented in Fig. 9 b the accumulated heat from exchange of Na+ to Ca" in H(A16M) can be calculated (Fig. 9c). The line is the fit to a single binding event. Replacement of Na+ with Ca" in H(A16-M) (exothermic process) is seen as a downward slope on the first part of the curve. As all the protein becomes saturated with Ca", the heat of dilution from the injections of Ca" becomes dominant and the curve turns upward. Calculated values for the best fit of the parameters are summarized in Table 3.

H(A16-M) . Na+ and H(A16-M) . Ca" both unfold in a two-state process at 25 "C in increasing concentrations of Gdn . HC1 as judged from the unfolding/refolding pattern (Fig. 10a). Refolding of the two enzymes each follows the same pattern as for unfolding which is taken as evidence for reversibility of the process. MAC follows unfolding and refolding characteristics similar to those of H(A16-M) . Na'

and H(A16-M) . Ca" (Fig. l l a ) while AMY follows a different refolding than unfolding pattern (Fig. 11b). The same unfolding/refolding pattern for AMY was found for incubation times of 1 h and 24 h in Gdn . HC1, indicating that the observed difference in unfolding and refolding patterns is not due to differences in the kinetics of the two processes but rather to different unfolding/folding paths. Furthermore, the transition region for unfolding of AMY was in the range 2M<[ Gdn . HC1]<4M compared to 2M<[Gdn . HCl] < 3 M for the other enzymes investigated. AG for unfolding at 25°C was calculated for H(A16-M) . Na+, H(A16M) . Ca2+and MAC using the equations of Pace et al. (1990). AG can only be calculated in the transition region between the folded and the unfolded state. AG(H,O) therefore has to be calculated by extrapolation of the data given in the transition region to zero concentration Gdn HC1 (Fig. lob). Several methods to estimate AG(H,O) by extrapolation have been reviewed by Pace (1986). For all experiments described here AG was shown by single regression analysis to have a linear dependence on [Gdn . HCl] with a strong statistical significance (>99.9%). Estimations of AG(H,O), the dependence of AG on [Gdn . HCl] ( m ) and the midpoint of the unfolding curve [Gdn . HC1],,z are listed in Table 4. Due

with Tukey's test showed with a strong statistical significance (>99.9%) that the level of AG, = for H(A16-M) . Na+ is lower than that of AG, for H(A16-M) .

Na' is significantly lower than that of H(A16-M) . Ca2+. The influence of calcium on resistance of H(Al6-M) against irreversible thermal denaturation was determined by incubating either 10 Fg H(A16-M) . Na' or H(A16-M) .

MAC and AMY followed inactivation profiles previously found by Olsen et al. (1991). During heating, aggregation of the proteins occurred which was observed as a precipitate. Least precipitate was observed in samples containing H(A16-M) . Ca2+ as judged by eye. It could not be determined whether MAC, AMY or H(A16-M) . Na' gave the most precipitate during heating.

213 identified on the surface of the hybrid Bacillus (1,3 - 1,4)-/3glucanase that can accommodate both cations. The minimum binding site is comprised of the backbone carbonyl oxygens of amino acids Pro9, Gly45 and Asp207 and by the carboxylate oxygen 061 of Asp207. The binding site for calcium is completed by two water molecules, whereas that for sodium is completed by oxygen Oy of the Tyr56 side chain from a different protein molecule. Octahedral coordination of calcium by six oxygen atoms as observed in H(A16-M) . Ca" is very common in proteins (McPhalen et al., 1991). Along with sevenfold coordination in the form of a pentagonal bipyramid, it constitutes one of two canonical binding geometries. Slightly atypical is the involvement of only one carboxylate group in concert with backbone carbonyls, since the presence of two or more Asp or Glu side chains in a calcium coordination sphere is the more common case (McPhalen et al., 1991). The remarkable change in crystal lattice parameters brought about by relatively small concentrations of calcium can be explained by the significantly larger affinity of H(A16-M) for Ca2+over Na+ and by the geometric requirements for calcium binding sites. Whereas Ca2+ has a strict requirement for six or more coordinative ligands, Na+ can exist in a four or five-coordinated form (Glusker, 1991). When calcium replaces sodium in the binding site of H(A16M), water molecules approach to complete the Ca2+coordination sphere, and their binding precludes further binding of the Tyr56 phenolic hydroxyl group. Preferred binding of Ca2+ over Na' is generally observed in proteins and other organic molecules, since sodium-specific binding sites have to meet very narrow stereochemical requirements (Lehn and Sauvage, 1975). The estimated dG(H,O) values for H(A16-M) . Ca2+, MAC and AMY are in agreement with results from the thermoinactivation experiments and earlier work demonstrating that H(A16-M) . Ca2' is more stable than both MAC and AMY (Olsen et al., 1991; Politz et al., 1993). When calcium is removed from H(A16-M) and replaced by sodium the resistance against irreversible thermal denaturation is much lower than that of MAC and AMY, demonstrating the importance of calcium in stabilizing the enzyme against thermal inactivation as shown for other (1,3 - 1,4)-/3-glucanases including MAC and AMY by Borriss et al. (1989). This is in contrast to the estimation of dG(H,O) for MAC and AMY which are both lower than that of H(A16-M) . Na'. However, unfolding in Gdn . HC1 is a reversible process (Figs 10a and 11) where an equilibrium for the protein is reached at each concentration of Gdn . HC1 whereas thermal denaturation in the experiment described here is an irreversible process. Thermal denaturation is irreversible because of aggregation of denatured protein which occurs as a secondary process during heating (Klibanov and Ahern, 1987) and deamidation of Asn and Gln residues which may occur at pH 6.0 as demonstrated by Tomazig and Klibanov (1988). It seems from the experiments on stability presented here that Ca2+bound to H(A16-M) stabilizes the three-dimensional protein structure and prevents aggregation and possibly also deamidation of Asn and Gln residues at elevated temperatures leading to increased thermostability. Caz+ cannot be directly involved in the reaction mechanism of H(A16-M), since the ion binding site is far from the active site. Instead, cleavage of the glycosyl bond in a nucleophilic displacement reaction with the carboxylate of Glu105 at the substrate anomeric carbon followed by a second displacement reaction involving a water molecule which is possibly activated by the side chain of Glu109, is consistent with the available crystallographic (Keitel et al., 1993) and biochemical evidence (H@j al., 1991,1992; Plaet nas et al., 1992).
