Gp., SERC Daresbury Lab., Wanington WA4 4AD, Cheshire, U.K. Dissimilatory nitrite reductase (NiR) has been isolated from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans (NCIMB 11015) (Ax) after activation of crude extracts by addition of CuSO,. Ax NiR, after purification to >90% homogeneity, had a specific activity of 150-300 pmoles NO; reduced/min/mg.protein which was 6-12 fold higher than that reported earlier [l]. SDS-PAGE and spray mass spectrometry showed a subunit M, = 36.5 kDa. X-ray scattering data were modelled using the crystal structure data [2] for NiR from Achromobacter cycloclastes (AC) and showed that at >5 mg/ml Ax NiR is a trimer in solution. Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation confirmed this structure in solution at 0.5 nigiml. Oxidized Ax NiR showed visible absorption maxima at 460 nm, 593 nm and 770 nm. Solutions had a strong blue colour in contrast to the green colour of AC and other NiR's [2]. The Cu content of Ax NiR was 3.5ti.8 Cu atomtirimer and EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of both type 1 (gr = 2.208, A, = 6.3 mT) and type 2 (gi = 2.298, A, = 14.2 mT) Cu centres in contrast to earlier reports [1] that only type 1 Cu centres were present. When Ax NiR was isolated from crude extracts not activated by the addition of CuSO, the purified enzyme contained 2 Cu atomsArimer and had a specific activity of 21 units/mg. UV/visible spectroscopy indicated that activated and unactivated NiR had similar type 1 Cu contents but EPR spectroscopy showed lo-fold less type 2 Cu in unactivated NiR. Activation by CuSO, clearly results in a lo-fold increase in activity which appears to be correlated with the type 2 Cu content. It seems probable that the unactivated species corresponds to that described earlier [1] although the presence of type 2 Cu was not then observed.
