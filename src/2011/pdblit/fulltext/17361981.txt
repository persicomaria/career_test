Protonation Patterns in Tetracycline:Tet Repressor Recognition: Simulations and Experiments
Alexey Aleksandrov,[a] Juliane Proft,[b] Winfried Hinrichs,*[b] and Thomas Simonson*[a]
Resistance to the antibiotic tetracycline (Tc) is regulated by its binding as a Tc:Mg2 + complex to the Tet Repressor protein (TetR). Tc:TetR recognition is a complex problem, with the protein and ligand each having several possible conformations and protonation states, which are difficult to elucidate by experiment alone. We used a combination of free-energy simulations and crystallographic analysis to investigate the electrostatic interactions between protein and ligand and the possible role of induced fit in Tc binding. Tc in solution was described quantum mechanically, while Tc:TetR interactions were described by a recent, high-quality molecular-mechanics model. The orientations of the amide and imidazole groups were determined experimentally by a careful analysis of Debye≠Waller factors in alternate crystallographic models. The agreement with experiment for these orientations suggested that the simulations and their more detailed, thermodynamic predictions were reliable. We found that the ligand prefers an extended, zwitterionic state both in solution and in complexation with the protein. Tc is thus preorganized for binding, while the protein combines lock-and-key behavior for regions close to the ligand's amide, enolate, and ammonium groups, with an induced fit for regions close to the Mg2 + ion. These ACHTUNGREinsights and the modeling techniques employed should be of interest for engineering improved TetR ligands and improved TetR proteins for gene regulation, as well as for drug design.

Introduction
Tetracycline (Tc) is one of the most important antibiotics in use today,[1≠3] its bacteriostatic function being based on inhibition of polypeptide elongation by the bacterial ribosome. Over one thousand Tc varieties have been synthesized, but only about ten have proved useful, as broad-spectrum antibiotics for humans and livestock. Tc resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is regulated by the Tet Repressor protein (TetR). TetR binds specifically to DNA, repressing both its own expression and that of the cytoplasmic membrane protein TetA, which exports Tc out of the cell. When Tc enters the cell, it binds to TetR, inducing conformational changes that sharply reduce the TetR:DNA affinity.[4] TetR is then released from the DNA and expression of TetA can proceed, conferring resistance. Today, the TetR/Tc system is of general interest because of widespread application in molecular and cell biology as a sensitive switch for target gene regulation.[5, 6] It is thus of great interest to increase our understanding of Tc:TetR binding, but Tc:TetR recognition is a complex problem and several important questions remain open. We focus here on protonation states and side chain conformations in the binding pocket and their possible changes in the protein:ligand binding reaction, a question with general implications for molecular recognition and drug design. Tcs are large, complex molecules, with two main conformations and two main protonation states at neutral pH; these conformations and/or protonation states may change when

the Tc binds to TetR. Similarly, protein groups in the Tc binding pocket have several possible orientations and protonation states, which could also change when Tc binds.[7] While crystal structures of TetR have provided essential information,[4, 8, 9] and biochemical and thermodynamic data are also available,[10≠14] these data do not reveal the protonation states of Tc or the protein side chains, nor the orientations of several key recognition residues.[12] In particular, two orientations are possible for Asn, Gln, and His side chains close to the ligand. Furthermore, the predominant Tc conformation and protonation state in solution are not known, so that its preorganization for binding cannot be assessed. All these unknown features have to do with the electrostatic properties of the ligand and the binding pocket; indeed, protonation of a histidine side chain or transfer of a proton from one Tc group to another do not change the shapes of the two partners, but they have a large impact on the electrostatic field and potential in the binding pocket.

T. Simonson et al. change in any of these properties induced by the Tc:TetR binding reaction can thus be viewed as an electrostatic induced fit. In contrast, if the electrostatic state of the partners is maintained, then the partners effectively function as an electrostatic lock and key. Computer simulations can be used to investigate electrostatic interactions in complex systems such as these.[15, 16] Several computational studies of Tc have been reported,[17≠21] but work on Tc in interaction with its biological partners has been limited to two very recent studies of the allosteric properties of TetR.[22, 23] This is due to the considerable difficulty involved, with a molecule as complex as Tc, in the development of a molecular-mechanics forcefield of sufficient quality for quantitative molecular recognition studies. We recently reported such a force field[24] that is compatible with and of the same quality as current protein forcefields. It has been tested for molecular recognition between Tc and the ribosome, giving good agreement with experiment (A.A. and T.S., unpublished results). To investigate the protonation patterns and conformational states in the Tc:TetR complex, we have performed both molecular dynamics free-energy simulations and crystallographic calculations. Free-energy simulations have matured significantly in recent years and represent a valuable tool, complementary to experimentation,[25≠29] that allows the Tc binding free energy to be computed as a function of its protonation state and the protonation and conformational states of the binding pocket. Two different free-energy methods, using either an explicit treatment of aqueous solvent or a continuum dielectric treatment, have been employed. We have also computed the structure and protonation state of Tc in solution, using a quantum mechanical treatment of Tc and a continuum dielectric treatment of the solvent.[30] By combining these data, we predict the most stable form of the TetR:Tc complex and the extent of protein and ligand preorganization. To test the simulation results, crystallographic refinements have also been performed, through the use of X-ray diffraction data to a resolution of 1.89 . We have constructed two models of the binding pocket, both of which are compatible with the experimentally determined electron density, but which differ in the orientations of His, Asn, and Gln side chains in the binding pocket. Indeed, these side chains can be flipped by 1808 and still occupy the same space within the electron density map. Nevertheless, through a systematic refinement of the two models and a careful analysis of the resulting thermal disorder parameters, the correct orientations of these groups can be deduced. If, for example, an Asn side chain is flipped with respect to the correct structure, so that the terminal OD1 and ND2 atoms are interchanged, the refined Debye≠Waller factors will reveal the mismatch, with the heavier OD1 having an artificially enlarged Debye≠Waller factor. Simulations and ACHTUNGREexperiment have been found to be in good agreement. The structure, fluctuations, and thermodynamics that emerge from the data have then been analyzed to identify the interactions that govern the binding affinity of Tc for TetR. We have found that the protonation states and conformations both of the ligand and of a large portion of the binding pocket do not change upon binding, but are preorganized. In contrast, side chains close to the Mg2 + ion are already known, from the available X-ray structures, to reorganize upon binding, as confirmed by the simulations, so the system has features both of an induced fit and of a lock-and-key. These insights and the modeling techniques employed should be of interest for engineering of improved TetR ligands, improved TetR proteins, and for drug design in general.

Results
TetR:Tc binding: free-energy calculations We considered several modes of Tc binding, involving two Tc protonation states (TcN, TcZ), three protonation states for nearby His64, and two orientations for the nearby Asn82. All these degrees of freedom are difficult to deduce from the available medium-resolution TetR:Tc crystal structures, because they involve the positions of hydrogens. Views of Tc and the binding pocket are shown in Figure 1, the different states are

Protonation in Tetracycline:Tet Repressor Recognition schematized in Figure 2 (the states that were directly compared are connected by arrows), while free-energy results are summarized in Figure 3. We used the rigorous, but expensive, MDFE technique to compare one TcN state (model N3 ; Figure 2) and two TcZ states (models Z2 and Z3), and a faster but more approximate method--PBLRA--to compare all three TcN and TcZ states systematically. Where comparable, the two methods agree very well. We first consider the three TetR complexes with TcN, and then the complexes with TcZ. Finally, we compare the TcN complexes to the TcZ complexes, to obtain a complete ranking of all six complexes. Comparison with the crystallographic data is done in the next section.

Comparison among TetR:TcN complexes We considered TetR:TcN complexes with a neutral His64 in two protonation states, termed HSD and HSE (proton on ND1 and NE2, respectively), and with two Asn82 orientations (Figure 2). Complexes with charged His64 were not considered, because double protonation of His64 was found not to increase significantly the stabilities of either apo-TetR or TetR:TcZ (see below). The three TetR:TcN complexes considered were compared by the approximate (PBLRA) method. For technical reasons, the TcN states were compared indirectly, by using TcZ states as intermediates. For example, N1 and N2--differing in the orientation of Asn82--were both compared directly to Z1 (see connections in Figure 2). N3 is the most stable, and N1 the least stable TcN state; indeed, flipping the side chain so that it donates a hydrogen bond to the Tc dimethylammonium lowers the free energy by about 2≠3 kcal mol¿1 (DGACHTUNGRE(N1!N2); Table 1). The span of values corresponds to a range of 1≠2 for the die-

This moderate statistical uncertainty is due partly to the long simulations and partly to the tight ACHTUNGREorganization and moderate fluctuations of the TetR binding pocket. Note also that the PBLRA method makes use of the ACHTUNGREinteraction energy between the ligand and its environment, which has intrinsically smaller fluctuations than the total energy (as used in, for example, the well known MM/PBSA method[29, 33]). Comparison among TetR:TcZ complexes We considered TetR:TcZ complexes with three His64 protonation states: HSD (state Z1), HSE (state Z2), and the doubly protonated form HSP (state Z3).

The Z1 state has the single both of which follow the horizontal legs of the thermodynamic His64 proton on the less favorable HSD side, losing the hydrocycle shown in Figure 4 A. The protonation state is reversibly gen bond to TcZ. This raises the free energy considerably, by 5≠ 8 kcal mol¿1 (Table 2). We also studied the His64 protonation state in the absence of Tc (Table 2). Results are very similar, with the doubly protonated state almost equistable with HSE, and with HSD 5≠ 10 kcal mol¿1 higher. Tc binding thus does not affect the protonation state: His64 is preorganized for Tc binding.
Table 2. Free-energy simulations comparing different protonation states of His64.

Comparison between TcN and TcZ in solution To compare the stabilities of TcN and TcZ complexes (below), we must first compare the two tautomers in solution. Tc has been modeled in solution by use of a quantum mechanical description of the solute and a continuum dielectric description of the solvent.[30] We considered two Tc forms: Tc¿:Mg2 + and N Tc¿:Mg2 + . Four water molecules that chelate the cation are Z treated as part of the solute; these and the Mg2 + cation are included in the quantum mechanical treatment. For each form, we considered several extended and twisted conformations, and the energies corresponding to the most stable structures are shown in Table 3. The extended, Tc¿:Mg2 + complex is seen Z to be the more stable in solution: by about 1.5 kcal mol¿1, which is comparable to the uncertainty of the computational method. The preference for a tautomer that is both extended and zwitterionic is consistent with the structures found in the Cambridge Crystallographic Databank (CCDB): all the zwitterionic Tc structures are extended, whereas all the neutral structures are twisted.[24] This free-energy difference arises from two competing effects: TcZ is solvated much more strongly than TcN (as would be expected from its greater charge separation), with a solvent contribution 9 kcal mol¿1 larger than for TcN (fourth column in Table 3); this is partly offset by a 6 kcal mol¿1 penalty in the solute intramolecular energy. The lowest extended TcN has a relative free energy of about 3 kcal mol¿1, 1.5 kcal mol¿1 higher than the twisted conformer.

changed by gradually changing the atomic charges on the His64 side chain. The upper leg makes the change in the protein; the lower leg corresponds to a side chain analogue (methylimidazole in solution) that serves as a reference molecule. Subtraction yields the double free-energy difference DDGACHTUNGRE(HSE!HSP). The proton binding constant of His64 is related to DDG by the relationship: pK a,prot º pK a,model ˛ 1 DDGHSE !

This number arises from two contributions: the increased stability

Protonation in Tetracycline:Tet Repressor Recognition We are now in a position to rank all six states considered (see Figure 3). Error bars in the Figure (∆ 1 kcal mol¿1) correspond to the average statistical uncertainty for all the PBLRA runs. The solution quantum calculations add an additional uncertainty for the positions of all the N states relative to all the Z states. This uncertainty is harder to quantify, but is unlikely to be more than 2≠3 kcal mol¿1, so that it should not affect the overall ranking of Z2 and Z3. Z2 and Z3 are the lowest states and almost equistable, with a very small preference for the doubly protonated His64 (Z3). The increased stabilities of these states are the result of three main factors: a strong preference for the TcZ tautomer in solution, improved interactions of Asn82 with the Tc dimethylammonium group (compare N2 to N3), and improved interactions of His64 with the Tc amide carbonyl and Tc-O2 (compare Z1 to Z2 and Z3). The dominant Tc state, the extended TcZ, is the same in the protein and in solution: the Tc ligand is preorganized for TetR binding.

Comparison between TetR:TcN and TetR:TcZ complexes To compare the TcN and TcZ complexes, we linked the N3 and Z2 states by both MDFE and PBLRA; results are summarized in Table 1. Both methods follow the horizontal legs of the thermodynamic cycle in Figure 4 B: the Tc¿ :Mg2 + moiety is alchemN ically transformed into Tc¿ :Mg2 + , both in solution and in comZ plexation with the protein. By comparing the two legs, we obtain a binding free-energy difference, DDGbindACHTUNGRE(TcN !TcZ). The overall difference in stability between the N3 and Z2 states can be written: DGN3 !

TcZ ﬁ 2ﬁ TetR:Tc:Mg2 + binding--crystallographic refinement The initially refined crystallographic model (model 1) was manually modified to create a second, alternative model (model 2). The amide side chains of Asn82, Gln116, the amide group of doxyTc, and the imidazole ring of His64 were all flipped by 1808. The use of the doxyTc complex instead of a Tc complex is not a concern, because the known atomic positions agree very closely for these two complexes. Asn5 and His100 were also flipped, as controls. Indeed, for these two side chains, the correct orientation is obvious from the hydrogen bonding patterns in the structure (e.g., His100 coordinates the Mg2 + cation). These two alternative models were refined to convergence, and the correct conformations of each group were then identified by comparison of the individual, isotropic, Debye≠ Waller factors of the corresponding amide and imidazole atoms; see Table 4. The Debye≠Waller factor measures the thermal disorder of a given atom; a large value indicates a mobile atom that is less effective at scattering X-rays. For a correctly oriented Asn or Gln side chain, the mobilities of the ND1 and OD2 atoms would be expected to be similar, due to their similar environments. Wrong conformations are therefore identified unambiguously by unusual discrepancies of the Debye≠Waller factors between alternative O/N- or C/N-positions. Consider, for example, the Asn5 side chain in model 2, in which the discrepancy is large. Evidently, the terminal group is

The rightmost quantity, DGsolACHTUNGRE(TcN !TcZ), corresponds to the stability difference in solution, which was estimated quantum mechanically (above) to be ¿3 kcal mol¿1 (we consider here the extended N and Z tautomers). MDFE gives DDGbindACHTUNGRE(TcN !TcZ) = ¿2.7 ∆ 0.3 kcal mol¿1, with a very good consistency between the two MDFE runs performed. The PBLRA results with protein dielectric values of one (¿5.0 kcal mol¿1) and two (¿2.5 kcal mol¿1) bracket the MDFE result and show that a protein dielectric of two is more realistic. A dielectric of two can be interpreted as an effect of electronic polarizability of the protein. Including the quantum mechanical data for Tc in solution, DGsolACHTUNGRE(TcN !TcZ) = ¿3.0 kcal mol¿1, we find that Z2 is 5.7 kcal mol¿1 lower in free energy than N3.

T. Simonson et al. incorrectly flipped by 1808, exchanging the O and N positions, and in the structure refinement there is too much scattering power in the oxygen position and too little in the nitrogen position. To compensate, the refinement gives final Debye≠Waller factors that are too high for the (incorrectly placed) oxygen and too low for the (incorrectly placed) nitrogen. The mismatch between the two Debye≠Waller factors (Table 4, model 2) identifies this Asn5 orientation as incorrect. In contrast, model 1 has a much closer match between the N and O Debye≠Waller factors, indicating that the Asn5 orientation is correct. Refinement statistics for other parameters such as coordinates of individual atoms are very similar in the two refined models (not shown). For all the groups considered-- Asn5, His64, Asn82, His100, Gln116, and the doxyTc amide-- there is a clear Debye≠Waller factor mismatch in model 2, so that the correct orientation can be clearly identified as that of model 1. In all cases, a reasonable hydrogen bonding network is maintained in model 1. Structure and dynamics of TetR and the TetR:Tc:Mg2 + ACHTUNGREcomplex The MD and X-ray structures are compared in Figure 5 A and Tables 5 and 6. All the MD models give low rms coordinate ACHTUNGREdeviations from experiment for atoms within the Tc binding pocket, between 0.7 and 1.1  (Table 5). Model Z2 gives the second lowest deviation (0.8 ), while Z3 gives the highest (1.1 ). The protein≠ligand interatomic distances (Table 6) are reproduced well both by Z2 and by Z3, with Z3 giving a slightly better agreement. Figure 5 A shows that the Z2 and Z3 structures superimpose almost perfectly with the X-ray structure, with the six groups considered in the X-ray refinement all having the correct orientation in both Z2 and Z3. In models Z1 and Z2, His64 is neutral, singly protonated either on ND1 (Z1) or on NE2 (Z2), while His64 in Z3 is doubly protonated. When a single proton is on ND1 (Z1) the interaction with Tc is lost; the side chain shifts, and two water molecules move from the bulk into the initial His64 position to replace its interactions with Tc. One interacts with Tc-O8 and the other with Tc-O2. This disagrees with the experimentally determined structures, in which the Tc:His64 interaction is maintained. In models Z2 and Z3, the positions of Asn82, Gln116, and Tc are practically the same, while the Tc:His64 interactions differ slightly. In model Z2, His64 interacts mainly with Tc-O2 (equilibrium distance of 2.9 ). In Z3, it shares its interaction between Tc-O2 and Tc-O8, in better agreement with the present X-ray structure, and with five out of six others listed in Table 6 (all but 1BJ0). In Z3, the other His64 proton (on ND1) interacts with the Ser85 carbonyl oxygen, behind the binding pocket. In all six MD models the Mg2 + ion coordinates three water molecules and interacts with His100. Two of these waters also interact with residue Glu147 from the other protomer (within the TetR dimer), while the third water interacts with Thr103. The same arrangement is found in the experimentally ascertained structure. Other than the waters coordinating Mg2 + , Tc interacts directly with just one other water molecule: through Tc-O1 and Tc-O6. This water is also seen in the X-ray structure,

structures.[34] His100 and Glu147 shift to coordinate Mg2 + when Tc binds, and Arg104 moves closer to the ligand and forms a salt bridge with Asp178 from the other protomer. Its side chain surface is two-thirds exposed without Tc and twothirds buried with Tc. The protonation state of His64 does not change upon Tc binding, from the PBLRA results above. From the simulations, Asn82 flips its terminal (CO)NH2 by 1808 to interact with His64 in the absence of Tc, but occupies approximately the same space. The His64 positions with and without Tc superimpose almost exactly. The electrostatic complementarity between the binding pocket and the Tc ligand is illustrated in Figure 6.

Free-energy components and Tc:TetR complementarity From the structural and thermodynamic data, we can quantify the contributions of several individual groups to Tc binding, in the spirit of a hydrogen bond inventory model or an alanine-

scanning experiment. In particular, the Poisson model has a useful property: the TetR:Tc binding free energy can be broken down into several distinct contributions,[29, 35] including contributions from individual amino acids in the Tc binding pocket. We refer to them as free-energy components. We emphasize that the Poisson components, unlike free components calculated with MDFE, do not depend on a "pathway" connecting the bound and the unbound states, but only on the endpoints of the binding reaction.[29, 35] The components are estimated from the electrostatic interactions between a particular amino acid and the Tc ligand (with its co-bound Mg2 + ). The estimation is made by use of the native TetR:Tc structure. With the Poisson continuum model, structural changes associated with deletion of an amino acid side chain are modeled implicitly, through the solute dielectric constant (2 = 4; see Experimental Section). This should be reasonably accurate only for mutations that do not produce large structural changes. Figure 7 shows the contributions of individual amino acids to the Poisson binding free energy of Tc in the Z3 state. In a few cases, experimentally measured binding free energies for TetR point mutants are

T. Simonson et al. given, where a side chain has been replaced by alanine.[36] The free-energy change upon alanine replacement can be interpreted as an experimental measure of the original side chain's contribution to the Tc binding free energy, so it is of interest to compare the Poisson free-energy components to these values. The largest Poisson contributions come from Glu147 and His100, which coordinate the Mg2 + ion. We saw that these groups undergo a large conformational change when Tc binds (Figure 5 B). In fact, when these amino acids are mutated, Tc binds without any co-bound Mg2 + ,[36] so it is not surprising that the Poisson components for these amino acids are very different from the experimentally determined values (Figure 7). In contrast, the Poisson values for Asn82 (¿4.7 kcal mol¿1) and Thr103 (¿3.4 kcal mol¿1) match the experimental results perfectly, which gives confidence that the Poisson model yields good approximate measures of the (electrostatic) contributions of most individual amino acids to binding. Other groups representing significant components are His64 (¿4.5 kcal mol¿1) and Gln116 (¿3.6 kcal mol¿1). Arg104 also represents a sizeable positive component (2.3 kcal mol¿1 opposing binding), but this ACHTUNGREestimate is not very reliable because Arg104, like Glu147 and His100, undergoes a large conformational change upon Tc binding. Insights into the roles of His64 and Asn82 can also be obtained from the free-energy differences between the states N3, Z1, Z2, and Z3. Consider first His64. States Z2 and Z3 are almost equistable; this indicates that His64 does not stabilize Tc through its positive charge, but rather through its hydrogen bonds to Tc-O2 and Tc-O8. These provide about ¿5 kcal mol¿1 (the free-energy difference between Z2 and Z1 and between Z3 and Z1). This is close to the His64 free-energy component of ¿4.5 kcal mol¿1 obtained from the Poisson analysis above. A similar estimate is obtained by comparison of states N2 and N3 (Figure 2). Consider next Asn82. States N3 and Z2 differ by ¿2.7 kcal mol¿1 (MDFE result, Table 1). This is over half the Asn82 Poisson free-energy component (¿4.7 kcal mol¿1), indicating that when Tc is switched to its Z state, strengthened ACHTUNGREinteractions with Asn82 account for most of the affinity gain. This is expected from the hydrogen bonds seen in the X-ray structure, but the simulation data give a more quantitative picture. We note that Asn82 is flipped in the apoprotein, suggesting that its interaction with His64 is slightly repulsive in the Z2 and Z3 states. His64's interaction with the Tc ligand. The range of free energies spanned by the six states shown in Figure 3 illustrates the difficulty. By performing extensive simulations and X-ray ACHTUNGREstructure refinements, a comparison between experiment and theory could be made for the orientations of the six active-site groups. The excellent agreement observed gives confidence that other properties are correctly predicted by the simulations. In particular, we find that the zwitterionic Tc tautomer is strongly preferred, and that the nearby His64 occupies a mixture of singly and doubly protonated states. Our prediction of the His64 protonation state could be tested by pKa measurements in the presence and absence of Tc. Our prediction of a zwitterionic Tc is consistent with the tetracycline structures in the Cambridge Crystallographic Databank. Indeed, Tc in TetR complexes always has an extended conformation, and all the extended Tcs in the CCDB are zwitterionic, whereas all the neutral Tcs in the CCDB have twisted conformations. The question arises of whether the Debye≠Waller analysis used here can be generally applied to orient groups in protein structure refinements, and whether complementary simulations are generally useful. We cannot make a definite statement, but the agreement found between the X-ray refinement and simulations is encouraging and does suggest that, for crystallographic datasets with a comparable resolution, a careful Debye≠Waller analysis should at least be explored. Overall, TetR:Tc binding is a complex process, involving competition between several effects, and with electrostatics playing an important role. These effects include superior solvation of TcZ relative to TcN, a strengthened interaction with Asn82 for the Z tautomer, and the balance of interactions of His64 with Tc, Asn82, and solvent. Interestingly, while His64 interactions contribute several kcal mol¿1 to Tc binding, its extra positive charge in the Z3 state has almost no effect. Overall, the TetR binding pocket combines electrostatic preorganization in the region of the Tc amide and ammonium groups with an induced fit in the region that coordinates the Mg2 + ion. Ligand binding and acid/base equilibria are important for most aspects of protein function, so the simulation techniques used here are of general interest. Free-energy simulations have been extensively applied to these problems in the past, but, after an initial burst of popularity in the early 1990s,[38] technical and fundamental difficulties were brought to light that led to a drop in their use. In recent years, substantial progress has been made,[26≠28] as illustrated by the good agreement with ACHTUNGREexperiment seen here. Two substantially different free-energy methods have been compared with each other and with experimental data, thus providing support both for the methodology and for the newly developed tetracycline forcefield.[24] More recently, we have also obtained very good agreement with experimental results[39] for binding affinities of a series of ten tetracycline analogues for TetR (A.A. and T.S., unpublished results). We expect that with the current level of simulation maturity and available computer power, joint experimental and theoretical studies will increasingly help to reveal the complexity of protein≠ligand recognition.

Conclusions
A great deal is known about Tc:TetR binding from X-ray crystallography and biochemistry. It is noteworthy that for the six groups whose orientations have been determined here by experimental Debye≠Waller factor analysis, the original crystallographic model (model 1) turned out to be correct. Nevertheless, neither these orientations nor details of the bindingpocket protonation state could be inferred with complete confidence before this work. A program used to position hydrogens automatically, WHATCHECK,[37] protonated His64 incorrectly, probably because it is not able to take into account

Protonation in Tetracycline:Tet Repressor Recognition

Experimental Section
Tc in solution--computed structures and free energies Structures: To generate models of Tc in solution and in complexation with the protein, we proceeded as described previously.[24] Briefly, we retrieved 20 crystal structures of tetracyclines from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Bank (CCDB).[40] The structures can be grouped into two families, corresponding to "extended" and "twisted" conformations. Starting from selected CCDB structures, we performed molecular dynamics simulated annealing in vacuum with use of the MM3 forcefield.[41] and the Tinker program,[42] in order to generate a wide variety of Tc conformations. After clustering by use of the ART-2 algorithm[43] and the CHARMM program, a few representative structures were optimized quantum mechanically at the B3LYP/6≠31G(d) level.[44≠46] With this procedure, we generated models for both Tc¿ and Tc¿ bound to a Mg2 + ion N Z (Figure 1). Solution free energies--ab initio calculations: We used quantum mechanical density functional methods to compute the free-energy difference between Tc¿ :Mg2 + and Tc¿ :Mg2 + in solution. We used N Z the B3LYP hybrid functional[44, 45] and the 6≠31G* basis set.[46] Geometries were fully optimized by use of the Gaussian03 program.[47] Single-point energy calculations on the optimized structures were performed with use of a dielectric continuum representation of aqueous solvent, with the aid of the polarizable continuum model (PCM).[30] TetR:Tc binding--computed structures and free energies Molecular dynamics simulations: The crystal structure of the class D Tet Repressor dimer (TetR) was taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), entries 2TRT (with bound Tc) and 1A6I (without bound Tc).[8, 34] The simulations included protein residues within a 24  sphere, centered on the Tc binding site. In addition to crystal waters, a 24  sphere of water was overlaid and waters that overlapped protein, crystal waters, Tc (when present), or Mg2 + were removed. Protein atoms between 20  and 24  from the sphere's center were harmonically restrained to their experimentally determined positions. Simulations were performed with the aid of the SSBP solvent model,[48, 49] which treats the region outside the 24  sphere as a uniform dielectric continuum, with a dielectric constant of 80. This is reasonable, since most of the outer region is water. Newtonian dynamics were used for the innermost region, within 20  of the sphere's center; Langevin dynamics were used for the outer part of the sphere, with a 292 K bath. The CHARMM22 forcefield was used for the protein[50] and the TIP3P model for water.[51] Tetracycline was described with the forcefield developed previously.[24] Electrostatic interactions were computed without any cutoff, with use of a multipole approximation for distant groups.[52] Calculations were done with the CHARMM program.[53] Alchemical MD free-energy simulations (MDFE): To compare Tc¿ and N Tc¿ binding, we used the thermodynamic cycle shown in Figure 4. Z The MDFE method follows the horizontal legs of the cycle. Tc¿ is N reversibly transformed into Tc¿ during a series of MD simulations. Z 2+ For the lower leg, we simulated Tc:Mg in the center of a 24  radius water sphere, surrounded by a dielectric continuum representing bulk solvent.[48] For the upper leg, we simulated a portion of the Tc:Mg2 + :TetR complex, solvated by the same 24  water sphere and embedded in the same dielectric continuum. Portions of TetR outside the 24  sphere would be expected to contribute very little to the binding free-energy difference.[49] In each simulation system, the energy function can be expressed as a linear combination of Tc¿ :Mg2 + and Tc¿ :Mg2 + terms [Eq. (3)]: N Z

Here the brackets indicate an average over an MD trajectory with the energy function U(l).[26, 54] We gradually mutated TcN into TcZ by changing l from one to zero. In practice, the transformation between Tc¿ :Mg2 + and Tc¿ :Mg2 + takes the form of a rearrangement N Z of atomic charges on a few Tc atoms, because the displaced hydrogen does not enter into van der Waals interactions in this forcefield. The successive values of l were: 0.999, 0.99, 0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. The free-energy derivatives were computed at each l value from a 100 ps MD simulation; the last 80 ps were used for averaging. A complete mutation run thus corresponded to 1.2 ns. One run was performed in each direction (TcN to TcZ and the reverse). The free-energy change was computed by numerical integration of the derivatives. We also used the MDFE method to estimate the pKa values of His64 of TetR, which is part of the Tc binding site. In this case, the solution leg transforms methylimidazole into its doubly protonated state. Both the protein and the solution transformations were modeled as rearrangements of atomic charges on the imidazole group; see refs. [31, 55] for details. A single run was performed for each leg, lasting for 4.8 ns (protein leg) or 2.4 ns (solution leg). Poisson≠Boltzmann Linear Response Approximation (PBLRA): A recently developed method that combines MD simulations with continuum electrostatics is the Poisson≠Boltzmann Linear Response Approximation (PBLRA) method.[31, 56, 57] This method is well suited to treatment of rearrangements of atomic charges, as in the TcN to TcZ transformation or His64 protonation. The free-energy change (DGpro¿DGsol in Figure 4) is approximated by the continuum electrostatic free energy, averaged over the equilibrium states before and after the rearrangement. We applied the method with MD structures of the Tc¿ :Mg2 + and Tc¿ :Mg2 + states (see above), and it N Z was also used to compare protonation states of His64 in the Tc binding pocket. The equilibrium states were simulated for 3 ns each. Calculations are performed here at zero ionic strength, so that we solve the Poisson, and not the Poisson≠Boltzmann, equation. Nevertheless, we refer to the method as PBLRA. For similar systems, we have found that PBLRA results are weakly sensitive to the ionic strength.[58] The Poisson equation was solved by use of a finite difference method implemented in the Charmm program, with a cubic grid of length 144 , with 0.4  between grid planes. 250 structures were used for each state. The solute dielectric constant was set to 1 or 2, and the solvent dielectric was set to 80, the experimentally determined value for bulk water. Poisson calculations and free-energy component analysis: The Poisson model can also be used to compute the electrostatic contribution to the Tc binding free energy.[29, 33, 35] We simply compute the electrostatic free energy of the TetR complex and the separate partners and take the difference. This Poisson binding free energy then has a useful property: it can be broken down into several distinct contributions,[29, 35] including contributions from individual amino acids in the Tc binding pocket. We refer to these as freeenergy components. A higher solute dielectric, relative to the PBLRA situation, might be appropriate for this analysis. Indeed, with PBLRA we averaged over structures corresponding to the system before and after a charge modification (e.g., His protona-

tion). Dielectric relaxation of the protein is explicitly modeled by the structural differences between the two states. Here, in contrast, dielectric relaxation when the TetR:Tc complex is formed is implicitly modeled by the solute dielectric constant. Below, we have chosen the solute dielectric constant so that the binding freeenergy difference between TcN and TcZ approximately reproduces that obtained by MDFE (with use of N3 and Z2). This gives a solute dielectric of four, similarly to previous work on similar problems.[33, 35] Crystallization, X-ray diffraction, and structure refinement: TetR of class D--TetR(D)--was co-crystallized with doxycycline and Mg2 + by previously described methods for other tetracycline complexes of TetR.[8, 59, 60] The doxycycline:Mg2 + complex of TetR(D) crystallized in space group I4122, isomorphous with other TetR(D) complexes with tetracycline:Mg2 + . X-ray diffraction data were collected at the synchrotron beam line X13 of the EMBL outstation (DESY, Hamburg). Flash-frozen crystals were measured in a gaseous N2 stream at 100 K. Data were reduced by use of the HKL package[61] and further processed with the aid of programs of the CCP4 suite.[62] Initial phasing and model building were based on the TetR(D) complex with 7-chlorotetracycline:Mg2 + (PDB ID: 2TCT). Refinement was performed with the program REFMAC.[63] Details and statistics for data collection and structure refinement are given in Table 7. tween the Debye≠Waller factors of atoms separated by one or two covalent bonds were thus penalized, as is physically reasonable. The correct conformations of each group were then identified by comparison of the individual, isotropic, Debye≠Waller factors of the corresponding amide and imidazole atoms in models 1 and 2. The coordinates of the best model (with the correct orientations of each individual group) have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank.
