The high-resolution solution structure of a monomeric circular permuted (cp) variant of the potent HIV-inactivating protein cyanovirin-N (CV-N) was determined by NMR. Comparison with the wild-type (wt) structure revealed that the observed loss in stability of cpCV-N compared to the wt protein is due to less favorable packing of several residues at the pseudo twofold axis that are responsible for holding the two halves of the molecule together. In particular, the N and C-terminal amino acid residues exhibit conformational flexibility, resulting in fewer and less favorable contacts between them. The important hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding network between residues W49, D89, H90, Y100 and E101 that was observed in wt CV-N is no longer present. For instance, Y100 and E101 are flexible and the tryptophan side-chain is in a different conformation compared to the wt protein. The stability loss amounts to , 2 kcal/mol and the mobility of the protein is evident by fast amide proton exchange throughout the chain. Mutation of the single proline residue to glycine (P52G) did not substantially affect the stability of the protein, in contrast to the finding for wtCV-N. The binding of high-mannose type oligosaccharides to cpCV-N was also investigated. Similar to wtCV-N, two carbohydrate-binding sites were identified on the protein and the Man a1 ! 2Man linked moieties on the sugar were delineated as binding epitopes. Unlike in wtCV-N, the binding sites on cpCV-N are structurally similar and exhibit comparable binding affinities for the respective sugars. On the basis of the studies presented here and previous results on highmannose binding to wtCV-N, we discuss a model for the interaction between gp120 and CV-N.

Introduction
Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is a 11 kDa virucidal protein that holds promise in the development of novel treatment strategies for AIDS1 and other viral diseases.2 In the case of HIV, CV-N exerts its antiviral activity in part by binding to the highmannose oligosaccharides, Man-8 and Man-9, on the viral surface envelope glycoprotein gp120.3 ­ 5

CV-N inhibits crucial events in the early stages of viral entry and constitutes a valuable reagent for investigating virion-cell fusion.1,2,6 ­ 10 Detailed studies of the structural determinants pertinent to this activity, combined with mutagenesis, are crucial for a thorough understanding of CV-N's mode of action and any possible future clinical use. The three-dimensional structure of wild-type (wt)CV-N was previously determined by NMR and X-ray crystallography.11 ­ 16 These structures provide the basis for a rational approach for re-design and functional analyses. Here, we investigated a circular permuted version of CV-N

The notation of the NMR structures is as follows: kSAl are the final 25 simulated annealing structures; SA is the mean structure obtained by averaging the coordinates of the individual kSAl structures best-fitted to each other (residues 4­99); SAr is the restrained regularized mean structure obtained by restrained regularization of the mean structure SA.

(cpCV-N). Circular permutation affords distinct information on structure­ function relationships that cannot be achieved through classical singlesite or deletion mutagenesis. Previously, we presented the design and an initial characterization of cpCV-N and demonstrated that this variant adopted the wtCV-N fold, although it was less stable and exhibited lower anti-HIV activity.17,18 Now, we report the high-resolution NMR structure of cpCV-N. The present work elucidates the atomic details responsible for the stability loss of the protein and altered oligosaccharide interaction compared to wtCV-N. Since binding to highmannose oligosaccharides on gp120 is the pivotal event leading to antiviral activity, the detailed comparison between the structures of cpCV-N and the

wt protein with their associated sugar-binding properties opens opportunities for structurally guided approaches to the re-design of this potently active type of anti-HIV virucide.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination cpCV-N contains 102 amino acid residues and was numbered G(2 1)L(1)...E(101) for direct comparison with the numbering previously used for the wt protein (L(1)...E(101)). An extensive set of multidimensional, heteronuclear NMR experiments was collected on uniformly 15N- and

0% of residues are in most favored, additional allowed, generously allowed and disallowed regions, respectively. Two van der Waals clashes were observed for residues L13 and S62. This initial ensemble of structures was further refined against residual dipolar couplings (80) and chemical shifts (291) in Cartesian space using the program CNS.20 Marked improvements in the structural quality were observed as assessed by PROCHECK,21 and no van der Waals clashes remained (Table 1). Overall, excellent agreement with the experimental data was achieved and good covalent geometry was maintained throughout. A final ensemble of 25 conformers was selected and a model representing the minimized mean structure of this ensemble was chosen for illustration and discussion purposes (Figure 1). Description of the structure: comparison with monomeric wtCV-N The overall structure of cpCV-N is shown in Figure 1. Structural parts involved in the sequence swap (Figure 1(A)) are colored blue and red, whereas those residues remaining at their wt sequence positions are colored yellow. The corresponding amino acid sequences are provided at the bottom of Figure 1(A). Like wtCV-N, cpCV-N exhibits a pseudo twofold symmetric structure with an N-terminal domain (domain Acp; blue) and a C-terminal domain (domain Bcp; red). Its architecture consists of two anti-parallel triplestranded b-sheets (sheet 1 comprises residues 7 ­14 (b1), 17 ­25 (b2) and 29­ 37 (b3); sheet 2 comprises residues 58­ 65 (b6), 67 ­75 (b7) and 79 ­87 (b8)), two b-hairpins (comprising residues 41 ­44 (b4) and 47 ­51 (b5 and 91­ 94 (b9) and 97 ­99 (b10)), two 310 helical turns (residues 4 ­ 6 (a1) and

54 ­57 (a2)) and a linker sequence (residues 52 ­ 53) between strand b5 and a2. The six b-turns connecting the strands are formed by residues 15 ­16, 26 ­28, 45 ­46, 66, 76 ­ 78 and 95 ­ 96. Residues that connect the pseudo symmetric domains (38 ­40 between b3 and b4 and 88 ­90 between b8 and b9) are irregular, although they exhibit some helical character. The two b-sheets of cpCV-N contain b-bulges at residues 10­ 11 and 61 ­62, corresponding to those in wtCV-N involving residues 10 ­11 and 60­ 61. A stereo view of the superposition of the final ensemble of 25 calculated conformers is displayed in Figure 1(B). Most backbone and side-chain atoms are well defined, although the N- and Ctermini (residues G-1, L1, G2, K3, Y100 and E101) exhibit noticeable disorder for both the backbone and side-chains, whereas other ill-defined residues show predominately multiple side-chain conformations. Poorly defined side-chains are primarily located on the surface of the molecule, thus their disorder is most likely reflecting the lack of experimental restraints, although real conformational flexibility cannot be excluded. That indeed motion could contribute to the disorder at the termini is evidenced by the absence of the amide resonances in the 1H ­ 15N HSQC, although small long-range side-chain ­ side-chain NOEs are observed for all residues apart from G-1 and E101. The motional properties of cpCV-N are represented in Figure 1(C) on a tubular representation of the backbone where the width of the tube is proportional to the r.m.s. spread of the ensemble of structures. Residues exhibiting motions on the ns­ ps timescale are colored in light-blue and residues with shorter than average T2-values, possibly reflecting local motions on the ms­ ms timescale, are highlighted in red. The latter residues are located in the connections between the N- and C-terminal domains

and in particular in the vicinity of the single proline (P52) in the transposed loop (yellow in Figure 1(C)). As pointed out above and previously,17,18 the overall architecture of cpCV-N and wtCV-N is very similar, with both molecules having an ellipsoidal shape. Figure 2 presents stereoview superpositions of the subdomains for direct structural comparison between these two proteins. Domains Acp and Bcp, comprising residues (2 1) ­39/90 ­101 and 40 ­ 89 were superimposed onto domains Bwt (39 ­ 89) and Awt (1 ­ 38/90 ­101), respectively (Figure 2(A) and (B)). Backbone r.m.s. differences of 0.66 and 0.72 are observed for Acp/Bwt and Bcp/ Awt, respectively. Likewise, superpositions of the sequence repeats of cpCV-N and wt-CV-N, (4 ­ 49)cp/(54 ­ 99)wt and (55 ­ 99)cp/(4­ 48)wt yield ° ° atomic r.m.s. differences of 0.78 A and 0.81 A, respectively. Stereoviews of these superpositions

are provided in Figure 2(C) and (D). A more detailed view of a best-fit superposition of the entire structures, including side-chains, is displayed in Figure 3(A). Residues 4­ 99 (cpCV-N, green) and 1­ 101 (wtCV-N, orange) are shown. Major differences were observed for the packing of hydrophobic residues at the pseudo twofold axis around the W50 side-chain. Those residues are displayed in Figure 3 with close up views of the areas in cpCV-N and wtCV-N shown in Figure 3(B) and (C), respectively. Several of these residues are clearly different in chemical character, in addition to the differences in conformational flexibility involving this region and the N and C termini. Features associated with these differences are most likely responsible for the disparities observed between cpCV-N and wtCV-N, particularly in terms of protein stability, as discussed below.

cpCV-N Structure, Stability and Sugar-binding

Stability: importance of hydrophobic core packing and the single proline residue We previously reported that our cp variant of CV-N is significantly less stable than the wt protein.18 This instability is reflected in the H/D exchange behavior. All amide protons in cpCV-N exchange within five hours at 20 8C, in contrast to wtCV-N, for which under identical conditions , 30 groups did not exhibit any appreciable exchange within 72 hours. In fact, this sample of wt protein was stored in 2H2O for one year at , 5 ­10 8C, followed by a period of 48 hours at 42 8C, after which 13 amide protons resonances were still observed. The corresponding amino acid residues were distributed over both domains. In domain Awt they are located in b-sheet 1 (L18/T19/S20/I34/L36) and the second b-hairpin (I91/A92/K99) and in domain Bwt in b-sheet 2 (L69/A70/A71) and first b-hairpin (E41/K48). It appears that structural fluctuations may be slightly more prominent in domain Bwt. In the wt structure we previously identified an interesting constellation of hydrophobic and charged residues at the pseudo twofold axis that hold the two domains together. In particular, W49, D89, H90, Y100 and E101 in wtCV-N are involved in hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding and the loss of this interaction network may be responsible for the decreased stability of cpCV-N (cf. Figure 3(B) and (C)). Indeed, the W49 side-chain is in a different conformation, and the polar interaction between the indol N1 1H and the side-chain carboxylate of D89 is absent, since the equivalent residue is a serine in cpCV-N. This results in a more solvent exposed Trp side-chain in the cpCV-N structure. In addition, the less tight packing of the N- and C-terminal residues could also contribute to the destabilization of the mutant. In wtCV-N these residues help pack the b-hairpin onto the b-sheet, whereas in cpCV-N these interactions are absent. The two aromatic side-chains of W50 and Y100 are part of the hydrophobic core at the pseudo C2-axis in both molecules. Although they are in close proximity in either case, their mutual disposition is clearly altered in the two structures. Not a single NOE was observed between the aromatic ring protons of W50 and Y100 in cpCV-N, whereas a substantial number were present in wtCV-N. Most importantly, the residues of the hinge region, W50/Q51/P52/S53/N54, were in a different structural environment. In light of our previous results with respect to the important role of P51 in wtCV-N,14 we investigated the role of P52 in the cp molecule. In wtCV-N, substitution of P51 by glycine resulted in a remarkable increase in thermodynamic stability of the protein by , 5.7 kcal/mol. For cpCV-N, the P52G mutant was not substantially more stable and the mid-points of the thermal melting curves for the cpCV-N and P52GcpCV-N proteins are nearly identical, (48:5 ^ 0:5 8C and 50:2 ^ 0:5 8C, respectively). This result for cpCV-N is not surprising, since other

factors destabilize the protein significantly, rendering the proline to glycine substitution of little advantage. In addition, the salt bridge in wtCV-N between N53 (Hd) and E56 (O1) is not present in cpCV-N, given that a different amino acid occupies the position of E56. Also, the contact between domains Awt and Bwt involving a H-bond between N37 (Hd) and N53 (Od) is not observed in cpCV-N. These contacts are important for the stability of wtCV-N. It should be noted that the proline to glycine mutation in wtCV-N was coupled to a change in monomer/dimer partitioning during refolding of the protein, favoring the monomeric form.14 Similar results were observed for the mutant P52GcpCV-N. Binding to high-mannose oligossacharides: structural basis for carbohydrate recognition on gp120 A substantial body of data suggests that N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides on gp120, Man-8 and Man-9, are the molecular target for wtCV-N.3 ­ 5 We previously demonstrated that , tenfold lower binding to gp120 was observed for cpCV-N.18 We therefore characterized the interaction of cpCV-N with several synthetic carbohydrate substructures of Man-8 and Man-9 in detail by NMR mapping. In particular, the binding of a nonamannoside (NM), hexamannoside (HM) and linear trimannoside (LTM) was investigated. Nonamannoside binding Addition of one equivalent of synthetic NM to cpCV-N resulted in backbone amide resonance changes in both domains, Acp and Bcp, simultaneously. Both, slow exchange (i.e. the appearance of new, bound resonances) and intermediate exchange behavior (i.e. broadening or disappearing of peaks) was observed. Further addition of sugar resulted in more changes and a superposition of free and NM-bound cpCV-N at saturation (, 14 equivalents of NM; red contours) is displayed in Figure 4(A). A large number of resonances are perturbed upon interaction with NM. In particular, those in domain Acp (black labeling) are: F4, I5, E6, T7, R9, C23, K24, T25, R26, A27, Q28, Q29, F30, K49, L87, N88, S89, E92, N93, V94, D95, G96, S97, K99 and residues in domain Bcp (green labeling) are: H40, I41, N43, I44, D45, G46, T47, L48, Q51, S53, N54, F55, S56, Q57, T58, C59, Y60, E74, R75 T76, N77, G78, Y80. Mapping of those residues with perturbed resonances onto the structure of cpCV-N is displayed for the entire molecule in Figure 4(B) and in space filling-mode for each domain in Figure 5(A)/(B). Similar to results for wtCV-N, two distinct locations on the cpCV-N structure were identified. However, in contrast to the situation in wtCV-N, for which different apparent affinities towards the two sites were noted5, similar affinities were observed for cpCV-N. Closer examination of the 1H ­ 15N HSQC

cpCV-N Structure, Stability and Sugar-binding

spectrum revealed that for a variety of resonances, multiple cross-peaks were present at saturation at both binding sites (circled in Figure 4(A)). The most likely explanation for this observation relates to the multivalent interactions of the D1 and D3 arms of NM with cpCV-N. In particular, each binding site on the protein can potentially interact with either the D1 or D3 arm of NM. Since slightly different chemical structures of the terminal disaccharide units are involved, i.e. a 1 ! 2 or a 1 ! 6 linkage to the core-mannose, slightly different "bound" chemical shifts would ensue. If the binding affinities between either site on cpCV-N and both the D1 and D3 arms of NM were comparable, at saturation, at least four different complexes could be formed, if one protein binds to both, the D1 and D3, arms of the sugar. In order to determine whether in the final complex one protein is bound to one sugar, we estimated the size of the cpCV-N/NM complex by relaxation measurements. Heteronuclear T2 values for the amide protons and amide nitrogen atoms yielded average values of , 21 ms and , 58 ms, respectively. These values were similar to those measured for a domain-swapped dimer of wtCV-N14 and the wtCV-N/NM complex,5, suggesting that the cpCV-N complex comprises a species of , 22 kDa size. This demonstrates that at least two protein molecules are bound by the oligosaccharide and that cpCV-N can bind NM at either binding site. Having established that two protein molecules were present in the complex, it remained to be elucidated, whether any preference with respect to the D1 or D3 arm of NM for either of the two sites on cpCV-N existed. If indiscriminate binding would occur, four final complexes would ensue, namely {D1-siteA; D3-siteA}, {D1-siteB; D3-siteB}, {D1siteA; D3-siteB}, {D3-siteA; D1-siteB}(cf. also Figure 6). Inspection of the 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectrum presented in Figure 4 revealed that for a large number of amide groups, several resonances are indeed observed at saturation. At least two, and for some amides, up to four (S56, F4) peaks are apparent, clearly demonstrating that several different species were present. Residues in domain Acp (siteA) exhibit primarily two sets of resonances, most clearly seen for T25, R26, A27, and these amino acid residues are located at the outmost tip of the sheet in domain Acp. The equivalent residues in domain Bcp are T76, N77, G78 and it appears that only one new set of signals is observed. Given the presence of multiple resonances there is no doubt that several species are present. The fact that some residues lack multiple peaks cannot be taken as evidence for a single species, since degeneracy of resonances for very similar chemical environments is common. Hexamannoside binding On the basis of the previous results on sugarbinding to wtCV-N5 we investigated the interaction of cpCV-N with several substructures of the NM.

NM contains three consecutive a1 ! 2-linked mannoses (D1 arm) and the two consecutive a1 ! 2-linked mannoses (D3 arm). Hexamannose (HM, highlighted in red in Figure 4(C)) is a substructure that is branched to a similar extent as NM, but contains only one terminal a1 ! 2-linked dimannose unit. Similar to our findings with NM, resonances perturbed in the 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectrum of cpCV-N upon HM binding (data not shown) were very similar to those affected by NM binding, indicating that the same regions of the protein were involved. In contrast to the NM case, relaxation measurements revealed that the cpCVN/HM complex is a species of , 11 kDa size. This shows that HM interacts with either Acp and Bcp and that most likely one a1 ! 2-linked dimannose unit constitutes the effective binding epitope of the sugar. In addition, no multiple peaks were observed, supporting the interpretation that HM interacts only with the D1 arm with either site on cpCV-N. This finding is different from that observed for HM binding to wtCV-N. In the latter case, preferential binding of HM is observed to the site in domain Bwt and even for very high concentration of HM (19-fold excess) no indication of interaction with the site on Awt was observed.5 Therefore, binding of the D1 arm of HM to either of the two sites on wtCV-N entails a clear difference in affinities, whereas comparable affinities (with a Kd in the range of 5 ­50 mM) for the two sites on cpCV-N exist. Trimannoside binding A linear trimannoside unit (LTM) constitutes the D1 arm of NM (boxed in Figure 4(C)), and binding of this sugar was also investigated. Again, the chemical shift changes for the protein were essentially identical with those observed with NM and HM with a complex size of , 11 kDa and similar binding affinity to that of HM. This data confirmed that the structure required on the sugar responsible for interaction with either site on cpCV-N contains a1 ! 2-linked dimannoses. Comparison of the binding sites on cpCV-N with those on wtCV-N The results of all three sugar titrations demonstrate that cpCV-N contains two binding sites that are topologically similar, chemically different and exhibit comparable binding affinities. A structural comparison between these sites and the related sites on wtCV-N is provided in Figure 5. Both sites on cpCV-N, in domain Acp (Figure 5(A)) and domain Bcp (Figure 5(B)) contain pockets lined by polar residues, E6, T7, T25, R26, Q28, N88, N93 and D95 (Acp) or N43, D45, Q51, S53, N54, Q57, T58, E74, R75 and T76 (Bcp). Both sites are open at one of the edges, i.e. they do not exhibit clear external walls. This is in contrast to one of the sites on wtCV-N in domain Bwt (Figure 5(C)) that exhibits a deep pocket. This site was structurally

Molecular surface representations of the binding pockets in domains Acp (A) and Bcp (B), with residues exhibiting small and large changes in their amide resonance positions upon sugar binding colored yellow and red, respectively. Those not affected by sugar binding are shown in blue. The equivalent binding sites on monomeric wtCV-N (Bwt, Awt) are shown in (C) and (D). The colorcoding is the same as in (A) and (B) on the basis of chemical shift mapping data.5 Residues involved in a1 ! 2 dimannose contacts in a solution complex (Bwt)13 and in the X-ray structure of dimeric wtCV-N (Awt) with Man-916 are labeled in (C) and (D), with their counterparts in cpCV-N labeled in (A) and (B). Molecular structures were generated with the program GRASP30 and the coordinates of cpCV-N and wtCV-N were those of the minimized mean structure determined here and those of 2EZN.

delineated in a complex between wtCV-N and a a1 ! 2 dimannose.13 The site in domain Awt (Figure 5(D)), on the other hand, is even more shallow than either site on cpCV-N. In addition to the differences in shape, the chemical identities of key polar residues are different in cpCV-N and wtCV-N. Although crucial polar residues such as E41, E56, T57, K74, R76 and Q78 present in the primary site on domain Bwt are mostly present in domain Acp (E92, E6, T7, K24, R26 and Q28), other key residues on domain Bwt such as Q50, S52 and N53 are unfavorably replaced in domain Acp (Y100, G2 and K3) by residues of reduced polarity. In wtCV-N the S52 hydroxyl is postulated to donate a direct H-bond to a mannose hydroxyl, whereas Q50 and N53 may be involved in H-bonding to neighboring amino acid residues critical for sugar binding13 and these interactions are no longer possible in cpCV-N. In addition, the flexible N- and C- termini render this binding site somewhat less defined and contribute to its lower affinity. Indeed, in the X-ray structure of the dimeric domain-swapped wtCV-N in complex with high-mannose sugars, pivotal H-bonds between G2, K3 and E101 and the sugar are observed.16 In the case of the other site (on Bcp), the same three polar residues (Q51, S53 and N54)

are now part of the site, thereby most likely increasing the affinity for the carbohydrate and S53 could now partake in direct H-bonding to the mannose. Therefore, the net effect of the sequence and structure alteration in cpCV-N versus wtCV-N is a decrease in the affinity for carbohydrate of the site on domain Acp compared to Bwt and an increase in the site on domain Bcp compared to that on Awt, rendering both sites on cpCV-N of comparable affinity for the sugar. In terms of gp120 binding by CV-N, two models have been proposed, suggesting either binding to the high-mannose sugars on the envelope glycoprotein via one site on CV-N or both sites simultaneously (Figure 6), although mutants in which critical residues in the site on domain Awt were altered, were still capable of inhibiting fusion.22 We previously demonstrated that cpCV-N exhibited approximately tenfold lower binding to gp120 than wtCV-N. This may well reflect the lower affinity for the critical sugar determinants of site Acp compared to Bwt. cpCV-N contains two sites of approximately equal affinity and therefore, they are equally available for binding to carbohydrates on the surface of gp120, at least via one site at a time. Whether both sites on cpCV-N or wtCV-N bind simultaneously to the high mannoses

The trimeric glycoprotein is colored green and the mannopyranose and GlcNAc rings of Man-9 are represented as yellow triangles and white squares, respectively.

of viral-cell fusion; (2) CV-N binding to gp120 attached oligosaccharides locks this glycoprotein into a particular state and renders it unable to undergo the conformational changes necessary for interaction with the co-receptors. Due to the potential of CV-N for clinical application, it is important to further pursue the exact mechanism of action. In that respect it is interesting to note that the broadly neutralizing human anti-HIV-1 antibody 2G12 also recognizes the Mana1 ! 2Man moiety of high-mannose oligosaccharides on gp 120, the removal of which greatly reduced the affinities of MAB2G12 or CV-N.10 The present structure of cpCV-N and its comparison with wtCV-N lays the foundation for future attempts to optimize and redesign this intriguing molecule.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation cpCV-N was produced and purified as reported.18 The P52G mutant of cpCV-N was created via the QuickChange kit using standard procedures (Strategene; QuickChangee Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit; La Jolla, CA) employing the following forward and reverse primers (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA): 50 -CGACGGTA CCCTGAAATGGCAGGGTTCGAATTTCTCCCAGACC TGCTAC-30 ; 50 -GTAGCAGGTCTGGGAGAAATTCGAA CCCTGCCATTTCAGGGTACCGTCG-30 . Protein expression and purification of the mutant was carried out according to the cpCV-N protocol.18 Uniformly 15N and/or 15N,13C labeling of proteins was achieved using 15 NH4Cl and 13C6-D -glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc; Andover, MA) as sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Sample integrity and purity were assessed by Superdex-75 column chromatography, mass spectroscopy and 2D 1H­ 15N HSQC spectroscopy. It was established that all protein samples investigated here were monomeric.18 Synthesis of branched highmannose oligosaccharides Solution phase synthesis of HM and NM was reported.23 The LTM was prepared using an automated solid phase oligosaccharide synthesizer.24 NMR spectroscopy NMR spectra were recorded on samples of 1­ 1.5 mM N or 15N,13C labeled cpCV-N in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), containing 90% H2O/10% 2H2O. Some spectra were also collected on samples prepared in 2 H2O containing buffer. All experiments were carried out at 27 8C on Bruker DMX500, DRX600, DMX750 and DRX800 spectrometers equipped with x, y, z-shielded gradient triple resonance probes. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe25 and analyzed using NMRView.26 Experiments for assignment of nearly all 1H, 15N, 13CO and 13C backbone and side-chain resonances were described.17 Interproton distance constraints were derived from 2D NOESY, 3D 15N-separated NOE and 4D 13C,13C-separated NOE spectra with mixing times of 200 ms, 100 ms and 120 ms.

on gp120 can only be answered by complete deletion of one of the sites.

Conclusions
Although cpCV-N is extremely similar in structure to wtCV-N, a 1000-fold lower potency in the protein's ability to protect cells from HIV infection was observed.18 The results presented here reconcile these findings. Clearly several differences in the details of the binding sites exist, although it is difficult to assess whether these differences alone could account for the loss in activity. A clear difference between wtCV-N and cpCV-N can be noted in their stabilities: wtCV-N is a very stable molecule, whereas cpCV-N is considerably less tightly packed and somewhat flexible. This could contribute to the significant reduction in activity in cellbased assays, when compared to the less dramatic reduction (, tenfold) in gp120 binding. In this context it should be noted, that after incubation of cpCV-N at 38 8C for a period similar to that used in the cellular assays, ca 15% of cpCV-N is denatured. The binding results presented here demonstrate that cpCV-N contains two sugar-binding sites, both capable of binding the critical a1 ! 2-linked dimannose units on high-mannose sugars. In contrast to wtCV-N, these sites are similar in shape and affinity. Although two molecules of cpCV-N or wtCV-N could bind to one molecule of Man-8 or Man-9, we have no evidence at this point to validate or discard the possibility that cpCV-N simultaneously binds to more than one carbohydrate on gp120. Several mechanistic avenues for inhibiting HIV infection exist: (1) CV-N masks the carbohydrates that play a role in the early stages

and chemical shifts (Ca, Cb and Ha). Structural statistics were evaluated with CNS20 and PROCHECK.21 The minimized-mean structure was calculated for the final ensemble of refined structures. Chemical shifts for the constraints tables (Ca, Cb and Ha) and for TALOS calculations (15N, HN, 13C0 , 13Ca, 13Cb, Ha) were taken from those deposited at the BioMagResBank; accession number 4927. Sugar titration experiments Titrations were performed with protein samples containing 100 mM cpCV-N in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.05% NaN3, 90% H2O/10% 2H2O, and changes in the 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectra recorded at 25 8C were followed after each aliquot addition from stock solutions of 7.7 mM nonamannose, 3.0 mM hexamannose and 7.0 mM trimannoside. The molecular sizes of the complexes at the end of the titration were assessed on the basis of heteronuclear T2 values for the amide protons and nitrogen atoms. These values were previously correlated with analytical ultracentrifugation data.5 Thermal unfolding CD spectra were recorded on a J-720 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Japan) equipped with a temperature control system (NESLAB, USA). The unfolding transitions of cpCV-N and P52GcpCV-N were monitored by measuring the far-UV molar ellipticity at 200 nm on ,15 mM protein samples in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Measurements were performed with a bandwidth of 2 nm, a response time of four seconds and a scan speed of 20 nm/minute. The samples were heated at 1 8C/minute in steps of 0.5 8C over a temperature range from 5 8C to 85 8C. To derive the melting temperature Tm, the molar ellipticity was plotted against the temperature and analyzed by a sigmoidal Boltzmann fit assuming a two-state model. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The atomic coordinates of the structure have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under accession code 1N01 (mean structure) and 1N02 (ensemble of 25 structures and minimized mean structure).

angle constraints were derived from 3JHNHa coupling constants (3D HNHA experiment) in combination with a database search procedure on the basis of backbone (15N, HN, 13C0 , 13Ca, 13Cb, Ha) chemical shifts using the program TALOS.32 Predictions with TALOS were performed with and without wtCV-N in the database. The scalar information (3JNHb/b coupling constants) extracted from the 3D HNHB experiment was used to estimate x1 angles. This information combined with the distance information extracted from the 3D and 4D NOESY experiments was used for stereospecific assignment of resolved b-methylene protons (and a-methylene protons of glycines). 2D HN(CO)CG and HNCG experiments were collected to determine x1 angles of aromatic residues. Residual dipolar couplings (1DNH) were obtained by calculating the difference in the 1JNH splittings measured in 2D IPAP 15N­ 1H HSQC spectra in isotropic and Pf1 liquid crystalline medium. The measured 1DNH values ranged from 2 20 Hz to þ20 Hz. The magnitude of the axial and rhombic components of the alignment tensor DNH were obtained with the program PALES,27 resulting in values of DA ¼ 2 11.6 Hz and R ¼ 0.5, where DA is the axial component of the tensor and R is the rhombicity. Heteronuclear 15N ­ 1H NOEs, T2 and T1 values were used to qualitatively assess local and global mobility. Residues 4 ­ 99 exhibited 15N ­ 1H NOE . 0.65 and no data was obtained for residues 2 1, 1, 2, 3, 100 and 101. Amide hydrogen exchange was investigated by recording 1H­ 15N HSQC spectra of lyophilized protein, freshly dissolved in 2H2O. All amide protons were exchanged after five hours. Hydrogen bond constraints were derived using standard criteria on the basis of the amide H ­ 2H exchange experiments, a 2D experiment for direct detection of hydrogen bonds from backbone three-bond couplings, 13Ca/13Cb secondary shifts and NOE data.

Structure calculation An ensemble of 50 structures was calculated using DYANA19, employing the standard variable target function-simulated annealing protocol with standard parameters. A random coil conformation was used for the starting coordinate file. Calculations were performed for two conformational states of the Pro52 residue. Better agreement was obtained for the trans conformer and all refinement was carried out for the X-P52 trans form. The final set of structures was calculated using the following constraints tables: (1) an upper-limit distance constraints ° table on the basis of NOEs, disulfide bonds (3.10 A for ° for SG-SG) and hydrogen bonds CB-SG and 2.10 A ° ° (2.7 A for H ­O bond and 3.2 A for N ­O); (2) a lowerlimit distance constraints table for the disulfide bonds ° ° (3.00 A for CB-SG and 2.00 A for SG-SG) and hydrogen ° ° bonds (1.7 A for H­ O bond and 2.7 A for N ­ O); (3) a table with backbone dihedral angle constraints from the analysis of chemical shifts with the program TALOS (with dihedral angles ^308) and side-chain x1 angle constraints derived from the analysis of HNHB and (for aromatics) HN(CO)CG and HNCG spectra and interproton NOE information (with values representing the common staggered conformations (x1 ¼ 2 608, 608, or 1808 ^ 208). The ensemble of structures was further refined with a J coupling table containing the 3JHNHa coupling constants measured from the 3D HNHA. Final refinement of these structures was carried out by simulated-annealing in Cartesian space with CNS20 using standard parameters. Additional tables for the CNS refinement included 1DNH residual dipolar couplings
