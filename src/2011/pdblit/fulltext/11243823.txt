A better understanding of how CCPs carry out their biological roles at the structural level is therefore of considerable interest. Poxviruses encode several proteins that mimic components of the complement and chemokine systems in order to modulate the inflammatory response mounted by the host (Kotwal, 2000). Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) was the first soluble microbial protein identified as having complement binding activity, and was postulated to have a role in evasion of host complement (Kotwal and Moss, 1988; Kotwal et al., 1990). It is composed of four complement control protein (CCP) modules (also called SCRs or Sushi domains), making it a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) family (Reid and Day, 1989). VCP exhibits sequence and functional similarity to the mammalian complement regulators, factor H (fH), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay-accelerating factor (DAF), complement receptor type one (CR1), and complement 4b binding protein (C4b-BP)--to which it is most similar in terms of sequence--modules 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively of VCP have 24, 33, 35, and 29 identical or conservatively replaced residues (out of about 60) compared to the equivalent four modules at the N terminus of the chain of C4b-BP. VCP is the smallest and least complex of the complement control proteins with no glycosylation or membrane attachment sites and only 244 amino acids, making it an excellent candidate for structural analysis. VCP has been shown to inhibit the classical pathway of complement activation, with greater potency than human C4b-BP, through its ability to bind C3 and C4 and act as a cofactor for factor I cleavage of C3b and C4b (Kotwal, 1990, 1994; McKenzie et al., 1992). It has also been shown to inhibit the alternative pathway through the same mechanism, resulting in the cleavage of C3b into iC3b, thereby preventing the formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (Sahu et al., 1998). Through this ability to block the host's complement system, VCP has been demonstrated to be capable of preventing antibody-mediated virus neutralization (Isaacs et al., 1992). Therefore, VCP, secreted from virally infected cells, is believed to protect the host cell and release viral progeny from host complement attack. In addition, by blocking complement activation at multiple sites, it reduces levels of C3a, C4a, and C5a proinflammatory chemotactic factors, resulting in reduced cellular influx and inflammation. Support for this comes from in vivo experiments using BALB/c mice injected in the footpad with cowpox virus (CPV) expressing or lacking the VCP homolog in CPV, termed inflammation modulatory protein (IMP, 93% identical to VCP) (Miller et al., 1997). Results showed a significantly greater influx of inflammatory cells into the tissue upon infection with CPV lacking IMP as compared to infection by CPV expressing IMP (Howard et al., 1998; Kotwal et al., 1998). Recently, VCP was shown to possess the ability to bind heparin as well as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (heparin-like molecules, HS) on the surface of human endothelial cells. In this respect, VCP is more similar to

Summary Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) inhibits both pathways of complement activation through binding the third and fourth components. A homolog of mammalian regulators of complement activation, its ability to bind heparin endows VCP with additional activities of significance to viral infectivity. The structure of VCP reveals a highly extended molecule with a putative heparin recognition site at its C-terminal end. A second cluster of positive charges provides a possibly overlapping binding site for both heparin and complement components. Experiments suggested by the structure indicate that VCP can bind heparin and control complement simultaneously. This, the structure of any intact regulator of complement activation, along with attendant functional insights, will stimulate the design of new therapeutic inhibitors of complement. Introduction Inappropriate or undesirable activation of the complement system is the cause of tissue destruction in a long list of clinical situations including ischemia-reperfusion injury, hyperacute rejection of xenogeneic transplants, asthma, restenosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease, and biomaterial incompatibility injury. The potential use of complement control proteins (CCPs) and derivatives as inhibitors of complement activation in these conditions is an intensive area of research (MakTo whom correspondence should be addressed (e-mail: murthy@ onyx.cmc.uab.edu). # Present address: Department of Medical Virology, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.

serum complement control proteins factor H and C4bBP, both of which have been shown to bind heparin (Hessing et al., 1990; Pangburn et al., 1991; Blom et al., 1999). Through this activity, VCP exhibits many properties that have not been demonstrated for other complement control proteins. It has been shown that VCP is taken up by mast cells (localizing in the heparin granules), allowing for tissue retention, possibly increasing its half-life in tissue. VCP has also been shown to bind heparin-like molecules lining the surface of endothelial cells. In vivo studies have indicated that fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled VCP, when injected intravenously, becomes localized in the endothelium. This property of VCP has been shown in vitro to reduce chemotactic migration of leukocytes in the presence and absence of the chemokine MIP-1 (Reynolds et al., 2000). In addition, through this ability to bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans, VCP was able to inhibit antibody binding to MHC class I molecules on human endothelial cells (Smith et al., 2000). VCP has also been shown to block interactions between pig aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) and naive neutrophils and natural killer cells, ¨ preventing cell death (Al-Mohanna and Kowtal, 2001). Moreover, cell culture studies demonstrate that VCP blocks complement-mediated killing of PAECs by human serum, in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the ability of VCP to bind heparin-like molecules plays many physiologically interesting roles and therefore may have a variety of applications. Structures of fragments of MCP (two out of four CCP modules [Casasnovas et al., 1999]) and fH (one [Barlow et al., 1991, 1992] or two [Barlow et al., 1993] out of 20 CCP modules) have been determined. Structures of two pairs of modules in VCP, modules 3 and 4 (VCP3,4, [Wiles et al., 1997]) and VCP2,3 [Henderson et al., 2000]) are also known. None of these fragments--removed from the context of the rest of the protein--shows complement inhibition activity. There is compelling experimental evidence, from work for example on CR1 (Krych et al., 1998) and VCP (Smith et al., 2000), that at least three CCP modules are necessary for regulatory activity.

Although the structure of 2-glycoprotein I ( 2-GPI or apolipoprotein-H), a molecule with four CCP modules has been reported (Bouma et al., 1999; Schwarzenbacher et al., 1999), 2-GPI is not a complement inhibitor. Thus, to date there has been no three-dimensional structure available of a protein or protein fragment that is able to regulate complement activation. In every reported structure of fragments of CCP module containing proteins, each module folds into a compact 6- to 8-stranded structure that has a conformation similar to that originally observed in the structure of fH16 (Barlow et al., 1991). The modules are connected by "linkers" of varying lengths.The relative orientations of neighboring modules differ from one module-pair to another (Barlow et al., 1993; Casasnovas et al., 1999; Gaboriad et al., 2000; Henderson et al., 2000) quite radically and in a manner that is not predictable from differences in primary sequences. Nonetheless, bi-modular orientational preferences have been used in building structures containing three or more CCPs. Such models, conjectured to represent the regulatorily competent forms, have been used to fulfill a long felt need to provide a three-dimensional context for functional and mutational studies of RCA proteins. Examples include models for the structures of VCP (Smith et al., 2000) and MCP (Liszewski et al., 2000). Homology modeling has also been used, perhaps with greater validity, to develop C3dg binding bimodular fragments of CR2 (Molina et al., 1995; Nagar et al., 1998; Prodinger et al., 1998) based on those of fH. However, in the absence of any structure of a functional stretch of CCP modules, such models are speculative. We report here the crystal structure, in two different crystal forms, of VCP that is fully active both in complement inhibition and in binding heparin. This structure offers a picture of the three-dimensional juxtaposition of the full set of CCP domains necessary for a wellcharacterized complement inhibitory activity. Unlike studies of fragments, this structure is not susceptible to the criticism that deletion of modules might have destabilized the structures of the remaining modules

Figure 2. Orientations of CCP Module Containing Proteins Are Diverse The four modules of VCP are shown in red and labeled. (a) The first CCP module of MCP (gold) is superimposed over module 1 of VCP using the sheet residues in each to calculate the transformation. Similarly module 2 of the solution structure of VCP2,3 (rose) is superimposed over that of VCP2 and module 3 of the solution structure of VCP3,4 (purple) superimposed over module 3 of VCP. (b) The first CCP module of VCP is superimposed over module 1 of 2GPI (light blue). Modules 1­4 in each are labeled. Not shown is an additional membrane association domain beyond domain 4 in 2GPI.

and altered orientations at intermodular junctions. Analysis of the distribution of surface charge on the molecule and correlation of structural features with some new and existing functional studies on CCPs suggests likely locations for interaction of VCP with heparin, C3b, and C4b. In addition, the presence of a putative heparin binding site at one end of an elongated VCP might permit it to associate with negatively charged cell surfaces, enabling it to mimic the function of other RCA family proteins closely. The high level of sequence similarity between VCP and the mammalian regulators of complement activation (fH, MCP, DAF, CR1, and particularly C4b-BP) and to complement receptor type 2 (CR2) means that this VCP structure will provide the richest and most reliable source of information yet available for modeling other functional stretches of three-to-four CCPs by homology and for the design and interpretation

of mutagenesis experiments aimed at understanding the structural basis of complement control. Results and Discussion Structure of VCP In both the crystal forms of VCP that were analyzed, the molecule has an elongated structure with no intramolecular contacts between nonsequential modules (Figure 1). Packing of the two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit of form I crystals is head-to-tail, with CCP module 4 of each molecule making electrostatic and van der Waals contacts with module 1 of the other; thus an approximately 2-fold rotation relates the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In form II crystals, on the other hand, the three molecules (C, D, and E) in the asymmetric unit are related by an approximate 3-fold rotation, with translations moving molecules C and E by roughly half their lengths along the axis of rotation such that modules 3 and 4 of D interact with modules 1 and 2 of both C and E. Packing interactions within the asymmetric units of both crystal forms do not show evidence of specific multimerization of VCP molecules. All five crystallographically independent molecules in the two structures are highly similar in structure, as reflected in root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.28, ° 0.67, 0.68, and 0.69 A, between C atoms in the strands of molecule A and those of B, C, D, and E (Figure 1), respectively. At the module level, a very similar overall fold has been observed within several structures of RCA members and their fragments (Barlow et al., 1991, 1992, 1993; Wiles et al., 1997; Casasnovas et al., 1999; Gaboriad et al., 2000). The originally observed 6 strand topology is closely emulated by all CCP modules of both copies of VCP within the asymmetric unit of form I crystals. In regions where residues could be located in electron density maps, all CCP modules comprising each of the three molecules within the asymmetric unit of form II crystals also conform to this topology. Module 1 is remarkable for its prominent "hypervariable" loop of ten residues (Lys14­Ala23, compared to two, four, and five residues in modules 2, 3, and 4, respectively) projecting laterally from VCP close to the N-terminal tip of the molecule. Module 1 also has an unusual insertion (Gln42, Lys43) that forms a prominent bulge close to the interface with module 2. Module 2 has a five residue

insertion (Leu109­Ser114) that forms a long loop close to the interface with module 1. As suggested by the rms deviations, the relative orientations of each of the four modules are also remarkably similar among all five molecules despite their being crystallographically independent (Figure 1). This suggests that crystal packing interactions are not responsible for the conformation observed, but rather that a strongly preferred conformation of VCP exists in solution under the conditions used to grow the crystals. The "tilt" (i.e., the rotation required to align the z-axis of the inertia tensor of each module with its neighbor) angles between the long axes of the modules are 60 , 63 , and 99 at the 1­2, 2­3, and 3­4 module junctions, respectively. However, the tilts between adjacent pairs of modules are in almost diametrically opposite directions so that module 3 is tilted by only 10 relative to module 1 and module 4 is tilted by 36 relative to module 2. Thus, the molecule has an extended and approximately linear part consisting of modules 1­3, then a kink between modules 1­3 and module 4. Atomic interactions at the 1­2 interface in VCP are between mostly hydrophilic residues while those at the 2­3 interface are mixed and those at the 3­4 interface are predominantly hydrophobic. The ° 1­2 module interface buries 454 A2 of accessible surface ° compared to 281 and 408 A2, respectively, for the 2­3 and 3­4 interfaces. Figure 2a superimposes the structures of VCP and MCP1,2 (Casasnovas et al., 1999). The arrangement of the N-terminal MCP modules differ from that in VCP, providing another example of the significant variation in intermodular orientations among this family of proteins. This study also allows comparison of the structure of

intact VCP in the crystal with solution studies on VCP fragments (Figure 2a). The angles between modules 3 and 4 of the NMR structure of VCP3,4 (tilt 67 , twist 81 , and skew 7 ; see Wiles et al., 1997 for a definition of these angles), are comparable to those seen in the crystal structure (tilt 99 , twist 74 , and skew 20 ). The 2­3 intermodular angles within the NMR structure of VCP2,3, on the other hand, are dissimilar to those in the crystal structure of intact VCP (Figure 2a). Moreover ° 281 A2 of surface is buried between modules 2 and 3 in the crystal, while the junction between these two modules is not extensive in the VCP2,3 fragment (Kirkitadze et al., 1999) and NMR indicates that this pair is flexible on a 10 7 to 10 8 time scale (Henderson et al., 2000). It is noticeable that there are significant differences in the structure of module 2 between intact and truncated forms of VCP, while modules 3 and 4 show only small differences (Figure 2a). The lack of module 1 might destabilize module 2 in VCP2,3 and hence the 2,3 junction; for example the Leu109­Ser114 insertion in module 2 is a mobile loop in VCP2,3, but has moved by ° some 15 A in the crystal structure and contacts the Gln42,Lys43 insertion of module 1. Modules 2 and 3 might also stabilize each other, but to a lesser extent, which could explain the smaller differences between the arrangement of modules 2 and 4 in intact VCP compared to the VCP3,4 fragment. It is clear from these comparisons that the structure of VCP reported here, that of an intact complement control protein, represents a significant advance over previous structural studies based on fragments--its validity does not rely on the assumption that CCP modules are structurally independent of the remainder of the protein. This structure may therefore

Structure of Vaccinia Complement Regulatory Protein 305

be considered the most reliable basis yet for the design of mutagenesis experiments and homology modeling exercises. A striking feature of each VCP molecule is the charge distribution on the four domains. A concentration of basic residues in modules 1 and 4 makes them highly positively charged with a number of Lys and Arg residues contributing to the charge density (Figures 3a and 3b). Most of the residues with carboxylic acid side chains are clustered in modules 2 and 3 with those two modules carrying a net negative charge. This charge distribution, taken together with the highly extended shape of VCP revealed in this study, produces a distinctly asymmetric distribution of the electrostatic field around each molecule, with module 4 being surrounded by an intense positive field that extends significantly beyond its van der Waals footprint, module 1 having a more textured although mostly positive field around it and the middle two domains being surrounded by a predominantly negative field (Figure 3c).

Figure 5. Stereo View of Interaction of VCP with Heparin A C trace of residues 213­242 of VCP is shown in orange. Carbohydrate is shown with carbons colored gray; oxygen, red; nitrogen, blue; and sulfur, yellow. Side chains of the four basic residues of acidic and basic FGF and VCP that were superimposed are shown in red, magenta, and cyan, respectively. VCP side chains are labeled. The figure was composed using a rigid body transformation of VCP main chain on to the basic FGF heparin binding segment. The side chains of the Lys residues in VCP have been rotated to point toward the heparin fragment. The side chain of Lys 214 is beyond hydrogen bonding distance from heparin as currently modeled. Main chain ° movements of 1­2 A will be required to bring its side chain within interacting distance.

Interaction of VCP with C3 and C4 A pervasive theme that runs through descriptions of molecular interactions between complement regulatory factors fH, CR1, and CR2 with C3 is the involvement of carboxyl residues on C3 and basic residues on the regulatory factors. The structure of C3d (Nagar et al., 1998), and subsequent mutational analysis (Clemenza and Isenman, 2000) have identified glutamyl residues (mature C3 numbering) 1008, 1010, 1131, and 1137 as well as Asp 1134 as providing contacts to CR2. Residues Glu736 and Glu737 have been identified as contributing major contacts for interaction of C3(H2O) with fB and CR1 (Oran and Isenman, 1999). Mutagenesis of residues within C3 (Oran and Isenman, 1999), use of blocking antibodies (Alsenz et al., 1990), and synthetic mimetics (Fishelson, 1991) have been used to show that residues Glu-744 and Glu-747 make major contributions to binding of fH by C3(H2O). Conversely, mutagenesis experiments that have either reduced the negative charge or increased the positive charge in CR1 by substitution of acidic or basic residues, respectively, near putative interaction sites have increased binding to C3 (Krych et al., 1998). Similarly, several basic residues between CCP modules 1 and 2 in CR2 have been identified as possible ligands for C3d (Prodinger et al., 1998) and a cluster of positively charged residues at the interface between C4b-BP modules 1 and 2 have been shown to be crucial for C4b binding (Blom et al., 1999). Analogous observations, based on conserved sequence motifs, have also been made for fH (Soames et al., 1996). It appears, therefore, that interaction of positively charged portions of complement regulators CR1, CR2, C4b-BP, and fH with negatively charged regions on C3/C4 makes a significant, if not a dominant, contribution to their interaction. The close functional and structural resemblance of VCP to other complement control proteins strongly suggests that its interactions with C3b would also involve patches of positive charge, although other regions are also likely to be involved. Charge distribution on the VCP molecule (Figures 3a and 3b) suggests that an ionic

interaction with C3 can take place through either module 1 and 2 or module 4. However, experiments with truncated versions have shown that VCP that has lost module 1 is incapable of complement inhibition (Smith et al., 2000), while a close relative of VCP, the monkey pox virus (MPV) homolog, without a large portion of module 4, is still competent (Smith et al., 2000). Thus the positive patch, to which Arg 7, Lys 12, Lys 14, Arg 40, Lys 41, Lys 43, Lys 50, Lys 64, Arg 65, and Arg 66 contribute (Figure 3b), which straddles modules 1 and 2, might be one point of contact between VCP and C3/C4 responsible for its complement regulatory activity. Additional putative sites on VCP for interaction with C3b/C4b are suggested by comparison with other complement control proteins for which extensive mutagenesis data are available. A recent study employing synthetic peptides, mutagenesis, and epitope mapping of MCP is one of the most comprehensive (Liszewski et al., 2000). An alanine-scan of MCP from residues 94­103 (Figure 4a) proved particularly interesting. The mutations Y97A, Y98A, L99A, and E103A each abolished cofactor activity for C4b but not binding of C4b, while N94A, E95A, G96A, and E102A decreased both C4b binding and cofactor activity (C3b binding was affected only by E102A). The equivalent residues in VCP are also 94­103, are close in sequence (Figure 4a), and lie in module 2 near the interface with module 3. In VCP, the conserved Tyr97 and Leu99 are buried and substitution with alanine is likely to be structurally disruptive, while Gly96 is in a turn and probably also of structural importance; the side chains of Asn94, Ser95 (Glu in MCP), His98 (Tyr in MCP), Glu102, and Ser103 (Glu in MCP), on the other hand, are surface exposed. Thus, by homology with the VCP structure, it is likely that residues 94, 95, 98, 102, and 103 of MCP (Figure 4a, red) are involved directly in intermolecular contacts, and that Asn94, Glu95, and Glu102

The degree of hemolysis inhibition caused by heparan sulfate alone is shown as asterisks.

The material in lane 3 probably represents the fraction of rVCP that was incompetent in binding due to misfolding.

directly contact C4b. It is reasonable to propose that Asn94, His 98, and Glu102 (Figures 4a and 4b, red) play a similar role in VCP. The same study (Liszewski et al., 2000) indicated that the region 191­196 (Figure 4a) of MCP appeared important for C3b binding; thus individual substitutions of K193, R195, and F196 by alanine interfered with both C3b binding and cofactor activity for C3b. In VCP, the equivalent region is 184­189 (Figure 4a) and lies at the C terminus of module 3 with Lys186 and His189 solvent exposed and is probably not of fundamental structural importance. Thus, by homology with VCP it is likely that Lys193 and Phe196 of MCP (Figure 4a, magenta) contact C3b; again, it is reasonable to propose that Lys186 and His189 of VCP (Figures 4a and 4b, magenta) play a similar role. Finally, in MCP, residues in the region 206­212 (Figure 4a) appeared to be involved in C3b binding since the mutations G207A, F208A, K210A, K211A, and F212A each significantly degrade affinity for C3b (but not C4b). In VCP, these residues lie within the sequence 199­205 (Figure 4a),which includes the hypervariable bulge of module 4 with Phe201 and Arg203 prominent on the surface. By homology with the structure of VCP, Phe208 and Lys210 of MCP (Figure 4, yellow) are likely to be contact points for C3b. Although it is not unreasonable to invoke Phe201 and Arg203 (Figures 4a and 4b, yellow) as C3b binding residues in VCP, most of this module, including residues 208 and 210, is missing from its MPV homolog and therefore does not appear to be pivotal for function. In summary, by analogy with its close relatives, C4b-

BP, CR2, MCP, and CR1, a number of sites on VCP probably interact with C3b and C4b. The structure of VCP allows these sites to be visualized to allow identification of surface-exposed residues likely to be involved directly in contacts. These are summarized in Figure 4b and are good candidates for future mutagenesis studies of VCP. The structure also allows the spatial relationship of these putative binding sites, as well as their relation to the positive patch that is between modules 1 and 2, to be visualized (Figure 4b). Heparin Binding and Hemolysis Inhibition by VCP Among the mammalian proteins shown to have complement control ability, only the serum proteins C4b-BP and fH have heparin binding activity. Binding sites for heparin on CCP modules 1 and 2 on the chain of C4bBP (Blom et al., 1999; Hessing et al., 1990) and on CCP modules 7, 20, and 13 for fH (Sharma and Pangburn, 1996; Blackmore et al., 1998) have been identified. VCP has been shown to possess a strong heparin binding ability and experiments have indicated the possible presence of two heparin binding sites on modules 1 and 4, respectively (Reynolds et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2000). The structure of VCP confirms that there are two spatially distinct putative heparin binding sites in the molecule. VCP, in the crystal structures, appears to be a long molecule with large positively charged domains at its two ends (Figures 3a and 3b); a large patch of positive charge is located on domain 4, while a second large positive patch straddles domains 1 and 2.

tein interactions are dominated by charge interactions between negatively charged groups on heparin and positively charged groups on proteins. Heparin binding sequence motifs in proteins consisting of suitably spaced Lys and Arg residues have been proposed (Margalit et al., 1993) and such motifs have been identified in VCP (Smith et al., 2000). Structures of acidic (DiGabriele et al., 1998; Schlessinger et al., 2000) and basic (Faham et al., 1996) fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) complexed with heparin have offered insights into details of binding of heparin by proteins. Modeling of heparin binding to VCP employing FGF as template and using Insight II (Biosym-Technologies, 2000) shows that carbon atoms of a quartet of Lys residues 214, 216, 220, and 241 in a flexible region of module 4 could be superimposed on corresponding atoms of four basic residues, Lys113, Arg119, Arg112, and Lys 128 in acidic FGF, which make major interactions with heparin in the complex (DiGabriele et al., 1998; Schlessinger et al., 2000), ° with an rms deviation of 2 A. All the ligands in module 4 are either end residues of strands or are in flexible loops between strands (Figure 5). Similarly, residues Lys 64, Arg 65, and Arg 66 in module 1 and the linker connecting modules 1 and 2 can be superimposed on residues Lys 122, Lys 118, and Arg 119 of FGF with a ° deviation of 1 A. These two putative heparin binding ° regions are separated by about 80 A. Figure 5 shows a stereo view of the model for the site at the tip of module 4. It is significant that the model for VCP interactions with heparin resembles that in the FGFs closely, an unrelated protein, indicating heparin-protein recognition mode of wide applicability. Since VCP is an extended molecule, and given the probable location of a heparin binding site at the extreme C-terminal end and putative regions involved in

binding complement spread throughout the remainder of this extended molecule, it might be expected that C3b/ C4b interactions and heparin binding are not mutually exclusive. Participation of common residues in heparin binding and complement inhibition in VCP is not supported by the observation that VCP is able to inhibit hemolysis of sensitized sheep red blood cells and bind heparin simultaneously (Figure 6). Addition of varying amounts of soluble HS to a hemolysis assay containing VCP had no effect on the protein's ability to inhibit hemolysis (Figure 6a). A similar experiment employing heparin sepharose beads, used to carry VCP into the hemolysis assay, revealed that VCP can still inhibit complement activation while remaining bound to insoluble heparin, although to a much lesser extent (Figure 6b). The reaction mixture was further examined after the assay was performed in order to determine whether VCP inhibits hemolysis while bound to heparin, or is pulled off by C3 and C4 during the reaction. Figure 6c clearly demonstrates that the hemolysis-inhibiting activity could be attributed to VCP that remained bound to the heparin sepharose beads and was not detached from the beads in the process. These experiments imply that the protein, in addition to its ability to strongly inhibit complement activation while in soluble form, may also inhibit complement while bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans lining the endothelial cell layer. VCP would therefore be able to protect the infected host cell, and neighboring cells, from not only host complement attack, but also antibody binding and cell death caused by natural killer cells. Complement activation either through the classical or the alternative pathway occurs on cell surfaces, which in addition to identifying cells as "foreign", limits the possibility of a "runaway" reaction that could result in

deleterious host tissue destruction (Hughes-Jones, 1986; Pangburn, 1986). Although experiments with soluble versions of MCP, DAF, and CR1 have shown that all of them are capable of displaying regulatory activity in solution (Reid and Day, 1989), in their native state they are associated with the cell surface, presumably because such association would be an efficient way of regulating surface-bound components of the pathway such as the C3 and C5 convertases. Different strategies for surface association have been adopted by different regulators. MCP (Liszewski et al., 1991), CR1, and CR2 (Ahearn and Fearon, 1989) associate with cell surfaces through transmembrane regions. On the other hand, DAF associates with cell surfaces through a glycosyl phospatidyl inositol membrane anchor (Coyne et al., 1992). However, C4b-BP, fH, and VCP, among proteins shown to possess complement regulatory ability, are not bound to surfaces in their native state and all of them are now known to bind heparin. Both the serum complement regulators fH and C4b-BP, as well as VCP, probably bind to cell surfaces for the same reason that other CCPs are associated with cell surfaces; in order to regulate cell surface associated components more efficiently. Such a role for heparin binding by C4b-BP has indeed, been explored extensively (Meri and Pangburn, 1994; Sharma and Pangburn, 1996; Blom et al., 1999). In factor H there are three heparin binding sites on CCP modules 7, 13, and 20 (Sharma and Pangburn, 1996). It has been reported that binding of heparin increases binding of fH to C3b, enhancing both its decay acceleration and cofactor activities (Meri and Pangburn, 1994). C4b-BP is a bigger and more complex protein than VCP, with seven identical, extended chains, each with eight CCP modules and a single chain with three CCP modules (Hillcarp and Dahlback, 1988). Mutational and proteolytic fragmentation studies have identified several basic residues between the first two modules of the chain, including Arg 39, Arg 64, and Arg 66, to be important for both heparin binding and C4b binding (Blom et al., 1999). The same study provided an explanation for the multivalency of C4b-BP by suggesting that some of heparin/C4b binding sites on the eight chains would help C4b-BP bind to heparin on cell surfaces while the rest would be able to interact with surfacedeposited C4b in the vicinity. Thus, it appears plausible to suggest that VCP might use heparin binding as a means of cell-surface association. Like its very close homolog, C4b-BP, VCP has a site between modules 1 and 2 that is likely a dual heparin and C4b binding site; however, VCP also has a second putative heparin binding site on module 4. Since it is small and monomeric, VCP could not carry out its function efficiently if binding to heparin occluded its complement interacting surfaces; this would explain the introduction, through a process of molecular evolution, of the additional heparin binding site on module 4. The stronger and more extensive electrostatic field that surrounds module 4 would also be instrumental in orienting and driving the molecule to bring about rapid surface association through the heparin binding site on this module. The decrease in hemolysis activity, depicted in Figure 6b, for VCP bound to sepharose heparin beads compared to free VCP also supports this notion. VCP that is bound to

beads or to cell surfaces through its heparin/C4b binding site would be incapable of participating in inhibiting hemolysis because C3/C4 binding sites would be blocked. Furthermore, VCP bound to beads through module 4 would be unavailable to associate with cell surfaces, thus making it less efficient in inhibiting hemolysis. A geometric arrangement of surface association sites with respect to functional sites similarly to that in VCP has been observed in the structure of 2GPI (Bouma et al., 1999; Schwarzenbacher et al., 1999), which although not possessing complement regulatory activity, is made up of CCPs and binds to cell membranes. The binding site for anionic phospholipids in 2GPI, composed of a number of basic and several hydrophobic residues, is at the tip of the fifth module of that protein with antibody binding sites distributed over the remaining four modules. In conclusion, the structure of VCP displays several interesting features that are of relevance to its complement regulation and heparin binding activities. This structure of a protein that regulates complement activation provides a structural framework for interpretation of existing mutational and functional data on homologous human complement regulatory proteins. This is exemplified by comparison of VCP with MCP, which allows rationalization of previously performed alanine-scan mutagenesis of MCP, indicating residues that make direct interactions as opposed to those that are structurally important. The structure will also provide a platform for design of future experiments for a detailed dissection of structure-function relations of VCP and other RCA proteins. The data on C3b and C4b binding to MCP indicate that probable contact points for interaction of C3b and C4b with VCP are located primarily on the first three modules. Although there are two potential heparin binding sites, experiments with truncated versions of the protein and the observation that heparin binding and complement inhibition by VCP are not mutually exclusive, suggests that the site on module 4 is likely to be the primary binding site for heparin. These observations, along with the electrostatic attributes of VCP, lead to a plausible model for cell-surface association of VCP that would make it functionally similar to membrane associated regulators such as MCP, DAF, and CR1, although the mechanism of surface association is different. Finally, these findings will underpin the design of therapeutic regulators of complement. The vaccinia virus appears to have arrived at an elegant solution to the problem of how to encapsulate an efficient strategy for surface-targeted complement inhibition in a small, soluble, unglycosylated protein. The availability of this structure provides the opportunity for further engineering to produce a more potent inhibitor of use in the clinic.
Experimental Procedures Purification of VCP The cloning of VCP in the Pichia pastoris yeast expression system (Invitrogen) was described previously (Smith et al., 2000). Two milliliters of buffered glycerol-complex medium (BMGY) was inoculated and grown at 30 C overnight. This starter culture was then used to inoculate two liters of BMGY contained within two large, four liter flasks. The cultures were then grown at 30 C for two days with vigorous shaking. The cells were then harvested by centrifuging for

Structure of Vaccinia Complement Regulatory Protein 309

30 min at 3500 rpm. After resuspending the cells in two liters of buffered methanol-complex medium (BMMY) containing 4% methanol, the cells were again incubated for two days with vigorous shaking. The VCP-containing media was then collected after centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 1 hr. The two liters of media were then concentrated to 50 ml using a 300 ml Amicon stirred-cell (with 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off). Half of the media was then purified using three 5 ml HiTrap heparin columns (Pharmacia) linked in series, as to make one large 15 ml column. After passing the media through at a rate of 1 ml/min, the column was then washed with 30 ml of 100 mM NaCl, and the protein eluted with 15 ml NaCl ranging from 250 mM to 550 mM. The fractions were then visualized by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining. This was repeated for the second half of the media and fractions containing the most highly pure rVCP were pooled, concentrated using a 50 ml Amicon stirred-cell, and superconcentrated and desalted using several 2 ml Millipore Centricon centrifugal filters. Protein concentrations were predicted using a BioRad protein estimation kit, and the specific activity of the samples was determined by hemolysis assay. Heparan/Heparin Hemolysis Assay Hemolysis assays were performed as described earlier (Kotwal et al., 1990), with a few modifications. Serial dilutions of VCP were mixed with various amounts of heparan sulfate (HS) (Sigma) before addition of serum and sensitized sheep red blood cells. In assays using heparin sepharose, 10 l of slurry, made from 1 ml heparin sepharose (Pharmacia) and 1 ml water, was added to a series of VCP dilutions and incubated for 30 min on ice. After the incubation, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatants tested for hemolysis activity. The heparin sepharose beads were then washed with buffer before serum and sensitized sheep red blood cells were added. After the assay was performed, reaction supernatants and the pelleted heparin sepharose beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of rVCP. Supernatants were concentrated and the heparin beads resuspended in 600 mM NaCl to strip off rVCP and concentrated. In all cases, both positive and negative controls received the same amount of heparin/heparan as all of the samples, in order to compensate for lysis inhibition caused by the heparin/ heparan. Crystallization Two crystal forms, form I and form II, of VCP expressed in yeast were grown. Both were obtained using a protein concentration of 5­12 mg/ml in 20 mM TRIS (pH 7.5 [form I] and 8.3 [form II]) and 100 mM NaCl. Form I crystals were grown using 10% PEG 6000 and form II crystals using 8%­12% PEG 8000 in hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments over 7­10 days at 20 C. Data Measurement, Phasing, and Refinement All X-ray measurements were performed on frozen crystals. The space group of form I crystals was determined to be P212121, with a 65.3, b 115.4 and c 121.9, and that of form II crystals as C222, with a 99.2, b 110.3 and c 268.7 on an in house R-axis II system mounted on a Rigaku X-ray source; the two forms had two and three molecules of VCP in the asymmetric unit, respectively. A heavy atom search yielded a promising europium (1 mM EuCl3, overnight) derivative for form I and a gold (3 mM AuCl3, overnight) derivative for form II crystals. MAD (Hendrickson, 1994; ° Krishna Murthy, 1996) data for Eu derivative of form I (2.5 A) and ° Au derivative of form II crystals (2.8 A) were measured on beamline X4A at NSLS at three wavelengths spanning the respective L (III) edges (Table 1). Data were processed using d*trek (Pflugrath, 1999) and MAD phases calculated by SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999) with figures of merit shown in Table 1. Initial models were built with O (Jones et al., 1991) into maps calculated using phases (figures of merit in Table 1) obtained after refinement (MLPHARE [Otwinowski, 1991]) and density modification (DM [Cowtan, 1994]). Noncrystallographic symmetry transformations were determined from the initial atomic models in both cases and used in refinements. The structures were refined in XPLOR (Brunger, 1990) against data at the remote high energy for each crystal form. The models were then placed in their respective native cells and refined against native data to final R values of 0.198 and 0.204, using all data with Fobs

° ° 2 Fobs, a lower resolution of 8 A and a higher resolution of 2.2 A ° and 2.64 A, respectively, for the two crystal forms. The refinements were monitored throughout using free R values calculated on 10% of the reflections, in each case chosen randomly to span the used resolution range. The terminal Arg residue is not visible in density maps in any of the five molecules. All atoms of all other residues (1­243) are present in both molecules of the asymmetric unit of form I crystals; however, residues 43­45, 110, 209, and 227 in molecule A have high B factors as do residues 209 and 227 in molecule B. All three molecules in the asymmetric unit of form II crystals have residues that could not be located in maps: 4­7, 14­21, 23­24, 54, 58, 75, 111, and 207 in molecule C, residues 54, 58, 75, 111, 126, 202, 217­219, 220, 222, and 223 in molecule D, and residues 53, 54, 58, 75, 111, 126, 159, 160, 162, 184, 186, 202, and 217 in molecule E. No residues are in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran map; some geometric statistics are given in Table 1. Figure 1 was made using Insight II (Biosym-Technologies, 2000), Figures 2, 3, and 4 using GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991), and Figure 5 using RIBBONS (Carson, 1987).
