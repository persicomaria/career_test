As many protooncogenes are protein tyrosine kinases, it is logical to anticipate that protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) could function as tumour suppressors. Although the first amino acid sequences corresponding to the PTPases were reported in 1990, almost ten years passed without a convincing example of a PTPase that functions as a tumour suppressor. This changed in 1997 when two groups reported the discovery of a candidate tumoursuppressor gene, PTEN/MMAC1 (for: `phosphatase and tensin homologue' or `mutated in multiple advanced cancers'), that mapped to chromosome 10q231,2. The candidate gene product shares sequence identity with the PTPase family and also chicken tensin. PTEN is deleted or mutated in a wide variety of tumours (including glioma, breast and kidney), tumour cell lines and xenographs1,2. Germline transmission of mutations in PTEN were also observed in Cowden disease3 and BannayanZonana Syndrome4, which is often characterized by an increased prevalence of breast and thyroid malignancies5. Recent reports of the phenotype of mice harbouring a disruption to the gene encoding PTEN support the conclusion that PTEN functions as a tumour-suppressor gene6,7. Homozygous disruption of PTEN results in early embryonic lethality, and heterozygous PTEN mice display hyperplastic­ dysplastic changes in the prostate, skin and colon, which are also seen in Cowden disease. PTEN contains the invariant signature motif Cys(X)5Arg, which defines the PTPase supergene family8. Within this catalytic domain, the cysteine residue is essential for catalysis, and the arginine residue plays a crucial role in binding of the phosphoryl group of the substrate8,9. Knowledge of the catalytic mechanism provides a rational basis for understanding a number of the mutations reported within the gene encoding PTEN. Fig. 1a shows a collection of PTEN mutations. Many of these missense mutations fall within the phosphatase domain, including several within the highly conserved signature motif, suggesting that phosphatase activity is essential for the physiological function of PTEN in tumour suppression. In addition, numerous frameshift and nonsense mutations are located in the C-terminal region (Fig. 1a). Although the roles of the C-terminus remain unclear, the number of mutations found in this region raises the distinct possibility that this portion of the protein has an important noncatalytic function. A search for PTEN substrate(s) Reports describing the first example of a tumoursuppressor gene with sequence identity to the PTPases stimulated numerous groups to search for potential protein substrates for the phosphatase. Yamada and his colleagues10,11 reported that PTEN overexpression leads to changes in cell migration and dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Biochemical studies from our laboratory12 and others13 noted that recombinant PTEN poorly dephosphorylated a number of artificial substrates. In fact, the greatest catalytic activity observed for any substrate was obtained using the highly

PTEN: a tumour suppressor that functions as a phospholipid phosphatase
Tomohiko Maehama and Jack E. Dixon

The tumour suppressor PTEN has been implicated in a large number of human tumours and is conserved from humans to worms. Characterization of PTEN protein showed that it is a phosphatase that acts on proteins and on 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)trisphosphate, and can therefore modulate signal-transduction pathways that involve lipid second messengers. Recent results indicate that at least part of its role is to regulate the activity of the serine/threonine kinase AKT/PKB, and thus influence cell survival signalling. This article discusses the function of PTEN and how this could be linked to its activity as a tumour suppressor.

negatively charged multiply phosphorylated polymer of (Glu-Tyr)n13. This observation suggested that PTEN prefers highly acidic substrates rather than Tyr or Ser/Thr phosphoproteins. One class of molecules that fulfils this criteria is phosphoinositides. To explore this possibility, Maehama and Dixon14 transfected PTEN into 293 cells and analysed the changes in cellular phosphoinositides. Overexpression of PTEN reduced insulin-induced phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] production in human 293 cells without affecting insulininduced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. Furthermore, transfection of a catalytically inactive mutant of PTEN (C124S) resulted in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation in the absence of insulin stimulation. Purified recombinant PTEN catalysed the dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, specifically at position 3 on the inositol ring. PTEN also exhibited 3-phosphatase activity towards inositol (1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate. These results raise the possibility that PTEN acts in vivo as a phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase, thereby regulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels. Moreover, the recombinant C124S mutant of PTEN was incapable of dephosphorylating

PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. This suggests that the dephosphorylation proceeds by a mechanism similar to that described for the PTPases8,9. Thus, the studies so far have identified both protein and lipid substrates. Is it possible for a Cys(X)5Arg phosphatase to function physiologically in the dephosphorylation of both phosphoproteins and phospholipid substrates? There is no precedent for a phosphatase having two such activities, but there are well-known examples of kinases that utilize both lipids and proteins as substrates15, so the idea does not seem unreasonable. To understand fully the biological implications of PTEN functioning as a phosphoinositide phosphatase, it is necessary to review briefly the mechanism of insulin signalling in mammals. Fig. 2 shows the steps involved in mammalian insulin signalling. Following stimulation of the insulin receptor by ligand, signals are transduced in a cascade via the insulin receptor substrate protein (IRS) activating PI3K, which in turn generates the phosphoinositide second messengers16. These messengers activate the Ser/Thr kinase AKT/PKB, which modulates the

activity of a variety of downstream proteins, including transcription factors and glucose transporters17,18. AKT/PKB is also known to play an important role in generating cell-survival signals17. This predicts that, if PTEN functions in vivo as a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase, then homozygous deletion/mutation of this tumour-suppressor gene could lead to a tumorigenic state through activation of the protooncogene product AKT/PKB (Fig. 2). Specifically, loss of PTEN function would increase cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, thereby resulting in enhanced activation of the ATK protein kinase (Fig. 2). Recently, it was shown that elevation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and constitutive activation of AKT/PKB occur in cells isolated from the PTEN-deficient mouse7. Interestingly, some mutations of PTEN that occur in primary gliomas and Cowden disease result in a specific loss of lipid phosphatase activity19. Furnari et al.20 reported that the specific mutations in PTEN that lead to a loss of lipid phosphatase activity could account for the growth-suppression activity observed in glioma cells.

as Wu et al.22 have also suggested that PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. Together, these results strongly support a hypothesis that PTEN acts as a physiological regulator of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels, thereby modulating cell growth and survival. In addition, the important role that AKT/PKB17 plays in apoptosis provides a rational explanation for the tumour-suppressor function of PTEN, although other PTEN targets, such as FAK, could also be relevant for tumour suppression. The PTEN signature sequence? If PTEN acts to dephosphorylate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vivo, it is reasonable to question whether PTEN bears any similarity to enzymes known to catalyse the dephosphorylation of inositol phosphates or phosphoinositides. Majerus and colleagues23 have described a family of metal-dependent/Li -inhibited inositol phosphatases that have structural similarity to the fold of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. This family of proteins shares a metal-binding sequence and bears no resemblance to the Cys(X)5Arg PTPase family. Recently, a metal-independent protein from Salmonella dublin, SopB, was shown to hydrolyse inositol (1,3,4,5,6)-pentakisphosphate to yield inositol (1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate, a signalling molecule that indirectly increases chloride secretion in the gastrointestinal tract. SopB shares sequence identity with a recently described mammalian inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase24. Surprisingly, SopB and mammalian polyphosphate 4-phosphatase contain a Cys(X)5Arg motif, suggesting that they use a catalytic mechanism similar to the PTPases. Careful inspection of the putative active-site sequences reveals that SopB, the mammalian inositol phosphatase and PTEN all share an identical spacing of three basic amino acid residues (Fig. 1b). One invariant Lys follows the catalytic Cys, and a second invariant Lys is positioned two residues N-terminal to the Arg in the active site (CysLys-Ala-Gly-Lys-Gly-Arg). Could these basic residues define a signature sequence for the binding and hydrolysis of the phosphoinositides? If one examines the active site motifs of all PTPases, only PTEN family members have basic residues at these sites (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, a yeast `homologue' of PTEN (Saccharomyces cerevisiae YNL128W) also contains identically spaced basic residues in its active site (Fig. 1c), suggesting that this enzyme could play a role in yeast phosphoinositide metabolism. Genetic analysis of PTEN in the worm Several of the steps involved in insulin signalling in mammals are conserved in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 2). The DAF-2 protein of the worm functions in a manner similar to the complex between insulin receptor and IRS. DAF-2 appears to activate AGE-1, a protein with sequence identity to the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, which produces PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. There are two C. elegans AKT/PKB homologues (AKT-1 and AKT-2) that are genetically downstream from AGE-1 and would be expected to be activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P325. Genetic analysis of C. elegans showed that DAF-16/Fork head/HNF-3

PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which is produced from phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (AGE-1) upon stimulation of insulin receptor (DAF-2), activates the downstream kinase Akt/PKB (AKT-1/AKT-2) and other effectors. PTEN (DAF-18), associated with the plasma membrane via an unknown mechanism, catalyses dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, producing PtdIns(4,5)P2 and thereby blocking the downstream signals.

transcription factor is a major negatively regulated target of DAF2­AGE-1­AKT-1/AKT-2 signalling, plays a key role in metabolism, dauer larva arrest and longevity in the worm25,26. The high degree of conservation of this signal-transduction pathway between mammals and C. elegans suggests that genetic analysis in the worm might identify genes that antagonize AGE-1 and would thus be orthologous to the mammalian gene encoding PTEN. Ogg and Ruvkun27 have recently undertaken such a study and have demonstrated that the C. elegans PTEN, DAF-18, acts in the insulin-receptor-like signalling pathway. The sequence of DAF-18 predicts a protein of 962 amino acids, displaying 38% sequence identity to the mammalian PTEN phosphatase domain. The amino acids comprising the Cys(X)5Arg motif are 90% identical, including the invariant spacing of the basic residues within the active site (Fig. 1c). The genetic analysis and sequence identity surrounding the active site raise the distinct possibility that DAF-18 is a phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase that normally limits AKT-1/AKT-2 activation in the worm by decreasing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels. These observations suggest that DAF-18 regulates a metabolic pathway in the worm similar to the insulin signalling pathway in mammals. Whether PTEN modulates mammalian insulin signalling pathways and/or whether PTEN mutations affect other metabolic pathways are interesting questions for exploration. How is PTEN regulated? Although this is a very important question, there is almost no information on PTEN regulation aside from the fact that PTEN mRNA levels are modulated by transforming growth factor 28. In addition to control of the transcriptional activity of the gene

encoding PTEN, it is likely that the subcellular location of the phosphatase is carefully modulated. It might be anticipated that the cell employs an organization centre or scaffold to generate local concentrations of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as a result of PI3K activation, which in turn regulates specific proteins in the cell such as AKT/PKB. As there are many proteins that are regulated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding (Vav, PKC, PLC , Btk, etc.), there must also be a strategy to limit the biological actions of this membrane-diffusible lipid18,29­32. It is interesting to note that all mammalian PTENs have a PDZ-binding domain at their C-termini. Human PTEN interacts with the protein MUPP1 (AF093419), which contains ten PDZ domains (Y. Zhao and J. E. Dixon, unpublished). This, or other organizational strategies, might be employed by the cell to generate and localize the effect of diffusible second messengers such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. References
