The pH dependence of steady-state parameters for aldehyde reduction and alcohol oxidation were determined in the human liver aldehyde reductase reaction. The maximum velocity of aldehyde reduction with NADPH or 3-acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (3APADPH) was pH independent at low pH but decreased at high pH with a pK of 8.9-9.6. The V/K for both nucleotides decreased below a pK of 5.7-6.2, as did the pKi of competitive inhibitors NADP and ATP-ribose, suggesting that the 2'-phosphate of the nucleotide has to be deprotonated for binding to the enzyme. The pK of the 2'-phosphate of NADPH appears to be perturbed in the ternary complexes to 5.2-5.4. The V/K for NADPH, the and the pKi of ATP-ribose also deV/K for 3-APADPH, creased above a pK of 9-10, suggesting interaction of the 2'-phosphate of the nucleotide with a protonated base, perhaps lysine. Since protonation of a residue with a pK of 8 (evident in V/K for DL-glyceraldehyde and V/K for L-gulonate versus pH profiles) appears to be essential for aldehyde reduction, and deprotonation for alcohol oxidation, this residue appears to act as a general acid-base catalyst. An additional anion binding site with a pK of 9.94 facilitates the binding of carboxylic substrates such as D-ghcUrOnate. With NADPH as the coenzyme the primary deuterium isotope effects on V and V/K for NADPH were close to unity and pH independent, suggesting that the hydride transfer step is not rate determining over the experimental pH range. With 3-APADPH as the coenzyme, the maximum velocity, relative to NADPH was three- to four-fold lower. Isotope effects on V, V/K for 3-APADPH, and V/K for D-glucuronate were pH independent and equal to 2.2-2.8, indicating that the chemical step of the reaction is relatively insensitive to pH. These data suggest that substrates bind to both the protonated and the deprotonated forms of the enzyme, though only the protonated enzyme catalyzes aldehyde reduction and the deprotonated enzyme catalyzes alcohol oxidation. On the basis of these results a scheme for the chemical mechanism of aldehyde reductase is postulated.

Aldehyde reductase (Alcohol:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.2) catalyzes NADPH-mediated reduction of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols (l-3). The enzyme has been proposed to catalyze the reduction of fl-hydroxylated biogenic aldehydes derived from oxidative deamination of neurotransmitter biogenic amines (4) and D-glucuronate, mevaldate, or succinic semialdehyde (5, 6). The ability of this enzyme to reduce ketones such as daunorubicin (7), a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, suggests that the enzyme may play an important role in detoxification of carbonyl compounds. However, neither the in uiuo substrate of the enzyme nor its physiological function has been clearly identified, partly due to the paucity of data on the kinetic and structural properties of the enzyme. Aldehyde reductase is closely related to aldose reductase and although the two enzymes follow different reaction schemes (8), they catalyze similar reactions (2, 3). Both these enzymes are monomeric and have comparable sensitivities to most synthetic aldose reductase inhibitors (9)) which have been shown to attenuate or reverse some secondary complications of diabetes mellitus (10). Elucidation of the reaction mechanisms of both these enzymes will be useful not only in understanding their roles in aldehyde metabolism, but also in the synthesis of specific inhibitors. Although the amino acid sequence of the human placental aldehyde reductase has been published (ll), the active site of the enzyme has not yet been characterized. Chemical modification studies suggest the presence of reactive arginine (la), lysine (13), and histidine (14) residues at or near the active site. Our data on the pH dependence of steady-state kinetic parameters are consistent with an ionic interaction between NADP(H) and active site lysine and a histidine acting as an acid-base residue, with ar-

Initial velocity profiles showing linear competitive and linear uncompetitive substrate inhibition were fitted to Eqs. [2] and [3] (21, 22), respectively, u = VeA.B/{(K,,*K,(l u = V.A.B/{(K,,.K, + B/K,,) + K,J + K,B(l + B/K,& + AB}, + K,B + K,A + AB + (AB*/K,&}. [2] [31

NADPH, NADP, ATP-ribose, 3-acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (3.APADP), and D-ghicuronate were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. D-Gulonic acid y-lactone and menadione bisulfide were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Human liver was obtained within 24 h postmortem. Aldehyde reductase was purified to homogeneity as described earlier (16). The homogeneity of the enzyme was evidenced by the appearance of a single protein band corresponding to a molecular weight of 36,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfateepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the appearance of a single protein peak coincident with the enzyme activity through Sephadex G100 gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the rate of disappearance (for aldehyde reduction) or the rate of appearance (for alcohol oxidation) of NADPH at 340 nm using a Gilford recording spectrophotometer Response. The reaction temperature was maintained at 37°C with a circulating waterbath. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce or oxidize 1 aM NADP(H) per minute. The assay mixture containing all the components of the reaction mixture, except the aldehyde or alcohol substrate, served as the blank.
Preparation of 4R-4D-NADPD. NADPH and NADPD were synthesized using a modified version of the method of Viola et al. (17). The reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 10 ml, 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.8, 2 mM NADP, 6 mM isopropyl alcohol (H-8 or d-8), 20 units of (NADP)-alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobium brockii, and 5 mM DTT. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 min at 4O"C, while the appearance of the reduced nucleotide was constantly monitored at 340 nm. Reduced and oxidized nucleotides were separated using an AGM P-l anion exchange column and then desalted on a Bioof Gel P-2 column. The A260/A3.,0 ratio of the final preparation NADP(H,D) was 2.2, indicating the absence of contaminating oxidized coenzyme. The nucleotide analog 3-APADPH was synthesized from commercially available 3-APADP by a method similar to that used for the synthesis of NADPH. The A26U/A361 ratio of the final preparation of 3-APADP(H,D) was 1.7. pH studies. To avoid changes in the composition of the buffer and the ionic strength of the reaction mixture on varying pH, a three-buffer system was chosen, which consisted of 50 mM B[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 100 mM imidazole, and 50 mM glycylglycine. The pK values of these buffers at the ionic strength used (0.125 M) and the amount of salt needed to keep the ionic strength constant throughout the experimental pH range were computed as described by Ellis and Morrison (18). No significant change was observed in the enzyme activity after extensive dialysis against this buffer at pH `7.0. Neither NADPH nor D-ghicuronate was found to react with any component of the buffer system. D-glucuronate (pK 3.12) (19) does not ionize in the experimental pH range. The upper limit of the substrate concentration used for obtaining initial velocity patterns was at least two- to threefold higher than the Km value of that particular substrate at that pH. For stability studies, the enzyme was preincubated with the threebuffer system at different pH for 10 min and the enzyme activity was determined at pH 7.0. Irreversible loss of activity occurred only upon incubation with the buffer system at pH > 11 and < 5. No significant loss of enzyme activity was observed at pH 5-10.5. Even so, when assaying for enzyme activity at different pH, the enzyme was stored at pH 7.0 and was added last to the reaction mixture (pH-jump technique). No significant difference was observed in the pH of the reaction mixture measured at the beginning and after 5 min of the reaction. Data analysis. Individual saturation curves used to obtain V and K and data conforming to linear competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition were fitted according to Cleland (20). Data conforming to a sequential initial velocity pattern were fitted to Eq. [ 11,

Initial velocities obtained with varying concentrations of the aldehyde substrates at saturating concentrations of NADPH(D) and with varying concentrations of NADPH(D) at a fixed concentration of the aldehyde were fitted using the following equations, respectively (8),

Eqs. [4] and [5] assume independent isotope effects on V and V/K or equal effects on V and V/K, respectively. F, is the fraction of the deuterium label on the substrate, while, Ev, E,,, and E, are isotope effects minus 1 for the respective parameters. Data for pH profiles showing a decrease in log V, log V/K, or pK, with a slope of 1 as pH was lowered or a slope of ~1 as pH was raised were fitted to Eqs. [6] and [7], respectively (20), log Y = log[c/(l log Y = log[c/(l + H/pK)], + pK/H)].

In these expressions K, and Kb are the dissociation constants for the group on the enzyme, Y is the value of the observed parameter, and c is the pH-independent value of Y. In all cases the best fit to the data was chosen on the basis of the standard error of the fitted parameter and the lowest value of 0, which is defined as the sum of the squares of the residuals divided by the degrees of freedom (number of observations minus the number of parameters calculated).

RESULTS

The initial velocity profiles with D-glucuronate (Fig. la) and with NADPH (Fig. lb) as the varied substrate are presented. Substantial substrate inhibition was evident at low concentrations of NADPH and high concentrations of Dglucuronate (Fig. la). However, at high concentrations of NADPH and low concentrations of D-glucuronate the plots are linear over the concentration range used. A fit of the data to Eq. [l] resulted in a small value of IJ (1.5 X lo-") which was significantly reduced when the data were fitted to Eq. [2] (3.04 X 10m5), whereas for Eq. [3] the value of u was intermediate (4.20 X 10p4), indicating that the observed substrate inhibition could be best described as competitive.

FIG. 1. Double reciprocal initial velocity plots of D-glucuronate reduction catalyzed by human liver aldehyde reductase. The catalytic activity was determined at pH `7.0 using a composite buffer system as described under Materials and Methods.

The values of the kinetic constants used to generate the best fit lines were V = 0.406 U and, in mM, K,, = 0.0079, K, = 0.001 Kb = 8.123, Kih = 7.71.

were nonlinear, whereas the intercept replots were linear (figure not shown); an observation consistent with competitive substrate inhibition. To determine the reaction scheme, the product inhibition profiles and the inhibition profiles by dead-end inhibitors were studied. At pH 7.0, with NADPH as the variable substrate NADP was comof D-glucpetitive at both high and low concentrations uronate (K, = 0.03 k 0.005 mM). NADP was a noncompetitive inhibitor versus D-glucuronate (Ki, = 0.87 + 0.09 mM, K,, = 0.37 k 0.05 mM, at NADPH = 0.06 mM). The product L-gulonate was uncompetitive versus NADPH at saturating concentrations of D-glucuronate (K,, = 188 -t 26 mM) and noncompetitive versus D-glucuronate at saturating concentrations of NADPH (K,,> = 91.9 + 18.1 mM and K,, = 148 * 7.1 mM). Furthermore, menadione, which is a compet,itive inhibitor versus D-glucuronate (K, = 0.58 + 0.04 mM), was an uncompetitive inhibitor vs NADPH (Kji = 1.51 + 0.20 mM) at 5.0 mM D-glucuronate, and ATP-ribose, which is a competitive inhibitor versus NADPH (K,, = 0.37 + 0.04 mM), was noncompetitive versus D-glucuronate at 0.05 mM NADPH (K,, = 0.56 rt 0.06 and Ki; = 0.34 +- 0.04 mM). All the product and dead-end inhibition patterns are consistent with an ordered addition of substrates and an ordered release of products with NADPH and NADP binding to the free enzyme. The pHindependent values of the steady-state kinetic parameters of the enzyme are shown in Table I. The maximum velocity was pH dependent and decreased at high pH with a pK of 8.94 f 0.03 when NADPH and D-glucuronate were used as substrates, and with a pK of 9.60 f 0.16 when 3-APADPH and D-glucuronate were used as substrates (Fig. 2). The V/K for NADPH decreased below a pK of 5.77 ? 0.15. The V/K for 3APADPH, which is an analog of the coenzyme, decreased below a pK of 6.18 + 0.06. The V/K for both the nucleotides decreased at high pH with a pK value of 9.05 +- 0.12

for NADPH and 10.23 + 0.09 for 3-APADPH. The V/K for the aldehyde substrate displayed a bell-shaped dependence on pH. The V/K for D-glucuronate decreased below a pK of 5.44 & 0.07 and above a pK of 9.94 + 0.07, whereas V/K for DL-glyceraldehyde, which is a poorer substrate for the enzyme than D-glucuronate, decreased below a pK of 5.25 4 0.57 and above a pK of 7.92 + 0.06. The pHindependent values of these parameters are shown in Table I.

FIG. 2. pH dependence of the steady-state kinetic parameters for aldehyde reduction. Values of V, V/K for NADPH, and V/K for D-glucuronate were determined from complete initial velocity plots using Eq. [l] at pH 7.5-10.0 and Eq. [2] at pH 5.0-7.0. The values of V/K for 3-APADPH were determined at 15 mM D-glucuronate and the values of V/K for DL-glyceraldehyde was determined at 0.1 mM NADPH. The points shown are experimentally determined values, while the curves are from a fit of the data to Eq. [7] for V and Eq. [8] for V/K plots. The pH-independent values of these parameters are given in Table I and the calculated pK values are given in Table III.

The Ki values of inhibitors competitive against each of the reactants were also pH dependent (Fig. 3). The pK& of NADP, which is a product of the forward reaction, decreased below a pK of 6.59 + 0.36. At higher pH values (>7.0) the pKi for NADP was pH independent. The pKi for ATP-ribose, which is an analog of NADP, decreased at both high and low pH values, with pK values of 6.46 + 0.03 and 9.39 t 0.04. Menadione bisulfide, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme versus the aldehyde substrate, displayed a single pK of 6.85 + 0.04. It is important to point out that the inhibition patterns of NADP, ATPribose, and menadione bisulfide did not change with pH. NADP and ATP-ribose displayed competitive inhibition versus NADPH and menadione bisulfide was a competitive inhibitor versus D-glucuronate over the experimental pH range. Table II lists the primary isotope deuterium isotope effects determined at pH 5.5, 7.0, and 9.8 either with NADP(H,D) or with 3-APADP(H,D) as the coenzyme. A small isotope effect on V (with NADPH) at these pH values indicates that hydride transfer is not rate limiting

(23). Isotope effects on V/K NADPH were close to unity at the pH values studied, confirming a steady-state bibi-ordered reaction scheme. Deuterium isotope effects determined using 3-APADP(H,D) are also listed in Table II. The maximal velocity obtained with 3-APADPH was four- to fivefold lower than that obtained with NADPH. Significant isotope effects were obtained on V with 3APADPH as the coenzyme. Isotope effects obtained on V/K for 3-APADPH and V/K for D-glucuronate were similar and equal to those obtained on V, suggesting a rapid equilibrium-ordered reaction scheme.

In each case the inhibition profile of the inhibitor was competitive versus the varied substrate.

evident at high concentrations of L-gulonate and at low concentrations of NADP. Double reciprocal plots of the initial velocities versus NADP do not converge at one point, suggesting competitive substrate inhibition (data not shown). Indeed, data were best fitted by the rate equation for competitive substrate inhibition (Eq. [3], u = 7 X lo-"), than those for uncompetitive inhibition (Eq.

DISCUSSION Protonation mechanism. The kinetic parameters of aldehyde reductase show a marked dependence on pH. At low pH values substantial substrate inhibition was observed," but calculation of the uninhibited reaction ve" Cleland (24) has pointed out that one of the most frequent reasons for substrate inhibition is the formation of an abortive complex between the enzyme and the substrate. Such complexes result in uncompetitive substrate inhibition. However, inhibition of aldehyde reductase by Dglucuronate is competitive because in spite of inhibition by D-glucuronate the intercept at the ordinate of the double reciprocal plot (Fig. la) decreased as D-glucuronate concentration was increased. Also, an increase in D-glucuronate concentration always resulted in an apparent increase in V, ruling out noncompetitive substrate inhibition. The inhibition observed could not be accounted for by a possible contamination in the commercial preparations of D-glucuronate. The concentration of this contaminant in the assay buffer would be expected to increase if high concentrations of p-glucuronate are used and the observed substrate inhibition would not be expected to be a function of NADPH concentration. As shown in Fig. la inhibition of the enzyme activity decreased with an increase in NADPH. If the contaminant was NADPH-like, a greater inhibition would be expected at high concentrations of NADPH. Data presented in Fig. la show that inhibition of the enzyme was much less at high concentrations of NADPH.

The observed isotope effect on V was insensitive to changes in the pH, indicating that even though the reaction velocity is considerably affected, hydride transfer does not become rate limiting.

Note. The compounds in parenthesis are the substrates used to determine the V or the nonvaried substrate used to determine V/K of the varied substrate. The pK values were calculated using Eqs. [6-81 and are expressed as means t standard error. For estimation of each pK value the values of the kinetic parameters were estimated at 7-11 different pH values.

may be liable to large errors, the isotope effects were increased by using an NADPH analog, 3-ADADP(H,D), which is oxidized at much slower rates than NADP(H,D). With 3-APADPH as the nucleotide substrate, the reaction velocity was considerably reduced and the corresponding isotope effects were twice that obtained with NADPH. Nevertheless, the increased isotope effects obtained with 3-ADPDPH were also insensitive to the protonation state of the enzyme. According to the theory developed by Cook and Cleland (25) on the pH dependence of isotope effects, it appears that the protonated as well as the deprotonated form of the enzyme can bind substrates, but only the protonated form of the enzyme is capable of catalyzing aldehyde reduction. Assignment of pK values. There are four distinct pK values that are being titrated over the experimental pH range. The pK value that could be assigned with least ambiguity is that observed in pH profiles of V/K for NADPH, V/K for 3-APADPH, K, of ATP-ribose and Ki of NADP. This pK (5.8-6.6) is probably due to the ionization of the 2'-phosphate of NADP(H) ribose and is absent in the log V versus pH profile, which is expected if only deprotonated NADPH binds to the enzyme. The pK, observed in V/K for DL-glyceraldehyde and D-glucuronate may also be due to the 2'-phosphate of NADPH, although it appears that in the E:NADPH:aldehyde ternary complex this pK is shifted to lower pH values. Titration of the 2'-phosphate of free NADPH or free ATPribose yields pK values of 6.52 + 0.03 and 6.36 -t 0.02, respectively (26), which is well within experimental error of the pK values estimated in this study. An ionic binding interaction between 2'-phosphate of NADP(H) and aldehyde reductase is in contrast to other pyridine nucleotide coenzyme linked oxidoreductases such as glutathione reductase (27) and dihydrofolate reductase (28), in which

V/K NADPH or V/K ATP-ribose are pH independent in the pH range where their 2'-phosphate would titrate. The pK values of 7.92 seen in the direction of aldehyde reduction (V/K for DL-glyceraldehyde vs pH profile), and of 8.01 in the direction of alcohol reduction (V/K for Lgulonate vs pH profile) appear to be due to the titration of the same residue. Because the pK of this group is apparently the same in E:NADP and E:NADPH binary complexes, the residue is not located close enough to the NADP(H) binding site to be perturbed by the positive charge on Nl of NADP. This group has to be protonated for aldehyde reduction and deprotonated for alcohol oxidation and thus acts as a general acid-base catalyst, which may function as a proton shuttle between the substrate and the enzyme depending on the pH and the direction of the reaction. It is likely that this group is a histidine residue. We had reported earlier that carbethoxylation of the enzyme by diethylpyrocarbonate resulted in inactivation of the enzyme with concomitant modification of a single histidine residue (14). Free histidine has a pK of 6-7 (19), although values of histidine pK of around 8.0 have been reported (29). The inactivation of the human kidney aldehyde reductase by diethylpyrocarbonate shows a pK of 6.8. In the IfreverSe pH profile the pK of vs `i-7.5 also appears to be due to histidine. It should be pointed out that the reverse reaction of aldehyde reductase is considerably slower than the forward reaction so that t,he portion of the mechanism containing the hydride transfer step is largely rate limiting and thus V is sensitive to steps included in V/K. The pK of the acid-base catalyst, therefore, does not affect Vfonvardbut only the V/Kfomard profile for I>L-glyceraldehyde, whereas both VIeverSe and VIKrewrse for L-gulonate show similar pK values. The pKb evident in the pH profile of V/K glyceraldehyde is perturbed in V/K D-glucuronate. D-Glucuronate is a better substrate for the enzyme than DL-glyceraldehyde. A shift in pK with D-glucuronate indicates that this substrate may be "sticky," that is, it dissociates less rapidly from the ternary complex than it reacts to form products (23). The shift in the pK of V/K for glucuronate could be due to additional binding of the carboxylic aldehyde to an alkaline group that must be protonated for binding. This anion binding site is likely to be an arginine. On the basis of the observation that inactivation sfl the !

enzyme by p-carboxyphenyl glyoxal could be prevented byp-carboxybenzaldehyde it has been suggested (30) that the active site of the enzyme contains an anion binding site which selectively binds carboxylic substrates. The difference in the pK observed with carboxylic (D-ghcuronate) and noncarboxylic (DL-glyceraldehyde) substrates observed in this study is entirely consistent with the postulated anion binding site at the active site of the enzyme. The residue with a pK of 8.6 to 9.6 apparent in the log V of aldehyde reduction versus pH profile does not appear to be a catalytic group. However, this group has to be protonated for binding. This may be the same residue that is evident in V/K for NADPH, V/K for 3-APADPH, and V/K for ATP-ribose. In the case of VIeverSe pK of the this group is perturbed and appears near 10.22. Surprisingly, this residue does not appear in the PKi NADP profile, perhaps because in the E:NADP binary complex this residue is located near the nicotinamide ring which shifts the pK to a higher pH value (>ll). Such a shift in the pK of this residue would be consistent with the observation that V/K for 3-APADP does not decrease at pH values less than 11. Since this group is extremely alkaline, of aldehyde reit may be a lysine residue. Modification ductase with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate has been shown to result in almost complete inactivation of the enzyme and the inactivated enzyme does not bind NADPH as shown by equilibrium binding dialysis and fluorescence spectroscopy (13). On the basis of these observations, it has been suggested that NADPH binds directly to the active site lysine via the pyrophosphate bridge (13). A lysine residue (Lys-228) has also been suggested to bind to the 2'-phosphate of NADP(H) at the active site of aldose reductase (31). Moreover, the amino acid sequence around lysine-228 is conserved in both aldose and aldehyde reductases, which share more than 60% sequence homology (11). It is, therefore, likely that the NADP(H) binding sites of the two enzymes are similar and the lysine residue of aldehyde reductase also binds to the 2'-phosphate rather than the pyrophosphate bridge. However, the substrate binding sites of the two enzymes appear to be different, as modification of arginine (32) or histidine (33) does not affect aldose reductase activity. Also, unlike aldehyde reductase, aldose reductase is very sensitive to thiol oxidat?on and two essential cysteine residues have been pos-

tulated to be present at or near the active site (33, 34). Such differences in the substrate binding groups of the two enzymes suggest that the two enzymes employ different strategies for catalysis of carbonyl reduction. Therefore, at least in principle, these differences could be exploited to design selective inhibitors for aldehyde or aldose reductase. On the basis of the above results a model of the active site of human liver aldehyde reductase is presented in Fig. 6. The carbonyl of the aldehyde substrate is hydrogen bonded to a protonated histidine residue. A protonated arginine is required to bind to the carboxylate of dicarbony1 substrates such as D-glucuronate. The adjacent positively charged histidine tends to polarize the carbonyl, facilitating hydride transfer. The positive charge on Nl of the oxidized coenzyme generated will tend to repel the positively charged arginine, causing an opening of the active site to release products. It must be emphasized that the schematic representation of the active site of aldehyde reductase is largely hypothetical, although it is consistent with the data presented here and with the results of other investigations on aldehyde reductase. A confirmation of this model must await X-ray crystallographic investigations of the enzyme. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
