Abstract--The proteolytic enzyme b-secretase (BACE-1) produces amyloid b (Ab) peptide, the primary constituent of neurofibrillary plaques, implicated in Alzheimer's disease, by cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. A small molecule inhibitor of BACE-1, (diaminomethylene)-2,5-diphenyl-1H-pyrrole-1-acetamide (1, BACE-1 IC50 = 3.7 lM), was recently described, representing a new small molecule lead. Initial SAR investigation demonstrated the potential of accessing the nearby S3 and S01 substrate binding pockets of the BACE-1 enzyme by building substituents off one of the phenyl substituents and guanidinyl functional group. We report here the optimization of guanidinyl functional group substituents on 1, leading to potent submicromolar BACE-1 inhibitors. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of neuritic plaques on the outside of nerve cells in areas of the brain related to memory. These plaques consist predominantly of the abnormal peptide b-amyloid (Ab), a protein fragment cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP), during metabolism.1 Although neuropathologic and epidemiological studies are inconclusive as to the pathogenic role of Ab in Alzheimer's disease, studies from many laboratories support the hypothesis that amyloid production plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.2,3 As a consequence of the widespread acceptance of this hypothesis, vigorous efforts in compound screening and medicinal chemistry have been undertaken to find inhibitors of

the two proteases, b- and c-secretase, responsible for Ab production. b-Secretase (BACE-1, Beta Amyloid Cleaving Enzyme 1, also called memapsin 2 and Asp-2) is a membrane-anchored aspartyl protease and a member of the pepsin sub-family of aspartyl proteases. BACE-1 mediates the primary cleavage of APP at residue 671, generating the membrane-bound C-terminal APP fragment C99, which is in turn cleaved by c-secretase, liberating Ab.1,4­6 Peptide-like inhibitors of BACE-1, based on substrate mimicry, have been disclosed7 and reviewed.8 Recently, publications disclosing small molecule BACE-1 inhibitors have started to appear.9 We have recently disclosed the acylguanidine 1 as an inhibitor of BACE-1 with low micromolar affinity (BACE-1 IC50 = 3.7 lM, Kd = 2.8 lM) and the key structural features of the enzyme/inhibitor complex, as revealed by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1).10 An initial round of SAR investigation using

parallel synthesis revealed the opportunity to increase binding potency by adding substituents to the para-position of one of the phenyl groups of 1 extending into the S3 substrate binding pocket. Improved BACE-1 inhibitor 2 was the outcome of this effort.11 Molecular modeling also revealed the potential for adding substituents to the guanidinyl functional group of 1 extending into the S01 pocket, which is occupied by an Asp side chain of the natural substrate. Inhibitors with substituents extending into the S01 pocket could take advantage of differences in the size and relative hydrophobicity in the S01 sites of different aspartyl proteases to enhance selectivity for BACE-1 over cathepsin D and renin. Peptide mimetic inhibitors of BACE-1 variously do or do not have substituents directed toward the S01 pocket.8 Stachel9a and Garino9b have separately reported nonpeptidic BACE-1 inhibitors which have substituents that extend into the S01 pocket, resulting in improved selectivity and potency. We report here the results of our investigation of different substituent groups extending off the guanidinyl group of 1. Disubstituted guanidines were synthesized by a number of different routes. In all cases, disubstituted pyrrole intermediates 6 were prepared following our previously disclosed route.10 Early on, the substituted acyl guanidines were prepared by a protection­deprotection sequence using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. Alkylation of the Boc-protected intermediate was carried out using sodium hydride and was followed by acid mediated deprotection (Scheme 1). Subsequently, a more convenient synthetic procedure was developed allowing the use of amines as building blocks for side-chain synthesis (Scheme 2).12 Intermediate 6 was reacted with carbonyl diimidazole and pyrazole-1-carboxamidine hydrochloride to afford the iminopyrazole intermediate 9. The pyrazole could be easily displaced by amines to afford the alkyl substituted acyl guanidines. Alkyl ureido guanidines 11 could be prepared from the Boc-protected acyl guanidine 7 by reaction with amines in DMSO.

was approximately as potent as the initial lead. An X-ray crystal structure of the inhibitor bound to BACE-1 clearly showed that the trifluorophenyl substituent was accommodated into the S01 substrate binding pocket. This was almost certainly a sub-optimal pairing of substituent group with the binding pocket because (1) the S01 pocket, where the Arg235 and Thr329 residues form part of the pocket wall, was expected to better accommodate polar substituent groups, (2) the volume of the 2,3,4trifluorobenzyl group was a bit large for the S01 pocket and, as a consequence, (3) docking experiments indicated that the benzylic linkage of the bound molecule was somewhat strained. Acting on this hypothesis, a library of analogs was prepared to investigate the effect on binding and selectivity of different S01 substituents (Table 1). Substituent groups were selected (based on docking) for size and polarity complimentarity with the S01 pocket. All of the analogs made showed a significant (2­9·) boost in potency of BACE-1 inhibition relative to 2. In order to avoid toxicities caused by inhibition of off-target proteases, selectivity of inhibitors for BACE-1 over other aspartyl proteases was a goal of this project. All compounds were evaluated for inhibition of cathepsin D in a FRET assay. Compounds with polar substituents, whether having a cyclic (e.g. 14 and 15) or an acyclic (e.g. 16­25) connection to the guanidinyl group, showed high levels of BACE-1/ cathepsin D selectivity, whereas analogs with aromatic substituent groups (e.g. 26­29), while potent, showed poor selectivity. Reduction of Ab production in CHO cells recombinantly expressing human wild-type APP10 improved 5-fold in some examples (ED50 2 = 5.9 lM, LD50 2 > 25 lM). An analogous SAR study was done using the adamantyl substituted acyl guanidine inhibitor 4 as a scaffold (Table 2). Addition of S01 substituents gave a measurable boost to BACE-1 inhibition potency. Substituent groups

of sufficient length with hydroxy and cyano groups on the terminus were preferred. Aromatic substituent groups also gave potent inhibitors of BACE-1, although BACE-1/cathepsin D selectivity was diminished. ED50 for Ab production improved in certain examples (31, 38, and 45) but did not appear to correlate with improving IC50 for BACE-1 inhibition. Compounds were generally not toxic to cells (LD50) at doses near the ED50. Compounds with aromatic S01 substituents (41­45) were exceptional in this regard, suggesting that decreased selectivity was associated with increased toxicity. Acyl guanidines with alkyl carbamoyl or alkylsulfonyl substituent groups (not shown in tables) did not inhibit BACE-1 to any appreciable extent at the tested concentrations. The complex of inhibitor 31 with BACE-1 was crystallized and the resulting crystal structure was diffracted and solved.10 As anticipated, the N-3-hydroxypropyl group extends into the S01 pocket with little strain, although not displacing tightly held water molecules from the pocket (Fig. 2). These tightly held water molecules effectively become part of the protein with the inhibitor making hydrogen bonding interactions through them. Acyl guanidines substituted with alkyl groups on the guanidine nitrogen provided an improvement in potency of BACE-1 inhibition. A subset of these analogs, particularly aliphatic substituents with polar groups at the end of the chain, exhibited promising levels of selectivity for BACE-1 over cathepsin D, and activity approaching 1 lM in the cellular Ab lowering assay. Compounds in this series for which absorption in the Caco-2 drug transport model13 was assessed (4, 30, and 31) were found to have poor permeability. The guanidinyl functionality, while involved in important hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic aspartic acid residues in the catalytic site, may be responsible for the poor permeability that characterizes

this series. However, an understanding of the effects of occupation of available substrate binding pockets and a demonstration of the ability of analogs to exploit available protein functionality in the substrate binding pockets for increased BACE-1 potency is an important first step toward the goal of optimizing the lead for oral bioavailability, CNS penetration, and a suitable duration of action. Future publications from these laboratories will disclose the results of further functionalization of the guanidine group and its replacement with bioisosteres. References and notes
