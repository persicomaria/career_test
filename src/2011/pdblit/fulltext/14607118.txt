CnfU, a key iron­sulfur (Fe­S) cluster biosynthetic scaffold that is required for biogenesis of ferredoxin and photosystem I in chloroplasts, consists of two tandemly repeated domains in which only the N-terminal domain contains a conserved CXXC motif. We have determined the crystal structure of the metal-free dimer of AtCnfU-V from Arabidopsis thaliana at 1.35 Å resolution. The N-terminal domains of the two monomers are linked together through two intermolecular disulfide bonds between the CXXC motifs. At the dimer interface, a total of four cysteine sulfur atoms provide a Fe­S cluster assembly site surrounded by uncharged but hydrophilic structurally mobile segments. The C-terminal domain of one monomer interacts with the N-terminal domain of the opposing monomer and thereby stabilizes dimer formation. Furthermore, Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic analysis of the holo-CnfU dimer in solution suggests the presence of a typical [2Fe­2S]-type cluster coordinated by four thiolate ligands. Based on these data, a plausible model of the holo-AtCnfU-V dimer containing a surface-exposed [2Fe­2S] cluster assembled in the dimer interface was deduced. We propose that such a structural framework is important for CnfU to function as a Fe­S cluster biosynthetic scaffold.

Introduction
Iron­sulfur (Fe­S)-cluster-containing proteins are involved in a variety of metabolic processes in various organisms.1,2 Recent studies have revealed the involvement of multiple protein factors in the process of Fe­S cluster biosynthesis, with several distinct molecular mechanisms that diverged among different organisms.3­5 Regardless of the distinct mechanisms, it is common knowledge that key proteins are cysteine desulfurases, namely, NifS, IscS, and Nfs1,

which provide sulfane sulfur atoms for Fe­S cluster assembly, and the so-called scaffold proteins, such as NifU, IscU, IscA, and CnfU.5,6 On the scaffold proteins, Fe­S clusters are transiently assembled, and the preassembled Fe­S clusters are delivered to various substrate apoproteins.6 These different scaffold proteins vary in their amino acid sequences, but possess two or three invariant Cys residues that are specific for each scaffold protein. Which scaffold protein has been evolutionarily selected and predominantly utilized in one organism presumably depends on the respective intracellular environment where the Fe­S clusters are biosynthesized (e.g., NifU and IscU function under anaerobic and oxygen-consuming microanoxic cellular environments, respectively).5,6 In this context, plant chloroplasts and cyanobacterial cells possess unique intracellular environments because they perform oxygen-evolving photosynthesis and because Fe­S clusters are considerably sensitive to exposure to oxygen. Most extant cyanobacterial genomes encode one scaffold protein termed CnfU, which is essential for cell viability.6­8 The cyanobacterial CnfU is about 76 amino acids long,

carries two evolutionarily invariant Cys residues in the CXXC motif, and shows overall sequence similarity to the C-terminal third of NifU found in nitrogen-fixing bacteria and to the C-terminal portion of Nfu found in eukaryotic mitochondria, both of which were demonstrated to have an ability to bind a [4Fe­ 4S]-type cluster upon reconstitution under anaerobic conditions in vitro.9,10 The cyanobacterial CnfU is the first Fe­S cluster biosynthetic scaffold whose ability to transfer its bound Fe­S cluster to an apo substrate was demonstrated in vitro.7 Plant chloroplasts have inherited homologs of the key scaffold protein of cyanobacterial origin. Arabidopsis chloroplasts contain three CnfU homologues, termed AtCnfU-V, AtCnfU-IVa, and AtCnfU-IVb, all of which consist of two tandemly repeated cyanobacterial CnfU domains.11 Interestingly, only the N-terminal domain of all AtCnfU proteins possesses the conserved CXXC motif, whereas the C-terminal domain lacks the motif. We have previously demonstrated that AtCnfU-V was actually involved in Fe­S cluster biosynthesis in chloroplasts as a scaffold and was thereby required for biogenesis of both ferredoxin and photosystem I.11,12 In this study, we report the crystal structure of the dimeric apo form of AtCnfU-V at 1.35 Å resolution that reveals how the conserved CXXC motif provides a Fe­S cluster assembly site and how the Cterminal domain stabilizes the dimeric configuration. In addition, we carried out Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic analysis with the holoAtCnfU-V dimer to obtain information on the coordination environment of the Fe­S cluster actually assembled on the AtCnfU-V dimer. On the basis of the dimeric apo-AtCnfU-V structure, together with the structure of the [2Fe­2S] cluster assembled on the holo-AtCnfU-V dimer, implications for the function of CnfU-type Fe­S cluster biosynthetic scaffold will be discussed.

Results
Overall structure of AtCnfU-V In the crystallization solution that had been prepared with the purified holo-AtCnfU-V protein, we obtained colorless protein crystals. Data were collected under cryogenic conditions at 100 K. Initial phases were determined by the single isomorphous replacement method with anomalous scattering, using the intensity data of native crystals at 1.6 Å resolution and of platinum derivative crystals at 2.0 Å resolution (Table 1). An initial model was built using the program ARP/wARP.13 The structure was refined with the intensity data of native crystals at 1.35 Å resolution to an R-factor of 13.4%, with a free R-factor of 17.3%. All of the 154 amino acid residues could be assigned to electron density maps; however, no electron density corresponding to a Fe­S cluster was observed. While the crystals contained one AtCnfU-V monomer per asymmetric unit (Fig. 1a), the 2|Fo| - |Fc| map indicates the existence of a homo dimer related

by a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry (monomers A and B) in which two intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed between two conserved cysteine residues, C45(A)­C48(B) and C45(B)­C48(A) (residue numbers are given from the methionine added at the N-terminus of the deduced mature protein consisting of V2-I154) (Figs. 1b and c and 2). As described above, protein crystals were grown in the crystallization solution initially containing the holoAtCnfU-V dimer. The solution retained some pinkred color even after the colorless crystals had been obtained, indicating that a fraction of proteins whose bound Fe­S cluster had been lost in the crystallization solution predominantly formed the colorless crystals. Since this kind of crystal was obtained only from the holodimeric form--but not from the apomonomeric form--in the same crystallization conditions, the bound Fe­S cluster was likely lost from the holo-AtCnfU-V dimer by oxidation in the crystallization solution, followed by inevitable immediate disulfide bond formation between the two most proximal cysteine residues. The resulting oxidized apo-AtCnfU-V dimer might have a rigid conformation and, therefore, might be more prone to crystallization. Such disulfide-bridged dimer was actually observed when the stromal extracts were fractionated by gel-filtration chromatography and

Asterisks indicate strongly conserved residues among the CnfU/Nfu protein family.

subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3). Hence, the determined apo dimer structure of AtCnfU-V should be physiologically relevant and closely related to the holo dimer structure. The monomeric structure of apo-AtCnfU-V shows an  +  fold, which consists of five -helices (), four 310 helices (), and six -strands () with the following topologies: [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3] (the Nterminal domain) and [4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6] (the C-terminal domain) (Figs. 1a and 2). The Nterminal and the C-terminal domains are folded as independent entities connected by an extended hydrophilic strand of D78-G82. Secondary and tertiary structures of the N-terminal domain show a high level of similarity to those of the C-terminal domain, except for the conserved motif C45-X46-X47-C48, which is missing in the C-terminal domain. The two conserved cysteine residues are located on 2 (C45) and at the

loop between 2 and 1 (C48), and, therefore, are on the edge of the N-terminal domain, which thus can form a face-to-face interaction site with another Nterminal domain of a neighboring monomer (Fig. 1c). The N- and C-terminal domains of apo-AtCnfU-V show a high level of structural similarity to the N- and C-terminal monomeric fragments of a rice ortholog, OsCnfU, respectively, which were separately determined by NMR very recently.15,16 Structure surrounding the conserved Fe­S cluster binding site Because of the two disulfide bonds, a total of four S atoms of cysteine residues are located in close proximity to each other at the dimer interface (Figs. 1c and 4a), providing a likely Fe­S cluster assembly site.

backbone B-factors from C45 to M53 and from A75 to G82 are 23.32 Å2 and 34.79 Å2, respectively, while the average B-factor for the entire backbone is 15.79 Å2. It is noteworthy that the C45-M53 region, which shows such elevated B-factors, includes the S atoms of conserved cysteine residues, C45 and C48, and the conserved P49-S50-S51 sequence. Especially, P49, S50, and S 51 represent higher backbone B-factors (25.4 Å2, 28.8 Å2, and 24.9 Å2, respectively). Hence, the AtCnfU dimer can form the Fe­S cluster binding site at the dimer interface surrounded by uncharged but hydrophilic structurally mobile segments. Dimer interface

Stromal extracts were prepared from intact chloroplasts as described previously14 and fractionated by gel filtration using Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Hepes­KOH (pH 7.5) and 150 mM KCl. Fractionated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing (a) or nonreducing (b) conditions, followed by immunoblotting with anti-AtCnfU-V antibody. The molecular mass marker proteins used were bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and myoglobin (18 kDa). Note that fractions 4 and 5 contain the CnfU dimer and that an asterisk denotes the position of the disulfide-bridged dimer of CnfU.

among CnfU/Nfu family proteins (Fig. 2), are located around the presumed Fe­S cluster binding site. These conserved regions mostly consist of amino acid residues with relatively short side chains. The D23-G24-G25 sequence of monomer A (or monomer B) forms a loop between its own 1 helix and 1 strand, and is located closely to the side of the S atom of C45(A) [or C45(B)]. On the other hand, two conserved serine side chains in the P49-S50-S51 sequence of monomer A (or monomer B) mostly cover the S atom of C48(A) [or C48(B)]. Consequently, the S atom of C45 is more exposed to solvent than that of C48 (Fig. 4b, left). Uncharged residues, G24, G25, S50, S51, and T52, gather at the periphery of the C45-X-XC48 motif, which leads to the formation of an uncharged polar patch surrounding the likely Fe­S cluster binding site (Fig. 5, top, dotted circle). On the backside, there seems to be no space to access these S atoms (Fig. 4b, right). Interestingly, the backbone B-factors are moderately elevated from C45 to M53, in addition to the A75-G82 loop region connecting the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains (Fig. 4c). The mean scores of

The area of the dimer interaction consists of not only the conserved C45-X-X-C48 motif in which disulfide bonds are formed (site I in Fig. 6a) but also the area between the N-terminal domain (1) of one monomer and the C-terminal domain (4, 2, 3, and 5) of the counterpart (site II in Fig. 6a). The buried surface area in the dimer interface represents 1267 Å2 per monomer in total, which corresponds to 13.8% of the total surface area (9206 Å2 ) per monomer, and 10 hydrogen bonds are formed in the interface. One monomer bears three dimer interfaces: one in site I and two in site II. The buried surface area in site I is 279 Å2, and those in the Nterminal and C-terminal domains of site II are 493 Å2 and 494 Å2, respectively. In site I, in addition to the disulfide bonds, interchain hydrogen bonds formed between S50(A) and S51(B), between S51(A) and S50 (B), and between S51(A) and S51(B) are involved in forming the contact. A total of four intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed in one site II interface: between D14(A) and T104(B), between E15(A) and T132(B), and between M21(A) and Y100(B). In site II, the C-terminal domain interface involves 12 hydrophobic amino acid residues that form a hydrophobic patch (Fig. 6b). Four hydrophobic amino acid residues are involved in the N-terminal domain interface in site II. P18 at 1 of the N-terminal domain, which is invariant among all CnfU/Nfu protein homologues (Fig. 2), is inserted into the hydrophobic pocket formed by the C-terminal domain interface of site II. This hydrophobic interaction in site II likely stabilizes the dimeric structure (Fig. 6b). Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectra indicate the binding of [2Fe­2S] cluster on AtCnfU-V Our attempts to crystallize the holo-AtCnfU-V dimer were unsuccessful, presumably because of the

protein sample showed the same UV/visible absorption spectrum as that of the intact sample, suggesting virtually no damage caused by the X-ray irradiation (data not shown). The general shape of the spectra of the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of holoAtCnfU is quite similar to that of a [2Fe­2S] ferredoxin (Fd I) from Zea mays17 (Fig. 7a). The spectra exhibit a pre-edge at 7112 eV, which is assigned as 1s  3d transition. The total intensities of the peak area were found to be 0.21 eV and 0.22 eV for holoAtCnfU and Fd I, respectively. Since the intensity is highly correlated with a coordination number in the case of high-spin ferric species,18 the values of both samples lay in the expected region for fourcoordinate species. Thus, the subtle differences in the pre-edge features between holo-AtCnfU and Fd I suggest similar four-coordination environments. The weak shoulder around 7117 eV observed in both spectra is consistent with sulfur-coordinated

ferric species.18 Besides the pre-edge, the largest peak around 7130 eV is known to be sensitive to the oxidation state and geometry of the iron atom.19 No significant difference in the position can be seen between holo-AtCnfU and Fd I (Fig. 7a). As the oxidation states of both iron ions in the [2Fe­2S] cluster of Fd I are known to be in ferric states, the Fe­S cluster bound to the AtCnfU-V dimer also can be regarded as ferric species. The observed XANES agrees with the UV/visible absorption spectra that display a characteristic sulfur­ferric charge transfer band at around 450 nm.11 Accordingly, we concluded that the holo-AtCnfU-V dimer has four-coordinate ferric complexes that are similar to the [2Fe­2S] cluster on Fd I. The theoretical simulation of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of [2Fe­2S], [3Fe­ 4S], and [4Fe­4S] was carried out and compared with the experimental data of the holo-AtCnfU-V in the k3-weighted Fe EXAFS function, as described in Materials and Methods (Fig. 7b). According to the previous study,20 the simulations were employed with the assumption that the spectrum is composed of the backscattered waves of two contributors, namely, four sulfur atoms at 2.26 Å with a Debye­ Waller factor of 0.008 Å2 and iron atom(s) at 2.7 Å with a Debye­Waller factor of 0.007 Å2. We successfully found a difference in the theoretical simulations. The single peak adjacent to k = 8 Å- 1 in the simulation that mimics a [2Fe­2S] cluster (Fig. 7b, top) broadens with an increase in Fe neighbors (as in [3Fe­4S] cluster; Fig. 7b, middle) and finally splits into two peaks if a [4Fe­4S] cluster is assumed. The variation is probably due to the different amplitude of Fe­Fe backscattering as described previously.20 The k-space EXAFS from the experimental data of holo-AtCnfU-V displays a single peak adjacent to k = 8 Å- 1, which sufficiently fits the corresponding peak of the simulated spectrum by assuming the presence of a [2Fe­2S] cluster. These data strongly suggest that the fourcoordinate ferric complex bound to the AtCnfU-V dimer is a [2Fe­2S] cluster, rather than a [3Fe­4S] or a [4Fe­4S] cluster. The Fourier transform (over a k range of 2­ 12 Å- 1) of the Fe K-edge k3-weighted EXAFS function of holo-AtCnfU-V is given in Fig. 7c. The curve-fitting analysis was carried out by assuming that four sulfur atoms and one iron atom scatter around each iron atom as in a [2Fe­2S] cluster. The best-fit values are listed in Table 2. The Fe­S and Fe­Fe interactions at distances of 2.26 Å and 2.70 Å, respectively, are quite consistent with [2Fe­2S]containing proteins such as maize Fd I, although the estimated values represent average distances. Therefore, not only the structure of the assembled [2Fe­2S] cluster itself but also its coordination environment with four thiolate ligands should be reasonably acceptable to the holo-AtCnfU-V dimer. Since only two S atoms exist per AtCnfU-V monomer in the C45-X-X-C48 motif, we now propose that one [2Fe­2S] cluster is intermolecularly coordinated

Discussion
A hypothetical model of holo-AtCnfU-V In this report, we have demonstrated the crystal structure of the metal-free apo form of the AtCnfU-V dimer, in which a total of four S atoms of invariant cysteine residues are located in close proximity to each other at the dimer interface and form a likely Fe­S cluster assembly site. In addition, by X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies, the presence of a typical [2Fe­2S] cluster coordinated by four thiolate ligands in the holo-AtCnfU-V dimer has been shown. Based on this structural information, we attempted to build a hypothetical model of the assembled [2Fe­ 2S] cluster in the holo-AtCnfU-V dimer. Firstly, the most plausible coordination pattern by four S atoms for two Fe atoms should be considered. In general, two adjacent cysteinyl ligands in the CXXC motif are bound to different Fe atoms in the known [2Fe­2S]-containing proteins.21 For example, in spinach ferredoxin,22 the two adjacent S atoms of C44 and C47, which have a 5.8-Å distance, coordinate two different Fe atoms (Fig. 8a, bottom). Indeed, the distance between two S atoms in the C45-X-X-C48

motif observed in the apo-AtCnfU-V structure is 6.5 Å (Fig. 8a, top), which seems to be too long to coordinate the same Fe; therefore, the two S atoms of each AtCnfU-V monomer presumably ligate two different Fe atoms. On the other hand, the distance between two S atoms of cysteine residues that coordinate one Fe atom in the typical [2Fe­2S]-cluster-containing protein, such as plant ferredoxin, is about 3.7 Å. In the apoAtCnfU-V dimer, C45(A) and C48(B) [or C45(B) and C48 (A)] form a disulfide bond where two bound S atoms are located at 2.2 Å distance from each other (Fig. 8a, top); therefore, they are a likely pair that coordinates one Fe atom. Together with the experimentally determined information on the distances between the two Fe atoms and between Fe and neighboring sulfur atoms by EXAFS (Fig. 7c and Table 2), we could assign the most plausible coordination pattern of the [2Fe­2S] cluster assembled between two AtCnfU-V monomers (Fig. 8a, middle). We also tried to fit the tentative [2Fe­ 2S] cluster into the tertiary structure of the AtCnfU-V dimer as shown in Fig. 8b. To achieve this, each interdomain loop (from A75 to G82) and the side chains of C45 and C48 were slightly rearranged. Since, as noted previously, the OH group of S51 covers the likely Fe­S cluster binding site, the C­CH2 bond of S51 needed to be also slightly rotated to prevent steric hindrance for the assembled cluster. It should be noted that we could build the model by moving only residues; C45, C48, and S51; and an extended loop from A75 to G82, all of which exhibit moderately elevated B-factors and thus are assumed to be structurally mobile.

The hypothetical model of the holo-AtCnfU dimer suggests that the large portion of the assembled [2Fe­2S] cluster itself, including both Fe atoms, and also the coordinating S atoms of four cysteinyl ligands should be significantly exposed to solvent (Fig. 8b). In typical [2Fe­2S]-cluster-containing proteins, not only Fe and inorganic sulfur atoms of the assembled [2Fe­2S] cluster but also the ligating cysteinyl sulfur atoms are rarely exposed. Such surface exposure of the assembled Fe­S cluster and its ligands on the AtCnfU-V dimer would be important for the function as a Fe­S cluster biosynthetic scaffold, since the Fe­S cluster assembled on AtCnfU-V should be readily accessible to acceptor proteins.

Fig. 8. Hypothetical model of the holodimeric form of AtCnfU-V. (a) Schematic diagram of the Fe­S cluster structure. Red and yellow circles represent Fe and S atoms, respectively. The distances between S atoms of the conserved cysteine residues in the structure of apoAtCnfU-V are indicated at the top. The middle panel shows the hypothetical coordination environment of the Fe­S cluster assembled on the holo form of AtCnfU-V. The distance values between Fe­Fe and Fe­ S atoms are calculated from the Fe K-edge absorption spectroscopic analysis. At the bottom, the structure of the [2Fe­2S] cluster assembled on spinach ferredoxin is shown (PDB ID 1A70).22 (b) A close-up view of the hypothetical model of the holo form of AtCnfU-V. Red and yellow spheres indicate Fe and S atoms, respectively.

Alternatively, the two S atoms of C48(A) and C48 (B) have a 4.84-Å distance in the determined apodimeric AtCnfU-V structure and might possibly coordinate one Fe atom. If this is the case, the relative positioning of the two N-terminal domains should be significantly altered to place the two S atoms of C45(A) and C45(B) closely enough to coordinate the other Fe atom, since, in the apodimeric AtCnfU-V structure, the latter two S atoms have a distance of 8.16 Å. Even if a large conformational or positional rearrangement occurs within the two N-terminal domains upon assembly or delivery of the [2Fe­2S] cluster, the overall dimer structure might be maintained by the site II interaction involving the C-terminal domain that is connected to the N-terminal domain with the flexible loop of A75-G82. Interestingly, in addition to the C45-X-X-C48 Fe­S cluster binding site, the following segment from P49

to M53 exhibits more elevated B-factors and is located at the S-atom-exposed side of the apoAtCnfU-V dimer (Fig. 4c). Hence, we can easily speculate that such mobility of the segment, which partially covers the Fe­S cluster binding site, should help the structural rearrangement of this region upon Fe­S cluster assembly and delivery. Moreover, this segment forms the hydrophilic but uncharged patch around the C45-X-X-C48 motif (Fig. 5). This also seems suitable for function as a Fe­S cluster biosynthetic scaffold because such scaffold proteins should possess rather broad specificities to various substrates, but should not form a stable complex with any specific substrate. Remarkable evolutionary conservation of the amino acid residues surrounding the C45-X-X-C48 motif among the CnfU/Nfu protein family supports the importance of the uncharged region for the function of the CnfU/Nfu-type scaffold (Fig. 2).

Structural comparison of AtCnfU-V and mouse mitochondrial Nfu protein When we were preparing this article, an NMR solution structure of the apomonomeric form of mitochondrial Nfu from a mouse was deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (not yet published as of May 28) (Fig. 9a). As compared to the cyanobacterial CnfU or to the N-terminal domain of chloroplastic CnfU, mitochondrially localized Nfu proteins contain an extra domain at the N-terminus following their mitochondrial presequences. The recombinant mouse Nfu used for the NMR study lacked this N-terminal extra domain. Superposing one representative of the 20 deposited NMR structural models of mouse Nfu onto the N-terminal domain of AtCnfU-V revealed essentially similar overall folds representing an average r.m.s.d. of 2.57 Å over the best-matched 60 amino acid residues. The fact that the CXXC-motif-containing region in the mouse Nfu was less constrained by the NMR restraints might suggest that it is structurally flexible just like the corresponding region of AtCnfU-V, whose flexibility was suggested by its elevated Bfactors in the crystal.

Interestingly, Mössbaure spectral studies of human mitochondrial Nfu and Azotobacter vinelandii NifU have suggested that a [4Fe­4S] cluster, rather than a [2Fe­2S] cluster, is bound to Nfu and the C-terminal domain of NifU.9,10 On the other hand, AtCnfU-V and the cyanobacterial ortholog bind a [2Fe­2S] cluster.7,11 This difference might be derived from their distinct evolutionary histories. Nfu-type (or NifU-type) scaffolds and CnfU have evolved under very distinct intracellular environments; Nfu and NifU must function under oxygen-consuming or even anaerobic conditions, whereas cyanobacterial and chloroplastic CnfU should function under oxygen-producing photosynthetic environments. Indeed, when expressed in Escherichia coli, mitochondrial Nfu was isolated as the apo form and could only bind an extremely oxygen-labile [4Fe­4S] cluster in vitro,10 whereas CnfU could be purified as the [2Fe­2S]-cluster-containing holo form from E. coli cells even under ambient air.7,11 Very recently, E. coli and A. vinelandii Nfu homologs, termed NfuA, were demonstrated to bind a [4Fe­4S] cluster by anaerobic reconstitution.23,24 It should be noted that virtually all characterized Nfu homologs, including bacterial NfuA and mitochondrial Nfu, possess an additional

171 On the other hand, it seems suitable for the scaffolding function of AtCnfU-V that the interaction to form a dimer is not so rigid, which can lead to facile conversion from dimer to monomer. The transiently assembled Fe­S cluster on AtCnfU-V should not be held so firmly in the site I dimer interface because the assembled cluster should be released for delivery to substrates. Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum analysis indicates that the structure of the Fe­S cluster on AtCnfU-V is not abnormal as described above, suggesting that instability of the Fe­S cluster on the scaffold AtCnfU-V might not be dependent on the structure of the Fe­S cluster itself, but on the likely exposed property of the assembled Fe­S cluster and also on the instability of the dimeric form of AtCnfU-V. The questions on how Nfu and cyanobacterial CnfU lacking the repeated C-terminal domain can form a dimer and on whether the dimeric arrangement of Nfu or cyanobacterial CnfU is similar to that found in the AtCnfU dimer still remain. Unfortunately, although NMR structures of some homologues of CnfU/Nfu have been deposited into the PDB database, no dimeric structure has been solved, except for the AtCnfU structure described here. The comparison of the AtCnfU-V dimer structure to those of other homologues, such as cyanobacterial CnfU, might help to elucidate any additional role of the Cterminal domain that is unique to chloroplastic CnfU. In conclusion, here we have reported the first homodimeric crystal structure of CnfU. The dimeric organization, which is supported by both biochemical and EXAFS data, allows a formation of the bridging [2Fe­2S] cluster at the dimer interface, explaining the scaffolding function of CnfU for the Fe­S cluster assembly.

amino-terminal domain of more than 100 amino acid residues that are absent in CnfU. This also suggests the evolutionary and functional divergence between Nfu-type and CnfU-type scaffolds. A possibility that CnfU can assemble a [4Fe­4S] cluster, in addition to the [2Fe­2S] cluster, should be considered because AtCnfU-V deficiency in plants leads to a decrease in both ferredoxin and photosystem I,11,12 which possess [2Fe­2S] and [4Fe­4S] clusters, respectively. However, the fact that another protein named Hcf101 was shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of [4Fe­4S] clusters, but not in the biosynthesis of [2Fe­2S] clusters, in chloroplasts25,26 suggests that the participation of AtCnfU in [4Fe­4S] cluster biosynthesis might be indirect and requires some additional factors that function downstream of AtCnfU. Hcf101 is a likely candidate for one such factor. Proteins share similar  +  folds with the CnfU domain When a search for other protein structures with features similar to those of AtCnfU-V was conducted using the alignment program Dali27, several Khomology (KH)-domain-containing proteins, such as Era GTPase (Fig. 9c), and the mononuclear metallochaperone proteins, such as CopZ (Fig. 9b), were found to share apparently similar  +  folds. However, the exact orders or steric arrangements of respective  or  segments are slightly different from each other. In addition, the location of the metalbinding motif MHCXXC in the copper chaperone CopZ is completely different from that of the CXXC motif in AtCnfU-V. Structural comparison of the N-terminal domain of AtCnfU-V to IscU and IscA, other types of Fe­S cluster biosynthetic scaffolds,28­32 indicates that IscA has quite a different fold from AtCnfU-V, while the folds of CnfU and IscU significantly resemble each other in respect to both the location of invariant cysteine residues and the structural arrangement of some -helices and -strands (Fig. 9d and e). This may reflect a common structural basis between the two Fe­S cluster biosynthetic scaffold proteins. Role of the C-terminal domain in stabilization of dimeric configuration As shown in Fig. 6a, although the C-terminal domain is not involved directly in Fe­S cluster binding that occurs at site I between two N-terminal domains, the two site II interactions likely stabilize the dimer configuration. However, a mutant AtCnfU-V in which both invariant cysteine residues were substituted with serine residues can neither bind Fe­S clusters nor form a stable dimer (data not shown). In addition, we previously observed an increase in the monomeric form of wild-type AtCnfU-V protein upon disruption of the Fe­S cluster bound to AtCnfU-V with dithionite,11 suggesting that the site II interaction alone is not sufficient to form a stable AtCnfU-V apo dimer.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification, and crystallization AtCnfU-V was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously.11 Purified protein at a concentration of 40 mg/ml dissolved in 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol was used for crystallization. Crystals of apo-AtCnfU-V were prepared by hangingdrop vapor-diffusion method at 4 °C by mixing 1 l of protein solution and 2 l of reservoir solution consisting of 21% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.95 M magnesium chloride, and 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). To prepare the platinum derivative of the protein crystals, native crystals were soaked in the reservoir solution containing 1 mM K2PtCl4 and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h. After incubation, soaked crystals were subsequently transferred to and incubated in the reservoir solution at 4 °C for 1 h. The crystals of both the native and the platinum derivatives were transferred briefly to 40% 2-methylpentan-2,4-diol, 0.95 M magnesium chloride, and 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) to be soaked in liquid nitrogen for storage and data collection. Maize Fd I was purified as described previously.17 Data collection and refinement Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 (synchrotron radiation facility in Japan)

and an imaging plate detector (DIP6040). Diffraction data were indexed, merged, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK.33 The crystalbelongs tothespacegroupP222, withcelldimensionsofa = 43.5Å,b = 57.4Å,c = 61.3Å, = 90°,  = 90°, and  = 90°. Initial phases were calculated with SHARP34 using the intensity data of Native 1 and Pt. The initial model was built with the ARP/wARP program.13 Anisotropic refinement was carried out using the program REFMAC5,35 with the intensity data of Native 2. Details of crystallographicstatisticsandtherefinedmodelareshownin Table 1. All figures depicting the structure were generated usingMOLMOL36 orPyMOL.37 X-ray absorption spectroscopy The Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectra study was carried out on the bending magnet beamline BL01B1 of the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-838 (proposal no. 2002A0554-NX-np) with a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. Harmonic contamination was rejected using a total reflection mirror aligned at 6 mrad. Energies were calibrated using Cu foil as internal standers. Purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol with 30% (wt/vol) glycerol to prevent the formation of ice crystals that interfere with EXAFS signals, flash-frozen in sample folders, and maintained at 100 K during the measurements. The beam size for all experiments was approximately 8 mm (width) × 1 mm (height) by upstream slits. The spectra were measured in fluorescence mode with an ORTEC 19element Ge solid-state detector. Comparison of the XANES between maize Fd I and CnfU was performed after background subtraction and normalization with respect to the edge jump height. The pre-edge peak areas were obtained by integrating over the range of 7108­ 7114 eV. For collection of the EXAFS data of CnfU, successive scans of the Fe K-edge position were monitored for irradiation damage or photoreduction. Each scan took about 1 h. Although no irradiation damage was observed, multiple samples were prepared for verification of the reproducibility of spectra. Only the first two or three scans were collected and used in the averaging (the total number of averaged scans used in the EXAFS analysis was 11). EXAFS data were analyzed using the package WinXAS Version 3.1.39 The EXAFS data (k) were extracted from the averaged datasets. Although data were collected to k = 16 Å, the k-weighted EXAFS signal k3(k) was filtered by a Bassel function and Fourier transformed over the range of 2 b k b 12 Å- 1 into the Rspace. Amplitude and phase data used in the simulation and curve fitting were calculated by FEFF8.2 code.40 Input parameters for the FEFF calculation were modeled from the known crystal structure of [2Fe­2S] ferredoxin from maize (PDB ID 1GAQ).17 A two-shell model, where only sulfur and iron were scattered around each iron atom, was adapted for the simulation and curve fitting. The curve fitting was performed in R-space over the range of 0.8 b R -  b 2.9 Å, where the coordination numbers were fixed. The other fitting parameters, including the distance (r), the Debye­Waller factor (2), the shift in photoelectron energy (E0), and the amplitude reduction factor (S2), were allowed to vary. 0 The fitting was reasonably well-converged as shown in Table 2. The value (0.55) obtained for S2 was relatively 0 smaller than typical samples; however, it is in accordance with a couple of proteins with Fe­S cluster.41
