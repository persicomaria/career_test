Glutamate mutase (Glm) is an adenosylcobamide-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of (2S)-glutamate to (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartate. The active enzyme from Clostridium cochlearium consists of two subunits (of 53.6 and 14.8 kDa) as an a2b2 tetramer, whose assembly is mediated by coenzyme B12. The smaller of the protein components, GlmS, has been suggested to be the B12-binding subunit. Here we report the solution structure of GlmS, determined from a heteronuclear NMR-study, and the analysis of important dynamical aspects of this apoenzyme subunit. The global fold and dynamic behavior of GlmS in solution are similar to those of the corresponding subunit MutS from C. tetanomorphum, which has previously been investigated using NMR-spectroscopy. Both solution structures of the two Glm B12-binding subunits share striking similarities with that determined by crystallography for the B12-binding domain of methylmalonyl CoA mutase (Mcm) from Propionibacterium shermanii, which is B12 bound. In the crystal structure a conserved histidine residue was found to be coordinated to cobalt, displacing the endogenous axial ligand of the cobamide. However, in GlmS and MutS the sequence motif, Asp-x-His-x-x-Gly, which includes the cobalt-coordinating histidine residue, and a predicted a-helical region following the motif, are present as an unstructured and highly mobile loop. In the absence of coenzyme, the B12-binding site apparently is only partially formed. By comparing the crystal structure of Mcm with the solution structures of B12-free GlmS and MutS, a consistent picture on the mechanism of B12 binding has been obtained. Important elements of the binding site only become structured upon binding B12; these include the cobalt-coordinating histidine residue, and an a helix that forms one side of the cleft accommodating the nucleotide `tail' of the coenzyme. Keywords: coenzyme B12; glutamate mutase; heteronuclear NMR; protein dynamics; protein structure. Four decades after its discovery [1], adenosylcobalamin, or coenzyme B12 (Fig. 1, 1), as well as the enzymatic reactions in which this B12 derivative serves as cofactor, still fascinate chemists and biologists alike. The principal interest in this molecule stems from the fact that it was the first, and still is one of the few, naturally occurring organometallic compounds known to have a role as a coenzyme [2].

revealed the unusual structure of this organometallic corrinoid compound [3], in which a 5 H -deoxyadenosyl group is axially attached through the 5 H -carbon to the upper face of the cobalt center. The weakness of the bond between the cobalt center and the 5 H -carbon of the organometallic ligand is the basis for the special property of this coenzyme as a source of a free radical [4,5]. It is commonly accepted that in adenosylcobalamincontaining proteins the enzymatic reaction is initiated by the homolysis of the cobalt±carbon bond leading to the formation of a free 5 H -deoxyadenosyl radical and cob(II)alamin [2]. A second organometallic B12 derivative of biological relevance is methylcobalamin (Fig. 1, 2). Enzymes that require methylcobalamin catalyze important methyl transfer reactions in human, animal and bacterial metabolism [2]. The B12binding domain (metH) of methionine synthase (MetH) from Escherichia coli was the first B12-dependent enzyme to be successfully subjected to crystallographic structure analysis [6]. The most surprising aspect of this structure was the discovery that the intramolecularly coordinating dimethylbenzimidazole moiety of the intact cofactor 2 [7] is displaced in the enzymebound 2 and is replaced by a histidine side chain of the protein. Accordingly, in MetH the methyl-Co(III)corrin 2 is bound in a `base-off/His-on' form [6,8]. In turn, the nucleotide tail of 2, which is dissociated from the corrin-bound cobalt center, is buried into a cleft of the B12-binding enzyme. The cobalt coordinated histidine residue is involved in a hydrogen-bonding network comprising an aspartate and a serine residue. This set of three residues has been dubbed the His±Asp±Ser `regulatory ligand triad' and has been suggested to control the coordination

properties of the cobalt corrin during the catalytic cycle [6,8,9]. The first two residues of this triad form part of the Asp-x-His-xx-Gly sequence fingerprint which has been detected in some [10] but not all [11] B12-dependent enzymes (Fig. 2). More recently, the first crystal structure of an adenosylcobalamindependent enzyme has been solved, of methylmalonyl CoA mutase (Mcm) from Propionibacterium shermanii [12]. The structure of Mcm revealed striking similarities in the mode of binding of the cofactor to that of metH: again, the corrinoid cofactor is bound in the base-off/His-on form and a `regulatory triad' is found, with a similar hydrogen-bonding network between its His±Asp±Lys residues [12]. Glutamate mutase (Glm) from Clostridium cochlearium and from C. tetanomorphum catalyzes the reversible carbon skeleton rearrangement of (2S)-glutamate to (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartate (Fig. 3; [13]), which is the first step in the fermentation of

glutamate to acetate and butyrate [14,15]. The enzyme from C. tetanomorphum was discovered in 1964 [16] and found to use pseudocoenzyme B12 (1b) as cofactor [17]. Glm from C. cochlearium consists of two functionally distinct protein components: GlmE, a homodimer (12) representing the substratebinding site, and GlmS (s), the suggested B12-binding subunit harboring the Asp-x-His-x-x-Gly sequence motif [13,18,19]. Incubation of the purified recombinant components GlmE and GlmS with coenzyme B12 leads to the formation of an active heterotetramer (12s2; [19]). The active form of Glm from C. tetanomorphum is built up similarly by the corresponding subunits MutE and MutS, which share 94 and 83% sequence identities with the subunits GlmE and GlmS of the mutase from C. cochlearium, respectively [20]. Pseudocoenzyme B12 (1b) and its homolog Coa-2-methyladeninyl-Cob-5 H -deoxy5 H -adenosyl-cobamide (1c, `adenosyl-factor A') were both

The sequence identities of GlmS with the B12-binding domains of Mcm and MetH are 31 and 19%, respectively [55]. Invariant residues are shown in bold type.

shown to be the native adenosyl cofactors of C. cochlearium (B. Hoffmann, H. Bothe, W. Buckel, E. Stupperich, R. Konrat È & B. Krautler, unpublished data). In the cofactors 1b and 1c, adenine and 2-methyladenine, respectively, replace the 5 H ,6 H dimethylbenzimidazole base of coenzyme B12 (Fig. 1; [17]). In the coenzyme forms 1b and 1c coordination of the nucleotide function to the cobalt center is weak so that in neutral aqueous solution both coenzymes occur in the `base-off' form ([17]; È and W. Fieber, W. Schmidt, B. Hoffmann & B. Krautler, unpublished data]. In contrast, coenzyme B12 (1) exists in the well-known `base-on' form under physiological pH conditions. Recently, the solution structure and the backbone dynamical properties of the corrinoid free subunit MutS of glutamate mutase from C. tetanomorphum have been determined in our group using NMR spectroscopy [21]. Comparison of the crystal structures of the B12-binding domains of methionine synthase (metH), and of methylmalonyl CoA mutase (mutB), each with bound B12 cofactor, and the solution structure of the MutS apoenzyme revealed striking similarities. While the major part of MutS is well structured with a tertiary structure as found in metH and Mcm, the segment of the protein which contains the Asp-x-His-x-x-Gly motif, forms part of an unstructured and mobile extended loop [21]. The structural comparison between a B12-free protein (MutS) and two B12 holoproteins (metH, mutB) has lead to the conclusion that important elements of

the B12-binding cleft accommodating the nucleotide `tail' of the cofactor would become structured only upon binding of the cofactor. Using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy we have now determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the corrinoidfree subunit GlmS from Glm of C. cochlearium. This study is the second NMR spectroscopic investigation of a B12-binding protein, to be reported. The emphasis of the work on GlmS was to clarify to what extent the remarkable structural features of MutS from C. tetanomorphum [21] would be representative for coenzyme B12-dependent enzymes that bind the B12-cofactor in the base-off/His-on constitution, and to assess the structural effect of the nonconserved residues half of which are indicated by MutS to line the crucial structured part of the nucleotide binding cleft of GlmS.

Laboratories, Inc.), as the nitrogen source and ampicillin (0.1 g´L21) in order to maintain selection for the plasmid pOZ3 [18]. GlmS was isolated and purified by subsequent application of the cell-free extract to a phenyl±Sepharose column (HiLoad 26/10, Pharmacia) and to a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) [22]. In order to obtain an appropriate level of purity, GlmS was subjected to a further purification step with a DEAE column. For this purpose, the GlmScontaining fractions of the Superdex 200 column were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and concentrated to <10 mL. The concentrate was applied to the DEAE column previously equilibrated by buffer A. Separation of GlmS from remaining contaminating E. coli proteins was achieved by a linear increasing salt gradient (buffer A to 40% buffer B, 600 mL; buffer B: 0.5 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). GlmS starts to elute at <17% of buffer B. To both buffers 2 mm dithiothreitol was added for the column run. The GlmScontaining solution was dialyzed against dithiothreitol-free

The side chain of residue His16 is represented as a stick drawing (green). Both figures were generated using the program molmol [56].

dynamic information was obtained from measuring 15N longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and transverse relaxation time (T2), and heteronuclear 1H± 15N NOE, using pulse schemes similar to those described by Farrow et al. [30]. To measure the 15 N attenuation factors two sets of HSQC spectra, with and without saturation of the water signal, were recorded. For the procedure to extract the 15N T1 and T2 values, steady-state 15 N± 1H NOE enhancements and 15N attenuation factors from the NMR spectra also see Tollinger et al. [21]. Input restraints NOE-derived distance restraints, backbone dihedral angle restraints (for the backbone angle F) and backbone hydrogen bond restraints for residues in elements of secondary structure were obtained and defined as described elsewhere [21]. Exceptions to this were hydrogen-bond restraints between the hydroxyl protons of Tyr89, Tyr113 and Tyr117 and the carboxy groups of Asp133, Asp79 and Asp129, respectively. In addition, a hydrogen-bond restraint was defined between H1 of Arg115 and the carboxy group of Asp133. Since no stereospecific discrimination between both oxygen atoms of the aspartate carboxylate functions could be made, hydrogen bonds were defined as distance restraints between the Hbonding hydrogen and the Cg atoms of the aspartate side Ê chains, corresponding to limits of 1.8±3.0 A. The presence of these hydrogen bonds can be deduced from the spectral observation of the corresponding exchange labile side-chain protons, indicating slow intermolecular exchange and protection from exchange with bulk water protons. In the case of Tyr89 and Tyr117 the identification of the most likely hydrogen bond acceptors (i.e. the carboxy functions of Asp133 and Asp129) were supported by the observation of NOEs between the hydroxyl protons of Tyr89 and Tyr117 and side-chain protons Hb of residue Asp133 and Asp129, respectively. Structure calculations Three-dimensional structures were calculated in a standard distance geometry (DG) [31]/simulated annealing (SA) [32]/ simulated annealing refinement/energy minimization protocol using xplor software (version 3.1) [33] on SGI Crimson and Indigo 2 workstations. First, an initial ensemble of 30 structures was generated from a covalent template structure with randomized backbone dihedral angles F and C and extended side chains. In this first stage a total of 639 NOE-derived distance restraints was applied. The generated structures served for the

identification of more NOE restraints which were introduced in the input restraints set; in addition, backbone dihedral angle restraints and hydrogen-bond restraints were added to this set. Of the 30 structures obtained in the first stage of structure calculation the one with a minimum of restraint violations and minimal energy was chosen. Starting from this structure, in a second stage of calculation 120 optimized structures were derived employing an simulated annealing/simulated annealing refinement/energy minimization protocol. Of these 120 structures the 15 best with respect to restraints violations and energy were used for final refinement using a restraint Powell energy minimization with the charmm force field [34].

NMR analyses The NMR spectra indicated that GlmS, the small subunit of glutamate mutase from C. cochlearium, adopts a largely defined structure in aqueous solution. The sensitivity-enhanced two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectrum is shown in Fig. 4. For the 132 nonproline residues of GlmS, signals for 96 backbone amide functions (70% of the GlmS sequence) were observed; for 36 backbone groups a signal was not seen, presumably due to fast exchange with bulk water at pH 7.4 and/or rapid conformational change. Sequential assignment could be carried out by following the È well-established strategy described by Wuthrich [35]. Spin systems were identified in the three-dimensional 15N TOCSYHSQC spectrum and sequentially assigned by combining this information with the three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC and two-dimensional SS NOESY and 15N-filtered NOESY spectra. This strategy allowed the signal assignment of the spin systems of 93 residues, corresponding to 68% of the GlmS sequence. Elements of regular secondary structure were primarily identified on the basis of their specific cross-peak patterns [35] observed in the three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC. The secondary structure is also reflected by secondary DHa shifts (i.e. the difference in chemical shift between experimental Ha and random coil values; [36,37]) given in Fig. 5. The b strands generally exhibit a characteristic downfield shift, whereas the helical region is clearly shifted towards the higher field. There is a good agreement between DHa secondary shift values and the assignment of secondary structure elements from NOE patterns along the sequence. Additional information about secondary structure elements was extracted from 3J(HNHa) coupling constants and amide proton attenuation factors.

structure of GlmS are shown in Fig. 6. Two-thirds of the protein are structurally well defined. The core of the molecule consists of a five-stranded twisted parallel b sheet (b1: residues 4±8, b2: residues 33±36, b3: residues 56±59, b4: residues 87±91 and b5: residues 115±118) with the strand order b2±b1±b3± b4±b5. This sheet is surrounded by four a helices (a2: residues 43±52, a3: residues 70±81, a4: residues 103±111 and a5: residues 125±136). These secondary structure elements are referred to using the labels introduced earlier for the description of the crystal structure of the B12-binding domains of MetH [6,8] and Mcm [12], in order to facilitate structural comparisons. The a helices are packed against both sides of the b sheet, with helices a2, a3 and a4 on one side of the b sheet and the C-terminal helix a5 on the other. Approximately one-third of the mostly undetectable residues belong to the (upper) segments linking the C-terminal ends of the b strands and the N-terminal ends of the a helices, indicating that this region of GlmS exhibits a highly dynamic behavior and does not participate in ordered structure elements. These conformationally undefined segments of the protein comprise residues Gly9±Phe27, Ile37±Pro42, Leu60±Gly67, Gly92±Pro102 and Pro119±Glu124, as well as the first two N-terminal residues. The 19 residues comprising segment Gly9±Phe27 cover a whole flank of GlmS. The average rmsd of Ê the 15 best GlmS structures is 1.33 ^ 0.20 A for the backbone a H atoms (N, C , C ), calculated under the exclusion of the unstructured segments (Table 1). Considering the well-structured parts of GlmS, the analysis of the dihedral angles F and C of the 15 best structures using the program prochecknmr [38] shows that 99.3% of these angles fall within the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Backbone dynamics N relaxation data of the backbone amide groups (15N T1 and T2 relaxation times and steady-state 1H± 15 N NOE enhancements) were analyzed in terms of the so-called model-free
15

approach [39,40] and extensions thereof [41,42] in order to obtain information about the backbone motional properties of GlmS. From the 93 1JNH-correlation peaks detected in the twodimensional 15N-HSQC spectra (Fig. 4) and assigned to backbone amide groups, 66 correlation peaks could be subjected to this backbone dynamical analysis. Overlap of resonances or extremely weak resonances caused by conformational exchange and/or by rapid amide-solvent exchange prevented relaxation data being obtained for the remaining amide groups. The overall correlation time tm of GlmS was determined using the method described by Farrow et al. [30] and was calculated as tm = 8.5 ^ 1.0 ns. This value is almost identical with the tm of 8.7 ^ 0.6 ns measured for MutS [21] and is in good agreement with the value expected for a monomeric protein of the molecular mass of GlmS (14.8 kDa) [43]. The result of the 15N relaxation measurements are illustrated in Fig. 7A±C, in which order parameters (S2), the effective internal correlation times (either te in the LipariSzabo model or ts in the extended Liparo-Szabo model), and exchange contributions (Rex) are plotted as a function of residue number. The average value of the order parameter (S2), over all considered residues, is 0.81 (average S2 in MutS 0.79). The various residues could be divided into three classes, according to the timescales of their internal mobilities. The first class comprises 19 residues described by the classical Lipari-Szabo model showing order parameters (average S2 <0.86) and internal correlation times (average te <25 ps) typical for residues in secondary structure elements. Thirteen of these residues are indeed located in a b-sheet or ahelical structure (Fig. 7A,B). However, these residues are isolated from each other and are distributed statistically over the primary sequence. The 15N relaxation parameters of a second class of 27 residues are best fitted with a motional model including an additional term for conformational exchange Rex. This indicates these residues to be involved in significant `slow' backbone motions on a ms to ms time scale. The residues with the highest Rex values are Ile11, Ser13, Gln43, Glu44, Phe46, Leu59, Glu68, Cys71 and Ala118

These residues show significant internal mobility in the ns time range (Fig. 7B), superimposed on small angle fluctuations in the ps timescale. A surprising majority of these residues are located within well-defined secondary structure elements, where typically higher order parameters are found, especially along the helix a4 and in the middle of helix a5. Hydrogen exchange Amide proton attenuation factors were used to monitor the intermolecular exchange of amide protons. Figure 7D shows the measured GlmS attenuation factors as a function of residue position and the values are superimposed with the MutS attenuation factors [21]. In MutS, the attenuation factors are quite uniform in well-structured regions; residues with significantly lower values are found for the N-terminal and Cterminal residues, as well as for residues located in loop regions of MutS, indicating that these residues are involved in a faster amide hydrogen exchange with the solvent. In contrast, in GlmS residues involved in elements of regular secondary structure also display lower than average attenuation factors. Nearly all residues in b strands and a number of residues in ahelices a2±a5 are concerned. Residues Ile11, Ser13, Gln43, Leu59, Glu68, Cys71, Tyr117, Ala118 and Thr121 exhibit the lowest attenuation factors (Figs 7D, 8A). Most of these residues are also involved in considerable conformational flexibility as probed by their exchange rates Rex (Figs 7C, 8A).

DISCUSSION
In Glm of C. cochlearium, the smaller subunit GlmS is essential for binding of the adenosylcobamide cofactor [18,19]. EPR spectroscopic studies on 15 N-labeled Glm have

helped to identify a histidine residue of GlmS to coordinate to the B12 cobalt center [44]. A related situation was revealed for MutS, the homologous B12-binding subunit of Glm from C. tetanomorphum [20,45,46]. The crystal structures of the B12-binding domains of methionine synthase from E. coli (MetH; 6,8) and of methylmalonyl CoA mutase from P. shermanii (Mcm; 12), both with their cofactors bound, revealed that these proteins adopt a fold with a pattern of alternating b-sheet and a-helix structural elements. This fold is a variant of the canonical nucleotide-binding or so-called `Rossmann' fold [47±49]. Recently, the first solution structure of a B12-binding protein was solved by our group [21]. This study on the (corrinoid free) B12-binding subunit MutS revealed important structural differences between cofactor-free and the known cofactor-carrying B12-binding domains (of Mcm and MetH; [21]). A comparison of the three-dimensional structures of GlmS, MutS and mutB (the B12-binding domain of Mcm) is given in Fig. 9. The solution structure of GlmS is very similar to that of MutS [21] and features a twisted b sheet (composed by five parallel b strands) surrounded by four roughly parallel a helices. Accordingly, the folds of both of these B12-binding subunits in solution share striking similarities with the crystal structures of mutB [12] and the B12-binding domain metH [6,8] of methionine synthase (not shown). An important difference concerns the unstructured and highly mobile segment of the residues 9±27 in GlmS (13±27 in MutS). The corresponding residues of the mutB and metH sequences are involved in the formation of the additional a-helix a1, so that in mutB and metH the b sheet in the core is surrounded by five (instead of four) a helices. Despite their highly similar global fold, there are some distinct structural and dynamic differences between the GlmS and MutS solution structures. In general, the structure of GlmS appears to be less compact than that of MutS. In MutS, <20% of the residues appear to exhibit dynamic behavior and do not participate in elements of regular secondary structure [21]. In

GlmS this value is increased to <40%. Fewer and weaker NOE contacts are observed at the (upper) C-terminal ends of the b strands and the (upper) N-terminal ends of the a helices. Compared with MutS [21], in GlmS b strands b1±b3 are accordingly 1±3 residues shorter at their C-terminal ends and helices a3±a5 are 1±2 residues shorter at their N-terminal ends. Residues adjacent to these ends of secondary structure elements are exchange broadened and not detectable. In general, the elements of regular secondary structure appear to continuously become more dynamic when moving from the `lower' to the `upper' part of the molecule. Part of the different degrees of detectability of GlmS and MutS resonances is likely to be due to the distinct pH conditions applied for the analysis of both proteins. NMR measurements on GlmS were carried out at pH 7.4. A slightly acidic pH of 6.0 was chosen for the measurements with MutS [21]. The slightly alkaline conditions in the case of GlmS result in an increased rate of hydrogen exchange between the backbone amide groups and bulk water which, in turn, lowers the amide proton T2-relaxation times. This is indeed reflected by the amide proton attenuation factors, which are generally somewhat lower for GlmS than for MutS (Fig. 7D). However, the lower number of detected GlmS spin systems is unlikely to be exclusively the result of distinct pH conditions. The lowering of the pH from 8.0 to 6.35 in NMR studies on calmodulin resulted in an average increase of the amide attenuation factors by only 0.1 units [50]. Taking this pHrelated increase into account, a number of GlmS residues still exhibit attenuation factors considerably lower than their MutS analogs or considerably lower than the average of all analyzed GlmS amide groups (Fig. 7D). Interestingly, most of these residues also exhibit increased Rex values (Fig. 7C) and are located adjacent or close to the undetected segments of GlmS (Fig. 8A). Both high conformational exchange contributions and increased amide hydrogen-exchange rates indicate that these residues are strongly flexible (on a ms to ms timescale). It is very likely that the undetected protein segments of GlmS are even more flexible than the observable residues considered in Fig. 8A. Furthermore, the flexibility of these GlmS segments is apparently more pronounced than in MutS. In MutS the most significant slow backbone motions have been observed for residues located in the unstructured segment linking b1 and b2, as well as for residues located in the loop linking b4 and a4 [21]. In contrast, amide resonances of these residues are not detected for GlmS. Of the three B12-binding proteins whose structures have been determined so far (metH, Mcm and MutS), GlmS shares the highest degree of structural identity with its functional analog MutS. The backbone heavy atoms of residues participating in elements of regular secondary structure (b1±b5, a2±a5) of Ê GlmS and MutS superimpose with a rmsd of 2.0 A. Detailed information about the degree of fit of the GlmS and MutS solution structure on a per residue basis is obtained by inspection of the pairwise rmsd (Fig. 8B). With the exception of the lateral b strand b2, whose residues display intermediate pairÊ wise rmsd with an average of 2.2 A, the remaining b strands Ê match best with an average pairwise rmsd of 1.0±1.15 A. Also helices a2 and a3 fit well with average pairwise rmsd of 1.8 Ê and 1.9 A, respectively. Only the N-terminal and C-terminal residues of both helices that are close to the more flexible loops have higher pairwise rmsd values. Distinct structural differences are observed for helices a4 and a5 whose pairwise rmsd Ê have mean values of 2.3 and 2.4 A, respectively. The differing relative position of helix a4 may be due to a lack of unambiguously assignable side-chain NOEs, which could

position this helix more clearly with respect to the rest of the GlmS molecule. In contrast, the different position of helix a5 is not an effect of missing NOE data. It may result from a local accumulation in helix a5 of seven (30%) of the 23 residues nonconserved between the GlmS and MutS sequences (Figs 2 and 8C). Furthermore, a number of residues in the b strand b4 and b5 whose side chains interact with helix a5 are exchanged. Two important interactions exist between b strand b4 and helix a5 in GlmS, which are not observed in MutS: Phe89 and Val133 located in b4 and in a5 of MutS, respectively, are replaced by Tyr89 and Asp133 in GlmS. The side chains of both residues are hydrogen bridged (Input restraints above). Another interesting replacement concerns residue 130, which is a methionine in MutS, but a leucine in GlmS. The resonance of the Hd-protons of one of the Leu130 methyl groups could be assigned in the two-dimensional SS NOESY spectrum of GlmS because of its extreme chemical shift at 0.0 p.p.m. clearly separating it from other spin systems. This shielded Leu130 methyl group shows NOEs to HN of Thr5, Ha of Ile6 (both located in b1) and Ha of Ala57 (located in b3), providing relevant distance constraints for the structure calculation of GlmS. The position of helix a5 with respect to the b sheet is of specific interest: helix a5, the b sheet and the unstructured loop connecting b1 and b2 are believed to line a major part of the hydrophobic-binding cleft for the nucleotide tail of the corrinoid cofactor in intact Glm. The comparison between MutS and mutB has shown that helix a5 and the b sheet open up the nucleotide binding cleft only insignificantly (by Ê # 0.6 A) upon binding of the corrinoid cofactor [21]. It is of interest to note that about half of the residues that are nonconserved in the two B12-binding subunits (GlmS and MutS) concern side chains that are indicated by the solution structure of GlmS to mutually interact at the interface of the b sheet and helix a5. As the folding of the nucleotide binding cleft is remarkably unaffected by the exchange of (nonconserved) residues, it appears as though a structural correlation exists between the mutations on helix a5 and on b strands b3 and b4. In the crystal structures of Mcm and metH the a helix a1 corresponds to the GlmS and MutS segment with residues 18±30. In Mcm and metH this helix forms part of the nucleotide binding cleft and provides residues that interact with the nucleotide base. In GlmS, as well as in MutS, the formation of a stable helix a1 is not observed. The GlmS residues between Gly9 and Phe27 do not give rise to detectable signals except for His25 and Ala26, which exhibit very weak resonances. This finding reflects the high flexibility and disordering of this segment. The intrinsic flexibility of the corresponding part of the homologous protein MutS has been observed in more detail [21]. 15N magnetic relaxation data of residues 13±27 indicate this segment of MutS to be disordered. Specifically the MutS segment between residues Val18 and Ala30 has been suggested to undergo interconversions between unstructured forms (i.e. random coil conformations) and an ahelical conformation, a dynamic structure property that may be well described by the term `nascent helix' [21,51]. Residues 11±17 of GlmS correspond to the loop which links the N-terminus of helix a1 with the C-terminus of b strand b1 in the Mcm and metH structures [6,12]. This loop harbors the strictly conserved B12-binding Asp-x-His-x-x-Gly motif. It is very likely that, upon B12 binding, residues His16 and Asp14 of GlmS/MutS would adopt a similar orientation with respect to the cobalt coordination of His16 and hydrogen-bond formation between His16 and Asp14 as observed in the `base-off/His-on'

form of their Mcm and metH analogs (see above). In support of this interpretation, the mutations of either Asp14 or His16 of MutS lead to a significant weakening of coenzyme binding and a 1000-fold reduction of turnover rates in catalysis [20]. In both, GlmS and MutS, His16 is part of this highly mobile segment and occupies a place at the surface of these B12-binding subunits (Fig. 6). This position is comparable with that of the corresponding His residue in the crystalline analogs mutB and metH (Fig. 9). The GlmS residues Ile37±Pro42, Leu60±Gly67, Gly92± Pro102 and Pro119±Glu124, which form the loops between the C-terminal ends of the b strands and the N-terminal ends of the a helices, are not detected either, reflecting a particular mobility. These residues cover the whole `upper' side of the GlmS molecule, which would interact with the corrin ring of the cofactor in the B12-bound state and/or with GlmE, the substrate activating subunit in the holoenzyme. Quite remarkably, with the exception of P42, H100 and P122, all residues of these flexible portions are conserved between the two B12-binding subunits (GlmS and MutS), in contrast to the sizeable number of nonconserved residues in the core of these B12-binding proteins. Consistent with this result from our structural investigation, heterologous holoenzymes (from GlmS and MutE or from GlmE and MutS) showed considerable enzymatic activity (U. Leutbecher & W. Buckel, unpublished, cited in [52]). With GlmS and MutS, two homologous B12-binding subunits have been investigated in aqueous solution. A remarkable structural and dynamical similarity of these B12-binding subunits was found. The present study indicates that the folding pattern of GlmS is strongly related to that of MutS [21] and thus represents a typical situation for this type of B12-binding subunit. The solution structures of both GlmS and MutS, when compared with those of the holoenzyme crystal structures of Mcm and metH, reveal that large parts of these B12-apoenzymes are pre-organized for B12 binding. Only a large segment of GlmS and MutS [21], each containing the conserved and `regulatory' residues His16 and Asp14, is dynamically disordered in the two apoproteins. This segment of GlmS and MutS is likely to be extensively (re)structured upon binding of coenzyme B12 and upon interacting with the substrate activating subunit GlmE (or MutE) in the complete mutases. GlmS and MutS accordingly represent a type of an incomplete `Rossmann' fold that apparently is characteristic of B12-binding proteins that bind their corrinoid cofactor in a baseoff/His-on form. Clearly, another situation is likely to be found in those B12-binding proteins that bind their corrinoid cofactor in a base-on form (i.e. with the nucleotide base coordinated to Co) such as diol dehydratases [11,53] and B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductases [54].
