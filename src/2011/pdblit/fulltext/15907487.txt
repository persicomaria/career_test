Rab-Subfamily-Specific Regions of Ypt7p Are Structurally Different from Other RabGTPases
Alexandru-Tudor Constantinescu,2 Alexey Rak,2 Kirill Alexandrov, Heike Esters, Roger S. Goody, and Axel J. Scheidig1 Abteilung fur Physikalische Biochemie ¨ Max-Planck Institut fur Molekulare Physiologie ¨ Otto-Hahn Strasse 11 44227 Dortmund Germany In common with all Ras-related GTPases, Ypt proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. In the GDP-bound state, Ypt proteins are predominantly cytosolic, solubilized through the interaction with a protein known as GDP dissociation inhibitor (Gdi1p or Sec19p in yeast nomenclature [7]). In the GTP-bound state, the proteins are membrane bound and interact with specific partner proteins, termed effectors [8, 9]. It is believed that the nucleotide state of the Ypt proteins is one of the key factors determining the correct localization (both spatially and temporarily) of effector proteins and that fidelity of the vesicular transport machinery is based on the concentration ratio of their GTP- and GDP-bound states. The GTP/GDP transition is controlled by the interplay between two major classes of proteins: the GTPase-activating proteins (generically termed GAPs, or Gyps for Ypt proteins) on the one hand, and the nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), able to stimulate the exchange of GDP with GTP, on the other hand. The common key feature of Ypt/Rab proteins appears to be the activation and/or recruitment of specific effector molecules to their sites of action (for recent reviews see [9] and [10]). Mutant Ypt/Rab proteins locked in the GDP state inhibit vesicular fusion, whereas most mutants locked in the GTP state are able to enhance the rate of fusion [11]. What is striking in the Ypt family is the very high specificity with respect to their target compartments and their effectors, in spite of the high sequence homology between the members of the family. Construction of chimeras between different Rab proteins [12] or Ypt proteins [13, 14], followed by their in vivo characterization, gave first hints on the structural determinants for the Rab/ Ypt specificity. A recent extensive sequence analysis study of Rab proteins identified the presence of five Rab-family-specific amino acid stretches, termed RabF regions, which cluster in and around switch regions I and II that are present in GTP-binding proteins. Four other regions, termed RabSF regions, have been highlighted, which can be used to define ten subfamilies of Rab GTPases [15]. However, a more detailed understanding would come from comparing experimentally determined structures of different Ypt/Rab proteins alone, or, even better, in complex with their effectors. In this respect, the crystal structure of the active conformation of Rab3a in complex with the specific effector protein Rabphilin3 [16], gave first insights into the manner in which Rab proteins are specifically recognized by cognate effector proteins. This complex revealed three Rab complementarity-determining regions (termed RabCDRs I, II, and III) that superimpose well with the later defined RabF and RabSF regions derived from the sequence analysis study [15]. Ypt7p is one of the 11 members of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ypt family. Although the gene is not essential, its deletion leads to vacuole fragmentation and defective

Summary The GTPase Ypt7p from S. cerevisiae is involved in late endosome-to-vacuole transport and homotypic vacuole fusion. We present crystal structures of the GDP- and GppNHp-bound conformation of Ypt7p ° solved at 1.35 and 1.6 A resolution, respectively. Despite the similarity of the overall structure to other Ypt/Rab proteins, Ypt7p displays small but significant differences. The Ypt7p-specific residues Tyr33 and Tyr37 cause a difference in the main chain trace of the RabSF2 region and form a characteristic surface epitope. Ypt7p·GppNHp does not display the helix 2, characteristic of the Ras-superfamily, but instead possess an extended loop L4/L5. Due to insertions in loops L3 and L7, the neighboring RabSF1 and RabSF4 regions are different in their conformations to those of other Ypt/Rab proteins. Introduction All eukaryotic cells contain multiple membrane-bound compartments. The membranes limiting these organelles are impermeable to biological macromolecules, and, as a consequence, transport of components between different compartments is achieved using small transport vesicles via budding, vectorial transport, and specific membrane fusion. Ras-related GTPases are small (ca. 20 kDa) monomeric proteins controlling a multitude of cellular processes, from signal transduction and cell proliferation to nuclear import and vesicular transport [1]. The small GTPases termed Ypt in yeast and Rab in higher eukaryotes are one of the key components of the transport machinery, with current evidence suggesting that they contribute to the specificity of vesicle targeting [2]. Ypt/ Rab proteins form the largest subfamily of the Rassuperfamily, accounting for about one-third of its members in yeast [3]. Each Ypt protein is localized to the membrane of specific intracellular compartments and is highly specific for a particular transport step [4]. Membrane attachment is mediated by two geranylgeranyl moieties posttranslationally linked to the C terminus (reviewed in [5, 6]).

transport to the lysosome [17]. This and other data suggest that Ypt7p is involved in late endosome-to-vacuole transport as well as in homotypic vacuole fusion [18] mediated by a large multiprotein complex termed class C-Vps complex [19] and HOPS [20], respectively, which specifically interact with the GTP-bound form of Ypt7p. Although the generic differences between the GTPand GDP-bound states are known [21], small variations among several Ypt/Rab proteins in the same nucleotidebound state are crucial for their function. Therefore, the determination of their individual structures at high resolution is needed for a detailed understanding. With this in mind, we crystallized and solved the structure of Ypt7p in the GTP- and GDP-bound forms. According to the view that Ypt/Rab proteins act as molecular switches[1], their effector proteins should recognize regions that alter their conformation upon GTP hydrolysis (switch regions I and II). Furthermore, the specificity of the different effectors toward particular Ypt proteins also requires structural specificity markers for each Ypt protein. In the present study, comparison of the GTPand GDP-bound conformations of a C-terminally truncated version of Ypt7p provides insight into those regions that display nucleotide-dependent conformations, as well as additional regions thought to be responsible for the Ypt7p specificity. Results Design and Crystallization of the Protein For crystallization and determination of the three-dimensional structure of Ypt7p in the GDP-bound and the GTP-

bound forms, we have used two different C-terminally truncated constructs of Ypt7p. Based mainly on results obtained with Rab7 [22], we first decided to shorten Ypt7p by 10 residues. With the Ypt7p C10 construct, we were able to crystallize the 1:1 complex with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GppNHp. The crystals belong to space group P61 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and ° diffract to a minimum Bragg spacing of 2.1 A (see Table 1). The phase determination was performed by molecular replacement using the coordinates of truncated Ypt51p·GppNHp (PDB entry code 1EK0 [23]) as a starting model. The partial refinement of this crystal structure revealed that the first 6 residues (1­6) and the last 11 residues (188­198) were disordered and not defined by electron density. Crystal packing analysis indicated that residues from switch I were clashing with residues from switch II of a neighboring molecule. Moreover, the C-terminal tail of a third molecule seemed to be interposed between the switch regions of the first two molecules. Therefore, the refinement of the structural model was stopped at that early stage (statistics of the partially refined model are given in Table 1), since it was clear that it would not have provided structural information on the most interesting parts of the molecule, namely the switch regions and the N and C termini. Based on these observations and the comparison with recent crystal structures of Rab3a (visible residues 18­ 186 [24]) and Ypt51p (visible residues 5­175 [23]), a new construct lacking the last 26 residues of Ypt7p was designed, termed Ypt7p C26. With this second construct, we were able to obtain crystals in complex with

GppNHp as well as with GDP, both of them in the space group P212121. Despite the fact that the protein and the space group were the same, the crystals obtained for the two forms had different cell dimensions and crystal packing. Structure Determination We solved and refined the structure of Ypt7p C26·GppNHp using diffraction data extending to a mini° mum Bragg spacing of 1.6 A, with an Rfree of 23.9% and an Rworking of 18.3%. The structure of Ypt7p C26·GDP ° was refined to 1.35 A resolution with an Rfree of 25.3% and an Rworking of 20.1%, respectively. The phase determination was performed by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the partially refined structure of Ypt7p C10·GppNHp (see above) without the bound nucleotide, magnesium ion, and water molecules. The final refined model includes residues 2­182 for the GppNHp case and residues 7­181 for the GDP form lacking residues 38­41 (part of loop L2) and residues 67­77 (part of loop L4/5), one nucleotide, one magnesium ion, and, respectively, 240- (GppNHp) and 172- (GDP) ordered water molecules. The data and refinement statistics are given in Table 2 (Ypt7p C26·GppNHp) and Table 3 (Ypt7p C26·GDP). The refinement for the structural model of Ypt7p C10·GppNHp was not completed (see Table 1) since it would not have provided the desired detailed information on important parts of the molecule. Overall Structure Ypt7p displays a fold similar to that of other Ras-related small GTPases, consisting of a core formed by six sheet

strands surrounded by helices. However, there are only four (and not five, as usual) helices since helix 2 is structurally disorganized (see Figure 1). Ypt7p has essentially the same main chain trace as other Ypt/Rab proteins including the glycine-induced bulge at the end of the effector loop, L2, first described by Dumas et al. [24]. The conformational differences between the structure of Ypt7p C26·GppNHp and the structures of Rab3a·GppNHp, Ypt51p·GppNHp, and Sec4p·GppNHp are small but significant. In order to present and discuss these differences, we will refer primarily to the highresolution structure of Ypt51p·GppNHp, since both proteins come from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are involved in the endocytic pathways of vesicular transport, and control linked steps in membrane transport. Therefore, they might be localized on the same organelle in their activity cycle. Hence, despite the fact that they have some interacting proteins in common (the components of the prenylation machinery, Gdi1p, etc.), they have to be able to differentiate between specific binding partners. As an example, GDP release from Ypt7p cannot be stimulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vps9p, which is an exchange factor for Ypt51p [25, 26]. The major differences in the main chain trace occur at the N and C termini--residues 3­9 and 172­182-- (throughout the text, the residue numbering will be that of Ypt7p, unless otherwise stated), the turn L3 between strands 2 and 3 (residues 49­59), the loop region L7 between helix 3 and strand 5 (residues 110­ 119), and the tight turn L9 between helix 4 and strand 6 (residues 148­151) (see Figure 2). In Ypt7p,

the turn L3 and L9 have one residue inserted, and the loop L7 four, compared with Ypt51p (see Figure 1B). These differences in the size of the loops, taken together with the differences in the amino acid sequence, explain very well their observed conformational differences. These loops are on the same side of the protein as the N and C termini (of the crystallized, truncated construct), together forming a characteristic epitope on the side opposite to the nucleotide binding pocket of the protein (see Figures 2 and 3). The differences are Ypt7p specific, since the comparison between Ypt51p [23], Sec4p [21], Rab3a [24], and Rab5c [27] reveal much less variation in the main chain trace for these discussed regions. Furthermore, the electrostatic surface potential of this area does not display large positively or negatively charged patches as is usually the case for membraneinteracting protein surfaces [28] (see Figure 3). Based on these observations, it seems unlikely that this surface is oriented toward the negatively charged membrane surface at which Ypt/Rab proteins are anchored, but it could be accessible for specific interacting proteins. The interface between the switch I and switch II regions displays significant differences in the main chain trace as well as in the side chain orientations compared with the described structures of rat Rab3a, mouse Rab5c, yeast Ypt51p, and yeast Sec4p. The structural plasticity in this region was first highlighted by Merithew et al. [27] in mouse Rab5c. This interface is mainly determined by the interaction of three aromatic amino acid side chains. Phenylalanine at position 45 and trypto-

phane at position 63 are absolutely conserved in all members of the Ypt/Rab family. The last residue of this hydrophobic triad (at position 78) is phenylalanine in Ypt7p and Rab7, whereas it is tyrosine in all other Ypt/ Rab family members. The side chain of Phe78 in Ypt7p·GppNHp is oriented toward the interior of the protein, whereas the tyrosines at the corresponding position are oriented toward the surface of the respective Ypt/Rab protein (see Figure 4). As a consequence, the main chain trace between residues 42 and 45 of Ypt7p displays a different trace compared with all other Ypt/ Rab protein structures. The main chain trace is shifted ° around 2 A toward the switch II region, displaying the maximum shift at the position of Ala43. Together with slightly different side chain orientations of the amino acids Phe45 and Trp63, this feature is further evidence for the structural plasticity of the RabF2/RabF3/RabF4 epitope. A striking feature is the extended loop L4 that starts at position Ala66 and ends at position Gly81. In all other known structures of Ypt/Rab proteins and other members of the Ras superfamily, this region contains a welldefined helix ( 2). In contrast, the region between residues 73 and 78 of Ypt7p·GppNHp is in an extended loop conformation and not in the helical conformation adopted by the corresponding residues of other structurally characterized small GTP-binding proteins (see Figures 1 and 5). We believe that this is not a crystallographic artifact for two reasons. First, the observed crystal packing interactions in the P212121 crystal form do not

Figure 1. Ribbon Representation and Sequence Alignment of the Ypt7p·GppNHp Structure (A) Secondary structure elements were determined by the program DSSP [42]. Since in the Ypt7p·GppNHp structure the helix 2 is missing, the loops L4 and L5 are forming one extended loop. The RabF and RabSF regions [15] were mapped on the Ypt7p sequence and are highlighted. RabF regions are depicted blue, RabSF regions in red. The regions corresponding to the three complementarity-determining regions of Rab3a [16] are labeled as CDR1-3.

Only residues visible in the crystal structures are included. For comparison, the sequence and secondary structure elements of H-Ras p21 are included. The sequence alignment was performed with ClustalW [43], manually adjusted to fit secondary structure elements and the final figure prepared with ESPript [44]. Despite the missing helix 2 in Ypt7p (indicated by green dots), the secondary structure elements are labeled according to the general fold of small GTP-binding proteins. The red dots at the end of the RabSF4 label indicate that this region extends till the C-terminal end of the full-length protein.

seem to induce the loss of a potential helical structure. Secondly, the respective region could also not be traced in the P61 crystal form (see Experimental Procedures). However, in the P61 crystal form, the two switch regions of two neighboring molecules were facing and possibly disturbing each other. This suggests two hypotheses: either the helix was partly unstructured before crystal contacts were created, and the extended loop could fit in various positions; or the helix was actively unwound during the crystallization. It seems to be less probable that the crystallization-promoting forces would be

strong enough to actively drive the melting of a helix unless it is intrinsically unstable. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation over a time period of 4000 ps with a modeled helix 2 reveals that only this helical section becomes unstructured, whereas all other helices and sheets stay stable (data not shown). Therefore, the lack of a helical structure from the beginning seems to be most likely. The observed extended loop might be a consequence of the different packing between the above-described aromatic amino acids Phe45, Trp63, and Phe78. In par-

ticular, the orientation of Phe78 prevents this loop from adopting a helical backbone conformation (Figure 4). Therefore, in addition to amino acids of the RabF2/ RabF4 epitope, the amino acids of the RabF3 epitope display significantly different orientations. These described structural differences contribute to a substantial difference in the charge distributions and surface topology of Ypt7p, and most probably of Rab7, in view of the sequence identity between Ypt7p and Rab7. In the structure of Ypt7p bound to GDP, the electron density in this area is poor and does not allow confident tracing of the amino acids of the switch I (residues 38­41) and switch II (residues 67­77) regions. The switch II region becomes ordered at the well-defined residue Phe78, which in concert with Tyr79 is involved in hydrophobic interactions that include the conserved Trp63. Particular Side Chain Conformations Tyr33 is localized on top of the guanine base forming an edge-to-face interaction with it. In most members of the Ras superfamily, this residue is a phenylalanine (residue Phe28 in H-Ras p21). Comparison with Ypt51p, Sec4p, Rab3a, and Rab5c reveals that the aromatic rings of phenylalanine, and the corresponding tyrosine, overlap. However, the guanine base and the ribose sugar moiety of the bound nucleotide is slightly shifted and turned in the case of Ypt7p (see Figure 6), while keeping the - and -phosphate at the same positions. The side

chain hydroxy group of Tyr33 forms a hydrogen bond ° with the nucleotide sugar oxygen O2 (d 2.8 A) and ° with the side chain OE1/NE2 (d 2.9 A) of Gln35. Both side chain atoms of Gln35, OE1/NE2, are also involved ° in hydrogen bonding with Lys160-NZ (d 3.1 A). The same interactions are seen in the GDP form of Ypt7p. In both structures, the GXP base plane is tilted by about 11.3 compared with the position of the guanine-nucleotide base in other well-defined structures. Tyr37 of Ypt7p (equivalent to Tyr32 of H-Ras p21) is oriented away from the bound nucleotide, similar to Lys36 of Ypt51p [23] and Gln50 in Rab5c [27]. Thus, it does not interact with the GTP, but it forms a hydrogen bond between its side chain hydroxy group and the side chain of His26, creating part of a hydrophobic surface patch. However, the corresponding pair in Ypt51p and Rab5c (Leu25/Lys36 and Leu39/Gln50, respectively) contains a hydrophobic and a charged residue. Tyr37 does not adopt a conformation facing the solvent and covering the nucleotide binding pocket, as observed for Phe51 in Rab3a and Phe49 in Sec4p (see Figure 7). This might indicate a conformational difference between Ypt/ Rab proteins of the endocytic pathway and those of the exocytic pathway. Following this rationale, we expect the above described conformational difference in the switch I region to be shared with Ypt1p and Rab1a, since both these proteins have tyrosines at the same position. The above-described aromatic residues at positions

In the GDP form (highlighted in magenta), these residues are superimposed with transparent van der Waals spheres. In the GppNHp form, the extended loop L4 and the side chains of the aromatic residues are colored in green. For clarity, the short helix 2 of Sec4p is represented as a coil. In Ypt7p·GDP the residues 67­76 are not visible and are missing in the figure.

33 and 37 determine a significant variation in the surface topology when compared with Ypt51p. In addition, the three isoforms of Ypt5p (Ypt51p, Ypt52p, and Ypt53p) have a positively charged residue at position 37, and therefore the charge distribution of this surface patch is significantly changed. These two features might form an important determinant for specificity of binding partners for Ypt5Xp versus Ypt7p, enabling specific effectors to discriminate between Ypt7p and Ypt5Xp. Differences between the GDP and GppNHp Forms The GppNHp- and the GDP-bound form of Ypt7p C26 can be very well superimposed. The rms deviation for ° 162 C positions is 0.657 A with the major differences

seen in the switch I and switch II regions. A small but significant difference in the main chain trace can be observed for the tight turn L3 ( 2/ 3) including residues Val50 to Lys54. GTP to GDP hydrolysis leads to the loss of the -phosphate group and, as a direct consequence, two hydrogen bonds, between O1G and the amide hydrogen atom of Thr40 (part of loop L2) and between O2G and the amide hydrogen atom of Gly67 (part of loop L4), are lost. These are both considered to be important interactions. These changes lead to large structural rearrangements of the loops L2 and L4. In the switch I region, residues Glu36 to Phe45 are displaced ° ° by more than 1A. The largest displacement, of 8.7 A, is observed for Ile41. Furthermore, residues 38­40 could not be traced at all in the electron density of Ypt7p C26·GDP. Therefore, in Ypt7p the "switch I" region extends from residues 36 to 45, which is in accordance with the switch I region in Ras-p21 (residues 30­38) and Sec4p (residues 48­56). The second region which undergoes significant rearrangements upon GTP hydrolysis is the extended loop

compared with Sec4p. This is mostly due to a hydrophobic interaction between Trp63 and Phe78, which pack in an "edge-to-face" manner in the GTP state and in a "face-to-face" mode in the GDP case, providing an "anchor point" for the loop. The corresponding residues in Sec4p (Trp74 and Tyr89) are too far apart to interact (see Figure 4). Discussion We have presented the high-resolution crystal structures of Ypt7p in the GDP- and the GTP-bound conformations. In order to obtain well-diffracting crystals for both states, we have used Ypt7p C10 for initial crystallization trials. Based on its preliminary crystal structure in complex with GppNHp, we further tailored the protein by removing all the flexible or unstructured C-terminal amino acids after the last helix. The presented differences in main chain and side chain conformations of Ypt7p compared with Ypt51p, Sec4p, Rab3a, and Rab5c, in addition to the sequence differences, contribute to the structural plasticity and the variations in both the surface charge distribution and surface topology within the Ypt/Rab family of proteins. The observed structural differences are clustered in areas which were recently highlighted as Rab-specific or Rab subfamily-specific regions [15]. For the RabSF2 region (part of the switch I region), Ypt7p displays, in the GTP-bound form, a shifted conformation when compared with other Ypt/Rab structures and a different surface topology, mainly as a consequence of the two tyrosine residues Tyr33 and Tyr37. In the structure of Ypt7p·GppNHp, helix 2 is unwound, which results in an extended loop spanning from strand 3 to 4,

The nucleotide GppNHp and the side chain of Ypt7p-Tyr33 and Ypt51pPhe32, respectively, are represented in ball-and-stick. The C position of the neighbored residues are indicated by spheres and labeled in green (Ypt7p) and blue (Ypt51p), respectively.

L4. Residues 67­77 could not be traced in the electron density of Ypt7p C26·GDP, whereas residues Thr65, Ala66, and Phe78 to Gly81 have rms deviations above ° 1.0 A when comparing the GDP structure with the GTP structure. The switch II region appears to be slightly smaller than the corresponding region in Sec4p (equivalent residues would have been Thr65 to Ala82). Due to the fact that in the GTP form, Ypt7p displays an extended loop L4, the degree of rearrangement is smaller in Ypt7p

Overlay following the superposition of the nucleotide atoms (GppNHp) displayed in ball-and-stick representation (in grey). The amino acids from residues 33­41 (Ypt7p) and from 45­53 (Sec4p) are shown in ball-and-stick representation. Residues of Ypt7p are labeled in green and those of Sec4p in blue. The Sec4p model in this figure was generated from the coordinates of the GppNHp-bound form of Sec4p [21]. The differences in the electrostatic surface potential are represented in the lower panel. The molecular surface colored according to the electrostatic potential was calculated with the program GRASP [39].

including the RabF3 region. MD simulations revealed that the intrinsic sequence of Ypt7p within this region determines this feature. These two conformational changes associated with the switch I and the switch II region are likely to contribute to Ypt7p-specific binding of effector proteins and presumably help to discriminate between Ypt7p and Ypt51p when they are located on the same membrane. Furthermore, due to insertions in loops L3 and L7, the neighboring RabSF1 and RabSF4 regions are different in their conformation compared with other Ypt/Rab proteins. Therefore, it is probable that this surface patch can serve as an additional binding site for Ypt7p-specific effector proteins. These variations, each taken in part, are small, but they add up and most probably become a specificity tag allowing differentiation between the otherwise sequence- and fold-similar Ypt/Rab proteins. It is a common feature that the GDP-bound form of Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins has a less welldefined structure than the GTP-bound form. In particular, the important switch I and switch II regions are very flexible when the protein is in complex with GDP, lacking the -phosphate group that stabilizes these regions. This higher conformational mobility in the GDP-bound form might help proteins that interact promiscuously with Ypt/Rab proteins in the GDP-bound form to overcome variations in the amino acid sequence and topology at the interaction surface (e.g., GDP dissociation inhibitor [GDI] [7]).

specific effector Rabphilin3a and a more recent extensive sequence analysis of all known Rab proteins indicated that different regions are characteristic for the Rab superfamily and for the Rab subfamilies. Based on the structural comparison of Ypt7p with different Ypt/ Rab proteins, it is evident that some sequence regions for the subfamilies derived for mammalian Rab proteins match very well with regions of Ypt7p that display significant structural variations (e.g., L7 and the N- and C-terminal regions). However, there are further regions which have not been highlighted so far (e.g., L3 and L8). In addition, the presented structures of Ypt7p in the GTP- and GDP-bound states will help to rationalize observed properties of Ypt7p mutants. For further elucidation of the structural determinants, more solved threedimensional structures are needed, especially of complexes between Ypt/Rab proteins and different binding partners.
Experimental Procedures Cloning, Expression, and Purification Cloning of truncated versions of Ypt7p was as follows: in order to obtain the first Ypt7p truncation mutant, PCR with degenerated primers was performed on the original plasmid pET11a Ypt7 kindly provided by Dieter Gallwitz (Gottingen). The 5 primer was the stan¨ dard T7 promoter primer (catalogue no. 69348-3; Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) and the 3 primer had the sequence 5 -ATTTTCGGAT CCTTAGCGAATA-3 , containing a BamHI restriction site (bold) and a STOP codon (underlined). Both the amplicon and the pET11aYPT7 vector were cut with NdeI (which contains the start codon for YPT7) and BamHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, and, respectively, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) and relegated (T4 DNA ligase; Promega, Madison, WI). The vector obtained this way was called pET11aYPT7 C10. The protein encoded by this vector was referred to as Ypt7p C10. For the second truncation, another round of PCR with degenerated primers was performed on pET11aYPT7 C10; the 5 primer was again the T7 promoter primer, and the 3 primer was 5 -CGGAT CCTCGAGTTAAGCTTGATTCTG-3 ; it contained a BamHI and a premature STOP codon (underlined). The PCR amplicon was inserted in pET11aYPT7 C10, based on the strategy outlined above, yielding pET11aYPT7 C26. The protein encoded by this vector is referred to as Ypt7p C26. Both constructs were checked for errors in the coding region by nucleotide sequencing (BigDye terminator kit; PE Applied Biosystems). The protocol for expression and purification was the same for both Ypt7p constructs. The plasmid was transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and colonies were selected on LB-agarose plates with 125 g/ml ampicillin (or carbenicillin). Recombinant protein expression from 5l of LB media (125 g/ml ampicillin) was induced with 400 M IPTG at an OD600 of about 0.7. After 5 hr at 37 C, the cells were harvested (20 min, 3000 g at 4 C) and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM TRIS [pH 8.0], 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaN3, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mM DTE). Cells were disrupted using a fluidizer (Microfluidics, MA), and the lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation (60 min, 100,000 g at 4 C). The supernatant was loaded onto a 400 ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM TRIS [pH 8.0], 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTE). After extensive washing, elution was achieved with a linear gradient of 0%­90% buffer B (buffer A plus 450 mM NaCl) in 6.5 column volumes. Fractions containing Ypt7p were pooled (200 ml of approximately 65%­70% purity, Coomassie staining of an SDS-PAGE) and brought to 70% ammonium sulphate saturation. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 g and 4 C, resuspended in gel-filtration buffer (20 mM TRIS [pH 8.0], 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTE, and 25 M GDP) and loaded onto a Superdex G75 26/60 gel-filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions containing pure (more than 95%, judged by SDSPAGE and Coomassie staining) Ypt7p were pooled and concen-

Biological Implications The common key feature of Ypt/Rab proteins is believed to be the recruitment and/or activation of specific effector molecules that bind exclusively to the GTP-bound form. On the one hand, Ypt/Rab proteins share a group of binding partners that do not bind other members of the Ras-superfamily, and on the other hand, individual Ypt/Rab proteins have their specific binding partners. High-resolution crystal structures of representative members of the Ypt/Rab family are needed in order to understand the crucial structural determinants for this binding selectivity and specificity; the small variations between the members of the Ypt/Rab family cannot yet be predicted with high accuracy, making structure determination the sole way of solving the problem. We have determined and compared the crystal structure of the active (GTP-bound) form and the inactive (GDP-bound) form of the GTPase Ypt7p from S. cerevisiae. By comparison with the crystal structures of other members of the Ypt/ Rab family in the GTP-bound state, we highlighted further structural variations in the switch I and switch II regions. Other regions which display significant conformational differences within the Ypt/Rab-family could be identified within the N- and the C-terminal regions as well as the loop regions L3 ( 2­ 3), L4/L5 ( 3­ 4), L7 ( 3­ 5), and L8 ( 5­ 4). It is most probable that these regions together with the switch regions are responsible for the specificity of effector binding. Although Ypt7p displays the common fold of all small GTP-binding proteins, helix 2 is replaced by an extended loop (L4/L5). The structure of the complex between Rab3a and its

trated in a Centriprep concentrator with a 10 kDa cutoff (Amicon, Millipore) to about 10 mg/ml. Nucleotide exchange was performed as described in [29]. Briefly, 36 mg of protein was incubated with a 10-fold M excess of GppNHp in the presence of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (100 I.U. per M GTPase) in a buffer containing 50 mM TRIS (pH 8.5), 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, 5 mM DTT, and 10 M ZnCl2 at room temperature. Excess GppNHp, as well as guanosine, were removed by passing the reaction mixture through a NAP5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the gel filtration buffer but without GDP. Nucleotide content and reaction progress was checked by HPLC. Crystallization All crystallization trials were performed at 20 C in hanging-drop geometry. Crystallization droplets consisted of equal amounts of protein solution (7­9 mg/ml) mixed with reservoir solution. Reservoir volume was 750 l in the case of GppNHp trials and 500 l in the case of GDP trials. GppNHp crystals appeared in 1­2 days and growth was finished after 3­5 days. GDP crystals were completely grown in 1­2 days. Ypt7p C10·GppNHp Crystals Ypt7p C10·GppNHp crystals were first obtained using a screen based on the Hampton Research sparse-matrix screen 1. Initial conditions (0.1 M Tris HCl [pH 8.5] and 2M (NH4)2HPO4) yielded hexagonal, rod-shaped crystals of about 30 30 100 m3 , which exhibited dendritic growth (a tree-like disorder at the growing end) ° and diffracted usually up to 3 A d-spacing on an in-house X-ray ° source. Better-diffracting crystals (minimum d-spacing 2.0 A, but still manifesting dendritic growth) were obtained in 0.1 M Tris HCl (pH 8.5) and 2.2M (NH4)2HPO4. All crystals were shortly (5­10 s) soaked in cryo-protectant (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.5], 2 M (NH4)2HPO4, and 20% glycerol) and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Attempts to obtain crystals of the GDP-loaded Ypt7p C10 protein were unsuccessful. Ypt7p C26·GDP Crystals First crystals of Ypt7p C26·GDP were found in 20% PEG 3350, 200 mM NaCl. Further efforts to improve crystal quality led to crystals ° able to diffract up to 1.3 A. For these crystals, conditions were 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0), 1 M LiCl, and 21% PEG 6K. For data collection, the crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. 10% glycerol in reservoir solution, perfluorinated mineral oil, or microscopy immersion oil were used as cryo-protectants. Ypt7p C26·GppNHp Crystals Ypt7p C26·GppNHp crystals were found in conditions similar to the GDP ones, namely 1 M LiCl, 20%­30% PEG 6K over a wide pH range: 0.1 M of citrate (pH 5.0), MES (pH 6.0), HEPES (pH 7.0), TRIS (pH 8.0), or Bicine (pH 9.0). Fine tuning the conditions yielded rodshaped crystals of about 80 80 100 m3 which were grown using 0.1 M Bicine (pH 9.0), 1 M LiCl, and 25% PEG 3350. These ° crystals were able to diffract up to 1.57 A. For data collection, the crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen without the addition of a cryo-protectant. Data Collection and Processing For all three crystal forms, a first data set was collected in house using Cu K radiation generated with an Enraf-Nonius rotating anode FR591 equipped with mirror optics (Supper Inc., Madison) and a MAR345 image plate detector. The data sets collected this way were used for space group determination, molecular replacement tests, and initial refinements. For Ypt7p C10·GppNHp, a first complete data set was collected at the EMBL-beamline BW7B (DESY, Hamburg) and a second, highresolution data set was collected on the microfocus beamline ID13 at EMBL/ESRF Grenoble, using a MAR CCD detector. For the Ypt7p C26·GppNHp crystals and Ypt7p C26·GDP crystals, the beamline ID14-1 at ESRF Grenoble was used; data were collected using a MAR CCD detector. All data processing and reduction was performed using XDS/XSCALE [30]. Data collection and processing statistics are given in Tables 1­3. Phasing and Refinement The determination of the phases for the Ypt7p C10·GppNHp crystal was achieved using molecular replacement as implemented in the

program AMoRe [31]. A usable molecular replacement solution could be found using Ypt51p·GppNHp (PDB entry code 1EK0 [23]) as a starting model. The Ypt7p C26 crystals were phased using the partially built Ypt7p C10 model. Initial refinement was performed using CNS [32]. High-resolution refinement was performed against Is using SHELX97 [33]. The same set of free-R-flagged reflections [34] was used in both programs (CNS and SHELX). For Ypt7p C26·GDP in the refinement with SHELX, anisotropic displacement was modeled. After each refinement round, the model was checked and rebuilt against A-weighted maps; map display and model rebuilding was done in the program O [35]. Final model analysis was performed using the program Swiss PDB Viewer [36]. Images were created using the programs MolScript [37], BobScript [38], and GRASP [39] and rendered with Raster3D [40] or POV-Ray (http://www.povray.org).
