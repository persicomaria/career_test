ABSTRACT: The three-dimensional structure of oryzacystatin-I, a cysteine proteinase inhibitor of the rice, Oryza satiVa L. japonica, has been determined in solution at pH 6.8 and 25 °C by 1H and 15N NMR spectroscopy. The main body (Glu13-Asp97) of oryzacystatin-I is well-defined and consists of an R-helix and a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet, while the N- and C-terminal regions (Ser2-Val12 and Ala98Ala102) are less defined. The helix-sheet architechture of oryzacystatin-I is stabilized by a hydrophobic cluster formed between the R-helix and the -sheet and is considerably similar to that of monellin, a sweet-tasting protein from an African berry, as well as those of the animal cystatins studied, e.g., chicken egg white cystatin and human stefins A and B (also referred to as human cystatins A and B). Detailed structural comparison indicates that oryzacystatin-I is more similar to chicken cystatin, which belongs to the type-2 animal cystatins, than to human stefins A and B, which belong to the type-1 animal cystatins, despite different loop length.

Cysteine proteinase inhibitors are widely distributed in mammals, plants, and insects and may function to protect cells from unwanted proteolysis and to control intra- and extracellular protein breakdown. The cystatin superfamily consists of tightly and reversibly binding inhibitors against cysteine proteinases of the papain family. The cystatin superfamily in higher animals can be divided into three types based on the molecular mass and the presence of disulfide bonds (1-3). Type 1 animal cystatins have ca. 100 amino acids, lack disulfide bonds, and are present predominantly intracellularly. Type 2 animal cystatins have ca. 120 amino acids, contain at least two characteristic disulfide bonds, and are found extracellularly, in body fluids. Type 3 animal cystatins are larger glycoproteins containing several type 2-like cystatin domains. The cysteine proteinase inhibitors from plants that show amino acid sequence similarity to the animal cystatins are referred to as the phytocystatins (4). Oryzacystatin is the first well-defined phytocystatin (4-9). It occurs in the endosperm of the rice Oryza satiVa L. japonica and has potent inhibitory activity against papain (EC 3.4.22.2) and several other cysteine proteinases. It is similar to the type 1 animal cystatins in that it consists of 102 amino acids and lacks disulfide bonds.

Thus far, the crystal structures of human stefin B (also referred to as cystatin B) complexed with carboxymethylated papain (CM1-papain) (10) and chicken egg white cystatin (11) and the solution structures of human stefin A (also referred to as cystatin A) (12, 13) and chicken egg white cystatin (14) have been reported. These structures have shown that the types 1 and 2 animal cystatins studied share a common fold consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet that wraps around a central R-helix. In the crystal structure of human stefin B-CM-papain complex, a wedgeshaped edge of human stefin B, formed by the two tight -hairpin loops and the N-terminal region, slots into the active-site cleft of papain to achieve the tight binding (10). The first binding loop (L1) contains the highly conserved Gln-Xaa-Val-Xaa-Gly motif (Xaa represents any amino acid), the second binding loop (L2) contains an aromatic residue, Trp or His, and the third contact point, referred to as the N-terminal trunk (NT), contains a conserved Gly residue (3). Because all of the three structural motifs are present in oryzacystatin-I, it would inhibit papain in a similar manner. In fact, the mutation in L1 and the deletion of L2 both lead to significant loss in the papain-inhibitory activity of oryzacystatin-I (15), but the NT seems to be of relatively low importance for papain inhibition by oryzacystatin-I (16, 17).

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of cysteine proteinase inhibition by oryzacystatin-I, we have determined its solution structure at pH 6.8 and 25 °C by 1H and 15N NMR spectroscopy and compared the structure with those of animal cystatins. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sample Preparation. Recombinant oryzacystatin-I was overproduced by use of the expression vector pET-26b(+) and the host Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (18). M9 minimal media containing 15N-labeled NH4Cl (99.4% 15N; Shokotsusho, Tokyo) were used for the production of 15N-labeled oryzacystatin-I. The oryzacystatin-I produced in E. coli was purified from the cell extract by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by hydrophobic, anion exchange and size exclusion chromatographies with RESOURCE PHE, RESOURCE Q, and Superdex 75 columns (Pharmacia). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis showed that the heterologously produced oryzacystatin-I lacked the N-terminal Met and consisted of 101 amino acid residues. The purified oryzacystatin-I was concentrated with Centrisart ultracentrifugation tubes (Sartorius). The sample for NMR measurements contained 2-3 mM oryzacystatin-I dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate/100 mM NaCl/0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, in 10% 2H2O/90% H2O. NMR Spectroscopy. NMR data were collected at 25 °C on a Unity Inova 500-MHz spectrometer (Varian) equipped with a triple resonance probe with z-axis pulsed field

gradients (Varian, Nalorac). Quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions of homonuclear and heteronuclear spectra was achieved using States (19) and States-TPPI (20), respectively. DQF-COSY (21), TOCSY (mixing time, 45 ms) (22), and NOESY (mixing time, 150 or 75 ms) (23) spectra of unlabeled oryzacystatin-I were recorded with a timedomain data size of 512 × 1024 complex points, t1max (1H) 73.1 ms, t2max (1H) 146.7 ms. In the homonuclear NMR measurements, the water resonance was suppressed by presaturation (24). 1H-15N HSQC (25, 26), 1H-1H-15N TOCSYHSQC (mixing time, 49 or 33 ms) (27), NOESY-HSQC (mixing time, 150 or 75 ms) (28), HNHA (29), 15N T1, 15N T2, and 15N{1H}-NOE (1H saturation time, 3 s) (30) spectra of 15N-labeled oryzacystatin-I were measured with pulse sequences using sensitivity enhancement and gradient selection (26). The heteronuclear 2D spectra were recorded with a time-domain size of 64 × 352 complex points, t1max (15N) 35.6 ms, t2max (1H) 50.4 ms. The heteronuclear 3D spectra were recorded with the time-domain size of 128 × 32 × 352 complex points, t1max (1H) 23.3 ms, t2max (15N) 17.8 ms, t3max (1H) 50.4 ms. The acquired NMR data were processed, visualized, and peak-picked with the softwares, NMRPipe (ver. 1.6) (31), NMRDraw (ver. 1.6) (31)/FELIX 97 (Molecular Simulations), and PIPP/CAPP (ver. 4.0) (32), respectively, on an Octane workstation (Silicon Graphics). Determination of 15N T1 and T2 and estimation of the overall rotational correlation time were done as described (30).

NOE-DeriVed Interproton Distance Restraints. Interproton distance restraints were obtained from cross-peak intensities in the 3D 1H-1H-15N NOESY-HSQC and 2D 1H-1H NOESY with a mixing time of 75 ms. The peak intensities were translated to interproton distances based on the relation of NOE  (distance)-6 and the standard distance between HNi and HNi+1 in R-helix ) 2.8 Å (33). Upper bound distance restraints were set to the calculated distances plus 0.5 Å considering internal mobility. Lower bound distance restraints were set to the sum of van der Waals radii. Pseudoatom corrections were added to the upper bound distance restraints involving degenerate protons from methylene groups and aromatic rings (34). Torsion Angle Restraints.  angle restraints were derived from 3JHN-HR coupling constants obtained from 3D HNHA.  angle was restrained to the range of -160° to -80° for 3 JHN-HR > 8 Hz, -140° to -100° for 3JHN-HR > 9 Hz, and -90° to -40° for 3JHN-HR < 6 Hz. Stereospecific assignments of -methylene protons and 1 angle restraints were derived from semiquantitative estimates of 3JHR-H obtained from 3D 1H-1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC (33 ms mixing time) (35), NOE intensities between HN and H obtained from a 3D 1H-1H-15H NOESY-HSQC (75 ms mixing time) and NOE intensities between HR and H obtained from 2D 1H-1H NOESY (75 ms mixing time). The ranges employed for 1 angle restraints were 60 ( 50°, 180 ( 50°, and -60 ( 50°. Hydrogen-Bond Distance Restraints. Hydrogen bonds were assigned between slowly exchanging amide protons and their respective carbonyl acceptors deduced from the NOE data with reference to the hydrogen bonds in the structures of other cystatin members (10, 14) and were explicitly defined as two distance restraints between the donor and the acceptor: rHN-O ) 1.8-2.4 Å and rN-O ) 2.7-3.5 Å. The exchange rate of amide protons was estimated from the difference in intensity of 1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks in spectra recorded with and without water presaturation (36). Structure Calculations. Structure calculations were performed with the NMR-derived restraints including interproton distance restraints, hydrogen bond distance restraints, and torsion angle restraints ( and 1). One hundred random

conformers were annealed in 10 000 steps by torsion angle dynamics with the program DYANA (ver. 1.4) (37). Twenty conformers with the lowest DYANA target functions were used to represent the solution conformation of oryzacystatinI. The average coordinate of the 20 DYANA conformers was subjected to energy minimization with the acceptavecalc module in CNS (ver. 0.9) (38). Structure Analysis. Numerical analysis of the calculated structures was performed with the programs, DYANA (ver. 1.4) (37), CNS (ver. 0.9) (38), AQUA (ver. 2.0)/ PROCHECK-NMR (ver. 3.4) (39), and MOLMOL (ver. 2.6) (40). Ramachandran - plot analysis was done with PROCHECK-NMR (ver. 3.4) (39). Secondary structure was defined and tertiary structure was visualized with MOLMOL (ver. 2.6) (40). A residue was determined to be in a particular regular secondary-structure motif if it was found in that conformation in more than half of the 20 DYANA conformers. RESULTS Resonance Assignments. Spin system assignments were made with correlated cross-peaks on 2D 1H-1H DQF-COSY (21), TOCSY (50 ms mixing time) (22), and 3D 1H-1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC (49 ms mixing time) (27) spectra. Sequencespecific resonance assignments were almost completed by following NOE connectivities between HRi and HNi+1, between H i and HNi+1 and between HNi and HNi+1 on 2D 1H-1H NOESY (75 ms and 150 ms mixing time) (23) and 3D 1H-1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (75 ms and 150 ms mixing time) (28) spectra. Aromatic spin systems were connected to intraresidual -protons using 2D 1H-1H NOESY (75 and 150 ms mixing time). Figure 1 shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled oryzacystatin-I. The cross-peaks are labeled with the assignments. Secondary Structure.

NOE between HNi and HNi+1, are found in 2 (Phe44-Glu45, Leu47-Val48), and 5 (Leu90-Gln91). Structure Calculations. A total of 1383 experimentally derived restraints, consisting of 1183 interproton distance restraints (338 long-range (|i - j| g 6), 228 medium-range (2 e |i - j| e 5), 351 sequential (|i - j| ) 1) and 266 intraresidual (|i - j| ) 0)), 108 hydrogen bond restraints (representing 54 hydrogen bonds) (Figure S-1, see Supporting Information), and 92 torsion angle restraints (54  and 38 1), were obtained and used in the structure calculations by simulated annealing in torsion angle space by use of DYANA (ver. 1.4) (37). A final set of 20 structures was selected from 100 calculations on the basis of agreement with the experimental data and van der Waals' energy. The average coordinates of the 20 DYANA structures were subjected to energy minimization in Cartesian space with CNS (ver. 0.9) (38). Table S-1 summarizes the structural statistics for the 20 structures and the energy-minimized average structure of oryzacystatin-I. All the structures satisfy the experimental restraints. There are no violations in interproton distances and torsion angles greater than 0.5 Å and 2°, respectively, in these structures. The solution conformation of oryzacystatin-I is well-defined except for the N- and C-terminal regions (Ser2-Val12 and Ala98-Ala102). The pairwise atomic RMS deviations among the 20 structures is 0.65 ( 0.17 Å for the backbone heavy atoms (N, CR, C) and 1.31 ( 0.16 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms in the well-defined

region (Glu13-Asp97). Figure S-2 is the Ramachandran - plot for the well-defined region of the energyminimized structure, in which ca. 97% of the - pairs are located in the allowed regions. Figure 3 shows the number of the NOE-derived interproton distance restraints, the atomic RMS deviation, and the 15N{1H}-NOE, respectively, for each residue. Although a large number of distance restraints were obtained for the main body of the molecule (Glu13-Asp97), only a few restraints were obtained for the N-terminal (Ser2-Gly11) and Cterminal (Ala98-Ala102) regions. As a result, the conformations of the N- and C-terminal parts are less defined. The scarce 1H{1H}-NOEs, negative 15N{1H}-NOEs and less defined conformations in the terminal regions all correlate with mobility faster than the overall rotational correlation time of the molecule, which is estimated to be 7.9 ( 0.2 ns from the T1/T2 ratio (30) of the residues in regular secondary structures except the highly mobile 1 (see Figure S-3). Tertiary Structure. Figure 4, panel A shows the best-fit superposition of the backbone atoms and non-hydrogen atoms of oryzacystatin-I. The oryzacystatin-I molecule consists of a central R-helix (Leu21-Lys37) and a fivestranded antiparallel -sheet ( 1: Glu13-Val15, 2: Leu42Val54, 3: Thr58-Glu68, 4: Lys73-Lys82, and 5: Phe87-Lys94). The R-helix runs roughly perpendicular to the direction of the -strands. The -sheet is somewhat

coiled. The coiling of the inner -strands ( 3 and 4) is smooth, but that of the edge strands ( 2 and 5) are modified by the -bulges (Phe44-Glu45 and Leu47-Val48 on 2 and Leu90-Gln91 on 5), that allows them to wrap around the R-helix. The primary core of oryzacystatin-I comprises a hydrophobic cluster in the interface between the R-helix and the -sheet (Figure 4, panel B). The residues that contribute to this interface are Leu23, Val24, Leu26, Ala27, Arg28, Phe29, Ala30, Val31, His34, Asn35, Ala38 on the R-helix and Leu42, Phe44, Leu47 (on 2), Tyr60, Phe62 (on 3), Ala77, Val79, Glu81 (on 4), Lys88, Leu90, and Phe93 (on 5). Since the 15N{1H}-NOEs in 1 are nearly zero and the interstrand 1H{1H}-NOEs between 1 and 2 are weaker than those observed in the regular antiparallel

-sheet, the short N-terminal -strand ( 1: Glu13-Val15) is highly mobile and only weakly attached to 2. DISCUSSION The helix-sheet architecture of oryzacystatin-I is similar to those of the animal cystatins whose structures were solved, human stefin A (also referred to as cystatin A) (12, 13), human stefin B (also referred to as cystatin B) (10), and chicken egg white cystatin (11, 14) (Figure 5) and, in addition, to that of monellin, a sweet-tasting protein from the West African berry Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii (4143) as predicted by Murzin (44) based on the 23% amino acid sequence identity. Table 1 shows the scores of conformational similarity between oryzacystatin-I and other mem-

bers of the cystatin superfamily and monellin obtained from the DALI server (45). The solution structure of oryzacystatin-I is the most similar to the crystal structure of chicken egg white cystatin (PDB code, 1CEW) (11) and the crystal structure of monellin (1MOL) (46), then to the crystal structure of human stefin B (1STF) complexed with CMpapain (10), the solution structure of human stefin A (1DVC) (12), the solution structure of chicken egg white cystatin (1A67) (14) and the solution structure of human stefin A (1CYV) (13). Figure 6 is the amino acid sequence alignment based on the conformational similarity obtained from the DALI server (45). The differences in lengths of polypeptide chains are exclusively located in the terminal and loop regions, and thus these molecules can adopt the common architecture. Detailed structural comparison shows that oryzacystatin-I is more similar to chicken egg white cystatin than to human stefins A and B, particularly in (a) the conformation and length of the second binding -hairpin loop (L2, located between 4 and 5), (b) the position of the N-terminal

-strand ( 1), and (c) the orientation of the central R-helix (Figure 5). The second binding loops (L2's) of oryzacystatin-I and chicken egg white cystatin are shorter than those of human stefins A and B by two residues, and as a result, the L2's of the former are narrower than those of the latter (Figure 5). The N-terminal -strands ( 1's) of oryzacystatin-I and chicken egg white cystatin begin at the position 13, while those of human stefins A and B at the position 16 (Figure 5). The central R-helices of oryzacystatin-I and chicken cystatin are somewhat bent or straight, while the R-helix of human stefins A and B are kinked into halves (Figure 5). Because none of the NOE-derived distance restraints in oryzacystatin-I indicate the presence of kink as seen in human stefins A and B, we have judged that the R-helix in oryzacystatin-I is not kinked, but we could not judge whether the R-helix in oryzacystatin-I is slightly bent or straight in solution.
