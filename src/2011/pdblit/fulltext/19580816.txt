PILZ Protein Structure and Interactions with PILB and the FIMX EAL Domain: Implications for Control of Type IV Pilus Biogenesis
Cristiane R. Guzzo, Roberto K. Salinas, Maxuel O. Andrade and Chuck S. Farah
Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, CEP 05508-000, SP, Brazil Received 6 April 2009; received in revised form 20 July 2009; accepted 21 July 2009 Available online 29 July 2009 The PilZ protein was originally identified as necessary for type IV pilus (T4P) biogenesis. Since then, a large and diverse family of bacterial PilZ homology domains have been identified, some of which have been implicated in signaling pathways that control important processes, including motility, virulence and biofilm formation. Furthermore, many PilZ homology domains, though not PilZ itself, have been shown to bind the important bacterial second messenger bis(35)cyclic diGMP (c-diGMP). The crystal structures of the PilZ orthologs from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri (PilZXAC1133, this work) and from Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (XC1028) present significant structural differences to other PilZ homologs that explain its failure to bind c-diGMP. NMR analysis of PilZXAC1133 shows that these structural differences are maintained in solution. In spite of their emerging importance in bacterial signaling, the means by which PilZ proteins regulate specific processes is not clear. In this study, we show that PilZXAC1133 binds to PilB, an ATPase required for T4P polymerization, and to the EAL domain of FimXXAC2398, which regulates T4P biogenesis and localization in other bacterial species. These interactions were confirmed in NMR, two-hybrid and far-Western blot assays and are the first interactions observed between any PilZ domain and a target protein. While we were unable to detect phosphodiesterase activity for FimXXAC2398 in vitro, we show that it binds c-diGMP both in the presence and in the absence of PilZXAC1133. Site-directed mutagenesis studies for conserved and exposed residues suggest that PilZXAC1133 interactions with FimXXAC2398 and PilBXAC3239 are mediated through a hydrophobic surface and an unstructured C-terminal extension conserved only in PilZ orthologs. The FimXPilZ-PilB interactions involve a full set of "degenerate" GGDEF, EAL and PilZ domains and provide the first evidence of the means by which PilZ orthologs and FimX interact directly with the TP4 machinery.

Some are structural pilus components, while others regulate pilus biogenesis, gene expression, or chemosensory pathways that control activity in response to environmental signals.1,6,7 Many proteins have been implicated in the control of T4P functions in response to environmental stimuli including two-component systems,8 alternative sigma factors,9 carbon metabo-

lism regulators,10 chemosensory systems,1 and proteins involved in c-diGMP signaling.7,11 The filament of the TP4 pilus is composed of a helical polymer of mostly PilA pilin subunits.1 Cycles of polymerization, attachment and depolymerization mediate several pilus-dependent phenomena, including twitching motility and natural transformation.12,13 Prepilin monomers are processed in the inner mem-

brane by the prepilin peptidase PilD14 before being incorporated into the base of the growing polymer in a process that requires the inner membrane integral protein PilC and the ATPase activity of PilB.15 The growing pilus passes through the outer membrane through pores formed by PilQ.16 Pilus retraction involves depolymerization at the pilus base and requires the ATPase activity of PilT.17

850 PilZ from P. aeruginosa (PA2960) was identified in 1996 as necessary for T4P biogenesis and twitching motility.18 The pilZ knockout is defective in the secretion of PilA polymers to the bacterial surface, though intracellular PilA pools are not affected.18 On the other hand, a knockout of the PilZ ortholog in Neisseria meningitides is piliated but is not able to produce bacterial aggregates,19 and a PilZ knockout in Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris has slightly reduced T4P-dependent motility on semi-solid Eiken agar.20 These observations suggest that the role of PilZ in T4P biogenesis and function could be modulated by unidentified environmental factors in different ways in different species. To date, no PilZ-interacting protein has been identified and so the precise mechanism by which it controls T4P function is not known. However, over the past decade bacterial genome sequencing projects have identified a highly diverse superfamily of over 1500 PilZ homology domains, most of which have very little sequence similarity with the original PilZ protein. The low level of sequence identity among PilZ homology domains led to their division into several PilZ orthologous groups.21,22 Strong interest in these PilZ homology domains has arisen due to the observation that some can bind cdiGMP.11,22,23,24,25 Interestingly, a recent analysis of the eight PilZ paralogs in P. aeruginosa showed that the original PilZ protein (PA2960) was conspicuous in its inability to bind c-diGMP in vitro.24 Also, only two of five Vibrio cholerae proteins containing PilZ homology domains, PlzB and PlzD, bind cdiGMP in vitro.11 Knockouts in plzB, plzC and plzD resulted in variable changes in motility, biofilm formation and intestinal colonization. 11 PilZ domains can be found alone, in tandem or with other domains most often associated with signal transduction such as REC, PAS, EAL, GGDEF, and HD-GYP domains,21 the last three of which are also involved in c-diGMP signaling. Sequence conservation in the superfamily of PilZ homology domains (120 amino acids) is generally restricted to 10 residues (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Data Fig. 1A),21 the first five of which are found in two N-terminal motifs RxxxR and D/NxSxxG that are involved directly in interactions with cdiGMP.22 Here, we have determined the crystal structure of XAC1133 from the phytopathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri (PilZXAC1133), the cause of citrus canker disease. PilZXAC1133, a singledomain protein, belongs to the orthologous group defined by the original PilZ protein PA2960 that lacks the above signature motifs necessary for cdiGMP binding. Its structure, and that of the ortholog XC1028 from X. campestris pv campestris26 reported during the preparation of this manuscript (PDB ID 3DSG), presents significant differences from those of three other distantly related PilZ homologs determined to date from P. aeruginosa,27 Pseudomonas putida (unpublished results) and from V. cholerae22 that explain why PilZ homologs most closely related to PA2960 do not interact with cdiGMP.24 We show also that PilZXAC1133 interacts

with the PilB ATPase and the EAL domain of XAC2398, a homolog of the T4P regulatory protein FimX from P. aeruginosa.7,28 Both of these interactions are mediated via a conserved patch of hydrophobic and aromatic residues on the PilZ surface, while the interaction with PilB also involves conserved residues within a disordered C-terminal tail. These are the first protein­protein interactions demonstrated for any PilZ homology domain and are the first evidence for a direct physical connection between PilZ, FimX and the TP4 machinery.

Results
PilZXAC1133 structure The crystal structure of selenomethionine-labeled PilZXAC1133 was determined to 1.9 Å resolution. Initial phases were estimated using a multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) dataset, whose crystal parameters and data-reduction statistics have been reported.29 MAD phasing was carried out as described in Materials and Methods and the refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The PilZXAC1133 structure (Fig. 1a) is composed of a central five-stranded -sheet (1, 3­6) that curves upon itself but does not form a closed barrel, leaving a gap between 1 and 3. Associated with

851 The first eight and the last 10 amino acid residues in chain A, and the first seven and the last 11 in chain B are absent. Also lacking density in both monomers is the sequence GAQGNR (residues 74­79), which corresponds to a loop between 4 and 5. In order to investigate the correlation between the absence of electron density and the degree of flexibility of the protein backbone in solution, we measured backbone 15N NMR relaxation rates and heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) of PilZXAC1133. Low or negative {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE values at 27 °C were observed for amide protons in regions for which no electron density was observed (residues 1­7, 74­78, and 107­117) as well as for G90, indicating motions of backbone HN bond vectors on fast timescales (Fig. 2b). The largest interface between monomer units in the crystal (corresponding to the asymmetric unit) buries only 397 Å2 of surface per monomer and so seems to be a result of crystal packing. Consistent with this observation, PilZXAC1133 (13 kDa) elutes as a monomer in gel-filtration chromatography (data

this open barrel is a small two residue -strand (2) that binds in an antiparallel fashion with the N-terminus of 3. Furthermore, two -helices are found at one end of the PilZXAC1133 barrel structure: 1 is located between 1 and 2 and 2 at the C-terminus. As discussed below, the PilZXAC1133 structure presents some surprising differences when compared to the structures of other PilZ homology domains. These differences have important implications regarding PilZ function. Therefore, in order to obtain evidence that these differences are maintained in solution, we produced 15N13C-labeled PilZXAC1133 and assigned its backbone resonances using multidimensional NMR. Analysis of chemical shifts with TALOS 30 show that the secondary structure elements present in solution correspond very well to those observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 2a). There are two polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit. Their structures are very similar, with an RMSD of 0.82 Å for all atoms and 0.06 Å for main chain atoms.

This value is compatible with an 18 kDa protein, which suggests some aggregation in the NMR sample where the protein was present at 0.3 mM. Structural comparison between PilZXAC1133 with other PilZ domains The structures of three PilZ domains are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB): the NMR structure of P. aeruginosa protein PA4608 (PDBID 1YWU),27 the crystal structure of P. putida PP4397 (2GJG; Joint Center for Structural Genomics, unpublished results) and the crystal structures of V. cholerae protein VCA0042 determined in the apo conformation (1YLN; M. Zhou et al. unpublished results) and in complex with c-diGMP (2RDE).22 Although PA4608, PP4397 and VCA0042 share b20% sequence identity (Fig. 1E), they have similar structural topologies consisting of a closed -barrel composed of six antiparallel sheets followed by an -helix (Supplementary Data Fig. 2). Comparison of the PilZXAC1133 structure with that of PA4608, PP4397 and VCA0042 PilZ domains revealed significant structural differences in protein topology involving the first two secondary structure elements; namely, 1-1 in PilZXAC1133 and 1-2 in PA4608, PP4397 and VCA0042. Furthermore, 1 in PilZXAC1133 hydrogen bonds with 4 in a parallel manner, while 1 in PA4608, PP4397 and VCA0042 associates with both 4 and 2 in an anti-parallel manner (Fig. 1a­d; Supplementary Data Fig. 2). PA4608 and VCA0042 bind c-diGMP. 11,27,22 Ligand binding is mediated by the RxxxR motif, located in an unstructured region preceding 1, and the D/NxSxxG motif, located in a loop between 2 and 3 (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Data Fig 1A).21,22 Mutations in these residues have been shown to abolish binding to c-diGMP,11,23,24,25 and the region containing these motifs corresponds precisely to that in which the PilZXAC1133 structure differs from VCA0042 most significantly (Fig. 1a­ d). These differences show clearly that the cdiGMP binding site localized in the N-termini and in the loop between 2 and 3 from VCA0042 does not exist in the PilZXAC1133 structure (Fig. 1; Supplementary Data Fig. 2). As a consequence, PilZXAC1133 should not interact with c-diGMP. To test this hypothesis, the 1 H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of 15N labeled PilZXAC1133 were obtained in the absence and in the presence of c-diGMP at a 1:1 molar ratio and no chemical shift perturbation was observed (Supplementary Data Fig. 3A). Moreover, the addition of c-diGMP does not increase the thermal stability of PilZXAC1133 as measured in circular dichroism experiments (Supplementary Data Fig. 3B).

PILZ Structure and Interactions

PilZXAC1133 is a member of a PilZ ortholog group with distinct sequence signatures that map to one face of the 3D structure There are more than 1500 sequences for eubacterial PilZ homology domains annotated in the Pfam database. 31 These domains are highly diverse, with only a handful of well-conserved residues as described above (Supplementary Data Fig. 1A). Benach et al. showed that this superfamily can be divided into 28 families that also cluster together on a basis that reflects their context within the architectures of multi-domain proteins.22 Figure 3a shows that the group of homologs most similar to PA2690 and PilZXAC1133 (which we refer to as the PilZ PA2960/XAC1133 orthologous group) does not possess the RxxxR or D/NxSxxG motifs involved in c-diGMP binding though it does possess one conserved basic residue preceding the first beta  strand (not modeled in the PilZXAC1133 structure due to lack of electron density) and G33 corresponds structurally to the last residue of the D/NxSXXG motif at the N-terminus of 3 (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Data Fig. 1b). The sequence conservation profile of the PilZ PA2960/XAC1133 orthologous group, as defined by the approximately 100 PA2960/XAC1133 orthologs in the public databases (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Data Fig. 1B), presents five highly conserved sequence motifs (MI ­ MV) that correspond to the following residues in PilZXAC1133: L21Y22xxY25M26P27F28xxxG32G33(I/L)34F35(V/I)36xT38 (MI), G65xV67xW69xxP72 (MII), G82(I/V)83G84(I/V)85 (MIII), (R/K)97xxI100E101xxL104 (MIV) and S110xxxT114xT116 (MV). The first four motifs all cluster to one face of the PilZXAC1133 structure (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data Fig. 1D) and display several highly conserved aromatic or hydrophobic residues exposed at the protein surface: Y22,Y25, P27, F28, F35, W69, P72 and L104 (Fig. 3c). The last motif (MV) is located in an unstructured C-terminal region following 2, consistent with the 15 N NMR heteronuclear NOE data presented above (Fig. 2b). Perturbations in stability and structure caused by PilZXAC1133 mutants In order to probe the relationships between conserved residues and PilZXAC1133 function, we produced a set of PilZXAC1133 mutants in which some of the conserved aromatic or hydrophobic residues were mutated to alanine (PilZY22A, PilZY25A, PilZF28A, PilZW69A, PilZL104A). Two highly conserved charged residues in the C-terminal helix, 2, were also mutated (PilZR97A, PilZE101A). Finally, a deletion of the last 10 amino acids (PilZ107-117) removed all of the C-terminal residues that were not modeled due to lack of electron density in the PilZXAC1133 (including conserved motif MV, S110xxxT114xT116). The conformational stability of these mutants was evaluated by following circular dichroism during thermal denaturation of the purified recombinant

proteins. The Y22A, F28A, W69A, E101A, and 107117 mutations resulted in little or no reduction in thermal stability (Supplementary Data Fig. 4a), while the Y25A, R97A, and L104A mutations decreased the structural stability of PilZXAC1133 significantly (Supplementary Data Fig. 4b). We analyzed the 15N-1H HSQC spectra of these mutants in order to assess how each mutation affected the PilZXAC1133 structure (Supplementary Data Fig. 5). Extreme line-broadening was observed in the spectra of the PilZY25A (data not shown) and PilZL104A (Supplementary Data Fig. 5). This is consistent with the reduced stability of mutants Y25A and L104A, and may be due to disruption of a network of hydrophobic interactions involving these two residues that could be important for stabilizing the structure (Supplementary Data Fig. 6A). The HSQC spectra of the remaining mutants showed sharp lines indicative

of well-folded proteins. In all cases, chemical shift perturbations could be observed for specific resonances. (The residues whose 15N-1H resonances presented the most significant perturbations in PilZY22A, PilZF28A, PilZW69A, PilZR97A, PilZ107-117 are mapped to the PilZ structure in Supplementary Data Figure 6B­F and discussed in the figure legend.) PilZXAC1133 protein­protein interactions with XAC2398, a FimX homolog, suggest a role in c-diGMP signaling We used PilZXAC1133 as a bait in two-hybrid assays against a Xac total genomic DNA prey library.32 One of the interactions detected was with the uncharacterized protein XAC2398. This hypothetical protein has 689 residues and is composed of four domains: a response regulator receiver domain

854 (REC, residues 11­120), a PAS domain (residues 144­254), a GGDEF domain (residues 268­425), and an EAL domain (residues 441­685). XAC2398 is a homolog of the P. aeruginosa FimX protein, which is involved in the control of T4P biogenesis and twitching motility (see below). 7 We refer to XAC2398 as FimXXAC2398. The smallest fragment of FimXXAC2398 that interacted with PilZXAC1133 corresponds to residues 419­689, which begins at the extreme C-terminus of the GGDEF domain and includes the whole EAL domain. Furthermore, when we used an FimXXAC2398 fragment containing only the GGDEF and EAL domains (FimXGGDEF-EAL, residues 270­689) as a bait in two-hybrid assays against the Xac prey library, one of the preys identified corresponded to almost full-length PilZXAC1133 (beginning at residue 3). To confirm the interaction between PilZXAC1133 and the EAL domain of FimXXAC2398, specific two-hybrid assays were performed using the following FimXXAC2398 fragments as baits against a PilZXAC1133 prey: FimXGGDEF (residues 270­432), FimXEAL (residues 436­689) and FimXGGDEF-EAL. All transformed yeast colonies containing both PilZXAC1133 preys and FimXGGDEF-EAL or XAC2398EAL baits grew in selective medium for the interaction (SC-WLHA), while none of the yeast colonies containing the PilZXAC1133 prey and XAC2398GGDEF bait grew in selective medium (Table 2; Supplementary Data Fig. 7A­C). This result was confirmed in two-hybrid assays using the -galactosidase activity as a reporter for these interactions (Fig. 4). We used NMR spectroscopy to analyze the PilZXAC1133-FimXXAC2398 interaction in vitro. The 1 H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled PilZXAC1133 (Fig. 5a) was compared to that obtained in the presence of full-length unlabeled FimXXAC2398, FimXGGDEF-EAL, FimXGGDEF, and FimXEAL (Fig. 5b­e). Significant perturbations in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, including severe peak-broadening, were observed in all cases except for FimXGGDEF. Only very small perturbations

PILZ Structure and Interactions

were observed in the HSQC spectrum of PilZXAC1133 upon addition of FimXGGDEF, even at the elevated concentrations used in these experiments (0.225 mM). Therefore, both two-hybrid and NMR results suggest that PilZXAC1133 binds to FimXXAC2398 principally via interactions with its EAL domain. FimXGGDEF-EAL and the FimXGGDEF-EAL-PilZ complex bind c-diGMP Some GGDEF and EAL domains can bind cdiGMP.33,34,35,36 However, several GGDEF and EAL domains appear to be enzymatically inactive due to variations in otherwise highly conserved residues required for catalysis.28,35,36,37,38 We measured the thermal stability of FimXGGDEF-EAL in the absence and in the presence of the dinucleotide in order to determine whether FimXXAC2398 could bind cdiGMP. We found that c-diGMP increases the stability of FimXGGDEF-EAL by 4 °C (Fig. 6a), while GTP and ATP did not increase the stability of FimXGGDEF-EAL (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, no c-diGMPinduced increases in stability were observed for isolated EAL or GGDEF domains, nor for a 1:1 mixture of both FimXGGDEF and FimXEAL (data not shown). Therefore, it is not clear from our data to which domain c-diGMP binds, and the possibility exists that it may require both domains for binding. Ligand binding was observed in NMR experiments in which specifically the H8 and H1 c-diGMP resonances were attenuated significantly upon the addition of full-length FimXXAC2398 (Supplementary Data Fig. 8). Finally, we observed that c-diGMP induces a 3°C increase in stability of the FimXGGDEF-EAL­PilZXAC1133 complex, indicating that PilZXAC1133 does not inhibit c-diGMP binding to XAC2398GGDEF-EAL under the assay conditions used (Fig. 6b). The above results show that while PilZ does not bind c-diGMP on its own, it does interact with FimXXAC2398 protein domains that bind the cyclic dinucleotide.

These clones were tested individually for growth in SC plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine and adenine (SC-WHLA). PilZXAC1133 interacts with FimXGGDEF_EAL, FimXEAL and PilBXAC3239 but not with FimXGGDEF. The mutant PilZ107-117 maintains interactions with FimXGGDEF-EAL and FimXEAL but does not interact with PilBXAC3239.

A ternary PilBXAC3239­PilZXAC1133­FimXXAC2398 complex The PilBXAC3239­PilZXAC1133 interaction detected in the far-Western assay was stable in the presence of FimXGGDEF-EAL in the presence and in the absence of c-diGMP (Fig. 7b). In order to determine whether PilZXAC1133, PilBXAC3239 and FimXGGDEF-EAL, could form a stable ternary complex, we performed farWestern assays in which PilBXAC3239 immobilized on the membrane was incubated with PilZXAC1133 and FimXGGDEF-EAL. Using an antibody against the polyhistidine tag in recombinant FimXGGDEF-EAL, we observed that FimXGGDEF-EAL colocalizes with PilBXAC3239 only in the presence of PilZXAC1133 (Fig. 7c). This observation implies that PilZXAC1133 can bind to PilBXAC3239 and FimXXAC2398simultaneously. This ternary complex is observed in the presence and in the absence of up to 2 M c-diGMP (Fig. 7c). PilZ residue Y22, but not residues 107­117, is involved in interactions with FimXXAC2398 Since the most highly conserved residues in the PilZ PA2690/XAC1133 orthologous group map to either one face of the PilZ structure (motifs MIMIV) or to an unstructured C-terminus that includes motif MV, we used the PilZY22A and PilZ107-117 mutants as prey in two-hybrid assays against the FimX GGDEF-EAL , FimX GGDEF and FimXEAL baits. The results presented in Table 2 and Fig. 4 (and Supplementary Data Fig. 7A­C) show that the Y22A mutation abolishes interactions with FimX GGDEF-EAL and FimXEAL , while the 107-117 deletion did not effect this interaction. FimXGGDEF did not interact with either of these mutants in these assays. We used the purified 15N labeled PilZXAC1133 mutants and FimXAC2398 to assay for interactions under NMR conditions. (Supplementary Data Fig. 5 compares the 1H-15N HSQC spectra for the 15N-labeled PilZY22A, PilZF28A, PilZ W69A , PilZ R97A , PilZ E101A , PilZ L104A and PilZ107-117 in the absence and in the presence of unlabelled full-length FimXXAC2398). In all cases, including PilZY22A, extensive peak broadening was observed that resulted in the disappearance of the majority of the PilZXAC1133 peaks. Therefore, the Y22A mutation probably reduces the affinity for FimXXAC2398 to levels that cannot be detected in the two-hybrid assays but are still observed at the high concentrations of protein in the NMR sample (0.1 ­ 0.2 mM). Furthermore, in all of these experiments, almost all the main-chain 1H-15N peaks observable in the 1H-15N-HSQC spectra of

Colonies of PJ694-a yeast cells transformed with PilZXAC1133, PilZY22A, or PilZ107-117 preys and/or the FimXGDEF-EAL, FimXGGDEF, FimXEAL or PilBXAC3239 baits were selected on SC-L, SC-WL or SC-WLHA plates. Individual colonies were used to inoculate liquid cultures and -galactosidase activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods. Colonies containing the PilZXAC1133 or PilZ107-117 preys and FimXGGDEF-EAL or FimXEAL baits present significantly greater activity than the no bait control (PilZ alone) or cells containing the PilZXAC1133 prey and FimXGGDEF bait grown in SC-WL media. Cells containing the PilZXAC1133 prey and FimXGGDEF bait did not grow in SCWLHA medium. These results are consistent with the conclusion that PilZXAC1133 interacts with the FimXXAC2398 EAL domain and that PilZXAC1133 residues 107­117 are not required for interaction. Similarly, PilZXAC1133, but not PilZ107-117, interacts with PilBXAC3239. All cells carrying the PilZY22A prey did not grow in SC-WLHA and showed only background levels of -galactosidase when grown in SC-WL medium, consistent with our observations that this mutant does not interact with FimXXAC2398 or PilBXAC3239. The galactosidase activity is within the range normally observed using PJ694-a yeast cells.67

PilZXAC1133 protein­protein interactions with PilB provide the first direct physical link to T4P biogenesis Using PilZXAC1133 as a bait in two-hybrid assays against the Xac prey library, we detected two preys derived from XAC3239, a PilB ortholog (PilBXAC3239). These preys correspond to almost full-length PilB XAC3239 fragments, the smallest of which begins at residue 59 of this 578 residue protein. PilB proteins are hexameric ATPases associated with the base of T4P at the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane where they are involved in the control of T4P polymerization/extension.39,40 To confirm the interaction between PilZXAC1133 and PilBXAC3239, two-hybrid assays were performed using PilBXAC3239 as bait against the PilZXAC1133

The resonances of the disordered C-terminal tail of PilZXAC1133 are still observable in the 15N-HSQC spectrum of the complex with full-length FimXXAC2398 (b), indicating that the C-terminal backbone experiences a different motional regime. The spectra were acquired at 500 MHz 1 H frequency, except for the spectrum in a, which was acquired at 600 MHz. The sample conditions were as described in Materials and Methods.

the 15 N-PilZXAC1133­FimXXAC2398 complexes are derived from the disordered C-terminus (residues 110, 111, 112, 114 and 117 labeled in Fig. 5b; Supplementary Data Fig. 5). This is consistent with the conclusion that the last 10 PilZXAC1133 residues are not involved in interaction with FimXXAC2398.

PilZ residues 107­117 are involved in interactions with PilBXAC3239 When PilZY22A and PilZ107-117 were used as prey in two-hybrid assays, the no interaction with PilBXAC3239 was observed (Table 2, Fig. 4; Supplementary Data

857 pilZXAC1133, fimXXAC2398 and pilBXAC3239 mutants present increased motility on semisolid surfaces Xac pilZXAC1133 and fimXXAC2398 null mutants were able to induce citrus canker symptoms in a manner similar to that observed for wild type Xac (Supplementary Data Fig. 10). The pilZ gene was originally identified in P. aeruginosa as necessary for twitching motility.18 We have not been able to establish reproducible subsurface stab twitching assays for Xac. However, we were able to do motility assays on semi-solid agar surfaces. We found that the pilZXAC1133 knockout has increased motility on semi-solid agar surfaces in several nutrient media tested, including SB, XVM2 and STON (Fig. 8; Supplementary Data Fig. 11). Complementation with a plasmid carrying the wild type pilZXAC1133 gene under control of its own promoter or under the control of a constitutive lac promoter led to full or partial recovery of the wild type phenotype (Fig. 8; Supplementary Data Fig. 11). A similar increase in motility was observed for the fimXXAC2398 knockout strain in all three media, and complementation by the introduction of the fimXXAC2398 gene in trans resulted in recovery of the wild type phenotype (Supplementary Data Fig. 11). Furthermore, the pilBXAC3239 knockout strain had increased motility in SB medium (Fig. 8c). The addition of NaCl (300 mM final concentration) or using base medium containing 100 mM potassium phosphate7 severely decreased motility of the wild type and pilZXAC1133 knockout strains (data not shown). In Eiken agar, the pilZXAC1133 knockout had motility very similar to that observed for the wild type Xac strain, while the fimXXAC2398 knockout had increased motility (data not shown). Complementation of the pilZXAC1133 null strain with a plasmid carrying the pilZ107-117 gene did not recover the wild type phenotype in SB medium (Fig. 8a). As the deletion of residues 107­117 weakens the PilZ­PilB interaction (above), this result is consistent with a role for PilZ in the control of PilB function. Finally, in these assays, a knockout in the fliC gene that codes for the principal flagellar subunit did not show any motility change in SB and STON media, and had increased motility in Eiken agar (data not shown), indicating that the observed motility is not dependent on flagella. Bacterial spreading on semisolid surfaces in the absence of T4P and flagella, called sliding motility, has been observed before in P. aeruginosa (see Discussion).41

The PilBXAC3239 interactions with PilZXAC1133 and its mutants were analyzed by far-Western assays using immobilized PilBXAC3239 and anti-PilZXAC1133 antibodies (Fig. 7a). No interaction was observed between PilBXAC3239 and PilZY22A, or PilZW69A and PilZR97A, while very weak interactions were observed for PilZY28A, PilZL104A and PilZ107-117 (Fig. 7a). The PilBXAC3239 interactions observed for PilZY25A and PilZE101A were significant, but less than that observed for wild type PilZXAC1133 (Fig. 7a).

Discussion
While the central role of c-diGMP signaling in bacteria is now well recognized, few specific cdiGMP targets are known. Other than the active sites of the GGDEF, EAL and HDGYP domains, the only other known binding sites for c-diGMP are cdiGMP riboswitches,40 the allosteric site (I site) of the DGC PleD from C. crescentus,34 PelD,42 and

Total cell lysates of E. coli cells expressing PilBXAC3239 (+) or an unrelated protein YaeQ (­) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with PilZXAC1133 or its mutants. Bound PilZ was detected with PilZXAC1133 antiserum and protein A peroxidase. Y22A, F28A W69A, R97A, L104A and 107-117 mutations resulted in severe reductions in binding. (b) PilZXAC1133 can bind to PilBXAC3239 in the presence of FimXXAC2398. Far-Western assays were performed as described for a, except that FimXGGDEF-EAL and c-diGMP were added to the incubations where indicated. The amount of protein or cdiGMP present in the incubations was 1 M (+), 2 M (++) or 4 M (++++). (c) Far-Western assays were used as described for b, except that bound FimXXAC2398 was detected using anti-serum against its polyhistidine tag.

FleQ 43 from P. aeruginosa and PilZ-homology domains from a number of bacteria. 11,22,23,24,25 However, the only PilZ domain to which c-diGMP binding has been shown to regulate specific protein function is that found in subunit A of cellulose synthase.44 All other pilZ phenotypes have involved stand-alone PilZ domains or PilZ domains contained within proteins of unknown molecular function.21 Some PilZ homology domains have been shown to bind c-diGMP, while others have failed to do so in in vitro binding assays.11,24,26 The structure of PilZXAC1133 reveals an unexpected structural diversity in the topology of the PilZ fold,

which abolishes the c-diGMP binding site in the PilZ PA2960/XAC1133 orthologous group. Highly conserved residues within this group map to one surface of the domain structure and include a significant number of exposed hydrophobic side chains that potentially mediate interactions with other proteins, including FimXXAC2398 and PilBXAC3239 identified in this work. This hypothesis is supported by the reduced interactions observed using PilZXAC1133 mutants (specifically PilZY22A for FimXXAC2398 and PilZY22A, PilZY28A, PilZW69A and PilZL104A for PilBXAC3239). Furthermore, two-hybrid and farWestern analysis indicate that the well-conserved

though conformationally flexible C-terminus of PilZXAC1133 contributes to its interactions with PilB XAC3239 . The observation that the Y22A mutation reduces PilZXAC1133 binding to both FimXXAC2398 and PilBXAC3239 suggests that this residue might have a regulatory role in these interactions: via a direct interaction with one of the two partner proteins, Y22 could trigger a conformational change in PilZ that would then allow it to bind the other partner in the ternary complex. One observation consistent with this idea is that the Y22A mutation results in significant chemical perturbations in several residues, some of which are located in the unstructured C-terminal region (residues 107, 114, and 116) identified to be important for interactions with PilB. Furthermore, deletion of residues 107­117 perturbs the chemical shift of Y22 as well as other residues in the 1-1 loop and within the Nterminal half of 1 (Supplementary Data Figs. 5, 6B and 6F). The PilZXAC1133­FimXXAC2398 interaction is mediated by the FimXXAC2398 EAL domain. FimXXAC2398 is a homolog of the P. aeruginosa FimX protein.7,28 These two proteins share 30% sequence identity

over their entire length.7 There are at the moment 42 FimX homologs with the same domain topology in the public databases and all lack an aspartate critical for phosphorylation of their REC domains by cognate histidine kinases (data not shown).7 Interestingly, all these homologs are found in organisms whose genomes code for a member of the PilZ PA2690/XAC1133 orthologous group (data not shown). The sequence requirement for substrate binding and catalysis by EAL and GGDEF domains has been investigated intensively over the past few years. Rao et al. have proposed a catalytic mechanism for EAL domains in which they identify seven residues essential for PDE activity: a general base catalyst, four residues that coordinate an essential magnesium ion and two residues that have a structural role.38 While the P. aeruginosa FimX protein has both nonconservative substitutions in several of these residues, there are conflicting reports regarding its PDE activity. 28,38 In FimXXAC2398, the residue involved in general base catalysis is conserved (E653), but all four Mg2+ -coordinating residues are modified (Q477, R534, Q566, and E596, which are

PILZ Structure and Interactions

Fig. 9. PilB­PilZ­FimX interactions in the context of T4P. The filament of TP4 is a polymer of pilin subunits (mostly PilA). After being processed by the prepilin peptidase, pilin subunits associated with the inner membrane are incorporated into the base of the pilus filament in a process that requires the inner membrane protein PilC and the ATPase activity of PilB, which forms a hexameric ring associated with the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane.4,57 The growing pilin polymer passes through pores formed by PilQ in the outer membrane.16 Pili are depolymerized in a process that requires the hexameric PilT ATPase. 17 PilZ interacts with PilB and with XAC2398, a FimX homolog (FimXXAC2398). FimX itself may be tethered to the inner membrane via interactions between its REC domain with an unknown protein (?).7,28 These interactions point to a means by which specific signals that impinge on FimX X A C2 3 9 8 could directly, or indirectly via PilZ, regulate PilB function or contribute to the control of which ATPase ­ PilB or PilT ­ is positioned to control T4P polymerization or retraction.

normally E, N, E, and D residues, respectively, in active EAL domains).38 This extensive modification of the EAL motif in FimXXAC2398 could explain our failure to detect PDE activity in purified recombinant FimXXAC2398 or its fragments under all conditions tested, including in the presence of GTP and/ or PilZXAC1133 (data not shown). In the case of GGDEF domains, two classes of c-diGMP binding sites have been identified: the catalytic (A) site and the inhibitory (I) site. These sites are defined by characteristic GG(D/E)EF and RXXD motifs, respectively, which are separated by a five residue linker.45 These two motifs are severely substituted in both FimXXAC2398 (GEHSF and DXXV) and FimX from P. aeruginosa (GDSIF and GXXA), and so it is unlikely that c-diGMP binds to the GGDEF domains of these proteins. GTP binding by noncatalytic GGDEF domains has been reported,37 and has been proposed for the GGDEF domain of P. aeruginosa FimX.28 The above considerations are consistent with our inability to detect diguanylate cyclase or PDE activities for FimXXAC2398 and suggest that cdiGMP binding probably occurs via the EAL domain, even though we detected binding only when using the FimXGGDEF-EAL fragment. The noncatalytic binding of c-diGMP by EAL domains has been shown to have physiological relevance in some cases. For example, the degenerate and inactive EAL domain of LapD from Pseudomonas fluorescens acts as a sensor of cytoplasmic c-diGMP levels in the control of localization of the LapA adhesin on the bacterial surface.36

While no interaction between PilZ and EAL domains has been reported, recent studies have shown that alginate biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa is controlled by two membrane-associated proteins; Alg44, which binds c-diGMP via a PilZ domain,24,46 and by MucR, which contains C-terminal GGDEF and EAL domains.47 It has been proposed that MucR regulates alginate biosynthesis through generation of a localized c-diGMP pool in the vicinity of Alg44. 47 Another nonexclusive possibility, suggested by our results, is that Alg44 and MucR could bind to one another directly via interactions involving their respective PilZ and EAL domains. Furthermore, this interaction could be modulated by the binding of c-diGMP to either or both proteins. This raises the possibility that PilZ-EAL domain interactions are not restricted to the FimX-PilZ-T4P system described here but, rather, could be a more general phenomenon. This is suggested also by the observation that PilZ and EAL domains are located close to each other at the C-termini of some proteins.21 The direct physical interactions of PilZXAC1133 with FimXXAC2398 and PilBXAC3239 and the phenotypes of the pilZXAC1133, fimXXAC2398 and pilBXAC3239 knockout strains in surface motility assays is consistent with the little we know regarding the functions of their most closely related homologs in P. aeruginosa. The transport of PilA monomers to the bacterial surface is greatly reduced in P. aeruginosa pilZ, fimX and pilB mutants, while the cellular pools of PilA subunits are not modified significantly.18,7,48,49 Although we have

PILZ Structure and Interactions

861 environmental signals can be transmitted to PilZXAC1133 and, directly or indirectly, to PilB and the rest of the T4P apparatus. In P. aeruginosa, FimX localizes to the cell pole in a manner that depends on both EAL domain PDE activity and the N-terminal REC domain,28 and the REC domain on its own has been shown to localize to the cell pole, presumably via interactions with unidentified proteins.7 The FimXXAC2398­PilZXAC1133­PilBXAC3239 interaction observed in this study implies that FimXXAC2398 may be tethered to the membrane via both its Nterminal REC domain and its C-terminal EAL domain. Figure 9 presents a model of the T4P that has incorporated key features regarding what we know about PilBXAC3239, FimXXAC2398 and PilZ PA2960/XAC1133 orthologous group function as well as possible mechanisms by which pilus biogenesis and function may be controlled via the interactions identified in this study. These possible mechanisms include: (i) regulation of the kinetics of the PilB ATPase cycle via direct interactions with PilZ or by PilB­FimX interactions that are too weak to be observed in the absence of PilZ; (ii) modulation of PilZ-PilB or FimX-PilB interactions by c-diGMP binding to FimX and/or the binding of other signaling molecules to other FimX domains; and (iii) the possibility that FimX­PilZ­PilB interactions may contribute to the control of which hexameric ATPase, PilB or PilT, is positioned to control T4P polymerization or retraction. It has been proposed that c-diGMP signaling pathways operating in parallel avoid cross-talk (or cdiGMP "noise") by sequestering the signaling modules of a pathway into specific microenvironments.45,59,60 This "functional sequestration" is realized via the formation of multidomain complexes that are held together within the same polypeptide chain or via noncovalent interactions.59 Hengge has proposed that this local confinement has led to the evolution of signaling systems in which c-diGMP metabolism has been discarded.59 The FimX­PilZ­PilB interactions described here are the first system that involves a full set of "degenerate" GGDEF, EAL and PilZ domains in which signaling to the final target, in this case the PilB ATPase, is mediated principally via protein­protein interactions. Whether these interactions are modulated by c-diGMP binding to FimX is still unclear.

been unable to establish a reproducible twitching motility assay for Xac, we can observe its spreading across semisolid medium. This spreading is not swarming since it is not reduced in the fliCXAC1975 mutant strain. (Note that while bacterial swarming on wet surfaces requires flagella,50 flagellum-independent migration on semi-solid surfaces has been observed in Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli51). Some reports have provided evidence that T4P are required for swarming motility in P. aeruginosa,52,53 while others have reported swarming in their absence.41,54,55 Under certain nutrient conditions, P. aeruginosa motility on swarm plates is increased in a pilA mutant that lacks T4P.55 Furthermore, Murray and Kazmierczak have shown recently that P. aeruginosa exhibits sliding motility on a semisolid agar surface in the absence of both flagella and T4P.41 Sliding is a passive bacterial transport mechanism that is highly correlated with the secretion of surfacewetting substances, such as rhamnolipids, lipopeptides, lipopolysaccharides and glycolipids, that reduce surface tension and friction between cell and surface; in this way, the expansive forces within a growing culture can be harnessed as a means of transport.50,56 This motility is inhibited by surface structures such as T4P or flagella, possibly by increasing interaction between the bacterial cell and the substrate.41 The pilZXAC1133, fimXXAC2398, pilBXAC3239, and fliCXAC1975 phenotypes are therefore consistent with increased Xac sliding motility on semisolid agar in mutants lacking T4P or flagella. Here, we provide the first demonstration of a physical interaction between PilZ and a T4P component (PilB), and provide evidence that the interaction involves a conserved motif at the disordered PilZ C-terminus. PilB is an ATPase that forms a hexameric ring structure associated with the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane and has a central role in T4P biogenesis. The mechanism by which pilus assembly occurs at the inner membrane is unknown but a model based on the genetic and biochemical evidence as well as the available structural data on T4P components suggests that PilB and the inner membrane protein PilC work together to transfer pilin subunits from an inner membrane pool to the base of the growing pilus polymer, and insertion of each pilin monomer is associated with the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule: ATP hydrolysis induces a conformational change in PilB that is transmitted via PilC to drive the growing filament outward towards the periplasm.4,57 The homologous PilT ATPase presumably controls pilus retraction/depolymerization via a similar process but whose ATP-induced conformational change results in subunits being extracted from the base of the filament.4,57,58 It is not clear whether the PilZ­PilB interaction controls PilB ATPase activity directly or whether PilZ acts as an adapter molecule to which other regulatory molecules may be assembled to interact transiently with PilB or other T4P subunits. The interaction between PilZXAC1133 and the FimXXAC2398 points to a possible means by which specific

Materials and Methods
Cloning Full-length PilZXAC1133 was cloned in expression plasmid pET3a and purified, as described.29 Site-directed mutagenesis of the pilZXAC1133 gene in the pET-3a vector was used to produce the Y22A, Y25A, F28A, W69A, R97A, E101A, L104 and 107-117 mutants via a singlestep PCR protocol using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (STRATAGENE). Also, the mutant PilZ preys (Y22A and 107-117) in the two-hybrid vector pOAD were produced using the same primers and protocol. (The primers used for each mutation are listed in Supplementary Data Table 1D.) Coding sequences for

862
FimXXAC2398, FimXGGDEF-EAL, FimXEAL, FimXGGDEF, and PilBXAC3239 were amplified by PCR from Xac genomic DNA61 using specific primers and cloned into the expression vectors pET3a and/or pET28a,62 or into the two-hybrid bait vector pOBD.63 (The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Data Table 1A.) FimXXAC2398 and PilBXAC3239 correspond to the full-length proteins, while FimXGGDEF-EAL, FimXGGDEF, and FimXEAL correspond to FimXXAC2398 residues 267­689, 267­432, and 436­689, respectively. All clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Construction of Xac knockout strains In-frame deletions in the pilZXAC1133, xac2398 and fliCxac1975 genes were obtained by a two-step allelic exchange procedure. Briefly, approximately 1 kb corresponding to upstream and downstream regions of the two genes were amplified by PCR (the primers are listed in Supplementary Data Table 1B.) Each pair of fragments was ligated to produce a deleted version of the gene and then cloned into the pNPTS138 suicide vector (Alley Dickon, unpublished results) in the restriction sites given in Supplementary Data Table 1B. These plasmids were introduced into Xac by electroporation, and sucrose-sensitive and kanamycin- and ampicilin-resistant colonies were selected. Liquid cultures of these colonies were grown without selection, plated and individual colonies were selected for simultaneous kanamycin sensitivity and sucrose resistance. Deletions were confirmed by PCR. In order to complement the pilZXAC1133 and xac2398 knockouts, fragments coding for pilZXAC1133 and xac2398 plus approximately 1 kb of upstream sequences were amplified using the primers described in Supplementary Data Table 1C and cloned into pUFR047. 64 The pilZXAC1133 knockout was also complemented with the pMR20 vector65 containing the coding sequences for PilZXAC1133 and PilZ107-117. These sequences were amplified using the oligonucleotides given in Supplementary Data Table 1C and the respective pET3aderived expression vectors as templates. The amplified fragments were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pMR20. The pUFR047_pilZ, pUFR047_fimX, pMR20_pilZ and pMR20_pilZ107-117 constructs were used to transform the Xac pilZXAC1133 and fimXXAC2398 mutants to produce strains pilZXAC1133+pUFR047_pilZ, fimXXAC2398+pUFR047_fimX, pilZXAC1133 +pMR20_pilZ and pilZXAC1133+pMR20_pilZ107-117. In order to produce the pilBXAC3239 knockout strain, a 1000 bp fragment corresponding to an internal segment of the pilBXAC3239 gene was amplified using the oligonucleotides given in Supplementary Data Table 1B then cloned to TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), digested with EcoRI and ligated into pNPTS138. Xac cells were transformed using this construct (pNPTS_pilB) and initially selected for growth in 100 g/ml of kanamycin and sensitivity to 5% (w/v) sucrose. These colonies were grown in the presence of kanamycin without sucrose and kanamycinand sucrose-resistant clones were selected. Clones were confirmed by PCR to have two truncated copies of the pilBXAC3239 gene. Protein expression and purification Conditions for protein expression (host E. coli strain and temperature) are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 1A. Proteins were produced by growing 1l

PILZ Structure and Interactions cultures of transformed E. coli cells in 2xTY culture supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/ml) or kanamycin (100 mg/ml) to an A600 nm of 0.8, at which time isopropyl-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added (final concentration 0.4 mM) and the cells were grown for 4 h before sedimentation and storage at ­80°C. Cells were resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 25% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and lysed using a French press. EDTA was omitted for FimXGGDEF-EAL. To purify FimXXAC2398, the soluble fraction the cell lysate was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow Hiload 16/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia) that was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 6.3), 14 mM mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA. Bound proteins were eluted using a 0­1M NaCl gradient over 12 column volumes. Fractions containing FimXXAC2398 were loaded onto a Superdex 200 Fast Flow Hiload 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia) that was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 14 mM -mercaptoethanol, 250 mM NaCl. To purify FimXGGDEF-EAL, which contains an N-terminal polyhistidine tag, the soluble fraction of the cell lysate was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, 200 mM NaCl and eluted with a 0­1 M imidazole gradient. Fractions containing FimXGGDEF-EAL were then separated by passage through a Superdex 200 column that was equilibrated with 5 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mM NaCl. To purify FimXGGDEF, the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column that was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 14 mM -mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA. Bound proteins were eluted using a 0­1 M NaCl gradient over 12 column volumes. Fractions containing FimXGGDEF were pooled, concentrated and separated by passage through a Superdex 75 Fast Flow column that was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 14 mM -mercaptoethanol, 250 mM NaCl. To purify FimXEAL, the soluble fraction of the bacterial cell lysate was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow Hiload column that was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), 14 mM -mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA. Bound proteins were eluted using a 0­0.5 M NaCl gradient over 12 column volumes. Fractions containing XAC2398EAL were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex 75 Fast Flow column that was equilibrated with 5 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, 10 mM NaCl. After the final chromatographic separations, fractions containing FimXXAC2398, FimXGGDEF-EAL , FimX GGDEF or FimX EAL were dialyzed separately against 5 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0) and concentrated to approximately 5 g/l using Centricon (Millipore) concentrators with 10 kDa cut-off. Two-hybrid assays The construction and analysis of the Xac genomic DNA library in the plasmid vector pOAD63 was as described.32,66 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ694-a (MATa trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4 gal80 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7lacZ)67 was grown in SC medium (0.66% (w/v) nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.008% (w/v) adenine, 0.083% (w/v) amino acids mixture, pH 5.6). When necessary, SC medium was prepared lacking one or more of the components adenine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine. Solid medium also contained 1.6% (w/v) Bacto-agar and 5 mM 3-aminotriazole. -

PILZ Structure and Interactions galactosidase activity was measured by selecting cells from SC-WL or SC-WHLA plates to inoculate SC-WL or SC-WHLA liquid cultures that were grown overnight at 30 °C, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of YPD medium (20 g/l Tryptone, 10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l glucose, pH 5.8) and grown for another 4 h. Cells were collected, resuspended in the same volume of Zbuffer (0.06 M Na2HPO4, 0.04 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M KCl, 0.001 M MgSO4, 0.05 M -mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and the A600nm of the resuspended cells was measured. After that, 100 l of chloroform and 50 l of 0.1% (w/v) SDS were added, vortex mixed and incubated for 5 min at 28 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.2 ml of 4 mg/mL o-nitrophenyl--d-galactoside (ONPG), vortex mixed, incubated at 28 °C and time measured until the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1 M Na2CO3. The solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 13000g and the A420nm and at A550nm were recorded. The Miller units were calculated as: Miller units ¼ 1000 ½ðA420nm -1:75 A550nm Þ=ðTVA600nm Þ where T is reaction time (in minutes), and V is volume (in ml). Structure determination and refinement The production and crystallization of selenomethioninelabeled PilZXAC1133 was as described.29 Briefly, crystallization was carried out in sitting-drop plates by mixing equal volumes (1.5 l) of 7.2 mg/ml protein and well solution (24% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 M MgCl2) and growing at 281 K. A MAD dataset from a single crystal that diffracted to 1.9 Å was collected as described.29 No  cutoff was used during the refinement. Selenium sites were found using SHELXD,68 and their positions were subsequently refined and phases calculated using SHARP.69 Phases were refined by density modification using SOLOMON70 and DM.71 The figure of merit for acentric and centric reflections was 0.64 and 0.27, respectively, for data up to 2.42 Å and 0.34 and 0.18 for the data up to 1.9 Å. The resulting electron density map was used to construct a preliminary polyalanine model with ARP/wARP72 that included 82 of the 117 residues distributed over three peptide segments. Interpretation of the electron density maps and construction of the missing residues was done with COOT.73 Initially, the space group was incorrectly assigned as P6122 and the 2-fold axes were close enough to real symmetry axes to allow MAD phasing and model building, but not close enough for refinement convergence. The data were reprocessed in space group P61 and the second PilZXAC1133 molecule in the asymmetric unit was obtained using Phaser.74 Structural refinement of the PilZXAC1133 model was done using CCP4i,75 REFMAC,76 CNS,77 and COOT.73 TLS78 was used in the final cycles of refinement with each chain in the asymmetric unit divided into 15 independent groups. Water molecules were added with ARP/wARP, REFMAC, and directly by COOT. The first eight residues in chain A, the first seven residues in chain B, the last 12 residues for chain A, the last 13 residues for chain B and an internal loop (residues 73­79) of both chains were not modeled due to the absence of electron density. The final R-factor, Rfree and figure of merit values are 0.190, 0.244 and 0.82, respectively. The refinement data statistics are given in Table 1. Analysis of the final PilZXAC1133 model with PROCHECK6 showed that 95.7% of the residues were in most favored regions and 4.3% were in additionally allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot. The

863
coordinates of the final PilZXAC1133 model have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (see below). NMR spectroscopy NMR samples of 13C,15N-labeled PilZXAC1133, or 15Nlabeled PilZXAC1133 mutants, consisted of 0.5 mM protein (unless stated otherwise) in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), 0.150 M NaCl. The sequential assignment of backbone (HN, 15 N, 13C, 13C) resonances of PilZXAC1133 was done by the analysis of CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HN(CO)CA and HNCA spectra79 acquired at 35 °C and at 27 °C in a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm HCN PFG cold probe. Measurements of heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE were carried out in a Bruker DRX spectrometer, operating at 500 MHz, and equipped with a 5 mm TXI probe at 27 °C, using saturation time of 3 s and an inter-scan delay of 1 s. Saturated and control spectra were acquired in interleaved fashion. 15N HSQC experiments of 15N-labeled PilZXAC1133 and PilZ mutants in the presence of unlabeled FimXXAC2398, FimXEAL, FimXEAL-GGDEF or FimXGGDEF were acquired at 27 °C and at 600 MHz, except for the Y22A mutant that was collected at 500 MHz. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe,80 and analyzed using the CCPN Analysis software.81 Far Western protein­protein interaction assays Purified PilZXAC1133 was used to obtain polyclonal antiserum by immunizing rabbits. Lysates of E. coli cultures expressing recombinant PilBXAC3239 protein (or Xac YaeQ protein as a negative control) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with purified recombinant PilZXAC1133 or PilZXAC1133 mutants (1M) for 12 h at room temperature. Where indicated, XAC2398GGDEF-EAL and/ or c-diGMP was also added at concentrations of 1 ­4 M. Membranes were then washed and incubated with antiPilZXAC1133 or anti-His tag antiserum (to detect XAC2398GGDEF-EAL), followed by protein A-peroxidase conjugate and detection of peroxidase activity. Motility assays Motility was measured on the surface of semisolid medium. The following media were used: SB (5 g/ l sucrose, 5 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l Peptone, and 1 g/ l glutamic acid, pH 7.0, 0.6% Bacto-agar), XVM2 (20 mM NaCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.01 mM FeSO4, 5 mM MgSO4, 0.16 mM KH2PO4, 0.32 mM K2HPO4, 10 mM fructose, 10 mM sucrose, 0.03% (v/v) casein acid hydrolysate (Casaminoacids), pH 6.7, 0.6% Bacto-agar), STON (1 g/l Tryptone, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% Bactoagar), and EIKEN (8 g/l Eiken nutrient broth, 0.6% (w/v) Eiken agar). Molten medium was poured into plates and allowed to solidify and dry for 1 h. Xac cells were grown in 2xTY to mid-log phase at 28 °C, diluted to A600nm of 0.3 and 5 l aliquots were used to inoculate the semi-solid surface of the medium followed by incubation at 28°C for two to four days. Protein stability studies Thermal unfolding was followed by measuring []205nm or []220nm as the temperature was increased (0.2 °C/min). The fraction of unfolded protein was calculated by using

864
the pre-transition and post-transition baselines to calculate the fractional change in signal at each temperature point as described.82 Protein concentrations were as indicated in the figures and buffer conditions were 10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl2. Where indicated, 5 M c-diGMP, GTP or ATP was added.
