Fructans are fructose oligomers and polymers synthesized by a small number of plant and bacterial species and mainly function as reserve carbohydrates. The terminal fructosyl-fructose linkages can be degraded by fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), occurring in bacteria, fungi and fructan plants. Unexpectedly, it was found that FEHs also occur in non-fructan plants such as Beta vulgaris and Arabidopsis thaliana that apparently lack endogenous fructan substrates. FEHs might have defense-related roles acting on bacterial fructancontaining slimes or might act on minute (up to now undetected) amounts of fructans acting as signals in plants. Compared with starch and sucrose, fructans are less familiar reserve carbohydrates, occurring in 15% of flowering species that mainly belong to the Asteraceae, Campanulaceae and Boraginaceae (dicots) and Poaceae and Liliaceae (monocots) [1]. They are synthesized by adding b (2,1)- or b (2,6)-linked fructofuranosyl units to three basic trisaccharides (1-kestose, 6-kestose and neokestose); these trisaccharides are produced by linking a fructose moiety to one of the three primary hydroxyl groups of vacuolar sucrose (Box 1). Further elongation occurs by specific fructosyl transferases (Box 1). Linear (2,1)-type fructans (inulins, dicot species) and (2,6)-type fructans (levans, monocots and bacteria) are the simplest and most-studied fructans [2­4]. The species- and even tissue-specific variability in fructan structure and degree of polymerization (DP) can be attributed mainly to differences in fructosyl transferases [5­7]. Fructans can be considered as an extension of vacuolar sucrose [8]. This was demonstrated by the production of fructans in sugar beet, a sucrose-storing species, after introduction of fructosyl transferases [9,10]. Fructans are prebiotics because they selectively promote beneficial colon bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Moreover, fructans stimulate Ca2C resorption from the colon and possibly play an important role in preventing colon cancer [11]. As such, fructans have quickly gained importance as healthy food ingredients [2,3]. So far mainly inulin, a fructan commercially extracted from tap roots of industrial chicory varieties (Cichorium intybus; another variety of this species is used for `Belgian Endive' production), is used as a food and feed

additive [2,3]. However, a major drawback of the use of chicory is the induction of 1-FEH (fructan 1-exohydrolase, inulinase, degrades fructosyl-fructose linkages) in cold temperatures, lowering the quality and decreasing the quantity of the inulin at the end of the growth period and during storage [3,12]. To improve fructan yield and quality, an extensive study of chicory FEHs was started that included gene cloning [13,14]. Other FEH cDNAs have been cloned from other plant species since then [15,16]. Two types of fructan hydrolases are known: exohydrolases remove terminal fructoses or difructoses while endohydrolases cut at random within the fructan chains [17]. Unlike in bacteria and fungi, where both exo- and endo-type fructan hydrolases occur [17], plants apparently only contain FEHs releasing terminal fructose units [4]. All plant FEHs purified to date are unable to degrade sucrose [3], in contrast to microbial exo-hydrolases that mostly can degrade sucrose as well (termed b-fructosidases). Depending on the linkage type attacked, 1-FEH (inulinase) and 6-FEH (levanase) can be distinguished [17]. Essentially, all plant enzymes involved in fructan synthesis and breakdown transfer fructose from a donor to an acceptor substrate (Box 1), but each enzyme has a preferred or unique substrate for donor (fructan, sucrose) and acceptor (fructan, sucrose or water). All are glycoproteins highly homologous to invertases [2] and belong to the GH32 family of enzymes [18,19]. Most bacterial fructans are of the levan-type and are biosynthesized by levansucrase [20,21]. A minority of bacterial species are able to synthesize inulins by inulosucrase [22]. However, levansucrases and inulosucrases belong to another enzyme family (GH68). Here we review the recent progress in the rapidly developing field of FEH research. The recent discovery of FEHs in non-fructan plants raises questions about the function to be fulfilled by these enzymes in the absence of endogenous fructan substrates. Roles of intracellular FEHs in fructan plants (Type A) Fructans can comprise up to 80% of the dry weight of fructan plants [4]. By degrading endogenous fructans, FEHs from fructan plants (which we propose to term Type A FEHs) fulfill a diverse set of functions: (i) they hydrolyze fructan reserves whenever energy supplies are needed [14,23]; (ii) they quickly increase the osmotic pressure (e.g. Campanula flower opening) [24,25]; (iii) they increase oligofructan concentrations under stress [12],

Box 1. Model of the enzymology of fructan biosynthesis and breakdown in plants
Three basic fructan trisaccharides [(a) 1-kestose; (b) 6-kestose and (c) neokestose] are produced by linking a fructose moiety to one of the three primary hydroxyl groups of sucrose (Figure I). The enzyme sucrose: sucrose 1-fructosyl transferase (1-SST, depicted in blue) produces 1-kestose and glucose from two sucrose molecules. Further elongation with b(2,1) fructosyl units is catalyzed by the enzyme fructan: fructan 1-fructosyl transferase (1-FFT, depicted in black) that uses 1-kestose as the preferential donor to produce linear inulin-type fructans (e.g. in dicot species). In cereals, 6-kestose probably results from a side reaction of sucrose: fructan 6-fructosyl transferase (6-SFT), an enzyme preferring 1-kestose as an acceptor to produce the branched fructan bifurcose. It is still a matter of debate whether specific sucrose: sucrose 6-fructosyl transferase (6-SST) enzymes occur in grasses. 6-Kestose can be further elongated to linear levan by 6-SFT (depicted in dark green). Branched graminans can be obtained

by the combined action of 6-SFT and 1-FFT. Neokestose trisacccharide is biosynthesized in two steps: first, 1-SST produces 1-kestose; second, 1-kestose is used as a donor substrate by the enzyme fructan: fructan 6G-fructosyl transferase (6G-FFT). With sucrose as acceptor, neokestose is produced. The action of a putative 6-SFT (neokestose levan series) or 1-FFT (neokestose inulin series) can produce further elongation. In onion, 6G-FFT shows intrinsic 1-FFT activity. Breakdown of all fructan types is performed by the (combined) action of fructan 1-exohydrolase or inulinase (1-FEH, depicted in purple) and by fructan 6-exohydrolase or levanase (6-FEH, depicted in light green). These enzymes hydrolyze terminal fructoses. Most plant FEHs lack invertase activity and generate one sucrose molecule as an end product. Whether real b-fructosidases (enzymes that efficiently break down fructans as well as sucrose) occur in plants is still unclear.

Most of these FEHs are strongly inhibited by sucrose in vitro [14,15] and therefore might be inactive under non-stress conditions in vivo.

All known FEHs are related to cell wall-type invertases Although a set of endo- and exo-type microbial FEHs and plant fructosyl transferases were cloned in the 1990s [2], the first plant FEHs were cloned from chicory [13,14] and wheat [15] only in the past few years. The delay in FEH cloning probably occurred because molecular biologists had focused on vacuolar invertase-like genes as

candidates for FEH. Indeed, cloning of fructosyl transferase cDNAs demonstrated that they were closely related to vacuolar invertases [2] and vacuole isolation experiments showed that fructans and fructan enzymes including fructosyl transferases and FEHs were present in the vacuole [28,29]. By purifying the native FEH enzymes from chicory and using peptide sequence information for RT­PCR-based cloning, the first FEH cDNAs were obtained. Surprisingly it was found that the derived amino acid sequences of the FEHs were highly related to cell wall invertases rather than vacuolar invertases, in spite of their reported vacuolar localization [28,29]. This indicates the weakness

of relying on sequence information alone to predict the localization of a protein. The phylogenetic tree shows that FEHs cluster in a distinct subgroup among the so-called cell wall-type invertases (Figure 1). The iso-electric point (pI) of all the FEHs characterized to date is low [16], in contrast to typical cell wall invertases that have a high pI for binding to acidic cell wall components.

Discovery of FEHs in non-fructan plants (Type B) The detection of high levels of FEH activity together with the complete absence of fructan in etiolated endive leaves (a fructan plant) [14] were suggestive of an alternative

function for FEH enzymes. These data inspired us to look for FEH activities in non-fructan plants. A major problem during industrial fructan production from chicory roots is the induction of FEHs. To overcome this problem, fructan biosynthetic genes of plant and microbial origin were introduced in several non-fructan plants such as sugar beet and potato [5,9,30] with the purpose of obtaining large-scale industrial production of tailor-made fructans [10]. Although the complete absence of FEHs in non-fructan plants has been considered as trivial for a long time, low 1-FEH activities were detected in controls (wild-type non-fructan plants) during heterologous expression studies with 1-FEHs from fructan plants [13]. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains six putative cell wall invertases (AtcwINV1­AtcwINV6, recently revised nomenclature) [31]. AtcwINV6 groups together with FEHs from fructan plants in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). It was recently demonstrated [32] that both AtcwINV3 and AtcwINV6 are not invertases but are real FEHs with different substrate specificities. AtcwINV3 is a 6-FEH and AtcwINV6 degrades both (2,1) and (2,6) linkages (a 6&1 FEH). By contrast, AtcwINV1 was found to be a typical invertase [32]. A series of non-fructan plants belonging to a variety of plant families were tested for levanase and inulinase [16]. Most of them showed considerable 6-FEH activity, suggesting that 6-FEHs are widely distributed in plants. The highest 6-FEH enzyme activity was found in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). To exclude the possibility that the activity was due to b-fructosidase or invertase, a specific 6-FEH was purified from this species. To further prove that the activity did not originate from endophytic or pathogenic bacteria or fungi, the corresponding cDNA was cloned and the functionality of the 6-FEH cDNA was further demonstrated by heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris [16]. Like the FEHs from fructan plants, a high sequence homology to plant cell wall invertases was found, excluding a microbial origin. The sugar beet 6-FEH does not cluster with the 1-FEHs from fructan plants but appears in a different subgroup that also contains AtcwINV1, AtcwINV3 and AtcwINV5 (Figure 1). Without functional identification, this enzyme would have been annotated as a cell wall invertase, illustrating the unreliability of automatic annotations and the necessity of functional analysis for new members within the group. The sugar beet 6-FEH is highly specific towards (2,6)-type fructans including levan and neokestose [16]. Similar to FEHs from fructan plants, the enzyme lacks invertase activity and has a low pI. By contrast, sugar beet 6-FEH is poorly inhibited by sucrose and enzyme activity measurements suggest a constitutive expression in sink tissues [16]. Putative functions of Type B FEHs Defense-related enzymes working on exogenous fructan substrates? The role of Type B FEHs is not obvious. Type B FEHs probably have no endogenous substrates. Indeed, no obvious fructosyl transferase genes (only two vacuolar invertase genes) are found in the Arabidopsis genome and no fructan series were detected in Arabidopsis or sugar beet [16].
www.sciencedirect.com

In contrast to Type A FEHs working on vacuolar fructans, the most plausible function for a specific Type B 6-FEH would be to degrade (and/or prevent the formation of) exogenous levan-type fructans from bacterial origin. In analogy to chitinases and b-glucanases hydrolyzing cellsurface components of fungal plant pathogens [33], it is likely that plant 6-FEHs might participate in hydrolysis of levan-containing slimes surrounding endophytic or phytopathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas or Erwinia [34,35]. These bacterial species prefer sucrose-rich environments and their extracellular levansucrase enzymes can quickly transform sucrose into levan [36], serving as a potential reserve and/or a defense-related compound. A role as a defense-related compound seems more plausible because levans form a separating layer between bacteria and plant cell wall polymers during the early phase of infection, which prevents the plant from recognizing the pathogen [34]. More direct evidence comes from the finding that Erwinia amylovora strains deficient in levansucrase are reduced in virulence [35]. During the early stages of plant­pathogen interaction, constitutively expressed 6-FEHs (like those in sugar beet) might also fulfill a crucial role by preventing levan formation and, in doing so, infection. Intriguingly, toxic effects of levans were found when bacterial levansucrases were overexpressed in non-fructan plants [30]. Therefore, it is speculated that 6-FEHs counteract bacterial levansucrases and detoxify the products they form. Interestingly, bacterial diseases are a marginal problem in sugar beet breeding and it would be interesting to find out whether this is correlated with the elevated 6-FEH activities in this species. It is further hypothesized that FEHs might be involved in stabilizing the symbiosis between plants and fructan-producing endophytic bacteria that occurs in sugar beet [37] and sugar cane [38]. Other functions on endogenous substrates? Fructans can reside in the apoplastic space of fructan plants after cold hardening [39]. These fructans might serve a role as membrane protectors. It is speculated that some Type B FEHs in fructan plants might be involved in removing these apoplastic fructans after the cold stress ceases. To date, the presence of small amounts of endogenous fructans in healthy and unstressed non-fructan plants has not been reported. However, this was also the case for trehalose, which was only recently found in minute amounts in higher plants such as Arabidopsis [40]. It is well known that invertases have the capacity to produce the three kestose trisaccharides 1-kestose, 6-kestose and neokestose in vitro from moderate or high sucrose concentrations [41]. It cannot be excluded that the production of these trisaccharides in vivo is of physiological importance, particularly under stress conditions. Intriguingly, by expressing yeast invertase in the potato sieve element companion cell complex, it has been shown that 6-kestose is produced in the leaf, loaded into the phloem and transported to the tubers [42]. The work demonstrates that invertase-derived 6-kestose transport is possible in plants that normally transport sucrose. Determining whether such transport indeed occurs in

stressed, non-transgenic plants will require further analysis. It is speculated that sucrose derivatives or homologs such as 6-kestose and trehalose act as signals captured by specific sensors. Ideally the putative fructan signal should specifically be destroyed after sensing; this could be accomplished by a highly specific enzyme such as a 6-FEH that would not attack the transported sucrose. Evolutionary speculations Initially, it came as a surprise that plant FEHs were much more similar to cell wall invertases than to vacuolar invertases. The emergence of vacuolar fructosyl transferases in plants, which probably occurred independently in dicots and monocots [2,3], led to the evolution of vacuolar FEHs with an enhanced 2,1- or 2,6-linkage specificity (Type A). Possibly this was accomplished by fusing a vacuolar targeting signal to a pre-existing, extracellular and unspecific FEH. Later, further specialization might have occurred (both in fructan and non-fructan plants) towards specific 6-FEHs and 1-FEHs. We suggest that the extracellular, low pI plant FEHs themselves have evolved from extracellular low pI b-fructosidases degrading both sucrose and fructans as found in microorganisms. Indeed, including two microbial b-fructosidases in the tree (Figure 1) shows that they cluster into the low pI cell wall subgroup. The splitting of b-fructosidase activity into FEH and invertase would have allowed independent control of sucrose and fructan concentrations and avoided interference between FEH breakdown and sucrose loading and unloading processes. Conclusion FEHs fulfill many crucial roles (energy provision, osmoregulation, stress tolerance) in fructan plants. The recent discovery and characterization of several alternative FEHs in non-fructan plants strongly suggest that FEHs are additionally involved in even more important functions, including defense and signaling, but this remains to be further demonstrated. The unexpected appearance of FEHs among cell wall invertases highlights the necessity of full functional characterization of this group.
