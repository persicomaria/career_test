The crystal structure of the esterase catalytic antibody 48G7 has been Ê determined in the presence of hapten at 2.0 A resolution and in the Ê absence of hapten at 2.7 A resolution. The root-mean-square difference Ê Ê between the two structures is 0.6 A for the variable domain and 0.7 A for the constant domain. Comparison of the active site shows that no signi®cant changes occur upon hapten binding as main-chain and side-chain displacements are negligible. Complex formation occurs as hapten Ê ®ts into a pre-formed pocket about 10 A deep. Although 151 water molecules were modeled into the 48G7-hapten structure, none are bound in the active site. Comparison of the 48G7 structures with those of other published ester hydrolysis antibodies illustrates an emerging theme used by esterolytic antibodies in binding their (nitro-)phenyl haptens and in hydrolysing their cognate esters and carbonates: hapten is bound with the aryl end buried deep in the binding pocket, and the phosphonate moiety is responsible for the majority of the binding energy to the antibody-hapten interaction.

Introduction
In 1948, Linus Pauling noted that antibodies and enzymes share certain binding characteristics, with one fundamental difference: antibodies bind the ground state con®guration of their respective antigens, while enzymes bind an ``activated'' transition state of the reaction which they catalyze (Pauling, 1948). This led Jencks (1969) to postulate that antibodies directed against transition state analogs (TSAs) might possess catalytic ability, an idea which was ®nally demonstrated in 1986 by the research groups of Schultz (Pollack et al., 1986) and Lerner (Tramontano et al., 1986). Today, ten years later, this TSA strategy has been exploited to elicit antibodies which together catalyze over 100 reactions (e.g. see Lerner et al., 1991). Despite the myriad of catalytic antibodies currently available, relatively few crystal structures have emerged for these proteins. Invariably, such studies have employed antigen-binding fragments (a Fab or FabH ) instead of the entire antibody.

The ®rst crystallographic study was reported in early 1994 when Wilson and colleagues described Ê the crystal structure to 3.0 A of the catalytic FabH 1F7, which possesses chorismate mutase activity (Haynes et al., 1994a,b). Very recently, the crystal structures of the sul®de oxidase antibody 28B4 Fab Ê Ê both with (1.9 A) and without (2.2 A) hapten have appeared (Hsieh-Wilson et al., 1996). Several crystal structures of esterolytic antibodies have now emerged. The esterolytic antibodies are the best characterized of the catalytic antibodies due in part to the availability of excellent TSAs. These proteins catalyze the hydrolysis of (nitro-) phenyl esters and/or carbonates, and presumably this reaction proceeds through a tetrahedral intermediate such as that drawn in Figure 1 for antibody 48G7. Six reports have appeared since 1994 describing the structures of ®ve different esterolytic antibodies, all of which were elicited with O-linked aryl phosphonate TSAs. Although two of these reports were modeling studies of the esterolytic Fabs NPN43C9 (Roberts et al., 1994) and 29G11, the remaining four studies were X-ray structures: antibody CNJ206 was investigated both with and Ê without bound hapten to resolutions of 3.2 A Ê , respectively (Charbonnier et al., 1995; and 3.0 A

Golinelli-Pimpaneau et al., 1994), antibody 17E8 Ê was described to 2.5 A resolution in the presence of hapten (Zhou et al., 1994), and most recently the af®nity-matured antibody 48G7 was studied with Ê bound hapten to 2.0 A resolution (Patten et al., 1996). The 48G7 antibody and its corresponding Fab have been characterized (Jacobs, 1990; Lesley et al., 1993; Patten et al., 1996). This Fab binds a number of p-nitrophenyl phosphonates including the transition state analog 4 with which it was elicited, and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the corresponding nitrophenyl esters 1a and carbonates 1b (Figure 1) with rate accelerations in excess of 104 over that of the uncatalyzed reaction. Antibody 48G7 has undergone af®nity maturation, a process whereby clonal expansion and selection of B cells results in antibodies with increased af®nities for increasingly rare antigen; this process occurs through somatic hypermutation of the antibody genes. The af®nitymatured Fab 48G7 contains nine amino acid substitutions compared to the original germline sequence. None of these nine replacements are in direct contact with the hapten, the closest being Ê His L55 5.3 A away, and thus the 1.4 Â 104 improvement in binding af®nity seen during the af®nity maturation process is due to generalized or otherwise mid or long-range effects. Although a clearer understanding of the roles of these nine mutations should emerge with further crystallographic studies on the germline antibodies, similar observations have been reported by Schildbach et al. (1993), who found that changes in binding af®nity of the digoxin-binding antibody LB4 could be brought about by even conservative replacements of non-contact residues. The abovementioned investigations have revealed a wealth of detail about the esterolytic active sites, and several models of catalysis have emerged. However, models of free antibody and antibody-hapten complexes are only available for antibody CNJ206, and thus the picture of conformational changes induced via hapten binding by esterolytic antibodies is necessarily limited. In this

report we extend the crystallographic results of the 48G7 antibody by ®rst further re®ning the structure of the 48G7-hapten complex, and then by reporting the X-ray structure of the 48G7 Fab in the absence of hapten. A comparison of the liganded and unliganded structures has afforded us a glimpse into structural changes inherent upon hapten binding.

Results and Discussion
Structure quality The data for Fab 48G7 is 80.9% complete to Ê 2.7 A, the ®nal model having an Rfactor of 0.184, an Rfree of 0.244, and unit cell dimensions of Ê Ê Ê a138.7 A, b44.5 A, c84.9 A, a90.0 , b121.7 ,  g90.0 ; the space group is C2. One residue, Asp H65, lies in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot while four residues (Asn L30, Ala L51, Asn L152 and Ser H84) lie in generously allowed regions (Figure 2A). The data for the Fab 48G7-4 Ê structure is 96.7% complete to 2.0 A, the ®nal model having an Rfactor of 0.216, an Rfree of Ê 0.247, and unit cell dimensions of a140.3 A, Ê , c85.4 A, a90.0 , b121.5 , g90.0 ; Ê b44.8 A the space group is also C2. Three residues, Ala L51, Asn L210 and Ser H127, lie in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot while two others, Lys H129 and Ser H132, lie in generously allowed regions (Figure 2B). For either model, a total of 98.6% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues lie in either most favored or additionally allowed regions. The data collection and re®nement statistics for both models are summarized in Table 1. Water molecules A total of 151 water molecules were ®tted to the 48G7-4 model, though only two (W33 and W85) Ê are within 4.5 A of the bound hapten. These water Ê molecules are 3.9 and 4.2 A, respectively, from carboxylate oxygen atoms on the solvent-exposed tail of the hapten. No water molecules were detected

Orientation of bound hapten The binding pocket of Fab 48G7 is approxiÊ Ê mately 10 A deep and 5 A wide, which is suf®cient to bury about 80% of the surface area of hapten 4 in the 48G7-4 complex. At a contouring level of 1.6s all of the hapten atoms are associated with electron density, while at 2.4s a well-de®ned torus is visible which precisely accommodates the pheÊ nyl ring (Figure 3) and places it less than 3.5 A from the Tyr L91 ring. An additional, contiguous area of density persists to contouring levels above 10s and unambiguously de®nes the position of the phosphonyl phosphorus. The orientation of the bound hapten is of critical importance in trying to understand binding and catalysis in this antibody. The electron density for the bound hapten is of a suf®ciently high quality to clearly identify and position the nitrophenyl moiety as well as the phosphonyl phosphorus. Taken together, these observations allow us to unambiguously determine that hapten 4 is bound with the nitrophenyl group buried deep in the binding pocket. This is in agreement with earlier 48G7 studies which noted that binding was unaffected when the alkyl tail was used as a linker to large carrier proteins such as bovine serum albumen, but was abolished when linkage occurred through the nitrophenyl end of the molecule (Jacobs, 1990). Interestingly, this same orientation of bound TSA relative to Fab has been seen in structural studies on two other antibodies directed against similar TSAs (Charbonnier et al., 1995; Zhou et al., 1994). In each case, the TSA is bound with its (nitro-)phenyl end buried deep in a hydrophobic pocket, while the other end remains solvent exposed.

The allowed regions are indicated by shading and letter labels: most favored regions (A,B,L (dark shade)); additional allowed regions (a,b,l (medium shading)); generously allowed regions ($a, $b, $l (light shading)); disallowed regions (unlabeled and unshaded). Glycine residues are shown as small triangles, and all other residues as small squares.

The binding pocket Ê The depth of the binding pocket in 48G7, 10 A, agrees well with the longest dimension of the combining sites of several other antibodies. Herron and co-workers, for example, reported that ¯uorescein Ê binds to Fab 4-4-20 in a cavity 9.0 A wide (Herron et al., 1989) while Fab BV04-01 binds its trinucleoÊ tide ligand in a groove 11.5 A wide (Herron et al., 1991). Similarly, Fab AN02 was reported to sandwich its dinitrophenyl ligand between two tryptoÊ È phan residues spaced 6.0 A apart (Brunger et al., 1991), Fab NQ10/12.5 binds its phenyloxazolone Ê hapten in a binding site 7.5 A long (Alzari et al., 1990), Fab TE33 binds a cholera toxin peptide in a Ê Ê groove 13 A deep and 13 A wide (Shoham, 1993), and Fab 50.1 binds a gp120 16-mer peptide in a Ê Ê long groove with dimensions 25 A long, 8 to 9 A Ê wide and 8 A deep (Rini et al., 1993). Perhaps most germane to the 48G7 structure is the size of the active site in another esterolytic antibody, CNJ206, Ê which binds its TSA in a groove 14.5 A long (Golinelli-Pimpaneau et al., 1994). It is interesting to note that in 48G7 the binding site is of the cavity type in both the uncomplexed and complexed

within the active site itself. Waters were not modeled into the 48G7 structure without hapten, although visual inspection of the active site showed no obvious bound water molecules. It is dif®cult to make generalizations about the role of water molecules in the binding process of 48G7. Our observations with the 48G7-4 complex suggest that water molecules (or at least immobilized water molecules) are excluded from the 48G7 active site during binding. It appears that complimentarity in hapten binding to 48G7 occurs without water molecules.

overlaid. Most of the movements in the main-chain atoms are relatively modest (Figure 4A and B), Ê with average rmsd values of 0.4 A for the light Ê chain and 0.5 A for the heavy. Three regions of the heavy chains have rather large backbone rmsd Ê values, at times exceeding 3.0 A (Table 2); these regions are described sequentially. (1) H25-H32, a

region which includes the ®rst two residues of the heavy chain CDR1, shows main-chain movements Ê between 2.0 and 4.0 A. These residues lie to the side of the binding pocket, just out of direct contact with the hapten (Figure 5). The region has large overall B-values in both models (48G7 model: Ê Ê 51 A2, 48G7-4 model: 73 A2), as can be seen in Figure 4E to L, and is associated with rather poor electron density. (2) H128-H133 shows backbone Ê displacements between 1.5 and 4.0 A. These residues lie on the opposite end of the molecule from the binding pocket, in a solvent-exposed region near the two C termini in the constant domain and have large overall B-values in both models (48G7 Ê Ê model: 45 A2, 48G7-4 model: 72 A2). Like the ®rst loop, this loop is associated with poor electron density. (3) Asp H65, which shows an rmsd value Ê of 2.0 A and is located on the solvent-exposed surÊ face of the protein approximately 20 A from the binding pocket. The average B-values for this resiÊ due are moderate (48G7 model, 33 A2; 48G7-4 Ê model, 24 A2). In the 48G7-4 model, a carboxylate oxygen is hydrogen bonded to a symmetry-related molecule, Lys H117, an interaction which does not occur in the free 48G7 structure (Figure 6). It is tempting to speculate that the displacements seen in heavy chain residues H25-H32 and H128H133 are a result of hapten binding. However, several lines of evidence suggest otherwise. Again, the regions have large B-values and poor electron density. Instead of binding-induced movement, they seem to simply be disordered, solvent-exposed loops. In the 48G7-4 model, the hydrogen bond to a symmetry-related Lys effectively locks the aspartate carboxylate group in place, resulting in good electron density and a reasonable B-value. This hydrogen bond is lacking in the 48G7 structure,

This Figure was produced by overlaying the 48G7 structure on the 48G7-4 structure and connecting the corresponding Ca atoms with a line. In this stereo view, light chain residues are on the left, heavy chain residues toward the right; the variable domain is on top, and the constant domain on the bottom. The hapten is shown in red.

and the side-chain ¯ip-¯ops between two alternate rotamers; both of these conformations can be seen in the electron density maps. This also explains why H65 has a lower B-value in the 48G7-4 model. Hapten-protein contacts Ê Using a maximum distance criterion of 3.5 A, a total of 13 contacts were found between bound TSA 4 and active site residues (Table 3). Seven of these contacts involve van der Waals interactions and the remainder are hydrogen bonds. Moreover, two of the contacts involve light chain framework residues, while the others involve either CDR L3, CDR H1 or CDR H3; no hapten-protein contacts were observed to CDRs L1, L2 or H2. Deep in the binding pocket, the buried nitro group on the hapten makes two van der Waals contacts with framework residues (Leu L36 Cd2 to O12 and Arg L46 Cd

to O13) and a hydrogen bond with a CDR H3 Tyr (Tyr H99 O to N11) (for numbering of TSA 4 atoms, see Figure 7, below). The phenyl ring is contacted three times by two CDR tyrosine residues, viz, Tyr L91 Cd2 to C4, Tyr L91 Cg to C4, and Tyr H99 O to C6. Although the hapten phosphorus atom makes no direct contact with the protein, the phosphonyl oxygen atoms together make seven contacts: O29 makes four contacts to three residues, involving three hydrogen bonds (Arg L96 Ne, Arg L96 NH2, Tyr H33 OH) and a van der Waals interaction (His H35 Ce1). On the other hand, O30 has three contacts to two residues (His H35 Ce1, His H35 Ne2 and Tyr H99 N). The aforementioned hydrogen bonds are in the syn orientation to the phosphonyl oxygen atoms, which represents the most favored orientation for carboxylate oxygen atoms in hydrogen bonds (Ippolito et al., 1990). The solvent-exposed aliphatic linker and terminal carboxylate group of the hapten 4 have no observable contacts to any residues in the active site area, although a carboxylate oxygen is hydrogen bonded to a symmetry-related arginine residue (Figure 6). Although there are six tyrosine residues in the active site area, strict p-p stacking interactions between hapten and protein were not observed. Structural changes in active site residues upon hapten binding Active site residues in both structures are associated with excellent electron density. Figure 8 compares the active sites of the overlaid 48G7 and 48G7-4 structures. It is clear that very little displacement of the main-chain atoms occurs upon binding. Side-chain atoms, on the other hand, do appear to move, albeit modestly. The tyrosine rings of the ``aromatic cluster'' (Patten et al., 1996)

Figure 6. Packing interactions. View of the area near the Fab 48G7-4 binding site (green) showing several interactions with Arg L211 from a symmetry-related molecule (purple); these represent the only packing Ê interactions within 15 A of the bound hapten (black). Hydrogen bonds from symmetry-related Arg NH1 to the hapten carboxylate O31 (thick dotted yellow line; Ê 2.9 A) and also to Tyr H99 OH (medium dotted yellow Ê line; 3.2 A) are shown. The potential hydrogen bond between Tyr H99 OH and symmetry-related Arg L211 NH2 is greatly weakened by distance (thin dotted yelÊ low line; 3.9 A).

near the mouth of the binding pocket, of which L91, L94 and H33 shown in Figure 8 are members, are virtually superimposable. The side-chains of the other active site residues show only slightly more exaggerated movements. The largest sidechain movement seen in the active site, and the one best supported by electron density, involves a moderate rotation (ca 30 ) of the H35 His imidazole ring. As a result of this rotation, the e-imino Ê group of His H35 is displaced 0.7 A, moving toward the pro R-phosphonyl oxygen of hapten-4 Ê and forming a hydrogen bond 2.7 A in length. The histidine side-chain is probably also constrained by a hydrogen bond to the framework residue Trp H47, a bond which is strongly conserved among antibodies (Roberts et al., 1994). Additional hydroÊ gen bonds in the active site area include a 3.4 A hydrogen bond from Met H34 Sd to Cys H22 Sg, a distance which is within the variations reported for Ê such hydrogen bonds (3.5(Æ0.1) A) by Ippolito et al. Ê (1990), Asp H56 to Arg H50 (3.0 A), and Arg H50 Ê Ne to Tyr L94 (3.1 A); this latter bond may stabilize the tyrosine side-chain of H33, a residue which is immediately adjacent to the highly mobile H25H32 region. Binding in other antibodies Atomic rearrangements in response to ligand binding have been described in other antibody studies (Colman, 1988; Webster et al., 1994; Wilson & Stan®eld, 1993, 1994) and a range of movements have been reported. In some investigations, no signi®cant changes were noted in either antigen or antibody upon antigen binding (Arevalo et al.,

1993b; Fischmann et al., 1991; Jeffrey et al., 1993). In other studies large-scale movements were seen, involving rearrangements of entire CDR loops (Herron et al., 1991; Rini et al., 1992); in some instances, these movements spanned distances up to Ê 5 A. Some workers have described even largerscale movements resulting from a shift of the VL domain relative to the VH domain; rotations of 7.5 (Herron et al., 1991) and 16 (Stan®eld et al., 1993) are known. Less dramatic changes such as small alterations in side-chain orientation and/or rearrangements in backbone atoms have also been noted (Arevalo et al., 1993a; Chitarra et al., 1993; Stan®eld et al., 1990; Tulip et al., 1992). Of particular relevance is a crystallographic study by Arevalo et al. (1994) on the anti-progesterone antibody DB3. Upon complex formation with any of ®ve structurally distinct but cross-reacting steroids, these workers found only nominal conformational changes in the DB3 binding site, and concluded that ``steroids . . . can bind in the nanomolar af®nity range to a largely unchanged FabH binding pocket''.

397 Several recent discussions have focused on whether the induced ®t model or the lock-and-key model best describes the preferred binding mode of antibodies (Webster et al., 1994; Wilson &

Backbone atoms are almost superimposable, and only minor differences in side-chain positions are seen. Note the rotation of the imidazole ring for His H35. Produced with program INSIGHT II.

This situation parallels hapten binding in Fab 48G7. The structure of the esterolytic antibody CNJ206 Ê has been solved both with hapten to 3.2 A resolution (Charbonnier et al., 1995) and without hapten Ê to 3.0 A (Golinelli-Pimpaneau et al., 1994), which presents the opportunity to examine conformational changes occurring during hapten binding in this esterolytic antibody. Formation of the CNJ206-hapten complex results in much larger displacements than those seen in 48G7. Two types of changes were noted. One involves a broad-scale pivoting of the VL domain relative to the VH domain, a displacement which can be deconvoluted into a 7 Ê rotation and a 0.9 A translation. In addition, a striking rearrangement occurs in the 11 residues of CDR H3, resulting in a change of shape of the combining site from a shallow groove to a deep pocket. Although hapten 4 is also bound in a deep binding pocket on Fab 48G7, this pocket is already present in the unliganded protein; no residue movements are required to expose or broaden the pocket during complex formation, as can be seen in Figure 9. Thus, it seems that these two antibodies employ different binding strategies which nonetheless result in their respective haptens being bound in nearly identical orientations. It is of interest that several hydrogen bonds seem to be present between CNJ206 active site residues and the TSA phsophonyl oxygen atoms, and that, as in Fab 48G7, the phosphonate moiety probably contributes most of the binding energy to the antibodyhapten interaction.

398 Stan®eld, 1993, 1994). Webster et al. (1994) have introduced the term "mutual ®t" to describe antibody-antigen complex formations whose structural changes are relatively minor, restricted to the reorientation of side-chains. We ®nd that mutual ®t, rather than either lock-and-key or induced ®t, seems to best describe binding in Fab 48G7; the hapten is simply inserted into a pre-existing, complementary pocket, perhaps with concommitant but small-scale re-orientations of some active site sidechains.

Materials and Methods
Expression, purification and sequence determination of Fab The Fab fragment, its cloning into Escherichia coli and subsequent expression and sequence determination have all been described (Jacobs, 1990; Lesley et al., 1993; Patten et al., 1996). Brie¯y, the expressed Fab was puri®ed from an E. coli periplasmic preparation by protein G af®nity chromatography, followed by ion exchange and then gel ®ltration on a Sephacryl S-100 column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) which had been equilibrated and developed with a 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM methionine, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM sodium azide buffer. Puri®ed Fab was concentrated via ultra®ltration to 10 to 15 mg protein mlÀ1 and stored at 4 C. Protein thus puri®ed was used for crystallization trials within one week. Crystallization and data collection Crystallization screens for antibody 48G7 Fab were set up in hanging drops using an incomplete factorial design (Jancarik & Kim, 1991). All protein was in the Tris buffer described above, and hapten, when present, was at a concentration of 1 mM. Each drop consisted of 2 ml of protein solution plus 2 ml of precipitating solution, with the respective wells containing 1 ml of precipitating solution. Drops were allowed to equilibrate by vapor diffusion at 4 C. Crystals appeared within a few days and continued appearing for several weeks. Several different crystal morphologies were obtained, but only plate-like crystals having ill-de®ned faces and lengths in excess of 0.5 mm diffracted adequately for data collection. The best diffracting Fab crystals and Fab-hapten co-crystals were produced with a mother liquor of 100 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0), 27% (w/v) PEG 3300. X-ray diffraction data for the 48G7 Fab crystal was collected on a single crystal maintained at 4 C on an Raxis II X-ray generator (Molecular Structures Corp., Houston, TX, USA) using CuKa radiation and a Rigaku Image Plate System (Rigaku, Japan); dimensions for this crystal were approximately 0.4 mm Â 0.4 mm Â 0.1 mm. Data were collected over 128 with 2 oscillations. Re¯ection intensities were integrated with the program DENZO version 1.3.0 (by Z. Otwinowski) and then further processed with programs of the CCP4 package version 3.0 (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994): intensities were sorted with SORTMTZ, scale factors calculated and applied with ROTAVATA and AGROVATA, and intensities truncated to amplitudes by TRUNCATE.

X-ray diffraction data for the 48G7-4 co-crystals were collected on a single crystal maintained at 4 C at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory; dimensions for this crystal were similar to the 48G7 crystal. Data were collected over 188 of rotation with 2 oscillations. Re¯ection intensities were evaluated and processed as described above. Both rotational and translational searches for 48G7-4 were performed with the program AMORE (Navaza, 1994). The search model consisted of antibody 4D5 (Eigenbrot et al., 1993) with a heavy chain CDR H3 from HyHEL-10 (Padlan et al., 1989) and a light chain CDR L3 from D1.3 (Bhat et al., 1990). Because of the ¯exibility of the elbow region, rotational searches were performed with two independent VL:VH and CL:CH1 domains; data Ê between 15 and 3 A were used. After application of the AMORE solutions, the search model was subjected to one cycle of rigid body re®nement using the program XÈ PLOR (Brunger, 1992b,c). Further details of the molecular replacement calculations are described elsewhere (Patten et al., 1996). The re®ned 48G7-4 structure, minus its hapten, was used as the starting model for the 48G7 structure; in this case, molecular replacement calculations were not necessary. The initial structure for the r-nitrophenyl phosphonate hapten was created with the program INSIGHT II (Biosym Technologies, 1992, San Diego, CA, USA) and these coordinates pasted into the model coordinate ®le. Using the graphics program O version 5.10 (Jones et al., 1991), a 1Fo À Fc omit map (see below) was overlaid on the 48G7-4 model plus hapten, and the hapten ®tted to the active site density. The X-PLOR parameter and topography ®les for the r-nitrophenyl phosphonate hapten were constructed manually. Since p-orbital overlap was expected to enforce planarity in the nitrophenyl moiety, improper angles were de®ned accordingly. The 48G7 Fab structures, with and without hapten, were obtained by model-building with program O alternating with re®nement of the atomic coordinates by standard simulated annealing protocol starting at 3000 K in X-PLOR version 3.1, until the minimization was comÈ plete (Brunger et al., 1990). During the modeling-building process, 1Fo À Fc OMIT maps were generated, the deleted regions including the hypervariable loops, N and C-terminal tails, as well as the hapten itself. Rfree was monitored throughout the model-building process È (Brunger, 1992a). All maps were constructed using the CCP4 suite of programs. In all, each model was subjected to at least three cycles of molecular dynamics followed by model-building. At this point, one ®nal round of energy minimization using X-PLOR and the complete 48G7 dataset completed that structure. The ®nal 48G7 coordinates have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under accession code 1HKL. For the 48G7-4 structure, after molecular dynamics, water molecules were selected by the CCP4 programs PEAKMAX and WATPEAK; they were inserted into the 1Fo À Fc map where electron densities were in excess of 3.0 s. The water molecules were then individually examined using program O and retained only if proper bonding geometries were observed. The 48G7-4 structure was then completed as per the 48G7 structure, using one ®nal round of energy minimization and the complete 48G7-4 dataset. All processing and re®nement calculations were carried out on Silicon Graphics workstation. Computer-generated graphics were created using either MOLSCRIPT version 1.4 (Kraulis, 1991), O or INSIGHT II, transferred

Crystal Structure of Esterase Catalytic Antibody to an Apple PowerPC 7100 (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA, USA) and processed further using either Adobe PHOTOSHOP version 3.5 or ILLUSTRATOR version 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA). All graphs were created with KALEIDAGRAPH version 2.1.3 (Abelbeck Software) and CANVAS version 3.5 (Deneba Systems, Inc., Miami, FL, USA). Structure analysis The sequence numbers used for both structures are in accordance with the numbering scheme presented by Kabat et al. (1991). Visual inspection of the models was accomplished with the programs O and INSIGHT II. PROCHECK version 2.1.4 (Laskowski et al., 1993) was used to check the stereochemistries of both models, and crystal packing and intermolecular contacts were calculated with X-PLOR using a hydrogen bonding cut-off raÊ dius of 3.5 A and a van der Waals contact radius of up Ê to 4.07 A depending on atom type (Sheriff et al., 1987). Root-mean-square differences between the structures were computed with X-PLOR. The hydrogen bond geometries are consistent with those described by either Jeffrey & Saenger (1991) or Ippolito et al. (1990).
