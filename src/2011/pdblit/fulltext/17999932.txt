The genome of the opportunistic pathogen Clostridium perfringens encodes a large number of secreted glycoside hydrolases. Their predicted activities indicate that they are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and other glycans found in the mucosal layer of the human gastrointestinal tract, within the extracellular matrix, and on the surface of host cells. One such group of these enzymes is the family 84 glycoside hydrolases, which has predicted hyaluronidase activity and comprises five members [C. perfringens glycoside hydrolase family 84 (CpGH84) A­E]. The first identified member, CpGH84A, corresponds to the -toxin whose modular architecture includes an N-terminal catalytic domain, four family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules, three FIVAR modules of unknown function, and a C-terminal putative calcium-binding module. Here, we report the solution NMR structure of the C-terminal modular pair from the -toxin. The three-helix bundle FIVAR module displays structural homology to a heparin-binding module within the N-terminal of the a C protein from group B Streptoccocus. The C-terminal module has a typical calcium-binding dockerin fold comprising two anti-parallel helices that form a planar face with EF-hand calcium-binding loops at opposite ends of the module. The size of the helical face of the -toxin dockerin module is approximately equal to the planar region recently identified on the surface of a cohesin-like X82 module of CpGH84C. Size-exclusion chromatography and heteronuclear NMR-based chemical shift mapping studies indicate that the helical face of the dockerin module recognizes the CpGH84C X82 module. These studies represent the structural characterization of a noncellulolytic dockerin module and its interaction with a cohesin-like X82 module. Dockerin/ X82-mediated enzyme complexes may have important implications in the pathogenic properties of C. perfringens.

Introduction
Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive sporeforming anaerobic bacterium that is found in soil and in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals.1,2 It is also an opportunistic pathogen that is responsible for gas gangrene, necrotic enteritis, and food poisoning in humans.3,4 C. perfringens produces an arsenal of exotoxins, defined as major and minor, based on their lethality in mice.5,6 The pathogenic properties of the major toxins involve disruption of the target cell membrane or modification of host cell cytoskeletal

integrity.7 In contrast, many minor toxins are carbohydrate-active glycoside hydrolases, and their conspicuous role in infection appears to involve degradation of other complex glycans, such as the mucosal layer of the human gastrointestinal tract, which comprises a group of highly hydrated glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans found throughout the body, and other cellular glycans. 7 Indeed, the genomes of the myonecrotic C. perfringens strains 138 and ATCC 131249 contain 54 and 52 glycoside hydrolases, respectively. The -toxin is a minor toxin that has been implicated in the onset and progression of gas gangrene due to its ability to degrade hyaluronan,10 an important constituent of connective tissue comprising linked glucuronic acid and N-acetyl glucosamine moieties. Encoded by the nagH gene,11 the -toxin enhances the ability of C. perfringens and toxin to propagate through the infected tissue.12 Annotation of the opening reading frames of the C. perfringens strain 13 genome identified five members of the family 84 glycoside hydrolases [C. perfringens glycoside hydrolase family 84 (CpGH84) A­E], of which the -toxin was the founding member.8,13 The -toxin is a 182-kDa multimodular protein comprising an N-terminal catalytic module, four family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules§, three putative carbohydrate-binding FIVAR modules (Pfam accession no. PF07554), and a C-terminal putative calcium-binding module displaying sequence similarity to dockerin modules (Fig. 1). Dockerin modules have only previously been characterized

within cellulosome-degrading enzyme complexes of anaerobic bacteria, where they mediate the assembly and cell surface attachment of these multienzymes complexes via high-affinity noncovalent interactions with cohesin modules.14­16 The presence of this dockerin-like sequence16,17 and a recently reported cohesin-like X82 module18,19 within C. perfringens glycoside hydrolases suggests that these enzymes may form complexes that allow for complementary or enhanced activities and may play an important role in the pathogenicity of C. perfringens. In this study, we present the NMR solution structure of FIVAR­dockerin modular pair from the C-terminus of the -toxin in the calcium-bound form. The FIVAR module comprises a three-helix bundle that displays structural homology to the heparinbinding module from the N-terminus of  C protein (NtACP) from group B Streptococcus. 20 The Cterminal module has a fold typical of cellulolytic dockerin modules,21­24 where two EF-hand calciumbinding loops are located at opposite ends of the two anti-parallel helices within the module. NMR-based chemical shift mapping studies indicated that the -toxin dockerin module interacts with the CpGH84C X82 module via its exposed helical face.

Results and Discussion
Ca2 +-induced effects on the conformation of the C-terminal region of C. perfringens -toxin Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed to assess the effects of calcium on the structural properties of the -toxin C-terminal modular pair. Comparison of the far-UV CD spectra in the

1204 absence and in the presence of calcium reveals a decrease in ellipticity at 222 nm and an increase in ellipticity at 208 nm and below 200 nm upon addition of calcium, amounting to a 5% increase (from 35 to 40%) in helical content within this construct (Fig. 2a). This spectral change suggests that the modular pair has substantial helical structure in the apo form and that the binding of calcium induces additional helical structure. Alternatively, the binding of calcium may cause a reorientation of existing helices. With respect to the putative dockerin module in this construct, these observations are similar to that observed previously for the CelA type I dockerin module from Clostridium cellulolyticum, which retained helical structure in the absence of calcium,25 and are in contrast to those observed for the type I and type II dockerin modules from Clostridium thermocellum, which both displayed calcium-induced folding events.26,27 Heteronuclear NMR relaxation experiments were performed to assess the dynamic properties of the Cterminal modular pair of the -toxin. Using the

Dockerin module from Clostridium perfringens -toxin

completed chemical shift assignments previously obtained and reported for this construct,17 steady state {1H}­15N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) values were analyzed for 94 of 140 expected backbone amide proton resonances and plotted as a function of residue number (Fig. 2b). Overall, the protein is well-ordered based on an average { 1 H}­ 15 N NOE value of 0.78 ± 0.16, with the exception of residues at the N-terminus and the C-terminal hexa-histidine fusion tag (Leu-Glu-His6), which undergo motion on the nanosecond to picosecond timescale. Other residues in the core of the protein that are also undergoing motion on this timescale are Lys1499 and Thr1604. Solution structure of the -toxin C-terminal modular pair The solution structure of the C-terminal modular pair of the C. perfringens -toxin in the calcium-bound form was solved using 3081 distance-derived restraints and 83 TALOS-derived dihedral restraints.28 Sixty-three of the 200 structures generated were accepted with no NOE violations greater than 0.3 Å and no dihedral violations greater than 5°. An ensemble of the 20 lowest-energy structures was selected for further analysis (Fig. 3a), and an average structure from this ensemble was calculated and minimized against experimental restraints (Fig. 3b). A summary of structural statistics is shown in Table 1. The solution structure of the -toxin C-terminal modular pair has an overall dimension of 58 Å×25 Å×22 Å, comprises two helical modules (Fig. 3) (each of which is described in more detail below), and is consistent with the percentage of helical structure predicted by the CD data. The modular pair structure is well-ordered, with the exception of Lys1499 at the N-terminus, which lacks medium-range and longrange NOEs and displays a {1H}­15N NOE value of 0.64. In addition, the N-terminal methionine residue and the C-terminal eight-residue region from the hexa-histidine tag of the expression plasmid are also disordered. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) values of the ensemble core (defined by residues Lys1499-Asn1628) from the energy-minimized average structure for backbone and heavy atoms are 0.58 ± 0.11 Å and 0.97 ± 0.09 Å, respectively. When two modules are best fitted individually, the rmsd values for the backbone and heavy atoms of the FIVAR module (Lys1499-Thr1577) are 0.40 Å and 0.89 Å, respectively, while the rmsd values for the backbone and heavy atoms of the dockerin-like module (Gly1578-Asn1628) are 0.53 Å and 0.97 Å, respectively. The similarity between the rmsd values for the individual modules and the rmsd values for the entire modular pair is consistent with an overall rigid structure. This is supported by the presence of a modular interface between the FIVAR and dockerin modules of the -toxin and involves Phe1520, His1526, Lys1527, Ser1570, and Ile1573 of the FIVAR module, and Leu1608, Asn1609, Lys1610, Glu1616, Tyr1617, Ser1620, and Phe1621 of the dockerin module (Fig. 4).

This is a rigid well-ordered interface that contributes to the overall extended structure of the modular pair. An extended modular pair structure of the X-module and type II dockerin module and associated interface, albeit more extensive, from C. thermocellum has also recently been observed.21 When combined with the observations made in this study, it appears that intermodular interfaces involving dockerin modules and their adjacent protein modules may be a general phenomenon for dockerin-containing multimodular proteins. Description of the -toxin FIVAR module The FIVAR module forms a left-handed three-helix bundle that is stabilized by several hydrophobic contacts made between 1 (Lys1499-Glu1515), 2 (Ala1529-Phe1544), and 3 (Glu1553-Leu1571). 1 and 3 are in a parallel orientation and are antiparallel with 2, with 1 lying across 2 and 3 (Fig. 3b). The hydrophobic core formed by the three helices comprises Leu1502, Leu1505, Ile1506, Leu1512, and Leu1513 of 1; Leu1533, Ile1537, and Val1543 of 2; and Ile1554, Leu1561, Ile1565, and Phe1568 of 3. In addition, Tyr1525, Phe1568, and Leu1571 appear to contribute to the order in this region. FIVAR modules have been generally annotated as putative yet uncharacterized sugar-binding modules in a variety of pathogenic bacteria.29­31 In an attempt to elucidate a biological function for the -toxin FIVAR module, a structural homology search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the coordinates of the

-toxin FIVAR energy-minimized average NMR structure was performed using the DALI search engine.32 Notable structural similarity to the threehelix bundle module in the NtACP from group B Streptococcus was observed (Fig. 5a; Z-score of 5.7 and backbone rmsd value of 3.81 Å).20 In addition to overall similar folds, several of the core residues of the FIVAR module are either conserved or conservatively substituted to other nonpolar residues in the core of the NtACP three-helix bundle (Fig. 5b). This latter module was shown to bind to the negatively charged glucosaminoglycan heparin through a contiguous patch of basic amino acids on one face. The 5Å to 6-Å spacing between the positively charged patches is consistent with the spacing of the repeating sulfate groups of heparin (Fig. 5c). The analogous face of the FIVAR module does not have a similar positively charged pattern. However, rotation of the FIVAR module by 180° does reveal four positively charged patches on the 1­2 face, corresponding to Lys1499, Lys1510, Lys1527, and Lys1530 (Fig. 5d). While the 13-Å spacing between patches in the FIVAR module appears too large to accommodate the repeating sulfate groups on heparin, it is possible that the face recognizes other negatively charged polysaccharides. Description of the -toxin dockerin module The -toxin C-terminal module (Gly1578-Asn1628) has a typical dockerin fold, with two loop­helix

large number of hydrophobic contacts involving residues Phe1580, Met1593, Val1594, Ile1598, Leu1606, Leu1608, Ile1614, Ile1622, and Ile1626 stabilize the dockerin structure. Comparison of the -toxin and cellulolytic dockerin modules Structural overlays of the -toxin dockerin module with the uncomplexed C. thermocellum CelS type I dockerin module24 (Fig. 6a; backbone rmsd of 4.69 Å) and the C. thermocellum Xyn10B type I22,23 (Fig. 6b; backbone rmsd of 2.25 Å) and type II21 (Fig. 6c; backbone rmsd of 2.34 Å) dockerin modules, in complex with their respective cohesin modules, indicate that the -toxin dockerin module adopts an overall fold similar to that of the cellulolytic dockerin modules. The structural differences between the NMR-derived uncomplexed C. thermocellum type I dockerin module24 and the -toxin dockerin module presented here can be attributed to differences in helical orientation and conformation of the intervening linker regions, while the helices of the C. thermocellum CelS dockerin module are more displaced from one another than those in the -toxin dockerin module in a characteristic anti-parallel arrangement, in directions both parallel (8 Å) and perpendicular (3 Å) to the helical axis. In addition, 5 of the dockerin module extends to the C-terminus of the -toxin sequence, which is similar to the C. thermocellum dockerin structures when in complex with their respective cohesin modules.21­23 The 20-residue linker region in the C. thermocellum CelS dockerin module,24 which connects the two Fhand motifs, adopts a substantially different conformation from the analogous eight-residue linker region of the -toxin dockerin module. This is, in part, due to the presence of the FIVAR module and the corresponding intermodular interface, which involves residues for the -toxin dockerin linker region. The differences between the -toxin dockerin structure and the complexed C. thermocellum type I dockerin structure arise from the linker region in C. thermocellum type I dockerin, which comprises a short helix that is not present in the -toxin dockerin structure. Comparison of the -toxin dockerin module with the C. thermocellum type II dockerin module revealed small differences in the length of the C-terminal helix (10 residues in C. thermocellum type II and 12 residues in -toxin) and positioning of the calcium-binding loops with respect to the exiting helices of the F-hand motifs. In both cases, the observed structural deviations are likely a result of ligand-induced structural changes in the dockerin module, but we cannot rule out that they also, in part, arise from a comparison of a solution NMRderived structure to X-ray crystal structures.

a TALOS-derived dihedral restraints for residues located in secondary structure elements were used when 9 of 10 predictions fell in the same region of the Ramachandran plot, with the resulting  and  angles restricted to two times the error from the TALOS output for the structure calculations. b The following parameters were used: high-temperature annealing: force constants of 150 kcal mol- 1 Å- 2 for NOE energy and 100 kcal mol- 1 rad- 2 for dihedral energy; first slow cooling: 150 kcal mol- 1 Å- 2 for NOE energy and 200 kcal mol- 1 rad- 2 for dihedral energy; second slow cooling: 150 kcal mol- 1 Å- 2 for NOE energy and 200 kcal mol- 1 rad- 2 for dihedral energy; final minimization using Powell method: 75 kcal mol- 1 Å- 2 for NOE energy and 400 kcal mol- 1 rad- 2 for dihedral energy. Quadratic harmonic potential terms, with force constants of 1000 kcal mol- 1 Å- 2, 500 kcal mol- 1 rad- 2, and 500 kcal mol- 1 rad- 2 for bond, angular, and improper terms, respectively, were used to maintain covalent geometry close to ideality.

motifs (4: Asp1587-Ile1598; 5: Tyr1617-Asn1628) separated by an eight-residue linker region (Gly1599Leu1606). Residues at position 1 (Asp1579, Asp1607), position 3 (Asn1581, Asn1609), position 5 (Asn1583, Asp1611), position 7 (Lys1585, Ser1613), position 9 (Asp1587, Asp1615), and position 12 (Asp1590, Glu1618) of each of the canonical 12-residue EFhand calcium-binding loops (I: Asp1579-Asp1590; II: Asp1607-Glu1618) are in an orientation that coordinates each of the calcium ions in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration. The positioning of the calcium-binding loops, situated at opposite ends of the module, is in contrast with typical eukaryotic EFhand proteins, where an intimate association exists between the two calcium-binding loops,33,34 and is due to the two F-hand motifs being orientated in an anti-parallel arrangement. The helices of the -toxin dockerin module are well-defined, both individually (backbone rmsd values of 0.27 Å and 0.45 Å for 4 and 5, respectively) and when fitted as a unit (backbone rmsd value of 0.51 Å). An interhelical angle between 4 and 5 of 14° exists, with the helical axis of 5 directed away from the intervening linker region. A

hydrolase CpGH84C,19 raise the possibility that C. perfringens has the ability to form extracellular dockerin/ X82-mediated enzyme complexes in a manner similar to cellulolytic bacteria.14,16 Notably, the surface area of the helical face of the -toxin dockerin module (at  370 Å2) matches the size (380 Å2) of the planar region on the 9a-8-3-6-5 face of the cohesin-like CpGH84C X82 module.19 We used size-exclusion chromatography and NMR chemical shift mapping to determine whether the -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair interacts with the CpGH84C X82 module. The size-exclusion elution profile of a 1:1.5 mixture of -toxin FIVAR­ dockerin modular pair and CpGH84C X82 displayed two peaks eluting at 64.8 mL and 74.0 mL (Fig. 7a, 1 and 2), corresponding to molecular masses of 46.4 kDa and 21.8 kDa, respectively. These masses correspond well with those expected for a 1:1 -toxin FIVAR­dockerin:CpGH84C X82 complex (32.9 kDa) and the isolated CpGH84C X82 module (17.4 kDa). The difference in the calculated and observed molecular masses of the FIVAR­dockerin:CpGH84C X82 complex may be attributed to an extended structure, as would be expected given the elongated structure of the -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair presented here. SDS-PAGE analysis corroborated that the first elution peak contained both constructs, when compared to the migration of the purified isolated constructs (Fig. 7a, inset). This elution profile is similar to that previously observed for the type II dockerin­cohesin complex from C. thermocellum26-- an interaction shown to display a dissociation

constant (Kd) of 10- 9­10- 11 M,21,36 suggesting that the interaction between the -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair and CpGH84C X82 also occurs with very high affinity. Heteronuclear NMR-based chemical shift mapping studies were subsequently employed in an attempt to map the CpGH84C X82 binding site on the -toxin FIVAR­dockerin structure. Comparison of the backbone amide proton and 15N chemical shifts of the -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair in the absence and in the presence of the CpGH84C X82 module on a per-residue basis revealed that those residues displaying significant chemical shift changes were localized to dockerin module (Fig. 7b and c, blue). Specifically, Ile1588, Gly1589, Asp1590, Leu1591, Ala1592, Lys1596, Asn1597, and Ile1598 of the first dockerin helix (4); Ile1614 of the second calcium-binding loop (Ile1614); and Ser1620 of the second dockerin helix (5) all displayed chemical shift changes greater than 1 SD above the mean change in chemical shift (Fig. 6b, blue). Additional residues displaying notable chemical shift changes (above the mean change in chemical shift change, but by less than 1 SD; purple) were also primarily localized to the dockerin module (first calciumbinding loop: Asn1581, Gly1582, Ile1586, Asp1587; linker region: Gly1599, Thr1601-Leu1606; second calcium-binding loop: Asp1607, Gly1612, Ser1613, Asp1615-Tyr1617; 5: Ile1619, Phe1621, Ile1622, Asn1628). However, notable chemical shift changes were also observed for FIVAR residues located at the intermodular interface (Lys1527, Ser1576), at the C-

terminus of 1 (Ser1511, Leu1512), and at the Nterminus of 2 (Asp1531). All of the residues are in close proximity to the dockerin module and have potential to be affected by subtle X82-induced effects on the dockerin structure, with the exception of Glu1547, which is at the opposite end of the FIVAR module and displays a chemical shift change slightly above the mean change. The peak corresponding to Glu1547 in the 1H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum has been shown to be very sensitive to sample conditions, which may account for its observed chemical shift change. When considering the dockerin structure determined here (Fig. 3), how it compares to the cellulolytic dockerin structures (Fig. 6), and the extent of the chemical shift changes observed for residues

throughout the module (Fig. 7), it appears that, upon interaction with the X82 module, there is a subtle conformational change similar to that observed for the C. thermocellum type I dockerin module.23 Biological implications C. perfringens relies on a large number of minor toxins to accentuate the pathogenic properties of the major toxins.5­7 There holds an emerging theme that many of these minor toxins are carbohydrate-active enzymes and are responsible for glycan degradation and metabolism in the virulence of C. perfringens. The -toxin is one such enzyme, which has been proposed to enhance the propagation of C. perfringens and its associated

1210 major toxins through infected tissue by breaking down the extracellular matrix. The work presented here points to the formation of a glycoside hydrolase (minor toxin) complex by C. perfringens through a dockerin/X82-mediated mechanism that would allow these enzymes to work in concert on host tissues by virtue of the enhanced adherence and the synergistic action of complementary enzyme specificities.

NMR spectroscopy and structure calculations All multidimensional NMR experiments were acquired on a sample of 1.1 mM 13C/15N FIVAR­dockerin modular pair in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, and 90% H2O/10% D2O at 25 °C. Sequential backbone and sidechain chemical shift assignments were completed as previously described.17 Three-dimensional 15N NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) HSQC and 13C NOESY HSQC datasets, with 100-ms mixing times to measure interproton distances, were recorded on a Varian INOVA 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe. All spectra were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe38 and NMRViewJ,39 respectively. A simulated annealing protocol employing 20,000 steps in the first cooling stage, 2000 Cartesian steps in the second cooling stage, and 10 cycles of 1000 minimization steps was used to generate 200 structures of the -toxin FIVAR­ dockerin modular pair in CNS 1.1.40 Interproton distances were extrapolated from NOE peak intensities and calibrated for known distances in -helical regions (d,n+3, d,n+4) and loop regions (dn,n). A total of 3081 NOE-derived distance restraints were obtained for structure calculations, including 1143 sequential, 1130 medium-range (1b |i - j|  5), and 808 long-range (|i - j| N 5) distance restraints. Backbone dihedral angle restraints for 83 residues were obtained from the analysis of 13C, 13Câ, 13C, 1H, and 15N chemical shifts using the program TALOS.28 Twenty low-energy structures with no distance violations greater than 0.3 Å and no angle violations greater than 5° were accepted into the final ensemble, and the quality of the structures was evaluated using PROCHECK41 and MOLMOL.42 Steady-state {1H}­15N heteronuclear NOE data were collected on a 600-MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer with and without 3 s of proton saturation and with a total recycle delay of 7 s. {1H}­15N NOE values were calculated from the ratio of peak intensities with and without proton saturation for 94 well-resolved resonances. {1H}­15N NOE was processed using NMRPipe38 and analyzed using NMRView 5.0.4.39 1 H­15N HSQC, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and 15N NOESY HSQC (mixing time, 150 ms) datasets of 0.7 mM 13 C/15N -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair in the presence of 0.75 mM unlabeled CpGH84C X82 module were recorded at 37 °C on a Varian INOVA 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe. Sample buffer conditions included 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 90% H2O/10% D2O. Datasets were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe38 and NMRViewJ,39 respectively. All structure figures were generated using PyMOL.43 Structural similarity searches were performed using the DALI web server, 32 and sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW.44 Data Bank accession codes Chemical shift assignments for -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair have been submitted to the BioMagResBank (accession no. 7269). NMR restraints and structure coordinates for the -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair were submitted to the PDB as accession no. 2JNK.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant protein expression and purification Unlabeled and uniformly 13C/15N­labeled -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair (comprising residues 1498­ 1628) and unlabeled CpGH84C X82 were expressed and purified as C-terminal and N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins, respectively, as previously described.17,18 Protein samples were buffer-exchanged into 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM CaCl2, and stored at 4 °C. All experiments detailed below were performed on the constructs containing their respective His6 tags. CD spectroscopy Far-UV CD spectra of 111 M FIVAR­dockerin modular pair in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and of 134 M FIVAR­ dockerin modular pair in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl2 were recorded from 260 nm to 185 nm using an Olis DSM 1000 rapid-scanning monochromator fitted with a CD module and a 0.1-mm path length at 20 °C. For each sample, 10 scans were collected, averaged, and corrected with the spectra obtained from the respective buffers under identical conditions. The molar ellipticity [] was calculated according to the formula [] =  × 100/(nlc), where n is the number of amino acid residues in the protein construct, l is the path length (cm), and c is the millimolar concentration of the -toxin FIVAR­dockerin construct that was used to create a plot of [] as a function of wavelength. Deconvolution of the CD spectra to obtain the percentage of the secondary structure of the FIVAR­dockerin modular pair in the absence and in the presence of calcium was performed using CONTINLL.37 Size-exclusion chromatography Analytical size-exclusion chromatography of a mixture of 1.5 mM CpGH84C X82 and 1.0 mM -toxin FIVAR­dockerin modular pair was carried out at 20 °C on a Superdex 75 column connected to an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatographic system (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences). The running buffer was 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl2. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL min- 1, with 2-mL fractions collected and with the optical density of the eluent monitored at 280 nm. Molecular masses M were determined from a plot of logM versus Ve/Vo (Ve = elution volume and Vo = void volume). The standard curve was generated from the following Bio-Rad sizeexclusion protein standards (M, elution volume): thyroglobulin (670 kDa, 43.4 mL), bovine -globulin (158 kDa, 50.2 mL), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa, 64.1 mL), equine
