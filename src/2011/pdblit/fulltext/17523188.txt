ABSTRACT Murine Pactolus is a neutrophil-specific single chain glycoprotein that plays a role as an apoptosis marker for macrophages. The extracellular region of the protein shows strong sequence similarities to integrin b-subunits. Critical sequence modifications differentiate its function when compared to the integrin family. We show experimentally that Pactolus I-domain does not bind divalent metal ions, indicating that ligand binding is not mediated through a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). NMR data was used to map secondary structure and the strand pairing within the b-sheet to confirm an overall Rossmann fold topology. Homology modeling enhanced by the NMR data was used to determine the overall structure, with two key loop insertions/ deletions (insertion 2 and SDL) that distinguish the Pactolus I-domain from the integrin a I-domain and b I-domains. NMR peak exchange broadening is observed due to dimerization, correlating to the b I-domain and b propeller heterodimerization region within the integrin headpiece. Two unique N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn151 and Asn230) within this region disrupt dimerization and may account for why Pactolus is not found to associate with an a-subunit. These changes in quaternary structure, ligand binding loops, glycosylation, and metal sites illustrate how evolution has rapidly and effectively altered key aspects of the integrin bsubunit to derive a protein of novel function on an existing protein scaffold.

INTRODUCTION Pactolus was first characterized from mice as a glycoprotein expressed in developing bone marrow cells and stored in cytoplasmic granules that are translocated to the cell surface after neutrophil activation.1,2 Pactolus gene is expressed solely in bone marrow cells. Anti-Pactolus antibody screening and gene transcript level of Pactolus shows that maturing and mature neutrophils are the only cells that express Pactolus.1 The 98 kDa form is expressed and presented on the cell surface, while the 130 kDa form of the Pactolus remains in secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm after expression.3 Activation of the neutrophil by the immune response leads to the shuttling of this form to the cell surface, either as a necrosis signal for macrophages or to interact with another neutrophil.4 Pactolus expression helps retain CXCL13-expressing cells at the site of inflammation, with CXCL13 cytokine expression being enhanced by Pactolus expression. However, Pactolus-deficient neutrophils are not preferentially attacked by CXCL13 expressing macrophages.4 The Pactolus gene is found on mouse chromosome 16 and shares transcriptional control with its evolutionary paralogues, the b2- and b7-integrin subunits5 that are located on chromosome 10. Three variants of Pactolus proteins are generated either with or without a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail by alternative splicing mechanisms.6 Pactolus is heavily N-linked glycosylated, increasing the apparent molecular weight of the full length protein from 81 kDa to either 98 or 130 kDa.3 This evolutionary similarity to the integrin b-subunits is particularly apparent in the I-domain in the N-terminal region, with a 60% sequence homology to the integrin b2- and b7-subunits. However, unlike the integrins, it is not found to associate with an a-subunit.1,6 There are also key changes in the sequence of the Pactolus I-domain for each of the three identified integrin b I-domain metal binding sites. The most significant is the presence of a D/G variation for the first residue of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) DXSXS motif, which is likely to affect divalent metal binding.7,8 The MIDAS mediates the direct coordination of the integrin I-domain to a carboxyl group in its target ligand. Moreover, residues are not conserved for the ADjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) (a

DD/GH variant) and LIMBS metal sites (a D/N variant).9,10 A search of Genbank indicates that a predicted gene (XM_577174) present for Rattus norvegicus is similar to Pactolus, and that it contains a similarly mutated MIDAS sequence. Like the integrin a I-domain, the Pactolus I-domain also lacks the specificity determining loop (SDL), which is a significant determinant of ligand-binding specificity for the integrin b-subunit.11 Within the Rossmann fold of the b I-domain, the SDL region consists of an $30residue disulfide-bridged loop between the b2 and b3 strands.1,6,12 Recent studies13 also conclude that the SDL is responsible for defects in integrin b-subunit expression and folding in the absence of a-subunits. Deletion of the SDL, thus mimicking Pactolus, enables autonomous folding of integrin b-subunits. In this paper, we use NMR experimental data to enhance modeling of the Pactolus I-domain and to investigate how changes in the key determinants of integrin function have affected the Rossmann fold scaffold.

The recombinant Pactolus I-domain gene used for these studies corresponds to amino acid residues 124­333 of the Pactolus gene (Genebank Accession #AF051367). This domain was kindly supplied by Prof. Yoshikazu Takada (UC-Davis) and was inserted into pET28a with an N-terminal 6His affinity tag. Recombinant Pactolus Idomain was transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RP cells (Stratagene, Inc.), and the cells were grown at 378C. The samples were prepared in minimal medium containing M9 salts, supplemented with 13 BME Vitamins solution (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 g/L D-glucose and induced with IPTG (1 mM) when OD600 nm ¼ 0.6 and incubated at 378C overnight. For isotopically labeled samples, 15NH4Cl, (15NH4)2SO4, and [13C6]D-glucose (Isotech Laboratories) were used as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. For the triple-labeled sample, 99.7% TM 2 H2O replaced standard milli-Q H2O. Up to 80 mg/L protein by SDS PAGE expressed as inclusion bodies. A harvested cell pellet from 1 L of culture was resuspended in 13 PBS and lysed by sonication, and the homogenate was centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended and washed an additional three times. The washed pellet was solubilized overnight at 48C in 6M urea, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and centrifuged at $10,000g for 30 min, then filtered (0.45 lm) and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare). Bound protein then was eluted with solubilization buffer and 250 mM imidazole prior to overnight dialysis at 48C against refolding buffer [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl]. The recovered dialyzate was centrifuged to remove any precipitate present, concentrated to 2 mL

The Pactolus I-domain fractions corresponding to the monomer were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon (Millipore) device. For NMR data acquisition, a 0.5 mM sample of purified and uniformly isotopically labeled Pactolus I-domain was prepared in 10 mM dTris (pH 6.8), 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, and 5% 2H2O, with a Shigemi microcell employed for each sample.

NMR titration with Mg2+, Ca2+

Chelex deionized buffers were prepared largely as described,14 with all labware used for these procedures (and in subsequent handling of samples) pretreated with EDTA. Samples were prepared in ion-free water containing 20 mM dTris (pH 6.9) for both NMR titrations and ITC. A 250 lM 13C/15N-labeled cation-free sample of the Pactolus I-domain was titrated with 5 mM CaCl2, For the Mg2þ titrations, a 200 lM 1H/15N-labeled sample of cation-free Pactolus I-domain was titrated with 5 mM MgCl2. For all titrations, changes were observed by acquisition of the 1H/15N HSQC spectra on a DRX 600 MHz Bruker spectrometer at 298 K by four scans per increment.

subsequent structure calculations. Pseudoatom expansion corrections were applied where stereo assignments were not determined. For the amide exchange experiments, a 0.25 mM sample of 13C/15N-labeled Pactolus I-domain in 10 mM dTris (pH 6.8), 0.05% NaN3 was prepared and buffer exchanged into 10 mM dTris (pH 6.8), 100% 2H2O by using NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare). A series of 1H/15N HSQC spectra of the 2H2O sample were acquired after 5 min, 1, 6, and 24 h to identify amide protons that were resistant to deuterium exchange. Hydrogen bond donor protons were paired with likely acceptor partners from NOE and H/D exchange, and these were included in the subsequent structure calculations as distance restraints.
w and u restraints based on deviation from random coil chemical shifts

Size exclusion chromatography of the 15N-labeled Pactolus I-domain NMR sample was performed using in the Sephadex-75 Size exclusion column with a mobile phase of 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl at 48C, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Phenomenex size exclusion molecular weight standards (Cat. #ALO3042) were used to calibrate the size exclusion retention time versus logarithm of molecular weight. Molecular weights of the 15N-labeled Pactolus I-domain NMR sample were calculated using retention times of the sample OD280 nm peaks based on a previously prepared standard curve.
NMR assignments

A correlation between backbone w and u dihedral angles and the deviation from random coil 13Ca chemical shift values and the chemical shift index (CSI) has been demonstrated.24,25 Each residue's CSI was calculated using a weighted CSI program, written by Kyoko Yap (http://nmr.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ikura/csi/), that incorporates both the 13Ca and 13Cb shifts for residue (i) and neighboring residues (iÆ1) by following equation:
CSI ¼ d½CaðiÀ1Þ À CbðiÀ1Þ  þ 2d½CaðiÞ À CbðiÞ  þ d½Caðiþ1Þ À Cbðiþ1Þ  4

Sequential backbone resonance assignments were carried out using isotopically 2H/13C/15N- and 13C/15Nlabeled samples of the Pactolus I-domain using throughbond triple resonance methods. These data sets included HNCA,15,16 HN(CO)CA,15,16 HNCACB,17,18 HN(CO)CACB,17,18 HNCO,15,16 HN(CA)CO,15,16 on a Bruker 800 MHz spectrometer at 298 K equipped with a TXI probe. An additional HN(CA)CO data set was acquired using a cryogenic probe courtesy of Bruker Biospin. Data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe19 and NMRView.20

where dCb and dCa are the 13C chemical shifts minus the average 13Ca or 13Cb random coil chemical shifts for that residue type. Dihedral angle restraints were used during structure calculations for residues that could be defined as belonging to either a or b secondary structure from the CSI data. These restraints were applied as À150 u À20, À80 w 20 for a-helical regions; and as À180 u À40, 50 w À150 for b-sheet regions.
Calculation of NMR-enhanced models

Interproton distance restraints were obtained from H/15N HSQC­NOESY­HSQC21,22 and CN­NOESY23 spectra with a 150 ms mixing time. Partial side chain assignments were determined by analysis of the CNNOESY to give Ha, Hb, and HN proton resonances. Because of homodimerization of the Pactolus I-domain and the necessity for the sample to be deuterated, few side chain proton assignments could be determined. Assigned NOE peaks were incorporated as either strong ° ° ° (>2.8 A), medium (>3.5 A), or weak (>5.0 A) into the

Using the torsion angle dynamics program DYANA,26 200 structures were calculated with the experimentally derived restraints, with the 100 lowest energy further refined by homology modeling with Modeller8v2,27 where the b3 I-domain (residues Pro111 to Ser353) from the aVb3 crystal structure (pdb#1JV2) was used as a template. This was necessary for regions where NMR exchange broadening gave little NMR data. The result of these calculations were then verified against the NMR experimental data by minimization in the Sander module of AMBER8.28 All AMBER calculations were performed on SGI clusters (IMD UH). PROCHECK_NMR29 was used to analyze the quality of the refined structures.

Dimerization of the pactolus I-domain

Residues to which resonance assignments could not be sequentially assigned clustered to three regions in the sequence (Leu180­Ile195, Asn215­Ala220, and Ser245­ Leu261). To investigate whether this is due to dimerization, a 0.4 mM 15N-labeled Pactolus I-domain NMR sample was injected into a Superdex 75 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare), which generated two peaks (supplementary data). Using molecular weight standards, the secondary peak was calculated to be approximately 52 kDa, which corresponds to a homodimeric Pactolus Idomain. Dimerization of the domain would also account for the poor NMR relaxation characteristics of the protein in solution and the intermediate exchange broadening at the dimer interface.

NMR sequence-specific assignments

A primary peak count of the 1H/15N HSQC spectra of the Pactolus I-domain revealed 182 readily resolvable peaks from a 0.4 mM 2H/13C/15N-labeled sample, if the side chain À ÀNH2 resonances were ignored. Most assignments were subsequently obtained from this sample by analysis of triple resonance heteronuclear NMR spectra to give 84% for Ca, 81% for Cb, 84% for CO, and 84% for 15N, and 85% for 13C backbone resonances [Fig. 1(a)]. Additional 1Ha resonances were obtained from analysis of the heteronuclear NOESY spectra from a 1H/15Nlabeled sample.

Pactolus I-domain does not bind divalent cations

To experimentally identify if the Pactolus I-domain binds an Mg2þ cation for its function, we prepared a 1 H/15N- or a 1H/13C/15N-labeled recombinant Pactolus I-domain in deionized chelex water as described.14 Evidence of the Pactolus I-domain binding of divalent cations was monitored by 1H/15N HSQC spectra of the Pactolus I-domain acquired upon titrating increasing amount of Mg2þ [Fig. 1(a)] and Ca2þ (data not shown). Titration using Mg2þ followed by back titration with EDTA showed no evidence of a significant interaction of the divalent metal with the protein in the NMR spectra.

peaks were assigned de novo and then cross-checked against the b3 I-domain X-ray structure and aL I-domain solution structure.9,30 The dNN(i,j) cross-strand and the medium range dNN(i,iþ3) and daN(i,iþ4) NOEs were used to define regions of secondary structure and are illustrated in Figure 3(b,c). The peptide bonds for all proline residues were identified as ``trans'' based on 13Ca and 13Cb chemical shifts. Amide proton/deuterium exchange protection correlates to the hydrogen bonding pattern within a protein.31 For the Pactolus I-domain, there were 47 cross-peaks that exchange protected [Fig. 1(b)], and 35 present overnight. This indicates the presence of a stable protein core, and likely hydrogen bond acceptor partners were identified using the NMR data (Table I). Identified residues that show deuterium exchange protection are consistent with the secondary structure hydrogen bonding pattern, with only the a4 and the C-terminal a6 helices showing decreased protection. Best fit analysis of Pactolus I-domain circular dichroism (CD) spectra to a linear combination of standard dichroic spectra for secondary structure elements32 was used to estimate a structural composition of 37% a-helix and 14% b-sheet (supplementary data). Analysis of the Ca, and to a lesser extent the Cb, chemical shift index (CSI) identified six b-strands and six regions of a-helical structure [Fig. 2(a)]. Only a limited subset of NOEs could be identified due to homodimerization of the Pactolus I-domain. Even so, the NMR data extended the identified regions of secondary structure to uniquely identifying the cross-strand b-sheet pairing and the i­iþ4 hydrogen bonding interactions within the helices (Figs. 3 and 4).

program PROMOTIF33 and show good correlation to the CSI [Fig. 5(b)]. The models also agree well with the cross-strand b-sheet pairing and helical hydrogen bond formation shown in Figure 3. The overall topology of the Pactolus I-domain structure is that of a Rossmann fold, which consists of a central parallel b-sheet composed of five strands and an additional short antiparallel b-sheet, surrounded by seven amphipathic a-helices [Fig. 5(b)]. The topology is similar to that of its integrin b3 I-domain template structure (pdb#1JV2), with the backbone RMSD between the template and the lowest energy ° model I-domain is 1.6 A using the stamp module in VMD.34 However, in the Pactolus structure the SDL is replaced by a short turn formed between residues V172F176.

DISCUSSION The most significant change which differentiates the function of Pactolus from the integrins is the Asp to Gly modification at the MIDAS. NMR and ITC titrations demonstrate that the Pactolus I-domain does not interact with magnesium cations, indicating that, unlike the integrin I-domains, it cannot mediate a metal iondependant carboxyl ligand interaction. The Asp­Asp motif of ADMIDAS and the Asp of LIMBS are also mutated to Gly­His and Asn respectively, further contributing to a loss of metal divalent cation occupancy of the Pactolus I-domain. Coordination of a carboxyl group to a divalent metal at the MIDAS is the hallmark of integrin­ligand interactions. Therefore, these key mutations preclude Pactolus­ligand binding via the same metal iondependent mechanism for integrin­ligand interactions. Though the MIDAS region within Pactolus I-domain may still remain the primary point of interaction with an as yet unidentified and ligand. Alternatively, Pactolus may interact with other proteins or ligands primarily through its saccharide coat. Two insertions, the SDL and insertion 2, structurally distinguish the integrin b I-domain to the a I-domain. The Pactolus I-domain has only one of these two insertions (insertion 2, Leu219­Pro259) located between the b3-strand and the a4 helix9,35,36 (Figs. 6 and 7). In integrins, the insertion 2 region is hydrophobic and essential for the formation of the integrin-headpiece through its dimerization with the b-propeller domain within the a-subunit. Replacing a short region within the integrin b3-subunit (GIVQP), with the more hydrophilic residues found in Pactolus (TRQNT) prevented the association with an a5-subunit.13,30 The Pactolus I-domain is structurally similar to the a-subunit I-domain9,35,36 in that they each lack an SDL, with the loop between b2 and b3 sheets four (pactolus) or three (integrins) residues long and linked by a tight turn (Figs. 6 and 7). In integrins, this SDL region is critical for the specificity of

NMR data was used to experimentally refine the structures generated from modeling with the integrin b3 I-domain from the crystal structure of aVb3 as a template (pdb#1JV2). Structures were obtained using a protocol of initial calculations using DYANA,26 modeling using Modeller8v2, and minimization with the NMR restraints reapplied using AMBER8.28 An AMBER minimization with the NMR restraints reapplied, resulted in only small deviations from the modeled structures (Table II). The 20 structures with the lowest torsion angle energies, restraint violation energies and AMBER energies were selected for analysis, as summarized in Table II and shown in Figure 5(a). The models show excellent agreement with the experimental NMR data, with no viola° tions of distance restraints greater than 0.4 A, and no angle violations greater than 4.68 (Table II). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) for backbone heavyatoms from residues 126­336 for the 20 AMBER mini° mized NMR-enhanced models was 0.8 A. Within the calculated structures, the boundaries of the regions of secondary structure were identified using the

Two of three potential N-linked (Asn­ X­Ser/Thr) glycosylation sites, Asn151 (in the turn between b2 and b20 ) and Asn230 (in the center of insertion 2), are unique to Pactolus and a third site (Asn204) is common among integrin b-subunits.13 Within Pactolus, the unique glycosylation sites are near the recombinant protein homodimerization site [Fig. 6(a)]. These Nlinked glycosylation sites, when superimposed onto the b3 I-domain in aVb3 (pdb#1JV2), lie at the interface of the b I-domain and the b-propeller which form the

Within the literature, it is generally accepted that two proteins with more than 25% sequence homology will correlate not only their structure, but also their function39: However, Pactolus is a fascinating example in which the overall structural and sequence conservation is not correlated with a conservation of function. With a 60% sequence homology to the integrins, Pactolus clearly shows that there may not always be a direct correlation of sequence conservation and protein function. Indeed, all the changes, including ab heterodimerization, MIDASmediated binding, glycosylation, and interaction of the SDL with its ligand, affect the essential determinants of integrin function. Thus in the divergence and evolution of
