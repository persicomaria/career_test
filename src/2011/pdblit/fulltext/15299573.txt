Abstract The three-dimensional structure of the serine protease subtilisin BPN' (SBT) has been refined at 1.6A resolution in space group C2 to a final R value of 0.17. 17 regions of discrete disorder have been identified and analyzed. Two of these are dualconformation peptide units; the remainder invclve alternate rotamers of side chains either alone o~ in small clusters. The structure is compared with previously reported high-resolution models of SBT in two other space groups, P212~2 ~ and P2~. Apart from the surface, there are no significant variations in structure among the three crystal forms. Structural variations observed at the protein surface occur predominantly in regions of protein-protein contact. The crystal packing arrangements in the three space groups are compared.

1. Introduction Members of the subtilase family of serine proteases are expressed in a diverse range of organisms from prokaryotes to humans (Siezen, de Vos, Leunissen & Dijkstra, 1991). The family's founders, subtilisins (E.C. 3.4.21.14), are secreted by several species of bacteria, particularly Bacillis subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens, for the digestion of nutrients in their native soil milieu. Subtilisin BPN' (SBT) is the name given to the enzyme from B. amyloliquefaciens. SBT has 275 residues and a molecular weight of 28 kDa. The same molecule, originally isolated from a different bacterial strain but shown to be identical, is also called subtilisin Novo. Subtilisin Carlsberg is a similar enzyme from B. subtilis with 83 residue differences from SBT. Several decades of scientific work place SBT among the best studied enzymes. Its active site and mechanism share many features with the trypsin family of proteases, although the protein fold is different (Wright, 1972). Substrate specificity has been analyzed and

rationally modified (Estell et al., 1986). Numerous sitespecific mutations that increase thermostability have been described (Pantoliano et al., 1989; Gilliland, Gallagher & Bryan, 1996). The stronger of SBT's two calcium-binding sites binds Ca 2+ with K, = 7 x 10°M -~, and is important in folding and stability (Bryan et al., 1992). The other site is weaker and less specific, consisting of two overlapping subsites for monovalent and divalent cations (Pantoliano et al., 1988). Although the wild-type enzyme refolds poorly in vitro, demonstration of reversible unfolding in an engineered variant has opened the way for folding studies (Strausberg et al., 1993). The enzyme is used both as a laboratory reagent and as a protein-degrading additive in industrial and household detergents. The three-dimensional structure of subtilisin was first reported by Wri~[ht, Alden & Kraut (1969) at a resolution of 2.5A. The crystals belonged to space group C2 and were grown at pH6 with 1.3M ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. Drenth, Hol, Jansonius & Koekoek (!972) then reported the crystal structure of SBT to 2.8 A resolution in a second crystal form, space group P21 , using acetone as the precipitant. The resolution of this crystal form has recently been extended to 1.75.A, (Gilliland et al., 1996). Bott et al. (1988) reported another crystal form for SBT at 1.8.A, resolution, in space group P2~2~2~. These crystals were obtained under conditions similar to the original C2 form, us'.ng ammonium sulfate, but with added CaCI 2. One source of variation in SBT crystal growth is the use of different active-site inhibitors. Crystallization of SBT usually requires some method of inhibiting enzymatic activity to prevent autodigestion. The Wright et al. (1969) structure used phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) while the Drenth et al. (1972) structure used diisopropylfluorophosphate; both of these agents bind covalently to the active-site serine. Bott et al. (1988) also used PMSF in their structure determination. In order to examine and compare the high-resolution structures of SBT in these three different crystal

SUBTILISIN BPN' AT 1.6/~, RESOLUTION Before macroseeding, the target drops were allowed to equilibrate tbr two hours. The transferred crystals would then grow for about a week. For the large crystals used in X-ray data collection, this macroseeding procedure was repeated three times. This method differs from the original C2 crystal conditions of Wright et al. o(1969) mainly in the pH and buffer used. Data to 1.55 A resolution were collected using synchrotron radiation from the EMBL beamline X31 at the DORIS storage ring, DESY, Hamburg, Germany. The synchrotron ring was operating in a single bunch mode at 3.7GeV and a current of 50 to 70mA with approximately five hours between injections. Data were recorded at a wavelength of 1.07A at 4 using the EMBL image-plate scanner at a crystal-to-plate distance of 240mm. The final Rnl~rg~, defined as ~JI-(I)1/~-~I, was 5.0%. The reflections were phased by use of the molecular replacement technique (Fitzgerald, 1988), using as probe the Bott et al. (1988) P2~2~2~ structure. 2.2. Refinement The refinements of all three crystal forms are summarized in Table 1. All refinement was carried out by the restrained-parameter least-squares procedure of PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1981). Refinements of the P2~2~2~ and P2~ structures are described elsewhere. The first part of the C2 refinement utilized the vectorized 'gprlsa' version (Furey, Wang & Sax, 1982), running on a Cray supercomputer. After 15 rounds (about 250 refinement cycles), the crystallographic residual R had fallen from 0.275 to 0.170. A total of 175 water molecules were added to the model during this phase of the refinement. Subsequent rounds of refinement, involving discretely disordered residues with two or more modeled conformations, utilized the version of P R O F F T modified by Finzel (1987) to incorporate the fast Fourier transform algorithms of Ten Eyck (1973), Agarwal (1978) and Sheriff (1987), to restrain contacts between different molecules. The F R O D O (Jones, 1978) program was used on an Evans and Sutherland PS390 graphics system to examine F , , - F,. and 2F,,- F,. difference electron-density maps and omit maps, to adjust the model and to add solvent molecules. Solvent molecules were added to the model at chemically reasonable positions where difference density exceeded 3c~. Water molecules whose omit density fell below 3or or whose 2Fo -F,. density fell below l cr were removed from the model during the course of the refinement, while new water molecules were added as indicated by difference map maxima. The final model contains 194 water molecules which have been ranked by occ2/B (James & Sielecki, 1983). Discrete disorder was treated as follows. Residues whose difference electron density suggested multiple conformations were analyzed using omit maps. These

forms, we sought to extend the resolution of the original C2 structure to match the others. The resulting C2 data resolution in fact surpassed the others and gave the additional bonus of revealing several discretely disordered regions in the SBT molecule.

2.1. Crystallization and structure determination.

Crystals in space group P21 were grown from 55% acetone, pH 9, as described in Bryan et al. (1986). This method is a slight variation on the original P2~ crystal conditions given by Drenth & Hol (1967). Data collection utilized a rotating-anode X-ray source and a Siemens multiwire proportional counter* as described in Gallagher, Bryan & Gilliland (1993). The P2~ crystal form utilized a double mutant of SBT. The Ser ~ Cys mutation at position 221 reduces enzymatic activity by about four orders of magnitude to prevent autolysis (Abrahmsen et al., 1991; Gallagher et al., 1993). The Asn ~ Ser mutation at residue 218 enhances stability and improves crystallization behavior for this crystal form (Bryan et al., 1986). Both mutations have been structurally characterized and found to produce only local changes at the mutation site (Gilliland et al., 1996). The crystallization, structure solution and refinement of the P2~2~2 t crystal form (2STI) are described by Bott et al. (1988). These crystals were grown at pH6 under conditions otherwise similar to those producing the C2 form (see below). Crystals belonging to space group C2 were grown likewise by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, under the following conditions. The protein solution contained 7 . 5 m g m l -~ SBT in 2 0 m M M E S buffer, pH 7.0, with the inhibitor PMSF present at 2 mM. The reservoir contained 35-40% saturated ammonium sulfate, 0.5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1% fl-octylglucoside and 2% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol in 5 0 m M M E S buffer, pH 7.0. Crystals grew from equal mixtures of protein and reservoir solutions within a week. Both the C2 and P2~2t2 t crystal forms often grew in the same drop. Small plate-shaped seed crystals were transferred to new hanging drops for continued growth. The new drops were made by mixing protein solution as above but at pH6.5 and with 5 m M CaCI 2 with reservoir solution consisting of 38-40% saturated ammonium sulfate and 1 mM sodium azide in either 5 0 m M MES at pH6.5 or 50mM MOPS at pH7.0. *Certain commercial equipment, instruments, and materials are identified in this paper in order to specifythe experimental procedure. Such identificationdoes not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

maps enabled initial modeling of the conformers and provided the basis for a starting estimate of the partial occupancies. Using the alternate-chains feature of PROLSQ, the coordinates and temperature parameters of the individual conformers were refined, and difference and omit maps were used to evaluate the correctness of the occupancies. After 5-10 iterations, coordinates converged and difference electron density diminished to background levels. As the refinement progressed, additional discretely disordered residues were detected. The final model contains 18 alternate conformers of 15 side chains, and two alternate conformers of the main chain, for a total of 80 atoms with alternate positions modeled. 2.3. Structure comparison Pairwise superpositions of the models were performed using all 275 Cot atoms as guides (Satow, Cohen, Padlan & Davies, 1986), and distances between equivalent atoms were calculated. Significant structural variations were identified using the method of Bott & Frane (1990). The basis of this method is a linear fit between the logarithm of the atoms' positional deviations and their mean B factors; thus equivalent structural variations are more significant when B factors are low. For each atom, the excess deviation over that expected for its mean B factor is normalized to give a 'Z score'. Residue Z scores are calculated as the sum of atomic Z scores divided by the square root of the number of atoms in the residues. Residue Z scores over 3.0 represent residues with significantly different positions between the models. This method provides

an unbiased assessment of structural between identical or similar proteins. 3. Results

differences

3.1. The 1.6,7t structure
With the highest resolution reported for any subtilisin BPN' structure, this model has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977).* Effects of the active-site inhibitor, the 17 regions of discrete disorder, and crystal packing provide the only important deviations from previous descriptions of SBT. The high-affinity Ca 2+ site (Site A) is as previously described (Gallagher et al., 1993), while the weaker and less specific B site is occupied by a cation in the monovalent subsite (Pantoliano et al., 1988). This cation appears to be an ammonium ion with full occupancy (based on the crystal growth conditions and the previously described promiscuity of the site); the site has octahedral coordination with five protein oxygen ligands (the carbonyl groups of 169, 171, 174, 195 and a carboxyl O atom of Asp197) and a water ligand (coordination lengths from 2.8 to 3.1 A). Table 2 lists the 15 discretely disordered side chains, which in most cases involve variation of the Z~ torsion angle among the usual staggered conformations (Bhat, Sasisekharan & Vijayan, 1979; Ponder & Richards,

SUBTILISIN BPN' AT 1.6~, RESOLUTION Table 2. Side chains with multiple conformations in C2

1987). 40% of the disordered side chains belong to serine residues on or near the molecular surface. In the active site, discrete disorder is observed for residue His64 and the neighboring Ser63 (see Fig. 1). Here the alternate conformations of the histidine correlate with the partial occupancy (0.7) of the inhibitor. This 'static' disorder represents a superposition of molecules in the crystal, some of which have the inhibitor while some do not. Previous SBT structures have shown that PMS c a n cause the His64 side chain to be displaced (Wright et al., 1969). Fig. 1 also shows that residue Ser63 is discretely disordered among the three possible rotamers; the occupancies are 0.7, 0.15 and 0.15. The main conformation, with ~(~ = 7 6 , is stabilized by a short hydrogen bond (2.5A) to the hydroxyl group of Tyr217; the other conformations have no hydrogen bonding. The threefold disorder cannot be attributed simply to presence/absence of the inhibitor and reflects some dynamic mobility in this side chain. The two conformations of residue Met222, like His64, are also correlated with the partial occupancy of the inhibitor. A few other dual-conformation residues near the active site, including Gin59, Thr71 ' and Lys94, probably represent static disorder. The three instances of tripleconformation residues, and several dual-conformation residues far from the active site, probably represent single-molecule dynamic disorder. Two of the discretely disordered regions are dualconformation peptides (residues 97-98 and 257-258" see Table 3 and Figs. 2 and 3). In both of these cases, the lesser occupied conformer is energetically less favorable, both according to standard Ramachandran.

analysis (Ramachandran, Ramakrishnan & Sasisekharan, 1963) and with regard to hydrogen bonding. In the case of the peptide 97-98 where the residues are in a loop that belongs to the enzyme's substrate-binding region, the effect is probably a result of the partial occupancy of the inhibitor. In the main conformation, there is a 2.9 ~, hydrogen bond between 97 O and 100 N, stabilizing this exterior loop in a tight turn. The other disordered peptide, 257-258, is also on the molecular surface and the main conformation has two hydrogen bonds to water molecules, while the minor conformation has none. Interestingly, this peptide was observed to rotate about 90 when the enzyme was inactivated by peroxide (Bott et al., 1988).

The P2~ structure (1SUB) features the active-site mutation Ser --~ Cys at residue 221. This cysteine is found oxidized to the sulfone as in Abrahmsen et al. (1991). A second mutation previously shown to increase the enzyme's thermostability and to improve crystal quality, Asn-218-Ser, is also in the active-site region (Bryan et al., 1986). This residue is 3.8 A from Ser145 of a symmetry-related molecule. The weak cationbinding B site is occupied by a sodium ion in the monovalent subsite in this structure, which also includes one molecule of acetone, stacking against the side chain of Phe58. Pairwise r.m.s, deviations among the three superimposed models are given in Table 4. The mean coordinate error for the C2 structure has been estimated at 0 . 1 5 A based on Luzzati analysis (Luzzati, 1952), and between 0.15 and 0 . 2 0 A for the other two structures. Deviation of Ca positions is close to that expected for identical structures with observational coordinate errors in this range. The method of Bott & Frane (1990), which takes into account the temperature factors of compared structures, was applied to determine which residues differ significantly among the three crystal forms (see Materials and methods). The foundation of this analysis is a linear regression that gives a best-fit line to the distribution of log deviations versus mean B factors [Fig. 4(a)]. The y intercept of this line gives the value of the log of the deviation expected for atoms with B = 0,~2. For the C2 versus P21212 ~ comparison, the intercept and slope are - 2 . 5 1 and 0.09. For the C2 versus P2~ comparison, the intercept and slope are - 2 . 6 3 and 0.10. The corresponding values for the P2~2~2~ versus P2~ comparison are - 2 . 2 7 and 0.10. Residue Z scores derived from the analysis report the degree of deviation of each residue [see Fig. 4(b)]. In each of the three pairwise comparisons, the highest residue Z scores correspond to residues whose X~ rotamer is altered by contact with another protein in the crystal. Leading the list are Tyr6 and Ser37, whose residue Z scores in the C2 versus P2~2~2~ comparison are 8.4 and 7.7, respectively. Tyr6 provides a dramatic example of crystallization-induced conformational change. In both C2 and P2~ this side chain occupies an inward-pointing rotamer, but in space group P2~2~2 t it is displaced to an outward rotamer by a crystal contact (Fig. 5). In an interesting correlation involving protein stability, this alternate rotamer for Tyr6 was also observed in a mutant SBT lacking the calcium A site (Gallagher et al., 1993). Determined in the P2~ crystal form (where the crystal contact is absent), this calcium-free version of SBT had

In part (a) the logarithm of the distance between equivalent atoms is plotted against their mean temperature factors for all atoms comparing the C2 with the P21212 t crystal form. The linear fit to this distribution (mean value of distance as a function of temperature factor) is plotted as a solid line. The dashed line shows three time the r.m.s, error added to the mean value, corresponding to an atomic Z score of 3. In part (b) residue Z scores are plotted versus residue number for both the C2 versus P212121 and the C2 versus P2~ comparisons.

GALLAGHER, OLIVER, BOTT, BETZEL AND GILLILAND Met222 as noted above (see Fig. 1). Although the final occupancy lot PMS is 0.7, it is well ordered, with the S atom close to the Cot position of the PI substratebinding site (McPhalen & James, 1988). The PMS phenyl ring points toward the PI' binding site but is short and wide, resulting in the steric displacement of His64 as described above. The inhibitor displaces the two water molecules that are nearest to Ser221 in the P2~2~21 structure, one of which coincides with the position of the carbonyl O atom of the scissile bond and is hydrogen bonded to the side-chain N atom of Asn 155. Two other water molecules, near the positions of the P2 and P3 site carbonyl O atoms, are also absent in the C2 structure though present in the other two. In these cases the cause of the displacement must be more subtle since the PMS does not sterically intrude on these sites. In space group P2~ the two mutations, both in the activesite region, have only local effects on the protein structure. The positions of the two sulfonyl O atoms bound to Cys221 correspond closely with the two water sites in the naked active site of the P2~212 ~ structure mentioned above, and one of them is hydrogen bonded to the side-chain N atom of Asn155. 3.3. Conserved water Water molecules were grouped according to the distance to the nearest water site in the other crystal forms, and the mean B factor in each group computed. This analysis is similar to that performed by Bott et al. (1988) when they compared the P212~2 ~ form with the older models of the other two forms. The distribution shows a group of water molecules with low B factors and close positional alignment. The histogram then has a minimum near 1A; there are few water molecules with this inter-water distance. Then the function increases again and the B factors are higher.° The group of water molecules that align to within 1.0 A are

1131

considered to represent conserved water sites, and their low B factors are consistent with their being firmly bound. This analysis identified 72 water sites that are conserved to within 1 it among the three models. About a third of these are completely buried within the protein, while another third are bound in deep surface cavities with little solvent access. If the distance criterion is reduced to 0.5,~, 45 water molecules are included. These 45 tightly conserved water sites include numerous buried water molecules that have been described previously (McPhalen & James, 1988; Bott et al., 1988). Most of the conserved waters are partially exposed on the protein surface, and some of these are used to form bridging waters in crystal contacts. A more detailed comparison of hydration in the three models is in preparation.
3.4. Co'stal packing

The three crystals forms pack with similar solvent fractions (see Table 1). Among the three there are no identical crystal contacts, though the P212~2 ~ and P2~ forms have two pairs of similar contacts as described below. Crystal contacts have been analyzed using a 4,~, distance cutoff. In space group C2, SBT packs with 11 contacting neighbors. Three of these are twofold related while the other eight comprise four pairs of relations involving translation, two with the centering operation and two with the screw axis. Table 5 gives information on the symmetry and components of each contact. In these Tables, contacts are ranked by the total number of contact atoms, beginning with the strongest contact. The P212121 form packs with ten neighbors (see Table 6). In the P21 crystal form, each protein has eight contacting neighbors (see Table 7). In both the P2~2~21 and P21 crystal forms there is a contact that places the C-terminal end of the protein's central helix (residues 220-238) near the N-terminal

ends of the two parallel surface helices (residues 103117 and 132-145). In both cases the contact relates molecules along a screw axis: contact 5 in P2~2t2 ~ along the c direction and contact 2 in P2~ along the b direction. Although the angular relation of the contacting molecules differs, the unit-cell dimension produced by the screw translation is similar in both cases (75.2 versus 79.5A). A sulfate ion mediates the contact in P212121, with hydrogen bonds to helix-terminal residues in both contacting proteins. This common contact, which is illustrated in Fig. 6, suggests that helix dipoles have' a role in forming crystal contacts. However, in the C2 crystals there is not only no similar contact, but contact 5 involves residues from the C-terminal ends of the three relevant helices, an unfavourable dipole arrangement.

Another contact is similar between the P212~2 ~ and P21 crystals: contact 2 in the former and contact 3 in the latter. Both of these contacts relate molecules with identical orientation, so that the vector from one contact surface to the other, through a single molecule, determines a lattice translation. Thus, lattice constant a in P2~2~2~ and lattice constant c in P2~ both correspond to the approximate diameter of the protein. The residues involved are similar but not identical in the two crystal forms. Fig. 7 illustrates this similar contact in the two crystal forms.

SUBTILISIN BPN' AT 1.6,~ RESOLUTION Although two of the crystal forms in the present analysis are grown from high salt while the third is from acetone, there is no clear distinction between the character of the resulting crystal contacts. A similar comparison of salt-grown versus alcohol-grown crystals of ribonuclease A found that salt-grown crystals had more extensive van der Waals interactions and fewer polar contacts than alcohol-grown crystals (Svensson et al., 1991). This tendency is observed here for SBT, but it is not dramatic. Taken together the results of all the packing comparisons, including the bridging water and hydrogen-bond analysis, do not reveal any distinct rule regarding the effects on packing in high versus low ionic strength crystals. The two salt-grown crystals in the present study, though produced under nearly identical conditions, appear as different in molecular detail as either of them are from the acetone-grown higher pH form. In fact, the similarities in packing described in the previous paragraph make the P212121 and P2~ forms more similar than the two salt-grown forms. Although the acetone-grown crystals have the lowest number of contacts, in other respects such as the total number of contact atoms, hydrogen bonds or bridging water molecules, the acetone values are intermediate between tl,ose of the two ammonium sulfate systems. This suggests that the fundamental processes occurring in crystal formation are not profoundly affected by the ionic strength.

because of crystal-packing effects. The structures were compared using the method of Bott & Franc (1990). The chief advantage of this method over simple coordinate comparison is that, by taking B factors into account, it identifies small but significant perturbations in wellordered regions while ignoring insignificant variations in relatively disordered residues, e.g. surface lysines. In the context of subtilisin, where numerous engineered mutants and inhibitor complexes are under study, it is a useful and unbiased tool for highlighting important structural effects. The method produces a Z score for each atom (and for each residue), such that a Z score over 3.0 reflects a significant structural change. Each pairwise comparison produces about ten residues with Z greater than 3.0. The largest differences occur at crystal contacts where side chains, and in some cases the backbone, are displaced by crystal-packing forces. All the residues with residue Z scores of 4 and above belong to crystal contacts in at least one of the crystal forms in each comparison except His64, whose structural variation is due to the inhibitor in space group C2. The largest Z score (8.4) belongs to Tyr6, which adopts a different rotamer because of the crystal packing in the P212~2 ~ crystals (Fig. 5). Tables 5, 6 and 7 facilitate comparison of the crystal contacts among the three systems. Each crystal employs a set of unique contacts. How the chemical conditions cause a particular set of contacts to form, thus determining the crystal packing, lattice geometry and space-group symmetry, is a dynamic problem, for which the present analysis can supply only static information. This problem is analogous to the protein-folding problem in that the initial and final states are known, but the intermediate states are elusive and key to understanding the transition. Extensive hydration of three protein surfaces, and the predominance of hydrogen bonding (including bridging water molecules) in the major crystal contacts, together suggest that the hydration structure may play an important role in selecting the contacts. According to this view, variations in the occupancies of surface-bound water molecules, which could be sensitive to the protein's chemical environment, could in turn alter the relative strengths of transient contacts. When the hydration pattern promotes a favorable set of transient contacts, supersaturating conditions could lead to condensation of crystal nuclei. One role of a successful crystallization agent would then be to promote desolvation of nascent contacts, so that inter-protein hydrogen bonds can form. An alternative role for hydration in contact selection, which would apply to hydrophobic contacts as well as those involving hydrogen bonds, requires compatibility between the water structures around the nascent contacts. Specifically, compatible water structures adjacent to a contact are expected to strengthen that contact.
