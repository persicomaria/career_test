Pseudouridine (5-b-D -ribofuranosyluracil, C) is the most commonly found modified base in RNA. Conversion of uridine to C is performed enzymatically in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes by pseudouridine synthases (EC 4.2.1.70). The Escherichia coli C-synthase RluD modifies uridine to C at positions 1911, 1915 and 1917 within 23 S rRNA. RluD also possesses a second function related to proper assembly of the 50 S ribosomal subunit that is independent of C-synthesis. Here, we report the crystal structure of the catalytic module of RluD (residues 68­ 326; ° DRluD) refined at 1.8 A to a final R-factor of 21.8% ðRfree ¼ 24:3%Þ: DRluD is a monomeric enzyme having an overall mixed a/b fold. The DRluD molecule consists of two subdomains, a catalytic subdomain and C-terminal subdomain with the RNA-binding cleft formed by loops extending from the catalytic sub-domain. The catalytic sub-domain of DRluD has a similar fold as in TruA, TruB and RsuA, with the location of the RNA-binding cleft, active-site and conserved, catalytic Asp residue superposing in all four structures. Superposition of the crystal structure of TruB bound to a T-stem loop with RluD reveals that similar RNA ­ protein interactions for the flipped-out uridine base would exist in both structures, implying that base-flipping is necessary for catalysis. This observation also implies that the specificity determinants for site-specific RNA-binding and recognition likely reside in parts of RluD beyond the active site.

Introduction
Of all post-transcriptional modifications made to RNA, none is more common than conversion of uridine to pseudouridine (5-b-D -ribofuranosyluracil, C).1,2 Analysis of C composition from a variety of ribosomal RNAs shows that as much as

8% of all uridine bases are converted to C.3 In Escherichia coli, a total of ten C are found, one in 16 S rRNA4 and nine in 23 S rRNA.3 Of those in 23 S rRNA, three C, at positions 1911, 1915 and 1917 (E. coli numbering) are found to be within a loop, with the latter two C found at conserved positions in 23 S rRNA from all species characterized.3 Position 1915 is of particular interest in 23 S rRNA, as it contains the unique nucleoside 3-methylpseudouridine (m3C).5 This loop, corresponding to the end of helix 69 in the crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus 70 S ribosome is near the ribosome peptidyl-transferase center and at the interface between the 50 S and 30 S ribosomal subunits.6 While the precise function for C at these positions remains unclear, biophysical

Crystal Structure of E. coli RluD

studies on short RNA hairpins of this loop region of E. coli 23 S rRNA suggest that C at position 1911 is stabilizing, while C at either positions 1915 or 1917 is slightly destabilizing.7 Conversion of uridine to C is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthases (EC 4.2.1.70). In eubacteria, four families of these enzymes have been identified based on sequence comparisons, and are designated TruA, TruB RluA and RsuA.8,9 Recently, a fifth enzyme, designated TruD, that is responsible for conversion of U15 to C in tRNAGlu has been discovered.10 The sequence of this enzyme bears no resemblance to that of any previously identified C-synthase and, unlike the previously identified C-synthase families, it is broadly distributed in eukarya, archaea and bacteria. A total of 11 pseudouridine synthases have now been identified in E. coli, and together are responsible for all C formation in E. coli rRNA and tRNA.10,11 One of these, RluD (formerly SfhB or YfiL), a member of the RluA family, has been shown to specifically modify uridine to C at positions 1911, 1915 and 1917 of E. coli 23 S rRNA both in vitro and in vivo.12,13 Purification of E. coli RluD revealed an enzyme with an apparent mass of 44 kDa (37 kDa based on the derived amino acid sequence) whose in vitro specificity was found to correlate with the concentration of Mg2þ (Wrzesinski et al.14). Deletion of the rluD gene results in severe growth inhibition in E. coli, decreasing the exponential growth rate two- to threefold.12,13 Interestingly, mutation of Asp139, the catalytic residue, to either Asn or Thr abolishes formation of C in vivo as demonstrated by expression of the mutant RluD in trans in an rluD 2 background, but does not inhibit growth.15 Analysis of ribosome profiles by sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed defective assembly of the 50 S subunit in the rluD 2 strain.16 Normal ribosome profiles compared to wild-type cells can be re-established by expressing the Asp139Asn or Asp139Thr mutant RluD protein in trans in the rluD 2 background. These results suggest that RluD possesses an additional function in addition to that of pseudouridine formation, possibly acting as an RNA chaperone or accessory factor to ribosome assembly, in vivo.16 Recently, crystal structures have been obtained for representatives of three of the five eubacterial C-synthase families: TruA,17 TruB18 and RsuA.19 Of these, only the structure of TruB has been determined with bound RNA, a T-stem loop minihelix.20 This combination of structural information, together with biochemical studies on the mechanism of C-synthases21,22 has yielded a wealth of insight into these enzymes. Strikingly, despite the lack of overall sequence similarity, the structures of the C-synthases bear remarkable similarity to one another, with this similarity extending to the locations of their active sites and position of the catalytic Asp residue. Despite this knowledge, many questions remain regarding the exact nature of the catalytic mechanism, as well as how these

enzymes precisely recognize their substrate(s).23 As no structural representative has been obtained for the RluA family, and RluD specifically possesses an additional function related to cell growth, we undertook structure determination of this enzyme. Here, we report the crystal structure of ° E. coli RluD(D1 ­ 67) refined at 1.8 A resolution and its comparison with the structures of other C synthases.

Results and Discussion
Identification of RluD (68 ­ 326) Hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion crystallization trials on full-length RluD using PEG8000 as precipitant yielded two crystal forms that were either layered or that diffracted only to low resolution. Limited proteolysis screening with a series of endoproteinases generated a , 30 kDa fragment with enhanced resistance to proteolysis. N-terminal sequencing of this fragment following digestion of RluD with elastase yielded the sequence Asn-Ala-Glu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Glu, corresponding to cleavage at residue 68 of full-length RluD. Comparison of this cleavage site with a multiple sequence alignment for related enzymes using the ProDom24 server indicated that the proteinases cleaved RluD within a linker region between an S4-like domain and the main body of the protein. This domain arrangement for some members of the RsuA and RluA families of C-synthases was previously noted based on sequence comparisons.25 A similar domain organization was observed based on the crystal structure of E. coli RsuA.19 The crystal structures of native RsuA from two different crystal forms revealed flexibility between the S4-like domain and the rest of the protein. We hypothesized that removal of the S4-like domain would reduce the conformational flexibility within the RluD molecule and yield crystals with better diffraction ° characteristics. Crystals diffracting to 1.8 A resolution were readily obtained from RluD (D1 ­67, hereinafter called DRluD) following purification of the protein as a non-cleavable, N-terminal His-tagged construct. Overall structure The structure of DRluD from E. coli was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method from synchrotron data using SeMet-labeled protein and was refined to a final ° R-factor of 0.218 ðRfree ¼ 0:243Þ at 1.8A resolution. An example of the electron density from a simulated annealing omit map in the active-site region is presented in Figure 1. The asymmetric unit

contains one DRluD molecule comprising 251 residues from Ala75 to Leu326 and a total of 294 water molecules. Neither the His-tag nor the residues 68 ­ 74, part of the flexible linker, had interpretable density and were not modeled. The organization of DRluD molecules in the crystal is consistent with it being a monomer, the same as the E. coli pseudouridine synthases RsuA and TruB, but different from TruA, which is a dimer.17 Analysis of the Ramachandran plot using the program PROCHECK26 showed that 89.7% of all residues are within the most favored regions and the remaining 10.3% in additional allowed regions. We define full-length RluD as consisting of an N-terminal, S4-like domain (, 65 residues) joined by a flexible linker to a catalytic module (DRluD). The DRluD molecule adopts a mixed a/b fold ° ° ° with overall dimensions of , 27 A £ 38 A £ 63 A. This structure can be divided into a catalytic subdomain (residues 75 ­254, and 277­ 300) and C-terminal subdomain (residues 255 ­276 and 301­ 326) (Figure 2). A total of nine b-strands and five a-helices are found per molecule. The nine b-strands assemble into a single twisted b-sheet, which runs the length of the molecule. The strand order is b1,b2,b3,b9,b4,b7,b6,b5, and with the exception of strands b4 and b9, the strands are anti-parallel. Strand b8 hydrogen bonds to b9 and forms the rear wall of the activesite cleft. Loops extending from the b-sheet form a cleft near the middle of the catalytic domain which serves as the site of rRNA binding. Helices a1 and a2 sandwich the twisted b-sheet at one end, while at the opposite end the b-sheet is capped by a 2-turn a-helix, a3 (Figure 2). The C-terminal subdomain consists of the helical pair a4 and a5, the extended polypeptide segment from residue 256 ­261, and the final C-terminal residues 321 ­326. This last segment is fully

extended and is perpendicular to helix a5. This region is connected to the main body of the protein through three polypeptide segments (Figure 2). Comparison with other C-synthases Overall structural and sequence similarities A search for structurally similar proteins was performed using the program DALI.27 The only structures showing overall structural similarity were the three other pseudouridine synthase structures, RsuA, TruB and TruA (Figure 3). The most structurally common feature of these proteins is the extensive b-sheet, varying from seven strands (TruB) to nine strands (RluD) that spans the length of the catalytic subdomain. This similarity extends to the location of the active-site clefts, which are found in a similar location when the four structures are superposed (Figure 3). Despite the superposition of these b-sheets, the connecting elements between b-strands within the b-sheet are different for each of the four C-synthases (Figures 3 and 4).
 http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/dali/

Both RluD and RsuA possess a b-strand, b9 and b13, respectively, within the sheet that acts as a "bridge" by being part of the hydrogen bonding network of the sheet and at the same time forming H-bonds to an additional b-strand that forms the base of the active-site cleft. This arrangement is not observed in the tRNA-specific C-synthases TruA and TruB. Though the catalytic module of RluD is most structurally similar to RsuA, both TruB and TruA have a catalytic module of similar length to RluD (, 270 residues). None of the other C-synthases, however, possesses an equivalent of the DRluD C-terminal subdomain. In TruA, a loop between b-strands of the central b-sheet occupies a similar position as helix a4 of DRluD. From a purely functional point of view, RsuA and RluD are more related in as much as they both act on rRNA, whereas, TruB and TruA function with tRNA as the substrate. RluD from E. coli belongs to the RluA family of C-synthases, a conserved family of enzymes.9 The five families of C-synthases (RsuA, RluA, TruB, TruA, TruD) do not possess significant overall sequence similarity between them.9,10 Among three of the five families of bacterial C-synthases,

namely TruB, RluA and RsuA, sequence conservation exits only for two (in TruB) or three (in RluA and RsuA) semi-conserved sequence motifs which have been classified as motif I (93 ­ 104), motif II (135 ­ 148) and motif III (224 ­ 246) (RluD numbering8,9) (Figure 5(a) and (b)). In addition to bacterial C-synthases, these motifs are found to be conserved in a variety of RluD-like sequences from eukaryotes (Figure 5(b)). Motif I contains adjacent, conserved Lys and Pro residues, which, based on mutagenesis studies28 do not have an obvious catalytic role but may function in structural stability of these enzymes. In RluD, the Lys98NZ atom forms a pair of H-bond interactions, with the main-chain O atoms of Leu102 and Pro99. Hydrogen bonds are also formed between the equivalent Lys residue and mainchain carbonyl groups in both the TruB and RsuA structures. The essential, catalytic aspartic acid residue, Asp139 in RluD, is located in motif II and is the only strictly conserved residue in all five C-synthase families. Two adjacent residues, equivalent to Arg137 and Leu138 of RluD, are found in most sequences (Figure 5(a) and (b)). Within motif III, residues equivalent to Gly231, His234, Gln235, Arg237, and to a lesser extent
 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/

His239 and Pro246, are conserved. In both RluD and in the TruB ­ TSL complex, the Arg237 sidechain is observed to form a hydrogen bonding interaction with the catalytic AspOD atom, possibly orienting it for catalysis. In RsuA and TruA, the equivalent residues, Lys187 and Arg205, respectively, do not make a hydrogen bond with the catalytic Asp residue. Mapping of residues from the three sequence motifs onto the molecular surface of RluD (Figure 5(c) and (d)) reveals that they cluster mainly in a ring that encircles the molecule near its center, including the RNA-binding cleft, and may together define the RNA-recognition surface of RluD. Domains N and C-terminal to the catalytic module Many C-synthases have a modular organization, as was evident from the presence of an S4-like domain in some members of the RsuA and RluA families based on sequence comparisons.25 Structural comparison of the four C-synthases shows that TruB, RsuA and RluD all possess domain(s) in addition to the catalytic module. Only TruA, a dimeric enzyme, does not possess any additional domain. In TruB, this additional domain was not predicted based on sequence comparisons, and is C-terminal to the catalytic domain, while in RsuA

and RluD it is N-terminal. The function of the C-terminal domain in TruB is to participate in tRNA binding.18,20 Although the N-terminal S4-like domain has been deleted from DRluD, superposition with RsuA shows that it would make a different connection to the catalytic module in the two proteins. This is most clearly evident from topological comparison of the two C-synthases (Figure 4(a)). In RsuA, the second b-strand of the central b-sheet extends beyond the protein to form a linker with the S4-like domain.19 In RluD, this connection originates from a segment of polypeptide that

leads to the first b-strand of the central b-sheet (Figure 4(a)). With both RluD and RsuA and protein members of their respective families, it would be expected that the small S4-like domain functions to target the C-synthase to its required location so that the catalytic module is positioned appropriately to effect catalysis.19,25 RNA binding and recognition Pseudouridine synthases show remarkably high in vivo specificity for the target uridine bases that they modify.11 Understanding the origins of this

specificity at the molecular level remains one of the central, unsolved problems for this group of enzymes. The structural context of C within 16 S and 23 S rRNAs as well as tRNA shows considerable variation, indicating that these enzymes must be able to recognize and bind to a variety of RNA structures.2,16,29 It is reasonable to presume that at least some of this specificity is related to the shape and size of the specific RNA-binding cleft found in each enzyme. ° ° A cleft , 12 A wide and , 20 A deep is formed at the middle of the catalytic domain of DRluD (Figure 6(a)). The dimensions of this cleft appear

suitable for binding an RNA stem ­ loop, the predicted secondary structure of the "1920-loop" region of 23 S rRNA.13 A depression suitable to accommodate the flipped out bases of RNA is found at the bottom of this cleft (Figure 6(b)). The highly conserved active-site residue Asp139, essential for catalysis, is found within this depression and indicates the location of rRNA binding. In addition to Asp139, the substrate-binding cleft contains several other structurally conserved residues. These include Leu138, Asp141, Thr143, Tyr171, His234, Ile236, Arg237 and Leu279. The greater basic character of the cleft region compared to the

96

Crystal Structure of E. coli RluD

rest of the molecular surface, as calculated using the program GRASP30 further validates this region as the site of rRNA recognition (Figure 6). Basic residues lining the cleft include Lys98, Arg100, His105, Arg131, His136, Arg137, Lys140, Arg164, Arg165, Arg169 and Arg227. While the clefts of DRluD, RsuA, TruA and TruB are found at similar locations in the structures, they at the same time show some important differences. The clefts within DRluD and TruB appear deeper, owing to the longer loops extending from the b-sheet face, than are found in TruA and RsuA. For DRluD and TruB, this deeper cleft is consistent with the specific site of C-formation, at or near the loop portion of an RNA stem-loop. TruA, which modifies uridine bases within the anticodon stem of tRNA31 and RsuA, which acts at U516 located at the base of the "530 loop" in 16 S rRNA4 recognize a different RNA structure than the former enzymes. There is no structural equivalent in RsuA, RluD or TruA of the "thumb" region (portions of strands b8, b9 and helix a4) that is found to pinch the RNA major groove loop in TruB.18 An extended segment of polypeptide extending from two b-strands is found in a similar location, and forms one wall of the cleft. In RluD, an insertion between b2 and a1 consisting of residues 105­ 114 not found in TruB forms the opposite wall of the cleft. Active-site residues Both sequence analysis9,10,21 and mutagenesis studies10,11,21,32,33 have identified a single, conserved aspartic acid residue essential for activity both in vitro and in vivo in all five families of C-synthases. The position of the Asp residue relative to the substrate uridine is fully consistent with the proposed nucleophilic role of the Asp.18 In RluD, this residue corresponds to Asp139.15 Superposition of the four C-synthase structures clearly reveals the same position of this active-site Asp (Asp48 of RluD, Asp102 of RsuA, Asp60 of TruA) that superposes well and adopts a similar side-chain orientation (Figure 7(a)). Rotation of the x1 angle of RsuA Asp102 by , 808 brings the side-chain into the same orientation as that from the other three C-synthases. Superposing RluD and RsuA-UMP shows that the side-chain of Asp139 of RluD would be in a suitable position to effect nucleophilic attack at UMP. In the superposed model the side-chain ° Asp139 is 3.1 A away from the C6 of uridine for ° the Michael addition reaction22 or , 4.2 A away from the C10 of the ribose, in the case of a glycosidase-like mechanism.21 A small rotation about x1 of Asp139 would bring the carboxylate group into close proximity of C10 or C6 sufficient for nucleophillic attack. Based on the RluD ­TruB superposition, the flipped-out bases of the TSL RNA can be readily accommodated in the RluD active site with very few steric clashes. Only the position

of the Arg131 main-chain requires adjustment to accommodate this part of the RNA. This comparison suggests that base flipping would be necessary for isomerization of U to C at positions 1911, 1915 and 1917 in 23 S rRNA. In addition to the catalytic Asp residue, three other residues are structurally conserved among the four enzymes (Figure 5(a)). The residue Tyr171 of RluD is structurally equivalent to Tyr76 of TruB, which, based on modeling, makes a stacking interaction with U55 of the TSL precursor.18 This implies that this side-chain may play a similar function in each of the C-synthases. A leucine residue, Leu200 in TruB, stacks against one face of the flipped-out U55 (Figure 6(a)). Finally, Gly144 of RluD (Gly65 (TruB), Gly107 (RsuA) and Gly53 (TruA)), a residue close to the active-site Asp but is not close to the expected site of RNA binding and appears to be conserved for structural reasons. As well, Lys74 of TruB, which forms a salt-bridge with the phosphate backbone of the flipped-out base U55, is structurally equivalent to Arg169 (RluD), Lys130 (RsuA) and Arg116 (TruA). Arg141, the side-chain of which is found to stack against the g57R flipped-out base in the TruB ­TSL complex, is structurally equivalent to Arg196 of RluD. This structural equivalence is not found in either the RsuA or TruA structures. It is noteworthy that residues identical with Tyr171 and Gly144, but not Leu200, are found at conserved positions in a variety of C-synthases, including several putative enzymes from higher eukaryotes (Figure 5(b)). Other examples exist of conserved active-site residues that are proximal in the structure-based sequence alignment (Figure 7(a)) and may have similar functions in different C-synthases as those proposed for in TruB.18 These include Tyr179 of TruB, equivalent to His233 (RluD), His184 (RsuA])and His202 (TruA). In TruB, the p-electron orbitals of Tyr179 stack against the ribose of residue 55 of TSL RNA. This residue has been proposed to help stabilize the positive charge on the oxocarbenium ribose intermediate.18 As the histidinyl residues in other C-synthases are unlikely to form a favorable stacking interaction with a cation, the specific function of this residue remains an open question. Possible role of the C-terminal subdomain The C-terminal subdomain is a region unique to the structure of RluD (Figure 3). This segment of polypeptide is surface-exposed, especially the pair of helices a4 and a5. A number of charged, both basic and acidic, residues are found at the surface. These include Arg258, Lys261, Glu265, Arg272, Lys273, Glu310, Arg313, Glu317, His319, Lys320 and Glu322. Structural comparison of this subdomain with representative protein structures using DALI revealed a set of polypeptide segments, mainly consisting of a-helical hairpins that

are structurally similar to the helical pair found in RluD. The uniqueness of the C-terminal subdomain to RluD raises the question of whether this segment of polypeptide could play some role in its second function related to cell growth.13,15,16 It is noteworthy that the defective RluD protein expressed

in the E. coli rluD 2 strain resulting from miniTn10(cam) insertion consists of the first 197 residues of RluD fused to an additional 11 residue segment out-of-frame.13 This result localizes the region of the protein responsible for the growth defect to the catalytic module of RluD. The growth defect observed in rluD 2 strains has been

specifically linked to incorrect assembly of the 50 S ribosomal subunit,16 and it has been suggested that this may be the result of RluD acting as an RNA-chaperone.15,16 A similar hypothesis has been put forward for the tRNA-modifying enzyme m5U54-methyltransferase of E. coli, whose gene product is essential for cell growth, independent of its methyltransferase activity.34 While specific proteins with RNA chaperone activity have not yet been identified in vivo, several candidate proteins with this function have been identified in vitro.35 In principle, an RNA chaperone activity exhibited by RluD could be mediated through the cleft region, as several C-synthases in which the catalytic Asp residue has been mutated still retain their ability to bind RNA, although C-synthase activity is abolished.21,33 Alternatively, incorrect assembly of the 50 S subunit could result from the lack of specific protein­ protein interactions normally mediated by RluD that are independent of C-synthase activity. Further evidence for such a function could be obtained in future studies by preparation of a C-terminal truncation of RluD in which helix a5 would be deleted, and evaluation of cell growth when this construct is expressed in an rluD 2 background.

(Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Canada) was dissolved. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice for a total of five, 30 second cycles with 45 seconds between each cycle for cooling. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (100,000g, 4 8C, 30 minutes) and the protein supernatant applied to an equilibrated column (2 ml bed volume) of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham-Pharmacia) and the eluted proteins loaded onto a 2.5 ml bed volume of Ni-NTA (Qiagen). The column was washed first with high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0), 1 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100), then with low-salt buffer (50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8), 400 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 30 mM imidazole). Bound proteins eluted with buffer (50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8), 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 200 mM imidazole). The overall yield of purified protein from a one liter culture was approximately 45 mg. Purified DRluD ran as a single band on both SDS-PAGE and native PAGE. The purified protein was concentrated to 14 mg ml21 and the buffer changed to (20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8), 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT and 5% glycerol) by ultrafiltration using a Centricon-10 concentrator (Millipore) and stored at 4 8C. Crystallization and data collection Crystals of SeMet-labeled DRluD were obtained under oil by the microbatch method.38 Initial crystallization conditions were identified from the Jena Bioscience screens (JB screen HTS I) and were further optimized by microbatch under oil. The best crystals were obtained when a volume of 1.5 ml of protein solution was mixed with 1.5 ml of reservoir solution containing 14% (w/v) PEG 8000, 550 mM KCl and 12% glycerol. Crystals grew to a size of ,0.05 mm £ 0.08 mm £ 0.3 mm in one day. Prior to mounting, crystals were soaked for ,30 seconds in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of reservoir solution with the glycerol concentration increased to 20.5% (w/v), picked up in a nylon loop, and flash cooled at 100 K in a nitrogen gas cold stream (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). Synchrotron data were collected at beamline X8C, NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Complete MAD datasets were collected at three wavelengths (Table 1) using a Quantum 4-CCD detector ° (Area Detector Systems Corp.) to 2.8 A resolution. Diffraction data were processed using the program HKL2000.39 The crystals belong to space group P212121 ° ° ° with a ¼ 52.4 A, b ¼ 76.4 A, c ¼ 85.8 A and Z ¼ 4. Subsequently, a high-resolution, single-wavelength dataset ° was collected to 1.8 A for refinement. Structure solution and refinement For phase determination, the resolution range from ° ° 20 A to 2.9 A was chosen. Nine of ten expected Se sites for the DRluD molecule were found using the program SOLVE.40 The resulting phases gave an overall figure-ofmerit (FOM) of 0.57. Further improvement in the phases was performed by using the program RESOLVE,41 resulting in an increase of the overall FOM to 0.67. The starting electron density map was further improved by phase ° extension to 1.8 A using the program wARP,42 which was able to build , 80% of the model. The remaining parts of the model were built manually using the program O.43 Further cycles of model building alternating with refinement using the program CNS44 resulted in the final model, with an R-factor of 0.218 ðRfree ¼ 0:243Þ ° to 1.8 A resolution with no s-cutoff used during

Experimental Procedures
Limited proteolysis and N-terminal sequencing of RluD A sample (12 mg) of purified, full-length RluD in buffer (20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol) was incubated 1:100 (w/w) with elastase (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC) for 30 minutes to two hours. Reactions were terminated by addition of PMSF to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and incubated on ice. Digestion products were analyzed by SDS/12% (w/v) PAGE. For N-terminal sequencing, RluD digested with elastase was transferred to a PVDF membrane and sequenced for five cycles by automated Edman degradation using a 470A gas-phase protein sequenator (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cloning and purification A fragment of the rluD gene consisting of residues 68 ­ 326 (DRluD) was amplified by PCR from E. coli O157:H7 genomic DNA36 and cloned into a derivative of the pET-15b vector (Amersham Pharmacia) containing a non-cleavable in-frame N-terminal fusion with (His)6. Plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli DL4137 for selenomethionine protein production. The transformed bacteria were grown at 37 8C to an A600 of , 0.8 in defined LeMaster medium supplemented with 25 mg/l of L -selenomethionine (Calbiochem). A one liter culture was induced with 100 mM IPTG and the culture continued at room temperature for an additional 15 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000g, 4 8C, 25 minutes) and re-suspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0), 400 mM NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 30 mM imidazole, 10 mM b-mercapthoethanol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) in which one tablet of Completee EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail
