Abstract  Anthrax edema factor (EF) is a key virulence factor secreted by Bacillus anthracis. Here, we report a structure, at 3.0 A resolution, of the catalytic domain of EF (EF3) in complex with calmodulin (CaM) and adenosine 50 -(a,b-methylene)-triphosphate (AMPCPP). Although the binding of the triphosphate of AMPCPP to EF3 can be superimposed on that of previously determined 30 deoxy-ATP (30 dATP) and 20 deoxy 30 anthraniloyl-ATP (20 d30 ANT-ATP) in EF3-CaM, the ribose and the adenine rings of AMPCPP are rotated approximately 105 and 180°, respectively, relative to those of 30 dATP and 20 d30 ANT-ATP. Based on this model, K382 and F586 should play key roles in the recognition of adenine. However, mutations of these residues to alanine either separately or together cause only modest changes in Michaelis­Menten constants and IC50 values of AMPCPP and cAMP. Therefore, this alternate binding mode of the adenosine of AMPCPP binds to EF likely playing only a minor role in ATP binding and in catalysis. Ó 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a prototypic second messenger that is crucial for many physiological responses including sugar and lipid metabolism, fight or flight responses, and hormone secretion. Some pathogenic bacteria, such as those that cause cholera, whooping cough, and anthrax, secrete virulence factors that cause the unregulated increase of intracellular cAMP. Edema factor is a virulence factor secreted by Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium that causes anthrax. It has calcium- and calmodulin (CaM)dependent adenylyl cyclase activity [1,2]. EF has two

functional domains: the C-terminal 58 kDa domain of EF binds CaM with 20 nM affinity and has a catalytic rate that is 1000-fold higher than that of mammalian CaMactivated adenylyl cyclase [3,4]. The N-terminal 30-kDa domain of EF shares 35% sequence identity with the N-terminal domain of lethal factor (LF), an anthrax virulence factor that has zinc metalloprotease activity and can specifically cleave the N-terminus of mitogen-activating protein kinase kinase [5,6]. This shared domain binds protective antigen (PA), another anthrax virulence factor that is responsible for delivering EF and LF into host cells [7,8]. EF is important for the survival of anthrax bacteria in macrophages as well as in modulating the profile of cytokines produced by human monocytes [9,10]. EF collaborates with LF and PA to cause toxemia [11­14]. Toxemia in conjunction with rapid growth of anthrax bacteria makes anthrax deadly [15­18]. We have recently solved structures of the 58 kDa catalytic domain of EF by itself, in complex with CaM,

and in complex with CaM and two non-cyclizable ATP analogs, 30 deoxy-ATP (30 d-ATP) and 20 d-30 anthraniloyl-ATP (20 d-30 -ANT-ATP) [2,19]. In these structures, adenine is recognized by a main chain carboxyl group of two threonines (548 and 579). A single ytterbium ion coordinated by two aspartates (D491 and D493) and a histidine (H577) was proposed to mimic a magnesium ion that could serve to stabilize the binding of ATP and the transition-state intermediate. Histidine 351 is positioned to interact with the 30 hydroxyl group even though a 30 OH is lacking in both analogs. Thus, histidine 351 was proposed to act as a catalytic base. Although the catalytic mechanism proposed for EF is consistent with the mutational data, the lack of 30 hydroxyl group in the two non-cyclizable ATP analogs, 30 d-ATP and 20 d-30 ANT-ATP, we have used in our structural analysis does not provide the direct proof for the interaction between 30 OH and H351 [19]. In this paper, we use adenosine 50 -(a,b-methylene)-triphosphate (AMPCPP) in an attempt to see whether we could demonstrate the interaction between the 30 hydroxyl group and H351. We report our surprising finding that the structure of EF-CaM-AMPCPP reveals a novel mode of adenosine binding to EF which is distinct from the binding of 30 dATP to EF, as well as our effort to address the role of this alternative binding mode in ATP binding to EF and catalysis.

Materials. QuikChange Kit was from Biocrest Manufacturing L P. Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad. Ni2þ ­NTA resin and anti-H5 antisera were from Qiagen. Adenosine 50 -(a,b-methylene)-triphosphate (AMPCPP) was purchased from Sigma­Aldrich. Structure determination of EF3-CaM-AMPCPP complex. The catalytic domains of EF and EF mutants and the recombinant calmodulin were purified as described [2,4,20]. To determine the structure of EF3CaM-AMPCPP, crystals of EF3-CH6 -CaM complex were grown using vapor diffusion, soaked with 5 mM AMPCPP during cryoprotection, and frozen in liquid nitrogen as described [21]. Data were collected at 100K at NSLS X25 and processed with the program Denzo and Scalepack [22]. Initial phase was obtained by difference Fourier method using CNS and a model of the EF3-CaM complex. The model was refined and built using CNS, Turbo-Frodo and O. The coordinates for EF3-CaM-AMPCPP have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (Accession code 1S26). Adenylyl cyclase assay. Adenylyl cyclase activities were measured after 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mM ATP with trace amounts of 32 P-ATP, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2 , and 1 lM free Ca2þ . ATP and cAMP were separated by Dowex and alumina columns as described [4].

AMPCPP has been used to study the structural basis of the catalytic mechanism of numerous enzymes such as b-lactam synthetase from Streptomyces clavuligerus [23], pantothenate synthetase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [24], and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli [25]. Recent structural analysis reveals that AMPCPP perfectly represents the binding of ATP in the crystal structure of b-lactam synthetase in complex with AMPCPP/Mg2þ /N2 -

AMPCPP to inhibit EF is 0.85 mM, which is similar to the Km value of ATP (0.3­1 mM) and the Kd value of 30 dATP (0.3 mM) [2,27]. The EF3-CaM crystals were then soaked with AMPCPP and the structure of EF3-CaM complexed  with AMPCPP was determined to 3.0 A resolution (Table 1). The structure of EF-CaM-AMPCPP is similar to the previously reported structures of EF3-CaM (Fig. 2A) [2,19]. The AMPCPP molecule is clearly visible in the active site of EF based on the simulated annealing omit map contoured at 3r (Supplemental Fig. 1). The binding of triphosphate of AMPCPP and an ytterbium ion to the catalytic site of EF is similar to those of 20 dATP and 20 d30 ANT-ATP. The triphosphate is coordinated by a metal ion (Yb3þ ) and salt bridges with several positively charged residues, R329, K372, and K346. Additionally, the c-phosphate is stabilized by S354. The conformation of adenosine moiety of 30 dATP and 20 d30 ANT-ATP in complex with EF-CaM is superimposable (Fig. 2C, Supplemental Fig. 2) [2]. Surprisingly, the ribose ring of AMPCPP is rotated 105° in comparison with 30 dATP and 20 d30 ANT-ATP, while the adenine ring of AMPCPP is rotated approximately 180° (Figs. 2B and C). Consequently, there are noticeable differences in the molecular interactions between the catalytic site of EF3 and AMPCPP in comparison to those with 30 d-ATP or 20 d30 -ANT-ATP. First, hydrogen bonds of adenine N6 in 30 d-ATP and 20 d30 ANT-ATP with the main chains of T548 and T579 are replaced by a hydrogen bond between atom N6 in AMPCPP and the side chain (atom NZ) of K382 and hydrophobic interactions with F586 and H351 in the EF3-CaM-AMPCPP structure (Figs. 2B and C). Second, the atom ND of N583 forms a hydrogen bond with the 30 OH of AMPCPP instead of the O40 of the ribose in 30 dATP and 20 d30 ANT-ATP (Figs. 2B and C). Interestingly, the adenine ring of AMPCPP occupies a binding pocket similar to that in which the anthraniloyl group of 20 d30 ANT-ATP binds. Such alternate binding of substrate analogs in crystal soaking is not uncommon and has been found in crystal structures of other enzymes such as thymidylate synthase from Lactobacillus casei [28]. Mutational analysis to distinguish whether 30 d-ATP/ 20 d30 ANT-ATP or AMPCPP represents productive ATP binding and catalysis As described above, the triphosphate portions of AMPCPP and 30 dATP are similar in their binding to the catalytic site of EF3, while the adenosines of these two non-cyclizable ATP analogs differ drastically in their binding to EF3. All atoms that interact with the adenine moiety of 30 dATP are from the main chain of EF, making mutational analysis difficult. However, the side chains of residues K382 and F586 make crucial contact

with the adenine of AMPCPP but not with that of 30 dATP. Thus, we mutated these two residues to alanine either individually or together (Supplemental Fig. 3). We expected to see these mutants had significant change in Michaelis­Menten constants. However, steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that all three EF3 mutants, EF3-K382A, EF3-F586A, and EF3-K382A-F586A, had sensitivity to CaM activation similar to wild type EF3 and only modest change in their Michaelis­Menten constants (Fig. 3 and Table 2). We also tested the ability of AMPCPP to inhibit these three EF3 mutants. IC50 values of AMPCPP for these three mutants were only slightly elevated (Table 2). To test the possibility that the binding mode of AMPCPP may represent the binding of products, cAMP and pyrophosphate (PPi), we assayed the adenylyl cyclase activity of these EF3 mutants in the presence of increased concentrations of cAMP or PPi. We found that the IC50 value for cAMP to inhibit EF3 mutants was only slightly elevated and no shift was observed for the IC50 value for inhibition by PPi (Table 2 and Supplemental Fig. 4). In the EF3-CaM-AMPCPP structure, the distance between the nucleophilic oxygen atom of the 30 hydroxyl  group and the a-phosphorus atom is 5.6 A, a long distance for a nucleophilic attack. Although the 30 hydroxyl group is also positioned too far to interact with the putative catalytic base, H351, it forms hydrogen bonds with N583 of EF3 (Fig. 2B). For asparagine to facilitate catalysis, we hypothesized that it would form hydrogen bonds to stabilize the transition state intermediate, similar to glutamine 61 in p21 RAS [29] or glutamine 204 in the a subunit of the heterotrimeric Gi protein [30]. In this model, glutamine may be replaced by glutamic acid [31] and asparagine may be replaced by aspartic acid without causing a dramatic effect on the

a The adenylyl cyclase assay was performed with wild type EF (1.8 ng) and EF mutants K382A (1.8 ng), F586A (1.8 ng), K382A-F586A(1.8 ng) at 30 °C for 9 min in the presence of 5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05 mM CaCl2 . b EC50 , was determined using CaM concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 nM in 10-fold increments and the results were fit to a simple rectangular hyperbola. c Km was determined using ATP concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 0.24 mM with the interval of 0.03 mM in the presence of 1.0 lM CaM and the results were fit using SigmaPlot enzyme kinetic module 1.1. d IC50 was determined using AMPCPP concentration ranging from 0 to 3 mM in threefold increments, cAMP concentration ranging from 0 to 40 mM in twofold increments, or PPi concentration ranging from 0 to 3 mM in threefold increments.

catalytic rate. We have previously reported that the mutation of asparagine 583 to alanine, histidine or glutamine caused a reduction of about two orders of magnitude in catalytic activity without a significant reduction in sensitivity to CaM or in Km values [19]. To explore the role of N583 in stabilizing the transition state intermediate, we mutated N583 to aspartic acid. We found that EF3-N583D had 100-fold reduction in activity (Vmax is 44 sÀ1 for EF3-N583D and 5975 sÀ1 for wild type EF3) with only minor alteration in Km values (Km is 1.6 mM for N583D and 0.6 mM for wild type) or in sensitivity to CaM activation (Fig. 3). This reduction was similar to EF3 mutants in which the N583 residue was mutated to alanine, histidine, or glutamine [19]. These data argue against the hypothesis that asparagine acts to coordinate the transition state.

AMPCPP adopts an alternative binding mode, indicating that such mode likely plays a minor role in ATP binding and catalysis. As described above, our mutational analysis has added experimental data to support this hypothesis and strengthens the hypothesis that the binding of 30 dATP to EF in the structure of EF3-CaM30 dATP mimics the binding of EF to ATP and subsequent catalysis. Interestingly, the pocket for the alternative binding mode of adenine is a key for the 100fold increased affinity of EF for 20 d30 ANT-ATP than for ATP [2]. This pocket may be a key for generating small molecule inhibitors specifically targeted against adenylyl cyclase toxins from several human pathogens including those that cause anthrax, whooping cough, and nosocomial infection [20].

Acknowledgments Conclusion The relatively high catalytic rate of EF-CaM (1­2 msÀ1 ) and the stabilization of EF3-CaM crystals by ytterbium ions have made it difficult to determine the structure of EF-CaM in complex with the physiological substrate, Mg2þ -ATP [2]. To circumvent this problem, we have determined structures of EF-CaM in complex with several non-cyclizable ATP analogs, 30 dATP, 20 d30 ANT-ATP, and AMPCPP [2,19]. In addition, we have recently found that adefovir diphosphate, the cellular metabolite of a clinically approved anti-viral drug, can inhibit the activity of EF with 27 nM Ki [32]. Adefovir is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate and the structure of EF-CaM in complex with adefovir diphos phate has also been determined to 3.3 A resolution [32]. Furthermore, we have also determined the structure of EF-CaM in complex with the catalytic products, cAMP  and pyrophosphate, to 3.3 A resolution (Guo Qing, Shen Yuequan, and Tang Wei-Jen, unpublished data). From these five structures, only the adenine moiety of
