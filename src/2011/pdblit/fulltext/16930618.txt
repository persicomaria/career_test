The Dimerization Domain of HNF-1a : Structure and a Plasticity of an Intertwined Four-helix Bundle with Application to Diabetes Mellitus
Narendra Narayana, Qing-xin Hua and Michael A. Weiss*
Department of Biochemistry Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland OH 44106-4935, USA Maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young (MODY) is a human genetic syndrome most commonly due to mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1a (HNF-1a). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the HNFÊ 1a dimerization domain at 1.7 A resolution and assess its structural plasticity. The crystal's low solvent content (23 %, v/v) leads to tight packing of peptides in the lattice. Two independent dimers, similar in structure, are formed in the unit cell by a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis. The dimers de®ne a novel intertwined four-helix bundle (4HB). Each protomer contains two a-helices separated by a sharp non-canonical turn. Dimer-related a-helices form anti-parallel coiled-coils, including an N-terminal ``mini-zipper'' complementary in structure, symmetry and surface characteristics to transcriptional coactivator dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 (DCoH). A con¯uence of ten leucine side-chains (®ve per protomer) forms a hydrophobic core. Isotope-assisted NMR studies demonstrate that a similar intertwined dimer exists in solution. Comparison of structures obtained in multiple independent crystal forms indicates that the mini-zipper is a stable structural element, whereas the C-terminal a-helix can adopt a broad range of orientations. Segmental alignment of the mini-zipper (mean pairwise root-mean-square difference (rmsd) in Ca Ê Ê coordinates of 0.29 A) is associated with a 2.1 A mean Ca rmsd displacement of the C-terminal coiled-coil. The greatest C-terminal structural variÊ ation (4.1 A Ca rmsd displacement) is observed in the DCoH-bound peptide. Diabetes-associated mutations perturb distinct structural features of the HNF-1a domain. One mutation (L12H) destabilizes the domain but preserves structural speci®city. Adjoining H12 side-chains in a native-like dimer are predicted to alter the functional surface of the minizipper involved in DCoH recognition. The other mutation (G20R), by contrast, leads to a dimeric molten globule, as indicated by its 1H-NMR features and ¯uorescent binding of 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate. We propose that a glycine-speci®c turn con®guration enables speci®c interactions between the mini-zipper and the C-terminal coiled-coil.

An Intertwined Four-helix Bundle in HNF-1

Introduction
Maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young (MODY) is a monogenic human syndrome arising from impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by the pancreatic b cell in the islet of Langerhans.1 Six MODY genes have been identi®ed, ®ve of which encode speci®c transcription factors. The most common form (MODY3) is caused by heterozygous mutations in hepatic nuclear factor HNF-1a.2 ± 8 Although HNF-1a is also an important regulator of hepatic and renal gene expression, the MODY3 phenotype is restricted to the pancreatic b-cell{. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in human HNF-1a have not been observed and are presumably incompatible with post-natal life. Homozygous disruption of HNF1a in the mouse leads to massive liver failure, Fanconi's renal dysfunction, and perinatal death.9 In the b-cell, HNF-1a functions as a weak activator of the insulin gene and a putative cassette of genes required for regulated insulin secretion.10,11 This HNF-1a-regulated cassette is not well characterized. HNF-1a is composed of four functional regions: an amino-terminal dimerization domain (residues 1-32); a bipartite DNA-binding motif with variant homeodomain (residues 98-280); a carboxy-terminal transactivation domain (281-631); and a ¯exible linker (residues 33-97) that connects the dimerization and DNA-binding domains.12 ± 15 Excepting this linker, MODY mutations occur in each region.16,17 The present study focuses on the N-terminal dimerization domain,18,19 an autonomous module12,14,20,21 required for the protein's gene-regulatory activity.8 This module also functions as a target of transcriptional coactivator dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 (DCoH).22 ± 30 An homologous leucine-rich motif occurs in HNF-1b (also a MODY gene)31 and mediates combinatorial homo- and heterodimerization.32 The structure of the dimerization domain has been investigated by circular dichroism (CD) and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. Although initially proposed to form a leucine zipper (LZ; parallel coiled-coil), NMR studies have demonstrated the presence of a helix-turn-helix secondary structure.21 Possible solution structures based on parallel or anti-parallel
{ Designation of HNF-1a as a hepatic factor re¯ects the history of its discovery and role in liver-speci®c gene regulation.15 Heterozygous mutations in the coding region or promoter of the human HNF-1a gene have no known effect on hepatic function in contrast to impairment of b-cell function.10 { In crystallographic studies of the HNF-p1/DCoH complex,35 a-helical orientations in the intermolecular 4HB were described as opposite to those predicted.34 This is incorrect: predicted and observed helical orientations are congruent (see the Supplementary Material).

four-helix bundles (4HB) have been proposed.33,34 We have recently suggested that residues 8-19 and 19H -8H comprise an anti-parallel coiled-coil (``minizipper'') along one face of the 4HB and that this face mediates binding of HNF-1a to the saddleshaped coactivator DCoH.34 Recruitment of DCoH (not itself a DNA-binding protein) into a speci®c preinitiation complex, although not necessary for HNF-1a/DNA recognition, enhances by HNF-1adirected transcriptional activation.30 Symmetrybased modeling suggested that the HNF-1a minizipper sits atop the saddle to form an intermolecular four-helix bundle{.34 Essential features of this model have been veri®ed recently by X-ray crystallography (Figure 1(a)).35 We describe here the crystal structure of the Ê dimerization domain of HNF-1a at 1.7 A resolution. Experimental phases were obtained by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion using selenomethionine (MSe) as scatterer. Because the native amino-terminal methionine residue was not suf®ciently ordered, MSe was substituted for one of the leucine side-chains. The structure reveals an intertwined a-helical dimer anti-parallel in orientation. ``Eisenberg''-like helix swapping36,37 between protomers leads to a novel intertwined topology. Because such swapping was unanticipated by previous NMR models,33,34 we have reinvestigated the structure in solution. Dimer-related nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), de®ned by asymmetric 13C-isotopic labeling,38 are consistent with the overall orientation of protomers as observed in the crystal structure. Flexibility among N and C-terminal segments is observed in solution and rationalizes patterns of thermal (B) factors. Recent independent crystallographic analyses of the HNF-1a domain by Alber and co-workers39 enable comparison of the peptide structure in different crystal forms and lattice environments. Such comparison suggests that the 4HB contains a rigid element (the mini-zipper) and an adjustable element (variably oriented C-terminal a-helices). These elements are connected by a tight turn unrelated to classical b- or g-turn families.40,41 Diabetes-associated mutations in this turn and adjoining N-terminal a-helix2,5,42 destabilize the 4HB by distinct mechanisms. Whereas a destabilizing mutation in the mini-zipper (L12H) preserves the domain's architectural speci®city, a mutation in the turn (G20R) leads to a molten globule. We propose that a glycine-speci®c turn architecture is required for speci®c packing of side-chains of the C-terminal coiled-coil against side-chains of the N-terminal mini-zipper. Studies of the diabetes-associated variants suggest that a frustrated turn alters the global topography of the free-energy landscape.

Results
The crystal structure (HNF-1a residues 1-32 with W33 extension{ and MSe13 substitution{; designated HNF-p1w) was determined by multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing and re®ned Ê to 1.7 A resolution (Rcryst0.231 and Rfree0.245; see Table 1). Electron density (2FoÀFc) corresponding to residues 10-16 is shown in Figure 1(c). The asymmetric unit contains two independent polypeptides and 55 ordered water molecules}. The polypeptide molecules are not related by the physiological dimer axis (see below). Molecule 1 is better ordered than molecule 2; respective mean Ê Ê thermal B-factors are 15.9 A and 23.0 A2. The con®gurations of non-glycine residues are in the most preferred region of the Ramachandran plot. Residue G20 in each polypeptide is in the generously allowed L-region adjoining the aL island. Molecules 1 and 2 each contain two a-helices connected by a sharp reversal segment, rendering a V shape to the protomer's overall architecture (Figure 1(b)). The angle between a-helices is 37 in each case. Alignment of the two polypeptides by least-squares superposition of main-chain atoms
{ HNF-p1w differs from the peptide studied by Alber and colleagues (HNF-p1)35 by the presence of an additional C-terminal tryptophan-amide (W33; in place of P33 in native HNF-1a sequence), N-terminal substitution of methionine by norleucine, and substitution of L13 by MSe for MAD phasing. W33 appears to stabilize the structure,34 presumably via sidechain contacts observed in solution and not re¯ected in the crystal structure (see the Supplementary Material). Norleucine was employed to avoid methionine oxidation. Se-Met at position 13 was also employed by Rose et al. 39 for MAD phasing. { Substitution of L13 by MSe has no effect on the a-helix content of the HNF-1a dimer, as inferred by CD. However, the variant dimer is less stable; ÁÁGu, as estimated by CD-detected guanidine titration, is 2.4(Æ0.2) kcal/mol (see the Supplementary Material). The relative orientation of N and C-terminal a-helices in the crystal structure of HNF-p1w differs from that seen in the DCoH co-crystal structure. 35 These differences are retained in a preliminary electron-density map of native (L13) HNF-p1w peptide crystals (N.N. and M.A.W., unpublished results) and so are unrelated to the MSe13 substitution. Similar results have been obtained by Rose et al.,39 who provide ®ve sets of dimer-speci®c coordinates: (i) and (ii) two independent dimers in the asymmetric unit in wild-type HNF-p1; (iii) and (iv) two independent dimers of an MSe12 analogue and (v) one MSe-13 analogue. Of these ®ve dimers, only the MSe-13 structure exhibits exact 2-fold symmetry in the dimer. Quantitative comparisons of these and the present structure are described in Discussion (Figures 7 and 8, and Table 4). } In deposited coordinates, residues in molecules 1 and 2 are labeled 1-33 and 36-63, respectively. Residues 34, 35, and 64-66 are disordered and hence absent from the coordinate set. The 55 ordered water molecules are numbered 67-121. In the text and Figures, primed labels denote dimer-related residues.

(residues 3-30) yields a root-mean-square deviation Ê (rmsd) of 0.24 A. Because molecule 1 is better ordered than molecule 2, analysis focuses on molecule 1 unless otherwise stated. Residues 1-3 form an extended strand followed by a-helix 1 (residues 4-19), a sharp turn (20-22), a-helix 2 (residues 23-32) and Ê W33. No interhelical interaction (<3.5 A) is observed in the protomer. Within the asymmetric unit, molecules 1 and 2 are connected loosely through a-helices 2 and 2H (interface depicted in Supplementary Material). The surface area buried Ê at this interface is only 846 A2. By contrast, molecules 1 and 2 each form extensive interactions with another polypeptide in the unit cell related by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis (Figure 1(b)). The surface area buried at this interÊ face is 1741 A2. The putative symmetry-related dimer is consistent with prior analyses of NOEs in solution33,34 and in accord with the co-crystal structure of a HNF-p1/DCoH complex (Figure 1(a)).35 We therefore regard this symmetry-related packing as the biological dimer. The orientation between protomers within dimers 1 and 2 in the unit cell are essentially identical. Dimer topology and interactions between protomers a-Helices 1 and 2 each form anti-parallel coiledcoils with dimer-related mates to de®ne opposite surfaces of the 4HB. Each coiled-coil remains contiguous throughout its length. Helix 1 contacts helix 2H , whereas helix 1H contacts helix 2. Despite this novel topology, individual coiled-coils are separately superimposable on those of a conventional 4HB (see Supplementary Material). As expected,43,44 the helices in HNF-p1w contain 3.6 residues per turn. Distances of closest approach Ê between helical axes are 10.9 A (N-terminal coiledÊ coil) and 9.3 A (C-terminal coiled-coil). In accord with classical expectations,45 the angle between helices 1 and 1H is 30  and that between helices 2 and 2H is 23  . The crossing angle between N and C-terminal coiled-coils is 26  . Although the overall structure resembles that observed in a peptideDCoH complex35 and peptide dimers in different crystallographic environments,39 the precise orientation of coiled-coils differs (see Discussion and Supplementary Material). The dimer interface is stabilized by extensive hydrophobic and van der Waal's interactions between protomers and by symmetry-related hydrogen bonds between the side-chains Q9 and S19H (and likewise between Q9H and S19). Unlike coiled-coils,44,46 there is no salt-bridges between protomers. The dimer's hydrophobic core contains a cluster of leucine side-chains. A prominent feature is the packing of L12 and MSe13 (L13 in the native sequence) against L12H , MSe13H , L16H , L21H , and L26H (Figure 2). Eight leucine and two MSe side-chains thus contribute to the intertwined interface. The side-chains of L12 and L12H (a site of

The N-terminal portion of helix 1 contacts the symmetry-related turn as the side-chain of Q9 contacts S19H , G20H , and L21H . The side-chains of K23, L26, I27, A29, L30, E32, and W33 (and their symmetry-related mates) mediate interactions between helix 2 and helix 2H . At the interface between helices 1 and 2H , key contacts occur between the side-chains of MSe13 and L17 (helix 1) and L26H (helix 2H ). L17 also contacts A29H and E32H . Preliminary studies of isomorphic crystals containing the native L13 peptide Ê reveal an essentially identical structure at 1.7 A resolution with ten leucine side-chains in the core. Of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, electron density for W33 is seen only in molecule 1. Ê The indole side-chain is surrounded (<4.5 A) by residues 29 through 32 and L17H , L21H , S22H , K23H , and L26H (see the Supplementary Material) The main-chain amide nitrogen atom of W33 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of G31 and so provides a C-cap to a-helix 2. Lattice contacts to W33 in molecule 1 are observed from symmetry-related (in addition to dimer-related) polypeptides; these lattice contacts involve residues 1-5.

The intertwined 4HB contains a noncanonical turn a-Helix 1 is connected to a-helix 2 by a sharp turn whose structure differs from that of classical b or g-turn families.40,41,47 The turn (comprising residues 19-22) exhibits successive backbone (f,c) angles of (78.7  , À0.5  ), (97.0  , 23.7  ), (À52.6  , 136.4  ), and (À85.5  , 156.3  ). Similar torsion angles occur in diverse crystallographic environments39 and in the peptide-DCoH complex.35 Whereas the angle between helices 1 and 2 in the present structure is 37  , however, that in the bound peptide is 65  .35 The conformation of the turn's second residue (G20) lies in the right side of the Ramachandran plot (i.e. positive f angle near the aL island). Although G20 is invariant among mammalian HNF-1a and HNF-1b sequences (Figure 3), L-amino acids would not be excluded on the basis of a Ramachandran criterion. Molecular modelling nonetheless suggests that the b carbon atom of an L-amino acid would clash with the carbonyl oxygen atom of the preceding residue (S19). The mutation G20R has been observed in a MODY pedigree42 and causes a profound decrement in the dimer's thermodynamic stability (ÁÁGu > 4 kcal/mol (1 cal  4.184 J); Table 2).34

Flexible regions and disorder Electron density is well de®ned for all residues in molecule 1, whereas in molecule 2 the N-terminal two and C-terminal three residues are disordered. Mean main-chain B-factors for a-helix 1 in Ê molecules 1 and 2 are 12.6 and 16.5 A2, respectÊ ively, and for a-helix 2, 14.1 and 29.2 A2, respectively. Corresponding side-chain B-values for Ê a-helix 1 in molecules 1 and 2 are 18.0 and 19.5 A2, Ê respectively, and for a-helix 2, 21.8 and 30.5 A2, respectively. (Residue-speci®c B-factors are provided as Supplementary Material.) The apparent ¯exibility of residues 1-2 and 31-33, as inferred from higher thermal values in molecule 1 and absence of density in molecule 2, is corroborated by 1H-NMR motional narrowing.34 Whereas the

dimer's secondary structure in solution as de®ned by NOEs comprises a-helices 8-19 and 22-29 (see the Supplementary Material), the N-terminal a-helices in the crystal extend from residues 4-19 in both molecules in the asymmetric unit. This difference in helical length is unlikely to be due to the presence of an organic cosolvent (25 % methyl-2,4pentane-diol; MPD) under conditions of crystallization, as the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the dimer is unaffected by the cosolvent (see the Supplementary Material). Previous NMR analyses employed NOE patterns (such as strong dNN and nested (i,i  3) daN contacts) to delimit a-helices.21,33,34 It is possible that such analyses, although assigning stable helical elements correctly, failed to discern a signi®cant helical bias among an ensemble of populated

N-terminal structures. To investigate this possibility, nascent helical propensity was probed by two additional and independent NMR parameters: (i) 1Ha and 13Ca chemical shifts;48 and (ii) conformationally sensitive 3JaN coupling constants.49,50 Whereas residues in the 8-18 and 23-30 segments exhibit 3JaN values less than 5 Hz in accord with their helical NOE patterns, 3JaN values of residues 4-6 are 6.7, 6.8 and 6.0 Hz, respectively (3JaN of residue 7 could not be obtained due to line-broadening). Further, whereas the 1Ha and 13Ca chemical shift index for residues 7-18 and 23-30 is consistent with a-helix, index values for residues 4-6 are inconsistent with helix. These results suggest that residues 4-6 do not exhibit a strong a-helical bias in solution. Accordingly, we imagine that the environment of residues 1-7 in the crystal lattice favors N-terminal extension of a-helix 1. In the crystal structure of the DCoH-bound peptide35 a-helix 1 begins at residue 6, intermediate between the NOE-de®ned a-helix in solution and that observed in the present structure. The solution structure resembles the crystal structure To investigate the relationship between the topology of the dimer in the crystal and in solution, a uniformly 13C-labeled peptide was prepared in Escherichia coli and mixed with the unlabeled peptide to obtain an equilibrium between isotopic homodimers and heterodimers. NOEs were then identi®ed between 13C-attached protons and 12 C-attached protons at the dimer interface. Dimerrelated NOEs diagnostic of an intertwined topology are in overall accord with the crystal structure (Table 3). The phase of the mini-zipper is

de®ned by contacts between side-chains, L12-L16H , MSe13-MSe13H , and L13-L16H . Contiguity between the C-terminal helices is established by contacts between K23-L30H , K23-W33H , L26-L26H , L26-L30H and I27-W33H . The intertwined helix 1/2H relationship is veri®ed by contacts between side-chains MSe13-L26H and L17-W33H . Representative NOE data and corresponding structural crystal models are provided in Figure 4. Within interacting sidechains, the details of which protons are in closest proximity across the dimer interface can differ between crystal and solution structure (unpublished results). Dimer-related NOEs inconsistent with the crystal structure are observed involving the side-chains of L5, L8, and W33, presumably due to ¯exibility in solution (see the Supplementary Material). Similarly, W33-speci®c ring-current shifts predicted on the basis of the crystal structure of molecule 1 are not observed in solution (see the Supplementary Material) in accord with this residue's apparent disorder in molecule 2. Contrasting effects of clinical mutations Previous studies have established that mutations L12H and G20R permit native or near-native helix content (as inferred from CD) but perturb the stability of the dimer (Table 2).34 Thermodynamic parameters derived from guanidine denaturation studies by the two-state formalism suggest that the G20R mutation causes a larger decrement in stability (ÁÁGu À 5.0 kcal/mol) than does L12H (ÁÁGu À3.7 kcal/mol). The structural basis of this difference is enigmatic, as the L12H substitution in the dimer's non-polar interface would seem to be less conservative. Because this conclusion depends on the appropriateness of the two-state model, CD

Valine residues are found at positions 21 and 25 in HNF-1b compared to L21 and A25 in HNF-1a (T25 in chicken). These valine residues, proposed volume-®lling substitutions in HNF-1b, are bracketed. (b) The left ®gure represents a CPK model of a putative G21-G25 crevice obtained by modifying residues at position 21 and 25 in HNF-p1w protomer.

spectra were obtained as a function of peptide concentratrion (in the range 5-75 mM) as an explicit probe of the stability of the dimer. The spectrum of the native dimer is invariant in this concentration range in accord with its low dissociation constant (of the order of 1 nM; a precise estimate requires the assumption of no residual structure in the monomer). By contrast, the inferred values of ÁGu predict that the spectrum of the G20R analogue would exhibit marked concentration-dependent changes in this range, whereas the L12H analogue would exhibit slight but discernible changes. This is indeed observed (Figure 5). These data thus corroborate the order-of-magnitude estimates of ÁÁG provided by the two-state model. Nevertheless, the original CD titration studies by Hua et al.34 were

conducted at a peptide concentration of 5 mM, at which the G20R analogue (unlike native and L12H dimers) is substantially dissociated. To address the possibility that the unfolding curve and apparent ÁGu value (which presumably re¯ected only the fraction of dimer) were unreliable at this concentration, the guanidine titration was repeated at a peptide concentration of 60 mM to ensure a predominance of dimers. Although the unfolding curve is shifted to more negative (native-like) values of ellipticity (Figure 5), derived thermodynamic parameters are essentially unchanged (Table 2). The statistical r2-value is 0.9996. Inspection of the ®t between the two-state theoretical curve and the G20R titration data points at 60 mM reveals that systemic deviations occur

Distances shown represent carbon-carbon distances in crystal structure. Corresponding hydrogen-hydrogen distances were estimated using the Biopolymer facility of InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). a Dimer-related NOEs are observed between W33H C4H and a set of protons in helix 1 (T10 gCH3, L13 dCH3 and A14 bH3) that are inconsistent with the present structure (see the Supplementary Material) but would be consistent with the bound conformation35 if extended to W33 by model building. A dimer-related NOE is also observed between L5 dCH3 and L21H dCH3. This contact, involving the ¯exible N-terminal segment, is inconsistent with the present structure and that described by Rose et al.35 The methyl resonances of L5 exhibit anomalous broadening rather than motional narrowing (as exhibited by residues 1-3), presumably due to millisecond exchange among multiple conformations. b Dimer-related NOEs are observed between L17 d2-CH3 and W33H C4H, which were classi®ed correctly in the side-by-side model and are in accord with the present structure.

despite the reassuring r2 value (i.e. close to unity). Points fall beneath the line at guanidine concentrations 0-1 M, above the line at guanidine concentrations 1-3.5 M, beneath the line from 3.5-5 M, and above the line from 5-7 M (see the Supplementary Material). Such systematic deviations, not observed in ®tting the native and L12H transitions, are distinct from random scatter and suggest that the transition is not two-state. To investigate possible origins of the G20R analogue's anomalous titration behavior, 1H-NMR spectra were obtained (Figure 5(b)). Whereas native and L12H samples give rise to a spectrum typical of a globular domain (with sharp and well-resolved resonances; spectra (b)a and (b)b, respectively), the G20R dimer gives rise to an anomalous spectrum characterized by limited chemical-shift dispersion and differential line broadening (spectra (b)d and (b)e). Sharp 1H-NMR resonances from the ¯exible N terminus region are retained. The extent of line broadening is not signi®cantly affected by peptide concentration in the range 0.2-1.5 mM, suggesting that broadening is due to conformational exchange that is intermediate on the millisecond time-scale of NMR chemical shifts. Gel-®ltration chromatography at a peptide concentration of 0.5 mM under NMR conditions demonstrates that the G20R peptide is predominantly dimeric; no higher-order aggregation is observed. Line-broadening and limited dispersion preclude conventional 2D-NMR analysis (see the Supplementary Material). The extensive perturbations manifest in the NMR spectrum of the G20R analogue contrast with the

domain's near-native helix content as probed by CD. The anomalous NMR features of the G20R domain suggest that the variant dimer is an a-helical molten globule. Because G20 adopts a positive f angle in the crystal structures, we imagine that substitution by Arg could lead to frustration of the turn and could, in turn, disallow the native interdigitation of side-chains between N and C-terminal coiled-coils. Interconversion of the G20R structure among a range of non-optimal helix-packing schemes would rationalize both the analogue's non-two-state unfolding transition and anomalous NMR features. To test this model, we employed 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) as a probe of the molten-globule state{. The ANS ¯uorescence emission spectra of the native and L12H domains are similar in magnitude to that of a control globular protein (hen egg-white lysozyme). By contrast, enhanced ANS ¯uorescence emission is observed in the presence of the G20R domain at a peptide concentration of 100 mM. This enhancement is dimer-speci®c, as its extent diminishes as the peptide concentration is reduced, indicating, as expected, little or no binding of the dye to the monomer. The quality of the NMR spectrum of the L12H dimer, by contrast to that of the G20R dimer, permits conventional sequential assignment (see the Supplementary Material). The pattern of chemical shifts is similar to that of the native spectrum. Only ®ve residues (5, 9, 11, 15 and 16) exhibit changes in chemical shift greater than 0.1 ppm in magnitude (Table 2(b)), The largest change occurs at the Ha position of A15 (0.72 ppm) and may re¯ect the net ring currents of H12 and H12H . Small perturbations are observed at neighboring protons at positions 11 (0.1 ppm change in a g-methylene resonance) and 16 (0.2 ppm change in a methyl resonance related to L12 by (i,i  4) and dimer-related

NOEs suggests strongly that the variant side-chain is accommodated within a native-like fold. Surprisingly, the pK51 of the H12 imidazole ring (7.2) is a not shifted to low values, indicating that the variant structure is compatible with protonation of the imidazole side-chains.

Discussion
4HBs are ubiquitous structural motifs exhibiting a rich diversity of tertiary structures.52,53 Such motifs provide favorable models for studies of protein folding and design.54,55 Parallel dimeric 4HBs are of particular importance in transcription factors containing a helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain.56 ± 58 To our knowledge, the anti-parallel HNF-1a domain represents the smallest 4HB motif, a novel intertwined dimer. Mutations in this domain are associated with diabetes mellitus in humans.16,42,59,60 Comparison of HNF-p1 peptides in different crystal forms Crystal structures of related HNF-p1 peptides (see footnote to page 638) were described recently in independent studies by Alber and co-workers.39 While the manuscript was in review, multiple coordinate sets were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, permitting detailed comparison of structures. The coordinates were of the native HNF-p1 peptide and two Se-Met analogues at positions 12 and 13. Crystallization conditions and crystal forms in each case differ from those described here (a summary of crystallographic information is given in the Supplementary Material). The availability of multiple independent structures provides an opportunity to evaluate the conformational repertoire of the peptide structure and effects of crystal packing. Comparison of the present structure with those described by Rose et al.39 was performed by leastsquares superposition of equivalent atoms. Two alignment schemes were investigated. The ®rst employed an overall alignment of all main-chain atoms in the dimer. Residue-speci®c mean rmsd values for main-chain and side-chain atoms are shown in Figure 7(a) and (b). Whereas low mainchain rmsd values are observed for two structures (wild-type dimer bd and MSe-13 dimer; superimposed ®lled green and blue triangles, respectively), large values are observed throughout the sequence for one MSe12 dimer (designated ac; open red diamonds). For the other wild-type dimer (designated ac; open green triangles) and the other MSe12 dimer (designated bd; ®lled red diamonds), low rmsd values are observed in the mini-zipper and larger values in the C-terminal a-helices. In each case, side-chain rmsd values are lower in the interior than among solvent-exposed residues. Structural variability among C-terminal segments can give rise to extremely large side-chain rmsd Ê values (3-8 A). Of the ®ve independent dimers described by Rose et al.,39 the two most similar to that obtained here are the wild-type bd dimer and Ê MSe-13 dimer (mean main-chain rmsd of 0.25 A Ê and 0.24 A, respectively, for residues 5-28 and 5H 28H ). The overall main-chain alignment described above suggests an asymmetry in degree of struc-

Figure 6. Diagonal plots of (a) inter-residue NOEs in native dimer and (b) L12H variant dimer demonstrate structrural similarity. Contacts between side-chains are shown in lower right-hand triangles; contacts between main-chain atoms or between main-chain and side-chain atoms are shown in upper left-hand triangles. Red boxes in (a) indicate dimer-related NOEs, including those given in Table 2B; green boxes in (a) indicate contacts likely to include both intraprotomeric and dimer-related contributions. Blue boxes in (b) highlight contacts by mutant H12 side-chain. No distinction is made in (b) between intraprotomeric and dimer-related contacts as isotope-edited spectra were not obtained. Contacts a-e in (a) are present in native spectrum but not in that of L12H variant, whereas contact a in (b) is present in the variant spectrum but not in the native spectrum.

Figure 7. Comparison of HNF-p1 peptide structures by rmsd in two alignment schemes. (a) and (b) Alignment according to the main-chain atoms including all four helices in the dimer (residues 5-28 and symmetry-related mates) suggests the extent of overall structural variation. (c) and (d) Alignment according to the main-chain atoms of minizipper only (residues 5-19 and symmetry-related mates) highlights the segmental mobility of the C-terminal coiledcoil and invariance of N-terminal mini-zipper. Five peptide dimers determined by Rose et al.39 are compared to molecule 1 of the present study. Abbreviations used for peptide dimers are the same as in Table 4, Wt-ac (open green triangles), wt-bd (®lled green triangles), MSe12-ac (open red diamonds), MSe12-bd (®lled red diamonds), and MSe-13 (®lled blue triangles). Main-chain rmsd values are shown in (a) and (c), whereas side-chain rmsd values are shown in (b) and (d). In each panel, positions of the four helices are indicated by ®lled or open bars at top. Because HNF-p1 dimers except MSe-13 lack exact 2-fold symmetry39 (unlike the present crystal form), rmsd values for residues 1-32 and 1H -32H are depicted separately. Values for residues whose positions were not de®ned in the electron density in the corresponding structure are omitted.

tural similarity or difference: larger rmsd values tend to occur in the C-terminal a-helix than in the N-terminal a-helix. To explore this apparent asymmetry further, we aligned the structures according to Ca atoms in (a) the N-terminal a-helix of an isolated protomer (residues 9-19) and (b) the mini-zipper (residues 9-19 and 9H -19H ). These alignments are illutrated in Figure 8. The protomer-speci®c alignment (Figure 8(a)) demonstrates close superposition of helix 1 with variable orientation of helix 2.

Converse protomer-speci®c alignment on helix 2 (not shown) likewise results in skew positions of helix 1. Dimer-speci®c alignment on the mini-zipper (Figures 7(c) and 8(b)) reveals invariance of the mini-zipper and variable positioning of the C-terminal coiled-coil. The converse alignment on the C-terminal coiled-coil (residues 23-28 and 23H -28H ) by contrast fails to yield a consistent view of the aligned helices (not shown). We therefore regard the mini-zipper alignment as providing physical

(a) Individual protomers of HNF-p1 dimers35 were aligned with equivalent Ca atoms of residues 9-19 of the present HNF-p1w protomer shown in red. The wild-type protomers are in cyan (PDB ID: 1g39), MSe12 protomers are in green (PDB ID: 1g2y), the MSe-13 protomer is in blue (PDB ID: 1g2z). Only Ca atoms are displayed in (a)-(c).

insight into the modular composition of the domain. Residue-speci®c rmsd values in this alignment are shown in Figure 7(c) and (d). An asymmetry in rmsd values between N and C-terminal helices is consistent and striking. An overview is provided by mean rmsd values for Ca atoms by segment (Table 4A); corresponding interhelical angles in HNF-p1 peptides are given in Table 4B. Whereas the angle between mini-zipper helices is nearly invariant, large variations are observed in all other inter-helical angles: the angle between N and C-terminal helices in a protomer, angle between C-terminal helices, and crossing-angle between mini-zipper and C-terminal coiled-coil. The variable tertiary structure of the C-terminal helices is reminiscent of a molten globule, a collapsed state containing ordered elements of secondary structure of variable orientation.61 The

precision of packing of the mini-zipper is, by contrast, characteristic of a native state. The HNF-1a dimerization domain provides a recognition surface for binding transcriptional coactivator DCoH.30 Differences between structures of free and bound peptides suggest that the HNF1a dimer undergoes a limited but detectable change in conformation upon binding to DCoH. In the absence of additional co-crystal structures, it is not known whether the distinctive structural features of the bound HNF-p1 dimer are a general consequence of DCoH binding or simply one of several possible bound conformations. The extent of induced ®t is thus an unresolved issue. Together, observations of higher thermal factors for helix-2 and different relative orientations between helix 2 and 2H in isolated and bound structures suggest that helix 2 is adjustable by rigid-

body movement. We propose that helix 2 can adopt different relative orientations without perturbing helix 1 and 1H (Figures 7 and 8), and is in agreement with the recent crystal structures of HNF-p1 peptides in different crystal forms.39 Relationship of structure in crystal and in solution The crystal structure of HNF-p1w differs from either parallel or anti-parallel 4HB models proposed on the basis of NMR studies.33,34 The antiparallel model successfully predicted the existence of an N-terminal coiled-coil (mini-zipper) in accord with dimer-related NOEs (9-19H and 9-21H ; Figure 4(a) and (c)). Nevertheless, the putative 4HB was envisaged as consisting of side-by-side protomers rather than intertwined a-helices.34 A major role in the NMR analysis was played by prominent long-range NOEs involving the indole resonances of W33 (Supplementary Material in Hua et al.).34 Although contacts between W33 and L17H were correctly interpreted in the original analyses, a side-by-side model was suggested by multiple additional NOEs from the indole ring to the sidechains of residues 10, 13, and 14. These are inconsistent with the crystal structure (see the Supplementary Material) but presumably arise due to ¯exibility in solution leading to multiple conformations. The criterion of consistency employed in the original distance-geometry (DG) modelling procedure34 did not consider possible confounding effects of multiple W33 conformations. Analysis of inferred interproton distances in the crystallographic dimer emphasizes the importance of NOEs between degenerate (symmetry-related) 1H-NMR resonances, unobservable in the absence of isotopic labeling. Asymmetric 13C labeling allows such contacts to be de®ned. Key examples are provided by strong NOEs between methyl resonances of MSe13-MSe13H and L26-L26H . These contacts, inconsistent with a side-by-side model, de®ne the phase

of the helix 1/1H and 2/2H contacts. A detailed description of the dimerH s solution structure and dynamics is in preparation. It is important to note that the confounding features of W33 in the original NMR analysis did not arise due to inclusion of a non-native C-terminal residue with aberrant properties. Rather, the anomalous NMR behavior of W33 provides a faithful re¯ection of the anomalous molten character of the C-terminal coiled-coil as revealed by comparison of multiple crystal structures (see Figures 7 and 8, and above discussion). It will be of future interest to investigate which crystal form or subset of crystal forms best represents the ensemble of structures in solution. That 33 unique NMR spin systems are observed indicates that interconversion among structural substates is fast on the time-scale of chemical shifts (<1 ms). Symmetry-based modelling retrodicts peptide-DCoH complex Rigid-body docking of the HNF-p1w structure and transcriptional coactivator DCoH provides an opportunity to evaluate the strengths and limitations of symmetry-based modelling.34 The recent availability of a co-crystal structure35 enables evaluation of previous predictions and retrodictions based on the present structure. We ®rst discuss overall features of the HNF-1a/DCoH complex and then molecular details of the interface. As predicted,34 HNF-1a/DCoH recognition is mediated by formation of an intermolecular 4HB employing the HNF-1a mini-zipper and convex (``top'') surface of the DCoH saddle (Figure 1(a))35 (see also the Supplementary Material). Such binding utilizes corresponding symmetry axes. The HNF-1a dimer has exact 2-fold symmetry, whereas the DCoH tetramer is a dimer of saddle-shaped dimers with a 4HB at its interface; each protomer contributes one helix to the 4HB with approximate dihedral (222) symmetry. The interface superim-

DCoH dimer (subunits A and B from PDB code 1DCO) is shown as green ribbon. The 2-fold symmetry axes of DCoH dimer and the HNF-p1 dimer are aligned.

poses these symmetry axes. Our previous docking exercise, although employing a side-by-side model of the anti-parallel HNF-1a 4HB, nonetheless captured essential features of the intermolecular 4HB interface (see the Supplementary Material). In light of the present crystal structure, we revisit the docking problem to consider how reliably would symmetry-based docking predict the actual structure of the complex.35

Alignment of symmetry axes The importance of symmetry in HNF-1a/DCoH recognition has long been recognized. A previous model of the HNF-1a dimer as a parallel 4HB33 thus posed a structural dilemma: the mismatch of symmetries appeared to preclude any simple mechanism of DCoH binding.25 Characterization of an anti-parallel mini-zipper, although incorrect in

651 F47 and T51 and their 2-fold-related mates (Figure 9(c)), as observed in the complex.35 The model further retrodicts contacts from Q9, A15 and S19 in HNF-p1 to L55, T51-R52, and L55 in DCoH, respectively, also in accord with the co-crystal structure. Farther from the symmetry axes, however, several intermolecular interactions are not retrodicted immediately. These include S6-E58, Q7-R45, L8-E58, E11-R45, E18-R52, and S19-K59. This limitation is due to a combination of factors. (i) Rigid-body modelling neglects local induced ®t or plasticity of side-chains in either protein. DCoH residues N44, R45, R52, E58, and K59, each involved in interactions with HNF-p1, assume different side-chain conformations in the peptideDCoH complex35 relative to the DCoH homotetramer.23 Relocation of the DCoH side-chain of E58, for example, is necessary to relieve a potential steric clash with HNF-p1 residue Q7. (ii) Whereas differences in interhelical angles across the intermolecular 4HB yield negligible errors at the center of symmetry (i.e. near L12 and L12H ), progressively larger errors occur farther from the center. These comparisons suggest that in the absence of signi®cant conformational changes, symmetrybased modelling provides a robust method for prediction of the overall features of a complex and some of its key contacts. Rigid-body docking is insuf®cient, however, to predict all the details of the contact surfaces. Predictions may be improved by explicit consideration of side-chain electrostatic and functionalities. Inspection of electrostatic surfaces in the present case strongly suggests the possibility of the observed ionic interactions (such as E11-R45 and E18-R52)35 with modest local changes in side-chain con®guration. Comparison of HNF-1a and HNF-1b a b HNF-1a and HNF-1b belong to a family of homo- and heterodimeric transcription factors regulating expression of many genes.15,22,62 Each binds to speci®c DNA sites as a dimer and forms heterodimers in vitro and in vivo. Alignment of HNF-1a and HNF-1b sequences is shown in Figure 3(a). Diabetes-related mutational sites L12 and G20 are invariant (highlighted in red). In HNF-1b positions 21 and 25 contain valine residues in place of L21 and A25 in HNF-1a domain (brackets, lower panel of Figure 3). The paired valine residues in HNF-1b presumably function as compensating substitutions to ®ll the volume occupied in the present structure by adjoining L21-A25 side-chains. Molecular modelling of L21G (red) and L25G (pink) creates a crevice, as depicted on the left side of Figure 3(b). In the crystal structure, this crevice is ef®ciently ®lled by the close-packing of side-chains L21 and A25 (right side of Figure 3(b)). Given the conservation of the remaining residues lining the HNF-1b's putative DCoH-binding surface, we expect that an homologous complex would indeed be formed. In HNF-1b, position 18 has a serine residue in place of the glutamic acid residue in HNF-1a (asterisk in

its details, resolved this incongruity and led to correct positioning of HNF-1a atop the DCoH saddle.34 In this model, as in the co-crystal structure (Figure 1(a)),35 DCoH recognition is mediated by HNF-p1w helices 1 and 1H , whereas helices 2 and 2H are distal to the interface. The model correctly de®ned the relative orientations of individual a-helices in the intermolecular 4HB (Figure 9(a) and (b)), which differ from that in the DCoH homotetramer.23 The above features are retained on docking of the present crystal structure. Signi®cantly, the improved resolution of helical phases makes possible retrodiction of possible side-chain contacts. Fortuitously, the length of a-helix 1 in HNF-p1w is the same as those of contact helices in the DCoH 4HB (15 residues). Formation of the HNF/DCoH 4HB is predicted to bury a total surface area of Ê 1820 A2. These values are similar to those observed in the co-crystal structure, wherein a total surface Ê area of 1960 A2 is buried.35 The rmsd of supera posed C atoms of helix-1 and helix-1H in HNF-p1w and equivalent helices in the DCoH tetramer is Ê 1.1 A. Symmetry-based docking of the present crystal structure thus yields the correct overall features of the complex: N-terminal helices (1 and 1H ) are ``sandwiched'' between C-terminal helices (2 and 2H ) of the HNF-p1w dimer and a pair of DCoH helices atop the saddle resulting in a six-helix bundle. An alternative possible mode of recognition employing HNF-1a helices 2 and 2H was evaluated as a control. An intermolecular 4HB may be obtained readily by inversion of the HNF-1a domain atop the saddle. Such an ``upside-down'' model in fact yields helical orientations whose symmetry is similar to that of the DCoH homotetramer. Because a-helices 2 and 2H are shorter than a-helices 1 and 1H (eight versus 15 residues), however, this alternative model exhibits a 32 % Ê reduction in buried surface area (to 1135 A2) In addition, the side-chains exposed on the surface of helices 2 and 2H are less compatible (with respect to polarity and charge) with the juxtaposed surface of the DCoH saddle than are the side-chains at the surface of the mini-zipper. Helices 1 and 1H in the present crystal structure are longer (by two residues) than in the peptide-DCoH complex, wherein residues 1-6 assume a different conformation. In the model, residues 1-5 of HNF-p1w exhibit a steric clash with DCoH. Because these residues are ¯exible in solution, the potential clash could be avoided readily. Retrodicted side-chain environments The side-chains on the mini-zipper's surface nearest to the HNF-1a dimer axis are L12 and L12H , a site of diabetes-related mutation. Alignment of HNF-1a- and DCoH symmetry axes automatically positions the methyl groups of L12 and L12H within a hydrophobic pocket formed by DCoH residues

652 Figure 3(a), lower panel). E18 is not involved in interactions between protomers, suggesting that this subsitution is neutral with respect to dimerization. However, because the E18 side-chain carboxylate group forms an ionic interaction with R52 of DCoH,35 it is possible that the presence of S18 in HNF-1b would weaken binding to DCoH. To our knowledge, binding of HNF-1b or the HNF-1a/ HNF-1b heterodimer to DCoH has not been demonstrated. Environment of clinical mutation sites I27L polymorphism The substitution I27L (highlighted in green in Figure 3(a), upper panel) is a common polymorphism in diabetic and non-diabetic populations unassociated with MODY.2 The I27 side-chain is exposed on the surface of helix 2; its interactions differ in detail between the present structure and the peptide-DCoH co-crystal structure (see above). Surprisingly, this polymorphism has been shown recently to be an independent correlative determinant of insulin sensitivity due to hepatic or peripheral insulin-resistance.63 It is not known whether the mutation alters the regulation of glucose metabolism directly or exists in linkage disequilibrium with another polymorphic gene regulating metabolism. L12H MODY mutation L12 is involved in van der Waal's interactions with symmetry-related L12H and L16H side-chains and projects to the surface of the mini-zipper (Figures 2 and 10). The side-chain thus contributes to both the stability and functional surface of the dimer. The side-chain is partially buried upon dimerization; in the extracted monomer, the fractional exposed surface is 0.55, whereas in the dimer it is 0.26 (a complete set of residue-speci®c accessibilities is provided in the Supplementry Material). L12 is invariant among mammalian HNF-1a and HNF-1b sequences (Figure 3(a)). Molecular modelling suggests that substitutions L12G or L12A would result in signi®cant packing defects Ê (cavities of respective volumes 20 and 15 A3). MODY-associated mutation L12H effects a signi®cant reduction in thermodynamic stability (ÁÁG value 3.7(Æ0.3) kcal/mol; Table 2)34 and accordingly weakens dimerization. L12 makes buried contacts with dimer-related residues of HNF-p1 and the DCoH dimer in peptide-DCoH complex.35 Consistent with this location, L12H disrupts binding of HNF-1a to DNA and DCoH.35 Overexpression of the variant intact protein restores activation of a reporter gene to native levels.8 Crystals of an L12H analogue of HNF-p1w could not be obtained; however, the analogue's NMR spectrum is nonetheless similar to that of the native dimer. Although isotope-assisted NMR studies of the L12H analogue were not performed, overall

similarities in chemical shifts and NOEs suggest that a native-like fold is maintained. To explore possible structural consequences of the L12H substitution and their implications for DCoH recognition, an homology model was constructed based on the native crystal structure. The modelling procedure employed the distance-geometry protocol of Havel & Snow,64 wherein NOEs were simulated based on the crystal structure (see Materials and Methods). (Restraint information and statistical parameters are provided as Supplementary Material.) A consistent DG/SA model was obtained, suggesting that the adjoining H12 side-chains are accommodated readily in the mini-zipper interface with only local conformational adjustments. The overall fold and structure of the variant mini-zipper are shown in Figure 10(c) and (d). Although L12 has been described as a core side-chain, the methyl resonances in fact contribute to the ¯at hydrophobic surface of the native dimer (Figure 10(a) and (b)). The L12H model predicts a striking remodelling of this surface in which the contiguous imidazole rings give rise to a weakly polar protuberance (Figure 10(e)). Exposure of the titratable Ne edge of the imidazole ring to solvent is supported by the robustness of the fold to low pH. G20R MODY mutation G20 lies in a non-canonical turn (Figure 1(b)) and appears to direct the relative orientations of helices in the peptide's ``active'' conformation. Its main-chain atoms are hyperexposed in both an extracted protomer and actual dimer with a fractional exposed surface of 0.64. Although the pattern of torsion angles in the turn differs from those of classical turns, a similar pattern is observed in helix-turn-helix motif of the arc repressor (PDB code 1BDT).65 The structures are otherwise unrelated. MODY-associated substitution G20R is associated with a profound thermodynamic destabilization (Table 2; and see Hua et al.34) and loss of architectural speci®city. Although the variant dimer retains near-native helix content as inferred from CD studies, a combination of features (nontwo-state unfolding, binding of ANS, loss of chemical-shift dispersion with conformational broadening) indicate that the variant dimer forms a molten globule. We speculate that local frustration of the sharp turn precludes ef®cient packing of the C-terminal coiled-coil against the mini-zipper. A possible mechanism of frustration is suggested by the crystal structure: given the present backbone torsion angles at residues 19 and 20, any L-amino acid substitution at position 20 would not be sterically favorable. The distance between the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue 19 (ith position) and the Cb of residue 20 (position i  1) Ê would be less than 2.4 A, which predicts a steric clash; by contrast D-amino acids should be accommodated readily. The proposed mechanism predicts that the G20R perturbation is not side-chain speci®c; i.e. G20A and other analogues would exhi-

bit similar instabilities. It is unclear why the putative steric clash cannot be relieved by local conformational adjustments to give an altered but architecturally speci®c structure. Concluding remarks The dimerization domain of HNF-1a provides an opportunity to compare structures at high resolution in multiple crystallographic environments.

The structure consists of a novel intertwined fourhelix bundle with non-canonical turn. Multiple structural comparisons suggest strongly that the domain consists of a rigid element, an N-terminal anti-parallel mini-zipper, and a plastic element, the C-terminal coiled-coil. Two types of plasticity are observed. (i) The immediate N and C-terminal segments can be a-helical or disordered depending on packing environment. Corresponding ¯exibility in solution has been demonstrated by 1H-NMR

654 motional narrowing, chemical-shift patterns, selected main-chain coupling constants and, in the case of W33, multiple inter-residue NOEs inconsistent with a single unqiue structure. (ii) Plasticity exists at the interface between the mini-zipper and the overlying C-terminal a-helices leading to different patterns of side-chain packing. Although the non-canonical turn and intertwined topology are maintained consistently, striking differences occur in possible inter-helical angles. The collection of HNF-p1 crystal structures is reminiscent of insulin, whose many high-resolution crystal structures likewise exhibit a combination of invariant and plastic features.66,67 The most divergent HNF-1a structure is that observed in a speci®c complex with DCoH. Because recognition is mediated by the invariant mini-zipper and the molten C-terminal coiled-coil, such induced ®t appears to involve a transmission of conformation change. Transmission of conformational change among crystal structures of insulin has been highlighted by the late D. C. Hodgkin and colleagues68 and, as in the HNF-1a/DCoH complex, may facilitate receptor binding.69 The present study suggests new directions for future study. First, given the collection of equivalent crystal structures, which subset of conformations best represents the structure in solution? Although the present isotope-edited studies verify the overall intertwined topology and phase of the mini-zipper, more detailed heteronuclear NMR studies of structure and dynamics will be required to assess the inter-helical packing scheme(s) and estimate the range of possible conformational change. Laboratory-frame approaches based on residual dipolar couplings are likely to be informative. Second, what is the role of the non-canonical turn in enabling a speci®c architecture to be obtained? The role of turns in general in 4HBs has been the subject of debate.70,71 We have suggested a speci®c structural mechanism for the invariance of glycine (G20) and predict that any L-amino acid (but not D-amino acids) at position 20 would block speci®c folding to create a novel molten globule. If so, the HNF-1a motif would provide an example of an energy landscape72 whose shape and depth depend on a particular turn orientation. Finally, what is the biological signi®cance of the domain's asymmetric plasticity? A possible clue is provided by the unexplained G31D diabetes-associated mutation. Unlike L12H and G20R, the G31D variant would seem not to affect the domain's structure, stability or interaction with DCoH.35 An intriguing possibility is that in vivo HNF-1a interacts with DCoH and with other transcriptional coactivators or co-repressors and that such (to date) uncharacterized interactions are disrupted by the G31D mutation. This possibility in turn suggests a structural model in which the plastic portion of the HNF-1a domain adopts one orientation on binding to DCoH and another conformation on binding to a putative second regulatory cofactor. Plasticity in the packing of the mini-zipper and C-terminal a-helices may thus extend the domain's repertoire

of interactions as part of a structural switch between functional states. An example of such a dynamic switch has been characterized recently in a cytoplasmic signalling pathway.73

Materials and Methods
Peptide synthesis The HNF-1a domain with MSe substitution at position 13 was prepared by solid-phase synthesis (Gryphon Sciences, Inc., South San Fransisco, CA). Sample purity was greater than 98 % as estimated by analytical reversephase HPLC. Fidelity of synthesis was veri®ed by ion-spray mass spectrometery. The dimeric status of the peptide was veri®ed by analytical gel-®ltration chromatography. Crystallization and X-ray data collection The peptide was crystallized by the hanging drop/ vapor diffusion method. The peptide was made 3 mM in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT. Crystals were grown at 4  C by mixing equal volumes of peptide solution (3 ml) and reservoir solution (3 ml) containing 20 % (v/v) methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mM DTT. Crystals mounted on nylon loops were transferred to stabilization buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 % MPD or 30 % PEG400) and ¯ashfrozen in liquid nitrogen before data collection at 100 K. X-ray data were collected at beamline 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) data sets were collected at three wavelengths: remote (lr), peak (lp), and at the inversion point (li) of selenium atom (Table 1). The crystals belong to orthorhombic space Ê Ê group P21212 with a  28.42 A, b  42.19 A, and Ê c  42.43 A. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 23 % (v/v). Raw data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package.74 Data collection statistics are presented in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The two selenium positions corresponding to two independent molecules (molecules 1 and 2) in the asymmetric unit were determined by computing anomalous and dispersive- difference Patterson maps using program CNS.75 Heavy-atom positions were re®ned against MAD data with remote wavelength as reference using data Ê between 40 and 3.0 A resolution. Further density modi®Ê cation and phase extension to 2.5 A resolution using CNS yielded a high-quality MAD-phased electron density map. It was possible to trace the two helices in molecule 1 and one helix in molecule 2. A polyalanine model was constructed for molecule 1 and for one helix in molecule 2 using program O76 and re®ned using data collected at remote wavelength (lr). Structure re®nement was done using CNS. Overall anisotropic scale factors and a bulk solvent corrections were applied and a maximum likelihood amplitude-based target function were employed.77 Simulated-annealing (SA) torsion-angle re®nement78 and individual B-factor re®nement was performed as implemented in CNS. Several rounds of alternate SA re®nement and model rebuilding were performed with gradual increments in the data resolution. Each residue in molecule 1 was seen in the electron density map, whereas helix 2 in molecule 2 was

An Intertwined Four-helix Bundle in HNF-1 poorly de®ned and built residue-by-residue in iterative re®nement cycles. Water molecules that are at a potential hydrogen bonding distance from the protein or another water molecule were added in ®nal rounds of re®nement. SA omit maps were computed by omitting two residues at a time for both molecules 1 and 2, and the model rebuilt. In molecule 2 the ®rst two N-terminal residues and the last three C-terminal residues are not seen in the map and are considered disordered. The ®nal model consists of molecule 1 (33 residues), molecule 2 (28 residues), and 55 water molecules. The structure was re®ned to a ®nal crystallographic R of 23.1 % using F > 3 Ê sF between 40 and 1.7 A resolution. The Rfree for the re®ned model was 24.5 %. Some of the ®nal re®nement statistics are given in Table 1. Average B-factors for molÊ ecule 1, molecule 2, and water molecules are 15.9 A2, Ê Ê 23.0 A2, and 28.1 A2, respectively. The ®nal structure was validated using PROCHECK.79 HNF-DCoH model building The crystal structure of HNF-p1w was used to dock against the crystal structure of the DCoH dimer (subunits A and B of PDB code 1DCO) using the InsightII molecular graphics package (MSI, Inc.). The 2-fold axis of HNF-p1w was aligned on the 2-fold axis of DCoH, superposing dimer-related anti-parallel helices of HNFp1 and the equivalent helices (without considering the helix direction) in the DCoH tetramer (subunits C and D). Superposition employed sheer rotation about the aligned axis (Figure 9(a)). This procedure results in a model for the HNF-p1w/DCoH complex with a 4HB interface. The model predicts different relative helical orientations for this 4HB compared to the DCoH tetramer: the direction of the helices in HNF-p1w dimer are reversed compared to the helices in DCoH tetramer (Figure 9(b)) in accord with modelling studies by Hua et al.34 and the co-crystal structure.35 Cavity volumes were computed using the program surfnet.80 Expression and labeling of HNF-1a peptide a A DNA segment encoding HNF-p1w was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the human HNF-1a cDNA as template. The PCR product was cloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of plasmid pMW1 previously employed to express phage l N peptides.81 The HNF-1a peptide was expressed as a thrombincleavable fusion protein with staphylococcal nuclease as described.82 The expressed protein contained an N-terminal hexa-His tag to enable af®nity puri®cation. Biosynthetic 13C labeling was accomplished in an overexpressing strain of Escherichia coli by growth in M9 minimal medium containing [13C]glucose as sole carbon source. The biosynthetic peptide contained 36 residues, including three non-native N-terminal residues (GSE); the C terminus was not amidated. Isotope-assisted NMR studies The following spectra were obtained for the 13Clabeled peptide homodimer: 13C-1H HSQC, 13C-1H 2D HSQC-TOCSY (mixing time of 45 ms), 13C-1H 3D HCCH-TOCSY, 13C-1H 3D NOESY-HSQC (mixing time of 250 ms). Complete assignments were obtained. To evaluate intermolecular NOEs, an equimolar mixture of the synthetic peptide HNF-p1w and the labeled biosynthetic peptide was prepared. The following spectra were

655
obtained for the equilibrium mixture: 13C-1H HSQC, 13 C-1H 2D HSQC-TOCSY (mixing time of 45 ms), and 13 C-1H intermolecular 2D NOESY.83 Circular dichroism Spectra were obtained using an Aviv spectropolarimeter equipped with thermister temperature control. Samples were placed in a 1 mm path-length quartz cuvette. Peptide concentrations in the presence of MPD were corrected for volume change of solvent miscibility. The buffer solutions corresponded to crystallization conditions. L12H homology modelling A molecular model of the L12H variant dimer was constructed using the DG/SA protocol as described:64 1212 homology distance restraints were imposed, supplemented by one key H12-speci®c NOE (H12-L16H , presumed to be inter-protomeric). In brief, inter-proton distances were inferred from the crystal structure (using the HBUILD facility in InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.)) for residues 5-33, excepting the side-chain of residue 12; no restraint was included for residues 1-4 or 1H -4H in light of NMR evidence of ¯exibility. Distance bounds were assigned to conventional NMR ranges (i.e. strong Ê Ê Ê (<2.7 A), medium (<3.4 A) or weak (<5 A)) based on inferred values in the crystal structure. a-Helix-related hydrogen bonds were imposed by pairs of distance restraints (between the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue Ê i and the amide proton of residue i  4 (2.3-2.6 A) and between the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue i and the Ê amide nitrogen atom of residue i  4 (2.7-3.3 A)) for residues 10-19 and 26-30. Dihedral restraints on main-chain f values were assumed for helical residues (residues 619 and 22-30; f  À 65(Æ40)  ); both f and c values were imposed for G20 and G20H (f  70(Æ40)  and c  À 150(Æ40)  ); and side-chain w1 and w2 dihedral angles were imposed for residues 12 and 13 (Æ40  of the value in the present crystal structure). The main-chain rmsd between the present structure and the L12H model Ê (residues 5-28 and 5H -28H ) is 1.1 A. No signi®cant restraint violation is observed in the ®nal homology ensemble (see the Supplementary Material, where a summary of restraint information is provided). Atomic coordinates Atomic coordinates (1JB6) and X-ray data (Y1JB6Sp) have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank..
