The enzyme trypanothione reductase has been identified as a prime target for the rational design of inhibitors which may have clinical use in the treatment of tropical diseases caused by the genera Trypanosoma and Leishmania.To aid the design or identification of new inhibitors of this enzyme we have elucidated the structural detail of a trypanothione reductase complexed with one of the naturally occurring substrates, Ilr-glutathionylspermidinedisulphide, by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods at 0.28-nm resolution. The model for the Crithidia fasciculata enzyme-substrate complex has an R-factor of 14.8% and root-mean-square deviations of 0.0015 nm and 3.3" on bond lengths and angles respectively. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions between the enzyme and substrate are dominated by the amino acid side chains. The substrate binds in a rigid active site such that one glutathione moiety is in a V-shape, the other in an extended conformation. One spermidine moiety binds closely to a hydrophobic patch in the active site formed by a tryptophan and a methionine. Distances between the methionine S6 and the terminal N of this spermidine suggest that a hydrogen bond may supplement the hydrophobic interactions in this part of the active site.

Parasitic diseases continue to devastate both the physical health and material wealth of people living in many tropical countries. Current chemotherapy is frequently unsatisfactory with low efficacy, drug toxicity and drug resistance presenting some of the major problems (Goodwin, 1987). Basic research has recently been devoted towards the identification of suitable metabolic pathways that can potentially be exploited by rational drug design (Hol, 1986; Fairlamb, 1989). In the case of trypanosomes and leishmania, causative agents of African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease and cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, the discovery of trypanothione [iV,P-bis(glutathionyl)spennidine, T(SH), ; Fairlamb et al., 1985) has attracted attention. This metabolite is unique and essential to these parasites and suggests a viable target for chemotherapeutic attack. This is because trypanothione and its metabolic precursor (I" -glutathionylspermidine ; GspdSH) appear to have taken over many of the protective anti-oxidant functions that in mammalian cells are mediated by the sulphydryl group of glutathione (L-y-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine; GSH). The diverse roles of the glutathionylCorrespondence to W. N. Hunter, Department of Chemistry, University of Manchester, Oxford Rd, Manchester, England M13 9PL Far: 061 275 4598.

spermidine conjugates has been reviewed elsewhere (Fairlamb and Cerami, 1992). In the course of these anti-oxidant functions, GSH and T(SH), are oxidised to their respective disulphides [(GS), and T(S),; Fig. 11, with the products being rapidly reduced by NADPH via their cognate flavoenzymes, glutathione reductase in the mammalian host and trypanothione reductase in the parasite (Shames et al., 1986). Trypanothione reductases and mammalian glutathione reductases share approximately 40% sequence similarity and the catalytically important residues are conserved (AboagyeKwarteng et al., 1993 ;Fairlamb and Cerami, 1992). The proteins are both active as homodimers of subunit mass around 52 kDa, contain a non-covalently bound FAD and use NADPH to provide a reducing equivalent in the enzyme mechanism (Ghisla and Massey, 1989). The critical difference between trypanothione reductase and mammalian glutathione reductase is that the enzymes are only capable of processing their cognate substrates (Henderson et al., 1987). Thus, mammalian glutathione reductase will not catalyse the reduction of trypanothione disulphide [T(S),] to T(SH), or N-glutathionylspermidine disulphide [(GspdS),] to GspdSH at any significant rate ; neither will trypanothione reductase process (GS), to GSH. The exclusive specificity of these enzymes suggests that it may be possible to find inhibitors of trypanothione reductase that would not affect the mammalian host glutathione reductase such that, if the trypanosomal enzyme were selectively disabled then the parasites would succumb to oxidative stress. Schulz and co-workers have dissected, in considerable detail, the structurelactivity relationships of human glutathione reductase (Janes and Schulz, 1991; Karplus et al., 1989; Karplus and Schulz 1987, 1989).

We decided to refine the structure completely and so, prior to interpretation of the density, the current native model was refined against the data from the substrate-bound crystal using the X-PLOR package (Briinger, 1990). A heatinglslow cooling step, up to 15OO0C,was first carried out followed by several cycles of conventional positional refinement applying restraints on non-crystallographic symmetry. An overall temperature factor of 0.2 nm2 was applied. The R-factor, defined as ZIF,-F,IIZIF,I, was 20.6% for all data between 0.80.28 nm. Density maps were then calculated using the coefficients 2F0-Fc, acdc and F,-F,, acalc. electron density The was consistent with two W-glutathionylspermidine disulphide molecules located in each active site of the enzyme. X-PLOR was again used for further cycles of refinement interspersed with graphics fitting using FRODO (Jones, 1978; P. R. Evans, personal communication). The substrates were included in the model and restraints on non-crystallographic symmetry released. Solvent molecules, all treated as oxygen atoms of water, were progressively added at each stage of map inspection and included in subsequent refinement calculations. Several solvent molecules displayed isotropic thermal parameters greater than 0.5 nm'. These were in general deleted but we noted 16 which, despite such a high B value, were in well defined density and on this basis they were retained. Individual atomic temperature factors were also included in the refinement but not allowed to drop below 0.03 nm2. The refinement was terminated with a crystallographic R-factor of 14.8% for the 32393 reflections with F, > OF,between the limits of 0.8-0.28 nm resolution. cellent. It is worthy of note that the residues comprising the disulphide substrate binding site of trypanothione reductase are some of the most ordered in the structure (see below). In the final 2F,,-F,, electron density map (where F, and F, represent the observed and calculated structure factors respectively, aCdc phase calculated from the molecular mothe del) there is continuous density at the la level for all main chain atoms. Fig. 2 shows the disulphide substrate in one of the binding sites with the associated electron density of an omit map. The model contains one difference from the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence (Aboagye-Kwarteng et al., 1993). This is located at position 126 where a tryptophan replaces a phenylalanine. The decision to place a tryptophan in this position was based on the evidence presented by the electron and difference density maps. A Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968) indicates 13 violations. Three of these are at either the N or Cterminal regions. Particular residues of note are Tyr4.5, Ala47, Ser315, Arg331 and Ser433 which display the same strained conformations in both subunits. These latter residues are well defined, in tight loops and their conformations are stabilised by hydrogen bonds to residues also in the loop.

Overall structure of trypanothione reductase and location of the disulphide substrate binding site
A diagram of the trypanothione reductase dimer showing the domain organisation and location of the substrates in the two active sites is presented in Fig. 3. The fold and domain structures are similar to that of human glutathione reductase at a level commensurate with the sequence similarity of approximately 40% (Kuriyan et al., 1991 ; Hunter et al., 1992). Each trypanothione reductase monomer contains four domains. Domains I and 1 bind FAD and NADPH respectively 1 and display `Rossmann' folds (Rao and Rossmann, 1973). Domain I11 has been referred to previously as the central domain (Karplus and Schulz, 1987) and domain IV forms the interface with the partner subunit. The secondary structure of the enzyme comprises approximately 30% a-helices, 30% P-sheet and 40% in a variety of other conformations. The functional dimer contains two disulphide substrate binding sites. Each is located in a cleft constructed by contributions from domains I and I11 from one subunit and domain IV from the other subunit (Fig. 4). The cleft is approximately 2.0 nm long by 1.5 nm wide and 1.5 nm deep. It is lined on one side by three helices and on the other side by a small section of residues in an extended conformation, two short helical segments and, at the periphery, the edge of a section of j3sheet. The floor of the active site is formed by a helical segment on which is located the redox active disulphide formed by Cys52 and Cys57.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystallography The crystal structure is isomorphous with the native structure (Hunter et al., 1992) and has been fully refined (see Materials and Methods). The final model comprises a protein dimer (residues 1A-487A for the first subunit, 2B-487B for the second, 7418 non-hydrogen atoms with an average isotropic thermal parameter, B,, = 0.13 nm2) plus two FAD molecules (106 atoms, B,, = 0.05 nm'), four W-glutathionylspermidine molecules (116 atoms, B., = 0.47 nm2), two NADP molecules (96 atoms, B,, = 0.48 nm2) and 400 solvent molecules treated as oxygen atoms. The B values for solvent positions ranged over 0.03-0.64 nm2 with B , = 0.28 nm'. The final model has root-mean-square (r.m.s.) values on bond lengths and angles of 0.0015 nm and 3.3" respectively. For dihedral angles the r.m.s. is 25.8'. The presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit provides an internal check on the structure and we observe very similar results, commensurate W-Glutathionylspermidinedisulphide binding with the level of accuracy of this structure, for each active The amino acid segments that construct the trypanothione site interacting with the substrate.

midine segments and chain identifier A or B according to which active site they bind. The 23 amino acid residues that have been identified as playing a role in directly binding the disulphide substrate, either by hydrogen bonding or van der Waals interactions or both, are listed in Tables 2 and 3. We note that there are no major rearrangements of residues when comparing the structures of the native enzyme refined at 0.26-nm resolution with the enzyme-[GspdS], complex. The presence of the

acidic residues, Glul8, Glu466' and Glu467'; help to provide an overall negative charge in the active site. This serves to compensate for the positively charged substrates utilised by trypanothione reductase (Fig. 1). Given the similarities between (GS), and (GspdS), with their conserved y-glutamylcysteinyl moieties and the similarities in certain sections of the active sites of glutathione reductase and trypanothione reductase, it is not surprising that we observe similar conformations in the two systems. In an analogous fashion to (GS), (Karplus and Schulz, 1989), one I -glutathionylspermidine (Gspd is used to signify the V glutathionylspermidine component of the dimeric substrate) binds with the yGlu-Cys-Gly moiety in a V-shape. yGlu-I interacts mainly with domain I 1 and IV residues whereas 1 the Cys-I, Gly-I and Spd-I components interact mainly with domain I residues. The spermidine component fits into a

hydrophobic niche formed at Trp21 and Metll3. The second Gspd binds in an extended mode. The yGlu-I1 segment interacts with domain IV residues whereas the Cys-11, Gly-11, Spd-I1 portions only contact residues belonging to domain 1. The spermidine moiety flails out across one of the a-helical sections of this FAD binding domain (Figs 4 and 5). Specific contacts that may represent hydrogen bonds formed between the substrate and the enzyme are detailed in Table 1. The two binding sites have been refined independently and for each a best fit, between substrate and density, has been achieved. This has resulted in minor differences between the active sites, particularly in the solvent structure, which are commensurate with the resolution of our data. There are 12 enzyme residues implicated in hydrogen bond interactions when both site A and B are considered. Of particular interest are the residues Glu18, Serl09 and Metll3. Glu18 is held in position by a hydrogen bond from Asn22 and able to accept another hydrogen bond from the amide linking Gly-I and Spd-I. Serl09, in site B, appears to form a hydrogen bond with N4 of Spd-11. The occurrence of hydrogen bonds in proteins that involve a sulphur atom has recently been surveyed (Gregoret et al., 1991). It has been noted that hydrogen bonding to the Sy of methionines is not particularly common. In our structure the two distances observed between N8 of Spd-I and Sy of Met113 are 0.29 nm and 0.36 nm in sites A and B, respectively. These distances are, given the accuracy of this structure, comparable to the distance of 0.34 nm observed for N-H-S hydrogen bonding interactions on the basis of small molecule crystal structures (Hamilton and Ibers, 1968). Met113 also partakes in van der Waals interactions with the substrate (see below). Solvent-mediated linkages formed between substrate and enzyme also contribute significantly to stabilising the complex. This is particularly evident at the Glu-I binding sites (Table 2). The N4 atom of Spd-I is directed away from the hydrophobic cleft formed at Trp21 and Met113 and points out toward bulk solvent. In site B, N4 Spd-I is 0.37 nm from So1331 which in turn is 0.37 nm and 0.34 nm from 061 of Asn22 and Oe1 of Glul8 respectively. The terminal amino group of Spd-I1 is free to interact with solvent and in the B active site such an association is indeed observed. In terms of van der Waals interactions, there are 21 residues that have contacts of 0.4 nm or less with the substrate

that do not represent hydrogen bonds (Table 3). Of these, 18 make single or multiple contacts in the A site and 19 in the B site. Residues of note with respect to van der Waals interactions with the substrate are the aromatics Trp21, Phe396' and His461'. In particular, Trp21 stacks over the Spd-I segment of the substrate helping to produce the most contacts between enzyme and substrate in one corner of the active site (Fig. 5). Most of the contacts involve the amino acid side chains although some of the main-chain atoms of Serl4, Leul7, Serl09, Gly112, Pro398', Pro462', and Ser464' interact in this manner. The conformations of the NADP molecules that bind to trypanothione reductase are similar to those observed in other oxidoreductase systems (Karplus and Schulz, 1989; Mattevi et al., 1992). This detail will be presented elsewhere.

A rigid active site, a flexible substrate
The disulphide substrate binding site residues are amongst the most ordered in the enzyme structure with an average thermal parameter of 0.11 nm2 for all atoms of those 23 residues in the unliganded enzyme that we have identified as being involved in the binding. In the complex with (GspdS), the average thermal parameter is 0.10 nm'. Also, there are no major alterations in side-chain conformations, when comparing native and liganded enzyme. Taken together, these two observations suggest that the active site is fairly rigid. The trypanothione reductase active site is constructed from a scaffold of secondary structure, mostly ahelices, which must help to promote rigidity. The constituents of the active site involve bulky aromatic residues and a number of short side-chain residues. The residues with longer side chains are observed to interact with other residues to stabilise specific orientations. So, Glu18 is held by a hydrogen bond with Asn22, Trp21 N E hydrogen bonds with Oyl ~ of Thrll7, Glu466' has hydrogen bonds with His461' N61 and the amide of Thr463` and Glu477` has a hydrogen bonding contact with Oy of Ser394`. In active site B, the latter is a direct hydrogen bond, in active site A it is solvent-mediated. Hydrophobic interactions also stabilise certain side-chain conformations. Met113 is stacked below Trp21 and has the methyl group directed into a hydrophobic core formed by Leul7, Leu33 and Phell4. This helps to orient the S6 atom for interaction with the N8 primary amine of Spd-I. The ali-

NMR studies on the cyclic peptide trypanothione (Henderson et al., 1990) and glutathione disulphide (Rabenstein and Keire, 1989) indicate a considerable degree of flexibility. This conformational freedom is aIso likely to apply to the acyclic N-glutathionylspennidine disulphide. Once in the active site, however, the conformational freedom will be restricted by interactions with the enzyme. This enzyme-substrate complex is clearly not an example of the lock-and-key

mechanism of binding (Fersht, 1985). The term `induced fit' is in general used to denote conformational change on the part of the enzyme. In the present study it is the substrate that undergoes induced fit. Although similar to the `zipper' scenario presented by Burgen et al. (1975), the trypanothione reductase substrate interactions may thus be classed as what we term mould-and-melt fit. The rigid active site presents a cavity or mould of defined shape, with chemical properties varying according to the locality on the mould. The flexible or molten substrate molecule diffuses into the mould and is

pressured by non-covalent interactions into the correct orientation and specific conformation for binding to occur and subsequently catalysis. Only a small quantity of energy would be expended to alter the substrate conformation given the flexibility of the spermidine adducts involved. We have calculated solvent-accessible areas, using a solvent probe radius of 0.14nm, for the substrate in isolation and when complexed with trypanothione reductase (Table 4). Although we do not know the precise conformation of the uncomplexed (GspdS),, by treating it in isolation from the enzyme we gain some insight into what area of the substrate is utilised in the interactions with trypanothione reductase. The results show that approximately 66% of the substrate area becomes buried when the enzyme-(GspdS), complex is formed. This suggests an important role of the hydrophobic part of the active site in stabilising the complex. In energy terms the results presented in Table 4 suggest that the hydrophobicity component of binding approximates to 84 k mol-' J (20 kcal mol-'; Chothia and Janin, 1975). The proportion of buried surface area on complex formation is not uniform over the substrate molecule but observed to vary from residue to residue. In general, Gspd-I is more buried than Gspd-11. The largest decrease in surface accessibility (95 %) occurs at CysI, the smallest decrease at Spd-11. Indeed, the Spd-I portion of the substrate is significantly more buried than is the SpdI1 component. The stacking of Trp21 over Spd-I serves to enhance the protection of aliphatic methylene groups from solvent. Of the 23 residues listed in Tables 2 and 3 which interact directly with the substrate, only Gly112 is not conserved in the other trypanothione reductases (Aboagye-Kwarteng et al., 1993). In trypanothione reductase from T. cruzi this position contains an aspartate (Sullivan and Walsh, 1991), in T. congolense trypanothione reductase a glutamate (Shames et al., 1988). The C. fusciculutu trypanothione-reductase-(GspdS), complex structure implicates the Glyll2 Ca in contacting the spermidine component (Spd-11) of the substrate in binding site B (Table 3). The orientation of the peptide main chain suggests that a side chain would be directed away from the substrate. It is, however, possible that slight rearrangements of either the aspartate or glutamate side chains and the SpdI1 section of (GspdS), could facilitate a direct interaction between the oppositely charged groups in other trypanothione reductase molecules. In molecular modelling studies on T. congolense trypanothione reductase such an interaction in-

Atoms comprising the three domains that form the active sites of (a) trypanothione reductase and (b) human glutathione reductase have been depicted as space-filled spheres. Atoms comprising aspartates and glutamates are colored red, basic arginines, histidines and lysines are colored dark blue and all other enzyme atoms are white. The cognate substrates for trypanothione reductase and glutathione reductase are shown in light blue and yellow with the latter color being used to identify the CysI and Cys-II residues. The direction of viewing is similar to that employed in Figs 3-5.

74 volving a glutamic acid interacting with the spermidine portion of (TS), was postulated by Murgolo et al. (1991). We now have access to X-ray-grade crystals of recombinant trypanothione reductase and plan to investigate this further. Comparison with (GS)2 binding to glutathione reductase Based on the structure of the active site of native trypanothione reductase, we and others (Hunter et al., 1992; Kuriyan et al., 1991) have put forward explanations for the differing substrate specificities of human glutathione reductase and trypanothione reductase. Our study of the complex with N1glutathionylspennidine disulphide now provides direct evidence concerning trypanothione reductase enzyme specificity. Of particular note with respect to the differing substrate specificities of human glutathione reductase and trypanothione reductase are the size and charge of the active-site cleft and specific interactions involving residues on one side of the active site. It has been shown previously that the trypanothione reductase active site is more open than the glutathione reductase active site and that the charges were different (Kuriyan et al., 1991; Hunter et al., 1992). The more open trypanothione reductase active site is required for the larger substrate. We now confirm that in trypanothione reductase the charge of all residues interacting with (GspdS), is overall negative, whilst in glutathione reductase it is positive. This difference in charge is explained by the electrostatic requirements of the cognate substrates. A positive charge accompanies the trypanothione reductase substrates, a negative charge for (GS), engendering charge complementarity between enzymes and cognate substrates. A comparison between our trypanothione reductase and human glutathione reductase shows that there are six nonconservative amino acid differences in the residues involved in the interaction with substrate. In the format trypanothione reductase residue/glutathione reductase residue these are Glul8/Ala34, Trp211Arg37, Asn22/Arg38, Ser109/Ile113, Metll3/Asnl17 and Ala343/Arg347. The first five differences all occur on one side of the active site (Fig. 5) and are key to the question of the differential specificity of trypanothione reductase and human glutathione reductase. Trypanothione reductase uses Asn22 to stabilise a conformation of Glu18 that then, in turn, accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide linking Gly-I and Spd-I. Asn22 is also positioned to interact with the substrate through a solvent-mediated linkage as observed in site B. Glu18 places a negative charge in the active site. Trp21 caps this portion of the active site and, together with Metll3, forms a hydrophobic patch to bind the Spd-I residue. Met113 offers a hydrogen bond accepter and polarizable sulphur atom together with van der Waals interactions to produce a significant component to the binding of Spd-I. The carbonyl group of Serl09 is able to accept a hydrogen bond of length 0.32 nm from N4 of Spd-I1 in site B. Human glutathione reductase presents the positive Arg37 and Arg38 to repulse the positively charged trypanothione reductase substrates. In addition, the presence of Asnll7 with the arginines produces a hydrophilic patch in the active site. Asnll7 would not provide a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties, as does a methionine (Gellman, 1991), to interact with Spd-I. The Ala343/Arg347 substitution merely removes another large positively charged amino acid residue from the active site of trypanothione reductase, in accordance with the structural requirements of a large positively charged substrate. Our structural results are in broad agreement with the mutational analyses carried out on recombinant glutathione reductase and trypanothione reductase (Bradley et al., 1991 ; Henderson et al., 1991; Sullivan et al., 1991; Walsh et al., 1991). The distribution of charged residues on the surface of trypanothione reductase and human glutathione reductase is quite different (Fig. 6). Trypanothione reductase has a ring of acidic residues on the exterior of one side of the disulphide substrate binding site, the side which binds the positive Spd components. This may serve to attract the respective substrates, perhaps also to pre-orient them before they slip into the cleft. In human glutathione reductase basic arginine and lysine residues are located in this area of the enzyme presumably to carry out the same function of interacting with the negatively charged glycine carboxylates of (GS),. The trypanothione-reductase-(GspdS), complex gives clues to the mode of binding of the other physiological substrate T(S),. The Spd-I component of (GspdS), appears to approximately mimic the position of the spermidine bridge of trypanothione. However, although there are clear similarities, we think that the precise detail of the trypanothione reductase/T(S), interactions would be difficult to predict given the flexibility of the substrate and the asymmetry of the spermidine bridge. This detail would be better determined experimentally. In terms of inhibitor design, we now have access to an accurate model of the trypanothione reductase active site and details about which residues are involved in substrate binding and their mode of interaction. We judge it to be useful that the targeted active site is fairly rigid and will now proceed to the study of enzyme-inhibitor complexes with the hope that we can improve on the encouraging results of previous inhibitor studies (Benson et al., 1992; Henderson et al., 1988; Jockers-Scherubl et al., 1989).
