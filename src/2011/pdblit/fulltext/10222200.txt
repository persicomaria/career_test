The X-ray crystal structures of Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 a-amylase ° 1 (TVAI) and a-amylase 2 (TVAII) have been determined at 1.6 A and ° resolution, respectively. The structures of TVAI and TVAII have 2.3 A been refined, R-factor of 0.182 ðRfree ¼ 0:206Þ and 0.179 (0.224), respectively, with good chemical geometries. Both TVAI and TVAII have four domains, N, A, B and C, and all very similar in structure. However, there are some differences in the structures between them. Domain N of TVAI interacts strongly with domains A and B, giving a spherical shape structure to the enzyme, while domain N of TVAII is isolated from the other domains, which leads to the formation of a dimer. TVAI has three bound Ca ions, whereas TVAII has only one. TVAI has eight extra loops compared to TVAII, while TVAII has two extra loops compared to TVAI. TVAI can hydrolyze substrates more efficiently than TVAII with a high molecular mass such as starch, while TVAII is much more active against cyclodextrins than TVAI and other a-amylases. A structural comparison of the active sites has clearly revealed this difference in substrate specificity.

Introduction
a-Amylase (a-1,4-D -glucan-4-glucanohydrolase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of a-D -(1,4)-glucosidic linkages in starch to release a-anomer, and has been studied in terms of structure, function and industrial use.1,2 Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 produces two a-amylases, TVAI (637 amino acid residues, Mr ¼ 71; 000 Da)3,4 and TVAII (585 amino acid residues, 67,500 Da).5,6 In addition to starch, they efficiently hydrolyze 1,4-a-D -glucosidic linkages of cyclic oligosaccharides (cyclodextrins, CDs) and pullulan with the sequence repeat of

1,4-a, 1,4-a and 1,6-a-glycosidic linkages, while most other a-amylases scarcely hydrolyze CDs and pullulan.7 We report the crystal structure of ° TVAII at 2.6 A resolution, showing that TVAII has an extra domain N composed of 121 amino acid residues at the N-terminal site, in addition to a-amylase-preserved domains A, B, and C, and that domain N is one of the driving forces in the formation of the dimer structure.8 We also report the X-ray structures of inactive mutant TVAIIs (Glu354 ! Ala or Asp325 ! Asn) complexed with b-CD (E354A/b-CD),9 methyl-b-CD (D325N/ methyl-b-CD) and maltohexose (D325N/G6),10 showing that Phe286 is an important residue for TVAII to recognize CDs, and that the binding mode of G6 as a substrate is very similar to that observed in the other a-amylase and a-amylase family enzymes.11 ­ 13 TVAI has 32% amino acid sequence homology with TVAII, as shown in Figure 1, and should have an extra domain N like TVAII, suggesting that TVAI has a similar three-dimensional structure

to TVAII. However, there are some interesting differences in substrate specificity and thermostability between them, as follows. (1) Hydrolyzing activities for starch and pullulan are much higher in TVAI than TVAII.4 (2) TVAI scarcely hydrolyzes a, b-CDs (six and seven glucose units) with a small cavity size, and can hydrolyze only g-CD (eight glucose units), while TVAII can efficiently hydrolyze a, b and g-CDs.14,15 (3) TVAI has thermostability about 10 8C higher than TVAII.3 The three-dimensional structures of TVAI and TVAII and a comparison of them are very useful in elucidating these differences in enzyme character, and may provide insights into the hydrolyzing mechanism for CDs of TVAs. We report here the ° X-ray structure of TVAI at 1.6 A resolution and the ° improved X-ray structure of TVAII at 2.3 A resolution, using Synchrotron radiation. By structural comparison, a difference in the manner of Ca2þ binding is found between TVAI and TVAII. To investigate the relationship between the bound Ca ions and thermostability of the enzyme, we also carried out a thermostability assay of TVAI and TVAII in the presence and absence of chelating reagent.

(266 ­ 320) protruding from domain A, and domain C (554 ­ 637) with a b-sandwich structure. TVAII also has four domains which are similar in structure to those of TVAI, domain N (residues 1 ­ 121), domain A (122 ­ 242 and 298­ 502), domain B (243 ­ 297) and domain C (503 ­ 585), and a bound Ca2þ newly identified in this study. The relative orientations and positions of domain A, B, and C are similar, but those of domain N are very different. In TVAI, domain N interacts with domains A and C to stabilize the enzyme structure, while in TVAII, it is isolated and interacts little with domains A and C. As previously reported, domain N of TVAII has a hydrophobic groove located between two broken b-strands, b1aNb1bN and b7aN-b7bN, where many hydrophobic residues are exposed on the molecular surface.8 TVAI also has a hydrophobic groove between b1aN-b1bN and b7aN-b7bN; however, it is not on the molecular surface but in contact with domains A and C. Extra loops in TVAI and TVAII TVAI has eight extra loops compared to TVAII, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. They are located at the N terminus, between b1A and a1A (two extra loops), between a2A and b3A, in a1B, in a3A, between b4A and a4A, and between a6aA and a6bA. Extra loops at the N terminus and in domain B (a1B) independently form Ca2þ binding sites. All of the extra loops in domain A have b-turn structures formed by Tyr159-Thr162, Asp176-Tyr179, Thr251-Gly254, Asp276-Asn279, Asn335-Ser338, Ala363-Asn366 and Asp432-Asn435, giving a relatively rigid structure to the loop regions. Most of them are located on the face of the (b/a)8 barrel, exceptions being a short loop between a2A and b3A and an unusual insertion loop in the middle of a long a-helix (a3A). On the other hand, TVAII has only two extra loops compared to TVAI. They are located between domain N and A, and in domain B. The extra loop between domain N and A including five amino acid residues (Ile-His-ArgSer-Glu) with the structure of one-turn of 310 helix, causes the different orientation of domain N of TVAII from that of TVAI. The extra loop in domain B of TVAII is the highly disordered region, as mentioned above. Ca21 binding sites Many of the structure-solved a-amylases and a amylase family enzymes have a highly conserved Ca2þ binding site located between domains A and B. However, neither TVAI nor TVAII has a Ca2þ binding site at this conserved position, where NZ atoms of Lys residues (Lys318 in TVAI and Lys295 in TVAII) and water molecules play a role for the Ca ion to connect domains A and B, as reported.8 Besides this site, TVAI and TVAII have bound Ca ions at other sites. TVAI has three Ca2þ binding sites located at domains N, A and B, as shown in

Results
The quality of the structures TVAI, with a space group of C2 has one molecule in an asymmetric unit, whereas TVAI with a the space group of P21 and TVAII has two molecules in an asymmetric unit, related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis (see Materials and Methods). The final (2Fo 2 Fc) electron density maps of both crystal structures (1s contoured) shows that all atoms of proteins, solvent molecules and Ca ions were well fitted, except residues Ser276-Arg280 in TVAII, suggesting that this region is highly disordered. In Ramachandran plots,16 88.7% (Mol-1) and 90.0% (Mol-2) of residues in TVAI, and 91.1% (Mol-1) and 90.0% (Mol-2) of residues in TVAII were shown to be in the most favored regions, and no residue was in the disallowed regions, as determined by the program PROCHECK.17 Since in the crystal structure of both TVAI and TVAII, the structures of Mol-1 and Mol-2 are almost identical with the r.m.s. deviations for main-chain ° atoms between them being 0.45 A in TVAI, and ° 0.76 A in TVAII, the structural description here concentrates on Mol-1 (if not stated otherwise). Overall structures of TVAI and TVAII Figure 2 shows the overall structures of TVAI and TVAII as illustrated by the program MOLSCRIPT.18 TVAI is comprised of four domains and three bound Ca ions. The four domains are known as domain N (residues 1­ 123) with a distorted b-barrel structure, and domain A (124 ­265 and 321­ 553) with a (b/a)8 barrel structure, domain B

Asp189 and an oxygen atom of a water molecule. The third site is located in the TVAI-extra loop region of domain B, where a Ca ion is coordinated by the OD2 atom of Asp276, OD1 atom of Asn280, O atom of Phe281, O atom of Ser283, OE1 and OE2 atoms of Glu288, and an oxygen atom of a water molecule. All of the Ca2þ binding sites adopt a pentagonal bi-pyramid coordination structure with seven coordinating atoms. On the other hand, TVAII has only one Ca2þ binding site at domain A, where a Ca ion is coordinated by the OD1 atom of Asn143, O atom of Asp145, OD1 atom of Asn148, OD2 atom of Asp149, O atom of Gly169, OD2 atom of Asp171 and an oxygen atom of a water molecule. This site corresponds to the second Ca2þ binding site of TVAI, and the structure is strictly conserved. Figure 3 shows the thermostabilities of TVAI and TVAII in the presence or absence of a chelating reagent (EGTA). In the absence of EGTA, TVAI and TVAII lose 50% of inherent activity at 69.5 8C and 59.2 8C, respectively, and in the presence of EGTA, they lose it at 61.8 8C and 53.9 8C, respectively. This observation reveals that the bound Ca ions are closely related with the thermostabilities of enzymes and more affect the thermostabilty of TVAI than TVAII. Dimer structure Two molecules in an asymmetric unit of TVAI and TVAII are illustrated in Figure 4, viewed from the non-crystallographic 2-fold axes. These two molecules are the closest pair in the crystals, having the best contact. Interestingly, domain N is located at the inter-surface between the two molecules in both TVAI and TVAII, but these structures are completely different from each other. The active site of TVAI is independently located on opposite sides of the molecule facing away from each other, while that of TVAII is located on the inter-surface of the two molecules.

The intermolecular interaction between the two molecules in TVAI is not so strong, and the dimer structure observed as a crystal is expected not to occur in solution. On the other hand, TVAII forms a relatively stable dimer structure with many interactions as a crystal, where domain N mainly participates the inter-surface interactions of the dimer. The hydrophobic groove of TVAII between b1aN-b1bN and b7aN-b7bN is completely covered with another molecule in order to avoid exposing this region on the solvent-accessible surface. The difference in the dimer structure between TVAI and TVAII may be due to the relative orientation of domain N to domains A, B and C, caused by the extra loop in TVAII between domain N and A with the structure of one-turn of 310 helix. The maltogenic amylase, which has almost the same structure as TVAII and strong hydrolyzing activity for CDs, was reported to adopt the almost equivalent dimer structure to that of TVAII in a crystal and to form a dimer in solution.19 Recently, it was confirmed that TVAII also forms a dimer in solution at a high concentration (40 mg/ml) of the enzyme and that mutant TVAII without domain N exists as a monomer in solution, using size exclusion column chromatography.20 However, there is no evidence for the dimer structure in the organism at present. Active site structure Active site structures of TVAI and TVAII are shown superimposed in Figure 5. One b-CD from the X-ray structure of the E354A/b-CD complex and four glucose units of G6 from that of the D325N/G6 complex are also superimposed. Asp356(TVAI)/325(TVAII), Glu396/354 and Asp472/421, are key residues for hydrolyzing activity. In the first step of the proposed hydrolyzing mechanism, the OD atom of Asp356/325 attacks the C1 atom of the glucose unit at subsite 2 1 and the OE atom of Glu396/354 protonates

the O4 atom (glucosidic oxygen).21,22 Asp472/421 has been suggested to be involved in maintaining Glu396/354 in the correct site and also in stabilizing the transition state.13,23 The OE1 atom of Glu396 of TVAI forms a hydrogen bond with Trp398, causing its OE2 atom to face the OD1 atom of Asp356, and the OD1 atom of Asp472 is directed toward the OE1 atom of Glu396. This arrangement of Asp356, Glu396 and Asp472 is very similar to that in other structure-solved a-amylases24 ­ 27 and consistent with the proposed hydrolyzing mechanism. However, the three key residues of TVAII are arranged in a slightly different manner, with the OE1 atom of Glu354 directed toward the center of the OD atoms of Asp325 and the OD1 atom of Asp421 directed toward the center of OE atoms of Glu354, an arrangement very similar to that found in the X-ray structure of maltogenic amylase.19

His221/202, Tyr223/204 and Trp398/356 interact with the glucose units of a substrate to fix its location and orientation. His221/202 and Tyr223/ 204 are structurally conserved, but the side-chain conformation of Trp398 is completely different from that of Trp356. This is because Trp398 of TVAI exhibits a stacking interaction with Phe417. Although TVAII has Tyr374 corresponding to Phe417, the direction of its side-chain is completely different from that of Phe417. Phe286 of TVAII was found to be essential to recognize CD as a substrate.9 It interacts with the C6 atoms of two glucose units (subsites 2 1 and þ 1) at a hydrolyzing site from the inside of the CD cavity. TVAI also has Phe310 corresponding to Phe286 of TVAII, but subsequent residues (Leu311, Gly312, Phe313 and Asn314) adopt a different structure from the corresponding amino acid residues of TVAII (Ala287, Val288, Gln289 and

Val290). Phe310, Leu311, Gly312 and Phe313 of TVAI form a tight b-turn structure of type I, while the corresponding residues of TVAII form a loose turn structure. Consequently, the side-chains of Gln289 and Val290 of TVAII are located directly opposite those of Phe313 and Asn314 of TVAI. In TVAI, Phe310, Leu311 and Phe313 make van der Waals contacts forming a large hydrophobic cluster. Although TVAII also has hydrophobic residues in this region, they do not assemble as in TVAI. Tyr45* of TVAII is the residue from Mol-2, and interacts strongly with b-CD in the X-ray structure of the E354A/b-CD complex.9 Since the active site of TVAI is constructed of the residues from one molecule, TVAI has no residue corresponding to Tyr45* of TVAII. However, the side-chain of Leu311 occupies the space occupied by Tyr45* and Ala287 of TVAII, in contact with each other by hydrophobic interactions.

Discussion
The difference in substrate specificity between TVAI and TVAII TVAII partially exits as a dimer in solution. Furthermore, the accessible surface for substrate of TVAII is partially covered by its partner in the dimer structure. On the other hand, TVAI with a monomer has a wider accessible surface for substrate than TVAII. This may be a reason why TVAI has more hydrolyzing activity for high molecular mass substrates. As suggested by Park et al.,28 the formation of the dimer structure seems to provide a favorable active site to small a and b-CD

molecules, and also in TVAII, strong interactions of Tyr45* from Mol-2 with the bound b-CD in Mol-1 are found, showing that the formation of a dimer facilitates binding of a and b-CDs to the enzyme. However, at present, it is not clear whether the dimer structure is indispensable for the enzyme activity of TVAII, and whether it exists in vivo, as mentioned above. A large hydrophobic cluster formed by Phe310, Leu311 and Phe313 of TVAI may prevent a and b-CDs from binding to the enzyme, because, in the binding of a and b-CDs with the small cyclic structure to the active site of TVAI, steric hindrances should occur between Phe313 and the glucose units at subsites 2 3 and 2 4, as shown in Figure 5. On the other hand, in TVAII, only Phe286 exists in this region, providing a favorable site for a and b-CDs to bind to the enzyme. This may be why TVAI has no hydrolyzing activity for a and b-CDs. When a substrate binds to a-amylase, the torsion angles of glucosidic bonds at the hydrolyzing site deviate from those in the regular helical structure of amylose; 1008 (O5 ­C1 ­O40 ­C40 ) and 1098 (C1 ­ O40 ­ C40 ­ C30 ),29 because the Glu residue needs to protonate the glucosidic oxygen as the first step in the proposed hydrolyzing mechanism. In the X-ray structure of the D325N/G6 complex, the torsion angles of O5 ­C1 ­O40 ­C40 and C1 ­O40 ­ C40 ­ C30 at the hydrolyzing site (between subsites 2 1 and þ 1) are observed to be 508 and 908, respectively.10 However, a and b-CDs with a stable round-shaped structure cannot change their conformations in the glucosidic bond as G6. In the ° structure of E354A/b-CDs complex at 3.0 A resolution, the electron density of the omit map suggested that a b-CD at the active site maintained

its round-shaped structure.9 The conformation of Trp398 of TVAI favors G6-binding more than CD-binding, because Trp398 may interact nicely with the glucose unit of G6 whose glucosidic bonds are considerably deviated at the hydrolyzing site, and because it seems to have an unusually short contact with b-CD maintaining its round-shaped structure, as shown in Figure 5. On the other hand, Trp356 of TVAII does not interact strongly with glucose units in either b-CD or G6. It is reported that g-CD can change the conformations of the glucosidic bond like G6,30 because eight glucose units make the cyclic structure loose. This may be another reason why TVAI has no hydrolyzing activity for a, and b-CDs. Since a and b-CDs surely maintain a roundshaped structure through binding to the enzyme, it is very difficult for Glu354 of TVAII to protonate the O4 atom whose lone pairs face the center of the CDs, meaning that the TVAII-hydrolyzing mechanism for a and b-CDs should be slightly different from that for starch, as reported.9 The different arrangement of three key residues (Asp325, Glu354 and Asp421) found in TVAII and in maltogenic amylase from other structure-solved a-amylases including TVAI, might be related to the strong hydrolyzing activity of these enzymes for CDs.

The difference in thermostability between TVAI and TVAII Since the decrease of thermostabilities of enzymes were found by adding the chelating reagent EGTA, the bound Ca ions may be closely related to the thermostabilities of enzymes. The chelating reagent EGTA affects more the thermostability of TVAI with three bound Ca ions than that of TVAII with only one bound Ca ion, showing that the bound Ca2þ contributes more to the thermostability in TVAI than in TVAII. Between TVAI and TVAII, the number of bound Ca ions and the locations of Ca2þ binding sites are different, however, only from this study, it is not clear which is more effective to the thermostabilities of enzymes. Domain N is also possibly related to the stability of the whole structure of an enzyme. Domain N of TVAI makes many interactions with domains A and C, giving a structure of presumed higher conformational integrity and close to a spherical shape than is typical for family members containing only domains A, B and C. This observation is supported by the fact that thermostability of mutant TVAI without domain N decresed by 10 8C.20 On the other hand, domain N of TVAII is isolated from other domains and is a strong

using the program CNS42 with positional refinement. After 300 cycles of refinement, an R-factor reduced from 0.452 to 0.271, and phases from the refined model and the DM procedure were combined with the program SIGMAA43 in the CCP4 program suite to generate an improved map. After several cycles of refinement and phase combination, a model of 100% amino acid residues with an R-factor of 0.223 was obtained. Using the resultant structure as a probe model, molecular replacement was applied to solve the structure of Native-2. As expected, a clear solution of molecular orientation and position was obtained, where one of the crystallographic 2-fold axes in the C2 crystal was distorted, reducing the symmetry to P21. After positional refinement of this structure, a corrected model was rebuilt on the (2Fo 2 Fc) electron density map, and water molecules were gradually introduced if the peaks above 4.0s in the (Fo 2 Fc) electron density map were in the range of a hydrogen bond. To avoid overfitting of the diffraction data, a free R-factor with 10% of the test set excluded from refinement44 was monitored. After several cycles, a model with an R-factor of 0.189 was obtained. ° The structure of TVAII at 2.3 A resolution was refined ° by the program CNS, using the structure solved at 2.6 A resolution (RCSB PDB code 1BVZ)45 as the starting model. The water-adding procedure for TVAII was the same as that for TVAI. Finally, a refined structure with an R-factor of 0.179 was obtained. Thermostability assay TVAI and TVAII, which were prepared at the same concentration (4.0 mM), were each incubated at 25 8C for 30 minutes in the presence or absence of the chelating reagent of 2.5 mM ethylenglycol-bis(b-aminioethylether)tetraacetate (EGTA) in 20 mM Tris ­ HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The samples were subjected to various temperatures for 30 minutes and placed on ice for five minites, and then the hydrolyzing activity for starch in the samples was assayed using the Nelson ­ Somogyi method. The enzyme reaction was carried out in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 40 8C. The enzyme activities were assessed as the rate of activity in the presence or absence of EGTA at 25 8C. We assumed that residual activity (%) (RAcalc) is expressed by the following equation: RAcalc ¼ 100 þ ½2100T n =ðHn þ T n Þ where T is temperature, and H is the temperature where the enzyme loses 50% of inherent activity. This equation is derived from the Hill equation of a sigmoid curve. The best H and n values were obtained by minimizing SðRAobs 2 RAcalc Þ2 using the least-squares method. Protein Data Bank accession number The atomic coordinates and structure factors of TVAI (code 1JI1) and TVAII (code 1JI2) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.

driving force for the formation of a dimer in solution. With its spherical shaped structure, TVAI as a monomer may be more stable than TVAII as a dimer, where domain N attaches mainly to the molecular contact surface. As the thermostability of a-amylases should be the result of many different contributions,31 there should be other factors besides the bound Ca ion and the orientation of domain N. The striking structural differences between TVAI and TVAII are the many extra loops in TVAI. Careful investigation of the extra loops might give insights into the thermostability of this enzyme.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and X-ray data collection The purification and crystallization of TVAI and TVAII have been reported.32,33 Diffraction data of native TVAI (Native-1) and two heavy-atom derivatives (Pb(CH3COO)2 and K2PtCL4) of TVAI were collected by a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc imaging plate system34 on a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode X-ray generator with monochromated Cu Ka radiation at room temperature (298 K). Data collections at 100 K for the native crystal of TVAI (Native-2) and TVAII were carried out using synchrotron radiation on BL-6A at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). Crystals stored in a 20 mM Mes buffer (pH 6.1) with 15 % (w/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 15% (w/v) PEG6000 were picked by crystal loops and immediately frozen in a stream of evaporating nitrogen. Diffraction data were then collected using an ADSC/CCD detector system at 100 K. Data processing and scaling between native and derivatives were carried out with DENZO,35 MOSFLM36 and the CCP4 program suite.37 The collected data and scaling results are listed in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The structure of TVAI was determined by the MIR method using two heavy-atom derivatives and the molecular replacement method. To prepare the heavyatom derivatives, crystals were soaked in heavy-atom solutions (2 mM Pb(CH3COO)2 and 2 mM K2PtCL4) for 24 hours. Four positions of Pb atoms were determined from the difference Patterson map of Native-1 and the Pb derivative, and the parameters were refined using ° ° 20 A ­ 2.5 A resolution data with the program Xheavy in the XtalView system.38 To obtain initial phases, single ° ° isomorphous replacement (SIR)39 against 20 A ­ 2.5 A resolution data was carried out, using the program DM40 in the CCP4 program suite. Four positions of Pt atoms were found in the difference map with coefficients (FPt 2 Fnative) and the phases from the SIR procedure. ° ° After the refinement of Pt parameters using 20 A ­ 2.5 A resolution data, multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) phases were calculated with the program MLPHARE41 in the CCP4 program suite. The overall figure-of-merit was 0.68 for the paired reflections in ° ° 20 A ­ 2.5 A resolution data, and the phases were refined by ten cycles of solvent flattening. An initial model with 87% amino acid residues could be built based on the electron density map obtained with the resultant phases, using the program Xfit in the XtalView system. The ° ° model was refined against 30.0 A ­ 2.5 A resolution data
