Lynn Sherrer,2 Liang Feng,2 Emmanuelle Schmitt,3 Michel Panvert,3 ¨ Sylvain Blanquet,3 Yves Mechulam,3 Dieter Soll,2 Osamu Nureki1 Glutaminyl­transfer RNA (Gln-tRNAGln) in archaea is synthesized in a pretranslational amidation of misacylated Glu-tRNAGln by the heterodimeric Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase GatDE. Here we report the crystal structure of the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus GatDE complexed to tRNAGln at 3.15 angstroms resolution. Biochemical analysis of GatDE and of tRNAGln mutants characterized the catalytic centers for the enzyme's three reactions (glutaminase, kinase, and amidotransferase activity). A 40 angstrom­long channel for ammonia transport connects the active sites in GatD and GatE. tRNAGln recognition by indirect readout based on shape complementarity of the D loop suggests an early anticodon-independent RNA-based mechanism for adding glutamine to the genetic code. he formation of at least 20 sets of aminoacyl­transfer RNA (aa-tRNA) is a requirement for protein biosynthesis and its accuracy. In most cases, aa-tRNA synthesis is achieved by direct acylation of tRNA with the cognate amino acid catalyzed by the aminoacyltRNA synthetases (aaRSs) (1). However, a number of aa-tRNAs are made by pretranslational tRNA-dependent amino acid modification processes. These include selenocysteinyl-tRNA (2), cysteinyl-tRNA in methanogenic archaea (3), and amide aa-tRNAs (Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA) in most prokaryotes (4). These pretranslational amino acid modifications represent essential, older pathways of aa-tRNA synthesis (5­8) and are probably the routes by which these amino acids first entered the genetic code (2). Lateral gene transfer of an aaRS may have replaced these indirect pathways in some organisms (9). These pathways also provide the sole route for the supply of asparagine in many bacteria (10) and of cysteine in methanogens (3). Given the mechanistic unity of the synthesis of most aa-tRNAs, it was surprising to discover the lack of conservation in Gln-tRNA formation (11). The eukaryotic cytoplasm uses direct acylation of tRNAGln by glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS), whereas most bacteria and all archaea use a tRNA-dependent transamidation route (11). The first step in this route for Gln-tRNA synthesis is the formation of misacylated Glu-tRNAGln by a Bnondiscriminating[ (ND) glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS), an aaRS that is also responsible

for the formation of Glu-tRNAGlu (12). This mischarged tRNA is then converted by amidation to the properly charged Gln-tRNAGln by a Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase (11, 13). Nature has two Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferases; archaea employ the heterodimeric GatDE enzyme (11), whereas bacteria use heterotrimeric GatCAB protein (13). Each enzyme has one

subunit (GatA or GatD) for ammonia production, yet they are structurally different; GatA is homologous to amidases (13) and GatD is similar to a type I L-asparaginase (AnsA) (11). The other crucial amidotransferase subunit (GatB or GatE) belongs to the Pet112 protein family (14), which consists only of highly related GatB/GatE proteins. They catalyze two reactions: (i) the phosphorylation of the g-carboxyl group of glutamate in Glu-tRNAGln by a kinase activity (15), and (ii) conversion of the tRNA-bound phosphoglutamate to glutamine by an amidotransferase activity (15, 16) using ammonia generated by GatA/ GatD. These amidotransferases may be examples of how amino acid­metabolizing enzymes were recruited during evolution to aa-tRNA formation and thus protein synthesis (4). Recently, the crystal structure of the Pyrococcus abyssi GatDE apoenzyme was reported (17). It revealed that the GatD and GatE subunits form an a2b2 tetramer, and Ebased on earlier biochemical experiments (15)^ residues of the glutaminase catalytic site were suggested to be located in GatD. This left unresolved the structural and biochemical definition of all three active sites and their interconnection, as well as the nature and specificity of binding the tRNA substrate. Here we report the crystal structure of the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus GatDE complexed to

tRNAGln at 3.15 ) resolution. Combined with biochemical data, this structure reveals a mechanism of concerted action of the three enzymatic activities regulated by Glu-tRNAGln. The structural implications of tRNAGln recognition by indirect RNA readout based on shape complementarity of the D loop suggest an early anticodon-independent RNA-based mechanism for adding glutamine to the genetic code. As in the P. abyssi GatDE apoenzyme (17), the GatD subunit consists of three domains: the N-terminal domain, the AnsA-like domain 1, and the AnsA-like domain 2 (Fig. 1). The GatE subunit is made up of a cradle domain, an AspRS-like insertion domain of 123 amino acids, a helical domain, and the C-terminal tail domain (residues 562 to 616) (Fig. 1). This tail domain shares considerable sequence similarity with the C-terminal half of Bacillus subtilis YqeY, a protein of unknown function (18). Its topology EProtein Data Bank (PDB) identification number 1NG6^ could be fitted into the electron density of the GatE tail domain, and the main chain could be traced into a three-helix bundle, with the side chains disordered. The orientation of the GatE helical and tail domains in the tRNA complex is different from that in the apoenzyme structure to allow interaction with tRNAGln (figs. S1 and S2). tRNAGln makes contact only with the GatE subunit, and the tRNA anticodon does not interact with the protein (Fig. 1). This was unexpected, because anticodon recognition, as in aaRSs (19), would be sufficient for discrimination between tRNAGln and tRNAGlu. GatE enfolds the acceptorTYC helix of the tRNA molecule (Fig. 1), as the CCA-adding RNA polymerase does (20, 21). The helical domain and the C-terminal tail domain form a concave surface, which snugly fits the tRNA elbow region comprising the TYC arm and the D loop (Fig. 1). The helical domain interacts with the minor groove of the TYC stem, whereas the C-terminal tail domain invades the TYC-loop&D-loop assembling region. The helical domain folds into a superhelical architecture that is structurally similar to the body domain of the class-II CCA-adding polymerase (21, 22); these enzymes also recognize the tRNA TYC arm in a shape-complementary manner (21). GatDE accurately discriminates tRNAGln from tRNAGlu and tRNAAsn, and amidates only the misacylated Glu-tRNAGln (11). In contrast, both Glu-tRNAGln and Asp-tRNAAsn are substrates for GatCAB (23). Because GatB lacks the AspRS-like insertion domain found in GatE, it was suggested that this GatE domain may be an antideterminant against tRNAAsn (17). However, in the GatDE&RNAGln structure, the AspRS-like insertion domain does not contact the tRNA (Fig. 1), and we suggest a different role for this domain (see below). The tRNAGln ACCA-terminus (positions 73 to 76) enters the central cleft of the GatE cradle domain. At its entrance, the amide group of Gln240 forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with N3 (3.3 )) of the adenine ring and the ribose 2¶-OH (2.5 )) of the discriminator base A73 (Fig. 2A). This base is conserved in the M. thermautotrophicus tRNAGln, tRNAGlu, and tRNAAsn species (fig. S3). The mutation of Gln240 to Ala resulted in a 2.1-fold loss of the amidotransferase activity (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, Lys401 in the cradle domain and

Arg503 in the helical domain provide electrostatic interactions with the phosphate backbones of A73 and C74 of tRNAGln, respectively (Fig. 2A). The replacement of Arg503 with Ala reduced the amidotransferase activity by 1.7 fold (Fig. 3C). The helical domain interacts with the minor groove of the tRNAGln TYC stem (Fig. 1). The Tyr496 hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonds (2.6 )) to the 2¶-hydroxyl of G53 in the TYC stem, whereas the d-amino group of Gln467 and the e-amino group of Arg471 hydrogen-bond with the 2¶-OH of C62 (Fig. 2B). Arg503 electrostatically interacts (3.6 )) with the backbone phosphate of C62 (Fig. 2B). Base-specific recognition is observed for G52, whose 2-amino group hydrogen-bonds to the b-carboxyl group of Asp463 (Fig. 2B). Changing this residue to Ala reduced amidotransferase activity by 1.5 fold, and replacement of Arg503 with Ala lowered the transamidation activity by 1.7 fold (Fig. 3C). However, G52, G53, and C62 are common to the tRNAGln, tRNAGlu, and tRNAAsn species (fig. S3). Thus, the GatDE interactions with the TYC stem do not contribute to tRNA discrimination but may anchor the TYC arm to properly position the TYC-loop&D-loop­assembling region toward the tail domain. The two helices in the tail domain form a concave surface to accommodate the TYC and D loops (Fig. 1). Although the side chains are disordered, two helices of the tail domain closely contact the TYC-loop&D-loop­assembling region, especially C56 and G18 (Fig. 2C and fig. S4). As a result, the Watson-Crick type tertiary base pair between C56 and G18 is significantly twisted (Fig. 2C). The concave surface formed by the two helices prevents the accommodation of larger TYC and D loops; this appears to be crucial for the discrimination of tRNAGln from tRNAGlu. Comparison of the relevant tRNA sequences (fig. S3) reveals that tRNAGlu possesses a D loop that is three nucleotides larger than those of both tRNAGln species. This bigger loop may act as an antideterminant in tRNAGlu recognition. On the other hand, tRNAAsn has a D loop of different nucleotide sequence yet similar in size to that of tRNAGln. To experimentally determine the basis for tRNAGln recognition by M. thermautotrophicus GatDE, we constructed tRNA mutants Esee the supporting online material (SOM)^ and (i) tested tRNA recognition (RNA binding) by gel retardation and (ii) determined the tRNA identity (19) by assessing the ability of the homologous mutant tRNAs to be enzyme substrates in the amidotransferase reaction. The two methods may produce some differences, because (i) measures RNA binding; whereas for (ii), productive binding is required. Because the structure revealed binding by shape complementarity of the D loop, we prepared mutants of tRNAGln in which its D loop or TYC loop was replaced with that of tRNAGlu and the D loop/stem of tRNAGln was replaced with that of tRNAAsn; this resulted in the Dloop chimeras tRNAGlnDGlu and tRNAGlnDAsn and the T-loop chimera tRNAGlnTGlu. Although there was slightly reduced binding activity by the tRNAGlnTGlu and tRNAGlnDAsn mutants, tRNAGlnDGlu did not bind (Fig. 2D). In contrast to the gel-shift results, the Glu-tRNAGlnDGlu and Glu-tRNAGlnDAsn species could not be transamidated by GatDE, whereas Glu-tRNAGlnTGlu supported the transamidation reaction (Fig. 2D). Similarly, the glutamylated U19A and A20U tRNAGln1 mutants did not support amidotransferase activity, although these mutant tRNAs bind to GatDE (Fig. 2D). Thus, the C-terminal helical and tail domains of GatE play a key role in discriminating tRNAGln from tRNAGlu by shape complementarity as well as by specific nucleotide recognition. Another significant identity element difference between tRNAGln, tRNAGlu, and tRNAAsn might be the first base pair of the acceptor helix; this is A1&U72 in tRNAGln and G1&C72 in tRNAGlu and tRNAAsn (fig. S3). The G1&C72 tRNAGln mutant showed 50 times less amidotransferase activity, with the GatE-binding

activity unaffected (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the G1&C72 base pair in tRNAAsn will be a major antideterminant for GatDE recognition. The tRNAGln ACCA-terminus enters the central cavity of the GatE cradle domain; the bases of C74 and C75 stack on each other, and the O2 atom of C74 hydrogen-bonds to the Arg412 e-amino group (Fig. 3A). In contrast to C74 and C75, we did not observe electron density corresponding to A76. Possibly glutamylation is a prerequisite to place A76 in its binding site. In the vicinity of C75 there is a pocket large enough to accommodate glutamyl adenosine. In the catalytic pocket, Mg2þ is observed; it is coordinated with the strictly conserved His15, Glu157, and Glu184 residues. This pocket is expected to house the Glu-tRNAGln kinase and amidotransferase activities, and the coordinated Mg2þ should play a catalytic role in both reactions. By molecular dynamics, we then modeled glutamyl adenosine (position 76) in the catalytic pocket (Fig. 3A), so that the adenine ring was sandwiched between Arg412 and Pro415 (Fig. 3A), the N6 atom hydrogen bonded with the main-chain carbonyl group of Val413, and the Oe atom of the glutamyl moiety (covalently attached to the 2¶-OH of A76) was pointed toward the Mg2þ in order to be ready for phosphorylation. The a-carbonyl and a-amino groups of the glutamyl moiety are recognized by the conserved amino acids Lys237 and Glu235, respectively, through hydrogen-bonding interactions (Fig. 3A). The phosphate group of A76 forms a hydrogen bond with Arg221 in the GatE cradle domain, which simultaneously interacts electrostatically with the phosphate group of C75 (Fig. 3A). The conserved Arg177 also provides an electrostatic interaction with the A76 phosphate moiety (Fig. 3B). Before the amidotransferase reaction, the g-carboxyl group of the glutamyl moiety attached Fig. 4. Ternary complex formation between GatE, GluRS, and tRNAGln. Docking of T. thermophilus GluRS complexed with tRNAGlu (29) onto the present GatE&tRNAGln complex was accomplished by superposing the complexed tRNA structures. In GatDE, the AspRS-like insertion domain, cradle domain, helical domain, and tail domain are colored violet, cyan, orange, and pink, respectively. GluRS and tRNA are shown in gray and yellow, respectively. to A76 is phosphorylated with concurrent hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). We therefore constructed a docking model of GatDE and ATP by superposing the ADP/AlFx-bound GatB structure (24) onto that of GatE (Fig. 3A). This docking model is reliable because the ATP-binding pocket exhibits 53.6% amino acid identity and root mean square deviation of 0.665 ) (28 Ca atoms) between GatE and GatB, with the ATP-interacting Pro189, Ser225, Asn227, and Arg233 being strictly conserved. In this model, the g-phosphate group of ATP coordinates to the essential Mg2þ (Fig. 3A). Thus, His15, Glu157, Glu184, the g-carboxyl group of the glutamate attached to the tRNA, the g-phosphate of the ATP substrate, and a water molecule octahedrally coordinate with the Mg2þ ion (Fig. 3A). This Mg2þ coordination may accelerate the polarization of the gphosphorus group of ATP and the g-carboxyl group of the tRNA-bound glutamate, promoting the nucleophilic reaction that forms g-phosphorylglutamyl-tRNAGln. To corroborate the assignment of the three catalytic sites by functional enzymatic tests (glutaminase, kinase, and transamidase activities), mutant GatDE enzymes were generated in which critical amino acids were replaced by alanine (see SOM). Earlier studies (15) showed the essential nature of the GatD residues Thr101, Thr177, Asn178, and Lys254 for glutaminase activity of the heterodimeric enzyme. However, the mutant enzymes retained kinase and amidotransferase activity when ammonium chloride was the amide donor (15). Analysis of the GatE structure assigned the kinase and transamidase active sites to the vicinity of the Mg2þ with the strictly conserved residues His15, Glu157, and Glu184 (Fig. 3A). The enzymes resulting from mutation of these amino acids lost the ATPase and amidotransferase activities but kept the glutaminase function (Fig. 3C). A similar pattern of activities was found (Fig. 3C) in mutant enzymes with alterations in other assigned conserved amino acids EArg221, Lys237, and Arg412 (Fig. 3A) and Arg177, Asp223, and Glu235 (Fig. 3B)^. The reduction of glutaminase activity in the mutant Arg221Ala, Glu235Ala, and Lys237Ala enzymes supports the observed coupling of the GatD glutaminase activity with Glu-tRNAGln binding by GatE (15). The GatDE&tRNAGln complex structure makes clear that the kinase/amidotransferase catalytic site on GatE is located 40 ) apart from the glutaminase site on GatD (Fig. 1). How does ammonia generated at the latter site move to the kinase/amidotransferase site on the other subunit? In the vicinity of the catalytic Mg2þ ion, there is a hole (Fig. 3A) that is the exit of an intersubunit 40 )­long molecular tunnel, which connects the GatD glutaminase site and the GatE kinase/amidotransferase site (Fig. 3B). This tunnel penetrates one GatE and two GatD subunits, the entrance being located on the interface of the GatD dimer (Fig. 3B). With an average diameter of 2 ), the tunnel should be capable of transporting ammonia. The amino acids that line the inside of the tunnel have hydrophilic properties; a sequence alignment reveals that they are strictly conserved in archaea. Therefore, we propose that the ammonium generated at the glutaminase site in GatD is transported along the molecular tunnel to the kinase center of GatE, where it amidates gphosphoryl-Glu-tRNAGln. In the present structure, we observed several electron densities, corresponding to water or possibly ammonium molecules along the tunnel (Fig. 3B), which suggests that the mechanism of ammonia transport resembles that of potassium transport by a Kþ channel (25). Mutations of two amino acids ELeu178(GatE)Phe and Leu336(GatD)Phe^ located along the molecular tunnel (Fig. 3B) significantly reduced the amidotransferase activity (Fig. 3C). The Tyr373(GatD)Phe mutation, situated at the entrance of the tunnel (Fig. 3B), reduced the amidotransferase and glutaminase activities considerably (Fig. 3C); this suggests that Tyr373 plays a role in withdrawing and attracting the generated ammonia into the tunnel. Which residue(s) deprotonate the transported ammonium at the exit of the tunnel and direct it to react with the phosphorylated glutamate carboxyl group? Sequence and functional analyses indicated that Lys119, whose e-amino group is activated by the adjacent GatE residues Gln131, Glu157, and Glu184, and by GatD Tyr55, is involved in the deprotonation of the ammonium (Fig. 3, B and C). Generally, enzymes using glutamine as an amide donor are thought to have a molecular tunnel, through which ammonium is transferred from the glutaminase site to the second synthetase site (16, 26). A recent structural analysis reported that glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase opens its molecular tunnel by rotating the indole ring of a Trp

residue upon the binding of the glutamine substrate to the glutaminase site (27). Elucidation of a similar tunnel-gating mechanism will await the structure determination of GatDE complexed with acylated Glu-tRNAGln. The presence of misacylated Glu-tRNAGln as the required precursor for Gln-tRNAGln prompted the question of whether there is a complex between the ND-GluRS and the GlutRNAGln amidotransferase, where the misacylated tRNA would be transferred from the synthetase to the amidotransferase by substrate channeling (28). This would ameliorate the task of EF-Tu in keeping protein synthesis accurate by not transporting Glu-tRNAGln to the ribosome (29). Preliminary experiments suggest the existence of a complex between M. thermautotrophicus GluRS and GatDE; we then docked T. thermophilus GluRS complexed with tRNAGlu (30) onto the present GatDE&tRNAGln complex by superposing the tRNA structures (Fig. 4). GluRS fits well into the concave surface formed by the GatE cradle and the AspRS-like insertion domains, and the bound tRNAGln extensively interacts with the AspRS-like insertion domain with only minor steric clashes. A similar docking of the AspRS&tRNAAsp complex (31) did not succeed because of serious steric hindrance, especially with the AspRS-like insertion domain. Thus, the AspRS-like insertion domain may facilitate formation of a GluRS&GatDE complex while preventing association with AspRS. As a result, the ternary complex would produce and channel only GlutRNAGln, which is the sole substrate for transamidation by GatDE (11). The presence of such a complex could also account for the lack of the AspRS-like insertion domain in GatCAB, which converts not only Glu-tRNAGln but also Asp-tRNAAsn to the corresponding amide aa-tRNAs (23). The putative GluRS&GatDE complex, in which tRNAGln interacts simultaneously with the ND-GluRS and the AspRS-like GatE insertion domain, mimics one of the aaRS class I/class II/tRNA complexes that have been proposed as intermediates in the evolution of the aaRS classes (32). This had further experimental support in the observed ternary complex of the two classes of Methanosarcina barkeri lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) and tRNAPyl (33) and of LysRS1&LysRS2&tRNAother from Bacillus cereus (34). The presence of such a ternary complex in transamidation would give credence to the idea that this pathway is a remnant of early code formation. Furthermore, unlike temporary aaRSs, GatE mainly uses indirect sequence-independent readout for the recognition of tRNAGln, a mechanism that also operates in EF-Tu (35) and tRNA-modifying enzymes (36). Taken together, the data suggest that a GatDE-like structure and activity were appended to an existing GluRS to provide the physical and mechanistic means of adding glutamine to the genetic code.

Ammonia Channel Couples Glutaminase with Transamidase Reactions in GatCAB
Akiyoshi Nakamura,1* Min Yao,1* Sarin Chimnaronk,1,2 Naoki Sakai,1 Isao Tanaka1 The formation of glutaminyl transfer RNA (Gln-tRNAGln) differs among the three domains of life. Most bacteria employ an indirect pathway to produce Gln-tRNAGln by a heterotrimeric glutamine amidotransferase CAB (GatCAB) that acts on the misacylated Glu-tRNAGln. Here, we describe a series of crystal structures of intact GatCAB from Staphylococcus aureus in the apo form and in the complexes with glutamine, asparagine, Mn2þ, and adenosine triphosphate analog. Two identified catalytic centers for the glutaminase and transamidase reactions are markedly distant but connected ° by a hydrophilic ammonia channel 30 A in length. Further, we show that the first U-A base pair in the acceptor stem and the D loop of tRNAGln serve as identity elements essential for discrimination by GatCAB and propose a complete model for the overall concerted reactions to synthesize Gln-tRNAGln. ccurate translation of the genetic code into proteins requires high efficiency and fidelity of tRNA-aminoacylation (1). This vital process is governed by a fundamental family of enzymes called aminoacyl-

A

tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which catalyze the direct attachment of amino acids to the 3¶-ends of the corresponding tRNAs. However, Gln-tRNAGln is synthesized by two different pathways in nature (2­4). In the eukaryotic cy-
