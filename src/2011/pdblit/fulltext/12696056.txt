Yasuyuki Matoba and Masanori Sugiyama* Department of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan

ABSTRACT We have found a secreted phospholipase A2 (PLA2, EC 3.1.1.4) from Streptomyces violaceoruber A-2688, which is the first PLA2 identified in prokaryote, and determined its tertiary structure by NMR and X-ray analyses. In this study, we collected the X-ray diffraction data of the bacterial PLA2 at room temperature (297 K) using conventional MoK radiation and refined the structure at a 1.05 ≈ resolution. The atomic resolution analysis led us to introduce disordered conformations and hydrogen atoms into a full anisotropic model. The molecular motion, which is expressed as the sum of rigidbody motion and internal motion of protein, is roughly estimated as the thermal motion when the X-ray diffraction data are collected at room temperature. In this study, we applied a TLS (rigid-body motion in terms of translation, libration, and screw motions) model to analyze the rigid-body motion of the bacterial PLA2 and calculated the internal motion by subtracting the estimate of the rigid-body motion from the observed anisotropic temperature factor. We also subjected the TLS model to estimate the internal motion of the bovine pancreatic PLA2 using the anisotropic temperature factor deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Both results indicate that the localization of regions exhibiting larger internal motion in the bacterial PLA2 is almost the same as that in the bovine pancreatic PLA2, suggesting that although the tertiary structure of the bacterial PLA2 is strikingly different from that of the bovine pancreatic PLA2, the internal motion, which is associated with the calcium(II) ion-binding, phospholipidbinding, and allosteric interfacial activation, is commonly observed in both PLA2s.

Sheldrick1 as the data extending to at least a 1.2 ≈ resolution, with at least 50% of intensities higher than 2 in the outer resolution shell. One half of the crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)2 are classified as proteins refined at high resolutions, but only a few cases of proteins determined at true atomic resolution exist.3≠10 The tertiary structures of most proteins have been determined by restrained refinement to maintain their regular stereochemistry with isotropic temperature factors instead of anisotropic ones expressed with six parameters, due to the relatively small number of diffraction data when compared with the number of free parameters. Such restrictions are reduced and partially removed if the diffraction data are observed at atomic resolution. In addition, most of the X-ray data collection to be refined at atomic resolution has been performed at a freezing temperature to reduce the irradiation damage to the crystals and to extend the resolution. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2, EC 3.1.1.4), which is divided into intra- or extracellular types, hydrolyzes the 2-acyl ester bonds of 1,2-diacylglycero-3-phospholipids. As far as we know, the consensus has long been that the secreted enzymes are produced solely by eukaryote. Secreted PLA2 is a lipolytic enzyme that requires a calcium(II) ion for the expression of enzyme activity. We have found a secreted PLA2 that is produced by a filamentous bacterium Streptomyces violaceoruber, demonstrating that the enzyme is the first PLA2 identified in a prokaryote.11 Secreted PLA2s have very high catalytic activities relative to the aggregated substrates when compared with the monomeric substrates, a phenomenon known as "interfacial activation."12 Several models have been proposed for

an explanation of the activation process.13≠16 However, the mechanism for interfacial activation has not been clearly evaluated, because the enzyme activity in the absence of the aggregates of phospholipids cannot be precisely measured. With regard to "interfacial activation," two prevailing hypotheses, a substrate model and an enzyme model, have been proposed. A substrate model attributes the high activity of PLA2 in the presence of interfaces to the altered properties of the substrate in these interfaces. An important substrate model assumes that the phospholipids in the aggregate take some conformation that makes a facilitated diffusion into the active site possible.13,14 A common feature of the substrate models is that the enzyme is structurally invariant, irrespective of the absence or presence of a lipid≠water interface. An enzyme model states that the conformational change of PLA2 induced by phospholipid binding optimizes the active site and enhances catalysis in the enzyme.16 The structural studies on the porcine pancreatic PLA2 have been performed with the NMR method,17≠19 revealing that some conformational changes occur in the enzyme complexed with a monomeric substrate analogue and/or phospholipid, which might provide a structural basis for the allosteric interfacial activation. Regions such as the N-terminus and surface loop, which are flexible in the phospholipid-free pancreatic PLA2, become more ordered in the enzyme bound to a higher molecular phospholipid, such as the cytoplasmic membrane and micelles. It appears that the crystal structures of the phospholipid-free PLA2 are similar to those of the phospholipid-bound enzyme, which may be due to the ordering inherent in the crystallization process. We have shown that the overall structure of the prokaryotic PLA2 is strikingly different from that of other secreted PLA2s.11,20 Our goal is to refine the structure of the bacterial PLA2 at atomic resolution based on the X-ray diffraction data collected at room temperature and to observe the intramolecular motion. Most atomic resolution studies have been carried out in freezing conditions with

the use of liquid nitrogen or helium gas. Because freezing conditions are unsuitable for observing molecular motion, we attempted to collect the X-ray diffraction data of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 crystal at room temperature (297 K) using conventional MoK radiation and refined the structure at atomic resolution with anisotropic temperature factors. The refinement at atomic resolution enables us to analyze the thermal motion in the S. violaceoruber PLA2. In this study, the internal motion is estimated from the thermal motion, and the catalytic mechanism of PLA2 is discussed, including calcium(II) ion binding, phospholipid binding, and the conformational change during interfacial activation, which are presumed from the internal motion. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Data Collection and Processing The crystallization of S. violaceoruber PLA2 has been previously described.20 The crystal used for diffraction analysis belongs to the monoclinic space group P21 with the unit cell dimensions a 29.34 ≈, b 57.50 ≈, c 31.81 ≈, and 111.07∞, with one molecule per asymmetric unit. We collected atomic resolution data at 297 K using the R-AXIS IV imaging plate with the graphite monochromated MoK radiation from the rotating anode generator (RU-200, 50 kV, and 100 mA). Each oscillation frame was taken with a rotation of 1∞ for 12 min at a crystal-todetector distance of 150 mm. The diffraction intensities recorded on 180 frames were integrated and scaled by the program Process.21 A total of 120,824 reflections were merged to 45,532 independent reflections, with an Rmerge of 7.16%. This data set is 67.5% complete to a 0.92 ≈ resolution. Data collection statistics as a function of resolution are shown in Table I. The lack of completeness in the higher resolution shells is due to weak intensities, which were not significantly above the background. However, in the resolution bin between 1.168 and 1.114 ≈, the ratio of the number of the observed reflections with I 2 to that of the expected reflections was 51.3%. Thus, these data

meet the demand for the atomic resolution defined by Sheldrick.1 Structure Refinement Previously determined crystal structure of the calcium(II) ion-free form of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 at a 1.4 ≈ resolution20 served as a starting point for further refinement. Initially, refinement of the model was performed with the program X-PLOR22 with the use of isotropic temperature factors. After two X-PLOR refinement steps, including 300 cycles of positional parameters refinement and 40 cycles of individual isotropic temperature factors refinement, the R-factor for the 90% of the reflections from 10.0 to 1.1 ≈ resolution with F 2 dropped from an initial value of 26.3% to 18.4%. The test set including 10% of the reflections was used for the cross-validation analysis to monitor the progress of the refinement.23 The free R-factor (Rfree) of this subset was 20.9% at this stage. The 2FO-FC map was of a very high quality. The atoms were well resolved, indicating that a true atomic resolution was already achieved. Subsequently, the model was refined by restrained conjugate gradient least-squares (CGLS) minimization24 equipped in SHELXL-9725 against the reflections from 10.0 to 1.1 ≈ resolution with F 0. The introduction of the SWAT parameters in SHELXL reduced the R-factor and Rfree values apparently by modeling the effect of the diffuse solvent regions,26 although the crystal has a low solvent content of 33%, according to Matthews.27 During earlier refinement steps, the electron density maps suggested anisotropic vibrations throughout the molecule, and the switch from isotropic to restrained anisotropic displacement parameter refinement dramatically improved the R-factor, Rfree, and the electron density maps. The drop in both R-factor and Rfree values unambiguously demonstrated that anisotropic refinement was meaningful. Further refinement was therefore carried out by considering all the nonhydrogen atoms as anisotropic, except for all newly added atoms, which were always refined isotropically (two or three cycles) before being taken as anisotropic. The anisotropic treatment of the atoms resulted in high-quality electron density, which allowed us to model disorder. Accordingly, in subsequent refinement steps, alternative conformations for several side-chains and water molecules were introduced. The occupancies of the components of each conformation were individually refined and their sum was constrained to unity. The successive removal of the density in the difference maps by modeling the alternative conformations contributed to the slight decreases in both the R-factor and the Rfree values. In the SHELXL refinement, good geometry is maintained by imposing Engh and Huber28 restraints on the model. Also, temperature factors of two bonded atoms were restrained to be equal. We optimized the stringency of the restraints empirically by adjusting the standard deviations (DEFS parameters in SHELXL) that are applied to restraint target values. Rfree values23 were used as a monitor to validate each parameter change. Optimiza-

tion of the parameters results in relaxing the restraints. The final values of the target standard deviations for model geometry were 0.03 ≈ for bond lengths, 0.06 ≈ for angle distances, and 0.15 ≈3 for chiral volumes and flat groups. With respect to the temperature factors, bonded atoms were restrained in both isotropic and anisotropic refinement to have same temperature factors, with a target standard deviation of 0.08 ≈2. For anisotropic refinement, six parameters describing the thermal vibration (Uij) were refined for nonhydrogen atom. For each pair of chemically bonded atoms, the components of the anisotropic displacement parameters along the line joining them were restrained to be equal with a target standard deviation of 0.02 ≈2. The value of the ISOR parameter, with which the Uij values of water molecules was restrained to approximate isotropic behavior, was also relaxed to 0.2 ≈2. One consequence of the relaxed restraints is that the deviations from ideal geometry of the current structure appear to be larger than those in other structures. The building of water structure was carried out by means of an interactive, automatic water divining procedure implemented in SHELXL-97.25 After each refinement cycle, the difference in Fourier synthesis was automatically analyzed to find the highest peaks that involve no bad contact and to make at least one geometrically plausible hydrogen bond to a polar atom. The corresponding solvent sites were automatically appended in the output file. This automated update of solvent, combined with graphical checking for well-defined spherical densities greater than 3 in the FO-FC map, was used to obtain solvent sites that were included in the subsequent refinement cycle with unitary occupancies. The density threshold used for selection of new solvent sites during the whole refinement was 0.25 e≈ 3. After each refinement cycle, recently added sites were carefully checked. The criteria for retaining solvent sites were that they have densities greater than 0.5 in the 2FO-FC map, that they be at correct hydrogenbonding distances from plausible partners, and that they not be too close to protein atoms. The shortest acceptable distance for solvent≠solvent and solvent≠protein pairs of atoms was 2.4 ≈, and maximum hydrogen-bond distances were set to 3.3 ≈. The occupancy of the well-defined solvent, but with a large equivalent temperature factor (larger than 0.8 ≈2), was halved and included in the subsequent refinement cycle. Pairs of well-defined water molecules separated by 2.45 ≈ or less were taken as alternative position. Besides the automatic water-picking procedure, alternative conformations were introduced for waters having definite residual densities or large anisotropy. When modeling the water sites contacting the disordered residues, their occupancies were set to low values to escape the bumping violation generated for atom pairs whose occupancy sum is larger than 1.1. The positions of the hydrogen atoms placed on protein atoms were automatically calculated according to the established geometric criteria rather than being placed into the FO-FC maps. Almost all the hydrogen atoms were placed to be chemically reasonable. Subsequently, they

were refined with the use of a riding model; that is, the hydrogen coordinates were not directly refined but were reidealized before each refinement cycle. To the hydrogen atoms, the same shifts were applied as to their host atoms. Isotropic temperature factors for hydrogen atoms were set to 1.5 times the equivalent temperature factor of the hydroxyl oxygen, methyl carbon, and the amino group nitrogen, and 1.2 times those of other host atoms. Despite the small scattering factor of the hydrogen atoms, appreciable decreases in both R-factor and Rfree values were observed. These approximate hydrogen structures contained enough valid information, reducing the R-factor and Rfree without increasing the number of parameters to be refined. Most of the hydrogen atoms were identified in the omit map computed with the hydrogen atoms removed from the model. However, the identified hydrogen atoms in the omit map were generally those on backbone atoms and C atoms. After 50 more CGLS cycles, in which additional waters and alternative conformations were introduced, refinement converged to an R-factor of 9.7%, with an Rfree of 13.7%. Subsequent refinement was carried out against all the data, including those previously set aside for the cross-validation analysis, and converged to an R-factor of 10.0% for all reflections between 10.0 and 1.1 ≈ resolutions. Generally, the increased number of the reflection data results in the high accuracy in the model, but it cannot bring on the accuracy if the included reflections have lower qualities. In order to determine the appropriate upper resolution limit, goodness-of-fit (GooF) values were used as a guide. The GooF value, which is defined by the summation of the square differences between observed and calculated diffraction intensities, number of the reflections, and the total number of parameters to refine, shows overall inaccuracy of the model. As a consequence of the GooF calculations after the CGLS refinement with various values as an upper resolution limit, the value of 1.05 ≈ turned out to be proper. Further CGLS refinement cycles, including the addition of water molecules and the introduction of alternative conformation, yielded a current model with an R-factor of 10.3% for the 37,649 reflections between 10.0 and 1.05 ≈ resolution (82.2% complete for range). The final model consists of 958 nonhydrogen atoms (988 sites including the split positions) and 177 solvent atoms (202 sites including the split positions). The largest peak and hole in the difference Fourier synthesis are 0.25 and 0.25 e≈ 3, respectively. After each refinement step, 2FO-FC and FO-FC electron density maps were computed. The molecular modeling program Xfit in the XtalView program suite29 was used on Silicon Graphics workstations for visualizing and rebuilding the model. Summary of the refinement statistics are shown in Table II.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Quality of Electron Density The anisotropic treatment of the atoms resulted in a remarkable quality improvement in the phases. The improvement in the electron density maps mostly concerns the removal of the residual density in the FO-FC map, and the final 2FO-FC map is of excellent quality (Fig. 1). Holes are clearly observed in the Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Pro rings. However, the main-chain atoms at both terminal regions are poorly defined in the density. Side-chain atoms of Gln7, Arg28, Gln47, Phe53, Ser76, Asp78, Lys103, and Lys119 also have poorly defined electron density. Attempts to model alternative conformation for the residues, such as Gln7, Ser76, Asp78, and Lys119, have been successful in the removal of the residual density, but the electron density remains poor. Other residues, whose side-chain atoms have large temperature factors, such as Glu37, Asp43, Asp50, and Lys72, still have unmodeled disorder. The disorder of these atoms might be absorbed by the temperature factors. The high resolution and consequent high quality of the electron density maps allowed us to discriminate between the nitrogen and the carbon atoms of the His residue. The density at the nitrogen atoms is higher than that at the carbon atoms. Similarly, this high quality of the electron density map allows us to discriminate between the nitrogen and the oxygen atoms of the Asn or Gln residues. This represents a useful tool in model building, because the proper orientation of the side-chains of these residues can be determined unambiguously in the electron density. Reliability of the Model When the distribution of the and torsion angles of the current model is illustrated in the form of Ramachand-

ran plots,30,31 no residues except Leu44 fall outside allowed regions. The residue Leu44 is at the i 1 position of the type II -turn, and its unusual backbone conformation is stabilized by the formation of a hydrogen bond between its amide nitrogen and Thr42 hydroxyl oxygen. The reliability of the refined model was quantified by comparison of its geometry to its restraint target values, and also by calculating the estimated standard deviations (ESDs) of the refined parameters. Deviations from the ideal geometry28 were calculated with the X-PLOR,22 and the results are presented in Table II. The deviations from ideality appear larger than those of many other published structures. The reason probably is that we relaxed the restraints because of the high resolution of the data. To obtain ESDs in atomic parameters, the final model described in this study was further refined with SHELXL25 in a blocked matrix least-squares mode with looser restraints. In the blocked matrix least-squares refinement cycle, the protein was split into four overlapping blocks of about 50 residues each, with a 15-residue overlap. Positional and anisotropic displacement parameters were refined in each of these blocks. For solvent molecules, positional and anisotropic displacement parameters were refined simultaneously in one block. Further positional refinement was carried out in an additional block including all atoms in the model. A slight underestimation may arise, because not all off-diagonal elements are included in the blocked matrix, and because the refinement has been done with reference to their target values. However, this error evaluation method is more meaningful and informative than a Luzzati plot.32 From the inversion of the least-squares matrix, mean coordinate errors are estimated at 0.025 ≈ for backbone atoms and at 0.036 ≈ for side-chain atoms, except for partially occupied atoms. The coordinate error is mostly in the range of 0.02 to 0.03 ≈. As we expected, the less accurate residues turned out to be more poorly defined. The correlation coefficients between coordinate errors and equivalent temperature factors are 0.86 and 0.94 for main-chain and sidechain atoms, respectively. The high backbone inaccuracy concerns both terminal regions and loop regions. Besides side-chain atoms of

both terminal regions, those of Arg28, Asp43, Gln47, Asp50, Phe53, Lys72, Lys93, Lys103, and Gln116 have large coordinate errors. Partially occupied atoms of the residues in multiple conformations are generally inaccurate. For those of Thr59, Ser82, Ser86, and Ser109, this inaccuracy is especially surprising, because it had not been anticipated by either lower quality or higher thermal motion. Atomic Resolution Structure The overall structure of the S. violaceoruber PLA2, determined previously at a 1.4 ≈ resolution, has revealed that the enzyme has an all-helical structure that contains five -helices and four 310-helical segments.20 Figure 2(a) shows the tertiary structure of the bacterial PLA2 refined at a 1.05 ≈ resolution. The overall structure at an atomic resolution, of course, is almost the same as that refined at a 1.4 ≈ resolution, but we observed a few differences. For example, root-mean-square (RMS) differences between both models were 0.23 ≈ for all protein atoms and 0.10 ≈ for main-chain atoms. Torsion angles above 3 of Arg28, 2 of Asp50, 2 of Lys103, and 2 of Lys119 differed considerably, and Ile84 C 1 and Lys93 C shifted more than 2 . All Class I/II PLA2s produced by eukaryote have an antiparallel -sheet composed of two strands together, with -helices accounting for 50% of the overall structure. For example, Figure 2(b) shows that the bovine pancreatic PLA2 has five -helices, three 310-helical segments, and an antiparallel -sheet.10 This enzyme, which contains seven disulfide bonds, has a catalytic dyad formed between His48 and Asp99, and a hydrogen-bonding network extended from catalytic residues to the surface loop through the N-terminal amino group. A calcium-binding site is formed by the Asp49 carboxylate and the backbone carbonyls, which are in the calcium-binding loop.33 The eukaryotic PLA2 also has a hydrophobic channel to accommodate the substrate during catalysis and an interfacial-binding surface located around the entrance of the hydrophobic channel. The interfacial-binding surface is located on the upside in Figure 2(b), which comprises the residues in the

Secondary structures such as -helix, 310-helix, and -strand are shown in red, orange, and blue, respectively. The residues from Gln30 to Tyr36 in the prokaryotic PLA2 form two 310-helical segments. Disulfide bonds are indicated by yellow, and the calcium(II) ion is represented by a green sphere. Because the S. violaceoruber PLA2 refined at atomic resolution binds no calcium(II) ion, we fitted the ion on the position based on the structural information of its calcium(II) ion-bound form determined previously.20 Invariant residues forming the catalytic dyad and ligating to the calcium(II) ion and the residues directly interacting with the catalytic site are shown by cyan.

N- and C-terminal regions, helix B, calcium-binding loop, and surface loop. As shown in Figure 2, the residues from Leu44 to Cys45, Phe57 to Ala73, and Asn80 to Val95 in the tertiary structure of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 [Fig. 2(a)] take the same orientation as those from Tyr28 to Cys29, Leu41 to Lys57, and Phe94 to Val109 in that of the bovine pancreatic PLA2 [Fig. 2(b)], respectively. Although the bacterial PLA2 has only two disulfide bonds, the functional sites are unambiguously present, as seen in the bovine pancreatic PLA2. A catalytic dyad of the bacterial enzyme is formed between His64 and Asp85, and the hydrogen-bonding network is extended from catalytic residues to the Cterminal region. The calcium-binding site is formed by Asp65 carboxylate in the 3-helix, and Asp43 carboxylate and Leu44 carbonyl in the long loop. The hydrophobic channel is extended from the catalytic site to the external surface, which is indicated on the upper side in Figure 2(a). This surface is formed by the residues in the 5-helix and the following C-terminal region, long loop, and connecting region between 3- and 4-helices, and is expected to be the interfacial-binding site. The structural similarity between both PLA2s is limited to the two long antiparallel -helices containing the residues forming the catalytic and calcium-binding sites, a part of the loop region including one carbonyl oxygen ligating to the calcium(II) ion and one disulfide bond covalently connecting the catalytic and calcium-binding sites. A two-stranded -sheet, commonly found in the Class I/II PLA2s, is absent in the S. violaceoruber PLA2. No three-dimensional counterparts for the Nterminal domain in the S. violaceoruber PLA2 exist in the Class I/II PLA2s. Although the C-terminal 5-helix of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 corresponds to the N-terminal -helix of the Class I/II PLA2s, its orientation is the opposite.

Judging from their poor structural similarity, the S. violaceoruber PLA2 might be evolved from an ancestor different from that of the Class I/II PLA2s. Disordered Structures Alternative conformations were modeled for the residues that still had discrete difference peaks after the anisotropic treatment. This resulted in the occurrence of split positions for part of the side-chain of nine residues. For all the split positions except Ser82 O , two alternative conformations were introduced. For Ser82 O , three alternative conformations were modeled. Discrete disorders of these residues are not surprising, because they are all exposed to the solvent region and make less contact with other residues than do the interior residues. In four of nine side-chains that we built in alternative conformations, the C atoms have significantly diverged. Splitting of their backbone coordinates would be required to improve the geometry at their C atoms. The 1.4 ≈ model contains what are now major conformation atoms for Thr59, Ser76, Asp78, Ser86, Ser109, and Lys119. The Ser82 conformation, observed at a 1.4 ≈ resolution, exhibits the second major conformation in the atomic resolution model. The atomic resolution structure of bovine pancreatic PLA2 has shown that approximately 30% of the total amino acid residues take alternative conformations.10 The disordered residues predominantly locate on the interfacialbinding surface. This observation implies the significance of these residues for the first catalytic process, that is, for binding to the phospholipid interface. It is interesting that a Lys119 residue in the bacterial PLA2 is disordered [Fig. 3(b)]. The Lys119a amino group forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate of Asp85, forming a catalytic dyad, via a water molecule. However, the

These figures were produced by the program ORTEP-III.35 Thermal ellipsoids are drawn with 15% probability.

Lys119b amino group cannot form such a salt bridge. Although the 1.4 ≈ crystallographic study20 has suggested that the Lys119 side-chain is well ordered and contributes to a stable conformation of the catalytic site by forming one water-mediated salt bridge, the atomic resolution analysis clearly reveals that a catalytic hydrogen-bonding network is unstable. The indole rings of both Trp112 conformers have close contacts with symmetric molecules; therefore, the space available in the crystal structure is insufficient for conformational change. Thus, it is natural that the disorder of Trp112 is an example of static disorders, which derived from the conformational heterogeneity rather than the thermal motion. As suggested in a review concerning

pancreatic PLA2,33 the binding of the enzyme to the phospholipid interface is likely governed by the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the interfacialbinding surface of the enzyme and the phospholipid interface. Moreover, the bovine pancreatic PLA2 refined at atomic resolution shows that the residues on the interfacialbinding surface, such as Trp3, Asn6, Glu17, Leu19, Leu20, Leu31, Val65, and Lys116, have disordered structures.10 The Trp112 residue of S. violaceoruber PLA2 is only one hydrophobic residue having disordered conformations. It is located on the putative interfacial-binding surface that surrounds the opening of the hydrophobic channel. In addition to Trp112, hydrophobic residues, such as Phe53 and Ile120, which have large temperature factors, are also

Atomic fluctuations in the bovine pancreatic PLA2 may be derived from heterogeneity rather than the thermal motion, because its structure was determined at a freezing temperature (100 K). However, the molecular mobility, as seen in the backbone of the S. violaceoruber PLA2, can be observed even in that of the bovine PLA2.

located on the interfacial-binding surface. These residues seem to be useful for interfacial binding by penetrating their side-chains into the lipid, as suggested for Trp3 of bovine pancreatic PLA2,34 and are unstable in the absence of phspholipid interface. Thermal Motion The vibrations of atoms within their densities indicated by the anisotropic temperature factors are discussed in this section. Anisotropic temperature factors are expressed with six parameters enabling the representation of the atomic motion in a thermal ellipsoid. Therefore, the analysis of the anisotropic temperature factors is expected to provide information on the magnitude of thermal motion, as well as direction of the movement. The backbone structure, refined with the anisotropic displacement parameters, is almost the same as that of the intermediate structure refined with the isotropic ones. The use of anisotropic displacement parameters did not significantly affect the atomic coordinate. The coordinate difference was mostly less than 0.1 ≈ when the C atoms of two models were superimposed by the least-squares method. On the other hand, side-chain coordinates are much more changed, especially on the surface of the molecule. To compare the magnitude of atomic thermal motion, the equivalent temperature factor (Ueqv) was calculated as the average of three eigenvalues of the tensor of the anisotropic temperature factor. It is noteworthy that the Ueqv values are significantly larger than the isotropic temperature factor (Uiso) obtained in the X-PLOR22 refinement. The average Ueqv values are 0.115 ≈2 for backbone atoms and 0.140 ≈2 for all protein atoms except partially occupied atoms, whereas the corresponding Uiso is 0.105 ≈2 and 0.117 ≈,2 respectively. The difference between Ueqv and Uiso is prominent for atoms with a large anisotropy in the thermal motion. Furthermore, atoms having a large difference between Ueqv and Uiso correspond well to those showing large positional changes as a result of anisotropic refinement. Therefore, it is clear that the isotropic model cannot fully cover the electron density distribution. Anisotropic thermal motion of two parts in the current model is drawn by ORTEP35 representation with 15% possibility. One is a region including the residues Ser41 to Asp50 in the long loop and its surroundings [Fig. 3(a)], and the other is the C-terminal region and its adjacent residues [Fig. 3(b)]. These two regions are shown to have large conformational differences between the calcium-free and -bound forms of the crystal structure,20 and are thus expected to have large local motion. From visual inspections, the thermal motion of the main-chain atoms is relatively small and isotropic, whereas the side-chain atoms show a large and anisotropic thermal motion. Moreover, the thermal displacements are relatively large perpendicularly to the bonding direction. Figure 4(a) shows the 50%-thermal ellipsoids of the C atoms in S. violaceoruber PLA2. The thermal motion of atoms near the center of the molecule is small and rather isotropic, whereas the motion is larger and more anisotropic for the atoms on the surface of the molecule. On the other hand, the 50%-thermal ellipsoids of the C atoms in

Rigid-Body Motion Protein molecules in the crystalline state are mostly exposed to the bulk solvent, and relatively weak interaction is involved in contacts among protein molecules. Consequently, it is plausible that protein molecules apparently behave as a rigid body in the crystal. The local motion of atoms or groups is affected by the interaction with structurally adjacent atoms or groups in their own protein molecule, or in the symmetry-related protein molecule or adjacent solvent molecules. Side-chain groups near the surface have larger mobility than those buried inside the molecule. In contrast, the motion of the main-chain group is limited to the torsional rotations with and angles and also restricted by hydrogen bonds in the formation of secondary structure. Therefore, to estimate the rigid-body motion of the protein molecule, quantitative analysis is applied to the main-chain atoms, because the thermal motion of side-chain atoms may be more influenced by the local motion than that of the main-chain atoms. The TLS (rigid-body motion in terms of translation, libration, and screw motions) model36 has been applied to analyze rigid-body motion. In this study, therefore, we subjected the TLS model for analysis of the rigid-body motion of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 using the obtained anisotropic temperature factors. To compare the molecular motion between prokaryotic and eukaryotic PLA2s, whose structures are completely different, we also tried to apply the TLS model to the bovine pancreatic PLA2 previously refined at atomic resolution.10 In this study, to construct the TLS model to estimate the rigid-body motion of the bovine pancreatic PLA2, we used the anisotropic temperature factor deposited in the PDB. When a molecule is in the rigid-body motion, each anisotropic displacement parameter of atoms (Uij) is expressed as a linear function of three tensors: translation (T), libration (L), and screw (S) motions,

where Gijkl and Hijkl are given in a study by Schomarker and Trueblood.36 Tensors of T, L, and S were determined by the least-squares method to fit the calculated Uijs to the observed ones of main-chain atoms (N, C , and C). For the S. violaceoruber PLA2, the reciprocal of the ESDs of Uij obtained from the blocked matrix least-squares refinement was used as weight. On the other hand, because the ESDs for the parameters of bovine pancreatic PLA2 are not available in the PDB, a reciprocal of the Ueqv value was adopted as weight. Because the uncertainty in the Uij parameters of an atom has a positive correlation with the magnitude of the thermal motion of the atom, this weight-

ing scheme is considered to be proper. The diagonal term of the S matrix was constrained, as its sum equaled zero. The center of libration was chosen so that the S matrix would be symmetric. The results of TLS analysis are given in Table III. The reliability factor (R), which shows the consistency between the calculated and observed Uijs and how well the displacement parameters of the atoms conform to a rigid-body vibration model, was estimated as follows:

where wij is the weighting factor. The relatively low R-factors of 28.4% for S. violaceoruber PLA2 and 27.4%

for bovine pancreatic PLA2 confirm the results of visual examination of the ORTEP35 representation and show that the displacement parameters of backbone atoms conform well to a rigid-body vibration model. The eigenvalues of the T and L matrices indicate that the translational motion is more isotropic than the librational motion in both cases. Large anisotropy in the libration may be derived from the overall architecture of these proteins, which deviate from that of globular protein. In fact, the molecular libration is closely related to the moment of inertia of the molecule. The matrix elements of the S tensor are not significantly larger than their ESD values, and the contribution of the screw motion is very small.

cal The observed Ueqv values and calculated Ueqv values obtained by the TLS method are plotted against the residue number in Figure 5. The similarity in the plot between the observed and calculated Ueqvs suggests again that the motion of the whole molecule as a rigid body largely contributes to that of the individual atoms in the crystal structure of the two distinct PLA2s. However, a considerable deviation occurs between the observed and calculated Ueqvs at the limiting regions. For the S. violaceoruber PLA2, residues Ala1 to Ala3 at the N-terminus, residues Asp43 to Pro52 in the long loop, residues Ala74 to Ala79 in the connecting region between the 3- and 4-helices, residues Thr97 to Tyr99 in the connecting region between 4- and 5-helices, and residues Phe121 to Gly122 at the C-terminus, exhibit considerably larger thermal motions than the evaluation from the TLS model [Fig. 5(a)]. On the other hand, in bovine pancreatic PLA2, residues Pro18 to Asn24 in the helix B, residues Leu31 to Gly33 in the calcium-binding loop, residues Lys53 to Leu58 at the C-terminus of helix C, residues Asp66 to Pro68 in the surface loop, residues Cys77 to Glu81 in the connecting region between two -strands, and residues Pro110 to Cys123 at the C-terminus, concern the higher fluctuation derived from heterogeneity [Fig. 5(b)]. These regions are assumed to have large local motion and to be flexible, especially in solution. In addition, residues Pro18 to Leu20, Phe22 to Tyr25, Gly30 to Gly33, and Asp66 of bovine pancreatic PLA2 have discrete disordered conformations in the backbone structure. Therefore, we expected the fluctuations of these residues to be larger, assuming that they were in single conformations.

state. Because of a simple least-squares fitting, the TLS calculation is affected by both internal and external motions. Therefore, the contributions of both motions to each atomic motion of C atoms were estimated by the following equations, as described by Harata et al.7,8:

Internal Motion and Implication for Catalytic Function The protein motion in the crystalline state is separated into internal and external motion.37 The internal motion, which is related to the protein function, includes the local motions of atoms and groups, whereas the external motion is treated as the rigid-body movement of the molecule and considered to be the special event for each crystalline

where kL and kT are the coefficients determining the contribution of the librational and translational motions, ext int respectively. To estimate kL and kT, Uij and Uij were calculated by changing kL and kT, and these values were determined to satisfy the following two conditions, namely, int that the Uij tensor has three positive eigenvalues, and ext that the contribution of Uij to Uij, which is evaluated by ext the ratio of the mean of the three eigenvalues of an Uij tensor to that of an Uij tensor, becomes maximum. For the S. violaceoruber PLA2, kL and kT were determined to be 0.483 and 0.472, respectively, and the external motion was estimated to be 47.9% of Ueqv in magnitude. In contrast, for the bovine pancreatic PLA2, kL and kT were 0.686 and 0.344, respectively, and the contribution of the external motion was estimated to be 59.8% of Ueqv. The internal motion of the C atoms in each PLA2 is drawn by ORTEP35 representation, as shown in Figure 6. Some local structures having large thermal motion are more clearly shown ext in the structure represented by Uij than in the structure with the observed temperature factors (Fig. 4). It is known that the mobility of protein molecules is related to their biologic activity and that the protein changes their structures by interactions with substrate, ligands, and other proteins. However, relatively little is known about the dynamic state of the protein itself in the atomic scale. We calculated the internal motion of two structurally distinct PLA2s by subtracting external motion from the observed temperature factors and discussed the relationship of the atomic mobility to the biologic function. Figure 6(b) shows a high flexibility in the main-chain atoms of residues Pro18 to Tyr25 in the helix B and its

adjacent region, residues Gly30 to Gly33 in the calciumbinding loop, residues Lys56 to Ser60 at the C-terminus of helix C and N-terminus of helix D, residues Asp66 to Pro68 in the surface loop, residues Ser78 to Glu81 in the connecting region between two -strands, and residues Lys113 to Cys123 at the C-terminal region of the bovine pancreatic PLA2, as indicated by large internal motion or disordered conformation. Interestingly, apart from the residues Ser78

to Glu81, these residues are predominantly located at the flat interfacial-binding surface that surrounds the opening of the hydrophobic channel. The clusters in the N-terminal helix A and the residues Tyr69 to Asn72 in the latter part of the surface loop were also estimated as parts of the interfacial-binding site,33 and they exhibit flexibility when observed by the NMR method,19 whereas their backbone atoms show moderate internal motion. As described previ-

ously,16 this may be due to the preferential crystallization of one protein conformer, in which the hydrogen-bonding network extended from the catalytic site is completely formed. There is also a possibility that the structure of bovine pancreatic PLA2 might be altered under the frozen condition. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 6(a), the backbone atoms in residues Ala1 to Asp4 at the N-terminal region, residues Ser31 to Ala35 including two helical segments, residues Asp43 to Gly54 in the long loop, residues Lys72 to Ala79 in the connecting region between 3- and 4-helices, residues Thr97 to Tyr99 in the connecting region between 4- and 5-helices, and residues Lys119 to Gly122 at the C-terminal region of S. violaceoruber PLA2 have large internal motions. In these, the residues Asp43 to Gly54, Lys72 to Ala79, and Lys119 to Gly122 are located at the putative interfacial-binding surface that

surrounds the opening of the hydrophobic channel. In addition, the residues Ala1-Asp4 and Ser31-Ala35 are nearly placed on the extended plane from the interfacialbinding surface. Although the clusters in the 5-helix are also estimated as a part of the interfacial-binding site, their backbone atoms are unexpectedly stabilized, probably due to the hydrogen-bonding network extended from the catalytic site to the C-terminus of the 5-helix. In contrast, following C-terminal region up from the residue Lys119, which also participates in the hydrogen-bonding network, is not completely stabilized [Fig. 3(b)]. Interestingly, although the bacterial PLA2 has strikingly different architecture than the bovine pancreatic enzyme, the interfacial binding sites of both PLA2s are flexible, suggesting that the internal motion is important for both to bind the phospholipid interface and to move on

PROKARYOTIC PHOSPHOLIPASE A2

the interface by the scooting mode.38,39 Furthermore, we found that a part of the calcium(II) ion-binding sites in both PLA2s, each of which is located at the interfacialbinding surface, is flexible; that is, the calcium-binding loop of the bovine pancreatic PLA2 and the long loop of the S. violaceoruber PLA2, which include the residues contributing to the calcium(II)-ion ligation, have unstable conformations. This observation seems to be related to the fact that both PLA2s coordinate the calcium(II) ion with relatively lower affinities (mM), and the concentration of the free calcium(II) ion regulates the catalytic activities. Because the current structure of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 is a calcium(II) ion-free form, the flexibility in the long loop may be caused by the lack of the calcium(II) ion. In fact, although the Asp43 carboxylate having large thermal motion interacts with the Arg69 guanidino group in the current structure [Fig. 3(a)], such a salt bridge is lost in the calcium-bound form refined at a 1.6 ≈ resolution,20 and the Asp43 carboxylate has a conformational change to ligate to the calcium(II) ion. Furthermore, the residues Cys45 to Ala48 in the long loop form a type-II -turn in the calcium-bound model, in which the carbonyl oxygen of Thr46 forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule ligating to the calcium ion, whereas they form a type-I -turn in the current calcium(II) ion-free model [Fig. 3(a)]. Therefore, the conformational changes may be caused by the introduction of the calcium ion. Regrettably, we cannot estimate the detailed thermal motion in the presence of the calcium(II) ion because of the lower resolution. However, it is more likely that the long loop is also flexible when bound to the calcium(II) ion, because the corresponding region of bovine PLA2 is unstable in the presence of the ion. The flexibility in the structure of the S. violaceoruber PLA2, determined at a physiologic temperature is mainly derived from the thermal motion, whereas that of the bovine pancreatic PLA2, determined at freezing temperature, is derived from the heterogeneity. However, we found that the residues with large flexibility in the S. violaceoruber PLA2 have almost the same distribution as those in the bovine pancreatic PLA2, suggesting the existence of a common catalytic mechanism conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic PLA2s, each of which has backbone structure distinguishable from the other. This implies the possibility that the molecular mobility estimated at the freezing temperature is comparable to that estimated at the physiologic condition; that is, the regions having large thermal motion at a physiologic temperature may exhibit a high conformational heterogeneity even at the freezing temperature. Difference of Flexibility Observed Between X-ray and NMR Analyses In the NMR analysis, in general, the flexibility of the region is represented by the large positional RMS value when several acceptable conformers in the term of theoretical energy and experimental constraints of distance and angle are superimposed. The advantage of NMR analysis is to gain insight into the drastic atomic mobility in the long-time scale; however, the disadvantage is that the structural quality is lower than that obtained by crystallog-

raphy because of the relatively small number of data. In the X-ray analysis, the flexibility of the region can be shown by the presence of disordered conformations or large temperature factors. A disordered conformation partially indicates the atomic mobility in a long-time scale. However, temperature factors are related with rather small fluctuations, which could be simulated in a shorttime scale by molecular dynamics. Furthermore, drastic mobility in the long-time scale is generally difficult to obtain from X-ray analysis because the preferential crystallization of one protein conformer does occur. We have previously determined two NMR structures of the calcium(II) ion-bound and -free forms of S. violaceoruber PLA2.11 These NMR structures are useful for evaluating the certainty of the temperature factor analysis in crystalline state. In this study, we employ the NMR structure of the calcium(II) ion-free form to compare with the 1.05 ≈ crystal structure, because the structural reliability of the calcium(II) ion-free form, which we determined using a larger number of Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data than the calcium(II) ion-bound form, is obviously higher than that of the calcium-bound form. Anisotropic displacement parameters were calculated based on the multiple conformer ensemble obtained by NMR analysis as follows:
NMR Uij

ri

ri rj

rj ,

where ri is the i-coordinate of an atom in one conformer, ri is its mean value over all conformers, and i and j are x, y, or z. Figure 7(a) shows the ORTEP35 representations, which indicate the fluctuation of C atoms in the calcium(II) ion-free bacterial PLA2 estimated by NMR analysis. We can see the molecular motion more easily by the averaged NMR structure with Uij than the simple superposition of the conformer ensemble. In addition, the molecular motion, estimated from NMR analysis, includes the internal motion but not the rigid-body motion. Because a protein molecule can move more freely in solution and change the structure more than it could in crystal, the magnitudes of NMR int Uij are larger than those of Uij from X-ray analysis [Fig. NMR 7(b)]. The average and standard deviation of Ueqv for all 2 122 C atoms are 0.170 and 0.407 ≈ , respectively, whereas int those of Ueqv are 0.060 and 0.033 ≈2, respectively. It can be considered that the flexibility of the local structures is more emphasized in solution [Fig. 7(a)] than in the crystalline state [Fig. 6(a)]. However, the NMR analysis indicates that the Ala1 to Ala3, Ser31 to Glu37, Gln47 to Pro52, Ala74 to Ala79, Thr100 to Glu102, and Ile120 to Gly122 residues have larger fluctuations. This observation is nearly consistent with that from crystallographic analysis and suggests that the interfacial-binding surface is highly flexible, both in solution and in crystalline state. Overall, the regions having large mobility in the long-time scale are suggested to be unstable even in the crystalline state, in which the molecules take the structure of one conformer and their molecular motions may be prevented by the interactions with the symmetrically related molecules.

Catalytic Site and Surrounding Hydrogen-Bonding Network Observed at Atomic Resolution The catalytic residues of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 are His64 and Asp85 [Fig. 8(a)]. Wat260, which forms a hydrogen bond with His64 N 1, is inferred to attack nucleophilically the carbonyl carbon of the substrate.

Asp85, which forms a hydrogen bond with His64 N 2, presumably neutralizes a positive charge of His64 created by the ester-bond cleavage during catalysis. To investigate the His64 protonation-state, an omit-map was computed under the condition that the His64 H 1 and H 2 were removed. To avoid model bias resulting from

potential overrefinement, five CGLS minimization cycles were performed. As shown in Figure 8(b), the difference Fourier peaks close to N 1 and N 2 atoms were clearly observed, suggesting that His64 is protonated at the crystallization conditions adjusted at pH 6. The current structure is enzymatically an inactive form, because His64 cannot abstract the proton from the water molecule. Significantly, the S. violaceoruber PLA2 possesses enzymatic activity at pH 6.11 These paradoxical observations may be explained as follows: In the current structure, less well-defined water molecules fill the vacant space around the His64 N 1. Because of the interactions with these less rigid waters, the pKa value of His64 may be close to the value of histidine in solution. If the substrate and the calcium(II) ion bind to a catalytic site, most of these waters around His64 are eliminated, and the environment of the catalytic site becomes more hydrophobic. This would sequentially cause the lowering of the His64 pKa value, and protonation-state of His64 may be changed. Thus, it should not be surprising if enzymatic activity is retained at pH 6.

The hydrogen-bonding network extends from the catalytic residue and may help the stabilization of the catalytic residues [Fig. 8(a)]. In the S. violaceoruber PLA2, the Asp85 carboxylate links to the Tyr68 hydroxyl group, the Lys81 amino group, and the Lys119a amino group by the mediation of Wat263. The Lys81 amino group also forms a hydrogen bond with the terminal carboxylate and Val118 carbonyl groups. Also, a salt bridge, mediated by Wat263, is formed between the Lys119a amino group and the terminal carboxylate. It has been shown that the solution structure of the porcine pancreatic PLA2 differs from its crystal structure, and that the N-terminal region and the latter part of the surface loop up from Tyr69 are highly flexible.17 These regions include the residues participating in the catalytic hydrogen-bonding network and the substrate binding. However, the solution structure, complexed with micelles and a competitive inhibitor, shows that these regions have stable conformations and that the catalytic hydrogenbonding network is completely formed,18 as in the case of the crystal structure. From these results, van den Berg et

468

Y. MATOBA AND M. SUGIYAMA

al.16 have concluded that the conformational change is caused by the existence of the aggregated substrates and/or inhibitor, and results in the formation of the complete hydrogen-bonding network to stabilize the catalytic residues and the enhancement of the catalytic activity. This conformational change of the enzyme is considered to be a possible explanation for the phenomenon that the activity of PLA2 on aggregated substrates is much higher than that on monomoleculary dispersed phospholipids, so-called interfacial activation.12,14,15 Such conformational differences between the crystal and solution structures free from the phospholipid interface have also been observed in the bovine pancreatic PLA2 and suggest the interfacial activation caused by the conformational change of the enzyme.19 Unfortunately, the flexibility in the N-terminal region and the latter part of the surface loop could not be detected even by the current analysis of the anisotropic temperature factor in the crystal structure at an atomic resolution,10 although flexibility in the interfacial-binding site was shown except these regions. The unexpected stabilization of these regions in the crystalline state may be due to the preferential crystallization of one protein conformer, resembling the interfacial-activated enzyme. In the crystal structure of the calcium(II) ion-free S. violaceoruber PLA2, the C-terminal region participates in the hydrogen-bonding network extended from the catalytic residues and takes a suitable structure for the interfacial binding to the phospholipid and for the substrate binding during catalysis. However, the region is highly unstable in the NMR structure of both calcium(II) ion-free [Fig. 7(a)] and -bound (data not shown) forms, suggesting the flexibility in the catalytic hydrogen-bonding network.11 These results are almost the same as the observations obtained from the pancreatic PLA2s, because the flexible regions in solution were expected to be a member in the catalytic hydrogen-bonding network and the substrate-binding site from the crystal structure. Thus, we agree with van den Berg et al.16 and think that the difference between the crystal and solution structures is an informative suggestion for the mechanism of the interfacial activation. In the current structure of the calcium(II) ion-free S. violaceoruber PLA2 refined at atomic resolution, analysis of the anisotropic thermal motion [Figs. 5(a) and 6(a)] and the existence of alternative conformation for Lys119 [Fig. 3(b)] indicate some extent of flexibility at the C-terminal region, even in the crystalline state. The catalytic hydrogenbonding network is less rigid than that suggested by the previous crystallographic study,20 but this observation agrees with the crystal structure of the calcium(II) ionbound form20 and the solution structures of both forms.11 The formation of the catalytic hydrogen-bonding network is likely to be derived from the preferential crystallization of one protein conformer resembling the interfacialactivated enzyme. However, in contrast to the results from the pancreatic PLA2, the conformation of the C-terminal region is not essentially rigid in the crystal structure because of the lack of the aggregated substrates. The crystal structure of the calcium(II) ion-bound form of

bacterial PLA20 is further evidence for the essential flexibil2 ity at the C-terminal region, even in the crystalline state. The 1.05 ≈ structure of calcium(II) ion-free bacterial PLA2, in addition to the 1.6 ≈ structure of the calcium(II) ion-bound form, indicates that the catalytic hydrogenbonding network of the S. violaceoruber PLA2 is weaker than that of the bovine pancreatic PLA2. Regardless of strength and weakness in the network connectivity, the interfacial activation, caused as a result of the conformational change, may occur not only for the eukaryotic PLA2s, but also for the prokaryotic PLA2. This may be the common mechanism for all secreted PLA2s. REFERENCES
