The Structure of the Membrane Protein SqualeneÊ Hopene Cyclase at 2.0 A Resolution
K. U. Wendt, A. Lenhart and G. E. Schulz*
È Institut fur Organische Chemie und Biochemie, Albertstr. 21 D-79104, Freiburg im Breisgau Germany Squalene cyclases catalyze a cationic cyclization cascade, which is homologous to a key step in cholesterol biosynthesis. The structure of the enzyme from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius has been determined in a new Ê Ê crystal form at 2.0 A resolution (1 A  0.1 nm) and re®ned to an R-factor of 15.3 % (Rfree  18.7 %). The structure indicates how the initial protonation and the ®nal deprotonation of squalene occur and how the transient carbocations are stabilized. The pathways of the ¯exible educt squalene from the membrane interior to the active center cavity and of the rigid fused-ring product hopene in the reverse direction are discussed. The enzyme contains eight so-called QW-sequence repeats that fortify the a/a-barrels by an intricate interaction network. They are unique to the known triterpene cyclases and are presumed to shield these enzymes against the released enthalpy of the highly exergonic catalyzed reaction. The enzyme is a monotopic membrane protein, the membrane-binding interactions of which are described and compared with those of two prostaglandin-H2 synthase isoenzymes, the only other structurally characterized proteins of this type. In the crystals the membrane-binding regions face each other, suggesting a micelle-type detergent structure between them.

Introduction
Squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC, EC 5.4.99.x) from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius catalyzes a cationic cyclization cascade converting the linear triterpene squalene to the fused ring compounds hopene or diplopterol (Figure 1). These compounds are biosynthetic precursors of a great variety of hopanoids that condense bacterial membranes (Ourisson & Rohmer, 1992). The reaction mechanism of SHC is similar to that of the homologous 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases of eukaryotes that catalyze the key step in cholesterol biosynthesis (Figure 1). The amino acid sequences of the squalene and 2,3-oxidosqualene (triterpene) cyclases are 20 to 26 % identical. They contain ®ve to eight copies of the so-called QW-sequence repeat (Poralla et al., 1994), which is unique for this enzyme class. The highly

complex reaction has been the subject of numerous chemical experiments (Abe et al., 1993). Moreover, the enzymes are the targets for the development of anticholesteremic and antifungal drugs (Abe et al., 1998). The integral membrane protein character of the triterpene cyclases, i.e. the requirement of detergents for solubilization, is well established (Seckler & Poralla, 1986; Balliano et al., 1992). The structure of SHC had been solved at medium resolution (Wendt et al., 1997b). Here, we present the highresolution structure of SHC in a new crystal form that enables us to obtain a detailed description of the active center and the reaction mechanism. Moreover, it provides structural data on the dimer interface, the membrane-binding region, detergentbinding, and the characteristic QW-sequence repeat.

diffracted to medium resolution (Wendt et al., 1997a). A further crystal form B of superior quality was obtained under the same conditions with mutants D376C/C435S and D376C/C50S that were initially prepared for the MIR analysis of crystal form AH . Both mutations are far away from a crystal packing contact. The structure of crystal form B was solved by molecular replacement using the wild-type structure of SHC (Wendt et al., 1997b), and then re®ned against a data set collected at cryogenic temperaÊ tures to 2.0 A resolution (Table 1). Crystal form B belongs to space group P43212 with one SHC dimer in the asymmetric unit. The dimer contains a local 2-fold axis that is 1.7  tilted against the c-axis. The dimer center (fractional coordinates 0.495, 0.501, 0.211) is located almost exactly on a crystallographic 2-fold screw axis along c. If this position were exact and if there were no tilt, the

packing would be P42212 with half the c-axis and one SHC subunit per asymmetric unit. Similar smallish packing differences occurred between the reported crystal form A of the Ê Ê SHC wild-type (P321, a  b  140.7 A, c  81.9 A; H Wendt et al., 1997b) and form A of mutant D376C Ê Ê (P3221, a  b  141.0 A, c  243.8 A). The latter has Ê now been re®ned at a resolution of 2.8 A. The asymmetric unit of crystal form AH contains three SHC subunits that are shifted away from their regular positions in form A, breaking the 3-fold symmetry. The displacements are in the range of 2 Ê to 3 A. The structure of form AH showed no signi®cant difference from the others; therefore, it will not be described further. Throughout the re®nement of crystal form B the non-crystallographic symmetry was tightly restrained except for a total of 53 residues per subunit, which ®nally showed somewhat larger deviations between the subunits than the restrained residues. The overall rmsd Ca, however, was as Ê small as 0.04 A, suggesting that the two asymmetric subunits should be treated as identical, which we do in the following. The quality indicators of the ®nal structure are in the usual range (Table 2). At the chain ends, the residues up to position 7 and residue 631 are not included in the model because they lack electron density. When compared with crystal form A, the visible chain was thus elongated by ®ve residues. Structure description The high-resolution model deviates only slightly from the medium-resolution model of crystal form Ê A. The overall rmsd Ca is 0.5 A, the ÁCa distribution is plotted in Figure 2 together with the B-factor distribution. The largest deviations occur in the mobile region around helix a8, which faces the membrane. The mobilities at the dimer

A mobility-coded chain tracing is given in Figure 3, demonstrating that the central part of the subunit is much more rigid than the surfaces. Interestingly enough, there is a cis-peptide before Asn492 near the active center cavity. Furthermore, there are two peculiar aromatic hydrogen bonds: Trp406-NE1 points vertically towards the indole ring of Trp351 at a vertical distance of Ê 3.2 A, and Trp558-NE1 points in a similar way at the same distance towards Phe616. Three molecules of the detergent C8E4 that is used for crystallization bind in a de®ned manner to each SHC subunit and can therefore be located. One detergent molecule is bound in the large active center cavity where the polar tetraoxyethylene (C8E4) group points to the polar top of the cavity (Figure 4(a)), forming several hydrogen bonds with protein and water atoms (Table 3). The ligand is totally shielded from the bulk solvent. In the reported structure, the catalytic Asp376 at the top of the active center cavity is exchanged for a cysteine (Figure 4(a)). In crystal form A the detergent lauryldimethylaminoxide (LDAO) was bound in a similar manner, with its oxygen at hydrogenbonding distance from the Asp376 of the wild-type enzyme (Wendt et al., 1997b). The second C8E4 molecule is bound in the nonpolar membrane-binding region of SHC, where it occupies a shallow cleft at the channel entrance (Figure 4(b)). It is exclusively bound by non-polar

interactions and may assume multiple conformations in the crystal; its oxygen atoms cannot be located (Table 3). A third C8E4 molecule is bound at the dimer interface where it interacts with both subunits and increases the interface area (Figures 4(c), 5 and 6). The dimeric structure of SHC has been established by gel permeation chromatography (Neumann & Simon, 1986). We were able to verify these data in similar experiments using detergent C8E4 at pH 4.8 (crystallization condition) and at pH 6.0 (maximal activity). The dimeric structure was further con®rmed by the conservation of the dimer contact in all SHC crystal forms and, in addition, by the fact that it is always the largest packing contact (Table 4). The dimer interface Ê Ê amounts to 820 A2 (or 1170 A2, including the two detergent molecules), which is 3.6 % of the surface of one subunit (Figure 5). The interface contains 23 % (Asp, Glu, Lys) residues involved in polar Ê interactions and one hydrogen bond per 103 A2, which is much more polar than oligomer interfaces in general (Table 4). Janin et al. (1988) found in such interfaces only 14 % on average (Asp, Glu, Ê Lys) and one hydrogen bond per 200 A2. With its high polarity the dimer interface rather resembles crystal contacts. It is therefore conceivable that the SHC dimer is of a transient nature. In vivo, the non-polar pockets (which accommodate the two C8E4 molecules) could be occupied by phospholipids, which shield the polar interface center against water and thus promote the associ-

ation. This would link dimerization with the integration of SHC into the membrane. Monotopic membrane binding Integral membrane proteins that submerge from one side into the non-polar part of the phospholipid bilayer without protruding through it (Figure 6(a)) have been classi®ed as ``monotopic'' (Blobel, 1980). Apart from SHC, the currently known spatial structures of this protein class are those of the prostaglandin-H2 synthase isoenzymes-I (Picot et al., 1994) and -II (Kurumbail et al., 1996; Luong et al., 1996). All three proteins are dimeric with large non-polar surface regions surrounding the entrance channels to the deeply buried active centers. Moreover, in all three cases the molecular 2-fold axis is perpendicular to the membrane and it orients the non-polar regions in parallel such that their tendencies to enter the membrane are reinforced (Figures 6 and 7). In the crystal structures of SHC and prostaglandin-H2 synthase-I (Loll et al., 1995) the entrance channels are occupied by detergents C8E4 and b-octylglucoside, respectively (Figure 6). The membrane-binding region of SHC forms a ¯at non-polar plateau (Figure 6(b)), whereas the

membrane-binding regions of both isoenzymes of prostaglandin-H2 synthases form horseshoe-shaped non-polar protrusions (Figure 6(c)) that leave a polar passage for the carboxylate of the substrate arachidonic acid. Such a passage is not required in SHC, because its substrate squalene is entirely nonpolar and therefore submerged in the non-polar membrane interior. The crystal packings of SHC and the prostaglandin-H2 synthases have interesting features in common. In crystal forms A and AH of SHC the paired membrane-binding plateaux of the dimer give rise to rings of non-polar protein surfaces around the crystallographic 3-fold axes (Figure 7(a)). Similar rings are found in the packing of prostaglandin-H2 synthase isoenzyme-I (Figure 7(b)). In crystal form B of SHC (Figure 7(c)) and in the synthase isoenzyme-II (Figure 7(d)) the membrane-binding plateaux of two dimers face each other. In all cases the non-polar patches are close to each other. One must expect the non-polar regions to be covered by hoods formed by the respective detergent. The recurrent juxtaposition of these hoods in the observed crystal packing suggests that appreciable interactions occur between them. It is conceivable that they associate to form a globule reminiscent of an inverse detergent micelle. Since

such a micelle would have some non-polar surface exposed to the polar solvent, we suggest that it is partially covered by a second detergent layer. It would be of interest to check whether such peculiar detergent structures can be established by low-resolution X-ray or neutron diffraction analysis. Reaction mechanism The active center of SHC is located in a large central cavity, depicted in Figure 8. The cationic cyclization cascade is initiated by an acidic group within the cavity and terminated by a base (Figure 1). The ®rst steps may be concerted (Corey et al., 1997a; Jenson & Jorgensen, 1997; Gao et al., 1998). The mechanism of Wendt et al. (1997b) suggests that Asp376, backed up by His451 at the top of the active center cavity, functions as the catalytic acid, whereas a water molecule at the cavity bottom forms the base. The reported structure of crystal form B shows a well-de®ned water molecule at Tyr495-OH. This water molecule was already visible in crystal form A (containing the wild-type Asp376 instead of the cysteine in form B), but was not considered safe because of the limited resolution. It connects Asp376 with Tyr495 in the wild-type enzyme. This arrangement is likely to increase the acidity of Asp376 (Figure 9). Moreover, it explains the reprotonation of Asp376 after turnover. The new proton most probably comes via this water molecule and Tyr495-OH from disordered water in the upper cavity of SHC (Figure 8). This cavity can receive a proton from the bulk water, as the separating salt-bridge Glu454:Arg623 is not a proton barrier.

Moreover, the new crystal form B contains a well-de®ned water network at Gln262, Arg127, Glu45 and Glu93 (Figure 4(a)), which is in a suitable position to polarize the putative water molecule functioning as the catalytic base. The presumed location of this water is indicated in Figure 9. In the crystal structure this position is occupied by the ligated detergent C8E4. The putative catalytic water molecule is connected by a Ê 15 A long narrow channel with the outside. This channel is ®lled with a chain of six hydrogenbonded water molecules. We suggest that the accepted proton is transferred along this water chain to the bulk solvent. For exploring the active center geometry, we used the wild-type structure (crystal form A) and placed a hopene molecule into the cavity with its C-3 atom pointing towards Asp376 at the top where the initial protonation takes place (Wendt et al., 1997b; Corey et al., 1997a). Apart from the mutation D376C the hopene contacting side-chain Ê positions agree within 0.3 A with those of crystal form B. Hopene was then rotated in 10  steps around its longest dimension (axis through atoms C3 and C17) and its contact energy was minimized È using the program XPLOR (Brunger, 1987). This resulted in a narrow distribution around the best position, which is depicted in Figure 9. The model Ê puts the C3 atom at 3.0 A from the proposed catalytic acid Asp376, which is the expected geometry for the initial protonation. Moreover, the two methyl groups at C4 ®t well into the two small pockets accommodating the two N-methyl groups of LDAO in crystal form A. There are no residual clashes with the cavity wall. This indicates that the

detergent LDAO ®ts the headpiece of hopene rather well, explaining why LDAO is a good inhibitor with an association constant of 0.14 mM (Ochs et al., 1990). Several conserved aromatic amino acids are in suitable positions for the stabilization of intermediate carbocations (Figure 9). Such stabilization has been suggested in general terms by Johnson et al. (1987) and directly by Dougherty (1996). Aromatic side-chains as particular stabilizers entered the discussion after sequencing revealed an excessive amount of them (Buntel & Grif®n, 1992). The hopene model indicates that Trp312, Trp489 and Phe365 are well positioned to stabilize the ®rst three cations of the cyclization cascade at atoms C4, C10 and C8 (hopene numbering), respectively. We suggest that Trp169 stabilizes the fourth cation at C13 (hopene) in agreement with experiments showing that the equivalent residue in a 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase was modi®ed by several substrate analogues designed to label at late cyclization steps (Corey et al., 1997b). Phe601 is at an appropriate place to stabilize a cation at C18 (hopene) such that a Markovnikov type 5-exo-ring closure of ring D could happen as discussed by Pale-Grosdemange et al. (1998). A similar process

was suggested for the C-ring closure of the 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases (Corey et al., 1995; Jenson & Jorgensen, 1997). Phe605 could stabilize the cation at C17, which would facilitate the rearrangement to the ®nal six-membered ring D. Phe605 is also well positioned to stabilize the terminal cation at C22 in the 5-exo-cyclization of ring E (Figures 1 and 9). Aromatic residues at positions Trp312, Trp489, Phe365 and Phe601 are conserved in all known squalene and 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase sequences, suggesting that the aromatic cation stabilizations resemble each other up to ring D. Phe605 facilitating E-ring formation, however, is only conserved within the squalene cyclase subgroup that form this ®fth ring, which supports its proposed role. Ê The C22 atom of the hopene model is 5.5 A away from the water network observed in crystal form B. As discussed above, the putative water molecule functioning as the catalytic base can be placed at the expected position (Figure 9) if there is no detergent C8E4. The initial protonation of the carbon ±carbon double bond by a carboxylic acid is unusual. It may be supported by an electrostatic contribution from the environment. The His451 contacting Asp376 is probably protonated and compensates for the developing negative charge at Asp376 in a salt-bridge, which is also stabilized by the water bridge to Tyr495-OH. Asp374 and Asp377 form a Ê short hydrogen bond (2.6 A) and are likely to carry a negative charge that could stabilize a cation at

C10 (hopene). A further electrostatic stabilization could arise from the dipoles of the conserved residues Tyr609 and Tyr612 pointing to the early carbocations (Figure 9). It should be noted that in Figure 9 the residues expected to stabilize the later cations are somewhat too low in relation to the hopene position. This may indicate that the length reduction during squalene cyclization (Figure 1), which amounts to Ê a total of about 6 A when the preformed squalene is compared to hopene, does not necessarily occur by drawing the remaining squalene tail further towards the C3 atom (hopene) at the catalytic acid at the top of Figure 9. Equally well, the C3 atom could move towards the catalytic base at the bottom. In view of the positions of the aromatic residues stabilizing the ®rst ®ve carbocations, we suggest that after E-ring closure hopene is located Ê about 2 A lower than depicted in Figure 9. Educt access and product release The active center cavity is accessible from the membrane interior through a non-polar channel that contains a narrow constriction. The constriction seems mobile enough to permit the passage of the reaction educt squalene if it is in an extended conformation (Figures 3 and 8). The release of the products hopene or diplopterol via the same channel appears to be questionable, because these fused ring compounds are rigid and bulky and require a much larger opening of the channel. An alternative

The LDAO molecule ligated to the wildtype is depicted (broken lines). Hopene was modeled in the wild-type structure of crystal form A (Wendt et al., 1997b). The water molecules (open circles) and their contacting partners are from crystal form B. The displacement of Ê the residues from crystal form A is about 0.3 A from those of form B. The putative water molecule functioning as the ®nal base is a grey circle.

Ê exit through the upper cavity of 400 A3 volume that is depicted at the top of Figure 8 is unlikely, however, because it is separated from the active center cavity by a wall formed by residues Trp312, Asp376, His451, Tyr495 and Tyr612, which have to assume a de®ned conformation for catalysis. An experiment labeling Asp376 (Abe & Prestwich, 1994) presumably involved the conjugated double bond of the applied compound and not the suggested protosteryl cation near ring D, because the latter could reach Asp376 only after opening this wall. A substrate release through the small lower cavity or through the large cavity side arm (Figure 8) is also unlikely because these cavities are lined by rigid structures. We therefore conclude that educt and product pass through the same channel. The required widening of this channel for hopene passage seems possible because it is covered by two mobile loops (Figure 8) that are attached to the membrane, such that membrane ¯uctuations could help moving them. QW-sequence repeat Squalene and 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases share a unique sequence ®ngerprint, the socalled QW-

repeat (Figure 10), with the consensus a-b-x2-3-c-dx3-Q-x2-5-G-x-W with a  (Lys, Arg), b  (Gly, Ala), c  (Phe, Tyr, Trp), and d  (Leu, Ile, Val). It occurs ®ve times in 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases and up to eight times in the squalene cyclases (Poralla et al., 1994; Tippelt et al., 1998). In view of the structure, the repeats should be subdivided into ``front'' regions that are located in outer helices of the a/abarrel domains, and ``core'' regions that form loops with a special conformation (Figure 11). Moreover, the repeats should be extended by adding a ``tail'' region located on the nearest inner barrel-helix (Figures 10 and 11). Residues Q and W stack onto each other. Q forms a hydrogen bond between its NE2 atom and a main-chain oxygen of the front region of the following repeat, whereas W caps the carboxy-terminal end of the a-helical front region of the same repeat. The tail contains a conserved threonine, the OG1 atom of which forms two hydrogen bonds to the main chains of the preceding core region. Core and tail regions of one repeat and the front region of the next repeat form a small non-polar globule with various hydrogen bonds. The QW-repeats connect a-helices in space in a similar manner like another scattered sequence repeat that connects b-propeller blades (Wall et al.,

Squalene-Hopene Cyclase

Figure 10. QW-repeats r1 to r8 of SHC. All front regions are in outer helices of the a/a-barrel, all cores (except r4) assume a characteristic loop conformation, and all tails are in the following inner barrel-helix (Figure 11). The tails always comprise the whole inner helix. The conserved residues are in bold type. The shaded residues participate in the small local non-polar globule.

1995; Sondek et al., 1996). Since there are no resembling features in the four structurally established a/a-barrels of glycosyl hydrolases (Sakon et al., 1997), QW-repeats are not generally required for a/a-barrels. Given their presence in the cyclases, the repeats most likely ful®ll an important function. It has been suggested that they shield the cyclases against the released enthalpy of the highly exergonic reaction (Wendt et al., 1997b). Interestingly enough, the b-subunit of a proteinfarnesyl-transferase (Park et al., 1997) consists of an (a/a)6-barrel that contains glutamine and threonine residues with interactions resembling those of the QW-repeats. This may indicate a distant evolutionary connection between these transferases and the class-II terpenoid synthases, among them SHC (Wendt & Schulz, 1998).

Materials and Methods
Crystallization Production and puri®cation of SHC have been described (Wendt et al., 1997a). Puri®ed SHC was dialyzed overnight against 0.6 % (w/v) C8E4 in bi-distilled water. Crystals were grown at 20  C in hanging drops starting at a protein concentration of 8 mg/ml, 0.3 % (w/v) detergent C8E4 and 50 mM sodium citrate at pH 4.8. The reservoir solution contained 100 mM sodium citrate at pH 4.8. All solutions used during the ®nal dialysis and crystallization were degassed in vacuo and saturated with nitrogen gas to prevent oxidative damage to the protein. Under these conditions double mutants D376C/C50S and D376C/C435S crystallized predominantly in form AH (Wendt et al., 1997a) but also yielded a few tetragonal crystals of form B. These appeared within

Figure 11. Stereo view of the structure consisting of QW-repeat r6 together with the front region of r7. Two outer (red) and one inner (yellow) barrel-helices are depicted with one core region (green, residues drawn out to the Cb atom). Hydrogen bonds are represented by dots. For the core regions, the average deviation of all pairwise compariÊ sons except r4 is 0.23 A, which is around the error limit. The core of r4 forms a long loop that returns to the tryptophan position, which however, carries a phenylalanine (Figure 10).

Squalene-Hopene Cyclase Protein Data Bank accession number The coordinates have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 2SQC and 3SQC.

Data collection and processing All data were collected using an area detector (Siemens, model X-1000) with Cu Ka radiation (Rigaku, model RU200B), and processed with the programs XDS (Kabsch, 1988), SCALA and TRUNCATE (CCP4, 1994). An initial data set was measured from three crystals at Ê room temperature to 2.4 A resolution (no details reported) and used for molecular replacement. The ®nal data set was collected from a single crystal at 100 K using an arti®cial mother liquor (0.3 % (w/v) C8E4, 1.5 M ammonium phosphate, 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.8) and 25 % (v/v) glycerol as cryo-protectant (Table 1). In order to keep the mosaicity low, we gradually increased the glycerol concentration from 0 to 25 % in 5 % steps (two minute soaks). The crystal was mounted in rayon loops (Teng, 1990) and ¯ash-cooled in a nitrogen gas stream (Oxford cryosystems).

Phase determination and refinement The structure of crystal form B was elucidated by molecular replacement using Protein Data Bank entry 1SQC (Wendt et al., 1997b) as a search model in the program AMoRe (CCP4, 1994). The native Patterson map showed a peak with a height of 94 % of the origin peak at fractional coordinates (0.0, 0.0, 0.5). This suggests a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis approximately along the crystallographic c-axis of space group P41,3212, indicating a packing in pseudo-P42212 with half the c-axis. The molecular replacement search included re¯ections of the resÊ olution range between 10 and 3.5 A. The rotational search resulted in a local 2-fold axis with an correlation coef®cient of 18 % (5 % for highest incorrect solution). The translational search yielded two solutions for each of the two enantiomorphic space groups, which were indistinguishable by their R-factors and correlation coef®cients. All four solutions were therefore re®ned with the È program XPLOR (Brunger, 1987) in the resolution range Ê 10 to 2.4 A. The correct solution reached soon an R-factor of 38.9 % whereas the best of the three incorrect solutions converged at an R-factor of 40.2 %. For the ®nal re®nement we used the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) with strong NCS restraints. Individual isotropic B-factors were re®ned in every cycle and the bulk solvent correction of XPLOR È (Jiang & Brunger, 1994) was used throughout. Water molecules were automatically generated using program ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993). After several rounds of water insertion, residual continuous (Fo À Fc) densities were modeled as three C8E4 detergent molecules. For the re®nement of crystal form AH (no details reported) we placed Protein Data Bank entry 1SQC into the asymmetric unit and re®ned with the program È XPLOR (Brunger, 1987) in the resolution range from 20 Ê to 2.8 A. The computation was stopped after two rounds È of torsion angle dynamics (Rice & Brunger, 1994) and constrained B-factor re®nement, resulting in an R-factor of 20.7 % (Rfree 23.5 %). Figures 3 to 5, 8, 9 and 11 were generated with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).
