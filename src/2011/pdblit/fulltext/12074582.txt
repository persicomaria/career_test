Abstract Epiregulin (EPR), a novel member of epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, is a ligand for ErbB-1 and ErbB-4 receptors. The binding a/nity of EPR for the receptors is lower than those of other EGF-family ligands. The solution structure of EPR was determined using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The secondary structure in the C-terminal domain of EPR is di¡erent from other EGFfamily ligands because of the lack of hydrogen bonds. The structural di¡erence in the C-terminal domain may provide an explanation for the reduced binding a/nity of EPR to the ErbB receptors. ß 2003 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Epiregulin (EPR) is a novel growth-regulating ligand belonging to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, which is puri¢ed from conditioned medium of the mouse ¢broblastderived tumor cell line NIH3T3/clone T7 [1,2]. Human EPR is mainly expressed on peripheral blood macrophages, placenta in normal tissues and epithelial tumor cell lines [3]. EPR exhibits bifunctional regulatory properties: it inhibits the growth of some epithelial tumor cells and stimulates the growth of ¢broblasts and various other types of cells [1].

EPR stimulates the proliferation of gastric cells [4] and human keratinocytes [5,6], and it is a factor a¡ecting pancreatic cancer and in£ammatory disease [7,8]. Therefore, EPR plays a critical role in regulating several biological activities. EPR consists of 46 amino acid residues, and the amino acid sequence of EPR exhibited 24^50% amino acid sequence identity with sequences of other EGF-family ligands [1]. EGFfamily ligands act as a trigger for the signal transmission system by binding to the receptors [9]. These receptors are known as ErbB-family receptors, and they consist of four types: ErbB-1, ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. EPR binds to ErbB-1 and ErbB-4 [10^12], and its selectivity for ErbB-family receptor is similar to that for betacellulin (BTC). Jones et al. have reported comparisons of binding speci¢cities and a/nities of EGF-family ligands for ErbB receptors [11]. According to their ¢ndings, the binding a/nities of EGF, transforming growth factor-K (TGF-K), BTC, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), heregulin-K (HRG-K), and -L for each ErbB receptor are high or moderate. On the other hand, binding a/nities of EPR for ErbB receptors are weak. EPR shows the weakest a/nity for both the homodimer and heterodimer of ErbB receptors. Among EGF-family ligands, the tertiary structures of EGF [13], TGF-K [14], the EGF-like domain of HRG-K (HRG-Ke) [15], the EGF-like domain of BTC (BTCe) [16], and HB-EGF [17] have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or X-ray di¡raction. Despite the primary sequence diversity, these tertiary structures are very similar. All EGF-family ligands are composed of N- and C-terminal domains, each of which has a L-sheet. The C-terminal domain is suggested to be involved in the binding of EGF-family ligands to ErbB receptor. For example, the substitution of the highly conserved Arg41 and Leu47 of EGF results in a marked reduction in the a/nity for the EGF receptor, suggesting that these residues are essential for binding to the receptors [18,19]. It has been reported that the substitution of the C-terminal tail of human TGF-K into human EGF results in high-a/nity binding of human EGF to the chicken ErbB-1 [20]. In this study we examine the structure of EPR by NMR spectroscopy and discuss the relation between the binding a/nity and the tertiary structure. The report presented here may provide crucial information for elucidating the detailed

233 40 lowest-energy structures of the ¢nal iteration. All structural calculations were performed on a LINUX workstation. Validation of the ¢nal structures was con¢rmed using PROCHECK-NMR [38]. Ramachandran plot analysis showed that all of the residues have backbone dihedral angles in the allowed regions of the P, i plot. The structures were displayed using MOLMOL [29]. 2.4. Comparison with other EGF-family proteins To compare the structural properties of EPR with those of other EGF-family proteins, we used the coordinate data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The secondary and tertiary structures of EPR were compared with those of human TGF-K (the PDB accession code is 2TGF) [14], mouse EGF (1EGF) [13], HRG-Ke (1HAF) [15], HBEGF (1XDT) [17], and human BTCe (1IOX) [16]. 2.5. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy CD spectra of EPR were measured using a JASCO J-805 spectrometer (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a 1-mm quartz cell. The protein concentrations for CD measurements were 155 WM. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm. The temperature of the measuring cell was maintained at 25C by circulating water. Bu¡er solutions contained 250 mM phosphate (pH 6.0 or 7.0) or 250 mM glycine (pH 3.4).

mechanisms underlying binding a/nity of the EGF-family ligand for ErbB-family receptor. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample preparation of EPR The DNA fragment encoding EPR was inserted into the expression vector, pET32a (Novagen), and EPR was expressed as a soluble form of thioredoxin (Trx)-His-tag fusion proteins. The Trx-His-tag-fusion EPR was expressed in AD494(DE3), which is a Trx reductase-de¢cient Escherichia coli strain. The soluble fraction was puri¢ed by Histag a/nity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). The bu¡er of the protein solution eluted was changed to EKMax reaction bu¡er (Invitrogen) using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EKMax (Invitrogen) enzyme was added at a ¢nal ratio of 0.5 units per 1 mg of protein and incubated at 33C for 12 h. Finally, the cleavage products were puri¢ed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The puri¢ed EPR was identi¢ed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS: Voyager) and N-terminal amino acid analysis (Shimadzu PPSQ-21). The biological activity of the puri¢ed EPR was con¢rmed by growth inhibitory activity for A431 [1]. A431 cells were plated in 96-well dishes at a density of 1.5U103 cells/ well in the medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37C for 24 h. Then, EPR was added at various concentrations [21]. After 3 days, TetraColor ONE (Seikagaku Corporation), which is a reagent for modi¢ed MTT assay, was added to each well, and, after 4 h of incubation, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. 2.2. 1H NMR spectroscopy The EPR sample was dissolved at a ¢nal concentration of 1.5 mM in 300 Wl of either 90% H2 O/10% D2 O or 100% D2 O. The pH was adjusted to 3.4 to observe amide protons by decreasing the hydrogen^ deuterium (H^D) exchange rates. The NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer. The majority of NMR spectra were recorded at 30C, and some experiments were carried out at 40C to resolve ambiguities. Double quantum ¢ltered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) [22] spectra were collected at 30C. Total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) [23] spectra were obtained at 30C and 40C with a mixing time of 80 ms. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) [24] spectra were collected at 30C and 40C with a mixing time of 100 and 150 ms. The TOCSY and NOESY spectra at 30C and pH 7.0 were measured and the 1 H resonances were partially assigned. However, the quality of NMR spectra at pH 7.0 was not good enough to solve the solution structure of EPR. All NMR data were processed and analyzed on a LINUX workstation using NMRpipe1.8 [25] and PIPP 4.3.2 [26] software. 2.3. Structural calculations The interproton distance restraints were calibrated using nuclear Overhauser e¡ect (NOE) peak intensities. The P angle restraints were applied using spin^spin coupling constants 3 JNHKH and chemical shift index (CSI) [27] analysis data. The 3 JNHKH coupling constants were determined from a high digital resolution DQF-COSY spectrum. Residues with 3 JNHKH s 10 Hz were constrained to P = 3120 þ 40. When 3 JNHKH was not obtained, the P angle was constricted on the basis of CSI data, i.e. P = 360 þ 30 for the residue with CSI = 1. The Backbone P angle restraints were applied for 33 residues on the basis of 3 JNHKH and ¢ve residues on the basis of CSI. The backbone amide H^D exchange experiment was performed to identify the hydrogen bond donors forming secondary structures. Residues for which the amide proton exchange rates are su/ciently slow were identi¢ed in the NOESY spectrum of a freshly prepared solution of EPR in D2 O. For each donor, its acceptor was determined on the basis of the preliminary calculated structure. The hydrogen-bonding restraints were included only in the regions of identi¢ed secondary structure î î and set to be 2.00 þ 0.20 A for NH^O distances and 3.00 þ 0.30 A for N^O distances for regular secondary structures. This information about the hydrogen bonds was used to calculate the tertiary structure. During the initial calculation stage, 50 starting structures were calculated from an extended conformation of EPR using a simulated annealing (SA) protocol in X-PLOR 3.1 [28]. The structural re¢nement was carried out by starting with the 40 lowest-energy structures of the previous iteration. The energy-minimized average structure of EPR was calculated using the modi¢ed SA protocol by starting with the

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Chemical shift assignments of EPR The chemical shift assignment of EPR was carried out using the sequential assignment procedure [30]. The sequential assignment was achieved by a combination of TOCSY and NOESY spectra acquired at 30C and 40C. The 1 H resonance of all of the main chain atoms, except for the amide proton of the N-terminal Val1 , and most of the side chain atoms of EPR at pH 3.4 were unambiguously assigned. The assignment of

Structural calculation of EPR The solution structure of EPR at 30C and pH 3.4 was calculated using NMR-derived 603 experimental restraints. A total of 556 distance restraints were obtained from the NOESY spectrum. The distance restraints can be subdivided into 297 intraresidual, 128 sequential, 46 medium-range, and 85 long-range restraints. The 38 dihedral P angle restraints and nine hydrogen bond restraints were used as additional restraints for the calculations.

atoms of the converged region (Thr4 -Phe44 ). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone atoms evaluated for the converged region of the 40 structures against the mean î structure was 0.97 þ 0.25 A for the backbone atoms and î for all non-hydrogen atoms. The RMSD of 1.51 þ 0.27 A the backbone atoms evaluated for the N-terminal (Thr4 Glu33 ) and C-terminal (Val34 -Phe44 ) domains are 0.90 þ 0.28 î and 0.48 þ 0.21 A, respectively (Table 1). The RMSD of the L-sheet comprised of strand-2 and -3 in the N-terminal doî main (Gly17 -Cys32 ) is 0.37 þ 0.11 A. Fig. 2B shows a ribbon drawing of the energy-minimized average structure of EPR. Secondary structures were determined using the program MOLMOL [29]. EPR is comprised of three strands (strand-1, -2, and -3 are composed of Thr4 Lys5 , Gly17 -Leu22 , and Gln27 -Cys32 , respectively) and one

HRG-Ke, and HB-EGF, we found a common structural property in the L-sheet that consists of strand-2 and -3, corresponding to Gly17 -Leu22 and Gln27 -Cys32 of EPR, and the short turn structure between the two strands (Fig. 3A). In addition, the tertiary structure of this region of EPR is similar to the corresponding regions of other ligands (Fig. 3B). Another interesting similarity between EPR and other EGF-family ligands is that EPR, BTCe, and HRG-Ke adopt a helical turn in this region of Ser8 -Met10 in EPR (Fig. 3A). Tertiary structures of this region are similar to each other among these three proteins (Fig. 3B). EGF, TGF-K, and HB-EGF do not form the helical turn in this region. In particular, the structures in the N-terminal domain are similar between EPR

and BTCe, which are the ligands for ErbB-1 and ErbB-4 [10^12]. 3.4. The structure of the C-terminal domain of EPR Although the overall structure of the N-terminal domain of EPR is similar to those of other EGF-family ligands, there is a marked di¡erence in the structure of the C-terminal domain between EPR and other EGF-family ligands. The C-terminal portions of EGF, TGF-K, BTCe, HRG-Ke, and HB-EGF form an antiparallel L-sheet. However, the C-terminal portion of EPR does not form a complete L-sheet structure (Figs. 2 and 3). Montelione et al. [13] have reported the H^D exchange rate of backbone amide protons of EGF. The back-

bone amide protons of Tyr37 , Ser38 , Cys42 , Gln43 and Thr44 of EGF exchanged slowly with deuterium in the H^D exchange experiment and the interstrand NOEs were observed in the C-terminal L-sheet of EGF [39]. Only one slowly exchanging amide proton was observed in the C-terminal domain of EPR in the amide H^D exchange experiment (Fig. 1) and there was no NOE between two segments (Tyr36 -Thr37 and His43 -Phe44 ) in the C-terminal domain of EPR (data not shown). These results suggest that conformation in this region of EPR is not supported by hydrogen bonds and that the lack of hydrogen bonds is responsible for the incomplete L-sheet structure in the C-terminal domain of EPR. However, the C-terminal domain adopts a L-sheet-like structure according to 3 JNHKH and CSI analysis (Fig. 1). Therefore, EPR slightly di¡ers from other EGF-like ligands in the conformation of the C-terminal domain. Although EPR is a ligand that binds to the homodimer of ErbB-1 and ErbB-4 and the heterodimer containing ErbB-2, the binding a/nity of EPR is much lower than those of other EGF-family ligands [1,11,31]. Structural di¡erences between EPR and other EGF-family ligands may be associated with the low binding a/nity of EPR for the receptors. The importance of the structure in the C-terminal domain of EGF-family ligands has been suggested in several studies [18^20]. The C-terminal domain includes Arg41 , Asp42 , and Leu47 of human EGF, and Arg42 of human TGF-K; these residues are responsible for optimal association with the ErbB-1 receptor [32^35]. Recently, the crystal structure of the extracellular domains of ErbB-1 bound to EGF has been reported. The region containing the loop (residues 6^9) and Arg41 of EGF interacts with site 2 in domain III of ErbB-1, and the C-terminal region around Arg45 of EGF interacts with site 3 in domain III of ErbB-1 [41]. The crystal structure of the complex of TGF-K and ErbB-1 extracellular domain has also been determined, showing that a number of residues in the C-terminal domain of TGF-K interact with the extracellular domain of ErbB-1 [42]. In addition, the HRG-K and HRG-L isoforms are identical in the EGF domain sequence up to ¢fth Cys, and both directly bind ErbB-3 and ErbB-4, although their binding a/nities are signi¢cantly di¡erent. The binding of HRG-K is 100-fold weaker than that of HRG-L for the ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 homodimers [11]. An insect cytokine, growth-blocking peptide (GBP) has an overall fold similar to the C-terminal domain of EGF, even though GBP lacks the N-terminal domain [37] (Fig. 3B). A previous study has shown that GBP directly binds and activates the EGF receptor in keratinocyte cells and enhances cell proliferation of human keratinocyte cells with a potency almost equivalent to that of human EGF [36]. Therefore, the C-terminal domain may play an important role in binding of EGF-like ligands to ErbB receptors, and so the di¡erence in the ligand^receptor binding a/nity may depend on structural di¡erences in the C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domains of EGF, TGF-K, BTCe, HRG-Ke, and HB-EGF have a short turn and a continuing doublestranded L-sheet, and GBP has a similar conformation with the C-terminal domain of EGF. On the other hand, EPR does not form a complete L-sheet structure in the C-terminal domain (Figs. 1^3). Fig. 4 shows the comparison of structures in the C-terminal domain among EGF-family ligands. In the C-terminal domain of EGF, hydrogen bonds are formed between the Ser38 and Thr44 [39] (Fig. 4A). These hydrogen

bonds also exist in the C-terminal domain of TGF-K, HRGKe and BTCe (Fig. 4B). However, the corresponding residues of EPR, Thr37 and His43 , do not form the hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4A). The incomplete L-sheet structure in the C-terminal domain of EPR results from the fact that only the amide proton of Thr37 exchanges slowly in the H^D exchange experiment and the lack of the interstrand NOEs between two segments (Tyr36 -Thr37 and His43 -Phe44 ) in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). The structures of EGF, TGF-K, HRG-Ke, BTCe and GBP previously reported were determined by NMR and these structures, except for TGF-K, were solved at acidic pH (pH 2.0^4.5) [13^16,37,40]. We analyzed the NOESY spectrum of EPR at pH 7.0 and con¢rmed that there was no interstrand NOEs in the C-terminal domain of EPR at pH 7.0. The far-UV CD spectra show that the conformation of EPR does not change in the pH range of 3.4^7.0 (Fig. 5). The far-UV CD mainly re£ects the secondary structure of proteins and is slightly contributed by aromatic side chains and disul¢de bonds. The similarity of the structures at pH 3.4 and 7.0 is also evident from the CSI data, which depend on the secondary structure of proteins [27]. Moreover, a previous NMR study has shown that the structures of EGF at pH 6.8 and 2.0 are nearly identical except for the region of Asp46 Arg53 [40]. Therefore, the lack of L-sheet structure in the C-terminal domain of EPR at pH 3.4 is not due to the low pH. The structural di¡erence in the C-terminal domain may provide an explanation for the reduced binding a/nity of EPR to the ErbB receptors.
