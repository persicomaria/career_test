Conserved phenylalanine 35 is one of the hydrophobic patch residues on the surface of cytochrome b5 (cyt b5). This patch is partially exposed on the surface of cyt b5 while its buried face is in direct van der Waals' contact with heme b. Residues Phe35 and Phe/Tyr74 also form an aromatic channel with His39, which is one of the axial ligands of heme b. By site-directed mutagenesis we have produced three mutants of cyt b5: Phe35fiTyr, Phe35fiLeu, and Phe35fiHis. We found that of these three mutants, the Phe35fiTyr mutant displays abnormal properties. The redox potential of the Phe35fiTyr mutant is 66 mV more negative than that of the wild-type cyt b5 and the oxidized Phe35fiTyr mutant is more stable towards thermal and chemical denaturation than wild-type cyt b5. In this study we studied the most interesting mutant, Phe35fiTyr, by X-ray crystallography, thermal denaturation, CD and kinetic studies of heme

dissociation to explore the origin of its unusual behaviors. Analysis of crystal structure of the Phe35fiTyr mutant shows that the overall structure of the mutant is basically the same as that of the wild-type protein. However, the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the heme pocket, and the increased van der Waals' and electrostatic interactions between the side chain of Tyr35 and the heme probably result in enhancement of stability of the Phe35fiTyr mutant. The kinetic difference of the heme trapped by the heme pocket also supports this conclusion. The detailed conformational changes of the proteins in response to heat have been studied by CD for the first time, revealing the existence of the folding intermediate. Keywords: cytochrome b5; folding; mutagenesis; stability; structure.

Cytochrome b5 (cyt b5) is a membrane-bound hemoprotein. It consists of a water-soluble, heme-containing domain and a short hydrophobic tail of approximate 40 amino acid residues that anchors the protein to the microsomal membrane [1]. The water-soluble domain functions as an electron mediator in the cytochrome P450 reductase system [2] and in the fatty acid desaturation system [3], etc. In erythrocytes, cyt b5 also exists as a soluble heme-binding protein lacking the hydrophobic tail where its physiological role is to reduce methemoglobin [4]. On the surface of cyt b5, there is a cluster of negatively charged residues surrounding the exposed heme edge. These

acidic residues have been proved to bind to the basic residues of the protein redox partners, such as cytochrome c [5,6], cytochrome P450 [7], metmyoglobin [8] and methemoglobin [9]. On the surface of cyt b5, there is also a ∞ hydrophobic patch of 350 A2 that is surrounded by negatively charged residues [10]. The patch consists of the hydrophobic residues, Phe35, Pro40, Leu70 and Phe/Tyr74 and is totally conserved among different species. This patch is partially exposed to the surface of cyt b5, while its buried part is in direct van der Waals' contact with the heme [11]. Residues Phe35 and Phe/Tyr74 also form an aromatic channel with His39, which is one of the axial ligands of heme b. In addition, it has been reported that Phe35 as well as Phe58 stabilizes the heme binding through aromatic interactions with the heme ring system [12]. To illustrate the possible roles of the negative patch as well as the aromatic channel, we previously designed and constructed three Phe35 mutants of cyt b5, Phe35fiTyr, Phe35fiLeu, and Phe35fiHis [13]. In that study we found that of the three mutants, the Phe35fiTyr mutant displayed abnormal properties. The redox potential of the Phe35fi Tyr mutant is 66 mV more negative than that of the wildtype cyt b5 [14], and the oxidized Phe35fiTyr mutant is obviously more stable towards heat and chemical denaturation than wild-type cyt b5 [13]. We also studied electron transfer reactions of cyt b5 Phe35fiTyr and Phe35fiLeu variants with cytochrome c, with the wild-type and the Tyr83Phe, Tyr83Leu variants of plastocyanin, and with the inorganic complexes [Fe(EDTA)]≠, [Fe(CDTA)]≠ and [Ru(NH3)6]3+. The change at Phe35 of cyt b5 did not affect the second-order rate constants of the electron transfer

reactions. These results show that the invariant aromatic residues and aromatic channel are not essential for electron transfer in these systems [15]. Because mutation at Phe35 causes changes in functional properties, and site-directed mutations rarely leads to increasing stability, it would be most interesting to reveal the essential difference between the wild-type and mutant proteins and to give a proper interpretation. In this paper, the secondary structural changes of cyt b5 and its Phe35fi Tyr mutant towards heat have been characterized by CD. Meanwhile, the heme dissociation and transfer reactions also provide a good means of examining the subtle local conformation changes around the heme group under natural conditions. Therefore, the heme dissociation kinetics at different urea concentrations and the heme transfer reactions between the wild-type cyt b5 or its Phe35fiTyr mutant and apo-myoglobin (Mb) were studied to demonstrate the affinity changes of the heme with cyt b5 polypeptide chain. In this paper the crystal structure of the cyt b5 Phe35fiTyr mutant has been determined by X-ray analysis. Based on the molecular structure and the above detailed studies the essence of these unusual behaviors is discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein preparation Bovine liver cyt b5 and its mutants were prepared and purified as described previously [13]. The concentrations of ferricytochrome b5 and the mutants were determined with the value of OD414 º 117 mM)1∆cm)1 [16]. Horse skeletal Mb was from Sigma and was purified according to the method described by Hagler et al. [17]. Apo-Mb was prepared according to the method of La Mar et al. [18]. The concentrations of Mb and apo-Mb were determined with the values of e409 º 171 mM)1∆cm)1 [19], and e280 º 15.2 mM)1∆cm)1 [20], respectively. X-ray analysis of cytochrome b5 Phe35fiTyr mutant Crystallization. Single crystals of the Phe35fiTyr mutant of trypsin-solubilized bovine liver microsomal cytochrome b5 (Tb5) were grown by the vapor diffusion method in hanging drops containing 10 mg∆mL)1 protein solution in 3.1≠3.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 20 ∞C. This is similar to the crystallizing condition used for wild-type Tb5 [21] and lipase-solubilized bovine liver microsomal cytochrome b5 (Lb5) [22]. The typical size of the single crystals was  0.6 ∑ 0.5 ∑ 0.3 mm. Crystals of wild-type Tb5 [21] and the Tb5 Val61fiHis mutant [23] are isomorphous belonging to the monoclinic space group C2 with the ∞ ∞ following unit cell parameters: a º 70.71 A, b º 40.39 A, ∞ c º 39.30 A and b º 111.72∞. The X-ray diffraction data of the Phe35fiTyr mutant ∞ were collected up to 1.8 A resolution using one single crystal on the MarResearch Imaging Plate-300 Detector System at room temperature. Data processing was accomplished with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK [24], giving an Rsym of 6.1% and data completeness of 94.3%. The crystal data and the data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure solution and crystallographic refinement. The structure determination and refinement of the cyt b5

Phe35fiTyr mutant were carried out using the program packages X-PLOR [25] and CNS [26] successively on a Silicon ∞ Graphics Indigo 2 workstation. All the data up to 1.8 A were used for structural refinement at the CNS refinement stage. A random sample of 10% of the X-ray data was excluded from the refinement and was taken as the test data set, and the agreement between the calculated and observed structure factors of the test data set was monitored throughout the course of the refinement. The graphics software TURBO-FRODO [27] was used for the model rebuilding. The initial structural model of the Phe35fiTyr mutant was determined using the difference Fourier method based on the crystal structure of the Val61His mutant of cyt b5 at ∞ 2.1 A resolution [23], from which all of the solvent molecules and the side chain of His61 were omitted. Rigid ∞ body refinement, limited to 2.2 A resolution, yielded an R factor of 27.1% and an Rfree of 28.4%. The positional refinement and temperature factor refinement were carried out for each round using the program X-PLOR. The program TURBO-FRODO was used to fit the side chains of Tyr35 and Val61, and then the model was adjusted manually to improve the fitting of the model by using the (2Fo-Fc) and the (Fo-Fc) electron density maps calculated regularly during the refinement. When the resolution was gradually ∞ extended to 2.0 A, the solvent molecules were fitted to the peaks higher than 3 r in the (Fo-Fc) electron density map if the sites satisfied reasonable distance and geometry criteria. Those water molecules without a reasonable hydrogen∞ bonding environment and with a thermal factor > 50 A2 were removed from the final model. The structure was further refined by using the more powerful program package CNS. The simulated annealing refinement starting from 2500 K with a cooling rate of 25 K per cycle was carried out, followed by the individual temperature factor refinement. Thermal denaturation of cyt b5 monitored by CD CD spectra of cyt b5 and its variants were recorded with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Naslab temperature controller. The path length was 0.1 cm in the 190≠250 nm region and 1 cm in the 250≠500 nm region,

respectively. The ellipticity was recorded at 100 nm∆min)1 speed, 0.2 nm resolution, five accumulations, 1.0 nm bandwidth. Cyt b5 or its mutant was dissolved in the phosphate buffer (100 mM pH 7.0). The protein concentrations were 25 lM in the 190≠250 nm region and 12.5 lM in the 250≠500 nm region, respectively. At each given temperature, the protein sample was allowed to equilibrate for 20 min before the spectrum was recorded. The temperature was increased stepwise over the range 30≠95 ∞C and the temperature accuracy was within ± 0.1 ∞C. Urea- and guanidine hydrochloride-mediated denaturation of cyt b5 variants For the kinetic study of urea-mediated denaturation of cyt b5 and its variants, the time course of the absorbance increase at 412 nm was recorded immediately after mixing of 0.3 mL cyt b5 and 2.7 mL urea or guanidine hydrochloride at 30 ∞C. The protein solution was prepared in a 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The final concentration of cyt b5 was 4 lM, and the concentration of urea and guanidine hydrochloride varied from 0 to 10 and from 0 to 6 M, respectively. All measurements were carried out on a HP 8452A diode-array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard). The kinetics of heme dissociation from cyt b5 by urea was analyzed as described in the literature [28,29]. Heme-transfer reaction between cyt b5 and apo-myoglobin: CD spectroscopy. The transfer of heme from cyt b5 to apoMb was examined in the 190≠250 nm and 250≠500 nm regions separately (10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, room temperature). Equal volumes of cyt b5 and apo-Mb were mixed at a final concentrations of 25 lM and 30 lM for cyt b5 and apo-Mb, respectively. The spectrum recording conditions were the same as described above. UV≠visible spectroscopy. Kinetic analysis of heme dissociation from the wild-type and the mutants of cyt b5 were performed as described by Hargrove et al. [30]. The heme transfer reaction was monitored with a HP 8452A diodearray spectrophotometer. The temperature was controlled at ± 0.1 ∞C with a Neslab RTE-5B circulating bath instrument. The reaction was initiated by rapidly mixing equal volumes of solutions containing cyt b5 and apo-Mb in a tandem mixing cell with path length of 2 ∑ 0.438 cm. The final concentrations were 6 lM for cyt b5 and 25 lM for apo-Mb in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5). The change in absorbance due to the heme transfer from cyt b5 to apo-Mb was monitored at 408 nm, which is the maximum difference between cyt b5 and metMb. The heme transfer reaction consists of two steps: the first step is the release of the heme from cyt b5, and the second step is the binding of apo-Mb with the heme b [30]. Because the second step is very fast (k º 5.8 ∑ 105∆M)1∆S)1) and the first step is the rate-determining step for the whole reaction [31], the heme transfer reaction from cyt b5 to apo-Mb could be treated as a first-order reaction. The kinetic trace can be described mathematically by the equation DAt º DAeq(1≠e≠kt) where DAt is the increase in absorbance at time t, DAeq is the increase in absorbance at equilibrium, and k is the rate constants for heme transfer.

The activation energy of the heme transfer reaction was obtained by measuring the rate constant over the temperature range of 20≠37 ∞C (10 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.5). The activation free energy was calculated from the equation [32,33] k º kBT/h exp(≠ DG∞,,/RT) where k is the experimental rate of heme dissociation, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, h is the Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and DG∞,, is the activation free energy.

RESULTS
Molecular structure of the cyt b5 Phe35fiTyr mutant The final structure of the Phe35fiTyr mutant refined at ∞ 1.8 A resolution gave an R factor of 19.2% and an Rfree of 23.8%. The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations are ∞ 0.010 A and 1.08∞ from the ideal bond lengths and bond angles, respectively. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. All of the nonglycine residues of the final model are located within the allowed regions (91.7% in the most favored regions) of the Ramachandran plot obtained by running the program PROCHECK [34]. The Luzzati plot shows that the estimated error of the refined coordinates is ∞  0.21 A. Fig. 1 shows the electron density of Tyr35 and the heme group in the Phe35fiTyr mutant. The overall structure of the Phe35fiTyr mutant is basically the same as that of the wild-type Tb5. The r.m.s. deviation for a total of 82 Ca ∞ atoms between the two molecules is 0.07 A. The secondary structures of the wild-type protein and its Phe35fiTyr mutant are the same. Fig. 2A and B shows a part of the heme-binding pocket of the Phe35fiTyr mutant in two different views. In wild-type cyt b5, the residue Phe35 is located at helix II, which is a part of the heme-binding pocket of cyt b5, and its side-chain points toward the heme. The mutation from the nonpolar residue Phe35 to the polar residue Tyr35 makes slight changes in the side chain conformation of this residue. The shift of the Ca atom of Tyr35 of the Phe35fiTyr mutant from that of Phe35 of the ∞ wild-type cyt b5 is 0.21 A, within the error limit. The side chain of Tyr35 of the Phe35fiTyr mutant also points toward the heme, but the phenol ring shifts away slightly from the heme plane to avoid the unreasonable contacts with the heme. The largest shift between the two superimposed

∞ aromatic rings is 0.45 A, i.e., the distance from the atom CZ (Fig. 1) of Tyr35 to that of Phe35. The crystal structure of the Phe35fiTyr mutant shows that the side chain of Tyr35 makes strong van der Waals' contacts with the heme, and ∞ the shortest distance is 3.21 A, i.e., from the phenol oxygen atom of Tyr35 to the carbon atom CHB (Fig. 1) of the heme. In addition, the hydroxyl group of Tyr35 forms a ∞ hydrogen bond (2.86 A) to a water molecule located outside the heme pocket, as shown in Fig. 2A. This water molecule ∞ forms another hydrogen bond (2.79 A) with the atom ND1

of the His26 side chain in a symmetry-related molecule (Fig. 2A). This water molecule was also found in the structure of wild-type cyt b5 as well as in other mutants. When Phe35 is mutated to Tyr35, this water molecule ∞ moves toward the hydroxyl group of Tyr35 by 0.43 A, and the side chain conformation of His26 correspondingly moves a little bit (for example, the atom ND1 of His26 ∞ moves by 0.15 A) to be closer to the water molecule, which is shown in Fig. 2B. These hydrogen-bonding interactions help to stabilize the orientation of Tyr35 side chain. The

Mutation at Phe35 of cytochrome b5 (Eur. J. Biochem. 269) 4291

conformation of the heme in the Phe35fiTyr mutant is basically the same as that in wild-type cyt b5. One of the two propionates is hydrogen bonded to the main- and side chain atoms of Ser64, while the other one extends into the solvent and does not form any hydrogen bond with the protein atoms. The former propionate displays the conserved conformation in the structures of the Phe35fiTyr mutant and of the wild-type protein as well as other mutants. However, the conformation of the latter is flexible. CD spectra of thermal denaturation of cyt b5 and its Phe35fiTyr mutant Fig. 3A shows the CD spectra of wild-type cyt b5 in the farUV region at 30 ∞C, 65 ∞C, 70 ∞C and 95 ∞C, respectively. The Phe35fiTyr mutant shows similar CD spectra (data not shown). When cyt b5 and its mutant were subjected to increasing temperature, the peak at 219 nm decreased monotonically. At 95 ∞C, the negative peak at 219 nm almost disappeared, but a large negative peak appeared at 203 nm. For wild-type cyt b5, the peak at 207 nm was still present at 95 ∞C, but for the mutant, the peak at 208 nm changed to a shoulder peak. All of these results suggest that the a-helix percentage of the protein and its mutant decreases sharply while the b-sheet percentage also reduces significantly at high temperature.

Fig. 3. CD spectra of the wild-type cyt b5 from 30 ∞C to 95 ∞C at (A) 195≠250 nm and (B) 250≠500 nm (for clarity of comparison, only part of the spectra are shown.)

Fig. 3B shows the CD spectra of wild-type cyt b5 in the 250≠500 nm region at 30 ∞C, 67 ∞C, 69.5 ∞C, 75 ∞C, 85 ∞C, and 95 ∞C, respectively. The CD spectra of the Phe35fiTyr mutant have a similar pattern and are not shown here. In the Soret region, the peak positions of the two proteins are basically similar at 30 ∞C, consistent with those reported in literatures [35,36]. At the near UV region, the negative CD peak at 268 nm derived from the four tyrosyl residues of wild-type cyt b5 [35] shows a different shape for the Phe35fiTyr mutant, which has five tyrosyl residues. The peak at 299.4 nm derived from the single tryptophan residue for the wild-type protein shifts to 297.6 nm for the mutant. The spectra in the 267≠299.4 nm region are only slightly different for these two proteins. Thermal denaturation of wild-type cyt b5 and its Phe35fiTyr mutant show similar CD behavior. A negative peak at 418 nm with strong intensity and a positive peak at 390 nm at room temperature are characteristic of low-spin state of ferric cyt b5 [36]. When the temperature was increased the negative peak at 418 nm was blue-shifted with a gradual reduction of its intensity. Simultaneously, the intensity of the positive peak at 390 nm decreased. We found that with increasing temperature to 69.5 ∞C, a new peak around 398 nm with a negative intensity appeared. The intensity of the peak at 398 nm increased dramatically from 69.5 to 75 ∞C, and then gradually decreased from 75 ∞C to higher temperature. However, even at 95 ∞C, this peak does not disappear. Unexpectedly our results are very different from those of the rabbit liver cyt b5 reported by Sugiyama et al. [36]. Their work showed that there was almost no absorption in the 300≠500 nm region of the CD spectrum when the temperature was 83 ∞C. This is the first detailed CD spectrum study on the secondary structure of cyt b5, and characterization of the intermediate conformation. The negative peak at 267 nm, which is attributed to absorption from tyrosyl residues Tyr6, Tyr7, Tyr27 and Tyr30 [35,37], gradually decreased with increasing temperature. At 69.5 ∞C, the peak intensity reduced to almost zero. A positive peak at this region appeared and its intensity gradually increased when the temperature changed from 69.5 ∞C to 75 ∞C, then gradually decreased at higher temperature. The negative peak at 299.4 nm, which is assigned to the contribution of Trp22, decreased monotonically with the increase in temperature. It is known from X-ray structural analysis of wild-type cyt b5 [21] that the core 2 consists of b-strand III (Tyr27≠Leu32), b-strand II (Thr21≠Leu25), b-strand I (Lys5≠Tyr7) and a-helix I (Thr8≠ His15). Trp22, Tyr6, Tyr7, Tyr27 and Tyr30 are the main aromatic components of the core 2 of cyt b5. The pattern of the absorption changes around 267 nm and 299.4 nm implies that even though core 2 is largely intact after the removal of the heme from the protein as reported by Falzone et al. [38] core 2 experiences significant structural fluctuation and gradually undergoes complete unfolding. This study clearly shows the whole process of unfolding and is an important supplement to the results reported by Pfeil [39] by means of second derivative spectra and heat capacity of apo- and holo-cyt b5. Fig. 4A demonstrates the transitional CD curves of wild-type cyt b5 monitored at 222 nm, 299 nm, 398.4 nm and 418.8 nm. The curves of 222 nm, 299 nm and 418.8 nm possess a similar pattern suggesting that dissociation of the

constant increased sharply after the urea concentration exceeded 5 M. These results reflect the tightness of the heme attaching to the polypeptide of cyt b5. For the Phe35fiTyr mutant the heme pocket traps the heme even more strongly than the wild-type protein. Obviously, for the Phe35fiLeu mutant the interactions between the heme and its pocket are much weaker, only a moderate concentration of urea is needed to speed up the release of heme from the pocket. The heme transfer from cyt b5 or its Phe35fiTyr mutant to apo-Mb

Fe≠His bond is accompanied by the a-helix unfolding of the peptide chain and the destroying of Trp22 asymmetrical environment. Fig. 4B shows the transitional curves of the Phe35fiTyr mutant, which exhibits a pattern similar to that of the wild-type protein. All of the CD spectra transitions of the Phe35fiTyr mutant at 222 nm, 299 nm, 398.4 nm, and 418.8 nm in response to heat are  3 ∞C higher than those of the wild-type cyt b5, which is consistent with the result of UV≠visible measurement [13]. The results of denaturation of these proteins by guanidine hydrochloride are also in agreement with those of urea denaturation. These results demonstrate that the Phe35fiTyr mutant increases not only the affinity of the heme to the polypeptide chain but also the stability of the secondary structure. The kinetics of the heme dissociation from cyt b5 variants mediated by urea Urea-mediated denaturation of cyt b5 variants was treated as a first-order reaction, producing the rate constants of the heme dissociation at different urea concentrations. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The rate constants of heme dissociation reaction increased slightly with the increase in urea concentration for the wild-type protein. However, it is interesting to note that cyt b5 Phe35fiTyr shows a lower rate. On the contrary, for the Phe35fiLeu mutant the rate

The kinetic parameters of heme dissociation from cyt b5 were determined under nondenaturation conditions by measuring the spontaneous release of the heme from cyt b5 to apo-Mb, which is used as a heme trap. Although the CD spectra could show the reaction process clearly, the protein concentration required is much higher than for the UV≠visible method. Because the high concentration of protein could cause denaturation of the apo-protein during the long assay time, all of the heme transfer reactions were monitored only by the UV≠visible spectra. The rates of heme transfer reaction from the wild-type or the Phe35fi Tyr mutant of cyt b5 to apo-Mb at 25 ± 0.1 ∞C show obviously differences, which can be seen in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Compared with wild-type cyt b5, the heme affinity of the Phe35fiTyr mutant increased greatly. The activation free energy and activation energy listed in Table 3, which were calculated from Eyring plots (Fig. 7) and Arrhenius plots (data not shown), also show that the mutation has affected the conformation of the transition state. The CD spectra of Mb, apo-Mb, wild-type cyt b5 and apo-cyt b5 demonstrate that these proteins have an identical structure as reported previously [35,36,40,41]. The apocyt b5 and apo-Mb have no absorption in the Soret band region because of the lack of the heme prosthetic group. For the holo-cyt b5 and holo-Mb, the CD spectra of the Soret band are entirely different, which illustrates the difference in the heme environment between cyt b5 and Mb. In the CD spectra of cyt b5, there is a negative peak at 418 nm with strong intensity [36]. In contrast, Mb has a strong positive absorption at 408 nm [41]. Hence, the heme transfer reaction from cyt b5 to apo-Mb could be easily and precisely

monitored by CD which clearly demonstrates that the heme transfer reaction under the conditions used proceeded to completion (data not shown). Meanwhile, from the concentration changes of the holo-Mb in the reaction monitored by UV≠visible spectroscopy, the same conclusion ) that this reaction is entirely completed ) can be drawn.

DISCUSSION
Protein folding studied by CD spectra Up to now, CD spectra of cyt b5 have been studied by only a few groups [35,36,39]. These CD studies suggested that there is an increase in disorder and less secondary structure in the apo-form [35]. However, no detailed information was

provided about the protein's folding and stability. There is evidence for the folding of apo-cyt b5 in vivo prior to the formation of holo-cyt b5 [42]. Meanwhile, it is reported that cyt b5 consists of two hydrophobic cores. Core 1 is normally retained by the prosthetic heme group; core 2 comprises mainly b-sheets. These two cores are well maintained in the apo-form of the protein [43] and so are especially interesting for the study of the folding mechanism, intermediates and stability of the protein by CD spectra. Usually, the stability of cyt b5 could be investigated through the heme dissociation reaction by exposing the protein to the denaturant or heat. This process was considered to be a two-state mechanism (H – A), in which only the holo-cyt b5 (H) and the apo-cyt b5 (A) are present at significant concentrations [28,44]. It was thought that the heme-binding domain of cyt b5 was denatured simultaneously with heme dissociation. The UV≠visible spectrum study of cyt b5 in response to heat and urea did display several isosbestic points in the absorbance curves, and the denaturation curves really showed that the denaturation followed the two-state mechanism. The denaturation curves of CD absorption at 222 nm, 299 nm and 418.8 nm shown in Fig. 4A and B indicate that unfolding of the a-helices, b-sheets and breaking of the His≠ Fe bonds of the heme follow the two-state mechanism. It is noted that a new absorption peak that appeared at 398.4 nm displays slightly different denaturation behaviours. Definitely, the absorption at 398.4 nm is derived from a heme derivative. As heme is a symmetrical chromophore, it exhibits no inherent optical activity itself [45,46]. Our experiment also shows that heme in the buffer solution itself does not exhibit any CD absorption in the region of 250≠ 500 nm at 30≠95 ∞C. Apo-cyt b5 has no CD absorption in the Soret band too, but shows the absorption contributed from aromatic amino acids in the near UV region [35]. The concurrent existence of the Soret band absorption at 418.8 nm and 398.4 nm at 69.5 ∞C shown in Fig. 3B indicates that probably there are two types of heme derivative in the solution; at this stage the heme was not totally released from the protein heme pocket into the aqueous environment and part of the low-spin and six-coordinated heme was changed into the high-spin state

with breaking of the His≠Fe bonds. It is known that the apo-cyt b5 prepared under mild conditions could generally maintain the holo-like structures except for some conformational fluctuations observed in the local regions [47]. However, as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations all a-helices in core 1 are highly mobile, and the tertiary structure in core 2 of cyt b5 is rather rigid [48]. Thus, the denaturation curve of the wild-type protein monitored at 398.4 nm and 67≠75 ∞C by CD implied that there was probably a collapse of core 1 accompanied by partially unfolding of the a-helices and breaking of Fe≠His bonds. This temperature region is coincident with the transition region of cyt b5 denaturation in response to heat monitored by UV≠visible spectra at 418 nm. At this time, the heme was still wrapped up in the polypeptide chain of cyt b5. Therefore, the CD absorption at 398.4 nm could be the result of another form of heme, an intermediate state, in which the heme is not coordinated by two histidine residues and does not sit normally in the heme pocket. More probably it is enveloped by the partially unfolded cyt b5 polypeptide chain after the collapse of hydrophobic core 1. From the observations of CD absorption of tryptophan and tyrosines, however, it is believed at that time the core 2 of cyt b5 remains intact. Even at 95 ∞C, this peak at 398.4 nm does not disappear completely. Possibly, the heme is still partially attached to some parts of the random coil of denatured cyt b5 polypeptide chain through hydrophobic interactions. Actually, after we reached this conclusion, we found that Gray's group had published a short communication indicating that in the folding study of cyt b562, normally ‘the heme iron is ligated axially by the side chains of Met7 and His102. It is likely that one of these ligands remains attached to the heme in the unfolded state’ [49,50]. Here, we provide the detailed CD spectra evidencing the existence of the intermediate and a reasonable explanation. The reason why our results do not agree with those obtained for the rabbit liver cyt b5 [36] is not yet known. But, it is noted that the bovine liver Tb5 used in this work is more stable than rabbit liver cyt b5. The Tm (transition midpoint of the heat denaturation curve of the UV≠visible spectrum at 412 nm) is 66.9 ∞C for bovine liver Tb5 and 55.0 ∞C for rabbit liver cyt b5 [13,36]. Maybe a detailed structural study, similar to the comparison between the microsomal cyt b5 and the outer membrane liver mitochondria cyt b5 [51], is required to reveal the essence of the different properties. The stability of cyt b5 Phe35 mutants The wild-type protein usually develops an optimal architecture to fulfill its biological functions after hundreds and thousands years of evolution and natural selection. Artificial site-directed mutagenesis of proteins most often leads to a decrease in stability: an increase in stability in the mutant proteins is comparatively rare [52,53]. The main components of protein stability that could be perturbed by mutation at interior groups include hydrophobic effects, van der Waals' forces, backbone conformation, hydrogen bonds, local polarity and side chain volume of the substituted residue. Substitution of tyrosine for phenylalanine should generate 4.8 kJ∆mol)1 destabilization energy because of the decreased hydrophobic nature of tyrosine, and may contribute 4≠6 kJ∆mol)1 to protein stability if

there is another hydrogen bond generated in the cyt b5 Phe35fiTyr mutant [53,54]. In our previous study [13], the Phe35fiTyr mutant of cyt b5 in the oxidized state is 3.3 kJ∆mol)1 more stable than the wild-type protein towards heat denaturation and is 4.3 kJ∆mol)1 more stable in urea denaturation. The CD spectra of heat denaturation also show that the structure transition temperature for the Phe35fiTyr mutant is higher than that for the wild-type. Kinetically, the rate constant of heme transfer reactions from cyt b5 to apo-Mb for the wild-type protein is 10 times faster than that for the Phe35fiTyr mutant. The ureamediated heme dissociation reactions of various cyt b5 variants also demonstrate that the heme is trapped in the heme pocket with different degrees of tightness. Recently, Silchenko et al. [55] found that cyt b5 from the outer mitochondrial membrane of rat liver is substantially more stable against thermal and chemical denaturation than bovine liver cyt b5. Their study demonstrated that the enhanced stability of outer mitochondrial membrane cyt b5 is in large part due to slow heme release, where the heme is kinetically trapped in the heme pocket of hemoproteins. As shown in previous work, the residues on the protein surface were considered to be less important and to have minor effect on protein stability because these residues exert little effect on the interactions between the heme and the heme pocket [6,56]. For the heme pocket residues such as Phe35, Val61, Val45 and Phe58 the situation is entirely different. The mutation from the hydrophobic residue Phe35 to a larger polar residue Tyr35 does not make significant changes in the overall structure and the local structure around the mutation site because there is enough space to accommodate an additional hydroxyl group. However, the crystal structure of the Phe35fiTyr mutant shows that the ∞ hydroxyl oxygen atom of the side chain of Tyr35 is 3.21 A away from the atom CHB of the pyrrole group of the heme, making strong van der Waals' contacts with the heme. Obviously, the introduction of hydroxyl group in the heme pocket strengthens the interactions between Tyr35 and the heme with the iron in the oxidative state. The increased van der Waals' interactions between the side chain of Tyr35 and the heme can probably make an obstacle to the departure of the heme from the hydrophobic pocket of the protein. The total consequence of this mutation made ferricytochrome b5 Phe35fiTyr more stable compared with the wild-type protein. In the case of the cyt b5 Phe35fiHis mutant, besides the increased hydrophilicity of the histidine residue, the side chain ∞ volume decreases by 36 A3 compared to the wild-type cyt b5 which would effectively reduce the van der Waals' contact between the histidine and the heme. So, the Phe35fiHis mutant is 11.8 kJ∆mol)1 less stable than the wild-type protein [13]. There is a stabilization effect of the heme ring binding to Phe35 and Phe58 by hydrophobic aromatic interactions. It has been reported that an edge-to-face orientation between two aromatic groups is energetically favorable [57]. Sakamoto et al. [45] have studied the effect of amino acids substitution of hydrophobic residues on heme-binding properties in the designed two-a-helix peptides. Their studies demonstrated that the edge-to-face interactions between the aromatic side chain of the phenylalanine residues and the porphyrin plane might contribute to the conformation of peptide≠heme conjugates. They also

proved that the phenylalanine residue located at i ± 4 relative to the axial ligand histidine residue in the a-helix was critical to the edge-to-face interaction between the phenylalanine side chain and the porphyrin ring, providing stabilization of peptide≠heme conjugates [45,46,58]. The Phe35≠His39 of cyt b5 is consistent with i ± 4 arrangement. It is clear that the substitution of tyrosine for phenylalanine at position 35 does not destroy the aromatic interactions and can also maintain the edge-to-face interaction, providing the stabilization effect of the heme binding. In the case of the Phe35fiLeu mutant, however, substitution of leucine for phenylalanine should break this effect. This is also supported by the denaturation experiment [13], which showed that the Phe35fiLeu mutant is 7.8 kJ∆mol)1 less stable towards heat and 7.9 kJ∆mol)1 less stable towards urea than the wild-type protein. Factors affecting redox potential of the Phe35 mutants The redox potential of the Phe35fiTyr mutant shifts negatively by 66 mV compared to that of the wild-type cyt b5 [13]. As we know, a hydrophilic environment stabilizes the oxidized state, leading to a lower redox potential [53]. In particular, the introduction of a polar hydroxyl group in the ‘low dielectric’ interior of the protein can play a much stronger electrostatic role, stabilizing ferric iron. The reduction of hydrophobicity reasonably accounts for the negative shift of redox potential. In addition, the hydrogen bonding formation between the tyrosine and the conserved water molecule shown in the crystal structure of the Phe35fiTyr mutant enhances significantly hydrophilic influence on the heme causing great alteration of the protein properties [59].
