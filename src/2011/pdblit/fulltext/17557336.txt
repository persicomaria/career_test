ABSTRACT Golgi a-mannosidase II (GMII), a zinc-dependent glycosyl hydrolase, is a promising target for drug development in anti-tumor therapies. Using X-ray crystallography, we have determined the structure of Drosophila melanogaster GMII (dGMII) complexed with three different inhibitors exhibiting IC50's ranging from 80 to 1000 lM. These structures, along with those of seven other available dGMII/inhibitor complexes, were then used as a basis for the evaluation of seven docking programs (GOLD, Glide, FlexX, AutoDock, eHiTS, LigandFit, and FITTED). We found that small inhibitors could be accurately docked by most of the software, while docking of larger compounds (i.e., those with extended aromatic cycles or long aliphatic chains) was more problematic. Overall, Glide provided the best docking results, with the most accurately predicted binding around the active site zinc atom. Further evaluation of Glide's performance revealed its ability to extract active compounds from a benchmark library of decoys.

INTRODUCTION Glycoproteins and glycolipids are major components of the outer surface of mammalian cells and the majority of cell surface and secreted proteins of eukaryotes are glycosylated. The carbohydrates are commonly bound to an asparagine residue within the sequence Asn-X-Ser (or Thr) through an N-glycosidic linkage.1 The glycosylation process corresponds to a post-translational modification involving a large panel of specific glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, and is responsible for proper processing of proteins. The biosynthesis of Asn-linked glycoproteins2­4 starts in the endoplasmic reticulum then progresses in the Golgi apparatus to produce the mature glycosylated structure on the nascent protein.5,6 This second step is highly dependent on species, tissues and cells, thus resulting in the diverse nature of the final branched oligosaccharides. The Golgi a-mannosidase II (GMII) is responsible for the specific trimming of two mannose residues from the branched GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 mannose intermediate, with retention of sugar anomeric configuration, and is therefore a key enzyme of the Golgi processing pathway. In various tumor cells, the distribution of cell surface N-linked oligosaccharides is altered and correlates with disease progression, metastasis and poor prognosis.7­10 GMII has consequently been viewed as a potential target in the development of new anti-cancer therapies. In clinical trials, swainsonine, a natural inhibitor of GMII featuring a 4-amino-4-deoxy-mannofuranoside unit11,12 has been shown to reduce certain tumors and hematological dysfunctions.13,14 However, the co-inhibition of lysosomal mannosidases prevents further development of this compound towards medicinal treatments. It is thus highly important to find highly specific inhibitors of GMII that would exhibit anti-cancer activity. In an ideal scenario, medicinal chemists use three-dimensional structures of the various protein targets to design potent and selective inhibitors. In fact, docking studies performed on various mannosidases would aid in the computational evaluation of the selectivity of the inhibitors. Unfortunately, mammalian mannosidases

Docking -Mannosidase II Inhibitors

are difficult to purify in suitable quantities and to date only a single structure of bovine lysosomal mannosidase ° is available with a suboptimal resolution of 2.70 A, which hinders the possibility of performing accurate docking experiments on it. Jack bean a-mannosidase was first found to be a readily available and reliable model enzyme for assaying inhibition of mammalian GMII, however its crystal structure and primary sequence has not yet been determined.15 More recently, Drosophila melanogaster GMII (dGMII), which displays high sequence identity with human GMII (hGMII), 40% identity and 70% homology, was used as a valid model of the structural and functional features of the mammalian enzyme.16­18 In particular, it has been shown that the exposed residues in the active site cavity are almost completely conserved between hGMII and dGMII.17 As a consequence, the latter was used in place of hGMII in various crystallographic studies and has recently provided a series of crystal structures of GMII:inhibitor complexes.19 This newly available structural data could now be the starting point for the structure-based design of potentially active and selective GMII inhibitors. For this purpose, we naturally turned our attention to the available computational structure-based drug design methods. For the last two decades, computational methods for structure-based drug design have evolved significantly. Their increasing accuracy has been followed with growing interest by the pharmaceutical industry. Among these methods, docking techniques have been extensively investigated and exploited in medicinal chemistry projects. Unfortunately, no universal method (i.e., applicable to any protein target) has been discovered and the choice of the software has to be done wisely.20 While the accuracy of existing methods is increasing, remaining limitations have been identified. The flexibility of the enzyme and the presence of key water molecules are major issues yet to be addressed.21,22 To account for the induced-fit of the protein upon binding of a ligand, several strategies have been proposed.23 We report herein our efforts in the structural determination of dGMII:inhibitor complexes and their use in docking studies. In particular, three new structures of dGMII:inhibitor complexes are presented. The present work had two main goals, the additional validation of our recently developed software FITTED and the identification of accurate software for designing and screening potential GMII inhibitors. Thus, a large section of this report will be devoted to a comparative study of the most accurate docking programs, namely Glide,24 GOLD,25 FlexX,26 LigandFit,27 eHiTS,28 AutoDock29 and FITTED30 in combination with a large panel of scoring functions. This study was not intended to fully evaluate these docking programs but to find the best one in the context of mannosidase inhibition. A last section will describe the assessment of the accuracy of Glide in a virtual screening study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Enzyme assays and crystallography

Measurement of inhibition, crystallization, data collection, and structural refinement were carried out essentially as outlined by Kuntz et al.31 with the exceptions noted below. Crystals of dGMII were grown overnight, washed with phosphate buffered reservoir solution (as per Shah et al.32) and soaked with 10 mM 8 and 9 for at least 3 h. In the case of 10, crystals were soaked in Trisbuffered reservoir solution without phosphate washing. Data were collected on Beamline 191D at the Advanced Photon Source for crystals of 8 and 9 and at Beamline A1 at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source for 10. 400 frames with 0.58 oscillation/frame were collected. To obtain a data set with good completeness, data on two crystals of 9 were collected and the data merged with Scalepack.
Preparation of structures for docking

The structures of the dGMII complexes were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes: 1HWW, 1HXK, 1PS3, 1R33, 1R34, 1TQS, 1TQT, as well as the newly determined 2F18, 2F1A, 2F1B presented here) and pre¨ pared using Maestro 7.033 from Schrodinger as follows. Water molecules were removed and the resulting proteins were aligned based on the a-carbon trace. Hydrogen atoms were added to both proteins and ligands, and bonds to the zinc atom were broken. The atom types and partial charges were first assigned automatically. Charges of the catalytic site residues were corrected following a DFT calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory (Jaguar 6.034) on a truncated site consisting of His90, His471, Asp92, Asp204 and Zn; Mulliken populations were considered as the source of the charges. These charges were assigned at different stages depending on the docking software used. Appropriate zinc atom van der Waals parameters were obtained from the literature35 and implemented in each program requiring these parameters. The structures of the ligands were optimized through energy minimization (Tripos force field) prior to the docking (MLS, minimized ligand structures); the original crystal structure (CLS, crystal-derived ligand structures) conformations were kept for RMSD measurements.
Glide

° Neutral zones (as defined in Glide) of 10­20 A around the ligands were first defined and the inhibitor/proteins were refined using the local optimization procedure proposed in Glide. The zinc parameters were added to the OPLS2003 force field definition and specific charges were assigned to the catalytic residues and zinc atom. The rest of the protein and the ligands were assigned Macromodel/

OPLS2003 charges and atom types. Grids were prepared for each protein with the exact same center and a size of ° 40 A. A constraint that forced the interaction with the metal ion was included. A specific keyword (CMAE) was employed for the DFT-derived partial charges (see above) to be maintained during the grid preparation. Preparation, refinement and grid calculation took about 4 h per protein on an SGI R16K. The ligands were minimized using the OPLS2003 forcefield and submitted to Glide for docking. To ensure convergence, an exhaustive search was secured by using search parameters set to their maximum values and a set of 25 runs. This exhaustive search led to the docking of the 10 inhibitors on a single receptor in an average time of 44 min on an SGI R16K. The following parameters were used: ligvdwscale factor 1.0; maxkeep 50,000; maxconf 10,000; nreport 5000; maxref 4000; scorecut 100. A specific keyword (reference) was needed to report the RMSD.
Glide VS

identical size and center as for the Glide study were computed. Gasteiger-Marsili charges were assigned to the inhibitors whenever possible.37 Otherwise, when nonparameterized groups (e.g., sulfur cation) were present, partial charges were computed using the MOPAC semi-empirical method (Mulliken charges). Both the CLS and MLS were used as input. Twenty-five runs with a maximum of 1,000,000 energy evaluations and a population size of 100 individuals were performed. The same calculations were also done with a maximum of 5,000,000 energy evaluations and a population of 200 individuals but did not show any improvement. This last set of computations indicates a good convergence using a maximum of 1,000,000 energy evaluations and a population size of 100 individuals. The default parameters for the Solis and Wets optimization and the genetic operators were used.
eHiTS

Default parameters were used to dock with Glide; the time-consuming exhaustive search described above was discarded in order to better simulate a realistic virtual screening study. The protein target 1PS3 was used as prepared for the Glide docking described above. Ligands 11­17 were prepared for docking as described in Preparation of structures for docking.
FlexX

No interface is provided with eHiTS. The protein input structures were given as pdb files and the ligands as mol2 files. The receptor was truncated keeping any ° residue with at least one atom within 7.0 A from any of the inhibitors. The CLS and MLS were alternatively used. The docking was performed using the default parameters for the docking (fragment docking, graph matching algorithm, and pose optimization) and scoring. The highest accuracy was selected.
GOLD

The input structures were prepared using the Sybyl 7.0 interface.36 Binding sites based on proteins truncated at ° 7.0 A around the inhibitors were used; ligand MLS structures were used as recommended in the FlexX User Manual. The RIGID_RING mode was selected in order to keep the input conformation as the sole ring conformation (as for Glide and AutoDock). The torsion-standard. dat library of torsions was used. All the other default parameters for the various incremental construction stages or for the input file setup were used. An additional metal pharmacophore-filter using the FlexX-Pharm module was used. All the successful poses were kept for further analysis. Rescoring with the scoring functions implemented in CScore of both the nonrelaxed (FlexX output) and relaxed (Tripos force field) docked poses was performed on a receptor featuring the free coordination sites of the Zn atom as dummy atoms (Tripos atom type ``Du'').
AutoDock

The protein and ligand (MLS) mol2 files prepared previously were used for this study. Most of the optimized parameters were set as defaults (population size of 100 individuals, five islands, niche size of two, and a selection pressure of 1.1). However, in order to ensure an exhaustive search for each ligand, the following parameters were used: 200,000 as maximum operations allowed and a ° binding site defined using a radius of 18 A. A substruc° ture constraint (alcohol functional group within 2.5 A from the zinc atom with a spring constant of 5.0 kcal/ ° A2) was also used in a set of runs. The docking termi° nated when the top three solutions were within 1.0 A, otherwise 25 runs were carried out. ChemScore and GoldScore scoring functions were used alternatively. Although the metal coordination can be automatically determined, we overruled the automatic definition and set two possible metal coordination geometries (trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral).
LigandFit

The AutoDock Tool interface was used to prepare the ligands and the proteins. Kollman charges and solvation parameters were assigned to the protein. The created pdbqs proteins files were modified to account for the presence of a metal (called M) and the calculated charges for the catalytic site residues and the zinc ion. Grids of

The protein and ligand (MLS) structures prepared previously were loaded on Cerius2.38 Self-docking with the zinc atom defined as a ``feature'' was first attempted with the three scoring functions (PLP, CFF, Dreiding); crossDOI 10.1002/prot

docking was carried out only with PLP. Default parameters were used.
FITTED 1.0

The protein and ligands were processed using ProCESS and SMART, two modules in FITTED.30 Population sizes of 100 individuals were used and a maximum of 100 generations were carried out. All other default parameters were used as defined elsewhere.30 To avoid a strong bias ° of the docking, a sphere as large as 6.0 A centered on the zinc atom was used to orient the metal-binding moieties in the docking. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Docking data set

Seven structures of dGMII:inhibitor complexes were selected from available crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)39 and added to the three described below. Structures with ligands that are not competitive ° inhibitors or structures with resolution worse than 2.0 A were discarded. Ligands 1­7 (Table I) were selected to represent a wide range of activity against dGMII. The seven dGMII:inhibitor complexes were imported from the Protein Data Bank: 1HWW (swainsonine),17 1HXK (1-deoxymannojirimycin),17 1PS3 (kifunensine),32 1R33,40 1R34,40 1TQS (salacinol),31 and 1TQT.31 We also included in this study three polyfunctionalized pyrrolidine derivatives (8­10) related to the family of a-mannosidase inhibitors developed by Vogel and co-workers41­43 which were co-crystallized in the active site of dGMII (2F18, 2F1A, 2F1B). The latter inhibitors could be described as consisting of a pyrrolidine head coupled to a phenylglycinol tail.
Crystallography

We report here the information retrieved from the analysis of the crystal structures of dGMII complexed with inhibitors 8, 9, and 10. Resolution of the synchro° tron collected data was 1.30­1.45 A and Rfree was 18­ 19% for the three structures. Detailed data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table II. Figure 1 shows the quality of the electron density around the bound inhibitors. The density for inhibitors 8 and 10 was much cleaner in the ``tail'' region of the aromatic ring than the similar region of inhibitor 9. For 9, the electron density of the aromatic ring was only visible when the contour levels of the maps were lowered significantly. The average temperature factors for the aromatic groups of 8 and 10 were 16 and 17.6, respectively, while for 9, it was 32.5. This indicated that this region of 9 was in an unfavorable location, and might be oscillating between numbers of positions so that it did not show up clearly in the electron density map. This lack of good

density correlated well with the poorer inhibitory activity for 9 (IC50 ¼ 720 lM vs. IC50 ¼ 80 lM for 8). The configuration of the phenylglycinol residue was thus a determinant of the recognition process. The binding of the highly active inhibitor 8 in the active site of dGMII is illustrated in Figure 2 and a list of interactions between the three inhibitors and the protein ° where the interaction distance was less than 3.2 A is given in Table III. For comparison, the interaction distances with swainsonine 1 (IC50 ¼ 17 nM) are also indicated. These distances were derived from a high resolu° tion (1.30 A) dGMII:1 co-crystal structure.17 The major changes between the three pyrrolidine-based inhibitors occurred in the interaction with the terminal hydroxyl group (OH-9). The importance of the two hydroxyl groups on the pyrrolidine ring was clear. There were tight interactions between the hydroxyl moieties and the active site zinc as well as interactions with His90, Asp92, Asp204, His471, and Asp472. An unusual feature of the inhibitors presented in this article was that there was no hydroxyl group occupying the space between Asp472 OD1 and Tyr727 OH (Figure 2). In all the structures that we have previously examined there has been a hydroxyl group on the bound compound sitting between Asp472 OD1 and Tyr727 OH. In the case of phosphate-washed crystals where no compound was bound in the active site, the position was occupied by a water molecule. (Kuntz DA, unpublished results) As a result of this absence of hydroxyl group, the Tyr727 OH was shifted ° about 0.6 A towards the Asp472 OD1. Other interactions with the inhibitors were also seen, in particular with N7 in the ``tail'' region. Trp95 made two important interactions with the inhibitors. There was a T-shaped interaction between the aromatic ring in the inhibitor and the indole in the tryptophan side-chain, the two planes being at near right angles of each other. Trp95 also made stacking hydrophobic interactions with the pyrrolidine ring, a common feature of GMII complexes.17 In the dGMII:8 complex, the terminal oxygen (O9) ° made numerous hydrogen bonds. It was 2.7 A from ° from a water molecule, 3.3 A from ° Asp340 OD1, 2.8 A ° from Asp341 OD1. An almost Tyr269 OH, and 3.5 A identical bonding pattern was seen for inhibitor 10, although the interaction distances were slightly longer. ° ° The oxygen (O9) was 2.7 A from Asp340 OD1, 2.8 A ° from Tyr269 OH, and 3.7 from a water molecule, 3.5 A ° A from Asp341 OD1. Because of the different stereochemistry of the inhibitor 9, the O9 oxygen sat in a dif° ferent location and was now 4.8 A from Asp340 OD1 ° from Asp341 OD1. Nevertheless, there were and 4.5 A still interactions with Tyr269 and two water molecules (Table III). Inhibitors 8 and 10 exhibited virtually identical binding modes in the active site of dGMII (Fig. 3), despite the additional methyl group on the pyrrolidine ring in 10 (labeled C21 in the PDB file). In the protein, however,

the active site region was opened up in the structure of 10 compared to the structure of 8, Phe206 and Tyr727 being pushed away from the inhibitor. The distance between C2 in the inhibitors and CZ of Phe206 was 4.8 ° ° A in the 10:dGMII complex, while it was 4.3 A in the ° 8:dGMII adduct. The Tyr727 OH was shifted 0.4 A away from C21. The additional methyl group in 10 was in a position normally occupied by a polar hydroxyl in other inhibitors; the conformational stress put on the enzyme to accommodate its binding might be a reason for the poorer affinity of 10 relative to 8 (IC50 ¼ 1000 lM vs. IC50 ¼ 80 lM). The position of the aromatic group was similar to that occupied by the ends of the chain of the salacinol analog complexes.31 An overlay of the crystal structure binding mode of the diastereomer of salacinol (7) with 8 is shown in Figure 4(b). Both of these inhibitors exhibited very clear density in their ``tail'' regions. This suggested that these parts of the inhibitors were occupying a favorable area of the active site space. Nevertheless, a major difference was that the zinc ion was bound to two hydroxyl groups of the inhibitor 8, but only to one hydroxyl group of the diastereoisomer of salacinol (7). This might account for the poor inhibitory properties of 7 in comparison with 8 (IC50 ¼ 7.5 mM vs. IC50 ¼ 80 lM). The binding modes of 8 and swainsonine (1) are compared in Figure 4(b). It was obvious that although the
DOI 10.1002/prot

interatomic distances were almost identical (Table III), there was a slight shift in the binding position of 8. This shift along with the presence of the long and flexible aromatic tail (leading to entropy loss upon binding), the additional ammonium group (high desolvation cost upon binding) as well as the lack of a third hydroxyl interacting with the protein, might account for its weaker inhibitory potency (IC50 ¼ 80 lM for 8 vs. IC50 ¼ 17 nM for 1).
Docking of GMII inhibitors--general considerations

A close look at the crystal structures revealed challenges for the accurate docking of GMII inhibitors. First, a zinc atom was involved in the catalytic activity of this enzyme and in the strong binding of the selected inhibitors. Second, a few of the active inhibitors featured solvent-exposed moieties that were not specifically interacting with any of the enzyme residues as exemplified by the electron density of compound 9 in Figure 1. Third, there were bound water molecules that made important interactions with the inhibitors (in the case of 8, at the amino group in the pyrrolidine ring and the O9 oxygen in the tail region). It was therefore expected that docking accuracy would be linked to a proper handling of the zinc ligation and solvation/desolvation by both the conformational sampling engine and the scoring function.

Water molecules were present in some of the complexes; however their locations were not conserved among the different complexes. As it would have been impossible to keep them without biasing the self-docking of an inhibitor to its natural solvated receptor, they were not considered for the present docking study. Ideally, when performing virtual screening or de novo design of enzyme inhibitors, water molecules should be properly located or displaced by the docking program, a feature not implemented or in development in most of the available soft-

ware. To date, only FITTED can move and displace water molecules30,44 while GOLD can toggle their presence on or off.25 After addition of the hydrogen atoms to the crystal structures, the ligands were removed and the proteins were charged and prepared for their use in the subsequent docking study. Special attention was given to the catalytic site including two histidines, two aspartates, and a zinc ion. Although the formal charge of the zinc atom is þ2, it was clear that this charge was delocalized onto the chelating residues.45 The charges for the catalytic site residues and for the zinc atom were derived from density

functional theory (DFT) calculations of a truncated binding site and used for AutoDock, Glide, LigandFit, and FITTED. The van der Waals parameters for the zinc atom required for both the protein preparation and the docking study were obtained from the literature.45 For the following studies, the crystal-derived ligand structure (CLS) and/ or optimized energy-minimized ligand structure (MLS) were used as input. A comparative study aiming at identifying a program for future virtual screening of drug design could not provide useful results if CLS's were required as input. In a real drug design scenario, one does not know the final pose and would guess an input structure as MLS. As we will describe in the following sections, selection of the input structures has an impact on the accuracy of some of the docking programs.
Docking methods used in this comparative study and parameterization

Many comparative studies discussed in a recent review have shown Glide and GOLD to be amongst the most accurate docking programs.20 For instance, Rognan and coworkers46 ranked GOLD, Glide and Surflex as the most

accurate docking programs for their set, followed by FlexX. We have previously obtained good results for the docking of zinc-containing enzyme inhibitors with AutoDock.47,48 In addition, a recent review of eHiTS indicates that this docking program is a new candidate of interest.49 We decided to assess GOLD, Glide, FlexX, AutoDock, LigandFit, and eHiTS to see which one, if any, would provide accurate docking results for GMII inhibitors. To add to the validation of our own software, the current version of FITTED30 was also assessed. It is also worth noting that Glide, FlexX (FlexE), AutoDock, and FITTED have versions where flexibility of the protein is accounted for. Induced-fit docking using Glide/ Prime relies on a combination of rigid protein docking and homology modeling techniques to construct the backbone and residue side chains.50 FlexE relies on docking to composite structures,51 while AutoDock grids can be combined using appropriate weighting schemes into virtual conformational ensembles.52 The flexibility of the protein/ligand complexes in FITTED relies on the use of chromosomes to describe the whole complexes.30,53 A section on the use of these functionalities is included in this manuscript. The assessed programs covered a variety of conformational search methods: genetic algorithms (GOLD, AutoPROTEINS

Dock, and FITTED), incremental construction (FlexX), rigid fragment docking and linking (eHiTS), Monte Carlo/matching algorithm (LigandFit) and multilevel search (Glide) and a large panel of scoring functions (e.g., ChemScore, GlideScore, GoldScore, F-Score, AutoDock scoring function, PMF, RankScore). Some of the evaluated methods came with an interface that was used to prepare the protein and ligand structure and initial keyword files. However, to obtain the best performance from each docking program, the standalone versions with optimized parameters were used. In addition, although the computation of the atomic root mean square deviations (RMSD) was part of the output of Glide, FlexX, and FITTED, we made our own scripts to compute the RMSD's for the AutoDock and eHiTS studies. The deviations were evaluated using the CLS's as references, taking into account only the coordinates of the heavy atoms but accounting for equivalent atoms that can be exchanged by rotation. One of the main issues addressed is the evaluation of the metal coordination as all the assessed programs treat the metal/ligand interaction differently. Therefore the deviations of the docked ligand structures from the CLS's were also computed for the metal ligation (only for the one or two oxygen atoms bound to the metal center). As all these programs have been reported, we will describe them succinctly, emphasizing the way they treat binding to metal ions and solvation and their application to GMII.

atom representation of the binding site, and while Glide uses an exhaustive conformational search, FlexX builds up the ligand within the binding site by incremental construction.59 One similarity between Glide and FlexX is the possibility of using pharmacophore-like constraints to force specific interactions between the ligands and the receptor.60 Poses that do not satisfy the pharmacophoric constraints are removed. In the present work, we imposed the requirement that at least one zinc-binding atom of the ligand should interact with the zinc ion. The incremental construction algorithm accounts for the geometry of ligand­metal interactions but not for metal coordination geometry. The poses proposed by FlexX were submitted to rescoring by a panel of four scoring functions implemented in CScore, namely PMF, GoldScore, DockScore, and ChemScore. ChemScore includes a specific (but nondirectional) term for metal/ligand binding while there is no specific term for metal/ligand interaction in the FlexX, PMF, GoldScore, and DockScore scoring functions.
AutoDock 3.0 29,61

Glide uses a funnel-type of approach to search the conformational space and the best poses are scored using GlideScore,55 a scoring function derived from ChemScore.56 Among the many terms of this scoring function is a term accounting for metal-ligand interactions. However, this term is restricted to anionic ligands, single atom ligation (we will consider diols) and does not account for the specific geometry of metal­ligand complexes. In the present study, the ligands were neutral, and the metal ligation would therefore be modeled as purely electrostatic. GlideScore also includes a unique solvation term which accounts for solvation of solvent-exposed moieties as well as water molecules captured in hydrophobic protein pockets. Glide also proposes the use of constraints to force specific interactions. The user-defined constraints add an additional filter to the hierarchical filtering. To evaluate the impact of constraints on accuracy, two studies--with and without constraints--were carried out. Unexpectedly, filtering off the poses where no groups were in close proximity to the zinc ion did not significantly increase the accuracy of the binding mode prediction.
FlexX 1.1326,57,58/CScore59

The inhibitors, modeled using a united atom representation, are flexibly docked into the grids modeling the proteins by means of a Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA). The LGA optimizes the ligand pose to find the local minimum by perturbing the genes of the ligand. The scoring function available with the version 3.0 of this suite of programs does not include any specific term for metal­ligand interaction, the metals being treated as charged spheres with no specific coordination geometry. In contrast to other methods used herein, in the current version (version 4.0 is under validation62), no constraint can be specified.
GOLD 3.0 25,63

FlexX is conceptually very different to Glide. Rather than using grids, FlexX models the protein with an all-

GOLD also samples the ligand conformational space using a genetic algorithm (GA). However, in contrast to AutoDock, it uses the atomic description of the protein (or a truncated binding site) and allows for the hydroxyl (Ser, Thr, Tyr) and ammonium (Lys) hydrogen atoms to relax upon ligand docking. A large number of parameters can be optimized to improve the accuracy of the conformational search, although only a few were optimized in the present work according to the observed poses of initial runs (e.g., torsion angle distribution databases, constraints to direct the docking towards the observed binding modes, parameters for the GA, and user-defined scoring functions). Upon docking, GOLD makes use of virtual coordination points (which can be specified by the user) to model the chelation of metals, a potentially very important feature for GMII inhibitor docking. In this study, two possible metal coordination geometries were assessed (trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral). The

GOLD scoring function (GoldScore) as well as ChemScore do not consider the metal coordination geometry, the metal-ligand interaction strength being only distance dependent. As for Glide and FlexX, GOLD allows for the use of constraints (harmonic constraints) to direct and speed up the docking process.
eHiTS28,64

scoring function (RankScore) does not include any specific term for metal/ligand interactions which are treated as hydrogen bonds.53 Constraints are implemented in FITTED to direct the binding to a specific atom or group of atoms and will be used to select poses with metal chelation.
Application to the docking of mannosidase inhibitors

A recent software review revealed the high accuracy of eHiTS for docking small molecules to rigid proteins.49 This review together with a comparative study from the developers (Reid D, personal communication) prompted us to evaluate eHiTS in the prospect of accurately docking a-mannosidase inhibitors. The conformational search sampling is performed by rigid fragment docking followed by linkage and optimization of the reconstructed ligands. This approach, claimed to be ``truly exhaustive,'' is quite different from the methods used by the other programs described herein. The original scoring function is an empirical scoring function with many terms, including a specific term for angle-dependent metal coordination. However, although angles around the ligand atoms are considered, the metal coordination geometry is not optimized. This piece of software is still under development and only a very few parameters are accessible for modification by the user. While this manuscript was in preparation, a new and more accurate scoring function was implemented but has not been assessed in our study.65
LigandFit27,66

LigandFit first defines the binding site as a series of grid points used to locate the binding site, defines its shape and further docks the flexible ligands. The docking is performed by generating sets of ligand conformations using a Monte Carlo technique and matching these ligand conformations to the binding site partitions. Three scoring options are available, namely CFF and Dreiding force fields, as well as the PLP scoring function. Neither these two force fields nor PLP include a specific treatment of metal ligation. LigandFit also allows for additional constraints using filters. The LigandFit constraint matches a feature atom such as a polar hydrogen with a complementary ligand atom such as a hydrogen bond acceptor oxygen.
FITTED 1.030

To complete the comparative study, FITTED, a program recently developed in our laboratory has been assessed.30 FITTED exploits a LGA to model the flexibility of both the ligands and proteins. It also includes a specific function for displaceable water molecules. Unlike AutoDock, FITTED optimizes the ligand pose through a Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient minimization.66 The

The 10 selected weak to strong ligands were docked to the 10 protein structures using each of the assessed programs for a total of 100 docking runs (10 self-docking runs and 90 cross-docking runs) for each program. Thus, Glide/GlideScore, FlexX/FlexXScore, FlexX/PMF, FlexX/ GoldScore, FlexX/ChemScore, FlexX/DockScore, AutoDock/AutoDock scoring function, eHiTS/eHiTS scoring function, GOLD/GoldScore, GOLD/ChemScore, LigandFit/PLP, LigandFit/CFF, LigandFit/Dreiding, and FITTED/ RankScore were successively assessed. Figure 5 summarizes the collected data. The FlexX docking engine allowed us to evaluate the generated poses. Thus, when we considered the use of FlexX to dock inhibitors 1­10 into GMII, all the docked poses were kept for postdocking analysis and rescoring with four other scoring functions (DockScore,67 PMF,68 GoldScore,25 ChemScore56) included in the CScore module of Sybyl. Only the results with the ChemScore scoring function are shown as the other four functions were less accurate. In the present study, a pose with an ° RMSD below 2.0 A was generated in only 75% on the cases and was identified by the scoring function in less than 40% of the cases. This revealed that a significant portion of the failures was due to poor conformational sampling and not only to inaccurate scoring. Within GOLD, GoldScore was found to be marginally better than ChemScore. Interestingly, the use of ChemScore with GOLD and FlexX led to similar results while the enhanced version of ChemScore, GlideScore, led to significantly better accuracy when used in conjunction with Glide. LigandFit was found to be inaccurate when CFF or Dreiding force fields were used to score the generated poses. Unexpectedly, CLS provided significantly better results than MLS with eHiTS. When a simple rotation in space or a change in one torsion angle was applied to the CLS used as input structures, the accuracy dropped. Glide clearly appeared as the most accurate program in this comparative study. The ligands were docked with ° ° RMSD's below 1.0 A in 40% of the cases and below 2.0 A in 48%. eHiTS was much less accurate with an accuracy ° of 28% at 2.0 A RMSD, while the other five programs showed accuracies ranging from 32% (LigandFit) to nearly 40% (FITTED). We were also pleased to see that the accuracy of FITTED was equivalent to that of Glide ° at RMSD ¼ 2.5 A.

[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www.interscience.wiley.com.]

In general, the computed RMSD's indicated better accuracy for the self-docking of the smaller ligands 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 with all the programs. For instance, 1­5 were docked back to their protein structure (self-docking) ° with RMSD's below 1.1 A when the MLS's were used as input with the Glide program. These data are consistent with the results reported in the original Glide publication from Friesner et al. where nearly 50% of the compounds from the testing set were docked back with RMSD's ° below 1.0 A.24 In that same study, about a third of the ° compounds were docked with RMSD between 1.0­2.0 A, although in our case ligands 6­10 were self-docked with ° RMSD's higher than 2.5 A. To further evaluate the apparent poor docking accuracy observed for ligands 6­10, we inspected the docked and experimentally observed conformations.

First, we noticed that the experimentally observed zinc chelation by the diol or alcohol moieties was correctly predicted in almost all of the one hundred complexes when Glide was used, but with poorer accuracy when the other programs were used [Fig. 5(b)]. Second, a close look at the docked structures indicated that the docked pose was for the most part correct in many cases, the main deviation coming from the solventexposed moieties and the orientation of the aromatic groups. For instance, compound 8's phenyl group was predicted to interact with Arg228 through p interactions, while it was involved in a T-shaped p interaction with Trp95 in the crystal structure (see Fig. 6). In fact, none of the programs predicted the T-shaped interaction between the phenyl ring of 8 and Trp95. This was probably due to the poor description of this type of

interaction by the commonly used scoring functions. Nevertheless, the pyrrolidine ring was perfectly oriented [Fig. 6(a)] in all cases. Similar conclusions were drawn for compounds 9 and 10. As discussed above, the complex with 9 showed large B-factors for the phenyl ring and a poorly defined electron density map for this solvent-exposed group. The chelation by a single alcohol of 6 and 7 was predicted to occur by Glide [Fig. 6(b)], but the main deviation arose from the positioning of the solvent-exposed sulfate predicted to interact with Tyr267 and/or with Arg228 [Fig. 6(b)]. In the crystal structures, this moiety was solvated while not specifically interacting with a protein residue. Owing to the solvation/desolvation term of GlideScore, this situation was predicted in a few cross-docking situations (e.g., ligand 7 docked into 1HXK protein structure). When using minimized ligands as input, the ring conformation in the input structure was already different from the crystal structure. This structure optimization stage ° contributed to a small fraction of the RMSD (<0.3 A). Compounds in the crystal structures of dGMII were not in their lowest energy conformation but rather in a higher energy conformation induced by environmental constraints in the active site.32 The effect of the zinc ion and the active site environment on inhibitor distortion has recently been discussed.69
Metal ligation

° dicted with a deviation of less than 1.0 A relative to the crystal structure. Surprisingly, even though LigandFit was not among the most accurate docking programs, the metal ligation was fairly well predicted as shown in Figure 5(b). In contrast, FITTED was not very predictive when considering the metal chelation even though overall it ranked second. The lack of a specific metal binding term in the FITTED scoring function may be responsible for this observation. Overall, Glide clearly outperformed the other programs. As discussed above the apparent poor accuracy of nearly 50% should be taken with great care as most of the compounds were docked properly, the main deviation being attributed to the solvent-exposed moieties. When these moieties were not considered, accuracies higher than 90% were recorded with Glide. The other programs poorly predicted both the metal chelation and the location of the solvent-exposed groups.

Docking to conformational ensembles and flexible proteins

To further evaluate the program's ability to dock the GMII inhibitors, a closer inspection of the poses around the Zn cation was carried out. A clear indication of the predictive power of Glide was given by the computed RMSD's of the metal ligating groups [Fig. 5(b)]. In 54% and 91% of the cases (cross- and self-docking, respectively), the chelating alcohols or diols were positioned ° within 0.5 and 1.0 A of the observed positions respectively, even though this docking/scoring method did not account for coordination geometry. AutoDock suffered from the lack of constraints and in a few cases, 8 did not even interact with the zinc cation. The other programs offered the use of constraints to direct the docking and the zinc was chelated is most of the cases. Compounds 1, 3, and 5 were generally docked in a binding mode similar to the crystal structure but in a few cases a single alcohol was interacting with the metal, the second alcohol interacting with Asp204, or a different second hydroxyl group was chelating the zinc. Similarly, 2 was often docked with a single alcohol (e.g., O6) interacting with the metal. Interestingly, although the metal chelation was treated as a standard non-bonded interaction in AutoDock, only 5% of the docked structures did not involve the binding of at least one alcohol to the zinc atom. These observations were consistent with our previous report.47 However, the detailed geometry was not accurately predicted, with only 35% of the ligation being preDOI 10.1002/prot

Comparing the self-docking data to the cross-docking data revealed the sensitivity of the seven programs for the protein structure. Figure 7 shows a superposition of 5 of the 10 selected crystal structures. In this figure only the largest side chain moves are shown. For these five residues (Tyr727, Trp95, Arg228, Tyr269, and Asp92), ° moves of about 1 A for specific atoms were observed. ° The location of the zinc atom also varied. Although 1 A can be seen as negligible, it is roughly the size of an atom and can preclude the proper binding of a func-

multiple conformations was observed (data not shown). This indicated that the failures observed were not due to the flexibility of the protein, but to inherent limitations of the docking/scoring methods used by each of the programs evaluated.

When looking at the predicted activities of these weak to strong inhibitors with any of the programs assessed, the scores did not correlate well with the observed activities. The most active swainsonine (1) was predicted to be one of the least active inhibitors of the set with all the scoring functions. This revealed that the scoring functions used can accurately discriminate between the different poses, hence predicting reasonable binding modes, but not between compounds of different affinities. In fact, it is well known that the accuracy of current scoring functions for small compounds is still poor,70,71 with large compounds being often assigned higher scores than small compounds by most of the scoring functions.72

Virtual screening using Glide

tional group of the ligand, significantly affecting the docking accuracy. The clear dependence of the docking accuracy of ligands (i.e., 7 and 10) on the protein structure led us to consider docking to flexible proteins. One obvious method was to dock the compounds to the 10 protein structures. Then, the best scoring pose among the 10 docked structures for each inhibitor was considered. Using this approach (docking to multiple conformations), slight to good improvement was observed (Fig. 8). Again, Glide and FITTED appeared as the best two programs. However, these data were collected for only 10 ligands and should not be considered as representative of the overall accuracy of the assessed programs. At low ° RMSD's (below 1.0 A), LigandFit/PLP and Glide outperformed the other programs. Their ability to predict the zinc chelation allowed these two programs to very accurately predict the binding mode of the smallest inhibitors. We next looked at the flexible versions of the programs. An induced-fit docking protocol has recently been ¨ made available by Schrodinger.50 However, the average CPU time required for a single run exceeds 10 h and would therefore be a major limitation to the use of this protocol for drug design. We decided not to include this method in our study. Flexible protein versions of AutoDock52 and of FlexX, namely FlexE,51 have been proposed and were used together with FITTED30 as a complement to the cross-docking studies. However, no significant improvement comparatively to the docking to

We next turned our attention to the use of dockingbased virtual screening (VS) tool to screen potential amannosidase inhibitors. As discussed above, Glide/GlideScore was more accurate in predicting the correct binding mode than any of the other programs assessed. We therefore decided to restrict the VS study to Glide alone, as VS data from a program unable to provide the correct binding mode would be hard to interpret. However, although the overall accuracy of Glide was excellent, the apparent poor accuracy of the scoring function may be a hurdle in virtual screening. To evaluate the performance of Glide for VS, we seeded a library of decoys with previously reported GMII inhibitors and docked the complete library to a single dGMII protein structure. The protein structure from complex 1PS3 was found to be a fair representative (by visual inspection and comparison of active site side chain RMSD) of the set of 10 proteins used in the docking study, hence its selection as the target for the VS. Then, a set of 1000 decoys used by the ¨ Schrodinger team to benchmark Glide55 was seeded with 10 active compounds shown in Table IV. Compound 3 (protein 1PS3 natural ligand) was purposely not selected to prevent biasing self-docking. The activity for some of the compounds was measured on jack bean GMII, a common model for hGMII as discussed in the introduction. At first sight these active compounds 11­1773­79 can be viewed as poor inhibitors, however low micromolar inhibitors are considered strong inhibitors of GMII.80,81 In addition, one needs to bear in mind that the primary goal of a VS study is to discover micromolar lead compounds from large libraries and not nanomolar

compounds, which are often developed through lead optimization. Figure 9 shows the number of known hits retrieved when increasing the fraction of the ranked list. A charge of 1 or 2 (protonated amines) was assigned to each compound and alternate protonation modes were considered. For instance, compound 17 had to be monoprotonated to be able to properly chelate the zinc cation. The tetrazole ring of compound 13 could be protonated at different locations, or not at all, having an estimated pKa of around 5. The dark blue line in Figure 9 shows the accuracy of docking all the compounds with all the amines protonated and the tetrazole ring of 13 protonated at position 2. The light blue lines represent the results based on the best or worst scores of each compound when considering all the possible protonation states. Obviously, the final score did not take into account the energy required to change the protonation state from the one stable in solution to the one in the protein binding site. As can be seen in Figure 9, half of the active compounds were retrieved in the top 10% regardless of the protonation states selected. However, between 3 and 5 compounds were recovered in the top 2% depending on the chosen protonation states. We noticed that the protonation state was a critical factor to consider, as compounds with two amines (i.e., 1, 16, and 17) provided quite different scores with alternative protonation states. Overall, this was a very promising result that correlated well with the good performance of Glide in virtual screening studies.55 Using the same decoy set, Halgren et al. recovered from 50 to 90% of the actives in the top

ance of Glide, we carried out a VS study and were pleased to obtain enrichment factors in the range observed with nonmetal containing proteins. As previously observed, swainsonine, the most active inhibitor considered, was found to be the outlier of the set with a score much lower than less active inhibitors. In summary, using Glide, small inhibitors were docked ° with excellent accuracy (RMSD < 1.1 A), while larger inhibitors with solvent-exposed polar and nonpolar functional groups were docked with good accuracy (RMSD $ ° 2.5 A). More specifically, the zinc ligation was well predicted in most cases of self and cross-docking, while the largest deviations arose from the solvent-exposed moieties. Finally, we believe that the application of Glide to the VS of large libraries of compounds is a promising strategy for the discovery of novel GMII inhibitors.

10% with most of the proteins studied and less than 50% with p38 MAP kinase. Clearly, Glide is a promising tool for the virtual screening of a-mannosidase inhibitors considering the known poor performance of docking methods with metal-containing proteins. As can be seen in Table V, the most active compounds 1, 11, and 15 were assigned lower scores than less active inhibitors, which confirmed the lack of accuracy of GlideScore to rank some of the actives. Nevertheless, having 8 out of 10 seeded actives in the top 15% of the ranked library demonstrated that GlideScore is indeed appropriate for the retrieval of mannosidase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS In medicinal chemistry, crystallography and computational chemistry are well-established tools at the lead generation stage. We have described herein three new three-dimensional structures of Drosophila melanogaster Golgi a-mannosidase II:inhibitor complexes and their application to assessing the ability of seven available docking programs to predict the binding mode and binding affinity of a-mannosidase II inhibitors. Overall, Glide outperformed the other docking programs followed by FITTED, GOLD, AutoDock, and FlexX. eHiTS was found to be the least accurate. Unexpectedly, the prediction of the metal coordination geometry appeared to be best with Glide/GlideScore even compared to other programs that included a specific term for metal ligation and coordination geometries. Although the docked poses were often close to the observed binding modes, the predicted binding constants were not well correlated with the observed inhibition data. The highly active inhibitor swainsonine (1) was ranked among the least actives in most of the cases. We believe that metal ligation and solvation were not adequately evaluated in the tested scoring functions, and that large molecules were over-scored. To evaluate the impact of this apparently poor scoring on the perform-
