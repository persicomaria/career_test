The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains several carbohydrate-binding proteins, among which is the P. aeruginosa lectin I (PA-IL), which displays affinity for -galactosylated glycans. Glycan arrays were screened and demonstrated stronger binding of PA-IL toward Gal1­ 4Gal-terminating structures and weaker binding to Gal1­3Gal ones in order to determine which human glycoconjugates could play a role in the carbohydrate-mediated adhesion of the bacteria. This was confirmed in vivo by testing the binding of the lectin to Burkitt lymphoma cells that present large amounts of globotriaosylceramide antigen Gb3/CD77/Pk. Trisaccharide moieties of Gb3 (Gal1­4Gal1­4Glc) and isoglobotriaosylceramide (Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc) were tested by titration microcalorimetry, and both displayed similar affinity to PA-IL in solution. The crystal structure of PA-IL complexed to Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc trisaccharide has ´ been solved at 1.9-Å resolution and revealed how the second galactose residue makes specific contacts with the protein surface. Molecular modeling studies were performed in order to compare the binding mode of PA-IL toward Gal1­3Gal with that toward Gal1­4Gal. Docking studies demonstrated that Gal1­4Gal creates another network of contacts for achieving a very similar affinity, and 10-ns molecular dynamics in explicit water allowed for analyzing the flexibility of each disaccharide ligand in the protein binding site. The higher affinity observed for binding to Gb3 epitope, both in vivo and on glycan array, is likely related to the presentation effect of the oligosaccharide on a surface, since only the Gb3 glycosphingolipid geometry is fully compatible with parallel insertion of neighboring trisaccharide heads in two binding sites of the same tetramer of PA-IL.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterium responsible for numerous nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients for whom it may cause a wide number of diseases, such as septicaemia, urinary tract infections, pancreatitis, and dermatitis. The bacteria colonize patients with chronic lung diseases as well as those under mechanical ventilation, and these recurrent infections are often fatal for cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa produces a wide variety of carbohydratebinding proteins, including the soluble lectins I (PA-

IL; gene lecA) and II (PA-IIL; gene lecB), which are specific for galactose and fucose, respectively.1,2 The galactophilic lectin PA-IL was the first P. aeruginosa lectin to be isolated by affinity chromatography using a Sepharose column.3 It consists of 121 amino acids (12.75 kDa) associated in homotetramers.4 The crystal structures obtained in the absence and in the presence of calcium5,6 demonstrated that each monomer adopts a small -sandwich fold consisting of two curved sheets, each of four antiparallel -strands. The tetramer is assembled by 222-symmetry. The structure of the complex of PA-IL with galactose showed the presence of one calcium ion and one galactose ligand in the same binding site.5 Oxygen atoms O3 and O4 of galactose participate in the coordination of calcium, as observed in several galactose-specific C-type lectins7 and, more recently, in CEL-III, the -trefoil sea cucumber lectin.8 PA-IL is a virulence factor, and its expression is under the control of the "quorum sensing" system.9,10 The lectin is toxic for respiratory epithelial cells in primary culture.11 When associated with other toxins such as exotoxin A and elastase, the presence of PA-IL induced a high rate of mortality in a mouse model of gut-derived sepsis.12 PA-IL may be

involved in pathogen adhesion since it binds to seromucinous glands and to capillaries and small blood vessels in sections of mink lungs.13 Studies on P. aeruginosa mutants lacking or surproducing the lectin demonstrated its involvement in biofilm formation.14 This finding is in agreement with the high percentage of galactose residue present in the biofilm formed by enzyme of the psl locus.15 Nevertheless, the oligosaccharide epitopes that are involved in these different processes have not yet been characterized. PA-IL has medium-range affinity for galactose, with an association constant (Ka) of 3.4 × 104 M- 1 as reported from an equilibrium dialysis study.16 When longer epitopes are considered, the lectin has a preference for -linked terminal galactose. Competition assays with disaccharides indicate strong affinity for Gal1­6Glc (melibiose), slightly higher than that for Gal1­4Gal (galabiose) and that for Gal1­3Gal.17 PA-IL efficiently agglutinates erythrocytes with blood group B (Gal1­3[Fuc1­ 2]Gal1­4GlcNAc-R), blood group Pk equivalent to the globotriaosylceramide Gb3/CD77 antigen18 (Gal1­4Gal1­4Glc-Cer), and P1 (Gal1­4Gal1­ 4GlcNAc1­3Gal1­4Glc-Cer).19 Dual recognition of Gal1­4Gal and Gal1­3Gal capped glyco-

sphingolipids was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC).20 In the present work, we characterize the specificity and affinity of PA-IL for Gal1­4Gal and Gal1­3Gal epitopes by cell surface labeling combined with glycan array analysis and titration microcalorimetry. The crystal structure of PA-IL complexed with Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc trisaccharide establishes the atomic basis of the specificity and reveals how the second galactose residue makes specific contacts with the protein surface. Docking studies demonstrate that Gal1­4Gal creates another network of contacts for achieving a very similar affinity. Finally, 20-ns molecular dynamics (MD) in explicit water allows for analyzing the flexibility of each disaccharide ligand in the protein binding site.

Results
Cell surface labeling by PA-IL and anti-Gb3/CD77 monoclonal antibody So far, most studies on the cellular specificity of PA-IL have been conducted by hemagglutination

tests on erythrocytes or by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of various animal tissues. In both techniques, the cellular membrane is modified as compared with live cells. We therefore decided to take advantage of the high expression of the glycolipid antigen Gb3/CD77 (Gal1­4Gal1­ 4Glc-Cer) on Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells21,22 to analyze the binding of PA-IL on these live cells and to compare it with anti-Gb3/CD77 monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactivity. Ten Burkitt cell lines were thus labeled with an anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb (1A4) or PA-IL, and their binding capacities were compared by flow cytometry. Five representative BL cell lines (Ramos, P3HR1, BL41, Seraphina, and LY47) and a T-cell line (Jurkat) are shown in Fig. 1. Gb3/CD77 was highly expressed on Ramos, P3HR1, and BL41, faintly expressed on Seraphina and Jurkat, and not detectable on LY47 cells (as demonstrated with 1A4 mAb labeling). In the case of labeling with PA-IL, all cell lines except LY47 were highly positive. Thus, four cell lines have a similar staining pattern with PA-IL and anti-Gb3/CD77, suggesting that this glycolipid may serve as a receptor for the lectin. However, PA-IL seems to recognize another epitope on Seraphina and Jurkat cell surfaces.

840 Glycolipid recognition by PA-IL

Recognition of Globo- and Isoglobo-Series by Bacterial Lectin

In order to determine if PA-IL may bind Gal moiety of glycoproteins, we performed Western blot analysis of the cell line lysates with biotinylated PAIL. We were not able to detect any specific staining especially for Seraphina and Jurkat cells (data not shown). Binding of PA-IL to lower-phase glycolipids obtained from the BL cell lines was studied by TLC immunostaining in order to confirm that the lectin recognizes Gb3. Chemical detection of glycoconjugates with orcinol (Fig. 2a) revealed that all cell lines contain low or very low amounts of a compound that had the same mobility as lactosylceramide (LacCer). Ramos and BL41 cells contain large amounts of a glycolipid that co-migrates with Gb3. Seraphina cells contain a lower amount, whereas this glycolipid is not detectable in Jurkat and LY47 cells. TLC immunostaining was performed with biotinylated PA-IL. Figure 2b shows that PA-IL does not bind standard Gb4 (GalNAc1­3Gal1­4Gal1­4Glc11Cer) but possesses high affinity for standard Gb3 (Gal1­4Gal1­4Glc1-1Cer) and surprisingly binds to standard LacCer (Gal1­4Glc1-1Cer). Among the various LP extracts tested, glycolipids from Ramos, Seraphina, and BL41 are recognized by PA-IL, whereas no staining was detected for Jurkat and LY47. It must be noted that PA-IL staining perfectly matches the orcinol detection of Gb3 for Ramos and BL41 glycolipids, whereas PA-IL immunostaining and orcinol staining are slightly different in the case of Seraphina cells. Indeed, although orcinol stained a glycolipid that co-migrates with Gb3, PA-IL recognizes a compound with a slightly

higher mobility than Gb3. Thus, these results confirm previous data obtained by Lanne et al.20 showing that PA-IL is able to bind Gb3 in TLC immunostaining and that there may be another glycolipid with mobility close to Gb3 recognized by the lectin. Isoglobotriaosylceramide (iGb3; Gal1­3Gal1­ 4Glc1-1Cer) is an isomer of Gb3 with the same mobility on TLC as Gb3.23 We therefore tested the binding capacity of the lectin for this glycolipid by TLC immunostaining. Orcinol staining revealed that chemically synthesized iGb3 has a slightly lower migration than Gb3 purified from human erythrocytes (Fig. 2c). This difference may be explained by the chain length of their respective ceramide moiety. Staining with PA-IL showed that the lectin is also able to recognize iGb3, albeit more weakly than Gb3 (Fig. 2d). Whether or not iGb3 is the compound recognized on the cell surface of the Seraphina cells remains to be determined. Specificity of PA-IL by glycan array screening Oligosaccharide specificity of PA-IL has been determined by glycan array experiments at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (Fig. 3). The screening results against 241 glycan epitopes show high specificity of PA-IL toward terminal -galactoside, with the highest preference for Gal1­4Gal, typical for Gb3/P k and P1 antigens. Terminal galactose in 1­6 and 1­3 linkages is also recognized, albeit with a lower observed binding. PA-IL does not display any significant binding to galactosides as can be seen from glycan array results.

Color coding of the histograms is as follows: green for Gal1­4 terminal residues; purple for Gal1­3; light blue for Gal1­4; and orange for Gal1­6.

The only exception observed was with Gal1­ 4GlcNAc1­3Gal1­4GlcNAc-Sp1 (LN2) and Gal1­4GlcNAc1­3Gal1­4Glc-Sp1(LNnT) epitopes, for which a significant amount of bound lectin was still detectable even after extensive washing. There is no any rational explanation for the binding of Gal1­4GlcNAc epitope as the same terminal LacNAc motif is present in 15 other screened oligosaccharides. It may indicate that PAIL can bind -galactosides with negligible affinity but that high-density surface presentation of the Gal epitopes and lectin multivalency could lead to observable binding. Affinity studies by isothermal titration microcalorimetry The affinity constant and the thermodynamic binding parameters were determined using titration microcalorimetry, a method that is well suited to the characterization of protein­carbohydrate interactions, in order to characterize the interaction between PA-IL and Gal-containing compounds.24 Titration curves for PA-IL binding to Gal1­4Ga1­ 4Glc and Gal1­3Ga1­4Glc are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 1S. Surprisingly, the lectin has very similar Ka values for the two trisaccharides (68­ 77 M) (Table 1). This value is slightly higher than the one previously reported for the PA-IL/Gal interaction by equilibrium dialysis study.16 For both disaccharides, the interaction is enthalpy driven, with an unfavorable entropy contribution. Crystal structure of PA-IL/Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc trisaccharide Co-crystals of the lectin and Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc trisaccharide were obtained in space group P1 ´ ´ with cell dimensions of a = 79.2 Å , b = 86.5 Å , ´ ,  = 93.9°,  = 98.2°, and  = 90.1° (Table c = 119.1 Å 2). The asymmetric unit consists of 24 PA-IL monomers arranged in 6 tetramers, each centered on a pseudo-C222 axis (Fig. 4a). This resulted in the refinement of 2904 amino acids, 3048 water molecules, 20 ethylene glycol molecules, 24 calcium ions, and 72 carbohydrate residues with an Rcrys of 18.5% and an Rfree of 24.5% to 1.9-Å resolution. As previously described,5 each monomer adopts a small -sandwich fold consisting of two curved sheets, each consisting of four antiparallel -strands. Tetramerization occurs by interaction between the largest sheets for one interface and by contacts between C-terminus moieties for the other interface. In the carbohydrate binding site, clear density can be seen in each monomer corresponding to one calcium ion and one trisaccharide (Fig. 4b). The nonreducing Gal residue is buried in the binding site and participates in the coordination of the calcium ion through oxygen atoms O3 and O4. These two atoms also establish hydrogen bonds with Tyr36, Asp100, Thr104, Asn107, and Asn108 (Fig. 4c and Table 3). The position of the sugar is also stabilized by oxygen O2, which creates a hydrogen

bond with the nitrogen atom of Asn107. In addition, the O6 oxygen interacts with the side chains of Glu53 and His50. Oxygen O6 also participates in a water-bridged contact through a water molecule that is conserved in the 24 monomers. This structural water molecule makes hydrogen bonds with the Pro51 main chain oxygen and Glu53 main chain nitrogen. The hydrophobic contacts are rather limited since only the CH group at C2 interacts with the side chain of Tyr61. The calcium ion is heptacoordinated with five contacts to protein side chains and two contacts to galactose oxygen atoms (Table 3). The overall orientation of galactose relative to the calcium ion and protein residues is very similar to that observed in the complex between PA-IL and galactose.5 Additional contacts are established by the second galactose between the oxygen O2 and the nitrogen of Gln53. The glucose made interaction with Gln53 through the O4 atom involved in the glycosidic linkage between galactose rings. This hydrogen bond is rather weak and is not observed

in all monomers of the asymmetric unit. The glucose orientation appears to be mainly stabilized by a hydrophobic contact between C6 and Pro51. Analysis of the conformations adopted by the trisaccharide in PA-IL binding sites reveals no large variation among the 24 independent molecules. All carbohydrate rings are in the expected 4C1 conformation with no significant distortion. As for exocyclic groups, the -galactose that is buried in the binding site displays only one orientation of the

hydroxymethyl in all the 24 monomers (O5­C5­C6­ O6, ca + 60°), due to its stabilization by several hydrogen bonds. In the two other monosaccharides, a variety of orientations are observed for the O6 hydroxymethyl groups. Both Gal1­3Gal and Gal1­4Glc disaccharides have been previously demonstrated to adopt several conformations at the glycosidic linkages when in solution.25,26 The energy map of Gal1­3Gal calculated as a function of torsion angles  (O5­C1­O1­C3) and  (C1­O1­

low-energy region reported for the lactose energy map.26 Molecular modeling of PA-IL interacting with Gal1­3Gal and Gal1­4Gal disaccharides Possible conformations of the two disaccharides The possible conformation of the two linkages of interest can be investigated by calculating the MM3 glycosidic linkage energy maps as a function of rotation about the two bonds while taking into account the flexibility of each ring as described previously.27 This so-called flexible energy map of the Gal1­3Gal linkage has been previously calculated in our group.28 The Gal1­4Gal linkage was calculated using the same approach. Both maps exhibit several low-energy regions (Fig. 5). For both disaccharides, the flexibility around the  torsion angle is more restricted than that around the  torsion angle due to exoanomeric effect. The Gal1­ 3Gal disaccharide exhibits two main energy minima (/  80°/80° and /  100°/140°) separated by a low-energy barrier and a remote secondary energy minimum (/  100°/- 70°) with a higher energy barrier. In the present structure of PA-IL/ trisaccharide complex, the observed 24 conformations lie in a narrow range of  = 98° (± 4) and  = 122° (± 6), corresponding to the saddle region between the two main energy minima. The Gal1­ 4Gal disaccharide displays a plateau of low energy, with  and  varying from 80° to 100° and from 90° to 180°, respectively. This behavior is independent from the hydration model used in the calculations, as recently demonstrated for this disaccharide with the use of the CHARMM program.29 The only

crystal structure available for Gal1­4Gal is that of the isolated disaccharide,30 with its conformation (/ = 98°/158°) belonging to the low-energy region displayed in Fig. 5. Docking of disaccharides onto PA-IL Both Gal1­3Gal and Gal1­4Gal disaccharides were docked onto PA-IL using the AutoDock 3 program together with parameters recently validated for calcium-dependant carbohydrate binding.31 In both cases, several possible docking modes were observed among the 100 independent runs. Nevertheless, a high prediction quality was obtained since the lowest energy docking mode always corresponds to a highly populated cluster, indicating good convergence of results (Table 4). Results obtained with the Gal1­3Gal disaccharide validate our docking approach since the lowest energy docking mode corresponds closely to the interaction observed in the crystal structure of the PA-IL/trisaccharide complex (Fig. 6a). The nonreducing Gal coordinates the calcium ion with ´ distances of 2.3 and 2.6 Å from oxygen O3 and oxygen O4, respectively. It establishes the same hydrogen-bond network as in the crystal except for the O6 hydroxymethyl group that adopts a different orientation and, consequently, different contacts. The reducing Gal establishes hydrogen bonds with His50 and Gln53 that stabilize this conformation. The conformation at the glycosidic linkage is also correctly predicted (/ = 95°/126°), corresponding to the ones observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 5). The second binding mode (10%) is not very different, reproducing correctly the nonreducing galactose in the binding site. Other runs yield completely different binding modes, but the associated energies are significantly higher. Docking prediction for Gal1­4Gal in PA-IL also yields a low-energy conformation with a highly populated cluster (50%) and correct positioning of the nonreducing Gal on the calcium ion (Table 4). This docking mode presents the same hydrogenbond network for the nonreducing residue as observed for the Gal1­3Gal complex (Fig. 6b). By contrast, the reducing Gal is positioned very

differently from its position in the other disaccharide, which is expected due to the difference of the stereochemistry at the linkage axial­equatorial for 1­3 and axial­axial for 1­4. The reducing galactose finds a certain stability creating hydrogen bonds with His50 and Gln53. The conformation at the glycoside linkage (/ = 83°/122°) lies in the center of the low-energy region of the energy map (Fig. 5), indicating that no distortion of the disaccharide is needed for binding in this orientation. The other docking modes are energetically unfavorable and do not yield a correct interaction between the Gal residue and the calcium ion. MD in the presence of water molecules MD calculations were performed in explicit water in order to estimate the flexibility of each disaccharide into PA-IL binding site. Simulations of 10 ns were conducted on the monomer of PA-IL corresponding to 1762 atoms of proteins, one calcium ion, and 45 atoms of each disaccharide in 6187 and 5877 water molecules for Gal1­3Gal and Gal1­4Gal, respectively. Stability was checked over time, with the global RMS varying less than 1 Å from starting structures, therefore confirming that PA-IL is stable as a monomer. For both disaccharides, the nonreducing galactose and the calcium ions remain very stable in the protein binding site. Distances between calcium ion and the O3 and O4 hydroxyl groups did not show variations of more than ± 0.3 Å from the mean value of 2.46 Å (Table 5). For each disaccharide, the analysis was therefore focused on the conformation at the glycosidic linkage and the contacts between the external galactose and the protein surface. A video representing the movement of the disaccharides and neighboring amino acids is provided in Supplementary Material. Behavior of Gal1­3Gal disaccharide in PA-IL binding site The history of the  and  variations of the Gal1­ 3Gal glycosidic linkage during the 10-ns simulation is depicted in Fig. 7.

The  angle of this disaccharide is characterized by more freedom, varying between 60° and 180° during the simulation, corresponding to the two main energy minima of the energy map (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, 45% of recorded values are between 100° and 140° (average value = 109.2°), confirming that the saddle point between the minima (i.e., the conformations observed in the crystal structure of the complex and predicted by docking) is the most stable one in the PA-IL binding site. Snapshot 1, selected in this major conformation (Fig. 7), demonstrates the major role of the interaction between the external Gal residue and amino acids His50 and Gln53. More detailed analysis (Table 5) confirms that the hydrogen bonds between the reducing Gal and

these two amino acids are very stable (N30% of the trajectory). Nevertheless, the disaccharide can adopt very different conformations, such as the one displayed by snapshot 2. Behavior of Gal1­4Gal disaccharide in PA-IL binding site The disaccharide Gal1­4Gal is globally more static during the MD simulation, with 88% of the  angle value between 60° and 100° and 66% of the  angle between 100° and 140° (Fig. 8). This very stable conformation, depicted in snapshot 1, corresponds closely to the one predicted by the docking procedure. Nevertheless, some variations of the value of  are observed, either toward lower values (90°) or, more rarely, to higher values (150°; see

snapshot 2), corresponding to the conformation of the disaccharide in solid state.30 The whole range of the low-energy plateau calculated with MM3 (Fig. 5) is therefore explored during the simulation, but with strong preference for values (/  90°/130°), that corresponds to the stronger hydrogen-bond network. Indeed, the high occupancy of the hydrogen bond between the atom NE2 of His50 and Gal O3 (64.3%) together with the interaction between the side chain of Gln53 and Gal O3 and Gal O2 (41.3%) explained the reduced flexibility of the reducing monomer of Gal1­4Gal (Fig. 8).

Discussion
The present study provides the atomic basis for the previously reported affinity of PA-IL for Gal-bearing oligosaccharides. Indeed, PA-IL agglutinates human erythrocytes that bear the B epitope (terminated by Gal1­3Gal) more strongly than the A- and O(H)type ones.19 The lectin can also be used for differentiation between P-positive (P1 and Pk both bearing Gal1­4Gal) and P-negative (p) red blood cells.32 In solution, we demonstrated that both Gal1­4Gal1­ 4Glc and Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc trisaccharides bind to the lectin with very similar medium-range affinity [Kd

(dissociation constant) = 65­85 M], and structural work confirms the occurrence of hydrogen bonds with the second galactose in both cases. However, in the glycan array experiments, PA-IL binds much more efficiently to Gal1­4Gal- than to Gal1­3Gal-containing oligosaccharides; this is confirmed by the labeling of Burkett cells. It is therefore very likely that the presentation of glycolipids on the cell surface (or glycoconjugates on the microarray slide) strongly influences the binding. PA-IL is a tetramer with a rectangular shape; on the small face, two binding sites ´ are 30 Å apart (Fig. 9a). Higher affinity could occur if the glycolipids have the appropriate presentation for multivalency. Indeed, when building the sphingolipids from the complexes determined by crystallography and modeling, only the Gal1­4Gal1­ 4Glc binding mode is compatible with a correct parallel orientation of the lipid tails in the close binding sites of the PA-IL tetramer (Fig. 9b). In mammals other than humans and apes, the Gal1­3Gal antigen is abundantly expressed on erythrocytes and endothelial cells.33 PA-IL was successfully used for labeling epithelia and endothelia in mice and mink models,13,34 and it may have application in xenotransplantation research. In healthy humans, the Gal1­3Gal disaccharide is mostly associated to blood group B antigen, whereas there is no direct biochemical evidence for the expression of iGb3. However, iGb3 was recently proposed to be one of the candidates recognized by human natural killer T cells under pathophysiological conditions, such as cancer and autoimmune disease,35 and its direct lysosomal precursor (iGb4) was detected in human thymus by ion-trap mass spectrometry.36 It will therefore be of great interest to determine if iGb3 is expressed in the Seraphina cells. On the contrary, the activity of Gb3 synthase has been clearly identified in tissues of several human and mice organs. 37,38 Gb3 is not only highly expressed on a narrow range of lymphocytes and associated B-cell lymphomas22,39 but also a more general cancer-related marker. Shiga toxin-1 (also called verotoxin-1) displays a very fine specificity for Gb3 and its B-subunits are presently used not only to label cancer cells but also to induce apoptosis of cancer or to elicit antitumor immunity.40­42 PA-IL specificity has a somewhat broader specificity than verotoxin since it also weakly recognizes Gal1­ 3Gal epitope, but the lectin has potential applications for cell typing and/or tumor targeting. In addition, the fine characterization of molecular basis for disaccharide specificity will be an aid for the development of high-affinity ligands that may be used as antiadhesive compounds against infection by P. aeruginosa.43,44

(Seattle, WA). Biotinylated PA-IL was generated using a FluoReporter ® Mini-Biotin-XX Protein Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes). A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated goat F(ab)2 antimouse (Caltag Laboratories) was used for detection of 1A4 mAb, and biotinylated PA-IL was revealed with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (DakoCytomation). Purified glycolipids used as controls (LacCer, Gb3, Gb4) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and isoGb3 was kindly provided by Dr A. Bendelac (Chicago, IL). PPMP was obtained from Matreya. Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc trisaccharide was purchased from Carbohydrate Synthesis. PA-IL cloning and production The recombinant protein PA-IL was cloned using following procedure: The lecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA from P. aeruginosa ATCC 33347 as a template with the primers 5-CGG AGA TCA CAT ATG GCT TGG AAA GG-3 and 5-CCG AGA CAA GCT TTC AGG ACT CAT CC-3 (NdeI and HindIII restriction sites are underlined). After digestion with NdeI and HindIII, the amplified fragment was introduced into pET25(b+) vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), resulting in plasmid pET25pa1l.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the pET25pa1l plasmid were grown in 1 l of Luria broth at 37 °C. When the culture reached an optical density of 0.5­0.6 at 600 nm, isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were harvested after a 3-h incubation at 30 °C, washed, and resuspended in 10 ml of the loading buffer (20 mM Tris­HCl and 100 M CaCl2, pH 7.5). The cells were broken by cell disruption (Constant Cell Disruption System, UK). After centrifugation at 10,000g for 1 h, the supernatant was further purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). PA-IL was eluted with 1 M NaCl in loading buffer. The purified protein was intensively dialyzed against distilled water for 7 days, lyophilized, and kept at - 20 °C. Cell lines All cell lines were originally established from endemic or sporadic cases of human BL, except Jurkat, which was derived from a human T lymphoma. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 mM glucose, and 20 g/ml of gentamicin and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.

Seraphina PPMP were obtained after 10 days of culture in media containing 2 M D,L-threo-PPMP (D,L-threo-1-phenyl2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol HCl), a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor causing reversible glycolipid depletion. Surface immunofluorescence labeling Cells (3 × 105) were incubated with 50 l of primary reagent (1A4 mAb or biotinylated PA-IL) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with 50 l of secondary reagent for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Glycolipid purification and TLC Glycolipids were extracted from 150 × 106 cells sonicated twice in isopropanol/hexane/water (55:25:20, v/v/v). After centrifugation at 500g, supernatants were dried under N2 and then partitioned according to Folch's procedure. Folch's lower phase (LP) and upper phase (UP) were dried under N2. UPs were purified on C18 Bond Elut cartridge (Varian). After elution with methanol and chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), glycolipids were dried

under N2. LP and UP glycolipids were then taken in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) in a quantitative manner: 50 l for 1 × 108 cells. Glycolipids were separated on HighPerformance TLC plates (EM Science Merck) using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water containing 0.05% CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v/v). For chemical detection of glycolipids, TLC plates were sprayed with 0.5% orcinol in 10% sulfuric acid and then heated at 120 °C for 10 min. For TLC immunostaining, dried plates were blocked for 2 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) at room temperature and reacted overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated PA-IL (2.5 g/ml in PBS 0.5% BSA). After washing, plates were incubated for 1 h with 125I-labeled streptavidin (GE Healthcare) (0.2 Ci/ml in PBS 0.5% BSA). Plates were washed, dried, and submitted to autoradiography. Protein crystallization and data collection Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method using 2-l drops containing a 50:50 (v/v) mix of protein and reservoir solution at 20 °C. Lyophilized protein was dissolved in water (10 mg ml- 1) and incubated for 1 h with Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc (0.297 mM) at room temperature prior to co-crystallization. Crystals of the complex were obtained after optimization of condition 23 of the Clear Strategy Screen II (Molecular Dimension

Limited) using 10% polyethylene glycol 5KMME, 25 mM KSCN, and 100 mM NaAc, pH 4.6. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K, and 30% ethylene glycol was used as cryoprotectant. Crystals belong to space group P1 with 24 subunits per asymmetric unit. Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at station ID14-1 and on an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector. The data were processed using MOSFLM45 and scaled and converted to structure factors using SCALA. All further computing was performed using the CCP4 suite unless otherwise stated.46 Structure solution and refinement Molecular replacement technique was used to solve the structure with PHASER,47 using the tetrameric coordinates of PA-IL structure with calcium (Protein Data Bank code 1L7L) as the search model. Six tetramers were found, but since their 222-fold symmetry has been broken, the position of the 24 monomers was optimized by rigidbody refinement. Five percent of the observations were set aside for cross-validation analysis,48 and hydrogen atoms were added in their riding positions and used for geometry and structure-factor calculations. The structure was refined by restrained maximum-likelihood refinement using REFMAC49 iterated with manual rebuilding

in Coot.50 The incorporation of the ligand was performed after inspection of the mFo - DFc weighted maps, and the initial maps revealed clear density for at least one or two galactose residues of the Gal1­3Gal1­4Glc moiety. Water molecules were introduced automatically using Coot and inspected manually. The stereochemical quality of the model was assessed with the program Procheck,51 and coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under code 2VXJ. Molecular drawings were prepared using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). Glycan microarray analysis PA-IL was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-TFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified on a D-salt polyacrylamide desalting column (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Alexa-labeled PA-IL was used to probe on the glycan array version 3.8. The concentration of PA-IL used was 30 g/ml and followed the standard procedure of Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics.

Microcalorimetry

Recognition of Globo- and Isoglobo-Series by Bacterial Lectin

Purified and lyophilized PA-IL was dissolved in buffer (0.1 M Tris­HCl buffer containing 3 M CaCl2, pH 7.5) at a concentration of 0.05 mM and degassed. Protein concentration was checked by measurement of optical density using a theoretical molarity extinction coefficient of 28,000 (1 cm). Carbohydrate ligands were dissolved directly into the same buffer at a concentration of 1.7 mM, degassed, and placed in the injection syringe. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed with a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter from MicroCal Incorporated. PA-IL was placed into the 1.4478-ml sample cell, at 25 °C, using 10-l injections of carbohydrate every 300 s. Carbohydrate ligand was also titrated into buffer alone. Data were fitted with MicroCal Origin 7 software, according to standard procedures. Fitted data yielded the Ka and the enthalpy of binding (H). Other thermodynamic parameters (i.e., changes in free energy, G, and entropy, S) were calculated from the equation: DG ¼ DH À TDS ¼ RTlnKa where T is the absolute temperature and R=8.314 J·mol- 1·K- 1. Two to three independent titrations were performed for each ligand tested. Molecular mechanics calculations of disaccharides Adiabatic maps were calculated for Gal1­3Gal and Gal1­4Gal disaccharides taking into account the glycosidic linkages, defined by the torsion angles  = O5­C1­O1­CX,  = C1­O1­CX­CX + 1, and  = O5­ C5­C6­O6 through a rotation in 20° increments over the whole angular range. The 16 individual relaxed maps were computed for each disaccharide with different starting geometries of the pendent groups: two staggered positions of the hydroxymethyl groups (gt and tg) and the clockwise and counterclockwise orientations of the secondary hydroxyl groups. At each step of the conformational search, geometry optimization of the disaccharide was performed applying the MM3 force field52 that has been demonstrated to be well adapted to carbohydrate specificity.53 The structure relaxation was performed using a block diagonal method with the convergence termination criterion of n×0.00008 kcal/mol per five iterations, where n is the number of atoms. A dielectric constant of 78.5 was used in all the calculations in order to reproduce an aqueous environment. The isoenergy contour maps were then visualized using the program XFarbe.54 Docking of disaccharides in PA-IL Automated docking simulations were conducted with the AutoDock 3.05 suite of programs.55 The crystallographic structure of one monomer of PA-IL was used for the preparation of the receptor input file in Sybyl 7.3 (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen atoms were added in the structure, and positions of atoms were optimized through an energy minimization with TRIPOS force field.56 Disaccharide ligands were constructed with Sybyl, and charges were assigned according to the PIM parameters for the TRIPOS force field.57 Receptor atomic solvation parameters and fragmental volumes were assigned using the program addsol included in AutoDock. Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals

interactions were modeled using 12-10 and 12-6 Lennard­Jones parameters, respectively. Calcium atom was defined as a new atom type as recently described.31 Electrostatic grid maps with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å and 60 grid points were centered on the ligand. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm and the pseudo-Solis and Wets methods were applied using default parameters. The number of energy evaluations was set to 1 million in all docking jobs. The 20 best docking poses for the ligand Gal1­3Gal and the 100 best docking conformations for the ligand Gal1­4Gal were taken into account for calculating the clustering histograms generated. Building of sphingolipids based on the best docking solutions was performed as recently described.58 MD simulations Ten-nanosecond MD simulations of the disaccharides Gal1­3Gal and Gal1­4Gal were performed using AMBER 8 package (University of California). The starting structures of these simulations were a PA-IL monomer complexed with a calcium ion and a disaccharide as derived from AutoDock results, using the lowest energy conformations that always belong to the most populated cluster from the histograms. For the simulation, the AMBER force field parm9959 was used for the lectin, while for carbohydrates, parameters were taken from the GLYCAM06 force field,60 with partial charges calculated at the HF/6-31G level followed by an RESP fitting. The calcium ion was considered as an individual atom with two positive charges, a van der Waals radius of 1.79 Å, and a well depth of 0.014 kcal/mol.61 The Xleap module of AMBER was used for preparing the input files, including the addition of hydrogen atoms, the electrostatic neutralization, and the solvation of the systems. The PA-IL/Gal1­3Gal and PA-IL/Gal1­ 4Gal systems were immersed in a bath of TIP3P water molecules to a depth of 10 Å. The equilibration of the system was carried out through energy minimization of water molecules (500 steps of steepest descendent and 500 steps of conjugate gradient) with restraints on the solute atoms followed by 80-ps-long MD simulations, warming the system to 298 K. The equilibration phase continued with an energy minimization of the total systems without restraints. The systems were warmed from 10 to 298 K during 70 ps of MD followed by 130 ps of dynamics at constant temperature and constant pressure of 1 atm. The MD production phase was developed during 10 ns under a constant pressure of 1 atm and a constant temperature of 298.15 K controlled by the Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps- 1. During the simulations, SHAKE algorithm62 was turned on and applied to all hydrogen atoms and the particlemesh Ewald method was used for treating the electrostatic interactions, with a cutoff of 10 Å. An integration time step of 2 fs was employed. Minimization, equilibration, and production phases were carried out by SANDER module, while the analyses of the simulations were performed using the Ptraj module of AMBER 8. The visualization of the trajectories was performed using VMD software.63 Data processing and two-dimensional plots were created using Scilab and Xmrg software.
