Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi 110029, India This is the first crystal structure of a proteolytically generated functional C-lobe of lactoferrin. The purified samples of iron-saturated C-lobe were crystallized in 0.1 M Mes buffer (pH 6.5) containing 25% (v/v) polyethyleneglycol monomethyl ether 550 M and 0.1 M zinc sulphate heptahydrate. The X-ray intensity data were collected with 300 mm imaging plate scanner mounted on a rotating anode generator. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of the C-terminal half of bovine lactoferrin as a search model and refined to an ° R-factor of 0.193 for all data to 1.9 A resolution. The final model comprises 2593 protein atoms (residues 342­ 676 and 681 ­ 685), 124 carbohydrate atoms (from ten monosaccharide units, in three glycan chains), one Fe3þ, one CO22, two Zn2þ and 230 water molecules. The overall folding of the 3 C-lobe is essentially the same as that of C-terminal half of bovine lactoferrin but differs slightly in conformations of some of the loops and reveals a number of new interactions. There are 20 Cys residues in the C-lobe forming ten disulphide links. Out of these, one involving Cys481° Cys675 provides an inter-domain link at 2.01 A while another Cys405Cys684 is formed between the main C-lobe 342-676 and the hydrolyzed pentapeptide 681-685 fragment. Six inter-domain hydrogen bonds have been observed in the structure whereas only four were reported in the structure of intact lactoferrin, although domain orientations have been found similar in the two structures. The good quality of electron density has also revealed all the ten oligosaccharide units in the structure. The observation of two metal ions at sites other than the iron-binding cleft is another novel feature of the present structure. These zinc ions stabilize the crystal packing. This structure is also notable for extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the crystals. Therefore, the present structure appears to be one of the best packed crystal structures among the proteins of the transferrin superfamily.

Introduction
Lactoferrin is a bilobal glycoprotein that contains two homologous metal-binding sites with high affinities for ferric iron.1 It plays an essential role in iron homeostasis in vertebrates, controlling the levels of free iron in body fluids.2 ­ 4 The iron-binding sites are situated in the inter-domain clefts. The requirement for an anion, bound synergistically with the Fe ion is a unique feature of lactoferrin. Iron release can occur at low pH and is associated with a large-scale

Structure of Monoferric C-lobe of Bovine Lactoferrin

conformational change in which the two domains that enclose each iron-binding site move wide apart. The crystal structures of iron-saturated human lactoferrin (HLF),5,6 bovine lactoferrin (CLF),7 equine lactoferrin (ELF),8,9 buffalo lactoferrin (BLF)10,11 and iron-free human apolactoferrin (HALF),12,13 equine apolactoferrin (EALF)14,15 and camel apolactoferrin (UALF)16 have demonstrated the nature and magnitude of this change. The bilobal nature of lactoferrin raises several questions regarding the functional and structural significance of individual lobes. In view of this, the decoupling of the two molecular halves (N and C-lobes) from the intact protein and studying their iron-binding and iron-release mechanisms, and determining their three-dimensional structures are of critical interest. Conformational differences between lactoferrin molecules bearing one iron atom and those bearing two iron atoms may explain reported variations in the uptake and release of iron. It had been stated that lactoferrin could be broken proteolytically into two molecular halves.17,18 However, a number of studies using proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin have reported only unequal fragments.18 ­ 21 This had reflected a fortuitous nature of cleavage sites within the protein indicating an uncertainty in the production of perfect N and C-lobes. Therefore, attempts were made to clone the N and Clobes separately. The efforts to over-express them succeeded in the case of the N-lobe while it has so far not been successful with the C-lobe. As a result, the crystal structure of a human cloned N-lobe22 and a few of its mutants23 ­ 25 have been determined. In addition, the structure of an 18 kDa N2domain fragment of duck ovotransferrin has also been reported.26 In principle the exposed interlobe peptide 334-344 and an equally exposed Cterminal fragment 674-689 that crosses over from the C-lobe to the N-lobe should have indeed been more susceptible to proteolysis, but the use of specific proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin might not have found the required sites for attacking this small region. Therefore, the use of less specific proteases such as subtilisin and proteinase K could have been more successful. Keeping this in mind, we studied the effects of subtilisin and proteinase K on buffalo lactoferrin and demonstrated that the fungal enzyme proteinase K was able to cleave lactoferrin into two equal parts (N and C-lobes), which were separated and characterized biochemically.27 This indicated the feasibility of determining three-dimensional structures of fully glycosylated native N and C-lobes. Here, we report the crystal structure of a proteolytically generated functional C-lobe of bovine lactoferrin, which has ° been refined using X-ray data to 1.9 A resolution. The proteolytically prepared globular C-lobe of bovine lactoferrin contains three glycosylation sites with fully defined carbohydrates and shows unique features related to a hinge and iron-binding environment. The presence of zinc ions on the surface of the C-lobe indicates a new role of metal ions.

Results and Discussion
Iron-release properties of proteolytically generated C-lobe The purified N and C-lobes correspond to residues 1 ­341 and 342-onwards, respectively. The precise molecular masses of the two lobes as determined with SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF were 38.4 kDa and 38.6 kDa, respectively. The onsets of iron release in the intact lactoferrin and N-lobe occur at pH 6.7 while the release process in the C-lobe starts later at pH 5.6. However, the complete desaturation in the intact lactoferrin occurs at a lower pH value than those observed in N and C-lobes. The early onset of iron-release in N-lobe and intact protein may be attributed to the presence of two lysine residues, Lys210 and Lys301, in the N-lobe that are equivalent to the lysine residues of the so-called "dilysine trigger" of ovotransferrin and serum transferrin.28 Apparently, the dilysine trigger is effective at the initiation stage. Subsequently, inter-lobe interactions may also contribute to the process of iron release. Overall structure The present structure of C-lobe is the first structure of an isolated C-lobe from any lactoferrin. It is also the first structure of a proteolytically generated functional molecular half of lactoferrin. The ° structure has been refined to 1.9 A resolution and is also the highest resolution attained so far for a lactoferrin molecule (Table 1). All the residues were fitted well in the electron density (Figure 1). The high quality electron density indicated the

precise orientations of several side-chains, which resulted in the identification of new interactions that were not observed in the structure of intact bovine lactoferrin.7 For example, Leu451-Lys454 in the present structure forms an ideal type II b-turn conformation with a characteristic i þ 3(Lys454 N) ! i(Leu451 O) hydrogen bond at a distance of ° 2.81 A. In addition to it, the side-chains of Lys452 and Asp453 are oriented favorably to interact electrostatically. It forms yet another hydrogen bond involving Lys454 N1 and Lys452 O. The corresponding loop Leu451-Lys454 in the intact protein adopts a distorted b-turn II conformation. In this case, the characteristic (i þ 3) ! (i) hydrogen bond ° distance was 3.6 A. The side-chains of Lys452, Asp453 and Lys454 were oriented differently and were not involved in similar interactions as observed in the present structure. All the surface loops in the present structure were well defined and hence several new intramolecular interactions, not reported in the intact protein, were observed.

Thus, the overall quality of the structure of the C-lobe is substantially improved over the structure of intact protein. Out of 689 residues in the intact protein, 341 residues consisting of segments Tyr342-Ser676 and Leu681-Ala685 were present in the C-lobe (Figure 2). Final model contains 2593 protein atoms; one Fe3þ, two Zn2þ and one CO22, 3 ten sugar residues and 230 water molecules. The protein molecule has a geometry close to ideal ° with r.m.s. deviations of 0.005 A and 1.38 from the standard values for bond lengths and angles, respectively. A total of 88.7% of the residues were found in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot,29 as defined in the program PROCHECK.30 Only one residue, Leu640, with w, C values of 728, 2 458 was found in the normally disallowed region but it is the central residue in the formation of a b-turn31 that constitutes one wall of the iron-binding cleft in the C-lobe. This b-turn is conserved in the C-lobes of proteins of the transferrin superfamily.32

Structure of Monoferric C-lobe of Bovine Lactoferrin

Molecular structure The overall molecular structure of the C-lobe is similar to that of the C-terminal half of bovine ° diferric lactoferrin with an r.m.s. shift of 0.82 A in the positions of Ca atoms. On incubation with proteinase K, the iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin is cut at four sites, one at Arg341-Tyr342, second at Ser676-Thr677, third at Leu680-Leu681 and fourth at Ala685-Phe686. All the major sites are located at two identical regions, the first a-helix corresponds to the segment 334-344 that crosses over from Nlobe to C-lobe while the second is a C-terminal part consisting of residues 674 ­689 that crosses over from the C-lobe to the N-lobe (Figure 3). As proteinase K is not a very specific enzyme, it cuts lactoferrin apparently at the two structurally most exposed regions of the protein chain. It may be recalled here that in the process of further proteolysis with proteinase K, a decapeptide (402-411) was found liberated from the C-lobe and bound to proteinase K at the active site as an inhibitor.33 Thus, after the first stage of cleavage at the two exposed inter-lobe segments, it could further digest only as many molecules of C-lobe as those of enzyme, because every molecule of C-lobe liberated a decapeptide that inactivated one molecule of proteinase K. For example, if the molar ratio of lactoferrin with respect to proteinase K is 100:1, the digested product with proteinase K will contain 99% fully functional intact molecules of

C-lobe while 1% of the C-lobe would be completely digested. The proteolytically generated C-lobe is approximately the same size as the C-lobe of intact protein. The molecular organization of the C-lobe is shown in Figure 2. The C-lobe in the present structure is divided into two domains, C-1: 342 to 431 þ 593 to 676 þ 681 to 685; and C-2: 432 to 592. It is remarkable to observe that the enzyme proteinase K was selective in cutting the protein at two structurally identical sites with a-helical conformations located at the two inter-lobe crossovers. It was indeed surprising that the rest of the C-lobe was undisturbed by the process of proteolysis. The occurrence of this programmed processing of lactoferrin with proteinase K may not be incidental, although its precise implications are not clearly understood. It may be mentioned here that one of the key distinguishing features between lactoferrin and transferrin is related to the sequences of their inter-lobe peptides as the inter-lobe peptides in the transferrins contain proline-rich and cysteinerich sequences with an extended conformation, while in lactoferrin it does not have such unusual characteristics in the primary sequence and adopts an a-helical conformation. As a result of such remarkable differences in the conformations of connecting peptides, the inter-lobe orientations in these two subclasses of proteins are notably different. Presumably, owing to the proline-rich and cysteine-rich environment and due to extended conformations in transferrin, the digestion of

transferrin with proteinase K, unlike that of lactoferrin, did not produce the two molecular halves (unpublished results). The notable conformational differences between the C-lobe of the intact protein and the present structure were observed in the fragments Arg415° Glu431 (r.m.s. shift of 1.12 A for Ca atoms) and ° Lys650-Glu659 (r.m.s. shift of 1.01 A for Ca atoms). The loop 415-431 is connected to one of the bstrands Tyr433-Lys441 that crosses over from domain C-1 to domain C-2. The loop has highly variable amino acid sequences in various lactoferrins and shows significant conformational differences. The conformation of this loop in BLF is similar to that of CLF while the corresponding loop in HLF adopts a conformation closer to that of ELF. It is noteworthy that the interiors of the loops in BLF and CLF are poorly filled with sidechains, whereas the corresponding loops in HLF and ELF are reasonably well packed. Furthermore, the presence of a Pro residue at position 423 in both HLF and ELF imparts rigidity to the loop. The corresponding residue in BLF and CLF is Leu. Further comparison shows that the loop in HLF has two extra residues and hence the loop is slightly wider in comparison to those in other lactoferrins. As a result of this, to an otherwise tightly packed structure, an element of flexibility is introduced in this loop of HLF. Therefore, as far as the anchoring of the loop is concerned, it is the tightest in ELF followed by that in HLF. The corresponding loops in BLF and CLF are relatively flexible. Therefore, the loop 415-431 in HLF and ELF are expected to firmly hold the b-strand Tyr433-Lys441 at its place and hence it might restrict the movements of domains C-1 and C-2 in these two cases. Two structures of ELF determined from the crystals grown under different conditions had shown that the domains in equine lactoferrin did not move apart even after the removal of ferric ion.14,15 Similarly, the reports indicate that in the case of human apolactoferrin, sometimes the domains in the C-lobe are closed13 while at other times they tend to move apart.34 Although the structures of buffalo and bovine apolactoferrins have not been determined so far, the organizations of loops 415-431 indicate that the possibility of movement of domains in the C-lobes of BLF and CLF exists. The second most variable part in the C-lobe of lactoferrins is the segment Lys650-Glu659. The loop Lys650-Glu659 follows an interesting pattern in which the backbones of HLF and ELF adopt identical conformations while those of BLF and CLF have similar structures. The notable sequence difference in these proteins is at position 652 (654 in HLF). It is Gly in BLF and CLF, whereas in HLF it is His and in ELF it is Gln. The second notable difference is at 655 position (657 in HLF). BLF and CLF have a Pro residue while HLF and ELF have a Thr residue. The third most important difference is at position 659 which contains Glu in BLF and CLF while it is Lys in HLF and Gln in ELF. These variations are apparently responsible for the

observed structural differences in the loop 650-659 of various lactoferrins. In HLF, His654 forms an interaction with a far-away residue Asp429 ° (His654 N12· · ·Asp429 O ¼ 2.65 A). The corresponding Glu652 and His427 provide an equivalent inter° action in ELF (Glu652 N12· · ·His427 O ¼ 3.01 A). These interactions are absent in BLF and CLF. The presence of Pro655 in BLF and CLF provides different constraints than those exerted by the corresponding Thr residue in HLF and ELF. The third aspect concerns with the presence of Glu at 659 in both BLF and CLF, whereas there is Lys in HLF and Gln in ELF. In the present structure one of the two Zn ions is coordinated to Glu659 through both its carboxyl oxygen atoms. As a result of these variations all these structures show notable differences in these regions. Loss of inter-lobe interactions The present structure of the C-lobe of bovine lactoferrin represents the polypeptide chain from 342676 and a cleaved pentapeptide fragment 681-685 hooked to the C-lobe through a disulphide bridge, Cys405-Cys684. It appears that the two protein segments 334-344 and 674-689 that cross over from the N-lobe to the C-lobe and from the C-lobe to the Nlobe, respectively, have been exclusively targeted for initial proteolysis by proteinase K. Generally, these are the two cross-overs that provide strong inter-lobe adhesion in lactoferrins. The covalent connectivity of the former and an inter-digitating linkage of the latter are essentially responsible in bringing several other parts of the two lobes into proximity in the intact molecule. These include ahelices 10, 11 and loop 309-314 of N-lobe and ahelices 2 and 12 of the C-lobe. In addition to these, there are two strong electrostatic interactions involving Asp315 (N-lobe)· · ·Lys386 (C-lobe) and Lys313 (N-lobe)· · ·Asp379 (C-lobe). In the intact molecule, Val382, Leu385, Lys386, Leu680, Ala683, Lys687 and Arg689 of the C-lobe are also involved in hydrophobic interactions with several residues of the N-lobe. In the present case, all these interactions have been lost on the decoupling of N and C-lobes. When the present structure of the C-lobe is superimposed on the structure of the C-lobe of intact bovine lactoferrin the r.m.s. distance between ° Ca positions was found to be 0.82 A. The interface segments of the C-lobe: 342-347, 378-388, 401-408, 598-607 and 662-676 from the present structure were separately superimposed on the corresponding segments of intact lactoferrin, resulting in the ° r.m.s. displacement of 0.91 A for the Ca atoms. Although the r.m.s. shift in the Ca positions of these segments is not significantly higher and the elements of secondary structures were also not perturbed but the side-chain positions of some residues at the interface showed significant variations (r.m.s. shift for all the atoms of interface segments ° < 1.40 A). This indicated a rearrangement of sidechains in the absence of interacting N-lobe sidechains.

Structure of Monoferric C-lobe of Bovine Lactoferrin

Metal and anion-binding sites The metal and anion-binding sites in the present structure are very similar to those observed in the C-lobe of the bovine lactoferrin. The iron ligands Asp395, Tyr433, Tyr526, His595 and the CO3 ion are well ordered and are coordinated to Fe3þ in the form of an ideal octahedral geometry (Figure 4(a)). The iron ­ligand bond lengths are in the ° range of 1.85­ 2.29 A (Table 2A). The overall ironbinding geometry in the present structure has slightly longer distances than those observed in the intact bovine lactoferrin.7 The carbonate ion occupies a positively charged pocket in the wall of domain C2 (Figure 4(b)). This pocket is formed by the N terminus of helix a 5 and the side-chains of Arg463 and Thr459. This resulted in the formation of a set of hydrogen bonds that satisfied the full hydrogen bonding potential of the carbonate ion, and allowed it to fit perfectly between the iron atom and the anion binding pocket. The metal ­ ligand bonds and the hydrogen bonds involving the anion are listed in Table 2B. The metal ­ ligand distances in the present structure are only slightly longer than those observed in the C-lobe of the bovine lactoferrin, whereas all the hydrogen bond distances involving carbonate oxygen atoms are significantly shorter, indicating a better integration of the carbonate ion with the protein structure.

Inter-domain interactions The processes of iron-binding and iron-release in lactoferrins show a large scale movement in some of the members of the lactoferrin family12,13 and almost negligible movement in others.14,15 It probably means that the inter-domain interactions in various lactoferrins from different species may not be identical and hence might influence the opening and closing of the lobes differently. Two hydrogen bonds involving Asp395 of domain C-1 and Thr464 of domain C-2 belong to the iron-binding site. In addition to this, there are four more hydrogen bonds that involve four residues from each domain. The inter-domain interactions involving Glu353 O11 and Ser519 Og (C-2) and Asn644 Nd2 (C-1) and Glu550 O11 (C-2) were not indicated in the structure of intact bovine lactoferrin. It may also be noted that Lys637 interacts with Glu353 along the inner wall of the C-1 domain. This interaction was not observed in the intact molecule. The strongest feature of the inter-domain cleft is the large number of solvent molecules of which 24 have been identified in the present structure. The majority of these occupy the large inter-domain cavity that stretches between the iron-site and the mouth of the cleft. A large number of interactions between the domains are also mediated by the solvent. These are 11 single water bridges between protein groups on the two domains while there are many more bridges involving multiple water molecules. Carbohydrate structure The amino acid sequence of C-lobe indicates three possible sites of glycosylation. The structure determination of the C-lobe shows excellent electron density at all the three sites involving Asn368, Asn476 and Asn545. The interpretation of the electron density at Asn368 clearly suggests the presence of an N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), two units of N-acetylglucosamine and one unit of a1,4-mannose (MAN) at Asn476 and two units of N-acetylglucosamine and four units of a-1,4-mannose at Asn545 (Figure 5(a)). As seen from Figure

A total of ten units were accounted for at three sites with one NAG at 368, two NAG and one MAN at Asn476 and two NAG and four MAN at Asn545. (b) Schematic representation of the C-lobe. Three carbohydrate moieties attached to Asn368, Asn476 and Asn545 are shown in ball and stick presentation. The iron metal ion is shown in red while zinc ions are indicated in gray.

5(b), Asn545 is located in a fairly deep cleft between the back end of the C-1 and C-2 domains, near the hinge region of the C-lobe. It is noteworthy that the inner core of this glycan chain is sandwiched between the two domains. On the other hand, Asn368 is on the surface of the C-1 domain on the turn between helix a 1 and strand bb and the single NAG residue at this site is oriented by a hydrogen bond between the acetyl oxygen O7 and the side-chain amide of Gln614. The third glycosylation site involving Asn476 is at the C terminus of helix 5 on the C-2 domain. In contrast to the other sites, this does not have any interaction with the protein molecule. In spite of this, the Asn-NAG-NAG-MAN core structures at both the Asn476 and Asn545 attachment sites have remarkably similar conformations. As observed in Asn-linked carbohydrate structures, the conformation of the Asn-NAG-NAG-MAN unit is relatively rigid.35,36 The presence of several hydrogen bonds between the carbohydrate units

and with the protein molecule to which they are covalently linked as well as with water molecules have stabilized the carbohydrate structure in the present case. The overall structures of carbohydrate moieties in the isolated C-lobe are similar to those observed in the intact bovine lactoferrin.7 Crystal packing The solvent content in the crystals of the C-lobe is 51%, which is lower than the value found in the crystals of intact bovine lactoferrin (55%). It means that the molecules of the C-lobe are packed more tightly in the crystal structure than those of intact bovine lactoferrin (Figure 6). There are at least 20 inter-molecular hydrogen bonds in the crystal structure of the C-lobe. These involve residues Tyr342, Arg344, Asp379, Leu385, Lys386, Asp390, Gly406, Glu444, Asp496, Glu510, Lys514, Asn563, Glu659 and Leu681. In addition to inter-molecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions

there are two zinc atoms at the surface of the molecule and provide four sites of strong inter-molecular interactions through sixfold metal coordinations (Table 3). The first site involves two protein ligands His588 and the symmetry-related Glu444 (Table 3). The remaining coordinations are provided by water molecules W132, W196 and W197. The second site is coordinated through Lys386, Glu659 and symmetry-related Glu388 (Table 3). In this case, one water molecule W194 is involved in the coordination. In spite of such strong crystal contacts and completely different inter-molecular interactions the orientations of the domains in the C-lobe were found to be identical to that of the C-lobe of bovine lactoferrin.

also explain the low value of thermal factors and good resolution of diffraction data. So far crystals with divalent metal ions other than zinc have not been obtained.

Conclusions
This is the highest resolution structure reported so far for any lactoferrin molecule. These studies have demonstrated that the perfect functional N and C-lobes of lactoferrin can be generated proteolytically. It may be noted that the glycan content in the C-lobe of bovine lactoferrin is higher than that reported in other lactoferrins and yet the whole of it was well defined in the excellent observed electron density. It is remarkable that proteinase K cuts the lactoferrin molecule only at the inter-lobe region. The first site is located at the connecting segment 334344 and other three sites are found at the C-terminal helix that crosses over from the C-lobe to the N-lobe. The biological implications of this selectivity in hydrolysis of lactoferrin is not clearly understood. It is also noteworthy that the decoupling of the C-lobe from the N-lobe does not induce significant conformational changes even in the interface regions of the two lobes. The close identity of the metal and anion-binding sites with bovine lactoferrin indicates that these binding sites are optimized for the binding of Fe3þ and CO22 and their geo3 metrical arrangements are highly stable.

decreasing pH in the intact protein, N-lobe and Clobe may be attributed to the observed differences in the inter-domain interactions and the loss of inter-lobe forces in the N and C-lobes. Since the metal and anion-binding sites appear essentially identical, the effects must derive from factors outside the immediate-binding sites. This is the first structure of any lactoferrin or a part of lactoferrin where metal ions have been found at sites other than the iron-binding site. Two zinc atoms were observed at sites involving His588 and Glu659. These metal ions formed sixfold stable coordination structures with the symmetry-related molecules. It is notable that bovine lactoferrin is one of the most glycosylated proteins of the transferrin superfamily. Between its N and C-lobes, the C-lobe is more heavily glycosylated than the N-lobe. All the three glycan chains in the C-lobe were clearly defined in the observed electron densities of the crystal structure of C-lobe. The carbohydrate moiety linked to Asn545 is located between the two domains near the back of the iron-binding site and is deeply embedded into the protein molecule giving rise to several interactions between the protein and carbohydrate molecules.

Crystallization of the C-lobe Crystal screens I and II (Hampton Research, USA) were used to search for initial crystallization conditions for the C-lobe of bovine lactoferrin. A 50 mg/ml protein solution in deionized water was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the crystallization buffer (0.1 M Mes (pH 6.5) containing 25% (v/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550 M and 0.01 M zinc sulphate heptahydrate) and allowed it to equilibrate via vapor diffusion over 1000 ml of well solution at 25 8C. The irregular shaped dark brown colored crystals appeared in 12 hours and grew to a final size of 0.6 mm £ 0.4 mm £ 0.3 mm.

Data collection The X-ray intensity data were collected at 283 K on a MAR 345 dtb imaging plate detector using Cu Ka radiation from a Rigaku RU-300 rotating-anode generator. ° The data, extended to approximately 1.9 A resolution were processed using DENZO40 and scaled and merged using program SCALEPACK.40 The observed diffraction pattern corresponded to space group P21 with unit cell ° ° ° dimensions a ¼ 63.4 A, b ¼ 50.5 A, c ¼ 65.9 A, b ¼ 107.78. The crystallographic data statistics are summarized in Table 4.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of N and C-lobes Lactoferrin was isolated from bovine colostrum and purified using the procedure reported.37 It was saturated with iron and hydrolyzed with proteinase K as described.27 The N and C-lobes of lactoferrin were separated from the digests on a column (150 mm £ 15 mm) of CM-Sephadex C-50 using a salt gradient of 0.0­ 0.5 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0). The separated peaks of the N and C-lobes were further purified independently on a gel filtration column (100 mm £ 15 mm) of Sephadex G-75 in 50 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 8.0). The Nterminal sequences of both N and C-lobes were determined using a Shimadzu PPSQ-21A protein sequencer (Shimadzu, Japan). The molecular masses of the N and C-lobes were estimated using sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The molecular mass of the C-lobe was also determined using Matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionization-timeof-flight (MALDI-TOF) (KRATOS, Shimadzu, Japan). Analysis of iron-release from intact bovine lactoferrin (CLF), its N-lobe and C-lobe The iron was removed in a step-wise manner. The purified iron-saturated solutions of native lactoferrin, N-lobe and C-lobe were prepared at 1% concentrations in 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0) and were dialyzed against an excess of 0.1 M citric acid with regular changes of dialyzing buffer with a fresh buffer after every six hours. The dialysis experiments were carried out at different values of pH for 24 hours starting from pH 8.0 to 2.0 at pH intervals of 0.5. At every pH value, iron saturation was estimated from the ratio of A465/A280. The ratio of absorbance A465/A280 was used to evaluate the degree of iron saturation in CLF, the N-lobe and the C-lobe.38,39

Structure determination The structure was determined by molecular replacement method with the program AMoRe (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994)41 using the coordinates of the C-terminal half from the structure of bovine diferric lactoferrin as a search model.7 The top most solution in the rotation function had a correlation coefficient of 59.4%, whereas the next highest peak was below 26%. A translational position was found which yielded an R factor of 44% and correlation coefficient of 78.7%. The stacking arrangement of the molecules in the unit cell for this solution yielded no unfavorable intermolecular contacts.

Structure of Monoferric C-lobe of Bovine Lactoferrin

Model building and refinement Positional and temperature-factor refinement were carried out using REFMAC (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994)41 against all measured ° reflections to 1.9 A resolution. The refinement calculation was interleaved with several rounds of model building with the program O.42 In the process of chain tracing the starting amino acid in the C-lobe was found to be Tyr342, which matched with the experimentally determined N-terminal sequence of the purified C-lobe. On the C-terminal end, the electron density was not observed beyond Ser676 indicating the loss of C-terminal fragment 677-689. An additional electron density corresponding to a C-terminal pentapeptide 681-685 was observed, which also showed a continuous electron density between Cys405 and Cys684 side-chains. The high quality electron density of the C-lobe indicated two changes from earlier determined structures of CLF.7 These were from Asn565 to Lys565 as in BLF and Lys608 to Glu608 as in ELF and HLF. The electron density for Fe3þ(Figure 4(a)) and CO22 (Figure 4(b)) and 3 the iron-binding protein ligands were clearly observed. In addition to these observations, the well defined electron densities at 6s cutoff were visible at two sites

on the surface of the protein into which two Zn2þwere placed (Figure 7). It may be mentioned here that ZnCl2 was part of the crystallization buffer. The good quality of crystals of the C-lobe could be attributed to the presence of Zn ions. The difference electron density l2Fo 2 Fc l map also indicated the presence of three carbohydrate chains linked to Asn368, Asn476 and Asn545 containing a total of ten monosaccharide units (Figure 5(a)). All these were included in the further refinement steps. The oligosaccharide chains were refined using bond length and bond angle parameters from idealized N-acetylglucosamine and mannose units and glycosidic linkages.43 Water molecules were added using the program ARP (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994).41 Several further rounds of refinement using REFMAC interspersed with model building into l2Fo 2 Fc l and lFo 2 Fc l maps eventually reduced the R-factor and free R-factor to 0.193 and 0.221, respectively. The positions of 245 water molecules were determined but included in the model, provided that they met the criteria of peaks greater than 3s in lFo 2 Fc l map, hydrogen bond partners with appropriate distance and angle geometry and B values less than ° 75 A2 when refined. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
