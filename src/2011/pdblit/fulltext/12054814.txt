Some of them are related to molecular recognition; the modified nucleosides found in the tRNA anticodon contribute to the high fidelity of codon recognition (Bjork et al., 1999; Giege et al., 1998; Marck and ´ ¨ Grosjean, 2002; Yokoyama and Nishimura, 1995). Another important function of the modified nucleosides is in the structural formation and stabilization of the functional RNAs (Charette and Gray, 2000; Horie et al., 1985; Kawai et al., 1992; reviewed in Davis, 1998). Many human diseases related to the structural formation of RNA emphasize the importance of the RNA modifications. In several mitochondrial diseases, mutations in tRNA genes reduce the modification level and the structural stability of the mitochondrial tRNAs, and thus may slow down the translation (Helm et al., 1999). On the other hand, there are several diseases related to deficiencies of RNA-modification enzymes, such as dyskeratosis congenita (DC). DC is an X-linked disorder characterized by premature aging and increased tumor susceptibility (Heiss et al., 1998). Patients with DC have a mutation in the gene encoding dyskerin/Cbf5p, a component of the box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is responsible for the pseudouridylation of snRNAs and rRNAs (Heiss et al., 1998; Lafontaine et al., 1998). The importance of the modified nucleosides has also been investigated in bacterial systems. For example, a ribosome with an unmodified rRNA component has lower peptidyl-transfer activity as compared to that with the fully-modified rRNA (Green and Noller, 1999; Khaitovich et al., 1999). In E. coli, the deletion of the pseudouridine ( ) synthase for tRNA (TruB) or rRNA (RluD) resulted in impaired growth (Gutgsell et al., 2000; Ofengand, 2002). In addition, the RNA modification enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these modified nucleosides may not only modify the nucleosides but also function as RNA chaperones, assisting in the correct folding of their substrate RNAs (Gutgsell et al., 2001; Ofengand, 2002). The modified nucleosides involved in structural folding and stabilization usually form long-range, or tertiary, interactions. Typically, tRNA contains complex tertiary interactions (Kim et al., 1973). Most tertiary interactions of tRNA are centralized in its "core," which consists of the D arm and the variable loop (Figure 1A). The tRNA core contains many different modifications, such as s4U8, m1G9, m2G10, 13, m1A22, m22G26, m7G46, and m5C48. Moreover, the "L-shape" of the tRNA is established by the interaction between the D and T loops (Figure 1A). Several modifications (e.g., Gm18 and 55) are involved in this tertiary interaction, which anchors the acceptor side to the anticodon side (Bjork, 1995; ¨ Limbach et al., 1994; Marck and Grosjean, 2002; McCloskey and Crain, 1998; Sprinzl et al., 1998). The crystal structure of a complex of the tRNA 55 synthase, TruB, and a T stem-loop RNA revealed that TruB gains access to U55 by a base-flipping mechanism (Hoang and Ferre´ ´ D'Amare, 2001). By contrast, the modification sites in the tRNA core are buried more deeply and are involved in the complicated tertiary interactions described above.

Summary Transfer RNA (tRNA) canonically has the clover-leaf secondary structure with the acceptor, D, anticodon, and T arms, which are folded into the L-shaped tertiary structure. To strengthen the L form, posttranscriptional modifications occur on nucleotides buried within the core, but the modification enzymes are paradoxically inaccessible to them in the L form. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of tRNA bound with archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase, which modifies G15 of the D arm in the core. The bound tRNA assumes an alternative conformation (" form") drastically different from the L form. All of the D-arm secondary base pairs and the canonical tertiary interactions are disrupted. Furthermore, a helical structure is reorganized, while the rest of the D arm is single stranded and protruded. Consequently, the enzyme precisely locates the exposed G15 in the active site, by counting the nucleotide number from G1 to G15 in the form. Introduction RNA molecules involved in translation and posttranscriptional RNA processing, such as tRNA, rRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), contain many modified nucleosides (Limbach et al., 1994; McCloskey and Crain,

A tRNA Modification Enzyme, ArcTGT, Replaces the Base at Position 15 in the D Loop, which Is Deeply Buried in the Canonical L Form of tRNA (A) The secondary and tertiary structures of tRNA in the canonical L form. The acceptor, D, anticodon, and T arms, and the variable loop are colored red, yellow, green, purple, and sky blue, respectively. The secondary structure is shown in the clover-leaf (left) and L-shape (center) diagrams. The RNA backbones are shown with thick lines, while the Watson-Crick base pairs are indicated with short thin lines. In the tertiary structure (right), the RNA backbone is shown as a tube model and the Watson-Crick base pairs are shown with sticks. The ArcTGT target site, G15, which is buried deeply in the tRNA tertiary structure, is circled. (B) Biosynthetic pathway of archaeosine. The guanine moiety of G15 is replaced with preQ0 by the transglycosylation catalyzed by ArcTGT. Afterwards, the preQ0 at position 15 is further modified to archaeosine on the polynucleotide chain, by an unknown pathway (Watanabe et al., 1997). The biosynthetic pathway of preQ0 is also unknown.

Hence, a more profound change in the tRNA conformation is necessary for the modification enzymes that target the tRNA core. Archaeosine, 7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine (Figure 1B), is a modified nucleoside widely found in archaea (Edmonds et al., 1991; Gregson et al., 1993; McCloskey et al., 2001). Archaeosine is present at position 15 in the tRNA D loop and is found within many tRNA isoacceptors (Gupta, 1984; Sprinzl et al., 1998). The nucleoside at position 15 interacts with position 48 in the variable loop and position 59 in the T loop. Thus, archaeosine is involved not only in the tRNA core formation, but also in the interaction between the D and T loops, which establishes the L-shape of the tRNA. Archaeosine therefore plays a crucial role as a wedge that strengthens the interactions among the variable, D, and T loops, which may tighten the tRNA structure. Archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (ArcTGT) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of archaeosine (Figure 1B). ArcTGT replaces the guanine base at position 15 of tRNAs with the free precursor, 7-cyano-7deazaguanine (preQ0), by cleaving and regenerating the N-glycosidic bond (Bai et al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 1997). To replace the base at the deeply buried position

15 (Figure 1A), ArcTGT must bind to a different tRNA structure, in which G15 may be exposed to the enzyme active site. Moreover, previous biochemical and structural studies of ArcTGT suggested that it precisely locates position 15 of the tRNA and specifically binds it to the catalytic center (Ishitani et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 2000). However, ArcTGT has no sequence specificity to the other parts of the tRNA besides G15. Therefore, it is not understood how ArcTGT accurately locates position 15 of the tRNA without any primary structural information. The C-terminal domains of the ArcTGTs contain a ubiquitously found RNA binding domain, the PUA (the pseudouridine synthase and archaeosine TGT) domain (Aravind and Koonin, 1999). The PUA domain of ArcTGT has high sequence homology to those of Cbf5p/dyskerin, which are responsible for the pseudouridylation of snRNAs and rRNAs, as noted above. Therefore, the PUA domains of Cbf5p/dyskerin and ArcTGT presumably share a common role as an RNA recognition domain. Moreover, the crystal structure of the ligand-free ArcTGT suggested that the large positively charged patch on the molecular surface of the C-terminal domains, including the PUA domain, of ArcTGT may recog-

structural difference either between the A and B subunits of the protein or between the two tRNA molecules, I and II, bound to the protein. As the tRNA-I molecule bears lower B factors than the tRNA-II molecule, we hereafter describe the complex structure focusing on the tRNA-I molecule, unless otherwise stated. The crystal structure of the ArcTGT·tRNAVal complex features the following points. First, the structure of the tRNA in the complex (here named the " form") is strikingly different from the canonical L-shaped tRNA structure (Figures 3A and 3B). In the form, the nucleotide residues U8 through U22 of the D arm protrude, while the rest of the D stem and the variable loop form a new helical structure (Figures 3A and 3B). We propose the possibility that the form is also assumed by tRNAs in other systems. Second, the C-terminal domains of the A subunit recognize the tRNA acceptor stem (Figures 2A and 5C). Third, the catalytic domain of the B subunit binds the protruded part (U8­U17) of the D arm (Figures 2C). In this order, the details of the complex structure are described below. Novel Tertiary Structure of tRNA In the form, the nucleotide residues U8­U22 of the D arm protrude from the body of the tRNA (Figure 3A). This drastic change results from the complete reorganization of the "core" of the L-shaped structure. In the canonical form (designated hereafter as the "L form"), the D stem is formed by the base pairing of G10, U11, C12, and U13 with C25, A24, G23, and U22, respectively (Figures 1A and 3B). Furthermore, the D arm and the variable loop are tightly connected by the tertiary base pairs and triples (long-range two-base and three-base interactions, respectively), G10:C25:G45, G9:C12:G23, U13:U22:G46, U8:A14, G15:C48 (Figure 1A and 4B), which form the "core" of the canonical L shape. In the -form tRNA, all of the base-base interactions for the formation of the D stem and the canonical core are completely disrupted. Thus, the entire region from U8 to U22 is not base paired in the form (Figures 2D and 3A). On the other hand, G23-A24-C25 forms Watson-Crick base pairs with G46-U47-C48 in the variable loop (Figures 2D and 3A), and the top base pair (G23:C48) stacks with the A59 nucleotide residue in the T loop (Figure 4A). This long-range interaction is reminiscent of the A59 and C48:G15 interactions in the canonical core (Figure 4B). Next to this "stem," there is the "internal loop" consisting of G26, A44, and G45 (Figure 4A). This reorganization in the D-arm and variable-loop regions forms a new base-stacked double-helical structure, which is designated hereafter as the "DV helix." Thus, in the -form tRNA, the "DV helix" has replaced the canonical core. The secondary structures of all tRNAs from P. horikoshii and E. coli, except for those with a long variable arm (type-II tRNA), can be reorganized to form a similar "DV helix" (Supplemental Figure S2 available at http:// www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/113/3/383/DC1). These DV helices are characterized by the presence of non-Watson-Crick base pairs, and should be much less rigid than the canonical core. Actually, we prepared an unnatural tRNA variant with a DV helix rich in purinepurine mismatches, and found that its transglycosylation activity was as high as 24% of that of the normal

nize the backbone phosphates of tRNA (Ishitani et al., 2002). Recently, it was pointed out that the C-terminal, RNA binding domain of the E. coli 55 synthase, TruB, superimposes well on the PUA domain of ArcTGT, although there is no sequence homology between the two domains (Ferre-D'Amare, 2003). However, the actual ´ ´ roles of the eukaryotic and archaeal PUA domains remain elusive. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of the Pyrococcus horikoshii ArcTGT complexed ° with tRNAVal at 3.3 A resolution. This is, to our knowledge, the first structure determination of a tRNA modification enzyme bound to a full-length tRNA. We revealed that the tRNA modification enzyme binds a surprisingly different tRNA conformation (" form"), in which the canonical core is completely disrupted and the melted D arm is protruded. Moreover, the PUA domain was found to be crucial for the precise location of the tRNA molecule on the enzyme. Results and Discussion Overall Structure The crystal structure of the ArcTGT·tRNAVal complex was solved by molecular replacement, using the tRNA-free ArcTGT structure (Ishitani et al., 2002) as a search model (Table 1; Supplemental Figure S1 available at http:// www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/113/3/383/DC1). The asymmetric unit of the ArcTGT·tRNAVal crystal contains one ArcTGT dimer (subunits A and B; Figure 2A) and two tRNAVal molecules (tRNAs I and II; Figure 2A). As expected from the tRNA-free ArcTGT structure (Ishitani et al., 2002), each tRNA is bound with both of the two subunits of ArcTGT (Figure 2A). The backbone structures of the tRNA-bound and tRNA-free ArcTGTs are mostly the same, but several residues near the catalytic site exhibit different conformations. The dimerization manner of ArcTGT in the tRNA-bound form is also the same as that in the free form. There is no considerable

tRNA (data not shown). Therefore, the continuous Watson-Crick base pairs in the DV helix are not important for the tRNA to assume the form. The DV helix and the anticodon stem are connected to form a doublehelical structure, with the axis kinked by about 30 degrees at the internal loop (Figures 3A and 4A). The top base pair of the anticodon stem (C27:G43) is distorted

and is therefore non-hydrogen-bonded, which may be ascribed to the internal loop (Figure 4A). The DV helix and the anticodon stem are entirely docked in the cleft between the catalytic domain and the C-terminal domains (Figure 2B). Specifically, the DV helix seems to be stabilized by the tRNA-protein interactions described below.

The nucleotide backbones are represented by ribbon models. The acceptor-, T-, D-, anticodon-arms, and variable-loop regions are colored red, purple, yellow, green, and blue, respectively. The DV helix is indicated with dashed lines. (B) Stereo view of the core structure of the canonical L-form tRNA (yeast tRNAPhe; Shi and Moore, 2000). The coloring schemes are the same as in (A). The canonical core structure is indicated with a dashed rectangle.

In contrast, the conformation of the T loop is roughly the same as that of the canonical tRNA, despite the absence of the canonical tertiary interactions with the invariant G18G19 in the D loop. The structures of the T and acceptor arms in the form are almost the same as those of the L form (Figures 3A and 3B). Mitochondrial tRNA in the Form Intriguingly, tRNA secondary structures similar to that of the form are found in mitochondria (mt) (Okimoto and Wolstenholme, 1990; Wolstenholme et al., 1987). For example, Xenopus laevis mt tRNAAsnGUU (Roe et al., 1985) cannot form the canonical D-stem base pairs, although it has a D arm with nearly the same length as that of the normal tRNA (Figure 3C). The mt tRNAAsn can form the DV helix, and the secondary structure is like that of the form (Figure 3C). Furthermore, Ascaris suum mt tRNASerUCU (Okimoto et al., 1992) lacks most of the D arm (Figure 3D). The structural analysis of A. suum mt tRNASer in solution suggested that its variable loop and shortened D arm form a flexible stem ("connector region") that stacks on the anticodon stem (Figure 3D; Ohtsuki et al., 2002). The bottom uridines of the connector region are base paired, while other uridines form a base-stacked stem-like structure (Figure 3D). The connector region of the mt tRNASer also resembles the DV helix of the -form tRNA (Figure 3D).

Roles of the DV Helix The canonical L form has the tight core structure made by the D-arm and the variable loop. In contrast, the same tRNA regions assume the un-base-paired loop and the soft DV helix conformations in the form. The former is for the access of G15 to ArcTGT, and the un-basepaired region is protected by the protein (see below). As for the DV helix, one possible role is to protect the regions from degradation or aggregation, as the same regions are protected by the canonical core formation in the L form. The DV helix may also prevent the propagation of the base pair disruption to the anticodon and T stems of the tRNA. On the other hand, after the modification, the tRNA should refold to the canonical L form, because the -form tRNA may not function in aminoacylation and translation, and may be prone to degradation or aggregation. Therefore, the non-rigid nature of the DV helix, described above, is probably suitable for the efficient refolding to the canonical L form. Possible Involvement of the -Form tRNA in Other Modification Processes The present study of the ArcTGT·tRNA complex revealed that the modification enzyme targeting the tRNA core binds the -form tRNA. In addition to archaeosine, which is unique to archaea, several modifications, such as s4U8, m1G9, m2G10, 13, and m1A22, within the tRNA

Restructured tRNA Bound to a Modification Enzyme 389

core are found in one or more of the three phylogenic domains (Sprinzl et al., 1998). Therefore, it is possible that the modification enzymes for those modified nucleosides also recognize the protruded D arm of the -form tRNA. Similarly, the T loop in the -form tRNA is accessible to enzymes, because the canonical interactions between the D and T loops (G18:U55 and G19:C56) are disrupted (Figure 3A). Actually, the tRNA 55 synthase, TruB, can access U55 more easily in the form than in the L form, according to the crystal structure of the T stem-loop RNA·TruB complex (Hoang and Ferre-D'Amare, ´ ´ 2001). Moreover, TruB recognizes the acceptor stem from the opposite side to the ArcTGT. Thus, both enzymes can bind with the -form tRNA simultaneously (Figure 3E). The conformational transition between the L and forms might be a rate-limiting step for each modification enzyme. However, once the tRNA conformation has changed to the form, the modification enzymes may successively bind it and modify their target sites one after another, as in this docking model (Figure 3E). Therefore, it is feasible that the tRNA modification enzymes, as well as the processing enzymes, are localized in the cell and form a weak complex, which may be something like a factory for tRNA maturation ("modificosome"). ArcTGT C-Terminal Domains Recognize the tRNA Acceptor Stem In contrast to the DV helix and anticodon arm, the acceptor stem is tightly recognized by the C-terminal domains of ArcTGT (Figure 2D). The basic residues, Arg573, Lys576, and Arg578, on the sheet of domain C3 electrostatically interact with the backbone phosphates of G69 to C72 (Figures 2D and 5A). The pattern of the positively-charged patch on the surface of domain C3 (Figure 5B) is complementary to the negativelycharged phosphates of the 3 strand of the acceptor stem. Domain C3 is the PUA domain (Aravind and Koonin, 1999), which is widely found throughout the RNA modification enzymes from eukaryotes and archaea. Specifically, the basic residues involved in the RNA recognition described above (Lys576 and Arg578) are conserved among the PUA domains of Cbf5p (Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure S3 available at URL above), which is a catalytic component of the box H/ACA snoRNP and is responsible for the formation in rRNAs and snRNAs (Lafontaine et al., 1998; Watkins et al., 1998). Ferre-D'Amare (2003) found that the structure of ´ ´ an RNA binding domain of the E. coli TruB (Hoang and Ferre-D'Amare, 2001) superimposes well on that of the ´ ´ PUA domain of ArcTGT (Ishitani et al., 2002), although no sequence homology between the two enzymes is detectable. The present complex structure revealed that the RNA binding modes of the TruB and ArcTGT domains are different (Figure 5D). Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that Arg307 in TruB may have a similar role to that of Arg578 in ArcTGT. The main chain of the residues (Lys522, Gly523, and Lys524) in domain C3 recognizes the 5 end of the acceptor stem (Figures 5B and 5C). Thus, the molecular surface of domain C3 snugly fits on the terminus of the acceptor stem (Figures 5B and 5C). If there were one more base pair on the top, it would cause a serious

steric hindrance with domain C3. On the other hand, the CCA-terminal residues of the tRNA are stacked with the Phe residues (C75 and Phe527, and A76 and Phe519, respectively) in domain C3 (Figure 5A), which are highly conserved in ArcTGT (Supplemental Figure S3). A previous biochemical analysis suggested that the CCA-terminal residues are not required for the recognition by ArcTGT (Watanabe et al., 2000), which is feasible since premature tRNAs often lack these residues (Aebi et al., 1990). Therefore, the interactions may simply anchor the CCA-terminal residues to the side of domain C3 for protection from degradation. The polar residues, Arg483, Arg478, Gln471, Thr481, and Thr490, on the sheet in domain C2 interact with the backbone phosphates of C66 to G69 (Figure 2D). The surface of domain C2 also forms a positively charged patch, which snugly fits the phosphates of the 3 strand of the acceptor stem and is continuous with that of domain C3 (Figure 5B). Therefore, domains C2 and C3 collaborate to locate all of the acceptor-stem base pairs (1:72 to 7:66) accurately. A Hairpin in Domain C2 Stabilizes the Form tRNA The tip of the 18 19 hairpin (Lys465 to Thr466), which protrudes from the flat RNA binding surface formed by domains C2 and C3, is thrust into the underarm of the L-shaped portion of the -form tRNA (Figure 5B). The main chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr466 hydrogen bonds with the 2 -hydroxyl group of C25 (Figure 2D). The side chain of Lys465 is flanked by the phosphates of U8 and C49, with which it electrostatically interacts (Figure 2D). In the -form tRNA, C25 and C48 are involved in the DV helix. U8 and its subsequent nucleotides (G9 to U17) are un-base-paired and bound to ArcTGT. On the other hand, if we dock the canonical L-form tRNA to ArcTGT so that the acceptor and T stems are superimposed on those of the -form tRNA, then the 18 19 hairpin causes a steric clash against U8, C25, and C48. Therefore, the 18 19 hairpin may be important for the -form tRNA recognition. We constructed a deletion mutant lacking residues 463 to 466 ( (463­466)), and assayed the transglycosylation activity. We could not detect any activity with this deletion mutant (data not shown), which also suggests that the 18 19 hairpin plays a crucial role in the recognition of the -form tRNA. ArcTGT Counts the Nucleotide Number between Positions 1 and 15 As already described above, the entire stem-loop structure of the D arm is completely disrupted, and nucleotide residues U8 to U22 are stretched out from the tRNA body. The first part of the stretched residues (U8 to U13) is bound to the cleft, formed by the two subunits of ArcTGT (Figure 6A). The phosphate backbone of these nucleotide residues is recognized by the hydrophilic residues of ArcTGT (Figures 2D and 6A). On the other hand, the base moieties of these nucleotide residues are stacked with each other and are not recognized by ArcTGT, except for G9 and G10 (Figures 2D and 6A). The 2-amino groups of G9 and G10 hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl group of Ala418 and the side chain of Glu421, respectively. The A14, G15, and U16 nucleotides are bound to the catalytic domain of ArcTGT

(Figures 2D and 6B). The A14 and U16 nucleotide residues are bound to the pockets formed at the edge of the ( / )8 barrel, whereas the G15 nucleotide residue is buried deeply within its center. Both the A14 and U16 pockets are mainly composed of hydrophobic residues and are large enough to accommodate purine bases, which suggests that these pockets do not provide basespecific recognition. On the other hand, the base moiety of G15, which is the target site for the base-exchange reaction, is specifically recognized in a similar manner to that seen in the ArcTGT·guanine complex structure (Ishitani et al., 2002). Previous biochemical results suggested that ArcTGT specifically recognizes G15 without any primary structural information of the tRNA (Watanabe et al., 2000). Mutants at positions 8 to 14 retained the same guanineexchanging activity as the intact tRNA, whereas mutants at position 15 abolished the activity. Moreover, insertion or deletion mutants at positions 8 to 14 considerably reduced the activity. This tRNA recognition mechanism can be clearly explained by the present complex structure. First, the tight recognition of the tRNA acceptor stem by domains C2 and C3, including the 18 19 hairpin, enables ArcTGT to count the number of the acceptor

stem pairs (from 1:72 to 7:66; Figure 2D). Next, ArcTGT precisely counts bases within the un-base-paired D arm from positions 8 to 13 by recognizing their backbone phosphates and sugars one by one (Figure 2D). Finally, the nucleotide residues at positions 14, 15, and 16 are correctly bound to the pockets on the catalytic domain (Figure 2D), as described above. Concluding Remarks The present crystal structure revealed that a tRNA modification enzyme modifies its buried target site by recognizing a tRNA with a profound conformational change, in which the tRNA is not denatured but in an alternative conformation, the form. The form of tRNA provides a scaffold for modification enzyme binding. In addition, the -form formation may protect the unrecognized parts of the tRNA from enzymatic and/or chemical degradation. Hence, the -form formation may be indispensable for the modification. This mechanism of structurally-reorganized RNA recognition may also be found in other RNA modification systems. For example, eukaryotic snRNAs and rRNAs are modified in the nucleolus by base pairing with sno-

Cell 392

RNAs, which have complementary sequences to the modification target sites and serve as guides for the modification (reviewed in Kiss, 2001, 2002). The base pairing between rRNA/snRNA and snoRNA may be a remarkable example of the structural reorganization taking place in RNA modification. In the RNA modification by the snoRNP complex noted above, its catalytic protein component modifies the RNA target site by recognizing the rRNA/snRNAsnoRNA duplex and the conserved sequence in the snoRNA. The distance from the conserved sequence to the target site is important for the target-site determination (Kiss, 2001, 2002). Among the snoRNP components, Cbf5p, which is responsible for the formation in rRNAs and snRNAs, contains the PUA domain. Therefore, we speculate that the PUA domains of ArcTGT and Cbf5p share a common role in the "position-specific" RNA recognition. The position-specific tRNA recognition revealed in the present study provides a structural basis for understanding such RNA recognition in the nucleolus.
Experimental Procedures Crystallization and Data Collection Overproduction and purification of the P. horikoshii ArcTGT were performed using a method similar to that described elsewhere (Ishitani et al., 2001). The P. horikoshii tRNAVal isoacceptor with the UAC anticodon was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase. Crystals were grown at 20 C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The protein/tRNA solution for crystallization was prepared at a final protein concentration of 6­8 mg ml 1, for a molar ratio of ArcTGT and tRNA of 1:1. A 1 l aliquot of the protein/tRNA solution was mixed with 1 l of a crystallization solution, composed of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 5.6) containing 1.0 M ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and 0.3% xylitol. The drop solution was slowly equilibrated against a reservoir solution, composed of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 5.6) containing 1.0 M ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and 400 mM sodium chloride. Crystals grew to dimensions of 100 100 100 m in the course of 2 months. For data collection under cryogenic conditions, the crystals were briefly transferred to a solution of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 5.6) containing 1.2 M ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and 25% (v/v) glycerol, and were flash-cooled by a cryo-stream of helium gas at 100 K. The dataset of the crystal was collected at 30 K at station BL41XU of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). The helium cryo-stream at 30 K considerably reduced the X-ray damage, as compared to the nitrogen cryo-stream at 100 K. The resulting dataset was processed with the program suite HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The crystal belongs to the space group R32, with unit cell dimensions ° ° of a b 230.8 A, c 269.3 A, 90 , and 120 . Structure Determination and Refinement Using the free-form ArcTGT structure (Ishitani et al., 2002; PDB entry 1IQ8) as a search model, molecular replacement was performed by the program MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997). The solution was further refined with the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998), by ¨ rigid-body refinement procedures. In the resultant 2m|Fo| D|Fc| and m|Fo| D|Fc| maps, we clearly found the tRNA electron densities. The models of the tRNAs were built using the program O (Jones et al., 1991), and were refined with CNS by energy minimization and simulated annealing procedures. Non-crystallographic symmetry re° straints (weight 300 kcal mol 1 A 2) were only applied on the mainchain coordinates of each protein monomer. Finally, the ArcTGT· tRNAVal model structure was refined with an R-factor of 22.5% (Rfree ° 28.8%) up to 3.3 A resolution. The Ramachandran plot analysis with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) showed that 99.2% of the protein residues are in the most favored and additionally allowed regions. Molecular graphics pictures in Figures 1­6 were

prepared by using the programs Que (http://www.biochem. s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ ishitani/que/) and Dino (http://www.dino3d.org/). Mutational Analyses The ArcTGT mutation, (463­466), was introduced as described (Ishitani et al., 2002). The mutants were overproduced and purified in the same way as the wild-type ArcTGT. The correct folding of the (463­466) mutant was confirmed by the dynamic light scattering analysis (data not shown). The tRNA variant with the mismatched DV helix (from 45-GGUC-48 to 45-AAG-48) was constructed and transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase, as described (Watanabe et al., 2000). The guanine-exchange activity was assayed as described (Watanabe et al., 2000). The 60 l reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 400 mM NaCl, and 10 M [8-14C]guanine hydrochloride. The concentrations of ArcTGT and tRNA were fixed to 80 M and 300 nM, respectively. The initial velocity (V0) of the guanine-exchange activity was measured at 45 C. The relative activity of each mutant was defined as the ratio of the initial velocity to that of the normal tRNAVal catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme.
