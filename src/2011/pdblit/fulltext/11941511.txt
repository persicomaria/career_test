Abstract We have synthesized and crystallized in the presence of Zn2+ ions the peptidyl-oligonucleotide adduct CH3CO-(Arg)4-NH-(CH2)6-NH-p-d(CGCAATTGCG). This is the first structure obtained from a deoxyoligonucleotide crystallized in the presence of zinc ° ions. Zn ions are clearly visible in the 2.9 A resolution map. On the other hand, the peptide tail is not visible in the crystal structure as determined by X-ray diffraction. The terminal bases C1 and G10 are found in extra-helical positions. Their phosphates are ligands of a Zn2+ ion, located in a special position of the unit cell. This ion plays an important role in the packing arrangement, since it binds four different DNA molecules. Two other Zn2+ ions are also important for DNA packing. They interact specifically with the N7 atoms of the terminal G2 and G10 bases, but not with the internal G8. This result supports the hypothesis that transition metals do

not interact with the bases of duplex DNA in the B form. Keywords X-ray diffraction Æ Zinc Æ Oligonucleotide structure Æ Guanine-ion interactions

Introduction
DNA interactions in different ionic environments play an important role in DNA function and should be studied in detail. We have recently reported [1, 2, 3] the structure of complexes of Ni2+ with oligonucleotides. Here we present the first crystal structure of a DNA fragment in the presence of Zn2+. This ion has a mild denaturing effect on DNA [4]. It may interact with several electron donor nitrogens of the DNA bases and thus disrupt the duplex structure. It also plays a role in some metal-mediated nucleases [5]. In the past two years, several atomic resolution oligonucleotide structures have been determined, but such high resolution cannot be attained in all cases. In many instances the intermolecular interactions in the crystal limit its intrinsic resolution owing to the presence of disordered regions, large solvent channels, etc. Mediumresolution X-ray structures, however, can display the essential features of DNA-ion interactions, in particular when transition metal ions are studied, since these have a comparatively high scattering power. In this line of endeavor, we recently determined the structure of two oligonucleotides [1, 3] in the presence of Ni2+ at a similar relatively low resolution. Nevertheless, in such cases the refinement process has to be carried out with great care. Therefore we describe in detail all the steps in our calculations in the Materials and methods section. Our studies have been carried out with the peptidyloligonucleotide CH3CO-(Arg)4-NH-p-d(CGCAATTGCG), although the peptide part of the molecule did not appear to be ordered. Although we tried conventional buffers, with variable amounts of Mg2+ and spermine, we only obtained suitable crystals in the

presence of Zn2+. The structure determined in this work shows appropriate DNA sites for Zn2+ ions. It also explains the essential role that Zn2+ ions may play in DNA crystal arrangements.

Materials and methods
Synthesis The self-complementary oligodeoxynucleotide p-d(CGCAATT GCG) bearing the 5¢-terminal phosphate group was synthesized by the phosphotriester method in solution, as described elsewhere [6, 7, 8]. After deprotection this oligonucleotide was purified by ion exchange and reverse-phase (RP) chromatography. The peptidyl-oligonucleotide CH3CO-(Arg)4-NH-(CH2)6NH-p-d(CGCAATTGCG) was prepared from the cetavlon salt of p-d(CGCAATTGCG). Thus 50 optical units of p-d(CGCAA TTGCG) at 260 nm were dissolved in 60 lL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); then 10 mg triphenylphosphine, 10 mg 2,2¢-dipyridyl disulfide and 5 mg dimethylaminopyridine were added. The reaction mixture was kept at 56 °C for 15 min. After that, 3 mg of the oligopeptide [CH3CO-(Arg)4-NH-(CH2)6-NH3]Æ5HCl in 50 lL of DMSO were added to the activated oligonucleotide and the mixture was kept for 90 min. The oligonucleotide material was precipitated with 2% LiClO4 in acetone. The precipitate was washed with acetone, dissolved in water (1.5 mL) and purified by RP HPLC at high temperature. The purity of the isolated peptidyl-oligonucleotide was higher than 98%, as determined by analytical ion exchange and RP HPLC. The retention time of the obtained product increases on the RP column (+14 min) and decreases on the IE column (­10 min) in comparison with the parent oligonucleotide. The presence of the phosphoramide bond in the product was proved also by its selective hydrolysis in a mild acidic condition. Crystallization The adduct was crystallized using a batch method in hanging drops containing 0.5 mM adduct, 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7), 0.75 mM Zn acetate and 10% MPD. The crystals grew in two months to an approximate size of 0.1 mm·0.2 mm·0.1 mm at room temperature. Higher concentrations of Zn resulted in precipitation, probably as a result of disruption of the duplex structure and aggregation of single strands. Data collection Crystals were transferred stepwise into solutions containing an increasing concentration of MPD to a final concentration of 35%. Then they were flash-cooled in a fiber loop at 100 K. Data were ° collected using synchrotron radiation (k=0.976 A) at EMBL beamline X11 in the Deustches Elektronen Synchrotron Hamburg Outstation on a 345 mm MAR Research imaging plate scanner. The data obtained were processed and merged with the HKL package [9]. Crystal and diffraction data are given in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The decamer duplex structure previously determined [10] in the I212121 space group was used as a starting model in a molecular replacement search. The solution was obtained using data between ° 15 and 2.9 A. It was characterized by a correlation coefficient of 72.2% and an R-factor of 42.4%. The structure was refined in XPLOR 3.8 [11], with the last steps being done in CNS [12]. Data ° below 8 A resolution were omitted in the refinement, as recommended in XPLOR [11]. Refinement was carried out against 90% of the measured data. A 10% subset of reflections was kept for cross-validation testing (R-free). The characteristics of the refine-

ment are listed in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the behavior of R-work and R-free during the refinement, with each step being described below. Since a preliminary electron density map did not confirm the position of residue cytosine 1 (C1) in the model, this residue was removed together with the neighboring phosphate group. Thus, the initial R-work and R-free were 45.3% and 41.1%. Successive rigidbody refinements with an increasing number of bodies (step 2: each residue as a body; step 3: two and three rigid groups per residue) and refinement of the B-factors (step 4) decreased the initial Rvalues respectively to 34.7% and 32.8%. Then, we added (step 5) the initially removed groups using new 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc maps. We checked two alternative insertions of C1. In one case the base moiety was placed close to a neighbor DNA molecule (unfilled symbols in Fig. 1); in another case the 5¢-end phosphate group was placed in that position (filled symbols in Fig. 1). Since the two alternatives were characterized by very similar R-values (step 5 in Fig. 1), we continued refinement with both of them. After rigidbody and B-factor refinement of the inserted part (step 6), a Zn2+ ion (Zn11), a ZnO5 group1 (Zn12) and four water molecules were added to the model (step 7). The R-values decreased significantly in both cases. We then added (step 8) another ZnO5 group (Zn13), two more water molecules, and recalculated the electron density maps. Although the R-values were decreasing in both cases, the 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc maps recalculated at this step made it clear that the second model is the correct one. Both the C1 base (Fig. 2b) and its 5¢-end phosphate (Fig. 2a) displayed an appropriate electron density map. Adequate difference density for coordinated water molecules also appeared next to Zn11, as shown in Fig. 2a. Manual correction of C1 and insertion of seven additional water molecules into the difference density confirmed the chosen model (step 9). At step 10 we removed two previously inserted water molecules and added six additional water molecules. At step 11, we made a final revision of the recalculated electron density maps and inserted three more water molecules, so that the model at this step contained 20 water molecules. R-work/R-free were 23.1%/22.5% for all reflec° tions in the resolution range 8­2.9 A. Reprocessing the X-ray data and addition of two new reflections to the test set and eight to the work set (step 12) did not change R-work but resulted in an increase of R-free to 25.1%. In order to confirm our structure, we refined it again with the CNS program, with idealized B-DNA as the initial model. We applied an initial anisotropic B-factor correction and made a rigidbody refinement of a DNA fragment with an increasing number of Table 1 Crystal data and refinement statistics Space group Cell dimensions Asymmetric unit contents C2221 ° a=27.92 A ° b=44.09 A ° c=53.22 A One DNA strand 0.5 Zn+2 ion 2 ZnO5 groupsa (q=0.75, 0.90)b 29 H2O 748 3.1 92.8/83.3 0.12/0.49 ° 8­2.9 A 631/70 81.9/9.1 20.8/21.6 ° 0.006 A/1.1°

The occupancy of Zn12 and Zn13 was diminished to 0.9 and 0.75, which slightly improved the electron density map and decreased the value of the B-factors for these ions. At the same time, although residue C1 had high B-factors, its occupancy was kept equal to unity and produced an adequate electron density map (Fig. 2b). An addition of nine water molecules (step 14) decreased R-work/R-free to 20.8%/21.6% and made a cleaner final map. It should be emphasized that during the whole refinement the Zn2+ ions appeared as very clear, large electron density peaks. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Nucleic Acid Database, code UD0012 [13].

Overall features The oligonucleotide crystal has a single strand in the asymmetric unit. The unit cell contains eight such strands which form four duplex molecules, as shown in Fig. 3. Each duplex has eight Watson-Crick base pairs while C1 and G10 at the ends occupy extra-helical positions. As a result of intrinsic flexibility of the oligoarginine chain, no trace of the peptide moiety could be

detected, only the phosphate which covalently binds the peptide to C1 was visible in the electron density map. The oligonucleotide duplexes are organized as infinite columns in the z direction. The unit cell is similar to that found by Spink et al. [10] for the same oligonucleotide sequence at room temperature, but the space group is different, since they obtained crystals in the related space group I212121. The b dimension of the crystal is signifi° ° cantly larger (44.1 A versus 39.3 A) in our case, in spite of the fact that our data were collected at 100 K. The presence of disordered peptide could be one of the reasons for such an increase in volume. The comparatively low resolution found is another indication that peptide may be present in the large solvent channels of the unit cell, which contain very few ordered water molecules. Some electron density was found in close proximity to the terminal phosphate 1, which could not be interpreted as a water molecule. We consider it related to the disordered peptide.

The oligonucleotide structure is similar to that found by Spink et al. [10], as shown in Fig. 4. Only the first cytosine in the sequence lies in a different position, as will be discussed below. The helical parameters of the duplex as calculated with NEWHELIX only show small differences between both structures (not shown). The extra-helical guanine The terminal guanine (G10) lies in the narrow groove in the next duplex which is stacked on top of the reference molecule in the duplex columns (shown in Fig. 3) which run in the c direction in the crystal. It should be noted that neighbor helices are stacked, but do not form pseudo-continuous helices. Instead they are rotated to the left by about 70°. This interaction was first described by Spink et al. [10] and later found in many other cases [1, 2, 14, 15]. Other types of extra-helical guanine interactions are known, as reviewed elsewhere [16]. G10 interacts with G2 in the next duplex through hydrogen bonding of their N2 and N3 atoms. The position of the extra-helical guanine in the narrow groove is similar in all these structures. The extra-helical cytosine In general, guanines in terminal positions appear well ordered [16]. In contrast, terminal cytosines show a much greater range of variability. Quite often they appear disordered and cannot be detected in the electron density map [1, 2, 14, 17]. In other cases they may be associated with guanines in neighbor duplexes, either through Watson-Crick base pairs [18, 19] or forming a triplet [1, 3, 10]. It appears that cytosine has a wider range of variability than guanine. In fact there are theoretical analyses which predict [20] that the B-DNA conformation is not favorable for cytosine, which may explain why terminal cytosines appear to have a larger conformational space available to them. In our case the terminal cytosine C1 has a very unusual position. There is a rotation of about 180° around the phosphate-oxygen bond of G2 (a angle) so that C1 is then placed outside the duplex, with close van der Waals contacts with cytosine C3. It is also hydrogen bonded with one of the water molecules associated with Zn13, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The Zn2+ ions

Fig. 4 Comparison of the duplex structure of d(CGCAATTGCG) described here (black) in the presence of Zn2+ with that previously described [10], crystallized in the presence of Mg2+ in a related space group (gray). The overall structure is similar, including the extra-helical terminal guanine. The only difference lies in the terminal C1, which is at very different positions in either case. The ° RMS difference between both duplexes (residues 2­9) is 0.66 A

The Zn2+ ions offer special interest since this is the first B-DNA structure crystallized in the presence of such ions. We localized three Zn2+ ions in the asymmetric unit. Each of them is shown in a different color in Fig. 3. One of them (Zn11) lies on a dyad axis as shown in detail in Fig. 2a.

of hydration form hydrogen bonds both with a phosphate and with cytosine C1, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. These two ions (Zn12 and Zn13) lie at the expected positions next to guanines which are not embedded in a B-form duplex, as had already been found in Ni2+-oligonucleotide complexes [1, 2, 3]. Similar interactions occur in RNA when crystallized in the presence of Zn2+ [21]. The G8 base, which is in an internal position in the B-DNA duplex, does not interact with any detectable Zn2+ ion, but has a water molecule near the N7 atom. The Zn11 ion lies on a dyad axis, as is clear from Figs. 2a and 3. It is surrounded by four phosphate groups from four different molecules. This interaction is similar to that found previously in a dodecamer [17], where a Ca2+ ion was found in a similar position, also coordinated with four phosphate groups. Two additional water molecules are coordinated with Zn11, as indicated by the difference electron density map shown in Fig. 2a. Thus Zn11 shows a screwed octahedral coordination.

Discussion
Fig. 5 An illustration of the interactions of the hydrated Zn13, which is directly bound to the N7 atom of G2. Its waters of hydration are hydrogen bonded with O2 in C1 and with an oxygen of phosphate 2. It is also apparent that C1 shows van der Waals interactions with the major groove of the duplex

Two of the Zn2+ ions interact with the N7 atom of guanine molecules G2 and G10, as shown in detail in Fig. 6. The Zn12 ion (yellow in Fig. 3) has an approximate octahedral coordination with the N7 atom of G10 and five water molecules, one of which interacts with the O6 atom of the same guanine. The Zn13 ion (dark green in Fig. 3) interacts with G2. Its waters
Fig. 6 Electron density maps at the 1r level of the two hydrated Zn2+ ions which interact with G2 (at the end of the duplex region) and G10 (extra-helical). No such interaction was found with G8, which is in an internal position in the duplex

The crystal structure we have studied is formed by parallel columns of stacked oligonucleotides. Each column is stabilized by the interaction of G10 with the minor groove of the next oligonucleotide, as first described by Spink et al. [10]. The Zn2+ ions associated with G2 and G10 also contribute to stabilize the interaction between consecutive duplexes through hydrogen bonds formed by their hydration waters. On the other hand, there is only one clear interaction between neighbor oligonucleotide columns, shown in Figs. 2a and 3. The Zn11 ion not only reinforces the interactions between symmetry-related oligonucleotides in the same column (G10-G10, C1-C1) but appears to be the only feature which maintains the crystal lattice through intercolumn interaction (C1-G10). The absence of extensive visible interactions among oligonucleotide columns is not a unique feature of this

538

crystal structure. In fact, one of the striking features of many oligonucleotide crystals is the absence of order in the ion/water atmosphere found among duplexes. In the present case, very few water molecules and no ions could be detected in the central channel of the unit cell shown in Fig. 3. Disordered arginine residues may also be present in that channel. No water-mediated interactions were found among duplexes in different columns. It appears therefore that an ordered duplex structure may be maintained in the crystal in the absence of order in the ionic atmosphere. In the related structure reported by Spink et al. [10], neither the berenil molecules nor the Mg2+ ions used for crystallization were visible and very few water bridges among neighbor duplex columns could be detected. The overall packing of the duplex columns as shown in Fig. 3 is similar to that found by Spink et al. [10], who obtained crystals in the I212121 space group. The difference with our structure, which crystallizes in the C2221 space group, is the orientation of the central duplex columns shown in Fig. 3, which owing to the different packing symmetry are rotated 180° when compared with those found by Spink et al. [10]. As a result, the extrahelical G10 residues in neighbor columns face each other in the latter case and interact by hydrogen bonding with water molecules placed between the N7 atoms. Thus a G10-G10 interaction appears between different columns, which is absent in our case. We instead find an interaction between the G10 phosphates in the same column mediated by the Zn11 ion, as shown in Fig. 2a. It is striking that this decamer, as well as d(CGTATATACG) [1, 2], crystallize with terminal base pairs which do not form part of the duplex structure and show extra-helical interactions. In contrast, all other B-DNA decamers (reviewed by Tereshko and Subirana [22]) form pseudo-continuous duplex columns with their terminal base pairs as part of the duplexes. Three different crystal forms of the decamer d(CGCAATTGCG) are already represented in the NDB [13]. In one of them (entry BDJ069) the terminal bases are part of a duplex; in two other cases (entries GDJ046 and UDJ031) they are extra-helical, as well as in our crystal. Such a behavior may be influenced by the initial sequence CGY, which might destabilize the terminal base pairs and, eventually, by the presence of transition metals which may prevent the first base pair being incorporated into the duplex structure through their interaction with the N7 of G2. Nevertheless, no transition metals were used by Spink et al. [10], who also found extra-helical terminal base pairs. With regard to the Zn2+ ions, they show similar features to Ni2+ ions [1, 2, 3]. In all cases the transition metals do not interact with the N7 atoms of guanines which are placed in the duplex sequence, G8 in this case, but they do interact with all the guanines in a terminal (G2) or extra-helical (G10) position. This behavior gives further support to the suggestion [23] that the interaction of transition metals with the N7 atom of guanine is not feasible in the B-DNA helix.

Although a substantial number of studies [24] have covered the interaction of transition metals with DNA and their biological activity, this is the first deoxyoligonucleotide which has been crystallized in the presence of Zn2+ ions. The interaction of Zn2+ with either the terminal or extra-helical guanines suggests a higher affinity of this ion for denatured DNA, which may explain its denaturing influence on DNA in solution [4].
