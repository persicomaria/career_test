Monovalent cation binding sites on nucleic acids in solution can be localized using the isotopically labeled ammonium ion (15NH) as a probe in 4 high resolution NMR spectroscopy experiments. The application of this technique to a series of DNA duplexes reveals a preference for the binding of ammonium cations in the minor groove of A-tract sequences. These results are consistent with a recent report which indicates that some solvent electron densities previously identi®ed as water molecules in DNA X-ray crystal structures are partially occupied by sodium ions. The sequence-speci®c nature of monovalent cation binding sites demonstrated here for A-tract DNA provides an explanation for the origin of sequence-directed bending.

Segments of double-stranded DNA composed of four to eight consecutive A ÁT base-pairs without a TpA step are collectively known as A-tracts. DNA molecules which contain an A-tract, or multiple Atracts phased with respect to the helical twist of DNA, contain a signi®cant bend in their helical axis (Hagerman, 1990). While A-tracts have been shown to exhibit structural properties which are unique with respect to most other DNA sequences (e.g. high propeller twist of base-pairs and a narrow minor groove; Dickerson & Drew, 1981; Nelson et al., 1987; Shatzky-Schwartz et al., 1997), the origin of helix bending by A-tracts has remained unresolved for nearly 20 years (Dickerson et al., 1994; Diekmann et al., 1992; Haran et al., 1994). Various models which have been proposed differ even in the attribute of bend location, e.g. in the A-tract itself (wedge model; Bolshoy et al., 1991; Trifonov & Sussman, 1980), at the junction between A-tract and non-A-tract sequences (junction model; Koo et al., 1986), and in all non-A-tract DNA (bent general sequence model; Goodsell & Dickerson, 1994; Olson et al.,

1993). X-ray crystal structures of DNA oligonucleotides containing A-tracts show a straight helix (Dickerson et al., 1994, 1996; Shatzky-Schwartz et al., 1997), providing support for models which place the bend outside the A-tract. However, the relationship between A-tract crystal structures and solution state studies of DNA curvature has remained controversial (Dickerson et al., 1996; Ganunis et al., 1996; Sprous et al., 1995). The degree of helix bending induced by A-tracts, as monitored by gel mobility assays, depends upon the ionic strength and the species of associated cation (Diekmann, 1987; Diekmann & Wang, 1985). This suggested to us the possibility that A-tracts bind cations in a unique fashion which ultimately results in bending of the DNA helical axis (Hud & Feigon, 1997), just as DNA bending can result from the asymmetric reduction of phosphate repulsions by phosphate neutralization and covalently tethered cations (Strauss & Maher, 1994; Strauss et al., 1996a,b). We have shown that DNA oligonucleotides containing A-tracts localize divalent cations differently with respect to non-A-tract sequences (Hud & Feigon, 1997). However, most studies of helical axis bending of DNA polymers by A-tracts have been carried out in the presence of only monovalent cations (Crothers & Drak, 1992). Thus, if cation binding is responsible for A-tract-induced bending, then monovalent cations must also bind

652 duplex DNA in a sequence-speci®c fashion. This would defy conventional wisdom, since monovalent cations have generally been considered to bind duplex DNA in a delocalized manner, with little or no sequence speci®city (Braunlin, 1995). Two recent studies, a molecular dynamics study (Young et al., 1997) and an analysis of a high-resolution DNA crystal structure (Shui et al., 1998), have challenged this view. To investigate the possibility of monovalent cation localization on DNA duplexes in solution, we have studied the binding of NH to several double-stranded DNA oligonu4 cleotides which contain runs of A ÁT base-pairs using NMR methods. We have recently shown that the isotopically labeled ammonium ion (15NH) can be used in 1H4 NOESY (nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy) experiments as a probe of monovalent cation binding sites in a DNA quadruplex under conditions in which bound ammonium ions are in slow exchange with bulk ammonium ions (<20 sÀ1; Hud et al., 1998, 1999). In that case, the bound 15 NH gave rise to resonances with chemical shifts 4 distinct from the bulk 15NH, and therefore NOE 4 cross-peaks between the DNA and the shifted  15 NH4 resonances can be used to localize the ions. Here, we demonstrate that 15NH is an excellent 4

probe of alkali ion binding sites even for conditions of fast exchange. With this technique we have found that oligonucleotides containing A-tract sequences known to induce helical axis bending (i.e. A4T4 and A5) bind NH in the minor groove. 4 Results for related sequences known not to induce helical axis bending (i.e. T4A4 and A3GCT3) are dramatically different. The NH binding sites 4 identi®ed are consistent with the recent analysis of a DNA dodecamer crystal structure at high resolution, which suggests that sodium ions share occupancy with water molecules at speci®c sites in the minor groove ``spine of hydration'' (Shui et al., 1998). NH binds to specific sites in the minor 4 groove of DNA A-tracts The binding of NH to several DNA duplexes 4 was investigated in the presence of Na and Li counterions. Titration of NH into DNA samples 4 did not result in any observable changes in the one-dimensional (1D) 1H spectra. Selected regions from a NOESY of 2.0 mM [d(GCAAAATTTTGC)]2 in the presence of stoichiometric Na counterion and 4.0 mM 15NH are shown in Figure 1. 4

Quadrature detection in F1 was achieved using the States-TPPI phase cycle (Marion et al., 1989). The sweep width was 5000 Hz in F2 and 10000 Hz in F1.

653 [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 NOEs from NH are observed 4 to the A4H2, A5H2 and A6H2 resonances (spectrum with Li as stoichiometric counterion are shown Figure 2(b)). The same results were obtained in the MINSY spectrum and with Na as the stoichiometric counterion (data not shown). The greater intensity of the NH NOE to 4 A6H2, with respect to those of A4H2 and A5H2, provides evidence that NH binding is most 4 favored near the center of the A4T4 segment of the duplex. However, the detection of an NH 4 Ê NOE to A4H2 (separated from A6H2 by $7.5 A) indicates NH binding in the minor groove must 4 be more extensive than a single site located at the center of the duplex. Conversely, the smaller intensity of the NH NOE to A4H2, as compared 4 to those to A5H2 and A6H2, suggests that NH 4 binding does not extend appreciably outside of the central four A ÁT base-pairs of the duplex. Since the 2-amino protons of guanine exchange readily with solvent, these protons cannot be used in place of adenine H2 protons for NH 4 localization. Fortunately, the deoxyribose H4' protons also line the minor groove, and provide additional NOEs for localization of NH. We 4 detect NH NOEs to the H4' protons of A and T 4 residues in [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 but not to those of G or C residues (Figure 1), which localizes the binding sites for NH binding to within the A-tract 4 region of this duplex. No direct NOEs to NH 4 are observed from any protons in the major groove of the DNA. We have also investigated the interaction of NH with the closely related duplex 4 [dGCA3CGT3GC]2 in which the eight base-pair Atract of the previous sequence is reduced to two runs of three A ÁT base-pairs that are separated by a GC step. At least four A Á T base-pairs are generally considered to constitute an A-tract (Hagerman, 1990; Koo et al., 1986). For this sequence, binding of NH is virtually undetect4 able by the experimental protocols described here (data not shown). This substantial reduction in NH binding with respect to [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 4 further supports NH binding as being particular 4 to the minor groove of A-tracts. Results obtained for the duplex d(GCA5CG) Á d(CGT5GC), which contains an Atract composed exclusively of ApA steps, are similar to those described for [d(GCA4T4GC)]2. NOEs in the 1D 15N-®ltered NOESY (and MINSY, data not shown) spectrum are observed at the chemical shifts of the A5H2 and A6H2 protons of d(GCA5CG) Á d(CGT5GC) (Figure 2(c) and (d)), which indicates that NH again binds in the minor 4 groove of the A-tract. This illustrates that the ApT step, which lies at the center of the NH binding 4 sites of [d(GCA4T4GC)]2, is not required for the generation of an NH binding site. This also pro4 vides an additional example that sequences such as A4T4, which contain a single ApT step, have physical and chemical properties similar to A-tracts comprised exclusively of ApA steps.

In this 15N-decoupled spectrum, 15NH exhibits a 4 single 1H resonance, which has the same chemical shift as 15NH under similar conditions (i.e. 4 temperature, pH and ionic strength) but in the absence of DNA. Furthermore, within experimental error of sample conditions, no difference in the line width of the NH resonance was 4 detected in the presence of the DNA duplex. This strongly suggests that any NH which interact 4 with the DNA duplex are in fast exchange with solution. In the NOESY spectrum, cross-peaks are observed between the NH and DNA AH2 pro4 ton resonances, as well as to deoxyribose H4' resonances (Figure 1(a) and (b)). We focus our discussion initially on the NH cross-peaks to 4 A6H2 and A5H2. Since these DNA protons are located in the minor groove, direct NOEs to the NH ions would localize these ions to speci®c 4 sites in the minor groove of the duplex. However, the presence of the exchange cross-peak between the NH and the water resonance, as 4 well as the NOE cross-peaks between AH2 protons and the water resonance (Figure 1), raises the possibility that NOEs between NH and 4 DNA proton resonances are exchange-relayed through water molecules bound in the minor groove (Macura & Ernst, 1980; van de Ven et al., 1988). The standard NOESY experiment would give rise to cross-peaks for both cases. The exchange-relay pathway for magnetization transfer can be eliminated by simply irradiating the water resonance during the mixing time of a NOESY experiment (MINSY, mixing irradiation during a NOESY experiment; Massefski & Red®eld, 1988; Macura et al., 1994). Figure 1(c) and (d) shows the results of this experiment. The cross-peaks observed between water and the DNA AH2 proton resonances in the standard NOESY are completely gone in the MINSY spectrum, and all that remains of the water-NH 4 exchange cross-peak is a far less intense dispersive signal. In contrast, the A5H2 and A6H2 NOE cross-peaks to NH are present at essen4 tially the same intensity as observed in the standard NOESY spectrum. Thus, the cross-peaks between the AH2 and NH cannot be the result 4 of magnetization relayed through water. The location of the AH2 protons on the ¯oor of the minor groove make these non-exchangeable protons ideal for determining the extent to which NH binds in the minor groove of the 4 A4T4 segment of the duplex. However, detection of NH NOEs to A3H2 and A4H2 is less 4 straightforward than for A5H2 and A6H2. The near spectral overlap of A3H2 and NH makes it 4 impossible to detect a cross-peak between these two resonances. Additionally, any possible crosspeak between NH and A4H2 would be 4 obscured in NOESY spectra by the presence of the A3H2-A4H2 cross peak (Figure 1). This latter problem can be circumvented by acquisition of 1D 15N-®ltered NOESY or MINSY spectra. In the 15 N-®ltered NOESY spectrum of 1D

All 1D 15N-®ltered NOESY spectra have been baseline corrected using Lorentzian functions to ®t the 15NH 4 doublet. Missing regions in these spectra correspond to the most intense portion of the 15NH doublet, 4 which could not be adequately base line corrected. The broad resonance observed near 8.2 ppm all in 1D 15N®ltered NOESY spectra is the result of a proton exchange with the amino group of the terminal C residues (designated by *). Protons were not decoupled from 15N during ®d acquisition to avoid decoupler artifacts. NMR samples contained 60 mM Li (pH 5.5), 95 % H2O, 5 % 2H2O. Spectra were collected with 4 K complex points and a sweep width of 10000 Hz. The 1D 1H NMR spectra are the result of 128 accumulated scans. The 1D 15N-®ltered NOESY and spectra are the result of 12 K accumulated scans. Mixing time for the 15N-®ltered NOESY was 60 ms. Water suppression was accomplished in all spectra using the 11 echo pulse ÂÏ sequence (Sklenar & Bax, 1987).

A DNA oligonucleotide which contains an A-tract sequence that does not give rise to macroscopic bending binds NH differently 4 The TpA step has been shown to disrupt a number of anomalous physical and chemical properties associated with A-tracts, including helix bending (Hagerman, 1986) and narrowing of the minor groove (Chuprina et al., 1991; Hud & Feigon, 1997; Katahira et al., 1990). To investigate the effect of a TpA step on NH binding we investigated the 4 duplex [d(CGT4A4CG)]2. The spectra shown in Figure 2 illustrate that the binding of NH to this 4 molecule is dramatically different from the two previously discussed A-tract containing oligonucleotides. For [d(CGT4A4CG)]2, NH binding is 4 most favored in the minor groove near the A9pA10 step. The difference in distribution of localized ions, with respect to [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 and d(GCA5CG) Ád(CGT5GC), is illustrated in Figure 3. In addition, the intensities of the NH NOEs to the 4 AH2s of the sequence element T4A4 are considerably smaller than those observed for A4T4. This difference in NOE intensities can be attributed either to a reduced occupancy of the minor groove

by NH, or to the binding of NH at a site more 4 4 distant from the AH2s. NH ion binding sites correlate with observed 4 groove widths and electrostatics for DNA A-tracts The locations of NH binding observed for 4 [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 and d(GCA5CG) Ád(CGT5GC) correlate well with a structural feature particular to A-tract DNA. X-ray diffraction (Coll et al., 1987; Fratini et al., 1982; Nelson et al., 1987), NMR spectroscopy (Chuprina et al., 1991; Katahira et al., 1988, 1990; Nadeau & Crothers, 1989) and chemical probing (Burkhoff & Tullius, 1987) all indicate that the minor groove of A-tract DNA is narrow with respect to canonical B-form DNA. There is also substantial solution state evidence that the minor groove of A-tract DNA progressively narrows in the 5H 3 3H direction and achieves a minimum width at approximately four base-pairs (Chuprina et al., 1991; Katahira et al., 1988, 1990). For the symmetric sequence element A4T4 the minor groove narrows from both ends towards the central ApT

655 at this step, despite the fact that NH are localized 4 to both sides of this step. In essence, with respect to groove width and monovalent cation binding properties exhibited by A5 and A4T4, T4A4 behaves as two autonomous four base-pair A-tracts (Figure 3). The correlation between groove widths and NH 4 binding sites also needs to be considered in the context of potential monovalent cation coordination sites. Based on non-linear Poisson-Boltzman calculations on DNA duplexes, it has been proposed that runs of A ÁT base-pairs create extended electrostatic pockets in the minor groove that are sites for monovalent cation localization (Young et al., 1997). The electronegative thymine O2 carbonyl groups, as well as the close approach of the phosphate backbone, apparently contribute to the formation of a coordination site for NH in the 4 A-tract minor groove. For [d(GCA4T4GC)]2, the cross-strand O2 thymine oxygen atoms of the ApT step and the sequential O2 thymine oxygen atoms Ê of the ApA steps (separated by $4 A in both cases) are at relative positions ideal for cation coordination. In contrast, the two cross-groove O2 thymine oxygen atoms of a TpA step are too distant Ê from one another ($8 A) to participate directly in cation coordination. The N3 of adenine bases in a Ê TpA step are $4 A apart, and have also been predicted to facilitate monovalent cation binding (Bartenev et al., 1983; Young et al., 1997), however, our results do not support this hypothesis.

(1991) and Katahira et al. (1988, 1990). The location of NH binding sites deduced 4 from the data described here are indicated by black ellipses. A, C, G and T bases are shown in red, orange, blue and green, respectively.

NH binds in the same sites as those found 4 for Na in high resolution nucleic acid crystal structures While X-ray crystallography can provide an unparalleled view into how macromolecules coordinate cations, monovalent cations are rarely reported in nucleic acid crystal structures. This is generally because the resolution to which most nucleic acid crystal structures have been determined is not suf®cient to distinguish between water and monovalent cations, particularly Na which has the same number of electrons as H2O (Nayal & Dicera, 1996). Williams and co-workers (Shui et al., 1998) recently presented a reevaluation of the crystal structure of the ``Dickerson'' dodecamer, [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)]2, based upon a new Ê higher resolution data set (1.4 A). They conclude that solvent electron densities within the minor groove, previously interpreted as bound waters (Drew & Dickerson, 1981), are partially occupied by Na. The inner-most of these Na are in direct contact with the ¯oor of DNA minor groove, and the site with the highest Na occupancy is located at the central ApT step of [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)]2. The crystal structure of the RNA protohelix formed by the analogous dinucleotide ApU solved over 20 years ago also showed a coordinated sodium ion between the two cross-strand uridine O2 oxygen atoms (Seeman et al., 1976).

step (Figure 3; Hud & Feigon, 1997; Katahira et al., 1990). Our data demonstrate that NH binding is 4 most favored in the narrowest region of the A-tract minor groove of [d(GCA4T4GC)]2. In the case of d(GCA5CG) Ád(CGT5GC), the narrowing of the minor groove is expected to be asymmetric, with the narrowest point on the 3H side of the central A ÁT base-pair (Figure 3). The strongest NH NOEs 4 to A5H2 and A6H2 of this duplex again show that NH binding is most favored in the narrowest 4 region of the A-tract minor groove. and In contrast to [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 d(GCA5CG) Ád(CGT5GC), the eight consecutive A ÁT base-pairs of [d(CGT4A4CG)]2 contain a TpA step, which apparently widens the minor groove in the center of the run of A Á T base-pairs (Hud & Feigon, 1997; Katahira et al., 1990). The width of the minor groove at the TpA step likewise correlates with the absence of appreciable NH binding 4

656 The results we have reported here for NH local4 ization by A-tracts are completely consistent with those of Williams and co-workers (Shui et al., 1998), and provides solution state support for their conclusions. Conversely, this correspondence between the NH and Na binding sites provides exper4 imental support for the use of NH localization to 4 identify monovalent cation binding sites on DNA in the solution state, even under conditions of fast exchange. Although NH differs from the alkali 4 ions in having protons that can hydrogen bond, it is in fact an excellent probe of alkali ion binding sites. Selectivity between monovalent cations for binding is largely based upon the geometry of the coordination site and the size of the cation (Eisenman, 1962; Eisenman & Horn, 1983). It has long been appreciated that NH can substitute for K in a 4 multitude of K-dependent enzymes (Evans & Sorger, 1966; Suelter, 1970). Consistent with this observation, the radius of coordinated NH has 4 been argued to be extremely close to that of K based upon hydration enthalpies (Rashin & Honig, 1985). Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that both K and NH displace Na coordi4 nated in DNA quadruplexes in solution (Hud et al., 1996, 1998) and NH has been shown to occupy 4 coordination sites similar to those found for Na in a high-resolution crystal structure of a DNA quadruplex (Phillips et al., 1997). Since 4 mM NH 4 produces NOEs with protons in an A-tract minor groove even in the presence of 50 mM Na (Figure 1), A-tracts apparently favor NH coordi4 nation over Na, as has been shown to be the case for a DNA quadruplex (Hud et al., 1998). We also note that NH binds in A-tract minor grooves in the 4 presence of Li (Figure 3), which may be expected to follow since Li typically competes less successfully for monovalent cation binding sites in aqueous solution than Na (Eisenman, 1962; Eisenman & Horn, 1983).

mately 1 ns at 277 K; Denisov et al., 1997; Maltseva et al., 1998). Since the A4H2, A5H2 and A6H2 resonances of [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 exhibit NOEs to water (Figure 1), water molecules must also occupy the same region of the minor groove to which we have localized NH. 4 Since the chemical shift of bound NH is the 4 same as that of the bulk NH, bound NH is in 4 4 fast exchange on the NMR time-scale, and is thus bound with a submillisecond life-time. However, it is not possible to determine an upper limit on the bound NH residence times, since the actual 4 chemical shift of bound NH is not known. The 4 relative magnitude of the peaks at AH2 resonances in 15N-®ltered NOESY and ROESY (rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy) spectra for [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 (data not shown) provides a lower limit on the NH residence times of at least 4 1 ns (Denisov et al., 1997; Otting & Liepinsh, 1995). It therefore appears that water and NH are both 4 in fast exchange from the same coordination sites in the minor groove of A-tracts, with potentially similar residence times. These results support the proposal that at least some of the discrete electron densities observed in the minor grooves of A  Trich regions of B-form DNA are partially occupied by monovalent cations (Shui et al., 1998). Relationship of ion localization to DNA bending What do the NH binding sites described here 4 tell us about the origin of A-tract induced curvature? We and others have proposed (Hud & Feigon, 1997; Shui et al., 1998) that cations bound (or at least preferentially localized on a time-averaged basis) in the minor groove of A-tracts could cause the helical axis of DNA to bend in response to an asymmetric reduction in the electrostatic repulsion of phosphate groups across this groove (Mirzabekov & Rich, 1979; Strauss & Maher, 1994; Strauss et al., 1996a,b). Speci®cally, monovalent cations bound in the minor groove of an A-tract would be expected to cause a bend in the helical axis which is directed towards the minor groove monovalent cation binding site of the A-tract. This proposal and the monovalent cation binding sites identi®ed here are consistent with what has been elucidated experimentally for the location and direction of bends caused by A-tracts in solution, i.e. near the center of the A-tract and directed towards the minor groove (Zinkel & Crothers, 1987). As a speci®c example, the sites of the strongest NH localization for both A4T4 and A5 corre4 spond exactly to the bend centers as determined for these same sequences by polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic assay (Crothers & Drak, 1992). We speci®cally studied the NH binding sites of 4 [d(GCA4T4GC)]2 and [d(CGT4A4CG)]2 as a test of our theory for cation-induced bending. It had been demonstrated that DNA polymers of the sequence d(GCA4T4)n are bent, while those of the sequence d(CGT4A4)n are essentially straight (Hagerman,

Coexistence of bound water molecules and monovalent cations in the A-tract minor groove When the ®rst crystal structures of B-form DNA were determined, a spine of hydration was proposed to exist in the minor groove of the AATT segment of the duplex [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)]2 (Drew & Dickerson, 1981). Subsequently, the structures of a number of DNA duplexes containing A  T-rich sequences have been determined, and many show a similar pattern of electron densities within the minor groove (Shatzky-Schwartz et al., 1997). These have similarly been assigned as bound water molecules. NOEs between water molecules and DNA AH2 resonances of A-tracts have been analyzed extensively and used as support for the spine of hydration in solution (Denisov et al., 1997; Kubinec & Wemmer, 1992; Liepinsh et al., 1992). Recent NMR studies, however, have shown that the residence life-time of water molecules in the spine of hydration are relatively short (approxi-

657 curvature of the polymer. In contrast, Figure 4 also shows that the monovalent cation binding sites of multiple T4A4 sequence elements, when phased with respect to the helical twist of DNA, alternate between two opposite faces of the polymer. Thus, the sequence d(CGT4A4)n would be expected to produce no net macroscopic curvature, since the monovalent cation binding sites in T4 and A4 segments would cause equal but opposite bends in the helical axis. This destructive phasing of the two A-tract monovalent cation binding sites of T4A4 would have to be a signi®cant factor in the suppression of macroscopic bending, since a four basepair A-tract is suf®cient to cause bending (Koo et al., 1986), and T4A4 behaves essentially as two autonomous four base-pair A-tracts (Figure 3). This model for A-tract directed curvature is also consistent with a number of other observations concerning the sequence dependence of A-tractinduced helical axis bending. For example, DNA polymers comprised of the repeating sequence (GGCAANAACG)n exhibit pronounced curvature if N is A, yet are essentially straight if N is C, G or T (Koo et al., 1986). The origin of this cooperativity becomes apparent in the context of cation binding. In the present example, the potentially ®ve basepair A-tract is broken into two ApA steps when N is C or G, or into one three base-pair ``A-tract'' (i.e. AAT) and one ApA step when N is T. Based upon the results discussed here, we propose that [d(GGCAANAACG)]n only exhibits helix bending when N is A, because this is the only one of the four possible sequences which contains an A-tract long enough to create an appreciable minor groove monovalent cation binding site. One notable exception to the resistance of A-tracts to base-pair substitutions is the inosine Ácytosine (i.e. IÁC) base-pair. For example, duplex DNAs containing the sequence 5H -AAIAA-3H Á5H -TTCTT-3H exhibit curvature almost equal to that of the corresponding unsubstituted ®ve base-pair A-tract (Koo & Crothers, 1987). This is also consistent with our cation binding model, since the minor groove side of the IÁC base-pair is isomorphous with the A ÁT base-pair and would thus not be expected to disrupt the generation of the minor groove cation binding site.

Note that the reduced repulsion of phosphates across the minor groove due to monovalent cations localized in these regions of d(GCA4T4)n would be expected to cause the duplex to bend concave towards the reader. Duplex d(CGT4A4)n, rotated 90  with respect to d(GCA4T4)n, would not be expected to exhibit an appreciable net macroscopic curvature, since two monovalent cation binding sites are located on opposite faces of the DNA for each T4A4 sequence element. A, C, G and T bases are shown in red, orange, blue and green, respectively.

Divalent cation binding sites and DNA bending The anomalous electrophoretic mobility of Atract DNAs in polyacrylamide gels has been used extensively as a measure of sequence directed curvature (Crothers & Drak, 1992). The overwhelming majority of these studies have utilized electrophoresis buffers containing monovalent cations and the chelating agent EDTA. However, from the limited investigations reported where A-tract DNA gel mobility was measured in the presence of divalent cations, it is clear that sequence directed curvature can be very sensitive to the species of associated cation (Diekmann, 1987; Diekmann & Wang, 1985). Indeed, the apparent curvature of some DNAs con-

1986). Figure 4 shows that the monovalent cation binding sites for multiple A4T4 sequence elements, when phased with respect to the helical twist of DNA, lie all along one face of the polymer. Thus, the incremental bending of each A-tract towards these localized cation would result in macroscopic

658 taining A-tracts has been observed to increase in the presence of MgCl2, while the curvature of others has been observed to decrease (Diekmann, 1987). Two factors associated with cation localization, coupled with the phasing of sequence elements within the DNAs studied, could be the source of these observations. First, A-tracts also exhibit minor groove divalent cation binding sites which are distinct from those reported here for monovalent cations (Hud & Feigon, 1997). Secondly, some of the short sequence elements in the DNAs studied (which intersperse A-tracts in order to allow proper helical phasing) contain the dinucleotide steps GpG, GpA and GpT known to be major groove divalent cation binding sites (Froystein et al., 1993; Steinkopf et al., 1996). These could bind cations in the major groove and cause bending towards that groove (Rouzina & Bloom®eld, 1998). As an example, duplex DNA polymers containing a single d(GGGCCC) sequence element are macroscopically bent in the presence of divalent cations, in the opposite direction to that caused by A-tracts, i.e. towards the major groove, (Brukner et al., 1993). We have studied the duplex [d(CATG3C3ATG)]2 and veri®ed that its four GpG steps do in fact bind divalent cations in the major groove (N.V.H. & J.F., unpublished results). Thus, the general phenomenon of DNA sequence-directed curvature is consistent with the proposal that its origin lies in the sequence-speci®c binding of cations.

Note added in proof: While this manuscript was in review, Williams and co-workers published an Ê X-ray crystallographic study of the potassium form of the Dickerson dodecamer at 1.75 A (Shui, X., Sines, C. C., McFail-Isom, L., VanDerveer, D. & Williams, L. D. (1998). Biochemistry, 37, 16877± 16887.). The potassium binding sites reported by Shui et al. are consistent with the results presented here.
