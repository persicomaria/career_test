Crystal structure of a colicin N fragment suggests a model for toxicity
Ingrid R Vetter*, Michael W Parker*, Alec D Tucker§, Jeremy H Lakey#, Franc Pattus¶ and Demetrius Tsernoglou¥
Background: Pore-forming colicins are water-soluble bacteriocins capable of binding to and translocating through the Escherichia coli cell envelope. They then undergo a transition to a transmembrane ion channel in the cytoplasmic membrane leading to bacterial death. Colicin N is the smallest pore-forming colicin known to date (40 kDa instead of the more usual 60 kDa) and the crystal structure of its membrane receptor, the porin OmpF, is already known. Structural knowledge of colicin N is therefore important for a molecular understanding of colicin toxicity and is relevant to toxic mechanisms in general. Results: The crystal structure of colicin N reveals a novel receptor-binding domain containing a six-stranded antiparallel  sheet wrapped around the 63 Å long N-terminal  helix of the pore-forming domain. The pore-forming domain adopts a ten -helix bundle that has been observed previously in the pore-forming domains of colicin A, Ia and E1. The translocation domain, however, does not appear to adopt any regular structure. Models for receptor binding and translocation through the outer membrane are proposed based on the structure and biochemical data. Conclusions: The colicin N­ompF system is now the structurally best-defined translocation pathway. Knowledge of the colicin N structure, coupled with the structure of its receptor, OmpF, and previously published biochemical data, limits the numerous possibilities of translocation and leads to a model in which the translocation domain inserts itself through the porin pore, the receptor-binding domain stays outside and the pore-forming domain translocates along the outer wall of the trimeric porin channel.

Introduction
Colicins are plasmid-encoded bacteriocins, produced by Escherichia coli, that kill sensitive E. coli strains and related bacteria (for recent reviews see [1­5]). The cell envelope of gram negative bacteria, with its two membranes, presents a serious obstacle for the uptake of macromolecules of the size of colicins (40­60 kDa). To cross this barrier and reach their target, colicins must first bind to their cognate receptor on the cell surface and then translocate across the outer membrane. The pore-forming colicins (E1, A, B, N, Ia, Ib, K, 10 and 5) and colicin M, an inhibitor of murein biosynthesis, insert into the inner membrane, whereas colicins with nuclease activity (E2­E9 and cloacin DF13) must enter the cytoplasm. Uptake of colicins through the outer membrane follows two alternative pathways mediated by the Ton or Tol systems. These two systems are also involved in the transport of bacteriophage DNA into the cells. The Ton system consists of the proteins TonB, ExbB and ExbD and is also involved in the

energy-dependent uptake of vitamin B12 and iron siderophores [6,7]. The Tol system consists of six proteins: TolA, TolB, TolQ, TolR, PAL and Orf2 [8,9]. Group B colicins (B, D, Ia, Ib, M, 5 and 10) are taken up via the Ton pathway, whereas the translocation of group A colicins (A, E1­9, K, N and cloacin DF13) involves interaction with TolA and different combinations of the proteins from the Tol family [10­12]. Additional proteins are also essential for the translocation of some colicins: the porin OmpF for colicins A, K and N; TolC for colicins E1 and 10; and OmpA for colicin K [13]. Colicins consist of distinctive protein modules, which presumably originated from the genetic recombination of DNA fragments that encoded for different specialized functions. The N-terminal domain specifies the translocation route (Ton or Tol pathways), a central domain specifies the receptor, and a C-terminal domain carries the killing activity. Colicins E1 and 10 contain a fourth domain, the TolC

domain, located between the translocation and the receptor domains [14]. TonB-dependent colicins contain a homologous sequence of five amino acids, called the TonB box, in their N-terminal translocation domain, which is also present in TonB-dependent receptors [15]. The Tol-dependent colicins possess a glycine-rich and proline-rich region in their N-terminal translocation domains. The existence of a TolA box has been proposed with the following motif: Asp­Gly­ (Ser,Thr)­Gly­Trp [14]. But mutation of serine in this motif to phenylalanine in colicin E3 inhibits TolB binding instead [12] and the motif is present in only one subset of Tol-dependent colicins. Another TolA box with the motif Glu­Gly­Gly­Gly­Ser has been proposed for protein III of phage f1 [16]. There is experimental evidence that the N-terminal domains of both group A and group B colicins interact with components of the translocation system on the inner side of the outer membrane; translocation through the outer membrane therefore occurs during colicin uptake. Mutations in the TonB box of colicins B and M impaired uptake, but this was partially restored by a mutation in TonB [17]. Expression of the N-terminal domain of either colicin B or colicin E3 in the periplasm make E. coli strains tolerant to the corresponding colicins [12]. Pore-forming colicins induce voltage-dependent potassium and phosphate efflux across the plasma membrane of the target bacterium [18] and form voltage-gated ion channels in artificial membranes [19­23]. The pore activity is carried by the C-terminal domain [20,23]. Near the carboxyl end of the pore-forming domain is a hydrophobic segment present in all the pore-forming colicins. The crystal structure of the pore-forming domain of colicin A, solved to 2.4 Å resolution, revealed that this hydrophobic segment forms a buried -helical hairpin, surrounded by an outer bundle of eight amphipathic helices [24]. A similar fold has been identified recently in the crystal structures of the pore-forming domain of colicin E1 and the fulllength colicin Ia [25,26]. A large amount of data have been accumulated concerning the mechanism of membrane insertion and pore formation by this domain [1­4,27­31]. A unifying model has been proposed recently that reconciles various proposals on the orientation of the hairpin with respect to the membrane [32] and segments of the polypeptide chain have been identified that move across the membrane in response to voltage [33,34]. Much less is known about the mechanism of the colicin interaction with its receptor and the subsequent translocation of the toxin. The mechanism appears to follow the general rule that significant unfolding should occur prior to, or during, translocation [35]. Engineering disulphide bridges within the pore-forming domain of colicin A slows down translocation, but does not abolish it completely [36]. There is some experimental evidence that the colicin molecule spans the periplasmic space and contacts both the inner and outer membranes simultaneously [35]. The

recently solved tripartite structure of colicin Ia at 3.0 Å resolution [26] is compatible with such organization. The molecule is 210 Å long with the translocation and poreforming domains separated from the receptor-binding domain by a pair of helices, each 160 Å long. Colicin N, which belongs to the group A colicins, possesses similar properties and functions to other pore-forming colicins, but has a much shorter polypeptide chain (385 amino acids) and a single receptor. It thus provides a simpler model system than other colicins for pursuing structure­ function studies. Here, we present the crystal structure, at 3.1 Å resolution, of a large fragment of colicin N (missing the first 66 residues) that contains the pore-forming and the receptor-binding domains. The pore-forming domain adopts the canonical ten helix bundle seen in other colicins [24­26], whereas the receptor-binding domain adopts a novel fold. The crystal structure of the colicin N receptor, the protein ompF, which is one of the major unspecific porins from E. coli, has been solved previously at 2.4 Å resolution [37]. The structures have enabled us to look at possible interactions between the colicin receptor-binding domain and its receptor, leading to new insights into the translocation mechanism of colicins.

Results
The pore-forming domain

The structure of colicin N is shown in Figure 1 and the corresponding topology diagram is presented in Figure 2. The pore-forming domain of colicin N consists of a bundle of ten  helices arranged in three layers forming the socalled `globin-like' topology [38,39], also found in the poreforming apoptosis regulatory protein Bcl-xL [40]. This topology is identical to that observed in the pore-forming domains of other colicins (Figure 2; [24­26]). A characteristic feature of the pore-forming domains of colicins is their hydrophobic core consisting of a buried helical hairpin, formed by  helices 8 and 9, and surrounded by a cluster of aromatic residues. Although the hairpin is present in all pore-forming colicins, some colicins exhibit extensive deletions in this region, for example colicins E1 and Ia. Colicin N has a deletion of one amino acid in helix 8 compared to colicin A (corresponding to Leu165 in the colicin A pore-forming domain; see Figures 3 and 4). In addition, there is a proline residue (Pro346) close to the site of deletion (which is an alanine in colicin A). These changes do not shorten the loop adjacent to this helix, but disturb the structure of the helix itself. The helix loses one helical turn compared to colicin A, but the conformation of the proline residue ensures that the loop between helices 8 and 9 nearly retains the same conformation in both colicins (Figures 3 and 4; [41]). A remarkable feature of the hydrophobic core is its poor packing arrangement highlighted by a tube-like channel (Figure 5). The channel is created by virtue of the structural

alterations at the C-terminal end of helix 8 (compared to colicin A), which is six residues shorter than helix 9. The channel stretches from one side of the molecule almost through to the other side where it is met by a large depression formed by the loop between helices 3 and 4. It runs through the middle of the hydrophobic hairpin and is filled by four water molecules. The walls of the channel are formed mostly by hydrophobic residues with the exceptions being the sidechains of amino acids Trp365, Tyr347, Tyr309, Thr362, Ser305 and Trp270 and the mainchain carbonyls of Leu342 and Ser343. These residues contribute to the hydrogen bonding network that stabilizes the water molecules inside the channel.

The receptor-binding domain consists of a six-stranded  sheet wrapped around an  helix, which is an extension of -helix 1 from the pore-forming domain (Figure 1). In total, this helix is 63 Å long. The topology and secondary structure of the receptor-binding domain of colicin N is shown in Figure 2. Regions showing increased temperature factors, besides the N terminus, are located around residues 140, 150 and 164. These regions correspond to loop regions connecting  strands. There is no significant sequence similarity of the receptor-binding domains of colicin N to the other colicins, although OmpF also serves as a co-receptor of colicin A [10]. A search for similar

Figure 5 A stereoview showing the water-filled channel of colicin N running through the centre of the molecule. Some sidechains are labeled for better orientation. The water molecules are shown as red spheres. One water molecule, which sits in the funnel-shaped entrance to the channel, cannot be seen in this view. Other water molecules are located in the protein core, but have been omitted in this figure for clarity. The surface was calculated using the Connolly algorithm [72].

Contrary to the HLA molecule, the  strands of the colicin N receptor-binding domain resemble one half of a porin-like  barrel when viewed along the axis of central -helix 1 (Figure 1b). The relative arrangement of a  sheet wrapped around an  helix is also found in the protease inhibitor cystatin [42], although the topology is different. In cystatin, the  helix is connected to the opposite end of the  sheet compared to colicin N. There is also some superficial resemblance between the structures of colicin N and pilin [43]. Although there is no detectable sequence similarity between the two, both possess a long helix with a predominantly -sheet-containing domain tethered to one end. But the  sheet domains are located at different ends of the helix, the number of strands differ, the topology of the sheets is different, and pilin possesses a disulphide bridge. Intriguingly, however, both proteins translocate across the outer membrane of gram negative bacterial cells, although in opposite directions. The most prominent feature of the receptor-binding domain is the existence of two large clefts formed by the twisted  sheet (Figure 1). One cleft is formed by the  sheet wrapping around the long helix and is located at the interface between the two secondary structures (Figure 1b). This cleft is all hydrophobic and is particularly rich in aromatic residues. In the crystal structure, the cleft is completely filled by the long helix. The other cleft is formed on the opposite side of the sheet to the first cleft (Figure 1c). Unlike the first cleft, it is empty and fully solvent exposed. It contains a number of charged amino acid sidechains including two clusters of positively charged sidechains in the upper and lower parts of the cleft as well as two negatively charged residues in the centre of the cleft. It is tempting to assume that this cleft might be a ligand-binding pocket based on its shape and unusual

distribution of charged amino acids. During the structure determination it was noted that heavy atom reagents were prone to bind in the cleft.
Contacts between the pore-forming and receptor-binding domains

Besides the connecting  helix, there are few contacts between the receptor-binding and pore-forming domains. There are two potential hydrogen bonding interactions: the mainchain amide of Lys129 to the mainchain oxygen of Ile326 and the mainchain oxygen of Ser127 to the mainchain amide of Gly328. In addition, there are six van der Waals contacts. Thus, the interaction between the two domains is weak, probably allowing movements of the domains relative to each other in solution. Although the colicin N molecules in the crystal pack as head-to-tail dimers with the possibility of introducing conformational constraints on the inter-domain movement, it is not very likely that the weak interaction between the two domains is an artifact; because the shapes of the two domains are so different, a fit yielding a sufficiently large contact surface is impossible. The long helix connecting the two domains has one outstanding feature, namely a stretch of charged amino acids (Arg­Lys­Glu­Glu­Lys­Glu­Lys­ Asn­Glu­Lys­Glu) in the region between the two domains (Arg184­Glu194). Colicin Ia also possesses a highly charged stretch of sequence proceeding its pore-forming domain. The function of this stretch in either colicin remains to be elucidated.
The translocation domain

The translocation domain, located between residues 17 and 66 [44], has a glycine/proline/serine/asparagine-rich sequence, which is likely to have poorly defined secondary structure. The translocation domain is absent in the 3.1 Å

868

resolution structure, but the majority of it is present in the initial crystal form (see the Materials and methods section), which comprises residues 37­387. This region includes residues 58­61, which has been shown recently to be essential for binding to TolA [45]. There is no evidence of any density for the translocation domain; this is in complete accord with circular dichroism and fluorescence results, which demonstrate that this domain does not adopt any regular secondary structure [45,46].

A comparison of colicin receptor-binding and translocation domains

Discussion
A comparison of colicin pore-forming domains

The structure of the pore-forming domain of colicin N is very similar to the pore-forming domain of colicin A (Figure 3; [24]) as expected from the high pairwise sequence identity (56%) and very similar channel properties [22]. The rmsd between the mainchain atoms of the poreforming domains of colicin N and the mainchain atoms of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit of the colicin A crystal, denoted `A' and `B' respectively [41], is 1.31 Å and 1.25 Å (for these superpositions, residues 346­349 of colicin N and 162­166 of colicin A were omitted because colicin N has a one residue deletion in this region). The major differences in the superpositions (< 2 Å) were located at residues 215, 235 and 255 of colicin N compared to molecule B of colicin A and, additionally, at residues 285 and 325 compared to molecule A of colicin A. The differences in all these residues can be attributed to crystal contacts, although differences in the first three residues might also reflect genuine differences. Although the sequence similarities of colicin N to the pore-forming domains of colicins E1 and Ia are quite low (26% and 22%, respectively), they nevertheless exhibit very similar folds [25,26]. As well as the canonical ten helix bundle, the first helix is found to be extended to form a bridge to the receptor-binding domain present in the intact toxin. Other common features include the internal cavities surrounding the hydrophobic hairpin and patches of positive charge on the surface of the molecule. The internal cavities might be a key to structural rearrangements required for membrane insertion, whereas the patches of positive charge may be used for initial docking of the toxin molecule onto the membrane [41]. A significant difference between colicin N and colicins E1 and Ia is a shorter hydrophobic helical hairpin in colicins E1 and Ia. In contrast to colicin N, colicin Ia has three additional helices from the translocation domain, which are packed against the ten helices of the pore-forming domain [26]. Because the structures of the pore-forming domains of all the colicins are very similar, it is highly likely that their mechanism of membrane insertion and channel formation are also broadly similar. Detailed proposals for the mechanisms have been put forward and the interested reader is directed towards recent papers and reviews on the subject [1­5,25,32,41].

The receptor-binding domain of colicin N is a novel structure, quite unlike that found in the crystal structure of colicin Ia, which has been published recently [26]. But although colicin Ia belongs to the group B colicins and bears no sequence similarity with colicin N outside the region of the pore-forming domains, there are a number of interesting similarities in the structure and function of the two colicins. The receptor for colicin Ia is Cir, an outer membrane protein that probably adopts a -barrel topology similar to that of OmpF [5]. The TonB translocation machinery used by colicin Ia is analogous to the TolA system used by colicin N. Both TonB and TolA are thought to form extended rods that span the periplasm with an anchor in the periplasmic membrane. Accessory proteins (TolQ/TolR and ExbB/ExbD) in each system show significant sequence similarity [3,8]. The C-terminal domains of TonB and TolA are thought to provide binding sites for colicin translocation domains [47]. In colicin Ia, the receptor-binding and pore-forming domains are separated by a pair of 160 Å long helices. This compares with the single long 63 Å helix in colicin N. The receptor-binding domains of the two colicins share a superficial resemblance in that they both consist of a curved  sheet wrapped around a central, long  helix, which extends into the pore-forming domain to form the first helix of this domain. In the case of colicin Ia, however, the  sheet is composed of only two strands. Unlike colicin N, the much larger translocation domain of colicin Ia partially adopts regular secondary structure: three long helices. Interestingly, the TonB box is located in an extended coil of ~70 residues at the N terminus, which is about the same size as the entire colicin N translocation domain. Thus, in both colicins the precise region thought to interact with the translocation machinery adopts no structure and this flexibility maybe a key part of the recognition process.
Implications for the interaction of colicin N with OmpF

Colicin N has only one receptor, the matrix porin OmpF. This is in contrast to colicin A, which requires two different receptors, OmpF and BtuB, both located in the outer cell membrane [48]. Colicin N requires its receptor for full activity in vivo and the related porins, PhoE and OmpC, are associated with greatly reduced cellular sensitivities to colicin N [49,50]. Colicin N can bind to the three porins with similar affinity in vitro indicating that the complexes with PhoE and OmpC are poorly competent for translocation in vivo [51]. The OmpF protein has been closely investigated for its involvement in the reception and translocation steps of colicin N entry [50,52­54] and its crystal structure is known at 2.4 Å resolution [37]. Although all the domains of colicin N are mainly basic, the OmpF extracellular loops are mainly acidic. Several regions of OmpF

The proposed model for colicin N receptor-binding and translocation. The trimeric porin, OmpF, is shown in the outer membrane and Tol proteins are shown projecting into the periplasm from the inner membrane. For simplicity, the receptor-binding domain of colicin N is shown as a cusp-shaped object and the pore-forming domain is indicated by the cylindrical rods that represent the helices of that domain. The colicin N molecule is shown approaching the target

membrane and binding to OmpF via its receptor-binding domain. The translocation domain threads through the porin pore to interact with TolA in the periplasm. The pore-forming domain subsequently translocates to the inner membrane. The closed form of the colicin N channel is shown in the last panel. Application of a transnegative voltage would cause the helices lying on the surface of the membrane to insert and form the open channel.

have been identified that are necessary for the receptorbinding and the translocation steps of colicin N. Point mutations of Glu284 and Gly285, which are located on the outer rim of the porin channel, indicate that these residues are necessary for colicin N binding, but not for translocation [53]. Another colicin N-resistant point mutant is Gly119Asp, which is located in a loop within the porin pore, suggesting that the binding site is either deep inside the pore or that the pore represents part of the translocation pathway [53]. It is clear from looking at the size and shape of the colicin N molecule that the receptor-binding domain cannot possibly bind to residue 119. Even if one postulated conformational changes of OmpF in the region of residue 119, the domain cannot bind to residue 119 and residues 284 and 285 simultaneously. The crystal structure of the OmpF mutant, Gly119Asp, is known and shows only minor conformational changes [55]. Indeed, the mutation subdivides the existing pore into two smaller pores, suggesting that the effect of the mutation is to block the passage of some part of colicin N. These results suggest only one model of binding (Figure 6). In this model the colicin N receptor-binding domain sits like a plug above the pore of OmpF, with the pore-forming domain interacting with the outer rim and residues 284 and

285 of OmpF, and the translocation domain reaches down to, or past, residue 119. The solvent-exposed cleft in the colicin N receptor-binding domain forms interactions with the porin and there is a complementary interaction between the positively charged surface of the colicin and the negatively charged surface provided by the porin loops. There is experimental evidence that the translocation and the poreforming domains contribute significantly to the binding affinity: the receptor-binding domain (R) of colicin N alone or attached to the translocation domain (RT) have been overexpressed, purified and their affinity for OmpF, both in vivo and in vitro, were compared to the full-length colicin N and the fragment studied here (RP; [46]). All the twodomain fragments display a weaker affinity for OmpF than full-length colicin N, suggesting that molecular recognition is a property of the receptor domain but affinity is influenced by the entire molecule. This model also predicts that the OmpF pore would close on colicin N binding, which agrees with experiments in which the isolated R domain is found to block OmpF channels (J.H.L. and F.P., unpublished observations).
The translocation process and channel formation

The Tol machinery is located at adhesion zones between the two bacterial membranes. TolA is anchored through

a single transmembrane stretch to the cytoplasmic membrane. The C-terminal domain of ~120 residues is predicted to sit at the end of an enormously long helix that projects into the periplasm [8]. It is the C-terminal domain that interacts with the translocation domain of group A colicins [14,56]. Because the C-terminal domain of TolA resides in the periplasm, the translocation domain of colicin N must somehow traverse the outer membrane. Furthermore, the proximity of the receptor-binding domain to the TolA binding site, which is located at residues 59­62 [45], also provides a limitation on the distance between TolA and the receptor-binding domain of < 90 Å. There appear to be three possible distinct routes. The first is along the outside of the porin barrel, but this would require direct interaction with the lipid bilayer, which is energetically unfeasible. Second, the domain could slip through the porin pore or between a transient pore created between the monomers of the porin trimer. The third possibility requires destablization of the monomer interfaces, for which there is no experimental evidence. Indeed, the porin trimer is very stable and can only be dissociated in SDS at temperatures > 75°C [57]. Because the translocation domain appears to form a highly flexible coil, it is easy to envisage that the 66 residue domain could poke through the porin pore so as to make contact with the C-terminal domain of TolA, which is located underneath (Figure 6). This is also in agreement with the model presented above in which the translocation domain was proposed to interact with the OmpF pore in the initial receptor-binding step. The final step of the translocation process would be the passage of other parts of the toxin across the outer membrane. Proteolysis experiments with colicin A suggest that the receptor-binding domain remains attached to OmpF after channel formation in the inner membrane [35]. Engineering disulphide bonds between helices 1 and 2 and between helices 3 and 10 of the pore-forming domain of colicin A blocked the in vivo activity of the toxin without affecting pore formation in artificial membranes. These covalent linkages and others in the poreforming domain (between helices 2 and 10 and between helices 3 and 9) did not stop the translocation process across the outer membrane. These observations lead to the suggestion that helices 1­3 must span the periplasm of E. coli when the pore-forming domain is inserted into the inner membrane [58]. There is presently no evidence as to whether colicin N also spans both membranes and the only proteolysis studies on colicin N to date lend no support to the suggestion [54]. If colicin N did span the membrane, helix 1 is probably not long enough to span the entire periplasmic space in order to allow insertion of the pore-forming domain of colicin N whilst part of the molecule is still bound to OmpF. It has been shown, however, that helices 4­10 are sufficient for channel formation [59]. We suggest, by analogy to colicin A, that

helices 1­3 could form a single helix long enough for the toxin to insert in the cytoplasmic membrane and the receptor-binding domain can, if required, remain bound to the outside of the cell. (Because TolA is located at adhesion zones, it is likely that colicin N translocates at these sites. Thus, the required separation between the receptor-binding and pore-forming domains could be less for colicin N than for other colicins, which translocate at different sites.) The N-terminal half of helix 1 is sufficiently long to span a membrane and it is amphiphilic so the hydrophobic face could conceivably interact with the hydrophobic core of the outer membrane. These structural rearrangements are supported by calorimetry experiments, which reveal thermodynamics consistent with large structural changes occurring to colicin N on binding to OmpF [51] even though the receptor-binding and poreforming domains are very stable [46]. The model is also reminiscent of the model for colicin Ia, which is also postulated to span the periplasmic space by virtue of the unusually long helices that bridge the receptor-binding and pore-forming domains in that molecule [26]. The mechanism by which the pore-forming domain traverses the outer membrane is puzzling. It doesn't seem likely that it can pass through the porin pore. First, the pore would be plugged by the translocation and receptorbinding domains. Second, to fit through the pore, the toxin would require complete unfolding. Although the porin pore is sufficiently wide to allow the passage of the unstructured translocation domain, it is not wide enough to allow the passage of fully folded receptor-binding or pore-forming domains. There is no obvious source to promote complete unfolding of these domains and previous studies have shown that both receptor-binding and pore-forming domains are very stable towards denaturants [46]. Furthermore, colicin A mutants in which disulphide bonds have been engineered between various helices of the pore-forming domain can still be translocated through the outer membrane [36,58]. There are two alternative possibilities: transient destabilization of the porin trimer to create a pore large enough for the pore-forming domain to slip through; or translocation across the outer surface of the trimer. The energy costs required for either pathway could be provided by the toxin binding to the receptor and the translocation domain `switching' on the translocation machinery upon binding to TolA. Hybrids of OmpF, and the related porin OmpC, which bind colicin N but are not active in colicin N uptake, have been used to map the region of OmpF required for translocation [52]. The region was localised on the surface of the porin trimer directly below the loop containing residues 284 and 285, which have been implicated in binding (see above), and largely separated from the pore lumen by an internal long loop (loop L3). These data support passage across the outer surface of the trimer. Presumably, the Tol translocation machinery mediates this passage across the outer membrane.

If, as proposed for colicin A, the receptor-binding domain remains bound to OmpF, we have suggested a model that allows the translocation and the pore-forming domains to translocate to the periplasmic space. It explains the observation that on initial binding to the receptor, the translocation domain of colicin N is prone to proteolysis although it is resistant to proteolysis upon translocation [54]. On initial binding, the translocation domain would be accessible to proteases, whereas upon translocation it would have passed across the membrane. Our current model for colicin toxicity is summarized in Figure 6.

its chymotryptic fragment have been described elsewhere [44]. Crystals of the chymotryptic fragment of colicin N were grown by the hanging drop method at room temperature. The protein concentration was 10 mg/ml and the reservoir solution consisted of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.6­7.0) and 60% (w/v) saturated ammonium sulphate. Small crystals appeared after 1­2 days and grew to their full size of up to 0.6 mm × 0.6 mm × 0.6 mm in 1­2 weeks.

Data collection and processing
The full-length colicin N-derived crystals belong to the space group P4132. A low-resolution data set was collected to 6 Å resolution (Rsym = 8.9% and 97% complete). The crystals obtained from the chymotryptic fragment belong to the cubic spacegroup I4132 with unit cell parameters of a = b = c = 187.3 Å and with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The best native data set (to 3.1 Å resolution) was collected on the X-31 beamline at the Deutsche Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Outstation, Hamburg, Germany. The wavelength was set to 1.009 Å and data were collected using a Hendrix-Lentfer imaging plate scanner. Processing was performed using the CCP4 program suite [61] and the data statistics are presented in Table 1. Diffraction data for the heavy-atom search (Table 1) were collected on a multiwire area detector (Nicolet/Xentronics, Madison, USA) or on a FAST area detector system (Enraf-Nonius, Delft, The Netherlands) using a rotating anode X-ray generator. The data sets were processed using the XDS software suite [62].

Biological implications
Colicins are a distinctive class of antibiotics produced by various strains of Escherichia coli. When induced through the SOS system, they are secreted into the extracellular medium with the aid of a lysis protein. Following secretion, the toxin molecules bind to metabolite receptors on the outer membrane of sensitive cells, thereby parasitizing these bacterial transport systems and using them as entry ports. The translocation across the periplasm is aided by some of the target cell's transport machinery. Subsequent killing of the bacterial cell is achieved by a variety of means, including DNase activity, RNase activity or pore formation. Pore-forming colicins have proved to be powerful model systems for investigating the mechanisms of protein translocation, channel formation and function. Colicin N is the shortest of the known colicins, but still retains all the functionalities of its relations. Because of its relative simplicity, it is an ideal system for studying colicin translocation mechanisms. In addition, the entry route into the target cell used by colicin N is the same as that used by filamentous bacteriophages and hence work on colicin N is also likely to shed light on phage infection. We have solved the crystal structure of a large fragment of colicin N which includes the receptor-binding and pore-forming domains. The pore-forming domain adopts the canonical globin-like fold of other colicin poreforming domains, whereas the receptor-binding domain adopts a novel fold. Based on the structure and the previously determined crystal structure of its receptor, OmpF, it has been possible to produce a plausible model of how colicin N traverses two membranes to form a voltagegated ion channel.

Preparation of heavy-atom derivatives and Patterson search
Attempts to solve the colicin N structure by molecular replacement methods using the crystal structure of the colicin A pore-forming domain as a model failed. No solution for the translation function could be found, even though the rotation function showed significant peaks. For the heavy-atom derivative searches, crystals were transferred to a synthetic mother liquor containing 70% ammonium sulphate and 60 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.4 or 70% ammonium sulphate and 50 mM acetate buffer pH 5.6. Various heavy-atom reagents were added in concentrations of 2­30 mM and the crystals were soaked in these solutions for 1­8 days (Table 1). More than 40 different reagents were tested. The best heavy-atom derivative was obtained by soaking crystals for 2 days in saturated K2PtI6. This was the first derivative solved using the program GROPAT [63]. The correct solution was the third best solution in the ranked program output. Because this derivative had a significant anomalous signal, other derivative sites could be located via difference Fourier calculations using the (at that time apparently single) Pt site. At this stage, five derivatives turned out to be useful for the initial phasing (Table 1). The first MIR map was calculated with an initial figure-of-merit of 0.8 for 3,180 reflections (20­4.5 Å). In the initial map, the  helices of the pore-forming domain were already visible as thick rods. In the course of the refinement, more heavy atom sites were successively included. In

Materials and methods
Protein purification and crystallization
Purification of colicin N was carried out as previously described [60]. Initial crystals were obtained from full-length colicin N. These crystals were grown by the hanging drop method at room temperature using reservoir conditions of 50 mM phosphate pH 7.0, 40% (w/v) ammonium sulphate and 0­5% PEG 6000. These crystals only diffracted to just beyond 6 Å resolution, however. These crystals took several months to appear and analysis of the crystals showed that a proteolytic cleavage had occurred after residue 36. Attempts were then made to crystallize a proteolytic fragment of the toxin. The production and characterization of

model. This procedure was repeated several times, combining the model phases with the heavy-atom phases in every step using the program SIGMAA [65] so that the danger of model bias was minimized. During this procedure, the electron density of the receptorbinding domain improved considerably, so that density modification methods (e.g. solvent flattening) were not needed. For the first 24 N-terminal amino acids no density was visible, although the density for the rest of the molecule was well-defined and unambiguous. For model refinement, both positional refinement and simulated annealing refinement were applied using X-PLOR [66]. The final crystallographic R-factor after refinement with X-PLOR was 19.9% (for 9,099 reflections > 2 sigma, 6.0-3.1 Å). The final refinement was performed using the program TNT [67] with all the data from 23 Å to 3.1 Å, containing 10,966 unique reflections. The temperature factors were refined with correlation restraints because of the insufficient resolution of the data. The crystallographic R-factor after the TNT refinement was 17.3%, the free R-factor was 31.6% (10% of reflections used for the test set), and the model exhibited excellent geometry (Table 2). The final model includes 59 solvent molecules. The final map is of good quality (Figure 7). All heavy atoms bind to reasonable chemical sites and hence corroborate the structure. The final structure was analysed using PROCHECK [68]. The Ramachandran plot shows that all non-glycine residues fall in either the allowed (92.8%) or additional allowed regions (7.2%). Other stereochemical parameters such as peptide-bond planarity, -carbon tetrahedral distortions and non-bonded interactions are all inside or better than the allowed ranges according to PROCHECK. In addition to the PROCHECK tests, the veracity of the model was assessed using the 3D_1D profile analysis program package [69]. The three-dimensional profile scores were better than 0.3 in all regions of the protein, corroborating the correctness of the model. The final model was used to solve the structure of the full-length-derived colicin N crystals by molecular replacement. After rigid body refinement, the free R-factor was 29.4%. If the data from these crystals were phased only with the poreforming domain, then the free R-factor was only 37.0%, but the density for the secondary structural elements of the receptor-binding domain could clearly be seen. At no stage was there any evidence for density corresponding to the translocation domain, which is in full agreement with circular dichroism results, which show that this domain does not adopt any regular structure [45,46].

*Rcrys = hkl ||Fobs| ­ |Fcalc|| / hkl ||Fobs|, where Fobs denotes the observed structure factor amplitude and Fcalc denotes the structure factor amplitude calculated from the model. 10% of reflections were used to calculate Rfree. the end, it turned out that 21 of the tested compounds had yielded useful derivatives, although only 18 were used in the final phase calculation. (Only the best five derivatives are shown in Table 1 because the others only made a marginal contribution to the phasing). In total, there were 38 sites of which 19 were different.

Structure refinement
In the first step of the model building, the pore-forming domain of colicin N was modelled using the structure of the homologous colicin A domain [41] as a starting structure. This was helpful in speeding up the refinement process because the electron density maps calculated from the MIR phases were not readily interpretable. Modelling was performed using the program O [64]. The phases resulting from this initial model were combined with the heavy-atom phases and an improved map was calculated, followed by an adjustment of the
