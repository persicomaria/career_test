The ubiquitin ligase complex SCFFbs1, which contributes to the ubiquitination of glycoproteins, is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. In SCF ubiquitin ligases, a diverse array of F-box proteins confers substrate specificity. Fbs1/Fbx2, a member of the F-box protein family, recognizes high-mannose oligosaccharides. To elucidate the structural basis of SCFFbs1 function, we determined the crystal structures of the Skp1­Fbs1 complex and the sugar-binding domain (SBD) of the Fbs1­ glycoprotein complex. The mechanistic model indicated by the structures appears to be well conserved among the SCF ubiquitin ligases. The structure of the SBD­ glycoprotein complex indicates that the SBD primarily recognizes Man3GlcNAc2, thereby explaining the broad activity of the enzyme against various glycoproteins. Comparison of two crystal structures of the Skp1­Fbs1 complex revealed the relative motion of a linker segment between the F-box and the SBD domains, which might underlie the ability of the complex to recognize different acceptor lysine residues for ubiquitination.

biquitin-mediated proteolysis plays a regulatory role in a number of diverse cellular processes and involves the selective destruction of short-lived functional proteins (1). The ubiquitin­proteasome system also is responsible for the disposal of misfolded and unfolded cellular proteins, the aberrant accumulation of which usually causes cell death, which can lead to neurodegenerative diseases (2). Protein ubiquitination is catalyzed by a sophisticated cascade system consisting of the ubiquitin-activating (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2), and ubiquitinligating (E3) enzymes (3). Among these enzymes, the E3 enzymes are responsible for the selection of target proteins. E3 enzymes are a diverse family of proteins and protein complexes. One of the best characterized groups of E3 enzymes is the SCF complex [composed of Skp1, Cul1, Rbx1 (also called Roc1), and an F-box protein], which regulates the degradation of a broad range of cellular proteins (4). F-box proteins consist of an N-terminal 40-aa F-box domain that binds to Skp1 and various C-terminal substrate-recognition regions and are subcategorized into three classes according to their substrate-binding domains. The Fbw (or FBXW) and Fbl (or FBXL) families possess WD40 repeats and leucine-rich repeats in their binding domains, respectively (5). The third class of F-box proteins is the Fbx (or FBXO) family, which does not contain any presumptive functional domains. However, we recently identified a subfamily within the Fbx family that consists of at least five homologous F-box proteins that recognize N-glycan; we named the sugarbinding domain (SBD)-containing proteins of this subfamily the Fbs (F-box protein that recognizes sugar chains; known previously as FBG) proteins (6). In the SCF complex, Cul1 functions as a molecular scaffold that simultaneously interacts through its N and C termini with the crucial adaptor subunits Skp1 and Rbx1 together with a specific E2 enzyme, respectively. Skp1 is an adaptor protein that

links Cul1 and one of the F-box proteins (6). Fbw and Fbl proteins usually recognize the phosphorylation status of the substrate, and structural models of the SCF complexes of some of these proteins, such as Fbw1/ -TrCP1 (7), Fbw7/Cdc4 (8), and Fbl1/Skp2 (9­11), have been reported. Structural information, however, is available only for the recognition of phosphorylated protein substrates. N-linked glycosylation of proteins takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a key role in protein quality control (12). Misfolded proteins and unassembled protein complexes that fail to assume their functional states in the endoplasmic reticulum are subjected to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, which involves retrotranslocation into the cytosol and degradation by the ubiquitin­proteasome system. SCFFbs1 is an N-linked glycoprotein-specific ubiquitin ligase complex that contains the neuron-specific F-box protein Fbs1/Fbx2/NFB42 (13­16). We previously reported x-ray crystal structures of the Fbs1 SBD alone and in complex with di-N-acetylchitobiose (chitobiose, GlcNAc-GlcNAc, or GlcNAc2), which revealed that the binding site is formed by a small hydrophobic pocket located at the top of a -sandwich (17).

underlying the ubiquitination of N-glycoproteins by the SCFFbs1 ubiquitin ligase, however, is unknown at present. To understand the mechanistic details of the SCFFbs1-mediated ubiquitination reaction, we determined the crystal structures of the SBD­ glycoprotein and Skp1­Fbs1 complexes. Results
Overall Structure of the Skp1­Fbs1 Complex. The Skp1­Fbs1 com-

Fbs1. Fbs1 consists of four distinct domains: the PEST domain (residues 1­54), the F-box domain (residues 55­95), a linker domain (residues 96­124), and the SBD (residues 125­297). The electron densities of the N-terminal PEST domain (residues 1­47) and part of the linker domain (residues 104­108) are not visible, suggesting that these regions are flexible. Although the Skp1­Fbs1 complex was crystallized in the presence of 30 mM chitobiose, the chitobiose molecule is not visible in this structure. The F-box domain comprises four helices, which is the same structural motif observed in the Skp1-binding domains of Skp2 and -TrCP1 (Fig. 2A). The SBD in the Skp1­Fbs1 complex is composed of a 10-stranded antiparallel -sandwich, and it can be superposed on the previously reported structure of SBD alone with an average rms deviation of 0.39 Å for the C atoms, indicating that the structures are very similar. On the other hand, the C-terminal linker helix 5 assumes slightly different positions in the two structures because of crystal packing and the flexibility of the linker domain, which consists of 5 and a loop structure. The Skp1 in the Skp1­Fbs1 complex adopts the same BTB/ POZ fold (18) observed in previously reported structures of Skp1 (7­9). Interestingly, the C-terminal -helix 8 of previously reported structures of Skp1 complexed with other F-box proteins is replaced with an extended structure (C loop: residues 146­ 155) (Fig. 2 A). The differences in the secondary structure of Skp1 may reflect different roles of the protein. With the exception of the C-terminal loop, the overall structure of Skp1 is almost identical to those of the protein in the Skp1­Skp2 and Skp1­ -TrCP1 complexes (rms deviations for the C atoms: 1.8 and 2.1 Å, respectively).

The E2 active-site cysteine and acceptor lysine residues are depicted with circled letters.

Skp2 (1.5-Å rms deviation for 27 C atoms) and -TrCP1 (1.7-Å rms deviation for 28 C atoms), there are several differences. Helix 2 in Fbs1 is composed of two segments ( 2 and 2 ) separated by a turn, which causes it to bulge into the C loop of Skp1. The orientations of helices 3 and 4 of Fbs1 are similar to those of Skp2 but not to those of -TrCP1 (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, whereas the C-terminal region of the F-box domain of Skp2 is a loop structure, those of Fbs1 and -TrCP1 form -helices ( 4). The binding mode between Skp1 and the F-box domain of Fbs1 is almost identical to those between Skp1 and Skp2 (1.0-Å rms deviation for 120 C atoms) and between Skp1 and -TrCP1 (1.1-Å rms deviation for 117 C atoms), except that the C loop of Skp1 interacts with the F-box domain through van der Waals contacts (Phe-145, Glu-149, Glu-150, Ala-151, Gln-152, and Val-153 of Skp1 interact with Val-72, Gln-73, Arg-76, Leu-77, and Leu-80 of Fbs1) (Fig. 2B). The positions of the Fbs1 F-box domain and 7 in Skp1 are shifted away from the N-terminal domain of Skp1 by 4.0 Å (Skp1­Skp2) or 2.5 Å (Skp1­ -TrCP1). These differences in the distances from the F-box domains to 7 of Skp1 and the C-terminal structures of Skp1 are likely due to the F-box structure.

oligosaccharide (Man6 ­ 8GlcNAc2) attached at Asn-34 (19). RNaseB binds to the edge of the -sandwich of the SBD (Fig. 3A). Clear electron density demonstrates the presence of Man3GlcNAc2 bound to the Fbs1 monomer, but the outer branches of the carbohydrate are disordered and not visible in the electron density map. The structure of the Fbs1-bound RNaseB, which consists of three -helices and seven -strands, is essentially identical to the previously reported structures of apo-RNaseB (20, 21); these structures have an average 0.59-Å rms deviation for the C positions. Similarly, the SBDs in the structures of the Skp1­Fbs1 and SBD­RNaseB complexes can be superposed with an average 0.48-Å rms deviation for the C positions, indicating that RNaseB binding does not cause any significant structural changes in the SBD.

The sugar-binding surface consists of the four loops between 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and 9 and 10. Man3GlcNAc2 interacts with nine Fbs1 residues (Asp-158, Asn-159, Phe-177, Arg-214, Asp-216, Tyr-279, Trp-280, Lys-281, and Phe-284) through hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals contacts (Fig. 3 B and C). The molecular recognition mechanism between the chitobiose moiety and the amino acid residues in Fbs1 is similar to that reported previously for the SBD­chitobiose complex (17). The methyl group of the N-acetyl moiety from the GlcNAc (I) residue is inserted into a small hydrophobic pocket surrounded by the side chains of Phe-177, Tyr-279, and Lys-281; and the O3 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain N atom of Lys-281. The GlcNAc (II) residue is stacked on the aromatic ring of Trp-280 and the O6 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Lys-281. The two GlcNAc residues form an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the O3 atom of GlcNAc (I) and the O6 atom of GlcNAc (II). Formation of these hydrogen bonds fixes the orientation of the (134)-linked GlcNAc residues. Comparison of the SBD­RNaseB complex and the previously reported SBD­chitobiose complex reveals that the substrate binding pockets (Phe-177, Tyr-279, Trp-280, and Lys-281) and the chitobiose structures can be superposed with an average rms deviation of 0.69 Å for all of the atoms (Fig. 3D). Only the side chain of Lys-281 has a different conformation, and it has been shown that Lys-281 is not essential for the binding to chitobiose (17). The outer mannose-binding residues of the SBD also do not exhibit significant conformational changes. We have reported that Fbs1 recognizes not only chitobiose but also the outer mannose branches (17). The O4 atom of Man(III)

forms a hydrogen bond with the sidechain O atom of the Asp-216 sidechain; this hydrogen bond stabilizes the complex with the Man (134)GlcNAc2 moiety. Clear electron density is observed between the (134)-linked Man residue and Asp-216 in Fbs1. Furthermore, Asp-216 is conserved in other F-box proteins that contain an F-box-associated domain, suggesting that it plays a role in the recognition of oligosaccharides. Man(IV) forms hydrogen bonds with the sidechain N atom of Asn-159 through the O2 atom and with the sidechain N atom of Arg-214 through the O5 atom. On the other hand, Man(V) protrudes from the binding site and does not interact with Fbs1. These results indicate that the GlcNAc2 core, (134)-linked Man(III), and (133)-linked Man(IV) play significant roles in the binding to Fbs1. Whereas Man8GlcNAc2 is thought to be the major N-glycan among unfolded glycoproteins that are translocated into the cytosol for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, our results indicate that Man3GlcNAc2 can be sufficiently recognized by the SCFFbs1 complex. Indeed, various synthetic oligosaccharides were used to show that Man3GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 have similar affinities for Fbs1 (22). On the other hand, the binding affinities of Man8GlcNAc1 and chitobiose for Fbs1 are several orders of magnitude lower than those of Man 3 GlcNAc 2 and Man 8 GlcNAc 2 , indicating that Man3GlcNAc2 is required for efficient binding to Fbs1 (15, 22). Moreover, the binding site provides substrate selectivity and specificity based on its shape and hydrogen-bonding network. There are limited contacts between the SBD and RNaseB; the interface involves only 514 Å2 of surface-accessible area. The surface areas occupied by Man3GlcNAc2 and the protein portion of the substrate are 349 and 165 Å2, respectively. In addition to the smaller contact area, the protein portion of RNaseB does not form a hydrogen bond with Fbs1, suggesting that Man3GlcNAc2, but not the protein in RNaseB, defines the interaction with Fbs1.
Linker Flexibility Might Accommodate a Range of Substrates. Two crystal forms were identified for Skp1­Fbs1 (P3221 and P212121 define form 1 and form 2, respectively). These two forms have essentially the same overall structure (rms deviation of 1.1 Å for the C atoms) (Fig. 4A). Whereas the Skp1 proteins are well aligned with each other, the SBD of Fbs1 in form 2 is tilted farther away from Skp1 by 3°. The 3° tilt angle of the SBD creates a 3-Å gap at the substrate-binding site and a 6-Å shift at the E2 active site. This flexibility seems to be due in part to the
5780 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0610312104

linker-domain structure of Fbs1 (Fig. 4A). Residues 100­103 and 113­115 are shifted significantly compared with form 1. Although the linkage between the F-box and WD40 domains does not seem to be exceedingly rigid in the yeast Cdc4 structure, deletion of helix 5 or the lengthening of helix 6 due to an insertion of amino acid residues disrupts Cdc4 function in vivo, suggesting that the orientation and rigidity of the linkage between the F-box and the substrate-binding domains is important for SCF function (8). In the structure of Fbs1, the interaction between 5 and the linker loop through van der Waals contacts (His-113 of the linker loop to Gln-115, Phe-119, and Arg-123 of 5) is not rigid, and residues 104­108 of the linker domain are not visible in the electron density map. This structure indicates that the linkage between the F-box domain and the SBD of Fbs1 is somewhat flexible. This feature might allow the protein to accommodate a range of substrates (Fig. 4B). Discussion In this study, we determined the crystal structures of two crystal forms of the Skp1­Fbs1 complex and the SBD­RNaseB complex at 2.4-, 3.5-, and 2.7-Å resolutions, respectively. The structure of the Skp1­Fbs1 complex illustrates a different class of F-box proteins within the SCF ubiquitin ligase model. A model of the SCFFbs1­RNaseB­E2 complex was generated simply by superposition of the Skp1 subunits from the Skp1­Fbs1 and Skp1­ Cul1­Rbx1 structures (PDB ID code 1LDK), the RING-finger domains derived from Rbx1 and from the c-Cbl subunit of the c-Cbl-UbcH7 structure (PDB ID code 1FBV) (23), the E2 subunits of the c-Cbl-UbcH7 structure, and the SBD-RNaseB structure. In this SCFFbs1-RNaseB model, RNaseB points toward the E2-binding site on Rbx1 (Fig. 5). The distance between the E2 active-site cysteine and the substrate-binding site is 60 Å, which is similar to the value that was reported previously (7, 8, 10). Despite differences in the sizes of the substrates and the positions of ubiquitinated lysine residues, the distance between the E2 active-site cysteine and the substrate-binding site is conserved among the SCF complexes. The same mechanism that allows the E2 active-site cysteine to reach the ubiquitinated lysine residues of the substrates is used independently of the type of F-box protein. In the case of RNaseB, the distances between the E2 activesite cysteine and the lysine residues in RNaseB are 58.6­88.4 Å in the model of the SCFFbs1­RNaseB­E2 complex, whereas the

lysine residues in RNaseB are between 5.3 and 36.9 Å away from Asn-34. RNaseB is smaller than the minimum distance required to reach E2. Actually, SCFFbs1 was not able to ubiquitinate RNaseB in vitro. This could be because RNaseB is too small, the lysine residues are at the wrong positions, or RNaseB is fixed because of contacts between Man3GlcNAc2 and Fbs1. One of the most important properties for ubiquitination is the rigidity of the SCF­ ubiquitin­ligase complex structure, because it serves to correctly position the target protein and E2. The two crystal structures of the Skp1­Fbs1 complex described in the present study, however, show differences in the orientation of the SBD. We propose that SCFFbs1 has the ability to nonspecifically ubiquitinate glycoproteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. The protein portion of a target glycoprotein bound to Fbs1 may rotate at the linkage site between the innermost GlcNAc moiety and the asparagine residue, and the acceptor lysine residue can be located at a variety of positions. In SCFFbs1, the relative motion of the linker domain between the F-box domain and the SBD might be necessary to accommodate the different positions of the acceptor lysine residues in the various endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation substrates. SCFFbs1 is a functionally unique molecule that recognizes the innermost Man3GlcNAc2 in N-glycans as a marker of denatured proteins. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for the recognition and ubiquitination of various glycoproteins by SCFFbs1. Materials and Methods
Protein Expression and Purification. The Skp1­Fbs1 complex was

vapor diffusion method. Skp1­Fbs1 crystals were grown from 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.7), and 30 mM chitobiose, which produced two crystal forms. The SBD­ RNaseB crystals were prepared by using 2.0% (vol/vol) PEG 400, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.5), and 2.1 M ammonium sulfate. Diffraction data sets for Skp1­Fbs1 and SBD­RNaseB were collected at beamline BL44XU (SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan). Data processing and reduction were carried out with the HKL program suite (24). The two crystal forms of Skp1­Fbs1 and the SBD­RNaseB crystals belong to the P3221 (Skp1­Fbs1 form 1), P212121 (Skp1­Fbs1 form 2), and P432 (SBD­RNaseB) space groups. Heavy-atom soaks of the Skp1­Fbs1 crystals (form 1) were performed in crystallization buffer with 1 mM thimerosal for 5 min. Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
Structure Determination and Refinement. The structure of Skp1­ Fbs1 was determined by a combination of molecular replacement, single isomorphous replacement, and anomalous scattering with an Hg derivative. The initial single isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering phases were calculated with SHARP (25) and then improved by density modification with DM (26). Molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (27) was used to locate the Skp1 and SBD portions of the complex with search models consisting of Skp1 from SCF (PDB ID code 1LDK) and the SBD of Fbs1 (PDB ID code 1UMH). The model was further built with the program COOT (28) and then was improved by several cycles of manual rebuilding and refinement with the program REFMAC5 (29). The structure of crystal form 2 was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP with the refined model of form 1. The structure of SBD­RNaseB was determined by using the molecular replacement technique, MOLREP, and the structures of the SBD and RNaseB. The refined model contains residues 123­297 of the SBD and residues 1­124 of RNaseB. Phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. There are no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Structure figures were generated by using MOLSCRIPT (30), RASTER3D (31), and CCP4MG (32).

The Skp1­Fbs1 complex was then concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration in 25 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM DTT. For the SBD­RNaseB complex (with SBD residues 105­297 of Fbs1), the SBD and RNaseB (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio and purified by gel-filtration chromatography. Fractions containing the SBD­RNaseB complex were then concentrated to 10 mg/ml and used for crystallization.
Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystals of Skp1­Fbs1 and

SBD­RNaseB were obtained at 20°C by using the sitting-drop
