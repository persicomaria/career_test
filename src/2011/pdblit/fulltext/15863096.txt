Abstract
Molecular recognition and protein-protein electron transfer reactions were studied in a model system in which two ~ l y different proteins (cytochrome c6 and plastocyanin) are used alternatively to accomplish the same redox event, i.e. reduction of the photo-oxidized chlorophyll molecule F'/00 ~ in photosystem i (PSI). Laser flash photolysis kinetic analyses were carried out to obtain aa understanding, from a structural and functional point of view. of how this interchange ability is accomplished, as well as to ot~in increased insight into the electron transfer mechanisms. Our experimental data indicate that the mechanism of reaction of both the cc~perand heme-proteins with PSI is similar within the same organism, but different from one organism to am3ther, thereby s u ~ convergent evolution of the two donor proteins. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A,

I. Introduction Redox reactions are important in a wide variety of key biological processes and generally occur within proteinprotein complexes, in which the active centers (berne, flavin, iron-sulfur, copper, etc.) communicate either directly through orbital overlap, or indirectly by way of ligands or amino acid side chains. Elucidation of the structural factors that determine molecular recognition and interprotein electron transfer is thus a primary goal of modern protein chemistry. Within the electron-transport chain of organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis, the electron transfer pathway from the cytoehrome btf complex to photosystern I (PSI) - - which are both protein complexes embedded in the thylakoidal membrane - - is mediated by two soluble redox prot~ins, either by the type I copper-protein plastocyanin (Pc) in higher plants or by the heine-protein cytochrome c o (Cyt) in a number of cyanobacterial species

(see Ref. [!] for a recent review). Other cyanobacterial and algal species are able to synthesize either Cyt ~ Pc, depending on the availability of copper in the c~ture medium [2,3]. The two metallopr~eins are acidic in green algae, as is Pc in higher plants, but both can be either basic or acidic in cyanobacteria (see below). The Cyt and Pc couple is thus a typical analogous system in which two biological structures have the same function but different evolutionary origin. In consequence, Cyt and Pc are suitable for investigation of the convergent evolution of proteins at the molecular level by determining the c o ~ structural features that allow these two metalloproteins to play the same physiological role. A great deal of structural information exists for Pc from eukaryotic organisms (see Ref. [4] for a review). From this collection of data, the existence of two probable dec~,on transfer sites in Pc has been inferred: one is the so-called hydrophobic patch around His87 (a copper-coordina~ng residue on the 'north' pole of the protein), which could act as the active site for redox interaction with PSI [5]; the other is referred to as the acidic patch around Tyr83 on the 'east' face of the pr~ein, which could act as the entry port of electrons coming from cytochrome f [6]. I~ contrast, the crystal structure of Cyt has been solved onl./recently. Actually, the two Cyt X-ray structures now available correspond to the hen,e-protein from the green algae Chlamy-

domonas reinhardtii [7] and Monoraphidiura braunii [8,9], which were both solved in 1995. Our comparative analysis of the structures of Cyt and Pc from eukaryotie organisms suggests that the heine-protein molecule contains just one active site for electron transfer, which is used for interaction with both cytochrome f and PSI, whereas the copperprotein molecule could react with its redox partners in two different areas [8]. This paper summarizes our most recent data on the mechanism of PSI reduction by Cyt and Pc from several sources as studied by laser flash photolysis. The experimental data are diseussed in the light of different working kinetic models depending on the organism from which the donor protein/PSI systems are obtained. Flavins were used firstly as a probe to investigate the nature of the redox active sites in these two metalloproteins.

Data from Navarroet al. [13,15]and Tollin et al. [17I. closely adjacent) sites are used for electron entry and removal in the two proteins [13,15]. In the particular case of FMN-catalyzed redox reactions, the oxidation and reduction rate constants are dependent on ionic strength with the proteins from spinach, Anabaen,~ and Monoraphidium, whereas the reactivity of Synechocystis Cyt and Pc remains unaffected at different salt concentrations. In agreement with the net charge of each protein, the rate constant increases with increasing ionic strength in spinach and Monoraphidium, and decreases as the ionic strength increases in Anabaena [15]. By fitting the experimental data with FMN at varying salt concentrations to the formalism described by Watkins et al. [16], it is possible to obtain values for the second-order rate constant extrapolated to infinite ionic strength k~, i.e. the intrinsic rate constant of the redox reaction, and estimate the electrostatic interaction energy between the reactants V~i and the net charge at the site of electron transfer in the protein Z~. The values of all these theoretical estimations are listed in Table I. As can be seen, the active sites appear to be positively charged in Anabaena Cyt and Pc, and negatively charged in the two proteins from Monoraphidium and in spinach Pc, in good agreement with the isoelectric point of all these proteins (see above). When the data for FMN-sensitized oxidation and reduction of these metalloproteins are competed, significant differences are observed enly with Anabaena Pc: the electrostatic parameters Vii and Z z yield values of -0.3 and +0.5 respectively for Pc oxidation, and -1.8 and +2.4 for Pc reduction (Table 1). In addition, a relatively low value of k~ (compared with the second-order rate constant with lumiflavin and riboflavin) is obtained for oxidation and reduction of Anabaena Pc [15]. Thus, both the electrostatic and steric effects suggest that Anabaena Pc oxidation and reduction by FMN may occur at different sites: oxidation at the hydrophobic patch (with no net charge), and reduction at the hydrophiiic patch (positively charged in Anabaena).

'_ Flavin-protein interactions Havin laser flash absorption spectroscopy has been used to study the reaction meciaamsms of both o~.idation and reduction in redox proteins (see Refs. [10,11] for reviews). By exciting free flavins with a short laser pulse it is possible to populate with high yield the flavin triplet sta~e which is a strong oxidant and can oxidize the reduced form of a redox protein. Alternatively, the ravin triplet state can oxidize a non-proteinic donor (i.e. EDTA) to generate the flavosemiquinone radical, which is a strong reductant and can reduce the oxidized form of a redox protein [12,13]. In addition, the particular side chain of flavins varies. In consequence, we can use ravin molecules bearing sterically or electrostatically different functional groups either in oxidative or in reductive experiments, which can thus supply relevant information regarding the steric accessibility and the electrostatic character of the redox center at the protein surface. We used flavin laser flash photolysis to investigate the kinetics of oxidation and reduction of Cyt and Pc from a number of evolutionarily differentiated organisms, namely, cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, green algae such as Monoraphidium braunii, and higher plants such as spinach. Taking into account the electrostatic nature of the interaction of Cyt and Pc with PSI, these organisms were also chosen considering the different isoelectric points of their respective metalloproteins: 4.2 in spinach Pc; 3.6-3.75 in Monoraphidium Cyt and Pc; 5.6 in Synechocystis Cyt and Pc; close to 9 in Anabaena Cyt and Pc [14]. Lumiflavin and riboflavin were used as photosensitizers with no electrical charge but bearing sterically different side chains, and flavin-mononucleotide (FMN) was employed as a negatively charged reactant. With only one exception [see below), similar stcnc and electrostatic effects were observed for both oxidation and reduction of Cyt and Pc, thus suggesting that the same (or

As a general conclusion, we can say that the flavin kinetic studies suggest that there are considerable quantitative similarities between Cyt and Pc when isolated from the same organism, in good agreement with the identical physiological role of these two proteins.

3, Kinetics of PSI reduction The interaction between Pc and PSI has been extensively studied in a wide variety of organisms. The electrostatic nature of the process, the specific role played by divalent cations and the effect of pH have been clearly shown [18-21]. In order to gain more insight into the mechanism of electron transfer from Cyt and Pc to PSI, we carried out a number of comparative laser flash absorption spectroscopy studies. The reduction of spinach PSI either by spinach Pc or by Monoraphidium Cyt and PC follows a biphasic [ii~etic, which can be well fitted to a double exponential curve [14]. Biphasic kinetics is also observed when Anabaena PSI is reduced by Cyt from the same organism. In all these cases, the amplitude of the first fast phase increases with

increasing donor protein cot~centration, whereas its halftime fi/2 is i ~ n t of the con~mtration d Cyt or Pc [14], The observed pseudo first-order rate c o m ~ ko~ d the slower phase in these biphasi¢ kinetic traces, the kn of the monophasic kinetics observed in A#abaena Pc/PSL and the kobs obtained with S~echocystis Cyt/P$1 and Pc/PSI, increases with increasing donor protein cmmemmtion (Fig. 1). These rate constants can exhibit ~ a linear protein concentration dependence, as is the case Synechocystis and anabaena, or a n~linear dependence with a maximum value at saturating protein c o n c ~ as occurs when spinach PSI is being reduced by Monoraphidium proteins (Fig. 1). The effect of electrostatic interactions on PSi was also investigated by determining the observed pse~,,dofirst-order rate constant of the dower component of PSi m d a c t ~ (in fact,the only comlxamnt in the monof~.,&sic ~ ) at varying NaCi concentrations. Fig. I shows that the effect of ionic strength on the reaction rate const~'tts varies in the different ptmein/PSI systems under study. Actually, the observed rate constant decreases with increasing salt co~ cenm~don in Anabaena, increases to reach a iflama in Synechocystis, and exhibits a biphasic depemlence in spinach; in the latter case the k ~ fast increases with increasing ionic strength, reacbes a maximum valt~, and decreases at higher salt concentrations (Fig. !). All these findings suggest that the role played by electrmta~ ing'ractions in the, reaction mechanism may vary from one organism to another.

4. Prooosed modds for tim mechanism of PSI redmtioa The comparative kinetic analysis we carried out using a number of evolutionarily differentiated organisms (see above) has allowed us to infer interesting conclusions on the mechanism of electron transfer to PSI. Three different kinetic models have been proposed [14,23]. The simplest and least efficient model is an oriented collision reaction mechanism, in which the electron transfer from Cyt or Pc to PSI takes place just after a long-range force ddven collision - - the rote constant is so high compared with lifetime of the transient complex that it is not kineticalty measurable (type I). The kinetic behavior of the protein/psi systems following this type of n'ec~nism i~ monophasic (with no fast phase) and exhibits a linear dependence of k ~ on donor protein concencafion. A similar kinetic behavior could be expected in the case that electron transfer were the rate-limiting step and translem complex dissociation were much faster than complex assoc~.~)ion;however, this does not atvear to be the case as the interactions between reaction pmtners are electmstatically attractive in the organisms exhibiting such a type I reaction mechanism. The fact that there is no formation of a stable intermediate complex before triggering the laser flash makes the kinetics of PT00+ reduction monophasic with a

ra~ constant corresponding to that at which the metalloprotein collides with PSI. A more evolved model corresponds to a minimal twostep rneehanism involving complex formation followed by intmcomplex electron transfer (type II). In this second case, the kinetics of PSI reduction appears to be monophasic, but the dependence of k,~ on donor protein concentralion is non-linear and reaches a maximum value at saturating concentrations. This reaction mechanism involves the formation of a kinetically stable transient complex in which electron transfer is rather slow. The rate of P700 + reduction is thus a function of the amount of intermediate protein/PSI complex, which in torn depends on the coneontration of Cyt or Pc. In other words, the rate of P700 + reduction is that of the electron transfer step at saturating concentrations of Cyt or Pc as all the PSI centers are assnciated with a donor protein molecule. The maximum efficiency in electron transfer to PSI would correspond to the third model, which involves rearrangement of the reaction partners within the transient complex before electron transfer takes place (type III). The protein/PSI systems following this type of mechanism show biphasic kinetics, with a sharp fast phase and kob~ values for the slower phase with a non-linear protein concentration dependence (see Section 3). The first, fast kinetic phase corresponds to electron transfer inside the protein/PSI complex formed prior to flash, the amount of which depends on the total donor protein concentration. Hence, the amplitude of the fast phase - - but not its rate constant - - depends on the initial concentration of Cyt or Pc. If there were no complex rearrangement before eteclxon trat~sfer, as is the case in the type 11 mechanism, the rate constant of the fast phase should correspond to the limiting rate of the slower phase at infinite donor protein concentration. We have mus assumed that the fast phase in the type III reaction mechanism corresponds to the well arranged complexes (with redox centers properly oriented) that already exist before the laser flash, whereas the second, slower phase at saturating donor protein concentration should correspond not to the electron transfer but to the reorganization step. Actually, the rearrangement step should appear as an intermediate kinetic phase under certain conditions, namely at low donor protein concentrations; its absence from the experimental oscilloscope traces can be easily explained by assuming that complex rearra,~;ement is the rate.limiting step. A picture of the different steps of the type III reaction mechanism is shown in Scheme 1. The first step corresponds to the attractive electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged proteins - - in eukaryotic organisms, the donor proteins Cyt and Pc have a net negative charge (see above) and PSI possesses a positively charged binding protein, that is the psaF subunit; in some cyanobaeteria, such as Anabaena, the electrostatic charges of the donor proteins and psaF would be quite the reverse [24], but the net interaction between them still remains attractive.

second step involves the formation of a stabilized electrostatic complex that allows the redox centers of both parthers to interact with each other. The third step requires rearrangement of the reaction partners within the transient complex in order to optimize the relative orientation of the redox centers before electron transfer takes place; such a rearrangement probably involves structural modifications in both the donor protein and PSI, as suggested in the scheme. The final step is the electron transfer itself. Table 2 shows the kinetic parameters for the different protein/PSI systems, which were analyzed by fitting the experimental data to the corresponding kinetic model. The reaction mechanism is tentatively assigned to type HI only in the case of MonoraphidiumPc when interacting with PSI from the same organism, as it exhibits a fast kinetic phase (with an amplitude less than 10%) but the kob~ values for the slower phase depend linearly on donor protein concentration [14]. It is interesting to note that the fast phase in Anabaena PSI (t~/2ffi 4 p,s), which is observed only with Cyt and not with Pc, is significantly faster than in any other organism (Table 2). Such findings indicate that PSI was able first to optimize its interaction with positively charged Cyt by means of long-distance attractive monopole-monopole interactions between the positive electron donor protein and negative PSI complexes [14,23]. In addition, Cyt appears to be more efficient than Pc - - mainly concerning the fast kinetic phase - - in photosynthetic organisms synthesizing both Cyt and Pc. When considering altogether the different protein/PSI cross-systems in Table 2, the fast kinetic phase is present in spinach PSI only with Pc from the same organism or the

closely related proteins from the green alga Monoraphidium braunii, but not with cyanobacterial proteins. In a similar way, Anabaena PSI exhibits a clear fast phase only in the presence of Anabaena Cyt. It can thus be concluded that the evolutionary pathway leading to the appearance of the fast kinetic phase, as well as the evolutionary replacement of the ancestral Cyt by Pc, would involve structural modifications in both PSI and the donor proteins. Another important conclusion of this study is that the reaction mechanism of PSI reduction by Cyt or Pc is uther different from one organism to another, but it is very similar within the same organism, thus indicating convergent evolution of the two proteins [14,23]. A recent thermodynamic analysis of electron transfer from Cyt and Pc to PSI has allowed us to infer new features concerning the evolution of the reaction mechanism [23,25]. With the only exception of Cyt and PSI from Anabaena, we have observed an interesting compensation effect between entropy and enthalpy at varying ionic strengths in all the Pc/PSI and Cyt/PSI systems therein analyzed. Stabilization of the intermediate electrostatic complex by means of hydrophobic forces has been proposed to be the reason for such a compensation effect. We have also proposed that short-distance forces appear to enhance their importance in the reaction mechanism throughout evolution, whereas long-range interactions would be predominant in less evolved organisms; or in other words, the more complicated is the reaction mechanism, the more important are the short-range hydropbobic interactions. It is likewise noteworthy that evolution seems to sacrifice a relatively high efficiency in non-specific

Our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in PSI reduction by Cyt and Pc is increasing significantly, both at the structural and functional levels. A key question still remains to be answered: ~ ate the critical protein s~ctural parameters used in mokcu~ recognition and in the electron transfer p~ccss? Our practical approach now includes site-specific m u ~ of surface amino acid residues and kinetic characterizalion of mutant Cyt and Pc from the same source. Acundly, the genes coding for the copper- (petE) and heme-getein (petJ) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 have already been cloned and expp~sed in g coti [26,27]. This procedure yields protein ~ completely identical with those obtained from the cyanobac~ rial cells, thereby confirming that this is an adequate too] to address the comparative study of Cyt and Pc by site-directed mutagenesis. The interaction of the wild and mutam metalloproteins with PSI will provide useful information on the reaction mechanisms, as well as on the role played by a number of specific residues in two different cesses: the binding between the donor and acceptor l~'tnets, that is the placement of the two molecules in~ physical contact,and the actualprocess of electrontransfer from the donor to the acceptor center.
