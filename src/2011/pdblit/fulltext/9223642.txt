ABSTRACT The crystal structure of the DNA heptamer d(GCGCGCG) has been solved at 1.65 A resolution by the molecular replacement method and refined to an R-value of 0.184 for 3598 reflections. The heptamer forms a Z-DNA d(CGCGCG)2 with 5'-overhang G residues instead of an A-DNA d(GCGCGC)2 with 3'-overhang G residues. The overhang G residues from parallel strands of two adjacent duplexes form a trans reverse Hoogsteen G * G basepair that stacks on the six Z-DNA basepairs to produce a pseudocontinuous helix. The reverse Hoogsteen G G basepair is unusual in that the displacement N7(G8) and an enhanced of one G base relative to the other allows them to participate in a bifurcated (G1)N2* 06(G1) hydrogen bond, in addition to the two usual hydrogen bonds. The 5'-overhang G residues are anti (G8)C8-H and C2'-endo while the 3'-terminal G residues are syn and C2'-endo. The conformations of both G residues are different from the syn/C3'-endo for the guanosine in a standard Z-DNA. The two cobalt hexammine ions bind to the phosphate groups in both GpC and CpG steps in Z, and Z,, conformations. The water structure motif is similar to the other Z-DNA structures.

INTRODUCTION More than 20 years ago it was discovered that alternating poly-d(C-G) duplexes could adopt an unusual conformation that was thought to be left-handed (Pohl and Jovin, 1972). Soon afterward single-crystal x-ray crystallography conclusively proved the existence of the left-handed duplex, termed Z-DNA (Wang et al., 1979). Since then there was a search for the biological significance of Z-DNA and its function in vivo. It was shown that the formation of Z-DNA could be induced by negative supercoiling in covalently closed circular DNA (Gruskin and Rich, 1993; Lucomski and Wells, 1994) and by anti-Z-DNA antibodies bound to certain DNA stretches (Pietrasanta et al., 1994). Recently, the discovery of a Z-DNA-binding protein has been announced, implying that Z-DNA may play a role in certain promoter sequences (Zhang et al., 1992). Besides G * C basepairs, A * T (Fujii et al., 1985; Brennan et al., 1986), G * BrU (Brown et al., 1986), G * T (Ho et al., 1985), and C I (Kumar et al., 1992) basepairs have been found in the Z-form. A T basepairs are known to destabilize the ZDNA duplex (Wang et al., 1984) and this might explain why longer stretches of alternating A * T basepairs favor the B-form (Yoon et al., 1988). Aside from the above sequences, a few other oligomers that deviate from the regular d(C-G)n scheme have been found to form the left-handed structures, including the nonalternating hexamer d(CCGCGG) (Malinina et al., 1994) and others, incorporating ribose or arabinose sugar units (Teng et al., 1989). We have been interested in the factors governing the interconversion of left- and right-handed nucleic acid du-

plexes. In this respect, we have so far concentrated on the nature of the 5'-terminal nucleotide (Ban et al., 1996) and base modifications like m5C and Br5C (Tippin and Sundaralingam, unpublished results). While for polymers the identity of the 5'-nucleotide (G or C) is unimportant, short altemating oligomers with a 5'-purine start crystallize as A-DNA (Jain et al., 1987; Bingman et al., 1992; Mooers et al., 1995) as found in solution (Quadrifoglio et al., 1984). Interestingly, it seems that the tendency of the 5'-purine start can be partially overcome by increasing the length of the altemating GC step to 10 nucleotides (Ban et al., 1996). It is known that methylation of C-residues at position 5 confers additional stability on the Z-conformation (Fujii et al., 1982). Therefore, it came as a surprise that the Z-DNA decamer d(GC)5 (Ban et al., 1996) converted to the A-form upon methylation of one or several C's (Tippin and Sundaralingam, unpublished results). Apparently there is only a narrow energetic margin that transfonns A- to Z-DNA, and vice versa. To further investigate the relative stability of the A-, B-, and Z-forms, we were interested in selecting a nucleic acid molecule that can form either a right- or left-handed structure with a 3'- or 5'-overhang, respectively. The self-complementary heptamer d(GCGCGCG) was therefore designed for these conformational studies. The central duplex portion of the molecule can contain six alternating deoxynuleotides starting with either a purine that may adopt the right-handed A- (Jain et al., 1987; Bingman et al., 1992; Mooers et al., 1995) or B-form DNA (Cruse et al., 1986) (Scheme 1), or a pyrimidine that may adopt the left-handed Z-form DNA (Wang et al., 1979) (Scheme 2).

This represents the first study of a DNA sequence that can intrinsically have three different conformations (A-, B-, or Z-form). In this paper we will describe the outcome of this conformational competition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis, crystallization, and data collection
The DNA heptamer d(GCGCGCG) was synthesized by the phosphoramidite method using an in-house Applied Biosystem DNA synthesizer 381 (Foster City, CA). The DNA was cleaved from the solid support using 5 ml ammonium hydroxide (30% NH3 in water) and was deprotected in the same solution at 55°C overnight. The extract was lyophilized and then precipitated using 100% ethanol in the presence of 2.5 M ammonium acetate at -250C. The preparation was cycled through ethanol precipitation and lyophilization until white fluffy material was obtained, which dissolved readily in water. A stock solution of 2 mM single-stranded heptamer was prepared in distilled water and used for crystallization without further purification. The crystallization was carried out by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The best crystals were obtained with 1 mM DNA (single-stranded concentration), in the presence of 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), and 0.5 mM spermine tetrachloride, equilibrated against a reservoir of 0.2 ml of 10% 2-propanol. Crystals appeared after one day and continued to grow for about a week; the crystals were light amber in color. A crystal with dimensions 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm x 0.3 mm was mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary tube with some mother liquor at one end, and the capillary sealed with wax. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P2,2121 with unit cell constants a = 20.41 A, b = 29.65 A, and c = 51.86 A and with one duplex in the asymmetric unit. The intensity data were collected at room temperature using our R-axis HIc imaging plate and graphite monochromated CuKa x-ray beam. The crystal-to-detector distance was 65 mm. Thirty-five frames with a framewidth of 20 and an exposure time of 20 min per frame yielded 9304 reflections with 3813 independent reflections up to 1.65 A resolution [F2/or(F2) > 5.0] with an Rmerge of 6.6% and 92.3% completeness. The frames were processed using the data processing software for Rigaku R-axis lIc.

FIGURE 1 The (Fo-Fc) electron density map showing the reverse Hoogsteen G * G basepair between the 5'-overhang residues.

Further positional and B-factor refinement dropped the R-value to 27.8%. The difference (Fobs-Fcal) map showed two octahedral clusters of density (>13o-) which were interpreted as cobalt hexammine ions. Including the two cobalt hexammine ions in further refinement lowered the R-value to 24.0%. Water molecules were included that had nearly spherical densities (>3o-) in the difference (Fobs-FCal) map. In the first round, 34 water molecules were located and included in the refinement, dropping the R-value to 20.4%. Using the next difference (F,b.-Fc.1) map an additional 23 water molecules could be located, and further refinement lowered the final R-value to 18.4%. Although spermine was used in the crystallization trials, no ordered polyamine could be located in the density maps. The final model contains 284 nucleic acid atoms, 2 cobalt hexammine ions, and 57 water molecules. The crystallographic refinement parameters are listed in Table 1. The atomic coordinates have been deposited with the Nucleic Acid Database (Berman et al., 1992; ID #ZDG057).

Structure solution and refinement
The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method. Rotation searches with A-DNA (Mooers et al., 1995), B-DNA (Chen et al., 1994), and Z-DNA (Wang et al., 1979) hexamer duplexes gave best results for Z-DNA. The translation search with the best orientation using 591 reflections in the 8.0-3.0 A range with F > 10o(F) gave the solution with an R factor of 48.5%. A rigid body refinement using the X-PLOR program package (Brunger, 1990) dropped the R-value to 40.2%. The data were extended to 2.0 A resolution, and positional and overall B-factor refinement resulted in an R-value of 36.7%. The model was then annealed by heating the system to 4000 K and slowly cooling to room temperature with 0.5-fs sampling intervals, dropping the R-value to 28.6%. Positional and individual B-factor refinement, extending the resolution to 1.65 A with 3598 reflections [F > 2or(F)], raised the R-value to 30.3%. The omit difference (Fob,s-FC,) map clearly showed the electron density for the omitted residues and was also used to position the 5'-overhang G residues on the two strands, which formed reverse Hoogsteen basepairs (Fig. 1).

self-complementary residues 2-7/9-14 and the 5'-G1 and G8 as overhangs (Fig. 2). The molecular structure and crystal packing of the heptamer are shown in Fig. 3. The helices stack head-to-tail pseudocontinuously along the caxis. GI stacks within the strand while G8 loops out to basepair with GI of an adjacent duplex. Thus the two overhang G's of the reference duplex basepair with two different adjacent duplexes. The G G basepair formed is reverse Hoogsteen from parallel strands of adjacent duplexes. The reverse Hoogsteen basepair stacks on the central Z-DNA duplex portion with six Watson-Crick C * G basepairs.

Nucleoside and backbone conformation
Table 2 lists the sugar-phosphate backbone and glycosidic torsion angles for the heptamer structure. It is seen that the nucleosides in the central part of the sequence (C2-C6/C9C 13) have the same sugar pucker and glycosidic conformation as in regular Z-DNA, namely, antilC2'-endo for C and syn/C3'-endo for G (Wang et al., 1984). The overhang residues GI and G8 are both in the anti glycosidic conformation and adopt a C2'-endo sugar pucker as in B-DNA. The 3'-terminal residues G7 and G14 are intermediate between Z- and B-DNA, having the C2'-endo sugar pucker as in B-DNA and syn glycosidic conformation as in Z-DNA. The conformations of G7 and G14 are the same as those of the 3'-terminal G's in the hexamer Z-DNA d(CGCGCG) (Wang et al., 1979).

X-PLOR are shown in Fig. 4, a and b. Besides the two standard hydrogen bonds (G1)N1-H... N7(G8) (1.72 A) and (G1)N2-H... 06(G8) (2.05 A), a bifurcated hydrogen bond (G1)N2-H... N7(G8) (2.39 A) and a "forced" weak C-H... 0 hydrogen bond interaction (Jeffrey and Saenger, 1991) (G8)C8-H... 06(G1) (2.52 A and with an angle of 138.10 between C-H-O) are formed. The basepair is also stabilized by interaction with water molecules. GI is hydrated by three water molecules at N3, 06, C8, and N7. Atoms NI and 06 of G8 are hydrogen-bonded to one water molecule while N3 and N2 to two and three water molecules, respectively. These water molecules form a water string bridged by N2, spanning the Watson-Crick sites of G8 (Fig. 4 d).

by Co I), P11, P13, P14, and base G12 from three adjacent duplexes. P4 and P11 are in ZII conformation while the others are in ZI. In the present structure cobalt hexammine ions bind phosphates not only in GpC steps (P4, P11, P13) but also in CpG steps (P5, P14).

Hydration of the structure
The present heptamer structure reveals the common water structure motifs for the Z-DNA hexamer d(CGCGCG) (Gessner et al., 1994). Ten water molecules in the minor groove constitute the two different motifs: 1) the water bridge between 02 keto groups of cytosine from alternating strands, and 2) the water bridge between N2 amino groups of guanosine and phosphate groups (Fig. 7 a). The first motif is intact while the second is disrupted near the end of the duplex. In the major groove surface, eight water molecules constitute two water structure motifs: 1) the water bridge connecting the N4 amino group of cytosine in alternating strands, and 2) the water bridge linking the 06 keto group of guanine in alternating strands (Fig. 7 b). The second motif is disrupted at the binding site of Co I, where two regular water bridges are missing and the central bridge is connected to an ammonia.

Stacking of G * G basepair
Fig. 5 shows the base stacking of the overhang G * G basepair with the adjacent C * G basepairs in the duplex portion. The orientation angle between the overlapping G7 and GI is -30° (Fig. 5 a), while that between G8 and G14 is -900 (Fig. 5 b). In both cases, the N4 group of cytosine stays inside the five- or six-membered aromatic ring of guanosine, respectively. It is obvious that the presence of this overhang basepair greatly increases the stacking interaction between the two adjacent duplexes, thus stabilizing the crystal structure.

Cobalt hexammine ion binding Two ordered cobalt hexammine ions, referred to as Co I and II, bind to strand I and strand II, respectively (Fig. 3 a). The details of the coordination of cobalt hexammine ions to the heptamer are shown in Fig. 6. Table 3 gives the distance of these interactions. Co I binds to phosphate groups P4, P5, P14, and base G5 from two adjacent duplexes. P4 is in ZIn conformation while the other two phosphates are in Z,. Co II binds to phosphate groups P4 (the same phosphate bound

DISCUSSION Flexibility of overhang bases The less constrained overhang bases are conformationally more flexible. For instance, the DNA sequences of d(GCGAATTCG) (Meervelt et al., 1995) and d(GGCCAATTGG) (Vlieghe et al., 1996) with one or two overhang G's formed the major groove triplets. When the present sequence d(GCGCGCG) was designed, both overhang G's were expected to stay in the helix, producing an infinite duplex along the helix axis (Wahl et al., 1996) or to form a (C * G)*G triplet by interacting with the terminal C * G

The bond lengths and bond angles of the connected hydrogen atoms are as follows: C8-H: 1.05 A; N7-C8-H: 123.00; N9-C8-H: 123.0°; NI H: 1.01 A; C2-C1-H: 118.0°; C6-C1-H: 115.20; N2-H: 1.01 A; C2-N2-H1: 120.0°; C2-N2-H2: 120.00; H1-N2-H2: 120.00.

basepair in the major groove (Meervelt et al., 1995; Vlieghe et al., 1996) or in the minor groove (Ramakrishnan and Sundaralingam, 1993). However, the conformations of the overhang G's are different. GI stacks within the duplex while G8 loops out to form a reverse Hoogsteen basepair with GI of an adjacent duplex (Fig. 3). This is the first observation of a reverse Hoogsteen G G basepair stacked with a hexamer Z-DNA helix. The present conformation for the overhang bases adds yet another motif, in addition to the observed minor/major groove triplets. This reflects the polymorphism of overhang bases. Z-DNA is normally characterized by a number of strongly alternating structural features that are in phase with the base-sequence alternation. Guanosine usually adopts the C3 '-endo sugar pucker and a syn conformation about the glycosidic bond, while cytidine is usually in the C2'-endo pucker and anti glycosidic conformation. The present struc-

ture can be explained by the conformational flexibility of the overhang G's, which are less restricted than the other

residues in the helix. The overhang G's adopt the antilC2'endo conformations, which deviate from the syn/C3'-endo pattern observed in the Z-DNA duplex. A similar precedent is seen in d(CCGCGG) (Malinina et al., 1994), where the central tetramer d(CGCG) forms the Z-DNA duplex with the 5'-terminal Cl pushed away from the duplex and G6 is stacked within the Z-DNA duplex. The major difference in the latter is that Cl and G6 are complementary bases.

G * G basepairing G * G basepairs exist in DNA telomeric quadruplex and in (purine * pyrimidine)*purine DNA triplet structures. G-quartets with G * G Hoogsteen basepairs are found in

G(anti) * G(anti) Hoogsteen basepairing is also displayed in the crystal structures of the 5'-overhang B-DNA of d(GCGAATTCG) (Meervelt et al., 1995) and the B-DNA duplex d(CGCGAATTGGCG)2 (Skelly et al., 1993). Both G(anti) * G(anti) Hoogsteen and reverse Hoogsteen basepairs have been observed in the crystal structure of the B-DNA d(GGCCAATTGG) (Vlieghe et al., 1996), in which the 5'-overhang G's invade the major groove of a symmetry-related duplex to form a (C * G)*G base triplet with the terminal C * G basepair. All these basepairs involve hydrogen-bonding of the 06 and N7 atoms of one G residue to the NI and N2 atoms of the other G residue. Fig. 4, a and b show a comparison of the conformations and hydrogen bonding of the observed reverse Hoogsteen

Besides the expected hydrogen bonds between Nl(Gl) to N7(G8) and N2(G1) to 06(G8), the shifting of the G bases relative to each other in the present structure has resulted in a new bifurcated hydrogen bond between N2(G1) and N7(G8) and enhancing the C-H ... 0 interaction (Fig. 4 c).

Cobalt hexammine ion binding Cobalt hexammine ions have been regarded as very effective in stabilizing the left-handed Z-DNA helix (Behe and Felsenfeld, 1981; Brennan et al., 1986). Gessner et al. (1985) found that two cobalt hexammine ions interact with guanine and phosphates in GpC steps and the phosphates are in ZII conformation. In the present structure, both ZI and ZII conformations for the phosphates are observed when
cobalt hexammine ions bind. It is noted that when cobalt hexammine ion binds to both a phosphate and a nearby G residue, the phosphate is in ZII conformation otherwise the phosphate is in ZI conformation.

FIGURE 7 Hydration of the heptamer structure d(GCGCGCG). (a) Water structure in the minor groove. The backbones of the heptamer are shown in dark lines as zig-zag chains, while hydrogen bonds are shown as light lines. (b) Water structure in the major groove.

Conformations of overhangs
It has been shown that the Tm for {d[(GC)3TT]}2 (54.2 ± 0.5°C) is essentially the same as that for {d[TT(CG)3]}2 (54.4 + 0.5°C) (Senior et al., 1988). Based on this result, the structure of Scheme 1, {d[(GC)3G ]}2L and Scheme 2, {d[G(CG)3]}2, should have similar thermal stability. In other words, these two different conformations are expected to coexist in the solution. The crystallization of the former may lead to the A- or B-duplex conformation with 3'overhang G' s, while the crystallization of the latter may lead to the Z-duplex with 5'-overhang G's. Fig. 8 shows the circular dichroism (CD) spectra for the present heptamer d(GCGCGCG) and hexamer d(CGCGCG) in both 2.5 M

and 5 M NaCl solutions. The spectra indicate clearly that the present heptamer adopts the B-form in both high and low salt. In contrast, the hexamer undergoes B-Z transition from low salt to high salt. The crystalline state of the heptamer d(GCGCGCG) adopts the left-handed Z-form with 5'-overhangs even in low salt crystallization conditions. However, in solution it seems that dehydrating the heptamer with 5 M NaCl does not result in the B-Z transition. The packing interactions and the hydration in the crystal may influence the outcome.
