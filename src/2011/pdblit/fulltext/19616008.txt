A B S T R A C T . The aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) represent a growing oxidoreductase superfamily. Forty proteins

have been identified and characterized as AKRs, and an additional fourteen genes may encode proteins related to the superfamily. Found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the AKRs metabolize a wide range of substrates, including aliphatic aldehydes, monosaccharides, steroids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics. This broad substrate specificity has caused problems in naming these proteins. Enzymes capable of these reactions have been referred to as aldehyde reductase (ALR1), aldose reductase (ALR2), and carbonyl reductase (ALR3); however, ALR3 is not a member of the AKR superfamily. Also, some AKRs have multiple names based upon substrate specificity. For example, human 3c~-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3~-HSD) type I is also known as dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 4 and chlordecone reductase. To address these issues, we propose a new nomenclature system for the AKR superfamily based on amino acid sequence identities. Cluster analysis of the AKRs shows seven distinct families at the 40% amino acid identity level. The largest family (AKR1) contains the aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases, and HSDs. Other families include the prokaryotic AKRs, the plant chalcone reductases, the Shaker channels, and the ethoxyquin-inducible aflatoxin B 1 aldehyde reductase. At the level of 60% amino acid identity, subfamilies are discernible. For example, the AKR1 family includes five subfamilies: (A) aldehyde reductases (mammalian); (B) aldose reductases; (C) HSDs; (D) k4-3-ketosteroid-513-reductases; and (E) aldehyde reductases (plant). This cluster analysis forms the basis for our nomenclature system. Recommendations for naming an aldo-keto reductase include the root symbol "AKR," an Arabic number designating the family, a letter indicating the subfamily when multiple subfamilies exist, and an Arabic numeral representing the unique protein sequence. For example, human aldehyde reductase would be assigned as AKRIA1. Our nomenclature is both systematic and expandable, thereby allowing assignment of consistent designations for newly identified members of the superfamily, mOCHEMPHARMACOL54;6:639--647, 1997. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

T h e AKRsq[ represent a growing superfamily of N A D ( P ) ( H ) - d e p e n d e n t oxidoreductases [1, 2]. Proteins of the A K R superfamily are monomeric (odl3)s-barrel proteins, about 320 amino acids in length, which bind N A D ( P ) ( H ) without a Rossmann-fold motif [3-7]. Found in mammals, amphibians, plants, yeast, protozoa, and bacteria, the AKRs metabolize a range of substrates including aliphatic aldehydes, monosaccharides, steroids, prostaglandins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and isoflavinoid phytoalexins. In addition, many mammalian AKRs are drug * A preliminary account of this paper was presented at the 8th International Workshop on the Enzymologyand Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism held in Deadwood, SD, between June 29 and July 3, 1996.

targets. Aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21 ) has been implicated in the development of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy because it converts glucose to the hyperosmotic sugar sorbitol, and inhibitors for this enzyme are sought as potential treatments for these complications of diabetes [8]. Inhibitors of aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2), which metabolizes neurotransmitter aldehydes produced by monoamine oxidase, may have anti-depressant properties [9]. T h e HSDs that belong to this superfamily convert potent steroid hormones into their inactive metabolites and regulate the amount of hormone available for steroid receptors [10, 11]. Inhibitors of these enzymes may modulate steroid hormone action. Furthermore, AKRs that transform prostaglandins, e.g. 3oL-HSD (EC 1.1.1.213) and prostaglandin F synthase (EC 1.1.1.188), are targets for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [12, 13]. T h e rapid progress in identifying members of the superfamily has led to problems in naming these proteins, and the need for an acceptable nomenclature system is acute. Substrate specificity formed the basis of previous naming

schemes for members of this superfamily. Turner and Flynn [14] originally proposed a classification system that included the three major enzymes involved in carbonyl metabolism. Aldehyde reductase, aldose reductase, and carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184) were designated ALR1, ALR2, and ALR3, respectively. However, carbonyl reductase is a member of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/ reductase superfamily [15], and the adoption of this nomenclature was not universal. Also, recent additions to the supeffamily have outdated this system. Likewise, the broad substrate specificity of some AKR proteins has led to single members of the superfamily having multiple names. For example, human liver 3oL-HSD type I [16] is also known as dihydrodiol dehydrogenase type 4 (EC 1.3.1.20) [17] and as chlordecone reductase (EC 1.1.1.255) [18]. To clarify the naming of AKRs, we have proposed a new nomenclature for the superfamily. Our system uses divisions within the superfamily based upon amino acid sequence identity and provides a straightforward method for assigning a consistent nomenclature. This nomenclature is both systematic and flexible, and can accommodate newly identified members of this growing superfamily.

M E T H O D OF SEQUENCE C O M P I L A T I O N AND COMPARISON Members of the AKR superfamily were identified by screening the GenBank (GB), the Protein Identification Resource (PIR), and Swiss-Prot (SP) databases with the amino acid sequence of rat liver 3ot-HSD [19] using the BLAST program [20, 21]. Additional sequences were added from the literature. The multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1) used PILEUP from the GCG system [22]. To minimize the number of gaps introduced into the alignments, the gap and gap length penalties were set to 5.0 and 0.25, respectively. In addition, alignments were not weighted based on predicted or known secondary structure. The resulting dendrogram showing the relative percent amino acid identity among the AKRs was generated by PILEUP.

encoded by these cDNAs remain unidentified or uncharacterized (Table 2). Multiple sequence comparison of the forty AKR amino acid sequences indicates that ten residues are invariant in the primary structures--G45, D50, E58, G62, K84, Pl19, G164, P186, Q190, and $271 (numbering corresponds to the sequence of rat liver 3ot-HSD which was used for the alignment). Two of these residues (D50 and K84) along with Y55 and H117 (which are not strictly conserved) may have roles in catalysis. In other family members, D50, K84, Q190, and $271 are often involved in cofactor binding. When the secondary structure elements of rat liver 3o~HSD [6] are included above the alignment, other conserved residues are found in the 13-strands, cx-helices, and short loops of the barrel. This suggests that these residues may be important in maintaining the overall structure. Also, the size and composition of the eight 13-strands and the eight or-helices forming the core of the barrel are generally conserved. The three loops found on the C-terminal side of the barrel display the greatest variation in both size and sequence, and could serve functional roles in ligand recognition. The need to maintain a common scaffold while altering loops to achieve ligand specificity is a feature of (o~/[3)s-barrel proteins [68]. Analysis using the percent amino acid identity of the AKRs showed that these proteins fall into seven distinct clusters within the superfamily (Fig. 2). The mammalian aldehyde reductases, aldose reductases, and HSDs, and the plant aldehyde reductases form the AKR1 cluster. The apple and yeast proteins of the AKR2 and AKR3 clusters metabolize monosaccharide substrates similar to those used by the aldehyde reductases and aldose reductases of the previous family. Cluster AKR4 consists of a polyketide reductase and the chalcone reductases; and cluster AKR5 is formed by the prokaryotic and protozoan AKRs. The most distantly related clusters are the Shaker K + channel [3subunits of AKR6 and the ethoxyquin-inducible aflatoxin B~ aldehyde reductase of AKR7. The division of the superfamily into seven distinct clusters, or families, provides a rational basis for a new AKR nomenclature system. THE N E W N O M E N C L A T U R E

OVERVIEW OF THE SUPERFAMILY To date, forty members of the AKR superfamily have been cloned and the encoded protein expressed or characterized in some fashion (Table 1). While the mammalian aldehyde reductases, aldose reductases, and HSDs represent the bulk of the superfamily, other AKRs have been identified in plants, yeast, and bacteria. Also, some members of the superfamily are not carbonyl oxidoreductases. For example, the A4-3-ketosteroid-5[3-reductases function as carbon-carbon double bond reductases; p.crystallin is primarily a lens structural protein; and the role of the Shaker K + channel [3-subunit in channel inactivation is unclear [58]. Fourteen additional sequences encoding potential AKRs were not included in these alignments because the proteins

The system we propose is similar to the nomenclature for the cytochrome P450 superfamily [69], but, unlike that system, the nomenclature for the AKR superfamily uses amino acid sequence comparisons since detailed gene structures of most AKRs remain unknown at this time. The general format for new AKR names will be as follows: the root symbol "AKR" for Aldo-Keto Reductase; an Arabic number designating the family; a letter indicating the subfamily when multiple subfamilies exist; and an Arabic numeral representing the unique protein sequence. Under this system, the protein AKR1A1 would be the first AKR in family 1, subfamily A. Delineation of families occurs at the 40% amino acid identity level. Members of an AKR family should have

~<40% amino acid identity with any other family. At present, the seven families defined by our cluster analysis satisfies this criterion. Within a given family, subfamilies may be defined by a />60% identity in amino acid sequence among subfamily members. By this definition, four of the seven AKR families include multiple subfamilies. For example, family AKR1 includes the following subfamilies: (A) mammalian aldehyde reductases; (B) mammalian aldose reductases; (C) the HSDs; (D) the k-3-ketosteroid-513-reductases; and (E) 4 plant aldehyde reductases. Numbering of the known members of each subfamily was assigned in an arbitrary fashion. For example, AKR1A1, AKR1A2, and AKR1A3 are the

aldehyde reductases from human, pig, and rat, respectively. Any new additions to a subfamily will be numbered chronologically. Allelic variation may occur between superfamily members. We propose that proteins with i>97% amino acid sequence identity are alleles of the same gene unless: they have different enzyme activities; they are encoded by different cDNAs, usually evident by a distinct 3'-untranslated region (UTR); and they are derived from genes of different structure. While human dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 1 (DD1) and human dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 2 (DD2) are 98% identical in amino acid sequence and have Y-UTRs that are 97% identical, the substrate specificity

recommend that investigators assign a function to their AKR cDNA clones. To facilitate the naming of newly discovered AKRs, a web-site has been established at http://pharme26.med.upenn.edu. This web-site includes the tables and figures of this paper, and will be updated as new AKRs are added to the superfamily. It also provides instructions on how to deposit new AKR sequences for inclusion into this nomenclature system. The procedure for the submission of a new sequence to obtain a systematic name is as follows: (1) Since the proposed nomenclature system is proteinbased, the newly identified AKR will require that the amino acid sequence has been obtained by either cDNA cloning or by direct methods. The protein encoded by a cDNA should be either overexpressed or purified from its natural source. Investigators should provide GenBank, Swiss-Prot, or PIR accession numbers. (2) Upon submission of a complete protein sequence, it will be matched against the AKRs in the database and placed within the cluster analysis. The location of the sequence within the superfamily cluster analysis will determine its assigned designation. As needed, new families and subfamilies will be added to the existing system. (3) The sequence and the assigned designation will be returned to the submitter, but the database will not be updated until the submission has been published. We encourage the submitter to use the new assignment in their publication. It is an investigator's responsibility to notify the web-site that the information submitted has been published and provide the appropriate citation.

and function of these proteins are quite different [33]. DD1 is predominantly a 20c~-HSD while DD2 is the major bile acid binding protein in human liver. Based on these functional differences, we have assigned DD1 and DD2 as unique members of the AKR superfamily. However, it is not known with any certainty if these AKRs represent alleles of the same gene, and resolution of this issue will require genomic cloning and analysis of gene structure. Finally, the designation for an AKR superfamily gene should be noted in italics to distinguish between the gene and the protein. For example, the gene A K R 1 A I encodes the protein AKR1A1. NAMING THE ALDO-KETO REDUCTASES At the 8th International Workshop on the Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism, the proposed nomenclature system was adopted. It was recommended that a World-Wide Web page should be established for the submission of new AKR sequences to our existing database (see below). The new designations for the forty AKRs using the above criteria are indicated in Fig. 2. For historical reasons, the AKR1A subfamily represents the aldehyde reductases and the AKR1B subfamily represents the aldose reductases. To ease the adoption of the nomenclature system, we recommend that authors referencing members of the AKR superfamily use the old name with the new designation in parentheses until universal adoption of the system occurs-for example, human aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). Since our nomenclature system is based on amino acid sequence comparisons, we have not assigned designations to the fourteen potential AKRs listed in Table 2 because the proteins have not been expressed or characterized. We

SUMMARY The need for a systematic and flexible nomenclature has arisen as new members of the AKR superfamily have been identified. The proposed system is similar to that used in the P450 superfamily but is based on amino acid sequence comparisons and not gene structure. Our system uses percent amino acid identity to define families and subfamilies within the larger AKR superfamily. We have also outlined a submission procedure for the assignment of names to newly cloned and characterized AKR proteins. As new AKRs are added to those already identified, this flexible nomenclature system will facilitate the easy incorporation of new proteins into the superfamily and the assignment of consistent designations to these proteins. Placement of new AKRs within the superfamily may ultimately lead to prediction of function.
