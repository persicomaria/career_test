(Received 13 July 1998)

The crystal structure of subtilisin DY inhibited by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethyl ketone has been solved by molecular replacement with subtilisin Carlsberg as the starting model. The model has been refined to a crystallographic R factor (  | |Fo| |Fc| | /  |F o|) of 15.1% using Xray diffraction data to 0.175 nm resolution. Subtilisin DY is an alkaline proteinase from the X-irradiated Japanese strain DY of Bacillus licheniformis, which normally produces subtilisin Carlsberg. It has very similar properties to subtilisin Carlsberg, with a slightly enhanced resistance to heat and guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation, in spite of the fact that the sequences of the two enzymes differ in 31 positions out of 274 residues. The close similarity in overall three-dimensional structure of subtilisins DY and Carlsberg and also their physicochemical properties, such as activity and stability, shows that nature aided by X-irradiation for rapid `evolution' is able to accommodate considerable changes in sequence without substantial changes in property. Keywords : subtilisin; X-ray structure ; sequence variability; X-irradiation; mutagenesis.

Subtilisins form a well-characterised family of extracellular alkaline serine proteinases, which have been found in various species of Bacillus [1], as well as in fungi and yeasts and even in higher eukaryotes, such as worms, insects and plants [2]. The increasing interest over the last decades in these enzymes has been due to the biological and industrial significance of their proteolytic activity. Since subtilisins have a very broad substrate specificity and are highly stable at neutral and alkaline pH, they are of considerable industrial importance as protein-degrading additives to detergents.

Many studies have been carried out to understand the molecular basis of their mechanism, stability and specificity. Genetically engineered mutants of subtilisins have been extensively investigated [3 9]. Crystal structures of several subtilisin-like proteins have been reported ([9 11] and references therein). Subtilisin DY is secreted by an X-ray irradiated strain of Bacillus licheniformis [12] and was isolated in a homogeneous state [13]. Sequence studies show high similarity of subtilisin DY to subtilisin Carlsberg [14], with 29 substitutions out of 274 residues (but see below). Comparing the physicochemical properties of the two enzymes, subtilisin DY is less susceptible to oxidation in the presence of hematoporphyrin [15] and shows slightly enhanced stability to heat and guanidine hydrochlorideinduced denaturation [16]. The melting temperature of subtilisin DY is 4°C higher than that of the wild-type Carlsberg. The kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of succinyl-Ala2-Phe-methylcoumarylamide [17] and several peptidyl-4-nitroanilides [18] do not differ significantly from the kinetic constants for subtilisin Carlsberg. Co-crystallisation experiments with subtilisin DY and the proteinase inhibitor eglin-c [19] suggested that DY hydrolyses the peptide bond between residues 45 and 46 in the reactive centre of eglin-c, unlike other known subtilisins including Carlsberg. In this paper, we describe the 0.175-nm resolution analysis of the crystal structure of subtilisin DY in a 1:1 complex with the synthetic inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethyl ketone. For subtilisin Carlsberg in complex with the proteinase inhibitor eglin-c, two independently refined crystallographic models were available [20, 21]. If not stated otherwise, the model refined by Bode and co-workers is taken as the refer-

ence structure. The large number of local differences arising from the 31 amino acid substitutions between the two enzymes does not give rise to substantial changes in overall fold or in physicochemical properties. Indeed the Bacillus subtilisin fold seems able to accept this substantial number of substitutions with an essentially neutral effect, demonstrating the considerable redundancy in protein sequence for desired function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallisation. As described earlier [22] crystals of subtilisin DY inhibited by N-benzyloxy-carbonyl-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethyl ketone were grown by hanging-drop vapour diffusion. The drops contained initially 20 mg/ml protein, 4% poly(ethylene glycol) 4000, 0.33 M NaCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2 in 18 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and were equilibrated against reservoirs containing 10% poly(ethylene glycol) 4000, 1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The crystals grew at 16°C within 20 days to a size of 0.70 0.30 0.15 mm and belong to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a 5.28 nm, b 7.27 nm and c 5.98 nm and one molecule per asymmetric unit. Data collection and processing. Diffraction data were recorded on a MAR-research imaging plate detector using synchrotron radiation from the EMBL beam line X11 at DESY, Hamburg. The wavelength of the radiation was 0.092 nm. Two complete data sets were collected from the same crystal at 4°C, with crystal-to-detector distances of 145 mm and 220 mm. For the assignment of the cell constants and data processing, the program DENZO [23] was used. A total of 101 587 reflections was measured, which yielded 22887 unique reflections, representing 96.7% of the available data in the range 1.0 0.175 nm. Including all data with no  cut-off, the merging R factor ( |I I | /  I) for the symmetry-equivalent reflections was 3.0%, rising to 5.2 % for the highest resolution shell. The fraction of reflections with intensity greater than 3  in the highest resolution shell was 92.2%. The crystal clearly diffracted to higher resolution, but the time available for data collection suggested this cut-off as appropriate. Structure refinement. The structure was solved by molecular replacement applying the program AMORE [24] with the coordinates of subtilisin Carlsberg [20] as search model. The solutions were clear and unambiguous in terms of both  and relative height. The structure was refined using the restrained least-squares minimisation procedure of Konnert and Hendrickson [25], incorporating the fast-Fourier algorithm [26] as implemented in the CCP4 program suite [27]. Throughout the refinement, reflections with (I) 0 were used. The weighting scheme used for the stereochemical restraints together with the standard deviations from the target values are shown in Table 1. The program FRODO [28] was used for all molecular graphics operations. These included inspection of the model with both (3Fo 2Fc) and (2Fo 2Fc) Fourier syntheses and `omit' maps. A total of 82 cycles of least-squares minimisation was carried out, divided up into 16 steps. After each step, rebuilding of side-chain conformations and introduction of solvent molecules were performed. By inspection of the maps, solvent molecules were added to the model at chemically reasonable positions where the difference density of the (2Fo 2Fc ) synthesis exceeded 3 . The structural effects of the sequence changes between subtilisin DY and subtilisin Carlsberg [20] were investigated by superimposing the structurally equivalent atoms using the program LSQKAB [29]. The nomenclature of Schechter and Berger [30] was used for the binding subsites of subtilisin DY : the amino acid residues

Na and 219 water molecules. All atoms have been assigned unit occupancy, except for the alternative side-chain conformations of serines 99, 103, 145, 204 and 216 and of valine 270. The crystallographic R factor of the model is 15.1% for all 22 887 reflections between 1.0 nm and 0.175 nm. The rms error in the atomic coordinates was estimated as 0.013 nm from the A plot of Read [31]. The model conforms well with standard geometry; 88% of all non-glycine and non-proline residues have main-chain torsion angles in the most favourable region of the Ramachandran plot [32, 33] (Fig. 1). None of the non-glycine residues lie outside the allowed regions. The average isotropic temperature factors B 82 u2 for various parts of the model are listed in Table 2. A small number of regions shows substantial thermal motion or static disorder, which is reflected in very weak density in the Fourier syntheses and higher values of the corresponding temperature factors. There are only 16 residues with one or more atoms having a B value greater than 0.30 nm2 : Lys43, Ser52, Gly53, Glu54, Tyr104, Glu112, Gln116, Gln137, Lys141, Asn158, Ser159, Gly160, Ser161, Gln162, Asp172 and Gln275 (Fig. 2). None lies in the `functional' regions, such as the active site or the Ca2 binding sites. Tyr104 is part of the S4 site, which is discussed below together with the catalytic and specificity sites. Homology with other subtilisins. The amino acid sequences for subtilisin DY and seven other subtilisins are aligned in

Fig. 3. The sequences of subtilisin Carlsberg [20], subtilisin BPN [34], SavinaseTM [11], mesentericopeptidase [10], thermitase [35] and proteinase K [36] are based on those established by the X-ray studies, which in some cases updated those originally determined. For aqualysin I [37], the gene sequence is used as published. The percentage of identities between the sequences is given in Table 3, showing the high homology of subtilisin DY to the other Bacillus subtilisins. For subtilisin DY, the originally determined protein sequence [14] is shown with two changes. During the refinement of the X-ray structure, unequivocal evidence emerged from the electron density that the true identity of Ala37 and Ala194 was actually Ser37 and Ser194. This was subsequently confirmed by amino acid sequence analysis of tryptic fragments of subtilisin DY. Thus, these two alanines were changed to serines in Fig. 3, in the final coordinate set and in all discussions. After introducing these two changes, DY differs from subtilisin Carlsberg in 31 positions. The structural effects of the sequence changes are discussed in the appropriate sections. The overall structure. As expected from the structures of other members of the subtilisin family, subtilisin DY is classified as

an A/ protein; the general folding follows closely that described for BPN [34] and Carlsberg [21, 38]. Fig. 4 shows the A-carbon chain of subtilisin DY superimposed on that of Carlsberg. The average deviation of the 274 structurally equivalent CA atoms is only 0.033 nm, indicating very close similarity. Superimposing all main chain atoms, only 13 residues differ in the position of main chain atoms by more than 0.10 nm; residues 38, 61, 99 101, 118, 130, 158 161, 211 and 275 (Fig. 5). Only in residues 38, 118, 158 161 and 211 are there deviations of the backbone caused by neighbouring mutations. Most

of the 31 sequence changes between subtilisins DY and Carlsberg (Figs 3 and 4) leave the course of the protein backbone unchanged. 20 of the substitutions are on the surface of the molecule and protrude into the solvent. Another six replacements are in surface crevices, but the changes are conservative in terms of the volume occupied by the side chains or non-conservative changes are compensated by other changes nearby in space. The largest discrepancy in main chain atoms occurs at residue 211, with 0.42 nm between the carbonyl oxygens (Fig. 5). The peptide bond between residues 211 and 212 is flipped in

subtilisin DY compared with the conformation in Carlsberg. The carbonyl oxygen of Ser211 forms a hydrogen bond to the OG of Ser38, shortening the backbone backbone distance between the five-membered turn 209 213 and the  turn 36 39 (Fig. 6). In Carlsberg, the surface crevice between the two turns is filled with the side chain of Gln36, replaced by an alanine in subtilisin DY. As in Carlsberg, the peptide at position 211 is in the cis conformation. The side chain of this non-proline cis peptide is held in place by a well-defined bridge of two water molecules connecting the OG of Ser211 and the nitrogen atom of Asp59. Another solvent molecule connects the OG of Ser211 with the carbonyl oxygen of the symmetry related Gly#126. Due to the changes Pro40Thr and Gln36Ala, the side chain of Asn212 is rotated about 110° around 1 to form a hydrogen bond between the OG1 of Thr40 and OD1 of Asn212, linked to NE2 of Gln36 in Carlsberg. Apart from the changes Gln36Ala, Pro40Thr and Thr211Ser, two other replacements have a significant influence on the course of the main chain (Fig. 4). Due to the substitution Arg145Ser, the protein backbone is displaced in the region around residue 118, with a maximum of 0.1 nm in the position of the A-carbon atom of 118. The bulky arginine side chain in subtilisin Carlsberg widens the last turn of the helix AD from 115 to 118 (Fig. 7). In position 162, glutamine (threonine in Carlsberg) forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Ser159,

narrowing the surface loop 158 164, which forms the outermost part of the S1-binding loop (Figs 7 and 8). This is also reflected in shortening the hydrogen bond in the -turn 159 161 by 0.03 nm to 0.285 nm. A second peptide flip relative to subtilisin Carlsberg occurs at position 130, leading to a positional discrepancy of 0.32 nm between the carbonyl oxygens. The reversal of the peptide bond is in concert with a change in the position of the side chain of Tyr104, which is part of the hydrophobic P4 binding pocket. The reversed conformation of residue 130 is caused by the inhibitor and is discussed in the section about the specificity sites, together with the positional deviations of residues 99 101, which also form part of the substrate binding region. Catalytic and specificity sites. In the subtilisins, the amino acids comprising the active site and the substrate binding regions are highly conserved (Fig. 3). The structural aspects of the catalytic mechanism have been discussed in several reviews [39 41]. The residues directly involved in hydrolysis are Asp32, His64 and Ser221 in subtilisin DY, and are located at the edge of the central  sheet, with Asp32 being the last residue of the strand 1 and His64 and Ser221 positioned at the beginning of helices AC and AF, respectively. The synthetic inhibitor Z-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethyl ketone is covalently bound to the side chains of His64 and Ser221

(Fig. 9). The thick, blue dashed lines in the figure represent the covalent bonds between the NE2 atom of His64 and the methylene carbon atom of the inhibitor, and between the OG atom of the catalytic Ser221 and the ketone carbonyl carbon of the inhibitor. The second bond requires the carbonyl carbon to be in the hemiketal form with tetrahedral configuration. The hemiketal form is stabilised by two hydrogen bonds from the oxyanion to the side chain ND2 of Asn155 and to the main chain NH of Ser221. Superimposing the refined coordinates of the three catalytic residues of DY and Carlsberg independently of the rest of the molecule, there is a mean discrepancy of only 0.032 nm between the 24 atoms. The largest deviations of about 0.055 nm are in the positions of the histidine, caused by a slight rotation of the ring around the CA-C and C-C bonds upon binding of the Z-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethyl ketone inhibitor. The substrate recognition site is made up of the two peptide strands 99 104 and 125 130, flanking residues P1 to P3 of the inhibitor, and the hydrophobic S1 pocket. The S1 pocket consists of residues 152 156, 166 167 and 126 127 and is identical with the S1 site of subtilisin Carlsberg within the estimated errors in atomic positions. Fig. 8 shows a superposition of the active sites of the two enzymes. As described above, the outermost part of the P1-binding loop shows higher deviations in the position of the main chain, up to a maximum of 0.16 nm at the A-carbon atom of Ser159. This part of the loop is relatively flexible and sticks out into the solvent, reflected in high temperature factors between 0.30 nm2 and 0.43 nm2 for residues 157 161 (Fig. 2). The position of this part of the loop seems not to be critical for substrate binding ; even shortening of the P1 loop appears to have no in-

fluence on the specificity of Bacillus subtilisins [11]. The significant displacement of the inhibitor recognition site in positions 99 to 101 points to an adjustment of this part of the active site to the conformations of the different inhibitors used. The same is valid for the side chain of Tyr104, which is slightly rotated to accommodate the phenolic ring of the inhibitor protection group. To adapt to the rotated conformation of the side chain of Tyr104, the peptide bond between Ser130 and Gly131 is flipped. The conformational flexibility of Tyr104 and the resulting inversion of the peptide bond between residues 130 and 131 has been observed in other crystallographic studies of subtilisins [42]. Except for the change Thr162Gln, there is only one other mutation in the vicinity of the substrate-binding region. This is Met135Leu, located on the bottom of the P4-binding pocket. Both mutations lie outside the van-der-Waals radii of even bulky substrates, such as peptidyl methylcoumarylamides, and their influence on the catalytic performance of the enzymes is negligible. Subtilisin DY was previously observed to hydrolyse the reactive site loop of the inhibitor eglin-c during the course of crystallisation [19]. This is in contrast to subtilisin Carlsberg and other subtilisins, which appear to form stable complexes, in solution and in the crystal, with eglin-c and indeed other inhibitors such as the cysteine-free one from potato [43]. Given the near identity of the specificity and catalytic sites, this probably reflects the long time of several weeks required for growth of crystals (of nicked eglin-c rather than the complex) in the case of DY, rather than a real difference in kinetic properties. Such long incubation periods have not been investigated during kinetic studies of the other enzymes.

it requires a very high temperature factor (around 0.4 nm2) compared with those of the surrounding protein ligands which are around 0.1 nm2. In several previous analyses of subtilisins, this has been taken to indicate that the second Ca 2 -binding site is only partially occupied. However, a recent analysis of the structure of a homologous Bacillus subtilisin, savinase, at atomic (0.1 nm) resolution (Dauter, Z., 1997, unpublished results) has definitely established that the metal at this site is sodium, with five coordinating oxygen ligands occupying the corners of a quadratic pyramid. Two of the five oxygen ligands are solvent molecules, hydrogen bonded with the carboxylate groups of Glu197 and Asp172. Therefore, this second metal site has been assigned as sodium in subtilisin DY. The temperature factor then refines to the more reasonable value of 0.22 nm2. The coordination of both metal binding sites is very close to those reported in subtilisin Carlsberg. Superimposing all atoms of the residues involved in metal binding, the average positional displacement between these residues in the two structures is 0.019 nm. We propose that the second site is a sodium ion in Carlsberg as well. Hydrogen-bonding network and solvent structure. Of a total of 219 solvent molecules in the final model, 14 water molecules located in the interior of the protein appear to play an important role in stabilising defined regions in the enzyme globule [8, 11]. All 14 water molecules are completely conserved between subtilisins DY and Carlsberg in terms of position and hydrogen bond interactions. While the main chain hydrogen bonding scheme of DY is identical with that of Carlsberg, some of the 31 substitutions induce local changes in the side-chain hydrogen-bonding network along the surface and in the solvent structure (Fig. 7). The most elaborate change in the hydrogen-bond network results from the replacement Gln36Ala, which significantly influences the course of the backbone, as described above. In Carlsberg, the side chain of Gln36 bridges the OG of Ser38 with the backbone nitrogen of Asn212 (Figs 6b and 7b). In DY, the OG of Ser38 forms a direct hydrogen bond to the reversed carbonyl oxygen of Ser211 (Figs 6a and 7a). The new position of the nitrogen of Ser38 allows a link to the main chain oxygen of Asn58 via a water molecule, which is absent in Carlsberg. Another two solvent molecules, which are missing in Carlsberg because of the bulky glutamine side chain, link the side chain oxygen of Ser211 with the main chain nitrogen of Asp60. This provides crosslinking of the surface-loop regions 53 62, 209 213 and 36 39, and leads to a more compact arrangement of the latter two turns. Given the large number of small changes in the detailed hydrogen-bonding patterns between Carlsberg and DY, it is difficult to assign the relative importance of any individual changes to the very small changes in properties between the two. Conclusions. The crystal structure of subtilisin DY is closely similar to that of subtilisin Carlsberg. The arrangement of residues in the active site and the substrate-binding region are almost identical, reflecting the similar catalytic performance of the two enzymes. The structural differences described in this study give no evidence as to why subtilisin DY appears to hydrolyse the PI-1-type inhibitor eglin-c, while other subtilisins and especially subtilisin Carlsberg do not. The hydrolysis probably reflects the long time period of the crystallisation rather than a true difference in kinetic properties. The small increase in stability (tm increases by only 4 °C) of subtilisin DY compared with Carlsberg, in reality, shows how successfully the structure has accommodated the 31 substitutions. It is the great similarity in properties which is of interest here, showing just how many more or less neutral changes can

Charged residues and metal-binding sites of subtilisin DY. There are five substitutions involving charged residues between the sequences of subtilisin DY and Carlsberg, which increase the number of positively charged residues by two and that of negatively charged residues by one. All are located on the surface of the protein, with distances of 2.2 2.8 nm between the active site histidine and the charged groups. Surface charges are known to influence the pH-dependence of enzyme activity [44]. The effects of these differences in the electrostatic field on enzymatic activity are extremely difficult to evaluate and are assumed to be small due to the long distance between the replacements and the active site. Between a total of 16 positively and 16 negatively charged residues in subtilisin DY, including the chain termini, there are seven positively and seven negatively charged groups involved in salt bridges that are conserved between DY and Carlsberg. Due to the replacement Asn141Lys, an additional salt bridge between Lys141 and Glu112 is possible in subtilisin DY. However, as most of the lysine side chain is completely disordered, this salt bridge is unlikely to be present here. Since small changes in model building can lead to different interpretations, the number of salt bridges is difficult to quantify absolutely. Their energy contribution is even more difficult to evaluate, but the number of bridges does appear to be similar, not only in the structures of DY and Carlsberg, but also in other Bacillus subtilisins [10]. Three of the negatively charged groups of DY are involved in metal-ion binding. Ca2 ions are known to stabilise subtilisins against thermal denaturation [45] and autolytic degradation [46]. Subtilisin DY contains two metal atoms at the same positions as in subtilisin Carlsberg [38] and in mesentericopeptidase [10]. Within the estimated error in atomic positions of about 0.013 nm, the ligand distances (Table 4) are identical with those found in the Carlsberg model. The first ion, Ca1, is tightly bound with full occupancy and a low atomic temperature factor. It is well defined in the structure with seven ligands in an approximately octahedral arrangement. As found in other subtilisins, there is in principle a second Ca 2 site, Ca2, which is more loosely bound and can be removed with EDTA under non-denaturing conditions [45, 47]. If the second metal site in the present DY structure is modelled as Ca2 ,

be incorporated in an enzyme fold with almost no change in properties. This casts some aspersions on our current ability to carry out directed mutagenesis with the aim of improving (from our point of view) or modifying the properties of enzymes ; the majority of such changes result in reduced stability or poorer kinetic properties. It seems we have a long way to go in beating nature at its selective game.
