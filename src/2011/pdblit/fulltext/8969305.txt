A helping hand for collagenases: the haemopexin-like domain
The structures of the C-terminal domains of rabbit haemopexin and full-length porcine fibroblast collagenase reveal a common P3-propeller fold with pseudo-fourfold symmetry. The interactions of these haemopexin-like domains with target proteins and ligands is,however, still a matter of debate.
Structure 15 June 1995, 3:527-530 The first collagenase to be detected, more than thirty years ago, was one involved in tadpole tail dissolution during amphibian metamorphosis [1]. Since then, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of closely related enzymes of which collagenase is a founder member, have been subjected to intense biochemical and pharmacological scrutiny [2,3]. The structure of the first full-length active collagenase, namely porcine fibroblast collagenase (PFC), is reported in this issue of Structure [4]. In an independent report (also in this issue), Faber et al. [5] present the structure of the C-terminal domain of rabbit serum haemopexin, with which the C-terminal domain of PFC is highly homologous. MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidases involved in extracellular matrix degradation. They play important roles in tissue morphogenesis and wound healing, but are also associated with pathogenic conditions such as arthritis, tumour growth and metastasis (for reviews, see [6-10]). To date, eleven human MMPs have been identified and cloned, including human fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1), human neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9), and three stromelysins, including human stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) and human stromelysin 2 (MMP-10)' All MMPs are secreted as multimodular activatable proenzymes, in most cases with an -80-residue activation peptide followed by a -165-residue catalytic domain, which in turn is connected by a linker of variable length (in the range 17-63 residues) to a -190-residue domain with sequence homology to haemopexin, a haem-binding and transporting protein from serum (see below). Matrilysin and mature metalloelastase lack the haemopexin-like domain, and the gelatinases possess an additional domain with homology to the gelatin-binding (type II) domain of fibronectin. Of all the MMPs, the interstitial collagenases (of which PFC is an example) exhibit the unique ability to cleave the same peptide bond in each of the three strands of native triple-helical collagen, producing fragments that are three-quarters and onequarter the length of the native polypeptide chain. The target collagens (types I, II and III) represent the major protein components of skin, bone, tendon and cartilage. The MMP catalytic domain The first MMP structures were reported at the beginning of 1994. Within a few days of each other, five different laboratories published X-ray or NMR structures of the catalytic domains of MMP-8, MMP-1 and MMP-3 [11-16]. These structures revealed that the catalytic MMP domain is similar to astacin [17], a digestive enzyme from crayfish, and to the catalytic module of snake venom metalloproteinases [18,19]. The catalytic domain of MMPs comprises a regularly folded 'upper' subdomain, essentially consisting of a twisted five-stranded 3-sheet flanked by two ot-helices and connecting loops, and a smaller, less regularly folded, 'lower' subdomain comprising two open loops and the C-terminal helix (Fig. 1). The catalytic zinc ion, residing at the bottom of the active-site cleft between these subdomains, was found to be bounded on one side by a characteristic helix-bend-loop structure comprising an extended HEXXHXXGXXH consensus sequence, and below by a 1,4-tight turn containing a strictly invariant methionine residue (dubbed the 'Met-turn' [17]) that follows the histidine-rich sequence and whose function is presently unknown. This catalytic zinc ion is coordinated by the imidazolyl NE2 atoms of the three consensus histidine residues and (in the free enzymes) by a water molecule which is also bound to the intermediate glutamate involved in catalysis. The MMP family shares this zinc environment, the Met-turn basement, and the overall topology with the other so-called 'metzincins' [19], a group which currently also includes the astacin, adamalysin and serralysin families [20]. In contrast to these related metzincins, the MMPs possess an additional 'structural' zinc ion, sandwiched between the 3-sheet surface and an S-shaped double loop, which connects the central strand of the sheet with the strand on the outer edge that is involved in substrate binding (Fig. 1). Full-length (latent) proforms of MMPs may differ from the shorter but activated forms in having only the catalytic zinc ion [21]. Activation and catalysis In the latent proenzymes, the activation propeptide folds over the active site. Its conserved C-terminal PRCGXPDV segment runs in a non-substrate-like (i.e. opposite) direction through the active site, with its unpaired cysteine residue coordinating to the catalytic zinc ion (K Appelt, personal communication). Activation consists of a stepwise (auto)catalytic degradation and removal of this propeptide, i.e. unblocking of the catalytic zinc [22-24]. All of the early structures of catalytic MMP domains were determined in complex with peptidic inhibitors, which contain a chelating group such as hydroxamate for 527

Ribbon drawing of full-length active collagenase, consisting of the MMP-8 catalytic domain (top) [16] and a PFC haemopexin-like domain (bottom) arranged as seen in the PFC crystal structure of Li et al. [41. A hexapeptide substrate (blue) has been modelled into the active-site cleft aligning to the outer edge strand of the -sheet [25] to give an idea of the relative geometric arrangement of a bound substrate with respect to both subdomains of the catalytic domain. The two zinc ions and two calcium ions of MMP-8 are shown in magenta and orange, respectively. Figure prepared with Insight II (Biosym Techn., San Diego). PFC coordinates courtesy of PBrick and D Blow. zinc ion ligation (see [21). These inhibitors mimic the non-primed and primed residues (where P1 [nonprimed] indicates the residue immediately before the cleavage site and P1' [primed] the residue after the cleavage site) of a bound peptide substrate. The substrate (or inhibitor) binds in an extended conformation, aligning with the 3-strand on the outer edge of the catalytic domain, under the formation of a twisted antiparallel two-stranded 3-sheet to which a loop segment from the lower subdomain adds as a third strand on the primed side of the cleavage site (Fig. 1) [25]. MMP-catalyzed cleavage seems to proceed through attack of the catalytic glutamate-bound water molecule on the scissile peptide carbonyl group of the bound substrate (i.e. via a general base-catalysis mechanism similar to that proposed for thermolysin [26]) but without the assistance of additional electrophiles, other than the catalytic zinc ion [25]. The interactions between the side chain of the P1' residue of the substrate and the surrounding substrate pocket (S1') play a major part in determining specificity and tightness of binding. The S1' pocket is deep, but differs in size and shape in the various MMPs, conferring upon them their different specificities [27]. In contrast to thermolysin, the MMPs bind their substrates in an extended conformation, with the primed-site segment at P2' and P3' threading through the small opening left by two crossing-over segments, namely the outer strand of the upper subdomain and the opposing single strand from the lower subdomain. Preliminary modelling experiments [16] revealed that collagen-like triple-helical structures are far too bulky and that each constituent single strand adopts an inappropriate conformation to allow correct interaction with the catalytic residues and the adjacent subsites; instead, catalytic cleavage seems to require release of the scissile strand from the supercoiled triple helix around the cleavage site [16]. Full-length collagenases Only full-length active collagenases are capable of cleaving native triple-helical collagen of types I, II or III. Removal of the haemopexin-like domain eliminates this capacity, but the C-terminally truncated enzymes retain their gelatinase and caseinase activities and can still degrade synthetic substrates, albeit at slightly reduced rates [28,29]. If the haemopexin-like domain and/or the linker of MMP-1 is replaced by equivalent elements of the stromelysins, the resulting hybrids lack any collagenase activity [28,30,31]. Thus, the triple-helical specificity of the collagenases is somewhat associated with the endogenous and correctly linked haemopexin-like domain. Full-length stromelysins do not degrade triple-helical collagen, but, similarly to their latent proforms or isolated C-terminal domains, they bind to reconstituted collagen fibrils [32]. In contrast, only the active full-length forms of collagenases, but not the latent proenzymes, display collagen-binding capacity [28,29,33]. These data indicate that stromelysins and collagenases interact with fibrillar collagen mainly via their haemopexin-like domains (though in different ways) and that the activity of collagenases against triple-helical substrates requires a distinct geometric cooperation between the haemopexin-like domain and the unmasked catalytic domain [8]. In contrast, the binding of gelatinases to collagen [34] and gelatin [35,36] is mediated by the fibronectin II-like domain found only in these MMPs. The haemopexinlike domain of gelatinase A appears to play a rather different role, mediating interactions with specific cell surface receptors, with subsequent activation by a 'surface-associated activator' [10,34,37,38]. This hypothetical activator might be identical to a recently detected membrane-type MMP (MMP-14), anchored to the membrane through a putative transmembrane segment inserted at the very end of the haemopexin-like domain [39]. Progelatinases A and B can be secreted in association with the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 2 and 1, respectively [40]; this inhibitor interaction is mediated through the haemopexin-like domains of the progelatinases and protects the proenzyme against activation by the hypothetical membrane activator [8].

Collagenases Bode This type of interaction of TIMPs with the latent gelatinases differs fundamentally from that with activated MMPs. In the active MMPs the protein inhibitors bind within, or close to, the active sites of the catalytic domains (see [10]). Association rates and the strength of this TIMP binding towards the activated MMPs depend on the presence of the haemopexin-like domain; the binding contribution of this domain seems to be negligible for the stromelysins [41], but quite significant in the case of gelatinase A [42,43]. The haemopexin-like domain The C-terminal domain of MMPs exhibits strong sequence homology to a number of other unrelated proteins [44], including the 'two-headed' serum protein haemopexin [45], the cell adhesion protein vitronectin [46] (which recognizes integrin receptors and binds to distinct serpins) and pea seed albumin 2 [47]. The typical haemopexin-like domain comprises -200 amino acid residues and shows a fourfold internal sequence repeat [45]. The common functional property possessed by these haemopexin-containing proteins seems to be participation in quite specific, but different protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. How does the structure permit this versatility? The X-ray crystal structures of two haemopexin-like domains - the C-terminal domain of rabbit haemopexin [5] and the C-terminal domain of PFC (porcine MMP-1) [4] - published back-to-back in this issue of Structure each reveal a [-propeller topology with pseudo-fourfold symmetry. The four blades of the propeller are made up of antiparallel four-stranded 3-sheets arranged around a funnel-shaped tunnel (see Fig. 1), which harbours a number of cations and anions. The N- and the C-terminal ends of the domain are joined by a disulphide bond, and the fourth (outermost) strand of a given sheet is covalently linked to the first (innermost) strand of the next sheet by long loops of great variability. The haemopexin domain represents the first example of a four-bladed propeller and, in contrast to previously analyzed -propeller structures of six-to-eightfold symmetry (for review, see [48]), adjacent 13-sheets are perpendicular rather than stacked on each other and the tunnel axis is narrower than in propeller structures of higher-order symmetry. Implications for substrate binding On the basis of their C-terminal structure, Baker and coworkers [5] have modelled the equivalent haem-binding N-terminal haemopexin domain. The authors conclude that at its wider end the tunnel contains a high-affinity site for larger anions, and propose that the haem might bind to a cleft close to this site, with its iron ion and the propionic acid group coordinating to two nearby histidine residues and to the anion-binding site, respectively. According to their model, the C-terminal haemopexin domain would then fold over to shield the haem-binding site during transport. This proposal seems to be reasonable as the active/interaction sites of the other larger propeller structures are also close to the pseudo-symmetry axes. In PFC [4], the haemopexin-like domain and the catalytic domain make contacts only along one edge, where the outermost strand of the first blade of the haemopexin propeller contacts the C-terminal helix of the catalytic domain (see Fig. 1). Both domains seem to be packed as individual entities in the crystal, whereas the connecting 17-residue linker is relatively loosely arranged. The authors suggest that the preferred domain arrangement of the full-length PFC in solution might be more flexible, and that its overall structure might differ from that seen in the crystal, in particular upon binding to triple-helical collagen. The probable modes of interaction of the homologous ddnains of the stromelysins remain to be determined; the experimental PFC structure nevertheless provides a valuable scaffold for structure-based mutagenesis studies to probe the involvement of particular sites in substrate or receptor binding. How the haemopexin-like domain of the collagenases and their endogenous catalytic domains work in concert to achieve specific cleavage of triple-helical collagen appears to be an even more complex phenomenon. None of the residues conserved in the haemopexin-like domains of the three known collagenases (i.e. MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13) is unique to this subfamily of MMPs. Li et al. [4] therefore propose that the specific triple-helical collagen recognition of the collagenase-derived haemopexin-like domain depends upon gross conformations of surface loops rather than on small surface changes attributable to single amino acid substitutions. In addition to the need for an intact and collagenase-like haemopexin-like domain [31,49], the capacity to cleave triple-helical collagen obviously depends on the correct interplay between the catalytic and haemopexin-like domains. This might be co-determined by the length and surface-guiding properties of the linker peptide, which, in the PFC structure, bulges backwards before it runs loosely across the 'lower' edge of the catalytic domain (Fig. 1). None of the interactions of the linker with the catalytic domain appear to be specific or designed. A possible scenario is that the haemopexin-like domain, with the linker fully stretched, will be positioned over the active site of the catalytic domain thereby sandwiching a triple-helical collagen substrate bound to its active site like a waffle in a waffle iron [16]. Such a concerted binding mode would considerably lengthen the encounter time, but alternatively (or additionally) the haemopexin domain could assist in destabilizing the triple-helical substrate. A full understanding of the detailed mechanism will have to await more experimental structures; however, this PFC structure represents a promising first step.
