Bivalent peptidic thrombin inhibitors consisting of an N-terminal D-cyclohexylalanine-Pro-Na(Me)Arg active-site fragment, a ¯exible polyglycine linker, and a C-terminal hirugen-like segment directed towards the ®brinogen recognition exosite inhibit thrombin with Ki values in the picomolar range, remaining stable in buffered solution at pH 7.8 for at least 15 hours. In order to investigate the structural basis of this increased stability, the most potent of these inhibitors, I-11 (Ki  37pM), containing an Na(Me)Arg-Thr bond, was crystallized in complex with human Ê a-thrombin. X-ray data were collected to 1.8 A resolution and the crystal structure of this complex was determined. The Fourier map displays clear electron density for the N-terminal fragment and for the exosite binding segment. It indicates, however, that in agreement with Edman sequencing, the peptide had been cleaved in the crystal, presumably due to the long incubation time of 14 days needed for crystallization and data collection. The Na(Me) group is directed toward the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ser214, pushing the Ser195 Og atom out of its normal site. This structure suggests that upon thrombin binding, the scissile peptide bond of the intact peptide and the Ser195 Og are separated from each other, impairing the nucleophilic attack of the Ser195 Og toward the Na(Me)Arg carbonyl group. In the time-scale of two weeks, however, cleavage geometries favoured by the crystal allow catalysis at a slow rate.

The serine proteinase thrombin plays a pivotal role in thrombosis and haemostasis, catalyzing several procoagulant processes that lead to clot formation.1,2 Thrombin has therefore been implicated in various disease processes, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism. A huge number of potent, small, synthetic thrombin inhibitors have been designed, synthesized and tested in the search for orally active anticoagulants.3,4 However, despite enormous efforts, so far there has been little success in making them available for clinical application. An alternative approach is the design of recombinant or synthetic

derivatives of naturally occurring peptidic inhibitors, like hirudin, a 65 amino acid residue peptide isolated originally from the leech Hirudo medicinalis.5 Hirudin uses a bivalent binding mode for potent and selective thrombin inhibition. The N-terminal three amino acid residues form a parallel b-sheet with residues Ser214-Gly216 adjacent to the active site of thrombin and, simultaneously, the C-terminal hirudin segment blocks the ®brinogen recognition exosite (FRE) of thrombin.6 In analogy to the small molecule inhibitor PPACK, the ®rst generation of synthetic bivalent peptide inhibitors derived from hirudin contained an N-terminal DPhe-Pro-Arg segment, which, in contrast to hirudin, forms a substrate-like antiparallel b-sheet within the thrombin active site.7,8 In order to reduce the rate of thrombin-catalysed inhibitor cleavage, it was essential to incorporate the imino

Fully stable compounds, however, required the incorporation of peptide bond analogs like ketomethylene groups9,10 or transition state mimetics;11 unfortunately, the synthesis of these compounds can be dif®cult and time-consuming. Similar high-af®nity thrombin inhibitors have been developed by replacing the DPhe-Pro-Arg sequence with other active-site segments derived from argatroban12 or NAPAP.13 It is known that peptides with a P1Pro residue are cleaved by only a few proteinases.14 This led us to the hypothesis that Na-methyl-arginine (Na(Me)Arg) would act as a combined ``Pro and Arg mimetic'' in the P1 position, yielding stable peptide mimetics with high af®nity. In a previous publication,15 we reported the synthesis, af®nity and speci®city of a series of 11 compounds containing the P1-Na(Me)Arg residue and optimized sequences for active-site and FRE binding. The peptide with the lowest 1 Ki (I-11 with the sequence DCha-Proa 10 N (Me)Arg5Thr-(Gly)5- Asp-Tyr-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro(Glu)2-Ala-Cha-20DGlu; Ki  37 pM) contained a a DCha-Pro-N (Me)Arg segment at the unprimed side, a Thr in P1H position, a ¯exible glycine linker, and a C-terminal FRE binding sequence derived from the exosite inhibitor MDL28,050.16 This compound is selective, with the serine proteinases trypsin, factor Xa and urokinase not being inhibited (Ki > 1 mM), while plasmin is inhibited weakly (Ki = 0.2 mM). I-11 was found to be fully stable in buffered a-thrombin solutions for at least 15 hours.15 Similar compounds with Arg-Pro as P1-P1H segment, in contrast, were nearly fully degraded under these conditions. In order to understand the structural reasons for this high level of stability, we have co-crystallized

I-11 with human a-thrombin in space group C2 and have determined the crystal structure of this Ê complex at 1.8 A resolution. With the exception of the 149-loop (chymotrypsinogen numbering of thrombin19), the main chain of the thrombin molecule is fully de®ned by electron density, exhibiting a conformation virtually identical with that seen in the thrombin-hirulog 1 complex. The inhibitor, in contrast, can be traced for only the three N-terminal residues and the C-terminal 10 Asp-19Cha segment, which interacts with the FRE in a manner similar to that observed for related thrombin structures.11,18 The electron density break in the inhibitor chain after Na(Me)Arg (Figure 1) could be explained either by disorder in the 4Thr(Gly)5 linker or by chain cleavage, with the planar Ê 1.8 A density accounting for an internal carboxamide group after P1-Na(Me)Arg or a C-terminal carboxylate (see Figure 2(a)). Subsequent N-terminal sequencing revealed a peptide starting with Thr, which is present in the crystals at a ratio of about 1:1 with the Ile-Val-Glu-Gly N terminus of a-thrombin. Thus, all evidence indicates that the peptide has been cleaved fully at the Na(Me)ArgThr peptide bond after 14 days. The free N terminus of 1dCha forms hydrogen bonds with Gly216 O and with several water molecules (Figure 2(a)). The cyclohexyl ring of dCha, ®xed in the boat conformation, unlike in a related structure11 that showed a chair conformation, slots into the hydrophobic aryl pocket of thrombin, while the pryrrolidine ring of the P2-2Pro extends into the characteristic S2 pocket in a manner similar to, but not as far as, that observed in PPACK-thrombin19 (Figure 2(b)). The P1-3Na(Me)Arg residue, in contrast, is placed considerably farther away from the active Ser195 residue, so that its side-chain does not extend into the S1 pocket in the usually

The hydrogen atom of Ne is directed toward the back of the S1 pocket, however, where it binds a Ê water molecule (Wat60, 2.8 A), in contrast to the other known structures with a P1-Arg residue (Figure 1). The Na(Me) group is accommodated in

a surface groove formed by the carbonyl group of Ê Ser214 (at a distance of 3.0 A) and Cb of Ser195. The Ser195 side-chain is in gauche(À) conformation (w1   80  ), with the Og atom pushed towards the Ê Cys42Ð Cys58 disulphide bond, where it is 3.7 A Ê away from the N-methyl group, and 3.5 A from both 3Na(Me)Arg carboxylate oxygen atoms (Figure 1). The temperature factor (B) of the Og Ê atom (18 A2) is signi®cantly higher than that of the Ê other Ser195 atoms ($12 A2), indicating some mobility towards the scissile peptide bond. It forms hydrogen bonds to the Ne2 of His57 and two ®xed solvent molecules. In addition to obtaining information about the interactions within the thrombin-I-11 complex, the

Human prothrombin, puri®ed according to standard procedures22 from citrated human plasma obtained from Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz (Wiesenthaid, Germany), was activated to a-thrombin with Oxyuranus scutellatus venom23 (Latoxan, France) and puri®ed to homogeneity. The synthesis of the I-11 peptide has been described.15 Crystals were obtained by co-crystallization of I-11 and thrombin using sitting drop methods: 1.5 ml of a solution containing 5 mg/ml of human a-thrombin and a sixfold molar excess of I-11 in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM NaCl were mixed with 1.5 ml of a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 5.6) and 20 % (w/v) PEG6000 as precipitant. Monoclinic crystals of space group C2 appeared after two days of concentration against the reservoir. The crystals were transferred to the mother solution containing 20 % (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant, and were mounted under a nitrogen stream (100 K) on an MAR345 image plate system (MAR Research, Hamburg). A complete X-ray data set was taken from a single crystal. The data were processed with the MOSFLM package,24 and scaled and loaded using SCALA from the CCP4 program suite.25 The orientation and position of the thrombin molecules were determined with the program AMoRe,26 using data from 20 Ê to 3.5 A resolution and the modi®ed thrombin-hirulog 3 complex18 as a search model. A unique solution with a correlation factor of 59.4 % and an R factor of 36.2 % was found. The crystallographic re®nement was done in several cycles, consisting of model-building steps performed with MAIN,27 and conjugate gradient minimization and simulated annealing using CNS.28 The target parameters of Engh & Huber29 were used. Finally, solvent molecules were built in and individual, restrained atomic B values were re®ned. The occupancy of atoms not de®ned by electron density was set to zero. All main-chain angles are located in the most favoured and favoured f,c regions. The atomic coordinates have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the code 1EB1.

primary aim of this work was to ®nd out whether the methylation of the P1 amino acid is of general interest for the design of stable mimetics of serine proteinase substrates and inhibitors, which would be especially useful for structure analysis of their primed region. However, the crystal structure (in agreement with Edman degradation results, which showed four N termini for the thrombin light and heavy chains and for the two cleavage products) revealed that under long-term incubation the Na(Me)Arg-Xaa peptide bond is not fully resistant to hydrolysis by thrombin. This is in apparent contradiction to the previously reported HPLC diagrams.15 In the related thrombin-hirulog 1 complex, with P1-Arg and P1H -Pro, cleavage is observed even in solution17. Hirulog 3, carrying a P1-b-homoArg and P1H -Gly, was stable against

thrombin hydrolysis in solution and when bound in the thrombin crystals, with electron density present for nearly the entire inhibitor chain, including the intact ``scissile'' peptide bond.18 The additional methylene group of b-homoArg inserted between Ca and the carbonyl group obviously moves the peptide group out of phase to such an extent that cleavage becomes impossible even at the tight binding conditions within the crystal (Figure 2(a)). The present structure gives a probable explanation for the highly reduced reactivity of the Na(Me)ArgXaa bond in these compounds. By binding with its dCha-Pro-Na(Me)Arg moiety and the C-terminal segment into the non-primed subsites and the FRE, respectively, the Na(Me)Arg-Xaa bond of the bifunctional inhibitor is tethered across the Ser195 side-chain. The additional steric hindrance of the

Na(Me) group prevents the tight approach of the P1 nitrogen atom to the Ser214 carbonyl group (believed to be necessary for catalysis21) and of the scissile peptide bond to the active site (compare with PPACK in Figure 2(b)). Simultaneously, the Na(Me) group pushes the Ser195 Og out of its normal site that is productive for catalysis, corresponding to a w1 rotation from about À70  (gauche()) to 80  (gauche(À)), which is incompatible with peptide cleavage (Figure 1). This is unlikely to be due to the newly formed carboxylate group, since, in the case of the similarly cleaved thrombin-hirulog 1 complex,17 the Ser195 Og is in the normal À70  conformation. Rarely, under the restraining crystal conditions, the Ser195 side-chain might rotate and approach close enough to the scissile peptide bond for successful nucleophilic attack, resulting in the cleavage of the Na(Me)ArgXaa bond. The increased B factor of the Ser195 Og atom compared with other Ser195 atoms supports this hypothesis. In solution, such an event appears to be extremely improbable, rendering this peptide bond suf®ciently stable for practical use, particularly because peptides anyway exhibit relatively short half-life periods in the body (in the minute range). In the crystals, in contrast, the scissile peptide bond and the ¯anking peptide segments may be ®xed tighter due to the crystal packing, so that the extremely rare successful cleavage events would occur more frequently. The present study elucidates the molecular basis for the improved stability of these bifunctional Na(Me)Arg inhibitors. The synthesis of these peptides is convenient compared with the enormous efforts necessary for insertion of pseudo-peptide bonds, making these new Na(Me)Arg inhibitors particularly promising for further development. A feasible modi®cation could be to use sterically more demanding alkyl groups instead of Na(Me), leading presumably to higher stability but lower af®nity.
