1. Introduction Two very recent independent reports [1,2] describe the synthesis of the first example of a 1,2,4-selenadiphosphole, P2SeC2But 1, whose formulation was 2 mainly based on elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopic data. Compond 1, which can be made (i) by treatment of the 1,2,4-triphosphole P3C2But CH(SiMe3)2 2 with Se8; (ii) from the reaction between ButCP and the 1,2,3-selena diazole C2H2N2Se; and (iii) by treating a DME solution of LiSbP2C2But with Se(S2CNEt2)2, [3] 2 is a yellow oil and no structural data are available on this novel type of aromatic [4] ring system. We now describe the solid state structures of Cr and W pen* Corresponding author. Tel.: +44-273-678536; fax: + 44-273677196. E-mail address: j.nixon@sussex.ac.uk (J.F. Nixon)

tacarbonyl metal complexes of 1 which establish the geometry of the 1,2,4-selenadiphosphole ring. We also report the structure of the corresponding 1,2,4-telluradiphosphole-W(CO)5 complex.

2. Results and discussion Treatment of a THF solution of 1 with [M(CO)5THF] (M = Cr, W) followed by column chromatography gave the yellow complexes [M(CO)5-P2SeC2But ] M = Cr 2, and M = W 3, in 36 and 27% 2 yield, respectively (Scheme 1). The mode of attachment of the [M(CO)5] fragment to the 1,2,4-selenadiphosphole ring was established as being via the phosphorus P(A) atom bonded directly to selenium. The 31P{1H}-NMR spectrum of both 2 and 3 shows a pattern of lines typical for an [AB] spin system with satellites due to further coupling to the 77Se nu-

cleus (I=1/2, 7.58%). Chemical shift and coupling constant data for 1, 2 and 3 are listed in Section 3. Additional evidence for the proposed structures of 3 comes from its 77Se-NMR spectrum which shows a doublet of doublets pattern and the observation of tungsten satellites (183W, I =1/2, 14.40%) around the resonance of P(A). The magnitude of the 1JP(A)W coupling constant lies in the expected range for complexes containing an h1-ligated [W(CO)5] fragment (234 ­ 276 Hz) [5,6]. As expected, 1H-NMR spectra of complexes 2 and 3 each show two resonances corresponding to the different types of But groups. Infrared spectra of compounds 2 and 3 in the wCO stretching region consist of three bands and data are comparable with those for other closely related complexes of azaphospholes [6]. Further evidence supporting the formulation of both 2 and 3 is the observation in their mass spectra of the expected parent ions at m/z= 472 and 604, respectively and peaks corresponding to loss of two, four and five CO groups

(m/z= 416, 360, and 332 for 2) and (m/z= 548, 492, and 464 for 3) as well as a peak at m/z= 280 for 1. Suitable single crystals of 2 and 3 were grown from a hexane solution, and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies established their molecular structures (Figs. 1 and 2), and confirm the structures proposed from the solution NMR data. Both 2 and 3 exhibit a planar P2SeC2But ring and some equalisation of the ring bond 2 lengths expected for an aromatic selenadiphosphole ring system. The ring angles at carbon are close to 120° while those at P or Se are closer to 100° and the ring geometry is essentially independent of the nature of the [M(CO)5] fragment to which it is attached (see Table 1). The Se­P and Se­C bond lengths (a) and (e) for 2 and 3 are significantly shorter than Se­P and Se­C single ° bonds (2.273 and 1.972 A, respectively), [7] and are in good agreement with values obtained from theoretical calculations on ring systems 4­6 [4], suggesting that the ring geometry of 1 may be very similar to that in 2 and 3.

The relative stabilities of the two possible h1-Pbonded chromium pentacarbonyl complexes were calculated at the HF/3-21G(*) and at the B3LYP/3-21G(*)

level of the theory1, and at both levels the preferred site is the P4 position rather than that found in 2. However, the energy difference is quite small between the isomeric structures (1.5, 1.6 and 3.1 kcal mol - 1, respectively at the HF/3-21G(*), B3LYP/3-21G(*) and B3LYP/6-311 +G**//B3LYP/3-21G(*) levels). Attachment of But groups to both ring C atoms changes the relative stabilities of the two complexes at the B3LYP/ 3-21G* level and complex 2 is more stable by 6.5 kcal mol - 1 in accord with the experimental data. The different relative stabilities of the H and the But substituted complexes presumably can be attributed to steric congestion. The calculated structural parameters of the ring in the different complexes (excluding the But substituents) are compared in Table 2 together with the data for the hypothetical (P2SeC2H2) 1% and the experimental data for 2. It can be seen that the bond lengths do not change significantly upon complexation, likewise the position of attachment of the ring to Cr has little

Geometry optimisation was carried out at the HF/3-21G(*) level, followed by the calculation of the second derivatives on the optimised structure. This calculation proved that a real minimum was obtained on the potential energy surface. Further optimisation was then performed at the B3LYP/3-21G(*) level.

The new 1,2,4-telluradiphosphole P2TeC2But 7 which 2 was made from LiSbP2C2But and Te(S2CNEt2)2 [3], 2 was converted into its yellow [W(CO)5] adduct 8 (40%) (Scheme 2) and detailed 1H-, 31P- and 125Te-NMR spectroscopic studies on the latter established an analogous structure to 2 and 3. This was subsequently confirmed by a single crystal X-ray analysis of 8 whose molecular structure is shown in Fig. 3. The P­W bond distances in 3 and 8 are

almost identical and the overall geometry of the planar 1,2,4-telluradiphosphole ring in 8 is very similar to that of the 1,2,4-selenadiphosphole ring in 2 and 3, with the ° expected lengthening of the Te ­ C 2.067(4)A and Te­P ° distances (2.378(2)A compared with their Se analogues and a narrowing of the CTeP angle (90.9°) in 8 compared with the corresponding CSeP angle (96.2° in 2 and 95.9° in 3)). In all three complexes 2, 3 and 8 the sum of the angles at the P atom coordinated to the metal centre is as expected very close to 360°.
