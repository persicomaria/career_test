Transmembrane Domain Mediated Self-assembly of Major Coat Protein Subunits from Ff Bacteriophage
Roman A. Melnyk, Anthony W. Partridge and Charles M. Deber*
Division of Structural Biology and Biochemistry. Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada M5G 1X8; Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 1A8 Ontario, Canada The 50-residue major coat protein (MCP) of Ff bacteriophage exists as a single-spanning membrane protein in the Escherichia coli host inner membrane prior to assembly into lipid-free virions. Here, the molecular bases for the speci®city and stoichiometry that govern the protein-protein interactions of MCP in the host membrane are investigated in detergent micelles. To address these structural issues, as well as to circumvent viability requirements in mutants of the intact protein, peptides corresponding to the effective a-helical TM segment of wild-type and mutant bacteriophage MCPs were synthesized. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments on the dansyl and dabcyl-labeled MCP TM domain peptides in detergent micelles demonstrated that the peptides speci®cally associate into non-covalent homodimers, as postulated for the biologically relevant membrane-embedded MCP oligomer. MCP peptides labeled with short-range pyrene ¯uorophores at the N terminus displayed excimer ¯uorescence consistent with homodimerization occurring in a parallel fashion. Variant peptides synthesized with single substitutions at helix-interactive positions displayed a wide range of dimer/ monomer ratios on SDS-PAGE gels, which are interpreted in terms of steric volume, presence or absence of b-branching, and the effect of polar substituents. The overall results indicate discrete roles for helix-helix interfacial residues as packing recognition elements in the membraneinserted state, and suggest a possible correlation between phage viability and ef®cacy of MCP TM-TM interactions.

contain a single-stranded circular DNA genome that is encapsulated by $2700 copies of the 50-residue major coat protein (MCP) encoded by gene VIII. The primary sequence of the MCP is identical for both fd and f1 phage, and differs in M13 by a single Asp to Asn exchange at position 12. Upon infection of E. coli, the phage particle disassembles, with the MCP becoming stably inserted in the bacterial inner membrane while the single-stranded viral DNA is released into the cytosol.2,3 Membrane-embedded MCP has been shown to speci®cally self-associate into dimers in both detergent micelles and lipid bilayers by a series of in vitro experiments using various biophysical techniques.4 ± 9 Also, in vivo cross-linking studies revealed that MCP subunits from f1 phage speci®cally paired in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.10 This homodimerization may serve to facilitate the organization of MCP subunits onto the extruding phage DNA prior to exit from the

Using a combination of randomized and saturation mutagenesis experiments, in conjunction with SDS-PAGE and thermal denaturation assays we previously demonstrated that the self-association of full-length M13 MCP is sensitive to mutations located on one face of the transmembrane a-helix.7,11,12 Several of the viable mutations were found to affect the monomer-dimer ratio, by either stabilizing the monomeric state or the dimeric state or, in certain cases, higher-order oligomers.7,11 This approach, which resulted in a library of viable mutants covering much of the coat protein sequence, provided insight into the nature of the protein-protein interactions of the MCP in the membrane. In particular, mutagenesis results led to the identi®cation of a putative dimeric interface within the core of the TM domain based on the ``two-in-two-out'' motif: VVxxGAxxGI, where x positions were reasoned to be lipidfacing due to the benign effect of mutations on these residues on dimerization.7 The VV, GA, and GI residues provide the ``knobs'' and ``holes'' at the helix-interactive face that act as recognition elements, which dictate the speci®city and stability of the MCP homodimer. The requirement for phage viability in production of these MCP mutants, however, signi®cantly limited the number of mutations that could be investigated in the TM domain as it became apparent that certain residues were non-mutable, while others were limited to restrictions conservative mutations.12 These imposed by phage viability also precluded the deletion of the N-terminal arm in order to study the TM domain in isolation. As a result, it could not be determined how each domain contributes to the energetics and speci®city of MCP dimerization. In the present work, peptide versions of the MCP (MCPpeptide) lacking the N-terminal arm were synthesized in order to investigate directly the role of the transmembrane domain in MCP dimeri-

zation. The mutation-dependent speci®city and stoichiometry of association of the TM peptides, including those with residues previously unobtainable by mutagenesis, were initially examined. The a-helical MCPpeptide was found to speci®cally associate as dimers in SDS micelles using both SDS-PAGE and ¯uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. In parallel analyses, MCPpeptides were found to be sensitive to mutations located at the dimer interface similarly to those observed for the MCP. The synthetic peptide approach outlined here serves to supplement previous work using the MCP9,12 by bypassing the requirements for phage viability, as well as to provide new biophysical information regarding the details of MCP helix-helix association. As well, through comparison of results with MCP, the opportunity arises to assess any role of the absent N-terminal amphipathic a-helix and on MCP dimerization.

Results and Discussion
Peptide design To ensure that the entire a-helical transmembrane domain from MCP was included in the ®nal peptide design, the NMR solution structures of the fd and M13 major coat proteins in SDS detergent micelles were considered.13 ± 15 The solution structures were similar, and in M13 revealed the presence of an N-terminal amphipathic a-helix extending from residues 8 to 16 connected by a distorted helical hinge region, to the micelleembedded hydrophobic a-helix consisting of residues 25 to 45 (Figure 1(a)). In the present design, residues 21 to 48 were included, along with three non-native N-terminal lysine residues, in the TM peptide design (Figure 1(b)). We have previously demonstrated that terminal Lys residues on hydrophobic TM segments aid in the overall solubility of the peptides without affecting the ability of peptides to associate to their native-like oligomeric states.16 Indeed, we found that all synthetic

65 utility of micelles as membrane mimics, the assessment of TM helix-helix interactions by SDS-PAGE was employed successfully to identify a putative oligomeric interface of the glycophorin A homodimer, which was later con®rmed by the high-resolution NMR structure solved in detergent micelles.31 Furthermore, the structure of glycophorin A in membrane bilayers solved using magicangle spinning NMR spectroscopy32 revealed that although there were differences in detail, the overall structural determinants of association were similar in both membrane environments. The relevance of micelles is further illustrated by the signi®cant correlation between mutagenesis results in detergent micelles33,34 to accumulating data being obtained in the ToxR system used to monitor TM helix-helix interactions in lipid bilayers.35,36 The oligomeric state of full-length wild-type M13 MCP on SDS-PAGE has been variously reported as monomers37,38 or dimers4,5,7,8,39 depending on the conditions used for analysis (such as relative peptide/detergent concentrations). In our hands, WT MCP migrated as a ``smear'' between that of a monomer and dimer,7,11 a result that may re¯ect an equilibrium between the two states on the timescale of the gel experiment. The WT MCPpeptide synthesized here migrated as two species characteristic of monomer and dimer, with most of the peptide migrating in the dimeric state depending on the particular gel system used for analysis (Figure 3). In lane 2, WT MCPpeptide was run on a 12 % (w/v) bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel at 200 V constant, and displays a smear between the dimeric and monomeric forms of the TM peptide. In lane 3, WT MCPpeptide monomer and dimer become well separated as distinct species when run on a 16 % Tris-tricine gel at 125 V constant.

MCPpeptides were rendered soluble in pure water as a result of the addition of three N-terminal Lys residues to the N terminus. Peptides were determined to be >95 % pure by peak integration on an analytical C4 HPLC column. Characterization of WT peptide secondary and tertiary structure Prior to assessing the oligomeric state of the MCPpeptides, it was necessary to establish that the peptides lacking the N-terminal amphipathic arm formed stable a-helices in detergent micelles. Using far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), the secondary structure of WT MCPpeptide was measured in SDS detergent micelles (Figure 2). The a-helical content was estimated to be ca 60 %, based on the value of the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm.17 The fractional helicity observed by CD was that expected for these peptides in which 18 to 21 of the 31 residues (58 to 67 % of the total peptide) should constitute the a-helix that inserts into the detergent micelle. All MCPpeptides gave similar CD spectra with minima near 208 nm and 222 nm characteristic of a-helical polypeptides. The self-assembly of the MCPpeptides was initially characterized in SDS detergent micelles using SDSPAGE. This method has been extensively used to examine the association of transmembrane domains, since certain highly stable helix-helix interactions have been shown to persist in SDS detergent micelles.7,16,18 ± 30 To underscore the

Figure 3. SDS-PAGE analysis of WT MCPpeptide. Peptides were dissolved in SDS-containing sample buffer and boiled for ®ve minutes prior to electrophoresis using either 4-12 % NuPAGE (lane 2) or 16 % Tricine (lane 3) gels. Conditions for electrophoresis were 200V constant voltage, and 125V constant voltage, respectively.

66 The results with the present MCPpeptides represent the initial observation that the MCP TM domain per se is capable of associating as a dimer on SDS-PAGE in the absence of the N-terminal amphipathic a-helix of the full-length protein. Shorter peptide versions of the MCP consisting of residues 24 to 44, ¯anked by lysine residues, while unable to form SDS-resistant dimers, similarly displayed non-covalent helix-helix association in lysophospholipids.9 With the results presented here, the importance of the peptide segment length on the ef®cacy of transmembrane oligomer formation becomes apparent. Suf®cient length is required not only to ensure inclusion of all interfacial residues, but also to guard against the possibility of the juxtaposition of polar/charged terminal residues with the interactive face of the dimer. This situation arose in the single-spanning, SDS-resistant dimer glycophorin A, where it was shown that deletion of C-terminal residues that were not at the helixhelix interface mitigates against dimerization on SDS-PAGE.40 Direct comparison of the present SDS-PAGE results between the WT MCP and the WT MCPpeptide suggests that, based on the relative populations of monomer and dimer, the MCPpeptide may qualitatively have higher dimerization af®nities than the corresponding MCP itself. This phenomenon may derive from the motional freedom of the N-terminal arm that was observed in NMR experiments of both M13 and fd MCPs.13 ± 15,41 15N NMR relaxation studies showed that relative to the TM domain, the residues of the amphipathic helix have increased motional freedom, an indication that the N-terminal helix moves on and off the micellar surface. These workers suggested that the motion of the amphipathic helix may be the basis for the transition of the MCP in the membrane-bound form to that in phage particle. We propose here that this motion may also serve as a means to reduce the overall dimer af®nity, thereby facilitating the subsequent dimer dissociation required prior to phage assembly and extrusion. The results obtained here establishing the dimeric nature of the WT MCPpeptide in detergent micelles also support those found previously with the M13 MCP in phospholipid bilayers and sodium cholate micelles using site-speci®c spin labeling techniques, where coat proteins were similarly found to be dimeric below pH 8.8 Labeling and characterizing MCPpeptides with probes for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been used to measure self-association of both soluble and TM a-helices by monitoring the transfer of energy from excited donor-labeled subunits to acceptor-labeled subunits.42 ± 46 The N-terminal labeled donor-acceptor pair used here to characterize the association of MCPpeptides consisted of dansyl (donor) and dabcyl (acceptor), where dansyl is

¯uorescent, but dabcyl is not. This donor-acceptor pair has been used previously in similar applications to assess the oligomerization of the transmembrane a-helices gramicidin A, glycophorin A and phospholamban.42,43,46 FRET occurs through the radiationless, dipole-dipole interaction between the probes that depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance between the donor and acceptor.47 Energy transfer is evidenced by the quenching of the dansyl relative ¯uorescence yield by dabcyl when the proteins to which they are attached oligomerize. Speci®c labeling of MCPpeptide was achieved during synthesis by attaching an e-(dansyl or dabcyl)-a-FMOC-L-Lys residue to the N terminus (Figure 1(b)). Labeled peptides were cleaved from the resin and puri®ed using the same protocols as for unlabeled peptides (see Materials and Methods). This technique of sample preparation ensures that labeling is both speci®c and complete. Both dansyl and dabcyl-labeled MCPpeptides were retained longer than corresponding unlabeled peptides in the RP-HPLC column, allowing for ef®cient isolation of pure labeled peptides. The absorption spectrum of MCPpeptide-dabcyl overlaps the ¯uorescence emission spectrum of MCPpeptidedansyl (excited at 341 nm), a prerequisite for FRET to occur. The effects, if any, on the secondary and tertiary structure on labeled MCPpeptides were assessed to ensure that the labels did not impact upon peptide conformation and/or dimerization. CD spectra recorded for dansyl-labeled and dabcyl-labeled MCPpeptides revealed that the helical content of the labeled peptides was ca 60 % for each peptide, virtually identical with that for the unlabeled form. In SDS-PAGE analysis, the labels did not affect the homodimerization, as the relative amounts of monomer and dimer were the same for both labeled WT MCPpeptides as for unlabeled WT MCPpeptide (data not shown). To ensure that the association of MCPpeptides was speci®c and not a result of adventitious association between peptides in the same micelle, ¯uorescence spectra were recorded in the presence of unlabeled WT MCPpeptide and a control peptide (G34I) known to be monomeric on SDS-PAGE (vide infra). Figure 4(a) shows that addition of unlabeled WT MCPpeptide, equimolar with respect to the total concentration of dansyl  dabcyl-labeled peptides, resulted in a $50 % reduction in FRET, indicating that peptides have equilibrated and association is not affected speci®cally by the labels.23 In contrast, Figure 4(b) shows that the addition of monomeric G34I peptide did not alter FRET between donor and acceptor labeled peptides. Together these results establish that the labeled and unlabeled peptides were able to equilibrate and that MCPpeptide dimerization is speci®c. Throughout these experiments, the molar ratio of detergent to peptide was maintained at 2000:1 or $20-30 micelles per peptide, a ratio that guards against adventitious association of peptides.

67 mine the stoichiometry of association for an oligomer.42,43,45 In the case of a monomer, where there is no association, no quenching should be observed as the mole fraction of dabcyl groups is increased. For a dimer, the relative quantum yield of the donor decreases linearly with the mole fraction of the acceptor according to the relation F/Fo  1 À Ea, where E is the transfer ef®ciency within a hybrid, and a is the mole fraction acceptor.42 In Figure 5, the plot of ef®ciency of energy transfer versus the mole fraction of acceptor for the MCPpeptide oligomer yielded a linear relationship that ®t to a straight line (R2  0.989), con®rming that the MCPpeptide oligomer is a dimer. Excimer fluorescence reveals MCPpeptides form parallel homodimers To assess whether MCPpeptides homodimers were parallel or antiparallel, short-range pyrene ¯uorescent probes were attached to a Cys residue engineered between the N-terminal Lys-tag and the WT MCPpeptide TM segment (Figure 1). Cyscontaining WT MCPpeptide was then labeled with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide, and subsequently puri®ed away from unlabeled peptide using HPLC. In addition to emitting ¯uorescence from the excited monomer state, pyrene can form an excited-state

In curve c, the quenching of ¯uorescence by the dabcyl-labeled MCPpeptide is competed out by unlabeled WT MCPpeptide by $50 %. Panel B: an experiment similar to that shown in panel A, except that curve c (which overlaps with curve b) represents the ¯uorescence spectrum resulting from a mixture comprised of donor:acceptor:unlabeled G34I MCPpeptide (1:1:2). The G34I MCPpeptide acts as a control monomeric peptide (see the text) which, as shown by curve c, cannot compete out the FRET effect observed for the 1:1 WT-dansyl  WT-dabcyl mixture. Figure 5. Relative ¯uorescence quantum yield of donor WT-dansyl-labeled MCPpeptide in the presence of increasing mole fractions of WT-dabcyl MCPpeptide acceptor. WT-dansyl-labeled MCPpeptide concentration was maintained at 1 mM as the mole fraction of WTdabcyl MCPpeptide was increased. The total peptide concentration was maintained at 5 mM in each sample using unlabeled WT MCPpeptide. Experiments were conducted in 10 mM SDS, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 20 mM NaCl. Similar results were obtained when peptides were either mixed ®rst in water or when peptides were mixed in SDS detergent. Peptides were incubated for two hours prior to ¯uorescence measurements.

Confirmation of oligomer stoichiometry using FRET To con®rm that the oligomerization state of MCPpeptides was dimeric, a set of FRET experiments was performed between donor-labeled dansyl peptides and acceptor dabcyl-labeled peptides. By measuring the relative ¯uorescence yield of donor dansyl MCPpeptide as a function of the amount of acceptor dabcyl MCPpeptide, it is possible to deter-

68 dimer or ``excimer'' when two pyrene molecules Ê stack within $3.5 A of each other.48 The two peaks corresponding to the monomer ¯uorescence emission are in the range 380-400 nm, and the broad excimer ¯uorescence peak is in the range 480490 nm.49 The short distances required to achieve excimer ¯uorescence have been utilized to establish the proximity of Cys residues in both soluble and transmembrane proteins.49 ± 56 Here, pyrene-labeled WT MCPpeptide (6 mM) in SDS detergent micelles excited at 341 nm displayed a signi®cant excimer peak at $480 nm, the presence of which indicates close proximity of the two N termini in the homodimer (Figure 6). This result suggests that MCPpeptide homodimers are aligned in a parallel fashion in SDS micelles, since pyrene probes would be too widely separated to give rise to excimer ¯uorescence if peptides formed antiparallel homodimers. To investigate whether a greater amount of dimer, and therefore excimer relative to monomer could be obtained, we investigated association of MCPpeptide under the less-denaturing detergent conditions of sodium per¯uorooctanoate (PFO). PFO detergent micelles have been found to be a more permissive environment than SDS micelles56,57 for transmembrane segment oligomerization. The signi®cant increase in excimer ¯uorescence seen in PFO versus SDS shown in Figure 6 illustrates the non-disruptive nature of PFO micelles on MCPpeptide dimerization. Consistent with these excimer results, the enhanced dimerization of WT MCPpeptide was further illustrated on PFO-PAGE,57 where the WT MCPpeptide exists exclusively in the dimeric form compared to a mixture of dimer and monomer on SDS-PAGE

(Figure 6, inset). These excimer experiments do not exclude the possibility that there also exist populations of antiparallel homodimers and/or other loosely associated parallel homodimers. However, due to the high stability and speci®city required to form the observed SDS-resistant oligomers, the likelihood of alternate orientations contributing signi®cantly to monomer/dimer equilbria would be regarded as remote, both in the present work and in other systems.18,20,22,27,30 MCPpeptide homodimerization is sensitive to interfacial mutations Previous work in our laboratory on the MCP demonstrated that certain Val 3 Ala mutations selectively altered the packing of the TM domain of MCP.7 In particular, Val31 was proposed to reside at the dimer interface and was thus selected here to investigate whether the MCPpeptide homodimer was sensitive to interfacial point mutations. Accordingly, a series of MCPpeptides was synthesized in which Val31 was replaced individually with a series of amino acids having a variety of side-chain characteristics (Ile, Ala, Leu, Gly, and Asp). Con®rmation of dimer stoichiometry for WT MCPpeptide by FRET affords the opportunity to use SDS-PAGE analysis to determine the population(s) of monomeric and/or dimeric states stabilized in mutant constructs. CD spectroscopy demonstrated that for each point mutation, there was no appreciable effect on secondary structure (not shown), con®rming that any structural alterations arising from point mutations involves the ef®cacy of packing of TM segments. The results from SDS-PAGE gel and band densitometry analyses of several V31 positional mutant peptides are presented in Figure 7. Densitometry measurements showed that replacement of Val by Ile maintains the WT MCPpeptide dimer/monomer ratio, indicating that residue b-branching is an important determinant of helix-helix af®nity. This notion is reinforced by the further observation that both Ala and Leu tend to stabilize the helix dimer (versus WT MCPpeptide), despite the fact that Ala occupies signi®cantly less side-chain volume than Val. These observations are in agreement with results obtained previously on full-length M13 MCP, where it was found that the viable mutants V31A7 and V31L (Z. Li., M. Glibowicka & C.M.D., this laboratory, unpublished results) stabilized the dimeric state relative to WT (viz. an increase of about 15 %). Our results with Ala and Leu mutant peptides suggest that non-b-branched aliphatic residues promote hydrophobic interfacial clustering but also allow closer approach of helical backbones due to increased steric ¯exibility around the b-carbon locus. This latter effect is further supported by the result that the V31G MCPpeptide, a mutant that could not be obtained in mutagenesis protocols on the full-length MCP, displayed the greatest degree of dimerization (ca 90 %) among the V31 mutants examined. Likely, the packing-

69 brane, likely owing to the necessity of maintaining the dynamic properties of the MCP during its transient insertion in the host E. coli inner membrane. Biological aspects of dimer affinity in the membrane environment As certain MCPpeptide mutants (not previously obtainable in randomized mutagenesis protocols with MCP) displayed signi®cantly different dimer populations relative to WT MCPpeptide, we considered the implications of this result for ®lamentous phage biology. In general, single nucleotide changes to a given codon in a randomized mutagenesis protocol are expected to arise with the highest frequency. With the Val31 position in MCP possessing the WT gtc codon, there are nine such single nucleotide change possibilities, which give rise to six different amino acid changes: V31A, V31G, V31L, V31F, V31D and V31I, provided all mutants are viable. However, while mutants with A, L, and I residues were obtained at this position, residues that did not arise from such a single nucleotide change at position 31 were D, G, and F. The ®nding that both V31G and V31D peptides differed most widely from WT MCPpeptide with respect to dimer af®nity suggests that transmembrane protein-protein interactions may play a role in determining phage viability. To amplify our studies in this regard, we synthesized a series of peptide variants at position G34. Previously, G34A and G34S were the only two viable mutants obtainable at this position for full-length MCP.12 Consistent with the above ®ndings, G34A and G34S MCPpeptide monomer/dimer ratios were not signi®cantly altered relative to WT MCPpeptide. In contrast, the ``non-viable'' peptide mutant G34V, (which can arise from a single nucleotide change in the MCP) abrogated dimer formation, displaying only monomer on gels (not shown). A further mutant peptide, G34I, was also monomeric on SDS-PAGE, although obtaining this mutant in mutagenesis protocols would have required a double nucleotide change. Together, these results imply that the ef®cacy of WT MCP protein-protein interactions while the protein is situated in the E. coli inner membrane may have a direct impact upon the life-cycle of the phage. However, one must note that these and other sites within the effective TM segment of MCP may also participate speci®cally in the protein-protein and/or proteinDNA interactions, which characterize the intact M13 virion.

For each mutant, the % dimer was quanti®ed using band densitometry measurements averaged from ®ve individual gel experiments identical with that shown in (a).

promoting role attributed to the relative preponderance of glycine in protein TM segments is operative here, where the small Gly residue permits the tightest dimer to form. In contrast, an Asp residue placed at the interface eliminates dimer formation, indicating a decisive role for side-chain polarity at the interface; thus situated, the Asp side-chain may distort the dimer interface in attempts to interact with a polar partner such as a backbone peptide carbonyl group. To ensure that the migration of the Asp mutation was not an artifact of SDS micelles, a similar peptide synthesized in which an Asp residue replaced the non-interfacial residue V29. In contrast to V31D, the V29D peptide displayed a dimer/monomer band ratio on SDSPAGE nearly identical with WT MCPpeptide (data not shown). It appears from the results obtained here and previously7 that the Val residue at position 31 plays a crucial role in modulating the degree of association of the MCP homodimer. The present ®ndings support the idea that the b-branched residue-rich mid-section of the MCPpeptide segment (Val-Val-Val-Ile-Val) likely operates to destabilize the MCP dimer in the mem-

Conclusions
Using synthetic peptides of the Ff phage major coat protein, we demonstrate that the isolated TM domain of the protein is capable of folding into a-helices and associating into parallel dimers, independent of the amphipathic N-terminal arm. These results extend observations that MCPpeptides retain

70 the oligomeric states, which they produce in the corresponding intact proteins.16 The synthetic strategy utilized here allowed us to uniquely label and isolate MCP peptides for FRET experiments that served to both demonstrate the speci®city, and con®rm the oligomeric state, of the MCP dimers. The fact that WT MCPpeptide tends to favor the dimeric state versus the corresponding WT MCP prompts us to propose that the N-terminal arm may speci®cally destabilize the dimeric state in vivo perhaps as a means to facilitate extrusion of the phage from the E. coli inner membrane where the MCP homodimers reside. MCPpeptide variants synthesized with interfacial point mutations involving non-b-branched aliphatic substitutions at position 31 stabilized the dimeric state of MCPpeptides, ®ndings which support the notion that MCP from Ff phage was designed to behave in the host inner membrane via nuanced residue-dependent dimer modulation within a window of stability dictated by evolutionary pressure. The overall results illustrate the general utility of MCP TM peptides as tools for elucidating the rules that govern transmembrane helix-helix interactions.

The degree of helicity was calculated using the relation given by Chen et al.17 Peptide samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4-12 % or 12 % NuPage precast gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Samples were boiled for ®ve minutes prior to loading. Band intensity was quanti®ed by band densitometry. For PFO-PAGE, 12 % NuPage precast gels were used as described57 by replacing SDS in the running buffer with 0.5 % (w/v) sodium per¯uorooctanoate (Oakwood Products Inc., SC) and 4 % in the sample buffer. Fluorescence spectroscopy Labeling of MCPpeptides with dansyl (N-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-l-sulfonyl)-L-lysine) (donor) and dabcyl (4-dimethylaminophenylazobenzoyl)-L-lysine) (acceptor), was achieved during synthesis using an extended coupling cycle (60 minutes) of labeled Fmoc-protected lysine residues (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Steady-state ¯uorescence spectra were recorded on a Photon Technology International C-60 ¯uorescence spectrometer. To ensure that peptides equilibrated in mixing assays, peptides were mixed in water prior to the addition of SDS detergent and Tris buffer. Similar results were seen when peptides were added to detergent micelles and allowed to equilibrate for two to four hours. Samples were examined in a stoppered 2 mm Â 10 mm quartz cuvette (Hellma, Concord, ON). Emission spectra were collected from 400 nm to 650 nm (lex  341 nm, 0.1 to 1 second/nm, bandpass  4 nm for excitation and emission) for dansyl-dabcyl FRET experiments. Pyrene iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) labeling of WT MCPpeptide containing a Cys residue between the N-terminal Lys-tag and the TM segment was achieved by dissolving crude peptide in 20 mM Tris-HCl to 100 mM ®nal concentration. Reducing agent TCEP (Tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine) was added to 1 mM ®nal concentration and incubated for ®ve minutes. Pyrene iodoacetamide suspended in dimethylformamide was added to a ®nal concentration of 250 mM and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4  C in the dark with shaking. Fluorescence emission spectra were collected from 350 to 600 nm (lex  341 nm, 0.1 to 1 second/nm, bandpass  4 nm for excitation and emission).

Peptide synthesis Peptides corresponding to MCP residues 21 through 48 (with three added N-terminal lysine residues) were synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry on a PerSeptive Biosystems PioneerTM peptide synthesizer. Synthesis employed the Pioneer's standard (45 minutes) cycle. Addition of Fmoc-protected labels was done during synthesis using an extended cycle (60 minutes). The HATU/ DIEA activator pair was used with a fourfold excess amino acid. A low-load (0.18-0.22 mmol/g) PAL-PEG-PS resin was used to produce an amidated C terminus. Peptides were cleaved with a cocktail of 88 % (w/v) tri¯uoroacetic acid, 5 % (w/v) phenol, 5 % (v/v) ultrapure water, 2 % (w/v) triisopropylsilane. Cleaved peptides were precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether. Centrifuged pellets were dried in a dessicator, redissolved in ultrapure water, and lyophilized. Crude peptide powder was dissolved in water and 10 mg of peptide was loaded onto a C4 preparative RP-HPLC column. The major peak from a water/MeCN gradient was collected and lyophilized. Mass spectrometry was used to con®rm the molecular mass of the puri®ed peptide and the Micro BCA assay was used to determine peptide concentration. Analytical HPLC chromatography was employed to con®rm the purity of peptides as >95 % pure. Secondary structure determination and SDS-PAGE and PFO-PAGE assays CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-720 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter. Samples were dissolved in buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 20 mM NaCl with 20 mM SDS. Spectra were obtained at peptide concentrations between 20 and 50 mM. Measurements were made using a quartz cuvette with a 0.1 mm path-length. Spectral scans were performed from 250-190 nm with a step-resolution of 0.2 nm, a speed of 20 nm/minute and
