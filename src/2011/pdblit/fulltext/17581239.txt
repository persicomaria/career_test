A novel series of pyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxamides was discovered as factor Xa inhibitors using structure-based drug design. This series consisted of a neutral 4-chlorophenylurea P1, a biphenylsulfonamide P4 and a D-proline scaffold (1, IC50 ¼ 18 nM). Optimization of the initial hit resulted in an orally bioavailable, subnanomolar inhibitor of factor Xa (13, IC50 ¼ 0.38 nM), which was shown to be efficacious in a canine electrolytic model of thrombosis with minimal bleeding.

rently being evaluated in late stage clinical trials and have shown potential as a safe, effective treatment to reduce the formation of blood clots. The intense research effort for orally bioavailable FXa inhibitors has been summarized in a number of publications (2). These analyses of the FXa literature categorized FXa inhibitors into two classes based upon the binding in the S1 pocket. One class of early inhibitors mimicked the natural interaction of prothrombin in the FXa active site that establishes a strong salt bridge between an arginine of prothrombin and Asp189 of the S1 specificity pocket of FXa. Such compounds often contained the highly charged phenylamidine group which mimics this interaction (6). The second class of compounds utilized neutral aryl groups bind into the S1 pocket, which other than Asp189, is hydrophobic in nature (7). A common binding motif with these was an aryl chloride making an head to face interaction with Tyr228 (3). Herein, compounds containing a neutral aryl chloride in the S1 pocket were targeted due to potentially enhanced permeability relative to P1 pharmacophores containing basic moieties (8). In addition to the S1 specificity pocket, a second major binding pocket of FXa is the S4 pocket formed by the arrangement of the aromatic amino acid residues Trp215, Phe174, and Tyr99 (6). Common to many inhibitors was a basic moiety that provided a significant p-cation binding interaction with these aromatic residues. Amidines, pyridines, and tertiary amines have all been described binding in the S4 pocket (2,6). In contrast, several groups have reported neutral aryl groups that bind within this pocket (2,9). Of particular interest at the time of design were the biarylsulfonamides and biarylsulfones that were described as viable P4-binding moieties (10,11). With this knowledge of known FXa inhibitors, structure-based drug design (SBDD) was used to evaluate an inhibitor that combined a biphenylsulfonamide P4 group and an aryl chloride P1 side chain (Figure 1). It was hypothesized that the combination of these two groups would create an uncharged compound of appropriate lipophilicity and hence acceptable pharmacokinetic properties. As a starting point of the design, the o-fluoroaniline P4 fragment was targeted based upon favorable results that were previously reported for this substitution (11). A rigid proline scaffold was selected to connect the P1 and P4 moieties in order to provide an orthogonal orientation evident in previous FXa/inhibitor inhibitors (11­13). Fivemember heterocyclic rings, such as a pyrrolidine ring, with a 1,2substitution pattern are a common scaffold in many FXa inhibitors (2).

Warfarin is a commonly prescribed oral medication for antithrombotic indications. Though it is an effective treatment for the reduction of reoccurring thromboembolic conditions, warfarin usage is complicated by liabilities that include non-specific inhibition, a slow onset and offset of action, a narrow therapeutic window, drug/drug interactions, and drug/food interactions (1). A new oral anticoagulant therapy devoid of these liabilities would be beneficial both to patients and to healthcare professionals. Due to the unique position of factor Xa (FXa) at the convergence of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, direct inhibition of FXa has long been an attractive anticoagulant target (2). Indeed, orally active FXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban (3) apixaban (4), and LY-517717 (5) are cur444

Structure-based Drug Design of Pyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxamides

Figure 1: Scope of proposed FXa inhibitors and optimal combination 1 as predicted by structure-based drug design. In addition, the secondary amine of the pyrrolidine ring provided a convenient point of extension to rapidly explore various linkers to probe the S1 pocket. The scope of the proposed inhibitors is illustrated in Figure 1 encompassed a large number of synthetic targets. Each potential target was a unique combination of the stereochemistry of the proline scaffold, a linker connecting the scaffold to the aryl chloride, an aryl ring, and the position of the chlorine substituent on the aryl ring. Using a previously determined crystal structure (13) and the docking program FlexXÒ,a the potential targets were docked into the FXa active site. Examination of these virtual compounds revealed that one combination had a superior spatial fit in the active site of FXa. The optimal combination 1 contained a D-proline scaffold with a 4-chlorophenylurea P1 moiety (Figure 1). The model of 1 placed the aryl chloride deep into the S1 pocket without steric interference with the enzyme wall (Figure 2). The chloride was observed to be oriented toward Tyr228 as desired. Additionally, potential hydrogen bonds were inferred that could form between the urea linker and the residues that line the S1 pocket. The D-proline ring extended toward a hydrophobic region lined by the disulfide bridge formed by Cys191 and Cys220. As expected, the biphenylsulfonamide was docked into the aryl-binding site.

ized by allowing the intermediate deprotected pyrrolidine (Scheme 1, step g) to react with 4-nitrophenyl 5-chloropyridin-2-ylcarbamate in DMF with triethylamine. Likewise, the deprotected pyrrolidine was allowed to react with 4-fluorophenylisocyanate to afford the 4-fluorophenyl derivative 36. Additional derivatives of 13 were synthesized according to Scheme 2. The trans-4-hydroxy analog 15 was obtained from 13 using a Mitsunobu reaction with p-nitrobenzoic acid, followed by hydrolysis of the ester with sodium hydroxide. Both the cis- and the trans-hydroxy compounds 13 and 15 were reacted with bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride (15) in methylene chloride to obtain the mono-fluoro analogs 16 and 17, respectively, with inversion of stereochemistry. The 4-hydroxyl group of 13 and 15 was selectively alkylated with TMS-diazomethane in a mixture of 48% aq. HBF4 in methylene chloride (16) to provide 18 and 19. Finally, compound 13 was oxidized to ketone 20 under the Swern conditions, followed by the conversion to the di-fluoro analog 21 using an excess of bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride (15).

Materials and Methods
Compound 1 and derivatives at the 4-position of the proline ring were synthesized starting with commercially available Boc-D-proline and cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline (Scheme 1). After the appropriate protecting groups were in place, the proline was converted to the acid chloride using oxalyl chloride. Reaction of the acid chloride with 4-bromo-2-fluoroaniline followed by a Suzuki coupling (9) provided the biaryl P4 group. In the case of the 4-substituted intermediate 9, oxidation of the methylsulfide to the methylsulfone was performed with mCPBA in ethyl acetate (14). Deprotection of the t-butyl carbamate and TBDMS groups was afforded by 25% (v/v) TFA in methylene chloride which was followed by reaction of the secondary amine with 4-chlorophenylisocyanate to provide the 4-chlorophenylurea P1 side chain. In the case of 1 and 14, the primary sulfonamide was revealed by stirring in TFA. In addition, compounds 34 and 35, containing a 5-chloropyridyl P1 side chain, were synthesa

Results and Discussion
The prototype compound 1 was determined to be a potent inhibitor of FXa with an IC50 ¼ 18 nM that provided the foundation for the continued investigation of this novel series of inhibitors (17). The corresponding S-enantiomer, synthesized in similar manner as 1, had greatly reduced potency (IC50: >1 lM), as predicted by the original modeling study. The modeling also correctly identified the 445

urea linker as the preferred moiety for extending the aryl group into the S1 pocket compared to the various linkers investigated.b Further exploration of the structural activity relationship (SAR) of this novel series involved maintaining the phenylurea and examining the substitution around the P1 phenyl ring (22­33, Table 1). A focused array of targets were prepared via parallel chemistry utilizing racemic 7 (Scheme 1) and a variety of isocyanates to verify the SAR of the S1 pocket. The results of this study are represented by compounds 22­33 in Table 1 and are in agreement with previously reported SAR (18). The racemic 4-chloro compound 23 was twofold less active than the corresponding chiral 1 as expected. The 3-chloro analog 28 had significantly diminished potency compared to 23 as the docking study predicted. The 4-methyl moiety 24, though similar in size to the 4-chloro substituent, resulted in a 10-fold decrease in potency. The larger 4-bromo 22 showed similar potency to 23; however, the bromine substitution was less desirable due to the large increase in molecular weight. Substitution at the 2-position, such as the fluorine analog 33, dramatically reduced potency. The results verified molecular modeling predictions that a 4-chlorophenyl substituent would be the preferred P1 pharmacophore.

Further, efforts were focused on improving the potency of 1 via derivatization of the pyrrolidine ring. From the analysis of the docking of 1 in the FXa active site (Figure 2), it was hypothesized that substitution at the 4-position of the proline ring may provide additional favorable interactions in the hydrophobic region of FXa lined by the disulfide bridge. In this manner, an increase in potency was obtained with several different substituents in the 4-position of the pyrrolidine ring (Table 2). The cis-4-hydroxy analog 13 increased the potency by approximately 45-fold compared to 1, suggesting that the hydroxyl group may be providing additional interactions with the enzyme. Capping the hydroxyl group as the methyl ether 18 gave another twofold increase in activity, suggesting that a hydrogen bond acceptor, rather than a donor, is important. Further, the corresponding trans-hydroxyl 15 and trans-methoxy 19 did not achieve the same potency as 13 and 18, respectively, suggesting the cisconfiguration is optimal for binding. The mono-fluoro derivatives 16, 17 and di-fluoro derivative 21 demonstrated increased potency relative to the unsubstituted pyrrolidine ring, albeit not to the same extent as the cis-hydroxy or cis-methoxy analogs. Even the intermediate ketone 20 increased the binding relative to the unsubstituted 1. The SAR of the 4-position can be explained by the results of the X-ray co-crystal structure. An X-ray co-crystal structure (1.5  Chem Biol Drug Des 2007; 69: 444­450

Rather, the oxygen of the methoxy group forms a strong hydrogen bond with the backbone N­H bond of Gly219. This interaction explained why replacing the 4-hydroxyl of 13 with a methyl ether maintained similar potency. Indeed, an X-ray structure of 13 was obtained and overlaid well with 18. The hydrogen bond to Gly219 was not predicted in the modeling studies. A hydrogen bond is unlikely the cause of the 15-fold increase in potency with the cis-4fluoro analog 17 given that alkyl halides have weak capability as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The increase in potency obtained with 17 was likely a result of lipophilic interactions rather than a hydrogen bond with Gly219. Comparisons of the X-ray structure of 18 to the docking of 1, modeled in a previous X-ray structure, indicated an excellent correlation, albeit with a slight shift in overall position (Figure 3B).

Other minor modifications were investigated in the P1 and P4 side chains, as seen in Table 2, which altered the lipophilicity, topological polar surface area (TPSA), solubility, and permeability.d Sulfonamides and sulfones on the P4 moiety were previously disclosed as being comparable pharmacophores (10,11) and indeed showed similar binding potential in this series as seen by 13 and 14. Though the primary sulfonamide generally showed an increase in solubility, the methylsulfone was preferred due to consistently higher plasma concentrations after oral gavage in the rat PK/PD assay (Table 3). Substituting the sulfone for the sulfonamide lowered the TPSA by approximately 25 2, resulting in values more consistent with permeable compounds (19). In general, the methyl sulfones demonstrated moderate permeability with the exception of 13 which failed to show permeability in the CaCO-2 model. The chlorine of 13 was replaced with a fluorine, resulting in compound 36 which had a reduced LogP and increased solubility and permeability. However, this substitution resulted in a 20-fold reduction in potency. Also, replacing the 4-chlorophenyl group of 13 and 18 with the 5-chloropyridyl group of 34 and 35 showed some propensity to increase the solubility and permeability, but resulted in an approximate 10-fold reduction in potency. These small modifications provided a range of analogs with varying potency, lipophilicity, and permeability which were observed to have major impact in vivo, as shown by the rat PK/PD assay (Table 3). Compounds in Table 2 were tested in a conscious rat pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (rat PK/PD) model (20) to give a qualitative measure of their anti-FXa activity (%Xa inh.), apparent half-life (t1/2 app.), and plasma exposure (area under the curve ¼ AUC ). Test compounds were dosed orally by gavage, and plasma samples were taken at set time-points up to 4 h postdose. FXa inhibition and 447

The prototype inhibitor 1 was not only potent in vitro, but also showed moderate FXa inhibition in the rat PK/PD model. An increase in the FXa inhibition was achieved with the 13 compared to 1. Inversion of the cis-4-hydroxy 13 to the trans-4-hydroxy 15 resulted in no activity in vivo. Replacing the 4-hydroxy with the 4-fluoro derivatives 16 and 17 resulted in compounds with higher exposure and half-life values, but with moderate FXa inhibition. These mono-fluoro derivatives had improved permeability versus the hydroxy derivatives 13 and 15. The di-fluoro derivative 21 showed similar PK/PD characteristics to the mono-fluoro compounds, despite having poor solubility. Both the mono- and di-fluoro derivatives had increased half-life compared to the hydroxy and methoxy analogs, possibly due to the removal of a site of metabolism. Incorporation of the 5-chloropyridyl P1 group gave mixed results. Comparing the cis-4-hydroxy analogs 13 and 34, it was observed that the 5-chloropyridyl had similar inhibition and an increase in exposure; however, it had a shorter t1/2. In the case of the cis-4-methoxy analogs 18 and 35, the 5-chloropyridyl had lower inhibition and exposure. In general, this replacement improved both the solubility and permeability with a reduction in half-life. Finally, replacing the P1 4-chlorophenyl with the 4-fluorophenyl resulted in a large decrease in half-life and FXa inhibition after 4 h. The anticoagulant activity of compounds showing acceptable activity and absorption in the rat PK/PD model was evaluated via prolongation of fibrin clot formation in human plasma as measured by the doubling of prothrombin time (2 · PT, Table 3). The inhibitors tested had moderate 2 · PT ranging from 1.60 to 2.46 lM. Compound 13 demonstrated a balance between activity, apparent t1/2, and AUC in the rat PK/PD model. The oral bioavailability and half-life of 13 in rat determined by cassette dosing was 17% and 2.0 h (Cl ¼ 12.4 mL/min/kg and Vdss ¼ 1.6 L/kg). The concentration of 13 required for 2 · PT was 1.86 lM in human and 2.0 lM in dog. In addition, 13 displayed binding selectivity of >1000-fold over a panel of related serine proteases as measured by Ki (thrombin, FIXa, FXIa, activated protein C, and trypsin). The efficacy of 13, being a representative analog of the new series, was tested in the canine electrolytic injury model of thrombosis (21) by administering intravenously to anesthetized dogs at three different doses. Administration of 13 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in time to occlusion (TTO) and a decrease in thrombus mass (TM) compared to control animals as illustrated in Figure 4. Blood loss in the control group averaged 5  1 mg compared to 4  3, 41  10 and 15  9 in the low-, mid-, and high-dose groups, respectively. A plasma concentration of approximately 1.3 lg/mL was associated with efficacy (50% reduction in TM) in both artery and vein. Compound 13 was measured to have an oral bioavailability of 25% and a half-life of 2.0 h (Cl ¼ 8.3 mL/min/kg; Vss ¼ 1.29 L/kg) in dog and efficacious concentrations, as defined by the electrolytic injury study, were achieved following oral administration. These results illustrate that 13 is an effective antithrombotic agent in the canine electrolytic injury model of venous and arterial thrombosis.

ling, a D-proline scaffold was utilized to combine an aryl chloride P1 and biphenylsulfonamide P4 pharmacophore, resulting in a potent inhibitor of FXa. Subsequent experiments confirmed that the modeling experiments predicted the most potent combination of four different variables. Further optimization at the 4-position of the pyrrolidine ring increased the in vitro binding potency. The representative compound 13 was demonstrated to be a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of FXa which was efficacious in the dog electrolytic injury model of thrombosis. The focus for this project going forward was to increase the oral bioavailability and half-life of this series of FXa inhibitors. Discoveries relating to that effort will be the subject of ensuing communications.
