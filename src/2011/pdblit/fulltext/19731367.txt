INTRODUCTION Methylmalonyl-CoA is an important metabolic intermediate that exists in several key degradative and biosynthetic pathways.1 The pathway responsible for the degradation of branched amino acids and odd chain fatty acids involves three steps. In the first step, a biotindependent carboxylation produces the S-epimer of methylmalonyl-CoA. The third step, the B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts the R-epimer of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA.1 This key epimerization between the two steps is carried out by the essential enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MMCE: EC number 5.1.99.1), which catalyzes the conversion of (2S)methylmalonyl-CoA to (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA. In prokaryotes, MMCE participated in autotrophic CO2 fixation via the 3-hydroxypropionate pathway, in propionate fermentation, the regeneration of glyoxylate and in the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics.2­6 In animals, defects of this pathway can result in a buildup of methylmalonic acid, which causes severe acidosis and also damages the central nervous system.7,8 In this study, we determined the crystal structure of TTE0360 from Ther° moanaerobacter tengcongensis to 2.0 A resolution using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) by short cryo-soaking with a high concentration of potassium iodide.9,10 In GenBank database, the gene tte0360 is predicted to be glyoxalase I, a member of glyoxalase superfamily. However, the TTE0360 structure is very different than the released structures of glyoxalase I. A search for the 3D homologs using DALI11 shows that TTE0360 has

significant structural similarity with the MMCE from Propionibacterium shermanii,12 which is also a member of glyoxalase superfamily. The fold type of the TTE0360 molecule belongs to the vicinal-oxygen-chelate superfamily (VOC).13 The similarities of structure folds, dimer formation, and active sites between TTE0360 and MMCE, suggest that the protein TTE0360 may be the MMCE from T. tengcongensis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning, expression, and purification

The tte0360 gene (NCBI Accession No. AE008691) was amplified by PCR from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis genomic DNA.14 The PCR product was subcloned into pHAT-2 vector by NcoI and Hind III restriction sites. This plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells and the cells were grown in LB media supplemented with 100 mg/mL ampicillin to a log phase (OD600 5 0.6). The expression of MMCE was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG at 378C, for 8 h. Cells were harvested and

The crystals of recombinant MMCE were grown at 208C using the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method. Drops consisted of 2 lL of protein solution and 2 lL of mother liquor (0.1 M citric acid, pH 2.6, 1.6 M (NH4)2SO4). Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained after 7­8 days growth. Native and derivative Crystals were soaked in 2 M Li2SO4 for 2 min before data collection and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The native data were collected on Beamline 1W2B at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility using a Mar555 flatpanel detector. The derivative data were collected on a Rigaku FR-E X-ray generator and the Rigaku R-AXIS IV11 image plate detector. Data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000.15 The statistics of data collection are summarized in Table I. The Matthews coefficient ° (V/M) of 2.0 A3 Da21 for both crystals suggests the presence of a monomer in an asymmetric unit with an estimated solvent content of 39% (v/v).16
Structure determination and refinement

The heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking the native crystals in the mother liquid supplemented with 0.5 M KI for 2 min. Three iodine heavy atom sites with occupancy beyond 20% (54, 47, and 32% respectively) in each asymmetric unit were determined using PHENIX.17 By using the initial phase from PHENIX, automatic model building was performed with ARP/ ° wARP18 at 2.0 A resolution. Model refinement was per19 and the program COOT20 was used formed in CNS, for inspection and manual improvement of the model. ° Within the resolution range 8­2.0 A, the native structure was refined to a final Rwork 5 21.8% and Rfree 5 24.7%, and confirmed to have good stereochemistry from the Ramachandran plot calculated by PROCHECK.21 The statistics of the refinement and the stereochemistry of the final model are summarized in Table I. The coordinates and structure factors of TTE0360 were deposited into RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession code 3GM5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The crystal structure of TTE0360 was determined to ° 2.0 A resolution using the SAD method (Table I). The

TTE0360 molecule exhibits a compact a/b structure with ° dimensions of about 51 3 35 3 36 A [Fig. 1(A)]. The asymmetric unit includes a monomer with 159 amino acid residues. The final model includes 151 amino acid residues (150 amino acid residues coded by the tte0360 gene and a serine from the His-tag), 1 citric acid molecule (CIT), 2 sulfate ions, and 129 water molecules. The fold type of TTE0360 monomer belongs to the VOC superfamily. One TTE0360 molecular is made up of two repeat modules, and each of these modules is a babbb motif. All the b strands of each module are arranged in the 1-4-3-2 order (such as b1-b4-b3-b2; b5-b8-b7-b6 in Figure 1(A,B), and the two insert a helixes are a1 and a4. The b sheets of the two modules pack edge-to-edge, and the first strand of the N-terminal module (b1) was determined to be antiparallel to the first strand of the Cterminal module (b5) [Fig. 1(B)]. These eight strands

were found to create a cleft to form the core of the TTE0360 protein monomer. There are other three a helixes, besides the two babbb motif: a2 is between b2 and b3; a5 is between b7 and b8; a3 is between b4 and b5 and links the two modules [Fig. 1(B)]. A long loop (Thr42-Arg60) between b2 and b5 in which a short helix (a2) is located was observed, and it was found to compose a region sticking out. This region and b6 of the C-

terminal module were shown to seal the cleft from the side. A helix (a3) was found to be located in the bottom of the cleft, closing the cleft from the back. In addition, a citric acid molecular was found to be bound in the cleft of TTE0360 and was confirmed by omit map. This citric acid makes a number of well-defined hydrogen bonds with the nearby residues and a water molecular to form a stable network.

Based on primary sequence analysis in NCBI, the TTE0360 protein was predicted to be a member of the Glyoxalase superfamily, glyoxalase I (Glo I). Several structures of glyoxalase I have been solved, and the functions of these proteins have been proved by functional experiments, including human glyoxalase I,22 mouse glyoxalase I,23E. coli glyoxalase I,24 and L. major glyoxalase I.25 However, using the released crystal structures of glyoxalase I as molecule replacement models, we could not solve the protein structure of TTE0360. We solved the structure using the SAD method. We found that the structure of TTE0360 and the earlier released structures of glyoxalase I are quite distinct. The three-dimensional structural comparison Z score of TTE0360 and human

Glo I, mouse Glo I, E. coli Glo I, L. major Glo I were 3.7, 3.6, 4.6, and 4.7 respectively. As shown in Figure 1(C,D), the structures of TTE0360 and glyoxalase I are very different. On the other hand, analysis by the program DALI showed significant similarities between TTE0360 and methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MMCE) from Propionibacterium shermanii (PDB id: 1j4c), giving a Z score of 12.7. The root mean square deviation between TTE0360 and MMCE from P. shermanii ° (psMMCE) was found to be 2.2 A for 145 Ca atom pairs. As shown in Figure 1(E), the crystal structures of TTE0360 and psMMCE are similar in the protein core region with differences in some loops. A remarkable difference was found at the loop (Thr42-Arg60) in

TTE0360, which was much longer than the corresponding loop (Asn41-Gly45) in psMMCE. In psMMCE, two short loops (Asn41-Gly45 and Asp116-Gly124) were shown to seal the side of the active pocket. Because the two loops are remote from each other, they can only close the active pocket roughly. However, in TTE0360 the loop (Thr42-Arg60) and the b6 strand (Gly121-Phe126) are much closer, and Ala48 and Asn53 on the loop form hydrogen bonds with Asp125 and Ile121 on the b6 strand respectively. In TTE0360, the loop (Thr42-Arg60) and the b6 strand (Gly121-Phe126) close the active pocket compactly.
Dimer structure

The dimerizations of TTE0360 and psMMCE are very similar. The psMMCE is a dimer in both solution and crystal.12 The data of size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation show that TTE0360 is also a dimer in solution. Although there is only one molecule in an asymmetric unit of TTE0360 crystal, the two molecules related by the two-fold axis of the spacegroup P41212 can form a tight crystallographic dimer. Superimposition of the dimers of TTE0360 and psMMCE shows significant similarities between the two structures, as shown in Figure 1(F). The two TTE0360 monomers pack back to back, stacking with the b strands as well as psMMCE. Their active sites open outward in opposite directions, and thus each monomer active site is completely independent. TTE0360 at the interaction surface, there are many hydrophobic residues just as those in psMMCE, including Val12, Ile14, Ile16, Val18, Phe31, Phe32, Pro70, Leu71, Leu73, Ile96, Ile99, Phe101, Leu113, Leu140, Val142, and Ile144. Dimeriza° tion buries 1204 A2 of the surface, which represents 14% ° of the surface of each monomer (8800 A2). The resemblance of dimerization between TTE0360 and MMCE also suggests that TTE0360 may be the MMCE from T. tengcongensis.
Active site

MMCE is a metal-dependent enzyme. In the active site of psMMCE, a metal binding site (His12, Gln65, His91, and Glu141) binds the coenzyme Co21.12 Superimposition of the structures of TTE0360 and MMCE shows that the four residues Gln13, Glu74, His98, and Glu145 of TTE0360 correspond to the metal binding site. According to the common catalytic mechanism of VOC superfamily members, the two axial active site residues are both glutamic acids, and they are also involved in the catalytic reaction.13 Although no bound metal ion is present in TTE0360 structure, a typical MMCE metal binding site is formed by these four residues. The distance between the OE1 of Glu74 and the OE1 of Glu145, which could be regarded as the axial residues of the

° active site, was determined to be 5.1 A. There is enough space to hold a bound metal ion among the side chains of these residues. We modeled a metal ion into the active site of TTE0360. The distances between the metal ion and the four residues Gln13, Glu74, His98, and Glu145 ° are 2.8, 2.5, 2.2, and 2.7 A, respectively, indicating that this metal ion is quite suitable in the active site of TTE0360 [Fig. 2(A)]. In addition, a citric acid molecule was found to be bound in the active site of TTE0360. It is not the substrate of MMCE, but it can bind to the side chains of Gln13, Glu74, Tyr 133, and Glu145 and a water molecular, and makes a number of well-defined hydrogen bonds to form a stable network [Fig. 2(B)]. Mccarthy and coworkers modeled 2-methylmalonate above the binding site of Co21 in psMMCE, and found two oxygens on C1 and C3 of the substrate could form chelate bonds with the metal ion.12 In TTE0360 structure, two oxygens on C1 and C6 of the citric acid can also form chelate bonds with the modeled metal ion, ° ° with the distances 2.2 A and 2.8 A, respectively [Fig. 2(A)]. We can predict that the citric acid can compete for the binding site at the substrate binding site with 2methylmalonate, and it may be a universal substrate of these proteins. Citric acid plays a similar or opposite role when taking the place of 2-methylmalonate remains to be proved. To summarize, we determined the crystal structure of ° TTE0360 from T. tengcongensis to 2.0 A resolution. Based on primary sequence analysis in NCBI, the TTE0360 protein was predicted to be glyoxalase I. But the superimposition of the two structures shows that they are very different. We found significant similarities between TTE0360 and a MMCE from Propionibacterium shermanii using the program DALI. By superimposition and careful analysis, TTE0360 and psMMCE were found to have very similar monomer structure and almost the same dimerization. Also, the metal binding sites in the cleft of the two structures are conserved. A metal ion was modeled into the metal binding site of TTE0360, and it can form a six-coordination with the four conserved residues and two oxygens of the citric acid. The others, a citric acid molecule binds to the substrate binding site. It may be the competitive analog of 2-methylmalonate. Comparing with the results from primary sequence analysis, the three-dimensional structural informations suggest that TTE0360 may be the MMCE from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis.
