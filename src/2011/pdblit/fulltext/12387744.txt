Abstract The development of the B cell lineage has been extensively studied along with the soluble and cellular components involved in the maturation and selection process. It was not always clear, however, what factors were involved in supporting mature B cell survival. Identification of the B cell survival factor, BAFF, was a key discovery in understanding the survival mechanism for mature B cells in the periphery. More recent investigations have illuminated roles for BAFF in B cell biology outside of a survival mechanism. These include germinal center maintenance, isotype switching, and regulation of specific B cell surface markers. More importantly, a role for BAFF in B cell biology has been validated in vivo in humans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction B cells are a critical component of the adaptive immune system, hence the factors and mechanisms required to form the mature B cell pool have been extensively studied. B lymphopoiesis is a complex process with commitment to the B cell lineage taking place in the bone marrow (BM), and selection occurring both in the BM and peripheral lymphoid tissues. Stromal elements, soluble factors and surface IgM have all been recognized as playing distinct roles in the genesis and maturation of mature B lymphocytes. A key advance in the understanding of B cell genesis and development has been the discovery of B cell activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF), a fundamental B cell survival factor. BAFF is not required at all stages of B cell development, however, and its signal can be transduced via several receptors. In addition, BAFF plays a role in B cell biology outside of a survival function, which include immunoglobulin isotype switching, germinal center maintenance and regulation of specific B cell surface molecules. 2. BAFF and BAFF receptors BAFF (also called BLyS [1]) is a type II membrane protein that can exist either in a membrane form or secreted as a trimeric

or multimeric molecule [2,3]. Initially believed to be produced solely by cells of the myeloid lineage, BAFF has now been shown to be expressed by cells of non-hematopoeitic origin. BAFF-producing cell types include monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, T cells, follicular dendritic cells, splenic radiation-resistant stromal cells, astrocytes, fibroblastlike synoviocytes, nurse-like cells, osteoclasts and ductal epithelial cells [1,4­18]. Interestingly, several of these same cell types also produce a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), another TNF family ligand that is closely related to BAFF (reviewed in [19]). IFN , IFN , IL-10, G-CSF and CD40L have been shown to stimulate BAFF production in certain cell types [5,7,8], and malignant B cells have been found to express BAFF, although the mechanism for BAFF induction in such cells is unclear [20,21]. BAFF binds to three receptors within the TNF receptor family, BAFFR/BR3 [22,23], BCMA [24] and TACI [25], the latter two also bind APRIL. BR3 is the dominant BAFF receptor expressed on all mature murine and human B cells. TACI is expressed at a high level on murine splenic marginal zone (MZ) and transitional type 2 (T2) B cells and at a low level on some splenic mature cells, while human TACI is expressed on a subset of tonsillar memory B cells and mature blood B cells [26­28]. Although BCMA has been found abundantly in an intracellular compartment in some human B cell lines, surface expression has not been readily observed. BCMA has only been found to be expressed at a low level on a proportion of human germinal center (GC) B cells [10], more abundantly on multiple myeloma cells [29,30], and has not been described on the surface of any

mouse B cells, the latter primarily due to a lack of appropriate reagents. 3. Elucidating BAFF function BAFF was first described as a B cell activating factor because it was found to stimulate human B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin (Ig) production in vitro when the B cell receptor (BCR) was crossed linked with anti-IgM [4]. Subsequent studies showed that unlike CD40 stimulation, BAFF alone does not induce mouse or human B cell proliferation, but rather prolongs B cell survival by preventing apoptosis [26,31]. Its fundamental role in B cell survival became apparent upon the generation of mice transgenic (Tg) for the baff gene. The B cell pool beyond the transitional type 1 (T1) stage of development in BAFF Tg mice is significantly expanded, with the largest increase seen for T2 and MZ B cells [32­35]. The survival function of BAFF was further validated by the generation of BAFF knockout (KO) mice. These mice exhibit severe B cell hypoplasia, decreased circulating Ig and impaired humoral immune responses [36,37]. Additional in vitro experiments using human B cells provided further insight into which B cell subsets were most susceptible to BAFF signaling effects. In cultures of human splenic B cells BAFF exerted a greater survival effect on CD27+ memory B cells when compared to CD27- na¨ve B cells [26]. When human memory B i cells were stimulated to differentiate into CD38+ immunoglobulin secreting cells (ISC), BAFF was found to further promote the survival of these cells, which resemble plasmablasts [26]. While BAFF binds to three receptors, several lines of evidence point to BR3 as the receptor through which BAFF exerts its survival function. First, A/WySnJ mice, a strain with a naturally occurring mutation within the br3 gene resulting in reduced expression and function, and BR3 KO mice exhibit a phenotype similar to that of BAFF KO mice, namely severe loss of peripheral B cells and diminished circulating Ig [38,39]. Second, neither TACI nor BCMA KO mice have impaired B cell survival, and in fact TACI was determined to be a negative regulator in the murine system since TACI KO mice have an expanded B cell pool and develop autoimmunity [40­42], third, mice generated that lack both BCMA and TACI possess a normal B cell compartment [38], and fourth, surface protein expression analyses in mouse and human systems have shown that BR3 is found on all mature B cells, unlike BCMA or TACI (discussed above). 4. B cell development and survival 4.1. Bone marrow B cell precursors In the adult animal, B cell development begins in the BM where the microenvironment, consisting of stromal elements and soluble factors, is perfectly suited to foster B cell development from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. An ordered sequence of events results in the expression of specific surface markers followed by the formation of the earliest B cell progenitors, which further develop into immature B cells. Rearrangement of the Ig heavy and light chain gene segments and expression of the pre-B cell receptor complex, followed by surface IgM, are criti-

cal steps in the process since signaling through these molecules drive B cell differentiation and selection (reviewed in [43]). It was evident from analysis of B cell precursors and immature B cells in the BM of BAFF KO mice that BAFF is not required for immature B cell genesis in this compartment. There also was no impact seen on B cell precursors in BR3 KO mice [38]. Pro-B, pre-B and immature B cells exist in normal numbers in both KO strains, in contrast to the dramatically reduced numbers of mature B cells in the BM. 4.2. Murine peripheral B cell survival and maturation Immature B cells leave the BM via the bloodstream and enter the spleen where they undergo further maturation. Immature B cells, also called T1 cells, are distinguishable from other splenic B cell subsets by their surface phenotype. It is clear from the phenotypes of the BAFF, BR3, BCMA and TACI KO mouse strains that BAFF and BR3 are required for B cell survival and maturation beyond the T1 stage of development. Data indicate that BAFF-induced survival is achieved through an NF- B-mediated increase in anti-apoptotic molecules, including members of the Bcl-2 family, [44,45] down regulating the proapoptotic protein Bim [46], and blocking nuclear translocation of protein kinase C [47]. Interestingly, the requirement for BAFF is not absolute for all B cells. In both BAFF KO and BR3 KO mice, while there is a profound loss of peripheral B cells, low numbers of blood B cells and tissue B2 B cell subsets persist, and B1 B cells are seen in normal numbers. By using IgM and IgD expression patterns to delineate T1, T2, mature and MZ B cell subsets in the spleen, we showed that while all subsets (except T1) experienced a profound loss in BAFF KO and BR3 KO mice, small numbers of cells did in fact remain. Indeed, upon histological examination the existence of some MZ B cells were confirmed by geographic localization [27]. In addition to the observations made in genetically altered mice, the requirement for BAFF in normal B cell development and maturation has been further validated by the treatment of normal adult mice with the BAFF inhibitors, BCMA-Fc and BR3-Fc. Mice treated with either BCMA-Fc or BR3-Fc exhibited a significant reduction in the number of peripheral blood B cells, lymph node B cells as well as splenic B cells [48­50]. Early data suggested that BAFF functions not only as a survival factor, but also as a differentiation factor. CD21 and CD23 are markers routinely used in combination to delineate the various B cell subsets in the spleen as they mature. T1 cells lack both CD21 and CD23, however, CD21 expression is observed as the immature B cell differentiates and is present at different levels on T2, follicular and MZ B cells. CD23 is up regulated on T2 and follicular B cells, but is absent on MZ B cells. Further phenotypic characterization of the subpopulations in BAFF KO mice using expression of CD21 and CD23 revealed that these surface markers are significantly reduced compared to wildtype (WT) B cells, suggesting that BAFF-mediated signals regulate expression of CD21 and CD23. Addition of recombinant BAFF or media alone to BAFF KO or wildtype splenic B cells confirmed that BAFF could stimulate expression of these proteins [27]. Although CD21 was similarly reduced in BR3 KO and

292

A/WySnJ mice, CD23 was expressed at WT levels in A/WySnJ mice and at an intermediate level on B cells from BR3 KO mice [38]. This suggests that in mice CD23 expression is regulated by BAFF, but not via BR3. Further analysis of BCMA KO and TACI KO mice would address the role of these receptors in CD23 regulation. Interestingly, human peripheral blood B cells have not been found to up regulate CD21 in response to BAFFmediated signaling, rather CD19 and CD20 were found to be slightly up regulated on B cells when exposed to BAFF in vitro [9]. These disparate findings may reflect a difference between the mouse and human BAFF systems, differences in B cells from independent anatomical locations, differences in the quality of the BAFF-mediated signal due to avidity disparities (the mouse data was generated using soluble BAFF and the human data was generated using membrane bound BAFF), or the fact that the human B cell cultures received an additional activation signal. It should be noted that species differences in the BAFF system have been observed including the fact that mouse BCMA has a very low affinity for mouse BAFF, while human BAFF-BCMA affinity is quite high [51], and although murine TACI appears to serve a negative regulatory role, humans with defective TACI signaling exhibit immunodeficiencies [52]. 4.3. BR3 expression Given that the BAFF/BR3 axis is responsible for delivering the B cell survival signal, it is of interest to understand the expression pattern and regulation of BR3 on B cells in general as well as on specific B cell subsets. Since precursor and immature B cells are not impacted in KO animals, it was not surprising to discover that pro- and pre-B cells lack surface expression of BR3 and that only a small proportion of immature BM B cells express a low level of BR3 [27]. These data correlated with results from BAFF binding studies using purified BM B lineage subsets [53], and revealed that BR3 expression occurs concomitantly with IgM expression at the immature B cell stage. In the mouse spleen, as in the BM, only a small proportion of T1 cells express a low level of surface BR3. In contrast, T2, mature and MZ B cells all express high levels of BR3, with T2 having the highest level, followed by mature then MZ B cells [54]. In cynomolgus monkeys, CD21high splenic B cells (equivalent to MZ B cells in humans) have an approximately 2-fold increase in BR3 levels when compared to CD21med B cells [55]. In human tonsil, na¨ve B cells have the highest BR3 expression i followed by memory B cells, with GC B cells having quite low BR3 expression [10]. BR3 is expressed at a high level on all human peripheral blood B cells [28]. What controls the level of BR3 in the different subpopulations is not fully understood. One investigation demonstrated that BCR ligation of mature splenic B cells results in increased BAFF binding and upregulation of BR3 mRNA, exclusively [31]. A recent report shows that mature splenic B cells from c-Myb-deficient mice have 50% reduction in BR3 mRNA and 31% reduction in surface staining intensity using polyclonal Ab against BR3 [56]. Subsequently, mature B cells from c-Myb-deficient mice were found to have a somewhat reduced response to BAFF in vitro as measured in a survival assay. Further studies are necessary to fully understand

the regulation of BR3 expression, as well as the other BAFF receptors. 4.4. BAFF and B cell survival in primates While most studies on BAFF function have been done in the murine system, recent data show that primate B cells also require BAFF for survival. Weekly BR3-Fc treatment of cynomolgus monkeys for 18 weeks resulted in a reduction of peripheral blood B cells, with CD20+ cells 45­60% of baseline at the end of the dosing period. Significant decreases in CD20+ follicular and MZ B cells in lymph nodes and spleen were also observed. Na¨ve i B cells appeared to be equally susceptible to BAFF blockade with BR3-Fc in cynomolgus blood and lymphoid tissues, and a significant loss of CD27+ memory B cells was observed in lymphoid tissues [55]. No reductions were seen in NK, T cell or plasma cell populations. Similar results of BAFF blockade were seen in a non-human primate study using a humanized anti-BAFF/BLyS mAb (belimumab) [57]. Importantly, clinical trials of belimumab confirmed the role of BAFF in human B cell survival in a phase I clinical trial. In a trial conducted in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), individuals received 1 or 2 infusions of the anti-BAFF/BLyS mAb. A significant reduction, 12­47%, in peripheral blood B cells was observed beginning on day 42 of the study compared with placebo, and no dose response was observed [58]. It should be noted that B cell loss upon administration of a BAFF inhibitor is much more rapid in rodents than what has subsequently been observed in non-human primates and man, which may relate to differences in the kinetics of B cell death between the species. 5. BAFF and humoral immunity 5.1. Basal Ig levels BAFF Tg mice not only have a dramatically enlarged peripheral B cell compartment, but they also exhibit highly increased circulating Ig of all isotypes and IgG subclasses [32­34]. IgA was increased to the greatest extent when compared to control mice. Not surprisingly, BAFF KO mice exhibit a significant decline in circulating IgM, IgG and IgE. Unexpectedly, however, basal IgA levels were just modestly reduced in BAFF KO mice. BR3 KO mice, generated in two independent laboratories, were also found to exhibit reduced serum IgM and IgG levels, and in a side-by-side comparison of BAFF KO and BR3 KO mice, BAFF KO mice generally had the greater reduction in serum Ig. Normal levels of IgA were observed in BR3 KO mice. The near normal basal levels of serum IgA observed in both BAFF KO and BR3 KO mice complement data generated in vitro which show that BAFF/TACI and APRIL/TACI axes are responsible for IgA class switching [59]. Not surprisingly, reduced IgA levels were observed in TACI KO mice [40,41]. Furthermore, B-1 B cells, which are BAFF- and BR3-independent for survival, are a known source of mucosal IgA [60]. These cells express surface TACI, as well as BR3 [38], thus IgA production by these cells may be regulated by BAFF/TACI or APRIL/TACI interactions.

5.2. Germinal center formation and T-dependent antibody responses T cell-dependent humoral immune responses are preceded by cognate T cell­B cell interactions followed by activation of Ag-specific B cells, migration of the activated B cells to the follicles of secondary lymphoid organs and initiation of the germinal center (GC) reaction. Within the GC, B cells undergo rapid proliferation, mutation of Ig variable region genes, and finally selection of B cells with high affinity BCR leading to formation of Ab-producing and memory compartments. The GC microenvironment provides a substructure that is critical for continuous Ag exposure to B cells through immune and complement receptor-mediated Ag capture [61]. Given the paucity of mature B cells in BAFF KO mice and markedly reduced circulating Ig, it was expected that the ability of these mice to form GCs would be lost. Contrary to this notion, both BAFF KO and BR3 KO mice have the ability to form GCs upon Ag challenge [38,54,62], and in addition, BR3 KO mice form spontaneous GCs in mesenteric lymph nodes in response to gut-derived bacterial antigens [39]. Inhibition of BAFF using a receptor fusion protein, BCMAFc, in healthy adult mice also demonstrated that BAFF is not a requirement for GC formation [54]. However, through analyses of both BAFF KO and BR3 KO mice it was evident that BAFF and BR3 are required for the maintenance of the GC reaction during the course of a T-dependent immune response. The kinetics of the GC reaction were found to be altered in BR3 KO and BAFF KO mice when animals were challenged with either a small hapten or particulate Ag, and the course of the declining Ag-specific Ab response correlated with the rapid dissipation of GC structures. In both genetically altered mouse strains and mice treated with BCMA-Fc, Ag-challenged mice at day 6 of the immune response exhibited normal numbers and size of the GCs, however with time the total number of GCs declined more rapidly than control animals. An increase in small GCs and decline in large GCs was seen, indicating overall dissipation of the GC structure. The reason for a lack of GC stability in BAFF- and BR3deficient environments was investigated by examining both the GC substructure and characteristics of GC B cells (Table 1). It was found that BAFF KO and A/WySnJ mice have a normal primary follicular dendritic cell (FDC) reticulum as determined by the presence of CD35+ FDCs. As the GC structure forms, FDCs mature and acquire additional surface markers that are involved in immune complex (IC) trapping and Ag presentation.

ingly, BAFF KO mice fail to develop a mature FDC reticulum based on staining for FDC-M1 and Fc RIIB. Normal mice that receive the BAFF inhibitor BCMA-Fc also fail to successfully develop a mature FDC, in contrast to A/WySnJ mice that form a normal, mature reticulum [54,62]. Not surprisingly, IC deposition was found to occur on the FDCs in GCs of A/WySnJ mice, but not BAFF KO mice [62]. Lack of Ag stimulation, therefore, might be the primary or a contributing factor for attenuation of the GC response in BAFF KO mice. Additional characteristics of the GC reaction were examined and no defect was found in the ability of T cells to migrate to the GC or for the GC B cellspecific transcription factor Bcl-6 to be expressed in BAFF KO and A/WySnJ mice. Increased B cell apoptosis and/or impaired proliferation are also potential defects that could contribute to GC instability. While normal apoptotic events were observed in the GCs of A/WySnJ mice, as well as GC B cell proliferation in the early stage of the GC response, these animals exhibited decreased B cell proliferation beginning at the intermediate stage of the GC response. In contrast, GC B cells had no proliferation defect in BAFF KO mice [62]. Taken together it appears that mice with a BR3 deficiency have a B cell autonomous defect that contributes to early GC attenuation, while BAFF deficiency appears to result in perturbed FDC development. An important function of the GC reaction is to provide a microenvironment that promotes somatic hypermutation, affinity maturation and selection of B cells with a high affinity BCR. Despite the defects discussed above and the attenuated nature of GCs in mice with BAFF and BR3 deficiencies, it was discovered that somatic hypermutation was not impacted by either BAFF- or BR3-deficient environments when compared to control immunized animals [54,62]. This latter finding is in line with the observation that high affinity Ag-specific Ab can be detected in mice treated with a BAFF inhibitor, albeit at a drastically reduced level [54]. When directly comparing T-dependent immune responses in BAFF KO and BR3 KO mice, differences were revealed [38,39]. In examination of responses to KLH, BR3 KO mice showed little or no decline in the IgM response when compared to wildtype controls whereas BAFF KO mice had a dramatic decline when compared to controls. Both strains showed a reduced IgM response to sheep red blood cells, although the response was lower in BAFF KO mice, and the decline in IgM response to chicken gammaglobulin was similar between BAFF KO and BR3 KO mice. Both KO strains demonstrated similarly reduced IgG Ag-specific responses. Based on the overall data, it is likely

that the reduced Ab response to TD Ags in a BAFF or BR3deficient environment is due to a limited number of mature B cells available to respond and an attenuated GC response. Autoantibody production is largely T cell-dependent, thus, the impact of BAFF blockade on plasma cell development is of particular interest. In mice the number of splenic Ab-forming cells was significantly reduced with BAFF inhibition, and significantly reduced in both spleen and BM after dual BAFF/APRIL inhibition [63]. In addition, it was found that in vitro-generated human plasmablasts down regulate BR3 and up regulate BCMA [26], allowing for the possibility that APRIL may play a role in plasmablast and/or plasma cell biology. Several BAFF inhibitors are being developed for, or are currently being tested in, clinical trials in autoimmune patients. In a phase I SLE clinical trial with belimumab, some reduction in the anti-dsDNA titer was observed [58], indicating that at least a portion of plasma cell/plasmablast survival or function can be blocked with BAFF inhibition. Furthermore, TACI-Fc (blocking both BAFF and APRIL) was shown to reduce IgM levels in healthy volunteers [64]. Additional clinical testing is required to have a more complete understanding of the role of BAFF in plasma cell biology. 5.3. BAFF and T-independent Ab responses A defect in mounting T-independent type II (TI-II) responses was first observed in BAFF KO mice [36]. Soon thereafter TACI KO mice were generated and shown to have a similar defect while maintaining the ability to mount normal TD responses, implicating a BAFF/TACI axis for at least some TI responses [40,41]. Interestingly, BR3 KO mice exhibit a normal TI-II response when immunized with the Pneumovax vaccine, yet have reduced responses when immunized with the TI-II antigens, TNF- or NP-ficoll [38] [39]. It appears, therefore, that all TI-II antigens thus far tested require BAFF, but that the BAFF receptor requirement varies. 6. Autoimmunity and B cell malignancies While the role of BAFF in disease is not the focus of this review, it is worth mentioning that BAFF does provide a survival mechanism for autoreactive B cells as well as B cell malignancies. BAFF overexpression has been linked to autoimmunity, initially through the finding that BAFF Tg mice develop both lupus nephritis-like and Sj¨ gren's syndrome-like diseases as o they age, but more importantly by the discovery that patients with various autoimmune diseases exhibit elevated levels of soluble BAFF in their sera and target tissues [65,66]. Additionally, BAFF has been described to provide an important survival mechanism for many B cell malignancies, some through an autocrine pathway [20,21,29,30,67­69]. The increasing number of different cell types found to express BAFF has allowed for a greater understanding of how BAFF-containing microenvironments might drive and/or support pathological B cell survival. Examples include BAFF-expressing fibroblast-like synoviocytes [14] and ductal epithelial cells [16­18] that may foster ectopic B cell-containing lymphoid clusters found in joints and

salivary glands of rheumatoid arthritis and Sj¨ gren's Syndrome o patients, respectively, thus contributing to disease manifestation. BAFF-expressing astrocytes [12] might support B cell survival in the CNS and contribute to formation of CNS lymphomas, and nurse-like cells, which have been described to produce both BAFF and APRIL, support CLL B cells in vitro [13]. It is this vast pool of experimental data linking BAFF to abnormal B cell survival and function that has fostered the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at the BAFF pathway and ultimately pathogenic B cells.
