Certain pathogenic trypanosomatids are highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production, and hence their glycolytic enzymes, including glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), are considered attractive drug targets. The ternary complex structure of Leishmania mexicana GPDH (LmGPDH) with dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and ° NADþ was determined to 1.9 A resolution as a further step towards understanding this enzyme's mode of action. When compared with the apo and binary complex structures, the ternary complex structure shows an 118 hinge-bending motion of the C-terminal domain with respect to the N-terminal domain. In addition, residues in the C-terminal domain involved in catalysis or substrates binding show significant movements and a previously invisible five-residue loop region becomes well ordered and participates in NADþ binding. Unexpectedly, DHAP and NADþ appear to form a covalent bond, producing an adduct in the active site of LmGPDH. Modeling a ternary complex glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and NADþ with LmGPDH identified ten active site residues that are highly conserved among all GPDHs. Two lysine residues, Lys125 and Lys210, that are presumed to be critical in catalysis, were mutated resulting in greatly reduced catalytic activity. Comparison with other structurally related enzymes found by the program DALI suggested Lys210 as a key catalytic residue, which is located on a structurally conserved a-helix. From the results of site-directed mutagenesis, molecular modeling and comparison with related dehydrogenases, a catalytic mechanism of LmGPDH and a possible evolutionary scenario of this group of dehydrogenases are proposed.

tively called leishmaniases, whereas two closely related species of Trypanosoma (T. brucei and T. cruzi, respectively) are the cause of sleeping sickness in Africa and Chagas' disease in Latin America. Chemotherapy is the main way to control the disease, but unfortunately the currently used drugs suffer from problems such as toxicity and parasites developing resistance.2 ­ 4 Our laboratories have been studying several trypanosomatid enzymes in order to assist in the development of new therapeutic compounds against these parasites.5 ­ 8 All members of the family Trypanosomatidae contain unique peroxisome-like organelles called

glycosomes where a major part of the glycolytic pathway is compartmentalized.9 ­ 14 The first seven glycolytic enzymes, as well as NADþ-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH, EC 1.1.1.8) and glycerol kinase, are sequestered inside the glycosomes.15 The glycolytic enzymes are attractive drug targets because these parasites depend heavily on glycolysis for their ATP production during the mammalian stage of their life cycle.16 GPDH catalyzes the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and L -glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) using NADþ as a cofactor:17 DHAP þ NADH Y G3P þ NADþ In the bloodstream form of T. brucei, GPDH is responsible for maintaining the NADþ/NADH balance in the glycosome by the oxidation of NADH produced by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) during glycolysis. The G3P produced is then transported across the glycosomal membrane via a G3P:DHAP shuttle that functions in conjunction with a mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase.10 Because of the absence of both lactate dehydrogenase and the classical mitochondrial respiratory chain, this is the only pathway for the re-oxidation of NADH and therefore GPDH is supposed to function almost exclusively in the direction of G3P formation. Inhibition of GPDH would reduce the glycolytic flux and thus the ATP production by the trypanosome. Moreover, it will most likely also lead to the accumulation of DHAP in the glycosome which may spontaneously convert to methylglyoxal, a toxic compound that reacts nonspecifically with proteins.18 ­ 20 A recent flux control analysis of T. brucei glycolysis has suggested that GPDH contributes to controlling the overall rate of glycolysis, and that inhibition of this enzyme is an efficient manner to decrease the flux.21 ­ 24 Several trypanocidal drugs, such as cymelarsen and suramin, inhibit trypanosomal GPDH, suggesting its potential as a drug target in trypanosomes.19,25 For Leishmania species, GPDH remains to be validated as a drug target, because their glycolytically produced NADH is thought to be re-oxidized mainly via glycosomal malate dehydrogenase26 and fumarate reductase.27 Moreover, the importance of glycolysis for ATP production in the mammalian-infective (amastigote) stage of this parasite remains to be established. This organism possesses an active mitochondrion throughout its life cycle.26 Nevertheless, GPDH in Leishmania may also play an important role in utilizing the glycerol liberated from neutral lipids especially in the amastigote stage where fatty acids rather than carbohydrates are used predominantly as an energy source.28 L. mexicana GPDH (LmGPDH) shares 63% overall sequence identity with the T. brucei enzyme and residues making direct hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic contacts with the substrates are completely conserved.28 Therefore, LmGPDH could serve as a

model for the design of drugs targeting T. brucei GPDH. Although the structures of LmGPDH in its apo and NADH bound forms were solved in our laboratory,29 the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme remained unclear because the binding mode of the substrate G3P was not known. Here, we report the crystal structure of LmGPDH complexed with the substrate DHAP and the product NADþ, which revealed the architecture of the active site and major conformational changes upon substrate binding. Based on the crystal structure and results from site-directed mutagenesis, the residues critical for enzyme catalysis are proposed.

homodimer and the two subunits are related by non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. Each monomer is composed of two domains linked by a short three-residue loop (residues 198 ­200). The N-terminal NAD-binding domain (residues 9­ 197) has the canonical Rossmann fold with a central six-stranded parallel b-sheet with helices on both sides.31 The first b-a-b unit contains the highly conserved GxGxxG NAD-binding motif32 that has been observed in all NAD-dependent GPDHs studied so far.33 The C-terminal substratebinding domain (residues 201­ 357) is primarily a-helical and contains residues that are important for substrate specificity. Upon binding DHAP and NADþ, LmGPDH undergoes large conformational changes (Figure 1(a)). When the Ca atoms are used for superposition, the A subunit of the ternary complex (E·NADþ ­DHAP) shows an RMSD value of ° 1.41 A with both the apo and NADH-bound structures. However, superposition of the N and C-terminal domains of the ternary and apo struc° tures separately shows RMSD values of 0.54 A ° , respectively, indicating that the two and 0.98 A individual domains are undergoing smaller conformational changes than the whole protein. In comparison, the apo and the binary (E·NADH) structures are very similar to each other with ° RMSD values of 0.41 A,29 indicating that the domain motion occurs when both the substrate DHAP and product NADþ are bound. When the N-terminal domains (residues 9 ­197) of the apo and ternary complex structures of LmGPDH are superimposed, it appears that the C-terminal domain (residues 201­ 357) of the ternary complex (E·NADþ ­DHAP) has moved considerably due to a hinge bending motion which brings the two domains closer to each other. The C-terminal

domain rotates 11.38 with respect to the N-terminal domain, with the Ca atom of residue 297 on the surface far from the hinge moving by as much as ° 6.0 A. Such domain motions upon substrate and cofactor binding have been observed in a number of dehydrogenases including glutamate dehydrogenase, liver alcohol dehydrogenase and GAPDH.34 ­ 37 The domain movement was analyzed by the program Dyndom38 using the ternary and apo LmGPDH structures (Figure 1(b)). The analysis found a rotation axis (arrow in Figure 1(b)) and showed that the red "moving" fragment, indicated by the point of the arrow, rotates with respect to the blue "fixed" fragment (shaft of the arrow) with the green segment as a hinge region. The fixed fragment includes the N-terminal domain and part of the C-terminal domain (Figure 1(b); blue). Most of the C-terminal domain belongs to the moving fragment while the hinge region includes segments from the C-terminal domain including residues 209­ 210, 227 ­ 229, 231 ­240, 268­ 269, 242 ­250 and 302 ­ 320 (Figure 1(b); green). The dimer interfaces of the apo29 and ternary ° ° LmGPDH structures bury 3124 A2 and 2743 A2 of surface area, respectively, when calculated by the program NACCESS.39 The change in overall buried dimer interface is mainly due to the N-terminal ° domain where the apo structure buries 1200 A2 ° and the ternary complex 724 A2. The buried surface ° areas by the C-terminal domain are 1924 A2 in the ° apo enzyme and 1988 A2 in the ternary complex. Side-chain movements and ordering of an active site loop In addition to the overall conformational

changes, the side-chains of several residues that interact with the NADþ and DHAP also undergo significant rearrangements upon ternary complex formation (Figure 2(a)). To analyze the movements of the side-chains in the N and C-terminal domains separately the Ca atoms of each domain in the apo and ternary complex were superimposed. This indicated that side-chains of C-terminal residues undergo major conformational changes (Figure 2(c)), whereas those of the N-terminal region moved only slightly (Figure 2(b)). Especially the Cz atom of Arg274 near the C terminus shifts by ° as much as 5.9 A and this residue plays an important role in recognizing the phosphate groups of DHAP and NADþ by swinging into a position where it makes five hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups from both molecules. In both the apo and NADH-bound structures, the loop formed by residues 294 ­296 was disordered and the electron density was invisible.29 This loop has become ordered and visible in the ternary complex and Thr294 is now part of an a-helix. This ordering of the loop region is presumably due to the formation of the H-bond between the backbone amino group of Val298 and the oxygen of the phosphate group of NADþ after domain closure (Figure 5(b)). The ordered loop completely surrounds the NADþ moiety and positions the substrate in the active site.

Binding mode of the adduct When the Fo 2 Fc difference map was examined before model building it showed clear density that can accommodate the cofactor NADþ and the DHAP molecule (Figure 3(a)). Upon closer inspection it was obvious that the density for NADþ and DHAP was connected, and when DHAP and NADþ were modeled into their corresponding densities the distance between the C-3 atom of DHAP and the C-4 atom of the nicotinamide of the ° cofactor was 1.5 A. The linked electron density and short interatomic distance suggest the presence of a covalent bond between DHAP and NADþ after the DHAP molecule reacted with NADþ in the active site of LmGPDH forming an adduct. Such an adduct formation was reported in Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase where ketone ­ NADþ adduct formations were observed.40 After fitting the adduct into the density, there was an extra density close to the O-3 atom of the DHAP moiety. This extra density may suggest that unreacted DHAP and NADþ molecules are present in the crystal. When the DHAP and NADþ molecules were modeled into the Fo 2 Fc difference density and refined, the distances between the C-4 atom of NADþ and C-3 atom and C-2 atom of ° ° DHAP are 2.9 A and 2.8 A, respectively (Figure 3(b)). It seems likely that mixtures of adduct and separate DHAP and NADþ molecules are present

Leishmania mexicana Glycerol-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase

339 with the phosphate group of NADþ that is close to the nicotinamide ring. One of the buried water molecules, Wat159, makes four H-bonds with the oxygen atoms of the adduct. The Nz atoms of two lysine residues, Lys125 and Lys210, form H-bonds with the O-2 atom of the DHAP moiety, the atom from which a proton is abstracted when the enzyme catalyses the oxidation reaction of G3P to DHAP. The O-3 atom of DHAP is H-bonded to the Nz atom of Lys125, and to the Og and backbone amide of Ser155. From the amino acids involved in H-bonding with the adduct, residues Lys125, Ala157, Lys210, Arg274 and Asn275 are completely conserved among the 23 known GPDH sequences (Figure 6). The NADH molecule in the binary LmGPDH structure (E·NADH) and the NADþ moiety of the DHAP ­NADþ adduct complex bind to the same region of the enzyme. In both structures the bound NADþ molecule adopts an extended conformation with the adenine ring in the anti and the nicotinamide ring in the syn conformation. Most of the H-bonds in the ternary complex structure remain the same as in the binary structure with a few changes. First, the H-bond between the 20 hydroxyl group of the nicotinamide ribose and carboxylate of Glu300 in the binary structure is replaced by an H-bond between the 20 -hydroxyl group and a water molecule. Second, the O-7 atom of the nicotinamide ring in the ternary complex forms an H-bond with the backbone amide group of Ala157. But the most dramatic change involves the oxygen atoms of the pyrophosphate group of the NADþ moiety, which make seven hydrogen bonds in the ternary complex structure (Figure 5(b)), whereas no hydrogen bond between the pyrophosphate group of NADH and protein is observed in the binary complex structure. Structurally related enzymes The program DALI41 was used to search for structurally related enzymes using the ternary complex structure of LmGPDH. As expected, many dehydrogenases with a dinucleotide-binding domain showed structural similarity. The top scorers are N-(1-D -carboxyethyl)-L -norvaline 2-ketopentoate dehydrogenase (CENDH),42 43 2-reductase (KPR), UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGDH),44 L -3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase

SigmaA weighted Fo 2 Fc map contoured at 2.4s level before model building shown with the final model of (a) the adduct and (b) DHAP and NADþ: even though the O-3 atom of DHAP is well positioned in the density, the distances between the C-4 atom of NADþ and C-3 atom and C-2 atom of DHAP are very short: ° ° 2.9 A and 2.8 A, respectively.

in the crystal producing electron density contributed by both the ternary complex and the enzyme ­ adduct complex. As a result of conformational changes and sidechain rearrangements, the DHAP moiety is almost completely buried and inaccessible by bulk solvent (Figure 4(b)). The NADþ moiety of the adduct is surrounded by the protein after domain closure ° ° burying 700 A2 out of 848 A2 total accessible surface area. For comparison, the NADH in the binary complex (E·NADH), where one side of NADH is ° solvent exposed, buries 600 A2 (Figure 4(a)). The DHAP moiety of the adduct makes numerous hydrogen bonds with the protein and water molecules (Figure 5). Each oxygen atom in the phosphate group of the DHAP moiety is hydrogen bonded to at least two donor atoms. Residues that act as H-bond donors include the Og atom of Ser273, the side-chain and backbone amide groups of Arg274 and the Nd2 atom of Asn275. Especially Arg274 plays an important role in recognizing phosphate groups by making three H-bonds with the phosphate group of DHAP and two H-bonds

All these enzymes are NAD(P)dependent dehydrogenases/reductases and of these only acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase requires a metal ion (Mg2þ) for catalysis. The N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain of each of these enzymes consists of the canonical six-stranded parallel b-sheet with helices on both sides and show high structural similarity among these enzymes. The C-terminal domains of these enzymes and the relative orientation of N and C-terminal domains are more varied. Only the top two scorers found by

DALI, i.e. CENDH and KPR, have the same topology as GPDH in both N and C-terminal domains (Figure 7). It is noteworthy to mention that glycerol dehydrogenase,48 a NADþ-dependent enzyme that also requires Zn2þ for catalysis, had a very low Z score of 3.4 even though the substrates of glycerol dehydrogenase and GPDH are very similar. The catalytic mechanism is well characterized for 6PGDH47,49 and MDH36,50 ­ 52 and both of the enzymes use a lysine residue as a general base for catalysis (Table 2). The structural similarity and the utilization of NAD(P) as a co-substrate of 6PGDH, MDH and GPDH lead to the suggestion that they may share a similar catalytic mechanism. The possible evolutionary relationship of these three enzymes will be discussed later.

Mutagenesis studies and proposed mechanism for catalysis and adduct formation In an attempt to obtain further information about the catalytic mechanism, we employed sitedirected mutagenesis followed by analysis of the enzymatic activity of the mutants to investigate the role of certain residues in the reaction catalyzed. Inspection of the active site revealed that

two lysine residues (Lys210 and Lys125) and one water molecule are within hydrogen bonding distance from the O-2 oxygen atom of the DHAP moiety of the adduct (Figure 8(a)). Based on this observation, four mutants were made: Lys125Met, Lys125Ala, Lys210Met and Lys210Ala. The mutated proteins were purified and their activity was assayed. Whereas the recombinant LmGPDH wild-type enzyme, purified in parallel, displayed

a specific activity and Km value for DHAP similar to the data reported previously (142 units/mg and 0.18 mM, respectively, this study, compared to 154 units/mg and 0.18 mM, before28), the four mutant enzymes showed virtually no activity. Even when 100 ­200 times more enzyme was added to the cuvette than used in the assay of the wild-type enzyme, no NADH consumption was

detected. This result suggested that both lysine residues play a critical role in catalysis. Although the ternary complex structure revealed the active conformation of the enzyme and the general architecture of the active site, the DHAP and NADþ are not an actual pair of substrate molecules and the adduct formed by them may not represent the true orientation of DHAP. In an attempt to

better understand the catalytic mechanism, DHAP was replaced by G3P, and an energy minimization using the program QXP53 was performed to obtain a model of the ternary complex of the enzyme with its active pair of substrates. One thousand cycles of energy minimization were carried out allowing NADþ, G3P, neighboring side-chains and water molecules to move. After minimization, the ° C-2 carbon atom of G3P had moved by 2.0 A and was positioned above the C-4 carbon atom of the nicotinamide ring. The C-2 carbon atom of G3P was facing the B side of the nicotinamide ring that is accessible for the transfer of the S hydride from G3P and the distance to the C-4 carbon atom of ° the nicotinamide ring was 3.5 A (Figure 8(b)). After energy minimization, three residues (Lys210, Asp263 and Thr267) are within H-bonding distance from the O-2 hydroxyl group of G3P (Figure 8(b)). Of these, Asp263 and Lys210 appear to be completely conserved among all GPDHs with known sequence,29 and Thr267 is completely conserved in all species except in Schizosaccharomyces pombe where the corresponding residue is a serine (Figure 6). Based on the role of lysine as a general base in

structurally related dehydrogenases including 6PGDH and MDH (Table 2), it is tempting to propose that Lys210 is the general base responsible for the deprotonation of the substrate G3P in GPDH. Lys210 makes H-bonds with two acceptor oxygen atoms including O-1 of G3P and the sidechain OH group of Thr267, the latter of which in its turn acts as a H-bond donor to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp263 (Figure 8(b)). These interactions direct the two hydrogen atoms of the unprotonated Lys210 to two acceptor oxygen atoms and make the lone pair of electrons available for proton abstraction from the O-2 atom of G3P. ° Lys125 is about 4 A away from the O-2 hydroxyl group of G3P in the energy-minimized structure and can stabilize the negative charge that may develop on the O-2 oxygen atom during catalysis (Figure 9(a)). The distance between the Nz of Lys125 and the O-2 oxygen atom of G3P may become shorter as the configuration of the C-2 of G3P changes from sp3 to sp2. The hydroxyl group of Thr267 may play an important role in orienting Lys210 and the substrate by making H-bonds with both the Nz of Lys210 and the O-2 hydroxyl of G3P. Asp263 seems to play a similar role by

making H-bonds with the O-2 hydroxyl group of G3P and the Nz atom of Lys125 (Figure 9(a)). However, the possibility of Asp263 or Lys125 being a catalytic residue cannot be excluded and further biochemical studies will be necessary to fully understand the exact role of each of these residues. The formation of the adduct by DHAP and NADþ observed in the ternary complex structure of LmGPDH reported here can be understood by the mechanism depicted in Figure 9(b). Aldehydes and ketones undergo keto-enol tautomerism54 and exist in solution as a mixture of two isomeric forms. When the enol form of DHAP binds to the active site of LmGPDH, a proton may be abstracted from the O-2 hydroxyl group followed by the electron pair transfer from the C-3 carbon atom of DHAP to the C-4 carbon atom of the nicotinamide ring forming a covalent bond between the two. Although the concentration of the enol form in solution is usually low because the equilibrium favors the keto form, the DHAP ­ NADþ adduct can accumulate in the active site of the enzyme because the formation of the latter is irreversible.

Discussion
The structure presented in this paper is the first crystal structure of GPDH in its active conformation with both substrate binding sites occupied. When compared to the apo form and binary complex (E·NADH) structure of GPDH determined earlier,29 the ternary complex (E·NADþ ­DHAP) shows a large conformational change via a hinge motion. Other structural changes include sidechain rearrangements and ordering of a previously disordered loop. The domain motion observed in the "closed" ternary complex structure seems to require stabilization by two molecules, DHAP and NADþ, simultaneously, since the apo form and binary complex (E·NADH) structures both show only the "open" structure. Structurally close neighbors of GPDH found by DALI are all NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases/ reductases (Table 2). Although the use of a lysine as general base was implicated in KPR43,55 and UDPGDH,44 we will focus our discussion on 6PGDH and MDH whose catalytic mechanisms have been well studied. The structural similarity of GPDH, 6PGDH and MDH and the conservation of a lysine as general base in 6PGDH and MDH support the idea that GPDH is also using a lysine residue as the catalytic base. Most NAD-dependent dehydrogenases are thought to have evolved by exon-shuffling by which an exon encoding the NAD-binding domain was fused to a different exon encoding the C-terminal domain providing a different substrate specificity. We looked for additional evidence to support the possibility that a common catalytic mechanism of these dehydrogenases is the result of a shared evolutionary

origin. To this end, we compared the topology and the location of the catalytic lysine residues of three enzymes including GPDH, 6PGDH and MDH (Figure 10(a)). The comparison showed that the catalytic residues of 6PGDH (Lys183) and MDH (Lys295) and the proposed catalytic residue of GPDH (Lys210) are all provided by the central a-helix, which is at the beginning of the C-terminal domain. This central a-helix, although it belongs to the C-terminal domain, is conserved amongst GPDH and all the GPDH-related enzymes except SCHAD (Table 2 and Figure 10(b)). Further analysis of the active site configuration by superimposing the nicotinamide ring of the three enzymes (because of the different relative orientation of the N and the C-terminal domains in these enzymes, superposing the N-terminal domains does not superpose the active site) showed that the active site is different in each case, both with respect to the composition and the location of the active site residues; only the use of a lysine residue as catalytic base is a common feature (Figure 10(c)). Therefore, this analysis suggests that each of these dehydrogenases developed its specific active site by divergent evolution from a common ancestral enzyme where the N-terminal domain contributed the NADþbinding site and the central a-helix the catalytic lysine residue; features that were conserved during evolution. Uncertainty still remains about the role of several specific residues in the active site of LmGPDH, due to the fact that the proposed catalytic mechanism is partly based on an energyminimized model and small movements of the side-chains in the active site may change the distances to the substrates and hence the role of each residue. Further studies including site-directed mutagenesis will be required to fully understand the role of each catalytic residue. The DHAP-binding site revealed by the ternary complex structure provides a possible target site for inhibitor design. Unfortunately, most of the substrate-contacting residues are highly conserved between the parasite and human enzyme, and the binding site environment is highly polar, which suggest that the DHAP-binding site is not an optimal choice for the development of inhibitors that should be selective for the parasite enzyme. The binding site for the adenosine moiety of NADþ provides more exploitable differences29 and stays relatively rigid during conformational changes, and thus seems to be better focal point for structure-based drug design.

column. The resulting protein was concentrated to 4 mg/ ml and dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mM triethanolamine (TEA) (pH 7.2), 4 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM Pefabloc. Soaking trials with 100 mM DHAP and 100 mM NADþ into apo crystals, grown as described,29 resulted in damage of the crystals and loss of diffraction. Eventually, crystallization conditions of the ternary LmGPDH complex (E·NADþ ­ DHAP) were found using commercial screening solutions followed by optimization. The best crystals were grown by co-crystallization at 20 8C by a sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 4 ml of reservoir solution consisting of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) and 4 ml of protein solution consisting of 4 mg/ml of protein, 20 mM TEA (pH 7.2), 4 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM Pefabloc, 100 mM DHAP and 100 mM NADþ. The crystals grew to full size in about two weeks. For data collection the crystals were transferred to a cryo solution composed of 30% PEG 8000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 100 mM DHAP, 100 mM NADþ and 15% (v/v) glycerol for about 30 seconds and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.

Data collection and structure determination ° The data set to 1.9 A was collected at the SBC-CAT beam line 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The crystal was cooled to 100 K using nitrogen stream during data collection. The data were integrated, scaled and merged with HKL2000 and SCALEPACK.56 Intensities were transformed to amplitudes using TRUNCATE.38 The space group of the crystal was P65 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the apo LmGPDH structure without bound water or substrate as a search model. The cross-rotation and translation functions were calculated using the program AMoRe.57 The top two solutions from the molecular replacement procedure were initially subjected to rigid body refinement using each subunit as a rigid body. The R-factor dropped significantly when each subunit was subsequently divided into the N-terminal (9­ 197) and C-terminal (201 ­ 357) domains for rigid body refinement. Visual inspection of the refined model at this stage clearly revealed the conformational changes between the two domains. The model was further

refined by Refmac58 using a restraint maximum likelihood method and SigmaA-weighted Fo 2 Fc maps showed well defined density for bound NADþ and DHAP for both subunits. The densities for DHAP and NADþ appeared to be connected, suggesting the presence of a covalent bond by the NAD ­ DHAP adduct formation. The stereochemistry of the models was verified using the software package PROCHECK59 and 93.9% of the residues were in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and the rest (6.1%) were in the additionally allowed region. The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Protein Data Bank accession code The coordinates have been deposited in the RCSB PDB with accession code 1N1E. Mutagenesis Four mutant versions of LmGPDH were prepared in which the candidate catalytic Lys residues 125 and 210 were substituted: Lys125Ala, Lys125Met, Lys210Ala and Lys210Met. To that end, the expression plasmid containing the wild-type enzyme (plasmid pET3A containing the LmGPDH gene29) was mutated by using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, USA) and custom-synthesized oligonucleotides (Invitrogen, USA). Codon changes made were, for both residues 125 and 210, AAG (Lys) into GCG (Met) and ATG (Met). Mutagenized plasmids were checked by sequencing the complete GPDH coding region for the introduction of the correct substitution and the absence of other, unwanted changes. Mutant and wild-type LmGPDHs were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, by growth of bacteria in 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 mg/ml) at 37 8C. At an A600 nm of 0.5­ 0.7 protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and additional ampicillin was added. Growth continued for five to seven hours, when cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at 220 8C. Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1 M TEA (pH 7.8), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaN3) and broken by two passages through a French pressure cell at 800 lb/in.2; incubated with 50 units of Benzonase (Merck, Germany) for 15 minutes at 37 8C; subsequently, 2 mg of protamine sulfate was mixed in with occasional shaking for 15 minutes on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000g for 15 minutes the precipitate was discarded. The supernatant was passed through Carboxi-Methyl Sepharose previously equilibrated in 0.1 M TEA (pH 7.8). After thorough washes, bound protein was eluted with a continuous gradient of 0 ­ 250 mM NaCl. The protein content of fractions was measured by UV absorption at 280 nm. The protein peak corresponding to wild-type LmGPDH was identified by standard activity assays29 and SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Identification of non-active mutant proteins was done by SDS-PAGE; the peak fraction of these proteins always appeared at the same salt concentration (157 mM, as determined by conductivity measurements) as the wild-type enzyme. Enzyme activity assays To determine the specific activity and for kinetic studies, the LmGPDH activity was measured by following the NADH oxidation at 340 nm in the presence of

DHAP. The assay was performed at 25 8C in 0.1 M TEA (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mM DHAP and 0.42 mM NADH. The dilithium salt of DHAP was dissolved at a concentration of approximately 7 mM in 0.1 M TEA (pH 7.1) and stored as 1 ml aliquots at 2 20 8C. The concentration of each DHAP aliquot was measured enzymatically before every assay. Precautions were taken to keep the NaCl concentration lower than 50 mM during the assays, especially in the case of mutants where large amounts of eluted fraction had to be added; when necessary a spin-concentrator (10 kDa cut-off) was used to concentrate the apo enzyme without increasing the NaCl concentration.
