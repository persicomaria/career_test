Structure of Actinidin, after Refinement at 1.7 A Resolution
E. N. BAKER Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry Massey University, Palmerston New Zealand (Received 18 February and Biophysics North

1980)

The structure of the sulphydryl protease, actinidin, after refinement at I.7 A resolution, is described. The positions of most of the 1666 atoms have been determined with an accuracy better than 0.1 A; only two residues (219 and 220) and the side-chain of a third (87) cannot be seen. In addition, the model contains 272 solvent molecules, all taken as water, except one which may be an ammonium ion. Atomic B values give a good indication of the mobility of different parts of the structure. Actinidin has a double domain structure, with one domain mostly helical in its secondary structure, and the other domain built around a twisted p-sheet. The geometry of hydrogen bonds in helices, ,6-structure and turns has been analysed. All are significantly non-linear, with the angle N-H...0 ~160". Carbonyl groups are tilted outwards from the axis of each helix, the tilting apparently unaffected by whether or not additional hydrogen bonds are made (e.g. to water or side-chain atoms). Each domain is folded round a substantial core of non-polar side-chains, but the interface between domains is mostly polar. Interactions across this interface involve a network of eight buried water molecules, the buried carboxyl and amino groups of Glu35, Glu50, LyslSl and Lysl7, other polar side-chains and a few hydrophobic groups. One other internal charged side-chain, that of Glu52, is adjacent to a buried solvent molecule, probably an ammonium ion.' Other side-chain environments are described. One proline residue has a cis configuration. The sulphydryl group is oxidized, probably to SO;, with one oxygen atom clearly visible but the other somewhat less certain. The active site geometry is otherwise compatible with the mechanism proposed by Drenth et al. (19751976) for papain. The positions of the 272 solvent molecules are described. The best-ordered water molecules are those that are internal (total of 17), in surface pockets, or in the intermolecular contact regions. These generally form three or four hydrogen bonds, two to proton acceptors and one or two to proton donors. Other water molecules make water bridges on the surface, sometimes covering the exposed edges of non-polar groups. Intermolecular contacts involve few protein atoms, but many water molecules.

1. Introduction
Actinidin is a proteolytic enzyme obtained from the fruit of the Chinese gooseberry or Kiwifruit, Actinidia chine&s. It has a free sulphydryl group, which is essential for activity (Arcus, 1959; McDowall, 1970), and has therefore been grouped with other sulphydryl proteases, such as the plant enzymes papain, ficin and bromelain,

the bacterial enzyme streptococcal proteinase, and the mammalian lysosomal enzymes, cathepsins Bl and B2 (Glazer & Smith, 1971; Lowe, 1976). The three-dimensional structure of actinidin was determined from an X-ray crystallographic analysis at 2.8 A resolution (Baker, 1977). This showed that the polypeptide chain conformation was virtually identical to that of papain (Drenth et al., 1971), at least within the accuracy of the analysis. The structure could not be reported in full detail, however, because complete amino acid sequence information was not then available. The amino acid sequence determination has now been completed (Carne & Moore, 1978), and has revealed that, allowing for a small number of insertions and deletions, about 48% of the residues are the same as the corresponding ones in papain (Mitchel et al., 1970). Furthermore, the X-ray analysis has been extended to I.7 A resolution, and crystallographic refinement (Baker & Dodson, 1980) has led to a very accurate description of the protein structure (accuracy of atomic positions <O*l 8) and identification of many water molecules associated with the protein. The purpose of the present paper is to describe details of the structure of particular interest, paying special attention to (1) the general organization of the molecule and the interactions that contribute to its stability and/or activity, (2) the hydrogenbonding geometry within elements of secondary structure (since only after refinement are hydrogen bond distances and angles reliable enough), and (3) the roles played by solvent molecules in their interactions with the protein and with each other. A detailed comparison of actinidin and papain will be made later, when refinement of the structure of papain, at present in progress, is complete.

2. Experimental
(a) Crystals

and data

collection

Actinidin was prepared as described by Came & Moore (1978), but crystals were not grown as for the 2.8 A analysis, where actinidin was crystallized as the tetrathionateinhibited enzyme, and the inhibitor then removed by washing crystals in dithioerythritol (Baker, 1976,1977). Instead, in order to ensure that no tetrathionate remained bound, the inhibitor was removed in solution, before crystallization, and the free enzyme crystallized. Crystallization conditions were otherwise identical to those used previously (Baker, 1973), and unit cell data were unchanged. For the 1.7 A analysis and refinement a new set of diffractometer data (24,157 independent reflections, including "unobserved" reflections) was collected, with most reflections twice. A total of 5 crystals were used. None of the data used for the being measured 2.8 A analysis was incorporated in this data set. (b) Refinement Most of the technical details of the refinement of the structure have been described used, and some of the results, must elsewhere (Baker t Dodson, 1980). Th e methods briefly be restated, however, as they are important to a proper evaluation of the structure. The refinement method used was that of fast Fourier least-squares refinement, developed by Agarwal (1978) and first applied by Isaacs & Agarwal(l978) in the refinement of insulin. Atomic positions (2, y and z co-ordinates) were refined independently, and after the first 7 cycles of refinement, when the crystallographic R value? had been reduced to 0.29, individual isotropic temperature factors (B values) were also refined. The protein

structure was regularized at intervals (i.e. constrained close to standard geometry) using the model-fitting routines of Dodson et al. (1976). Non-bonded contacts were not constrained in any way, however, and no energy calculations were incorporated. Solvent molecules (all regarded as water) were added at intervals, as they appeared in difference maps, but only following rather selective criteria, namely that they should have persisted through several difference maps, be remote from parts of the protein structure still in doubt, and be within approximate hydrogen-bonding distance of suitable protein atoms or other solvent molecules., The final R value for a regularized structure (root-mean-square deviations 0.01 A from standard bond lengths and 3.0" from standard bond angles) was 0.171 for all 23,990 reflections between 10 d and 1.7 A resolution (or 0.152 if reflections with I < 20~ were omitted). This model consisted of 1657 protein atoms (24 of partial occupancy) and 163 water molecules. More recently, hydrogen atoms have been added, in their calculated positions, and this has reduced R to 0.168 (0.149 with a 20 cut-off of data). Furthermore, a close examination of the final difference electron density map, and of the existing water structure, suggested that further water molecules should be added. While "water molecules" could be added almost indefinitely (and probably often erroneously) to account for low-level density, it' was clear that many of the low-level peaks (with heights 0.3 to 0.4 e/As) were in positions where they made the water structure more complete, hydrogen-bonding to, and often bridging between, existing water molecules and/or protein atoms. Thus a further 109 water molecules have now been added; they have been given B values of 50 A2, but have not been refined. The final model? consists of 1657 protein atoms (24 of partial occupancy) and 272 water molecules (163 refined, 109 unrefined). The R value is 0.165 (0.146 after reflections with 1 < 20~ are omitted).
(c) Accuracy

Standard deviations in atomic positions have been derived from the diagonal elements of the inverse least-squares matrix and the spread of values is shown in Table 1, as a function of the atomic B values. For most of the protein structure (~1350 atoms) B values are less than 15 AZ, and the overall estimated standard deviation is 0.055 A. This agrees well with a value of ~0.07 A, estimated from the size of shifts in least-squares value of ~0.10 A derived from the cycles near the end of refinement, and with a maximum variation of R as a function of resolution (Luzzatti, 1952). For the refined water molecules (WI to W163), with B values 7 to 40 AZ, positional standard deviations will be slightly higher, ~0.05 to 0.15 A. model has been constrained close to standard geometry, the Since the final protein standard deviations in bond lengths and angles given in Table 1 reflect mainly the tightness of constraints; they are derived from the spread of values after regularization. Watenpaugh et al. (1979), following their experience in refinement of rubredoxin, emphasize the need for caution in using idealized bond-angle parameters in model refinementj. The restraints used for actinidin, however, do allow for reasonable deviations from standard values. The r.m.s. deviation of 3.2" is of the same order as is found commonly in small molecule structures, and individual deviations of up to 10 to 12" occur. The only parts of the protein structure not regularized are the 3 disulphide bridges, which therefore offer an independent check on the validity of the refinement. Encouragingly, then, these are found to have very similar geometry to small organic disulphide molecules (Shefter, 1970). S-S bond lengths are 1.9'7, 2.01 and 1.96 A, C-SS angles range from lOl*O" to 108.3", and the dihedral angles (C-S-S-C) are 90*8", 84.5" and 96-O". Non-bonded contacts have not been constrained during refinement. The error in these is therefore derived from the standard deviations in atomic positions, and varies from t Co-ordinates and B values have been deposited National Laboratory, Upton, N.Y. 11973, U.S.A. with the Protein Data Rmk, Brookhaven

0.1 A (e.g. for hydrogen bonds or contacts'between internal atoms) to ~0.3 A (e.g. for distances involving the less well-defined water molecules). Similarly errors in hydrogen bond angles and torsional angles (C,$) range from 5' to a maximum of ~10". While the above standard deviations apply to most of the structure, there is also an associated with some residues. Some side-chains (e.g. those of Ser3, Tyr4, uncertainty Glu21, Asp97, Tyr130, Asp142, Lys145, Gln146, Glu172 and Glu191, all external, projecting into the surrounding liquid) have very weak density and correspondingly high `B values (see Fig. 1). They are clearly very flexible and the orientation seen is probably only the major one of a variety of possible orientations. Static disorder is seen for 5 sidechains (SerQ, Ser42, Ser44, Arg58 and Thr129) and probably exists in a less well-defined way for others (e.g. Met21 1). B values (see Fig. 1) probably give the best guide to the reliability of different parts of the structure. All unrefined water molecules (W164 to W272) should be treated with caution. For one side-chain (that of Glu87), no density is apparent beyond Co, and the two C-terminal residues, Asn219 and Asn220, are not included in the model at all. Some very weak density was seen beyond residue 218 in the final difference map but it was not considered reliable enough and these 2 residues must be regarded as disordered. (d) Positional change-s resulting from refinement

The average shift in main-chain atom positions (from those obtained from the 2.8 A map) was 0.50 A (median O-45 A). Although no peptide units had to be turned around completely (180'), 3 were twisted through more than 60" (those of 8 to 9, 95 to 96 and 151

Average values for main-chain atoms (N, C,, C, 0) and side-chain atoms (Co and beyond) are plotted for each residue. Residues totally exposed to the external solution are shown (O), those with only side-chain exposed (e), those with only main-chain atoms exposed (Q), and those totally buried (main-chain and side-chain) ( l )1(Note that the mean amplitude of vibration of an atom, g, is related to the B value by B = 8&J2, SOthat B = 20 A2 corresponds to a mean amplitude of vibration of 0.5 A.) to 152), while others were moved sufficiently to change the hydrogen-bonding pattern originally deduced. The average shift for side-chain atoms was 0.84 A (median 0.54 A) including the contributions of 19 side-chains which had to be manually rebuilt into quite new orientations (Glu21, Thr33, Ile37, Lys39, Thr59, Arg63, Asp66, Gln75, Ile78, Gln94, VallOO, IlellO, Glul14, Gln125, Asp138, Ilel66, Thrl71, Ile208 and MetPll). These gross changes arose from uncertainties or misinterpretations of the original 2.8 A map. In addition, a number of atoms were shifted quite large distances (> 1 A) during the automated least-squares cycles. (e) Amino acid sequence changes

The refinement has required one definite change to the amino acid sequence ; residue 86, identified chemically as Asp (Carne & Moore, 1978), proved to be clearly one carbon atom longer, fitting perfectly as Gln or Glu. It has been taken as Glu, to preserve the same charge as in the chemical sequencing. If this is so, one of the carboxyl oxygens, 08a is only 2.5 A from GE2 of Glu50, suggesting that they may perhaps share a proton, with one Glu having

a high pK value. (The pH of solution is 5.9.) This is found to occur in lysozyme where 2 adjacent Glu residues result in a pK value of 5.9 for Glu35 (Parsons $ Raftery, 1970). Three other residues could also represent sequence errors or variations (see Table 2). Ser42 appears to be disordered, with 2 alternative positions for 0,, but residual positive density in the positions of both 0, and 0; (despite low B values) suggests it could actually be Thr. (Note that in papain residue 42 is Thr.) Ala101 had density beyond Co in the 2.8 d map. During refinement this extra density weakened but it was later found that a water molecule (W92) had moved to be only 1.8 A from Cp. On removal of W92, the density persisted. Either residue 101 should be Ser, or there could be genetic variations at this point with some molecules containing Ala101 and some SerlOl (note that this is the most variable part of the sequence, compared with papain). Finally, Ile164 could possibly be Val. Throughout refinement, C,, and Cal tended to move together, B values are high side-chain, and C or makes several close contacts for an internal (3.1 to 3.2 A) with other side-chains. No alternative Ile conformation could be found, and a more satisfactory fit may be as Val.

Several authors (Frauenfelder et al., 1979; Artymiuk et al., 1979) have commented recently on the significance of atomic temperature factors (B values) in indicating the flexibility of parts of a protein molecule. The refinement method used for actinidin is suitable for refining B values, and although the latter have not yet been particularly extensively analysed it is clear that they hold considerable physical significance. To provide an objective assessment, Table 3 lists the B values of all Lys and Phe sidechains. For the latter, the individual B values are reasonably consistent within each group. The Lys side-chains show the effects of different environments. Lysl7 and Lysl81 are internal, constrained by hydrogen bonds and salt linkages, and their B values are low. Lys39 is confined in a surface pocket, and forms 3 or 4 H bonds (through N<t); its B values are also low. Lys 106 and Lys2 17 are more exposed (although in each case N< forms 3 H bonds) and B values are consistently higher, while Lys145 projects right out from the surface of the molecule and has high B values, increasing to -50 Aa at the end of the side-chain. t The IUPACIUB (1970) nomenclature conventions are generally used throughout this paper.
In Tables, and occasionally in the text, the Latin equivalents of the Greek subscripts are used for clarity (e.g. NZ for NC, CE for C,). Main-chain carbonyl groups are designated CO(123) etc., and main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms 123 0 or O(123). Main-chain amide nitrogens are identified NH(123) or 123 N.

The average B values for the main-chain and side-chain atoms of each residue are plotted in Fig. 1. Main-chain atoms involved in helices (e.g. 24 to 43, 69 to 81, 50 to 57 and 120 to 130) and strands of p-sheet have low B values, while more loosely held regions have higher values (see e.g. the external loops 92 to 100 and 139 to 160, and the exposed turn, 171 to 175, between strands C and D of t,he /?-sheet). Internal side-chains have much lower B values than external ones (except where the latter are involved in specific interactions such as H bonds or ion pairs). In many peptide units the carbonyl oxygen atom has a higher B value than the other atoms, indicating some torsional flexibility.

3. The Structure
(a) General organization The overall polypeptide chain conformation of actinidin is shown in Figure 2, where a-carbon positions are plotted. The molecule has a clearly defined double domain structure, with the active site lying between the two domains on the top surface. Domain I (residues 19 to 115 and 214 to 218) consists principally of residues from the first half of the chain and domain II (1 to 18 and 116 ta 213) residues from the second half. The N-terminal and C-terminal ends act as "straps" crossing over

from one domain to the other to help hold the two halves of the molecule together, Interactions involving these straps are detailed in Table 4. The N-terminal strap is wrapped around the surface of domain II, while the C-terminal strap is inserted between residues 113 to 116 and the rest of domain I (so that Pro215 projects into the non-polar core of domain I while hydrogen bonds are made with residues 111 to 114 on the outside).

Domains I and II could clearly fold up independently of each other. Residues 1 to 17 are probably laid over the surface of domain II after the latter has assumed its final folded structure ; several internal water molecules lie between 1 to 17 and the rest of domain II. Probably these bind to domain II during the folding process and are then tra,pped when the N-terminal section is laid over the top. Residues 214 to 218 must, however, become associated with domain I before it assumes its final folding, since they must tuck inside residues 113 to 116. Residues 113 to 116 are part of a piece of extended chain (105 to 120) and it seems likely that this remains somewhat "floppy" until the C-terminal end has associated with the rest of domain I. Bot,h domains have a congregation of non-polar side-chains in their interior (see later), but the interface between the two, lying below the active site, is largely polar, made up of mostly polar side-chains and a network of buried water molecules. (This is also discussed later.) There are three disulphide bridges (22 to 65, 56 to 98 and 156 to 206); all have normal geometry (see above, Experimental, section (c)).

Hydrogen bonds involving protein atoms are shown schematically in Figure 3 (for main-chain atoms) and listed in Table 5 (for side-chain atoms). In both cases hydrogen bonds are assumed if the donor-acceptor distance is less than 3.2 A and bond angles are reasonable. A few approaches of 3.2 to 3.4 A which may represent weak attractions are also noted. "Lost" hydrogen bonds (where main-chain amido or carbonyl groups neither interact with solvent nor form hydrogen bonds) have been noted before, e.g. in

elastase (Sawyer et al., 1978) and carp parvalbumin (Moews & Kretsinger, 1975), and in the latter case are considered to have some functional significance. There are very few of such lost hydrogen bonds in actinidin. In all, only 14 carbonyl and 17 amido groups do not form definite hydrogen bonds, and of these 10 carbonyl and 12 amido groups are accessible to solvent (and most do, in fact, have weak density adjacent). Of the four internal carbonyl groups which are not hydrogen bonded, three (those of residues 82, 131 and 157) are probably stabilized by other interactions with neighbouring polar groups (CO(131) is antiparallel with CO(127) and CO(128) ; CO(157) is antiparallel with COal( 138) ; and 0(82) is 2.96 A from Oal of Asp80). The fourth, CO(49) is directed towards a non-polar region; this is discussed below (section (d),(i)). Of the five internal amido groups not hydrogen bonded, four are directed towards potential hydrogen bond acceptors 3.5 to 4 A away. Thus very little hydrogen-bonding potential is not utilized. hydrogen-bonding side-chain atoms. Of 168 such The same is true for potentially atoms in actinidin, only 22 (13%) d o not form identified hydrogen bonds (see Table 5), and of these only one (Asn182 N 62) is not exposed to the external solution. A total of 93 (55%) hydrogen-bond to other protein atoms and the remaining 53 (32%) to water only. (c) Main-chain conformational angles

backbone are listed in Table 6, and The torsion angles 4, # along the polypeptide shown graphically in Figure 4, as the usual Ramachandran plot (with "allowed" regions outlined according to Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran (1965)). Apart from Gly residues, only seven residues have conformations with 4 in the range 50 to 100". Five of these (Ala93, Asnll9, Glu191, Asn199 and Cys206) are in the region for a left-handed a-helix, although none is part of a turn, or near-turn, of left-handed helix, and only one of these live (Cys206) is found in a "reverse turn" (Crawford et al., 1973). Both of the remaining two residues (Asp185 and Gln60) are in external loops where an unfavourable conformation seems unlikely to be "forced". Gln60, however, is one of two residues (60 and 61) that are insertions at this point in actinidin, relative to papain (Baker, 1977), and that are accommodated in a type II' reverse turn (Venkatachalam, 1968) involving residues 59 to 62. The unusual conformation for Gln60 may then result from the need to insert the two extra residues without disturbing the rest of the structure. Other conformational angles, 7 and W, have been restrained during the model refinement (by regularization). The looseness of constraints allows for some variation, however. The angles N-C&, for example, average -108" in pieces of extended chain (the strands of B-sheet, and the long extended section 92 to 120) but ~112" in helices and up to 117 to 119" in some turns. This is qualitatively the same as is seen in the latter are in rubredoxin (Watenpaugh et al., 1979) although the deviations larger. (d) Xecondary structure The secondary structure of the molecule is shown schematically Actinidin falls into the category of a + t?l proteins (Levitt & Chothia, in Figure 3. 1976), in that

a-helix and ,&sheet regions are segregated along the polypeptide chain. As in others of this type, one domain (domain I) is largely helical, while the other is built around a somewhat irregular twisted /?-sheet. (i) He&es Helices have been identified from the $,# values of the residues which comprise them, and from patterns of hydrogen bonding. Taking a helix to extend from the first hydrogen-bond donor in a helical region to the last hydrogen-bond acceptor, there are three major helices in actinidin (residues 24 to 43, 69 to 81 and 120 to 130) and four short ones (50 to 57, 85 to 89, 99 to 104 and 141 to 147). As can be seen from Table 6, the +,$ values within the helices (ignoring the first residue and the last one or two) approximate those of an ideal u-helix (-57, -47), although the mean values (Table 7) tend towards (-63, -40). Similar average values have been found in other refined protein structures, e.g. (-67, -41) in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975), and (-64, -40) in erythrocruorin (Steigemann & Weber, 1979). This is consistent with the observation (see below) that all carbonyl groups tend to tilt outwards, away from the helix axis. In every case except one, the first hydrogen bond of a helix is formed by a residue with non-helical ($,$) va 1ues. The exception is 50 to 57, where residue 49 might have been expected to form the first hydrogen bond, but instead has its carbonyl oxygen

directed away from NH(53) and NH(54) (3.7 A and 3.9 A distant, respectively) towards the non-polar core of domain I. The "loss" of this hydrogen bond is probably attributable to the hydrogen bonds made by NH(50) with the carboxyl group of Glu50 and an internal water molecule, W5. The hydrogen bonding tends to be irregular at the start of each u-helix (see Table 8, where hydrogen-bonding details are given). Helix 24 to 43 begins with a 4+ 1 hydrogen bond (the angles are more suitable for a 5 -+ 1 interaction, but the distance, 3.31 A, is too long), 69 to 81 begins with two 4+ 1 interactions (again the angles are more suitable for a 5-2 1 bond, but the distances, 3.37 A and 3.23 A, are too long), and both 50 to 57 and 120 to 130 begin with bifurcated (4+ 1 and 5+ 1) bonds. Each helix ends with one or two residues whose +,# values correspond more to those of an an helix (-93, -18). This phenomenon has been noted before (Nemethy et al., 1967) and has the result that the helix tends to end with one or two bifurcated or irregular hydrogen bonds. 2.7 to 3.3 A, with a mean The hydrogen bond lengths (0.. .N) vary considerably, value of 2.98 to 2.99 A (Table 8), rather longer than the value of 2.87 A for a standard a-helix (Arnott & Wonacott, 1966). Each of the principal a-helices has a polar side and a non-polar side. The central a-helix, 24 to 43, is completely buried, but its polar side-chains form part of the distinctly polar interface between domains I and II. Thus, although buried, one side of this helix is still associated with a number of water molecules and other polar groups. (ii) @%+ructure The twisted p-sheet around which domain II is built is shown in Figure 5. It consists basically of four strands, all antiparallel; strand B, which is a split strand, comprising residues 5 to 7 and 133 to 137; strand C, residues 162 to 172; strand D, residues 175 to 182; and strand E, residues 192 to 198. Two additional hydrogen bonds at each edge are provided by residues 213 (antiparallel with strand B) and 152 (parallel to strand E) and these could possibly be regarded as "strands" A and F. The sheet includes one classic p-bulge (Richardson et al., 1978), residues 167 to

As in the latter proteins, the standard deviations, obtained from the spread of values, indicate considerable variability. The distribution of 4 values appears to be bimodal, with about 40% of residues having 4 clustered around -95" (-80 to - 110) and the remainder centred on #J= - 140". The distribution of # values is unimodal. Thus many residues have 4,# values like those for a straight &strand (- 139, 135"), while others correspond to a more extremely twisted strand, with 4 - -95".

average hydrogen bond length is shorter than that seen in the a-helices (2.89&0*11 A compared with 2.98f0.10 A) and agrees well with normal N-H...0 hydrogen bond lengths. Several longer bonds are found at the ends of strands (but are included in Table 9 because their geometry is otherwise favourable). Only one hydrogen bond is bifurcated (137 0.. .161 N, 162 N at the end of strands B and C). The four central strands of the /?-sheet are largely buried in the interior of domain II. Not surprisingly there is a fairly non-polar distribution of amino acids in the p-sheet, namely Val,Ile,Gly,Tyr,Leu,Ala,Trp,Arg,Asp,Met,Thr,Ser,Asn,His,Glu,Lys,. Polar residues mostly occur at the ends of strands. Only three of the amido and carbonyl groups buried in these strands do not have hydrogen-bonding partners in adjacent strands; NH(136), CO(136) and CO(163) hydrogen bond to internal water molecules (see Fig. 3). The main-chain hydrogen bonding of the sheet is also relatively uninterrupted by additional hydrogen bonds from polar side-chains or water molecules. (163 0. ..Ser29 0,; 170 0.. Arg198 NV1 ; Only four such interactions occur 177 O...Arg198 N,; 181 O...W26). (iii) Turns Reverse turns, as described by Venkatachalam (1968) and by Crawford et al. (1973) are listed in Table 10. All those for which C1 .Cz is less than 6 A are given; all have a.. 4 -+ 1 hydrogen bonds. Turns expected to have only Gly at certain positions include types I' and III' (Gly at positions 2 and 3), type II' (Gly at 2) and type II (Gly at 3). The restrictions are followed by 172 to 175 (I'), 63 to 66 (II'), 201 to 294 (II') but not by 190 to 193 (I', Glu at position 2), 205 to 208 (III', Cys at position 2), 204 to 207 (II, Cys at position 3) and 59 to 62 (II', Gln at position 2). Even in these cases, however, the 4 + 1 hydrogen bond remains. Residues 201 to 210 form a very tight piece of structure on the surface of the molecule, including four Gly residues, and encompassing four turns as well as two other hydrogen bonds (see Fig. 6). No part of this structure could be described as helical, and residues 205 to 210 form a more or less planar S-shaped piece of structure, made up of two interlocking turns (205 to 208 and 207 to 210). It appears to be similar to a conformation previously noted in concanavalin A (Reeke et al., 1975). Several other chain reversals occur where the angles &,#s and &,,&, roughly correspond to reverse-turn configurations (e.g. 19 to 22 and 117 to 120), but where the distance C!:... C: is greater than 6 A, and no 4+ 1 hydrogen bond exists. In the case of 117 to 120 a tightly bound water molecule links residues 1 and 4, i.e. 117 O...W15...120 N. (iv) Linearity of hydrogen bouds in secondary structure

Hydrogen bond angles are listed in Tables 8 to 10. Since all the atoms involved are well-ordered, with B = 5 to 10 AZ, standard deviations are ~0.1 A in individual hydrogen bond lengths and ~5' in individual hydrogen bond angles. For an ideal linear hydrogen bond, the angle N-H...0 = 180", and for ideal interaction with a trigonal oxygen atom, C-&...H should be -120't. In helices a consistent pattern emerges. None of the hydrogen bonds are linear.
7 C-8...H refers (angle at H atom), to the angle etc. (in degrees) at the atom 0. Similarly for other angles, N-A...0

The average angle N-h.. . 0 is 16117" and in only one case, out of 29 regular 5 + 1 hydrogen bonds is it >170". The mean value of the angle C-d...N is 154*6", and that of C-a...H is 149&7". (Note that C-b...H is always less than C&...N.) These angles agree nicely with the average C-a.. .N angle of 156" found in the helices of the highly refined structure of erythrocruorin (Steigemann & Weber, 1979). They are consistent with a tilting of the carbonyl groups out from the helix axis (at an angle of ~12"). It is of interest that the tilting of the carbonyl groups is apparently unaffected by any additional hydrogen bonds with adjacent side-chains (e.g. Ser) or water molecules, i.e. all cerbonyl groups are tiLted this way. Where additional hydrogen bonds do occur (see Table 8), the angle C-O.. .D (D = donor, e.g. water molecule) is usually ~120", as expected. The hydrogen bonds in &sheets are also non-linear, with the angle N-k. .O averaging 163f7" and with only 7 out of 33 having this angle >170". Non-linearity

of hydrogen bonds within /3-sheets has been commented on before (Chothia, 1973), and while the reasons may be associated with the twisting of the sheet, it is interesting to note the similarity between the hydrogen bond angles in both helices and /3structure. The angles C-a...N (average 164&12") and C-a...H (average X2&12") are more variable in the @-sheet, however, and there is no clear pattern to their values. The hydrogen bonds in reverse turns, or 31,, bends, are sometimes referred to as ben,t ,because the angle C-6.. .N is ~120" (e.g. in rubredoxin, in eight 3,, bends, GC...N = 110 to 13:" (Watenpaugh et aE., 1979)). The same is true of the turns in actinidin, namely C-O. ..N = 105 to 146" (average 123+12"). However, the hydrogen bonds are ,no more non-linear than those in helices and /?-structure, as judge: by the angles N-H...0 (average 15659"). They may be more favourable, since C-O...H is ~120" and an oxygen atom lone pair then points directly towards the hydrogen atom. (e) Xide-chain environments (i) Non-polar side-chains Each domain has a core of buried non-polar side-chains (see Table 11). These are mostly Val, Leu or Ile, and although a number of aromatic groups contribute, they do not, with the possible exception of Phe74, intrude into the centre (see e.g. Fig. 7). Instead, as has been also noted in elastase (Sawyer et al., 1978), they tend to lie either on the periphery, just inside the surface of the molecule, or right on the surface. Residues in the latter category (Phe76, Tyr147, Phe152) often have one edge of their aromatic ring in contact with the core, and the other edge accessible to the external solution. None of the aromatic side-chains (6 Trp, 5 Phe, 14 Tyr) are packed plane-to-plane in a manner indicative of T-Z interactions. (The only likely interaction of this sort

is between His162 and Trpl84 in the active site, see below.) The only sizeable cluster of aromatic side-chains is that comprising Phe14.4, Tyr147, Phe162, Trp184 and TrplSS (see Fig. 7); these pack roughly in an "edge-on" manner (i.e. the edge of one ring approaching the plane of another) as is often seen in crystals of aromatic small molecules. Few of the non-polar side-chains in actinidin are fully exposed to the solvent. There are a small number of scattered non-polar groups on the surface (e.g. Va15, VallOO, LeulO2 and Va1216) and just one sizeable hydrophobic "patch", comprising Ile151, Val175, Leu197, Va1200 and CB C ,, of Thr153. This has no known function,

(ii) Proline

residues

Four out of seven Pro residues are external. One of them, Pro155 (Fig. 8) is a cis-proline (as it also is in papain), but although it comes immediately before Cys156, which forms one of the three disulphide bridges in actinidin, there is no obvious

structural requirement for a cis-proline in this position. On the contrary, it makes a small loop projecting from the surface and could perhaps have been an insertion earlier in the evolution of the sulphydryl proteases (since Gly154 could be joined to Cys156 with little disturbance to the structure). Of the other three external Pro residues, Pro90 comes between Tyr89 and Tyr91, both involved in structurally important hydrogen bonds, but the other two, Pro2 and Proll7, are in pieces of extended chain and do not appear particularly important to the structure. The three remaining Pro residues are Pro132 (in the domain-domain interface), Pro212 (in the surface of domain II) and Pro215 (in the non-polar core of domain I). (iii) Tyr and Trp side-chains Of the six Trp side-chains, three (26, 178, 188) case the indole nitrogen, NE1, is hydrogen bonded and once to a carboxyl group) (see Table 5). Two and both are hydrogen bonded (184 to water, 7 are completely buried, and in each (twice to carbonyl oxygen atoms, (7, 184) lie in the molecular surface to a carbonyl oxygen). The sixth,

in intermolecular interactions Trp122, projects from the surface, but is involved (hydrogen bonded to a neighbouring carbonyl group). Only one of the 14 Tyr side-chains (169) is completely buried; its -OH group makes two hydrogen bonds, helping to bind the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain to the rest of the molecule by linking residues 2 and 129. Three of the five partially buried Tyr residues have similarly important structural roles. The hydroxyl groups of Tyr89 and Tyr147 both form two hydrogen bonds, helping to stabilize loosely bound external loops. Tyr89 links residues 55 and 99 (see Fig. 9), while Tyr147 links

residues 150 and 195, helping to hold the external loop, 146 to 152, to the p-sheet of domain II. Tyr91 hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 19 at the domain-domain interface. The remaining two partially buried Tyr residues (177 and 193) have their -OH groups projecting into solution, where they hydrogen bond to water molecules. The remaining eight Tyr residues are all external, generally hydrogen bonded to water. (iv) Charged side-&ins Acidic and basic side-chains, which should normally be charged at pH 6, are mostly distributed over the surface, as expected. Although there is a large preponderance of acidic residues over basic ones (27 to ll), consistent with the low isoelectric point, 3.1 (McDowall, 1970), there is no obvious concentration of charge on any one region of the surface. Of particular interest in the structure of actinidin is the presence of one buried basic group (Lysl81) and no fewer than three buried acidic groups (Glu35, Glu50 and Glu52). None of these has any known functional role. Glu35, Glu50 and Lys181 all lie within the interface between domains I and II, along with Lysl7, partially buried at the end of the interface, and beyond it Glu86. Thus the charge on the two buried acid groups, Glu35 and Glu.50, is partly neutralized by Lysl7, and further neutralized by interaction with Lys181, which is linked to Glu35, not directly but through two water molecules. This complex arrangement is shown in Figure 10. Finney (1977)

has suggested that water molecules can have a charge-spreading role, and the interaction between Glu35 and Lysl81 seems to be a good example. The other buried acid group, the carboxyl group of Glu52, has no obvious positively charged partner. It lies in a partly hydrophobic environment, adjacent to the sidechains of Ile83 and Phe76. One oarboxyl oxygen receives a hydrogen bond from the main-chain amido group of residue 84, while the other is 2.66 A from a buried solvent molecule or ion, W4 (see Fig. 11). The latter was originally taken as a water molecule, but there is good reason to suppose it may actually be an ammonium ion. It has three hydrogen-bonding neighbours, within 3 A (52 OE2, 103 0, 105 0) but all are hydrogen-bond acceptors. Two more distant interactions (3.60 A and 3.70 A) are made by the carboxyl oxygen, Gal, of Asp80, and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen ion in this position, lying between of residue 82 (Fig. 11). A buried ammonium

Asp80 and Glu52, would neutralize the charge on the buried Glu52 nicely, and satisfy the hydrogen-bonding requirements of the groups around it. Most of the remaining charged side-chains are external, interacting with the solvent only, but structurally important interactions include those made by the side-chains of (1) Glu121, partly buried in a deep surface pocket, and hydrogen-bonded to NH(199) and NH(200) from an external loop, N,i of the buried Trp178, and an internal water molecule, W16; (2) Asp55, hydrogen-bonded to Gln51, Tyr89 and NH(96) (see Fig. 9); and (3) Arg195, which links Glu190 (2.9 A away on one side) and Glu172 ion pair interaction Glu172.. . (3.3 A away on the other side), giving a "double" Arg195...Glu190. There is only one other surface ion pair, AspG...Arg8. (v) Other polar side chains Very few are found completely buried in actinidin. Four (Ser29, Thr33, Ser134 and Ser183) are situated in the domain I-domain II interface (see below). In domain II, Asn182 is buried, surrounded by the side-chains of Trp184, Trp188, Phe144 and to the catalytically important His162. In domain I Ile164, and hydrogen-bonded only Ser49 is buried (hydrogen-bonded to CO(89)). Other polar side-chains, e.g. Gln51, lie in the molecular surface where, like Tyr89, Tyr147, Asp55 and Glu121, mentioned earlier, they have an important structural role, binding external sections of the polypeptide chain to the main part of the molecule (see e.g. Fig. 9). (f) The domain I-domain II interface

The polypeptide chain crosses between domains I and II in only three places, residues 16 to 22 crossing on one side of the molecule and 115 to 119 and 212 to 214 crossing on the other side (see Fig. 2). In between, there is an extensive interface between the two domains. The surprising feature of this interface is that its interior is mostly polar in nature, rather than non-polar. Only three non-polar side-chains are buried within it; Ala32 from domain I and Va1165 from domain II, which oppose each other across the interface (in papain these are Va132 and Ala162), and Pro132 from domain II which is adjacent to Gly36 from domain I. Non-polar groups also appear on the periphery of the interface (the side-chains of Ala163 and Ile70 on the top surface, Va114 and Leu45 on the bottom, Phe28 and the aliphatic chain of Lysl7 at one end, and Ile40, Ala12, Trp7 and part of the side-chain of Lys39 at the other), apparently shielding the polar interior from the external solution. Within the interface are the hydrogen-bonded side-chains of Ser29, Thr33 and Ser134, the charged side-chains of Lysl7, Lysl81, Glu35 and Glu50 (see previous section e(iv)) and a network of eight linked water molecules, hydrogen-bonded to each other and to protein atoms. These lie below the active site and extend along the interface from Ser183, approximately parallel to the central a-helix (24 to 43). Interactions within the interface are listed in Table 12. The water network, and its associated protein atoms, is shown in Figure 12 (a stereo diagram) and schematically in Figure 13. The internal water structure is also discussed in more detail below. There are several possible reasons for this distinctly polar interface. It is possible that the water molecules may just be trapped during folding, i.e. that the two domains

FIG. 13. A schematic representation of the network of 8 internal water molecules in the domaindomain interface. Each water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with 2 proton acceptors and either 1 or 2 proton donors; all water protons are thus utilized. The 4 charged side-chains, of Lysl7, LyslSl, Glu35 and Glu50, are also shown.

fold up independently, each with a polar exterior (one side of the helix 24 to 43 would then be on the outside of domain I, and side-chains such as Lys181, Glu35, Glu50 etc. would also be external), with associated water molecules; and that the water remains trapped, when the two domains mesh together. It may be, however, that the polar interior (and in particular the water molecules) has a functional importance. Lowe & Yuthavong (1971) have suggested that substrate binding should be accompanied by a widening of the active site cleft in papain, and this widening has been confirmed by crystallographic inhibitor binding studies (Drenth et al., 1975). Since papain contains a similar network of internal water molecules in the domaindomain interface, below the active site, it is possible that the more flexible, malleable structure provided by the water molecules allows the active site above it to be more elastic (perhaps to "breathe", oscillating between a wider and a narrower structure). It is interesting to note that in the serine proteases, elastase and chymotrypsin, most of the internal water molecules lie between the two p-barrels (Sawyer et al., 1978; Birktoft & Blow, 1972), a somewhat similar situation to that seen here. (g) The active site Although the active site remains qualitatively as originally described (Baker, 1977), shifts of 0.3 to 0.6 A during refinement have changed the detailed interpretation

significantly; the Cys25 S,. ..His162 N dl distance has been reduced by 0.6 A, the angle between the ring planes of His162 and Trp184 has changed by 20", and other distances and angles in the active site have been more actively described. The sulphur atom of the essential Cys25 lies close (3.30 A) to one nitrogen, Nor of His162, while the other nitrogen, NE2, is hydrogen-bonded (2.79 A) to OS1 of Asn182 (see Fig. 14). Asn182 is buried, in a non-polar environment, and the hydrogen bond 162 N E2...182 OS1 is shielded from the external solution by the indole ring of Trp184. The -NH, group of Asn182 is left without a hydrogen-bonding partner, and is directed inwards towards the plane of the aromatic ring of Trp188.

FIQ. 14. The catalytic site in actinidin. The sulphur atom (double circle) of Cys25 is 3-30 A from NaI of Hisl62, while N,, is hydrogen-bonded (2.79 A) to Gal of Asn182. The hydrogen bond is covered by the ring of Trp184. The 2 oxygen atoms of the oxidized sulphydryl group are shown, one of them hydrogen bonded to NH(25) and Gln19 Nea (i.e. in the "oxyanion hole"), the other hydrogen-bonded to NH( 163). The carboxyl group of Asp161 is turned away from the catalytic site, to hydrogen bond with NH(139).

The active site geometry is complicated by oxidation of the sulphydryl group, probably to SO, as in papain (Drenth et a2., 1975), during the time taken for crystallization and data collection (less than 10% of activity remains afterwards). One oxygen atom, 0,, is clearly visible, attached to S, of Cys25 (it was visible also in the original 2.8 A map as an elongation of the density for S,). It is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain amide of residue 25 (2.75 A away) and the side-chain -NH, group of Gln19 (3.24 A away), i.e. it occupies the "oxyanion hole" which forms the binding site for the carbonyl oxygen of a substrate molecule (Drenth et al., 1976). The same site is occupied by one of the oxygen atoms in oxidized papain (Drenth et al., 1976), and the presence of this stabilizing site, adjacent to S,, no doubt explains the very ready oxidation of sulphydryl proteases. The existence of a second oxygen atom, 0, attached to S, is less certain, In the present model, 0, has been placed in a weak extension of the density (see Big. 15), in a reasonable position (3.13 A from NH(163), and with the angle 01-S,-Oa = 117"). Difference maps, however, suggest slight disorder around the position of S,, and the placement of this second oxygen atom is somewhat uncertain as a result.

Attempts to obtain crystals of actinidin in the fully reduced form have not so far been successful. However, there is evidence that little change in structure accompanies oxidation. The original 2.8 L%multiple isomorphous replacement map was obtained from cryst'als with ~509; activity, yet, there was no sign of significant disorder, nor any significant difference in protein structure from that described here. Drenth et al. (1975,1976) have compared fully oxidized papain with papain that is a mixture of oxidized and reduced (with cysteine bound) forms; the only major difference was a rotation of the imidazole group of His159 by 30" about its C+& bond. The slight disorder in the position of Cys25 S, in actinidin still only gives a maximum uncertainty in position of 0.2 to 0.4 A. The arrangement of groups in the active site of actinidin generally supports the mechanism proposed by Drenth et al. (1975,1976). The plane of the imidazole ring of His162 makes an angle of 40" with the indole ring bf Trp184. In this orientation, Ndl points towards the position that would be occupied by the nitrogen atom of the leaving group during catalysis, and is therefore ideally arranged for proton transfer. The sulphur atom. S,, of Cys25 lies 2.7 .& out of the plane of the imidazole ring, so that no hydrogen bond would be possible even if the sulphur was not oxidized. A rotat,ion of 35" about C+Z$, of His162 would cause Cys25 S, to be coplanar with the imidazole ring, allowing a good S,,...Nd, hydrogen bond (distance -3.0 A). Furthermore, the rings of His162 and Trp184 would then be approximately parallel, about 3.5 A apart, giving additional stabilization. This is the structure proposed for free, reduced papain, in the absence of substrate (Drenth et al., 1976). Such a rotation would not disrupt the orientational His162. ..Asn182 hydrogen bond. Other features of the active site remain unchanged by refinement. The side-chain of GlnlQ is fixed by a hydrogen bond to the side-chain of Ser183 (19 O,,.. .183 O,, 2.66 A), leaving the -NH, group to project into the active site (see above). The carboxyl group of Asp161, sometimes implicated in kinetic mechanisms (e.g. Zannis & Kirsch, 1978; Angelides & Fink, 1978), is turned away from the active site, as in papain, so that it hydrogen bonds with t'he main-chain amido group of residue 139 (161 Ool... 139 N, 2.93 A). In this position it is -5.6 A from Nal of His162, and -7.1 -& from S, of Cys25. Rotation about C,--Co of Asp161 would not bring it appreciably closer.

Beyond the catalytic site (see Fig. 16) is the non-polar binding site for a substrate side-chain (the S, site, following the terminology of Berger & Schechter (1970)). In actinidin this is lined by the side-chains of Tyr69, Ile70, Ala136, Va1160, Ala163 and Met211. The side-chain of Met211 stretches across the end of this pocket, making it noticeably shorter than in papain. There are a number of water molecules in the active site cleft (see Fig. 16 and Table 13). However, with the exception of W77, attached to NC1 of Trp184, the only wellordered water molecules are those in and beyond the S, site. Otherwise only poorly ordered, weakly bound solvent is found in the catalytic site, suggesting that it does not have any important structural role in the catalytic mechanisms.

FIa. 16. The entire active site cleft in &tinidin. The catalytic site lies towards the right (the sulphur atom of Cys25 shown as a double circle). Towards the left is a non-polar pocket (the Sa site) flanked by the side-chains of Tyr69, Ile70, Ala136, Va1160, Ala163 and M&211. Well ordered water molecules are shown as filled circles, weakly bound, poorly ordered water molecules as half-filled circles.

(h) Solvent structure All solvent molecules or ions have been taken as water molecules except for W4 (probably an ammonium ion; see section (c)(iv), above). The 163 refined water molecules have been sorted, and numbered according to their B values, so that for water molecules Wl to W163 the serial number gives an indication of their reliability (Wl is the best-ordered, with B = 7.2 AZ). As the distribution in Figure 17 shows, many are very well-ordered, with B < 20 AZ, while the highest B value is only 40 AZ, less than those of the more mobile amino acid side-chains. The remaining 109 water molecules (W164 to W272) have not been refined and there is no significance in their serial numbers, except that all are less-ordered and less-reliable than those which have been refined. Water molecules are listed in Table 13, according to their environments in the structure. Also listed are hydrogen-bonding partners for all water molecules, hydrogen bonds being assumed where the contact distance is less than 3.3 A, and angles (e.g. in the case of protein NH groups) are reasonable. The best-ordered water molecules are those which are internal (all 17 internal waters have B < 15 A") but other wellordered water molecules are found either in crevices in the protein surface or at the contact areas between molecules in the crystal. Of the best 65 water molecules, with B < 25 AZ, 17 are internal, 20 are in surface pockets or crevices, 18 lie in inter-

molecular contact areas, and only 10 are classed as external (i.e. water molecules on or outside the protein surface, in contact with the main solvent areas in the crystal). Most of the external water molecules have fewer protein ligands and are significantly less-ordered than those bound in crevices, intermolecular sites, etc. Internal water molecules, having no contact with the external solution, have been found in other refined protein structures, e.g. there are 25 such in trypsin (Bode C% Schwager, 1975), and present indications are that they may be a common feature of proteins of this size. In actinidin the internal water molecules fall into two categories. Some (Wl, W4, W5, W8, W13, W15, W16, W17, W23) occupy discrete sites, in which a single water molecule occupies a small cavity and is bound exclusively to protein atom ligands. These water molecules fill otherwise empty spaces, and in doing so probably impart some extra stability to the structure by hydrogen-bonding with internal polar groups which would otherwise have no hydrogen-bonding partner (in each case at least one, and usually two, of the protein ligand atoms is in this situation). All nine of these discrete internal water molecules have either three or four protein ligands, two of which are invariably proton acceptors (16 out of 18 are carbonyl oxygens), the third a proton donor (usually backbone -NH), and the fourth, where present, is usually also a proton donor. The only exceptions are the ammonium ion W4 (3 oxygen ligands, all acceptors), and W15 (3 oxygen acceptors, 1 NH donor). Two typical discrete internal water sites are shown in Figure 18. One (W8) is three-co-ordinate. The other (Wl) has four ligands arranged approximately tetrahedrally, but has a fifth possible ligand (207 0) somewhat further away (3.33 8). Inspection of the geometry suggests that a bifurcated hydrogen may exist, one water proton being directed between 136 0 and 207 0. More "regular" five-co-ordinate water molecules (i.e. with 5 close neighbours) are not unusual (as has previously been noted in the crystal structure of rubredoxin (Watenpaugh et al., 1978)). Eleven such are listed in Table 13, and there are a number of four-co-ordinate waters which, like Wl, have a fifth neighbour only slightly more distant. The remaining eight internal water molecules are interconnected in a cluster at the centre of the domain-domain interface (Figs 12 and 13). Again, each has either

In (a) W8 has 3 ligands in an approximately trigonal arrangement, 2 proton acceptors (185 0 2.88 A; 192 0 2.91 A) and 1 proton donor (184 N 2.83 A). In (b) Wl haa 4 close neighbours, 2 proton acceptors (208 0 2.74 A; 136 0 2.87 A) and 2 proton donors (211 N 2.87 8; 136 N 3.14 A), as well as a 5th neighbour somewhat more distant (207 0 3.33 A). Three of the ligands (211 N, 208 0, 136 N) are tetrahedrally disposed and the 4th tetrahedral position lies between 136 0 and 207 0, suggesting a bifurcated hydrogen bond (the proton directed between 136 0 and 207 0).

three or four hydrogen-bonding partners, two being proton acceptors and the remaining one or two proton donors. Thus all water protons are utilized. Those waters with only three ligands generally have the fourth position blocked by a non-hydrogenbonding group. Most of the water molecules in this network have two or three protein ligands, but one (W19) in the centre of the cluster, is bound only to other waters. All the internal water molecules can be considered an integral part of the protein struct,ure, present also in solution. The same may also be true of some of the water

molecules bound in pockets on the surface. For example, W29 and W36 occupy a deep crevice between two antiparallel sections of polypeptide chain, 138 to 143 and 155 to 157 (see Fig. 19) and are probably essential to the structure. It will be interesting to see whether these and other water molecules occupying pockets formed mainly between main-chain atoms (e.g. W12, W18, W47) are found in papain as well (where the main-chain conformation is the same but many side-chains are different). Other tightly bound water molecules, e.g. W10 (see Fig. 19), W31 and W48, occupy pockets formed by polar side-chains. These help to stabilize the surface conformation of the molecule. A monolayer of water molecules covers most of the surface of the protein. Seldom is it more than one molecule thick, however, except at or near the points of intermolecular cont'act'. This simply reflects the fact that only the better-ordered water molecules can be identified as such, and where the protein surface is adjacent to a large body of liquid, the water structure rapidly becomes less-ordered. Of the 163

"best" water molecules (those that have been refined) only 13 are not hydrogenbonded to a protein atom. Of the 109 more poorly ordered waters (not refined) 42 have no protein ligand. Further, weaker, peaks can be seen in difference maps but are below the error level. As has been observed in other proteins (Finney, 1977) the more firmly bound surface water molecules sometimes act as "anchoring points" for further water molecules extending out from the protein surface. Many bridges occur between polar groups on the surface; the side-chains of Arg8 and Glu190 are linked by W83 and W176 (a water-mediated salt bridge?); W83, W156, and Wll6 form a bridge between Glu190 and Tyr177; and W76 and W84 form a bridge across the end of the domain I-domain II interface, covering the exposed edge of Phe28 in the process. More extensive networks fill shallow depressions in the protein surface. In several places networks of water molecules cover the protruding edges of non-polar side-chains. In domain II the edges of Phe152 and Tyr147 project out from the centre of a large loop of the polypeptide chain (residues 143 to 154) and are covered by a monolayer of eight water molecules (see Fig. 20). Similar clusters are seen covering the exposed

edges of the momattic rings of to atoms of the surrounding

edges of the aromatic rings of Phe76 and Tyr89. Where non-polar groups project more fully from the surface, water molecules are sometimes found to be arranged around them, but only when there are adjacent polar groups to which any such clusters can be anchored. Even then the water is not well-ordered. The largest hydrophobic patch on the surface (the side-chains of Va1200, Va1175, Leu197 and Ile151) is not associated with any ordered water; clearly the water structure is much more mobile around such regions. As in other protein structures, e.g. rubredoxin (Watenpaugh et al., 1978), bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975) and erythrocruorin (Steigemann & Weber, 1979), extensive networks of water molecules are found at the regions of contact between molecules in the crystal (see Table 13). Many of these water molecules may be present only as a consequence of the crystal packing, but some, interacting with several protein ligands, would certainly remain despite it.

Many good hydrogen bonds are made by these intermolecular water molecules, and undoubtedly contribute greatly to the stability of the crystal lattice. The number of intermolecular interactions involving water far outweigh direct interactions between protein atoms (see below). In general, the degree to which water molecules are ordered can be correlated with the number of hydrogen bonds they form with protein atoms. The "best" 54 water molecules (Wl to W54) have an average 2.2 protein ligands; the next 54 (W55 to W108) average 1.6; the next 55 (WlO9 to W163) average lel; while the remaining 109 average 0.8 protein ligands. Carbonyl oxygen atoms are by far the most common protein ligands for water molecules (al%), followed by main-chain NH groups (18%). Amongst side-chains, carboxyl groups hydrogen bond most often to water (39% of side-chain interactions involve carboxyl oxygens) but this partly reflects the large proportion of acidic side-chains in actinidin. It must be emphasized that the solvent structure described here only represents about 30% of the total water content of the crystals. More peaks can be seen (in difference maps), particularly further out from the protein surface; some may be real

along the z direction (residues 8 to 13, 15, 39 to 45, 88) ; region B, between residues 1 to 2, 120 to 125, and 198 to 202 of one molecule and 21, 66 and 92 to 99 of a symmetry-related molecule; and region C, involving residues 59 to 61, 75 to 80 and 101 to 107 of one molecule and the same residues (101 to 107, 75 to 80, 59 to 61) of a symmetry-related neighbour. Although actinidin has only a moderate solvent content (42% by vol.), only 20 side-chains make direct contacts (<4 A) with neighbouring molecules. There are several `(patches" of exposed non-polar side-chains on the surface, but none of these are involved in the intermolecular contacts; almost all the interactions are hydrogen bonds between polar side-chains or water bridges. Only a few of the water bridges (those involving single water molecules) are listed in Table 14. Most form complex networks. In general, intermolecular contacts seem likely to have little effect on the overall molecular structure, consistent with solution studies on other proteins (Rupley, 1969) and evidence from other crystal structures (Drenth, 1972). Nine carbonyl oxygens form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, but a preliminary comparison with the structure of papain shows that most of these have very similar orientations in the two proteins, despite different crystal packing. The active site is well removed from neighbouring molecules and should permit binding studies once crystals of the fully reduced enzyme can be prepared. The only intermolecular contact near this region involves one sidechain (Tyr69) which is part of the Sz site and is linked through a water molecule to a neighbouring molecule.
