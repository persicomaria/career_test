CALCIUM-BINDING ECHIDNA MILK LYSOZYME occupy a unique position in the evolution of the Class Mammalia. EML is the first monotreme or marsupial (i.e. non-euthefian) protein to have its three-dimensional structure determined. The amino-acid sequence of EML contains all of the residues which are found in the calcium-binding c-type lysozymes (Teahan et al., 1991) and EML is the first naturally occurring lysozyme to have its structure determined at high resolution with a bound atom of calcium. EML is unusual in that its carboxyl terminal is a cysteine residue; this feature is not found in any other mammalian lysozyme. The most N-terminal cysteine residue is thus far uniquely found at position 9 in EML instead of at position 6 as in all other c-type lysozymes. The consequences of calcium binding and these differences in primary and tertiary structures of EML provide points of interest for a crystal structure analysis. There are two variants of EML, designated as I and II, which are present in the milk of the Kangaroo Island, South Australia, echidna, T. a. multiaculeatus and the New South Wales (mainland) echidna, T. a. aculeatus, respectively (Teahan et al., 1991). EML I and II differ at three locations: 13V/A, 37S/G and 41R/Q. In this paper we present the structure of EML-I with a bound calcium ion refined at 1.9 ]~ resolution.

(Godovac-Zimmermann, Conti & Napolitano, 1988), dog, cat and hooded seal, (Grobler, Rao, Pervaiz & Brew, 1994) as well as echidna (Teahan, McKenzie, Shaw & Griffiths, 1991). It is generally assumed that all these lysozymes bind calcium, but so far this has been unequivocally demonstrated only for the equine, pigeon and canine enzymes. What is the role of calcium in o~-lactalbumin and in some lysozymes? Calcium is not located in the region of the protein thought to be involved in galactosyltransferase binding (Malinovskii, Tian, Grobler & Brew, 1996; Pike et al., 1996), but may modify the kinetics of the reaction (Musci & Berliner, 1985). Calcium may protect o~-lactalbumin from thermal denaturation (Hiraoka et al., 1980) and act as a regulator of folding and disulfide bond formation (Rao & Brew, 1989). Since the c~-lactalbumins of all species investigated have all the amino-acid residues required for calcium binding, it would be difficult to argue that calcium is not important for this protein, but the same argument cannot be applied to lysozymes. There is agreement in the literature that o~-lactalbumins and c-type lysozymes are derived from a common ancestor (Nitta & Sugai, 1989; Shewale, Sinha & Brew, 1984; McKenzie & White, 1991) and that o~-lactalbumins arose by gene duplication from an ancestral lysozyme. The precise time of the gene duplication event is, however, still disputed. More recent studies, including the discovery of calciumbinding lysozymes and the sequencing of marsupial and monotreme proteins, have provided new evidence for the debate but have not resolved the question of whether the calcium-binding lysozymes are the genuine ancestors of the oMactalbumins (Grobler et al., 1994; Nitta & Sugai, 1989). A number of structural studies have been undertaken with the aim of characterizing the calcium binding site in calcium-binding lysozymes. Horse and pigeon lysozymes have been crystallized and their structures have been determined at 2.5 A (Tsuge et al., 1992) and 3.0]k resolution (Yao, Tanaka, Hikichi & Nitta, 1991), respectively, but so far the only high-resolution structural analysis of a calcium-binding lysozyme is that of a human lysozyme with an engineered calcium binding site. The double mutant Q86D/A92D human enzyme was studied in the calcium-bound and calciumfree form and compared with the structure of the wildtype enzyme (Inaka, Kuroki, Kikuchi & Matsushima, 1991). The calcium binding site was very similar to that found in o~-lactalbumin. The effect of calcium binding was to cause a minor rearrangement of the side chains in the calcium-binding loop and the displacement of a water molecule from the site. No other significant changes were observed. Echidna milk lysozyme (EML) is an attractive candidate for structural study. Echidnas are members of the Order Monotremata and, as egg-laying mammals,

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Isolation of echidna lysozyme I

Milk samples from free-living lactating echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus multiaculeatus) were collected on Kangaroo Island, South Australia as described previously (Gfiffiths, Green, Leckie, Messer & Newgrain, 1984) and stored at 253 K for up to 6 months and then at 193 K for 2 years. Three samples collected from two echidnas in 1991 were pooled (20 g), diluted with 20 ml of 50 mM Tfis-HC1 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 M KC1 and centrifuged at 40 000g (60 min, 277 K). The fat was discarded and the supernatant (whey) was concentrated to 16ml by centrifugation using micro-concentrators with 3000 molecular weight cutoff (Microsep TM, Filtron Technology Corp, MA, USA). Lysozyme has been previously isolated from echidna whey by a one-step procedure involving Hepafin-Sepharose chromatography (Teahan et al., 1991). In this work, in which maximum purity of the lysozyme was considered desirable, the following four-step procedure was adopted. The echidna whey was applied to a column (2.5 x l l 8 c m ) of Sephadex G-100 (Pharmacia) and eluted with 50mM Tris-HC1/0.1 M KC1 (pH 7.4). The whey proteins resolved into four peaks of which only the fourth, containing the low molecular weight proteins, exhibited lysozyme activity as determined by a turbidometric method (Weisner, 1984). The column fractions constituting peak 4 were combined, concentrated to 6 ml as described above and applied to a column (1.6 × 40 cm) of DEAE-Sephadex

(Pharmacia) equilibrated with 5 0 m M Tris-HC1 pH 7.4. All of the lysozyme activity eluted with the initial, unretarded protein peak (c.f. Shaw, Messer, Scrivener, Nicholas & Griffiths, 1993), the contents of which were combined and filtered through a small column (1.0 x 6.0cm) of Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated with 5 mM barbital sodium buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 0 m M NaC1. The column was washed with buffer solution to remove unbound proteins, after which the bound proteins were eluted using a linear salt gradient to 1.0M NaC1 (Teahan et al., 1991). This yielded a single unsymmetrical protein peak eluting between 0.15 and 0 . 3 0 M NaC1. Examination by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Shaw et al., 1993) showed that although lysozyme was present throughout this peak, the leading-edge fractions were contaminated with proteins of higher molecular weight. These fractions were discarded while the others were pooled, concentrated, diluted with starting buffer and re-chromatographed on Heparin-Sepharose as above. The column fractions which contained only lysozyme protein (SDS-PAGE) were pooled and dialysed for 24 h against a slight molar excess of CaCI2 using dialysis tubing with 6000-8000 molecular weight cutoff; this was followed by dialysis (24 h) against three changes of ultrapure water (18 M~2) and freeze-drying. The final yield of freeze-dried EML I was 24.5 mg. 2.2. Crystallization and data collection Crystals of EML were grown in 6~tl hanging drops initially containing a 1:1 mixture of protein solution and well solution (protein solution: 10 mg m1-1 protein, 1 0 m M citrate, pH 4.5; well solution: 0.05 M KHzPOa/KzHPO4, pH 7.4, 20% PEG 8000). These conditions are one of the set represented in a modification of a published sparse-matrix screen (Jancarik & Kim, 1991). Elongated flat-plate crystals grew up to 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm in one week at room temperature.

The pH in the drop after the crystals had grown was measured to be 6.34. All data were recorded on an RAXIS IIc imaging-plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator with a Cu Ko~ target, operating at 5 0 k V 1 0 0 m A with a 0 . 3 m m cathode. The X-ray beam was monochromated and focused with a mirror system incorporating a 0.00038 cm Ni filter originally developed by Zbyszek Otwinowski and Gerald Johnson at Yale University, supplied by MSC Corporation, Texas. Diffraction data were recorded from two crystals to a resolution of 1.9 A for one crystal and to 2 . 2 A for the other using a crystal-to-imageplate distance of 100 mm. The data were processed with the HKL suite of programs, DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). No reflections were omitted from the data because they were weak. The crystals are monoclinic, space group P21, with unit-cell dimensions. a = 37.1, b = 42.0, c = 38.1 ~ , / 3 = 91 ° and Z = 2, obtained from the average values found from the two crystals. The scaling and merging statistics are give n in Table 1. The final data set comprises 8418 unique reflections corresponding to 90% of the possible data to 1.9/~ resolution. 2.3. Structure solution and refinement The structure of EML was determined using molecular replacement with a model for echidna lysozyme derived from the structure of hen egg-white lysozyme [HEWL; Protein Data Bank entry, 4LYZ; (Diamond, 1974)] by making the necessary amino-acid changes using INSIGHT software (MSI/Biosym Inc, 1993). The sequences were aligned as shown in Fig. 1 following the alignment published by Acharya et al. (Acharya, Stuart, Phillips, McKenzie & Teahan, 1994). Atoms in the EML model with no direct equivalents in H E W L were omitted from the initial calculations of structure factors. This model was then subjected to a molecular dynamics/energy minimization protocol with the program X-PLOR (Briinger, 1992) prior to the molec-

There are also two shorter 310 helices: Cys80-Leu83 and (Table 2). The calcium ion was identified with the largest peak Ser121-Phe123. The smaller domain contains a threein a difference Fourier synthesis (Fig. 2) at an early stage stranded antiparallel fl-sheet formed from the central in the structure analysis, more than 10o- and twice the portion of the sequence, residues 41-79 (Fig. 3).

3.1. Quality of the structure The quality of the structure was assessed using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski, MacArthur, Moss & Thornton, 1993). In a Ramachandran plot, not shown, (Ramachandran, Ramakrishnan & Sasisekharan, 1963), 90.1% of residues have backbone torsion angles in most favoured regions. No residues lie in disallowed or generously allowed regions of the plot. Other measures of quality applied by PROCHECK indicate that the refined parameters, including aJ-angle standard deviation, bad contacts, chirality, hydrogen-bond energy and side-chain torsion angles are better or inside the limits derived from well refined structures of comparable resolution. The theoretical estimate of coordinate errors using a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) is 0.2 It, and 0.18 ~k from SIGMAA (Read, 1990).
3.2. Overall structure and the catalytic active site The structure of EML (Fig. 3) shows the fold which is known to be archetypal for c-type lysozymes and for a-lactalbumins. The structure is comprised of two domains. The larger domain, predominantly a-helical, is composed of polypeptide segments from the N- and C-terminal regions, residues 1-40 and 80-125, respectively. An analysis of the structure using

3.3. The calcium ion binding site The calcium ion is centred in a loop of the polypeptide formed by residues 82-91 (Fig. 4) and is coordinated by the side-chain carboxyl groups of three aspartic acid residues, two main-chain carbonyl groups and two water molecules (Fig. 4; Table 3). The atoms which coordinate the calcium ion form a remarkably regular pentagonal bipyramid (Table 3). The atoms forming the central plane of the bipyramid, Asp85 O 61, A s p 9 0 0 62, Asp91 O ~2, Wat128 O and W a t l 3 0 0 , deviate from a least-squares plane drawn through the atoms by -0.010, 0.017, -0.022, 0.021 and -0.005/~, respectively. The calcium ion lies 0.04/~, from this plane. The angles at the calcium ion formed by adjacent ligand atoms in the ring range from 66 to 77 ° compared with the ideal value of 72 ° for a regular pentagon (Table 3). The apical calcium-ligand bonds are nearly perpendicular to the central plane. 3.4. Comparison with other lysozyme structures While the overall structure of EML closely resembles those of other members of the c-type lysozyme family there are some notable differences (Figs. 5 and 6). There are displacements of C a positions of up to 5/~ when the structure of EML is superimposed on that of HEWL. The largest differences occur at the carboxy terminus

based on sequence homology with other lysozymes and oL-lactalbumins (Acharya et al., 1994). They used HEWL as a starting structure for their echidna lysozyme model. The calcium-binding loop and the loops 19-26 and 31-33 were based on the structure of human o~-lactalbumin. A comparison of their model for echidna lysozyme and the structure reported here (Fig. 6c) reveals that the model captured the important features of the structure, including the movement at the carboxyl terminus. While the model failed to position correctly residue 103 the authors noted in their paper that region 101-103 forms an external loop and in spite of poor amino-acid sequence agreement was built as in hen egg-white lysozyme. These gross features of the model structure were correctly predicted because of the implications of changes in the sequence, notably the position of the disulfide bonds. The next step in the modelling procedure which involved energy minimization might be said to have been less successful. Fig. 6 reveals that the model of echidna lysozyme more closely resembles HEWL (r.m.s.d. for C a atoms is 0.82 A) than it does the actual structure of echidna lysozyme EML (r.m.s.d. for C a atoms is 1.18 ]k). The structure which most closely resembles EML is PEWL (r.m.s.d. for C a atoms is 1.03 ,~). This is not surprising since the lysozyme sequence which is closest to echidna is pigeon (Grobler et al., 1994), despite their distant evolutionary relationship. In fact PEWL has most of the eccentric characteristics of EML, including the short C-terminal strand terminating in a cysteine residue and the calcium-binding loop, and only lacks the shift in the sequence of the most N-terminal cysteine.

4. Concluding remarks
This study has confirmed that echidna milk lysozyme is a calcium-binding protein. Perhaps the most important

finding is that calcium binding has almost no effect on its structure, confirming the observations made for the calcium-bound and calcium-free forms of a double mutant form of human lysozyme in which residues 86 and 92 were replaced by aspartates (Kuroki et al., 1989). Other than changes to side-chain orientations directly associated with calcium binding, there were no significant changes to the backbone of the calcium-binding loop (Inaka et al., 1991). The demonstration that human lysozyme, which has only one of the calcium-binding aspartates (at position 91) could be transformed to bind calcium simply by changing two residues to aspartates suggests that the necessary and sufficient condition for the ability of echidna lysozyme to bind calcium seems to be to have aspartate residues at positions 85, 90 and 91 (EML numbering). It is of interest that the human D86/92 lysozyme was more stable against thermal denaturation and protease digestion than the native lysozyme (Kuroki et al., 1989). In addition, the removal of calcium from the mutant enzyme decreased its stability, possibly because it resulted in electrostatic repulsion between Asp86 and Asp91 (Inaka et al., 1991). A possible implication of these observations is that during the evolution of the non-stomach c-type lysozymes, loss of calcium binding through a mutation involving replacement of one of the three essential aspartates would be hindered by the fact that the product would be less stable. Conversely, acquisition of calcium binding by a non-calcium binding lysozyme might be favoured because the product would be more stable. It has been proposed (Grobler et al., 1994) that calcium-binding activity is an ancient feature of the lysozyme-o~-lactalbumin superfamily which has been lost from the non-calcium-binding gene line; however, this seems improbable if the loss of calcium significantly decreases the stability of these proteins under physiological conditions. In that case it would seem more likely that calcium-binding lysozymes such

the C a atoms of the cysteine residues are quite far apart (Fig. 5). In general, the carboxy terminal strand of EML more closely resembles that of HALB than of HEWL, despite a greater sequence similarity to the latter. Another significant difference between EML and HEWL occurs at Lys 103 which lies on the link between the third and fourth c~-helices at the open end of the active-site cleft. The equivalent region in pigeon eggwhite lysozyme (PEWL) is very similar to that in EML. Another difference between HEWL and EML which is significant but not as large as those already mentioned involves the region from residues 4 to 20 (Fig. 6a). In this region EML is also different from PEWL (Fig. 6b) and PEWL and HEWL are also different from each other, implying that this whole region is free to move with respect to the remainder of the structure. Calcium binding is accommodated with little or no effect on the structure. Specifically, the structure of the calcium-binding loop in EML and the equivalent residues in HEWL are very similar (Fig. 4), implying that calcium binding does not significantly alter the backbone conformation of the enzyme. Calcium binding also appears to have little or no effect on the mobility of the protein as measured by the B values. The loop which binds the calcium shows only a slightly elevated average B value in common with other loops. 3.5. Molecular modelling of

and in the loop centred on residue 103. The former is a result of the shortening of the polypeptide chain and the relative movement of the Cys9 Cys125 disulfide bond and the associated polypeptide backbone (Fig. 5). It is of interest that while the S atoms of this disulfide bond in HEWL and HALB superimpose almost exactly,
