Bacterial and archaeal endo-b-1,3-glucanases that belong to glycoside hydrolase family 16 share a b-jelly-roll fold, but differ significantly in sequence and in substrate specificity. The crystal structure of the laminarinase (EC 3.2.1.39) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus ° (pfLamA) has been determined at 2.1 A resolution by molecular replacement. The pfLamA structure reveals a kink of six residues (72­77) at the entrance of the catalytic cleft. This peptide is absent in the endoglucanases from alkaliphilic Nocardiopsis sp. strain F96 and Bacillus macerans, two proteins displaying an overall fold similar to that of pfLamA, but with different substrate specificity. A deletion mutant of pfLamA, lacking residues 72­75, hydrolyses the mixed-linkage b-1,3-1,4-glucan lichenan 10 times more efficiently than the wild-type protein, indicating the importance of the kink in substrate preference.

Depolymerization of polysaccharides is catalysed by highly specific enzymes that promote hydrolysis of the scissile glycosidic bond by an activated water molecule. The b-1,3-glucan, the main polysaccharide of algal and fungal cell walls, is hydrolysed by a class of enzymes known as b-1,3-glucanases [1]. On the basis of their enzymatic activity, the glucanases can play various physiological roles. In plants, these proteins may exert a protective role against fungal pathogens because they hydrolyse the fungal cell wall. Moreover, their expression in plant seeds plays an important role in the regulation of seed

germination and dormancy and in the defence against pathogens [2]. In viruses, b-1,3-glucanases degrade the host cell wall either during virus entry or virus release [3]. In bacteria, two types of endoglucanase with closely related specificity and a high degree of homology have been identified: endo-b-1,3-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.39) and endo-b-1,3-1,4-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.73) [4]. Endo-b-1,3glucanases hydrolyse b-1,3-glucans, such as laminarin, with high efficiency. By contrast, endo-b-1,3-1,4-glucanases may also hydrolyse polysaccharides containing b-1,4 linkages, such as lichenan, only when the glucosyl residue engaged with the O4 atom in the b-1,4 linkage is

also engaged with the O3 atom in a b-1,3 linkage [4,5]. Endo-b-1,3- and endo-b-1,3-1,4-glucanases have been considered for several biotechnological applications [6]. The laminarinase from Pyrococcus furiosus (pfLamA) was the first endo-b-1,3-glucanase isolated from a heterotrophic hyperthermophilic archaeon, which grows optimally at 100 °C on a wide range of carbohydrate substrates, including starch, maltose and cellobiose [4]. pfLamA belongs to the subfamily laminarinase in glycoside hydrolase family 16, according to a sequence-based classification [7]. This protein, which appears to be the most thermostable endo-b-1,3-glucanase detected so far, also exhibits extreme stability against chemical and physical denaturation [8]. The enzyme structure is well preserved under extreme conditions, such as 95 °C at pH 3.0 and 7.9 m guanidinium [9], and can still interact with calcium with a consistent recovery of tertiary structure in 7.9 m guanidinium [10]. In this study, the structure of pfLamA was deter° mined at 2.1 A resolution by X-ray diffraction, and compared with the structures of homologous family 16 endoglucanases from alkaliphilic Nocardiopsis sp. strain F96 (BglF) [11] and Bacillus macerans [H(A16-M)] [12], which display an overall fold similar to that of pfLamA, but with different substrate preference. On the basis of the amino acid sequence, BglF exhibits the highest homology to the family 16 endob-1,3-glucanases. However, in contrast with the other endo-b-1,3-glucanases, this enzyme shows more than eightfold greater activity toward a b-1,3-1,4-glucan rather than b-1,3-glucans [13], thus suggesting a preference of Bg1F for the hydrolysis of b-1,4 bonds. The knowledge of the pfLamA three-dimensional structure has allowed the identification of the structural features that determine its substrate specificity as well as its unusual stability. On this basis, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to study the structural determinants of the substrate preference of pfLamA.

Results
Structure solution and crystal packing pfLamA crystallizes in two different crystal forms: (a) primitive monoclinic P21 with the following cell dimen° ° ° sions: a = 44.36 A, b = 84.76 A, c = 69.23 A, a = 90.00°, b = 104.97°, c = 90.00°; (b) centred monoclinic ° C2 with the following cell dimensions: a = 121.80 A, ° ° b = 72.81 A, c = 91.67 A, a = 90.000°, b = 100.22°, c = 90.000°. The best crystal belongs to the former ° space group and diffracts at 2.1 A resolution (Table 1). The dataset collected from this crystal was used to

determine the protein structure by molecular replacement using BglF as search model [11] [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 2HYK]. According to the blast structural alignment, the two proteins show an identity of 46% (118 / 255 residues) (Fig. 1A). The final model contains two identical subunits that represent the asymmetric unit content and are related by a twofold symmetry axis. Each monomer contains 263 residues (34­297), one calcium ion and one 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). The final model contains 125 water molecules. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in PDB (accession code 2VY0). Overall structure The overall fold of pfLamA is similar to that described for BglF [11], although it displays different structural features. As in BglF, it consists of a classical sandwich-like b-jelly-roll motif formed by the face-to-face packing of two antiparallel sheets which, in pfLamA, contain seven (b2­b5­b14­b7­b8­b9­b10) and eight

The secondary structural elements of pfLamA and BglF are indicated: the b strands forming the external b sheet are coloured green, the b strands forming the internal b sheet are coloured blue and the 310 helices are coloured magenta. The four residues, IAYG, removed in the Dloop variant are underlined, the residues forming a salt bridge are indicated in bold and those involved in the formation of an ion pair network are shown in bold highlighted in grey. The charged residues buried and involved in a salt bridge are shown in red bold and those buried and involved in an ion pair network are indicated in red bold highlighted in grey. The residues involved in calcium binding are highlighted in cyan. pfLamA is 38 residues longer than BglF at the N-terminus; however only five of these residues are present in the structure, as the protein used for the crystallization trials lacked the first 33 residues, indicated in italic.

In pfLamA, b15 (residues 282­296) at the C-terminus is four residues longer than in BglF, so that this strand interacts not only with b4 and b1, as in BglF, but also with an additional strand at the N-terminus (b0). This interaction, absent in BglF, may contribute to the greater stability of pfLamA. The major differences between the two proteins are found

in the structural elements connecting the b strands. In particular, in pfLamA, which lacks a b3 strand, b2 and b4 are connected by a loop 30 residues long. This region, compared with BglF, contains six additional residues (residues 72­77), forming a kink located at the entrance of the catalytic cleft. Interestingly, this kink, which is also absent in H(A16-M) (PDB accession code 1U0A) [12], is flanked by two small 310

helices. Moreover, in pfLamA, the loop connecting b4 and b5 is four residues longer than that in BglF, the region connecting b9 and b10 is folded in a four-residue 310 helix (g1b), which is absent in BglF, and, finally, the g2 helix, which is located between b10 and b11 in BglF, is absent in pfLamA (Fig. 1B). Calcium binding site The pfLamA X-ray structure contains one calcium ion for each monomer. The calcium ion is located on the opposite side with respect to the catalytic cleft (Figs 1B and 2). The calcium ion is coordinated by residues of the loop connecting the b1 and b2 strands, and by the glycine residue (Gly97) placed at the end of the long region connecting b2 and b4 (Fig. 2). The site is fully occupied and calcium is coordinated with nearly perfect rectangular-bipyramidal geometry on the convex face of the protein. The ligands are the three backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly97, Asp287 and Glu53, the carboxyl side-chain oxygen (OD1) of Asp287, the carboxyl side-chain oxygen of Glu55 and two water molecules (Fig. 2). The carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly97 and the water molecule hydrogen bonded to Glu53 occupy the apex positions, and the other atoms are arranged in the plane. Comparison between pfLamA, BglF and H(A16-M) structures The structure of pfLamA was compared with those of BglF (Fig. 3) and H(A16-M) (Fig. 4).

° degree of identity (46%), yields an rmsd of 0.85 A. As shown in Fig. 4, H(A16-M) also displays the same fold as pfLamA, despite the low degree of identity (< 23%). In fact, the superposition of pfLamA and ° H(A16-M) structures yields an rmsd of 1.65 A (a value acceptable for proteins sharing the same fold). Superposition of the pfLamA structure with that of H(A16M) carrying the substrate tetrasaccharide [12], and of BglF, reveals that the main difference between pfLamA and the other two glucanases is at the entrance of the catalytic cleft, where the P. furiosus protein displays a six-residue kink (72­77), including residues Ile72, Ala73, Tyr74 and Gly75 (Figs 3B and 4B). As shown in Fig. 3B, Tyr74 is part of a hydrogen-bonding network involving Arg161, Glu126, Lys124 and Glu67

which may play an important role in protein stabilization. Moreover, in pfLamA, the kink in the conformation found in the crystal structure disallows the binding of a b-1,3-1,4-glucan tetrasaccharide, because the Tyr74 residue clashes on the sugar non-reducing end of the b-1,3-1,4-glucan tetrasaccharide of the superposed H(A16-M) structure (Fig. 4B); however, this kink allows the binding of a b-1,3 laminarin trisaccharide (Fig. 5B). A pfLamA deletion mutant (Dloop), which lacks the four residues Ile72, Ala73, Tyr74 and Gly75, was obtained to test the role of the kink in pfLamA substrate selectivity (see below). Only four

Secondly, the b-1,3glucan (having the same glycosidic bonds as the pfLamA natural substrate) bound to dectin-1 (PDB ID: 2cl8) [44] was imported into the pfLamA structure after least-squares fitting of the co-ordinates of the first two sugar molecules to those of the previously imported b-1,3-1,4-glucan tetrasaccharide.

auxiliary residues providing structural and functional support for productive substrate binding and transition-state stabilization [12]. pfLamA was crystallized in the presence of MPD. Interestingly, MPD was found in the catalytic cleft (Fig. 5A). The O2 of MPD is hydrogen bonded to the OE2 of the putative acid / base ° catalyst Glu175 (distance, 3.5 A), whereas O1 is hydrogen bonded to Asn81 and Arg122. A laminarin trisaccharide was modelled in the protein catalytic cleft to study the possible interactions of laminarin with pfLamA (Fig. 5B). The catalytic cleft of the hyperthermophilic endo-b-1,3-glucanase is closely similar to those of BglF [11] (Fig. 3) and H(A16-M) [12] (Fig. 4). In particular, the residues lining the subsites +I and )I, where the hydrolytic reaction takes place, as well as the conformations of the nucleophilic residue (Glu170 in pfLamA) [14] and the putative general acid / base catalytic residue (Glu175 in pfLamA), are conserved (Fig. 5). Moreover, the interactions necessary to correctly position the sugar rings in BglF and H(A16-M) are also present in the active site pocket of pfLamA (Fig. 5B). Figure 5 shows the residues which, in pfLamA, are possibly involved in the hydrogenbonding network allowing polysaccharide binding: Asp172, which may form a hydrogen bond with the O1 of the glucose ring in position ­I (O­OD1 = ° 3.72 A), and Asn81, which may form a hydrogen bond with the O6 of the same glucose ring. In addition, pfLamA contains, at the ­I and ­II subsites, four conserved tryptophan residues, Trp154, Trp150, Trp165 and Trp79 (Fig. 5), important for the stabilization of the transition state [11,12] during the hydrolysis reaction, and conserved in BglF (Fig. 1A). Although BglF has been reported to prefer b-1,3-1,4-glucans as a substrate [13], pfLamA is significantly more active towards b-1,3-glucan [4]; this selectivity may be due to the kink placed at the entrance of the catalytic cleft, corresponding to residues 72­77 (Figs 3 and 4), in the middle of the loop which connects strands b2 and b4 (Fig. 1A). Catalytic activity of wild-type pfLamA and the Dloop mutant The catalytic activities of wild-type pfLamA and the Dloop variant, which lacks the loop residues Ile72, Ala73 and Gly75 flanking Tyr74 on either side (Fig. 4), with laminarin (a b-1,3-glucan) as substrate were determined and compared with the hydrolysis of lichenan (a b-1,3-1,4-glucan) at different temperatures. Notably, pfLamA preferentially utilizes b-1,3-glucan as substrate, whereas BglF shows over eightfold greater activity towards b-1,3-1,4-glucan than b-1,3-glucan

Table 2. Catalytic activity of wild-type pfLamA and the Dloop variant with laminarin and lichenan substrates. Enzyme activity on laminarin and lichenan was measured in 100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5, for 10 min at 40, 70 and 80 °C. The substrate concentration was 5 mgÆmL)1. Each assay was performed at 0.63 lgÆmL)1 enzyme concentration.

[11], a substrate preference opposite to that of pfLamA [4]. It appears that, in the Dloop variant, the efficiency of degradation of the mixed b-1,3-1,4-linked lichenan at 40 and 70 °C is increased significantly with respect to degradation by the wild-type, and is comparable with the efficiency in the hydrolysis of the all b-1,3linked laminarin (Table 2). Indeed, the Dloop carries the deletion containing residues 72­75 that belong to the kink at the entrance of the pfLamA catalytic cleft (Figs 3B and 4B), a peculiarity with respect to BglF which may contribute to the substrate selectivity towards b-1,3-glucan. At 80 °C, the specific activity of the Dloop mutant is reduced significantly relative to that of the wild-type with both substrates, thus suggesting that the deletion of the four residues affects significantly the thermoactivity of pfLamA. Structural determinants of pfLamA stability Based on the structural alignment in Fig. 1A, pfLamA and BglF have 118 identical residues over 255 aligned (46%). The percentage sequence identity over the structurally aligned residues calculated by SSM (http:// www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/cgi-bin/ssmserver) is 52%. The high similarity between the mesophilic and hyperthermophilic phenotypes allows the structural features of pfLamA which may contribute to its peculiar thermal and chemical stability to be highlighted [15]. Many hyperthermostable proteins show an increase in the number of buried hydrophobic residues at the protein core [16,17], accompanied by an extended exposure of hydrophilic and charged residues at the protein surface, which may contribute to the solubility of the protein, thus increasing its stability [18­20]. The number of buried hydrophobic residues is increased in pfLamA, 123 versus 85 in BglF, similar to the results reported for several other hyperthermophilic proteins [21­24]. In pfLamA, the accessible surface area is more

polar, the number of charged amino acid residues at the protein surface is 38 versus 30 present in BglF, and the number of hydrophobic and uncharged hydrophilic residues exposed to the solvent is 107 versus 153 in BglF. The number of surface-accessible acidic residues in pfLamA and BglF is the same, whereas the number of surface-accessible basic residues is increased from eight to 17 in the hyperthermophilic enzyme. In pfLamA, most of the charged residues are paired in ionic interactions and the total number of ion pairs (11) is almost double that in the mesophilic counterpart (six) (Fig. 1A). The number of charged amino acid residues buried in the core is 23 in pfLamA, more than double that (10) in BglF. In both structures, onehalf of the buried charged residues are paired and, amongst the unpaired charged residues, acidic residues are prevalent. Charged residues and ionic interactions An increased number of ion pairs, i.e. two interacting ° charged non-hydrogen atoms at a distance up to 4.0 A [25], and larger ionic networks are the most common features that distinguish hyperthermophilic proteins from their mesophilic counterparts [19,26­29]. In pfLamA, the number of ion pairs is almost doubled in comparison with that in BglF (Fig. 1A). The number of ionic interactions between two charged groups located at the surface of pfLamA is eight, two more than that observed in BglF, and they are widely distributed on the protein. The ion pair Arg290-Glu53 is formed by the buried Arg290 and the exposed Glu53, which is also involved in calcium binding through its carbonyl moiety (Fig. 2). The main difference between the hyperthermophilic and mesophilic enzymes is the presence, in pfLamA, of two additional three-residue (Arg104-Glu102-Lys283) and four-residue (Glu67Lys124-Glu126-Arg161) ionic networks. Notably, these two networks connect the surface of the protein with its internal core, as they are formed between charged residues buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein (Glu102, Glu67 and Lys124) and charged residues exposed to the solvent (Fig. 1A). Aromatic interactions The definition of an aromatic interaction is based on ° the use of a cut-off distance of 7 A between the aromatic ring centres [30]. In pfLamA, the number of aromatic residues is 42, identical to that of BglF; in addition, the ratio between those exposed on the surface and those buried in the core is very similar. Hence, a comparison of the actual interactions of the
1054

aromatic residues in the two endoglucanases may reveal the structural determinants that contribute to the peculiar stability of the hyperthermophilic enzyme [30,31]. Indeed, the number of clusters of aromatic interactions is eight in pfLamA and five in BglF; in pfLamA, four of the eight clusters are formed by at least three aromatic residues, and one cluster, conserved in BglF, is formed by five residues (Phe54, Trp64, Tyr63, Trp50, Phe131). Five of the eight clusters in pfLamA display aromatic interactions with residues at increasing degree of exposure to the solvent, thus bridging the buried core of the protein directly to its surface.

Discussion
In this paper, the structure of the endo-b-1,3-glucanase pfLamA is presented and compared with that of the endo-b-1,3-1,4-glucanase homologues BglF [11,13] and H(A16-M) [12]. The X-ray structure of pfLamA discloses the structural elements responsible for substrate specificity and points to a six-residue kink (72­77) as the main structural difference between pfLamA and the endo-b-1,3-1,4-glucanases. Moreover, the structural analysis reported here allows the identification of the specific tertiary interactions determining the major stability of this thermophilic protein with respect to the mesophilic endo-b-glucanases. The overall fold of pfLamA consists of a classical sandwich-like b-jelly-roll motif formed by the face-to-face packing of two antiparallel sheets containing seven and eight strands, respectively, and is similar to that of the homologous BglF (Fig. 1). Interestingly, despite the high amino acid sequence homology to family 16 endo-b-1,3-glycosyl hydrolases, BglF shows more than eightfold greater activity towards the b-1,3-1,4-glucan rather than the b-1,3-glucan [11,13], an opposite substrate preference with respect to pfLamA, which prefers the b-1,3-glucan as substrate [4]. The active site of glycosyl hydrolases has evolved to efficiently perform hydrolysis of the scissile glycosidic bond which, in the case of endoglucanases, involves a nucleophile, a general acid / base catalyst and a number of auxiliary residues [12]. The substrate binding site of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes has been extensively described for the H(A16-M) E105Q / E109Q protein, in which both the nucleophile (Glu105) and the general acid / base (Glu109) have been mutated to the isosteric glutamine residues to obtain the structure of the complex with a b-glucan tetrasaccharide [12]. The conformation of the catalytic cleft is well conserved in the b-1,3-glucanases, particularly for those residues lining sites +I and ­I, where

the hydrolytic reaction takes place. In pfLamA, the nucleophilic residue Glu170 [14] [Glu105 in H(A16M)] and the putative general acid / base catalytic residue Glu175 [Glu109 in H(A16-M)] are conserved. Moreover, all the interactions necessary to correctly position the glucose ring are conserved. The only difference concerns the presence of a six-residue kink (residues 72­77) placed at the entrance of the catalytic tunnel and absent in the other endoglucanases (Figs 3B and 4B). As shown in Fig. 4B, the residues forming the kink, in particular Tyr74, disallow the entrance of the b-1,4-polysaccharides in the catalytic cleft, but mixed-linkage b-1,3-1,4-glucans are tolerated, albeit with lower affinity [4]. In addition, in pfLamA, the binding of b-1,3 sugars is favoured by the conformation of the 310 helix (160­163), which is more open than that in H(A16-M) (Fig. 4). To verify the functional effects of the residues forming the kink in substrate recognition, a deletion mutant was prepared. Dloop, which lacks residues Ile72, Ala73, Tyr 74 and Gly75, was designed to build an enzyme similar to BglF, which shows more than eightfold greater activity towards b-1,3-1,4-lichenan rather than b-1,3-laminarin [4,11,13]. The results shown in Table 2 clearly indicate that the residues forming the kink represent the major structural determinants of pfLamA substrate preference, as the Dloop mutant hydrolyses b-1,3-1,4-lichenan 10-fold more efficiently than the wild-type does. Interestingly, the deletion of the four residues forming the kink does not affect pfLamA substrate preference only, but also its thermoactivity. The decreased activity at high temperature of the Dloop mutant may be a result of the absence of Tyr74 which, in the wild-type protein, contributes to the stabilization of the catalytic site through a hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 3B). The structurally aligned residues of pfLamA and BglF show 52% identity and a closely similar overall fold, making them suitable for comparison of mesophilic and hyperthermophilic phenotypes. pfLamA contains two additional secondary structural elements which may contribute to its higher stability with respect to the mesophilic phenotype. The presence of an additional b strand (b0) (Fig. 1B) at the N-terminus, which interacts with b15, and the presence of the six-residue kink (Figs 1B and 3A) may be invoked to contribute to the increased stability of the hyperthermophilic enzyme at high temperature. Interestingly, in pfLamA, the two charged amino acid substitutions E102 and R104, which connect the surface with the protein core in one of the two large ion pair networks, highlight the importance of the local contribution of b4 to the overall enzyme stability.

Looking at the protein surface, pfLamA displays 38 charged amino acid residues, eight more than BglF, most paired in ionic interactions, so that the number of ion pairs is doubled in comparison with that in the mesophilic enzyme (Fig. 1A). A peculiarity observed in the structure of pfLamA is that every large ionic network, which contributes to the stabilization energy more than the sum of the pairwise interactions [28,29], contains at least one charged residue buried in the protein core. The ionic interactions established by the charged buried residues contribute to protein stabilization despite the desolvation penalty [32,33], which, however, decreases at increasing temperature [34,35]. The architecture of the calcium binding sites of pfLamA and BglF is closely similar, although, in pfLamA, two of the three residues involved in metal binding are also involved in ionic interactions, whereas, in the mesophilic enzyme, only one of the three calcium binding residues, Glu14, interacts with a positively charged residue. The additional aromatic clusters observed in the pfLamA structure may be considered as structural determinants of thermostability, as reported for several thermophilic proteins [30,31]. In particular, the aromatic cluster located close to the active site, formed between the surface-exposed Tyr74 and the buried Tyr79 and Tyr87, may play an important role in pfLamA thermoactivity, as suggested by the decrease in thermoactivity of the Dloop variant, which lacks Tyr74.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the structural and functional studies presented here provide an insight into the structure­ function relationship of members of the family 16 endo-b-glucanases. The structural comparison between pfLamA and two proteins of the same family, BglF and H(A16-M), displaying a similar overall fold, but a different substrate preference towards the sugar polymers laminarin and lichenan, indicates that the main difference is represented by a short kink, six residues long, placed at the entrance of the catalytic cleft (residues 72­77). In the kink, the exposed Tyr74 is part of a hydrogen-bonding network which stabilizes the catalytic cleft and participates in a large aromatic interaction which involves residues buried in the core. Surprisingly, the kink plays an important role in pfLamA substrate recognition as well as thermoactivity. The hydrolytic activity of the Dloop mutant towards lichenan increases about tenfold relative to that of the wild-type at low temperature, but its thermoactivity decreases significantly. This finding indicates that the kink is important to stabilize the

conformation of the catalytic cleft, thereby increasing the efficiency of the enzyme at high temperature.

Materials and methods
Site-directed mutagenesis
The mutant form of pfLamA (Dloop) with the desired deletion was produced with the wild-type construct pET9d::LamA as template, using the Quik-ChangeÔ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). The kit employs double-stranded DNA as template, two complementary oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation and DpnI endonuclease to digest the parental DNA template. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). The two mutagenic primers were as follows: 5¢-GAGA AGGGAAATGGA(ATAGCTTATGGA)ATCCCGGGAT GGGGG-3¢ and 5¢-CCCCCATCCCGGGAT(TCCATAA GCTAT)TCCATTTCCCTTCTC-3¢. The wild-type nucleotide sequence, which was deleted in the pfLamA Dloop mutant, is marked in parentheses. Escherichia coli strain DH5a cells were transformed. The coding region of the mutated pfLamA gene was sequenced to confirm the deletion, and E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) cells were transformed and used for expression.

Data were collected as 1.0° oscillation frames using the MAR CCD detector on the XRD1 beamline at ELETTRA, ° Basovizza (Trieste, Italy) at a wavelength of 1.0 A. Data collection was performed at 100 K. Data analysis performed with denzo [38] indicates that the crystals are monoclinic (P21). Data were scaled using scalepack [38] ° and are 99.8% complete at 2.16 A resolution with an Rmerge value of 8.5% and a v2 value of 0.86. The crystal contains two monomers per asymmetric unit, with ° VM = 2.2 A3ÆDa)1 and a solvent content of 43% (Table 1).

Structure solution and refinement
The structure was determined by molecular replacement using a polyalanine-truncated model built from BglF (2HYK) as search probe. The rotational and translational searches, performed with molrep [39] in the resolution ° range 10­3.0 A, produced a clear solution corresponding to a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Refinement of the atomic coordinates and displacement parameters was carried out using Refmac5 [40]. The final Rfactor and Rfree values at ° 2.16 A resolution are 19.29% and 22.91%, respectively, ° with an rmsd of 0.008 A on the bond lengths and 1.349° on the bond angles. All the refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Model building was performed using the program package coot [41]. Water molecules were added to the model manually. The final model (a dimer) includes 525 residues (residues 34­297 for monomer A and residues 35­297 for monomer B), 262 water molecules, two calcium ions, three chloride ions, two sodium ions and four MPD molecules. The quality of the model was assessed using procheck [42]. The most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot contain 88.4% non-glycine residues. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in PDB under the accession code 2VY0.

Enzyme preparation and assay
Wild-type pfLamA and the Dloop variant were functionally produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells with pET9d:.LamA and E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells, respectively. Both proteins were purified according to Kaper et al. [36]. The conditions used for expression and purification of the mutant protein in E. coli were identical to those described for the wild-type enzyme. The protein concentration was determined at 280 nm using e280 = 83 070 m)1Æcm)1, calculated according to Gill and von Hippel [37]. The enzyme activity was determined by measuring the amount of reducing sugars released on incubation in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 5 mgÆmL)1 of laminarin or 5 mgÆmL)1 of lichenan, over a temperature range from 30 to 90 °C for 10 min, as described in Kaper et al. [36].
