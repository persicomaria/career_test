Protein L consists of a single -helix packed on a four-stranded -sheet formed by two symmetrically opposed -hairpins. We use a computer-based protein design procedure to stabilize a domainswapped dimer of protein L in which the second -turn straightens and the C-terminal strand inserts into the -sheet of the partner. The designed obligate dimer contains three mutations (A52V, N53P, and G55A) and has a dissociation constant of 700 pM, which is comparable to the dissociation constant of many naturally occurring protein dimers. The structure of the dimer has been determined by x-ray crystallography and is close to the in silico model.

3 kcal/mol (17, 18). In this instance we used the computational procedure to search for a low free energy sequence for the structure of the protein L dimer, and then evaluated this sequence in the context of the monomeric structure to find mutations that favor the dimer and disfavor the monomer. Here, we report the design, biophysical characterization, and structure determination of a designed obligate dimer of protein L (designated as VPA) that contains three mutations, A52V, N53P, and G55A. Materials and Methods
Design Protocol. A Monte Carlo optimization procedure was

n domain swapping, one structural element of a protein breaks its noncovalent bonds with the rest of the protein and reforms them with an identical partner (1, 2). The result is an intertwined dimer or a higher-order oligomer. All of the interactions that stabilize the monomer are present in the oligomer except for those in the hinge region that connects the swapped domain with the rest of its chain. Often the hinge region forms a loop or turn in the monomer, and just a few mutations to this region of the protein will induce formation of the domain-swapped oligomer. Several studies have shown that shortening the hinge region often stabilizes the domainswapped variant (3­7). In these cases it appears that the shorter loop prevents the chain from bending back and reinserting into the monomer, but the chain can easily continue forward into the partner of the domain-swapped structure. Another scenario involves leaving the loop length unchanged, but making amino acid substitutions that favor one hinge conformation over the other. The 62-residue IgG-binding domain of protein L is monomeric and consists of a single -helix packed on a fourstranded -sheet formed by two -hairpins (8, 9). We found, by chance, that when a single mutation (G55A) is made in the second hairpin of the protein, the mutant forms a domainswapped dimer at protein concentrations above 30 M (10). In the dimer, the second hairpin straightens out and the C-terminal -strand inserts into the partner. In wild-type protein L, the second hairpin forms an unusual four-residue turn that contains three consecutive residues with positive angles. Kinetic experiments show that this hairpin forms after the rate-limiting step in folding, perhaps because the strain in the turn can only be compensated by formation of nonlocal interactions with the rest of the protein (11). Mutating glycine-55 to alanine adds further strain to the turn because this position has a positive angle that is unfavorable for nonglycines. Despite this mutation, this variant of protein L is still a fairly stable monomer, 2.6 kcal/mol, at protein concentrations below 10 M (11). Recently we developed a computational procedure for protein design (12). Similar to other programs that have been developed (13­15), this program searches sequence space for amino acid rotamers that pack with low free energy. There have been impressive results with models of this sort. Highlights include the design of a coiled-coil (16) with a righthanded superhelical twist and proteins stabilized by more than

Stability Measurements. Guanidine (Gdn) denaturations at vari-

ous concentrations of protein L were used to measure the association constant for the dimer. Protein solutions were made in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), and the temperature was kept at 295 K. Denaturation was monitored by using the circular dichroism signal at 220 nm as described (19). The data were fit to an equilibrium of between unfolded monomer (U) and folded dimer (F). | 0 F 2 - 2U,

used to search for amino acid rotamers that pack with low free energy on a fixed-backbone template. The dominant terms in the energy function are a Lennard­Jones packing term, solvation energies derived from the Lazaridis­Karplus implicit solvation model, and backbone-dependent internal free energies of amino acid rotamers estimated from Protein Data Base statistics. The model and energy function have been described in more detail (12).

1.5418 plate at room temperature by using Cu K radiation ( Å) generated by a RIGAKU rotating-anode generator operating at 50 kW. The data collection statistics for the crystal are summarized in Table 2. The program XFIT (20) was used for manipulations of the molecular replacement solutions and model building. The program EPMR (21) was used for molecular replacement. The molecular replacement model was half of the G55A dimer

(the bases for the VPA model), which represents the asymmetric unit (10). Residues A52 and D53 were truncated to glycine in the G55A model. Ref lections between 3.5 and 15 Å were used and EPMR found one VPA molecule in the asymmetric unit. Between model building iterative cycles of positional, simulated annealing (2,500 K), and individual B-factor refinement, as well as automatic water picking, were carried out using Crystallography & NMR System (22). A simulated annealing composite omit 2Fobs Fcalc map was generated after each cycle of refinement to verify atomic positions and to aid model rebuilding. The stereochemical properties of all of the mutant structures were examined by PROCHECK (22). The environmental preference for each residue was assessed by the program VERIFY-3D (23) and the distribution of nonbonded atoms in the neighborhood of each atom was analyzed by ERRAT (24). There were no violations detected by either method.
Size-Exclusion Chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out using an analytical Superdex-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia). The WT, G55A, and VPA protein L samples were equilibrated at the loaded concentrations for 2 days at 4°C in 25 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0 200 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA, then loaded onto the Superdex-75 column at room temperature.

the VPA structure, and the C-terminal strand is swapped and integrated into the dimeric partner (Fig. 4). The main-chain rms deviation between the G55A dimer and VPA (residues 4 ­ 64) is small, 0.40 Å, indicating that the mutations A52V and N53P did not significantly perturb the structure. A comparison of the VPA structure with the model generated by the design procedure shows that V52 and P53 were modeled into the correct rotamers (Fig. 5). A series of guanidine denaturations at various concentrations of protein were used to probe the monomer­ dimer equilibrium of VPA. The three possible states during unfolding are folded dimer, folded monomer, and unfolded monomer. If the dimer dissociates at lower concentrations of denaturant than the monomer unfolds, only the equilibrium between folded monomer and unfolded monomer will be observed in the denaturation experiments. In this case, the reaction would be unimolecular and the unfolding curves would be independent of protein concentration. For the protein L dimer, we found that the unfolding curves are dependent on protein concentration and that the protein is more stable at high protein concentrations (Fig. 6). This indicates that dimer is

Results To select a sequence that would form a protein L obligate dimer, the energies of four different sequence structure combinations were evaluated computationally: (i) monomeric protein L with the wild-type sequence, (ii) the wild-type protein L sequence packed onto the backbone coordinates of the single-mutant strand-swapped dimer (G55A), (iii) a new sequence designed to be optimal for the dimeric version of protein L, and (iv) the new sequence packed on monomeric protein L (Table 1). To generate the new sequence, the backbone coordinates of the single-mutant strand-swapped dimer were used as a template (10), and our design procedure was used to redesign residues 51­58. These positions are in the second turn of protein L, and the amino acids at these positions take part in interactions in the dimer that do not occur in the monomer. All other side chains in the protein were fixed at the coordinates observed in the crystal structure. The four sets of energies were examined to determine which mutations most stabilize the dimer while destabilizing the monomer. Three mutations were identified that most fit this criteria, A52V, N53P, and G55A (Table 1). Therefore, a second round of design was performed in which the sequence was varied only at positions 52, 53, and 55. In this case, the same three mutations were observed (Fig. 1). Proline-53 is unfavorable in the monomer configuration because position 53 has a angle of 104°, and prolines can have angles only near 60°. In the strand-swapped structure, the angle at position 53 is 73°. Valine-52 is predicted to clash with other residues in the monomer configuration, whereas it takes part in only favorable interactions in the dimer. Position 55 has a positive angle in the monomer that makes alanine unfavorable in this position. The purified VPA protein was run on a size-exclusion chromatography column and found to be a dimer at protein concentrations of 15 M. In comparison, G55A is predominately monomeric at this concentration (Fig. 2). Next, we crystallized and solved the VPA structure to 1.9 Å (Table 2, Fig. 3). We found that, like the G55A structure, VPA crystallizes as a dimer with half of a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The residues that form the second -turn in wild-type protein L are in an extended configuration with negative values in

The measured values for G° are the u same within error for the different unfolding experiments: 12.5 kcal/mol (100 M protein), 12.0 kcal/mol (10 M), and 12.6 kcal/mol (2 M). This result suggests that folded monomer is not significantly populated, and that VPA is an obligate dimer. A G° of 12.5 kcal/mol corresponds to a dissociation constant u of 700 pM. Discussion The stability ( Go) of the obligate dimer, 12.5 kcal/mol, is greater than the stability of two wild-type protein L molecules,

The data were fit to a folded dimer­ unfolded monomer equilibrium (see Materials and Methods) to determine the stability of the dimer. The measured values for G° are the u same within error for the different unfolding experiments: 12.5 kcal/mol (100 M protein), 12.0 kcal/mol (10 M), and 12.6 kcal/mol (2 M).

2 4.6 kcal/mol. Most of the interactions in the two molecules are the same, so the differences in free energy must ref lect changes in translational entropy and differences in energies of the hinge residues. Losses in translational entropy will disfavor the dimer by 3­10 kcal/mol (25), and therefore the hinge residues probably have been stabilized by at least 2­3 kcal/mol per chain. A significant portion of this change may be a reduction in backbone strain, as D53 and K54 have positive angles in wild-type protein L, whereas these residues are in more favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot in the dimer. Also, Y56 makes more favorable contacts in the dimer, and its computed Lennard­Jones energy is nearly twice as low in the dimer. The Kd for the protein L obligate dimer, 700 pM, falls within the range observed for naturally occurring dimers, 10 4 to 10 15 (26). Because only three mutations were needed to create this strong interaction, it is evident how powerful and simple domain swapping is as a mechanism for creating oligomers. The success of the design illustrates the power of modern computational design methods in remodeling naturally occurring proteins.
