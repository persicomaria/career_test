Sequestered Water and Binding Energy are Coupled in Complexes of  Cro Repressor with Non-consensus Binding Sequences
Donald C. Rau
Laboratory of Physical and Structural Biology, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA We use the osmotic pressure dependence of dissociation rates and relative binding constants to infer differences in sequestered water among complexes of  Cro repressor with varied DNA recognition sequences. For over a 1000-fold change in association constant, the number of water molecules sequestered by non-cognate complexes varies linearly with binding free energy. One extra bound water molecule is coupled with the loss of  150 cal/mol complex in binding free energy. Equivalently, every tenfold decrease in binding constant at constant salt and temperature is associated with eight to nine additional water molecules sequestered in the non-cognate complex. The relative insensitivity of the difference in water molecules to the nature of the osmolyte used to probe the reaction suggests that the water is sterically sequestered. If the previously measured changes in heat capacity for  Cro binding to different non-cognate sequences are attributed solely to this change in water, then the heat capacity change per incorporated water is almost the same as the difference between ice and water. The associated changes in enthalpies and entropies, however, indicate that the change in complex structure involves more than a simple incorporation of fixed water molecules that act as adaptors between noncomplementary surfaces.

Introduction
It is now almost commonplace to find water molecules mediating interactions between sequencespecific DNA binding proteins and their recognition DNA sequences (see, e.g. Jayaram and Jain1). The specific trp repressor­operator complex is a classic example. Nearly all protein-DNA contacts are water-mediated.2 It is universally recognized that water plays an essential role in molecular recognition. A direct connection between sequestered water and binding energetics, however, has been difficult to show. A fundamental question is whether the numbers of water molecules sequestered by complexes of a protein with different DNA sequences are correlated to binding affinities? Heat capacity changes associated with protein-DNA binding have been considered to result at least partially from water

release.3,4 Large heat capacity differences have been observed between specific and non-specific binding of several protein-DNA complexes.5­8 The heat capacity changes associated with the binding of  Cro,6  cI,7 and lac8 repressors to non-cognate sequences are generally smaller than to the consensus recognition sequences, but larger than for nonspecific complexes, suggesting partial water release. One method for determining the numbers of water molecules sequestered by protein-DNA complexes is to measure the dependence of binding equilibrium and dissociation rate constants on water activity. Standard linkage relations describe the connection between changes in associated water and osmotic pressure. The osmotic stress approach has been widely used to measure changes in water associated with the binding of free protein and DNA to form complexes.9­23 We have been primarily interested in differences in sequestered water among specific, non-cognate, and non-specific complexes and have focused on competition binding reactions and dissociation rates.13,24­30 A linear dependence

353 examined here all have one consensus half site (GTGATA) and the same 5 bp spacer (ttgcg). For the OR3 site, the other half site is the TATCCC half site sequence of the naturally occurring OR3 operator. The OR1 site has the TACCTC half site sequence of the naturally occurring OR1 operator. The operators Op103 and Op105 have 1 and 3 bp changes from the consensus half site sequence, TGTCAC and TGTGAG, respectively. Two lengths of DNA fragments with each binding site were prepared, 360 and 235 bp for OC, OR1, Op103, and Op105 and 331 and 241 bp for OR3. Figure 1 shows a gel mobility shift assay for the pair-wise competition of binding sites: OC/OR3; OR3/OR1; OR1/Op103; and Op105/Op103. In all cases both combinations of 360 bp (331 bp for OR3) and 235 bp (241 bp for OR3) fragments were used. For example, the competing fragments are the 360 bp OC DNA and the 241 bp OR3DNA in lane 1 and the 235 bp OC DNA and the 331 bp OR3DNA in lane 2. The  Cro protein concentration was the same in all lanes; the salt concentration varied for the competing pairs to give a fraction of DNA in complex of  0.4 for the operator site with higher affinity. A stop reaction protocol30 was used to prevent perturbations to equilibrium prior to entering the gel. The protein-DNA complexes are stable once in the gel. The mobility shifts relative to free DNA for complexes with the strongest and weakest binding sites, OC and Op105, respectively, are virtually identical. No salt dependence of the relative equilibrium association constants for the OC/OR3 and Op103/ Op105 competitions was observed: KOC/KOR3 = 5.95 ± 0.2, 5.90 ± 0.15, and 5.95 ± 0.15 for 150, 180, and 260 mM KCl, respectively, and KOp103/KOp105 = 7.0 ± 0.2, 6.95 ± 0.15, and 6.95 ± 0.2 for 80, 100, and 140 mM KCl, respectively. The relative binding constant for

of relative binding free energies or dissociation rate constant activation energies on osmotic pressure indicates that the difference in the number of water molecules between the initial and final states is constant for that solute. Since exclusion of osmolytes from exposed surfaces generally depends on the nature of the macromolecular surface and solute identity,31­34 reactions that result in changes in the solute exposed surface area will show a solutedependent change in hydration. Little dependence on osmolyte nature is expected for differences in water molecules that are sterically sequestered in cavities, channels, or pockets. DNA-protein interactions show a broad spectrum of specificities. Many type II restriction endonucleases such as EcoRI represent one extreme. The change of a single base-pair from the consensus recognition sequence (e.g. a "star" sequence) is sufficient to weaken binding to energies nearly characteristic of completely non-specific complexes. The abrupt change in binding energy is accompanied by an abrupt change in the amount of water sequestered by these complexes. 29 EcoRI complexes with completely nonspecific DNA and with sequences differing by only 1 bp from the recognition sequence both sequester  110 more water molecules than the specific complex. The water sequestered by star sequence complexes but not by non-specific complexes, however, can be removed by moderate osmotic pressures.29 The binding specificity of the helix-turn-helix  Cro repressor is more typical of DNA-protein interactions. The crystal structure of a  Cro-consensus operator complex at 3 Å resolution shows an extensive hydrogen-bonding network between the protein and DNA surfaces.35 Unlike EcoRI, the binding energy decreases gradually as the consensus sequence is changed.36 This change in binding energy for  Cro repressor binding is accompanied by gradual changes in the entropy, enthalpy, and heat capacity of binding that are well correlated with the binding free energy.6 We investigate here the correlation between water sequestered by  Cro-DNA complexes and binding free energy. In order to avoid the complicating monomer-dimer equilibrium reaction of  Cro protein, we focus on the osmotic sensitivity of dissociation rates and relative binding constants of  Cro complexes with different sequences. We find that changes in binding free energy and water sequestered are linearly correlated. A complex with a non-cognate DNA sequence that binds  Cro repressor  4 kcal/ mol complex more weakly than the consensus sequence sequesters 25-30 more water molecules.

Results
Operator site binding The  Cro binding site consists of two 6 bp half sites separated by a 5 bp spacer. The OC operator consists of two consensus half sites, TATCACttgcgGTGATA. The other four non-cognate sequences

Figure 1. Relative binding of the operator sequences. The gel mobility shift assay was used to measure relative binding constants. The positions of the  Cro complex and free DNA bands for the two fragment lengths are indicated. The competing pairs of binding sites are shown at the bottom of the gel. The 360 bp DNA fragment (or 331 bp for OR3) of the more strongly binding operator site was used in lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7 and the 235 bp DNA fragment (or 241 bp for OR3) in lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8. The KCl concentration was 180 mM for the OC/OR3 competition; 155 mM for OR3/OR1; 115 mM for OR1/ Op103; and 100 mM for Op103/Op105. The reaction was allowed to equilibrate for 4 h at 20 °C.

354 the OR3/OR1 competition was 8.0 ± 0.2. This is consistent with the values of 6.7 36 and 10.337 reported for the naturally occurring OR3 and OR1 operators that also differ by 1 bp in the spacer region. The relative equilibrium association constants for the Op103/Op105 competition were the same to within 4% using either the 235 bp or the 360 bp Op105 DNA, indicating that non-specific binding was negligible even compared to  Cro binding to the weakest non-cognate site, Op105. Equilibrium association constants relative to the OC sequence, KOC/KOp, are given in Table 1. These relative binding constants were calculated by concatenating pair-wise association constants, for example, KOC/KOR1 = (KOC/KOR3) × (KOR3/KOR1). Operator site dissociation kinetics Dissociation kinetics are measured from the timedependent loss of initially formed complex of  Cro with DNA of one length and the appearance of complex on a second DNA fragment of different length but with the same binding site.27 Figure 2(a) shows a typical gel mobility shift for the dissociation of the  Cro-OC complex. With increasing time of reaction, there is loss of the initial 360 bp complex and formation of the 235 bp complex.  Cro protein is virtually stoichiometrically bound under the conditions of the experiment. Figure 2(b) shows that the dissociation of OC and Op105 complexes is well described by a simple first-order exponential decay. No DNA concentration dependence of the dissociation rate constant is observed over an approximate fourfold range of total site concentration. The salt concentration dependence of the dissociation rate constant is shown in Figure 2(c) for OC, OR1, and Op105. The slope corresponds to a net uptake of 7.4( ± 0.2) ions for all three operator complexes. It has been shown from the DNA length dependence of the association rate38 that  Cro repressor initially binds non-specifically then diffuses along DNA before either dissociating or encountering a specific binding site. In this case,

Ratios of equilibrium association constants, KOC/KOp, were determined as described in the text from the pair-wise competition results calculated using equation (1) and data as shown in Figure 1. The values are the result of averaging five experiments. b The salt dependence of the dissociation rate kd was calculated from the slopes of the lines seen in Figure 2(c). c Values of the dissociation rate constant for OC, OR1, and Op105 complexes, kd,Op, were calculated by extrapolating or interpolating the data shown in Figure 2(c) to 100 mM KCl and normalizing by kd of the OC complex also at 100 mM KCl.

Figure 2. (a) The gel mobility shift assay is used to measure dissociation rates.  Cro protein is initially to the 360 bp OC fragment and the 235 bp OC fragment then added and incubated in 170 mM KCl for the times (in min) indicated at the bottom of the gel. The reaction was quenched using a stop reaction mixture and then loaded on the gel. The positions of the 235 and 360 bp complexes are indicated. Dissociation is seen as the loss of the initially formed 360 bp complex and the gain of 235 bp complex. (b) The dissociation kinetics of  Cro complexes is simple exponential. The gel shown in (a) is analyzed using equation (2) to extract dissociation rates. The dissociation kinetics of the strongest binding sequence, OC (·), was measured at 170 mM KCl and of the weakest binding sequence examined, Op105 (), at 68 mM KCl. (c) The salt dependence of the dissociation rate is shown for the OC, OR1, and Op105 complexes. Dissociation rate constants were determined from the slopes of plots as shown in (b).

the dissociation rate is given by kd = knsp,d Knsp,sp,27 where knsp,d is the dissociation rate constant of a non-specific complex and Knsp,sp is the non-specificspecific relative binding constant. The ratio of

355 solute concentrations with all else held constant. Significantly less dissociation of the 360 bp complex or formation of the 235 bp complex is apparent as the osmolyte concentration increases. A marked difference between triethylene glycol and -methyl glucoside is also apparent. Figure 3(b) shows the dependence of ln(kd) for OC and Op105 complexes on osmotic pressure for the solutes triethylene glycol and glycine betaine. Equation (4) gives the relation between the slopes and Nw,d, the difference in the number of sequestered water molecules between the initial operator complex, Nw,Op, and the non-specific dissociation   transition state, Nw, i.e. Nw,d = Nw - Nw,Op. The linear dependence indicates that Nw,d is constant, insensitive to solute concentration. Nw,d, however, is strongly dependent on the nature of the osmolyte probing the reaction. There is a sixfold difference in Nw,d, for example, between glycine betaine and triethylene glycol for the Op105 complex. This is the expected behavior for reactions accompanied by large changes in solute exposed surface area. The exclusion of solutes from exposed surfaces is due to a more favorable interaction of the surface with water than with solute. The preferential interaction energy or, equivalently, the extent of solute exclusion depends both on the nature of the surface and the chemical nature and size of the solute.31­35,39­43 This is in contrast to the exclusion of solutes from water sequestered in cavities or pockets that does not depend on the solute identity.31,32 Figure 4(a) shows the dependence of Nw,d associated with complex dissociation for the solutes glycine betaine, -methyl glucoside, and triethylene glycol on the binding free energy of each operator relative to the OC site, RT ln(KOC/KOp) where RT, the thermal energy, is 0.6 kcal/ mol at 20 °C. In spite of the large difference in absolute numbers of water molecules for each solute, the parallel curves indicate that the relative changes among complexes are quite similar for each osmolyte. Figure 4(b) shows the number of water molecules coupled to dissociation for each operator complex relative to the OC complex, Nw,d = Nw,d(OC)­Nw,d(Op), as dependent on relative binding free energies. Since the contribution from viscosity is the same for the dissociation rate of all complexes, Nw,d has no contribution from solute-dependent viscosity changes. Since dissociation rates were measured at different salt concentrations for the different binding sites, this dependence of Nw,d on the binding site could reflect a salt concentration-dependent conformation either of the non-specific dissociation transition state or of the initial specific complex, i.e. that the numbers of water molecules sequestered by the  initial and final states, Nw,Op and Nw, are saltdependent. Such a salt concentration-dependent change in structure, however, would imply a salt sensitivity of relative equilibrium association constants or a non-constant salt sensitivity of dissociation rates. The salt concentration dependence of the dissociation rate, however, is the same within

dissociation rate constants extrapolated to a common salt concentration should then give relative binding constants. Table 1 shows binding constants relative to the OC site calculated from extrapolating dissociation rates to 100 mM KCl. Binding constants determined in this way are within 10% of those measured by direct competition equilibrium. Osmotic pressure dependence of the dissociation rate Figure 3(a) shows the effect of triethylene glycol and -methyl glucoside on dissociation kinetics. Dissociation of the  Cro-OC complex was allowed to proceed for 75 min in the presence of different

Figure 3. (a) Osmolytes slow the dissociation of  Cro complexes. The gel mobility shift assay was used to quantify the dissociation kinetics of  Cro-OC complexes in 165 mM KCl. As in Figure 2,  Cro repressor was initially added to the 360 bp fragment and the 235 bp fragment then added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 70 min then quenched and the mixture loaded on a gel. In lanes 1-5 the osmolyte is triethylene glycol and in lanes 6-10 -methyl glucoside. The concentration of each solute is increased from 0 to 1 osmolal in steps of 0.25 osmolal. (b) Dissociation rates vary exponentially with solute osmotic pressure. The dependence of ln(kd) on solute osmotic pressure is shown for  Cro-OC complexes ( , ) and for  Cro-Op105 complexes (·, ) with triethylene glycol ( , ) and glycine betaine ( , ·). The dissociation of OC complexes was measured in 165 mM KCl and of Op105 complexes in 70 mM KCl. The linear dependence of ln(kd) on osmotic pressure  indicates that the difference in the number of water molecules sequestered by the initial and final state is constant and independent of solute concentration. The slopes of the lines give Nw,d from equation (4).

Osmotic pressure sensitivity of competition binding We have also examined the osmotic sensitivity of relative equilibrium association constants for OC/ OR3 and Op103/Op105 by direct competition. The dependence of equilibrium binding on osmotic pressure cannot be measured as accurately as for dissociation rates. Figure 5(a) and (b) shows the dependence of ln(KOC/KOR3) and ln(KOp103/KOp105) on osmotic pressure, , for glycine betaine and triethylene glycol. For both sets of competition reactions the data for the two osmolytes overlap within experimental error. Averaging over both solutes gives Nw,OC/OR3 = 6.0( ± 1.2) and Nw,Op103/Op105 = 6.2( ± 1.7) water molecules. These numbers compare reasonably well with differences in sequestered water molecules extracted from dissociation kinetics, 6.7 and 7.3 water molecules for OC-OR3 and Op103­Op105, respectively.

Discussion
The role of water in recognition reactions has been considered from several perspectives and a strong correlation between water sequestered by nonFigure 4. (a) The change in the number of water molecules linked to dissociation depends on the operator. Nw,d measured from the slopes of plots as seen in Figure 3(b) for each solute and operator complex is shown as a function of the  Cro-operator binding free energy relative to the OC sequence: glycine betaine (·), -methyl glucoside ( ), and triethylene glycol (). (b) The difference in the number of sequestered water molecules for each operator complex relative to the OC complex, Nw,d ( = Nw,d(OC)­Nw,d(Op)) is shown as dependent on the relative binding free energy for all three solutes. The symbols are the same as in (a).



experimental error for the different operator sites (Figure 2(c)). Additionally, relative binding constants determined from direct equilibrium competition for OC/OR3 and Op103/Op105 show no salt concentration dependence. Lastly, relative binding constants calculated from dissociation rates extrapolated to a common salt concentration agree with those directly measured. We, therefore, conclude that the water sequestered by the non-specific dissociation transition state or the initial complex is not salt concentration-dependent over the range of  concentrations examined. Since Nw,d = Nw - Nw,Op, the relative number of water molecules, Nw,d, seen in Figure 4(b) then corresponds to the difference in the number of water molecules sequestered by the initial operator complexes, i.e. Nw,Op­Nw,OC. These relative numbers of water molecules are much less dependent on osmolyte nature than Nw,d seen Figure 4(a). This would suggest that the water molecules contributing to Nw,d are sterically sequestered from the solutes in cavities or pockets of the non-cognate complexes.

Figure 5. The osmotic sensitivities of relative association constants show a similar difference in the number of sequestered water molecules. The relative association constants for the OC/OR3 operator competition in 340 mM KCl (a) and for the Op103/Op105 competition in 150 mM KCl (b) are shown as dependent on solute osmotic pressure for triethylene glycol ( ) and glycine betaine (·).

357 interactions. The non-cognate complex structure has 13 total water molecules mediating protein­DNA contacts. The increase of 12 water molecules sequestered by the non-cognate complex compared with the cognate GR dbd­GRE complex and of six water molecules compared with the cognate ER dbd­ERE complex corresponds to at least tenfold lower association constants.54 Heat capacity changes associated with DNA- protein complex formation have been interpreted as due both to changes in protein folding or flexibility and to the release of hydration water molecules.3,4 In general, the formation of nonspecific complexes is characterized by small Cp values, particularly compared with specific complexes,4­8 consistent with the observed difference in hydration. Additionally, Cp values correlate quite well with binding free energies of  Cro repressor to non-cognate sequences.6 The correlation is not as strong for the binding of lac repressor to noncognate sequences,8 but in general Cp decreases as binding weakens, consistent with the release of fewer water molecules in forming non-cognate complexes. Here, we have found a strong connection between the number of water molecules sequestered by non-cognate complexes and binding free energy. In measuring sequestered water for noncognate  Cro-DNA complexes here we have focused on the osmotic sensitivity of dissociation rates since the monomer-dimer association reaction of free  Cro protein complicates the thermodynamics and restricts the experiments that can be straightforwardly interpreted. Jana et al.55 have reported a dissociation constant of  7 M in 200 mM KCl at 25 °C. Darling et al.56 report a Kd for the monomer-dimer equilibrium of  0.3 M under slightly different conditions. The dimerization reaction strongly affects both the DNA binding equilibrium and kinetics.55,57­59 Osmolytes will likely affect this reaction strongly. The monomer-dimer equilibrium, however, will not affect the osmotic dependence of dissociation rates;  Cro dimers are already assembled on the DNA and binding is virtually stoichiometric. A directly measured relative binding constant is also not dependent on the monomer-dimer equilibrium, but is practically limited to competing sites with Krel < 10 in order to accurately measure a ratio of protein-bound and free DNA fragments. The solute concentration dependence of the dissociation rate kd includes contributions from solute viscosity and from the difference in the number of water molecules, Nw,d, between the non-specific dissociation transition state and the operator complex. The linear dependence of ln(kd) on osmotic pressure (Figure 3(b)) indicates that Nw,d is constant for each solute. The strong dependence of Nw,d on solute nature for any particular complex (Figures 3(a) and 4(a)) indicates that dissociation results in a large change in solute exposed surface area. Significantly, Nw,d is also dependent on the DNA binding sequence.

cognate  Cro-DNA complexes and binding free energy might be reasonably anticipated. Direct force measurements on condensed arrays of several kinds of biomacromolecules, such as DNA, lipid bilayers, and several polysaccharides,44­47 and on the exclusion of small solutes from macromolecular surfaces33,34 have indicated that close interactions between molecules are dominated by the energetics of water structuring in confined spaces. Polar surfaces avidly hold on to water in the absence of a complementary surface that can replace favorable hydration interactions. Indeed, Woda et al. 48 reported a good correlation between the positions of water molecules that hydrate free DNA and of protein residues that hydrogen bond to DNA in specific complexes. A similar conclusion was also reached by Fuxreiter et al.49 who use the term "hydration fingerprint". Large differences in hydration are seen between several specific and non-specific DNA-protein complexes. The crystal structure of a non-specific complex of the restriction endonuclease BamHI shows a cavity between the DNA and protein surfaces that could accommodate  150 water molecules.50 This cavity is replaced in the specific complex by direct protein-DNA contacts. 51 A similar difference of 110 water molecules was inferred between specific and non-specific complexes of a structurally related restriction endonuclease EcoRI from the osmotic pressure sensitivity of the relative binding constant24,27 and dissociation rates.26,27 It was concluded that the water was sterically sequestered as with BamHI since Nw is insensitive to the solute identity. A similar difference of  140 water molecules between specific and nonspecific complexes of the gal repressor was previously reported 13 using osmotic stress. Additionally, the difference between the recognition consensus sequence and an operator sequence that bound gal repressor with only about half the affinity was estimated as  6( ± 3) water molecules. The NMR structure of a non-specific lac repressor complex shows that several of the protein residues that make contacts with bases in the specific complex interact with the phosphate groups on the DNA backbone.52 The result is a cavity at the protein­DNA interface that can accommodate water. The structures of many specific complexes show water molecules at the DNA-protein interface mediating protein-base and protein-DNA backbone interactions. Of particular pertinence, Gewirth and Sigler53 have compared the crystal structures of cognate complexes of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA binding domain (dbd) and a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) and of the estrogen receptor (ER) dbd and its estrogen response element (ERE) and a non-cognate complex of an estrogen receptor-like dbd with a GRE. The cognate GR dbd­ GRE complex structure shows one fixed water molecule mediating a protein­DNA contact. In the ER dbd­ERE complex structure, seven total water molecules are observed mediating protein­DNA

358 Complexes with smaller equilibrium association constants have fewer water molecules coupled to dissociation. This indicates that complexes of DNA sequences that bind  Cro more weakly sequester more water molecules. The comparative insensitivity of Nw,d to solute nature (Figure 4(b)) would suggest that these water molecules are sterically sequestered. The osmotic stress dependences of the direct competition reaction between OC and OR3 and between Op103 and Op105 (Figure 5) are consistent with the difference in water molecules extracted from dissociation rates. The striking feature of Figure 4(b) is that the number of extra water molecules incorporated varies approximately linearly with the loss of binding free energy. Every extra water molecule that the complex binds to accommodate a noncognate sequence is coupled to a decrease in the binding free energy of  150 cal/mol complex. This linearity extends over a change of 4 kcal/ mol complex in binding free energy. Takeda et al.6 have observed an equally striking linear dependence of the heat capacity change, Cp, on free energy over a range of 6 kcal/ mol complex for  Cro binding to different DNA sequences. If the entire change in Cp is attributed to the extra water molecules, then Cp = 8 cal/mol complex deg. K/mol extra water sequestered. The heat capacity difference between liquid water and ice is  9 cal/mol water deg. K. Water in ice is in a strong and extended hydrogen bonded network, but has greatly restricted translational and rotational freedom compared with liquid water. A close correspondence between Cp for  Cro binding and the Cp for the ice-water transition might be expected if water was incorporated into non-cognate complexes to act as adaptors between non-complementary surfaces. The enthalpy and entropy of the ice-water transition at 20 °C, however, are quite large and contribute oppositely to a small free energy change. This is quite unlike the results of Takeda et al.,6 which indicate that smaller  Cro repressor binding free energies are about equally distributed between unfavorable enthalpies and entropies. It is possible that the extra water molecules sequestered by non-cognate complexes can only make distorted hydrogen bonds to accommodate non-complementary protein and DNA surfaces or make fewer hydrogen bonds compared with bulk water while still losing configurational freedom, but not to the extent of ice. It is also possible that weaker binding is accompanied by changes either in the specific set of amino acid­base-pair interactions or in protein structure or flexibility as has been suggested for the lac repressor.52 Ohlendorf et al. 60 have noted the potential plasticity and flexibility of the  Cro protein that may enable this smooth change in structure. This adaptive change in the structure of the complex from specific to non-specific binding modes, however, would have to alter smoothly the proximity of DNA-protein interactions to account for the linear dependence of sequestered water and binding free energy.

Sequestered Water in  Cro­DNA Complexes

Alternatively,  Cro non-cognate complexes may be ensembles of a few discrete structures, rather than a continuous range of gradually changing conformations. Within an extreme two-state model, non-cognate complexes would be characterized by an equilibrium between a specific-like binding mode and a hydrated non-specific binding mode, as we suggested previously for the binding of EcoRI to star sequences. 29 The thermodynamic properties observed would be averages over the probabilities of the various conformations. An attractive feature of the two-state model is that a linear correlation between differences in sequestered water and differences in binding free energy is an immediate consequence if the specific-like mode has little water at the protein-DNA interface.

Methods and Materials
Materials The highest grade quality of the osmolytes glycine betaine, -methyl glucoside, and triethylene glycol were purchased from Fluka Chem. Co. and used without further purification. These solutes represent a convenient range of polarities, from zwitterionic glycine betaine to the comparatively non-polar triethylene glycol. Osmotic pressures of osmolyte solutions were measured using a Wescor 5520 Vapor Pressure Osmometer. The  Cro repressor protein was a kind gift from Dr Y. Takeda. Its isolation and storage has been described.61 Concentrated protein ( 1 mg/ml) stored at -80 °C was diluted 20-fold into 50% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mM Na phosphate (pH 7.2), 200 mM KCl, 0.1 mM NaEDTA and stored at -20 °C. This stock solution was used for binding and dissociation experiments. At least 95% of the protein was active as judged by DNA binding under stoichiometric conditions. The oligonucleotides used in constructing the DNA fragments containing  Cro operator sites were purchased from Gibco-BRL Life Technologies. Equimolar ratios of complementary strands were mixed in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, annealed and isolated using standard methods. The oligonucleotide CTTTATCACCGCAAGGGATAAACC (OR3) and its complement with appropriate single-stranded overhangs were ligated into BamHI/PstI digested pUC19. Similarly, the oligonucleotides (and appropriate complements) GCTATCACTTGCGGTGATAAA (OC), GCTACCTCTTGCGGTGATAAA (OR1), GCTGTCACTTGCGGTGATAAA (Op103), and GCTGTGAGTTGCGGTGATAAA (Op105) were ligated into AvaI/BamHI digested pNEB193 (a pUC19 derivative from New England Biolabs). DH5 Escherichia coli cells were transformed and grown using standard protocols. Plasmids were isolated using a Qiagen Plasmid Mega Kit. Two lengths of DNA fragments containing  Cro recognition sites were prepared by digesting plasmids either with PvuII or with BglI/HindIII. Fragments were isolated from agarose gels and amplified by PCR. The PvuII fragments were 360 bp for the OC, OR1, Op103, and Op105 operators and 331 bp for OR3. The lengths of the BglI/HindIII fragments were 235 bp for the OC, OR1, Op103, and Op105 operators and 241 bp for OR3.

Sequestered Water in  Cro­DNA Complexes The oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding sequence, GGCCGCTATCACTTGCGGTGATACCGCC and its complement, were purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies, annealed, and purified. This OC oligonucleotide was used to bind free protein in the stop reaction mixture. DNA binding equilibrium and dissociation kinetics DNA binding reactions contained 20 mM imidazole-Cl (pH 7.2), 1 mM NaEDTA, and 100 g/ml acetylated BSA, in addition to varying concentrations of KCl and osmolyte. All competition equilibrium and dissociation rate experiments were performed at 20 °C. The standard reaction volume was 30 l. For equilibrium competition binding,  Cro protein was added to a mixture of two DNA fragments of different lengths and with different  Cro binding sites. Typically the DNA concentration for each fragment was  2 nM in sites.  Cro protein concentrations were adjusted to give a fraction DNA bound for the stronger operator of 0.4­0.5 and varied between 1 and 10 nM depending on KCl and osmolyte concentrations. Samples were incubated for  3 h, five fold longer than the slowest dissociation half-life time. Dissociation rates were measured using the same approach as described by Sidorova and Rau.27  Cro repressor was added to DNA fragment of one length (typically the 360 bp fragment), incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. The other length DNA fragment was then added and the reaction mixture incubated at 20 °C for varying times. Both DNA fragments contained the same  Cro binding site. Usually the binding site concentration of each fragment was  2 nM in sites and the  Cro repressor concentration was 1 nM. The DNA and  Cro protein concentrations, however, were varied over a fourfold range to confirm that the dissociation rate was independent of DNA concentration. At the end of incubation for both equilibrium and kinetics experiments, the 30 l samples were mixed with 10 l of stop reaction mixture30 containing 4 M consensus sequence oligonucleotide, 84% (w/w) triethylene glycol, 10 mM KCl, and 10 mM imidazole-Cl (pH 7.2). The lowered salt and high osmolyte concentration greatly slows the dissociation of already formed complexes. The consensus sequence oligonucleotide is in  1000-fold excess over  Cro binding sites in the binding reaction and essentially traps free protein, preventing rebinding to DNA fragment. Gel electrophoresis  Cro protein binding was quantified using the gel mobility shift assay. Reaction mixtures with added stop reaction were loaded on 12% polyacrylamide gels and run for 15 h at 150 V in TAE buffer (25 mM Tris, 12.5 mM acetic acid, 0.6 mM NaEDTA). The gels were then stained with SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) and imaged with either a FujiFilm LAS-1000plus CCD camera or FLA-3000 laser scanner. The integrated intensities of free and proteinbound DNA fluorescent bands were determined using FujiFilm MultiGauge software. No indication of complex dissociation during electrophoresis was observed. Relative binding constants and dissociation rates can be directly determined from integrated intensities. If fb,Op1 and fb,Op2 are the fraction of the total integrated intensity for each DNA fragment in the protein-bound band for the competing Op1 and Op2 sites, respectively, and if KOp1

359
and KOp2 are the equilibrium association constants for the two sites, then: Krel ¼ KOp1 fb;Op1 ð1 À fb;Op2 Þ : ¼ KOp2 fb;Op2 ð1 À fb;Op1 Þ ð1Þ

For dissociation kinetics, initially formed 360 bp complex dissociates and redistributes between the 360 and the added 235 bp DNA fragments. If the fraction of DNA in complex is fb,360 and fb,235 for the 360 and 235 bp fragments, respectively, then:27 FðtÞ ¼ fb;360 ðtÞ À fb;235 ðtÞ ; fb;360 ðtÞ þ fb;235 ðtÞðItot;235 =Itot;360 Þð360=235Þ ð2Þ

where I tot,235 and I tot,360 are the total integrated intensities for the 235 and 360 bp fragments, respecd tively. For simple dissociation kinetics, F(t) = e-k t, where kd = kd/(1-fb()), kd is the elementary dissociation rate,  and fb() the fraction bound at equilibrium. The denominator of equation (2) is a measure of the total bound protein, P0. No change in the total protein was observed with 4 h incubation at 20 °C. For osmotic pressures expressed as osmolal concentrations, the number of water molecules linked to relative binding constants or dissociation rates is: dlnðKrel Þ DNw;rel ¼À d½osmolal 55:6 and DNw;d dlnðkd Þ ¼À : d½osmolal 55:6 ð4Þ ð3Þ

If the dissociation rate is dependent on viscosity, then part of Nw,d is due to changes in viscosity with added solute. This effect corresponds to the equivalent of ten water molecules for glycine betaine, of 25 water molecules for -methyl glucoside, and of 20 water molecules for triethylene glycol.27
