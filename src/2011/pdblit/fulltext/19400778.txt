Introduction
Staphylococcus aureus colonizes human mucosal and epidermal surfaces (Eriksen et al., 1995), and is a frequent opportunistic pathogen of surgical wounds (Herwaldt, 2003) and implanted medical devices (Heimberger and Duma, 1989; Coles, 1995; Sitges-Serra and Girvent, 1999). S. aureus expresses a myriad of virulence factors, including adhesins, proteases, lysins and superantigens (Dinges et al., 2000; Dubin, 2002; Foster, 2005; Clarke and Foster, 2006). Systemic dissemination through blood and soft tissues is characterized by rapid bacterial proliferation and tissue destruction, manifesting in syndromes including septicaemia, endocarditis and necrotizing pneumonia (Moreillon et al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2005; Garnier et al., 2006). With few exceptions (Archibald, 1983; Posey and Gherardini, 2000), iron is an essential nutrient for all microbes. Under physiological conditions, free iron persists predominantly in insoluble ferric (Fe3+) hydroxides (Greenwood and Earnshaw, 1997). Owing to its low solubility and stringent sequestration in mammalian tissues and fluids, the free iron concentration in human tissues is estimated to be around 10-18 M (Bullen et al., 1978), well below the threshold required to sustain microbial life, making iron acquisition a major challenge for microorganisms. Numerous bacteria, fungi and plants overcome iron limitation by secreting siderophores which are lowmolecular-weight, high-affinity ferric chelators synthesized by specialized enzymes. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) represent the best-characterized class of siderophore synthetic machinery and are responsible for the synthesis of enterobactin and vibriobactin, among others (for a review, see Crosa and Walsh, 2002). NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) systems are utilized for the condensation of dicarboxylic acids with diamine or amino alcohol substrates, linked by amide or ester bonds, to build siderophores such as aerobactin (for a recent review, see Challis, 2005). Staphylococcus aureus, along with several coagulasenegative staphylococcal species, has been shown to secrete two polycarboxylate-type siderophores whose structures have been determined ­ staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B (Konetschny-Rapp et al., 1990; Meiwes et al., 1990; Drechsel et al., 1993; Haag et al., 1994).

Summary
Iron is critical for virtually all forms of life. The production of high-affinity iron chelators, siderophores, and the subsequent uptake of iron­siderophore complexes are a common strategy employed by microorganisms to acquire iron. Staphylococcus aureus produces siderophores but genetic information underlying their synthesis and transport is limited. Previous work implicated the sbn operon in siderophore synthesis and the sirABC operon in uptake. Here we characterize a second siderophore biosynthetic locus in S. aureus; the locus consists of four genes (in strain Newman these open reading frames are designated NWMN_2079­2082) which, together, are responsible for the synthesis and export of staphyloferrin A, a polycarboxylate siderophore. While deletion of the NWMN_2079­2082 locus did not affect iron-restricted growth of S. aureus, strains bearing combined sbn and NWMN_2079­2082 locus deletions produced no detectable siderophore and demonstrated severely attenuated iron-restricted growth. Adjacent to NWMN_2079­2082 resides the htsABC operon, encoding an ABC transporter previously implicated in haem acquisition. We provide evidence here that HtsABC, along with the FhuC ATPase, is required for the uptake of staphyloferrin A. The crystal structure of apo-HtsA was determined and identified a large positively charged region in the substrate-binding pocket, in agreement with a role in binding of anionic staphyloferrin A.

However, information on the genetic loci responsible for production and transport of these siderophores has been limited. In S. aureus, the divergently transcribed operons sbnABCDEFGHI and sirABC encode proteins necessary for synthesis and transport of a siderophore (Dale et al., 2004a,b). Unfortunately, the structural identity of the siderophore produced by Sbn enzymes was unconfirmed at the time (the siderophore was tentatively called staphylobactin). However, work by Bhatt and Denny (2004) showed that a homologous gene cluster in Ralstonia spp. is linked to the synthesis of staphyloferrin B, lending significant support to the idea that the sbn operon is responsible for staphyloferrin B synthesis in S. aureus. The S. aureus genome encodes at least six known and predicted ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for iron or haem acquisition. Haem acquisition is mediated by the recently studied iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system (Mazmanian et al., 2003; Skaar and Schneewind, 2004; Skaar et al., 2004a; Maresso and Schneewind, 2006; Torres et al., 2006; Vermeiren et al., 2006; Grigg et al., 2007; Pluym et al., 2007; Reniere et al., 2007; Sharp et al., 2007; Muryoi et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2008), while two iron­siderophore uptake systems (Sir and Fhu) have been characterized in some detail (Sebulsky et al., 2000; 2003; 2004; Sebulsky and Heinrichs, 2001; Dale et al., 2004b; Speziali et al., 2006). In this study, we report the characterization of an ironregulated, four-gene locus (NWMN_2079­2082) and confirm its role in the synthesis of staphyloferrin A by S. aureus strains Newman and RN6390. We show that deletion of this locus from the genome yields no detectable iron-restricted growth defect, unless introduced into a strain bearing an sbn deletion. Indeed, strains containing deletions of both loci grew poorly in serum and produced no detectable siderophore. We further demonstrate that uptake of staphyloferrin A is mediated by the Hts ABC transporter in conjunction with the FhuC ATPase. The apo-HtsA crystal structure identified a highly charged binding pocket that would be suited to interact with the anionic staphyloferrin A molecule.

of sbnE in S. aureus leads to poor growth in iron-depleted media in comparison with wild type and culture supernatants of an sbnE mutant failed to promote S. aureus growth in siderophore plate bioassays (Dale et al., 2004a). Since that study, the use of different growth and bioassay conditions that were less stringently iron-chelated were tested and showed that sbnE mutants do, in fact, produce a siderophore capable of promoting S. aureus iron-limited growth (data not shown), especially if the bacteria are grown for periods longer than 24 h in iron-chelated media. To deduce whether siderophore production observed in sbnE mutants arose from the activity of the remaining Sbn proteins, or whether it arose from an entirely different siderophore biosynthetic pathway leading to production of a distinct second molecule, strains containing complete sbn operon deletions (i.e. deleted for all of the sbnA through sbnI genes) were constructed. When cultured in serum at 37°C, H1331 (Newman Dsbn), in comparison with its parent strain Newman, demonstrated markedly impaired growth during the first 15 h of incubation, before eventually growing to an equivalent cell density by approximately 30 h (Fig. 1). Supplementation of serum growth media with iron obviated the growth defect of H1331 (Fig. 1, inset). Finally, siderophore plate bioassays determined that concentrated, iron-chelated spent culture supernatant from both S. aureus Newman and H1331 promotes growth of S. aureus (two strains were used in this assay, Newman and RN6390, and they responded equivalently) (Table 1). To ensure that these results were not specific to strain Newman, all experiments described above were repeated using RN6390 and its isogenic sbn deletion mutant, H1324, and equivalent results were obtained (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that S. aureus strains RN6390 and Newman syn-

Results
S. aureus sbn mutants still produce siderophore The role of products expressed from the S. aureus sbn operon, and specifically the sbnE gene which encodes a NIS synthetase, in synthesizing an S. aureus siderophore has been established (Dale et al., 2004a). Although not yet confirmed in S. aureus, the sbn operon likely encodes enzymes responsible for the synthesis of staphyloferrin B based on work in Ralstonia demonstrating that mutations in a homologous operon lead to loss of staphyloferrin B in culture supernatants (Bhatt and Denny, 2004).

thesize at least two siderophores, one of which does not require products of the sbn operon for synthesis. Characterization of a second iron-regulated, siderophore biosynthetic locus in S. aureus Since S. aureus sbn deletion mutants still produced siderophore, we sought to identify other genetic loci in S. aureus whose products would be capable of synthesizing a siderophore. Examination of the available S. aureus genome sequences identified a four-gene locus with potential to encode siderophore biosynthetic enzymes; in strain Newman, these open reading frames are identified as NWMN_2079­2082 (Fig. 2). The locus resides on the

genome immediately adjacent to the htsABC operon (NWMN_2078­2076), encoding components of an ABC transporter that has been proposed to transport haem into the staphylococcal cell (Skaar et al., 2004b). The NWMN_2082 open reading frame is divergently oriented from what is likely a polycistronic message comprised of NWMN_2081­2079. Two of the predicted polypeptides, NWMN_2082 and NWMN_2080, share sequence similarity with known (e.g. IucA and IucC in Escherichia coli ) or predicted NIS synthetases in other bacteria, and the SbnC, SbnE and SbnF NIS synthetases from S. aureus (see Table 2). The predicted NWMN_2081 protein shares similarity with membrane transport proteins while NWMN_2079 shares similarity with amino acid racemases in a variety of bacteria. The intergenic region between divergently oriented NWMN_2082 and NWMN_2081 open reading frames and the region immediately upstream of the htsABC operon each contain 19 bp sequences that are highly similar to consensus Fur box sequences (Lee and Helmann, 2007), suggesting that the NWMN_2082, NWMN_2081 and hts transcripts are iron-regulated via the activity of the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) repressor protein. Consistent with this prediction, both the NWNM_2082 and NWMN_2081 transcripts were upregulated in an iron- and Furdependent manner (Fig. 3). The htsABC operon was similarly regulated (Fig. 3), and Western immunoblotting for HtsA expression during growth in serum (Fig. 3, inset) corroborated the htsA transcriptional data. Deletion of the NWMN_2082­2079 locus in wild-type S. aureus backgrounds yields no growth-deficient phenotype As described above, the NWMN_2082­2079 genes are expressed under conditions of iron limitation, and two of

growth media were replete with iron (Fig. 4, inset), indicating that the growth deficiency is due solely to the inability to scavenge available iron. Of note, concentrated culture supernatant from iron-restricted H1666 failed to promote the iron-starved growth of wild-type S. aureus under the conditions of the assay (Table 1). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that total siderophore production by S. aureus is mediated by the sbn and NWMN_2082­2079 loci. The NWMN_2082­2079 locus mediates staphyloferrin A biosynthesis

the genes (NWMN_2082 and NWMN_2080) encode products with similarity to NIS synthetases. We therefore hypothesized that deletion of the locus would lead to a drop in siderophore production, and consequently this would result in a strain deficient in its ability to grow in iron-chelated culture media (e.g. serum), mimicking what is observed for strains harbouring sbn operon deletions (see Fig. 1). To address this hypothesis, strain H1665 (Newman DNWMN_2082­2079) was created. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the phenotype observed for strain H1331 (sbn locus deletion), H1665 displayed no discernible growth attenuation in serum (Fig. 4). Concentrated culture supernatant from H1665 readily promoted the growth of iron-starved wild-type S. aureus strains (Table 1), indicating the presence of at least one siderophore molecule (likely encoded by products of at least the sbn genes). S. aureus harbouring deletions in both sbn and NWMN_2082­2079 loci are severely growth attenuated in iron-deplete media To address whether Sbn-mediated siderophore activity was able to compensate for the loss of NWMN_2082­ 2079-mediated siderophore activity, sbn and NWMN_ 2082­2079 locus deletions were combined into one strain, H1666. Compared with either strain H1331 (Dsbn) or H1665 (DNWMN_2082­2079), strain H1666 (Dsbn DNWMN_2082­2079) demonstrated severe attenuation of growth in serum (Fig. 4). Growth of H1666 could, however, be resuscitated to wild-type levels if the

Given the predicted activities of the NWNM_ 2082­2079 locus (see Table 1 and above), it was reasonable to hypothesize that the locus was responsible for the synthesis of staphyloferrin A, a molecule comprised of D-ornithine condensed with two molecules of citric acid; synthesis of staphyloferrin A likely requires two NIS synthetases and an amino acid racemase. To demonstrate that the NWMN_2082­2079 locus was responsible for staphyloferrin A synthesis in S. aureus Newman and RN6390, spent culture supernatants from iron-restricted Dsbn and Dsbn DNWMN_2082­2079 were analysed for the siderophore (see Experimental procedures). Shown in Fig. 5 are the selected ion chromatograms and mass spectra for staphyloferrin A (479.11 m/z). Whereas a peak for m/z 479.11 eluted at 11.27 min from the S. aureus Dsbn sample (Fig. 5A), no peak above background was detected from S. aureus Dsbn DNWMN_2082­2079 (Fig. 5C). Associated spectra (Fig. 5B and D) clearly show a peak at 479.110 m/z

from the Dsbn sample (Fig. 5B), but not from the Dsbn DNWMN_2082­2079 sample (Fig. 5D). The small pea k at 12.45 min in Fig. 5C for the Dsbn DNWMN_2082­ 2079 sample did not give a peak at 479.110 m/z, but yielded a peak at 479.220 m/z. With the measured mass error of 0.005 Da, it can be concluded that the peak at 479.220 is not staphyloferrin A but an unknown. To further confirm that the peak detected at 479.110 m/z in Dsbn sample was staphyloferrin A, LC-MS/MS with CID (collision-induced dissociation) was carried out and the CID spectrum of the ion at 479.110 is shown in Fig. 5E. Most of the fragment peaks are generated through neutral loss of water and carbon dioxide. This kind of neutral loss, also observed in the CID spectrum of the citric acid anion (data not shown), fits well with the chemical structure of staphyloferrin A (Fig. 5E, inset). Together, the fragmentation pattern of the 479.110 ion, the mass accuracy of 10 p.p.m., and the fact that the molecule bound to metal ions in the LC-MS system without added EDTA (see Experimental procedures), provide solid evidence for the presence of staphyloferrin A in the S. aureus Dsbn supernatant and not in the Dsbn DNWMN_2082­2079 supernatant. We named the NWMN_2082­2079 gene cluster sfaA­D (sfa for staphyloferrin A). Importantly, a study published during the revision stage of this article demonstrated that the recombinant gene cluster from strain RN4220, named sfnaA­D and corresponding to NWMN_2082­2079, confers staphyloferrin A production on E. coli, and purified recombinant NWNM_2082 (SfnaD) and NWMN_2080 (SfnaB) enzymes (i.e. the two NIS synthetases) generate staphyloferrin A in vitro in the presence of D-ornithine, citric acid and ATP (Cotton et al., 2009). To conform to the three-letter convention for the naming of microbial genes, we will use the sfa nomenclature throughout the remainder of this article. HtsABC is the ABC transporter for staphyloferrin A Given the proximity of the htsABC operon to the sfaABCD locus (see Fig. 2), we hypothesized that HtsABC was responsible for transport of staphyloferrin A, despite the previous suggestion that HtsABC was involved in haem transport (Skaar et al., 2004b). To address this hypothesis, strains harbouring deletions of the htsABC operon were constructed and characterized. Similar to the lack of a growth defect in serum for H1665 (Newman Dsfa), we were unable to identify any growth defect in serum for the htsABC deletion strain, H1262 (Fig. 6), while the growth kinetics of H803 (Newman sirA::Km) were very similar to those observed for H1331 (Newman Dsbn) (Fig. 6). Moreover, similar to the results obtained for Dsbn Dsfa mutants, inactivation of sirA and htsABC in the same strain (H1497) leads to drastic growth attenuation in serum (Fig. 6).

Two separate assays were used to directly demonstrate the involvement of HtsABC in transport of staphyloferrin A derived from the function of sfa gene products: siderophore plate bioassay and radioactive iron uptake assays. For siderophore plate bioassays, spent culture supernatants from each of H1331, H1665 and H1666 grown under iron-starvation conditions were concentrated and provided to wild type, sirA::Km, DhtsABC and sirA::Km DhtsABC strains. As shown in Table 3, supernatant from wild-type cells could promote growth of all strains except the double sirA::Km DhtsABC mutant, supernatant derived from H1331 (Newman Dsbn) could only promote growth of wild-type and sirA::Km strains, and supernatant derived from H1665 (Newman Dsfa) could only promote growth of wild-type and DhtsABC mutant strains. As described above, spent culture supernatant from H1666 was unable to promote growth of any S. aureus strain, including wild-type S. aureus (see also Table 1). Culture supernatants of the sfa mutant strain containing the S. aureus sfa locus (on plasmid pEV90) promoted growth of all strains except those containing htsABC deletions (Table 3). As a second method to confirm the involvement of HtsABC in staphyloferrin A uptake, concentrated material extracted from the supernatant of sbn mutant cells (i.e. staphyloferrin A) was incubated with 55Fe-labelled FeCl3 and provided to Newman and H1262 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 7, Newman cells readily transported iron in complex with staphyloferrin A while H1262 cells were devoid of transport. The transport observed in Newman cells was energy-dependent since KCN-treated cells were incapable of uptake. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the sfa gene cluster in S. aureus synthesizes staphyloferrin A, and

uptake of staphyloferrin A into the cell is mediated by the HtsABC transporter in an energy-dependent process. S. aureus FhuC is the ABC transporter ATPase necessary for transport of S. aureus siderophores The sirABC and htsABC operons each encode a predicted solute-binding protein (i.e. SirA and HtsA) and a predicted permease component of an ABC transporter (i.e. SirBC and HtsBC). Each operon notably lacks a gene encoding the ATPase component of an ABC transporter. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that the ATPase required for the transport of Sbn-derived siderophore was FhuC (Speziali et al., 2006), encoded by the first gene of the fhuCBG operon; FhuCBG, along with either FhuD1 or FhuD2, are together also required for transport of hydroxamate-type siderophores (Sebulsky et al., 2000; 2003; 2004; Sebulsky and Heinrichs, 2001). Most notably,

fhuCBG mutants were more growth attenuated in ironchelated media than sirA or sirB mutants alone (Speziali et al., 2006), suggesting that fhuC was also required for transport of another molecule that promoted ironrestricted growth. Here, we demonstrate that this second siderophore molecule is staphyloferrin A. This conclusion is based on the observation that H1074 (Newman DfhuCBG) is incapable of using siderophore (or concentrated supernatant) from any S. aureus strain (wild type or other) to promote iron-restricted growth, while H1074 containing plasmids expressing fhuC is capable of using all concentrated supernatants, except of course those derived from Dsbn Dsfa strains (see Table 3). Note that, in contrast, the transport of exogenous hydroxamate siderophores (e.g. ferrichrome) requires intact FhuCBG. The sfa-hts locus is conserved in coagulase-negative staphylococci In contrast to the sir-sbn locus which, among the staphylococci, has only so far been identified in S. aureus (Dale et al., 2004a), the sfa-hts locus is conserved in coagulase-negative staphylococci, at least the ones for which genomic sequence information is available. As shown in Table 4, predicted S. aureus Hts and Sfa products share significant similarity with predicted protein products from Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. saprophyticus. sfaABCD and htsABC from S. epidermidis complement S. aureus mutants To determine whether coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) sfa homologues are functionally analogous to those in S. aureus, we were interested to determine whether the S. epidermidis sfa genes would complement the S. aureus sfa growth defect and, second, whether a siderophore would be made that could be transported

through S. aureus HtsABC. As shown in Fig. 8, growth of the siderophore-deficient S. aureus mutant H1666 (i.e. Dsbn Dsfa) was equivalently augmented when containing the sfa locus in trans from either S. aureus or

S. epidermidis. Interestingly, the multicopy sfa genes were incapable of significantly altering growth kinetics when introduced into strain H1331 (Newman Dsbn), indicating that multicopy sfa genes cannot compensate for lack of Sbn protein activity. Evidence that the sfa homologues from S. epidermidis synthesize staphyloferrin A is provided by the result that sfa genes in trans, whether from S. aureus or from S. epidermidis, in H1666 (i.e. Newman Dsbn Dsfa) produced culture supernatant capable of promoting growth of wild-type S. aureus and S. aureus DsirA, but not DhtsABC mutants of S. aureus (Table 3). As described above, S. epidermidis (as well as other CoNS, see Table 4) contain homologues of the S. aureus hts genes. S. aureus and S. epidermidis htsABC genes in trans (in pEV55 and pEV93 respectively) were capable of complementing the inability of strain H1262 (Newman DhtsABC) to use siderophore (i.e. concentrated supernatant) prepared from Dsbn mutant strains (see Table 5), illustrating that HtsABC functions to transport staphyloferrin A in both staphylococcal species. Crystal structure of apo-HtsA identifies a positively charged binding pocket To provide insight into the function of HtsA in S. aureus, the X-ray crystal structure of HtsA was solved. The structure consists of residues Thr-38­Lys-327, which excludes 15 N-terminal residues following the Cys-22 lipidation site

that together likely form a flexible anchor. HtsA is comprised of mixed a/b N-terminal and C-terminal lobes bridged by a single a-helical backbone (Fig. 9). The ligand-binding groove is shallow and dominated by a large basic patch. The overall fold places HtsA among the class III periplasmic binding protein family. Recently, several protein structures from this class have been determined, all functioning as receptors for metal uptake systems. Of particular relevance, this family includes two siderophore-binding proteins, FhuD and CeuE (Clarke et al., 2000; Muller et al., 2006), and three haem-binding proteins, IsdE, ShuT and PhuT (Grigg et al., 2007; Ho et al., 2007). A search by the Dali server reveals the Campylobacter jejuni enterochelin receptor, CeuE (r.m.s.d. of 2.7 Å and 24% identity over 261 residues), the Bacillus subtilis bacillibactin receptor, FeuA (r.m.s.d. of 3.4 Å and 21% identity over 261 residues), and the E. coli ferrichrome uptake receptor, FhuD (r.m.s.d. of 2.9 Å and 23% identity over 254 residues), are the most similar structures in the database. To investigate ligand binding within the groove, the ligand-bound CeuE, FhuD, ShuT, PhuT and IsdE structures were superposed onto HtsA. When superposed, the ligands bound to these structures overlay in highly similar lateral locations within the binding groove. The corresponding region of HtsA contains a large patch of positive electrostatic potential contributed mainly by six Arg residues (Arg-86, 104, 126, 299, 304 and 306) that are directed into the groove (Fig. 9B and C). This arrangement of positively charged side-chains in the ligandbinding groove would favour an interaction with the anionic staphyloferrin A molecule.

Discussion
Many bacteria and fungi use the synthesis and transport of siderophores as an effective means by which to acquire iron in situations where, biologically at least, it is present at extremely low concentrations. In this study, we have characterized an iron-regulated locus in S. aureus that is comprised of three transcripts (see Fig. 2) responsible for the synthesis of the siderophore staphyloferrin A and its import. This report is the first to describe and characterize mutants in the staphyloferrin A-dependent iron acquisition strategy. Our data linking the presence of NWMN_2079­ 2082, in both strain Newman and RN6390, with the presence of staphyloferrin A in iron-starved culture supernatants are in agreement with a recently published article demonstrating that the same locus, when introduced into E. coli, conferred upon the heterologous host the ability to produce staphyloferrin A (Cotton et al., 2009). From available genomic information, the sfa-hts locus is present in all S. aureus strains, and also in coagulase-negative staphylococci including S. epidermidis,

S. haemolyticus and S. saprophyticus. Based on the study of Meiwes et al. (1990), staphyloferrin A was detected in the culture supernatant of the vast majority of staphylococcal strains tested. It was a surprising finding, then, that we observed no iron-starved (i.e. serum) growth defect for mutants defective in the staphyloferrin A ironacquisition system (either sfa or hts deletion mutants). The staphyloferrin A system was, however, important for iron-starved growth in strains that were defective in the Sbn-Sir iron-acquisition system; interestingly, however, the staphyloferrin A-dependent growth promotion in Sir or Sbn mutants was significantly delayed in comparison with wild type. It is not currently known whether this represents a delay in expression of the staphyloferrin A system, or whether it is less effective than the Sbn-Sir system at competing with serum transferrin for iron. Certainly, there are several other examples of bacteria that produce more than one siderophore, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa that synthesizes pyoverdines and pyochelin, and Bacillus anthracis that secretes bacillibactin and petrobactin. There are several explanations for why bacteria would require more than one siderophore, in spite of the perceived costs of maintaining and expressing additional genes, gene products and metabolites. Important recent findings demonstrate that some bacteria produce what are known as stealth siderophores. Examples of stealth siderophores include salmochelin, produced by Salmonella, and petrobactin produced by B. anthracis. In the latter example, while it has been documented that bacillibactin is an efficient iron scavenger, it is also effectively bound by the immune protein siderocalin; the mechanism of action of siderocalin is thus to inhibit bacterial iron acquisition as a virulence factor. Petrobactin is not bound by siderocalin and thus evades this host defence strategy, allowing the bacteria to remain virulent (Abergel et al., 2006). With defined iron acquisition mutants in S. aureus, future studies aimed at determining the requirement for both staphylococcal siderophores in different in vivo environments are feasible. In light of the fact that S. aureus efficiently scavenges haem as an iron source, future studies can now also include an evaluation of siderophore production versus haem acquisition in the highly varied sites of S. aureus infection. In this study, we demonstrate the requirement for the Hts transporter in staphyloferrin A uptake. This result was not altogether surprising given that the two gene sets (sfa and hts) are adjacent on the staphylococcal chromosome and close proximity of genes encoding siderophore biosynthetic enzymes and cognate iron­siderophore receptor proteins is not unusual in bacteria. However, the unusual aspect of this result was that HtsABC had previously been implicated in haem uptake (Skaar et al., 2004b). This was based on the observation that S. aureus containing a mariner transposon insertion in hts, when

provided differentially isotopically labelled iron bound to either transferrin or haem, preferentially used iron bound to transferrin instead of haem (Skaar et al., 2004b). Sinorhizobium meliloti 2011 shares the permease and ATPase components of its haem and hydroxamate siderophore uptake systems (Cuiv et al., 2008), providing precedence for what may also occur in S. aureus with HtsABC. Indeed, this and our previous studies (Speziali et al., 2006) have demonstrated that FhuC ATPase is required for two siderophore uptake systems (Sir and Hts). It is therefore possible that the HtsBC permease may be involved in haem and siderophore uptake. It is less likely that HtsA would be required for haem binding (versus staphyloferrin A binding) since the crystal structure of HtsA identified a binding pocket lined with positive charges, suggesting that an interaction with anionic staphyloferrin A would be favoured over the hydrophobic haem molecule. The arrangement of positively charged residues in the binding groove of HtsA is most similar to that seen in the structure of ligand-bound CeuE. In CeuE, the net negative charge of L,L-{[Fe(mecam)]2}6- (an enterobactin mimic) is balanced by Arg-117, Arg-204 and Arg-248 that interact directly with the oxygen atoms on the siderophore (Muller et al., 2006). Also, the structures of the E. coli enterobactin receptor FepA and the ferric citrate receptor FecA have been determined in complex with their cognate iron chelates (Newton et al., 1997; Buchanan et al., 1999; Yue et al., 2003). As in CeuE, FepA and FecA both have large regions of positive electrostatic potential at the ligand binding site that is contributed by several Arg residues that function to neutralize the net negative charge of the bound iron chelates. Although a transporter that would be unspecific enough as to recognize an iron­siderophore complex and haem is unlikely, there is precedence in the literature for transporters with broad substrate specificity. Indeed, the dipeptide transporter in E. coli (Dpp) has been shown to transport the haem precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (Verkamp et al., 1993), a haem precursor, as well as haem (Letoffe et al., 2006). It is also possible, however, that the strong phenotype of the hts mutant for transferrin iron over haem iron that was observed by Skaar et al. (2004b) could be explained if mutation of hts were to lead to overproduction of one or both siderophores and/or other iron­siderophore transporters. While not affecting the extracellular haem-iron pool this would result in the removal of more iron from transferrin. Unfortunately, nothing is currently known of the downstream regulatory affects on the various transporters in S. aureus that result from mutations in one or more iron transporters, and there are more than a half dozen ABC transporters expressed in S. aureus that have known or putative roles in iron acquisition. Given the suggested role of Hts in haem acquisition, we did use the mutant strains described

in this study to test for possible defects in utilization of haem as a sole iron source. We did not observe any deficiency in utilization of haem as a sole iron source (using haem disc bioassays on solid media) for hts deletion strains (data not shown), whereas there was a significant decrease in haem acquisition observed for an isdE mutant in the same assay (data not shown) or in prior liquid growth assays (Grigg et al., 2007). Combining the hts deletion with the isdE mutation did not further decrease the ability to use haem as a sole iron source in the plate bioassays (data not shown). Clearly, more detailed investigations will be required to sort out the role of Hts in haem acquisition. Collectively, our data demonstrate that S. aureus possesses two distinct genetic loci, sir-sbn and hts-sfa, encoding the necessary machinery for synthesis and utilization of two siderophores, and expression of each locus is highly dependent on limiting iron concentrations. We also provide sufficient evidence to conclude that transport of both siderophores is driven by ATP hydrolysis dependent on the FhuC protein, which we suggest complexes with each of the Hts and Sir ABC transporters.

sbn operon deletion
The sbnABCDEFGHI::Tet knockout allele consisted of the tetracycline resistance cassette, excised from plasmid pDG1513 (Guérout-Fleury et al., 1995) with restriction enzymes SspI and NaeI and blunted with Klenow enzyme, flanked by DNA sequences homologous to regions upstream of sbnA and immediately downstream of sbnI. The knockout allele was cloned to the temperature-sensitive E. coli/ S. aureus shuttle vector pAUL-A (Chakraborty et al., 1992), and subsequently passaged through S. aureus RN4220 prior to transduction into S. aureus RN6390. Recombinant RN6390 was cultured at 30°C to mid-log phase before the incubation temperature was shifted to 42°C and bacteria were incubated a further 16 h before being plated onto tryptic soy agar (TSA) containing tetracycline. Colonies were screened for sensitivity to erythromycin, indicating a loss of pAUL-A backbone DNA following integration of the knockout allele into the chromosome via homologous recombination on either side of the tetracycline resistance cassette. The sbn::Tet deletion was mobilized to other S. aureus backgrounds by transduction using phage 80a (Novick, 1991).

Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth media
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 6. Bacteria were cultured at 37°C, unless otherwise indicated. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 mg ml-1) and erythromycin (300 mg ml-1) for E. coli selection; chloramphenicol (5 mg ml-1), tetracycline (4 mg ml-1), kanamycin (50 mg ml-1), neomycin (50 mg ml-1) and erythromycin (3 mg ml-1) for S. aureus selection. For molecular-genetic manipulations, bacteria were grown in Luria broth (for E. coli ) or tryptic soy broth (for S. aureus). Iron-restricted media were either (i) the chemically defined Tris-minimal succinate medium (Sebulsky et al., 2004) containing 0.1 mM ethylenediamine-di-o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (LGC Promochem), (ii) RPMI broth (Gibco BRL) containing 1% w/v casamino acids (Difco), or (iii) a 60:40 ratio of complement-inactivated horse serum (SigmaAldrich) to TMS broth. All solutions and media were made with water purified through a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore). Solid media were obtained by addition of Bactoagar (Difco) to 1.5% w/v.

NWMN_2082­2079 (sfaA­D) locus deletion
The NWMN_2082­2079::Km knockout allele consisted of the kanamycin resistance cassette, excised from plasmid pDG780 (Guérout-Fleury et al., 1995) flanked by DNA sequences homologous to regions downstream of NWMN_2082 and NWMN_2079, and cloned into the E. coli/ S. aureus shuttle vector pLI50 (Lee, 1992). An S. aureus suicide vector was generated from this plasmid by introduction of a frameshift mutation into repB (encoding the Grampositive replicase protein) following NsiI digestion and Klenow fragment blunting in absence of nucleotides. This plasmid, incapable of unassisted replication in S. aureus, was introduced into S. aureus strain RN4220 carrying unmodified pLI50, enabling replication through complementation in trans with wild-type RepB. The construct was then transduced to S. aureus strain RN6390 and recombinant bacteria were plated onto TSA containing kanamycin and neomycin. Colonies were screened for sensitivity to chloramphenicol, indicating a loss of vector DNA following homologous recombination on either side of the kanamycin resistance gene. The NWMN_2082­2079::Km deletion was mobilized to other S. aureus backgrounds by transduction using phage 80a.

Recombinant DNA methodology
Routine manipulation of recombinant DNA was performed as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). Plasmid DNA was isolated from bacteria using Qiaprep mini-spin kits (Qiagen), as directed. For plasmid isolation from S. aureus, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in P1 buffer containing 50 mg ml-1 lysostaphin (Sigma Aldrich) prior to addition of lysis buffer P2. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow fragment and Pwo polymerase were obtained from

htsABC locus deletion
The DhtsABC::Tet knockout allele targeted the 5 and 3 noncoding regions around htsABC. The 5 arm was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and cloned SacI to BamHI to plasmid pUC19, followed by a PCR amplified 3 arm cloned BamHI to XbaI. A tetracycline resistance cassette was excised from plasmid pDG1513 with restriction enzymes BamHI and BglII and cloned into the arms at the BamHI site.

Staphyloferrin A synthesis and transport in S. aureus 959

The knockout allele was excised and cloned to SacI, XbaIdigested pAUL-A. Passaging to S. aureus and selection for chromosomal integration were performed as described above for the sbn operon deletion.

Bacterial growth curves
Bacteria were cultured for 12 h in TMS broth then 12 h in TMS broth containing 100 mM 2,2-dipyridyl (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed twice in saline, and diluted 1:100 into 60% horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich) ­ 40% TMS broth. For iron replete media, 50 mM FeCl3 was included. Cultures were grown under constant, medium amplitude shaking in a Bioscreen C machine (Growth Curves, USA). Optical density was measured at 600 nm every 30 min. However, for clarity of growth curve figures, data are shown only at 2 h intervals.

sociation was performed with a mass range 60­500 m/z using Argon as collision gas. Variable collision energy of 20­30 V was applied to obtain an informative fragmentation spectrum. For comparative purposes, we performed the LC-MS experiments using the method as described above which was similar to that recently reported (Cotton et al., 2009), but with the addition of EDTA which greatly increased the detection level of staphyloferrin A, since contaminating metal ions, including those bound to staphyloferrin A, have been shown to interfere with detection (Liu et al., 2005).

Plate bioassays
The ability of supernatant concentrates to promote the ironrestricted growth of S. aureus was assessed using siderophore plate bioassays, performed as previously described (Sebulsky et al., 2000) with modifications. Briefly, S. aureus strains were incorporated into TMS agar (1 ¥ 104 cells ml-1) containing 10 mM EDDHA. Concentrates (10 ml) were added to sterile paper disks which were then placed onto the plates. Growth promotion was quantified by measuring the radius of growth around the disc after 36 h at 37°C.

Siderophore detection and characterization
To measure levels of siderophore activity in culture supernatants, chrome azurol S (CAS) shuttle solution (Schwyn and Neilands, 1987) was used as previously described (Dale et al., 2004a). Briefly, dilutions of culture supernatants were mixed with equal volumes of CAS shuttle solution and incubated in darkness at room temperature for 45 min. Siderophore units were calculated as follows: [(A630 of sterile culture medium - A630 of sample)/(A630 of sterile culture medium)(inverse of dilution factor)] ¥ 100%. Ultimately, siderophore units were normalized to a culture OD600 of 1.0. To prepare concentrated supernatants, S. aureus strains were grown with aeration in TMS broth containing 0.1 mM EDDHA for 40 h at 37°C. Cells were removed by centrifugation and supernatants were lyophilized. Dried supernatant was extracted with methanol (one-fifth the original supernatant volume), passed through Whatman No. 1 filter paper to remove insoluble material, and rotary evaporated. Material was solubilized in water to 5% of the original supernatant volume. To purify the siderophore present in supernatant concentrates, material was passed across an amberlite IRA402 (Fluka) anion exchange column. The column was washed extensively with water before elution with 3 M formic acid. Bioactive fractions were subjected to a desalting step using a C18 cartridge (Applied Separations, Allentown, PA) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.

Fe transport assays

Mass spectrometry
Eluent desalted across a C18 cartridge (see above) was dried and re-dissolved in 100 ml of water containing 100 mM EDTA and 0.1% formic acid. Twenty microlitres of the sample was injected into an LC-MS/MS system comprised of a Waters CapLC with a Phenomenex Jupiter Proteo 90 A column (150 ¥ 1.0 mm), 4 mm coupled to a Q-TOF (micro, Waters) mass spectrometer. Separation was carried out at a flow rate of 40 ml min-1 with a gradient starting at 0% B for 4 min, ramping to 15% B in 4 min, then ramping to 90% B in 4 min and holding for 4 min. Solvent A was water and solvent B was 95% acetonitrile, both with 0.1% formic acid. LC-MS analysis was performed with electrospray in negative ion mode with a scan range 200­950 m/z. Collision-induced dis-

Transport assays were performed as described (Dale et al., 2004b) with modifications. Briefly, S. aureus strains were grown overnight in TMS minimal media, diluted to an OD600 of 0.2 in a 20 ml volume of the same medium supplemented with 0.2 mM EDDHA and grown to an approximate OD600 of 1. Cells were harvested by filtering 5 ml of culture onto 0.45mm-pore-size membrane filters (Supor®-450, Pall Corp.), washed twice with 5 ml of 0.9% NaCl, resuspended in 5 ml of the same solution and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before the assay. A mixture containing staphyloferrin A iron binding equivalents to 500 mM ferrichrome (according to a CAS assay standard curve), 16 mM 55FeCl3 and 2 mM nitrilotriacetic acid was prepared 30 min before the assay; 7.5 ml of this mixture was incubated with 750 ml of cells and 200 ml aliquots were removed at intervals, filtered onto 0.45-mmpore-size membrane filters (Supor®-450, Pall Corp.), and washed twice with 10 ml of 100 mM LiCl. The membranes were allowed to dry and were counted in scintillation fluid by using the tritium channel of a scintillation system LS 6500 (Beckman). Where stated, cells were treated with KCN (10 mM) for 15 min at room temperature prior to the uptake assay.

Real-time PCR
Iron-starved cells were washed twice in saline buffer and diluted 1:100 into HS-TMS broth. Cultures were grown at 37°C with ample aeration to mid-logarithmic phase (OD600 ~ 1.0), then partitioned into two aliquots of equal volume. One aliquot from the pair was spiked with 50 mM FeCl3. Growth was allowed to resume for 1 h, then cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C. RNA was extracted using RNeasy kits (Qiagen) as directed. RNA (100 ng) was reverse

transcribed and PCR amplified using the iScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad), as directed, with primers listed in Table 1, in a Rotor-Gene 6000 Real Time Analyser (Corbett Life Sciences). Quantification relative to housekeeping gene gyrB was performed using the comparative CT method according to User Bulletin #2: ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (2001) (Applied Biosystems). For each representative RNA extraction, one-step reactions were performed in triplicate.

Protein overexpression and purification
HtsA, lacking the signal peptide, was expressed in E. coli ER2566 by cloning htsA, amplified from the genome of S. aureus using primers HtsA fwd (NheI) and HtsA rev (BamHI), into pET28a(+) digested with NheI and BamHI. E. coli cells containing the HtsA expression construct were grown to mid-log phase at 37°C with aeration before, IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside) (0.4 mM) was added, and cells were cultured for an additional 16 h at room temperature. The cells were lysed in a French pressure cell at 10 000 psi, and the lysate was centrifuged at 27 000 g for 15 min to remove unbroken cells and debris, prior to centrifugation at 150 000 g for 45 min to remove insoluble material. The soluble sample was applied to a HisTrap (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mM imidazole (binding buffer), and the 6xHistagged protein was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 mM imidazole (elution buffer) using a 0­80% elution buffer gradient over 15 column volumes. Excess imidazole was removed by passing the purified protein through a G-25 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline; after elution, NaCl was added to 150 mM. The purity of the protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Sambrook et al., 1989).

centrifugation at 100 000 g for 30 min Soluble 6xHis-HtsA was purified using a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) and then the 6xHis-tag was removed by thrombin digestion. Protein was further purified by cation exchange chromatography using a Source 15S column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.8) and a NaCl gradient (0­500 mM) for elution. HtsA was dialysed into 20 mM Tris (pH 8) for all crystallization experiments. Selenomethioninelabelled HtsA was produced by methods previously described (Van Duyne et al., 1993) and purified similarly to native HtsA. Apo-HtsA crystals were grown by hanging drop vapour diffusion at room temperature. Well solutions contained 0.1 M HEPES (pH 6.8) and 24­30% Jeffamine ED-2001. Hanging drops were made from 1 ml of a 25 mg ml-1 protein solution and 1 ml of well solution. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen after brief immersion in well solution supplemented with 15% glycerol. Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data for selenomethionine-labelled protein crystals was collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beam line 7-1. The data were processed and scaled using Mosflm (Leslie, 1992) and SCALA (Evans, 1997). Crystals grew in the space group P21 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Phases were determined using Solve (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999) and Resolve (Terwilliger, 2000; 2003) with an initial figure of merit of 0.40 that was improved to 0.80 with density modification. An initial model was built using ArpWARP (Perrakis et al., 1999). Native protein crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Canadian Light Source on beam line 08ID-1 and was processed and scaled using HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). For both structures, manual building and refinement was completed using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and Refmac5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) respectively. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are shown in Table 7.

Generation of anti-HtsA antisera
Antibodies recognizing HtsA, purified as described above, were generated by ProSci (Poway, CA) using custom antibody production package 1 protocol. Antisera were used at a 1:2000 dilution for Western blots.
