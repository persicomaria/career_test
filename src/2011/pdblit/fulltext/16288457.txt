ABSTRACT Bacterial nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases, which convert NMPs to nucleoside diphosphates (NDP), are investigated as potential antibacterial targets against pathogenic bacteria. Herein, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of GMP kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (GMPKMt). GMPKMt is a monomer with an unusual specificity for ATP as a phosphate donor, a lower catalytic efficiency compared with eukaryotic GMPKs, and it carries two redox-sensitive cysteines in the central CORE domain. These properties were analyzed in the light of the high-resolution crystal structures of unbound, GMP-bound, and GDP-bound GMPKMt. The latter structure was obtained in both an oxidized form, in which the cysteines form a disulfide bridge, and a reduced form which is expected to correspond to the physiological enzyme. GMPKMt has a modular domain structure as most NMP kinases. However, it departs from eukaryotic GMPKs by the unusual conformation of its CORE domain, and by its partially open LID and GMP-binding domains which are the same in the apo-, GMP-bound, and GDPbound forms. GMPKMt also features a unique GMP binding site which is less close-packed than that of mammalian GMPKs, and in which the replacement of a critical tyrosine by a serine removes a catalytic interaction. In contrast, the specificity of GMPKMt for ATP may be a general feature of GMPKs because of an invariant structural motif that recognizes the adenine base. Altogether, differences in domain dynamics and GMP binding between GMPKMt and mammalian GMPKs should reveal clues for the design of GMPKMt-specific inhibitors.

identification of new targets for more effective drugs.1 Nucleotide metabolism enzymes lead to the production of nucleotide triphosphates (NTP) which are DNA and RNA precursors and critical regulators in multiple cellular pathways. They have been identified as essential in M. tuberculosis2 and other pathogens3,4 and have begun to be explored as potential antibacterial targets.5,6 An obligatory step in NTP synthesis is the conversion of nucleoside monophosphates (NMP) to nucleoside diphosphates (NDP), which involves the reversible transfer of the -phosphoryl group of ATP to an NMP acceptor by NMP kinases (NMPKs). In bacteria, five NMPKs are responsible for these activities: adenylate kinase (AMPK) for the phosphorylation of AMP/dAMP, CMPK for CMP/dCMP, GMPK for GMP/dGMP, UMPK for UMP, and TMPK for dTMP (reviewed in Yan and Tsai7). Representative structures of bacterial NMPKs are available for each family8 ­10,47 including, for M. tuberculosis, crystal structures of TMPKMt11­13 and NMR structures of AMPKMt.14 Bacterial NMPKs share with their eukaryotic counterparts a modular architecture consisting of three subdomains, but in many cases they also have features that are unique to bacteria or even bacterial subgroups. For instance, CMPK from Escherichia coli has a unique insert in the CMPbinding subdomain, which is critical for catalysis.9 Another example is TMPKMt, in which the position of Mg2 and an invariant catalytic arginine are permuted compared with the human enzyme.12 Such differences of bacterial NMPKs to their eukaryotic counterparts may be essentially silent as long as natural substrates are used, but may prove valuable for the discovery of specific antibac-

terial compounds. In TMPK, these differences turn 3 -azidodeoxythymidine from a substrate in human TMPK to a competitive inhibitor in TMPKMt,15 and were subsequently used to design specific and potent inhibitors of the mycobacterial enzyme.5,16 ­19 In an effort to identify novel properties of mycobacterial NMPKs, which could be the target for specific antituberculosis drugs, we report herein the structural and biochemical characterization of GMPKMt, an essential enzyme for mycobacterial growth.2 Structures of GMPKs are currently known for the enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (GMPKSc) in the apo form20 and in complex with GMP,21 for the mouse (Mus musculus) enzyme (GMPKMm) bound to ADP and GMP, and for the enzyme from E. Coli (GMPKEc).48 GMPKs consist, as all NMPK structures solved to date except UMPK, of a CORE domain with the LID domain and the NMP-binding domain (called GMP domain hereafter) attached to it (reviewed in Yan and Tsai7). The CORE domain is a five-stranded -sheet flanked by three -helices, and it carries the P-loop (or Walker A motif), a highly conserved motif that binds the -phosphate of the ATP donor in NMPKs.23 It is flanked on one side by the GMP domain, which carries the phosphate acceptor binding site with invariant residues that determine the enzyme specificity for GMP. This domain also provides residues to the phosphate transfer catalytic site, including two arginines that are invariant in NMPKs and a tyrosine that is specific to GMPKs. Opposite to the GMP domain, the LID domain carries conserved residues that complete the ATP-binding site and provides arginines to the catalytic site. Although no GMPK has been crystallized with all combinations of acceptor and donor nucleotides, comparison of the GMPK structures to each other and to the more extensively characterized AMPK and TMPK structures, have led to a model of activation of GMPKs by step-wise closure of the LID and GMP domains onto the CORE domain upon ATP and GMP binding, thus assembling their catalytic machinery. Herein, we show that GMPKMt is a monomer, with a catalytic efficiency that is lower than that of eukaryotic GMPKs and an unusual specificity for ATP as a phosphate donor. GMPKMt carries redox-sensitive cysteines in the CORE domain, whose physiological thiol form was analyzed in the crystal structure of GMPKMt-GDP. This structure was shown to be similar to that of oxidized GMPKMt-GDP, thus validating the use of the oxidized apo-, GMP-bound, and GDP-bound crystal structures for the analysis of specific features of the mycobacterial enzyme. These structures and their comparison to known GMPK and related NMPK structures identify the GMP-, ATP-, and Mg2 -binding sites, and the residues that are involved in phosphoryl transfer catalysis. They show that although the specificity for ATP may be a general feature of GMPKs because of a conserved motif that recognizes the adenine base, the mycobacterial enzyme departs from other known GMPKs in several unexpected aspects. These include an unusual domain conformation and the replacement of a critical tyrosine by a serine in the GMP domain that creates a unique GMP-binding site. Altogether, our

analysis identifies structural differences between GMPKMt and mammalian GMPKs that may prove valuable for the design of GMPKMt-specific inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals Nucleotides, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA polymerase, and coupling enzymes for determination of GMK activity were from Roche Applied Science. T4 DNA ligase and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs, Inc. Affi-Gel Blue Gel were obtained from Bio-Rad, Ultrogel AcA54 from Sigma, and ultra pure urea from ICN Biochemicals, Inc. GMPKEc is a gift from Anne-Marie-Gilles (Institut Pasteur, Paris); NDP kinase is a gift from Ioan Lascu (IBGC, Bordeaux, France); the antibody directed against histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein from E. coli (H-NS) is a gift from Evelyn Krin (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Cloning, Purification, and Biochemical Characterization The 627-bp fragment corresponding to the gmk gene from M. tuberculosis (RV1389 gene in the M. tuberculosis genomic information database Tuberculist, http://genolist. pasteur.fr/TubercuList) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using M. tuberculosis genomic DNA as the matrix. The amplified gmk gene was cloned into the pET22b plasmid (Novagen, Inc.) digested with the same enzymes. Three clones containing the M. tuberculosis gmk gene and overexpressing GMPKMt were characterized and one of them (harboring plasmid named pHL40-2) was kept for further studies. Cultures were grown in 2YT medium supplemented with 100 mg/mL ampicillin and 30 mg/mL chloramphenicol. Production of recombinant GMPKMt was induced with isopropyl-1-thio- -D-thiogalactoside (1 mM final concentration) when cultures reached an absorbance of 1.5 at 600 nm. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 3 h after induction. Bacteria suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM DTT (buffer A) were disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, the bacterial extract was loaded onto a Blue-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer (10 mg of protein/mL of swollen gel). The column was washed with 10 volumes of 0.5 M NaCl in buffer A. GMPKMt was eluted with 4 volumes of 1 M NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing GMPKMt were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a 1 110 cm Ultrogel AcA54 column equilibrated with buffer A and fractions of 1.8 mL were collected at a flow rate of 9 mL/h. Protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad Bradford kit or by amino acid analysis on a Beckman system 6300 high-performance analyzer after 6 N HCl hydrolysis for 22 h at 110°C. Titration of thiol groups in native GMPKMt were determined with aliquots of enzyme free of exogenous reducing agent by passage over a Sephadex G-25 M column (PD-10, Amersham). Thiol estimations were calculated on a basis of a molar absorbance of 13,500 for 5-carboxy-4-nitrophenol at 412 nm.24 The absorbance at 412 nm was read against a blank treated in parallel without GMPKMt.

GMPK activity was determined at 30°C using the coupled spectrophotometric assay at 334 nm as previously described25 (0.5 mL final) on an Eppendorf ECOM 6122 photometer. The reaction medium (0.5 mL final volume) contained either 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.2 mM NADH, 0.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 units of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and NDP kinase (forward reaction), or 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM glucose, 0.4 mM NADP , 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 units of hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (reverse reaction). One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 mole of the product formed in 1 min at 30°C and pH 7.4. AMPK activity was assayed with and without preincubation of GMPKMt for 20 min at room temperature with antibodies directed against AMPKEc. Antibodies against H-NS from E. coli were used as a control. IMPK activity was assayed by overnight incubation of GMPKMt with IMP and ATP at 1 mM, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of the resulting nucleotides. The thermal stability was tested by incubating purified GMPKMt (1 mg/mL) in buffer A at temperatures between 30° and 60°C for 10 min, and determining the residual activity of the sample. GMPKMt exhibits a low thermal stability (Tm 45°C) in contrast to other mycobacterial NMPKs. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed at 20°C on a Beckmann Optima XL-A analytical centrifuge using an An-60 Ti rotor and a cell with a 12-mm optical path length. Samples (150 L) in buffer A with or without 0.4 M KCl at approximately 0.5 g/ L were centrifuged at 20,000 and 25,000 rpm. Radial scans of absorbance at 280 nm were taken at 2-h intervals. Equilibrium was reached after 14 h. Data were analyzed by the XL-A program supplied by Beckman. The partial specific volume of GMPKMt was calculated from the sequence. The molecular mass of GMPKMt was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (21,963.71 1.47 Da) and corresponds to that calculated from the deduced protein sequence without the initiation methionine (21,964.10 Da). All fluorescence measurements were performed using a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorometer thermostated at 25°C. Emission spectra were measured between 310 and 410 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). Upon excitation at 295 nm, GMPKMt exhibits a fluorescence emission spectrum with a maximum at 347 nm, indicating that the unique Trp89 of GMPKMt is exposed to the solvent. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Refinement GMPKMt was concentrated to 7.5 mg/mL and incubated with GMP, GDP, or ganciclovir-monophosphate added at a concentration of 10 mM before crystallization. In one experiment, 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) was added in the protein sample in the presence of GDP and in the reservoir to prevent the formation of the disulfide bridge between Cys40 and Cys193. We refer to the TCEP-treated crystal structure as GMPKMt-GDP or reduced GMPKMt-GDP, and to the other structures as oxidized apo-GMPKMt, GMPKMt-GMP, and

GMPKMt-GDP. All crystallizations were done by the vapor diffusion method at room temperature using hanging drops of 1 L of protein and 1 L of a reservoir solution containing 15% (w/v) xylitol, 3.5 M sodium chloride in either 0.1 M bicine pH 9 (GMP and ganciclovir-monophosphate) or 0.1 M sodium HEPES pH 7.5 (GDP) buffers. Crystals grew within 2­3 days to dimensions of 150 ­200 m. Before freezing in liquid ethane, crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 35% (w/v) xylitol, 2.5 M sodium chloride, and 0.1 M of the crystallization buffer without added nucleotide. An initial data set was first collected for the ganciclovirmonophosphate incubated GMPKMt crystal at beam line ID29 ( 0.9756 Å) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Initial phases for these crystals were obtained by molecular replacement using the 2.16 Å structure of oxidized apo-GMPKMt (S. Chan, M.R. Sawaya, L.J. Perry, D. Eisenberg, unpublished results deposited as a PDB entry, code 1S4Q) after previous attempts using GMPKSc, GMPKMm, and GMPKEc as models had failed. No electron density could be identified for the nucleotide, indicating that the crystals contained in fact the oxidized apo-enzyme. Subsequently, 20 crystals of oxidized GMPKMt co-crystallized with either GMP or GDP were tested and 11 diffraction data sets were collected on ESRF beamline ID29 ( 0.9756 Å) as a test case of the DNA project for automatic screening and data processing.26 Data sets with resolution better than 2.3 Å were indexed and scaled using XDS and XSCALE.27 The data set for the reduced GMPKMt-GDP crystals were collected on our in-house rotating anode generator ( 1.541 Å). All crystals were found to be isomorphous to oxidized apo-GMPKMt crystals. The refined oxidized apo-GMPKMt structure was used for calculating Fourier difference maps for the oxidized GMPKMt-GMP and GMPKMt-GDP, and reduced GMPKMt-GDP structures. All refinements were performed with CNS28 and Refmac529 using TLS parametrization with the CORE, GMP, and LID domains as rigid bodies, and model building was done with O30 and TurboFrodo (http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr). The 19 N-terminal extension and the 6 ­7 C-terminal residues are not visible in the electron density for any of the four refined structures. The final refined models of oxidized apo-, GMP-bound and GDPbound, and reduced GDP-bound GMPKMt have respectively 93, 91, 92, and 92% residues in the most favored regions, and no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The statistics of data collection and refinement are summarized in Table II. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with entry codes: 1ZNW and RCSB032936 for oxidized apoGMPKMt, 1ZNX and RCSB032937 for oxidized GMPKMtGMP, 1ZNY and RCSB032938 for oxidized GMPKMt-GDP, and 1ZNZ and RCSB032939 for reduced GMPKMt-GDP.

Reaction velocities were measured at different ATP concentrations (100, 200, 300, and 400 M) over a range of GMP concentrations (50 ­300 M) for the forward reaction, and at different ADP concentrations (100, 200, 300, and 400 M) over a range of GDP concentrations (25­300 M) for the reverse reaction. The different parameters were calculated considering the reaction to follow a random ordered bi bi mechanism. The kinetic parameters of GMPKSc are from Li et al.35, those for GMPKEc are a personal communication from Anne-Marie Gilles (Institut Pasteur, Paris).

the Cibacron Blue dye for nucleotide binding sites32 and has proved effective on many NMPKs.15,33,34 After gel permeation chromatography, GMPKMt was recovered at an approximate molecular weight of 30 kDa, corresponding to a monomeric protein. This was confirmed by equilibrium sedimentation ultracentrifugation, which yielded a molecular mass of 24,261 1,014 Da that was independent of the ionic strength up to 0.4 M KCl. GMPKMt was purified in the presence of EDTA and a reducing agent, which effectively inhibits the proteolysis of other mycobacterial NMPKs expressed in the same E. coli strain. After dialysis in a buffer devoid of DTT, its two cysteines (Cys40 and Cys193) were found to be reactive with 5,5 -dithiobis(2nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) under native conditions. Moreover, the GMPK activity was not affected by the binding of the Ellman's reagent to these cysteines. The kinetic parameters of the forward and reverse reactions (Fig. 1) catalyzed by GMPKMt are indicated in Table I. Compared with GMPKEc and GMPKSc, the mycobacterial enzyme exhibited significantly lower kcat values in both the forward and reverse reactions. The Km values of GMPKMt for either substrate were in the same range as

those of GMPKSc (except a higher Km value for ADP) but higher than those of GMPKEc. Unlike GMPKSc, which at concentrations of GMP above 0.22 mM exhibited a decrease of the apparent maximum velocity of up to 50%,35 GMPKMt was not inhibited by an excess of GMP (2 mM). NMPKs show, in general, little specificity for the phosphate donor, but have a narrow specificity for the phosphate acceptor (reviewed in Anderson et al.36 and Van Rompay et al.37). Accordingly, GMPKMt was found to display a narrow specificity for GMP as the phosphate acceptor. dGMP was also accepted as a substrate, although with only 8% of the GMP catalytic rate. Phosphorylation of AMP (8% of GMP rate) and IMP (2.5%) could also be detected, both of which could be ruled out as enzymic activities due to GMPKMt by using alternative assays. Phosphorylation of AMP by GMPKMt was completely abolished by prior incubation of GMPKMt with antibodies directed against AMPKEc, indicating that trace amounts of chromosome-encoded AMPKEc were responsible for this activity. Under similar experimental conditions, the GMPKMt activity with GMP was unaffected. Likewise, no IDP could be identified by HPLC analysis after incubation of a large excess of GMPKMt with IMP and ATP. On the contrary, a GDP peak was identified after incubation of GMPKMt with GMP and ATP. Thus, the IMPK activity may be attributable to contamination of the IMP sample used in the enzymic coupled assay. However, our analysis of the specificity of GMPKMt for the NTP phosphate donor revealed an unusual specificity for ATP. Only dATP was also found to be effective as a phosphate donor (80% of the ATP catalytic rate), but the reaction rate decreased to less than 2% with GTP and UTP and no activity was detectable for TTP and CTP.

cysteines are reduced, were solved at 2.5, 2.1, 2.35, and 2.3 Å, respectively (crystallographic statistics summarized in Table II). All four crystals are isomorphous, and contain one GMPKMt monomer per asymmetric unit [Fig. 2(a)]. There is a clear electron density for the GMP and GDP nucleotides, whereas crystallization trials using ganciclovir monophosphate, the phosphorylated form of the antiviral prodrug ganciclovir, which is an inhibitor of mammalian GMPKs,38 yielded the apo-GMPKMt structure. The reactive cysteines, Cys40 in 1 and Cys193 in 7, face each other in the CORE domain, where they exist as free thiols in the presence of the reducing agent TCEP [Fig 2(b), top panel] and form a disulfide bridge in its absence [Fig. 2(b), bottom panel]. The disulfide bridge is also present in the apo-GMPKMt structure deposited in the PDB (S. Chan, M.R. Sawaya, L.J. Perry, D. Eisenberg, unpublished results, PDB code 1S4Q). It differs in nature from that recently described in the phosphatase Cdc25b, where one of the reactive cysteines is part of the P-loop and blocks the active site when engaged in a disulfide bond.39 Because of the reducing environment found in bacterial cytoplasms,40 the disulfide bond in GMPKMt is unlikely to occur in the physiological form of the enzyme, although recent analysis suggest that stabilization of intracellular bacterial proteins by disulfide bonds may be more widespread than classicaly recognized.49 Comparison of the reduced and oxidized GMPKMt structures shows however that the disulfide bridge does not yield significant conformational changes. GMPKMt features the conserved structural domains of GMPKs from yeast mouse and E. coli [Fig. 2(a, c)],

although with significant departures [Fig. 3(a)]. The best conserved domain is the GMP domain (residues 52­102), which superimposes remarkably with all other GMPKs with an average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) on C atoms of 0.5 Å. However, it differs locally by a twoglycine insert that protrudes between strands 5 and 6 (Gly94 and Gly95) and is not found in eukaryotic enzymes [Fig. 3(a)]. In GMPKMm-GMP-ADP, this loop comes in contact with the LID, suggesting that the corresponding interaction may be different in the closed conformation of GMPKMt. The LID domain is in an open conformation, as seen by the fact that Arg155 and Arg166, which are expected to contribute to the stabilization of the phosphoryl transfer transition state, are at a distance from GMP [Fig. 2(a)]. This domain does not behave as a rigid body in general. In GMPKMt, its helix 6 is in a straighter conformation than that found in closed GMPK structures of GMPKs with a closed conformation [Fig. 3(a)]. The CORE domain, however, has the same topology but a surprisingly high RMSD compared to other GMPKs, ranging from 1.31 Å (GMPKEc-GMP) to 1.75 Å (apo-GMPKSc), whereas it is 0.8 Å on average between other GMPKs. The major conformational differences are located at helices 1 and 7, which are displaced relative to the five-stranded -sheet. This may result from the unusual conformational flexibility at the P-loop and/or the replacement of the (A/T)GKS motif, found in the P-loop of most GMPKs, by the more bulky 32VGKS35 sequence [Fig. 3(a)]. Motion of the NMP and LID domains is a common feature of NMPKs, yielding a variety of conformations for the apo- and mono nucleotide-bound enzymes, whereas

Invariant residues are shown on a black background, residues similar in at least 50% of the sequences on a gray background. On the top of the sequences are indicated the two cysteines (purple triangles, boxed), the secondary structures of the GMPKMt, and the limits of the GMPKMt domains. The CORE domain includes all regions outside the GMP and LID domains. Hinges between domains (as defined by comparison with other GMPK structures) are in gray. The unique GMP loop in GMPKMt is boxed in cyan. Residues that interact with GMP are marked by # and residues of the putative ATP-binding site are marked by stars. Residues of the ATP-binding site unique to GMPKs are boxed in red.

binding of both substrates yields a closed conformation that is similar between all NMPKs (reviewed in Yan and Tsai7). In GMPKs, binding of GMP alone induces the closure of the GMP domain,20,21 whereas co-binding of ADP in the mouse enzyme further results in the fully closed conformation.22 Surprisingly, the apo-, GMPbound, and GDP-bound GMPKMt structures have the same domain closure, which is distinct from that of either apo- [Fig. 3(b), left panel] or GMP-bound [Fig. 3(b), right panel] forms from other GMPKs. To determine the degree

of closure of the GMP domain, the interactions of GMPKMt with GMP were compared with those of GMPKMm-GMPADP and GMPKSc-GMP (Table III). This shows that GMP lacks a subset of interactions with the CORE domain (Asp101, Val102, and Asp103 in GMPKMm, corresponding to Glu119, Val120, and Asp121 in GMPKMt) and with the CORE/GMP domain linker (Thr101Mm). Thus, although the GMP domain is more closed in our ensemble of GMPKMt structures than in apo-GMPKSc, it retains essentially the characteristics of an open conformation. Alto-

The phosphate acceptor site is essentially identical whether GMP, GDP, or no substrate is bound, indicating that it behaves as a preformed pocket. Together with the observation that the GMP domain of GMPKMt is in an open conformation, this

suggests that this domain contains all the features necessary to bind GMP regardless of the level of domain closure. Comparison with the GMPKSc-GMP and GMPKMm-GMPADP crystal structures shows that GMPKMt forms both conserved and unique interactions with GMP. Conserved interactions include the recognition of the guanine base by an invariant glutamate (Glu88) and of the -phosphate by invariant arginine and tyrosine residues (Arg57, Arg60, and Tyr69) [Table III, Fig. 4(a)]. Strikingly, this conserved mode of interaction also accommodates major sequence differences near the sugar and -phosphate moieties of GMP [Figs. 2(c), 4(b) and Table III]. GMPKMt lacks a

conserved tyrosine (Tyr81 in GMPKMm), which binds to the -phosphate of GMP and is in van der Waals contact with the ribose in all other GMP-bound GMPKs. Mutation of the corresponding residue to phenylalanine in GMPKSc GMP resulted in both a 20-fold increase in Km and 131-fold decrease of kcat.41 The corresponding residue in GMPKMt, Ser99, is too small to form a hydrogen bond with the -phosphate, but it interacts with a water molecule that fills the cavity where the tyrosine aromatic side-chain is located in other GMPKs. Besides, the 5/ 6 loop in GMPKMt (92IHGGLHRS99) differs in length and sequence from most other bacterial GMPKs ( GNyY) and from eukaryotic GMPKs (FSGNlY) (where stands for aliphatic/ aromatic residues, capital letters for invariant residues and lowercase letters for conserved residues) [Figs. 2(c), 3(a), and 4(b)]. This results in the replacement of van der Waals interactions with the ribose and -phosphate moieties of GMP mediated by Phe76 and Tyr81 in GMPKMm by Ile92 and His93 in GMPKMt. Altogether, the GMPbinding pocket in GMPKMt has a different shape and establishes alternative interactions with the -phosphate and ribose of GMP compared with the mammalian enzyme, resulting in a unique environment for the substrate in the mycobacterial enzyme. The GMPKMt-GDP structures show that the base and ribose moieties of GDP are bound as those of GMP, and GDP does not interact with the CORE or LID domains. A surprising observation is that the -phosphate of GDP has moved relative to its position in the GMP-bound structure, such that Tyr69 and Arg57 interact with different -phosphate oxygens in GMP, but with the same oxygen in GDP [Fig. 4(c)]. The -phosphate interacts only with Tyr69 from the GMP domain, a residue that forms a bidendate interaction with both phosphates. By comparison with structures of related NMPKs in complex with transition state analogs,42­ 44 the -phosphate is not positioned for efficient phosphate transfer, and does not correspond therefore to a postcatalytic intermediate. Given the open conformation of GMPKMt in this series of structures, the conformation of

GDP may be representative of the reaction product in the course of dissociating from the enzyme. DISCUSSION Domain Structure and Dynamics of GMPKMt The structure of GMPKMt is distinct from that of all other GMPK structures solved so far in both the conformation of the CORE domain, and the position of the LID and GMP domains relative to the CORE. Domain closure is now established as a general mechanism by which binding of ATP and NMP substrates induces the catalytically competent, fully closed conformation of NMPKs. In the case of GMPKs, a variety of conformations have been characterized in yeast and mammalian enzymes. In this study, GMPKMt seems to depart from this general rule, as the apo-, GMP-, and GDP-bound forms have a very similar level of domain closure, which corresponds to a fully open conformation based on the analysis of GMP/protein and domain/domain interactions. This suggests that the conformations that have been trapped in the crystal may correspond to an early intermediate of the GMP-binding step preceding closure of the GMP domain, and a late intermediate of the GDP product release step after reopening of the GMP domain. Experimental probing of this hypothesis may require approaches other than crystallography, such as NMR possibly in combination with hinge residue mutations. Assuming that the structure of the catalytically competent GMPKMt is fully closed as those of GMPKs from other species and of related NMPKs, our series of structures suggests that the amplitudes and directions of domain closure movements are significantly different in GMPKMt than in other enzymes of the same family. This may result from the unusual conformation of the CORE domain, which in turn may yield a specific conformation of the interdomain hinges. Because the hinge regions are both flexible and adopt species-specific conformations, they may constitute candidate sites of interest for the design or screening of specific noncompetitive inhibitors

capable of blocking the conformational changes that are required for the GMPK activity. Conservation of the ATP and Mg2 Binding Sites and of the Phosphate Transfer Machinery The ATP-binding site of GMPKs has been located in the GMPKMm-ADP-GMP structure at the P-loop in the CORE domain and the CORE/LID interface. It is identical in GMPKMt, including the adenine binding residue Arg151 [Fig. 2(a,c)]. However, we identified a specificity of GMPKMt for ATP as a phosphate donor which is unusual among NMPKs. We propose that this may result from a previously unappreciated difference in the binding site of the adenine base in GMPKs compared with other NMPKs. Unlike other NMPKs, the coordination sphere of ATP in GMPKs includes the specific recognition of the N6 and N7 atoms, which is mediated by an invariant asparagine in the 9/ 7 loop of the CORE domain (Asn171 in GMPKMm, Asn186 in GMPKMt). This residue is part of an invariant three-dimensional motif that also comprises a proline pair in the 8- 5 loop in the CORE/LID linker (Pro142/Pro143 in GMPKMt) [Fig. 2(a, c)]. This specific arrangement of the adenine-binding site may contribute to the specificity of GMPKMt for ATP as a phosphate donor, and may be a general property of GMPKs that diverges from other NMPKs. No direct information is available yet on the stabilization of the transferred phosphoryl group by GMPKs at the transition state. However, insight into this mechanism can be derived from crystal structures of related NMPKs in complex with transition state analogs (such as human TMPKHs-ADP-AlF3-TMP,42 AMPKSc-AP5A,43 and D. discoideum CMP/UMPKDd-ADP-AlF4-UMP44). Arg155 in 5, Arg166 in 6, and Lys34 in the P-loop are thus predicted to bridge the - and -phosphates of ATP, and Arg 60 in the LID domain and Arg57 in the GMP domain to bridge the -phosphate of ATP to the -phosphate of GMP. Another critical component of catalysis is Mg2 , whose binding to GMPKs is enhanced by the presence of both substrates45 but has not been observed in crystal structures. In GMPKMt, it is predicted to comprise Ser35 in the P-loop and an acidic residue, Glu115, in the water-mediated coordination shell. This ensemble of residues is invariant or highly conserved in all GMPKs [Fig. 2(c)]. Thus, the phosphoryl transfer mechanism in GMPKMt should not depart from that of GMPKs from eukaryotes, or, more generally, from that of NMPKs. A Unique GMP-Binding Site in GMPKMt Suggests Strategies for the Design of Specific Inhibitors Whereas the ATP and Mg2 binding sites and the catalytic residues are essentially identical between GMPKMt and eukaryotic GMPKs, the GMP domain of GMPKMt reveals unexpected differences to the consensus binding site that has been described in yeast and mammalian GMPKs. The most critical differences are located at Ser99, which removes an enzyme/ -phosphate interaction, and Ile92/His93, which creates a less close-packed ribose GMP environment. These differences do not affect the Km ,

which is similar for the mycobacterial and other GMPKs, in contrast with the mutation in GMPKSc of Tyr78 (corresponding to Ser99 in GMPKMt) to phenylalanine which causes a 20-fold decrease.41 This may be explained by rescue in GMPKMt of the lost hydrogen bond by a water molecule. However, we suggest that the Tyr/Ser replacement in GMPKMt may explain its lower kcat, in agreement with the fact that the mutation of the equivalent residue to Phe in GMPKSc results in a 131-fold decrease in kcat. Remarkably, the 92IHGGLHRS99 motif encompassing the 5- 6 loop in the GMP domain is specific to the sequences of GMPK from the actinomycete-related mycobacteria and corynebacteria, two bacterial groups that contain the causative agents of major human diseases that include tuberculosis, leprosy, and diphtheria [Fig. 2(c)]. Thus, GMPKs from mycobacteria and corynebacteria, including GMPKMt, feature a GMP domain that is unique among both bacterial and eukaryotic GMPKs. In particular, these GMPKs are predicted to depart from the human enzyme, which has 88% identity and has every GMP-interacting residue identical with the mouse enzyme whose structure and GMP-binding site are known.46 As a consequence, the essential M. tuberculosis gmk gene, although encoding an enzyme conserved in all life kingdoms, may eventually be the target for specific drugs. Our structural and biochemical characterization now provides a robust background for such an approach. In the search of GMP analogs that could function as inhibitors, future investigations would aim at creating interactions that would be specific to GMPKMt, together with modifications that would result in the inhibition of the phosphate transfer reaction. Based on the structural analysis reported herein, modifications of the C8 and N7 on the guanosine moiety may be envisioned to introduce GMPKMt-specific interactions with Ser99, whereas introducing a bulky group on the ribose moiety could block domain closure, thus preventing the assembly of the catalytic site.
