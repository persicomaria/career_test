C ORRIGENDUM

Two of the hydrogen bonding interactions shown in Figure 10 were drawn incorrectly (dashed line from P4 to Gln-430 for HscA and from L4 to Gln-433 for DnaK). The corrected figure follows (the figure legend is correct).

Corrigendum

On page 1273 of the article the word "hydroxyl" should be replaced with "carbonyl" on two occasions. The corrected paragraph follows: "Peptide backbone hydrogen bonding interactions involved in the HscA(SBD) complex are compared with those in the DnaK(SBD) complex in Figure 10. Several of the peptide carbonyl oxygen atoms are positioned similarly in the two complexes (see Figure 8), and the hydrogen bonding patterns of HscA(SBD) and DnaK(SBD) share similarities despite having opposite peptide orientations. The most notable difference is the hydrogen bond pattern involving the central proline residues. The imine nitrogen of Pro-4 in the central pocket can not form a hydrogen bond with Thr-424 of HscA(SBD) like that formed between the amide of Leu-4 (position 0) and the carbonyl of Ser-427 of DnaK(SBD). Instead, the amide of Val-5 (positionC1) participates in hydrogen bonding in the HscA(SBD) complex. In addition, the twist in the backbone in region of the Pro-Pro sequence results in a shift in the carbonyl oxygen of Pro-3 away from the carboxamide of Gln-430 and the carbonyl group of Thr-424 so that it is unable to form direct hydrogen bonds like those formed between Leu-4, Gln-433 and Ser-427 of the DnaK(SBD) complex. Instead, a buried water molecule is bound between Pro-3, Gln-430 and Thr-424 in the HscA(SBD)-peptide complex allowing hydrogen bonding to occur over a greater distance. This is the only ordered water present in the peptide binding cleft and serves to restore hydrogen bonding at theC1 position. The general hydrogen bonding pattern of the HscA(SBD)-peptide complex, involving each of the three central residue carbonyl groups and one amide of the peptide, is thus similar to that found in the DnaK(SBD)-peptide complex in spite of the opposite orientation of the bound peptides." The authors would like to apologise for any confusion caused.
