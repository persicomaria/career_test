Abstract Second and third domains were prepared from Japanese quail ovomucoid and association equilibrium constants, Ka s, were measured at 25³C and pH 8 for these domains with trypsins from ten mammalian species: cat, cow, dog, guinea pig, hog, horse, man, rabbit, rat, and sheep. The values ranged from 108 M31 to 1010 M31 for the second domain^trypsin associations and from 106 M31 to 108 M31 for the third domain^trypsin associations. Changes in Ka values for the interactions between the trypsins and each domain are attributed to slight changes in surface conformation caused by the residue changes in the inhibitor-binding region other than the S1 pocket of the trypsin species. The representative of such residue changes is assumed to be the one observed at residue 217 of trypsin molecule. Concerning each trypsin, the Ka value with the second domain was always higher than that with the third domain. However, the ratios between the two equilibrium constants varied from 3 to 60 depending upon trypsin species. This means that amino acid changes in enzyme-contact residues other than the P1 site of the Kazal-type inhibitor can make it possible to recognize even a slight difference in inhibitor-binding surface among the enzymes with the same S1 pocket and highly similar overall three-dimensional structure. ß 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Protein proteinase inhibitors are widely distributed in nature. They are well recognized to be very important for the control of many biological functions [1,2]. Furthermore, the system of the inhibitors and their cognate proteinases is an interesting example of speci¢c protein^protein recognition [3].

Avian ovomucoids are abundant egg-white proteins and are responsible for most of the inhibitory activity against serine proteinases in the egg white. They consist of three tandem homologous domains, each of which is an actual or potential proteinase inhibitor of the Kazal family [4]. Of these, the third domains from 100 avian species have been isolated and sequenced by Laskowski and coworkers [5], who have also studied on the relationship between the amino acid sequence and inhibitory activity of the Kazal-type inhibitor in order to construct `sequence to reactivity algorithm', that could allow the prediction of an association equilibrium constant from a knowledge of the sequence of the inhibitor [6,7]. For the elucidation of such a structure^function relation-

ship, however, it is still required to accumulate the data on the equilibrium constant. Japanese quail ovomucoid (OMJPQ) is the ¢rst ovomucoid of which the third domain (OMJPQ3) was crystallized and analyzed for its crystal structure [8,9]. In addition, this ovomucoid is unique because its third domain as well as the second domain (OMJPQ2) is an inhibitor against trypsin-like proteinases. In usual, ovomucoid second domains inhibit trypsin-like proteinases, while the third domains are the inhibitors of chymotrypsin-like proteinases. Another interesting thing concerning OMJPQ is that it can strongly inhibit human trypsin, which is scarcely inactivated by many other ovomucoids. For example, chicken ovomucoid second domain is a strong inhibitor of bovine trypsin but is ine¡ective toward human trypsin. We have also reported that OMJPQ shows di¡erent inhibitory activities against several mammalian trypsins including human trypsin [10]. The ¢ndings imply that the associations between mammalian trypsins and OMJPQ domains are diverse, though the diversity seems to be less than that of the associations between the trypsins and other ovomucoid domains. Therefore, it is of great interest to know the Ka values for the domains of OMJPQ with mammalian trypsins which have the same S1 pocket and very similar tertiary structures to each other. The Ka data are probably useful not only for the understanding of speci¢c protein^protein recognition but also for research on design of drugs or proteins with various biological functions. In this paper we describe the values of equilibrium constants, Ka s, for OMJPQ2 and OMJPQ3 with ten mammalian trypsins and discuss variations in the Ka values. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Pure OMJPQ was prepared as reported previously [11]. Bovine trypsin (Type III), porcine trypsin (Type IX) and K-N-benzoyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide HCl (Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Pancreas acetone powders of cat, dog, guinea pig, horse, rabbit, rat and sheep were also purchased from Sig-

ma. Human pancreatic juice was obtained from Shiga Medical University (Ohtsu, Japan) and stored at 380³C. K-N-Benzoyl-D,L-arginine-p-nitroanilide HCl (Bz-D,L-Arg-pNA) and K-N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide HCl (Bz-Arg-pNA) were obtained from Peptide Institute (Minoh, Japan). The burst substrate of p-nitrophenyl-pP-guanidinobenzoate HCl (NPGB) was purchased from Nutritional Biochemical (Cleveland, OH, USA). All other chemicals used were of special grade. 2.2. Preparation of second and third domains Puri¢ed OMJPQ was digested by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease at 37³C in 0.1 M Tris^HCl bu¡er (pH 8.3) containing 0.2 M NaCl according to the method of Kato et al. [4]. The third domain was separated from the conjugate of the ¢rst and second domains, and the conjugate was further digested by thermolysin to yield the second domain. Puri¢cation of the released second and third domains were carried out as described previously [12]. 2.3. Preparation of trypsins from various mammals Trypsins except for bovine and hog trypsins were prepared from mammalian pancreas acetone powders and human pancreatic juice, and ¢nally puri¢ed by a¤nity chromatography on an immobilized rice bran trypsin inhibitor column [13] as reported previously [10]. Puri¢ed enzymes were shown to be homogeneous by Disc-PAGE at pH 4.0. Among the puri¢ed enzymes, trypsins from dog, man, and rat were judged to be cationic type by their electrophoretic mobility. 2.4. Measurement of Ka Association equilibrium constants (Ka s) for the ovomucoid domains with mammalian trypsins were measured by the method of Green and Work [14] with an extensive modi¢cation [15]. Stock solutions of various trypsins (1034 ^1035 M) were standardized by active-site titration with NPGB [16]. The concentration of a stock solution of the second domain (1035 M) was measured by titration with the standardized dog cationic trypsin using a 1037 M enzyme concentration with Bz-D,L-Arg-pNA as substrate.

the other hand, the concentration of a stock solution of the third domain (1035 M) was determined by amino acid analysis. The standardized enzyme and inhibitor solutions were then diluted with 0.1 M Tris^HCl bu¡er (pH 8.0) containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.005% (w/v) Triton X-100. A constant volume of each diluted enzyme solution was mixed with incremental volumes of a diluted inhibitor solution, and the volume of the mixtures was adjusted to 3 ml with the Tris bu¡er. To complete the equilibrium the mixtures were incubated at 25³C for 3 h and 20 min in the case of 1039 M and 1038 M initial enzyme concentrations, respectively. The free enzyme concentrations (1039 M order) of the mixtures were estimated by enzyme reaction using 10 Wl of the substrate Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (20 mg/ml of dimethyl sulfoxide) and those (1038 M order) of the mixtures the substrate Bz-Arg-pNA (10 mg/ml of dimethyl sulfoxide). The data of the free enzyme concentrations together with the initial inhibitor concentrations were ¢tted to a theoretical equation of Bieth [17] with the aid of a computer program for the nonlinear least-squares analysis developed in the laboratory of Prof. M. Laskowski Jr. 3. Results 3.1. Association equilibrium constants for the domains with mammalian trypsins Trypsins from ten mammalian species were titrated with OMJPQ2 at enzyme concentrations of 1039 M order. Fig. 1 shows a typical titration curve of rabbit trypsin with the inhibitor. In this case, a diluted solution of rabbit trypsin (5.1U1039 M) was incubated with incremental amounts of the second domain at 25³C for 3 h. Free trypsin concentrations were calculated from the residual trypsin activities measured by monitoring the hydrolysis of Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA. This ¢gure also indicates three parameters, log Ka , initial trypsin concentration ([E0 ]), and inhibitor-enzyme equivalence factor (I/E factor) meaning a correction factor of initial inhibitor concentrations which allow the best-¢t curve, with their error analysis. In our Ka measuring system, only the results showing low errors ([E0 ] error 6 1% of [E0 ], log Ka error 6 0.1) and a suitable I/E factor (0.9 6 I/E fac-

tor 6 1.1) as in Fig. 1 were adopted. We estimate that the errors in our Ka determinations are about þ 20%, and it can be said that there are signi¢cant di¡erences between two comparisons when they are greater than a factor of 1.5. The equilibrium constants for OMJPQ2 with ten mammalian trypsins are summarized in Table 1. The Ka values ranged from 108 M31 to 1010 M31 . The highest value among them, 1.1U1010 M31 , was obtained from the association of the second domain with dog cationic trypsin and the lowest, 2.0U108 M31 , from the second domain with human cationic trypsin. Trypsins from ten mammalian species were then

the Ka values for the second domain with the trypsins ranged from 108 M31 to 1010 M31 , and those for the third domain with the trypsins from 106 M31 to 108 M31 . It was also indicated that concerning each trypsin the Ka value with the second domain was always higher than that with the third domain. However, the Ka ratios of the second/third domains were not the same. They varied from approx. 3 to 60. The high ratios of approx. 60 were shown by dog, rabbit and man, the middle ratios from 15 to 35 by rat, cat, guinea pig and sheep, and the low ratios less than 10 by cow, hog and horse. 4. Discussion Japanese quail ovomucoid consists of three tandem homologous domains, each being an actual or potential protein proteinase inhibitor of the Kazal family, and the second and third domains show the inhibitory activity against trypsin-like proteinases. The reason why they can inhibit such proteinases is that each reactive-site P1 (notation of Schechter and Berger [19]) residue of the second and third domains is occupied by lysine, as shown in Fig. 2. However, it is also known that they cannot inhibit every proteinase of trypsin type. For example, OMJPQ2 could not inhibit Streptomyces griseus trypsin, a trypsinlike proteinase of microbial origin (C.W. Chi and M. Laskowski Jr., unpublished data). Nagata and Yoshida have also reported a similar result [20]. At present, it is obvious that residues in contact with a serine proteinase other than the P1 residue of a Kazal-type proteinase inhibitor also matter a great deal for the interaction with the proteinase [21]. This conversely means that the inhibitor-binding region other than the S1 speci¢city pocket of the proteinase is likewise important for the interaction with the inhibitor. Therefore, the residue changes in this inhibitorbinding region are assumed to in£uence the interaction. OMJPQ2 is homologous with OMJPQ3, so that the three-dimensional structure of the second domain seems to be very similar to that of the third. The crystal structure of OMJPQ3 was determined by Weber et al. [8] and the model building studies of complexes of the third domain with serine proteinases were also reported [9]. From these studies

titrated with OMJPQ3 at enzyme concentrations of 1038 M order. In this experiment, OMJPQ3 used was carbohydrate-free and polymorphic [18]. Table 1 also summarizes the equilibrium constants for OMJPQ3 with ten mammalian trypsins. Ka values were distributed between 1.9U108 M31 and 3.2U106 M31 . The highest and lowest values were obtained from the associations of the third domain with dog cationic trypsin and human cationic trypsin, respectively. This situation was the same as the case of the second domain, but these values were about two orders of magnitude lower than the respective values with the second domain. 3.2. Ratios between equilibrium constants for trypsins with the second domain and the third domain Table 1 also presents the ratios of the equilibrium constant of the second domain to that of the third with ten mammalian trypsins. As mentioned above,

and other crystallographic studies [22^24], LaskowH ski has postulated that the residue sets of P1 ^P6 , P1 ^ H H H H P3 , P14 , P15 , and P18 of third domains from ovomucoids make a contact with serine proteinases. Because of the homology with OMJPQ3, the trypsincontact residue positions of OMJPQ2 are presumed to be the same as those of the third domain. These positions are presented by asterisks in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the above crystallographic studies also suggest the positions of the inhibitor-contact residues of trypsins. The complete amino acid sequences of trypsins from cow [25], dog [26], hog [27], man [28] and rat [29] are shown in Fig. 4, in which the possible inhibitor-contact residues deduced from the studies [9,22^24] concerning three-dimensional structures of proteinase-inhibitor complexes are enclosed in boxes. In this study, we measured Ka values for the interactions of the homologous domains of OMJPQ2 and OMJPQ3 with ten mammalian trypsins being anticipated to have the same S1 pocket and very similar tertiary structures. The Ka values shown in Table 1 clearly indicated that each domain associated di¡erently with ten mammalian trypsins. As expected above, we demonstrate that these di¡erences are due to the amino acid changes in the inhibitor-binding region other than the S1 speci¢city pocket of trypsins. In fact, it is recognized that there are amino acid substitutions in residue positions 39, 97, 169, 171, 175 and 217 among the 25 assumed inhibitorcontact residues of trypsins, as shown in Fig. 4. These residue positions are all in the inhibitor-binding region other than the S1 pocket. That is to say, Tyr 39 and Asn 97 in bovine trypsinogen are in conH tact with Asn 21 (P3 ) and Glu 12 (P7 ), respectively, of pancreatic secretary trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) in their complex [23]. In residue positions 169 and 171, Val 169 and Tyr 171 of S. griseus proteinase B (SGPB) make many contacts with Ala 15 (P4 ), Lys 13 (P6 ), Cys 16 (P3 ) and Thr 17 (P2 ) of turkey

ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3) [22]. Lys 175 in K-chymotrypsin and Gln 175 in bovine trypsinogen are in contact with Pro 14 (P5 ) in OMTKY3 [24] and Ser 14 (P5 ) in PSTI [23], respectively. In position 217, Ser 217 of SGPB makes contact with Pro 14 (P5 ) of OMTKY3 in their complex [22]. The same contact was also observed in K-chymotrypsin^ OMTKY3 complex [24], and Ser 217 in bovine trypsin was assumed to be contact with Pro 14 (P5 ) in OMJPQ3 by a model building study of their complex [9]. Probably, changes in the Ka values are attributed to a slight change in surface conformation caused by the residue changes in the inhibitor-binding region other than the S1 pocket of the trypsin species. It might be noted that the representative of such residue changes is the one observed at residue 217 of trypsin molecule. At this position, Ser 217 in bovine trypsin, Ala 217 in dog trypsin, Tyr 217 in hog and rat trypsins, and Asp 217 in human trypsin are seen, and a trypsin with bulkier amino acid at this position is believed to show weaker association with OMJPQ2. A similar tendency is also noted in the associations with OMJPQ3. The signi¢cance of this residue position has also been discussed in the case of the interaction of S. griseus trypsin with OMJPQ3 [30]. The relatively large (100-fold) di¡erence in Ka for the interaction of a OMJPQ domain with ten mammalian trypsins is also interesting in relation to the molecular evolution of trypsin(ogen)s. Recently, the molecular evolution of the vertebrate trypsinogens have been reported by Roach et al. [31] who presented 36 amino acid sequences of trypsin molecules. In these sequences, one can realize that there are many amino acid substitutions in the residue positions 39, 97, 169, 175 and 217, these being in the inhibitor-binding region other than the S1 speci¢city pocket of trypsins. Therefore, it seems likely that there is a possibility that the evolution of trypsin molecules is associated with the interaction with

trypsin inhibitors. Such an interaction may also imply selective advantage of the presence of multiple trypsin isozymes within an organism. Concerning each of the ten mammalian trypsins tested, the Ka value with the second domain was always higher than that with the third domain, as shown in Table 1. Comparison between amino acid H sequences (P9 ^P18 ) of OMJPQ2 and OMJPQ3 (Fig. 3) indicates the presence of many amino acid substitutions in the enzyme-contact positions other than the primary P1 site. Obviously, this is the reason why OMJPQ2 is di¡erent from OMJPQ3 in the inhibitory activity against mammalian trypsins. However, the Ka ratios of the second to the third domain were not the same in spite of an extremely close

similarity of the enzymes. Therefore, it is stated rather that amino acid changes in enzyme-contact residues other than the primary P1 position of the Kazal-type inhibitor can make it possible to recognize even a slight di¡erence in the inhibitor-binding surface among the enzymes with the same S1 pocket and highly similar overall three-dimensional structure. The P1 residue of standard mechanism protein inhibitors of serine proteinases is clearly important for the interaction with the enzymes. The nature of P1 greatly a¡ects the strength and speci¢city of the enzyme^inhibitor association. The additivity of the residue contributions to the free energy of association has also been argued from the interaction of serine

proteinases with ovomucoid third domains [32,33]. Furthermore, Qasim et al. [34] have recently reported that in canonical inhibitors, of which residues P4 H H P2 P3  exhibit the same Ramachandran angles [35], P1 residues are intersca¡olding additive. However, in this study the contribution of P1 residue of trypsin inhibitors is not a subject of discussion, since replacement of P1 Arg or Lys in a trypsin inhibitor by another amino acid probably disrupts the inhibitor but does not change the trypsin inhibitory activity. We think that the inhibitory speci¢city as a trypsin inhibitor originates from the residues other than P1 residue. We further believe that inhibitory speci¢city can be classi¢ed into two types, one being interenzyme speci¢city, meaning the inhibition against different types of proteinases like trypsin, thrombin, chymotrypsin, elastase and so on, and the other being intraenzyme speci¢city, which means the inhibition against proteinases of the same type but of di¡erent origin such as porcine elastase, human elastase and so on. It is probable that the former depends mostly on the nature of the P1 residue, and the latter on the overall nature of the residues other than the P1 residue. References
