Remarkably, two mutations (LeuH47Trp/ArgH100Trp) out of 36 total sequence differences suffice to switch the selectivity of 1E9 to that of the progesterone-binding antibody DB3. In contrast to the double mutant, which tightly binds multiple steroids with differently configured A­B ring junctions, the individual LeuH47Trp and ArgH100Trp single mutants both exhibit significantly greater specificity than DB3, preferentially binding 5pregnan-3-ol-20-one (Kd  5 nM) over other steroids. These findings illustrate how easily differently shaped binding pockets can be created through subtle changes to the same primordial germ line template.

Recognition of the universe of potential antigens constitutes a daunting challenge for the humoral immune system. Although the repertoire of antibody receptors is vast, containing an estimated 108 different germ line sequences,1 actual structural diversity is far more limited. The use of a common immunoglobulin framework2­4 places intrinsic constraints on the range and variety of combining sites that can be constructed for binding antigens. Even though shape and chemical complementarity to many different ligands can be achieved through sequence variation 5­7 and conformational pliability, 8 distinguishing closely related compounds sharing a few common features can be difficult. As a consequence, a certain level of cross-reactivity may be unavoidable, leading to problems such as allergy and autoimmunity. Crystallographic studies have shed light on the limits of antibody­antigen complementarity. The anti-progesterone antibody DB3, which recognizes progesterone (1) (Fig. 1) and other steroids (2­5)

(Fig. 1) with nanomolar affinity,9­11 is one of the best-characterized cross-reacting antibodies. Its heavy and light chains (Fig. 2) derive from the VGAM3.8 and VK5.1 gene families,12 respectively, which are frequently used to recognize small hydrophobic ligands.13 Steroids dock in a narrow, apolar pocket at the apex of the DB3 variable domain (Fig. 3a and b).14­16 The side chain of AsnH35 and conserved hydrophobic interactions with the steroid D-ring are particularly important for achieving high-affinity recognition. Nevertheless, the relative paucity of functional groups in steroid ligands limits the selectivity that can be achieved. Thus, the DB3 binding site accommodates three configurationally distinct groups of steroids without major structural rearrangement, maintaining interactions with the deeply buried D-ring while making use of different binding orientations of the steroid skeleton to place the A ring in different regions of the binding pocket.14,16 Small ligand-induced conformational changes help to maximize shape complementarity to the individual ligands. Residue TrpH100 is important in this regard. In the absence of ligand, its indole side chain moves into the active site to minimize exposed hydrophobic surface, but when a ligand enters the pocket, it provides a large and adjustable non-polar surface against which the steroid can pack.15

Fig. 1. Ligands screened to assess the cross-reactivity of DB3 and 1E9 variants. Antibody DB3 was elicited to a derivative of progesterone (1) and cross-reacts with corticosterone (2), 5-pregnane-3-ol-20-one (3), etiocholanolone (4) and 5-androstane-3,17-dione (5). Wild-type 1E9 was generated in response to the hexachloronorbornene derivative (6).

Antibody 1E9, which was generated against the hexachloronorbornene derivative (6) (Fig. 1),17 is derived from the same germ line family as DB3. The hapten is a stable analogue of the transition state of the [4+2] cycloaddition between tetrachlorothiophene dioxide and N-ethylmaleimide, and 1E9 catalyzes this Diels­Alder reaction with high efficiency.18 Although the heavy and light chains of 1E9 and DB3 (Fig. 2) are 80% and 89% identical,19 respectively, the encoded binding pockets have very different shapes (Fig. 3a and b versus c and d),18 consistent with the distinctive steric properties of 6

and progesterone (1). Indeed, the only common residues in both active sites are the hallmark amino acids AsnH35 and TrpH50 (Fig. 3). The strategically positioned hydrogen bond between AsnH35 and one of the carbonyl groups of 6 stabilizes the complex and has been shown to be essential for catalytic activity,20 while the indole ring of TrpH50 provides important -stacking interactions with the succinimide group of the hapten. Two somatic mutations, SerL89Phe and TrpH47Leu, which are unique to 1E9, are crucial for both the catalytic and binding properties of this antibody. 20 The presence of a

Fig. 3. Comparison of the DB3 and 1E9 antibodies. The combining site of the DB3­progesterone complex is illustrated, showing active-site residues (a) and the complementary molecular surface of the protein (b). Analogous close-up views of the 1E9 binding pocket with bound hapten 6 are depicted in (c) and (d). The hallmark residues for this immunoglobulin family, AsnH35 and TrpH50, are shown in purple, while the CDR H3 residues at positions H97, H100 and H100b, which make direct contact with bound ligand, are in magenta. The residues at positions L89 and H47, which were somatically mutated in 1E9, are shown in blue.

phenylalanine at position L89 significantly improves the packing interactions between the ligand and the active site. The substantially altered shape of the 1E9 binding pocket compared to DB3, on the other hand, can be directly ascribed to the introduction of leucine at position H47. The absence of a bulky tryptophan residue at this site allows the indole side chain of TrpH50 to adopt a different rotameric conformation than in DB3 (Fig. 3), resulting in a much better fit between protein and transition-state analog. The sequences of 1E9 and DB3 differ at a total of 36 positions (Fig. 2). Divergence is particularly strong in CDR H3, where 7 of 10 residues are different. To define the minimal set of changes that are required to impose the binding properties of DB3 onto the 1E9 scaffold, we initially replaced 5 active-site residues that project into the 1E9 binding pocket, namely Phe L89 , Leu H47 , Thr H97 , Arg H100 , and MetH100b (Fig. 3c), with their DB3 counterparts. The individual variants were produced as recombinant chimeric Fab fragments as described,20,21 and their ability to bind progesterone (1) was determined by fluorescence quenching. Representative titration data are shown in Fig. 4. The dissociation

constants are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated graphically in Fig. 5. Wild-type 1E9 cross-reacts with progesterone (1), as previously reported,19 although its affinity for the steroid is 10,000-fold weaker than for its cognate hapten, hexachloronorbornene (6). Mutating residues ThrH97, ArgH100, and MetH100b does not significantly alter the recognition of 6 or progesterone (1) (b 5-fold change in Kd compared to the starting antibody). The ThrH97Tyr and ArgH100Trp substitutions improve steroid affinity somewhat, whereas the MetH100b Phe mutation is deleterious. In contrast, reversion of the somatic mutation at position L89 decreases the affinity for both ligands by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. The effects of reverting the leucine residue at position H47 to tryptophan are even more dramatic. In this case, affinity for the original hapten decreases nearly 4000-fold, whereas progesterone binding actually improves 26-fold (Fig. 5). Residue H47 is thus the key to switching specificity in this system. The binding promiscuity of the LeuH47Trp single mutant was compared to that of the parent 1E9 and DB3 antibodies using a larger panel of steroids (Fig.

Fig. 4. Representative fluorescence quenching titration data. Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined in triplicate as previously described.20,21 Titration curves were recorded by stepwise addition of a ligand stock solution to a diluted solution of the chimeric Fab fragment (26 or 100 nM) and subsequent measurement of the fluorescence. Stock solutions of the appropriate ligand were prepared in acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide. Neither solvent interferes with the ligand­antibody interaction during titration (data not shown). The concentration of the ligand stock solution used for each mutant depended on the observed affinity between the former and the latter and varied between 15 M and 15 mM. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 290 and 340 nm, respectively, and the corresponding band passes were 8 and 16 nm. The high voltage of the detector was set to 900 V. These measurements were carried out in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 100 mM NaCl at 15 °C. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the Fab­ligand complex was calculated by non-linear least squares fitting of the observed fluorescence (F) obtained at various ligand concentrations (LT) to the equation F = FE - [(ET + LT + Kd) - [(ET + LT + Kd)2 - 4ETLT]1/2] × (FE - FEL)/2ET, where ET is the total Fab concentration, FE is the observed fluorescence intensity without any ligand, and FEL is the fluorescence intensity of the Fab­ligand complex at infinite ligand concentration.

997 dissociation constants. Recognition of the deeply buried steroid D-ring is sensitive to substitution,14 although the effect with 2 is less pronounced than previously reported,15 presumably reflecting the different assay modalities. Wild-type 1E9 crossreacts with all five steroids, albeit 3 to 5 orders of magnitude more weakly than with 6. 5-Pregnan3-ol-20-one (3), with a Kd of 120 nM, is the best steroid ligand; it binds 10 times more tightly than progesterone (1) and 100 times more tightly than the other compounds. The LeuH47Trp and ArgH100Trp 1E9 substitutions individually improve steroid binding across the entire series, and low nanomolar affinity for 3 (Kd  5 nM) is achieved in both cases. Nonetheless, neither variant fully mimics the properties of DB3. Based on these results, the LeuH47Trp substitution was combined with the other active-site mutations to gradually increase 1E9's resemblance to DB3. Specifically, four variants--PheL89Ser/LeuH47Trp, Phe L89 Ser/Leu H47 Trp/Met H100 b Phe, Phe L89 Ser/ LeuH47Trp/MetH100bPhe/ThrH97Tyr, and PheL89Ser/ LeuH47 Trp/MetH100b Phe/ThrH97 Tyr/ArgH100 Trp-- were prepared and characterized (Table 2, Fig. 6). Combining the distinctive PheL89Ser and LeuH47Trp mutations leads to a selectivity profile similar to that of the LeuH47 Trp single mutant, with reduced affinity for hapten (6) and enhanced binding to all the steroids compared with wild-type 1E9. Nevertheless, all measured Kd values are substantially higher than those seen for DB3. Sequentially adding the MetH100bPhe and ThrH97Tyr mutations affords only small incremental improvements in steroid binding, whereas inclusion of the ArgH100Trp substitution finally yields nanomolar affinity for all five steroids. The protein with all five DB3 residues exhibits dissociation constants that are within a factor of 4 of the values determined with authentic DB3 for each ligand tested. Not unexpectedly, none of these 1E9 variants catalyzes the Diels­Alder reaction between tetrachlorothiophene dioxide and N-ethylmaleimide, consistent with a significant

1). These include corticosterone (2), which resembles progesterone (1) but is additionally hydroxylated at C11 and C21; 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one (3), which has a saturated A ring with an  configuration at C5; and etiocholanolone (4) and 5-androstane-3,17dione (5), which both have a saturated A ring but a  configuration at C5. The latter two molecules differ in the oxidation state at C3. Etiocholanolone (4) has a C3 alcohol like 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one (3), whereas 5-androstane-3,17-dione (5) has a C3 ketone like progesterone (1) and corticosterone (2). Given the importance of TrpH100 in modulating steroid binding in DB3,15 the specificity profile of the ArgH100Trp 1E9 variant was also determined at the same time. The results are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 6. The steroid affinities for DB3 determined by fluorescence quenching are generally in good agreement with the previously published IC50 values determined by competitive ELISA measurements15,16 (Table 2). With the exception of corticosterone (2) and hapten (6), all the ligands exhibit low nanomolar

structural reorganization of the 1E9 active site due to their shared LeuH47Trp mutation. Thus, high-affinity steroid recognition can be achieved simply by targeting the residues lining the 1E9 binding pocket (Fig. 6). Mutations at other positions in the CDR

loops, or at more distant sites, are not required. Specificity in this system is evidently encoded entirely locally. Interestingly, not all five residues are needed to achieve this switch in specificity. In light of its

999 for structurally distinct molecules. At the same time, the fact that only a few mutations are needed to convert 1E9 into a potent steroid binder attests to the structural plasticity and functional adaptability of this scaffold. Given the relative paucity of functional groups in steroids 1­5 and the hexachloronorbornene derivative (6), the selectivity that can be achieved must largely be dictated by the steric complementarity of the ligand to the hydrophobic pocket. Progesterone (1) and 6 have very different shapes, and hence are readily differentiated through a relatively simple modification of the receptor scaffold, namely by mutating LeuH47. A leucine at this framework position is quite rare. DB3, like most antibodies in the database,24 has a tryptophan at this site. Replacement of the bulky tryptophan with a smaller leucine allows the indole side chain of the adjacent TrpH50 to undergo a 120° rotation, significantly deepening the active site while maintaining hydrophobicity.18 The excellent shape complementarity between 1E9 and 6 is a direct consequence of this dramatic conformational change. Reversion of this somatic mutation greatly diminishes 1E9's affinity for 6,20 abolishes catalysis of the Diels­Alder reaction between tetrachlorothiophene dioxide and N-ethylmaleimide,20 and leads to a significant gain in affinity for the entire set of steroids (Table 2). By combining LeuH47Trp with other active-site mutations, particularly the ArgH100Trp substitution, steroid affinity--and the functional resemblance of 1E9 to DB3--can be significantly improved. The LeuH47Trp mutation presumably reconfigures the binding site, creating a pocket of appropriate dimensions for steroid recognition, while the ArgH100Trp mutation provides a large, nonpolar surface that can be adjusted, as in DB3,14,15 to accommodate the structural differences of the various steroid ligands. Discrimination between ligands that are more alike than 1 and 6 represents a much greater challenge, and the LeuH47Trp/ArgH100Trp 1E9 double mutant, like DB3, poorly differentiates steroids with different C5 configurations. The high selectivity of the LeuH47Trp and ArgH100Trp single mutants, which preferentially bind 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one (3) over other steroids, is therefore notable. Discrimination is greatest for the ArgH100Trp variant (Fig. 6). It binds 3, which has an  configuration at C5 and is nearly planar, 40­1300 times more tightly than steroids with an sp 2 hybridized C5 (1 and 2) or a  configuration at C5 (4 and 5). This antibody is expected to retain a 1E9-like shape due to the leucine at H47, explaining its ability to bind the hexachloronorbornene derivative (6) 30 times more tightly than 3. In contrast, the LeuH47Trp mutant, which has a 104-fold less favorable Kd for 6, suggesting a significantly remodeled active site, binds 3 roughly an order of magnitude more tightly than progesterone (1) or etiocholanolone (4). These selectivities rival those seen in a related progesterone See also the antibody database Web page: http:// www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/sacs/

beneficial effects on steroid binding in the context of the quadruple mutant, the ArgH100Trp substitution was also tested with LeuH47Trp alone. The binding profile of the resulting Leu H47 Trp/Arg H100 Trp double mutant almost fully mimics the properties of DB3 with respect to ligand affinity and promiscuity (Table 2, Fig. 6). Exchanging these two amino acids suffices to convert 1E9 into a steroid binder with nanomolar affinity for the entire panel of structurally distinct steroids. Based on a doublemutant cycle analysis22 (Fig. 7), these residues, which lie on opposite sides of the binding pocket, affect ligand binding cooperatively. The coupling energy of the two mutations, Gint, provides a measure of non-additivity and varies with the nature of the ligand. Relatively large Gint values are observed for binding of corticosterone (2) (1.5 kcal/mol), 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one (3) (1.4 kcal/ mol), etiocholanolone (4) (1.9 kcal/mol), and the original hapten (6) (0.9 kcal/mol), while cooperativity is less pronounced for progesterone (1) (0.3 kcal/mol) and 5-androstane-3,17-dione (5) (0.5 kcal/mol). Both 1E9 and DB3 derive from a germ line family that is frequently used to bind a large number of haptens, including steroids, small hydrophobic haptens, peptides, proteins, and DNA.12,13 Based on studies of the closely related 39-A11 antibody,23 their progenitors likely possess polyspecific binding sites that were refined in the course of affinity maturation. Utilization of generic hydrophobic binding sites for the initial recognition of diverse sets of ligands has been suggested as a means of significantly expanding the binding potential of the primary antibody repertoire and, in providing good starting points for affinity maturation, facilitating the evolution of tight-binding receptors.23 The distinctive recognition properties of mature DB3 and 1E9 support the notion that such structures can be efficiently tailored to provide high-affinity binders

The coupling free energy is defined as Gint = G1+2 - G1 - G2, where G1, G2, and G1+2 represent the difference in Gibbs free energy for ligand binding to the LeuH47Trp single mutant, the ArgH100Trp single mutant and the LeuH47Trp/ ArgH100Trp double mutant, respectively, compared to wild-type 1E9. With the exception of 5-pregnane-3-ol20-one (3), for which G1 = G2, G1 is approximately 1 kcal/mol more favorable than G2 for all steroid ligands. For compound 6, G1 is 4.5 kcal/mol less favorable than G2.

1000 binding antibody, P15G12C12G11, which was reengineered to minimize cross-reactivity among differently configured steroids.25 A combination of in vitro scanning saturation mutagenesis and error-prone PCR was used to generate a variant with a 20-fold higher affinity for progesterone (1) than for 5- or 5dihydroprogesterone. Our results indicate that a small number of active-site changes can be at least as effective as multiple distant mutations in tailoring steroid recognition. By exploiting a few generic features, such as the hydrogen-bonding potential of AsnH35 and the large non-polar surface of TrpH50 in the context of a large hydrophobic combining site, antibodies like DB3, 1E9, and their homologs23,26 are able to recognize a plethora of structurally distinct chemical compounds. The shape of their conserved pocket can be tailored to a surprisingly high degree through seemingly innocuous point mutations, in much the same way as minimal mutation can dramatically expand the catalytic scope of enzymes.27 Residues that line the active site are particularly important for optimizing shape complementarity to the hapten, although more distant mutations would undoubtedly help to modulate and refine affinity and specificity. By expanding the molecular diversity inherent in the primary antibody repertoire, the plasticity of antibodies derived from polyspecific germ line templates can be expected to enhance the immune system's ability to cope with an essentially limitless variety of haptens.
