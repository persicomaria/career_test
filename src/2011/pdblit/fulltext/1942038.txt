The crystal st,ructure of y-chymotrypsin, the monomeric form of chymotrypsin, has been determined and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of @18 at 1.9 A resolution. The details of the catalytic triad involving Aspl02, His57 and Ser196 agree well with the results found for trypsin (Chambers & Stroud, 1979) and Btrrptomyces griseus protease A (Sielecki et al., 1979). As in many of the other serine proteasrs. the Oy of Serl95 does not appear to be hydrogen-bonded to His57. The three-dimensional structures of y- and I-chymotrypsin (Birktoft & Blow, 1972) are closely similar. The largest backbone differences occur in the "calcium binding loop" (residues 75 to 78) and in the "autolysis loop" (residues 146, 149 and 150). Ala149 and Asnl50 are disordered in y-chymotrypsin, whereas they are stabilized by intermolecular interactions in k-chymotrypsin. The conformation of Ser218 is also different, presumably the indirect result of the dimerie interactions of I-chymotrypsin. These results are discussed in terms of the slow, pH-dependent interconversion of x- and y-chymotrypsin.

1. Introduction
The serine proteases are characterized by the presence of a catalytic triad comprised of Ser195, His57 and Aspl02, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism. To identify completely the configuration of this grouping and to define its mechanism it is necessary to refine crystal structures of these proteins at high resolution. At present, fully refined high-resolution models for these structures are available for only two of these molecules: trypsin (Chambers & Stroud, 1979; Bode & Schwager, 1975a; Bode et al., 1976) and Streptmyces griseus protease A (Sielecki rt al., 1979). We are now able to report the structure of the fully activated chymotrypsin at a comparable level of accuracy ; the report is of the structure of yCHTI-, the cryst]al form that is stable in the pH range of optimum CHT activity.

y-(`HT is a pancreatic serine protease chemically identical to I-(`HT. The two forms are interconvertible by a slo\v. pH-dependent transition ((`orey rt nl.. 1965) and are distinguishahl~ hy t,heir crystallization properties (Kunitz. 193X). y-(`HT crystallizes from ammonium sulfate at, pH .Y;i in the t,etragonal spaw group F'1$,P, while XHT crystallizes from ammonium sulfate at pH 1 in the monoclinic space group P2, Crystals of XHT crack if the pH is raised above 5 and the diffraction pattern at pH 6.7 shows significant changes in intwsity that ha\-cb IMVV~ analysed to demonstrate that st#ructural changes accompany the change in pH (\`andlen & Tulinsky, 1973). Crystals of y-(`HT. on the other hand. are st)ablr from pH 2 to pH 11 (B. W. Matthews. rmpuhlished data). (`HT sh0w.s its maximum activity in t,he pH range 7 to 8. Thus y-(`HT is the crystal form that. may Iw expected t)o represent the conformat'ion of the activcl enzyme. A preliminary report of t.hr crysta,l st'ructure of to@y-(`HT a,t 2.7 A%resolution has been made (Davies et (I/., 1969) and a description of the intSrraction of y-(`HT w&h chloroketow inhil)itJors has twrn published (Segal rf al.. 1971n.6). .I lo\y-rt,sollltion map of y-(`HT has heen report,ed ((`ohen rt (xl.. t 969). and a comparison with I-(`HT at 5.5 A-! resolution revealed t,hat the t\vo molecules npptw-ed to tw wry similar in overall wnformat,ion ((`ohen rot (I/.. 1970). although the crystal packing is quite differentj.

A S5?/0 saturated solution was used to stabilize the crystals after they reached a suitable size ( -0.7 mm). Data to 1.9 A were collected from the native r-CHT crystals on the Picker FAR-1 system using the method described by Sarma et al. (1971). All reflections to 2.5 .!I were measured: beyond 2.5 8. each reflection was initially scanned quickly and only those \vhose intensity exceeded 4 times their standard deviation were remeasured for inclusion in the overall data set. A total of 15,395 reflections was obtained out of 19,650 theoretically possible reflections. Fig. I shows the number of reflections observed as a function of resolution. The various sets of data were corrected for absorption and processed essentially as described before (Cohen et al.. 1969: Sarma et al., 1971).

maps calculated on this assumption revealed no additional sites and there were no anomalies in the least-squares refinement of the 5 independent sites. The mean figure of merit resulting from the refinement is 0.81 for the 6424 reflections beyond 10 A and the final heavy-atom parameters are given in Table 1. A multiple isomorphous replacement map for tosyl-y-CHT was calculated from phases derived from these positions. The location of the 5 independent iodine sites, I to 5 in Table 1, can he interpreted as follows : 1, the excess electron density of the pipsyl iodine atom over the tosyl methyl group; 2 and 4, a pair of iodine atoms covalently bound to Tyr146 as a result of soaking in KI, ; and 3 and 5. a pair of iodine atoms covalently bound to Tyrl71 as a result of soaking in KI,. From the location of the iodine atoms, it can be seen that the side-chain of Tyrl71 is positioned essentially in the same orientation in the iodinated molecule as in the native enzyme. Iodination of Tyr146. however, would result in an unacceptably close contact between an iodine atom and Thr219 Cfl if there were no rearrangement in that region. The positions of these iodine atoms indicate that the side-chain of Tyr146 was displaced by about 1.6 A upon iodination. A Kendrew skeletal model was constructed from the m.i.r. map using an optical comparator (Richards, 1968) without direct reference to the &`HT structure (Matthews et al.. 1968). Atomic positions were measured directly from the wire model. Portions of the model were remeasured when the model idealization program (Diamond, 1966) indicated inconsistency in fitting t,he co-ordinates. The idealized model was adjusted further with the aid of the interactive graphics program MAP (Cohen & Feldmann, unpublished results) to alter sidechain conformations without violating ideal stereochemistry. The resulting crystallographic R-factor was 0476 for the 6238 most intense reflections measured between 10 A and 2.7 A.

The cxonformation for the prolines of thr natirr enzyme was not varied using the real-space refinement program.

main-chain configuration were made evident by non-ideal values for the tetrahedral angle T (the opening between the vectors (14' and Cl-Ii), which varied considerably from I IO" After rebuilding, with particular attention to these regions, further fitting to the m.i.r. map yielded R = W383. Subsequent. real-space refinement utilized 2F, - F, Fourier maps phased on the model coordinates : a new map was calculated every 2nd or 3rd pass. The parametric weights used in this procedure are displayed in Table 2. Following the first rebuilding of the model. atomic occupancies were not refined, so that atoms incorrectly placed would be more likely to be moved by the procedures. Model rebuilding was done on the graphics terminal referring to both the difference and 2F,F, Fourier maps. Following each rebuilding, the model was rrstJorrd to ideal geometry (Diamond, 1966) before proceeding. The final tosyl-y-CHT model (R = @312), after removing the co-ordinates of the tosyl group at Serl95, was then used as a starting model for the I.9 .q native enzyme refinement.

Krfinrment of the native y-CHT model was carried out in 3 distinct stages. Initially. the real-space refinement procedure described above for tosyl-y-CHT, but using native model phases, was applied to the model. The parameters used are included in Table 2. This resulted in R = 0323 for 15,240 data from I@0 A to 1.9 A. The next stagr of refinement was accomplished by means of the differential difference Fourier method (Quarashi, 1949; Cochran, 19.51). Occupancies at solvent positions u-ere refined by comparison of observed versus calculated peak heights at the atomic centers. Temperature factor refinement was introduced by the method of Cruickshank (1956) using second drrivativrs of the differential syntheses. The model was periodically idealized by a version of the REFINE2 program of Hermans 8r McQueen (1974).

In the final stage of refinement we used the restrained least-squares procedure of Hendrickson & Konnert (1981) as implemented by Wayne Hendrickson at the Naval Research Laboratory. Reflection data for d > 7.0 A were omitted, leaving 14,974 data to 1.9 A. The reflections from 10 A to 7 a were removed because of the poorer agreement in that range of resolution that was causing unrealistically low temperature factors. The R-factor of the model from the differential difference Fourier procedure increased to 0262 after the removal of individual temperature factors. After 6 cycles of least-squares refinement (parameter weights and shifts used are given in Table 3) the R value converged to 0.199.

We distinguish between the 1-4 contacts and the other contacts because the) behaved differently in the refinement. 1 In the series 1 model. the plane defining the peptide link restrained the main-chain angles w. In series 2, this restraint was altered. Thus the superior value exhibited by the series 2 final model may not be vompared with the result of the series 1 model. LVhen the peptide link was redefined, the weight for planar angles (w, x5) was also altered.

Examination of Fourier maps at this time resulted in the placement of residues 9 and 10 of the A-chain where several water molecules had previously been positioned. Residues 149 and 150 of the C-chain were removed upon noting that their density was poorly defined and that the conformation assigned to them was improbable because of contacts with neighboring residues. A number of previously assigned water molecules were removed and additional ones were placed. This rebuilding and map examination were accomplished using the interactive graphics program BILDER of Diamond (1981) as well as a "mini-map" (1 .i = 0.4 cm) showing the model superimposed on 2F,- F, and AF maps. r\ final set of least-squares refinement began with R = 6221 and effectively converged at R = (rIgI after 7 cycles.

Computational

procrdlms

Computer programs to handle the collection of data, data reduction and phase determination have been described elsewhere (Cohen et al., 1969: Sarma et al., 1971). Structure factors were generated by a procedure suggested by Kollett (1965), which generates the contribution of each atom to every structure factor before going to a subsequent atom, a procedure similar to that described by Burnett & Nordman (1974). In order to accomplish this within the constraints of a PDP 1 l/70 mini-computer, the program was organized to interleave paging of atomic co-ordinates and structure factors while writing partial summations onto a direct access file. Programs to carry out the differential difference Fourier procedures were written along the same principles as the structure factor programs, calculating the slopes and curvatures at current atomic positions. By evaluating slopes and curvatures directly at atomic centers, the procedure was more efficient than calculating the various required conventional Fourier summations over a minimum of 200 times as many grid points to be followed hy the need to interpolate in the resulting maps. The curvatures were estimated from the average curvature found in a differential F, synthesis, using only those sites showing positive density and all 3 curvatures negative. Experience showed that it was unnecessary to determine the curvatures more than once. For the application of the temperature factor shifts, it was necessary to calculate the derivatives with respect to temperature factor of the curvatures in an F, synthesis only once. An average value was used based on similar criteria as for the positional curvatures. The program BlLDER (Diamond, 1981) required significant modifications to enable its operation on a PDP 1 I/70 under the RSX-I I M operating system. BILDER was developed under the DOS operating system, in which the user may exercise rather liberal control over the mapping registers, effectively extending the core size available to the program. As the program code and general array space occupy approximately 28 Kw (1 Kw = 1024 16.bit words) of the maximum permitted 32 Kw of address space and an additional 16 Kw of map vector display space is required, an analogous facility in the RSX-I 1 M operating system must be found. This is accomplished by using executive calls, a process that entails significantly more overhead, both in the code and in its run-time characteristics. Our version contained 32 Kw of map vector space. Other aspects of the use of our version of BILDER are described elsewhere (Bott et al., unpublished data). The model of refined y-CHT has 1850 atoms with 3 positional variables and 1 temperature factor for each atom. With only 15,000 structure-factor observations to 1.9 A, the problem is overdetermined insufficiently for a least-squares refinement when the atoms are considered as an unlinked set. The procedure of Hendrickson & Konnert (1981) alters the model to represent a set of linked atoms by the introduction of geometric restraints (Sielecki et al., 1979), leading to a model that represents consideration of structure-factor information and a set of stereochemical restraints. The weights used for the various measures of stereochemistry and the final values achieved in the model are summarized in Table 3. The superposition of y-CHT upon various other serine protease structures was carried out with a version of COMPARE (Hermans, personal communication) modified by us to use t,he

algorithms of AMcLachlan (1972) to accomplish the fitting. A filtering procedure was used to exclude the atoms that showed gross differences. Aft,er each least-squares determination of the orientation, the atoms that exhibited a mismat,ch of greater than 3 times the root-meansquare mismatch were removed from consideration. The procedure was repeated until no additional atoms were rejected. Co-ordinates for the comparisons were acquired from the Protein Structure Data Bank (Bernstein it al., 1977). The native 4HT co-ordinates were those reported by Birktoft 8 Blow (1972), including the modifications for His57 and Ser195 according to Henderson (1970). The native elastase co-ordinates were those given by Sawyer et a,l. (1978). The diptrypsin co-ordinates were those given by Chambers & Stroud (1979).

3. Results
The refined atomic co-ordinates and temperature factors have been deposited in the Protein Structure Data Bank maintained at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The three-dimensional structure of y-CHT (Fig. 3) closely resembles that of ,I-CHT (Birktoft & Blow, 1972). The largest differences are found in surface residues and will be described later. Allowing for differences in interpretation and taking into account that the 2-CHT molecule has not been refined extensively and represents an average of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the overall structure and main-chain hydrogen-bonding scheme in y-CHT (Fig. 4) is essentially identical to that reported for I-CHT. In the restrained least-syuares procedure used, it is difficult to define the standard deviation of an atomic position because of the manner in which the atoms are linked. Luzzati (1952) has provided a means to estimate the mean co-ordinate error (dr) in the molecule by plotting the R-factor against resolution. From such a plot (Fig. ?5) we can estimate that Ar is approximately @2 a for the refined y-CHT

Residues 149, 150 and 11 to 13 are disordered in y-CHT and are not shown in the Figure.

As noted in the Table, some of t,he hydrogen bonds, lvhich were identified as long in NHT but M`IY~ included as possible hydrogen bonds by Birktoft 8r Blow (1972) because they were stereochemically reasonable, were not identified as hydrogen bonds for y-CHI Ijrcause t,he atoms were separated by more than 3-5 A. The differences in the hydrogen-I)orldit~g schemes of y-CHT and r-CHT occur in bends and helical regions \vhere flexibility may be expected. The nature of the helical structure is very similar in y-("HT and NHT. except at the end of t'he (`-terminal helix. In y-(`HT. residues 234 to 245 form bhree turns of distorted l-helix.

The disulfide bridge between (`ysl and (`~~122 is oriented differently in y-(`HT and I-(`HT, resulting in a slightly altered position for the (`% of Cysl However. this difference does not appear t,o alter the other interactions between the A-chain and t,he rest of the molecule. The other four disulfide bridges have the samt' conformation in the two structures, as has been observed for the four disulfide linkages common to elastase and NHT (Sawyer it al., 1978). The relevant dihedral angles for all five bridges are listed in Table 6.

Our model for the crystal structurtb of y-CHT contains 151 solvent positions. Sone of the solvent peaks was large enough to merit assignment as a sulfate ion and so they wilt henceforth be referred t,o as water molecules. Thirteen of these water molecules are buried in the interior of the protein : S304, S306, 5307. S309. S312: S314, S317, S322, 5323. S328, S337, S381 and S406.

cylinder 1.5314,8328 and 8406 are on the surface of cylinder 2. in the Ilel6 pocket. and the six remaining buried solvent molecules lie in the interface bet,ween cylinder 1 and cylinder 2. In the vicinit'y of the salt-bridge between Ilel6 and Asp194 (Fig. 9) there are five water molecules: S406. S328, 8304, 8309 and 8314. These interact with each other and with the surrounding residues and their juxtaposition to the ion pair suggests that t'hey might, play a role in dissipating the charge of the ion pair.

In tosyl-y-(`HT. the tosyl ring occupies the specificity pocket defined by residues 189 to 195, 214 to 220 and 225 to 228 (Fig. 10). It is covalently bound to Serl9.5 Oy. In the native enzyme, as has been observed in SGPA (Sielecki et al., 1979) and in Tulinsky's determination of the structure of native I-CHT (personal communication), the pocket contains water molecules (Fig. 11). In y-CHT these water molecules are hydrogen-bonded either directly t,o t,he protein or indirectly through

In y-(`HT, Asp102 OS1 and His57 NSl form a good hydrogen bond: the atoms are only 2.8 ?I apart with the Asp102 OS1 only 0.2 L~ out of the plane of the imidazole ring. Holvevrr. the Serl9.5 Oy to His57 Ne2 distance (3-8 x) is larger in y-CHT than in the other serinr proteases (Table 7). In addition. Serl95 Oy is @7 A4 out of the plane of the imidazole ring and, for t>hese reasons, we regard this as an improbable candidate for a hydrogen bond. The other hydrogen bonds formed by the activeventer residues in y-CHT are Asp102 OS1 to Ser214 Oy (25 A), Asp102 OS2 to His57 S (2.9 A) and AisplO2 OS2 to Uly56 S (2% a). No hydrogen bond is formed between Asp102 OS2 and His57 X61 ; the atoms are 3.4 A apart with the Asp102 OS2 1.0 ,A out of t#he plane of the imidazole ring.

After the removal of the atoms that showed the largest differences from the comparison. the 1604 atoms remaining gave an r.m.s. separation of 0.7 8.

which is substantially in agreement with that found previously from comparison of the electron density maps (Matthews et al., 1968; Cohen et al., 1969). The rejected backbone atoms (Table 8) are found in external residues forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds in at least one of the crystals. Residues 75 to 78 are in the calciumbinding loop (Bode & Schwager, 197%), which is a part of an intermolecular contact surface in +HT. Tyr146, the C-terminal residue in the B-chain, forms intermokacular contacts in both proteins, while Asnl.51, the first ordered residue in t,he C-chain of +HT, forms intermolecular contacts in wCHT only. The largest differences in the orientation of the side-chains are found in Asn245, the (`l-terminal residue of the C-chain, and in Lys36 and Ser77, which both lie on an intermolecular contact surface in y-(`HT. The rejected side-chain atoms are external with the exception of the several valine and leucine residues whose orientations appear to have been interpreted differently in the two crystals. A superposition of the active-center residues in native y-CHT and native r-CHT (Henderson. 1970: Birktoft & Blow, 1972) is shown in Figure 13. As noted previously by Matt,hews et al. (1977), using preliminary co-ordinates for y-CHT, the most striking difference in this region is the downward rotation of the Ser195 Oy about thr C"-(`/3 bond in y-CHT (x1 = -44") as compared with its upward orientat'ion in I-C'HT (x1 = +93"), resulting in a 1.6 b, separation of the Ser195 Oy at'oms in the superimposed structures. It should be noted, however, that Raghavan B Tulinsky (1979) do not agree with Birktoft & Blow (t972), and have observed the donnlvard orientation for Oy in their analysis of the native I-CHT structure at 1.8 A&; however, their full co-ordinat#e set is not yet available for our study. In %(`HT t,he imidazolr ring is slightly twisted and tilted downward with respect to its position in y-(`HT, producing a 0.1 A to 0.5 a separation between corresponding ring atoms. Serl95 Oy and His.57 Nc2 are too far apart (3% w) in y-CHT to form a hydrogen bond: moreover, Ser195 Oy is 0.7 w out of the plane of the imidazole ring.

The intermolecular contacts are not the same in y-CHT and I-CHT. In y-CHT there are two surfaces of direct intermolecular contact. The first is an interaction about the crystallographic 4, axis. As seen in Figure 14, the amino group of Lys90 forms a hydrogen bond with both the Asp64 061 (2.7 A) and the (:I$59 0 (2.95 A) of the neighboring molecule. A hydrogen bond is also formed between Phedl 0 and Ser96 Oy (3.3 A) of the adjacent molecule. As seen in the Figure, the active-center residues are not obstructed by the intermolecular contacts. Further along t'hc & axis an intermolecular hydrogen bond is formed between Tyr146 07 and Lysl7.i NC (2.7 .A). The same general surface that interacts about the 1, axis in y-(`HT interacts about the local dyad "A" (Birktoft & Blo\v. 1972) in `r-(`HT (Fig. 15). In this case the contact surface between neighboring molecules is more extensive and involves interactions nith active-center residues (His57 WTyr146 0. His57 ObAsnlSO N62, His57 N<2-Tyr146 0, Ser214 0-Tyr146 07). Gly59 0 and Asp64 061, which interact with Lys90 NC in y-CHT, interact with the amino end of Ala149 in I-CHT.

used because of the many sequence differences. Also, insertions and deletions in sequence prevented the inclusion of all the residues. The initial comparison with dip-trypsin began with the common 860 backbone atoms based on sequence. The final r.m.s. separation, using the filtering procedure described above, was I.0 !I for 785 atoms. In the comparison of benzamidinetrypsin and I-CHT (Huber et&., 1974), residues that were near insertions OI deletions were omitted, leaving 169 residues for comparison. The 169 residues (16 to 33,39to58,69to71,79to 124,133to 142,152to 153,189to201,211 to216and225 to 245) selected on this basis were used in a further comparison of y-CHT and diptrypsin and gave an r.m.s. separation of 0.7 A%for 670 atoms. Initially the comparison of y-CHT and rlastase was made with the common 900 backbone atoms giving an r.m.s. separation of 1 .l L& for 854 atoms. Of the 169 residues selected by Huber et al. (1974). 156 are present in elastase : 16 to 33, 39 to 58,69 to 71, 79 to 94, 102 to 124, 133 to 142, 152 to 168. 173 to 183, 191 to 201.211 to 216 and 225 to 245. A comparison beginning with these 624 backbone atoms resulted in an r.m.s. separation of 0.8 A4 for 615 atoms. The relative orientation of the active-center residues of y-CHT and dip-trypsin as determined by the least-squares superposition of the 670 selected backbone atoms is shown in Figure 16. The structural differences between y-CHT and dip-trypsin in the active-center region are smaller than those between y-CHT and I-CHT. The Rer195 Oy in dip-trypsin is in the downward position (x1 = - 77"). as it is in y-OHT (x1 = -44") with a @6 A4 separation of the superimposed Oy atoms. The His57 imidazole rings are essentially coplanar, but corresponding atoms are separated by a translation ranging from 02 w for the X61 atoms to 0.4 A4 for the Xc2 atoms. Whereas in y-CHT a potential hydrogen bond between Ser19.5 C)y and His57 Ne2 would be weak (3.8 A), in dip-trypsin these atoms are close enough (3.1 -4) to form a good hydrogen bond. However, in both proteins, the Ser19.5 Oy is @7 A out of the plane of the imidazole ring, so that in either case a potential hydrogen bond would be distorted. The differences in the conformations of Asp102 of the two molecules are small. The displacement of the 061 atom is compensated by a corresponding shift in the His57 N61 atom so that, in both proteins, the Asp102 061 and His67 961 atoms are

Whereas these atoms are clcw~ enough to form a hydrogen bond in dip-trypsin (3.1 A ), they are 3.8 A apart in y-CHT and do not appear to form a hydrogen bond.

close enough to form a strong hydrogen bond: 2.6 A in dip-trypsin and 2.8 A in y(`HT. Moreover. the displacement of Asp102 061 out of the plane of the imidazole ring is only 93 A in dip-trypsin and 0.2 A in y-CHT. The other three hydrogen bonds formed by the Asp102 side-chain in y-CHT are also formed in dip-trypsin. The positions of the amido nitrogens of Gly193 and Ser195, which form the oxyanion hole (Robertus et al., 1972), are not significantly different in y-CHT and dip-trypsin.

The y-CHT water molecules were compared with the 50 t-(:HT water molecules. the 80 dip-trypsin water molecules and the 46 elastase water molecules to determine which occupied structurally equivalent positions. In each case the t,ransformation that superimposed the protein on y-(`HT was applied to the water molecules associated with that protein. and those that transformed to tvithin 1.6 A4 of a y-C'HT water molecule were considered to be in equivalent positions. The results are shown in Table 9. Twenty-tao water molecules occupy eyuivalent positions in y-CHT and in A'HT. Seven occupy equivalent positions in all four structures: 8302, 8304. 8309. S312, S317. S323 and S3Xl (Fig. 17): S302 lies in a crevice on the surface, binding to Val210 and Thr232, thus linking the ends of t,hc loop extending between them. The other six hare been described abovta.

4. Discussion
The pancreatic serine proteases. chymotrypsin. trypsin and elastase, are closel,v homologous in primary structure (Walsh & Seurabh. 1964: Shotton & Hartley, 1970) and in tertiary structure: the microbial serine proteases, SGPA, SGPB and Ylytic protease, while showing much less sequence homology (James rt al.. 1978) with the other serine proteases. nevertheless. have a similar three-dimensional structure (Sielecki et al.. 1979; Delbaere et al.. 1979: Brayer et al.. 1979). On the other hand, subtilisin. another bacterial serine protease, is not homologous with the above serine proteases in either sequence or tertiary structure (Wright, et al., 1969). All of these enzymes. however. have closely similar active-site conformations. In particular. the catalytic triad consisting of 8er19.5. His57 and Asp102 is found in the same geometrical conformation, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism. Blow et al. (1969) presented a structure for #I-CHT at, 2 19 resolution. which showed that Serl95 Oy and Asp102 061 were both within hydrogen-bonding distance of His.57 NED and His57 X81. respectively. although they did not lie in the plane of the imidazole ring. This description of the catalytic triad led to their proposal of a "charge-relay" system, in which electrons could be transferred from the buried Asp102 to the surface residue Kerl95, increasing the nucleophilicity of

Scrl9.5 0~. This highly reactive side-chain could then attack the carbonyl atom of the scissile peptide bond, forming an acyl enzyme. They proposed further the transfer of the Ser195 Oy proton to the leaving group in the acylation step, possibly t)hrough the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. In the deacylation step. a water molecule replaces the leaving group with the proton transfer again being facilitated by the charge-relay system. Our results show that,, while a good hydrogen bond is formed between Asp102 061 and His57 N61, the hydrogen bond between Ser195 Oy and His57 Nc2 is unlikely. This is consistent with the geometry of the catalytic triad found in the t,wo other refined, high-resolution structures : trypsin (Chambers & Stroud, 1979 : Bode & Schwager, 1975a; Bode & al.. 1976) and SPA (Sielecki rt al.. 1979). The trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PTT) complex has been proposed by Huber & Bode (1978) to be an intermediate along the pathway to the tetrahedral intermediate t.ransition state of the enzyme. In this complex. the carbonyl carbon of Lvsl5 of the "substrate" is distorted so that it lies halfway between a trigonal and a tetrahedral configuration and a "perfectly linear" hydrogen bond is formed i)rt,ween Serl95 Oy and His57 Nc2. They attribute the formation of this hydrogen bond to a movement of Ser195 caused by the binding of the substrate. Xnhydrotrypsin (in which Serl95 has been converted to a dehydroalanine) binds PTl almost as strongly as native trypsin (Vincent rt al., 1974). The pyramidalization of the PTI Lysl5 carbonyl carbon atom in the anhydrotrypsinI'TT complex is identical to that of the trypsin-PTI complex (Huber et al.. 1975). leading to the suggestion that the tetrahedral distortion of the carbonyl carbon atom in the substrate is induced by the interaction of the substrate with the enzyme. particularly with Ser195 S and Glyl93 K of the oxyanion hole (Huber & Bode. 1978), and not by a secondary effect involving the side-chain of Ser195. Our findings. that, no hydrogen bond is formed between Ser195 Oy and His57 NED in the native y-(`HT st#ructure at pH 5.5 and that the oxyanion hole is of acceptable geometry. are consistent with their hypothesis. #HT and I-(`HT are chemically identical conformers ((:orbunoff et al.. 1978) of fully activated (`HT. A slow. pH-dependent. interconversion between the two has brt~ demonstrat)ed : first. by Corey et al. (1965) in t,heir study of the crystallizatjiorl of the t\vo forms and, since then. by the various solution studies noted belo\v. (`onversion of (`HT to t.-CHT occurs at low pH ( -4). while y-(`HT occurs at hight.1, pH intsluding thtl range of optimum CHT activity. I-CHT has been shown to dimrrizr readily at low pH ~ reaching its maximum dimer to monomer ratio at pH 4. while y-(`HT exhibits a considerably weaker effect under the same conditions (Aunr B Timasheff. 1971 : Gorbunoff et al., 1978: Miller Pt al., 1971). The rate of drnaturation at pH 7.2 in 8 M-urea of y-(`HT and &`HT has bee11 studied by A1very Q Hopkins (1973). who found that y-(`HT unfolds at about twiw t,he rat,? of MHT. In the case of YC'HT it is not, clear whether the monomer or t,he dimrr is the species present. In a similar experiment by Sharma & Hopkins (1978). involving thr pH-dependent interconversion of inhibited ~1 -CHT and K-(*HT. in which the dipeptide Thr147-Asn148 has not yet been cleaved from the beginning of the (`-chain. the interconversion from K-CHT to ~1.(`HT u'as shown t,o take several hours and the reverse int'erconvrrsion to take several days.

(197 I ) have shown that the slowly unfolding member of this pair, K-("HT, which is the analogous member to ,I-CHT in the 1-y pair, is not a dimer, suggesting that it is reasonable that the monomer of #HT may exist at pH 7.2. The mechanism of acid dimerization of A"HT has been studied by chemical modification and it has been established that His57 and Tyr146 are key residues in the intermolecular interaction. Photo-oxidation (Egan et al., 1957) or methplation (Gorbunoff rt al., 1978) of His57 eliminates the acid dimerization of CHT : removal of Tyr146 (Gladner & Neurath. 1954) has the same effect. To establish which functional groups are involved in the interact,ion, (:orbunoff et al. (1978) made several modifications to Tyr146 and found that, while acetylation of the phenolic hydroxyl merely reduces dimerization. blocking the carboxyl group effectively eliminates dimerization of &HT. These results are consistent with the intermolecular interactions observed in the crystal structures of tosyl-r-CHT (Birkt,oft Ki Blow. 1972) and for native MHT (Vandlen $ Tulinskg, 1973) and identify the non-crystallographic dpad "A" observed in these structures as the axis of dimerization. The specific feature found in the crystal structure determinations that corresponds to the observations from solution studies is either (1) a hydrogen bond between the protonated carbonyl group of Tyrl46 and the His.57 carbonyl oxygen or (2) an ionic interaction bet'ween the ionized carboxylate of Tyrl46 and the His57 imidazolium ion. It is of interest. therefore, t'o see whether the differences in properties between y(`HT and l-(rHT can be accounted for by differences in their conformations. In tnaking this comparison, one must remember that the structure of S~-(`HT has not, been refined completely and, consequently, significant, errors may still be expected. The differences discussed here, however. are large differences that are expected to survive any refinement of S~-VHT. The largest conformational differences in the protein folding occur in the calcium-binding loop and in the autolysis loop. Residues 75 to 7X. which are part of the external calcium-binding loop, show a large difference in conformation of the main chain between y-C"HT and I-(JHT: however, bhis region is not well-defined in either structure. Moreover, it is not involved in the dimer interactions in I-(`HT and differences in its conformation are probably the result, of intermolecular packing. It seems unlikely that the conformation of this loop would have any effect on the ability of -\-C'HT to dimerize. In CHT, there is a break in the autolysis loop as a result of the excision of residues 147 and 148. In &HT. Ala149 and Xsnl50 are engaged in the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds near the dimrr interface. While Asnl50 also forms intramolecula,r hydrogen bonds with Argl45 and Thrl44 in XHT. this intramolecular interaction does not, appear sufficient to stabilize residues 149 and 150 in y-CHT. Superposition of Tyr146 in the two structures (Fig. 18). however. shows significant differences in the conformation of that) residue. The planes of both the carboxylate group and the phenyl ring have very different, orientations and large displacements are found at other atomic positions: S (0% a), C':2 (2.0 A), (' (1.7 A). Were the conformation of Tyrl46 in T-CHT like that in y-CHT. unacceptably close contacts would result between the carboxylate of the tyrosine of one molecule and both the carbonyl oxygen (1.7 a) and the side-chain (vin (32. 2.2 .A) of His57 of the other molecule. It should be noted. however. that there is no

Molecule 1 is represented by small open circles and molecule 2 by small closed circles. y-CHT residues (large open circles) are superimposed on molecule 2 of I-C'HT. A large difference in the conformation of Tyrl46 can be seen, as well as smaller differences in the neighboring residues. In a-CHT, the following intermolecular interact,ions (indicated in the Figure by thin lines) between t,he Tyrl46 carboxyl group and His57 are possible: Tgr146 02-His57 0 and Tyr14H O,-His57 X62. The orientation of Tyrl4ti in y-(`HT does not permit these interactions. Moreover. the carboxyl group of Tyr146 forms unacceptably close contacts with His57 0 (1.7 a). A c~onformational change of Tyrl46 would be required for y-CHT to dimerize in the manner of a-CHT. Also shown in the Figure are the intermolecular hydrogen bonds which Tyr146 07 forms in r-(`HT (Tyrl46 OT-SrrZll 0) and in +?HT (Tyrl46 017-Lys175 St).

significant difference in the orientation of His57 in the two molecules. On the other hand, were the conformation of Tyr146 in a-C'HT to be superimposed on the framework of the y-CHT molecule, a close contact (2.4 is) would be found between Tyrl45 Ccl and Ser218 0. This tight fit is accommodated in I-CIHT by a movement of 1.0 AA in the position of Ser218 relative to its position in y-CHT. Our attempts to model this conformational change using t,he interactive graphics program BILDER have convinced us that no significant energy barrier exists for the rearrangement of the end of the B-chain in order to reorient the tyrosine residue: the modifications necessary to rearrange the backbone conformation in the vicinity of residue 218 are somewhat more difficult to assess. Thus, while y-CHT and I-CHT show conformational differences in the residues that participate in the dimeric interactions in r-CHT, the energy barriers between these conformations do not appear to be sufficiently large to explain the difference in their ability to dimerize. We find no conformational difference that could prevent a rapid interconversion between y-CHT and n-CHT as monomers. Finally. it is of interest to note that the serine proteases contain an unusualI) largr number of internal water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded to the protein. We have determined that the positions of seven of the 13 internal water molecules in y-CHT are common sites for waters in each of a-CHT. dip-trypsin and elastasr. Moreover, Sieleeki ut nl. (1979) found an internal water molecule in SUPA (02-U) to be structurally invariant in `2*-CHT and benzamidine-trypsin (Bode & Schwagrr, 197%). and suggested that this was a "conserved" w;tter molecule.

This water molecule. which is in the vicinity of the IlrlA~Asp194 ion pair and apparently delocalizes the charge of t,he buried Asp194 (Fig:. 9), seems to be an integral part' of the serine protease structure. It, will be interesting to see from further comparisons of the water positions in the serine prot,eases whether any of the other six water molecules, which we found to be common to the pancreatic serinr proteases, are also conserved in the bacterial serine proteases. The hospitality of W. Hendrickson and his colleagues at the Laboratory for the Structurr of Matter of the Naval Research Laboratory is appreciated. His advice on the use of tht, restrained least-squares method was extremely valuable. .4 number of the Figures used in this report were prepared by a computer program written by H. Saroff. The Figures of molecular models were prepared using t)he program ORTEP of C. K. *Johnson. The authors thank members of this laboratory for their critical review of the manuscript,: R. Bott. (:. Gilleland and M. Navia were particularly helpful with their comments.
