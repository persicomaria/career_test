Copper amine oxidase: cunning cofactor and controversial copper Helen C Dawkes and Simon EV Phillips*
Copper amine oxidases have a complex reaction cycle that converts a primary amine and molecular oxygen into the aldehyde, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. Coupling structural studies of freeze-trapped reaction intermediates in crystals with kinetic and spectroscopic experiments in solution has generated a detailed molecular picture of catalysis. Although dioxygen has been directly observed bound to the copper at a late stage in the reaction cycle, whether copper is the initial binding site remains controversial.

Following this initial activation, the enzyme is able to catalyse reaction (1) via ping-pong kinetics with the following half reactions: Eox + R-CH2NH3+  Ered + O2  Ered + R-CHO (3) (4)

Eox + NH4+ + H2O2

In the reductive half reaction (3), the enzyme binds the amine substrate, is reduced by two electrons and releases the aldehyde product, whereas in the oxidative half reaction (4), molecular oxygen is converted to hydrogen peroxide with release of ammonia, regenerating the oxidised enzyme. In addition to the copper, the active site in Eox contains a redox cofactor, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ; Figure 1) [8], formed by post-translational modification of a conserved tyrosine residue in the sequence TXXNY(D/E), one of only 19 residues conserved across all 25 known CuAO sequences. The active site of Eox therefore has the capacity, in principle, to be reduced by up to three electrons, one to reduce CuII to CuI, and two more to reduce TPQ to trihydroxyphenylalanine (TPQred). As free copper is rare in cells, its concentration in the cytoplasm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae having recently been shown to be <10­18 M (less than one atom per cell) [9], its use in an enzyme suggests a very specific role. It had been widely assumed that CuI would be present in Ered as the site of oxygen binding, as this is its function in other copper-containing proteins that bind oxygen [10]. It is now not certain this is the case and whether the copper is indeed the binding site for molecular oxygen in CuAO has become a focus of research in the field.

Introduction
Copper amine oxidases (CuAOs; EC 1.4.3.6) are found in bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals [1]. They have various biological roles, ranging from nutrient metabolism in prokaryotes to less well defined involvement in signalling and development in higher organisms. CuAOs are dimers of identical 70­95 kDa subunits, each subunit containing a single copper. They catalyse the twoelectron oxidation of primary amines, using molecular oxygen to reoxidise the enzyme, according to the overall reaction [2]: R-CH2NH3+ + O2 + H2O  R-CHO + NH4+ + H2O2 (1) They belong to a wider class of copper proteins that bind and activate dioxygen [3,4]. In fact, the situation is more complex than Equation 1 suggests and CuAO catalyses two different reactions. The first is an autocatalytic single turnover that requires only copper and molecular oxygen. It generates the active, oxidised enzyme Eox in a six-electron oxidation from the precursor protein P, which contains no copper or redox cofactor [5­7]:

Structure of amine oxidase
The crystal structure was originally solved for the Escherichia coli enzyme (ECAO) at 2 Å resolution in 1995 [11,12·] and subsequently for the pea seedling (PSAO) [13], Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO) [14] and Hansenula polymorpha (HPAO) enzymes [15]. The dimer has an overall mushroom shape with four domains (Figure 2). The function of the first three + domains is not clear. Domain 1 forms the stalk, but is not present in all species, and domains 2 and 3 lie at the periphery, although domain 3 does contribute to the amine substrate entrance/exit channel. The all- domain 4, consisting of the 440 C-terminal residues, forms the subunit interface and contains the deeply buried active site with copper and TPQ. In active ECAO, crystallised at the optimum pH for activity (pH 7.2), the copper has approximate square pyramidal coordination, with four equatorial ligands -- His524,

His526, His689, water We -- and an axial water molecule, Wa (Figure 3). We is labile, being observed in the original ECAO structure [11], but not in the low-temperature structure [12·] and in only five of the six crystallographically independent active sites in HPAO [15]. TPQ (residue 466) lies near, but not coordinated to, the copper, with O2 hydrogen bonded to Wa and O5 positioned close to the conserved active site base Asp383 (the `off-copper' conformation). O4 forms a short hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl of conserved Tyr369. A substrate entry channel leads from TPQ O5 to the enzyme surface, as shown by the structure of the suicide inhibitor 2-hydrazinopyridine (2-HP) in complex with ECAO [16], with Tyr381 acting as a gate at the entrance. TPQ is quite mobile and can flip around 2 so that O5 points towards the copper. It can also swing around 1 to contact the copper directly (`on-copper' conformation), as observed in the ammonium-sulfate-inactivated form [11], in which the copper is tetrahedrally coordinated by O4 of TPQ and the three histidines. The active sites of the other CuAOs are highly conserved, with conformational differences between different forms mainly limited to TPQ mobility and position. The CuAO catalytic mechanism has been extensively studied by a variety of kinetic and spectroscopic techniques, and recently by structural and functional studies of site-directed mutant variants of ECAO, AGAO and HPAO. ECAO crystals are catalytically competent, with the active sites accessible to substrates, but buried away from, and apparently not sensitive to, crystal contacts. They diffract X-rays strongly and good visible spectra can be measured from frozen crystals. This has stimulated attempts to map the various steps in the reaction by cryogenically trapping reaction intermediates in the crystal and determining their structures [17··]. Many mechanistic studies have used bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO), for instance, the original identification of TPQ [8], experiments questioning of the role of CuI [18] and a recent kinetic study of the overall reaction [19]. The lentil enzyme (LSAO) has also been a target [20], but both BSAO and LSAO are less tractable than ECAO for protein engineering and lack known crystal structures.

to CuI, quickly forming a CuII­superoxide complex that P attacks the ring to form the first carbonyl at C5 (P3). The ring then flips and C2 undergoes nucleophilic attack by an P axial hydroxyl on the copper (P4). The final oxidation to the C2 carbonyl is completed with the conversion of a second molecule of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The structure of the starting copper-free apoenzyme of AGAO [14] shows Tyr382 (Tyr466 in ECAO) in the `on-copper' conformation, giving an empty tetrahedral copper site. This is shown as P in Figure 5, together with the known structures corresponding to other reaction intermediates or their mimics. A recent study measured the stoichiometry of this six-electron oxidation as the consumption of two moles of oxygen for the production of one mole each of hydrogen peroxide and TPQ [25·]. The rate of hydrogen peroxide production is first order, consistent with the proposed mechanism. Spectroscopic and kinetic studies of wild-type and mutant variants of HPAO [26,27], whereby copper was first bound anaerobically and then oxygen admitted to generate TPQ, suggested modifications to this mechanism. Mutations in the histidine ligands to the copper were shown to support TPQ biogenesis only if copper binding was retained. Changes in kinetics resulting from mutations of Asn404 and Glu406 (465 and 467 in ECAO), which flank TPQ in the conserved TXXNYD/E sequence, were also analysed. The lack of effect of NO on biogenesis was proposed to rule out a tyrosine radical species and, therefore, CuI as the intermediate required for oxygen binding [27]. Oxygen was therefore suggested to bind to the enzyme at a site distinct from the copper, stimulate the movement of Tyr405 (466 in ECAO) from an `off-copper' to `on-copper' conformation, and then react with the CuII­tyrosinate complex. The latter reaction would be the rate-determining step [27]. The lack of involvement of CuI in oxygen binding has also been proposed for the oxidative half reaction [18] (see below) and has been a topic of debate in the field. As substitution of the metal by NiII, ZnII or CoII disables biogenesis, the copper clearly has a special role in activating the oxygen. The

TPQ biogenesis
A number of novel cofactors formed by post-translational modifications of amino acid sidechains have been identified for various enzymes in the past decade [7,21­23]. All CuAOs appear to contain TPQ, apart from lysyltyrosine quinone (LTQ) in lysyl oxidase. A claim for a third variety of cofactor in Aspergillus niger amine oxidase (ANAO) has been recently refuted [24]. TPQ biogenesis requires only the presence of copper and oxygen [5,6], and several mechanisms have been proposed, including one based primarily on structural data [14] and shown in Figure 4. In this mechanism, the tyrosine (Tyr466 in ECAO) coordinates CuII (in the `on-copper' arrangement seen for TPQ in inactivated AGAO and ECAO), forming a CuI­tyrosine P radical complex (P2 in Figure 4). Molecular oxygen binds

In a study of the inhibitory effect of adding azide before oxygen on the biogenesis of TPQ in HPAO, it was suggested that azide binds to form a tetrahedral copper complex and its displacement by Tyr405 becomes the rate-determining step [29].

Reductive half reaction
The mechanism for the reductive half reaction (3) is now well established and relatively uncontroversial (Figure 4). Substrate amine initially forms a Schiff base with TPQ O5 2 (2 in Figure 4). Hydrogen abstraction from substrate C­H by the active site base (Asp383 in ECAO) leads to rearrangement to the product Schiff base, followed by hydrolysis to release the aldehyde product. An earlier

Catalysis and regulation

crystallographic study of the suicide inhibitor 2-HP complex is consistent with this mechanism and provided a structural model for the substrate Schiff base intermediate 2 (2 in Figure 5) [16]. Recent studies of mechanism-based diamine inhibitors show they modify residues along the substrate entry channel and so would not provide good models for intermediates in the mechanism [30,31]. In the substrate-reduced form of the enzyme, TPQred in its 5 aminoquinol form and CuII (5 in Figure 4) are in fast 6 equilibrium with the semiquinone form and CuI (6 in Figure 4) [32]. The proportion of semiquinone­CuI varies from approximately 0­20% according to the temperature and the CuAO species, and whether it lies on the reaction pathway remains controversial. The structure of the 5 ECAO aminoquinol intermediate (5 in Figure 5) has been determined by anaerobically incubating crystals with excess substrate and then rapidly freezing to 100K before X-ray data collection [17··]. The aminoquinol is fully ordered, unlike the poorly ordered TPQ in the resting 1 enzyme (1 in Figure 5), with O2 hydrogen bonded to Wa (We is missing). The product aldehyde has not been released and remains bound in the substrate channel. Parallel studies of mutational variants of the active site base Asp383 in ECAO [12·] and Asp319 in HPAO [33·] emphasised the importance of TPQ mobility and conformation. An earlier systematic study screened 13 different Asp383 mutations in ECAO and showed that only Glu383 (D383E) remained active [16], confirming it as the active site base. Isotope effects in BSAO and HPAO had indicated that the substrate C­H bond cleavage step catalysed by the base is rate determining [34]. In D383E ECAO, the kcat/KM for -phenylethylamine oxidation is reduced by a factor of 6.4 × 10­4 compared to the wild type, whereas the D383N and D383A variants are inactive [12·]. The crystal structure of D383N is indistinguishable from that of the wild type, with TPQ in an `off-copper' conformation and O2 oriented towards the copper. In both cases, the edge of the TPQ ring nearer the copper (C2, O2, C3, C4, O4) is well defined in the electron density, while the opposite edge (C5, O5, C6) is not. This appears to result from TPQ lying in a wedgeshaped pocket, flanked by Asn465 and Val367, that grips the one edge of the TPQ ring, but allows the other to move. The pocket leaves space for the substrate to access the face of the ring to make the initial nucleophilic attack on C5. In D383A, TPQ is more disordered, with a significant contribution from the `on-copper' conformation, whereas D383E has TPQ highly ordered in an apparently active conformation. The longer glutamic acid sidechain intrudes into the pocket containing TPQ and blocks its motion. The interpretation was that TPQ motion and accessibility to the face of the ring are important for activity [12·]. Similarly, in HPAO, the catalytic properties of D319E are greatly impaired, with no activity against benzylamine and the kcat/KM for methylamine reduced by 80-fold, whereas D319N is inactive. Detailed spectroscopic and kinetic studies were interpreted in terms of increased, rather than reduced, TPQ mobility in D319E, in contrast to ECAO.

The significant population of a different, nonproductive TPQ orientation was proposed, in which it remains `off-copper' but flipped around 2 to direct O2 rather than O5 towards the base. In amine oxidases from both species (ECAO and HPAO), it is clear that the active site base has a role in controlling both the conformation and the mobility of TPQ. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies of mutational variants of Tyr305 in HPAO (Tyr369 in ECAO), which forms a short hydrogen bond to TPQ O4 (Figure 3), show that Y305A and Y305C have slightly impaired catalytic activity (3­7-fold), whereas that of Y305F is reduced by 500-fold [26]. Although this tyrosine is strictly conserved across all CuAO sequences, it is clearly not essential. It has two functions, the maintenance of TPQ orientation and participation in a hydrogen-bond network linking TPQ O4 to the copper (and dioxygen -- see below) via water molecules. The severe impairment of Y305F is interpreted as the loss of the latter function, with insufficient space for a water molecule to substitute for the lost hydroxyl group [26]. In the Y369F variant of ECAO, however, the kcat/KM for -phenylethylamine is reduced by only 50-fold [35]. The crystal structure of Y369F ECAO shows TPQ to be predominantly in a hitherto unobserved conformation, flipped about 2 to direct O5 towards the copper, but with a small rotation about 1 towards the copper into an intermediate `off-copper' position. This study emphasised the importance of Tyr369 in maintaining TPQ in its active conformation. A recent development was the detailed theoretical study of the reductive half reaction in PSAO [36·]. PSAO was an unexpected choice for the starting model, as the crystal structure was determined at low pH, at which the active site base was protonated and hydrogen bonded to TPQ O2 in a nonproductive conformation. Nevertheless, the model gave interesting results, giving C­H bond cleavage as the rate-determining step and emphasising the gain of aromaticity when TPQ is reduced as the driving force in this step.

Oxidative half reaction
The oxidative half reaction (4) has proved more difficult to study and some issues remain to be clarified. Although it had been expected that oxygen would be bound by CuI, followed by very rapid electron transfer to form the CuII­superoxide complex, Su and Klinman [18] showed, using a range of kinetic experiments, that the first electron transfer to oxygen appears to be rate determining. They proposed that oxygen first binds to another site in the enzyme and that the first electron transfer is from TPQred, rather than from copper, in the CuII­aminoquinol form. The copper would be needed solely for the electrostatic stabilisation of oxygen during its reduction, raising the question of whether copper is needed at all as an oxygen-binding site. This proposal implies that the CuI­semiquinone state is off the reaction pathway and its variable proportions in different species are not relevant to the mechanism. Other workers have assumed CuI to be the binding site, for instance, in a recent electron

Current Opinion in Structural Biology

Known structures of some of the intermediates in TPQ biogenesis and the catalytic cycle of ECAO (named as in Figure 4). Intermediates in the TPQ biogenesis pathway have residues labelled for comparison with their ECAO counterparts. For example, in the AGAO apoenzyme (PDB code 1AVK), Tyr382 corresponds to TPQ466 in ECAO. Also, His592 is found in two similar conformations [14]. The HPAO

zinc-substituted enzyme [28] (PDB code 1EKM) provides a view of the `on-copper' conformation (P1 in Figure 4). Coordinates for the catalytic cycle intermediates have been provided by ECAO [12·,16,17··] (PDB codes for intermediate 1: 1D6Y, plus modelled We ligand; 2: 1SPU; 5: 1D6U; 7: 1D6Z). Water molecules are shown as small red spheres.

paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study of ECAO [37]. Analysis of CO binding to reduced AGAO and ANAO revealed that it stabilises the semiquinone form and binds equatorially to CuI, showing very similar spectral

properties to CO­haemocyanin [38·]. Even a 50% CO atmosphere, however, does not inhibit oxygen turnover, which could be interpreted as support for CuI­semiquinone being off the pathway.

672

Catalysis and regulation

In a careful kinetic and spectroscopic study, the copper in HPAO was replaced by NiII, ZnII or CoII [39··]. Only the cobalt form, shown by EPR to be 90% CoII in the resting enzyme, retained specific activity (19%). As reduction to CoI is unlikely, this was taken as further evidence of a noncopper initial binding site for oxygen. Studies of metalsubstituted BSAO [40] and LSAO [41] also showed cobalt as functional. It has long been known, however, that cobalt can replace iron as the oxygen-binding site in haemoglobin, retaining both the oxygen-binding activity and most of the cooperativity. Azide inhibition of HPAO was shown to be noncompetitive with respect to oxygen [29], again consistent with a noncopper binding site, although earlier studies of porcine plasma amine oxidase (PPAO) indicated that azide is competitive. It is, however, notable that some CuAOs, such as the plant species, show significant accumulation of the semiquinone form, whereas others, such as HPAO and BSAO, do not. It is possible that more than one oxidative half reaction pathway is available, despite the very high structural similarity of the active sites. A structural view of the oxidative half cycle was shown by a study of freeze-trapped intermediates in ECAO crystals [17··]. In an attempt to trap the initial oxygen-binding step, crystals were anaerobically reduced with the -phenylethylamine substrate and exposed to NO before rapid freezing to 100K. In this structure, NO is axially coordinated to the copper through its nitrogen, with the oxygen hydrogen bonded to TPQ O2. It binds `end on', 2.4 Å from the copper, at an angle of 117°, and appears to form a CuII­NO­aminoquinol complex, with O2 of TPQ protonated. This structure is not shown in Figure 5, but is 7 similar to that of the turnover complex (7 in Figure 5), with NO in a similar position to the oxygen but lying at a slightly different angle. Interestingly, the aldehyde product remains bound in the entrance/exit tunnel, as for the reduced form, suggesting that the enzyme in the crystal would not show ping-pong kinetics under these conditions. The most interesting structure in the study was generated by prolonged exposure of an ECAO crystal to substrate in the presence of oxygen, allowing the reaction to reach an equilibrium turnover state, followed by rapid freezing to trap the intermediate [17··]. Dioxygen binds in a similar way to NO, but with its two oxygen atoms at 2.8 and 3.0 Å from the copper, with a Cu­O­O angle of 88°, 7 suggesting peroxide character (7 in Figure 5). One oxygen is hydrogen bonded to TPQ O2, while the other is linked to TPQ O4 by a hydrogen-bonding network via the hydroxyl of Tyr369 and a water molecule, W2, that is conserved in all four known CuAO structures. These hydrogen bonds provide routes for the transfer of the two hydrogens from TPQred that are necessary to generate hydrogen peroxide from oxygen. This intermediate must lie quite late on the pathway as the dioxygen appears to be fully reduced to peroxide and ready for release. Aldehyde product is again trapped in the substrate channel, interacting with Asp383. The aspartate is poised to activate a water molecule (W4 in 7 of Figure 5) for nucleophilic attack on

TPQ C5. This water lies only 3.0 Å from C5 and would be responsible for the release of ammonia and regeneration of the cofactor. This structure essentially completes the catalytic cycle, but does not give direct information on the initial oxygen-binding site.

Conclusions
The full catalytic cycle for CuAO is now close to being fully elucidated in both structural and chemical terms. The power of cryogenic trapping and crystal structure determination of intermediates has been impressively demonstrated, coupled to sophisticated kinetic and spectroscopic experiments. Full theoretical treatments of the mechanism are even envisaged. The reductive half cycle, in which amine is converted to aldehyde via a Schiff base intermediate, is well understood. The involvement of CuI as the oxygen-binding site, both in the oxidative half cycle and in biogenesis, is still a matter for debate. The suggestion of more than one possible pathway has been raised, even though all the known CuAO structures have closely similar active sites. If CuI is not the oxygen-binding site, as it is in other oxygenbinding copper proteins, then it raises interesting questions about why Nature chose copper over other metals for the amine oxidase catalytic centre.

An equilibrium turnover complex corresponding to a late stage in the oxidative half cycle shows the pathways for electron and proton transfer from TPQ to oxygen. The structure of the fully reduced form is also reported 18.
