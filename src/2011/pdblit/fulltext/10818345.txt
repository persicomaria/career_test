Crystallographic structures of oxidized and reduced forms of Ê azurin II are reported at 1.75 A resolution. Data were collected using one crystal in each case and by translating the crystal after each oscillation range to minimize photoreduction. Very small differences are observed at the Cu site upon reduction and these cannot be determined with con®dence at current resolution. A comparison with the three-dimensional EXAFS reveals a good correspondence for all the ligand distances except for CuÐHis46, where a larger Ê deviation of $0.12±0.18 A is observed, indicating that this ligand is more tightly restrained in the crystallographic re®nement at the current resolution.

1. Introduction
In the denitrifying bacterium A. xylosoxidans subspecies xylosoxidans NCIMB 11015 (formerly known as Alcaligenes sp. NCIMB 11015, Achromobacter xylosoxidans or Pseudomonas denitri®cans), the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide is accomplished by a copper-containing nitrite reductase (Abraham et al., 1993; Grossmann et al., 1993; Strange et al., 1995). Two classes of blue copper proteins, pseudoazurin and azurin, have so far been implicated in donating electrons to nitrite reductase; pseudoazurin to the green nitrite reductases of A. faecalis S-6 and Achrom. cycloclastes (Kakutani et al., 1981; Lui et al., 1986) and azurin to the blue nitrite reductases of A. xylosoxidans (Dodd, Hasnain, Abraham et al., 1995) and P. aureofaciens (Zumft & Kroneck, 1987). The X-ray crystal structures of six bacterial azurins have been reported: those from P. aeruginosa (AzPA; Adman & Jensen, 1981; Nar et al., 1991), A. denitri®cans (AzAD; Norris et al., 1983; Baker, 1988), P. ¯uorescens (Lee et al., 1997), Methylomonas J (Inoue et al., 1999) and two from A. xylosoxidans, azurin I (Li et al., 1998) and azurin II (Dodd, Hasnain, Hunter et al., 1995). The crystallographic structure of azurin II Ê has been determined to 1.9 A, while the structure of azurin I Ê has been determined at 2.45 A resolution. Crystallographic studies comparing the oxidized and reduced copper site of AzAD (Shepard et al., 1990) and poplar plastocyanin (Guss & Freeman, 1983; Guss et al., 1986) have also been reported. It has been suggested (Cotton & Wilkinson, 1988; Williams, 1985) that the copper coordination environment in the blue copper electron-transfer proteins is a compromise between the two preferred geometries of the redox states of the Cu atom, namely CuI and CuII. It has been argued that these distortions in the Cu coordination sphere result in an energized or entatic state of the Cu (Vallee & Williams, 1968; Williams, 1995). Such an environment should result in a lowering of the activation energy between the two redox states allowing rapid electron transfer to take place. To date, only

Oxidized and reduced azurin II

research papers
AzAD has been studied crystallographically in the two redox states and, contrary to EXAFS results (Groenveld et al., 1986; Murphy et al., 1990), little or no structural change was detected at the Cu site upon reduction. In order to de®ne the upper limit of structural changes, both EXAFS and crystallographic studies have been carried out on azurin II. EXAFS results are presented in the accompanying paper (Cheung et al., 2000). Here, the crystallographic structures of oxidized and reduced forms of azurin II are reported at the same high resolution of Ê 1.75 A. For the oxidized structure, photoreduction was kept to a minimum and data were collected by translating the crystal after each oscillation. The use of Weissenberg geometry and an off-line image-plate system (400 Â 400 mm) also allowed data to be collected with speed and minimum dead time between the two oscillation images.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Crystallization and crystal reduction

Azurin II from A. xylosoxidans used in the crystallization was supplied by the Nitrogen Fixation Laboratory, John Innes Centre, Norwich, where it was puri®ed by the method of Dodd, Hasnain, Abrahams et al. (1995). Crystals of azurin II used in the oxidized and reduced data collections were grown under the same conditions as those used for the original data collection (Dodd, Hasnain, Hunter et al., 1995). The crystal used in the reduced data collection was chemically reduced with an excess of dithionite. Reduction was observed as the dithionite diffused though the drop in $20 s. No other physical changes were observed in the crystals upon reduction. No special preparatory measures were taken with the crystals used for the oxidized data collection.
2.2. Data collection

oxidized and reduced data, the crystal orientation was determined manually and then re®ned using WEIS (Higashi, 1989) in conjunction with the image-display program IMAGE. The data were then scaled and merged using the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Data statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Data were collected from the oxidized and reduced azurin II crystals at beamline BL6A-2 at the Photon Factory, KEK using the Weissenberg technique (Sakabe, 1991) with Fuji image plates (200 Â 400 mm; Miyahara et al., 1986) and a Ê BA100 scanning system. An X-ray wavelength of 1.0 A was used with a 100 mm collimator de®ning the beam. The camera used for data collection was 2B, which holds two images, giving a total detector area of 400 Â 400 mm. Camera 2B gives a crystal-to-image-plate distance of 286.5 mm. Both oxidized and reduced data sets were collected using the same parameters. Data were collected at 285 K. The oscillation per image was 4.5 with 0.2 overlap and a coupling constant of 2 mmÀ1. A total of 12 images were exposed for a time of 135 s, giving a total oscillation range of 47.5 . Each data set was obtained from a single crystal. The oxidized crystal was translated to a fresh point after every exposure since X-ray-induced reduction of the crystal had been observed in the past (Dodd, Hasnain, Abraham et al., 1995; Debenham et al., 1996). The reduced crystal was translated every other exposure in order to avoid the collection of data from radiation-damaged areas. For both

2.3. Refinement

The structures of azurin II in the oxidized and reduced form È were re®ned with the program X-PLOR version 3.0 (Brunger, 1992b). Standard topology and parameter ®les derived from the Cambridge Structural Database library were used, as suggested by Engh & Huber (1991). A charge of +2 was used for the Cu atom in the oxidized re®nement and +1 for the Cu atom in the reduced re®nement. No restraints were applied to the copper±ligand distances or to any bond angles in the copper site. Copper was included as an anomalous scatterer Ê with f HH = 2.282 at 1.00 A. Prior to the re®nement, the Rfree Ê È (Brunger, 1992a) ¯ags from the original 1.9 A data set were transferred to the oxidized and reduced data sets. New re¯ection data were segregated from both data sets and 10% Ê of these in the resolution range 50±1.75 A were selected to add to those previously selected for cross-validation data, the test set. This gave a working set of 20 175 re¯ections and a test set of 2296 re¯ections for the oxidized data. The working set for the reduced data contained 19 664 re¯ections, with a test set of 2231 re¯ections.

3. Results and discussion
The basic folding unit of azurin II is an eight-stranded -barrel which can be described as two -sheets which are sandwiched together (Fig. 1). The ®rst, which shows a classic twisted -sheet form, consists of strands 1, 3, 6 and the ®rst few residues of strand 2. The second consists of strands 5, 4, 7, 8 and the majority of the residues in strand 2. Strand 2 has a pronounced kink at residues 16±17 where it ceases to be strongly associated to strand 1 in the ®rst -sheet and becomes more extensively hydrogen bonded to strand 8 in the second -sheet. A ¯ap between strands 4 and 5 consisting of $30 residues (52±81) contains the only helical feature in the structure. This ¯ap is separated from the main body of the molecule by an interface of non-polar residues. The ¯ap starts with a small loop before entering an -helical region (residues 55±67). Towards the end of the helix its character changes as it becomes more similar to a 310 helix. The remainder of the ¯ap (residues 68±81) forms an irregular loop. The molecule contains a single disul®de bridge between cysteines 3 and 26. This bridge stabilizes the N-terminus of the molecule. The copper site of azurin II lies in what is known as the `northern' part (Guss & Freeman, 1983) of the molecule. The Ê Cu atom has three short ligands at $2 A and is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar arrangement. The ligands are His46 N1, His117 N1 and Cys112 S. In addition to the three

The initial oxidized re®nement with the new data used the Ê model directly from the previous re®nement at 1.9 A (Dodd, Hasnain, Abraham et al., 1995). The model was subjected to a round of re®nement consisting of 40 cycles of conjugategradient minimization followed by individual B-factor re®nement over 20 cycles using data in the resolution range Ê 8.5±1.75 A. This procedure resulted in a crystallographic R factor of 21.7%, with an Rfree of 23.4%. The quality of the model was assessed in detail before proceeding with further re®nement. In the Ramachandran plot, 89.4% of the residues fell in the most favoured regions, with two residues falling in the additionally allowed regions and a single residue, Gln2, in the generously allowed region. The electron-density maps showed signi®cant improvement over those calculated using Ê the 1.9 A data at the end of the previous re®nement. This allowed some rebuilding of the structure to be carried out where minor ambiguities persisted in the previous model. This rebuilding and a further round of re®nement resulted in a reduction of the crystallographic R factor to 20.0%, with an Rfree of 22.1%. The next stage of model building was to include additional waters in the model using Fobs À Fcalc difference density maps contoured at +3'. A total of 63 peaks were examined in O (Jones et al., 1991) against the density and for proximity to suitable hydrogen-bonding partners. Waters were only accepted where their positions were found to be coincident in the oxidized and reduced structures. This was performed to allow more meaningful comparisons between the two structures to be made. From these 63 peaks computed as potential waters, 17 were selected as water molecules for inclusion in the model. A further round of re®nement lead to an R factor of 18.9% and an Rfree of 20.5%. Finally, the model was re®ned against all the test data, which resulted in a ®nal crystallographic R factor of 18.9% for data in the resolution Ê range 8.5±1.75 A.
2.5. Reduced azurin II refinement

The reduced crystal structure of azurin II was re®ned using the same protocol as for the oxidized structure. The initial re®nement resulted in a crystallographic R factor of 21.3%, with an Rfree of 23.4%. The Ramachandran plot was very similar to the oxidized structure, with 89.4% of the residues falling in the most favoured regions. Two residues fell in the additionally allowed regions and a single residue, again Gln2, in the generously allowed region. Rebuilding and further re®nement were performed, resulting in a reduction of the crystallographic R factor to 20.4%, with an Rfree of 22.9%. The additional 17 waters were then included in the model (47 peaks were examined in O). Re®nement with the new waters led to an R factor of 19.1% and an Rfree of 21.4%. Re®nement of the model against all data resulted in a ®nal crystallographic Ê R factor of 19.2% for data in the resolution range 8.5±1.75 A. In addition, an anisotropic B-factor re®nement of the Cu atom and the two copper-site S atoms was performed using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). This re®nement did not reveal any signi®cant anisotropy at the copper site.

3.1. Quality of the oxidized and reduced structures

The structures of oxidized and reduced azurin II have been Ê re®ned to 1.75 A resolution with moderately good R factors of 18.9 and 19.2%, respectively. The free R factors of both oxidized and reduced structures are only a little larger, being È 20.5 and 21.4%, respectively. The free R factors (Brunger, 1992a) were calculated by excluding 10% of the re¯ections until the ®nal round of re®nement. These free R factors and their closeness to the R factors con®rm the quality of the overall structure. The r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths and Ê angles were 0.008 A and 1.5 , respectively, for both the oxidized and reduced structures (Table 1). In addition to the assessment of the structure through an overall quality factor, it is important to assess the accuracy and reliability of different parts of the structure (Table 1). Ramachandran plots (Ramachandran et al., 1963; Rama-

chandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) show 89.4 and 88.5% of the residues in the core regions for the oxidized and reduced structures, respectively. In both structures, only Gln2 is in the additionally allowed regions. The main-chain and side-chain properties, as detailed in Laskowski et al. (1993), of these structures are in good agreement with other well re®ned structures. PROCHECK notes none of the residues in either structure as having a distorted geometry. Additional checks of the model geometry (Table 1) were made using OOPS (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996). A further guide to the quality of the structures in different regions is provided by an inspection of atomic B factors. The mean B factors for all the protein atoms Ê Ê are 20.3 and 19.3 A2, and for the waters are 36.5 and 36.3 A2, for the oxidized and reduced structures, respectively. Ê The Cu atom has B factors of 15.5 and 9.5 A2 in the oxidized and reduced structures, respectively. In the oxidized structure, the B factors of the copper ligands are 17.3, 11.7, 11.5, 12.5 and Ê 15.5 A2 for Gly45 O, His46 N1, Cys112 S, His117 N1 and Met121 S, respectively. In the reduced structure, the B factors Ê were 13.9, 9.6, 14.2, 12.6 and 12.7 A2 for Gly45 O, His46 N1, Cys112 S, His117 N1 and Met121 S, respectively. The estiÊ mated uncertainties for the B factors were 2.7 and 2.5 A2 for the oxidized and reduced structures, respectively.

3.2.1. The copper sites. Comparison of the copper sites of the oxidized and reduced models of azurin II show there to be very little difference between the structures (Fig. 2, Table 2). The copper geometry consists of three strong planar ligands (namely His46 N1, His117 N1 and Cys112 S, the NNS plane), which are arranged in a distorted trigonal plane about the Cu atom. Two other atoms interact with the copper, Gly45 O and Met121 S. These are in axial positions with respect to the trigonal plane. The transition from the oxidized to the reduced form results in only small changes in the positions of the ligands which are well within the experimental Ê errors. The His46 N1 copper bond is shortened by 0.01 A in 1 the reduced structure, with the His117 N and Cys112 S Ê bond lengths increasing by 0.03 and 0.02 A, respectively. The Ê bond length to Gly45 O increases by 0.03 A, while the  Met121 S distance remains unchanged. In both re®nements, the position of the Cu atom is essentially in the NNS plane, the Ê deviation being 0.01 A. The only notable difference between the oxidized and reduced copper sites is the change in B factor Ê of the Cu atom from 15.5 to 9.5 A2, given respective estimated Ê uncertainties in B factors of 2.7 and 2.5 A2 for the two structures. The reduction in the B factor may partially be a consequence of a slightly tighter position of the Cu atom in the reduced state copper (I) compared with the oxidized state copper (II). The higher B for CuII may indicate a slightly delocalized nature of Cu in the oxidized state. These minimal changes are consistent with the requirements for fast electron transfer (Marcus & Sutin, 1985). Similar small changes have been observed between the oxidized and reduced forms of AzAD (Shepard et al., 1990), Ê which have been studied at 1.8 and 1.9 A, respectively (Table 2). These structures support the view that the protein structure surrounding the Cu atom provides an environment which is optimized for the function of biological electron transfer. The rigidity of the azurin II structure, with the copper site being constrained by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, allows little movement upon change in redox state of the Cu atom. Thus, the Cu atom is held in a geometry which is an intermediate between the trigonal planar favoured by copper (I) and the square planar or tetrahedral favoured by copper (II). Such a state is said to be entatic, in which the Cu atom is bound in an energized conformation (Vallee & Williams, 1968; Williams, 1995). However, calculations of the energy state of other blue copper sites have revealed there to be little strain, casting doubt upon the idea of the copper binding being entatic (Ryde et al., 1996). Qualitatively, this the lack of an energized binding state for copper is explained by the NNS plane binding the copper so that two of the Cu2+ d(x2 À y2) electron-orbital lobes interact with the two N atoms as ' bonds and the remaining two Cu2+ d(x2 À y2) lobes interact with the two lobes of the Cys112 S % orbital, completing an undistorted square-planar bonding arrangeÈ ment for Cu2+ (Solomon et al., 1998; Malmstrom & Leckner, 1998). In the reduced Cu site, the interaction between the Cys112 S and the Cu+ is weakened (Guckert et al., 1995). The increased stability of oxidized versus reduced azurin against guanidine hydrochloride denaturation suggests that the

oxidized form is not bound in an energized state (Leckner et al., 1997; Wittung-Stafshede et al., 1998), supporting the È hypothesis of `rack' induced bonding (Malmstrom, 1994).
3.3. Accuracy and precision 3.3.1. Global accuracy and precision. The average positional error, Ár, in the atomic coordinates of a structure can be estimated in several ways. A plot of R factor against resolution calculated by the method of Luzzati (1952) suggests Ê an average coordinate error of 0.15 A for both the oxidized and reduced structures. This method, however, has a number of shortcomings in terms of its approximations. Luzzati assumes that there are no errors in the experimentally determined structure factors, which is clearly not the case, and that all re¯ections are present. It is also assumed the only errors in the calculated structure factors come from coordinate errors in the model and that these errors are the same for all atoms. Since the scattering power of atoms decreases signi®cantly with B factor, the errors determined by this method will at best give an estimate of the errors in the best determined regions. A ' A plot (Read, 1986) of ln(' A) as a function of sin2/!2 Ê indicates an average error of 0.28 and 0.24 A for the oxidized and reduced structures, respectively. However, this method also assumes that there is a normal distribution of errors. It also assumes that any atoms missing from the model are of the same type and have the same overall B factor as those of atoms present. This is clearly a poor assumption, as those missing atoms tend to be the less well ordered solvent. The diffraction data-precision indicator (DPI; Cruickshank, 1996) gives a `quick and rough guide' for the diffraction data only error for an atom with the same B factor as that determined by the Wilson plot. This has been extended to incorporate the free R factor as the expected value of the crystallographic residual (Murshudov & Dodson, 1997). This approach also takes into account the numbers of observations and atoms, the resolution and the completeness of the data used in the re®nement. The DPIs for the re®nement of Ê Ê oxidized and reduced azurin II at 1.75 A are 0.09 and 0.08 A, respectively. 3.3.2. Accuracy and precision at the copper site. It remains problematic to know what precision can be claimed for the atomic positions in a correctly determined and competently re®ned structure at modest resolution. The average coordinate error can be estimated by the DPI, but this does not provide an accurate assessment for the accuracy of a particular part of the structure, e.g. the metal site in a metalloprotein. In several cases, the differences in the crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit have been used to provide an assessment of accuracy of metal±ligand bond distances. For Ê AzAD (Baker, 1988), an average `maximum error' of 0.04 A was estimated for copper±ligand distances, while for AzPA Ê (Nar et al., 1991) a precision ranging from 0.01 to 0.11 A was calculated from the four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Guss et al. (1992) pointed out that as the structures of the molecules in the asymmetric unit are not independently determined, the error estimates based on internal selfActa Cryst. (2000).

From these criteria, the larger deviation for A further consideration in the positional accuracy with His46 observed here with respect to EXAFS is outside the which atomic positions can be determined is the B factors of Ê range. We note that in the 1.33 A re®ned structure of plastothose atoms. The B factor of an atom is related to the atomic cyanin (Guss et al., 1992), a good agreement has been found displacement amplitude, u, by B = 8%2hu2i. Thus, for an atom Ê with the metrical information obtained from EXAFS data of with a B factor of 10 A2, close to the minimum for either solution (Murphy et al., 1990) and single-crystal (Scott et al., oxidized or reduced structures, the r.m.s. displacement will be Ê Ê 1982) plastocyanin. For plastocyanin, all of the ligand 0.36 A. At the average B factor for the structures, $20 A2, the Ê, Ê . At the upper limit, distances had shortened somewhat in going from 1.6 to 1.33 A r.m.s. displacement increases to 0.50 A Ê Ê but Cu±His37, which is equivalent to Cu±His46 in azurin, had around 45 A2, the r.m.s. displacement is 0.75 A. However, this Ê (Table 3). Thus, it is likely that different shortened by 0.13 A does not give us useful information concerning the accuracy to ligands are affected to a different extent by the improvement which bond lengths can be determined, as the B factors relate in resolution as the effects of restraints are reduced. We note to an atom's mobility and not its positional accuracy. In that His46 (His37 of plastocyanin) is from a separate chain general, the bond lengths are also restrained by the geometric compared with the other three residues (Cys112, His117 and information used in the re®nement. Met121), which are in close proximity at the C-terminus. It is clear that the overall geometry of the copper site in azurin II is maintained in the two redox states. A cursory 4. Conclusions glance at the metrical data would suggest that there are no detectable differences between the two structures. However, The slight expansion in the copper site and lowering in B we know from the EXAFS studies of azurin II (Cheung et al., factor of the Cu atom upon the reduction of the Cu atom from 2000) and of other azurins that a signi®cant change at the copper (II) to copper (I) results in minimal geometric changes copper site takes place.
