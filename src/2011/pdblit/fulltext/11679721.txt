A data set from the metalloproteinase deuterolysin was Ê collected at atomic resolution (1.0 A) with synchrotron radiation. The high resolution allowed the structure to be solved with the new direct-methods program ACORN using the coordinates of the Zn atom as a starting point. The phases obtained from ACORN were of suf®cient quality to allow automated building to be carried out in ARP/wARP. Minimal manual rebuilding of the model was required and the structure determination was completed using the maximum-likelihood re®nement program REFMAC. The whole process, starting from the processed and merged data and ending with a re®ned model, required less than 6 h of computational time.

Protein structures have mainly been solved at resolutions Ê less than atomic (roughly de®ned for this purpose as 1.2 A or better) and this has necessitated determination of initial phases either from experimental techniques such as multiple isomorphous replacement or multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, or by molecular replacement using a homologous model. These phases were required to be of suf®cient quality to construct an atomic model, which is subsequently re®ned with imposition of stereochemical restraints during leastsquares or maximum-likelihood-based minimization. This was in marked contrast to the situation for small molecules, for Ê which truly atomic resolution data, usually around 0.8 A spacing, allowed the ab initio solution of the structure either by the heavy-atom method, where a substructure is de®ned from a Patterson synthesis, or more commonly by direct methods based on statistical relationships between the phases once the structure-factor amplitudes are known. The last decade has seen a formidable advance in the datacollection facilities and techniques available to the macromolecular crystallographer. These have involved the use of more intense X-ray sources, in particular dedicated synchrotron beamlines, highly ef®cient two-dimensional detectors in the form of imaging plates, and more recently charge-coupled devices, and of cryogenic vitri®cation to alleviate the effects of radiation damage and extend the resolution of data accessible. Taken together, these advances have led to the realisation that a signi®cant number of protein crystals indeed diffract to atomic resolution. For the ®rst set of such structures, the major gain was the ability to carry out more complete re®nement of the structures, typically with an anisotropic atomic model and riding H atoms, and effectively to release the nonexperimental stereochemical restraints. Restraints were of course still needed for the poorly ordered regions and some

addition, it gives an objective electron-density map with no selection of atoms on the way. The deviation of the ACORNderived phases from those of the re®ned model can be as low as 15±20 and the resulting density maps closely resemble those for the complete model, even in the ordered solvent regions. In this work, we describe the application of ACORN to solve the structure of a zinc metalloproteinase, deuterolysin from Aspergillus oryzae, for which atomic resolution data could be measured but for which no homology model was available. This was the ®rst determination of the structure of an unknown protein using ACORN.
1.2. Deuterolysin

restraints on the atomic displacement factors were still applied comparable to those used in small-molecule analyses. The structures still posed problems in terms of solution: ab initio phasing from a single data set seemed an almost insurmountable task for most proteins. In addition, the re®nement procedure was relatively tedious, requiring considerable user input to exploit fully the available data. Recent advances in computer power and in algorithms for phasing have started to transform the ®eld. The Shake-and-Bake method (Weeks et al., 1994; Weeks & Miller, 1999; Xu et al., 2000) and the HalfBaked approach with a wealth of associated techniques such as E-map peak enhancement (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) have been applied to increasingly large structures. Methods based on more conventional direct-methods schemes have also had some success, again especially for metalloproteins (Mukherjee, 1999; Mukherjee et al., 1999). ACORN is a new program designed to solve protein structures ab initio at atomic resolution (Foadi et al., 2000), providing some limited initial phasing from a substructure is available. A small ± or indeed large ± fragment can be used as a search model and placed in the P1 cell using a molecularreplacement approach. The fragment can be as small as a single -helix. Alternatively, an experimental substructure, such as a metal or a set of S, Se or similar atoms, can be located from anomalous scattering measurements. ACORN then uses a combination of approaches, most importantly dynamic density modi®cation, to develop a re®ned set of phases. Key to the procedure is the use of a correlation factor for the weak amplitudes as a criterion of phase quality. The program has been shown to be effective for a variety of test cases, ranging from haem-containing proteins and small proteins such as lysozyme and RNAse AP1 to larger proteins, e.g. penicillopepsin with 323 residues and a molecular weight of 34 kDa (Foadi et al., 2000). The advantage of ACORN over other methods for phasing protein structures is that it can be readily applied to larger proteins and that it is extremely fast. In

Metalloproteinases have been classi®ed into more than 30 different families, many of which contain a HExxH motif that forms part of the metal-binding site (Rawlings & Barrett, 1995). The two histidine residues in the motif coordinate a Zn atom and the glutamate is the catalytic residue. The families containing this HExxH motif previously belonged to either clan MA, MB or MX based on evolutionary relationships and the identity of the third residue coordinating the zinc. The gluzincins have a glutamate as the third zinc ligand (HExxH + E) and belonged to clan MA. Clan MB contained the metzincins, which have HExxH + H and a conserved Metturn. However, as more three-dimensional structures became available, it was observed that there were common structural motifs in both the gluzincins and the metzincins and so clans MA and MB were merged to become clan MA. The motif for clan MA is now HExxH + E, H or D (http://www.merops.co.uk; Rawlings & Barrett, 2000). In clan MX, the identity of the third ligand to the zinc is unknown. Deuterolysin from A. oryzae (previously known as neutral proteinase II) is a zinc metalloproteinase consisting of 177 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 19 kDa and three disul®de bridges (Tatsumi et al., 1994). Deuterolysins belong to clan MX and family M35. They contain the HExxH motif, but until recently the third residue coordinating the zinc was unknown. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on the enzyme from A. oryzae con®rmed that His128 and His132 are zinc ligands and that Glu129 is a catalytically crucial residue (Fushimi et al., 1999). These studies also identi®ed an aspartic acid residue (Asp164) as the third zinc ligand and, as a consequence, a new family name for deuterolysins containing the zinc-binding motif HExxH + D was proposed: the `aspzincins'.

2.1. Crystallization

Crystals of deuterolysin were grown at 291 K by vapour diffusion from hanging drops. 1 ml of a 30 mg mlÀ1 protein solution was mixed with 1 ml of a precipitant solution containing 1.8 M sodium/potassium phosphate, 0.1 M HEPES buffer pH 7.5. The drop was equilibrated against 1 ml of the precipitant solution. Large needle-shaped crystals grew within

The crystals were soaked brie¯y in 2.0 M sodium/potassium phosphate, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 25% ethylene glycol before vitri®cation in liquid nitrogen. The data were collected at 100 K using an ADSC Q4 CCD detector on beamline ID14-2 at the ESRF. Two different crystal-to-detector distances (60 and 290 mm for high- and low-resolution data, respectively) were used with oscillation steps of 0.5 and 1.5 , respectively. The data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) (Table 1). Subsequent crystallographic calculations mainly used programs from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).
2.3. Phasing

ACORN requires a small initial fragment of the structure to be positioned and the size of the fragment can be less than 5% of the scattering matter of the unit cell. For a metalloprotein, the position of the metal alone makes a suitable starting point for phase re®nement. The coordinates of the Zn atom of deuterolysin were determined by calculating an anomalous Ê difference Patterson over the resolution range 30±1 A. The zinc position needed to be given with an error of less than Ê 0.3 A for the procedure to be successful: use of a coarse interpolation grid resulted in a suf®cient error in the estimated coordinate to prevent its successful use as a starting point. The strongest peak in the Harker section of the anomalous difference Patterson was observed at (u, v, w) = (0.115, 0.5, 0.540). This peak was also clearly dominant in the sharpened native Patterson map calculated using normalized structure

factors (Fig. 1), indicating that the anomalous information was not in fact required. Normalized structure factors (E) were calculated from the native protein data using the program ECALC (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The coordinates of the Zn atom were input into ACORN and phase development was carried out by dynamic density modi®cation (DDM) for 38 cycles using the 18 566 largest E values (E > 1.2). The correlation coef®cient (CCs) for the re¯ections with small E values (E < 1.2) increased from 0.00942 to 0.45529, indicating that a solution had been obtained (Foadi et al., 2000). The time required was 3 min (Table 2). Indeed, the structure could also be solved without knowledge of the zinc position: a solution was obtained from 5000 trials starting from a single atom in a random position. In this case, 49 cycles of DDM were required and the CCs for the smallest E values increased from 0.00846 to 0.45318. The situation is of course simpli®ed by the nature of the space group: in P21 only the x and z parameters need to be varied for the single-atom starting `fragment'. The time required for this computation was still only 8 min, probably rather faster than computing, displaying and solving the Patterson in practice.

The electron-density maps obtained at this stage were of excellent quality and it would have been simple to build the protein model using typical protein-tracing methods. However, it was preferred to build the model in an automated fashion using REFMAC combined with ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999). The phases from ACORN were input into the warpNtrace mode of ARP/wARP. Initially, 1509 water molecules were located in the map calculated with the phases from ACORN; these free atoms were re®ned in REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997, 1999) for one cycle and then building of the protein main chain commenced. The initial trace consisted of 169 residues in four protein chains; this increased to 173 residues in two chains after the second building cycle. In between building cycles, four cycles of REFMAC re®nement were carried out. Further building steps failed to build the missing residues and so the program was therefore terminated after the fourth building cycle. The R factor and free R factor were 37.6 and 39.5%, respectively, at the beginning of the ARP/wARP procedure and decreased to 19.2 and 23.1% at the

end. The initial building of the main chain required 100 min of computational time, but this time could be reduced by decreasing the number of re®nement cycles between ARP updates and by performing just two building steps (Table 2). The side chains were added to the model using the sidedock script of ARP/wARP, which relates the protein fragments to the given amino-acid sequence and then ®ts the side chains using real-space torsional re®nement. The missing residues and the zinc ion were added manually to the model using XtalView (McRee, 1999). Anisotropic maximum-likelihood re®nement of the resulting model was continued using REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997, 1999) combined with the addition of water molecules by ARP/wARP. Solvent molecules were added to positive density peaks greater than 3' in the REFMACweighted mFo À DFc map if there were acceptable hydrogenbonding distances to neighbouring atoms. Waters were removed from the model if their density was less than 1.0' in the 2mFo À DFc map. Visual inspection and manual adjustments to the model were carried out using XtalView. The ®nal model consists of 1380 non-H protein atoms, 260 water molecules, three molecules of ethylene glycol and a zinc ion. The geometry is good and the protein model was veri®ed using the programs PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phasing and automated building of the model

Metalloproteins are easier to solve by direct methods as the early cycles locate the heavy atoms and the rest of the structure can then be developed from that. For deuterolysin, the zinc was input into ACORN and a phase set with an excellent correlation coef®cient was very quickly obtained. ACORN has previously shown to be an effective tool for phasing of proteins structures using trial data, but this work is the ®rst example of its use in determining the structure of an unknown protein. The solution of the structure required only 3 min CPU time on a Silicon Graphics O2. Even without inputting the coordinates of the zinc, it was possible to obtain a solution by starting from 5000 random atom fragments and this increased the CPU time to just 8 min, still a very time-ef®cient method. The maps calculated at this stage were of excellent quality (Fig. 2) and the mean phase discrepancy compared with the ®nal model was only 14 .

The quality of the ACORN phases was examined further by calculating the correlation coef®cient between the ACORN map and the ®nal map as a function of residue number using the program OVERLAPMAP (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994; Fig. 3a). The correlation for the protein main chain is very high, ranging from 0.78 to 0.97. The correlations for the side chains are also generally high, with the majority of residues in the range 0.6±0.97. However, some

side chains have lower correlation coef®cients, i.e. between 0.6 and 0.3. A comparison of the side-chain correlation coef®cients with the average side-chain B values was made (Fig. 3b) and it is clear that low correlation coef®cients correlate strongly with higher B values. In all cases, the residues with poor correlation coef®cients and high B values are located on the surface of the protein. Fig. 2(c) shows the differences in electron density between the ®nal map and the ACORN map for one of these surface residues. Almost the complete protein main chain was automatically built in ARP/ wARP 5.1 after only a few building cycles. The four missing amino acids were the N- and C- terminal residues and a cis-proline with its neighbouring residue. These are places where the warpNtrace algorithm can be expected to have dif®culties in its present implementation. The four missing residues could easily be ®tted to the density, requiring only a few minutes on the graphics computer. The progress and more details of the building and re®nement steps are given in Table 3.

Deuterolysin is an  protein with a zincin-like fold. It comprises eight helices and four strands of -sheet. There are three disul®de bridges between residues A6±A78, A85±A103 and A117±A177; the last of these involves the C-terminal residue, which bridges to a cysteine residue located on a loop region between helices D and E. The secondary structure of deuterolysin is shown in Fig. 4. A BLAST search (Altschul et al., 1990) had shown that deuterolysin had no signi®cant sequence homology to any other protein in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000). To look for structural homology with other proteins in the PDB, the program TOP was used (Lu, 2000). TOP outputs a list of homologous proteins ranked according to their topological similarities. A topology search using TOP revealed that the most closely structurally related enzyme, at the time this work was carried out, was the zinc protease from Streptomyces caespitosus (also known as snapalysin; PDB code 1kuh), giving a topological diversity score of 20.0 and with six matching secondary-structure

elements. Although these proteins are similar structurally, the sequence homology is very low. The other proteins with low values of topological diversity in the list are the other metalloproteinases belonging to clan MA, e.g. leishmanolysin, thermolysin and astacin. Although these proteins belong to clan MA, they are divided into different families within the clan. The structural similarity relating these metalloproteins lies in the arrangement of -sheets and -helices that form the active site. A comparison of the structures of deuterolysin, snapalysin, leishmanolysin, astacin and thermolysin is shown in Fig. 5. The structure of another aspzincin with 21% sequence homology to deuterolysin, the metalloproteinase from Grifola frondosa, has recently been determined (Hori et al., 2001). This enzyme is closely related in structure to deuterolysin, Ê with an r.m.s. difference in C positions of 1.2 A and a topological diversity score of 8.4, yet it is still a poor molecular replacement search model.
3.3. Active-site residues

The active site is located in a large cleft on the protein surface formed by -sheets and an -helix. The histidine residues coordinating the zinc are located on this helix (E). The Zn atom is liganded by two histidine residues (His128 and His132), an aspartic acid residue (Asp143) and two water molecules, forming a distorted octahedral geometry as shown Ê in Fig. 6. The metal±ligand distances range from 2.05 to 2.35 A, falling into the expected range for zinc metal geometry (Harding, 1999). Several of the angles within the octahedron deviate by more than 10 from ideal values and this distortion is a consequence of accommodation of the bidentate carboxylate group of Asp143. The catalytic residue which promotes the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the carbonyl C atom of the substrate is Glu129. The structure con®rms that deuterolysin is an aspzincin as proposed by Fushimi et al. (1999), but there is a disagreement in the identity of the aspartic acid that ligands the zinc. Fushimi and coworkers deduced this was Asp164 after their studies showed that mutating this to an asparagine residue led to loss of the zinc ion, whereas the Asp1433Asn mutant retained the zinc. It is not clear why the Asp143 mutant retained the zinc; however, a suggestion as to why mutating Asp164 led to loss of the zinc can be made. Asp164 is located Ê close to His128, with a distance of 2.86 A between the carboxylate oxygen OD1 of Asp164 and nitrogen ND1 of the histidine. The loss of this interaction after mutation to asparagine may lead to a change in the orientation or position of this histidine, resulting in loss of zinc-binding ability.
3.4. Conclusions

the present version of warpNtrace took approximately 20 min of computing and, since the algorithm was developed for structures at substantially lower resolution, this can almost certainly be substantially reduced in the future for maps of this quality. Perhaps the most important message from this study is that ACORN has made it extremely easy to compute in a fast and automatic way a set of phases which are close to correct for an atomic resolution structure, avoiding extensive and iterative computations for re®nement and in particular long periods at a molecular graphics terminal. In addition, the electron-density map obtained with the ACORN phases is devoid of subjective input with regard to an atomic model, relying solely on the dynamic density-modi®cation algorithm. This makes ACORN ideal for deriving unbiased phase sets when ligands are introduced to a protein and the con®guration of the complex is uncertain. The crystallographer can instead spend his/her time analysing those details of the structure relevant to the functional questions addressed, or indeed the real structural detail of the molecule. In spite of a lack of signi®cant sequence homology, deuterolysin has been shown to be an aspzincin, related in three-dimensional fold to the thermolysin family of metalloproteinases. However, the aspartate which ligates the zinc is different from that expected from biochemical studies. None of the homologous proteins were suf®ciently similar to deuterolysin to act as effective search models for molecular replacement. This demonstrates the need for more than one member of homology families. Even if through structural genomics studies we can solve a representative structure of each `fold family', this will not be suf®cient to solve the structures of highly varying members of a family by molecular replacement, let alone homology modelling with our present algorithms.
