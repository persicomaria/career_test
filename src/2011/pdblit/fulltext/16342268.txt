Introduction. The peroxiredoxin (Prx) constitutes a family of antioxidant proteins that act as peroxidases that reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl peroxide to water and the corresponding alcohol, respectively.1­3 Prxs participate in the antioxidative mechanism called the "thioredoxin system."4,5 The typical 2-Cys Prxs have two conserved redox-active cysteines: the peroxidatic cysteine and the resolving cysteine. The peroxidase reaction results in an intersubunit disulfide bond between these redox-active cysteines concomitant with the reduction of peroxide substrate. The tertiary structures for Prxs from several sources have been reported, distinct quaternary structures, for example, monomer,6 dimer,7­12 and toroid-shaped decamer,13­18 being observed depending on the subtype and redox state. However, the tertiary structure of a hyperthermophilic Prx has not been reported to date. We previously identified the genes for thioredoxin peroxidase, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase in the genome of Aeropyrum pernix K1,19,20 which lives at the highest temperature among the aerobic organisms whose genome sequences are available.21,22 We presented the first evidence of a set of proteins involved in the thioredoxin system in archaea by confirming the activity.19,20 Mutational analyses of thioredoxin peroxidase from A. pernix K1 (ApTPx) showed that peroxidatic Cys50 and resolving Cys213 form an intersubunit disulfide bond upon oxidation and that another cysteine residue (Cys207) is not essential for the peroxidase function.20 Although we had proposed a ring structure consisting of eight subunits,20 we found a fivefold axis and five twofold axes in a crystal of ApTPx (C207S mutant) in a later study.23 This suggested that the overall structure of ApTPx consists of decameric ring, which is homologous to Prxs from human,13 Salmonella typhimurium,15,16 and Crithidia fasciculate.14 In this article, we describe the tertiary structure of a selenomethionine derivative of the C207S mutant of ApTPx (SeC207S) in the reduced form determined at 2.0-Å resolution. We also discuss the characteristic features of this hyperthermostable Prx protein. Materials and Methods. Expression and purification of SeC207S were performed as described23 except that the

Escherichia coli cells were cultivated in a modified M9 medium.24 Crystals of SeC207S were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. A 4- L drop comprising 10 mg/mL SeC207S, 5 mM DTT, 50 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 6.5), and 500 mM sodium acetate was equilibrated against 450 L of a reservoir solution comprising 60 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 6.5) and 600 mM sodium acetate at 20°C. A crystal was soaked in a solution of 1.25 concentration of the reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and then flash-frozen. Diffraction data were collected at BL38B1, SPring-8 (Harima, Japan), and processed using HKL2000.25 Selenium sites were searched with SOLVE26 and SHARP.27 Initial phases were calculated by the MAD method, and improved using SOLOMON.28 Refinement at 2.0 Å was performed using CNS.29 Stereochemical analysis, secondary structure assignment, structural comparisons, and calculation of the accessible surface area were carried out using PROCHECK,30 DSSP,31 CHIMERA,32 and GRASP,33 respectively. The data collection statistics and the crystallographic refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Results and Discussion. The monomer structure of SeC207S is presented in Figure 1(a). The monomer structure can be divided into a main domain (Pro2­Leu167 and Arg220 ­Ala245) and an arm domain (Lys168 ­Ser219). The arm domain is composed of 6, an antiparallel -sheet comprising three -strands [ 9, 10, and 11, see Fig. 1(a)], and a neighboring unstructured region. The arm domain and subsequent C-terminal region are unique to ApTPx (discussed later).

ApTPx forms homodimers [Fig. 1(b)]. The dimer interface is created between the main domains. The arm domains stick out from the main body of the dimer [circles in Fig. 1(c)]. In addition to a 14-stranded twisted intersubunit -sheet [Fig. 1(c), bottom], the N-terminal 1 in both subunits form an antiparallel -sheet [arrow in Fig. 1(b)] in the homodimer structure. This N-terminal -sheet is unique to ApTPx and thus is not found in mesophilic Prxs. The overall structure of ApTPx comprises a decameric ring consisting of five homodimers [Fig. 1(d)]. There are two types of dimer­ dimer interactions: one (the MM interaction) involves main domains and the other (the AM interaction) involves arm and main domains [Fig. 1(e)]. Because the arm domain is characteristic of ApTPx, the AM interaction is unique to ApTPx. In particular, the carbonyl oxygen of Thr191, the side-chain oxygen of Glu193, and the side-chain oxygens of Asp209 are involved in hydrogen bond networks with the next subunit [Fig. 1(f)]. These hydrogen bond networks stabilize the AM interaction. Assembly of the subunits of ApTPx is characterized by the large buried accessible surface area. The formation of a decameric ring of ApTPx results in a buried surface of 5391 Å2 per monomer (43.7% of the monomer surface). This proportion is significantly higher than those in other decameric Prxs (35.4, 37.0, and 29.7% for PrxII, AhpC, and TryP, respectively). These findings suggest that subunit­ subunit interactions are more dominant in ApTPx than in the mesophilic Prxs. Thermostable proteins often gain their stability through the formation of large com-

plexes.34,35 In this sense, the greater buried surface area would contribute to the hyperthermostability of ApTPx. The polypeptide of ApTPx (250 amino acids) is significantly larger than those of mesophilic Prxs ( 200 residues). Sequence alignment allowed assignment of an additional region of ApTPx as the C-terminal region [Fig. 2(a)]. The main-chain conformations in the N-terminal segment of the main domain are well conserved in these proteins, as a consequence of high homology between them [see legend to Fig. 2(a)]. However, the arm domain and the subsequent C-terminal segment are characteristic of ApTPx [Fig. 2(b)]. The characteristic C-terminal 7 of ApTPx is rich in polar residues and participates in intramolecular helix­ helix interactions. The arm domains contribute to

the interactions between dimers (the AM interactions). The AM interactions are not found in mesophilic decameric Prxs and thus are unique to ApTPx. These findings suggest that the characteristic arm domain strengthens the decamer formation of ApTPx. Ser207 (Cys in the wild-type) and Cys213 are located on 10 and 11 in the arm domain, respectively, the distance between the carbons being 4.2 Å. The closeness may enable the intramolecular disulfide bond formation between Cys207 and Cys213 in the wild-type at a particular stage in the reaction cycle. The behaviors of these SH groups of ApTPx during the reaction cycle remain unclear at present. In order to elucidate the behaviors of the SH groups, we are currently trying to determine the crystal structure of ApTPx in the oxidized form. Acknowledgments.
