The plant cell wall degrading enzymes expressed by anaerobic microorganisms form large multienzyme complexes (cellulosomes). Cellulosomes assemble by the Type I dockerins on the catalytic subunits binding to the reiterated Type I cohesins in the molecular scaffold, while Type II dockerin­cohesin interactions anchor the complex onto the bacterial cell surface. Type I and Type II cohesin, dockerin pairs show no cross-specificity. Here we report the crystal structure of the Type II cohesin (CohII) from the Clostridium thermocellum cell surface anchoring protein SdbA. The protein domain contains nine b-strands and a small a-helix. The b-strands assemble into two elongated b-sheets that display a typical jelly roll fold. The structure of CohII is very similar to Type I cohesins, and the dockerin binding site, which is centred at b-strands 3, 5 and 6, is likely to be conserved in the two proteins. Subtle differences in the topology of the binding sites and a lack of sequence identity in the b-strands that comprise the core of the dockerin binding site explain why Type I and Type II cohesins display such distinct specificities for their target dockerins.

hydrolases that display functional synergy but do not physically associate. In contrast, the corresponding enzymes synthesised by anaerobic microorganisms physically associate to form a large MDa hydrolytic complex known as the "cellulosome".1 The intimate association of the proteins within the cellulosome enhances the synergy between the various enzymes making this hydrolytic complex one of the most efficient plant cell wall degrading systems known. 2,3 Indeed the cellulosome represents an efficient mechanism for promoting enzyme cooperativity. Thus knowledge of the mechanism by which cellulosomes assemble and associate with microbial surfaces can be harnessed

910 in developing any nano-enzyme complexes in which the catalytic components display complementary activities. Studies on the Clostridium thermocellum plant cell wall degrading system have provided considerable insight into the mechanism by which the cellulosome assembles and associates with the bacterial cell wall. In this thermostable complex, the multifunctional scaffoldin (CipA) contains nine reiterated Type I cohesin domains that individually bind to 23-residue tandemly repeated Type I dockerin domains that are present on the various cellulosomal catalytic subunits (see Bayer et al.1 for a review). As there is no significant specificity between individual Type I cohesins and dockerins, each cellulosome comprises a different repertoire of nine hydrolases and thus the composition of these complexes is dictated by the level at which the various catalytic components are expressed. 4 Indeed, whilst the scaffoldin possesses just nine Type I cohesins, the genome of C. thermocellum has over 50 dockerin-containing open reading frames, at least 42 of which encode enzymes appended to dockerin domains. The assembly of cellulosomes onto the bacterial surface is orchestrated by three proteins, SdbA, Orf2p and OlpB, which are presumed to be tethered onto the C. thermocellum cell wall via N-terminal SLH domains.5,6 SdbA, Orf2p and OlpB contain Type II cohesins, which recruit the cellulosome onto the surface of the bacterial membrane by binding to the Type II dockerin present at the C terminus of CipA (Figure 1). Recently, the draft genome sequence of C. thermocellum provided the complete scenario of cellulosomal organisation by revealing in addition to SdbA, Orf2p and OlpB the presence of two novel proteins (accession numbers ZP312245 and ZP312218) each containing seven copies of Type II cohesins. The multiple Type II cohesin domains in several of these proteins contribute to polycellulosome assemblies. Collectively, the five anchoring proteins identified in the C. thermocellum genome contain 21 Type II cohesin domains, which contrasts to the single Type II dockerin in CipA (Figure 1). Comparison of the primary structure of C. thermocellum cohesins and dockerins reveals limited similarity between Type I and Type II

cohesins (w20%) and dockerins (w30%), 7 consistent with the lack of cross-specificity between Type I and Type II cohesin­dockerin pairs. Elucidation of the molecular determinants of cohesin-dockerin recognition is crucial to understanding the mechanism of cellulosome assembly. The crystal structures of several Type I C. thermocellum cohesins have been determined.8­10 The protein domains display similar folds comprising nine b-strands that form a flattened b-barrel with a typical jelly roll topology, while the NMR architecture of the Type I dockerin forms a non-standard paired EF hand structure.11 The subsequent structure of the Type I cohesin­dockerin complex provided valuable information about the atomic interactions that mediate complex assembly.12 Despite the preliminary "crystallisation report" of the structure of a Type II cohesin from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus,13 and the recent description of the crystal structure of a Type II cohesin from Bacteroides cellulosolvens,14 there remains a paucity of information on the mechanism of Type II dockerin­cohesin assemblies, especially with respect to the best studied organism C. thermocellum. The structure of the C. thermocellum Type II cohesin DNA encoding the cohesin domain of SdbA (residues 29­191), designated CohII, was amplified by PCR from C. thermocellum genomic DNA, using the following primer pairs: 5 0 -CTCGCTAGCGATA AAGCCTCGAGC-3 0 and 5 0 -CACCTCGAGATC CGGCTGTATTAC-3 0 , which contain NheI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined). The amplified DNA was cloned into the NheI and XhoI restriction sites of the expression vector pET21a (Novagen) to generate pCF1, in which the first three residues of CohII (MAS) are vector-encoded. BL21 cells, transformed with the pET21a derivative, were grown at 37 8C to A 600nm 0.5 and recombinant protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside and incubating for a further three hours at 37 8C. Protein was purified and crystallised as described in the Supplementary Data. The structure of CohII was initially solved using a

form two b-sheets aligned in an elongated b-barrel that displays a classical jelly roll fold (Figure 2(a)). The two sheets comprise b-strands 9 (Glu161 to Ile163), 1 (Ser8 to Phe13), 2 (Gly21 to Asn31), 7 (Ser114 to Ile124) and 4 (Leu50 to Val53) on one face and b-strands 5 (Ile81 to Ala84), 6 (Ile92 to Ala98), 3 (Ala37 to Val44) and 8 (Thr147 to Asp151) on the other face. The a-helix (Ile102 to Thr108) is located between b-strands 6 and 7. Strands 1 and 9 are aligned parallel to each other while the other b-strands are antiparallel.

912 A structural similarity search using DALI15 reveals that CohII is most similar to CohIIAc, the Type II cohesin of the A. cellulyticus cellulosomal ScaB subunit,13 with a root mean square deviation ° (rmsd) of 1.1 A over 159 residues. CohII is also similar to the Type I cohesin domains of C. thermo° cellum CipA with rmsd values of around 1.67 A for 103 equivalent residues for both the second and seventh cohesin domains (Figure 2(b)). CohII also displays a similar fold to many carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) located in families 2, 4, 6, 9, 15, 17, 22, 27, 28, 29, 32, 34, and 36, which also comprise two b-sheets that adopt a b-jelly roll fold (recently reviewed16). The similarity with family 2 CBMs is particularly striking as in these proteins the two b-sheets form an elongated b-barrel, similar to CohII. The similar fold displayed by CBM2s and both Type I and Type II cohesins is consistent with an evolutionary relationship between these proteins, indicating that they may have diverged from a common ancestral protein, and the extended surface on both the cohesins and CBMs have been tailored for selective protein and carbohydrate recognition, respectively. Comparison of Type I and Type II cohesins Despite low sequence similarity the three-dimensional structures of the Type II and Type I cohesins are very similar (Figure 2(b)). Both proteins consist

of two b-sheets comprising the same b-strands that essentially overlap in three-dimensional space. The major differences in the overall fold of the two proteins are as follows: b-strand 4 in CohII is smaller than the corresponding b-strand in Type I cohesins, and the loop connecting b-strands 4 and 5 is considerably longer in Type II than Type I cohesins. Indeed the first 17 residues of this loop in CohII, extending from Asp54 to Arg70, occupy a completely different position to the equivalent region of Type I cohesins, which comprises the C-terminal region of b-strand 5. The a-helix between b-strands 6 and 7 in CohII is absent in Type I cohesins. The final b-strand in Type I cohesins is interrupted by a short three amino acid residue loop, while b-strand 9 in CohII is much shorter and does not contain an internal region lacking secondary structure. Perhaps the three most functionally significant differences between the folds of Type I and Type II cohesins are the orientation of b-strands 8 and 5, and the loop connecting b-strands 7 and 8. In Type I cohesins b-strand 8 is in a planar orientation with the other b-strands that comprise this face of the protein. Thus, none of the amino acid residues in b-strand 8 contribute to ligand binding, which is centred around b-strands 3, 5 and 6. By contrast, b-strand 8 in CohII is tilted towards the other strands in the sheet and thus, as discussed below, some of the residues in this strand may contribute to dockerin

913 while the guanidino group of the arginine will make unfavourable contacts with Thr137 and Ser139 of CohII. It is possible that Ala28 in Type II dockerins, the equivalent residue to Arg23 in Type I dockerins,17 does not make unfavourable contacts with CohII as the amino acid is considerably smaller than arginine. Inspection of the presumed dockerin binding site (b-strands 3, 5 and 6) of CohII provides insight into the striking differences in ligand specificity displayed by Type I and Type II cohesins. While the electronic surface potential of the ligand binding site in Type I cohesins is predominantly negatively charged, the corresponding region of CohII carries a slight positive charge (Figure 3). Interestingly the face of CohII that does not interact with the dockerin is positively charged, which may facilitate its interaction with the negatively charged bacterial cell surface, and thus orientate the ligand binding b-sheet into solvent and prevent steric clashes between the cellulosome and the bacterial cell wall. This positively charged face is also evident in the Type I cohesin. Importantly, the three polar residues, Asn37, Asp39, and Glu131 in Type I cohesins that make direct hydrogen bonds with Ser45 and Thr46 of the cognate dockerin are not conserved in CohII, which is consistent with the absence of hydroxy amino acids in the equivalent

recognition. In CohII b-strand 8 is considerably shorter than the equivalent strand in Type I cohesins, while the loop connecting b-strands 7 and 8 is longer and displays a different conformation to the equivalent protein domains in CipA. Similar to the recently reported structure of the eleventh Type II cohesin from B. cellulosolvens, ° b-strand 5 is elevated by 2­4 A relative to the corresponding region of the C. thermocellum Type I cohesins. As previously indicated by Noach et al.,14 the ridge formed by b-strand 5 may influence the location of the bound dockerin relative to the corresponding Type I dockerin/cohesin complex. The recent solution of the Type I dockerin­cohesin complex12 provides insight into the mechanism by which the Type II cohesin­dockerin complex assembles. The dockerin binding site in the Type I cohesin consists of an essentially planar surface comprising b-strands 3, 5 and 6. Given the almost identical fold displayed by CohII and the Type I cohesin, it is highly likely that the location of the dockerin binding site in these two proteins is also conserved (Figure 2(b)). Indeed the structure of the Type I cohesin--dockerin complex overlaid with CohII yields few clashes. The backbone of Arg23 of the dockerin may clash with the side-chain of Asp85,

914 position in Type II dockerins.17,18 An overlap of CohII with the Type I cohesin/dockerin complex reveals that the side-chains (which are solvent-exposed) of the following amino acids on b-strands 3, 5 and 6 are likely to play a role in ligand recognition: Gln40, Asn42, Ile81, Ile83, Ile92, Asn94, Ala96 and Ala98. Interestingly b-strand 8, which comprises the final component of b-sheet 1, is tilted inwards such that the side-chains of Gln148 and Phe150 may well play a significant role in ligand binding. Finally Ser100, which contains a side-chain in double conformation, and is located in the loop between b-strand 6 and the single a-helix, may also contribute to ligand recognition. Further insight into the functional importance of amino acids on the surface of the putative binding site of CohII can be gained by comparing the primary sequence of the seven C. thermocellum Type II cohesin domains present in the proteins SbdA, OlpB and ORF26 (Figure 4). Gln40, Ile92, Asn94, and Pro141 are invariant, whereas Asn42, Thr137 and Phe150 are conserved in six, six and five in the other cohesins, respectively. These seven residues are also invariant or highly conserved in two putative C. thermocellum proteins (accession numbers ZP312245 and ZP312218) that both contain seven Type II cohesin domains (data not shown). As Type II cohesin domains in SbdA, OlpB and ORF2 have been shown to bind to the Type II dockerin from CipA,6 it is likely that the ligand specificity of the C. thermocellum Type II cohesins is essentially identical. Thus one would predict that the amino acids that interact with the cognate dockerin are highly conserved, as occurs in the nine Type I cohesins in CipA, that all bind to Type I dockerins.1 Thus, we predict that Gln40, Asn42, Ile92, Asn94, Thr137, Pro141 and Phe150 (Figure 2(c)), play a key role in binding the Type II dockerin in CipA and thus in assembling the cellulosome on the surface of C. thermocellum. In addition to using a sequence-based approach to identify key residues involved in dockerin recognition, comparing the three-dimensional structure of CohII with the Type II cohesin from A. cellulyticus (CohIIAc) also provides insight into the identity of these amino acids. An overlap of the two structures (Figure 2(c)), shows that the spatial location of the following residues in CohII and CohIIAc (residues shown in parenthesis) are conserved: Gln40 (Gln38), Asn42 (Asn40), Asp85 (Asp81), Ile92 (Ile88), Asn94 (Asn90), Thr137 (Thr132), Pro141 (Pro137) and Phe150 (Phe146). Thus, all the amino acid residues that are invariant or highly conserved in C. thermocellum Type II cohesins, are also conserved in the A. cellulyticus Type II cohesin. These comparisons not only provide further insight into the residues in CohII that are likely to play a key role in ligand binding, but also indicate that the mechanism of Type II cohesin-dockerin recognition is highly conserved across different bacterial species. The functional importance of these conserved amino acids is currently under investigation.
