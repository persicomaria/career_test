In a previous paper, 2H -deoxy-N6-methoxyadenosine (mo6A) was shown to form a mismatch base-pair with 2H -deoxycytidine with a Watson-Cricktype geometry. To fully understand the structural basis of genetic mutations with damaged DNA, it is necessary to examine whether the methoxylated adenine residue still has the ability to form the regular Watson-Crick pairing with a thymine residue. Therefore, a DNA dodecamer with the sequence d(CGCGmo6AATTCGCG) has been synthesized and its crystal structure determined. The methoxylation has no signi®cant effect on the overall DNA conformation, which is that of a standard Bform duplex. The methoxylated adenine moieties adopt the amino tautomer with an anti conformation around the C6-N6 bond to the N1 atom, and they form a Watson-Crick base-pair with thymine residues on the opposite strand, similar to an unmodi®ed adenine residue. It is concluded that methoxylated adenine can present two alternate faces for base-pairing, thanks to the amino 6 imino tautomerism allowed by methoxylation. Based on this property, two gene transition routes are proposed.

Introduction
Genetic information is transmitted from generation to generation through DNA replication, in which a new complementary strand is synthesized starting from either strand of an original DNA duplex. In this process, the highest accuracy is achieved by forming Watson-Crick base-pairs between adenine and thymine bases and between guanine and cytosine bases, as an absolute rule in every organism. When DNA is attacked with certain chemicals, however, this rule is disturbed and

errors are introduced into the synthesized DNA. As a result, genetic mutations will occur. These chemicals are called mutagens (Singer & Kusmierek, 1982). As mutations can lead to several diseases, including cancer, extensive studies on mutagens have been performed. Oxyamines such as hydroxylamine and methoxylamine are known to be mutagens (Singer & Kusmierek, 1982) which predominantly attack and modify the exocyclic amino groups of nucleic acid bases (Kochetkov & Budowsky, 1969). Substitution at the N6 amino groups of adenine bases has been established (Budowsky et al., 1975), and is thought to be the origin of the observed mutations. It is expected that the N6-methoxyadenine moiety has different chemical and physicochemical properties from the unmodi®ed base. When a DNA fragment containing 2H -deoxy-N6-methoxyadenosine (hereafter designated as mo6A) is used as a template, the non-complementary 2H -deoxycytidine 5H -triphosphate (dCTP) as well as the complementary thymidine 5H -triphosphate (TTP) are incorporated by

In addition, free 2H -deoxyadenosine 5H -triphosphate (dATP), which is a reactant to be incorporated in the synthesized DNA, is also modi®ed by oxyamines (Singer, 1975). Methoxylated dATP (hereafter designated as mo6dATP) is incorporated at both templates, 2H deoxycytidine and thymidine (Singer & Spengler, 1982; Abdul-Maish & Bessman, 1986; Hill et al., 1998). The DNA polymerase accepts only WatsonCrick base-pairs, therefore it is plausible that methoxylation allows the adenine moiety to form

Watson-Crick-type pairs with both thymine and cytosine. Indeed, we recently determined the crystal structure of a DNA dodecamer with the nucleotide sequence d(CGCGmo6AATCCGCG) (hereafter designated as Dmo6A ÁC), and found that the mo6A residue forms a Watson-Crick-type pair with cytosine residues in B-form duplex DNA (Chatake et al., 1999). The adenine moiety has the imino tautomeric form, with the methoxy group in the anti conformation around the C6-N6 bond to the N1 atom.

1225 Material (Tables 1 and 2, respectively). The crystal structure is isomorphous to the original dodecamer with the sequence d(CGCGAATTCGCG) (Dickerson et al., 1981; Shui et al., 1998), and to the modi®ed (``damaged'') dodecamer reported in the previous paper (Chatake et al., 1999). Similar to those structures, two duplexes related by 21 symmetry along the c-axis form columns in a head-totail fashion. To connect them, two inter-duplex base-pairs are formed through N2-H Á Á Á N3 hydrogen bonds between Ga12 and Ga2, and between Gb2 and Gb12 (see Figure 2 by Chatake et al., 1999). An octahedrally hydrated magnesium cation is located in the major groove of each duplex. Three of the bound water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the O6 and N7 atoms of Ga2 and Gb10 and the other three are hydrogen bonded to the phosphate oxygen atoms of Aa6, and Ta7, in another duplex, related by 21 symmetry along the b-axis. This situation is the same as that found in the Dmo6A ÁC crystal (see Figure 4 by Chatake et al., 1999). Effect of methoxylation on DNA conformation The structures of both Dmo6A Á T (Figure 1(a)) and Dmo6A ÁC (Figure 1(b)) are similar to that of the original dodecamer (Figure 1(c)). The overall root-mean-square displacement of non-hydrogen Ê Ê atoms is 0.31 A for Dmo6A Á T and 0.31 A for Dmo6A Á C, when they are superimposed on the original dodecamer. Figure 2 shows plots of some representative helical parameters along the nucleotide sequence. These parameters ¯uctuate around average values close to those of typical B-form

sine (Birnbaum et al., 1984) also indicate that the N6-methoxylated base takes the imino form, although with the methoxy group in the syn conformation. In solution, however, these derivatives are in equilibrium between the imino form and the amino form (Stolarski et al., 1984), the latter being preferred by the unmodi®ed adenine base (Wolfenden, 1969). To understand the structural basis of the mutation mechanism, it is necessary to con®rm that the methoxylated adenine residue can adopt the amino tautomer, and that it still has the ability to form a canonical Watson-Crick pair with a thymine residue. For this purpose, we have synthesized a DNA dodecamer with the sequence d(CGCGmo6AATTCGCG) (Dmo6A ÁT) and determined its crystal structure. Electron density maps clearly show that the mo6A residue does indeed form Watson-Crick-type pairs with thymine residues in the B-form duplex. This demonstrates the existence of two alternate faces of the methoxylated 2H -deoxyadenosine through the amino 6 imino tautomerism, allowing its base-pairing with either 2H -deoxycytidine or thymidine, and indicates several possible gene transition mechanisms.

Results and Discussion

N6-Methoxyadenine for Watson-Crick Base-pairings

Hydrogen-bonding scheme of mo6A Figure 3 shows 2jFoj À jFcj maps at the two sites of the mo6A residues. Each N6-methoxyadenine moiety forms a pair with the thymine base on the opposite strand. It is noteworthy that the geometry of the pairing is essentially the same as the usual Watson-Crick adenine Áthymine pair. The methoxy groups of the mo6A bases take an anti conformation with respect to the N1 atom around the C6N6 bond, like those found in the Dmo6A ÁC crystal (Chatake et al., 1999). The hydrogen bond distances and angles in the base-pairs are given in Table 1: those of the other hydrogen bonds are in the Supplementary Material (Table 3). The distances between the N6 (mo6Aa5) and O4 (Tb8) atoms and between the N1 (mo6Aa5) and N3 (Tb8) atoms, and the corresponding distances in the mo6Ab5 ÁTa8 pair, indicate that mo6A can form a base-pair through hydrogen bonds with thymine just like the unmodi®ed adenine residue. In the Dmo6A ÁC crystal, a Watson-Crick-like mo6A Á C pairing was

A comparison of some representative helical parameters in Dmo6A Á T (triangles), Dmo6A Á C (Chatake et al., 1999) (circles) and the original dodecamer (Dickerson et al., l981; Shui et al., 1998) (boxes). The top, middle and bottom diagrams represent the helical rise, the helical twist angles and the displacements, respectively, of the three duplexes. They are plotted along the nucleotide sequence to show their ¯uctuations. These parameters were calculated by the program NUPARM (Bansal et al., 1995). In the right shaded column, their average values are indicated, together with the typical ones for standard A and B-form DNA (Arnot & Hukins, 1972).

DNA, and their variations along the sequence are almost the same, even at the mo6A residues, indicating that methoxylation of adenine residues does not signi®cantly affect the overall DNA conformation. The X-ray structure (Kiefer et al., 1998) of a large fragment of DNA polymerase I from Bacillus stearothermophilus, complexed with DNA primer and template strands, shows that the two DNA strands form a duplex with a B-form conformation in the polymerase active site. In addition, there is an open, solvent-accessible space in the major groove of the bound DNA. Therefore, when adenine bases in DNA are methoxylated, the damaged DNA can still adopt an acceptable conformation in the polymerase, and the methoxy group will not interfere with the binding.

found (Chatake et al., 1999). When both the mo6A ÁT pair and the mo6A Á C pair are superimposed on the canonical A ÁT pair found in the original dodecamer (Dickerson et al., 1981; Shul et al., 1998), the base positions are almost the same. In other words, the methoxylated adenine base can form a pair with either thymine or cytosine bases in the same geometry as a Watson-Crick pair, with no signi®cant changes in atomic positions. Therefore, these pairings can be accepted as WatsonCrick pairs in the polymerase (Kiefer et al., 1998). Tautomerism of mo6A and base-pairing In the crystalline state, only the imino form has been found in N6-methoxyadenine derivatives (Fujii et al., 1990; Birnbaum et al., 1984). The imino form is also preferred in the Dmo6A ÁC crystal, forming a Watson-Crick-type base-pair with a cytosine residue (Chatake et al., 1999). In the present Dmo6A ÁT crystal, however, to form the observed base-pairs with thymine residues, the chemical structure of the methoxylated adenine base must be the amino form, as shown in Figure 4. An unmodi®ed adenine base almost always exists in the amino form, its tautomerization occurring very rarely (Wolfenden, 1969). The existence of either tautomer of mo6A in the crystalline state, depending on the base in the opposite strand, is consistent with the fact that in solution, an equilibrium is observed between the amino and the imino forms (Stolarski et al., 1984), the ratio between the two tautomers being a function of the polarity of the solution. Furthermore, when a cytosine derivative is added to a solution containing an mo6A derivative, the imino form increases in population, and when a uridine derivative is added, the amino form increases (Stolarski et al., 1987). Therefore, it is concluded that it is the formation of a Watson-Crick-type base-pair with either 2H -deoxycytidine or thymidine that stabilizes one or the other tautomer. The difference in total energy between the two tautomers and the stabilization energy on basepairing were calculated by the molecular orbital method (see Figure 5). When 9-methyl-N6-methoxyadenine is alone in vacuum, the amino form is more stable than the imino form, as in a hydrophobic solution. But when mo6A makes a base-pair with thymine or with cytosine in the Watson-Crick type, the resulting base-pairs are stabilized at almost the same level, consistent with the results of

the present X-ray analyses that 2H -deoxy-N6-methoxyadenosine can form a base-pair with either thymidine or 2H -deoxycytidine. In summary, when a thymine residue is located on the opposite site in a DNA duplex, mo6A takes the amino tautomer and behaves like an unmodi®ed adenine, forming a base-pair with the thymidine. On the other hand, when a cytosine residue is located on the opposite strand, as discussed in the previous paper for Dmo6A ÁC, the mo6A residue takes the imino form and behaves like a 2H deoxyguanosine, forming a base-pair with the two hydrogen bonds between N1 (mo6A) and N3 (C) and between N6 (mo6A) and N4 (C). The existence of such ``alternate faces'' of 2H -deoxy-N6-methoxyadenosine in base-pairing points clearly to a possible mutation mechanism, discussed below. Biological implication The possibility of two alternate faces of N6-methoxyadenine is applicable to adenine residues in template DNA strands and to dATP as a reactant being incorporated during DNA replication. Considering with successive replication steps, possible routes of gene transition are shown in Figure 6.

Change in total energy between the two tautomers (upper half) and their stabilization energies on base-pairing (lower half) with 1-methylthymine (left) and with 1-methylcytosine (right), from molecular orbital calculations. To construct initial model structures, atomic coordinates of adenosine, b-cytidine, 1-(2-deoxyb-D-ribofuranosyl)-5-methyluracil, N6-methoxy-2H ,3H ,5H -triO-methyladenosine and 11-methoxygelsemamide were obtained from the CSD ®le (Cambridge Structural Database System). The geometry of the Watson-Crick type pairing was obtained from those of the 9-(2-carboxyethyl)-guanine:1-methylcytosine complex (Fujita et al., 1984) and the 9-ethyladenine:1-methyluracil complex (Cambridge Structural Database System). The ribose of each nucleotide was replaced with a methyl group to save computer time. The atomic coordinates were optimized using a 3-21G basic set by the ab initio method with the program Gaussian94 (Frisch et al., 1995).

Figure 6. A gene transition mechanism. There are two possible routes, which occur when (a) the template adenosine residue on DNA is methoxylated and when (b) dATP, which is a reactant for DNA replication, is methoxylated.

When an adenine base in DNA is methoxylated, the original A ÁT pair can be replaced by a G ÁC pair after two steps. In the ®rst step, if dCTP is incorporated instead of TTP at the methoxylated adenine residue, then dGTP can be incorporated at the 2H -deoxycytidine site in the second step. In the case of mo6dATP incorporation, A ÁT to GÁ C and G ÁC to A ÁT mutations are possible with three replication steps. In the A ÁT 3 G ÁC case, if mo6dATP is incorporated at the template thymine residue by forming a mo6A Á T pair, then the incorporated mo6A residue will next accept dCTP by mimicking G; ®nally, dGTP will be incorporated at

the cytosine residue of the second template. In the G ÁC 3 A ÁT case, if mo6dATP is incorporated at the template cytosine residue by mimicking G, then the incorporated mo6A residue will accept TTP; ®nally dATP will be incorporated at the template thymine residue.

Experimental Procedures
Synthesis and crystallization DNA dodecamer of Dmo6A ÁT was synthesized and crystallized in the same way as that reported in the previous paper (Chatake et al., 1999). A reservoir solution containing 25 % (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 18 mM magnesium acetate, 6 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride, 80 mM sodium chloride and 10 mM sodium cacodylate at pH 7.0 was used.

N6-Methoxyadenine for Watson-Crick Base-pairings Data collection To prevent nucleation and growth of hexagonal ice, the crystals were bathed in a reservoir solution containing 35 % (v/v) MPD for one minute before ¯ash freezing. X-ray data were collected at 110 K on the Sakabe-Weissenberg camera (Sakabe, 1991) with synchrotron radiation at the Photon Factory (BL-6B) in Tsukuba. To compensate the blind region, another crystal with a different orientation was used at 100 K. The two sets of diffraction patterns were processed by the program DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997), and intensity data of a total of 28,875 observed re¯ections were merged by the programs SCALA and AGROVATA in CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994) into 7518 independent re¯ections with Rmerge of 3.6 %. The completeness of the data was 79.7 % in the Ê 100 $ 1.6 A resolution range and 59.5 % for the outer Ê 1.67 $ 1.60 A resolution shell. The unit cell dimensions Ê Ê Ê are a  25.5 A, b  39.8 A and c  66.5 A, the space group being P212121. Statistics of data collection and crystal data are given in Table 2. Structure determination The initial structure was determined by the molecular replacement method, using the structure of the original DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) (Shui et al., 1998) with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). To

1229
inspect the molecular structure and to add water molecules, the programs O (Jones et al., 1991) and QUANTA (distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.) were used. Taking the hydrogen-bonding scheme into consideration, the mo6A bases were assumed to have an amino form. È For X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992a) re®nement, the stereochemical parameters of the amino form of mo6A were derived by combination of the structures of an unmodi®ed 2H -deoxy-adenosine and the methoxy group of 11methoxygelseamide (Lin et al., 1989). A combination of simulated annealing and positional re®nements was applied, followed by interpretation of omit maps at every nucleotide residue. One magnesium cation hydrated octahedrally and one spermine molecule was found, and 126 water molecules were assigned. During structural re®nement, no constraints were applied between the paired mo6A and thymidine residues. The Ê ®nal R-factor was 21.1 % for 5.0 $ 1.6 A resolution data (Rfree  27.0 % for 10 % of the observed data). Statistics of the structure determination are summarized in Table 2. Data Bank accession code The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) (entry code BD0010).
