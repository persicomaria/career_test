The Structure of Antirrhinum Centroradialis Protein (CEN) Suggests a Role as a Kinase Regulator
M. J. Banfield* and R. L. Brady*
Department of Biochemistry University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TD, UK Expression of the plant protein centroradialis (CEN) leads to a morphological switch between shoot growth and the development of ¯ower structures (in¯orescence). We have determined the crystal structure of Ê Antirrhinum CEN to 1.9 A resolution. This structure con®rms the CEN proteins as a subset of the family of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBP), as predicted from sequence homology. Mammalian forms of PEBP have been found to act as inhibitors of MAP kinase signalling, a central signalling cascade regulating cell differentiation. CEN and PEBP proteins share a similar topology dominated by a large central bsheet. The strong conservation of a binding pocket at one end of this sheet which is capable of binding phosphoryl ligands, suggests the biological effects of CEN, like PEBP, arise from the ability of this region to form complexes with phosphorylated ligands, hence interfering with kinases and their effectors.

Introduction
Unlike most higher organisms, plants retain an ability to develop new organs after embryogenesis. In their above-ground architecture, for example, plants can respond to environmental stimuli by switching between the production of shoots for further growth, or initiating the development of ¯owers (in¯orescence). These traits have important agronomic consequences, as improvements in the uniformity of commercial crop growth and quality can lead to considerable ®nancial advantages. The ongoing ability of plants to respond to both endogenous and environmental signals throughout their lifespan also provides an interactive and accessible model in which to study factors regulating organism development. A variety of genes in several plant species have been identi®ed whose protein products regulate the development of plant architecture. Growth of

lateral shoots, for example, has been linked to the inclusion of the Teosinte Branched (TB1) Doebley et al., 1997) and Lateral Suppressor (LS) (Schumacher et al., 1999) genes in maize and tomato respectively. The orthologous genes Floricaula (FLO) in Antirrhinum (snapdragon) and Leafy (LFY) and the ¯oral inducer FT in Arabidopsis promote the development of ¯owers over shoots (Weigel et al., 1992; Bradley et al., 1996; 1997). Intriguingly, another family of genes has also been identi®ed which act as antagonists to FLO and LFY; Centroradialis (CEN), Self-pruning (SP) and Terminal Flower 1 (TFL1) promote the emergence of shoots rather than ¯owers (Amaya et al., 1999; Pnueli et al., 1998; Ohshima et al., 1997). Although the generality and interdependence of these gene pairs has yet to be established, studies of the molecular functions of these gene products should provide a rare insight to the interplay between molecular switches and gross organism development. Proteins encoded by the orthologous CEN, SP and TFL1 genes and their antagonists LFY and FT (all hereinafter called the CEN family) share sequence similarity (Figure 1) with the mammalian phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBP, also recently referred to as Raf1 Kinase Inhibitor Protein-RKIP). These mammalian proteins were originally named for their ability to bind phospholipids in vitro (Grandy et al., 1990; Schoentgen & Jolles, 1995), and are prevalent in a wide range of

biological tissues (Seddiqi et al., 1994), although their direct function has until recently remained unclear. The PEBP proteins are believed to be the precursor of hippocampal neurostimulatory peptide (HCNP), a bioactive peptide that comprises the ®rst 12 amino acid residues of PEBP, and which has been shown to play an important role in the development of the hippocampus (Tohdoh et al., 1995). Very recently, PEBP (RKIP) has been demonstrated to be a regulator of the central Raf1/MEK/ERK signalling pathway (Yeung et al., 1999). This MAP kinase pathway commonly transmits differentiation signals to a variety of cell types (Ferrell, 1996; Morrison & Cutler, 1997). Yeung et al. (1999) suggested PEBP exerts its effects by inhibiting phosphorylation of Raf-1, with which PEBP is believed to form a complex, hence disrupting the interaction between Raf-1 and MEK. Similarly, a number of molecular targets for the tomato SP orthologue have been identi®ed with a two-hybrid screen (E. Lifschitz & L. Pneuli, personal communication) and include a serine-threonine kinase. These observations suggest that the CEN proteins may regulate in¯orescence in plants via interaction with a kinase signalling pathway. Crystal structures of human (hPEBP) and bovine (bPEBP) forms of PEBP were recently simultaneously reported (Ban®eld et al., 1998; Serre et al., 1998). These have de®ned a novel, largely b-fold topology for the PEBP family, characterised by a

large central b-sheet. Both this sheet and a subsidiary smaller b-sheet are composed of antiparallel strands arranged as two Greek-key motifs (Serre et al., 1998). Structures of complexes with phosphorylethanolamine (Serre et al., 1998) and the phosphate mimic cacodylate (Ban®eld et al., 1998) have identi®ed a highly conserved phosphatebinding site embedded within the structure, and this region has been identi®ed as crucial for the inhibitory activity of PEBP on Raf-1 (K. Yeung, personal communication). From these structures, access to the phosphate-binding site appears to be in part regulated by a carboxy-terminal helix. Additionally, we have speculated that the aminoterminal HCNP peptide may be liberated through autocatalysis, a process that is perhaps mediated by ligand binding. Although proteins of the PEBP family display remarkable sequence homology across a wide range of species (Figure 1), the plant CEN homologues form a distinctive subset and it has not been clear whether they share a common functionality with their mammalian PEBP counterparts. A clear relationship has been demonstrated in a range of plants between morphological changes in plant architecture and the production of CEN family proteins. The close relationship between the CEN proteins and meristem development in their host plants provides an intriguing opportunity to examine organism development at the molecular level.

1161 Figure 2(a)) includes 161 residues (labelled from Val1 to Glu174). Both chain termini regions from each molecule are poorly ordered within the crystal lattice. No electron density is observed for 12 residues at the N terminus and ®ve residues at the C terminus of the A-chain, and for four residues at the N terminus and six residues at the C terminus of the B-chain. Additionally, amino acid residues in the 30-32C and 129-144 loops are poorly ordered in both molecules. Nonetheless, the observed electron density for the remainder of each molecule is of high quality and a representative section is shown in Figure 3. The structures of each of the two molecules within the asymmetric unit closely resemble one Ê another with an rms deviation of 0.17 A for 136 a equivalent C atom positions. This, in part, re¯ects the non-crystallographic restraints applied to 122 core residues during re®nement. However, there are signi®cant differences in overall conformation between the two molecules at the N terminus, the loop between 30-32C, a loop between residues 58 and 62 where a re-orientation is observed, the start and end of the 129-144 loop, and the C terminus. Because of the close similarity of the two independent molecules all comparisons and discussion will be based on the B-chain of CEN, unless otherwise mentioned. Dimer formation in the CEN crystal In the crystal structure of CEN the two molecules of the asymmetric unit are covalently linked through a disulphide bond formed between residues A145Cys and B145Cys. This exposed disulphide is unlikely to be formed in the reducing environment within the cytoplasm of cells where CEN is believed to be active. However, the absence of oligomeric aggregates in recombinant preparations of CEN suggests discrete dimerisation may precede formation of the disulphide, and hence that a similar non-covalently associated dimer might predominate within the cytoplasm. Ê Ê Some 1223 A2 of surface area (703 A2 hydrophobic Ê 2 hydrophilic, calculated with QUANTA and 519 A in the absence of protons) are buried within this dimer, which is likely to be suf®cient to stabilise this oligomer in the absence of a disulphide. However, although dimers of hPEBP and bPEBP have been described in the crystal structures of these proteins, all three proposed PEBP/CEN dimers differ in their assembly patterns (Figure 4). This argues against a dimer being the biologically active form. Additionally, formation of the CEN dimer observed within the crystal structure blocks access to the putative phosphate-binding site (see later), again suggesting the observed dimer may not be functionally relevant. Nevertheless, the variety of plausible dimer structures displayed within PEBP/ CEN crystal lattices may mimic association patterns of PEBP homologues with a range of effector molecules, or perhaps as a component of an assembled complex.

In this study we have determined the ®rst crystal structure of a plant PEBP homologue, CEN from Antirrhinum (garden snapdragon). This crystal structure con®rms the clear structural similarity of CEN and PEBP proteins. A comparison of the structures of the plant and mammalian proteins highlights the core features of the PEBP fold. The striking conservation of a ligand-binding site and accessory features strongly supports the notion that the CEN and PEBP proteins share a common biological function, as regulators of cell differentiation effected by interaction with a kinase cascade.

Results and Discussion
Sequence comparison PEBP proteins are, in general, highly conserved. This is particularly evident with a comparison of all ®ve mammalian PEBPs that have been sequenced (human, cow, monkey, rat and mouse) and which display greater than 90 % amino acid identity (Figure 1). By comparison, Antirrhinum CEN has only 44 identities ($24 %) with hPEBP. There are several regions of notable sequence homology which have been described for the mammalian PEBPs (Ban®eld et al., 1998; Serre et al., 1998), and these same regions account for much of the conserved sequence between hPEBP and CEN. These include a D-P-D-x-P motif which runs from residue 70 to 74, a histidine residue at position 86, and a G-x-H-R motif between residues 116 and 119. From the structures of hPEBP, bPEBP and CEN, each of these regions is shown to contribute to the conformation of the ligand binding site. Greater variation in sequence similarity is observed when the subset of plant CEN proteins are compared with one another, with pairwise comparisons showing sequence identity in the range of 4080 %. This partially re¯ects the more diverse range of the proteins being compared (for example, FT and TFL1 from Arabidopsis are antagonists, (Kardailsky et al., 1999)) but still indicates a substantial level of overall conservation. The cytochrome c family, for example, which is generally accepted as a highly conserved evolutionary family, typically shows invariance of about 40 % of its residues. These comparisons lend further support to the notion that PEBP proteins form a central component in a ubiquitous and important biochemical pathway. Crystal structure of CEN There are two molecules of CEN per asymmetric unit within the crystal structure. Although there are 181 amino acid residues in the mature protein, only 154 amino acid residues (labelled Gly9 to Thr175) could be modelled for molecule A, these being numbered to correspond with the hPEBP sequence (see Figure 1). Similarly, the model for the second molecule (labelled chain B, shown in

The amino and carboxy termini are labelled N and C, respectively, and the side-chain for His86 is shown yellow. The Figure was prepared with BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997).

Another feature noted in the hPEBP structure was the prominence of a distinctive dipole moment which was proposed to orient the protein with respect to possible membrane association. The predominantly positive end of the molecule, most likely to associate with the negatively charged inner membrane leaf, also correlated with the putative phosphate-binding site being available for phospholipid headgroup association. This trend is not observed in CEN where the predominant dipole is of similar magnitude (242 Debye, compared with 174 Debye for hPEBP) but orthogonal in direction. Although proteins in this family have been observed and noted for their ability to bind phospholipid headgroups, the CEN structure is less consistent with this providing a means of membrane-association.

Comparison of CEN with hPEBP and bPEBP The recognisable sequence homology between hPEBP and CEN is re¯ected in the similarity of their overall folds. An overlay of the structure of Ê CEN with hPEBP gives an rmsd of 1.1 A for 109 a equivalent C atoms (Figure 2(b)). As with hPEBP and bPEBP, the dominant feature of the CEN fold is a large, central b-sheet formed from ®ve antiparallel strands (Figure 2(a)). The small sixth strand observed in the hPEBP and bPEBP structures forms a loop in CEN. Serre et al. (1998) have described the bPEBP fold in terms of two Greekkey motifs with a C-terminal aba element. The Greek-key motifs are again observed in CEN, but with one of the strands (that actually forms a loop in CEN, as described above) of the ®rst motif being

found in the large sheet, and the remainder in the smaller, subsidiary b-sheet. Except for the absence of the C-terminal elements, the topological arrangement of secondary structure in CEN follows closely that described previously for hPEBP (Ban®eld et al., 1998). Superimposing the 32 equivalent Ca positions in the dominant central sheet from CEN and hPEBP (residues 64-72, 84-91, 118-126 and 164-171) gives Ê an rms deviation of 0.58 A. A notable feature of the central b-sheet is the predominance of hydrophobic side-chains protruding from both sides. This re¯ects its central location within the CEN fold, where it is sandwiched between the small sheet formed by three short bordering strands on one side, and a short strand plus two helical segments on the opposite side. The fundamental importance of the central b-sheet is re¯ected in the high level of structural homology observed for this region between all three PEBP/CEN structures, whereas the arrangement and existence of the ¯anking sheet and helices differs considerably. For example, there is a signi®cant change in the angular association of the smaller sheet relative to the larger sheet when the CEN structure is compared to hPEBP. The smaller sheet in CEN is rotated by about 15  relative to its position in hPEBP. Additionally, the ¯anking a-helices differ markedly between the structures in their relative orientations to the central b-sheet. Conformational differences

are also apparent in loop regions that connect secondary structure elements, most signi®cantly the 91-101 and 110-117 loops. Finally, there are many small conformational changes that can be attributed to the disordered regions in the CEN structure. Taken together all these features highlight the nonessential nature of many of these peripheral secondary structure elements, and account for the considerable dif®culty experienced in solving the CEN structure by molecular replacement using PEBP coordinates. Analysis of the hPEBP and bPEBP structures in complex with phosphate and arsenate ligands (Serre et al, 1998; Ban®eld et al., 1998) has been used to locate a putative ligand-binding site in PEBP. It has also been noted that this region corresponds to the regions of highest sequence conservation. Although the structure of CEN, described here, is not in complex with phosphate (the site is ®lled with solvent molecules), replication of virtually all of the key features of this site implies a similar role for this region in CEN. In one crystal form of bPEBP a phosphoryl head group is bound in a pocket at one end of the central b-sheet. An array of residues form a complex of ligands for the phosphate group: these include Asp70, His86, Tyr120, and the main-chain amino group of Gly110 (numbering as per hPEBP). These residues are also involved in the binding of the cacodylate ion (a phosphate mimic) in the ligand-bound hPEBP

Each structure is shown as a Ca trace, with the highly conserved histidine (His86) in the ligand-binding site (yellow). CEN, green; hPEBP, red; and bPEBP, blue.

structure. The spatial arrangement of this cluster of residues is carefully preserved in CEN (Figure 5), where the only change is the loss of the hydroxyl group at position 120 which is a Phe residue. This loss appears to be compensated for on the opposite side of the pocket where histidine replaces tryptophan at position 84, the latter unable to ligand with phosphate in hPEBP because of its orientation. This substitution also argues against phosphate binding leading to phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue, consistent with the lack of experimental evidence for direct kinase activity being associated with PEBP family proteins. The conformation of the main chain in the vicinity of Gly110, a critical feature of the ligand-binding site, appears to be restrained by an adjacent Pro-Pro sequence. This conformation differs in CEN, where the Gly residue is replaced by an Arg residue. However, the position of this residue is also restrained by proline residues on either side, leaving the mainchain amine group in a location favourable for ligand formation. Although the precise details of the surrounding donors vary between CEN and PEBP, it appears extremely likely that this same region in CEN is arranged for the handling of phosphoryl-like ligands.

Whilst the conformation of the speci®c residues involved in binding phosphoryl and phosphoryllike ligands are well conserved between the structures, there are differences in the surrounding regions. Structurally, the most signi®cant of these is the deletion of two residues in the CEN structure (113 and 114) relative to hPEBP and bPEBP. These residues are present on a loop that lines one side of the binding pocket, and the conformation of this loop differs between CEN and the PEBP structures. This loop also interacts with the region containing the conserved D-P-D-x-P motif, which in turn is slightly displaced. A further signi®cant change is observed in the conformation of the long, external 129-145 loop. The C-terminal end of this loop, which differs in its placement in CEN relative to the PEBPs, is adjacent to the binding site. In CEN however, this conformation may be affected by the intermolecular A145-Cys:B145-Cys disulphide bond. Additionally, much of the loop prior to this position is disordered in the CEN crystal lattice. We note, however, that as this exposed loop is ®ve residues shorter in CEN compared to PEBP, a different orientation would be expected. These changes on the periphery of the ligand-binding site may re¯ect adaptations to species-speci®c protein

partners presenting a phosphoryl ligand, and argue against a homogeneous, common adhering species such as a bilipid membrane. In both the hPEBP and bPEBP structures, access to the ligand-binding appears to be partially regu-

lated by a C-terminal amphipathic helix. This helix is absent from the CEN structure, where the corresponding residues are disordered within the crystal lattice. However, this may be an artefact of the covalent dimer present in the crystals. Formation

1166 of this dimer obscures the entrance to the ligandbinding site and would require displacement of a putative helix for assembly. A comparison of the PEBP and CEN structures con®rms the deformability of this region of the fold, supporting the notion that this helical region may act to regulate access to the binding site. Removal of residues in this region enhances the interaction between RKIP (hPEBP) and Raf-1 (K. Yeung, personal communication), an observation consistent with these truncated forms displaying improved access to the ligand-binding site. This may mimic the CEN subset proteins, which are generally truncated at the C terminus in comparison to the mammalian PEBPs (Figure 1). In common with the PEBP structures, CEN has a non-prolyl cis-peptide bond between Arg82 and Glu83. The strict conservation of this unusual feature, which is located right at the entrance to the ligand binding site, implies this very unfavourable peptide orientation must be essential to the function of these proteins and in the maintenance of the protein fold. This is supported by the identi®cation of a naturally-occurring mutant in Arabidopsis, which develops a single terminal ¯ower, and which is believed to result from a Glu83 3 Lys substitution in the Arabidopsis CEN protein (Bradley et al, 1997). The Glu side-chain at position 83 appears to favour the cis conformation by acting as a proton acceptor in a charged hydrogen bond with the neighbouring amine portion of the 151 amide bond. A positively-charged lysine substitution in this position is unable to act as an acceptor, and it seems unlikely that the cis peptide bond conformation would be retained. This change in conformation clearly effects the functioning of CEN in the Arabidopsis mutant. We have noted that in the structure of hPEBP a series of highly conserved residues appear to form a direct link between the ligand binding site and the scissile Leu12 to Ser13 peptide bond. Cleavage of this bond in rat and human PEBP appears to be the source of the bioactive hippocampal neurostimulatory peptide (Tohdoh et al., 1995). Although this peptide bond is located near the surface of the protein, and hence potentially accessible to an appropriate protease, a series of invariant residues suggest a mechanism for autocatalysis. In hPEBP Arg119, which is universally conserved in the protein family, forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond (Leu12 to Ser13). Arg119 also makes contact with the ligand binding site through Asp72 (the universally conserved second Asp residue of the D-P-D-x-P motif) making a strong salt-bridge contact with this residue, His118 (conserved in all but one member of the family) and Tyr120. Finally, the cis orientation of the peptide bond between Arg82 and Glu83 locates the side-chain of Arg82 in the region of potential cleavage. Although no equivalent of HCNP has been reported in plants, intriguingly all of these features also exist in the structure of CEN. The intimate and highly conserved precise arrange-

ment of these residues suggests a route for the transmission of a signal through these molecules to accompany ligand binding. Functional implications of the CEN structure It is clear from both sequence comparisons and this structural analysis that proteins of the CEN family form a subset of the PEBP family. The marked conservation of not only the overall protein fold, but the essential features of the putative ligand binding and neighbouring effector sites, strongly implies the biological function of these molecules is likely to be similar in both plants and higher organisms. In plants there is a clear relationship between the presence and activation of CEN family genes and the development of organ-like structures such as buds and ¯owers. Effects at the organism level directly attributable to PEBP proteins in mammals have yet to be described, although the presence of the HCNP peptide, which is liberated from the N terminus of PEBP, is known to effect morphological changes in the hippocampus during development. The recent demonstration that mammalian PEBP interacts directly with Raf-1 and inhibits its kinase activity provides a timely clue as to the action of these proteins. An emerging view is that CEN and PEBP proteins act as regulators of kinase cascade pathways, which control cell proliferation and differentiation. Relatively little is known of the structures of the immediate molecular targets through which CEN and PEBP proteins exert their effects. This comparison of the critical structural features held in common by both the mammalian PEBP proteins and the relatively evolutionary distant plant CEN subfamily has highlighted a common ligand-binding site despite signi®cant re-arrangements of the surrounding surface features of these proteins. Examining the potential PEBP and CEN structures from sequence and structure comparisons suggests this ligand-binding site is consistently adapted for the binding of phosphoryl ligands. PEBP binds to the kinase domain of Raf-1 and inhibits downstream events dependent on phosphorylation. Mutational studies have highlighted residues forming the phosphate-binding site as critical to the inhibitory effect of PEBP on Raf-1 (K. Yeung, personal communication). Similarly, one of the identi®ed molecular ligands for the SP protein found in tomato (a member of the CEN family) is a serinethreonine kinase (E. Lifschitz & L. Pneuli, personal communication). A series of characterised, naturally occurring, point mutant alleles of Arabidopsis TFL1 (homologues of CEN) have been described which are de®cient in promoting shoot growth (Bradley et al., 1997). Two of these mutations (T67I and E83 K) are at sites immediately adjacent to the ligand-binding site. All of these studies highlight a crucial requirement to maintain the conformation of the ligand-binding site for PEBP/CEN function. No direct kinase activity has been reported for PEBP or CEN proteins, nor do their structures

1167 membrane in order to bind its headgroup in the ligand cavity, it is not clear how this region would lead PEBP to localise at the membrane. Additionally, in the structure of bPEBP complexed with phosphorylethanolamine the phosphoryl moiety is buried deep within the binding pocket. From the bound conformation it is dif®cult to see how an intact phosphatidylethanolamine lipid could be accommodated, questioning the notion that the primary role of this site is to localise the protein to the membrane. Dual speci®city has been noted in the PI 3-kinases, which can phosphorylate phosphoinositides in addition to acting as protein kinases (reviewed by Krugmann & Welch, 1998). Additionally, the tumour suppressor PTEN/ MMAC1 has both lipid phosphatase and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities (reviewed by Tamura et al., 1999), providing a precedent for a degree of promiscuity in phosphoryl ligand association. The recent identi®cation from yeast twohybrid screens of protein targets with which hPEBP and SP (CEN) can form complexes provides PEBP/CEN effector molecules perhaps more consistent with the current structural data. Further studies to clarify the molecular interactions of PEBP family proteins are urgently needed. In conclusion, this study of the structure of Antirrhinum CEN ®rmly establishes the CEN proteins as clear relatives of the PEBP family. The unique folding topology seen in these proteins, which is dominated by a large central b-sheet sandwiched between more variable shorter strands and helices, acts as a scaffold for a strongly conserved phosphate-binding site. In combination with two previous structures of mammalian PEBP proteins, the CEN structure is consistent with a model in which CEN controls cell differentiation through interference of regulatory kinase cascades. Although the direct mechanism by which these proteins interact with their substrates awaits the determination of the structure of such a complex, it seems likely that the primary determinant will be the accommodation of a phosphorylated amino acid side-chain in the PEBP/CEN ligand-binding site. Intriguingly, in CEN, as with the PEBPs, this binding site appears to be linked directly through a highly conserved series of amino acid residues to the potential release of the N terminus to form a bioactive peptide. Structural analyses of proteins of uncertain function such as the PEBPs can provide important insights to their molecular activities.

have signi®cant homology with known kinase domains. One interpretation of these accumulated results is that PEBP proteins act as direct antagonists of kinases by binding either directly to their intermediate phosphorylated forms (e.g. monophosphorylated forms) or to their phosphorylated substrates. This implies a level of universality in their activity, perhaps explaining their widespread distribution in tissue types and association with an increasingly wide range of developmental phenomena. Yeung et al. (1999) note there is a twoto 30-fold stoichiometric excess in the amount of PEBP found in a range of ®broblasts relative to Raf-1, certainly suf®cient to act as a general inhibitor to the MEK and possibly other kinase cascades. Unfortunately, at present there are no structures available for the direct targets of PEBP/CEN proteins. There is no obvious correlation between the phosphate-binding site of PEBP/CEN and the mechanism used by the 14-3-3 protein to bind a phosphorylated peptide from Raf-1 (Liu et al, 1995). However, downstream activation by Raf-1 is known to require phosphorylation at more than one site on Raf-1 (Mason et al., 1999) and one possible model is that the PEBP proteins, via their ligand-binding site, form complexes with singly phosphorylated forms of Raf-1 and prevent further phosphorylation. Studies of phosphatase structures (reviewed by Barford et al., 1998) do not reveal obvious structural homologies in the mechanisms evolved by these proteins to handle phosphorylated ligands and that displayed by PEBP proteins. Proteins of the PEBP/CEN family may represent novel topologies for the binding of phosphorylated ligands, providing an ability to act as regulators of kinases in general. Activities previously proposed for the PEBP proteins include phospholipid binding and transport (Perry et al., 1994), and binding of dinucleotides as putative G-proteins (Schoentgen et al, 1992). Although the hPEBP, bPEBP and CEN structures are all consistent with an ability to bind phospholipid headgroups, none has an associated hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the lipid portion of phospholipids, as seen for example in the lipocalins (Flower, 1996). A role as lipid transporters therefore seems unlikely. Secondly, CEN also has no obvious dinucleotide-binding site, further consolidating the conclusions reached from the hPEBP and bPEBP structures that PEBPs are not G-proteins. From both the hPEBP and bPEBP structures it was proposed that the phosphate-binding site and surrounding residues provide a mechanism for binding and localisation of PEBP to the inner leaf of bilipid membranes. Serre et al. (1998) postulated that this activity was enhanced by a ring of basic amino acid side-chains surrounding the entrance to the ligand-binding site. This feature is less pronounced in the CEN structure, where many of these residues have been replaced by non-basic amino acid residues. As a single phospholipid would need to be partially extracted (up to a disÊ tance of 10 A from the membrane surface) from a

In summary, the cell lysate supernatant was loaded onto a chitin-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) (``column buffer'') containing 1 % (v/v) Triton X-100, then washed with the same buffer without Triton X-100. The column was then ¯ushed with buffer containing 50 mM DTT (which induces cleavage of recombinant protein from the chitinbinding domain) and left overnight at room temperature. The following day the recombinant protein was eluted from the column with column buffer. The protein was assessed as >95 % pure by SDS-PAGE. Typical yield was 2-3mg of recombinant protein per litre of culture.

Structure of Antirrhinum CEN

Data were processed with DENZO and scaled with companion program SCALEPACK (Otwinoski & Minor, 1996). All subsequent processing used programs within the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Structure solution and refinement/model building The structure of CEN was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe, as implemented in the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The structure of one monomer of human phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein was used as a search model (PDB: 1BD9). To obtain a correct solution for the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, considerable truncation of the search model was required. The ®nal search model used comprised only hPEBP residues 24-56, 63-91, 100-128 and 162-173, with all non-identical residues between the hPEBP and CEN sequences truncated to an alanine residue. Therefore, the search model contained only 854 atoms out of a total of 5696 (2 Â 2848) in the asymmetric unit for the CEN structure. This represents only 15 % of atoms present, discounting ordered solvent molecules. Despite this, the ®nal solution was clear, having a correlation coef®cient  0.37 and Rcryst  51.8 % (the next best solution had a correlation coef®cient of Ê 0.28 and Rcryst  54.6 %) using data 10-3 A. The structure of CEN was re®ned with REFMAC (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Initial re®nement was performed using all data from 25Ê 1.9 A, with tight NCS (non-crystallographic symmetry) restraints between the two molecules. The ®nal R-factors from the ®rst re®nement round were Rcryst  45.2 %, Rfree  48.3 %. The phases obtained from Refmac were then subject to modi®cation using DM (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). A mask generated from one molecule in the asymmetric unit, in combination with an NCS matrix de®ning the relationship between the two molecules of the asymmetric unit, was used to average the phases (DM was also used in solvent-¯attening and histogram-matching modes, and to further re®ne the NCS matrix). All model building was performed with O (Jones et al., 1991). The initial model was rebuilt using a combination of DM-averaged/non-averaged maps, and SIGMAAweighted maps generated from REFMAC. These initial maps enabled substantial rebuilding of the model which included mutation to the CEN sequence and re-orientation of a number of loop structures. However, no attempt was made to build residues not present in the search model at this stage. Initially only one of the molecules was rebuilt, the second being generated through the NCS relationship prior to re®nement. During all re®nement, tight NCS restraints were maintained for all residues except those that clearly adopted different conformations. Repeated cycles of rebuilding in O and re®nement with REFMAC enabled building of much of the CEN model. An overlay of the hPEBP structure on the partial CEN structure aided chain-tracing in places. Once Rfree È (Brunger, 1992) dropped below 30 %, re®nement cycles were modi®ed to include automated addition of water molecules using ARPP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993). In the last re®nement cycle, Rcryst dropped to a ®nal value of 21.2 % and Rfree to 25.0 %, with an rmsd for bond lengths Ê Ê of 0.013 A and for angles 0.034 A (1.9  ). A summary of re®nement statistics is presented in Table 1. The Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran & Sasisekharen, 1968) for

Crystallisation and data collection Puri®ed CEN was dialysed against 10 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl (pH 7) and concentrated to 13 mg/ml. Initial crystallisation conditions were identi®ed by sparse matrix screening using kits from Molecular Dimensions Ltd.. Diffraction quality crystals were grown from a 1:1 mix of CEN solution and 1.8-2.1 M NaCl buffered over the range pH 5.4-5.6 with 100 mM sodium acetate. For data collection, crystals were quickly washed in 2.2 M NaCl, with 25 % (w/v) glycerol added as a cryoprotectant, and frozen at 100 K in a liquid nitrogen coldstream. A native data set was collected from a single crystal at the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source Ê (SRS), station PX7.2, operating at l  1.488 A. The data were collected on a mar345 image plate detector in two passes. In the ®rst pass, data were collected over the Ê range 40-1.9 A using 111 oscillations of 1  . To ensure complete data for the low-resolution bins, a further 34 images of 2.5  oscillation were collected. In this pass, the detector was placed further away from the crystal, and Ê the data extended over the 40-3.4 A range. Data collection statistics and analysis are presented in Table 1. CEN crystallises in space group P212121, with unit cell dimenÊ Ê Ê sions a  40.89 A, b  77.64 A, c  117.97 A. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit.

the structure of CEN is shown in Figure 6 (generated with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993)); 89.7 % of non-glycine residues are found within the core regions, and the rest in the allowed regions. No non-glycine residue lies in the generous or disallowed regions. The ®nal model comprises residues 9 to 30, 32B to 130 and 143 to 175 for one molecule (A-chain), and 1 to 31, 32B to 130 and 143 to 175 for the second molecule (Bchain) in the asymmetric unit. Note that all numbering is based on an alignment of 38 members of the PEBP family (prepared with CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994), with the hPEBP sequence taken as the reference.
