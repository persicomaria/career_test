The major components of neuritic plaques found in Alzheimer disease (AD) are peptides known as amyloid b-peptides (Ab), which derive from the proteolitic cleavage of the amyloid precursor proteins. In vitro Ab may undergo a conformational transition from a soluble form to aggregated, fibrillary b-sheet structures, which seem to be neurotoxic. Alternatively, it has been suggested that an a-helical form can be involved in a process of membrane poration, which would then trigger cellular death. Conformational studies on these peptides in aqueous solution are complicated by their tendency to aggregate, and only recently NMR structures of Ab-(1­40) and Ab-(1­42) have been determined in aqueous trifluoroethanol or in SDS micelles. All these studies hint to the presence of two helical regions, connected through a flexible kink, but it proved difficult to determine the length

and position of the helical stretches with accuracy and, most of all, to ascertain whether the kink region has a preferred conformation. In the search for a medium which could allow a more accurate structure determination, we performed an exhaustive solvent scan that showed a high propensity of Ab-(1­42) to adopt helical conformations in aqueous solutions of fluorinated alcohols. The 3D NMR structure of Ab-(1­42) shows two helical regions encompassing residues 8­25 and 28­38, connected by a regular type I b-turn. The surprising similarity of this structure, as well as the sequence of the C-terminal moiety, with those of the fusion domain of influenza hemagglutinin suggests a direct mechanism of neurotoxicity. Keywords: Alzheimer disease; amyloid peptides; conformational analysis; fusion domain; NMR.

Alzheimer disease (AD), the well known neurodegenerative disorder associated with neuronal loss, is at present one of the most studied pathologies; nevertheless, it is still one of the least understood at the molecular level. The brains of AD patients are characterized by extracellular proteic plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles [1]. Plaques are built up by fibrils whose major component are peptides known as b-amyloid (Ab), which range in length from 39 to 43 amino acids. All of them have a great propensity towards aggregation in aqueous solution, but the major form found in plaques is Ab-(1­42). The relative abundance of Ab-(1­42) with respect to Ab-(1­40) reflects the fact that even a small elongation of the stretch of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal region increases dramatically the tendency of this peptide to aggregate [2].

Amyloid peptides originate from cleavage of a common precursor called amyloid precursor protein (APP) [3], a glycoprotein of 695­770 amino acids which comprises three parts: the extracellular N-terminal region, a single hydrophobic transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. As the genes encoding APP are on chromosome 21, individuals affected by Down's syndrome overexpress APP and may develop early AD forms [4]. APP can be cleaved proteolitically by different proteases, called a, b and c secretases [5]. The a secretase cleaves APP within the Ab sequence, and its products are not neurotoxic. Alternatively, APP can be hydrolyzed by the b secretase activity at the N-terminus of Ab, which is successively released by the c secretase after cleavage within the membrane [6] either between residues 40 and 41 or between residues 42 and 43. Thus, the N-terminal region of Ab(1­42) derives from the extracellular domain of the precursor, whereas its C-terminal region derives from the membrane-spanning domain [7]. It is generally recognized that the presence of fibrils is necessary for toxicity [8] but it is not generally agreed whether toxicity is generically linked to the occupation of a large area of the cell surface or there is a direct action upon the cell membrane. A possible explanation of the peptide neurotoxicity invokes, as the key event, a membraneporation process. According to this view, which is supported by the results of in vitro electrophysiologic measurements, the a-helical conformation of the peptide would induce formation of membrane channels, allowing the penetration

of substances (such as metal ions) which can cause neuronal death [9,10]. At any rate, both views evidence a critical role for in vivo conformational transitions involving soluble forms of the peptide. As a matter of fact, previous solution studies evidenced that Ab can indeed assume different conformations even in vitro, depending on the experimental conditions. Thus, for example, it has been recently reported that the fibrillogenesis process of Ab-(1­40) and Ab-(1­42) involves an oligomeric a-helical intermediate [11]. Several NMR measurements on both Ab-(1­40) and Ab-(1­42) have been carried out in different solvents mimicking the interface between aqueous and apolar phases, such as SDS micelles [12,13] and in solvents that can reproduce an apolar microenvironment, such as trifluoroethanol/water mixtures [14]. All these studies evidenced the presence of two helical regions, connected by a more flexible and disordered link; however, there is no consensus on the length and position of the helical stretches nor on the structural features of the link region. Another point that should be considered is the complex heterogeneous nature of SDS solutions, which does not necessarily reflect the conformational tendencies in a physiological apolar environment (such as the lipid phase of membranes). Moreover, the very role played by the micellar environment is not generally agreed on: thus, Coles et al. [12] suggested that the a-helical region might correspond to the portion of the peptide crossing the membrane, whereas Shao et al. [13] reported evidence that the peptide is located entirely on the outside of the micelles, in contact with the negatively charged surface. In this paper we report on a CD and 2D NMR conformational study of Ab-(1­42) in several media that can create apolar microenvironments mimicking the lipid phase of membranes. The most detailed structure was obtained using aqueous mixtures of a fluorinated alcohol, hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). HFIP has been chosen as a result of a vast exploratory search because it can dissolve Ab-(1­42) better than all other media and, at the same time, it has a helix-promoting ability very similar to that of trifluoroethanol [15,16].

all steps. After deprotection of the last Na-Fmoc group, the peptide resin was washed with methanol and dried in vacuo to yield the protected Ab-(1­42)-PAC-PEG-PS-Resin. The protected peptide-resin was treated with trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/phenol/ethanedithiol/thioanisole (reagent K) (82.5 : 5 : 5 : 2.5 : 5, v/v/v/v) 10 mL per 1 g of resin at room temperature for 3 h [19]. After filtration of the exhausted resin, the solvent was concentrated in vacuo and the residue triturated with ether. The crude peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography using a Polymer Laboratories PLRP-S polymer-based reversedphase column. The column was maintained at 45 °C and perfused at a flow rate of 1 mLÆmin)1 with a mobile phase containing solvent A (5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8 in 5% acetonitrile), and a linear gradient from 0 to 20% of solvent B (5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8 in 90% acetonitrile) in 25 min was adopted for the elution of the peptide. The fraction containing the pure peptide was lyophilized twice and the purity assessed by a MALDI-TOF analysis using a Hewlett Packard G2025A LD-TOF system mass spectrometer and a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Sample preparation It has been shown that a trifluoroacetic acid pretreatment renders Ab easily soluble in aqueous solutions and in organic solvents; the trifluoroacetic acid treated Ab exhibits the properties of monomeric, random coil structures and lacks preaggregated material [20]. Thus, in order to ensure sample reproducibility and removal of aggregated states which can be present, dry peptide was pretreated with neat trifluoroacetic acid for 3 h, followed by 10-fold dilution with milliQ water and lyophilization. This procedure was adopted for all CD and NMR samples immediately before dissolution in the appropriate solvent. Circular dichroism spectroscopy Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostated cell holder, using a quartz cell of 1.0-mm path length. Spectra were collected over the wavelength range 260­190 nm with a bandwidth of 2.0 nm and a time constant of 8.0 s, and corrected for the contribution of the buffer. In order to prevent peptide aggregation, which tends to occur when water is added directly, a prescored amount of trifluoroacetic acid-treated peptide was dissolved in 120 lL of HFIP and 160 lL of an appropriate HFIP/water mixture were added cautiously, to give a final peptide concentration of approximately 80 lM and a water content between 0 and 50% by volume. Unless otherwise stated, the temperature was 25 °C. For estimation of secondary structure content, CD spectra were analyzed by a linear combination fit using the reference data of Greenfield and Fasman [21]. NMR spectroscopy Samples for NMR spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving approximately 4 mg of trifluoroacetic acid-treated peptide in 200 lL of d2-HFIP, followed by dilution with 300 lL of d2-HFIP/H2O (or d2-HFIP/D2O), 2 : 1 v/v. This results in a final HFIP/water ratio of 80 : 20 v/v,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Solid phase peptide synthesis and purification Ab-(1­42) was synthesized according to published methods using standard solid-phase synthesis techniques [17] with a Milligen 9050 synthesizer. Protected amino acids and chemicals were purchased from Bachem, Novabiochem or Fluka (Switzerland). The resin (4-hydroxymethylphenoxyacetic acid) on the polyethyleneglycol/polystyrene support, loaded with Na-Fmoc-Ala (Fmoc-Ala-PAC-PEG-PS) was from Millipore (Waltham, MA, USA). Fmoc-Ala-PACPEG-PS resin (0.15 mmolÆg)1, 1 g) was treated with piperidine (20%) in dimethylformamide and linked with Na-Fmoc-Ile (eightfold excess), via its pentafluorophenyl active ester. All the other Na-Fmoc amino acids pentafluorophenyl active ester were sequentially coupled to the growing peptide chain and the coupling reaction time was 1 h. To optimize the synthesis, after each acylation step, we adopted a capping protocol with N-(2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyloxy) succinimide as described [18]. Piperidine (20%) in dimethylformamide was used to remove the Fmoc group at

corresponding to a water molar fraction of 0.60. The actual peptide concentration (approximately 2 mM) was checked before and after each measurement by UV absorbance, using an estimated extinction coefficient of 1280 M)1Æcm)1 at 280 nm. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer. One-dimensional spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection and the water signal was suppressed by low-power selective irradiation. Two-dimensional COSY [22], TOCSY [23] and NOESY [24] experiments were collected in the phase-sensitive mode using quadrature detection in x1 by time-proportional phase increase of the initial pulse [25]. Typical data sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run at 300 K with mixing times in the range of 80­200 ms. The data were transformed with NMRPIPE [26] and analyzed with NMRVIEW [27]. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data were multiplied by shifted sine functions (COSY) or lorentz-to-gauss windows (NOESY, TOCSY) in the direct dimension, and by shifted sine or sine square functions in the indirect dimension. The chemical shifts were referenced to the residual HFIP signal at 3.88 p.p.m. The assignment of chemical shifts was obtained by the usual approach described by Wuthrich [28], examining ¨ COSY, TOCSY and NOESY spectra; some ambiguities arising from signal overlaps were resolved by examining spectra acquired at different temperatures (290 and 310 K) or in a d2-HFIP/D2O mixture. The assignment of chemical shifts was brought to 87% completeness (100% complete for the backbone). NOE cross peaks (d2-HFIP/H2O and d2-HFIP/D2O spectra) were integrated with NMRView and were converted into upper distance bounds with the routine CALIBA of the program package DYANA [29]. After discarding redundant and duplicated constraints, the final list included 130 intraresidue and 283 interresidue (149 sequential and 134 medium range) constraints, which were used to generate an ensemble of 100 structures by the standard protocol of simulated annealing in torsion angle space implemented in DYANA (using 6000 steps). No dihedral angle restraints and no hydrogen bond restraints were applied. The best 20 structures, which had low values ° of the target functions (0.83­1.19 A2) and small residual ° violations (maximum violation ¼ 0.38 A), were refined by in vacuo minimization in the AMBER 1991 force field [30], using the program SANDER of the AMBER 6 suite [31]. To mimic the effect of solvent screening, all net charges were reduced to 20% of their real value, and moreover a distancedependent dielectric constant (e ¼ r) was used. The cut-off ° for non­bonded interactions was 12 A. At this stage, the protonation states of the amino acid side chains were chosen to correspond to a low pH value, on account of the fact that the peptide samples had been pretreated with trifluoroacetic acid (see above). The NMR-derived upper bounds were imposed as semiparabolic penalty functions, with force ° constants of 16 kcalÆmol)1ÆA2; the function was shifted to ° linear when the violation exceeded 0.5 A. The best 10 structures after minimization had AMBER energies ranging from )441.4 to )391.1 kcalÆmol)1, and were used to represent the structure of Ab-(1­42). The final structures were analyzed using the program MOLMOL [32].

RESULTS
In the search for conditions which allow structural studies of Ab in a homogeneous, isotropic environment, we have examined the solubility and spectroscopic features of Ab-(1­42) in a variety of media in different concentration and temperature conditions. Several organic solvents and mixtures of organic solvents with water, such as trifluoroethanol, trifluoroethanol/H2O, hexafluoroacetone hydrate, hexafluoroacetone hydrate/H2O, HFIP/H2O, CH3OH, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylsulfoxide/H2O, were tested. The solubility of Ab-(1­42) in methanol is poor; in contrast, trifluoroethanol and mixtures of trifluoroethanol/H2O are able to dissolve the peptide but after few hours a precipitate was observed. Hexafluoroacetone hydrate and hexafluoroacetone hydrate/water mixtures can also dissolve the peptide at millimolar concentrations, and the solutions were stable for weeks; however, NMR signals were broad and the quality of data acquired in these solvents didn't allow an easy interpretation. Dimethylsulfoxide and mixtures of dimethylsulfoxide/H2O (containing up to 5% water) seemed to be suitable solvents for studying the structure in solution by NMR, thus an almost complete backbone assignment was performed. However, the analysis of NOESY spectra evidenced only the presence of sequential, short-range contacts, suggesting the absence of any preferential conformation. In the end, we found that stable, mM solutions of Ab(1­42) can be prepared in HFIP/H2O mixtures. Water content and temperature can be changed within fairly large ranges without peptide precipitation. HFIP was chosen in view of its solvent power and also its ability to stabilize helical structures. In fact, although HFIP is a polar molecule, it can solvate apolar surfaces with its strongly hydrophobic side chains; this feature has been aptly described by Rajan et al. as a Teflon coating that can surround a helix [16] in the case of a mixture of water and hexafluoroacetone hydrate, a mixture with properties very similar to those of aqueous mixtures of HFIP. CD measurements on Ab-(1­42) have shown that in HFIP/H2O mixtures, under optimal conditions, the helical content can be higher than in other solvent mixtures in which conformational studies have been reported, such as aqueous trifluoroethanol or SDS micelles (data not shown). The solvent mixture composition we adopted for NMR was also optimized by CD. Figure 1 shows the molar ellipticity at 220 nm, which can be related to the a-helix content, as a function of water percentage in the mixture. The ellipticity increases with the water concentration, reaching a plateau at approximately 20% water. Correspondingly, the helix content, as estimated by standard linear combination fits of the spectra [21], increases from 54% in neat HFIP to approximately 82% at the plateau. The CD spectrum in the 80 : 20 mixture is essentially unchanged in the temperature range 10­45 °C (data not shown), suggesting a high conformational stability of Ab-(1­42) in this solvent medium, which was then selected to perform a detailed conformational analysis by 2D NMR. Furthermore, the Ab-(1­42) solution in aqueous HFIP was very stable, as there was no evidence of aggregation or precipitation and the NMR spectra did not change over several weeks. The quality of NMR data is shown in Fig. 2, which displays the low field region of a 600-MHz NOESY

whereas sequential and medium range connectivities expected for helical regions, i.e. HN­HN (i, i + 1), Ha­HN (i, i + 3), Ha­Hb (i, i + 3) and Ha­HN (i, i + 4), are present (or hidden by trivial spectral overlaps) along the whole stretch 8­40, the crucial contact between Ser26 Ha and Ala30 HN is absent. Moreover, Ha­HN (i, i + 1) contacts, typical of extended structures, are also rather strong in this region: taken together, these features can point to an enhanced flexibility or possibly a break in the helix. Structure calculation by a standard DYANA protocol yielded a bundle of 20 structures with satisfactory values of the target function; after restrained minimization in the AMBER force field (Table 1), the best structures formed a tightly clustered family, consisting of two helical regions (residues 8­25 and 28­38, respectively), connected by a kink (Fig. 4). The first helix is very well defined, with a backbone ° RMSD of just 0.38 A, while the second helix is interrupted in some structures at the level of the Ile32­Gly33 connection. Closer inspection of the kink region reveals the presence of a type I b-turn centred on residues 25­26, while residue 27 displays values of the backbone / e w dihedrals around ()150°, 40°), i.e. in the Ôadditionally allowedÕ region of the Ramachandran map. Unconstrained minimization of the structures did not produce any major rearrangement in this region, which instead would be expected if the observed dihedrals were imposed by the influence of artifactual NMR restraints. Thus, the type I b-turn centred on residues 25­26

trifluoroethanol/water mixture [14] displays two helices, over residues 15­22 and 30­35, separated by a 6-residues long disordered region. The remaining NMR studies on full length Ab published to date have been carried out in SDS micelles. The structure of Ab-(1­40) reported by Coles et al. [12] consists of a single helix from residue 15­36, with only a slight bend around residues 26­27; by contrast, the structure published by Shao et al. [13] is described in terms of two a-helices, 10­24 and 28­42, separated by a marked loop involving residues 25­27, with no significant difference found between Ab-(1­40) and Ab-(1­42). Thus, even in comparison with these SDS studies, the helical regions in our structure are longer and better defined; moreover, while an a-helix break is present more or less at the same position in all previous cases, we observe a well defined elbow-shaped structural element. We believe that the regularity of our structure in comparison to those described in [12­14] is a direct consequence of an environment, which can simulate in some way the inner membrane, i.e. the lipid phase.

DISCUSSION
Conformational studies in aqueous solution of Ab have been hampered by fast peptide aggregation, and only very recently some NMR investigation on small fragments [33,34], as well as on Ab-(1­40)ox [35], containing methionine sulfoxide at position 35, have been reported. All these studies, although referred to fragments of different length, with different oxidation states of Met35, and at different pH, suggest that in aqueous solution the peptide can be described as a random coil, with only a small population of local nonrandom structures. Overall, these data indicate that bulk water is not suitable for high resolution conformational analysis of Ab. Moreover several structural investigations in different solvents, reviewed in [12], suggest that in vitro the secondary structure of Ab is strongly dependent on experimental conditions. This is a typical feature of small and medium size peptides, but in the case of Ab the conformational flexibility is particularly interesting, as it can be related to its biological activity. The choice of the solvent is crucial not only to overcome the solubility problem, but also to try to simulate in some aspects the physico-chemical

appears to be a genuine feature of the global structure of Ab-(1­42). At first sight, the shape of the molecule resulting from our structure determination is similar to other helical structures of full length Ab, i.e. Ab-(1­40) or Ab-(1­42) [12­14]: however, a more detailed comparison reveals a number of significant differences.

features of the different environments to which the peptide is exposed in vivo. In particular, if the peptide exerts its toxicity by membrane disruption, it is important to check whether Ab-(1­42) can assume a regular ordered conformation in an environment with properties similar to those of the lipid phase of the membrane, which promotes the formation of short-range H-bonds inducing helical structures. The structural characterization of a monomeric, soluble form of Ab-(1­42) in isotropic media is necessary not only to shed some light on the steps involved in the fibrillogenesis, but, most of all, to evaluate the role of Ab-(1­42) in the interaction with the membrane. The structure of Ab-(1­42) found in aqueous hexafluoroisopropanol, a medium that mimics the lipidic environment of membranes, is boomerang-shaped. It is interesting to note that the second helix (residues 28­38) corresponds to the transmembrane region of APP, and has the typical amino acid composition of transmembrane helices, i.e. small (Gly and Ala) and hydrophobic (Ile, Leu, Met and Val) residues [36]. The only charged residue along this sequence is Lys28, i.e. at the N-terminal end of the helix. A contact surface representation of the lowest energy structure colour-coded according to the electrostatic potential (Fig. 5) shows the presence of a wide positive region within the first helical region. Interestingly, if one positions this surface facing the charged phospholipids of a membrane, the relative orientation of the second helix is such that it can insert into the membrane. It is interesting to note that the structure we find for Ab-(1­42) is in very good agreement with a theoretical model proposed for membrane bound Ab-(1­40) [37]; indeed, between Lys16 and Val40 the two structures are almost identical, including the turn involving Gly25, Ser26 and Asn27. Different packing schemes giving rise to membrane channels have been proposed for this structure [37]. The overall shape of Ab-(1­42) is strongly reminiscent of the structure of the fusion domain of influenza hemagglutinin (HA_fd), recently determined in detergent micelles [38] (Fig. 6A and B). Even more significant is the finding that the sequences of the C-terminal part of Ab-(1­42) and that of HA_fd share indeed a high similarity (Fig. 6C) dictated essentially by the presence of similarly spaced glycine residues, which are considered essential for a good insertion into the membrane and are also frequently involved in membrane protein dimerization [39]. The role of these residues is also evidenced by a similar distribution on the surface of the structures. The breaks in the helix-break-helix motif (indicated by boxed residues), although at nearby positions in the two sequences, are not coincident; however, both structures feature a hydrophobic patch in the inner region of the bent, made up by a cluster of 4/5 aliphatic and/ or aromatic side-chains. These findings lend strong support to the hypothesis that the peptide neurotoxicity is due to a membrane-poration process [10,11]. This view is also confirmed by the very recent observation that in vitro Ab-(1­40) can insert into a lipid bilayer just by its C-terminus [40]; moreover, upon insertion a conformational transition generating approximately 60% a-helix has been evidenced. By contrast, it has been proposed that HA_fd inserts both helical stretches into the membrane [38]. Accordingly, it is possible that the mechanism of membrane interaction and destabilization is different in the case of Ab,

Residue side chains are colored according to their hydrophobic character (high ¼ red, low ¼ blue). The sequences of the two peptides, aligned with CLUSTALX [42], are shown in panel (C). Identical residues are reported in green, conserved or semiconserved in yellow.

but it is fair to say that the similarity with the fusion domain of a virus is strongly suggestive of membrane disruption. The recent observation of a strong synergism between Ab and several viruses at the stage of attachment or entry into the cell lends further support to this hypothesis [41].
