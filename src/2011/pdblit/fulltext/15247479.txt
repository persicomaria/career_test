Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) synthesizes the deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis. The R2 protein of normal class I ribonucleotide reductases contains a diiron site that produces a stable tyrosyl free radical, essential for enzymatic activity. Structural and electron paramagnetic resonance studies of R2 from Chlamydia trachomatis reveal a protein lacking a tyrosyl radical site. Instead, the protein yields an iron-coupled radical upon reconstitution. The coordinating structure of the diiron site is similar to that of diiron oxidases/ monoxygenases and supports a role for this radical in the RNR mechanism. The specific ligand pattern in the C. trachomatis R2 metal site characterizes a new group of R2 proteins that so far has been found in eight organisms, three of which are human pathogens. Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular Gramnegative eubacteria that exhibit a highly specialized biphasic developmental cycle (1). Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen, with 90 million estimated yearly cases worldwide. It is also the leading cause of preventable blindness, affecting some 400 million people. Moreover, genital C. trachomatis infection has been identified as a potent cofactor facilitating the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (2). Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) performs the de novo synthesis of all four deoxyribonucleotides from their ribonucleotide precursors using free radical­ based chemistry. Three

classes of RNR, differing in their radicalgenerating cofactor and oxygen requirements, have been identified. All classes likely evolved from a common ancestor and use the same cysteine thiyl radical mechanism for ribonucleotide reduction (3­5). Class I RNR, found in eukaryotes as well as in some prokaryotes and viruses, comprises the two homodimeric R1 and R2 proteins in an 2 2 architecture (6, 7). The very stable radical in the R2 subunit of class I RNR from Escherichia coli was discovered in the early 1970s and resides on Tyr122 (8). Since then, the tyrosyl radical has been characterized in R2s from several species (9). The tyrosyl radical is generated by the reductive cleavage of molecular oxygen at a diiron center in the R2 subunit and is believed to be transferred to the active site in the R1 catalytic subunit via a long-range radical transfer pathway (5). Class I is further divided into classes Ia and Ib on the basis of sequence similarity and allosteric properties (10). The radical bearing tyrosine is conserved among more than 200 sequenced R2s, and mutants with a phenylalanine in this position are enzymatically inactive (8, 11). However, one study has reported that the mouse Y177F mutant R2 displays no tyrosyl radical but has 0.5% of the wild-type activity in the presence of saturating amounts of R1 (12).

The Radical Site in Chlamydial Ribonucleotide Reductase Defines a New R2 Subclass

Chlamydial R2s are intriguing because they display significant overall homology to other R2s, but the residue corresponding to the tyrosyl radical site in other R2s is a phenylalanine (F127) (Fig. 1A). Yet, many lines of evidence show that the enzyme is active: (i) Chlamydiae cannot import deoxyribonucleotides (13, 14). (ii) The genomes of seven chlamydial species have been completely sequenced, and they contain no other RNR besides this class I RNR variant. (iii) The recombinantly expressed protein is active in vitro and the activity is sensitive to hydroxyurea--indicating a radical reaction (15). (iv) The residues critical for function in other R1 proteins, including the active-site cysteines and the residues proposed to be part of the radical transfer chain, are conserved also in the C. trachomatis R1 sequence. Here we report the crystal structure of the R2 protein from C. trachomatis and its characterization by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data reveal an R2 protein with an unusual setup of the diiron site that upon reconstitution produces an iron-coupled radical, and not the tyrosyl radical found in other R2s. The crystallographic data for the R2 protein from C. trachomatis are summarized in Table 1 (16). The protein consists of 346 amino acids and could be traced from amino acid 2 to 318. The remaining C-terminal residues are disordered, as previously observed in the other structurally characterized R2s (4). The protein (Fig. 1B) has the normal R2 helical fold, although the pleated sheet part, present in the E. coli protein, is missing. The structure is likely representative of all chlamydial R2s because they have high sequence conservation (exceeding 80% identity). The diiron site is coordinated in a long four-helix bundle in the core of the protein. Compared to the other structurally determined R2s, C. trachomatis R2 has a single­amino acid insertion in one of the helices that leads to a bulge in one turn of the helix close to the iron site. In addition to the lack of the normally conserved radical harboring tyrosine, the iron coordination sphere displays interesting differences when compared to normal R2s (Fig. 1, C and D). The iron atoms are coordinated by two histidines and four glutamates, in contrast to the standard three glutamates and one aspartate. Although not a large difference chemically, the coordinating aspartate is a conserved feature

among the other R2 proteins and distinguishes the R2s from other diiron-carboxylate proteins, such as methane monooxygenase (MMO), that display four conserved glutamates (17). In C. trachomatis R2, three nonprotein ligands also coordinate the iron ions in the di-ferric site. On the basis of distances and hydrogen-bonding patterns, we assign these as two iron bridging hydroxides and one terminal water ligand. This is similar to the oxidized MMO metal site but contrasts with other di-ferric R2s that display a bridging oxo group and one terminal water ligand to each iron. The second coordination sphere contains two carboxylates that hydrogen-bond to the histidines (D226 and E119). Again, this is a feature of MMO sites because only the D226 carboxylate is conserved among R2s. One feature that the chlamydial R2s share with other R2s is the hydrogen-bonded path of residues shown to function as a radical transfer pathway from R2 to R1 (Fig. 1D). A tyrosine is located two amino acids from F127 in the chlamydial R2s (Fig. 1A). This tyrosine has been suggested to be the radical site (15). The structure, however, shows that F127 is located in the position where the radical harboring tyrosine is normally situated, whereas Y129, proposed to take its place, is located at the surface of the protein--a highly unlikely environment for a stable tyrosyl radical. Indeed, there are no other tyrosine residues in the neighborhood of the diiron site that are likely candidates for the generation and stabilization of a tyrosyl radical.

Protein expressed in the presence of EDTA showed an iron content of 0.75 Fe per polypeptide. Reaction of this protein with a stochiometric ratio of 3 :1 Fe2 / polypeptide under aerobic conditions gave rise to a singlet EPR signal with a g-value of 1.999 and a linewidth of about 18 G (Fig. 2A). The EPR properties of the radical suggest that it is very similar to what in the reconstitution reaction of E. coli R2 is known as intermediate X (18), the penultimate species directly responsible for oxidation of the tyrosine. The signal intensity was maximal at about 1 s after mixing at 0°C and corresponded to 1/3 of the polypeptide concentration. The identity of the EPR-observable species was verified by using 57Fe in the reconstitution reaction (Fig. 2B). The observed 26-G hyperfine splitting by 57Fe is typical of compound X (18, 19). The EPR signal of the iron-coupled free radical decayed with a rate of 0.2 s 1 at 20°C without EPR-visible successors. When the stochiometry ratio of Fe2 /polypeptide was reduced to 1:1, the amount of EPR signal was reduced by a factor of 2, but the rate of decay of the signal decreased to 0.05 s 1. The mechanism of oxygen activation and radical generation in the tyrosyl radical­ containing R2 proteins has been extensively studied, mainly in E. coli R2 but also in R2s from other species. The reaction can be formally written as follows (E. coli numbering):

O2 R2-Y122-OH (Fe2 Fe2 ) e 3 R2-Y122-O (Fe3 -O2 H Fe3 ) H2O. The four-electron reduction of dioxygen is accomplished by two electrons from the iron ions, one from an external reductant such as excess ferrous iron or ascorbate and one from the tyrosine (Y122 E. coli numbering). The reaction proceeds via intermediate X, which decays with a rate constant of about 1 s 1 (E. coli R2) or 5 s 1 (mouse R2) at 5°C concomitant with the appearance of the stable tyrosyl radical (18, 20­22). In intermediate X the oxygen atoms are fully reduced. The external electron has entered the iron site and X is characterized formally as a Fe3 -Fe4 species with an oxo bridge and a coordinated hydroxide (5, 19, 23, 24). The entire diiron site is then formally in the same oxidation state as a di-ferric site coupled to a tyrosyl radical. Thus, it is possible that the primary active radical generated in the chlamydial system is at the diiron site itself in the form of the intermediate X oxidation state, as observed in the EPR experiments. The lifetime of the observed iron-coupled radical is shorter than that of the tyrosyl radical in other R2s. However, a facile continuous regeneration via a reduction/oxygenation reaction at the iron site, as previously observed in the E. coli system (25), may be in effect and sustain a sufficient level of the radical. With this in mind, it is noteworthy that, unlike other R2s, the metal-site setup in C. trachomatis R2 parallels that in MMO and other diironcarboxylate proteins that depend on reduction of the iron site and oxygen activation in each turnover of the enzymatic reaction. Both in vivo (13, 14, 26) and in vitro (15) data show that the C. trachomatis R2 protein functions together with the R1 subunit and performs ribonucleotide reduction with iron and reductant present in the in vitro assay. The chlamydia R2 diiron-site setup thus characterizes a second way of creating a functional R2 protein. Interestingly, chlamydia is not

the only organism containing this type of R2 diiron site. By extensive database searching using both sequence and pattern searches, we have identified R2 sequences from seven other organisms that also lack the otherwise conserved radical harboring tyrosine (Fig. 3). Despite a low overall sequence identity, all the sequences that lack the tyrosine also display the other MMO-like metal-site features, indicating a mechanistic relation between these. Based on the differences in metal-site structure and radical identity, we propose that this group should constitute a new class I RNR subclass: class Ic. The organisms identified thus far that possess this type of R2 protein are very diverse; they include the archaea Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and Sulfolobus solfataricus, and the eubacteria Thermobifida fusca, Tropheryma whipplei, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, and Bacillus thermoleovorans. It should be noted that M. tuberculosis also contains a normal R2 with the tyrosyl radical (27), and B. thermoleovorans, S. solfataricus, and T. fusca are thermophilic organisms. One reason why chlamydiae do not use the normal structural solution that in other organisms is so successful for radical generation and stabilization could be that the class Ic R2 is more efficient in certain environments. The tyrosyl radical in RNR appears to be a key target for the antiproliferative effects of nitric oxide (NO) (28, 29) (supporting online text). NO is produced in the immune response by inducible nitric oxide synthase

(iNOS). In cell lines and inbred mouse strains, resistance to microbial growth is often associated with production of NO, and iNOS inhibitors have been shown to worsen the course of disease caused by many pathogens (30). In contrast, it has been shown that mice genetically deficient in iNOS resolve chlamydial genital infection with kinetics similar to that of wild-type animals (31­33) (supporting online text). One appealing possibility is that the independence of the stable tyrosyl radical in the chlamydial R2 makes this pathogen more resistant to NO. In addition to chlamydiae, three of the class Ic­ containing organisms identified thus far are intracellular pathogens. M. bovis is an animal pathogen, whereas Tr. whipplei and M. tuberculosis are human pathogens. Although still relatively few in number, the organisms identified to contain a class Ic R2 are either intracellular pathogens, archaeaons, and/or thermophiles. It is possible that the class Ic R2s of these organisms contribute to their ability to survive under certain

conditions, one example of which may be the environment created by a host's immune response. A thorough understanding of the underlying principles could help in the design of new antibiotics and treatments for pathogens containing the class Ic R2. Note added in proof: Recently, genome analysis was performed of a chlamydiaerelated symbiont of free-living amoebae (34). This organism is believed to share a common ancestor with pathogenic chlamydiae but contains a normal R2 protein. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the new class Ic R2 developed in response to a more elaborate immune response.

Intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes (IELs) are likely to play a key role in host mucosal immunity and, unlike other T cells, have been proposed to differentiate from local precursors rather than from thymocytes. We show here that IELs expressing the T cell receptor are derived from precursors that express ROR t, an orphan nuclear hormone receptor detected only in immature CD4 CD8 thymocytes, fetal lymphoid tissue­inducer (LTi) cells, and LTi-like cells in cryptopatches within the adult intestinal lamina propria. Using cell fate mapping, we found that all intestinal T cells are progeny of CD4 CD8 thymocytes, indicating that the adult intestine is not a significant site for T cell development. Our results suggest that intestinal ROR t cells are local organizers of mucosal lymphoid tissue. The gut-associated immune system includes mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), Peyer's patches (PPs), and T lymphocytes that reside in the intestinal lamina propria (LPLs) and within the single layer of intestinal epithelial cells (intraepithelial T lymphocytes, IELs) (1, 2). T cells present in mLNs and PPs share the characteristics of mainstream peripheral T cells (bearing the T cell antigen receptor, TCR), whereas IELs, and to a lesser extent LPLs, are enriched in T cells that express the TCR. A large proportion of and IELs express the CD8 homodimeric form of the CD8 coreceptor (1, 2). In the absence of a thymus, these cells nevertheless develop and can be derived from grafts of bone marrow, fetal liver, and intestinal tissue into lym1 Molecular Pathogenesis Program and 2Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.

phopenic mice (3­5). These observations have been used to support the existence of an extrathymic pathway for the generation of IELs. However, because athymic mice have a 50 to 80% decrease in IELs and an even greater reduction in IELs, it has also been argued that IELs are predominantly derived from thymocytes (1, 6, 7). This view is supported by the finding that, in TCR transgenic mice, expression of self-antigen in the thymus results in deletion of conventional T TCR IELs cells, but selection of CD8 bearing the same antigen specificity (8). Small clusters of hematopoietic cells, termed cryptopatches (CPs), are detected between crypts in the small intestinal lamina propria of mice and appear after weaning, numbering up to 1700 in the adult intestine (9). The majority of CP cells express c-kit and IL-7R , but no lineage markers (CD3­B220­CD11b­ CD11c­Gr-1­), and have been reported to give rise to both and IELs when transferred to lymphopenic hosts (5, 10). Hence, it has been suggested that CP cells represent extrathymic progenitors of intestinal T cells (5, 10), although this interpretation has remained somewhat controversial (6).

Thymic Origin of Intestinal T Cells Revealed by Fate Mapping of ROR t Cells

The nuclear retinoic acid­related orphan receptor ROR t is necessary for the development of LNs and PPs (11, 12). During fetal life, ROR t is exclusively expressed in lymphoid tissue­inducer (LTi) cells and is required for their generation (12). In the adult, ROR t regulates the survival of immature double-positive (DP, CD4 CD8 ) thymocytes (11). Using mice that are heterozygous for insertion of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter into the Rorc( t) gene [Rorc( t) /GFP mice] (12, 13), we observed that, in adult animals, ROR t is also expressed in cells within cryptopatches (Fig. 1A). ROR t cells were further detected in isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) (14) and in the subepithelial dome of PPs but were not evident within the intestinal epithelium, in mLNs or in periaortic LNs. Most, if not all, intestinal ROR t cells expressed both c-kit cells were and IL-7R and lin­c-kit IL-7R likewise positive for ROR t (Fig. 1, B and C). In mice rendered deficient for ROR t through breeding the Rorc( t)GFP allele to homozygosity, intestinal lin­c-kit IL-7R cells and CPs were absent, and no intestinal GFP cells could be observed. In these animals, ILFs also failed to develop (Fig. 2), which was apparent from the absence of B cell clusters characteristic of these structures (Fig. 1A) (9, 10). Although intestinal B cells, T cells, and CD11c cells (Fig. 2) were present in normal numbers in the mutant mice, there was substantial and specific reduction in all subsets of intestinal T cells, , including CD4­8­ (DN), CD4 , CD8 cells (Fig. 2B). This decrease and CD8 in intestinal T cells could be accounted for either by reduced thymic output (11) or by impaired differentiation of cells outside of the thymus. In the absence of ROR t, DP thymocytes progress prematurely into the cell cycle and undergo massive apoptosis (11), a phenotype that can be rescued by transgenic expression of Bcl-xL (11). To force expression of Bcl-xL in intestinal ROR t cells, we generated bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-transgenic mice (15) that express BclxL under control of the Rorc( t) gene
