The origin of metal ion selectivity by members of the SmtB/ArsR family of bacterial metal-sensing transcriptional repressors and the mechanism of negative allosteric regulation of DNA binding is poorly understood. Here, we report that two homologous zinc sensors, Staphylococcus aureus CzrA and cyanobacterial SmtB, are "winged" helix homodimeric DNAbinding proteins that bind Zn(II) to a pair of tetrahedral, interhelical binding sites, with two ligands derived from the a5 helix of one subunit, Asp84 Od1 (Asp104 in SmtB), His86 Nd1 (His106), and two derived from the a5 helix of the other, His970 Nd1 (His1170 ) and His1000 N12 (Glu1200 ). Formation of the metal chelate drives a quaternary structural switch mediated by an intersubunit hydrogen-binding network that originates with the non-liganding N12 face of His97 in CzrA (His117 in SmtB) that stabilizes a low-affinity, DNA-binding conformation. The structure of the Zn1 SmtB homodimer shows that both metal-binding sites of the dimer must be occupied for the quaternary structural switch to occur. Thus, a critical zinc-ligating histidine residue obligatorily couples formation of the metal-sensing coordination chelate to changes in the conformation and dynamics of the putative DNA-binding helices.

Introduction
Zinc and other transition metal ions play essential roles in the diverse array of cellular processes, either as structural components in proteins or as obligate cofactors in metalloenzymes.1,2 All metal ions, however, become toxic at high concentrations. This has led to the evolution of homeostatic mechanisms that maintain the intracellular concentrations of biologically required metal ions, e.g. Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Co, and Ni, in a range that is compatible for cell viability through the involvement of specific metallochaperones that traffic

metals inside cells and/or the coordinate regulation of specific uptake and efflux systems.3,4 Heavy metal pollutants, e.g. Cd, Pb, Bi, and Hg, are removed efficiently from cells using the same general mechanisms. Although the specific details differ, gene regulatory systems required for the efficient detoxification and resistance of high concentrations of transition metal ions are ubiquitous in nature. In prokaryotes, the SmtB/ArsR5 and MerR6 family of metal sensor proteins represent two general classes of metalloregulatory proteins. MerR proteins are transcriptional repressors in the absence of inducing metal ions and become potent activators when bound to their metal-ion coactivator;7 metal binding drives an underwinding of the promoter DNA, which repositions the 2 10 and 2 35 sequences to allow for a favorable interaction with RNA polymerase.8 Other non-metal regulated MerR family members include Escherichia coli SoxR,9 which senses oxidative stress via a 2Fe-2S redox center, and Bacillus subtilis BmrR,10

which binds toxic drugs and regulates the expression of a multidrug efflux transporter. Although metal-sensing MerR proteins have been characterized that respond to a wide range of divalent transition metals,6 how individual MerR regulators discriminate among distinct metal ions and couple metal binding to DNA conformational changes is unknown. The SmtB/ArsR family of homodimeric helixturn-helix (HTH) proteins represses the expression of operons associated with metal ion sequestration or efflux in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, allowing these organisms to survive when challenged with toxic concentrations of heavy metal ions.11 Human pathogenic bacteria, including virulent strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis12 sometimes encode many such metal-resistance systems, potentially providing a selective advantage for survival in the human host. Comparative biochemical and spectroscopic studies of six SmtB/ArsR proteins reveal that these proteins harbor one or both of two structurally distinct metal coordination sites, denoted a3N or a5,5,13 named for the location of the metal sites in the known or predicted secondary struc-

ture of individual family members. The a3N site is cysteine thiolate-rich, forming S3 or S4 complexes with large, thiophilic metals including Cd, Pb and Bi, as found in the cadmium sensor S. aureus CadC.13 ­ 15 Site-directed mutagenesis and amino acid sequence comparisons suggested that the a5 site is composed of a combination of carboxylate and imidazole ligands, interacting preferentially with harder transition metal ions including Zn, Co and Ni.12,16,17 Spectroscopic studies of a zinc sensor encoded by S. aureus, CzrA, and a Ni-sensor from M. tuberculosis, NmtR, suggest that a change in the coordination number from four in CzrA to six in NmtR in the a5 metal sites is sufficient to switch the metal selectivity from Zn/Co in CzrA to Ni/ Co in NmtR.17 Metal binding to both sites is known to regulate operator-promoter binding strongly, negatively and allosterically, reducing the affinity of the repressor for DNA by ^ 300-fold, depending on the system.15,17,18 Synechococcus SmtB regulates the expression of the divergently transcribed smt operon nearly exclusively in response to Zn(II).12,19 In addition to the smtB gene, this operon encodes SmtA, a prokaryotic metallothionein that sequesters toxic

metals.20 S. aureus CzrA regulates the expression on the czr operon, the expression of which is induced by Zn and Co.21,22 The czr operon encodes CzrB, a predicted cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) antiporter efflux pump23 that appears to be structurally homologous to E. coli ZitB.24 SmtB and CzrA share 35% identity in overlapping regions, including proposed ligands to the a5 metal ion; however, CzrA lacks an N-terminal extension as well as other amino acid ligands thought to comprise the a3N metal-binding site in SmtB (Cys14, His18, Cys610 ° and Asp640 ) (see Figure 1(a)).16 The 2.2 A structure of apo-SmtB reported previously25 reveals that homodimeric SmtB is a highly elongated winged HTH protein, with each subunit adopting an aaaabba structure. This structure provided little direct insight into the regulatory mechanism, since the structure of the zinc-bound protein was not reported.

Results
A metal-induced quaternary structural conformational change in Synechococcus SmtB A ribbon representation of the structure of apo wild-type SmtB solved to higher resolution than ° previously (1.7 A; see Table 1 for structure statistics) is shown in Figure 1(b). As expected,25 the structure conforms to the winged helix class of homodimeric HTH (a3-turn-aR) DNA-binding proteins.26 As previously found,25 the first 20 or so N-terminal amino acids of both subunits, denoted the N-terminal arm, are missing from the electron density maps, presumably because they are disordered. However, it is clear from this structure that the N-terminal arm of one subunit is close to the a3 helix of the other, suggesting that the previously characterized a3N Zn(II) in SmtB (Figure 1(a))16 site employs ligands drawn from both subunits. Previous biochemical studies showed that apoSmtB contained both a3N and a5 metal-binding sites and that the occupancy and precise coordination environment of each depended on the nature of the metal ion.16 Therefore, a triple-substitution mutant of SmtB was prepared in which all three cysteine residues (Cys14 in the N-terminal arm, Cys61 in the a3 helix, and Cys121 near the C terminus; Figure 1(a)) were converted to nonliganding serine residues, to create a5-SmtB. This mutant, like S-methylated SmtB,16,18 retains the high binding affinity of the a5 metal ion, and strong negative regulation of smtO/P binding in vitro, but blocks metal binding to the a3N site.16 Figure 1(c) shows the global structural differences between apo-SmtB and fully zinc-liganded ° a5-SmtB, determined to 2.3 A resolution, as depicted by a superposition of the a5 helices of one of the two protomers (the subunits on the right) within each dimer. Strikingly, the overall structural change induced by metal binding is

exclusively quaternary structural in nature, well described as a rigid-body rotation/translation of one subunit relative to the other. For example, in this superposition (Figure 1(c)), the Ser74 Ca atom in the aR helix of the subunit shown on the left ° ° moves by 4.8 A, or an average of < 2.4 A in each subunit within the dimer; this reduces the pointto-point distance between Ser74 Ca atoms on ° ° ° opposite subunits by 3.6 A, from 51.7 A to 48.1 A. Thus, the homodimer becomes more globally compact on Zn(II) binding, in qualitative agreement with the results of previous sedimentation equilibrium experiments;27 this results in significant movements of both the HTH motif and b-hairpin wings in opposite subunits relative to one another. The two zinc ions are bound to the homodimer across the dimer interface in a symmetry-related pair of interhelical a5 metal-binding sites that straddle the a5 helices, fully compatible with predictions made from the primary structure (Figure 1(d))16 as well as a preliminary analysis of a heavy-atom derivative of apo-SmtB obtained from mercuric acetate soaks.25 Both zinc chelates in Zn2 a5-SmtB adopt distorted tetrahedral coordination geometries (ligand-Zn-ligand bond angles ranging from 89­ 1248 with 109.58 perfect tetrahedral symmetry; averaged Zn-ligand bond lengths of 2.05 ­ ° 2.14 A), with ligands donated by Asp104 Od1 and the His106 Nd1 atoms of one protomer, and His1170 Nd1 and Glu1200 O11 of the other. The metal chelate is largely pre-organized, with the exception of Glu120, which is in an "open" conformation in the absence of metal (in one protomer, electron density could not be traced beyond L118) and swings in to "close the gate" on the metal complex (Figure 1(d)). Mutagenesis of His106 to a non-liganding Gln abolishes negative regulation of DNA-binding in vitro18 and, when replaced by Arg, abrogates zinc-sensing in vivo,19 revealing that this is in fact the functional zinc-sensing site in SmtB. Crystallographic studies of S. aureus CzrA A ribbon representation of the dimer of dimers of the related zinc sensor apo-CzrA found in the ° crystallographic asymmetric unit, solved to 2.0 A resolution, is shown in Figure 2(a). The first five to eight N-terminal residues and C-terminal three to five residues are not visible in the electron density maps. Chemical shift indexing5 and the magnitude of the heteronuclear 15N ­ 1H NOE (M.A.P. and D.P.G., unpublished results) reveal that these N-terminal and C-terminal regions are disordered in solution as well. In contrast to the extensive interface formed by the N-terminal a1 and C-terminal a5 helices on opposite subunits within the dimer, the interdimer interface is filled with H2O molecules with contacts largely limited to the turn connecting the a3 and a4 helices and the N-terminal end of the a4 helix (primarily residues Asn50, Ser54 and Gln55) in the HTH motif. This is likely a crystal packing interface, since sedimentation equilibrium experiments show no

evidence of self-association beyond the dimer.17 As expected from previous NMR studies, the secondary aaaabba and tertiary structures of apo-CzrA are identical with that of apo-SmtB (Figure 1(b)).5 The major difference between the crystallographic dimeric structures of apo-SmtB and apo-CzrA is that apo-CzrA is more compact than either apo- or Zn2 a5-SmtB. For example, the point-to-point distance between Ser54 Ca atoms in the aR helices on opposite subunits in apo-CzrA (Ser54 is analogous to ° Ser74 in SmtB; see Figure 1(a)) is 43.8 A, nearly ° smaller than in apo-SmtB. 8A A global superposition of the structures of apo ° and Zn2 CzrA, the latter solved to 2.3 A resolution, a shown as a protomer C superposition (Figure 2(b)), reveals that in contrast to SmtB (Figure 1(c)), the global quaternary structural change upon metal binding in CzrA is small, with the intersubunit Ser54 Ca distance decreasing by only ° 0.5 A. This may be due, in part, to crystal packing forces, since both Zn2 versus apo-CzrA crystal

lattices (vide supra) are stabilized by a similar set of interdimer interactions mediated by the a3-turn-a4 HTH motif. In apo-CzrA, these interdimer contacts may significantly alter the relative orientation of one subunit relative to the other in this dissociable homodimer ðKdimer ¼ 1:7£ 105 M21 Þ:17 In the case of Zn2 CzrA, a zinc ion is ° bound between Ser52 (3.7 ­ 3.8 A) and Asn55 ° ) bridging two molecules related by crystallo(3.3 A graphic symmetry (data not shown). In addition, a second metal ion appears to bridge the bona fide a5-metal binding sites, mediating a second interdimer contact via a distorted square pyramidal coordination sphere, the base of which is formed by His86 N12, His96 N12, His9600 N12 (from another dimer), and a water molecule, with the apical position of the pyramid donated by His8600 N12. Since there is no evidence for additional metal ion binding beyond two per dimeric CzrA molecule in solution,17 these additional metal ions bound by the a4 and a5 helices of Zn2 CzrA are likely crystallographic artifacts that play no role in vivo and may

have been facilitated by the high pH of these particular crystals (see Materials and Methods). Despite these additional interdimer contacts, the coordination structure of the a5 chelate in CzrA is virtually superimposable on that of SmtB (Figure 2(c)), with the N12 atom of His100 donating the fourth ligand in CzrA, rather than the carboxylate

oxygen atom of Glu120 in SmtB, as anticipated from the sequence alignment (Figure 1(a)). In Zn2 CzrA, Zn(II)-ligand coordination bond lengths ° range from 1.8­ 2.1 A, typical for tetrahedral Zn coordination to N/O atoms. The coordination geometry is less distorted than in Zn2 a5-SmtB, since ligand-Zn-ligand bond angles cluster more

A metal ­ ligand-mediated cross-subunit hydrogen bonding network links the metal and DNA-binding sites A detailed analysis of the crystallographic structures of apo and Zn2 SmtB suggests that His117 plays a critical role in establishing an intersubunit hydrogen bonding network that may be important for allostery (Figure 3). This network originates with the non-liganding N12 atom of this His, and extends, via just two hydrogen bonds, the full distance to the DNA-binding aR helix via the aR-b1 loop (Figure 3(a)). In Zn2 SmtB, but not in the apoprotein, this His forms a short, linear N12 ­ H12· · ·OvC Arg870 side-chain to main-chain °  hydrogen bond (dN ­ O ¼ 2:67 A versus 3.6 A in the apo-SmtB structure) across the subunit interface of both protomers. The immediately adjacent amide

group of Leu880 then forms a short backbone  N-H· · ·OvC Leu630 hydrogen bond ðdN ­ O ¼ 2:95 AÞ to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Leu830 , an unsatisfied a-helical hydrogen bond acceptor near the C terminus of the DNA-binding aR helix. Furthermore, on at least one side of the homodimer, the side-chain of Arg870 interacts intimately with the metal chelate, with the guanidino group moving into hydrogen-bonding distance from both the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of His117 and the non-liganding O12 atom of Glu120 upon formation of the zinc complex (Figure 3(b)). A comprehensive sequence alignment reveals that only a5 zinc sensors like SmtB and CzrA universally conserve a basic Arg/Lys/His residue in the position corresponding to Arg87 in the aR-b1 loop of SmtB.5 We hypothesize that these reciprocal main-chain and side-chain hydrogen bonding interactions functionally link the a5 and aR helices of opposite protomers and play a significant role in allosteric coupling of the metal and DNA-binding sites in SmtB.

Since the crystallographic structures of apo and Zn2 CzrA are more similar than different (the average N ­ O distance for the analogous His97 N12 ­ H12· · ·OvC His670 interaction in CzrA ° ° decreases by just 0.1 A on zinc binding, from 2.9 A ° to 2.8 A) (Figure 2(b), insight into changes in conformation and dynamics induced upon Zn(II) binding to apo-CzrA in solution was sought. A high-resolution NMR perturbation map, in which changes in backbone 1HN and 15N amide frequencies that occur upon Zn(II) binding to apo-CzrA are color-coded on the ribbon representation of the structure, with the thickness of the worm also scaling with increased perturbation (Figure 4(a)). Large perturbations (Dppm ^ 0.35 ppm) are generally localized to the immediate vicinity of the bound metal ion in the N and C termini of both a5 helices, with a notable exception being the amide group of Leu68 in the aR-b1 loop, analogous to Leu88 in SmtB (vide supra). Formation of a hydrogen bonding network in CzrA structurally analogous to that determined for SmtB (Figure 3) makes the prediction that in solution, the His97 H12 proton of CzrA would exchange slowly with solvent and therefore should be visible in an 1H ­ 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum. This is indeed the case under our standard NMR solution conditions (40 8C, pH 6.0) (Figure 4(b) and (c)), but only in the Zn2 conformation (1H12 d ¼ 12.4 ppm; 15N12 d ¼ 168.4 ppm) (Figure 4(d)). The same is true of the corresponding His117 H12 proton in Zn2 a5-SmtB (1H12 d ¼ 12.2 ppm; 15N12 d ¼ 167.9 ppm) (Figure 4(d)). In addition, if the amide group of Leu68 in the aR-b1 loop in CzrA donates a hydrogen bond propagating this hydrogen-bonding network in solution, the main-chain amide hydrogen­ deuterium (H ­ 2H) exchange rates of both Leu68 and Leu63 would be expected to be among the slowest in the CzrA, but again, only in the Zn2 form. Although the exchange rate of Leu63 in the Zn2 conformation could not be obtained due to spectral overlap, the kex for Leu68 NH is reduced by 30-fold (0.77 h21 to 0.024 h21) on zinc binding. Strikingly, the H ­ 2H exchange rates of Leu68 in the aR-b1 loop, and nearly all of the buried hydrogenbonding amide protons in the core of a-helices a1, a2, aR and a5, as well as those at the base of the b-hairpin wing, uniformly decrease substantially ( ^ 20-fold) in the Zn2 versus apo forms of the homodimer (Figure 5). A striking exception to this

is the b-hairpin wings, whose exchange rates remain rapid in both conformations. These same trends in internal dynamics in solution mirror the crystallographic temperature factors for both forms of CzrA, with mobilities within the core of Zn2 CzrA strongly dampened, again with the exception of the b-wings, which become even more highly mobile on Zn(II) binding (data not shown). Note that in the structure of Zn2 a5-SmtB (Figure 1(c)), the polypeptide chain of one of the b-hairpin wings within the homodimer could not be traced, indicative of considerable disorder in the crystal in this region. Both a5 Zn(II) sites in SmtB must be filled to drive the quaternary structural switch The crystallographic structure of Zn1 wild-type ° SmtB, solved to 2.0 A resolution, where just one of the a5 zinc binding sites was occupied by a metal ion, was obtained (Figure 6(a)). The empty site on the homodimer is easily distinguished from the filled site in this structure due to the distinct conformations of the Glu120 "gating" residue (Figure 6(b)). Strikingly, the quaternary structure of Zn1 SmtB is essentially superimposable on that of apoSmtB, with the aforementioned hydrogen-bonding network clearly not established on either side of the homodimer. Consistent with this, the intersubunit distance between the aR Ser74 Ca atoms is ° ° 51.3 A, very close to the 51.7 A found for apoSmtB. Interestingly, the metal chelate appears only partially formed, with very long coordination ° ° bonds to both His106 (2.55 A) and His1170 (2.57 A) in this complex (Figure 6(b)), relative to Zn2 SmtB ° ° (dZn-H106d1 ¼ 2.08 A; dZn-H117 Nd1 ¼ 2.05 A). These results suggest that both a5 metal-binding sites must be loaded in order to drive a concerted quaternary structural conformational transition. This finding makes the prediction that zinc binding to the a5 metal sites of the CzrA or SmtB homodimer might be negatively cooperative (stepwise metal association equilibrium constants, Ki ; where K1 . K2 ), since some of the free energy of binding to the second site ðDG2 Þ must be used to drive the quaternary structural change in conformation and/or dynamics. This is what is found for apoCzrA (Figure 6(c)). A quantitative analysis of metal-binding affinities using two fluorescentchelator competition assays16,28 reveals that Zn(II) binding to apo-CzrA is extremely tight at equilibrium (25 8C, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.0), and strongly

Allosteric Switch in Zinc Sensors SmtB and CzrA

pathway(s) of allosteric coupling in these homologous SmtB/ArsR sensors.

Discussion
The X-ray crystallographic and NMR studies reported here provide new molecular level insight into the mechanism of negative allosteric regulation of operator/promoter binding by evolutionarily related zinc-sensing metalloregulatory transcriptional repressors. Utilization of both Nd1 and N12 faces of a critical liganding histidine residue (His97 in CzrA; His117 in SmtB) drives a quaternary structural switch in the global conformation and/or internal dynamics of the repressor thereby stabilizing a low DNA binding affinity conformation. In the case of SmtB, Zn(II) induces a quaternary structural compaction of the homodimer that spatially alters the positions of the putative DNA recognition (aR) helices relative to one another (Figure 1(c)). In the case of CzrA, Zn(II) binding simply functions to globally "freeze out" the internal dynamics of the dimer (Figure 5), such that the high-affinity operator/promoterbinding conformation is not energetically accessible to the repressor. In contrast, both apoproteins maintain a substantial degree of global quaternary structural flexibility that may help maximize the affinity of the repressor for various specific DNA binding sites. Utilization of both sides of a key imidazole metal ligand ensures that formation of the a5 metalsensing coordination chelate is coupled directly to formation of the hydrogen bonding network that links the allosteric inducer site to the DNA-binding ° aR helices some 15 A away. Characterization of CzrA substitution mutants in which His97 is replaced with either a non-liganding but hydrogen bonding glutamine residue (H97Q CzrA) versus a potentially metal liganding but poorly hydrogen bond donating thiolate group (H97C) will provide a critical test of the proposed allosteric model. Consistent with our expectations, H97Q CzrA maintains high-affinity, wild-type operator/ promoter binding activity in vitro, but is completely unresponsive to metal ions (M.A.P. and D.P.G., unpublished results). Efforts are underway to determine how this coupling network has been modified to require six metal coordination bonds in the specific Ni-sensing site in M. tuberculosis NmtR,12 rather than four as in CzrA/SmtB, since the same set of four a5 metal ligands are proposed to be common to both CzrA and NmtR metal chelates.12,17 In addition, Cd and Pb binding to S. aureus CadC results in negative regulation of DNA binding via the a3N site in that sensor,13 despite maintaining a high-affinity a5 Zn site. This requires either a key interruption in the flow of communication from the a5 metal-sensing sites to the DNA-binding helices beyond the first shell of the metal ligands, and/or evolution of another

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification and crystallization Wild-type Synechococcus PCC7942 SmtB28 and S. aureus CzrA17 were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified to homogeneity as described. The expression plasmid encoding the triple substitution mutant a5 SmtB (C14S/C61S/C121S SmtB) was prepared using PCR-based mutagenesis of the C14S/C61S overexpression plasmid as template and C121S mutagenic primers.16 The integrity of the nucleotide sequence of both strands of the plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. a5 SmtB was purified to homogeneity using a method essentially identical with that used for wildtype SmtB. All preparations of SmtB, a5 SmtB and CzrA were devoid of bound zinc ((# 0.05 mol equiv metal, as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy) and thus were designated apoproteins; Zn2 complexes were obtained upon the addition of 1.1 monomer-equivalents of ZnSO4 to apoproteins. Initial crystallization conditions were obtained using the hanging-drop method employing Crystal Screens from Hampton Research and Wizard Screens from Emerald Biostructures. Crystallization conditions were as follows: apo-SmtB, 1.6 M Na/K phosphate, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.0); Zn2 a5 SmtB, 1.6 M Na/K phosphate, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.5); apo-CzrA, 2.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M Na/ K phosphate (pH 6.2); Zn2-CzrA, 10% PEG 8000, 0.1 M Ches (pH 9.5), 0.2 M NaCl. Crystals of Zn1 SmtB were obtained from stoichiometric mixtures of Zn(II) and apo-wild-type SmtB obtained under the same conditions of apo-SmtB. Cell parameters, symmetry and monomers per asymmetric unit (ASU) of all crystals are listed in Table 1. All crystals were soaked in paraffin oil for a few seconds before flash-cooling to 100 K and subjected to X-ray diffraction. Data collection, structure determination and refinement Diffraction data were collected at beamline 14-BM-C and D (MAD) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory on a charge-coupleddevice area detector (ADSC Q4). Apo-CzrA data were collected with a rotating anode and a Rigaku IPDS IVþ þ system. Data collection parameter and statistics are listed in Table 1. Reflection data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK.29 Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using the search models based on the previously published structure of apo-SmtB.25 Molecular replacement solutions were found using CNS30 or programs from the CCP4 suite.31 Multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD)32 using the Zn-edge of the derivative was used to solve the phase problem for Zn2 a5-SmtB (see Table 1). The program SOLVE33 was used to locate the metal ion sites in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was carried out against the peak data set. Initial phases of all forms were improved by solvent flattening as implemented in DM,34 RESOLVE35 and CNS.30 The molecular coordinates were constructed using the computer program O36 and refined with CNS30 or REFMAC.37 Shake and wARP38 was used to minimize model bias.

NMR spectroscopy All NMR spectra were acquired on Varian Unity Inova 500-MHz and 600-MHz spectrometers in the Biomolecular NMR Laboratory at Texas A and M University. Typical solution conditions were 0.6­ 2 mM 15N-labeled or 15N/13C-labeled protein, pH 6.0, 10 mM d18-Hepes, 100 mM NaCl and 10% (v/v) 2H2O, 40 8C. Samples in .99.9% (v/v) 2H2O were obtained by buffer exchange over a G-25 column (Sigma). Chemical shift referencing is relative to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS).39 All spectra were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe40 and Sparky 3. 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectra41 were recorded as 128 £ 512 two-dimensional matrices in the t1 and t2 dimensions, respectively. The three-dimensional 15N-separated nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum42 ðtm ¼ 100 msÞ was recorded as a 12 £ 256 £ 741 three-dimensional matrix with acquisition times of 49.4 ms (t1 ; 15N), 21.3 ms (t2 ; 1 H), and 61.8 ms (t3 ; 1HN), at a decoupler offset positioned at 168 ppm. The 2D 1H ­ 15N heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC)43 spectrum of Zn2 CzrA was acquired in 2H2O with the 15N spectral width set to 70 ppm, centered at 195 ppm. The 2D [13C,1H]transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)H(CDCG)CB experiment44 was acquired in 1H2O at 40 8C with a 13C spectral width of 32.5 ppm centered on Cb resonances. Complete resonance assignments of apo and Zn2 CzrA will be reported elsewhere. Samples for hydrogen ­ deuterium (H ­ 2H) exchange were prepared by exchanging protein samples into 2 H2O in 10 mM d18 Hepes (pH 6.0), 100 mM NaCl using a G-25 spin column equilibrated in the final NMR buffer in 2H2O.45 The sample was placed immediately into the NMR spectrometer and 15N ­ 1H HSQC spectra acquired continuously every 20 ­ 30 minutes over 11 hours immediately following exchange and then at various exchange times ðtex Þ for five to six weeks thereafter (apo-CzrA, tex ¼ 456 hours and 575 hours; Zn2 CzrA, tex ¼ 35; 45, 100, 113 and 912 hours). Cross-peak intensities of the 15N ­ 1H HSQC spectra for each non-overlapping peak of apo and Zn(II) CzrA were measured by volume integration using Sparky 3. Peak intensities were then fit to a single-exponential function: A ¼ A0 ½eð2ktÞ  þ C where C is baseline noise of a particular sample.46,47 Protein Data Bank accession codes The atomic coordinates for apo-SmtB, Zn2 a5-SmtB, apo-CzrA, Zn2 CzrA and Zn1 SmtB have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (http://www.rcsb.org/) under accession codes 1R1T, 1R22, 1R1U, 1R1V and 1R23, respectively.
