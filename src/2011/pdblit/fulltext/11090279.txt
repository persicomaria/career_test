Abstract Acetylation of specific lysines of core histone Nterminal tails correlates with chromatin assembly and specific regulation of gene expression. Core histones acetylated at particular lysines mediate effects on chromatin function ; however, the manner in which different histone acetyltransferases (HATs) discriminate lysines is unknown. Here we propose a putative rule for lysine selection by HATs based on the primary sequence in the vicinity of lysines in the core histone N-terminal tails and in flanking sequence. This provides insight into the molecular basis of site selection of core histones by HATs. z 1998 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Since the early discovery of histone acetylation [1], histone acetyltransferases (HATs), enzymes responsible for this modi¢cation, have been considered modi¢ers of chromatin structure and key players of gene expression [2]. Recent identi¢cation of various types of HATs [3^12] represents a signi¢cant breakthrough in understanding the functional role of acetylation. Fifteen lysines (in human cells) which reside in four core histones are acetylated in various patterns in vivo [13,14]. Site speci¢city of di¡erent HATs is also divergent [6,8,11,15,16]. Taking into consideration that acetylation of particular lysines in core histones mediates speci¢c e¡ects on chromatin function [17], it is important to elucidate the molecular basis involved in selection of speci¢c lysines by HATs. The relationship between the divergent pattern of lysine acetylation of core histones and site speci¢city of HATs has remained obscure. Our analysis of the primary sequence in the vicinity of lysines of the core histone N-terminal tails showed that lysines acetylated in vivo can be classi¢ed into six groups and this classi¢cation ¢ts well with site speci¢city of known HATs and patterns of acetylation in vivo. 2. Lysines acetylated in vivo can be classi¢ed into six groups Two criteria were introduced to classify the 15 lysines acetylated in vivo in all four core histones into six groups. First, these 15 lysines were grouped into three classes on the basis of chemical properties of amino acid residues located N-terminal

to the lysines (class I^III). Each was further classi¢ed into two groups according to similarities in £anking sequences (group A^F). When we compared this classi¢cation with the site speci¢city of HATs (Table 1), we found that lysines of a given group are acetylated by the same HATs. yHat1p acetylates only lysines of group A but not groups B^F, and yGcn5p acetylates only lysines of group B but not lysines of other groups. Site speci¢city of dTAF230 and SRC-1, which have been analyzed only for histone H3, also ¢ts well with our classi¢cation. p300/CBP, general co-activators that interact with various types of DNA binding regulatory factors, acetylate lysines of more than two groups implying that p300/CBP are HATs with a lesser site speci¢city. Since the site speci¢city of HATs analyzed to date correlates well with our classi¢cation, we propose that distinct HATs have the potential to distinguish among groups A^F. Examination of all 28 lysines residing in the core histone Nterminal tails revealed that while lysines acetylated in vivo can be classi¢ed into groups A^F, lysines that are not acetylated in vivo cannot be classi¢ed into these groups, based on our criteria, except for LysW of human histone H2A (H2A-9), which is classi¢ed into group B (Table 2). H2A-9 was found to be acetylated in calf thymus [18], hence, HATs may also recognize this residue, under certain conditions. The ¢nding that lysines not acetylated in vivo cannot be classi¢ed into groups A^F supports our proposal that classi¢cation can be applied to all HATs active in vivo. 3. Discussion Since our classi¢cation ¢ts well with site speci¢city of known HATs and also with patterns of acetylation in vivo, residues critical for our classi¢cation may also be important for other unknown HATs to distinguish among lysines of the four core histones. Therefore, we predict the existence of novel HATs responsible for acetylation of speci¢c lysines which belong to groups C, D, E and/or F. Mechanisms involved in site speci¢city of HATs in complex [15,19] will require further study. However, taking into consideration that yeast Hat1p and Hat2p complex acetylates H412 (sequence KGLGK), but not H2A-5 and H4-5 (SGRGK) [15], the groups may be further classi¢ed into subgroups according to di¡erences in properties of the other residues in the £anking region of these acetylated lysines. However, there are other proteins which have been reported to be the targets of HATs that contain sequences which do not fall into the proposed groups [20,21]. Thus, there remains the possibility of other ways of substrate recognition by HATs. Although recognition of substrate by enzyme is determined

The amino acid sequences of human histones are shown [13,14]. The site speci¢city of HATs are analyzed for free histones or amino-terminal tail peptides.  Abbreviations: +, acetylated; 3, not acetylated; ?, not determined.  Amino acid residues N-terminal to the acetylated lysines are parenthesized.  Acetylated lysines are underlined, residues similar within each group are in bold. Table 2 Classi¢cation of lysines residing in the core histone N-terminal tails

The amino acid sequences of human histones are shown [13,14]. Lysines examined are underlined and their positions are parenthesized, residues similar within each group/class are in bold.  This lysine can be classi¢ed into group B (discussed in the text).

by the tertiary structure of involved protein, our classi¢cation of lysines as based on £anking sequence provides insight into the manner in which HATs select particular lysines of core histones, which may possibly be applied to substrate selection by histone deacetylases (HDACs).
