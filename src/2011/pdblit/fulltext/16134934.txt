Structure of the Leu300Pro mutant of human aldose reductase (ALR2) in complex with the inhibitor fidarestat is determined. Comparison with the hALR2-fidarestat complex and the porcine aldehyde reductase (ALR1)-fidarestat complex indicates that the hydrogen bond between the Leu300 amino group of the wild-type and the exocyclic amide group of the inhibitor is the key determinant for the specificity of fidarestat for ALR2 over ALR1. Thermodynamic data also suggest an enthalpic contribution as the predominant difference in the binding energy between the aldose reductase mutant and the wild-type. An additional selectivity-determining feature is the difference in the interaction between the inhibitor and the side chain of Trp219, ordered in the present structure but disordered (corresponding Trp220) in the ALR1-fidarestat complex. Thus, the hydrogen bond (7 kJ/mol) corresponds to a 23-fold difference in inhibitor potency while the differences in the interactions between Trp219(ALR2) and fidarestat and between Trp220(ALR1) and fidarestat can account for an additional 10-fold difference in potency.
Introduction Aldose reductase (ALR2, EC 1.1.1.21) is a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones.1,2 ALR2 is the first enzyme in the polyol pathway and converts glucose to sorbitol, which is subsequently transformed to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. During a hyperglycemic event, the elevated glucose flux through the polyol pathway enhances ALR2 activity and has been shown to play a key role in diabetic long-term onset complications such as neuropathy and nephropathy.3 The consequent accumulation of sorbitol in the eye is believed to be responsible for the development of glaucoma, retinopathies, and cataracts in diabetic patients.4 Inhibition of ALR2 thus offers patients suffering from diabetes mellitus a viable therapeutic measure against the debilitating pathologies associated with chronic hyperglycemia.5-7 While many aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) have been reported in the literature, adverse side

effects and lack of efficacy have curtailed the prospect of many drug candidates for clinical use. Epalrestat is the only ARI that is currently marketed for treatment of diabetic neuropathy in Japan, with several other potential candidates in current clinical trials.7-9 It is widely believed that the unfavorable profile of many ARIs in clinical trials is due to their concurrent inhibition of the closely related aldehyde reductase (ALR1, EC 1.1.1.2),10 which is responsible for the reduction of many aldehydes and metabolizes methyl glyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone, which are intermediates in the formation of toxic advanced glycation end products.1,11 ALR1 has a 65% sequence identity with ALR2 and belongs to the same aldo-keto reductase superfamily.1 This overall sequence identity is of secondary importance, the most important are the identities and differences at the active site. Both enzymes are composed of similar R/ TIM barrels,12 with the nicotinamide moiety of NADPH located in an active site position that allows a hydride transfer from the C-4 atom to the carbonyl group of the substrate while a proton is provided by the conserved Tyr48 residue of ALR2 (Tyr50 in ALR1).13 Because of these structural and functional similarities, it is therefore not surprising that many ARIs inhibit ALR1 as well. The loss of ALR1 activity will ostensibly invoke significant functional ramifications. It is therefore necessary to identify any structural differences between these enzymes that may

be exploited in the design of inhibitors that are highly selective for ALR2 over ALR1. The selectivity of an inhibitor for ALR2 is typically expressed by the activity ratio of ALR2 compared to ALR1 inhibition at a given concentration.1 Traditionally, ARIs emerged from two major classes, depending on whether they contain an acetic acid moiety14 or a cyclic imide group. The latter in turn comprises hydantoin/imidazoline-2,4-dione derivatives,15 such as fidarestat and sorbinil, or succinimide derivatives,16 like minalrestat and AS-3201. These polar groups are usually attached to a hydrophobic ring system.6 X-ray structures of several ALR2-inhibitor complexes showed that the polar hydantoin and carboxylate groups bind in a conserved anion-binding site adjacent to the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme. They form hydrogen bonds with ALR2 residues Tyr48, His110 and Trp111.12,15 Inhibitors containing either the cyclic imide or carboxylic acid anchor exhibit similar in vitro but lower in vivo activity with respect to the carboxylic acid derivatives. This observation has been attributed to the relatively lower pKa values and accordingly their ionization at physiological pH.17-19 Most ALR2 inhibitors are also effective against ALR1 because they bind to the enzyme in a very similar manner with the polar inhibitor moiety wedged between the nicotinamide ring and the conserved residues Tyr48, His110, and Trp79.12,20,21 The hydrophobic ring systems of the inhibitors are bound tightly in a pocket that is adjacent to the anion-binding site. Inhibition and biochemical studies have suggested that inhibitors with different potencies for ALR1 and ALR2 are likely to interact with residues residing in the C-terminal loop,20,22 since this portion is not conserved across members of the aldoketo reductase superfamily.1 Moreover, crystallographic and modeling studies of ALR1 and ALR2 in complex with inhibitors have shown that inhibitors specific to ALR2 interact with C-terminal residues by binding to the same subsite, which has been described as the "specificity" pocket.12,15,23 In the present study, a crystal structure was determined for the complex of a Leu300 to Pro300 (Leu300Pro) mutant of the human ALR2 holoenzyme with the bound inhibitor (2S,4S)-6-fluoro-2,5-dioxospiro[chroman-4,4imidazoline]-2-carboxamide (fidarestat). Recently, the structure of human ALR2 in complex with fidarestat has been determined (PDB code 1PWM). It has been suggested that cyclic imides cross the biological membrane as neutral species before releasing a proton and subsequently binding to the active site as an anion.24 The hydantoin ring of fidarestat is located in the conserved anion-binding site between the nicotinamide ring of the NADPH and the active site residues Tyr48, His110, and Trp111. Its chroman ring is located within van der Waals contact distance of the side chains comprising the "specificity" pocket residues Trp20, Trp111, Phe122, and Trp219, while its exocyclic amide (carbamoyl) group forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain nitrogen of Leu300. This interaction was proposed to be the major factor for the high fidarestat affinity and selectivity advantage toward ALR2 over ALR1.15 In an attempt to confirm this assumption, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the specific goal of converting Leu300 into a Pro residue, which represents

the ALR1 equivalent of Pro301. Determination of the crystal structure of the corresponding mutant ternary complex will allow the direct comparison of the interaction pattern with that of the previously determined ALR2 ternary complex.24,25 A calorimetric study will also be undertaken to investigate any changes in binding energies as a consequence of this mutation. Results and Discussion The Leu300Pro mutant of aldose reductase was cloned, expressed, and purified as described in Materials and Methods. Cocrystals with fidarestat were prepared, and the structure was solved using molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 1.0 Å. The mutated proline and the inhibitor appeared clearly in the electron density map (Figure 1). Aldose reductase folds into an eight-stranded R/ barrel, with the active site located at the C-terminal end of the barrel. A total of 316 residues, NADP+, fidarestat, and 588 solvent molecules constitute the final model. Multiple conformations were observed for 98 residues. In a Ramachandran plot, 90.3% of the residues (excluding Gly) are in the most favorable region and 9.7% (excluding Gly) are in the allowed region. High-Resolution Features of the Leu300Pro ALR2-Fidarestat Complex Structure. The structure shows all the characteristic details of a highresolution structure. In ordered regions (B < 7 Å2) several hydrogen atoms are observed, attached to main chain atoms and even some of those attached to side chain atoms. These observations allow experimental determination of protonation states of some residues and the unique assignment of H-bonds. The overall stereochemical quality of the final model was inspected using PROCHECK.26 The average of the  angle shows an rms deviation from the peptide bond planarity of 6.0°. This value matches a mean typically found by PROCHECK for normal proteins. Nevertheless, some significant deviations from this mean are observed. An example is the Ser76-Lys77 peptide bond ( angle of -166.7°, a deviation of 13.3° from the standard value) where the deviation from planarity is stabilized by an H-bond between the nitrogen atom of Lys77 and the side chain oxygen atom of Ser76. The same geometry was observed in several other complexes ALR2-inhibitor, like the one with IDD594.27 Lys77 is

supposed to be involved in the enzymatic mechanism because Lys77-NZ polarizes the catalytically important hydroxyl group of Tyr48. A characteristic of the high-resolution structure is the clear visibility of solvent at the protein surface, which represents an excellent source of information for the study of protein hydration. In the Leu300Pro ALR2fidarestat structure, several tetrahedral arrangements and pentameric clusters of water molecules are observed. An example is shown in Figure 2, where the water network near the mutated proline is shown. One network of tetrahedrally coordinated waters is linked to O (Ala299) and N (Leu301). This network shares an edge with a pentameric polygon facing a hydrophobic region of the protein (the double conformation of Leu301). These observations are similar to those previously reported for the ALR2-IDD594 complex.27 Inhibitor Binding Site. The active site represents a well-ordered region as apparent from the electronic density map (Figure 1) and in agreement with low B factor values (6 Å2). The inhibitor fidarestat binds to this site, adopting an orientation very close to that observed for the complex with ALR2 wild-type.24 The inhibitor's hydantoin moiety is placed deeply into the active site, interacting with the residues Tyr48, His110, Trp111, and the cofactor NADP+. The N atom of this moiety is placed at 2.76 Å from the N 2 atom of His110, while one O atom is at 2.60 Å from the Tyr48 hydroxyl and the other O atom is at 2.83 Å from the N 1 atom of Trp111, making H-bonds in all cases (Figure 3). These H-bonds anchor the hydantoin moiety firmly in the anion binding site. Furthermore, the difference map shows a well-resolved density peak along a straight line between the N1 (inhibitor) and N 2His110, virtually equidistant from both N atoms (Figure 3). This peak attributed to an H atom clearly indicates a hydrogen bond. It also shows at least partial protonation of N1His110. The position close to this atom but opposite the binding site, normally fully occupied by a water molecule, is partially occupied by a water molecule and

partially by a chloride ion, as indicated by anomalous scattering. This fact confirms the mechanism proposed by El-Kabbani et al.24 that the binding of fidarestat involves a proton transfer from the inhibitor to His110. The fact that hydantoins are effective in vivo suggests that they pass the membrane barriers in their neutral form, and therefore, their binding is likely to be accompanied by that of a negative ion, as suggested by the crystal structure. The hydrogen connected to N3 of the inhibitor points toward the aromatic plane of Trp20, suggesting an interaction with its  electrons (Figure 3). At the level of Pro300, the mutation Leu-Pro causes a local shift of residues 299-302 (Figure 4), probably due to the need to accommodate the geometry of the proline main chain. The H-bond of the O atom of the fidarestat amide with the N atom of Leu300 in the wildtype (2.96 Å) is lost. There is a contact of 3.48 Å between the O atom of the fidarestat's exocyclic amide and the main chain N atom of Ala299, but the geometry is not adequate for a proper H-bond. The B factors of the N

and O atoms of the fidarestat's exocyclic amide group are larger than those of the remaining part of the inhibitor (14 vs 9 Å2), suggesting that upon loss of the H-bond to Leu300 this portion gains higher residual mobility. In comparison, the B factors for these atoms in the fidarestat-ALR2 complex are of the same order as for the remaining portion of the inhibitor. The N atom of the amide group forms H-bonds to neighboring water molecules, while the O atom points to the protein but does not form any H-bonds. Comparison with the ALR1-Fidarestat Complex. The superposition of the structure of the Leu300Pro hALR2-fidarestat complex with the porcine ALR1fidarestat complex28 in the active site region (Figure 5) gives rise to the following observations. The orientation of the inhibitor is very similar in both cases and the interactions of the hydantoin head with residues His110, Tyr48, and Trp111 follow the same patterns. The position of Pro300 in ALR2 superimposes with that of Pro301 in ALR1. In both cases the exocyclic amide moiety of the inhibitor does not form any H-bonds with the protein. Instead, close van der Waals contacts are observed. However, they are experienced through different contacting atoms in ALR1 and ALR2 because the flanking side chains of Pro300 (Pro301 in ALR1) and Trp219 (Trp220 in ALR1) reside on the protein backbones that take a slightly different trace in space because of structural and sequential differences. In the case of ALR1,28 as indicated by the electron density map, the side chain of Trp220 occupies two conformations of which the minor one (20% occupancy) has an orientation similar to that observed in the ALR2 structure. The

exocyclic amide moiety makes van der Waals contacts with the side chain of Trp220 in both conformations (2.99 Å for the minor and 3.59 Å for the major one). Because this side chain is already disordered in the aldehyde reductase holoenzyme,13 this suggests that the short contact with the minor conformation might favor the major one. Microcalorimetry. Comparison with Sorbinil. To trace the selectivity-determining features in terms of the thermodynamic data, we studied the binding of the related inhibitors fidarestat and sorbinil by microcalorimetry, toward wild-type aldose reductase and its Leu300Pro mutant. The only difference between these inhibitors is the exocyclic amide present in fidarestat.12,15,24 The binding of the two inhibitors is affected by superimposed changes in protonation states that, in principle, have to be corrected before a subsequent factorization into absolute enthalpic and entropic contributions can be performed. However, assuming that for each individual ligand such protonation effects are identical for wild-type and mutant, a relative comparison of the thermodynamic differences and thus driving forces can be attempted for each ligand with respect to the wild-type and Leu300Pro mutant. As shown in Table 1, the Gibbs free energy of binding G° of fidarestat to wild-type is approximately 8 kJ/ mol lower than that of fidarestat to Leu300Pro mutant. Fidarestat forms a hydrogen bond via its carbonyl oxygen of the exocyclic amide functional group and the Leu300 backbone NH. In the Leu300Pro ALR2-fidarestat complex a similar hydrogen bond cannot be formed because of the absence of an NH functionality in proline. Obviously this loss of a hydrogen bond relates to a G° difference of 8 kJ/mol. In the case of the structurally related sorbinil, virtually identical G° values are observed for the same pair. Because sorbinil lacks an appropriate functional group to hydrogen-bond to the main chain atoms of Leu300,12 the loss of such functionality on the side of the protein due to the Leu300Pro replacement is not experienced by ligand binding. Interestingly enough, the free energy drop of fidarestat is mainly attributed to an enthalpy loss whereas entropy remains nearly unchanged. For sorbinil the unchanged G° for both complexes factorizes into mutually compensating enthalpy and entropy changes leading to an enthalpically more favorable and entropically less beneficial binding to the wild-type. This thermodynamic difference possibly results from the presence of an interstitial water molecule mediating H-bonds between sorbinil and the main chain N atom of Leu300, similar to the one observed in the complex structure of sorbinil with pig lens aldose reductase (Figure 6). This water-

responsible for the reduced free energy of binding accounting for the selectivity advantage. Conclusions The complex structure of the ALR2 mutant with fidarestat clearly shows that the H-bond of the exocyclic amide group of the inhibitor with Leu300 is lost without being compensated by a similar interaction. The thermodynamic data support this hypothesis because the predominant difference between mutant and wild-type is of an enthalpic nature. Facing the mutant data with the structure of the ALR1-fidarestat complex suggests that the H-bond toward Leu300 is a key determinant for the specificity of fidarestat for ALR2 over ALR1. Furthermore, the mutant complex indicates an additional selectivity-determining feature attributed to the split conformation of Trp220 observed in the ALR1 complex. Elucidation of such features on a molecular level and factorizing their contributions into enthalpic and entropic portions to binding are essential to provide the necessary guidelines for a rational lead optimization. With such information at hand, the medicinal chemist knows by which molecular properties his lead structures have to be equipped to achieve the desired selectivity advantage for a particular member of a protein family. High selectivity, e.g., avoiding unwanted cross-reactivity at other targets, is one major prerequisite for the development of safe drugs for the future. Materials and Methods
Wild-Type ALR2 Expression and Purification. The open reading frame of the human aldose reductase gene (accession GenBank/EMBL data bank number J05017) was amplified by PCR from cDNA.29 Cloned into the T7 RNA polymerase-based vector pET15b (Novagen), the protein was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) induced by IPTG (Euromedex). After 3 h of incubation at 310 K, the pellet from a 4 L culture was disrupted by sonication and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a Talon metalaffinity column (Clontech). After thrombin cleavage of the hexahistidine extension, the protein was finally loaded onto a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a NaCl gradient. Leu300Pro ALR2 Expression and Purification. The mutation of the leucine 300 into proline was introduced by PCR, using the Pfu enzyme as polymerase to amplify the entire plasmid. After 25 cycles of PCR, the initial plasmid was digested by DpnI enzyme. After amplification (in DH5R E. coli strain), purification (with Nucleospin kit), and sequencing to confirm the mutation, the mutated plasmid was integrated in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for production. The mutated protein was then expressed and purified by the same procedures as that used to obtain the wild-type protein. Crystallization. Crystals of the Leu300Pro ALR2 holoenzyme-fidarestat ternary complex were grown in a Linbro 24-well culture plate (Flow Laboratories) using the vapor diffusion method.30 Protein was cocrystallized with NADP+ (Sigma) and inhibitor (in a 1:2:2 ratio of protein/coenzyme/ inhibitor) in an equal volume of 50 mM ammonium citrate buffer (pH 5, containing 15% PEG 6000), previously equilibrated with 100-times diluted stock seed solutions. The 10 µL hanging drops were incubated at room temperature over a well solution of 20% PEG 6000 in 120 mM ammonium citrate. Crystals were transferred into a stabilization solution (25% PEG 6000) and then into a cryoprotecting solution (40% PEG 6000) and finally flash-frozen in either liquid nitrogen or ethane. Data Collection and Processing. One crystal (with the dimensions of 0.6 mm × 0.4 mm × 0.3 mm) was used in the diffraction experiments. Almost complete synchrotron data sets

mediated contact cannot exist in the mutant Leu300Pro. The sorbinil binding process to the wild-type captures, besides the ligand itself, a water molecule. The latter fact is assumed to be entropically unfavorable (in the present case a value for -TS of approximately 6 kJ/ mol is observed). For the mutant no interstitial water is arrested; accordingly, no entropic penalty has to be paid. On the other hand, sorbinil forms via its endocyclic ether function an H-bond to the interstitial water molecule in the wild-type, whereas a similar polar contact is missing in the mutant. In consequence, the inventory of polar contacts in solution versus protein remains uncompensated for the latter, which correlates, as indicated by experiment, with a less favorable enthalpic contribution (H  5 kJ/mol). Origin for Selectivity-Determining Features for Fidarestat Binding toward Aldose and Aldehyde Reductase. As shown in Table 1, the selectivity advantage (expressed as a ratio of the binding constants) of fidarestat to the Leu300Pro mutant over the wildtype is approximately 23-fold, arising from a G° of 7.8 kJ/mol. This corresponds essentially to the enthalpy loss of one H-bond. However, considering the IC50 values for the binding of fidarestat to human ALR2 (9 nM) and porcine ALR1 (2500 nM), a larger difference (278-fold) in favor of ALR2 is indicated.28 Even when IC50 values are only indicative of binding constants, this suggests that the binding of fidarestat toward both enzymes is discriminated by additional features, such as the difference attributed to the observed disorder of Trp220 in the ALR1 complex.28 In the ALR2 mutant case, this residue is well ordered and makes a favorable contact (3.40 Å) with fidarestat. In the ALR1-fidarestat complex, this residue adopts at least two conformations, one with a shorter contact to fidarestat (2.99 Å) and one with a longer one (3.59 Å). Therefore, the favorable contact present in the ALR2-mutant case is lost, and a short contact appears, possibly leading to an enthalpic loss in the binding energy. Furthermore, Trp220 is already disordered in the aldehyde reductase holoenzyme,13 which implies that there is no entropic gain associated with this residue when fidarestat is bound. Therefore, it is likely that this interaction of fidarestat with Trp 220 in ALR1, together with the loss of one H-bond, is

Petrova et al. in the ligand solution to the same concentration to avoid heat release caused by the dilution of the cofactor. Solutions were degassed at 293 K under vacuum for 10 min. At the commencement of the experiment, the protein solution in the sample cell was stirred at 400 rpm until a stable baseline had been achieved before the titration was initiated. The injection sequence started with an initial injection of 1.5 µL (for preventing diffusion effects arising from the experimental setup, not used in data fitting) followed by injections of 10 µL at intervals of 300 s until complete saturation was obtained. The heat caused by each inhibitor injection was obtained by integrating the calorimetric signal. Data were analyzed using the ORIGIN software (MicroCal Inc.) for fitting the data points to a single-site binding model that is in agreement with the results from X-ray crystallography. Experimental heats of the protein-inhibitor titration were corrected for the heats of dilution by subtracting the corresponding data from a blank titration (inhibitor injected into buffer) or by subtracting the average of the last three data points obtained from the protein-inhibitor titration after saturation of the protein binding sites had been achieved. Both corrections resulted in approximately the same results. All measurements have been carried out at least in duplicate. With energy values, binding constants, and standard deviations derived from data fitting and subsequent average formation of the corresponding measurements, Gibbs free energy values and -TS° were calculated using

The reference cell contained 0.1 mM sodium azide dissolved in demineralized water. All measurements were carried out at 298 K. The protein was dissolved in 10 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8) to concentrations of 18.9 and 37.8 µM for ALR2 wild-type enzyme and Leu300Pro mutant, respectively. The protein concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy (280 nm). The ligand solution contained 252 µM of the corresponding inhibitor, dissolved in the same buffer, with sonication to facilitate dissolution if necessary. The protein solution was saturated with an excess of NADP+, which was also present
