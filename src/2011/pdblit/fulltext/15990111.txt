Abstract Human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) lacks the ability to phosphoribosylate xanthine, a property exhibited by HGPRTs from many parasitic protozoa. Using random mutagenesis we have obtained a mutant, F36L, of human HGPRT that phosphoribosylates xanthine. Examination of the structure indicates that F36 does not make direct contact with the purine, but long-range modulation via loop IV, a segment contacting purine at C2 position, could influence substrate specificity. Expanded substrate specificity to include xanthine probably arises from increased flexibility of loop IV as a consequence of mutation at F36. Mutation of the corresponding residue, L44 in Plasmodium falciparum HGPRT, also results in alteration of Km and kcat for xanthine, substantiating its role in affecting purine base affinity. Our studies show that mutation of this residue in the core of the protein also affects the stability of both enzymes. Ó 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferases (HGPRT)2 catalyze the Mg2þ dependent conversion of 6-oxopurine bases to their respective mononucleotides. The purine base specificity of this enzyme varies with the species it is derived from. The mammalian, yeast [1], Trypanosoma cruzi [2], Leishmania donovani [3], and Schistosoma mansoni [4] HGPRTs recognize hypoxanthine and guanine while the enzymes from the parasites Tritrichomonas foetus [5], Toxoplasma gondii [6], and Plasmodium falciparum [7] can recognize xanthine in addition. The enzyme from Giardia lamblia can phosphoribosylate guanine alone [8]. Escherichia coli has two enzymes, a HPRT and a GXPRT [9]. The structures of a number of these enzymes have also been determined but the purine binding pockets have been found to be largely

identical [9­18]. The basis for the substrate specificity differences between these enzymes with high sequence and structural similarity remains ambiguous. Mutagenesis studies to address the substrate specificity of HGPRTs remain largely inconclusive with analogous mutations in different enzymes leading to dramatically different effects on function. Though residues involved in purine recognition lie at the C-terminus of the protein, substitution of the first 50 amino acids of human HGPRT with the corresponding residues of P. falciparum HGPRT (PfHGPRT) results in an enzyme with additional specificity for xanthine [19]. A chimeric HGPRT with loop IV residues (204­208) of T. gondii HGPRT substituted with the corresponding residues from the human enzyme, exhibiting loss of activity on xanthine finds mention in the literature [20]. In the T. foetus enzyme, Asp163 makes contacts with the exocyclic amino group of guanine. This residue, equivalent to D194 of the human enzyme, is conserved among HGPRTs. Mutation of this residue to Asn resulted in an enzyme which no longer recognizes xanthine as a substrate. In the same study, mutation of R155 to E resulted in an increase in the Km for xanthine alone. Mutation of

the same residue to Lys resulted in elevated kcat for xanthine though the Km was not altered [21]. The purine base specificity seems to be a consequence of more than one factor, with contributions from different segments of the structure apart from the active site. Understanding substrate specificity becomes important from the point of view of inhibitor design as it leads to the identification of parasite enzyme specific features. We have addressed the problem of substrate specificity by randomly mutagenizing human HGPRT followed by selection for mutants with xanthine activity. Random mutagenesis offers the advantage of large unbiased library sizes allowing selection for alteration in properties by mutation of residues far away from the active site. The role of residues distal from the active site in modulating the substrate specificity of enzymes has been widely documented [22]. Human HGPRT presents itself as an ideal target for directed evolution as mutations that manifest as Lesch­Nyhan syndrome [23] or gouty arthritis due to lack of or reduced activity are not restricted to the active site and are spread over the entire protein [24]. The E. coli strain S/609 (ara, Dpro-gpt-lac, thi, hpt, pup, purH,J, strA) [25] is a convenient screen for xanthine active variants of the enzyme. This strain of E. coli lacks both the de novo and salvage pathways for purine nucleotide synthesis, and its growth can be made conditional to the expression of a HGPRT active on the purine base provided in the medium [26,27]. Screening of a randomly mutagenized library of human HGPRT yielded a mutant, F36L, with the ability to catalyze xanthine phosphoribosylation without compromising the activity on hypoxanthine and guanine. The residue F36 does not lie in the active site pocket of the enzyme, highlighting the role of long-range interactions in modulating the substrate specificity in HGPRTs. The corresponding mutation, L44F, in P. falciparum HGPRT also exhibits alteration in xanthine affinity. The altered specificity is interpreted in context of the available structures and theoretical simulations reported in the literature.

Random mutagenesis and screening To generate the randomly mutagenized library of human HGPRT, 10 ng of the template (human HGPRT gene PCR amplified from a clone in the vector pTrc99A) and 150 ng of the primers 50 HPRT: 50 CCA CCA TGG CGA CCC GCA GCC CTG GC 30 and 30 HPRT: 50 ACA GGA TCC TTA GGC TTT GTA TTT TGC TTT T 30 were used for a 50 ll reaction. The error rates of Taq DNA polymerase were increased by increasing the concentration of dGTP, or dCTP to 2 mM with all other nucleotides at 0.2 mM in independent reactions and by use of 0.3­0.5 mM MnCl2 in the amplification reaction [28]. The mutagenized PCR amplified products were ligated into the expression vector pTrc99A and the ligation mix was transformed into E. coli S/609 by electroporation. Xanthine positive human mutants were obtained by selecting for transformants with the ability to grow on minimal medium plates (1Â M9 salts, 1 mM MgSO4 , 0.1 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM thiamine hydrochloride, 1 mM proline, 0.2% glucose, 0.3 mM IPTG, 25 lg/ml streptomycin, 100 lg/ml ampicillin, and 1.5% agar) supplemented with 0.5 mM xanthine. Functional complementation studies were carried out with S/609 cells transformed with the HGPRT constructs in the vector pTrc99A as described previously [27]. Site-directed mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the megaprimer method [29]. The mutagenic primers used were: F36G: 50 CC ATG AGG AAT TCC CAC CCT TTC C 30 ; F36K: 50 CC ATG AGG AAT CTT CAC CCT TTC C 30 ; F36E: 50 CC ATG AGG AAT CTC CAC CCT TTC C 30 ; F36W: 50 CC ATG AGG AAT CCA CAC CCT TTC C 30 , and F36A: 50 CC ATG AGG AAT GGC CAC CCT TTC C 30 for generation of human F36 mutants. The L44F P. falciparum HGPRT mutant (referred to as L44F) was constructed using the primer Pflf: 50 ACC AAG GTC TTT GTT CCA AAT GGA GTC ATA AAA AAC 30 and the end primers pETpf3: 50 CCA GGA TCC TTA TAA TGA AGT TGC TTT AT 30 and 50 FPRT: 50 CCA CC ATG GCA ATA CCA AAT AAT CC 30 . A P2A mutation was introduced in addition to facilitate cloning. The mutated codons are underlined. The vector, pTrc99A, was used in all cases. The P2A mutant of PfHGPRT (PfHGPRT) has been used for all comparisons with L44F. The P2A mutant has been earlier shown to be similar to wildtype P. falciparum HGPRT [30]. The authenticity of the mutants was verified by sequencing. Protein expression and purification As human HGPRT and its mutants do not hyperexpress in the vector pTrc99A, they were subcloned into

Materials and methods Restriction enzymes, Taq DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and other molecular biology reagents were purchased from Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India, or from MBI Fermentas, Lithuania, and used according to the manufacturers' instructions.

All chemicals used in the assays were from Sigma Chemical Company, USA, and media components were from HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India. Purine base stocks were made in 0.4 N NaOH and all other solutions in water.

the expression vector pET23d and protein was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Expressed proteins were purified as previously reported for the human wildtype enzyme [19]. PfHGPRT was expressed in E. coli S/609 and purified as reported previously [30]. The L44F mutant was cloned into the vector pET23d and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Soluble L44F from lysates after ammonium sulfate fractionation was purified by chromatography on a Cibacron Blue column followed by anion exchange chromatography, both eluted with increasing gradients of KCl in the presence of 20% glycerol in all steps. All enzymes were finally buffer exchanged by gel filtration into potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, and 2 mM DTT and were at least 90% pure as judged by SDS­PAGE (Fig. 1). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford's method with bovine serum albumin as a standard [31]. Enzyme assays and kinetics Reactions carried out at room temperature (22­ 28 °C) were monitored spectrophotometrically [32] using either a Shimadzu UV 1601 or a Hitachi U2010 spectrophotometer. Both PfHGPRT and L44F PfHGPRT have negligible activity on purification and were activated as described previously by incubation with PRPP and hypoxanthine prior to the assays [33,34]. Product formation was monitored spectrophotometrically as an increase in absorption at 245, 257.5, and 255 nm for the formation of IMP, GMP, and XMP, respectively. De values used were 1900, 5600, and 3794 MÀ1 cmÀ1 for the formation of IMP, GMP, and XMP, respectively. Kinetic parameters were determined as reported previously [19,30,33]. Data were analyzed by non-linear regression fit to the Michaelis­Menten equation using the Graph-

Pad Prism package. The standard assay condition was 100 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4, 12 mM MgCl2 , 100 lM hypoxanthine or guanine or 200 lM xanthine, and 1 mM PRPP and appropriate quantity of the enzyme (0.1­ 0.2 lg of human HGPRTs and 1­2 lg of P. falciparum HGPRTs in hypoxanthine and guanine reactions and, 1­2 lg of all proteins for xanthine reactions) in a reaction volume of 250 ll. For determination of temperature stability, proteins at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml were incubated at various temperatures. Aliquots were withdrawn at different times and activity on hypoxanthine measured at room temperature using the standard assay. Determination of in vivo stability For determination of in vivo stability of PfHGPRT and L44F, S/609 cells containing the expression constructs of these proteins in pTrc99A were grown to OD600 of 0.6 at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG to a concentration of 1 mM. Protein translation was arrested by addition of chloramphenicol to a concentration of 300 lg/ml after 4 h of induction. The residual amounts of the expressed proteins, in aliquots withdrawn at different time intervals, were determined by Western blots probed with antibodies to P. falciparum HGPRT.

Results and discussion Screening of the mutagenized library by functional complementation in E. coli S/609 for xanthine active human HGPRT mutants yielded two identical xanthine active clones (Fig. 2A and B). Sequencing of these two clones showed the presence of three mutations, two of which resulted in the amino acid substitutions, F36L and D98G. The two single mutants, F36L and D98G, were generated using convenient restriction sites within the human HGPRT gene. Functional complementation studies on these mutants showed that only the F36L mutant had the ability to support growth of S/609 in minimal medium supplemented with xanthine. Examination of the structure of human HGPRT complexed to a transition state analog [11] shows that residue F36 does not lie close to the active site of the enzyme. This residue in fact lies in the hydrophobic core of the protein (Fig. 3A). Site-directed mutagenesis was therefore carried out to introduce (1) a cavity (F36G and F36A), (2) a positive charge (F36K), (3) a negative charge (F36E), and (4) a bulky residue (F36W) at this position of human HGPRT. Residue F36 of human HGPRT corresponds to L44 in the PfHGPRT sequence. The effect of mutation of L44 to F on the activity of PfHGPRT was also examined. The substrate specificity of all the mutants as determined by functional complementation in E. coli S/609 is summarized in Fig. 2C.

The substrate specificities of F36K, F36E, F36W, and F36A remained unaltered compared to human wildtype. The F36G mutant failed to complement in the presence of any of the three bases while the L44F mutant of PfHGPRT complemented only in the presence of hypoxanthine. Characterization of HGPRTs Studies with purified enzymes were carried out only with the F36L, F36G, and F36K mutants of human HGPRT and with the L44F mutant of PfHGPRT. The kinetic parameters of these mutants are compared to the parent wildtypes in Table 1. The substrate specificities of

the purified wildtype human HGPRT and F36L mutant agree with that obtained from functional complementation studies (Table 1). The wildtype enzyme catalyzes the phosphoribosylation of hypoxanthine and guanine, while F36L shows activity on xanthine also. The kcat and Km s for the purines, hypoxanthine, and guanine remain relatively unaltered. The kcat value for xanthine is much higher than the barely measurable activity of the human wildtype enzyme. The Km for xanthine is also measurable and comparable to that of PfHGPRT. Purified F36G and F36K also have significant activities on hypoxanthine and guanine with the Km s being low, even though F36G is inactive on complementation. The activity of these two mutants on xanthine was also higher

compared to the wildtype. The kcat and Km of PfHGPRT and L44F for the purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine are comparable. The activity of L44F on xanthine is, however, lowered with a twofold decrease in kcat and a fourfold increase in the Km for this base. The Km for PRPP of the two mutants F36K and F36G for the hypoxanthine reaction is also lower compared to that of the wildtype. The PRPP Km for xanthine phosphoribosylation by F36L is also very low and approaches the Kd determined for the wildtype enzyme. The rate-determining step in catalysis by HGPRT is the release of the product and this results in a higher Km for PRPP compared to its dissociation constant [35]. The low PRPP Km observed with F36L indicates that the rate-determining step may be the catalytic step itself for the xanthine phosphoribosylation reaction rather than the release of XMP. A similar reduction in PRPP Km s has been shown in the case of the D137N mutant of human HGPRT where a change in the rate-determining step has been demonstrated by burst phase kinetics [36].

Stability S/609 is an unambiguous system for screening of gain of activity mutations. However, loss of function on complementation can arise due to various factors including expression levels and protein stability leading to differences with activity measurements on purified enzymes. Heat denaturation studies on purified wildtype human HGPRT and its mutants do show a difference in their stability. The wildtype and F36L mutant are remarkably stable retaining more than 80% of their activity even after 3 h at 60 °C. Activity was retained for about 0.5 h at 70 °C. The remarkable temperature stability of human HGPRT has been previously documented [37]. Though F36K and F36G are quite stable retaining a substantial amount of activity at 60 °C, their stability is reduced compared to the wildtype and F36L mutant. This is more pronounced in the case of the F36G mutant (Fig. 4A). This reduced stability may result in the lack of expression and hence, activity of the F36G mutant in vivo preventing complementation.

TheL44F mutant of PfHGPRT was also found to have reduced stability with almost all expressed protein degraded in vivo within 1 h after translational arrest (Fig. 4B). The expression levels of L44F in S/609 are also much lower. Since IMP, the product formed from hypoxanthine, is in the primary pathway of AMP and GMP formation, there is greater cellular ease in the formation of these purine nucleoside monophosphates. However, conversion of GMP to AMP involves the enzyme GMP reductase whose expression is up-regulated with increase in concentration of GMP [38]. The Km of GMP reductase for GMP is also high [39]. As a consequence, complementation would be observed in the presence of hypoxanthine and not in the presence of guanine and xanthine when enzyme levels are limiting, as is the case with the L44F mutant of PfHGPRT. Such discrepancies due to reduced expression between functional complementation and activity measurements have been observed in the case of a mutant of PfHGPRT, Y96C. This mutant complements HGPRT deficiency in S/609 only in the presence of hypoxanthine but the purified enzyme shows activity on all three purine bases [30]. Structural basis for modulation of activity Examination of the structure of human HGPRT shows that F36 does not lie in the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 3A). However, it lies at the base of loop IV (five loops undergo reorganization during catalysis by HGPRTs) making contact with residues on either end of this loop (Fig. 3B). Loop IV dynamics have been proposed to be important for purine recognition [20]. The superposition of the structures of the GMP [16] and immucillin GP (transition state analog), pyrophosphate complexes [11] of the human enzyme shows that large regions of the protein are different between the two complexes. The contacts made by F36 within the subunit, including those with residues in loop IV, differ between the two complexes. Residues Lys186, Val205, Cys206, and Val207 in loop IV make more extensive

contacts in the GMP complex than in the immucillin complex of human HGPRT. The crystal structures of various complexes of HGPRTs from different organisms have been solved [9­ 18]. These structures provide a plausible explanation for the altered substrate specificity of the mutations described here. Heroux et al. [12,20] have determined the structure of T. gondii HGPRT in complex with the nucleotides IMP, GMP, and XMP. Comparison of these structures with that of the human enzyme complexed with GMP allows rationalization of the purine binding specificities of these enzymes. A hydrogen bonding interaction is present between the C2 amino group of GMP and the backbone oxygen of Asp194 (Asp200 in T. gondii) in both these enzymes (Fig. 3B). This interaction would be unfavorable if the C2 substituent were an oxo group as in xanthine. In the XMP complex of the T. gondii enzyme, a readjustment of loop IV together with a rotation of the purine ring allows hydrogen bonding of the C2 carbonyl with the backbone amide of Asp206 [20]. Molecular dynamics simulations of the human and T. foetus HGPRTs in complex with various nucleotides by Pitera et al. [40] show that the C2 pocket of this enzyme is far less rigid compared to the human enzyme which permits it to recognize both the C2 amino group of GMP and the oxo group of XMP. Mutation of F36 probably results in an enzyme in which this loop can rearrange to accommodate the C2 oxo group of xanthine offsetting the repulsive interactions that would otherwise exist in the enzyme. This may also be the case with the F36G and F36K mutants, which have a much greater xanthine activity than the parent wildtype enzyme. Excessive perturbation of interactions within the protein due to mutation of the bulky phenylalanine residue to a glycine may result in the destabilization and reduced activity of the F36G mutant. F36 in the human enzyme corresponds to L44 of PfHGPRT. Kinetic analysis on L44F mutant of PfHGPRT again indicates that perturbation of this region results in alteration in xanthine affinity with the mutant exhibiting a higher Km and lower kcat . These

observations are in agreement with the proposed role of F36 in human HGPRT in modulating substrate specificity, probably by reorganization of loop IV residues. The subunit structure of HGPRTs consists of two sub-domains, the hood and the core, with the active site comprising of loops from both these. The mutation, F36L, in the hood domain of the protein is the first instance of a point mutation in this domain of HGPRTs modulating substrate specificity. This mutant provides direct evidence for the proposed role of hood domain reorganization in accommodating purine bases in the active site of HGPRTs.
