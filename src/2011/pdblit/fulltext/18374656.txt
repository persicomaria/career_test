Catalysis and inhibitor binding by the GH43 -xylosidase are governed by the protonation states of catalytic base (D14, pKa 5.0) and catalytic acid (E186, pKa 7.2) which reside in subsite -1 of the twosubsite active site. Cationic aminoalcohols are shown to bind exclusively to subsite -1 of the catalytically-inactive, dianionic enzyme (D14-E186-). Enzyme (E) and aminoalcohols (A) form E­A with the affinity progression: triethanolamine N diethanolamine N ethanolamine. E186A mutation raises the Ktriethanolamine 1000-fold. By occupying subsite - 1 with aminoalcohols, affinity of monosaccharide i inhibitors (I) for subsite +1 is demonstrated. The single access route for ligands into the active site dictates ordered formation of E­A followed by E­A­I. E­A­I forms with the affinity progression: ethanolamine N diethanolamine N triethanolamine. The latter affinity progression is seen in formation of E­A­substrate complexes with substrate 4-nitrophenyl--D-xylopyranoside (4NPX). Inhibition patterns of aminoalcohols versus 4NPX appear competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive depending on the strength of E­A­4NPX. E­A­substrate complexes form weakly with substrate 4-nitrophenyl--L-arabinofuranoside (4NPA), and inhibition patterns appear competitive. Biphasic inhibition by triethanolamine reveals minor (b 0.03%) contamination of E186A preparations (including a His-Tagged form) by wild-type-like enzyme, likely originating from translational misreading. Aminoalcohols are useful in probing glycoside hydrolases; they cause artifacts when used unwarily as buffer components. Published by Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction Apart from the iminosugars, which are widely known for inhibiting certain glycoside hydrolases in therapeutic and crop disease control applications [1], simpler, achiral aminoalcohols such as tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) and ethanolamine (Scheme 1), which are frequently used as biological buffers at alkaline pH, have long been known as inhibitors of glycoside hydrolases [2­6]. Over the past five decades, Tris and other aminoalcohols have been characterized to inhibit catalysis by glycoside hydrolases competitively [2­5,7­ 9], noncompetitively [10,11], uncompetitively [12], and both competitively and noncompetitively [6] with respect to their substrates. Aminoalcohols have been used to selectively inhibit aminoalcoholsensitive glycoside hydrolases when assaying catalytic activity of aminoalcohol-insensitive glycoside hydrolases from crude biological

extracts [13­15], to inhibit glycoside hydrolase activity in vivo as well as in vitro [16], to serve as the recognition elements of affinity resins for purifying glycoside hydrolases [17,18], and to protect glycosides from hydrolysis upon extraction from biological material [19]. Early studies, without the benefit of three-dimensional structural information of active-site residues, implicated both the cationic [3­5] and free base [2,6] forms of Tris as the inhibitory species on the basis of limited pH studies. A 1.05 Å resolution X-ray structure of an iminosugar in complex with a glycoside hydrolase has shown that the imine group is diprotonated and cationic whereas proximal active-site carboxyl groups are deprotonated and anionic [20]. Also, a 1.08 Å resolution structure of another glycoside hydrolase in complex with an iminosugar could not resolve the protonation state of the imine, but showed active-site carboxyl groups proximal to the imine as deprotonated and anionic [21]. Although determined at lower resolution, X-ray structures of glycoside hydrolases in complex with Tris have shown active-site carboxyl groups in the vicinity of the inhibitor's amine [22,23]. Similarly, the 1.3 Å resolution structure of D-xylosidase/-L-arabinofuranosidase from Selenomonas ruminantium (SXA) in complex with monocationic 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl) methylamino]propane (Bis­Tris propane or BTP) shows nearly equivalent bond lengths from C to O1 and C to O2 of E186, indicating

charge delocalization and that it is the deprotonated (anionic) carboxyl group of E186 that is close (3.36 Å) to the cationic N group of Bis­Tris propane which occupies subsite -1 of the two-subsite

active site. The other N group of Bis Tris propane, when in neutral form, resides in subsite +1 whereas its cationic form is repelled from binding there by the cationic K99 of subsite +1 [24].

Subsite -1, designated by the white circle surrounding -1, comprises more hydrophilic than hydrophobic amino acid side chains, whereas subsite +1, designated by the white circle surrounding +1, comprises more hydrophobic than hydrophilic amino acid side chains. The active site is surrounded by protein except for the entrance on the right hand side, which is exposed to solvent and where small molecules gain access.

Scheme 2. Binding of monosaccharide inhibitors (I and X), aminoalcohols (A), and substrate (S) to SXA (E). E is shown in two pH-dependent forms: catalytically-active, monoanionic form D14-E186H and catalytically-inactive, dianionic form D14-E186-. Aminoalcohols bind only to the D14-E186- form of enzyme and only to subsite -1. E_S and E_I designations indicate that the substrate and inhibitor bind in subsite + 1 and not in subsite - 1 of the D14-E186- enzyme, whereas both subsites +1 and - 1 can be occupied by I, X and S in the D14-E186H enzyme. Ligands do not bind to the diprotonated form of enzyme (D14HE186H).

halodurans, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, which have 53­70% protein sequence identity with SXA, show that the N-terminal half of the 60 kDa proteins compose the 5-bladed -propeller domain [24,33]. The C-terminal half of the proteins composes a -sandwich domain that restricts the size of the cavernous active site to two subsites with a single route of access for small molecules such as substrate (Fig. 1) [24,33]. Previously, we developed the model of Scheme 2 in which the protonation state of the catalytic base (D14, pKa 5.0) and catalytic acid (E186, pKa 7.2) govern binding of monosaccharides: catalyticallyinactive D14HE186H does not bind monosaccharides, and the affinity of monosaccharides can be lower or higher for the catalytically-active D14-E186H than the catalytically-inactive D14-E186- SXA [34]. In reactions containing two monosaccharide inhibitors (I and X), SXA (E), and substrate (S), all potential inhibited enzyme complexes engaging the two-subsite active site (EI, EII, EIS, EIX, EXS, EXX, and EX) have been demonstrated with certain monosaccharides (e.g., L-arabinose); however, certain monosaccharides (e.g., D-glucose) are restricted to forming only an EI inhibited complex. In contrast, Bis­Tris propane has been shown to bind only to the D14-E186- form of SXA [24]. Bis­Tris propane occupies both subsites of the SXA active site and we considered that smaller aminoalcohols could be useful as probes occupying subsite -1 and leaving subsite + 1 open for binding monosaccharides and other inhibitors. Subsite -1 comprises mainly hydrophilic amino acid side chains, whereas subsite +1 comprises mainly hydrophobic side chains (Fig. 1). Here, we extend the model of Scheme 2 to include inhibition of SXA-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4NPA and 4NPX (Scheme 3) by the aminoalcohols of Scheme 1. We show that small aminoalcohols bind only in their cationic form, they bind exclusively to subsite -1 and exclusively to the dianionic D14-E186- form of SXA. When subsite -1 is occupied by a small aminoalcohol, monosaccharide inhibitors can have higher affinity for subsite +1 than the unoccupied subsite -1. We show that aminoalcohols, binding in subsite -1, can show competitive, noncompetitive and nearly uncompetitive inhibition versus substrate and the inhibition pattern is dependent on the aminoalcohol­ substrate pair. Also, we employed an aminoalcohol to reveal a small percentage contamination of a site-directed mutant SXA by wildtype-like SXA, and the aminoalcohol was employed to resolve kinetic parameters of the mutant enzyme from those of the wild-type SXAlike contaminant.

On the basis of having 10-fold and greater values for kcat and kcat/ Km with xylooligosaccharide substrates than reported for other xylosidases, SXA is the best catalyst known for promoting hydrolysis of xylooligosaccharides [25,26]. Additionally, SXA exhibits good stabilities with regard to challenges from pH (4.3 and above) and temperature (50 °C and below) [27], and the enzyme is bifunctional having both -D-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) and -L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55) activities on natural (arabinoxylose and xylooligosaccharides) and artificial substrates (4NPA and 4NPX) [25,28,29]. Taken together, SXA is an attractive candidate for use in saccharification of herbaceous biomass (arabinoxylan fraction) to simple sugars for subsequent fermentation to ethanol and other bioproducts [30,31]. The enormous scale of biomass to ethanol processes heightens interest in how inhibitors of SXA-catalyzed reactions interact with its two subsites. SXA shares the common structural feature of GH43 enzymes, a 5bladed -propeller domain that comprises the catalytic acid and the catalytic base [24,32]. The X-ray structures of SXA and the X-ray structures of other GH43 -xylosidases from Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials and general methods 4NPA, 4NPX, inhibitor candidates, and buffers were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Water was purified through a Milli-Q unit (Millipore). All other reagents were reagent grade and high purity. A Cary 50 Bio UV Visible spectrophotometer (Varian), equipped with a thermostatted holder for cuvettes, was used for spectral and kinetic determinations. SXA was cloned from S. ruminantium and expressed in Escherichia coli [28]. SXA was purified to homogeneity (judged by SDS-PAGE analysis) as described [25], with the addition of a final desalting, gel filtration step employing a 2.6 × 30 cm column of Bio-Gel P-6 DG desalting gel (Bio-Rad), equilibrated and developed with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. For crude cell extracts, concentrations of protein were determined from A280 and A260 absorbances [35]. pKa values of aminoalcohols were determined by titrating 20.0 or 30.0 mL solutions containing 10.0 mM aminoalcohol in 0.3 M NaCl at 25 °C with10 L aliquots of standardized 1 M HCl and monitoring pH changes. 2.2. Expression of wild-type SXA and E186A SXA in E. coli K12 strain BW25113 (Keio Collection strain JW0264) E. coli BW25113 deletion strain JW0264 of the Keio collection was obtained from the National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan. The JW0264 deletion strain has the yagH gene encoding a putative xylosidase deleted from the genome [36]. The DE3 lysogen was integrated into the genome of strain JW0264 using a DE3 lysogenization kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI). Strain JW0264 cells containing the DE3 lysogen were made chemically competent and transformed with expression plasmids containing wild-type xsa-pET21, E186A-pET21, or the empty pET21 vector by following published protocols [37]. Individual isolates from each transformation were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired construct. An isolate of each construct was then used for expression. An overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of SOB medium in a 2.8 L Fernbach flask. The culture was incubated at 37 °C and 250 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.5 when it was induced with isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM final concentration). The induction phase continued for 5 h at 37 °C and 250 rpm, after which cells were harvested by centrifugation. SXA and E186A SXA proteins were purified from cell extracts by hydrophobic interaction and anion exchange chromatography as described [25], followed by gel filtration to exchange the proteins into 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. Purified wild-type SXA, produced in the K12 deletion strain, exhibited similar kinetic parameters for acting on 4NPX at pH 7.0 as the purified wild-type SXA [25], produced in BL21 (DE3). Cells containing the empty pET21 vector were broken and taken through the ammonium sulfate step [25], followed by gel filtration to exchange the proteins into 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. 2.3. Construction of wild-type SXA-His and E186A SXA-His The wild-type and E186A mutant were subjected to site directed mutagenesis to place the C-terminal 6× His-Tag of the pET21 vector in frame with the respective SXA clone. The Quick-Change sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to delete the last base of the stop codon using the following primers: 5 CAAGGAACTGGACTGGAATTCGAGCTCCGTCG 3 and 5 CGACGGAGCTCGAATTCCAGTCCAGTTCCTTG 3. Mutagenesis was performed according to manufacturer's instruction and wild-type xsa-pET 21 and E186ApET 21 were used as the templates. Individual clones were isolated and sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation and the correct reading frame. Plasmids containing the desired construct

were used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Individual clones containing the desired construct were isolated and used to express the desired protein in the same manner as described in the paragraph preceding this. Purification of the 6× His-Tag proteins proceeded as described [25] for other SXA proteins except that a His-Tag affinity chromatography step was inserted between hydrophobic interaction chromatography and anion exchange chromatography steps. Protein in buffer P20 (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) was applied to a HisPrep FF 16/10 column (Amersham) equilibrated with buffer P20. The column was developed with 100 mL buffer P20 followed by a 200 mL linear gradient (buffer P20 to 500 mM imidazole in buffer P20). Fractions from the gradient that contained SXA were gel filtered into 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, and subjected to anion exchange chromatography [25]. Ultimately, a gel filtration step exchanged the proteins into 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. Purified wild-type SXA, containing the 6× His-Tag, exhibited similar kinetic parameters for acting on 4NPX at pH 7.0 as the purified wild-type SXA [25], lacking the 6× His-Tag. 2.4. Equilibrium binding of triethanolamine at pH 7.0 and 25 °C Size exclusion chromatography was performed by using a 0.7 × 18 cm column containing Bio-Gel P-6 DG desalting gel (BioRad) equilibrated and developed with 50 M triethanolamine in buffer P100 (100 mM sodium phosphate, I = 0.3 M, pH 7.0) at 25 °C. Protein samples (300 L in buffer P100) were loaded on the column and 20drop fractions were collected in tared tubes. Fraction size was determined by weight. SXA concentration in fractions was determined from the A280 [25,38]. Triethanolamine concentration in fractions was determined by using a DX500 HPLC system with an ED40 electrochemical detector (pulsed amperometry), AS3500 autosampler, PA-1 (4 × 250 mm) anion exchange column, and Chromeleon software (Dionex Corp.). Samples (25 L) were injected onto the column equilibrated with 15 mM NaOH and developed for 3 min with 15 mM NaOH at ~ 25 °C and a flow rate of 1.5 mL min- 1. The column was recycled by a 2 min wash with 0.25 M sodium acetate in 75 mM NaOH followed by 3 min of 15 mM NaOH. Several concentrations of triethanolamine established a standard curve on the same day that experimental samples were analyzed. Heats of binding data were collected by isothermal titration calorimetry using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal). Degassed protein samples in 100 mM sodium phosphate, I = 0.3 M, pH 7.0 (buffer P100), were placed in the instrument's 1.3513 mL reaction cell and titrated at 25 °C by injecting 10 L aliquots from a 250 L syringe that contained triethanolamine in buffer P100. Background heats of dilution were collected in an identical manner, omitting the protein from the samples. After subtracting the background, data were fitted to a single set of binding sites model [39] using the MicroCal ORIGIN software package. 2.5. Enzyme-catalyzed reactions Unless indicated otherwise, reactions were initiated by adding a small aliquot of enzyme (generally 7 L of enzyme diluted into 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and incubated on wet ice or at ~25 °C) to 1-mL, temperature-equilibrated (25 °C) reaction mixtures, which were monitored continuously (Cary spectrophotometer) for 0.3 min or longer at 380 nm (for pH values below 6) or 400 nm (for pH values of 6 and above) for determinations of linear initial rates (steady-state rates). Time required for enzyme addition and mixing was 0.2 min prior to collection of rate data. Described methods were employed for determinations of delta extinction coefficients (product ­ substrate) used for molar conversion for each reaction condition and for end point determinations of 4NPA and 4NPX substrate concentrations [25]; these determinations relied on the reported extinction

coefficient of 18.3 mM- 1cm- 1 at 400 nm for 4-nitrophenol in NaOH [40]. Unless indicated otherwise, buffers of constant ionic strength (I = 0.3 M, adjusted with NaCl) in the complete reaction mixtures were used as indicated: 100 mM succinate-NaOH (pH 4.3­6), 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6­8), 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8­10), and 100 mM sodium glycine (pH 10). When substrate concentrations were varied, [4NPA] was 0.2 to 7.0 mM and [4NPX] was 0.2 to 5.0 mM unless stated otherwise. Values for v and kcat are expressed in moles substrate hydrolyzed per second per mole of enzyme active sites (protomers), the latter calculated from the calculated extinction coefficient of SXA protomers at 280 nm of 129600 M- 1cm- 1 [25,38]. 2.6. Equations Unless indicated otherwise, data were fitted to equations using the computer program Grafit (Erithacus Software) [41]. Simple weighting (constant error) was used for fitting most data; proportional error weighting was used to fit some data (e.g., pH curves).

Derivations of Eqs. 1­9 are provided in Supplementary data. Derivations are for the steady-state reactions with equilibrated dead-end complexes.

a Experiments were designed to determine the significance of the Kis term. Reactions contained varied concentrations of substrates and inhibitors as indicated (Fig. 3; Fig. S1 of Supplementary data) in 100 mM sodium phosphate, I = 0.3 M, pH 7.0 at 25 °C. F test probabilities compare goodness of fit of initial rate data from reactions containing varied 4NPX or 4NPA concentrations with varied inhibitor concentrations to Eq. (2) (no Kis term) and Eq.

The preferred equation is indicated. Parameter values and standard errors of fits to the preferred equation are indicated. When Eq. (2) is the preferred equation, Kis values from fitting the data to Eq. (4) are listed only to show how poorly the parameter is defined.

3.1. Inhibition of SXA catalysis by individual aminoalcohols at pH 7.0 and 25 °C In searching for aminoalcohol inhibitors of SXA catalysis, we followed a path similar to that taken previously for monosaccharide inhibitors [34]. Initially, a collection of compounds was screened against SXA reactions containing 100 mM inhibitor candidate, 1 mM 4NPX, pH 7.0 and 25 °C. The results for inhibitors showing greater than 50% inhibition under the stated conditions are listed in order of inhibitory potency in Table 1 (a more extensive list is in Table S1 of Supplementary data). pH 7.0 was chosen because it is close to pKa 7.2 assigned to the carboxyl group of the catalytic acid (E186) where D14-

3. Results and discussion Previously it has been established that SXA catalyzes hydrolysis of 4NPX and xylobiose with inversion of stereochemistry implicating a single transition state with the catalytic base (D14) serving to activate a water molecule for addition to substrate and the catalytic acid (E186) serving to protonate the leaving group (without involvement of covalent enzyme intermediates) [25]. The enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of a single residue from the nonreducing end of substrate without processivity so that all products of the hydrolysis reaction are removed from the active site before initiating another catalytic cycle. The xylosidase and -arabinofuranosidase activities share the single active site of the SXA protomer. Steady-state kinetic parameters kcat and kcat/Km for SXA acting on 4NPX and 4NPA at 25 °C were modestly (b12%) affected by the viscosity of the reaction media (comparing kinetic parameters determined at relative viscosities (/o) of 1 and 6), strongly suggesting that substrate binding and product release steps are not rate limiting for these substrates in the enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Stopped-flow experiments with SXA acting on 4NPX or 4NPA gave no indication of bursts (or lags) in the production of 4NP, ruling out the possibility of slow release of products limiting the steady-state rates for these substrates. Therefore it is likely that the SXA-catalyzed reactions operate in nearly rapid equilibrium and the Km value approximates the dissociation constant of substrate from enzyme (Ks of Scheme 2). This near equivalence of Ks and Km will be exercised below where we compare Kis (dissociation constant for substrate from of enzyme­inhibitor­substrate complexes, Scheme 2) values to Km values. SXA exists as a mixture homotetramer and homodimer in the experiments described here. However, it has been shown that the two quaternary states of the enzyme maintain similar values for kinetic parameters kcat and kcat/Km [24], and there is no evidence for cooperativity in substrate­saturation curves. Active sites, comprising residues belonging entirely to the same monomer, are far apart from one another and X-ray structures of GH43 -xylosidases from Geobacillus stearothermophilus [33] indicate no gross differences between active sites of free enzyme and enzyme complexed with substrate xylobiose. Therefore, the model does not encompass subunit cooperativity in binding of inhibitors.

Fig. 2. Inhibition of SXA-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4NPA by aminoalcohols and parent alcohols and amines at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Experiments were designed to determine whether or not inhibitors can bind twice to SXA and whether or not a Ki2 term is required in the rate equation. For the parent amine study, initial rates (v) were determined from 1-mL reaction mixtures containing 1.0 mM 4NPA and the indicated levels of inhibitor in 100 mM sodium phosphate (I = 1.0 M) at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. For the other inhibitors, initial rates (v) were determined from 1-mL reaction mixtures containing 1.0 mM 4NPA and the indicated levels of inhibitor in 100 mM sodium phosphate (I = 0.3 M) at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Initial-rate data were fitted to Eq. (2) (without double binding term) and to Eq.(3) (containing a double binding term) with K4NPA of 1.08 mM m set as a constant. F tests indicate the probability that the data fit Eq. (2) as well as Eq. (3): for aminoalcohols (panels a and b), F test probabilities are high (19% and greater) that the data fit Eq. (2) as well as Eq. (3) indicating insignificance of the double binding term; for parent alcohols (panel c), F test probabilities are low (less than 0.1%) indicating significance of the double binding term; for parent amines (panel c), F test probabilities are low (0.2% for 1-aminopropane) indicating significance of the double binding term and high (22% for ethylamine) indicating insignificance of the double binding term. Curves were drawn according to the preferred equation and the fitted parameters listed in Table S2 of Supplementary data.

E186H and D14-E186-, the two forms of SXA known to bind substrates and inhibitors, are in equal concentrations. In the next step of the survey, compounds were run at several concentrations in reactions containing 1 mM 4NPX at pH 7.0 and 25 °C to search for double binding of inhibitors. Unlike cases with certain monosaccharides, where Dixon plots (1/v versus inhibitor concentration) show concave upward curvature suggesting binding of two equivalents of inhibitor per SXA active site [34], Dixon plots of aminoalcohols in Fig. 2 are linear, suggesting that SXA can bind only a single aminoalcohol inhibitor per active site under these conditions. Also, F tests that compare fitting the aminoalcohol data of Fig. 2a and b to Eq. (2) (no double binding term) and Eq. (3) (with double binding term) indicate that there is greater than 19% probability that the data fit Eq. (2) as well as Eq. (3) (Table S2 of Supplementary data). Therefore, under these conditions, the inhibitors of Table 1 bind singly but not doubly to SXA (form EA complexes of Scheme 2 but not EAA complexes), which is consistent with the view that the cationic N groups of the compounds are attracted to the anionic carboxyl group of E186 in subsite -1 and they are repelled by the cationic N group of K99 in subsite +1. In contrast, parent alcohols ethanol and 2-hydroxylpropane can bind two equivalents per SXA protomer (Fig. 2c; Table S2 of Supplementary data); F tests indicate 0.00% probability that the inhibition data fit Eq. (2) (single binding) as well as Eq. (3) (double binding). The inhibition constant for binding the first equivalent of ethanol (Ki = 2.4 M) is similar to that of the second equivalent (Ki2 = 1.8 M). The inhibition constant for binding the first equivalent of 2-hydroxylpropane (Ki = 1.4 M) is similar to that of the second equivalent (Ki2 = 0.9 M). Due to weak inhibition by parent amines, inhibition experiments replaced I of 0.3 M with I of 1.0 M in reactions to accommodate high concentrations of the amines. Parent amine, 1aminopropane, can bind two equivalents per SXA active site whereas parent amine, ethylamine, binds only one equivalent: respective F tests indicate 0.7% and 22% probability that the inhibition data fit Eq. (2) (single binding) as well as Eq. (3) (double binding). The inhibition constant for binding the first equivalent of 1-aminopropane (Ki = 0.5 M) is one seventh that of the second equivalent (Ki2 = 3.4 M). The inhibition

constant for binding ethylamine (Ki = 0.7 M) is similar in magnitude to the Ki for the first equivalent of 1-aminopropane. Thus, according to our favored binding model, the amines are repelled from binding in subsite +1 by the cationic N group of K99 in subsite +1 in similar fashion as the aminoalcohols. Most notably, binding of parent amines and parent alcohols is much weaker (at least 200-fold) than the corresponding aminoalcohols. In the third step of the survey, we searched for aminoalcohols that can form enzyme aminoalcohol­substrate complexes (EAS, Scheme 2), which requires initial-rate data for reactions containing varying concentrations of inhibitor and substrate, fitting the data to Eq. (2) (no Kis term for dissociating EAS) and Eq. (4) (with Kis term for EAS), and making F test comparisons of the fits. When 4NPX is the substrate, with the exception of Bis­Tris propane, F tests support the formation of enzyme­aminoalcohol­4NPX complexes with all of the compounds of Table 1. When Bis­Tris propane (pKa's of N groups are 7 and 9) is bound at pH 7.0 to the SXA active site, it is very likely in the monocationic form with subsite -1 of SXA occupied by the cationic N of BTP and subsite +1 occupied by the neutral N of BTP [24]. Clearly, occupation of both subsites by a single inhibitor precludes formation of an EAS complex. In contrast, only about half of the monosaccharide inhibitors tested could form enzyme­monosaccharide­substrate complexes when 4NPX or 4NPA was substrate [34]; also, the dissociation constants (Kis values) for substrates 4NPX and 4NPA from the enzyme­monosaccharide­substrate complexes are all considerably larger (9-fold to infinity) than the corresponding Km values, whereas Kis values for 4NPX from enzyme­aminoalcohol­4NPX complexes range from 0.15- to 100-fold that of K4NPX (0.38 mM) m (Table 1) (Note that above we indicated steady-state Km values are considered nearly equivalent to rapid-equilibrium Ks values for SXA). Thus, double reciprocal plots (1/v versus 1/S) at varying levels of aminoalcohol inhibitors can show patterns that appear nearly competitive, clearly noncompetitive, and nearly uncompetitive when 4NPX is substrate, even though they are all noncompetitive mathematically and they all bind in part of the same space

Experiments were designed to distinguish between aminoalcohol inhibitors that form and do not form EAS complexes (Scheme 2) and whether or not a Kis term is required in the rate equations. Curves of double-reciprocal plots were generated by using fitted parameters listed in Table 1 that were determined by fitting the initial-rate data to Eq. (2) (no Kis term) or Eq. (4) (with Kis term). Inhibitor and substrate concentrations are indicated. (a) Substrate 4NPX. (b) Substrate 4NPA.

a Experiments were designed to distinguish between inhibitors that form and do not form EAS complexes (Scheme 2) and whether or not a Kis term is required in the rate equations. Reactions for determination of initial rates contained varied substrate and inhibitor concentrations in 100 mM sodium phosphate, I = 0.3 M, pH 7.0 at 25 °C. F test probabilities evaluate whether the data fit Eq. (2) (no Kis term) as well as Eq. (4) (containing Kis term for dissociation of EAS, Scheme 2) or Eq. (3) (no Kis term; containing Ki2 term for dissociation of EII, Scheme 2) as well as Eq. (5) (containing Kis term and Ki2 term). The preferred equations are indicated. NA, not applicable because term is absent from the preferred equation. Data for 1-aminopropane do not fit well to Eq. (5) (includes double binding term Ki2) because the highest inhibitor concentration was less than 3% of the Ki2 value of 3.4 M (Fig. 2; Table S2 of Supplementary data). Parameter values and standard errors from fits to preferred equations are indicated. Primary data are plotted in Fig. S2 of Supplementary data.

as productively-bound 4NPX. A scale of nearly uncompetitive to nearly competitive follows the 1/Kis values with the trend uncompetitive N ethanolamine N diethanolamine = 1-amino-2-propanol N Tris = Tricine N triethanolamine = Bis­Tris N competitive (Table 1, Fig. 3 and Fig. S1 of Supplementary data). When 4NPA is substrate only one of the inhibitors of Table 1 (1-amino-2-propanol) forms an enzyme­ aminoalcohol­4NPA complex and the Kis value is 20-fold larger than the corresponding K4NPA (1.08 mM) (Table 1), indicating that the m arabinofuranose moiety of 4NPA has low affinity for subsite +1 as has been discussed before with respect to monosaccharide inhibitors [34] and pH profiles [25,34]. All of the compounds of Table 1 display double reciprocal plots (1/v versus 1/4NPA) at varying levels of inhibitors that appear competitive even though one is noncompetitive mathematically (Fig. 3b and Fig. S1b of Supplementary data). Ki values for the aminoalcohols are similar when 4NPX and 4NPA are substrates, and, consequently the two substrates share the same ordering of inhibitor potency at pH 7.0: triethanolamine N diethanolamine N ethanolamine N 1-amino-2-propanol N Tris = Bis­Tris N Bis Tris propane N Tricine. The affinity trend triethanolamine N diethanolamine N ethanolamine is most likely attributed to the hydrogen bonding capability of the ethanolic substituents. Although the three aminoalcohols are predominately cationic at pH

7.0, we cannot rule out the possibility that the basicity of triethanolamine (pKa 8.0), diethanolamine (pKa 8.9), and ethanolamine (pKa 9.6) influences the affinity trend. At pH 7.0 and 25 °C, parent amines, ethylamine and 1-aminopropane, and parent alcohols, ethanol and 2-hydroxypropane, appear noncompetitive with respect to substrate 4NPX and the determined Kis values span from 0.5-fold to 6-fold that of K4NPX (Table 2; Fig. S2 of Supplementary data). In contrast, m ethanol is a competitive inhibitor with respect to substrate 4NPA, consistent with our model in which 4NPX can bind well to subsite +1 and 4NPA cannot [34]. It is noted that higher concentrations of ethanol and 2-hydroxypropane than those used in experiments described here can denature SXA. Weak binding by parent alcohols and amines indicates that neither functionality dominates in providing binding potency that resides in the aminoalcohol offspring. 3.2. Inhibition of SXA catalysis by mixtures of two inhibitors at pH 7.0 and 25 °C Dixon plots of inhibition patterns when two competitive inhibitors are varied in reactions were used to decide whether pairs of inhibitors bind exclusively or nonexclusively to SXA (Fig. 4, Table 3; Fig. S3 of Supplementary data). Substrate 4NPA at 1.0 mM (b0.05 × Kis) was used

a Experiments were designed to determine whether two inhibitors bind exclusively or nonexclusively and whether the value of  is infinite or finite in the rate equation. SXA competitive inhibition constants were determined from reactions containing 100 mM sodium phosphate, I = 0.3 M, pH 7.0, 1 mM 4NPA, varying concentrations of inhibitor I and inhibitor A at 25 °C. Mean kcat value from fitting data to preferred equations is 3.08 ± 0.18 s- 1. Parameter values and standard errors from fitting data to preferred equations are indicated. NA, not applicable because term is absent from the preferred equation. Aminoalcohols (Inhibitor A) bind singly to enzyme. b Significance of the  term was evaluated by fitting data from the same experiment to the indicated two equations containing or lacking the  term and subjecting the two fittings to an F test: Eq. (6) (lacking ) and Eqs. (7) (containing ) or (8) (lacking ) and Eq. (9) (containing ); in all cases reported here, the % probability refers to the probability that the data fit the equation lacking the  term as well as the equation containing the term -- the preferred equation is indicated. Conclusions based on preferred equation: E, exclusive binding (forms EI and EA); NE, nonexclusive binding (forms EI, EA, and EAI); SBI, single binding I (forms EI); DBI, double binding I (forms EI and EII). When Eq. (6) is the preferred equation,  values from fitting data to Eq. (7) are listed only to show how poorly the parameter is defined.

in the reactions to avoid formation of enzyme­aminoalcohol­4NPA complexes. F tests comparing data fits to Eqs. (6) or (8) (no  term) and Eqs. (7) or (9) (with  term) were used to determine whether or not the  term is significant (i.e., finite). When  is 1.0, the inhibitors have the same Ki values from the binary complexes (EI and EA) as from the ternary complex (EAI). When  is less than and greater than 1, Ki values from the ternary complexes are proportionally lower and higher, respectively, than from the binary complexes. With the exceptions of triethanolamine pairing with D-xylose, Dglucose, and D-arabinose, other pairs of aminoalcohols with monosaccharides have significant values for  according to F test comparisons (Table 3). The  values are less than 1 for ethanolamine and 1-amino-2-propanol when the second inhibitor is a monosaccharide and they are greater than 1 for the other aminoalcohols when the second inhibitor is a monosaccharide. Among the aminoalcohols paired with monosaccharides, the trend in the value for  is ethanolamine b 1-amino-2-propanol b Tris b diethanolamine b triethanolamine, indicating that the smaller aminoalcohols (occupying subsite -1) are better than the larger ones in accommodating occupation of subsite + 1 by the monosaccharides according to our favored model. When mixtures of two inhibitors are two aminoalcohols,  is either insignificant or very large and not well determined. Therefore, aminoalcohols bind weakly or not at all to subsite +1.

3.3. Influence of pH on binding aminoalcohols by SXA at 25 °C Previously, the pH dependence of Bis­Tris propane binding to SXA was fitted to a model in which the monocationic form of inhibitor binds to the dianionic (D14-E186-) SXA [24]. The 1.3 Å structure of the SXA­BTP complex strongly suggests that D14 and E186 are deprotonated, thus removing the ambiguity associated with modeling this system -- the eliminated model (reverse protonation model that is statistically identical) has the neutral form of BTP binding to the monoanionic (D14-E186H) SXA. To further examine the favored model, pH data for inhibition of SXA by aminoalcohols were collected for aminoalcohols that have a single protonatable group with pKa values that span 2 pH units (Fig. 5; log­log plots are shown in Fig. S4 of Supplementary data). As seen, the 1/Ki values at varied pH fit the favored model well with pKa 7 on the acidic limb assigned to the carboxyl group of E186 and the pKa on the alkaline limb assigned to the N group of the aminoalcohol. Further, we interrogated the data to see whether the protonation state of D14 contributed to the binding of aminoalcohols by comparing the fit to Eq. (16) (no Ka(enz1) term for D14) to the fit to Eq. (17) (with Ka(enz1) term for D14) (Table 4). Clearly, the carboxyl group of D14 (pKa 5.0) is mainly deprotonated, along with most carboxyl groups of SXA, whenever the carboxyl group of E186 (pKa 7.2) is substantially deprotonated; the question asked is whether the carboxyl group of D14 affects the binding affinity of SXA for

Fig. 5. Influence of pH on inhibition of SXA-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4NPA and 4NPX by aminoalcohols at 25 °C. Solid curves were generated by fitting the Ki values to Eq. (15) (including Ka1(enz) term assigned to D14). Dotted curves were generated by fitting the data to Eq. (14) (no Ka1(enz) term). Fitted parameters are listed in Table 4. Log­log plots of the same data are presented in Fig. S4 of Supplementary data.

aminoalcohols. For ethanolamine and triethanolamine, data were collected at pH 4.3, which is the lowest pH tolerated by SXA without the occurrence of acid denaturation [27]. F test probabilities are low that their pH profiles fit Eq. (16) as well as Eq. (17), indicating that the Ka(enz1) term is significant and that the deprotonated D14 is required for binding these aminoalcohols. In the case of Tris, pH 4.3 could not be included in the pH profiles for inhibitor binding because the Ki value is too large (N1 M at pH 4.3) to determine accurately within the limitation of 0.3 M ionic strength of the reaction mixtures. Therefore, from the best data available, it is concluded that the Ka(enz1) term governing the protonation state of D14 is necessary in describing inhibition of SXA by aminoalcohols. Notably, pKa values for inhibitors on the enzyme, as determined from the preferred model of Eq. (17), are 0.5 U higher than those determined off the enzyme for ethanolamine, Tris, and triethanolamine. It is considered that the anionic subsite -1 of the D14-E186- enzyme raises the pKa of inhibitor amino groups binding to the enzyme over that of the amino groups in water.

3.4. Influence of E186A mutation of SXA on inhibition by triethanolamine at 25 °C In the X-ray structure of SXA complexed with Bis­Tris propane the ionized carboxyl group of E186 lies 3.36 Å from the N of BTP in subsite -1 and the carboxylate side chain likely contributes significantly to binding the aminoalcohol. Previously, E186A SXA was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3), containing the pET21(+) plasmid encoding for the mutant SXA, and found to have 10,000-fold lower k4NPX, but similar cat K4NPX as wild-type SXA [25]. Inhibition of the E186A SXA mutant by m triethanolamine (TEA) at the low substrate concentration of 51 M 4NPX at pH 8.0 and 25 °C, displayed as a Dixon plot of 1/v versus [TEA], reveals a biphasic response to TEA concentration (Fig. 6). The inhibition data fit well to Eq. (10), which describes inhibition of a mixture of two distinct enzymes with one enzyme having an apparent KTEA of 81 M and uninhibited rate venz1 of 3.37 × 10- 5 s- 1 and the i(enz1) other enzyme having an apparent KTEA of 36 mM and uninhibited i(enz2) rate venz2 of 3.44 × 10- 5 s- 1 (Table 5).

Reactions were monitored at 400 nm for 20­35 min for determination of initial rates. Curves were drawn from the kinetic data fitted to Eq. (11): kcat(enz1) = (3.30 ± 0.07) × 10- 3 s- 1, kcat(enz1)/Km(enz1) = (8.94 ± 0.19) × 10- 4 s- 1mM- 1, Km(enz1) = 3.69 ± 0.15 mM, Ki(enz1) = 0.129 ± 0.004 mM; kcat(enz2) = (1.54 ± 0.02) × 10- 3 s- 1, kcat(enz2)/Km(enz2) = (5.96 ± 0.10) × 10- 4 s- 1mM- 1, Km(enz2) = 2.59 ± 0.07 mM, Ki(enz2) = 136 ± 9 mM.

Previously, we examined whether the E. coli BL21(DE3) production strain, lacking the SXA gene in the plasmid, had intrinsic -xylosidase activity and concluded that there was very little, if any, glycoside hydrolase acting on 4NPX. This assessment was confirmed from cell extracts of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, containing the empty pET21(+) vector, taken through the ammonium sulfate step of protein purification [25] followed by gel filtration/buffer exchange into 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3: specific activity of the extract was 4.5 × 10- 5 mol 4NP produced/min/mg protein when assayed in reaction mixtures containing 5 mM 4NPX in 100 mM sodium phosphate, I = 0.3 M, pH 7.0 at 25 °C. This is 3 × 105-fold lower than homogeneous wild-type SXA determined in the same way (14 mol 4NP produced/min/mg protein) and 30-fold lower than previously reported for purified E186A SXA produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the pET21(+) vector complete with the gene encoding the E186A mutation of SXA [25]. Pursuing a strategy to lower the background 4NPX-hydrolysis rate, we purified the E186A SXA from E. coli K12 BW25113 (-xylosidase deletion strain JW0264) cells, transformed with the pET21(+) plasmid encoding for E186A SXA. Background -xylosidase activity was low in cell extracts of E. coli K12 BW25113 (-xylosidase deletion strain JW0264) cells, containing the empty pET21(+) vector, taken through the ammonium sulfate step of protein purification [25] and buffer exchanged into 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3: specific activity of the extract was 1.0 × 10- 5 mol 4NP produced/min/mg protein when assayed in reaction mixtures containing 5 mM 4NPX in 100 mM sodium phosphate, I = 0.3 M, pH 7.0 at 25 °C (one forth that of the background activity in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the empty pET21(+) vector). Also, we prepared E186A SXA with a 6× His tag appended to its C terminus (produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells) which facilitated addition of an affinity step to the purification protocol for the mutant SXA for removing contaminants catalyzing the hydrolysis of 4NPX.

As seen in Fig. 6, the purified E186A SXA produced in E. coli K12 BW25113 (-xylosidase deletion strain JW0264) cells (prep. 2) and the purified E186A SXA(His)6 (prep. 3) enzymes produce biphasic responses to inhibition by TEA, similar to that of the purified E186A enzyme produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the plasmid encoding E186A (prep. 1). Also, from initial rates of reactions containing varied [TEA] and 51 M 4NPX at pH 8.0 and 25 °C fitted to Eq. (10), determined values for parameters KTEA , KTEA , and i(enz1) i(enz2) venz2 are similar among the three enzyme preparations, whereas the determined value for venz1 is 3-fold higher for prep. 1 than those of preps. 2 and 3 (Table 5). Ki(enz1)(app) values (80, 110, and 150 M) of the three preparations are similar to the KTEA value (92 ± 3 M) of wildi type SXA determined at pH 8.0 and 25 °C. Ki(enz2)(app) values (~37 mM) are 400-fold larger. Further experiments on the E186A mutation were performed on the protein produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) (prep. 1). Kinetic parameters of enzyme 1 (TEA sensitive) and enzyme 2 (TEA insensitive) were isolated and determined at pH 7.0 and 25 °C by varying concentrations of 4NPX and TEA (Fig. 7). KTEA of 0.129 mM for the TEA-sensitive i enzyme 1 is similar to the value (0.109 mM, Table 1) determined for wild-type SXA. KTEA of 136 mM for the TEA-insensitive enzyme 2 is i 1000-fold larger. If wild-type SXA were the TEA-sensitive (enzyme1) contaminant in the E186A­SXA preparations, its mass would constitute 0.023% of the protein of prep. 1, as calculated by dividing the kcat(enz1) value of 3.3 × 10- 3 s- 1 (Fig. 7) by the kcat value of 14.4 s- 1 for wild-type SXA at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Such a small percentage of contamination would not contribute significantly to the equilibrium binding experiments with E186A, described by Figs. 8 and 9. In Fig. 8, isothermal calorimetry was applied to the determination of thermodynamic parameters of TEA binding to wild-type SXA and E186A SXA

iminosugars with a -glucosidase [42], and emphasizes the enthalpic contribution from the interaction between the inhibitor N group and enzyme carboxyl group and the control of Kd (G°) by the entropy term (S°) -- negative in the case of SXA binding TEA and positive or near zero in the cases of the -glucosidase binding the iminosugars. The experiment with E186A SXA (Fig. 8b) indicates that there is no significant report of TEA binding to the protein under these conditions, consistent with the large KTEA i(enz2) of 136 mM at pH 7.0 (Fig. 7). The gel-filtration, equilibrium binding study conducted at the free concentration of 50 M TEA determined binding stoichiometries (TEA bound/SXA protomer) of 0.29 for wild-type SXA (Fig. 9a) and 0 for E186­SXA (Fig. 9b). The value of zero confirms that the binding constant for triethanolamine (KTEA = 136 mM at pH 7.0) is i(enz2) weak for E186A SXA. From the relationship KTEA = (stoichiometry- 1 d - 1)[TEA], the determined stoichiometry of 0.29 for wild-type SXA equates to the KTEA of 120 M, similar to the KTEA of 109 M d i determined at pH 7.0 (Table 1). An experiment with the gel filtration column equilibrated with 100 M TEA in 100 mM sodium phosphate, I = 0.3 M, at pH 7.0 and 25 °C determined a stoichiometry of 0.47 TEA bound/SXA protomer, which equates to the KTEA of 113 M. It is d concluded that the E186A SXA preparations comprise two enzymes: E186A SXA, which has low affinity for TEA, and a minor contamination, which has high affinity for TEA and behaves as if it were wildtype SXA. It seems unlikely that the high-affinity contaminating activity derives from the E. coli proteome because it copurifies with the E186A(His)6 enzyme through the His-Tag affinity chromatography step. The minor contaminating activity most likely derives from translational misreading errors (missense errors) in E. coli, which are

The determined -8.17 ± 0.028 kcal/mol for H° is similar to the values reported for interactions between both tight-binding (Kd = 10 nM) and weaker binding (Kd = 450 nM)

pKa values that maintain good buffering capacity and nearly constant ionic strength over wide ranges of pH that are convenient for use in collecting data for pH profiles [44]. To examine the effect of a multicomponent buffering system containing Tris on determined pH dependencies of kcat, kcat/Km, and 1/Km of wild-type SXA acting on 4NPX and 4NPA, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters in a buffering system containing Tris (100 mM Tris, 50 mM Mes, 50 mM acetic acid, 33 mM sodium sulfate, pH adjusted with H2SO4 or NaOH) for comparison with steady-state kinetic parameters determined in the absence of Tris: 100 mM sodium succinate (pH 4.3­6.0), 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6­8), 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8­10), or 100 mM sodium glycine (pH 10); all with I = 0.3 M,

reported to occur at frequencies of 10- 4 to greater than 10- 3 per codon [43]. Most notably, kcat and kcat/Km for E186A (TEA-insensitive) acting on 4NPX at pH 7.0 and 25 °C are respectively 9400-fold and 60,000-fold lower than those of wild-type SXA, indicating the importance to catalysis of the native residue. At pH 7.0 and 25 °C, the Ki for TEA by E186A is 1200-fold larger than that of wild-type SXA, indicating the importance of the native residue to binding aminoalcohols. 3.5.

adjusted with NaCl. As seen in Fig. 10 (4NPA), Fig. 11 (4NPX), and Table 6 (4NPA and 4NPX), pH profiles of the kinetic parameters are very different between the two buffering systems. In general, the pH curves are pushed to the acidic side by the inclusion of Tris in reaction mixtures, consistent with the cationic Tris binding the catalyticallyinactive, D14-E186- enzyme form and not the catalytically-active D14- E186H enzyme form. The most outstanding difference between the two buffering systems is seen in the (1/Km)4NPX pH profile where Tris effects replacement of pKa 4.9 and pKa 6.8 that govern the acidic limb with a single pKa 5.9 that governs an alkaline limb (Fig. 11, Table 6). 4. Summary and conclusion Going into this work, we knew that SXA in its dianionic form (D14- E186-) binds Bis Tris propane [24]: the electron density of the D14 and E186 carboxyl groups are delocalized in the SXA­BTP complex. In this work we have extended the pH profiles with more data points and simpler aminoalcohol inhibitors (single amine functionality) to substantiate the model where the cationic form of aminoalcohols binds only to the D14-E186- form of SXA and that the protonation states of both D14 and E186 are needed in the binding equation. This model is consistent with the models developed for binding substrates and monosaccharide inhibitors where pKa values of D14 (pKa 5.0) and E186 (pKa 7.2) are required in the binding equations [25,34]. Currently, cationic aminoalcohols are the only compounds known to bind exclusively to the catalytically-inactive D14-E186- form of SXA and not to the catalytically-active D14-E186H form of the enzyme. Parental amines and parental alcohols bind weakly to the enzyme, indicating that both N and OH functionalities are required for strong binding. Our model for ethanolamine bound to SXA has the cationic amino group of inhibitor interacting with the anionic carboxyl group of E186 and the OH group of inhibitor interacting with the anionic carboxyl group of D14. This leaves subsite +1 fully exposed for binding other ligands (e.g, monosaccharides). Larger aminoalcohols (e.g., triethanolamine) bind similarly within subsite -1, but extend extra substituents into subsite +1 leaving less space for other ligands to bind there. Linkages of appropriate aminoalcohols and monosaccharides into single molecules could yield potent inhibitors that occupy both subsites -1 and +1 of SXA, just as the more potent iminosugar inhibitors of other glycoside hydrolases possess monosaccharide substituents. In a sense, SXA has the simplest active site available to glycoside hydrolases: two subsites with a single route of access. Ligands must pass through subsite +1 to reach subsite -1. Thus, inhibitors that occupy subsite +1 will prevent access to subsite -1 and act as strictly

competitive inhibitors, as demonstrated by competitive inhibition versus 4NPX by D-ribose at high pH [34]. Active-site inhibitors that occupy subsite -1 and leave subsite +1 unoccupied will act as noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to substrate if the substrate has affinity for subsite +1 enabling formation of enzyme­inhibitor­substrate complexes, as demonstrated by aminoalcohol inhibition of SXA catalysis (noncompetitive versus 4NPX and competitive versus 4NPA). Most glycoside hydrolase active sites have more than two subsites providing greater opportunity for formation of enzyme­inhibitor­ substrate complexes and noncompetitive inhibition patterns. However, current and older literature furnish numerous examples in which noncompetitive inhibition of glycoside hydrolase is ascribed to inhibitor (aminoalcohols and iminosugars) binding to allosteric or regulatory sites. Perhaps, this work will prompt consideration of the more likely mechanism of concurrent occupation by inhibitor and substrate of different subsites within the same active site. As well, greater attention devoted to detecting noncompetitive inhibition patterns for inhibitors that are known to bind to the active sites of glycoside hydrolases could provide benefits. Certainly, noncompetitive inhibitors can offer enhanced performance over competitive inhibitors in situ. The effects illustrated by Figs. 10 and 11 should discourage the use of aminoalcohols as pH buffers of glycoside hydrolase reactions unless they are known not to bind to the enzyme and distort kinetics. Even in the relatively limited arena of GH43 -D-xylosidase/-L-arabinofuranosidase literature of recent years, there are two enzymes, studied by two independent laboratories, which have been characterized kinetically from reactions that included Tris as the pH buffer for the reactions or carried over significant concentrations of Tris to reaction mixtures by the addition of enzyme solution containing Tris. Aside from the aforementioned hazard associated with aminoalcohols, the compounds can be useful experimental tools in the study of glycoside hydrolases, as the revelation of contamination of the E186A SXA preparations by wildtype-like SXA demonstrates. In addition, currently, we are finding aminoalcohols useful in follow-up experiments involving the previously-revealed slow binding of L-arabinose to SXA [34]. Exclusive binding of cationic aminoalcohols to subsite -1, due to the affinity of deprotonated E186 for the positively charged N group of aminoalcohols and to repulsion of the same N group by the positively charged N of K99, provides a convenient means for binding ligands exclusively to subsite +1. Although subsite +1 is mainly occupied by hydrophobic amino acid side chains, monosaccharides have been shown here to have greater affinity for subsite +1 than for the more hydrophilic subsite -1. Binding to subsite +1 imparts important influence on catalysis as inferred from the 5-fold greater kcat for -D-xylobiose than for 4NPX [26]. Also, the more hydrophobic subsite +1 allows for greater flexibility in substrate recognition, which is needed by SXA acting on natural substrates, 1,4--D-xylobiose, 1,2--L-arabinofurano-D-xylose, and 1,3-L-arabinofurano-D-xylose. Hence, residues of subsite +1 as well as those of subsite -1 are potential targets for mutagenesis efforts aimed at producing enhanced-performance enzymes with lower affinity for monosaccharides that accumulate under saccharification processes. Aminoalcohols can be used to pinpoint the subsite affected by the mutations. More broadly, aminoalcohols should have utility in dissecting binding modes of inhibitors in the active sites of other glycoside hydrolases.
