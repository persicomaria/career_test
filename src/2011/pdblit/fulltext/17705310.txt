The lack of absolute prokaryotic selectivity of natural antibiotics is widespread and is a significant clinical problem. The use of this disadvantage of aminoglycoside antibiotics for the possible treatment of human genetic diseases is extremely challenging. Here, we have used a combination of biochemical and structural analysis to compare and contrast the molecular mechanisms of action and the structure≠activity relationships of a new synthetic aminoglycoside, NB33, and a structurally similar natural aminoglycoside apramycin. The data presented herein demonstrate the general molecular principles that determine the decreased selectivity of apramycin for the prokaryotic decoding site, and the ACHTUNGREincreased selectivity of NB33 for the eukaryotic decoding site. These results are therefore extremely beneficial for further research on both the design of new aminoglycoside-based antibiotics with diminished deleterious effects on humans, as well as the design of new aminoglycoside-based structures that selectively target the eukaryotic ribosome.

Introduction
2-Deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) aminoglycosides are a class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents that contain 2-DOS as a common ring, to which are attached one or more amino sugars via glycosidic linkage(s) (Scheme 1). These antibiotics exert their antimicrobial activity by selectively recognizing and binding to the decoding A site on the 16S subunit of the bacterial rRNA,[1] by inducing deleterious misreading of the genetic code, and by inhibiting protein translation.[2] Although a prokaryotic selectivity of action is critical to the therapeutic utility of 2-DOS aminoglycosides as antibiotics, they are not entirely selective for the bacterial ribosome; they also bind to the eukaryotic A site[3] and promote mistranslation.[4] In fact, this lack of selectivity has been exploited since certain aminoglycosides were suggested as a treatment for genetic diseases that result from nonsense mutations.[5, 6] Numerous experiments in tissue culture cells, in animal models, and in clinical trials confirm the ability of aminoglycosides to induce mammalian ribosomes to readthrough disease-causing stop codon mutations and to generate full-length functional proteins in several genetic disorders.[5≠7] However, the low specificity of clinical aminoglycosides to mammalian ribosome necessitates their use in high quantity, which in turn causes deleterious toxic effects, and hence, largely limits their therapeutic utility to cure genetic diseases.[6] In addition, while the molecular mechanisms of aminoglycosideinduced miscoding in prokaryotic systems are presently well investigated,[8] the molecular mechanisms of aminoglycosideinduced nonsense mutation suppression and translation inhibition in mammalian cells are largely debated. Clearly, mammalian ribosome target-specific aminoglycosides with complementary structural and mechanistic information should greatly aid to extrapolate the approach to the point where it can actually help patients. Toward these ends, we have recently reported a new series of paromamine (rings I and II of paromomycin, Scheme 1) derivatives that were designed for better readthrough activity performance.[9] One of these structures, compound NB30 (Scheme 1), showed markedly higher stop-codon-readthrough activity in cultured mammalian cells compared to that of paromomycin and gentamicin. The other new structure, NB33, (Scheme 1), has no significant readthrough activity, but it

Differential Selectivity to Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Decoding A Sites

Results and Discussion
Comparative translation inhibition and binding affinities study of 2-DOS aminoglycosides in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems Initially we tested a series of different 4-, 4,5- and 4,6-substituted 2-DOS aminoglycosides for the inhibition of protein translation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, by using an in vitro luciferase assay (Figure 1, Table 1).[12] The measured half-

Compounds NB30 and NB33 are semisynthetic paromomycin derivatives.[9] The 2-deoxystreptamine moiety shared by all structures is colored red.

strongly inhibited translation. Interestingly, neither NB30 nor NB33 retained the known antibacterial activity of the parent paromomycin; this indicates increased selectivity of action of these synthetic derivatives toward eukaryotic versus prokaryotic ribosome. Recently, we solved the crystal structures of the human cytoplasmic A site with and without the aminoglycoside apramycin (Scheme 1).[10, 11] These structures suggest that the molecular decoding mechanism is likely to be conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but that the translation inhibition mechanism appears to be different; the aminoglycoside apramycin specifically binds and stabilizes the nondecoding "off" state of the ACHTUNGREcytoplasmic A site thereby probably inhibiting translocation of the eukaryotic ribosome instead of disturbing decoding fidelity. Based on these data, we hypothesized that since both NB33 and apramycin are monosubstituted 2-DOS derivatives, and this feature distinguishes them from other aminoglycosides, it is likely that this common structural motif is the main determinant for their unique action on the eukaryotic versus the prokaryotic ribosome. To support this hypothesis, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of NB33 in complex with the human cytoplasmic decoding site oligonucleotide, and performed a series of comparative binding and translation inhibition studies between NB33 and various relevant 2-DOS aminoglycosides in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation inhibition was quantified in coupled transcription/translation assays by using active luciferase detection. The percentages of active luciferase are plotted as functions of drug concentration. Each data point represents the average of 2≠3 independent experimental results.

maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values showed that all of the tested aminoglycosides inhibit translation in eukaryotes, although the majority of the compounds had a roughly two to three order of magnitude preference for inhibiting translation in prokaryotes versus eukaryotes. A noteworthy exception to this trend is NB33, whose antitranslational activity in eukaryotes (IC50 = 2.4 mm) is only 2.2-fold less than that in prokaryotes (IC50 = 1.1 mm). Furthermore, the efficacy with which

[a] The Ka values for NB33 were derived (by using a previously detailed approach[13, 14]) from the fluorescence profiles shown in Figure 2. The Ka values for paromomycin were taken from ref. [13]. The Ka value for the NB30 interaction with the prokaryotic rRNA A site was determined by fluorescence (profile not shown), while the corresponding Ka value for the NB30 interaction with the human rRNA A site was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as previously described.[13] [b] The half-maximal concentration (IC50) values were obtained from fitting concentration response curves (Figure 1) to the data of at least two independent experiments, by using Grafit 5 software.[33]

NB33 inhibits eukaryotic translation is greater than that of the other two paromamine-containing aminoglycosides NB30 (IC50 = 31 mm) and paromomycin (IC50 = 57 mm). These collective results indicate that NB33 is more selective for eukaryotic ribosomes than other paromamine-containing aminoglycosides. The unique selectivity that is exhibited by NB33 for eukaryotic ribosomes might reflect a distinct mode of recognition. As a first step toward assessing the veracity of this hypothesis, we compared the affinities with which NB33 and NB30 bind to RNA hairpin constructs that model the human and E. coli rRNA A sites.[13] We derived the relevant drug≠RNA association constants (Ka) by using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and steady-state fluorescence techniques (FigACHTUNGREure 2) that we have previously established.[13, 14] The resulting Ka values are listed in Table 1. NB30 binds to the bacterial A site sequence (Ka = 2.0  104 m¿1) with 4.2-fold greater affinity than the human A site sequence (Ka = 4.7  103 m¿1). We have previously shown that paromomycin exhibits a similar binding specificity.[13] In striking contrast to NB30, NB33 exhibits a 1.4-fold higher affinity for the human A site sequence (Ka = 2.5  105 m¿1) than the bacterial A site sequence (Ka = 1.8  105 m¿1); this observation suggests that NB33 recognizes the human A site sequence via a distinct mode of interaction (vide infra). Furthermore, it is likely that the enhanced affinity of NB33 for the human versus the bacterial A site contributes, at least in part, to the observed antitranslational selectivity of the compound for eukaryotic versus prokaryotic ribosomes. Interestingly, a similar eukaryotic A site-preferential binding was previously reported by mass spectrometry studies for the 2-DOS aminoglycoside apramycin.[15] Further crystallographic investigations of apramycin complexes with both the bacterial[16] and human cytoplasmic decoding site[10, 17] constructs revealed that apramycin binds to the human RNA in a fashion very distinct from its binding to the bacterial site: it penetrates the internal loop of the bacterial A site and stabilizes the decoding "on" state conformation, which features two critical ACHTUNGREadenine residues A1492 and A1493 bulged out, while in the human A site it stabilizes the nondecoding "off" state conformation (A1491/A1493 bulging out and A1492 tucked in).

Differential Selectivity to Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Decoding A Sites (IC50 = 57 mm) and gentamicin (IC50 = 62 mm; Table 1). In addition, while paromomycin and gentamicin induced strong suppression of a premature UGA C stop codon mutation (49 % at concentrations of 40 and 30 mg mL¿1, respectively),[9] apramycin did not show significant suppression activity (< 1 % at 80 mg mL¿1) even at concentrations twice as much as that of paromomycin and/or gentamicin under the same experimental conditions (see the Experimental Section). A distinct mechanism for the apramycin-induced protein-translation inhibition in prokaryotes was previously demonstrated: while the 4,5and 4,6-disubstituted 2-DOS aminoglycosides (including paromomycin and gentamicin) induce miscoding, the primary effect of apramycin is the inhibition of elongation by blocking ribosome translocation.[18] Furthermore, in the absence of the crystal structure of an eukaryotic ribosome, a recent modeling study of the apramycin≠human A site complex onto a 30S ribosome complexed with mRNA and tRNA suggested that the unique nondecoding "off" state binding of apramycin might cause similar blocking of 40S ribosome translocation and as such, inhibit the elongation step in eukaryotes.[10] Our observation that apramycin strongly inhibits protein translation in eukaryotic systems but lacks readthrough activity, supports this mechanism of action of apramycin in eukaryotes. Three dimensional structure of NB33 complexed to the H. sapiens 18S cytoplasmic A site RNA construct Because both apramycin and NB33 lack readthrough activity and preferentially bind to the eukaryotic A site RNA, along with both being unique 4-substituted 2-DOS aminoglycosides, as opposed to 4,5- and 4,6-disubstituted compounds, an important question that emerged was whether they also function with a similar mechanism on the eukaryotic ribosome. To answer this question, we have determined the 3D structure of NB33 complexed to the H. sapiens 18S cytoplasmic A site RNA construct by X-ray crystallography at 2.8  resolution (Figure 3 A). This construct was specially designed to fold as a duplex with two A sites.[11] Similar rRNA A site constructs have been used before for crystallographic studies to decipher molecular recognition of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic rRNAs by aminoglycosides,[10, 11, 19≠21] and such constructs were proved to represent the same footprint as that of the full 16S rRNA for prokaryotes.[22] The overall crystal structure of the RNA fragment with bound NB33 is shown in Figure 3 B. The two A sites of this structure represent two different conformational states, the "on" (A1492/A1493 bulging out and A1491 tucked in) and "off" (A1491/A1493 bulging out and A1492 tucked in) states, which are similar to the parallel structure of the ligand-free crystal that was reported previously.[11] Surprisingly, however, only one NB33 molecule selectively binds to the deep/major groove of the "off" state, while the "on" state is free of the ligand binding. Note that in the previously reported apramycin≠RNA complex, each of the two A sites were in the "off" state conformation and each were accommodated by apramycin.[10] Therefore, the current NB33≠RNA structure represents the first unique ACHTUNGREexample of the aminoglycoside≠RNA interaction, that demonChemBioChem 2007, 8, 1700 ≠ 1709

As seen from the stereoview of the nondecoding "off" state (Figure 4 A and B), the bound NB33 makes 12 direct contacts with the RNA interior. Ring IIa (2-DOS) is inserted into the deep/major groove and stacks onto the A1492 residue (Figure 4 A and G).[23] Ring IIa also forms a pseudobifurcated pair with the G1408 residue through two H-bonds, C2¿H∑∑∑O6 and N1¿H∑∑∑O6 (Figure 4 F), and interacts with C1407=G1494 and the phosphate-ribose backbone of the A1492 and A1493 residues (Figure 4 B and E≠G). Ring Ia is wedged between two phosphate-ribose backbones and makes four direct contacts with the phosphate-ribose oxygen atoms of G1405 and A1491 (Figure 4 A and B), while the O6' interacts with the N7 atom of the G1405 (Figure 4 B and C). Ring Ib projects out into the solvent region and does not make any interaction with the A site, though its conformation is fixed (Figure 4 A and B). The terminal ring IIb is disordered in the solvent region, with very poor density (Figure 4 B). The G1408 residue, which is universally conserved in all eukaryotic cytoplasmic A sites, makes interactions with the phosphate oxygen atoms of the A1493 residue through two H-bonds, N1¿H∑∑∑O2P (3.0 ) and N2¿H∑∑∑O1P (2.5 ; Figure 4 F). As a consequence, A1493 is fully bulging out and makes crystal packing contact with the "on" state of the A site in a neighboring RNA duplex. The A1492 residue stays inside the A site helix by forming a cis sugar-edge/Watson≠ Crick base pair with C1409 through three direct H-bonds, O2'¿ H∑∑∑O2 (2.9 ), O2'¿H∑∑∑N3 (3.0 ) and N3∑∑∑H¿N4 (3.1 ; Figure 4 G). The A1492 residue also interacts with the phosphate backbone of A1491 by using the Hoogsteen edge with only one H-bond N6¿H∑∑∑O1P (2.7 ; Figure 4 G). The A1491 residue does not have a partner with which to form a base pair in the

Note that, unlike in the "off" state discussed above, in the ligand-free "on" state conformation, the two adenine residues, A1492 and A1493 are fully bulged out from the A site helix and make a unique A-A-A stacked column with the bulged-out A1493 residue from the "off" state of a neighboring A site (Figure 5). In the previously reported ligandfree crystal,[11] these two bulged-out adenines (A1492 and A1493) make minor interactions with base pairs in a neighboring duplex. The crystal structure of NB33-decoding-site complex reveals the molecular basis for the unique eukaryotic target selectivity

increase of this synthetic aminoglycoside. A specific sugar≠ base pair interaction of the 2-DOS ring (ring IIa) with G1408 and its stacking interaction on the A1492,[23] are key determinants in the NB33≠eukaryotic RNA complex that cannot form in a NB33≠prokaryotic RNA A site complex. In the E. coli decoding site, the A1408 and G1491 substitutions (Figure 6) would disrupt such specific interactions of NB33. Indeed, superimposition of NB33 on paromomycin bound to the prokaryotic A site with conserved rings I and II of these two aminoglycosides (Figure 7 A) clearly shows that rings Ib and IIb of NB33 experience steric hindrance from G1491 in the "on" state; this explains why NB33 exhibits the weakest prokaryotic translation

Differential Selectivity to Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Decoding A Sites on eukaryotic ribosome, they differ with respect to their selectivity of action; only NB33 exhibits a selectivity for eukaryotic versus prokaryotic ribosomes. What then determines the selectivity of NB33? The foremost structural similarity between NB33 and apramycin is that both are 4-monosubstitued 2-DOS aminoglycosides. Except for this, they differ by their overall structures and flexibility (apramycin is exceptionally rigid due to its central bicyclic ring I, while NB33 is particularly flexible because of the methylene spacer between the two paromamine moieties), and the number of amino groups (six in NB33 and five in apramycin, Scheme 1). While the target "promiscuity" of aminoglycosides has been largely attributed to their highly charged nature, which is responsible for their electrostatically driven RNA binding,[24] it is unlikely that the one charge difference from apramycin is the main determinant Figure 5. The cytoplasmic A site in the "on" state observed in the crystal of complex between the cytoplasmic for NB33 selectivity. Indeed, as is A site and NB33.

At the crystal packing interface, bulged-out A1493 from the "off" state of the A site clearly seen from Figure 3 B, only [A1493-off (cyan)] is partly inserted into the A site helix of the "on" state and makes an A-A-A stacked column half of the NB33 molecule (rings with bulged-out A1492 (blue) and A1493 (red).

In the apramycin≠RNA "off" state complex, however, all three rings (ring I≠III) are tightly associated with the A site pocket.[10, 25] In addition, the superimposition of these two "off" state structures (Figure 7 B) illustrates the fact that, while both NB33 and apramycin selectively recognize the cytoplasmic "off" state (RMSD = 1.4 ), they use different interaction modes: 1) ring IIa (NB33) and ring I (apramycin) for the sugar≠base pair interactions with the G1408 residue; 2) a stacking interaction with ring IIa (NB33) and an H-bond interaction with ring III (apramycin) for forcing A1492 to be inside the A site; 3) 2-DOS ring of apramycin (ring II) is oriented flat to Figure 6.

Conclusions
In summary, by using a comparative protein translation inhibition study of a series of different 4-, 4,5- and 4,6-substituted 2DOS aminoglycosides in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, we have demonstrated that NB33 is the strongest inhibitor (about 12- to 26-fold stronger) of eukaryotic protein translation and the weakest inhibitor (about 21- to 39-fold weaker) of prokaryotic protein translation of all the aminoglycosides that were tested. NB33 was also found to bind to the eukaryotic (human cytoplasmic) decodingFigure 7.

Differential Selectivity to Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Decoding A Sites because the presence of this unique unbranched pattern of the 2-DOS moiety in both NB33 and apramycin causes deleterious effects on the eukaryotic ribosome, the data presented here suggest that it is important to avoid the presence of such an unbranched pattern of the 2-DOS moiety in these ligands when designing novel synthetic ligands either for the bacterial target or as readthrough inducers. Finally, the lack of absolute prokaryotic selectivity of natural antibiotics is widespread, and is a significant clinical problem. The use of this disadvantage of aminoglycosides for the possible treatment of human genetic diseases is extremely challenging. In the past, our and other laboratories have employed structural information from decoding-site complexes of aminoglycosides to design novel synthetic derivatives of aminoglycosides for their improved antibacterial performance,[20, 31] as well as for their improved readthrough activity.[9, 32] The combined biochemical and structural data presented here demonstrate general molecular principles that determine the decreased selectivity of the natural aminoglycoside apramycin for the prokaryotic decoding site and the increased selectivity of the synthetic aminoglycoside NB33 for the eukaryotic decoding site. These results are therefore extremely beneficial for further research on both the design of new aminoglycoside-based antibiotics with diminished deleterious effects on humans and the design of new aminoglycoside-based structures that selectively target the eukaryotic ribosome.

Experimental Section
Crystallographic study: The RNA oligomer 5'-UUGCGUCGCUCCGGAAAAGUCGC-3' was synthesized by Dharmacon (Boulder, CO, USA) and was purified by HPLC and reversed-phase chromatography. Before crystallization, an aminoglycoside NB33 solution (4 mm) that contained sodium cacodylate (50 mm, pH 6.5) was prepared, and a RNA solution (1 mm) that contained sodium cacodylate (50 mm, pH 6.5) and sodium chloride (12.5 mm) was prepared. Both solutions were annealed by heating at 85 8C for 2 min, followed by slow cooling to 37 8C. Equal volumes of RNA solution and aminoglycoside solution were mixed at 37 8C and then slowly cooled to room temperature (21≠25 8C). Crystallizations were performed by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 8C by mixing the RNA/Aminoglycoside solutions (1 mL) and the crystallization solution (1 mL) that contained sodium cacodylate (50 mm, pH 6.5), hexammine cobalt chloride (0≠10 mm), spermine tetrahydrochloride (0≠2 mm), potassium chloride (100≠200 mm) and 2methyl-2,4-pentanediol condition (1≠2 % (v/v)). Crystals that were suitable for X-ray experiments were obtained after optimization of crystallization conditions. X-ray data were collected at 100 K with synchrotron radiation at the ID29 beamline in the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF; Grenoble, France). Images were processed with the program Crystalclear (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, Texas), and the intensity data were scaled and merged by using SCALA from the CCP4 suite of crystallographic programs.[34] The crystal had a P21 spacegroup with unit cell dimensions of a = 28.6 , b = 41.2 , c = 56.9  and b = 104.38. The statistics of data collection and the crystal data are summarized in Table 2. Initial phases were determined by the Molecular Replacement method with the program AMoRe[35] by using the bulk-solvent technique.[36, 37] The atomic parameters were reChemBioChem 2007, 8, 1700 ≠ 1709

The statistics of structure refinement are summarized in Table 2. Biochemical assays: The commercial aminoglycosides tested (apramycin, paromomycin and gentamicin) were all obtained from Sigma. The aminoglycoside derivatives NB33 and NB30 were synthesized as described previously.[9] Prokaryotic in vitro translation inhibition by the different aminoglycosides was quantified in coupled transcription/translation assays by use of E. coli S30 extract for circular DNA with the pBESTluc plasmid (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Translation reactions (25 mL) that contained variable concentrations of the tested aminoglycoside were incubated at 37 8C for 60 min, cooled on ice for 5 min, and diluted with a dilution reagent (tris-phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.8), DTT (2 mm), 1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetate (2 mm), glycerol (10 %), Triton X-100 (1 %) and BSA (1 mg mL¿1)) into 96-well plates. Eukaryotic in vitro translation inhibition was quantified by using TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System with a luciferase T7 control DNA plasmid (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Translation reactions (25 mL) that contained variable concentrations of the tested aminoglycoside were incubated at 30 8C for 60 min, cooled on ice for 5 min, diluted with the dilution reagent and transferred into 96-well plates. In both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems the luminescence was measured

immediately after the addition of the Luciferase Assay Reagent (50 mL; Promega), and the light emission was recorded with a Victor3TM Plate Reader (Perkin≠Elmer). The concentration of half-maximal inhibition (IC50) was obtained from fitting concentration≠response curves to the data of at least two independent experiments by using Grafit 5 software.[33] The level of in vitro suppression (stop-codon readthrough activity) of apramycin was determined by using a reporter construct that carried an R3X nonsense mutation (a premature UGA C stop codon) of the PCDH15 gene, which is involved in type 1 Usher syndrome.[39] The experimental details for these experiments were identical to our recently reported procedure for the in vitro suppression tests of NB33 and of other aminoglycosides variants.[9] Determination of drug≠RNA association constants: All of the RNA oligomers that were used for the determination of the drug≠ RNA association constants (Ka) were obtained in their PAGE-purified sodium salt forms from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO, USA). The sequences of the human and prokaryotic A site hairpin oligonucleotides that were used in this study were identical to those used in ref. [13]. The Ka values were determined by analyzing drug-induced changes in the fluorescence intensities of RNA molecules in which the adenine at position 1492 had been substituted with the fluorescent purine analogue 2-aminopurine (2AP). For the interaction of NB30 with the human RNA A site, the magnitude of the drug-induced change in the RNA fluorescence intensity was not sufficient to allow rigorous quantification of binding affinity. We therefore used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to generate the required affinity information for this interaction. The experimental details for the determination of Ka values, either by fluorescence or by ITC, were identical to our previously reported procedures.[13, 14] In these earlier studies we have also demonstrated that the Ka values derived from the fluorescence titrations are in good agreement with the corresponding values that were derived from ITC experiments that were conducted under identical solution conditions. All the Ka values were determined at 25 8C in buffer that contained EPPS (10 mm, pH 7.5), EDTA (0.1 mm), and sufficient NaCl to bring the total Na + concentration to 100 mm. Data bank accession codes: The atomic coordinates for the NB33 that was complexed to the H. sapiens 18S cytoplasmic A site RNA construct have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the ID code 2O3V.

Differential Selectivity to Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Decoding A Sites

From this comparative analysis one could argue that probably paromamine alone and/or paromamine linked at the 3'-OH position with an additional sugar ring could also lead to similar selective association into the eukaryotic "off" state conformation and subsequently strongly inhibit eukaryotic translation. Our recent data show however that neither paromamine nor b-linked-paromamine with ribose or 5-amino ribose at 3'-position are effective inhibitors of eukaryotic protein translation in vitro, even though they lack antibacterial activity.[9] These data suggest that only two rings of paromamine (or three rings pattern as above), even though they might participate in key interactions for target binding, are not sufficient for proper recognition/binding and for subsequent biological effect in eukaryotes. Similar lack of antibacterial activity of neamine, albeit its same binding mode to those of several 4,5and 4,6-aminoglycosides to prokaryotic A site "on" state conformation[19] supports this suggestion.
