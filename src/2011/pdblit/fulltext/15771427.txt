The screening of known HIV-1 protease inhibitors against a panel of multi-drug-resistant viruses revealed the potent activity of TMC126 on drug-resistant mutants. In comparison to amprenavir, the improved affinity of TMC126 is largely the result of one extra hydrogen bond to the backbone of the protein in the P2 pocket. Modification of the substitution pattern on the phenylsulfonamide P2 substituent of TMC126 created an interesting SAR, with the close analogue TMC114 being found to have a similar antiviral activity against the mutant and the wild-type viruses. X-ray and thermodynamic studies on both wild-type and mutant enzymes showed an extremely high enthalpy driven affinity of TMC114 for HIV-1 protease. In vitro selection of mutants resistant to TMC114 starting from wild-type virus proved to be extremely difficult; this was not the case for other close analogues. Therefore, the extra H-bond to the backbone in the P2 pocket cannot be the only explanation for the interesting antiviral profile of TMC114. Absorption studies in animals indicated that TMC114 has pharmacokinetic properties comparable to currently approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors.
Introduction The introduction of innovative therapeutic treatments and regimens often changes the impact of disease. For example, with the introduction of HAART1,2 (Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy) AIDS changed, for many patients in the developed world, from a fatal infection into a chronic infectious disease.3 Following the success of HAART, the key new attributes needed for novel drugs against HIV were those for chronic diseases: safety, tolerability, and ease of administration.4 However, another unmet medical need has become apparent: resistance and cross-resistance against all available drugs and combinations thereof. Eventually under drug pressure, a virus is selected that harbors a combination of mutations which results in the synthesis of functional viral enzymes with reduced sensitivity to the drugs composing the regimen. A few years ago we initiated the search for HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) with activity against a broad range of drug-resistant strains. Two evaluation criteria were put forward: (1) high potency on both wild-type and a panel of multi-PI-resistant HIV-1 strains, and (2) favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties after oral administration in at least one species. As the complexity of the resistance patterns was already very high, we decided prior to designing new compounds to first profile existing PIs against highly resistant viruses.

tionale behind this was the observation that most teams had been optimizing for wild-type (WT) potency only, and therefore might have discounted compounds with average potency against wild-type which had good potency against resistant strains. A panel of recombinant HIV strains derived from clinical isolates that were highly resistant and cross-resistant to the PIs marketed at that time was selected. The PI-resistance associated mutations5 present in the selected HIV strains (M1M5) are shown in Table 1. When comparing compounds for broad-spectrum activity, different methods can be used. A comprehensive method is illustrated in Figure 1. A 2D representation of the data is given: the X-axis represents the activity in the cellular antiviral assay on HIV-WT; on the Y-axis the average pEC50 on the panel of PI-resistant strains is given.

close to the bisector; a very potent broad spectrum compound will appear in the right upper corner. The further a compound is found below the bisector, the larger the loss in affinity due to the mutations present in the selected panel. Compounds present above the bisector would show hypersensitivity. For the marketed PIs (atazanavir was not assessed), an average difference of >1 log between activity against WT and against the panel of resistant strains is observed. Therefore, most of the compounds are found below the thin line in Figure 1 that represents a 10-fold decreased activity on the mutants with respect to the wild-type virus. During this search, compound 1b (TMC126) was tested. Earlier in 1998 the group of Ghosh6,7 described the compound as a potent, more drug-like inhibitor of HIV-WT. The compound is closely related to amprenavir (APV, 2), with the tetrahydrofuran (THF) group of 2 replaced by a fused bicyclic tetrahydrofuran moiety and the 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide by a 4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide in the P2-pocket. The structures of 1b and 2 are shown in Figure 2. In the selected panel (Table 1) compound 1b was more active (1.5-2 log) against WT and PI-resistant mutants than the reference drugs, as shown in Figure 1. The compound inhibited all mutants at concentrations lower than the WT EC50s of the currently approved compounds. However, on average the mutants were still 10-fold less sensitive to compound 1b than the wild-type, a shift comparable to the one observed with 2 and lopinavir (LPV). Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of 1b were found to be insufficient to advance this compound into further development. To improve the pharmacokinetic profile while keeping the high potency, a new series of closely related compounds was synthesized and the data are presented here. These compounds all share the bis-THF moiety for improved interaction in the P2-pocket and differ in the benzenesulfonamide substituent or the stereochemistry of the bis-THF group. One of the compounds in this series, TMC1148 (1a), showed prom-

Chemistry The general synthetic route we applied for the synthesis of protease inhibitors 1a-p (Table 2) is outlined in Schemes 1-4. In general, two different approaches were followed. Method A (Scheme 1) starts from 3-dibenzylamino-1-isobutylamino-4-phenylbutan-2-ol (3)9 which

was reacted with substituted phenylsulfonyl chlorides yielding sulfonamides 4a-d. Compound 4i was obtained through demethylation of 4b with BBr3 in CH2Cl2. Debenzylation of these compounds yielded free amino alcohols 8a-d and 8i. It has to be emphasized that in the case of 4a and 4c, debenzylation is accompanied with reduction of the nitro group yielding the corresponding amino derivatives. Then, target compounds 1a-d and 1i were obtained through reaction with carbonic acid 2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl ester hexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan-3-yl ester 11a. The synthesis of this intermediate and some of its stereoisomers is discussed below. The reaction with the 3R,3aS,6aR-enantiomer 11a is preferred, as this results in the optimal conformation for backbone interactions in the P2-pocket of the enzyme. The second method (method B) starts from commercially available (1-oxiranyl-2-phenylethyl)carbamic

acid tert-butyl ester 5 (Scheme 2), which was reacted with isobutylamine thereby forming the amino alcohol 6.10 Similar as in method A, reaction with another set of substituted sulfonyl chlorides yielded sulfonylamides 7j, 7l-p which were deprotected to give amino alcohols 8j, 8l-p which were finally transformed into target compounds 1j, 1l-p. In addition to the compounds described above, some target compounds were obtained by standard functional group transformations. For instance, compound 1k was obtained by reduction of the nitril group of 1j. Furthermore, with the possible benefits of prodrugs in mind, the Ca2+-phosphate salt of 1a was also prepared (1h). While Methods A and B can be regarded as the two general approaches for the synthesis of all protease inhibitors, some comment is needed regarding the synthesis of analogues of TMC114 (1a) with different stereochemistry in the bis-THF moiety.11 As will be

illustrated below, the exact stereochemistry of this element of the molecule is of paramount importance for the resulting biological activity. The synthesis and rationale behind the design of this bis-THF moiety was already reported by Ghosh et al.12 in 1994. Initially a synthetic strategy starting from optically pure diethyl malates was reported which was later replaced by a cobaloxime-mediated radical cyclization methodology yielding rac-9.13 In addition, the enzymatic resolution of this racemate using immobilized Lipase 30 was reported also, which resulted in "bisTHF"-alcohol 9a and acetylated derivative 10. Scheme 3 illustrates this pioneering work which was further extended by us using Mitsunobu chemistry. This resulted in the synthesis of stereoisomers 9a and 9e-g, which were all transformed into the corresponding enantiomerically pure carbonic acid 2,5-dioxo-pyrrolidin1-yl ester hexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan-3-yl esters 11a and 11e-g by reaction with N,N-disuccinimidyl carbonate.14 With these enantiomeric pure compounds in hand, we were able to complete the synthesis of 1a-stereoisomers 1e, 1f, and 1g by reaction of 4-amino-N-(3-amino-2hydroxy-4-phenylbutyl)-N-isobutylbenzenesulfonamide (8a) with the activated carbonates 11a and 11e-g (Scheme 4).

Results and Discussion Structure-Activity Relationships. In the search for new potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors, one of the most important criteria for the next-generation compounds is an improved activity against a broad range of drug-resistant HIV strains. As shown in Figure 1, the PIs currently on the market cannot be considered as having a broad spectrum because their average activity against a panel of resistant mutants is more than 1 log lower than their wild-type activity. For the bis-THF compounds listed in Table 2, a similar plot was constructed (Figure 3). When compared to Figure 1, all compounds in Figure 3 show an improved activity against both wild-type and mutant virus strains. As a reference the best marketed compound from Figure 1, LPV, has also been included in Figure 3. This compound showed an activity similar to the weakest member of the bis-THF family. The antiviral activity of the bisTHF compounds on each of the selected mutant strains is presented in Table 3. From these data it can be seen that the average activity as presented in Table 3 and Figure 3 is in most cases the result of a larger decrease in activity for M1 and M2 and a smaller effect for mutants M3-M5. For some compounds, e.g. 1a and 1k, the largest decrease in pEC50 value observed, 0.25 and

0.35, respectively, is even smaller than the difference of 0.5 log that is considered to be significant in these assays. For the averaged values presented on the Y-axis, the significance level drops down to 0.25 log. A detailed SAR of different substituents introduced on the P2-phenyl group can be derived starting from the unsubstituted phenyl compound (1p), presented as a black dot in Figure 3. The bis-THF compounds have been grouped according to their activities, both on WT and on the small panel of mutants, and all compounds within one group are presented in Figure 3 using the same color-code. Introduction of a p-CN (1j), p-CH3 (1o), or m-NH2 (1c) substituent (shown in pink in Figure 3) hardly influences the antiviral characteristics of the compounds on both the wild-type and the mutant viruses. Introduction of a p-nitro (1l), p-acetyl (1n), and especially a p-iodo (1m) substituent (all electron-

withdrawing substituents, shown as blue markers) does not influence the potency on the WT-virus but significantly increases the activity on the mutant viruses. For the p-OCH3 (1b) and the 3,4-dioxolane (1d) derivatives (small electron-donating and H-bond-accepting groups), the activity on the mutants is even higher than for the previous group. In addition, these compounds also show a higher activity on the WT virus when compared to the unsubstituted compound 1p. In fact, these compounds (1b and 1d, shown in green in Figure 3) have the highest activity on wild-type virus of all the compounds presented here (pEC50 > 9). Unfortunately, their activity on the mutants is still about 1 log less than on the wild-type virus. In Figure 3, one group of compounds (shown in red) with wild-type activity comparable to 1p is found very close to the bisector and can therefore be considered as potent broad spectrum inhibitors of the selected panel. This group contains the p-NH2 (1a), p-OH (1i), and p-CH2NH2 (1k) substituents: small, polar, and with both hydrogen bond-donating and -accepting capability. They are the only compounds as active on the WT as on this panel of mutants. An X-ray structure of the complex of HIV-1 protease with the p-NH2 derivative indicates that this substituent forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone CdO of Asp30 and another water-mediated hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp30 in the P2-pocket. Modeling has shown that also the p-OH and p-CH2NH2 substituents can pick up at least one of these interactions. In addition, the backbone NH of Asp30 is also within reach of a hydrogen bond-accepting group substituted on the benzene ring. The N,,,H-N distance in the p-NH2 X-ray structure is 2.53 Å. This interaction with N-H (Asp30) is also present in the compounds with the highest activity on WT enzyme, 1b and 1d, and because of the nature of the substituents in this group, the lone pairs are oriented differently and the interaction tends to be stronger than it is in the case of the red group. This type of interaction seems to be more important for interacting with the WT enzyme, resulting in a shift of approximately 1 log value from the weak interacting (red) to the strong interacting (green) group of compounds. This shift already indicates the importance of the position of the hydrogen acceptor and the orientation of the lone pairs. The position of the O-atom in 1b might also be influenced by the presence of van der Waals interactions of the methyl group with side chains present in the P2-pocket. In the case of mutations of these side chains, the orientation and position of the methyl group might be altered, resulting in a less optimal orientation of the oxygen lone pair toward the NH (Asp30) and a drop in activity. The compounds that are found close to the bisector interact primarily as hydrogen bond donors rather than hydrogen acceptor. They can donate a hydrogen bond to Asp30 in many different ways (by interacting with the backbone or the flexible side chain or both) and are therefore less susceptible to changes in the structure of the enzyme. This explains why these compounds also remain active on the mutants in the selected panel. The importance of the interactions in the P2-pocket at the other side of the active site is obvious when comparing 1a with 2, two compounds that differ only in the functional group present in this pocket.

activity (pEC50) measured on HIV-WT in a AVE-MT4MTT cell-line is 8.39 for 1a, while it is 7.43 for 2. Recently, both compounds have been crystallized with a multi-drug-resistant mutant of the enzyme (L63P, V82T, I84V).15 The crystals for both structures were obtained under similar experimental conditions. The structures crystallized in the space group P212121, with similar cell dimensions and one dimer per asymmetric unit. Data for the 1a structure were collected at -80 °C using a synchrotron source, while data for 2 were collected at room temperature on a rotating anode source. The crystal structure with 1a diffracted to a resolution of 1.35 Å, with an R-factor of 16.8%. For the complex with 2, a resolution of 2.2 Å was obtained. Despite the different ways of data collection, these X-ray structures form an ideal basis for the comparison of compounds 1a and 2. Hydrogen atoms have been added to the structures, and the position of these atoms has been optimized using InsightII. For these all-atom structures, the intermolecular interactions in the P2pocket of the enzyme are tabulated in Table 4. The O-atom of the tetrahydrofuran moiety of 2 forms a strong hydrogen bond to the backbone N-H of Asp30. In the case of 1a, an additional hydrogen bond with the backbone of Asp29 is formed by the second tetrahydrofuran ring in 1a. In addition, this second ring is also in a favorable position for interaction with the side chain of Asp29. The interactions with Asp29 account for a 10fold increase in activity for compound 1a when compared to 2. Similar conclusions were drawn in a recent paper by Tie et al.16 on the X-ray structures of 1a in complex with wild-type and two single mutant HIV-1 proteases. The thermodynamic data derived from isothermal titration calorimetry15 as shown in Table 5 also support these findings. In this experiment the binding thermodynamics of the compounds to the same multi-drugresistant mutant (L63P, V82T, I84V) have been measured. The binding free enthalpy for 1a is 3 kcal/mol larger than for 2, which may be in part due to the additional hydrogen bond interaction. The association constant Ka observed for 1a (1.7 × 1010 M-1) is also in line with the observation by Ohtaka et al.17 on the closely related compound TMC126 (1b) for a double mutant (V82F/I84V).

(SQV), and nelfinavir (NFV) have shown that the binding of these inhibitors to HIV-1 protease is mainly entropy-driven,18 whereas binding of 2 is both enthalpically and entropically driven. In the case of 1a and 1b, the enthalpic contribution seems to be the dominant one as a consequence of the tight interactions between these compounds and the enzyme. This high affinity due to backbone interactions is only one of the reasons why these compounds retain their wild-type potency also against multi-drug-resistant viruses. Another reason is the fact that 1a and 1b, as well as 2, lie predominantly within the so-called substrate envelope. This substrate envelope is defined as the consensus volume, i.e., the region occupied by the natural substrates of the enzyme.19,20 It is known that all first generation inhibitors do not fit well into this envelope. In addition, it has been shown that the primary drug-resistant mutations often occur at positions in the protease that are contacted by inhibitor atoms protruding beyond the volume of the substrate envelope.21 This observation explains why 2, 1a, and 1b have a different pattern of selecting viral mutants and drug resistance compared to first generation inhibitors. It is also interesting to link the activity of the different bis-THF isomers 1a, 1e, 1f, and 1g to their interactions in the P2-pocket. The most important interactions present in this pocket are backbone interactions with the N-H groups of Asp29 and Asp30. In compound 2, containing only one THF ring, only the interaction with Asp30 is present. This compound has a pEC50 ) 7.43 on the wild-type enzyme. In compound 1a, the additional interaction with Asp29 accounts for a 10-fold increase in the activity (pEC50 ) 8.39). Modeling has indicated that compound 1e is also able to interact with both Asp29 and Asp30. This is illustrated in Figure 4. The figure presents a superposition of compounds 1a and 1e in the P2-pocket. Please note that in order to interact with the 2 backbone N-H groups, compound

same for 1a. In Figure 5 a superposition of the two remaining stereoisomers, 1f and 1g, is shown. Both isomers are able to interact with the backbone of Asp30 in a similar way as 2 interacts with the enzyme, although in the case of the 1g model this is a very weak hydrogen bond. As can be seen from Figure 5, the second ring of the bis-THF system in 1f and 1g is found in a sterically unfavorable position, and therefore the activity of stereoisomers 1f and 1g is lower than the activity of 2. In Vitro Selection Experiments. The results presented above suggest different pathways for the development of resistance for some of the described compounds as compared to currently approved PIs. To investigate this, in vitro selection experiments were conducted, where cells infected with WT virus were exposed to increasing concentrations of the inhibitors and the emerging virus populations were characterized genotypically and phenotypically. The results of these experiments are presented in Figure 6. In this figure, both 2 and RTV are included as references. Data have been normalized, i.e., the fold-increase in selecting concentration (rather than the absolute concentration of the inhibitors) is plotted against time. In the lab, within 100 days of in vitro culture in the presence of a suboptimal concentration (3 × EC50) of 2 or RTV, a virus is selected that is 100 times less sensitive to the inhibitor and that carries the same mutations as the ones observed in patients on a failing PI-containing therapy. 1b and 1d behaved in the same way; i.e., within 100 days, a virus carrying known PI-resistance

1e needs to adopt a conformation in which the carbamate group is in a different position than it is in the case of compound 1a. This might be the reason for the observed decrease in the activity against HIV-WT for 1e (pEC50 of 1e ) 7.97). The average activity on the mutants is approximately 0.5 log lower than the HIVWT activity for compound 1e, whereas it is almost the

Figure 6. Results of in vitro selection experiments for compounds 1a, 1b, 1d, 2, and RTV. Cells infected with WT virus were exposed to increasing concentrations of the inhibitors (see Experimental Section). Data have been normalized, i.e., the foldincrease in inhibitor concentration (rather than the absolute concentration of the inhibitors) is plotted against time. This is obtained by the ratio of the inhibitor concentration at time t and the inhibitor concentration at the start of the selection experiments.

and a broad range of PI-resistant HIV strains. Close analogues of the lead compound showed different types of antiviral properties both in terms of spectrum and in vitro selection of resistant viruses. The broad spectrum activity of 1a is due to both the bis-THF ring interacting in the P2-pocket and the primary aniline group on the sulfonamide part present in the P2-pocket. TMC114 was selected for clinical development based on its high potency against both wild-type HIV and PIresistant mutants, together with a very slow emergence of resistant viruses in vitro, and superior pharmacokinetic properties. TMC114 is currently in phase IIB (dose-finding) clinical trials. Experimental Section
Chemistry. General Experimental Procedures. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer, operating at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C and with DMSO as solvent unless otherwise stated. In every case tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal standard. Chemical shifts are given in ppm and J values in Hz. Multiplicity is indicated using the following abbreviations: d for doublet, t for a triplet, m for a multiplet, etc. Low-resolution mass spectra (LRMS) were performed on a single quadrupole (Waters ZMD), ion trap (ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca) or a time-of-flight (Waters LCT) mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive or negative mode. All reagents were purchased from commercial sources (Acros, Aldrich, etc.) and were used as received. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 60 Å, 60-200 µm (ROCC). Thin-layer chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Optical rotations were measured at the sodium D line, using a Propol-automatic polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was done on a Waters Alliance 2690 (pump + auto sampler) system equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array-detector. To check the purity of the end products (1a-p), two independent chromatographic systems were used. First system: column: Waters Xterra MS C18, (3.5 µm, 4.60 mm × 100 mm), mobile phase A: 10 mM CH3COONH4 in H2O, mobile phase B: CH3CN. Analysis were run at 30 °C using a flow rate of 1 mL/min applying the following gradient: 0 min: 5%B, 10 min: 95%B, 12 min: 95%B. In every case, 10 µL of a 1 mM solution was injected. The equilibration time between two runs was 3 min. Second system (polar): column: Alltech Prevail C18 (3.0 µm, 4.6 mm × 100 mm), mobile phase A: 10 mM CH3COONH4 in H2O, mobile phase B: CH3CN. Analysis were run at 30 °C using a flow rate of 1 mL/min applying the following gradient: 0 min: 0%B, 1 min: 0%B, 9 min: 95%B, 12 min: 95%B. In every case, 10 µL of a 1 mM solution was injected. The equilibration time between two runs was 3 min. Eluted peaks were detected at a single wavelength (max) for both systems. The retention time for each compound is given for both systems and is reported in minutes. GC analysis was performed on a HP5890 gas chromatograph equipped with an on column injector using a DB-XLB column (length: 15 m, I.D.: 0.25 mm, film: 0.25 µm). The detection was done with a flame ionization detector operating at a temperature of 370 °C. Volumes of 0.1 µL were injected, the carrier gas used was helium, and runs were performed operating at pressure of 75 kPa. The temperature gradient applied was 30 °C/min. In those cases were GC data are given, retention time is reported in minutes. N-(3-Dibenzylamino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyl)-N-isobutyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonamide (4a). To a stirred solution of 3-dibenzylamino-1-isobutylamino-4-phenylbutan-2-ol (3) (12.5 g, 30.0 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (200 mL) was added Et3N (3.34 g, 33.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) followed by 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (6.98 g, 31.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv). The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4 h after which it was washed twice with 200 mL of H2O. The organic layer was dried on MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The crude product was then recrystallized from 2-propanol, yielding 4a

The value between parentheses represents the standard deviation b Data after oral administration at 20 mg/kg in rat have been generated for 1a and 1h. The values reported are the average of two measurements.

associated mutations and with a 100-fold reduced sensitivity was selected. 1a (TMC114) performed differently; even after 1 year, the sensitivity for 1a is only reduced by a factor of 20, and moreover the mutations appearing are not those observed in patients failing PI therapy.22 The viruses that were isolated in the presence of 1a remained sensitive to most of the current PIs. Pharmacokinetics. The second selection criterion was a set of pharmacokinetic related properties. In Table 6 the metabolic stability is presented in three different species (liver microsomes of rat, dog, and human origin) as % remaining parent compound after 30 min incubation at 37 °C. The degree of metabolism is determined by direct measurement of the residual parent compound in the reaction mixture using LC-MS. 1b and 1d appeared to be extremely labile. 1a had a stability comparable to other protease inhibitors. 2 and IDV have been included as a reference in Table 6. The same trend was observed in oral absorption studies in animals. Data of oral administration to dogs at 80 mg/kg as a PEG400 solution are presented in Table 7. 1a is clearly superior to 1b and 1d both in terms of Cmax and AUC. During this evaluation, for compound 1b only minor levels of possible metabolite 1i were observed. In analogy with fosamprenavir, the monophosphate prodrug of 2, we studied the behavior of compound 1h, the monophosphate ester of 1a. The main advantage of this type of prodrugs are their superior solid-state characteristics, which is outside the scope of this publication. We only investigated the potential for higher bioavailability. Data of a single oral administration in PEG400 in rats at 20 mg/kg were generated; the parent compound and the monophosphate behave in a similar way. For 2 and its prodrug, similar observations were reported previously.23 Conclusions Screening against a panel of PI-resistant mutant HIV strains allowed us to identify a promising class of protease inhibitors with activity against both wild-type

MT-4 cells are human T-lymphoblastoid cells that are highly sensitive to HIV infection, producing a rapid and strong cytopathic effect. MT4-LTREGFP cells are MT4 cells stably transfected with a vector containing the coding sequence for the Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) under control of HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat (LTR). Upon infection of these cells with HIV, the viral transactivator protein Tat activates the LTR promoter, which in turn triggers the transcription of the EGFP coding sequence. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum and antibiotics in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. HIV strains used for the profiling of the compounds were wild-type HIV-1 strain IIIB and recombinant HIV strains derived from clinical isolates. Those were constructed as previously described24 by cotransfection of MT-4 cells with sample-derived viral protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding sequences and an HIV-1 HXB2-derived proviral clone deleted in the protease and RT coding region. Antiviral Assays. The antiviral activity of compounds against wild-type HIV and clinical sample derived recombinant viruses was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay method as previously described.25 Briefly, various concentra-

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, Vol. 48, No. 6 1821 tions of the test compounds were added to wells of a flat-bottom microtiter plate. Subsequently, virus and MT-4 cells were added to a final concentration of 200-250 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID50)/well and 30 000 cells/well, respectively. After 5 days of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the cytopathic effect (CPE) of the replicating virus was measured by the MTT method. The results of the antiviral assay were expressed as pEC50 () -log EC50), with EC50 defined as the concentration of a compound achieving 50% CPE compared with the drug-free control. Cytotoxicity of the test compound was determined in parallel using mock-infected cell cultures containing an identical compound concentration range but no virus. Genotyping. Genotypic analysis was performed by automated population-based full-sequence analysis (ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing). Sequencing results are reported as amino acid changes compared to the wild-type (HXB2) reference sequence.26 In Vitro Selection of Resistant Strains. MT-4-LTREGFP cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 to 0.001 CCID50/cell in the presence of the inhibitor compound at a starting concentration two to three times the EC50. The cultures were subcultivated and scored microscopically on virus-induced fluorescence and cytopathic effect every 3 to 4 days. Cultures were subcultivated in the presence of the same concentration of compound until full virus breakthrough, and subsequently at a higher compound concentration to select for variants able to grow in the presence of the highest possible inhibitor concentration. X-ray Crystallography. A multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 protease with substitutions L63P, V82T, and I84V was crystallized in complex with 1a and 2. Both structures crystallized in the space group P212121 with one dimer per asymmetric unit. Data on the 1a complex were collected under cryocooled conditions using the synchrotron source at Advanced Light Source at Lawrence-Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA. The crystal complex with 1a diffracted to a resolution of 1.35 Å, with an R-factor of 16.8%. Data for the complex with 2 were collected at room temperature on an R-axis IV image plate system mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode source. The resolution obtained for the complex with 2 is 2.2 Å. The details of the X-ray crystallography experiments and the refinement statistics have been published elsewhere.15 The X-ray structures have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank (PDBcodes 1T7I and 1T7J). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. Thermodynamic parameters of inhibitor binding were determined using an isothermal titration calorimeter, VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The buffer used for all protease and inhibitor solutions consisted of 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 2% DMSO, and 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). The binding affinities of 2 and 1a for the multi-drug-resistant protease were obtained by the displacement titration method, using acetyl-pepstatin and indinavir, respectively, as the weaker binder.17,27,28 Direct titration experiments were also performed with the tightly binding inhibitor to confirm the enthalpy changes obtained by the displacement method. Each experiment was performed at least twice. The details of the ITC experiments have been published elsewhere.15 Modeling. The structures obtained after X-ray crystallography have some missing and disordered side chains and do not contain information on the position of the hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the structures were first completed using the Biopolymer module in InsightII (Accelrys Inc). This was followed by an optimization of the hydrogen atoms using the conjugate gradient approach. The CVFF force field29 was used in the Discover module of InsightII to perform these optimizations. The refinement was finished when the largest derivative was smaller than 0.01. For the comparison of the stereoisomers of 1a, the stereochemistry of the bis-THF moiety in the X-ray structure of 1a was adapted in order to obtain the correct stereochemistry of compounds 1e, 1f, and 1g. Subsequently, the geometry of the active site was optimized for all four stereoisomers. The active

1822 Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, Vol. 48, No. 6 site was defined as the region of the complex containing the compound and the amino acids having at least one atom closer than 6 Å to any atom of the compound. The optimization was performed using the CVFF force-field29 in Discover (InsightII) using the conjugate gradient approach until the largest derivative was smaller than 0.01. After the refinement, the resulting structures were superimposed, and the superposition of the bis-THF parts of the closest analogues is presented in Figures 4 and 5. These figures have been generated using DS ViewerPro 5.0 (Accelrys Inc).
