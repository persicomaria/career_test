Platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb)-binding proteins (GPIb-BPs) from snake venoms are usually C-type lectins, which target specific sites of GPIb and elicit distinct effects on platelets. In the present paper, we report a tetrameric platelet-agglutinating factor (molecular mass 121.1 kDa), termed mucrocetin, purified from the venom of Taiwan habu (Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus). Mucrocetin is a GPIb agonist with a binding site distinct from that of flavocetin-A (a snake venom GPIb antagonist) on GPIb, in spite of the high sequence identity (94.6 %) between the two venom lectins. The crystal structure of mucrocetin was solved and refined to 2.8 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm) resolution, which shows an interesting crystal packing of six-layer cylinders of doughnut-shaped molecules. The four  heterodimers are arranged in an unusual square-shaped ring stabilized by four interdimer `head-to-tail'

disulphide bridges. Detailed structural comparison between mucrocetin and flavocetin-A suggests that their disparate platelet effects are probably attributable to different charge distributions on the putative concave binding surface. A unique positively charged patch on the binding surface of mucrocetin, formed by Lys102 , Lys108 , Lys109 and Arg123 in the -subunit coupled with Lys22 , Lys102 , Lys116 and Arg117 in the -subunit, appears to be the primary determinant of its platelet-agglutinating activity. Conceivably, this interesting venom factor may provide a useful tool to study platelet agglutination by binding to the GPIb­IX­V complex. Key words: flavocetin-A, lectin-like protein, mucrocetin, platelet glycoprotein Ib, snake venom, Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of von Willebrand factor (vWf ) A1 domain with the platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) is important in mediating the initial tethering and rolling of platelets on the subendothelium of injured vessel walls [1,2]. Several exogenous modulators, such as ristocetin and some venom proteins [3­5], were shown to promote the formation of vWf­GPIb complex through the binding to the A1 (or A3) domain of vWf. In addition, a number of GPIb-binding proteins (GPIb-BPs) were found in the venoms of many crotalid and viperid snakes [6,7], which either play the role of GPIb antagonist to block the binding of vWf to GPIb or behave as GPIb agonists to induce platelet aggregation or agglutination. Up to now, several venom GPIb antagonists and their fulllength sequences have been reported (summarized in Table 1) [8­13]. These venom proteins, with the exception of flavocetin-A (FL-A), exist as  heterodimers of approx. 27 kDa, with the two subunits being approx. 14 kDa and 15 kDa. In contrast, FL-A is a tetrameric form of  heterodimers linked by four interdimer cysteine bridges [14]. These venom factors block ristocetin- or botrocetin-induced aggregation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), but they had no effect on ADP-induced aggregation. On the other hand, alboaggregin A and B and agglucetin are venom GPIb agonists (Table 1), capable of directly inducing aggregation or agglutination of washed or fixed human platelets [15,16]. Alboaggregin A and agglucetin were reported to exist in highmolecular-mass forms of approx. 50 kDa, composed of disulphide-linked , ,  and  (or 1, 2, 1 and 2 in agglucetin) subunits, whereas alboaggregin B is an  heterodimer. The

tetrameric alboaggregin A is stronger in terms of inducing platelet aggregation and subsequent release reaction than alboaggregin B [15]. Although these GPIb-BPs are structurally similar and target on the same platelet receptor, they appeared to bind to distinct or partially overlapping sites on GPIb [10]. Crystal structures of the similar lectin-like venom proteins showed that the  and  subunits are dimerized by domain swapping, creating a central concave surface, which could be important as a binding site for the target molecules [14,17]. The projected loop and the adjoining subunit complete the C-type carbohydraterecognition domain (CRD) fold. However, they generate a large conformational change on the hinge region classically involved in Ca2+ - and carbohydrate-binding, resulting in the disruption of the lectin active site and the loss of carbohydrate-recognizing activity. The work of Mizuno et al. [18] on the elucidation of the complex structure between Factor X-binding protein and the  -carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of Factor X demonstrated that the concave surface is indeed the binding site for the Gla domain [18]. Close structural comparisons suggested that the determinants of lectin-like venom proteins for target recognition may reside on this concave surface, which has different surface charge potentials among various venom proteins [19]. In the present paper, the crystal structure and biological activity of a platelet-agglutinating factor, mucrocetin, purified from the venom of Taiwan habu (Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus) are reported. We found that mucrocetin shows a highly similar threedimensional structure and a high sequence identity with that of FL-A. Surprisingly, further analysis of platelet-agglutinating activity suggested that mucrocetin is a GPIb agonist with a binding site distinct from that of FL-A on GPIb. Since the binding sites of

MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents

The crude venoms of T. mucrosquamatus were obtained from a local snake farm, and the venom glands were kindly provided by the National Institute of Preventive Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan. Freeze-dried venom of Trimeresurus flavoviridis was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). TSK DEAE650 anion-exchange resin was obtained from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Sephadex G-100 and Q Sepharose resins, the QuickPrepTM mRNA preparation kit, and the cDNA Synthesis System Plus Kit were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) CD42b Ab-1 (raised against the platelet GPIb) was purchased from Lab Vision Co. (Fremont, CA, U.S.A.). Ristocetin was obtained from ChronoLog Co. (Havertown, PA, U.S.A.). All other reagents were purchased from either Sigma or Merck.
Isolation and purification of mucrocetin and FL-A

Human peripheral blood collected from a healthy volunteer was anticoagulated with 0.1 vol. of sodium citrate (3.8 %, w/v). In order to prepare human PRP, the whole blood was centrifuged at 150 g for 12 min at room temperature (25  C). Washed platelet suspension was prepared mainly according to the protocol described previously [22]. Isolated platelets were suspended in Tyrode's solution [0.1 % (w/v) glucose, 0.8 % (w/v) sodium chloride, 0.1 % (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 0.02 % (w/v) potassium chloride, 0.005 % (w/v) sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.02 % (w/v) calcium chloride and 0.01 % (w/v) magnesium chloride, pH 7.4] and the platelet count was adjusted to 3­5 × 108 platelets/ml. Platelet agglutination was performed using an aggregometer (Chrono-Log) at 37  C with stirring (1000 rev./min). The extent of platelet agglutination was monitored continuously for 10 min by turbidimetry and expressed as an increase in light transmission.
Reduction, pyridylethylation and N-terminal sequence analysis of mucrocetin

Venom components were separated by anion-exchange chromatography on an open column (2.5 cm × 46 cm) packed with TSK DEAE-650 (M) gel suspension. Approx. 350 mg of venom powder was dissolved in 8 ml of starting buffer (0.025 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.7) and applied to the column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was extensively washed with starting buffer and was then eluted in a linear gradient of 0.025­0.5 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.7, followed by 0.5­ 1.0 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, similar to the method described previously [20]. A gel-filtration chromatographic step was carried out on a Sephadex G-100 (S) (1.6 cm × 120 cm) column, using 0.025 M ammonium bicarbonate at pH 7.8 as the elution buffer. Finally, a HPLC gel-filtration column (Bio-Sil SEC 250-5, 7.8 mm × 300 mm, Bio-Rad) on a Hitachi liquid chromatograph equipped with a model L-6200 pump and a tunable UV detector was used to purify further the fractions isolated from the above chromatographic steps. We also purified FL-A according to the method reported by Taniuchi et al. [21] with some modifications. The purified proteins

Mucrocetin (approx. 2 nmol) was incubated in 100 µl of 0.25 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mM EDTA and 5 % (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol for 16 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 5 µl of 4-vinylpyridine was added and the incubation was continued for an additional 90 min. After acidification with pure formic acid, S-pyridylethylated subunits were separated and purified by RP-HPLC using a Vydac Protein C4 column (1 cm × 25 cm). The eluted mucrocetin subunits were freeze-dried and dissolved in 0.1 % (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, before N-terminal sequence analysis.
Cloning of mucrocetin cDNA

To prepare the cDNA mixture for PCR cloning, two deepfrozen venom glands from an individual snake were homogenized and polyadenylated RNAs were purified using the QuickPrepTM mRNA preparation kit. Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was carried out using the cDNA Synthesis System Plus Kit. For the cloning of mucrocetin cDNA, two oligonucleotide primers of sense and antisense orientations based on the highly conserved

The reactions were subjected to 35 cycles of heat denaturation at 94  C for 1.5 min, annealing the primers to the DNAs at 50  C for 2 min, and DNA chain extension at 72  C for 2.5 min, followed by a final extension at 72  C for 10 min. The PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T vector, and then transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109. Plasmids purified from positive clones were prepared for nucleotide sequence analysis by automatic fluorescence-based sequencing using a model 373A DNA Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.).

adjustments of the protein model and addition of water molecules. Finally, further refinement by employing NCS restraints and using the synchrotron data from National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center was carried out. The final model of mucrocetin contains 601 water molecules located according to a density level of 1.2  in the 2F o -F c maps.
RESULTS Isolation and purification of mucrocetin and FL-A

Purified mucrocetin was concentrated to 52.3 mg/ml using an ultra-filtration membrane YM-30 (Millipore Amicon, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). The screening for the crystals of mucrocetin was achieved using crystallization screening kits from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA, U.S.A.). Finally, mucrocetin in 0.025 M ammonium bicarbonate at pH 7.8 was mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir (2.5 M 1,6-hexanediol and 0.1 M sodium citrate at pH 5.6) and then crystallized at room temperature using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Crystals with their dimensions reaching 0.2 mm × 0.15 mm × 0.1 mm appeared within 1 week. X-ray diffraction data were first collected at Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan) using MSC MicroMax002 equipped with an R-AXIS IV++ image-plate detector. Later, data were collected using beam line 41XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. Finally, more data were collected from beam line 17B2 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan) using a similar image-plate detector as above. Data were processed using the HKL package installed on Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) O2 workstations [23].
Structure determination and refinement

T. mucrosquamatus venoms were separated on a TSK DEAE650 anion-exchange column into at least 12 peaks (Figure 1), showing an elution pattern superior to that reported previously [20]. The fractions with strong platelet-agglutinating activity were collected. As judged by SDS/PAGE, a number of proteins in the pooled fraction showed molecular masses larger than 100 kDa under non-reducing conditions and distinct from the rest. Therefore further purification by Sephadex G-100 was carried out, which was followed by a final step of purification using a HPLC gel-permeation column to obtain pure mucrocetin. On SDS/ PAGE, mucrocetin migrated as two distinct bands of 16 kDa and 14 kDa under reducing conditions, and a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 135 kDa under non-reducing condition (Figure 1, inset, lanes 2 and 4). On the other hand, after purification, FL-A was analysed for the first five amino-acid residues of the two subunits. They are AspPhe-Asp-Xaa-Ile and Gly-Phe-Xaa-Xaa-Pro, in agreement with the - and -chain of FL-A respectively [14]. The purified FL-A was also verified by its strong inhibitory activity on ristocetininduced platelet aggregation in human PRP (Figure 2D). On SDS/PAGE, mucrocetin shows a similar mass to FL-A under non-reducing conditions (Figure 1, inset, lanes 3 and 4), while the -subunit of mucrocetin is slightly larger than that of FL-A under reducing conditions (Figure 1, inset, compare lanes 1 and 2). Rabbit antiserum raised against the -chain of mucrocetin significantly cross-interacted with the -chain of mucrocetin (Figure 1, inset, lane 6), indicating the similar antigenicity between these two subunits of mucrocetin.
Platelet-agglutination studies

For molecular replacement search, a 4.5 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm) resolution data set collected using an in-house X-ray source and a tetrameric FL-A model generated from the PDB (Protein Data Bank) deposition 1C3A were employed. By the comparison of space group and unit cell dimension with those of FL-A, the mucrocetin crystal was estimated to contain three heterodimers in an asymmetric unit. By using the program CNS [24], three rotation function solutions were obtained, as expected, which corresponded to rotations of 62 , 78 and 93 about the 4-fold axis. A translation function search based on the three rotation function solutions also yielded three solutions, with the centres of tetramers remaining aligned with the c-axis and placed at 74.3 Å, 45.9 Å and 14.2 Å from the origin. Preliminary refinement using the FL-A model while including strict non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints gave R and Rfree values of 0.278 and 0.335 respectively, using the 3.3 Å data set collected at SPring-8. The resulting Fourier maps showed corresponding densities for most of the different amino-acid residues between FL-A and mucrocetin. Density modification with solvent flipping and 3-fold NCS averaging increased the overall figure of merit from 0.78 to 0.86, but the quality of the map was not significantly improved. Substitution of all aminoacid residues for the correct sequence of mucrocetin yielded R and Rfree values of 0.282 and 0.312 respectively, after strict-NCS refinement. Subsequent cycles of refinement included manual

Mucrocetin strongly induces platelet agglutination in either human PRP or washed platelet suspensions (Figure 2). It appears that mucrocetin agglutinates platelets in a vWf-independent manner, causing no obvious change of platelet shape. Similar agglutinating activities of mucrocetin in both PRP and washed platelets, with the maximum agglutination achieved at a concentration of approx. 2.5 µg/ml (18.5 nM), were observed (compare Figure 2A with Figure 2F), suggesting that mucrocetin does not modulate vWf as ristocetin and botrocetin do [3,4]. Moreover, mucrocetin pre-treatment had no effect on the aggregation of platelets induced by ristocetin (1.4 mg/ml) in human PRP (Figures 2B and 2C). Purified FL-A at 20 µg/ml, which is much higher than the reported IC50 [21], completely abolished the aggregation induced by ristocetin in human PRP (Figure 2D), but it did not inhibit the mucrocetin-induced agglutinations in both PRP and washed platelets (Figures 2E and 2H). In addition, a mAb CD42b Ab-1, raised against the platelet GPIb, dose-dependently blocked the agglutination induced by mucrocetin with an IC50 of 18.1 µg/ml (Figure 2G).

HPLC column as described in the Materials and methods section. The N-terminal 20- and 26-amino-acid sequences of the two S-pyridylethylated subunits of mucrocetin were determined by Edman degradation. The larger subunit, designated as , has 25 of its N-terminal 26 residues identical with the -chain of FL-A [14], whereas the smaller one, designated as , is the same as the -chain of FL-A in their N-terminal 20 residues. In addition, the N-terminal sequences of mucrocetin  and  subunits are also identical with those of TMVA [25], a platelet-aggregating factor isolated from the venoms of geographically remote T. mucrosquamatus.
cDNA cloning of mucrocetin

The cDNA encoding the mucrocetin -subunit has a nucleotide sequence of 531 bp, which contains the 5 -untranslated primer region of 24 bp, an open reading frame of 474 bp, a stop codon and the 3 -primer-containing region of 30 bp (GenBank® accession number AY390533). In addition, the cDNA for the nucleotide sequence of -subunit is 507 bp, containing the 5 -primer region of 24 bp, an open reading frame of 444 bp, a stop codon and the 3 -primer-containing region of 36 bp (GenBank® accession number AY390534). The deduced amino-acid sequences of the - and -subunits of mucrocetin revealed a signal peptide of 23 amino-acid residues, followed by mature subunits of 135 and 125 residues respectively. The predicted N-terminal sequences of - and -subunits of mucrocetin are consistent with those by Edman degradation. The calculated molecular masses of - and -subunits of mucrocetin are 15 729 Da and 14 542 Da respectively.

Comparison of the deduced sequences of mature  and  subunits of mucrocetin showed 39.2 % identity, whereas the signal peptides of these two subunits are highly similar to each other (95.7 % identity). The sequence of - and -subunits of mucrocetin have 130 out of 135 and 116 out of 125 amino-acid residues identical with those of FL-A respectively (Figure 3). Overall, other GPIb-targeting venom proteins were found to have 46.9­63.5 % sequence identity. The - and -subunits of mucrocetin bear higher structural similarity to the - and  -chains of alboaggregin A (60.7 % and 71.2 % respectively).
Crystal structure determination

In the refined model, deviations from ideal values of bond lengths and angles are within acceptable range. Most (97.3 %) amino-acid residues have their ( , ) angles in the allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot [26]. Asp12 (Asp12 in -subunit) and Asp12 , with ( , ) of about (60, - 110), occur in a special glycine-like type II -turn [27]. Another glycine-like conformation occurs at Ala88 , with ( , ) of (85, - 30), probably caused by two hydrogen bonds. The disulphide bonds between the cysteine residues 4­15, 32­129, 81­77, 104­121, 4­15, 32­121 and 98­113, as well as the interdimer link of 135­3, have good geometry, with bond distances of 2.04 + 0.01 Å between - the sulphur atoms. The final statistics are listed in Table 2. The use of NCS restraints resulted in a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) in co-ordinates of 0.113­0.259 Å for 1042 backbone atoms and 1.025­1.123 Å for 1085 side-chain atoms between the three heterodimers in an asymmetric unit.

disulphide linkages of Cys135 ­Cys3 between neighbouring heterodimers. The ring has a dimension of approx. 122 × 122 × 36 Å3 , delimiting a large central pore of approx. 65 × 65 × 36 Å3 . Both the two () subunits in each heterodimer comprise a globular body and an extending loop. The body is composed of five major -strands and two -helices and the loop contributes to dimerization with another subunit. An interdomain disulphide bond between Cys81 and Cys77 links the swapped loops within each dimer. The swapped loops are associated with the countersubunit through an extensive contact interface, which buries 1770 Å2 and 1890 Å2 of the 8400 Å2 and 8100 Å2 total surface areas of and -subunits and involves 36 and 35 amino-acid residues respectively. Besides the disulphide bond (Cys81 ­Cys77 ), there are at least 25 direct hydrogen bonds and 12 van der Waals contacts between the two subunits. Interestingly, the segments of residues 71­75 and 78­82 formed an intermolecular anti-parallel -like structure. Presumably, this structure and a number of other backbone hydrogen bonds formed in the loop region should contribute to stability of the heterodimer. In contrast, interactions between neighbouring heterodimers in the tetrameric mucrocetin are fewer. The interface buries only 400 Å2 surface areas and involves eight residues on each heterodimer. In addition to the disulphide bond (Cys135 ­Cys3 ), only five hydrogen bonds, but no van der Waals interactions, were observed. As shown in Figure 3, the amino-acid sequences of mucrocetin and FL-A have the same lengths of 135 and 125 for - and -subunits respectively, and they differ only in five and nine residues. The three cyclic tetramers in the crystal structure of mucrocetin can be superimposed on the tetramer of FL-A, with r.m.s.d. of 1.149­1.266 Å for 1040 pairs of C atoms. If the heterodimers are superimposed individually, the r.m.s.d. are 0.709­0.824 Å for 260 pairs of C atoms. The results appear to be not very different in all three cases. Mucrocetin does not contain bound calcium ions, whereas the two positively charged lysine residues, Lys130 and Lys122 , substituting for the cations in the binding sites, as in FL-A [14], are conserved. The surface potential diagrams of mucrocetin and FL-A show that the former seems to have more negative charges on the molecule, but the theoretical net charges of the two molecules differ by only one unit at neutral pH. Ten of the 14 different residues compared with FL-A in mucrocetin are located on the surface of the molecule (see Figure 4B). Although three residues are far away from others, Tyr97 , Arg123 , Val54 , Ser58 , His63 , Gln95 and Arg117 are in the vicinity of the concave binding surface and the positions of their side chains are close (Figure 4C). No obvious conformational changes are observed around the regions with residue substitutions. The concave surfaces of the mucrocetin molecule are facing outside and are not hindered from binding to effector molecules. Surfacecharge comparison of the corresponding region in mucrocetin and FL-A shows a significant difference of charge distribution (Figure 4D). In contrast with the structure of FL-A, the side chains of lysine residues at 102, 108, 109, 22, 102 and 116 in mucrocetin tend to point to solvents (Figure 4C). Combined with Arg123 and Arg117 , they form a unique positively charged patch on the binding surface of mucrocetin (Figure 4D).
DISCUSSION

Binding of plasma vWf to the platelet membrane GPIb­IX­V complex, with exposure to pathological shear stress (e.g. stenosed arteries), is an important event in triggering thrombosis in embolic stroke and cardiovascular disease [28]. This binding process can be modified by several exogenous modulators, including the Ctype lectin-like venom proteins. To date, a number of GPIb-BPs

have been isolated from the venoms of crotalid and viperid snakes (Table 1). These venom factors serve as useful tools in probing the mechanism of platelet activation and developing a new class of anti-thrombotic agents. In the present paper, we present a GPIb-BP, mucrocetin, isolated from the venom of Taiwan habu (T. mucrosquamatus). Mucrocetin has a structural organization almost identical with those of FL-A and convulxin [14,29]. The molecular mass of mucrocetin calculated from its amino-acid sequence is 121.1 kDa, smaller than those observed on SDS/PAGE (approx. 135 kDa) and gelpermeation chromatography (150­200 kDa), indicating a low compactness in mucrocetin molecules. This is in agreement with the crystal structure of mucrocetin, i.e. a square flat ring with a large central pore. Mucrocetin eluted from the anion-exchange column in the last fractions during the initial isolation step may reflect its acidic property. It is consistent with the observed negative charges on the surface of mucrocetin molecules. The predicted amino-acid sequence of mucrocetin was confirmed by protein N-terminal sequencing, and the complete sequence is also consistent with its crystal structure, including the distinct residues between mucrocetin and FL-A and those on the concave binding surface. Sequence alignment and comparison of mucrocetin subunits with those of other snake venom GPIbBPs show various degrees of identity from 38.5 % to 60.7 % in -subunits and 52.0 % to 71.2 % in -subunits with 24 and 30 identical residues respectively, suggesting that the -subunits are more conserved among these lectin-like venom proteins. Kawasaki et al. [11] proposed that the GPIb-binding site of venom GPIb-BPs resides on the -subunit, but not the -subunit. As shown in the structures of mucrocetin and FL-A, the additional Cys135 and Cys3 in the - and -subunit respectively, form an interdimer `head-to-tail' disulphide linkage. Thus, according to the sequence alignment [30], agglucetin probably possesses a similar interdimer disulphide bridge as well. Nevertheless, these two cysteine residues are not found in the sequence of alboaggregin A [15], in spite of its oligomeric feature. Mucrocetin dose-dependently induced platelet agglutinations on both PRP and washed platelets with similar turbidimetric profiles, indicating that vWf is not needed on the action of mucrocetin, distinguishable from what was observed on botrocetin and bitiscetin [4,5]. The inhibition studies, using FL-A and an antiGPIb mAb on mucrocetin-induced platelet agglutination, suggest that mucrocetin is a GPIb agonist with a binding site distinct from that of FL-A on GPIb. In addition, pre-treatment of PRP with mucrocetin showed no effect on the platelet aggregation when stimulated with ristocetin, whereas agglucetin, in a similar experiment performed by Wang and Huang [16], appeared to prevent such a ristocetin-induced aggregation markedly. The crystal structure of mucrocetin shows a unique crystal packing of six-layer cylinders of doughnut-shaped molecules. The overall structure of mucrocetin is almost identical with the structures of FL-A and convulxin [14,29], with the -heterodimer exhibiting the typical backbone fold of CRD of C-type lectins [31]. The swapped loops in the  heterodimer, which are well conserved among the venom GPIb-BPs, are associated with the globular body of the adjacent subunit. The resulting contact interface, corresponding to the C-interface defined in three-dimensional domain swapping [32], buries approx. 22.4 % of the total surface area of one  heterodimer, and is therefore crucial in connecting the two subunits of mucrocetin. The interface between the  heterodimers is stabilized mainly by interchain disulphide bridges, with only a few non-covalent interactions. The distinct behaviour of lectin-like venom proteins in recognizing different target molecules, such as coagulation factors, vWf and platelet GPIb, is thought to be in part due to the large

hinge-like motions at the bases of each swapped loop [19]. Only small movements occur when the venom proteins target similar molecules. Consistently, the backbone chain of mucrocetin superimposes well with that of FL-A, and the relative orientations of the - and -subunits of these two proteins are almost identical. The structure of the bitiscetin­vWf A1 complex reported by Maita et al. [33] suggested that a positively charged patch on the -subunit of bitiscetin may interact with the C-terminal anionic region of GPIb. However, this basic patch of bitiscetin was not observed in the structures of mucrocetin and FL-A. In addition, two hydrophilic patches were observed in the structure of FL-A -subunit [14], which are considered as possible candidates for the platelet GPIb-binding sites. In the structure of mucrocetin, these two peptide fragments were shown to exist as well (Figure 3). The central part of the concave surface in mucrocetin appears to bear more concentrated positive charges than that of FL-A (Figure 4D), although the overall negative charges of mucrocetin structure are slightly greater. Thus, based on these observations, the disparate platelet effects between mucrocetin and FL-A are likely to be the consequence of different charge distributions on the putative binding surface. Namely, the unique positively charged patch formed by several lysine and arginine residues on mucrocetin appears to be the primary determinant of the platelet-agglutinating activity of mucrocetin. The crystal structures of platelet GPIb and its complexes with vWf A1 domain or thrombin have been published [34­36]. Three negatively charged patches on the surface of GPIb were localized to regions that interact with vWf A1 domain and the exosites I and II of thrombin respectively. The interacting surfaces between GPIb and its bound ligands show the heterogeneous charge distributions and reflect striking charge complementarities. These acidic patches on GPIb may be the candidates of mucrocetintargeting site. More structural studies of mucrocetin in complex with GPIb are needed to elucidate the proposed interaction mechanism.
