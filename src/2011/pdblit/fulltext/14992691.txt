-Conotoxin GIC is a 16-residue peptide isolated from the venom of the cone snail Conus geographus. -Conotoxin GIC potently blocks the 32 subtype of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, showing a high selectivity for neuronal versus muscle subtype [McIntosh, Dowell, Watkins, Garrett, Yoshikami, and Olivera (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 33610­33615]. We have now determined the three-dimensional solution structure of -conotoxin GIC by NMR spectroscopy. The structure of -conotoxin GIC is well defined with backbone and heavy atom root mean square deviations (residues 2­16) of 0.53 Å and 0.96 Å respectively. Structure and surface comparison of -conotoxin GIC

with the other 4/7 subfamily conotoxins reveals unique structural aspects of -conotoxin GIC. In particular, the structural comparison between -conotoxins GIC and MII indicates molecular features that may confer their similar receptor specificity profile, as well as those that provide the unique binding characteristics of -conotoxin GIC. Key words: -conotoxin, Conus geographus (cone snail), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), NMR, solution structure, venom.

INTRODUCTION

-Conotoxins are small peptide toxins that are found in the venom of marine snails, Conus, and typically comprise 13­19 amino acid residues [1­3] (Table 1). -Conotoxins that contain two disulphide bridges, and their homologues, A-conotoxins, which are somewhat larger than -conotoxins, having three disulphide bridges, are all extremely potent antagonists against various subtypes of nAChRs (nicotinic acetylcholine receptors). These Conus peptides, hence, have been extensively used for studying the mechanism of ligand­nAChR interactions [4­8]. The 3/5 subfamily of conotoxins, such as GI, MI, and SI, as well as A subfamily conotoxins PIVA and EIVA, act on neuromuscular nAChRs. (The -conotoxins are grouped according to the number of amino acid residues enclosed within each disulphide loop. Loop sizes of three residues in the first loop and five in the second are denoted as 3/5. Other sub-families include 4/7 and 4/ 3.) Another subfamily of -conotoxins (MII, PnIA, AuIB, and GID) known as the 4/7 subfamily, has no or low activity against neuromuscular receptors, but potently blocks various subtypes of neuronal nAChRs. Since there are more than 500 different species of cone snails, each containing many neuropeptides, more novel peptide toxins from Conus venoms are yet to be discovered [3,9]. In order to fully understand the receptor subtype specificity of -conotoxins, much effort has gone into delineating key residues potentially involved in receptor binding using mutant nAChRs, as well as ligand analogues [4,10­12]. High-resolution structures of several -/A-conotoxins, determined mainly by NMR methods, have also been published [5­8,13­18]. Such efforts may eventually lead to development of novel neuromodulators useful for treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease or other nAChR-related diseases. Nevertheless, a clear picture of ligand­receptor binding is not likely to

be available without high-resolution three-dimensional structures of free and ligand-bound nAChRs, since nAChRs are complex heteropentameric proteins and the ligands need to bind to the interfaces of different subunits [19­21]. In the absence of suitable three-dimensional structures of nAChRs, structural comparison among various nAChR ligands has provided useful information regarding important pharmacophores involved in ligand­receptor interactions [18,22­26]. Our laboratory has been applying a `reverse-mapping strategy' to delineate key receptor contact residues within -conotoxins by comparing the structures of several -conotoxins with a similar molecular folding pattern, but which exhibit different receptor selectivities. Following this strategy, we were able to suggest the presence of a putative 1 subunit binding face within neuromuscular -/A-conotoxins [6], and to delineate potential receptor subtype-specific residues in neuronal -conotoxins [17]. The size of the ligand-binding pocket in nAChR was also inferred from the reverse mapping [6]. In the present study, we report the three-dimensional solution structure of -conotoxin GIC, a novel peptide from Conus geographus that potently blocks 32 nAChRs. The high selectivity for the 32 nAChR subtype makes the -conotoxin GIC structure valuable for integrating structure and activity studies of all the -conotoxins that discriminate between 32 versus other neuronal subtypes.

NMR assignments

NMR spectroscopy

Samples for the NMR acquisition were prepared in 90 % H2 O/ 10 % 2 H2 O or in 100 % 2 H2 O, pH 3.5, with a final concentration of 11.5 mM. All NMR experiments were performed using a Varian UNITY INOVA 600 spectrometer at 20  C and 10  C in order to obtain unambiguous resonance assignment. Mixing times of 150­400 ms for NOESY and 87 ms for TOCSY experiments [28] were used. 3 J HNH coupling constants for backbone torsion angles were measured using phase-sensitive double-quantumfiltered COSY experiments [29]. Spectral widths were 6 kHz in both dimensions. Typical two-dimensional NMR data consist of 2048 complex points in the t2 dimension with 256 complex t1 increments.
Structure calculations

The complete 1 H resonance assignment for -conotoxin GIC was achieved using double-quantum-filtered COSY, TOCSY and NOESY spectra, following the standard sequential assignment procedure [35]. Firstly, Ser4 , Pro6 , Gln13 and Ile15 were unambiguously assigned based on the COSY and TOCSY spectra according to their characteristic coherence transfer patterns. Due to their unique `back-transfer' cross-peaks, His5 and His14 were assigned using a TOCSY spectrum without relying on the NOE connectivity. For the other residues, classification of spin systems in a TOCSY spectrum, along amide NH resonances, preceded the sequential assignment procedure. Strong sequential d -type NOE cross-peaks were clearly observed for Pro6 , indicating that Pro6 has a trans conformation [36]. Due to trans­cis isomerization of proline, minor peaks originating from a cis conformer were observed. Detailed analyses of NMR data and structure calculation have been performed for the trans isomer. Figure 1 is a summary of short- and medium-range NOEs used for the resonance assignment, 3 J HNH , and CSI (chemical shift index) [37], together with the amino acid sequence of -conotoxin GIC.
Three-dimensional structure of -conotoxin GIC

A total of 181 NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) cross-peaks were manually assigned in the NOESY spectrum and seven dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3 J HNH coupling constants. Backbone torsion angle, , was set to - 120 (+ 20 ) when - 3 J HNH > 8 Hz and to - 65 (+ 20 ) if 3 J HNH < 6 Hz. Using these - data set, structures were calculated using ARIA (version 1.1) as described previously [30]. Floating chirality assignment [31,32] was employed for all methylene and isopropyl groups. A final set of 50 structures was calculated using the simulated annealing protocol from CNS SOLVE 1.1 [33]. In the last round of calculation, the NMR-derived experimental restraints included 314 unambiguous NOE restraints [155 intra-residue, 98 sequential, 45 medium-range (|i - j| < 4) and 16 long-range (|i - j| 4) interproton restraints], and 7 dihedral angle restraints. The 20 lowenergy structures of -conotoxin GIC were selected and a quality analysis of the final superimposed ensemble was performed using the program PROCHECK [34].

Figure 2 is the superposition of a final ensemble of 20 structures for -conotoxin GIC. The structure is well defined with backbone and heavy atom RMSDs (root mean square deviations) over residues 2­16 of 0.53 Å and 0.96 Å respectively. Further details on structure calculation is provided in Table 2. When subject to quality evaluation by PROCHECK, 87.9 % and 12.1 % of backbone dihedral angles of all non-glycine and non-proline residues were found to reside within the most favoured region and additional allowed region of the Ramachandran plot respectively. -Conotoxin GIC has an -shaped molecular backbone (Figure 2), a common structural feature of all 4/7 subfamily conotoxins. The secondary structure analysis with PROMOTIF [38] reveals that the toxin consists of two -turns and one amphipathic -helix. The N-terminal Cys2 ­His5 residues constitute a type I turn, whereas the C-terminal arm of the  fold contains a type IV -turn formed by residues Gln13 ­Cys16 . The helix is found at

along with -conotoxin GIC, in fact, constitute one of the major groups of the 4/7 subfamily (Table 1). High-resolution structures of these -conotoxins [7,14­16,18] are superimposed in Figure 3. All, but -conotoxin GID, have the common -backbone fold. The backbone RMSDs over residues 2­16 of -conotoxin GIC with the other toxins are 0.97 Å with MII (PDB accession no. 1M2C), 0.77 Å with PnIA (PDB accession no. 1PEN), 0.64 Å with PnIB (PDB accession no. 1AKG), 0.71 Å with [Tyr15]EpI (PDB accession no. 1A0M), and 1.18 Å with GID (PDB accession no. 1MTQ). The similar backbone topology of these -conotoxins suggests that differences in the nAChR rank order of potency among these toxins should originate from differences in the surface charge and size of the side chains [17,39,40]. The Nterminal disulphide loop of all of these -conotoxins contains a reasonably hydrophobic SP motif (shown in grey in Figure 3), where  is a variable residue and  is a hydrophobic residue, except for -conotoxin EpI. The binding of -conotoxins to nAChRs occurs at the interface where an -subunit is facing its partner non--subunit [19,41,42]. Hence, one may see that the N-terminal loop of -conotoxins mainly provides a motif that interacts with -subunits, whereas the C-terminal loop contains residues contacting non--subunits of nAChRs [6,13].

One face of this amphipathic helix comprises surface-exposed hydrophobic residues [Pro6 , Ala7 , Ala9 and Gly10 ], which hence are likely to be involved with receptor binding via hydrophobic interactions. The other face comprises hydrophilic residues, such as Ser4 , Asn11 , Asn12 and Gln13 .
Structural comparison of -conotoxin GIC with other 32-blocking -conotoxins

Other -conotoxins, such as MII, PnIA, EpI and GID, are also capable of antagonizing the 32 nAChR subtype. These toxins

Six members of the 4/7 subfamily conotoxins, including conotoxin GIC, exhibit antagonistic activity against the 32 nAChR subtype [7,27,43­46]. It should be noted that although each peptide blocks the 32 subtype, not only their individual IC50 values, but also their nAChR subtype-binding profiles differ to a significant degree. The observation that most of the 32 subtype-targeting -conotoxins also show activity against other subtypes, such as 7, 42 and 34 subtypes, is associated with the fact that these subunits all have originated from one ancestral gene and hence are capable of providing a similar ligandbinding environment. For example, -conotoxins GIC and MII show very high apparent binding affinities both for the 32 subtype and 6-containing subtypes, as indicated by their low nanomolar IC50 values, as the 3 and 6 subunits of nAChR are most homologous. Even though -conotoxins EpI and GID have similarly high apparent affinities to the 32 subtype they are also active against other receptor subtypes. Since -conotoxin PnIB binds to the 32 subtype with a weak apparent affinity, it is generally viewed as an 7 binder. One way of explaining diverse receptor subtype specificities and profiles of the 4/7 subfamily conotoxins, which have virtually the same backbone topology, is to examine differences in surface charge distribution. On one side of the 4/7 conotoxins GIC, MII, PnIA/B, EpI, and GID that antagonize the 32 nAChR subtype there is a rather large hydrophobic surface within the N-terminal loop region. Hydrophobic interaction is known as one of the important binding mechanisms for ligand­nAChR binding [4,47]. On the other side of these toxins one can find two sequential asparagines [Asn11 /Asn12 or Asn14 /Asn15 ] clustered in the middle, except for MII where the two are replaced by Glu11 and His12 , and for PnIB where Asn11 is replaced by a serine residue. This finding suggests that presence of such a hydrophobic surface on one side of the toxin in combination with two contiguous hydrophilic residues on the other side, such as asparagine, histidine or glutamic acid, is necessary for an -conotoxin to interact with the 32 subtype. Actual binding strength and full receptor specificity profile would, of course, be governed by the precise nature of such hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas, as well as by actual sequence differences in other parts of the

toxin. The fact that -conotoxin [N11S]PnIA is 24-fold less active against the 32 subtype than the wild-type [43] supports the notion that Asn11 is important for the 32 selectivity. Large contribution by one asparagine residue is not unreasonable, because a subtle difference in the orientation and length of a side chain can be crucial for hydrogen bonding in many protein­ protein interactions. Importance of residue 11 for receptor selectivity has been suggested in another 4/7 subfamily member, -conotoxin MII [24]. More recent results suggest that mutation of Glu11 to Ala in -conotoxin MII significantly decreases its activity at 32 without decreasing its activity at 62-containing nAChRs (J. M. McIntosh, unpublished work). Two members, in particular, of the 4/7 subfamily, -conotoxins GIC and MII, have a very similar receptor specificity profile, as well as high potency against the 32 subtype [27,45]. Thus a question arises as to how seven out of eight C-terminal residues in these toxins could be different (Table 1) when their biological properties are so similar. The surface charge analysis of the two toxins reveals that, despite the sequence variation, the two have a similar surface charge distribution. One should note that the electronic and steric states of a histidine are not much different from those of an asparagine at neutral pH. In fact, these two polar residues, which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds, are interchangeably found in -conotoxins (Table 1), as well as in conotoxins that target other ion channels [48,49]. Thus the remarkably similar pharmacological activity profile must arise from a similar surface charge distribution pattern found in -conotoxins GIC and MII. Such a conclusion is further supported by the fact that other 32 subtype targeting -conotoxins, such as PnIA, EpI, GID and PnIB, which have different receptor selectivity profiles from those of -conotoxins GIC and MII, indeed have substantially different surface charge distribution patterns from those of -conotoxins GIC and MII. Despite similarities, -conotoxins GIC and MII differ in a few aspects. For example, -conotoxin GIC is more than 100 000-fold selective for the 32 subtype versus the muscle receptor of nAChR. In contrast, -conotoxin MII is only approx. 1000-fold selective against the muscle receptor. In addition, high-affinity block of nAChRs by -conotoxin GIC can be reversed relatively rapidly upon toxin washout in contrast with the much slower reversibililty of -conotoxin MII [27].

Figure 4 Connolly surface comparison between -conotoxins GIC and MII in stereo view
In -conotoxins GIC (light grey) and MII (dark grey), some residues exposed out of the surface of the other molecule are labelled. Upper panels: a front view. Lower panels: a view from the other side.

These differences may be associated with the following differences between the two toxins. First, -conotoxin MII has the negatively charged Glu11 at the important position 11, whereas an Asn11 is found in -conotoxin GIC. Secondly, -conotoxin GIC is more hydrophilic than -conotoxin MII, as was demonstrated by the HPLC elution profile [27]; Ala7 and Gly10 that form the hydrophobic core of -conotoxin GIC are certainly less hydrophobic than Val7 and Leu10 in -conotoxin MII. Also, Gln13 in -conotoxin GIC is slightly more hydrophilic than Ser13 in -conotoxin MII. When a comparative surface exposure approach is applied to compare the -conotoxins GIC and MII, His5 , Gln13 and His14 of -conotoxin GIC become exposed out of the MII surface,

whereas Val7 , His9 , Leu10 , Glu11 and His12 of -conotoxin MII are exposed outside of the -conotoxin GIC surface (Figure 4). Note that Gln13 is the most solvent exposed residue within -conotoxin GIC. This Gln13 in -conotoxin GIC is particularly unique in that no other 4/7 subfamily members have a residue with such a long hydrophilic side chain. Other 4/7 members have either a smaller residue (a serine in MII) or hydrophobic residues, such as proline or hydroxyproline, at the corresponding position. The longer aliphatic side chain of Gln13 may allow -conotoxin GIC to interact better with a particular receptor subtype.
