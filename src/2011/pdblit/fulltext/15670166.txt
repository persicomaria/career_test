The interaction between the human copper(I) chaperone, HAH1, and one of its two physiological partners, the Menkes disease protein (ATP7A), was investigated in solution using heteronuclear NMR. The study was carried out through titrations involving HAH1 and either the second or the fifth soluble domains of ATP7A (MNK2 and MNK5, respectively), in the presence of copper(I). The copper-transfer properties of MNK2 and MNK5 are similar, and differ significantly from those previously observed for the yeast homologous system. In particular, no stable adduct is formed between either of the MNK domains and HAH1. The copper(I) transfer reaction is slow on the time scale of the NMR chemical shift, and the equilibrium is significantly shifted towards the formation of copper(I)­ MNK2 / MNK5. The solution structures of both apo- and copper(I)MNK5, which were not available, are also reported. The results are discussed in comparison with the data available in the literature for the interaction between HAH1 and its partners from other spectroscopic techniques.

Copper, an essential trace metal, is utilized as a cofactor in a variety of redox and hydrolytic proteins, which, in eukaryotes, are found in various cellular locations [1]. However, the amount of copper is presumably strictly controlled and a complex machinery of proteins that bind the metal ion strictly controls the uptake, transport, sequestration and efflux of copper in vivo [2­4]. In particular, so-called metallochaperones deliver copper to specific intracellular targets, acting like enzymes to lower the activation barrier for copper transfer to their specific partners [5]. A fast kinetics of metal transfer may circumvent the significant thermodynamic overcapacity for copper chelation of cytoplasm components [6].

One of the pathways of copper transfer present in humans involves HAH1 (also known as Atox1), a small soluble metallochaperone [7,8], which is capable of delivering copper(I) both to the Menkes and the Wilson disease proteins (ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively; EC 3.6.3.4) [2­4]. The latter two proteins are membrane-bound P-type ATPases that translocate copper in the trans-Golgi network or across the plasma membrane [2­4], depending on environmental conditions [9]. In fact, both proteins experience copperregulated trafficking between the Golgi and plasma membranes [9]. ATP7A and ATP7B have a long N-terminal cytosolic tail containing six putative metal-binding domains. Homologues of HAH1 and

Interaction between HAH1 and ATP7A

L. Banci et al.

ATP7A / ATP7B are found in a large number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The number of metal-binding domains in ATP7A / ATP7B homologues is variable, ranging from one to six, with proteins from higher eukaryotic organisms, e.g. mammals, having a higher number of such domains than prokaryotic (typically one or two) or yeast (two) homologues [10,11]. The reasons why higher organisms have as many as six metal-binding domains are still unclear. Available studies on ATP7A or ATP7B trying to address this matter indicate some functional differentiation between the first four (counting from the N-terminus) and the last two domains, and suggest that the last two domains are sufficient for function [12­14]. In addition, the mechanism of copper(I) transfer from HAH1 to either human ATPase is not completely elucidated. In this respect, it is noteworthy that homology modelling of the ATP7A metal-binding domains shows significant variations among the various domains in the electrostatic surface implicated in partner recognition, potentially making it possible for them to interact with one another [11]. At present, high-resolution data mapping the regions of interaction between an HAH1 homologue and a soluble metal-binding domain from an ATPase are available only for the yeast [15] and the Bacillus subtilis [16] systems. The data obtained on the yeast proteins have been used to determine a three-dimensional structure for the protein adduct [17]. Even though the sequence similarity between yeast Atx1 and HAH1, as well as between the domains of yeast Ccc2 and human ATP7A / ATP7B, is remarkable, there are several well-documented structural differences that warrant direct investigation of the human proteins. In particular, human HAH1 has been shown to bind copper(I) in a linear bidentate fashion [18,19], whereas in Atx1 the copper(I) ion is tricoordinate [20], with two ligands provided by the protein and a third by a reductant molecule recruited from the solution. Also the extent of structural variation upon copper(I) binding observed in Atx1 is different and significantly larger than for HAH1 [19]. The electrostatic potential at the surface of Atx1 and HAH1 is quite similar, but that of the metal binding domains of Ccc2 is somewhat different from ATP7A / ATP7B [11]. In addition, although the two metal-binding domains of Ccc2 are very similar as far as electrostatic features are concerned, the six domains of ATP7A / ATP7B differ widely in this same respect, even showing charge reversals. There seems also to be some differentiation among the ATP7A domains with respect to the structural and dynamic effects of copper(I) binding [21].

In this study we investigated using high-resolution NMR the interaction between HAH1 and two different soluble domains of ATP7A: the second (MNK2 hereafter) and the fifth (MNK5 hereafter). The solution structure of both the apo- and copper(I)-form of MNK2 was already available [21]. No NMR assignment or structural data were instead available for MNK5, which has been expressed in Escherichia coli, and structurally characterized by NMR in this study. Particular interest in the study of the interaction between HAH1 and MNK2 is due to the recent proposition that the second soluble domain of ATP7B, which has a pI quite close to that of MNK2, is the first entry point for delivery of copper(I) ions by HAH1 to the ATPase [22].

Results
NMR spectra assignment and structural calculations Backbone assignments for MNK5 were obtained using standard strategies based on triple resonance experiments [23]. In 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra the resonances of the backbone amide moieties of residues 13­17 were not detectable nor were those of the residues in the C-terminal tag. As in the case of MNK2, where only two residues escaped detection [21], the lack of signals from residues in the metal-binding loop is likely to originate from conformational exchange processes. Variations in the chemical shifts between apo- and copper(I)­MNK5 are observed for residues close (in sequence) to the binding loop, as reported previously for similar systems [21,24,25], and, to a small extent, for residue 65. NMR 1 assignments have been deposited in the BMRB. One thousand two hundred and twenty-seven and 1121 meaningful upper distance limits were used for structure calculations of apo­MNK5 and copper(I)­ MNK5, respectively. In addition, 37 / and 37 w torsion angles were constrained in each protein form. The structures obtained and the constraints used for calculations have been deposited in the PDB (codes 1Y3K and 1Y3J). The final (after REM refinement) apo­ MNK5 and copper(I)­MNK5 families have an average ° total target function of  0.30 A2 (CYANA units), and an average backbone root mean square deviation ° (RMSD) values (over residues 2­73) of  0.70 A; the all heavy atoms RMSD value instead was instead °  1.20 A.

Interaction between HAH1 and ATP7A

Interaction between MNK5 and HAH1 The interaction of MNK5 and HAH1 was studied by titrating 15N-enriched apo­MNK5 into 15N-enriched copper(I)­HAH1. As observed for MNK2, there is no detectable formation of a protein / protein adduct, and the copper(I) transfer equilibrium is slow on the chemical shift time scales. Already at the first addition of apo­MNK5 (MNK5 / HAH1 ratio  1 : 5), signals due to copper(I)­MNK5 appeared, with an intensity significantly higher than those of apo­MNK5. Only after an excess of apo­MNK5 with respect to copper(I)­ HAH1 is reached, was a steady increase of the intensities of apo­MNK5 signals observed, although the signals of copper(I)­MNK5 did not increase significantly. These data are consistent with the copper(I) transfer process favouring the formation of copper(I)­MNK5. The titration data can be fit to an equilibrium constant similar to that observed in the case of HAH1. In parallel, the intensity of the signals of copper(I)­HAH1 in the HSQC spectra decreased steadily along all the titration, and apo(I)­HAH1 was formed.

the ferredoxin-like babbab fold. The RMSD between the backbone atoms for the mean structures of the two families of conformers, excluding the metal-binding loop region and the poorly defined C-terminal tail is °  1.1 A. Interaction between MNK2 and HAH1 To investigate the interaction of MNK2 with HAH1, we titrated 15N-enriched copper(I)­MNK2 with unlabelled apo­HAH1, and followed the process via 1 H-15N HSQC spectra. No variation in the chemical shifts of the amide signals in copper(I)­MNK2 could be observed at any stage of the titration. Instead, the intensities of signals decreased with increasing HAH1 concentration. Concomitantly, signals corresponding to apo­MNK2 appeared and increased in intensities along the titration (Fig. 2). No additional signals from a possible (transiently populated) intermediate could be detected at any point of the titration. The above data thus indicate that an adduct between MNK2 and HAH1 does not form at detectable concentration, even if an interaction between the two proteins does occur, resulting in copper(I) transfer. The latter process is slow on the chemical shift time scale, setting an upper limit for the equilibration rate of  102)103 s)1 (determined by the smallest chemical shift difference between apo­MNK2 and copper(I)­ MNK2 that can be detected, i.e.  0.1 p.p.m). The profiles of signal intensity as a function of the MNK2 / HAH1 molar ratio can be fitted with an equilibrium constant for the transfer of copper(I) from HAH1 to MNK2 between 5.0 and 10 (Fig. 3). The relatively high spread of the data in Fig. 3 is due to the fact that during the titration some broadening of the signals occurs, to a different extent at different HAH1 / MNK2 ratios. This contributes to scattering the values of the signal integrals.

Discussion
As expected, in solution MNK5 adopts the classical babbab ferredoxin fold regardless of the presence of the metal ion. As observed for other proteins of this class [26,27], in copper(I)­MNK5 the copper ion is close to the protein surface and solvent exposed. Chemical shift variations observed between apo­ MNK5 and copper(I)­MNK5 indicate that perturbations due to copper(I) binding affect mainly the Cyscontaining loop (loop 1). Indeed, the comparison of the two structures highlights that this is the region where structural rearrangement occurs upon metal binding, while the remainder of the polypeptide chain does not experience significant conformational changes (Fig. 1). For the two copper(I)-binding cysteines, it is difficult to appreciate the extent of conformational rearrangement as their conformation in the two families is not very precisely defined. Overall, the behaviour of MNK5 upon copper(I) binding is similar to what observed for MNK2 [21]. The behaviour observed for the interaction of HAH1 with MNK2 and MNK5 is somewhat different from that observed for the yeast homologues [15], and from that observed for Bacillus subtilis CopZ and CopA [16]. In the latter two systems an adduct is formed in fast (with respect to the time scale of NMR chemical shifts) equilibrium with the two separate proteins. This was evident from the fact that in a mixture of two partners in the presence of only one equivalent

of copper, only a single set of signals from each protein was detected, as a result of fast averaging between the apo- and copper(I)-loaded forms [15,16]. Formation of an adduct in solution was apparent from the measurement of protein tumbling rates in solution [15,16]. Instead, in the present case of the interaction of HAH1 with MNK2 and MNK5 a slow equilibrium is observed. The absence of additional signals, besides those of the apo- and copper(I)-loaded proteins, indicates that there is no accumulation of a protein / protein adduct in solution. However, copper(I) transfer between HAH1 and MNK2 / MNK5 is clearly observed, indicating that an interaction does occur. Indeed, formation of an adduct can be detected through surface plasmon resonance measurements, with a kon for formation of the adduct of the order of 102)103 m)1Æs)1 [28].

Interaction between HAH1 and ATP7A

interaction with the partner that is quite similar to that of yeast Atx1, in spite of its lower pI (6.7 vs. 8.6). Figure 4 (upper) shows a comparison of the electrostatic surface of HAH1 and Atx1, highlighting the strong positive potential at the putative interaction region. By contrast, MNK2 is possibly the metal-binding domain in ATP7A most different from either of the two domains of yeast Ccc2 with respect to electrostatic properties. Indeed, MNK2 has a pI of 8.7 vs. 4.3­4.4 for the two domains of Ccc2. The pI of MNK5 is instead 6.4. As can be seen from Fig. 4 (lower), there is little similarity between the electrostatic potential at the surface of MNK2, MNK5 and Ccc2. The poor energetics of electrostatic interaction between MNK2 / MNK5 and HAH1 is such that the formation of a long-lived Cu(I)MNK2 / (MNK5 / HAH1) adduct is unfavourable, as indicated by the behaviour of the NMR signals along titrations. Consequently, we can observe experimentally only the copper(I) exchange process. The thermodynamic contribution to the formation of the adduct resulting from the formation of copper(I)-bridged heterodimers is not sufficient to stabilize the adduct. In this respect it is worth noting that reversal of the charge of amino acids at the Atx1 / Ccc2 interface is known to be able to abolish their interaction altogether [29] as

does mutation of the metal-binding cysteines to serines [28]. The data are thus consistent with a mechanism in which HAH1 and any of the ATP7A metal-binding domains interact via an unstable bi-molecular intermediate (transition state), whose concentration in solution at equilibrium is too low to allow detection by NMR. The intermediate could form through a copper(I) bridge, with the metal ion coordinated by one or two cysteines of both molecules. It is possible to speculate that the formation of the bridged intermediate should logically constitute the slow step in the copper(I) transfer reaction, while dissociation of the intermediate immediately after copper(I) transfer should be fast due to the poor energetics of interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 4). In the yeast system, attraction between residues of opposite charge at the surface of the two partners stabilizes the intermediate, which becomes detectable by NMR (and can be structurally characterized) [15,17]. Note that key residues of Ccc2 involved in the formation of the latter adduct [17] are indeed nonconservatively replaced in the two MNK domains studied here. The copper(I) transfer process has an equilibration constant of the order of 5­10, with the soluble domains of ATP7A being better ligands for copper(I) than HAH1. In other words, our data are consistent with the copper(I)-binding constant of MNK2 and MNK5 being 5­10 times that of HAH1. The same ratio is close to one for yeast Atx1 / Ccc2 [5]. This result is in agreement with competition experiments performed on HAH1 and the second metal-binding domain of the ATP7B (Wilson) protein (WND2 hereafter), which showed that WND2 has a higher affinity for copper(I) than HAH1 [22]. In contrast, isothermal titration calorimetry performed on HAH1 and various constructs of ATP7B present a relatively complex picture in which the number of metal-binding domains contained in each specific construct appeared to affect significantly copper(I) capabilities [30]. In fact, the binding constant of a given domain could differ by a 10-fold in a twodomain construct with respect to the entire six-domain construct, thereby possibly making HAH1 a copper(I) ligand as good as the ATP7B domains [30]. If the above data are relevant also to the ATP7A protein studied here, it should be concluded that the affinity of each domain for copper(I) is dependent on the context within which it is located. Long-range interactions between different metal-binding domains should then reduce the affinity for copper(I) of the individual metal-binding domains with respect to the `intrinsic' affinity of the isolated domain, which, as shown here, is higher than that of the chaperone.

Interaction between HAH1 and ATP7A

L. Banci et al.

It has been proposed for the ATP7B protein that the second metal-binding domain constitutes the preferred one for the uptake of the first metal ion by the ATPase from the chaperone, as a result of the specificity of protein­protein interactions between WND2 and HAH1 [22]. Our data suggest that a preferential (with respect to the other metal-binding domains of ATP7A) protein­protein interaction between MNK2 and HAH1 is unlikely. Given that the surface charges of MNK2 and WND2 are fairly similar, a preferential interaction of the chaperone with the second domain seems unlikely also in the case of ATP7B. The selectivity, if any, for the interaction of one of the six metalbinding domains with the chaperone should thus result from the global conformation of the entire soluble portion of the ATPases.

Materials and methods
HAH1 and MNK2 samples were produced as described previously [19,21]. The protocol adopted to clone, express and purify MNK5 was essentially the same as that used for MNK2 [21]. The main exception was that samples retaining the poly(His) tag were used to record the spectra for NMR frequency assignments as they showed a markedly longer lifetime. Comparison of two-dimensional HSQC and NOESY spectra of MNK5 with and without the poly(His) tag shows that there is no detectable interaction between the tag and the remainder of the protein and that the solution structure of MNK5 is not sensitive to the presence of the tag. Recombinant protein characterization, NMR frequency assignments and solution structure determination of MNK5 in both the apo- and copper(I) forms were carried out following the same approach used for NMK2 [21], and showed MNK5 to be monomeric in solution in both forms. Copper(I)­MNK5 was found from atomic absorption measurements to bind one copper(I) ion per protein molecule. The procedure used for NMR titrations was the same as described in a previous study from our laboratory reporting on the interaction between yeast Atx1 and Ccc2 [15]. Protein concentrations were typically around 0.3­0.5 mm; titrations were carried out up to protein ratios of 4 : 1.
