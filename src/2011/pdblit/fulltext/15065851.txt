ABSTRACT: We present and analyze the structure of the oligonucleotide d(ATATAT) found in two different forms by X-ray crystallography and in solution by NMR. We find that in both crystal lattices the oligonucleotide forms an antiparallel double helical duplex in which base pairing is of the Hoogsteen type. The double helix is apparently very similar to the standard B-form of DNA, with about 10 base pairs per turn. However, the adenines in the duplex are flipped over; as a result, the physicochemical features of both grooves of the helix are changed. In particular, the minor groove is narrow and hydrophobic. On the other hand, d(ATATAT) displays a propensity to adopt the B conformation in solution. These results confirm the polymorphism of AT-rich sequences in DNA. Furthermore, we show that extrahelical adenines and thymines can be minor groove binders in Hoogsteen DNA.

In this paper, we present a new crystal structure of the oligonucleotide d(ATATAT). It forms antiparallel duplexes in which Watson-Crick pairing has been replaced by Hoogsteen pairing (Figure 1). These results support our previous study (1) and demonstrate that Hoogsteen pairing in DNA duplexes may be found under a variety of conditions. In fact, a recent theoretical analysis (2) shows that the energies of Hoogsteen and B-form DNAs are practically identical. We analyze in detail the conformation of Hoogsteen DNA by comparing the structures found in two different crystal forms. We have also studied the solution structure of this oligonucleotide by NMR. Soon after the model of the double helix was proposed (3) efforts were made to demonstrate that the different features of the model were correct. A surprise came when Hoogsteen (4) and other investigators (5) found that adenine and thymine paired in crystals in a different way, called Hoogsteen pairing. However, a large number of studies, including the X-ray structure of many protein-DNA complexes and, in particular, X-ray and NMR studies of oligonucleotides, have shown that the normal way of pairing in duplex DNA is the one suggested by Watson and Crick. To our surprise, we have found (1) that the hexanucleotide d(ATATAT) could fully crystallize in the Hoogsteen mode.

Despite the lack of detailed crystallographic studies, it is known that DNA sequences rich in adenine and thymine are strongly polymorphic (6-9), even in the presence of standard Watson-Crick base pairs. Alternative base pairing schemes have been found in other cases (10-12). Isolated Hoogsteen base pairs are formed in some special cases as in the closing loop of DNA hairpins (13-15) and in circular oligonucleotides (16). Also when the nucleic acid structure is chemically modified (17, 18) or the DNA is locally influenced by either drug intercalation (19) or some protein interactions (20, 21). Hoogsteen base pairs are found in triple helices (22) and have also been suggested in models for fiber diffraction patterns of dTpdA (23). METHODS AND MATERIALS Crystallization and Structure Determination. The palindromic deoxyhexanucleotide d(ApTpApTpApTp) and its bromo-uracil derivative at position four were crystallized at 13 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique. Crystals could be obtained from sodium cacodylate buffer (25 mM, pH 6) containing spermine (3 mM) and either Na+

were omitted. Because of twinning and pseudosymmetry, the solution was not straightforward. The details of the successful protocol as well as the initial refinement procedure are described elsewhere (25). Further refinement was performed with CNS (26) using the scripts for the merohedral twinning case and monitored through the free-R test (27). Attempts to refine two of the extrahelical terminal bases in the weak residual density observed in the minor groove did not result in either an improvement of the electron density maps or in a significant lowering of R values. So the final model contains only two extrahelical bases, and the other two were omitted, as shown in Figure 2a. A few water molecules were added at this stage. The R twin fraction was recalculated using the current model. Simulated annealing was performed to eliminate any model bias introduced by the starting model. It was followed by a gradient conjugate minimization. The water molecules were fixed and, hydrogen bonds were restrained. A final atomic B-factor refinement ended the process. Further details on refinement statistics of the P65 structure are given in Table 1. An example of the electron density map is given in Figure 1. Coordinates for both models have been deposited at NDB (code UD0035 for P21 and UD0049 for P65). NMR Spectroscopy. NMR samples were prepared in 500 µL of either D2O or 9:1 H2O/D2O. The resulting buffer solution (25 mM phosphate, 1 M KCl, pH ) 7.0) was about 2 mM in duplex. The spectra were acquired in a Bruker DMX spectrometer operating at 600 MHz, and processed with the UXNMR software. DQF-COSY, TOCSY (28), and NOESY (29) experiments were recorded in D2O and in 90% H2O/ 10% D2O. All 2D experiments were carried out at -2 °C. The NOESY spectra in D2O were acquired with mixing times of 200 ms, and 100 ms in H2O. TOCSY spectra were recorded with 80-ms mixing times. A jump-and-return pulse sequence (30) was employed to observe the rapidly exchanging protons in H2O experiments. The spectral analysis program XEASY (31) was used for the assignment of the NOESY cross-peaks. RESULTS Crystal Structure. In the P21 structure previously described (1), it was found that the DNA duplexes form infinite parallel columns of pseudocontinuous helices as shown in Figure 2. Hexamer and tetramer duplexes alternate in such columns. The tetramers have two extrahelical AT bases, with T inserted in the minor groove of neighbor hexamers. The P65 structure, which we now report, is also shown in Figure 2. It has similar infinite columns of tetramer/hexamer duplexes, but in this case parallel columns are organized in planes which cross each other at 60° angles. One of the extrahelical thymines enters the minor groove of a neighbor column in the same plane, as shown in Figures 2-4. The other extra-

Diffraction X-ray data were collected at either DESY (Hamburg, Germany) or ESRF (Grenoble, France) synchrotron radiation sources. Full data collection and structure refinement statistics have been given elsewhere for the P21 structure (1). A summary is given in Table 1. The P21 structure was solved by using anomalous diffraction data of the Br atoms. On the other hand, the P65 structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (24) using as search model the structure of the same sequence previously solved at 2.5 Å in a different space group (1). The extrahelical bases

FIGURE 3: Comparison of the position of the extrahelical bases (shown in red) in the P21 (left, middle) and P65 crystal structures (right). At the right of each drawing, the three terminal bases of an hexamer duplex are shown, with thymine in the minor groove. Note that the position of adenines and the relative height of neighbor hexamers is different in each case. Thymines occupy practically identical positions associated by hydrogen bonding with the second thymine at either end of the hexamer duplex, as shown in detail in Figure 4.

FIGURE 4: Close-up view of the looped-out bases and details of the interactions of the minor groove with either thymine in the P65 structure (left) or adenine in the P21 structure (right). In both cases, a nitrogen atom of the external base forms a hydrogen bond with an O2 atom of thymine from the duplex. Note the strong similarity of both types of interaction. The looped out thymines in P21 show the same structure, as it is apparent in Figure 3. In the case of adenine, the phosphodiester backbone folds back and the base enters into the minor groove of the same duplex, while the terminal thymine enters into a neighbor duplex (Figure 3, left).

helical thymine also enters the minor groove of a neighbor hexamer, but in the next plane of duplexes: it appears to occupy different alternative positions, since it could not be uniquely located in the electron density map. It should be noted that in both cases the crystal structure presents several channels full of solvent, which explain the limited resolution of the data collected. The volume of crystal occupied by a base pair is 1478 Å3/base pair in P65 and 1573 Å3/base pair in P21, significantly larger than in the usual B-form crystals (about 1300 Å3/base pair). No water molecules could be detected forming duplex-duplex bridges between the layers of the P65 structure, a fact that indicates a limited order in this interlayer region. The latter observation is consistent with the lack of order found in the AT bridge which extends from one layer to the next. Hoogsteen Pairing. The electron density found in our structure can only be matched when the bases are placed in a Hoogsteen conformation. Furthermore, the C1-C1 distance is only 8.12 Å on the average, as expected for a Hoogsteen conformation, and quite different from the 10.85 Å distance found in B-form DNA. Hydrogen bonds have normal distances. Their values are given in Table 2. The O2 of thymine also forms a weak hydrogen bond with C8 of adenine, which is longer than normal, as also shown in Table 2. Perhaps due to this fact the Hoogsteen base pairs may have a greater variability of hydrogen bond distances as indicated by the standard deviations given in Table 2. An additional point to note is that the presence of bromo-uracil instead of thymine does not have any noticeable effect on either the dimensions of the Hoogsteen base pairs or the duplex structure in general. An obvious result of Hoogsteen

base pairing is that the nucleotide conformation changes from anti to syn, with values of the glycosidic angle in the range 60-90°. A similar change is found in Z-form DNA, where the guanine base undergoes a similar rotation. Duplex Structure. The overall appearance of the Hoogsteen duplex is very similar to standard B-form DNA, as it is apparent from Figure 2. A space filling model is given in Figure 5. Its helical parameters are also very similar (Table 3). Within the duplex hexamers and tetramers, the average twist is about 34.6°, which corresponds to 10.4 base pairs/ turn, practically identical to B-form DNA. The minor groove is narrow due to the shorter C1-C1 distances, as it is apparent in Figure 5. It ranges between 9.3 and 11.1 Å. Similar values are also found in some AT-rich oligonucleotides crystallized in the B-form (32). The main difference with B-form DNA lies in the change in the accessibility of the grooves toward interaction with solvent/proteins. The N3 atom of adenine, which lies in the minor groove in B-form DNA, is now moved to the major groove. As a result the minor groove becomes less elec-

Note that in the latter case, the C5 atom is moved toward the bases as discussed in the text. Bottom, the endto-end interaction between tetramers and hexamers, which is analogous to a TA step. By comparison with the middle figure, it is apparent that the upper base pair slides toward the right. All equivalent base steps in both P21 and P65 structures are practical identical with those shown in this figure.

tronegative (Figure 5); it has a single hydrogen bond acceptor atom (O2 of thymine). This fact, together with the narrowness of the minor groove, indicates that it may become an appropriate target for interaction with hydrophobic groups, as it is actually found in our structures and will be discussed below. There are a few other features that differentiate Hoogsteen DNA from standard B-form DNA: the position of the helical axis, the degree of overlap of consecutive base pairs and some conformational angles. The helical axis is now found at the edge of the base pairs, approximately at the midpoint of the hydrogen bond between adenine N6 and thymine O4.

The major groove is in the center of the helix, and the phosphates are externally located, a situation also found in A-form DNA. The oligonucleotide we have studied has an alternating sequence, and therefore it has two types of base steps: AT and TA. In B-form DNA the latter base steps differ considerably in the twist parameter (32), whereas in the Hoogsteen case the twist value is similar in both cases. The stacking of base pairs is also different in both DNA forms. In Hoogsteen DNA, there is a very good overlap of the aromatic rings in the TA steps and very poor in the AT steps (Figure 6), whereas the opposite is true in B-form DNA (32). Furthermore, in the Hoogsteen form in some of the TA base steps the conformational R/ angles appears in a g+/gconformation, which is seldom found in B-form DNA, although it is common in the Z-form (33). The net result of this change in conformation is that the C5 atom is placed in an inner position in the duplex, whereas in the usual g-/g+ conformation it lies in a more external position, as it is apparent in Figure 6. Hydration. The pattern of external hydrogen bonding sites in Hoogsteen DNA is clearly different from the other canonical DNA forms. In the Hoogsteen structure, the base atoms which can form hydrogen bonds are mainly on the major groove side. The latter is covered by a network of water molecules, both in the P21 and P65 structures (Figure 7). They form hydrogen bonds among themselves, with phosphate oxygens and with the exposed nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the bases. In particular, most of the N1

Abrescia et al. End-to-End Interactions. A characteristic feature of the crystal structures found for d(ATATAT) is that, despite the different packing arrangements in space groups P21 and P65, the asymmetric unit is very similar in both cases. It contains two duplexes, a hexamer and a tetramer, the latter with two extrahelical AT arms. An additional similarity is found in end-to-end interactions between tetramer and hexamer (Figure 6). Both duplexes form a pseudocontinuous helix, despite the absence of phosphate in the steps between the terminal T of one duplex and the starting A of the next duplex in the column. The value of the twist parameter in this step is about 41° (Table 3), larger that the average value of 34.4° inside the duplex. Such difference should be considered rather small, given the absence of any phosphate binding both duplexes. A more striking feature is the large value of the slide parameter (-4.9 Å), which indicates that the hexamer and tetramer helical axes are shifted. This is most clearly seen in Figure 2b: in the central column of duplexes it is obvious that the tetramer (purple) is displaced upward with respect to the hexamer (green). As a result of this shift, the overlap of bases in neighbor base pairs is modified. In the end-to-end TA step, the base pairs slide laterally (Figure 6, bottom), whereas in the inner base pairs there is a very good overlap of the aromatic rings of thymine and adenine in all TA steps (Figure 6, center). In the endto-end interaction, only a partial overlap of adenines is found. Such interactions are practically identical in both P21 and P65 structures. It is worth comparing such interaction with that found in equivalent situations in the B-form, although there are only a few crystal structures with a terminal A,T base pair (34, 35). The five structures reported by the latter authors are not isomorphous, but all of them contain columns of duplexes with end-to-end interactions equivalent to TA steps as in the case of the Hoogsteen structures reported here. Inspection of the coordinates of all five structures shows that all of them present a similar left-handed twist between terminal base pairs of about -20°. As a result there is a very good overlap of A and T bases of neighbor duplexes. Interestingly, in the structure of the ras12 oligonucleotide (36), the TG/CA base step between duplexes also shows the same negative twist. In conclusion, end-to-end interactions in pseudo continuous duplexes are quite different in Hoogsteen and B-form DNA crystals. This is probably due to the different dipole moments associated with either Hoogsteen or Watson-Crick base pairs. End-to-end interactions between duplexes may contribute to the stabilization of the Hoogsteen conformation in the crystal. Structure of d(ATATAT) in Solution. The presence of duplexes in Hoogsteen conformation in d(ATATAT) crystals was quite unexpected. Therefore, we decided to study the behavior in solution of this oligonucleotide by NMR. The 1D spectrum in 1 M KCl at -2 °C is shown in Figure 8. Three imino resonances are observed between 13 and 14 ppm, indicating that all the thymines are base paired. In the NOESY spectra, these imino signals present NOE crosspeaks with adenine H2 protons, which were identified by their relatively long spin-lattice relaxation times. Other nonexchangeable protons were assigned using established techniques for right-handed, double-stranded nucleic acids using DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and 2D NOESY spectra (37). Sugar spin systems were identified in the DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra and connected with their own base and their

atoms of adenines are hydrogen bonded to a water molecule. In the Hoogsteen conformation, the N1 atom lies on the major groove side, whereas in Watson-Crick base pairs it is hydrogen bonded to thymine. The minor groove has only the O2 atom of thymine which could accept a hydrogen bond from water. Furthermore, the minor groove is occupied by extrahelical bases, which prevent hydration. Thus, we have found a single water molecule in the center of the minor groove in the P21 hexamer, hydrogen bonded to an O2 thymine atom and a sugar O4. Two of the water molecules we have found in the P21 structure form a bridge between the external N3 atom of adenine and a neighboring phosphate group, which may contribute to stabilize the Hoogsteen structure. Extrahelical Residues. An additional feature of the results we have obtained is that some of the bases occupy extrahelical positions. In both crystal structures, there are 20 bases in a duplex conformation and four extrahelical bases. As shown in Figures 2-4, terminal thymine residues enter the minor groove of a neighbor duplex. In all cases, the N3 atom of the extrahelical thymine is hydrogen bonded to the O2 atom of another thymine in the duplex, as shown in detail in Figure 4. One of the adenines in the P21 structure also shows a similar interaction. In the latter case, the extrahelical arm of the oligonucleotide folds back and adenine enters the minor groove of the same duplex. This adenine occupies a fixed position, its B-factors are similar to those shown by adenines in duplex conformation. Here it is the N6 atom of adenine which is hydrogen bonded to the O2 atom of a thymine in the duplex (Figure 4). Both extrahelical bases are stabilized by van der Waals contacts with neighbor atoms in the minor groove. This form of interaction is reminiscent of minor groove binding drugs. In the present case, such interactions contribute to the stability of the crystal, since they form bridges between neighbor columns of duplexes (Figure 2). Whereas extrahelical thymine residues occupy a similar position in all cases, each adenine shows a different conformation. In both P21 and P65 one of the extra helical adenines is found in an external position on the major groove of the next duplex in the crystal (Figure 3). They are stabilized by van der Waals forces and their position is not strongly fixed: they have the highest B-factors in both P21 and P65 structures. In fact, one group of extrahelical AT base in the P65 case appears to be disordered and could not be localized with certainty in the electron density map. Nevertheless, a peak of electron density was modeled in this region as a water molecule, which turned out to have the lowest B-factor in the whole structure.

Hoogsteen DNA

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 14, 2004 4097 also characteristic of a right-handed Watson-Crick duplex. Except for the amino resonances of adenines 1 and 5, all the exchangeable DNA protons could be assigned. The NOE patterns observed for the exchangeable protons indicate that all bases are forming Watson-Crick pairs throughout the duplex. Thus, we can conclude that under the experimental conditions we have used, d(ATATAT) in solution has a standard B-form conformation. A few unusual NOEs involving the H2 of A1 are observed (see Figure 8). Most probably, they are associated with an enhanced fraying effect in the terminal adenines. It should be noticed that this short duplex is not very stable, as confirmed by melting studies (38). The imino resonances are not observed at 5 °C, indicating that the duplex is mainly denatured at this temperature. Given that the NOESY experiments were conducted at -2 °C, some mobility effect in the terminal nucleotides is not surprising. NMR spectra were also acquired for other DNA duplexes of related sequences, like d(ATATATATAT)2 and d(ATATATAT)2. Details on the NMR study of these molecules will be presented elsewhere. Different experimental conditions were tested to simulate the crystal environment, such as adding increasing quantities of MPD. In an attempt to simulate the effect of the extrahelical thymines that interact with the minor groove of the Hoogsteen duplex in the crystal, deuterated thymidines were added to the NMR samples. However, in all cases the NMR data show that these oligonucleotides mainly form standard Watson-Crick duplexes in solution. The UV spectra and melting curves did not show either any feature that might indicate the presence of Hoogsteen DNA (38). Since thus far we have not found a Hoogsteen duplex in solution, it may appear that packing interactions in the crystal could induce the formation of Hoogsteen DNA. Nevertheless, a similar duplex structure is found in crystals with different symmetry, as shown in Figure 2. In any case, the Hoogsteen conformation is an additional conformation available for duplex DNA, at least for alternating AT sequences. In fact, energy calculations and molecular dynamics studies indicate that the Hoogsteen and B-form of duplex DNA have a similar stability (2). DISCUSSION PreVious Studies with AT-Rich DNA. As discussed in the introduction, AT sequences are strongly polymorphic. Thus, it is not surprising that we have found a Hoogsteen structure for d(ATATAT) in crystals, whereas our NMR studies show a Watson-Crick structure in solution. We cannot exclude that the use of other solvents might allow us to detect the Hoogsteen conformation in solution. We should note that the structures we have described in this paper are the only ones available for oligonucleotides that are 100% A,T and contain six or more bases. Longer oligonucleotides that contain A,T sequences have been studied, but their crystal structure is strongly influenced by the presence of guanine bases at the ends of the oligonucleotides which present characteristic intermolecular interactions (39). Hoogsteen DNA in Protein/DNA Complexes. There are very few protein/DNA complexes that have been studied by X-ray crystallography and contain stretches of A,T base pairs. In a detailed study (20) of TATA-box binding proteins,

The intensity of the intraresidual NOE contacts between H1 and the H8 of the adenines, and between H1 and H6 of the thymines are very similar, indicating that all glycosidic angles are mainly in an anti conformation. Other experimental distances, like sequential H6/H8 or H8-methyl are

4098 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 14, 2004 all A,T base pairs show standard Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds, even when an alternating (TA)3 sequence is embedded in the oligonucleotide. In some repressor-operator complexes an oligonucleotide sequence containing (AT)4 was used (40, 41). Unfortunately, the resolution was limited (3.2 Å), and the bases were not well resolved. Another feature of interest is the eventual presence of Hoogsteen base pairs embedded in oligonucleotides with mixed sequence. Given the comparatively low resolution attained in many DNA/ protein complexes, it is possible that eventual Hoogsteen base pairs may have not been detected. Only recently (21), a Hoogsteen base pair has been found embedded in an undistorted B-DNA. Surprisingly, the adenine in the syn conformation has no direct interactions with the protein side chains, although the oligonucleotide is constrained by two R-helices of the protein which have many contacts with neighbor base pairs. This observation indicates that transition to a Hoogsteen conformation does not imply a large energetic penalty for a DNA duplex, as confirmed by theoretical studies (2). On the other hand, the presence of Hoogsteen base pairs will have a strong influence on protein/DNA recognition, given the strong change of properties of both grooves in the duplex. Hoogsteen pairing has also been detected in some C,G base pairs (20). Formation of such base pairs requires protonation of cytosine. One of the hydrogen bonds between the bases is absent, whereas a hydrogen bond between the N2 atom of guanine and one phosphate oxygen is formed, so that on the whole no hydrogen bond is lost. In this case, the formation of one of the Hoogsteen base pairs is clearly stabilized by hydrophobic interaction of the protein with the minor groove of the oligonucleotide. These results (20) indicate that C,G base pairs could also be present in Hoogsteen DNA duplexes. In fact, it has been found (42) that poly(dCG) at moderate low pH may show a transition to a Hoogsteen form. The pH at which the transition occurs depends on the ionic strength of the buffer used. Interactions that FaVor Hoogsteen DNA. We may wonder why we have obtained a Hoogsteen DNA conformation in the crystals we have described. The structure is independent from the packing arrangement, since it has been found in two different crystalline forms. In both cases, a hydrophobic environment is created in the minor groove which could explain the presence of extrahelical bases (Figures 3 and 4). In fact, isolated base pairs in Hoogsteen conformation (20, 21) are also found in a hydrophobic environment. In some hairpin loops studied by NMR, a thymine base was also present in the minor groove of Hoogsteen A,T pairs (14, 16). Thus, we may expect that Hoogsteen DNA may be found in protein/DNA complexes in which the protein provides a hydrophobic environment for the DNA minor groove. Another related feature of our crystallization trials is that under many conditions liquid crystals were observed (unpublished results). AT-rich oligonucleotides in the B-form will have a spine of hydration in the minor groove and may form highly hydrated unstable crystals. The crystals we have obtained at a relatively high precipitant concentration (37% MPD) and low temperature (13°) may represent a less soluble, more stable crystal structure. What is obvious from our crystallographic study is that Hoogsteen base pairing is not isolated to a single base pair. Thus, the formation of an

antiparallel duplex with all base pairs in Hoogsteen conformation is an accessible state for DNA. Nevertheless, no safe conclusions can be derived from the crystallization conditions used in each particular case. It is well-known that A- and B-form crystals are obtained under very similar conditions: the particular form obtained (either A or B) is mainly determined by the length and sequence of the oligonucleotide that is used. An interesting case is the CCCG tetraloop which closes an oligonucleotide hairpin (15). In that case, a transition of a C,G base pair from Watson-Crick to Hoogsteen is detected by a moderate change in pH. It is the only example we have found that shows such a transition of a single base pair in the same DNA structure. This example demonstrates that such changes are possible and might be found in other situations. The Potential Role of Hoogsteen DNA in the Cell Nucleus. Thus far there is no evidence that Hoogsteen DNA may occur "in vivo". However, there are a number of chromatin functions which are poorly understood in which Hoogsteen DNA may play a role, and we will briefly review them. We will emphasize those cases in which an unknown structure for AT-rich sequences has been suggested. Such sequences are common in many organisms (Table 5). For example, the scaffold-associated regions (SARs, also called MARs) are highly AT-rich regions of the genome (43-45). Specific proteins are apparently found in those regions, but the structure of their complexes with DNA is unknown. Centromere DNAs always have AT-rich regions (46). They are usually embedded in longer heterochromatic regions, also AT-rich. In particular, yeast centromeres have a central CDEII element about 85-bp long and 93% AT (47). Drosophila centromeres contain long (AATAT) repeats, accompanied by other types of sequences (48). In Arabidopsis (49, 50) and human R-satellite (51) the centromeric sequences are more complex, but are always enriched in AT base pairs. Nevertheless, it is not clear which features of centromere DNA determine its unique function (52). It appears that a high percentage of AT and some undetermined features of sequence are required for function. An alternative view is that only specific proteins are required for centromere function; DNA sequence does not play a role (53). In fact, DNA sequence and protein structure may have evolved together in centromeres (54). The arguments in favor of such contrasting views have been recently reviewed by Lamb and Birchler (55). There are many other DNA and chromatin features that involve AT-rich regions in which Hoogsteen DNA might play a role, such as simple sequence repeats (56), replication

FIGURE 9: Comparison of Watson-Crick (WC) (top) and Hoogsteen (bottom) base pairs in duplex conformation. In the picture, the minor groove is facing downward. The position of the helical axis in each case is indicated by a star. Hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are indicated by arrows. Note that the minor groove is narrower in the Hoogsteen case and has lost a hydrogen bond acceptor atom. The major groove has a similar appearance, but in the Hoogsteen case an additional external N3 atom is present. It is placed close to the phosphodiester backbone and may form water bridges with a phosphate group. An example is apparent in Figure 7. Such bridges contribute to the stability of the Hoogsteen base pair. The conformation of the glycosidic angle is syn in the Hoogsteen adenine base and anti in all other cases.

origins (57, 58), fragile site genesis (59), bending (60), HMG interaction sites (61), etc. Unusual structures present in repeated DNA may trigger gene silencing (62). TATA boxes may become silent and not recognized by TATA-box binding proteins (TBPs) when found in the Hoogsteen conformation. We should also note that the biological role of satellite repeats remains unknown (63); many of them are AT-rich (64), with the extreme case of some crab DNAs which contain over 90% of an alternating AT sequence (65). CONCLUSION A summary of the differences between B-form and Hoogsteen DNA is presented in Figure 9. Hoogsteen DNA provides a strong structural message: hydrogen bonding is altered, the minor groove changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Its stability is similar to B-form DNA, although it may be more rigid (2). It is an optimal target for proteins to recognize AT-rich regions. New approaches are required to determine under what conditions this unexpected conformation of the double helix plays a role in the cell, which may have gone undetected so far. In particular, further highresolution studies of AT-rich DNA and its protein complexes by NMR, X-ray crystallography and other methods should be undertaken.
