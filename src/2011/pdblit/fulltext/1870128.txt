Background: Nitrile hydratases are unusual metalloenzymes that catalyze the hydration of nitriles to their corresponding amides. They are used as biocatalysts in acrylamide production, one of the few commercial scale bioprocesses, as well as in environmental remediation for the removal of nitriles from waste streams. Nitrile hydratases are composed of two subunits, and , and they contain one iron atom per unit. We have determined the crystal structure of photoactivated iron-containing nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus sp. R312 to 2.65 Å resolution as a first step in the elucidation of its catalytic mechanism. Results: The subunit consists of a long N-terminal arm and a C-terminal domain that forms a novel fold. This fold can be described as a four layered structure, - - - , with unusual connectivities between the strands. The subunit also contains a long N-terminal extension, a helical domain, and a C-terminal domain that folds into a roll. The two subunits form a tight heterodimer that is the functional unit of the enzyme. The active site is located in a cavity at the subunit­subunit interface. The iron centre is formed by residues from the subunit only -- three cysteine thiolates and two mainchain amide nitrogen atoms are ligands. Conclusions: Nitrile hydratases contain a novel iron centre with a structure not previously observed in proteins; it resembles a hybrid of the iron centres of heme and Fe­S proteins. The low-spin electronic configuration presumably results in part from two Fe­amide nitrogen bonds. The structure is consistent with the metal ion having a role as a Lewis acid in the catalytic reaction.

Introduction
Nitrile hydratases (NHases, EC 4.2.1.84) are non-heme iron-containing or non-corrinoid cobalt-containing enzymes that catalyze the hydration of nitriles to their corresponding amides. They have considerable practical importance as biocatalysts -- a member of this class of enzymes is presently being used in a 30 000 ton yr­1 acrylamide production process [1] and are used for environmental remediation -- nitrile hydratases have been shown to be effective in the removal of nitriles from waste streams [2]. Fascinatingly, one subset of the iron-containing NHases is activated by light in a reaction involving photodetachment of nitric oxide from an endogenous Fe­NO unit [3]. These enzymes comprise two subunits, and , not related in amino acid sequence, each with a molecular mass around 23 kDa [4]. These iron-containing enzymes have one iron ion per unit, most probably bound to the subunit [5]. Various spectroscopic methods have been applied to deduce the coordination of the NHase iron centre. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements [6,7] showed the iron to be the only example of a mononuclear

non-heme low-spin ferric ion in a protein. On the basis of EPR [6,7], ENDOR [8,9], EXAFS [10,11] and resonance Raman [10,12] spectroscopy measurements the iron ion in the activated enzyme was suggested to have a pseudooctahedral N3S2O ligand field, the first example of a mixed NSO ligand field for a non-heme iron site. In this communication, we describe the crystal structure of the photoactivated nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus sp. R312 at 2.65 Å resolution. Analysis of this structure reveals both a novel fold for the subunit and an iron centre not previously seen in proteins. The crystal structure provides a molecular basis for reexamination of the spectroscopic data with respect to the coordination of the iron centre, and is the first step toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of photoactivation and catalysis by this class of enzymes.

The final model of the dimer contains residues 10­207 and one iron ion of the subunit, and all 212 amino acid residues of the subunit. There are four copies of the NHase dimer in an asymmetric crystal unit -- in total 4 × (198 + 212) residues. No electron density that could correspond to a bound butyrate molecule was found. The overall real-space correlation coefficient [13] is 0.84. There is no electron density for the

The subunit

The subunit consists of a long extended N-terminal arm (residues 10­52), containing helices 1A and 2A, and a globular C-terminal domain (Fig. 2a,b). The structure of this globular domain is unusual and is best described as a four layered structure, - - - . The first

layer is composed of helices 3A­ 5A and a C-terminal region with one short helix, 9A. The two layers are each composed of a two-stranded parallel sheet, composed of 1A, 4A and 2A, 3A, respectively, with unusual connectivities. Strands 1A and 2A form a V-shaped structure intertwined with a corresponding V-shape structure from 3A and 4A -- at a quick glance this looks like a knot in the chain. The final layer of the globular domain is composed of helices 6A­ 8A.
The subunit

roll in NHase is the way in which the C-terminal residues fold back and form a last strand.
Quaternary structure

The chain starts with a long loop of 30 residues that wraps around the subunit in the dimer. Residues 30­112 fold into a helical domain consisting of five helices and this domain packs with helices 1A and 2A from the chain. Following this helical domain, the C-terminal part of the chain forms a domain consisting of a roll and one very short helix (Fig. 2a,c). The roll contains six antiparallel strands, of which two are actually continuous; the first strands five have a topology formally similar to the roll in the `histone-like' SSO7D protein from Sulfolobus sulfataricus [14]. A peculiar feature of the

The and chains form a tight dimer (Fig. 3), as indicated by the large subunit interface area (3800 Å2) which is buried upon formation of the dimer. The interface area consists of 69% nonpolar, 18% polar and 12% charged residues, which is close to the hydropathy values derived from a survey of oligomeric proteins -- 65% nonpolar, 22% polar and 13% charged residues [15]. At the interface between the two subunits, there is a large open cavity and the metal centre is located in the interior of this cavity bound to the subunit. Several major subunit­subunit interaction areas can be defined. Two of these involve the extended N-terminal arms of the two subunits -- the N-terminal arm from the subunit wraps around the core regions of the subunit and vice versa (Fig. 3). Another extended interface is formed between the N-terminal helices from both subunits, 1A, 2A and helices 1B­ 5B. The third interface

area involves structures of the two subunits, where the two-stranded sheet 2A, 3A is extended by strands from the roll forming a five-stranded sheet. In the crystal of NHase, there is an extensive interface of 1560 Å2 between two heterodimers, which suggests that the quaternary structure of the enzyme might be a tetramer (Fig. 4). The rather conserved part of the N terminus of the chain is involved in this dimer­dimer interface; it is buried right in the centre of the interface. Evidence for the quaternary structure in solution is inconclusive. The molecular mass of the NHase enzyme from Rhodococcus sp. R312 has been reported to be 77 kDa, indicating a trimeric structure [16], but the apparently identical Rhodococcus N-771 enzyme is described as a dimer [17]. The hydropathy of the dimer­dimer interface region (53% hydrophobic, 22% polar and 25% charged residues) deviates considerably from that usually found in subunit­subunit interfaces of oligomeric proteins, and it is more like that found for the solvent-accessible surface of a protein molecule [15]. Thus, in spite of the large interface area between the dimers in the crystal, the dominant species in solution might be the dimer, as observed for the Rhodococcus N-771 enzyme [17]. It is notable that the nitrile hydratase from Pseudomonas putida NRRL 18668, a cobalt-containing enzyme with 49% amino acid sequence identity in the subunit and 39% identity in the subunit to the respective subunits of Rhodococcus sp. N774, apparently exists in a dimer­tetramer equilibrium [18].
The metal centre

closest to the metal centre is Arg56B at 4.3 Å. The iron is bound to a conserved stretch of residues of the loop following strand 2A -- Val109-Cys-Ser(Thr)-Leu-CysSer-Cys115 (Fig. 5) -- a motif previously suggested to supply ligands to the metal ion of NHase [10]. The ligands to the iron ion are the sidechains of Cys110A, Cys113A, Cys115A, and the mainchain amide nitrogens of residues Ser114A and Cys115A (Fig. 6). These five ligands are located at five vertices of an octahedron, with the sixth position unoccupied in the crystal structure. The plane of this octahedron is defined by an 11-atom chelate comprising residues 113­115, including the two peptide nitrogen ligands and the two sulfur ligands of residues 113 and 115. Both these sulfur atoms are held in place by hydrogen bonds to the guanidinium groups of two conserved arginine sidechains, Cys113A S ­Arg141B and Cys115A S ­Arg56B. The sixth position of the octahedron is accessible to the active-site cleft. It has been proposed from 1H and 17O ENDOR resonances that a hydroxide ion occupies this position [9]; conceivably, a water or hydroxide molecule might not be seen at the present resolution of the electron-density maps. This metal centre is highly unusual and has not been seen before in metalloproteins. In fact, this is only the second reported example of peptide amide ligation in a metalloprotein [19]. Note that the EXAFS data [20] suggest that NHase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 contains Co3+ in an identical ligand field. The iron site in NHase resembles a hybrid of the iron centres in heme proteins and Fe­S proteins; the plane of the octahedron is defined by an 11-atom protein chelate that can be superimposed on the plane of the four pyrrole nitrogens and the iron in a heme group (Fig. 7). The axial nature of the ligand field and the strong-field amide nitrogen

The iron centre is located in the central cavity formed at the interface between the and subunits in the dimer. All protein ligands to the metal ion, however, are provided by the subunit; the residue of the subunit

Amino acid sequence alignments of the (a) and (b) subunits of iron- (first four sequences) and cobalt- (other three sequences) dependent NHases. The secondary structure elements of the NHase from Rhodococcus sp. R312 are shown (first line). Conserved residues are indicated by bold-faced letters. NHases are: N774,

Rhodococcus sp. N-774 [30]; ReJ, Rhodococcus erythropolis JCM6823 [38]; Pc, Pseudomonas chlororaphis [39]; Rh, Rhodococcus sp. [40]; Pp, Pseudomonas putida NRRL-18668 [18]; J1l, Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 low molecular weight enzyme; J1h, Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 high molecular weight enzyme [41].

ligands in the plane probably account for the low-spin electronic configuration of the iron. The ligand sphere of NHase as observed in the crystal structure is thus S3N2X. EXAFS studies were consistent with either two or three sulfur ligands [10,11], and observation of three coupled nitrogen nuclei and a coupled oxygen nucleus by ENDOR [8,9] led to the earlier suggestion that the ligand field was S2N3O1. The presence of histidine ligands was inferred from the ENDOR result, but the closest histidine residue to the iron in the crystal structure is 10 Å away. We conclude that two of the nitrogen nuclei identified by the spectroscopic studies are the

mainchain nitrogens of residues Ser114A and Cys115A rather than imidazole nitrogens, but we cannot identify the third weakest 14/15N interaction observed by ENDOR.
The active site and catalytic mechanism

The metal centre, accessible to the bulk solution, is bound at an open cavity that is very probably the active-site pocket of the enzyme. The open form of the pocket puts few restraints on the size of possible substrates, in agreement with the observed broad substrate specificity of NHase [21]. The walls of this cavity are formed by the metal centre and residues Gln91A, Ser114A, Trp118A, Ser114A, Tyr37B, Val52B, Arg56B, Tyr67B, Tyr72B, Arg75B,

Tyr76B and Arg141B. Of these, only the ligands to the metal ion and Arg56B, Tyr72B and Arg141B are strictly conserved among both the cobalt-and iron-dependent NHases (Fig. 5), which is consistent with the significant differences in substrate preferences among the enzymes. A role for the metal in catalysis is not yet proven, but the effects of the addition of substrate [6] or the competitive inhibitors phenylhydrazine [22] and butyric acid [12,23] on the EPR and resonance Raman spectra are strongly suggestive of the involvement of the Fe ion in catalysis. More direct evidence that the active-site location is in the proximity of the metal is the position of the iodine atom of the substrate analogue iodoacetonitrile, one of the heavymetal derivatives used for phase determination. In spite of the medium resolution for this derivative, the difference

Fourier map shows a strong peak corresponding to the iodine atom in the cavity close to the iron centre. The iodine atom forms van der Waals interactions to the sidechains of Val52B, Arg56B and Tyr76B. A model of iodoacetonitrile based on the iodine position can be built into the active site, such that the nitrile nitrogen atom is 2.2 Å from the iron, consistent with coordination of the nitrile to the metal ion replacing the solvent-derived oxygen ligand (Fig. 6). This suggests a Lewis-acid role for the metal ion in activating the nitrile for hydration, as is seen in model studies [24]. Nucleophilic attack on the nitrile carbon by a water molecule held in place, for example by Tyr72B, could then occur (Fig. 8). Alternative mechanisms assume that binding of the substrate occurs in the proximity of a metal-bound water or hydroxide ion, which then either attacks the nitrile carbon, similar to that

Biological implications
Nitrile hydratases (NHases) are enzymes that catalyze the hydration of nitriles to their corresponding amides; they contain a mononuclear non-heme iron or non-corrinoid cobalt ion. NHases are unusual metalloenzymes -- these iron-dependent enzymes provide the only known example of mononuclear non-heme low-spin ferric ions in a protein. These enzymes are composed of two types of subunits, and ; different quaternary structures have been observed for NHase ( dimers or 2 2 tetramers), depending on the species of origin. Determination of the structure of NHase from Rhodococcus sp. R312 reveals a unique fold for the subunits. In this structure, the and subunit form a tight dimer, and the dimer is the minimal functional unit of the enzyme. The active site of the enzyme is located at an open pocket formed at the interface between the two subunits.

proposed for amine hydrolysis by cytidine deaminase [25], or activates a water molecule which in turn can act as a nucleophile (Fig. 8). Finally, mechanisms involving nucleophilic attack by one of the conserved cysteines thiolates followed by hydrolysis of the resulting thioimide [23] seem less likely because all of those residues are coordinated to the metal ion.

Spectroscopic studies indicated that the metal sites in these proteins have novel structures, with an octahedral combination of N, S, and O donor ligands resulting in low-spin Fe3+. The crystal structure analysis now reveals the structure of this unique metal centre. The ferric ion is coordinated by two peptide backbone amide nitrogens as well as three cysteine thiolates, all derived from the subunit. These ligands are arranged at five vertices of an octahedron leaving the sixth ligand position available for exogenous ligands. It is of interest to note that the residues which coordinate to the metal ion are conserved between the iron- and cobalt-dependent nitrile hydratases, suggesting a highly similar metal centre also exists in the cobalt-dependent enzymes. On the basis of the crystal structure of NHase, mechanistic proposals can be made which all suggest that the metal ion has a role as a Lewis acid. One mechanism assumes direct coordination of the substrate nitrile nitrogen to the metal ion, thereby increasing the electrophilicity of the carbon atom and facilitating hydrolysis. Alternately, catalysis proceeds without direct coordination of the substrate to the metal ion and the ferric ion provides a hydroxide group, which can act either as a nucleophile of high power directly attacking the carbon atom of the nitrile or as a general base activating a water molecule at the active site.

Material and methods
Crystallization and data collection
Nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus sp. R312 was purified as described previously [12]. Crystals of the enzyme were grown in daylight from solutions of 10 mg enzyme ml­1 (in 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 40 mM butyrate to stabilize the active form of the enzyme) by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 4°C. Optimal conditions for crystal growth were using 27% PEG 8000 and 0.3 M MgCl2 as precipitants, buffered at pH 8.5 with 0.1 M TRIS. All data sets were collected at 4°C using a MAR-imaging plate mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode, operating at 50 KV and 90 mA. Data frames

Possible catalytic roles for the metal ion in nitrile hydratases, which are consistent with the crystal structure. In all these mechanisms, the metal ion acts as a Lewis acid. Mechanisms (a) and (b) involve ligand exchange. The slow rates for ligand exchange for trivalent metal ions, in particular Co(III), are in favour of mechanism (c) which assumes formation of an outer sphere complex.

Statistics of the data collection are given in Table 1. The determination of the spacegroup and cell dimensions was carried out using the auto-index option in DENZO and by analysis of pseudo-precession images generated with the program Pattern (G Lu, personal communication). The crystals are of spacegroup P212121, with cell dimensions a = 88.8 Å, b = 144.4 Å, c = 159.8 Å. There are four ( ) dimers in the asymmetric unit, giving a VM value of 2.76 Å3 Da­1.

Crystallographic refinement and model validation
The model was refined with X-PLOR [32]. A portion of 3.5% of the reflections were set apart for monitoring Rfree [33] throughout the refinement process. Bond and angle parameters as described by Engh and Huber [34] were used and tight ncs restraints were kept throughout the refinement. A round of simulated annealing reduced the Rfree to 38.8%. After a few rounds of remodelling and positional refinement, a grouped B factor refinement was included. Due to the limited resolution, no attempt was made to model any solvent molecules. The final crystallographic R factor is 26.4% and Rfree is 28.9%. The refined model was analyzed with PROCHECK [35]. The Ramachandran plot showed no residues in disallowed regions. Details of the refinement procedure and the statistics for the final model are given in Table 2. The positions of the heavy-metal sites were confirmed by difference Fourier analysis, using phases calculated from the refined protein model. The mercury ion binds to residue Cys195 of the subunit and the iodine is located in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the sidechains of Trp118A, Tyr37B, Met40B, Val55B, Tyr72B and Tyr76B in the vicinity of the iron centre.

MIR phasing and model building
Heavy-metal derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in a 5 mM solution of the heavy-atom compound in mother liquor for several hours. Two major binding sites were located by manual inspection of the difference Patterson map for the mercury derivative, and two additional sites were located by difference Fourier analysis. The phases from the mercury derivative were used to identify the positions of the iodine atoms in the iodoacetonitrile derivative. Finally, the parameters for all the heavy-metal sites, including the anomalous signal from the mercury derivative were refined with MLPHARE [27], and the derived phases were used to calculate an electron density map. The MIR map was improved by solvent flattening using the program SQUASH [28]. From these maps, a molecular envelope could be derived for an heterodimer using MAMA [29]. The noncrystallographic symmetry (ncs) operators were deduced from the four pairs of mercury and iodine sites with the LSQ option in O [13] and improved with the program IMP [29]. The MIR phases were refined with fourfold ncs averaging using the program RAVE [29]. The quality of the map was significantly improved and the secondary structure elements were recognizable. At this stage, the anomalous signal from the iron ions in the native data was included in the phasing, the mask and the ncs operators were updated and new rounds of fourfold averaging were carried out. The final averaged electron-density map at 2.9 Å resolution (correlation coefficient 0.95, R factor 0.183) had continuous electron density for the and chains and it allowed the assignment of the biological amino acid sequence to the electron density. The complete amino acid sequence for the and chain for NHase from Rhodococcus sp. R312 is not yet known, so we have been using the amino acid sequence for NHase from Rhodococcus N-774 [30]. Rhodococcus sp. R312, formerly Brevibacterium sp. R312, is reported to be identical to Rhodococcus N-774 [5,31].
