dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalyzes the NADH-dependent reversible conversion of pyruvate and ammonia to Lalanine. Expression of the gene coding for this enzyme is up-regulated in the persistent phase of the organism, and alanine dehydrogenase is therefore a potential target for pathogen control by antibacterial compounds. We have determined the crystal structures of the apo- and holo-forms of the enzyme to 2.3 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. The enzyme forms a hexamer of identical subunits, with the NAD-binding domains building up the core of the molecule and the substrate-binding domains located at the apical positions of the hexamer. Coenzyme binding stabilizes a closed conformation where the substrate-binding domains are rotated by about 16° toward the dinucleotide-binding domains, compared to the open structure of the apo-enzyme. In the structure of the abortive ternary complex with NAD+ and pyruvate, the substrates are suitably positioned for hydride transfer between the nicotinamide ring and the C2 carbon atom of the substrate. The approach of the nucleophiles water and ammonia to pyruvate or the reaction intermediate iminopyruvate, respectively, is, however, only possible through conformational changes that make the substrate binding site more accessible. The crystal structures identified the conserved active-site residues His96 and Asp270 as potential acid/base catalysts in the reaction. Amino acid replacements of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis led to inactive mutants, further emphasizing their essential roles in the enzymatic reaction mechanism.

ium tuberculosis, the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis poses a major threat to human health worldwide.2 Treatment of this disease is further complicated by the ability of M. tuberculosis to persist in the lungs of infected individuals for decades by switching to a dormant or latent phase,1 which also induces tolerance to current antibiotics.2,3 About one-third of the world's population are infected with persistent mycobacteria, providing an enormous potential reservoir for further spread of

1162 this disease. Dormancy has been associated with nonreplicating or very slow growth of M. tuberculosis that resides in granulomas, a heterogeneous assembly of macrophages, in the lungs of infected individuals. It is generally assumed that the microenvironment in the granulomas is characterized by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.4­6 Several experimental in vitro models for the dormant phase of the bacilli have been developed, albeit their relevance to human latent infection is still a matter of debate. A widely used in vitro approach to mimic dormancy is based on culture of M. tuberculosis under microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions.7 Other models of dormancy utilize nutrient starvation8 or treatment by nitric oxide.9 Drug-induced persistence has been studied in vitro using stationary M. tuberculosis grown under microaerophilic conditions treated with rifampicin or in vivo by pyrazinamide-induced persistent bacteria in mice.10 These model systems have been employed to study the metabolic state of the bacteria in the dormant phase. Comparison of gene-expression profiles and proteome analyses of active versus nonreplicating bacteria have identified a number of genes that are upregulated in persistent M. tuberculosis.8,11­16 One of these genes, Rv2780, found to be overexpressed under hypoxic14,15 and nutrient starvation8 regimes, encodes L-alanine dehydrogenase (L-AlaDH). Increased levels of this enzyme have been linked to the generation of alanine for peptidoglycan biosynthesis15,17 and the maintenance of the NAD+ pool under conditions when the terminal electron acceptor oxygen becomes limiting.8,15,18 L-AlaDH catalyzes the NADH-dependent conversion of pyruvate and ammonia to L-alanine (Fig. 1) and is involved in microbial carbon and nitrogen metabolism. The mycobacterial enzyme is secreted

into the culture medium and is identical with the 40-kDa antigen that has been identified in culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis.20 In solution, the enzyme forms a hexamer of six identical subunits (predicted molecular mass = 38,988 Da per subunit), 21 as observed for most L-AlaDHs from other species, for instance, Phormidium lapideum,22 Streptomyces phaeochromogenes,23 and Bacillus subtilis.24 The hexameric molecule of L-AlaDH from P. lapideum (PlAlaDH) shows 32-point-group symmetry and is best described as a trimer of dimers.25 Kinetic and mechanistic studies of L-AlaDHs from several species17,19,26­28 showed that the enzyme follows a predominantly ordered mechanism, with NAD+ and NADH binding occurring first in the oxidative deamination and reductive amination direction, respectively. The enzymatic mechanism most likely proceeds through imino acid and carbinolamine intermediates. 19 Crystal structures of binary complexes of PlAlaDH have identified the binding sites of NAD+ and pyruvate.25 The nicotinamide ring in the L-AlaDH­NAD+ binary complex, obtained by soaking crystals of the apo-enzyme with the nucleotide diphosphate, is, however, not in a position suitable for hydride transfer from the nicotinamide group to pyruvate. It has therefore been questioned whether this complex represents the catalytically active species.25 Here, we report the three-dimensional structures of apo- and holo-L-AlaDH from M. tuberculosis (MtAlaDH). The structures reveal a conformational transition in the form of a 16° rotation upon binding of the dinucleotide, from an "open" to a "closed" conformation. This conformational change ensures proper orientation of the substrates for hydride transfer to occur and excludes bulk water from the active site. The crystal structures and complementary site-directed mutagenesis studies support a

Fig. 1. Proposed catalytic steps for the conversion of pyruvate and ammonia to L-alanine, catalyzed by AlaDH, adapted from Ref. 19. X and Y are two groups on the enzyme that may act as acid/base catalysts. The identity of these groups is discussed in the text. It is likely that the attack of ammonia occurs from the opposite side of the substrate than the attack of the water molecule in the reverse reaction. The stereochemistry of the carbinolamine intermediate is not yet resolved, and the approach of ammonia can, therefore, in principle, occur from above the plane of the paper (as drawn here) or below the plane of the paper. The nicotinamide ring is below the substrate, and hydride transfer results in the formation of L-alanine.

1163 the building block of the hexamer. This interface region is located far from the active site (Fig. 2b) and buries a surface of more than 1700 Å2. Most of the interactions between residues involved in this interface are hydrophobic but include one salt bridge and 10 hydrogen bonds. The "trimer interface" is smaller and buries about 1100 Å2, with the majority of the interactions almost exclusively between the NAD domains from adjacent dimers. These interactions involve two salt bridges (Asp208­Arg139/Arg185 and Arg205­ Glu135), 12 hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. The trimer interface also includes interactions through residues from loop 163­166 and -strand 215­219 with their symmetry-related counterparts from an adjacent NAD domain. The substrate-binding domain contributes much less to the trimer interface and interacts exclusively with the NAD domain of the adjacent dimer through hydrophobic interactions between residues Pro20 and Ala21 that pack against the side chain of Tyr223. There are no direct interactions between adjacent substrate-binding domains in the hexamer. The structure of holo-MtAlaDH reveals a conformational transition upon dinucleotide binding MtAlaDH binds NADH rather strongly, with a Kd of 8.2 M determined from the concentration dependence of the change in fluorescence emission at 390 nm of NADH upon binding to the enzyme (Fig. 3a). A similar value, 10.7 M, is obtained for the Km of NADH in the reductive amination reaction (Fig. 3b). Crystallization of MtAlaDH in the presence of saturating concentrations of NADH resulted in a crystal form different from that of the apo-enzyme, space group P213, and the structure of the holoenzyme was therefore determined by molecular replacement to 2.0 Å resolution (Fig. 3c; Table 1). The major structural difference between apo- and holo-MtAlaDH is a shift in the relative orientation of the two domains upon binding of NADH (Fig. 4). This conformational change can be described by a rigid-body rotation of the substrate-binding domain by approximately 16° around an arbitrary axis toward the NAD domain, resulting in maximum displacements of main-chain carbon atoms in loop 357­360 by 11 Å from their position in the apoenzyme. Two helices, 5 (residues 126­133) and 7 (residues 304­320), act as hinge region for the domain movement, determined by the program DynDom.31 The fact that the domain movement can be described as a closure of the substrate-binding domain toward the NAD domain and not vice versa is suggested by the analysis of the hexamer packing in apo- and holo-MtAlaDH. The core of the hexamer, as well as the composition and size of the interfaces involving the NAD domains, is identical in both molecules, indicating that the packing and orientation of the NAD domains in the hexamer is not changed upon binding of NADH. The domain contacts involving the substrate-binding domains

mechanistic model where conformational changes are required to allow access of water and ammonia to the active site and where the active-site residues His96 and Asp270 participate in proton transfer steps during catalysis.

Results and Discussion
Subunit structure The subunit of L-AlaDH is built up of two distinct domains, the substrate-binding domain (residues 1­ 128 and 309­371) and the NAD-binding domain (residues 129­308), connected by two -helices (Fig. 2a). Both domains contain variants of the classical dinucleotide binding fold common to NAD-dependent dehydrogenases.29 The NAD-binding domain is characterized by a central seven-stranded mixed -sheet flanked by -helices, with one of the edge strands being antiparallel with the rest of the sheet. The core of the substrate-binding domain folds into an eight-stranded -sheet, containing a six-stranded parallel Rossmann fold, extended by a -hairpin motif at one side. The two domains are structurally similar to each other (r.m.s.d. = 2.4 Å, for 82 equivalent C atoms), although there is no detectable sequence similarity. The domains are packed such that the C-terminal ends of the -sheets face each other across a cleft that contains the active site (Fig. 2a). Residues from both domains thus contribute to active-site topology and also provide catalytic groups. Quaternary structure Gel filtration experiments suggested that MtAlaDH forms a hexamer in solution. The structure of MtAlaDH has been determined in three different crystal forms (Table 1), which all contain a hexameric molecule, consistent with the solution data. In crystal form P21212, the asymmetric unit contains a hexamer of 32 symmetry, with a 3-fold noncrystallographic axis coinciding with the molecular 3-fold axis. In space groups P321 and P213, which both contain a dimer in the asymmetric unit, the hexamer is generated by crystallographic 3-fold axes. The quaternary structure is best described as a trimer of dimers (Fig. 2b and c), with the core of the molecule formed by the six NAD-binding domains and the substrate-binding domains located at the apical positions of the hexamer (Fig. 2c). This packing of the subunits in the hexamer generates two major interfaces, the "dimer" interface between two subunits from the upper and lower layers of the hexamer and the "trimer" interface between adjacent "dimers" in the hexamer. In the following, these interfaces are described as observed in the structure of the apo-enzyme. The "dimer interface" formed by the NAD domains (Fig. 2b) includes the most extensive interactions and is responsible for the AlaDH dimer being

1164 are, however, different in the two structures, resulting in a moderate decrease of the size of the trimer interface from 1100 to 970 Å and loss of the interaction between Tyr223 of the NAD domain and the loop from the substrate-binding domain of the neighboring dimer in the holo-enzyme. Several segments of the polypeptide chain that were without interpretable electron density in the apo-enyzme are well ordered in the structure of the binary complex. These regions include two loop regions (residues 241­253 and 267­293) that participate in the binding of NADH. The shift of the substrate-binding domain toward the NAD domain in the holo-enzyme results overall in a more closed conformation of the active site and, in particular, in changes in the position of several putative active-site residues, which are closer to NADH in holo-MtAlaDH. This suggests that the closed conformation reflects a catalytically relevant state of the enzyme, whereas in the open form, the substrates and catalytic groups are not properly

positioned for catalysis. The crystal structure of apoMtAlaDH is similar to the structures of AlaDH from P. lapideum25 and Thermos thermophilus [RIKEN Structural Genomics Initiative, Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code: 2EEZ]. Superposition results in r.m.s.d.'s of 1.0 Å (334 equivalent C atoms) for PlAlaDH (PDB code: 1PJB) and 0.9 Å (337 equivalent C atoms) for TtAlaDH (PDB code: 2EEZ). These crystal structures of the homologues represent the open form of the enzyme and, thus, do not reveal all features of the active enzyme. NAD binding In the electron density maps of the holo-enzyme, well-defined electron density at the expected dinucleotide binding site was observed, which allowed a straightforward fit of NADH to the electron density (Fig. 3c). The dinucleotide is bound in an extended conformation, with the ribose sugar rings in C2 endo conformation. As in other enzymes of the

NAD dehydrogenase family, the dinucleotide is bound to MtAlaDH at the C-terminal end of the sheet, with the diphosphate group positioned at the crossover connection between strands 3 and 4.32 The adenine ring of NADH interacts with the enzyme mainly via hydrophobic interactions with residues Ile199, Val239, Leu240, and Leu249. Similar to PlAlaDH, there are hydrogen bonds between the 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose and a conserved acidic residue, Asp198. An additional hydrogen bond is formed between the 2-hydroxyl of NAD and the -nitrogen atom of Lys203. The pyrophosphate moiety makes a number of contacts through hydrogen bonds to main-chain atoms of the loop 178­179 and to the side chain of Ser134. The hydroxyl groups of the nicotinamide ribose form a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group of Asp270. The nicotinamide ring is bound in a pocket formed by residues Met133, Ser134, Ala137, Ile267, Asp270, and Met301. Hydrogen bonds are formed from backbone atoms of Ile267, Val298, and Met301 to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the carboxamide group of the nicotinamide ring, which position this group such that the 4-pro-R hydrogen points toward the active-site pocket. This binding mode of the nicotinamide ring is consistent with the classification of AlaDH as a class A (pro-R) NADdependent dehydrogenase.33 Crystallization of MtAlaDH at lower concentrations of the dinucleotide, 0.5­1 mM, resulted in a hybrid hexamer, where only the subunits from one dimer were in the closed conformation and the four

remaining subunits remained in the open conformation. While the subunits in the closed conformation contained NADH at full occupancies, the remaining four subunits did not contain NADH or contained NADH only at low occupancies. However, soaking of these crystals (space group P21212) in 10 mM NADH led to full occupancies of all six binding sites, without triggering the conformational change in the open subunits, most likely due to crystal packing interactions. The interactions of NADH with MtAlaDH are identical in the open and closed conformation. The position of the dinucleotide bound to the open form of MtAlaDH is similar to that seen in the complex of PlAlaDH with NAD+.25 There are, however, differences in interactions of the dinucleotide with the enzyme. The most significant is the lack of the bifurcal hydrogen bond of the side chain of Asp270 to the nicotinamide ribose in PlAlaDH. The side chain of the corresponding aspartic acid residue in PlAlaDH (Asp269) points away from the ribose moiety into the solvent. Structure of a ternary complex of MtAlaDH with NAD+ and pyruvate In attempts to obtain structural information on ternary complexes of the enzyme with substrates, cocrystallization experiments of MtAlaDH as abortive ternary complexes with NADH/alanine and NAD+/pyruvate/NH3 were carried out. While the combination enzyme­NADH­alanine was unsuccessful, crystals obtained in the presence of 10 mM

NAD+, 10 mM NH3, and 30 mM pyruvate were similar in shape to those of the holo-enzyme but did not diffract X-rays. However, MtAlaDH cocrystallized with lower concentrations of the substrates (0.5 mM NAD+, 10 mM NH3, and 5 mM pyruvate) gave orthorhombic crystals (space group P21212) that diffracted to 2 Å resolution. These crystals also contain a mixed hexamer with two closed and four open subunits in the asymmetric unit, as described above, and only the subunits in the closed conformation contain bound ligands. The electron density for the bound NAD+ is well defined. The binding mode of NAD+ in the ternary complex is identical with that observed in the holoenzyme obtained with NADH, and all enzyme­ dinucleotide interactions are maintained. Additional difference electron density in the active-site pockets indicated the presence of a bound ligand that was modeled as formate, the precipitating agent used in crystallization (Fig. 5). Residual difference electron density maps after refinement, however, suggested

that this binding site is in part occupied by a larger molecule (Fig. 5a). Modeling of this difference density by pyruvate and subsequent refinement revealed that the occupancy is lower than 1.0 (Fig. 5b), and the crystals contain a mixture of the enzyme/NAD+/ pyruvate and enzyme/NAD+/formate complexes. The carboxyl group of pyruvate binds at the bottom of the cleft between the two domains and is tightly anchored to the enzyme through hydrogen bonds and charge interactions via its oxygen atoms to the side chains of Arg15 and Lys75 (Fig. 5). Lys75 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen of pyruvate, and the side chain of His96 also forms a hydrogen bond to the pyruvate carbonyl oxygen atom. Additional nonpolar interactions are formed to residues Phe94, Leu130, Met133, and Ala299. Most of these enzyme­substrate interactions are also found in the open form of the enzyme,25 but there are two significant differences. As a result of the rigid-body movement of the substrate-binding domain toward the NAD domain, pyruvate is lo-

cated closer to the coenzyme, with a distance of 3 Å between the C4 carbon atom of the nicotinamide ring and the C2 carbon atom of pyruvate (Fig. 6). The latter is stacked against the nicotinamide ring of NAD, in a position suitable for hydride transfer. In addition, the side chain of Asp270 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen atom of pyruvate (Figs. 5 and 6). Site-directed mutagenesis The crystal structures described here identified the conserved residues His96 and Asp270 as putative catalytic groups, and the function of these groups in catalysis was therefore probed by site-directed mutagenesis (Table 2). Replacement of Asp270 by alanine or asparagine, respectively, resulted in completely inactive mutants that did not allow a more detailed kinetic analysis. The comparison of the crystal structures of the Asp270Asn mutant and wild-type MtAlaDH showed that the bifurcated hydrogen bond between Asp270 and the ribose of NAD is replaced by a single hydrogen bond. There are no other differences in the positions of active-site residues or the bound cosubstrate NADH, thus excluding structural defects as the major cause for the catalytic deficiency of this mutant. The amino acid replacement at position His96 also resulted in an enzyme variant with no detectable catalytic activity. Implications for the catalytic mechanism Based on a detailed kinetic analysis of AlaDH from B. subtilis, it was proposed that the enzymatic reaction follows a predominantly ordered mechanism and proceeds through iminopyruvate and carbinolamine intermediates.19,27 The first step in the

reductive amination reaction (Fig. 1) is the binding of NADH, which, as shown in this study, stabilizes a closed conformation where the substrate-binding domain moved toward the NADH-binding domain. In the ternary complex, pyruvate is anchored to the active site through interactions with the side chains of Arg15 and Lys75. The hydrogen bond to Lys75 may further polarize the carbonyl oxygen atom, thus facilitating nucleophilic attack of ammonia on the carbonyl carbon atom, resulting in a carbinolamine intermediate. Protonation of the hydroxyl group and subsequent release of water yield the protonated iminopyruvate, which is reduced to Lalanine. In the ternary complex MtAlaDH­NAD+­ pyruvate (Figs. 5 and 6), the distance between the C4 of the nicotinamide ring and the C carbon atom of pyruvate and, by analogy, of iminopyruvate is 3 Å, suitable for direct hydride transfer. The closed conformation further ensures a hydrophobic environment that favors hydride transfer reactions. We therefore conclude that the structure of the enzyme observed in the ternary complex represents the conformation relevant for the hydride transfer step in the mechanism. It is particularly noteworthy that pyruvate is packed tightly against the nicotinamide ring and is inaccessible to the solvent. There are no bound water molecules observed in the immediate vicinity of the substrate that might indicate binding sites for the nucleophiles (water and ammonia) in the reaction. Grimshaw et al.19 suggested that the attack on the iminopyruvate by the water molecule (i.e., direction of oxidative deamination) occurs from the same site as the nicotinamide ring, that is, on the re face of pyruvate, whereas the attack of ammonia onto pyruvate (i.e., in the direction of reductive amination) occurs from the opposite face. Since the stereochemistry of the resulting carbinolamine intermediate is not yet unambiguously established experimentally, the direction of attack of the two nucleophiles could be reversed, resulting in a carbinolamine with Lhydroxy and D-amino groups. The tight packing of pyruvate (and, by analogy, iminopyruvate) against the nicotinamide ring in the model of the abortive ternary complex enzyme­NAD+­pyruvate is however not consistent with an attack by the water molecule (or ammonia for that matter) on the re face of the intermediate. In order to make pyruvate and iminopyruvate accessible, the enzyme must adopt a

1170 more open conformation at these stages of catalysis in order to allow approach of water and ammonia from the bulk solution, as has been suggested for glutamate dehydrogenase.34 The extent of the required conformational changes is not necessarily very large. For instance, the si face of pyruvate can be made accessible through a rearrangement of the side chain of Lys75, which, in the closed structure, blocks access to pyruvate. A movement toward the adjacent side chain of Glu76 opens a narrow channel from the bulk solution to the bound pyruvate that would allow diffusion of ammonia into the active site (Fig. 7). It is, however, not as obvious how the re face of pyruvate could be made accessible other than through a partial or complete domain rotation toward the conformation seen in the apo-enzyme. Factors that might trigger these and other conformational transitions could be the displacement of the positive charge from NAD+ via the iminonitrogen atom to the participating enzymic residue(s) (Fig. 1) during catalysis, as well as the changes in hybridization of the C carbon of 3 2 L-alanine from sp to sp . A more detailed description of the nature of these structural rearrangements, however, has to await further studies of ternary and quaternary complexes of holo-MtAlaDH with L-alanine and pyruvate/NH3. Several catalytic steps involve proton transfer reactions (Fig. 1). Two conserved residues, His96 and Asp270, are suitably positioned at a distance of 3 Å to the pyruvate carbonyl oxygen atom and, therefore, are potential acid/base catalysts in the reaction. Asp270 was exchanged to alanine and asparagine, and His96 to alanine, respectively, by sitedirected mutagenesis to further investigate the role of these residues in catalysis. Amino acid replacements at these positions led to completely inactive mutant enzymes, and the mutagenesis data thus support critical roles of these conserved residues, possibly as acid/bases in catalysis by MtAlaDH. It is at present, however, not yet clear whether these two residues act in concert (i.e., as a proton relay system) for both proton transfer steps or if they participate individually at different stages of catalysis, for instance, that Asp270 protonates the water molecule after nucleophilic attack and His96 abstracts a proton from the amino group of the carbinolamine or vice versa (Fig. 1). In conclusion, the structure analysis of apo- and holo-alanine dehydrogenase from M. tuberculosis has revealed two conformations of the enzyme. The conformation observed in the presence of the coenzymes NAD+ and NADH, respectively, is characterized by (i) domain closure leading to an active site inaccessible to solvent molecules and favorable for hydride transfer and (ii) completion of the active site by approach of conserved residues that interact with the substrate and participate in catalysis. Furthermore, the closed conformation ensures proper orientation of the nicotinamide ring and the substrate suitable for hydride transfer. Other steps of the catalytic mechanisms require approach of small nucleophiles such as water and ammonia to the reaction intermediates, which is only possible

Methods
Protein production Wild-type MtAlaDH was produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) containing the Mt ald gene in pET26 (Novagen, UK). The recombinant strain was grown at 30 °C in LB

Crystal Structures of Mycobacterial AlaDH medium containing 50 g/ml kanamycin. Induction was performed in mid-log phase by addition of 1.0 mM IPTG, and bacterial cells were harvested 3 h after induction. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the crude extract was centrifuged at 20,000g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was filtered and applied to Ni-NTA resin. Recombinant protein was eluted from the column using an imidazole gradient. The highly purified protein (more than 98% purity as judged by stained SDS-PAGE gels) was stored in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.7, at 4 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis For site-directed mutagenesis, two complementary primers containing the desired mutation (D270A: 5-ATAGCCATCGCTCAGGGCGGCT-3 and 5-AGCCGCCCTGAGCGATGGCTAT-3; D270N: 5-ATAGCCATCAATCAGGGCGGCT-3 and 5-AGCCGCCCTGATTGATGGCTAT-3; H96A: 5-ACGTTCTTGGCTTTGGCCGCGT-3 and 5-ACGCGGCCAAAGCCAAGAACGT-3), together with cloning primers specific to the 5- and 3-ends of ald (forward: 5-GGGCCCCATATGCGCGTCGGTATTCC-3; reverse: 5-GGGCCCAAGCTTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGGCCAGCACGCTGGCGG-3), respectively, were used for amplification of the two fragments. The template for construction of the mutants was the ald gene without the NdeI restriction site. The purified PCR products were used in a second round of PCR of five cycles, and the resulting two fragments were combined and reamplified in order to obtain the entire mutated gene. Mutants were verified by DNA analysis. Mutated ald was inserted into NdeI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pET26 (Novagen), and the MtAlaDH mutants were produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as described above. Enzyme assays Specific activities of recombinant MtAlaDH were determined using the assay previously described.17 For the determination of the Km value of NADH in the reductive amination direction, MtAlaDH (0.17 g/ml) was assayed at 298 K in 0.1 M NH+/NH3 buffer, pH 7.4, with 20 mM 4 pyruvate in a final reaction volume of 1 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of 25 l NADH of appropriate concentrations (final concentration range, 5­320 M) to the reaction mixture. The rate of the reaction was followed at a wavelength of 340 nm using a Jasco V-650 spectrophotometer. The photometric determination of the kinetic parameters for L-alanine and pyruvate, respectively, was carried out as follows. For the oxidative deamination, the reaction mixture consisted of 25 nM MtAlaDH, 125 mM glycine/KOH (pH 10.2), 1.25 mM NAD+, and variable concentrations of L-alanine (0.1­60 mM). For the reductive amination, the assay consisted of 25 nM MtAlaDH, 1.0 M NH4Cl/NH3, pH 7.4, 0.25 mM NADH, and variable concentrations of pyruvate (3.0­400 M). All measurements were performed at 340 nm with a SAFAS UV mc2 spectrophotometer. The kinetic parameters were derived using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Binding assay of NADH The binding constant of NADH to MtAlaDH was determined by following the change in fluorescence emission at 390 nm as a function of NADH concentration. The data points were fitted to the equation A390 = A390, max

1171
(NADH)/(Kd + (NADH)).30 The fluorescence assays were carried out using a Shimadzu RF-510LC fluorescence spectrophotometer. NADH was excited at 331 nm, and the emission at 390 nm was measured to monitor NADH binding. Measurements were performed with 15 M MtAlaDH in 20 mM NH4Cl/NH3, pH 7.4, with stepwise addition of NADH in the concentration range 1­30 M. Crystallization Crystallization experiments were performed using the vapor-diffusion technique. A protein solution of 6.8 mg/ ml MtAlaDH in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.9, was used throughout the crystallization experiments. Initial screening using commercial sparse matrix crystallization screens gave several hits, which could then be further optimized in 24-well hanging drop plates. Typically, 2-l aliquots of the protein solution were mixed with 2 l reservoir solution and set up against 1 ml well solution. Crystals of apo-MtAlaDH were grown using 0.4 M ammonium hydrogenphosphate as reservoir solution at 293 K. For cocrystallization of holo-MtAlaDH, an enzyme solution containing 10 mM NADH was equilibrated at 277 K for 24 h with a well solution containing 23% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 M sodium acetate, and 0.1 M Bis­ Tris propane, pH 8.2. Streak seeding resulted in welldiffracting crystals of the holo-enzyme. A second crystal form of MtAlaDH in the presence of NADH (1 mM) was obtained at 277 K after 2­3 days equilibration against a well solution containing 13% ethanol, 0.2 M MgCl2, and 0.1 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. These crystals were also used for soaking experiments at higher NADH concentrations (10 mM). A putative ternary complex of MtAlaDH, pyruvate, and NAD+ was obtained at 293 K by cocrystallization of an enzyme solution containing 0.5 mM NAD+ and 5 mM pyruvate using a well solution containing 0.1 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, and 0.45 M Mg(HCO2)2. Cocrystallization of the mutant D270N MtAlaDH with NADH was carried out using the same protocol as for wild-type holo-MtAlaDH. All crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen after transfer for a few seconds into mother liquor containing 30% glycerol. For the soaking experiments, the crystals were left for 10 min in mother liquid containing 30% glycerol and 10 mM NADH before flash freezing. Data collection and structure determination All data were collected in a nitrogen stream at 110 K using synchrotron radiation at MAX-lab, Lund, Sweden, and at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. Images were processed with the program MOSFLM and scaled using the program SCALA from the CCP4 suite.35 The best crystals of the apo-enzyme diffracted to 2.3 Å resolution. Initially, the space group P622 was assigned, but inspection of the intensity distribution clearly indicated merohedral twinning. The CCP4 programs Truncate36 and Detwin37 in combination with analysis of self-rotation function plots calculated with MOLREP38 were used to further analyze crystal twinning. The "Merohedral Crystal Twinning Server"39 was used for the calculation of the twin fraction. The twin tests suggested hemihedral twinning, with the true space group being P321 and an estimated twin fraction of 0.3. Molecular replacement was performed using the twinned data and the program Phaser40 with PlAlaDH (PDB code: 1PJC) as search model. Two molecules per asymmetric unit were found. The structure of apo

1172
MtAlaDH was refined to 2.3 Å with a fixed twin fraction of 0.3 using the protocol for data with hemihedral twinning in CNS.41 A test set was excluded to monitor Rfree. Care was taken not to bias the refinement, and twin-related reflections were kept together in either the test or work set. Refinement with simulated annealing, individual B-factors, and energy minimization procedures was alternated with model building in Coot.42 Initially, noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied but were removed in later stages of the refinement. Water molecules were added automatically in Coot and inspected manually. Electron density for several disordered loop regions (subunit A: residues 240­258, 269­293, and 298­300; subunit B: residues 240­254, 268­293, and 297­300) was missing or very weak, and these residues were therefore not included in the final model. Details of model statistics after refinement are given in Table 1. Crystals of MtAlaDH obtained in the presence of pyruvate and NAD+ belong to the space group P21212, with a hexamer in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP38 using one subunit of the refined apo-enzyme as search model. In the first run, four of the subunits were positioned. The remaining NAD-binding domains were placed in a second run using only this domain as a search model. The substrate domains of these two subunits were then manually placed in the electron density, followed by rigid-body refinement with the individual domains as separate rigid bodies. After rigid-body refinement, NADH was manually fitted in the residual electron density using the program Coot.42 The crystals obtained in the presence of 10 mM NADH belong to the cubic space group P213 with one dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure was phased using the refined closed monomer of MtAlaDH (NADH excluded from the model) as search model in MOLREP.38 Refinement of the structures of the binary and ternary complexes followed similar protocols. Rounds of refinement with REFMAC543 were interspersed with manual model building in Coot. Atomic displacement parameters were refined in REFMAC by the TLS method,44 with each domain of the monomers treated as a single TLS group. Bound ligands were placed manually in the electron density, and water molecules were added automatically and inspected manually. The NAD molecules bound to the subunits in the closed conformation of the enzyme showed full occupancies, while in some of the subunits in the open conformation, NAD was modeled at occupancies of 0.5. Refinement of the MtAlaDH D270N mutant holo-enzyme was performed in a similar way as for the wild-type protein. The structure was determined using the closed holo-enzyme as a search model in MOLREP,38 followed by rounds of refinement with REFMAC5,43 which were interspersed with manual model building in Coot.42 The final models were validated with PROCHECK.45 Structural comparisons were carried out using SSM.46 All figures visualizing protein models were prepared using PyMOL. Protein­protein interfaces were analyzed with the program AREAIMOL47 using a probe radius of 1.4 Å.
