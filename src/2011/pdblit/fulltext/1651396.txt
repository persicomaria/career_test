Abstract
Electronic ground nature of ferric cytochromes c' isolated from five photosynthetic bacteria, Chromatium t,inosum ATCC 17899, Rhodobacter capsulatus ATCC 11166, Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001, Rhodospirillum molischianum ATCC 14031, and Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170 has been investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR spectra indicate that the electronic ground state of five ferric cytochromes c' is a quantum mechanical admixed-spin state of a high spin (S = 5 / 2 ) and an intermediate spin (S = 3 / 2 ) at pH 7.2 and is high-spin state at pH 11.0. At physiological pH, however, the content of an intermediate spin state differs with the bacterial source of the protein: = 50%, Chromatium vinosum; = 40%, Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodopseudomonas palustris; = 10%, Rhodospirillum molischianum and Rhodospirillum rubrum. Computer simulation of the spectra supports this diversity of the contribution of an intermediate spin state. Model studies of the ferric porphyrin complexes suggest that the correlation between content of an intermediate spin state and heme iron displacement from the mean heme plane. Therefore, the variation of the content of an intermediate spin state observed in the present study reflects the subtle difference in the degree of heme iron displacement among the proteins.

1. Introduction

Cytochromes c' are c-type heme proteins found in purple photosynthetic [1], denitrifying [2], nitrogen-fixing [3], and sulfur-oxidizing [4] bacteria. Although their physiological function has not been precisely established, it has been suggested that the protein functions in bacterial

electron transfer in the cell. Recent studies of cytochrome c' in denitrifying bacteria reported that cytochrome c' may suppress NO concentration in the cells by trapping NO [5,6]. In general, cytochrome c' is isolated as a dimer of identical subunit, M r ~ 14000, each has a protoheme IX prosthetic group covalently bound to polypeptide chain via thioether linkages near the C-terminus in contrast to the common cytochrome c of which protoheme IX binds near the N-terminus. Amino acid sequences of cytochromes c' from 12 bacterial species [7] indicate the sequence homology near the C-terminus of the polypeptide incorporating the heme binding site. Therefore, it seems probable that the heme environments of the cytochrome c' quite resemble each other. Certainly, the X-ray studies of three ferric cytochrome c' isolated from Rhodospirillum molischianum [8,9], Rhodospirillum rubrum [10], and Chromatium vinosum [11] have confirmed the structural similarity be-

tween them. The heme iron is five-coordinated with a solvent-exposed histidine residue as the fifth ligand. The vacant sixth ligand position is closely packed by aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues called narrow 'cage' [12]. These structural features of the cytochrome c' are quite different from those of the mitochondorial c-type cytochromes. It has been noted that the cytochrome c' has unique magnetic, spectroscopic, and ligand binding properties [ 13]. The absence of a sixth ligand is a common feature of high-spin heme proteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin. However, ligand binding properties of the cytochrome c' differ from those of typical high-spin heme proteins. Moreover, the spin state for the ferric cytochrome c' has been the subject of controversy. Initially, optical [ 14], magnetic susceptibility [ 15,16], and near-infrared [ 17] studies suggested that cytochrome c' is substantially high spin at physiological pH. On the other hand, based on the anomalies in EPR spectra of the ferric cytochrome c', Maltempo and coworkers proposed that the electronic ground state of the ferric cytochrome c' from C. ~,inosum in the neutral pH range is present in a quantum mechanical admixture of a high-spin (S = 5 / 2 ; 6A j) and an intermediate spin (S = 3/2; 4A 2) state [18,19]. MiSssbauer study of C. vinosum cytochrome c' supported the quantum mixedspin state [20]. Resonance Raman data also suggested the existence of intermediate spin state of the ferric cytochrome c' from Rhodopseudomonas palustris [21 ]. Later M/issbauer [22] and near-infrared MCD [23] studies preferred the high-spin configuration. NMR studies [24-30] also favored the high-spin state at neutral pH. However, in the case of C. L, inosum cytochrome c', La Mar et al. [25] suggested the ground state anomaly based on the observations of the weakly upfield-shifted meso-H peaks, which is consistent with the intermediate spin character but not proof for it. It is reported in recent EPR studies of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c' that the protein has quantum mixed-spin both in the isolated state (pH 6.1) and in intact cells [31]. In fact, quantum mechanically admixed-spin state is so unusual that there are few reports which suggest the existence of an admixed intermediate spin state in other native protein. Only horseradish peroxidase exhibits the distinctive EPR spectrum derived from a quantum mixedspin state [32,33]. We have investigated the electronic structures of the cytochromes c' from five chemoheterotrophic bacteria such as Achromobacter xylosoxidans (formerly, Alcaligenes sp.) NCIB 11015 and A. xylosoxidans GIFU 543 [34] and from a photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodobacter capsulatus (formerly, Rhodopseudomonas capsulata) B 100 [35]. EPR results of six bacterial species indicate that the ground states of ferric cytochrome c' are in a quantum admixedspin state that consists of predominant S = 5 / 2 with an S = 3 / 2 character. In the present work, EPR spectra of ferric cytochrome c' isolated from five species of photo-

synthetic bacteria have been measured to investigate the electronic ground nature. Five bacterial strains are C. t~inosum ATCC 17899, Rb. capsulatus ATCC 11166, Rps. palustris ATCC 17001, R. molischianum ATCC 14031, and R. rubrum ATCC 11170. The electronic ground states of ferric cytochrome c' at physiological pH differ with the strain from which the cytochrome c' derived. All five species exhibit parameters in the range of a quantum admixed-spin state and these can be classified roughly into three types according to the contribution of an intermediate spin state. At pH 11.0, all five species show typical EPR spectra for high-spin heme proteins as have been pointed out previously [22,36]. These data, taken in conjunction with those previously reported, provide further evidence for the existence of an admixed intermediate spin ground state in cytochrome c'.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Materials
The strains of Chromatium vinosum ATCC 17899, Rhodobacter capsulatus ATCC 11166, Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001, Rhodospirillum molischianum ATCC 14031, and Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170 were generously provided by Prof. Toshio Sato, Hiroshima University. Cytochromes c' from these bacterial strains were isolated and purified according to the procedure reported by Bartsch [37]. The sample solution used in the EPR studies at pH 7.2 was in a 50 mM KH2PO4/Na2HPO 4 buffer and that at pH 11.0 was in a 100 mM K2HPOa/KOH buffer. The pH of the buffer was adjusted at room temperature (vide infra). All reagents were of the highest quality commercially available and used without further purification. It is worth noting that the pH of aqueous buffer solutions changes on freezing. The pH 7.2 and 11.0 buffers used in this study have been reported to show a pH drop of about 2 and 1 pH unit, respectively, on freezing at 77 K [38,39]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the apparent pH change is dependent on buffer and protein concentration [38]. EPR spectra of some of the proteins studied here have been reported, but they were measured at various pH's and in various buffers. Moreover, it has been pointed out that the EPR spectra of cytochromes c' were dependent on pH, buffer and ionic strength [22,31,40]. To avoid these complications, all the spectra were measured with the same buffer at each pH.

2.2. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy
EPR measurements were carried out with a JEOL RE-2X or TE-200 X-band spectrometer with 100-kHz field modulation at liquid helium temperature, equipped with a frequency counter and an Echo Electronics NMR field meter

EMF-2000A to get the accurate g values. Protein concentrations, which were determined from the alkaline pyridine hemochrome method [41], were in the range 0.1-0.3 mM.

2.3. Simulation of the spectra
Spectral simulation was carried out using a handmade simulation program for powder line shapes of an anisotropic paramagnetic species. The main routine calculating the line shape was kindly offered by Dr. Kouichi Fukui [42] and was modified to superimpose plural spectra stemming from plural species in consideration of double-integrated intensity by one of the authors, S.F. Theoretical foundation of this simulation program has been presented by Martinelli et al. [43]. The angular variations of the line widths, ~r, is assumed to behave in a similar manner to hyperfine structure,

where l i are the direction cosines between the magnetic field and the x,y,z-axis system, diagonalizing the g tensor. The Gaussian line shape is adopted for the convolution of the line shapes, because it gives better agreement with the observed spectrum than the Lorentzian line shape does.

3. Results Ferric cytochrome c' at pH 7.2. We have measured the EPR spectra of the ferric cytochrome c' from five bacterial strains. The EPR spectrum of the C. vinosum cytochrome c' has been previously reported and analyzed in detail [ 18], but there remain some ambiguous points. Thus we reexamined the C. vinosum cytochrome c'. Fig. 1A shows the EPR spectrum of cytochrome c' from C. vinosum at 6 K. The spectrum is similar to the one reported by Maltempo et al. [ 18]. Three spectral features are noticeable. First, the observed g values (gl = 5.32, g2 = 4.67, and g3 = 1.97) indicate that the electronic ground state of the cytochrome c' from C. vinosum is not a typical high-spin state. Here, each value of gl, g2, and g3 was obtained from the maximum in the region of g = 5.3, from the zero-crossing in the region of g = 4.7, and from the minimum in the region of g = 2, respectively. (In this study the g values are given in decreasing order as gl, g2, and g 3 . ) Secondly, as has been pointed out by Maltempo et al. [18], the lower field shoulder of the spectrum at g = 5.92 was observed. Thirdly, the signal of the g3 absorption has an asymmetric line shape. The high field wing decays gradually while the low field wing drops sharply. The simulation of the spectrum gives some clues to examine these spectral features. In connection with the second feature, it was not possible to simulate the spectrum with a single species. Our calculation indicates that the spectrum is attributed to at least two species. For example, superimposition of two spectra, which have a

weight ratio 19:1, gives a spectrum similar to the observed one (Fig. 1B). Major species has g values of g~ = 5.32, g2 = 4.40, and g3 = 2.00, and line widths of AH l = 8.0 mT, AH 2 = 40.0 mT, and AH 3 = 3.5 mT. Unfortunately, the signal of the minor species is too little to determine the spectral parameters precisely. We adopted here in Fig. 1B the g values of gl = 5.92, g2 = 5.90, and g3 = 2 . 0 0 , and line widths of AH l = 9.0 mT, AH 2 = 9.0 mT, and A n 3 = 3.5 mT. In fact, there is no significant difference in the line shape of the simulated spectrum, even if it is simulated with somewhat different parameter sets of g2, g3, A H j , AH 2, and A H 3. Only changes in gl give rise to shifts of the g = 5.92 shoulder sensitively with the adopted weight ratio. In any case, the spectral parameters of the minor species is uncertain. The existence of two species is also suggested by Maltempo et al. [18]. The simulation also indicates that the g values of the major species are certainly different from those of typical high-spin heme proteins. These anomalous g values of the cytochrome c' from C. vinosum were rationalized by Maltempo [44] with a model consisting of quantum mechanical admixtures of an intermediate spin state (S = 3 / 2 ) and a high-spin state (S = 5/2). The quantum mixed-spin heme is characterized by its EPR spectrum with g values of 4 < g i < 6 and gll = 2. Moreover, the g i value can be a measure of the percentage of the intermediate state [18,45]. From the calculation with the apparent g values,

the electronic ground state o f the C. r,inosum c y t o c h r o m e c' consists o f 51% intermediate spin state and 49% highspin state (Table 1), while with the simulated g values, it consists o f 57% intermediate spin state and 4 3 % high-spin state. In the simulated spectrum, the a s y m m e t r i c wings of g3 absorption are well reproduced. Such gentle slope o f highfield wing is certainly due to broad A H 2 (40.0 roT). There appears no a s y m m e t r i c line shape if it is simulated with the A H 2 values c o m p a r a b l e to AH~. Probably the difference b e t w e e n apparent g3 and simulated g3 is also due to broad A H 2. C y t o c h r o m e c' f r o m Rb. capsulatus exhibits considerably different E P R spectrum (Fig. 2A) f r o m C. r,inosum o n e ' s , but it is similar to the spectrum o f Rps. palustris c y t o c h r o m e c' (Fig. 2B). In Fig. 2A, a small signal around 150 m T is also observed. This signal is p r e s u m e d to stem from a n o n - h e m e iron impurity. E P R spectra o f cyt o c h r o m e c' from both bacterial strains were already reported [15,31], but their line shapes m e a s u r e d at 100 K [15] were distinct f r o m those m e a s u r e d at 6 K (Fig. 2A,B). As for R. capsulatus c y t o c h r o m e c', our E P R spectrum is similar to the reported one m e a s u r e d at 10 K and pH 6.1 [31]. The apparent g values, obtained in the same m a n n e r as C. t, inosum c y t o c h r o m e c', are listed in Table 1. F r o m the g values, it is estimated that the electronic ground state o f the c y t o c h r o m e c' f r o m Rb. capsulatus consists of 4 1 % intermediate spin state and 59% high-spin state, while that from Rps. palustris consists of 40% intermediate spin state and 60% high-spin state. These two E P R spectra can be simulated with a single species. H o w e v e r , the line shape o f the l o w e r field side o f the g j absorption in the

The conditions for the measurements were: modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1 mT; microwave frequency, 8.98 GHz; microwave power, 4 mW. Spectrum C is a simulated spectrum of R. molischianum cytochrome c'. The spectrum consisted of two species: species I, used effective g values, 5.96, 5.70, and 2.00, line width, 5.0, 20.0, and 2.0 mT; species II, used effective g values, 5.65, 5.45, and 2.00, line width, 5.0, 20.0, 2.0 mT. The weight factors of species I and II in the computer simulation are in a ratio of 1:1.

c a p s u l a t u s (simulated spectrum not shown) are listed in Table 1. The percentage of the intermediate spin state calculated from the simulated g values is 44% for both bacterial cytochrome c'. Fig. 3 A and 3B show the E P R spectra of cytochrome c'

from R. r u b r u m and from R. m o l i s c h i a n u m , respectively. These two spectra resemble each other, but differ from those of the former three. The apparent g values listed in Table 1 indicate that the ground state of the h e m e iron is p r e d o m i n a n t high-spin state with a slight intermediate spin state character. The c o m p o n e n t of the intermediate spin state is estimated to be 13% for both R h o d o s p i r i l l u m cytochromes c'. As for the R. r u b r u m cytochrome c', the electronic g r o u n d state has been studied by Mtissbauer and E P R spectroscopies [22]. The E P R spectrum reported by them is similar to ours and they suggested that the u n u s u a l g values are well interpreted in the framework of the spin H a m i l t o n i a n for the high-spin ferric ion, with the introduction of a slightly anisotropic go-tensor. W e adopt here, however, the model i n v o l v i n g a q u a n t u m mechanically admixed-spin state because of the consistency with the former three cytochromes c' which have deviation of g _1_ ( ( g l + g 2 ) / 2 ) from g = 6 large e n o u g h to regard their electronic ground states as a q u a n t u m mechanically admixed-spin state. Spectral simulations indicate the presence of at least two species for both R h o d o s p i r i l l u m proteins as well as C h r o m a t i u m protein. As has b e e n pointed out by Emptage

et al. [22], the intensity around g = 5.7 was always too low compared to the actual spectrum if the spectrum simulated with a single species. One can simulate the spectrum with a single species if the line shape of the spectrum is like one of the cytochrome c' from A. xylosoxidans GIFU 1048 [34]. Fig. 3C shows the simulated spectrum of R. molischianum cytochrome c'. Here, we assumed the presence of two signals which have a weight ratio of 1:1. The simulation parameters of R. molischianum and R. rubrum (simulated spectrum not shown) are listed in Table 1. Our calculation indicates that the order of g values of species I and species II is important. If the g values are nested like g 2 ( I ) < g l ( I I ) , the second peak around g = 5.7 becomes dull and the spectrum become worse fitting. Therefore the difference between two species seems to be large. The percentage of the intermediate spin state calculated from the simulated g values is as follows: R. molischianum, 9% for species I, 23% for species II; R. rubrum, 6% for species I, 21% for species II (Table 1). In the EPR spectra of the five cytochrome c', the peak depth of the signal around g = 5 is unusually small and the peak depth at g = 2 is unusually large. The relative intensity among g l , g2, and g3 signals is very characteristic compared with that of model intermediate and highspin complexes [46-49] and typical high-spin heme proteins whose spectra were measured at liquid helium temperature. Considering the parameters obtained by simulation, these spectral features are probably due to large AH 2 compared to AH 3. Ferric cytochrome c' at pH 11.0. The EPR spectra of five c y t o c h r o m e s c' b u f f e r e d in p o t a s s i u m

phosphate/potassium hydroxide ( p H l 1.0) were also measured. In all proteins, a pH-dependent spectral transition was observed and this transition was reversible. To give an example, Fig. 4 shows the EPR spectrum of R. molischianum protein at pH 11.0. In comparison with the spectrum at pH 7.2 (Fig. 3B), the intensity around g = 5.7 is low and the relative intensity of g3 absorption to g2 one is very low. As for C. vinosum and R. rubrum protein, the EPR spectra are nearly in agreement with the reported values of B~ state (pH 11.0) for C. c'inosum [36] and of the glycine buffered species (pH 9.5) for R. rubrum [22]. The apparent g values of five proteins are all in the range of typical high-spin heme proteins ( g ± = 6) such as cytochrome c peroxidase [50] and hemoglobin M Boston [51] (Table 2), although there are small differences of g 1 from g = 6.

We have measured the EPR spectra of cytochrome c' from five photosynthetic bacteria at pH 7.2 and 11.0. At pH 7.2, all proteins exhibited parameters in the range of quantum mechanically admixed intermediate spin state. According to the Maltempo's theory [19], quantum mechanical mixing of spin states will occur if there are non-zero matrix elements of spin-orbit interaction between the different spin states and if the energy separation between the unperturbed pure high-spin (6A l) and intermediate spin (4A=) states is comparable or less than the spin-orbit coupling constant (ca. 300 cm-1). Thus the contribution of each unperturbed spin state to the ground state is determined by the ratio of the crystal field parameter and the spin-orbit coupling constant. Interestingly the contribution of the intermediate spin state to the ground state depends upon the bacterial source from which the cytochrome c' is derived. On the one hand the protein from five A. xylosoxidans strains show spectral similarity and their ground state is a weakly spin-mixed state (ca. 90% S = 5 / 2 , ca. 10% S = 3 / 2 ; Table 1, [34]); on the other hand, the proteins from five photosynthetic bacteria studied here show three patterns of spectra and three types of spin-mixed state (Table 1). Since we expect little variation in the spin-orbit coupling constant for these protein, this variation reflects the strength of axial ligand field. The heme iron in cytochromes c' is pentacoordinate and is displaced from the mean heme plane toward the fifth ligand histidine which is exposed to solvent. Weak field axial ligation and small iron displacement from the mean heme plane are common structural properties for quantum mechanical admixed-spin state in cytochrome c' [9-11] and model porphyrin complexes [45,46,53-58]. In model studies, there is a clear correlation between spin state of the heme iron and the Fe-Ct distances (Fig. 5). The Fe-Ct distances for the high-spin five-coordinated por-

phyrin complexes are > 0.47 A [47,57,59,60]. On the other hand, for admixed-spin five-coordinated porphyrin complexes, the Fe-Ct distances are in the range 0.10-0.36 A [45,46,53-58]. Further, the amount of S = 3 / 2 character increases as the Fe-Ct distance decreases. Therefore, the variation of degrees of S = 3 / 2 character present in proteins studied here seems to reflect the amount of the heme iron displacement in protein; that is, Fe-Ct distance is expected to increase in the following order: C. vinosum
< Rb. capsulatus ~ Rps. palustris < R. molischianum ..~ R. rubrum. Although the reported values of the iron displacement are 0.3 A (Fe-Ct) for C. vinosum [11], 0.2 A (Fe-Ct and Fe-4 pyrrole nitrogen) for R. rubrum [10], and 0.5 ~, (Fe-4 pyrrole nitrogen) for R. molischianum [9], it is

probably due to the poor resolution of the X-ray analysis of the protein compared to that of the model complexes. Although most of EPR spectra of the cytochrome c' and model porphyrin complexes previously reported [15,18,46-49,61,62] have been analyzed as axially symmetric spectra, the computer simulations of the spectra obtained in this study indicate that the heme iron in five cytochromes c' is under rhombic symmetry. EPR spectra of model complexes can be well simulated with axially symmetric g tensor [49]. It seems, however, that the spectra of the protein could not be well simulated with such parameters. As for C. vinosum cytochrome c', Maltempo et al. [18] simulated the spectrum with axially symmetric g tensor and isotropic large line width (ca. 35 mT), so that the features around 100 mT and 330 mT could not be reproduced. On the other hand, the spectrum simulated with rhombic g tensor and anisotropic line width ( A H I = 8.0 mT, A H 2 = 40.0 mT, and A H 3 = 3.5 mT) well reproduced the actual spectrum (Fig. 1A,B). For five cytochromes c', calculation with large A H 2 values compared to AH~ and A H 3 gives well-fitted spectra. In particular for C. vinosum protein, it seems that the large A H 2 causes the asymmetric line shape of g3 absorption. These large line widths are mainly due to 'g strain' broadening [63,64] induced by variations in the fine structure term. It seems, however, to be difficult to reproduce the shoulder observed at low field side, e.g., a signal at about 100 mT in Fig. 1A, by considering only the g strain broadening. Hence, we consider that the shoulder observed in Fig. 1A is derived from a minor species which has a slightly different heine environment (vide infra). In general, the line widths of the EPR of metalloproteins result from homogeneous broadening from spin-lattice relaxation and spin-spin interactions, unresolved metal ion hyperfine structure, and unresolved ligand hyperfine structure [43], and from inhomogeneous broadening called 'g strain' [63,64]. A large difference between A H 1 and A H 2 suggests that the electronic state in heme plane is anisotropic. In our simulation program these factors are collected into A H i (i = 1, 2, 3). The origin of these highly anisotropic line widths remain uncertain. However, it is certain that the highly anisotropic line widths make the spectral shape

unique. It is worth while to note that these highly anisotropic line widths are not seen in other high-spin heme proteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin [52]. The reason why these spectral features can be observed only in cytochrome c', particularly in Chromatium protein, remains unclarified. As a result of computer simulation, it is suggested that at least two heterogeneous magnetic species are present for C. vinosum, R. rubrum, and R. molischianum cytochrome c' at physiological pH. The same thing has been pointed out for C. vinosum 18] and R. rubrum [22] proteins by EPR and Mtissbauer spectroscopies. As for Rb. capsulatus and Rps. palustris proteins, their EPR spectra can be simulated with a single species. However, as mentioned in Section 3, the possibility of the presence of a small high-spin component is undeniable. At pH 11.0, all five cytochromes c' studied here exhibit EPR spectra originated from a spectroscopically pure state. These results suggest that the EPR spectra of C. vinosum, R. rubrum, and R. molischianum cytochrome c' at physiological pH arise from the protein molecules in at least two different conformational states with slightly different heme environments. In general, cytochrome c' is isolated as a dimer. Therefore, it is most likely that the heme iron in each subunit is under slightly different environment. Indeed, this may be true for Rhodospirillum proteins because the ratio of two species is 1:1. However, this is not true for Chromatium protein because, even if there is a small high-spin component for Rhodobacter, Rhodopseudomonas, and Achromobacter proteins, there is much difference in quantity between two species. Moreover, Rps. palustris cytochrome c' has been isolated as a monomer exceptionally [65-67]. Another possibility is denaturation of the protein during purification. However, the ratio of two species is reproducible, and if so, it turns out that the stability of the protein molecule depends upon the bacterial source. In any case, the origin of this heterogeneity does not seem to be so simple. The electronic ground state of ferric cytochrome c' from various bacterial sources has been investigated by various techniques and has been proposed as a high-spin state or a quantum mechanically admixed-spin state of a high spin and an intermediate spin. In this study, we have investigated the cytochrome c' from five photosynthetic bacteria. All EPR parameters obtained are in the range of quantum mechanically admixed-spin state, but the contents of an intermediate spin state are classified into three groups; = 50%, C. L'inosum: ~ 40%, Rb. capsulatus and Rps. palustris: = 10%, R. molischianum and R. rubrum. Concerning the Rhodospirillum proteins, the EPR spectra can be also analyzed by a spin Hamiltonian for a high-spin ferric configuration with minor perturbation due to admixing of an intermediate spin state [22]. In fact, some investigators support the high-spin ferric configuration for the RhodospiriIlum proteins [22-26,68]. As judged from the EPR data obtained here, however, a quantum mechanically

admixed-spin configuration is valid for at least other three bacterial proteins. Therefore, we should pay attention to the bacterial source of the cytochrome c' when we discuss the electronic ground nature of the protein. In summary, we have found and clarified that the electronic ground nature of ferric cytochrome c' from photosynthetic bacteria depends upon the bacterial source. The EPR spectra suggest that the electronic ground states of five species discussed here are well described by a quantum mechanically admixed-spin model and that the contents of S = 3 / 2 state differ with the bacterial source of the protein. From the model complex studies, the correlation between the content of S = 3 / 2 state and the Fe-Ct distance is indicated. Hence, the variation of the contents of S = 3 / 2 observed in the protein seems to reflect subtle differences of the heme environment. The results obtained give rise to two problems. One is whether there is a relationship between the electronic ground nature and the function of the cytochrome c', although its specific role has not been established. The other is the existence of plural EPR distinguishable species. Further systematic investigation will elucidate these points.
