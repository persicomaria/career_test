Abstract Polygalacturonases (PGs) hydrolyze the pectins present in the cell walls of higher plants. PGs prefer pectic acid rather than pectins as substrate and methylesterification of pectic acid is known to inhibit the activity of fungal PG. In order to identify the molecular basis of the differential specificity towards the substrates, octagalacturonic acid and its methylesterified derivative are flexibly docked with tomato PG and fungal PG. The substrate octagalacturonic acid is found to bind with the non-reducing end towards the N-terminus of PG whereas its methylesterified derivative binds in opposite direction with both the PGs. Both methylesterified derivative complexes did not show the catalytically important Asp residue in the interaction map suggesting strongly the inactiveness of the PGs with the methylesterified substrate. The tomato PGeoctagalacturonic acid complex possesses stronger interaction when compared to its methylesterified substrate whereas it is the methylesterified substrate, which shows stronger interaction in the fungal PG explaining its inhibition mode.

1. Introduction Polygalacturonases (PGs) hydrolyze the a-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds between adjacent galacturonic acid residues and release oligogalacturonides. They are classified as endo-PGs and exoPGs, according to their mode of action [1]. PGs are classified as the family 28 of glycosyl hydrolases based on amino acid sequence similarity [2e4]. Pickersgill and coworkers [5] performed sequence alignment of endo-PGs that revealed four conserved regions: Asn-Thr-Asp, Gly-Asp-Asp, Gly-His-Gly, and Arg-Ile-Lys and this clustering indicates the functional conservation. Based on sequence analysis it was found that eight residues are strictly conserved [6] and site-directed mutagenesis study in fungal PGs suggested that three Asp residues (180, 201, and 202; numbered with respect to Aspergillus niger endopolygalacturonase II) are directly involved in catalysis, Arg (256) and Lys (258) residues in substrate binding and a His residue

(223) in maintaining the proper ionization state of the catalytic Asp [7]. PGs are of inverting type i.e., the glycosidic linkages are hydrolyzed by a single displacement mechanism with inversion in anomeric configuration [8]. Glycosidases have a pair of carboxylic acid groups at the active site; one acting as a general acid donating a proton to the glycosidic oxygen of the scissile bond and the other as a general base which activates a water molecule that performs a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of sugar. ° In inverting enzymes these two residues are approximately 10 A apart but crystal structure analysis of endo-PGs showed them to ° be only 5.6 A apart suggesting that the protonation of the glycosidic oxygen and nucleophilic attack at the anomeric carbon are at the same side of the bond in a-linked polysaccharides [5,9]. This suggested mechanism could be confirmed either by a threedimensional structure of an enzymeesubstrate complex or a highresolution structure with substrate modeled to a high accuracy. In this study the latter approach was adopted to understand the influence of the functional clusters [5] and the conserved residues [6] of the PG family in substrate binding through docking.

It has been reported that methylesterification is known to inhibit the activity of fungal PG more than plant PG and the substrate specificity study demonstrated that polygalacturonase preferred pectic acid rather than pectins as substrate [10]. Therefore in order to understand the substrate preference, octagalacturonic acid (PGA) and its methylesterified derivative (PGM) were docked to tomato PG (modeled structure; since no plant PG structures are available yet) and fungal PG (PDB ID: 1czf). The results obtained were then correlated with the enzymatic activity of PG on the substrate. 2. Methodology 2.1. Sequence analysis The sequences of known PGs were extracted from the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database [11] and only Swiss-Prot database entries were used for the analysis.

Multiple sequence analysis was carried out using CLUSTALW program [12] version 1.83 and few manual adjustments to the alignment were also made. 2.2. Three-dimensional structure prediction of tomato PG The Swiss-Prot accession number for the sequence that was used for constructing the model of tomato PG is P05117 and the matured protein has 386 residues [13]. Search for homologous structures to be used as template by BLAST server yielded five b-helical proteins (1bhe, 1nhc, 1czf, 1hg8 and 1ib4) with similar scores, 41e47% sequence similarity. Superposition using the viewer program Deepview/Swiss-PDB Viewer, Release 3.7 (SP3) and secondary structure calculation carried out by DSSP program [14] showed that the five templates are structurally very similar with the RMS deviation ° being within 1.6 A and the percentage secondary structure identity being more than 80%. It was inferred from these

analyses that no single structure could be chosen as superior than the other, and therefore all of them were chosen to perform a profile-based analysis. In this analysis structure based sequence alignment for all the template structures was carried out using STAMP software [15] and based on this structural alignment an average structure was constructed and this model was chosen as the template for structure prediction (Fig. S1 in Supplementary data). For this model the side chains are built using the Biopolymer module of the INSIGHTII package of BIOSYM [16]. The loop regions were constructed using both INSIGHTII and Swiss-PDB Viewer packages. This model was then submitted to the Optimise mode of the Swiss-Model server [17] for structure optimization, which performs energy minimization and molecular dynamics to remove steric

clashes. The model was verified using WHATCHECK [18] program and Ramachandran plot which showed minimum abnormalities (taking into account only the non-glycine and non-N or non-C-terminal residues, 86% of the residues in the most favored regions and the remaining residues in the additionally allowed regions) indicating the structure to be stereochemically good. 2.3. Docking studies The octagalacturonic acid, eight monomer units of a-D-galacturonic acid (GalpA) joined through 1-4 linkage, was built using the modeling kit of the SWEET (Program 2) database as an unbent irregular helix. The monomer of this modeled octagalacturonic acid (PGA) is named starting from þ4 through þ1, À1 through À4. The pyranose ring of the GalpAÀ1 residue of PGA has a half-chair (4H3) form while other rings have a relaxed chair (4C1) form. The geometrical arrangement of the catalytically important three Asp residues in the crystal structure required GalpAÀ1eGalpAþ1 segment to be in a strained conformation if both the rings adopt relaxed chair form and therefore the pyranose ring of GalpAÀ1 residue is proposed to have high energy form [19,20]. This substrate distortion at À1 subsite is important for the stabilization of the oxocarbenium-ion-like transition state [21]. Various forms such as chair, twist-boat and half-chair were considered for the GalpAÀ1 residue in this study but only the half-chair form produced biochemically suitable model. This model of PGA was optimized by constrained energy minimization using AMBER force field available in the DISCOVER tool of the Insight II package of BIOSYM. The substrate model was then flexibly docked, the backbone torsion angles f ¼ (ORieC1ieOiþ1eC4iþ1) and j ¼ (C1ieOiþ1eC4iþ1eC5iþ1) of the PGA were allowed to

vary, to the predicted structure of tomato PG and the crystal structure of fungal PG (A-chain of 1czf). AutoDOCK program version 3.0.5 [22] was used for this docking. Water molecules were not used for the docking studies as it makes the analysis complicated. Twenty-five best configurations of the proteine ligand complexes were retrieved and the one that supports the biochemical studies was chosen. The hydrogen bond and nonbonded contacts for the complexes were calculated using the program HBPLUS [23] and the pictorial representations are drawn using the program LIGPLOT [24]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Identification of functional clusters in PGs In order to ascertain once again the role of functional clustering sequence analysis of all PGs from different species was carried out. The Swiss-Prot entries are presented in Table 1. Multiple sequence alignment (Fig. S2 in Supplementary data) yielded five major clusters, Asn-Thr-Asp, Asp-Asp, Gly-HisGly, Ser-Ile-Gly-Ser, Arg-Ile-Lys, and these clustering indicates the functional conservation. Pickersgill and coworkers [5] did not detect Ser-Ile-Gly-Ser cluster that was identified in this analysis. In addition in the second cluster they proposed a Gly residue before Asp-Asp but this residue differs according to speciation. In bacterial and plant PGs, Gly residue is conserved whereas in fungal PG the Gln residue is found. In addition a few important residues adjacent to these clusters were also noted and they were found to differ according to speciation. These residual differences may be important as they cluster around the active site region. Probably these speciation differences may contribute to the specificity of the PGs in various organisms.

3.2. Specificity of tomato PG with PGA and PGM substrates In tomato PGeoctaGalpA complex (Fig. 1), with docked energy 2.41 kcal/mol, the non-reducing end of the substrate is directed towards the N-terminus of the enzyme as suggested by Pages et al. [25]. The glycosidic torsion angles f and j and the backbone bond angle t ¼ (C1ieOiþ1eC4iþ1) of the modeled PGA molecule in the complex are given in Table 2. This conformation of PGA did not show any preference for the 21 (t ¼ 117 , f ¼ 80 and j ¼ 161 ) or 31 (t ¼ 117 , f ¼ 80 and j ¼ 89 ) helix [26] but has intermediate conformation. The NMR study on the structure of pectate in plant cell wall predicted a complex conformation, containing both 21 and 31 helices as well as intermediate conformational states [27]. This confirms the reliability of the tomato PGeoctaGalpA complex configuration. The detailed hydrogen bondings and non-bonded interaction mode between the protein and the substrate are shown in Fig. 2(a) and the amino acid residues in the protein within ° 7 A distance from the ligand is given in Table 3. The important regions identified from sequence analysis by Pickersgill and coworkers [5] and also by ours are related to functional clustering and found to interact with the PGA molecule. In the Ser225-Ile226-Gly227-Ser228 clustering only Ser228 is found to interact with PGA and in the Arg-Ile-Lys clustering Ile residue does not show interaction in this model. The subsite residues of tomato PG identified based on structural alignment with fungal PG (1czf) are shown in Fig. 3. The residues in the À2, À1, þ1 and þ2 subsite regions of the tomato PGs are found to interact with the substrate molecule through hydrogen bonding, non-bonded or water mediated interactions. It is surprising to note that the residue Tyr290 at subsite þ1 and Gln288 at subsite þ2 has no interaction suggesting that the conformation at the reducing end of the substrate has to be re-examined. But conformational changes performed manually at the reducing end of the substrate did not produce any biochemically suitable configuration. It is interesting to note that in the complex configuration of tomato PGeoctaGalpA, His222 makes hydrogen bond with the GalpAþ1 residue and Asn176 interacting with GalpAþ1 residue and glycosidic bond between GalpAÀ1eGalpAÀ2. These two hydrogen bonds may probably stabilize the half-chair form of the pyranose ring in GalpAÀ1 residue. The residue His222 is also found to interact through hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen atom of Asp199. These hydrogen bonded interactions confirm the predicted roles of His222 as distorting the galacturonate residue in subsite À1 [19] and maintaining the proper ionization state of the carboxylate (Asp199) involved in catalysis by sharing a proton [7]. From this model it is also noted that the Asn176 residue is also found to stabilize the conformation of the GalpAÀ1eGalpAþ1 segment. The interaction mode of the best model obtained for the methylesterified galacturonic acid is shown in Fig. 2(b), the docked energy being 1.03 kcal/mol. Surprisingly the non-reducing end of the substrate is directed towards the C-terminus of the enzyme and this is in contrary with the PGA complex.

The residues that are underlined are found in the functional clustering. Bolded ones represent the residues involved in various subsite regions and the residues involved in hydrogen bonding with the substrate are in italics.

Restriction imposed on the PGM molecules to take up similar orientation as that of PGA during docking produced many steric hindrances with PG and so this model was chosen. Only few residues involved in the five functional clustering regions are observed and the residues involved in the À2, À1, þ1 and þ2 subsite regions are found to interact with the exception of Ile151 in subsite À2 and the catalytic residue Asp200. In this model, His222 residue is hydrogen bonded directly to GalpAÀ1 residue and Asp199. Comparatively this tomato PGePGM

complex has minimum interactions and also found to bind in the opposite mode (non-reducing towards C-terminus of PG). Since the substrate is bound in the opposite direction and the catalytic residue Asp200 has no interaction, tomato PG cannot hydrolyze PGM and because the interactions are weak when compared with PGA complex strong inhibition of the methylesterified substrate of tomato PG is unlikely. These suggest that tomato PG is specific for PGA and methylesterification of the substrate may not inhibit it. 3.3. Specificity of fungal PG with PGA and PGM substrates As observed for tomato PGePGA complex in the docked complex of fungal PG with octaGalpA (docked energy 5.10 kcal/mol) the non-reducing end is directed towards the N-terminus of the fungal PG and the substrate has mixed (21 and 31 helical) and intermediate conformations. Residues

belonging to the five functional clusters are found to interact with the substrate molecule with the exception of one residue in each cluster. Only residues that are proposed to be in the À2, À1 and þ1 subsites are found in the interaction map of this fungal PGePGA complex configuration (Fig. 4(a)). The þ2 subsite residues found in tomato PGesubstrate complex are not identified in this model. The residues Asn178, Arg256 and Lys258 found in the subsites À1 and þ1 are observed to make hydrogen bonds with GalpAÀ1 residue of PGA substrate. These hydrogen bonds stabilize the high energy (half-chair) form of the GalpAÀ1 residue. The residue His223 is not found to make hydrogen bond with the substrate as observed in the tomato PG complex but has non-bonded interactions. The complex of fungal PG with methylesterified PGA substrate (docked energy 5.24 kcal/mol) is shown in Fig. 1(b) and the non-bonded contacts in Fig. 4(b). The substrate binds in the protein with the non-reducing end towards the C-terminal

similar to the tomato PGePGM complex. Most of the residues of the five functional clusters are found to interact with the substrate and the subsite residues of À1, þ1 and þ2 are also observed to interact. Surprisingly the catalytic residue Asp202 has no interaction as noted in the tomato PGePGM complex. It is interesting to note that His223 makes hydrogen bond with GalpAÀ2 and Asn178 with GalpAþ1 similar to the tomato PGePGA complex. These interactions stabilize the half-chair form of GalpAÀ1 and also maintain the proper ionization state of the Asp200 residue. These interactions produce strong binding of the methylesterified substrate to the fungal PG than the PGA substrate. This predicted fungal PGePGM complex configuration can explain the inhibition of PG with the methylesterification of the substrate as reported by Dinu [10]. The PGM substrate binds in the opposite direction to the fungal PG and the catalytically important Asp202 residue is not found in the interaction map, which does not allow the methylesterified substrate to hydrolyze and due to the presence of more interactions (than PGA) it binds strongly with the PGM and therefore the inhibition is observed. 4. Conclusion Octagalacturonic acid and the methylesterified substrate are flexibly docked with the tomato PG and the fungal PG. The important functional regions and the residues are identified in the resultant complexes. The substrate PGA is found to bind with the non-reducing end towards the N-terminus whereas the PGM binds in opposite direction with both complexes. Both PGM complexes did not show the catalytically important Asp residue (200 in tomato and 202 in fungal PG) in the interaction map suggesting strongly the inactiveness of the PGs with the methylesterified substrate. The tomato PGe PGA complex possesses stronger interaction when compared to its methylesterified substrate whereas it is the methylesterified substrate which shows stronger interaction in the fungal PG. This study explains the inhibition of the fungal PG with the methylesterification of the substrate.
