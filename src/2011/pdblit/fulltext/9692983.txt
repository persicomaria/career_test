ABSTRACT: The solution structure and backbone dynamics of the recombinant, ferrous CO-ligated form of component IV monomeric hemoglobin from Glycera dibranchiata (GMH4CO) have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Distance geometry and simulated annealing calculations utilizing a total of 2550 distance and torsion angle constraints yielded an ensemble of 29 structures with an overall average backbone rmsd of 0.48 Å from the average structure. Differences between the solution structure and a related crystal structure are confined to regions of lower precision in either the NMR or X-ray structure, or in regions where the amino acid sequences differ. 15N relaxation measurements at 76.0 and 60.8 MHz were analyzed with an extended model-free approach, and revealed low-frequency motions in the vicinity of the heme, concentrated in the F helix. Amide proton protection factors were obtained from H-D amide exchange measurements on 15N-labeled protein. Patterns in the backbone dynamics and protection factors were shown to correlate with regions of heterogeneity and disorder in the ensemble of NMR structures and with large crystallographic B-factors in the X-ray structures. Surprisingly, while the backbone atoms of the F helix have higher rmsds and larger measures of dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale than the other helices, amide protection factors for residues in the F helix were observed to be similar to those of the other helices. This contrasts with H-D amide exchange measurements on sperm whale myoglobin which indicated low protection for the F helix (S. N. Loh and B. F. Volkman, unpublished results). These results for GMH4 suggest a model in which the F helix undergoes collective motions as a relatively rigid hydrogen-bonded unit, possibly pivoting about a central position near residue Val87.

The globin family of oxygen-binding heme proteins has been the focus of structure-function analysis by X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics, and NMR spectroscopy for nearly 40 years (1-3). Interest in these proteins remains high, partly because a precise understanding of the mechanism of ligand binding to the heme iron is lacking. Because the heme pocket is effectively inaccessible to solvent, ligand

entry must involve some amount of protein structural rearrangement. Time-resolved X-ray crystallography methods have recently been used in an attempt to directly observe the internal motions associated with ligand associationdissociation in sperm whale myoglobin (Mb)1 (4). Recently developed NMR methods for measuring orientation-dependent nuclear dipolar couplings have also been applied to Mb and implicate the H helix in slow collective motions (5). Interest in Glycera dibranchiata monomeric hemoglobins (GMH), a subgroup of the globin superfamily, stems from their unusual ligand binding properties and amino acid substitutions at sequence positions that are highly conserved in other members of the globin family. For example, the E7 Leu found in all GMH proteins replaces the highly conserved globin distal His. Furthermore, sequencing and modeling studies (6) predict that the protein studied here, GMH4, has a B10 Phe, which is normally a Leu in the globin family (7). These hydrophobic side chains create an extremely apolar ligand-binding pocket and may contribute to the altered ligand binding properties of these proteins (8-11). NMR analysis first revealed the reversed orientation

Monomeric Hemoglobin Structure and Dynamics of the heme cofactor in GMH proteins, relative to that of myoglobin (Mb) (12). Recent studies have elucidated the sequences of three naturally isolated GMH proteins (GMH2, GMH3, and GMH4) and have led to the production of recombinant wildtype GMH4 (13, 14). These sequence determinations, in combination with a comprehensive mass spectrometry analysis (6, 15, 16), indicate that the amino acid sequence of the published crystal structures (17, 18) does not correspond to an actual GMH protein and that the crystals contained a complex mixture of many GMH proteins. The work reported here reveals the structure of a true GMH protein, CO-ligated GMH4. The amino acid sequence of GMH4 differs at 11 positions from that of the crystal structures. We recently reported comprehensive 1H, 15N, and 13 C resonance assignments for GMH4CO and numerous heme-protein contacts obtained by means of isotope-filtered NOESY experiments (14). Here we continue this work by presenting the high-resolution solution structure of GMH4CO, along with an analysis of backbone dynamics from 15N relaxation measurements and amide H-D exchange rates. NMR relaxation provides a sensitive probe of internal molecular dynamics at atomic resolution (19). We have analyzed the 15N relaxation measurements of GMH4CO within the model-free framework of Lipari and Szabo (20, 21) to obtain generalized order parameters (S2) and correlation times for internal motion (e) for the N-H bond vectors of the backbone. In addition, residues that show evidence of chemical exchange broadening due to slow motions on the microsecond to millisecond time scale required fitting of an additional parameter (Rex). A number of residues in the F helix of GMH4CO located on the proximal side of the heme were found to experience slow motions of this type; however, no evidence was seen for similar dynamic properties for residues comprising the distal heme pocket. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sample Preparation. Previously published procedures (14) were used in overexpressing G. dibranchiata component IV monomeric hemoglobin (GMH4) in Escherichia coli, U-15N and U-13C,15N labeling, purifying, and reconstituting the apoprotein with b-type hemin. The reduced carbon monoxideligated (CO) form of GMH4 was produced from pure ferric GMH4 by reduction with an excess of sodium dithionite. All experiments discussed below were performed on samples in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer with 100 mM KCl at pH 5.0 in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 99.9% D2O saturated with CO. Final protein concentrations were 3.5 and 3 mM for the 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled samples, respectively. A sample for amide H-D exchange experiments was prepared by lyophilizing a sample of fully reduced 15N-labeled GMH4CO in 90% H2O/10% D2O and resuspending it in 99.9% CO-saturated D2O with 1 equiv of sodium dithionite. All NMR sample tubes were purged with CO and capped. NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR spectra were recorded at 20 °C on Bruker DMX750, DMX600, and DMX500 spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance 1H, 13C, and 15N probes and Z- or three-axis pulsed field gradient capabilities. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was obtained in the echo-antiecho mode (22) or with the States-TPPI method (23). Gradient pulses as a

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 31, 1998 10907 combination of X- and Z-gradients at the "magic angle" (24, 25) were used for coherence selection in all three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) NOESY experiments to maximize water supression. Quantitative heteronuclear J correlation experiments (26) were used to obtain stereospecific assignments of prochiral methyl and methylene groups in the protein, as well as values for , 1, and 2 dihedral angles, as described previously (14). A 4D 13C/15N HMQC-NOESY-HSQC spectrum was collected at 500.13 MHz with a mixing time of 100 ms and spectral widths and time domain sizes (where * indicates complex points) of 4000 Hz and 16* 13C points in f1, 5701.25 Hz and 64* 1H points in f2, 1666.67 Hz and 16* 15N points in f3, and 3004.81 Hz and 512* 1H points in f4. A 100 ms 3D 15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum was acquired with spectral widths and time domain sizes of 1666.67 Hz and 36* 15N points in f1, 7716.05 Hz and 128* 1H points in f2, and 7716.05 Hz and 1024* 1H points in f3. A 3D 13C NOESY-HSQC spectrum was acquired at 600.13 MHz with an 80 ms mixing time and spectral widths and time domain sizes of 6250 Hz and 48* 13C points in f1, 9090.90 Hz and 237* 1H points in f2, and 8333.33 Hz and 512* 1H points in f3. Since the heme b used during reconstitution of the holoprotein was not isotopically enriched, isotope-edited and -filtered NOESY experiments were used to identify intra-heme and hemeprotein NOEs, as described previously (14). A series of 22 2D 15N HSQC experiments were carried out at 499.84 MHz in 99.9% D2O over a period of 14 days for the determination of amide H-D exchange rates and protection factors. Each spectrum was acquired with 256* points and a spectral width of 1666.67 Hz in the 15N dimension and 1024* points and a spectral width of 8333.33 Hz in the 1H dimension. Spectra were acquired 18, 48, 78, 108, 400, 460, 520, 580, 640, 700, 820, 880, 940, 1000, 1060, 1120, 12 840, 17 429, 17 533, 18 433, and 18 520 min after dissolving the lyophilized protein in D2O. Relaxation parameters were measured at 750.13 MHz (15N T1 and T2 and 1H-15N NOE) and 600.13 MHz (T2 only) 1H frequencies. All pulse schemes utilized gradients for sensitivity enhancement and selective pulses for water flip-back (27). All spectra were acquired with 16 scans per FID, 200* 15N points, and 1024* 1H points. Spectral widths at 750 (600) MHz were 10 000 (8333.33) Hz in the 1H dimension and 2500 (2000) Hz in the 15N dimension. T2 values at 750 MHz were obtained with nine different durations of the delay T: 8, 16, 33, 50, 66, 99, 132, 198, and 264 ms. T2 values at 600 MHz were obtained with T values of 0, 8, 16, 32, 48, 64, 96, and 128 ms. T1 values at 750 MHz were obtained with T values of 10, 60, 120, 200, 400, 800, 1400, and 2200 ms. Duplicate spectra were recorded for T values of 10 and 200 ms (T1), T values of 8 and 66 ms (T2, 750 MHz), and T values of 0 and 64 ms (T2, 600 MHz) for estimation of peak height uncertainties. All Fourier transformation of NMR data was performed with FELIX95 (Molecular Simulations). In most cases, the indirect dimension with the least amount of digitization was extended with linear prediction by no more than 50% of the original data size. Typically, an 85°-shifted squared sine bell window function was applied to each FID prior to zero filling to the final matrix size, Fourier transformation, and phase correction. The initial values for incremented delays in multidimensional experiments were set in a manner that

10908 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 31, 1998 allowed predictable phasing in each dimension and minimized roll and offset of the baseline (28). All 1H dimensions were indirectly referenced to a separate 10 mM DSS (2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate) sample at 20 °C in the NMR buffer discussed above. Indirect 13C and 15N dimensions were referenced indirectly to DSS as previously described (29). Chemical shifts and peak intensities of all NOESY spectra were tabulated with the PPFLX package (30), while Felix macros provided by M. Akke were used to obtain peak intensities of 2D 15N HSQC spectra for relaxation and amide H-D exchange measurements.2 Structure Calculations and Analysis. The hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing approach (31) was used for determination of the three-dimensional structure of GMH4CO from NOE and dihedral constraints with the program X-PLOR 3.843 (32). Calculations were performed in parallel on a Silicon Graphics (Mountain View, CA) Onyx computer equipped with 6 R10000 processors. The covalent geometry of the heme and carbon monoxy (CO) ligand and XPLOR patch residues defining the CO-heme and heme-His90 coordinate-covalent bonds were derived from the XPLOR parameter files parallh22x.pro and topallh22x.pro. The C-Fe and Fe-N 2 distances were fixed to 1.90 and 2.20 Å, respectively, and defined as colinear. Aside from the linkage between the side chain of His90 and the heme iron, only experimental NOE constraints (158) were used to define the position of the heme within the protein matrix. In each round of refinement, a total of 50 starting structures were generated with substructure embedding and regularized with 1000 steps of simulated annealing at 2000 K and 1000 cooling steps. The final refinement stage included 2500 cooling steps from a temperature of 2000 K. Distance constraints were obtained by means of a series of Perl (33) scripts. For each NOESY cross-peak, a list of 1H-1H pairs was generated by comparison with the database of 1H, 15N, and 13C GMH4CO resonance assignments3 (14, 34). This output was filtered against the structure resulting from the previous round of refinement, removing all combinations with an interatomic distance greater than a chosen threshold. Unambiguously assigned NOEs were added to the list of constraints for the next stage of calculations. Constraints for the initial round of refinement were obtained from the 4D 13C-15N NOESY cross-peaks, which were often unambiguously assigned by chemical shift alone, as well as from other NOEs, which were evaluated conservatively (using a 12 Å threshold) against a previously constructed model structure of GMH4CO (6). Backbone  and side chain 1 and 2 dihedral angle constraints were obtained from quantitative heteronuclear J correlation experiments as described elsewhere (14). The Procheck/NMR (53) and X-PLOR software packages were used for analysis of the final family of 29 accepted structures. Determination of 15N Relaxation Parameters and the Initial Estimate of m.

were resolved sufficiently. Uncertainties in peak intensitites were estimated from duplicate measurements for the T1 and T2 experiments, and from the rms baseplane noise for the NOE experiment. The cpmgr2 program was used for fitting the data to obtain values for 1/T1 and 1/T2 by the LevenbergMarquardt method (35). Uncertainties for 1/T1 and 1/T2 were obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and were typically 2-3% larger than those obtained from the least-squares fit. An initial estimate of the overal rotational correlation time, m, was obtained from the ratio of the trimmed mean values of 1/T2 and 1/ T1 and the program tmest. Model-Free Analysis of 15N Relaxation Data. The program ModelFree version 3.1 (35) was used to calculate dynamical parameters from the 15N T1 and T2 and NOE values for 138 of the 147 residues of GMH4CO, according to the "model-free" (20, 21) and "extended model-free" (36) formalism. Five different models were evaluated for each amide 1H-15N pair in the initial stages of analysis as described by Palmer and co-workers (37) with the following fitted parameters for each model: (1) S2, (2) S2 and e, (3) S2 and Rex, (4) S2, e, and Rex, and (5) Sf2, S2, and e. The N-H bond length was taken to be 1.02 Å, and a value of -160 ppm was used for the 15N chemical shift anisotropy (CSA). Initial model-free calculations which used uncertainties for the experimental values from Monte Carlo analysis of the exponential fits of T1 and T2 resulted in large sumsquared errors (SSEs) for many residues, even for models with three adjustable parameters (models 4 and 5), suggesting the possibility of errors in the measured relaxation values, underestimation of experimental uncertainties, or deviation from model spectral densities. Systematic errors in the measurement of 15N T2 values and their propagation into model-free analysis have been discussed elsewhere (38-40). Underestimation of T2 values

FIGURE 1: Amino acid sequences of G. dibranchiata monomeric globins and sperm whale myoglobin (SWMb). The sequences of the three GMG proteins (GMG2, GMG3, and GMG4) as well as the sequence (GMGx) used in refinement of Glycera monomeric hemoglobin crystal structures are shown and aligned with SWMb and the globin consensus numbering as in Bashford et al. (7). The location of helices in GMH4CO is shown above sequences with residue numbering according to the GMG4 sequence. The globin consensus numbering is shown below sequences. The D helix, missing in GMG proteins and some other members of the globin family, is shaded gray.

(the most likely systematic error) will result in the overestimation of m, and the subsequent overestimation of the generalized order parameter, S2. Recent measurements of the 15N CSA for ubiquitin (41) suggest it may vary significantly from the average of -160 ppm, which is generally used in analysis of 15N relaxation parameters. Because the CSA mechanism contributes significantly to the overall transverse and longitudinal 15N relaxation rates, especially at high field strengths, deviation of the CSA from the assumed value of -160 ppm will decrease the goodness of fit for model-free calculations. Table 1 shows the effect of variation in CSA for the 15N R1 and R2 and NOE values at 600 and 750 MHz for a typical N-H bond vector of GMH4CO. Variation of the CSA within the range observed for proteins will change the observed values of 1/T1 and 1/T2 at 750 MHz by up to 5%, significantly more than the experimental uncertainties of 1% for the 1/T1 and 1/T2 measurements obtained for this protein at that field strength from Monte Carlo simulations. To account for the variability in the 15N CSA and improve the model-free analysis of the 15N relaxation parameters for GMH4CO, the uncertainties for R1 and R2 at 750 MHz were set to 5% of their values. A similar approach has been described by Zhang et al. (42). Significantly lower SSE

values were obtained with model-free calculations as a result, as well as slightly increased uncertainties in the values of the fitted parameters. In addition, data for a number of residues that had initially required a two-parameter model (model 2 or 3) were now fitted adequately by the oneparameter model, model 1 (S2 only). Only one- and twoparameter fits (models 1-3) were used in the final modelfree analysis, as low errors (SSE < 15) were obtained for results from all residues but Leu2. Data from this residue were not adequately fitted with any of the five models. Determination of Amide Exchange Rates and Protection Factors. Amide H-D exchange decay curves were fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to a threeparameter single-exponential function with the program proFit 5.0.1 (Cherwell Scientific) to yield amide exchange rates (kobs). The program HXPRED was used to calculate intrinsic exchange rates (kint) from the primary protein sequence at pH 5.0 and 20 °C (43). Protection factors (P) were calculated with P ) kint/kobs.

the structure, including the heme cofactor and carbon monoxide ligand. The familiar globin fold is observed, with seven helices connected by six loops of various lengths. The D helix of the globin family is not present in GMH4CO (Figure 1), as with the R-chain of human hemoglobin (7). The protein backbone is well-defined throughout the structure of GMH4CO, although residues of the seven helices are slightly more ordered than the loops and turns, with average backbone rms deviations of 0.39 (helices) and 0.61 Å (all other nonterminal residues). The approximate locations of the seven helices in GMH4CO are indicated at the top of Figure 1. The precise extent of each helix (residues 4-17, 24-37, 39-45, 54-71, 78-92, 100-117, and 124-144) defined by the Procheck-NMR program (53) for the family of structures is found to correspond well to the definitions obtained previously from the chemical shift index and analysis of NOEs (residues 4-20, 24-37, 40-47, 55-73, 77-93, 102-120, and 125-147) (14). Most side chains which are not completely solvent-exposed are also highly ordered in the family of conformers, as reflected by an rmsd of 0.92 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms of the protein. The orientation of the heme cofactor in GMH4CO is reversed relative to that in myoglobin (12, 14). The position of the heme within the protein is defined very well, with an average rmsd from the mean for all non-hydrogen heme atoms of 0.50 Å. When the atoms of the propionate groups are excluded, the average heme heavy atom rmsd is 0.20 Å. While the CO ligand in the crystal structure of MbCO is

tilted by either 40 or 60° (44), in the carbon monoxy GMH crystal structure the ligand is nearly perpendicular to the heme plane and slighly displaced from the iron atom (18). Because there are no NMR spectroscopic constraints on the position of the CO ligand, distances taken from the MbCO crystal structure were used to fix its position, and the CO bond was taken to be normal to the plane of the heme as seen in the GMH crystal structure. A total of 2550 NOE and dihedral angle constraints (from quantitative J correlation) were used in the final refinement of the structure of GMH4CO, as summarized in Table 2. This corresponds to an average of 17 constraints per residue, while the actual distribution of constraints by residue is indicated in Figure 3A. Of the 201 constraints involving the heme cofactor, 158 are heme-protein NOEs identified in 2D and 3D heteronuclear edited and filtered NOESY experiments (14). Constraints between the heme and protein, which constitute more than 25% of the 618 long-range NOEs, are essential for positioning the heme cofactor within the protein and contribute significantly to determining the global fold of the protein. Of the 50 structures calculated in the final round of refinement, an ensemble of 29 conformers was selected for analysis, consisting of those for which no NOE constraint was violated by more than 0.2 Å and no dihedral constraint was violated by more than 2°. The average atomic coordinates of these 29 conformers were refined to regularize the structure, and Table 2 shows the final X-PLOR energies and

SAr is the refined average coordinates. b The X-PLOR Frepel function was used to simulate the van der Waals potential with atomic radii ranging from 0.9 times their CHARMM (50) values at high temperatures to 0.77 times their CHARMM values at low temperatures (32). c NOE-derived distance restraints were applied with a force constant of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2, using a soft square-well potential with a switching distance of 0.5 Å, an asymptote of 0.1, and a soft exponent of 1. d Dihedral angle constraints were given force constants of 200 kcal mol-1 rad-2 and applied at the beginning of the anneallingrefinement stage. e The Lennard-Jones potential was not used during refinement but was calculated after the final stage using nonbonded parameters from the PARMALLH6 parameter set. f No NOE constraints were violated by more than 0.2 Å, and no dihedral constraints were violated by more than 2° in the family of 29 conformers (accepted from a total of 50 calculated conformers).

structural statistics for both the family of structures and the refined average structure. The overall average rms deviations for the family from the average coordinates for the backbone (N, CR, and C) and all non-hydrogen atoms were 0.48 and 0.92 Å, respectively. The small residual violations of experimental constraints and covalent geometry, in addition to the small atomic rms deviations, reflect the quality of the calculated structures. A Ramachandran plot analysis of all 29 structures places 83% of non-glycine residues in the most favored regions, with only 1% in disallowed regions. Unusual or poorly defined backbone conformations in the loop regions preceding (72-78) and following (93-98) the F helix account for most of the residues found outside the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot.

Figure 3B shows the average backbone atomic rms deviations for each residue in GMH4CO, which are generally below 0.5 Å. Disordered regions include only the amino and carboxyl termini, and residues Gly74-Lys78, which connect the E and F helices. Slightly increased backbone rmsds are observed for residues of the CD loop (Ser48-Pro53), F helix, and FG loop (Met79-Ile98). The circular variances for the backbone ( and ) and side chain ( 1 and 2) torsion angles are shown in panels C and D of Figure 3, respectively. Increased rmsds and circular variances of the backbone atoms and dihedral angles are correlated in some instances. Both the backbone atom rmsd values (Figure 3B) and the  and  circular variances (Figure 3C) reflect the precision with which the backbone is defined in the structural ensemble, but the latter suggests clearly that three positions in the sequence display significant backbone angle heterogeneity: His72-Leu73, His97-Ile98, and Gly119-Gly120. These residues are located in the EF, FG, and GH loops, but only in the EF loop are markedly higher atomic rmsds observed (Figure 3B). In each instance, two conformational subclasses are observed within the structural ensemble which are related by a concerted change in the values of i and i+1. Table 3 shows the average  and  values for the residues in each conformer and the size of the subpopulation. Residues 119 and 120 are solvent-exposed glycines defined by relatively few experimental constraints (each has only one long-range NOE), and each can undergo a backbone rearrangement without significant displacement of the surrounding structure or violation of constraints. The other pairs of residues (His72-Leu73 and His97-Ile98) are located at opposite ends of the F helix. The 29 NMR solution conformers of GMH4CO are compared with the X-ray crystal structure of a mixture of GMH proteins (18) in Figure 3E. The solid line shows the CR rmsd at each residue between the ensemble of 29 solution conformers and the X-ray structure. The dashed line shows a similar comparison between the family of NMR structures and a model structure, which was constructed by substitution of the residues of GMH4CO into the crystal structure (6). Sizable differences between the NMR and X-ray structures are limited to the residues of the N and C termini and the AB, EF, and FG loops. It is interesting to note that the general profile of the rmsd plots resembles that of the crystallographic B-factors (dotted line). 15N Relaxation Measurements. Data from 138 of the 147 residues of GMH4CO were included in the analysis of 15N relaxation parameters and backbone dynamics. Overlap in

Some residues displayed larger than average 15N R2 values with a pronounced field dependence. Examples include Thr13, Lys96, Gly119, and most notably Asn95, which has R2 values of 19 and 23 s-1 at 600 and 750 MHz, respectively. These line-broadening effects are presumably

due to chemical exchange processes on the microsecond to millisecond time scale (vide infra). Model-Free Analysis.

of the overall molecular tumbling correlation time produced a value for m of 10.5 ns. Only one- and two-parameter fits (models 1-3) were used in the final analysis, with the choice between model 2 or 3 indicated by a non-zero value for either e in Figure 5C (model 2) or Rex in Figure 5D (model 3). For Leu2, the two-parameter models proved to be insufficient, but neither of the three-parameter models gave a significantly lower sum-squared error (SSE). Of the date from the 138 residues analyzed, 20 were fitted adequately by model 3, 14 by model 2, and 104 by model 1. Figure 5E shows the individual SSE values for all residues from the final modelfree calculation. The majority of residues of GMH4CO have high generalized order parameters (S2), as shown in Figure 5B, and very fast internal motions (e f 0). Significant internal mobility on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale appears to be confined to three regions of the protein; in addition to the residues of the N terminus, residues that have slower internal motions (e > 15 ps) are in the vicinity of the C helix and CD loop (residues 39, 40, 49-52, and 54). The first two residues of the C helix and the five residues preceding the start of the E helix, which were fitted adequately by model 2, display the lowest S2 values found in the protein (Figure 5B). Slightly reduced values of S2 (<0.85) also are observed for residues in other loop regions of GMH4CO (residues 75, 76, 99, and 123). In addition to the picosecond to nanosecond motions characterized by reduced S2 values and e values greater than 15 ps, residues involved in slow (microsecond to millisecond) time scale motions are those whose relaxation data are best fitted by model 3, which includes a chemical exchange term (Rex) to account for additional line broadening observed in T2 measurements. Because its effect on T2 scales with increasing field strength, the ability to discern the presence of chemical exchange broadening is significantly enhanced when T2 values at multiple fields are available. Many residues of the F helix have T2 values which scale with field strength and are therefore characterized by significant values of Rex (Figure 5D). This correlates well with the average backbone atomic rmsd, which is higher for the F helix than any other, as shown in Table 4. Residues that have slower motions of this type generally have normal S2 values; the average S2 values for the F helix are not significantly different from those in the other helices (Table 4). Hydrogen Exchange. All the helices of GMH4CO display significantly large amide protection (Figure 5A and Table 4). Residues in loops and at the start of each helix have

minimal protection factors, consistent with the absence of hydrogen bonding for those regions. The first three residues of the R-helix are not H-bonded to backbone oxygens, and since the C helix extends only two turns, significant protection of only about four amide hydrogens is expected. Therefore, the lower average protection factor of the C helix relative to the others is consistent with the pattern of hydrogen bonding in the calculated structures, and does not necessarily reflect dynamic instability. The NH groups of two side chains display large protections factors. The H1 of His90 and the H 1 of Trp130 are observed in all the 2D HSQC spectra of the H-D exchange series. Both of these exchanged too slowly over the time course (13 days) to allow fitting of their decays, suggesting that they are also involved in hydrogen bonds. Inspection of the family of conformers reveals that both the side chain H1 and backbone HN of His90 are hydrogen-bonded to the main chain carbonyl of Val86. It also appears that the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Val10 is the most likely hydrogen bond acceptor for the Trp130 side chain H 1. Table 5 summarizes the average distances for these side chain,,,main chain hydrogen bonds. DISCUSSION The solution structure of the monomeric hemoglobin component IV-carbon monoxide complex (GMH4CO) is very precise, with most backbone and internal side chain atomic rms deviations from the average structure of less than 0.5 Å. The position of the heme cofactor is well defined by a large number (158) of heme-protein NOE constraints. Heme Pocket Description. Structural features of the proximal side of the heme are highlighted in Figure 6A which includes the heme cofactor, carbon monoxide ligand, and surrounding side chains. Important heme-protein interactions include the coordinate-covalent bond between the proximal histidine (His90) side chain and the heme iron, the His90,,,Val86 hydrogen bonds, the hydrogen bonds between the Arg89 and Tyr93 side chains and the heme propionate of the D pyrrole (18). While providing the only covalent link between heme and protein, the side chain of the proximalhistidine forms a hydrogen bond directly with the F helix backbone which serves both to stabilize the position of the ligand side chain and couple the structure and dynamics of the heme pocket to the entire F helix. In the globin family consensus, the negatively charged D propionate normally forms a salt bridge to a basic residue (usually Lys) at the FG1 position (7), where Tyr93 is found in GMH4CO (Figure 1).

Volkman et al. lack of NOE constraints involving the ring protons, the side chain of Tyr93 is surprisingly well-ordered in the calculated structures. Its position in the structure is determined through NOEs to the H protons and a 1 dihedral angle constraint obtained from quantitative J correlation measurements of the 3J 3 H -C and JH -N couplings (14). Few unambiguous NOEs to the propionates could be obtained, since they fall in a highly degenerate region of the 1H spectrum and could not be resolved by heteronuclear editing because the heme was not labeled with 13C. This resulted in a wide range of rotamer states for the propionates in the family of conformers. Because neither the Tyr93 ring nor the heme propionates are well-defined, the average heme O1-Tyr93 O distance (5.7 Å) in the ensemble of NMR structures is greater than that (2.5 Å) observed in the crystal structure. Despite this lack of precision, the general orientation of Tyr93 is still consistent with the formation of a hydrogen bond to the heme. Figure 6B shows the distal heme environment, including four hydrophobic residues that surround the CO ligand creating an unusually apolar binding pocket. Two of these residues are ones that distinguish this protein from the globin family consensus, Leu58 (E7, normally the distal histidine, found in 97% of globin sequences) and Phe31 (B10, leucine with 90% frequency) (7). The other two are Phe45, which is completely conserved in all globins, and Val62, which is also highly conserved. These residues and the heme combine to completely isolate the ligand binding site from solvent access, and are themselves essentially buried in the interior of the protein, with only the heme propionate carboxylates having any solvent-exposed surface area. Lys61, whose N atom is an average of 4.6 Å from a D propionate oxygen in the family of conformers (not shown), may be involved in a salt bridge, similar to the D propionate-Arg89 salt bridge on the proximal side. Comparison of GMH4CO and a Related X-ray Structure. The crystals used in the X-ray structure determination were grown from protein isolated from the natural source which was known to be a mixture of isoforms (18). Recent mass spectrometric analysis has shown that these crystals contained a mixture of the three major monomeric forms, for which sequences are known (15), as well as a number of uncharacterized minor forms (16). Furthermore, the protein sequence used in refining the crystal structures has a calculated molecular mass different from those of all of the species observed by mass spectrometry (17). The 11 amino acid differences between the sequence of GMG4 and that used in refining the crystal structure are highlighted with bold letters in Figure 1. The most notable difference is at the B10 position where GMG4 has Phe (whereas GMGx has Leu). This indicates that GMG4 was not the dominant component of the monomeric fraction used for crystallization. The positions of the two side chain types, which are compared in Figure 6B, have the same general orientation. Conformational disorder was described for the B10 leucine in the deoxy and CO-ligated crystal structures, and the map was interpreted in terms of multiple 2 rotamer populations (18, 45). Since this space can accommodate the larger side chain of a phenylalanine, as in the GMH4CO structure described here, the rotational disorder of the smaller leucine side chain is not surprising. It is also interesting to note that, of the four distal side chains shown in Figure 6B, the side chain of Phe31 makes the closest contact with the

position (which is usually leucine in the globin family) may compensate for the missing FG1 lysine. Unfortunately, no long-range NOEs define the orientation of the positively charged side chain of Arg89; this makes it difficult to determine whether it interacts with the negatively charged D propionate of the heme. In the refined average structure, these carboxylate and guanidinyl groups are within 6 Å of each other, however. Aromatic resonances of the Tyr93 side chain were not observed in any of the NMR spectra. This suggests that the signals are broadened by chemical exchange (ring flipping) on an intermediate time scale (14). Despite the complete

Views from front and rear are shown, with helices and termini labeled.

CO ligand, whereas in the crystal structure, the slight displacement of the CO from a ideal coordination geometry was found to be mediated by van der Waals contact with the methyl groups of Val62 and Leu58. This is consistent with the idea that Phe31 contributes to the unusual ligand binding properties of this protein. Most of the other amino acid differences may also be explained in terms of the sequence variability among the components of the monomeric hemoglobin fraction. Only Ala57 and the three glutamines at positions 40, 82, and 101 in the crystal structure are not represented in at least one of the sequenced components. The glutamines are likely all glutamic acid residues which could not be identified unambiguously by either chemical sequencing, amino acid analysis, or refinement of the electron density. The completely solvent-exposed side chain of residue 57 was not observed in the electron density, and alanine was substituted during refinement; residue 57 may actually be an aspartate or glutamate with a high degree of 2 rotational disorder, as in the NMR structure (Figure 3D). Despite the differences in the protein sequences studied by crystallography and NMR, the resulting structures are very similar. The average backbone rms deviations from the X-ray crystal structure for both the family of 29 GMH4CO conformers and the refined average structure are slightly larger than the variation within the family of NMR structures (Table 2). Aside from the termini, differences in the backbone conformations of the NMR and crystal structures are confined to a few small regions between helices (Figure 2E). Differences of 3 Å between the NMR and crystal structures are observed for the CR atoms of Gly19 and Ser20. These residues are part of a well-defined reverse turn formed in both structures by residues 18-21 at the end of the A helix. The discrepancy may be related to the substitution of Ser20 in GMH4CO for Ala20 in the crystal structure (Figure 1); however, in neither case does this solvent-exposed side chain appear to contact any other part of the structure. Tertiary interactions through which conformational perturbations could be transmitted to these residues include the

conserved Asp21-Arg117 and Asp16-Lys121 salt bridges, but no clear indication of this type of long-range effect is observed in the structural comparison. Whereas the backbone rmsds of residues 18-21 are generally low (Figure 3B), a few residues in this region of the structure (Thr13, Ala18, Gly19, Ala24, and Gly119) display evidence of slow motions (Rex) (Figure 5D), and residues Gly119 and Gly120 were noted for displaying significant backbone heterogeneity in the familiy of NMR structures (Figure 3C and Table 3). The relative positioning of these residues in the structure of GMH4CO is highlighted in Figure 7. Perhaps the crystal structure represents one of two or more conformers that interchange on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Larger differences between the NMR and crystal structures are observed at the EF and FG loops. These residues display conformational heterogeneity in the NMR structure (Table 3), and they also have the highest B-factors in the crystal structure (Figure 3E). Residues Val70 and Leu73 of the EF loop make hydrophobic contacts with the A helix in which residues 10 and 12 are different in GMG4 and GMGx (Figure 1). Interestingly, for residues 72 and 73, the model of GMH4CO derived from the crystal structure (6) is much closer to the conformation found in the NMR structure than is the crystal structure, as indicated by the difference between the solid and dashed lines of Figure 3E. This may reflect a slight change in the packing of the end of the E helix against the A helix as a result of the change from Ile10 in the crystal structure to Val10 in GMH4CO. A similar scenario could be envisioned for the interaction of the FG loop with nearby residues of the BC loop, where His39 and Asp40 both differ from the sequence of the crystal structure; however, no corresponding perturbation in the FG loop is observed in the model structure. Internal dynamics may be a factor in the differences between the NMR and crystal structures for the residues in and around the F helix, as discussed below. The NMR and X-ray structures differ in regard to one instance of side chain,,,main chain hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bond donors are revealed by H-D exchange measurements, but the identity of the acceptor must be deduced from examination of the calculated structures.

10918 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 31, 1998 While the pair of His90,,,Val86 hydrogen bonds on the proximal side of the heme (Figure 6A) is consistent with previous crystal structures, the Trp130,,,Val10 H bond observed here is not consistent with an earlier report of a H bond between the side chain of Trp130 and the side chain O1 of Thr13 (17). As indicated in Table 5, while the Trp130 N 1,,,Thr13 O1 distance (2.97 Å) is reasonable, the H,,,O distance (2.89 Å) indicates that the geometry of this potential H bond is very poor compared to that of the Trp130,,,Val10 arrangement. If this represents a real structural rearrangement, the substitution of Val10 for Ile10 could be a contributing factor. Backbone Dynamics of GMH4CO. The overall molecular tumbling correlation time (m) is an important parameter in the analysis of internal dynamics. All model-free 15N-1H dynamics calculations were performed with the assumption of an isotropic m, estimated initially from an average T1/T2 ratio to be 10.3 ns and globally optimized in the final modelfree analysis to be 10.5 ns. GMH4CO has a moderately nonspherical shape; the three principal components of the inertia tensor for GMH4CO calculated from the refined average NMR structure are 3.39 × 106, 4.70 × 106, and 5.96 × 106 Da Å-2. It is possible that the model-free analysis would be improved by the inclusion of an anisotropic diffusion tensor and that some residues that showed better fits to the model that included contributions to T2 from chemical exchange (Rex, model 3) would then be characterized adequately by model 1 or 2. However, the inclusion of 15N T2 data at two field strengths makes it unlikely that the large Rex terms required in the vicinity of the F helix are completely artifactual, since some of these residues (Asn95 and Lys96) display large, field-dependent transverse relaxation rates (Figure 4B,C). Trends observed in the model-free analysis of NMR relaxation can be correlated with a number of features of the NMR structures. Figure 7 shows the structure of GMH4CO with Rex contributions highlighted in varying shades (white f magenta f blue) to indicate increasing values of Rex. The lower precision of the F helix in the NMR structure (Figure 3B and Table 4) correlates with the number of its residues that exhibit motion on the slow time scale (magenta) in Figure 7. The locations of residue pairs with backbone dihedral angle heterogeneity (Figure 3C and Table 3) are also indicated in Figure 7. Asn95 has the largest Rex term (colored blue in Figure 7) and is situated between Tyr93, suspected of having ring-flipping dynamics in the intermediate exchange regime, and the  and  heterogeneity of His97-Ile98. The residues in and following the C helix have reduced S2 values (Figure 5B) and slightly larger rmsds (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3E, the crystallographic B-factors have a profile similar to the rmsds between the NMR and X-ray structures. In contrast to some other comparisons of NMR relaxation-based backbone order parameters with crystallographic B-factors (42, 46), high B-factors correlate here with regions of GMH4CO that have either lower order parameters (enhanced picosecond to nanosecond time scale internal motion) or significant Rex factors (microsecond to millisecond time scale motion). Either type of internal motion may be expected to contribute to higher crystallographic thermal factors (42, 46). The C helix and residues between the E and F helices, which have lower order

Volkman et al. parameters (Figure 5B), have correspondingly higher Bfactors (Figure 3E). Residues Asn95 and Lys96 have the largest crystallographic B-factors in this protein, and exhibit similarly large Rex contributions in solution (Figure 5D). Interestingly, unlike most residues of the F helix, residues 86-88 have no Rex contributions and display low B-factors. Slow Motions of the F Helix. The F helix amide protons of sperm whale myoglobin, which are structurally similar to those of GMH4, have very low protection factors (S. N. Loh, personal communication). This is, however, clearly not the case for the F helix of GMH4CO, whose protection factors are similar to those of the other seven R-helices (Figure 5A). At the same time, the combined results of the model-free analysis of 15N relaxation data and structure calculations suggest that the F helix does have significant internal mobility, most likely on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. These motions may involve the helix as a rigid unit, rather than local unfolding events, to preserve the large protection factors over the entire length of the F helix. While a direct correlation between the dynamic and structural data is not warranted, the presence of localized disorder in the ensemble of calculated structures at each end of the F helix provides an example of a possible mechanism for this type of concerted motion. The lack of an Rex contribution at Gly87 coincident with a minimum in the X-ray structure B-factors in the middle of the F helix seems to conflict with this interpretation. However, this could be explained by a model for F helix motion in which both ends pivot about a stationary point corresponding to the residues that lack the dynamic behavior of the surrounding regions. The exchange broadening of the ring protons of Tyr93 also could be accommodated by a model that postulates slow motions in the F helix. Implications for Ligand Binding Kinetics. A large number of residues contact the heme in GMH4CO, forming both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. However, the coordinate-covalent bond between the side chain of His90 and the heme iron is the strongest single link between the protein and its cofactor. As a result, motions originating from the F helix can be expected to influence the heme environment to some degree. At this point, the motions of the F helix observed in this study cannot be correlated directly to the kinetics of ligand association-dissociation. Quantitative characterization of the time scales of these motions with measurements of 15N T1F (47, 48) values in GMH4CO, analysis of dynamics of other liganded forms (deoxy, O2, and CN-), and comparisons with myoglobin, GMH4 mutants, and other related proteins will permit a more meaningful comparison with association and dissociation rates. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. Andrew Lee, Dr. David LeMaster, and Dr. Arthur Palmer for helpful discussions and Dr. Jane Caldwell for generously providing software tools for structure refinement. We also thank Dr. Ed Mooberry and other members of the NMRFAM staff for their gracious help. REFERENCES
