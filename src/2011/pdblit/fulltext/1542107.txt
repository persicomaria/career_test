1. INTRODUCTION Calbindin Dgk is one of the smallest members of the calmodulin superfamily of calcium binding proteins. It is composed of two helix-loop-helix calcium binding subdomains, also called EF-hands [I]. These two EFhands subdomains associate to form a very stable fourhelix bundle. It has been observed for the vast majority of this class of proteins that these calcium binding units occur in pairs; calbindin D,,, has one pair; calmodulin has two pairs; etc.. We wished to examine the properties of the individual EF-hand subdomains of calbindin Dgk in order to gain an understanding of their individual contributions to the structure and function of the intact protein. Studies on fragments of proteins have been shown to be useful in determining their contribution to the structure, folding and function of the intact proteins. In order to obtain sufficient quantities of the desired fragments, we have devised a method for cleaving the protein specifically at a chosen point between the two subdomains. Since the protein contains no internal me* Originally presented at the Seventh International Symposium on

thionine residues, one can be introduced and used as a target for cleavage by CNBr. By substituting Met for Pro at position 43 and cleaving, this procedure yields two fragments designated Fl, residues l-43, and F2, residues 44-75. In this way, the fragments can be prepared in large quantities without resorting to expressioll and purification of the individual subdomains in E. colt' where the yield could be quite low, or to solid-phase peptide synthesis which could prove a difficult task in the case of large peptides. This method could potentially be applied to the production of fragments from many small proteins with few or no methionine residues. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.I. Ahtugrrwsis aridprolelrr produclbrr
Mutagcncsis and cxprcssion of calbindin DVkwere performed as described previously [2,3] using an oligonucleolide cassette having the desired CCG to ATG codon change. The protein was purified according to the modified procedure described by Chazin et al. [4] in order to avoid dcamidalion of the protein.
250 mg of the P43M protein was dissolved in 30 ml 80% lrifluoroacetic acid. 3 g CNBr was added and the solution was cooled on ice while Na was bubbled through it. The solution was left at room temperature for 20 h after which it was evaporated csing a Buchi Rotavapor. The sample was redissolved in 150ml of5 mM EDTA and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 using I M Tris-base (final concentralion of Tris was 24 mM). The solution was then pumped onto a 3.2 x 17 cm DEAE-Sephacel column pre-cquilibrakd in IO mM Tris-HCI, I mM EDTA, pi-l 7.5. The applied sample waselukd with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.05 M to 0.30 M. Fragment Fl will clutc in the loading wash under tbese conditions while fragment F:! will be retarded more than intact calbindin.

3. RESULTS In order to examine the individual calcium binding subdomains of calbindin Dgk, it was necessary to produce the protein fragments in high yield. A cleavage point in the loop connecting the two subdomains was desired so that the perturbation to the structure of the individual helix-loop-helix subdomains would be minimal. Trypsin digestion was attempted first but gave too many products. CNBr was then selected since a unique cleavage point could be designed by inserting a methionine to serve as the target for the CNBr. Pro43 was chosen as the residue to replace with Met because it is one of the residues in the loop (residues 36 to 43) between the two subdomains and because by removing this proline, the observed conformational heterogeneity associated with the cis-truns isomerizetion of Prod3 [S] would be avoided. However, the choice of this residue introduced a problem for the cleavage reaction. In case where residues having hydroxyl side-chains (serine and threonine) lie immediately after the bond to be cleaved, the reaction efficiency is reduced under the conditions normally used, 70% formic acid and a 100:1 ratio of CNBr to methionine [6]. In the case of calbindin DYL, the serine at position 44 presented such a problem. In order to improve the reaction efficiency, 80% trifluoroacetic acid and a ratio of 1000:1 CNBr/meTable I Properties of fragments of calbindin DVk Fragment Fl Residues' Molecular weight (Da) Net chargct EF-hand charge' KG, (M-l) k,, (s-l) l-43 4850 -1 -2 8x105 c3 Fragment F2 44-75 3650 -B -4 2X10' 38

thionine was used. Under these conditions only approximately 17% of the protein remained uncleaved. The ability of the purified fragments to associate was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. la, with calcium present, a third band not corresponding to the individual Fl or F2 fragments is observed. This is most likely a heterodimer of the Fl and F2 fragments since it migrates at the same position as the intact protein. This result demonstrates the formation of a dimer similar to the intact protein. In the absence of calcium (Fig. lb), any dimerization of the fragments is too weak to be observed with this method. In both cases, the remainder of the fragments not involved in heterodimer formation migrate as expected based on their charges (Table I). The structures of the fragments were compared to that of the intact protein by examination of their onedimensional `H NMR spectra. Fig, 2a and b show the spectra of the dimer of Fl and F2 and uncleaved P43M protein in the presence of calcium. The differences between the two spectra are very small and indicate that the structure of the protein is largely unaffected by the cleavage of the peptide bond at Met43. As can be seen in Fig. 2c and d, the structural differences between the intact and cleaved protein are also minimal in the absence of calcium indicating that dimers are formed under these conditions.

Binding of calcium stabilizes the Fl-F2 dimer through a combination of neutralization of the negative charges and, possibly, by inducing a conformation more favorable to dimerization. Electrostatic interactions also play a role in the calcium binding properties as has been demonstrated in the case of the intact protein [IO,111.This is also true for the fragments. The calcium off-rate is lower in Fl than in F2 as is the on-rate. This is consistent with the lower charge of Fl versus F2 (Table I). These rates may also be influenced by the lower stability of the individual fragments as compared to the intact protein. Studies are in progress to address this issue. In summary, it is possible to use a combination of mutagenesis and chemical cleavage to isolate specific protein subdomains in high yield. This method should prove useful for studies related to the structure and function of the protein from which the fragments are derived.

NMR studies of the fragments also indica.te few changes in the structure of the FI-F2 heterodimer compared to the intact protein (J. Ktirdel, unpllblished results). The calcium binding behavior of the fragments was determined by titration of the fragments with CaC& and observation of the shifts and linewidths of the aromatic sidechain protons by `H NMR as used previously to characterize the intact protein [33.As shown in Table I, the binding constants are several orders of magnitude lower than those reported for the corresponding sites in intact calbindin Dgk. These binding constants were confirmed by microcalorimetric studies (data not shown). 4. DISCUSSION The results presented above indicate that the two calcium binding subdomains largely retain their structure after cleavage of the loop separating them. As shown by the lack of change in the NMR spectra, the structure of the Fl-F2 dimer is essentially identical to that of the intact protein. Clearly the major force holding the two subdomains together in their specific orientation is not the covalent linkage between them but noncovalent forces at the interface of the two subdomains. As shown in Fig 3, the interior of the intact protein is made up entirely of hydrophobic residues. This large area of hydrophobic contact, which is buried upon association of the two subdomains, bestows on calbindin Dgk a large conformational stability as has been observed previously [S].
