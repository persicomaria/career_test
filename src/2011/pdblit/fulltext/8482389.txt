Ten resonances in the 270 MHz proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of human carbonic anhydrase C, which are ascribed to hnidazole C<2~protons, have been studied as a function of pH, and in the presence of iodide, cyanide and hexaeyanochromate. Similar measurements have also been made on the enzyme after replacement of the native Zn 2+ ion with paramaagnetic Co2 +. Used in conjunction with the crystal structure and with the results obtained from a slmliar study on the human B isoenzyme (Campbell e~ a/., 1974), these studies have enabled the assignment of a number of the resonances to specific histidine residues in the protein. I n particular, resonances have been assigned to the three histidines liganded to the zinc ion and to His63 which is located in the active site. The titration behaviour of these residues is discussed in relation to various theories t h a t have been advanced to explain the elusive enzyme mechanism. Linewidth measurements show that apparent rate constants for D + transfer from histidines in the active site and on the surface of the human C enzyme are appro~mately 3)< 104 s -~ at p H 7, 25~ and a protein concentration of 3 m~. This is an order of magnitude faster than the rate observed in the human B isoenzyme under the same conditions.

1. I n t r o d u c t i o n
Kinetic studies of m a m m a l i a n carbonic anhydrases (EC 4.2.1.1.) reveal t h a t the ionization of a group with a p K a around 7 is essential for the enzymic interconversion of CO~ and H C O s - (Lindskog et al., 1971). I n spite of X - r a y crystellographie studies to a resolution of 2 · (Lijlss e~ cd., 1972; K a n n a n e/a/., 1975; Vaars, 1974) and complete amino acid sequences (Andersson ~ al., 1972; Henderson et a/., 1973) the identity of this ionizable group on the enzyme remains in dispute. The two m a i n contenders for the group are a zinc-co-ordinated water molecule (see, for example, Liudskog & Coleman, 1973) and the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (see, for example, Pecker & Storm, 1968; Appleton & Sarkar, 1974). W e h a v e shown in a previous p a p e r (Campbell e$ a/., 1974) t h a t high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance can be used to s t u d y the behaviour of histidine residues in the h u m a n B isoenzyme.

residues did not show the characteristic behaviour of the essential group. I n this paper, we extend this s t u d y to the h u m a n C enzyme in an a t t e m p t to clarify further the precise nature of the - n h n o w n ionization. A comparison of the behaviour of the high activity class (e.g. h u m a n C) and the low activity class (e.g. h u m a n B) of enzymes is also of interest. :Further speculation about the catalytic mechanism of carbonic anhydrase arises from the v e r y high turnover rates observed for these enzymes. Depending on whether H C O s - or H2CO.q is considered to be the substrate in the dehydration reaction, the diffusion rates of either proton to enzyme or H2COs to enzyme would appear to be m u c h faster t h a n the rates observed in other systems. Tt has been pointed out, however, t h a t ff account is t a k e n to buffering species in solution the required proton transfer rates are not impossibly high (Kha]ifah, 1973; Lindskog & Coleman, 1973; Prince & Wooley, 1973). No such plausible explanation has been presented for the postulated H2COs substrate (Koenig & Brown, 1972). I t is difficult to test the hypothesis of buffer-mediated proton transfer using conventional kinetic methods since buffer m u s t normally be used for the measurements. However, we have shown t h a t n.m.r, t methods can be used to measure proton transfer rates (Campbell e~ al., 1974), and t h a t the presence of buffer increases these rates. I t is of interest to see if these rates are different in the high and low activity classes of enzymes. 2. M a t e r i a l s a n d M e t h o d s (a) Enzymes and ~hemic~l~ Human carbonic anhydrase C was prepared by the method of Henderson & Henriksson (1973) and stored as a suspension in ammonium sulphate. Prior to its use in the n.m.r. experiments, the native enzyme was dialyzed against 1 mM-1,10-phenanthroline at p H 7 for 48 h to remove residual impurities of paramagnetic ions and freeze-dried from D20. The apoenzyme was prepared b y dialysing the native enzyme for 10 days against 0.1 Macetate buffer, p H 5.3, containing 10mM-l,10-phenanthroline, and subsequently dialysing against frequent changes of doubly glass-distilled water (Lindskog & Nyman, 1964). The cobalt enzyme was prepared by addition of one equivalent of CoSO4 to the apocnzyme, adjustment of the p H to 7, and dialysis ~gainst water. Potassium hexacyanochromate, KsCr(CN)8 supplied b y Alpha Inorganics (Ventron) Ltd, was filtered and recrystallized before use. All other chemicals were obtained as Analar grade and use without further purification.

The enzyme concentration used throughout Was 3 mM. This was checked spectrophotometrically at 280 n m taking a molar absorption coefficient of 56,000 ~ - z cm -x (Nyman & Lindskog, 1964). Dilute solutions of D=SO4 and NaOD were used to ,adjust the p H of the samples and the ionic strength was maintained at 0.1 unit using Na2SO4. For the p H titratious, 2 stock stolutions of protein were prepared, one at high and t Abbreviation used: n.m.r., nuclear magnetic resonance.

The pH was measured using an Activion combination electrode incorporating a K2SO4 salt bridge. All values o f p H quoted in this paper correspond to the uncorrected meter reading, denoted pH*. N.m.r. spectra were recorded at 270 lVIHz using a Bruker spectrometer with an Oxford Instrument Co. superconducting magnet. The mode of operation and the techniques used have been described previously (Campbell et aL, 1974). All measurements were recorded at 254- l~ Chemical shift values are reported as parts per m~ll~on (p.p.m.) downfield from sodium 2,2-d~methyl-2-sllapentane-5-sulphonate.

3. Results

(a) pH tCtr~io~s
Figure 1 illustrates the aromatic region of the 270 Ml~z n.m.r, spectrum of h u m a n carbonic anhydrase C. Individual resonances from the imidazole Cc2) protons of histidine residues are generally observed in the region 7-5 to 9-0 p.p.m. Resonances from single N H protons which are slow to exchange with the deuterated solvent also occur in this part of the spectrum but t h e y are comparatively broad (Campbell et aL, 1974). B y plotting the shift positions of the imidazole protons as a function of pH*, characteristic titration curves m a y be obtained which reflect the degree of ionization of the imidazole ring (see, for example, Cohen, 1972). A total of ten resonances observed in the aromatic region of the spectrum were selected for study and, of these, seven titrate in the manner characteristic ofimidazole 0(2) protons. The remaining three do not titrate in the normal way, b u t their behaviour in the presence of anions and with changing pH* closely resembles t h a t of the non-titrating resonances observed in the human B isoenzyme, all of which have been assigned to imldazole C(2) protons (Campbell et al., 1974). These resonances have been given the labels 1 to 3 in the Figures to match the labelling of their counterparts in the B enzyme. The titrateablc resonances are numbered 4 to 10. The titration behaviour of the ten resonances is shown under a variety of conditions in Figures 2 to 5, and the measured p K a values are listed in Table 1. Because the spectra of the C enzyme are particularly well resolved, the shift positions of the titratahle 0(4~ proton resonances also m a y be obtained either directly from the normal spectra or b y using difference methods (Fig. l(e)). The titration curves for these have been plotted in some cases. The difference in chemical shift between the protonated and non-protonated forms of histidine for the C(4) resonance is approximately half t h a t of the C(2) resonance and thus t h e y are easily distinguishable. Curves obtained for the native enzyme in the absence of iuhibitors are shown in Figure 2. The observation of seven titrateable Cc2) resonances is consistent with the n.m.r, results obtained at 220 ~[Hz (Cohen et aL, 1972). Resonance 1 is relatively broad throughout the entire pH* range and it becomes di~cult to follow below p H 6. Resonance 2 is only observed above p H 8. Four of the titration curves (7, 8, 9, !0), have pK~ values between 6.5 and 7.4; these are of particular interest since the activity]int:ed group in the carbonic anhydrases is known to have a P ~ a around neutrality. I n the presence of the inhibitory anions I - and CN- (Figs 3 and 4, respectively) four of these resonances are perturbed quite specifically. With 20 raM-iodide, resonances 1 and 2 become clearly observable throughout the entire p H range; additionally, resonance 1 is shifted upfield from its normal position b y about 0-2 p.p.m, at low p H *

Of the titrateable resonances, only 10 is affected appreciably. I n this case the chemical shift between the fully protonated and fully non-protonated forms is reduced from 1 p.p.m, to about 0.8 p.p.m, and the p K a value increases from 7.12 to 7.30.

For resonance 2 and to a lesser extent 3 it can be seen that the positions of the chemical shift inflections present in both cases are shifted to higher pH* values with increasing concentrations of iodide. This observation parallels the behaviour of the non-titrateable resonances studied in the human B isoenzyme (see Fig. 5(b)). The titration behaviour of resonance 10 a]s0

shows a dependence on iodide concentration but the effect is more complex. As stated previously, the pKa of resonance 10 increases to a value of 7.30 in the presence of 20 m~-iodide; it can be seen, however, t h a t higher concentrations do not increase it further. A p H * titration taken after substitution of the zinc atom by paramagnetic cobalt produces the curves shown in Figure 6. Clearly the four resonances which are sensitive to the presence of anionic ~nh~bitors have been shifted and/or broadened to the extent t h a t they are no longer detectable. The remaining resonances correspond to those observed for the native enzyme, but with the exception of resonance 7 they are all subject to a slight shift; resonances 8 and 9 are shifted b y approximately 0"1 p.p.m. to low field, while resonances 4, 5 and 6 are shifted b y about the same amount to high field. The shifted resonances are all broadened b y a few hertz relative to their linewidths in the native enzyme. No appreciable line broadening is apparent for resonance 7 however.

(b) L/n~afidth~ It has been shown that the linewidths of the titrating histidine C(2) proton resonances in the B enzyme are made up from a contribution from exchange, which is pH* dependent and from an inherent linewidth which is approximately independent of pH* (Campbell e~ a~., 1974). Using the same procedures for the C enzyme, the inherent Iinewidths of the seven titrating histidine resonances were measured, and all were found to be within the range 44-2 Hz. Unlil~e the B enzyme, the lines do not broaden very much at the pK a value of the parent histidine; nevertheless, it is still possible to measure the exchange contribution in certain cases, and for resonances 7 and 10, which have pK a values around 7, the measured exchange contribution to both is 34-1 Hz. Dilution of the enzyme solution by a factor of four apparently increases this exchange contribution to 5-t-2 Hz. Pseudo-first-order raCe constants for I) § transfer between the histidine residues and the D20 medium may be obtained from the observed exchange contributions

to the linewidths (Campbell et ~., 1974). Values of 3.8· s -1 and 2 - 2 · ~ s -~ are obtained for the concentrated and dilute enzyme solutions, respectively. As was the case for the B enzyme, the linewidths of the non-titrating resonances 1, 2 and 3 become smaller with increasing pH* and/or anion concentration. For example, resonance 1 has a linewidth of 22 Hz at pH* 6 which gradually decreases to 10 Hz at pH* 9. This resonance is noticeably broader than the equivalent resonance in the B enzyme at most pH* values.

(c) addition, o.t"Or(ON)~The paramagnetic hexaoyanochromate anion has been used previously to produce selective line broadening in protein spectra (Campbell et aL, 1973,1974). By subtraction of the broadened spectrum from the original, unperturbed one, it is possible to obtain a much simplified spectrum conts.lnlng only theresonances of those nuclei near the binding site of the anion. In the case of the human B isoenzyme, the binding position of Cr(CN)s- was not known with certainty but the n.m.r, spectra provided strong evidence of binding in the active site crevice of the protein. Addition of Cr(CN)s - to a solution of the human C enzyme at pH* 5.8 produces the paramagnetie differences spectra shown in Figure 7. I t can be seen that only one of the eight imldazole proton resonances observable at this pH* is not affected by the paramagnetic ion.

Discussion

A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the human B and human C carbonic anhydrases (Andersson e~ a~., 1972; Henderson eta/., 1973) shows 59~/o homology between the two forms, and the crystal structures have many common features (Kannan e~ al., 1975). The B enzyme contains 11 histidine residues, the C enzyme 12. The positions of six of these are conserved in the two sequences. Three of the conserved histidines at positions 93 (94)t, 95 (96)and 118 (119) are known to be liganded to the zinc ion. Of the remainder, Hisl06 (107) is located about 7 A from the metal and involved in a complex hydrogen-bonded structure. ~i~121 (122) is buried in the interior of the molecule and His63 (64) is located in the active site crevice. The remaining six histidines in the C enzyme are all situated on the surface of the molecule. Five of these surface residues occur near the N-terminus which is placed over the "mouth" of the active site crevice; these are at positions 2, 3, 9, 14 and 16 in the sequence. The sixth surface histidine at position 35 is on the opposite side of the molecule and the imidazole C(2~proton is about 26 A from the metal ion. The locations of all 12 histidines in the C enzyme structure are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated schematically in Figure 8. Turning to the n.m.r, results, we first consider the three non-titrating resonances numbered 1 to 3 in the Figures. As we noted previously, the pH* dependence of the chemical shifts of these resonances in the presence of inhibitory anions is very similar to that observed for the three non-titrating Cr proton resonances studied in the B enzyme. This is readily seen by comparing Figure 5(a) and (b) which shows this

pH* dependence as a function of iodide concentration for both sets of resonances in the C and B enzymes, respectively. Particularly noticeable in each case is the shift to high pH* with increasing anion concentrations of the ~nflection in the chemical shift of resonance 2.

In the B enzyme, this feature was shown to parallel changes in the apparent p K a of the group controll~ug the enzymic activity, and a p e a value of approximately 7"5 was obtained for this ionization in the absence of ~n]~bitory anions. According to the available ~netic data (Khalifah, 1971) the corresponding ionization in the human C enzyme should occur at lower pH, a fact which is supported by our measurements on the esterase activity of the enzyme (Fig. 9) which indicate a pKs value of 7.1 for the

I t is of interest to see if these P ~ a values are reflected in our n.m.r, data for the C enzyme. Unfortunately, resonance 2, which exhibits most clearly the pH*-dependent effects already described, is not observed in the absence of inhlbitors at most p H * values so an accurate p K a for the activityollul~ed inflection is difficult to obtain in this case. However, the p H * dependence of resonance 3 and of resonance 2 in the presence of different concentrations of iodide indicate a p K a value close to 7.0 for the native enzyme, a result which is consistent with the kluetic data. Moreover, in the presence of 20 raM-I- this value is increased to about 7.7 in reasonable agreement with the esterase activity measurements.

In view of the great simil~ity in the behaviour of the non-titrating resonances in the two enzyme species and particularly with respect to the activity-linked ionization, it is likely that they correspond to functionally identical groups. In the B enzyme these resonances were assigned to imidazole Cr protons of the three histidines liganded to the zinc ion. Using the same assignment for the C enzyme, resonance 1 corresponds to Hisll8, resonance 2 to His93 and resonance 8 to His95. The effect of Zn(II) binding on the chemical shift ofimidazole Cr proton resonances is known to be a displacement to low field, the magnitude of the shift apparently being dependent on the nature of the complex formed. For instance, Wang & Li (1966) measured a displacement of 0.45 p.p.m, for the Cr proton in a 4:1 complex of imidazole with Zn(II) in dimcthyl sulphoxide, l~Iore recently, Appleton & Sarkar (1974) reported a shift to low field of more than 0.6 p.p.m, on binding 4,4'-bisimidazolylmethane to Zn(H) in aqueous solution. In accord with the observations made in these model studies, all three resonances attributed to the ligand histidines in the C enzyme occur to low field of the position normally expected for an imidazole Cr proton resonance in the neutral species (Sachs e~~., 1971). Resonance 1, however, is shifted more than 1.5 p.p.m, to lower field relative to resonances 2 and 3 indicating a pronounced difference in the magnetic environment of this proton. Examination of the crystal structure model shows that there may be three factors contributing to the anomalous chemical shift of the imidazole Cr resonance of Hi~ll8. (1) The Cr proton of HIM18 is situated close to and in the planes of the imidazole and benzenoid rings of Hisl06 and Trp207, respectively. The anisotropy of the ring currents associated with these two residues is such that a deshielding effect will be experienced by the Cr proton. The resulting shift to low field is dimcult to quantitate accurately in this case but we estimate an effect of at least 0.6 p.p.m, based on the calculations made by Johnson & Bovey (1958). (2) Hisll8 is probably hydrogen-bonded to Glull6 at the Nca~position. The extent to which this interaction with the carboxylate group is likely to effect the chemical shifts of the imidazole Cr proton is not known, but it could be significant, especially in the light of the n.m.r, studies on chymotrypsin A by Robillard & Shn]man (1972) who indicate that hydrogen-bonding between His57 and Aspl02 alters the charge distribution of the imldazole ring. Unfortunately the Cos~ proton resonance in this system has not been observed. (3) Hi~ll8 is co-ordinated to the metal ion v~ its i~r atom whereas His93 and Ri~95 are co-ordinated via their Nr atoms. In the absence of'studies on suitable model systems the nature and extent of any differential shift effects on the Ccs~ proton resonance arising from the different models of co-ordination is not known. I t is interesting to note that resonance 1 in the B enzyme occurs appro~mately 0-5 p.p.m, to high field of the equivalent resonance in the C enzyme. This suggests that the local enviro~nent of Hisll8 (119) is different in the two species. Small shift differences may also be noted for the other two ligand resonances. Our titration data indicate that there are seven titrateable histidines in the native enzyme (Fig. 2). They are most likely to be the histidines situated at positions 2, 3, 9, 14, 16, 35 and 63 in the amino acid sequence since the crystal structure shows that these residues are exposed to the solvent (and apparently free to rotate). Hisl06 and His122 are not expected to titrate, and the corresponding residues were not observed in the n.m.r, spectra of the B enzyme (Campbell e~ a~., 1974).

Paxtial assignment of the titrateable resonances to pa~iculax histidine residues may be made by examination of the data in Table 1. Addition of the inhibitory anions iodide and cyanide to the native enzyme produces an appreciable effect on the behaviour of resonance l0 as clearly illustrated in Figure 5(a). Minor perturbations are observed in some other cases, but these are considered to be within the limits of experimental error. The histidine likely to be most susceptible to the effects of anion binding is His63, which is situated in the active-site crevice only 6/~ away from the metal and in closest pro~imlty to the anion binding site. However, it should be stressed that the proposed site for iodide binding in this enzyme (Vaaxa, 1974) is appro~mately 9/~ from the Cc2) proton of His63, which makes direct displacement of the histidine side chain by the anion seem lmlil~ely; a secondary effect produced by the perturbation of the surrounding structure would appear more probable. Further support for the assignment of His63 is found in the data obtained for the Co~+-substituted enzyme, where all of the titrateable resonances are observed with the exception of resonance 10 which is broadened or shifted beyond detection. Consideration of the relative distance of the various imidazole Cc2~ protons from the metal indicates the assignment of resonance 10 to His63. In the low activity isoenzyme, none of the Cc2) proton resonances of the three titrateable active-site histidines were observed in the presence of cobalt (Campbell et a~., 1974). Of the remaining titrateable histidines, the only one we are able to assign with some confidence is His35. Since this residue is placed further from the metal than any of the others it is least likely to be perturbed by the paramagnetic properties of the Co(II) ion in the substituted enzyme. Our results show that resonance 7 alone is insensitive to the presence of the cobalt ion and this makes it a good candidate for His35. This assignment is also supported by the data obtained from our experiments with the paxamagnetic hexacyanochromate anion. Here, the binding position of the ion is not known. However, the data (Fig. 7) suggest the presence of a strong binding site at a position close to His63 which is located in the active site crevice. This would correspond with our observations on the B enzyme where the hexacyanochromate ion selectively perturbed two of the active-site histidines (Campbell eta/., 1974). We would also surmise that the ion does not bind close to the metal, as is the case with most inhibiting anions, since the C~2) resonance of His93, one of the metal ligands, is only perturbed at higher concentrations of the ion. I t is likely that resonances 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9, all of which are broadened in this experhnent, correspond to the N-terminal group of histidine residues, which are situated near the "mouth" of the active site crevice. This is supported by the fact that a sharp resonance in the aliphatic region of the spectrum (2.05 p.p.m.), which we attribute to the methyl group of the aminoterminal N-acetylserine residue, is broadened appreciably by the paramagnetic ion. At present we cannot exclude the possibility that these histidine residues, most of which have a net positive charge at pH 5-8, are acting as secondary sites for "the binding of hexacyanochromate. Nevertheless, the most obvious assignment of resonance 7, which is completely unperturbed at all concentrations of the ion, is to HIS35 which is well removed from the binding region of the structure. This agrees with our previous conclusions. The above assignments are summarized in Table i. We have now assigned the Cc2~ proton resonances of the ligand histidines and the titrateable active-site histidines in both the high (C) and the low (B) activity forms of human carbonic anhydrase. We axe in a position, therefore, to compare the behaviour in the two enzyme species

of those histidines which are most likely to perform a role in the mechanism of action of carbonic anhydrase. Various groups have postulated that the activity-l~n~ed pKa of the enzyme may be attributable to an ionizsble am~no acid side chain in the active site, and some have proposed an im~dazole group (Pecker & Storm, 1968; Pecker & Stone, 1968). The only titrating histidine in the active site that is conserved in both the human B and C enzymes is His63 (64). In the C enzyme we have shown that this residue ionized with a pKa value of 7"1 which is very close to the value obtained for the activity-]inl~ed ionization in this species. In the B enzyme, however, all of the three titrating histidines in the active site have p g a values which are more than 1.5 pH* units below the pK a of the activity-linked group (Campbell e~ a/., 1974). I f we make the reasonable assumption that the same group is responsible for the important ionization in both the low and high activity forms, it would seem un]iI~ely that His63 (64) is the residue participating directly in the reaction, l~urthermore, while His63 in the C enzyme is fairly sensitive to the addition of inhibitors, its pK~ is shifted by merely 0.2 unit in the presence of CN- or high concentrations of I - in contrast to the pK a of the activity-l~n~red group. Nevertheless, while these facts suggest that the titrating activeness histidines do not play a major role in the carbonic anhydrase mechanism, it is possible that His63 in the C enzyme does have a function to perform in relation to the activity of this species as we shall discuss later. Other imidazole groups which may be considered possible candidates for the important ionizing residue are those liganded to the metal ion. In fact, the proposal has recently been advanced (Appleton & Sarker, 1974; cf., however, 1VIartin, 1974) that the enzymic pK~ may be associated with the pyrrole N-H ionization of neutral imidazole in the ligand system, rather than with the ionization of metal bound water, for example. Pugmire & Grant (1968) have shown that the imidazole 0c2~ proton is subject to a shift to high field of appro~mately 0-2 p.p.m, upon removal of a proton from the free base. One might therefore expect the ionization proposed by Appleton & Sarkar to be evident in the n.m.r, data, i.e. in the behaviour of the three ligand resonances as a function ofpH* (Fig. 5). In the B enzyme, only resonance 2 shows behaviour which could be considered to reflect an ionization but in this case the resonance moves doumfie/~/with increasing 0 H - concentration. In the C enzyme, in the absence of iodide, no resonance moves more than 0.1 p.p.m, at the activityl~n~ed pK, although resonance 2 is difficult to observe at low pH*. ~'urthermore, the crystal structure s~udies suggest that the pyrrole N-H of all the ligands are hydrogenbonded to protein groups (Kannan et al., 1975). These observations do not provide support for pyrrole ionization of a ligand histidine. However, our results are consistent with an activity-llnlred Zn2+-0H2 ionization. Addition of iodine at low pH* produces quite large displacements of the ligand resonances in the B and C enzymes, l~or example, in the C enzyme, resonances 1 and 2 move upfleld and downfleld, respectively, by more than 0.2 p.p.m, at high iodide concentration. On increasing the pH* the effect of iodide is removed because the binding becomes weak (Lindskog e~ al., 1971). These observations are consistent with a competition between OH- and I - for s metal-bound site. Thus, the binding of I st low pH* would cause a change in co-ordination geometry and hence movement of the ligand resonances in accordance with previous observations of the visible spectrum of the cobalt enzyme (Lindskog e~ aJ., 1971). The linewidth measurements show that the rate of D § transfer from an imidazole

group in the active site is a b o u t 3 · 104 s - 1 a t 25~ for an enzyme concentration of 3 raM. Moreover, a v e r y similar rate of transfer is measured from an imidazole far removed from the active site (i.e. His35). I t is interestiug to note t h a t this rate is faster b y about a factor of ten t h a n the rates measured in unbuffered solutions of the B enzyme using the same experimental conditions. The reason for the enhanced rate in the high activity form is not immediately obvious, since m o s t of the gross structural features of the protein are shared b y b o t h isoenzymes. However, one interesting feature which is peculiar to the C enzyme, and which m a y be relevant to this observation, is the remarkable density of histidine residues at the amlnoterminal end of the molecule (see Fig. 8), all of which are exposed to the solvent and titrateable. I t is conceivable t h a t these histidines have a role to play in facilitating rapid proton transfer to the solvent. Eigen & H a m m e s (1963) have pointed out t h a t the imidazole group is especially suitable for this purpose. I t is also possible t h a t His63, with a p K a value close to t h a t of the activity-linl~ed ionization, is poised to assist in proton transfer from the active site. Two of us (I. D. C.) and (A.
