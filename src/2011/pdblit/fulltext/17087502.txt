ABSTRACT: Acetobacter aceti converts ethanol to acetic acid, and strains highly resistant to both are used to make vinegar. A. aceti survives acetic acid exposure by tolerating cytoplasmic acidification, which implies an unusual adaptation of cytoplasmic components to acidic conditions. A. aceti citrate synthase (AaCS), a hexameric type II citrate synthase, is required for acetic acid resistance and, therefore, would be expected to function at low pH. Recombinant AaCS has intrinsic acid stability that may be a consequence of strong selective pressure to function at low pH, and unexpectedly high thermal stability for a protein that has evolved to function at 30 °C. The crystal structure of AaCS, complexed with oxaloacetate (OAA) and the inhibitor carboxymethyldethia-coenzyme A (CMX), was determined to 1.85 Å resolution using protein purified by a tandem affinity purification procedure. This is the first crystal structure of a "closed" type II CS, and its active site residues interact with OAA and CMX in the same manner observed in the corresponding type I chicken CS,OAA,CMX complex. While AaCS is not regulated by NADH, it retains many of the residues used by Escherichia coli CS (EcCS) for NADH binding. The surface of AaCS is abundantly decorated with basic side chains and has many fewer uncompensated acidic charges than EcCS; this constellation of charged residues is stable in varied pH environments and may be advantageous in the A. aceti cytoplasm.

Citrate synthase (CS)1 catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) and acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) into citrate,

coenzyme A, and a proton (Scheme 1). The first half-reaction is an aldol-Claisen condensation requiring the simultaneous protonation of a ketone and deprotonation of an acetyl group. In the rate-limiting second half-reaction, citryl-CoA (CitCoA) is hydrolyzed (1). CS is found in two distinct structural types: type I, often represented by pig CS (PCS), and type II, represented by Escherichia coli CS (EcCS). Type I CSs are found in most organisms, are dimeric, and have shorter sequences than type II CSs. Type II CSs are found in Gramnegative bacteria, are hexameric, and have an N-terminal -sheet domain, and some are allosterically inhibited by NADH (2, 3). All characterized CS forms have similar active sites, consistent with conservation of mechanism in a very ancient enzyme. Progressive CS conformational changes occur as CS binds OAA, which creates the binding pocket for AcCoA, and then in ternary complexes of CS with OAA and AcCoA analogues (4-6). Crystal structures of CS bound to citrate and coenzyme A (CoA) show additional conformations (4, 7, 8). The two domains in each CS subunit change relative orientations, but there is no single, easily identifiable "hinge" region. At present, only "open" conformations of type II EcCS have been visualized by X-ray crystallography, including structures with NADH but not substrates bound (2, 9, 10). CS is essential for acetic acid resistance in the vinegarproducing bacterium Acetobacter aceti (11). Like other acetic acid bacteria (AAB), A. aceti are Gram-negative, obligately aerobic, acidophilic rods that have been used for millenia to produce vinegar from ethanol (12). AAB kill competing

organisms by secreting acetic acid, a membrane-permeable organic acid that acidifies the cytoplasms of susceptible microorganisms, poisoning them and disrupting their proton gradients. During this process, the A. aceti cytoplasm also becomes acidic, yet the cells continue growing and oxidizing ethanol even as the cytoplasmic pH drops as low as 3.7 ( 0.2 (13). In this respect, A. aceti differs from other acidophiles, most of which tolerate only membrane-impermeant mineral acids (e.g., HCl) and avoid cytoplasmic acidification (14). AAB in the genus Acetobacter oxidize ethanol, acetic acid, and lactic acid to CO2, distinguishing them from AAB of the Gluconobacter and Gluconacetobacter genera, which lack a complete set of citric acid cycle enzymes (15) and are used for different industrial purposes (16). For example, the complete Gluconobacter suboxydans genome lacks recognizable genes for three citric acid cycle enzymes (17). The use of a complete citric acid cycle to oxidize excess acetic acid might help explain the greater acid tolerance of Acetobacter species relative to other AAB genera (18). A. aceti cultures grown at high acetic acid and ethanol levels require vigorous aeration (19, 20), which is also consistent with cytoplasmic acetate disposal using the citric acid cycle. Expressing either of the first two citric acid cycle enzymes (CS or aconitase) improves the acetic acid resistance of AAB (11, 21). Citrate synthase from industrial A. aceti strain 1023 (AaCS) is a type II CS that lacks several amino acid residues implicated in NADH binding (9). In facultative anaerobes, NADH allosterically inhibits CS, downregulating the citric acid cycle during anaerobic growth. Because A. aceti is a strict aerobe, it may not be surprising that AaCS lacks a NADH binding site. Since AaCS is required for acetic acid resistance in A. aceti, selection against inhibition by NADH [which binds EcCS more tightly at low pH (22)] may have been a more important factor. With an acidic cytoplasm that exerts strong selective pressure against acid-mediated inactivation, A. aceti should be a rich source of acid-adapted proteins. Many familiar acidstable proteins from other organisms are found in the periplasm (e.g., rusticyanin) or are secreted enzymes (e.g., pepsin); however, secreted proteins are not subject to the same selective pressures as cytoplasmic enzymes, which are regulated and substrate-specific and function in a metabolic context (23). In contrast, all cytoplasmic enzymes in A. aceti function at low pH. Comparisons of the biophysical features of multiple cytoplasmic proteins from A. aceti should reveal if acid resistance is achieved through common, recognizable strategies. The A. aceti proteome may also represent a library of enzymes that are useful for acidic bioprocesses. Here we describe the purification, biochemical characterization, and determination of the structure of AaCS. As predicted, AaCS resists acid-mediated inactivation and is not affected by NADH. Surprisingly, AaCS is also thermostable,

which suggests that acid- and temperature-stabilizing features in this protein might be related. The crystal structure presented here, of AaCS in complex with OAA and an AcCoA analogue, is the first of a "closed" type II CS. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials, general analytical procedures, and procedures for determining extinction coefficients, assessing OAA decomposition, and determining OAA binding constants are provided as Supporting Information. Synthesis of AcCoA Analogues. Dethiaacetyl-coenzyme A (dethiaAcCoA) and carboxymethyldethia-coenzyme A (CMX, Chart 1) were synthesized by using the procedure of Drueckhammer and co-workers (24) updated to use pantothenate kinase (PanK) to phosphorylate S-propyl thiopantothenate (25). Modifications to these procedures, and analytical data for the products, are given as Supporting Information. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions. Routine cloning procedures were performed with E. coli DH5R. E. coli W620 (thi-1 pyrD36 gltA6 galK30 rpsL129), obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, was used to test for complementation of the gltA mutation (26, 27) and was grown on M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.02 mM thiamine, 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin (amp), and when appropriate 3 mM L-glutamate. A. aceti strain 1023 was grown in YPD supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) ethanol at 30 °C. DNA Manipulations. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from A. aceti 1023 was isolated using a Genomic-tip 20/G device (Qiagen). gDNA (10 µg) was digested for 2.5 h at 37 °C with BamHI (18 units) and then reisolated using a QIAquick spin column (Qiagen). In a final volume of 50 µL, BamHI-digested gDNA (0.3 µg) was ligated to an adaptor (30 pmol) created by annealing oligonucleotides (ODNs) 532 and 554 (Supporting Information, Table S1), which form a partial duplex at their 3 ends. The A. aceti 1023 AarA gene was amplified by PCR using ODNs 413 and 416, and 3 ng of adaptor-ligated A. aceti strain 1023 gDNA as a template. The PCR product was digested and ligated into pET23a (Novagen) cut with NdeI and EcoRI to create plasmid pJK136. DNA sequencing revealed three single-base differences from the published sequence (GenBank accession number M34830), leading to two changes in the deduced amino acid sequence: codon 85 is GCC (Ala), not GAC (Asp), and codon 106 is GCG (Ala), not GTG (Val). There is also a silent difference in codon 50 (Phe). Two independently amplified PCR products containing AarA were found to have the same two differences in their DNA sequences. Our AaCS sequence has been deposited in GenBank as accession number DQ631551.

A. aceti Citrate Synthase Is Acid-Resistant QuikChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis of pJK136 with ODNs 865 and 866 gave plasmid pJK225, which encodes AarA with the LEHHHHHH octapeptide added to the C-terminus (AaCSH6). The NdeI-EcoRI fragment from pJK136 was ligated into pTWIN1 to give plasmid pJK226. Mutagenesis of pJK226 with ODNs 867 and 868 gave plasmid pJK227, which changes the AaCS TAA stop codon to TGC (Cys) and places the coding region for the C-terminal Mxe GyrA intein in frame. Mutagenesis with ODNs 884 and 885 gave plasmid pJK240, which adds a hexahistidine (H6) tag to the C-terminus of the plasmid-encoded chitin binding domain (CBD), to produce the AaCS-intein-CBD-H6 fusion protein. OVerexpression and Purification of AaCS Forms. AaCSdye was produced in E. coli B834(DE3) or BL21(DE3) transformed with plasmid pJK136 and purified using a dye ligand affinity column as described in the Supporting Information (Table S2). AaCSH6 was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pJK225 and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described in the Supporting Information. AaCSintein was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) or C41(DE3) transformed with pJK240. Protein expression was carried out in a 1 L culture of LB/amp in a 2.8 L Fernbach flask induced with 0.2 mM IPTG for 16-18 h at 15 °C. Cells from a 1 L growth were resuspended in buffer H [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 mM KCl] at 5 mL/g of cells and then sonicated and treated with streptomycin as described for AaCSdye. The supernatant was applied to an iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose (IDA)-Ni2+ column (2.5 cm × 3.5 cm), which was then washed with 3 column volumes (CV) of buffer H containing 20 mM imidazole. The IDA-Ni2+ column was developed with a linear gradient from 20 to 500 mM imidazole (50 × 50 mL, 7 CV) in buffer H.2 Fractions containing protein were concentrated, buffer exchanged to reduce the imidazole concentration to 5-10 mM, and loaded onto a chitin column (2.5 cm × 6 cm).3 The chitin column was then washed with 3 CV of buffer H and flushed with 3 CV of buffer HD (buffer H with 50 mM DTT). After 3 days, the liberated AaCSintein was eluted using buffer HD. Fractions containing AaCSintein were pooled and concentrated. At this stage, the protein was generally frozen in single-use aliquots and stored at -80 °C. AaCS intein used for crystallization was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (2.5 cm × 60 cm, Amersham) in buffer H. Purified enzyme was then concentrated, exchanged into 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mM NaCl, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. AaCS Oligomerization States. Analytical gel filtration was carried out at 5 °C on a Tosoh TSK-GEL G2000SWXL column (0.78 cm × 30 cm) in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 150 mM NaCl. The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine -globulin (159 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa), and acetone (0.06 kDa). AaCSdye or AaCSH6 (20 µg in 20 µL; initial subunit concentration of 21 µM) was loaded onto the column and eluted at 0.4 mL/ min in the equilibration buffer. Molecular sizes of unknown
2 The IDA-Ni2+ column can also be eluted in a single step with buffer H and 250 mM imidazole. 3 Fractions in 250 mM imidazole can be loaded directly onto the chitin column.

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 45, 2006 13489 protein species were determined using the log MW versus KSEC calibration method (28). Enzyme Assays. Enzyme activities were determined by two continuous assay methods: (A) using 5,5-dithiobis(2nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in a coupled assay that detects formation of CoA thiol at 412 nm (29, 30) or (B) monitoring cleavage of the thioester in AcCoA at 233 nm (31). All assays were initiated by the addition of CS to an otherwise complete 0.5 mL reaction mixture equilibrated at 25 °C for 3 min. One unit of activity is defined as 1 µmol of product formed per minute at 25 °C. Potential inhibitors and alternative substrates were tested as described in the Supporting Information. Assay A reaction mixtures contained (final concentrations) 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 0.4 mM OAA, 0.3 mM DTNB, 0.15 mM AcCoA, and 0.040.1 µg of CS. The optimal KCl concentration was determined over the range of 0-0.5 M. Kinetic constants were determined by varying the OAA concentration from 1 to 500 µM or the AcCoA concentration from 1 to 750 µM, holding all other concentrations fixed as in the standard activity assay. Assay B reaction mixtures contained (final concentrations) 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 0.4 mM OAA, 0.15 mM AcCoA, and 0.07-0.2 µg of CS. A 0.5 cm path length quartz cuvette was used. Kinetic constants were determined by varying the OAA concentration from 1 to 750 µM or the AcCoA concentration from 5 to 750 µM, holding all other concentrations fixed as in the standard activity assay. Substrate saturation curves were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. pH-rate profiles were constructed using assay B from pH 3.5 to 8.5 and assay A from pH 7.0 to 10.5 with 50 mM buffer and 100 mM KCl. Buffers were potassium phosphate (pH 3.5-8.0), CHES (pH 8.5-9.5), and CAPS (pH 10.010.5). Kaliedagraph (Abelbeck Software) was used for nonlinear least-squares fits of y (either kcat or kcat/Km, obtained from fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation) to eq 1, yielding c, the pH-independent form of the parameter y, and Ka values.

Acid Stability Assays. Inactivation of CS was used as a reporter for protein unfolding. AaCSdye or AaCSH6 was incubated at 0.7-1.4 µM (subunit concentrations, 0.03-0.07 mg/mL) at 30 °C in 50 mM potassium phosphate and 100 mM KCl at pH 3.5-7.0. Aliquots (0.12-2.4 µg) were withdrawn over time and added to an otherwise complete activity assay mixture equilibrated for 3 min at 25 °C. Meaningful zero-time points are not obtained in these experiments. All inactivation rates were determined by fits of single-exponential decays to the activity remaining versus time plot. Similar experiments were performed using incubations in different buffers (acetate, citrate, MES, or MOPS) at higher protein concentrations (5 µM subunits, 0.24 mg/ mL), or with PCS instead of AaCS. Crystal Structure Determination and Analysis. All crystallization experiments were carried out at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Ternary complexes were prepared by combining AaCSintein (6.5 µM subunit concentration), OAA (5 mM), and either dethiaAcCoA or CMX (15 µM) prior to buffer exchange and

13490 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 45, 2006 concentration as described above. Crystals were screened for diffraction using a Rigaku R-Axis IV image plate detector and a graphite-monochromated Cu KR X-ray beam from a Rigaku RU200 generator operated at 5 keV. Crystals of the AaCS,OAA,CMX complex were grown in 2.1 M ammonium sulfate, 150 mM sodium potassium tartrate, and 35 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.4). Prior to data collection, crystals were briefly dunked in crystallization solution with 25% (v/v) glycerol and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. A data set was collected from a single crystal at Advanced Light Source beamline 4.2.2. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using d*TREK (32) and then converted to structure factor amplitudes using the Truncate (33) program in CCP4 (34). The crystal was indexed with a primitive orthorhombic lattice, and examination of systematic absences allowed the P212121 space group to be assigned. Placing six 47 kDa monomers in the asymmetric unit would result in a solvent content of 57%, suggesting that the asymmetric unit likely contained a complete hexamer. A search model for molecular replacement was generated starting with the Pyrococcus furiosus citrate synthase (PfCS) dimer (PDB entry 1aj8) (7). This structure was aligned with two subunits of the hexameric EcCS structure (PDB entry 1k3p) (2), and regions that varied most between the two structures were removed. The search model then contained (PfCS numbering) residues 15-106, 124-167, 174-218, and 311-350 in each monomer. Side chains were then pruned to minimal conserved shapes using SEAMAN (35). For example, if the AaCS sequence had a Val in a position occupied by an Ile in 1aj8, the position would be mutated to a Val in the corresponding conformation. The structure of AaCS was determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (36), specifying that three copies of the dimeric starting model should be located in the asymmetric unit. The top solution had good crystal packing and a hexameric arrangement resembling that of EcCS. Rigid body refinement was then carried out in CNS (37), using data to 3 Å and allowing all protein segments to move independently. The resulting model had an R-factor of 51.0% (Rfree ) 51.2%); a 2 Å 2Fo - Fc electron density map calculated with phases from this model revealed clear density for side chains that were not modeled, as well as for large protein segments that were not modeled. Several rounds of manual building of chain A in O (38) and simulated annealing in CNS with data to 2 Å using noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) to generate the hexamer were then carried out, resulting in an R-factor of 31.1% (Rfree ) 33.6%). In subsequent rounds, each subunit of the hexamer was refined and manually adjusted without NCS restraints. OAA and CMX were then modeled into clear, unambiguous electron density in each active site. Additional rounds of water addition, manual rebuilding, and positional and B-factor refinement using CNS and REFMAC (39) were carried out. Several solvent peaks in the electron density map with tetrahedral or nearly tetrahedral geometry were modeled as sulfate ions. Calculations of root-mean-square differences (rmsd) between protein models were carried out in LSQMAN (40); calculations of buried surface areas were conducted in Chimera (41). Figures were rendered using PyMOL (42), Molscript (43), and Raster3D (44). Electrostatic calculations were performed using PDB2PQR (45) and APBS (46). RESULTS

Recombinant AaCS Expression and Characterization. The A. aceti strain 1023 aarA gene encoding AaCS was cloned into several T7 expression vectors. The inferred protein sequence differed from previous reports at two amino acids: amino acid 85 being Ala, not Asp, and amino acid 106 being Ala, not Val. Plasmid pJK136, encoding AaCS, restored prototrophy to gltA strain W620. Recombinant AaCS (AaCSdye) with a specific activity of 112 ( 11 units/mg was purified with a dye-ligand affinity purification step with Blue Sepharose resin (Supporting Information, Table S2 and Figure S1A), a technique selective for (acyl) CoA binding proteins (47). Repeated attempts to adsorb AaCS onto ion-exchange columns in low-ionic strength buffer solutions at pH 6.5-9.0 failed or gave inconsistent results. Slightly basic conditions allowed removal of most E. coli proteins with a short DE-52 column; this step improved the performance of the subsequent Blue Sepharose chromatography. Pure AaCSdye can be stored at pH 8.0 for up to 1 week at 4 °C without a significant loss of activity. Adding a C-terminal affinity tag to the AarA gene yielded AaCSH6, a protein that is easier to purify and has the same specific activity (111 ( 12 units/mg). A third construct was generated to produce AaCS fused to an intein tag, a chitin binding domain (CBD), and a hexahistidine tag. After metal and chitin affinity chromatography steps, native AaCS (AaCSintein) was released by thiol-mediated self-cleavage of the intein tag, along with the CBD and hexahistidine tag. The resulting enzyme has a specific activity (123 units/mg) similar to those produced with the other two constructs (Supporting Information, Table S3 and Figure S1). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) showed that each pure protein lacked a Met residue, presumably Met1: for AaCSdye and AaCSintein, an ion at m/z 47 994 was observed (expected 47 994.4), and for AaCSH6, an ion at m/z 49 057 was observed (expected 49 059.5). Each mass spectrum also exhibited an intense ion signal at m/z [M Met - 60]. This uncommon but precedented fragmentation is consistent with loss of either a guanidinium ion or a neutral guanidine from an arginine residue during the MS experiment (48, 49). The relative intensity of the [M - Met - 60] peak increases with the capillary potential but is unaffected by the accelerating potential. Molecular sizes were determined by analytical size exclusion chromatography in the absence of both KCl and NADH, each of which promotes hexamer formation in the NADHsensitive EcCS (50, 51). Unliganded AaCSH6 had an apparent molecular mass of 305 kDa, corresponding to a hexamer of 49 kDa subunits. Minor peaks consistent with larger aggregates and with dimers (70 kDa)4 were also observed (the dimer peak area was e7% of the hexamer peak area). This is in contrast with EcCS, which at comparable subunit concentrations and in the absence of NADH favors the dimer over the hexamer (50). Enzyme Characterization. Kinetic constants for the three AaCS constructs are similar (Table 1), and except where
4 While a 70 kDa peak has an apparent molecular mass that is smaller than what is expected for a dimer, it is unlikely to be a monomer given the extensive interactions between monomers observed in all known CS structures.

noted, all further enzymatic characterization refers to AaCSdye . Km values for OAA and AcCoA are closer to the Km values for Gluconacetobacter europaeus CS (20 and 51 µM) (52) than to those of EcCS (26 and 120 µM) (10) or PCS (5.9 and 5.1 µM) (53). These CSs had comparable kcat values (14 000, 4900, and 10 000 min-1, respectively) in slight variants of assay A. Potential inhibitors and alternative substrates were examined, as described in the Supporting Information (Table S4 and Figure S2). Sequence alignments indicate that AaCS is a type II CS but lacks an intact allosteric site for NADH (9). EcCS is strongly inhibited by NADH (54), which binds tightly (Kd  2 µM) even when key active site residues are mutated (55). KCl weakens NADH-mediated EcCS inhibition and has other stimulatory effects (54, 56). KCl was not required for AaCS activity, but increasing its concentration from 0 to 0.1 M increased the specific activity by 10-20%. Inhibition of AaCS by NADH was examined at up to 0.5 mM NADH with the KCl concentration varied from 0 to 0.4 M. The strongest apparent NADH inhibition was observed at 0.1 M KCl. The strength of NADH inhibition under these conditions was then examined using steady-state kinetics (Supporting Information, Figure S3). NADH is a weak AaCS inhibitor, with a noncompetitive inhibition pattern versus AcCoA at saturating OAA concentrations (Kii ) 69 mM; Kis ) 95 mM). AaCS contains four Trp residues, which fluoresce with an emission max of 339 nm (excitation at 295 nm). The fluorescence was quenched 25-30% by the addition of OAA to AaCSdye or AaCSH6 (Supporting Information, Figure S4). AaCS and AaCSH6 had the same emission max, and each exhibited a small red shift (3 nm) on OAA binding (emission max ) 342 nm). Similar changes in fluorescence emission were observed for Thermoplasma acidophilum CS (57), in which Trp348, analogous to AaCS Trp400, is the primary emitter (58). Its fluorescence is quenched by OAA binding nearby. Fluorescence changes were used to measure the Kd for OAA at pH 4.7 or 8.0 (Table 1; Supporting Information, Figure S5), under conditions that minimize photodecomposition (<4% of the observed F). Accounting for photodecomposition had no effect on Kds. Spontaneous OAA

Each point represents a parameter from a fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation of a velocity vs AcCoA concentration plot, performed using assay A [kcat (b) and kcat/Km (9)] or assay B [kcat (O) and kcat/Km (4)]. CitCoA kcat (0) and kcat/Km (×) are also shown. OAA was omitted from the assays with CitCoA. Error bars represent the uncertainty (kcat) or the root-mean-square (rms) uncertainty (kcat/Km) of the parameter(s) fit. Only the AcCoA data between pH 4.0 and 9.8 were obtained under conditions clearly saturating in OAA, but all data points were included in the fit.

decomposition (t1/2 ) 13 h at 25 °C and pH 3.5-9.0) was not significant (<2%) in the time required to determine Kd values (Supporting Information, Figures S6 and S7). pH-Rate Profiles. A pH-rate profile was assembled to learn if AaCS is broadly active over a range of pH or if it is optimized for activity at low pH. Extinction coefficients at 233 nm needed in the pH range of 3.5-8.5 were determined for OAA (0.73 ( 0.06 mM-1 cm-1), AcCoA (7.6 ( 0.6 mM-1 cm-1), citrate (0.01 mM-1 cm-1), and CoA (1.8 ( 0.1 mM-1 cm-1 at pH e8.5). At pH e8.5 under our experimental conditions,  233 ) 6.5 ( 0.8 mM-1 cm-1, somewhat higher than the published value of 5.4 mM-1 cm-1 (59). For a two-substrate enzyme with an ordered substrate binding mechanism, initial rates for a pH-rate profile are determined at saturating levels of the first substrate (60). The preferred order of substrate binding by CS is OAA and then AcCoA, with accompanying protein conformational changes (57, 61, 62). OAA Km values were determined from pH 3.5 to 10.5 (Supporting Information, Figure S8). In the experiments used for AcCoA, pH-rate determinations, OAA was unambiguously saturating (g8Km) in the pH range of 3.89.8. Kinetic constants from AcCoA saturation curves, measured using both activity assays, were used to construct bell-shaped pH-rate profiles for AaCSdye (Figure 1; more profiles are given in the Supporting Information, Figures S9-S11). The pKa values obtained for all AaCS forms were similar to each other and those for PCS (6.5 and 10.1) (31). The kcat and kcat/Km plots have the same value for pKa1, indicating this inhibitory protonation occurs on AaCS complexed to OAA. Possible candidates for pKa1 include Asp371 (EcCS Asp362 and PCS Asp375), which helps bind and enolize AcCoA (63, 64), and the OAA carboxylates, which are not involved in

FIGURE 2: Semilogarithmic plot showing acid stability assays at 30 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn from the low-pH enzyme incubation solution and used to initiate an otherwise standard activity assay A. Inactivations of AaCSdye were carried out at pH 3.5 and 0.033 mg/mL (O), pH 3.5 and 0.24 mg/mL (4), and pH 4.0 and 0.033 mg/mL (0). Inactivations of AaCSH6 were carried out at pH 3.5 and 0.071 mg/mL (b), pH 3.5 and 0.24 mg/ mL (×), and pH 4.0 and 0.071 mg/mL (9). Fits shown are singleexponential fits to data obtained at t > 0 [(s) AaCSdye and (- - -) AaCSH6]. The higher-concentration incubations at pH 3.5 show at least two phases.

catalysis. The pKa2 values are slightly higher in the kcat pHrate plots, representing ionizations in the Michaelis complex (AaCS,OAA,AcCoA). Candidates include one of the active site histidines [His272 (PCS His274), involved in AcCoA enolization, or His313 (PCS His320), involved in polarizing the OAA ketone] with pKas shifted above their normal value (6.5) by OAA-mediated stabilization of the protonated form. One or more arginines (314, 364, and 414) that bind AcCoA phosphates might also be responsible. Caution in the interpretation of pKa values is warranted: CS adopts multiple conformations, including during the catalytic cycle (65), and mutagenesis studies indicate that key active site residues participate in both reactions performed by CS (66). Acid Resistance. Kinetic assays measuring the loss of AaCS activity upon incubation at low pH were performed at the typical growth temperature of A. aceti over the entire known cytoplasmic pH range (Figure 2). Between pH 3.5 and 6.0, the inactivation rate for AaCSH6 was suitable for accurate rate determinations; a narrower range was useful for AaCSdye, which was too stable at pH >4.0. (The six additional His residues present in AaCSH6 are positively charged at pH 3.5, a potentially destabilizing factor not present in AaCSdye.) At low enzyme concentrations, reasonable fits to single-exponential decays were obtained (Table 2). The inactivation rates for both AaCSdye and AaCSH6 increased sharply at pH <4, but both were substantially more stable than PCS (at pH 3.5, t1/2 ) 54, 58, and 1 min, respectively). At pH 3.5, the apparent initial activity was lower than expected, suggesting that a partial inactivation occurred in the dead time of this experiment, 1 min. Incubations performed at higher AaCSdye or AaCSH6 concentrations yielded slower inactivation at pH 3.5, by a nonsingle-exponential process.

CD spectra for AaCS at various pH values were consistent with a largely helical protein (Supporting Information, Figure S12A). CD was used to monitor the irreversible thermal denaturation of AaCS (Supporting Information, Figure S12B) and determine apparent Tm values (Table 2). Thermal unfolding of AaCS generally caused visible protein precipitation; however, the enzyme did not precipitate at pH 3.5, even after overnight incubation at 5 °C. When heated, AaCS partially unfolded at pH 3.5, yielding an altered CD spectrum (Supporting Information, Figure S12A) consistent with a more -rich structure (67). CD denaturation profiles indicate that at pH g4.0 AaCS is substantially (20 °C) more thermostable than PCS, which unfolds irreversibly with a Tm of 48 °C at pH 7.5 (68-70). The thermal denaturation profile of EcCS is biphasic with an onset at 50 °C (71) and, therefore, is difficult to compare with the monophasic AaCS profiles. Crystal Structure of AaCS. Crystallization of AaCS was initially attempted using AaCSdye and AaCSH6, the second of which gave more promising crystals. AaCSH6 crystallized under a variety of different PEG conditions, forming small rod-shaped crystals or clusters of very thin crystals. Cocrystallization of AaCSH6 with enzyme substrates, substrate analogues (dethiaAcCoA or CMX), or products did not improve crystal quality (J.-W. Nam and W. Wikoff, unpublished observations). The AaCSintein protein, however, crystallized readily as a complex with OAA and CMX. The structure of AaCS complexed with OAA and CMX was determined by molecular replacement using the dimeric PfCS from the hyperthermophile P. furiosus as a search model. The initial molecular replacement solution consisted of a trimer of dimers within the asymmetric unit, representing the enzymatically active hexamer. The initial 2Fo - Fc electron density maps allowed unambiguous tracing of most of the polypeptide chain. Several rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding resulted in a model containing a nearly complete polypeptide chain for each of the six monomers; maps calculated with phases from this model revealed clear electron density for OAA and CMX, which were then built into each active site. Electron density for one active site is shown in Figure S13 of the Supporting Information. Surface loops including residues 1-10 (all chains) and 155-163 (chains A, D, and F) are disordered and are not modeled. The current crystallographic model has been refined to an R-factor of 19.5% (Rfree ) 23.1%). Refinement data and statistics are given in Table 3. Coordinates and structure

factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) as entry 2h12. The overall shape of the AaCS hexamer is that of a lefthanded turbine or thick propeller, approximately 125 Å in diameter and 80 Å tall. The AaCS hexamer has the same trimer-of-dimers arrangement as EcCS. The three dimeric units are tilted 30° from the molecular 3-fold axis, and the clefts between the dimers are occupied by seven to nine sulfate ions. Each dimer interface is extensive, burying 5900 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface per monomer, while interdimer contacts are localized along the central waterfilled cavity and bury 900 Å2 per monomer. Like that of EcCS, the AaCS central cavity is lined with basic residues, including (EcCS numbering in parentheses) Arg126 (Arg119), Arg133 (Arg125), and Arg134 (Arg126). The crystal structures of AaCS and EcCS (PDB entry 1owb) hexamers have 51 and 50% polar surface area, respectively. This fraction is the same in the dimers of chicken CS (GgCS, 50% in PDB entry 1csi) and PCS (52% in PDB entry 4cts). This contrasts with another acid-stable enzyme, A. aceti PurE, which has much less polar surface area than other PurE forms (72). The most striking difference between the EcCS and AaCS surfaces is the large proportion of basic residues on the AaCS surface (Figure 3). Comparisons of several structural features between AaCS and EcCS are given in Table 4. The monomer structure of CS is very similar in all the type I and type II CSs with known structures, including the AaCS structure described here (Figure 4). AaCS consists of 16 R-helices, analogous to those in other archaeal and bacterial enzymes. Like EcCS, AaCS also has an N-terminal region that folds into a -sheet with residues from the adjacent monomer and a C-terminal loop that extends along the surface of the adjacent monomer. The individual monomers of AaCS are nearly identical to one another, with rmsd between chains of 0.24-0.28 Å over 417 CR atoms. The most variable regions among monomers are surface loops near residues 340 and 412, as well as helical regions comprising residues 278-307 and 332-336. Each AaCS monomer contains one active site, which consists of an OAA binding site in the interior of the protein

at the end of an 20 Å CoA binding tunnel. Several crystal structures are available for type I CS bound to CoA derivatives or analogues; these are all bound in similar conformations. CMX, the analogue bound here, is present in a conformation most like that observed for CoA in PfCS (Figure 5). Residues from a single monomer form hydrogen bonds with CMX, with the exception being Arg414 (PfCS Arg353) from the adjacent monomer. Other residues whose side chains form hydrogen bonds with CMX include (PfCS numbering in parentheses) His272 (His223), Lys307 (Lys256), Arg314 (Arg263), Arg364 (Lys305), Asn369 (Asn310), and Asp371 (Asp312); residues with main chain atoms forming hydrogen bonds with CMX include Ala271 (Ile222), Leu308 (Ile257), Gly310 (Gly259), and Phe311 (Ala260). A water molecule forming a hydrogen bond to N3 of the CoA adenine moiety in PfCS is replaced in AaCS with the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr360. This residue is located on a loop of the protein which is longer and differently oriented in AaCS. OAA and the carboxylate end of CMX are bound in an arrangement nearly identical to that observed in the GgCS, OAA,CMX complex (73). This arrangement is consistent with the proposed mechanism (64, 74) in which Asp375 abstracts a proton from the methyl group of acetyl-CoA, His274 stabilizes the negative charge on the resulting enolate anion, and His320 polarizes the OAA ketone, priming it for nucleophilic attack. The corresponding residues in AaCS are Asp371, His272, and His313, respectively. Other residues forming hydrogen bonds with OAA in AaCS are (GgCS numbering in parentheses) His237 (His238), Asn240 (Asn242), Arg322 (Arg329), Arg396 (Arg401), and Arg417 (Arg421), where the prime indicates a residue from the adjacent monomer. Type I CS crystal structures have been determined in both a closed form, in which AcCoA analogues, OAA, or products are bound, and an open, unliganded form. The only crystal structures available for type II CS enzymes are those for EcCS in the open form. The open form of EcCS differs from

the open form of type I enzymes. In particular, two helices comprising EcCS residues 261-302 (GgCS residues 271317) are translated outward from the interior of the protein. This rotation can be visualized as resulting from a rotation about the Gly262 CR-C bond. Given these conformational differences between type I and type II enzymes in the open form, one might predict that the closed forms would differ as well. However, AaCS complexed with OAA and CMX is in the closed form with a structure very similar to the closed form of the type I CS enzymes (rmsd of 1.47 Å over 331 residues).

Although the relative orientation of the three dimers is the same in the open EcCS structures and the closed AaCS structure, several localized differences exist (Supporting Information, Figure S14). Relative to the EcCS structure, AaCS has helix N moved inward (toward the CMX binding site), helix O moved up (toward the N-termini) and slightly outward, and helix Q with its following turn moved upward. The C-termini are in different locations. To determine whether the open form of AaCS resembles that of EcCS, we attempted to crystallize AaCS in the absence of substrates or inhibitors. No crystals of unliganded

enzyme formed under the conditions used for the complex. Like AaCSH6, unliganded AaCSintein formed small, poorly diffracting crystals from a variety of PEG precipitants. AaCSintein crystals grown under conditions similar to those reported for EcCS [2 M ammonium sulfate, 4-5% (v/v) PEG400, and 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)] had better morphology but were very sensitive to handling and yielded only an incomplete data set with usable signal to 6 Å; this crystal displayed partial hemihedral twinning with a twinning fraction of 0.3. Structure determination using this poorquality data set was not pursued. Two structures of type II EcCS bound to NADH are available (PDB entries 1nxg and 1owb). Although AaCS is insensitive to allosteric inhibition by NADH, the structure of the vestigial NADH binding pocket is remarkably similar to that observed in the EcCS,NADH complexes. Several NADH-contacting residues that are conserved among NADHsensitive CSs (9) are found in similar orientations in AaCS (EcCS numbering in parentheses): Thr119 (Thr111), His122 (His114), Arg171 (Arg163), Lys175 (Lys167), Gly189 (Gly181), Pro195 (Pro187), Asn197 (Asn189), and Glu215 (Glu207). In the AaCS crystal structure, a sulfate ion is bound in a position occupied by the NADH -phosphate (nicotinamide side) in the EcCS,NADH complexes. This sulfate ion forms hydrogen bonds with His118 (His110), Tyr153 (Tyr145), Arg171, and Lys175. Several structural differences are apparent in this region (Figure 6). EcCS Met112, implicated as being key for NADH binding (9), is replaced with Leu120 in AaCS; however, this is a conservative mutation, and the side chain conformations are similar. Thr204 is replaced in AaCS with Arg212, the side chain of which could presumably block NADH binding. A possible compensatory change is found on the opposite side of the binding pocket, where EcCS Arg109 is replaced with Asn. The guanidinium groups of AaCS Arg212 and

13496 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 45, 2006 EcCS Arg109 occupy the same region over the NADH adenine ring. Perhaps more important, the side chain of AaCS His118 (EcCS His110), which forms a bridge between the two halves of the horseshoe-shaped NADH, is shifted in AaCS with respect to its position in both NADH-bound and unliganded EcCS. Also, EcCS His146 is replaced with AaCS Pro154, and residues following this Pro constitute a disordered loop in the AaCS crystal structure. This substitution may prevent the loop joining helices G and I from properly folding to form a binding pocket for the nicotinamide end of NADH. Soaking AaCS crystals in 1 mM NADH did not result in additional electron density in the region corresponding to the EcCS NADH binding site. DISCUSSION The cytoplasmic pH of A. aceti decreases with external pH over a wide range, due to the influx of acetic acid. In contrast, the cytoplasm of most terrestrial acidophiles, acidresistant bacteria, and alkaliphiles are protected from environmental stresses by impermeable membranes, cytoplasmic buffering agents, and other barrier strategies (14). Proteins from these organisms are therefore not necessarily more resistant to environmental stresses than are their "neutralophile" analogues. In contrast, A. aceti proteins are forced to adapt to continuous exposure to acetic acid at low pH. To better understand the mechanisms of acid resistance in A. aceti and to explore how its enzymes function in acidic environments, we have biochemically characterized AaCS, showing that it is resistant to acid-mediated inactivation and determining its structure in a catalytically competent state. There are at least three nonexclusive ways for AaCS to remain active at low pH: it might be optimized for catalytic function at low pH, it might have improved stability at low pH, or it might be protected by chaperone proteins. There is no evidence that AaCS has been optimized to have higher activity at low pH; AaCS is active over a broad pH range with well-separated pKa values, like other CS forms (31). The Km and Kd values for OAA are similar and relatively constant (within a factor of 2) from neutral to low pH (Table 1; Supporting Information, Figure S8), indicating that formation of the AaCS,OAA complex would not be particularly inhibited by low pH. Mechanistic investigations of AaCS have thus far not revealed any major alterations in proton transfers (H. Jiang and T. J. Kappock, unpublished observations). In addition, the sequence and structure of AaCS show conservation of all key active site residues (Supporting Information, Figure S15). When bound to OAA and CMX, AaCS adopts the same closed structure observed for type I CS enzymes. Both OAA and the AcCoA analogue bind in the same conformations as in the other CS structures. This lack of optimization for activity at low pH is not surprising, as the cytoplasmic pH range tolerated by A. aceti is both unusually acidic and unusually broad (13). Retaining some activity over a broad pH range is likely to be more important than optimizing specific activity for a particular pH. In contrast, several lines of evidence indicate that AaCS is resistant to acid-mediated inactivation during prolonged incubations at low pH. Thermal unfolding assessed by CD showed substantial stabilization of AaCS at low pH relative to a PCS control, indicating that the folded state of AaCS is stable over a broad pH range. AaCS was quite resistant to

Francois et al. inactivation at moderately acidic pH, with half-lives of hours to days in an assay that monitored residual activity as a reporter for folded protein. Inactivation rates sharply increase only as the pH approaches 3.5, the lower limit of the known cytoplasmic pH for A. aceti (13), showing that AaCS is durable under all physiologically relevant conditions. Since these studies were performed with pure AaCS, chaperones are not needed to explain the observed stability. There is also no evidence that citrate, the product of AaCS and a potent Hofmeister (75) "salting-out" (stabilizing) anion (76), has any role in regulating AaCS activity or stabilizing A. aceti proteins. The observed 5 fold acceleration of AaCS inactivation in citrate versus phosphate buffer at pH 3.5 suggests citrate exerts a different anion-specific effect on AaCS (77). Both acetate and citrate, each of which might accumulate in the A. aceti cytoplasm, were only moderate reversible inhibitors of AaCS, although citrate was a more potent inhibitor at pH 4 (Supporting Information, Figure S2 and Table S4). A similar resistance to acid without catalytic retooling for low-pH optima is observed for A. aceti alanine racemase (78) and PurE (79). Many different factors contribute to the stability of a protein; some of these factors may provide stability under a variety of conditions, while others allow the protein to remain stable under a specific condition such as high temperature or low pH. Structural features that stabilize a folded protein structure in general include a well-packed hydrophobic core, a lack of electrostatic repulsion, and hydrogen bonding to compensate for removal of polar or charged groups from aqueous solution. Some specific features thought to contribute to thermostability include short sequence length (80) and deletion of exposed loops (81), formation of ion pairs (82), a preference for Arg and Tyr residues and avoidance of Cys and Thr residues (83), a preference for charged residues and for -branched hydrophobic residues (80), and a patchwork of oppositely charged surface residues (84). While some of these specific features may contribute to acid stability as well, others may be ineffective or even deleterious at low pH. For example, formation of ion pairs within a protein may be advantageous only at elevated temperatures, where the energy penalty for desolvation of the side chains is smaller (85). Similarly, surface acidic residues no longer repel each other low pH, possibly promoting protein aggregation. Specific characteristics thought to improve acid stability include reduced surface charge density to prevent electrostatic repulsion at pHs above and below the pKas of acidic surface residues (86), an infrequent overall occurrence of charged residues and particularly basic residues (86-88), a frequent occurrence of the polar neutral residues Ser and Thr (86), and oligomer formation to reduce exposed surface area (89). Surprisingly, when compared to EcCS, AaCS lacks many of the anticipated characteristics of an acid-stable protein (Table 4). While AaCS has a moderately reduced proportion of charged residues (20.6% vs 23.4% in EcCS), the differences in surface charge are most striking. Rather than avoiding positive charge on the surface, AaCS has a surface abundantly decorated with basic side chains (Figure 3). Compared with EcCS, AaCS also has many fewer uncompensated acidic residues on its surface (Table 4). This arrangement is likely more stable in the variable pH of the A. aceti cytoplasm (the pH falls from near-neutral to acidic

A. aceti Citrate Synthase Is Acid-Resistant as saturating cell density is reached): a basic protein surface will undergo less charge fluctuation as the cytoplasmic pH varies. In contrast, an acidic protein would have an altered charge decoration and may experience a charge inversion, each of which could destabilize a folded protein. A positively charged surface may also prevent penetration of the surface by hydronium ions at low pH. Despite adaptations that render AaCS acid-resistant, all key citrate synthase active site residues are conserved. AaCS contains all of the active site arginines at positions 314, 322, 364, 396, 414 (Lys404 in EcCS), and 417; this is not surprising because all are highly conserved residues, but it is striking because a buried cluster of basic residues would be expected to electrostatically destabilize acid-resistant proteins. When bound to OAA and CMX, AaCS adopts the same closed structure observed for type I CS enzymes. Both OAA and the AcCoA analogue bind in the same conformations as in the other CS structures. Some type II CS forms have added regulatory features, notably a strong NADH-mediated inhibition first observed with EcCS (3). NADH inhibition allows facultative anaerobes to downregulate the citric acid cycle when growing anaerobically. AaCS is only affected by NADH at nonphysiological concentrations in the mid-millimolar range. This observation is consistent with an analysis of NADH binding residues (9) and with subtle structural differences between the EcCS NADH binding site and the vestigial site in AaCS described above. Given the importance of AaCS in acetic acid resistance, regulation by NADH might be deleterious. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank S. Spiess and P. Khayyat for technical assistance. We thank D. M.
