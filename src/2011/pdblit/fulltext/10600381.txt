A model for the tertiary structure of plant 5S rRNA, previously proposed by our laboratory (Joachimiak, A. et al. (1990) Int. J. Biol. Macromol., in press) was tested by specific cleavage of the plant 5S rRNA in the presence of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. The bexanucleotides used in this study were complementary to different portions of loops C, D and E, the nucleotides of which have recently been proposed to be involved in tertiary hydrogen bonds. The results obtained strongly support the interaction of loops C and D by nucelotides C34, C35, C36, A37 and (;85, G86, (;87, U88, respectively. Digestion pattern of loop E (domain gamma, nucleotides 66-110) suggests a possible different arrangement of this part of the plant 5S rRNA molecule, when compared with other eukaryotes.

Introduction
Ribosomal 5S RNA is an integral constituent of ribosomes of all organisms with exception of some mitochondria [2]. Currently, a substantial amount of data on the primary and secondary structure of this RNA is available [3,4]. However, only limited information exists concerning the three-dimensional structure [5]. Attempts to determine its tertiary structure using physico-chemical methods have, so far, not been as successful as for tRNA [6,7], because the 5S rRNA is too large for N M R spectroscopy and because of only limited success in obtaining crystals suitable for X-ray analysis [8,18,19,20]. Therefore, the main source of information concerning its tertiary structure of 5S rRNA is derived from biochemical experiments with nucleases and chemicals which specifically modify nucleic bases [5,10,11]. One of these methods, involving ribonuclease H (RNase H), is ideally suited to investigate the structure of small RNA molecules [12], as previously demonstrated for U1 snRNA, m R N A and ribosomal RNA including 5S rRNA [13].

RNase H is a ubiquitous enzyme required for DNA replication and it is thought to be involved in digestion of short RNA primers required for the initiation of DNA synthesis. It degrades the RNA strand of DNARNA hybrids only, hydrolyzing the RNA endonucleotically with formation of 3'-hydroxyl and 5' phosphate groups at the cleavage sites. Other types of nucleic acid duplex are not digested. In order to increase our knowledge of the three-dimensional arrangement of the beta (nucleotides 14-66) and gamma (nucleotides 66-110) domains in plant 5S rRNAs (Fig. 1) [1], we have used RNase H to digest this RNA in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to these sequences. We conclude from the resulting digestion patterns for the 5S rRNAs from wheat and lupin, that the previously proposed tertiary interactions involving nucleotides 34-37 and 85-88, do indeed occur in 5S rRNA. The existence of another interaction proposed between A100 and U53 is not clearly substantiated by the experimental results. Additionally, our results suggest that the gamma domain of plant 5S rrRNAs, may also have a structure (Fig. 5) different from that proposed earlier (Fig. 1) [1].

69 by Sephadex G-75 filtration and BD-cellulose column chromatography [14]. The purity of the RNA was checked by fractionation of the preparation in a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel [15]. Radioactive labelling at either the 5' or 3' end was carried out using [~,-32p]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase or [32p]pCp and T4 ligase, respectively [15]. The oligodeoxynucleotides with sequences complementary to different portions of putative singie-stranded regions were synihesized by the phosphoramidite method [16] using an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Model 380A). The oligonucleotides were purified by the HPLC method. Conditions of hybridization of the oligodeoxynucleotides to wheat germ and lupin 5S rRNAs were identical to those used previously [13,16].
Results

Major elements in the tertiary structure model of plant 5S rRNA are interactions between nucleotides of loops designed C and D (or E) and probably between residues loops B and E [1,4] shown in Fig. 1. To test for their existence we have employed RNase H digestion in the presence of the oligodeoxynucleotides which were

complementary to the sequences of 5S rRNA of interest. To carry out these experiments we used conditions comparable to those which had previously been optimized for use in eubacterial 5S rRNA structural analysis [13,16]. To check for the potential tertiary interactions of wheat germ and lupin seeds 5S rRNAs, we used the five oligodeoxynucleotides the sequences of which are shown in Fig. 4. The results of RNase H digestion in the presence of the four oligonucleotides (numbered 1-4) are shown in Fig. 2. Identical digestion patterns were obtained for both 5S rRNA species. As can be seen from the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3, cleavage RNase H was observed only when oligonucleotides Nos. 2, 4 and 5 were used in the hydrolysis studies. Interestingly, in the case of oligonucleotide No. 2, (GTTCTG), which is complementary to the 5S rRNA nucleotides sequence (nucleotides 39-42), only one cut is clearly seen. To check the proper assignment of the cleavage site RNase H digestions, we also used 3'-labelled 5S rRNA and obtained identical results (Fig. 3). In contrast to oligonucleotide No. 2, oligonucleotide, No. 1 did not promote any hydrolysis by RNase H in the complementary RNA sequence. In this study we also devoted our attention to the structure of the gamma domain of 5S rRNA (e.g., loops D and E). Oligonucleotide No. 3 had no influence at all on its susceptibility to cleavage by RNase H, but oligonucleotide Nos. 4 and 5 were able to induce cleavage RNA by this enzyme. Furthermore, it can be seen that RNase H produces two cuts in the presence of oligonucleotide No. 4 and three cuts in the presence of oligonucleotide No. 5. It is noteworthy, that with oligonucleotide No. 4, nucleotide 92 is the most readily attacked.
Discussion

Fig. 1. The secondary structure of lupin 5S rRNA and proposed model of tertiary structure of the plant 5S rRNAs [1].

Wheat germ and lupin seed 5S rRNAs differ from each other in their nucleotide sequences in seven positions [14]. As the differences are not in loops C, D or E, we could use the same oligodeoxynucleotides for studying the tertiary structure of the RNA from both species. The method which we used is based on the ability of RNase H to cut only the RNA of DNA-RNA hybrids. In this reaction RNA is hydrolyzed within or immediately adjacent to the regions complementary to the DNA oligomer [12]. Four tertiary base pairs are suggested to be of major importance in our model for the three-dimensional structure of plant 5S rRNAs. To provide further evidence for this, we decided to use oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to sequences involved in these interactions. In addition, three other oligodeoxynucleotides were used to study the configuration of other parts of 5S rRNA, whose structure is still ill defined.

For results of the digestion experiment with oligonucleotide No. 5 (see Fig. 3). The oligonucleotide binding regions, composition of the oligonucleotidesand interpretation of the results are as given in Fig. 4.

I n contrast, the other p o r t i o n s of loops C, D a n d E are hydrolyzed, suggesting that they are in singles t r a n d e d regions. The effectiveness of R N A cleavage is a f u n c t i o n of the strength of the D N A - R N A hybrid f o r m a t i o n , e.g., the availability of the R N A for complex

points of view. First, it indicates that this part of loop D is unpaired and, due to strong complex formation, this enables RNase H to express its hydrolytic activity. Second, the hexanucelotide No. 4 interacts with nucleotides G~7-U88-G89-A90-C91-C92 in loop D of the 5S rRNA. According to our model [1] and in agreement with data from oligonucleotides Nos. 1 and 3, nucleotides G87 and U88 are involved in the tertiary interactions with the bases in loop C. It is therefore reasonable that the four nucleotides 89-92, are available to form complexes. These as well as other data [11], suggest that as few as four base pairs may provide a suitable substrate for RNase H. Oligodeoxynucleotide No. 5 is longer than part of loop E (Fig. 4). It pairs with bases from G99 up to C104. That this interaction does take place is exemplified by the fact that the RNA is hydrolyzed at nucleotides 102, 103 and 104. On the assumption that the binding of the oligonucleotide did not disrupt existing secondary structures, we would like to propose that in plants the gamma domain, in which loop E could be significantly enlarged and have the configuration shown in Fig. 5. During our studies of plant 5S rRNA structues with alpha sarcin [17] we noticed that out of three bulges, C49-A50, U63 and C105, only the region of the molecule around the proposed bulge, C105, is not digested at all. This means that the structure differs in this point. Therefore, it would seem justifiable to suggest a rearranged structure in our model around C105 as indicated in Fig. 5. Occasionally, we observed that on addition of deoxyribonucleotides to RNA alone, but in the absence of RNase H, degradation of the 5S rRNAs occurred (Fig. 1A, lane 10 and Lorenz and Erdmann, unpublished

The observation of digestion at C-44 supports the notion that this part of loop C interacts with oligonucleotide No. 2 and, therefore, is not involved in tertiary bonds within 5S rRNA molecule (Fig. 4). With respect to this part of the molecule, we obtained similar results for Equisetum arvense 5S rRNA [16]. Oligonucleotide No. 4 catalyzed the most frequent cut at C-92 (Figs. 3 and 4). This result is interesting from two
