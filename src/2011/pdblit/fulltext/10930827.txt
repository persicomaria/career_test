The structures of deoxy human haemoglobin and an arti®cial mutant (Tyr423His) have been solved at 120 K. While overall agreement between these structures and others in the PDB is very good, certain side chains are found to be shifted, absent from the electron-density map or in different rotamers. Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) is very well obeyed in the native protein, but not around the site of the changed residue in the mutant. NCS is also not obeyed by the water molecule invariably found in the -chain haem pocket in room-temperature crystal structures of haemoglobin. At 120 K, this water molecule disappears from one  chain in the asymmetric unit but not the other.

1. Introduction
Haemoglobin is one of the best characterized proteins, both from a structural and functional view. Despite the enormous effort devoted to studies of the molecule, there still remain unanswered questions regarding the differences between the  and  subunits and the free-energy contribution of different interactions to the oxygen af®nity of the molecule and the equilibrium between allosteric states. The crystal structure of human haemoglobin was ®rst determined by Perutz and coworkers in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the absence of oxygen (or other haem ligands), the protein was found to adopt a structure containing several salt bridges between the 11 and 22 dimers and the Fe atoms were displaced from the plane of the haem in each subunit. On binding oxygen, the Fe atoms moved into the haem plane, causing the subunits to change tertiary structure slightly but suf®ciently to destabilize the deoxy quaternary structure. By 1970, the structures of both the deoxy and met forms of the protein were suf®ciently well re®ned for Perutz to put forward his famous `trigger hypothesis' in which the tense (`T') state, preferred by the deoxy protein, switches to the relaxed (`R') state on oxygenation by sensing the position of the Fe atoms. Several predictions of the Perutz hypothesis were testable using naturally occurring human Hb (haemoglobin) mutants such as Hb Kansas (Asn1023Thr), which has an unstable R state and a low oxygen af®nity (Fermi & Perutz, 1984). Although more than 500 different mutants have been detected clinically, the great majority of these have little functional effect since the survival of a patient is clearly dependent on the molecule working adequately well. Natural mutants afforded little opportunity for experiments on the roles of many residues close to the haem or at subunit interfaces. The development of Escherichia coli expression systems for the production of engineered Hb mutants was therefore an

important step in the functional characterization of these residues. A number of expression systems have now been described. The ®rst of these required expression of the individual subunits and subsequent refolding, which is highly labour intensive (Nagai et al., 1985). Later systems produced large yields of folded haemoglobin but with altered N-termini (Looker et al., 1992). By overexpressing methionine aminopeptidase at the same time as the - and -globin genes, Ho and coworkers have now succeeded in producing enormous yields of folded functional human Hb correctly processed at the N-termini from E. coli (Shen et al., 1993). Detailed structural and functional analysis of Hb mutants is of great interest in the ®eld of synthetic blood substitutes known as HBOCs (haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers; Bunn, 1993; Komiyama et al., 1996). At present, however, the best re®ned structure of native deoxy human Hb is that of Fermi et al. (1984). Although the data used were of high resolution Ê (1.74 A), protein structure re®nement methods were primitive compared with the graphical and computational programs now available. We have re-solved the structure of deoxy Hb using a cryo-cooled crystal and an image-plate X-ray detector, re®ning the structure using a maximum-likelihood method instead of real-space re®nement. We have also solved the crystal structure of an engineered Hb mutant, Tyr423His, treated in the same way. The differences between our structures and previous structures of Hb are discussed.

able crystals out. The crystal colour was examined under the microscope to check for signs of oxygenation or oxidation, but none were visible. After a brief (roughly 30 s) washing, a crystal was removed in a ®bre loop and placed on the goniometer head in a cold stream of nitrogen at 120 K.

Human Hb was prepared from blood freshly drawn from one of the authors (JT). Protein puri®cation and crystallization were carried out according to the procedure of Perutz (1968), except that crystallization was carried out in 100 ml tubes and dithionite instead of ferrous citrate was used to remove oxygen. Conversion of the protein to the deoxy form was immediately visible as a colour change from bright red to purple. The oxygen af®nity and reaction rate of the protein preclude the possibility of collecting X-ray data on deoxy Hb crystals under air at room temperature. All previous deoxy structures have therefore been mounted in capillaries, usually in a nitrogen glove-box. If suf®cient dithionite is present in the mother liquor, however, it is possible to seal a deoxy Hb crystal in a capillary while working in an aerobic environment (Wireko & Abrahams, 1992). Capillary mounting is incompatible with cryocooling, so we took the logical step of adding dithionite to an appropriate mother liquor containing 25% glycerol in which deoxy crystals are stable for a few minutes and which can be cooled rapidly to 120 K without ice formation. A few grains of fresh sodium dithionite were added to 1 ml of this mother liquor in a glass dimple plate just prior to opening the tube of crystals. Immediately after opening the tube under air it was ®lled with a small volume of this mother liquor to prevent free oxygen reaching the crystals. It was then inverted over the remainder of the mother liquor to allow a few size-

The mutant protein was produced using the -globin expression system described by Tame et al. (1991). -Globin was expressed alone in E. coli and then refolded with native human -globin to form tetrameric Hb. The mutagenesis was carried out by Professor Kiyohiro Imai of Osaka University. Once synthesized and puri®ed according to the published methods, the mutant protein was then handled in an identical fashion to the wild-type protein.
2.2. Data collection and refinement

X-ray data were collected using a Rigaku R-AXIS II imageplate system mounted on a copper rotating-anode generator. X-rays were focused by a mirror system (MSC), K radiation being removed by a nickel ®lter. 1 oscillation images were collected and the data were processed using DENZO (Otwinowski, 1990). All subsequent data handling was carried out using the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Re®nement was carried out using the structure of an arti®cial mutant Hb Val13Met (PDB code 1dxu; Kavanaugh, Rogers & Arnone, 1992) as a starting model. Although the space group is the same and the unit-cell parameters are very similar, the R factor calculated with the data from frozen crystals and this model was very high. The model was therefore repositioned by molecular replacement using AMoRe (Navaza & Saludjian, 1997) at the start of re®nement. 5% of re¯ections were randomly chosen to be excluded from re®nement for the calculation of a free R factor È (Brunger, 1992). After AMoRe, the initial R factor and free R factor were both 35%. Re®nement was carried out using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). Manual adjustment of the model was carried out using QUANTA (Molecular Biosym Ê Inc.). Low-resolution terms to 15 A were included in the re®nement and bulk scaling was used to help model the solvent. No ' cutoff was applied at any stage of data handling or re®nement. After the initial stages of re®nement, individual B factors were re®ned for each atom and the water molecules were ordered by B factor once the structures were completed. Data-collection and re®nement statistics are given in Table 1.

Fermi et al., 1984), the high-salt structure of Hb Val13Met (1dxu; Kavanaugh, Rogers, Case et al., 1992) and low-salt crystals grown from PEG, 1hbb (Kavanaugh, Rogers, Case et al., 1992) and 1hga (Liddington et al., 1992; Paoli et al., 1996), all of which were solved at or near room temperature. We refer to our native structure as `DX' and the mutant structure as `Y42H' throughout. R.m.s. deviations between these structures and the previous entries in the PDB are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that DX and Y42H generally agree with each other rather better than with the other structures, despite the effects of the mutation (which are described below), showing that they re¯ect the treatment and handling of the crystals and X-ray data. Agreement between the structures is high, as would be expected given the resolution of Ê the data sets (1.9 A at worst) and in line with expected coordinate errors. No electron density was observed for the N-terminal residue Val1 or the side chain of His2 in the maps calculated for DX and Y42H, so these residues were omitted from the models. Since these residues have high temperature (B) factors in the other structures and there is also little agreement between them in position, it seems probable that they are disordered. The inclusion of these residues in other structures may re¯ect model bias, which is largely eliminated by the maximum-likelihood method. 3.1.1. Haem pockets.

Not surprisingly, the high-salt structure of deoxy Hb at 120 K shows few signi®cant deviations from the crystal structures determined at room temperature and low-salt conditions. We have compared our structures with the previous re®nement of high-salt deoxy Hb (PDB code 2hhb;

between the haems is governed by the subunit interfaces. The connection between the geometry of these interfaces and the haems has been well documented (Perutz et al., 1987), but further twists continue to emerge from X-ray structures of intermediate states which are unstable in solution (Paoli et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1996). Figs. 1 and 2 show the 2Fo À Fc electron-density map over the 1 and 2 haems. The geometry of the residues around the haems is very similar in all the structures examined. The displacements of the Fe atom from the haem plane are given in Table 3. The most signi®cant feature of the haem pockets is the absence of any density for the water molecule in the 1 subunit in both the DX and Y42H structures. This water molecule, which hydrogen bonds to the distal histidine, is found in both -chain haem pockets of all the room-temperature deoxy-Hb structures discussed in this paper. A water molecule found in the same position of sperm whale myoglobin appears to act as a kinetic barrier to ligand binding (Carver et al., 1990). In contrast, there is insuf®cient space for a water molecule in the  subunits. Figs. 1 and 2 show clearly that there is no electron density for this water in the 1 haem pocket, but very strong density appears in 2. This difference is quite remarkable given that the protein atoms for the two  subunits can be overlapped very closely in this region. A similar situation is

found in the structure Y42H, but in this case the distal histidine side chain has been ¯ipped 180 around 12 since a partially occupied water molecule has appeared above it in the haem pocket. Rotating the imidazole group brings this water within hydrogen-bonding distance of N42. The only structural explanation for the disappearance of the water molecule from the haem pocket of the 1 subunit is a slight shift in the position of the haem relative to the distal residues. If the 22 dimer is superimposed on the 11 dimer by least-squares ®tting the C positions, then it can be seen that the rotated and Ê translated 2 haem lies approximately 0.1 A below the 1 haem. It appears then that the haem pocket is compressed slightly by the treatment of the crystal: either the addition of glycerol, cryocooling or a combination of the two. This compression appears suf®cient to expel the water molecule completely, despite only being on a scale comparable to the error in the coordinates of an atom in the structure. Among the structures examined, Y42H is unique in the position of the propionate groups of the 2 haem. Although these groups point into solvent and seem to play little role in oxygen binding, their position has been found to be indicative of the oxidation state of the haem iron in the case of lupin leghaemoglobin. Harutyunyan and coworkers found that changing the haem from deoxy to met (but not to oxy) in this structure caused the propionate group attached to pyrrole A of the haem to move from a proximal position to the distal side of the haem (Harutyunyan et al., 1995). However, the electron density of the Y42H Hb mutant shows no evidence of oxidation, no ligand density being visible at very low contour levels and the position of the Fe atom relative to the haem plane being consistent with a completely deoxy haem.
3.2. Tyra423His

In native deoxy human Hb, it was found by Perutz (1970) that Tyr42 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp299 which is broken as the two  dimers move relative to each other to reach the R state. This hydrogen bond gives rise to a resonance in the proton NMR spectrum of Hb which is taken as a signature of the T state (Fung & Ho, 1975). Although this resonance (at +9.4 p.p.m. relative to water) is not observed in

D2O, indicating that the proton is exchangeable, the rate of exchange of the tyrosine proton and water protons appears to be slow on the NMR timescale (Russu et al., 1987). This may be a consequence of the strength of the Tyr±Asp hydrogen bond, which is suggested by the relatively short distance Ê between the donor and acceptor atoms, $2.55 A, and the fact that both side chains participate in a wider hydrogen-bonding network which will tend to stabilize the interaction. The equivalent residue in the  subunits, 41, is generally Phe. In about 10% of vertebrate species a Tyr is found at this position and has been implicated in lowered oxygen af®nity (Tame et al., 1996) and altered heterotropic ligand binding (Komiyama et al., 1995). Mutating 42 would therefore be expected to weaken the T state and raise oxygen af®nity. Functional analysis of two mutants, Tyr423His and Tyr423Phe, showed that this is the case (Imai et al., 1991). Kim and coworkers have also demonstrated the importance of the 1±2 hydrogen bond by making two partly compensatory mutations at these positions (Tyr423Asp, Asp993Asn; Kim et al., 1994). We were unable to obtain deoxy crystals of Hb(Tyr423Phe), probably as a result of the strong destabilization of the T state. The Phe side chain is unable to hydrogen bond to Asp99 at all, but a weak hydrogen bond can form with His at 42. The oxygen af®nity of this mutant is not increased as much in the His mutant as the Phe mutant. Structural characterization of the Tyr423His mutant was carried out to determine whether or not the observed increase in oxygen af®nity was simply a consequence of the loss of a T-state hydrogen bond. In the case of the 12 contact this would appear to be the case, but there are marked differences around 242 between the two copies of the  subunit found in the asymmetric unit. This region developed poor geometry and electron density early in re®nement when NCS restraints were applied. On removing these it became clear that significant changes had occurred and the new positions of side chains were determined by omit maps. This region is compared in Figs. 3 and 4, which show clearly the structural rearrangement which has taken place in the 21 contact region. The side chains of Arg292 and Arg140 have swapped places, apparently as a result of electrostatic repulsion between His242 and Arg140. This Arg residue swings its side chain towards Glu143, which normally forms a salt bridge with Arg292. This residue takes up a position close to that usually occupied by 140, but with its guanidinium group Ê further from 242 and within 3.0 A of the carbonyl O atom of 140. This rearrangement leads to a peptide ¯ip of Arg292, moving it from the left-handed helical region of the Ramachandran plot to a position between the right-handed helical and -sheet regions, a quite unusual departure from noncrystallographic symmetry. The B factors for the displaced Ê Args are much higher, 20±45 A2, than those in the expected Ê 2. Arg240 is barely moved by the mutation, positions, 7±15 A though its side-chain B factors are approximately double those in the wild-type structure (DX). Arg140 shows more movement of its guanidinium group and its B factors are roughly tripled by the introduction of histidine at position 242. The structure of Y42H shows that the mutation raises oxygen

af®nity not only by weakening the 42±99 bond but also by weakening other 21 interactions. The disruption of NCS in the molecular tetramer indicates that the altered conformation is close in energy to the native conformation. This destabilization of the protein is accompanied by very minor changes in the structure of the 12 contact, however, showing that protein structure does not always re¯ect stability. A related effect was observed among a group of Hb mutants with N-terminal mutations, the one with the structure closest to that of HbA having the most strongly altered oxygen af®nity (Kavanaugh, Rogers & Arnone, 1992). In the case of the 42 mutant it seems that the destabilization of the T state not only arises because of the loss of a hydrogen bond, but also because of the greater ¯exibility around the altered residue. Tyr42 is of some interest not only because of its functional role but also because of the suggestion made on the basis of ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy that it accepts a hydrogen bond from Asp299 in the T state rather than donating one. This hypothesis was put forward on the basis of a slight up®eld shift of a band (Y8a) attributable to the tyrosines in the structure (Rodgers et al., 1992). Five of the six tyrosines found in the  dimer have almost identical environments in both the R and T structures of Hb, the only exception being Tyr42. p-Cresol was used as a model compound to test the shift of its UVRR band equivalent to the Y8a band of Hb. This shift was interpreted as indicative of hydrogen-bond donation from the aspartate to the tyrosine in the T state. It was claimed this is consistent with the crystallographic structure, which shows the Asp99 side chain to be `in a solvent-inaccessible hydrophobic environment'. In fact, all of the T-state structures discussed in this paper include a surface water molecule hydrogen bonded to the Asp99 carboxyl group. Even if the side chain were buried, it is unlikely that its pKa would be raised higher than that of the tyrosine hydroxyl group. Elevated Asp and Glu side-chain pKas are observed in many enzymes where these groups are directly involved in catalysis, but even the close approximation of two carboxyl groups only raises the pKa to about 7 (McIntosh et al., 1996). The protonation of Asp299 in T-state Hb, which is implied by its donation of a hydrogen bond, is made even less likely by the hydrogen bonds it forms with the main-chain N atom of Glu2101 and the side-chain N atom of Asn97. The side chain of Asp299 forms four strong hydrogen bonds in all (Table 4). Support for the Rodgers hypothesis has come from the group of Friedman, also using UVRR but in this case with a double mutant Hb, Tyr423Asp, Asp993Asn (Huang et al., 1997). This showed no change in the position of the Y8a band on ligation

of the Hb, indicating that the shift seen by Rodgers et al. was indeed because of Tyr42. The Y8a and Y9a bands were also assigned directly by Nagai et al. (1996) using the Y42 mutant. However, the ability of histidine to substitute for tyrosine and retain a functional cooperative Hb shows that there is no need to invoke such an unusual hydrogen bond to make the protein work (Imai et al., 1991). We therefore suggest that the proposal of this inverted hydrogen bond is wrong.
3.3. Water

The number of water molecules and their average B factors in the various structures are given in Table 5. It can be seen that the B factors are similar for the waters included in the different models, indicating that this re¯ects static disorder as much as thermal vibration. Quite stringent criteria have been applied in re®ning the model 1hga and only 89 waters are included, a relatively small number given the number of non-H protein atoms (4556). In order to examine the consistency of water positions among the various structures, the shortest distances from fully occupied waters in the different models to the equivalent water in DX (where one existed) were calculated. The structures were overlaid by least-squares minimization of the distances between the protein main-chain atoms before determining the inter-water distances. Water molecules were excluded if the nearest neighbour in the DX structure was found to be in a different asymmetric unit. An Ê arbitrary cutoff of 3.5 A was also applied to ensure that waters were in roughly equivalent positions, otherwise the comparison would be meaningless. The average distance of water molecules to their equivalents in the DX structure are shown in Table 6. The average displacement is lowest for Y42H, despite the movement of water molecules near the site of the mutation, so the positions of the waters do seem to re¯ect the handling of the crystals and the data, which was identical in these two cases. The average distances are broadly in line with the error expected from the least-squares overlap and the errors in the coordinate positions. The systematic differences between the water structure of deoxyhaemoglobin at room temperature and at 120 K clearly has implications for the inference of the biological role of water molecules in cryocooled crystal structures. Water molecules have a profound in¯uence on the behaviour of proteins and are found to be buried in many protein±ligand complexes, where they have been shown to play an important role in controlling ligand af®nity and speci®city. The visualization of water molecules associated with protein structures by NMR is only possible for the small minority of waters

which remain bound to the same protein molecule for relatively long periods. In contrast, X-ray crystallography readily reveals the pattern of hydration about biomacromolecules provided that the crystals diffract adequately. Cryocooling crystals has become a very popular method for extending the lifetime of protein crystals in an X-ray experiment and has the additional advantage of revealing many more water molecules in protein structures. The disappearance of the functionally important haem-pocket water molecule of the 1 subunit at very low temperature, but not from the symmetry-related 2 subunit, further illustrates the dif®culties in correlating water structure to function.
3.4. Rotamers

Rotamer preferences of different residues are quite marked and distinct (Ponder & Richards, 1987). We have identi®ed a number of residues which have unusual side-chain angles in 2hhb, 1hga, 1hbb and 1dxu, particularly leucine side chains. Ê Even with data at better than 2 A resolution it can be dif®cult to distinguish between a generally preferred rotamer of leucine and one in which 12 is rotated by 180 . These latter conformations are uncommon and are usually errors. 20 leucine residues were ¯ipped in this way towards the end of re®nement when the electron-density maps were clearest. One leucine residue (32) does appear to be in an unusual conformation. Our models differ from 2hhb at three leucine side chains in each  dimer. Although these changes may have little functional signi®cance, they illustrate the point that comparison between models, by which the allosteric transition is mapped, is made more dif®cult when studying models re®ned under different conditions by different programs. In the case of asparagine, glutamine and histidine residues, the last side-chain 1 angle may easily be 180 in error since the shape of the group is preserved and N atoms are swapped with O or C atoms. This appears to have occurred for His103, which has caused particular problems in NMR studies. This is a highly conserved residue at the 11 contact, its side chain ®tting into a shallow pocket formed by the  subunit. On the basis of the high-resolution deoxy structure (2hhb), a long Ê hydrogen bond ($3.5 A) was inferred between N42 of His103 and the carbonyl O atom of Asn108 (Fermi et al., 1984). This region of the molecule is of interest because a naturally occurring mutation (Asn1083Lys, found in Hb Presbyterian) has potential as a means of lowering the oxygen af®nity in commercial HBOCs. The His103 side chain is in the same position in 1hga, but is ¯ipped in all the others. This brings the Ê N42 atom within 2.8 A of O41 of Gln131. In the structures

2hhb and 1hga there appears to be a steric clash between this O atom and His103 C41, which suggests strongly that the histidine residue has been positioned incorrectly. This type of error is found fairly frequently in older PDB entries deposited before simple validation tools were available. Older entries are also found to contain a number of nomenclature errors which can cause problems when least-squares ®tting different structures. For example, there are 45 nomenclature errors in 2hhb; the r.m.s. deviation of all polypeptide atoms between Ê Ê DX and 2hhb is 0.77 A if these are ignored but 0.67 A if they are corrected prior to the calculation. The overall agreement between the two models described here shows that they are globally more closely related to each other than structures of Hb determined at room temperature, whether in the same space group or not, despite the local rearrangement caused by the mutation of Tyr42. It has been noted before that different re®nement programs leave their imprint on protein coordinate sets and it is generally possible to discover which one was used from characteristic features in the geometry of the model (Laskowski et al., 1993). This makes the comparison of structures from the PDB rather more dif®cult. The error margins in crystallographic models are not usually a barrier to structural insights into molecular mechanism, but they may be signi®cant in attempts to calculate the free energy of particular interactions, for example between a protein and its ligand. However, higher resolution structures are still unlikely to overcome the problems of freeenergy estimation, so it appears there is some way to go before haemoglobin is truly understood. This is clearly illustrated by animal haemoglobins such as the ®sh haemoglobins whose extreme pH sensitivity remains unexplained after several decades of study. We would like to thank Drs Kiyoshi Nagai and Julie Wilson, and Professors Kiyohiro Imai, Guy Dodson and Maurizio Brunori for commenting on the manuscript.
