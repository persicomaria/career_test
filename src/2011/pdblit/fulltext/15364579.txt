Abstract
C1r, C1s, MBL-associated serine protease (MASP)-1, MASP-2 and MASP-3 are mosaic serine proteases of the classical and lectin pathways of complement. They form a family of enzymes with identical domain organization and similar overall structure, but with different enzymatic properties. MASP-2 of the lectin pathway can autoactivate and cleave C4 and C2 components. In the classical pathway two enzymes mediate these functions: C1r autoactivates and activates C1s, while C1s cleaves C4 and C2. The substrate specificity and the biological function of MASP-1 and MASP-3 have not yet been completely resolved. MASP-1 can autoactivate and the activated MASP-1 has more relaxed substrate specificity than the other members of the family. It was demonstrated that MASP-1 can specifically cleave C2, C3 and fibrinogen, but the physiological relevance of these findings has to be proved. We do not know how MASP-3 becomes activated and its biological function is also not clear. In this review, we will summarize current knowledge about the structure and function of these proteases. Special emphasis will be laid on the specificity, autoactivation and evolution of these enzymes. r 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

against invading pathogens, but it plays an important role in developing and modulating the adaptive immune response, as well. The complement system comprises more than 35 proteins including soluble plasma proteins and cell-surface-bound components. Of major significance in the system are serine proteases (SPs) that activate each other in a cascade-like manner. According to our present knowledge there are three different pathways through which the complement system can be activated: the classical, lectin and alternative pathways. The classical and lectin pathways have several characteristics in common, which distinguish them from the alternative pathway. The activation of the classical and lectin pathways results in the formation of the

C4b2a enzyme complex, which is the C3-convertase. These activation pathways are initiated when a recognition molecule binds to the appropriate activation structure. Upon this binding SP zymogens, which are associated with the recognition molecules, become activated and cleave the next components of the cascade. The classical pathway has been studied for a long time and, although there are several open questions, there is a consensus between researchers regarding the major characteristics of the pathway (Arlaud et al., 1987, 2001; Schumaker et al., 1987). The research of the lectin pathway is a relatively new area of molecular immunology, since it was discovered some 20 years ago (Ikeda et al., 1987). However despite the similarity with the well-characterized classical pathway and despite intensive research there are many disputed issues regarding the structure, function and physiological relevance of the individual components and the entire pathway, as well. The recognition molecule of the classical pathway is C1q. C1q is composed of 18 polypeptide chains (6A, 6B and 6C) and has six globular heads and six collagen-like stalks. The globular heads bind to the antibody components of the immune complexes, whereas the collageneous stalks harbour the tetramer of C1r and C1s SPs. In the C1s≠C1r≠C1r≠C1s tetramer both proteases have their own distinct functions: C1r is capable of autoactivation and cleavage of zymogen C1s, while activated C1s can cleave C4 and C2, the next components of the cascade. In the case of the lectin pathway, we have many types of recognition molecules including mannose-binding lectin (MBL) (Holmskov et al., 2003) and ficolins (H, L and M-types) (Matsushita and Fujita, 2001). These molecules resemble C1q except that they are composed of one type of polypeptide chain and they bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the surface of microbes. Moreover MBL and ficolins exist in different oligomeric forms which have different affinity for pathogens, different associated protease composition and different complement fixation ability. The picture becomes even more complicated if we take into account the different MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). The most abundant protease components of the lectin pathway are MASP-1 (Matsushita and Fujita, 1992) (6 mg/ml in serum) and MASP2 (Thiel et al., 1997) (0.5 mg/ml) while MASP-3 (Dahl et al., 2001) is regarded as a minor component. There is a consensus among researchers that MASP-2 can autoactivate and specifically cleave C4 and C2, but the substrate specificity and physiological role of MASP-1 and MASP-3 are rather debated issues. There is another MBL-associated protein: MAp19 or sMAp (Stover et al., 1999; Takahashi et al., 1999) which is the N-terminal third of MASP-2 without any catalytic activity. Combining the different recognition molecules

with the different MASPs using different stoichiometry, we can get an extremely complex inventory of supramolecular complexes with potentially diverse biological functions. The complexity of the lectin pathway could be the reason for the different and often contradicting research reports published in the literature. In this review, we summarize some aspects of our current knowledge about the C1r, C1s and MASPs of the classical and lectin pathways. During recent years, much information has accumulated about the structure and functional properties of these enzymes. These novel findings are leading to a more detailed understanding of the activation and control of the complement system, as well as providing insight into the structural background of the action of modular SPs.

The structure of C1r, C1s and MASPs
C1r, C1s, MASP-1, MASP-2 and MASP-3 form a family of SPs with identical domain organization and similar overall structure. All these enzymes are multidomain SPs consisting of six domains (Fig. 1). The C-terminal SP domain is preceded by five non-catalytic modules. The N-terminal CUB domain is followed by an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module, a second CUB domain and a tandem repeat of complement control protein (CCP) modules. The chymotrypsin-like SP domain (S1 peptidase family) has its N-terminal activation peptide, which is often called the ``linker region'' followed by the SP domain. These enzymes are synthesized as one-chain proenzymes and become activated when an Arg≠Ile bond is cleaved between the activation peptide and the SP domain. The resulting two chains (A chain and B chain) are held together by a disulphide bridge. The A chains have a rather similar length (approximately 420≠440 amino acids), while the B chain of MASP-3 (280 amino acids) is somewhat longer than the SP domains of the other four proteases (242 amino acids for C1r and MASP-2, and 251 amino acids for C1s and MASP-1). The MASP-2 protein has no post-translational modification while the A chains of the other four proteases are N-glycosylated (two glycosylation sites for C1r and C1s, and four glycosylation sites for MASP-1/3). In the case of C1r and MASP-3 the SP domain is also glycosylated (two and four glycosylation sites, respectively). It should be noted that the MASP-1 and MASP-3 proteins are the products of alternative splicing from a single MASP-1/3 gene (Dahl et al., 2001). They share the same N-terminal CUB1≠EGF≠CUB2≠CCP1≠CCP2 region, while the SP domains are encoded by different exons. The 171-amino acid-long MAp19 protein is the alternatively spliced product of the MASP-2 gene. It comprises the CUB1 and EGF modules of MASP-2 plus an extra C-terminal EQSL tetrapeptide, which is encoded by a separate

exon. Since the SP domain of MASP-1 and MASP-3 are evolutionary and functionally quite different, the existence of the two mosaic proteases is a remarkable example of exon shuffling where exons with different origin recombine to form new proteins during evolution (Patthy, 2003). In the case of C1r and C1s, limited proteolysis with trypsin or plasmin yielded two major products: the N-terminal a-fragment which comprises the CUB1 and EGF modules and a short part (approximately one-third) forms the CUB2 module and the gB fragment which contains the CCP1, CCP2 and SP domains. It was demonstrated using these fragments that the N-terminal domains are responsible for the interaction between C1r and C1s, and for the interaction between the C1s≠C1r≠C1r≠C1s tetramer and the C1q. The gB region proved to be the catalytic fragment of the molecules: in fluid phase it cleaved the substrates as efficiently as the entire protease. Recombinant expression of truncated N- and C-terminal fragments of MASP-1 and MASP-2 and site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the same principle: the CUB1≠EGF≠CUB2 region is responsible for dimerization (the MASPs make homodimers) and for the binding to MBL or ficolins (Wallis and Dodd, 2000; Thielens et al., 2001; Cseh et al., 2002), whereas the CCP1≠CCP2≠SP fragments mediate the catalytic activity (Ambrus et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2001). The crystal structure of the N-terminal region of C1s (Gregory et al., 2003), that of rat MASP-2 (Feinberg et al., 2003) and the structure of MAp19 (Gregory et al., 2004) have been published. These structures show dimers in which the monomers associate in a head-to-

tail configuration. There are intensive contacts between the CUB1 module of one monomer and the EGF-like module of the other. The Ca2+ ion which is bound to the EGF-like module contributes to the stabilization of both the intra- and intermonomer CUB1≠EGF interactions. A second Ca2+-binding site was also found at the distal end of the CUB1 module of C1s and MAp19, which can have stabilizing function as well. These findings explain the Ca2+-dependent homodimerization of C1s and MASP-2. It is very probable that the same structural principles hold for the homodimerization of the MASP-1 and MASP-3 proteases and perhaps for the C1ra≠C1sa heterodimerization. It is very puzzling however why no heterodimers between MASP-2 and MAp19 or between MASP-1 and MASP-3 have been detected, even though they share the very same N-terminal domains. The X-ray structure of the C-terminal catalytic region of active C1s (Gaboriaud et al., 2000) and that of the active and zymogen C1r (Budayova-Spano et al., ¥ 2002a, b), and MASP-2 (Harmat et al., 2004; Gal et al., 2005) has also been determined. The SP domains show the typical chymotrypsin fold with two sixstranded b-barrels with the catalytic triad (Ser195, His57 and Asp102) located at the junction of the two barrels. (Throughout the text we use the chymotrypsin numbering for the SP domains.) Eight surface loops determine the S1 and other subsite specificities. The access to the substrate-binding subsites is often restricted which can explain the narrow specificity of these proteases. Surprisingly, the conformation of the corresponding surface loops of C1s and MASP-2 are

different, although these enzymes share almost the same substrate specificity. A common feature of these structures is that the ellipsoidal CCP2 module is oriented perpendicularly to the surface of the SP domain. This spatial arrangement is in accordance with the observation, that the CCP modules can provide additional substrate-binding sites for the protein substrates (see below). In the case of C1s the crystal structure shows a rigid CCP2≠SP interface, however the same module-domain junction in C1r and MASP-2 seems to be rather flexible. In the asymmetric unit of the MASP-2 CCP2≠SP crystal, we can see two distinct conformers with different CCP2≠SP orientations stabilized by different sets of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts (Harmat et al., 2004). These results indicate that the flexibility of the CCP2≠SP junction could be a general phenomenon in the C1r/C1s/MASPs family and can have important functional consequences. During activation and subsequent substrate cleavage, significant conformational changes should take place in these mosaic protease molecules. One of the sources of this flexibility could be the CCP2≠SP interface. The presence of the CCP2 module also stabilizes the structure of the catalytic region as it was demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry in the case of C1r (Kardos et al., 2001) and MASP-2 (Harmat et al., 2004). The melting point of the CCP2≠SP fragments were significantly higher (Dt º 6≠8 1C) than that of the single SP domain. The crystal structure of the CCP1≠ CCP2≠SP fragment of zymogen MASP-2 shows a rather ¥ rigid CCP1≠CCP2 junction (Gal et al., 2005). In the case of C1s, however, site-directed mutagenesis experiments in the CCP1≠CCP2 intermodule region proved that the flexibility of this linker region plays a critical role in the cleavage of the large C4 substrate, which should be positioned correctly for optimal cleavage by the SP domain (Bally et al., 2005). Further experiments should demonstrate whether the same principle is valid for the other members of the family, especially for MASP-2. Unfortunately we have little structural information about the CUB2 modules of these proteases and we do not know anything about the nature of the CUB2≠CCP1 junction, which also could be an important source of molecular flexibility.

Catalytic activity, substrate specificity
The C1r, C1s and MASPs show some general features of the trypsin-like SPs. They all have trypsin-like specificity as they cleave after basic amino acids (Arg, Lys). At the bottom of their substrate-binding pocket, there is a negatively charged Asp residue which makes contact with the basic P1 residue of the substrate. The substrate specificities of these proteases, however, are very restricted compared to other cognate proteases

(e.g., trypsin, kallikreins, granzymes, etc.). C1r, C1s and MASP-2 cleave basically two natural substrates. Another important feature of these enzymes is that they have low enzymatic activity. For example, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM value) of MASP-2 against the thioester substrate Z-Lys-SBzl is 2.0 ¬ 104 M¿1 s¿1 (Harmat et al., 2004) whereas trypsin cleaves the same substrate with an efficiency of 1.4 ¬ 107 M¿1 s¿1 (Hedstrom et al., 1996). The low activity combined with the restricted substrate specificity makes these enzymes very precise tools in initiating the complement cascade. C1r ¥ (Gal et al., 1989), MASP-1 and MASP-2 have the ability to autoactivate, which means that the zymogen enzymes become cleaved and activated without the contribution of any extrinsic protease. This autoactivating capacity is an inherent property of the zymogen. This is a very important phenomenon since autoactivation of these enzymes is the first enzymatic step in the complement cascade. It happens when the recognition molecule binds to the target, which means that a non-enzymatic signal is converted to an enzymatic one. In the C1 complex C1r can autoactivate and activated C1r cleaves and activates zymogen C1s. Activated C1s is the enzymatic component of the C1 complex, which is responsible for cleaving of C4 and C2. Thus C1r has two natural substrates: zymogen C1r and C1s. The catalytic efficiency of truncated C1r fragments was studied in order to determine the role of the CCP modules (Kardos et al., 2001; Lacroix et al., 2001). It turned out that the SP domain is capable of autoactivation and C1s cleavage, but the presence of the CCP2 module greatly enhances the catalytic efficiency of both reactions (one order of magnitude increase). As we mentioned above there is a general stabilizing effect of the CCP2 module on the structure of the catalytic fragment, which could be responsible for the above phenomenon. However, we cannot detect a similar increase in the enzymatic efficiency if we use small synthetic substrates. We concluded, therefore, that the increase of catalytic efficiency is a consequence of the interaction between the CCP2 module and the protein substrate. The CCP2 module very probably provides exosite(s) for the natural substrates. C1s has basically also two natural substrates: C4 and C2. It was also shown that in cultured fibroblast cells C1s cleaves insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) (Busby et al., 2000). The physiological relevance of this activity however is not fully understood since several other proteases were also shown to cleave IGFBP-5 (Hou et al., 2005). Interestingly, a recent paper describes that activated MASP-3 also specifically cleaves IGFBP-5 (Cortesio and Jiang, 2006). The role of the CCP modules was studied in the case of C1s, as well. The single SP domain was able to cleave the C2 substrate as efficiently as the entire molecule, while for the C4 cleavage the presence of the CCP modules was

necessary (Rossi et al., 1998). We can conclude that the activated C1s SP domain contains all the necessary binding sites for C2, but the SP domain is unable to cleave the C4 substrate without the contribution of the exosites present on the CCP modules. Recently this finding was reinforced by using a bioinformatical approach (Kerr et al., 2005). A randomized phage display peptide library of nine amino acids was used to elucidate the specificity of C1s. It was found that, aside from the crucial P1 position, the S3 and S2 subsites (in that order) played the greatest role in determining specificity. Based on the subsite preferences of C1s determined by the phage display method, a computer program was used to scan the human genome for potential substrates of C1s. The program correctly identified the cleavage site of C2, but in the case of C4 it predicted a false cleavage site. The oligopeptide consisting of nine amino acids was obviously enough to scan the substrate-binding subsites on the SP module, but it was not long enough to detect the exosites on the distant CCP modules. The exosites, however, should be taken into account while searching for potential substrates. The common physiological inhibitor of C1r and C1s is C1-inhibitor (Pappalardo et al., 2002). This serpintype inhibitor is a pseudosubstrate of the proteases. It forms covalent complexes with the activated C1r and C1s by freezing the proteolytic process in the acylenzyme intermediary state. The substrate specificity and physiological roles of MASPs have not been elucidated satisfactorily. We do not know too much about the enzymatic properties of MASP-3. In vitro experiments suggest that the zymogen MASP-3 is not able to self-activate, but no other protease has been identified to specifically cleave the zymogen. Active MASP-3 can cleave the synthetic substrate Z-Gly-Arg-S-Bzl with a good efficiency (kcat/ KM º 1.94 ¬ 104 M¿1 s¿1) (Zundel et al., 2004), but the only published protein substrate is IGFBP-5 (without kinetic constants). MASP-3 is the only protease in the C1r/C1s/MASPs family, which cannot be inhibited by C1-inhibitor. It was suggested that the biological role of MASP-3 could be the down-regulation of C4 and C2 cleaving activity of MASP-2, since MASP-2 and MASP3 can be found in the same MBL≠MASPs complex (Dahl et al., 2001). MASP-2 is the enzyme of the lectin pathway, which combines the functions of C1r and C1s of the classical pathway. MASP-2 can autoactivate and cleave C4 and C2 with high efficiency. A MASP-2 homodimer associated with an MBL molecule is the minimal complement activating unit of the lectin pathway (Chen and Wallis, 2001). The substrate specificity of MASP-2 is almost identical to that of C1s (except that it can cleave itself) (Ambrus et al., 2003), but it is a more effective enzyme on C4 than C1s (the kcat/KM values are

8.2 ¬ 105 and 2.2 ¬ 107 M¿1 s¿1 for C1s and MASP-2, respectively) (Rossi et al., 2001). The role of the CCP modules was also studied. Single SP domain of MASP-2 was able to cleave C2 as efficiently as the entire catalytic fragment, but for efficient C4 cleavage the presence of the CCP2 module was necessary (Ambrus et al., 2003). It is obvious that there is substrate-binding exosite on the CCP2 module for the C4 protein. Kinetic studies on chimeric C1s/MASP-2 molecules demonstrated that the higher C4 cleavage efficiency of MASP-2 arises from a higher substrate recognition efficacy of its CCP modules (Rossi et al., 2005). The zymogen form of MASP-2 was ¥ used to study the mechanism of autoactivation (Gal et al., 2005). The crystal structure of zymogen MASP-2 shows the typical features of a trypsin-like zymogen protease: the correctly oriented catalytic triad but severely distorted oxyanion hole and substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 2A). This single-chain molecule with inactive structure was not able to cleave small synthetic substrates. Surprisingly, however, the zymogen MASP-2 was able to cleave the big protein substrate C4 very efficiently. The ``zymogenicity'' (i.e. the ratio of the catalytic activities of the active and the zymogen forms) of MASP-2 for the C4 substrate was very low (about 8). Other proteases have high (107 for trypsin) or intermediate (4000 for factor XIIa) zymogenicity. Tissuetype plasminogen activator (tPA) also has low zymogenicity (about 5≠10), but in this case Lys156 forms a salt bridge with Asp194 stabilizing the active conformation of the single-chain form in the crystal structure (Renatus et al., 1997) (Fig. 2B). In the case of MASP-2, no similar structural phenomenon was observed so the source of the zymogen activity could be quite different. The structure of zymogen MASP-2 shows that the SP domain is very flexible: there are eight surface loops which change conformation during autoactivation. It is likely that the zymogen SP domain can spontaneously adopt an active-like conformation, but the equilibrium is strongly shifted towards the inactive form. This is the reason why we cannot detect any activity on small synthetic substrates. A big protein substrate, however, which can bind to the zymogen protease through a larger contact surface can stabilize the one-chain active conformation. In this respect, it should be mentioned that the structure of the CCP modules do not change during autoactivation. If there is binding site for the C4 substrate on the CCP module then it is already present on the zymogen MASP-2. Indeed, it was demonstrated that zymogen MASP-2 binds C4 (Chen and Wallis, 2004). This binding increases the local concentration of C4 around the SP domain and therefore facilitates the stabilization of the active-like conformation. The proteolytic activity of zymogen MASP-2 could be also responsible for the autoactivation, where zymogen molecule cleaves another zymogen molecule.

Fig. 2. Comparison of the active centre structure of zymogen MASP-2 (A) and tPA (B). Both tPA and MASP-2 have low zymogenicity, which means that the one-chain zymogen form has significant proteolytic activity. However, the structural background of this phenomenon is quite different in the case of the two enzymes. In tPA the salt bridge formed between Lys156 and Asp194 stabilizes the active conformation, while in the case of MASP-2 there is no similar interaction. The active form of one-chain MASP-2 is stabilized by the interaction with its protein substrate. Coordinates for tPA (1BDA) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank.

The catalytic properties of MASP-1 have not been completely elucidated, the physiological role of this protease is a subject under debate among researchers. MASP-1 is synthesized as a single-chain proenzyme and it can autoactivate like C1r and MASP-2. No cross activation between MASP-1 and MASP-2 has been detected, although the analogy with the C1r/C1s enzyme pair was tempting. The activated MASP-1 is a potent SP: it can cleave ester and peptide substrates. We could detect the proteolytic activity of MASP-1 using gelatin zymography (Fig. 3). C1r, C1s and MASP-2 were not able to digest gelatin in the polyacrylamide gel. These experiments demonstrate two important things: (i) MASP-1 is an active SP which can readily cleave protein substrates, and (ii) the substrate specificity of MASP-1 is not as narrow as that of the related complement SPs. The activity of MASP-1 was tested on C4 and C2 substrates. MASP-1 does not cleave C4 but it cleaves C2 (Rossi et al., 2001). The efficiency of C2 cleavage (kcat/KM º 3 ¬ 104 M¿1 s¿1) (Ambrus et al., 2003) is not as high as that of C1s or MASP-2, but it still indicates a specific proteolysis. The cleavage of C2 alone however is not enough to generate the C4b2a C3convertase enzyme complex. It was proposed that MASP-1 participates in complement activation by cleaving C2 after it has bound to the C4b fragment (Chen and Wallis, 2004). In this way, MASP-1 augments

complement activation but cannot initiate complement fixation in the absence of MASP-2. In order to estimate the physiological relevance of this proposal, two important questions should be answered. (1) Can MASP-1 and MASP-2 be present on the same MBL≠MASPs complex? It is very unlikely that MASP-1 and MASP-2 can cooperate if they are spatially separated on different complexes. Some researchers suggest that MBL can bind MASP-1 and MAp19 or MASP-2 and MASP-3 at the same time depending on the oligomerization status of MBL. However no MBL≠MASP-1≠MASP-2 complexes were detected (Dahl et al., 2001; Teillet et al., 2005; Mayilyan et al., 2006). (2) Is C2 cleavage the rate-limiting step of the C3-convertase formation in the lectin pathway? MASP-1 can enhance the efficiency of C4b2a formation only if C2 cleavage is the bottleneck of this process. We know that MASP-2 cleaves C4 very efficiently, but we do not know how efficiently the nascent C4b molecules bind to the cell surface. It was also demonstrated by several groups that MASP-1 can directly cleave C3 (Matsushita and Fujita, 1995; Matsushita et al., 2000; Dahl et al., 2001; Rossi et al., 2001). This cleavage was specific (it could be blocked by C1 inhibitor), but very inefficient. The kcat/ KM value of this reaction is 300 M¿1 s¿1 (Ambrus et al., 2003), which is only 0.1% of the previously reported

et al., 2003). Finally, it was proved that MASP-1 can cleave fibrinogen and factor XIII (plasma transglutaminase), the protein substrates of thrombin (Hajela et al., 2002). This activity of MASP-1 can represent an ancient form of innate immunity. The spread of the invading pathogen is prevented by the cross-linked fibrin clot, which is formed around the microorganism. This type of defence mechanism is well known in lower organisms (e.g., horseshoe crab haemolymph clotting cascade) (Bergner et al., 1996). Thus, MASP-1 can represent an important evolutionary linkage between the ancient coagulation based defence system and the modern complement activation (see below).

Evolutionary aspects
As the example of MASP-1/3 shows SP domains with different origins can combine with the same non-catalytic modules. It means that the catalytic and non-catalytic modules can have different evolutionary history in a mosaic protease. In the following chapter, we will focus on the evolution of the SP domains. It is possible to identify discrete markers of SP evolution that can be used for reconstruction of the chronology of SP domain evolution in proteolytic cascades. One of these evolution markers is the number of disulphide bridges. Vertebrate trypsins usually contain six disulphide bonds, but during evolution the number ¥ of disulphide bridges decreases (Kenesi et al., 2003). For example, human trypsin 1 contains only five and human trypsin 2 contains only four. The members of the S1 peptidase family contain at least three conserved disulphide bridges (C42≠C58, C168≠C182 and C191≠C220). Surprisingly however, in the case of the evolutionary modern proteases such as C1r, C1s (Arlaud and Gagnon, 1981), MASP-2 and MASP-3, the C42≠C58 disulphide bridge, the so called histidine loop, is missing. These SP domains have only two disulphide bonds. One might speculate that the stabilization role of the missing disulphide bonds is taken over by the stabilization effect of the neighbouring CCP modules (Harmat et al., 2004). MASP-1, however, has all the three conserved disulphide bonds typical for the S1 family, and the SP domain is encoded by six exons, whereas the SP domain of C1r, C1s, MASP-2 and MASP-3 is encoded by a single exon. These facts suggest that MASP-1 represents an earlier evolutionary stage of complement SP domains (Endo et al., 1998). In the case of factor D, C2, factor B and factor I additional disulphide bonds are also present. These proteases with four or five disulphide bridges may also represent ancient lineages of SPs compared to the C1r, C1s, MASP-2 family.

After electrophoresis the gel was washed with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 37 1C in the reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 4 mM CaCl2) and stained with Coomassie blue. MASP-1 digested the gelatin inside the gel, while MASP-2 did not. C1r and C1s were also inactive at gelatin zymography (data not shown). These results suggest that MASP-1 has a broader substrate specificity that the other members of this protease family.

efficiency of C3bBb, the alternative pathway C3convertase. It was also suggested that this weak C3 cleaving ability is enough to initiate the alternative pathway. We also cannot exclude that MASP-1 activity can result in C3 cleavage by an indirect manner in the blood plasma. In order to prove the existence of an independent MASP-1 activation route, efficient lectin pathway activity should be unambiguously demonstrated in the serum of MASP-2 knock out mouse or in the serum of a MASP-2-deficient patient (StengaardPedersen et al., 2003). A third possible natural substrate for MASP-1 is fibrinogen. In a competing oligopeptide substrate library assay, MASP-1 showed extreme Arg selectivity at the P1 position (Ambrus et al., 2003). This activation profile was very similar to that of thrombin. Later it was also shown that MASP-1 can cleave oligopeptide substrates designed for measuring thrombin activity. Thrombin inhibitors (Z-D-Phe-Pro-methoxypropylboroglycinepinanediol ester and anti-thrombin III in the presence of heparin) inhibited the activity of MASP-1 (Presanis

Fig. 4. Evolutionary scheme of serine proteases of the complement, blood coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. The proteases are categorized according to the three phylogenetic markers defined by Krem and Di Cera (2001). Each box shows a marker configuration (left side) and the protease(s) bearing that configuration (right side). Arrows indicate possible evolutionary routes. f, factor (e.g. fD, factor D); tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator.

mosaic protease, but it consists of a single SP domain only. Krem and Di Cera (2001) used evolutionary markers in the sequences of SPs that form the highly conserved catalytic machinery of the enzymes. SPs can be divided into discrete lineages by using these evolutionary markers. The marker composition of a discrete lineage also indicates the relative age of the lineage. They used three such markers: the active-site nucleophile Ser195, another highly conserved serine, Ser214 which stabilizes the position of Asp102 in the catalytic triad, and the amino acid residue at position 225. In the case of the two serines, there is a non-random dichotomy as to whether TCN (N º any base) or AGY (Y º C or T) codons encode these amino acids in the genome. At position 225, there is Pro or Tyr determining the Na+-induced allosteric regulation of the catalytic activity. TCN and Pro225 designate the ancient while AGY and Tyr225 designate the modern lineages. Thus, Ser195 (TCN)/ Ser214 (TCN)/Pro225 is the most primordial marker configuration whereas Ser195 (AGY)/Ser214 (AGY)/ Tyr225 is the most modern one. Applying this classification pattern to the SPs of the cascade systems Krem and Di Cera (2002) came to the conclusion that a single ancestral developmental/immunity cascade existed in an early evolutionary stage and that modern vertebrate

blood clotting emerged as a by-product of innate immunity. Our finding that MASP-1 cleaves the substrates of thrombin provides strong evidence that the complement and blood clotting cascade systems are closely related. Paying closer attention to marker configurations of the enzymes of complement, blood coagulation and fibrinolytic systems (Fig. 4) we can see that factor D belongs to the most primordial lineage. MASP-1 is also a relatively ancient enzyme, since it belongs to the lineage Ser195 (TCN)/Ser214 (TCN)/ Tyr225, a one-marker change from the primordial configuration (step 1). The enzymes responsible for dissolving the blood clot (enzymes of the fibrinolytic system) also appear at this step. This fact reinforces the view that the ancient coagulation cascade system, which served an immunological role, developed together with the fibrinolytic system early in evolution, and that the fibrinolytic system predated the modern vertebrate blood clotting system. C2, factor B and factor I can also be found at this evolutionary level, indicating that they belong to the ancient complement proteases. The fact that factor D and factor B exhibit ancient marker configurations supports the idea that the alternative pathway predated the classical one. At step 2 (twomarker change from the primordial configuration and one-marker change from MASP-1) we can find C1r,

C1s, MASP-2 and MASP-3. These enzymes are the evolutionary modern enzymes of the classical and lectin pathways. Thrombin, the terminal protease of the blood clotting cascade, appears also at this level, while the upstream enzymes of the clotting cascade appear at step 3, indicating that the vertebrate clotting system arose late in evolution. In conclusion, we can say that much evidence suggests that the complement and coagulation cascades are functionally and evolutionarily closely related and MASP-1 represents an important linkage between the proteolytic cascade systems.
