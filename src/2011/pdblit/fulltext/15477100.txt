Abstract Objectives: To develop an assay for the determination of ZAG in human serum, and to investigate its clinical relevance as a marker of metabolic syndrome. Design and methods: A new sandwich ELISA was introduced and clinically tested. Results: ZAG serum level did not differentiate healthy subjects (27.4 ± 8.3 mg/L; N = 132) from patients with metabolic syndrome (24.9 ± 8.1; N = 92). ZAG correlated with glucose, creatinine and uric acid. Conclusion: The immunoassay offers a new research tool for glucose metabolism. © 2007 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Introduction Zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a 41-kDa glycoprotein assigned to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I family of proteins. ZAG is present in a variety of epithelia and is secreted into many body fluids [1]. It was demonstrated that, in contrast to class I MHC proteins, ZAG does not bind peptides or beta2-microglobulin and its functions are diverged from functions of MHC class I molecules [2] and [3]. ZAG was suggested to be involved in various biological processes including regulation of melanin production by melanocytes, prostate and bladder cancer, cachexia, obesity and inhibition of cell proliferation. It was classified as a novel

adipokine produced and secreted by mature adipocytes in both white and brown adipose tissue with autocrine effects on the reduction of adiposity in cachexia [4]. ZAG expression is regulated particularly through TNF-alpha and the PPAR-gamma nuclear receptor [5] and its lipolytic effect is attributed to the upregulation of uncoupling protein (UCP-1) resulting from activation of beta(3)-adrenoreceptor. Interestingly, overexpression of ZAG in 3T3-L1 adipocytes has been reported to lead to an increase in adiponectin mRNA levels [6]. Although ZAG is related to lipid loss and also stimulates expression of adiponectin, it is not clear whether serum ZAG level is associated with obesity or metabolic syndrome. In addition, studies have focused on mRNA expression rather than protein quantification and only two publications using in-house immunoassay [7] or LC-MS/MS method have been reported [8]. The aim of our study was to establish an immunoassay for the quantitative determination of ZAG and to investigate its potential clinical relevance as a serum marker of metabolic syndrome or obesity.

Materials and methods ZAG immunoassay development The ZAG enzyme-linked immunoassay employs specific rabbit polyclonal anti-human ZAG antibody (Biovendor, Brno, Czech Republic), which was raised against recombinant human ZAG (Biovendor) as an antigen. Antibody was purified on a column with immobilized recombinant human ZAG and used as the capture and detection antibody. The recombinant protein was produced in human embryonic kidney 293 cell line and contains 290-amino-acid residues of the human ZAG, the amino acid sequence (aa 13­290) is identical to swiss-Prot-P25311 (aa 18­295, mature zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein). The microtiter plates (High Binding type, Corning Costar, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with specific rabbit antihuman ZAG antibody: 100 L/well, 2 g/mL in 0.1 M carbonate­bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.4) overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed once with TBS-Tw (0.05 M Tris­HCl; 0.15 M NaCl; pH = 7.2; 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20) on the Columbus washer (Tecan, Zurich, Switzerland). Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 250 L/well of 3% bovine serum albumin and 4% sucrose in TBS-Tw for 30 min at 25 °C. After aspiration, standards or serum samples diluted 1:5000 with dilution buffer (StabilZyme-HRP, SurModics, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) were pipetted in duplicates at 100 L/well. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After five washes with TBS-Tw, 100 L/well of horseradish peroxidase-labeled specific rabbit polyclonal anti-human ZAG antibody (Biovendor) was added and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After five washes, 100 L/well of tetramethylbenzidine substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was then added and the plate was incubated for another 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped with 100 L/well of sulfuric acid (0.2 M). The developed color was determined by reading the plate on the microplate reader Max002 (Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, VA, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. The recombinant human ZAG (Biovendor) was used as the standard. The protein content of recombinant ZAG was determined by bicinchonic acid assay and its purity confirmed by electrophoresis. Standards were prepared at concentrations of 1.5­50 g/L in assay dilution buffer. Study subjects The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of the Hospital Sternberk, Czech Republic. A total of 136 non-obese, healthy individuals (81 men and 55 women, age 64.0 ± 13.0) and 92 individuals with metabolic syndrome (41 men and 51 women, age 63.0 ± 11.5) were recruited for our study. The criteria of metabolic syndrome were proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Metabolic syndrome was identified as the presence of three or more of these components: (1) elevated waist circumference (men:  102 cm, women:  88 cm); (2) elevated triglycerides ( 1.7 mmol/L); (3) reduced HDL cholesterol

(men: b1.0 mmol/L, women: b 1.3 mmol/L); (4) elevated blood pressure ( 130/85 mm Hg) and/or receiving blood pressure lowering drugs; (5) elevated fasting glucose ( 5.6 mmol/L). Sampling and data measurement Anthropometric (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference), clinical (systolic and diastolic pressures) and laboratory fasting analyses were performed. Blood samples were drawn under aseptic precautions from vena cubiti, after a 5-min rest in the half-sitting position. Serum samples were separated in a cooled centrifuge at 3000×g for 20 min and immediately analyzed for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, high sensitivity CRP, creatinine, uric acid, AST, ALT (all Siemens, Advia 1650) and insulin (Siemens, Immulite 2000). ZAG serum level was determined by the assay presented above and adiponectin serum level was determined by a commercially available ELISA kit (Biovendor, Max002 Dynatech) in serum samples stored at -80 °C. Quicki index (quantitative insulin sensitivity check index) was calculated according to the previously published formula [9]. Statistical analysis The data obtained were processed by means of the software Medcalc (Medcalc, Mariakerke, Belgium). The value p b 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Because of anomalous data distribution in evaluated parameters, Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to establish the association between ZAG levels and the other parameters. Comparison of ZAG serum values between subjects with and without metabolic syndrome was performed by either the Student's t test or Mann­Whitney test according to the data distribution. All data are presented as medians and/or means ± standard deviation. Results Performance characteristics of human ZAG ELISA The limit of detection of the assay was 0.22 g/L and the limit of quantification was 1.1 mg/L. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was determined by replicate analysis (n = 8) of four serum samples at concentration 47.9, 96.6, 118.2 and 145.0 mg/L. The intra-assay CV ranged from 3.2 to 5.1%. The inter-assay CV was determined by duplicate measurement of serum samples at baseline concentration 37.6, 92.8, 110.5 and 144.4 mg/L in separate assays (n = 8). The inter-assay CV range was 5.8­11.9%. To analyze the spiking recovery, human serum samples from three subjects with baseline ZAG levels of 14.1, 19.9 and 16.1 mg/L were spiked with increasing amounts of recombinant protein (+ 12.5, + 25 and + 50 mg/L) and assayed. The mean recovery was 99.8% (recovery range 83.9­122%). Dilution linearity was determined in serum samples from another three subjects with baseline ZAG levels of 44.5, 63.4 and 54.4 mg/L, samples were serially diluted in assay dilution buffer. The mean recovery was 101% (recovery range 89.4­

118.5%). No interference was found to human leukocyte antigen-G (coming under MHC I protein family) and the following human adipocytokines: leptin, resistin, angiopoietin like protein 4, adiponectin and visfatin. Proteins were diluted with the assay dilution buffer at the following concentrations: human leukocyte antigen-G at 250 U/mL, leptin, resistin, angiopoietin like protein 4 and visfatin at 50 g/L, and adiponectin at 20 mg/L. Clinical data The study analyzed 230 subjects, of which 132 were in good health while 92 probands suffered from metabolic syndrome. We did not observe any significant difference in serum ZAG level between healthy men and women either in group with BMI b 24kg/m2 (men:27.2 ± 12.3mg/L,women:27.5 ± 5.2mg/L) or BMI N 30 kg/m2 (men: 27.4 ± 4.5 mg/L, women: 23.4 ± 4.9 mg/L). We did not find a significant difference between healthy subjects and probands with metabolic syndrome (24.9 vs. 27.4 mg/L; see Table 1 and Fig. 1). Serum ZAG level correlated with glucose (r = 0.18; p b 0.05), creatinine (r = 0.25;

p b 0.05) and uric acid (r = 0.2; p b 0.05). No significant correlation was found between serum ZAG and BMI, WC, blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,

LDL-cholesterol, Quicki index or the number of components of metabolic syndrome (data not shown). Discussion In our study, serum ZAG concentrations in healthy subjects are approximately 7-fold higher than corresponding serum ZAG levels detected by LC-MS/MS [8] (24.9 vs. 3.65 mg/L). The concentration of ZAG in normal serum using various in-house immunoassays has been reported as between 25 and 700 mg/mL [7,10]. Data comparison among these studies demonstrates definite differences between various methods and indicates the requirement to establish an international standard. The ELISA method that we describe shows appropriate performance characteristics in terms of sensitivity, intra- and inter-assay precision, analytical recovery and dilution linearity of serum samples. Despite of the hypothesis that ZAG might be a parameter of body fat composition [11] and [12], we did not demonstrate diagnostic efficacy of serum ZAG as a marker of metabolic syndrome or obesity. This may be explained by an influence of food intake, energy balance or hormonal interactions on serum ZAG level in human or may result from the fact that ZAG is present in various tissues and body fluids. We also did not find any correlation between serum ZAG and Quicki index, in spite of its weak positive association with glucose, and therefore we consider serum ZAG not to be related to insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, we introduce a new analytical tool for the study of ZAG. Our results do not support the hypothesis that serum ZAG may be associated with metabolic syndrome or obesity.
