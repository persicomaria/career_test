The optimization of a series of 5-phenylacetyl 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole derivatives toward the inhibition of Aurora kinases led to the identification of compound 9d. This is a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases that also shows low nanomolar potency against additional anticancer kinase targets. Based on its high antiproliferative activity on different cancer cell lines, favorable chemico-physical and pharmacokinetic properties, and high efficacy in in vivo tumor models, compound 9d was ultimately selected for further development.
Introduction Mammalian Aurora kinases constitute a small family of three closely related Ser/Thr protein kinases, namely, Aurora-A, -B, and -C. They have different functions, subcellular localization, or timing of expression and are essential to secure the correct progress of cell cycle during mitosis or meiosis.1,2 In fact, they are key regulators of major mitotic events such as centrosome maturation and separation, mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome separation, and cytokinesis.2 Several lines of evidence indicate Aurora-A and -B as attractive targets for pharmacological intervention in oncology because, for example, both are found to be overexpressed in cancer.3,4 The gene locus of Aurora-A maps to 20q13, a chromosomal region frequently amplified in a variety of human tumors.5 Aurora-A can act as an oncogene because overexpression of Aurora-A leads to cell transformation in vitro,6 and transgenic mice overexpressing Aurora-A in the mammary gland develop mammary tumors at a high incidence.7 Finally, "small molecule" inhibitors of Aurora kinases demonstrate efficacy in animal tumor models, and the first compounds have entered clinical studies.8-10 We have previously described a novel series of Aurora kinases inhibitors identified from the combinatorial expansion of the 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole bi-cycle, a versatile scaffold designed to target the ATP pocket of protein kinases.11 In particular, the development of the pyrrolopyrazole subclasses characterized by a urea substituent at position 5 led to the identification of PHA-680632 (1), which demonstrated high in vitro antiproliferative activity on a wide range of cancer cell lines and significant tumor growth inhibition in different animal tumor models at well-tolerated doses.12 In this paper, we describe the optimization of the analogue 5-amido-pyrrolopyrazole subclasses, up to the identification and preliminary characterization of a potent Aurora inhibitor selected for evaluation as a potential anticancer agent.

Several 5-amido derivatives endowed with good Aurora-A inhibitory activity were initially identified through a preliminary combinatorial expansion of the pyrrolopyrazole scaffold. All these early hits were characterized by an arylacetic substituent at position 5 such as compounds 2 and 3 (Table 1).11 To highlight areas for possible optimization of the inhibitory activity, the crystal structure of compound 3 was solved as a complex with Aurora-A kinase and refined at a resolution of 2.0 Å (Figure 1). As would be expected, the binding mode of 3 is very similar to that reported for PHA-680632 (1). However, the 5-amidothiophene substituent adopts a different spatial position to the urea-containing compound. Rather than being situated under the glycine-rich loop, as is the case for the diethyl-phenyl urea group of PHA-680632, the amido-thiophene is directed away from the loop and packs around Leu 263. It was envisaged, therefore, that a substituent at the pro-R position of the benzylic methylene could adopt a position similar to the diethyl benzene of PHA680632 under the glycine-rich loop and near to the amino nitrogen of Lys 162. In the structure reported here, such a substituent would be blocked by the presence of the activation loop that adopts a position with His 280 packing onto the aryl ring of the inhibitor. However, because this loop is very flexible and in other Aurora-A structures is not seen, its position in this structure was not thought to be of importance with regard to what substituents would fit in the binding site. Substitutions at the pro-S position were thought to be less favorable due to the proximity of Val 147. Following this hypothesis and assuming that the phenyl group of compound 2 would adopt the same position as the thiophene of compound 3, we undertook the synthesis of a small series of pyrrolopyrazoles branched to the CH2 of the phenylacetyl moiety in position 5, mainly with H-bond acceptor groups targeting a possible interaction with the Lys 162 hydrogens. In this series, we kept fixed at position 3 the already optimized 4-(1-methylpiperazin-4-yl)benzamide, which in the analogue 5-urea subclasses provided inhibitors endowed with adequate aqueous solubility and high potency in cellular assays. The general synthetic route outlined in Scheme 1 was used to prepare the target compounds 9a-f.

was performed as described in our previous report through protection of the pyrazole moiety with ethyl carbamate, Nacylation with p-piperazinylbenzoic acyl chloride, and Boc removal with HCl in dioxane.11 The available pyrrolidinic nitrogen of 7 easily reacted with activated acids to give compounds 8a-f, which by treatment with triethylamine in methanol furnished the final compounds 9a-f. Compounds 9a-f were initially evaluated for their Aurora-A inhibitory activity in a biochemical assay and their ability to block cell proliferation (Table 2). Accumulation of cells with g4 N DNA content, the phenotype typically induced by most known Aurora inhibitors is an indication for inhibiting also Aurora-B.13,14 Data shown in Table 2 indicate that the benzylic substitution at the pro-R position significantly increases inhibitory potency in this series and resulted in compounds endowed with potent antiproliferative and cell cycle block activity. To confirm the binding hypothesis, the structure of Aurora-A was solved in complex with compound 9d. Although the crystals only diffracted to 3 Å, the electron density for the inhibitor clearly showed that the compound bound as expected, with the benzyl group positioned as the thiophene of the previous structure and the amino nitrogen of Lys 162 within hydrogenbonding distance of the oxygen of the pro-R methoxy substituent (2.6 Å; see Supporting Information). In contrast, when data were collected from crystals of Aurora-A in complex with a compound with a methyl group at the pro-S position (9e), the

associated electron density indicated that the methyl group occupied the position of the phenyl ring in 9d and the ring position of the methoxy (unpublished). It should be noted, however, that even compound 9c, which is unable to form a hydrogen bond with Lys 126, is much more active than the unsubstituted compound 2. Here we report the preliminary in vitro and in vivo profile of 9d, which emerged from a deeper characterization of this series as the compound with the best balance in terms of tumor target kinase inhibition profile, pharmaceutical properties for development, and efficacy in animal models.

Compound 9d was seen to be a potent, ATP-competitive inhibitor of Aurora-A kinase, with an apparent Ki value of 2.5 ( 0.3 nM. Its selectivity was evaluated in an in-house panel representing diverse families of Tyr and Ser-Thr kinases. Data reported in Table 3 show that, besides inhibiting all three Aurora kinases, 9d also inhibits an additional set of protein kinases, namely, ABL, RET, TRKA, and FGFR1 in the nanomolar range. Notably, all of them have been independently suggested as viable targets for oncology drug discovery. In particular, the therapeutic value of Imatinib clearly validated the approach of ABL inhibition for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia15 (CML), while oncogenic activation of RET tyrosine kinase has been associated with medullary thyroid carcinomas and, together with TRKA activation, to papillary thyroid carcinomas.16,17 In addition, the activated TRKA oncogene has been associated with other human malignancies, in particular, prostate cancer.18 We expect that the particular kinase inhibition profile of 9d, in which an antimitotic activity is complemented by the inhibition of targets relevant for specific cancer types, could offer promising opportunities for clinical development and therapeutic use, although we may face the risk of a decreased tolerance in patients. In this regard, specific studies are currently ongoing to address two crucial questions: first, whether the inhibition of these additional targets contributes to the antitumoral effects or is rather obscured by the dominant phenotype induced by aurora inhibition; and second, whether the PK/PD requirements for the inhibition in vivo of these different targets are compatible with administration schedules, which might be limited by the antimitotic nature of the compound. Compound 9d demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity (IC50 values ranging from 28 to 140 nM, Table 4) in cell lines originating from various human tumor types such as HCT-116 (colon carcinoma), A2780 (ovarian carcinoma), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), and HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma). Similarly to what has been described for other Aurora-A and -B inhibitors, the incubation of different tumor cell lines with 9d results in a substantial increase in 4 N DNA and polyploid (g8 N DNA) populations. We observed that the extent of polyploidy induction depends on the genetic background of the

tested cell line (data not shown). As an example, the cell cycle profile of HCT-116 cells treated for 24 h with different concentrations of the compound is reported in Figure 2. Finally, 9d induces a complete suppression of phosphorylation of the substrate of Aurora kinases, histone H3 at serine 10, which is widely regarded as a marker of Aurora B inhibition (Figure 3).20 Major pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained in vivo after iv administration of 10 mg/kg of 9d to male CD-1 mice cannulated into the superior vena cava (Table 5). Plasma levels were detectable up to 6 h post-dosing, giving an apparent average terminal half-life of about 1.4 h. The clearance was about 70% of the hepatic blood flow and the volume of distribution higher than the total body water, indicating extensive tissue distribution. These pharmacokinetic properties, coupled with a high aqueous solubility (>15 mg/mL as the hydrochloride salt at pH 5.5) and a high stability of the resulting solution (shelf life: 36 months at 5 °C) makes compound 9d well-suited for development as an injectable therapeutic agent. In vivo, 9d was seen to be efficacious in a range of tumor models. As an example, Figure 4 illustrates the dose-dependent growth inhibition induced in the HL-60 xenograft model. Tested at doses between 7.5 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg given iv bid for 5 days, the compound showed good dose dependency and a tumor growth inhibition of up to 98%. At the highest dose (30 mg/ Kg) there was evidence of tumor regression and, in two cases out of eight, cures. The maximal and reversible body weight loss at this dose was 16%.

Conclusions The data presented in this report were the starting point for a deeper evaluation of safety and efficacy of compound 9d, which has been ultimately selected for clinical studies. The therapeutic value of compound 9d for the treatment of both solid tumors and leukemias is currently under investigation in advanced clinical trials. Experimental Section

The residual signal of the deuterated solvent was used. Synthesis of 8a and 8c-f. The acyl chlorides, when not commercially available, were prepared according to standard procedures: oxalyl chloride (728 µL, 8.3 mmol) was added to a solution of the required acid (0.83 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) and

DMF (50 µL). After stirring the mixture at room temperature overnight, volatiles were carefully removed under reduced pressure. The resulting acyl chlorides were dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL) and added to a solution of ethyl 3-{[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1yl)benzoyl]amino}-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-1(4H)-carboxylate trihydrochloride 7 (300 mg, 0.59 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) and DIEA (610 µL, 3.6 mmol) under stirring at room temperature.
