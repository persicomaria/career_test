The multi-domain serine protease C2 provides the catalytic activity for the C3 and C5- convertases of the classical and lectin pathways of complement activation. Formation of these convertases requires the Mg2+-dependent binding of C2 to C4b, and the subsequent cleavage of C2 by C1s or MASP2, respectively. The C-terminal fragment C2a consisting of a serine protease (SP) and a von Willebrand factor type A (vWFA) domain, remains attached to C4b, forming the C3 convertase, C4b2a. Here, we present the crystal structure of Mg2+-bound C2a to 1.9 Å resolution in comparison to its homolog Bb, the catalytic subunit of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. Although the overall domain arrangement of C2a is similar to Bb, there are certain structural differences. Unexpectedly, the conformation of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site and the position of the 7 helix of the vWFA domain indicate a co-factor-bound or open conformation. The active site of the SP domain is in a zymogen-like inactive conformation. On the basis of these structural features, we suggest a model for the initial steps of C3 convertase assembly.

Introduction
Complement is an intricate system of about 35 interactive proteins that recognize and eliminate invading microorganisms and altered cells of the host. It is an important component of host defense, participating in both innate and adaptive immunity.1 Inappropriate activation and/or inefficient regulation of complement can lead to inflammatory or immunologic diseases. Effective pharmacological control of such complex system requires a detailed understanding of the topology and structure of binding and catalytic sites of its constituent proteins, particularly of the pivotal complement enzymes, C3 and C5 convertases. Depending on the nature of the invading pathogen and the availability of specific antibodies,

complement activation is initiated through one of three pathways termed classical, lectin, and alternative (Figure 1(a)). The end result of complement activation is the formation of the convertases, which produce biologically active protein fragments by cleaving C3 and C5. The classical and lectin pathway formation of the C3 convertase proceeds through three steps: First, cleavage of C4 by C1s or MASP2 results in the covalent attachment of its major fragment, C4b, to the surface of the activator, next, C2-Mg2+ binds to C4b, and last, C2 is cleaved by C1s or MASP2, giving rise to the C4b2a C3 convertase. A similar reaction sequence leads to assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. Attachment of C3b to either C3 convertase changes its specificity from C3 to C5 (Figure 1(a)). C2 is a glycosylated modular protein consisting of three domains (Figure 1(b)). The N-terminal domain comprising three complement control protein modules is termed C2b and is cleaved off during formation of the C3 convertase. The middle domain is a typical von Willebrand factor type A (vWFA) domain containing a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), similar to that present in

225 factor B6 and of BbC428-C435.7 The latter has an engineered disulfide bond aimed at locking the vWFA domain in the ligand-bound "open" conformation by analogy to the I domain of integrins.8­10 Here, we present the structure of Mg2+-bound C2a to 1.9 Å resolution. Surprisingly, the structure of the vWFA domain of C2a has an open conformation very similar to that of BbC428­C435.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure of C2a Attempts to produce crystals of intact recombinant C2 expressed in insect cells by the hangingdrop, vapor-diffusion method yielded diffractionquality single crystals of C2a. The identity of the fragment was indicated by the unit cell volume of the crystals and their solvent content, and by SDSPAGE of dissolved single crystals (Figure 1(c)); it was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation, which yielded the sequence KIQIQ, which is the N terminus of C2a.4 A trypsin-like protease contaminant not detectable by SDS-PAGE could be responsible for the cleavage of C2 or, but less likely, cleavage might be the result of autocatalytic activity of highly concentrated C2. Under similar crystallization conditions, C2 treated with diisopropylfluoro-phosphate produced no crystals. A diffraction data set to 2.3 Å resolution was collected when C2a crystals, obtained from recombinant C2 purified using buffers containing 5 mM EDTA, were exposed to an in-house X-ray source. We collected diffraction data to 1.9 Å resolution using the SERCAT 19-BM beamline after soaking similarly obtained C2a crystals in 5 mM MgCl2 overnight. The two crystal structures refined using resolution diffraction data above 2.3 Å and 1.9 Å, respectively are almost identical (rms deviation 0.80 Å), except that the latter has clear density for the bound Mg2+, whereas the former has weak density at the same position, consistent with a water molecule. The crystallographic data and the

the I domains of integrins.2 The C-terminal domain is an atypical chymotrypsin-like serine protease (SP) displaying trypsin-like specificity.3 The main difference from typical SPs is that transition from the zymogen to the catalytically active form is not associated with the formation of a new N terminus. Instead, the SP domain of C2 remains linked to the vWFA domain and expresses catalytic activity against C3 only in the context of the C4b2a complex. The structure of factor B is similar to that of C2, and the two proteins display 39% amino acid residue identity (Figure 1(b)).4,5 In earlier studies, we explored the catalytic apparatus of the alternative pathway convertases by solving the crystal structure of the SP domain of

226 refinement statistics for the two structures are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The data indicate that Mg2+ binding does not induce a conformational change in C2a. Therefore, the requirement for Mg2+ for formation of the C4bC2 complex may indicate the requirement for a residue(s) of C4b to complete the coordination of the metal ion. We refer to the 1.9 Å, Mg2+-bound crystal structure throughout. The three-dimensional structure of the C2a molecule is shown in Figure 2(a). The overall dimensions of the molecule are 90 Å × 50 Å × 50 Å; it consists of two compact domains, vWFA and SP, and has the shape of a distorted dumbbell, a close match to its appearance by electron microscopy. 11 The two domains are joined by a 13 residue linker (433­446; amino acid residue numbering throughout is from the N terminus of the mature secreted protein). The linker contains a Cys residue at position 443, which is disulfide-bonded to Cys561 of the SP domain (Figure 2(a)). The vWFA domain contains 209 residues (224­ 432) including 13 of the C2b-C2a linker at the N terminus. The domain proper comprises seven  helices, six  strands, and three 310 helices, and adopts the dinucleotide binding or Rossmann fold with a central  sheet surrounded by  helices (Figures 2(a) and 3(a)). A shallow crevice present at the bottom of the domain contains the MIDAS motif, while the top of the domain is linked to the SP domain. The latter comprises 286 residues (447­732) and adopts a typical chymotrypsin fold with two antiparallel  barrels, each composed of six  strands surrounded by  and 310 helical segments. The catalytic center is situated topologically at the opposite pole of the distorted dumbbell from the MIDAS motif of the vWFA domain (Figure 2(a)). C2a has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites, two in the vWFA domain (Asn270 and 313) and four in the SP domain (Asn447, 451, 601, and 631). The presence of bulky electron densities at these sites except for Asn451, which is exposed on a flexible loop, gives clear indication that these residues are glycosylated. Asn447 is buried at the domain interface cleft and, as a result, the associated density is clearer and reveals more sugar residues than were

seen at the other sites. Well-defined density is seen for at least two complete N-acetylglucosamine residues at this site. The other four sites, Asn270, 313, 601, and 631 show the presence of at least one sugar residue. An extended shapeless bulky electron density into the solvent, linked to all of these single sugar residues suggests that additional sugar moieties are present. Bb has only two glycosylation sites, both in the vWFA domain; however, no strong density was seen at either site in the crystal structure of BbC428­C435 , although like C2a it was expressed in insect cells.7 Structure of the vWFA domain Figure 3(a) shows the overall similarities between vWFA domains of C2 and factor B. By comparison to structurally homologous integrin -chain I domains, the vWFA domain of C2a adopts a conformation similar to that of the ligand-bound open form.8­10 It has been shown that ligand binding induces

changes mainly in two features of I domains. The most impressive change is a 10 Å shift of the C-terminal 7 helix away from the MIDAS motif. This large movement is associated with changes in the conformational angles of residues that con-

tribute to the MIDAS motif. Superposition of the vWFA domain of C2a on the I domains of M and 2 in the ligand-bound open conformations (1IDO and 1DZI) yielded rms deviations of 1.3 Å and 1.5 Å for 138 and 124 common C

228 atoms, respectively. A similar comparison of C2a with the 2 I domain in the ligand-free closed conformation (1AOX) yielded rms deviation of 1.6 Å for 120 common C atoms. The main difference between C2a and 2 in the open conformation is in the position of the 7 helix that is 3 Å closer to the MIDAS motif in C2a. However, the 7 helix of C2a is much closer to that of the open than that in the closed conformation of 2 (Figure 3(b)). More importantly, the linker between C2a and C2b domains, i.e. the N terminus of the crystallized C2a fragment is observed occupying the exact space in which the shifted 7 helix of BbC428­C435 was positioned (Figure 3(c)). This observation is significant, since the co-factor induced conformational changes emanating from the MIDAS site, and by shifting the 7 helix can push out and expose the scissile bond in the interdomain linker between C2a and C2b, and Bb and Ba, respectively, facilitating the proteolytic cleavage of C2b and Ba domains by C1s and factor D, respectively. This co-factor-mediated conformational changes playing a role in N-terminal domain cleavage might be specially true for factor B activation, since factor D can cleave factor B only when the latter is bound to the cofactor C3b, mediated by a Mg2+. The placement and direction of C2a N terminus, directed towards the face in which the S1 site is located on the SP domain, possibly suggest the orientation and location of C2b in relation to the catalytic site of C2. As shown in Figure 3(c), the position of the 7 helix of C2a is determined, to a large extent, by the N-terminal region of the fragment, which precludes further upward movement of the helix. Moreover, the torsional angles (Table 3) and positions (Figure 4(a)) of residues of the MIDAS motif of C2a are similar to those of the open conformation of 2. Two crystal structures of the vWFA domain of factor B have been published, and both are in the open conformation. For the recombinant vWFA domain (1Q0P), the open conformation in the absence of bound co-factor C3b was attributed to a fortuitous crystallographic contact that completes the octahedral coordination of Mg2+ at MIDAS, representing a ligand-mimetic conformation.12 For the vWFA domain of BbC428­C435 (1RRK), the open conformation was intentional and attributed to the introduction of the disulfide bond.7 Superposition of the vWFA domain of C2a to that of factor B (1Q0P) (Figure 3(a)) resulted in rms deviation of 1.0 Å for 164 common C atoms.

ween the two structures are: (1) a 13-residue fragment of the C2b-C2a linker is not present in the vWFA domain of factor B. (2) The loop between 4 and D is three residues longer in C2a. (3) In the 5-E loop, a short 310 helix present at the beginning of E in C2a, is extended by five residues in factor B. (4) The short loop between E and 6 is longer in C2a by about one residue. (5) The 7 helix is disordered and not seen in the factor B vWFA domain, while its position is clear in C2a. This may be due to the stabilization of the 7 helix of C2a by a number of close interactions with the SP domain and with the N-glycan attached to Asn447 at the domain interface. Superposition of the C2a vWFA domain to that of BbC428­C435 (1RRK) yields an rms deviation of 0.9 Å

229 Structure of the SP domain The SP domain of C2a (Figure 5(a)) adopts a structural fold identical with that of the isolated SP domain of factor B6 (1IDLE) and of BbC428­C4357 (1RRK). When the above two structures are superimposed on the SP domain of C2a, the observed rms deviation is 1.2 Å for 192 common C atoms and 1.2 Å for 235 common C atoms, respectively. Comparison with the typical SP structures of trypsin (1TRN) and chymotrypsin (2CGA) yields rms deviations of 1.3 Å and 1.2 Å for 157 and 151 common C residues, respectively. A unique loop segment Cys564 -Asn589 is inserted in the middle of the SP domain of C2, adopting a helix-loop-helix conformation with a disulfide bond (Cys564Cys580) linking the N-terminal ends of the two helices. This feature is observed also in BbC428­C435,7 but is absent from typical SPs. Perona and Craik14 described eight conserved loops that determine the geometry of the S1 pocket and the subsite specificity. Of these, loops 1, A, and D are shorter in C2a than in Bb, while loops B and C are of equal length, and loops 3 and E are longer in C2a. The most prominent difference between the SP domains of C2a and Bb is observed in the length, composition, and flexibility of loop 2 (Figure 5(b)). The backbone of the loop is clear in C2a, while no electron density was seen for the corresponding loop of the factor B and BbC428­C435 SP domains.7,15 However, clear density for most of the backbone of the loop was seen in the structure of the BbC428­C435BCX583 inhibitor complex.7,15 The N-terminal end of the C2a SP domain is connected to the vWFA domain through a 13 residues linker, whereas the corresponding linker is 14 residues long in Bb. In all other SPs, transition from the zymogen to the catalytically active form is associated with the generation of a new N terminus. + The free NH3 at the terminus forms an ion pair with the carboxylate side-chain of Asp194 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) that is adjacent to the catalytic Ser195. Formation of this bond is thought to cause rigidity of the S1 pocket suitable for substrate binding, and to force the 192­194 segment to adopt an active oxyanion hole -turn conformation, one of the prerequisite structural correlates of catalytic efficiency. In the SP domain of C2a, although the overall backbone conformation of the Ser653(189)-Glu658(194) (the numbers in parentheses are for chymotrypsinogen) segment is similar to the corresponding segments of activated SPs, its conformation is zymogen-like due to the inward orientation of the carbonyl oxygen atom of Lys656 (192) and its interactions (3.2 Å separation) with the hydroxyl group of Ser659(195). As a result, the hydroxyl group of Ser659(195) is not free to perform a nucleophilic attack on the scissile bond of the substrate and the Lys656(192)-Glu658(194) segment adopts a 310 helix conformation (Figure 5(b)), similar to that observed in the factor B and BbC428­C435 SP domains. The corresponding separation between the main-chain carbonyl group of Arg671(192) to the

for 164 common C atoms. The main difference between the two structures is in the loops between 4 and 4, and between 5 and E, which are not seen in BbC428­C435. More importantly, the 7 helix is shifted further away from the MIDAS motif in BbC428­C435, as it is locked by a disulfide bridge to stay in that position. The corresponding position of the 7 helix of C2a is 3 Å nearer to the MIDAS motif, because of the position of its N terminus (Figure 3(a) and (b)). It is relevant that BbC428­C435 is missing the portion of the Bb-Ba linker corresponding to the N terminus of C2a, because the cDNA sequence encoding this region had been deleted. Despite the difference in the position of the 7 helix, the torsional angles (Table 3) and positions (Figure 4(b)) of MIDAS motif residues are similar in the BbC428­C435 and C2a structures. The MIDAS motif Buffer solutions used for C2 purification contained 5 mM EDTA and the 2.3 Å resolution structure of the resulting C2a crystals showed weak density at the MIDAS motif equivalent to water molecules with distribution and distance from the coordinating residues identical with the Mg2+ seen in the 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure The difference electron density map from the latter structure revealed clear density (>5) for the bound Mg2+ with octahedral coordination geometry. The average bond length is 2.1 Å, as expected for Mg2+. Residues Asp240, Ser242, Ser244, Thr317 and Asp356 constitute the MIDAS motif of C2a (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The side-chain hydroxyl oxygen atoms of Ser242, Ser244, and Thr317 and three water molecules complete the six coordinating ligands of Mg2+, whereas Asp240 and Asp356 coordinate with Mg2+ through two of the three water molecules observed. The second carboxylate oxygen atom of these Asp240 and Asp356 residues makes hydrogen bonds to Ser242 and Ser244, respectively. Asp240, Ser242, and Ser244 represent the conserved sequence motif DXSXS on the A-1 loop, one of the three loops that surround the MIDAS motif. Mutation of Asp240 or Ser244 to Leu or Ala resulted in almost complete loss of C2 activity.13 Two other loops, 34 and D-5, contribute Thr317 and Asp356, respectively. These MIDAS features of the C2a vWFA domain are identical with those observed in the BbC428­C435 structure,7 and the factor B vWFA domain structure.12 Asp356 of C2a lies within a loop containing a TDG355-357 sequence; the Gly of the corresponding sequence of integrins undergoes a dramatic flip on switching from the closed to the open conformation. 12 As shown in Figure 4(b), the TDG355-357 loop of C2a closely superposes on the corresponding loop of Bb C428­C435 and on that observed in the ligand-bound open conformation of the I domain of the 2 chain (Figure 4(a)). These similarities are reflected in the , torsion angles of the TDG355-357 residues of C2a and the corresponding residues of the other proteins (Table 3).

(b) Stereo diagram showing the superposition of the S1 pocket of C2a (magenta) and Bb (yellow).

hydroxyl oxygen atom of Ser674(195) in factor B is 2.89 Å. In contrast to other typical SPs, where the Lys656(192)-Glu658(194) segment displays interactions with the buried N terminus and with loop D, in C2a it exhibits considerably more contacts with the much extended L2 loop, while such interactions are limited in the BbC428­C435 structure. Interestingly, Arg694 from the L2 loop of C2a forms a salt-bridge with Glu658(194), such that the Arg694 side-chain occupies the space that the charged N-terminal Ile16 occupies in typical active SPs. The Glu658(194)Arg694 salt-bridge seems to be responsible for the stabilization of the L2 loop in C2a, while similar interactions were possible in the factor B SP domain only when the S1 pocket was occupied by the BCX583 inhibitor that is a mimetic of the substrate P1 Arg side-chain.7 However, even in that structure, the oxyanion hole displayed a 310 helix, zymogenlike conformation. The failure of the Glu658(194)Arg694 salt-bridge in C2a and the corresponding Asp673(194)-Arg705 bridge in the Bb C428­C435 BCX583 inhibitor complex to induce the active conformation of the oxyanion hole is puzzling. It suggests that additional structural features present

in typical SPs, but absent from C2 and factor B, are necessary for induction of a functional oxyanion hole. Despite the inactive conformation of the oxyanion hole and the hydrophobic interaction between the catalytic Ser659(195) and Arg671(192), the catalytic triad residues Asp541(102), His487(57), and Ser659(195) of C2a display conventional active site disposition. The S1 pocket of C2a is composed of three polypeptide segments: Ser653(189)-Ser659(195), Ser678(214)-Asn683(218a), and Arg706(225)-His697 (228). Notable differences in C2a from typical SPs with trypsin-like specificity are the substitutions of Ser653(189) and Asp707(226) for the highly conserved Asp189 and Gly226, respectively (Figure 5(b)). A loss of crucial negative charge in the S1 pocket affecting substrate specificity was anticipated in factor B due to the presence of an Asn653(189) instead of Asp189; however, a switch back to Asp from Asn at position 653(189) by sitedirected mutagenesis did not improve the catalytic efficiency and had no effect on specificity. 15 In chymotrypsin, specificity for bulky aromatics is largely determined by Ser189 and the

231 sion of proteolytic activity against C3.3 Concepts about the nature of the conformational change of the vWFA domain have been influenced by studies on the homologous domain of the  chain of integrins, variously termed the I or the A domain, which mediates ligand binding. Mutational and biophysical studies have demonstrated that the I domain can exist in one of two reversible conformations, called closed and open. The open conformation is induced by the ligand, is characterized by high-affinity binding, transduces a signal to neighboring domains of the protein, and can be stabilized in the absence of ligand by the introduction of a disulfide bond. 8­10,17,18 Previous data on factor B, the structural and functional homolog of C2 in the alternative pathway, were only partially consistent with this model. The MIDAS motif of the recombinant vWFA domain of factor B was shown to display a conformation similar to the open one of integrins. This was attributed to the presence of an Asp residue from another domain in the crystal, which completed the coordination of the bound Mg 2+ . 12 Computer modeling indicated the domain can also adopt a closed conformation. Similarly, the vWFA domain in the crystal structure of BbC428­C435 was shown to adopt an open conformation,7 which in this case was attributed to the introduction of a disulfide bond analogous to that locking the open conformation of the integrin I domain.8,9 A major difference from the I domain was that the avidity of BbC428­C435 for C3b was increased only slightly over that of Bb, as opposed to a 100-fold increased affinity for ligand displayed by I domains in the open conformation. The present structure demonstrates clearly that the open conformation of the vWFA domain of C2a is not induced by the cofactor C4b or by any other chance or deliberate contact. Whether it is induced by the cleavage of C2 by C1s or MASP2 or exists in the structure of intact C2 is not clear from the present data. It is clear, however, that in contrast to the I domains, the open conformation is not by itself sufficient for high-avidity binding to C4b. Apparently, transient conformational changes of other regions of the vWFA domain are necessary for binding of C2a to C4b. These changes are reversed when C2a is dissociated from C4b and obviously cannot be induced again. The contribution of the MIDAS motif to C4b binding appears to be mainly through the Mg2+, which probably coordinates to one or more residues of the C4b binding site. A C2-binding site identified on C4b is located at the N-terminal of its ' chain and consists of two acidic sequences, 744EED and 749DEDD.19 Assuming an ionic interaction between this site and the corresponding C2 site, it is perhaps relevant that the region around the MIDAS motif is strongly electronegative, while the main positively charged region is on part of the loop 2 of the SP domain (Figure 2(b)). Electron micrographs of the C4b2a complex11 show C2a attached on C4b through only one of its two domains. Current evidence indicates that this single site is on the vWFA domain and includes the MIDAS motif.13

hydrophobicity of the walls of S1. Despite the presence of Pro654(190), which imparts hydrophobicity to the S1 pocket, and Ser653(189), C2 exhibits trypsin-like specificity for positively charged Arg residues. As we showed earlier for factor B,15 the requirement for negative charge in the S1 pocket of C2a despite the loss of Asp at position 653(189) can apparently be compensated by the Asp residue present at position 707(226), which can effectively hold the P1-Arg and position the scissile bond for cleavage. Asn653 (189) present in the S1 site of factor B was shown to point away from the substratebinding pocket. In contrast, Ser653(189) in C2a points towards the binding pocket and thus contributes to the electro-negativity of the pocket (Figure 5(b)). Domain interface The buried surface area at the interface between the vWFA and SP domains was calculated to be 1890 Å2, compared to 1280 Å2 in BbC428­C435. For this analysis, the linker residues Leu433-Thr439 in the vWFA domain and Gly446-Asp440 in the SP domain and sugar molecules were included. The interface is composed of 39 residues (excepting sugar moieties) from both domains, 12 of which are charged. The residues of the two domains make 30 contacts measuring less than 4 Å, including two salt-bridges and 14 hydrogen bonds. Specifically, the 7 helix of the vWFA domain, which is situated at the domain interface, makes four hydrogen bonds with the 448452 loop segment, and two hydrogen bonds with the sugar molecule at Asn447 of the SP domain. Of note are the interactions between two His residues (His426 and His431) at the C-terminal part of the 7 helix with the SP domain. Specifically, His426 participates in hydrophobic interactions with Phe669 and Met448, while the polar side-chain of His431 and the main chain carbonyl of Glu430 form strong hydrogen bonds with the N-acetylglucosamine residue of Asn447. Probably, these are the interactions that hold the 7 helix in its present shifted position. In the isolated SP domain structure of factor B this segment has no density,6 and, similarly, the 7 helix is not seen in the individual vWFA domain structure,12 which suggests that the above-mentioned interactions are important in the domain interface. Implications for formation of the C3 convertase The present data dictate several changes in the current paradigm of the mechanism of classical/ lectin pathway convertase assembly. It is currently held that initial binding of C2 to C4b is mediated by two low-affinity sites, one on C2b, formed by all three complement control protein modules,16 and the other on the vWFA domain, formed by the MIDAS motif.13 It is further held that cleavage by C1s or MASP2 causes a transient conformational change in the latter site, leading to increased binding avidity for C4b, sequestration of Mg2+ and expres-

232 Therefore, binding of the electropositive patch of the SP domain to the N-terminal electronegative region of the C4b ' chain seems unlikely, which suggests that perhaps the complement control protein modules of C2b bind at that site. The C2a structure also indicates that the active center of the SP domain, like that of Bb, is in an inactive, zymogen-like conformation, a finding consistent with the lack of proteolytic activity. The proposed transduction of an activating signal from the C4b-bound vWFA to the SP domain seems highly unlikely, because of the presence of the Cys443­ Cys561 bond, which would stop transmission of a signal. If that were so, two not mutually exclusive hypotheses can explain the expression of C3-cleaving activity only by C4b-bound C2a. The necessary conformational change of the active center is induced by a direct interaction of the SP domain with the cofactor or with the substrate. As mentioned above, the former interaction could be through the electropositive loop 2 and it seems unlikely. The second possibility, which we favor, has been proposed by us to explain the expression of proteolytic activity by C3b-bound Bb.7 In conclusion, we have presented the crystal structure of C2a, the catalytic fragment of C2. The structure shows the vWFA domain in the open conformation and the catalytic center in the inactive zymogen-like conformation. On the basis of the structure, we propose a new model for the assembly of the C3 convertase of the classical and lectin pathway.

Catalytic Part of Classical Pathway C3 Convertase let containing 2 l of C2 at 20 mg/ml mixed with 2 l of well solution (Hampton crystal screen 2, #380: 1 M Hepes (pH 7.5), 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000) and 0.4 l of 0.3 M glycyl-glycyl-glycine (Hampton additive screen #35) was equilibrated against the reservoir well solution. Long, thick rod-like crystals grew in three to seven days. Data collection C2a native data were collected on a Rigaku R-axis IV imaging-plate detector using CuK radiation from an inhouse Rigaku rotating-anode X-ray generator operating at 100 mA and 50 kV. Ethylene glycol (20%) was used as cryo-protectant and crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100K mounted in litho loops. The cell dimensions and VM calculations showed that space group is P21 and that one molecule is present in the asymmetric unit. The data were processed and scaled using the program D*trek.20 High-resolution 2.0 å diffraction for magnesium soaked C2a crystal was collected on a 3 × 3 mosaic CCD detector at the SBC-CAT 19 BM beamline of the Advance Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. Ethylene glycol (20%) was used as a cryoprotectant before freezing the crystal in liquid nitrogen. The data wwereas processed and scaled using programs DENZO and SCALEPACK.21 The crystallographic data statistics are presented in Table 1. Structure determination, model building, and refinement Initial phases for the C2a data were obtained by the molecule replacement method using the BbC428­C435 structure (1RRK) as a search model with the CNS program.22 A clear solution was obtained in the crossrotation function and subsequent translation function. The location of the SP domain was first obtained and fixed while the location of vWFA domain was searched. The positions of the two domains in the asymmetric unit were subjected to rigid-body refinement, and the resultant orientation between the two domains was very similar to the BbC428­C435 structure. Examination of the electron density map revealed clear density for the core of both the SP and vWFA domains. Chain tracing and model building were carried out with the program COOT.23 Several rounds of model building and final refinement with Refmac,24 and the addition of sugars and water molecules at the final stage gave a final Rcryst of 0.21.7 and an Rfree of 0.28. The C2a native structure was used in refinement of magnesium ion-soaked data. The refinement statistics of C2a and C2a-Mg2+ structure are given in Table 2. The final structure was checked using PROCHECK.25 Protein Data Bank accession code The coordinates of C2a Mg structure and C2a native structure have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession codes 2ODP and 2ODQ, respectively.

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification Full-length C2 cDNA5 was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pACgp67A (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and co-transfected with BD Baculogold Bright linearized baculovirus DNA into sf9 insect cells. A C241A mutation had been introduced into the cDNA to avoid formation of undesired disulfide bonds and protein aggregation. We showed previously that the C241A mutation results in a slight increase of C2 hemolytic activity.13 High-titer stocks were produced and used to infect High Five insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Media from the infection were harvested at day five and C2 was purified by successive chromatography on S Sepharose, Heparin HT, and Mono S using an FLCP system (AKTA Purifier; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Crystallization Crystallization was carried out by the vapor-diffusion method using purified C2 at 20 mg/ml and the hanging drop technique at 22 °C. Initially nine conditions were obtained using various crystallization screen kits with a high-throughput nano technique. Two of them were reproducible, and gave long tree-like crystals that are not suitable for X-ray diffraction. Additives screening was carried out to improve the crystal quality and the following conditions were found most suitable. A drop-
