Apoptotic death sensor: an organelle's alter ego?
Shawn B. Bratton and Gerald M. Cohen
Caspases are intracellular cysteine proteases that are primarily responsible for the stereotypic morphological and biochemical changes that are associated with apoptosis. Caspases are often activated by the apoptotic proteaseactivating factor 1 (APAF-1) apoptosome, a complex that is formed following mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in response to many death-inducing stimuli. Both pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members regulate apoptosis, primarily by their effects on mitochondria, whereas many inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) regulate apoptosis by directly inhibiting distinct caspases. Exposure of cells to chemicals and radiation, as well as loss of trophic stimuli, perturb cellular homeostasis and, depending on the type of cellular stress, particular or multiple organelles appear to `sense' the damage and signal the cell to undergo apoptosis by stimulating the formation of unique and/or common caspase-activating complexes.

Apoptosis is a major form of cell death that is used to remove excess, damaged or infected cells throughout life. It is important in normal cell development, and loss of control of the apoptotic programme contributes to many diseases, including accumulation of unwanted cells through insufficient apoptosis (e.g. cancer) and cell loss as a result of excessive apoptosis (e.g. neurodegeneration, stroke and heart failure)1. Rapid advances over the past few years have identified the key players in the apoptotic programme, which are highly conserved in mammals, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fly Drosophila melanogaster (Table 1). The characteristic changes associated with apoptosis are due to the activation of a family of intracellular cysteine proteases, known as caspases. Activation of caspases is regulated directly or indirectly by anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) families (Table 1). BAX, BAK and BCL-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins are pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family that appear to regulate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the subsequent activation of the apoptosome and caspases, whereas X-linked IAP (XIAP) inhibits the activity of distinct caspases directly. If cell damage induced by noxious stimuli exceeds a certain threshold, different cellular organelles, including mitochondria, the cytoskeleton, the nucleus, the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), sense the damage and signal the cell to undergo apoptosis by engaging the core apoptotic machinery through slight variations of the basic apoptotic programme.
Caspases and IAPs: execution or `stay of execution'?

Regardless of the initial insult and the ensuing upstream death signals generated, the execution

phase of apoptosis normally involves the activation of caspases. These cysteine proteases were first implicated in cell death following the discovery that C. elegans possessed a death gene, ced-3, that was related to the mammalian enzyme, interleukin-1converting enzyme (ICE or caspase-1) (Table 1). Since then, an additional 13 caspases have been identified, primarily by searching databases for genes with sequence similarity. Caspases are synthesized as zymogens or proenzymes that contain a prodomain in addition to one large subunit and one small subunit. Caspases can be subdivided by phylogenetic analysis, substrate specificity or the length of their prodomain. `Initiator' caspases, including caspase-8 and caspase-9, contain long prodomains, which facilitate their interaction with specific `adapter' proteins. Exposure to apoptotic stimuli results in clustering of these adapter proteins, bringing initiator caspases in close proximity to one another to promote trans-catalytic activation. Initiator caspases then activate various short prodomain, `effector caspases', including caspases-3, -6 and -7. This selective cascade is made possible because all caspases recognize specific tetraor pentapeptide motifs (e.g. DEVD, IETD and VDVAD, among others) in their substrates, including other caspases, and cleave almost exclusively after an aspartate residue. Thus, initiator caspases activate effector caspases, which in turn cleave several structural and regulatory proteins. Importantly, cleavage can lead to either a loss in function (e.g. lamins, actin and cytokeratins) or a gain in function (e.g. constitutive activation of protein kinase C  or conversion of BCL-2 or BCL-XL from anti- to proapoptotic proteins). The resulting deregulation of normal cell homeostasis leads to cell death and most of the morphological features that are associated with apoptosis. Although the majority of caspases are localized within the cytoplasm, caspase-2 is present in the nucleus and Golgi apparatus, and caspase-12 is present on the outer ER membrane. In addition, caspases-9, -3 and -2 are present in small quantities within the mitochondria. Therefore, selective localization of specific caspases in particular organelles within the cell might facilitate potential organelle-specific caspase activation2,3. Caspases are inhibited by some viral and mammalian proteins, including IAPs. First identified in baculoviruses, these evolutionarily conserved proteins contain tandem repeats of ~70 amino acids, termed baculovirus IAP repeats

(BIR domains), and many also contain a C-terminal RING zinc-finger domain4. Several homologs that contain one or both domains have been identified in mammalian cells, including XIAP (hILP), ML-IAP (Livin or KIAP), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 [cIAP-1 (HIAP-2)], cIAP-2 (HIAP-1), neuronal apoptotic inhibitory protein (NAIP) and survivin (Table 1). The anti-apoptotic mechanisms of some of these proteins are unclear; however, XIAP, ML-IAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 reportedly inhibit apoptosis through direct inhibition of caspases5. In particular, XIAP inhibits the activities of caspases-3, -7 and -9 in vitro, but not that of caspase-8. Remarkably, XIAP inhibits active caspases-3 and -9 through distinct domains. The BIR-2 domain of XIAP, together with a few crucial adjacent residues, inhibits caspase-3, whereas the BIR-3 domain of XIAP inhibits caspase-9 (Refs 6,7). Because many RING zinc-finger domains possess E3 ligase activity,

some IAPs are capable of ubiquitinating and targeting either their caspase substrates or themselves for proteasome-mediated degradation8,9. Thus, in addition to inhibiting specific caspases, certain IAPs might also mediate the removal of caspases from the cell. The importance of IAPs in regulating caspase activity appears significant because several proteins have been identified that promote caspase activation by blocking IAP function. In Drosophila, reaper (rpr), head involution defective (hid ) and grim are transcriptionally upregulated in response to numerous death stimuli, and their gene products promote caspase activation by inhibiting Drosophila IAP-1 (DIAP-1)10. In mammalian cells, SMAC [second mitochondrial activator of caspases (also known as DIABLO)] is processed and sequestered within mitochondria. However, during severe cellular stress, SMAC is released into the cytoplasm, where it displaces XIAP from processed

Box 1. The regulation of cytochrome c release from mitochondria
BCL-2 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family members modulate mitochondrial cytochrome c release, formation of the apoptosome or activation of caspases. At least three separate mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the release of cytochrome c: (1) the permeability transition (PT) pore; (2) the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC); or (3) various channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (Fig. I). PT pore In some apoptotic models, a loss in the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (m) (i.e. the difference in the charge across the inner mitochondrial membrane) occurs when the mitochondrial PT pore is activated. This pore is formed from a complex of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), VDAC (also termed porin) and cyclophilin D. ANT, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and VDAC, located in the OMM, act in concert to form the PT pore, which is relatively nonselective and allows the passage of small molecules or proteins (<1.5 kDa). When the pore opens, there is a loss in the normal proton gradient (hypopolarization) across the IMM. This results in an influx of fluid into the matrix, which causes swelling and rupturing of the OMM because the surface area of the OMM is less than that of the convoluted, cristae-containing IMM. Disruption of the OMM results in the release of pro-apoptotic proteins, including cytochrome c [Cyt c (red spheres in Fig. I)], SMAC [second mitochondrial activator of caspases (DIABLO)] and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), from the intermembrane space into the cytosol. In support of this hypothesis, inhibitors of the PT pore, including cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid, which bind and inhibit cyclophilin D and ANT, respectively, inhibit cell death in some models of apoptosis. BCL-2 and BCL-XL are reported to inhibit the opening of VDAC, whereas BAX and BAK promote opening of this channel. Importantly, however, several reports indicate that cytochrome c release occurs before a loss in m and that, in fact, caspases induce opening of the PT pore, which suggests that a change in m is a relatively late apoptotic event that might form part of an amplification loopa. Disruption of mitochondrial metabolism The hypothesis that disruption of mitochondrial metabolism can regulate cytochrome c release is based on the suggestion that mitochondrial metabolism is altered during apoptosis. Normally, VDAC and ANT coordinately shuttle ADP into the matrix from the cytosol in exchange for ATP Following physiological withdrawal . of growth factors (GFs), however, VDAC takes on a closed conformation, limiting the uptake of complex anions across the OMM. Because ANT continues to transfer ATP and ADP across the IMM, normal m is maintained until all of the available ADP in the matrix has been consumed. It is proposed that if the electron transport chain continues to operate in the absence of ADP it might lead to an increase in m or `hyperpolarization' , and enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. Both these factors might stress the IMM and lead to an increase in the influx of water into the matrix, followed by swelling and rupture of the OMM. In contrast to the PT pore hypothesis, in this model BCL-2 and/or BCL-XL are proposed to maintain VDAC in an open conformation to facilitate ATP and ADP exchange across the OMM, and thus inhibit mitochondrial hyperpolarization, cytochrome c release and apoptosisb. Pro-apoptotic BCL-2 pore More recently, pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members BAX or BAK have been proposed to form high molecular weight, oligomeric pores in membranes through which cytochrome c can pass. In some cases, these pores might involve VDAC, and their formation might be stimulated by changes in the pH (acidification) or by BCL-2 homology domain-3 (BH3)-only proteins, such as truncated BID (tBID). In addition, BCL-2 and BCL-XL appear to inhibit formation of these pores in lipid membranes, although the inhibition is probably not direct

caspases-9, -3 and -7 and promotes caspase activity11­13. Interestingly, RPR, HID, Grim and SMAC exhibit almost no sequence homology, except at their immediate N-termini (Table 1). In SMAC, an AVPI motif is crucial for its ability to interact with the BIR-3 domain in XIAP, where it competes with active caspase-9 for binding13. Several IAPs, including survivin and NAIP, do not directly inhibit active caspases in vitro but are antiapoptotic. Survivin is expressed primarily during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, where it localizes to the mitotic apparatus and plays an important role in cytokinesis. However, survivin associates with caspase-3 and the cyclin-dependent-kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Waf1 or Cip1 within centromeres, and disruption of this complex results in caspase activation and cleavage of p21. In addition, survivin also associates with and is phosphorylated by p34cdc2-cyclin B1, and loss of phosphorylation disrupts survivin­caspase-9 complexes, which results in caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. Thus, although
http://tips.trends.com

survivin does not directly inhibit caspases, it does control their activation in certain contexts14,15. Even XIAP and cIAPs appear to be multifunctional proteins because they are implicated in transforming growth factor  (TGF-)- and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-)-mediated signaling cascades16.
Mitochondria: gateways to the apoptosome

Early morphological studies on apoptosis suggested that although major changes, including nuclear condensation, plasma membrane blebbing, ER dilation and cytoskeletal reorganization, took place in the cell, few noticeable changes were apparent in the mitochondria. This was in stark contrast to necrosis, a process that is associated with the frequent swelling and rupture of mitochondria during cell death17. Consequently, mitochondria were not initially considered to be involved in the apoptotic process. However, Xiaodong Wang and colleagues later identified three cellular factors required for activation of caspase-3. These factors were

mitochondrial swelling and rupture of the OMM are not requiredc. However, if this was a common mechanism for cytochrome c release, one might expect that either BAX or BAK would be involved in most forms of apoptosis involving the mitochondria. Indeed, Bax-/- Bak-/- mice show dramatic developmental abnormalities, including persistence of interdigital webs, failure to develop vaginal introitis, brain and neurological defects, and increased myeloid cells and lymphocytes, with massive accumulation of the latter in spleen and lymph nodes. Thymocytes isolated from these animals were also resistant to -irradiation and etoposided. Formation of the apoptosome Once released, cytochrome c initiates formation of the apoptosome, which in turn sequentially activates caspases-9, -3 and -7. Caspase activation leads to the cleavage of cellular substrates and apoptosis. The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) can inhibit the activity of caspase-9 and prevent it from activating caspases-3 and -7, as well as directly inhibiting these caspases. By contrast, SMAC (DIABLO) promotes caspase activation by binding to and inhibiting XIAP BIM and BMF . interact with cytoplasminc dynein light chains (LC8) in the dynein motor complex. Following stress, BIM­LC8 or BMF­LC8 complexes are released from the dynein motor complex, where they inhibit anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins and thus induce release of cytochrome c.

because mutants of BCL-2 and BCL-XL that do not interact with BAX are nonetheless anti-apoptotic. Such a `pore' hypothesis for cytochrome c release appears to be a favorable one, in that

cytochrome c, caspase-9 and a new protein they termed apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1). APAF-1 was immediately recognized as a mammalian homolog of CED-4, a C. elegans protein required for the activation of CED-3 (Table 1). However, APAF-1 appeared more evolutionarily advanced because, in addition to a CED-4 domain, it also contained an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and a C-terminal WD-40 repeat domain (WDR)18. In a mechanism that is not clearly understood, cytochrome c appears to interact with the WDR in APAF-1, whereas dATP or ATP binds the nucleotide binding domain located within the CED-4 domain. Cytochrome c and dATP or ATP, acting in concert, induce a conformational change in APAF-1 that allows it to undergo self-oligomerization via its CED-4 domain into at least two large (~1.4 MDa and ~700 kDa) caspase-activating complexes or `apoptosomes' (Refs 19­22) (Box 1). Procaspase-9 is simultaneously recruited to the newly exposed

N-terminal CARD of APAF-1, where it undergoes trans-catalytic activation. Active caspase-9 then recruits and activates effector caspases-3 and -7 within the apoptosome19,23. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the ~700 kDa complex is present in a different conformation and exhibits significantly greater activity than the ~1.4 MDa complex20,24. The caspase inhibitor XIAP also associates with the apoptosome, where it inhibits the activity of processed caspase-9 but, perhaps more importantly, is perfectly situated to inhibit effector caspases-3 and -7 following their activation and might prevent their release from the apoptosome23. Because the release of cytochrome c is such a crucial step in the formation of apoptosome complexes, the cell must tightly regulate its release from mitochondria. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL, inhibit formation of the apoptosome by blocking the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria during cellular stress. Importantly, the C. elegans anti-apopotic BCL-2

homolog CED-9 prevents CED-3 activation by directly inhibiting CED-4. However, this function is not conserved in mammals because BCL-2 proteins do not interact with APAF-1 at endogenous concentrations25. Pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, such as BAX, BAK and truncated BID (tBID), promote cell death by stimulating cytochrome c release. Because many BCL-2 proteins dimerize with themselves or with other BCL-2 family members, it has been suggested that anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members might inhibit the function of proapoptotic members (or vice versa) through direct interaction. Indeed, in the worm, the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 protein EGL-1 promotes CED-4 activation by inhibiting CED-9 (Table 1). However, several BCL-2 family members, both pro- or anti-apoptotic, also share pore-forming domains that are similar in structure to those observed in diphtheria toxin and colicins, and some are anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane by their hydrophobic C-termini, where they are believed to form ion channels (particularly at low pH). Therefore, the specific mechanism(s) that mediate cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and the roles of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in this process are not well understood and remain highly contentious. There are currently at least three hypotheses proposed to explain the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and its modulation by BCL-2 family members (Box 1).
Cytoskeletal networks: apoptotic `trip-wires'?

(D.C. Huang and A. Strasser, pers. commun.). Thus, both BIM and BMF inhibit the function of antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins, allowing BAX-like proteins to promote apoptosis unchallenged. In fact, BIM and BMF might represent a more general paradigm in which cellular damage is sensed by a specific BH3-only protein in a particular tissue28.
The nucleus: DNA damage and p53-dependent apoptosis

In normal cells BIM, a BH3-only containing protein (Table 1), is primarily bound to the microtubuleassociated dynein motor complex, through an association with the LC8 cytoplasmic dynein light chain. BIM plays a crucial role in sensing apoptotic signals that impinge on the cytoskeleton and motor complexes. Certain apoptotic stimuli, such as taxol, an anti-cancer agent that perturbs microtubules, induce the release of a complex of BIM and LC8 from the dynein motor complex. The BIM­LC8 complex then relocalizes to the membranes of intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria, where it binds to and inhibits the function of BCL-2 or functional homologs26 (Box 1). Interestingly, lymphocytes from BIM-deficient mice are resistant to taxol, cytokine deprivation and Ca2+ ion fluxes, but not to other stimuli, including CD95 ligand and etoposide27. Therefore, apoptotic signals, in addition to those resulting from perturbation of microtubules, might be integrated through BIM. Thus, the pro-apoptotic activity of BIM is controlled, at least in part, through its sequestration to microtubules, where it is unavailable to interact with and inhibit antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Similarly, another BH3only protein, termed BMF, appears to associate primarily with actin fibers in naïve cells but relocalizes to intracellular membranes following particular apoptotic stimuli, where it also inhibits the function of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins

DNA damage, induced by irradiation, drugs or environmental toxicants, frequently induces cell death by apoptosis17. However, cells differ enormously in their response to DNA damage, depending in part on cell type, cell-cycle status and differentiation state. The mechanisms involved in this response are complex and involve initial recognition and assessment of the damage, followed by an appropriate response that involves either DNA repair or cell death. One key sensor of DNA damage is the nuclear protein p53. This transcription factor and tumor suppressor integrates numerous signals that are crucial to the control of life and death of the cell. p53 is activated, in part, by various signals that induce its dissociation from its inhibitor, MDM2 (mouse double minute 2). Indeed, p53 is phosphorylated by various kinases in response to DNA-damaging stimuli, and c-MYC, another transcription factor, activates p53 by upregulation of p14ARF, an inhibitor of MDM2 (Fig. 1). Once activated, p53 binds to specific sequences in DNA and initiates the transcription of many genes involved in genetic stability, cell-cycle inhibition and apoptosis29. p53 induces or maintains growth arrest through increased expression of cell-cycle regulators, such as p21Waf1 or Cip1, an inhibitor of CDKs, or 14-3-3, which sequesters cyclin-B1­CDK1 complexes outside the nucleus. In some cells, p53 appears to induce apoptosis through upregulation of specific proapoptotic genes, such as CD95 (also known as FAS or APO-1), DR5 (also known as TRAIL-R2, TRICK2 or KILLER) and BAX 30­32 (Fig. 1). The significance of some of these results, however, is unclear because DNA-damage-induced apoptosis occurs normally in some cells from gld mice, which contain an inactive CD95 receptor, and in some Fas-associated death domain (FADD)- and caspase-8-deficient cells, which are defective in CD95-, TNF-- and DR5-mediated cell death signaling33,34. In addition, although both p53 and BAX are required for some forms of DNAdamage-induced apoptosis, particularly in neurons, it remains unclear whether p53 induces apoptosis specifically through transcriptional upregulation of BAX 35,36. Interestingly, the p53-binding sites present in the human BAX gene are absent in murine Bax, indicating that p53-dependent upregulation of BAX is not an evolutionarily conserved pathway. NOXA, P53AIP1 and PIDD, a new death domain-containing protein, have recently been implicated as candidates for mediation of p53-induced apoptosis37­39. NOXA is

a pro-apoptotic BH3-only containing protein, which, on overexpression, localizes to mitochondria and interacts with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, which results in activation of caspase-9 (Ref. 37). APAF-1 and caspase-9 are essential downstream effectors of p53-mediated apoptosis. Indeed, disruption of either the gene encoding APAF-1 or that encoding caspase-9 in fibroblasts prevents c-MYCinduced cell death without affecting p53 accumulation or activation. Moreover, APAF1-/- and caspase-9 -/- cells, like p53-/- cells, are readily transformed by c-MYC and RAS, implying that APAF-1 and caspase-9 might also act as tumor suppressors40. Consistent with the idea that apoptosome formation is required for c-MYC- and p53-induced apoptosis, c-MYC sensitizes cells to a wide range of apoptotic stimuli, including serum depletion, hypoxia and DNA-damaging agents, by facilitating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. How c-MYC and p53 sensitize mitochondria is unclear but might involve some of the mechanisms described above, in addition to others. Indeed, a recent study suggests that p53 relocalizes to mitochondria during p53-dependent apoptosis, preceding changes in mitochondrial membrane

Fig. 1. p53 is activated in response to nuclear damage and induces apoptosis through upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. The `activity' of p53 is regulated, in part, by its expression in the cell. The half-life of p53 in unstressed cells is very short as a result of its interaction with MDM2 (mouse double minute 2), an E3-ligase that ubiquitinates p53 at its C-terminus and targets it for rapid degradation by the proteasome. Consequently, p53 is `activated' by inhibiting its association with MDM2, thereby stabilizing its presence within the cell. There are at least three different signals or pathways that lead to activation of p53, each of which destabilizes the interaction of p53 with MDM2. Following DNA damage (e.g. double-stranded breaks induced by ionizing radiation), several kinases appear to `sense' the damage, including DNA-dependent protein kinase, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), CHK1 and CHK2. Each of these kinases phosphorylates p53 at its N-terminus or `transactivation domain' and inhibits its interaction with MDM2. Similarly, a large number of chemotherapeutic agents, ultraviolet light and protein kinase inhibitors appear to activate another set of kinases, namely ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-related) and casein kinase II, which phosphorylate p53 in its activation domain and C-terminal regulatory domain, respectively. Aberrant growth signals resulting from expression of oncogenes, such as MYC, RAS or E1A, might also increase the expression of p53. In the case of E1A, this viral retinoblastoma (Rb)-binding protein upregulates the expression of p14ARF by activating E2F1-dependent transcription. p14ARF is a nucleolar protein that directly inhibits MDM2 and sequesters it away from p53, which resides elsewhere in the nucleus. Thus, p14ARF indirectly increases p53 expression by inhibiting the function of MDM2 (Refs 29,63). Following activation, p53 might transcriptionally upregulate the expression of certain pro-apoptotic genes, including CD95, CD95L, DR5, BAX and NOXA, or it might directly target mitochondria, initiating cytochrome c release through an unknown mechanism. Upregulation of `death receptors' such as CD95 and DR5 [members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of receptors] by p53 can lead to activation of caspases. These receptors contain cysteine-rich extracellular domains that interact with their respective ligands, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular cytoplasmic death domain (DD). These various domains function together to transduce a death signal from the outer surface of the cell membrane to the intracellular apoptotic machinery43,44. CD95 ligand (CD95L) and TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) interact with and induce conformational changes in CD95 and DR5 receptors, respectively, resulting in clustering of the receptor's cytosolic DD and recruitment of the adapter protein FADD [Fas-associated death domain (also termed MORT1)]. FADD contains both a C-terminal DD and an N-terminal death effector domain (DED), which allows it to interact simultaneously with the receptor's cytoplasmic DD and DEDs located in the prodomain of caspase-8. As in the `induced proximity model'45, which might be common to all caspase-activating complexes, apical procaspase-8 is believed to cluster within this death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and undergo trans-catalytic activation. Active caspase-8 then processes and activates effector caspases, which are responsible for dismantling the cell. Abbreviation: tBID, truncated BID.

potential and cytochrome c release, and direct targeting of p53 to mitochondria induces apoptosis in p53-deficient cells41. p53 also appears to regulate the transport of CD95 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane42. Therefore, the possibility exists that p53 might also induce apoptosis through transcriptionally independent mechanisms.
Plasma membrane: receptors that kill

As described above, activation of p53 might, in some cases, upregulate the expression of CD95 and DR5. Often referred to as `death receptors', CD95 and DR5 are members of the TNF superfamily of receptors, which also include TNFR1, TNFR2, DR3 (also known as WSL-1R or TRAMP), DR4 (also known as TRAIL-R1) and DR6. These receptors all possess cysteine-rich extracellular domains, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic sequence known as the death domain (DD)43. Interestingly, after inserting

apoptosis in an autocrine or paracrine fashion by upregulating the expression of either the death receptor and/or its ligand, although this still remains to be proven in the majority of examples. However, one exception is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), whose active metabolite inhibits thymidylate synthase and causes thymine depletion. This results in a p53-dependent increase in CD95L expression and ultimately in apoptosis. Thus, 5-FU toxicity does appear to involve CD95 signaling48. Although controversial, toxicants might also indirectly induce the formation of APAF-1­ caspase-9 apoptosome complexes, downstream of deathreceptor-initiated events. In this pathway, death receptors initially activate caspase-8, which in turn cleaves and activates BID. Truncated BID can then stimulate cytochrome c release from mitochondria and induce formation of APAF-1­caspase-9 apoptosome complexes (Fig. 1 and Box 1). Thus, a caspase amplification loop might be established, whereby both caspase-8 and caspase-9 can contribute to the activation of effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 (Ref. 49).

ER stress
TRENDS in Pharmacological Sciences

Fig. 2. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to formation of inositol-requiring (IRE)­TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptorassociated factor 2) complexes that activate c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways and caspase-12. ER stress activates IRE1, which in turn recruits TRAF2 to the ER membrane. TRAF2 initiates a JNK signaling pathway, involving apoptotic signaling kinase 1 (ASK-1), mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) or MKK7, and JNK, which results in the phosphorylation and inactivation of BCL-XL. TRAF2 might also recruit and induce transactivation of procaspase12. In addition, Ca2+ activates m-calpain, leading to activation of caspase-12 or might stimulate cytochrome c (red spheres) release from mitochondria, resulting in formation of the apoptosome.

into the plasma membrane, these receptors appear to trimerize naturally through interactions involving extracellular pre-ligand-binding assembly domains (PLADs)44. Binding of pre-trimerized death receptors with their cognate ligands results in receptor activation and recruitment of adapter proteins to the DDs. For example, CD95 ligand (CD95L) interacts with and induces trimerization of CD95 receptors, which results in clustering of the cytosolic DD of the receptor and recruitment of the adapter molecule FADD (also termed MORT1). FADD, which contains a C-terminal DD, binds trimerized CD95 receptors through DD­DD interactions. However, FADD also contains an N-terminal death effector domain (DED), which allows it to associate simultaneously with similar DEDs located in the prodomain of caspase-8. This complex of proteins is referred to as the deathinducing signaling complex (DISC), and as more procaspase-8 molecules are recruited to this complex, they cluster and undergo trans-catalysis to generate active caspase-8, which in turn activates the effector caspase-3 (Refs 43,45) (Fig. 1). Many anti-cancer agents, including etoposide, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin and bleomycin, are reported to induce apoptosis by inducing the synthesis of CD95L, which binds to CD95 and activates the death receptor pathway. The increase in CD95L mRNA appears to involve the activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor B (NF-B) and activator protein 1 (AP-1)46. However, the relevance of these findings to drug-induced cytotoxicity has been questioned because although increases in CD95L protein have been observed, high drug concentrations were required47. Thus, some toxicants might induce

The ER plays a key role in folding, modifying and sorting newly synthesized proteins, maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and synthesizing lipids and sterols. When these processes are disturbed, at least three major ER stress-induced signaling pathways can be activated: (1) the unfolded protein response (UPR), which leads to induction of ER-localized proteins, including chaperones such as BiP (GRP78), GRP94 and calreticulin, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and the transcription factor, CHOP (GADD153); (2) the ER-overload response (EOR) pathway, which leads to activation of NF-B and, consequently, production of interferons and cytokines; and (3) phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF-2), which inhibits initiation of translation and, thus, blocks protein synthesis. Each of these pathways enables the cell to deal with accumulated or incorrectly folded proteins in the ER. However, when the ER stress is too great, the cell might die via apoptosis through mechanisms that are currently unclear50,51 (Fig. 2). In yeast, the UPR is initiated by inositol-requiring (IRE)1. This ER-associated type I transmembrane protein contains both kinase and endoribonuclease domains, which are required to splice out a translational attenuator in HAC-1 mRNA and allow for efficient translation of this important transcription factor. HAC-1 then initiates transcription of a variety of genes required for the UPR in yeast. Mammalian ER also contains two IRE1 ( and ) homologs, but no mammalian HAC-1 homolog has yet been identified. Nevertheless, overexpression of human or murine IRE1 constitutively activates the UPR, transcriptionally

Box 2. BAP31 as ER-specific caspase-activating complex
Another endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-specific apoptotic signaling complex, comprising BAP31, a putative CED-4 adapter protein, procaspase-8L, and BCL-XL or BCL-2, has been reported (Fig. I). BAP31 was first implicated in apoptosis when it was found to interact with BCL-2 in adenoviral-infected apoptotic cells expressing E1A (Ref. a). BAP31, a polytopic integral ER membrane protein, was thought primarily to mediate export of certain proteins, such as IgD and cellubrevin, from the ER. However, Shore and colleagues identified a cytosolic C-terminal domain with weak homology to death effector domains (DEDs) that was flanked by two identical caspase-8 cleavage sites (AAVDG)a. BAP31 interacted with BCL-2 or BCL-XL and procaspase-8 when overexpressed in 293 cells; however, procaspase-8 did not interact with BAP31 in vitro, which suggests that the interaction was indirect. Because CED-4 reportedly bridges BCL-XL with caspase-8 when expressed in mammalian cells, a similar approach was taken with BAP31. Indeed, CED-4 bound BAP31 through its DED-like domain and enhanced the interaction of BAP31 with BCL-XL and procaspase-8 (Ref. b). Consequently, it was proposed that a human CED-4 homolog might be required for efficient formation of this ER-specific complex in cells. Unfortunately, it was unclear if this complex could participate in the direct processing and activation of caspase-8. Nevertheless, active caspase-8 could cleave BAP31 to an ~20-kDa N-terminal fragment, which remained integrated into the ER membrane, and when overexpressed in naive cells, potently induced apoptosisa. Interestingly, overexpression of a noncleavable mutant of BAP31 (crBAP31) in cells inhibited Fas-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria, as well as membrane blebbing, actin reorganization and formation of apoptotic bodies. In addition, crBAP31 promoted the long-term survival of Fas-treated cells but, paradoxically, did not

appear to inhibit caspase activation, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), phosphatidylserine externalization or DNA fragmentation significantlyc. Thus, the BAP31 complex might facilitate crosstalk between the ER, mitochondria and cytoplasm during certain forms of apoptosis.

upregulates CHOP and induces apoptosis52. Although not normally expressed in cells, CHOP is potently induced by chemicals, including tunicamycin, thapsigargin, Ca2+ ionophores and dithiothreitol (DTT), that perturb protein folding and cause accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Overexpression of CHOP can in some circumstances induce apoptosis but, more convincingly, Chop­/­ mice and cells derived from these mice exhibit less apoptosis in response to ER stress than their wildtype counterparts53. Thus, increased expression of CHOP or CHOP-regulated genes might play an important role in ER-stress-induced apoptosis. ER stress can also lead to the release of Ca2+ from the ER and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Each of these signals appears to mediate EORinduced NF-B activation50. Although activation of NF-B could promote apoptosis, in most model systems its activation results in upregulation of proteins that inhibit apoptosis. Alternatively, Ca2+ and ROS could play a direct role in altering mitochondrial function. For example, high cytosolic Ca2+ can induce a loss in the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (m), which results in the release of cytochrome c and formation of the apoptosome, as previously described. Ca2+ might also

promote the direct association of mitochondria with smooth subdomains of the ER, which could facilitate the movement of pro-apoptotic signals or proteins from stressed ER to mitochondria. ER stress or other apoptotic stimuli might also activate caspases at the ER surface and induce apoptosis (Fig. 2 and Box 2). Murine caspase-12, a member of the ICE subfamily of caspases with high homology to caspase-1 (39% identity), is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues and resides predominantly on the outer ER membrane. Caspase12 is activated by chemicals that induce ER stress [e.g. thapsigargin, calcimycin (A23187), brefeldin A or tunicamycin] but not by agents that engage the mitochondrial pathway (e.g. serum deprivation or staurosporine) or by death receptors. Caspase-12 might also play a role in ER stress-induced apoptosis in renal tubular epithelium and in amyloid- neurotoxicity, which implicates the human ortholog of caspase-12 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease54. The precise mechanism(s) responsible for activation of caspase-12 is currently unclear, although m-calpain has been implicated55. Because caspase-12 contains a long prodomain, it is presumed to be an `initiator caspase' and to associate with an adapter protein located in the ER membrane. In this

regard, TNF-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adapter protein that associates with TNF receptor complexes and induces activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), is similarly recruited to the ER membrane following ER stress, where it interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of IRE1 (Ref. 56) (Fig. 2). Recent work suggests that TRAF2 plays a direct role in the activation of caspase-12 through an induced proximity model57, similar to that proposed for FADD and APAF-1-mediated activation of caspases-8 and -9, respectively45. Once activated, caspase-12 probably activates effector caspases to induce apoptosis. Of note, active caspase-7 also appears to localize to the ER during apoptosis58, which raises the possibility that it might be a preferred substrate of caspase-12. In any event, IRE1­TRAF2 complexes are also capable of activating JNKs, and JNK activity appears to be fundamentally important for ER-stress-induced apoptosis. Indeed, TRAF2 activates apoptotic signaling kinase 1 (ASK-1) and consequently JNKs, following both TNF receptor stimulation and ER stress, and MEF cells isolated from Ask-1-/- mice are resistant to both TNF- and polyglutamine aggregation59,60 (H. Nishitoh and H. Ichijo, pers.

commun.). In both instances, ASK-1-deficient cells are unable to sustain prolonged activation of JNK and p38 kinases and are resistant to apoptosis. Consistent with these findings, Jnk-1-/-Jnk-2 -/- MEF cells are also resistant to ER stress61. Interestingly, JNK redistributes from the cytosol to the mitochondria during apoptosis. Therefore, the possibility exists that JNKs might modulate the release of cytochrome c via phosphorylation of a specific mitochondrial protein, such as BCL-XL (Ref. 62).
Concluding remarks

Drug- or toxicant-induced apoptotic pathways are complicated, particularly in terms of how injury to the cell is translated into an apoptotic signal. Indeed, the initial signals that induce apoptosis are largely unclear and will undoubtedly be the focus of much future research. The execution of apoptosis often involves mitochondrial perturbation, release of cytochrome c, formation of the apoptosome and activation of caspases. However, each organelle within the cell appears to detect and respond to apoptotic stimuli in unique ways, either re-routing the signal directly through the mitochondria or in some cases, directly activating its own death pathway.
