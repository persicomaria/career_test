Structure of 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7phosphate Synthase from Escherichia coli: Comparison of the Mn2*2-Phosphoglycolate and the Pb2*2-Phosphoenolpyruvate Complexes and Implications for Catalysis
Trixie Wagner, Igor A. Shumilin, Ronald Bauerle and Robert H. Kretsinger*
Department of Biology University of Virginia Charlottesville VA 22903-2477, USA The crystal structure of the phenylalanine-regulated 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) from Escherichia coli in complex with Mn2 and the substrate analog, 2-phosphoglycolate (PGL), was determined by molecular replacement using X-ray diffracÊ tion data to 2.0 A resolution. DAHPS*Mn*PGL crystallizes in space Ê Ê Ê group C2 (a  210.4 A, b  53.2 A, c  149.4 A, b  116.1  ) with its four (b/a)8 barrel subunits related by non-crystallographic 222 symmetry. The re®nement was carried out without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints and yielded agreement factors of R  20.9 % and Rfree  23.9 %. Mn2, the most ef®cient metal activator, is coordinated by the same four side-chains (Cys61, His268, Glu302 and Asp326) as is the poorly activating Pb2. A ®fth ligand is a well-de®ned water molecule, which is within hydrogen bonding distance to an essential lysine residue (Lys97). The distorted octahedral coordination sphere of the metal is completed by PGL, which replaces the substrate, 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), in the active site. However, unlike PEP in the Pb*PEP complex, PGL binds the Mn2 via one of its carboxylate oxygen atoms. A model of the active site is discussed in which PEP binds in the same orientation as does PGL in the DAHPS*Mn*PGL structure and the phosphate of E4P is tethered at the site of a bound sulfate anion. The re face of E4P can be positioned to interact with the si face of PEP with only small movement of the protein.

biosynthesis of aromatic compounds in plants and microorganisms. It catalyzes the aldol-like, stereospeci®c condensation of 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) (Figure 1). DAHP is then converted by the subsequent enzymes of the pathway to chorismate, the common branch point precursor for the three aromatic amino acid residues and most other aromatic end products (reviewed by Hermann, 1995). In Escherichia coli there are three DAHPS isoforms, one speci®cally feedback-inhibited by L-phenylalanine, one by L-tryptophan, and one by L-tyrosine. All three isozymes require a divalent cation for activity (Stephens & Bauerle,

2-phosphoglycolate (PGL), shown in Figure 1. We report here the results of our crystal structure Ê determination to 2.0 A resolution. Based on an analysis of packing, we propose an explanation for the lack of isomorphism observed in several of our DAHPS derivatives. The higher-level resolution of the data allowed us to detect some differences in the protein main-chain relative to DAHPS*Pb*PEP, to trace one of the formerly unde®ned loops, and to inspect the active site for solvent sites that might be involved in the catalytic reaction. Assuming that PEP has an orientation similar to that of PGL and that the phosphate group of E4P is tethered to the site of a bound sulfate anion, we found that E4P can be oriented so that the si face of PEP is in proper position to attack the re face of E4P, in accordance with the established stereochemisty (Floss et al., 1972).

Results and Discussion
Structure solution and model quality The structure of DAHPS*Mn*PGL was solved by molecular replacement using subunit C of the DAHPS*Pb*PEP complex (Shumilin et al., 1999) as the search model. The rotation function search yielded straightforward solutions for all four subunits, the correlation coef®cients of which, however, differ considerably (Table 1). In the initial electron density maps, areas corresponding to active site residues, ligands, and loop region 313317 in subunit B, not contained in the search model are clearly visible. The re®nement resulted in a model with good overall stereochemistry and agreement factors (Table 2). Overall structure The overall structure of DAHPS*Mn*PGL is very similar to that of DAHPS*Pb*PEP (Shumilin et al., 1999). DAHPS*Mn*PGL is a tetramer of four identical subunits related by non-crystallographic 222 symmetry (Figure 2(a)). Each subunit consists of a (b/a)8 barrel enhanced by several additional secondary structure elements, including an N-terminal tail that forms a three-stranded, anti-parallel bsheet with the b6a/b6b strands of an adjacent subunit (Figure 3). These two subunit pairs (A and B and C and D, respectively, see Figure 2(a)) form Ê tight dimers with a buried surface area of 2600 A2 per subunit. The intersubunit contacts at this interface consist of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges

1991). A number of divalent metal ions activate DAHPS in vitro with ef®ciencies varying over a 20-fold range as follows: Mn2 > Fe2 % Cd2 > Co2 > Cu2 % Ni2 % Zn2 4Ca2 > Pb2. The activating metal in vivo appears to be Fe2 (Stephens & Bauerle, 1991; Ray & Bauerle, 1991). The crystal structure of the phenylalanine-regulated DAHPS isozyme complexed with PEP and Pb2 (DAHPS(Phe)*Pb*PEP) was recently determined by MAD phasing from the Pb2 by our group (Shumilin et al., 1999). It is a homotetramer consisting of four (b/a)8 barrel subunits related by non-crystallographic 222 symmetry. Both the metal and PEP are bound at the active site of the enzyme at the C-terminal end of the barrel. The coordination of PEP and Pb2 involves the interaction between the 6 s2 lone pair of electrons of the lead and the conjugated p system of PEP (ShimoniLivny et al., 1998). One of the goals here is to determine whether the role of the metal ion required by the enzyme is structural or catalytic in nature. For this purpose we have crystallized DAHPS(Phe) in complex with Mn2, the most active metal in kinetic experiments, and with the non-reacting substrate analog,

391 replacement is correspondingly higher (Table 1). Therefore, our description of the subunit will use values obtained from B. The tetramers of DAHPS*Mn*PGL and of DAHPS*Pb*PEP observe 222 symmetry within 0.2  and can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of only Ê 0.47 A for all main-chain atoms, indicating that the orientation of subunits relative to each other is a constant feature of the enzyme and is relatively independent of the metal or ligand bound at the active site. Scaling of the data sets, however, results in overall w2 values > 70, indicating a considerable degree of non-isomorphism between the two structures. To explore this phenomenon we compared DAHPS*Mn*PGL and DAHPS*Pb*PEP with respect to the centers and orientations of their 222 non-crystallographic symmetry operators relative to the a, b, c* reference system. While the orientation of the three axes is maintained, the tetramer in the DAHPS*Mn*PGL structure is shifted parallel to the crystallographic ac plane in the Àa and c direction (Figure 2(b)). This movement, which brings molecule 1 in Figure 2(b) in closer proximity to the two symmetry related molecules 4 and À4, correlates with an elongation of the crystallographic b-axis. This in turn accounts for the poor scaling of the diffraction data. Subunit structure

In contrast, the interface between subÊ units A and C (B and D) buries only 500 A2 of accessible surface area, with interactions mainly through the side-chains of Glu24, Lys 25, Arg124, and His217. Subunits A and D (B and C) interact only at the origin of the three non-crystallographic 2-fold axes by the stacking of the imidazole rings of His217. The four subunits of DAHPS*Mn*PGL superimÊ pose with mean r.m.s.d. values of 0.28/0.51 A Ê for the main-chain atoms (variation: 0.262-0.294 A Ê and 0.475-0.544 A for all atoms) indicating that there is little variability in the overall folding of the individual subunits. Despite their similarity, the four subunits show signi®cant differences in model quality. Subunits A and C, which were less readily detected in the molecular replacement protocol, are also less well de®ned in the electron density maps, and have higher B factors. This observation is in agreement with the differences in the packing environment of the four individual molecules (Figure 2(b)). Subunit B has by far the largest portion of its accessible surface area buried by neighboring molecules, followed by subunit D. Furthermore, subunit B has signi®cantly lower average temperature factors than do the other subunits, and the correlation coef®cient in molecular

Neither the pairwise superposition of DAHPS*Mn*PGL subunits nor the comparison of DAHPS*Mn*PGL and DAHPS*Pb*PEP subunits (data not shown) suggest any major conformational differences within the overall fold of the subunits. Since a detailed description of the subunit structure has been given previously (Shumilin et al., 1999), we focus here on the observed differences between the Mn*PGL and the Pb*PEP derivatives of DAHPS. In the DAHPS(Phe)*Pb*PEP structure, a portion of the long b8/a8 loop is not de®ned. This loop segment (residues 313 to 317, indicated in red in Figure 3) could be traced in subunit B in DAHPS*Mn*PGL. This region appears to be stabilized through intermolecular contacts with an adjacent subunit (molecule 1 in Figure 2(b)) in the crystal. A comparison of main-chain f, c values for the respective B subunits of DAHPS*Mn*PGL and DAHPS*Pb*PEP con®rms that more than 95 % of those angles deviate less than 20  from each other. We note, however, signi®cant changes in three positions. The peptide bonds between residues 49 and 50, 114 and 115, and 320 and 321 are twisted by more than 90  in f and more than 100  in c. Since the data for DAHPS*Mn*PGL extend to a higher resolution than those of DAHPS*Pb*PEP and the electron density in these regions is well de®ned and unambiguous, we believe that the main-chain torsion angles observed in DAHPS*Mn*PGL are correct.

View of the B subunit of DAHPS(Phe) along the axis of the (b/a)8 barrel in approximately the same orientation as in Figure 2. b-strands are blue, a-helices are magenta, and 310 helices are either yellow (end of a3) or orange (end of b7 and start of a7). The conformation of the protein main chain between b7and a7 (residues 266 to 277, colored in orange) just before and after the metal coordinating His268 (side-chain shown as ball and stick model) is described in detail in the text. The location of Mn2 (green sphere), PGL, and the sulfate in the active site are indicated. The loop region 313-317 is red. This structure and those of Figures 4 and 5 were drawn with RIBBONS (Carson, 1997).

270 are designated 310 helix, as are residues 275 to 276. However, 268 to 270 extends b7 while 275 to 276 runs in the opposite direction and is at the beginning of a7. The residues in the turn 271 to 274 are oriented so that the carbonyl oxygen atom of His268 receives hydrogen bonds from the amide nitrogen atoms of residues n  3 (residue 271), n  4 (272), and n  5 (273), characteristic for 310, a, and p-helices, respectively. It is possible that this complex structure arises because the region between b7 and a7 contains 12 residues, somewhat unusual for a simple turn between a b-strand and an a-helix. In contrast, the other seven turns in DAHPS are either signi®cantly shorter (46 residues) or longer (524 residues). We speculate that, in response to the binding of E4P, the conformation of residues 266-277 changes to the more canonical a-helix, thereby acting as a switch for the repositioning of His268 and perhaps other residues within the active site. A recent analysis of noncanonical p-helix motifs revealed a high level of correlation between the occurrence of an p-helix and its involvement in forming specialized binding sites within proteins (Weaver, 2000).

DAHPS*Mn*PGL was crystallized in the presence of 0.1 M SO2À, as was DAHPS*Pb*PEP. In 4 DAHPS*Pb*PEP a sulfate ion is found at the entrance of the channel leading to PEP from the top of the barrel. This anion, which is held in place by hydrogen bonds or salt bridges to Arg99, Thr100, and Val102, is inferred to mark the phosphate site of E4P. Well de®ned electron density (10.5 s in a fourfold averaged Fo À Fc map) is found in DAHPS*Mn*PGL at exactly the same site (Figure 3). A second sphere of density (6.5 s) is found within hydrogen bond distance to the main chain nitrogen atoms of Ile193 and Lys194. In the DAHPS*Pb*PEP structure the Lys194 side-chain had been placed into this density. The strength and shape of the density in DAHPS*Mn*PGL suggest instead that this might be a second sulfate-binding site. There is no obvious function for this sulfate site and its binding is suggested to be adventitious. The 310 helical segment at the end of the canonical helix a3 (residues 150 to 153) in DAHPS*Pb*PEP, suggested to be involved in conformational changes in the enzyme upon binding of the feed-

394 back inhibitor, phenylalanine, (Shumilin et al., 1999), is also seen in DAHPS*Mn*PGL. Metal coordination The active site of DAHPS consists of a channel at the C-terminal end of the (b/a)8 barrel with bound Mn2 and PGL (Figure 4(a)). Despite their differences in activation, Mn2 is coordinated by the same four residues (Cys61, His268, Glu302, and Asp326) as is Pb2. The positions of the metals in the crystal structures of DAHPS*Pb*PEP and of Ê DAHPS*Mn*PGL are only 0.3 A apart. Mn2 is also coordinated by a well-de®ned water molecule that is within hydrogen bond distance to Lys97, a residue essential for catalytic activity. PGL is tilted so that one of its carboxylate oxygen atoms coordinates Mn2, thereby completing the octahedral coordination of the metal. This is in marked contrast to the situation in DAHPS*Pb*PEP, in which the coordination of metal and PEP involves the interaction between the 6 s2 lone pair of electrons of the Pb2 and the p conjugated system of PEP. The bond distances around Mn2 range from 2.0 to Ê 2.7 A (Table 3); bond angles range from 76 to 115  between adjacent ligands and from 148 to 167  between opposite ligands. The bond distances and angles of Pb2 are signi®cantly different from those of Mn2. These differences in metal coordination are probably the basis for the striking differences in activation by the two metals and strongly suggest that the role of the metal ion in the DAHPS reaction is at least partially structural, i.e. to position PEP in the active site. PGL coordination As with PEP in the DAHPS*Pb*PEP complex (Shumilin et al., 1999), the phosphate group of PGL interacts with a positively charged binding pocket formed by residues Lys186, Arg165, and Arg234, as well as with the main-chain nitrogen atom of Ala164 (Figure 4(a)). However, in contrast to PEP, the carboxylate end of PGL is rotated towards the metal binding site, thereby facilitating its coordination of the Mn2. This monodentate coordination of metal by the PGL carboxylate is similar to that found in the enolase*Zn*PGL complex from yeast (Lebioda et al., 1991). The docking of the phosphate moiety on the one end and the carboxylate group on the other correlates with the adoption by PGL

of the energetically less favorable eclipsed conformation with respect to the C2-O1P-P-O2P torsion angle. The active site residues of DAHPS*Mn*PGL superimpose with those of DAHPS*Pb*PEP Ê (Figure 4(b)) with an r.m.s.d. of 0.21/0.62 A, indicating that the binding of analog in place of substrate has little in¯uence on the structure within the cavity of the active site. There are, however, slight differences in the conformations of Arg92 and Arg234 (Figure 4(c)). Model for the active site Comparison of the structures of DAHPS*Mn*PGL and DAHPS*Pb*PEP provide the foundation for a model of the active site of DAHPS with both substrates bound (Figure 5). In this model, PEP is assumed to bind to the Mn-activated enzyme in the same orientation as PGL. E4P, modeled in its extended form with its phosphate group tethered to the sulfate site, has been rotated so that the two substrates are poised to interact in accordance with the established stereochemistry (Floss et al., 1972), i.e. with the si face of PEP attacking the re face of E4P. The C2-hydroxyl group of E4P is within hydrogen bonding distance of the water molecule that coordinates the Mn2. The O2 would Ê then be 2.0 A from a carboxylate oxygen atom of Asp326. This unfavorable contact could be relieved by a rotation of the aspartyl side-chain around w1 and/or a slight movement of the main-chain near Asp326 away from the metal site, as indicated by black arrows in Figure 5. In this alignment the disÊ tance between C3 of PEP and C1 of E4P is 3.4 A, indicating the need for movement of the reactants toward each other. This could be achieved by a rotation of the PEP plane around the C2 ÐO bond or by a displacement of the entire substrate up and towards the right upper corner about the Mn2. This latter movement, however, would probably make the proposed direct bond between the carboxylate oxygen atom of PEP and the metal impossible. A possible mechanism for the DAHPS reaction involves attack by a water molecule at C2 of PEP, thereby facilitating the addition of C3 of PEP to C1 of E4P (DeLeo et al., 1973). In such a mechanism, activation of the attacking water molecule could be provided by a residue acting as a general base to extract a proton from the water molecule. It is interesting that His268 (not shown in Figure 5) is

Data collection and processing Data were measured at beamline X4A at the NSLS, Ê Brookhaven, at a wavelength of 0.97935 A with an Raxis IV image plate detector from a single crystal maintained at À173  C. The data were processed and scaled with DENZO/SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Processing statistics are summarized in Table 1. Reduction of the integrated intensities was performed with TRUNCATE (CCP4, 1994). The B factor of the Ê Wilson plot is 19.2 A2. Even though the unit cell dimenÊ Ê sions of DAHPS*Mn*PGL (a  210.4 A, b  53.2 A, Ê c  149.4 A, b  116.1  ) are quite similar to those of Ê Ê Ê DAHPS*Pb*PEP (a  211.7 A, b  51.3 A, c  148.1 A, b  116.4  ), scaling of the two data sets resulted in an overall w2 value of >70, indicating a considerable lack of isomorphism between the two structures. Based on this ®nding we decided to solve the structure by molecular replacement using subunit C of the DAHPS*Pb*PEP structure as the search model.

Ê 3.4 A above and almost co-planar with PEP (Figure 4(c)), and thus is an excellent candidate for this catalytic residue. However, the Ne of its imidaÊ zole ring is 3.9 A from the metal-coordinated water molecule and, as positioned, His268 blocks the required approach of E4P to PEP. Thus, conformational changes in the active site would be necessary for activation of the enzyme. These would include movement of the b7/a7 loop to reposition His268 and to close the active site. The trigger for such movements could be the binding of E4P. An alternative to His268 as the required nucleophile in the reaction is Lys97, whose amine group is within hydrogen bond distance of the bound water molecule. Radaev et al. (2000) observed two peaks of density in the homolog KDOPS, crystallized in 1.4 M sulfate plus 0.4 M phosphate. One is at a position inferred to mark the phosphate of PEP and another Ê is about 3.0 A further out of the active-site cavity from the PEP phosphate group than is the inferred phosphate site of E4P in DAHPS. They suggested that these peaks mark the phosphate groups of the two substrates, PEP and A5P. We observed the same inner (PEP) peak in KDOPS, crystallized in 24 % (w/w) PEG in the presence of only 0.4 mM Ê PEP plus 1.0 mM A5P, and an outer peak 10.0 A away from the inner peak (Wagner et al., 2000). The occurrences of these two phosphate sites under very different conditions of crystallization of KDOPS are consistent with and reinforce the proposed similarity of catalytic mechanism of DAHPS and KDOPS, even though the latter does not require metal.

Structure solution and refinement In agreement with the observed non-crystallographic 222 symmetry of DAHPS*Pb*PEP the self rotation function search for DAHPS*Mn*PGL with the program GLRF (Tong & Rossmann, 1997) revealed three distinct peaks for k  180  : f/c  9  /75  (axis approximately parallel to a), 145/18 (parallel to b), and 96/78 (parallel to c). The highest peak (96/78) reached about 32 % of the peak, corresponding to the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis. The angles are within 2  of those obtained after superposition of the individual subunits from the ®nal model. The structure of DAHPS*Mn*PGL was solved by molecular replacement with the program package AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) as implemented in the CCP4 suite of programs (CCP4, 1994) using subunit C of the DAHPS*Pb*PEP structure as a search model. This subunit was chosen based on its low average B factor. Active-site ligands, Pb2, PEP, the missing N terminus, and the ¯exible loop between residues 312 and 318 were omitted from the model. After rigid-body re®nement the complete solution had a correlation coef®cient of 73.5 and an Ê R factor of 31.0 % (10.0-4.0 A data). The structure was re®ned with CNS versions 0.5 and È 1.0 (Brunger et al., 1998) using conventional positional re®nement protocols. Potential model bias from the DAHPS*Pb*PEP structure was minimized by one cycle of high temperature simulated annealing. Between re®nement cycles, models were checked against sigmaAweighted 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps and rebuilt in O (Jones et al., 1991). A restrained individual B factor re®nement was performed after each round of model building and positional re®nement. Optimization of the model consisted of the following steps: elimination of side-chains with no density in a 2Fo À Fc map contoured at 1.0 s; placement of the Mn2 into the four active-sites; rebuilding of the omitted active site residues; modeling of the loop region 313-317 in subunit B; addition of sulfate groups; and minor changes in side-chain conformations. Water molecules were added manually as they became visible in the electron density. Peaks were chosen based on their heights being >1.0 s in the 2Fo À Fc map and >3.0 s in the Fo À Fc map and on their having at least one protein atom or a water molecule from the ®rst Ê hydration sphere within 3.2 A suitable for hydrogen bonding.

Materials and Methods
Purification and crystallization DAHPS was puri®ed in the prescence of EDTA as described by Shumilin et al. (1995) and then dialyzed against Chelexed 1.0 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxy-methyl)methylamino]propane (BTP) at pH 7.0. The enzyme was crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. All solutions used for crystallization, except for MnSO4 and DAHPS were treated with Chelex-100 to remove metals. Crystals grew in 10 ml drops containing 0.20 mM DAHPS subunit (7.5 mg/ml), 0.37 mM MnSO4, 4.2 mM PGL, 0.1 M Li2SO4, and 12 % (w/v) PEG 1000 in 50 mM BTP buffer (pH 8.7). The reservoir solution contained 19 % PEG 1000, 0.1 M Li2SO4, and 20 % (v/v) ethanol in 50 mM BTP buffer (pH 8.7). For diffraction analysis the drops were covered with mineral oil and crystals were picked up with a loop and ¯ash-frozen in an evaporating stream from liquid nitrogen. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space Ê group C2 with unit cell dimensions a  210.36 A, Ê Ê b  53.18 A, c  149.39 A, b  116.09  , with four subunits per asymmetric unit. The Matthews coef®cient is Ê 2.5 Da AÀ3.

As in the DAHPS*Pb*PEP structure, the N termini (6 to 7 residues) of each of the four subunits are disordered and could not be traced. The ¯exible loop (residues 313 to 317) could be unambiguously identi®ed in subunit B where it is stabilized by intermolecular contacts with a symmetry mate. The current model includes 10,972 non-hydrogen atoms from 1361 amino acid residues, four Mn2, four PGL molecules, eight sulfate ions, and 740 water molecules. 172 (4 Â 43) of these water

molecules appear in all four subunits, as analyzed with the program WATNCS (CCP4, 1994). Residues for which there is no visible side-chain density are treated as alanine residues. The re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 2. The initial model for PGL was taken from Lis (1993), ®t into the Fo À Fc density, and then subjected to geometry optimization with an extended MM2 force ®eld (Allinger, 1977) as implemented in the CAChe program

Figure 4. Comparison of the active sites of DAHPS*Mn*PGL and DAHPS*Pb*PEP. (a) Active site of DAHPS*Mn*PGL viewed down the channel of the barrel as seen by an approaching E4P. The distances between Ê Mn2 (green) and the six ligands range from 2.0 to 2.7 A and are listed in Table 3. Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges from Arg92, Lys97, Arg165, Lys186, Arg234, and the water molecule to PGL are broken lines. (b) The active site of DAHPS*Pb*PEP in the same orientation as in (a). The distances between Pb2 (green) and the planar portion of PEP Ê (broken orange lines) range from 3.6 to 3.9 A. Hydrogen bonds are broken. (c) Superposition of the active sites of DAHPS*Mn*PGL (green/cyan) and DAHPS*Pb*PEP (red/orange). View and labeling as in (a). The metal ions are green and red spheres; the second green sphere is the water molecule bound to Mn2. All residues are shown with their side-chains only, except for Ala164 whose main-chain is also indicated.

package (Cache, 1999). Target distances for re®nement were obtained from a table of bond lengths based on a CSD database search (Allen et al., 1987), angles were adapted from the optimized structure. Partial charges È were calculated with the Extended Huckel method as implemented in CAChe.

The stereochemistry of the model was analyzed with È CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). In order to calculate the buried surface areas Ê all symmetry-related molecules within 6.0 A of the original tetramer were generated using crystallographic symmetry operators. Structural comparisons including

Figure 5. Model of substrate binding at the active site. PEP is assumed to bind in the same orientation as does PGL. The phosphate group of E4P has been tethered to the sulfate site. Hydrogen bonds involving the water molecule bound to the metal are shown as broken lines. Ê The distance between C3 of PEP and C1 of E4P is 3.4 A (dark broken line). This could be reduced by a movement of PEP towards the second substrate (black arrow). In this orientation, however, a direct bond between a carboxylate oxygen atom and Mn2, as assumed in our model, would not be feasible. In accordance with the established stereochemistry (Floss et al., 1972) for the catalytic reaction, the si face of PEP is facing the re face of E4P for the attack. As indicated, there is an unacceptable van der Waals contact involving O2 of E4P and the carboxylate group of Asp326. This could be relieved by a 90  rotation of the aspartyl side-chain about w1, away from the Mn2, thereby weakening the Mn Ð O bond and/or drawing the Mn2 away from its coordinating water (black arrows).

residues 9 to 311 and 319 to 349 from each protein chain were performed with CNS utility programs or LSQMAN (Kleywegt, 1999). The locations of the non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axes were determined with the program FIT (http://bioinfo1.mbfys.lu.se/ $ guoguang/ ®t.html). Coordinates of DAPHS*Mn*PGL have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with PDB code 1GG1.
