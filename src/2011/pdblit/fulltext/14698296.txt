The Chain Register in Heterotrimeric Collagen Peptides Affects Triple Helix Stability and Folding Kinetics
` Barbara Sacca, Christian Renner and Luis Moroder*
Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany Collagen type IV is a highly specialized form of collagen found only in basement membranes, where it provides mechanical stability and structural integrity to tissues and organs, and binding sites for cell adhesion. In its ubiquitous form, collagen type IV consists of two a1 chains and one a2 chain, whose internal alignment within the triple helix seems to exert a strong influence on the binding affinity to a1b1 integrin receptor. This has been assessed recently using two synthetic collagen peptides that contain the cell adhesion epitope of collagen type IV and are assembled into the most plausible a1a2a10 and a2a1a10 registers. In the present study, the effects of the chain register on the stability of the triple helix and the folding kinetics of these collagen peptides were investigated by CD spectroscopy and microcalorimetry. The results revealed a multidomain structural organization for both trimers, with an unexpected strong effect of the chain alignment on the conformational stability. Molecular dynamics simulations served to rationalize more properly the experimental results.

Introduction
Collagens are abundant protein components of the extracellular matrix, which provide mechanical strength and structural integrity to various tissues. These proteins are structurally unique molecules, consisting of three identical or different a chains of primarily Gly-Xaa-Yaa sequence repeats, where Xaa is often proline and Yaa hydroxyproline. This type of sequence composition favors a left-handed polyPro-II helix conformation of the single chains and their intertwining with a one residue shift into a right-handed triple-helical coiled coil stabilized by an extensive repetitive hydrogen bonding network.1 ­ 3 The most representative forms of this protein family are the collagens from type I to IV. Due to the size and the fibrous nature of the interstitial collagens type I, II and III, and to the complex network formed by collagen type IV, detailed information about their structure and

stability has been obtained mainly by appropriate model peptides such as the self-associated homotrimers [(Pro-Pro-Gly)10]3 and [(Pro-Hyp-Gly)10]3, and related analogs and homologs.4,5 Various more recent X-ray crystallographic analyses of such model peptides6 ­ 14 fully confirmed the basic structural features of the triple helix, but raised the question about the effect of ring puckering of the proline residues and of the peptide hydration pattern on the stability of the triple helix. Although localized hydration sites represent an intrinsic feature of the collagen triple helix,8,13 ­ 16 a "hopping" hydration mechanism has been proposed, with fast exchange of water molecules at the solvation sites17 and thus with minor effects on collagen stability.18,19 In folding of native collagens, the globular C-terminal domains, often involving interchain disulfide bridges, play a decisive role in chain recognition, association, registration and finally nucleation of the triple helix. The latter proceeds then in a zipper-like mode from the C to the N terminus with the cis/trans-isomerization of peptidyl ­ imino acid bonds as the rate-limiting process.20,21 Without these oligomerization and nucleation domains, triple helix formation is very

Cell-Adhesion Epitope of Collagen Type IV

Figure 1. Synthetic heterotrimeric collagen peptides A and B containing the sequence portions 457­ 468 of collagen type IV where the a1b1 integrin recognition site was localized.30 The critical non-sequential RDD motif is indicated in bold italic characters. The three a chains were assembled into the two most plausible registers, i.e. a1a2a10 and a2a1a10 for the heterotrimer A and B, respectively.

slow and mismatched triple helices are often formed.22 Since refolding experiments on collagen type III clearly revealed that the native interchain disulfide bridges at the C terminus are sufficient to function as efficient nucleation centers,20 natural oligomerization and nucleation domains of collagens were frequently mimicked by covalent crosslinking of the collagenous peptide chains in various synthetic modes23 or, more recently, by exploiting the bacteriophage T4 fibritin foldon domain24 or the complex cystine-knot domain of collagen type III, so far of unknown disulfide connectivities.25 All these modes of assembly of the chains lead to trimers that fold with concentration-independent rate constants into triple helices of remarkably enhanced thermal stability. To mimic native collagen nucleation more closely, we applied a simplified C-terminal cystine-knot for covalent assembly of synthetic collagenous peptides into heterotrimers whose desired register was obtained by exploiting a regioselective cysteine chemistry.26 With this synthetic

approach, heterotrimers related to the collagenase cleavage site of collagen type I were synthesized that allowed for a more detailed characterization of the mechanism of proteolysis of collagen and gelatin by collagenases and gelatinases, respectively.27 Adopting the identical strategy, we have recently synthesized heterotrimers28,29 as mimics of the non-sequential a1b1 integrin binding site of collagen type IV.30 Since this adhesion epitope results from a defined display of the involved residues on different chains, it was expected to depend upon the triple-helical fold, and decisively even upon the stagger of the single chains within the triple helix. Accordingly, the three chains were aligned in the two most plausible a1a2a10 and a2a1a10 registers, as shown in Figure 1 for the heterotrimers A and B, respectively. As expected, affinity studies fully confirmed the importance of the chain register on the selectivity of binding, revealing a higher affinity of the a1b1 integrin for the trimer B with its a2a1a10 register.31 The compact triple-helical fold of collagens imposes significant structural limitations on the complementarity of binding domains of interacting proteins such as integrins. Preliminary conformational analysis of the heterotrimers A and B yielded strong evidence for a triple-helical fold extending from the C to the N terminus, whose cooperative thermal denaturation was affected significantly by the chain alignment within the triple helix, resulting in a tm of 30 8C for the trimer B and of 42 8C for the trimer A.28 The more detailed comparative structural characterization of the two heterotrimers, described here, revealed a multidomain structural organization that would support the hypothesis of local fluctuations of the triple helices that could account for slightly differentiated induced fits in the binding to the integrin receptor.

Results
Design of the heterotrimeric collagen peptides For the design and synthesis of the heterotrimeric collagen peptides A and B, containing the adhesion epitope of collagen type IV for a1b1 integrin, an artificial C-terminal cystine-knot was used to cross-link in a regioselective manner the three synthetic chains into the a1a2a10 (A) and a2a1a10 (B) trimers (Figure 1). These represent the two most plausible registers of collagen type IV as derived from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments performed on a related fragment (F2 sub-fragment of CB3(IV)).32 Moreover, to assure the required triple-helical conformation of the target molecules, the sequence portions 457­ 468 of the a1 and a2 chains of collagen type IV, which are known to contain the integrin adhesion motif,30 were extended with two and three (Gly-Pro-Hyp) repeats at the C and N terminus, respectively. This tripeptide repeat, in

With the available X-ray structures, all resolved for homotrimeric collagen-like peptides, it is difficult to assign the observed differences to changes of direct or waterbridged side-chain interactions.

Thermal unfolding (--) and refolding (­ ­ ­ ) curves monitored at 222 nm in the temperature range from 4 to 70 8C for the heterotrimer A (left panel) and B (right panel) at a concentration of 3 £ 1025 M in 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2·2H2O. The CD spectra after refolding match the initial CD profile upon 12 hours incubation at 4 8C after the refolding process (X).

Thermal unfolding and refolding of the heterotrimers Thermal denaturation and refolding of the heterotrimers A and B were monitored by the CD signal at 222 nm in the temperature range from 4 to 70 8C with a heating rate of 0.2 deg. C/minute. In contrast to what we observed for heterotrimers related to the collagenase cleavage site of collagen type I,36 the unfolding and refolding traces of the two trimers (Figure 2) are not superimposable, and thus reminiscent of a hysteresis according to which the system replies with a retardation of the effect upon the external physical change. However, this phenomenon results from a kinetic, rather than a thermodynamic effect, i.e. an ideal superimposition of the unfolding and refolding traces might be obtained by a sufficiently slow cooling rate. This apparently hindered refolding of collagens has been attributed to kinetic restrictions, i.e. to difficulties of the three a-chains in finding the correct alignment.37 The kinetic hysteresis is more pronounced for the heterotrimer A with its more stable, and thus probably more tightly packed, triple helix, than for the heterotrimer B. However, in both cases the process is fully reversible, as confirmed by the identity of the CD spectra of the peptides measured at 4 8C before denaturation and after 12 hours incubation at the same temperature upon refolding. In order to gain a better insight into the renaturation mechanism of the two heterotrimeric collagen peptides, kinetic studies of the refolding processes were performed at different temperatures. The dichroic intensities at 222 nm were monitored as a function of time upon complete denaturation of the peptides at 80 8C followed by a temperaturejump to the desired refolding temperature. The activation energies were extracted from the Arrhenius plots of these rate constants (Table 2). As shown in Figure 3 (left panel) for the heterotrimer A, the refolding process occurs in two clearly separate steps: a first, fast phase, which is not resolved kinetically and presents a relative amplitude of ca 50% refolding; and a second, slow phase whose amplitude is smoothly approaching the end value. This latter, slower profile was best fit by a first-order rate law, with a zero-time correction of ca 600 seconds, and a rate constant of 0.44 £ 1023 s21 at 4 8C. For the heterotrimer B (Figure 3, right panel) at 4 8C a rate constant of 0.39 £ 1023 s21 was derived.

fact, is known to represent the optimal sequence composition for induction and stabilization of the collagen fold.33 ­ 35 The heterotrimeric collagen peptides were obtained as analytically wellcharacterized compounds.28

Conformational characterization of the heterotrimers The overall conformational properties of the heterotrimers A and B were assessed by CD,28 and the most relevant data are summarized in Table 1. Both heterotrimers exhibit CD spectra characteristic of the collagen triple helix with almost identical Rpn values (, 0.1). Thermal unfolding of both trimers occurs in a cooperative transition that strongly supports a triple-helical structure spanning the entire molecules from the C to the N terminus. However, the trimers differ significantly in their thermal stabilities (tm ¼ 42 8C for trimer A and tm ¼ 30 8C for trimer B), although consisting of identical chains and differing only in their C-terminal cystine-knots (Figure 1). Therefore, the different thermal stabilities have to derive mainly from their different register. The collagen triple helix is known to be stabilized by a very regular hydrogen bonding network with all Gly amide groups of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats hydrogen-bonded to the Pro carbonyl groups in position Xaa of the adjacent chain,7 ­ 9,15 while the hydration shell apparently does not conTable 2.

The first fast phase (W) is not resolved kinetically, while the second slow phase is best fit with a first-order kinetic law.

These rate constants are very similar to those obtained previously for a similar heterotrimer construct containing the collagenase cleavage site of collagen type I (0.56 £ 1023 s21 at 4 8C).36 Similar values were determined for homotrimeric constructs based on the C-terminal extension of (Gly-Pro-Pro)10 either with the trimeric foldon domain of phage T4 (0.7 £ 1023 s21 at 7 8C) or with the complex cystine-knot of collagen type III (0.12 £ 1023 s21 at 7 8C).25 Finally, an analogous rate constant was determined for the refolding of procollagen type IV (0.68 £ 1023 s21 at 25 8C).38 All these values are markedly lower than the rate constant of refolding determined for the fragment Col 1-3 of type III procollagen containing a native complex cystine-knot C-terminally (8 £ 1023 s21 at 20 8C).39 The results clearly indicate that in both trimers the cystine-knot acts as a permanent nucleation center. The activation energies of 13.5 kJ mol21 and 12.8 kJ mol21 for tri-

mer A and B, respectively, are significantly lower than those determined for the two homotrimeric (Gly-Pro-Pro)10 constructs (Ea ¼ 54.5 kJ mol21 for (Gly-Pro-Pro)10 foldon and 52.5 kJ mol21 for (GlyPro-Pro)10-Cys2),25 as well as others reported for short proline-containing peptides,40 collagens,41 and collagen model peptides.42 This difference may well derive from the lower content of imino acids present in the heterotrimers A and B, since

In the refolding process the peaks (red broken line) are shifted to lower temperatures by about 9 deg. C and exhibit lower intensities according to the kinetic hysteresis already observed in the CD experiments (see Figure 2).

The C-terminal cystine knot domain (peak III in Figures 4 and 5) is absent.

the main contribution to the activation energy has to be attributed to the cis/trans isomerization of the peptidyl ­ imino acid bonds. These results confirm that refolding kinetics are affected by the particular sequence composition of the a chains, and suggest a marginal effect of their relative arrangement within the triple helix (Table 2). Thermodynamic properties and multi-domain structure of the heterotrimers Thermal denaturation of peptides and proteins is often treated on the basis of a two-state transition model, according to which the probability of existence of all intermediate states between the native and the denatured ones is very low and thus the protein appears as a single cooperative system.

However, this is not always the case, and unfolding cannot be considered a priori as a two-state transition. This is especially true for collagens whose thermal denaturation is known to exhibit rather unusual thermodynamic properties, which cannot be described simply by a two-state transition model. A correct thermodynamic characterization of these molecules can be obtained by direct calorimetric measurements of changes in enthalpy and entropy regardless of the assumptions on the transition process.15 For this purpose, unfolding and refolding of the heterotrimers A and B was monitored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the corresponding endotherms and exotherms are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The reversibility of the processes was confirmed by superimposition of the CD spectra at 4 8C before denaturation and 12 hours after the renaturation. However, it is worth noting that, although the shape and the deconvoluted peaks of the exotherms in the refolding processes are substantially similar to those obtained for the endotherms during unfolding, their intensities and tm values are slightly lower, in agreement with the kinetic hysteresis observed by CD measurements (data shown only for the heterotrimer B, Figure 5). In addition, denaturation experiments were performed on the a1(StBu) A chain (Figure 6), since unlike the other two monomers, this a1 monomer is capable of selfassociating into a homotrimer.28 By comparing the calorimetric profiles of the disulfide-bridged heterotrimers with those of the self-associated homotrimer a1(StBu), the thermodynamic contribution of the cystine-knot could be assigned (peak III in Figures 4 and 5). The changes in total calorimetric enthalpy (DHcal) and van't Hoff enthalpy (DHVH) for the triplehelix ! random-coil transitions of both heterotrimers are given in Table 3. A comparison of the experimental data effectively confirmed the inadequacy of a two-state transition model to account for the unfolding processes of the heterotrimers, as indicated by the ratios of DHcal/DHVH of , 3 (Table 3). Indeed, for the case of a two-state transition process, this ratio should be equal to 1.15 Deconvolution analysis of the thermal transition curves of the heterotrimers A and B allowed to identify a multi-domain structural organization of the collagen peptides. This consists of three cooperative subunits, which can be attributed to three different domains with distinct melting temperatures as well as different enthalpic and entropic contributions to the overall unfolding process (Table 4). These three subunits can be assigned to three different regions of the molecule with the following order of thermal stability: i.e. the central adhesion epitope with a less stable and less regular triple-helical structure, the regular (Gly-Pro-Hyp) triple-helical repeats (three and two in the N and C terminus, respectively) and the C-terminal cystine-knot stabilized by the interchain disulfide

bridges. Assignment of each domain to its corresponding melting peak was based on comparative analysis of the calorimetric curves (Figures 4­ 6) and on assumptions derived from the stability of collagen model peptides.43 Since the order of stability of the three domains within the collagenous peptides is related directly to the order in which the single structural domains unfold upon heating, we can reasonably suppose that the refolding of the trimers follows the reverse order, i.e. the C-terminal cystine-knot should be the first to fold, followed by the (Gly-Pro-Hyp) repeats and finally by the central part of the molecule. This would confirm that folding of the triple helix starts from the C-terminal cystine-knot as the nucleation center. However, the order by which the three regions fold upon cooling would not correspond to their spatial contiguity within the collagen molecule, thus preventing a refolding of the molecule in a zipper-like fashion from the C to the N terminus. As a consequence, the central portion suffers from difficulties in matching correctly the a chains already constrained at both ends into a triple helix. This fact could well account for the observed kinetic hysteresis of the collagenous peptides, particularly in the case of the heterotrimer A, because of its more compact and rigid structure, which requires a more precise matching of the three a chains. Molecular dynamics simulations In an effort to obtain some microscopic understanding of the processes that were characterized thermodynamically with microcalorimetry measurements, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on both trimers in a water box. After initial equilibration starting from an ideal triple helical backbone conformation, the system was heated gradually from 10 to 500 K during 150 ps and a further 500 ps were simulated at 500 K. For both trimers, the first deviations from the triple-helical conformation were observed at the end of the heating period in the middle part of the molecule, which contains the cell adhesion motif of collagen type IV. Surprisingly, the GlyPro-Hyp repeats, with the exception of the most N-terminal, remained in the triple-helix conformation even after 500 ps at 500 K (Figure 7). The

typical hydrogen bond network was largely maintained in the Gly-Pro-Hyp regions with transient breaking of hydrogen bonds. Conversely, for the integrin recognition site, even at low temperatures in the beginning of the simulation, not all of the Gly amide protons were involved in a hydrogen bond. However, during the high-temperature part of the MD simulations, marked deviations from a triple-helical conformation evolved in the central region of both trimers, leading to a kink between the (Gly-Pro-Hyp) regions (Figure 7(c)). Such deviations from the starting conformation are more pronounced for the heterotrimer B, and extend over a larger part of the sequence of the peptide, as observed from the comparison of the backbone dihedral angles F and C, at the beginning and at the end of the simulations. Thus, trimer B unfolds in our simulations more rapidly than trimer A, with the cell adhesion site being the first part of the molecule to lose its native structure. Therefore, the results obtained by MD simulations support our interpretation of the

multi-step unfolding of the heterotrimers as observed in the microcalorimetric experiments.

Discussion
It is known that the collagen triple-helix has to undergo major conformational changes in the integrin adhesion region upon binding.44 Therefore, as the triple-helical conformation of this region is less stable in trimer B, adaptation to the integrin-binding surface by "induced fit" might be easier in this case and thus could explain the higher binding affinity of trimer B when compared to trimer A.31 Interestingly, the conformational changes observed in the MD simulated unfolding, namely formation of a kink in the integrin-binding region (Figure 7(c)), are similar to the changes observed upon binding in the X-ray structure of the integrin ­collagen complex.44 However, it should be noted that the multi-step unfolding and the domain organization of these heterotrimers became visible only in the calorimetric experiments, whereas in the more common CD melting curves these features are practically invisible and small indications can be found only a posteriori with the knowledge derived from the DSC measurements. On the basis of comparative analysis of the calorimetric curves (Figures 4 ­ 6) and on assumptions derived from the stability of collagen model peptides,43 each domain of the collagen molecule was assigned to its corresponding melting peak in the calorimetric profile. Accordingly, the disulfidebridged C-terminal domain was assigned to the calorimetric peak that is present in both endotherms of the heterotrimers A and B at the highest melting temperature (tm of 57 8C, peak III in Figures 4 and 5) and is, conversely, absent from the melting profile of the self-associated homotrimer (Figure 6). The small enthalpic contribution of the cystine-knot domain (III in Table 4) derives from the relatively small size of this domain (approximately one triplet) when compared to the other two, with a consequently small number of interactions disrupted upon thermal denaturation. The contribution of this domain to the total entropy change is even smaller, as the disulfide bridges strongly restrict the conformational freedom, thus resulting in the highest melting temperature (Tm ¼ DH/DS ). The regular triple-helical (Gly-Pro-Hyp) repeats were assigned to the central calorimetric peak with a tm of 44 8C for both heterotrimers. Both the N-terminal and the C-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp) repeats were supposed to have a very similar thermal stability, since they differ by only one triplet. This hypothesis is supported by the small line-width of the corresponding calorimetric profile (peak II in Figures 4 and 5), reflecting the strong cooperativity in unfolding of these regular repeats. Finally, the central adhesion domain with its lower triple-helical stability was assigned to the first melting peak with a tm of 38 8C and

32 8C for the heterotrimers A and B, respectively (peak I in Figures 4 and 5). The borders of domain I within the collagen molecules appear to be different in the case of trimers A and B, as evidenced by the different enthalpic contributions (Table 4) as well as by the different shapes of the deconvoluted calorimetric peaks (cf. Figures 4 and 5). In fact, for trimer A, the relative enthalpic contribution of domain I is 44% and thus only slightly smaller than the contribution of domain II (Table 4). This is in good agreement with the assumption that domain I in trimer A comprises exactly the integrin adhesion epitope made up of four (Gly-Xaa-Yaa) triplets, whereas domain II consists of a total of five (Gly-Pro-Hyp) repeats: three at the N terminus and two at the C terminus. Conversely, the enthalpic contribution of domain I in trimer B is substantially larger than that of domain II, probably because of an extension of the central domain beyond the restricted region of the integrin adhesion site. This would suggest that in the chain register of trimer B, the adhesion epitope causes a disturbing effect on the regular triple-helical structure of directly neighboring (Gly-Pro-Hyp) repeats, whereas in the chain register of trimer A, such an effect is not observed. This interpretation is supported by the results obtained by MD simulations. Although the selectivity of binding of the heterotrimers A and B for the integrin receptor can be rationalized by the different display of the interacting side-chains and the different readiness for an induced fit, their difference in thermal stability remains puzzling. The enthalpy associated with the collagen triple-helix denaturation should result mainly from disruption of the extensive interchain hydrogen bonding network.15,16 This is confirmed nicely by the fact that in the MD simulations at room temperature, an average of 29 hydrogen bonds are observed. Therefore, assuming a value of 16 kJ mol21 for each hydrogen bond, the resulting change in enthalpy is qualitatively in agreement with that measured. As the two heterotrimers differ only in the alignment of the a chains, the hydrogen bonding pattern would be expected to be very similar in both registers, giving rise to the same increase in enthalpy upon denaturation. However, a difference in enthalpy change of 22 kJ mol21 has been obtained for the two heterotrimers, corresponding approximately to one hydrogen bond (Table 3). The increase in enthalpy change for the trimer A is counteracted by a concomitant increase in entropy change (Table 3), which may well be attributed to a tighter triple-helical packing of the central portion in the trimer A compared to trimer B. Additionally, the hydration shell of the collagen helix has been claimed to stabilize this structure significantly,8,13 ­ 16 supported by well-localized water-binding sites as observed in almost all X-ray structures of collagenlike model peptides.7 ­ 10,13,14 A different display of the side-chains in the two trimers could well provoke changes in the water shell, but this water shell

316

should not provide significant binding energy, because of the loss of entropy during formation of the water-bridges.18 Moreover, the water in such bridges exchanges rapidly with unbound water,17 as observed generally in proteins,45 and thus such water-bridges should contribute to the overall stability only marginally.18,19 Significant changes in side-chain interactions that would account for the observed different stabilities could not be visualized in the MD simulations. Therefore, only a comparative X-ray analysis of the two crystalline heterotrimers may possibly resolve the puzzle, although packing of the molecules in the crystal matrix may well freeze both heterotrimers into an ideal triple helix, suppressing the apparently stronger disturbances of the triple helix in heterotrimer B compared to heterotrimer A. Nonetheless, crystallization experiments are in progress in an attempt to identify the main structural features responsible for the unexpected effect of the chain register on the thermal stability of collagen-like molecules.

The thermal denaturation and renaturation curves were recorded as a variation of the heat capacity (Cp) versus the temperature in the range 4 ­ 70 8C, using a scan rate of 0.2 deg. C/minute. Data analysis was performed with the Origin software modified for microcalorimetric applications (MicroCal, Northampton, USA) using the non-two-state transition model.15 Molecular dynamics simulations MD simulations were carried out with the DISCOVER module of the INSIGHTII-2000 software (Accelrys, San Diego) for trimer A and trimer B in a water box of size 12 nm £ 4 nm £ 4 nm containing about 6000 water molecules. For both trimers, the backbone conformation was forced onto the backbone of the PDB structure 1CLG of (PPG)12.46 Then water molecules were added and minimized, keeping the respective trimer fixed. MD simulation was started at 10 K with the trimer backbone tethered to the starting conformation with 100 kcal mol21 A22. After 30 ps, tethering was removed and a further 10 ps were simulated at 10 K followed by gradual heating (with time constant 1 ps) to 100 K during 20 ps. At this point, temperature-bath coupling was reduced (time constant 5 ps) and the temperature was raised to 300 K. After 100 ps, the temperature was set to the final value of 500 K and 600 ps were simulated. In all simulations, the CVFF force-field was used and the step size was 1 fs. Snapshots were saved each picosecond during equilibration and during heating to 500 K; then the configuration was saved only every 5 ps.

Materials and Methods
Circular dichroism measurements The CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostatically controlled cell holder and connected to a PC for signal averaging and processing. All spectra were recorded in the 190 ­250 nm range, employing quartz cuvettes of 0.1 cm optical path-length (Hellma GmbH, Baden, Germany). The average of ten scans is reported and expressed in terms of ellipticity per mole of peptide residues (uR). The measurements were performed on peptide solutions equilibrated at 4 8C for at least 12 hours, at a concentration of 3 £ 1025 M in Tris buffer (50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2·2H2O), unless stated differently. The concentrations were determined by weight and peptide content as determined by quantitative amino acid analysis of the synthetic heterotrimers.28 Thermal denaturation and renaturation of the trimers were monitored by the change in the dichroic intensity at 222 nm as a function of temperature in the range 4 ­ 70 8C with a heating rate of 0.2 deg. C/min. After denaturation at 80 8C for one hour, the kinetics of refolding of the trimers were monitored at 222 nm upon 30 seconds of thermal shock at the desired refolding temperature, ranging from 4 to 40 8C. Differential scanning calorimetry The temperature-dependence of the partial heat capacity was determined on a VP-DSC microcalorimeter from MicroCal (Northampton, USA) equipped with a cell feedback network and two fixed-in-place cells with effective volumes of ca 0.5 ml. The measurements were accomplished with peptide solutions at a concentration of ca 8 £ 1025 M in water and pre-equilibrated at 4 8C for at least 12 hours. Measurement of the a1(StBu) chain was performed at a concentration of 3 £ 1024 M in water upon incubation of the peptide at 4 8C for 24 hours in order to assure its self-association into homotrimers.
