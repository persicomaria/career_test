Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase/phosphoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase (PAICS) is an important bifunctional enzyme in de novo purine biosynthesis in vertebrate with both 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide carboxylase (AIRc) and 4-(N-succinylcarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (SAICARs) activities. It becomes an attractive target for rational anticancer drug design, since rapidly dividing cancer cells rely heavily on the purine de novo pathway for synthesis of adenine and guanine, whereas normal cells favor the salvage pathway. Here, we report the crystal structure of human PAICS, the first in the entire PAICS family, at 2.8 Å resolution. It revealed that eight PAICS subunits, each composed of distinct AIRc and SAICARs domains, assemble a compact homo-octamer with an octameric-carboxylase core and four symmetric periphery dimers formed by synthetase domains. Based on structural comparison and functional complementation analyses, the active sites of SAICARs and AIRc were identified, including a putative substrate CO2-binding site. Furthermore, four symmetry-related, separate tunnel systems in the PAICS octamer were found that connect the active sites of AIRc and SAICARs. This study illustrated the octameric nature of the bifunctional enzyme. Each carboxylase active site is formed by structural elements from three AIRc domains, demonstrating that the octamer structure is essential for the carboxylation activity. Furthermore, the existence of the tunnel system implies a mechanism of intermediate channeling and suggests that the quaternary structure arrangement is crucial for effectively executing the sequential reactions. In addition, this study provides essential structural information for designing PAICS-specific inhibitors for use in cancer chemotherapy.

Structure of Human PAICS

Introduction
De novo purine biosynthesis pathway is ubiquitous across all living species and catalyzes the conversion of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP). Nearly half a century ago, Buchanan and co-workers demonstrated that ten enzymatic reactions are needed to complete such a conversion in vertebrates.1,2 It has become clear that rapidly dividing cancer cells rely heavily on this de novo purine pathway for synthesis of adenine and guanine, in contrast to normal cells that favor a salvage pathway.3 Further research indicated that many cancers (e.g. approximately 30% of all T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia) lack the salvage pathway for adenine nucleotide synthesis and rely entirely on the de novo purine biosynthesis.4 Therefore, enzymes involved in the de novo pathway have become attractive candidates for rational anticancer drug design. Despite of intensive studies aimed at obtaining a deeper understanding of each step of this critical pathway, many details of the reactions remain vague. Until now, only the 3D structure of ATIC (AICAR transformylase and IMP cyclohydrolase), which catalyzes the final two reactions in the de novo purine synthesis in vertebrates, has been reported.5,6 Nevertheless, with an effort to obtain anticancer molecules, this initial structural study has been followed by a number of studies on ATIC complexes with a variety of ligands.5,7­10 In vertebrates, phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase/ phosphoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase (PAICS) is a bifunctional enzyme with both 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) carboxylase (AIRc) and 4-(N-succinylcarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (SAICAR) synthetase (SAICARs) activities. It catalyzes steps 6 and 7 of the de novo purine biosynthesis (Figure 1). AIRc uses both AIR and CO2 as substrates to produce 4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR);11 in contrast, its homologous enzyme in Escherichia coli, EcPurE, is a mutase catalyzing the rearrangement of N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (N5-CAIR, i.e. the PurK reaction product)

to CAIR12 thus does not use CO2 as a substrate. Stubbe and co-workers designated PurE enzymes in prokaryotes, yeast, and plants as class I PurE and AIRc enzymes in other higher eukaryotes as class II PurE.13,14 Crystal structures of class I PurE illustrate that the enzyme forms a functional octamer,15­18 albeit details of the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme remain unclear. Moreover, SAICARs is an ATP-dependent synthetase catalyzing the conversion of CAIR, l-aspartate, and ATP to SAICAR, ADP and phosphate (Figure 1). Crystal structures of the SAICARs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Thermotoga maritima, and E. coli have been reported.19­21 In contrast to this progress in structural studies on class I PurE and SAICARs, little is known about the 3D structure of the bifunctional PAICS; not the spatial organization of the two functional units, their communication, or potential cooperation. In order to better understand the molecular mechanism of the purine biosynthetic pathway and to develop attractive drug targets for potential cancer treatments, we determined the crystal structure of human PAICS at 2.8 Å resolution. Here, we report its octameric structure, which reveals a subunit structure comprised of two distinct domains and a compact octamer assembled of one octameric AIRc complex and four dimers of SAICARs domains. Formation of each AIRc active site requires structural components from three subunits, whereas the partially enclosed SAICARs active site is relatively independent of subunit interactions. Furthermore, the existence of a complex, octamerdependent, tunnel system implies a mechanism of intermediate channeling.

Results and Discussion
Crystal structure and the two-domain monomer of PAICS The crystal structure of human PAICS, with one protein molecule per asymmetric unit and a VM of 2.8 Å3/Da, was determined using the multiple-

1605 at the N-terminal region of SAICARs (residues Glu15­Thr19) and between strands 7 and 8 (Lys131­Pro138), respectively (Figure 4(a) and (b)), form lids partly covering the long cleft, and potentially have roles in substrate binding. Helices 1 and 5 from the S and L subdomains form a parallel helix pair and are roughly perpendicular to the edges of -sheets in both subdomains. On the side of the L subdomain -sheet opposite from the above-mentioned cleft, the longest -helix in the SAICARs domain, a six-turn helix, 4 runs across the diagonal of the -sheet and is wrapped by the latter on three sides, with the remaining side left for intramolecular interaction with the AIRc domain. All three above-mentioned disordered regions in the PAICS crystal structure are located in the SAICARs domain. Superposition of this human SAICARs domain (HSAICARs) with those of E. coli SAICARs (EcSAICARs, which shares 32.1% sequence identity with HSAICARs), Thermotoga maritima SAICARs (TmSAICARs, 33.5%), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAICARs (ScSAICARs, 20.3%) indicated that their peptide folds are fairly similar (Figure 4(c)). For example, the most similar 3D structure is that of TmSAICARs (PDB file 1KUT) with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.4 Å for 190 C atom pairs between Tm- and HSAICARs. Nevertheless, two major structural differences were observed between HSAICARs and other SAICARs proteins being compared (Figure 4(c)): One is associated with the insertion of the short -hairpin (i.e. 9­10) in HSAICARs. Underneath this hairpin, there is a hydrophobic pocket whose function is unclear at this time. The second structural variation occurs near the C terminus of the L subdomain affected by the connection with the downstream AIRc domain. The AIRc domain contains a globular central domain and a projecting C-terminal helix (Figure 5). The core domain is composed of a five-stranded, parallel -sheet with a strand order of 16-15-1718-19, flanked by three  helices (7, 8, and 9) on one side of the sheet and two -helices (6 and 10) on the other side (Figure 3(c)). This folding topology of an -- three-layer sandwich belongs to the flavodoxin family.22 The seven-turn, Cterminal -helix (11) protrudes from this core and contacts the six-turn helix 4 in the SAICARs domain in a parallel coiled manner. Superposition of the AIRc domain with EcPurE (PDB file 1D7A, 26.6% sequence identity) indicated that their folds are highly conserved with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.5 Å for 146 C atom pairs. Octamer and intersubunit interactions Our study revealed for the first time that human PAICS exists as an octamer in both solution and the crystal, demonstrating the octameric nature of this bifunctional enzyme. A dynamic light-scattering (DLS) analysis on human PAICS showed that in solution the recombinant protein apparently forms an octamer with a hydrodynamic radius of 7.55 nm

wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing method and refined to 2.8 Å resolution (Table 1). The structure of this 425-residue peptide contains two distinct domains, the N-terminal SAICARs and Cterminal AIRc domains, which are linked by a sixresidue segment (residues Lys261­Cys266) (Figures 2(a) and 3(a)). Several regions of the polypeptide chain, including residues Met1­Val6, Asp37­Glu51, and Asp221­Thr238, were not visible in the electron density map and assumed being disordered in the crystal. The SAICARs domain can be further divided into two subdomains, designated as small subdomain (S subdomain, Leu7­Gln90) and large subdomain (L subdomain, Cys91­Leu260), with a long cleft between them (Figure 4(a)). Both subdomains S and L have an  +  folding each with a core composed of an antiparallel, right-hand twisted -sheet flanked by helices. The -strand order in the S subdomain -sheet is 1-2-4-3, and in the L subdomain the order is 8-7-5-6-11-12-1314 (Figures 3(b) and 4(a)). In the L subdomain, an additional short -hairpin (i.e. 9, 10, and the segment in between) consists of residues Phe150­ Ile157. Two loops, termed as A and B, are located

The amino-terminal SAICARs domain is colored orange, the carboxy-terminal AIRc domain is blue, and the linker peptide is green. The amino and carboxyl terminus of the peptide chain are labeled N and C, respectively. (b) A diagram of the octamer assembly. Four subunits in the front are shown in distinct solid colors, and four others in the back are in shaded colors. Each AIRc core domain is represented by a triangle, the C-terminal helix 11 is represented by a cylinder, and the SAICARs domain is represented by a polygon. For clarity, only the SAICARs domains on one side of the square AIRc octamer are shown, and the positions of SAICARs dimers are represented by cyan ellipses. The small circles represent the positions of AIRc active sites. The three major interfaces of the AIRc assembly are labeled I, II, and III. (c) Ribbon presentation of the overall structure of the PAICS octamer viewed along the 4-fold axis (top view) and a dyad axis (side-view) symmetry axes. Each subunit is presented in a different color. Positions of the AIRc and SAICARs active sites are circled. This Figure was drawn with the program PyMol [http://pymol.sourceforge.net/].

(±21%) with a molecular mass of 380 kDa. In addition, the result of gel-filtration chromatography during purification of the recombinant protein also supported the octameric character of human PAICS (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the finding that chicken PAICS may exist in solution as an octamer with a total molecular mass of more than 330 kDa.11 In our crystal structure, human PAICS forms a stable octamer composed of identical 47 kDa subunits. The octamer exhibits a 4-2-2 point group symmetry and an overall shape of two flowers integrated back-to-back with their tori composed of AIRc domains and petals made of SAICARs domains (Figure 2(b) and (c)). Of these observations, the information on AIRc­SAICARs and SAICARs­SAICARs interactions is novel. Similar to the class I PurE, 15­18 eight AIRc domains constitute a compact octamer structure that has a square shape if viewed along the 4-fold axis (Figure 2(b)). The long C-terminal helix (11) forms one edge of the square, and the linker between

the two domains and a sharp kink between helices 10 and 11 are located at the corner. An acute loop connecting 18 and 9 points to the center of the square. Each AIRc domain contacts four other AIRc domains directly (using a 3.6 Å cutoff). First, around the diagonal dyad axis of the square, the AIRc domain uses its 19 and 10 to form a dyadsymmetric interface (i.e. the interface I in Figure 2(b)), where 19 forms two intermolecular hydrogen bonds in an antiparallel manner and extends the existing -sheets. Second, around the bisection (nondiagonal) dyad axis of the square, the AIRc domain uses its L2, L3, 8, and 9 to form another interface (i.e. the interface II in Figure 2(b)). The remaining pair of interactions occurs between the C-terminal helix 11 of one monomer and strand 16 of a 4-fold symmetry-related AIRc monomer at the interface III in Figure 2(b). The total surface area buried by the creation of the AIRc octamer (excluding the SAICARs domains) is 3800 Å2 per monomer, which is approximately 40% of the AIRc domain surface,

The orientation is the same as in (a).

indicating considerable stability brought about by the formation of the octamer. About 60% of the intermolecular contacts in AIRc occur between subunits from the opposite square layer rather than between those in the same layer. The elaborate organization of the eight AIRc domains dictates the stability and nature of the octamer of human PAICS. For instance, the active site of AIRc domain is formed at the interface involving three subunits (see later discussion), indicating the necessity of octamer formation in its function. The SAICARs domains dimerize using the 2-7 connection loop and 3, and form four symmetric homodimers around the AIRc square. In an isolated dimer, the interface buries about 880 Å2 surface (i.e. 5% of the SAICARs domain surface) from each monomer, which would be marginally on the border of biologically relevant protein­protein interactions based on statistical analysis of the available crystal structures of protein homodimers.23­25 The SAICARs dimer, however, sits on the side of the AIRc octamer square (Figure 2(b)) and contacts the AIRc octamer with a 2200 Å2 interface (i.e. 10% of the dimer surface). In addition to the above-described intramolecular 4­11 interaction, the SAICARs­ AIRc interactions include those between the 2-7 connection loop and 4 of one SAICARs domain and 7 of the AIRc domain from a dyad-symmetrical subunit nearby, e.g. between the yellow and shaded green subunits in Figure 2(b). Together with the peptide connection between AIRc and SAICARs domains, this extensive contact ensures the anchoring of the SAICARs dimer onto the AIRc octamer. It

presumably makes the PAICS octamer more stable and may have important functional implications, for example, in tunnel formation (see later discussion). Active site of AIRc The carboxylase active site of PAICS is located on the AIRc octamer surface (Figure 2(c)) near the bisection line of the square (i.e. the interface II in Figure 2(b)). Similar to class I PurE,15­18 the positively charged active-site cleft including the substrate-binding pocket of AIRc is located at a threesubunit interface (Figure 5(b) and (c)). In human AIRc, the loops L1 (residues Met272­Ser274), L2 (Thr300­Lys304), and L3 (Gly330­Asn333) from one subunit and the L4 loop (Ser365­Leu372) from a dyad symmetry-related subunit form three of the four sides of the active site. These four loops are equivalent to the P-, 40 s, 70 s, and 100 s loops in EcPurE,16 respectively, though unrelated to the P-loop of the SAICARs. The remaining side is provided by the 11 helix from a neighboring subunit related by the 4-fold symmetry to the first subunit. Suggested by the crystal structure of EcPurE­AIR complex (PDB file 1D7A),16 the imidazole group of the substrate AIR would be located in one mainly hydrophobic pocket (Figure 5(c) and (d)) defined by Gly273 from L1 loop, Ala302 and His303 from L2 loop, and Ala329, Gly330, Ser332, Gly334, and Leu335 from L3 loop, which are all absolutely conserved in bifunctional PAICS proteins (Figure 3(a)). Among these residues, only His303 and Ser332 are polar, implying their unusual roles in such a

The Fo­Fc difference electron density map, which was phased with the refined structure model excluding CO2, was contoured at 3.0  and is shown as a rose chickenwire model.

hydrophobic microenvironment. In the octamer, four active sites are located on each of the two square faces (Figure 2(b) and (c)), with a distance of about 38 Å between neighboring active sites on the same layer and 11 Å between those from opposite layers, measured between the C atoms of His303.

To date, the substrate CO2-binding site in AIRc is not known. It was once proposed that Lys304 in the L2 loop acts as the CO2 carrier, which could not be confirmed by subsequent experiments.12,16 However, distinct amino acid sequence profiles of the L3 loop are found between the two classes of PurE enzymes (Figure 5(e)), implying its possible role as a

1610 carrier of the substrate CO2, which is required only by AIRc. Furthermore, during refinement of the PAICS crystal structure, a distinct electron density was observed on the 2-fold axis near the L3 loop and underneath the AIR binding pocket and was interpreted as a CO2 molecule. In the L3 loop of PAICS, Ser332 and Asn333 from a pair of dyad symmetric subunits appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the putative CO2 using their side-chain hydroxyl groups and main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms, respectively (Figure 5(d)), consistent with a potential role of L3 loop in CO2 binding. In order to exclude the possibility of being a crystallography artifact, we reprocessed the experimental diffraction data using space group P1 and refined the crystal structure with eight PAICS molecules per asymmetric unit. The resulting electron density map showed peaks of similar shape and intensity at the same position. To further prove functions of these potential CO2 carrier residues and verify the importance of loops L2 and L3 in carboxylase activity, we performed functional complementation experiments testing the AIRc activity of PAICS variants in the TX209 (purK) strain of E. coli as described.26 The survival of this PurK knock-out strain of E. coli in the absence of adenine depends on the AIRc activity of exogenous PAICS. While expression of the wildtype (WT) human PAICS compensated the loss of PurK activity in the bacterial strain, the PAICS variants containing single-point mutations of substitution His303 to Tyr (H303Y) in L2, S332A, or G334A in L3 essentially eliminated the ability of the bacterial cell to survive, suggesting loss of the AIRc activity in the PAICS variant (Table 2). In contrast, S400A mutant in 11 maintained a WT-like activity in the complementation assay. The choice of H303Y mutation was made on the basis of a previous study on chicken PAICS;26 and the choice of S332A and G334A was based on our working hypothesis that these conserved residues are indispensable to the carboxylation. The complementation results support the notion that loops L3 have an important role in the catalysis, possibly by carrying CO2, and His303 on loop L2 is important for the carboxylation.

Substrate-binding sites of SAICARs Location of the HSAICARs active site was determined by comparison with the complex structure of EcSAICARs and substrates (PDB code 2GQS).21 There is a 1.5 Å r.m.s. deviation for 190 C atom pairs between the two proteins. Furthermore, SAICARs residues binding the substrates are highly conserved between the two species. According to the EcSAICARs structure, the substrates including ATP, Asp, and CAIR would lie along the inter-subdomain cleft of HSAICARs (Figure 4(b)), where the 13-14 connection loop and the 11 strand form the bottom of the cleft. The highly conserved residues Arg101, Ser107, and Arg215 in HSAICARs were postulated to be the CAIR-binding residues, because the corresponding residues Arg94, Ser100, and Arg199 in EcSAICARs bind CAIR through hydrogen bonds.21 Moreover, one hydrophobic pocket underneath the A loop is formed by conserved residues and is suggested to accommodate the purine group of ATP. The A loop is equivalent to the P loop in EcSAICARs and may serve as the phosphate-binding loop for ATP. Loops A and B form two lids to cover the cleft. Another lid may be constituted by the flexible yet conserved region of residues Lys36­Glu51 based on the results of structural comparison (Figure 4(b)). It was found that in the absence of substrate, this region in crystal structures of both HSAICARs and TmSAICARs20 are disordered, while in the presence of a substrate the corresponding region in EcSAICARs21 appears well-ordered. These structural features make this active site a relatively hermetic environment that may be necessary for the ATP-hydrolysis-driven enzymatic reaction. Tunnel system and putative intermediate channeling Elucidation of the quaternary structure provides new understanding of the coupled carboxylasesynthetase activity in PAICS. Intermediate channeling is often a characteristic process in multi-catalytic center enzymes for the direct transfer of metabolic intermediates from one catalytic site to the next without prior equilibration with the bulk solvent.27 In PAICS, such an intermediate channeling mechanism has not been proposed, partly because of the lack of 3D structural information. In our current PAICS structure, we found a complex tunnel system between the active sites of AIRc and SAICARs (Figure 6). The existence of this complex tunnel system suggests a mechanism of intermediate CAIR channeling. The tunnel, depicted as yellow dots in Figure 6(b), appears to be the most direct (70 Å) path between the CAIR-binding sites of the two sequential reaction centers. This tunnel is composed mainly of surfaces of PAICS subunits that are enclosed inside the octamer. For the convenience of description, we divided the tunnel into three components; namely, the AIRcalley, SAICAR-path and Hall, based on how they are

a Growth rate in medium without adenine divided by the growth rate in medium containing adenine (see Materials and Methods). b Empty pET22b without a target gene was used as a negative control. Its non-zero growth-rate is caused mainly by the residual nutrients during inoculation. PAICS variants with a relative growth rate close to 0.12 were considered to be non- functional.

The AIRc-alley and SAICAR-path are composed mainly of the residues from AIRc and SAICARs, respectively, while the Hall, which connects the other two tunnel components, is made of residues from both AIRc and SAICARs. As shown in Figure 6(b), the AIRc-alley has a bugle-like internal shape and opens widely to the Hall. This part of the tunnel is located mainly inside the AIRc octamer and is composed of three subunits: for example, in Figure 2(b), the yellow subunit contributes helices 4, 10, and 11, the green subunit contributes loop L2, and the shaded green subunit contributes helix 7 and the 8-18 connection loop. The second part of the tunnel, Hall, is located between the AIRc octamer and SAICARs dimer and has a dyad symmetry. It is composed of four subunits: for example, in Figure 2(b), the SAICARs dimer formed by the yellow and shaded red subunits contribute their helices 3, 4, strand 7, and the 2-7 connection loop, while the AIRc domains of the green and shaded green subunits contribute their 7 helices. The third tunnel component, the SAICARspath, is formed by 2, 3, 7, and 8 from the dyadsymmetric SAICARs dimer. Interestingly, it consists of a series of residues that are highly conserved among members of the bifunctional PAICS family, including Phe108, Lys110, Arg111, Asn112, Lys125, Glu127, Gln139, Trp140, Ser141, and Gln144 (Figure 3(a)). Such unusual conservation at regions away from active sites suggests that the SAICARs-path is a common structural feature of the bifunctional PAICS family and may play a functional role in CAIR channeling between the sequential active sites. In contrast to human SAICARs, no tunnel was found in monofunctional EcSAICARs and TmSAICARs structures, although symmetric dimers were indeed observed in their crystal structures.20,21 In support of our hypothesis on PAICS tunneling, the entrance and exit of the tunnel are near the CAIR-binding sites of AIRc and SAICARs, respectively. Together with the partially enclosed environ-

ment of the SAICARs active site cleft and AIRc substrate-binding pocket, the tunnel might prevent the reaction intermediate from diffusing into the bulk solution. Enforced by the symmetry of the octamer, two AIRc-alleys from opposite layers of the central AIRc octamer join in the Hall (with a distance of 25 Å between the entrances from the two AIRcalleys) and share the common SAICARs-path (Figure 6(a) and (b)), forming a tunnel system of dyad symmetry. Furthermore, there are four such joined tunnel systems independent of each other in a PAICS octamer. Electrostatic-based channeling is a commonly proposed mechanism in intermediate transferring.27 Charge distribution in the PAICS octamer results in highly positively charged surface patches around the entrances and exit of the tunnel as well as the CAIR-binding sites, providing supportive evidence for the role of electrostatics in the CAIR transfer. Based on the PAICS structure, we propose that CAIR channeling in PAICS is achieved through an electrostatic-based mechanism that is similar to the channeling of reaction intermediates in the multienzyme proteins TS-DHFR28 and FT-CD.29 Residue Lys304 in human PAICS is located between the tunnel entrance and the CAIR-binding site, and is conserved among other PAICS proteins, implying a possible role of transferring the negatively charged CAIR into the tunnel by reducing diffusion to the bulk solvent. Along the tunnel, the intermediate CAIR could be transferred into its binding site in the SAICARs domain without geometric obstacles. The narrowest site of the tunnel is located at the AIRc alley with a diameter of 9 Å, which is wide enough for CAIR at correct orientation to traverse. Moreover, no positively charged residue is found in the AIRc-alley or Hall. Such a positive charge-free environment could be helpful for negatively charged CAIR to pass through the tunnel without retention from electrostatic attraction. In addition, two conserved basic residues, Lys110 and Arg111,

1612 are located between the tunnel exit and CAIRbinding site of SAICARs, implying one possible role, similar to residue Lys304, of transferring the intermediate into its binding site in SAICARs. Since each of the four tunnel systems connects two AIRc active sites and two SAICARs active sites, it potentially provides mechanisms to mutually regulate each other. For example, accumulation of CAIR either by overproduction at one AIRc site or saturation of the SAICARs sites could inhibit both AIRc active centers. Although two tunnel pathways share the same Hall and SAICARs-path, the flow of CAIR may be regulated to favor subsequent reaction. As shown in Figure 6(c), two clusters of conserved acidic residues, Glu142, Glu143, and Asp163, distribute symmetrically on the opposite walls of the SAICARs-path. It is possible that the resulting electrostatic potential shapes two tracks for the trafficking of negatively charged CAIR molecules in the plane bisecting the two acidic residue clusters (Figure 6(c)). Each of these proposed tracks is composed of conserved residues including positively charged Lys125 and leads directly to the conserved basic residues (Lys110 and Arg111) at the exit of the tunnel. In this electrostatic-featured channeling, the negatively charged phosphate group of CAIR would be an essential factor for the transportation. Until now, no study has been reported about the CAIR channeling in the bifunctional PAICS. Here, we present strong structural proof for the intermediate CAIR channeling in the octameric PAICS, although the channeling details for using the tunnel system, particularly its regulation, remain to be confirmed. As described above, each of the four independent tunnel-networks involves multiple subunits. It contains two entrances and one major exit. There are four entrances on each side of the central AIRc octamer plane (total of eight), one for each independent tunnel network; and there are four main exits, one at the tip of each SAICARs dimer, which potentially supplies substrates to two nearby SAICARs active sites.

Structure of Human PAICS

PAICS activity. The long, well-structured tunnel system may provide variety of small moleculebinding sites to disrupt the CAIR trafficking between the two sequential active sites. More importantly, the substrates of the two sequential reactions, AIR and CAIR, are significantly different from their final product IMP, implying that their analog inhibitors might have less toxic side-effects on the salvage pathway of purine biosynthesis, which is essential for normal cells. The novel architecture and unique assembly mode of human PAICS have enriched our knowledge on structure and function of multi-center enzymes and would stimulate further biochemical and structural studies on the PAICS family and related enzyme complexes. It is anticipated that this study will accelerate the development of anti-cancer reagents targeting to PAICS.

Materials and Methods
Protein preparation and crystallization The human PAICS cDNA (GenBank ID 30582814) was obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Hematology at the Rui-Jin Hospital of Shanghai Second Medical University. The PAICS gene was subcloned into the pET22-b(+) vector (Novagen) between the NdeI and XhoI sites. The plasmid was transfected into a methionine auxotrophic strain, E. coli B834 (DE3) (Novagen), and cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal medium supplemented with 60 mg/l of Se-Met (Acros). After the cell culture reached an A600 nm of 0.8, protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C overnight. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4000g and 4 °C for 30 min. Recombinant protein of PAICS was purified to homogeneity in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 200 mM imidazole and 0.2% Chaps by His-tag affinity (Qiagen) and preparation grade Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography and was concentrated to about 15 mg ml-1 in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT. PAICS was crystallized at 18 °C using the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method with a reservoir solution of 1.0 M succinic acid (pH 7.0), 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500. All protein purification steps and crystallization setup were performed at 4 °C, which appeared important for obtaining better-quality crystals. Log-shaped crystals of 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.4 mm size appeared in 48 h. X-ray diffraction data collection, phasing, and refinement X-ray data were collected on beamline BL5A at the Photon Factory in Tsukuba, Japan, with a 3 s exposure and 1° oscillation per frame. A MAD data set was collected at 100 K using 0.9780 Å, 0.9796 Å, and 0.9643 Å radiations at peak, inflection, and remote positions of selenium absorption, respectively. Data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 software package.30 Six of the seven possible Se-Met sites were identified and refined using SOLVE,31 resulting a mean figure of merit of 0.45 and a Z-score of 22.0. Density modification and

Conclusion
Insights into the functions and complex quaternary structure of PAICS have emerged from our study. In total, eight AIRc and eight SAICARs active sites are observed in the PAICS octamer, connected by tunnel systems. Both types of the active sites in the bifunctional enzyme in addition to the octamerization interface may become a potential drug target to manipulate specifically the activity of the complex enzyme. Because of the unique role of de novo purine biosynthesis in cancer growth, such PAICS inhibitors would be attractive candidates to be developed into anti-cancer drugs. The requirement of residues His303 and Ser332 in the substrate-binding pocket strongly supports this target selection strategy. Alternatively, the interruption of the intermediate CAIR channeling may also reduce or abolish the

The remainder of the protein model was built manually using the program O.32 The model was refined against the experimental "peak" data up to 2.8 Å resolution using the CNS software package.33 The final model, with R work = 24.1% and Rfree = 28.7%, was verified using the program PROCHECK,34 and shown to have a good stereochemistry. The buried molecular surface was calculated with CNS and a 1.4 Å probe radius. Data collection, phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Dynamic light-scattering (DLS) analysis The DLS experiment was carried out on a DynaPro DLS instrument with a 781.8 nm wavelength laser (Protein Solutions). The PAICS sample at 15 mg ml-1 concentration in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT was centrifuged at 4 °C and 10,000g for 10 min. The DLS experiment was performed at 20 °C, and at least 20 measurements were taken, which gave reproducible results. Analysis of data was done using the software DYNAMICS (v.5.25.44) provided by Protein Solutions. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional complementation assays Point mutations were generated using PCR-based methods, and the identities of individual clones were verified by sequencing the entire target cDNA region. Cells of the E. coli strain TX209 (purK) were transfected with the pET22-b(+) plasmid containing the cDNA of the PAICS variant and were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. When an A600 nm of 1.2 was reached, 1 ml of culture was harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 4 min. Then, the cells were used to inoculate 40 ml of modified minimal medium26 in the presence and in the absence of adenine (50 g ml-1) and grown at 37 °C. The modified medium was the minimal medium supplemented with 0.1% acidhydrolyzed casein, 10 g ml-1 thiamin, and 10 mM potassium bicarbonate. Ten hours later, the A600 nm was recorded for the cell culture as a measurement of the enzyme activity of the recombinant PAICS variant. Protein Data Bank accession number Coordinates and experimental structure factors of the PAICS crystal structure have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with the code 2H31.
