INTRODUCTION Thermus thermophilus HB8, an extremely thermophilic bacterium, is a model organism in structural biology. The complete sequence of the genome has been determined (www.thermus.org), and the sequence information provided us with the presence of a large number of hypothetical proteins. The open reading frame of TTHA1809 from Thermus thermophilus HB8 was annotated as a proline iminopeptidase-related protein. Proline iminopeptidase (PIP) is a serine peptidase that catalyzes the removal of N-terminal proline from peptides with high specificity. The enzyme was reported for the first time by Sarid et al.,1 and several genes have been cloned.2­7 The crystal structure of proline iminopeptidase from Xanthomonas campestris revealed that the enzyme has an a/b-hydrolase fold and a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad.8 The a/b-hydrolase fold family is one of the largest families with a variety of catalytic functions and substrate specificities. Members in the family include proline iminopeptidase, acetylcholinesterase, proline oligopeptidase, haloalkane dehalogenase, haloperoxidase, epoxide hydrolase, and hydroxynitrile lyase.9 In this study, we report the crystal structure of the proline iminopeptidase-related protein TTHA1809 from Thermus thermophilus HB8, and compare the active site of the tricorn-interacting aminopeptidase F1, which is the best homolog found using the Dali program, with the corresponding region of TTHA1809.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The cording gene for TTHA1809 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the genomic DNA of Thermus thermophilus HB8 as the template. The PCR product was cloned into pET-11a (Novagen). The Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as the host for protein expression. The cells were suspended in 20 mM TrisHCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. The cell lysate was heated at 343 K for 10 min, and after centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Resource ISO column. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.5 to 0M ammonium sulfate. The fractions containing TTHA1809 protein were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a Resource Q column. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5M NaCl. The dialyzed protein was applied to a hydroxyapatite CHT5 column equilibrated with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and the flow-through fractions were collected. The protein was loaded onto a HiLoad

HKL2000.10 The crystal contained two monomers per asymmetric unit according to the Matthews coefficient.11 The structure of TTHA1809 was determined by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method. Five of the six expected Se atoms in the asymmetric unit were found using the program SOLVE.12 The program RESOLVE12 was used to improve phases. The initial model was built with ARP/wARP.13 The remainder were built manually with XtalView14 and refined with REFMAC5.15 The native structure was then determined by the molecular replacement program MOLREP.16 Then, simulated annealing and B-factor refinements were performed using CNS,17 and further refinements were performed using XtalView and Refmac5. The final model consisted of 564 amino acid residues, 6 glycerol molecules, and 413 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Residues 285­286 of molecule A and residues 281­286 of molecule B were not visible due to disorder. The quality of the final model was checked by PROCHECK.18 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The purified protein containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was concentrated to 15 mg/mL. Se-Met labeled protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli B834(DE3) and purified using the same steps as in the native protein. Crystallization was performed using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. Crystals of TTHA1809 (0.2 mm 3 0.15 mm 3 0.07 mm) were obtained in 2 days by mixing 1 lL of the protein solution and 1 lL of the reservoir solution containing 100 mM HEPES-Na (pH 7.2) and 0.85M potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate. Se-Met labeled crystals were obtained under the same conditions as the native protein crystals. Native and Se-Met labeled crystals were transferred to the reservoir solution containing 25% (v/v) glycerol as the cryoprotectant and flash-cooled at 100 K in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected in a nitrogen cryostream at the beamline BL41XU of SPring-8 and at the beamline NW12 of the Photon Factory Advanced Ring (PF-AR).

The TTHA1809 protein from Thermus thermophilus HB8 consists of 286 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 31,550. The crystal structure of the TTHA1809 protein was solved by the SAD method and ° refined with 20­2.2 A resolution diffraction data (Table I). The quality of the structure was assessed by Ramachandran plot, and no residue fell in the generously allowed and disallowed regions. TTHA1809 exists as a monomer with approximate ° dimensions of 40 3 45 3 55 A3 and contains the two domains shown in Figure 1(A). The large domain (core domain) is composed of the N-terminal residues 1­128 and the C-terminal residues 210­286, and shows an a/bhydrolase fold which consists of an eight-stranded mainly parallel b-sheet flanked on both sides by a-helices. The small domain (residues 1292209) contains five a-helices (a4(a8) and one 310-helix (h3). The two molecules of TTHA1809 in the asymmetric unit are quite similar, with ° a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.52 A (1­275 a C atoms). A structural similarity search using DALI19 showed that TTHA1809 resembles the following proteins: the tricorn-interacting aminopeptidase F1 (proline iminopeptidase) from Thermoplasma acidophilum (Z-score 5 24.8; ° PDB code 1MT3)20 with an RMSD of 2.8 A for 250 Ca, 2-hydroxyl-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase BphD from Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1 (Z-score 5 ° 24.8; PDB code 1C4X)21 with an RMSD of 2.9 A for 247 a C , chloroperoxidase A2 from Streptomyces aureofaciens (Z-score 5 24.1; PDB code 1BRT)22 with an RMSD of ° 2.6 A for 242 Ca, prolyl aminopeptidase from Serratia marcescens (Z-score 5 23.6; PDB code 1QTR)23 with an

triad in the active site. The superimposition between TTHA1809 and F1 revealed that the residue corresponding to the catalytic Ser105 in F1 is replaced by a Gly at TTHA1809 [Fig. 1(B)]. Asp229 and His255 of TTHA1809 were located at the same position as Asp244 and His271 of the catalytic triad of F1. His255 of TTHA1809 was located in a loop between the b8-strand and the a10-helix. The ND-1 atom of His255 was hydrogen-bonded to Asp229 in a loop located between the b7strand and the a9-helix, whereas the NE-2 atom of His255 formed a hydrogen bond with a water molecule because of the lack of catalytic Ser residue. Thus, TTHA1809 and F1 would have different functions. A BLAST search using TTHA1809 revealed the possibility of the existence of enzymes lacking a catalytic Ser residue in several microorganisms (Thermus thermophilus HB27, Deinococcus geothermalis DSM 11300, Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1, Dechloromonas aromatica RCB, and Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396), but their functions have not yet been revealed.
