Key words: structural genomics; YqhE; NADPH oxydoreductase; methylglyoxal detoxification; antibacterial target Introduction. The Structural and Genomics Information Laboratory is involved in a Structural and Functional Genomics program (BIGS; http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/ str_gen/) aiming at the discovery of new antibacterial targets among proteins that are ubiquitous in bacterial pathogens, exhibiting good sequence conservation, but whose precise biochemical or cellular functions remain unknown. Comprehensive bioinformatics and comparative genomics analyses were performed according to these criteria, resulting in the selection of 110 Escherichia coli candidate genes submitted to a structural genomics pipeline, the details of which have been previously described.1 Here we report the crystal structure of E. coli protein DkgA, product of the gene formerly referred to as yqhE (EcoGene accession number: EG13015). This 275-residue protein belongs to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family [Enzyme Commission (EC): 1.1.1.-]. AKRs constitute a group of diverse cytosolic, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H]-dependent oxidoreductases, that catalyze the reduction of a wide range of substrates, such as aldoses, aldehydes, steroids, or monosaccharides. The precise physiological role of most of these enzymes remains unknown, although they have been collectively associated with detoxification of a broad range of substrates,2 including the toxic metabolite methylglyoxal.3 The AKR family is represented in most living cells as monomeric ( / )8-barrel proteins about 300 amino acids in length, exhibiting a catalytic tetrad composed of a tyrosine, a lysine, an aspartate, and a histidine. Despite their common / -barrel fold, a conserved cofactor binding site, and the catalytic tetrad, members of the AKR family often exhibit little sequence similarity, in some cases sharing less than 10% identical residues. It has been proposed that the difference in substrate specificity exhibited by AKR family members is linked to the length and sequence of several highly variable loops in their threedimensional (3D) structures.4 The E. coli DkgA protein was previously shown to catalyze the reduction of 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid to 2-keto-L-gulonic acid, a key step in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid.5 Because of its industrial interest for the

production of vitamin C, the homologous enzyme (EC: 1.1.1.274) in Corynebacterium has been the target of detailed biochemical and structural studies.6 ­ 8 Subsequently, DkgA was also found to be capable of stereoselective -keto ester reductions on ethyl acetoacetate and other 2-substituted derivatives.9 The 3D structure of the E. coli DkgA protein presented here was solved at 2.16 Å resolution by molecular replacement with the structure of the Corynebacterium homolog sharing 51% identical residues. Using NADPH as a cofactor, the recombinant DkgA protein was found to be active against a wide range of substrates, including methylglyoxal. Materials and Methods. Cloning, expression and purification. The gene encoding DkgA was amplified from E. coli K12 genomic DNA and directional cloning was performed using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was inserted by homologous recombination in the pDEST17 expression plasmid in phase with a N-terminal His6-tag, under the control of a T7 promoter. After transformation into DH5 cells, the purified plasmids were used for the overexpression of the recombinant proteins using our soluble expression screening protocol previously described.1 The best result was obtained with E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Cells were grown on 2 yeast-tryptone (2YT) medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37°C and the pellet was resuspended in a 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl buffer, pH 8.0 (buffer A), containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% glycerol, before sonication. The cleared lysate was then applied to a 5 mL HiTrap Chelating Column (Pharmacia) charged with Ni2 and equilibrated with buffer A. After sample injection, the column

was washed at a flow rate of 1 mL.min 1 with 10 column volumes of buffer A, followed by 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 25 mM imidazole, and finally 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole. Elution was performed with a linear gradient from 50 ­500 mM imidazole over 8 column volumes. The eluates were collected and the presence and purity of the recombinant DkgA protein in the different fractions was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The fractions corresponding to the elution of recombinant protein with 150 ­200 mM imidazole were run on a desalting column (Hiprep 26/10, Pharmacia) and the recovered fractions contained at least 98% pure protein in 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) 20 mM, pH 8.0. The recombinant protein thus corresponds to the native protein with the N-terminal methionine replaced by an extended His-tag inherent to the use of the GATEWAY system (i.e., 21-residue-long tag: SYYHHHHHHLESTSLYKKAGL). The purified DkgA protein was characterized by mass spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and by N-terminal Edman sequencing. Isoelectric focusing using 3­10 pH gradient precast gels (Novex) revealed a band around isoelectric point (pI) 6.55. Dynamic light scattering using the Dynapro system (Protein Solution) indicated the final purified product to be monomeric in solution. Aliquots of the purified protein were stored at various temperatures (293 K, 277 K, and 193 K), and the protein stability was monitored over time. The protein was found highly instable both at 293 K and 277 K, with N-terminal cleavages occuring in 80% of the molecules within a week of storage. Crystallization, X-ray diffraction data collection and processing. The DkgA protein was concentrated to 11 mg.mL 1 in MOPS 20 mM, pH 8.0, using a centrifugal filter device (Ultrafree Biomax 10K, Millipore, Bedford MA). We added 1 mM betaine to the protein buffer to increase the protein stability over time. Protein precipitation experiments were carried out using a variety of precipitating agents [i.e., (NH4)2SO4, polyethylene glycol (PEG), NaCl, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), and ethanol] at different pHs (i.e., 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) to determine the optimal DkgA protein concentration to be used for crystallization experiments. The DkgA recombinant protein ( 10 mg/mL) was initially tested at 293 K against 480 different conditions corresponding to commercially available solution sets (CrystalScreen-Hampton Research, WizardsEmerald BioStructures) and in-house designed10 conditions based on the crystallization protocols previously reported for other AKRs. The screening for crystallization conditions was performed on 3 96-well crystallization plates (Greiner) loaded by an 8-needle dispensing robot (Tecan, WS 100/8 workstation modified for our needs), using one 1 L sitting drop per condition.1 The best crystals of DkgA were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by equilibrating 1 L of protein (10.2 mg.mL 1 in MOPS 20 mM, pH 8.0, 1 mM betaine) and 0.5 L of reservoir solution [sodium/potassium phosphate 2 M, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N -2-ethanesulfonic acid

Crystal diffraction was performed at 100 K on the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (Grenoble, France) ID14-EH4 beamline at a single wavelength. The images were collected on a Q4R Area Detection Systems Corporation (ADSC) charge-coupled device (CCD) detector and the diffraction data were indexed using MOSFLM and scaled with the SCALA11 software. The crystals belong to space group C2221 with cell dimensions of a 139.2, b 145.7, c 79.5, and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Statistics of the processed data are presented in Table 1(a). Structure determination. The structure of DkgA was solved by molecular replacement using the AMoRe software12 and the available 3D structure of Corynebacterium sp. 2.5-diketo-D-gluconate reductase [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 1A808) as a starting model. One unique solution with two molecules per asymmetric unit was found with an AMoRe correlation coefficient of 42.7% and a R-factor of 46.5% for a resolution range of 15­3.5 Å. Several rounds of model building were performed to fit the DkgA amino acid sequence on the AMoRe solution based on observation of the experimental 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density maps. The model was refined using CNS,13 including simulated annealing, positional, and B-factor refinement. Addition of solvent molecules and a final round of refinement resulted in a final Rwork 17.2% and Rfree 22.1%. The final model comprises residues A3 to G276 and G1 to G276 for the two molecules, respectively. According to PROCHECK,14 90.0% of the residues are in the core regions of the Ramachandran plot, 9.5% are in the additionally favorable regions, and 0.4% are in generously allowed regions. The difference density map exhibited two peaks near the cofactor binding site corresponding to two

phosphate ions. The quality of the model is summarized in Table 1(b). Enzyme Assays. The enzymatic activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 25°C by measuring the decrease in the absorption of NADPH at 340 nm. Multiple potential substrates were tested in parallel using 96-well plates. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.5 mM NAD(P)H and 5 mM of various substrates in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), to which 10 L of a 16 M enzyme solution was added for total volume of 160 L. Results and Discussion. Overall structure. As expected, the overall structure of E. coli DkgA is very similar to the structures of other members of the aldo-keto reductase family. Its fold is a typical ( / )8-barrel with a cylindrical core of 8 -strands surrounded by 8 -helices interrupted by two extra helices, H1 and H2, toward the C-terminal side of the molecule and a -hairpinlike structure at the N-terminal end of the molecule (Fig. 1). Although determined in absence of coenzyme, the E. coli DkgA structure is much closer [root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) 1.125 Å] to the holo form of the Corynebacterium DkgA (PDB ID: 1A80) than to the apo form (PDB ID: 1HW6) (RMSD 3.26 Å). NADPH was not present in the E. coli DkgA structure, but the electron density map revealed the presence of two phosphate molecules at the same position occupied by NADPH in the Corynebacterium holoenzyme structure. These phosphates might mimic the influence of NADPH in the transition between the apo and the holo conformation. The remaining differences between the structure of E. coli DkgA and the Corynebacterium 1A80 structure concern the conformations of the loop between 7 and H1 near the cofactor binding site and of the C-terminal loop, which is longer in the 1A80 structure. Substrate binding site. As in other AKRs, many aromatic residues are lining the binding pocket. These include Trp24, Tyr52, Trp79, Trp109, Trp187, and Phe274. DkgA also exhibits the conserved AKR catalytic tetrad Asp47,

Tyr52, Lys77, and His108, permitting the transfer of a hydride ion from NADPH to the substrate. The map brought out two molecules in the substrate binding site of one of the two DkgA molecules. These correspond to two glycerol molecules from the crystallization medium. As glycerol is the product of the reduction of glyceraldehyde, these two molecules are probably occupying the bona fide substrate location in the cavity. The comparison of prokaryotic and eukaryotic AKR structures shows that the main differences are concentrated around three loops surrounding the substrate cavity. As shown in the structural alignment (Fig. 2), these loops (between 4 and 4, 7 and H1, and the C-terminal loop) are shorter in the prokaryotic structures. These loops have been proposed to be responsible for the substrate specificity4 of the various AKRs. In the context of designing new antibiotics capable of specifically inhibiting the prokaryotic enzymes, one might take advantage of these differences in loop sizes. For instance, bulky inhibitory ligands might be designed to fit the prokaryotic binding sites. Such bulky ligands may not been able to penetrate the less accessible eukaryotic sites. Activity measurements. The E. coli DkgA enzyme exhibits a wide specificity consistent with the absence of long loops around the substrate binding pocket. As shown in Figure 3, it catalyzes the reduction of several substrates. As expected from previous studies,9 strong activity was observed with the -keto ester ethyl-2-methyl acetoacetate. Interestingly, the strongest activity was found with toxic metabolite methylglyoxal. The overexpression of YghZ, another AKR from E. coli, was previously shown to increase resistance to methylglyoxal toxicity.3 Given the low similarity (25% identical residues) of the YghZ and DkgA sequences, this result is consistent with the previous proposal that besides their role in specific metabolic pathways, enzymes from the AKR family also participate in the detoxification of a broad range of substrates.2 In contrast, DkgA was found to be inactive on the

following compounds: formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, Dglucose, D-xylose, D-erythrose, D-ribose, L-arabinose, -lactose, acetone, pyruvate, 5-keto-D-gluconic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid. The enzyme required NADPH as a cofactor and showed no activity with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). We determined the structure of the DkgA protein of proteobacteria E. coli. This structure is very similar to the holo form of DkgA homolog (51% identical in sequence) of evolutionary distant actinobacteria Corynebacterium. The sequences of DkgA homologs are well conserved across evolutionary distant bacteria, a property of proteins playing an important role in the metabolism. Yet, if DkgA has been associated with a variety of enzymatic activities,5,9 its bona fide cellular function remains unknown. Paradoxically, there are numerous genes belonging to the AKR family, both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and their spectrum of activity appears to overlap, at least when measured in vitro. The E. coli genome also contains a number of DkgA homologs. The smaller size of the loops surrounding the substratebinding site is the main feature distinguishing prokaryotic AKRs from their eukaryotic homologs. The more open configuration of the bacterial AKR active site may explain the broad range of specificity of the E. coli and Corynebacterium DkgA protein. It might also provide the structural basis to design wide-spectrum antibacterial drugs while preserving the function of mammalian (e.g., human) AKRs. Accession number. Crystallographic coordinates as well as structure factors of the E. coli DkgA structure have been deposited in the PDB under accession number 1MZR.
