Abstract Selenium was incorporated into an oligodeoxynucleotide in the form of 2'-methylseleno-uridine (USe). The X-ray crystal structure of the duplex [d(GCGTA)USed(ACGC)]2 was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) technique and refined to a resolution of 1.3 Å, demonstrating that selenium can selectively substitute oxygen in DNA and that the resulting compounds are chemically stable. Since derivatization at the 2'--position with selenium does not affect the preference of the sugar for the C3'-endo conformation, this strategy is suitable for incorporating selenium into RNA. The availability of selenium-containing nucleic acids for crystallographic phasing offers an attractive alternative to the commonly used halogenated pyrimidines. © 2002 Société française de biochimie et biologie moléculaire / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction Determination of protein crystal structures with the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) technique [1­3] has gained widespread popularity over the last few years. Selenomethionyl proteins now account for about two thirds of all new protein crystal structures phased by MAD [4]. MAD phasing can be accomplished without the need of a potentially time consuming search for heavy atom derivatives. With more X-ray synchrotron beamlines coming on line worldwide, collection of diffraction data at multiple wavelengths has become ever more routine. Selenium (K edge, 0.979 Å [5]) has proven to be a very effective anomalous scattering center for MAD experiments and can be readily introduced into recombinant proteins in the form of selenomethionine [6]. Selenium in place of sulfur leads to only minimal changes in geometry and hydrophobicity and

crystals of Se-labeled proteins exhibit a high degree of isomorphism with their wild type counterparts. By comparison, covalent derivatization of nucleic acids for subsequent crystallographic phasing is thus far limited to incorporation of 5-halogen-2'-deoxyuridine or 5-halogen-2'deoxycytidine. Bromine exhibits a 0.920 Å theoretical K edge and MAD phasing has been performed on brominecontaining DNA crystal structures (e.g. [7,8]). In addition, numerous DNA and RNA crystal structures were determined with multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR), using brominated fragments either alone or in combination with additional derivatives ([9­12] and numerous other examples). However, applications of either MAD or MIR with bromoderivatives are often not successful in practice. Disruptions or alterations of base-stacking and other structural perturbations caused by bromo-derivatization at the 5-position of pyrimidines may hamper crystallization efforts. In the majority of cases, halogen derivatives cannot be crystallized under native conditions. Moreover, derivative crystals sometimes do not diffract as well as the native ones. A further potential problem associated with halogen derivatives is that the modified

nucleotides are light sensitive. Thus, long-time exposure of halogenated oligonucleotides to X-ray or UV sources may cause decomposition [13]. Selenium and oxygen are in the same Family VIA in the periodic table, which allows for selective replacement of oxygen with selenium. The anomalous signals of bromine and selenium are comparable (Fig. 1), indicating that similar numbers of bromine and selenium atoms need to be incorporated into larger RNA or DNA molecules in order to successfully use MAD phasing. Incorporation of many bromine atoms with limited choice of positions may cause significant changes in the native structures and potential problems in crystallization. Thereby, the use of bromine derivatives is probably limited to oligonucleotides. Compared with bromine, selenium leaves more choices in terms of incorporation site. In principle, selenium can selectively replace nucleotide oxygen atoms in different chemical and geometrical environments, including the 2'-, 3'- and 5'ribose oxygens, the furanose oxygen, the non-bridging phosphate oxygens, or oxygens in the nucleobases. Many of these oxygen atoms are not involved in intramolecular or intermolecular contacts, and the space surrounding them may be sufficient to accommodate the larger selenium atom. Selenium has previously been incorporated into DNA in place of non-bridging [14­16] and bridging phosphate oxygen atoms [17]. The phosphoroselenoates in which one of the non-bridging phosphate oxygens is substituted by selenium were found to decompose to phosphate with a half-life of around 30 days [16]. As antisense compounds, phosphoroselenoates were less active than the corresponding phosphorothioates and they were also more toxic to cells. Although they may therefore not be useful as therapeutic agents, the slow loss of non-bridging selenium in phosphodiesters does not a priori rule out the use of the phosphoroselenoate modification for crystallographic phasing. To examine the feasibility of using selenium covalently incorporated into an oligonucleotide for phasing crystallo-

graphic diffraction data, we synthesized 2'-methylselenouridine (USe, Fig. 2) and produced a self-complementary decamer DNA oligonucleotide containing the modified building block via solid phase synthesis. A preliminary report of the synthesis of USe as well as the crystallization of the modified decamer duplex along with evidence for the presence of selenium in the crystal based on X-ray fluorescence spectra has been published earlier (Fig. 3) [18]. Here, we describe details of the synthesis, purification and crystallization of the selenium-modified DNA decamer GCGTAUSeACGC and provide details of the MAD structure determination and the structural consequences of selenium incorporation.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Oligonucleotide synthesis and purification The synthesis of the 2'-SeCH3 ribo U phosphoramidite was described previously (Fig. 4) [18]. All other oligonucleotide reagents and 3'-CE deoxyphosphoramidites were purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, Virginia). The DNA decamer GCGTAUSeACGC was synthesized on a 2-µmol scale on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 381A DNA synthesizer. Coupling times of 90 s and 10 min were used for 3'-CE deoxyphosphoramidites and the 2'-SeCH3 phosphoramidite, respectively, and the 5'-trityl group was retained following synthesis. All couplings were greater than 75% as judged by the trityl assay. Cleavage of the oligonucleotide from the solid support and deprotection was achieved using 28% NH4OH, 55 °C, for 8 h. Reverse phase (RP) HPLC analysis and purification were carried out on an Applied Biosystems Inc. chromatograph with a Hewlett-Packard Hypersil ODS-5 column (4.6 × 200). A 1% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.03 M triethylammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) was used with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The crude trityl-on oligo-

nucleotides were purified by RP HPLC, detritylated in 80% acetic acid for 30 min, and then purified again by RP HPLC. The GCGTAUACGC and GCGTAUMeOACGC (UMeO = 2'methoxy-U) oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified following standard protocols. 2.2. UV thermal denaturation studies Oligonucleotide solutions were prepared by dissolving each oligonucleotide in a buffer consisting of 90 mM

sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.0) to give a final concentration of 1 µM in duplex. Extinction coefficients were calculated using the nearest neighbor approximation [19]. It was assumed that the 2'-methylseleno and 2'-methoxy substitutions did not change the coefficients. The solutions were then heated to 85 °C for 15 min, cooled slowly to room temperature, and stored at 4 °C overnight before measurements were taken. Prior to the thermal run, samples were degassed by placing them in a speed-vac concentrator for 2 min. Denaturation

2.4. MAD data collection and crystal structure determination X-ray diffraction data to a maximum resolution of 1.3 Å were collected at 100 K on the 5-ID beamline of the Dupont­Northwestern­Dow Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) at the advanced photon source (APS), Argonne, Illinois. MAD data from the K edge of selenium were collected on a single 2'-methylseleno-modified crystal. High- and low-resolution data sets were collected separately. Before data collection, a fluorescence scan centered around the selenium K-edge was recorded in order to accurately tune the X-ray beam to the three wavelengths (Fig. 3), i.e. those at the inflection point (edge), the absorption maximum (peak), and ca. 460 eV above the peak wavelength (remote) (Table 2). The three wavelengths were alternated after each sweep of 45° in phi with a 1° oscillation. All data were integrated and merged using DENZO and SCALEPACK, respectively [22]. Selected statistics of the anomalous data collection are listed in Table 2. A summary of the magnitude of the anomalous effect based on the two selenium atoms per asymmetric unit as a function of data resolution is given in Table 3. The positions of the two selenium atoms per duplex were determined with CNS-solve [23]. Following refinement of the heavy atom parameters, experimental MAD phases were calculated with the same program. Solvent flattening and density modification significantly improved the initial map, revealing excellent density for all twenty nucleotides of the duplex (Fig. 5). The structural model of an A-form DNA duplex [24] was used to fit atom positions into the modified experimental electron density. Initial positional and isotropic B-factor refinements of the duplex were carried out with CNS [23], using inflection point data (Table 2) and setting aside 5% of the reflections as a test set to monitor the Rfree

curves were acquired at 260 nm at a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min, using a Varian CARY model 3E spectrophotometer fitted with a six-sample thermostated cell block and a temperature controller. The data were analyzed in accordance with the convention of Puglisi and Tinoco [20] (Table 1). 2.3. Crystallizations Crystals of the selenium-modified decamer duplex were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, using a commercially available sparse matrix screen (Hampton Research Inc., Laguna Niguel, CA) [21]. Crystals for data collection were obtained by mixing equal volumes of an aqueous DNA solution (2 mM) and a solution containing 40 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0), 12 mM sodium chloride, 80 mM potassium chloride, 12 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride and 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (solution 19, Nucleic Acid Mini Screen) and equilibrating the droplets over 1 ml of a 35% v/v 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol reservoir solution. Several other conditions also resulted in crystal growth. Crystals typically appeared within one week and belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell constants a = 24.56 Å; b = 43.97 Å; c = 45.34 Å and one duplex per asymmetric unit. The crystals were shock-frozen directly in the mother liquor for data collection.

[25]. Anisotropic B-factor refinement for all DNA atoms and selected solvent molecules was performed with SHELX-97 [26]. After an Rfree of 20.0% was reached, all reflections to 1.3 Å resolution were used in the final rounds of refinement. Fixed positions for hydrogen atoms based on the positions of heavier atoms were included in the refinement, resulting in an Rwork of 14.9%. Selected refinement parameters and root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations from standard geometry are listed in Table 4.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Covalent incorporation of selenium into oligonucleotides Nucleic acids for X-ray crystallographic studies are usually prepared by solid phase synthesis (DNA and RNA oligonucleotides) or in vitro transcription (RNAs > 35 nucleotides long), using nucleoside phosphoramidites and triphosphates, respectively. In our initial exploration of the suitability of selenium for determining crystal structures of nucleic acids via MAD, we focused on the synthesis of the selenium-labeled T and U phosphoramidite building blocks. As one selenium atom should enable phase determination for RNAs or DNAs of up to 30 nucleotides length and the frequency of a building block in a nucleotide sequence is high (25% average rate), selenium-labeled T and U building blocks should satisfy most of the needs of oligonucleotide derivatization. In principle, any oxygen of a given nucleotide building block (A, C, G, U or T), including the 2', 3', 4' and 5' ribose, nucleobase, and -phosphate non-bridging oxygens, may be

subject to selenium replacement. In some cases, selective substitution of a single oxygen atom by selenium in a nucleotide may not result in significant functional or structural perturbations. However, certain substitutions, particularly those affecting oxygens involved in inter-strand (i.e. Watson­Crick) or intra-strand hydrogen bonds (i.e. C2'­H2' (n)...O4' (n+1) [27]), may not be tolerated and modification of such centers is not advisable. We chose to introduce selenium at the 2'-position of the ribose sugar (Fig. 2). Modification of the 2'--position with a methylseleno moiety appeared compatible with solid phase synthesis and the 2'-substituent was expected to conform to the geometric boundaries of A-form DNA and RNA duplexes. An obvious limitation of this modification strategy is that the sugar pucker is being restricted to the C3'-endo region. Thus, structures of B-form DNAs are not amenable to derivatization; however, the 2'-methylseleno modification is suitable for derivatizing small- and medium-sized RNA molecules. The uridine phosphoramidite with selenium at the 2'position can be synthesized in five steps, starting from partially protected uridine [18] (Fig. 4). Displacement of the mesyl protection group at the 2'-position by the uracil exo-2-oxygen under basic conditions in a two-phase reaction system involving a phase transfer catalyst results in formation of anhydro-uridine in high yield. The 3'-TBDMS group is then removed by fluoride treatment, followed by nucleophilic substitution at the 2'-carbon with sodium methylselenide in THF to furnish the 2'-methylseleno nucleoside. The methyl group prevents oxidation of the selenium functionality. Finally, the selenium-labeled nucleoside is converted to the phosphoramidite building block by treating the former with 2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphoramidite (Fig. 4). Apart from extending the

coupling times for USe phosphoramidite, standard solid phase synthesis protocols were followed to synthesize the DNA decamer and other DNA and RNA oligonucleotides [18]. Compared with the yields of regular DNA and RNA couplings (typically > 98%), those observed for USe are somewhat lower. However, they are still in a range that permits good overall yields for a 15mer oligonucleotide. Moreover, incorporation of a single USe is sufficient for phasing diffraction data of oligonucleotide crystals. After deprotection of the 2'-selenium-modified oligonucleotide, ion exchange or reverse phase (RP) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be used for purification. The decamer GCGTAUSeACGC was purified twice by

RP­HPLC (trityl-on and -off), using a standard triethylammonium acetate buffer/acetonitrile eluent protocol. 3.2. Stability of oligodeoxynucleotides containing 2'methylseleno U UV melting experiments were conducted to examine the effect of incorporation of a single USe residue on the thermodynamic stability of the DNA decamer GCGTAUACGC. We measured the melting temperatures (Tm's) of the duplex [d(GCGTA)USed(ACGC)]2 along with those of the native duplex [d(GCGTAUACGC)]2 and a duplex [d(GCGTA)UMeOd(ACGC)]2, containing a single 2'methoxy-uridine (UMeO). The results are listed in Table 1. Incorporation of two USe residues has virtually no effect on the thermal stability of the decamer duplex relative to the all-DNA control. The Tm of [d(GCGTA)USed(ACGC)]2 is approximately half a degree higher than that of the all-DNA, but it is clearly less stable than the duplex featuring a single 2'-methoxy-uridine per strand. It is well known that 2'-methoxy substitution of DNA leads to increased stability of duplexes between modified DNAs and RNA relative to the parent DNA:RNA hybrids [28,29]. The increase in Tm amounts to about 1.5 °C per methoxy substitution, but the origins of this gain in stability are not completely understood. In addition, RNA duplexes are typically more stable thermodynamically than DNA duplexes of identical sequence [30]. Both substituents, 2'-OH and 2'-OMe conformationally preorganize the sugar for the C3'-endo type pucker. In addition, the 2'-hydroxyl

groups act as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, thus engaging in stable hydration motifs that laterally span the groove [31]. Therefore, the RNA minor groove is well hydrated. By comparison, the minor groove of 2'-O-methyl RNA (2'-methoxy DNA) is dry [32]. The methyl groups are directed into the groove (antiperiplanar orientation of the C3'­C2'­O2'­CH3 torsion) and are in van der Waals contact with the edges of base pairs [33]. Clearly, opposing effects appear to be at work in terms of hydration of (2'-OH) RNA and 2'-O-methyl RNA, both resulting in increased thermodynamic stability of the respective duplexes relative to DNA. 3.3. MAD structure determination In order to select optimal wavelengths for MAD data collection an X-ray fluorescence spectrum was recorded from a GCGTAUSeACGC crystal. In addition to the precise locations of peak and inflection point, the shape of the K edge X-ray spectrum has been used as an indicator of the electronic integrity of selenium sites in protein crystals [34]. Compared with the K edge X-ray spectrum of a protein crystal (see Fig. 3, inset) that of the USe-modified DNA crystal exhibits a somewhat broader peak and the maximum is shifted to higher energy (by about 5 eV, Fig. 3). The cause of these differences is unclear, but it is unlikely that partial oxidation of selenium or anisotropy of the Se K edge are involved. The particular shape and position of the K edge may be related to the electronic environment of the selenium atom (i.e. the gauche orientation to O4'). Clearly, as more selenium-modified nucleic acid crystals are being investigated and different incorporation sites are being explored, we may gain a better understanding of the relation between the chemical environment in DNA or RNA and peak shape. Datasets at three wavelengths to a maximum resolution of 1.3 Å were collected from a single crystal (Table 2). Comparison of the intensities of Friedel pairs reveals a striking effect of the two selenium atoms per crystallographic asymmetric unit (Table 3). The magnitude of the anomalous differences is undoubtedly due in part to the presence of one selenium atom per single-stranded DNA decamer. This is approximately comparable to a frequency of one Se-Met residue per 20 amino acids in a protein. However, when comparing the relative magnitudes of the anomalous difference, we need to bear in mind that the occupancies of selenium sites (we are not referring to crystallographic occupancy here) in the USe-modified DNA can be assumed to be 100% due to the covalent nature of the C2'­Se bond. On the contrary, replacement of methione by seleno-methionine during protein overexpression will typically not proceed with 100% efficiency. A further difference may be constituted by the flexibility of the Se-Met side chain and the 2'-methylseleno-modified sugar in proteins and double helical DNA, respectively. In most cases the sugar moiety of nucleotides in duplexes is well ordered.

Terminal residues and single stranded regions (i.e. bulges) may constitute exceptions. As expected, both 2'methylseleno substituents in the crystal structure of the modified decamer were ordered and all atoms were refined with (crystallographic) occupancies of 1.0. Initially, the locations of both selenium atoms were determined from anomalous difference density maps (Fig. 5), relying on all three data sets (peak, inflection point and reference). After refinement of the two Se sites, Fourier electron density maps were computed, revealing excellent density for the entire duplex (Fig. 5). A model based on an earlier atomic-resolution structure of the decamer [24] was fit into the density and served as the starting point of the refinement. Initial rounds of positional and temperature factor refinements as well as simulated annealing were carried out with the program CNS [23]. At a later stage, the CGLS-type constraint least squares refinement in the program SHELXL-97 [26] in combination with anisotropic temperature factor refinement for all DNA atoms as well as selected water molecules was carried out. No bond length and angle constraints were used for the C2'­Se and Se­CH3 bonds and the C2'­Se­CH3 angle, respectively. An example of the final (2Fo­Fc) Fourier sum electron density surrounding USe residues is depicted in Fig. 6. We also examined whether data collected at the peak wavelength alone would allow phasing of the DNA decamer structure (single-wavelength anomalous dispersion, SAD). Indeed, Fourier synthesis based on just these data revealed unambiguous density for the whole duplex. Thus, incorporation of selenium into nucleic acids and careful determination of the peak wavelength is sufficient for SAD phasing. 3.4. Structure of [d(GCGTA)USed(ACGC)]2 The structure of the USe-modified DNA duplex is isomorphous to that of the GCGTATMACGC decamer (TM = 2'-methoxy-3'-methylenephosphonate-thymidine) [24]. In [d(GCGTA)USed(ACGC)]2 the two selenium atoms are separated by 9.1 Å across the minor groove (Fig. 7). The A5pTM(USe)6:A15pTM(USe)16 base pair steps in the two duplexes exhibit virtually identical conformations, illustrating that Se-modification at the sugar 2'-position does not distort the A-form duplex geometry (Fig. 7). All sugars in the decamer duplex adopt C3'-endo pucker and the pseudorotation phase angles (P) for the 2'-modified sugars of residues USe6 and USe16 are 13° and 20°, respectively. Both, the 2'-methylseleno and the 2'-methoxy substituents adopt antiperiplanar orientation around the C2'­Se and C2'­O bonds, respectively. The C3'­C2'­Se­CH3 torsion angle for residue USe6 is ­175° (C3'­C2'­O­CH3 = ­171° for TM6 in the reference structure). The C3'­C2'­Se­CH3 torsion angle for residue USe16 is ­172° (C3'­C2'­O­CH3 = ­175° for TM16 in the reference structure). In residue USe6, the C2'­Se and Se­CH3 bond lengths measure 2.02 and 1.98 Å, respectively, and in residue USe16, these bond lengths are 2.00 and 2.03 Å,

respectively. By comparison, the C2'­O2' and O2'­CH3 bond lengths in the reference structure are shorter by approximately 0.6 Å (TM6: 1.37 and 1.43 Å, resp.; TM16: 1.43 and 1.43 Å resp.; Fig. 7). Selenium is more hydrophobic than oxygen or sulfur, but the higher hydrophobicity is of little consequence in terms of the number of water molecules surrounding the 2'methoxy and 2'-methylseleno substituents. In the GCGTATMACGC structure, both 2'-oxygens are engaged in a hydrogen bond to single waters. The hydrogen bond distances are 2.83 and 3.03 Å for O2' of TM6 and TM16, respectively. The selenium atom of residue USe6 is surrounded by three water molecules at distances of 2.63, 3.24 and 3.34 Å. However, the selenium of residue USe16 is not involved in interactions with solvent molecules. Thus, introduction of selenium at the sugar 2'-position does not appear to affect minor groove hydration to a significant extent. 3.5.

4. Conclusions and outlook Covalent incorporation of selenium into DNA and RNA oligonucleotides at the sugar 2'-position in combination with MAD or SAD opens up a new route to rapid determination of nucleic acid crystal structures and potentially of

structures of protein-nucleic acid complexes. The approach presented here excludes applications to nucleic acid fragments with a B-form duplex conformation. Moreover, longer nucleic acids that are not accessible to solid phase synthesis cannot be labeled with selenium using our current protocol. However, the possibility to derivatize oligonucle otides with selenium does add to the armamentarium of crystallographic phasing tools for solving new nucleic acid structures. Since preparation of heavy atom derivatives of nucleic acid crystals is often not successful, these tools are currently mostly limited to incorporation of 5-halogenated pyrimidines. A major advantage of a derivatization strategy using selenium compared to 5-bromo U (C) or 5-iodo U (C) is that selenium can be incorporated in place of oxygen at a variety of sites in nucleic acids, including base, sugar and phosphate group. We have recently incorporated selenium into an oligodeoxynucleotide in place of one of the non-bridging phosphate oxygens. The two resulting diastereoisomers (Se-RP and Se-SP) were separated by ion-exchange HPLC and crystals diffracting to atomic-resolution were grown for both. Phosphoroselenoates were reported to decompose with a half-life of 30 days [16]. However, the selfcomplementary oligonucleotides containing a single P­Se moiety per strand were stable in the crystallization droplets for months and subsequent structure determination using MAD or SAD revealed fully occupied Se sites and excellent experimental maps. The opportunity to incorporate selenium at different sites within the framework of nucleic acids greatly enhances the versatility of the Se-derivatization

The views are (A) roughly along the normal to the top base pair (top) and (B) rotated around the horizontal by 90°, into the minor groove. The 2'MeO­3'MP T (TM) residue is 2'-methoxy-3'-methylenephosphonate-thymidine.

approach. Not only can DNA and RNA oligonucleotides be readily modified, but phosphoroselenoates can also be synthesized for any nucleic acid analog as long as it features phosphates in its backbone. In a decamer, for example, nine phosphate groups are available for P­Se modification, potentially resulting in a total of 18 derivative strands after separation of all diastereoisomeric pairs. This modification strategy is sequence-independent and, while involving a considerable synthetic effort, will undoubtedly lead to at least one selenoated oligonucleotide for which crystals can be grown. Possible partial decomposition of the phosphoroselonates may not hamper the crystallographic phase determination as even a selenium site of 50% occupancy can be expected to provide a sufficient anomalous contribution. Finally, it may be possible to extend the selenium derivatization approach to longer RNAs or DNAs that are not accessible via solid phase synthesis. For RNA, incorpo ration of selenium can be achieved by enzymatic in vitro transcription using UTPs carrying selenium at the 5'position [35] or in place of the exocyclic 2-oxygen. In

addition, longer RNAs can also be prepared by ligation of a long fragment prepared by in vitro transcription and a shorter one containing selenium and prepared by solid phase synthesis.
