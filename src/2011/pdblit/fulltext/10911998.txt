Abstract: Based on the X-ray structures of the pp60 src (Src) SH2 domain complexed with two high affinity phosphopeptide ligands (Glu-Pro-Gln-pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Leu, and Ac-pTyr-Glu-L~-Hcy-NH2; Hcy = homocyclohexylalanine), we report herein the design and structure-activity relationships of a series of novel dipeptide ligands targeting the Src SH2 domain. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. Introduction:

Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an important role in the signal transduction pathways that regulate cellular growth, development, and differentiation,z The protein pp60 src (Src) may play a role in disregulated cell growth, as elevated activity of this PTK has been associated with certain cancers. 3 Three domains in the Src protein-SH3, SH2, and catalytic tyrosine kinase domain-are involved in cellular signal transduction pathways. These domains consist of approximately 60, 100, and 250 amino acids, respectively. The Src SH2 domain displays high affinity for phosphotyrosine (pTyr) containing proteins and prefers a -pTyr-Glu-Glu-lle~ sequence. 4.5 We and others have previously described the structure-activity relationships for a series of phosphorylated tripeptides, 4°'7 as exemplified by compounds 1-3 (Figure 1), and these results have impacted our studies reported herein. Also, X-ray structures of the Src SH2 domain have previously shown two well~lefined binding pockets for the pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile type phosphopeptide ligands. 4'~ Specifically, one pocket (P site) binds pTyr and the second (P+3 site) binds lie. Guided by the comparative structure-activity relationships of the tripeptides 1-3 and the 3-dimensional (3-D) structural information of the Src SH2-phosphopeptide complexes (i.e., G l u - P r o - G l n pTyr-Glu-Glu-lle-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Leus and Ac-pTyr-Glu-D--Hcy-NH29 ; Hcy = homocyclohexylalanine), we focused an effort on the structure-based design of novel dipeptides ligands for the Src SH2 domain.

The co-crystal structure of 1 with the Src SH2 domain shows the C-terminal carboxamide extends into solvent, which allows this carboxamide (Figure 2) to be removed to yield dipeptide ligands without compromising binding affinity. 'u° We have further examined this prototype peptidomimetic series by varying the P+I amino acid, the C-terminal hydrophobic ring, and by sidechain transposition (P+I Ca---)P+2 Na) to identify potent lead compounds.

Results and Discussion:
Modifications of The C-Terminal Hydrophobic Group
Based on the interactions observed in the X-ray structure of Src SH2 complexed with the pTyr-Glu-GluIle peptide s and Ac-pTyr-GIu-D-Hcy-NH2 9 (Figure 2), a series of analogs have been synthesized in an attempt to optimize interactions at the hydrophobic P+3 binding pocket (Table 1). Relative to the parent dipeptide 4, the naphthyl modified analog 5 was designed to provide increased hydrophobicity with the shallow P+3 pocket and to restrict rotational freedom of the aryl-alkyl sidechain. hydrophobic pocket, but do not extend into the pocket. Modeling suggests that these aryl groups cap the P+3 Reduction of 5 to provide the tetrahydronaphthalene

derivative 6 showed further increased potency (IC~0 = 3.2 laM) relative to compound 4. Similarly, replacement of the fused cyclohexyl ring of cornpound 6 by an ortho ethyl substituent (7), in an effort to mimic the branched alkyl chain of Ile which extends into the hydrophobic pocket, results in about two fold increased potency relative to the parent dipeptide 4. As a reference, compound 8 was essentially equipotent to 4 but illustrates the binding enhancing effects of the fused cyclohexyl ring or ortho ethyl substituent of compounds 6 and 7, respectively.

P+I Amino A c i d Substitution

In conjunction with modifying the hydrophobic interactions in the P+3 binding pocket to increase the binding affinity ofdipeptide 4, we explored amino acid replacements at the P+I position (Table 2). Specifically, we were interested in the replacement of the acidic Glu sidechain with an uncharged sidechain. The X-ray structures8'9 show that the C~ and C~ of the P+ 1 Glu side chain conform to the protein surface and reside over a small hydrophobic patch, while the carboxylate extends outward towards Lys-57. In an effort to interact with this small hydrophobic area, we substituted Glu with norvaline (Nvl), giving compound 9, which did not significantly effect potency. Truncating the P+I alkyl sidechain of 9 by one methylene unit, essentially replacing the --CO2H of Glu with a hydrogen atom to give the aminobutyric acid (Abu) analog 10 resulted in essentially identical binding affinity compound 4. When Ala was substituted for the P+I Glu (compound 11) only a slight decrease in affinity occurred. However, replacement of P+I Glu by Gly, to give compound 12, effected about a five fold decrease in activity which results from increased rotational freedom and decreased hydrophobic interactions. Val modified analog 13 (IC50 = -30 ~M). A branched amino acid at P+I was less tolerated than the parent as a three fold decrease in potency was observed with the P+I Finally, both P+I Tyr and pTyr modified analogs were tested (compounds 14 and 15, respectively), and the latter dipeptide was found to be about three fold more potent than the parent analog 4, thus supporting the preference for acidic residues in this position for possible electrostatic interaction with Lys-57 of Src SH2 domain.

P+I Sidechain Transposition

With our tripeptide analogs° we previously observed that N-methylation of the P+2 Nc~provided increased binding affinity. A similar trend was observed in the dipeptide ~° series as exemplified by N-methylation of dipeptide 11 to provide compound 16, which resulted in increased binding affinity by approximately three fold. Since that N-methylation at the C-terminal amide was advantageous, we explored the concept of sidechain transposition (i.e., P+I Cc~ ---) P+2 Nc0 of the Glu sidechain of compound 4 to its C-terminal amide NH (Table 3). This would result in the nitrogen being substituted by propionic acid. Molecular modeling H indicated that homologation of this group to butyric acid would allow better mimicry of the P+I Glu sidechain; as stated above, X-ray structure indicates that this group forms a weak ionic interaction with Lys 57. We chose to evaluate Gly, Ala, and Nvl as P+I replacements in this series (compounds 17-19, respectively). The Gly derivative 17 and the Ala derivative 18 were three- and two fold more potent, respectively, than the corresponding NH derivatives 12 and 11. This increase in affinity was similar to that observed for simple P+2 N-methylation (vide supra) and suggests the carboxyalkyl functionality in the transposed sidechain was not contributing to activity in the Ala series. Interestingly, the P+I Nvl derivative 19 was three fold more potent than the corresponding NH derivative 9, while analog 20 was five fold more potent than the parent compound 4. Finally, substitution of the phenyl moiety of analog 4 by a cyclohexyl ring provided dipeptide 21 which was essentially equipotent to the tripeptide lead 1. Table 3.

Conclusion:

We have examined several prototype peptidomimetics through C-terminal modifications, varying the P+ 1 sidechain and transposing the P+I sidechain to the adjacent P+2 Nec position. A series of dipeptides systematically modified to explore P+3 binding site interactions were advanced. Specific modifications of the C-

terminal hydrophobic functionality included aromatic substitution and the alkyl linkage chain length modification to validate molecular modeling studies based on X-ray crystallographic structures of Src SH2-phosphopeptide complexes. This structure-activity study was focused on the P+I---~P+3 pockets of Src SH2 domain, and it extends our discovery efforts to identify novel dipeptide ligands. Such information impacts our design of secondgeneration peptidomimetic and nonpeptide ligands to provide potent, specific, and metabolically-stable lead compounds to explore the effects of Src SH2 blockade in cellular signal transduction pathways.
