Pharmaceutical Discovery Division, Abbott Laboratories Abbott Park, IL 600646098, USA Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that causes high mortality and morbidity rates and has developed resistance to many antibiotics. The genome of S. pneumoniae has recently been completely sequenced revealing many genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function. We have found that the gene encoding one such conserved protein, SP14.3, is essential for growth of S. pneumonia. Since it is essential, SP14.3 represents a potential target for drug discovery. Here, we describe the three-dimensional solution structure of SP14.3 as determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure consists of two domains each with an a/b-fold. The N-terminal domain contains two a-helices and a three-stranded b-sheet, while the C-terminal domain is composed of one a-helix and a ®ve-stranded b-sheet. The N-terminal domain of the protein contains a highly negatively charged surface and resembles the fold of the N-terminal domain of Thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein S3. The C-terminal domain has a protein fold similar to human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Sm D3 and Haloarcula marismortui ribosomal protein L21E. The two domains of the protein tumble in solution overall as a whole with an overall molecular rotational correlation time (tm) of 12.9 ns at 25  C. The relative orientation of the two domains is not de®ned by the nuclear Overhauser effect data. Indeed, residual dipolar couplings and the structure calculations indicate that the relative orientation of the two domains is not rigidly oriented with respect to one another in solution.

ance to many antibiotics used for its treatment, including the b-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazoles, tetracyclins, and quinolones.1,2 Due to the development of antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae, there is great interest in developing new antibiotics that act on novel protein targets from this organism. Structural and functional genomics can play an important role in drug discovery.3,4 The essence of structural genomics is to use a protein's threedimensional structure to help determine the function of the protein.5 ± 9 Using a structural genomics approach, the functions for several previously uncharacterized proteins have been determined from the organism Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, including MTH150 (a nicotinamide mono# 2001 Academic Press

594 nucleotide adenylyltransferase), MTH129 (an orotidine 5H -monophosphate decarboxylase), and MTH152 (a ¯avin monophosphate-binding enzyme).10,11 Other examples in which protein functions have been inferred from their structures include the murine Tubby core domain that binds to DNA and regulates gene expression,12 adipocyte complement-related protein (ACRP30) which is related to tumor necrosis factor,13 Bacillus subtilis YabJ14 and Maf,15 Methanococcus jannaschii MJ057716 and MJ0226,17 and Escherichia coli YciH,18 HdeA,19 and yrdC.20 S. pneumoniae SP14.3 protein is one of the many structural genomics targets selected in a genomewide survey of the uncharacterized proteins from this organism. Thus, SP14.3 represents a potential novel therapeutic target for the development of new antibacterial agents. However, the structure and function of SP14.3 has not been reported, and its protein sequence is not closely related to any other proteins with known function. Protein sequences orthologous to SP14.3 have not been found in higher organisms. Although bacterial orthologues of SP14.3 share about 40-60 % sequence homology, the function and 3D structures of these proteins are also not known. SP14.3 orthologues include the ylxS gene of B. subtilis, the yhbC gene of E. coli, and the HI1282 gene of Haemophilus in¯uenzae. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria meningitides, Rickettsia prowazekii, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Borrelia burgdorferi also contain SP14.3 orthologues. This suggests that SP14.3 could represent a broad spectrum antibacterial target. Here, we demonstrate that SP14.3 is essential for growth of S. pneumonia and describe the three-dimensional structure of SP14.3 as determined by NMR. The structure of this protein was compared to previously determined structures of proteins to provide clues about its function.

tial for growth, the bacterial cell can tolerate insertion of the plasmid into the target gene and chloramphenicol-resistant transformants are observed. If the gene is essential for growth, disruption of the target gene by the plasmid insertion is not tolerated and chloramphenicol-resistant transformants are not observed. Transformations with the non-essential control comD-pEVP3 knockout construct yielded >6 Â 104 chloramphenicolresistant transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA in a standard 1 ml transformation reaction. Chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were never obtained in multiple experiments with the SP14.3-pEVP3 knockout construct. Thus, the gene encoding SP14.3 is deemed to be essential for growth of S. pneumoniae. Assignments The 15N/1H HSQC spectrum of the uniformly N-labeled S. pneumoniae SP14.3 is shown in Figure 1. The backbone 1HN, 13C, and 15N resonances and side-chain methyl resonances of SP14.3 were nearly completely assigned (99 %) from an analysis of several heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectra using a uniformly 15N, 13C, and 2Hlabeled protein with selectively protonated methyl groups of Val, Leu, and Ile (d1) residues.25 ± 27 1Ha resonances were assigned from an 15N-edited TOCSY spectrum using a uniformly 15N-labeled protein28 and an HCACO spectrum with a uniformly 15N and 13C-labeled protein.29 The other side-chain resonances of the protein were assigned from HCCH-TOCSY and NOESY spectra using a uniformly 15N and 13C-labeled sample.28,30

Structure determination The three-dimensional structure of SP14.3 was determined using a distance geometry/simulated annealing protocol31 with the CNX program (MSI Inc., San Diego) from a total of 2803 NMR-derived distance restraints and 186 torsional angle restraints. These structures were further re®ned by including 153 restraints derived from the analysis of one-bond 1HN-15N (1DNH) and 13Ca-13CO (1Dca-cH ) residual dipolar couplings.32 Initial values for the axial (DNH) and rhombic a (Dr) components of the alignment tensor were obtained from the powder pattern of the residual dipolar coupling histogram33 and optimized using a grid search over DNH and Dr to ®nd the values a that best satis®ed the lowest energy structures calculated with the NOE-derived distance restraints and torsional f and c angular restraints. A single alignment tensor could not be found from the grid search that reduced the residual errors between the calculated and experimental residual dipolar couplings (jDcalc À Dexpj) to within experimental error. A search using randomly generated orientations of the two domains through the linker also failed to produce a single alignment tensor. However, when the two domains of the protein are treated indivi-

Results and Discussion
Essentiality of the gene encoding SP14.3 in S. pneumoniae Insertion-duplication mutagenesis (IDM)21 ± 23 was used to assess the essentiality of the gene encoding SP14.3 in S. pneumoniae. IDM makes use of the highly ef®cient natural genetic transformation system of S. pneumoniae. The mutagenic plasmids were constructed in the E. coli plasmid pEVP3 which does not replicate in S. pneumoniae and contains a chloramphenicol resistance gene.23 The pEVP3 knockout constructs contained a 300 bp internal 5H -portion of the gene encoding SP14.3 or, as a control, a 300 bp internal 5H -portion of the non-essential competence gene comD.24 Since the plasmids cannot replicate in S. pneumoniae, chloramphenicol-resistant transformants arise only by homologous recombination with the chromosomal copy of the target gene. If a gene is not essen-

dually, a separate alignment tensor could be found for each domain that satis®ed all of its experimental residual dipolar couplings with jDcalc À Dexpj within experimental error (<1.0 Hz). The best ®tted alignment tensors for the two domains have signi®cantly different magnitude and orientation with

the axial (DNH) and rhombic (Dr) components of a À20 Hz and 0.30, respectively, for the C-terminal domain and À15 Hz and 0.30, respectively, for the N-terminal domain. Thus, the ®nal structures were calculated with separate alignment tensors for each domain.

The individual domains of the protein are well de®ned by the NMR data (Figure 2 and Table 1). The rmsd about the mean coordinate positions for residues 7-86 in the N-terminal domain is Ê 0.54(Æ0.08) A for the backbone atoms and Ê 1.01(Æ0.08) A for all heavy atoms (Figure 2(a) and Table 1). The C-terminal domain has an rmsd of Ê 0.29(Æ0.05) A for the backbone atoms and Ê 0.86(Æ0.06) A for all heavy atoms for the residues 91-161 (Figure 2(b) and Table 1). The better-de®ned C-terminal domain could be explained by the larger average number of experimental NOE restraints used in the structural calculations for the C-terminal domain (19 NOEs/residue) than the N-terminal domain (16 NOEs/residue). In addition, the long loop (residues 69-79) which contains three proline residues between the a2 helix and b3 strand in the N-terminal domain is slightly less well de®ned when compared to the rest of the structure (Figures 2(a) and 3). This also contributes to the increased rmsd in the N-terminal domain. The experimental residual dipolar couplings used in the structural calculations increased the precision of the calculated structures, and reduced the Ê Ê backbone rmsd by 0.16 A and 0.20 A for the N and C-terminal domains, respectively.

Description of structure The structure of SP14.3 consists of a threestranded b-sheet and two a-helices in the N-terminal domain and a ®ve-stranded antiparallel b-sheet with one a-helix in the C-terminal domain (Figure 3). The b-sheet in the N-terminal domain is fairly ¯at and packed on one side by two long a-helices. In contrast, the b-sheet in the C-terminal domain forms a twisted b-barrel-like fold which is closed by the short loop sequence between b7 and b8. The bottom of the b-barrel-like structure is packed by residues in the loop between b4 and b5, and the top is sealed by an a3-helix. There are two b-bulges at positions Val29-Asp30 and Leu126Ala127. The linker between the two domains is very short and only has three residues (residues 88-90). There are two cis-proline residues (Pro25 and Pro73) present in the SP14.3 structure as indicated by the strong HaiÀ1 À Hai NOEs in the NOESY spectra. The electrostatic potential on the molecular surface for the two domains of SP14.3 is very different (Figure 4). While the N-terminal domain is highly negatively charged, the C-terminal domain is overall slightly positively charged. Furthermore, the

distribution of the positive and negative charges on the C-terminal domain is not uniform. There are clusters of highly positively charged Arg and Lys residues located at the end of the C-terminal domain (Figure 4). Domain orientation Many sequential and medium-range NOEs were observed around the linker region between the two domains. However, no long-range NOEs between the other parts of the two domains could be identi®ed unambiguously. Therefore, the relative orientation of the two domains is not de®ned by the NOE restraints. To determine whether residual dipolar couplings could provide information on possible domaindomain interaction, residual dipolar couplings of SP14.3 were measured by orienting the protein with the negatively charged bacteriophage pf1.34 Bacteriophage pf1 can cause the alignment of protein in a charge-dependent manner.35 The degree of different charge distribution of the positively charged C-terminal domain versus the negatively charged N-terminal domain (Figure 4) could lead to a different alignment for the individual domains if the relative orientation of the two domains changes during the experiment. The much larger range of residual dipolar couplings observed for the C-terminal domain compared to the N-terminal domain (Figure 5) is consistent with the different alignment tensors for the two domains. Therefore, these results as well as the small residual errors (jDcalc À Dexpj) obtained for the residual dipolar couplings when the two domains were treated using separate alignment tensors indicate that the two domains are not rigidly oriented with respect to each other in solution. We also attempted to measure additional residual dipolar couplings using a phospholipid micelle medium36 to orient the protein. However, a stable liquid crystalline phase could not be

obtained for this protein, which prevented us from obtaining these measurements. The observation of different alignment tensors for a two-domain protein has also been reported for protein barley lectin.37 Backbone dynamics For most residues, the T1 values lie in the range of 0.86-1.00 second (Figure 6(a)) and T2 values ranged from 47 to 59 ms (Figure 6(b)). The average errors in the calculated T1 and T2 values were 1.3 and 1.1 %, respectively. The seven residues at the N terminus and four residues at the C terminus of the protein exhibit slow relaxation as evidenced by larger T2 values which increase toward the ends of the protein. The slightly longer 15N T2 relaxation times were observed for the residues 88-91 in the linker region and for the residues 23, 24, 51, 52, 72, and 139-141 in the loops in the N and C-terminal domains. The heteronuclear NOEs for most residues were determined to be in the range of 0.70 to 0.82 (Figure 6(c)), indicating that internal motions on the fast (picosecond) time-scale are restricted. Exceptions were found for the ®ve residues at the N terminus and two residues at the C terminus in which the heteronuclear NOEs were negative. In addition, NOEs for residues 6-8 and 161-162 at the termini, residues 88-90 in the linker, and residues 23, 24, 52, 72, 79, and 139-141 in the loops were all signi®cantly reduced. In particular, the linker (residues 88-90) exhibits a moderate ¯exibility with 15N heteronuclear NOEs of $0.58 (Figure 6(c)). This indicates that the short linker in SP14.3 behaves more like the short linker (four residues) of the two-domain protein of the amino-terminal fragment of u-PA38 than the extremely ¯exible long linker (26 residues) of the two-calcium-bindingdomain protein of calmodulin.39 The overall rotational correlation times (tm) were initially estimated from T1/T2 ratios of the residues in the well-de®ned region of the structure, and

It is noted that the following pairs of residues (44 and 45, 40 and 81, 24 and 143, 74 and 121, 38 and 146, 35 and 59) are severely overlapped in the 15N/1H HSQC spectra.

subsequently optimized to be 13.0(Æ0.5) ns and 12.8(Æ0.6) ns for the N and C-terminal domains, respectively, from the model-free analysis using a previously described approach.40,41 The small spread in the measured tm values as well as the independence of tm values on the orientation of the N-H bond vectors suggest that the motion of both domains of the protein is effectively isotropic. The tm values of the two domains were found to be insigni®cantly different, and the average tm value of 12.9 ns is consistent with the protein having a molecular mass of 18.2 kDa at 25  C. This result indicates that the two domains of the protein tumble in solution in the same manner on the nanosecond time-scale.

The similar rotational correlation times for the two domains of SP14.3 are not unexpected, since the two domains are connected by a short linker. Furthermore, many charged residues that line the domain interface, in particular, Arg91, Lys94, Lys105, Lys155 and Arg157 on the C-terminal domain and Glu27, Asp30, Glu32, Asp47, Glu50, and Glu83 on the N-terminal domain (Figure 4) may lead to charge-charge interactions that further reduce the relative motions of the two domains. However, due to the limited contacts, the two domains can adopt many relative orientations while tumbling in solution together on the nanosecond time-scale. This interpretation is consistent with both the relaxation data and the different alignment tensors of the two domains.

600 Function of SP14.3 SP14.3 is an essential protein required for bacterial survival and its protein sequence is not closely related to any other proteins with known functions. Therefore, elucidation of the possible functions of this protein could be an important step forward toward the development of this protein as an antibacterial target. From a 3D structural homology search,42 it is found that the N-terminal domain of SP14.3 has a fold that has been found in a number of proteins, including the C-terminal domain of GTP-binding protein ERA,43 the C-terminal domain of ®re¯y luciferase,44 and the C-terminal domain of GMP synthetase.45 The N-terminal domain of SP14.3 most closely resembles the fold of the N-terminal domain of Thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein Ê S346 (Figure 7) with an rmsd of 3.4 A for the supera imposition of 68 pairs of C atoms. Both proteins have a three-stranded b-sheet packed on one side by two long a-helices. However, SP14.3 contains a longer loop that connects a2 and b3 than the ribosomal protein S3. The N-terminal domain of T. thermophilus ribosomal protein S3 makes no contact with rRNA and instead interacts with the ribosomal proteins S10 and S14 in the 30 S ribosomal subunit crystal structure.46 These data suggest that the N-terminal domain of SP14.3 could function as a protein module that binds to other proteins, especially those that contain highly positively charged surfaces. The C-terminal domain of SP14.3 resembles human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) Sm D347 and Haloarcula marismortui ribosomal protein L21E48 (Figure 8). These three proteins all contain a ®ve-stranded antiparallel b-sheet that is twisted to form a b-barrel-like fold and an a-helix that caps on the top of the b-barrel-like structure. The overall folds of these proteins are remarkably Ê similar with an rmsd of 2.1 A for the superimposition of 61 (out of 69 residues) pairs of Ca atoms Ê between SP14.3 and snRNP Sm D3 and 2.5 A for the superimposition of 59 pairs of Ca atoms

between SP14.3 and H. marismortui ribosomal protein L21E. However, snRNP Sm D3 has longer b3 and b4 strands than SP14.3 and L21E, and L21E has a shorter a-helix than SP14.3 and snRNP Sm D3. Another slight difference is that L21E has a longer loop that connects b1 and b2 strands than the other two proteins. The extended b4 strand in snRNP Sm D3 is involved in hetero-oligomeric complexes with other snRNP Sm proteins in the formation of core snRNP particles for spliceosomal function.47 Earlier studies have shown that snRNP Sm D3 protein alone does not bind to RNA and that only when it forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with other Sm proteins, does the complex bind to RNA.49 Therefore, future studies could be directed to see whether SP14.3 binds to certain speci®c nucleic acid sequences and/or forms similar oligomeric complexes with other proteins for nucleic acid binding.

Conclusions
SP14.3 is demonstrated to be essential for cell growth. Its solution structure is composed of two domains. The N-terminal domain contains two ahelices and one three-stranded b-sheet, while the C-terminal domain consists of one a-helix and one ®ve-stranded b-sheet. The N-terminal domain of the protein displays a highly negatively charged surface and resembles the fold of the N-terminal domain of T. thermophilus ribosomal protein S3. The C-terminal domain of SP14.3 resembles the folds of human snRNP Sm D3 and H. marismortui ribosomal protein L21E. Modular organization is a common theme in structural biology of proteins. A number of biological activities could coexist in one protein molecule with each activity localized to a distinct structural domain. For example, initiation factor IF3 is composed of two domains of roughly equal size (90 residues) with the N-terminal domain serving as proof-reading the initiation complex and the C-terminal domain binding to ribosomal 30 S subunit.50 Ribosomal protein S3 also contains two

domains with the N-terminal domain interacting with other ribosomal proteins and the C-terminal domain binding to rRNA.46 The essential SP14.3 protein reported here is also composed of two domains. Based on structural homology to other proteins, the C-terminal domain of SP14.3 with highly clustered Arg and Lys residues may interact with a speci®c nucleic acid sequence, while the N-terminal domain with a highly negatively charged surface could be involved in proteinprotein interaction, in particular, with those proteins that display positively charged surfaces.

then added to a ®nal concentration of 0.2 % and 1 mM, respectively. Competence stimulating peptide (CSP1)53 was then added to 100 ng/ml. After incubation for 15 minutes at 37  C, 1 mg of plasmid DNA was added to 1 ml of culture. The transformation mixture was kept at 37  C for 90 minutes after which aliquots were plated onto agar plates composed of THB-YE with 3 mg/ml chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 37  C and examined for colonies after 24 and 48 hours. NMR sample preparation SP14.3 was cloned into a modi®ed pET15b vector with an N-terminal His tag and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Uniformly 15N and 15N,13C-labeled proteins were prepared for the NMR experiments by growing bacteria containing 15NH4Cl with or without [U-13C]glucose. A uniformly 15N,13C-labeled sample with selectively protonated methyl groups of Val, Leu, and Ile (d1) was also prepared by growing cells in 100 % 2H2O and by supplementing media with 50 mg/l [U-13C] a-ketobutyrate, 100 mg/l [U-13C]a-ketoisovalerate, 3 g/l [U-13C,2H]glucose, and 1 g/l 15NH4Cl.26,27,54 The labeled recombinant proteins were puri®ed by af®nity chromatography on a nickel-IDA column (Invitrogen). Puri®ed proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mM BisTris-HCl and 50 mM (NH4)2SO4 (pH 6.5). The N-terminal His tag was then cleaved with thrombin (Novagen), and the reaction mixture was passed through a nickel-IDA column (Invitrogen) to remove the cleaved His tag fragment as well as the uncleaved protein. PMSF (5 mM) was added to inhibit thrombin during the puri®cation. The cleaved protein was then concentrated to 1 mM for NMR studies in a buffer containing 50 mM BisTris-HCl and 50 mM (NH4)2SO4 (pH 6.5). When compared with the native protein sequence, the protein used for the NMR studies (after thrombin cleavage) contains three extra amino acid residues (Gly1, Ser2, and Gly3) at the N terminus and two extra residues (Leu163 and Glu164) at the C terminus. NMR spectroscopy and structure determination The NMR spectra were collected at 25  C on a Bruker DRX600 or DRX800 NMR spectrometer. The 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances of the backbone were assigned using triple resonance experiments (HNCA, HN(CO)CA,

Materials and Methods
Mutagenic plasmid construction and transformation of S. pneumoniae The gene encoding SP14.3 is de®ned by the nucleotide sequence from the position 414,533 to 415,008 of the preliminary genome sequence data released by The Institute of Genomic Research, (TIGR) on March 7, 2001. The TIGR sequence is missing a G residue following the position 414,674, which leads to premature translation termination. The additional G nucleotide results in a reading-frame shift leading to the full-length 159 codon open reading frame of the SP14.3 gene. Additionally, nucleotide substitutions occur at three positions (G414702A, T414711G, and T414786C), one of which (T414711G) results in a change in the predicted amino acid sequence (Ile 3 Met) at the native protein sequence position of 60. Mutagenic plasmids for insertion-duplication mutagenesis were constructed by cloning PCR products into E. coli plasmid pEVP3,23 which does not replicate in S. pneumoniae but carries a CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) marker that confers chloramphenicol resistance to either host. The oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify internal 300 bp 5H -portions of the SP14.3 gene or, as a control, the non-essential competence gene, comD.24 The primers also included XbaI and BglII restriction sites for cloning into the vector. Insertion-duplication mutagenesis21 ± 23 was performed by culturing S. pneumoniae strain CP125051 in Todd-Hewitt broth with 0.5 % yeast extract (THB-YE) at 37  C until the starting inoculum (A550 nm 0.004) reached A550 nm 0.020.03.52 Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and CaCl2 were

HN(CA)CB, HN(COCA)CB, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO)25 using the uniformly 15N, 13C, and 2H-labeled sample with selectively protonated methyl groups of Val, Leu, and Ile (d1) residues. The side-chain signals were assigned from 3D H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, C(CO)NHTOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, and 15N-edited TOCSY experiments.28 Residual dipolar couplings were measured for one-bond 1HN-15N (1DNH) and 13Ca-13CO (1Dca-cH )32 with the sample from backbone assignments in which 18 mg/ ml bacteriophage pf1 was added to align the protein.34,55,56, 15N relaxation parameters (T1, T2, and NOE) were collected and analyzed as previously described.40,41 Two duplicate data sets were collected for the three relaxation parameters which were used to calculate their average values and standard deviations. Structures of SP14.3 were generated using a distancegeometry/simulated annealing protocol31 with the CNX program (MSI Inc., San Diego). Structure calculations for SP14.3 employed a total of 2739 proton-proton distances derived from 3D 15N and 13C-resolved NOESY spectra30 collected with a mixing time of 80 ms. The NOE-derived distance restraints were given upper bounds of 2.7, 3.3, Ê 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 A based upon the measured NOE intensities. From an analysis of the amide exchange rates measured from a series of 1H/15N HSQC spectra recorded after the addition of 2H2O, 64 hydrogen bond restraints were obtained. In addition, 186 f and c angular restraints derived from an analysis of the CH , N, Ca, Ha, and Cb chemical shifts using the TALOS program57 were included in the structural calculations. Furthermore, 153 observed 1DNH and 1Dca-cH residual dipolar coupling restraints were included in the later stages of structural re®nement using the CNX program. Protein date bank accession number The coordinates for the SP14.3 structures have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the identi®er code 1IB8.
