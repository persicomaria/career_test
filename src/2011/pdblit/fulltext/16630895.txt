Role of RAP in the Biogenesis of Lipoprotein Receptors
Guojun Bu* and María Paz Marzolo

The LDL receptor gene family is composed of several endocytic receptors that share structural homology and function in cellular uptake of various ligands including lipoprotein particles. The complex structure of these lipoprotein receptors is highlighted by the presence of clusters of cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats. An important feature that is shared by all these receptors is the inhibition of ligand interaction by a 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP). Recent studies have shown that under physiological conditions RAP serves as a molecular chaperone to assist the folding of lipoprotein receptors and their safe passage through the secretory pathway. Several non-exclusive models have been proposed regarding the molecular mechanisms of RAP function as an antagonist for ligand interaction with the receptors and as a molecular chaperone within the early secretory pathway. Elucidation of these mechanisms may provide insights into how biogenesis of lipoprotein receptors can be regulated via the expression of RAP under physiological and pathological conditions.

Lipoprotein particles mediate the transport of lipophilic molecules in both the peripheral circulation system and within the central nervous system (CNS) to maintain lipid homeostasis. These particles are typically spherical complexes of lipids and apolipoproteins; the latter are recognized by cell surface lipoprotein receptors for cellular uptake. The prototypic lipoprotein receptor is the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which was identified by the pioneering work of

Brown and Goldstein as a receptor for cellular uptake of LDL particles (Goldstein et al. 1985). Various mutations of the LDLR cause a common metabolic disease termed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; see Brown and Goldstein 1986, Hobbs et al. 1990). Since the description of the LDLR, it was recognized that other lipoprotein receptors also exist. Indeed, within the past decade several new receptors have been discovered that share high structural homology with the LDLR. Most of these new receptors are multifunctional and bind and endocytose many structurally and functionally distinct ligands that include both lipoproteins, as well as various proteases, protease inhibitors, and proteinase-proteinase inhibitor complexes (Krieger and Herz 1994, Willnow 1999). Together with the LDLR, these receptors form the LDLR family, primarily owing to their structural homology as well as functional overlaps. In mammals, the LDLR family now includes, in order of their discovery, the LDLR itself, LDLR-related protein (LRP), gp330/megalin/LRP2 (which will be called megalin in this review), the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2)/LR8B, and LR11/ sorLA-1. All members are type 1 singletransmembrane receptors and contain clusters of cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats (also called complement-type repeats) and epidermal growth factor precursor-homology repeats in their extracellular regions. Each of the cysteinerich repeat consists of approximately 40 amino acids that include six cysteine residues, which form three pairs of disulfide bonds (Fass et al. 1997). Other common structural elements among these receptors include YWDT repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail that contains one or two copies of NPXY motif. The NPXY sequence within the LDLR has been shown to direct the receptors into coated pits for receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent studies have shown that these NPXY motifs also bind to cytosolic adaptor proteins such as FE65 and mammalian Disabled, which are likely to bridge intracellular signal transduction pathways (Trommsdorff et al. 1999, 1998). A schematic drawing of these receptors is shown in Figure 1. Ligands for these receptors that are involved in lipoprotein metabolism include apoE, apolipoproTCM Vol. 10, No. 4, 2000

tein B, apolipoprotein J, lipoprotein A, lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, and cubilin (Hussain et al. 1999). Among these ligands, apoE is the only ligand that is shown to bind to all these lipoprotein receptors. The complex structures of lipoprotein receptors indicate that biosynthesis of these receptors may require the assistance of molecular chaperones. Indeed, studies with LRP, megalin, and more recently the VLDLR, have shown that a receptorassociated protein (RAP) serves as a specialized chaperone to assist LDLR family members to fold correctly and then traffic safely within the early secretory pathway. In this review, we discuss both the function of RAP as a molecular chaperone, and the proposed mechanisms describing how RAP interacts with receptors. · RAP Is a Universal Antagonist for LDLR Family Members RAP was initially discovered as a protein that co-purifies with LRP from human placenta (Ashcom et al. 1990, Strickland et al. 1991). Human RAP, which is comprised of 323 amino acids, is the homolog of a previously identified mouse protein termed heparin-binding protein 44 (HBP-44) (Furukawa et al. 1990) and also of a rat protein that was identified in kidney as a component of the glycoprotein 330/44-kDa Heymann nephritis antigenic complex (Pietromonaco et al. 1990). In addition to a classical signal sequence that leads the translated RAP into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), RAP contains a carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide (HNEL) that is similar to the ER-retention consensus sequence (KDEL). RAP is expressed in all human tissues and cells examined to date, with the highest expression seen in the kidney and brain (Bu et al. 1994b, Zheng et al. 1994). To date, the most dramatic effect observed when RAP is bound to LRP is the inhibition of binding and/or uptake of all known LRP ligands (Bu et al. 1992, Herz et al. 1991, Moestrup and Gliemann 1991, Nykjaer et al. 1992, Orth et al. 1992, Williams et al. 1992). This ability of RAP distinguishes this protein from other LRP ligands, which seldom inhibit one another's binding and/or uptake. In addition to LRP, RAP also binds to other members of the LDLR gene family and inhibits ligand interactions. Studies have shown that RAP exhibits high-affinity

binding (KD 1­10 nM) for LRP (Iadonato et al. 1993), megalin (Kounnas et al. 1992), the VLDLR (Battey et al. 1994), apoER2/LR8B (Stockinger et al. 1998), and LR11/sorLA-1 (Jacobsen et al. 1996), 250 nM) for the but low affinity (KD LDLR (Medh et al. 1995). In addition to members of the LDLR family, three other receptors, lipolysis-stimulated receptor (Troussard et al. 1995), cubilin (Birn et al. 1997), and sortilin (Petersen et al. 1997, Tauris et al. 1998), have been shown to bind RAP. The mechanism of how RAP universally inhibits ligand binding and/or uptake by lipoprotein receptors is still not entirely clear. However, two models have been proposed, which are derived mostly from studies of RAP interaction with both full-length LRP and shorter regions of LRP containing various ligand-binding repeat clusters. Early studies using purified LRP suggested two distinct RAPbinding sites on each LRP molecule (Williams et al. 1992). However, binding studies by way of cell surface ligand saturation indicated that LRP contains approximately five to seven times as many high-affinity binding sites for RAP than tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA; see Iadonato et al. 1993). In addition, the use of truncated soluble minireceptors of LRP representing each of the putative ligand-binding domains and subdomains of LRP indicated that five independent RAP-binding sites were present on LRP; two on each of the second and fourth, and one on the third ligand-binding domain (Bu and Rennke 1996). Thus, each LRP molecule may contain multiple independent RAP-binding sites which share, or overlap, with individual binding sites for other ligands of LRP, allowing RAP to either competitively or sterically inhibit the binding of these LRP ligands. An alternative model for RAP inhibition of ligand binding, which has received more experimental support recently, suggests that upon binding to the receptors RAP induces a conformational change which precludes ligand binding (Horn et al. 1997, Neels et al. 1999). These two models of RAP inhibition of ligand binding to LRP are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, it is possible that a combination of conformational changes in LRP and sterical hindrance allows RAP to inhibit all ligand interactions with LRP. These potential mechanisms for the antagonist function of RAP are likely shared

by other members of the LDLR family, such as megalin (Orlando et al. 1997) and the VLDLR (Mikhailenko et al. 1999). The ability of RAP to universally inhibit ligand binding prompted the use of recombinant RAP as an antagonist in the study of LRP and other members of the LDL receptor family, including examination of in vivo functions of these receptors. For example, perfusion of recombinant RAP prolonged the plasma half-life of the LRP ligand t-PA in rats (Warshawsky et al. 1993a). In addition, adenoviral-directed transient overexpression of RAP in the liver of mice caused RAP accumulation in the plasma and resulted in the inhibition of LRP-mediated clearance of ligands by hepatic cells (Willnow et al. 1994). Combination of adenoviral-directed RAP expression and LDLR-knockout allows the differentiation of the systemic function mediated by the LDLR and LRP in lipoprotein metabolism (Willnow et al. 1994). Similarly, a recent study with adenoviral-directed overexpression of RAP has identified an extrahepatic mechanism for the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that is independent of the LDLR and LRP (van Vlijmen et al. 1999). Finally, RAP has been used recently to inhibit LRP function in long-term potentiation using hippocampal slices (Zhuo et al. 2000). Thus, the ability of RAP as a universal antagonist for LDLR family members provides a unique tool for the biological study of these lipoprotein receptors. This is particularly important for the study of the biology of certain lipoprotein receptors (e.g., LRP and megalin) in adult mice, since deletion of their genes is lethal during mouse development (Herz et al. 1992, Willnow et al. 1996b). · Role of RAP as a Molecular Chaperone for Lipoprotein Receptors The first intracellular localization of RAP was described by Orlando et al. (1992) when they examined the localization of megalin and RAP in kidney proximal tubules. Using immunofluorescent and immunoelectron microscopy, they noted that RAP localizes intracellularly within the ER. The intracellular distribution of RAP was later quantitatively defined with the use of colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy with human glioblastoma U87 cells, which express abundant RAP
TCM Vol. 10, No. 4, 2000

and LRP (Bu et al. 1994a). It was shown that RAP localized most copiously within the ER (70%) and early Golgi compartments (24%), with little found on the cell surface or in the endosomes. This distribution pattern of RAP is consistent with those of other ER-resident proteins. Molecular characterization of RAP indicated that the HNEL sequence at the carboxylterminus of RAP is both required and sufficient for its ER retention (Bu et al. 1995, 1997), which appears to be carried out by KDEL receptors/ERD2 proteins (Bu et al. 1997). Removal of this signal from RAP results in secretion and redistribution of RAP along the secretory pathway, similar to those of normally secreted proteins. Thus, RAP is an ER-resident protein with its carboxyl-terminal HNEL sequence serving as the ER retention signal. The observation that RAP is an ERresident protein suggests that the normal physiological function of RAP is intracellular. Two studies on the biosynthesis of Heymann nephritis antigenic complex demonstrated an association of the two component proteins, megalin and RAP, early in the biosynthetic pathway (Biemesderfer et al. 1993, Lundstrom et al. 1993). In addition, a direct interaction between RAP and LRP within intact cells was demonstrated in U87 cells using a cellpermeable chemical cross-linker (Bu et al. 1995). Pulse-chase analysis reveals that RAP-LRP association is transient early in the secretory pathway and coincides with the formation of high molecular weight RAP-LRP complexes and reduced ligand-binding activity for the receptor. Dissociation of RAP from LRP likely results from the lower pH encountered in the medial-Golgi compartment and correlates with an increase in LRP ligand-binding activity (Bu et al. 1995). The importance of this RAP­LRP interaction during LRP synthesis was supported in RAP-knockout mice in which a significant amount of LRP was retained as aggregates in the ER of hepatocytes (Willnow et al. 1995, 1996b). Such ERretention was postulated to be ligand induced and was abrogated by the coexpression of RAP (Willnow et al. 1996b). Without RAP, LRP may be subject to faster turnover due to abnormal aggregation resulting from premature interactions with its ligands and/or improper folding (see below). These results together provide direct evidence that RAP regulates LRP's ligand-binding activity

within the secretory pathway, and suggest a role for RAP in preventing premature interaction of LRP with its ligands during the receptor's trafficking. Similar chaperone/escort function of RAP is likely applied to other members of the LDLR family. A model depicting the function of RAP during the biogenesis of lipoprotein receptors within the early secretory pathway is shown in Figure 2. One of the predominant characterizing features of LDLR family members is the presence of multiple classes of cysteine-rich repeat motifs. The formation of correct disulfide bonds during receptor folding presents a challenging task for ER chaperones. Using anchor-free, soluble mini-receptors that represent each of the four putative ligand-binding domains of LRP (sLRP1, 2, 3, and 4, corresponding to the clusters with 2, 8, 10, and 11 ligand-binding repeats, see Figure 1), we found that, in the absence of co-expression with RAP, sLRP2, sLRP3, and sLRP4 were aggregated and were retained within the ER (Bu and Rennke 1996). These aggregates of the sLRPs resulted from the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds during synthesis, since they were reduced to monomers when analyzed under reducing conditions. When RAP cDNA was co-transfected with the sLRP cDNAs, each of the sLRPs folded correctly and was secreted, with little or no aggregate formation. These results suggest that interactions between RAP and LRP is important for proper folding of LRP, possibly by ensuring the formation of proper intradomain disulfide bonds and preventing misfolding by the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. In addition to soluble LRP minireceptors, the role of RAP as a folding chaperone has also been demonstrated with membrane-associated LRP minireceptors (mLRPs; see Obermoeller et al. 1998). In that study, it was also shown that the functions of RAP and Ca2 ions during LRP folding are independent. The important role of RAP in LRP biogenesis is supported by studies with RAP-knockout mice, in which functional LRP in the liver and brain was reduced by as much as 75%. Although initial observation of RAP-knockout mice indicated a normal phenotype (Willnow et al. 1995), a recent study has shown that these mice are cognitively impaired in Morris water maze tests compared to controls, and showed a significant decrease in the num-

151

RAP co-expression, folding and secretion of the LDLR is not (Sato et al. 1999). Such results are consistent with the observation that while processing of LRP and the VLDLR is variably impaired in RAP-knockout mice, the functional expression of the LDLR is unaffected (Willnow et al. 1995, 1996b). The lack of requirement of RAP co-expression in LDLR biogenesis coincides with the lower affinity of RAP binding to the LDLR compared with its binding to other receptors (Medh et al. 1995). It is possible that the folding process of the LDLR requires a separate chaperone that functions similarly to RAP. Alternatively, folding and biogenesis of the LDLR may only be facilitated by the co-expression of RAP under certain physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Finally, RAP may also play roles in the biogenesis of other proteins, since previous studies have identified several RAP-interacting proteins that do not belong to the LDLR family (Birn et al. 1997, Petersen et al. 1997, Tauris et al. 1998, Troussard et al. 1995). · Structural and Functional Domains of RAP Using truncated recombinant RAP, early studies showed that the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains of RAP can interact with LRP independently (Warshawsky et al. 1993b, 1994). Subsequently, an internal sequence triplication of RAP was noted when high-sequence homology was observed between the regions of RAP when it was divided into three approximately equal parts, namely residues 1­100, 101­200, and 300­323 (Bu et al. 1995, Warshawsky et al. 1995; see also Figure 3). This internal triplication of RAP may have evolved as the function of RAP expanded to a universal antagonist for all the ligand interaction with lipoprotein receptors. Studies by Ellgaard et al. (1997) have confirmed the presence of the three repeats within RAP, but proposed slightly different boundaries for these repeats (residues 18­112, 113­ 218, and 219­323). Recently, studies by Medved et al. (1999), using differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy, proposed four independently folded domains within RAP (residues 1­92, 93­163, 164­ 216, and 217­323), with domains 2 and 3 constituting the second repeat defined previously. When recombinant RAP fragTCM Vol. 10, No. 4, 2000

Figure 2. Schematic model depicting how RAP functions as a chaperone/escort protein for lipoprotein receptors. During the biosynthesis of the receptors, RAP associates with these receptors and initiates the formation of multi-molecular RAP-receptor complexes. Within these complexes, RAP assists in the proper folding of the receptors. During their subsequent trafficking, RAP remains associated with the receptors to prevents premature interactions of ligands with the receptors. Following their trafficking together to the medial-Golgi compartments, RAP dissociates from these receptors as a result of the low pH. The retrieval receptors shuttle RAP via "salvage vesicle" back to the ER where neutral pH unloads RAP from its retrieval receptor. The low pH within the medial-Golgi which facilitates RAP dissociation may also impede the binding of other ligands to the receptors within the terminal portions of the secretory pathway. This facilitates the coordinate secretion of ligands and delivery of ligand-free receptors to the cell surface for subsequent trafficking within the endocytic pathway.

ber of somatostatin-expressing neurons (Van Uden et al. 1999). This new study clearly suggests an important role for LRP, and/or other lipoprotein receptors which are also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) (Kim et al. 1996, Stockinger et al. 1998, Zheng et al. 1994), in neuronal development and functions (see also Gliemann 1998, Willnow 1999). It also demonstrates the importance of RAP for the competent expression of LRP. The role of RAP as a folding chaperone

for lipoprotein receptors has recently been extended to other members of LDLR family. For example, studies by Sato et al. (1999) have shown that co-expression of RAP facilitated the secretion of soluble VLDLR. Similarly, we found that proper folding and trafficking of both soluble and membrane-containing VLDLR is promoted by the co-expression of RAP (Savonen et al. 1999). Interestingly, while the folding process of soluble LRP and the VLDLR is apparently facilitated by

and tertiary structure prediction, is shown in Figure 3. Future studies on the threedimensional structure of RAP will undoubtedly provide valuable information as to how this unique chaperone interacts with its target receptors. · Acknowledgments We are grateful to Mark Wardell for his critical reading of and suggestions regarding the manuscript.

Figure 3. Proposed three-dimensional model for the structure of RAP. The model uses the NMR solution structure of repeat 1 (Nielsen et al. 1997) and information from the limited proteolysis data and secondary structure prediction (Rall et al. 1998). The potential interaction between repeat 1 and 2 to generate high-affinity LRP binding site is also illustrated (Medved et al. 1999, Rall et al. 1998).

ments representing each of the three repeats were tested for receptor interaction, each of the three repeats was found to bind independently to LRP (Bu et al. 1995, Bu and Rennke 1996), a finding consistent with the suggestion that each RAP molecule is capable of interacting with more than one LRP molecule simultaneously. Alternatively, RAP may use these multiple epitopes to bind different sites within a single LRP molecule. With the use of various RAP and LRP domain constructs (Bu and Rennke 1996), it has been shown that the carboxyl-terminal repeat of RAP possesses high affinity for each of the three ligand-binding domains on LRP, whereas the amino-terminal and the central repeats of RAP exhibit only low affinity for the second and the fourth ligand-binding domains of LRP, respectively. Studies by Warshawsky et al. (1995) have identified clusters of highly charged amino acid residues within RAP that are required for interaction with LRP. In addition, basic amino acid residues within the carboxyl-terminus

of RAP have been postulated to mediate RAP binding to heparin (Orlando and Farquhar 1994, Warshawsky et al. 1993b), although the physiological function of such interaction is not clear at present. Interestingly, Hiesberger et al. (1996) found that an antibody generated against RAP strongly cross-reacts with members of the LDL receptor family, suggesting that RAP and these receptors may share a common epitope. The NMR solution structure of the amino-terminal repeat of RAP revealed that this repeat of RAP consists mainly of three up-down-up antiparallel helices (residues 23­34, 39­65, 73­88) (Nielsen et al. 1997). In addition, after examining protease sensitivity and guanidine HCl denaturation properties of RAP and its fragments, Rall et al. (1998) have proposed a structural interaction between repeat 1 and repeat 2 of RAP. A similar interaction was also suggested by an independent study (Medved et al. 1999).

Mapping of the Cryptic Integrin-Binding Site in Osteopontin Suggests a New Mechanism by Which Thrombin Can Regulate Inflammation and Tissue Repair
Yasuyuki Yokasaki and Dean Sheppard*

The integrin 9 1 mediates neutrophil migration across several ligands that are enriched at sites of inflammation. In one of these ligands, the acidic phosphoprotein osteopontin, the 9 1 binding site is cryptic, but is revealed after thrombin cleavage. We have recently mapped the 9 1 binding site in osteopontin to the linear peptide sequence, SVVYGLR, immediately adjacent to the thrombin cleavage site. Interestingly, this site is also adjacent to a sequence (RGD) through which five other integrins bind to osteopontin. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which thrombin can modulate integrin signaling at sites of tissue injury. (Trends Cardiovasc Med 2000;10:155­159). © 2001, Elsevier Science Inc.
