ABSTRACT The solution structure and backbone dynamics of the recombinant potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The structure, determined on the basis of 497 NOE-derived distance constraints, is much better defined than the one reported in a previous NMR study, with an average pairwise backbone root-mean-square deviation of 0.5 Å for the well-defined region of the protein, residues 7­37. Many of the side-chains show now well-defined conformations, both in the hydrophobic core and on the surface of the protein. Overall, the solution structure of free PCI is similar to the one that it shows in the crystal of the complex with carboxypeptidase A. However, some local differences are observed in regions 15­21 and 27­29. In solution, the six N-terminal and the two C-terminal residues are rather flexible, as shown by 15N backbone relaxation measurements. The flexibility of the latter segment may have implications in the binding of the inhibitor by the enzyme. All the remaining residues in the protein are essentially rigid (S2 > 0.8) with the exception of two of them at the end of a short 3/10 helix. Despite the small size of the protein, a number of amide protons are protected from exchange with solvent deuterons. The slowest exchanging protons are those in a small two-strand -sheet. The unfolding free energies, as calculated from the exchange rates of these protons, are around 5 kcal/mol. Other protected amide protons are located in the segment 7­12, adjacent to the -sheet. Although these residues are not in an extended conformation in PCI, the equivalent residues in structurally homologous proteins form a third strand of the central -sheet. The amide protons in the 3/10 helix are only marginally protected, indicating that they exchange by a local unfolding mechanism, which is consistent with the increase in flexibility shown by some of its residues. Backbone alignment-based programs for folding recognition, as opposite to disulfide-bond alignments, reveal new proteins of unrelated sequence and function with a similar structure.

INTRODUCTION Carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) is a 39-amino acid protein naturally occurring in potatoes that can inhibit several carboxypeptidases, forming complexes with a Ki in the nanomolar range.1 The biological function of PCI is unclear, but it is probably involved in plant defense against fungal attack and phytophagus plagues. As a protease inhibitor, PCI may have biotechnological applications in processes such as peptide processing, defense mechanism, carcinogenesis, virus replication, and so forth. Some protease inhibitors have been found to be cancerpreventive agents because they can suppress radiationand chemical-induced malignant transformations.2­ 4 Recently, the interest in PCI has raised considerably because it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines as well as tumors transplanted in nude mice.5 These antitumor properties are probably due to an antagonist effect against the human epidermal growth factor (EGF).5 The NMR three-dimensional structure of PCI in aqueous solution6 and the crystal structure of its complex with carboxypeptidase A7,8 were obtained previously. At present, there is no X-ray structure of uncomplexed PCI. Because this protein was one of the first studied by two-dimensional NMR methods, its structure was obtained on the basis of a short set of NOEs, and with no stereoespecific assignments, so that it cannot be considered as a highresolution structure. In fact, the structures resulting from that study were not deposited in the PDB. We have undertaken the study of the structure and dynamics of this protein with updated NMR techniques. The goal is further facilitated because the protein could be

obtained in a recombinant form in E. coli,9,10 yielding homogeneous PCI samples. These homogeneous samples were not available in previous studies6 because PCI exists in the plant in multiple natural species of slightly different sequences, which could not be separated for the NMR study. In addition, overexpression of the protein was used to obtain uniformly 15N-labeled samples for relaxation studies. To date, few studies on the internal dynamics of small cysteine-rich proteins have been performed. In this article we report on the high-resolution structure of PCI and on the dynamics of this protein based on 15N backbone relaxation experiments and amide proton exchange. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Purification The construction of a synthetic gene for PCI, its expression in E. coli, and a procedure for purification of the recombinant PCI secreted into the culture medium were previously reported.9,10 For large-scale production of the labeled protein, fresh transformed cells were precultured in LB containing 0.1 mg/mL carbenicillin at 37°C; after 5 h, 0.5 mL of media was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and cells were resuspended in 25 mL of M9 media containing (15NH4)Cl as the only nitrogen source and 0.1 mg/mL carbenicillin. This second preculture was continued overnight, and the cells contained in 10 mL were used to inoculate 1 L of the same media. Induction of expression by adding IPTG to the minimal medium has a chemostatic effect, avoiding ulterior cell growth. For this reason, the expression was induced in late phase, OD(595) 1.0, allowing the maximum accumulation of active cells before induction. After collection, PCI was purified from supernatant as described.10 The 15N PCI labeling was almost homogeneous ( 99%) as deduced by mass spectrometry analysis. NMR Spectroscopy Protein samples for NMR experiments were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein in either H2O/D2O (9:1 ratio by volume) or in D2O at a concentration of 2 mM at pH 4.0. All experiments were conducted at 35°C. Sodium [3-trimethylsilyl 2,2,3,3-2H] propionate (TSP) was used as an internal reference for 1H chemical shifts. The 15N -values were indirectly referenced by multiplying the spectrometer frequency that corresponds to 0 ppm in the 1 H spectrum, assigned to internal TSP, 0.101329118.11 NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX-600 pulse spectrometer operating at 600 MHz for the proton. 2D homonuclear correlated spectroscopy (COSY),12 total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY),13 NOESY spectra14 were recorded for the nonlabeled protein and acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase incrementation mode. Mixing times of 100 ms and 200 ms were used for NOESY spectra. TOCSY spectra were recorded by using 80-ms MLEV 16 with z filter spin-lock sequence. 2D heteronuclear 1H-15N HSQC15 and 2D heteronuclear HSQC-TOCSY were recorded for the 15N-labeled sample and acquired by using the States-TPPI method.16 Water suppression was achieved either by selective pre-

saturation or by including a WATERGATE module17 in the original pulse sequences prior to acquisition. 2D acquisition data matrices were defined by 2018 512 points in t2 and t1, respectively. Data were processed by using the standard XWIN-NMR Bruker program on a Silicon Graphics computer. The 2D data matrix was multiplied by a square-sine-bell window function with the corresponding shift optimized for every spectrum and zero-filled to a 2K 1K complex matrix prior to Fourier transformation. Baseline correction was applied in both dimensions. The spectral analysis program XEASY18 was used for semiautomatic assignment of the NOESY crosspeaks. Quantitative evaluation of the NOESY cross-peak intensities was conducted automatically with the integration routines included in the package. JHN coupling constants were measured by quantitative analysis of the diagonal to cross-peak intensity ratio in a 15 N-edited 1HN-1H correlation experiment.19 Qualitative evaluation of the J coupling constants was conducted from DQF-COSY experiments in D2O. Amide Proton Exchange Lyophilized samples of 15N-labeled PCI were dissolved in 0.5 mL of D2O at pH 4.0, 35°C, to detect the maximum number of amide protons. Once transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube and shimming, a series of consecutive 2D heteronuclear 1H-15N HSQC experiments15 were acquired with increased delays for up to 3 days. The acquisition time for each 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, which were acquired with 2048 complex data points and 256 t1 increments with 8 scans per increment, was 45 min. The spectra were processed by using the BRUKER-UXNMR software working on a SGI workstation. Before Fourier transformation, a mild square sine-bell window function equal in all experiments was used. Polynomial baseline corrections were applied in both dimensions. The volume integrals of the cross-peaks were calculated by using the BRUKER software for each spectrum. Hydrogen exchange rates were determined by fitting the decay in cross-peak volumes versus time to the equation: I A exp( kex t) C, where I represents the volume of the cross-peak, A is the amplitude of the exchange curve, kex is the observed exchange rate, t is the time expressed in minutes, and C is a constant, which takes into account the residual nondeuterated water and the threshold setting used in the intensity calculations. Data were fitted by using the program Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck software) on a Macintosh computer. The full kinetics for the exchange reaction follows the Liderstrom-Lang scheme, according to: kop kint closed | open O exchanged, 0 ¡ kcl where the closed form represents the exchange-incompetent form of the protein, and the open form the exchangecompetent form of the protein. In the final step of the above reaction, exchange takes place from the opening form with an intrinsic constant, kint. For each amide proton, this constant was calculated according to reported equations

from model peptides.20 The other two constants, kop and kcl, are the rates of the opening and closing processes, respectively. Under our conditions, exchange occurs by the so-called EX2 limit, in which kex kint, and kex is given by 21: kex (kop/kcl)kint Kopkint, where Kop is the apparent equilibrium constant for the opening exchange-competent state. This Kop can be converted to apparent free energies by : Gapp RT ln(Kop) RT ln(kex/kint), where R is ex the gas constant and T the temperature (in K). It is important to note that this free energy is an apparent free energy, because its calculation relies on the values of kint of model peptides. Structure Calculation The intensities obtained from integration of NOESY cross-peaks at 100 and 200 ms were converted into upper distance bonds by using the program CALIBA.22 Scaling factors were chosen to reproduce the correct distance limits for proton pairs separated by fixed distances, such as H -H of aromatic rings, or H -methyl in valine residues. Cross-peaks that could not be integrated because of either partial overlap or close proximity to the residual water signal were qualitatively assigned as strong, medium, and weak, and assigned distance constraints of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Å, respectively. No constraints from hydrogen bonds were used in the structure calculations. Initial structures were calculated from the NMR-derived upper bounds by using the method implemented in the program DYANA.23 The best structures were used to solve for ambiguities in the cross-peak assignment. Thus, longrange and nonsequential NOE cross-peaks were assigned in several consecutive rounds of peak assignments and distance geometry calculations. Stereoespecific assignments were obtained by comparison of the NOE patterns of experimental results with those expected from the structures obtained in the final stages of the distance geometry calculations. For protons not stereoespecifically assigned, and methyl and aromatic protons, the usual pseudo-atom corrections were applied. The best structures in the last round of DYANA calculations were further refined by restrained molecular dynamics using the program GROMOS9624 with the computational protocols used in our laboratory for structure calculations.25­27 In addition to distance constraints, J-coupling constant restraints were used in these calculations. In JHN constants, for which accurate values could be measured, the experimental restraints were included by using a quadratic pseudoenergy function that penalizes the difference between the calculated and experimental value of the J-coupling constant. A force constant of 10 kJ/mol Hz was used, and the parameters for the Karplus equation were obtained from Pardi et al.28 In J constants, when the H could be stereospecifically assigned, loose dihedral angle constraints were used to drive the 1 angle to the corresponding conformer. The input constraints for the structure calculation and the atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (code: 1H20).

Determination of 15N Relaxation Parameters N relaxation parameters were obtained at 600 MHz in the same conditions than the previous experiments (pH 4.0 35°C). 1H-15N cross-peaks in processed 15N T1 and T2 and NOE experiments were integrated with the XWINNMR software. T1 measurements29 were conducted with seven different delays, ranging from 20 to 1280 ms. In the same fashion, transversal relaxation (T2) rates were measured by using nine delays, ranging from 15.6 to 468.6 ms. The exponential decay functions were fitted with several programs, giving in all cases very similar values. For estimation of errors in the relaxation rates, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted with a suite of macros and programs available from A. Palmer.30 Although these errors were larger than those obtained from the leastsquare fit, in many cases they were still too small. We decided to set the relative uncertainties for 1/T1 and 1/T2 to a more realistic value of 5%. With these larger error bars, we take into account other sources of systematic errors in the relaxation parameters, such as the variability in the 15N chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) value. A similar approach has been used by other authors in the analysis of 15 N relaxation data.31,32 An initial estimate of the overall rotational correlation time, m, was obtained from the ratio of the trimmed mean values of 1/T2 and 1/T1 and the program tmes. The programs ModelFree version 4.030 and Tensor version 233 were used to calculate dynamic parameters according to the "model-free" approach of Lipari-Szabo.34 Five different models were evaluated for each amide 1H-15N pair with the following fitted parameters for each model: (1) S2, (2) S2 and e, (3) S2 and Rex, (4) S2, e, and Rex, and (5) Sf 2, S2, and e. The N-H bond length was taken to be 1.02 Å, and a value of 160 ppm was used for the 15N. Data were fit by an isotropic diffusion model as well as by more complex anisotropic models. In the latter case, the average solution structure of PCI was used as anisotropic model. Analysis of the Structures The programs Procheck/NMR35 and MOLMOL36 were used in structure analysis, molecular graphic manipulations, and detection of possible hydrogen bonds. The criteria for hydrogen-bond formation were (a) protonacceptor distance lower than 2.0 Å and (b) the donor-protonacceptor angle lower than 35°. Structural comparison between PCI and other proteins in the PDB were conducted with the program DALI.37 RESULTS NMR Assignment H NMR assignment was performed by the standard sequence-specific method38 on the basis of homonuclear 2D spectra of the nonlabeled protein recorded in H2O and D2O at 35°C, pH 4.0. 15N assignments were conducted by using heteronuclear 2D spectra of the uniformly 15Nlabeled PCI obtained in H2O in the same conditions as that of the homonuclear spectra. Both 1H and 15N signals show an excellent chemical shift dispersion (see Figs. 1 and 2). Excluding the N-terminal residue and the three Pro

residues, all 35 backbone NH cross-peaks in the 1H-15NHSQC spectrum could be observed. In addition, all the expected side-chain NH2 cross-peaks (eight in total for two Asn and two Gln residues) were present and readily assigned to their corresponding spin system after sequential assignment. In addition, cross-peaks corresponding to the indole N H of Trp 22 and Trp 28 and the Arg side-chain N H (Arg 32) were identified. Spin systems were classified into different types, and they were sequentially connected throughout d N(i,i 1), dNN(i,i 1), and/or d N(i,i 1) NOEs observed in the 2D NOESY leading to stretches of residues matching unambiguously unique segments of the sequence. The sequential assignment paths of two segments are shown in Figure 1. The d (i,i 1) and/or d (i,i 1) NOEs between the three prolines and their corresponding preceding residues observed at the 2D NOESY spectra indicate that all prolines are in a trans conformation. Assignment of aromatic rings spin systems was based on homonuclear 2D COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra. Stereospecific assignments of H protons were performed on the basis of NOE intensities, 3J coupling constants, and their compatibility with the preliminary structure calculations. H protons of 15 of 28 residues could be stereoespecifically assigned (see Table SM1 in the

Supplementary Material). The chemical shifts assignments have been deposited at BioMagResBank (http:// www.bmrb.wisc.edu/).39 Most of the proton resonances are coincident with the previous assignments reported by Clore et al.6 However, some differences are observed in residues 1­ 4. This is probably due to the presence of minor PCI species of a shorter sequence in Clore's work. Structure Calculation The structure of PCI was calculated on the basis of 497 interprotonic distance constraints and 55 dihedral angle constraints derived from vicinal J-coupling constraints, following the procedure described in Materials and Methods. Table I summarizes the numbers of the structurally relevant intraresidual, sequential, and medium- and longrange constraints used for the calculation. With the exception of the six N-terminal and the two C-terminal residues, the ensemble of 25 final structures is very well defined. The average backbone RMSD between these 25 structures is 0.46 0.15 Å for the well-defined residues (7­37). This value goes down to 0.31 0.12 Å when the RMSD is calculated with respect to the average structure. In this well-defined region, only Ser 19 and Gly 20 present a

slightly higher local RMSD of around 1 Å (see Figs. 3 and 4). The extremely good convergence of the structures is due to the high number of constraints (around 17 distance

constraints per residue in the well-defined part) and the large amount of stereospecific assignments that could be accomplished.

Many side-chain conformations are also very well defined. The buried residues, forming the core of the protein, present an RMSD of 0.6 Å for all heavy atoms. In addition, many exposed side-chains adopt a relatively well-defined conformation (see Fig. 3). The residual distance and J-coupling violations are low in all the final structures, with no violation larger than 0.8 Å or 1.7 Hz. In addition, the structures show low values of the different energy terms, indicating that the geometry is consistent with the GROMOS force field. Residual violations and several energy terms are given in Table II. Almost all and angles are in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Distributions of these angles for the different residues are shown in Figure 5.

Backbone Dynamics
15 N relaxation parameters were obtained for 35 of the 39 residues (all except the N-terminal and the four prolines). R1, R2, and heteronuclear NOE values are shown in Figure 6. R1 and NOE values are relatively uniform along the sequence with the exception of Ser19 and the N- and Cterminal residues, where a pronounced decrease of the three relaxation parameters is observed. For most residues, the NOE ratio is not far from the value of 0.82, indicating that the backbone of this protein is essentially rigid all along its length. Lower NOE ratios (even of the reverse sign) are obtained for the N- and C-terminal residues. This is a clear indication that the high RMSD values shown in Figure 4 are due to real backbone flexibility. More variability is observed in the transversal relaxation times. R2 values for residues 7, 10, 18, 23, 28, and 35 are quite above the average value of 7.5. An estimation of the overall correlation time of 4.7 ns for this protein was obtained from the trimmed means of the R2 and R1 values. This is a somewhat larger value than the one to be expected on simple grounds for a molecule of this size. It may be that the flexible residues in the N- and C-terminus contribute to enlarge the overall correlation time. Other examples of protein with flexible regions exhibiting long correlation times have been reported recently.40,41 More measurements of relaxation times in small proteins are needed to find a definitive answer to this question. The relaxation parameters were analyzed by using a "model-free" approach as explained in Materials and Methods. The overall shape of PCI is like an oblate ellipsoid with relative inertia moments of 2:2:1. Accordingly, an anisotropic diffusion model was used in the fitting of the relaxation parameters. However, it must be pointed out that the improvement in the quality of the fitting of the anisotropic versus isotropic models was not considered significant in a Monte Carlo analysis conducted with the program Tensor2.33 In general, the model-free parameters obtained with both kinds of models are very similar, with fewer residues affected by exchange contributions when the anisotropic models are used. Such similarity has been observed in other proteins where the relaxation data have been fitted with anisotropic rotational diffusion models.42,43 In our case, the best fit is obtained with a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor of components Dxx 2.2 107 s 1, Dyy 3.9 107 s 1, Dzz 5.0 107 s 1. The angles between the principal components of the inertia and diffusion tensor are 40°, 9°, and 39°, respectively. About half of the 15N relaxation curves can be fitted with the simplest relaxation model, model I, where fast internal motions are neglected and the dynamics is described by a single-order parameter, S2. Five 15N atoms fit better to model II, where a rapid internal motion, characterized by an effective correlation time e, is included. In 12 other amide groups, the relaxation data were fitted by using a more complex model (IV) that includes rapid internal motions with exchange contributions. In one case (residue 35), the data were best fitted with model III, that considers an overall molecular motion with exchange contributions.

hydrogen bond pattern typical of 3/10 helices. Residues 26 ­28 and 33­35 form a very small -sheet made of two short antiparallel strands, with hydrogen bonds between residues 35­26 and 28 ­33. A third strand, residues 9 ­12, forms hydrogen bonds with the segment 32­34 (see Table III for a complete list), but these residues do not adopt an extended conformation and are not identified as part of the -sheet by MOLMOL. A number of turns are found along the backbone, three of them (5­ 8, 7­10, and 28 ­31) characterized by CO(i)-NH(i 3) backbone hydrogen bonds. Turn 7­10 is a canonical type II - turn, whereas the backbone angles for turns 5­ 8 and 28 ­31 are within the type III category. In addition to these hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms, listed in Table III, two side-chain hydrogen bonds are observed, one between HE1 of Trp 26 and O of Pro 6, and the other between one of the carboxylic oxygens of Asp 17 and the amino proton of Lys 13. In addition, an intraresidual hydrogen bond between the amide backbone proton of Gln 25 and one of its side-chain OE atoms is found in most of the structures. It is interesting that the amino acid sequence of PCI contains six aromatic residues, but none of them is involved in the hydrophobic core of the protein ( 30% of their accessible surface area is exposed to the solvent). With the exception of His 4, all these aromatic residues are located at the same side of the protein. In the X-ray structure of the complex between PCI and carboxypeptidase A, these residues form the contact surface between the two proteins. Despite being exposed to the solvent, all these side-chains adopt a well-defined conformation in the solution structure of the isolated PCI.

helix. With exception of residues 19 and 20, the various turns observed in the structure of PCI do not show a different dynamic behavior from the elements of secondary structure. A number of residues are affected by exchange contributions, arising from movements in the scale of s-ms. In other small cysteine-rich proteins, such exchange effects have been associated with isomerization of the disulfide bridges.44,45 In PCI, the residues affected by these exchange effects are spread along the sequence, with no apparent correlation with any of the disulfide bonds. Hydrogen Exchange Despite its small size, 18 protons of 38 exchange in PCI (Table IV) exchange slowly. All of them, except Ile 7 and Thr 33, are either buried or hydrogen bonded. According to their G, the residues can be classified in three groups (Fig. 8). The first group includes those residues with the largest G values ( 4.0 kcal mol 1), which happen to be located around the -sheet (Gln 25, Ala 26, Thr 33, Cys 34, and Gly 35). The fact that all these residues show a similar G value (the average calculated value is 5 kcal mol 1) suggests that they exchange by a concerted globalunfolding event. The second group (2.0 kcal mol 1 G 4.0 kcal mol 1) includes residues on segments close to the -sheet, such as Trp 28 and Arg 32, as well as some others in segment 7­12. These residues belong to a polypeptide patch in contact with the -sheet, with some of their NH protons hydrogen bonded to residues 32 and 34. Finally, the third group ( G 2.0 kcal mol 1) involves residues located in the loops around residues 13 and 14, and 21 and 22. The residues forming the 3/10 helix belong also to this class, which suggests that this element of secondary structure is not part of the most stable core of the protein against unfolding. In the calculation of the apparent free energies of unfolding from exchange data we have assumed that the aspartic and glutamic residues are in the carboxylate form at pH 4.0. The only residue of this kind with an NH that is not in the fastest region is Asp 17, which in the sequence is preceded also by Asp 16. It is only in this case that we have to consider the validity of our previous assumption. We have calculated the free energy for the different cases

Fig. 6.

R1, R2, and NOE versus sequence.

The different parameters resulting from the model-free analysis are shown in Figure 7. S2 values are close to 1 for ordered residues and 0 for residues that are completely floppy. In PCI, most of the values lie between 0.8 and 1.0, indicating that the protein in mainly rigid. The profile of S2 values along the sequence is very similar to the local RMSD values shown in Figure 4. This indicates that the high RMSD values reflect real flexibility and not the lack of structural definition due to a low number of distance constraints. The flexible regions comprise the five Nterminal residues, the C-terminal ones (residues 37 and 38), and residues 19 and 20 at the end of the short 3/10

exchange behavior (Table IV), the conclusion that Asp 17 belongs to the third group of exchanging amide protons is not appreciably changed. DISCUSSION Comparison With the Crystal and a Previous NMR Solution Structure The availability of pure samples of the recombinant form of PCI allowed us to obtain a more refined structure of PCI than the one obtained in a previous solution study, as shown by the corresponding backbone RMSD. The average RMSD with respect to the mean structure reported by Clore and coworkers was 0.9 Å for the well-defined part of the backbone, whereas this value is only 0.35 Å in our structures. In addition, many more side-chains are well defined. This improvement in the precision is due to the larger number of NOEs assigned (497 vs 309) and to the stereospecific assignments of many of the side-chain protons, with the subsequent elimination of the pseudoatom correction in the distance constraint. The structure of PCI in the complex with carboxypeptidase A was determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.5 Å resolution8 nearly 20 years ago. The backbone RMSD between the average NMR structure and the crystallographic one is 0.9 Å for the well-defined residues (7­37), indicating that both structures are very similar but not identical. Moreover, the distance and J-coupling con-

where any or both of the consecutive aspartic residues are either in the carboxylate or in the carboxylic form. The obtained values range from 1.1 kcal mol 1 (both aspartic residues are in the carboxylate form) to 2.3 kcal mol 1 (both residues in the protonated form). If we take into account the errors in the estimation of kint as well as the standard error in kex,46 which is large because of its fast

Fig. 8. Distribution of slowly exchanging amide protons in the three-dimensional structure of PCI. Most protected protons, with an apparent G 4 kcal/mol, are shown in dark circles. Protons with intermediate G values (between 2 and 4 kcal/mol) are shown in open circles. Protons with small G values ( 2 kcal/mol) are shown in open squares. Hydrogen bonds involving amide protons are shown with dashed lines.

straint violations are much larger in the crystallographic structure than in the NMR structures (see Table II and Fig. SM1 in the supplementary material), indicating that the differences between both structures are genuine. The sum of residual distance violations is almost an order of magnitude larger in the crystal structure than in the average NMR structures. The backbone RMSD per residue is plotted in Figure 4. In some regions, the local differences between the solution and the crystal structures are larger than the RMSD between the ensemble of NMR structures. These comprise regions 15­21 and 27­29, which exhibit small but significant differences with the crystal structure. The latter is part of the contact region with carboxypeptidase A. Residues 15­19 adopt a helical conformation that forms a regular 3/10 helix in solution but that is somewhat distorted in the crystal. Larger differences are located around residues 19 and 20 and the two terminal segments, which are the most flexible parts of the protein according to the RMSDs and the S2 values. Distributions of backbone and angles in the 25 NMR structures and in the crystallographic one are shown in Figure 5. Most of the hydrogen bonds observed in solution and in the crystal structure are coincident. The exceptions are Trp 28 HN­ Thr 33 O, only observed in solution, and Phe 23 HN­Ala 21 O, only observed in the crystal. In addition, the hydrogen bond involving the carboxyl oxygen of Trp 28 is different in both structures, because in the crystal the donor atom is Ser 30 HN, whereas in solution it may be Ala 31 HN, Arg 32 HN, or Thr 33 HN, depending on the structure. With a strict criteria for hydrogen bonds detection (distance donoracceptor 2.4 Å), the ones corresponding to the 3/10 helix are only observed in solution, but if the distance donoracceptor is increased up to 2.8 Å, we may also consider more bonds to be formed in the crystal. The conformations of the side-chains in solution and in the crystal are, in general, similar. Only three residues in the core of the protein show side-chains with slightly different conformations (Ile 7, Cys 12, and Thr 33). On the surface, His 15 and Tyr 37 present well-defined 1 angles different from those in the X-ray structure, which must be

due to their interaction with residues of carboxypeptidase A in the latter case. Conformation of Asp 5 is also different: in the crystal, the two Asp 5 O side-chain atoms are at hydrogen bond distances of Ile 3 HN and Phe 23 HN, whereas these two side-chain hydrogen bonds are not observed in solution. However, most of the side-chains forming the contact surface with carboxypeptidase do not change their conformation in the solution structure of the free inhibitor. Comparison With Other Related Structures The global topology of PCI belongs to the general cystine knot motif,47 shared by proteins of different functionality, such as small toxins,48 antihemostatic,49 and EGF-like proteins,50 as well as other plant proteinase inhibitors. Different variations of this general motif have been proposed in the literature, depending on the topology of the disulfide bridges, the elements of secondary structure present, or the length of the loops connecting the cystine scaffold.47,51,52 Although belonging to the same folding motif, PCI does not present a high degree of structural homology with other members of the group under the criteria of the program DALI.37 Several proteins and protein domains from other families have been reported to have stretches which show a relatively close structural homology to PCI, thus defining a sort of "common structural module."37 Other proteins more recently submitted to the PDB display an even better superposition of their three-dimensional structure with the one of PCI. These are Hanatoxin1 (HTx1), a peptide toxin that inhibits the drk1 voltage-gated K channel,53 Huwentoxin-I, a neurotoxin from the venom of the spider Selenocosmia huwena,54 and SHL-I, a lectin isolated from the venom of the same species.55 The structures of all three proteins have been determined by NMR, and all of them contain flexible parts. If these flexible regions are removed from the best structural alignment obtained by DALI, the superposition between the different structures is really good (see Fig. 9). Around 25­30 residues can be aligned with a backbone RMSD of 1.6. This must be considered as a high similarity between proteins of unrelated sequence and function. It is

interesting that this similarity is not found by standard disulfide bridge alignment, as usually done with cysteinerich proteins. As shown in Figure 9, two disulfide bridges are maintained in all structures in approximately similar positions (those corresponding to 12­27 and 18 ­34 in PCI), whereas the third disulfide bridge (8 ­24 in PCI) does not match with the remaining disulfide bridge in the other three proteins (2­26, 2­17, and 2­14 for HTx1, Huwentoxin-I, and SHL-I, respectively). Values of the hydrogen exchange rates were not reported for these proteins. However, in Huwentoxin-I54 and SHL-I,55 the patterns of slowly exchanging amide protons were given. After structural alignment, the protons with slow exchange rates lie in almost the same positions as those of the most protected amide protons of PCI (those with G values 2.0 kcal/mol).

A common feature between these structures, also observed in other members of the cysteine knot family, is the presence of large hydrophobic patches on the protein surface, albeit lying at different parts of the molecular surface in each case. The cysteine knot appears to be a highly efficient motif for structure stabilization when function requires large hydrophobic surface exposed in small volumes, and, consequently, the folded structure can not be stabilized by simply burying hydrophobic surface. Dynamic Aspects PCI is probably the smallest protein for which 15N relaxation studies have been conducted. In larger proteins studied with the same methodology, it is common to find a correlation between dynamic parameters and secondary

structure. Normally, the elements of secondary structure are more rigid than the loops connecting them. The small content of secondary structure and the large number of loops existing in small cysteine knot proteins might suggest the presence of many flexible residues. However, our results indicate that PCI is essentially a rigid protein, with high values of S2, except in the two terminal ends and in the short segment 19 and 20. Most probably, the three disulfide bridges play a role in the low global flexibility observed. In general, the profile of S2 along the sequence is consistent with the local backbone RMSD values, but it does not agree with the crystallographic B-factors obtained in the complex with carboxypeptidase A. Although the crystallographic structure of PCI in the complex is very similar to its isolated solution structure, the dynamics of the different residues appear to be significantly different. These changes could be due to either crystal packing or interaction with carboxypeptidase A. These two effects cannot be distinguished until relaxation measurements of the complex in solution are conducted. PCI dynamics have been investigated by theoretical methods.56,57 In these molecular dynamics studies, the N-terminal residues exhibit a large flexibility, whereas the C-tail appears to be more rigid, with relatively small fluctuations in the neighborhood of the X-ray structure. However, the small-order parameters resulting from our dynamic measurements as well as the large structural RMSD values obtained for both tails of the protein indicate that both termini, the first five residues and at least the last two, are very flexible in solution. Nevertheless, there is a difference between the dynamic parameters obtained for the N- and the C-tail. In the N-tail, the data can be fitted by model II with a single-order parameter, S2, and a rapid internal motion, e, but in the C-tail, an exchange term in the s-ms timescale must be included to fit the relaxation data. It is tempting to hypothesize that the conformation of the C-tail found in the complex coexists in a relatively slow equilibrium (in the s-ms timescale) with a number of other conformations occurring in solution. Because the structure of PCI in the complex is the starting point for the molecular dynamics simulation, the relative lack of flexibility in the C-tail during the trajectories may reflect that slow exchange. The mobility of the C-tail is an important point to consider in the function of this protein, because in the complex of PCI with carboxypeptidase A, the C-terminal amino acid tail enters into the active site of the enzyme. After binding, the C-terminal glycine is cleaved off by the protease, and the carboxylate group of Val 38 makes a coordinate bond with the active site Zn2 . Some flexibility on these residues may be necessary for Val 38 to reach the active site. In summary, we can conclude that the two regions of PCI that interact with carboxypeptidase A have a different dynamics. The region comprising residues 22­30, which forms an extensive hydrophobic surface in contact, is mainly preorganized in the isolated PCI. On the other hand, the region of primary contact of PCI with the active site of carboxypeptidase A, which comprises the four

C-terminal residues of PCI, presents two different dynamic behaviors. Although residues 36 and 37 present a rather rigid conformation, thus defining the main orientation of the C-terminal tail, the last two residues are mobile in the isolated inhibitor and would undergo an induced fit into the active site of the enzyme.
