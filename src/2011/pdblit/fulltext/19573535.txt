NuRD and SIN3
histone deacetylase complexes in development
Transcription repression mediated through histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes is widespread, and mechanisms by which HDAC complexes act have been revealed by extensive studies in vitro and in cell culture. However, until recently, little has been known about the developmental roles of histone deacetylation. Mutants now exist for a number of members of the two major HDAC complexes (NuRD and SIN3) and some associated proteins. The emerging picture is that these complexes have specific functions in development, rather than being required for most cellular processes.

D

uring the development of an organism, a wide variety of cell fate decisions are taken based on specific inheritance or cell interactions. Ultimately, most of these decisions are carried out by sequence-specific transcription factors, through activation or repression of gene expression. Clearly, alterations of gene expression must occur in the context of chromatin, but until recently, only a few developmental roles for changes in chromatin structure were known. Over the past few years, a series of results has been helping to explain how chromatin regulation contributes to making developmental decisions. It has long been known that activation and repression of gene expression correlate with the acetylation state of histones. In general, acetylated histones are correlated with more open chromatin and active gene expression, whereas deacetylated histones correlate with closed chromatin and repressed gene expression. Early work using histone deacetylase inhibitors showed that they disrupted normal development, indicating that the acetylation state of histones is developmentally important (e.g. see Ref. 1). Recently, enzymes that carry out histone acetylation (histone acetyltransferases, or HATs) and deacetylation (histone deacetylases, or HDACs) have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 2). These function in several different large multiprotein complexes that are associated with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, which are thought to target the complexes to specific genes, leading to local chromatin modification. Many studies have been concerned with the biochemical activities of these complexes and have been conducted in vitro or in cell culture. However, recent in vivo work in several systems has provided some functional information during development. A good review of developmental roles of HATs has been published recently3. Here, I review developmental functions of the two major histone deacetylation complexes, NuRD (for nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation) and SIN3 and their associated proteins, focusing primarily on cases where mutants have been studied.

Below, I briefly summarize the composition and biochemical properties of these complexes.

The histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and two histone-binding proteins (RbAp46 and RbAp48) are also found in the SIN3 complex. In addition to histone-deacetylase activity, the NuRD complex has ATP-dependent nucleosomeremodelling activity because it contains Mi-2/CHD family proteins, which have a chromodomain, a DNA helicase/ATPase TIG August 2000, volume 16, No. 8

complexes have also been found in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis, suggesting that the complexes exist widely in animals and plants. Below, I describe known developmental functions for genes encoding NuRD or SIN3 members, or associated proteins in a range of different organisms (Table 2). As histone deacetylation appears to be a widely used repression mechanism, it might be expected that these two major HDAC complexes would each be needed for most cellular functions. However, surprisingly, the cases studied show that NuRD and SIN3 complexes have specific developmental roles, rather than being required for general cellular functions. It is possible that other, as yet uncharacterized HDAC complexes have more general roles; besides HDAC1 and HDAC2, at least four other HDACs have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 9). NuRD and SIN3 complexes appear to be needed for a range of developmental processes, at different times and places during development, therefore mutations in components have pleiotropic defects that can be difficult to interpret. For this reason, in most of the work described below, links to NuRD and SIN3 have come about from studying a developmental process, rather than by studying developmental functions for these complexes.

NuRD and SIN3 involvement in methylation
Besides interacting with sequence-specific transcription factors, NuRD and SIN3 might also play a role in transcriptional repression by DNA methylation. The methyl CpG-binding protein MeCP2 has been shown to recruit the SIN3 complex24. MeCP2 is important for human development: recently, it was found that mutations in MeCP2 are a cause of Rett syndrome, an X-linked progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that is a major cause of mental retardation in females25. Therefore, one possibility is that lack of repression of methylated genes might be involved in Rett syndrome. The NuRD complex also appears to have links with methylation in vertebrate cells, but data on this is not yet clear. The Xenopus NuRD component MBD3 shows a strong preference for methylated DNA in vitro, whereas mammalian MBD3 shows only a weak preference26, and the mammalian NuRD complex does not bind to methylated DNA (Ref. 5). However, another protein with a methyl CpG-binding domain, MBD2, which can interact with mammalian NuRD in vitro, does bind to methylated DNA in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that MBD2 might recruit NuRD to methylated DNA (Ref. 5). Recruitment by DNA methylation is clearly not the only mechanism by which NuRD and SIN3 act, as animals that lack DNA methylation (e.g. Drosophila and C. elegans) have genes that encode subunits of both complexes.

Only those components discusssed in this review are listed; see Ref. 9 for a list of additional associated proteins. a p66 has so far only been found in the Xenopus Mi-2­NuRD complex7.

domain of the SWI/SNF family, and PHD fingers. Another distinguishing feature of NuRD is the inclusion of MTA1 or the similar protein MTA2. MTA1 was originally identified as being overexpressed in metastatic carcinomas10; it has a number of defined domains11, including a zinc finger and a SANT domain12 (a region similar to the DNA binding domain of myb), but its biochemical function is not known. NuRD further contains MBD3 (similar to methyl CpG-binding domain proteins). In Xenopus, p66 of unknown function is also found in NuRD7. The SIN3 complex13­15 shares four core proteins with NuRD (HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46 and RbAp48) and additionally contains Sin3, SAP18 and SAP30 (Table 1). The functions of these latter proteins are not clear, but Sin3 is proposed to act as a scaffold for the complex, and SAP30 might couple the complex to particular repressors16,17. The SIN3 complex has been extensively studied with respect to its involvement in repression by nuclear hormone receptors such as the retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors, which can activate or repress transcription, depending on the presence of ligand. Two co-repressors, N-CoR (Ref. 18) and SMRT (Ref. 19), facilitate transcriptional repression by physically linking the SIN3 complex with receptors that are not bound to a ligand20,21. Interestingly, like MTA1, N-CoR and SMRT both contain SANT domains. The function of this domain is not known, but it is also found in proteins of the SWI/SNF and ADA chromatin-modifying complexes, suggesting that it has a role in chromatin regulation12. Further information on the biochemistry of NuRD and SIN3 can be found in recent reviews9,22,23. The NuRD complex has been identified in mammalian and Xenopus cells, and SIN3 in mammalian cells and yeast. However, subunits of the NuRD and SIN3

NuRD and repression by Polycomb group proteins
In Drosophila and mouse, Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain the repression of Hox gene expression27. They exist in complexes and are found associated with particular regions of DNA that show silencing activity, but their mechanism of action has been unclear until now. Recent data suggest that one mechanism by which PcG repression occurs could be through histone deacetylation via the NuRD complex28. In flies, the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Hunchback (Hb) initiates repression of Hox genes and PcG proteins maintain this repression.

identified dMi-2, which is similar to Mi-2 of the NuRD complex28. dMi-2 mutants arrest as first or second instar larvae with no obvious defects, which might be due to the abundant maternal dMi-2 mRNA produced. Embryos that lack this maternal mRNA could not be made because dMi-2 is essential for the development of germ cells. However, further genetic analyses of dMi-2 mutants proved informative: double mutants between dMi-2 and hb showed increased derepression of the Hox gene Ubx over hb mutants alone. A similar interaction was observed in double mutants between dMi-2 and PcG genes, including posterior sex combs and polycomb. Therefore, dMi-2 appears to function with Hb and PcG proteins in Hox repression. One possibility is that Hb might recruit NuRD by interaction with dMi-2, which would modify chromatin to allow binding of PcG proteins, or perhaps NuRD could directly recruit PcG proteins. Further support for an interaction between PcG proteins and histone deacetylases comes from a study of the mouse EED protein (homologue of the Drosophila PcG gene extra sex combs), a component of one of two distinct mammalian PcG complexes identified29,30. EED and the EED-containing complex physically interact with histone deacetylases, whereas the other complex (containing the human Polycomb homologue HPC2) does not30. Therefore, histone deacetylases might mediate repression by some, but not all, PcG proteins. Consistent with this idea, repression by Xpc1 (a Xenopus Polycomb homologue) is independent of histone deacetylase31, and HDACs do not copurify with PRC1, a Drosophila PcG complex containing the Polycomb protein32. This contradicts the suggestion of Kehle et al.28 that dMi-2 (and therefore a histone deacetylase complex) might be involved in repression by Polycomb. However, the genetic interaction seen could have been indirect and caused by the inhibition of two pathways in parallel, one involving histone deacetylase and one not.

NuRD, Ras and patterning in C. elegans
In C. elegans, studies of histone deacetylase complex members have been greatly facilitated by the use of the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. Introduction of double-stranded RNA corresponding to a gene of interest into worms will inactivate that gene by targeting the endogenous mRNA for degradation33,34. Initially, it was found that the histone deacetylase gene hda-1 and the RbAp46/48 homologues rba-1 and rba-2 (the latter now known to be lin-53) are essential for embryogenesis35. hda-1 was shown to antagonize the activity of the histone acetyltransferase-encoding gene cbp-1, perhaps through inhibition of differentiation, but the study did not define clear developmental roles for these HDAC complex proteins. Subsequent work has shown that NuRD complex members are important for embryonic patterning, Hox expression and function, Wnt signalling, and antagonizing the Ras pathway during vulval development . Three groups identified mutations in egl-27, one of two C. elegans homologues of the NuRD component MTA1, and characterized different aspects of the mutant phenotype11,36,37. These studies showed that EGL-27 has numerous roles in patterning during development. For example, in egl-27 mutants, anterior­posterior patterning of ventral ectodermal cell fates is abnormal37. The defects are caused by posteriorly shifted Hox expression domains and by

unregulated Hox protein function: the Hox protein MAB5 is inappropriately active, and a combinatorial interaction between MAB-5 and another Hox protein, LIN-39, does not occur in the absence of EGL-27. Therefore, proper activity of these homeodomain transcription factors requires EGL-27. As EGL-27 is likely to function as part of a C. elegans NuRD complex, NuRD might be needed to carry out Hox directed patterning generally. Another analysis of egl-27 mutants revealed defects in two processes controlled by wnt signalling36: the polarity of an asymmetric cell division and the migration of the QL neuroblast are incorrect (this latter defect is at least partly due to lack of expression of the Hox gene mab-5). Finally, egl-27 and a second C. elegans MTA1 homologue, egr-1, were shown to be partially redundant in overall embryonic body patterning11. Embryos lacking EGL-27 and EGR-1 are very disorganized but have normal cell divisions and tissue differentiation, suggesting a specific role in body patterning. A similar phenotype is obtained after inactivating the histone deacetylase gene hda-1 by RNAi (Ref. 35; F. Solari and J. Ahringer, unpublished), supporting the idea that EGL-27 and EGR-1 functions are carried out through a histone deacetylase complex. In Drosophila, the HDAC gene Rpd3 is important for segmentation of the embryo, suggesting that, as in C. elegans, HDAC complexes are important for embryonic patterning38. Further work on egr-1 and an earlier study of hda-1 and an RbAb46/48 homologue lin-53 revealed a function in antagonizing Ras signalling in the C. elegans vulva39,40. Ras signalling induces vulval development in certain ventral ectodermal cells in C. elegans41. Two groups of functionally TIG August 2000, volume 16, No. 8

redundant genes (called synMuvA and synMuvB genes) help prevent the Ras pathway from inducing inappropriate vulval development adjacent to the normal vulva42. Studies of NuRD complex members (egr-1, egl-27, hda-1, rba-1, lin-53, chd-3 and chd-4; the latter two are homologues of Mi-2) found that they functioned to inhibit Ras-induced vulval development through the synMuv pathways39,40. A large interaction study confirmed physical association between some of these C. elegans NuRD proteins43. The results suggest that the NuRD complex is needed for repression of vulval development genes that are activated by Ras signalling. By looking at the phenotypes caused by lack of different NuRD members, it was found that egr-1 behaved differently from the other NuRD members. Whereas hda-1, rba-1, lin-53, chd-3 and chd-4 function within the synMuvA and the synMuvB pathways, EGR-1 functions only in the synMuvA pathway40. This suggests that the NuRD component MTA1 (EGR-1) might act as an adaptor to the complex rather than being an integral part of it. A protein that functions only in the synMuvB pathway, LIN-35, is a homologue of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein39, a transcriptional co-repressor44. Rb physically interacts with histone deacetylases45, raising the possibility that LIN-35 (Rb) could bring NuRD to DNA. The data suggest that the synMuv pathways might function redundantly to regulate or recruit the NuRD complex. Further work on this system should provide a better understanding of the tissue-specific recruitment of NuRD.

Rules of NuRD and SIN3 in development

A NuRD member in Arabidopsis
The NuRD complex probably also exists in plants, as the PICKLE (PKL, aka GYMNOS) gene of Arabidopsis was recently shown by two groups to encode an Mi-2 homologue46,47. An earlier study of pkl mutants showed that they inappropriately express embryonic differentiation characteristics during post-embryonic development48. For example, LEC1, a seed-specific transcription factor that promotes embryonic identity, is derepressed post-embryonically in pkl mutants47, as are seed-storage protein and storage lipid-deposition genes48. Therefore, PKL is necessary to repress embryonic development to allow the transition to post-embryonic development. A second group isolated pkl mutants as genetic enhancers of crabs claw (crc) mutants46. On their own, the pkl mutants displayed pleiotropic defects, but a general characteristic is the delayed maturation of a number of different tissue types. This phenotype is consistent with a role for PKL in repressing meristematic genes, similar to that proposed for PKL in repressing embryonic genes. Together, the studies suggest that the transition to a determined cell type at two different stages of Arabidopsis development requires repression of genes that promote a more pluripotent character. A plausible mechanism for repression of embryonic and meristematic genes by PKL is via histone deacetylation by the NuRD complex

Aiolos, they associate with HDAC complexes, suggesting that they have a repressive function. In one study, the Ikaros and Aiolos proteins were found to interact directly with the mouse Mi2 protein; in T cells, they are associated with a large complex that is likely to be NuRD (Ref. 50). The finding that Mi-2 proteins interact with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, both in mouse cells (Ikaros and Aiolos) and in Drosophila (Hb; see above), suggests that they might generally link NuRD to transcription factors. Immunolocalization studies support the idea that Ikaros and Aiolos function in transcriptional repression50. In resting T cells, Ikaros, Aiolos, HDAC1 and Mi2 all have a diffuse nuclear localization pattern. However, upon T-cell activation, they associate with toroidal structures around heterochromatin. Localization of HDAC1 and Mi2 to regions of heterochromatin is lost in Ikarosdeficient T cells, suggesting that Ikaros recruits HDAC1 and Mi2 to these structures. As gene expression is generally inhibited in heterochromatin, these localization studies indicate that Ikaros and Aiolos probably have a repressive function in T-cell development. In another study, Ikaros and Aiolos were found to associate with the SIN3 complex and to physically interact with Sin3 isoforms51. Interaction of Ikaros and Aiolos with SIN3 and NuRD suggests that they might act in different ways on two different sets of genes. One possibility is that the association with NuRD (which has a nucleosome-remodelling activity) could cause histone deacetylation in inaccessible regions, whereas the SIN3 complex might repress active genes. Further complexity is added by the finding that Ikaros is also associated with a SWI/SNF complex (thought to function in activation of gene expression)50. The association with two different repressive complexes (NuRD and SIN3), as well as with an activating complex, indicates that Ikaros and Aiolos probably have a number of different activities in gene regulation. The identification of target genes and further regulators will be needed to help define gene-specific activities.

SIN3 and repression by nuclear hormone receptors
A wealth of biochemical data has established that unliganded nuclear hormone receptors repress transcription through interaction with co-repressors such as N-CoR and SMRT, which associate with the SIN3 complex (reviewed in Ref. 52). A recent study of the Drosophila Ecdysone receptor (EcR) has provided evidence for this type of regulation in vivo53. EcR is a nuclear hormone receptor that functions as a heterodimer with the Drosophila retinoic X receptor (RXR) homologue ultraspiracle (USP)54. The EcR­USP heterodimer is a key regulator in moulting and metamorphosis, and acts as either a transcriptional activator or repressor, depending on the presence of the hormone ecdysone. Mutations in EcR are lethal and cause developmental defects55. In vitro, EcR was found to associate with mammalian SMRT, and this is necessary for its repressive activity53. The protein encoded by a mutant allele of EcR (A483T) cannot mediate repression and, importantly, does not interact with SMRT, suggesting this EcR mutant fails in repression because it cannot associate with the SIN3 complex. This work was satisfyingly brought back to Drosophila with the results of a two-hybrid screen for proteins that

Conclusions and future prospects
Given the finding that NuRD and SIN3 have wide developmental roles, those studying transcriptional repressors involved in development should keep an eye out for their involvement. It might emerge that most developmental decisions involving transcriptional repressors require an HDAC complex, either NuRD, SIN3, or a different complex. It is almost certain that other HDAC complexes exist: in addition to HDAC1 and HDAC2 found in these complexes, at least four additional histone deacetylases (HDAC3­6) are known (reviewed in Ref. 9), and recent work on HDAC4 indicates a link to myogenesis59,60. These initial studies should act as a springboard for further in vivo research that will identify additional functions for NuRD and SIN3. Many more adaptors and even new core components and complexes are likely to be found biochemically, and their study will probably reveal that the picture is far more complex than is now apparent. In the future, one of the most important goals will be the identification of target genes and additional transcription factors that function with HDAC complexes, as their study should allow the understanding of how, where and when NuRD and SIN3 act.

interacted with EcR (Ref. 53). Here, a Drosophila homologue of SMRT and N-CoR (named SMRTER) was isolated. SMRTER also interacts directly with Drosophila Sin3 (dSin3A). Genetic interactions between dSin3A mutants and those in EcR provided additional evidence supporting the idea that the SIN3 complex is necessary for repression by EcR. Therefore, the mechanism by which EcR mediates transcriptional repression in Drosophila is probably the same as that occurring in mammals: the SMRTER co-repressor links the nuclear hormone receptor EcR with the SIN3 complex. Besides acting with EcR, dSin3A clearly has additional roles in Drosophila development. dSin3A mutants are embryonic lethal56 and were also isolated as genetic enhancers of a mutant in the sina gene, which aids transmission of Ras signalling in the eye57. Nuclear hormone receptors and HDACs have also been implicated in human leukaemia58. Translocations of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) with promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) or promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) result in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Histone deacetylase inhibitors improve the response of APL cell lines to retinoids, indicating that the RAR translocations mediate leukaemogenesis through recruitment of an HDAC complex. This study suggests that pharmacological manipulation of HDAC or co-repressor activity might be a useful approach in disease treatment.

New uses for new haplotypes
the human Y chromosome, disease and selection
Recent discoveries of many new genes have made it clear that there is more to the human Y chromosome than a heap of evolutionary debris, hooked up to a sequence that happens to endow its bearer with testes. Coupled with the recent development of new polymorphic markers on the Y, making it the best-characterized haplotypic system in the genome, this gives us new opportunities to assess its role in disease and selection, through association studies with phenotypes such as infertility and cancers. However, the peculiar genetics of this bizarre chromosome means that we should interpret such studies particularly cautiously.
fter we are born, the first thing anyone wants to know about us is our sex ­ boy or girl? Unlike the other phenotypic variation among humans, this most fundamental of differences is conferred by the presence or absence of a chromosome: the Y chromosome determines maleness through the action of a single gene, SRY (sex-determining region Y)1. For many years it was thought that there were very few other Y-chromosomal genes, although genetic evidence had long suggested that the Y also bears loci that are important in spermatogenesis2. Recent developments have now revealed a large number of additional genes (Ref. 3; Fig. 1), including some that play roles in fundamental cellular processes3,4. These findings raise two important and connected questions. First, what is the role of the Y in disease? If differential susceptibilities to important disorders exist, then this will have implications for aetiologies, screening programmes and possibly treatment. Second, to what extent is natural selection acting on the Y chromosome? This question is becoming of increasing importance as greater emphasis is placed on the Y chromosome as a tool for the study of human evolution: if selection, as well as neutral processes such as genetic drift and population history, influences the distribution of Y-chromosomal variation in human populations, then this must be taken into account.

The recent advances in our knowledge about Y-chromosomal genes have been mirrored by a massive increase in the number of available polymorphic markers (e.g. Ref. 5), and we now possess the molecular tools to study Y-chromosomal diversity in fine detail (Box 1; Fig. 2), and so to address these questions. While most of the polymorphisms themselves are probably neutral, we can use them to look for associations with particular phenotypes and, conversely, to ask if phenotypes are influencing the distributions of polymorphisms within populations. The first studies of these kinds have now been published but, because of the peculiar genetics of the Y chromosome, they are not as easy to interpret as the more usual autosomal association studies, and they need critical evaluation. The purpose of this article is to review evidence for a role for the Y chromosome in disease and selection, and to propose ways in which its influence can be assessed.

The Y chromosome, human evolution and selection
