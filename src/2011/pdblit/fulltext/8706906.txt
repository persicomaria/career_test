Clayton Foundation Biochemical Institute and tb Department of Chemistry, the University of Texas, Austin, Texas 78'712 Received August 1, 1966 The substrate specificity of a purified lysyl-ribonucleic acid synthetase of Escherichia coli 9723 has been studied by determining the effects of a group of lysine analogs upon (a) the enzymic transfer of lysine-14C to soluble ribonucleic acid and (b) lysine-dependent ATP-pyrophosphate exchange. At relatively high levels, 4acid, and trans-4-dehydrolysine (but not cis-4oxalysine, 2,6-diamino-4-hexynoic dehydrolysine) replace lysine in catalyzing the exchange reaction. Oxalysine, 2,6diamino-4-hexynoic acid, and trans-dehydrolysine inhibit enzymic transfer of lysine to soluble ribonucleic acid; the cis-isomer also inhibits lysine utilization but is less effective than the trans-isomer and other analogues. Thus the activation of lysine appears to require a conformation in which the 3 and 6 carbons are in a trans-like position, but binding with the enzyme can occur with other conformations.

The ability of trans-4-dehydrolysine to serve as an antagonist of lysine, in contrast to the relative inactivity of the &-isomer as a growth inhibitor of several microorganisms, suggested that a conformation of lysine in which the 3 and 6 carbons are in a trans-like arrangement was essential for binding to enzymes involved in lysine utilization (1). In the present work with a partially purified preparation of lysyl ribonucleic acid synthetase from Escherichia coli 9723, the activities of lysine analogues with restricted conformations have been determined. On the basis of studies of the lysine-dependent ATP-PPi exchange reaction and of the transfer of 1ysineX to soluble ribonucleic acid (sRNA), either trans-4-dehydrolysine or 2,6-diamino4-hexynoic acid competitively inhibits lysine utilization and undergoes the activation process, as indicated by their abilities to replace lysine in the ATP-PPi exchange reaction. In contrast, cis-4-dehydrolysine binds the enzyme as indicated by its inhibitory effects but does not replace lysine in the exchange reaction. These results suggest that activation of lysine occurs with a conformation in which carbons 3 and 6

are in a trans-like position, but that, binding to the enzyme can occur with other conformations of the substrate. Since completion of this work, reports by R. Stern and A. H. Mehler have appeared (2, 3) which describe the purification of lysyl ribonucleic acid synthetase from another strain of E.

EXPERIMENTAL

PROCEDURE

Materials. Uniformly labeled L-lysine-1% and other 14C-labeled compounds were obtained from Schwarz BioResearch Inc. The sRNA (from E. coli type B) was obtained from General Biochemicals, and the DEAE-cellulose, type 20, was obtained from Brown Company. Assay for 1ysyLsRNA synthctase activity. Each reaction mirture was composed of 0.02 mu Llysine-14C (containing approximately 200,000 cpm), 1 mM disodium ATP, 2 mM P-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM MgC12, enzyme, 200 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and 1.0 mg of sRNA/ml, in a total volume of 0.50 ml. The mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at 37". Because of the rapid deacylation of lysyl-RNA at pH 8.0, longer incubation times were avoided. The reaction was terminated in each tube by the addition of 3 ml of cold (0") 67yo ethanol containing 0.5 M sodium chloride.

LYSYL-RIBONUCLEIC The precipitated sRNA was then washed three times with cold 67y0 ethanol containing 0.5 M sodium chloride, and finally once wit,h cold 67y0 et,hanol. The washed sRNA from each tube was then dissolved in 1.00 ml of water, and a 0.50-ml aliquot was plated and dried; the radioactivity was then measured by means of a Beckman LowBeta counter. Assay for amino acid-dependent ATP-PPS ezchange. Each reaction mixture contained 1.0 mM disodium ATP, 10 mM MgC12, 2 mu fi-mercaptoethanol, 200 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mM sodium 32P-pyrophosphate (30,000-60,OOG cpm) and either lysine or analogs as indicated, in a total volume of 1.0 ml; and the mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at 37". The amount of exchange was measured as described elsewhere (4). Enzyme preparation. Escherichia coli (ATCC 9723) cells were cultured and harvested as previ(5). All subsequent operations ously described were carried out at temperatures of 4" or slightly lower. Wet cell paste (39 gm) was resuspended in 230 ml of cold 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Cells in the thick suspension were broken in 50-ml portions with a 10 kc Raytheon sonic oscillator during a 15-minute period. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 0" and 30,COOg for 1 hour. A portion of the supernatant liquid (60 ml) from the crude cell extract was adjusted (at 0") to pH 5.9 by the drop-wise addition of 0.5 M acetic acid during continuous stirring. This and subsequent precipitates obtained by further acidification (in the pH ranges 5.9-5.7 and 5.7-5.2) were each recovered by centrifugation at 30,OOOg for 45 minutes at 0". The pellet precipitated at pH 5.7-5.2 was resuspended in 60 ml of 0.1 M TrisHCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.01 M @mercaptoethanol. Typically about 60% of the activity was recovered in this precipitation (Table I). The resuspended pH 5.7-5.2 fraction (60 ml) was brought to 45% of saturation by addition of cold saturated ammonium sulfate solution. Precipitation was allowed to occur for 15 minutes at 0" with constant stirring before centrifugation at 30,OOOg for 45 minutes. The supernatant liquid was then by the addition of satraised to 65% saturation urated ammonium sulfate solution. The resulting precipitate was treated and collected in the same manner. The pellet was resuspended in 12 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.01 M ,%mercaptoet~hanol. The lysyl-RNA synthetase activity was associated with the 45-65y0 ammonium sulfate (45-65 AS) fraction (Table I). The 45-65 AS fraction (6.3 ml) was dialyzed for two l-hour periods, each time against 630 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.01 M fi-mercaptoethanol. The resulting 8.0 ml of dia-

This column, prepared from 0.72 gm of DEAE-cellulose, had previously been successively washed with water three times, treated with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide, washed with water, treated with 0.1 M HCl, washed with water, and finally washed with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.01 M @.mercaptoethanol. The weight ratio of DEAE-cellulose to protein was about 15. The column was washed with 24 ml of the same buffer, followed by 24-ml portions of buffer (including fl-mercaptoethanol) containing increasing concentrations of potassium chloride (0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.10 M), at a flow rate of about 0.3 ml per minute. The active fractions (0.075 and 0.10 M KCl), after addition of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) could be stored at -15" for at least 4 weeks without appreciable loss of activity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

SpeciJicity of lysyl-sRNA synthetase CKtivity. Amino acid supplements were tested for their effect upon enzymic transfer of L-lysine-l*C (10 mpmoles, in t'he 0.5 ml mixture as described above) to sRNA. A supplement of 1.0 pmole of L-lysine-`*C reduced by 95% the amount, of radioactivity transferred to sRNA; a supplement of 100 mpmoles of n-lysine-`*C resulted in no appreciable reduction. Supplements of each of the other 19 protein-derived amino acids (L-isomer of arg, cys, his, met, and pro; racemic forms of the others) caused no appreciable reduction in transfer of radioactivity.

assay resulted in no appreciable transfer of radioactivity to sRNA, in the cases of seven amino acids separately tested (arginine-*4C, asparagine-14C!, glutamic acidJ4C, glycine14C, histidineJ4C, leucineJ4C, and tryptophan-14C, each 40 PM, approximately 200,000 cpm per tube.) Optimum pH and other conditions for transfer reaction. At pH 8.5 (under the assay conditions otherwise as described in Experimental Procedure) the rate of transfer of n-lysine-14C to sRNA, averaged over 7 minutes of incubation, was approximately twice that at pH 8.0; and the latter was more than ten times greater than the rate of transfer in a mixture buffered at pH 7.5. In mixtures incubated for longer periods (20-60 minutes), the count of radioactivity transferred to sRNA either decreased with increasing time (pH 8.5) or remained constant (pH 8.0). To ensure a nearly timelinear rate of lysine transfer to sRNA (and avoid losses of lysyl-RNA presumed due to deacylation at higher pH), transfer assays routinely were incubated at pH 8.0 for 10 minutes, even though a higher initial transfer rate would occur at pH 8.5. The approximate half-life, in 1 M Tris-HCI buffers, of lysylRNA (sRNA previously loaded with L-lysineJ4C) was 7 minutes at pH 8.0, or 12 minutes at pH 7.5. The optimum Mg++ concentration was 10 mM for transfer of lysineJ4C to sRNA, as determined by variation of MgClz over the range 240 m&q with a rate-limiting amount

of enzyme and other conditions as described for the transfer assay. The K, value for Mg++ under these conditions was 7.6 X 1O-3 M. Replacement of the Mg++ by other metals (each 10 mM) resulted in the following percentages of optimal rate of lysine-14C transfer: Zn++, 85%; Ca++, 63 %; Mn++, 53 %. The K, values for other substrates were approximately as follows: lysine, 2 X 1O-5 M; disodium ATP, 4 X 1O-4M; and sRNA, 2.5 mg crude sRNA per milliliter. These were calculated from plots of reciprocal reaction velocity versus reciprocal substrate concentration with all components, other than the variable, as described above for the transfer assay. Potassium ion moderately inhibits the transfer of lysine to sRNA; with dipotassium ATP (1 mM, the optimal level) the rate of transfer was about 84% of that observed with optimal sodium ATP concentration (also 1 mM). The addition of potassium chloride to the mixture (with other components as described above for the transfer assay) reduced the rate of transfer of lysine.J4C to sRNA to the following percentages of the rate without added KCl: 5 mM KCl, 89%; 10 mM, 82%; 25 mu, 65 %. Inorganic pyrophosphate strongly inhibits the enzymic transfer of lysine to sRNA, the rate of transfer being reduced to one-half by sodium pyrophosphate at a level (0.02 mM) lower than that present in exchange assays.

F'32Pi exchange catalyzed by the lysine activating enzyme was undertaken. Under the assay conditions described in Methods, the effect of variation in lysine concentration upon the rate of the exchange reaction was as indicated in the reciprocal plot of Fig. 2A. The K, for n-lysine calculated from these data is 5.9 X 1O-6M. The rate of the exchange reaction at various pH values, with conditions otherwise as described in Methods, is shown in Fig. 3. The pH range could here be carried to higher values, in contrast to the corresponding determination for the transfer reaction in which the deacylation reaction is a limitation to measurements at high pH. For the ATP-PPi exchange reaction, the pH optimum appears to be approximately 9.5; however, routine exchange reaction studies were done with the incubation mixtures at pH 8.0, in order to allow comparison of results with transfer reaction studies. The exchange reaction was essentially linear with time up to 30 minutes of incubation. In other studies in this laboratory concerning other amino acid activating enzymes, previously reported by Ravel et al. (4), the K, value (e.g., for glutamic acid) obtained in the exchange reaction was lowered by the addition of sRNA to the exchange reaction mixture. In the present study, lysine-dependent ATP-pyrophosphate exchange is inhibited by the presence of sRNA. The K, values, as indicated by plots of reciprocal exchange activity versus reciprocal substrate concentration (Fig. 2, graphs B, C, and D) were respectively 6.6 X 10u4, 9.9 X lOA, and 5.5 X 1O-4 for the oxalysine, transdehydroIysine, and diaminohexynoic acid analogues. Figure 4 indicates the competitive relationship of cis-dehydrolysine to lysine, in supporting the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction. nn-cis-4-Dehydrolysine did not detectably replace lysine as a substrate for the exchange reaction. Discussion. A study of the specificity of the enzyme by the use of two assay systems, namely, the ATP-P32P exchange reaction, and the formation of lysyl-RNA (the transfer reaction), showed that since both transand cis-isomers of dehydrolysine could inhibit lysyl-14C-RNA formation competitively, presumably they both occupied the

same active site on the lysyl-RNA synthetase enzyme as lysine. The cis isomer apparently cannot be activated, since it was not effective as a substrate in supporting ATPP32P exchange; however, the cis isomer competitively inhibited lysine-dependent ATP-PP exchange. Although the binding of lysine to lysyl-RNA synthetase is apparently not entirely dependent upon conformation of the substrate, a conformation in which the 3 and 6 carbons are in a trans-like position appears to be required for the activation reaction. Since many of the amines corresponding to amino acids have been found to inhibit activation of the related amino acid, it appears likely that in the case of lysine, the distance between the two amino groups may be of considerable importance in binding specificity. The activity of 2, B-diaminohexynoic acid, having a linear arrangement of carbons 3 through 6, indicates that some flexibility exists in the required distances between the amino groups for binding to the enzyme. The distances between the amino groups in different conformations of cisldehydrolysine are in general smaller than the distances in various conformations of the trans-isomer, and it may be suggested that the binding restrictions are such as to displace the carboxyl group in the cis-isomer away from the other substrate, adenosine triphosphate, so that activation does not occur.
