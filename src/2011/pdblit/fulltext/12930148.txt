Inhibitors of human mast cell tryptase (EC 3.4.21.59) have therapeutic potential for treating allergic or inflammatory disorders. We have investigated transition-state mimetics possessing a heterocycle-activated ketone group and identified in particular benzothiazole ketone (2S)-6 (RWJ-56423) as a potent, reversible, low-molecular-weight tryptase inhibitor with a Ki value of 10 nM. A single-crystal X-ray analysis of the sulfate salt of (2S)-6 confirmed the stereochemistry. Analogues 12 and 15-17 are also potent tryptase inhibitors. Although RWJ56423 potently inhibits trypsin (Ki ) 8.1 nM), it is selective vs other serine proteases, such as kallikrein, plasmin, and thrombin. We obtained an X-ray structure of (2S)-6 complexed with bovine trypsin (1.9-Å resolution), which depicts inter alia a hemiketal involving Ser-189, and hydrogen bonds with His-57 and Gln-192. Aerosol administration of 6 (2R,2S; RWJ-58643) to allergic sheep effectively antagonized antigen-induced asthmatic responses, with 70-75% blockade of the early response and complete ablation of the late response and airway hyperresponsiveness.
Activated mast cells secrete numerous proinflammatory mediators including histamine, arachidonate metabolites, and proteases. An important mediator is the serine protease tryptase (EC 3.4.21.59), which is a heparin-associated, homotetrameric trypsin-like enzyme that constitutes 20-25% of the total protein of human mast cells.1-3 Since tryptase is stored in a catalytically active form (rather than as a zymogen) within the secretory granules and released on stimulation, this enzyme is thought to be highly relevant to mast celldependent inflammatory conditions.1-3 Indeed, tryptase has been directly implicated in the pathology of asthma.4 Consequently, inhibitors of human mast cell tryptase have therapeutic potential for treating allergic or inflammatory disorders such as asthma, vascular injury (e.g., restenosis and atherosclerosis), inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.5 In this respect, tryptase inhibitors have attracted therapeutic interest, and several types of compounds have been reported,5,6 such as APC366 (1), which advanced into phase 2 clinical trials but was discontinued,5a,b Babim (2),6a and bifunctional ligand 3 (Chart 1).6b The biological mechanisms by which tryptase contributes to cellular inflammatory responses are not yet completely understood. Although tryptase cleaves and inactivates certain proteins, its range of activity is somewhat limited. On the other hand, tryptase can be

particularly detrimental because there are no endogenous protease inhibitors for it. Interestingly, tryptase is one of the few proteases (trypsin being the other) that can effectively activate protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a tethered-ligand G-protein-coupled receptor, by cleavage of its elongated, extracellular N-terminus.7 PAR-2, which has been implicated in various inflammatory processes, may be responsible for some of the physiological and pathophysiological effects of tryptase. Since no receptor antagonists for PAR-2 have yet been identified, inhibitors of tryptase offer one of the few means for interrupting PAR-2 activity. Our interest in tryptase emerged from the confluence of research on thrombin inhibitors8 and PAR-2.9 In studying tripeptide heterocycle-activated ketones that potently inhibit thrombin, such as RWJ-50353 (4; Ki ) 0.19 nM),8a,b we probed the minimally acceptable pharmacophore by eliminating different segments of the molecule. We prepared 5 (RWJ-51084), which is only comprised of a single amino acid residue and found it to be a weak thrombin inhibitor (Ki ) 12 300 nM), but a reasonably potent inhibitor of trypsin (Ki ) 30 nM).10 Subsequently, we learned that 5 also effectively inhibits tryptase, with a Ki value of 88 nM (Table 1), while being quite selective over other serine proteases such as kallikrein, factor Xa, and chymotrypsin. This level of inhibitory potency is rather impressive given the relatively low molecular weight (MW ) 387.5) and simple structure of 5. Our reported X-ray structure determination on a cocrystal of 5 (actually the 2S enantiomer) with trypsin10 shows the inhibitor occupying the active site with its guanidine group in the S1 specificity pocket

Results and Discussion Drug Design. To explore structure vs activity surrounding 5, and to enhance potency and selectivity, we considered introducing some additional sites for interaction with groups in the active site of tryptase, particularly around the S2 region. Since thrombin inhibitor 4 is also a potent inhibitor of tryptase, with a single-digit nanomolar Ki value (Table 1), we considered converting the cyclopentyl ring of 5 into an L-proline and attaching simple N-acyl groups. An N-acyl-L-proline could introduce a hydrogen bond between the acyl carbonyl and the backbone NH of Gly-216 in the active-site -sheet.3 Secondarily, we thought that a polar group, such as a hydroxyl, on the proline ring might provide an additional hydrogen bond with the Gln-98 amide side chain of tryptase. Compounds with these and related modifications were synthesized and bioassayed, thereby achieving a potency improvement of approximately 10fold with the best analogues, such as (2S)-6. Synthetic Chemistry. Representative chemistry is given for target compound (2S)-6, which was synthesized according to the route outlined in Scheme 1. Commercially available methyl 4-benzyloxy-L-prolinate, 7, was converted by N-acetylation and ester saponification to 813 in 41% yield. Arginine Weinreb amide 914 was reacted with excess 2-lithiobenzothiazole at low temperature, and the intermediate ketone was purified by chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc/hexane, 3:2) and then reduced with NaBH4 to a diastereomeric mixture of alcohols (ca. 1:1), which was deprotected to give 10. The amino group was acylated with 8 to furnish 11, which was purified by chromatography on silica gel (CH2Cl2/MeOH, 19:1), and the alcohol was oxidized with the Dess-Martin periodinane to the ketone, which was largely comprised of the L-arginine isomer.15 Treatment with anhydrous HF removed both the p-tosyl and benzyl moieties, and the resultant (2S)-6 was purified by reverse-phase HPLC (water/MeCN/CF3CO2H, 90:10:0.2 to 70:30:0.2; Bondapak C-18) and then converted into an HCl salt. Most of the other analogues discussed herein, 12-20 (Chart 2; Table 1), were prepared in a similar fashion. The syntheses of 6 and 8-25 are described in the Experimental Section. As noted above,15 (2S)-6 can easily suffer base-induced epimerization because of its labile proton R to the keto group. Stability studies on closely related 4 in rat and rabbit plasma showed that the arginine R-proton is completely equilibrated in 2 h under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Consequently, we also prepared a mixture of epimers, 6, by equilibrating (2S)-6 prior to HPLC purification and HCl salt formation (1.2:1 ratio of epimers). This epimeric mixture was used for antiasthma studies in conscious allergic sheep.16 Enzyme Inhibition. Our compounds, along with reference inhibitor 2, were tested for inhibition of human -tryptase and bovine trypsin (Table 1). The data illustrate the importance of the native 2S absolute stereochemistry in both the arginine and proline moieties for high affinity: cf. (2S)-6 with (2R)-6; 12 with 13. As expected, a basic side chain substituent is essential for potent inhibition: cf. 24 with 6 and 22. Although an activated ketone is required for strong inhibition, contributions from P2 are equally important: cf. 6 with 23 and 25. In addition, hydrophobic

a All compounds were isolated and purified by reverse-phase HPLC (typically water/MeCN/CF3CO2H, 70:30:0.1) and lyophilized as trifluoroacetate (TFA) hydrates, except where noted. All compounds were characterized by 300-MHz 1H NMR and electrospray MS; also, they were judged to be at least 95% pure by analytical HPLC. The compounds are represented by standard molecular formulas with the following adducts: 2 (3.0 HCl, 4.3 water), 4 (2.3 TFA, 0.8 water), 5 (1.25 TFA, 0.75 water), (2S)-6 (1.0 HNO3), (2R)-6 (1.0 HNO3, 0.3 TFA, 1.4 water), 6 (2.5 HCl, 2.2 water), 12 (1.3 TFA, 1.4 water), 13 (1.1 TFA, 1.1 water), 14 (1.2 TFA, 1.0 water), 15 (1.2 TFA, 0.8 water), 16 (1.2 TFA, 1.0 water), 17 (1.2 TFA, 0.5 water), 18 (1.28 TFA, 0.3 water), 19 (1.25 TFA, 1.15 water), 20 (1.3 TFA, 0.75 water), 21 (1.2 TFA, 1.0 water), 22 (1.0 TFA, 1.6 water), 23 (1.2 TFA, 1.0 water), 24 (1.0 water), 25 (1.2 TFA, 1.0 water). Microanalytical data (C, H, N; and water) were within the accepted range, unless noted otherwise. Information on the composition, microanalytical data, and enzymatic assays is given in the Supporting Information. The composition of 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, and 23-25 was presumed to be 1.2 TFA and 1.0 water for biological testing purposes because there was an insufficient quantity of material to conduct combustion microanalysis. b The 2S/2R epimeric ratio was determined by analytical HPLC, except where otherwise noted.

complexed to Asp-189, its ketone involved in a hemiketal bond with the O of Ser-195, and its benzothiazole nitrogen hydrogen bonded to N of His-57.8a,11 A comparison of this structural information with the active site of human -tryptase,3 by using computer graphics, revealed an opportunity to manipulate 5 to enhance potency as a tryptase inhibitor. In this manner, we discovered the potent, reversible, low-molecular-weight tryptase inhibitor RWJ-56423, (2S)-6. Herein, we present the tryptase inhibitory activity for (2S)-6 and various analogues, an X-ray crystal structure of (2S)-6 complexed with bovine trypsin, and in vivo bioactivity for 6 (2R,2S mixture; RWJ-58643) in allergen-sensitized sheep.12

interactions of the P2 substituent are critical for good affinity: cf. 17 with 18. A benzothiazole group provided a more potent inhibitor than a thiazole group by a factor of ca. 8: cf. 6 with 21. Acetyl substitution on proline (12) led to affinity increases of 1.7-fold relative to mesyl (19) and 13-fold relative to benzoyl (20). The X-ray crystal structure of (2S)-6,trypsin (vide infra) suggests that this difference is associated with adverse steric interactions between inhibitor molecule 20 and Gly-216/ Trp-215 of the -sheet of tryptase. Proline and azetidine2-carboxylic acid substitution at the P2 position (S2 subsite) were equally effective, cf. 12 with 16; however, sp2-hybridized proline ring carbons decreased affinity: cf. 12 with 15 and (2S)-6 with 14. Substitution of proline with a trans-4-hydroxyproline gave equivalent potency: cf. 6 with 12.

Selectivity data for (2S)-6 relative to five other serine proteases are presented in Table 2, along with data for reference inhibitor 2. For comparison, published results for inhibitor 1 are also offered. These enzyme assays were conducted in the absence of any added zinc, conditions which can dramatically increase the serine protease affinity of 2 and its analogues.17 It is noteworthy that (2S)-6 is a considerably more potent tryptase inhibitor than 2 (Ki value of 10 vs 140 nM), which may be related to (2S)-6 having a better fit in the enzyme active site or forming a covalent hemiacetal with the Ser-195 hydroxyl of tryptase (see X-ray section). Neither (2S)-6 nor 2 was selective for tryptase over trypsin. Compound (2S)-6 was much more selective over thrombin than 2 (31 000 vs 32), and it was also significantly more selective than 2 vs plasma kallikrein (32 vs 0.7),

Since our attempts to obtain diffracting crystals of (2S)-6, tryptase were unsuccessful, the X-ray crystal structure of a complex between (2S)-6 and bovine pancreatic -trypsin was determined (Figure 1).18,19 Crystals of the (2S)-6,trypsin complex, trigonal space group P3121, were grown by the hanging-drop technique under the same conditions as reported for (2S)-5.10 Diffraction data were collected at -170 °C and processed to a resolution of 1.9 Å.19a The completeness of the data at this resolution was 98.6% and the final refinement had convergence at R ) 0.175 and Rfree ) 0.206 with 225 water molecules.

The overall structure of (2S)-6,trypsin (Figures 1 and 2) is analogous to that of (2S)-5,trypsin, although there are some significant differences. As expected, both inhibitors form a hemiketal adduct between the ketone carbonyl and the Ser-195 hydroxyl, a hydrogen bond between the benzothiazole nitrogen and N of His-57, and a hydrogen bond between the P1 amide carbonyl and the nitrogen of Gln-192. In the (2S)-6,trypsin complex, these bond lengths are 1.45, 3.16, and 2.71 Å, respectively. By contrast to (2S)-5,trypsin, the inhibitor in (2S)-6,trypsin extends more deeply into the S2 domain presumably because of additional hydrogen bonding involving the acetyl group of (2S)-6. Even though the hydroxyl group of (2S)-6 is a participant in

caused the expected airway resistance responses under control conditions (no drug treatment). Immediately after challenge there was a mean 300% increase over baseline in specific lung resistance (SRL; early response). SRL returned to baseline between 2 and 6 h post challenge and then increased again between 6 and 8 h post challenge to 100% over baseline (late response). When these same sheep were treated with 6, however, the early response was inhibited by 70-75% and the late response was completely blocked. Panel B of Figure 3 depicts the post antigen-induced changes in airway sensitivity. Prior to antigen challenge (BSL), the dose of carbachol that elicited a 400% increase in SRL (PC400) was the same for both the control experiments and the experiments with 6. Twenty-four hours after antigen challenge, the sheep in the control group developed airway hyper-responsiveness as evidenced by the 2-fold decrease in the PC400. When these sheep were treated with 6, this airway hyper-responsiveness was completely blocked, i.e., the post-challenge PC400 value was not different from the preantigen value. Conclusion We identified a series of the potent, reversible, lowmolecular-weight tryptase inhibitors, represented by 5 and (2S)-6. The compounds of interest are transitionstate mimetics that feature a heterocycle-activated ketone group, which can form a hemiketal with the -oxygen of Ser-195 and a hydrogen bond with the -nitrogen of His-57. An X-ray crystal structure of (2S)-6 bound to bovine trypsin at 1.9-Å resolution depicted these key interactions. In comparing the structure of (2S)-6,trypsin with (2S)-5,trypsin,10 (2S)-6 extends more deeply into the S2 domain of the enzyme, possibly because of the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the acetyl group of (2S)-6 and Gly-216 of trypsin. Since there is a high degree of homology between the active site cavities of tryptase and trypsin, a similar hydrogenbonding interaction could occur in the (2S)-6,tryptase complex. Given that 6 is ca. four times more potent than 5 as a tryptase inhibitor, the introduction of this planned interaction is an example of effective structurebased drug design. The incorporation of a proline hydroxyl into 12, to obtain 6, did not lead to increased tryptase affinity, nor to better selectivity vs trypsin. Hence, the intended hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl of 6 and the amide side chain of Gln-98 of tryptase is probably not formed. In our thrombin inhibitor studies,8a the 2-benzothiazole derivative was nearly 20 times more potent than the corresponding 2-thiazole derivative. In that case, we noted an aromatic stacking interaction between the benzene ring of the benzothiazole and Trp-60D. For tryptase inhibition, we found that benzothiazole 6 is eight times more potent than thiazole 21. Here, the benzothiazole group may be more effective than the thiazole because of increased ketone electrophilicity and/ or increased electron density on the ring nitrogen in the former.21 Additionally, the benzene ring of the benzothiazole may participate in a hydrophobic interaction with the Cys-42/Cys-58 disulfide bond of tryptase (cf. Figure 2). In the well-characterized sheep model of asthma, aerosol administration of 6 strongly blunted the early

a hydrogen bond network with several water molecules, this aspect does not lead to a significant increase in either trypsin or tryptase affinity (Table 1; cf. 6 with 12). Specifically, the acetyl carbonyl of (2S)-6 forms a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen of Gly-216 (length ) 3.01 Å), and the hydroxyl group of (2S)-6 forms a hydrogen bond network that links two water molecules to the carbonyl group of Ser-96 (lengths ) 2.82, 2.64, and 2.74 Å). Consequently, the minimum interatomic distance between the benzothiazole phenyl ring and the Cys-42/Cys-58 disulfide bond is increased by 1.07 Å, indicating a significant decrease in van der Waals interactions in (2S)-6,trypsin relative to the (2S)-5, trypsin (5.37 Å vs 4.30 Å). In addition, the plane of the proline ring of (2S)-6 is essentially parallel to the Ser213 through Ser-217 -strand, whereas the cyclopentyl ring of (2S)-5 is angled about 60° from the -strand. This change in ring orientation results in a decrease in van der Waals interactions, which is reflected by a 1.05 Å increase in the minimum interatomic distance between the Leu-99 methyl groups and the proline ring of (2S)-6 relative to the cyclopentyl ring of (2S)-5 (4.32 Å vs 3.27 Å, respectively). Antiasthmatic Activity of 6. We evaluated 6 (2R,2S mixture, RWJ-58643, HCl salt), for in vivo efficacy in conscious, antigen-sensitized allergic sheep, which is a well characterized asthma model.20 The inhibitor was administered by aerosol as a total dose of 9 mg, twice a day, for three consecutive days, and as a single, 9-mg dose on day 4, 2 h prior to antigen challenge (Figure 3). As depicted in panel A of Figure 3, inhaled antigen

N-[4-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]-1-(2-benzothiazolylcarbonyl)butyl]cyclopentanecarboxamide (5). Compound 10 (0.676 g, 1.0 mmol) and cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (0.285 g, 2.5 mmol) were coupled, oxidized, and deprotected to give 5 according to methodology described for 6.

A solution of 5-aminopentanoic acid (0.220 g, 1.88 mmol) and Na2CO3 (0.238 g, 2.24 mmol) in 3 mL of water was added dropwise to a solution of 1H-pyrazole-1-N,Nbis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)carboxamidine (0.584 g, 1.88 mmol) in 10 mL of methanol at 23 °C. After 2 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, diluted with water, and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was acidified to pH 3 with 1 M KHSO4 and extracted twice with 25 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4), and concentrated. The residue was crystallized from ethyl acetate/hexanes to give 5-[bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidino]pentanoic acid (0.49 g, 72%).

A full hemisphere of diffracted intensities (-scan width of 0.30°) was measured by using graphite-monochromated Mo KR radiation (from a normal-focus sealed X-ray tube operated at 50 kV and 40 mA) on a Bruker Single-Crystal SMART CCD Area Detector Diffraction System. Lattice constants were determined with the Bruker SAINT software package using peak centers for 3134 reflections. A total of 7805 integrated reflection intensities having 2(Mo KR) < 57.47° were produced using the Bruker program SAINT. Of these, 5101 reflections were unique and gave Rint ) 0.036. The Bruker SHELXTL-PC software package was used to solve the structure using "direct methods" techniques. All stages of weighted full-matrix lest-squares refinement were conducted using Fo2 data with the SHELTXPC software package. Final agreement factors at convergence are: R1 (unweighted, based on F) ) 0.051 for 3661 independent reflections have 2(Mo KR) < 57.47° and I > 2(I); R1 (unweighted, based on F) ) 0.082 and wR2 (weighted, based on F2) ) 0.120 for all 5101 independent reflections having 2(Mo KR) < 57.47°. The structural model incorporated anisotropic thermal parameters for all nonhydrogen atoms and isotropic thermal parameters for all hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen and nitrogen were located from a difference Fourier synthesis and included in the structural model as independent isotropic atoms. The methyl group was refined as a rigid rotor (using idealized sp3-hybridized geometry and a C-H bond length of 0.96 Å) with three rotational parameters in leastsquares cycles. The final refined values of these three rotational parameters gave C-C-H angles that ranged from 103° to 119°. The remaining hydrogen atoms were included in the structural model as fixed atoms (using idealized sp2- or sp3hybridized geometry and C-H bond lengths of 0.95-1.00 Å) "riding" on their respective carbons. The isotropic thermal parameters for hydrogen atoms were fixed at values 1.2 (nonmethyl) or 1.5 (methyl) times the equivalent isotropic thermal parameters of the carbon atoms to which they are covalently bonded.

A solution of (2S)-6 in DMSO was added in a 1.5-fold molar excess. Crystals of (2S)-6,trypsin were grown at 23 °C by using the hanging-drop, vapordiffusion technique (drops of 2 mL of protein solution mixed with 2 mL of reservoir solution were equilibrated against a reservoir solution of 0.1 M Tris HCl buffer at pH 7.75 containing 1.2 M MgSO4).10 The crystals belong to the trigonal space group P3121, with the unit cell parameters: a ) b ) 54.67 Å, c ) 107.87 Å; R ) ) 90°,  ) 120°. Diffraction data were collected at -170 °C using 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant on an R-AXIS IV imaging plate (Rmerge ) 0.08; I/ ) 11.5) and processed with DENZO to a resolution of 1.9 Å.19a The completeness of the data at this resolution is 98.6%. The structure is isomorphous with a previously reported bovine -trypsin structure (PDB entry 3PTN).19c This model, stripped of solvent molecules and calcium ion and with uniform thermal and occupancy parameters, was used for the initial refinement using XPLOR.19d Rigid body minimization, followed by simulated annealing with slow cooling,19e and conjugate gradient positional refinement were carried out. The molecular model of the inhibitor (2S)-6 was constructed and built into electron density by using CHEMNOTE of the QUANTA program suite. The ideal parameters for the inhibitor were derived from small-molecule structure information from the Cambridge Crystal Data Base.19f Manual corrections of the model complex were done during the refinement with the QUANTA graphics program. The refinement data were gradually extended to 1.9 Å resolution during the refinement. Solvent molecules were inserted at reasonable positions where the difference electron density exceeded 2.5 . Finally, the individual atomic B-values were refined. The final refinement,

(b) In this paper, we use the descriptors S and R with specific compounds to reflect the absolute stereochemistry at the stereocenter adjacent to the keto group, i.e., at the 2-position, according to the numbering shown for structures 5 and (2S)-6. The arginine-derived segment of (2S)-6 and its congeners possesses the L-Arg configuration. The synthesis of 8 without experimental details is reported in the following reference: Klein, S. I.; Dener, J. M.; Molino, B. F.; Gardner, C. J.; D'Alisa, R.; Dunwiddie, C. T.; Kasiewski, C.; Leadley, R. J. O-Benzyl hydroxyproline as a bioisostere for PhePro: novel dipeptide thrombin inhibitors. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996, 6, 2225-2230. (a) Tosyl-protected Weinreb amide 9 was used for the synthesis of hydroxylated derivatives (e.g., 6), whereas the corresponding 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylsulfonyl (Mtr)-protected Weinreb amide was preferred for preparing nonhydroxylated derivatives (e.g., 12). Mtr-protected guanidine intermediates were deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid over 6 h at 23 °C rather than anhydrous HF. (b) We prepared 9 according to the following reference except that crude 9 was triturated with ethyl acetate rather than being crystallized from ethanol: DiMaio, J.; Gibbs, B.; Lefebvre, J.; Konishi, Y.; Munn, D.; Yue, S. Y.; Hornberger, W. Synthesis of a homologous series of ketomethylene arginyl pseudodipeptides and application to low molecular weight hirudin-like thrombin inhibitors. J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 3331-3341. (c) For an alternative preparation of 9, see: Leung, D.; Schroder, K.; White, H.; Fang, N.-X.; Stoermer, M. J.; Abbenante, G.; Martin, J. L.; Young, P. R.; Fairlie, D. P.

synthesis of Boc-L-Arg(Mtr)N(OMe)Me, see: Deng, J.; Hamada, Y.; Shioiri, T.; Matsunaga, S.; Fusetani, N. Synthesis of cyclotheonamide B and derivatives. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1994, 33, 1729-1731. Also, see: Kahn, M. PCT Int. Appl. WO9630396 A1, 1996 (Example 2). Workup of this reaction was performed with sodium bicarbonate, which is sufficiently alkaline to epimerize the intermediate ketone with prolonged contact. Thus, the desired epimer needs to be isolated and acidified (which stabilizes it against stereomutation) as quickly as possible. The active diastereomer of 6 possesses the 2S configuration (see section on enzyme inhibition). This 2S structure is contained in the cocrystal with trypsin (see section on X-ray crystallography) and was confirmed by a separate single-crystal X-ray analysis of the sulfate salt of (2S)-6, details of which will be published separately.

Nature (London) 1998, 391, 608-612. Details of the X-ray crystal structure for (2S)-6,trypsin will be published separately.
