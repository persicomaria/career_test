Fragment-based lead discovery has been successfully applied to the aspartyl protease enzyme -secretase (BACE-1). Fragment hits that contained an aminopyridine motif binding to the two catalytic aspartic acid residues in the active site of the enzyme were the chemical starting points. Structure-based design approaches have led to identification of low micromolar lead compounds that retain these interactions and additionally occupy adjacent hydrophobic pockets of the active site. These leads form two subseries, for which compounds 4 (IC50 ) 25 µM) and 6c (IC50 ) 24 µM) are representative. In the latter series, further optimization has led to 8a (IC50 ) 690 nM).
Introduction Alzheimer's disease (ADa) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.1 The major components of these plaques are -amyloid peptides (A s), which are produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the activity of - and -secretases. -Secretase cleaves APP to reveal the N-terminus of the A peptides.2 The -secretase activity has been identified as the aspartyl protease beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), and this enzyme is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of AD.3-7 BACE-1 inhibitors have recently been reviewed.8,9 Most work has concentrated on the design of peptidomimetic inhibitors which usually employ a secondary alcohol as a transition state mimetic to displace the water molecule that sits between the two catalytic aspartic acids of the enzyme.10-19 A potential problem with peptidomimetics is that they tend to be relatively large and possess multiple hydrogen bond donors which may make them less attractive leads for a project which requires penetration across the blood-brain barrier and oral bioavailability.20,21 There has also been some work on the design of less peptidic22,23 or nonpeptidic inhibitors24-26 of BACE-1 although in the latter case, there have been no crystal structures to support the binding modes proposed or to develop SAR. There is therefore a great deal of interest in the identification of nonpeptidic inhibitors of BACE-1 and in the experimental determination of their associated binding modes. We have previously reported the X-ray crystal structure of BACE-1 in its apo form and complexed with a peptidomimetic inhibitor.27 A representation of the inhibitor bound to the active site of BACE-1 is given in Figure 1. The molecule forms a

number of key hydrogen bonds with the catalytic aspartate residues, but the recognition in this region is somewhat different to that seen with many other secondary alcohol-containing peptide-based inhibitors.28,29 This highlights the importance of these hydrogen bonds but underlines that there are different ways that inhibitors can favorably make interactions with the catalytic residues. The molecule also forms two hydrogen bonds with the flap region of the active site, and the flap conformation is essentially identical to the flap-closed conformation adopted in published structures of the potent peptide-based inhibitor OM992.28 Additionally, the flap residue, Tyr71, forms two edge-face stacking interactions with the phenyl rings of the inhibitor which lie within the S1 and S2 pockets. The inhibitor adopts a `collapsed' conformation in which one of the N-propyl groups packs against a phenyl ring (see Figure 1). These groups then form a continuous surface that fills the large hydrophobic S1 and S3 pocket(s) of the enzyme, and this appears to be another key region for BACE-1 inhibition. This knowledge of how substrate-like inhibitors bind to the enzyme was an insightful guide for the structure-based optimization of nonpeptidic fragment hits described below. In the preceding article in this journal we outlined how fragment screening using protein-ligand X-ray crystallography

had identified a series of ligands that bound to the catalytic aspartic acid residues in the active site of BACE-1 through an amidine or aminopyridine motif. This type of charged bidentate interaction has not previously been described between inhibitor molecules and aspartyl protease enzymes. Using this finding as a starting point, virtual screening of related molecules identified a number of attractive fragments for structure-based optimization. The syntheses of aminopyridine analogues, the biological activity, and the protein-ligand interactions made by the more potent inhibitors are outlined in this article. Results and Discussion 6-Substituted 2-Aminopyridine Inhibitors. The preceding article describes discovery of 2-aminoquinoline 1 as one ligand that binds to the active site of BACE-1. The principle interactions are between the charged aminopyridine motif and the two catalytic aspartates of the enzyme. The region adjacent to this ligand is the S1 pocket, which is a highly hydrophobic area of the active site, and was attractive to target. 2-Aminoquinoline 1 had unsuitable vectors to easily target this region of the active site. Instead, a consideration of the binding mode of fragment 1, in which the fused phenyl ring is adjacent to the S1 pocket, led us to design 6-substituted phenylethyl-2-aminopyridine 2 (Figure 2). In this design the phenyl group was predicted to make good hydrophobic contact with the S1 region. A comparison of the crystal structures of 1 and 2 indicated that the aminopyridine moiety retained the bidentate binding to the catalytic aspartic acid residues (Asp32 and Asp228) and that, as expected, the phenyl substituent occupied the S1 pocket. The structure of 2 was of low resolution,30 but this new derivative still represented a more useful starting point for further compound design than 2-aminoquinoline itself.

The next target selected was the indole-substituted aminopyridine 3 (Figure 2). This compound was designed to better occupy the S1 pocket by incorporating a larger bicyclic ring system in the hydrophobic pocket, compared with the phenylsubstituted precursor 2. The crystal structure of 3 is illustrated in Figure 2 and clearly indicates how the indole occupies the S1 region. In addition, a new interaction was observed between the indole NH and the backbone carbonyl of Gly230 on the edge of the S3 pocket. The S1 and S3 regions are contiguous in BACE-1, and the S3 pocket is again rather hydrophobic in nature. Testing of this analogue in the enzyme assay gave an IC50 ) 94 µM, indicating that the indole moiety was indeed forming favorable contacts in the S1-S3 region of the site and that this was a useful area to target in the next iteration of design. A consideration of the van der Waals contacts between 3 and the S1-S3 hydrophobic pocket suggested that larger hydrophobic groups should be tolerated in this region. A small number of derivatives were designed and synthesized, and one of the more promising analogues made was 4 in which a 3-methoxy-biaryl group replaced the indole substituent. Figure 2 shows how this group makes good contact with the active site. Notably there is a change in conformation of the flap region of the enzyme, so that Tyr71 moves and rotates above the aminopyridine ring, better accommodating the ligand. The twist out of plane of the second aromatic ring of the biaryl, relative to the indole of 3, helps improve hydrophobic contact with the pocket. Additionally, the methoxy group pendent to the biaryl moiety complements a small, more polar area by displacing a water molecule at the bottom of the S3 pocket and forms an H-bonding interaction with the backbone NH of Gly13. The potency of 4 is improved, in comparison to 3, to IC50 ) 25 µM, and this compound represented a good lead molecule for further design

and elaboration. In particular, the biaryl motif was suitable for further substitution and modification, and there were additional vectors on the aminopyridine ring itself suitable for exploration of the prime side of the active site. 3-Substituted 2-Aminopyridine Inhibitors. Virtual screening of aminopyridine derivatives from commercial sources and from the Astex compound collection identified 2,3-diaminopyridine 5 as a hit in silico. The subsequent soaking of this molecule into crystals of the enzyme indicated that binding did indeed take place (Figure 3). This is described in some detail in the sister publication. The aminopyridine again forms a charged bidentate interaction with the catalytic aspartates of the active site; however, in this case the molecule has changed orientation relative to the fragment hit 1. This new binding mode allows an additional interaction to form between the 3-amino group which donates its hydrogen atom to Asp32. This switch in orientation of the aminopyridine ring allows the N-benzyl group of the compound to occupy the S1 pocket, again demonstrating the enzyme's preference for hydrophobic binding to this pocket. This analogue 5 gave an IC50 ) 310 µM in the enzyme assay, which we considered to be promising potency for such a small fragment against this very challenging target. Using the insight we had gained from the work described above in the 6-substituted 2-aminopyridine series, a small number of biaryl substituted 2,3-diaminopyridine targets were designed to better occupy the S1-S3 hydrophobic pocket. Introduction of a 3-substituted 3-pyridyl group was found to be particularly useful because these analogues gave excellent quality protein-ligand crystal structures (Figure 3), probably due to the 3-pyridyl phenyl group forming favorable contacts with the pocket and because the pyridyl group improved aqueous solubility of these ligands. Interestingly, the pyridyl nitrogen forms an H-bond with a water molecule at the bottom of the S3 pocket in compound 6a. In the complex of 4 described earlier

(Figure 2) the methoxy group had displaced this water molecule. The potency of 6a was IC50 ) 100 µM, a reasonable improvement over the parent compound 5. Taken together these data indicated that there were profitable interactions to be made by occupying the S3 pocket and by targeting the more polar region at the bottom of this pocket. The next analogues identified contained either a methoxy group (6b) or a propyloxy group (6c) in addition to the pyridyl nitrogen atom at the meta-positions of the ring system and were designed in order to understand whether the best interactions involved displacement of the water molecule in this region, or binding to it. Figure 3 shows the complex of 6c. For this ligand, as well as in 6b, the oxygen atom of the ligand displaces the water molecule that had been targeted, and the alkyl group is positioned within the narrow opening at the bottom of the S3 pocket. The methoxy derivative 6b had an IC50 ) 40 µM and the propyloxy compound 6c an IC50 ) 24 µM, indicating that the addition of the propyloxy substituent increased affinity compared with 6a (IC50 ) 100 µM). At this point we considered analogue 6c to be a good quality lead molecule, particularly as analogues in the 2,3-diaminopyridine series benefited from a short and convenient synthesis (described later). This series was therefore prioritized over the 6-substituted 2-aminopyridines outlined earlier for the next round of compound design. Identification of a Sub-micromolar Inhibitor. Having successfully optimized the 3-substituted 2-aminopyridine series to low micromolar potency, higher molecular weight inhibitors were designed, first to better fill the S3 pocket, and second to target substituents beneath the `flap' region of the active site. The objective of this work was to establish if it was possible to identify nonpeptidic inhibitors with sub-micromolar affinity for the BACE-1 enzyme. It was rationalized that modification of the substituted pyridyl ring to a bicyclic heterocycle might better occupy the S3 pocket, and 6-indolyl was one of the modifications

LE ) - G/HAC  -RT ln(IC50)/HAC
This compares favorably with published peptide-based inhibitors28,29 that have low LE (<0.2). A ligand having a value >0.3 is consistent with identifying a compound with a molecular weight <500 Da and potency in the 10 nM range. The LE values for the compounds identified during the work described above have been added to Figures 2-4. It can be seen that the most potent compounds have LE generally in the range 0.25-0.29, just below the target value of 0.3. These values are significantly superior to known peptide-based inhibitors and would suggest that lead optimization could result in identification of potent inhibitors with an acceptable molecular weight range. Conclusions Two series of micromolar potency nonpeptidic inhibitors of BACE-1 have been successfully identified and crystallized in the enzyme active site. These two novel compound classes include a binding motif not previously observed in aspartic protease inhibitors.36 Further studies in which use of this pharmacophore has allowed identification of nanomolar inhibitors will be the subject of future publications. Experimental Section
Crystallography. Recombinant human -secretase 1 (BACE1), residues 14-453, was produced in bacteria as inclusion bodies and refolded using a method described previously.27 Crystals of apo BACE-1 suitable for ligand soaking were obtained by a procedure described by Patel et al.27 In brief, BACE-1 was bufferexchanged into 20 mM Tris (pH 8.2), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT and concentrated to 8 mg/mL. DMSO (3% v/v) was added to the protein prior to crystallization. Apo BACE-1 crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. Protein was mixed with an equal volume of mother liquor containing 20-22.5% (w/v) PEG 5000 monomethylethyl (MME), 200 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.6), and 200 mM ammonium iodide. Crystals were cryoprotected for data collection by brief immersion in 30% PEG 5000 MME, 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.6), 200 mM ammonium iodide, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. For inhibitor soaking, 0.5-0.1 M DMSO stock solutions were made. A tenfold dilution of the compound stock solution in a stabilization solution (33% (w/v) PEG 5000 monomethylethyl (MME), 110 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.6), and 220 mM ammonium iodide) was made. Crystals were added to the soaking solution for up to 6 h prior to flash freezing and data collection. Data were collected at a number of synchrotron beam lines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. All data sets were processed with MOSFLM37 and scaled using SCALA.38 Structure solution and initial refinement of the protein-ligand complexes were carried out by our automated scripts using a modified apo BACE-1 structure (PDB id code 1w50) as a starting model. Bound ligands were automatically identified and fitted into Fo - Fc electron density using AutoSolve39 and further refined using automated scripts followed by rounds of rebuilding in AstexViewer240 and refinement using Refmac.41 Data collection and refinement statistics for crystal structures are presented in Table 1. BACE-1 Assays. Activity of BACE-1 was measured using the peptide R-E(EDANS)-E-V-N-L-*D-A-E-F-K(DABCYL)-R-OH from Bachem. Assays were carried out in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, 10% DMSO, in 96-well black, flat bottomed Cliniplates in a final assay volume of 100 µL. Compounds were preincubated with inhouse produced BACE-1, and the reaction was initiated by adding 10 µM peptide substrate. The reaction rate was monitored at room temperature on a Fluoroskan Ascent platereader with excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 530 nm, respectively. Initial reaction rates were measured, and IC50s were calculated from replicate curves using GraphPad Prizm software.

chosen to probe this question. Figure 4 illustrates the binding mode of this derivative 7 to BACE-1. Compared with the biarylcontaining inhibitors 6a-c, the phenyl ring of this ligand sits higher in the S1 pocket, and there is a small rotation of the 2,3diaminopyridine moiety, but without causing any disruption of its interactions with the two catalytic aspartates. The indolyl group sits in S3 as expected and forms a new interaction between the NH of the heterocycle and the backbone carbonyl of Gly230. This compound had an affinity of IC50 ) 9.1 µM.31 The position of the phenyl ring suggested that the ortho-position, adjacent to the methylene linking the ring to the 2,3-diaminopyridine, might be a useful vector to explore substitution under the `flap' toward the S2 region. It has been observed that piperidine-based inhibitors of renin are capable of binding groups in a similar region, whereupon a significant protein conformational change occurs, opening a large hydrophobic pocket.32-34 To this end, two compounds were synthesized in which a benzyloxy (8a) or a 2-pyridinylmethyloxy group (8b) was added (Figure 4). These compounds had affinities of IC50 ) 0.69 µM (8a) and 4.2 µM (8b), respectively. The benzyloxy compound was not sufficiently soluble to afford a high quality crystal structure; however, the pyridyl-containing 8b did give a useful complex. The new substituent does not effect a significant protein conformational change and occupies the S2 pocket of the enzyme as expected, making hydrophobic contact and forming a hydrogen bond between the side chain NH of Trp76 and the pyridyl nitrogen atom. The 2,3-diaminopyridine and phenylindolyl groups bind in an identical fashion to compound 7. It is likely that the sub-micromolar inhibitor 8a adopts a similar overall binding mode. Ligand Efficiency. In the previous publication in this issue the ligand efficiencies (LE) of the aminopyridine-containing fragments discovered using high throughput crystallography were described. Aminoquinoline 1 has an estimated LE ) 0.33 according to Hopkins's formula:35

Compounds that fluoresced under the conditions described above were assayed in an alternative assay. BACE-1 activity was measured using a FRET-based substrate supplied by PanVera (kit P2985). Assays were carried out in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (provided with kit), 5% DMSO in 96-well black, flat-bottomed 1/2 area Costar plates in a final assay volume of 50 µL. Compounds were preincubated as above for 5 min with in-house-produced BACE-1, and the reaction was initiated by adding 0.25 µM peptide substrate. The reaction rate was monitored at room temperature on a SpectraMax Gemini XS platereader (Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 545 and 595 nm, respectively. Initial reaction rates were measured, and IC50s were calculated as described above. Modeling. Docking experiments were used to predict the binding mode of designed aminopyridines and to select compounds for synthesis. The aminoquinoline and aminoisoquinoline BACE-1 structures described in the previous paper were selected to dock the ligands. For each structure, a number of binding sites were constructed. Each of them contained the catalytic region (Asp32 and Asp228) with both Asp residues in the ionized state, the flap residues potentially involved in the binding of the ligands (Val69, Pro70, Tyr71, Thr72, and Trp76), and finally one of the following combinations of adjacent pockets: S1, S1 plus S3, S2 plus S1 and a large binding site constituted by S1, S1, S2, and S3. All dockings were run on a Linux cluster using Goldscore scoring functions within the Astex web-based docking facilities.42 Methods and settings have been previously described by Verdonk et al.43 Chemistry. Reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analytical separations were conducted with E. Merck silica gel F-254 plates of 0.25 mm thickness and were visualized with UV light (254 nM) or I2. Flash chromatography was performed using E. Merck silica gel. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in the deuterated solvents specified on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million () from the tetramethylsilane resonance in the indicated solvent (TMS: 0.0 ppm). Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (br ) broad, s ) singlet, d ) doublet, t ) triplet, m ) multiplet), coupling constants (Hz), integration. Compound purity and mass spectra were determined by a Waters Fractionlynx/Micromass ZQ LC/MS platform using the positive electrospray ionization technique (+ES) using a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid.
