The interactions of rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with NAD+ and with its fluorescent derivative 1, N6-etheno-adenine dinucleotide were investigated using a variety of spectroscopic methods. These techniques included: difference spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence and circular polarized luminescence. It was found that the greatest structural change in the protein tetramer occurs upon binding of the first mole of coenzyme. We have also demonstrated that progressive structural changes occur at the adenine subsite in the NAD + binding site as a function of ooenzyme saturation. These oonformational changes are probably responsible for the progressive decrease in the affinity towards the coenzyme. It was also found that every NAD + molecule induces the same conformational change of the nicotinamide subsite. These results offer a molecular explanation for the negative co-operativity in the binding of the coenzyme, without a change in the catalytic power of the NAD+ site as a function of coenzyme saturation. These results also offer a new explanation for the fact that enzyme exhibits half-of-the-sites reactivity towards certain ligands and full-site reactivity towards others. It is suggested that those ligands interacting at the adenine subsite of the NAD+ binding site imZuce the half-of-thesites reactivity. Our results support the view that both the negative co-operativity in coenzyme binding and half-of-the-sites reactivity are due to ligand-induced conformational changes on an a priori symmetric glyceraldohyde-3-phosphate dohydrogonase molecule.

1. Introduction
Glyceraldhyde-3-phosphate metabolism and therefore dehydrogenase occupies a key position in the energy

The understanding structure and subunit interactions has brought already deeper insight into its role in the control of glycolysis (Furfine & Velick, 1965; Conway & Koshland, 1968; Bloch et al., 1971). Some of the molecular properties of the mammalian enzyme such as the negatively co-operative binding of the coenzyme NAD+ (Conway & Koshland, 1968; DeVijlder & Hater, 1968) and its half-of-the-sites reactivity towards substrate acylation (Malhorta t Bernhard, 1968; MacQuarrie & Bernhard, 1971) are important control mechanisms common to many regulatory systems (Levitzki et al., 1971).

Conway & Koshland observed (1968) that rabbit muscle GPDHT binds NAD+ in a highly negatively co-operative manner. This finding was confirmed by numerous investigators. In their original observations, Conway & Koshland found that the changes of the enzyme conformation as revealed by SH reactivity and viscosity follows a sequential mechanism in which the largest conformational change in the a priori symmetric tetramer occurs upon the binding of the first NAD+ molecule. Seydoux et al. (1973), on the other hand, interpret the binding data of NAD+ and half-of-the-sites reactivity differently. They claim that both the negative cooperativity in NAD+ binding and the half-of-the-sites reactivity towards furylacryloyl phosphate is due to an a priori asymmetric tetramer with two classesof binding sites. In this paper an attempt is made to obtain some new insight into the molecular events occurring in the enzyme tetramer upon NAD+ binding and upon the binding of its fluorescent analog ENAD (Barrio et al., 1972). ENAD can substitute for NAD+ in the GPDH-catalyzed reaction as well as in the reaction of a number of other dehydrogenases(Barrio et al., 1972). ENAD therefore serves as a useful spectroscopic probe for the NAD+ binding site in dehydrogenases.Since in GPDH the consecutive intrinsic affinity constants towards NAD + and, as is shown in this paper, also towards ENAD, differ by more than one order of magnitude, one can investigate in detail the clean species E(NAD+ ), and E(cNAD),, where n = 1,2,3,4. Using a variety of spectroscopic methods to investigate these complexes, we have been able to understand more fully the molecular events occurring in the GPDH tetramer upon coenzyme binding.

2. Materials

and Methods

(a) Synthesis and purr~fication of ENAD The fluorescent NAD+ analog ENAD was prepared according to Barrio et al. (1972). The product was further purified on a DEAE-cellulose column using O-1 M-f0rI.k acid as an eluent. This procedure removed a yellowish fluorescent contaminant which comprised 4% of the product. The purified CNAD was chromatographically clean as judged by thinlayer chromatography on cellulose sheets (Riedel de Haen AG, Suelze, Hanover) using isobutyric acid/NH,OH/water (`75: 1: 24, by vol.). The purified CNAD has an absorption spectrum identical to that published by Barrio et al. (1972), possessing an extinction coefficient of 10,200 at 266.5 nm at pH 7.0. The fluorescence lifetime of the ENAD in 0.05 MHEPES, 0.01 M-EDTA is 4 ns (A. Grinwald, unpublished observations). (b) Clyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Rabbit muscle GPDH was obtained from Boehringer and Soehne (Mannheim, Germany). Enzyme preparations prepared by the method of Ferdinand (1964) have identical properties to the Boehringer preparation as far as the reactivity of active site SH groups and the spectroscopic properties described in this work. Enzyme activity was determined according to Ferdinand (1964). (c) Apoglycerctldehyde-3-phosphate ApoGPDH was prepared by treating viously treated with HCl, 0.2 M-EDTA

The fluorescence emitted from a chiral chromophore is partially circularly polarized (Steinberg, 1973). In proteins the chiral chromophore can either be a tyrosine residue or a tryptophan residue embedded in an asymmetric environment or a small ligand bound to an asymmetric pocket. This circular polarization of luminescence is related to the molecular conformation of the excited state in the same way that circular dichroism is related to the molecular conformation in the ground state. This technique has proved to be extremely powerful (Steinberg, 1973) since the chromophores observed are only the fluorescent ones whereas in the o.d. measurement many absorbing chromophores contribute to the signal. Measurement of the c.p.1. of tyrosines and trytophans has proved to be a very powerful tool to investigate protein structure (Sohlessinger & Steinberg, unpublished results). Circular polarised luminescence was measured with an instrument built in the Department of Chemical Physics by Steinberg and Gafni as described elsewhere (Steinberg & Gafni, 19'72). The modification of the instrument for measurements in the U.V. region will be desoribed elsewhere (Schlessinger & Steinberg, unpublished results). The spectral resolution for the exitation beam was 30 nm and for the fluorescent beam 15 nm. All measurements were conducted at 24°C. Circular polarised luminescence was measured using cells with an optical path of 1 mm which enabled us to use high protein

concentrations. 3. Results (a) Binding

FIG. 1. Spectroscopic properties of ENAD binding sites as a function of the number of ENAD bound per tetramer. All measurements were carried out at pH 7.5 in 0.05 M-HEPES, 0.01 M-EDTA at room temperature (24°C) using high protein concentrations (2.0 x lo- 4 M-tetramer). Under these conditions 3.6 ENAD molecules bind stoichiometrically because of the high affinity towards the coenzyme. (a) Absorption measurements. The absorption spectra of GPDH(<NAD), to GPDH(ENAD)~ were measured using protein concentration of 1.8 x lo-* M-tetramer.

When apoenzyme concentrations of 5x low5 Mtetramer are used one can titrate the protein with ENAD and determine the third and fourth binding constants for ENAD (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The first and second moles of ENAD bind very tightly (Fig. 2) to apoGPDH and therefore the determination of their exact affinity is inaccessible experimentally. It, is, however, clear that the aflinity of the enzyme towards the first two moles of

ENAD is much higher than lo6 M-~ (Pig. 2). Since the binding constants for the third and fourth .&KD+ molecules are similar in value to those for NAD+ (Table l), it is reasonable to assume that the analogy extends to the first and second moles too.

Circular polarized luminescence measures fluorescence anisotropy (g,,), namely the asymmetry of the ENAD site when the ligand is in the excited state. The c.p.1. spectrum changes as a function of the number of ENAD molecules bound to the protein tetramer (Fig. 1). The fluorescence anisotropy factor (g,,) is highest in E(cNAD),, decreases dramatically in E(eNAD),, and vanishescompletely in E(cNAD), and E(eNAD), (Fig. 1).

The changes in the protein c.p.1. spectra as a function of the number of NAD+ molecules bound is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the change in g,, as a function of NAD+ saturation is wavelength dependent (Figs 5 and 6). It should be stressedthat c.p.1. spectra monitors selectively the changes in tryptophan residues and tyrosine residuessince only the latter are fluorescent. Other chromophores which absorb in the same region of the U.V. spectrum (Tyr, S-S bonds) and contribute to the c.d. signal do not contribute to the c.p.1. signal. (f) Fluorescence

This enabled us to work at high protein concentrations (5-55x low5 M, seeFig. 6) and inspect the clean speciesE(NAD+), through E(NAD+),. Al so, no correction for NAD' absorption was required since the latter has no absorbance at 307 nm. The degree of fluorescence quenching by bound NAD+ decreasesprogressively from n = 1 to n = 4 (Fig. 6). 87

FIG. 6. (a) "Blue" and "red" tryptophans in apoGPDH. Apoenzyme (0.6 mg/ml) in HEPES/EDTA buffer in a 2.5-mm fluorescence cell was excited at 280 nm and at 305 nm. GPDH fluorescence depends on the excitation wavelength. This indicates the existence of both red and blue tryptophans. (b) Circular polarised luminescence of GPDH as a function of bound NAD + . GPDH(NAD)l to GPDH(NAD)4 complexes were analyzed by c.p.1. of the protein. The protein concentration in these experiments was 5 x 10-s M. The complexes E(NAD),, E(NAD)s and E(NAD)s were prepared by adding the appropriate amounts of NAD +. This is experimentally feasible because of between these the high affinity constants (K1-lO1l, Ks-10s, Ks-10s) for NAD + . The separation constants allows one to obtain a clean population of each species without intermixing.

This effect is manifested very clearly by plotting the degree of fluorescence quenching (B) versus the degree of saturation Y (Fig. 7). It can be seen that the shape of the response curve describing the fluorescence quenching as a function of NAD+ saturation is wavelength dependent (Fig. 6). This phenomenon is also manifested in the i? versus P plot (Fig. 7). The changes in the protein fluorescence anisotropy factor, g,,, as a function of NAD+ binding are also wavelength dependent as is shown in the previous section. These observations indicate that the three tryptophan residues per subunit (Harris, 1970) differ in their fhlorescence properties and respond differently to NAD+ binding. Direct evidence for the heterogeneity among the three tryptophan residues was obtained when the protein fluorescence was excited at two different wavelengths (Fig. 5). When the protein fluorescence is excited at 305 nm, the fluorescence spectrum is red-shifted as comapred to the fluorescence spectrum obtained

ENZYME-COENZYME

when the protein is excited at 280 nm. These observations prove that both (ked" and "blue" tryptophans exist in GPDH. Those tryptophans whose fluorescence is redshifted are embedded in a more polar environment, whereas those emitting at shorter wavelength are embedded in a more hydrophobic environment.

of every spectroscopic property characteristic to this band is a linear function of NAD+ saturation. In this study we found that both the fluorescence quenching at 390 nm and the c.p.1. changesat 390 nm are linear with NAD + binding (Figs 5 and 6). Since every protein subunit contains three tryptophans (Harris, 1970) it is very likely that a homogeneous population of "red" tryptophans is either directly quenched by the "Racker band" (the "Racker band", E= 3500 M-l cm-l at 360 nm per bound NAD+, DeVijlder & Slater, 1968), or indirectly due to local conformational changes. The linear increase of the c.p.1. signal at 390 nm upon NAD+ saturation (Fig. 6) indicates that the "red" tryptophan(s) are not totally quenched and that the asymmetry in their environment increasesas a function of NAD + saturation. In conclusion, the type of interactions at the nicotinamide subsite are independent of NAD+ saturation and the conformational changes at the nicotinamide subsite occur according to a simple sequential model, in each subunit independently. We can therefore conclude that the structure of the holoenzyme at the catalytic end of the NAD+ binding site remains constant in E(NAD), through E(NAD),. This is in accordance with the finding that k,,, per site is independent of NAD+ saturation (Teipel & Koshland, 1970). All these observations strongly indicate that the negative co-operativity in coenzyme binding is not due to structural changesat the nicotinamide subsites. (b) Structure of the adenine subsiteand its relation to the negative co-operativity The binding of ENAD to the GPDH NAD+ binding site produces a chromophore which absorbs in the visible range (Pig. 1). The extinction coefficient and quantum yield of this chromophore are independent of the number of NAD+ sites occupied by the fluorescent ligand ENAD (Fig. 1; Table 2). GPDH bound ENAD exhibits fluorescence emission maximum and quantum yield identical to that of ENAD in 80% dioxane in water (Figs 3 and 4). This finding indicates that the ENAD+ binding site is rather apolar. These spectroscopic properties of bound ENAD are independent of the number ENAD molecules bound to the GPDH tetramer. When other spectroscopic tools, more sensitive to subtle conformational changes at the NAD + binding site are used, one does observe dramatic changesat the NAD + binding site as a function of the tetramer saturation. The ENAD-enzyme chromophore exhibits strong optical activity in the ground state as is revealed by the cd. spectra (Fig. 1). The nature of the cd. spectrum is highly dependent on the number

558

A. LEVITZKI

of ENAD molecules bound to the enzyme. This observation demonstrates that the nature of the interactions between the adenine moiety and the protein changes as a function of tetramer saturation. This fact is manifested even more dramatically by the optical activity of the bound ENAD in the excited state as is measured by c.p.1. (Fig. 1). When only one NAD+ site is occupied by ENAD the highest g,, value is observed. The value of g,, decreasessubstantially upon binding of the second ENAD molecule. The optical activity in the excited state of the bound ENAD vanishes completely in the E(cNAD), and the E(eNAD), species. Again one can safely conclude that the structure of the NAD+ binding site in E(NAD),, at the adenine end, changes continuously as a function of n.

coenzyme which induces conformational changes share of the total conformational change. Upon of holoGPDH is formed.

These findings may point to the molecular events occurring in GPDH upon ooenzyme binding, and which account for the negative co-operativity in its binding (Fig. 10). The binding of the first coenzyme molecule induces a structural change at the adenine subsite. This structural change then triggers other structural changes in the protein tetramer (see below), which are transmitted to the vacant adenine subsites. These changes at the vacant adenine subsitesbring about a decrease the in binding affinity towards the second coenzyme moleoule. The binding of the second and third coenzyme molecule bring about further changes at the remaining vacant NAD+ sites, leading to a progressive decreasein the affinity towards the coenzyme. Other explanations for the heterogeneity in coenzyme binding rely on the hypothesis that the enzyme possess two classes NAD+ binding sites (MacQuarrie & Bernhard, of 1971), where the GPDH molecule is constructed from two conformationally distinct subunits. Such a model would imply that the fkst two coenzyme molecules would bind with equal affinity and that the third and fourth molecules would also bind with lower but equal affinity. Furthermore, a model assumingtwo classes coenzyme of binding sites would predict identical spectroscopic properties for E(coenzyme), and E(coenzyme), and equal contributions due to the binding of the third and fourth coenzyme molecules. Direct binding measurements for both NAD+ and ENAD (Table 1) demonstrate that the binding curve must be fitted with at least three if not four binding constants.

ENZYME-COENZYME

INTERACTIONS

559

Furthermore, the intrinsic spectroscopic properties of E(coenzyme),, E(coenzyme),, E(coenzyme), and E(ooenzyme), differ from each other indicating that the binding of each coenzyme molecule induces its share of the total conformational change in the GPDH molecule. Perrin plots constructed from fluorescence polarization measurements on the E(cNAD), show that the adenine moiety of ENAD is immobile in the bound state since its limiting fluorescence anisotropy r0 is identical to that of free ENAD at -50°C (Figs 8 and 9; Table 3). Upon bin.ding of the second and third ENAD molecules to the enzyme tetramer the slope of the Perrin plots change only slightly, whereas the limiting anisotropy decreases substantially. This indicates that the hydrodynamic properties of the GPDH tetramer change only slightly. The decrease in r,, in enzyme species containing more than one ENAD is probably due to energy transfer among bound ENAD molecules.
(c) Structural changes in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenme protein

Quenching of the protein fluorescence by NAD+ binding reveals some interesting properties of the molecule. When the total fluorescence yield (quantum yield) of the protein is followed as a function of NAD+ binding, a non-linear dependence of the extent of quenching on NAD+ occupancy is observed (Figs 6 and 7). The binding of the first NAD+ molecule induces the largest quenching, whereas subsequent binding to the rest of the coenzyme sites contribute progressively less to the total quenching. When the reactivity of the active site SH groups is followed as a function of bound NAD + , one also finds that the greatest change occurs upon binding of the first NAD' molecule (Conway & Koshland, 1968). When one follows the degree of quenching at different wavelengths, the following results are obtained (Figs 6 and 7). (a) At 390 nm ("red" tryptophans) the degree of quenching of protein fluorescence bound NAD+ is directly proportional to the extent of binding; (70) 330 nm ("blue " at tryptophans) the degree of quenching is not constant per NAD+ bound where the largest contribution to the total quenching is induced by the first NAD+ bound. This behavior is similar to the dependenceof the total fluorescence quenching of the protein as a function of bound NAD + . The c.p.1. of the GPDH tetramer monitors the optical activity of all three tryptophans per enzyme subunit (Harris, 1970)and therefore representstheir weighted sum. In the region of 305 nm the c.p.1. monitors the optical activit.y of both "blue" tryptophans and tyrosines at the excited state. In this region the changes of g,, induced by NAD+ binding doesnot behave according to a simple sequential scheme. On the other hand, at 390 nm a linear increasein g,, asa function of NAD + occupancy is observed (Figs 5 and 6). The linear increase of the o.p.1. signal at 390 nm correspondsto the linear fluorescence quenching at 390 nm (Figs 6 and 7). Two alternative explanations can be offered for this phenomenon. (a) NAD+ causesonly partial fluorescence quenching of a single "red" tryptophan at the nicotinamide subsite, accompanied by a large increase in its g,,. Since this change is not transmitted to other subunits, it occurs linearly with NAD+ saturation. (b) The nicotinamide subsite possesses "red" two tryptophans, only one of which is quenched by NAD+ binding. Upon quenching of one "red" tryptophan, the contribution of the second,unaltered tryptophan, to the c.p.1. signal, increases.Again, since this change is not transmitted to other subunits, it occurs linearly with NAD+ binding. Both explanations rely on the assumption

that the "blue" tryptophans have a negligible contribution to the c.p.1. signal at 390 mu. Indeed, one finds (Fig. 5) that g,, at 320 nm is tenfold smaller than g,, at 390 nm. The changes in g,, values of the other typtophans and tyrosines, monitored at shorter wavelengths, reflect structural changes in the protein tetramer, which occur at areas remote from the nicotinamide end of the NAD+ binding site. The existence of "red" and "blue" tryptophans is directly demonstrated by the red-shift in the protein fluorescence spectrum when excited at higher wavelengths (Pig. 5). The invariance of the g,, at 330 nm (Fig. 5) may be due to the fact that the absolute value of g,, at this wavelength is very small and therefore changes in its value are within experimental error. (d) Half-of-the-sites reactivity

The results reported in this paper may explain why GPDH with bound NAD+ possesses half-of-the-sites reactivity towards active site acylation by certain acylating agents such as furylacryloyl phosphate (Malhorta & Bernhard, 1968) and full-site reactivity towards the substrate 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (Harrigan & Trentham, 1971): as long as the acylating reagent interacts with the ooenzyme binding site only at the region of the nicotinamide subsite, conformational changes are not transmitted to other subsites and therefore full-site reactivity is observed. Acylating molecules such as furyl-2-acryloyl phosphate are also aromatic in nature and thus may interact at the adenine region of the NAD+ binding site. Interactions at the adenine subsite are transmitted to other subunits and therefore active-site acylation of half of the available SH groups may switch off completely the remaining two SH groups towards this aromatic acylating agent. It is interesting that when the active site SH groups of apoGPDH are alkylated, one observes half-of-the-sites reactivity only towards certain aromatic alkylating agents and full-site reactivity towards other reagents (Levitzki, 1973). As in the case of active-site acylation in the holoenzyme, the type of interactions between the alkyl group and the NAD+ binding site probably determines whether all the sites or only half of them will be expressed. It seems that when strong interactions occur at the adenine subsite, half-of-the-sites reactivity results and when the interactions occur at other regions of the NAD+ binding site, full-site reactivity occurs. In conclusion, the GPDH molecule seems to be a symmetric tetrahedral molecule both in the holoenzyme state (Btihner et al., 1973) and the apoenzyme state. Upon covalent binding of ligands to the active site SH groups, an asymmetrical tetrameric structure may result, depending on the nature of the bound ligand. X-ray crystallographic data of Watson et al. (1972), indeed suggest a perturbation in the 2 :2: 2 symmetry pattern of human holoGPDH to which mercurials are bound to the active site SH groups. Our spectroscopic data support strongly the idea that the structural transitions which occur in GPDH uponNAD + binding are sequential, where the largest structural change occurs upon binding of the first NAD + molecule to the protein tetramer. The nicotinamide subsite remains unchanged as a function of NAD+ saturation, whereas dramatic structural changes occur at the adenine subsite. The changes at the adenine subsite are transmitted to other subunits, thereby decreasing the affinity towards further coenzyme binding leading to negative co-operativity.
