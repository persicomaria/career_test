One-state Downhill versus Conventional Protein Folding

MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, MRC Centre Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK Classical protein folding invokes a cooperative transition between distinct thermodynamic states that are individually populated at equilibrium and separated by an energy barrier. It has been proposed, however, that the small protein, BBL, undergoes one-step downhill folding whereby it folds non-cooperatively to its native state without encountering an appreciable energy barrier. Only a single conformational ensemble is populated under given conditions, and so the denatured state ensemble progressively changes into the native structure. A wide dispersion of thermal denaturation midpoints that was observed for an extrinsically labelled fragment of BBL is proposed to be evidence for its one-state, downhill folding, a phenomenon that is also suggested to be functionally important for BBL and its homologues. We found, however, that thermal denaturation of unlabelled wild-type BBL was highly cooperative, with very similar transition midpoints for the melting of secondary and tertiary interactions, as well as for individual residues when monitored by NMR. Similar results were also observed for two other homologues, E3BD and POB. Further, the extrinsic fluorophores perturbed the unfolding energetics of labelled BBL, and complicated its equilibrium behaviour. One-step downhill folding may well occur for some proteins that do not have distinct folded states but not for BBL and its well-folded homologues.

Downhill folding Downhill folding of proteins is an intriguing phenomenon that energy landscape theory predicts might occur under conditions where the native ensemble is energetically highly favourable.1 The extreme energetic bias tilts the energy landscape toward the native basin and sufficiently lowers the barrier height for folding until it is comparable to that of thermally induced motions. Folding is then characterized by a diffusive, downhill passage across the energy landscape without encountering a significant energy barrier. But, importantly, the

protein reverts to classical two-state folding, with a barrier-limited transition, as the bias towards the native state is lessened at higher temperatures (such as near the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition). In an alternative "one-state" model proposed by Munoz and co-workers,2,3 it is proposed that downhill behaviour persists throughout the unfolding transition, so that the denatured state gradually merges into the native state as conditions are changed, and only one structural ensemble is populated at each temperature. Thus, in the Munoz model, gradually raising the temperature would result in a protein inter-converting from its native to its denatured state in the absence of a co-operative, all-or-none transition.4 In principle, one-state folding offers the exciting possibility of performing complete characterisations of protein folding pathways using only spectroscopic techniques at equilibrium, abrogating the need for extensive kinetic studies and computer simulations.

296 Recently, Munoz and co-workers reported that a double fluorescently labelled derivative of BBL,5 an all-helical bacterial protein, displayed one-state, downhill folding.2 They suggested that downhill folding could be functionally important to BBL and other homologues of the peripheral subunit binding domains because their structural properties would be tuned by changes in cellular conditions or temperatures. The evidence for one-state, downhill folding was obtained from measuring the apparent thermal denaturation midpoints (Tm) of a BBL fragment that was labelled at the N and C termini with the extrinsic fluorophores, 1-napthyl-alanine and dansyl-lysine, respectively. The Tms were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence emission from the dansyllysine group, far-UV circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and

reported to span a wide temperature range (from 295­335 K). This was interpreted as evidence for non co-operative structure formation as a function of temperature and, therefore, evidence for onestate, downhill folding of BBL.1

Cooperative thermal denaturation of peripheral subunit binding domain homologues We examined the equilibrium thermal denaturation properties of unlabelled BBL, E3BD and POB, homologues from mesophilic, thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic bacteria, respectively, to see whether they folded cooperatively, or downhill as recently proposed.2 We determined the structures of the three proteins, which had essentially superimposable three-dimensional structures (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Top: Superimposition of the solution structures of BBL (1w4h), E3BD F166W (1w4e) and POB L146A Y166W (1w4j) in green, red and blue ribbons, respectively (N.F., T.D.S., P.J.S., M.D. Allen, C.M. Johnson & A.R.F., unpublished results). The overall fold is a three-helix bundle with two main helices at the N and C termini (helix I and II, respectively). These helices are joined by a flexible loop that contains a 310 helix. This Figure was generated using PyMol (http:// pymol.sourceforge.net). Bottom: Sequence alignment of E3BD F166W, POB L146A Y166W and wild-type BBL. Grey boxes and bold text indicate similar residues. To facilitate comparison, we have adopted a standard numbering scheme for these three homologues based on the original numbering for E3BD by Mande.20 Accordingly, the sequence for E3BD F166W runs from N126-G170, wild-type BBL from Q126-K169 and POB L146A Y166W from R127-A175.

297 probed, therefore, the temperature-dependent changes in the secondary, tertiary and global structure of these homologues. We also used 13C NMR measurements to monitor the environments of Ca and Cb groups for individual residues during thermal denaturation of BBL (Figure 3). The transition midpoints (Tm), and midpoint enthalpies of denaturation (DHm), were very similar for each protein when measured by these techniques (Table 1). The small differences that we observed were most likely a consequence of curve fitting uncertainties, experimental inaccuracies and minor temperature variations between different instruments. However, it is possible that the small discrepancies observed in measurements of POB L146A Y166W and wild-type BBL could be due to temperature-dependent, structural changes in the denatured ensemble. The sequences of BBL and POB L146A Y166W were predicted from the program AGADIR1s6 to have a high propensity to form a-helical structure in the denatured state, which was consistent with preliminary NMR experiments (unpublished data). Our data showed that the secondary and tertiary structure of wild-type BBL, E3BD F166W and POB

The following constructs were used: wild-type BBL (pdb 1w4h); an engineered mutant of E3BD (F166W, pdb 1w4e) that has an essentially identical structure and stability to the wild-type protein (1ebd) but contains a tryptophan residue as a spectral probe; and a destabilised tryptophan-containing POB variant (L146A Y166W, pdb 1w4j) that has an essentially identical solution structure to the wildtype protein and a more amenable thermal transition. Thermal denaturation of unlabelled BBL, E3BD F166W and POB L146A Y166W was measured using 1 H-NMR, 13C-NMR, far-UV CD, near-UV CD and UV absorbance spectroscopy, in conjunction with DSC measurements (Figures 2 and 3). Far-UV CD measures the chirality of the peptide bond, and, for the BBL family, reports mainly on the a-helical secondary structure. Near-UV probes the chiral environment of aromatic residues, making it an excellent probe of tertiary structure. DSC measures the heat (enthalpy) required to break the noncovalent interactions that stabilise the native conformation during thermal unfolding. 1H-NMR can be used to monitor the environment a given proton of an amino acid, thus probing both local and non-local interactions. Our experiments

Denaturation was monitored using DSC, under the same buffer conditions as used in the thermal denaturation experiments described above. Buffer baselines were subtracted from each dataset and normalised with respect to protein concentration. The endotherms are offset to make the post-transition baseline coincide with that of E3BD F166W to facilitate comparison. The pre-transition baselines for each homologue exhibited very similar, weak temperature dependencies, in contrast to earlier measurements on labelled BBL.2

Figure 3. Thermal denaturation of wild-type BBL measured by 13C filtered NMR experiments21 under identical conditions to those of Figure 2(b). The chemical shifts of the Ca or Cb groups of various residues were measured as a function of temperature for the following residues (a) Ca of R136, (b) Cb of L139, (c) Cb of N143, (d) Ca of I149, (e) Ca of E161, (f) Ca of E164. These residues report on different parts of the BBL structure and probe the denaturation of both local and non-local interactions. Thermal denaturation of wildtype BBL was essentially coincidental for each residue (Table 1), as expected for a co-operative transition. These data were fitted to twostate transitions, as per Figure 2.

L146A Y166W melted cooperatively under these conditions. Further, we found that thermal denaturation of BBL, when monitored at the level of individual residues, was still cooperative and the parameters calculated were in good agreement with those determined by other methods (Table 1). We found no evidence for the large spread of transition midpoints previously reported (295­335 K). 2 Thermal denaturation of wild-type unlabelled BBL, E3BD F166W and POB L146A Y166W satisfies standard criteria for apparent two-state transitions, namely coincident values for transition midpoints and DHm when measured by different techniques, and a ratio of close to unity between the van't Hoff and calorimetric enthalpies of denaturation.7

BBL labelled with extrinsic fluorophores behaved anomalously In order to establish the origins of the differences

in behaviour between unlabelled, wild-type BBL and that previously reported for the labelled peptide,2 we synthesised the extrinsically labelled construct (residues 130­168). This synthesised construct lacks the QNND sequence present at the N terminus of the unlabelled, wild-type BBL construct that we used (residues 126­169). However, these additional residues have been shown previously,5 and by us (pdb code 1w4h, N.F., T.D.S., P.J.S., M. D. Allen, C. M. Johnson & A.R.F, unpublished results), to be completely unstructured and solvent-exposed in the solution structure of BBL. We found that introducing napthyl-alanine and dansyl-lysine fluorophores into BBL, combined with its shortened boundaries, changed its equilibrium properties compared to the unlabelled wild-type material. The labelled peptide reproducibly exhibited a less cooperative chemical denaturation transition, and a steeper pre-transition baseline, than did the unlabelled protein (Figure 4(a)). Under identical conditions, the labelled peptide had a significantly

Essentially identical results were observed for wild-type E3BD and E3BD F166W. a These values represent the standard error of the mean from replicate measurements when thermal denaturation data were fitted to two-state transitions.19 b Owing to instrumental limitations, thermal denaturation measurements were only made between 298 and 371 K. Thus, the pretransition baselines were less well defined in these absorbance experiments compared to the other techniques used. This may account for the small inaccuracies in the DHm values reported here. c A DHcal/DHVH ratio of close to unity is strongly indicative of two-state thermal denaturation. d Similar values were obtained using other 1H resonances (the E3BD Y138 Hd and the POB L146A Y166W E169 Hg#). The large fitting errors are most probably due to curve fitting uncertainties that arise from the restricted number of data points and difficulties in determining in the slopes of the pre- and post-transition baselines. e The errors shown are those determined from curve fitting. The high cost of preparing 13C, 15N-labelled BBL, and the prolonged triple resonance experiments, precluded us making replicate measurements. The experimental uncertainties in determining the temperature calibration curve, combined with the low data density, make it likely that the true errors are slightly larger than reported here.

lower value DHm compared with the wild-type protein that we used (Figure 4(b)). The perturbing effects of the extrinsic labels are unsurprising given that they significantly increase the hydrophobicity of BBL compared with the unlabelled construct. It was evident in a revised solution structure of BBL (pdb code 1w4h, N.F., T.D.S., P.J.S., M. D. Allen, C. M. Johnson & A.R.F, unpublished results) that the Nterminal alanine, which was modified to napthylalanine in the labelled mutant, forms the edge of the hydrophobic core. The free energy of denaturation (DGD­N) of wildtype, unlabelled BBL at 298 K was w2.3 kcal/mol in both thermal and chemical denaturation experiments, consistent with these denatured ensembles being thermodynamically equivalent. In contrast, there was significant disagreement between the apparent DGD­N values of labelled BBL in chemical and thermal denaturation experiments, when these data were fitted to two-state transitions (DGD­NZ 4.3 kcal/mol and 1.5 kcal/mol, respectively). These stability changes suggest that one or both of the extrinsic labels may interact with the protein, and these interactions perturb the relative energies of the chemically and thermally denatured ensembles. This may explain the steep pre-transition baseline that we observed in replicate chemical denaturant titrations of labelled BBL, that were absent in measurements of unlabelled protein.

The DSC experiments previously reported for labelled BBL2 have a strongly temperature-dependent pre-transition baseline that displays larger changes in heat capacity than the main unfolding endotherm. These changes in heat capacity for the pre-transition baseline were assumed to reflect temperature-dependent changes in structure and were used as evidence for non-cooperative thermal denaturation.2 But, we found that the extrinsically labelled peptide had a strong tendency to aggregate above 325 K at the higher concentrations necessary to measure low enthalpy endotherms by DSC. In our experiments, the pre-transition baselines for both labelled (data not shown) and unlabelled BBL (Figure 4(c)) displayed only a weak temperaturedependence in DSC measurements. Further, the absolute heat capacity and enthalpy for thermal unfolding of unlabelled BBL were significantly larger than those reported for labelled material2 (Figure 4(c)). The published data for labelled BBL2 are inconsistent with those for other similar sized proteins.8­12

Comparison of the denaturation parameters of wild-type BBL (residues 126­169) and a BBL peptide (residues 130­168) with the N and C-terminal residues extrinsically labelled with napthyl-alanine and dansyllysine groups, respectively. Top: Chemical denaturation of wild-type BBL (black circles) and the labelled BBL derivative (grey circles) at 298 K and pH 7.0 measured by far-UV CD spectroscopy at 222 nm. Each dataset is normalised relative to the signal in the absence of chemical denaturants. The pre-transition baseline of labelled BBL is steeper than that of unlabelled material. Similar effects were noted when these datasets were normalised relative to the signal in 7 M guanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, normalisation artefacts do not produce this apparent behaviour. Middle: Thermal denaturation of wild-type and extrinsically labelled BBL. Wild-type (black circles) and the labelled BBL peptide (grey circles) measured by far-UV CD spectroscopy at 222 nm. The labelled BBL peptide had a higher Tm and a lower enthalpy of unfolding than the wild-type protein.

that it denatured conventionally, without any evidence for one-state, downhill folding.2,3 Similarly, we also found that E3BD F166W and POB L146A Y166W, homologues of BBL, had cooperative thermal denaturation transitions. These results are in contrast to the earlier evidence for downhill folding and its proposed functional importance in BBL and homologous proteins.2 We found that introduction of extrinsic fluorophores into BBL perturbed its free energy of unfolding, altered the relative population of conformational ensemble in the energy landscape and caused aggregation. Although fluorescent labels are suitable probes when attached to relatively rigid structures, they may seriously perturb dynamic ensembles of structures, such as denatured states, because of hydrophobic interactions that may alter equilibria and facilitate aggregation. This is even more likely to become an issue in proteins, such as BBL, that have an intrinsic propensity for significant residual structure in the denatured ensemble. There are examples of barrier-less unfolding for proteins that do not have a conventional native structure. The thermodynamics of denaturation of the molten globules of apomyoglobin13 and alactalbumin14 are consistent with a second-order phase transition,15 which is analogous to the onestate folding model. The compact denatured ensembles of the Drosophila melanogaster Engrailed homeodomain, and a destabilised mutant thereof, populate compact states akin to a folding intermediate, and undergo apparent second-order unfolding transitions.16 A criterion for proteins to fold to a conventional native structure, rather than occupy a molten-globule type state, is the presence of a low-lying energy state.17,18 Perhaps one-state folding will be associated with molten globules rather than with stably folded proteins. However, it is possible that there will be some crossing of these boundaries as this lowest energy level becomes less distinct, as in destabilised, small domains or designed peptides.

and NMR measurements. The data for labelled BBL are transcribed from Garcia-Mira et al.2 We were unable to obtain complete endotherms by DSC for this peptide due to its reduced unfolding enthalpy and aggregation tendencies compared with unlabelled material.
