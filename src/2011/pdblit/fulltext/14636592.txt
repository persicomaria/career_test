Kinesins are molecular motors that power cell division and transport of various proteins and organelles. Their motor activity is driven by ATP hydrolysis and depends on interactions with microtubule tracks. Essential steps in kinesin movement rely on controlled alternate binding to and detaching from the microtubules. The conformational changes in the kinesin motors induced by nucleotide and microtubule binding are coordinated by structural elements within their motor domains. Loop L11 of the kinesin motor domain interacts with the microtubule and is implicated in both microtubule binding and sensing nucleotide bound to the active site of kinesin. Consistent with its proposed role as a microtubule sensor, loop L11 is rarely seen in crystal structures of unattached kinesins. Here, we report four structures of a regulated plant kinesin, the kinesin-like calmodulin binding protein (KCBP), determined by X-ray crystallography. Although all structures reveal the kinesin motor in the ATP-like conformation, its loop L11 is observed in different conformational states, both ordered and disordered. When structured, loop L11 adds three additional helical turns to the N-terminal part of the following helix a4. Although interactions with protein neighbors in the crystal support the ordering of loop L11, its observed conformation suggests the conformation for loop L11 in the microtubule-bound kinesin. Variations in the positions of other features of these kinesins were observed. A critical regulatory element of this kinesin, the calmodulin binding helix positioned at the C-terminus of the motor domain, is thought to confer negative regulation of KCBP. Calmodulin binds to this helix and inserts itself between the motor and the microtubule. Comparison of five independent structures of KCBP shows that the positioning of the calmodulin binding helix is not decided by crystal packing forces but is determined by the conformational state of the motor. The observed variations in the position of the calmodulin binding helix fit the regulatory mechanism previously proposed for this kinesin motor. Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Kinesins are molecular motors utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis to walk and to pull their cargos along the microtubule track (Vale and Milligan, 2000). During the nucleotide hydrolysis cycle, kinesins undergo conformational changes that affect both their attachment to microtubules and the intramolecular arrangement of the mechanical parts of kinesin, the motor head and the neck (Rice et al., 1999). These rearrangements result in directed step-by-step motion (Mori et al., 2007) of the kinesin along the microtubule. Structural elements of kinesins termed ``switches" respond to different nucleotide states of the motor. The switch I loop L9 and the switch II cluster comprised of helices a4, a5 and loops L11 and L12 are the nucleotide sensing elements of the kinesin motor

(Kull et al., 1996; Sablin et al., 1996). Loop L11, helix a4, and loop L12 of switch II also constitute the main microtubule-binding site on the surface of the kinesin motor (Sosa et al., 1997; Kikkawa et al., 2000; Marx et al., 2006; Brier et al., 2006). Structural and mutational data suggest that depending on its nucleotide state, kinesin adjusts the position of the switch II helix a4 relative to the motor core. Transmitted through the structure of the motor core, this conformational change triggers movement of a transmission-like element, the neck linker, which is proposed to be a key event in the process of the kinesin force generation and motion (Kull et al., 1996; Vale and Milligan, 2000). The crystal structures of the plus end kinesin KIF1A revealed the distinct positions of the switch II helix a4 in different nucleotide bound states of the motor (Kikkawa et al., 2001; Nitta et al., 2004). These positions of helix a4 in the ATP-like and ADP-bound structures of KIF1A were proposed to define the nucleotide-induced conformations of the switch II helix in all kinesins. In the absence of microtubules, little free energy is associated with coupling

of the bound nucleotide to the protein conformation. Therefore, if the nucleotide binding pocket is occupied by ADP but the position of helix a4 is ATP-like, the conformation of the kinesin motor is regarded as the ATP-like (Vale and Milligan, 2000; Sablin and Fletterick, 2001). Mutational analysis and subfamily residues conservations prove that loop L11 is an important element of the switch II cluster. However, this loop is disordered in crystal structures of 17 different kinesins. Structuring of loop L11 was suggested to take place when the kinesin motor binds to the microtubule (Sosa et al., 1997; Marx et al., 2006). Consistent with this idea, ordered loop L11 was observed in electron micrographs of conventional kinesin bound to microtubules in the nucleotide-free state (Sindelar et al., 2002). In the absence of microtubules, loop L11 is flexible, and only a few crystal structures revealed loop L11 to be ordered (Song et al., 2001; Nitta et al., 2004; Yun et al., 2001; Sablin et al., 1996). Ordering of loop L11 often results in extending of the N-terminus of helix a4 following loop L11. However, it remains unclear how the conformations of loop L11 observed in the crystal structures are related to the nucleotide state of the kinesin motor. Here we report four crystal structures of the kinesin-14 motor, kinesin-like calmodulin binding protein (KCBP),1 obtained from two different crystal forms. KCBPs form a unique group of kinesins that feature the regulation of their microtubule binding properties by calmodulin (Reddy et al., 1996; Song et al., 1997; Reddy and Reddy, 2002). The regulatory calmodulin binding domain is adjacent to the C-terminus of the KCBP motor domain (Reddy et al., 1996; Narasimhulu and Reddy, 1998). Binding of the Ca2+-activated calmodulin to KCBP causes the motor to dissociate from microtubules (Deavours et al., 1998). In a similar way the microtubule binding of KCBP is controlled by the recently discovered calcium binding protein KIC containing a single EF-hand motif (Reddy et al., 2004). Previous atomic resolution crystal structure of KCBP revealed how the calmodulin binding domain is organized and positioned relative to the motor core (Vinogradova et al., 2004). Based on this finding, a mechanism of Ca2+-activated calmodulin regulation was proposed for the KCBP motor (Vinogradova et al., 2004). The newly solved structures of KCBP described in this paper demonstrate the dynamic character of regulatory structural elements such as loop L11 and the calmodulin binding helix and support the previously proposed regulatory mechanism. Elongation of the switch II helix due to ordering of loop L11, observed here in one of the KCBP structures, has never been seen before in the crystal structures of kinesins in the ATP-like conformation. Based on comparative structural analysis, we suggest that the observed ordering of loop L11 in the crystal structures of KCBP and a few other kinesin motors in the absence of microtubules is due to fortuitous crystal packing interactions rather than a particular nucleotide state of the kinesin motor. Combined data presented in this work suggest that the observed structured configuration of L11 might represent the conformation for this loop in the microtubule bound kinesin. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Preparation of recombinant KCBP A cDNA fragment encoding the potato KCBP from amino acids 884­1252, which included the motor core (a.a. 884­1208) and the C-terminal extension (a.a. 1209­1252) containing the calmod1 Abbreviations used: KCBP, kinesin-like calmodulin binding protein; Ncd, nonclaret disjunctional kinesin motor; Kar3, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-related protein; AMPPCP, b,c-methyleneadenosine-50 -triphosphate; AMPPNP, 50 -adenylylimidodiphosphate; ADP-Vi, (50 -adenylyl-diphospate)-vanadate; ADP-AlFx, aluminofluoride complexes of ADP.

ulin-binding motif (a.a. 1221­1236), was cloned into the pET28b vector (Novagen) as described (Vinogradova et al., 2004). The recombinant KCBP was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen), and purified using Calmodulin­Sepharose4B (Amersham Biosciences) affinity chromatography as described (Reddy et al., 1996; Deavours et al., 1998). The purified protein (in the buffer containing 50 mM TRIS, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM TCEP) was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and used fresh for crystallization experiments. 2.2. Crystallization and data collection The purified KCBP protein was crystallized under conditions similar to ones described previously (Vinogradova et al., 2004) (Table 1). Two different crystal forms were obtained at +20° C and at +4° C using the vapor diffusion method. Before data collection, crystals were cryo-protected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. 15% PEG400 in the reservoir solution was used as a cryo-protectant. X-ray data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory) beamline 8.3.1. (k = 1.1 Å). The X-ray diffraction data were processed using DENZO and scaled by SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). 2.3. Structure determination, model building and refinement The structures of KCBP from two different crystal forms were determined by molecular replacement (CNS (Brunger et al., 1998)) using atomic coordinates for the previously solved structure of KCBP motor domain (PDB ID 1SDM). The models were built

and refined using the CNS software alternating with manual rebuilding steps using QUANTA (Accelrys) until the refinement converged (Table 1). There are two KCBP molecules in the asymmetric unit of each of the two crystal forms; each KCBP molecule was built and refined independently. Therefore, four independently solved structures of KCBP were generated. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structures of potato KCBP determined using new crystal forms Two new crystal forms of KCBP were obtained under conditions similar to those published previously (Vinogradova et al., 2004). The previous crystals were of the orthorhombic space group P21212, with one molecule of KCBP per asymmetric unit (PDB ID 1SDM). The new crystals (I and II, Table 1) are of the orthorhombic space group P212121, differ in unit cell dimensions, and have two molecules of KCBP in the asymmetric unit in addition to different lattice symmetry. For both crystal forms, each of the two KCBP molecules was built and refined independently, resulting in four individually solved structures of the KCBP motor domain. The current models of KCBP are refined to 2.2 Å (crystal form I) and 2.9 Å (crystal form II) with R/Rfree values of 0.228/0.267 and 0.271/0.285. The model built using the crystal form I consists of two polypeptide chains, A and B, containing KCBP residues 887­ 1233, 1245­1252 and 887­1123, 1138­1231, 1244­1252, 2 ADP molecules, 2 Mg ions and 215 molecules of water. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under ID code 3COB. The model built using the crystal form II consists of two polypeptide chains, A and C, containing KCBP residues 889­925, 928­1078, 1085­1121, 1140­1240, 1246­1252 and 887­911, 915­925, 930­1076, 1080­1123, 1140­1237, 1245­1252, 2 ADP molecules, 2 Mg ions and 50 molecules of water. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under ID code 3CNZ. The breaks in the polypeptide chains correspond to weak electron density. The four new structures of KCBP were aligned using the conserved P-loop (a.a. 970­977), which remains unaltered during the nucleotide hydrolysis cycle, and then compared with the previously solved structure of KCBP (1SDM). The superposed KCBP structures look very similar, except for small variations in the positions of the calmodulin binding helix (Fig. 1A, highlighted in blue, pink, orange and red for the new KCBP structures, also Fig. 1 of Supplementary on-line material). Similar to the previously determined structure of KCBP, the structures derived from the new crystal forms reveal the kinesin motor domain in the ATP-like conformation as judged by the position of the switch II cluster relative to the rest of the motor core. However, electron density maps show that the nucleotide-binding pockets in all new KCBP structures contain ADP. In both the old and new structures, the segment termed the ``neck mimic" (Vinogradova et al., 2004) (Fig. 1A) follows the same path along the motor head, stabilizing the ATP-like conformation of KCBP similarly to the true neck of the N-terminal kinesins. The neck mimic is located at the C-terminus of the motor core and is proposed to be a general feature of C-terminal kinesin motors (Vinogradova et al., 2004). In the case of KCBP, it is also a part of the regulatory machinery that connects the motor core to the calmodulin binding helix (Fig. 1A). None of the structures of KCBP derived from the new crystal forms reveal a fully ordered loop connecting the calmodulin binding helix with another KCBP specific element, a microtubule mimic termed ``negative coil" (Fig. 1A) (Vinogradova et al., 2004). The amino acid sequence corresponding to the negative coil is abundant with negatively charged residues and thus mimics the negatively charged C-terminus of tubulin that binds to the kinesin

motors. The specific positioning of the negative coil on the microtubule binding face of the KCBP motor domain (in the vicinity of loop L8) is expected to generate electrostatic repulsion between the motor and the microtubule and is suggested to be controlled by calmodulin (Vinogradova et al., 2004). 3.2. Variations in the position of the calmodulin binding helix The position of the calmodulin binding helix that follows the neck mimic is determined by multiple electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that hold both the entire neck mimic and the first N-terminal turn of the following helix docked along the motor core (Vinogradova et al., 2004) (Fig. 2). Certain rotational freedom was predicted for the calmodulin binding helix based on analysis of the first structure of KCBP (Vinogradova et al., 2004). The new structures of the motor demonstrate rotational and positional deviations for this regulatory helix. In the KCBP structures described here, the positions of calmodulin binding helix are distributed in a fan shape of 30° arc. In each case, the exact orientation of the helix relative to the motor core is influenced by intermolecular packing contacts formed within the crystal lattice. However, the positioning of the N-terminus of the calmodulin-binding helix depends only on the position of the neck mimic, which is almost identical in all KCBP structures (Fig. 1A). Regardless of the angular deviations of the calmodulin binding helix, in all KCBP structures, the microtubule mimicking negative coil following the calmodulin binding helix is positioned on the microtubule binding face of the motor. 3.3. Mechanism of regulation of KCBP by calmodulin The new structures of KCBP confirm the previously described positions of the calmodulin binding helix and the following negative coil relative to the motor core. Positioning of these regulatory elements at the microtubule binding face of the motor suggested a model for calmodulin-controlled regulation of the KCBP function (Vinogradova et al., 2004). According to this model, binding of Ca2+-activated calmodulin to the regulatory helix would sterically block the microtubule binding sites of KCBP, preventing the motor from attaching to the microtubule. The fan-shaped distribution for the calmodulin binding helix suggests that this flexibility may be important for that function of KCBP. Comparative analysis of all KCBP structures shows that the described positioning and orientation of the calmodulin binding helix is achieved through specific arrangements of supporting structural elements of this motor protein, in particular by docking of the preceding neck mimic along the motor core (Figs. 1A and 2). Since docking of the neck mimic is coupled to the nucleotide-dependent movement of the switch II cluster (Vinogradova et al., 2004), the regulation of KCBP by calmodulin is tied to the nucleotide hydrolysis cycle and the nucleotide state of the motor. The five individually solved structures of KCBP analyzed in this study demonstrate that the positioning of the calmodulin binding helix is not decided by crystal packing forces but is determined by the conformational state of the motor and therefore is related to the motor's function. 3.4. New conformation of loop L11 The new structures of KCBP contribute to our understanding of yet another regulatory element of kinesin motors, switch II loop L11. In the absence of microtubules, this loop is flexible and, therefore, not visible in most structures of kinesins, regardless of their type, conformational state or bound nucleotide (Table 2). We observe loop L11 in an unusual conformation, fully ordered in one of the new structures of KCBP (highlighted in pink and indicated in Fig. 1B). In this structure, the loop L11 residues 1117­1130 from

the ordered coil segment are followed by three a-helical turns. The a-helical part of loop L11 merges into the switch II helix a4 elongating its N-terminal part. The resulting helix is comprised of 25 amino acid residues and has a bent shape (a4 bends at residue

Asn1140). The newly ordered part of helix a4 (a.a. 1131­1139) is in agreement with secondary structure prediction expecting Asn1131 to start uninterrupted helix a4 (Rost et al., 2004). Analysis of the ordered conformation of loop L11 shows that residues Asn1131, Leu1133, Lys1134, and Gln1137 from its helical segment and residues Lys1124 and Ser1126 from its coil segment interact with the crystal symmetry molecules (Fig. 3). Almost 600 Å2 of the surface area contributed by loop L11 is buried at the interface formed by the crystal contacts. The intermolecular contacts formed by L11 are supported by weak hydrophobic inter-

The helix a4 is considered elongated if it exceeds the average length plus the value of the standard deviation. The length of the helix a4 averaged over all kinesins structures published to date is 17.7 + 3.5 amino acids. Thus, a helix formed from 22 amino acids and more is considered elongated. a The assignments for either ATP-like or ADP-like conformational states were made by comparing the positions of the switch II helices a4 and a5 in the structure of the kinesin motors to the position of their counterparts in the structures of KIF1A in ADP-bound state (PDB ID 1I5S) and AMPPCP-bound state (PDB ID 1I6I), respectively.

The tip of the loop consisting of four amino acid residues (Gly1127, Ser1128, Ala1129 and Gly1130) is the most flexible part of loop L11 that makes no crystal symmetry contacts. The new conformation of loop L11 is also stabilized by internal interactions, mostly hydrophobic by their nature. Residues Ala1136 and Ile1139 from its helical segment and residues Val1123, Lys1125 from its coil segment (Fig. 3) form strong hydrophobic cluster interactions. Thus, both internal and intermolecular interactions stabilize the conformation of loop L11and may be responsible for the bent shape of the helix a4. 3.5. Comparison of loop L11 in KCBP and other kinesin structures Conformational rearrangements and the related dynamic structure of switch II loop L11 are thought to be an important part of the nucleotide-induced conformational changes in kinesin motors (Sablin et al., 1996; Nitta et al., 2004). Based on comparative analysis of available kinesin structures (Table 2), the length of the following switch II helix a4 depends on the configuration of the preceding loop L11, which when ordered, can elongate helix a4 at the N-terminus. According to the secondary structure predictions, helix a4 is expected to be comprised of 25 amino acid residues. However, its length varies from 14 to 28 residues in available kinesin structures (Table 2). These structures show that, in the absence of microtubules, the length of the switch II helix does not depend on the nature of the bound nucleotide: the elongated helix a4 has been observed in the structures of kinesin with no nucleotide in the pocket (Shipley et al., 2004), in kinesins bound by ADP (Gulick et al., 1998; Turner et al., 2001; Kikkawa et al., 2001; Yun et al., 2001) or by transition-state analog ADP-Vanadate (Nitta et al., 2004) (Table 2). Nevertheless, in all cases the switch II cluster containing the elongated helix a4 assumed the ADP-like conformation (Table 2). It should be noted that ordering of loop L11 does not always result in the elongation of helix a4. In several kinesin structures

loop L11 is observed as a random coil (human conventional kinesin 1BG2 (Kull et al., 1996)), or with one or few helical turns inserted into the coil structure (fast kinesin 1GOJ (Song et al., 2001)). However, the ordering of loop L11 in these structures is not relevant to one particular conformational state of the motor (Table 2). All five structures of KCBP show the kinesin motor in the ATPlike conformation. Furthermore, in one KCBP structure the switch II loop L11 adopts a fully ordered conformation elongating the following switch II helix by three turns. This structural finding demonstrates for the first time that the elongation of a4 can also take place in the ATP-like conformational state of the motor. As we discussed earlier, the observed ordered conformation of loop L11 in the structure of KCBP is stabilized by crystal contacts. Therefore, ordering of the loop L11 in this case was not induced by binding of nucleotide but caused by fortuitous crystal lattice packing. We analyzed other structures of kinesin motors with ordered loop L11. Noteworthy, in all these crystal structures the ordering of loop L11 segments takes place on the surface of the contacts with neighboring molecules in the crystals (Fig. 2 and Supplementary online material, Fig. 2). Since ordered loop L11 and extended helix a4 are observed for the kinesin motors bound by different nucleotides and in different conformational states, we suggest that variations in the conformation of switch II loop L11 in the crystal structures originate from specific crystallization conditions, crystal lattice and associated crystal packing rather than from the bound nucleotide or conformational state of the motor. It is known that the crystal packing interaction may sometimes mimic the physiological environment. While the conformation of loop L11 is stabilized by non-physiological contacts in the crystal structures, similar ordering may take place on microtubules where the loop can be stabilized by specific interactions with tubulin residues. Remarkably, the extension of the N-terminal part of switch II helix a4 due to rearrangement of the preceding loop L11 was detected in the high-resolution electron microscopy images of nucleotide-free conventional kinesin and was shown to be induced by binding of the motor to the microtubule (Sindelar and Downing,

2007). The extra density that can possibly belong to the extension of the switch II helix a4 was seen in the electron microscopy images of the AMPPNP bound KIF1A (Fig. 3D in Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006). Although the analogous ordering of loop L11 and elongation of a4 have not been detected in electron-microscopy studies of other kinesins (Hirose et al., 2006), it is possible that loop L11 remains ordered and elongated helix a4 attached to the microtubule during different stages of the nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis cycle. Electron microscopy studies of kinesin motor KIF1A (Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006) showed that switch II helix a4 stays fixed on the microtubules during the nucleotide exchange while the rest of the motor core rotates. Accordingly, the helical segment of loop L11 as a part of switch II helix may keep the same contacts with microtubules. In this case, the flexible coil of L11 would ensure the dynamic link with the preceding structural elements of the motor core. High-resolution electron microscopy images of kinesins bound to the microtubule show that contacts made by the motor switch II helix a4 and loop L11 occur at the intradimer interface between a- and b-tubulin subunits of the microtubule (Sosa et al., 1997; Marx et al., 2006; Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006). Modeling experiments show that the extended helix a4 observed in the KCBP structure fits well into the groove between the a- and b-tubulin subunits of the microtubule. Based on this observation and combined data presented in this study, we suggest that the ordered conformation of loop L11 and related elongation of helix a4 observed in the structure of KCBP are functionally relevant. We expect that these new atomic resolution molecular details will be useful for structural analysis of kinesin motors when high-resolution electron microscopy images of the microtubules-bound kinesins in different nucleotide states become available. In summary, the new structure of KCBP demonstrates the elongated switch II helix a4 seen here for the first time for the kinesin motor crystallized in the ATP-like conformation. Our analysis of the available crystal structures of this and other kinesin motors show that ordering of loop L11 in the crystal structures results from the crystal contacts interactions. However, we speculate that the conformation of the elongated switch II helix a4 may be physiologically relevant and represent the microtubule-bound conformation.
