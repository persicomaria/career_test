Iron plays a vital role in all live organisms, and Entamoeba hisfofyfica is not an excspbon. This human protozoan parasite has some proteins that contain iron as part of their structure. such as fsrradoxin and suparoxidedisrmrhase Patmanic microorganisms living inside a host have evolved spedal mechanisms to capture iron from iron-containing proteins of their host; receptors to iron proteins and sidemphoras allow bacterial pathogens to take iron and multiply. Recently. we have demonstrated that E. hisfolyfica tmphozoitas are abte to grow in human hemoglobin as a sole iron sourc=?,and reported three cystaikproteasas degrading this iron-protein. These proteases could be involved in the iron uptake by the protozoan (Exp Parasitol, In Press, lW8). In the present work,we present evidences that this parasite binds transferrin and expresses a polypaptide in the abarvnr%ofiron. MatJmds. Trophozoitas of E. hisfdytica HMl:IMSS were grcwn 72 h in Diamond medium. and Chelex-100 resin was usad to remove iron from the medium. Iron concentration was maasurad by the farrozine method in both medium and trophozoile axtracts. Ferric citrate or ferrous sulfate wars tasted to grow. SDSPAGE of extracts obtained by freeze-thawing in reducing conditions. ware used for showing an amebic protein expressed in low iron and for detecting the protein which recognized iranskrdn. Fluoresceinated streptavidin-biotin transfarrin was used to show the binding to transferrfn. Results. E. histo/ytica trophozoites required iron addition to the basal culture medium since iron traces from the reagents did not support thaw growth and they dii in 3-4 subcultures. The minimal iron wncentration for gro&g was 40 pi ancb cliies Ihowe o@rlalgron%in sxlQ)ii.

On the other hand, a 120 kDa polypeptiie was observed in tmphozoite axtracts incubated in the presence of iron-charged human transferrin. and fluorescanca patches around the tmphozoite surface wars observed when amoebas were imxbatad with Fa-transfenin, Conctulorta. Taken together, the rasults show that iron could play an important rcJa tn amoeba virulanm and pathogenesis.
