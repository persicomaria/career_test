The serine proteinase plasmin is, together with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), involved in the dissolution of blood clots in a ®brin-dependent manner. Moreover, plasmin plays a key role in a variety of other activation cascades such as the activation of metalloproteinases, and has also been implicated in wound healing, pathogen invasion, cancer invasion and metastasis. The leech-derived (Hirudo medicinalis) antistasin-type inhibitor bdellastasin represents a speci®c inhibitor of trypsin and plasmin and thus offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the concept of plasmin inhibition. The complexes formed between bdellastasin and bovine as well as porcine b-trypsin have been crystallised in a monoclinic and a tetragonal crystal form, containing six molecules and one molecule per asymmetric unit, Ê respectively. Both structures have been solved and re®ned to 3.3 A and Ê resolution. Bdellastasin turns out to have an antistasin-like fold 2.8 A exhibiting a bis-domainal structure like the tissue kallikrein inhibitor hirustasin. The interaction between bdellastasin and trypsin is restricted to the C-terminal subdomain of bdellastasin, particularly to its primary binding loop, comprising residues Asp30-Glu38. The reactive site of bdellastasin differs from other antistasin-type inhibitors of trypsin-like proteinases, exhibiting a lysine residue instead of an arginine residue at P1. A model of the bdellastasin-microplasmin complex has been created based on the X-ray structures. Our modelling studies indicate that both trypsin and microplasmin recognise bdellastasin by interactions which are characteristic for canonically binding proteinase inhibitors. On the basis of our three-dimensional structures, and in comparison with the tissue-kallikrein-bound and free hirustasin and the antistasin structures, we postulate that the binding of the inhibitors toward trypsin and plasmin is accompanied by a switch of the primary binding loop segment P5-P3. Moreover, in the factor Xa inhibitor antistasin, the core of the molecule would prevent an equivalent rotation of the P3 residue, making exosite interactions of antistasin with factor Xa imperative. Furthermore, Arg32 of antistasin would clash with Arg175 of plasmin, thus impairing a favourable antistasin-plasmin interaction and explaining its speci®city.

Bdellastasin-Trypsin Complex Structures

Introduction
Haemostasis is the delicate balance between the processes of coagulation, anticoagulation and ®brinolysis. The ®brinolytic system consists of an activation cascade that is mainly involved in the dissolution of blood clots (Vassalli et al., 1991). It has recently become apparent, however, that the components of this system also have a role in cell migration. These processes include wound healing, tissue remodelling, angiogenesis and embryogenesis (Chandler, 1996; Chapman, 1997; Lottenberg, 1997). A crucial event in the ®brinolytic cascade is the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasminogen is secreted in the liver as a single chain 790 amino acid residue protein, which circulates in the plasma at a high concentration (2 mM) as two different Glu-plasminogen glycoforms. It contains a preactivation peptide followed by ®ve kringle domains and a C-terminal trypsin-like catalytic domain. This domain exhibits a high degree of sequence homology with other plasma and pancreatic trypsin-like serine proteinases and an open active-site cleft similar to that of trypsin and chymotrypsin (Parry et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1998). The structural similarity permits the use of the chymotrypsinogen numbering system (so that the active site residues Ser195, His57 and Asp102 correspond to Ser741, His603 and Asp646 of plasminogen, respectively). The physiological plasminogen activators, tissuetype plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinasetype plasminogen activator (uPA), activate plasminogen by limited proteolysis at the Arg15(561)Val16(562) bond to the broad-speci®city serine proteinase plasmin. Furthermore, invasive human pathogens produce plasminogen activators, such as streptokinase and staphylokinase, which are not enzymes themselves but form 1:1 complexes with plasminogen and plasmin, respectively (Madison, 1994). These complexes acquire a remarkable speci®city to activate plasminogen (Bock et al., 1996; Lottenberg, 1997). Microplasmin (m-plasmin) is a truncated form of plasminogen consisting of a 20-residue A-chain connected by two disulphide bridges to the catalytically active 229-residue B-chain. Plasmin degrades ®brin(ogen), but is also capable of cleaving other components of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, plasmin plays a key role in a variety of other activation cascades such as in the activation of metalloproteinases, pathogen invasion, cancer invasion and metastasis (Chapman, 1997). Because of its pivotal role, plasmin represents an attractive target for inhibition therapy. The activity of plasmin in the plasma and in the interstitial ¯uid is normally held in check by the endogenous protein a2-macroglobulin and by È the serpin a2-antiplasmin (Dano et al., 1985; Mayer, 1990); therapeutically, it could be balanced by the haematophage-derived antistasin-type inhibitors È hirustasin (Sollner et al., 1994) and bdellastasin

(Moser et al., 1998), isolated from the medical leech Hirudo medicinalis. Antistasin is a small, disulphide cross-linked, 119-amino acid protein with anticoagulant and antimetastatic properties. Its primary structure reveals a 2-fold internal repeat, indicating that it has evolved by a gene duplication event (Han et al., 1989; Nutt et al., 1988). Antistasin showed no close sequence similarity with any other known proteinase inhibitor and thus became the prototype of a novel family (Nutt et al., 1988), characterised by a nearly strict conservation of the spacing of ten cysteine residues (Jung et al., 1995). Several members of this family have been characterised: guamerin from the Korean leech Hirudo nipponia (Jung et al., 1995), guamerin II, extracted from the nonblood-sucking leech Whitmania edentula (Kim et al., 1996), and gelin, isolated from Hirudinaria manillensis (Electricwala et al., 1993). All of them have been described as chymotrypsin and elastase-like inhibitors, while the ghilantens from the salivary glands of the Amazonian leech Haementeria ghilianii (Blankenship et al., 1990; Brankamp et al., 1990; È Condra et al., 1989), and hirustasin (Sollner et al., 1994) and bdellastasin (Moser et al., 1998) from the medical leech H. medicinalis have been characterised to possess anti-trypsin activity. Bdellastasin is a 59-amino acid, cysteine-rich inhibitor toward sperm acrosin, plasmin and trypsin (Fritz et al., 1971; Fritz & Krejci, 1976), and has recently been expressed in high yield in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Moser et al., 1998). The inhibitor shows 29.8 % and 28.7 % sequence homology to the ®rst and the second domain of antistasin, respectively, but exhibits quite high overall sequence identities with hirustasin (54.5 %) and guamerin (44.0 %). The reactive site has been located to Lys34-Val35. Due to its Lys-P1 residue, bdellastasin differs from other trypsin-speci®c members of the antistasin family, which exhibit an arginine residue (nomenclature by Schechter & Berger (1967)). Bdellastasin is found to tightly bind and inhibit trypsin in the nanomolar range (Ki  1.0 nM). Native as well as recombinant bdellastasin inhibit plasmin with Ki values of 24 nM and 12 nM, respectively, but has virtually no inhibition activity against any other serine proteinase of the blood coagulation and the ®brinolytic cascade (Moser et al., 1998). Here, the three-dimensional structures of bdellastasin in complex with bovine and porcine trypsin (E.C. 3.4.21.4) are described. To investigate the mechanism of action of bdellastasin and the atomic details of its interaction with m-plasmin, we initiated modelling studies, based on the bdellastasin-trypsin and the ternary microplasmin-staphylokinase-microplasmin complex structures (Parry et al., 1998).

95 Ê are within hydrogen-bond distance (2.9 A and Ê ) to the hydrogen-bond donors Ser147 N and 3.3 A Ser146 N, respectively. Furthermore, Ias115 Og2 is linked with Thr144 O through the two hydrogenbonded water molecules Wat10 and Wat43, Leu114 Ê O interacts with Lys145 Nz (3.2 A), and Ser116 Og is water-connected with Ser146 Og. These crystal contacts would also be possible for D-Asp, but are even better for L-isoaspartate at position 115. It is noteworthy that in the porcine trypsin-LDTI complex (Di Marco & Priestle, 1997), where the unit cell and the crystallisation parameters are comparable, residue 115 has been re®ned as an D-aspartic acid. It is thus tempting to speculate that the formation of this crystal form is somewhat associated with the deamidation and racemisation of L-Asn115 to D-Asp115 and is particularly favoured for the isomerised product L-isoaspartate. Description of the bdellastasin structure Bdellastasin is a cysteine-rich serine proteinase inhibitor. In the best de®ned bovine trypsin-bdellastasin complex D-U, the bdellastasin chain is de®ned in the ®nal Fourier map from amino acid residues Thr7 to Gln59. For the six N-terminal residues, the electron density is too weak to locate their positions with con®dence. The 53 de®ned residues fold into a brick-shaped structure with Ê Ê Ê overall dimensions 40 A Â 20 A Â 10 A, which can be subdivided into an N-terminal (residues 7-27) and a C-terminal subdomain (residues 28-59). The N and the C-terminal subdomains both constitute Ê Ê Ê thin discs with dimensions 17 A Â 13 A Â 6 A and Ê Ê Ê 26 A Â 24 A Â 7 A, respectively, with the N-terminal subdomain rotated by almost 75  along the connecting linker segment Ser29-Leu31, compared to the C-terminal subdomain. Except for three very short two-stranded antiparallel b-sheets, bdellastasin exhibits mainly nonclassi®able structure elements (Figure 2). This is in agreement with far-ultraviolet CD studies, according to which native and recombinant bdellastasin should have a low ratio of b-sheets and no a-helices (Moser et al., 1998). The overall chain geometry of the N-terminal subdomain resembles an open left-handed helix with two short antiparallel b-sheets comprising strands 8-10, 13-15 and 20-22, 25-27, each followed by a b-hairpin. While the antiparallel b-sheets are created via hydrogen-bonding, parallel running strands are covalently linked by disulphide bridges Cys10-Cys21 and Cys15-Cys26. Following the linker segment Ser29-Leu31, the primary binding loop fragment Lys34-Lys36 forms with the disulphide bridges Cys33-Cys52 and Cys37-Cys54 and also Ile53 a rigid ring-like structure. The space inside this ring is ®lled by the hydrophobic side-chains of Val35 and Phe41, which form a hydrophobic core. The third disulphide bridge Cys28-Cys48 of the C-subdomain links the b-sheet with strands 42-44 and 47-50. After the open turn formed by residues 50 and 51,

Results and Discussion
Molecular packing and intermolecular contacts in the unit cell Analysis of the molecular packing of bovine b-trypsin-bdellastasin complex (BTB) and porcine b-trypsin-bdellastasin complex (PTB) reveals that the packing patterns and the molecular contact sites are different. A distinct property of BTB are the six bovine trypsin-bdellastasin complexes per asymmetric unit, termed A to F for the trypsin and R to W for the bdellastasin molecules. Examination of the crystal packing of BTB shows that the bdellastasin molecules S, T, V, and W are in very weak contact with symmetry-related molecules and hence are held in the crystalline array only via their attachment to trypsin. As a consequence, the N and C-terminal subdomains of bdellastasin molecules S, T, V and W can move toward one another. This wagging motion of the subdomains is re¯ected by lack of electron density for the N-terminal subdomains. However, the subdomainal contact loop segment from residue 17 to 19 displays traces of electron density and therefore may act as a hinge joint. On the other hand, the N-terminal subdomains of bdellastasins R and U are sandwiched between the local symmetryrelated trypsin molecules D, F and A and the crystallographic symmetry-related molecule E. The interface is formed between Ser166 Og, Ser167 Og, Ser170 Og and Asn223 Od1 of trypsin and Pro9 O, Gly11 N, Val23 N and Asp24 Od1 of bdellastasin, respectively. This obviously makes the N-terminal subdomains of R and U rigid, which therefore can be traced in the electron density map. One interesting feature of PTB is the nature of residue 115 of porcine trypsin, which according to its sequence should be an asparagine residue. The electron density for this trypsin residue, accounting for a short side-chain and a quite long separation from the following a-carbon atom, is not in agreement with an L-Asn or L-Asp, or with an D-Asn or D-Asp, but clearly indicates the presence of a b-isomerised L-aspartic acid (Figure 1(a)). This L-isoaspartic acid presumably results from a spontaneous deamidation, accompanied by simultaneous isomerisation reaction via a ®ve-membered succinimide ring. The Fo À Fc difference map is relatively featureless for the L-isoaspartic acid, and all crystallographic and stereo-chemical parameters are acceptable. Such rearrangement in Asn-containing peptides are well known; the ratio of the hydrolysis and racemisation products L and D-isoaspartic acid and L and D-aspartic acid of a model hexapeptide Val-Tyr-Pro-Asn-Gly-Ala has been determined to be 8:3:2:1 (Geiger & Clarke, 1987), indicating a ®nal excess of L-isoaspartic acid over D-aspartic acid. In this crystal form, the L-isoaspartyl residue 115 (Ias115) juxtaposes to segment Thr144 to Gly148 of a symmetry-related molecule (Figure 1(b)), making tight crystal contacts. The side-chain oxygen atoms Ias115 Og1 and Ias115 Og2

the C-terminal segment 52-56 aligns with the reactive-site loop and ends in a curved C terminus. The interface between both subdomains is created by b-hairpins Ser16-Ala18 and Asp44-Asn47. The majority of the interface contacts are made by side-chain interactions. The methyl group of Ala18 and the hydroxy-phenyl group of Tyr50 create hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds are Ê found between Ala18 N and Asp44 Od1 (3.2 A), Ê Ser16 Og and Asn46 Od1 (3.5 A), and Glu19 Oe1 Ê and Asn46 Nd2 (3.2 A). Interaction between bdellastasin and trypsin Bovine and porcine trypsin share a high degree of structural similarity re¯ected by a 82 % sequence identity. A comparison of the bovine trypsin of the bovine trypsin-bdellastasin complex with the porcine trypsin of the porcine trypsin-bdellastasin Ê complex reveals a r.m.s. deviation of 0.56 A for all

Ê 223 Ca positions, compared with 0.1 A for all 1629 atoms for the six bovine trypsin molecules. In all seven complexes, interactions between the inhibitor and the proteinase are restricted to the C-terminal subdomain of bdellastasin, particularly to the primary binding loop (residues 30 to 38) (Figure 3). The relative orientations of the de®ned parts of bdellastasin to bovine and porcine trypsin are almost identical, with virtually no differences in the main-chain conformation within the binding loop region. The best de®ned interface between bdellastasin (I) and porcine trypsin (E) covers an Ê area of about 660 A2, thus comprising 17 % of the surface of bdellastasin. The reactive site loop of bdellastasin from Asp30(I) (P5) to Glu38(I) (P4H ) is in direct contact with trypsin and binds to its active site in a substrate-like manner, i.e. with the main-chain conformation and intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions similar as seen in other canonically

binding proteinase inhibitors (Bode & Huber, 1992). The four residues preceding the scissile peptide bond are arranged antiparallel to enzyme segment Ser214(E) to Gly216(E), forming the typical single hydrogen bond Ser214(E) O to N Lys34(I) (P1), and the hydrogen bond pair between Gly216(E) N,O and His32(I) O,N (P3). Due to a sizeable kink at Leu31(I) (P4), an additional hydrogen bond is formed between Asp30(I) O (P5) and Ê Gly219(E) N (3.6 A). In agreement with canonical binding, the Lys34(I) (P1) carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond is situated in the oxy-anion hole, ®xed via a bifurcated hydrogen bond to Gly193(E) N and Ser195(E) N, and the following three residue segment runs antiparallel to trypsin segment His40(E) to Phe41(E), forming the usually observed hydrogen bond between Lys36(I) (P2H ) N and Phe41(E) O. The side-chain of P1-Lys34(I) extends into the S1 speci®city pocket, with its distal ammonium group forming hydrogen bonds to Ser190(E) Og Ê Ê (2.8 A) and Ser190(E) O (2.9 A) and to the characÊ teristic ``buried'' solvent molecule Wat4 (2.9 A), which also mediates interaction with Asp189(E) Ê Od2 (2.8 A) at the bottom of this pocket. Similar to other related protein-inhibitor serine-proteinase complexes (Bode & Huber, 1992), the scissile peptide bond Lys34(I)-Val35(I) of the bound bdellastasin molecules seems to be intact in these trypsin complexes. The continuous electron density between Ser195(E) Og and the carbonyl C atom of Lys34(I) (P1) observed at a 1s contouring level and Ê the sub-Van der Waals distance (2.5 A) indicate g some degree of covalent O -C interaction; due to the limited resolution, the exact geometry around the carbonyl carbon atom cannot be described. The imidazole side-chain of His32(I) (P3) points toward the hydrophobic core of bdellastasin and is nearly planar to the benzene ring of Phe41(I) at a Ê distance of about 3.9 A. It is held in this position by a hydrogen-bond network between His32(I) Ne2 Ê and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Glu49(I) (3.8 A) Ê and Tyr50(I) (3.5 A), and by Glu49(I) Oe1 interact-

Ê ing with His32(I) Ne2 (3.4 A) and His32(I) Nd1 Ê (3.9 A). An interesting binding pocket exists for Lys36(I) (P2H ). This side-chain is aligned parallel with the benzene ring of Tyr151(E) at a distance of about Ê 4.0 A. As the amino group is probably positively charged, it can interact electrostatically with the electron cloud of the p-orbitals of the aromatic side-chain. Interactions between ammonium groups and aromatic groups are known to be relatively strong (Mitchell et al., 1993; Rodham et al., 1993). However, there is no counter charge within the pocket, but the amino group is in contact with several bound water molecules. Structural comparison of antistasin-type domains Bdellastasin shows a relatively strong sequence identity with hirustasin (54.5 %) and a high degree of sequence similarity to the ®rst (29.8 %) and the second domain of antistasin (28.7 %) (Moser et al., 1998). Furthermore, the alignment shown in Figure 4 indicates that all cysteine residues are conserved. Nevertheless, these antistasin-type inhibitors exhibit characteristic high proteinase speci®cities towards trypsin, plasmin, tissue kallikrein or coagulation factor Xa, respectively. Like hirustasin (Mittl et al., 1997), bdellastasin is a single-domain inhibitor, with similar shape, dimensions and relative orientation of the subunits. As expected on the basis of the sequence identity, the C-terminal subdomain of bdellastasin superimposes best with the corresponding part of tissuekallikrein bound hirustasin (residues 24-52), with Ê r.m.s. differences of 0.61 A for 29 Ca atoms. This structurally most conserved part of bdellastasin's scaffold encompasses the reactive site loop. In addition, the rest of the C-terminal subdomain (residues 28-56) superimposes well with residues 28-55 of antistasin domain I (Nc) and residues 83110 of antistasin domain II (Cc), re¯ected by the Ê small r.m.s. differences of 1.3 A for 29 Ca atoms Ê and 1.6 A for 28 Ca atoms, respectively. The better

®t with the ®rst domain is in agreement with the slightly higher sequence similarity. Up to now, in all known antistasin-type inhibitor structures the N-terminal subdomains adopt different orientations relative to their C-terminal subdomain (Figure 5(a)). The r.m.s. differences resulting from the superposition of the individual N-termÊ inal subdomains with bdellastasin are 1.2 A (19 Ca atoms of residues 5-23 of tissue kallikrein bound Ê hirustasin), 1.1 A (14 Ca atoms of residue 7-27 of the N-terminal subdomain of antistasins N-termiÊ nal domain (Nn)) and 1.2 A (14 Ca atoms of residue 56-81 of the N-terminal subdomain of the antistasin C-terminal domain (Cn)), indicating that the folds are similar (Figure 5(b)). Apart from the N-terminal residues, the highest degree of similarity is found in the core of these subdomains. Furthermore, the disulphide connectivity is consistent in all structures. These results, together with the wagging motion found for the N-terminal subdomains of the bdellastasin molecules S, T, V and W in BTB and PTB, support the idea that relatively large rigid-body motions relative to their C-termiÂ nal subdomains can take place (Uson et al., 1999). Modelling of the m -plasmin-bdellastasin complex In order to analyse possible binding modes with its target enzyme, we performed docking studies of bdellastasin (U) with the catalytic domain of plasmin (P) described as the ``enzyme'' component in the microplasmin-staphylokinase-microplasmin complex (Parry et al., 1998). The catalytic domain of m-plasmin has a similar overall structure as the prototypical serine proteinase trypsin. Its active-

site cleft is, however, more open, particularly due to a six-residue deletion between residues 94 and 101, that leads to the formation of the 94-shunt which replaces the conserved 99-b-hairpin loop of trypsin. Bdellastasin was docked with its binding loop into the active-site cleft of human m-plasmin as described in Materials and Methods. The simple superposition of the bdellastasin-trypsin complex on m-plasmin results in the collision of Ser190(P) and Ser195(P) with Lys34(U), of Gln192(P) with Val35(U), and of Leu217(P) with Leu31(U). To relax the protein-protein interface, further adjustments were explored computationally. To enable a fair comparison of the energy-minimised m-plasmin-bdellastasin complex structure with that of the trypsin-bdellastasin X-ray structure, the experimentally derived trypsin-bdellastasin interface was further subjected to MULTIDOCK V1.0 (Jackson et al., 1998), yielding only small shifts. The energyminimised complexes were compared and evaluated in terms of energies, the amount of buried surfaces and the deviation from the initial structures. The calculated residue-residue interaction energies of the interface of bdellastasin with m-plasmin and trypsin are given in Figure 6. In addition, the summed total interface interaction energy was determined to À85.57 kcal/mol and À88.97 kcal/mol for the trypsin and the m-plasminbdellastasin complexes, respectively. Also in the m-plasmin complex, only bdellastasin binding loop Asp30(U) to Glu38(U) is involved in direct proteinase contacts and forms the same hydrogen-bond pattern, as found in the bdellastasin-trypsin complexes (Figure 3). The interacting residues are sum-

marised in Table 1. As in the trypsin-bdellastasin X-ray structure, the side-chain of the P1 residue Lys34(U) adopts an extended conformation in the modelled m-plasmin complex and forms a watermediated salt bridge to Asp189(P) at the bottom of the S1 speci®city pocket. The preference for lysine over arginine as the P1 residue, probably due to the hydrogen bond formation between Lys34(U) Nz and Ser190(P) Og, is also re¯ected in the tenfold stronger inhibition of bdellastasin for human plasmin compared with hirustasin possessing a P1-Arg residue (Ki values of 12 nM and 138 nM, respectively) (Moser et al., 1998). The P2 residue Cys33(U) nestles into the open S2 depression of m-plasmin, and the side-chain of Leu31(U) (P4) extends into the open S3/S4 subsite, which is lined by the sidechains of Leu172(P), Arg175(P), Trp215(P) and Leu217(P). The P1H -Val35(U) side-chain partially ®lls the open S1H subsite delimited by His57(P) and

the Cys42(P)-Cys58(P) disulphide bridge, while the P3H -Cys37(U) side-chain is in weak contact to the 37-loop of m-plasmin. m-Plasmin appears to be able to form three more salt bridges with bdellastasin compared with trypsin. In the modelled m-plasmin-complex, the P2H Lys36(U) side-chain binds with an extended conformation into the partially open S2H pocket, formÊ ing a salt bridge with Glu143(P) Oe1 (3.0 A). This contrasts with the mostly hydrophobic P2H -S2H interactions, observed in the (modelled) trypsinbdellastasin complex, creating a weak electrostatic interaction between Lys36(U) Nx and the Tyr151(D) hydroxy-phenyl group. The remaining two salt bridges seem to be formed between P4H Glu38(U) and Lys60A(P), due to the elongated 60loop of plasmin, and between Asp30(U) and Arg221A(P) of bdellastasin and m-plasmin, respectively. The additional formation of a Lys224(D)Asp30U salt bridge in the bovine trypsin-bdellastasin complex upon MULTIDOCK-treatment (Jackson et al., 1998) shows, however, that the Arg221A(P)-Asp30(U) salt bridge of the modelled m-plasmin-bdellastasin complex might be an artefact resulting from this procedure. Thus, all quantitative data and electrostatic constants must be regarded with caution. The MULTIDOCK-treated m-plasmin and trypsin structures in complex with bdellastasin show r.m.s. Ê Ê differences of 0.664 A and 0.011 A for all 384 and 212 backbone atoms, respectively, compared with the initial structures. Furthermore, the contact surface between m-plasmin and bdellastasin amounts Ê to 750 A2, i.e. is slightly larger than the correÊ sponding surface of 690 A2 in the (modelled) trypsin-bdellastasin complex. This mainly results from the comparably wide open active-site cleft and the longer distance of trypsins surface loops to the inhibitor.

Antistasin-type inhibitors and their specificity towards trypsin, plasmin and factor Xa Bdellastasin (U) and hirustasin (H) are potent trypsin (E) and plasmin (P) inhibitors (Moser et al., 1998). Recently, the crystal structures of tissue-kallikrein-bound (Mittl et al., 1997) and free hirustasin Â (Uson et al., 1999) have been solved. By comparison of these two hirustasin structures, a rotation of 180  of the side-chains of segment Glu26 to His28 has been observed upon binding to kallikrein, accompanied by a reorientation of residues 46-48 Â (``binding switch'') (Uson et al., 1999). It has therefore been concluded for hirustasin that this segment might be ¯exible in solution and that the target proteinase enforces the elongated bound conformation. Due to the high degree of sequence homology and structural similarity with hirustasin, bdellastasin could likewise perform such a binding switch to adopt an ``elongated'' conformation in the active-site clefts of trypsin and plasmin. The identi®cation of this structural switch is thus an important clari®cation of the role of the P3-residue (His32(U) or His29(H)) or Arg32(Y)) for determining inhibitor speci®city. It appears unlikely, however, that the major differences in speci®city are caused by these minor differences in the sequence of the reactive site loop residues of bdellastasin, hirustasin and antistasin (P5-P3H ) (Figure 4). The shape of the primary binding loop of free hirustasin is similar to that of free antistasin (Y). In the crystal structure of free antistasin (Lapatto et al., 1997), residues 28-33 are not involved in crystal contacts. It has therefore been proposed that this conformation is also present in solution. The proposed model of the antistasin-factor Xa complex (Lapatto et al., 1997) as well as the rTAP-bovine factor Xa

X-ray structure (Wei et al., 1998) suggest two particularly important interactions between the inhibitor and factor Xa, responsible for speci®c mutual recognition. The ®rst one between the P3-Arg sidechain and the S3/S4 cleft, which in its central part (shaped by Tyr99(X), Phe174(X) and Trp215(X)), is well suited to accommodate the aliphatic part of the Arg side-chain. Its ``upper'' tip contains the cation hole of factor Xa (formed by the carbonyl groups of Glu97(X), Thr98(X), Ile175(X), and Thr176(X), together with the Glu97(X) side-chain) to make favourable electrostatic interactions with the distant guanidyl group of P3-Arg (Brandstetter et al., 1996). A shorter P3-His residue, as found in the bdellastasin and hirustasin complexes, is much smaller than an P3-Arg and would not reach into the cation hole, thus impairing interaction with factor Xa. Furthermore, both His residues exist in the complexes in their ``elongated'' bound conformation and would thus not be able to make favourable hydrophobic contacts with S3/S4 of factor Xa. The N-terminal domain of antistasin, in contrast, cannot undergo the binding switch due to the fact that its P3-Arg would collide with its own Phe41 and destabilise the hydrophobic core of the inhibitor. Consequently, its P3-Arg side-chain is kept in an ideal conformation to interact with factor Xa's S3/S4 cleft. However, when bound to plasmin, the P3-Arg of antistasin would clash with the positively charged Arg175(P). This mismatch would contribute to the resistance of antistasin to inhibit plasmin. The second speci®c antistasin-factor Xa interaction postulates that Glu15 of the Nn-domain of antistasin interacts with a positively charged surface site of factor Xa made by the clustered

102 residues Arg222(X), Lys223(X) and Lys224(X). The equivalent residues in hirustasin and bdellastasin are Ala and Gly, respectively, precluding such favourable electrostatic interactions. Moreover, the interfaces between both subdomains of hirustasin and bdellastasin are stabilised by hydrophobic interactions and extended hydrogen-bond networks, which favour a stretched conformation, while the N-terminal subdomains of antistasin are forced to rotate against one another, due to the repulsion of Glu15(Y) with Phe50(Y) and Tyr46(Y), and of Glu69(Y) with Tyr105(Y) and Leu101(Y). This ``swinging out'' of the N-terminal subdomains places them in a suitable position with respect to the proteinase. The necessity for a secondary binding interaction has been discussed for the rTAP-factor Xa complex. This is supported by mutagenesis and biochemical studies, demonstrating a two-step kinetic mechanism (Jordan et al., 1992) for the inhibition of factor Xa by rTAP. It is possible that formation of the secondary binding interaction between factor Xa and antistasin occurs ®rst, before the active site residues of antistasin dock to the active site of factor Xa. The lack of such favourable secondary binding interactions prevent bdellastasin from being a good factor Xa inhibitor, in spite of the theoretically possible adaptations of its reactive-site loop to the factor Xa active site.

Bdellastasin-Trypsin Complex Structures to 10 mg protein/ml by use of MicrosepTM 3 K tubes (Filtron) and dialysed against 150 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM Mes (pH 6.5). The bdellastasin-trypsin complexes were crystallised by vapour diffusion using the ``sitting drop'' method (McPherson, 1989). Two different crystals of bdellastasin in complex with bovine and porcine b-trypsin were obtained. Crystals of the bovine trypsin-bdellastasin complex (BTB) grew within ®ve months in droplets containing 4 ml of protein solution and 2 ml of reservoir solution (2.2 M ammonium sulphate, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 50 mM Mes (pH 5.6)) equilibrated at 21  C against 5 ml of reservoir solution in the well. These BTB crystals were rod-shaped and had maximal dimensions of 0.65 mm Â 0.035 mm Â 0.030 mm. Crystals of porcine trypsin complexed with bdellastasin (PTB) were cobblestone shaped and grew to maximal dimensions of 0.40 mm Â 0.30 Â mm 0.25 mm within 18 months at 21  C in droplets mixed from 3 ml of protein solution and 1 ml of reservoir solution (10 % (v/v) 2-propanol, 20 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mM hydroxyethylpiperazin-sulfonic-acid, pH 7.5) equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution. Data collection Diffraction data were recorded at 4  C from two isomorphous crystals of the bovine trypsin-bdellastasin complex and from one crystal of the porcine trypsinbdellastasin complex with a 3cm MAR Research imaging plate detector system mounted on a RU 200 Rigaku rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 5.4 kW (graphite-monochromatised CuKa radiation, Ê l  1.54 A). Images were processed using the MOSFLM package (Leslie, 1994), and data were scaled and merged with routines implemented in the CCP4 Suite (CCP4, 1994). The data processing statistics are summarised in Table 2. Molecular replacement The structures of the bovine and the porcine b-trypsin-bdellastasin complex were solved by Patterson search techniques.

Bdellastasin-Trypsin Complex Structures orientation and position of the trypsin molecules in the monoclinic crystals was performed with the program Ê AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using data up to 4.0 A and the structure of bovine b-trypsin (PDB accession code 1TPO) (Marquart et al., 1983). The rotational search showed four solutions with correlation values of 0.186, 0.176, 0.170 and 0.157 against 0.139 for the next highest peak. Translational search and rigid body ®tting for these four solutions resulted in a correlation value of 0.434 and an R value of 44.2 %. The initial phases obtained from the trypsin molecules were good enough to trace (in addition to the four trypsin molecules) residues Val27 to Lys44 of the binding-loop of bdellastasin in the averaged density, using routines from the RAVE program package (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994). However, several re®nement cycles consisting of conventional Powell energy minimisÈ ation carried out with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992a,b) did not reduce the R value. A second Patterson search was performed using data Ê in the resolution range from 12.0 to 4.0 A and the structure of bovine b-trypsin (PDB accession code 1TLD) (Bartunik et al., 1989) together with the bdellastasin fragment 27-44. The unambiguous solution showed six highest peaks in the rotation function with correlation values of 0.216, 0.209, 0.208, 0.207, 0.174 and 0.156 against 0.151 for next highest peak. Translational search and rigid body ®tting for these six solutions resulted in a correlation value of 0.623 and an R value of 36.8 %. Examination of the packing within the crystallographic unit cell indicated reasonable contacts between trypsin-bdellastasin complexes and no overlap of symmetry-related molecules. A distinct property of this crystal form is the presence of seven non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axes, as revealed by the self-rotation analysis of the diffraction data performed with GLRF (Tong & Rossmann, 1990). The highest peak at f  48  , É  90  and k  180  in the spherical polar coordinate system corresponds to three parallel NCS-axes perpendicular to the crystallographic 2-fold screw-axis. These three symmetry axes can be assigned to pairs A-D, B-C and E-F. The next highest peaks at f  87  , É  129  and k  180 and f  87  , É  51  and k  180 are generated by pairs B-F and A-E, respectively, while D-F and C-E give rise to peaks at f  9  , É  129  and k  180 and f  9  , É  51  and k  180. The orientation and position of the porcine trypsinbdellastasin complex in the tetragonal crystal was determined using the structure of porcine pancreatic trypsin (PDB accession code 1LDT) (Stubbs et al., 1997) together with the docked bdellastasin fragment 28-57. The Ê rotational search using data up to 3.5 A gave a single solution with a correlation value of 0.271 over 0.121 for the next highest peak. After applying the indicated rotation of a  60.05  , b  79.06  and g  1.34  , translation functions were calculated for the two enantiomorphic space groups P41212 and P43212. In P41212, the highest peak was 1.02 times higher then the next one (correlation coef®cient 0.352; R value 48.3 %), while in P43212 the translational search showed one solution with a correlation value of 0.650 over 0.359 for the next highest peak (R value 36.5 %), identifying the latter space group as the correct one. After applying the suggested translation of Áx  0.1168, Áy  0.7502, Áz  0.4318, rigid body ®tting with AMoRe brought the R value down to 31.8 %, while the correlation coef®cient increased to 0.753. Model building and refinement

The structure of the bovine trypsin-bdellastasin complex was re®ned with X-PLOR using the parameters by Engh & Huber (1991). The coordinates of the six correctly orientated and positioned complexes, termed A to F for the bovine b-trypsin molecules and R to W for the bdellastasin molecules, were re®ned against data Ê between 8.0 and 3.3 A. An initial envelope was de®ned using the trypsin-BPTI complex (PDB accession code 2PTC) (Marquart et al., 1983), and the 2Fo À Fc electron Ê density computed at 3.3 A was averaged six-fold with the program MAIN (Turk, 1992). This envelope was continuously adjusted to the elaborated bdellastasin model. Several cycles of alternating model building and crystallographic re®nement including conjugate gradient minimisation and simulated annealing allowed placement of residues 6-59 of the bdellastasin molecules R and U. In later stages, a restrained individual atomic temperature factor re®nement was carried out, and about 25 water molecules per trypsin, known to be conserved in serine proteinases (Sreenivasan & Axelsen, 1992), were added to the model. During re®nement procedure, NCS restraints have been applied on the six bovine trypsin and the six bdellastasin molecules. The overall statistics for the re®nement is given in Table 3. A geometry check revealed that 80.3 % and 18.6 % of all non-glycine residues lie within the most favoured and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. In all complexes, trypsin residue Asn115 lies in the generously allowed region and bdellastasin residue Ala24 in the disallowed region, with most of these residues being well de®ned in the ®nal 2Fo À Fc electron-density map in most of the independent copies. Starting with the properly rotated and translated model of porcine trypsin in complex with bdellastasin fragment 28-57, the porcine trypsin-bdellastasin complex structure was re®ned using conventional Powell energy minimisation, molecular dynamics and individual B-factor re®nement against data between 8.0 and Ê 2.8 A. In later stages of re®nement, the maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in the program CNS È Development Version 0.3 (Brunger et al., 1998) was used, and the trypsin residue Asn115 was re®ned as an b-isomerised L-aspartic acid. Therefore, a new CNS dictionary (``IAS'') for L-isoaspartic acid was created. Successive rounds of model building using the program O (Jones et al., 1991) and CNS re®nement allowed the positioning of all 223 trypsin residues, of 31 out of the 59 bdellastasin residues, of 135 water molecules and one calcium ion. Apart from a few surface-located side-chains, the trypsin moiety is almost completely de®ned by electron density, while the ¯exible loop segment Asp44-Gly47 and the N-terminal subdomain of the inhibitor lack any electron density, implying that the N terminus is disordered in the porcine trypsin-bdellastasin complex. Modelling of the m -plasmin-bdellastasin complex The docking of bdellastasin, as derived from its complex with bovine b-trypsin, to m-plasmin was guided by the superposition of the two proteinases. As a starting point, the coordinates of the m-plasmin ``enzyme'' were chosen from the published crystal structure of the ternary microplasmin-staphylokinasemicroplasmin complex (PDB entry: 1BUI) (Parry et al., 1998). Subsequently, the interface of the initially docked complex was re®ned with the program

MULTIDOCK V1.0 (Jackson et al., 1998). During the ``re®nement'', m-plasmin and bdellastasin were de®ned as receptor and ligand, respectively, in combination Ê with a 10 A distance cut-off for the intermolecular interface, including a multiple copy side-chain rotamer representation and non-bonded residue-residue interactions. An effective dielectric constant e of 4 and a maximum van der Waals atom-atom interaction energy of 2.5 kcal/mol were applied for the nonbonded interactions throughout mean ®eld optimisation and energy minimisation steps. The geometry optimisation started with the side-chain mean ®eld optimisation, until the energy from the previous step was below 0.5 kcal/mol, followed by a rigid body steepest descent minimisation of the resultant coordinates. The maximum rotational and translational step Ê sizes were 1  and 0.3 A, respectively. Minimisation continued until the energy of the system decreased by less than 10À6 kcal/mol for any given step. The coordinates were updated according to the resultant translational/rotational vectors, and further cycles of optimisation were performed until convergence of the interaction energy between the two proteins. All calculations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics O2 R10000 workstation. The energy-minimised m-plasminbdellastasin complex structure was used for further analyses. Figures were drawn with the programs ALSCRIPT (Barton, 1993), MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997), Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994), GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1993) and WebLab1ViewerProTM (Molecular Simulations Inc., 1999).
