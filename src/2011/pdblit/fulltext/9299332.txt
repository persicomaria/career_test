Crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of Mbp1, a transcription factor important in cell-cycle control of DNA synthesis
Rui-Ming Xu1, Christian Koch2, Yu Liu1, John R Horton1, Dunja Knapp2, Kim Nasmyth2 and Xiaodong Cheng1*
Background: During the cell cycle, cells progress through four distinct phases, G1, S, G2 and M; transcriptional controls play an important role at the transition between these phases. MCB-binding factor (MBF), a transcription factor from budding yeast, binds to the so-called MCB (MluI cell-cycle box) elements found in the promoters of many DNA synthesis genes, and activates the transcription of those at the G1S phase transition. MBF is comprised of two proteins, Mbp1 and Swi6. Results: The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of Mbp1 has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction from crystals of the selenomethionyl variant of the protein. The structure is composed of a six-stranded sheet interspersed with two pairs of helices. The most conserved core region among Mbp1-related transcription factors folds into a central helix-turn-helix motif with a short N-terminal strand and a C-terminal hairpin. Conclusions: Despite little sequence similarity, the structure within the core region of the Mbp1 N-terminal domain exhibits a similar fold to that of the DNAbinding domains of other proteins, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 and histone H5 from eukaryotes, and the prokaryotic catabolite gene activator. However, the structure outside the core region defines Mbp1 as a larger entity with substructures that stabilize and display the helix-turn-helix motif.

Introduction
Prior to cell division, during interphase, a cell produces copies of each chromosome during the DNA synthesis or S phase of cell division. The part of interphase immediately before S phase is termed the G1 phase. The G1 to S phase transition of the eukaryotic cell cycle is a critical point for the coordination of cell-cycle progression with cellular growth. It is now clear that transcriptional controls play an important role at this stage of the cell cycle. In budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expression of G1 cyclins and a large number of DNA synthesis genes is coordinately activated when the cell reaches the critical cell size for S phase entry. This late G1-specific transcriptional program is mediated by a pair of related heterodimeric transcription factors, called SCB-binding factor (SBF) and MCB-binding factor (MBF) (Fig. 1a; reviewed in [1]). SBF is composed of the Swi4 and Swi6 proteins and binds to the so-called Swi4­Swi6 cell-cycle box (SCB) elements (CACGAAA) found in the promoters of G1 cyclins CLN1, CLN2, PCL1, PCL2 and in the promoter of the HO endonuclease gene [2­6]. MBF contains the Mbp1 and Swi6 proteins and binds to MluI

cell-cycle box (MCB) elements (ACGCGTNA) found in the promoters of S phase cyclin genes, CLB5 and CLB6, and in many DNA synthesis genes including TMP1, POL1 and CDC9 [7­11]. Activation of SBF- and MBFmediated transcription in late G1 requires growth to a critical cell size and the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 associated with the G1 cyclin Cln3 [12­14]. It is not known whether this transcriptional activation involves a direct phosphorylation of SBF and/or MBF by the Cdc28 kinase. Sequence-specific DNA binding of SBF and MBF is mediated by the Swi4 and Mbp1 subunits, respectively. Swi6 does not bind DNA directly and is thought to have regulatory functions. The sequence of Mbp1, an 833 amino acid protein, is related to Swi4 with 30% identity at the amino acid level [10]. Most of this conservation occurs in three distinct regions (Fig. 1b): an N-terminal DNA-recognition domain with 50% identity between the two proteins [15]; the central ankyrin repeats implicated in protein­protein interactions; and a C-terminal domain which mediates the interaction with Swi6.

Regions of similarity are shaded: (I) DNA-binding domain of Mbp1, Swi4, Res1 and Res2; (II) central region encompassing copies of the ankyrin repeats among Mbp1, Swi4, Res1, Res2, Swi6 and Cdc10; and (III) C-terminal similarity of Mbp1 and Swi4. (c) Sequence alignment of the DNA-binding domains of S. cerevisiae Mbp1, Kluyveromyces lactis Mbp1, S. cerevisiae Swi4 and S. pombe Res1 and Res2. Numbering and secondary structure elements are shown for S. cerevisiae Mbp1. Invariant amino acid residues among the five proteins are highlighted (white against black). The amino acid sequences of Cdc10 and the developmental regulators Phd1, Sok2 and StuA are also shown. Highlighted residues are those shared with the invariant amino acids of the Mbp1/Swi4/Res DNA-binding domain, most of them are thought to be important in overall folding of the domain. The position of the Res1 mutation (GluLys) is indicated with an asterisk [19].

A transcription factor similar to MBF has been described in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This transcription factor binds to MCB elements within the promoter of the cdc22 ribonucleotide reductase gene and contains the Cdc10 protein which is homologous to Swi6 [16,2,8]. Like Swi6, Cdc10 has two different binding partners, called Res1 and Res2, which are homologous to Mbp1 [17­21] (Fig. 1a). (Res1 and Res2 are also known as Sct1 and Pct1, respectively [17,18,21].) Therefore, activation of an MBF-like transcription factor in late G1 appears to be a conserved feature of S phase control in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. In animal cells, the E2F class of transcription factors, though not conserved in primary structure with MBF and SBF, may perform analogous functions [22]. The primary structures of the DNA-binding domains of Mbp1, Swi4, Res1 and Res2 are highly conserved (Fig. 1c). The sequences of these DNA-binding domains show no apparent similarity to other DNA-binding motifs of proteins with known structures. However, similar sequences are found in the developmental regulators StuA [23], Phd1 [24] and Sok2 [25] from fungi. We have overexpressed, purified and crystallized the N-terminal 124 amino acid DNA-binding domain of Mbp1, termed Mbp1124. This N-terminal fragment forms protein­DNA complexes with the TMP1 promoter in gel-retardation assays in vitro [10]. Here we report the crystal structure of Mbp1124 and present a model for the interaction of Mbp1 with DNA.

Results and discussion
Structure determination

Diffraction data (Table 1) were collected at several wavelengths on the selenomethionyl form of Mbp1124 in order to employ multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing to solve the structure [26]. Following the suggestion of Ramakrishnan [27,28], multiwavelength data were treated as if they were from a conventional multiple isomorphous replacement experiment with the inclusion of anomalous scattering (MIRAS). In our case, data from only two wavelengths were sufficient for phase determination: one from a conventional rotating-anode generator and one from the synchrotron source at the absorption K-edge of selenium, determined by the measurement of X-ray fluorescence from a selenomethionyl Mbp1124 crystal (see Materials and methods).
Overall structure and conserved sequences

Amino acid residues 1­124 of Mbp1 were expressed in Escherichia coli as a peptide fused to a polyhistidine tag (a 15-residue peptide including six histidine residues; see Materials and methods). The whole polypeptide chain was 139 residues long (labeled as ­15 to 124). Residues 4­102 were built into the electron density. This 99-residue structure contains the conserved core of the DNA-binding domain; the sequence after amino acid 80 diverges significantly from other Mbp1-like proteins (Fig. 1c). The structure consists of a twisted six-stranded antiparallel sheet

( 1­ 6) and two pairs of helices ( A­ B and C­ D) located on one side of the sheet (Fig. 2). Loops or turns are designated by their flanking secondary structures (e.g. loop 5­6 is between strands 5 and 6). At the level of primary sequence, the first four strands ( 1­ 4) are contiguous and form one plane, followed by helices A and B, a hairpin ( 5­ 6), and helices C and D at the C terminus (Fig. 1c). The plane formed by the first four strands is almost perpendicular to the hairpin 5­ 6. Strand 4 is a short three-residue stretch comprising residues 33­35. The mainchain NH and C=O groups of this short strand make two hydrogen bonds with each of the neighboring strands, 3 and 6. Helices A and B form a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif with a turn of four amino acids in length, while helices C and D are in an antiparallel arrangement with a proline-induced bend at position 98 of helix D. Helix C is packed with A and B, while helix D is packed with strands 2 and 3.

The structure clearly demonstrates the importance of the highly conserved amino acids within the Mbp1/Swi4/Res family. The conserved nonpolar amino acids, particularly those with aromatic sidechains, form the hydrophobic core of the molecule. Tyr10 in 1, Val15 in 2, Tyr73 in loop 5­6 (phenylalanine in Swi4) and Trp77 in 6 surround the sidechain of Met26 (in 3) in the middle of the sheet (Fig. 3). This methionine residue was replaced by selenomethionine whose selenium position was used in the structural determination. Trp33 (in 4) stacks with the proline ring at position 79, which is involved in making a sharp bend in going from the end of the hairpin into helix C. Hydrophobic amino acids from helices A, B and C (including Leu55 and Leu86) are packed together. Ion pairings (Asp31­Arg28­Glu64), sidechain interactions (Glu17­ Tyr10­Lys72), and sidechain­backbone interactions (Ser11­ Gly69 and Asn35­Gly75) anchor the hairpin to the first four strands and confer additional stability to the sheet.

One difference between the S. pombe Cdc10­Res1/2 and S. cerevisiae Swi6­Mbp1/Swi4 transcription complexes is that the N terminus of Cdc10, unlike that of Swi6, also contains considerable homology to the Mbp1/Swi4/Res DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1c; [15]). All of the conserved amino acids shared by Cdc10 are involved in the overall folding of the domain, suggesting the Cdc10 may contain a structurally similar domain. However, in vitro translated Cdc10 does not appear to have DNA-binding activity in gel-retardation assays [21], apparently due to the lack of conserved amino acids involved in DNA contacts. We think that Cdc10 and Swi6 may have a common ancestor with the other proteins listed in Figure 1c. While Swi6 has diverged extensively in its N terminus, Cdc10 has diverged to a lesser extent maintaining its original fold. In support of this idea, the six invariant amino acids amongst
Figure 4

these proteins, Arg28 ( 3), Asn35 ( 4), Leu54 ( B) and Gly75-X-Trp77-X-Pro79 ( 6), are all important for the domain structure as a whole. In addition, Arg50 of the HTH motif and Gly69 of the hairpin are also conserved among all proteins that have DNA-binding activity, including the developmental regulators Phd1, Sok2 and StuA. This is consistent with these amino acids being essential for DNA sequence specificity and binding (see section on DNA binding).
Comparison with HTH proteins

The majority of the conserved amino acids in Mbp1 are located in the region between strands 3 and 6 (residues 26­79) including the HTH and the hairpin. The topology of this region is very similar to some classical HTH proteins including the DNA-binding domains of catabolite

The surface charge distribution was computed at neutral pH and displayed at the level of the solvent-accessible surface, assuming a probe radius of 1.4 Å to represent a water molecule, and the dielectric constants of 80 and 2 for the solvent and protein, respectively. The surface is colorcoded: blue for positive (15 KBT), red for negative (­15 KBT), and white for neutral, where KB is the Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Some of the conserved charged sidechains from the HTH and the hairpin are labeled. (The figure was produced using the program GRASP [59].) An ideal 12 base pair B-DNA duplex is included in the figure to depict the relative size.

gene activator (CAP) [29], biotin repressor (BirA) [30], the globular domain of the linker histone H5 (GH5) [27], hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3 ) [31], heat shock transcription factor (HSF) [32,33] and ETS domains [34­37]. Figure 4 illustrates a topological comparison among these proteins. All these proteins have a short strand immediately N-terminal to the HTH and a hairpin C-terminal to the HTH; we refer to such a fold as the common core. The presence of the common core in evolutionarily divergent proteins suggests that this particular variant of the HTH motif has been evolutionarily successful. When the common cores among Mbp1, CAP, BirA, HNF-3 and GH5 proteins are superimposed, the HTH motifs align well (the root mean square deviation of C atoms between Mbp1 and the other four proteins is < 2 Å; Fig. 2b), whereas the strands deviate significantly due to the size difference of the two helices. Another difference within the common core lies in the turns between the helices. The turns in classical HTH proteins, such as CAP and BirA, are four residues in length with a glycine at the second position [38]. Mbp1 also has a four-residue turn but lacks the glycine, while GH5 and HNF-3 have longer turns with six and eight residues, respectively. The Mbp1 structure reveals significant differences outside of the common core from these other HTH proteins: most notably the positioning of the helix that packs with the HTH motif and the number of strands prior to the HTH. The HTH motif is not itself an independent stable domain [39], but requires other secondary elements to

form a stable globular structure. For example, in the trihelical engrailed homeodomain [40], a third helix immediately preceding the HTH motif covers the hydrophobic face of the HTH motif. In the tetrahelical DNA-binding domains (examples include and 434 repressors [41,42], 434 Cro [43] and the POU-specific domain [44]) two helices (the first and fourth) immediately preceding and following the HTH motifs, respectively serve the same purpose. The helix (or helices) can also be separated from the HTH motif by one or more strands. This HTH family of proteins can be further subgrouped into four types (1­4) depending on the relative primary sequence position of the third helix and the number of strands between the third helix and the HTH motif (Fig. 4). Among type 3 (HNF-3 , GH5 and BirA) and type 4 (CAP, HSF and ETS) proteins, the third helix, which is packed against the HTH, is located upstream of the common core. Mbp1 (type 1) does not have the upstream helix, instead it has a pair of helices C-terminal to the common core. Based on the superimposition of HTH proteins, one of the C-terminal helices ( C) in Mbp1 appears to be analogous, but oppositely oriented, to the upstream helix in type 3 and type 4 proteins. The topology of Mu transposase (MuA; type 2) is similar to that of Mbp1 with the third helix located C-terminal to the common core [45]. The HNF-3 -like structures have been termed the `winged-helix' DNA-binding motif [46,47], because the HNF-3 structure contains two wings (or loops) that interact with DNA. One loop (W1) of the hairpin in HNF-3 (the analogue of loop 5­6 in Mbp1) interacts with the

354

Structure 1997, Vol 5 No 3

phosphate backbone of a neighboring DNA molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit [31]. A second 24residue long loop (W2) located C-terminal to the hairpin makes a minor groove base contact and both major and minor groove phosphate contacts. However, the region corresponding to W2 in Mbp1 (residues 79­102) adopts a two-helix conformation ( C and D) and is located far from the putative DNA-binding surface (Fig. 5) making it unlikely to contact DNA.
DNA binding

The DNA-binding activity of Mbp1 was originally discovered by UV cross-linking of MBF to DNA: Mbp1, but not Swi6, can be cross-linked to MCB elements [7]. Gelretardation analysis showed the N-terminal 124-residue fragment of Mbp1 to form two retarded protein­DNA complexes with the TMP1 promoter. These complexes probably correspond to the occupation of either one or both MCB sites located within the TMP1 promoter [10]. A sequence comparison of 32 MCB sites indicates a consensus core element of ACGCGTNA [9]. The asymmetric feature in the recognition sequence suggests that Mbp1 is probably a monomeric DNA-binding protein. The high degree of amino acid sequence similarity between the DNA-binding domains of Mbp1 and Swi4 is also reflected in their selectivity for similar DNA sequences. The consensus sequence of MCBs (ACGCGTNA) and SCBs (CACGAAAA) are similar and the elements cross-compete in gel-retardation assays [7]. In fact, direct binding of the DNA-binding domain of Swi4 to MCBs and that of Mbp1 to SCBs has been detected [10]. On the other hand, the different amino acids at certain positions, such as position 52 in helix B (arginine in Mbp1/Res and lysine in Swi4), might be responsible for the difference in the recognition sequences. The conserved charged or polar amino acid residues from the HTH and the hairpin lie on one face of the molecule and form a basic surface with a channel running across it (Fig. 5). The basic nature of this surface strongly suggests its involvement in contacting DNA. The Mbp1 `recognition helix' B, containing Arg50, Thr51, Arg52 (lysine in Swi4), Glu55 and Lys56 (arginine in Res2), could provide a complementary surface to the concave face of the major groove, while one phosphodiester backbone may run across the channel. In addition, the tip of the hairpin (Gly68-Gly69-Phe70-Gly71) appears to be flexible, as indicated by its weak electron density and the highest thermal factors of the whole structure. This flexibility may be due to the absence of the DNA in the crystal and suggests a potential conformational change upon DNA binding. Our structure has a linear distance of about 37 Å along the axis of the double helix (Fig. 5), consistent with the footprinting result that MBF protects a tennucleotide stretch spanning the distal MCB element of the TMP1 promoter [7].

Structurally, Glu55 of Mbp1 is in helix B where the sidechain could make base contacts (Fig. 5). A mutation of Res1 that changes the corresponding glutamic acid to a lysine residue was isolated as a suppressor of a temperature sensitive cdc10 mutant [19] (asterisk in Fig. 1c). The GluLys mutant of Res1 restored Cdc10-mediated DNAbinding activity in extracts from cdc10 mutants. Interestingly, this Res1 GluLys mutation also suppressed a cdc10 null mutation, suggesting the mutant Res1 may increase the binding affinity for DNA in vivo and become able to activate transcription without the need for Cdc10 [19]. It is noteworthy that the developmental regulators Phd1, Sok2 and StuA carry a basic instead of an acidic amino acid at the equivalent position as in the Mbp1/Swi4/Res family. It is not known if these developmental regulators have binding partners.

Biological implications
Eukaryotic cells replicate by means of an orderly progression of carefully controlled events, known collectively as the cell cycle. Cells progress through four distinct phases during a single cell cycle: G1, S, G2 and M. During the cycle, normal cells process biochemical signals from their environment and will either commit to the next step in the cycle or remain, or become, quiescent. Most cells commit to a new round of DNA synthesis and cell division just before the G1S transition. Transcriptional controls play an important role at the G1 to S phase transition of the eukaryotic cell cycle. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expression of G1 cyclins and many DNA synthesis genes is coordinately activated when cells enter S phase. This transcriptional program is mediated by two related transcription factor complexes: SCB-binding factor (SBF) and MCBbinding factor (MBF). Both are heterodimeric complexes containing a common subunit. SBF is a complex composed of Swi4 and Swi6 proteins, whereas MBF contains the proteins Mbp1 and Swi6. Sequence-specific DNA binding is mediated by the Swi4 and Mbp1 subunits, which carry a conserved DNA-binding domain at their N termini with no apparent similarity to motifs of known structure. Swi6 does not bind DNA directly and is thought to have regulatory functions. This class of transcription factors is also found in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe where the related transcription factors Cdc10 (similar to Swi6), and Res1 and Res2 (similar to Mbp1) activate gene expression upon entry into the cell cycle. We describe here the structure of the DNA-binding domain of Mbp1. The structure, which consists of a sixstranded sheet with two pairs of helices, appears to be another variant of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure. Despite little sequence similarity, the structure shows a similar fold within its core region to the DNA-binding

domains of other proteins, such as those of the wingedhelix family including catabolite gene activator protein (CAP), the globular domain of the linker histone H5 (GH5), hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3 ) and ETS domains. However, the structure outside the core defines Mbp1 as a larger entity containing structures that stabilize and display HTH-type motifs. The structure provides a rational framework for future functional studies of this transcription factor, including those regions not involved in DNA binding. Interestingly, the N terminus of Cdc10 contains the conserved residues that underpin our structure, suggesting that Cdc10, which is not known to bind DNA itself, may exhibit a common structural motif.

Crystallization of polyhistidine-tagged Mbp1124
Single, well formed crystals were grown at 16°C in a 6 l hanging drop containing equal volumes of protein solution (10 mg ml­1 or higher in 300 mM NaCl and 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) and mother liquor (70% of saturated sodium citrate and 100 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). After the protein and precipitant were mixed, oil-like droplets first formed and then gradually disappeared with the appearance of crystals. Eventually, the crystals reached their maximum size of approximately 0.5 × 0.25 × 0.25 mm after several weeks. Individual crystals were harvested into the buffer containing 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1450 and 100 mM Hepes at pH 8.0. Crystals were stable when stored under these conditions at 16°C. Crystals were of the tetragonal space group P41212 (or its enantiomorph P43212) with unit cell dimensions of 43.35 Å × 43.35 Å × 124.22 Å, determined with the program DENZO [50]. The space group was determined based on the systematic absences of reflections along the a* and c* axes. From the calculated molecular mass (16 175 Da) of polyhistidine-tagged Mbp1124 and unit cell parameters, we calculated the packing density (1.85 Å3 Da­1) and the solvent content (34%), using the Matthews' method [51]. There was one molecule per asymmetric unit.

Materials and methods

Overexpression and purification of Mbp1124
The first 124 amino acids of Mbp1 were fused to an N-terminal 16residue peptide (MARRASVGTDHHHHHH) the initiating formyl-methionine of the polyhistidine tag was cleaved during expression as confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing. This construct was cloned into the T7 expression vector pET-11d [48] to create the plasmid pET43 (C2681). It was then transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells [48] containing T7 RNA polymerase to create the strains used for overproduction. BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET43 cells were grown at 37°C in LB or M9ZB medium containing ampicillin (100 g ml­1) and chloramphenicol (25 g ml­1). At an OD600 of 0.8, isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. After 3 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended twice in STE buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA), and frozen as a paste at ­70°C. The recombinant polyhistidine-tagged Mbp1124 product accounts for about 10% of the total protein in the cell. The polyhistidine-tagged Mbp1124 was purified on immobilized nickel columns via the six histidine residues [49]. Frozen cells were thawed, resuspended, ruptured by sonication and centrifuged to yield a cleared supernatant. Nucleic acids were precipitated from the crude extract by the slow addition of one-half volume of a 10 mg ml­1 stock solution of protamine sulfate and removed by centrifugation. The cleared supernatant was dialyzed overnight and loaded onto a 20 ml Ni2+-nitrolotriacetate-agarose column. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing imidazole. Most of the remaining contaminants were removed by a Pharmacia Mono-S (10/10) FPLC column. Typically, 2 L of culture yielded about 14­20 mg of > 95% pure protein, as judged from a coomassie stained 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Selenium-containing proteins and crystals
We chose to incorporate Se atoms as the anomalous scatterer. As the polyhistidine-tagged Mbp1124 contains 2 methionines at positions 1 and 26, we replaced the methionines in the protein with selenomethionine (SeMet) by overexpressing the protein in the methionine-requiring auxotroph DL41(DE3) in a defined medium that supplies SeMet [52]. DL41(DE3) was manufactured from DL41 in the Hendrickson laboratory (Columbia University) in the same manner that BL21(DE3) was made from BL21 [48] and was a gift to us. DL41(DE3) cells were transformed with pET43 and the resultant cells were grown in a similar manner to BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET43 except for the change of medium. Purification and crystallization procedures were the same as those used for the native protein. Though the SeMet crystals took about three times longer to grow, they diffracted to a higher resolution (1.71 Å) than the native crystals (2.0 Å). Only the Se position of SeMet26 was determined and used in the phase calculation. The Se position of amino acid residue 1 was not determined primarily due to the flexibility in this region. However, the presence of Met1 was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing.

X-ray diffraction data (Table 1) from three Se-containing crystals were collected at 16°C or room temperature on two instruments, and processed using the HKL software package [50]. Crystal number 1 was used for data collection using our in-house R-AXIS IIC image-plate

MAD phasing
One Se position of SeMet (corresponding to amino acid 26) was determined from both the anomalous and the isomorphous difference Patterson maps between data sets collected at wavelengths 1, 2 and 3, respectively. This Se position (fractional coordinates x = 0.219, y = 0.334, z = 0.111) was used for phasing using the program PHASES [53] by treating the data from each wavelength as a native ( 0 or 3) and derivative isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering ( 1 and 2) (Table 2). With these data we can combine up to as many as five different sources of phase information (MIRAS): two isomorphous sets and two derivative anomalous scattering sets from 1 and 2, and one native anomalous scattering set from 3, or as little as two sources of phase information, single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS): one isomorphous set and one derivative anomalous scattering set from either 1 or 2. By systematically trying various combinations we found that, at least in our case, the SIRAS phases with 0 as the native gave the same quality of maps as the MIRAS phases (Fig. 3).

Model building and refinement
Phase refinement using PHASES was followed by 16 cycles (4, 4, 8) of solvent flattening using 30% solvent content. The graphics program O [54] was used to examine the electron-density maps calculated from both the solvent-flattened phases and initial MAD-SIRAS phases at 3.0Å resolution. Both electron-density maps were of excellent quality, and allowed the placing of amino acids 4­102 of Mbp1124 into the density. The resultant model was initially refined against the 4 data in the resolution range of 8.0­2.5 Å by simulated annealing and least-square minimizations using the X-PLOR program suite [55]. Seven rounds of refinement and model rebuilding brought the crystallographic R factor to 0.265. The model was further refined against higher resolution data in the resolution range of 5.0­1.71 Å. An additional 15 rounds of refinement, refitting, and placing ordered water molecules brought the R factor to 0.197 (Tables 3,4). The 15-residue polyhistidine-tag followed by three amino acid residues in the N terminus and 22 amino acids in the C-terminal end were not modeled because of poor electron density, presumably due to their increased flexibility. The stereochemical quality of the structure was checked by PROCHECK [56] and CCP4 [57].

*Rvalue =  | Fo­Fc | /  | Fo |, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively. The Rvalue and Rfree were computed for about 90% and 10% of the data, respectively. B is the thermal factor of individual atoms, which is related to the mean square amplitude (r2) of vibration by B = 8 2r2. detector mounted onto an Elliott GX-21 rotating-anode X-ray generator producing monochromatic CuK radiation ( 0 = 1.54 Å, 108° rotation, 1.5° increment and 30 min exposure at 45 KV, 95 mA and 4.3 Kw). Crystal number 2 was used for data collection using a MarResearch imaging-plate detector on beamline X12-C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were collected at three distinct wavelengths, at ~16°C with the c axis of the crystal aligned with the rotational axis (51° rotations, 1.5° increment, and 15­20 s exposure at 2.5 GeV, ~180­150 mA ring current) to capture the Bijvoet pairs on a single image frame. These three wavelengths correspond to the peak (maximum f, 1 = 0.9789 Å), the inflection point (minimum f, 2 = 0.9792 Å) of the Se-containing crystal absorption spectrum, and a third wavelength at an energy of 250 eV above the peak position ( 3 = 0.96 Å). A higher resolution data set (up to 1.71 Å) was collected from crystal number 3 Table 4 Refinement statistics.
