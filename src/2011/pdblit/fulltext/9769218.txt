Large aggregates of purple membrane have been produced by solubilization of purple membrane in Triton X100, followed by removal of the detergent by dialysis a,gainst 0.9 M or I.0 M-phosphate (pH 5.0). Although the crystals are not yet large enough for X-ray analysis, they appear microscopically crystalline in three dimensions, with space group P321 or P312. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy and diffraction analysis show that oath membrane forming the aggregate has the normal P3 packing (a = 63 A). Membranes are arranged in pairs, with their extracellular surfaces in close cont,act, and these pairs then stack up to form large aggregates. The large aggregates appear to be perfect three-dimensional crystals only over small regions, up to 12 membranes thick. There arc occasional inclusions of solvent between membrane pairs, and "coincidence lattice" defects occur.

1. Introduction
No large three-dimensional crystals of an integral tram-membrane protein have yet been obtained. Small three-dimensional crystals of about 1 pm diameter have been obtained from a cytochrome oxidase preparation (Vanderkooi et al., 1972). Twodimensional crystals (which have true three-dimensional order but with a periodicity in only two directions) have been observed with a variety of membrane proteins (Seki et al., 1970; Vanderkooi et al., 1972; Ross et al., 1977; Fuller et al., 1979; Michel et al., 1980; Wingfield et al., 1979), and three-dimensional crystals of hydrophilic fragments of integral membrane proteins have also been grown (Wiley & Skehel, 1977). Clearly, for high resolution structure determination of intact membrane proteins true three-dimensional crystals of the entire molecule are essential. We present here some promising results indicating the sort of procedure which may be ultimately successful.

3. Results and Discussion
Birefringent particles were first seen at low magnification in a polarizing microscope.

These had the appearance of very thin plates, up to 5 pm thick, with birefringence observed most strongly when the plates were viewed edge-on. Viewing at higher magnification under phase contrast (Fig. 1) shows that the aggregates are less regular The characteristic purple colour of this superpositions of sheet-like structures. material means that it must be several hundred membranes thick (an optical density of 0.5 at 560 nm requires 600 membranes superimposed), giving an overall thickness of several pm in agreement with the dimensions seen in edge views. X-ray diffraction where a large volume of specimen is irradiated gives a pattern indistinguishable from that of native purple membrane (Fig. 2(a)). However, with a Frank's camera having a very small beam size, particularly where only a small volume of specimen at the edge of a pellet is irradiated, a pattern in which spots are present proves as part of the normal ring pattern (Fig. 2(b)) is observed. Their occurrence the existence of stacks of membrane sheets with identical lattice azimuths, since there is not enough scattering power in any single two-dimensional sheet to produce a

spot. A stack of this sort could produce such diffraction spots even with random 2, y or z translations between the membranes, but it is very much more likely that the binding forces between the membranes would favour three-dimensional crystallinity, i.e. non-random translational stacking. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy gives t,he best picture of the way these aggregates are constructed, since it distinguishes clearly between the membrane P and E faces, so revealing the orientation of each membrane. On the E faces, the individual lattice spacings of 54 A are clearly visible, but these are less obvious on the P faces because of the mosaic rearrangement of the protein molecules which occurs during fracture (Fisher & Stoeckenius, 1977). In Figure 3 a crystalline stack of membranes grown in 0.9 M-phosphate is shown fractured at a small oblique angle to the membrane plane, while Figure 4 shows a similar preparation fractured roughly perpendicularly. The perpendicular view reveals roughly parallel arrays of membrane pairs approximately 130 A thick, partially separated by solvent inclusions. The oblique view shows two types of fracture face, labelled EF and PF, which have the characteristic patterns of the extracellular and cytoplasmic fracture faces of purple membrane patches in intact Halobacterium cells (Blaurock & Stoeckenius, 1971). These fracture faces are consistently found to alternate through the specimen, grouped in pairs. Within each pair the two fracture faces appear to be almost at the same level in the structure, without a big step between them, the E face always appearing above the P face (closer to the observer). This is exactly what one would expect from a closely apposed pair of purple membranes with their extracellular surfaces in contact, since Fisher et al. (1978) have shown that in native purple membrane the fracture plane passes very close to the extracellular surface. They found that after fracture the extracellular leaflet of purple membrane has an undetectably small thickness viewed by shadowing, but still shows a hexagonal pattern; they also found that the thickness of the cytoplasmic leaflet is approximately equal to the total thickness of the uncleaved membrane. We assume this indicates that during fracture all the protein remains with the ice on the cytoplasmic side, together with half of the lipid, leaving only the extracellular half of the lipid bilayer on the extracellular side. Because of the high protein to lipid ratio in the purple membrane, this would give a mass ratio of 7 : 1 or a mean thickness of 40 A (cytoplasmic) and 5 A (extracellular) after fracture. This interpretation of our freeze-fracture patterns, as due to pairs of membranes with their extracellular faces in close cont,act, is confirmed by closer examination. In membrane stacks grown from 0.9 M-phosphate, solvent is visible (labelled S) as inclusions between adjacent membrane pairs (Figs 3 and 4). Where some of the ice adjacent to an E face has been removed by etching, a membrane step is always revealed. This step is between the E face and the etched P surface (labelled EF and PS, respectively, in Fig. 3), and corresponds to the thickness of the cytoplasmic

leaflet of the upper membrane in the pair. Since the solvent always separates cytoplasmic surfaces, the molecular interactions between the extracellular surfaces of the reconstituted purple membranes seem to be stronger than those between t)heir cytoplasmic surfaces. When membranes are reconstituted from phosphate buffer at 1.0 M, the solvent regions are smaller, and larger regions of perfect clone contact between membrane pairs are found (Fig. 5). In stacks of membranes in which t,ht: outer (cytoplasmic) surfaces of adjacent membrane pairs are in close contact,, without an intervening solvent inclusion, oblique fracture leads to a large step betweet each apposed membrane pair, where the fracture plane jumps from t,he EF of bho upp~ membrane of the lower pair to the PF of the lower membrane of the upper pair. thck height of this large step corresponding to the thickness of the two i,ouching c:ytoplasmic leaflets. The two membranes which comprise each membrane pair, wit.h their extracellular surfaces in close contact, always have the same orientation of their membrane lat,ticcs. Frequently a stack of three or four of these membrane pairs will form a small threcdimensional array with crystalline orientation preserved throughout the &ack (Fig. 3). An equally common occurrence is an abrupt change in orienhation between adjacent membrane pairs, of the sort which might suggest a random interaction (Fig. 3). However, electron diffraction of these specimens shows tha,t this is not the case. since their diffraction patterns show regular coincidences of certain diRract,ion spots in the ot,herwise non-overlapping patterns, indicating that while there are membranes in t.he stack having different orientations, these differences are not random. Thesck are examples of the commonly found coi&dence lattice defects found in many crystals (e.g. see Unwin & Taddei, 1977), where only certain lat,tice points bet.ween layers arc' coincident,. Figure 6 shows t'hree typical diffractlion patterns from different> arf'as. each a few (1 t)o 8) membranes thick. The first pattern in Figure 6 is from a stack of membranes with full (C,) coincidence. All the membrane pairs have thr same azimuthal orientation and show the normal purple membrane pattern with the additional mm symmetry expected because the membranes are alternat)ing in t,heir vertical orientation in the st,ack. The other two examples in Figure 6 are of C, and '219 coincidence which are two of the most coincident of an infinite family of Iat,ticrn. Table 1 shows some of the properties of these and a few of the other lattices which may occur. Tt shows, for example, that the Z, Jattice occurs when the (I,?) spot from one membrane pair overlaps the (2,l) spot, from an adjacent. pair. This is brought about by an azimuthal rotation of one membrane pair by 21.79" with respect to the adjacent pair. These observations show that even the rather weak int!eraction which exists under our present conditions between t,he cytoplasmic surfaces of purple membranes, are strong enough to produce some three-dimensional crvstallinity. 1n summary, the aggregates formed by removal of Triton Xl00 from solubilizod purple membrane in the presence of 0.9 or 1.0 M-sodium phosphat)e (pH 5.0) demonstrate considerable three-dimensional order, but also show numerous defects which prevent formation of large three-dimensional crystals. These defects are less at, the higher concentration of salt. Experiments with other non-ionic detergents which art' not, themselves precipitated (as is Triton X100) at salt concentrations higher t~han 1.0 M may be more SUCceSSfd. We hope that the combination of slow detergent removal to promote crystallization

t The subscript number indicates the degree of coincidence between the 2 reciprocal lattices. For C,, every lattice point is coincident; for C,, 1 in every 7 lattice points is coincident, etc. 1 Positive is anticlockwise rotation of the top membrane pair. 5 A smaller negative rotation produces the same coincidence. // These numbers refer to electron diffraction observations. In the freeze-fracture electron micrographs, the distortion of the angles caused by the foreshortening of the tilted membranes, which occurs in oblique fractures, makes such assignment difficult. within the plane of the membrane together with increased salt concentration (or change of pH, etc.) to promote specific interactions in the hydrophilic regions (by analogy with crystallization of soluble proteins) will provide a general philosophy for obtaining large three-dimensional crystals of integral membrane proteins.

We are most grateful to Dr J. Langmore for producing the X-ray picture shown in Figure 2(b). Note added in proof. Michel & Oesterhelt (unpublished data) have recently produced three-dimensional crystals of bacteriorhodopsin using the detergent octyl-glucoside at salt concentrations of 2.5 M-ammonium sulphate or 2.8 M-sodium phosphate.
