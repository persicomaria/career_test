Abstract--In this study, we have demonstrated that the critical hydrogen bonding motif of the established 3-aminopyrazinone thrombin inhibitors can be effectively mimicked by a 2-aminopyridine N-oxide. As this peptidomimetic core is more resistant toward oxidative metabolism, it also overcomes the metabolic liability associated with the pyrazinones. An optimization study of the P1 benzylamide delivered the potent thrombin inhibitor 21 (Ki = 3.2 nM, 2xaPTT = 360 nM), which exhibited good plasma levels and half-life after oral dosing in the dog (Cmax = 2.6 lM, t1/2 = 4.5 h).

Thrombosis-related disorders such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thromboembolic stroke remain a major cause of morbidity worldwide.1 The limitations associated with current therapies2 have driven the search for small-molecule direct inhibitors of specific enzymes involved in the coagulation cascade.3 In this regard, inhibitors of both thrombin and factor Xa have attracted considerable recent attention.4 In our laboratories, the search for potent and orally bioavailable direct thrombin inhibitors has led to the evaluation of pyrazinone based small molecule peptidomimetics (1, Fig. 1).5 Detailed metabolic studies indicated a significant degree of oxidative metabolism around the pyrazinone core.6 As a result, we sought to

identify alternative P2 peptidomimetic cores that would retain the classical H-bond network with glycine-216 of the enzyme (Fig. 1); one such alternative envisioned was a pyridine N-oxide scaffold.7 Preparation of pyridine N-oxide derivative 2, the direct analog of pyrazinone 1, afforded a 6 nM thrombin inhibitor and provided support for this strategy. A cyano group at the 5-position provided a further potency enhancement (Fig. 1, 3). As anticipated, the corresponding neutral pyridine derivatives are significantly less potent against thrombin than their parent compounds (pyridine of 2: Ki = 620 nM; pyridine of 3: Ki = 103 nM; structures not shown), consistent with the N-oxide oxygen serving as an H-bond acceptor. Additionally, X-ray crystallographic analysis of a related inhibitor 4 bound in the active site of thrombin (Fig. 2, PDB Code: 1Z71) clearly demonstrates the H-bond network with glycine-216. An initial study focused on incorporating the optimized P1 groups recently discovered in our laboratories into the P2 pyridine N-oxide template (Table 1).8 Compounds were evaluated for their thrombin inhibitory potency and their functional ability to double the activated partial thromboplastin time (2xaPTT) in human plasma.9 The unsubstituted P1 benzyl amide 5 (Ki = 150 nM) functions as the benchmark compound. Installation of the N-linked triazole at the ortho-position of the P1 benzyl or pyridyl group8a yields inhibitors (6­8) with both good intrinsic and functional potency. Introduction of a 2-aminomethyl substituent8b also results in a significant potency improvement, as illustrated by compounds 9 and 10. Incorporation of a meta-chloro substituent affords a significant improvement in intrinsic potency

(e.g., 12 vs 5), but, as noted in earlier studies, the concomitant increase in lipophilicity is detrimental to functional activity.10 The combination of the ortho-azole and the meta-chloro substituents affords exquisitely potent thrombin inhibitors (13­16); for example, compound 16 displays a 2 pM Ki against thrombin, with a 2xaPTT of 100 nM. Similarly, the potency-enhancing aminomethyl and chlorine substituents can be merged

in an additive fashion to yield extremely potent thrombin inhibitors (17­19). The most potent compound produced from this study is 18 (Ki = 1 pM), displaying a 2xaPTT of 70 nM. Having completed an investigation of the P1 SAR, we turned our attention to the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of members of this series (Table 2). Upon oral dosing of aminomethyl derivative 9 (0.65 mpk) to dogs, a 0.82 lM maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and a 1.5 h plasma half-life (t1/2) were achieved. The meta-chloro analog 17 similarly displayed a promising pharmacokinetic profile (Cmax = 0.70 lM, t1/2, = 1.3 h). As the tri- and tetrazole analogs (13­16) had inferior pharmacokinetic profiles, our efforts focused on the optimization of the P1 aminomethyl series. Metabolism studies involving human and dog microsomal incubations revealed that the desired objective of minimizing the extent of P2 metabolism had been achieved; however, P1 benzylic site oxidation and subsequent N-dealkylation now arose as the primary metabolic pathway. In an attempt to attenuate this metabolism, a study to substitute the benzylic sites was initiated (Table 2). Methylation of the benzylic position alpha to the P1 amide group (Table 2, Y = Me) and resolution gave access to inhibitors 20 and 21. The more active enantiomer 21 displays an 8-fold loss in binding potency (vs 9) yet maintains good anticoagulant activity (Ki = 3.2 nM, 2xaPTT = 360 nM); notably, this modification resulted in a significant improvement in the pharmacokinetic profile (21, Cmax = 2.6 lM, t1/2 = 4.5 h). Methylation at the other benzylic site was also tolerated, but did not lead to improved dog pharmacokinetics (22­23). Inspection of the X-ray crystal structure of the related inhibitor 4 bound in the active site of thrombin (Fig. 2) suggested that strategic placement of a hydrogen bonding group at the P1 benzylic position could potentially gain access to an additional interaction with residues contained within the active site (e.g., Ser-195). This analysis is supported by the 5-fold

potency increase (vs 21) attained with the hydroxymethyl analog 24. The high levels of potency demonstrated by the orthoaminomethyl and tetrazole analogs (Table 1, 15­19) offered the possibility that significant truncation of these molecules could still deliver potent thrombin inhibitors. Accordingly, complete excision of the P3 binding element afforded inhibitors in the low to mid nanomolar range (Table 3, 25­28); most notable is compound 28 with a Ki = 10 nM and a 2xaPTT = 560 nM (MW = 346). Unfortunately, removal of the P3 group afforded no significant advantage regarding pharmacokinetic profile. The synthesis of these P2 pyridine N-oxide inhibitors is outlined in Scheme 1.11 Protection of 2-amino-6-methyl-

pyridine with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, followed by regioselective chlorination affords 30. The pyridylacetate 31 is produced via benzylic metalation of 30 with LDA and subsequent quenching with diethyl carbonate. Alkylation of 31 with the P3 2,2-difluoro-2-(2-pyridyl)ethyl-trifluoromethanesulfonate 325 completes the assembly of the key P3­P2 subunit 33. Ester hydrolysis and P1 amide coupling are followed by deprotection and then pyridine oxidation12 with mCPBA to afford the final products 34. The cyano pyridines are prepared via an analogous route starting from 2-amino-5-cyano6-methylpyridine. The des-P3 analogs can be assembled in a similar manner from key intermediate 31. Base hydrolysis is followed by EDC mediated amide formation. Amine deprotection and final pyridine N-oxidation deliver the des-P3 thrombin inhibitors. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the critical hydrogen bonding motif of the established 3-aminopyrazinone thrombin inhibitors can be effectively mimicked by a 2-aminopyridine N-oxide. As this peptidomimetic core is more resistant toward oxidative metabolism, it also overcomes the metabolic liability associated with the pyrazinones. An optimization study of the P1 benzylamide delivered the potent thrombin inhibitor, 21 which exhibited good plasma levels and half-life after oral dosing in the dog. Studies to explore the generality of 2aminopyridine N-oxides as peptidomimetics are underway.
