ABSTRACT The cytosolic isoform XIII is a recently discovered member of the human carbonic anhydrase (hCA, EC 4.2.1.1) family. It is selectively expressed among other tissues in the reproductive organs, where it may control pH and ion balance regulation, ensuring thus proper fertilization conditions. The authors report here the X-ray crystallographic structure of this isozyme in the unbound state and in complex with a classical sulfonamide inhibitor, namely acetazolamide. A detailed comparison of the obtained structural data with those already reported for other CA isozymes provides novel insights into the catalytic properties of the members of this protein family. On the basis of the inhibitory properties of acetazolamide against various cytosolic/transmembrane isoforms and the structural differences detected within the active site of the various CA isoforms, further prospects for the design of isozyme-specific CA inhibitors are here proposed.

INTRODUCTION Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes, which catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to the bicarbonate ion (CO2 1 H2O $ HCO2 1 H1). These 3 proteins are present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and are encoded by four evolutionarily unrelated gene families: the a-CAs (in vertebrates, bacteria, algae, and cytoplasm of green plants), the b-CAs (predominantly in bacteria, algae and chloroplasts), the g-CAs (in archaea and some bacteria),1 and the d-CAs (in some marine diatoms).1 Human CAs belong to the alpha class; 15 isoforms are presently known, among which 12 are catalytically active (CAs I­IV, CAs VA­VB, CAs VI­VII, CA IX, and CAs XII­XIV), whereas the CA-related proteins (CARPs) VIII, X, and XI are devoid of any catalytic activity.1 CA XV is the most recently reported isozyme, which is expressed in a number of species, but is absent in humans and monkeys.2 CA isozymes widely differ in their kinetic properties, response to inhibitors, pattern of expression in various tissues, and cellular localization. In particular, CAs I, II, III, VII, and XIII reside in cytosol, CAs IV, IX, XII, XIV, and XV are associated with membranes, CAs VA and VB occur in mitochondria, whereas CA VI is secreted.1­10 The a-CA isozymes are widely distributed in many tissues and organs in mammals. Since at these sites CAs play a crucial role in various physiological processes, that is, CO2/HCO32 transport between metabolizing tissues and lungs, pH and CO2 homeostasis, electrolyte secretion, biosynthetic reactions (gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis and ureagenesis), bone resorption, and tumorigenicity,11­15 they have recently become interesting targets for pharmaceutical research. However, most of the available CA-directed pharmacological agents are still far from being optimal drugs. They present various nondesired side-effects, mainly because of their lack of selectivity for the different CA isozymes.1 Thus, developing isozyme-specific or, at least, organ-directed CA inhibitors should be highly beneficial in obtaining novel classes of drugs.

Crystal Structure of Human Carbonic Anhydrase XIII

such a goal have not been very optimistic, because of the high similarity observed between various isozymes. However, recently, a plethora of X-ray crystallographic studies on different isozymes and CA-inhibitor complexes have provided a scientific basis for the rational drug design of more selective enzyme inhibitors.1,14­25 Unfortunately, only the crystal structures of CAs I, II, III, IV, VA, XII, and XIV from different vertebrates have been determined so far.19,25­30 These isozymes contain an essential Zn21 ion, localized at the bottom of a deep active site cleft, coordinated by three conserved His residues and a water molecule. The Zn21-bound water is also engaged in H-bond interactions with the hydroxyl moiety of a conserved Thr residue, which in turn is bridged to the carboxylate moiety of a conserved Glu residue. These interactions enhance the nucleophilicity of the Zn21-bound water molecule, and orient CO2 toward a favorable location for nucleophilic attack. Since a detailed picture of even the most subtle differences in their active sites should be important for the development of drugs with enhanced selectivity, a complete structural characterization of the remaining CA isozymes is strongly encouraged. CA XIII is the most recently reported and characterized CA isozyme in humans.3,31­34 Studies on isozyme distribution in human tissues demonstrated that, similar to CA II, CA XIII occurs in several organs, including thymus, small intestine, and colon. On the other hand, this isozyme is also widely expressed in the testis during all stages of developing sperm cells,3 while CA II is confined to the mature sperm cells.3 Contrarily to CA II, CA XIII also occurs in the uterine cervix and some endometrial glands. Since pH and ion balance have to be tightly regulated in reproductive organs to ensure normal fertilization,3 CA XIII may contribute to reproductive processes by controlling optimal HCO32 concentration and pH homeostasis for the maintenance of sperm mobility. This hypothesis could be tested using CA XIII deficient animal models, but unfortunately these models are not yet available. The physiological functions of CA XIII in other tissues and organs still remain to be elucidated. In this study, we report on the X-ray crystallographic characterization of human CA XIII in the unbound state and in complex with the inhibitor AZA. A detailed comparison of the new structural data with those previously reported for other CA isozymes1 provided additional insights into the catalytic properties of the members of this protein family. On the basis of the information reported here, novel prospects for the design of isozymespecific CA inhibitors are proposed. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression and purification

The full-length human CA13 was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway,

NJ), which encodes a GST-fused protein containing a thrombin cleavage site, as reported previously.31 The full-length human CA13 cDNA in pOTB7 vector (IMAGE Clone 6083105, Geneservice, Cambridge, UK) was used as template for a PCR reaction, in which the full-length sequence was amplified, and BamHI and XhoI restriction sites were introduced (underlined in primers F1 and R1). The forward primer was 50 -CGC GGA TCC ATG TCG AGG CTC AGC TGG GGA-30 (F1) and the reverse primer was 50 -CCG CTC GAG TTA ATG GAA AGA GGC TCT CAC-30 (R1). PCR was performed with Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and using PTC 2000 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The PCR product and the pGEX-4T-1 vector were digested with BamHI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Herts, UK); then, the PCR product was ligated into the vector by using T4 ligase from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant vector encoding GST-CA XIII was transformed into E. coli BL21 strain (Amersham Biosciences) and sequence correctness was confirmed as previously reported.31 Protein expression was carried out in BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 228C for 16 h. 100 ml pellets were lysed in 5 ml of cold PBS containing 1 mg/mL of lysozyme, aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM benzamidine, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4, following incubation at 258C, for 30 min. After sonication, the sample was centrifuged at 15000 rpm, at 48C, for 30 min, and the recombinant protein was purified on 3 mL of GSTrap resin (GE Healthcare), according to manufacturer's suggestions. After treatment with thrombin (GE Healthcare) at 228C for 16 h, the resulting digest was purified on NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) preactivated with pAMBS (Sigma) as reported previously.35,36 Eluted protein was immediately concentrated and loaded on a Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. Highly purified fractions containing hCA XIII were pooled, concentrated to 7 mg/ mL and immediately used for crystallization experiments. Protein purity and concentration was evaluated by SDSPAGE and Bradford method.37 Protein purity and nature were also verified with a Surveyor HPLC system connected on-line with a LCQ DecaXP Ion Trap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, USA) equipped with an OPTON electrospray source operating at a needle voltage of 4.2 kV and a temperature of 3208C. Analysis was performed ° using a 300 A narrow bore 250 3 2 mm C4 Jupiter column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and applying a gradient of solvent B (0.05% TFA in CH3CN) on solvent A (0.08% TFA in H2O) from 30% to 70%, over a period of 40 min. Mass spectra were recorded in the m/z 400­2000 range, in positive mode. Multicharge spectra were deconvoluted using the BioMass program implemented in the Bioworks 3.1 package provided by the manufacturer. Mass calibration was performed using UltraMark (TherPROTEINS

Initial rates of CO2 hydration were measured with an SX.18MV-R Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument (Oxford, UK) by the changing pH indicator method.38 Phenol red at a concentration of 0.2 mM was used as indicator in a buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1M Na2SO4; CO2 hydration reaction was measured reading at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm, for a period of 10­100 s. Saturated CO2 solutions in water at 208C were used as substrate.38 Stock solutions of inhibitor (1 mM) were prepared in 10­20% (v/v) aqueous DMSO; this organic solvent is not inhibitory at these concentrations. Dilutions up to 0.1 nM were done thereafter with water. Prior to assay, inhibitor and enzyme solutions were mixed at 258C, for 10 min to allow the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Triplicate experiments were done for each inhibitor concentration, and the values reported are the mean of such results. Inhibition constants were calculated as previously described.39

The hCA XIII crystals were obtained at 208C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Drops were prepared by mixing 1 ll of enzyme solution (7 mg/ml) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT with 1 ll of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2M ammonium acetate, 0.1M sodium acetate, pH 4.6, used as precipitant buffer, which were further equilibrated over a well containing 500 ll of precipitant buffer. Crystals appeared in the drops within 24 h and grew in about 1 week to maximum dimensions of 0.2 3 0.3 3 0.3 mm. ° A complete dataset was collected at 1.55 A resolution from a single crystal at the temperature of 100 K, using a MAR CCD detector, at the synchrotron source Elettra in Trieste. Prior to cryogenic freezing, crystals were transferred to the precipitant solution with the addition of 15% (w/v) glycerol. Data were processed using the HKL crystallographic data resolution package (Denzo/Scalepack).40 The crystals belonged to space group P21 with ° ° unit cell dimensions of a 5 57.78 A, b 5 58.21 A, c 5 ° , and b 5 92.368. The Matthews coefficient (VM 72.12 A ° 5 2.05 A3/Da) indicated that the crystallographic asymmetric unit contained two molecules according to a solvent content of 40%. The hCA XIII-AZA complex was obtained by adding a 5-molar excess of the inhibitor to a 7 mg/mL protein solution in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM DTT. Co-crystals of the complex were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at 208C by using a precipitant solution whose formula-

tion was very similar to that of the native enzyme (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2M ammonium acetate, 0.1M sodium citrate, pH 5.6). The crystals were then transferred into a fresh precipitant solution also containing 15% (v/v) glycerol prior to flash cooling in liquid N2. The data were collected by copper rotating anode generator developed by Rigaku and equipped with Rigaku Saturn CCD detector. X-ray data were processed as described above. The crystal symmetry corresponds to P212121 space group with unit cell dimensions of a 5 ° ° ° 59.03 A, b 5 81.57 A, and c 5 112.37 A, with two molecules into the asymmetric unit. Data collection statistics are reported in Table I.

Structure determination and refinement

The structure of hCA XIII was solved by the molecular replacement technique using the program AMoRe41 and the crystallographic structure of hCA II (PDB code 1CA2)27 as model template. The rotation and translation functions were calculated using data between 15.0 and

° 3.5 A resolution. The one body translation search, using the centered-overlap function (c-o), on the first 50 rotation solutions led to a single solution with a correlation coefficient of 0.215 and an Rfactor of 0.497. The n-body translation search carried out with the phased-translation function (p-t), by including a PC refinement before each n-body translation search led to find the second molecule. This improved the correlation coefficient and the Rfactor to 0.442 and 0.426, respectively. Refinement of the structure was performed with CNS42 and model building was performed with O.43 Cycles of rigid-body refinement were performed on the model using data between 20.0 ° and 3.5 A resolution. At this stage, the resulting Rfactor and Rfree were 0.412 and 0.426 respectively. Both molecules in the asymmetric unit were refined without NCSrestraints and thermal B-factors were initially fixed at ° 20.0 A2. Many cycles of manual rebuilding and positional and temperature factor refinement were necessary to reduce the crystallographic Rfactor and Rfree values (in the ° 20.00­1.55 A resolution range) to 0.168 and 0.188, respectively. The structure of the hCA XIII-AZA complex was solved by molecular replacement using the hCA XIII structure in unbound state as model template. The rotation and translation functions were calculated using data ° between 15.0 and 3.5 A resolution. Rigid body, positional and temperature factor refinement in CNS resulted in a final model having Rfactor 5 0.178 and Rfree 5 0.217. Data refinement statistics for both structures are summarized in Table I. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the PDB (accession code 3D0N and 3CZV for hCA XIII and hCA XIII-AZA, respectively).

RESULTS
Expression, purification, and structure determination of hCA XIII

Recombinant expression of GST-fused human CA XIII was carried out in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS

strain transformed with a pGEX-4T-1 plasmid containing the full-length human CA13, following induction with 0.1 mM IPTG, for 16 h, at 228C.31 hCA XIII was obtained according to the procedure described in the experimental section, upon removal of the fused GST-tag by thrombin treatment. Purified protein was subjected to LC-ESI-MS analysis, which ascertained an apparent mass value (29585.2 Æ 1.3 Da) in very good agreement with that expected (29587.28 Da). The latter value took into account the presence of a non-natural dipeptide (GlySer) at protein N-terminus, determining a Dm 5 1144 Da with respect to native hCA XIII. Approximately 600 lg of highly purified (>98%) hCA XIII per 100 mL of bacterial culture was achieved; size-exclusion chromatography analysis showed that this protein eluted as a monomer (data not shown). The CO2 hydration activity of the recombinant hCA XIII was measured as previously reported.31 Table II shows the measured kinetic constants, together with those already reported for other human CAs, whose three-dimensional structure is known, that is, CAs I, II, III, IV, and XII. Kinetic constants for hCA VA and hCA XIV have also been included in the table, even though only the three-dimensional structures of the corresponding murine enzymes are known. Inhibition data with acetazolamide, a clinically used CA inhibitor, are also shown. These results demonstrated that the most efficient catalysts for the CO2 hydration reaction for human isozymes were in order CA II > CA IV ! CA I ! CA XIV ! CA XII ! CA VA ! CA XIII > CA III. hCA III, a very poor catalyst for CO2 hydration, was the only isozyme showing lower activity than that measured for hCA XIII. Thus, hCA XIII seems clearly the least active form among the cytosolic CA isozymes with medium activity. On the other hand, the hCA XIII inhibition constant measured for acetazolamide was 16 nM. This result showed that the inhibitor binds to hCA XIII with an efficiency similar to that measured for hCAs II, IV, VA, XII, and XIV, but different to that of hCAs I and III (Table II). To determine the molecular features responsible for these catalytic properties, the high-resolution structure of

three-dimensional model was very similar to that of the best characterized human isozyme, namely hCA II, with all secondary structure elements strictly conserved (Figs. 2 and 3). Accordingly, when superimposing the Ser4Phe260 hCA XIII Ca atoms with those corresponding in ° isozyme II, a very low r.m.s.d. was calculated (0.86 A). However, an accurate analysis revealed a number of small local structural differences between the two enzymes. These differences were localized in the region Ser125Pro129, as a consequence of the Asp126 insertion, and in the region Tyr51-Ser55 (see Fig. 3); thus, they occurred on the molecular surface, far away from the protein active site.

The catalytic histidines and the zinc ion are shown in ball-and-stick representation. The numbering of amino acid residues and the nomenclature of the secondary structural elements refer to that used for the previously solved structure of hCA II.27

the enzyme was solved by X-ray diffraction studies. The enzyme was crystallized in the space group P21 with two molecules per asymmetric unit, designated A and B. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the hCA II structure27 as starting model and refined with the CNS42 program. There were no outliers in the Ramachandran plot,44 and all residues were well defined by the electron density maps. The two independent molecules within the asymmetric unit overlapped quite well; in fact, the superimposition carried out on the Ca positions of all 261 residues led to an r.m.s.d. value of ° 0.56 A. For this reason, the following discussion will be conducted only based on one arbitrarily chosen molecule, unless otherwise stated.

hCA XIII overall structure

hCA XIII appeared as a compact globular protein, whose roughly ovoidal shape is approximately 56 3 39 3 ° 40 A3 in size. Its structure revealed a fold characteristic of other a-CAs, whose three-dimensional structure has been solved,19,25­30 characterized by a central tenstranded antiparallel b-sheet surrounded by several helices and additional b-strands (see Fig. 1). As expected on the base of high sequence identity (60%), the hCA XIII

As observed in the structure of other CA isozymes,19,25­30 the active site of hCA XIII is located in a ° ° large cavity of conical shape, about 15 A wide and 13 A long, which reaches the center of the protein molecule. The zinc ion is located at the bottom of this cavity and is ligated with distorted bipyramidal coordination geometry by three histidine residues (His94, His96 and His119), a water molecule and an acetate ion derived from the crystallization buffer (see Fig. 4). The latter coordinates to Zn21 with one oxygen atom, whereas the other one accepts H-bonds both from the Zn21-bound solvent molecule and the Thr199N atom (see Fig. 4). Binding of this acetate ion is further stabilized by strong ° van der Waals interactions (distance < 4.5 A) between its methyl group and Val121, Val143, Leu198, and Trp209 residues. The occurrence of an acetate ion into the enzyme active site was also observed in the structure of hCA II,46 hCA XII,25 mCA XIV30 and dCA II from Dunaliella salina47 and was considered to mimic the binding of bicarbonate ion product. Similarly to that observed for other CA isozymes, hCA XIII active site occurred as a cavity consisting of two distinct portions made of hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acids. In particular, Val121, Leu198, Ala135, Leu141, Val143, Val207, and Phe131 delimited the hydrophobic region, while Ser62, His64, Asn67, Asp69, Arg91, and Gln92 identified the hydrophilic one. Although refinement was carried out without any NCS-restraints, it is worth noting that all these residues, except His64, adopted an identical conformation within two molecules in the asymmetric unit. As it concerns His64, in molecule A it was well defined in the electron density and directed away from the active site, adopting the so called out conformation. In molecule B, this residue was modeled in two conformations: the first one (more abundant) identical to that observed in molecule A, and the second one with the residue pointing toward the active site (in conformation).48,49 The high conformational flexibility of this residue was already reported for other CA isozymes50 and was associated with its catalytic role as pro-

charged residue (Arg, Lys) at position 91 distinguished hCA XIII, III, IV, and VA from the other isozymes, generally presenting a hydrophobic amino acid at this site. A similar situation also occurred at position 132, where small neutral (hCA XIII, I, II, XII, XIV) or basic (hCA III, IV, VA) amino acids were present. Finally, a Val residue at position 200 clearly distinguished hCA XIII from all other isozymes that always presented a Thr residue at this position (with the exception of hCA I, showing His). Thr200 has been already reported to have an important role for binding of inhibitors to CAs17,18,52­55; this nonconservative replacement could determine specific modifications of the isozyme interaction with inhibitor molecules.

ton shuttle. The observed preference in the present structure for the out conformation is not surprising and is related to the pH used during crystallization.51 At this pH the positively charged imidazolium group is directed away from the active site in order to minimize its electrostatic repulsion from the positively charged Zn21 ion. The unexpected presence of the in conformer, even if in less percentage, may be explained with the presence in the active site of the acetate anion, which partially shields the positive charge of the catalytic zinc. A careful comparison between hCA XIII and other CAs with known three-dimensional structure revealed a general conservation of the nature and conformation of most of the amino acids present within the active site cavity (see Fig. 2). However, amino acid substitutions at positions 62, 65, 67, 69, 91, 131, 132, 135, 136, 200, and 204 distinguished hCA XIII from the other isozymes. In particular, the occurrence of Ser62 was a unique feature of hCA XIII, with respect to isozymes II-IV, XII, XIV presenting an Asn residue and isozymes I and VA presenting, respectively, a Val and Thr residue at this position. A higher variability occurred at amino acids 67, 69, and 204; in the first case, a residue having an amide-containing side chain was present in isozyme XIII, II, VA, and XIV, whereas a basic or hydrophobic moiety occurred in hCA I, III, XII, and IV, respectively. In the second case, acid (hCA XIII, II, VA), hydrophilic (hCA I, XII, XIV) or hydrophobic (hCA III, IV) residues were similarly present. In the third case, practically all amino acid categories occurred. On the other hand, a positively

To detail the binding mode of a classical CA inhibitor to human CA XIII, we determined the crystal structure ° of the hCA XIII-AZA complex at 2.00 A resolution. The complex was crystallized in the space group P212121, with two molecules per asymmetric unit (named A and B). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using native hCA XIII as starting model and refined with CNS.42 A clear electron density for acetazolamide was evident within the active site of each molecule in the asymmetric unit [Fig. 5(A)], which proved nearly identical binding modes. The main protein­inhibitor interactions are schematically depicted in Figure 5(B). According to this fig-

ure, the ionized sulfonamide N atom of the inhibitor replaces the water molecule and the acetate ion coordinated to Zn21 in the native enzyme, with a Zn21-N dis° tance of 2.01 A. Zn21 presents a stable tetrahedral geometry, being also coordinated by the imidazolic nitrogen atoms of His94, His96, and His119. The sulfonamide nitrogen is also involved in a H-bond with the side chain ° oxygen of Thr199 (2.70 A), which in turn interacts with ° the Glu106OE1 atom (2.60 A). One oxygen of the sulfonamide moiety accepts a hydrogen bond from the ° backbone NH of Thr199 (2.78 A), while the other one is ° away from the metal. Several other hydrolocated 3.09 A phobic interactions stabilize the inhibitor within the active site cavity. In particular, the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring establishes a number of strong van der Waals interactions ° (distance < 4.5 A) with residues Gln92, His94, Val121, Leu198, Thr199, and Val200, while the acetamido moiety is stabilized by van der Waals contacts with Gln92, Val121 and Phe131. Van der Waals interactions with residues Ser130 and Val132 of the other molecule in the asymmetric unit also contribute to the stabilization of the inhibitor within the active site [Fig. 5(B)]. It is worth noting that, different from what observed in the native enzyme, the side chain of His64 residue was present only in its out conformation as expected on the base of the pH used in the crystallization as well as on the presence of the inhibitor molecule. As expected, a structural comparison between the hCA XIII-AZA and hCA II-AZA56­58 complexes revealed that

most of the interactions stabilizing the inhibitor within CA active site were conserved in both isozymes. However, the hydrogen bond interactions observed in the hCA IIAZA complex, involving the hydroxyl group of Thr200 and the two N atoms of the thiadiazole ring as well as the Gln92NE2 atom and the carbonyl O of the acetamido moiety, were indeed missing in the hCA XIII-AZA complex. The loss of the first interaction was the obvious consequence of the occurrence of a Val residue at position 200 in isozyme XIII, as discussed in preceding text. The second interaction was lacking as a consequence of the presence of Ser62 in hCA XIII, which replacing the Asn residue occurring in hCA II, was not anymore able to establish interactions with Asn67, which in turn became H-bonded to Gln92. The unique loss of these interactions did not have dramatic consequences on the affinity of acetazolamide for hCA XIII, as suggested by the comparable KI value reported in this case with respect to that of hCA II (Table II). This finding may indicate that a higher number of chemical interactions has to be perturbed to efficiently discriminate between different isozymes.

DISCUSSION Although important advances have been recently reported on the catalysis and inhibition of various CAs, an important and still unresolved issue in this research

field is the complete understanding of the structural determinants of the various vertebrate isozymes contributing to the different catalytic efficiency and response to inhibitors. Based on previous kinetic studies, this protein family consists of very different isozymes including, for example, a perfectly evolved catalyst, CA II,59 a 10-fold less efficient counterpart, CA I,60 and a very inefficient isozyme, CA III (see Table II).61,62 Even greater differences have been observed between isozymes when comparing the KI values measured for certain clinically used inhibitors. Since a detailed picture of even the most subtle differences in their active sites should be important to investigate these issues, a complete structural characterization of the remaining CA isozymes constitutes an important research priority in this field. Accordingly, we report here the three-dimensional structure of

one of the most recently discovered hCA isozymes, namely hCA XIII in the unbound state as well as in complex with acetazolamide. The kinetic characterization of hCA XIII revealed that the catalytic activity of this isozyme was generally lower than that of other cytosolic hCAs, except hCA III (Table II). As an example, the order of magnitude measured for its efficiency with respect to hCA II was quite surprising, since these two enzymes present a high sequence identity and a high degree of amino acid residues conserved within their active sites. The resolution of hCA XIII three-dimensional structure ensured that no backbone rearrangement was present and the protein fold was quite similar to that of other CAs with solved structure, including hCA II (see Fig. 3). In particular, none of the amino acids differing between hCA XIII and hCA II was

directly implicated in catalysis or binding of the substrate. Thus, the observed differences in their catalytic activities must reside in other structural factors. To identify them, we restricted our structural comparison to the cytosolic isozymes, since membrane and mitochondrial CAs contain other peptide regions that may influence the catalytic activity, thus limiting our rationalization. The generally accepted catalytic mechanism for physiological CO2 hydration involves the nucleophilic attack of the Zn21-bound hydroxide to the substrate, optimally activated and oriented in the hydrophobic pocket of the CA active site.59,63,64 Bicarbonate formed in this way is then replaced by a water molecule, with generation of the catalytically inactive form of the enzyme EZn21-OH2. To regenerate the catalytically-active form, a proton-transfer reaction must occur from the Zn21-bound water within the enzyme active site toward the external medium. This reaction represents the rate-limiting step in catalysis, and may be assisted either by His64, a proton shuttle residue present in the active-site of several a-CAs isoforms, or by buffers within the medium.65 In the case of hCA II, the highest catalytic efficiency observed was associated with a unique histidine cluster within the enzyme active site, made of His64, His3, His4, His10, His15, and His17 [Fig. 6(A)].66 This cluster extends from the interior of the active site to its entrance and, finally, to the surface of the protein. It was suggested that this structural motif constitutes an appropriate ``channel'' for efficiently assisting transfer of protons from the active site to the reaction medium.66 Its importance for catalytic efficiency was supported by other kinetic/structural studies on a medium-activity isozyme, namely hCA I.60 In this case, the reduced catalytic efficiency well paralleled with a cluster that was not well defined in the enzyme structure [Fig. 6(B)], as a result of some histidine substitutions between isozymes I and II and a number of additional residues within the active site, namely His67, His200, and His243, placed at bifurcating positions and buried enough to assist only partially proton transfer. The data reported in this study definitively confirm the role of the histidine cluster on the enzyme catalytic efficiency. In fact, the lower catalytic efficiency measured for hCA XIII, with respect to hCA II and hCA I, corresponded to an isozyme structure where the histidine cluster was not at all present [Fig. 6(C)]. In fact, apart from His64, no other histidine residue was present in the channel connecting the active site to the protein surface. The external residues His10 and His15 were placed too distant to ensure a proper proton transfer. The poorest activity measured for hCA III was in line with these observations too. For this isoform, His64, present in all isozymes and acting as the initial proton transfer moiety, was replaced by a Lys residue [Fig. 6(D)]. Also in this case, His10, His15, and His17, confined on the protein surface, were noninfluent for a proper proton transfer.

A detailed comparative analysis of the acetazolamide inhibition constants for various CAs (see Table II) revealed that human isozyme XIII bound acetazolamide with an efficiency similar to that of hCA II, IV, VA, XII, XIV, and significantly higher than that measured for hCA I and III (see Table II). A similar inhibitory trend was observed with other classical sulfonamide inhibitors (MZA, DCP, DZA) using murine CA XIII, hCA I and hCA II33; contrarily, a higher selectivity toward murine CA XIII was detected for sulfanilyl-sulfonamide type of inhibitors.33 To identify the molecular features responsible of such behavior, a careful structural comparison between hCA XIII and the other CAs, with known threedimensional structure, has been performed revealing a general conservation of the nature and conformation of most of the amino acids present within the active site cavity (Trp5, Tyr7, Gln92, Val121, Leu141, Val143, Leu198, Pro201, Pro202, Val207, and Trp209) (see Fig. 2). The amino acid substitutions (at position 62, 65, 67, 69, 91, 131, 132, 135, 136, 200, and 204) distinguishing hCA XIII from other CAs do not justify individually why this isozyme binds acetazolamide with an affinity comparable to that of hCA II, IV, VA, XII, XIV, and higher of that of hCA I and III. Therefore, rather than a specific binding to one of these amino acids, a multiple combination of interactions/repulsions involving all of them has to be evoked to finally explain the inhibition constants measured for each isozyme. Support to this hypothesis comes from the observation that, even though the structural comparison of hCA XIII-AZA and hCA II-AZA complexes reveals the lack of important hydrogen bond interactions in the first one, the inhibitor shows a comparable binding affinity toward both isozymes (see Table II). On the basis of these observations, we can conclude that a comparative evaluation of all possible differences between the active site of all isozymes has to be carefully evaluated to identify structural determinants to be considered in multiple combinations for an optimal design of isozyme-specific CA inhibitors. These compounds will have to simultaneously satisfy eventual steric hindrance, H-bonding and van der Waals interaction/repulsion criteria, for achieving isozyme selectivity.
