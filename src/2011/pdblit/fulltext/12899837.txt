The primary electron transfer (ET) in reaction centers (RC) of Rhodobacter sphaerotdes is investigated as a function of temperature with femtosecond time resolution. For temperatures from 300 to 25 K the ET to the bacteriopheophytin is characterized by a biphasic time dependence. The two time constants of r, ~3.5 kO.4 ps and T*= 1.2kO.3 ps at T= 300 K decrease continously with temperature to values of 71 = I .4 i 0.3 ps and 72 = 0.3 + 0. I5 ps at 25 K. The experimental results indicate that the ET is not thermally activated and that the same ET mechanisms are active at room and low temperatures. All observations are readily rationalized by a two-step ET model with the monomeric bacteriochlorophyll as a real electron carrier.

Introduction

Absorption of light triggers the primary process of photosynthetic energy conversion, a multi-step charge separation. For bacterial systems this primary charge separation occurs in a membrane-bound pigmentprotein complex called the reaction center (RC). The arrangement of pigments and aminoacid residues is known from X-ray structure analysis for the two purple bacteria, Rhodopseudomonm (Rps.) viridis and Rhodobacter (Rb.) sphaeroides [ l-41: In both RCs the pigments are arranged in a very similar way with two branches originating at the primary electron donor, a dimer of bacteriochlorophyll molecules (the special pair P). Starting from P one finds one monomeric bacteriachlorophyll (B), one bacteriopheophytin (H) and one quinone (Q) on each branch. It is commonly accepted that the electron transfer (ET) proceeds only via one pigment branch, the A branch [ 5-71. The symbols BA,HA, and QA refer to the pigments on the active branch. Extensive experimental and theoretical investigations have been published regarding the dynamics and the mechanism of the primary charge separation I g-241. Most

(1)

According to ( 1 ), a direct ET from the excited electronic state P* of the special pair to the bacteriopheophytin HA occurs via a one-step superexchange mechanism. The process is supposed to be mediated by the virtual population of the radical pair P+Bi which is energetically located above P* [ 171. Quite different is the sequential two-step-mechanism: Pa P*LP+Bi& P+H, .
(2)

Here, a real intermediate, quite likely P+Bi, is involved in the ET process. The radical pair P+Bi is placed energetically between P* and P+H, [ 12,13,16]. For the specific situation where the energy of state P"Bi is close to that of P* both reaction schemes are thought to occur in parallel at not too low temperatures [ 241. Several experimental groups have used transient absorption spectroscopy to elucidate the first ET process in the RC. The exceptionally high time resolution and the spectral flexibility available today 471

make the investigation of absorption transients a powerful tool to study complicated multi-step events. In some early publications [ 9, lo] a single time constant of 2.8 ps was reported which was assigned to the reaction scheme ( 1). The experimental data were thought to rule out the two-step-mechanism (2) for room temperature and cryogenic temperatures [ 14,151. More recently we investigated the RCs of Rb. sphaeroides and Rps. viridis with improved signal-to-noise ratio at room temperature. Data were taken with high time resolution over a long time interval and at a large number of probing wavelengths. The results revealed an additional short kinetic component with 0.9 f. 0.3 and 0,65? 0.2 ps for Rb. sphaeroides [ 18,19,25] and Rps. viridis [20,23], respectively. The spectral dependence and the dichroism related to the absorption changes are in accord with a two-step-model, i.e. with the participation of the real intermediate P+B; . In this picture the time constants in (2) have the values ?1=3.5 ps and ~~~0.9 ps (r,=O.65 ps in Rps. viridis). It is the purpose of the present paper to extend our observations of the primary ET to low temperatures. We study the temperature dependence of the two kinetic components between room temperature and 25 K. The experiments are performed in the spectral regions where the nature of the absorption changes is well known and where the two time constants T, and r2 can be determined with high precision.

2. Experimental The measurements presented in this paper were obtained on quinone-depleted RCs from the carotenoid free strain R26.1 of Rb. sphaeroides, if not otherwise stated. The RCs were prepared as described in ref. [ 26 1. They were kept in a 2 mm cuvette in a buffer solution with 56% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotector. The concentration of the RCs was adjusted to OD860values between 0.5 and 1.0 mm-' at room temperature. The low-temperature measurements were performed with a closed-cycle helium cryostatic cooler. A temperature sensor mounted directly on the cuvette allowed the determination of the sample temperature within + 5 K. The roomtemperature data at rl,,=793 nm were obtained on 472

Q,-containing RCs of R26.1 (same optical density in 1 mm cuvettes with stirring). Our femtosecond system is based on an unidirectional ring dye laser providing pulses with a duration of 60 fs at a wavelength of 850 nm [27]. Amplification of single pulses is achieved by a four-stage dye amplifier pumped by a frequency-doubled Qswitched Nd:YAG laser. After a compression stage one obtains pulses of about 80 fs duration and an energy of 30 pJ at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. For exciting and probing the sample each pulse is split into two parts: (i ) In the excitation branch a femtosecond-continuum is generated in a 1 cm water cell. With the help of an interference filter a spectral range between 865 and 885 nm is selected and further amplified in a two-pass amplifier yielding excitation pulses of approximately 2 uJ centered at Iz,,,= 875 nm. After passing a variable delay line and appropriate attenuation the exciting pulse is focused into the sample to a spot 1 mm in diameter. The energy density in the excited area of the sample is less than 150 pJ/cm2. Consequently not more than 15O16 the of RCs are excited by each laser shot. (ii) In the probing branch a femtosecond white light pulse is generated in a 1 mm thick jet of ethylene glycol. A variable portion of this continuum is selected using a special dispersion-compensating monochromator [ 281, which makes it possible to generate probing pulses of adjustable spectral width and with smooth tunability in the spectral range from 500 to 1000 nm. In all experiments presented here the polarization of exciting and probing pulses is parallel. The temporal width of the overall instrumental response function is approximately 300 fs, providing a temporal resolution better than 200 fs. The induced small transmission changes were detected by a sensitive difference-detection system [ 291. Each data point is averaged over at least 500 single laser shots. During data acquisition the delay line is scanned at least five times, during which 100 shots are summed at every delay position for each scan. By comparison of the individual scans and by inspection of the steady-state absorption spectra recorded before and after an experiment, accumulative effects as well as sample decomposition could be ruled out.

3. Results In a first set of experiments the temperature dependence of the decay of the excited state P* is measured. For this purpose the transient absorption change of the special pair is monitored at A,,=920 nm(A+ 10 nm) in the region of optical gain. At all temperatures the signal closely follows a model function with single exponential time constant `cl.In agreement with previous studies [ 8,14,15,30] the observed rate increases as the temperature of the sample is decreased (see fig. 1a). Three time constants are given as examples: For RCs in glycerol the best fit to the data is obtained for TV =3.8 2 0.8 ps at 293 K, 1.55f0.3 ps at 100 K and 1.4kO.3 ps at 25

K. The value at 293 K is somewhat higher than that observed in aqueous solution without adding glycerol (3.5f0.4 ps). A possible explanation for this finding will be given in a forthcoming publication. The main topic addressed here is the temperature dependence of the faster kinetic component that has been detected at room temperature in the reaction centers of Rb. sphaeroides (7*=0.9 ps) and Rps. viridis (7,=0.65 ps) in our recent femtosecond studies [ 18-20,231. It was demonstrated by Dressler et al. [ 231 that the shorter time constant 7, is most clearly observed in the spectral range of the QX transition and the Q,, transition of the monomeric bacteriochlorophylls B. Following the same approach we study the transient absorption changes for reaction centers from Rb. sphaeroides R26.1 for probing wavelengths between 785 and 810 nm at various temperatures. As an example fig. 2 shows the transient absorption changes taken at T= 25 K for three closely lying probing wavelengths on the short wavelength side of the Q, band of bacteriochlorophyll B at Lpr= 794, 795 and 796 nm. It is interesting to see that the kinetic traces differ significantly although the central wavelengths in the three measurements are only 1 nm apart and the spectral width of the probing pulse is 9 nm. The calculated curves in fig. 2 are least-square tits using sums of exponentials,

We emphasize that a model function with the single time constant of TV 1.4 ps obtained from the gain mea= surements deviates significantly from the signal points. Only with a second, faster kinetic component of r2 _ 0.3 ps is a satisfactory fit to the data obtained, The following point is of special importance `for this paper; it explains why we can see very clearly the shorter time constant over a large temperature range. The accurate determination of the extremely short time constant 72is possible on account of the strong wavelength dependence ofthe amplitudes a,(&,).

z, = 1.4 ps has a large negative value, whereas at A,,=796 nm the value of u1 has reversed its sign, being a positive number of the same magnitude. Somewhere between these wavelengths, i.e. for a central probing wavelength of &,a795 nm, the amplitude a, vanishes. The amplitude a2 remains positive throughout the entire wavelength range from 785 to 810 nm. For A,,=795 nm we find indeed a very small value of a, yielding a2/al =7.4. As a consequence the signal is dominated by a mono-exponential decay with a time constant ~~ which can readily be determined with good accuracy to be r2 ( T= 25 K) = 0.3 * 0.15 ps #I. In short, a judicious choice and a precise positioning of the probing wavelength are required to obtain the data reported here. 474

In fig. 3 data with the optimized probing wavelengths Iz,, x&, are presented for 298, 125 and 25 K. As pointed out above, the central wavelength of the different experiments is chosen in such a way that [a,( is as small as possible ( Iall +C lazl) at each temperature. The central wavelength &, shifts from 793 nm at 298 K to 795 nm at 25 K. The exact position of the central wavelength depends critically on the bandwidth of the probing pulse and on the spec-

trum of the sample which is influenced by the temperature and by the cryoprotector. In our experi-

ments with stable pulse properties the temperature dependence of & is probably due to a slight narrowing of the Q,(B)-absorption band with decreasing temperature. The three pictures of fig. 3 show quite clearly the strong decrease of the time constant 72with temperature. 72 decreases from TV=1.2 f 0.3 ps at T=298 K to g=O.6+0.15 ps at T=l25 K and to the surprisingly short value of ~~ 0.3 2 0.15 ps at = T= 25 K. The value of 7z= 1.2 k 0.3 at T= 298 K lies slightly higher than the number of 0.9 f 0.3 ps reported previously [ 18,19 1.

4. Discussion Our transient absorption data are evaluated within the framework of rate equations for the population of spectroscopically well defined intermediates. This procedure is well justified for a non-adiabatic electron-transfer mechanism where the vibrational relaxation is much faster than the electron transfer. In this case one deals with thermally equilibrated, well defined states. For time constants considerably shorter than 700 fs, deviations from non-diabatic ET may become important [ 24 1. In this paper we apply the rate-equation formalism as a first-order approximation for even shorter time constants. We simulate the transient absorption changes by a sum of exponentials (eq. (3)) with time constants 7, and amplitudes a,(&,,). The evaluation of the experimental data according to a rate-equation system supplies a set of time constants 7, which are independent of the probing wavelength. The spectral properties of the intermediates appear via the wavelengthdependent amplitudes ai(J-pr)*It should be pointed out that the el&trochromic shift of the Q,( B)-absorption band of a RC occurs simultaneously with the formation of the radical pair P+H, and is well accounted for by a rate-equation model. For RCs at room temperature we have shown in earlier publications [ 19,23 ] that the wavelength-dependent amplitudes a,(&,) related with the different time constants 7, are well described in a two-step ET model where the radical pair PfB, is a real intermediate. Its formation was taken to occur with zI =3.5 ps, while the faster kinetic component

(7,=0.9 ps) was assigned to the decay of P+B,. More detailed room-temperature measurements in the Q,( B)-band (e.g. fig. 3a) performed in the context of the present study give a refined time constant 7z of 1.2kO.3 ps for quinone-containing RCs in aqueous buffer solution. Recently, some related experiments have been reported in ref. [2 11. Transient absorption data obtained in the same spectral range were analysed with a single-step model. The authors found a similar time constant of T'= 1.1 ps at Apr= 793 nm where - according to our data - the signal decay is indeed essentially mono-exponential. However, the mono-exponential data analysis cannot account for the transient absorption at the neighbouring wavelengths in the range of 765 nmd1,,&792 nmg2. At low temperatures the present experiments yield the following important results: (i) At all temperatures investigated, two time constants 7, and zz with similar amplitude ratios are required to explain the experimental results. (ii ) The reported decrease of the time constant TVwith temperature is corroborated by our data. (iii) Qualitatively similar transient features occur at all temperatures. In detail, the appearance of special transient features is subject to small, temperature-dependent spectral shifts. (iv) The time constant of the faster process becomes shorter with decreasing temperature reaching a very small value of 72=0.3 f 0.15 ps at T= 25 K. (v) The evaluation of the difference cross section in the Q,( B)-band is in agreement with the interpretation of P+B, being a real intermediate also at low temperatures (details will be published soon). The smooth temperature dependence of the two observed decay rates indicates that the essential mechanisms of the electron transfer are not altered upon lowering of the temperature down to 25 K. The increase of the reaction rate constants suggests that molecular reactions related with both processes are activationless. In addition, we believe that the r2 process is not a simple intramolecular vibrational energy relaxation. It is well known from many investigations of large molecules in the condensed phase that vibrational relaxation slows down at low " A satisfactoryfit of the experimental data in this spectral range
requires two time constants r1 and r2 at room temperature [21,25,31]. 475

temperatures [ 32,331. The observation of the reverse temperature dependence of r2 gives a strong argument that the related process is not vibrational relaxation. On the other hand the temperature dependence is understandable if the fast process is an activationless ET step. The most probable mechanism is the stepwise.reaction according to model (2 1, where at first an electron is transferred from P* to the monomeric bacteriochlorophyll B, and in a second, faster step the electron proceeds to the bacteriopheophytin HA. The experimental data may be discussed in the framework of conventional ET theory: The non-adiabatic ET rate is determined by the electronic coupling Vand the thermally averaged nuclear FranckCondon factor F: k= ?!

A temperature dependence of the ET rate may originate from changes in V or in F. For a non-activated process the temperature dependence of F leads to an ET rate [ 341

Here, o is the frequency of the coupling mode and hE is the energy gap for the ET reaction. The index i= 1, 2 refers to the first and second step, respectively. With help of eq. (5) the temperature dependence of the observed rates k, = 1/T, is modeled giving the solid curves in figs. la and lb. The simulation of the slower rate constants k, gives a reasonable fit of the experimental points for k, (0) = 8.1 X 10" s-' and w, /2xc= 90 cm- ' in agreement with Fleming et al. [ 141. Of special interest is the simulation of the rate constants k,. The pronounced temperature dependence of this process below 125 K (see fig. lb) requires a smaller frequency of the coupling mode of w,/2nc=30 cm-' for k2(0)=4.0X 10" s-`. With the parameters listed here the agreement with the experimental data is quite satisfactory. The energy difference A,!?= A.!?,+ A& between the 476

two states P* and P+H, is known to be approximately 2000 cm- ' [ 351. For similar reorganisation energies of the two ET processes [ 36 1, and for a nonactivated first step, the energy difference bEl can be estimated to be greater than 800 cm-`. On the other hand, an upper limit of A/Z,d 600 cm-' was inferred from the magnetic field dependence of the recombination dynamics of P+H, [ 37 1, Using a value A!?] = 700 cm- ' (and A&= 1300 cm- ' ) we obtain from eq. (6) a ratio of the electronic coupling of the two steps of V, /V2=0.5. This estimate can be compared with intermolecular overlap calculations which yielded for RCs from &IS. viridis a value of VI/ V,=O.4 [ 381. The good agreement between the experimental data and the calculated curves indicates that the temperature dependence of the Franck-Condon factor F alone can account for the observed variation of both rates and that there is no need for a temperature dependence of the electronic coupling parameter Vi. An interesting result of the analysis is the observation that the frequencies of the two relevant modes differ by a factor of three, suggesting that different modes are involved in the two ET steps. Despite the good agreement between theoretical and experimental rates one should be aware of the strong simplifications made above for a complex biological system. The following points should be noted: (i) A contraction of the protein upon cooling of the RC may lead to an increased electronic overlap Vi which may in turn account for part of the temperature dependence of the k,. Therefore the values of Wi found above have to be considered as lower limits. (ii) The fast reaction rate is well above (700 fs)- `, thus adiabatic processes cannot be ruled out at low temperatures. Considering the high complexity of the large pigment-protein system a clear distinction between adiabatic and non-adiabatic ET mechanisms does not seem feasible at our present level of understanding. (iii) Our experimental data are shown to be fully consistent with the two-step model (2). Nevertheless other kinetic models may account for the results. Further experimental information and new theoretical ideas are necessary to establish the true electrontransfer process in bacterial reaction centers. In conclusion, we have found that the primary electron transfer dynamics from the special pair to the bacteriopheophytin in reaction centers of Rhodobacter sphaeroides show transient absorption

changes with two time constants at all temperatures from 300 to 25 K. The two kinetic processes are ac#celerated at lower temperatures. The fastest time constant observed is 300 fs at 25 K, which is close to the limit of what can be described by standard electron-transfer theory.
