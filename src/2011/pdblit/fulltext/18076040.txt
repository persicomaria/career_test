ABSTRACT Recent mutagenic and molecular modelling studies suggested a role for glycine 84 in the putative oxyanion loop of the carboxylesterase EST2 from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius. A 114 times decrease of the esterase catalytic activity of the G84S mutant was observed, without changes in the thermal stability. The recently solved three-dimensional (3D) structure of EST2 in complex with a HEPES molecule permitted to demonstrate that G84 (together with G83 and A156) is involved in the stabilization of the oxyanion through a hydrogen bond from its main chain NH group. The structural data in this case did not allowed us to rationalize the effect of the mutation, since this hydrogen bond was predicted to be unaltered in the mutant. Since the mutation could shed light on the role of the oxyanion loop in the HSL family, experiments to elucidate at the mechanistic level the reasons of the observed drop in kcat were devised. In this work, the kinetic and structural features of the G84S mutant were investigated in more detail. The optimal temperature and pH for the activity of the mutated enzyme were found significantly changed (T 5 658C and pH 5 5.75). The catalytic constants KM and Vmax were found considerably altered in the mutant, with ninefold increased KM and 14-fold decreased Vmax, at pH 5.75. At pH 7.1, the decrease in kcat was much more dramatic. The measurement of kinetic constants for some steps of the reaction mechanism and the resolution of the mutant 3D structure provided evidences that the observed effects were partly due to the steric hindrance of the S84-OH group towards the ester substrate and partly to its interference with the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the second tetrahedral intermediate.

INTRODUCTION Esterase 2 (EST2) from the thermophilic eubacterium Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius is a thermostable serine hydrolase belonging to the HSL family of the esterase/lipase superfamily.1­3 Members of this family are ubiquitous (see the ESTHER database at http://bioweb.ensam.inra.fr/esther/), comprise true lipases and amidases other than carboxylesterases and are still poorly characterized. For some of them, a role in lipid catabolism or detoxification has been proposed.4,5 EST2 hydrolyzes monoacylesters of different acyl-chain length, triglycerides of short acyl-chain and different compounds of pharmacological and industrial interest.3,6 The enzyme displays a maximal activity at a temperature of 708C and with pNP-esters having acyl-chain bearing from six to eight carbon atoms.3 Mutagenic7 and structural8,9 studies provided an unambiguous view of the EST2 active site allowing the identification of several subsites in the active center functional architecture, including the catalytic triad (S155, D252, H282), the acyl and alcohol binding pockets, and the oxyanion hole, an electrophilic environment in the immediate vicinity of the catalytic serine. The oxyanion hole is constituted by residues G83, G84, and A156, whose main chain nitrogen atoms act as hydrogen donors to the cleaved substrate, stabilizing the negative charge on the tetrahedral intermediates arising from the nucleophilic attack of the S155.9 Even though sequence analysis studies revealed that the oxyanion hole residues are highly conserved within the a/b hydrolase fold enzymes, in some members of the group the

residue corresponding to G84 of EST2 is a serine10,11 (see the lipase engineering database at http://www.led. uni-stuttgart.de). Accordingly, previously reported structural studies showed that in Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RmL)12,13 and Fusarium solani cutinase (FsC),14 the side-chain hydroxyl group of this serine (S82OG for RmL and S42OG for FsC) contributes to the stabilization of the oxyanion. In a general project aimed at investigating the role of oxyanion hole residues in the hydrolytic effectiveness of carboxylesterases belonging to the HSL family, the G84S EST2 mutant has been expressed and functionally characterized.7 This substitution resulted in a dramatic decrease of catalytic activity but unmodified thermal stability.7 With the aim to better characterize the kinetic behavior of this EST2 variant and to give an explanation to the observed reduced activity, G84S was further analyzed both at kinetic and structural level.

cated pH, containing pNP-esters (100 lM). Stock solutions of pNP-esters were prepared by dissolving substrates in pure acetonitrile. Assays were done in duplicate or triplicate and results were mean of two independent experiments. One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of the protein releasing 1 lM of p-nitrophenoxide/min from pNP-hexanoate at indicated temperature.3 The absorption coefficient used for p-nitrophenoxide was 21,000 M21 cm21 at 708C and pH 7.1, and 8800 M21 cm21 at 658C and pH 5.75.
Kinetic measurements and analysis

Initial velocity versus substrate concentration data were fitted to the Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation, by weighted linear leastsquares analysis with a personal computer and the GRAFIT program16; pNP-acetate and pNP-butanoate ranged from 0.04 to 1.6 mM, pNP-hexanoate from 5 to 180 lM. Assays were done in duplicate or triplicate and results for kinetic data were mean of two independent experiments. In methanolysis experiment, methanol was added in the assay mixture and ranged from 0 to 7% (v/v).
Determination of pH and temperature optima

All chemicals were reagent grade. p-Nitrophenyl (pNP)-acetate, pNP-butanoate, and heptanoyl pNP ether were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MI). pNP-hexanoate was kindly synthesized by Dr. G. Ottolina.
Overexpression and purification of mutant G84S

Wild-type and mutant constructs were used for cell transformation and protein expression as previously described.3
Electrophoretic analysis

Electrophoretic runs were performed with a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II cell unit, at room temperature. 12.5% SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli.15 ``Prestained SDS-PAGE broad range'' (BioRad) was used as molecular weight standard containing: miosin (205 kDa), b-galactosidase (120 kDa), bovine serum albumin BSA (84 kDa), ovalbumin (54 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (36 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (30 kDa), lysozyme (22 kDa), and aprotinin (7.4 kDa).
Esterase activity

The dependence of initial velocity on pH was monitored at 348 nm (the pH-independent isosbestic point of p-nitrophenol and the p-nitrophenoxide ion) with a molar absorption coefficient of 5300 M21 cm21, at 708C. The buffers used were 50 mM Na/citrate over the range 5.0­5.75, 50 mM Na/phosphate over the range 5.75­7.0, and 50 mM Tris/HCl over the range 7.0­8.5. The dependence of esterase activity on temperature was studied over the range 25­758C, with pNP-hexanoate (100 lM) as substrate, in a reaction mixture 40 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.75), containing 4% acetonitrile.
Inhibition by heptanoyl pNP ether

The time course of the esterase-catalysed hydrolysis of pNP-esters was followed by monitoring of p-nitrophenoxide production at 405 nm, in 1-cm path-length cells with a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). Initial rates were calculated by linear least-squares analysis of time courses comprising less than 10% of the total substrate turnover. Assays were performed at 65 or 708C in a mixture of 40 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4/4% acetonitrile at the indi-

Inhibition by ether was evaluated by assaying the activity for the wild-type enzyme at 708C and pH 7.1, using pNP-hexanoate as substrate at the concentration of 7.5 lM (half the KM value) and heptanoyl pNP-ether at three different concentrations: 3.5, 7, and 10 lM. For G84S mutant, at 658C and pH 5.75, pNP-hexanoate was used at 75 lM concentration (half the KM value) and the ether at 35, 70, and 100 lM. The activity was expressed as residual activity with respect to the activity without inhibitor.
Instantaneous bursts of pNP

Bursts of pNP were measured at 405 nm at zero time of assay mixtures containing pNP-hexanoate after addition of EST2 wild-type (range, 2.5­20 ng) or G84S (range, 10­120 ng). The condition used were 4% acetoni-

Steady-state rate constants in Figure 3 are related to the experimental values of KM and kcat by the following equations: kcat ¼ k2 k3 =k2 þ k3 s ¼ kcat =KM ¼ k1 k2 =kÀ1 þ k2 KM ¼ k3 ðkÀ1 þ k2 Þ=k1 ðk2 þ k3 Þ ð1Þ ð2Þ ð3Þ

Resolution of kinetic parameters was done as previously reported.9,17
Binding studies

The affinity of hexanoyl pNP ether was measured by following the variation of intrinsic fluorescence of wildtype enzyme (pH 7.1) and G84S mutant (pH 5.75) upon ether binding. Fluorescence measurements were performed and analyzed as previously reported.9 Measurements of dissociation constants were done at 20, 25, 30, 35, and 408C, in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 4% (v/v) acetonitrile by using a Jasco FP 777 spectrofluorometer. After corrections for buffer and dilution, experimental binding points were computer fitted to a hyperbolic curve by the GRAFIT program.16 The stock solution of heptanoyl pNP-ether was prepared in pure acetonitrile.
Determination of k21 and E21

° ° space group P21212 (a 5 63.66 A; b 5 82.17 A, and ° c 5 47.96 A) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. ° X-ray data were collected at 2.00 A resolution at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) by using one crystal flash cooled to 100 K from the precipitant solution containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. Data were processed with the HKL crystallographic data reduction package (Denzo/Scalepack).18 The statistics of data collection are reported in Table IV. The structure of G84S was determined by the molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe19 and EST2 from A. acidocaldarius (pdb code 1EVQ) as search model.8 Refinement was carried out using the CNS program.20 Several cycles of simulated annealing, positional and B-factor refinement followed by manual rebuilding with the O program21 reduced the Rfactor and Rfree values of 19.6% and 22.2%, respectively. The final model includes 2414 protein atoms and 162 water molecules. The consistency of the protein geometry was validated using Procheck.22 90.6% of residues lies in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, whereas 7.8% lies in additional allowed regions; the catalytic S155 lies in a generously allowed region, as previously reported.8 The statistics of refinement are reported in Table IV. The coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with entry code 2HM7.
Modeling studies

The values obtained for KD were used to calculate k21 using the constants k1 obtained from the Arrhenius plot of the specific constants. The data of k21 were plotted as Arrhenius plot; from the slope of these curves it was possible to calculate E21 for wild-type enzyme and G84S mutant.
X-ray diffraction studies

The starting models of the second tetrahedral intermediates for EST2 and G84S with the octanoic ester have been built on the basis of the EST2-Hepes8 and G84Ssulphate complexes, respectively. In both starting models, the substrate was placed in the active site with its carbonyl carbon covalently bound to Og of S155 and with the C8-acyl chain fitting the cavity known to be the acylbinding pocket. The models were then subjected to energy minimization by using the MOE software package (2004.03; Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Energy minimizations were performed using the Amber94 force field until a final energy gradi° ent of 0.001 kcal/mol/A. During the minimization the catalytic residues (S155, D252, H282), the covalently attached substrate and the residues within a radius of ° 4.5 A from the substrate were set as flexible, while the rest of the system was kept rigid. The geometry and stereochemistry of the minimized models were checked by using the program Procheck.22 RESULTS

Crystals of G84S were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method under the following conditions: 2 lL of protein solution (8 mg/mL) were mixed to an equal volume of precipitant (18% (w/v) PEG 8000, 0.1M Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.2M MgCl2) and incubated at room temperature over 1 mL of precipitant. After about two weeks, crystals of 0.3 mm 3 0.3 mm 3 0.3 mm were obtained. They belonged to the orthorhombic

G84S

All the assays were made in phosphate buffer containing 4% acetonitrile. Substrates were dissolved in pure acetonitrile. Determinations were performed at 708C and pH 7.1 for wt EST2 on pNP-acetate, pNP-butanoate, and pNP-hexanoate and at 658C and pH 5.75 for G84S on the same substrates. For the wild-type enzyme, kinetic parameters were determined also at 658C and pH 5.75, while for G84S mutant the parameters were calculated at 708C and pH 7.1, using pNP-hexanoate as substrate. Results are means of two or three different determinations and each assay was done in duplicate. pNP-acetate and pNP-butanoate ranged from 0.04 to 1.6 mM, pNPhexanoate from 5 to 180 lM.

pNP-hexanoate as substrate, was 66 U/mg (Table I), in good agreement with a previously reported analysis.7 The catalytic activity decreased about 114 times, whereas the KM was substantially unchanged with respect to the wild-type. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) decreased 135-fold (Table I). The effect of the introduced mutation on the pH/activity profile and thermophilicity of the enzyme was analyzed. The pH/activity profile [Fig. 1(A)] showed that the maximum of the mutant activity was observed at pH 5.75, 1.4 pH units lower than the wild-type.3 This result was confirmed by the pH/specificity profile of G84S [Fig. 1(B)] showing a maximum at around 5.75 and a second lower peak at 7.0. Successively, the activity/temperature dependence of the mutant was analyzed at pH 5.75,

showing that the optimal temperature for the mutant activity was 658C, well below the 708C value observed for the wild-type [Fig. 2(A)]. This effect cannot be ascribed to a decreased thermal stability because this property measured at pH 7.1 was unchanged.7 However, to exclude the possibility that the mutant had a different stability at pH 5.75, the thermal stability of the wild-type and mutated enzymes were analyzed at different pHs and temperatures. This experiment (data not shown) indicated that wild-type and mutant display about the same stability at different pHs and in particular both are more stable in slightly acidic conditions. The kinetic parameters for G84S at its optimal conditions of temperature and pH (e.g., pH 5.75 and 658C) were measured by using three different substrates. These

data were compared with those obtained for the wildtype enzyme at its optimal assay conditions (e.g., pH 7.1 and 708C) (Table I). The mutant showed a 14-fold decrease in the kcat value and a 10-fold increase in KM value with pNP-hexanoate as substrate compared to the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) showed a 127-times decrease. However, the specific activity of G84S, at pH 5.75 and at 658C (545 U/mg), decreased less dramatically (about nine times), if compared with the wild-type assayed in the same conditions (4750 U/mg; see below). Since KM value instead increased, the specificity constant was virtually unaffected (see Table I). Similar results were obtained using pNP-butanoate and pNP-acetate as substrates, showing that the mutation had no effect on the profile of substrate specificity. To better understand the relationships between temperature and activity in G84S, the temperature dependence of the kinetic constants KM, kcat and kcat/KM was

measured and compared with that obtained for the wildtype enzyme. As reported in Table II, the KM values measured for the mutant, using pNP-hexanoate as substrate, were rather independent from the temperature used for the assay. In contrast, for the wild-type enzyme the KM values raised increasing temperature showing almost a doubling going from 25 to 77.58C. Finally, the specificity constants peaked for both wild-type and mutant enzymes at their respective optimal temperatures [Table 2 (Supplementary Material)]. To measure some of the constants and activation energies involved in the multistep hydrolytic reaction, data reported in Table 1 (Supplementary Material) were analyzed according to the method suggested by Ayala and Di Cera.17 This method does not require solvent perturbation, like viscosity changes or solvent isotope effects that often affects substrate­enzyme interaction. It is based on the consideration that the dependence of the specificity constant (s) and kcat on temperature obeys the Arrhenius law. By measuring these constants at different temperatures it is possible to derive some of the rate constants (k) associated with the single reaction steps and the relative activation energies.9,17 Data reported in Table 1 (Supplementary Material) were replotted in Figure 2(B) and 2C, as Arrhenius plots. From the slopes of these curves, it was possible to calculate k1,0, E1, k3,0, and E3 provided that the reaction mechanism of G84S with pNP-hexanoate is rate-limited by k3,0, as reported for EST2.9 Therefore, as first step in this analysis, the ratelimiting step in the G84S catalytic mechanism was determined. The general mechanism of an esterase reaction is shown in Figure 3. One simple way to get an idea about the reaction mechanism is to measure the pNP burst,

which is supposed to occur when the enzyme is added to the reaction mixture before the onset of the catalytic reaction, provided that the acid release is slow compared to the alcohol release. By measuring the bursts of pnitrophenol (pNP) at the onset of reaction (see Fig. 4), we observed that both EST2 and G84S displayed a mechanism governed by kcat 5 k3 with pNP-hexanoate as substrate. This suggests that with short substrates, the ratelimiting step is the acid release (k2 ) k3 and kcat % k3). Therefore, from the analysis of the Arrhenius plots reporting log kcat versus 1/T [Fig. 2(B)] and log s versus 1/T [Fig. 2(C)], E3, and E1 were calculated (Table II). To calculate the parameters k21 and E21 related to the dissociation of the Enzyme/Substrate (ES) complex, we exploited the availability of the ether analog of pNP-hexanoate, heptanoil p-nitrophenyl ether. This compound was able to inhibit the activity of EST2 and G84S at nonsaturing concentration of pNP-hexanoate, whereas no inhibition was observed with saturating concentrations (data not shown). We observed a dose-dependent tryptophan fluorescence increase at 339 nm when the substrate analog heptanoil p-nitrophenyl ether was added to both proteins. The saturation curves obtained at five different temperatures allowed calculating KD values (Table III). From these values, being k1 available at each temperature, it was possible to calculate k21 values. Finally, the E21 values were obtained from the temperature dependence of log k21 (see Fig. 5). In Table III, all the computed values are reported. Since, in the deacylation step of the catalytic reaction, a water molecule acts as nucleophile for the release of the acyl from the active site, in presence of molecules more nucleophilic than water, such as methanol, the release of the acyl should be faster and, this being the rate limiting step of the reaction mechanism, there should be a corresponding increase of the related constant k3 (kcat). Therefore, to evaluate the effect of the mutation on the rate limiting step of the catalytic reaction and consequently on the kcat drop, the different sensitivity of EST2 and G84S toward methanolysis was analyzed. The experiment reported in Figure 6 shows that in the mutant the activation due to methanol was lower and was reached at a lower methanol concentration compared to EST2 (see Fig. 6). The observed different behavior of EST2 and G84S with respect to the methanolysis can support the hypothesis of a different orientation of the interacting

To provide an explanation on a structural basis to the G84S kinetic behavior, the high-resolution structure of this mutant was solved by X-ray diffraction. The protein was crystallized as described in the experimental section. The structure was solved by molecular replacement by using the X-ray structure of EST28 as the searching model. The structure was refined using the CNS program20 to a crystallographic Rfactor of 19.6% and a Rfree ° of 22.2% in the 20.00­2.00 A resolution range. The final model consisted of 2414 non-hydrogen atoms and 162 water molecules. Poor electron density was observed for the region D12-P20. The statistics for refinement are summarized in Table IV. The mutant structure consists of a core domain, belonging to the a/b hydrolase-fold family, and two separate helical regions. The first helical region is formed by a 62-residue long insertion between strands b6 and b7 and covers the active site; the second one encompasses the first 46 N-terminal residues. As expected, the core

structure of the G84S mutant is very similar to that of EST2 complexed with one Hepes molecule.8 However, the orientation of the N-terminal region of the mutant with respect to the a/b hydrolase core is strongly different from that found in the wild-type protein. The r.m.s.d. calculated by superposition of all of the corre° sponding Ca atoms in G84S and EST2 is 7.7 A, whereas ° this value decreases to 0.45 A if the fragment A2-F37 is excluded from the superposition. As a matter of fact, residues A2-F37 in G84S move away from the core domain and interact with another symmetry related molecule. In particular, each molecule exchanges this region with a molecule related by a crystallographic dyad axis of symmetry, thus, forming a dimer through a 3D domain swapping mechanism, as previously observed for the unbound form of the M211S/R215L mutant.23 The structural rearrangement leading to 3D domain swapping is related to a conformational change in the F37-P38 peptide bond, that adopts a cis-conformation in the G84S and the unbound M211S/R215L structures,23 and a trans conformation in the EST28 and M211S/R215L-

HDSC9 structures. Consistently, the superposition of all the 309 Ca atoms of G84S onto the unbound M211S/ ° R215L structures yields an r.m.s.d. of only 0.53 A. A careful structural comparison between G84S and EST2 in the region of the active site [Fig. 7(A)] reveals that the geometry of the active site, formed by the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole is well conserved. The replacement of G84 with serine does not lead to any conformational change, neither in residue 84 nor in its neighboring region. Fourier map inspection in the region of the active site reveals the presence of a sulphate molecule, coming from the purification buffer, covalently bound to the catalytic serine through its Og. This feature has already been described for the double mutant M211S/R215L.9 The principal interactions of this ligand with the protein are schematically reported in Figure 7(B). Moreover, the S84Og atom is hydrogen bonded to

The determination of the G84S crystal structure revealed that the reduction in the catalytic rate of the mutant is not due to a structural rearrangement in the catalytic pocket. The role of the G84S mutation in the enzyme activity can be clarified by analyzing the substrate/enzyme interactions occurring during the rate-limiting step of the reaction. Because deacylation is the ratelimiting step in carboxyl-esters hydrolysis both for EST2 and G84S, models of the second tetrahedral intermediate have been built starting from the crystallographic structures of EST28 and G84S. The same octanoic ester has been chosen as a substrate for both enzymes. In model building, the starting orientation of the substrate in the EST2 and G84S active sites was assumed the same as that of the Hepes molecule in the EST2-Hepes complex8 (see Materials and methods). In these starting models, the oxyanion was directed toward the oxyanion hole, formed by G83, G84, and A156 in the wild-type and by G83,

S84, and A156 in the mutant. The models have been subjected to energy minimization to optimize the interactions within the active site and to assess the orientation of the substrate with respect to the active site. The comparative analysis of the tetrahedral-intermediate models showed that the geometry of the active site is substantially similar in both enzymes and that the network of H-bond interactions known to be required for proper catalysis is conserved (see Fig. 8). Despite the introduction of the serine side chain, the backbone nitrogen of residue 84 is still able to stabilize the oxyanionic oxygen in the mutant through the canonical interaction. The S84 side-chain points toward the substrate, with its ° Og atom being 3.27 A far apart from the oxyanionic oxygen of the substrate. However, the geometry of this interaction is unfavorable to the formation of a hydrogen bond. In comparison to the wild-type enzyme, the G84S model shows small backbone conformational rearrangements within the oxyanion hole residues. These rearrangements stem from the fact that some unfavorable interactions between the S84Og and the acyl chain of the substrate must be minimized. Despite these rearrangements, S84Og establishes an unfavorable interaction with the acylic carbon ° nearest to the tetrahedric center [3.45 A; see Fig. 8(B)]. DISCUSSION As well known for the classical serine proteases, hydrolysis by lipases and esterases occurs through the formation of an acyl-enzyme and two tetrahedral intermediates typically stabilized by hydrogen bonds with two or three main-chain amide groups or side-chain amide or hydroxyl groups10­14,24 from the so-called oxyanion hole. In a/b hydrolase fold esterase/lipase group, the glycines corresponding to EST2, G83, and G84 stabilize the transition state with two hydrogen bonds from the amides of backbone. In some lipases of the same group, there is a serine or a threonine at position corresponding to G84.10,11,25 In addition, the analysis of the transition

state from the 3D structures of the Rhizomucor miehei lipase12,13 and the Fusarium solani cutinase14 have demonstrated that serine together with two main chain nitrogen atoms (S82N and L145N for RmL and Ser42N and Q121N for FsC) at this position stabilizes the oxyanion with a hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl group. A serine at this position is also present in lipases from Humicola lanuginose24 and Penicillium camembertii,24 whereas the threonyl hydroxyl group is present in Rhizopus delemar lipase24,26 and Candida antartica B.27 Therefore, a third hydrogen bond comes from the NH of a glycine such for example in acetylcholinesterase28 and Candida rugosa lipase29 or from the side chain of serine or threonine in several lipases.25 In the latter cases, serine or threonine provides two hydrogen bonds. The reason why some enzymes of the family require three backbone amide groups, whereas others require two backbone amide groups and a side-chain hydroxyl group in the formation of oxyanion hole is still matter of debate. In proteases, it has been observed that the strength of the hydrogen bonds in the acyl-enzyme between the oxyanion and the carbonyl is positively related to the increase in the deacylation rate.30 EST2 has three hydrogen bonds and therefore all lone pairs of oxyanion are involved. Accordingly, EST2 possesses a very high turnover rate.3 Recently, the EST2 mutant, G84S, was designed to recreate a lipase-like situation and see the effect of such a change on the enzyme behavior. Our mutation was performed to assess the putative interfering effect of a hydroxyl side chain in the transition state stabilization and/or substrate binding. To our knowledge, no similar attempts have been previously reported. A preliminary functional characterization of this mutant, in the wild-type optimal conditions, showed a 114fold decrease of catalytic activity.7 However, the more detailed kinetic analysis performed in this work shows that G84S has a fourfold regain of activity at the new temperature and pH optima, namely T 5 658C and pH 5 5.75. In these conditions, using pNP-hexanoate as

substrate, a 14-fold decrease in the kcat and a 10-fold increase in KM values were observed with respect to the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, the analysis of the specificity constant (kcat/KM) showed a 127-times decrease with the same substrate. To provide a molecular explanation to the observed change in the features of the catalytic reaction and in the optimal working conditions, the structure of the mutant was solved by X-ray diffraction studies. The 3D structure of G84S strongly resembles that of the wild-type protein except for the formation of a crystallographic dimer by a 3D domain-swapping phenomenon. The close similarity between the G84S and the unbound M211S/R215L mutant structures23 indicates that the formation of the 3D-domain swapping dimer is not related to a specific mutation in EST2. Furthermore, the high B-values observed for residues A2-F37 and the poor definition of the electron density maps in the region D12-P20 clearly confirm that, as for other members of the HSL family,23 the N-terminal cap-region of this enzyme is intrinsically flexible. A careful structural comparison between G84S and EST2 reveals that the geometry of the active site is well conserved and the replacement of G84 with a serine does not lead to any conformational changes. The structural analysis of the mutant active site suggests a preliminary explanation to the observed change in the optimal working pH. In fact, this difference could be ascribed to a change in the acid/base properties of catalytic H282. This residue, which in EST2 presents an estimated pKa of 6.5,3 in this case could show a lower pKa because of the presence in the enzyme active site of the serine 84 hydroxyl group, which alters the network of polar interactions with respect to the wild-type enzyme (see results section), ultimately affecting the acid/base properties of residue H282. The experiments of pNP burst clearly demonstrated that, as in the wild-type, the rate limiting step for ester hydrolysis catalysed by G84S was deacylation,9 therefore to identify the reason for the kcat reduction, second tetrahedral intermediates for both EST2 and G84S were modeled in the respective optimal enzymatic conditions (i.e., pH 5 7.1 for EST2 and pH 5 5.75 for G84S). The analysis of these models allowed excluding a clear-cut distortion of the geometry of the second tetrahedral intermediate in the mutant enough to justify the observed reduction in the rate of the catalytic reaction. However, this analysis clearly showed that, even though the catalytic pocket was still compatible with substrate binding, the presence of serine instead of glycine in the oxyanion hole interferes with binding because of a steric hindrance. Therefore, the S84/substrate interactions observed in the model can certainly account for the reduced affinity of the enzyme for the substrate, leading to an increase in KM value. The latter conclusion is also supported from the measurement of kinetic constants. In particular, k11, which in G84S presents a lower value with respect to the

wild-type, indicates a less favorable association of the ester substrate with the active site, while k21, which is higher in the mutant than in the wild-type, indicates an increased rate of dissociation. The observation that the activation energy (E3) for the reaction is essentially the same in G84S and EST2 allows excluding any drastic changes in the reaction mechanism and confirms that the change in KM stems from the orientation of the ester in approaching the active site. In other words, the enzymesubstrate complexes once formed proceed normally in the reaction mechanism, but the number of productive complexes is reduced due to steric hindrance afforded by S84. A different catalytic behavior is observed for G84S at pH 7.1, where the KM value is similar to that of EST2. Since, in the wild-type enzyme, the KM value at pH 5.75 is essentially identical to that obtained at pH 7.1, and the measure of activation energy and kinetic constant of deacylation step at pH 5.75 revealed the same values obtained at pH 7.1 (E3 5 5.1 Æ 0.5; k3,0 5 1385 Æ 20); it is reasonable to hypothesize that the effect observed in G84S should be strictly related to the introduced mutation. Further experiments such as molecular dynamics at different pHs could allow to rationalize this effect. The above considerations related to the KM changes cannot explain the decrease of the deacylation rate of the catalytic reaction in the mutant, as indicated by kcat. However, the results obtained from the methanolysis experiment suggest that the serine hydroxyl group is able to interfere with the attack of an approaching nucleophile (water or methanol). If this is due to the reduced protonability of His282 or to the formation of a hydrogen bond affecting the correct orientation between the electrophilic carbonyl of the acyl-enzyme and the nucleophile, it needs to be further investigated. In conclusion, our results confirm the role of G84 in the oxyanion stabilization and suggest that the structure around the active site serine is finely tuned so that the introduction of a hydroxylic group interferes dramatically with the network of hydrogen bonds and substrate binding.
