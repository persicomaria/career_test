The structures of three R6 human insulin hexamers have been determined. Crystals of monoclinic m-cresol±insulin, monoclinic resorcinol±insulin and rhombohedral m-cresol±insulin Ê diffracted to 1.9, 1.9 and 1.78 A, respectively, and have been re®ned to residuals of 0.195, 0.179 and 0.200, respectively. In all three structures, a phenolic derivative is found to occupy the phenolic binding site, where it forms hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl O atom of CysA6 and the N atom of CysA11. Two additional phenolic derivative binding sites were identi®ed within or between hexamers. The structures of all three hexamers are nearly identical, although a large displacement of the N-terminus of one B chain in both monoclinic structures results from coordination to a sodium ion which is located between symmetry-related hexamers. Other minor differences in structure arise from differences in packing in the monoclinic cell compared with the rhombohedral cell. Based upon the differences in conformation of the GluB13 side chains in T6, T3Rf and R6 hexamers, the 3 deprotonation of these side chains appears to be associated with the T3R conformational transition.

1. Introduction
Insulin is a polypeptide hormone that is critical for the metabolism of glucose. The biologically active form, monomeric insulin, consists of a 21-residue A chain and a 30-residue B chain linked by two interchain disul®de bonds; one intrachain disul®de bond exists in the A chain. The conformation of the A chain consists of two short -helical segments linked by an extended section of polypeptide chain, while the B-chain conformation consists of a central -helical section ¯anked by two extended regions of polypeptide. In the presence of zinc ions, insulin associates to form a threefold symmetric hexamer (Baker et al., 1988). X-ray crystallographic studies (Bentley et al., 1976; Ciszak & Smith, 1994; Smith et al., 1996; Whittingham et al., 1995; Derewenda et al., 1989; Smith & Dodson, 1992) and spectroÈ scopic studies (Kaarsholm et al., 1989; Kruger et al., 1990; Choi et al., 1993; Brzovic et al., 1994; Bloom et al., 1995) have shown insulin to be an allosteric molecule; the T and R nomenclature is used to describe the different hexamer types (Kaarsholm et al., 1989). In the absence of high chloride ion concentrations or phenolic derivatives, the ®rst eight residues of the B chain adopt an extended conformation producing a T6 hexamer (Baker et al., 1988). In the presence of high chloride or thiocyanate concentrations, residues B4 to B8 in only one trimer are transformed to an -helical conformation, producing a T3Rf hexamer (Whittingham et al., 1995; Ciszak & Smith, 3 1994; Ciszak et al., 1995). In this hexameric form, a continuous

-helix is present from GluB4 to CysB19 in each monomer in the Rf-state trimer. While higher chloride or thiocyanate ion concentrations are ineffective in producing additional conformational transitions in the hexamer, the addition of phenolic derivatives such as phenol, m-cresol or resorcinol will drive the T3R transition to completion resulting in monoclinic (Derewenda et al., 1989) or rhombohedral (Smith & Dodson, 1992; Whittingham et al., 1998) crystals containing R6 hexamers. In contrast to the `frayed' Rf conformation, the `pure' R conformation contains a continuous -helix from PheB1 to CysB19. However, not all phenolic derivatives are capable of driving the T3R transition to completion, as methylparaben (Whittingham et al., 1995), 4H -hydroxyacetanilide (Smith & Ciszak, 1994) and p-hydroxybenzamide (Smith et al., 1996) are found as complexes in T3Rf insulin. Hexameric insulin will also crys3 tallize in several different crystalline forms. Rhombohedral crystals in which the threefold axis of the hexamer is coincident with the crystallographic threefold axis have been reported for T6, T3Rf and R6 hexamers, while R6 insulin 3 hexamers will also crystallize in the monoclinic system. Reported here are the crystal structures of three R6 human insulin hexamers: two monoclinic forms complexed with either m-cresol or resorcinol and one rhombohedral form complexed with m-cresol. These structures provide further details of the interactions between phenolic derivatives and the residues within the phenolic binding site and also identify additional sites in which phenolic derivatives can bind to the hexamer.

experiments had dimensions ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mm on an edge. In the resorcinol±insulin crystallization, both rhombohedral and monoclinic crystals were present in the test tubes.
2.2. Data measurements 2.2.1. m-Cresol±insulin complexes. Small crystals of both the rhombohedral and monoclinic forms were immersed in paraf®n oil in a depression plate. A loop was used to slide the crystal along the bottom of the well, which caused any remaining mother liquor surrounding the crystal to adhere to the well surface. The crystals were picked up in a loop, plunged into liquid nitrogen and transferred to a goniometer head on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV and RU-200 rotating-anode generator equipped with Osmic confocal mirrors and an MSC X-Stream low-temperature system. Integration, scaling and merging of the data were performed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The resulting independent data were then processed further using SORTAV, BAYES and LEVY (Blessing, 1997) to reformat the data, to apply Bayesian statistics to the weak data and to estimate the scale factor and overall isotropic temperature factor, respectively. Unit-cell, space-group and data statistics are given in Table 2. 2.2.2. Resorcinol±insulin complex. A crystal approximately 0.5 mm on an edge was mounted in a glass capillary along with a small drop of mother liquor. Data were measured at room temperature on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC image-plate system and RU-200 rotating-anode generator with graphite monoÊ chromated Cu K radiation (! = 1.54178 A). The integration,

2.1. Crystallization

Insulin was provided by Lilly Research Laboratories as crystalline biosynthetic human insulin complexed with zinc. Buffers, salts and other reagents were purchased and used without further puri®cation. The reagents listed in Table 1 were added in the order given, the pH was raised to approximately 9.0 with sodium hydroxide to ensure complete dissolution and hydrochloric acid was used to back-titrate to the ®nal pH. The solutions were transferred to test tubes, warmed to 323 K, placed in a Dewar and allowed to stand undisturbed for one week. The resulting crystals from all three

1989). The initial model for the resorcinol complex with insulin was constructed by excluding all non-protein atoms from the structure of the phenol complex (PDB code 1znj) as well as B1±B3 and B28±B30 from all six B chains. An initial Fo À Fc map clearly indicated the positions of both zinc ions, both chloride ions and seven resorcinol molecules. These atoms and molecules were included in the model and the re®nement was begun with PROFFT (Finzel, 1987; Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980) using data in the resolution Ê range 8.0±1.9 A resolution and F ! 2.5'(F). As the re®nement progressed, 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps were examined with CHAIN (Sack, 1988), appropriate adjustments were made to main-chain and side-chain atoms and water molecules were added in accord with good electron density and the formation of hydrogen bonds to other atoms. At the end of the re®nement, the residual was 0.190 for 21 837 data. However, a check of the geometry with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) showed that the restraints had been too loose. The re®nement was continued with CNS using all data, applying an overall anisotropic temperature-factor correction, a bulk-solvent correction and using maximum-likelihood torsion-angle dynamics, conjugate-gradient re®nement or È individual temperature-factor re®nement (Rice & Brunger, 1994; Brunger et al., 1998; Adams et al., 1997; Pannu & Read, 1996). Bond distances between zinc ions and chloride ions and between zinc ions and N42 of the HisB10 residues were restrained. Approximately 10% of the data were reserved for cross validation and were not included in the re®nements È (Brunger, 1992). ' A-weighted 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps as È implemented in CNS (Read, 1986; Brunger et al., 1997) were carefully examined at the end of each round of re®nement and the geometry was monitored with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Adjustments were made to main-chain and sidechain atoms, additional groups were added if necessary and water molecules were added in accord with good electron density and the formation of hydrogen bonds to existing atoms. Maximum-likelihood torsion-angle dynamics omit È maps (Hodel et al., 1992; Rice & Brunger, 1994; Read, 1986; È Brunger et al., 1997) were calculated to verify disordered side chains and other portions of the structure that were problematic. Towards the end of the re®nement, a persistent 5' Fo À Fc peak was observed between two symmetry-related hexamers and adjacent to three protein O atoms. Since the only cations present are zinc and sodium, this peak was interpreted as a sodium ion. At the conclusion of the re®nement, the ®nal model consisted of 2339 protein atoms, eight resorcinol molecules, two zinc ions, two chloride ions, one sodium ion, 146 waters at unit occupancy, 27 waters with partial occupancy and nine disordered residues containing a total of 77 atoms. Residues which were modeled with two discrete conformations were ValB12.1, PheB25.1, GluA4.2, GlnA5.2, ValB12.4, SerA9.5, GluB13.6, AsnB3.6 and ArgB22.6.1 The electron density for PheB25.3 and PheB25.4
The decimal portion of the residue number, 0.1 to 0.6, refers to the monomer number in the hexamer and to A chains (A, C, E, G, I and K) and B chains (B, D, F, H, J and L), respectively, in the deposited coordinates. Smith et al.

was very weak and therefore these side chains were assigned occupation factors of 0.5. Owing to high thermal motion and disorder, the side chains of residues TyrA14.1, GluB21.1, LysB29.1, PheB1.2, LysB29.2, LysB29.3, LysB29.4, LysB29.5 and PheB1.6 could not be located. No electron density was found for the N-terminal residue, PheB1.3, or for the six C-terminal ThrB30 residues. Re®nement statistics are given in Table 3. 2.3.2. Monoclinic m-cresol±insulin complex. The starting coordinates for the re®nement of the m-cresol complex with insulin consisted of only the protein coordinates from the ®nal re®ned structure of the resorcinol complex, as described above. 10% of the data were reserved for cross validation and È were not used during the re®nement (Brunger, 1992). The hexamer was subjected to rigid-body re®nement in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998; Pannu & Read, 1996; Adams et al., 1997) using an anisotropic overall temperature correction and a bulk-solvent correction and yielded a residual of 0.363. È 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc ' A-weighted maps (Read, 1986; Brunger et al., 1997) were calculated and clearly showed the positions of the pair of zinc and chloride ions as well as six m-cresol molecules. The re®nement was continued as described above and bond distances involving zinc were restrained. As was observed in the resorcinol complex, a 5.5' Fo À Fc peak was interpreted as a sodium ion. At convergence, the ®nal model consisted of 2355 protein atoms, seven m-cresol molecules, two zinc ions, two chloride ions, one sodium ion, 218 waters molecules with unit occupancy, 22 water molecules with partial occupancy and seven disordered side chains. No electron density was found for the side chains of any of the B-chain lysyl residues, as well as GluB21.1, GluB21.3, ThrB30.3 and PheB1.6; ®ve of the six C-terminal ThrB30 residues could not

be located. Three side chains were modeled in regions of very weak density and were assigned occupation factors of 0.5 and include TyrA14.1, TyrA14.6 and GluB21.6. Seven side chains were modeled in two discrete conformations and include GluB13.1, GlnA5.2, GluB13.2, ArgB22.4, SerA9.5, GluA4.6 and SerB9.6. One m-cresol molecule was observed in two orientations. Re®nement statistics are given in Table 3. 2.3.3. Rhombohedral m-cresol±insulin complex. Although the structure of the rhombohedral phenol complex with insulin has been published (Smith & Dodson, 1992), the Ê resolution of this structure was only 2.5 A. For this reason, monomers 1 and 2 from the monoclinic resorcinol structure were optimized by a least-squares procedure (Smith, 1993) to the known structure of the rhombohedral insulin±phenol complex. The starting model consisted of an insulin dimer, two zinc ions, two chloride ions and two m-cresol molecules. 10% of the data were reserved for cross-validation and were not È included as part of the working set of data (Brunger, 1992). Rigid-body re®nement using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998; Pannu & Read, 1996; Adams et al., 1997), employing an overall anisotropic temperature factor and a bulk-solvent correction, converged at a residual of 0.378. The structure was re®ned using the protocol described above except that bonds involving zinc were not restrained. At convergence, the ®nal model consisted of 757 protein atoms, two zinc ions, two chloride ions, three m-cresol molecules, 86 waters with unit occupancy, four partially occupied water molecules and three residues with disordered side chains. No electron density was found for the side chains of GluA4.1, TyrA14.1, GluB21.1, PheB1.2 and for the C-terminal residues LysB29.1, ThrB30.1, LysB29.2 and ThrB30.2. Residues whose side chains were modeled in two discrete conformations include ValB18.1, ThrA8.2 and ArgB22.2. Re®nement statistics are given in Table 3.

3. Discussion
3.1. Hexamer packing

The hexamers in both the monoclinic and rhombohedral complexes adopt R6 conformations. The packing of the hexamers in the rhombohedral cell (Fig. 1a) is quite different from that of the monoclinic unit cell (Fig. 1b). In the rhombohedral unit cell, the threefold axis of each hexamer is coincident with the crystallographic threefold axis and each hexamer in Fig. 1(a) is related to its neighbors by the rhombohedral centering condition. Because of high thermal motion and disorder, the C-terminal residues of both B chains, LysB29 and ThrB30, could not be located and these residues could potentially form interactions with a translationally related hexamer. In addition to many water-mediated hydrogen bonds between hexamers, two hydrogen bonds are observed between hexamers related by the c axis translation, Ê PheB1.2 N to ThrA8.1 O (2.83 A) and PheB1.1 N to Ê ). An additional hexamer±hexamer ThrA8.2 O (3.08 A contact, related by the 31 axis, exists between ThrB27.1 O1 Ê and AsnA18.2 O1 (2.67 A).

In contrast, the interactions between hexamers in the monoclinic unit cell (Fig. 1b) are much more complicated. The local threefold axis of one hexamer is perpendicular to that of its symmetry-related mate and is nearly parallel to the (110) plane. More than half of the hydrogen-bonded contacts between hexamers involve residues A14.2±A18.2 and A14.3±A21.3. There are no main-chain/main-chain contacts, but 24 of the 36 hydrogen-bonded contacts involve side chains and 17 of these are asparagine side chains. A complete list of hydrogen-bonded contacts is given in Table 4. An additional interaction in the crystal which has not been observed in insulin structures previously involves a sodium ion which adopts approximately octahedral coordination. The coordination sphere of the sodium ion consists of PheB1.5 O, AsnB3.5 O1, a symmetry-related AsnA21.2 OXT and three water molecules; sodium±oxygen distances range from 1.95 to Ê 3.04 A. Through these interactions, the sodium ion contributes to stabilizing the packing of the hexamers in the monoclinic crystal.
3.2. Monomer conformations

B11±B19 of all six monomers. Additionally, the monoclinic m-cresol and resorcinol structures were superimposed on the monoclinic phenol structure (PDB code 1znj) and the rhombohedral m-cresol structure was superimposed on the AspB28 insulin mutant complexed with m-cresol (Whittingham et al., 1998; PDB code 1zeh). The results shown in Table 5 reveal that the differences between any of the structures are small, with the monoclinic versus resorcinol being the smallest. The slightly larger displacements for the monoclinic m-cresol complexes are most likely to be a consequence of the presence of the hydrophobic methyl group, which induces displacements of water molecules within the phenolic binding site as well as small perturbations in the structure of the hexamers. The largest difference is observed for the B28 mutant insulin and is most likely to be a consequence of the replacement of proline by aspartate.
3.3. Phenolic derivatives

Five of the six ValB2 residues in the monoclinic structures and both of the ValB2 residues in the rhombohedral structure adopt an -helical conformation, resulting in a continuous -helix from PheB1 to CysB19. In contrast, ValB2.5 has 9/2 torsion angles of À85.1/+40.5 and À96.4/+40.8 for the monoclinic resorcinol and m-cresol complexes, respectively, Ê which displaces the PheB1.5 C by approximately 6 A relative to the remainder of the B-chain -helical N-termini. In this orientation, PheB1.5 O is able to coordinate to the sodium ion as described above and the resulting conformation is quite different from the Rf conformation (Ciszak et al., 1995) observed in T3Rf structures. 3 The three structures reported here were superimposed in pairs by a least-squares procedure (Smith, 1993), minimizing the displacement of the backbone atoms of A11±A19 and

Each hexamer contains six phenolic derivatives in the six binding pockets. The phenolic hydroxy group forms a hydrogen bond to the O atom of CysA6 of each hexamer, with Ê a mean distance of 2.61 (9) A; a second hydrogen bond exists between the phenolic hydroxy group and the amino group of Ê CysA11 with a mean distance of 2.87 (8) A. In contrast to that observed for a series of mutant insulin structures (Berchtold & Hilgenfeld, 1999), phenolic hydrogen-bonded distances in trimer I were comparable to those in trimer II. In the case of resorcinol, the second hydroxy group interacts with a water molecule with an average hydrogen-bonded distance of Ê 2.64 (9) A; this water molecule in turn forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl O atom of CysA11, with a mean distance of Ê 2.82 (12) A. The local environment and electron density for a typical resorcinol and m-cresol molecule in the monoclinic structures are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. Several additional phenolic derivative molecules were located in the three structures. In the resorcinol±insulin complex, one resorcinol molecule resides in the channel that leads from the zinc ion binding site to the surface of the

hexamer. Within this channel, the resorcinol molecule forms several hydrogen bonds to water molecules as well as to AsnB3.3 O1. The position of this resorcinol molecule is very similar to that reported for a phenol in the GlyA21, ArgB31, ArgB32 (Berchtold & Hilgenfeld, 1999), where the phenol molecule forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of GluA17 in a neighboring hexamer. This difference in hydrogen bonding may be a consequence in part of the presence of an additional hydroxy group in resorcinol as well as to the presence of mutations to the insulin hexamer. The channel on the opposite side of the hexamer contains only water molecules. In the case of the two m-cresol±insulin complexes, both channels contain only water. An m-cresol molecule was found to occupy a position beneath a pair of tyrosine side chains, A14.1 and A14.4, in the monoclinic structure, similar to that observed in the AspB28 insulin mutant complexed with m-cresol (Whittingham et al., 1998). A resorcinol molecule in the monoclinic structure and an m-cresol molecule in the rhombohedral structure were also observed in this position, even though no electron density was present to model one of the tyrosine side chains in the pair, presumably because of disorder. In all three cases, the electron density for the phenolic derivative was weak and it is likely that the molecule is also disordered. Owing to the threefold symmetry, three such sites exist in the rhombohedral structure. In the complex with m-cresol in the monoclinic structure, the other two sites are empty and exposed to the solvent region, owing to a 180 rotation about the 11 torsion angle of both pairs of tyrosine side chains. In the complex with resorcinol, both other sites are also empty; three of the tyrosyl side chains adopt conformations similar to those in the m-cresol monoclinic structure, while the fourth side chain adopts a conformation similar to that of the rhombohedral structure. However, in this latter case the density for the side chain is poor and it is likely that the side chain is disordered.

threefold axis while the R-state carboxyl groups are directed towards the threefold, shown in Fig. 3(b). In this orientation, the closest contact between a pair of GluB13 O atoms is Ê 3.07 A.

There is evidence to suggest that the GluB13 side chains play an important role in the T3R conformational transition. The mutation of GluB13 to Gln results in the spontaneous formation of a T3Rf hexamer in the absence of zinc or high 3 chloride concentrations (Bentley et al., 1992). In ultrahighÊ resolution (1.0 A) studies of T6 insulin (Smith, Pangborn & Blessing, unpublished data), the GluB13 side chains are oriented such that the planes of the carboxyl groups are nearly parallel (Fig. 3a) to the crystallographic threefold axis. In this Ê orientation, a contact of 2.50 A exists between a pair of O42 atoms from two independent monomers, strongly suggesting the presence of a hydrogen bond. While one would expect a glutamic acid residue to be unprotonated at the pH at which the crystals were grown, it has been noted that the pKa of GluB13 is signi®cantly increased in the hexameric state (Kaarsholm et al., 1990). Following the conversion of one T-state trimer to Rf, producing a T3Rf hexamer (Ciszak & Smith, 1994), the T-state 3 GluB13 carboxyl groups retain their relative orientation to the

Owing to the loss of crystallographic threefold symmetry in the monoclinic structures the situation is much more complicated, and while several of the GluB13 side chains were modeled in two discrete conformations, the appearance of the electrondensity maps suggests that additional disorder is most likely present. In the m-cresol±insulin and resorcinol±insulin GluB13 conformations shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), respectively, the planes of the carboxyl groups are again nearly parallel to the local threefold axis, and in this orientation the groups form hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl O atom and O of SerB9 residues in an adjacent monomer. The closest contact between GluB13 O atoms is Ê 3.84 A for the resorcinol complex Ê and 3.86 A for the m-cresol complex. The closest contact between GluB13 O atoms in the rhomboÊ hedral m-cresol complex is 4.36 A and the overall arrangement of the side chains is similar to that observed for T3Rf hexamers (Fig. 3 3e). As was the case in the monoclinic structures, the electron density in the vicinity of the B13 side chains was less than optimal in spite of the crystallographic threefold symmetry, suggesting additional disorder and high thermal motion. T6 and T3Rf hexamers are typically crystallized at a pH 3 between 6.1 and 6.4. While the pH for the monoclinic R6 crystals was slightly higher (6.6), the rhombohedral R6 form was crystallized at a considerably higher pH (8.5) and protonation of the GluB13 carboxyl groups would be unlikely at this pH. In this crystalline form the B13 carboxyl groups have the largest separation, which is a consequence of charge repulsion of the negatively charged side chains. The T3R transition does not introduce any steric constraints in the central portion of the hexamer where the B13 carboxyl groups reside. Hence, these results suggest the possibility that deprotonation of the GluB13 carboxyl groups is associated with the T3R transition in both T3Rf and R6 hexamers. 3

4. Conclusions
The results presented here clearly show that m-cresol or resorcinol are capable of driving the T3R transition to completion to produce an R6 hexamer in both monoclinic and

rhombohedral space groups. The binding of these phenolic derivatives in the phenol-binding site is accompanied by the typical hydrogen-bonding pattern previously observed between the phenolic derivative and the carbonyl O atom of CysA6 and the N atom of CysA11. In the case of resorcinol, an additional water-mediated hydrogen bond exists between the second hydroxy group and the carbonyl O atom of CysA11. One additional phenolic binding site beneath a pair of TyrA14 side chains is common to all three structures, while a second additional binding site in the zinc ion channel is only observed in the complex with resorcinol. Unlike the T3Rf hexamers, in 3 which the disul®de torsion angles show a wide variation, these torsion angles in the R6 structures are relatively constant and show no evidence of disorder. Differences in the side-chain orientations of the GluB13 residues in T6, T3Rf and R6 3 hexamers suggest that as a result of the T3R transition the carboxyl group is deprotonated, resulting in a larger separation of the charged groups.
