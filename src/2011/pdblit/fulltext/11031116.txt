form. The reaction is then stopped as described above, MN-protected DNA fragments purified from an ethidium bromide-stained 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, 23 and the protected fragments 32p end_labeled.23 Following exposure to REs that have cleavage sites within the substrate DNA, electrophoresis is used to separate the resulting DNA fragments to single nucleotide resolution. If nucleosome assembly occurred at random locations, then all regions of the substrate DNA molecule will be present in the MN-protected 65-70 bp population of fragments. An autoradiogram of the restriction digests will show a continuum of bands that extend from the ends of the MN-protected fragments to the cleavage site (Fig. 3C). However, fewer bands will be observed if archaeal nucleosomes assembled at only a few locations on the substrate DNA, and the presence of only two bands would indicate the presence of a single nucleosome assembly site. In this case, the ends of the protected fragment can be identified based on their distance from the cleavage site, plus or minus any single-stranded nucleotide overhangs generated by the RE. After the RE digestion and electrophoresis, four single-stranded DNA fragments are present in the gel, but only two are labeled and therefore visible by autoradiography. The position of assembly should be confirmed, if possible, by using a second RE; however, some REs exhibit limited cleavage if their recognition sequence is located very close to the end of the MNprotected DNA fragment.

Introduction The chromatin of the archaea Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Sulfolobus solfataricus contains a number of small basic proteins ranging in molecular weight from 7000 to 10,000.1 The 7-kDa proteins have been the most studied and are believed to be important in DNA compaction and stabilization of duplex DNA at the growth temperatures of 75 ° for S. acidocaldarius and 80 ° for S. solfataricus. 2-9 They

have been shown to relieve positive supercoiling in DNA. l0 Other enzyme activities associated with these proteins include RNase,ll' 12 "disulfide bond forming,"13 ATPase, 14 and chaperone activity. 14 The 7-kDa chromatin proteins of S. acidocaldarius consist of five species, designated SacTa, b, c, d, and e in order of increasing basicity. 2'3'7 Sac7d (molecular weight 7477) and Sac7e (molecular weight 7338) differ by six amino acid residues and are coded by distinct genes 5 (Fig. 1). Sac7a and b are carboxy-terminal truncated forms of the Sac7d. Only one form of Sso7 has been characterized; it is referred to as Sso7d ( M W 7019) based on homology to Sac7d. 6 The 7-kDa Sulfolobus chromatin proteins are especially amenable to studies of both protein stability and DNA-binding. 5'15-17 They unfold reversibly over a wide range of temperature, pH, and salt concentration, thus permitting an extensive characterization of thermophile protein stability.17 In addition, they bind to D N A with a relatively small site size, which facilitates a detailed study of the energetics of DNA-binding by site-directed mutagenesis. The structures of recombinant Sac7d 18 (Fig. 2) and native S s o 7 d 19 have been determined by N M R and are similar with a 3.2 ~ root mean square deviation of main-chain atoms. Although the proteins are small, they contain significant secondary structural elements, including an N-terminal two-stranded [3 ribbon, a three-stranded 13 sheet, and a C-terminal a helix with intervening single turns of 310 helix. The interface between the elements forms a hydrophobic core of 10 residues. They have been shown to be homologous to a large group of proteins in eukaryotes known as chromo domains. 2° The N M R structure of Sso7d complexed with D N A shows significant unwinding of the D N A resulting from binding of the three stranded 13 sheet against the minor groove. 21 Unfortunately, the protein 6 T.

affinity for short DNA oligomers is not strong enough to permit observation of a unique 1 : 1 complex in solution, so that data were collected under conditions of fast exchange with excess DNA leading to a mixture of species. The structures of both Sac7d and Sso7d DNA-protein complexes have also been determined by X-ray crystallography 22,23 (Fig. 3). These differ significantly from the NMR structure in that both proteins bend the double helix into the major groove by approximately 70 ° because of the intercalation of valine-25 and methionine-28. The induced bend is the largest bend observed to date at a single protein-DNA site. In contrast, the protein structure is only slightly modified on binding. Names other than Sac7 and Sso7 have been used to refer to the 7-kDa Sulfolobus DNA-binding proteins.

Growth of Sulfolobus
An initial cell culture of Sulfolobus is obtained by inoculating 10 ml Brock's medium, 26 supplemented with 0.2% sucrose with 1.0 ml of frozen cells. The culture is aerated with slow orbital oscillation in a temperature-regulated oil bath at 75 ° (S. acidocaldarius) or 80 ° (S. solfataricus). After 1 day, 200 ml of Brock's medium with 0.2% sucrose is inoculated with this culture and grown overnight

The next day the 200 ml culture is used to inoculate 16 liters of DeRosa's medium, 27 supplemented with 0.1% glucose and 0.1% glutamic acid in a VirTis glass fermentor preheated to 75 ° (S. acidocaldarius) or 80 ° (S. solfataricus). Temperature is regulated with a water-circulating bath flowing through a submersed stainless steel coil. The 16-liter culture is aerated with a slow flow of air through a bubbling stone. Cells are grown to an A600 of 1.0 in about 5 days and harvested by centrifugation at 4500g in 1 liter bottles for 15 min in a Beckman J6B centrifuge at 4 °. The pelleted cells can be stored at - 7 0 °.

Overexpression in E. coli
A pET-3b expression vector containing the Sac7d or Sso7d gene has been constructed 5 and transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. 28 The pLysS plasmid is essential due to the toxicity of Sac7d in E. coli.

yeast extract) by standard methods. 29 For protein preparation, a 20 ml culture of the transformant is grown overnight in LB broth containing 50 p~g/ml ampicillin at 37 °. From this, 4.0 ml is used to inoculate 200 ml of fresh medium. At an A60oof 0.3 to 0.6, 25-mi aliquots are used to inoculate 6 flasks each containing 1 liter of new medium; the flasks are then incubated at 37 °. Sac7d expression is induced when the A600 reaches a value of 0.8 to 0.95 by adding isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.4 raM. After 1 hr the cells are harvested by centrifugation in 1 liter bottles at 4500g for 15 rain in a Beckman J6B centrifuge at 4 °.

Protein Isolation and Purification
Cells are suspended in lysis buffer [10 mM Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA] using 100 ml per 6-liter E. coli culture and 200 ml per 16-liter Sulfolobus culture. Frozen cells are slowly thawed with cold lysis buffer, and the suspended cells are lysed with brief sonication on ice. DNase I (5 mg/100 ml) is added to lysed Sulfolobus cells, and the suspension is incubated at 37 ° for 5 min. Cellular debris is removed by centrifugation at 280,000g for 60 min at 4 °. The supernatant is cooled on ice and dialyzed in SpectraPor CE (1000 molecular weight cutoff) tubing against 0.2 M H z S O 4 overnight at 4 °. Precipitated protein is removed by centrifugation at 180,000g for 30 min at 4 °, and the supernatant is dialyzed with three changes against 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) with 1 mM EDTA. Any additional precipitate is removed by centrifugation at 180,000g for 30 min at 4 °, and the protein is purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Pharmacia Hi-Trap SQ column with a linear 0.0 to 0.5 M NaC1 gradient. Sac7 and Sso7 elute at approximately 0.3 M NaC1. Further purification can be accomplished by gel exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-100-HR but is generally unnecessary. Typical yields are 50 mg of protein from either 16 liters of Sulfolobus culture or 6 liters of E. coli culture. P r o p e r t i e s of P u r i f i e d P r o t e i n s

Nonreducing SDS gel electrophoresis3° can be used to monitor the identity and purity of the 7-kDa proteins. Recombinant Sac7d shows a single band consistent with a molecular weight of 7600 that comigrates with the mixture of Sac7 native proteins. The band is absent in preparations from E. coli cells lacking the recombinant plasmid. Recombinant Sso7d runs slightly ahead of Sac7d, consistent with

a molecular weight of 7150 (calculated from the sequence). Sch~igger-von Jagow gels do not resolve the individual native Sac7 and Sso7 species. The identity of the proteins can be confirmed by amino terminal sequencing, mass spectroscopy, and the various properties described below. Sac7d and Sso7d have been shown to be monomeric in solution by small angle X-ray scattering. Data were measured using a 2-D phase-sensitive detector over a Q range of 0.01 to 0.22 A -l. The net scattering of the protein was determined by subtracting a normalized buffer spectrum measured in the same quartz capillary. Protein concentrations ranged from 5 to 20 mg/ml, and the data were extrapolated to zero concentration. The solution scattering data indicate that both Sac7d and Sso7d are globular in 0.01 M K2HPO4 (pH 7) with, or without, 0.3 M KCI. A mass of 7460 Da was obtained for Sac7d from the intensity at zero scattering angle, and a radius of gyration (Rg) of 12.4/~ was determined by Guinier analysis 31 of the scattering data. The Rg for Sso7d is slightly smaller (11.6/~), as expected from the differences in the amino acid sequences. Both Rg values are large and indicate significant hydration of these highly basic proteins.

UV Absorbance
The UV extinction coefficient of both the native and recombinant Sac7d is 1.09 ± 0.04 ml/(mg, cm) at the wavelength of maximal absorption (278 nm). 5 The extinction coefficient for Sso7d is calculated to be 1.17 ml/mg, cm based on the difference in molecular weights. Use of the extinction coefficients to measure protein concentration requires an accurately calibrated spectrophotometer. The wavelength of the central most intense line of benzene vapor should be 252.88 nm. Absorbance accuracy is determined using 0.0400 gm/liter potassium chromate in 0.05 M KOH, 32 which should have an absorbance of 0.757 at 275 nm with a 1 cm cell at 25 ° .

Fluorescence
The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of Sac7 and Sso7 (5 IxM protein in 10 mM KH2PO4, pH 6.8) are obtained with excitation at 295 nm using 4 nm excitation and emission slit widths. Excitation at 295 nm prevents contributions from the two tyrosine and two phenylalanine residues. An emission maximum at 350 nm is similar to that of free tryptophan and indicates significant solvent exposure, consistent with the NMR solution structure. Addition of double-stranded DNA [e.g., duplex poly[d(GC)]] leads to quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by nearly 90%. A blue shift of the emission maximum to 340 nm is also observed,

indicating decreased solvent exposure of the tryptophan. This behavior is consistent with the X-ray crystal structure of a Sac7d-octanucleotide complex that shows the tryptophan at the DNA-protein interface (Fig. 3).
Circular Dichroism

CD spectra of Sac7d and Sso7d are measured in the far-UV spectral region (below 260 nm) with sample concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 mg/ml using cells of 1.0 to 0.01 cm path length, respectively. Shorter path lengths (and higher concentrations) permit CD measurements at shorter wavelengths, with 1 mm cuvettes working well for far-UV CD spectra. The choice of solvent can limit accessibility to the far-UV, and dilute simple buffers (e.g., 10 mM Na2HPO4) are the most transparent. The CD of the proteins in the near-UV (320-250 nm) is about 1% of that of the far-UV and is measured at concentrations of 1 mg/ml in a 1-cm path length cuvette. Spectra are collected at 1 nm intervals using averaging times of 8 to 15 s/nm, depending on the signal intensity, with a spectral bandwidth of 1.5 nm. The spectra are smoothed with a sliding 9- or 11-point convoluting quadratic function, as described by Savitsky and Golay. 33 Baselines are measured using water and subtracted from the sample spectrum. The molar CD per peptide bond (A~ = ~L - ~R) is calculated using the UV extinction coefficient. The CD instrument is calibrated at 290.5 nm with d-camphor-10-sulfonic acid using Ae °'1~ = 2.36 and a ratio AE192.5/AE290.5of --2.0534. Sample temperature is regulated with a computer-controlled thermoelectric cuvette holder to within -t-0.2 ° over a range of 10 to 80 °. At 95 ° the error in the sample temperature is about 4-0.5 °. No differences are detected in the far-UV or near-UV CD spectra of recombinant and native Sac7d. However, the CD of Sso7d differs significantly from that of Sac7d (Fig. 4), presumably because of a truncated and more disordered C-terminal helix. The near-UV CD of protein is an induced optical activity of the aromatic side chains due to the asymmetric environment of the folded protein. Therefore, the near-UV CD is often used as an indicator of the protein tertiary structure. The far-UV CD is dominated by contributions from the peptide bond and, thus, is a measure of the protein secondary structure.
Stability

Both guanidine hydrochloride and urea promote unfolding of Sac7d, with guanidine hydrochloride much more effective than urea. Protocols for measuring free energies of unfolding by chemical denaturation have been described by Pace.35 33 A. Savitskyand M. J. E. Golay,Anal Chem. 36, 1627 (1964). 34 G. C. Chen and J. T. Yang,Anal Lett. 10, 1195 (1977). 35 C. N. Pace, Methods Enzymol. 131,266 (1986).

At pH 7 and 20 °, increasing guanidine hydrochloride leads to a characteristic sigmoidal change in CD with a midpoint concentration of 2.8 M denaturant. Linear extrapolation of the data to zero denaturant gives a free energy of unfolding of 5.3 (4-0.3) kcal/mol and an m value of 1896 (+97) cal tool -1M -1.15 Urea concentrations as high as 8 M cannot unfold Sac7d at pH 7. However, reversible unfolding is observed in urea at pH 4 with a midpoint at 5.3 M denaturant giving a free energy of unfolding of 3.4 (+0.3) kcal/mol and an m value of 633 (4-64) cal m o l - l M -1 at this pH. Thermal unfolding of Sac7d leads to significant changes in both the near- and far-UV CD spectra. The thermally unfolded protein has a CD spectrum similar to that observed in the presence of denaturing guanidine hydrochlofide or urea at high temperature.15 Thermal unfolding is performed under computer control in 1° increments at 205 nm, a wavelength that provides a strong CD signal in both the folded and unfolded states and displays a cooperative melting profile. After temperature equilibration, the CD signal is averaged for 20 sec before proceeding to the next temperature increment. The baseline for the melt is independent of temperature and is derived from the smoothed CD spectrum of water at 20 °. Thermal melts of Sac7d monitored by CD at 205 nm, CDobs, can be converted into fraction folded,f, f -CDobs --

Thermally unfolded protein also regains full D N A binding activity on refolding (see below). The thermal stability o f Sso7d is greater than that o f Sac7d, as might be expected from the higher growth temperature of S. solfataricus compared to S. acidocaldarius.

Lysine Monomethylation
The e-amino groups of a few specific lysines in native Sac7 and Sso7 are monomethylated. 6,7 The extent of monomethylation at each of the sites is not complete, but has been shown to increase with heat shock in Sso7d. 19 Lysine-4 and lysine-6 are monomethylated in both Sac7 and Sso7 (Fig. 1). In addition, Cterminal lysines are monomethylated in Sso7d (and also Sac7e). The Tm of native Sac7d and Sso7d is greater than that o f the recombinant forms by about 7 +. This may be due to the monomethylation of the native forms, but definitive evidence for this has not been provided. 36 j. W. Shriver, W. B. Peters, N. Szary, A. T. Clark, and S.

Alternatively, structural transitions in DNA can be monitored by CD. Sac7 and Sso7 induce an unwinding and kink in duplex DNA 22 that leads to a large change in near-UV CD bands of DNA.16 ITC is especially useful for binding studies at physiological growth temperatures of Sulfolobus. 36

DNA Binding Followed by Fluorescence
Fluorescence DNA binding titrations are performed in the "reverse" mode by adding 5.0 txl aliquots of a 1.0 mM DNA stock to 3.0 ml of 5 p~M protein in a 4 ml fluorescence quartz cell (Fig. 6). A carefully calibrated Unimetrics syringe with a utility stop permits reproducible, repetitive deliveries of a constant volume. The solution is mixed by constant stirring using a magnetic "flea" at the bottom of the cell. Nucleic acid and protein stock concentrations are determined by UV

absorption. Titrations are performed at constant temperature using a temperaturecontrolled cell holder. The fluorescence intensity reaches a plateau at saturating DNA concentrations, indicating that no correction is needed for an inner filter effect. Any decrease in fluorescence due to the inner filter effect is apparently balanced by scattering of the DNA-protein complexes.

DNA Binding Affinity and Site Size
DNA binding constants and site sizes are obtained from fluorescence titration data by nonlinear regression. 16 The observed intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence q u e n c h i n g , Qobs, is defined by Qob~ = (Fi -- Fobs)/Fi (2)

where Fi and Fobs are the fluorescence intensity of the protein in the absence and presence of DNA, respectively. It is generally assumed that the fractional change in fluorescence quenching is equal to the fraction of protein bound, giving
Lb = (Qobs/Qmax)Lt

(3)

where Lb is the bound protein concentration, Lt is the total protein concentration, and Qmax is the maximal observed quenching at saturating DNA concentrations. This relation must be true if meaningful parameters (binding constant, site size, cooperativity) are to be extracted from binding isotherms.5' 16,37It has been shown that this relation is valid for Sac7d binding to DNA by using the model-independent ligand-binding density function analysis method of Bujalowski and Lohman.38 From Eq. (2), the free protein concentration is given by
Z f .~- t t - Z b = t t ( Oobs ~ Ct \ Omax.]

Noncooperative binding of protein nonspecifically to an infinite lattice is described by the McGhee-von Hippel model 39 where
Lf :

K is the binding affinity, n is the binding site size (in nucleotide bases), and v is the binding density given by
v = Lb/Dt

Dt is the total DNA concentration. Equation (5) cannot be arranged to give Lf (and therefore Qobs) as a function of Lt and Dr, so Qob~must be obtained using numerical methods for given values of n, K, Qmax.We have found that the Loehle adaptive

grid refinement Global Optimization routine (Loehle Enterprises, Naperville, IL) is especially robust for finding solutions to the McGhee-von Hippel equation. Nonlinear regression with this routine is used to obtain values for n, K, andQmax given a data set of Qobs values for a series of Lt and Dt concentrations. Errors in the binding parameters derived from nonlinear regression are obtained using the Monte Carlo method for confidence interval estimation. 4°-42 Random data sets (e.g., 50) are generated using a Gaussian random number generator 43 with the mean equal to the "true" Qobs obtained from the optimized values for the parameters, and the standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the fit. The distribution of the binding parameters determined from fitting the simulated data sets provides the confidence limits. In general, the Monte Carlo errors are much less than the experimental errors, i.e., 4-10, -4-5, and -4-0.3% for K, n, andQobs. The DNA-binding parameters for native and recombinant Sac7d are identical within experimental error. 5'16 The dissociation constant for duplex poly[d(GC)] is 9.3 x 10-TM in 10 mMKHzPO4 (pH 6.8) and 50 mM KC1 at 25 °. Doublestranded poly[d(AT)] binds slightly more weakly with a dissociation constant of 5 x 10-6M under the same conditions. Most other DNA sequences, including natural random sequence DNAs, are intermediate with dissociation constants of about 1.5 x 10-6M in 50 mM KC1. The binding affinity is salt dependent and decreases by about two orders of magnitude upon increasing the salt from 10 mM to 100 raM. 16 Native and recombinant Sso7d bind about 2-3-fold weaker than Sac7d (Shriver, 1999, unpublished data). The binding site sizes of Sac7d and Sso7d are rather small at about four base pairs per protein. There is no evidence of cooperativity in DNA binding from the fluorescence titration data.

Cooperative Structural Transitions Induced in DNA
Forward titrations of protein into DNA can be followed by CD since the spectrum of protein-DNA mixtures is dominated by contributions from the DNA at wavelengths greater than 250 nm (Fig. 7). Spectra are measured at 20 ° from 200 to 320 nm in 1-cm path length cuvettes starting with an initial DNA solution with an absorbance at 260 nm of 0.5 in 0.01 M KzHPO4 (pH 7). Aliquots of a concentrated protein solution are added gravimetrically, and the spectra are scaled by the AE of the DNA. As expected, there is an increase in the negative short wavelength CD band at 220 nm due to increasing contributions of protein. However, the increase in the positive CD band at 285 nm is much greater than expected from

The long wavelength CD band o f duplex D N A is known to be very sensitive to D N A conformation, 44,45 and the CD changes measured upon binding Sac7d probably reflect unwinding and kinking of the D N A as observed in the X-ray crystal structure (Fig. 3). The change in the near-UV CD as a function of the fraction of the D N A complexed with protein is sigmoidal (Fig. 8), indicating a cooperative conformational change in the DNA, even though SacTd binding is noncooperative· Such behavior is a unique feature of S a c 7 d - D N A interactions and has not been observed in any other DNA-binding protein.

Sac7d molecules must be bound within 8 base pairs (Gm ~- 8) to affect the structure of poly[d(AG)] · poly[d(CT)], while they must be immediately adjacent on poly[d(IC)] · poly[d(IC)] (G,, = 0). The susceptibility of different DNAs to the protein-induced conformational change reflects sequence dependent conformational preferences of DNA.
Stabilization of DNA Duplex

Thermal denaturation studies of DNA and DNA-protein complexes are performed on a UV spectrophotometer equipped with temperature controlled cell holders. Melting of the DNA duplex is indicated by a cooperative hyperchromism at 260 nm. Stabilization by Sac7d is most readily observed with poly[d(AT)]. poly[d(AT)] because of its intrinsic low stability, especially in low salt. The UV melting curve of poly[d(AT)] · poly[d(AT)] in 0.01 M K2HPO4 is sharp with a Tm of 43.5 ° (Fig. 9). In the presence of Sac7d, the melting profile of poly[d(AT)]. poly[d(AT)] broadens and the Tm increases by as much as 33°C for solutions with an excess of Sac7d. The observed Tm for the complex depends on the concentration of protein. R N a s e Activity A s s a y Fusi et al. 11"12 and Kulms et al. 25 have shown that the RNase activity associated with P2 (Sso7d) and SaRD (Sac7d) can be measured by two methods: either

hydrolysis of yeast RNA measured by release of acid-soluble RNA fragments, or hydrolysis of tRNA or rRNA monitored by gel electrophoresis. We describe the former since the measurement of a specific activity permits a quantitative analysis. The method is derived from that of Anfinsen 46 and is based on measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm that remains following acid precipitation of polymeric RNA and protein. The measured activity is extremely low, and the background level of soluble RNA is typically high because of soluble ribonucleotides in commercial RNA samples, spontaneous hydrolysis of substrate at 60 °, and contaminating RNases. Purified Sac7 and Sso7 are chromatographed on Sephacryl S- 100-HR (30 cm x 2.5 cm) in 0.02 M Tris (pH 7.4) to distinguish low levels of activity from the background. Column fractions are collected in glass tubes that have been heated to over 140 ° for 12 hr to eliminate contaminating RNase. Activities of column fractions are assayed quantitatively using essentially the procedure described by Fusi et al. 11 and Kulms et al., 25 except for addition of a disulfide reducing agent. Neither Sac7 nor Sso7 contain cysteine, and therefore any activity due to these proteins should be unaffected by reducing agents. 2-Mercaptoethanol is chosen since dithiothreitol (DTT) and dithioerythritol (DTE) interfere with the absorbance measurement at 260 nm for RNA. Aliquots (200 Ixl) of each column fraction are preincubated at 60 ° in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes for 5 min in 0.02 M Tris (pH 7.4), with or without 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol. RNA (140 Ixg of yeast RNA, Sigma, Type III) is added and the sample incubated at 60 ° for 30 min. The reaction is quenched with an equal volume of 1.2 M perchloric acid with 22 mM

lanthanum nitrate and left on ice for 30 min. Acid-induced precipitate is removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 ° . A portion of the supernatant (200 Ixl) is diluted with 1.0 ml deionized water and the absorbance at 260 nm measured. A unit of activity produces an increase of 1.0 absorbance unit per minute. Sso7d elutes from the Sephacryl column with a molecular weight consistent with a monomer. The RNase activity elutes slightly before the major protein peak. The specific activity associated with the peak is on the order of 1 to 10 units/mg Sso7d. The activity is low (namely, the activity of bovine RNase A is on the order of 5000 units/mg) and is largely eliminated with mercaptoethanol. The level of apparent activity remaining (0.15 + 0.15 units/mg) is identical to that observed in the absence of RNA (0.15 4- 0.4 units/mg) and is attributed to the presence of acid soluble protein in the assay that contributes to the absorbance at 260 nm (i.e., the perchloric acid does not precipitate Sac7 and Sso7). All activities are reported relative to the background "activity" measured before and after the protein peak (i.e., in the absence of protein). These observations have been confirmed with recombinant Sso7d, and similar results are obtained with native and recombinant Sac7d. The ability to largely eliminate the RNase activity associated with these proteins is consistent with a report that RNase A is a contaminant in Sso7d preparations. 47 The apparent activity that remains is due to the acid solubility of the proteins, which is expected given that acid solubility is used as an initial step in purifying these proteins. Concluding Remarks Sac7d and Sso7d are small monomeric chromatin proteins that bind nonspecifically to DNA with moderate affinity and stabilize the double helix. Binding occurs at a site of four base pairs and is associated with significant unwinding and bending of DNA due to intercalation of a methionine and valine. Although binding is noncooperative, the distortions induced in DNA require cooperative interactions between adjacent protein monomers. Acknowledgment
