Abstract The enzyme 3-deoxy-D -arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) catalyzes the condensation reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P). DAH7PS from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein was insoluble but was partially solubilized as a dimer by the inclusion of 200 mM KCl in the cell lysis buffer. An effective two step purification procedure has been developed. The first step resulted in a high degree of purification and involved lysis by sonication at approximately 40 °C followed by a heat treatment at 70 °C. A continuous assay measuring the loss of PEP at 232 nm at elevated temperatures was also developed. Temperature, pH, and divalent metal ions all had an effect on the extinction coefficient of PEP. Purified recombinant P. furiosus DAH7PS is a dimer with a subunit Mr of 29,226 (determined by ESMS), shows resistance to denaturation by SDS, has activity over a broad pH range, and has an activation energy of 88 kJ molÀ1 . The kinetic parameters are Km (PEP) 120 lM, Km (E4P) 28 lM, and kcat 1.5 sÀ1 , at 60 °C and pH 6.8. DAH7PS is not inhibited by phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. EDTA inactivates the enzyme and enzyme activity is restored by a wide range of divalent metal ions including (in order of decreasing effectiveness): Zn2þ , Cd2þ , Mn2þ , Co2þ , Ni2þ , Ca2þ , Hg2þ , and Cu2þ . This detailed characterization of the DAH7PS from P. furiosus raises the possibility that the subfamily Ib DAH7PS enzymes are metal ion dependent, contrary to previous predictions.

The enzyme 3-deoxy-D -arabino-heptulosonate 7phosphate synthase (DAH7PS1, EC 2.5.1.54) catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) to form 3-deoxy-D -arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P). This reaction is the first step in the shikimate pathway used to

synthesize chorismate, the precursor of aromatic amino acids and many aromatic secondary metabolites [1]. The shikimate pathway is found in plants and microorganisms, but not animals [2] and is an attractive target for the development of herbicides and antimicrobial agents.

DAH7PS proteins can be divided into two distinct families by amino acid sequence homology [3]. Family II DAH7PS proteins have previously been described as enzymes from plant sources [1] but are now known to be a diverse set of microbial proteins that include a subcluster of plant proteins [4]. Family I DAH7PS enzymes are also microbial proteins, with the exception of two plant proteins, and can be further divided into two subfamilies [5]. Subfamily Ia consists entirely of DAH7PS proteins, whereas subfamily Ib divides into DAH7PS proteins (class IbD ) and KDO8PS proteins (class IbK ) which catalyze the closely related 3-deoxy-D manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) reaction [5]. Although members of class IbD are functionally equivalent to members of subfamily Ia in that they catalyze the condensation of E4P and PEP, they show greater overall sequence similarity to members of class IbK [5]. It has been proposed that family I proteins be renamed the 3-deoxyald-2-ulosonate-phosphate synthase family, to accommodate the different substrate specificities of the member subfamilies [6]. Family II DAH7PS proteins are generally larger than subfamily Ia DAH7PS proteins, which are in turn generally larger than subfamily Ib proteins (approximately 54,000 Mr , 39,000 Mr , and 30,000 Mr , respectively) [3,5]. The characterized members of subfamily Ia DAH7PS are metalloenzymes as exemplified by the Escherichia coli DAH7PS paralogues. Class IbD proteins have been considered to be nonmetalloenzymes, based on evidence from Bacillus subtilis DAH7PS [5­8 and references therein]. Class IbK contains both metalloenzymes and nonmetalloenzymes, the most well characterized being Aquifex aeolicus KDO8PS [9,10] and E. coli KDO8PS [11], respectively. KDO8PS (EC 2.5.1.55) catalyzes the condensation of PEP and arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) to form 3-deoxy-D -manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P). This reaction is a key step in the synthesis of 3-deoxy-D -manno-octulosonate (KDO) required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Gram negative bacteria [11]. Although KDO8PS and DAH7PS belong to apparently functionally unrelated pathways and often show low sequence identity (especially between subfamily Ia DAH7PS enzymes and class IbK KDO8PS enzymes) [5], both enzymes catalyze the condensation of PEP with an aldose by a similar mechanism [7]. Additionally, X-ray crystal structures of subfamily Ia DAH7PS (E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DAH7PS) are remarkably similar to KDO8PS from class IbK (A. aeolicus and E. coli KDO8PS) [12­15]. Despite low sequence identity, many of the active site residues are conserved between DAH7PS and KDO8PS, and essential residues occur in the same order. Pyrococcus furiosus DAH7PS, which is the subject of this study, belongs to class IbD . Pyrococcus furiosus is a hyperthermophile, found in deep-sea hydrothermal vents and having an optimum

growth temperature of 100 °C [16]. Enzymes tolerant of high temperature can often be easily purified by a simple heat treatment after expression in a mesophile such as E. coli, and contaminating activities from the expressing organism are usually removed [17­19]. Expressed protein may not always be soluble, but there are a number of methods for improving solubility, including different vector/host combinations, reduction of the cultivation temperature, various cell lysis methods and conditions (including the use of detergents or salt during lysis), and unfolding and refolding protocols. A variety of methods are available to assay DAH7PS activity. Many continuous assays measure the production of DAH7P using coupled enzyme assays, however the loss of PEP can be directly measured spectrophotometrically [20]. Discontinuous assays available for measuring levels of DAH7P include the Aminoff (periodate­thiobarbituric acid) method [21] and the Lanzetta phosphate assay [22]. While discontinuous assays can be used for activity measurements at elevated temperatures, coupled enzyme continuous assays currently cannot be used at elevated temperatures. The measurement of the loss of PEP is the only practical continuous assay of DAH7PS activity at elevated temperatures. This paper describes the expression, purification, and the biochemical characterization of the recombinant DAH7PS from P. furiosus, and the development of a continuous assay for use at elevated temperatures.

Methods Bacteria, plasmids, and strains The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame (ORF) annotated as coding for P. furiosus (DSM (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen) 3638) DAH7PS (GenBank Accession No. NP579419, gi:18978062) was retrieved, with flanking nucleotide sequences, from GenBank Accession No. NC003413 (gi:18976372). Oligonucleotide F1 (50 -CCAAGGCTG CGTATGCCATTGGA-30 ) was constructed to eliminate an internal NdeI restriction site (CATATG becomes CGTATG, underlined) and oligonucleotide B (50 -GAT CTCCAAAGCTT ATCCCTTCCAT-30 ) was constructed to introduce a HindIII site (underlined) overlapping the TAA stop codon (TTA in italics). Standard PCR methodologies using P. furiosus DSM 3638 purified genomic DNA as template with primers F1 and B, and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), were employed to amplify a 164 bp region of template DNA corresponding to the 30 end of the P. furiosus DAH7PS ORF. The PCR product was purified directly (Nucleospin Extract Kit, Macherey-Nagel) and used as a ÔmegaprimerÕ in conjunction with oligonucleotide F2 (50 ATTTGAGACATATGAAATATTCAAAAGAATA-30 )

in a second PCR to introduce a NdeI site (underlined, incorporating the ATG start codon) and to change the third base in codons two (AAG ! AAA) and three (TAC ! TAT) of the DAH7PS ORF. The amplified product (812 bp) was purified from a 1% agarose gel (Nucleospin Extract Kit), digested with NdeI and HindIII, ethanol precipitated, and ligated into pT7-7 [23] previously restricted with the same endonucleases. The ligation reaction was used to transform competent E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene). Plasmid minipreps from three transformants were identified as recombinant plasmids by restriction with NdeI and HindIII followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. One putative pT7-PfuDAH7PS plasmid was sequenced on both strands to confirm the expected DNA sequence and used to transform competent E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). Transformants of this strain were routinely grown in Luria broth (Gibco) containing 0.33% (w/v) glucose (Sigma) and 100 lg mlÀ1 ampicillin (Sigma). Assay development and assays The assay of Schoner and Herrmann [20] was used and modified. The consumption of PEP was monitored at 232 nm (extinction coefficient at 232 nm of 2.8 Â 103 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 25 °C and pH 6.8) using a Varian Cary 1 UV­Vis spectrophotometer. Measurements were made using 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes maintained at the required temperature in a thermostatted cuvette holder. Initial rates of reaction were determined by a least squares fit of the initial rate data. One unit of activity is defined as the loss of 1 lmol of PEP per minute at the stated temperature. Activities at temperatures other than 25 °C were calculated using the extinction coefficients determined as below. PEP (Research Chemicals) and E4P (Sigma) solutions were prepared by dissolving a weighed amount of each material in a measured volume of 50 mM of 1,3bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino)propane (BTP) (Sigma) buffer. The temperature at which the pH of the buffer was adjusted is denoted by a subscript. In concentrated solutions, E4P exists in a dimeric form, which converts slowly to the monomeric species on dilution [24]. Thus, E4P solutions were left for a minimum of 1 h before use in order for the dimer to convert to monomer. Accurate concentrations of PEP and E4P were determined by following the loss of PEP on complete conversion of one of the substrates (with the other in excess) using an E. coli DAH7PS preparation. Accurate concentrations of PEP were also determined by a coupled assay system by observing the oxidation of NADH (extinction coefficient at 340 nm of 6.2 Â 103 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 25 °C) by lactate dehydrogenase following the conversion of PEP to pyruvate via pyruvate kinase. Assays contained ADP (4 mM) (US Biochemical), KCl (5 mM) (Ajax Chemicals), MgCl2 (5 mM) (BDH), NADH

(0.125 mM) (Biomol), and PEP (approximately 40 lM), and lactate dehydrogenase (approximately 25 U) (Sigma) in 10 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.825 °C . Assays were initiated with pyruvate kinase (approximately 1.5 U) (Sigma) and performed at 25 °C in a total volume of 1 ml. Metal ions were removed from buffer and reagent solutions by treatment with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad). Solutions were filtered through a 0.45 lm membrane prior to use. DAH7PS solutions contained 200 lM PEP to stabilize the enzyme and 10 lM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Sigma) to sequester residual metal ions. The standard assay reaction mixture contained E4P (350 lM), PEP (80 lM), and MnSO4 (100 lM) (Sigma) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.860 °C and was preincubated at 60 °C for 7­10 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.5­6 ll (0.011­0.043 U) of enzyme, unless otherwise stated. The total volume was 1 ml. The extinction coefficient of PEP at various temperatures was determined by following the complete conversion of PEP (with E4P in excess). The reaction mixture contained PEP (160 lM) and MnSO4 (100 lM) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.8 at the required temperature. The reaction mixture was preincubated at the required temperature for 10 min, E4P was added (660 lM), and then 1 min later the assay was initiated by the addition of either 2.5 ll (0.094 U) of an E. coli DAH7PS preparation at 25 °C or 2.5 ll (0.018 U) of the purified P. furiosus DAH7PS at elevated temperatures. A correction for the change in absorbance due to addition of the enzyme was determined using reaction mixtures with E4P absent. The extinction coefficient of PEP at various pH values was determined similarly in 50 mM BTP buffer at the required pH value at 60 °C, initiated by the addition of 2.5 ll (0.018 U) of the purified P. furiosus DAH7PS. The extinction coefficient of PEP at increased divalent metal ion concentrations was also determined similarly. The stability of E4P under assay conditions was determined by inserting cuvettes containing the reaction mixture at room temperature into the heating block of the spectrophotometer set at 60 °C, at t ¼ 0. The reaction mixture contained E4P (64 lM), PEP (340 lM), and MnSO4 (100 lM) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.860 °C . At appropriate time intervals, a cuvette was removed and rapidly cooled on ice for 5 min. After warming to room temperature, the amount of remaining substrate was determined at 25 °C by the addition of 2 ll (0.075 U) of an E. coli DAH7PS preparation. The stability of PEP was determined similarly. The reaction mixtures contained E4P (320 lM), PEP (85 lM), and MnSO4 (100 lM) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.860 °C . Solutions of L -phenylalanine (Sigma), L -tyrosine (Sigma) or L -tryptophan (Sigma) dissolved in water were added to standard assay reaction mixtures to a final concentration of 250 lM in inhibitor studies.

Assays for the determination of kinetic parameters involved preincubation of the enzyme with PEP and MnSO4 , followed by initiation with E4P, to prevent a marked decrease in E4P concentration due to instability over time at 60 °C. To determine kinetics for PEP, the reaction mixture contained PEP (20­590 lM), MnSO4 (100 lM), and the purified P. furiosus DAH7PS (2.5 ll, 0.018 U) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.860 °C . The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mM (20 ll) E4P. To determine kinetics for E4P, the reaction mixture contained PEP (200 lM), MnSO4 (100 lM), and the purified P. furiosus DAH7PS (2.5 ll, 0.018 U) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.860 °C . The reaction was initiated by the addition of 15­240 lM (1­16 ll) E4P. Kinetics experiments were performed in duplicate. Km and kcat values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis­Menten equation using Enzfitter (Biosoft). Assays to determine the effect of temperature on activity contained 50 mM BTP buffer adjusted to pH 6.8 at the temperature of use. Reaction mixtures contained PEP (80 lM) and MnSO4 (100 lM) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.8 at the required temperature. The reaction mixture was preincubated at the required temperature for 7­10 min, E4P was added (220 lM), and then 1 min later the assay was initiated by the addition of 6 ll (0.043 U) enzyme. The total volume was 1 ml. Specific activities at 25, 60, 70, and 80 °C were calculated using the extinction coefficients for PEP determined at each temperature. Specific activities at 30, 40, and 50 °C were calculated using predicted extinction coefficients of 2.8, 2.8, and 2.7 Â 103 MÀ1 cmÀ1 , respectively. Divalent metal salts used in assays to restore activity to the EDTA-treated enzyme were dissolved in 50 mM BTP buffer containing 10 lM EDTA at pH 6.860 °C , which had been pretreated with Chelex. Reaction mixtures were pretreated with 100 lM EDTA for 5 min and the enzyme preparation was also treated with 100 lM EDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 8 ll (0.056 U) enzyme. All metal concentrations reported have been corrected for the presence of EDTA. The metal salts used were; MnSO4 , ZnSO4 (BDH), CdSO4 (BDH), CoSO4 (May and Baker), NiCl2 (May and Baker), CaCl2 (Prolabo), Hg(NO3 )2 Á HgO (May and Baker), CuSO4 (May and Baker), FeCl2 (Riedel-de Han), e MgSO4 (May and Baker), SrCl2 (Unilab), and BaCl2 (BDH). Purification BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL/pT7-PfuDAH7PS was grown in 250 ml Luria broth supplemented with 0.33% (w/v) glucose and 100 lg mlÀ1 ampicillin, in a 1 L conical flask with vigorous shaking at 40 °C. Isopropyl-b-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Applichem) was added at 1 mM to mid-logarithmic phase cultures (OD600 nm $ 0.4) to induce expression. Cells were har-

vested by centrifugation (17,300g, 20 min, 4 °C) 3 h after IPTG induction (OD600 nm $ 1.7). Cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at )20 °C. Cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 7 ml of 50 mM BTP containing 200 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (BDH), and 200 lM PEP at pH 7.225 °C . One hundred and forty microlitres Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (140 ll) (Roche) was added. Cells were ruptured by sonication at approximately 60 W for 8 Â 30 s pulses (with 1 min delay between pulses) at $40 °C using a water bath, with a Virsonic Digital 475 cell disrupter equipped with 1/8 in. probe. Approximately 1 mg of bovine pancreas DNase (BDH) was added and the lysate was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The lysate was heat treated in covered Corex tubes, in a heating block at 70 °C for 30 min, and then cooled on the bench at room temperature. The heat treated lysate was centrifuged (17,300g, 20 min, 15 °C) and the supernatant was frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at )70 °C. Gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham) was performed at 4 °C using a BioLogic Duo-Flow FPLC system (BioRad) with detection at 280 and 214 nm. The running buffer was 10 mM BTP containing 40 mM KCl, 10 lM EDTA, and 200 lM PEP at pH 7.025 °C and had been Chelex treated and filtered. A flow rate of 0.2 or 0.25 ml minÀ1 was used. Filtered samples of the heat treated supernatant (300 ll) were applied to the column using a 500 ll loop. Some samples were treated with streptomycin sulfate (final concentration 1% (w/v)) (Sigma) for a few minutes at 4 °C and then centrifuged to remove DNA before filtering. Fractions containing protein and exhibiting DAH7PS activity were pooled and concentrated using a prewashed 20 ml Vivaspin 10000 MWCO concentrator (Vivascience). The concentrate was frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at )70 °C. The frozen enzyme was stable for at least eight months. The expression and purification of E. coli DAH7PS(phe) followed the procedure of Parker [25]. The preparation of E. coli DAH7PS(phe) had a specific activity of 24.2 U mgÀ1 . Molecular weight determination The molecular weight of DAH7PS was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Micromass ZMD instrument, equipped with an electrospray ionization source controlled by Micromass MassLynx software, calibrated with myoglobin (Sigma). Raw spectra were deconvoluted using MaxEnt1. The protein sample was exchanged into 4 mM ammonium bicarbonate using a prewashed 0.5 ml Vivaspin 10000 MWCO concentrator before mixing with an equal volume of acetonitrile acidified with 2% (v/v) formic acid, prior to mass spectrometry.

The native molecular weight was determined by gel filtration chromatography as above. A standard curve was generated using lysozyme (14.3 kDa, Sigma), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36 kDa, Sigma), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, Gibco), and alcohol dehydrogenase (141 kDa, Sigma). Filtered samples of the heat treated supernatant (300 ll) at concentrations of 0.5 mg mlÀ1 were applied to the column using a 500 ll loop. The void volume of the column was determined using Blue Dextran 2000 (Sigma). The molecular weight was estimated from a standard curve prepared by plotting Ve =V0 versus the log of the molecular weight of the standards. Thermostability Aliquots of purified P. furiosus DAH7PS (24 ll, 0.95 mg mlÀ1 ) in 30 mM BTP containing 25 mM KCl, 5 lM EDTA, and 100 lM PEP at pH 7.095 °C in the presence and absence of 100 lM MnSO4 were incubated at 95 °C in thin-walled 0.2 ml PCR tubes in a Biometra TGradient apparatus (Whatman). Tubes containing MnSO4 were preincubated at 65 °C for 1 min immediately before incubation at 95 °C. At various intervals, tubes were removed and cooled on ice. After mixing, 18 ll was subjected to the standard assay at 60 °C and the remainder was analysed by SDS­PAGE. Miscellaneous methods Electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was performed by the method of Laemmli [26] with a 4% (w/v) stacking gel and a 12% (w/v) running gel, using a Mini Protean III cell (Bio-Rad). Samples were prepared in a loading buffer containing SDS, not boiled before application unless otherwise stated, and loaded within 10 min. Low range SDS­PAGE molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) were used. Native PAGE was performed similarly, with a 4% (w/v) stacking gel and a 15% (w/v) running gel and with the omission of SDS from all buffers. After electrophoresis, gels were stained for protein using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 (Park Scientific) or silver staining [27]. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford [28], using bovine serum albumin as a standard.

sure initial rates. This assay has previously been performed at 25 °C. As the P. furiosus optimum growth temperature is 100 °C, activity assays of P. furiosus enzymes should ideally be done close to this temperature. However, high temperatures render continuous assays more difficult due to both equipment constraints and assay component effects. An assay for P. furiosus DAH7PS was developed for use at elevated temperatures by assessing individual concerns. Initially, the pH of BTP buffers was adjusted at the temperature of use to allow for DpKa /°C ()0.016, [29]). Then the extinction coefficient of PEP was examined, as many metabolites or cofactors have temperature dependent extinction coefficients [30]. The extinction coefficient of PEP was found to be temperature dependent under assay conditions (Fig. 1). The extinction coefficient decreased markedly above 70 °C. At higher temperatures, sensitivity and accuracy were quickly lost and the assay became unreliable. The extinction coefficient of PEP was examined further at 60 °C and appeared to be pH dependent under assay conditions (data not shown). This effect has been shown in detail by Wold and Ballou [31], who also reported the effect of magnesium ion concentration on the extinction coefficient of PEP. The extinction coefficient also appeared to be dependent on the concentration of manganese ions in this study. The extinction coefficient of PEP was 2.6 Â 103 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 0.1 mM Mn2þ and 1.9 Â 103 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 0.9 mM Mn2þ . The type of divalent metal ion may have had some effect on the extinction coefficient (data not shown). Next, the stability of the substrates at 60 °C was examined. E4P is known to be unstable in solution [25],

Results and discussion Assay development A continuous assay measuring the loss of PEP at 232 nm (extinction coefficient of 2.8 Â 103 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 25 °C at pH 6.8) was used. The advantage of continuous assays over discontinuous assays is the ability to meaFig. 1. Effect of temperature on the extinction coefficient of PEP under assay conditions. The extinction coefficient was determined by following the complete conversion of PEP (with E4P in excess) at 232 nm. The reaction mixture contained PEP (160 lM) and MnSO4 (100 lM) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.8 at the required temperature. Assays were initiated with purified P. furiosus DAH7PS (2.5 ll, 0.018 U) at elevated temperatures, or E. coli DAH7PS (2.5 ll, 0.094 U) at 25 °C, 1 min after the addition of E4P (660 lM).

with E4P addition immediately prior to enzyme initiation, to allow for E4P instability. Reaction mixtures were usually equilibrated at 60 °C for 7­10 min prior to initiation, with initial rates measured within the next minute. The modified assay has a known extinction coefficient, constant pH, and constant manganese ion concentration, and makes allowances for E4P instability. This assay can be undertaken at 70 °C with careful allowance for the instability of E4P. An extinction coefficient of 2.6 Â 103 MÀ1 cmÀ1 was used in all calculations of activities at 60 °C. The rate of activity was shown to be proportional to the amount of P. furiosus DAH7PS used (R2 ¼ 0:992), up to 9 ll (0.065 U) of enzyme per 1 ml assay (data not shown).
Fig. 2. Stability of E4P and PEP at 60 °C under assay conditions. E4P or PEP was incubated at 60 °C under assay conditions. E4P stability mixtures contained E4P (64 lM), PEP (340 lM), and MnSO4 (100 lM) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.860 °C . PEP stability mixtures contained E4P (320 lM), PEP (85 lM), and MnSO4 (100 lM) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.860 °C . At various intervals, cuvettes were removed and cooled on ice. The amount of substrate remaining was immediately determined at 25 °C by the addition of E. coli DAH7PS.

PAGE analysis Dimer could be detected by SDS­PAGE by not boiling the samples in SDS-loading buffer. Boiling the samples resulted in complete disruption of the dimer, so that only one band, corresponding to the monomer, could be seen by SDS- or native PAGE (Fig. 3, lanes A3 and B2). SDS in the loading buffer caused a slow, time dependent conversion of dimer to monomer (data not shown), so that the corresponding two bands were seen by SDS- or native PAGE (Fig. 3, lanes A2 and B1). The smear seen between the dimer and monomer bands in overloaded lane 3 of Fig. 4 is a consequence of this conversion occurring during electrophoresis. A decrease in the stability of the dimer in SDS loading buffer was observed in the absence of b-mercaptoethanol (data not shown). A single band, corresponding to the dimer, was obtained by applying purified DAH7PS in native loading buffer to a native gel (Fig. 3, lane B3). However, when the enzyme was applied in native loading buffer to SDS gels, a very small amount of monomer was also

being susceptible to elimination and hydrolysis [32,33]. Fig. 2 shows that PEP was stable at 60 °C over 30 min but E4P was not. The slight apparent increase in PEP concentration is not significant. The initial delay in the decrease of E4P is due to the cuvette warming from 25 to 60 °C. At 30 min, just less than half the E4P remained. This instability of E4P at elevated temperatures has implications for both continuous and discontinuous DAH7PS assays. Thus, 60 °C was chosen as the temperature for P. furiosus DAH7PS continuous assays, despite this temperature being lower than the optimum growth temperature of P. furiosus. Assays were performed either with excess E4P, or with E4P initiation, or

Fig. 4. SDS­PAGE analysis of the stages of purification of P. furiosus DAH7PS. The cell pellet was resuspended and lysed by sonication at $40 °C. The lysate was heat treated at 70 °C for 30 min and centrifuged. The supernatant was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. SDS­PAGE analysis was performed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. The sample loading buffer contained SDS. Samples were not boiled prior to application.

observed (Fig. 3, lane A4). Resistance to denaturation by SDS has been observed with other multimeric enzymes from hyperthermophilic organisms [34­36] and may be due to their extreme stability. Purification IPTG induction of BL21(DE3)-RIL/pT7-PfuDAH7PS demonstrated tightly regulated, strong expression, with recombinant P. furiosus DAH7PS representing approximately 50% of the total cell protein. Initial trials of cell lysis by sonication on ice in the absence of salt showed that all the expressed DAH7PS was present as monomer with the majority being insoluble (data not shown). The inclusion of salt (200 mM KCl) in the lysis buffer resulted in some insoluble monomers and some soluble dimers. Compared to lysis on ice, lysis at approximately 40 °C resulted in the precipitation of more contaminating protein. Lysis at pH 4.5 or 9.4 in the presence of 40 mM KCl did not improve the amount of active DAH7PS recovered. Lysis at pH 4.5 resulted in insoluble DAH7PS, while lysis at pH 9.4 resulted in soluble, inactive DAH7PS. Further advantage was taken of the thermostability of the enzyme during purification using a heat treatment step. Heat treatment was performed at 70 °C for 30 min. There was no apparent advantage of a centrifugation

step after cell lysis and before heat treatment. A single centrifugation step after heat treatment was sufficient to remove both cell debris from lysis and precipitated protein from heat treatment. The combination of warm lysis and heat treatment followed by centrifugation proved very effective as an initial purification step. The majority of contaminating proteins were removed with a minimal loss of DAH7PS protein (Fig. 4). Following heat treatment, DAH7PS was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. Only one peak of protein was obtained, corresponding to the dimer. SDS­PAGE analysis of the protein fractions resulted in two protein bands after silver staining, corresponding to the dimer and monomer. The final DAH7PS preparation gave the same two bands after SDS­PAGE stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 (Fig. 4). Although both dimer and monomer were detected by SDS-PAGE, due to slow conversion of dimer to monomer by SDS, only one protein band corresponding to the dimer could be detected by native PAGE (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the preparation was more than 98% pure. The gel filtration step appears to give little further purification (Table 1), but the approximate purity figure is a measure of protein only, and does not include other biomolecules such as DNA, etc. DNA was determined to be present in fractions resolved from DAH7PS, eluting after the DAH7PS dimer. The gel filtration step was useful in removing DNA in the purification of DAH7PS. The amount of DNA in the preparation after heat treatment could be limited by the addition of streptomycin sulfate. Characterization The relative molecular mass of the purified recombinant P. furiosus DAH7PS was 29226.0 Æ 1 for the monomer and 58451.0 Æ 8 for the dimer as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The apparent molecular mass of DAH7PS was 57 kDa for the dimer, as determined by gel filtration chromatography. These values are in excellent agreement with that of 29224.5 based on the ORF coding for the DAH7PS protein (262 amino acids) and indicate that the enzyme exists as a dimer. Similar values have been obtained for other subfamily Ib enzymes, which have a Mr of approximately 30,000. Subfamily Ib enzymes include the KDO8PS from A. aeolicus which has a Mr of 29,736 [9]

and the KDO8PS from E. coli which has a Mr of 30,842 [37], both of which exist as tetramers [14,15]. Subfamily Ia DAH7PS enzymes have molecular masses of approximately 39 kDa and include the DAH7PS isozymes from E. coli: DAH7PS(phe), DAH7PS(trp), and DAH7PS(tyr), being a tetramer of 38 kDa subunits, a dimer of 39 kDa subunits, and a dimer of 35 kDa subunits, respectively [20,38,39]. The purified enzyme exists only as a dimer, as only one protein peak was obtained by gel filtration and a single band by native PAGE (Fig. 3, lane B3). The dimer was slowly disrupted by SDS­PAGE (Fig. 3, lane A4), and boiling DAH7PS in the presence of SDS before SDS­PAGE resulted in complete disruption of the dimer so that only monomer was apparent by both SDSand native PAGE (Fig. 3, lanes A3 and B2). However, predominantly dimer was obtained by SDS­PAGE by applying DAH7PS in native loading buffer (Fig. 3, lane A4). DAH7PS was active between pH 5 and 8 (data not shown). Accurate levels of activity cannot be given, as assays measured the loss of PEP, which has a pH dependent extinction coefficient. The extinction coefficient was not determined over a broad pH range. L -Phenylalanine, L -tyrosine, and L -tryptophan were found to be not inhibitors. P. furiosus DAH7PS therefore differs from the Ia subfamily DAH7PS enzymes, which are often present as isozymes that are feedback inhibited by one of these amino acids [1]. The subfamily Ib DAH7PS enzymes appear to be missing a residue that has been predicted to be required for feedback inhibition by the aromatic amino acids in subfamily Ia enzymes [13]. DAH7PS appeared to follow Michaelis­Menten kinetics. The kinetic constants of DAH7PS were Km (PEP) 120 Æ 20 lM, Km (E4P) 28 Æ 4 lM, and kcat 1.5 Æ 0.1 sÀ1 , at 60 °C and pH 6.8. These results are similar to those of the metal dependent KDO8PS from the hyperthermophile A. aeolicus (also a member of subfamily Ib) [9], however the KDO8PS kinetics were determined without the addition of divalent metal ions. Kinetic constants change with temperature and the P. furiosus DAH7PS values may be expected to change similar to those from A. aeolicus KDO8PS, which showed a decrease in Km (PEP) and an increase in Km (A5P) and kcat with increasing temperature. The effect of temperature on enzyme activity is shown in Fig. 5. The Arrhenius plot of log (specific activity) versus 1/T, at temperatures (T in Kelvin) between 25 and 80 °C is linear (R2 ¼ 0:995). The energy of activation calculated from the slope is approximately 88 kJ molÀ1 . This result is very similar to those of the closely related KDO8PS enzymes, also members of the subfamily Ib. KDO8PS from the hyperthermophilic bacterium A. aeolicus had two linear regions between 30 and 60 °C and between 70 and 95 °C with energy of activation values of 67 and 42 kJ molÀ1 , respectively [10]. A change in the

Fig. 5. Effect of temperature on specific activity of purified P. furiosus DAH7PS. Reaction mixtures contained PEP (80 lM) and MnSO4 (100 lM) in 50 mM BTP buffer at pH 6.8 at the required temperature. Assays were initiated with purified P. furiosus DAH7PS (6 ll, 0.043 U) 1 min after the addition of E4P (220 lM).

enzyme mechanism/structure with temperature is suggested to be responsible for the two values. Salmonella typhimurium KDO8PS had an energy of activation value of 96 kJ molÀ1 , measured over the temperature range 15­45 °C [40]. The energy of activation value may be related to the energy of hydrolysis of PEP [11]. Pyrococcus furiosus DAH7PS was thermostable when subjected to heat treatment at 70 °C for 30 min during purification. The enzyme appeared to be stable under assay conditions at 80 °C, as suggested by the linearity of the Arrhenius plot up to 80 °C. When incubated at 95 °C, the enzyme showed much greater thermostability in the presence of 100 lM Mn2þ . After 130 min, 50% of the initial activity remained when Mn2þ was present, however 50% activity remained after only 3 min in the absence of Mn2þ . A similar effect was observed with the arginase from the thermophile Bacillus caldovelox, which showed much higher thermostability in the presence of Mn2þ [41]. The results for DAH7PS are consistent with both the optimum growth temperature for P. furiosus of 100 °C and the thermostability exhibited by other proteins isolated from hyperthermophilic organisms [42]. The enzyme did not display first order denaturation kinetics. Although it is possible that the apparent thermostability was due to reversible denaturation, as the residual activity was measured at the lower temperature of 60 °C, the enzyme does show thermostability in terms of resistance to irreversible thermal inactivation. SDS­PAGE analysis of DAH7PS, maintained at 95 °C over time in the absence of Mn2þ , indicated dissociation of dimer to monomeric species. In contrast, when maintained at 95 °C over time in the presence of Mn2þ , loss of thermostability was due to denaturation of intact dimer (data not shown).

Evidence of both activity and thermostability at elevated temperatures, and the similarity of the recombinant DAH7PS to other closely related enzymes, indicate that the purified recombinant DAH7PS has been isolated in its natural state. The activity of DAH7PS treated with 1 mM EDTA, assayed in the absence of metal ions, was less than 5% of the untreated enzyme, assayed in the presence of Mn2þ . This residual activity may be due to trace metals present in assays, the inability of EDTA to produce 100% metalfree enzyme or the true residual activity of the apoenzyme. When assayed with Mn2þ present, activity of the EDTA-treated DAH7PS was the same as that of the untreated enzyme. These results indicate that a metal ion is required for catalytic activity. Significantly, this report describes a DAH7PS from class IbD that requires a metal ion for activity. B. subtilis DAH7PS was reported as not requiring a metal ion for activity and so the IbD class enzymes have been speculatively classified as nonmetalloenzymes [6,7]. The evidence from B. subtilis on which this prediction is based appears to be inconclusive [5­8,43 and references therein]. It is therefore possible that the IbD class DAH7PS enzymes do require a metal ion for catalysis. A range of divalent metal salts were tested for their ability to restore activity to the EDTA-treated P. furiosus DAH7PS (Table 2). Zn2þ and Cd2þ significantly activated the enzyme compared to Mn2þ . While both the divalent metal ion present and its concentration appear to have some effect on the extinction coefficient of PEP, the same trend is still apparent. In the case of Cd2þ , the enzyme is still significantly activated compared to Mn2þ . Some divalent metal ions gave a large background absorbance reading and were therefore used at lower concentrations. Assessment of reactivation by Fe2þ is complicated by instability of the ferrous ion in aqueous solution resulting in an uncertain concentration of Fe2þ available to the enzyme. Preliminary results indicate that FeSO4 stimulates enzyme activity.

The results of metal ion activation are comparable with those of KDO8PS from the hyperthermophilic bacterium A. aeolicus (also subfamily IbÞ [10] and the E. coli DAH7PS isozymes (subfamily IaÞ [44]. A. aeolicus KDO8PS and the E. coli DAH7PS isozymes showed lower activation with Cd2þ and Zn2þ compared to Mn2þ , but showed a similar ranking of divalent metal ions at a single concentration. The only exception was Zn2þ which highly activated P. furiosus DAH7PS but had a low effect on A. aeolicus KDO8PS and the E. coli DAH7PS isozymes. Primary sequence comparisons may predict a correlation between enzyme reaction and metal ion requirement. IbD class DAH7PS enzymes have all four of the established metal-liganding residues, as do the Ia subfamily DAH7PS enzymes, which have been shown to be metalloenzymes, and the IbK class KDO8PS enzymes from A. aeolicus, Chlamydia psittaci, and Helicobacter pylori that have also been shown to be metalloenzymes [6,7]. Conversely, IbK class KDO8PS enzymes from E. coli, S. typhimurium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pisum sativum lack one of the four established metal-liganding residues [6] and have been reported to be nonmetalloenzymes. This sequence comparison combined with experimental evidence of the metal dependence of P. furiosus DAH7PS reported here may indicate that, contrary to previous suggestions, all of the IbD class DAH7PS enzymes are indeed metal ion dependent. An important issue that has yet to be addressed fully is the role of the metal ion in the mechanism of the metalloproteins DAH7PS and KDO8PS and the relationship to the mechanism of the KDO8PS nonmetalloproteins. The results presented here show that P. furiosus DAH7PS shares characteristics in common with those of the IbK class KDO8PS enzymes from A. aeolicus and E. coli and may help unravel the evolutionary origin of the family I 3-deoxyald-2-ulosonate-phosphate synthase proteins. Note added in proof Since the completion of this manuscript the characterization of DAH7PS from Thermotoga maritima has been published. This enzyme appears to behave similarly to P. furiosus DAH7PS characterized in this study. (J. Wu, D.L. Howe, and R. W.
