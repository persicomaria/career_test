Crystal Structures of Calpain­E64 and ­Leupeptin Inhibitor Complexes Reveal Mobile Loops Gating the Active Site

Department of Biochemistry Queen's University, Kingston Ont., Canada K7L 3N6 The endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, modulates some pathophysiological aspects of calpain signaling. Excess calpain can escape this inhibition and as well, many calpain isoforms and autolytically generated protease core fragments are not inhibited by calpastatin. There is a need, therefore, to develop specific, cell-permeable calpain inhibitors to block uncontrolled proteolysis and prevent tissue damage during brain and heart ischemia, spinal-cord injury and Alzheimer's diseases. Here, we report the first high-resolution crystal structures of rat m-calpain protease core complexed with two traditional, low molecular mass inhibitors, leupeptin and E64. These structures show that access to a slightly deeper, but otherwise papain-like active site is gated by two flexible loops. These loops are divergent among the calpain isoforms giving a potential structural basis for substrate/inhibitor selectivity over other papain-like cysteine proteases and between members of the calpain family.

Introduction
Proteolytic processing of cellular proteins by calcium-activated cysteine proteases, calpains, has become a well-accepted mode of Ca2C signaling in some bacteria, most lower and all higher eukaryotes.1­3 Calpains are active participants in fundamental mammalian cellular processes such as cell migration and associated-cytoskeletal remodeling,4 apoptosis5 and cell cycle progression.6 More specific roles have been established for some calpains including Caenorhabditis elegans sex determination by the tra-3 isoform and alkaline adaptation of Aspergillus nidulans by the PalB isoform.1 One of the most severe consequences of

pathological calpain activation is cell death (necrosis), which is well documented for myocardial ischemia, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury and cerebral ischemia.7­10 Related in vivo injury models and cell culture models have proved that calpain inhibitors protect against necrosis. These inhibitors are effective even when administered in a delayed fashion post-injury, allowing a therapeutic window of opportunity in which calpain-mediated damage can be blocked. Abnormal calpain activation is also linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, calpain relays the toxic effect of extracellular amyloid peptides on neurons to intracellular tau aggregation and neuronal cell death.11­13 This involves the direct calpain-mediated proteolysis of p35 and p39, two cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) modulators, to forms (p25 and p29, respectively) that constitutively activate cdk5. Tau hyperphosphorylation by cdk5 results in its aggregation and leads to cell death. Calpain inhibition attenuates the AD phenotypes in cell culture models, providing an attractive target for AD treatment. Not surprisingly, ongoing efforts are being made to develop specific calpain inhibitors. 14 The endogenous proteinaceous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, inhibits a subset of calpains including the heterodimeric ubiquitous m- and m-calpains, but has no effect on related papain-like cysteine

1314 proteases or monomeric calpains.15,16 Calpastatin's absolute selectivity has sparked much interest towards developing a calpastatin-like synthetic calpain inhibitor. Its mode of action is not understood but the emerging model suggests that inhibition is facilitated via interactions with the penta EF-hand-domains including that of the small subunit of the heterodimeric calpains.17 Accordingly, calpains that do not assemble into heterodimers, or the proteolytic core of calpain released by autolysis might be resistant to calpastatin inhibition. Inhibition of these isoforms under pathological conditions must therefore rely on a different mode of action, preferably one that is easy to administer. One obvious possibility is by blocking the active site. Inhibitors of this type have been isolated, originally from natural sources, as general cysteine protease inhibitors.14 These include the peptidyl aldehyde leupeptin from Streptomyces species (Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-H) and the peptidyl epoxysuccinate E64 from Aspergillus japonicus (trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-4-guanidinobutane). There are no active site-directed inhibitors with absolute specificity for calpain. The known ones also inhibit related cysteine proteases and even the proteasome (e.g. calpain inhibitor I, complex with proteasome). An understanding of the basis for selectivity among known calpain inhibitors would benefit the design of specific inhibitors. Although solving the X-ray crystal structures of rat18 and human19,20 m-calpains in the Ca2C-free form provided a wealth of structural information about the whole enzyme, the active site was not assembled in these structures and could therefore not provide a view of the substrate binding cleft. One of the major problems in testing calpain inhibitors is that the enzyme requires calcium for activity, but Ca2C promotes subunit dissociation as well as aggregation and precipitation.21 Moreover, the active enzyme is rapidly autoproteolyzed. To get around these major drawbacks in calpain structure-based drug design, we employed the well-behaved mI-II protease core region as a crystallization target.22 Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structures of mI-II in complex with leupeptin and E64. The complexes reveal how a papain-like rigid scaffold supported by well-defined secondary structure elements is flanked by two flexible loops, one on either side of the S1 subsite. These loops move in and mould around leupeptin's arginyl moiety, defining the width of the active site and providing the primary structural candidates for calpain selectivity/specificity.

Results and Discussion
The calpain protease core as target for calpain inhibitors We have previously shown that the common calpain inhibitors leupeptin, E64 and calpain

inhibitor I, all of which react at the active site, are also able to inhibit the protease core, DI-II, in isolation.22 In contrast, calpastatin inhibits the intact heterodimeric calpains (80k/21k), having absolutely no inhibitory effect on the isolated protease core. Here, we extend the inhibitory analysis for leupeptin and E64 to mI-II, by providing a steadystate inhibition treatment. Leupeptin and E64 form covalent reversible and irreversible calpain complexes, respectively. As a result, the kinetic parameters of inhibition do not conform to the classical competitive inhibitor model, even if the inhibitors compete with substrate for the active site. Therefore, we determined and have reported here IC50 values as concentrations required to decrease the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) by half. The catalytic efficiency was obtained from the direct Michaelis­Menten plots in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitor. As expected, increasing the concentration of leupeptin (1, 5, 10, 20 mM) incrementally depressed the hyperbolic plot of reactive rate versus substrate concentration (Figure 1(A)) with a concomitant decrease in catalytic efficiency (Figure 1(B)). The catalytic efficiency followed a hyperbolic decrease with the IC50 value of 3.0 mM. This value is about an order of magnitude lower than that reported previously for the intact calpain (w0.270 mM).23 We have previously shown that the protease core performs better at elevated CaCl2 levels or higher ionic strength, and have postulated that this effect mimics the structural support provided in the intact heterodimer. We also established that under these conditions the enzyme shows an improved kcat but not KM. Since leupeptin requires hemithioacetal formation with the active site cysteine, a lower kcat translates into a higher IC50. In our current assay we chose a moderate ionic strength (200 mM NaCl) and CaCl2 concentration (10 mM) that do not fully potentiate the core. It is not surprising therefore, that the kcat is nearly an order of magnitude lower for the catalytic core,22 which explains the correspondingly higher IC50 value. Despite its weaker binding compared to leupeptin, E64 forms an irreversible adduct with calpain, being very efficient at completely inhibiting the enzyme on a slightly longer time scale.22 The succinyl-leucine-tyrosine-aminomethyl coumarin (SLY-MCA) hydrolysis inhibition assay confirmed the poor binding ability of E64 with an IC50 value of 100(G15) mM at 10 mM CaCl2 and 200 mM NaCl (Figure 1(C) and (D)). This value is almost two orders of magnitude greater that that observed for the intact enzyme (w1.53 mM).23 Therefore, we performed the assay at 100 mM CaCl2 and 200 mM NaCl and obtained a much lower IC50 value of 55(G10) mM (Figure 1(D) and (E)). It is worth noting that under the crystallization conditions the high ionic strength w1.5 M NaCl and 10 mM CaCl2 would render the protease core much better for inhibitor complexing and binding with an improved IC50 value. We conclude that mI-II can

substitute for the full-length m-calpain in the design and screening for active site inhibitors. Inhibitor complex formation and crystallization A major difference between calpains and the other papain-like cysteine proteases is that the former require Ca2C-induced active site assembly, whereas once the latter have undergone zymogen processing they always present an accessible assembled active site. Once formed in the presence of Ca2C the irreversible mI-II­E64 complex is resistant to the Ca2C-induced conformational changes in mI-II, withstanding Ca2C removal,

which collapses the active site (not shown). E64 remains covalently attached through the thioester bond formed with the active site thiol (Cys115). Because of the need to form this bond we made the complex using active mI-II in the presence of tenfold excess inhibitor and 10 mM CaCl2. We subsequently removed the excess inhibitor as well as CaCl2 by performing an anion exchange step using Q-Sepharose, essentially treating the complex like the underivatized mI-II for the remainder of the purification and storage procedures. The derivatized complex was completely inactive being unable to autolyze or hydrolyze SLY-MCA (data not shown). Its mass was determined by

1316 electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) analysis and corresponds to that of mI-II plus E64 (data not shown). In addition, compared with native mI-II, the E64 complex shows quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (IWF) change upon Ca2C titration (Figure 1(F)). The E64-induced quenching is likely due to proximity of E64 to Trp298. We previously determined that this residue is the major contributor to IWF change in the protease core, also contributing to the terminal stages of the sigmoidal transition.24 During crystallization, the E64 complex behaved very similarly to the recently described D106A mI-II mutant24 and produced identical type crystals in the space group P212121. These crystals diffracted with a resolution ° better than 2 A at the CHESS synchrotron source (Table 1). Because leupeptin forms a reversible hemithioacetal derivative with the active site cysteine, mI-II­ leupeptin complex formation and subsequent purification required the uninterrupted presence of 10 mM CaCl2 to keep the active site from collapsing and losing the inhibitor. In addition, during the Q-Sepharose and buffer exchange steps excess of leupeptin was added to maintain inhibitor occupancy in the derivatized complex. In spite of these precautions, the purified derivative was not fully inhibited and could readily digest SLY-MCA. The protease core is very resistant to autolysis but after several days it loses this characteristic, which would certainly influence its crystallization. We therefore had to add excess inhibitor (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2!) to the partially derivatized complex prior to crystallization. Crystals of the same form as the E64 complex grew but their size and quality was not suitable for data collection. Several larger crystals also grew in a few days but only in very few drops

The structure of the mI-II­leupeptin complex The overall structure of the Ca2C-bound mI-II­ leupeptin derivative aligns very well with that of the Ca2C-bound free enzyme with a root mean ° squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.5 A (Figure 2(A)). Additional electron density was readily observed around the active site prior to inhibitor refinement (not shown). The leupeptin structure was easily placed within the extra density and further refined (Figure 3(A)). In the refined mI-II­leupeptin com° plex, the average B-factor for the inhibitor (15.6 A2) was slightly lower than the average for the protein ° ° (16.4 A2). The inhibitor stretches w15 A across the S1, S2 and S3 sites, deep within a canyon-like groove generated by steep surfaces provided by domain I (blue) on one side and domain II (cyan) on the opposite side (Figures 2(B) and 4(B)). The ° groove is tightest around the S1 site (!7 A across, ° w15 A deep), which is filled by the C-terminal Arg3 residue of the inhibitor (R3 in Figure 2(B)). The groove continues at the S2 site where the central Leu2 residue buries its side-chain within a deep pocket (P2 site, Figures 2(B) and 4(B)). The groove ° ends in a wider opening (O15 A) at the S3 site, where the N-terminal acetyl leucine moiety lies (P3 site, Figures 2(B) and 4(B)). Extensive interactions help stabilize leupeptin at the active site of mI-II (Figure 4(A) and (B)). Three salt bridges form on the side-chain of the P1 site Arg3: a double salt bridge from Glu72 side-chain to ° ° Nh1 (2.9 A) and Nh2 (2.9 A), and a salt bridge from

1317 ° Glu261 side-chain to N3 (2.9 A). In addition to the hemithioacetal bond formed with the active site Cys115, the thioacetal oxygen of the inhibitor's Arg3 is further stabilized through a hydrogen bond ° with the backbone amide of Cys115 (3.1 A). This oxygen also comes into close contact with the ° carbonyl of Gly113 (3.3 A), while the distance to ° Gln109 is significantly greater (3.3 A) than seen in ° the papain­leupeptin complex (2.9 A). The sidechain of Arg3 forms van der Waals contacts with Leu260 and Glu261 side-chains on one side and the backbone of Gly113 and Gly207 on the other side. The P2 site Leu2 residue is stabilized via two hydrogen bonds formed between its backbone amide and carbonyl and those of the highly conserved Gly208 (Figure 4(B)). In addition, van der Waals interactions with the side-chains of Ser251 and Ala273 and with the backbone of His272 help place the P2 leucine side-chain within the S2 pocket (Figure 4(A) and (B)). No polar contacts are made between the P3 and S3 sites, with the P3 leucine side-chain merely wrapping across the extended backbone marked by Gly207 and 208 and together with the N-terminal acetyl capping group (Ac) pointing towards the solvent (Figure 4(A) and (B)). However, additional stabilizing interactions to this portion of the inhibitor come from crystal contacts and several ordered water molecules at this interface (not shown). This might explain why the leupeptin N terminus is so well defined in spite of little contact to the S3 site (Figure 2(B) and (C)). The structure of the mI-II­E64 complex The E64 complex overlaps onto the native mI-II ° structure with an r.m.s.d. of 0.3 A. The additional electron density around the unprimed region of the active site of the E64 complex observed after the original round of refinement with the mI-II structure (chain B of PDB code 1KXR) as a model was not continuous nor was it as well defined as for leupeptin. Nevertheless, the E64 structure could be fitted within the density and after several rounds of refinement an improved map was obtained (Figure 3(B)). The quality of the inhibitor map is also confirmed by the average B-factor for E64 ° (35.3 A2), which is only slightly larger than the ° overall average B-factor for the protein (34.2 A2, Table 1). The density was best around the P2 leucyl site, whereas the 4-guanidinobutane moiety is less well defined, perhaps being more flexible (average ° B-factor 40.4 A2). Interestingly, the density for the bond between Cys115 thiol and the C-2 carbon of E64 is also ill-defined, even though the density and position of the surrounding atoms physically map this bond in the correct place. This is not surprising given that the E64 density from a full-length m-calpain derivative in the absence of Ca2C was entirely absent even at the putative Cys105­C-2 bond, suggesting that this bond is highly flexible (Pal, G. personal communication). In mI-II E64 extends very much like leupeptin within the deep

active site groove from the S1 oxyanion hole at the Gln109 side-chain to the S3 site. As described previously25 the orientation of the P2 leucyl sidechain defines the direction of binding, with leupeptin binding to mimick a substrate and E64 binding in the reversed orientation. The interactions between E64 and mI-II are less extensive than those observed for leupeptin and mI-II. Three strong hydrogen bonds are detectable ° between E64's O-1 and Gln109 N32 (2.8 A), and d1 ° ) at the between E64's O-2 and N of His272 (2.7 A P1/S1 site and E64's O-4 and Gly208 amide at the ° P2/S2 site (2.9 A). These are shown by dotted lines in Figure 4(C). In spite of the reverse orientation of the P2 leucyl side-chain, it forms similar van der Waals contacts within the deep S2 site as seen for leupeptin. The P3/S3 site is stabilized by a longrange hydrogen bond as N-5 of the 4-guanidinobu° tane end of E64 comes within 3.3 A of the carbonyl oxygen of Gly207. Otherwise, the P3 moiety of E64 wraps around the conserved Gly208-Gly209 region similar to leupeptin (Figure 4(C) and (D)), being mostly exposed to the solvent. Crystal contacts involving the 4-guanidinobutane group are absent,

which might help explain the flexibility of E64 at the P3 site compared to leupeptin. Active site plasticity and consequences for calpain activity and inhibition We have accumulated four different crystal structures for the Ca2C-bound mI-II protease core: the two independent molecules in the originally solved C115S native mI-II and the two inhibitor complexes presented here. We now have an unprecedented opportunity to compare these structures to gain insight into the changes in conformation that occur due to inhibitor binding. The inhibitor complexes were therefore overlapped onto the native structures and the r.m.s.d. for the a-carbon atoms was plotted according to residue number (Figure 5(A) and (B)). As expected, many of the Ca coordinate deviations occur on the surface and can be attributed to changes in crystal contacts among the three different crystal forms. More interesting however are the regions that contact the inhibitor. These regions have been designated by horizontal bars within Figure 5(A) and (B) and

foundation of the active site, a rigid surface made up of mainly backbone elements that are well supported by secondary structural elements and hydrophobic core interactions (Figure 6). This

In mI-II the loops are found in the open conformation, whereas in the leupeptin complex they are in the closed conformation (see also Figure 2).

foundation likely does not mould onto inhibitors or substrates but rather the reverse must apply. In contrast, two of the barred regions in the leupeptin complex delineate loop structures on either side of the active site (residues 69­82 and 251­261), which define the highest points around the active site groove. It may be noted that the loop made up by residues 251­261 also shows the largest difference between the two independent molecules in the native mI-II structure, indicating a large degree of flexibility. The inhibitor-bound structures are more similar in this region to molecule B than they are to molecule A of the native mI-II structure. ° These loops show the largest Ca r.m.s.d. (nearly 3 A ° for the E64 complex; for leupeptin but only 1.5 A Figure 5(A) and (B)). It appears that some degree of flexibility in the 251­261 loop may be necessary to allow the inhibitor (or substrate) to gain access to the active site and thus this loop may be considered to act as a gate for the active site. Loop 69-82 moves in to facilitate formation of the double salt bridge between Glu72 and the leupeptin guanidino group. A similar movement is also made by the 251-262 loop, which facilitates the interaction of Leu260 and

Glu261 with the rest of the Arg3 side-chain. The latter loop is quite flexible in all three structures but becomes more stable in the leupeptin complex, which shows the best electron density for Leu260 and Glu261 of the three. In addition to the backbone shift, there is an even greater change in the sidechain conformation as captured best for Glu72 in Figure 5(C) and (D). Interestingly, since E64 does not fill the S1 site as extensively as leupeptin does, the changes do not involve loop 69-82, but merely the more proximal loop 251-262 (Figure 5(B)). In contrast to the active site plasticity observed at the S1 site, the S2 and S3 sites are less dynamic and are made up of highly conserved residues. It is unlikely that these regions will bind substrates very differently from the way the two inhibitors are bound. On the other hand, the mobile loops show the highest degree of sequence dissimilarity and variable length among the calpain isoforms. We postulate that the plasticity brought about by these mobile loops translates into substrate/inhibitor selectivity among the different calpain isoforms. For instance, p94 (CAPN3) has a shorter DI-loop

1322 (corresponding to residues 69­82 in m-calpain) and a much larger DII-loop (corresponding to residues 251­261 in m-calpain) (Figure 6). Our group has recently shown that DII-loop of p94, known as insertion sequence I (IS1), modulates the activity of p94 by directly interacting at and occluding the active site.26 When IS1 is released during autolysis as an internal "pro" segment, the enzyme exposes an active site flanked by different mobile loop sequences, which could potentially cleave different substrates from those cleaved by the heterodimeric calpains. Comparison of leupeptin­ and E64­mI-II calpain complexes with those of papain and cathepsin K The structures of about a dozen papain-like cysteine proteases, including parasite and plant enzymes as well as mammalian lysosomal cathepsins, show that these enzymes share a common fold. The mature enzymes are composed of two domains just like the calpain protease core. Domain I is w70 residues shorter than that of calpain. Domain II has a much closer structural resemblance with that of calpain. In addition, active site residues from both domains come together to form an inter-domain active site cleft. The conserved residues within the active site of the Ca2C-bound mI-II and related papain-like cysteine proteases overlap very well, despite the poor overall sequence similarity. Several reviews have compared structural features of the papain-like enzymes and their inhibitor complexes.25,27­30 Papain defines a well-conserved structural scaffold for endopeptidase activity (9PAP31). Essentially, there is no occlusion of the active site cleft at either the S or S 0 sites, just as we observed in the structure of mI-II. On the other hand, several related enzymes have acquired structural features within the active site region, such as the occluding loop of cathepsin B or the mini-chain of cathepsin H, which limits their activity to that of a carboxypeptidase and an aminopeptidase, respectively. The p94 isoform of calpain also presents an internal occlusion of the active site, on an otherwise highly conserved papain-like scaffold. For a better understanding of the structural basis of calpain inhibitor/substrate selectivity/specificity we have overlapped the structures of the calpain­ leupeptin complex with the papain­leupeptin complex (1POP32) and the calpain­E64 complex with the E64­cathepsin K complex (1ATK33) by aligning the conserved active site residues

(Figure 7). One of the most striking differences between the active site of calpain and that of papain or cathepsins B and K, is that the former's cleft is very deep. This is especially true where the putative scissile bond occurs, whereas clefts in the latter two are shallow throughout the length of the active site (Figures 2(B) and (C) and 7). As described for the mI-II complexes, both inhibitors lie very similarly in the S1­S3 subsites of the active site in an extended conformation. The P1 (Arg3) and P3 (Ac-Leu1) sites of leupeptin are found in slightly different orientations (Figure 7(A)­(D)). In papain, similar interactions stabilize Arg3 at the backbone level involving the active site Cys25 and oxyanion hole Gln29 on one side and Asp158 on the other side. The Arg3 side-chain is rotated w1808 around the Cg­Cd bond compared to the mI-II complex, pointing in the solvent near a smooth and wide S1 site. In contrast, leupeptin's Arg3 side-chain in the mI-II complex is heavily stabilized by contacts from both domains into what appears to be an induced and much tighter S1 site (Figure 2(B)). The binding of the P2 site Leu2 backbone is nearly identical in papain and calpain with two conserved backbonederived hydrogen bonds from domain I Gly66 (Gly208 in mI-II). In both leupeptin complexes Leu2 side-chain fits loosely into the well-defined S2 binding pocket, which is lined by uncharged residues originating in domain II (Figures 4(A) and (B) and 7(C) and (D)). It appears that the Leu2 sidechain in papain fits deeper within this pocket with a different rotation around the Cb­Cg bond. Presumably, larger side-chains can fit at this position in calpain. In papain, leupeptin is restricted from fully extending at the S3 site due to the protruding Tyr67 side-chain (Figure 7(D)). Nevertheless, the P3 subsite Leu1 side-chain complements the surface of a solvent-accessible pocket lined by the Tyr61Tyr67 loop with the rim defined by the highly conserved Gly65-Gly66 residues (207­208 in mI-II). In calpain no surface complementarity is achieved at the P3/S3 interface as a much smoother S3 site is presented. The differences in the mode of binding of leupeptin to papain and mI-II may account for the differences in dissociation constants, with leupeptin binding w100-fold tighter to papain (KdZ10K9 M). There are more extensive inhibitor­enzyme contacts observed at the P1/S1 site of calpain, which are likely induced after hemithioacetal formation. However, the greater surface complementarity at the P3/S3 subsites in the leupeptin­papain complex

respectively. The identity level between isoforms is indicated in black (100%), green (R75%), and yellow (R50%). Residues that coordinate Ca2C through their side-chain are highlighted in red with a black s below the alignment. Backbone coordinations are marked with a black b below the alignment. Conservation of R104 and E333 is indicated by blue highlights. Active site residues are shown in bold below the alignment. Additional residues that interact with leupeptin and E64 as seen in the leupeptin and E64 complexes are colored red and are marked with red stars below the alignment, unless they are specific for leupeptin or E64. In these cases they are colored below the alignment either green (leupeptin) or magenta (E64). The mA213/mG302 residue position is colored orange.35 Above the alignment the secondary structure elements are shown with the sheets and helices numbered and colored as in our original publication.22 The bars correspond to regions that have a different conformation in the leupeptin (green) and E64 (magenta) complex compared to the native mI-II.

compared to the leupeptin­calpain complex and the greater accessibility of the active site cleft may result in the observed selectivity of leupeptin by papain. In papain the restrictive geometry of the S2/S3 sites appears to limit the combination of peptidyl sidechains that can fit. Whereas in calpain a much greater selection of residues is expected to fit, as the P3 position is essentially solvent-exposed, allowing

the P2 position to achieve variable depth within the S2 pocket. Larger side-chains at the P2 position might prove to make better inhibitors of calpain, whereas the extensive contacts with the P1 position suggest that Arg is a good candidate at this position. Analysis of the E64 interaction with cathepsin K suggests that the interactions are essentially identical in cathepsin K and mI-II and place the

1324 inhibitor in a direction opposite to that of substrate binding (Figure 7(E)). Minor differences in the interactions with mI-II are the contacts with the 4-guanidinobutane P3 moiety and an additional backbone­backbone hydrogen bond at the S2-P2 ° site between E64 N-1 and Asn161 O (3.3 A). Surprisingly, the 4-guanidinobutane density is also poorly defined in cathepsin K. This is in spite of some observed surface complementarity to the S3 pocket and additional stabilization of the P3 site via two salt bridges to the N-4 position of the inhibitor: ° ° Glu59 O (2.6 A) and Asp61 Od1 (2.9 A). E64 does not show selectivity for cathepsin K over calpain, being only a slightly better binder to the former. Achieving calpain selectivity The mechanism behind peptide hydrolysis by cysteine proteases has been tested extensively and is valid also for the calpains. Less understood is calpain substrate/inhibitor selectivity.34 A broad interpretation of the published calpain proteolysis data suggests that calpains cleave substrates at inter-domain exposed regions. In light of our results we agree with this view and explain it by considering the depth and width of the active site cleft especially in the vicinity of the putative scissile bond (Figure 2). Due to the observed constraints, we propose that protein substrates will likely have to achieve a fully extended conformation with the backbone stretching much like that seen in the mI-II­ leupeptin structure. An induced fit will follow near the S1 site as the mobile loops, which define the width of the active site, move in to stabilize tighter substrates as seen for leupeptin. In some cases these loops might not move inwards or indeed could move outwards, thus allowing access of bulkier substrates to a wider cleft (compare Figures 2 and 5(D)). Our analysis of the S2 sites suggests a similarity in preference between calpains and many other papain-like proteases, suggesting that the selectivity must be achieved somewhere else. The S3 site is a good candidate for contributing to the selectivity of substrates/inhibitors for papain and cathepsin K but it probably has less influence on calpain selectivity. The sequence variation and length of the mobile loops are probably the best candidates for conferring selectivity among the calpain isoforms and the papain-like cysteine protease superfamily.

followed by affinity purification on Ni-NTA (Qiagen) and gel filtration using Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia). Inhibitor derivatization involved mixing the S-200 fractions containing the core with a tenfold molar excess of inhibitor, leupeptin or E64, in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The derivatized core was quickly tested for activity as previously described using the peptide substrate succinyl-leucinetyrosine-aminomethyl coumarin (SLY-MCA; Sigma) as a fluorescent substrate to check that the preparation was fully derivatized, which would insure that the complexes do not undergo Ca2C-dependent autolysis. The derivatized cores were further purified by FPLC Q-Sepharose chromatography (Pharmacia). Because E64 forms an irreversible complex with cysteine proteases by reacting covalently with the active site cysteine, neither excess inhibitor nor CaCl2 was added during this step or during the subsequent buffer exchange. In contrast, leupeptin forms a reversible complex with cysteine proteases requiring that both excess leupeptin (10 mM) and CaCl2 (10 mM) were present for the Q-Sepharose and buffer exchange steps. Inhibition assay Steady-state kinetic assays of 2.5 mM mI-II with SLYMCA were done in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM or 100 mM CaCl2, 0.015­1.0 mM SLYMCA without or with leupeptin (1, 5, 10 and 20 mM) or E64 (10, 50, 100 mM), in a final volume of 1 ml. MCA release was monitored in a LS50B Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrometer set with excitation and emission wavelengths at 360 nm and 460 nm, respectively. The steady-state parameters (kcat, KM) were obtained by direct fitting of the data to the Michaelis­Menten equation. The inhibitor concentration required for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) was obtained from the plot of catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) against inhibitor concentration, which decayed hyperbolically. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements were performed in a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer at 22 8C using a stirrer-adapted 4 ml cuvette (Helma) as described.22 The reaction buffer was the same as that used for activity measurements against SLY-MCA, and the protein concentration of mI-II­E64 core was w1 mM. CaCl2 (50 mM) dissolved in the reaction buffer was continuously pumped (4 ml/minute, Harvard Apparatus pump 22) through a tube into the cuvette using a 250 ml microsyringe (Hamilton-microliter 1000 series gastight). Crystallization and structure determination Crystallization of mI-II­inhibitor complexes in the presence of Ca2C was performed as described for the D106A mI-II by expanding screening conditions around 1.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0) and 10 mM CaCl2.24 Under these conditions we produced two P212121 crystals, the D106A mI-II form for the mI-II­E64 complex and a new form for the mI-II­leupeptin complex (Table 1). Both crystal forms contained a single protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystals were cryo-protected prior to data collection by serial soakings (each for up to five minutes) in stabilization solutions containing increasing percentages of glycerol. For higher resolution on the smaller mI-II­E64 crystals, X-ray diffraction data were
