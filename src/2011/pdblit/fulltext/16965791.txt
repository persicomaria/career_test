Understanding the interaction of Arf and Hdm2 has recently become a central issue in cancer biology. In response to hyperproliferative signals, p14Arf stabilizes p53 by binding to Hdm2 and inhibits the ubiquitination and subsequent proteosome-dependent degradation of p53. The medical importance of the Arf-Hdm2-p53 regulatory system is highlighted by the ®nding that either p53 or p14Arf are lost or modi®ed in virtually all human cancers. Isolated Arf and Hdm2 domains are dynamically disordered in solution, yet they retain the ability to interact in vitro and in cellular assays. Upon binding, domains of both Arf and Hdm2 undergo a dramatic transition from disordered conformations to extended structures comprised of b-strands. The presence of domains from both proteins are necessary and suf®cient for the formation of the highly stable extended b structures. We have mapped sites within Arf and Hdm2 that interact at a resolution of ®ve amino acid residues using surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry con®rm the presence of multiple interaction domains within each protein. Both p14Arf (human) and p19Arf (mouse) interact with Hdm2 through two short motifs present in their N termini. The Arf interacting region of Hdm2 is also composed of two short sequences located in the central acidic domain, between residues 235-264 and 270-289. The bindinginduced structural transition is also induced by short peptides, 15 amino acids in length, that contain the binding motifs. Micro-injection and live cell imaging of proteins tagged with ¯uorescent labels was used to con®rm the in vivo function of the interaction domains. Arf and Hdm2 thus appear to interact through a novel mechanism that exerts control over the cell division cycle. The novel molecular mechanism of interaction and the limited size of the protein domains involved provide opportunities for the development of anticancer therapeutics.

Molecular Basis of Arf and Hdm2 Interactions

Introduction
Disruption of cell cycle control mechanisms contributes signi®cantly to the development of cancer in humans.1 The INK4a/Arf gene locus has been shown to encode two unrelated proteins, p16Ink4a and p14Arf, from alternative but partially overlapping reading frames.2 These proteins independently target two cell cycle control pathways: p16Ink4a inhibits Cdk4 and Cdk6 within the Rb pathway,3 and p14Arf inhibits the oncoprotein Hdm2 within the p53 pathway.4 Disruption in mice of either the entire INK4a/Arf locus5 or only exon 1b that gives rise to p19Arf,6 the mouse Arf ortholog of p14Arf, leads to multi-type tumor growth and early death, identifying Arf as a bona ®de tumor suppressor. Further, the INK4a/Arf locus is frequently disrupted in human cancers;7 however, a clear demarcation of effects from INK4a and/or Arf is not yet available. It has been suggested, however, that disruption of INK4a does not contribute to spontaneous tumor formation in mice and that Arf disruption accounts for the high rate of spontaneous tumor formation in INK4a/Arf-null mice.1 Together, these data suggest that loss of Arf function is a major contributor to human cancers. Arf, in concert with cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressors such as p53 and Rb, plays a central role in cellular responses to hyperproliferative signals. For example, Arf expression is activated by overexpression of proteins involved in mitogenic signaling, such as Myc,8 E1A,9 E2F1,10 Ras,11 and v-Abl.12 Activation of Arf leads to stabilization of p5313 ± 16 followed by cell cycle arrest. Arf, therefore, connects the Rb and p53 pathways1 so that excessive proliferative signaling via the Rb pathway activates arrest mechanisms controlled by p53. p14Arf stabilizes p53 by interfering with an autoregulatory loop involving p53 and Hdm2 (Mdm2 in mice)17 that normally maintains p53 at low levels. The positive component of this auto-regulatory loop involves activation of Mdm2 transcription by p53.18 The negative component has several facets. First, Mdm2 binds p5319 and inhibits the transactivation function of p53.20,21 Second, Mdm2 shuttles p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and facilitates p53 degradation.22,23 Third, Mdm2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase toward p53 within the ubiquitin-dependent 26 S proteosome pathway.24 ± 26 Thus, Mdm2 inhibits p53 activity in the nucleus through multiple and diverse mechanisms. Balance between the positive and negative components of this auto-regulatory system is essential for cell survival. Arf inhibits the negative components of the p53Mdm2 auto-regulatory loop by interfering with several of Mdm2's activities toward p53. First, by binding Mdm2, Arf inhibits Mdm2-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 which leads to stabilization and activation of p53.27 Second, Arf inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 toward p53 in vitro25,28 and is thought to do so

in vivo.28,29 Finally, Arf binds and sequesters Mdm2 in the nucleolus, physically separating Mdm2 and p53 in different sub-cellular compartments.30 ± 32 Importantly, direct interaction between Arf and Mdm2 is required for the multiple mechanisms of p53 stabilization, and we and others have elucidated domains of Arf and Mdm2 that are responsible for these interactions. Human and mouse Arf are highly basic proteins ($20 % Arg residues) of 132 and 169 residues, respectively, that localize to nucleoli. The extreme N-terminal segments of the two proteins are very similar (17/29 identity; 21/29 similarity) and contain a repeated motif of eight or nine residues that contains hydrophobic residues ¯anked by Arg residues.33 Exon 1b of the human and mouse p16Ink4a/Arf locus uniquely encodes the ®rst 62 and 63 amino acid residues of human and mouse Arf, respectively, while exon 2 encodes the C-terminal domains. An alternative reading frame within exon 2 also encodes the central segment of p16Ink4a.2 Importantly, peptides containing highly conserved N-terminal residues of human or mouse Arf have been shown to possess biological activity.28,32,33 For example, a peptide containing the N-terminal 37 amino acid residues of mouse Arf (termed mArfN37) localizes to nucleoli, binds and sequesters Hdm2 within nucleoli, and activates p53 leading to cell cycle arrest.32,33 Additionally, a 20 amino acid residue peptide from the human Arf N terminus inhibits Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 and activates p53 in vivo.28 Further study of the Arf N terminus has shown that the two repeated motifs within mArfN37 bind individually to Hdm2 and are both required for normal Arf function.32 Also, two segments of p14Arf, residues 1-14 and 82-101,32,34 are reported to mediate interactions with Hdm2, but the second of these is found in a different region of the polypeptide. Nucleolar localization of mouse and human Arf is speci®ed by the amino acid sequence RRPR (the nucleolar localization signal, NoLS); the NoLS in p19Arf is found between residues 31-34 and in p14Arf between residues 87-90. Interestingly, when Arf binds Mdm2 (or Hdm2), the Arf NoLS is masked and nucleolar colocalization of the Arf/ Mdm2 complex relies on the exposure of a cryptic NoLS within the RING domain of Mdm2.31,32 Despite the wealth of information available on how Arf functions in cells, detailed information on the Hdm2-bound state of mArfN37, or the mechanism of Hdm2 binding or nucleolar localization, is completely lacking. Mdm2 is a multifunctional protein that is reported to interact with p53,17 CBP/p300,35 E2F1,36,37 Rb,38 L5,39 TBP40 and Arf.30,32,33 The human (Hdm2) and mouse (Mdm2) orthologs are 72 % identical and can functionally substitute for one another. The N-terminal domain of $100 amino acid residues adopts a globular, helical structure and binds a small peptide within the p53 N terminus; this interaction inhibits the transcriptional activation function of p53.19 ± 21 Two zinc-

265 biosensor surface using a covalently linked His antibody (Figure 1). The two Hdm2 fragments did not bind a control surface that lacked HismArfN37 (data not shown). We veri®ed the binding results discussed above in a biological setting by monitoring the interaction of p19Arf and Hdm2 fragments in NIH 3T3 cells that lack the gene for Arf using ¯uorescence microscopy. p19Arf was tagged with GFP and expressed in cells, as described,30,32 while Hdm2 was chemically tagged with the ¯uorescent dye Texas Red2 and introduced into cells by microinjection. Figure 2(b) shows that GFP-p19Arf is localized in nucleoli after transfection. In contrast, Hdm2 210-304 is evenly dispersed in the nucleoplasm after microinjection in the absence of p19Arf (Figure 2(c)). When GFP-p19Arf and Hdm2 210-304 are introduced into cells together, the two proteins become colocalized within nucleoli (Figure 2(d) and (e)). The smaller fragment of Hdm2, Hdm2 210-275, exhibits similar localization properties in the absence and presence of GFP-p19Arf (Figure 2(f)(h)). Together, the SPR and cell localization results show that a $100 amino acid residue central segment of Hdm2 interacts with Arf and that fragments containing this segment can be sequestered within nucleoli in the same manner as shown previously for full-length Hdm2.30,32

binding motifs have been identi®ed in Mdm2, a C4 zinc ®nger motif (residues 305-325) and a C3HC4 RING domain (residues 438-478).41 The latter domain has been shown to bind zinc ions, mediate ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53 in vitro24,25 and to bind RNA.42,43 The Arf-binding domain of Hdm2 has been mapped to amino acid residues 210-304 (termed Hdm2 210-304).32 Between humans and mice, this segment is 92 % similar and, in contrast to Arg-rich Arf, is highly acidic (for Hdm2, 32 % Asp/Glu, predicted pI $3.2; for Mdm2, 33 % Asp/Glu; predicted pI $3.5). This central segment has been shown to bind N-terminal fragments of mouse Arf, including 1-37, 1-14 and 26-37.32 Further, a peptide composed of the ®rst 20 amino acid residues of human p14Arf has been shown to bind the central, acidic segment of Hdm2 and to inhibit Hdm2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 in vitro.28 Here, the interaction motif within Hdm2 was mapped to residues 212-244. The studies summarized above contribute signi®cantly to our understanding of the cellular functions of Arf and Hdm2 but provide little insight into the physical and structural basis for these functions, such as the binding of Arf to Hdm2, nucleolar colocalization, inhibition of Hdm2dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53, and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53. Here, we report the identi®cation of small peptide segments within Arf and Hdm2 that contribute to their interactions and mediate nucleolar colocalization. Further, we show that Arf and Hdm2, in pure form, are dynamically disordered in solution and that, when mixed in vitro, they adopt highly stable b-sheet structures. The b-structures prepared in vitro, however, are extended networks and may be relevant to the structures that form when Arf and Hdm2 interact in cells.

Results
Small segments of Arf and Hdm2 participate in Arf/Hdm2 interactions We have previously shown that a fragment of mouse p19Arf containing the N-terminal 37 amino acid residues (mArfN37) can bind Hdm2, cause the relocalization of Hdm2 to nucleoli, and induce cell cycle arrest in MEFs.30 Further, we showed that a fragment of Hdm2 containing amino acid residues 140-350 could bind mArfN37 and be relocalized to nucleoli in a mArfN37-dependent manner, and that a smaller fragment, Hdm2 210-304, could bind mArfN37.32 Because mArfN37 is a relatively small polypeptide, we reasoned that it may bind a correspondingly small segment of Hdm2. To test this hypothesis and to monitor Arf/Hdm2 binding reactions quantitatively, we prepared Hdm2 constructs spanning amino acids 210-304 and 210-275 and determined whether they could bind mArfN37 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Both Hdm2 210-304 and 210-275 bind tightly to Histagged mArf37 that was immobilized on the SPR

Structural properties of mArfN37 and Arf-binding Hdm2 fragments Knowing that mArfN37 and Hdm2 210-304 (and Hdm2 210-275) interact and that the interactions can occur in cells, we investigated the structural properties of these domains. Our previous work showed that mArfN37 is unstructured in aqueous solution and that the peptide adopts a bi-helical conformation in 30 % tri¯uoroethanol.33 CD spectra for Hdm2 210-304 and 210-275 (Figure 3(a)) show that these two Arf-binding polypeptides are also unstructured. The CD spectrum for mArfN37 is also shown, for reference. A similar conclusion can be reached on the basis of the 1H-15N NMR 2D correlation spectra for Hdm2 210-304 and 210-275 (Figure 3(b) and (c)). While chemical shift assignments have not been made, the observed chemical shift values in both the 1H and 15N dimensions cluster near random coil values44 and are consistent with a general lack of secondary and tertiary structure.45 Further, heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE

values for Hdm2 210-275 are all negative and are consistent with our conclusions that the Arf-binding segment of Hdm2, prior to binding Arf, is conformationally disordered and highly ¯exible (data not shown).

267 less than 25 % solvent exposed. The remainder of the polypeptide is predicted to be unstructured and solvent exposed. The opposed charge characteristics of mArfN37 and Hdm2 210-304 suggest that electrostatic forces play a role in the interactions between the two polypeptides. The prediction of two b-strands in both mArfN37 and Hdm2 210-304 suggests that b-strand secondary structure is involved in Arf/Hdm2 interactions. b -Strand secondary structure forms when Arf and Hdm2 interact Interestingly and in accordance with the secondary structure predictions, a striking transition from random conformations to b-strand secondary structure is observed when mArfN37 and Hdm2 210-304 (and Hdm2 210-275) are mixed (Figure 5(a)). This structural transition is induced when mArfN37 is added to an Hdm2 fragment and when an Hdm2 fragment is added to mArfN37. Data from gel ®ltration chromatography and NMR spectroscopy shows that the mArfN37 and Hdm2 210-304 do not form a bimolecular complex involving small numbers of molecules, but rather form large, extended structures with predominantly b-strand secondary

We used secondary structure prediction methods to gain further insight into the structural properties of the N-terminal segment of Arf, and the Arfbinding segment of Hdm2. Our previous analysis of mArfN37 alone using a variety of secondary structure prediction algorithms did not yield consistent results.33 However, when we used the neural net-based Jnet algorithm46 (available through the Jpred site at jura.ebi.ac.uk:8888) to analyze the human, mouse, and opossum Arf sequences simultaneously, two short b-strands are predicted within the N-terminal 37 amino acids (Figure 4(a)), between residues 4-12 and 20-27, respectively. The Jnet approach, which is based on the principle that secondary structure is conserved within evolutionarily related proteins, has been shown to predict secondary structure with 73 % or higher accuracy. In contrast to mArfN37, Hdm2 210-304 is highly acidic (17/95 Asp and 14/95 Glu, 31/95 total, or 33 %; the predicted pI is 3.5) and very hydrophilic due additionally to its high Ser content (17/95). Interestingly, as for the Arf N terminus, two short segments of b-strand are predicted by Jnet within the Arf-binding domain of Hdm2, between residues 245-253 and 275-282 (Figure 4(b)). Many residues within the b-strands are also predicted to be

mArfN37:Hdm2 210-304 (or mArfN37:Hdm2 210275) molar ratios that produce maximal b-strand secondary structure based on ellipticity at 200 nm using CD, resonances cannot be observed for the isotope-labeled component of Arf/Hdm2 mixtures. Further, the NMR spectra are consistent with slow exchange between the free and bound states. These results indicate that b-strand secondary structure forms when mArfN37 and Hdm2 210-304 (and Hdm2 210275) interact and that this secondary structure exists in the context of supramolecular assemblies that can be described as b networks. Characterization of Arf:Hdm2 assemblies As discussed above, the addition of mArfN37 to Hdm2 210-304 results in the formation of supramolecular assemblies comprised of b-strands. Stepwise addition of sub-stoichiometric amounts of mArfN37 to Hdm2 210-304 increased b-strand secondary structure content as judged by the change in ellipticity at 200 nm using CD (Figure 6(a)). We monitored ellipticity at 200 nm because the largest difference in ellipticity between random and bstrand conformations was observed at this wavelength. The binding of mArfN37 to Hdm2 210-304 is saturable. Similar results were obtained when mArfN37 was mixed with the shorter fragment of Hdm2, Hdm2 210-275. Further, saturable binding is also observed when the Hdm2 fragments were added to an excess of mArfN37. These ®ndings indicate that there are a limited number of binding sites for mArfN37 within Hdm2 210-304 and that discreet structures (containing b-strands) form when mArfN37 and Hdm2 210-304 (or 210-275) are mixed. For mArfN37 added to Hdm2 210-204, the plot of ellipticity versus amount of protein added (Figure 6(a), inset) is linear, indicating that each molecule of mArfN37 added binds completely to the Hdm2 fragment. Similar behavior is observed when mArfN37 binds Hdm2 210-275. These ®ndings suggest that the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the interactions is less than the concentrations used ($5 Â 10À6 M). This is a qualitative conclusion, however, because the molecular structure of these assemblies is not yet known. We observed formation of mArfN37:Hdm2 210304 (and mArfN37:Hdm2 210-275) assemblies under a variety of conditions, including pH values between 4 and 10, and salt concentrations from 0 to 2 M NaCl. Further, the assemblies were not disrupted by chemical denaturation (4 M urea), treatment with an organic solvent (50 % acetonitrile, vol:vol), or treatment with a mild detergent (10 mM CHAPSO). These results suggest that the mArfN37:Hdm2 210-304 assemblies are thermodynamically stable. This conclusion is supported by the results of CD experiments performed at elevated temperatures. The assembly formed by adding mArfN37 to an excess of Hdm2 210-304 to a ®nal molar ratio of 2:1 (mArfN37:Hdm2 210-304)

Second, NMR resonances for 15NmArfN37 or 15N-Hdm2 210-304 (and 15N-Hdm2 210-275) are broadened beyond detection when an unlabeled form of the appropriate binding partner is added to the solution (Figure 5(b)).

269 Dual binding motifs in Arf and Hdm2 mediate intermolecular interactions The N-terminal domains of human and mouse Arf have similar primary structure (Figure 4(a)) and contain an arginine-rich, repeated motif (Figure 7);33 we term this the ``Arf motif'' and label the ®rst and second repeats ``A1`` and ``A2``, respectively. Importantly, mArfN37, which contains both of the Arf motifs in mouse Arf, has been shown to possess biological properties comparable to full-length mouse Arf. These properties include nucleolar localization, the ability to sequester Mdm2 and Hdm2 in nucleoli and the ability to cause cell cycle arrest.32,33 Further, a construct containing residues 1-20 of human Arf has been shown to activate p53 in cells.28 The existence of two structural motifs within mArfN37 was suggested on the basis of the solution structure of mArfN37 determined in the presence of tri¯uoroethanol (TFE) using NMR spectroscopy.33 In TFE, mArfN37 is bi-helical, with the two Arf motifs contained by helices that are 12 amino acid residues in length. Based on the observation that b-strands form when mArfN37 and Hdm2 210-304 interact, and the prediction of b-strands within the interacting segments, the bi-helical conformation of mArfN37 in TFE is probably not relevant to the Hdm2-bound conformation. However, the observation of similar structure for the mouse A1 and A2 segments in mArfN37 did suggested that the two Arf motifs function in Hdm2 binding in a structurally similar manner. With these ideas in mind, we investigated the role the two Arf motifs play in Hdm2 binding by monitoring the binding of short peptides derived from human and mouse Arf to Hdm2 fragments using SPR and CD. Two libraries of peptides 15 amino acid residues in length were synthesized based on the sequence of exon 1b of mouse p19Arf and the entire sequence

in the absence of NaCl is stable up to $70  C (Figure 6(b), triangles). As the temperature is increased further, insoluble aggregates form, possibly due to denaturation of the b-strand-containing supramolecular assemblies. This thermal response curve was ®t to a sigmoidal function to determine the apparent melting temperature (tm), de®ned as the midpoint, which is 77  C. Similar experiments were performed at 150 and 300 mM NaCl and yield apparent tm values of 65 and 52  C, respectively (Figure 6(b), squares and circles, respectively). Similar apparent tm values were obtained with the assembly formed by adding mArfN37 to Hdm2 210-275.

270 of human p14Arf. The sequence for the ®rst peptide in each library corresponded to the ®rst 15 amino acid residues of the protein sequences. The N terminus for the second peptide was shifted forward ®ve residues to position 6 and spanned residues 620, and each subsequent peptide had an additional ®ve-residue forward shift of the N terminus. This approach yielded two libraries of overlapping peptides spanning mouse p19Arf residues 1-64 and human p14Arf residues 1-132. The ability of these peptides to bind Hdm2 fragments was determined using SPR. His af®nity tagged Hdm2 210-304 was immobilized on the surface of a C-1 chip through capture by a covalently cross-linked anti-His antibody. Library peptides were allowed to ¯ow over the Hdm2 surface, or over a control surface lacking an Hdm2 fragment. Relative binding af®nity was judged on the basis of the maximal SPR signal detected after binding for ten minutes. This unusually long inject time was used because some peptides exhibited slow association kinetics and allowed weak binding peptides to be identi®ed. The peptides that exhibited the largest relative binding af®nity map to the N termini of mouse and human Arf (Figure 8(a) and (b)); however, the length of the Hdm2-binding segment for the two is slightly different. For example, the ®rst four peptides from the human library bind Hdm2 210-304; these span the segment of human p14Arf that encloses the two Arf motifs. In contrast, six of the ®rst seven peptides of the mouse p19Arf library bind Hdm2 210-304. The ®rst ®ve of these enclose the two Arf motifs while the last, spanning residues 31-45, lacks elements of an Arf motif but contains the RRPR motif that is the NoLS for mouse Arf. One additional human Arf peptide binds Hdm2 210-304; this spans residues 86-100 and contains the NoLS (with the sequence RRPR) for human Arf. A similar approach using short synthetic peptides and SPR was used to map the segments of Hdm2 that bind mArfN37 (Figure 8(c)). Peptides within two segments of the central region of Hdm2 bind with relatively high af®nity to mArfN37, including those spanning residues 235-259 and 275-289. We refer to the ®rst of these as Arf-binding segment ``H1`` and the second as segment ``H2``. The peptide containing residues 290-304 exhibits modest af®nity for mArfN37; however, based on results discussed later we believe this is due to non-speci®c electrostatic forces. To investigate the roles of individual Arf motifs (A1 and A2) and Arf-binding segments of Hdm2 (H1 and H2) in the interactions between Arf and Hdm2 we monitored the binding of peptides containing these small segments (A1, A2, H1, or H2) to larger protein fragments of the corresponding binding partner (mArfN37 or Hdm2 210-304) using our CD-based binding assay. Peptides corresponding to the mouse Arf motifs, A1 (1-14) and A2 (1630), bind independently to Hdm2 210-304 and induce the transition from random conformations to b-strand secondary structure. Similarly, peptides

containing the human Arf motifs, A1 (1-14) and A2 (16-30), bind Hdm2 210-304 and produce the random-to-b-strand structure transition. Peptides from the Hdm2 library that were positive for mArfN37 binding on the basis of SPR (i.e. those within H1 and H2) were mixed with mArfN37 and binding was monitored in the same manner. Three peptides from the H1 segment and one from the H2 segment of Hdm2 induce b-strand secondary structure when mixed with mArfN37 (Figure 4(c)). These experiments indicate that peptides containing A1, A2, H1 or H2 can interact with larger fragments of the target protein and that the interactions also occur through the formation of b-sheet secondary structure. Peptides lacking A1, A2, H1 or H2 failed to induce the structural transition. Importantly, however, further reduction in the size of the interacting species led to a loss of Arf/Hdm2 binding as judged by a failure to induce structure in CD titration experiments. For example, while peptides derived from the A1 or A2 segments of Arf bind

271 is a frequent event in the development of cancer.1 These factors provide strong motivation to understand this pathway at the molecular level. Here, we have focused on understanding the molecular basis of Arf and Hdm2 interactions and their relationship to biological function. Previously, work from our laboratory and others had localized the domains mediating Arf and Hdm2 interactions to the N-terminal 37 amino acid residues of p19Arf 30,32 and the central acidic domain of Hdm2 (210-304).32 Structural analysis of mArfN37 in solution showed that this domain is dynamically disordered in the unbound state.33 Interestingly, we have shown here that the Arf interacting domain of Hdm2 is also dynamically disordered in solution. Importantly, we have shown that disordered Arf and Hdm2 domains bind to each other in both in vitro and cellular assays, demonstrating the relevance of the disordered states to biological function. The importance of dynamically disordered proteins or domains in biological systems, and in particular in the regulation of cell division, is well established.45,47 ± 49 For example, the N-terminal domains of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p2145,50 and p27 (Filippov & R.W.K., unpublished results) are largely unstructured prior to binding of their cellular targets. Currently, the functional advantage(s) of the ``folding-on-binding'' mechanism is not well understood. Intuitively, the loss of conformational entropy associated with folding will reduce the Gibbs free energy of binding for dynamically disordered proteins binding their targets.45,51 It has been suggested that the advantage of this mechanism is to enhance speci®city51 and/or to allow multiple, structurally distinct substrates to be bound.45,52 A recent computational study focused on the impact of conformational entropy in protein folding53 suggests that the entropy penalty may not be as great as commonly envisioned due to steric restrictions by amino acid side-chains on the vastness of polypeptide conformational space. The signi®cance of our observations with the Arf:Hdm2 system is that, in contrast to previous observations of the folding-onbinding phenomenon involving a single disordered protein, both components of the Arf:Hdm2 system undergo folding-on-binding. b-Strands form when dynamically disordered segments of Arf and Hdm2 interact. The formation of b-stand secondary structure is accompanied by the cooperative assembly of large supramolecular structures. We believe that Arf:Hdm2 complexes are formed by the cooperative assembly of like structural units into extended b-networks. This is supported by the appearance of the thermal response curves for the mArfN37:Hdm2 210-304 assembly, which are suggestive of thermally induced, cooperative unfolding54 (Figure 6(b)). The thermal transitions are not reversible, however, due to the formation of insoluble protein aggregates. Electrostatic forces likely stabilize the

Hdm2 210-304, they fail to bind short peptides (15 amino acid residues in length) derived from the H1 or H2 segments of Hdm2. Similarly, while peptides derived from the H1 or H2 segments of Hdm2 bind mArfN37, they fail to bind peptides derived from the A1 or A2 segments of mouse or human Arf. Further, mixtures of two, three, or four different peptides that contain the important binding segments (A1, A2, H1, and H2) fail to interact. Apparently, cooperative interactions between covalently linked binding segments from one protein (A1 and A2 of Arf, or H1 and H2 of Hdm2) are minimally required for Arf/Hdm2 interactions. Arf/Hdm2 interactions mediate nucleolar colocalization Microinjection and live cell imaging were used to determine whether the Hdm2 domains that were shown to bind Arf in our SPR and CD binding studies bound to Arf in cells and whether these domains are sequestered within nucleoli by Arf. Hdm2 deletion constructs tagged with a ¯uorescent label (Texas Red2) were microinjected into the nucleus of NIH 3T3 cells. Importantly, the NIH 3T3 cell line used lacks the gene for Arf. Nuclear microinjection was used because the Hdm2 constructs containing the central Arf-binding domain lack the nuclear localization signal found between residues 181-186. Arf was delivered to cells prior to microinjection by transfection with a plasmid expressing GFP-p19Arf. Texas Red2-labeled Hdm2 deletion constructs containing residues 210-275, 210-304, 277-350 and 277-491 were individually injected into cells in the absence or presence of the GFP-p19Arf fusion protein. In cells that did not express Arf, all constructs were localized in the nucleoplasm (Figure 2(c), (f), (i) and (l)) and appeared to be excluded from nucleoli. In contrast, when GFP-Arf was expressed, three of these constructs that contain all or portions of the central, Arf-binding domain exhibited a distinct nucleolar localization pattern (Figure 2, center and right-hand panels). For example, Hdm2 210275, 210-304 and 277-491 all displayed nucleolar localization when Arf was expressed (Figure 2(e), (h) and (n), respectively). Hdm2 277-350 also binds GFP-Arf, but causes the complex to be localized in the nucleoplasm rather than in nucleoli (Figure 2(j) and (k)). These results are consistent with our previous report32 showing that Hdm2 constructs that contain a segment spanning residues 210-304 bind Arf and are sequestered within nucleoli. The use of live cell imaging also allowed the kinetics of localization to be monitored. Within ®ve minutes after injection of Hdm2 constructs, complex relocalization was complete.

Discussion
Arf, Hdm2, and p53 play a central role in the biological pathway that maintains genomic integrity in human cells and disruption of this pathway

272 b-assemblies as shown by the salt-dependence of the apparent tm values. We have identi®ed two segments of similar sequence in mouse and human Arf, the consensus for which we term the Arf motif, that mediate binding to the central acidic domain of Hdm2 and that, individually, induce the formation of b-strands when mixed with the central, acidic domain of Hdm2. Further, peptides derived from the Arf-binding segments of Hdm2, termed H1 and H2, induce b-strands when mixed with mArfN37. These results suggest that cooperative assembly of b-strands minimally requires two binding elements of one protein (Arf or Hdm2) and one element of the other. An exception to this is the interaction of Hdm2 210-275, which we described as containing only the H1-binding segment, with short peptides containing either the human or mouse A1 segment. Hdm2 210-275 may contain a portion of the H2 segment that participates in cooperative interactions with its own H1 segment and the A1 segments of the peptides. Does the A1 segment of Arf cross-react with the H1 and H2 segments of Hdm2 and, similarly, does A2 cross-react with H2 and H1? Peptides from the human and mouse A1 and A2 segments of Arf induce b-strand assembly when mixed with Hdm2 210-304. In contrast, peptides from the human and mouse A2 segment of Arf fail to induce b-strand assembly with Hdm2 210-275 but do induce b-strand assembly with Hdm2 210-304. These ®ndings strongly suggest that the H2-binding segment interacts only with the A2 segment of Arf. Similarly, H1 may selectively interact with A1 but, based on our data, we cannot rule out the possibility that A1 also interacts with H2. At this time, it is dif®cult to con®dently rank the relative importance of the various modes of Arf:Hdm2 interaction (i.e. A1-H1, A2-H2, and A1H2) with regard to biological function. However, deletion of the A1 segment of mouse Arf uniformly eliminated the ability to arrest cell division.32 Secondly, Midgley et al.28 have shown that a GFP fusion protein linked to the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of human Arf (Figure 4) produces Arf-like biological effects in cellular assays. This result has been con®rmed by Llanos et al.29 using both N and C-terminal fusions of residues 2-29 of human Arf to GFP. With regard to Hdm2, the absolute conservation of amino acids within H1 from humans and mice to zebra ®sh and tree frogs (Figure 4) suggests that this segment is important for biological function. The A1 segment of Arf and H1 of Hdm2 may play dominant biological roles; these interactions, however, may not be strong enough to support high af®nity interactions and may be assisted by interactions between the A2 segment of Arf and H2 of Hdm2 in the formation of Arf:Hdm2 assemblies in cells. As further evidence that isolated domains from Arf and Hdm2 are functionally competent, microinjection and live cell imaging experiments demonstrate that the domains of Hdm2 we have

Molecular Basis of Arf and Hdm2 Interactions

characterized in vitro retain the ability to interact with Arf in vivo. The Hdm2 constructs 210-304 and 210-275 contain two (H1 and H2) and one (H1 only) of the Hdm2 binding segments, respectively. After nuclear microinjection, each of these constructs was re-localized to the nucleolus in the presence of GRP-p19Arf. Since the Hdm2 NoLS has been deleted from both of these constructs, the p19Arf NoLS signal must be driving the nucleolar localization for both proteins. In contrast, the Hdm2 construct 277-350 relocalizes Arf to the nucleoplasm. This result con®rms the presence of an Arf-binding motif in Hdm2 beyond amino acid 277 and shows that, upon binding of Hdm2 277350 to GFP-p19Arf, the Arf NoLS becomes inaccessible to the localization machinery. This result is consistent with localization experiments performed using full length Hdm2.31,32 Localization of Hdm2 277-491 to nucleoli only in the presence of p19Arf demonstrates that the mechanism for exposure of the cryptic Hdm2 NoLS is operative even in the absence of residues 1-176 of Hdm2. These biological results are consistent with the existence of two Arf-binding segments within the 210-350 segment of Hdm2, as identi®ed through in vitro assays using short peptides and protein fragments. A more direct demonstration of the biological importance of the H1 and H2 segments of Hdm2 in mediating interactions with Arf and Arf function would involve experiments with Hdm2 in which the H1 and/or H2 segments are deleted, and these experiments are in progress. Further, peptides containing the H1 and H2 segments of Hdm2 may serve as competitive inhibitors of Arf/Hdm2 interactions and inhibit Arf function in cellular assays. However, peptides microinjected into the nuclei of NIH 3T3 cells are degraded within a few hours and this time-scale is too short for the peptides to produce a biological effect (data not shown). A novel mechanism of protein-protein interaction mediates Arf:Hdm2 binding. The strict requirement for the presence of both proteins, Arf and Hdm2, for the formation of b-strand-containing assemblies differentiates this system from others that utilize the folding-on-binding mechanism. Further, while the Arf:Hdm2 system is similar to amyloid proteins in that they form extended networks comprised of b-strands, the individual components of the Arf:Hdm2 system fail to form bassemblies alone under a wide range of solution conditions. Insight into the two-component, folding-on-binding phenomenon can be gained by considering the unusual amino acid composition of the interacting segments of Arf and Hdm2. As previously reported, the N termini of both human and mouse Arf are unusually rich in basic residues.33 We have previously suggested that electrostatic repulsion between these Arg residues causes the polypeptide to be dynamically disordered. Interestingly, the Arf-binding segments of Hdm2 identi®ed here (H1 and H2) are rich in acidic residues. The carboxylate groups of these acidic residues probably interact with the guanidinium groups of

Molecular Basis of Arf and Hdm2 Interactions

273 Knowing that the RING domain of Hdm2 (and Mdm2) plays an important role in p53 ubiquitination, nuclear export and degradation,26,56 ± 59 we propose that when Arf binds the central, acidic domain of Hdm2 it not only exposes a cryptic NoLS within the Hdm2 RING domain but also alters the structure and function of this domain in the context of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The RING domain of Hdm2 may play a role in ``orienting'' the E2/E3 complex that targets p53 as seen in the UbcH7/Cbl E2/E3 complex.60 The binding of Arf to Hdm2 may alter the conformation of the Hdm2 RING domain to expose the cryptic NoLS and to inhibit the orienting function of the RING domain. It is possible that intramolecular interaction between the domains of Hdm2 hide the cryptic NoLS and maintain the RING domain in an active E3 ubiquitin ligase conformation. Arf binding, through the interactions described here, may disrupt inter-domain interactions, revealing the cryptic NoLS and inhibiting E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53. We have identi®ed small segments of Arf and Hdm2 that mediate binding and that may play a role in regulating Hdm2's destroyer function toward p53. If the latter is true, it may be possible to inhibit p53 destruction by disrupting inter-domain interactions within Hdm2 with molecules that mimic Arf function. The Arf motif is relatively small, and may be mimicked by yet smaller molecules. Similarly, the molecular targets of this motif, the H1 and H2 segments of Hdm2, are small. These ®ndings should provide incentive to search for small molecules that bind Hdm2 in a manner that mimics Arf, and that may produce biological effects similar to those produced by Arf. Since many human cancers are characterized by Arf loss while p53 is maintained in wild-type form,1 these suggestions may have wide-ranging implications in the treatment of cancer in humans.

Arg residues within the A1 and A2 segments of Arf via electrostatic interactions. The ability of salt to reduce the apparent tm value for the mArfN37:Hdm2 210-304 assembly (Figure 6(b)) strongly supports the idea that electrostatic interactions stabilize Arf:Hdm2 assemblies. Interestingly, b-strand conformations are predicted within the segments of Arf and Hdm2 shown to be important for molecular interactions (Figure 4). Thus, the sequences within these segments (A1 and A2, and H1 and H2) are consistent with extended, b-strand conformations. However, the high frequency of like-charged residues may cause the individual polypeptides to be dynamically disordered. It is also possible that the b-strand regions of f, c conformational space are populated within the H1 and H2 segments and that our methods of analysis (CD and NMR) have failed to detect them. In addition to electrostatic interactions, Arf:Hdm2 interactions are likely to be mediated by hydrophobic interactions. The Arg residues of the Arf motif (Figure 7) are separated by a string of hydrophobic residues, including a highly conserved segment with the sequence FLV. In an extended conformation, the arrangement of Arg and hydrophobic residues within the Arf motif would give rise to both types of residues (hydrophobic and Arg) on both faces of a b-pleated sheet. In the H1 segment of Hdm2, acidic residues and hydrophobic residues alternate within the sequence (Figure 4). This situation would allow acidic residues of Hdm2 to interact with Arg residues of Arf in the context of b-strands composed of intermingled A1 (or A2) and H1 segments. Hydrophobic residues of H1 would align, on the opposite face, with hydrophobic residues of the Arf motif. While speculative, our hypothesis that both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces stabilize Arf:Hdm2 b-assemblies is consistent with their high degree of stability, as exempli®ed by resistance to denaturation by urea, detergent, salt and extremes of pH. How these in vitro observations relate to Arf/ Hdm2 interaction within cells is unknown at this time, but it would appear reasonable that these highly stable structures would be favored within the cellular environment as well as in vitro. It is of interest that the nucleolus, where Arf and Hdm2 are localized, was originally characterized by its granular and ®brillar nature55 that is, in principle, consistent with the extended structures reported here for Arf and Hdm2. The biological function of Hdm2 is, in part, to maintain p53 at low levels by actively controlling its ubiquitination, nuclear export and proteosome-dependent degradation. Hdm2 is a modular protein with domains that mediate p53 binding N-terminal helical domain),19 Arf binding (acidic domain studied here), and p53 ubiquitination (C-terminal RING domain).26,56 Lohrum et al.31 have shown that when Arf binds Hdm2, the NoLS of Arf is hidden and a cryptic NoLS within the RING domain of Hdm2 is revealed, leading to nucleolar colocalization.31

Materials and Methods
Hdm2 and p19Arf protein purification Fragments of Hdm2 corresponding to residues 210275 and 210-304 (termed Hdm2 210-275 and Hdm2 210304) were subcloned into the expression plasmid pET28a (Novagen) using standard methods; pET28a allows expression of polypeptides with a thrombin-cleavable poly(His)af®nity puri®cation tag. Following protein expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Inc.), bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation followed by resuspension in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 500 mM NaCl at 4  C, and lysed by sonication. Urea was added to a ®nal concentration of 6 M to the soluble fraction after centrifugation (20,000 g, 20 minutes). Soluble, His-tagged proteins were puri®ed using Ni2-af®nity chromatography (Chelating-Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) in the presence of 6 M urea using otherwise standard procedures (Novagen, Inc.). An Nterminal fragment of mouse p19Arf corresponding to resi-

274
dues 1-37 (mArfN37) was puri®ed in a similar manner, as reported.33 His tag-cleaved mArfN37 was further puri®ed using C4 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (C4 column; Vydac, Inc.) using a 0.1 % tri¯uoroacetic acid (TFA)/acetonitrile buffer system. Lyophilized proteins were directly dissolved in the appropriate buffer for each experiment, as described below. Fractions containing Hdm2 proteins were dialyzed into 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl and treated with thrombin (Novagen) using 1 unit/mg protein at room temperature for 16 hours to cleave the His tag. Constructs were further puri®ed using anion exchange chromatography (Q Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) using 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0 with elution using a 50 mM-1.0 M NaCl gradient over 0.05 l.

Molecular Basis of Arf and Hdm2 Interactions NMR spectroscopy Uniformly 15N-labeled Hdm2 210-275 and 210-304 were prepared using standard procedures.45 Samples were concentrated by ultra-®ltration using a 3000 Da cutoff ®lter (Millipore, Corp., Centricon 3) to 1-2 mM in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 5 % 2 H2O (vol:vol) and placed in 5 mm micro-cell NMR tubes (Shegimi, Inc.). All NMR spectra were acquired using a 600 MHz Varian Inova NMR spectrometer (Varian Associates, Inc.) ®tted with a 5 mm triple resonance probe equipped with x,y,z axis pulsed magnetic ®eld gradients. 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra61,62 were acquired using standard procedures provided in the Varian Protein Pack pulse sequence library. 1H-15N steady-state {1H}-15N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) values were determined as the ratio of peak intensities in 2D 1H-15N correlation spectra with and without 1H saturation.63 Circular dichroism Spectra were recorded at 25  C using an Aviv Model 62A DS circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (Aviv Instruments, Inc.) equipped with a thermoelectric temperature control unit. All samples were prepared in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 at 0.02-0.2 mM as determined by amino acid analysis. Additional experiments have been performed in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer and water, with similar results (data not shown). Spectra were recorded using 1 mm quartz cuvettes and reported spectra are the average of ten scans over the range 195260 nm in 1 nm steps. Thermal denaturation experiments were performed in 10 mm quartz cuvettes with active stirring. The signal at 216 nm (b strand minimum) was used to monitor structural changes and the signal was averaged over 15 seconds. The sample temperature was increased in 1 deg. C steps. Fluorescent labeling Proteins for ¯uorescence microimaging studies were covalently modi®ed using an amine-reactive, sulfosuccinimidyl ester of Texas Red2 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Cat. # C-1171). In brief, puri®ed Hdm2-derived proteins were dialyzed into 100 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) at 2-4 mg/ml. The Texas Red2 dye was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at 10 mg/ml. Protein and dye 3:1 (vol:vol) were reacted for one hour at room temperature followed by puri®cation using size-exclusion chromatography (NAP 5 G-25 columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). Labeled protein bands migrated more slowly than unlabeled protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels consistent with the covalent attachment of dye. Cell culture and microinjection NIH 3T3 ArfÀ/Àcells passage 10-15 were cultured in Dulbecco's modi®ed Eagle's medium (DMEM; GibcoInvitrogen, Inc.), 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37  C, 7 % CO2. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, cells were plated on 35 mm dishes coated with poly-D-Lysine (Mattek, Corp.) at a density of 3 Â 104 cells per dish. Cells were transfected with a pcDNA plasmid (Invitrogen) containing the GFP-p19ARF fusion protein using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Inc.) in media according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer.

Peptide synthesis Peptides were synthesized using standard methods by an Advanced Chemtech 396 synthesizer. The peptide amides were synthesized on HMP-amide resin (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and the FMOC-amino acids were coupled using HOBt/HBTU chemistries. N-terminal acetylation was performed using acetic anhydride and HOBt. Peptides were cleaved from the resin in 91 % TFA containing 2 % phenol, 2 % ethanedithiol and 5 % thioanisole. The peptides were precipitated and washed twice with diethyl ether. Peptide concentrations for CD and SPR were determined using quantitative amino acid analysis.

Surface plasmon resonance Binding studies were performed using a Biacore 3000 surface plasmon resonance instrument (Biacore, Inc.). A Tetra-His2 Antibody (Qiagen, Inc.; Cat. #34670) was covalently attached to a carboxymethylated gold surface (C-1 chip; Biacore, Inc.). The carboxymethyl groups on the surface were activated with N-ethyl-NH -(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and the antibody was covalently linked at pH 7.4 in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl (PBS). Reactive sites remaining on the surface were blocked by reaction with ethanolamine. The His-tagged ligand was bound to the antibody by injecting a 5-10 mg/ml solution of the ligand in 10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS-N buffer, Biacore) at a ¯ow rate of 10 ml/minute through the ¯ow cell. A reference cell was prepared similarly except that no His-tagged ligand was added. Binding was measured by ¯owing the non-His-tagged analyte through the reference and ligand-containing ¯ow cells in sequence. Prior to injection of ligands, the chip surfaces were equilibrated in HBS-N buffer. Changes in the SPR response due to solvent differences and the injection process were monitored by injection of HBS-N buffer alone. Regeneration of the chip surface to remove bound analyte and ligand was accomplished by two 100 ml injections of 10 mM glycine (pH 2.0) through both ¯ow cells. Data reported is the difference in SPR signal between the ¯ow cell containing analyte and the reference cell. Duplicate injections were made and the SPR response values reported are the average of these two injections.

Molecular Basis of Arf and Hdm2 Interactions Sixteen hours post-transfection, the transfection media was refreshed with DMEM, 10 % FBS and the cells were allowed to recover for four hours. GFP-Arf positive cells were then located and co-injected with Texas Redlabeled Hdm2 polypeptides (2 mg/ml in 20 mM TrisHCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) using a Micromanipulator 5171/Transjector 5246 (Eppendorf, AG) in media supplemented with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2 to buffer cell media during injection and imaging. Representative cells were imaged over time. An Axiovert 135 TV inverted ¯uorescence microscope with an automated stage controller (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and circulating water bath heater (Fisher) was used for both microinjection and imaging. Images were acquired with a Zeiss 40Â NA  1.30 oil objective and MicroMax CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Inc.) operated with MetaMorph Version 4.01 imaging software.
