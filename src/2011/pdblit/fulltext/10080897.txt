A preliminary analysis is presented of whether the isotropic temperature factors derived from refinement of the tetragonal crystal structure of hen egg-white lysozyme at 2 A resolution can be interpreted in terms of molecular motion. If the contributions to the temperature factors from experimental errors, crystal disorder and imperfections of the molecular model are neglected, the apparent thermal motion is found to be compatible with the pair of molecules that have the strongest interactions in the crystal either moving as a rigid-body with libration about a common axis, or vibrating in an intramolecular mode with the principal amplitudes radial to this axis. There is only weak evidence for hingebending, i.e. that the two lobes of lysozyme vibrate so that their separation varies. Side-chains that are exposed to the solvent and some segments of the main polypeptide chain (including residues 70-73, 82-84, 101-103) have greater apparent thermal motion than the remainder of the molecule. Although this analysis at a single temperature cannot est,ablish whether thermal motion or static disorder (including conformational variability) underlies t,he observed effects, it suggests that the accurate determination of temperature factors will be useful in detailed studies of the dynamic properties of macromolecules.

1. Introduction
There is growing interest in the dynamic properties of protein molecules and the possibility that intramolecular motions play a part in their biological activities (e.g. Blumenfeld, 1976; Ikegami, 1977; McCammon et al., 1977) while, at the same time, there appears to be a widespread belief, especially amongst proponents of different methods, that X-ray crystallography is capable of revealing the static structures of protein molecules but little or no information about their dynamic behaviour. Crystallographic studies are well known, however, to provide detailed information not only about the thermal motion of small molecules as rigid bodies within crystal lattices but also about their intramolecular vibrations (e.g. Willis & Pryor, 1975) and it is timely and important, therefore, to consider to what extent similar information may be obtained for macromolecules. We present here a preliminary analysis of the apparent thermal motion of hen egg-white lysozyme (Blake et al., 1965) as shown

from the crystal structure refinement that is now in progress (D. E. P. D. C. Phillips, unpublished data). The immediate aim of the analysis was whether the thermal parameters indicated by the refinement are physically ful andit is important. therefore, tfo consider first, what effects might contribute

Grace 6 to decide meaningt,o them.

2. Apparent Thermal Motion in Crystals
(a) Thermal vibrations In general two types of thermal vibrations in molecular crystals can be distinguished, the acoustic or external modes which involve the concerted movements of neighbouring molecules and the optic or internal modes which involve intramolecular vibrations (Scheringer, 1972). In relatively small molecules the atoms are connected together mainly by covalent bonds whereas the molecules are linked in the crystal lattice by relatively weak interactions, e.g. van der Waals' forces and hydrogen bonds. Consequently the thermal vibrations in such crystals correspond mainly to motion of the molecules as rigid bodies and intramolecular vibrations are of relatively little importance. As Scheringer (1972) h as shown, however, the intramolecular modes make a larger contribution as the number of atoms in the molecules increases. His analysis (equation (19)) gives an estimate of the mean-square amplitude of intramolecular vibration of carbon atoms in the lysozyme crystal as 0.2 A2, which is similar to the observed values. Further work is needed to establish that Scheringer's analysis, applicable to small molecules such as anthracene, can be extended to proteins whose conformations largely depend on weak interactions of the kind that also hold together the molecules in the crystal. There is, however, considerable other evidence, both experimental and theoretical, of intramolecular motion in proteins (see McCammon et al., 1977 and references therein). Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of hen egg-white lysozyme (Campbell et al.. 1975; Dobson, 1977) and on cytochrome c (Dobson et al., 1975) in solution have defined some of these motions. Tyrosine and phenylalanine side-chains flip by 180" about their C@--CY bond which requires that the neighbouring regions of the molecule must move. External side-chains, e.g. lysines and arginines, undergo a rapid waving motion. There is also evidence to show that, the protein structure of lysozyme expands when the temperature is increased. Perhaps, even at constant temperature the molecule is undergoing a vibrational expansion and contraction. Recently, McCammon et al. (1977) have studied the dynamic motion of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor by energy calculations and found a root-mean-square displacement for all the nonhydrogen atoms of 0.9 A, the Ca atoms generally moving less than the side-chain atoms beyond Co. We have, therefore, considered internal and external modes of thermal motion of the entire molecule and, following the usual practice in studies of small molecules, we have attempted to derive information about these lattice motions of the molecules from the apparent motions of their constituent atoms, as revealed by a conventional X-ray refinement of the isotropic atomic temperature factors (see Refinement of Hen Egg-white Lysozyme). In this refinement each atomic contribution to an individual structure factor is multiplied by a factor exp(--B sin28/X2), where 0 is the Bragg angle of reflexion, h the X-ray wavelength and B a constant to be determined, ideally for each atom. This procedure must. be mentioned here because it is based upon the assumption that each atom is engaged in harmonic motion in a quadratic

potential well. If this assumption is valid then the constant B is related directly to P, the mean-square amplitude of vibration of the atom, by the equation B = 8rr2 V'. In practice, however, the atomic motion is known to be more complex than this even in small molecules and it seems certain that anharmonic motions must occur in protein molecules where the atoms and groups of atoms have markedly asymmetric environments. Dawson (1967) and Johnson (1969) have shown how temperature factors can be formulated to allow for anharmonic motion of the atoms in a crystal but their met,hods have not yet been applied to the study of proteins. (b) Static disorder and conformational

variability

A second fundamental difficulty is that apparent thermal parameters obtained by conventional X-ray analysis include also the effects of static disorder within the crystals. The thermal vibrations of the atoms, which have a frequency of about 1013 s-`, are slow compared with the X-ray frequency which is about 10's s-l. Consequently. t,o t,he X-rays the atoms appear t$o be stationary but displaced from their mean positions. But such displacements may be due not only to thermal motion but also to static disorder (sometimes known as frozen heat motion) if corresponding atoms in different unit cells throughout the crystal take up slightly different mean positions. In a protein crystal such disordering may arise because corresponding molecules in different unit cells adopt different positions or orientations (due, e.g. to the inclusion of impurities) but it may arise also because individual molecules take up different conformations. Provided that the resultant atomic displacements are less than the nominal resolution achieved in the electron density map their effect in a study at one temperature will be indistinguishable from the effects of true thermal motion (e.g. Dunitz, 1978). In practice, however, matters are more complicated. It has been well known since the earliest studies on myoglobin (e.g. Kendrew et al., 1961) that individual side-chains may take up radically different conformations in different, molecules so that separate images of them can be seen in an eleotron density map. Such conformational variability, which in some structures extends to more extensive regions than individual side-chains (e.g. Weber et al., 1978), cannot be modelled adequately by allocating to each atom a single position and an apparent amplitude of vibrat,ion. It is necessary rather to refine the atomic positions, apparent amplitudes of vibration and occupancies corresponding to each dist,inguishable conformation in the way that has now been achieved for some side-chains in the refinement of the insulin structure (D. M. Hodgkin, personal communication). Clearly the identification of each member of a range of alternative conformations is very difficult if the atomic positions overlap and the complete description of a molecule in which the atoms move within and between complex potential wells presents a considerable challenge. Nomenclature In t#he present refinement of the structure of lysozyme the apparent thermal parameters certainly include undefined contributions from static disorder and conformational variability in addition to true thermal motion. Accordingly, in the following account, we use quotation marks when using terms such as "motion" and "mobility" to emphasize the fact that the apparent variations in atomic positions may arise from vibrations, static disorder, conformational variability or combinations of all three.

(c) Effect of experimental

error8

Consideration of relatively simple structures has amply demonstrated that errors in the observed structure amplitudes have a more serious effect upon derived thermal parameters than upon atomic positions. Systematic errors, such as those arising from absorption of the X-rays within the crystal or its mounting have particularly serious effects which are difficult to distinguish from those of structural "mobility". By the careful use of modern methods of intensity measurement and correction, many convincing analyses of thermal motion have now been made (e.g. Schomaker & Trueblood, 1968) but the experimental data used in protein structure analysis are generally less satisfactory from this point of view since absorption errors (e.g. Nort'h et al., 1968) and the effects of irradiation damage (e.g. Blake & Phillips, 1962) are more difficult to correct and lead to precisely the kind of systematic variations in structure amplitudes that are taken up in apparent temperature factors. A demonstration that information of value can be obtained from studies of "motion" in protein crystals might well lead to a renewed interest in improving experimenhal methods. In the meantime, the situation is similar to that obtaining generally some years ago when Lonsdale & Milledge (1961) recommended that. structures should be refined against two or more independent sets of experimental data, preferably at different temperatures. The application of this approach is discussed further, below. Our justilication in continuing with the present analysis despite these reservations was provided by the interest of the topic, the need to develop methods of analysis and Dhe hope that the physical sense of the results might provide:some indication of their validity. (d) Imperfections of the molecular model

Finally it must be noted that failure adequately to describe the electron density will lead to systematic effects in t,he apparent, thermal parameters. Thus the small electron densities due to bonding electrons will be taken up in this way and, probably more seriously, the density due to hydrogen atoms that have not been included in the refinement will also affect the apparent temperature factors--especially when individual atoms are not resolved. These dangers point to the need for analyses to be carried out at high resolution when hydrogen at'oms may be resolved and Oreated as they have been in the low-temperature study of insulin at 1.2 A individually, resolution by Sasaki et al. (1978).

3. Refinement of the Hen Egg-white Lysozyme structure
Hen egg-white lysozyme is a monomeric protein with a polypeptide chain of 129 amino acid residues crosslinked by four disulphide bridges. It crystallizes in a number of crystal forms under various conditions (Imoto et al., 1972) and the structure considered here is tetragonal with eight molecules in general positions in a unit cell of a = b = 79.1 A, c = 37.9 A. space group P4,2,2 (Blake et al., 1965). The atomic co-ordinates, before refinement, and the co-ordinate system used in this paper have been reported by Imoto et al. (1972). The X-ray intensities (Blake et al., 1965) were measured by means of the linear diffractometer (Arndt & Phillips, 1961) adapted to measure three reflections at once (Arndt et al., 1964). Radiation damage was minimized by limiting the exposure of each crystal to 20 hours or less and absorption errors, which were small because of the choice of approximately isometric crystals, were corrected by the method of North

et ab. (1968) who refer to this work in their paper. Banyard (1973) has shown that these corrections were applied inappropriately t'o reflections in upper levels corresponding to reciprocal lattice points near the rotation axis but Ohis defect did not seriously affect the quality of the data. Measurements were made from crystals mounted about their ]llO] and ]lOO] axes and sets of int,ensities showing poor agreement during the merging process were replaced by new ones from a fresh crystal (North et al.. 1968). The description of the molecular structure was first, refined by Diamond (1974) using his method of real-space refinement (Diamond, 1971). The atomic positions were adjusted, subject to stereochemical constraints, so as to opt,imize the tit of t'hc molecular model t#o the origina. &&on-density map derived by the method of muhiplt: isomorphous replacement (Blake et al., 1965). At' t,his st,age some 80 wat(`r molecules had also been located in the crysbal st'ructure. Subsequent refinement (D. E. I'. &act, & D. C. Phillips, unpublished dat'a) has proceeded by t,he difference synt'hesis method (Cochran. 1951). The phases (CL,) of t,hc st,ructure fact'ors (F) were calculated for the current model of the structure ant1 used to calculate a difference synthesis with coefficients (Fobs -. Fcalc)exp ir,. Corrections t,o the atomic positions were derived from these syntheses (and from directly calculated gradients in difference densit,y atI the atomic positions). In addition. water molecules not previously included in the calculations were located in these difference syntheses, and in related maps of the t'ot'al electron densit'y, so that some 350 water molecules to each molecule of protein were included in stages as the rrfimment proceeded. The apparent' vibrational "motion" of the atoms was taken into account by thtl application of isotropic temperature fact'ors. Unfort,unately, however. t'he present refinement at, 2 .j resolution is limit'ed by the relatively small number of experimental observations upon which it is based in relation to the number of parameters required t#o describe the structure. The experimental data comprise 9600 structure amplitudes (when t'he addit'ional data used to det,ermine the phases by the method of isomorphous rrplactment are discarded) and the unknowns are the positions and vibraGons of some 1000 atoms in the protein (discounting hpdrogen) and 400 water molecules (or salt ions). We are therefore concerned to determine about 3 x 1400 = 4200 positional parameters and if we include individual t,emperaturc factors for each at,om this number increases to 5600. Consideration of variable occupancies for t,he water molecules and alternative conformat'ions for parts of t,hr protein, both of which are necessary, increases t,he number even further. In effect this number is reduced to some extent by the use of constraint,s to preserve the st'ereorhemist,ry of tho moltcular model but,, in order t,o reduce still furt#her t#hc number of independent variables while preserving a good description of t,hr structure: only two isot,ropic t,emperat,urrt fact'ors were used to describe the apparent thermal nrotion of t,he atoms in eactr amino acid residue. The first was applied to the atoms in the main polypeptide chain (K, Cu. C'. 0) and to Co when present, and the second temperature factor was used for all side-chain atoms beyond 0. The equivalent mean-square amplitudes of vibration are denot'ed a2 and Jvz, respectively. The refinement is not yet complete and in the present analysis \ve have considered t,he two most recent sets of thermal parameters. Set I was derived from a difference synthesis calculated when the agreement between observed and calculated structurt: amplitudes was R' = ~IIFobsI - lF~alcl(/~JFobs( -= 025 and set II was derived when I?' had falhm to 0.22, mainly as a result of including about 156 additional water

of the values of p'" for each type of side-chain. In general, there is a large range of lvz values for any side-chain type and this, together with the limited number of residues and the correlaOion between p'" values and exposure to solvent, makes it difficult to interpret the values for the means as an indication of which side-chain types are most "mobile".

This linear relationship is consistent with a first-approximation model of the molecule "vibration" of mean-square amplitude "moving" as a rigid body with a kanslational (rotational vibration) about axes through the 0.13 A2 and uniform "libration" centroid. Alternatively it may be the result of intramolecular "motion", for example, a periodic expansion and contraction in which atoms furthest from the centroid "move" most.

"motion"

The structure of lysozyme can be considered very roughly as 2 separate globular lobes which are separated by a cleft and which are connected by a few short sections of the polypeptide chain. This structure suggests a possible mode of intramolecular "motion", hinge-bending, in which the two lobes "move" relative to eacll other so that their separatiolr, i.e. the size of the cleft \-aries. The short, connecting sections of ctlain act as a tlingt: for t,he 2 lobes. McCammon et al. (I 975) llavr solved the equation of motion for t,llis mode and found a root'-mean-square amplit,ude of rotat,ion about tllc hinge for each lobe of 1.6". mode of intra,molocular "motion" is modelled by a "libration" of a The hinge-bending residue about, the appropriate instantaneous axis (see Appendix).

The first Two different (hinge A used in model 4) corresponds closely to t,he model of McCammon et al.

In this model, the hinge passes roughly through the centre of mass of the molecule (perpendicular distance = 2 A) and each instantaneous axis passes rough13 the centre of mass of the corresponding lobe. In the second (hinge B used in through model 5) the hinge was formed from the line connecting residue 38 to 87 and was 9 !L from ttle molecular centroid. Kesidues 1 to 3 and 39 to 87 formed lobe 1. The angle between hinge A and hinge l3 is about 60'. Other tha.n the consideration of 2 hinges and the corresponding assignment of residues to the lobes, no attempt was made to determine tho best Ilinge axis or the best division of the molecule into 2 lobes. For each model, the \-alue of the hinge parameter (1,2) was found by a least-squares fit to the observed n2 values. (cl) Jlodels

It is instructive also to consider a model based on intramolecular "motion" which might be supposed distinct from those considered above. There is some evidence (see Apparent Thermal Motion in Crystals) that the molecules may be subject to expansion "motion" can be considered by an analysis similar to and cont,raction. This breathing that of Schomaker & Trueblood (1968). The instantaneous displacement of an atom at, i (; = 1, 2 or 3) is given by, position r (=:- VI, rl, rg) from the centroid in the direction

If this equation is compared "motion", and the coefficients

Thus one would get the same fit to the observed a2 values as from equation (7). This analysis shows how the results from the rigid-body model also could be interpreted as intramolecular "motions". For example, if the molecule were "moving" along the z axis, all the E-terms except Es3 would be zero ; the rigid-body analysis would suggest 2 principal axes of libration of equal magnitude, Lll and L,,, and the remaining L-terms would be zero.

6. Results
(a) Main-chain "motion" The best parameters describing all of these models for the apparent thermal motion of lysozyme were determined by linear least-squares fit to the 129 values of C?,",, (the apparent mean-square amplitudes of vibration of the main-chain atoms). The quality of the fit given by each model are indicated by the values of A (equation (2)) and R2 (equation (3)) (Table 2). In any comparison of the values of A and R2 obtained from the alternative models the different numbers of adjustable parameters defining them must be taken into account. We have used the method of Hamilton (1965), see particularly his equation (13)t which tests the null hypothesis that the introduction of additional parameters into an existing model to give a more elaborate model does not give a significant reduction in the value of A. However, Ford & Rollett (1970) have shown that the

decrease in A (or R') is likely to be larger, and therefore seemingly more significant, in a least-squares analysis in which the correct weights have not been used. Since we have not yet included weights in our analysis we must note that it is appropriate to apply Hamilton's test more stringently than is usual, rejecting the null hypothesis only at a high level of significance. Tn order to obtain additional evidence on the significance of the results we have also repeated the calculation involving hinge-bending with the hinge direction in an unlikely position but) still within the molecule. The hinge axis used in models 5, 7 and 9 (i.e. hinge B) was normal to the plane of Figure ,41 (see Appendix) (i.e. parallel to the z't axis) and passed through a point xi, y,. The wrong hinge axis was also parallel to the Z' axis but passed through xi., y/,, where x1, = -xi and Yti = YC. The results of using the "wrong" hinge are included in Table 2. Application of Hamilton's test shows clearly that each elaboration of the straightforward model of rigid-body "motion'`-in the progression translational vibration (i.e. i2 = mean of o&), uniform libration + i2, TL rigid-body "motion", TLS to a highly significant (at the 0.1% level) improvement rigid-body "motion" -leads in the agreement between observed and calculated D2 values. The librational "motion" thus appears to be significantly non-uniform and, in addition, we may conclude that, t,he three axes of libration do not intersect at a point. The general breathing "motion" alone does not provide impressive agreement with experiment and when combined with translational vibration this model of intramolecular "motion" cannot be distinguished by the use of our present data, from Cruickshank's (19566) model of rigid-body "motion". This ambiguity is discussed further in the Discussion. Finally, our preliminary consideration of hinge-bending suggests that these modes do not provide good models for gross intramolecular "motion". For either hinge A or B, hinge-bending alone is clearly not a satisfactory model. Although when hingebending is combined with uniform translation it gives a significantly (O*l"/b) better fit than the mean of o2 (i.e. model 0), it does not give as good agreement with experiment than does the two-parameter model of uniform libration and translation. Furthermore, Hamilton's test shows that the addition of hinge-bending to the TLS rigid-body "motion" does not lead to a significant (at the 5% level) improvement in the fit to the observed o2 values. The inclusion of hinge-bending about a "wrong" axis (model 12) gave a value of A similar to those obtained from our two guesses at a suitable hinge (models 4 and 5). However the "wrong" hinge-bending combined with translation (model 13) gave a value of A somewhat higher than the values obtained with the two possible hinges (models 6 and 7). Clearly refinement of the hinge position is required before we can conclude that this mode of intramolecular vibration does not occur in the tetragonal crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme. The foregoing analysis of our resu1t.s suggests that the following models of the molecular "motion" merit detailed consideration : general (TLS) rigid-body "motion" ; TL rigid-body "motion"; and, as an example of alternative interpretations of the data,

Thus there is a preferred axis of libration with a mean-square magnitude of 6.9 deg2. The presence of this axis is suggested from Fig. 2 in which the Ca atoms that have values of o2 markedly lower than that given by the linear relationship with r2 lie very roughly on a line (-0.58, 058, -0.58) through the centroid of the molecule.

When the TLS model is applied to anisotropic B-values, there still remains an element of arbitrariness in the values of S and T and thus in the description of the motion.

Some residues (Table 3) had ( 7?2)ob8 greater than ( 02)calc + D (ADZ), which suggests "motion" in addition to that described by the rigid-body model (see Discussion). When the TLS model was calculated after excluding those residues (47, 70, 71, 73, 101, 102) for which o2 was greater than 0.45 AZ but with the original molecular centroid, the magnitude of the major axis of L was 1.4~ 10e3rad2 along (-0.85, 0.52, -0.13).

7. Discussion
(a) Apparent %aotio~~" This analysis of the observed o2 values suggests that the overall "motion" of the molecules in tetragonal lysozyme cryst,als is made up of a number of component'x which can be distinguished from one another but cannot be described unambiguously in physical t,erma. First, the molecules appear to be subject to translational vibrat'ions of mean-squaw amplitude 0.1 A". Second. the molecules appear t,o be subject to ,`motion" which is best described b? and model 2 (TLS "motion") but is also dell represented by model 3 (TL "motion") "mot'ion"). A breathing model equivalent to by the equivalent model 8 (breathing TLS rigid-body model could be developed. Model 2 gives a major libration of 6.9 deg2 about an axis with direction cosines (--O-74. 0.63, -0.23), a smaller lihration of 2.7 (leg2 about (0.66. 0.63, -0.41) am1 perhaps a minor libration of 0.3 deg2 about (0.1%. 0.45. 0.88). The libration axes come close to int,ersrcting at the molecular cent,roitl. Model 8, on t,he other hand, describes this second molecular motion in terms of an expansion and contraction of tshe molecule wit,h t'he "movement" of the atoms predominant,lg in the plane, defined by axes in the directions (0.60. 0.76, O-23) and (0.43. -0~08, -0.90). These axes are approximately normal t,o t'he major libration axis of the rigid-body model and intersect, at the molecular centroid. Clearly librational "motion" could be distinguished from breat,hing "motion" if dat,a were available describing the underlying anisotropic motion of t,he atoms. With wferenor to the major libration axis. the atomic "motion" must be predominant]! and t,angentia(l if librations are. radial if Itreat,hing "mot,ion " is the more important The third kind of "motion" investigated in t,his analysis is a hinge-bending relatiw of the t,wo principal domains making up the molecule. There was ver) "motion" lit,tltJ evidence for this "motion" but it clearly should be invest~igated further. There are several different interpret ations of the apparent molecular "motions" described above (see Apparent Thermal Motions in Crystals). The int'ermolecular "motion" could be t,rue rigid-body motion w&h the atom vibrating about, one equilihriurn position 01' it could he the result8 of different~ moleculrs adopting slightl! different po&ions and orientations in different, unit cells. Apparent int'ramolecular "mot8ions" could arise from intJramolecular vibrations about one mean conformation or the superposition of several differtwt conformations each subject] to smaller vihrations and with t,ransit,ions between tllenr. Tn this connection and with particulate rcfewncc to the hinge-bending mode? it, should be not& that studies of the interactions of lysozytne with various inhibitors have shown that conformational changes tending to a partial closing of the active-site cleft, occur in such complexes (Blake it al., 1967h).

Tsernoglou (unpublished data) have concluded from a study of t#he apparent thwrnal vibrations in crystals of sperm whale metmyoglobin at different temperatures t'hat the apparent motion arises mainly from the molecule adopting a large number of slight.ly different. conformations.

for by the models for the general "motion" of the molecule described (eit#her TLS 01 TL rigid-body "motion" or a general breathing and translation). For most of the residues listed, this result' suggests immediately that various sections of the moleculr have additional "mobility". In part,icular, residues 70> 71 and 73 are part of the loop 67 to 73 which is exposed to solvent in the isolated molecule and which is known to change its mean conformation when inhibitors arc bound to the enzyme (Imoto et nb., 1972). Similarly residues 82, 83, 84 and 101, 102, 103 form parts of exposed loops and several of the other residues (18, 47. 61. and 121) seem susceptible to additional "motion" since they do not form main-chain hydrogen bonds (Imoto et (lb., 1972) and are, in general, exposed to solvent. The remaining residues (3, 88. 92, and 99) are part of regular secondary structures and, particularly for residues 92 and 93 which are iu the middle of an a-helix. it seems less likely that these residues have markedly greater "motion" than that of t#he neighbouring regions. Clearly additional evidcncc is needed t'o confirm and extend these promising indications of dehailrd intramolecular "motion".

that can be considered to form a lysozyme "dime? in t'he tetragonal crystals (see also Blake et al. (196i'a) and Imoto et al. (1972) for the evidence suggesting that this is not the dimer observed in solution at high pH). First, there may be a joint libration of the two molecules about the common axis. Alternatively, there may be internal breathing "motions" that are predominantly radial to this axis, w-ith residues furthest from the axis suffering the largest displacement~s. It, must remain for the moment, an of the two molecules is brought open question whether t,his apparent joint "motion" about, by their associat'ion or whet,her t,he association is favoured by the inherent, It may be, however, t'hat the hinge-bending mode, for which molecular "motion". t#here was pract,ically no evidence, is inhibited in these crystals by t,he association ot the molecules into dimers and the way in which the dimers are packed together.

Although we have only been able to consider very roughly the effect of crystal packing on the solvent accessibility of the side-chains, t)here is 330/6 (v/v) water in t'bc tetragonal crystals (Imoto et al.. 1972) and therefore one would expect that most of t,he side-chains exposed to solvent in the isolated molecule are accessible to water in the crystal. The results suggest the physically sensible conclusion that, in general. than those that, art' the side-chains that are exposed tZend t,o have greater "motion" buried. (c) Efects of errora We must note that the molecular axis that appears to be associated with the rigidbody or general breathing "motions" is very closely coincident with the axis about which the crystals were rotated when most of the intensity measurements were made. There must be some suspicion, therefore, that the effects arise from systematic errors in the data. As we have noted above (Refinement of the Hen Egg-white Lysozyn~ Structure). however, the crystals have tetragonal symmetry (so that there is also an equivalent crystal axis perpendicular t'o the rotation axis) and the structure amplit,udrs used in the analysis were averages over several symmetry-equivalent reflections measured under different conditions (i.e. in different reciprocal lattice levels and at different' reciprocal lattice distances from the rotation axis). Accordingly we believed analysis of the apparent thermal motion to be worthwhile despite the danger of thcl results being confused by the effects of errors in the data. This optimistic approach has been justified further by the recent finding (P. J. Artymiuk, C. C. F. Blake & S. .J. Oatley, pereonel communication) that the temperature factors obtained b? refinement of the structure of human lysozyme (in completely unrelated crystals) at 1.5 .I resolution are closely similar to those reported here for tetragonal hen eggwhite lysozymr. Furt.hermore. similar results were obtained from the set' I and set II. values of (72 and wZ which suggests that the temperature fact,ors are not simply an artifact that t'c`snlt?: from thn particular cycle of refinement.

so that their structures can be refined in different crystal environments and hy tht use of independent sets of experimental data. Comparison of the structure of hen egg-white lysozyme reported here withthat refinedinthetricliniccrystals (Kurachietal., 1976) may help to resolve the effects of crystal packing and identify significant intramolecular "motions". Similarly, parallel studies of proteins isolated from different, species may reveal "motions" that are conserved and, hence, probably important to the biologicalact,ivity. A preliminary comparison of the present results on hen egg-white lysozyme in tetragonal crystals with the refined structure of human leukemic lysozymr in orthorhombic crystals (P. ,J. Artymiuk. C. C. F. Blake 85 S. ,J. Oatley, unpublished work) suggests that the molecular motions of bhese selected molecules are closely similar and include common intramolecular mot'ions of particular molecular segments. A promising method for analgsing such segmented motion, which depends upon a simple elaboration of equation (4). has been suggested by Dunitz & White (1973). Such comparative studies will also illuminate the vexed question of the effect,s of crystal environment on molecular conformation and mobility. "motjion" and t'he resolution of rigid-body The detailed analysis of intramolecular would be advanced by the availability of anisotropic and breathing "motions" If adequate care is taken over measuretemperature factors for individual atoms. ment of the S-ray intensities and their correction for irradiation damage and absorption, it now seems certain that least-squares refinement of the atomic parameters in which account is taken directly of the constraints imposed by invariant molecular paramet,ers (Konnert, 1976; Mr. A. Hendrickson & G. A. P&&o, personal communication) will allow t'he determination of isotropic B-values for individual atoms even at, 2 ,% resolution. At l-5 A resolut'ion the 22&X)0 intensities potentially available for refinement of the tetragonal hen ogg-whit,e lysozyme structure, combined with molecular constraint,s. might well permit estimation of anisotropic t,emperature factors. Although it would not, be possible to distinguish between true thermal motion and the various types of static disorder in analyses of this kind at a single temperature. studies of the same structure at different t.emperatures may make this possible. The development of low-temperature methods in pr&ein crystallography (e.g. Alber et al.. 1976) has enhanced the potential of this approach which is being vigorouslv developed by H. Frauenfelder, G. A. Petsko & D. Tsernoglou (unpublished data). Finally it, may be noted that different approaches may also be useful. An analysis of the thermal diffuse scattering of X-rays (e.g. Willis & Pryor, 1975) by protein crystals might provide evidence, for example, of dominant librat'ion axes, although it would not distinguish between static disorder and libration. Independent evidence could be obtained from the inelastic scattering of neutrons (e.g. Cochran, 1973 ; Whit)e, 1975). 13Thcn these prospcct,s for further work are t,aken int'o account it seems clear that' X-ray analysis is capable of providing detailed dynamic information about the conformations of biological macromolecules that) would be valuable, for example, in leading towards a deeper understanding of enzyme action. ~r~resting and detailing the use of instantaneous We thank a referee (K.

In the hinge-bending model of intramolecular "motion" the two lobes of the lysozyme molecule "move" relative to each other so that their separation varies (see sections 4 and 6 of the main text). If any intermolecular and solvent effects are negligible, then there will be no net force on the molecule. Thus the centre of mass of the molecule will remain stationary whilst the centres of mass of the two lobes can only "move" (in anti-phase) along the line connecting them (Fig. Al). For each lobe.

FIG. Al. The location of t,he instantaneous axes in the hinge-bonding mode. C, . C', . C', are, I'(`spectively, the centres of mass of the molecule, lobe 1 and lobe 2. H is the hinge position and & IS the locus of its motion. I, and Iz are the instantaneous axes for lobe 1 and lobe 2, respectively. Given C, and C, (i.cb. the y axis) The distances C,C,, C,H, C,C,, C,H me rlr dI, r2, d,, respect,ively. the z axis is chosen so as to minimize the angle between the hinge axis and the z axis. The diagram is drawn to scale for hinge B (see section 6(b), main t,ext). The co-ordinates for C,, C,, H, I, and I2 8.9), (~~1.6, --8.2); fo1 are, respectively: for hinge A (0.0, 8.9), (0.0, --8.2), (1.75, -0.2), (-1.9, 6.9). The direction cosines of hinge hinge B (0.0, 10.2), (0.0, -6.9), (14.1, ll.l), (14.7, 10.2). (5.9. A are (0.0, 0.21, 0.98) and of hinge B are (0.0, 0.31, 0.95).

the atoms will "rotate" about a stationary line: the instantaneous axis (see Synge & Griffith, 1959). The positions of the two axes (one for each lobe) are identified as follows.

Let t,he centre of mass of the molecule be C, and choose this as the origin. Let CT1 and C, be the centres of mass of the two lobes and in the plane of the paper and let -C&, be the positive y axis. Let the hinge H be at (z,y) assumed normal to the paper. (If H is not normal to the paper, then not even its direction is constant.) Let the distances yl, r2. d, and d, be as shown in Figure Al, then for the given model d, and d, are con&ants and rl and y2 must be replaced by mrl and mr,. where m is a timedependent scalar of mean value unity, whose fluctuations express the flexing of t,he hinge. We can then solve for x and y from : (!/ -- mr1)2 + x2 = a,2

The inst,antaneous centres are then on the line through H normal to L and on the lines through the centroids normal to their motions, i.e. at I, and I,. The co-ordinates of I, and I, are (X,, rl) and (X,, - r2) with
