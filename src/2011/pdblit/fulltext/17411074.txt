ABSTRACT: To determine the significance of the 2 calcium-binding site in fibrin polymerization, we synthesized the fibrinogen variant, D298,301A. We expected these two alanine substitutions to prevent calcium binding in the 2 site. We examined the influence of calcium on the polymerization of D298,301A fibrinogen, evaluated its plasmin susceptibility, and solved 2.7 and 2.4 Å crystal structures of the variant with the peptide ligands Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide (GPRP) and Gly-His-Arg-Pro-amide (GHRP), respectively. We found that thrombin-catalyzed polymerization of D298,301A fibrinogen was modestly impaired, whereas batroxobin-catalyzed polymerization was significantly impaired relative to normal fibrinogen. Notably, the influence of calcium on polymerization was the same for the variant and for normal fibrinogen. Fibrinogen D298,301A was more susceptible to plasmin proteolysis in the presence of GPRP. This finding suggests structural changes in the near-by "a" polymerization site. Comparisons of the structures revealed minor conformational changes in the 294-301 loop that are likely responsible for the weakened "a" site. When considered altogether, the data suggest that the 2 calcium-binding site does not significantly modulate polymerization. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the weakened "a" polymerization site masks an important role for the 2 calcium-binding site in normal polymerization. Somewhat unexpectedly, the structure data showed that GPRP bound to the "b" site and induced the same local conformational changes as GHRP to this site. This structure shows that "A:b" interactions can occur and suggests that these may participate in normal polymerization.

Fibrinogen, a 340 kDa plasma glycoprotein, plays a key role in blood clotting. The fibrinogen molecule exists as a dimer, and each subunit of the molecule consists of three nonidentical polypeptide chains, AR, B , and . A total of 29 disulfide bonds link the 6 polypeptide chains together, forming an elongated trinodular molecule with structurally distinct regions (1, 2). Generally, fibrinogen's structure can be described as a central E nodule linked to two terminal D nodules by way of coiled-coil connectors (3). The amino termini of all six polypeptide chains form the E nodule. Each set of three chains extends out from the E nodule forming the coiled-coil connectors; ultimately the B - and -chains fold independently into the - and -modules in the D nodule of the molecule. Within the D nodules, the AR-chains reverse course, folding back along a section of the coiled-coil region and then extend freely in solution or interact noncovalently with the E nodule (4).

The conversion of soluble fibrinogen into an insoluble fibrin clot is initiated by the serine protease thrombin. Thrombin cleaves four fibrinopeptides from the amino termini of the AR- and B -chains of fibrinogen. Fibrinopeptide A (FpA1) cleavage exposes the N-terminal sequence of the R-chains, GPRV, whereas fibrinopeptide B (FpB) cleavage uncovers the N-terminal sequence of the -chains, GHRP. These new N-terminal residues, called the "A" and "B" knobs, respectively, interact with complementary polymerization pockets, called "a" and "b", located in the and -modules, respectively (5, 6). The "A:a" and "B:b" interactions occur between fibrin molecules allowing them to spontaneously polymerize into an insoluble fibrin clot. The current model of polymerization describes the process in two distinct steps, protofibril formation and lateral

294-301 Loop Influences the Integrity of the "a" Site aggregation. When FpA is cleaved, the subsequent "A:a" interactions between fibrin molecules result in the formation of double-stranded, half-staggered protofibrils, in which two fibrin molecules in one strand are aligned end-to-end by their D nodules, both interacting with the E nodule of a fibrin molecule on the parallel strand (7, 8). Protofibrils grow in length by adding fibrin molecules to each strand. When protofibrils reach a critical size, they begin to associate in the process termed lateral aggregation. This leads to the formation of thick, branching fibrin fibers that form a network called a clot. Subsequent to protofibril formation, FpB is cleaved from fibrin, exposing the "B" polymerization sites, allowing presumed "B:b" interactions to occur. The removal of FpB enhances lateral aggregation; therefore, "B:b" interactions promote this step in polymerization (9, 10). Nevertheless, the fact remains that lateral aggregation can occur in the absence of FpB cleavage (8). Thus, other molecular interactions may drive lateral aggregation, but these remain ill defined. Calcium ions strongly influence fibrinogen function, enhancing polymerization, and modulating fibrinogen's susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes (11-13). Each D nodule of the fibrinogen molecule possesses four calcium-binding sites that have been identified by X-ray crystallography studies (14). Two of the calcium-binding sites reside in the -module and the other two in the -module. The 1 calcium-binding site is the high-affinity calcium-binding site, located in the 318-324 loop (15, 16). The 1 calciumbinding site comprises residues in loop 381-385 (17). The 1- and 1-sites are structurally similar because the - and -chain polypeptides are homologous. The 1-site differs from the 1-site in that it has three calcium-coordinating amino acid residues and one coordinating water molecule, whereas the 1-site has four calcium-coordinating amino acid residues. The remaining two calcium-binding sites are distinct. The 2 site comprises the side chains of residues B Asp261, B Asp398, and Glu132 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of B Asp263 (14, 18-20). The 2 calciumbinding site acts as an anchor between the -module and the coiled-coil connector. Our recent study showed that impairing calcium-binding to the 2 site resulted in increased lateral aggregation, implying that the 2 site modulates lateral aggregation (20). Others have suggested that the 2 site impacts the access to the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)binding site (21). The remaining calcium-binding site, 2, is located in the loop 294-301. This site was first identified in crystals where the peptide GHRP, which mimics the B-knob, was bound in the "a" polymerization pocket (14). Subsequently, calcium binding to this site was found in one of two conformations in the crystal structure of fragment D from the recombinant variant B D398A fibrinogen with GHRP bound in the "a" pocket (19, 20). The data strongly support the notion that this site is induced by molecularpacking interactions that exist in the crystal form, where the unit cell is a ) 55 Å, b ) 148 Å, c ) 230 Å, and R ) )  ) 90 °. It remains unclear whether the 2 calcium-binding site is unique to the protein crystal or whether it is present in solution fibrinogen or the fibrin polymer. Moreover, the functional relevance of this site has not been examined. To determine whether the 2 calcium-binding site contributes to fibrinogen function, we engineered a variant fibrinogen, D298,301A, that replaced two aspartic acid

We examined the influence of calcium on the polymerization of D298,301A fibrinogen, evaluated its plasmin susceptibility, and solved 2.7 and 2.4 Å crystal structures of the variant with the peptide ligands GPRP and GHRP, respectively. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Reagents. All chemicals were of reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless specified otherwise. Human R-thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN) and batroxobin (Batroxobin moojeni) was from CenterChem (Stamford, CT). Plasminogen was purified from human plasma by a method previously described (22). Streptokinase was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). The peptides, GHRP and GPRP, were synthesized as carboxy-amides by the Protein Sequence and Peptide Synthesis Facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Chapel Hill, NC). Cell culture medium with normal recombinant fibrinogen was obtained from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B resin was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Monoclonal antibody IF-1 was purchased from Kamiya Biomedical (Seattle, WA). Synthesis of D298,301A Fibrinogen. The expression vector, pMLP-, includes the cDNA of the human fibrinogen -chain and has been described previously (23). Aspartic acid residues at positions 298 and 301 were substituted with alanine residues by oligo-directed mutagenesis, using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto,CA)(24).Themutagenicprimerwas5GGCTTTGATTTTGGCGATGCTCCTAGTGCCAAGTTTTTCACATCC3. The mutated cDNA was sequenced to ensure that only the intended changes were made. Synthesis of D298,301A fibrinogen was carried out as described (25). Briefly, the altered pMLP- vector and the pMSV-His selection vector were cotransfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) expressing the AR- and B -polypeptide chains of human fibrinogen. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to screen single clones, and those expressing the most fibrinogen were used for large-scale protein expression. Protein production was performed in roller bottles using serum-free medium containing aprotinin. The medium was harvested periodically to collect the secreted fibrinogen. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added (0.1 mM) and the medium stored at -20 °C. Purification of Recombinant Fibrinogen. Both normal and D298,301A fibrinogens were purified from the medium by a two-step method outlined previously (26). Briefly, proteins were precipitated from the medium with ammonium sulfate, and fibrinogen was isolated from the precipitate by immunoaffinity chromatography with the calcium-dependent, fibrinogen-specific antibody, IF-1, eluting the bound protein with buffer containing 5 mM EDTA. Purified fibrinogen was dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl (HBS) with 1 mM CaCl2 followed by extensive dialysis against HBS. Aliquots of purified protein were stored at -70 °C. Reduced and nonreduced samples of the purified recombinant fibrinogens were subject to SDS-PAGE analysis to confirm purity and proper polypeptide chain composition of the protein.

5116 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 17, 2007 Fibrinopeptide Release. Fibrinopeptide release was measured as previously described (25, 27). Briefly, 0.1 mg/mL fibrinogen in HBS was treated with 0.005 U/mL human R-thrombin at ambient temperature. Reactions were stopped by boiling at specified time points, centrifuged, and the supernatants were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC to quantify the FpA and FpB released. The data were analyzed for statistical significance using an unpaired t-test. Values were considered significant for p < 0.05. Fibrinogen Polymerization. Thrombin- or batroxobincatalyzed polymerization of normal and D298,301A fibrinogen was monitored by measuring the rise in turbidity at 350 nm in a SpectraMax-340PC Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously (28). The polymerization reactions were carried out at ambient temperature in HBS buffer containing 0.01, 1, or 10 mM CaCl2. The chloride ion concentration was held constant in each reaction by adjusting the NaCl concentration. All fibrinogen samples were subject to overnight dialysis against HBS containing 0.01 mM CaCl2, and the final calcium concentration was adjusted 30 min before polymerization. Dilution of thrombin in HBS was done immediately before use. Reactions were initiated by adding 10 µL of enzyme (1 U/mL of thrombin or 1 BU/mL of batroxobin) with a multichannel pipetter to wells containing 90 µL of fibrinogen (0.2 mg/mL). Upon the addition of enzyme, the wells were mixed for 5 s using the automix function of the instrument, and the absorbance was read every 24 s for 3 h. A minimum of three experiments in duplicate were carried out for each calcium concentration. Polymerization data were assessed to determine the lag time, Vmax, and final absorbance (clot absorbance at 350 nm at 80 min) for each reaction as described previously (29) and compared to determine statistical significance using a t-test. A difference was considered significant for p < 0.05. Plasmin-Protection Assay. Plasmin was prepared by activating 100 µg/mL plasminogen with 100 U/mL streptokinase for 40 min at 37 °C. Normal recombinant and D298,301A fibrinogens (0.2 mg/mL) in HBS were digested by incubating with 10 µg/mL plasmin for 4 h at 37 °C. The digests were carried out under several conditions that included 0.01 mM or 0.1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM EDTA, or varying concentrations of the peptides GPRP or GHRP with 1 mM EDTA or CaCl2 present. The digest reactions were stopped by heating the sample at 100 °C for 5 min, and analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels, under non-reducing conditions. Preparation of Fragment D from D298,301A fibrinogen. Eight milligrams of D298,301A fibrinogen (final concentration of 0.61 mg/mL) in HBS with 20 mM CaCl2 was used to produce fragment D (rfD-D298,301A), as described previously (18). Briefly, the reaction was initiated by adding 100 µL of immobilized TPCK Trypsin (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Digestion at room temperature was carried out over a 4 day period, and the progress of the digest was monitored by SDS-PAGE. When only rfD-D298,301A and fragment E bands were visible by SDS-PAGE (data not shown), the digest was stopped by removing the trypsin-coated beads by filtering through a 0.22 µm syringe fitting filter (Costar, Corning, NY). The resulting digested protein was stored at -70 °C.

Kostelansky et al. Fragment D of D298,301A fibrinogen was purified by lectin affinity chromatography based on a method described by Solis et al. (30). Briefly, the entire amount (8 mg) of digested D298,301A fibrinogen was loaded onto a 4 mL Concanavalin A agarose affinity column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris at pH 7.4 and 1 M NaCl (loading buffer) at a flow rate of 10 mL/h. The column functioned by binding fragment E while allowing fragment D to flow through the column. The flowthrough was kept, and extensive washing with loading buffer was employed to recover fragment D. Unwanted fragment E was eluted from the column using loading buffer containing 0.1 M R-methyl-D-glucopyranoside. The flowthrough containing rfD-D298,301A was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris at pH 7.4 and concentrated with a centrifugal filter device (50 kDa MW cutoff, Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and stored at 4 °C. Crystallization of D298,301A Recombinant Fragment D. Crystals of rfD-D298,301A were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C in the presence of a peptide ligand, GPRP or GHRP. Conditions were screened close to those previously determined for other fibrinogen fragment D crystals (14-20). For rfD-D298,301A crystals, sitting drops containing 5 µL of 10 mg/mL protein in HBS with 3 mM GPRP or GHRP were mixed with an identical volume of well solution containing 50 mM Tris at pH 8.5, 2 mM NaN3, 12.5 mM CaCl2, and 11% PEG 3350. Seeding from crystals of normal rfD was employed to maximize the growth of the D298,301A fragment D crystals. Diffraction quality crystals grew in a few days time. Crystals were cryoprotected for low-temperature data collection by dipping in a solution containing the crystallant plus 20% glycerol. X-ray Data Collection. Diffraction data for the rfDD298,301A+GP crystal were collected at 100 K with a Rigaku RUH3R rotating anode generator with Osmic confocal blue multilayer optics and a Rigaku R-AXIS IV2+ detector at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The data for the rfD-D298,301A+GH crystal were collected at 100 K at the SER-CAT beamline 22-ID of the Advanced Photon Source. X-ray diffraction data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (31). Structure Determination. The unit cell dimensions of the rfD-D298,301A+GP and rfD-D298,301A+GH crystals (Table 1) were isomorphous to those of normal recombinant fragment D with GPRP and GHRP bound (rfD-BOTH, pdb code 1LTJ). Thus, rfD-D298,301A+GP and rfD-D298,301A+GH were refined by rigid-body minimization followed by simulated annealing using the 1LTJ structure as a starting model. Alanine residues were substituted for the aspartic acid residues at positions 298 and 301 in the starting model, and CNS (32) was utilized for the refinement. Before refinement, 5% of the observed data was set aside for cross-validation using the free R-factor statistic (33). After the initial round of refinement, manual fitting was performed on both structures using the software program O (34) and A-weighted |2Fo - Fc| and |Fo - Fc| electron density maps (35). After manual fitting, the structures were further refined using CNS. The refinement protocol used least-squares minimization, simulated annealing, and individual temperature factor refinement including an overall anisotropic B-factor and bulk solvent correction. Cycles of manual fitting and refinement were carried out while following the working R-factor and free R-factor statistics to evaluate the rebuilding

Statistical analysis utilizing an unpaired t-test showed that the specificity constants for FpA release were similar (p > 0.05), indicating that the variant fibrinogen is a normal thrombin substrate. In contrast, the specificity constants for FpB release were different (p < 0.05). Previous studies have shown that the kinetics of FpB release depend on the formation of protofibrils (36, 37); therefore, the slower release of FpB indicates that the protofibril formation of D298,301A fibrinogen is impaired. A kinetic model of fibrin polymerization shows that changes in the rate of protofibril growth do not affect the lag time measured by turbidity (38). We concluded that the slower release of FpB indicates that protofibril growth is impaired in this variant fibrinogen. Fibrin Polymerization. We examined the thrombincatalyzed polymerization of normal and D298,301A fibrinogen at 0.01, 1, and 10 mM CaCl2 by monitoring the change in turbidity at 350 nm and determining values for the lag time, Vmax, and final absorbance. The lag time corresponds to the rate of protofibril formation, whereas Vmax indicates the maximum rate of lateral aggregation, and final absorbance denotes the final fiber thickness. Representative polymerization curves are shown in Figure 1A, and the averaged parameters are summarized in Table 2. Although there were differences between the variant and normal polymerization profiles, these were modest. Only at 1 mM CaCl2 were all three parameters significantly different from the normal. Furthermore, the overall effect of calcium concentration was similar for the normal and the variant fibrinogens; polymerization was enhanced by increasing calcium concentration with a shorter lag time, a faster Vmax, and a higher final absorbance. Polymerization experiments were also performed with batroxobin, which cleaves only FpA. Representative data are shown in Figure 1B, and polymerization parameters are presented in Table 3. Batroxobin-catalyzed polymerization of D298,301A fibrinogen was impaired at all calcium concentrations, and most differences were statistically significant compared to the normal. The lag times were all about 2-fold longer than that of the normal. The Vmax values were reduced, although the magnitude of the differences varied with calcium concentration; at 0.01 mM CaCl2, Vmax for D298,301A was only 30% of that of the normal, whereas at 1 mM and 10 mM CaCl2, Vmax was about 60% of that of the normal. The final absorbance for D298,301A fibrinogen was lower than that for normal fibrinogen, although the magnitude of this difference varied with calcium concentration, the variant was 45% of that of the normal at 0.01 mM CaCl2, 70% at 1 mM CaCl2, and 80% at 10 mM CaCl2. Overall, increased calcium concentrations affected D298,301A polymerization, in a fashion similar to that of normal fibrinogen, by reducing lag time, increasing Vmax, and augmenting final absorbance. Thus, batroxobin-catalyzed polymerization of the variant was impaired relative to that of the normal but showed a calcium dependence that was similar to that of the normal. A comparison of thrombin-catalyzed to batroxobincatalyzed polymerization shows notable differences. With both enzymes at all calcium concentrations, the lag times

progress. In the final step of the modeling process, 150 and 239 water molecules were added to the structures of rfDD298,301A+GP and rfD-D298,301A+GH, respectively. In addition, cis peptide bonds were modeled at positions B 407 and 339. The working R-factor, 23.4%, and the free R-factor, 27.5%, for the rfD-D298,301A+GP structure dropped to 21.6% and 25.6%, respectively. Likewise, the working R-factor decreased from 23.9% to 22.0%, and the free R-factor dropped from 27.7% to 25.9% in the rfDD298,301A+GH structure after the appropriate changes were introduced. RESULTS Characterization of D298,301A Fibrinogen. We synthesized D298,301A fibrinogen in CHO cells and purified it from the cell culture medium as outlined in the Experimental Procedures section. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the variant protein assembled into a 340 kDa molecule similar to normal recombinant fibrinogen and consisted of the three expected polypeptide chains that compose fibrinogen (data not shown). As with other variant fibrinogens with altered Asp residues in the -chain, the -chain of D298,301A fibrinogen had an increased mobility relative to the -chain of normal fibrinogen. The gels also showed that the recombinant proteins were pure and homogeneous. Fibrinopeptide Release. We examined thrombin-catalyzed fibrinopeptide release for normal and D298,301A fibrinogens by measuring the percent of released fibrinopeptides at specific time points (data not shown). The specificity constant (kcat/Km, ( SD) for FpA was 6.6 ( 0.5 (×106M-1

for D298,301A fibrinogen were longer than that of the normal, but the magnitudes of these increases were quite different: 1.2- to 1.3-fold for thrombin and 1.8- to 2.6-fold for batroxobin. When comparing Vmax values with thrombin, there was little or no difference between the variant and the

normal. In contrast, Vmax values with batroxobin were different, in particular at the lowest calcium concentration, where the rate for the variant was about a third that of normal. The most obvious difference was seen in the final absorbance for D298,301A fibrinogen, as this was higher than that of the normal in thrombin-catalyzed reactions and lower than that of the normal in batroxobin-catalyzed reactions. These differences indicate that the release of FpB from D298,301A fibrinogen affected polymerization in a manner different from the release of FpB from normal fibrinogen. Plasmin Protection. To further characterize the "a" polymerization site of D298,301A fibrinogen, we performed plasmin protection assays. In this experiment, the addition of GPRP or calcium to the reaction limits the plasmin proteolysis of fibrinogen to fragment D1. In the presence of EDTA or in the absence of GPRP, fragment D1 is further cleaved to the smaller fragments D2 and D3. We found that plasmin proteolysis of D298,301A fibrinogen was not limited with 2 mM GPRP, a concentration that fully protected normal fibrinogen (data not shown). With increasing concentrations of GPRP, above 5 mM, limited cleavage of D298,301A was apparent, and even at the highest peptide concentration, that is, 20 mM, significant levels of fragments D2 and D3 remained (data not shown). To determine whether the addition of calcium with the peptide would increase plasmin protection, we examined the effect of adding calcium in the presence of 5 mM GPRP. The data are shown in Figure 2. For normal fibrinogen, plasmin protection was essentially complete at all calcium concentrations in the absence of the peptide such that the addition of the peptide had little or no consequence. In contrast, samples with 0.01 mM calcium in the absence of the peptide showed only partial protection in plasmin digests of D298,301A fibrinogen; here, the addition of the peptide increased protection, although in an incomplete manner. With higher calcium concentration, we observed increased protec-

tion that was further enhanced by the addition of 5 mM peptide. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that the two alanine substitutions altered both peptide binding to the "a" site and calcium binding. We also examined whether GHRP could induce protection from plasmin in normal or D298,301A fibrinogen. Under conditions of increasing concentrations of GHRP, up to 20 mM, the variant and normal fibrinogens both showed little protection from plasmin, with digest patterns similar to those seen with EDTA (data not shown). These data suggest that GHRP binding to the "b" site, or the "a" site, as indicated in the structure data described previously and herein, does not influence plasmin cleavage. Structure of rfD-D298,301A. We solved 2.7 and 2.4 Å X-ray crystal structures of fragment D of D298,301A in the presence of GPRP (rfD-D298,301A+GP) and GHRP (rfD-D298,301A+GH), respectively. We were not able to obtain crystals of the variant fragment in the absence of the peptide. The aspartic acid to alanine substitutions were clearly evident in electron density maps of both structures. When the rfD-D298,301A+GP structure is aligned by CR-atoms with the structure of the D fragment from normal recombinant fibrinogen crystallized in the presence of GPRP and GHRP (rfD-BOTH, 1LTJ), the RMSD ) 0.32 Å. Similarly, the CR-atom alignment of the rfD-D298,301A+GH with rfD-BOTH gives an RMSD of 0.26 Å. These low rmsd values demonstrate that the global structure of the D nodule of D298,301A is similar to normal fibrinogen. A detailed inspection of the rfD-D298,301A+GP and rfD-D298,301A+GH structures aligned with rfD-BOTH revealed subtle movement of the loop 294-301. In particular, the loop in rfD-D298,301+GP is obviously different from the loop in rfD-BOTH. As shown in Figure 3, the variant structures are well aligned with the normal at residues 293 and 302, but the loops connecting these residues differ. Figure 3B depicts a critical hydrogen bond between the CR backbone nitrogen of residue G296 and a side chain oxygen of residues D301. This hydrogen bond is found in the presence and absence of calcium in the 2 site. In D298,301A fibrinogen, the elimination of the aspartic acid side chain at position 301 removes the possibility of this hydrogen-bond interaction and results in the observed conformational flexibility of the 294-301 loop.

(A) The image was generated after aligning the CR atoms of rfD-D298,301A+GH (pink) and rfD-D298,301A+GP (blue) with normal rfD-BOTH (1LTJ, yellow). The RMSD from the alignment of rfD-D298,301A+GH with rfD-BOTH was 0.26 Å, whereas the RMSD of the rfD-D298,301A+GP/rfD-BOTH alignment was 0.32 Å. The green worm represents the approximate location of either GPRP or GHRP bound to the "a" polymerization site in the structures. Notice that the conformation of loop 294301 appears most altered in the  D298,301A+GP structure. (B) Depiction of a crucial hydrogen-bond interaction in loop 294301 of normal recombinant fibrinogen. The structure of normal rfDBOTH (1LTJ) is shown as a yellow worm, GPRP bound in the "a" polymerization site is shown as a green worm, and residues 296-301 are shown as sticks. Note the hydrogen-bond interaction between the side chain of D301 and the backbone nitrogen of G296 that is conserved with or without calcium bound in the 2 site in normal fibrinogen. This hydrogen bond is eliminated by the mutation to alanine.

In the rfD-D298,301A+GH structure, the peptide GHRP was present in both the "a" and "b" polymerization sites, as expected from previous structures of fibrinogen fragment D crystals grown in the presence of only GHRP (14, 20). The conformation of the peptide bound in the "a" polymerization site, however, was unexpected. Previously, GHRP bound in the "a" polymerization site has been seen in two crystal forms. In the form with unit cell dimensions of a ) 89 Å, b ) 94 Å, and c ) 227 Å, (Figure 4A) calcium is not present in the 2 site, whereas in the form with unit cell dimensions of a ) 55 Å, b ) 148 Å, and c ) 230 Å (Figure 4B), calcium is present in the 2 site. Comparing the structures of bound peptides in these two crystal forms shows that they differ in the orientation of the histidine side chain; it points toward the solvent in the first crystal form and into the pocket in the second. The rfD-D298,301A+GH structure showed the histidine side chain pointed into the pocket (Figure 4C) for both molecules in the asymmetric unit, even though this

FIGURE 5: Difference in electron density in the "b" polymerization site. The |Fo - Fc| electron density map was contoured at 3.0  for a model that excluded the presence of the peptide in the "b" polymerization site as well as the native positions for residues B E397 and B D398. The data demonstrate that GPRP is present in the "b" polymerization site with the concurrent flip of residues B E397 and B D398 toward the peptide. Although not shown here, the binding event eliminated the 2 calcium-binding site.

polymerization site with GHRP in rfD-BOTH. With GPRP binding to the "b" polymerization site, the side chains of residues B E397 and B D398 point toward the bound peptide interacting with the arginine side chain in the same manner as that seen with GHRP bound to this site. In addition, no calcium was present in the 2 site, and a salt link was seen between residues E132 and RK157. We conclude that under the conditions of crystallization, both GPRP and GHRP are able to bind in both polymerization pockets. DISCUSSION Our laboratory has used the analysis of engineered fibrinogen variants to further define the molecular mechanisms that mediate the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. We have recently focused on the role of the D-domain, where we can complement biochemical data with atomic resolution crystal structures. The data, especially the structural data, have proved invaluable in understanding the consequences of introducing engineered changes in fibrinogen. We have synthesized variants within polymerization sites "a", "b", and all four calcium-binding sites, 1, 2, 1, and 2. Here, we report an analysis of the variant fibrinogen, D298,301A, with substitutions introduced to disrupt calcium binding to the 2 site. Crystal structures of fragment D in the presence of either GPRP or GHRP showed that the two substituted alanine residues induced only local changes in the structure of the D-domain, limited to the 294-301 loop. Calcium was not present in the 2 site as expected for this crystal form with unit cell dimensions of a ) 89 Å, b ) 94 Å, and c ) 227 Å. Our results, therefore, do not address whether these substitutions would impair calcium binding to this site in the alternate crystal form, a ) 55 Å, b ) 148 Å, c ) 230 Å, and R ) )  ) 90 °, where the 2 site was identified (19, 20). Nevertheless, we propose that calcium binding to the 2 site is impaired in D298,301A fibrinogen because

crystal has unit cell dimensions of a ) 89 Å, b ) 94 Å, and c ) 227 Å and no calcium in the 2 site. We conclude that the subtle movement of the loop 294-301 is associated with a small increase in volume of the "a" polymerization site such that the histidine side chain is accommodated within the binding pocket even in this more common crystal form. In the rfD-D298,301A+GP structure, the peptide GPRP was bound not only in the "a" polymerization site, as expected, but also in the "b" polymerization site, as clearly shown in the difference electron density map (Figure 5). The structure of the "b" polymerization site with GPRP in rfDD298,301A+GP is in good agreement with that of the "b"

294-301 Loop Influences the Integrity of the "a" Site other variants with single substitutions at side chains critical to calcium coordination have impaired, if not eliminated, calcium binding to the 1 and 2 sites (19, 20, 39). The structures also showed that when either peptide is bound in the "b" polymerization site in rfD-D298,301A, the 2 calcium-binding site was not occupied. We interpret our biochemical data within the context of these structures, although they have been obtained at a calcium concentration (12.5 mM) that is higher than that used for the biochemical analyses. We found that thrombin-catalyzed polymerization of D298,301A fibrinogen differed modestly from normal polymerization. Nevertheless, the delayed release of FpB, which has been similarly observed for other variants with impaired protofibril formation, suggests that protofibril formation is indeed impaired. Of note, the small differences between the variant and normal polymerization were similar at all calcium concentrations, that is, the effect of calcium on the polymerization of the variant paralleled the effect of calcium on the polymerization of normal fibrinogen. This calcium effect contrasts markedly with the effect of calcium on the polymerization of the 2 site variant, E132A fibrinogen (19, 20). With E132A fibrinogen, the final absorbance was highest at the lowest calcium concentration and decreased with increasing calcium, exactly the opposite of the calcium dependence of final absorbance for normal fibrinogen. We concluded, and others concur, that the 2 calcium-binding site has a modulating role in polymerization (18, 20, 21). In contrast, the current data suggest that calcium binding to the 2 site has little or no role in normal polymerization. Because the mutations, which were intended to disrupt calcium binding to the 2 site, also altered the "a" polymerization site, we have not been able to independently assess the role of the 2 site. Unequivocal measurement of the role of the 2 site will require the examination of a fibrinogen variant where only 2 calcium binding is impaired. It is also noteworthy that the modestly impaired polymerization of D298,301A fibrinogen contrasts with the significantly impaired polymerization of variants with substitutions in single residues that coordinate calcium binding in the 1 site. These substitutions, D318A or D320A, severely impaired both protofibril formation and lateral aggregation. In comparison, the loss of the 2 calciumbinding site has a more subtle role in polymerization, likely due to subtle structural changes in the "a" polymerization site. We concluded that it is the loss of calcium binding at this site and the conformational flexibility of the 294-301 loop that caused the impaired polymerization. The plasmin protection experiments are consistent with the conclusion that the "a" polymerization site is altered. In the presence of EDTA, GPRP binding to D298,301A fibrinogen was markedly reduced. Moreover, the addition of calcium, even as low as 0.01 mM, enhanced GPRP binding. These results suggest that the polymerization of D298,301A is close to that of the normal because calcium binding to the 1 site facilitates "A:a" interactions. We believe that the calcium in the 1 site stabilizes the structure of this binding pocket. Furthermore, because the simultaneous substitutions of D298 and D301 to alanine modestly weakened the "A:a" interactions, the experiments did not measure the true contribution of the 2 site to polymerization.

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 17, 2007 5121 The comparison of thrombin-catalyzed to batroxobincatalyzed polymerizations further supports this conclusion. If the "A:a" interactions are weakened, then polymerization mediated by either enzyme should be close to that of the normal, as observed. Moreover, one would anticipate that batroxobin-catalyzed polymerization would be more impaired than thrombin-catalyzed polymerization because the weak "A:a" interactions would be more apparent without "B:b" interactions, as shown by our data. In the rfD-D298,301A+GP structure, we were surprised that the electron density maps revealed GPRP bound to the "b" polymerization site. This observation is contrary to previous crystallographic studies reporting GPRP bound exclusively to the "a" polymerization site (16). The structure of GPRP in the "b" polymerization site in the variant fragment D was quite analogous to GHRP bound to the "b" site of normal fragment D. The observation that GPRP can bind to both the "a" and "b" polymerization sites is consistent with earlier biochemical studies that suggested GPRP could bind to more than one distinct site (40, 41). We have also recently shown that the peptide GPRVVE, which is identical to the N-terminal sequence of the R-chain, can bind to both sites (42). The observation that "A:b" interactions can occur calls into question the model where only "A:a" interactions occur during thrombin- and batroxobin-catalyzed polymerization. The possibility that both "A:a" and "A:b" interactions occur upon the release of FpA may explain the observation that batroxobin-catalyzed polymerization proceeds quite normally. Perhaps "A:b" interactions, occurring intermittently, trigger the conformational changes usually brought about by "B:b" interactions. This possibility is supported by our recent studies with two variants with "b" site changes that prevented "B/b" interactions, B D398A and B E397A (19). Batroxobin-catalyzed polymerization of both B D398A and B E397A fibrinogens was impaired compared to that of normal recombinant fibrinogen. These biochemical data suggested that "A:b" interactions are part of batroxobincatalyzed polymerization. This suggestion is supported by the structure presented here, showing GPRP in the "b" site in rfD-D298,301A+GP, and the structure reported previously (42), with GPRVVE in the "b" site of normal fragment D (rfD-GPRVVE). Using similar reasoning, our data also indicate that "B:a" interactions are possible; therefore, the difference between batroxobin- and thrombin-catalyzed polymerization may arise from the addition of "B:a" interactions following the release of FpB. Further studies are clearly required to test these possibilities. The conformation of the GHRP peptide bound to the "a" polymerization site in the rfD-D298,301A+GH structure was unexpected. The unique conformation observed was first distinguished in a variant fibrinogen D fragment crystal, rfDB D398A+GH (pdb code 1RE3). In the 1RE3 structure, a unique conformation exists when GHRP is bound to the "a" polymerization site in an rfD molecule concurrent with calcium binding to the 2 site. In the rfD-D298,301A+GH structure, the crystal form is inconsistent with 1RE3, which would contain the packing-induced 2 site and altered GHRP conformation. As expected, the rfD-D298,301A+GH crystal data did not reveal calcium bound to the 2 site; however, both molecules of the asymmetric unit exhibited the altered GHRP conformation. This result is comprehensible after considering the substitution and the resulting conformational

FIGURE 6: Steric limitations dictate GHRP's conformation in the "a" polymerization site. The environment of residue 301 dictates the GHRP conformation because of the steric restraints that differ among the various structures. Shown is a top-down view of the "a" polymerization site with the -chain backbone colored in purple. The yellow D301 side chain in normal fibrinogen (rfD-BOTH; 1LTJ) resides 3.4 Å from the His of the bound peptide shown in green. Both the D301 side chain (blue) and GHRP (gray) alter their positions when the 2 calcium-binding site is occupied (as in rfD-B D398A+GH; 1RE3). The side chain of A301 in the rfDD298,301A+GH structure is shown in red; in this structure, the peptide conformation is equivalent to that seen in 1RE3 (gray). Note that when the D301 side chain from normal fibrinogen (yellow) is superimposed on the rfD-D298,301A+GH structure (gray), there is a steric clash between the D301 side chain and the His of GHRP (heavy dotted line), indicating the necessity of conformational flexibility in the peptide.

flexibility. The conformational flexibility of loop 294-301 and the replacement of alanine at position 301 both create more volume in the "a" polymerization site. The increased space provides the opportunity for GHRP to take on the alternate conformation that is presumed to be an energetically favorable conformation shown in Figure 6. By considering the point that steric concerns dictate the conformation of GHRP in the "a" polymerization site, we can infer the origin of the altered conformation concomitant with occupancy of the 2 site. When the 2 site is occupied by calcium, residue D301 moves from pointing into the "a" polymerization site to an alternate position facing the bound calcium (Figure 6). This movement removes the steric hindrance of D301 in the "a" site and allows the altered energetically favorable conformation. The replacement of D301 with the smaller alanine residue similarly removes this steric hindrance; therefore, the His side chain can point into the polymerization pocket. These interpretations are supported by a recent publication that showed that the peptide AHRP binds selectively in the "b" site because of steric limitations in the "a" site (43).
