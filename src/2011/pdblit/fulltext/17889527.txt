Blood coagulation is a complex multifaceted process that involves cellular and proteinaceous components.1 Through a series of ordered events, primary hemostasis caused by platelet aggregation is followed by activation of plasma coagulation factors causing clot formation in blood vessels (secondary hemostasis). The cascade of biochemical events leading to blood coagulation involves a stepwise activation of trypsin-like proteases. The multifunctional serine protease thrombin (Factor IIa)2 is responsible for the final cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin, which undergoes cross-linking to form a strong fibrin clot. Under normal physiological conditions, the blood coagulation system is balanced by anticoagulation on the one hand, and fibrinolysis on the other.3 A pathogenic imbalance that favors the activation of the coagulation system may lead to thrombosis in humans.4 Inhibition of thrombin is widely viewed as an effective therapeutic means to prevent the formation of blood clots and related thromboembolic disorders.5 In previous studies we have shown that chlorodysinosin A, a natural product belonging to the aeruginosin family6 exhibits low nanomolar in vitro inhibitory activity against thrombin, trypsin, and tissue factors VIIa and Xa (Fig. 1).7 An X-ray co-crystal structure of chlorodysinosin7 (and related aeruginosins such as dysinosin A8 and oscillarin,9 with thrombin,

revealed the importance of a hydrophobic interaction in the S3 site. Based on these observations, hybrid molecules were designed and synthesized, showing superb in vitro inhibition of thrombin.10 We also reported on the design and synthesis of P2/P3 phenolic core motifs11 as well as P2/P3 pyrid-2-one core motifs (Fig. 1).12 Further refinement of the core motif led to the synthesis of molecules containing a dihydropyrid-2-one with impressive inhibitory activities against thrombin (Scheme 1).13 Protection of 4-methyl piperidine 1 as the N-Boc derivative, followed by oxidation with NaIO4 and RuO2 led to the lactam 2. Formation of the Li enolate and alkylation with ethyl 2-bromoacetate gave 3 in 69% yield. Introduction of an endocyclic double bond was achieved by formation of an enolate, addition of PhSeBr and oxidative elimination. The desired product 4 was accompanied by the a,b-unsaturated ester 5. Increasing the size of the ester (e.g., CO2tBu) favors the endo:exo ratio in a 2:1 fashion albeit in lower total yield (64%). Removal of the N-Boc group of 4 and treatment with t-BuONO and pyridine in Et2O gave the N-nitroso product 6. Reduction with Zn/AcOH followed by treatment with a diverse set of arylsulfonyl chlorides gave the corresponding N-sulfonamides 7a­i. Hydrolysis of the ethyl ester, coupling with the N-Cbz-4-amino-methylbenzamidine, followed by hydrogenolysis, afforded a set of compounds (8a­i) that were evaluated for their enzymatic in vitro activity against thrombin and trypsin. Compounds 8a­i exhibited remarkably different levels of inhibitory activity against thrombin (Table 1). The weakest inhibitor

was the benzylsulfonamide 8a. In contrast, the corresponding phenylsulfonamide 8b was five times more active (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). Single or double substitution at the ortho, meta, and para positions were well tolerated regardless of the electronic nature of the substituents (Table 1, entries 3, 4, 6, 8). An electron withdrawing ortho-F substituent (8e) was less favorable (Table 1, entry 5). By far, the best combination of substituents were found to be at the two ortho-positions, exemplified by the chloro analogue 8g,

with an IC50 of 3 nM against thrombin, and excellent selectivity against trypsin (Table 1, entry 7). A naphthylsulfonyl group was also well tolerated (Table 1, entry 9). There is a remarkably improved inhibition for the dihydropyrid2-one series compared to the pyrid-2-one series.12 Included in Table 1 are the IC50 values of identical compounds in both series except for the nature of the P2/P3 heterocyclic core. Between 25- and 100-fold enhancement of inhibitory activity was observed in each

case with improved selectivity against trypsin compared to the pyrid-2-one series. In view of the otherwise virtual identity of these pairs of compounds, we attribute the greatly enhanced activity in the dihydropyrid-2-one series mainly to the higher pKa of the sulfonamide NH group (see 8i vs 9i in Tables). It is possible that this results in a better antiparallel H-bonded interaction with Gly 216 (Fig. 2).6­9,14 At physiological pH (pH $7.4), the corresponding pyridones are deprotonated with a delocalised negative charge at the sulfonamide N and may be so also in the complex with thrombin. Thus, a direct H-bond with the Gly 216 carbonyl group is not possible. It should be noted that the thrombin assay is run at pH 7.4. The X-ray structure of compound 9i in complex with thrombin has been solved at 1.61 Å resolution. As seen in Figure 3, there are no direct H-bonds between the ligand and Gly 216 in thrombin. The distances between the sulfonamide nitrogen and the amide oxygen of Gly 216 and between the pyrid-2-one oxygen and amide nitrogen of Gly 216 are 4.36 and 3.87 Å, respectively. The corresponding distances in the X-ray of a dihydropyrid-2-one naphthyl

analogue with a different P1 moiety are 3.08 and 3.01 Å, indicative of direct H-bonding (data not shown). The pKa of 9i sulfonamide group is 5.8 and in the crystallization conditions the pH is 7.2­ 7.4, which is similar to pH 7.4 used in the thrombin activity measurements. It is therefore likely that the sulfonamide group in the pyrid-2-one 9i is negatively charged, whereas it is neutral for the dihydropyrid-2-one analogues. These data support the hypothesis that pKa of the sulfonamide nitrogen strongly influences the affinity to thrombin. In conclusion, we have shown that structural information derived from co-crystal complexes of natural product inhibitors of thrombin can be used for the design and synthesis of totally achiral congeners. Dihydropyrid-2-ones with IC50 values below 10 nM against thrombin have been achieved which is a dramatic improvement compared to the closely related pyrid-2-one analogues. We attribute this to the pKa differences of the sulfonamide nitrogen resulting in a productive H-bonded interaction with Gly 216 for the dihydropyrid-2-ones. Subtle differences in the nature of sub-
