Abstract-The red macroalga Corallina oficinalis contains a bromoperoxidase whose activity is vanadium-dependent. This enzyme has been purified to homogeneity as judged from non-denaturing PAGE and SDS-PAGE. Sedimentation equilibrium studies gave a value for M, of 740 000, whereas a M, of 64 000 was obtained by SDS-PAGE. The native enzyme thus appears to be an oligomer, probably of 12 identical subunits. Kinetic studies for the bromination of monochlorodimedone (MCD) gave the following: Kz-, 1.0 mM; K?Oz, 60 PM and KEcD, 21 PM. The bromoperoxidase showed remarkable thermostability, retaining appreciable activity at 60-70" and recovering the original activity on re-equilibration to 25", even on repeated cycles of this temperature regime. The enzyme also showed tolerance to a range of organic solvents and chaotropic agents.

INTRODUCTION

Marine organisms produce an abundance of halogenated compounds [l]. The structures of these range from simple aliphatic haloketones and brominated phenols to sesqui- and diterpenes and more complex molecules. It is probable that these compounds provide some selective environmental protection against predators and microbial colonization. Although bromide concentration in sea-water is substantially less than that of chloride, it is nevertheless about 1 mM and its incorporation into organic compounds is catalysed selectively by the halogenating enzyme bromoperoxidase. This enzyme catalyses the oxidation of bromide by hydrogen peroxide accompanied by either further oxidation to produce singlet oxygen or bromination of an available organic substrate [Z]. Bromoperoxidases are widespread in marine algae [3], and are found particularly in the red, and to lesser extent, brown algae. The bromoperoxidase from Penicillus capitatus, a green alga, is a haem protein [4], and showed broad specificity in also catalysing oxidation of chloride and iodide. Another green alga Rhipocephalus phoenix [5l also possesses a haem-bromoperoxidase and this class of enzyme was reported to be present in a red alga Cystoclonium purpureum [6]. However, bromoperoxidases from some other algae proved to have vanadium as a cofactor [a. This class of bromoperoxidase has been isolated from the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum [8, 93, Fueus distichus [lo], Laminaria saccharina [ll], Mucrocystis pyrijka [lo], and the red algae Ceramium rubrum [12], Corallina pilulifera [ 13,141 and Corallina vancouveriensis

[2]. In Ascophyllum nodosum [15] and Macrocystis pyrifera [16-j isoenzymes with different subcellular location occur. The lichen Xanthoria parietina [ 17) containing the green alga Trebouxiu also has a vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase. Bromoperoxidases are also found in some prokaryotes such as Pseudomonus aureofaciens [ 183 and Streptomyces phaeochromogenes [19]. These possess a haem-containing bromoperoxidase. One of the four isoenzymes of Streptomyces griseus bromoperoxidase [20] was also of the haem-class, but the other isoenzymes were apparently non-haem, as were two bromoperoxidases from a Streptomyces aureojuciens [Zl]. Enzymes in this third group of haloperoxidase apparently lack a metal or prosthetic group. The reaction catalysed by vanadium-bromoperoxidase is a halide.-assisted disproportionation of H,Oz [9. lo], involving some intermediate whose chemical nature is uncertain (Fig. 1). The vanadium, as V+`, binds H,O, and bromide in undefined sequence [22] but is not directly involved in catalytic turnover [S] ; the reaction via an as yet unidentified intermediate is a Bi Bi Ping Pong mechanism [22]. Bromide inhibition is evident at excess bromide and at pH5.25, but does not occur at pH 5.9 or higher pH values [22]. A range of compounds can act as substrates for bromoperoxidases, including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols and /I-diketones [23]. This suggests biotechnological potential in production of speciality chemicals or in synthesis of novel halogenated compounds, given an amenable source of enzyme [24]. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the vanadium bromoperoxidase from the red macroalga Corallina
21

22 oflcinalis. A preliminary communication been made elsewhere [25].

D. J. SHEFFIELD et al. of this work has moved from the enzyme giving a decrease in activity. The purified enzyme lacked evident colour and its absorption spectrum in the visible range was featureless, indicating that haem was absent. The final preparation showed a activity of 470 pmol substrate utilized specific min-`mg-' protein with a recovery of 22.5%; these data suggest that the bromoperoxidase contributes some 1.5% of the soluble protein of the alga, an appreciable amount. The specific activity is considerably higher than reported for the purified vanadium bromoperoxidases from other red algae [12-141, and brown algae [ll, 151 other than Macrocystis pyrifera and Fucus distichus [lo]. The pH optimum for the enzyme was 6.4 in phosphate buffer (Fig. 3), though the activity in Tris buffer at the lowest pH within its effective buffering range was somewhat higher. Whether the bromoperoxidase retains its vanadium better in this latter buffer, which had been used throughout the purification, was not investigated. The bromoperoxidase was homogeneous on PAGE and SDS-PAGE. Activity staining of the non-denaturing gel showed a major band coincident with Coomassie blue staining.

RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

Enzyme purijcation The bromoperoxidase from C. oficinalis could be readily purified from algal extracts, the major problem being the persistence of phycoerythrin. This reddishpink phycobiliprotein is the major soluble protein in C. oficinalis, and because of its very high absorption coefficient [26] even traces are visually evident in the bromoperoxidase preparation. A typical purification is presented in Table 1. Polyphenols and tannins, which are a major problem in purification of the enzymes, notably from some brown algae where recourse to aqueous polymer two-phase systems is advantageous [27], did not prove a problem with the red alga. The inclusion of protease inhibitors in the extract was unnecessary. The enzyme obtained after gel filtration on Biogel A5M showed traces of impurities including phycoerythrin on SDS-PAGE and a final purification by FPLC proved necessary (Fig. 2). The specific activity of the enzyme was lowered somewhat by this treatment but this may be explained by the presence in the extract of a chloroperoxidase(s), which might have sufficiently broad halogen specificity to show some activity in the assay for bromoperoxidase. It may also be significant that the bromoperoxidase from C. officinalis was subsequently shown to be vanadium-dependent; during isolation, this cofactor may be progressively re-

Molecular properties The very low R, of the bromoperoxidase on PAGE under non-denaturing conditions suggested that the enzyme has a very large M,. This was determined by meniscus-depletion sedimentation equilibrium which gave a M, of 740000. The plot of log vertical fringe displacement vs radial distance' was linear throughout so that the only significant uncertainty in the determination was the assumed value for partial specific volume, V,used in the Edelstein and Schachman equation. This was taken to be 0.74, as used in similar calculations with the vanadium bromoperoxidase from Corallina piluZi@ra [28] where M, was estimated as 790000. The M, values reported for the corresponding bromoperoxidases from other algae have been considerably lower: Ascophyllum nodosum, 400000 from crystal diffraction [29] and 97000 by sedimentation equilibrium [30]; Lmninaria saccharina, 104 000 by PAGE [ 1 l] and Ceramium rubrum, 240000 by PAGE [12-J. The large size of the C. o&inalis bromoperoxidase suggested an oligomeric structure, and this was clearly demonstrated by the M, of 64000 on SDS-PAGE, suggesting 12 subunits in the native enzyme. This is in agreement with data for the enzyme from C. pilulifera where the conformation of the subunits in two superimposed hexagonal rings was evident from electron microscopy [28]. The M, values derived from SDSPAGE for other algal bromoperoxidases range from 64000 to 74000 [lo, 11, 25, 301, though that for Cermium rubrum bromoperoxidase may be lower [12]. The pl found for C. ojjicinalis bromoperoxidase was 3.9. Kinetic properties

using a non-linear regression data analysis program (Enzfitter, from Biosoft, Cambridge). The data obtained for crude extracts and for purified bromoperoxidase are shown in Table 2. The close correspondence of values found for the pure bromoperoxidase and enzymic activity in crude extracts (except for K2'2 which is higher in the latter), suggest that bromoperoxidase is the only enzyme reacting with bromide and MCD in the cell. Comparison with comparable data for Kf,- and Kz02 for other bromoperoxidases show close correspondence; for C. pilulifera bromoperoxidase, the only other from a red alga studied in this respect, the corresponding values were Kz-, 10 mM and Kfzoz, 92 PM [28]. The K,MCD these for other bromoperoxidases has not been reported. It should be noted that the K, values for each substrate quoted in Table 2 are for the optimum pH only and at a saturating concentration for the two other substrates. For studies of the reaction mechanism for Ascophyllum nodosum bromoperoxidase, determination of K, values at different pH values and for a range of substrate concentrations for each of bromide and H,O, when the K, for the other was determined [8], showed that Kiz02 was highly affected by pH; in the pH range 4-6 the aflinity of the enzyme for H,Oa strongly increased, though it then remained almost constant above pH 6. Of a range of metal ions, the bromoperoxidase was activated only by vanadium (Table 3); vanadium dependence of the partially purified enzyme from C. oficinalis has been reported previously [31]. The enhancement of activity, which was about two-fold, took several minutes at 0". The enzyme from C. o&in&is can thus be classified as a vanadium bromoperoxidase, like the bromoperoxidases from other brown and red algae [ 10-13, 25, 30).

SHEFFIELD et OZ.

The purified enzyme from a number of algae possessed about 0.6 V atoms per subunit [17-J and this stoichiometry suggested that there was a progressive loss of the metal ion during purification, with a 1: 1 ratio being present in uivo and in isolated enzyme after supplementation with the cofactor [ll]. However, an alternative explanation for the decreased amounts of vanadium in the purified enzyme may lie in the magnitude of the association constant K, for cofactor and apoprotein; 5.5 x lo-* M 1301. This is close to the concentration of vanadium in sea water (5 x 10-s M) suggesting that the concentrations of enzyme and apoenzyme in the algal cell should be almost the same. With 12 subunits in the oligomer it is evident that if overall there are about 0.5 V per subunit, oligomers solely of this composition or mixtures of oligomers of 0 and 1 V per subunit represent the two possible extremes. This parallels the situation with glutamine synthetase of some prokaryotes, an enzyme of similar oligomeric structure where the prosthetic group is an adenyl moiety, but where attachment of this is itself catalysed enzymically [32].
Thermostability

significant activity was retained, at the highest temperature about 20%. Remarkably, however, all these extracts, within experimental error, recovered their original bromoperoxidase activity when re-equilibrated at 20". The comparable experiment with the purified enzyme yielded similar data. There was no loss of activity at 55", and retention of 55% of the original activity at 70". Though activity was lost at 90" here, as at 70", activity was recovered fully after readjustment to 20". Some enzymes of low M,, e.g. RNase, are thermostable but the bromoperoxidase is very much larger, with the subunit being of M, about 64000 and the oligomer of M, 740000. The purified bromoperoxidase is able to withstand repeated treatments at elevated temperatures (Fig. 5). When maintained at 60" the enzyme lost about 50% of its activity, but regained the original activity on transfer back to 25". On two further cycles of the temperature adjustment the enzyme continued this oscillation between 50% and 100% of the original activity.
Stability to organic solvents and ekaotropic agents

The stability of the vanadium bromoperoxidases to a temperature of 55" has been observed previously [33] for enzymes from brown algae, though that from the red alga Ceramium rubrum proved less resilient [ 121. The bromoperoxidase from C. ojkinalis proved to be extremely thermostable (Fig. 4). The enzyme in algal extracts showed enhanced activity when extracts were adjusted to 30", with assay at 25", and retained this higher activity for at least 30 min when transferred to 20". At 50" there was retention of 90% of enzymic activity. Even at 70" and 90

The stability of C. oficinalis bromoperoxidase to ethanol, methanol, propan-l-01 and acetone was tested; tolerance of these would be an advantage in any biotechnological application involving bromination of an organic compound only sparingly soluble in aqueous solvents. For these studies, summarized in Fig. 6, pure enzyme was used. The bromoperoxidase showed comparable properties in all four solvents retaining >80% activity after 24 hr in 10% (v/v) solvent. Even at 30% (v/v) solvent about 60-70% activity was retained over this period. The highest stability was in acetone. Moreover, in each solvent, the residual activity after 2 hr

Experimental points are the activities given as the perceritage of original activity for assays at 3,4 and 24 hr and are given as the mean & s.d. (n = 3).

incubation remained within experimental error more or less the same up to 24 hr exposure, suggesting that long term exposure of enzyme to organic solvent might be feasible. The bromoperoxidase did not regain the original activity on transfer from organic solvent to aqueous solution, suggesting that the lower activity was a consequence of slow but irreversible inactivation. The observation has important implications for use of the enzyme in syntheses of brominated compounds. There was also good retention of activity in enzyme exposed to 6 M urea; here 70% of activity was retained at 3 hr and 24 hr. The vanadium bromo~roxi~s from Ascop~yll~ dosum [33] and Xu~~~or~u ~r~~j~ [lq have also proved tolerant of ethanol, methanol and propan-l-01, though to a somewhat lesser extent compared with the enzyme from C. officinalis.

EXPERIMENTAL

Coralline oficinalis was harvested from rock pools in the intertidal zone(SN 578 817 and SN 603 887) and after washing in tap water the plants were stored at -20". Typically, algae (1 kg wet wt) were homogenized for 5 min in I vol of 0.2 M Tris-H,SO,, pH 8.3, using a Waring blender. The extract was strained through 2 layers of muslin and centrifuged at 1600013 and 4" for 20 min. The extract was brought to 30% satn with (NH&SO4 and allowed to stand for 2 hr before a further centrifugation under the conditions used previously. The supematant was retained and adjusted to 60% satn with (NH&SO,. After several hr (conveniently overnight) the pptd protein was recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in a minimum vol of 50 mM Tris-H,SO,, pH 8.3. After dialysis against this buffer to lower conductivity to < 5 mmho the dialysate was loaded on to a column (185 mm x 26 mm diam.) of DEAE-Sephadex A25 (Pharmacia). This was developed by a gradient of 11 of 0-SOOmM KBr in 50 mM Tris-H,SO, pH8.3, at a flow rate of

0.4 ml min - `. Fractions (10 ml) collected during elution were assayed for protein (A rs,, .,) and enzymic activity. Fractions containing most of the enzyme activity were pooled and coned on a coIumn of DEAE-cellulose before gel filtration on a column (720 mm x 26mm diam.) of Biogel A5M (Biorad). This column was developed with 50 mM Trisl-H,SO,, pH8.3, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min- I. Fractions (10 ml) containing bromoperoxidase were pooled and coned and portions further purified by FPLC (Pharmaciaf using a mono-Q HR5 column; vols larger than accommodated by the standard delivery system were loaded using a superloop. Procedure was according to the man~acturers instructions with development by step gradient over the range O-l M KBr in 50 mM Tris-H,SO, pH 8.3 (24 ml total vol) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min-`. Fractions of 1 ml collected during elution were assayed for protein (A,,, ",) and enzymic activity. Protein determinations were by Coomassie Blue binding (Biorad) using a microassay protocol, and BSA as standard. Activity measurements were carried out at 25" using monochlorodimedone (MCD) as the substrate and following the decrease in A,,, nm after conversion to monobromomonochlorodimedone [3]. The assay mixture for initial stages in purification contained in a final vol of 3 ml: 300 pm01 KBr, 600 ~01 Na,SO, 300 ~01 KH,P04 (pH 6.4), 150 nmol MCD and 5-20 ~1 of extract containing 2-3Opg protein. Other than where indicated, the reaction was initiated by the final addition of 3.2 pmol H,O,. Concns of H,O, and MCD were established accurately by measuring A,,, nm(E, 43.6 M- `cm-`) and A 290 nm (E, 20.2 mM-`cm-`), respectively [33]. Enzyme thermostability was tested by heating crude extract (0.5 mg protein ml-`) to the appropriate temp. At intervals, portions were withdrawn and assayed for bromoperoxidase activity. Studies of temperature cycling, the effect of organic solvents and chaotropic agents, and of various metal ions on enzyme activity were with purified enzyme at 0.1 mg protein ml-`.
