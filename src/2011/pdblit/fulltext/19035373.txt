The pharmaceutical industry and chemical biology are dominated by organic chemistry, with inorganic compounds playing only a minor role. This is well illustrated by a review of drugs approved by the FDA during 2007 in which not a single compound contains a metal atom, with most compounds being reversible enzyme inhibitors.[1] However, our laboratory recently demonstrated that chemically inert metal complexes can serve as promising scaffolds for the design of enzyme inhibitors, and we have reported several compounds with high affinities and promising selectivity profiles for protein kinases and lipid kinases.[2­4] For example, we have recently introduced the ruthenium half-sandwich complexes HB12 and DW12 (Scheme 1) as potent protein kinase inhibitors, in particular for GSK-3 and Pim-1.[5­7] DW12 and its derivatives induce strong biological ACHTUNGREresponses such as the activation of the wnt signaling pathway in mammalian cells, strong pharmacological effects during the development of frog embryos, and the efficient induction of apoptosis in some melanoma cell lines.[8, 9] Here we present the extremely high-affinity organoruthenium inhibitor (RRu)-NP549 (Scheme 1), which displays at most low picomolar binding affinity for GSK-3, and report our elucidation of its binding to GSK-3b by X-ray crystallography. Compound (RRu)-NP549 is the result of a brief structure­activity ACHTUNGRErelationship study starting with the plain scaffold HB12. We found that the introduction of a hydroxy group into the pyridocarbazole heterocycle, leading to DW12 (IC50 = 2 nm), results in a tenfold increased potency for GSK-3.[6] Introduction of an additional fluorine at the pyridine moiety improved the binding affinity by almost another order of magnitude (NP309, IC50 = 0.3 nm).[10] Moreover, in an independent previous study we discovered by a combinatorial approach that the introduction of a d-alanine amide side chain onto the h5-cyclopentadienyl moiety of HB12 increased its affinity 40-fold ((RRu)HB1229).[11, 12] In view of these results, we were curious to investigate by how much we could further improve potency if we were to combine these beneficial modifications at the cyclopentadienyl and pyridocarbazole moieties in one molecule. Accordingly, we synthesized the individual stereoisomers of NP549 (see the Supporting Information for synthetic details) and found (RRu)-NP549 to be an extremely potent inhibitor for GSK-3b, with an IC50 of 40 pm at 100 mm ATP.[13, 14] Since this IC50 was measured in the presence of the lowest practicably possible GSK-3b concentration of 100 pm, this value reflects an upper limit. Because GSK-3b displays a Km value for ATP of 15 mm, the binding constant can be estimated as Ki 5 pm by application of the Cheng­Prusoff equation.[15] With this value, (RRu)-NP549 is one of the highest-affinity ligands for a protein kinase known to date[16] (Figure 1). In order to investigate the binding mode of this class of ACHTUNGREorganoruthenium complexes to GSK-3b, we crystallized fulllength human GSK-3b, soaked it with a solution of enantiomerically pure (RRu)-NP549, and solved to a resolution of 2.4  (Table 1). The global structure reveals the typical two-lobe protein kinase architecture, connected by a hinge region, with the catalytic domain positioned in a deep intervening cleft and (RRu)-NP549 occupying the ATP-binding site, similar to the binding of staurosporine and synthetic organic inhibitors (Figure 2).[17] Compound (RRu)-NP549 forms a number of hydrogen bonds within the ATP-binding site of GSK-3b (Figure 3). Together, the maleimide moiety and the indole OH group establish three important hydrogen bonds to the backbone of the hinge region:

The second carbonyl group of the maleimide moiety forms a water-mediated contact to Asp200. An additional hydrogen bond is established with the amide carbonyl group at the cyclopentadienyl moiety, which is in a water-mediated contact to Thr138. The carboxylate group does not form any particular hydrogen bond but is well placed close to a positively charged patch formed by Arg141 and Arg144, thus contributing to electrostatic attraction. Furthermore, the fluoride atom is close to the amino group of Lys85 (3.1 ), which suggests a weak F···HÀN hydrogen bond. Compound (RRu)-NP549 is involved in extensive van der Figure 1.

This is below the van der Waals distance and I/s (outer shell) 14.4 (2.1) suggests dipolar interactions.[18] We have also observed such 19.0 (22.7) Rwork (Rfree) [%] hetero groups ACHTUNGRE(RRu)-NP549 close contacts to glycine-rich loops in crystal structures of rermsd bond length 0.016 lated organometallic compounds with the protein kinase Pimrmsd bond angle 1.548 1.[7, 10] In addition, Gly63, together with the side chains of Ile62, Ramachandran (allowed/ 91.1/8.6/0.3 Val70, and Phe67, create a small hydrophobic pocket in which generally allowed/disallowed) the CO ligand is buried (Figure 3 C). It is noteworthy that re[a] rmsd = root-mean-square deviation. placing the CO by any other monodentate ligand reduces the binding affinity significantly.[19] For example, exchanging the CO group in HB12 for PF3 (CS44) increases the IC50 around 25-fold, presumably because the PF3 ligand is too big for this pocket, whereas replacing the (h5C5H5)RuCO moiety in HB12 by the highly similar (h6-C6H6)RuCN fragment (NP930) leads to a 75fold diminished affinity (Scheme 1). Such a dramatic effect of the replacement of a CO ligand with a cyanide has also been observed by us previously in a related octahedral scaffold.[19] Although CO and cyanide are isoelectronic, coordiFigure 2.

ATP-binding site and forms three direct hydrogen bonds, two water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and one fluorine-mediated hydrogen bond, undergoes electrostatic contacts between the carboxylate tail and two arginines, and is involved in van der Waals interactions with over ten amino acids. Furthermore, the CO ligand stacks against the glycine-rich loop and is buried in a small pocket, which appears to be crucial for affinity and ACHTUNGREselectivity for GSK-3b. With a Ki value of around 5 pm or less, (RRu)-NP549 is one of the most potent protein kinase inhibitors reported to date, almost four orders of magnitude more potent than the related natural product stauroat sporine (IC50 = 180 nm 100 mm ATP), demonstrating that this organoruthenium structure is a privileged scaffold for the design of GSK-3 inhibitors.

Experimental Section
should not therefore have any tendency to bind into the hydrophobic pocket formed from the glycine-rich loop.[22, 23] These examples demonstrate the importance of the CO group, and we have in fact yet to find a highly potent and selective ruthenium complex for GSK-3 that lacks this apparently crucial CO ligand. Finally, we compared the relative binding position of (RRu)NP549 with cocrystal structures of small organic molecules bound to GSK-3b. A superimposition of all available structures demonstrates that (RRu)-NP549 occupies the same area of the ATP-binding site. However, it seems that the position of the CO ligand, together with the perpendicular orientation to the pyridocarbazole heterocycle, is a unique feature of (RRu)NP549, allowing Val70 to reach down to the pyridocarbazole moiety, thus maximizing the hydrophobic interactions with the pyridocarbazole moiety and creating the hydrophobic pocket for the CO ligand. Although the pyran oxygen atom of staurosporine occupies a position in the active site similar to that of the CO oxygen of the ruthenium complex, the glycine-rich loop is in a significantly more open position, as displayed in Figure 2 E, and does not allow the same closure of the active site with its optimized contacts. In conclusion, here we report an extremely high-affinity GSK3 inhibitor and its binding to the ATP-binding site of GSK-3b. Overall, (RRu)-NP549 perfectly complements the shape of the

Cloning, expression, purification, and crystallization of GSK-3b: GSK-3b was cloned into pET151 vector by use of a ChampionTM pET Directional TOPO Expression kit (Invitrogen). The protein was expressed in Rosetta2DE3 cells as an N-terminal cleavable His6-tag fusion protein with TEV cleavage site. The cells were grown at 37 8C until they reached O.D. = 0.4, at which point the temperature was decreased to 17 8C. Once the cells had reached OD = 0.6, protein ACHTUNGREexpression was induced with isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG (1 mm) overnight. The next morning, the cells were centrifuged, resuspended in lysis buffer [HEPES (50 mm), pH 7.2, NaCl (50 mm), glycerol (5 %)] and supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablets (Roche). The cells were then lyzed by sonication at 4 8C. The supernatant was collected and subjected to ion-exchange chromatography (SP-Sepharose, GE Biosciences). The protein was bound onto the column in HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.2) and eluted with HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.2)/NaCl (1 m). The eluted fractions were applied to a Talon affinity column equilibrated with HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5)/NaCl (300 mm). The column was washed with HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5)/ NaCl (300 mm)/imidazole (20 mm), and the protein was eluted with HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5)/NaCl (300 mm)/imidazole (250 mm). GSK-3b was treated overnight with l-phosphatase and TEV-protease to remove phosphate and His-tag, respectively. Further purification was achieved with a MONO-S column (GE Biosciences). The protein was loaded onto the MONO-S column in HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.2)/ glycerol (10 %)/dithiothreitol (DTT; 1 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient (0­1 m) of NaCl in HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.2), glycerol (10 %), and DTT (1 mm) to ensure the separation of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated species. Non-phosphorylated GSK-3b was sub-

Crystals of the apo-protein were grown at 4 8C in 4 mL hanging drops in which protein solution (2 mL) was mixed with the precipitant solution (2 mL). Crystals were observed in Tris (100 mm, pH 7.2)/PEG 6000 (20 %) or PEG 8000 (12.5 %) within three days. The crystal quality was improved by overlaying oil (50 % silicon oil in paraffin oil, 400 mL) onto reservoir solution (600 mL). Apo-form crystals were soaked with the ruthenium compound overnight at 4 8C in Tris (100 mm, pH 7.2), PEG 6000 (20 %), (RRu)-NP549 (1 mm), DMSO (10 %) and glycerol (1 %). The next morning the crystals were cryoprotected in glycerol (25 %) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data collection and structure determination: Cryoprotected crystals diffracted up to 2.4  on the A1 beam line at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (Ithaca, NY). After indexing and merging of the data (HKL2000), the structure was solved by molecular replacement with use of a crystal structure of GSK-3b (PDB code 1 J1B) as a search model calculated with Phaser. Refinement and manual rebuilding of the model were performed with REFMAC5 and Coot, respectively. Data collection and current refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Coordinates of the structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2JLD). Measurement of IC50 values with GSK-3b: GSK-3b and phosphoglycogen synthase peptide-2 (PGSP-2) were purchased from Upstate Biosciences (USA). Various concentrations of inhibitors were incubated at room temperature in 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS; 20 mm), MgCl2 (30 mm), BSA (0.8 mg mLÀ1), and DMSO (5 %, originating from the inhibitor stock solution) at pH 7.0, in the presence of PGSP-2 (20 mm) and GSK-3b (200 pm for NP930, HB12, and DW12; 100 pm for HB1229, NP309, and NP549). After 15 min, the reaction was initiated by addition of ATP (100 mm), including approximately 0.2 mCi mLÀ1 [g-32P]ATP. Each reaction was performed in a total volume of 25 mL. After 60 min, the reaction was terminated by spotting of 17.5 mL of the reaction mixture onto a circular P81-phosphocellulose paper (diameter 2.1 cm, Whatman) followed by washing four times (five minutes each wash) with phosphoric acid (0.75 %) and once with acetone. The dried P81-papers were transferred to a scintillation vial, and scintillation cocktail (4 mL) was added. The counts per minute (CPM) were determined with a Beckmann 6000 scintillation counter, and IC50 values were defined as the concentration of inhibitor at which the CPM was 50 % of the control sample, corrected for the background.
