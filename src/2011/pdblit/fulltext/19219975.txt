Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases (FNRs) must determine the coenzyme specificity and allow the transient encounter between N5 of its flavin cofactor and C4 of the coenzyme nicotinamide for efficient hydride transfer. Combined site-directed replacements in different putative determinants of the FNR coenzyme specificity were simultaneously produced. The resulting variants were structurally and functionally analyzed for their binding and hydride transfer abilities to the FNR physiological coenzyme NADP+/H, as well as to NAD+/H. The previously studied Y303S mutation is the only one that significantly enhances specificity for NAD+. Combination of mutations from the pyrophosphate or 2-phosphate regions, even including Y303S, does not improve activity with NAD+, despite structures of these FNRs show how particular coenzyme-binding regions resembled motifs found in NAD+/H-dependent enzymes of the FNR family. Therefore, the "rational approach" did not succeed well, and coenzyme specificity redesign in the FNR family will be more complex than that anticipated in other NADP+/NAD+ families.
ABSTRACT:

The only structural difference between NADP+/H and NAD+/H is the presence of a 2-phosphate (2-P) in the NADP+/H molecule, but usually pyridine nucleotide-dependent enzymes distinguish between these coenzymes (1-5). Despite the fact that specificity determinants have been established for different NAD(P)+/H-dependent flavoenzymes and attempts to redesign specificity have been reported (3, 6-10), the mechanism of coenzyme recognition is not completely understood (11). The plastidic ferredoxinNADP+ reductase (FNR,1 EC 1.18.1.2) catalyzes the efficient electron/hydride transfer between low-potential one-electron carriers and NADP+/H, while bacterial FNRs generally exhibit slower turnovers (12). Plastidic FNRs catalyze the transfer of two electrons from two independent reduced ferredoxins (Fd) [or flavodoxins (Fld)] to NADP+ (13). This process is reversible, and FNR is highly specific for NADP+/H versus NAD+/H (2, 14). Additionally, the folding of FNR is the prototype of a family containing both NAD+/ H- and NADP+/H-dependent members (15-18).

Several residues have been reported to determine coenzyme binding, specificity, and enzymatic efficiency in FNR (2, 5, 11, 14, 19, 20). Three main regions allocate them: the binding sites of the 2-P-AMP and the pyrophosphate bridge of NADP+/H and the position occupied by the C-terminal residue where the nicotinamide portion of NADP+ (NMN) must bind for hydride transfer (HT) (Figure 1A) (2, 5, 11, 19, 20). Additionally, the 2-P-AMP binding site contributes to the determination of NADP+/H specificity and coenzyme orientation for HT [particularly, Ser223 and Tyr235 in Anabaena FNR (AnFNR)] (Figure 1) (2, 21, 22). Substitutions in equivalent residues of the 2-P-AMP binding site were efficient in specificity reversion in other flavoenzymes (9, 10, 23), but mutations in FNR have been unable to improve NAD+/H-dependent activities. The loops of residues 155-160 and 261-268 (Figure 1), which accommodate the coenzyme pyrophosphate portion, also confer specificity for NADP+/H in AnFNR (11, 19). Selected mutations at Thr155, Ala160, and Leu263, either individually or in combination, produced for the first time FNRs appar1 Abbreviations: FNR, ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase; FNRox, FNR in the fully oxidized state; FNRrd, FNR in the hydroquinone-reduced state; DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; Fd, Fdrd, ferredoxin and in its reduced state; Fld, Fldrd, flavodoxin in its hydroquinone-reduced state; WT, wild-type; rmsd, root-mean-square deviation; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide portion of NAD(P)+/H; 2-P-AMP, 2phospho-AMP portion of NADP+/H; ET, electron transfer; HT, hydride transfer; CTC, charge transfer complex; kap, apparent rate constant; PP3, T155G/A160T/L263P FNR; PP3CT, T155G/A160T/L263P/Y303S FNR; PP5, T155G/A160T/L263P/R264P/G265P FNR; PP5CT, T155G/ A160T/L263P/R264P/G265P/Y303S FNR; AMP1PP5, T155G/A160T/ S223D/L263P/R264P/G265P FNR; AMP2PP5, T155G/A160T/S223D/ Y235F/L263P/R264P/G265P FNR; kA>B, kB>C, and kC>D, apparent conversion rate constants derived by global analysis.

(B) Structural sequence alignment of different members of the FNR superfamily in the region involved in binding of the coenzyme pyrophosphate portion. For those members for which a three-dimensional structure has not been reported, the alignment corresponds to the primary sequence one. The alignment includes FNRs from Anabaena PCC 7119 (AnFNR) (16), spinach (spFNR) (1), pea (pFNR) (17), and Plasmodium falciparum (PfFNR) (12); rat cytochrome-P450 reductase (rCYP450R) (43); sulfite reductase from Escherichia coli (EcSiR) (44); rat neuronal nitric oxide synthase (rnNOS) (45); human methionine synthase reductase (hMTS) (41); root (46) and leaf (27) corn nitrate reductases (rcNR and lcNR, respectively); rat (41), pig (28), and human erythrocyte cytochrome b5 reductases (47) (rCb5R, piCb5R, and hCb5R); the F subunit of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase Na translocating (UQR) (48); and phthalate dioxygenase reductase from Pseudomonas cepacia (PcPDR) (29).

ently able to bind NAD+ (2, 14, 19). Finally, a conserved aromatic side chain stacks the re face of the flavin, playing a critical role in modulating NADP+/H biding affinity and selectivity (3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 24, 25). In AnFNR, it is the C-terminal Tyr303. Its contribution to lowering the affinity of FNR for NADP+/H, to stabilizing the flavin semiquinone, and to modulating the enzyme midpoint potential and, therefore, the rates of electron and hydride exchange has been proven (5, 26). We have further modeled the NADP+ pyrophosphate binding surface in AnFNR to mimic that in NAD+/Hdependent enzymes and to improve our understanding of the parameters determining coenzyme specificity and substrate localization in the active site. NAD+/H-dependent members

of the family present a proline-rich loop in the NAD+/H pyrophosphate binding site (Figure 1B) (8, 27-29) that has been introduced here in AnFNR. FNR forms combining mutations in the pyrophosphate binding region (PP) and in either Tyr303 (CT) or the 2-P-AMP (AMP) binding site have also been produced. T155G/A160T/L263P/R264P/G265P FNR (PP5) binds NADP+ more weakly than WT FNR, does not form charge transfer complexes (CTCs), and presents a reducedefficiency.T155G/A160T/L263P/Y303SFNR(PP3CT) binds NADP+ and NAD+ and allows flavin-nicotinamide CTC formation and HT with both coenzymes. Structures of these mutants show how particular coenzyme-binding regions were modeled. However, the "rational redesign" did not improve processes with NAD+/H, suggesting that coenzyme

MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis and Protein Production. The AnFNR mutants PP3CT, PP5, T155G/A160T/ L263P/R264P/G265P/Y303S (PP5CT), T155G/A160T/S223D/ L263P/R264P/G265P (AMP1PP5), and T155G/A160T/ S223D/Y235F/L263P/R264P/G265P (AMP2PP5) were produced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (5). S223D, Y235F, R264P, G265P, and/or Y303S replacements were introduced into the pET28-T155G/A160T/L263P AnFNR vector (19, 30). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Mutated pET28-FNRs were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold cells (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (19). UV-visible spectra and SDSPAGE were used as purity criteria. pET28-PP5CT was unable to express protein, despite the fact that different expression conditions were assayed. Spectral Analysis. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary-Bio100 instrument. Parameters for interaction between FNRox mutants and NADP+ or NAD+ were analyzed by difference absorption spectroscopy at 25 °C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (2, 19). Errors in Kd and  were (15%. CD spectra were recorded in a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics Ltd.), in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 25 °C with 10 µM FNR. Path lengths of 0.1 and 0.4 cm were used for far-UV and near-UV-vis regions, respectively. Steady-State Enzymatic Assays. FNR steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using the diaphorase assay with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) at 25 °C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (2, 19). The NADPH activity was assayed using a final FNR concentration of 4 nM. An exception was made with mutants containing S223D, which required higher enzyme concentrations (230-540 nM). NADPH concentrations were in the range of 0-0.4 mM for FNRs without the S223D mutation and in the range of 0-4.5 mM when it was included. Higher FNR concentrations were required for reactions with NADH (230-542 nM). The only exception was PP3CT FNR (4 nM). The concentration of NADH was in the range of 0-2.6 mM. The kinetic results were interpreted using the Michaelis-Menten model. Estimated errors in Km and kcat were (25 and (10%, respectively. Pre-Steady-State Kinetic Measurements.

Single-wavelength measurements were carried out at 25 °C using the SX.18MV software and FNR concentrations of 10 µM. Measurements simultaneously recorded in the 400-1000 nm range were taken every 2.56 ms at 6 °C using XScan and 25 µM FNR (21). Reduced proteins were prepared by photoreduction (26, 31). The concentrations of NAD(P)+/H coenzymes were in the range of 10-250 µM. Higher coenzyme concentrations were occasionally analyzed for FNRs containing S223D. Single-wavelength apparent rate constants (kap) were calculated by fitting the data to monoor biexponential equations. Errors in kap were (15%. Timedependent spectral deconvolution was performed by global

Biochemistry, Vol. 48, No. 14, 2009 3111 analysis and numerical integration methods (Pro-K, Applied Photophysics) (21). Data collected from 0.00128-0.05 to 0.00128-2 s were fit to single-step (A > B), two-step (A > B > C), or three-step (A > B > C > D) models, allowing estimation of the apparent conversion rate constants (kA>B, kB>C, and kC>D). The single-step mechanism sometimes applied when part of the reaction occurred within the dead time; therefore, the observed process was notated as B > C. Species A, B, C, and D are spectral species, reflecting a distribution of enzyme intermediates at a certain point along the reaction, and do not necessarily represent a single distinct enzyme intermediate. kA>B, kB>C, and kC>D denote rates of conversion between these species. The expected species involved are the substrates, products, and the CTCs FNRox-NADPH (CTC-1) and FNRrd-NADP+ (CTC-2), as previously reported (21). In the reaction of PP3CT FNRox with NADH, the kA>B constant exhibited a saturation dependence, allowing the determination of KdNADH (21). Reactions between FNRox and Fldrd or Fdrd were followed at 600 and 507 nm, respectively (26). Proteins were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio and a final concentration of 10 µM. Crystal Growth, Data Collection, and Structure Refinement. Crystals of PP3CT, PP5, and a complex of PP3CT with NAD+ were grown by the hanging drop method (Supporting Information). The X-ray data set of PP5 was collected at beamline BM16 of the ESRF (Grenoble, France) on a Marccd detector with a wavelength of 0.97954 Å and a maximum resolution of 1.5 Å. Data sets of PP3CT, free and in complex, were collected using graphite-monochromated Cu KR radiation generated by Bruker rotating anodes (MICROSTAR or Bruker-Nonius) with PLATINUM 135 CCD and Kappa2000 CCD detectors, respectively. All crystals belonged to the P65 hexagonal space group. Unit cell dimensions and other experimental data are detailed in Table SP1 of the Supporting Information. One FNR molecule was found in the asymmetric unit, the Vm values being 2.85, 3.3, and 2.92 Å3/Da for PP3CT, PP5, and the PP3CT-NAD+ complex, respectively (solvent contents of 56.9, 62.7, and 57.83%, respectively). Data set collection and processing were as indicated in the Supporting Information. The native FNR structure (PDB entry 1que) was used as the search model. Refinement of structures was performed with CNS (32), REFMAC 5.0 (33), and manual model building with O (34). The PP3CT and PP5 models comprised residues 9-303, one FAD, one SO42- molecule, and 508 and 586 solvent molecules, respectively. The PP3CT-NAD+ complex consisted of residues 9-303, one FAD, one NAD+, and 430 solvent molecules. PROCHECK (35) and WHATCHECK (36) were used to assess the quality of the final structures. The presence of NAD+ in the PP3CT-NAD+ complex was confirmed by Fo - Fc simulated annealing omit map calculation by CNS (32). RESULTS Expression and Purification of the FNR Mutants. AnFNR mutants exhibited protein yields, as well as UV-vis and CD spectral properties, similar to those of WT. Therefore, the mutations did not prevent either the assembly of the FAD or protein folding. Nevertheless, PP3CT exhibited UV-vis spectral maxima slightly shifted to shorter wavelengths relative to WT (273, 387, and 455 nm) and weaker intensities

for positive and negative signals at 273 and 286 nm in the near-UV CD (2, 30). This is in agreement with the loss of the interaction of the flavin ring with Tyr303 (37). This mutant had a high affinity for NADP+ during purification, as Y303S (5, 14), showing displacement of its maxima (271, 401, and 472 nm when NADP+ is bound). Removal of the coenzyme was achieved with an affinity Cibacron-blue column (30). Attempts to express PP5CT were unsuccessful. The lack of stability in the 260s loop was also reported in pea FNR mutants (20). Interaction of FNRox Mutants with NADP+ and NAD+. Despite the fact titration of PP5 FNRox with NADP+ produced a difference spectrum with a maximum at 509 (Figure 2A), the pattern of the spectrum was different from that expected for a stacking interaction between the NMN portion of NADP+ and the isoalloxazine. However, the appearance of the band at 509 nm suggests a modification of the flavin environment with regard to WT. Saturation of the difference spectra with an increase in NADP+ concentra+ tion allowed determination of KdNADP and  (Figure 2A, + inset, and Table 1). KdNADP values were 3.7- and 2-fold weaker than for WT and T155G/A160T/L263P (PP3), respectively (19), and 509 indicated low occupancy (if any) of the isoalloxazine environment by the nicotinamide (5). Titration of PP3CT with NADP+ (Figure 2B) produced spectral perturbations consistent with NMN-flavin stacking (5). However, binding was 1 order of magnitude weaker, with a lower level of stacking, than for Y303S FNR (Table 1). Addition of mutations at the 2-P site to PP5 prevented difference spectra upon NADP+ titration, indicating that NADP+ hardly binds to these mutants.

The WT FNR spectrum remains unaltered upon addition of NAD+ (2). PP5 elicited a weak difference spectrum similar to that reported for PP3 and to that observed for the WT FNR-NADP+ interaction (19) (Figure 2A,C). Therefore, although binding is produced, there is no proof for a stacking at the active site. Addition of the S223D and Y235F mutations produced a less defined difference spectrum (Figure 2C). NAD+ titration of PP3CT (Figure 2D) elicited a spectrum similar to that obtained with NADP+ (Figure 2B), suggesting interaction between the nicotinamide and the isoalloxazine. Small changes in the band positions suggest + differences in the interaction (Figure SP1A).

PP3CT restored the strength of the enzyme-coenzyme interaction (Table 2). Thus, the catalytic efficiency of PP3CT was in the WT range, but that of PP5 was reduced, in agreement with its lack of stacking. PP5 increased kcatNADH with regard to PP3, while its KmNADH was similar (Table 2). PP3CT increased kcatNADH and decreased KmNADH with regard to those of WT. Thus, for both mutants, the catalytic efficiency was improved with regard to that of WT (Table 2) and the specificity for NADPH decreased, particularly in PP3CT (Table 2). FNR mutants including mutations in the 2-P binding site were highly impaired with both coenzymes (Table 2). Fast Kinetics Studies of the Reactions of the FNR Mutants with NADP+/H and NAD+/H. Reaction of WT FNR with NADPH produces a fast biexponential absorption decrease at 460 nm, related to the formation of the FNRox-NADPH complex followed by HT from NADPH to FAD (21, 38, 39). The kinetic traces at 460 nm for the reaction with PP5 fit to a considerably slow monoexponential process (Table 3 and Figure SP1B of the Supporting Information). However, the reaction of PP3CT showed a kap similar to that of WT FNR and improved with regard to those of the PP3 and Y303S mutants (Table 3 and Figure SP1B of the Supporting Information). The reaction of WT FNR, and of most of the mutants reported to the date, with NADH is extremely slow (2, 5, 19). The only exception is Y303S FNR (5). Kinetic traces for the reaction of PP5 fit a monoexponential process as slow as that of WT (Table 3 and Figure SP1C of

the Supporting Information), while the PP3CT mutant exhibited a rate 2 orders of magnitude faster (Table 3). Introduction of the S223D and/or Y235F mutations practically abolished HT from NADPH to FNR, while HT from NADH remained in the low WT levels. Reactions of PP5 and PP3CT variants with NAD(P)+/H were further analyzed in the 400-1000 nm range (Figure 3). Processes of PP5 were considerably slow, with very small amplitudes and detection of minor traces of CTCs. Reaction of PP3CT FNRox with NADPH produced a long-wavelength band attributed to a CTC interaction between FNRox and NADPH (CTC-1) within the dead time (Figure 3A) (21). Subsequent evolution of flavin band I, indicating FNR reduction, was concomitant with the appearance of a 800-900 nm band corresponding to FNRrd-NADP+ CTC (CTC-2) in equilibrium with CTC-1 (Figure 3A and Table 4). The first recorded spectrum after NADP+ was mixed with PP3CT FNRrd was consistent with fast association of FNRrd with NADP+ to produce CTC-2 (21). It evolved with a negligible increase in the intensity of flavin band I while slightly decreasing the intensity of CTC-2 (Figure 3B). Reaction of PP3CT FNRox with NADH fit an A > B > C model. The first species after mixing was consistent with the presence of FNRox and traces of CTC-1 (568 nm) but rapidly evolved (Table 4 and the inset of Figure 3C). kA>B for this process exhibited a saturation dependence on the NADH concentration, allowing estimation of a KdNADH of 30 µM. B indicated further accumulation of CTC-1, reduction of band I, and the appearance of CTC-2 (Figure 3C, inset). B evolved by decreasing the amount of CTC-1 accompanied by a considerable reduction in the amount of FNR with a coenzyme concentration-independent rate constant (Table 4). Reduction of NAD+ by PP3CT FNRrd also fit to an A > B > C model (Figure 3D). A was consistent with free FNRrd in equilibrium with FNRox traces. Evolution of A was linearly dependent on the coenzyme concentration (k2  1 µM-1 s-1). B showed a slight increase in the absorption at 460 nm and the appearance of CTC-2 (798 nm) and evolved in a coenzyme concentration-independent process with the appearance of traces of FNRox and a decrease in the level of CTC-2. Processes of WT FNRox and FNRrd with NAD+/H were extremely slow (Table 4), without the appearance of any CTC interaction. Y303S FNRox reacted with NADH through an A > B > C > D model, corresponding to the fast formation of CTC-1, followed by FNR reduction to CTC-2 that evolved toward release of NAD+ once HT takes place (decrease in the magnitude of the CTC-2 band) (kA>B > 380 s-1; kB>C

Fast Kinetics Reduction of FNR Mutants by Its Protein Partners, Fd and Fld. Reduction of all FNR mutants by Fdrd was very fast, indicating they were able to efficiently interact with and accept electrons from Fdrd. Slightly slower processes were observed for the reduction by Fldrd (Table 3) (26), consistent with the larger contribution of the NADP+ domain to the interaction with Fld (13). Three-Dimensional Structures of the FNR Variants. The structures of PP3CT and PP5 did not present significant differences with regard to WT FNR (CR backbone rmsd of 0.27 and 0.32 Å, respectively) (Figure 4A). None of the mutants containing the S223D mutation produced crystals. The mutations provoked a retraction in the 261-265 loop conformation, particularly in PP5 (Figure 4A) where the loop deviated with regard to WT, PP3CT, and the WT FNR-NADP+ complex by 1.06, 0.82, and 0.73 Å, respectively. Thus, this structure resembled that of the WT FNR-NADP+ complex in the 260s loop (Figure SP3 of the Supporting Information) (11). This led to the loss of the

Mutations at positions 155 and 160 produced additional effects (19). A Thr at position 160 allowed the formation of a H-bond between its OH group and the main chain O of Thr157, as reported for PP3 (19). Finally, upon replacement of Tyr303

with Ser in PP3CT, a water network partially replaces the position of Tyr303 and a water molecule keeps the H-bonds formed by the Tyr OH group in the WT (Figure 4B).

phate moiety of NADP+ should bind (5, 16, 40). A change in the conformation of this chain has been shown to be essential for H-bonding to the NADP+ pyrophosphate bridge (11, 40). The high resolution allowed discrimination between two alternative conformations for Gln237, Met266, and Glu301 in PP3CT (Figure 4C) and also suggested such a possibility for Thr302 and Ser303. Cocrystallization of PP3CT with either NAD+ or NADP+ yielded crystals with only NAD+. The overall FNR folding was similar to that of the free mutant (rmsd of the CR backbone of 0.50 Å). The electron density map assigned to NAD+ showed strong densities for the adenine and the pyrophosphate. The calculated Fo - Fc omit map at 2.5 confirmed the presence and conformation of the NAD+ inside the binding site in a fashion very different from that expected

in WT (Figure SP4B of the Supporting Information). Since no crystal packing interactions were observed in this region, this structure appears to be a binding mode stabilized in the crystallization conditions that might be somehow populated in solution at the pH at which the crystals were grown. The adenine of the coenzyme stacked against the re face of the FAD pyrazine, in the cavity in which the nicotinamide would be expected (Figures 4C and SP5 of the Supporting Information) (5, 11). The second conformation of Glu301 stabilized the position of the adenine by forming two H-bonds with N1. Other nitrogens of the adenine make H-bonds with Thr157, Gly158, Cys261, and Ser303 (Figure 4C). Two conformations are observed for the pyrophosphate moiety of NAD+, stabilized by Arg100 (Figure 4C). The electron density map corresponding to the nicotinamide portion was

Modulation of NADP+ Binding in Anabaena FNR not visible. This can be attributed to multiple conformations in the crystal molecules. DISCUSSION We have modeled the AnFNR NADP+ pyrophosphate binding surface by producing the PP5 and the PP3CT variants. Despite both mutants being able to interact with NADP+ and NAD+, PP5 does not appear to allow flavinnicotinamide interactions efficient for HT (Figure 2A and Table 1). The structure of PP5 shows changes in the H-bond network with regard to WT, which, together with less conformational freedom of the prolines and the removal of Leu263 and Arg264 chains, produces a compact conformation of the 260s loop (Figures 4B and 5A). Thus, a displacement of the 260s loop with regard to WT FNR, L263P FNR, and PP3 (Figure SP3 of the Supporting Information) (2, 19), as well as a broader binding cavity, is observed (Figure 5A,C). However, this mutant binds NADP+ more weakly than WT, and there is no evidence of better nicotinamide stacking (Figure 2A and Table 1). Displacement of the 260s loop also produced the weakening of the H-bond interactions between Tyr303 and the 261-265 loop (Figure 4), a feature conserved in most of the FNR-like NADP+/Hdependent members (5, 11). Therefore, nesting of the nicotinamide in the active site in WT might be somehow favored by the H-bonds connecting the terminal carboxylate and the 260s loop, although the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Altogether, these structural modifications might be related to the reduced catalytic efficiency and HT rates (Tables 2 and 3). This suggests that substrate orientation in the WT active site might be induced by recognition through its 2-AMP (2, 21), but also through the geometry of the 260s loop and the changes induced to adapt the coenzyme pyrophosphate (11, 20). The surface conformation around the 260s loop of PP5 resembles that of NAD+/H-dependent members (Figure 5A,E,F) (41). Despite the fact that these features might explain the weak binding to NAD+ (Table 2 and Figure 2C), they do not correlate with an enhancement of reactivity (Tables 3 and 4). Therefore, the transfer of sequence motifs did not work as expected. This might be due to the new cavity being unable to complement the shape and charge of the coenzyme. Additionally, since NAD+-dependent members have a slightly different NAD+ domain to FAD domain relationship, which we did not redesign, nonadequate domain-domain relationships might be also behind the lack of activity. The PP3CT structure shows a coenzyme binding cavity even broader than that of PP5 (Figure 5B), with the 260s loop and C-terminal Tyr connected through only one of the two H-bonds present in WT (Figure 4B). Its complex with NAD+ showed an unexpected relationship between the flavin and the coenzyme (Figure 4C). Since close flavin-nitotinamide stacking and CTCs are observed for processes with PP3CT, this nonproductive complex must represent a minor contribution in solution (Figures 2 and 3). However, it suggests that the wider cavity might allow different dispositions of the nicotinamide in the active site, in agreement with the decrease in the HT efficiency with regard to Y303S (Table 3). Therefore, mutations in the pyrophosphate binding region might allow additional freedom in the active site chains,

Biochemistry, Vol. 48, No. 14, 2009 3117 further contributing to breaking the specificity for the nicotinamide. Thus, PP3CT slightly restores the turnover and catalytic efficiency with NADPH (limited in Y303S by the strong binding and the rate of product dissociation and in PP3 by the weak binding) (5, 19) and shows less specificity for NADPH than WT (Table 2). Finally, HT from reduced PP3CT to NADP+ hardly occurred, in agreement with the less negative reduction potential expected for this variant (5, 26). PP5 was further modified by replacement of S223 and Y235, situated in the AMP binding site, with residues found in NAD+/H-dependent enzymes (Figure 1) (2). The produced mutants were not catalytically efficient with either NADP+/H or NAD+/H (Tables 1-4). This is in agreement with residues at the 2-P-AMP site providing coenzyme binding energy (4, 13), as well as allocating the 2-P-AMP moiety to induce the conformational changes required to reach an optimal disposition of the nicotinamide for HT (2, 11, 21). Therefore, so far, only FNR mutants including the Tyr303 to Ser mutation are reported to produce CTCs with NAD+/H and to show some HT ability with this coenzyme. The mutations introduced into the FNR pyrophosphate binding site modeled particular regions of the coenzyme binding cavity, making them more similar to those of NAD+/Hdependent members of the family (Figure 5). However, they are far from being perfectly adapted to NAD+. In fact, the final effect produced when mutations are combined in FNR is difficult to predict. It might be also that the NAD+-specific motifs work well only in the context of a particular FAD domain to NAD+ domain relationship. In conclusion, protein regions far from the active center, but involved in the protein interaction with the 2-P-AMP and pyrophosphate, suffer conformational changes upon coenzyme interaction. These structural changes are sensed by the active center, being the HT efficiency dependent on the correct orientation between the reacting atoms. Therefore, it is feasible to think that the proteins of the FNR family have adapted their NAD(P)+ binding site to interact with the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes modulating the flavin-nicotinamide interaction to unique orientations. In this way, FNR-like domains can adapt to the coenzyme oxidation or reduction rates required in each particular ET chain where they work. We still need to identify these additional parameters involved in structure-function relationships to understand the implication of different protein regions in the catalytic mechanism. Thus, the "rational approach" in the redesign of the coenzyme specificity in the FNR family is more complex than initially expected. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. I.
