Abstract The X-ray structure of methanol dehydrogenase (MEDH) from Paracoccus denitrificans (MEDH° PD) was determined at 2.5 A resolution using molecular replacement based on the structure of MEDH from Methylophilus methylotrophus W3A1 (MEDH-WA). The overall structures from the two bacteria are similar to each other except that the former has a longer C-terminal tail in each subunit and shows local differences in several insertion regions. The ``X-ray sequence'' of the segment aGly444­aLeu452 was established, including one insertion and seven replacements compared with the reported sequence. The primary electron acceptor of MEDH-PD is cytochrome c-551i (Cytc551i). Based on the crystal structure of MEDH-PD and of the published structure of Cytc551i, their interactions were investigated by molecular modeling. As a guide and starting point, the covalently attached cytochrome and PQQ

domains of the alcohol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida HK5 (ADH2B) were used. In the modeling, two molecules of Cytc551i could be accommodated in their interaction with the MEDH heterotetramer in accordance with the two-fold molecular symmetry of the latter. Two models are proposed, in both of which electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions make major contributions to inter-protein binding. One of these models involves salt bridges from aArg99 of MEDH to the heme propionic acids of Cytc551i and the other involves salt bridges from aArg426 of MEDH to Glu112 of Cytc551i. Both involve salt bridges from aLys93 of MEDH to Asp75 of Cytc551i. The size and nature of the cytochrome/quinoprotein heterodimer interfaces and calculations of electronic coupling and electron transfer rates favor one of these models over the other.

Introduction
Electron transfer between biomolecules that are free in solution is an active and thoroughly debated field of research [1, 2] that suffers from a paucity of structural information concerning the transient complex that forms during the electron transfer event. The bacterium

Paracoccus denitrificans has provided a powerful and convenient system for studying the mechanism of longrange intermolecular electron transfer. For example, the methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) enzyme system of P. denitrificans is located in the periplasm of that organism and consists of a quinoprotein (MADH), a cupredoxin (amicyanin) and a c-type cytochrome (cytochrome c551i, abbrev. Cytc551i). Crystalline complexes of MADH with amicyanin and of MADH/amicyanin with Cytc551i have been analyzed by X-ray crystallography [3, 4], by steady-state and stopped-flow kinetics [5, 6] and by site-directed mutagenesis [7, 8]. P. denitrificans contains another electron transfer system in the periplasm, methanol dehydrogenase (MEDH-PD), that catalyzes the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Electrons released during this reaction are passed along a soluble electron transport chain first to Cytc551i, then to cytochrome c550, and then to a membrane-bound cytochrome oxidase [9, 10]. This system has also been isolated from several other organisms, including Methylophilus methylotrophus W3A1 and Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. In these methylotrophs, electrons are passed from MEDH to the oxidase via cytochrome cL and cytochrome cH1 [9, 10]. The electron transfer kinetics between MEDH and cytochrome cL or Cytc551i have been studied in solution [11, 12, 13, 14]. However, structural information on these enzymes is limited. The structures of MEDH from M. methylotrophus W3A1 (MEDH-WA) [15] and from M. extorquens AM1 (MEDH-AM) [16] are known at medium or high resolution, as is the structure of P. denitrificans Cytc551i [4, 8]. However, no structure of an MEDH and a cytochrome cL from the same organism are known, let alone a complex between them, limiting any molecular interpretations of the kinetic results. MEDH and MADH are both quinoproteins, containing an orthoquinone group as part of their redox cofactors [9]. The cofactor for MADH is tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ), which consists of two crosslinked tryptophan side chains, one containing the orthoquinone group. The cofactor of MEDH is pyrroloquinolinequinone (PQQ), a three-ring molecule containing a pyrrole ring, a phenyl ring and a pyridine ring, and which is substituted by three carboxylate groups. The structures of two monomeric quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases homologous to MEDH have recently been determined [17, 18]. Each of these consists of an intramolecular complex between a $550-residue PQQ-containing quinoprotein domain and an $80-residue c-type cytochrome domain; they are connected in both cases by a $20-residue linker peptide.

In order to provide a basis for a structural interpretation of the electron transfer properties of the MEDH system, we have undertaken a structure analysis of MEDH from P. denitrificans (MEDH-PD). This structure could then be used, in conjunction with the known structure of Cytc551i, also from P. denitrificans, to begin modeling studies of their transient electron transfer complex as a starting point for the design of experiments to elucidate their mode of interaction. MEDH is an a2b2 heterotetramer with subunits of approximately 67 kDa and 9.5 kDa molecular mass, respectively. The crystal structures of MEDH-WA and MEDH-AM show that the heterotetramer is composed of a pair of closely associated ab subunits related by a molecular two-fold axis of symmetry. Each enzyme molecule contains two molecules of PQQ and two calcium ions that are essential for activity. Each a subunit is an eight-fold b-propeller, and each propeller blade is a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet. The PQQ is located approximately on the pseudo-eight-fold axis of symmetry of the b-propeller. Each bsubunit is largely in an extended conformation and is wrapped over the surface of an asubunit. Some remarkable structural features have been observed in the MEDH structures [15, 16], such as a vicinal disulfide at the active center and a ``tryptophan docking motif'' in the b-propeller superbarrel. According to its gene sequence [19, 20], MEDH-PD contains 599 and 83 amino acids in its a and b subunits, respectively, and shows $65% sequence identity to MEDH-WA [15]. Sequence alignment indicated that there were six multi-residue insertions and two singleresidue insertions in the a subunit of MEDH-PD. Both the a and b chains are longer than in MEDH-WA, with 20 and 14 additional residues at the C-termini of their respective subunits. In contrast, the MEDH-PD gene sequence displayed about 78% sequence identity to MEDH-AM [21], with one deletion in the MEDH-PD sequence. In this paper the X-ray structure of MEDH-PD, determined by molecular replacement and refined at ° 2.5 A resolution, is presented. In addition, an investigation of the interactions of MEDH-PD with Cytc551i by molecular modeling based on the molecular structures of MEDH-PD and Cytc551i is described. Two hypothetical models for this complex were obtained, both involving salt bridge and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the two proteins.

Materials and methods
Crystallization The purified MEDH-PD [22] was stored in 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) in the presence of approximately 10 mM methanol. The initial screening [23], using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, gave thin plate-like crystals from a droplet initially composed of equal volumes of 20 mg/mL enzyme solution and of a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 30% PEG

845 4K, 0.2 M Li2SO4. The crystals used for X-ray diffraction were grown by macro-seeding [24]. The seeds were obtained within several days by directly mixing the protein and the precipitant, and the final concentrations in the droplet were as follows: 5 mg/mL protein, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.2 M Li2SO4, 30% PEG 3350. Seeds with good morphology were selected, washed in a proteinfree solution and macro-seeded into a 30 lL solution which contained fresh protein and was similar to that used for growing the seeds except that the concentration of PEG was 28%.

X-ray data collection The X-ray data were collected using a Hamlin multiwire area detector at 4 °C from one crystal that was mounted in a mother liquor-filled X-ray capillary and immobilized by cotton fibers to prevent crystal slippage. The crystal belongs to space group P21212 ° ° ° with cell parameters a=113.34 A, b=122.28 A, c=107.36 A. There is one heterotetrameric molecule per asymmetric unit. The ° processed data [25] were 93.8% complete to 2.49 A resolution and gave Rsym of 9.3%. The data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. Crystallographic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the file name 1LRW.

Structure determination and refinement The structure of MEDH-PD was solved by molecular replacement using the program MERLOT [26]. The molecular structure of ° MEDH-WA, refined at 2.4 A resolution [15], was used as the search model after first omitting PQQ, Ca2+, water and the side chains of the residues which differ in the two species. An unambiguous solution was obtained when the data were limited to ° I>3r(I) within the resolution range of 8­4 A. The solution gave an ° initial R-factor of 42% at 2.5 A resolution after rigid body and scale factor refinement. Based on this model, an electron density map was computed and used for fitting the omitted side chains to generate the starting model used for refinement. However, none of the C-terminal extensions to either chain of MEDH-PD was introduced at this stage. The structure was refined in two stages, first using the program package X-PLOR [27] for several rounds and then using CNS for a ° total of 16 rounds [28]. All the data to 2.5 A resolution were used to refine the structure except for 10% selected randomly for a test data set used for monitoring Rfree [29]. Using CNS, the model was refined using simulated annealing [30] starting from 2500 K with a ° ° cooling rate of 25 K per cycle. Data between 40 A and 2.50 A resolution were used and a bulk solvent correction in CNS was used. During subsequent refinement, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were not applied because some surface side chains were found to be very different in conformation in the two dimers as a result of intermolecular interactions. PQQ was restrained to be planar [15] throughout the refinement. The model was manually adjusted using the graphics software TURBOFRODO [31]. The sigmaA-weighted (2Fo)Fc) and (Fo)Fc) electron density maps were regularly calculated for purposes of manual model rebuilding. In addition, for questionable regions, such as the locales of various insertions, several weak C-terminal segments and an eight-residue segment that showed disagreement with the DNAdeduced amino acid sequence (see below), simulated annealing omit maps [32] were carefully examined. Solvent molecules were gradually included in the model, and only those with thermal ° parameters lower than 50 A2 and with a reasonable hydrogenbonding environment were included in the final model.

Molecular modeling Initially, the MEDH­Cytc551i complex was modeled manually using ADH2B ([17], PDB entry 1KV9) as a guide. The coordinates of Cytc551i (lacking eight C-terminal residues that were unresolved

in the structure) were taken from the structure of the MADH­ amicyanin­Cytc551i ternary complex ([4], PDB entry 2MTA). The starting model was constructed by first aligning a b-propeller heterodimer of MEDH-PD and a Cytc551i molecule onto the b-propeller domain and the cytochrome domain, respectively, of ADH2B. TURBO-FRODO [31] was used to carry out model manipulations. In the starting model it was found that Cytc551i exhibited spatial overlap with the MEDH-PD involving segment 63­70 of the cytochrome and segment 544a­557a of the

846 heterodimer. This segment of MEDH-PD corresponds to part of a 14-residue insertion into the ADH2B sequence, within the funnellike entry channel of the b-propeller leading to PQQ, and is conserved in all known MEDH structures. The Cytc551i molecule was then manually translated along the ° MEDH surface by 8­10 A to avoid the 14-residue insertion and to eliminate unreasonably close contacts, and then rotated in different ways in a search for surface and electrostatic complementarity. Some side chains were manually adjusted to allow formation of potential inter-protein salt bridges. The second half of the model was then generated by utilizing the two-fold symmetry of the MEDH-PD molecule. Additional manual adjustments of global and side chain orientations were done to relieve close contacts and find additional interactions while maintaining the two-fold molecular symmetry. Only two reasonable models of the MEDH­Cytc551i complex were obtained by this process. Each of them was energy-minimized using the program CNS for 200 cycles. This was followed by Cartesian molecular dynamics simulation in CNS, during which the integration time was set to 0.5 fs; 1000 steps were executed at 298 K. For these calculations, the standard CNS CHARM19 parameter set was used; for the electrostatic energy component, a simple Coulomb's law potential was used with a dielectric constant of unity. In the final stage, a further round of energy minimization (200 cycles) was carried out for each model. The minimized energy of the two models is listed in Table 2. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed throughout the minimization and the molecular dynamics simulation procedures.

Results
Crystal structure quality ° The structural model of MEDH-PD, refined at 2.5 A resolution, contains one MEDH heterotetramer and 403 solvent molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final values of R and Rfree are 0.179 and 0.238, respectively, and the root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of bond ° lengths and bond angles from ideal values are 0.006 A and 1.38°, respectively. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. aAsp105 in both of the large subunits is located in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot [37] as a result of the unusual strain caused by the presence of an adjacent vicinal disulfide, aCys103­aCys104 [15, 16]. There are also four amino acid residues in cis configuration in each ab dimer, two disulfides in each a subunit and one in each b subunit. The average B values for the last few residues of the C-terminal tails of the a and b subunits are about twoto four-fold higher than the average B-values for each chain (Table 1); the electron density is weak for these residues, but can be followed at lower contour levels (0.6­0.8 r). Crystal structure of MEDH-PD and comparison with other MEDHs Figure 1 shows a ribbon diagram of the ab heterodimer of MEDH-PD. Each heterodimer consists of 683 amino acids, 600 in the a subunit and 83 in the b subunit. Like the other MEDH structures, the a subunit is an eightfold b-propeller containing PQQ located approximately on the pseudo-eight-fold axis of symmetry. Additional structural features in common include the presence in each ab heterodimer of several disulfide bridges, four cis-amino acids and a ``tryptophan docking motif'' (Table 3). A structural comparison of the a and b subunits of MEDH-PD with MEDH-AM and MEDH-WA is pre° sented in Table 4. The low r.m.s.d. of the Ca ($0.4 A)

Other calculations The buried surface area was computed using AREAIMOL (DIFFERENCE MODE) in the CCP4 program suite [33]. Other calculations of various surface features were calculated using GRASP [34]. Structure comparisons were carried out using TURBOFRODO [31] and LSQMAN [35]. Electron transfer coupling was analyzed using the HARLEM computer program [36] by either the Pathways approach of Beratan et al. [1] or the direct distance approach of Dutton and co-workers [2].

atoms and high sequence identity between MEDH-PD with MEDH-AM reflect a high degree of structural similarity between them. The similarity of MEDH-PD ° with MEHD-WA ($0.6 A r.m.s.d.) is significantly lower. The structure of MEDH-PD is compared with that of MEDH-WA in Fig. 2. Each of the a and b subunits of MEDH-PD contains 20 and 14 additional C-terminal residues, respectively, compared with MEDH-WA. The C-terminal extension in each MEDH b subunit, bLys70­ bGlu83 (Fig. 1), contains two b-turns, bIle71­bTyr74 and bAsp75­bLys78; the preceding segment, bAsp67­ bIle71, forms a 310 helix. These b-subunit tails extend into the solvent but obey the molecular symmetry. One of these tails makes van der Waals contacts with a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal. The additional C-terminal extension of each a subunit with respect to MEDH-WA, aAsp581­aThr600 (Fig. 1), contains four b-turns: aSer579­aGly582, aSer584­aSer587, aAsp588­aVal591 and aAsn590­aGlu593. The last 15 residues of these tails make intermolecular contacts with the surface of the other a subunit, as shown in Fig. 2. However, the last five residues of each segment do not obey the molecular two-fold symmetry; in one a subunit they turn back toward the original molecular

surface, while in the other they extend into the solvent, thereby avoiding unreasonable interactions and close contacts between crystallographically related molecules (Fig. 2). In addition to the longer C-terminal tails in the a and b subunits of MEDH-PD, there are significant structural differences with respect to MEDH-WA in four other segments, two of which contain insertions (Table 3). An additional polypeptide segment, aLys443­aLeu452 in MEDH-PD, also differs with respect to MEDH-WA and contains an insertion, as described below. These five segments of MEDH-PD are much closer in conformation to MADH-AM and contain no deletions or insertions. ``X-ray sequence'' of the segment aGly444­aLeu452 This segment forms two antiparallel b-strands, held together by a pair of hydrogen bonds: aAsp445 N to aSer450 O and aAsp445 O to aAla449 N (Fig. 3a); the corresponding segment in MEDH-WA is in a random coil conformation. According to the published amino acid sequence of MEDH-PD [19], the segment preceding

In MEDH-WA there is a fourth disulfide corresponding to the positions of aSer150 and aSer173 in MEDH-PD and MEDH-AM There are three cis-prolines at positions 72a, 264a and 387a of MEDH-PD and MEDH-AM and at 72a, 258a and 380a of MEDH-WA. Residues aTrp276 of MEDH-PD and aTrp270 of MEDH-WA are also incis configuration, whereas aTrp264 of MEDH-AM is reported to be trans The tryptophan in the fourth b-sheet of MEDH-WA is replaced by phenylalanine in both MEDH-PD and MEDH-AM This segment contains an a-helix, residues 1­9, and a b-turn, residues 10­13, in all three MEDH structures. ° MEDH-WA has only one residue in common with MEDH-PD and the r.m.s.d. between them is 2.8 A, even though their conformations are nearly the same This segment contains a six-residue insertion in MEDH-PD with respect to MEDH-WA and extends the pair of antiparallel b-strands b2a and b2b [15] of propeller blade 2 further into solution Residue aGln319 is inserted into MEDH-PD with respect to MEDH-WA, resulting in a lengthening of the b-turn loop between b-strands b5a and b5b [15] This segment includes the loop connecting strand b6c and strand b6d [15], which, although closely similar ° in conformation and hydrogen bonding to that in MEDH-WA, exhibits 1.77 A r.m.s.d. with only one of the five residues identical

b-strand b6c [15] has one insertion compared with the sequence of MEDH-WA. However, the electron density of this segment is not consistent with the published MEDH-PD sequence, although its ``X-ray sequence'' could be established on the basis of a simulated annealing omit map (Fig. 3b). The (2Fo)Fc) electron density based on the final model with the X-ray sequence (Fig. 3a) contains one insertion and seven replacements compared with the published amino acid sequence [19], and two insertions with respect to MEDH-WA, as shown in Fig. 4. The total number of the amino acids in the a subunit thus turns out to be 600 instead of 599. The amino acid sequences of MEDH from five organisms for this segment are compared in Fig. 4, along with the corresponding DNA sequence reported for MEDH-PD [19]. Six of the nine residues of the X-ray sequence are identical to the corresponding ones in MEDH-AM [21] and M. organophilus XX [39]. Thus, the X-ray sequence is more homologous to these last two bacteria than to MEDH-WA or the sequence predicted from the gene sequence. Careful examination of the DNA sequence with respect to the protein sequences has failed to identify a possible cause for the discrepancy. Interactions of MEDH with Cytc551i The two models obtained for the interaction of MEDHPD with its electron acceptor Cytc551i each contains a pair of Cytc551i molecules that interacts with a pair of heterodimeric protomers of MEDH, both of which are related by the molecular two-fold symmetry of the latter. ° The iron atoms are about 6 A apart and the models differ by approximately 45° in rotation about an axis

roughly perpendicular to the hemes and passing through the iron atom. In the following description and elsewhere, the two cytochrome molecules are identified as cytc1 and cytc2 and the two MEDH-PD heterodimers as MEDHA and MEDHB. The closest distance between the heme of cytc1 ° and PQQ of MEDHA in models I and II are 17.3 A and ° 17.6 A, respectively, while the corresponding distances ° ° to PQQ of MEDHB are 29.5 A and 25.0 A, respectively. In model I the cytc1 interacts about equally with both MEDH-PD heterodimers, while in model II the cytc1 interacts more strongly with MEDHA than with MEDHB (Table 5). In both models, each cytochrome forms several salt bridges and hydrogen bonds as well as non-polar interactions with both MEDH heterodimers. Between cytc1 and MEDHB there is one salt bridge, Asp75­c93Lys, and one hydrogen bond, Tyr77­cAsn95, common to both models. In addition to these, there is one salt bridge between cytc1 and MEDHA in both models, an additional salt bridge between cytc1 and MEDHB in model I, four additional hydrogen bonds in model I (two to MEDHA and two to MEDHB) and six additional hydrogen bonds to MEDHA in model II (Table 5). These residues have normal B-values and are clearly defined in the electron density; their salt bridge and hydrogen bonding interactions are shown in Fig. 5. There are also three symmetric pairs of hydrogen bonds within the cytc1/cytc2 interface in model II but none in model I. The interface between cytc1 and MEDHA is twice as large in model II than in model I, while between cytc1 and MEDHB it is half as large as in model I (Table 5). The surface areas of the cytochrome and MEDH molecules that become buried upon complex formation in the two models are given in Table 5.

Discussion
Refinement of MEDH-PD Further refinement of the MEDH-PD structure using a maximum likelihood target, as implemented in CNS, together with analysis of SigmaA-weighted electron

density maps, led to improvement of Rfree to 0.230 from the value of 0.306 obtained at the end of the X-PLOR refinement stage. On the other hand, R changed only marginally, probably because of over-refinement at the X-PLOR stage during frequent remodeling in weak electron density. The use of CNS enabled additional structural features to be modeled, such as the poorly defined C-termini of both subunits and the ``X-ray sequence'' of the segment aGly444­aLeu452. Modeling of the MEDH­Cytc551i complex The two hypothetical models for the interactions of MEDH-PD with its electron acceptor Cytc551i, presented in this paper, were established using the independently determined crystal structures of MEDH-PD (this work) and Cytc551i [4]. The initial modeling was based on the structure of ADH2B, a covalent intramolecular complex between an eight-fold b-propeller containing PQQ and a cytochrome c. This was a reasonable approach since the PQQ domain of ADH2B is 37% identical in sequence to MEDH-PD and matches its ° structure with an r.m.s.d. of 1.15 A for 480 Ca atoms (Table 4). The two cytochromes are also similar. Although the ADH2B cytochrome domain contains 88 residues compared to the 155-residue Cytc551i, these 88 residues match closely residues 43­124 of the latter with ° r.m.s.d. of 1.47 A for 68 equivalent Ca atoms (Table 4). Furthermore, when superimposed on the ADH2B structure, the 42 remaining N-terminal residues and 22 ordered C-terminal residues of Cytc551i point away from the ADH2B structure into solution. The manual search for possible electron transfercompetent cytochrome binding sites on MEDH, starting with the ADH2B configuration, could be restricted to a relatively small portion of the MEDH molecular surface. It has been suggested that in order for electron transfer to occur at physiologically relevant rates, the maximum possible edge-to-edge distance between the ° cofactors should not be greater than about 15 A [2]. In ADH2B the heme of the cytochrome domain is in van

der Waals contact with the PQQ domain and the dis° tance between the cofactors is $14 A. If one limits the range of possible van der Waals contact surface points ° for electron transfer to those less than 20 A from PQQ ° (allowing a 5 A safety margin), then only about 12% of the total surface of MEDH-PD needs to be explored. Most of these points are localized to a surface patch of ° about 35 A diameter, centered approximately on the eight-fold pseudosymmetry axis and containing the entrance funnel (Fig. 6a). This consideration also limits the orientations of the cytochrome to those where the exposed heme edge makes contact with the quinoprotein surface. The two most attractive models obtained during manual modeling permitted two cytochromes to bind to the MEDH heterotetramer at the same time (Fig. 6b and Fig. 6c). It is reasonable for two Cytc551i molecules to be able to interact with the MEDH heterotetramer simultaneously, and to impose the two-fold symmetry as a restraint during the energy minimization. Lending support to this hypothesis, it was found that, in a hypothetical dimer of ADH2B generated on the basis of the MEDH-PD molecular symmetry, two cytochrome

domains of ADH2B do not interfere with each other, except for one four-residue segment that differs most with respect to the Cytc551i core structure. Nature of the interface Both MEDH-PD and Cytc551i are negatively charged, with charges of )60 and )20, respectively, and thus would tend to repel each other. The electron transfer rate between the two proteins exhibits a positive correlation with ionic strength, increasing to a maximal rate of about 3 s)1 at l%1.3 M at 30 °C and gradually decreasing thereafter [14]. Despite the large negative charges on the two proteins, however, their putative interaction surfaces close to the redox cofactors are largely neutral and become strongly negative only at the periphery and elsewhere over the molecular surfaces. The lack of surface-charge clustering near the cofactors is reflected by the fact that each cytochrome forms only two or three salt bridges with MEDH in the two models and each of these salt bridges involves a different subunit of MEDH.

The interactions among the Cytc551i and MEDH protomers in the two models reflect the extent of buried surface area between them (Table 5). The buried surface area between MEDHA and Cytc1, to which electron

852

transfer from PQQA would occur, is nearly twice as large ° ° in model II ($800 A2) as in model I ($500 A2), as are the number of polar and neutral hydrogen bonds. Between Cytc1 and MEDHB, the buried surface is nearly threefold smaller in model II than in model I, as are the total number of hydrogen bonds (Table 5). In both models, the two cytochrome molecules are in contact. In model I, no hydrogen bonds are involved in the contact, while in model II the buried surface area between cytochromes is doubled and includes three pairs of hydrogen bonds. The putative electron transfer properties of the two models for the Cytc551i­MEDH-PD electron transport complex were analyzed (see Materials and methods). For model I, two pathways [1] of similar efficiency were identified. One pathway leads from PQQ along a fourresidue polypeptide backbone chain through an arginine side chain to a heme propionate (connected by one of the intracomplex salt bridges). The other leads from PQQ along a three-residue peptide backbone and two side chains to atom CBC of a heme vinyl group. The two routes involve 17 and 20 covalent bonds, respectively, and two through-space jumps each. One of these jumps is from PQQ to the vicinal disulfide bond that lies above the plane of PQQ, and the other is the interprotein jump from MEDH to the heme edge. For model I, the edge° to-edge distance from PQQ to heme is 17.2 A. The direct distance analysis [2] predicts a maximum electron transfer rate of 1·10)1 s)1 with an average atomic packing density (q) of 0.42 and a corresponding b-decay ° factor of 2.0 A)1 (Table 6). The electronic tunneling matrix element predicted for the best electron transfer pathway [1] is also included in Table 6. For model II, a single ``best'' pathway leads from PQQ along the backbone of a four-residue polypeptide chain to heme atom CBC. The route includes 13 covalent bonds and the same two non-bonded jumps. The edge-to-edge distance ° from PQQ to heme is 17.5 A. The direct distance analysis predicts a maximum electron transfer rate of 2 s)1, ° with a q of 0.53 and a corresponding b of 1.79 A)1 (Table 6). For comparison, the same calculations were performed for ADH2B (with and without the waters that are present in the crystal structure). With waters omitted, the best predicted pathway includes 12 covalent bonds, two non-bonded jumps and follows a four-resi-

due polypeptide backbone and one side chain connecting PQQ and heme atom CBC. This path is very similar to that of model II. The direct distance analysis yields a maximum electron transfer rate of 9·103 s)1 over ° ° 13.5 A, with q=0.57 and b=1.72 A)1 (Table 6). When waters are included, the same pathway from PQQ to heme is predicted. However, now one obtains a maximum electron transfer rate of 8·104 s)1 with q=0.66 ° and b=1.55 A)1. Water molecules were not considered in constructing the MEDH­Cytc551i models. However, the results of the analyses of ADH2B with and without water suggest that the coupling and predicted electron transfer rates for the models would be much more favorable with the inclusion of water. The developers of the direct distance analysis have stated that for physiologically relevant reactions one would expect a q=0.76 and b=1.39 [2]. The rather small q and large b values obtained for the models presented here are primarily a consequence of the two throughspace jumps that are observed in the Pathways analysis and influence the atomic packing density between the redox centers. For example, if one omits these spaces and runs the calculation with electron transfer beginning from the aCys103 S to the OG1 of aThr100 (the nearest atom to the heme), one obtains q=0.96, b=0.98 and a maximum electron transfer rate of 2.5·108. As demonstrated earlier, inclusion of water will increase the calculated packing density and decrease b. It may also be reasonable to treat the through-space jump from PQQ to the vicinal disulfide in MEDH and ADH2B as being more highly coupled than a typical non-bonded jump, since structural analysis indicates that their orbitals are nearly in contact. Previous kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the electron transfer reaction from MEDH-PD to Cytc551i [40] predicted an electron transfer distance of about ° ° 15 A when an exponential b decay value of 1.4 A)1 (intermediate between a covalent model system and a vacuum) was used when fitting the data to electron transfer theory. This is in reasonable agreement with the distance between redox centers predicted in the models. It should be noted that the optimum orientation for the docking of the proteins may not be exactly the same as the orientation from which electron transfer occurs. It

was shown for the MEDH-PD­Cytc551i system that the Ka for complex formation and the limiting first-order rate constant for electron transfer from PQQ to heme each varied with ionic strength [14]. Analysis of the ionic strength dependencies indicated that electron transfer was conformationally coupled, suggesting that a rapid but energetically unfavorable conformational rearrangement precedes and optimizes the system for the electron transfer. This rearrangement might bring the redox centers closer, resulting in electron transfer parameters that are in closer agreement with the experimental results. The interactions of MEDH with its specific electron acceptor cytochrome cL in the bacteria M. extorquens AM1, M. methylotrophus and Acetobacter methanolica were previously investigated by chemical modification and cross-liking experiments which indicated that these interactions involve lysine or arginine residues in the a subunits of MEDH and carboxyl groups in the cytochrome cL [12, 13]. There are 30 lysines and 23 arginines in each a subunit of MEDH-PD and 27 acidic residues in Cytc551i. The proposed salt bridge interactions in the two models involve aLys93, aArg99 and aArg426 as the basic residues in MEDH. aLys93 and aArg426 are absolutely conserved in six MEDHs of known sequence, while aArg99 is highly conserved, being replaced by lysine in MEDH-WA and two others. Likewise, the acidic residue Asp75, Glu112 and a propionic acid of Cytc551i are involved in salt bridges in the two models. Asp75, Glu112 and the heme propionates are conserved in cytochrome cL from M. extorquens AM1 [38] and in two of four putative cytochromes cL (Glu112 being replaced by Gln or Asn in the other two). Therefore, these two models are supported by the reported results from chemical modification and cross-linking experiments. Model I involves an additional salt bridge between bLys69 of MEDH and Asp130 of each Cytc551i. Although Asp130 is conserved in cytochrome cL [38], bLys69 is not conserved in all the MEDHs from different bacteria, and its location in the b subunit rather than the a subunit is inconsistent with the experimental results. This latter salt bridge may be only an auxiliary interaction existing in P. denitrificans. Model II appears more likely than model I to represent the actual electron transfer complex for the MEDHPD system. Although it has one fewer salt bridge than model I, the two remaining salt bridges are well conserved across the species. Furthermore, the electron acceptor cytochrome (Cytc1, Table 5) appears to interact more tightly with its electron donor partner (the MEDHA heterodimer, Table 5) in model II than in model I, with a buried surface area similar in size to that in ADH2B. Finally, the electron transfer efficiency calculated for model II is 20-fold higher than that of model I and the b-decay exponential and atom packing density are closer to those of ADH2B (Table 5). On the other hand, model II appears to exhibit stronger interactions between the two cytochrome molecules (six hydrogen bonds compared to all non-bonded interactions) than

does model I, which could affect the dynamics of complex formation/dissociation. An important question in evaluating the two proposed models is whether one or two cytochromes interact with MEDH at any given time during the reaction cycle. In terms of modeling, nothing would prevent a single cytochrome from binding to MEDH in the same orientation as is seen in the model with two cytochromes bound. However, when a single cytochrome interacts with MEDH it might sample several inappropriate sites before achieving the optimum interaction. When a cytochrome interacts with MEDH that already has a cytochrome bound, there would be fewer sampling options available for the second cytochrome. Thus, binding of the second cytochrome when one site is already occupied should be a more efficient process. Previous kinetic studies have provided no evidence of cooperativity in the reaction of MEDH with Cytc551i. It is possible that, during the steady-state reaction cycle, Cytc551i molecules alternate coming on and off of the two equivalent binding sites. This would make binding more efficient, and since there would always be one cytochrome bound when the second interacts, no cooperativity would be observed once the steady state is achieved.
