S. Mariana Margarit,1,5 Holger Sondermann,2,3 Brian E. Hall,1 Bhushan Nagar,2,3 Andre Hoelz,4 Michelle Pirruccello,2,3 Dafna Bar-Sagi,1,* and John Kuriyan2,3,* 1 Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology State University of New York at Stony Brook Stony Brook, New York 11794 2 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Department of Molecular and Cell Biology Department of Chemistry 3 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Physical Biosciences Division University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, California 94720 4 The Rockefeller University New York, New York 10021 residues (Chardin et al., 1993). A central 500 residue catalytic module (SOScat; residues residues 550 to 1050) is sufficient for the Ras-specific nucleotide exchange activity (Figure 1A). This segment of SOS includes a core region known as the cdc25 domain (residues 750 to 1050), so named because of sequence similarity to cdc25, the Ras-specific nucleotide exchange factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Broek et al., 1987; Boguski and McCormick, 1993). SOS and other Ras-specific nucleotide exchange factors also contain an additional domain, known as the REM (Ras exchanger motif) domain, located N-terminal to the cdc25 domain (Lai et al., 1993). The C-terminal segment of SOS contains canonical recognition sites for SH3 domains (Pro-x-x-Pro motifs) and mediates the interaction of SOS with the adaptor protein GRB2, which delivers SOS to the membrane upon receptor activation. SOS also contains a Dbl-homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, located upstream of the catalytic module. The DH and PH domains are implicated in the ability of SOS to activate Rac, a small GTPase of the Rho/cdc42 family (Nimnual et al., 1998). The crystal structure of nucleotide-free Ras complexed to SOScat has been determined previously, explaining how SOS facilitates nucleotide release from Ras (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). In essence, SOS opens up and distorts the nucleotide binding site of Ras, expelling either GTP or GDP bound to Ras. Key features of the mechanism include the movement of Switch 1 of Ras away from the nucleotide binding site and a restructuring of Switch 2 that results in the placement of the methyl group of Ala-59 of Ras at the site where Mg2 is normally bound. A puzzling aspect of the mechanism of SOScat has been the role of the REM domain in the exchange reaction, since it interacts only with one edge of a helical hairpin, which juts out from the main body of the cdc25 domain (Figure 1B). This helical hairpin, containing helices H and I, is responsible for the displacement of the Switch 1 segment of Ras away from the nucleotide binding site, and the REM domain appears to be loosely hinged to the main body of the catalytic module through its interactions with the helical hairpin. Interaction between the REM domain and the helical hairpin is critical for SOS function, since mutations at the interface between them compromise catalytic activity severely (Hall et al., 2001). Nevertheless, the structure of the Ras:SOScat complex showed that interactions between nucleotide-free Ras and SOS are localized to the cdc25 domain, leaving the role of the REM domain unclear (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). During a crystallographic investigation into the effects of a mutation in the Switch 2 region of Ras (Ala-59-Gly) we have made the surprising discovery that SOScat has a second, previously unsuspected binding site for Ras within a large cleft between the REM domain and the surface of the cdc25 domain that is distal to the active site (Figure 1B). The distal binding site is specific for Ras·GTP, hence dictating the formation of ternary Ras·GTP:SOScat:Ras(nucleotide-free) complexes. Ras is

Summary Growth factor receptors activate Ras by recruiting the nucleotide exchange factor son of sevenless (SOS) to the cell membrane, thereby triggering the production of GTP-loaded Ras. Crystallographic analyses of Ras bound to the catalytic module of SOS have led to the unexpected discovery of a highly conserved Ras binding site on SOS that is located distal to the active site and is specific for Ras·GTP. The crystal structures suggest that Ras·GTP stabilizes the active site of SOS allosterically, and we show that Ras·GTP forms ternary complexes with SOScat in solution and increases significantly the rate of SOScat-stimulated nucleotide release from Ras. These results demonstrate the existence of a positive feedback mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of Ras. Introduction Growth factor receptors that signal through tyrosine kinases activate Ras by recruiting the nucleotide exchange factor Son of Sevenless (SOS) to the plasma membrane, thereby facilitating the conversion of Ras·GDP to Ras·GTP (for a review, see Bar-Sagi, 1994). The binding of GTP induces conformational changes in two regions of Ras known as Switch 1 and Switch 2, enabling Ras·GTP to bind to effector proteins and initiate signaling events through them (Milburn et al., 1990; Pai et al., 1989). Once GTP is hydrolyzed, the release of GDP from Ras is extremely slow, and without the action of nucleotide exchange factors, such as SOS and Ras·GDP, is essentially locked in an inactive state (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001).

Figure 1. Structures of SOS and Ras (A) Schematic diagram showing the domain organization of SOS. The REM domain, residues 550­750, was referred to previously as the "N-domain" (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). (B) The crystal structure of the ternary RasY64A·GppNp:SOScat:Raswt (nucleotide-free) complex is shown. The cdc25 domain of SOS is in purple, and the REM domain is in yellow. The C-terminal regions of the two Ras molecules are indicated with black lines. The C-terminal farnesyl and palmitoyl modifications that attach Ras to the lipid bilayer are not a part of the crystallized Ras molecules, but they are expected to emerge out of the plane of the page, toward the viewer. The view is chosen to indicate that both Ras molecules can retain membrane anchorage while interacting with one SOS molecule. (C) The structure of the distal Ras bound to the GTP analog GppNp from the RasY64A complex is shown on the left (structure D). The Switch 1 and Switch 2 regions, defined here as spanning residues 25 to 40 and 57 to 75, respectively, are indicated in red. The expanded view of the nucleotide binding site is for the RasA59G·GTP complex (structure A). The electron density map shown has amplitudes of (|Fo | |Fc|), where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors. Phases were calculated from a structural model that was at a stage of refinement prior to the inclusion of nucleotide in the model. The electron density contours are at 3.5 (blue) and 5.5 (red).

normally anchored to the cell membrane by farnesyl and palmitoyl modifications within the C-terminal region (see Kuhn et al., 2001 and references therein). The Ras constructs used in this study lack the 23 C-terminal residues, but both Ras molecules in the ternary Ras·GTP:SOScat:Ras complex are oriented so as to interact simultaneously with the lipid bilayer.

A striking feature of the ternary Ras·GTP:SOScat:Ras complex is a network of tightly linked interactions, which span the REM and cdc25 domains and Ras·GTP and are suggestive of an allosteric mechanism whereby Ras·GTP stabilizes SOScat and stimulates its exchange factor activity. We measured the rate of release of fluorescent nucleotide derivatives bound to Ras in the pres-

ence of SOScat and found that the addition of Ras·GTP significantly accelerates the rate of SOScat-stimulated GDP release from Ras, whereas the addition of Ras·GDP does not. Taken together, our results point to the presence of a hitherto unsuspected positive feedback mechanism in the activation of Ras by SOS. Results and Discussion We began with an effort to determine the structure of SOScat complexed with RasA59G, a mutant form of Ras that is impaired in both GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange (Margarit, 2002). Unexpectedly, we obtained crystals of a ternary RasA59G·GTP:SOScat:RasA59G complex. In the analysis that follows, we first describe the salient features of the crystal structure of this complex, ° determined at 2.2 A. We then show, using multi-angle light scattering, that wild-type Ras·GTP forms ternary complexes with SOScat in solution and note that the general features of the ternary RasA59G:SOScat complex are recapitulated in a crystal structure of a ternary complex ° formed by wild-type Ras and SOS, determined at 2.7 A. We have also determined the structure of a ternary complex that has wild-type Ras at the active site of SOS and another Ras mutant, RasY64A, bound at the distal site and loaded with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GppNp. The crystal structure of this complex is essentially the same as that of the ternary complex with RasA59G, except that the Switch 2 region is better ordered in this structure. Finally, we demonstrate that GTP or GppNp loaded forms of Ras, but not GDP loaded forms, are able to increase the rate of nucleotide exchange by SOScat significantly. Structure of RasA59G Bound to SOScat RasA59G (human H-Ras, residues 1 to 166, Ala-59-Gly mutant) was expressed in E. coli and purified essentially as described previously for wild-type Ras and mixed in a 5:1 molar ratio with SOScat (residues 564 to 1049 of human SOS1) (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). The resulting complex was purified away from excess RasA59G by size exclusion chromatography. Conditions that resulted in crystals of the original 1:1 complex of SOScat:Raswt (nucleotide-free) did not yield good crystals with this material and, instead, high-quality crystals were obtained with phosphate as the precipitating agent (Form I crystals), and these diffracted X-rays strongly, with a data ° set to 2.20 A measured using a synchrotron source. Form I crystals are substantially improved in diffraction quality over the original crystals of the 1:1 complex, ° which yielded data to only 2.8 A resolution using synchrotron sources (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). The structure of the RasA59G:SOScat complex was solved by molecular replacement (structure A, Table 1, Protein Databank [PDB] code 1NVU), using separate search models for Ras and the REM and cdc25 domains of SOScat. Molecular replacement was straightforward, except that the solutions revealed two molecules of Ras bound to one molecule of SOScat, one at the previously characterized active site (nucleotide-free Ras) and one at the new distal binding site (Ras·GTP) (Figure 1B). A difference electron density map calculated using a structural model from a stage in the refinement prior to the inclusion of nucleotide revealed strong electron

density at the nucleotide binding site of the distal Ras molecule, interpreted unambiguously as being due to GTP·Mg2 (Figure 1C). The structure of nucleotide-free Ras bound to the active site of SOS is essentially the same as that seen previously, except for the presence of a phosphate ion at the nucleotide binding site. Several features of this crystal structure suggest that the distal Ras molecule is bound to SOScat in a functionally relevant manner and is not simply trapped within the crystal as an artifact. First, the distal RasA59G·GTP molecule is well ordered, except for a region in the vicinity of the Ala to Gly mutation at residue 59 (comprising residues 61­66 in Switch 2). Excluding this region, the average backbone temperature factor for the distal Ras ° ° molecule is 32 A2, compared to 31 A2 for the nucleotide° ° free Ras, 25 A2 for the cdc25 domain, and 35 A2 for the REM domain. Second, a large interface is formed between the distal Ras and one SOScat molecule with ° the burial of 3000 A2 of surface area. The extent of this interface (see below) is much greater than the extent of typical lattice contacts in protein crystals and is well within the range expected for functional protein-protein interfaces (Conte et al., 1999). Finally, the distal Ras·GTP molecule makes only one other contact in the crystal lattice, with an extended C-terminal segment of another SOScat molecule, and that contact resembles a loose peptide-protein interaction (data not shown). Thus, examination of the crystal lattice clearly identifies a unique Ras·GTP: SOScat interface as of potential functional importance. The RasA59G:SOScat complex also yielded a second crystal form, which was obtained using polyethylene glycol rather than phosphate as the precipitating agent (Form II). The structure of the complex in crystal form II was also solved by molecular replacement (structure B, PDB code 1NVX). As before, a ternary RasA59G·GTP:SOScat: RasA59G (nucleotide-free) complex was discovered in the crystals, with the presence of GTP at the distal site again being established unambiguously in difference electron density maps (data not shown). These crystals do not diffract X-rays as strongly ° as do Form I crystals, with data to 3.2 A having been measured. Despite the lower resolution, refinement of the structure shows conclusively that the structure of the ternary complex seen in Form I crystals is preserved in Form II crystals, although the intermolecular packing in the two crystal forms is different (data not shown). The presence of Ras·GTP complexed to SOScat:Ras (nucleotide-free) in both crystal forms, having survived purification from E. coli with no added nucleotide present, strongly suggested that the interaction between Ras·GTP and SOScat at the distal site is of functional relevance. Formation of a 2:1 Ternary Complex between Wild-Type Ras and SOScat Multi-angle light scattering measurements (Wyatt, 1997), with solutions containing SOScat and both empty and GppNp bound forms of wild-type Ras, demonstrated the formation of 2:1 Ras:SOScat complexes in solution. Figure 2 shows the protein concentration, light scattering signal, and derived molecular masses for a size exclusion chromatographic analysis of a mixture of wild-type Ras (nucleotide-free), Ras·GppNp, and SOScat.

Figure 2. Light Scattering Data for Complexes of SOScat with WildType Ras (A) Elution profile of a mixture of Raswt (nucleotide-free), Raswt·GppNp, and SOScat complex on a Superdex S200 gel filtration column is shown in blue. In red, the signal from the light scattering detector (at 90 to the incident beam) during the elution is shown. The primary signal (in volts) is plotted against the elution time. (B) Molecular weights determined by light scattering and concentration determination from each data slice (0.5 s increments) is plotted against the elution time. The protein peak as measured by change of refractive index is shown as solid line.

This analysis revealed the existence within the major peak of two distinct and relatively monodisperse populations. Based on this information, the peak was divided into two separate regions (I and II) for determination of molecular weights (Figure 2A). Light scattering data from region I is consistent with a 2:1 complex of Ras and SOScat, with a measured molecular weight of 88.2 kDa ( 0.9%), compared to the calculated molecular weight of 90 kDa for a ternary complex. Region II comprises mainly a 1:1 complex with a molecular weight of 70.8 kDa ( 1.9%), which matches the molar mass of 71 kDa calculated for such a complex. In Figure 2B, the molecular weight corresponding to each slice across the peak is plotted against the elution time, showing that both the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes are well defined in solution. A cumulative distribution analysis (data not shown) indicates that the 2:1 complex accounts for about 60% of the total population of Raswt:SOScat complex. We crystallized a Raswt·GppNp:SOScat:Raswt (nucleo° tide-free) complex and collected X-ray data to 2.7 A using these crystals. Molecular replacement and refinement confirmed that the structure of the ternary complex in which both Ras molecules have the wild-type sequence (structure C, PDB code 1NVW) is essentially the same as that of structures A and B for ternary complexes with RasA59G, except for localized structural changes around the site of mutation in the latter structures. Structure of SOScat Complexed with Wild-Type Ras (Nucleotide-Free) and RasY64A·GppNp Crystals of the ternary Raswt:SOScat complex are significantly smaller than crystals obtained using mutant forms of Ras. One intrinsic difficulty in working with wild-type Ras arises from the ability of SOScat to exchange nucleo-

tides bound to Raswt rapidly. We therefore turned to another Ras mutant, RasY64A, which does not bind to the active site of SOS (Hall et al., 2001). We purified and crystallized ternary complexes, which have a wild-type Ras molecule (nucleotide-free) bound at the active site of SOScat, and RasY64A·GppNp bound at the distal site. For simplicity, we shall refer to the distal Ras in this complex as Ras·GTP, except where it is important to note the presence of the mutation or the GTP analog. Crystals (Form I) of the RasY64A·GppNp:SOScat:Raswt (nucleotide-free) complex diffract X-rays strongly, and ° a molecular model was refined to 2.18 A resolution (Table 1). The resulting structure (structure D, PDB code 1NVV) is very similar to that determined previously for the RasA59G:SOScat ternary complex, except that in this case the Switch 2 region is clearly resolved in electron density maps. Analysis of the distal interface between RasY64A·GppNp and SOScat showed that the alanine residue corresponding to Tyr-64 is located at the interface between the two proteins and forms part of a cluster of hydrophobic interactions between the distal Ras and SOS. Except for differences in the vicinity of the mutated residues in the Switch 2 region, the structures of the RasA59G:SOScat and RasY64A:SOScat ternary complexes are essentially the same. The Binding Footprint of SOScat on the Distal Ras·GTP Resembles that of the Effector Protein PI3-Kinase on Ras·GTP A strong indication that the distal interface between Ras·GTP and SOS may be biologically relevant is provided by the fact that the distal Ras·GTP molecule is bound to SOS in a manner that resembles closely the interaction between Ras·GTP and effector proteins. We chose to compare the distal Ras:Sos interface to that between Ras·GTP and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3kinase), which is the most extensive of the Ras:effector interfaces characterized structurally (Pacold et al., 2000). The conformation of Ras·GTP in the two complexes is essentially the same (Figure 3A). When the distal RasY64A·GTP is superimposed upon Ras·GTP from the PI3-kinase complex, the rms deviation in C atoms ° is 0.5 A (the superpositioning is done by excluding residues in the Switch regions, but the rms deviation is calculated for all 166 residues in Ras). The switch regions are closely aligned in the two structures, with an ° rms deviation within Switch 1 and 2 of 0.65 A in C ° if all atoms within the Switch regions positions (1.5 A are considered). There is no structural similarity between SOScat and the Ras binding elements of PI3-kinase. Nevertheless, both SOS and PI3-kinase interact with a similar set of residues on Ras·GTP (Figure 3A). These interactions involve Switch 1 and Switch 2 at the core, with peripheral interactions with helix 1, loop 1, and strand 2 of Ras. Interestingly, the distal interface between SOScat and ° Ras·GTP is more extensive (3020 A2 surface area buried, ° ° with 1587A2 on Ras·GTP and 1433A2 on SOScat) than that ° between Ras and PI3-kinase (1322 A2 total surface area), which is the most extensive of the Ras-effector interfaces characterized so far (Figure 3B). Thus, not only does the distal Ras·GTP molecule engage SOS in a manner similar to that seen in an effector interaction, it

also does so with an interface that is significantly larger than the extent of currently known Ras-effector interfaces. The Interface between Distal Ras and the REM Domain Is Specific for Ras·GTP The most conformationally dynamic region of Ras is the corner of the molecule where the Switch 1 and Switch 2 regions approach each other closely, near the binding site of the Mg2 ion and the terminal phosphate of GTP (Figure 3C). The distal Ras molecule interacts with the REM domain of SOS using this Switch 1/Switch 2 corner, ° burying 1330 A2 of surface area at this interface, which is bracketed by hydrophobic interactions (Figure 4A). At one end, Pro 34 and Ile 36 of the Switch 1 region of Ras pack against hydrophobic side chains in SOS (Leu-687, Met-726, and Trp-729). At the other end, Met-67 of Switch 2 packs against a hydrophobic crevice formed by Leu-687 (which is also part of the binding site for Switch 1) and Arg-688. Tyr-64 of Switch 2 is also located in this region (Figure 4). A central aspect of the interface is the formation of a tight bidentate hydrogen bonding interaction between Glu-37 of the Switch 1 region of Ras and Arg-688 of SOS. Glu-37 also forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asn-691 and His-695 of SOScat (data not shown). The intermeshing of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 elements of Ras at a common interfacial region of the REM domain of SOS suggests that the structural changes, which occur upon GTP hydrolysis in Ras, would have a profound effect upon the integrity of this interface. Comparison with the structure of Ras·GDP (Milburn et al., 1990) shows that the conformational changes in the Switch regions are such that the engagement of the REM domain by Pro-34, Ile-36, and Glu-37 and residues in the Switch 2 region is precluded in the GDP-bound form of Ras (Figure 3C). The N-terminal region of Switch 2 (around residue 60) moves away from the nucleotide binding site upon GTP hydrolysis, which is accompanied by a significant rotation of helix 2 (also a part of Switch 2) and the unwinding of one turn of this helix. The combined effect of these changes is to compromise the complementarity in shape between the structure of Ras and the distal binding site on SOS, leading to the prediction that Ras·GDP will bind much less tightly to SOS at this site (Figure 3C). Interface between Ras·GTP and the cdc25 Domain The interface between the distal Ras and the cdc25 domain is mainly polar, and involves the base of the helical hairpin of SOS (Figure 4B). In addition to the Nand C-terminal ends of the two helices in the hairpin ( H and I), this hairpin base region also includes helix G, which connects to the first helix of the hairpin ( H) through an eight residue connector (residues 922 to 929; this connector is highly conserved, see next section), and interacts with Ras·GTP. The Ras residues that interact with SOS at this interface are not involved in the GTP-GDP switch. Gln-43, on strand 3 of Ras, is a central anchor of the interaction between the distal Ras and the hairpin base of the cdc25 domain (Figure 4B). The side chain of Gln 43 makes hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl

groups of residues Leu-919 and Ile-922 of the cdc25 domain and also with the sidechain hydroxyl group of Tyr-974. The hairpin base is notable because of the presence within it of the only two cis-proline residues in SOScat (Pro-924 and Pro-925) (Figure 4B). The orientations of the side chain of Asn-923 and of the backbone carbonyl groups of residues 919 and 922 of SOS depend critically on the presence of the two cis-prolines, and each of these groups is involved in interactions with the distal Ras·GTP. Sequence Conservation at the Distal Ras Interface In order to determine whether the residues that interact with the distal Ras·GTP are conserved, we aligned the

sequences of these domains in SOS with those regions corresponding to the cdc25 and REM domains of Rasspecific nucleotide exchange factors such as Ras-GRF, cdc25, and Ral-GDS. These alignments were difficult to interpret, because these Ras-specific exchange factors are rather divergent in sequence and the alignments are not precisely defined in several regions, particularly in the REM domain (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). We therefore restricted our analysis to SOS proteins alone. We have compared the sequence of human SOS1 to the sequences of SOS from two insects, Drosophila melanogaster (accession number AAB04680; Bonfini et al., 1992), and Anopheles gambiae (accession number EAA15144), and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (ac-

The entire ternary complex, in the view used for the expanded illustration (middle, right), is shown on the left. In the middle, some of the key residues at the distal Ras:REM domain interface are indicated. The GTP analog GppNp is shown in orange, and the Mg2 ion is shown as a magenta sphere.

The molecular surface of SOScat is shown at the right, colored according to the conservation in sequence between human SOS1 and SOS from Drosophila, Anopheles, and C. elegans. Sequence similarity was calculated based on the BLOSUM 62 matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1993). Residues that are invariant (100% identical) between the four SOS sequences are colored red, with purple, orange, and yellow indicating sequence similarity at the 90%, 80%, and 70% levels, respectively.

cession number AF251308, Chang et al., 2000), the latter three being the only other organisms for which SOS sequences are available at present (SOS sequences from rat and mouse are also available, but these are essentially identical to the human sequence). The SOS protein is highly conserved throughout the REM and cdc25 domains. The REM and cdc25 domains of human SOS1 are 52% and 61% identical in sequence, respectively, to the corresponding domains in the D. melanogaster SOS protein. For the human-A. gambiae and human-C. elegans comparisons, the levels of sequence identity are 54% and 63% (A. gamabiae) and 34% and 42% (C. elegans), respectively, for the two domains. Examination of sequence variation on the surface of SOScat reveals that in addition to a patch of highly conserved residues at the active site of SOScat, there is also a patch of conserved residues on the surface extending out of the active site and into the REM domain, surrounding the distal surface of SOScat. At the levels of sequence identity which pertain here (35%­55% overall identity in the pairwise comparisons), we expect that residues in the hydrophobic core and the active site of SOScat will be highly conserved but that residues on the surface will not be conserved unless they have func-

tional importance. In particular, it is significant that there is a striking conservation in the surface-exposed residues of SOScat that make contact with the distal Ras·GTP (Figure 4). Several of the residues in SOS that interact with the distal Ras are invariant across all four species. Arg 688, which forms hydrogen bonds with Glu-37 in the Switch 1 region of Ras, is invariant. The two cis-prolines in the hairpin base that forms the core of the cdc25 interface with distal Ras are part of a sequence motif (921SINPPC926 in human SOS1) that is invariant across all four sequences, suggesting that the unusual turn structure is conserved (Figure 4). The conservation of these features of the distal binding site raises the possibility that the distal interaction with Ras·GTP may also be conserved. Structural Changes in SOScat in the Ternary Ras:SOScat Complex We now analyze changes in the structure of SOScat in the ternary complex, with the aim of seeing whether the binding of Ras·GTP might affect the interaction of SOScat with nucleotide-free Ras at the active site. The main consequence of Ras·GTP binding to the distal site on SOS is a rotation of the REM domain relative to the

the REM domain) and Asp-30 (in Switch 1 of nucleotidefree Ras). Lys-602 is invariant in the four SOS sequences that are compared in the previous section. In addition to being facilitated by changes in the orientation of the REM domain, these hydrogen bonds are also a consequence of changes in the structure of Switch 1 of nucleotide-free Ras with respect to the conformation seen in the original structure of the binary complex (Figure 5B). The REM domains in the structures of 2:1 Ras:SOScat complexes show evidence of increased rigidity when compared to the original structure of the 1:1 Ras:SOScat complex. For example, a 23 residue segment between residues 654 and 676 of the REM domain is disordered in the original structure of the 1:1 Ras:SOScat complex but is well resolved in the electron density maps for the 2:1 Ras:SOScat complexes. The mean value of the temperature factors for the REM domain in the ternary ° RasY64A·GTP:SOS:Raswt complex (35 A2 for C atoms) are comparable to the temperature factors for the cdc25 ° domain and the nucleotide-free Ras molecule (27 A2 and ° 2, respectively), whereas the corresponding values 33 A for the REM domain in the structure of the 1:1 Ras:SOScat ° complex (62 A2 ) are much higher than for the cdc25 ° domain and the nucleotide-free Ras molecule (43 A2 for both). Taken together, these structural changes in SOS point to a role for the distal Ras·GTP in increasing the activity of SOScat by stabilizing the formation of a complex between SOS and nucleotide-free Ras at the active site. Measurement of SOS-Catalyzed Nucleotide Exchange Demonstrates an Activating Effect of Ras·GTP The structural results discussed so far suggest that Ras·GTP might potentiate the Ras-specific exchange factor activity of SOS. To determine experimentally whether this is the case, we utilized an N-methylanthranyl derivative of GDP, mantGDP, which allows ready measurement by fluorescence spectroscopy of nucleotide release rates from Ras (Ahmadian et al., 2002). We measured the rate of mantGDP release from wildtype Ras (Raswt) by first loading Raswt with the labeled nucleotide and then measuring the rate of release of the labeled nucleotide in the presence of excess free GDP (unlabeled), in the presence or absence of SOScat, and various forms of Ras loaded with unlabeled GTP (or GppNp) or unlabeled GDP. As shown in Figure 6A, the rate of release of mantGDP from Raswt is slow (the pseudo first order rate constant k is 0.000205/s). The addition of SOScat greatly increases the rate of nucleotide release (k 0.007433/s). The addition of Raswt·GDP, RasA59G·GDP, or RasY64A·GDP (in a 1:1 stoichiometry relative to SOScat) has no significant effect on the rate of release of labeled nucleotide (Figure 6B). Strikingly, when GTP loaded forms of Raswt, RasA59G, and RasY64A are added to the reaction mixture (in a 1:1 stoichiometry relative to SOScat), a significant increase in the rate of mant-GDP release from Raswt is seen in all cases (Figure 6). The most substantial boost in nucleotide release is seen for the addition of RasY64A·GTP, in which case the rate of nucleotide release is increased by 8-fold, to 0.058/s. The measurements described here are for proteins

cdc25 domain, by about 10 . This rotation is pivoted about the base of the helical hairpin in the cdc25 domain (Figure 5A), so that much of the active site of SOScat remains unchanged. The rotation in the position of the REM domain with respect to the helical hairpin is correlated with a change in the interaction between nucleotide-free Ras and SOScat. In the original structure of the 1:1 Ras:SOScat complex there are no interactions between the REM domain and nucleotide-free Ras, and the interactions between the helical hairpin and the Switch 1 region of Ras are ill defined (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). In the new structures of 2:1 Ras:SOScat complexes, the interface with nucleotide-free Ras has changed such that several hydrogen bonds are formed between Switch 1 of nucleotide-free Ras and the new conformation of the REM domain and the helical hairpin (Figure 5B). These include one direct hydrogen bond between Lys-602 (in

freely diffusing in solution. In cells, Ras·GTP:SOS complexes would be tethered to the cell membrane, and it would be interesting to determine whether a facilitated rate of intermolecular encounter in two dimensions might provide an additional enhancement to the rate of nucleotide exchange. Conclusions Our results have shown that the Ras activator SOS is itself subject to positive feedback control by Ras·GTP. This completely unexpected feedback loop was discovered by studying a mutant form of Ras that is slow to hydrolyze and exchange GTP (RasA59G), and subsequently confirmed using wild-type Ras and RasY64A. By binding to the interface between the REM domain and the base of the cdc25 domain, Ras·GTP reorients the REM domain and increases the number of interactions between elements of SOS and the Switch 1 region of empty Ras bound at the active site of SOS. The increase in interfacial interactions at the active site as well as the decreased flexibility of the SOS molecule are likely to be the factors responsible for the Ras·GTP-dependent increase in the catalytic efficiency of SOS. The role of the REM domain in coupling the active site of SOS to the distal binding site for Ras·GTP provides a structural rationalization for the unique architecture of the catalytic module of SOS, in which the functionally essential REM domain is located far from the active site. Our results demonstrate that Ras·GTP is able to increase the rate of Ras-specific nucleotide exchange by SOScat by about an order of magnitude in solution. Such a mechanism, in which the activity of the catalyst (SOS) increases with the local concentration of the product of the reaction (Ras·GTP), has several consequences for the response of SOS to growth factor activation. The importance of feedback loops in generating switching mechanisms with sharply defined on and off states has been noted previously for the MAP kinase pathway (Fer-

rell, 2002). We speculate that the Ras·GTP-dependent feedback loop in SOS may likewise generate a Ras activation response that depends sharply on the strength of the upstream signal acting on cell surface receptors. One implication of our results is that the activity of SOS might depend on the local concentration of Ras·GTP; as more Ras·GTP is produced in a particular region of the cell surface, the activity of SOS in this region will increase in a correlated manner. Such a response in SOS may provide a link between the level of receptor clustering and the level of Ras activation, which is consistent with the observation that Ras activation is localized to sites of receptor clustering (Sawano et al., 2002). It will also be interesting to investigate whether Ras·GTP, by virtue of its interaction with the membrane and with SOS, could prolong the activation of SOS by tethering the exchange factor to the membrane. This has implications for the cellular effects of mutant forms of Ras that are constitutively activated, which might potentiate the activity of normal Ras through interactions with SOS in a receptor-independent manner. The Ras·GTP:SOS interaction resembles that between Ras and effector proteins. Ras·GTP is known to be an activator of exchange factors for GTPases of the Ras subfamily. For example, the nucleotide exchange factor for the Rap1 GTPase, MR-GEF, contains a Ras-associating (RA) domain (Vetter et al., 1999) upstream of the cdc25 domain, at a location that corresponds to that of the REM domain of SOS (Rebhun et al., 2000). M-Ras·GTP activates MR-GEF by binding to the RA domain (Rebhun et al., 2000). Ras itself can be activated in cells by other exchangers working through distinct pathways (Quilliam et al., 2002), and the distal binding site for Ras·GTP in SOS may provide a means of integrating signals generated by these pathways with signals from receptor tyrosine kinases. Analysis of the intact SOS protein has shown previously that the distinct domains of SOS are likely to

Cell 694

interact with each other to set up levels of control within the protein. The DH and PH domains, for example, inhibit the Ras-specific exchange factor activity of SOS (Corbalan-Garcia et al., 1998) and interactions between the PH domain and the DH domains are also implicated in the control of Rac activation (Das et al., 2000). The location of the REM domain is immediately downstream of the PH domain of SOS, and changes in its orientation upon binding Ras·GTP might govern the function of the DHPH unit of SOS. A complete understanding of the complex regulation of SOS awaits integration of this newly discovered allosteric mechanism with the interplay between the various modules of SOS.
Experimental Procedures Protein Purification and Crystallization SOScat (residues 564­1049) and RasA59G (residues 1­166) were cloned into the ProEX HTb expression vector (Life Technology) using the BamH I/Xho I and BamH I/EcoR I sites, respectively. The expression vector fuses an N-terminal polyhistidine tag to the protein. Escherichia coli cells (BL21-DE3, Novagen) were transformed with RasA59G or SOScat constructs and grown in LB medium supplemented with antibiotics (100 mg/l Ampicillin). Protein production was induced with 250 M IPTG at a cell density corresponding to an absorbance of 0.4­0.6 at 600 nm, and the proteins were expressed at 30 C for 6 hr or at 18 C for 15 hr. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 1 hr at 4000 g, resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 300 mM NaCl) containing protease inhibitors and frozen at 80 C. Cell suspensions were thawed in a water bath at 25 C and lysed by French press (EmulsiFlex-C5, Avestin), and cell debris was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor for 1 hr. All purifications were carried out at 4 C. In the first chromatographic step, the clear lysate (from cells expressing either RasA59A or SOScat) was loaded onto a charged Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted using a gradient (0­500 mM) of imidazole in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl (buffer B). Fractions containing the proteins were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B, and concentrated on a Centricon ultrafiltration device (Millipore). After the removal of the polyhistidine tag with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, the proteins were loaded onto a second Ni-NTA column equilibrated with buffer B, and the cleaved proteins were collected in the flow through. The RasA59A:SOScat complex was formed by incubating the two purified proteins, concentrated to 20 and 10 mg/ml, respectively, at 4 C in buffer B, using about a 5-fold molar excess of Ras. The complex was loaded onto a gel filtration Sephadex 75 column (Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated with buffer B and 2 mM DTT. The fractions containing the complex were concentrated to approximately 20 mg/ml, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C. The average yield was around 10 mg complex per 8 liter cultures of Ras and of Sos. The RasA59G:SOScat complex yielded tetragonal crystals in two conditions that are different from the previously reported crystallization condition (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998). Crystals were grown in hanging drops by mixing equal volumes of protein at 10­20 mg/ml and reservoir solutions of 1.2­1.5 M phosphate, 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) (Form I) or 2%­8% PEG 4000, 100 mM MES (pH 6.5) (Form II). In both cases, crystals appeared within 2 days at 4 C, with typical dimensions of 0.2 0.1 0.05 mm3 (Form I) and 0.5 0.25 0.08 mm3 (Form II). For the purification of Raswt and RasY64A complexes, all proteins were expressed as before, except that terrific broth (TB) medium was used. Purification proceeded essentially as described for the RasA59G:SOScat complex, up to the purification of the cleaved proteins. SOScat was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a 5 ml HiTrap Q column (Pharmacia), eluting with a gradient from 0­500 mM NaCl in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) over 20 column volumes. The Raswt:Soscat complex (1:1) was formed by incubating SOScat with a 4-fold molar excess of Raswt in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5) 50 mM

NaCl, 2 mM DTT (buffer C) containing 2 mM EDTA overnight at 4 C. The complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography in buffer C. The ternary complex was formed by incubating the 1:1 complex with a 4-fold molar excess of Raswt or RasY64A loaded with GppNp (see nucleotide exchange assay) for 2 hr at 4 C, and purified to homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography. Form I crystals were obtained as described for RasA59G:SOScat complexes. X-Ray Data Collection and Structure Solution Crystallographic statistics for synchrotron data collection are given in Table 1. Data reduction was carried out with the software packages DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The same tetragonal space group, I422, was encountered for both Form I and Form II crystals; however the crystal packing is different for each crystal type. The unit cell dimensions for Form I crystals are: ° ° a b 183.3 A, c 178.5 A. For Form II crystals the unit cell ° ° dimensions are a b 175.2 A, c 234.1 A. Molecular replacement using AMORE (Navazza, 1994) resulted in the placement of one molecule of Sos and two molecules of Ras per asymmetric unit in both types of crystals. The structures were refined using standard procedures and the programs CCP4, O, and CNS (Brunger et al., 1998; CCP, 1994; Kleywegt and Jones, 1996). Multi-Angle Light Scattering/Size Exclusion Chromatography Purified complexes were characterized by multi-angle light scattering following size exclusion chromatography. Purified complex (50 M) was injected onto a Superdex 200 HR10/30 size exclusion chromatography column (Amersham-Pharmacia) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The chromatography system was coupled to an 18 angle light scattering detector (DAWN EOS) and refractive index detector (Optilab DSP) (Wyatt Technology). Data were collected every 0.5 s at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Data analysis was carried out using the program ASTRA, yielding the molar mass and mass distribution (polydispersity) of the sample. Nucleotide Exchange Assay For nucleotide exchange, 200 M purified Raswt, RasA59G, or RasY64A mutant was incubated with 2 mM GTP or GppNp or mantGDP in loading buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT) for 1.5 hr on ice. Reactions were supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and incubated for 30 min on ice. Free nucleotides were removed by gel filtration using NAP-5 columns (AmershamPharmacia) equilibrated in reaction buffer (40 mM Hepes-KOH [pH 7.5], 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). Dissociation rates were measured on a Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrometer (model LS50B). Fluorescence was excited at 370 nm, and emission was monitored at 430 nm. In a quartz cuvette, 1 M Ras·mantGDP was mixed manually with filtered and degassed reaction buffer supplemented with 200 M GDP and incubated at 25 C in a final volume of 1 mL. When indicated, reactions were supplemented with additional proteins. Dissociation was measured for 360 s. The data were fitted to a single-exponential function Ft A0 kt B (with A0 as the amplitude, B as the fluorescence value at infinite time, k as the apparent dissociation rate constant, and t as time) using the program Prism.
