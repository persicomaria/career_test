ABSTRACT The efficacy of HIV-1 protease inhibition therapies is often compromised by the appearance of mutations in the protease molecule that lower the binding affinity of inhibitors while maintaining viable catalytic activity and substrate affinity. The V82F/I84V double mutation is located within the binding site cavity and affects all protease inhibitors in clinical use. KNI-764, a second-generation inhibitor currently under development, maintains significant potency against this mutation by entropically compensating for enthalpic losses, thus minimizing the loss in binding affinity. KNI-577 differs from KNI-764 by a single functional group critical to the inhibitor response to the protease mutation. This single difference changes the response of the two inhibitors to the mutation by one order of magnitude. Accordingly, a structural understanding of the inhibitor response will provide important guidelines for the design of inhibitors that are less susceptible to mutations conveying drug resistance. The structures of the two compounds bound to the wild type and V82F/I84V HIV-1 protease have been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.0 Å resolution. The presence of two asymmetric functional groups, linked by rotatable bonds to the inhibitor scaffold, allows KNI-764 to adapt to the mutated binding site cavity more readily than KNI-577, with a single asymmetric group. Both inhibitors lose about 2.5 kcal/mol in binding enthalpy when facing the drug-resistant mutant protease; however KNI-764 gains binding entropy while KNI-577 loses binding entropy. The gain in binding entropy by KNI-764 accounts for its low susceptibility to the drug-resistant mutation. The heat capacity change associated with binding becomes more negative when KNI-764 binds to the mutant protease, consistent with increased desolvation. With KNI-577, the opposite effect is observed. Structurally, the crystallographic B factors increase for KNI-764 when it is bound to the drug-resistant mutant. The opposite is observed for KNI-577. Consistent with these observations, it appears that KNI-764 is able to gain binding entropy by a two-fold mechanism: it gains solvation entropy by burying itself deeper within the binding pocket and gains conformational entropy by losing interaction with the protease.

Key words: HIV protease; drug resistance; thermodynamics; crystallography; calorimetry INTRODUCTION A significant obstacle to the efficacy of drugs directed against viral targets is the appearance of drug-resistant mutations in the targeted molecules. The clinical use of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in antiretroviral therapies clearly illustrates the capacity of the virus to mutate and develop strains carrying mutant protease molecules with a significantly lower affinity for the inhibitors while maintaining sufficient catalytic activity for viral reproduction.1­9 To be effective against a wide spectrum of protease variants, an inhibitor needs to exhibit an extremely high activity against wild-type protease and be affected only mildly by protease mutations. Ideally, an inhibitor should have a binding affinity in the 1­50 pM range against the wild type and be affected by mutations by a factor of 100 or less.10 ­12 The extremely high activity required against the wild type can only be achieved if both enthalpy and entropy contribute favorably to the Gibbs energy. In this article we describe the high resolution crystallographic structures of the complexes of two chemically and structurally similar HIV-1 protease inhibitors (KNI-764 and KNI-577) with the wild type HIV-1 protease and a common mutation associated with drug resistance to protease inhibitors currently in clinical use (V82F/I84V). Both inhibitors bind to the wild-type HIV-1 protease with high affinity but respond differently to the mutation.10 Despite their chemical and structural similarities, KNI-577 loses binding affinity by a factor of 200 while KNI-764 loses binding affinity only by a factor of 20.10 By combining high resolution structural data with binding thermodynamic results for both inhibitors against wild type and mutant protease, we attempt to understand the mechanism by

which an inhibitor can evade the negative effects of mutations. This mechanism could delineate a general strategy for the design of drug molecules that are more resistant to the effect of target mutations. METHODS Protein Purification Protease expression, purification and refolding were performed as described before.25,26 Briefly, plasmidencoded HIV-1 protease was expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were suspended in extraction buffer (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-ME, pH 7.5) and broken with two passes through a French pressure cell ( 16000 psi). Cell-debris and protease-containing inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation (20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C). Inclusion bodies were washed with three buffers. Each wash consisted of re-suspension (glass homogenizer, sonication) and centrifugation (20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C). In each step a different washing buffer was employed: buffer-1 (25 mM Tris, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.5M NaCl, 1 mM Gly-Gly, 50 mM 2-ME, pH 7.0); buffer-2 (25 mM Tris, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.5M NaCl, 1 mM Gly-Gly, 50 mM 2-ME, 1M urea, pH 7.0); buffer-3 (25 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Gly-Gly, 50 mM 2-ME, pH 7.0). Protease was solubilized in 25 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM Gly-Gly, 50 mM 2-ME, 9M urea, pH 9.0, clarified by centrifugation and applied directly to an anion exchange Q-Sepharose column (Q-Sepharose HP, Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The protease was passed through the column and then acidified by adding formic acid to 25 mM immediately upon elution from the column. Precipitation of a significant amount of the contaminants occurred upon acidification. Protease-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated and stored at 4°C at 5­10 mg/mL. The HIV-1 protease was folded by ten-fold stepwise dilution into 10 mM formic acid at 0°C. The pH was gradually increased to 3.8, and then the temperature was raised to 30°C. Sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was added to increase the pH to 5.0, and the protein was concentrated. Folded protease was desalted into 1 mM sodium acetate at pH 5.0 using a gel filtration column (PD-10, Pharmacia) and stored at either 4°C or 20°C ( 2.5 mg/ml) without loss of activity over several weeks. After folding, the protease was estimated to be 99% pure. Activity of the refolded protein was assessed by active site titration, performed by isothermal titration calorimetry (VP-ITC, Microcal LLC, Northampton MA) as described before.11,17 Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were carried out using a high precision VP-ITC titration calorimetric system (Microcal Inc, Northampton, MA). The enzyme solution (10 ­20 M dimer) in the calorimetric cell was titrated with KNI-764, KNI-577 or acetyl-pepstatin (0.150.3 mM) dissolved in the same buffer (10 mM, DMSO 2% v/v). In displacement titration experiments (see below), inhibitors were injected into the calorimetric cell contain-

ing the protein pre-bound to a weak inhibitor (acetylpepstatin) as described before.11,12,26 The concentration of acetyl-pepstatin in the titration cell was 0.2 mM. Protein and inhibitor solutions were properly degassed and carefully loaded into the cells to avoid bubble formation during stirring. Exhaustive cleaning of the cells was undertaken before each experiment. The heat evolved after each ligand injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat due to the binding reaction between the inhibitor and the enzyme was obtained as the difference between the heat of reaction and the corresponding heat of dilution. Blank experiments were performed by injecting the inhibitor into buffer solution to confirm the absence of self-association effects in the ligand. The binding enthalpy was measured at two pH values (3.8 and 5.0) using several buffers differing in ionization enthalpy (acetate 0.12 kcal/mol, MES 3.72 kcal/mol, ACES 7.51 kcal/mol, cacodylate 0.47 kcal/mol, formate 0.05 kcal/mol, glycine 1.07 kcal/mol, cytidine 4.50 kcal/mol). The extension and contribution of protonation/deprotonation processes to the binding were assessed by determination of the pH-dependence of the binding enthalpy. The pH values were selected according to a previous work with KNI-272, another allophenylnorstatine-based inhibitor, which exhibits maximal and minimal proton release upon binding at these pH values.17 The binding enthalpy of both KNI-764 and KNI-577 showed no dependence on the ionization enthalpy of the buffer, indicating no net proton exchange under the conditions of these experiments. Displacement Isothermal Titration Calorimetry KNI-764 and KNI-577 are tightly-binding inhibitors (Kd 1 nM) of the HIV-1 protease, and therefore standard titration experiments do not provide accurate estimates of the binding affinity, even though the binding enthalpy can be determined with high accuracy. In order to overcome this impediment, calorimetric displacement titrations were carried out, allowing for the determination of the affinity and enthalpy of binding.11,12,26,27 In calorimetric displacement titrations, the high-affinity inhibitor is titrated into a protease sample pre-bound to a weaker inhibitor. Under these conditions, the apparent binding affinity of the tight inhibitor diminishes in a manner proportional to the affinity and free concentration of the weak inhibitor and becomes calorimetrically measurable. Two calorimetric titrations are required to solve the binding equations and determine the binding affinity and binding enthalpy of the tightly-binding inhibitor: the titration of the weak inhibitor into the protease and the titration of the high-affinity inhibitor into the protease pre-bound to the weak inhibitor. Analysis of the data was performed using software developed in this laboratory as described previously.11 The change in heat capacity, the temperature derivative of the binding enthalpy, was determined by performing titrations at different temperatures (Fig. 1). It can be calculated as the slope from the linear regression of binding enthalpy versus temperature.

KNI's, the ratio of fprotease to inhibitor was increased up to 1:10. Because the stock solution of acetyl-pepstatin ( 8 mM) was made in pure water, no DMSO was added to the reservoir. Crystals grew in 1-2 days at 4°C. Once double mutant protease crystallized with acetylpepstatin, a ligand replacement technique was employed to obtain crystals of double mutant with KNI-764 and KNI-577. Crystals of protease with acetyl-pepstatin were washed and soaked in drops made with equal volumes of precipitant buffer and KNI-764 or KNI-577 solution (at 1 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 2 mM NaCl). Again, DMSO was added in the reservoir to the same percentage as the one expected in the drops after equilibration ( 7%). Structure Determination Four different data sets (wild-type and mutant HIV protease with either KNI-764 or KNI-577) were collected to 2.0 Å resolution on a RAxis IV Image Plate system using a rotating anode source equipped with Osmic mirrors (Molecular Structure Corporation, Texas). Diffraction data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK.28 Autoindexing and consideration of systematically absent reflections revealed that the crystals belong to space group P21212, unit-cell parameters a 57.7 Å, b 85.8 Å, c 46.5 Å with two monomers in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement searches using the coordinates of the HIV protease from the crystal structure of the complex with inhibitor KNI-272 (PDB ID: 1HPX) as the search molecule yielded a clear solution. An electron density map, calculated with phases based on the protein only, showed well-resolved density that allowed fitting all portions of the inhibitor as well as the side chains of mutated residues. Models consisting of protein coordinates plus those of the inhibitors were refined using the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS)29 with a residual target that did not include non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Rebuilding and correction of the models was guided by A-corrected 2Fo-Fc electron density maps. R and R-free (calculated with randomly selected 10% of the reflections) were used to monitor refinement of the model.30 The quality of the structures was assessed with the program PROCHECK.31 The final refinement and model statistics are shown in Table I. Coordinates The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1MRW and 1MRX for the complex of KNI-577 with the wild type and drug resistant mutants, and 1MSM and 1MSN for the complex of KNI-764 with the wild type and drug resistant mutants, respectively). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Inhibitors KNI-577 and KNI-764 are highly potent inhibitors of HIV-1 protease with Ki values in the subnanomolar range against wild-type enzyme.10 At 25°C, KNI-577 and KNI764 bind to wild-type protease with Kd values of 0.2 and 0.03 nM respectively. Structurally, the two inhibitors are identical except for the functional group at the P2 position

Figure 1. Typical calorimetric titrations of KNI-577 (top) and KNI-764 (bottom) into a solution of HIV-1 wild-type protease. The experiments were performed in sodium acetate 10 mM, pH 5.0 and DMSO 2%. The experiments on the left panels were performed at 20°C and on the right panels at 30°C. Additional experiments at 25°C were also used to determine the heat capacity change for each inhibitor against each protease used in these studies.

Crystallization Crystals of HIV-1 protease WT were grown in hanging drops of equal amounts of reservoir solution (100 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 3 mM NaN3) and protein solution (6 mg/mL, 1 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 2 mM NaCl). Previously, the inhibitor (KNI-764 or KNI-577) was added to the protein solution from a concentrated ( 15 mM) stock solution in 100% DMSO to a final ratio of protease to inhibitor of 1:2. The drops were equilibrated against a volume of 1 mL of reservoir solution. DMSO was added to the reservoir to a final percentage equal to the one expected in the drops after equilibration ( 7%). Crystals grew in 1-2 days at 4°C. Direct attempts to crystallize the V82F/I84V double mutant protease with the inhibitors KNI-764 and KNI-577 were not successful. In order to overcome this difficulty, crystallization was made with acetyl-pepstatin under the same conditions as reported above for the protease WT. Because acetyl-pepstatin is a less potent inhibitor than the

(see Fig. 2). In KNI-577, this position is occupied by a symmetric t-butylamide group, whereas in KNI-764 the position is occupied by a larger methylbenzylamide group. In KNI-577, there is one rotatable bond between the amide and the t-butyl group, and in KNI-764 there are two rotatable bonds between the amide and the phenyl ring. Both inhibitors bind to the protease in a process favored by enthalpic and entropic interactions.10 At 25°C, the differences in affinity are due to the more favorable binding enthalpy of KNI-764 (2.9 kcal/mol) (see Fig. 1 and Table II), suggesting that this inhibitor establishes better interactions with wild-type protease than does KNI-577. KNI577 on the other hand, exhibits a more favorable entropic contribution to the Gibbs energy of binding than does KNI-764 (1.8 kcal/mol), but this is not sufficient to overcome the more favorable binding enthalpy of KNI-764. Analysis of the crystal structures of KNI-577 and KNI764 bound to wild-type protease reveals that a group of conserved water molecules at the inhibitor­protein interface (Fig. 3) plays a crucial role in establishing a tight atomic packing density within the binding cavity. These water molecules have been shown to be immobilized within NMR timescales in the case of another allophenylnorstatine (Apns)-based inhibitor.13 Also, because these water molecules establish important hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts between inhibitor and protein, they have been shown to contribute significantly to the observed binding enthalpy.14

Inhibitor Response to V82F/I84V Drug Resistant Mutation Despite their structural similarities, the two inhibitors respond differently to the same drug resistant mutation V82F/I84V. Figures 3 and 4 show the structures of the inhibitors bound to wild-type and V82F/I84V protease mutant. Previously, Reiling et al15 determined the structure of KNI-764 with a version of wild-type protease differing in six residues from the one reported here. Although the structures of the four complexes reported here are highly similar, small localized differences are observed among them (Figs. 3-4). In all complexes, both monomers (A and B) of the HIV-1 protease interact with the inhibitor. In the case of the complexes with KNI-764, residue 82 (monomer A) interacts with the phenyl ring of the inhibitor, and residue 84 (monomer A) interacts with the same phenyl ring as well as with the methylbenzylamide moiety. In monomer B, residue 84 interacts with the dimethylthioproline group, but residue 82 does not interact with the inhibitor. As a result of these interactions, the substitutions present in the mutant (V82F/I84V) bring about small but significant changes in both the position and the conformation of the inhibitor. The largest changes involve movements of the aromatic rings of the inhibitor. The rotation in the plane of the ring of the methylbenzylamide by about 25° results in displacements of several atoms by up to 1.3 Å. Displacements of the same magnitude are observed for the 3-hydroxy-2-methylbenzoyl moiety, and

Water molecules considered in the structure-based thermodynamic analysis are shown in red.

smaller changes occur for the phenyl ring in Apns and the dimethylthioproline moieties. In the complexes with KNI-577 all of the differences between wild type and mutant are smaller than those observed with KNI-764 with one exception: the displacement of the phenyl ring in Apns is significantly larger than in the other complex. In the rest of the structure, including the 3-hydroxy-2-methylbenzoyl moiety and the dimethylthioproline, the changes are in general less than 0.3 Å. The t-butyl group, which in KNI-577 replaces the methylbenzylamide of KNI-764, hardly moves at all compared to the large movement experienced by the methylbenzylamide of KNI-764. The effect of these structural changes on the differences in thermodynamic properties of the four complexes is discussed below. Thermodynamic Response to Drug Resistant Mutation KNI-764 and KNI-577 lose significant enthalpic interactions (2.3 and 2.6 kcal/mol, respectively) when facing the

drug resistant mutant (Table II). However, KNI-764 is able to partially compensate for the loss in binding enthalpy by a gain in binding entropy. When the effects of the enthalpy loss and the entropy gain are combined, it becomes evident why KNI-764 loses affinity by only a factor of 25 while KNI-577 loses affinity by a factor of 260. In absolute terms, KNI-764 maintains a nanomolar affinity against the drug-resistant mutant while the affinity of KNI-577 becomes close to 100 nM. In fact, KNI-764 inhibits the V82F/I84V drug-resistant mutant with an affinity similar to that of first-generation protease inhibitors against wild-type protease.9 ­11 The affinity of KNI577, on the other hand, weakens below the level required for effective inhibition. Isothermal titration calorimetric experiments performed at different temperatures (Fig. 5) indicate that the binding of both inhibitors is associated with a negative change in heat capacity. The magnitude of the heat capacity change is different for each inhibitor, and their response to the drug-resistant mutant is also different. KNI-764 exhibits a Cp of 360 20 cal K 1 mol 1 against the wild type and 390 15 cal K 1 mol 1 against the mutant. KNI-577, on the other hand, exhibits a Cp of 420 20 cal K 1 mol 1 against the wild type and 380 20 cal K 1 mol 1 against the mutant, i.e. the Cp value for KNI-764 decreases while the Cp value for KNI-577 increases. The solvent-accessible surface areas of KNI-577 and KNI-764 are 760 and 820 Å2 respectively, of which 598 and 657 Å2 correspond to non-polar surface. Upon binding to the wild-type enzyme, KNI-577 buries 573 Å2 of its nonpolar surface and 163 Å2 of its polar surface. KNI-764, on the other hand, buries 607 Å2 of its non-polar surface and 162 Å2 of its polar surface. Against the V82F/I84V mutant KNI-577 buries 558 Å2 of its non-polar surface, while KNI-764 buries 619 Å2. The amount of buried polar surface remains unchanged for both inhibitors. The actual increase in the non-polar surface area buried by KNI-764 against the mutant protein reveals the adaptability of this inhibitor by its capacity to bury itself deeper into the mutant binding cavity. At the thermodynamic level, this structural feature provides an important contribution to the compensating entropy change. The opposite effect is seen with KNI-577, which buries a smaller non-polar surface area against the mutant protease.

The loss in binding enthalpy against the mutant experienced by both inhibitors can be explained in terms of the loss of van der Waals contacts when the inhibitors, selected against the wild-type enzyme, face an altered binding cavity. The gain in entropy experienced by KNI764 could originate from several factors. An increase in solvation entropy would be consistent with the more negative heat capacity change observed with the mutant.16 Another potential source of compensation is an increase in conformational entropy. One can envision a situation in which the loss of interactions is accompanied by an increase in the conformational degree of freedom of ligand and protein, especially if the loss occurs in nonconformationally constrained regions of the inhibitor. In this respect we observe an increase in the crystallographic B-factors for the KNI-764/mutant complex, while the opposite is true for KNI-577. Structure-Based Thermodynamic Analysis The crystallographic structures and the thermodynamic data discussed here indicate that the partial compensation of the binding enthalpy loss with an actual gain in binding entropy provides the thermodynamic mechanism to escape the deleterious effects of the V82F/I84V drug resistant mutation, and that this behavior originates from the better adaptability of KNI-764 to the binding site distortions introduced by the mutations. Recently, a refined structural parameterization of the enthalpy change associated with the binding of small ligands was presented.14 Four set of parameters were considered to be important for a quantitative account of the binding enthalpy: (1) the interactions between ligand and protein, reflected in changes in solvent accessible surface areas for ligand and

protein; (2) the conformational change associated with binding; (3) the presence of water molecules at the protein­ ligand interface (a cutoff of 6 Å for completely buried water molecules was reported); and (4) any effects due to protonation/deprotonation associated with ligand binding. In order to assess whether the thermodynamic response can be explained quantitatively in terms of structure, a parameterization of the binding energy developed previously was utilized. If the parameters reported by Luque and Freire14 [ H(25) Hconf 7.35 ASAnp 31.06 ASApol] are applied to the four structures presented here, the results shown in Figure 6 are obtained. In all cases, the reported conformational enthalpy change ( Hconf) of 5900 cal/mol for the protease molecule upon binding was used.14 Protonation effects for these two inhibitors do not contribute significantly to the binding enthalpy, as demonstrated by microcalorimetric titrations performed with buffers having different heats of ionization (data not shown).17 According to the published report,14 water molecules at protein­inhibitor interface contribute significantly to the binding enthalpy. In the KNI-764 complex with the wild type, six water molecules are buried within 6 Å of the inhibitor (2, 5, 10, 27, 99, 148) while in the complex with the drug resistant mutant only 5 water molecules (11, 22, 47, 91, 111) are buried. In the complex of KNI-577 with the wild­type protease, five water molecules are buried within 6 Å (1, 5, 6, 49, 84), and the same number are found with the resistant mutant (6, 7 57, 87, 123). The water molecules that satisfy the published criteria are shown in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 6, the parameterization predicts the binding enthalpies within 1.4 kcal/mol of the experimental value. For KNI-577 against the mutant protease, the error is somewhat larger and amounts to 2 kcal/mol. In all cases, the loss of binding enthalpy against the

The changes in solvent accessible surface area include the contributions due to the water molecules at the protein/inhibitor interface. The number in parenthesis represent the changes in solvent accessible surface areas calculated without taking into consideration the water molecules at the protein/inhibitor interface. Hint is the intrinsic binding enthalpy assuming that the protease is in the same conformation in the free and bound states. The experimental enthalpy is calculated by adding the enthalpy corresponding to the change in conformation (5.9 kcal/mol) to this value. Ssolv and Sconf are the calculated changes in solvation and conformational entropy, respectively. Srt correspond to the loss of translational degrees of freedom and is approximated by the cratic entropy16. Gel is the coulombic contribution to the Gibbs energy16.

drug resistant mutant is correctly predicted. Each water molecule optimizes the atomic packing density between inhibitor and protein and contributes on the order of 1.2 kcal/mol to the binding enthalpy. Against the drug resistant mutation, KNI-764 loses one of the buried water molecules but is able to partially compensate for this loss by accommodating itself within the binding pocket. It ends up suffering a smaller enthalpy loss than KNI-577, which maintains the same number of buried water molecules with the mutant. The global changes in solvent accessible surface area are shown in Table III. These changes include the sum protein contributions, as well as those made by the inhibitor, taking into consideration the water molecules at the protein­

inhibitor interface. For comparison, the global changes calculated without considering the water molecules are also shown. It is clear that the inclusion of the water molecules makes a significant contribution, especially to the polar surface that is buried upon binding. It is also seen that against the mutant the enthalpy loss originates from a diminished number of polar contacts reflected in a loss in buried polar surface area coupled to a gain in buried nonpolar surface area. The larger error observed for KNI-577 against the mutant protease could be due to an overestimation of the number of water molecules buried at the interface. As a result of this error, KNI-577 is predicted to lose 1 kcal/mol less than KNI-764 against the mutant. In the

structure-based calculations presented here, we have applied rigid cutoff criteria derived from a statistical analysis of different protein­ligand complexes14 (completely buried waters within 6 Å of inhibitor), according to which KNI-764 loses one water molecule against the mutant but KNI-577 does not. If KNI-577 also loses one water molecule, the predicted enthalpy would be 2.6 kcal/mol, which is much closer to the experimental value of 2.1 kcal/mol. It seems that a critical factor required to calculate enthalpy changes from structure is an accurate determination of the number of buried water molecules in a complex. A statistical-based criterion like the one used here may not work in every situation since some water molecules may exchange with the solvent even if they are close to the inhibitor and appear to be completely buried from the solvent in the crystal structure. The binding of KNI-764 and KNI-577 is favored by entropic contributions to the Gibbs energy of 6.7 and 8.5 kcal/mol respectively. The overall entropy contribution is composed of two major terms, a favorable term associated with the desolvation of the inhibitors and some regions of the protein and an unfavorable term associated with the loss of conformational and rotational/translational degrees of freedom. In our calculations, the binding energy was approximated by assuming that the Gibbs energy associated with the closing of the flaps was very small. This assumption is supported by NMR data18 indicating that the flaps exist in rapid dynamic equilibrium and that the fully closed conformation is also present in solution. The solvation entropy change was calculated from the changes in solvent accessible surface as described before16 including a correction term for the new enthalpy parameterization, and is shown in Table III. Conformational entropy changes were calculated as described before16,19,20,21 and are also shown in Table III. According to this analysis, KNI-764 was correctly predicted to gain solvation entropy with the drug resistant mutant. Again, the error obtained for KNI-577 against the drug-resistant mutation is larger than the one obtained for KNI-764. The overall change in conformational entropy was calculated to be larger for KNI-764 than KNI-577. This is an expected result since KNI-764 has an additional rotatable bond and a larger interaction surface with the protease. For each inhibitor, the conformational entropy changes were predicted to be similar for wild type and mutant proteases within the error of the calculations. Overall, the structure-based calculations predict the binding thermodynamics of the inhibitor to wild-type protease with higher accuracy than to the mutant (Fig. 6

and Table III). Against the wild type, the error in G is 0.2 kcal/mol, whereas against the mutant it is 1.9 kcal/mol and always an overestimation. In our calculations, we have assumed that the conformational energetics of wild type and mutant protein are the same. In fact, this may not be the case. Previously, Todd et al9 determined that the native conformation of the V82F/I84V mutant of the HIV-1 protease is more stable than the wild type protease and if this difference is due to a higher stability of the open conformation it will lower the affinity of inhibitors by about a factor of ten or 1.4 kcal/mol. If this is indeed the case, the error in the structure-based calculation of G will go down to 0.5 kcal/mol and will be close to the one observed for the wild-type protease. The heat capacity values calculated from the changes in accessible surface areas listed in Table IV underestimate the experimental values, suggesting that other effects in addition to changes in solvation contribute to the observed values. Since linked protonation reactions are negligible, a reasonable alternative is the presence of a significant contribution associated with the change in conformation of the protease between the free and bound states. In the unbound state, the protease exists in a highly dynamic conformational equilibrium that defines a conformational ensemble characterized by significant fluctuations, particularly in the flap region;18 in the bound state those conformational fluctuations are significantly dampened.18 Since structural fluctuations are coupled to enthalpy fluctuations, these changes would be reflected in the heat capacity of the protease because heat capacity is proportional to the average square fluctuation of the enthalpy:22,23 Cp H2 RT

If the differences between the experimental heat capacities and those calculated from the changes in solvation are assumed to be due to diminished structural fluctuations in the bound state, a reduction of 5.4 kcal/mol in the width of the enthalpy distribution of the protease would be expected upon going from the unbound to the bound state. The typical width of the enthalpy distribution for a globular protein of similar molecular weight is on the order of 30 kcal/mol.23 While water molecules buried at the protein­ligand interface contribute significantly to the binding enthalpy, they appear not to contribute significantly to the Gibbs energy of binding. The enthalpy gain is compensated by

the entropic loss associated with trapping the water molecules within the protein structure. If the structurebased thermodynamic analysis is performed without considering the water molecules using a procedure described previously,16 the enthalpy is underestimated by 6-7 kcal/ mol; however, the Gibbs energy is calculated reasonably accurately (1.9 kcal/mol standard deviation). If the water molecules are included in the analysis and their entropy loss is considered an adjustable parameter, only a marginal improvement in the calculated Gibbs energy is obtained (1.3 kcal/mol), suggesting that the enthalpic gain is significantly compensated by the entropy loss of immobilizing the water molecules at the protein­ligand interface. Similar observations regarding the role of interface water have been made recently for antigen­antibody complexes.24 CONCLUSIONS The structural and thermodynamic information presented here describes a mechanism by which an inhibitor can minimize the effects of mutations conferring drug resistance. At the thermodynamic level, the detrimental effects of the mutation on the binding affinity are minimized by the phenomenon of enthalpy/entropy compensation. At the structural level, the thermodynamic response originates from the better adaptability of KNI-764 compared to KNI-577. The better adaptability of KNI-764 is due to the presence of an asymmetric functionality and an additional rotatable bond at the same position where KNI-577 has only one rotatable bond and a symmetric functionality. While inhibitor flexibility is important for adaptability, it must be noted that it should be located at positions facing variable regions of the target and that the asymmetry of the functional group provides a significantly larger number of alternate conformations that are able to establish strong interactions with the target molecule.
