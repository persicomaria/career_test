ABSTRACT The structure and thermal stability of a heterochiral decaoligodeoxyribonucleotide duplex d(C1m8G2C3G4C5LG6LC7G8C9G10)d(C11m8G12C13G14C15LG16LC17G18C19G20) (O1) with two contiguous pairs of enantiomeric 2¢-deoxy-L-ribonucleotides (C5LG6L/ C15LG16L) at its centre and an 8-methylguanine at position 2/12 was analysed by circular dichroism, NMR and molecular modelling. O1 resolves in a lefthanded helical structure already at low salt concentration (0.1 M NaCl). The central L2-sugar portion assumes a B* left-handed conformation (mirrorimage of right-handed B-DNA) while its ¯anking D4-sugar portions adopt the known Z left-handed conformation. The resulting Z4±B2*±Z4 structure (left-handed helix) is the reverse of that of B4±Z2*±B4 (right-handed helix) displayed by the nearly related decaoligodeoxyribonucleotide d(mC1G2mC3G4C5LmC G mC G ) , at the same low salt concentraG6L 7 8 9 10 2 tion (0.1 M NaCl). In the same experimental conditions, d(C1m8G2C3G4C5G6C7G8C9G10)2 (O2), the stereoregular version of O1, resolves into a righthanded B-DNA helix. Thus, both the 8-methylguanine and the enantiomeric step CLpGL at the centre of the molecule are needed to induce left-handed helicity. Remarkably, in the various heterochiral decaoligodeoxyribonucleotides so far analysed by us, when the central CLpGL adopts the B* (respectively Z*) conformation, then the adjacent steps automatically resolves in the Z (respectively B) conformation. This allows a good optimisation of the base±base stackings and base±sugar van der Waals interactions at the ZB*/B*Z (respectively

BZ*/Z*B) junctions so that the Z4±B2*±Z4 (respectively B4±Z2*±B4) helix displays a Tm (~65oC) that is only 5oC lower than the one of its homochiral counterpart. Here we anticipate that a large variety of DNA helices can be generated at low salt concentration by manipulating internal factors such as sugar con®guration, duplex length, nucleotide composition and base methylation. These helices can constitute powerful tools for structural and biological investigations, especially as they can be used in physiological conditions. INTRODUCTION The D®L reversal of deoxyribose chirality (Fig. 1) represents an interesting modi®cation of DNAs that can be useful for the improvement of our understanding of the structure and dynamics of DNA molecules. It can also help in the design of molecules more resistant to nucleases in the context of antisense and aptamer strategies. Previous studies have shown that homochiral L-oligonucleotides could assume reverted helicity (left-handed helices) relative to natural DNAs (1). However, the properties of heterochiral L-D oligonucleotides still remain largely unknown, although enantiomeric deoxy-Lnucleotides have been used to gain insight into the relationship between the local DNA conformation and the helical sense of a double helix (2). For instance, double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing a single L-residue are still able to form stable Watson±Crick base pairs (1,3). This is also true for the DNA duplex d(mC1G2mC3G4C5LG6LmC7G8mC9G10)2 with two contiguous L-residues in the middle of each strand (4). At neutral pH and in mild salt conditions, similar to physiological conditions, this molecule adopts an all-right-handed helix resulting from D-residues assuming the B-DNA form and Lresidues the Z*-DNA form (mirror-image of Z-DNA). The practical conclusion of this study was that L-residues can

phase or anion-exchange HPLC, and those having a purity >95% were combined, co-evaporated with water several times and converted to the sodium salt with 2Q Dowex 50 W (Na+ form). The ®nal purity was >98% as determined by HPLC analysis. CD and UV melting experiments CD spectra of oligonucleotide solutions (70 mM in 10 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.0) were recorded in a 1 mm path length cell on a Jasco J-810 spectrophotometer equipped with a refrigerated water bath. Spectra at different temperatures were recorded after a 10 min equilibration period. UV melting experiments were carried out on a Uvikon 931 (Kontron) spectrophotometer. The temperature of 1 cm path length cells was controlled by a Huber PD 415 temperature programmer connected to a refrigerated ethylene glycol/water bath (Huber Ministat). Annealing was performed by heating samples (7.5 mM oligonucleotide in 2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris± HCl pH 7.0) at 90°C for 2 h and gradually cooling them at room temperature. During experiments, the sample temperature was increased at a rate of 30°C/h and the absorbance was measured at 260 nm. The melting temperature was read at the maximum of the ®rst derivative of the UV melting curves. NMR spectroscopy NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance500 MHz spectrometer. Data were processed on a Silicon Graphics Workstation with the Felix 2000 (Accelrys) and XwinNMR (Bruker) software. Samples were dissolved in 0.4 ml of potassium dihydrogen phosphate±disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer at ionic strength 0.1 pH 7.1, and contained 1 mM EDTA. Concentrations were nearly 1.5 mM in duplex. For assignments of exchangeable protons, samples were dissolved in H2O buffer. Phase-sensitive NOESY experiments in TPPI mode using the WATERGATE pulse sequence (8) were recorded at the four different mixing times of 40, 80, 200 and 300 ms and acquired with 4096 complex data points in t2 and 800 points in t1, with a relaxation delay of 1.5 s, at both 20 and 30°C. For assignments of non-exchangeable protons, samples were lyophilised several times in 2H2O buffer and ®nally dissolved in 99.996% 2H2O. NOESY experiments were recorded at different mixing times (40, 80, 120, 200 and 300 ms) with a relaxation delay of 2 s at 20 and 30°C. A total of 2048 complex points were acquired in t2 and 512 real points in t1. Two-dimensional (2D) P-COSY and 2D TOCSY were also used for assignments of both exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons. 1H±31P experiments (9,10) were used for the phosphorus assignments, and PFG-PEP HSQC (11) for the carbon assignments. A table of the chemical shifts is given in the Supplementary Material available at NAR Online. NMR restraints Interproton distance restraints used in structure calculations were measured from NOESY experiments recorded at various mixing times in H2O and 2H2O. Adequate references for distance calibrations in H2O and 2H2O were taken into account Ê (12,13). Distances were classi®ed as strong (1.8±3 A), medium Ê Ê Ê (1.8±4 A), weak (1.8±5 A) and very weak (1.8±6 A) according

cooperate with D-residues to form a heterochiral right-handed helix. The stability of heterochiral right-handed helices is intimately related to an ef®cient base±base stacking and sugar±base van der Waals interactions. The absence of disruption in the chain of interactions contributes to maintain the helix stability at the BZ*/Z*B junctions (4). L-Enantioresidues in the Z* conformation allow such interactions to continue within the same groove of the DNA helix. Actually, the melting temperature (Tm) of the heterochiral oligonucleotide has been found to be only 5°C lower than that of its natural counterpart (4). To learn more about the range of structures which can be assumed by heterochiral oligonucleotides, we now focuse on the d(C18mG2C3G4C5LG6LC7G8C9G10)2 (O1) molecule. Relative to the previously studied d(mC1G2mC3G4C5LG6LmC7G8mC9G10)2 oligonucleotide (4), the new oligonucleotide, O1: (i) still presents contiguous enantiomeric CL and GL at its centre; (ii) has no methylation of its cytosines; and (iii) guanine at position 2/12 now bears a C8-methylgroup that has been shown to markedly stabilise the Z-conformation of short oligonucleotides, even at low salt concentrations (5). The properties of O1 were analysed by circular dichroism (CD), UV melting and NMR experiments, as well as molecular modelling. In the CD and UV studies, the stereoregular d(C1m8G2C3G4C5G6C7G8C9G10)2 (O2) was used in parallel to O1, as a reference molecule. Under mild salt conditions (`0.2 M NaCl), O1 resolves into a left-handed helix, Z4±B2*±Z4, while O2 keeps the right-handed helix (B10). Thus, the methylation of guanine at position 2/12 and the replacement of two contiguous D-residues by enantiomeric L-residues at the centre of the molecule are both needed to induce the Z-conformation in physiological salt conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligonucleotide synthesis 2¢-Deoxy-L-nucleosides were prepared according to slightly modi®ed procedures (6,7). Introduction of a methyl group at the C8 position of 2-N-isobutyryl-2¢-deoxyguanosine was performed by a free radical methylation method as described by Sugiyama et al. (5). Base-protected deoxynucleosides were dimethoxytritylated and further converted to the corresponding b-cyanoethylphosphoramidites according to standard procedures. Oligonucleotides were synthesised by means of a Model 381A (Applied Biosystems Inc.) DNA synthesiser (10 mmol scale). After deprotection with 30% aqueous ammonia for 5 h at 55°C, the crude oligonucleotides were puri®ed by anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE± Sephadex A25 (Pharmacia) column using triethylammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer (pH 7.5, linear gradient from 0.5 to 1.5 M) as eluent. Fractions were analysed by C18-reverse

to cross-peak intensities. Rotamer domains for backbone torsion angles a, b, g, d, e and z were determined using 1Hand 31P-NMR data, as previously described (13±15). Watson±Crick hydrogen bond restraints were added for the stem residues which were experimentally determined as canonically paired. The criteria were chemical shifts of imino protons and the network of nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) in the base pair. Hydrogen bond restraints are the distances from a standard Watson±Crick base pair between the two heavy atoms of the hydrogen bond with an uncertainty of Ê T0.2 A. For the terminal base pairs solely, an additional restraint was added, corresponding to the distance between the proton and the hydrogen bond acceptor. During the torsion angle and Cartesian dynamics steps, planarity restraints on the Ê base pairs were added with a weight of 25 kcal/mol/A2 as described in Kuszewski et al. (16). These restraints permitted a signi®cant propeller twisting of the base pairs to take place unhindered. Molecular dynamics protocol A molecular dynamics simulated annealing protocol driven by experimental restraints was used to solve the solution structure of the molecule. This protocol uses torsion angle molecular dynamics implementation in the CNS program (17). We started with DNA strands under extended conformations, using the CNS protocol generate_extended.inp, to avoid bias of a predetermined form (17,18). The dynamics was carried out in three stages (18). In the ®rst stage, we used dynamics in the torsion angle space: molecules were equilibrated at 20 000 K over 90 ps, and cooled slowly at 1000 K over 90 ps. Non-bonded interactions were described by a repulsive quadratic term and calculations Ê were performed under NOE, hydrogen bond (50 kcal/mol/A2) and dihedral (5 kcal/mol/°2) restraints. At the beginning of the cooling step, planarity restraints were added with a weight of Ê 25 kcal/mol/A2. The second stage involved Cartesian molecular dynamics consisting ®rst of a cooling step from 1000 to 300 K in 15 ps, followed by a 15 ps equilibration period at 300 K. The non-bonded interactions were described by Lennard±Jones potentials, and electrostatic terms were turned on. The force constants on dihedral angle, NOE, hydrogen bond and planarity restraints were the same as previously. In a third step, dihedral angle force constants were slowly increased from 5 to 50 kcal/mol/°2, during a Cartesian dynamics stage where the system evolved from 1000 to 300 K in a 9 ps period; this is followed by an equilibration period of 9 ps at 300 K. A total of 3000 steps of powell minimisation was then performed. Calculations were made 50 times; for each run, a different set of initial velocities was used. Charge calculation with ab initio method Charges of methylated nucleosides were calculated by ®tting of the electrostatic potential, through the Merz Kollman procedure (19). This involved the comparative DFT geometry optimisations of guanines, 8-methylguanine, 9-methylguanine, 8,9-dimethylguanine, guanosine and 8-methylguanosine, using the B3LYP functional set (20±23) along with the 6±31G* basis set (24). Amino groups of nucleic bases were checked to be pyramidalised and not planar. The two nucleosides were optimised in South and North

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION CD analysis CD spectra of heterochiral d(C18mG2C3G4C5LG6LC7G8C9G10) (O1) and of homochiral d(C18mG2C3G4C5G6C7G8C9G10) (O2) were recorded in buffers of varying NaCl concentrations (Fig. 2). The spectral features of O1 (Fig. 2A) are speci®c for Z-DNA molecules (1,27) whatever the salt concentration. Even in the absence of NaCl, the O1 spectrum displays two relatively weak bands of similar magnitudes at ~260 nm (positive) and ~295 nm (negative). The bands demonstrate a gradual symmetrical increase as a function of NaCl concentration re¯ecting an increase of Z-DNA. The spectrum of the stereoregular O2 at low salt concentrations (0±0.2 M NaCl) (Fig. 2B) contains a large negative band at ~255 nm accompanied by a smaller positive band at ~280 nm. These are features of the right-handed B-DNA. At high salt concentration (2 M NaCl), the O2 spectrum is typical of the left-handed Z-DNA. Sugiyama et al. (5) have concluded that m8G is a good inducer of Z-DNA, after having determined a mid-point at 0.03 M NaCl for the B®Z transition of a m8G-containing hexa-nucleotide d(C1G2C3m8G4C5G6)2. With the homochiral O2 decaoligonucleotide, that incorporates 8mG at the 2/12 positions, the mid-transition is observed at much higher NaCl concentration (largely >0.2 M), indicating that the length of the oligonucleotide and the position of the methylation in the sequence could in¯uence the transition. Actually, the comparison of O1 and O2 proves that in long oligonucleotides, Lnucleotides are needed in addition to m8G to produce the B®Z transition at low NaCl concentration. Temperature effects Temperature melting effects on O1 and O2 were studied by combining CD and UV spectroscopies. We have seen above (Fig. 2) that both oligonucleotides present CD spectra typical of left-handed DNAs in 2 M NaCl, 12°C. In Figure 3A and B, the DNA thermal denaturation is re¯ected by a gradual reduction of the CD signal at ~295 nm. The UV melting curves recorded at ~260 nm for oligonucleotide O1 and O2 at concentrations nearly 10 times lower than those used in CD experiments provide Tms of 64.7 and 69.7°C, respectively (Fig. 3C). Actually, the same 5°C difference has already been found between the Tm of the heterochiral molecule d(mC1G2mC3G4C5LG6LmC7G8mC9G10)2 and that of its homochiral counterpart d(mC1G2mC3G4C5G6mC7G8mC9G10)2 (4), indicating that the heterochirality does not disturb the helix stability too much. Thus, a global picture of the DNA double helix highly sensitive to punctual changes in the DNA chemistry and to experimental conditions can already be deduced from CD experiments. More information on the shape of the helix and on its local structures, including the ZB*/B*Z junctions, can be gleaned from NMR and molecular modelling studies.

These spectra are not shown. Identi®cation of the m8G methyl group, the only methyl present in the oligonucleotide, permits in turn the assignments of the m8G deoxyribose-H1¢ proton,

In the base±sugar H6/H8±H1¢ ®ngerprint region, the GpC and the CpG steps display very distinct patterns: base±sugar H1¢

A noticeable feature in the NOESY spectra is the appearance of very strong intranucleotide base±sugar cross-peaks for the guanine residues G4, G8, G10 (H8±H1¢) and m8G2 (Me8± H1¢). Intensities are similar to those exhibited by H5±H6 in the

give rise to two separate resonances, probably because the rotation of the amino group around the C2±N2 bond is considerably slowed down by the adjacent bulky methyl on the ring. All together, the CpG and GpC steps are involved in very distinct networks of connectivities, and the enantio-CLpGL step displays spectral features which clearly deviate from those of the other CpG steps. A sketch of the main NOE connectivities in oligonucleotide O1 is presented in Figure 5. These illustrate the differences between the CpG and the GpC steps and the particular behaviour of the C5LpG6L/G16LpC15L step. Phosphodiester and sugar conformations in the backbone. Analysis of P-COSY and NOESY spectra provides information about sugar conformation (12,28). In the COSY spectra, we found that 3J1¢2¢ > 3J1¢2¢¢ (implying a C2¢-endo sugar conformation) for cytosine sugars (except C5) and the reverse for guanine sugars G2, G4, G8 and G10 (implying an unusual C3¢-endo conformation). This observation is con®rmed by the presence of large J3¢4¢ and J2¢¢3¢ cross-peaks for the G2, G4, G8 and G10 residues, while these cross-peaks are absent or weak for pyrimidines (except C5). The NOESY data are in full agreements with these data. Accordingly, G2, G4, G8 and G10 were restrained to the C3¢-endo conformation and the G6, C1, C3, C7 and C9 residues to the C2¢-endo conformation. The C5 residue presents signs of conformational averaging and thus was not restrained. According to the 1H±31P correlation spectra, the differences detected on the base structures extend to the backbone phosphates. A ®ngerprint region (31P±H3¢, H4¢, H5¢5¢¢) is presented in Figure 6. The chemical shifts of phosphorus atoms are listed in the Supplementary Material. Among the nine phosphorus resonances, those six arising from the ®ve CpG steps and the G4pC5L step are found in a rather classical range (between ±3.5 and ±4.5 p.p.m.). The three remaining phosphorus resonances (G2pC3, G8pC9 and G6LpC7) are at low ®eld (at about ±2.5 p.p.m.), which is usually explained by an a or a z angle assuming the trans conformation (12,13). However, the observation of H4¢±31P cross-peaks (besides the common H3¢±31P cross-peak) for the GpC steps (except that of G4pC5L) and the C5LpG6L step indicates that the b angles and g angles of these steps occupy the trans domain and the gauche + domain, respectively (12,29). Molecular modelling Structure calculations. Starting with the two oligonucleotide strands in extended conformation, we performed 50 simulations applying different initial velocities. The 10 best structures selected on energetic grounds are presented in Table 1. Seventy-two percent (36 out of 50) of the structures have an overall energy better than ±600 kcal/mol and do not present Ê NOE violations >0.2 A. The r.m.s.d. for the 10 base pairs in Ê the 10 best structures was 0.83 A (relative to the average structure, Table 1), which represents a rather good structural de®nition given the conservative restraints used in the calculations. The minimised averaged helix taking into account the 10 best O1 structures combines a Z-DNA portion (base pairs 1±20 to 4±17), a B*-DNA portion (base pairs 5±16 and 6±15) and again a Z-DNA portion (base pairs 7±14 to 10±11). We obtain,

cytosine aromatic rings. Such cross-peaks are not observed for the guanine with inverted chirality, G6L. This residue is the only guanine to adopt the glycosyl trans conformation in O1, all the other guanines assuming the glycosyl syn conformation (12,13). Another remarkable feature concerns the unusually high®eld shifts displayed by the H2¢ and H5¢ resonances (~1.7 and ~2.6 p.p.m., respectively) of all the cytosines (except C5L). The high-®eld shift probably results from the particular van der Waals interactions taking place between the sugars of cytosines and the bases of the succeeding guanines in O1 (5). Particular NOEs and base pairings observed in H2O. The ®ngerprint region of imino protons connected to amino, aromatic and sugar H1¢ protons is presented in Figure 4. Chemical shifts are typical for imino protons involved in Watson±Crick base pairs (28) at 13.29 (GL6), 13.15 (G8), 13.09 (m8G2) and 12.82 p.p.m. (G4). At the same time, imino± imino interbase NOEs are detected for GpC steps, but not for the CpG steps. Together with the NOEs typical of Watson±Crick base pairs, we observe the three following inter-residue NOEs: H1(G8)±H1¢C7, H1G2±H1¢C1 and H1G4±H1¢C3. Their presence features the existence of large deviations from standard BDNA at the corresponding steps. Cross-peaks arising between the C19/C9 geminal amino protons at 8.24 and 6.88 p.p.m. and the m8G2/m8G12 imino proton at 13.09 p.p.m. are also detected. Amino protons of m8G

therefore, a left-handed helix with a Z4±B2*±Z4 alternation (Fig. 7). In the two Z portions, the sugars alternate the directions of their O4¢ atoms, thus generating a zigzag characteristic of the Z-DNA (27). In contrast, the sugars of G4/C17 and of the enantiomeric C5L/G16L and G6L/C15L base pairs belonging to the B* portion, have their sugar O4¢ atoms pointing in a unique and same direction, a feature belonging to B-DNA (here, B*-DNA). In the Z4±B2*±Z4 helix, the Z and B* portions can also be distinguished from the differences of base±base stackings and base±sugar interactions in CpG steps. The Z-DNA allows the

interstrand stacking of the cytosine bases and the intrastrand van der Waals interaction of cytosine bases and guanine sugars. For the central enantio-CLpGL step, a B-type (B*-type) stacking of bases is obtained. The torsion angle values of the best structures are given in Table 2.

In these oligonucleotides, the conformation of the central enantio-CLpGL step is dictated by the conformation adopted by ¯anking DNA portions, the conformation of this latter being itself highly sensitive to subtle chemical modi®cations, such as guanine methylation (O1). In the B4±Z2*±B4

helix, the base±base stacking and base±sugar interactions taking place in the B4 portions propagate to the whole helix thanks to the inversion of the sugar polarity at C5L and the passage of the G6L glycosyl bond into a syn orientation in the central enantio-CLpGL portion. These two operations that

generate the Z* helix are needed to compensate the effects introduced by the chirality inversion at the centre of the molecule and to keep the base orientation in the grooves. In O1, the methylated G2/G12 residue and the enantio-CLpGL step act together to induce the left-handed helix Z4±B2*±Z4, at low salt concentration (Fig. 8). In the Z-DNA portion, the base positions are inverted relative to the right-handed helix. This occurs in response to both the inversion of polarity of the cytosine sugars and the adoption of the syn form by the guanine residues, the latter transition being strongly favoured by methylation of the guanine at position 8 (1). These two operations are needed to preserve the base stacking in the convex major groove of Z-DNA; they are not necessary in the central B2* portion, as the change of the sugar chiralities results in an effect similar to that produced by the inversion of the sugar polarity at cytosine and the anti to syn transition of the glycosyl bond at guanine. Thus, at the Z±B* junction, the C5L residue can adjust its base stacking with the preceding 5¢G4 residue without changing its sugar polarity, while the G6L residue keeps the glycosyl anti conformation in order to optimise its interactions with its succeeding C7 residue. The arrangement of the G4pC5L step at the Z±B* junction of the Z4±B2*±Z4 helix is presented in Figure 9, together with the structure of the GpC step in B-DNA and Z-DNA helices. The particular arrangement adopted by the G4pC5L step in O1 allows the continuation of the base±base stackings and of the van der Waals interactions along the whole left-handed helix.

This continuation does not need the inversion of the sugar polarity and the glycosyl anti to syn conversion at the succeeding C5LpG6L/G16LpC15L step. CONCLUSION The most salient feature of these studies is that heterochiral oligonucleotides can easily stabilise into right-handed or lefthanded helices under physiological pH and salt conditions. Contiguous enantiomeric L-residues at the centre of selfcomplementary oligonucleotides can resolve into Z*-DNA (right-handed helix) or B*-DNA (left-handed helix), the result depending on the conformation of their ¯anking D-residues. If these assume the B (respectively Z) conformation, then the central CLpGL portion will adopt the Z* (respectively B*) conformation. Although results demonstrate that in our chimeric oligonucleotides, the conformation of the ¯anking portions dictates the conformation of the central enantio-CLpGL, and therefore the whole helical conformation, the problem of the helical sense of such molecules at low salt concentration is not yet solved. We have seen, for instance, that a simple guanine methylation is suf®cient to induce a left-handed helix, thus highlighting the high ef®ciency of subtle chemical modi®cations in the conformational change of chimeric oligonucleotides. Yet, how the effects are transmitted from the chemically changed position to the distant L-residues requires

Nucleic Acids Research, 2003, Vol. 31, No. 23 a detailed study with numerous heterochiral duplexes combining L- and D-DNA domains of different lengths and bearing guanine methylations at various positions. Finally, we believe that chimeric oligonucleotides can constitute good tools in the search for molecules targeting DNAs and RNAs and to decipher the local structures and binding mechanisms of DNAs. The left-handed strands formed at low salt concentrations can be used as aptamers to detect proteins that bind tightly to Z-regions in DNAs. More importantly, they can also be useful in the preparation of antibodies that speci®cally recognise left-handed helices.
