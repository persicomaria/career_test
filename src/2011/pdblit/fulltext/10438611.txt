Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is a mammalian di-ironcontaining enzyme that belongs to the family of purple acid phosphatases (PAP). It is highly expressed in a limited number of tissues, predominantly in bone-resorbing osteoclasts and in macrophages of spleen. We have determined the crystal structure of rat TRAP in complex with a Ê phosphate ion to 2.7 A resolution. The fold resembles that of the catalytic domain of kidney bean purple acid phosphatase (KBPAP), although the sequence similarity is limited to the active site residues. A surface loop near the active site is absent due to proteolysis, leaving the active-site easily accessible from the surrounding solvent. This, we believe, gives a structural explanation for the observed proteolytic activation of TRAP. The current structure was determined at a relatively high pH and without any external reducing agents. It is likely that it represents an oxidized and therefore catalytically inactive form of the enzyme.

Introduction
Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are acid metallohydrolases that contain a binuclear Fe(III)-M(II) center in their active site, where M  Fe or Zn (Doi et al., 1988; Vincent et al., 1995; Taylor & Widlanski, 1995; Rusnak et al., 1996; Barford et al., 1998). In mammals, these enzymes are also referred to as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases (TRAPs) (EC 3.1.3.2) or type 5 acid phosphatases (Vincent & Averill, 1990a). TRAPs are iron-containing, monomeric glycoproteins with a molecular mass of around 35,000 Da (Andersson et al., 1992). The deduced amino acid sequences of human, rat and mouse TRAPs show a high degree of identity with the mammalian members of the PAP family, e.g. uteroferrin (Uf) and bovine spleen PAP (EkRylander et al., 1991; Hayman & Cox, 1994; Cassady et al., 1993). Recently, EPR spectroscopic analysis of rat recombinant TRAPs (Ek-Rylander et al., 1997) have provided compelling evidence

that this enzyme belongs to the purple acid phosphatase family. Mammalian PAPs contain a Fe(III)-Fe(II) center, while a plant PAP from red kidney beans (KBPAP) instead has a Fe(III)-Zn(II) center (Beck et al., 1988; È Strater et al., 1995). The anti-ferromagnetically spincoupled binuclear iron center of the mammalian PAPs exists in two stable interconvertible states: pink, reduced, EPR-visible and enzymatically active, with a mixed-valent Fe(III)-Fe(II) cluster; and purple, oxidized, EPR-silent and catalytically inactive, with the binuclear pair as Fe(III)-Fe(III) (Doi et al., 1988; Vincent et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1992). In contrast, the plant enzyme with a mixedvalent Fe(III)-Zn(II) center is constitutively active (Beck et al., 1984). The M(II) site in the PAPs can harbor either Zn(II) or Fe(II) without alteration of enzyme activity or spectral properties (Beck et al., 1984; Wang et al., 1996; Battistuzzi et al., 1997). KBPAP is the only PAP whose X-ray structure has È been reported (Strater et al., 1995). The active site of KBPAP consists of an iron and a zinc ion bridged by an aspartate residue and probably a hydroxide group. The Fe(III) site is coordinated by tyrosine, histidine and aspartate residues, while the Zn(II) site is coordinated by two histidine È and an asparagine residue (Strater et al., 1995; Klabunde et al., 1996). One solvent molecule is

However, an alignment of the sequences of Uf and KBPAP displays an identical positioning of the amino acid residues ligating the di-metal center (Klabunde et al., 1995, 1996). Moreover, the mammalian protein phosphatases calcineurin (type 2B) (Grif®th et al., 1995; Kissinger et al., 1995) and protein phosphatase type 1 (PP-1) (Goldberg et al., 1995; Egloff et al., 1995) both contain a di-nuclear metal center and also reveal a striking similarity to the plant PAP enzyme in the coordination environments of the active site, except for the absence of the tyrosine ligand. These two latter enzymes are serine/threonine protein phosphatases, suggesting that also PAPs function as protein phosphatases. A sequence motif, DXH(X)nGDXXD(X)nGNHD/E, incorporating most of the metal-coordinating amino acids found in the PAP and PP structures so far identi®ed has recently been identi®ed also in a large group of phosphoesterases, including other phosphomonoesterases, nucleotide phosphatases and nucleases, from plants, bacteria and animal cells (Koonin, 1994; Vincent & Averill, 1990b; Lohse et al., 1995; Rusnak et al., 1996). This phosphoesterase signature motif is represented at the secondary structure level as a b-a-b-a-b-fold that serves to position the two metal ions at the active site with four of the metal ligands provided by loop residues between each b-sheet and a-helix. The importance of this motif has been con®rmed by site-directed mutagenesis studies (Mertz et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1996). Furthermore, the PAP members are related to a superfamily of m-(hydr)oxo-bridged binuclear iron proteins, including hemerythrin, the R2-subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, methane monooxygenase hydroxylase and others (Andersson & È Graslund, 1995). All members of this superfamily of iron-oxygen proteins contain a binuclear iron center but have different functions. Among the purple acid phosphatases, uteroferrin is thought to serve a physiological role as an iron-transport protein in the fetal pig (Schlosnagle et al., 1974; Baumbach et al., 1986), whereas the role of spleen PAP is less well understood. The localization of splenic PAP to macrophage lysosomes (Schindelmeiser et al., 1987) as well as the catalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals by the enzyme (Hayman & Cox, 1994) may point to a role in oxygen-dependent degradation of phagocytosed material. In humans and rats, TRAP has been detected in a wide variety of tissues as a minor acid phosphatase isoenzyme; however, it is highly expressed in bone-resorbing osteoclasts (Ek-Rylander et al., 1991; Yaziji et al., 1995). This enzyme is a phenotypic characteristic for the osteoclast lineage and is used as a marker for late osteoclast differentiation (Andersson et al., 1992; Nordahl et al., 1998). The physiological role

of TRAP in bone resorption is still not known. A role for TRAP in the resorption of bone as well as cartilage breakdown in vivo is also indicated by the skeletal alterations observed in TRAP knock-out mice (Hayman et al., 1996). Bone TRAP can dephosphorylate certain bone matrix phosphoproteins such as bone sialoprotein and osteopontin (OPN) (Ek-Rylander et al., 1994), the latter is known as an anchor for the binding of the osteoclast via integrin receptors to the bone (Reinholt et al., 1990; Flores et al., 1992) This suggests that one potential physiological function of TRAP could be to regulate osteoclast attachment to or motility on bone. Ê Here, we describe the 2.7 A crystal structure of recombinant TRAP from rat in complex with inorganic phosphate. This is the ®rst three-dimensional structure reported of a mammalian purple acid phosphatase. The structure is compared with that of other metal phosphatases and implications for enzyme activation and catalytic mechanism are discussed.

Results and Discussion
The structure of TRAP The structure of TRAP can be described as a double b-sheet sandwich surrounded on both sides by a-helices (Figure 1) and has the overall fold observed for the C-terminal domain of KBPAP. The sheets have seven strands each and are mostly parallel and the di-iron active site is found at the C-terminal side of the sheets (Figure 2(a)). After cleavage of the 21 amino acid residue N-terminal signal peptide, the sequential structure begins with ®ve residues leading up to the ®rst strand (b1) in the middle of sheet 1. This strand constitutes the ®rst element in the conserved b-a-b-a-b motif. Asp14 on b1 coordinates Fe(III) and Asp52 on b2 coordinates both Fe(II) and Fe(III). A tyrosine sidechain, Tyr55, also coordinates Fe(III) and is responsible for the characteristic color of this enzyme, due to a charge transfer between Fe(III) and the tyrosine side-chain (Klabunde et al., 1996). The d-oxygen atom of Asn91 on b3 coordinates Fe(II). The sequence then adopts a helix-turn-helix structure followed by a ®nal strand on this side of the sheet, before crossing over to sheet 2. The strand b4 does not have a corresponding element in KBPAP. Sheet 2 begins with two strands, b5 and b6, connected by a short turn. Strand b6 is followed immediately by a short helix, a5. The region between Ser145 and Val161, which is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, is not visible in the electron density map. The density resumes at Val161 and leads to a6 and b7. At the C-terminal edge of b7 His186 coordinates Fe(II). The following loop contains two residues, Glu194 and His195, which is located close to the active site. The corresponding pair in KBPAP contains two histidine residues. The structure continues with two helices, a7 and a8, interrupted by a proline residue and followed

by b8. A short loop between b8 and b9 contains the last metal interaction site, where Ne of His221 and Nd of His223 coordinate Fe(II) and Fe(III) respectively. Sheet 2 continues with three antiparallel strands, b9-b11, before crossing over back to sheet 1. Three sequential and antiparallel strands constitute the C-terminal part of the structure. The last four residues, Arg303 - Pro306 cannot be observed. There is one disul®de bridge visible in the structure, between Cys142 on a5 and Cys200 on a7. The two cysteine residues are located on different sides of the observed cleavage site after a5 and agrees with SDS-PAGE studies with and without reducing agent, which suggested that the two substructures were connected by a disul®de (Ek-Rylander et al., 1997). There are two N-glycosylation motifs in the TRAP sequence. At the extension of the Asn97 sidechain extra density can be seen for one carbohydrate moiety, which has been included in the model (Figure 1(b)). No such density can be seen for Asn128. The exposed nature and high B-factors of that side-chain suggest that high mobility may be the cause for not observing glycosylation at this site. Comparison with other metal phosphatases There are three metal phosphatases for which crystal structures have been described in the literature. Those are KBPAP, PP-1 and calcineurin (also

known as PP2B). The similarity in fold between these proteins and TRAP is evident when the secondary structure diagrams of the catalytic domains are compared (Figure 2). Their bimetal active sites also superimpose, indicating a similar catalytic machinery (Figure 3). There are, however, a few differences in their overall structure that should be pointed out. KBPAP is a homodimeric protein and a large part of the dimeric interaction is made up of an antiparallel pair of strands from each molecule. This interaction is stabilized by an intermolecular disul®de. These strands are absent in TRAP and replaced by a hairpin loop between b9 and b10 (Figure 2(a) and (b)). Calcineurin and PP-1 have different connectivities for parts of the two sheets, when compared to TRAP (Figure 2(a) and (c)). Thus the N-terminal part of their catalytic domains begin with a strand in sheet 2 before crossing over to sheet 1 and the conserved b-a-b-a-b motif. Both sheets contain fewer strands than in TRAP or KBPAP. Calcineurin and PP-1 have an additional b-sheet of three antiparallel strands that is located close to the active site. The active site and catalytic mechanism The side-chains coordinating the iron ions in TRAP (Figure 4) all have their equivalents in KBPAP as predicted (Klabunde et al., 1995). When

a-carbon atoms (Figure 5). A large spherical density is visible near the two metal ions, which correlates with the size of a phosphate ion. The limited resolution of the data prevents us from establishing a proper orientation of this molecule, although the electron density suggests that the phosphate ion is located approximately equidistant from the two iron ions with distances between the phosphorous Ê atom and the Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions being 3.4 A Ê and 3.5 A, respectively, after re®nement. The distance between the two iron ions has been re®ned Ê to 3.1 A. We have modeled the phosphate ion to coordinate these ions in a bidentate mode and with

one phosphate oxygen atom forming a hydrogen bond with Ne of His195 (Figures 4 and 6). This orientation of the phosphate ion is similar to that found in the corresponding KBPAP structure (Klabunde et al., 1996). No solvent molecule in the active site can be modeled accurately on the basis of the present data. However, the structure does not contradict the hypothesis of octahedral coordination of the two metal ions as has been suggested for KBPAP (Klabunde et al., 1996). The missing density for residues between Ser145 and Val161 raises the question of proteolytic activation. SDS-PAGE indicated that crystallized

The alignment was performed in O (Jones et al., 1991).

Figure 6. A stereo view of the active site of TRAP with a superimposed Fobs À Fcalc electron density map. The resolution of the data does not allow for an exact orientation of the phosphate ion, for which only a large spherical density can be seen. It was instead rotated in such a way that the two iron ions were coordinated by one phosphate oxygen atom each with a third oxygen atom forming a hydrogen bond with Ne of His195. The density map was calculated around the amino acids, metals and phosphate of the active site, using a mask made by MAMA (Kleywegt & Jones, 1999).

TRAP had been cleaved into two fragments during the course of the experiment (data not shown). These fragments corresponded well in size to a cleavage of the protein in this region. We have observed that rat TRAP can be cleaved in this part of the sequence with a resulting increase in activity (Ljusberg et al., 1999). This region has been shown to be susceptible to proteolysis (Marshall et al., 1997). At this stage we cannot determine whether there is a single nicking of the enzyme or if a part of the sequence has been excised. A single cleavage site would give rise to two loose ends that could be too mobile to be detected in the electron density maps. We have labeled the region between a5 and a6 as the repression loop, since its cleavage or removal increases the activity of the enzyme up to tenfold. Ser145 is in close proximity to the active site and it is plausible that the uncleaved loop partly covers it and thereby interferes with activity. Interestingly, this loop domain is missing from KBPAP. The similarity of TRAP with the catalytic domain of KBPAP suggests a similar reaction mechanism for the two enzymes. Klabunde and co-workers have suggested a mechanism for hydrolysis of phosphate substrates by KBPAP, based on the crystal structures of this enzyme in unliganded form as well as in complex with the reaction product phosphate and with the inhibitor tungstate (Klabunde et al., 1996). They conclude that the phosphate substrate interacts with Zn(II) followed by a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom by a hydroxide ion coordinated by Fe(III). The negatively charged transition state is believed to be stabilized by Zn(II) and by the imidazole groups of three histidine residues, His202, His295 and His296, where the latter is also suggested as a potential proton donor to the leaving alcohol group. These histidine residues in KBPAP have their structural

counterparts in His92, Glu194 and His195 in TRAP. The side-chain of Glu194 points down into the protein and is not in close contact with the phosphate group, and probably has less of an effect on catalysis than His295 has in KBPAP. His92 and His195, on the other hand, superpose closely on their KBPAP counterparts. In EXAFS studies performed on mammalian PAPs (Wang et al, 1996; Merkx & Averill, 1998), the effects when Fe(II) is replaced by Zn(II) have been examined. Two possible locations of the nucleophilic hydroxide are proposed, one where it is coordinated to Fe(III) alone and another where the nucleophile makes a hydroxobridge between the two metal ions. It has been observed that small impurities of Zn(II) may account for residual activity in oxidized forms of the enzyme (Merkx & Averill, 1998). The Fe(III)-Fe(II) active site in TRAP may be susceptible to inactivation both by oxidation to an Fe(III)-Fe(III) form and by reduction to an Fe(II)-Fe(II) form (Doi et al., 1988; Beck et al., 1984, 1988). For the determination of the current structure, no special measures were taken to control the oxidation state of the metal center. For this reason we cannot conclude that this structure represents an active form of the enzyme. The high pH required for crystallization and the absence of reducing agents would instead suggest an inactive enzyme of the Fe(III)-Fe(III) form, far away from its catalytic optimum with regards to pH. A more exact description of catalytic mechanism and structural differences between various oxidation species must await higher-resolution diffraction data and crystals obtained closer to physiological conditions. In conclusion, the structure of rat TRAP, as a member of the mammalian purple acid phosphatase family, show a similar overall structural

208 organization and active-site structure as the purple acid phosphatase from kidney bean and the protein phosphatase family members 1 and 2B. The exact nature of TRAP activity regulation through proteolytic activation and redox environment control will be the subject of future studies.

Data collection Most X-ray data were collected on an in-house Raxis-4 imageplate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode, equipped with Yale focusing mirrors. A two-wavelength MAD dataset was collected on beamline BL14 at ESRF, Grenoble. All data collection was performed under cryoconditions. Prior to freezing, the crystal was transferred for a few seconds to a cryosolution containing two parts reservoir solution and one part glycerol. The space group was I41 Ê Ê with cell dimensions a  b  116.4 A and c  63.3 A. Ê The best crystal diffracted to 2.7 A resolution. Three distinct heavy-atom derivative crystals were produced, using Hg(CN)2/HgCl2, K2PtCl4 and Na2WO4. Heavy-atom derivatives were prepared by adding small volumes (approximately 0.1 ml) of saturated heavy-atom solutions to the crystal-containing drop two hours prior to freezing. The mercury solution contained equal amounts of Hg(CN)2 and HgCl2. The diffraction images were processed with DENZO and Scalepack (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996), conserving the anomalous differences for all datasets, including the native.

Methods
Protein production and purification Puri®cation of baculovirus produced recombinant TRAP was performed as described (Ek-Rylander et al., 1997). Crystallization The protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion with the hanging drop method. A number of different crystal forms were obtained although only one was suitable for X-ray studies. Common to all successful crystallization attempts was the presence of inorganic phosphate. The crystals used in the structure determination were grown with a reservoir containing 16 % (w/v) PEG 8000, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.1 M KH2PO4. The drop consisted of 2 ml of protein solution and 2 ml from the reservoir. The protein concentration was 5 mg/ml in 10 mM

Structure of a Mammalian Purple Acid Phosphatase Structure determination and refinement The strongest heavy-atom site for the mercury derivative was found by difference Patterson map analysis. The other sites were located using difference Fourier syntheses. Mlphare (Otwinowski, 1991) was used for heavy-atom parameter re®nement and MIR phasing at this stage. Anomalous difference Fouriers were calculated to con®rm heavy-atom sites and to identify the correct enantiomer. The phases were improved by solvent¯attening in dm (Zhang & Main, 1990) and the correÊ sponding electron density map to 3.5 A resolution was used for most of the structure interpretation. Later on, the programs Sharp (La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997) and Solomon (Abrahams & Leslie, 1996) were used to produce an electron density map of superior quality to Ê 2.7 A. A partial model of KBPAP was positioned into the density to facilitate chain tracing. The two highest peaks in the anomalous difference Fourier of the native data corresponded well with the positions of the two metalbinding sites in the positioned model of the kidney bean enzyme. A model of TRAP was built with O (Jones et al., 1991). È The re®nement was carried out with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) with a simulated annealing protocol, followed by conjugate gradient energy minimization and restrained isotropic B-factor re®nement. Bond distances between metal ions and liganded protein side-chain atoms were weakly restrained during re®nement. The progress of model improvement was monitored with Procheck (Morris et al., 1992). The model consists of all residues for mature rat TRAP, except a missing loop-region (residues 146-160) and the last four residues. After completed re®nement, the phosphate ligand was modeled manually by rotation around its center to have its oxygen atoms coordinate the two iron ions and make hydrogen bonds with His195. The assignment of oxidation numbers to the irons assumes an active enzyme with a divalent binuclear active site corresponding to that of KBPAP. The true oxidation state of the active site in the crystal has not been determined, due to a shortage of crystals. The R-factor is 23.4 % and the free R-factor is 28.1 % for re¯ections Ê in the interval 15-2.7 A: 80 % of the residues fall in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot as de®ned by Procheck. Data collection and re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
