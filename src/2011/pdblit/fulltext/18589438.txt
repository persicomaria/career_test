Abstract A genome wide search for new BH3-containing Bcl-2 family members was conducted using position weight matrices (PWM) and identified a large (480 kDa), novel BH3-only protein, originally called LASU1 (now also known as Ureb-1, E3histone, ARF-BP1, and Mule). We demonstrated that LASU1 is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinated Mcl-1 in vitro and was required for its proteasome-dependent degradation in HeLa cells. Of note, the BH3 domain of LASU1 interacted with Mcl-1 but not with Bcl-2 or Bcl-Xl. A competing BH3-ligand derived from Bim interacted with Mcl-1 and prevented its interaction with LASU1 in HeLa cells, causing elevation of the steady-state levels of Mcl-1. This suggests that the unliganded form of Mcl-1 is sensitive to LASU1-mediated degradation of Mcl-1. Ó 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

tion, such methods generally assume an equal importance for all amino acids positions, an assumption that limits their power since a gathering amount of position specific information is usually available for protein families. This is the case for the BH3 domain, as it is short and poorly defined at many positions, but also contains several highly conserved amino acids. Position weight matrices (PWM) provides the opportunity and flexibility to assign different weights to the amino acids in a domain, and therefore offers significant advantages to identifying novel BH3-containing proteins. Here, we describe the use of PWM to identity a novel large BH3-only protein, previously named LASU1. The identification of LASU1 was especially interesting because it contained a HECT domain suggesting a role in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation [6,7]. Given that pro-survival Mcl-1 is a target for rapid degradation [8,9], we focused our attention on its relationship with LASU1. Very recently this same protein was reported as an E3 ligase that can ubiquitinate multiple histones (E3Histone, [10]), p53 (ARF-BP1, [11]), and Mcl-1 (Mule, [12]).

1. Introduction Structural studies have revealed that the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family binds to pro-survival members by occupying a hydrophobic pocket formed by the close proximity of their BH1-3 domains [1,2]. To date a large number of BH3 domain containing proteins have been identified, and thus such a data set can be exploited in order to mine the genome for new candidate members. Homology detection methods have been extensively used in numerous quests to find proteins related to a query sequence and/or family of proteins. The advent of homology searching tools such as the BLAST [3] and FASTA [4] family of programs has helped tremendously in the discovery of novel apoptotic proteins [5]. However, such pair-wise alignment methods utilize information derived from a single protein/gene sequence and, therefore, might miss more distant relatives [5]. In addi* Corresponding author.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bioinformatics The sequences of a protein domain can be represented by a PWM, which captures the frequency of particular amino acids at each position within the sequence. Such a matrix is built from a set of known domain instances and can be used to scan a protein or genome database for new candidate domains. Given N instances of a domain D with sequences S1 . . . SN, each composed of n amino acids, we defined a matrix M of size n · 20 that summarizes the information about domain D. Let fB(i) be the background frequency for the amino acid i in the human proteome ([13], RefSeq version 4) and let fD(i, j) be the relative frequency of amino acid j at position i of the domain, for 1 6 i 6 n and 1 6 j 6 20. Then, the matrix score in column i and row j is   fD ði; jÞ . Mði; jÞ ¼ log fB ðjÞ To account for the fact that only a subset of all possible domain sequences are observed, a pseudocount a is introduced in the calculation of fD(i, j), which allows the prediction of domains that may contain certain amino acids that have never been observed yet at their respective n þaÃf ðjÞ position in known domains. We set fD ði; jÞ ¼ ij N þaB where nij is the number of occurrences of amino acid j at position i of the domain alignment D. A value of a = 1 is suitable. Observe that the smaller

5604 our sample size N becomes, the higher the chances that an amino acid that may not occur at a given position may still be found in an unidentified functional domain D, and fD(i, j) is adjusted accordingly. At the opposite, when N is large, fD(i, j) approaches the observed relative frequency. It is a common occurrence in a given dataset that an uneven amount of information is available for orthologous proteins, with some proteins being sequenced in more species than others. It is nevertheless desirable to include into the matrix as much of the available information as possible without diminishing the contribution to the matrix score from proteins whose orthologs are still not as well studied. Let F1 . . . Ff be the f orthologous families available for proteins containing P n domain D. Then, redefining nij ¼ k jFijkj, where nijk is the number of k occurrences of amino acid j at position i in family k, allows for all of the orthologous information of a given protein to be used while maintaining the correct contribution to the matrix score with respect to other proteins within the alignment. Once estimated from the known domains, the matrix M is then used to scan candidate proteins. For each candidate peptide X1 . . . XN of length N of each candidate protein, a domain score is calculated as P scoreðX 1 . . . X N Þ ¼ i¼1...N Mði; X i Þ. The score reported for a given protein is then the score of its highest scoring peptide.

Antibodies and reagents The following antibodies were used: a-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma); a-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma); rabbit a-Mcl-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit a-LASU1 antibody [10]; mouse a-actin monoclonal antibody (ICN pharmaceuticals); rabbit a-Tom20 antibody [14]. MG132 and lactacystin were obtained from Calbiochem, and Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Enzyme System Products. siGenome SMART poolR reagent for human LASU1 (XM_497119) was purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Luciferase GL3 Duplex was also purchased which corresponds to a region within the luciferase gene of the pGL3 plasmid for use as a negative control [15]. 2.3. Plasmid DNAs LASU1 specific primers were employed to generate by PCR a fragment spanning amino acids 1705­2063 of LASU1 cDNA with a Flag sequence at the C-terminus (designated N-LASU1-Flag) and cloned into pcDNA3.1. The BH3 domain of N-LASU1-Flag was deleted (N-LASU1(DBH3)-Flag) by removing amino acids 1976­1990 and mutated (N-LASU1(mtBH3)-flag) by converting the codons for leucine residues at positions 1979 and 1980 to glycine.

M.R. Warr et al. / FEBS Letters 579 (2005) 5603­5608 1 and Bik sequences were generated by PCR with a NH2-terminal Flag sequence and were cloned into pcDNA3. Bim(BH3) sequence (MRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNA) was generated by PCR and cloned into a pCDNA3 vector previously modified to express an NH2-terminal HA-MBP (maltose binding protein). HA-Bim(mtBH3) was made by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid L(11)A and D(16)A (MRPEIWIAQEARRIGAEFNA). Full length Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and BclXl were generated by PCR using a primer with sequences encoding an NH2-terminal HA epitope and subsequently cloned into pRc/ RSV vector (with NEO). Vector expressing Flag-tagged Paip-I was a gift from N. Sonenberg (Mcgill University). Mcl1DTM(1-327) was generated by PCR and cloned into a pET29b vector modified to encode an NH2-terminal Flag epitope along with the existing COOH-terminal polyhistidine (His6) tag for purification. 2.4. Cell culture and immunoprecipitation HeLa cells were plated at 20% confluency in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml streptomycin and penicillin. 24 h later cells were transfected by Lipofectamineä (Invitrogen) according to manufacturerÕs protocol. 48 h later immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously [16] with the indicated antibody. 2.5. In vitro ubiquitination of Mcl-1 The reaction mixture contained the following in a final volume of 20 ll: 10 ll of purified LASU1 [10], 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 0.5 U of pyrophosphatase, 12.5 mM phosphocreatine, 2.5 U of creatine kinase, 50 nM E1, 250 nM UBC4-1, 50 lM MG132, 2 lM of ubiquitin aldehyde and 360 nM of purified recombinant Flag-Mcl-1-His6. Ubiquitin conjugation reactions were initiated with 23 lM GST-Ub (Boston Biochem.), incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and then stopped by 2 mM NEM. Reaction products were pulled down by Ni2+ beads and eluted with 350 mM imidazole and resolved by SDS­PAGE.

sequences from 25 different vertebrate species and assembled a PWM that is visually depicted in Fig. 1A. Employing this PWM, each of the proteins in the NCBI RefSeq database was scanned as described in Section 2, and the scores of the top hits are reported in the ``Gen'' column of Fig. 1B. Alternatively, we used matrices built exclusively from antiapoptotic proteins (``Anti'' column of Fig. 1B), from multiBH domain pro-apoptotics (``Multi'' column of Fig. 1B), and from pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (``Only'' column of Fig. 1B). Finally, we used a matrix similar to our general matrix but that only considers the most conserved positions of the domain, i.e., position 1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15 (``Cons'' column of Fig. 1B). Analysis of the results revealed that a protein previously unrecognized as a potential BH3-containing protein, UREB1/LASU1, exhibited relatively strong positive scores in all categories (Fig. 1B). In contrast to other pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bim, Bik, Puma, Bid), however, which scored well in the BH3-only category but poorly in the antiapoptotic and pro-apoptotic multi-domain categories, UREB1/LASU1Õs score was similar across categories. Moreover, its BH3-only score was weaker than all other BH3-only pro-apoptotics. Thus, it can be expected that the BH3 function of UREB1/LASU1 may be different than that of classical BH3only proteins. 3.2. LASU1 sequence Based on data from the NCBI, human LASU1 was predicted to encode a protein of 3360 amino acids; however, the first 40 amino acids were found to be miscoded and the protein is actually 4374 amino acids (gi: 60549639) with a molecular size of $480 kDa [10]. Domain analysis of this protein revealed three domains known to be associated with the ubiquitin degradation pathway: a C-terminal HECT (homologous to E6-AP C-terminus) domain [6,7], an UBA (ubiquitin associated) domain [17], and a WWE domain [18] (Fig. 2A) suggesting a role for LASU1 in targeting proteins to the proteasome.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Bioinformatics search for novel BH3-only proteins As presented in detail in Section 2, a position weight matrix (PWM) was used to seek proteins previously unrecognized to contain a BH3-only sequence. Through an intense literature review, we collected 76 BH3-containing published

3.3. BH3 domain of LASU1 selectively associates with Mcl-1 Because Mcl-1 is known to be regulated by ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation [8,9] the LASU1 BH3 domain could serve as a docking point for Mcl-1. To confirm this an NH2terminal Flag-tagged fragment of LASU1 (N-LASU1-Flag), and N-LASU1-Flag harbouring a BH3 deletion (N-LASU1(DBH3)-Flag) and mutation (N-LASU1(mtBH3)-Flag), were coexpressed with full length HA-Mcl-1. Mcl-1 exhibited an interaction with N-LASU1-Flag (Fig. 2B, lane 1), whereas this interaction was not seen for either the BH3-deleted or ­ mutated polypeptides (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). To assess the ability of the BH3 domain of LASU1 to interact with other pro-survival members N-LASU1-Flag was coexpressed with HA-tagged Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl. Again, a direct association was seen between N-LASU1-Flag and Mcl-1 (Fig. 2C,

lane 1), however, no association was seen with either Bcl-Xl, or Bcl-2 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). 3.4. LASU1 can ubiquitinate Mcl-1 To confirm that LASU1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Mcl-1, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay using purified bovine LASU1 [10] and recombinant Flag-Mcl-1-His6 lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain. The assay mixture contained E1, E2 (rat Ubc4-1/human UBCH5B), LASU1, Mcl-1, GST-ubiquitin, and an ATP regeneration system. Subsequent SDS­PAGE and immunoblot with anti-Flag to detect Mcl-1 (Fig. 3A) confirmed that Mcl-1 is a substrate for ubiquitination by LASU1. The detection of some faint higher molecular weight bands in the absence of LASU1 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) may reflect the ability of Ubc4-1 to ubiquitinate Mcl-

Fig. 3. siRNA knock down of LASU1 increases the levels of Mcl-1, which is a target of the proteasome. (A) E1, E2, and an ATP regenerating system were incubated in the presence or absence of purified bovine LASU1 [10], recombinant Flag -Mcl-1-His6, and GST-ubiquitin in a 20 lL reaction at 37°C for 1 h. Reaction products were recovered with Ni2+ beads. Proteins eluted with 350 mM imidazole were resolved by SDS­PAGE and the products visualized by immunoblot with a-Flag. (B) HeLa cells were left untreated (UT) or treated with 10 lM of the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or Lactacystin (LAC) and collected, lysed at the indicated time points, and proteins analyzed by immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. (C) HeLa cells were left untreated or transfected with 100 nM of either LASU1 siRNA or Luciferase (LUC) siRNA, collected at 72 h post-transfection, and lysates analyzed by immunoblot with the indicated antibody: * full length LASU1; ** degraded LASU1.

1; however, the presence of LASU1 dramatically stimulated the multi-ubiquitination of Mcl-1 (lane 4). 3.5. siRNA knock down of endogenous LASU1 increases the cellular levels of Mcl-1 Under normal conditions, the steady-state cellular level of Mcl-1 is subject to rapid turnover and degradation by the 26S proteasome [8,9], and thus inhibition of this ubiquitinmediated degradation would be expected to stimulate Mcl-1 levels in HeLa cells treated with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin as shown in Fig. 3B. A similar consequence would be expected if Mcl-1 ubiquitination is inhibited, since this is the signal that directs proteins to the proteasome. To test this, we employed RNA interference to knock down LASU1. siRNA directed against LASU1 caused the elimination of the majority of LASU1 72 h after transfection, whereas control (LUC) siRNA had no effect (Fig. 3C). The upper band represents full length LASU1 (*) and the lower band is likely a degradation product (**). Correspondingly, there was a significant increase in the levels of endogenous Mcl-1 in the LASU1 knock down cells compared to the LUC-siRNA and the untreated cells.

3.6. An Mcl-1 BH3 ligand inhibits interaction between LASU1 and Mcl-1 and stimulates Mcl-1 levels As demonstrated in Fig. 2B, the BH3 domain of LASU1 is capable of interacting with Mcl-1. Thus, it would be expected that a BH3-ligand can compete with LASU1 for this interaction. To investigate this a vector that expresses only the BH3 domain of Bim (HA-Bim(BH3)), a well documented binding partner of Mcl-1 whose interaction with Mcl-1 is strictly dependent on its BH3 domain [19,20], and a vector where the BH3 domain of Bim was mutated (HA-Bim(mtBH3)) were employed (Fig. 4A). Cells were transfected with a 5:1 (plasmid) ratio of HA-Bim(BH3) or HA-Bim(mtBH3) to Flag-Mcl-1 in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, to prevent caspase activation by excess BH3. As seen in Fig. 4A, anti-Flag co-immunoprecipitation indicated an interaction between Flag-Mcl-1 with endogenous LASU1 in HA-Bim(mtBH3)-expressing cells but not HA-Bim(BH3)-expressing cells (fourth panel from top). As expected, HA-Bim(BH3) but not HA-Bim(mtBH3) coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Mcl-1 (fifth panel from top). Similarly, anti-LASU1 immunoprecipitations resulted in a much greater recovery of Flag-Mcl-1 in the HA-Bim(mtBH3)expressing compared to the HA-Bim(BH3)-expressing cells

(A) HeLa cells were transiently transfected in a 5:1 ratio with vectors expressing peptides corresponding to either Bim(BH3)-HA or Bim(mtBH3)-HA and Flag-Mcl-1 and maintained for 16 h in the presence of 50 lM zVAD-fmk. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations with either a-LASU1 or a-flag antibody, the precipitates resolved by SDS­PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot with a-LASU1, a-Flag or a-HA antibody: * full length LASU1; ** degraded LASU1. (B) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the indicated vector in the presence of z-VAD-fmk, and 16 h later cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with the indicated antibody.

(bottom panel). Collectively, the findings presented in Fig. 4A confirm the BH3-dependent interaction between LASU1 and Mcl-1 in whole cell extracts. Importantly, however, the resulting inhibition of this interaction by the competing BH3 ligand also resulted in an increase in both transfected and endogenous Mcl-1 levels, which is shown in Fig. 4A (second panel from the top) and Fig. 4B (top panel), respectively. The results suggest, therefore, that occupation of the BH groove of Mcl-1 by a BH3-ligand can prevent the interaction of Mcl-1 with LASU1, resulting in increased levels of the protein. In conclusion, we have confirmed a recent finding [12] that LASU1/Mule is a BH3-only E3 ligase that can ubiquitinate Mcl-1. Both the bioinformatics analysis and the selectivity of the LASU1 BH3 for Mcl-1, however, suggest that LASU1Õs BH3 domain is somewhat unique. Moreover, competition of the interaction between LASU1 and Mcl-1 by a BH3 ligand resulted in elevated levels of Mcl-1. The fact that Mcl-1 is stabilized as a result of itÕs interactions with pro-apoptotics may explain recent findings that, unlike Bcl-2, which does not constitutively associate with Bax or Bak, Mcl-1 is found associated with Bak in normal healthy cells [9,21]. The results also suggest that dissociation of Mcl-1 from such binding partners would promote its LASU1-mediated degradation.
