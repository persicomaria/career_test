Abstract--A novel series of acyclic 3-(7-azaindolyl)-4-(aryl/heteroaryl)maleimides was synthesized and evaluated for activity against GSK-3b and selectivity versus PKC-bII, as well as a broad panel of protein kinases. Compounds 14 and 17c potently inhibited GSK-3b (IC50 ¼ 7 and 26 nM, respectively) and exhibited excellent selectivity over PKC-bII (325 and >385-fold, respectively). Compound 17c was also highly selective against 68 other protein kinases. In a cell-based functional assay, both 14 and 17c effectively increased glycogen synthase activity by inhibiting GSK-3b.

1. Introduction Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase composed of two isoforms (a and b) with high homology (ca. 90%) at the catalytic domain.1 GSK-3b plays a critical role in glucose homeostasis, CNS function (via the proteins tau and b-catenin), and cancer (via angiogenesis, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis).2 Inhibition of GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation should activate insulin-dependent glycogen synthesis, thereby mimicking the action of insulin to lower plasma glucose. Thus, inhibitors of GSK-3b would afford a novel mode of treating type II diabetes.3 Additionally, GSK-3 inhibitors have therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases, bipolar disorder, stroke, cancer, and chronic inflammatory diseases.4 A number of GSK-3 inhibitors with various degrees of selectivity against other protein kinases have been reported in the past several years.5 During the search for PKC-b inhibitors as potential agents for treatment of

diabetic complications and other disorders,3b;6 we identified a novel series of macrocyclic bisindolylmaleimides with potent (single-digit nanomolar IC50 ) dual inhibition against both PKC-bII and GSK-3b,7 indicating high homology (ca. 50%) at their ATP binding sites between these two enzymes. Replacement of both indole rings with 7-azaindole led to a series of macrocyclic bis-7azaindolylmaleimides as GSK-3b inhibitors.8 The compounds generally showed excellent selectivity against a broad panel of about 60 protein kinases; however, achieving high selectivity over PKC-bII proved to be a challenge. Of the many macrocyclic bis-7-azaindolylmaleimides prepared,8 only one compound with a tetra(ethylene glycol)-linked 22-membered ring exhibited good selectivity for GSK-3b over PKC-bII (>200fold).8a We were interested in expanding on this foundation. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel series of acyclic 3-(7-azaindolyl)-4(aryl/heteroaryl)maleimides as potent GSK-3b inhibitors with excellent selectivity over PKC-bII (>300-fold), as well as a broad panel of other kinases. 2.

ethylmagnesium bromide followed by acylation with methyl oxalyl chloride (Scheme 1). N-Alkylation of 2 with iodoethane in the presence of Cs2 CO3 in DMF afforded intermediate 3, which was reduced with Et3 SiH in CF3 CO2 H (TFA) at 55 °C to provide methyl ester 4. Aminolysis of ester 4 gave amide 5. Compound 2 was also N-alkylated with 3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)propyl bromide to give a-keto ester 6. Maleimide condensation of 6 and amide 5 proceeded smoothly in the presence of t-BuOK at 0 °C.9 Treatment with concd HCl removed the silyl group to yield acyclic bis-7-azaindolylmaleimide 7. a-Keto ester 6 was also subjected to maleimide condensation with various commercially available arylacetamides 8, following the same procedure as described above, to afford target compounds 9a­f (Scheme 2).10 The hydroxy group in 9 was further converted to the corresponding amine. Thus, treatment of 9 with Ms2 O in pyridine/THF at 50 °C selectively produced O-sulfonated product 10 with no detectable N-sulfonated isomer. Substitution of the mesylate group in 10 with excess of dimethylamine in THF afforded aminecontaining products 11a,b. Alkylation of 2 with Boc-protected 3-bromopropylamine using Cs2 CO3 as a base gave intermediate 12, which was then condensed with 2-methoxyphenylaceta-

mide 13 in the presence of t-BuOK followed by addition of concd HCl to derive maleimide 14 along with some 15 (Scheme 3). Deprotection of Boc group in 14 with TFA afforded 15. Further functionalization of the primary amino group in 15 was conducted with various reagents. Treatment of 15 with butyl formate in DMF at 80 °C afforded formamide product 16a. Reaction of 15 with sulfamide in dioxane at 80 °C provided 16b, and with methanesulfonic anhydride in the presence of pyridine afforded sulfonamide 16c. Thiophene- and pyridine-containing analogues 17a­c were synthesized from a-keto ester 6 and the corresponding heteroarylacetamides under the conditions described for 9a­e.

3. Enzymatic activity Since achieving high selectivity for GSK-3b over PKCbII proved to be the most challenging among the approximately 60 kinases screened with the macrocyclic maleimide compounds,7;8 the 3-(7-azaindolyl)-4-(aryl/ heteroaryl)maleimides were tested in enzymatic assays involving both GSK-3b and PKC-bII to determine potency and selectivity between the two key kinases

(Table 1). In addition, these compounds were also screened against PKC-a and PKC-c, two isozymes within the same PKC subfamily as PKC-bII. Bis-7azaindolylmaleimide 7 inhibited GSK-3b and PKC-bII with IC50 values of 0.065 and 1.07 lM, respectively, and

was highly selective over PKC-a and PKC-c (IC50 > 10 lM). The selectivity for GSK-3b over PKCbII with 7 decreased when compared to the corresponding macrocyclic bis-7-azaindolylmaleimides.8 Replacement of a 7-azaindole ring in 7 with a naphthyl

(9a) increased the potency for both GSK-3b and PKCbII (IC50 ¼ 0.031 and 0.27 lM, respectively). Substitution of the hydroxyl in 9a with dimethylamino (11a) led to a 5-fold loss of potency for GSK-3b, while the potency for PKC-bII was maintained. Interestingly, replacement of the naphthyl in 9a with a 2-chlorophenyl group (9b) further improved activity for GSK-3b (IC50 ¼ 0.010 lM) as well as selectivity over PKC-bII (73-fold). Modifications on the phenyl ring in 9b led to single-digit nanomolar inhibitors of GSK-3b, 9d and 9e, which had excellent selectivity over PKC-bII, PKC-a, and PKC-c. For example, 9d inhibited GSK-3b with an IC50 of 0.004 lM and exhibited P360-fold selectivity versus PKCs bII, a, and c. Transfer of the O-methyl group from phenol to hydroxypropyl side chain in 9d (viz. 9f) caused an 11-fold drop in potency for GSK-3b; however, good selectivity versus PKCs bII, a, and c was maintained. Substitution of the hydroxyl in 9d with a primary amine (15) decreased the potency for GSK-3b by 9-fold. Introduction of various functionalities to the amino group in 15, such as carbamate (14), amide (16a), sulfamide (16b), and sulfonamide (16c), was well tolerated, giving potent GSK-3b inhibitors (IC50 6 0.020 lM) with various degrees of activity for PKCbII (IC50 ¼ 0.89­2.73 lM). The selectivity of this 7-azaindole maleimide series for GSK-3b over PKC-bII was further enhanced by replacing the phenyl with a thienyl (17a) or pyridyl group (17c), while maintaining potent GSK-3b inhibition. In this vein, pyridine-containing analogue 17c potently inhibited GSK-3b with an IC50 of 0.026 lM and showed excellent (>385-fold) selectivity over PKC-bII, as well as PKC-a and PKC-c (IC50 's >10 lM).

over the CDKs (25­62% of control). This compound was also highly selective over the remaining kinases in the panel, with very weak or no activity.12 To further determine the actual degree of selectivity for 17c, we obtained IC50 values (Table 3) for CDK1/cyclin B (5.8 lM) and CDK2/cyclin A (2.8 lM), as representatives for the CDK family, as well as MSK1 (>10 lM), which somehow failed during single-dose screening, reflecting GSK-3b selectivities of 220, 105, and >385fold relative to these kinases, respectively. We determined IC50 values for 9f and 14 against CDK1 and CDK2, representing the CDK family, and a few other kinases potently inhibited by 9f and 14 (Table 3). The very potent GSK-3b inhibitor 14 (IC50 ¼ 0.007 lM) also potently inhibited CDK1 and CDK2, with IC50 values of 0.17 and 0.068 lM, respectively.

5. Cellular activity Selected compounds 9f, 14, and 17c were tested for their ability to increase glycogen synthase (GS) activity in HEK293 cells, a direct functional assay to measure the cellular activity of GSK-3b inhibitors. The results in Table 4 indicate effective blockade of GSK-3b and increased GS activity within cells by these compounds, with EC50 values of 0.04­0.62 lM. LiCl, a known inhibitor of GSK-3b,13 was basically inactive in this cellbased assay, while another GSK-3b inhibitor reference compound, SB-216763,5k had an EC50 of 0.20 lM.

4. Kinase selectivity With potent inhibition of GSK-3b and excellent selectivity over PKC-bII achieved, we selected representative compounds for further screening against a broad panel of 70 protein kinases (Upstate Biotech Inc.) to assess kinase selectivity. Compound 9d, one of the most potent GSK-3 inhibitors, showed potent inhibition (<10% of control at 10 lM of compound in the presence of 10 lM of ATP) against PKC-bII, CDK1-6, and RSK3. In addition, some activity (<50% of control) was observed with 9d against other kinases, including AMPK, BLK, CAMK, CHK1, CK1, JNK3, LYN, MSK1, PDK1, PKC-a, PKC-e, PKC-h, PRK2, RSK1, and RSK2 (data not shown). Similarly, 15 and 16b showed poor selectivity and inhibited most of the kinases listed above (data not shown). Improvement of selectivity was observed with 9f and 14, where the number of kinases inhibited was greatly reduced (Table 2). It appears to be a generalized effect with this acyclic 7-azaindole-based maleimide series that the CDK family is potently inhibited in addition to GSK-3b and PKC-bII.11 With the macrocyclic bis-7-azaindolylmaleimides8 or bisindolylmaleimides,7 the GSK-3b selectivity relative to the CDKs was more easily achieved. Pyridyl compound 17c exhibited a significant improvement of selectivity

6. Molecular docking Given the X-ray structure of GSK-3b (pdb code: 1q3d),14 a molecular docking study can be performed to probe the possible binding mode of a GSK-3b inhibitor. Figure 1 illustrates 17c docked into the ATP binding site of GSK-3b.15 The key interactions for this complex include two hydrogen bonds between the maleimide portion of 17c to Asp-133 and Val-135 backbone carbonyl and amide hydrogen, respectively. The R1 hydroxyl group forms another hydrogen bond with Gln-185. The  azaindole nitrogen is only about 3.6 A from the carboxyl group of Asp-200 and may form an additional hydrogen bond depending on the protonation state of Asp-200. This binding mode is very similar to those revealed by recent X-ray structures of PDK1/bisindolylmaleimide  complexes.16 Thr-138 and Arg-141 are about 5 A from pyridyl group, and the electrostatic interaction between pyridyl and the positively charged guanidine is energetically favorable. In contrast, the two corresponding residues on these positions in PKC-bII are Asp-97 and Tyr-100. The electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged side chains and the pyridyl group is not energetically propitious. This difference may contribute to the excellent GSK-3b over PKC-bII selectivity for 17c.

7. Conclusion We identified a novel series of 3-(7-aza-indolyl)-4-(aryl/ heteroaryl)maleimides as potent GSK-3b inhibitors with excellent selectivity (>300-fold) over PKC-bII, the most difficult kinase among a broad panel to achieve high selectivity over with the previously reported macrocyclic

bisindolylmaleimides,7 or bis-7-aza-indolylmaleimides.8 Screening against a panel of 70 kinases revealed that this acyclic series potently inhibits the CDK family and has some activity against a number of other kinases. Introduction of a substituted pyridyl group led to potent GSK-3b inhibitor 17c, with a significant improvement in selectivity over the CDKs and excellent selectivity over the remaining kinases in the panel. Representative compounds, including 17c, were effective intracellularly, increasing glycogen synthase activity via the blockade of GSK-3b.
