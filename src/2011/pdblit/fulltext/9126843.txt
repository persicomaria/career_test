We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the complex of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase (18.3 kDa, 162 amino acid residues) formed with the anticancer drug methotrexate using 2531 distance, 361 dihedral angle and 48 hydrogen bond restraints obtained from analysis of multidimensional NMR spectra. Simulated annealing calculations produced a family of 21 structures fully consistent with the constraints. The structure has four a-helices and eight b-strands with two other regions, comprising residues 11 to 14 and 126 to 127, also interacting with each other in a b-sheet manner. The methotrexate binding site is very well de®ned and the structure around its glutamate moiety was improved by including restraints re¯ecting the previously determined speci®c interactions between the glutamate a-carboxylate group with Arg57 and the g-carboxylate group with His28. The overall fold of the binary complex in solution is very similar to that observed in the X-ray studies of the ternary complex of L. casei dihydrofolate reductase formed with methotrexate and NADPH (the structures of the binary and ternary complexes have a root-mean-square difference over Ê the backbone atoms of 0.97 A). Thus no major conformational change takes place when NADPH binds to the binary complex. In the binary complex, the loop comprising residues 9 to 23 which forms part of the active site has been shown to be in the ``closed'' conformation as de®ned by M. R. Sawaya & J. Kraut, who considered the corresponding loops in crystal structures of complexes of dihydrofolate reductases from several organisms. Thus the absence of the NADPH does not result in the ``occluded'' form of the loop as seen in crystal studies of some other dihydrofolate reductases in the absence of coenzyme. Some regions of the structure in the binary complex which form interaction sites for NADPH are less well de®ned than other regions. However, in general terms, the NADPH binding site appears to be essentially pre-formed in the binary complex. This may contribute to the tighter binding of coenzyme in the presence of methotrexate.

Structure of the L. casei DHFR-MTX Complex

Introduction
Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; EC 1.5.1.3) catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate to 5,6,7,8,-tetrahydrofolate which is an important intermediate in the synthesis of serine, methionine and thymidylic acid (Blakley, 1985). The enzyme is of considerable pharmacological interest being the target of a number of ``antifolate'' drugs such as methotrexate (MTX, an antineoplastic agent (see Figure 1)), trimethoprim (an antibacterial agent) and pyrimethamine (an antimalarial agent). Such drugs act by inhibiting the enzyme in parasitic or malignant cells. There have been several studies aimed at investigating the speci®city of the ligand binding (see for example Roth & Cheng, 1982; Baccanari & Kuyper, 1993) and extensive structural information has been obtained on a number of DHFR complexes from different species using NMR and X-ray crystallography (reviewed by Blakley, 1985; Freisheim & Matthews, 1984; Feeney, 1990, 1996; Feeney & Birdsall, 1993). For the enzyme from Escherichia coli, there are high-resolution crystal structures available on the enzyme alone (Bystroff & Kraut, 1991) several binary complexes (Bolin et al., 1982; Kuyper et al., 1982; Matthews et al., 1985a,b;

Bystroff et al., 1990; Warren et al., 1991; Reyes et al., 1995; Lee et al., 1996; Sawaya & Kraut, 1997) and ternary complexes (Bystroff et al., 1990; Sawaya & Kraut, 1997). X-ray structures have also been reported for complexes formed with the human (Oefner et al., 1988; Davies et al., 1990; Lewis et al., 1995), chicken liver (Matthews et al., 1995a,b; McTigue et al., 1993), Pneumocystis carinii (Champness et al., 1994), Staphylococcus aureus (Dale et al., 1997) and Lactobacillus casei (Bolin et al., 1982; Filman et al., 1982; Matthews et al., 1985b) enzymes. There has been a great deal of interest in monitoring loop and subdomain movements in dihydrofolate reductases, since several of these are believed to be functionally important. De®ning loop structures on the outside of proteins is dif®cult in crystal studies because of the possible structural perturbations from crystal packing forces. The most thorough investigations to date have been made by Sawaya & Kraut (1997) who addressed this problem by comparing different complexes crystallised in the same space group. However, it is clearly important to de®ne the structure and mobility of the important surface loops in solution. Several groups have published NMR signal assignments of complexes of the Lactobacillus casei

121 also help in interpreting NMR data from related complexes where the full structure has not yet been determined. Until now, our ligand docking studies in solution have had to use the X-ray structure of the ternary DHFR-methotrexate-NADPH complex as a starting structure. The solution structure reported here provides a more appropriate starting structure for use in such ligand docking studies. Finally, the availability of solution structures of protein complexes will allow us to de®ne the structures of loops on the outside of the protein and to compare their structures in different complexes unperturbed by crystal packing forces. In particular, we have examined the conformation of the loop comprising residues 9 to 23 (L. casei numbering) that forms part of the active site. This loop has been extensively studied in crystals where it appears to adopt different conformations in different crystalline complexes (Sawaya & Kraut, 1997).

(Carr et al., 1991; Soteriou et al., 1993), E. coli (Falzone et al., 1994), S. aureus (Altmann et al., 1997) and human (Stockman et al., 1992) enzymes. However, the only structures of DHFR complexes in solution reported to date have been obtained by using NOE-based distance restraints to dock ligands into the protein using X-ray structural data from a related complex as a starting point (Martorell et al., 1994; Morgan et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 1997). As yet there has been no complete structure determination of a DHFR complex in solution using NMR methods. Previous NMR studies have included determinations of binding sites and charged states of interacting groups in the complex (Cocco et al., 1983; Antonjuk et al., 1984; Birdsall et al., 1981, 1984, 1997; Bevan et al., 1985; Searle et al., 1988; Gerothanassis et al., 1996; Gargaro et al., 1996; Nieto et al., 1997), studies of dynamic processes in the bound ligands and their interacting groups on the protein (Searle et al., 1988; Birdsall et al., 1989a; Nieto et al., 1997) and characterisations of multiple conformations in several complexes (Gronenborn et al., 1981; Birdsall et al., 1982, 1989b, 1990). Many of these earlier NMR studies relied on using a combination of NMR results and X-ray structural data and hence assumed that the solution and crystal structures were similar. This assumption was supported by early NMR studies on DHFR which showed that the same elements of secondary structure are present in the solution and the crystal states (Carr et al., 1991). Further support for the assumption came when all the early signal assignments made by correlating NOE information with distances obtained from X-ray structures were shown to be correct when they were subsequently compared with assignments based only on NMR information (Carr et al., 1991; Soteriou et al., 1993). While these indications of similarity between the solution and crystal structures are encouraging, it is clearly important to determine the actual structures of DHFR-ligand complexes in solution since such structures will provide a more secure basis for investigating the speci®cities of ligand binding in solution. Here, we report the ®rst complete structure determination of a DHFR complex, L. casei DHFRMTX, using only NMR methods. This complex was chosen as the ®rst complex to study because it gave high quality spectra and its solution structure would allow us to make comparisons with the X-ray structure of the ternary complex L. casei DHFR-MTX-NADPH (Bolin et al., 1982) which is the only available X-ray structure for an L. casei DHFR complex. It also provides a reference structure for making comparisons with solution structures of other inhibitor complexes with L. casei DHFR currently being investigated to gain insights into the origins of ligand binding speci®city; these include the binary complexes of DHFR with trimethoprim and trimetrexate, and ternary complexes involving these ligands together with NADPH or NADP. The solution structure will

Results and Discussion
Signal assignments and NMR-determined restraints Many of the 1H, 15N and 13C signal assignments for the DHFR-methotrexate complex have been reported previously (Carr et al., 1991; Soteriou et al., 1993). These have now been further extended to include the assignments from Arg9, Arg31, Gln33, Lys37 and Pro53 and exchangeable protons from the guanidino groups of arginine residues and also many stereospeci®c assignments. More than 99% of the non-exchangeable protons have been assigned and a complete list of the assignments is provided as supplementary material. The distance restraints were obtained from NOE measurements and the dihedral angle constraints from coupling constant and NOE data as described in Materials and Methods. The complete structure calculations were carried out using a ®nal restraint list containing 2531 distance restraints, 361 dihedral angle restraints and 48 hydrogen bond restraints (the experimental constraints have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank; see Materials and Methods). The extensive list of intermolecular NOEs between the methotrexate and the protein protons is summarised in Figure 1. From an analysis of the ®nal 21 converged structures (see Figure 2) using PROMOTIF (Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996) a consensus secondary structure was identi®ed for the NMR ensemble. A representative structure Srep was selected from the ensemble of calculated structures as being the one which is closest to the average structure (Sutcliffe, 1993; Figure 3). The overall covalent geometry in the family of 21 structures is good (Table 1) and there are no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Figure 4). Superposition of the calculated structures (Figure 2) shows that the protein is well de®ned with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation about the average structure of Ê 0.46 A for the backbone atoms (C, Ca and N) and

Ê 0.82 A for all heavy atoms (see Table 1). A plot of the r.m.s. differences of the backbone atoms against the amino acid sequence (Figure 5) indicates that although all parts of the protein are well de®ned, the regions containing residues 16 to 18 and 64 to 72 are somewhat less well de®ned. In L. casei DHFR, the N and C termini are buried so that there are no long unstructured tails. The solution structure of the DHFR-methotrexate complex From the observed NOEs and amide proton exchange data (Carr et al., 1991), and the PROMOTIF analysis of the family of NMR structures, it is obvious that a large proportion of the secondary structural elements present in DHFR are b-sheet in nature. Examination of Figure 3 and the PROMOTIF output indicates that the structure has a twisted b-sheet formed from eight b-strands (residues 2 to 7 (A), 38 to 41 (B), 58 to 62 (C), 74 to 76 (D), 94 to 98 (E), 112 to 118 (F), 136 to 144 (G) and 153 to 160 (H); seven parallel (A to G) and one antiparallel (H) (nomenclature of Bolin et al.,

1982)). There are four a-helices (residues 24 to 32 (B), 43 to 48 (C), 79 to 88 (E) and 100 to 105 (F)) packed against the twisted b-sheet with two helices on each side of the sheet. The structure includes several b-a-b motifs as previously described (Carr et al., 1991). In 50% of the structures there are two other regions which interact with each other in a bsheet manner, one within the 9 to 23 loop (residues 11 to 14) and the other in the F to G loop (residues 126 to 127). These additional short b-strands will be considered later in the context of the movements of the 9 to 23 loop which determine the ``open'', ``closed'' and ``occluded'' forms of the binding site discussed by Sawaya & Kraut (1997). Evidence for helix capping (Presta & Rose, 1988) of helix B is found in the structures. In the majority of the initial structures (see Materials and Methods) calculated with no hydrogen bond constraints, the g-hydroxyl proton of Thr34 is close to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Phe30. A signal has also been detected for the g-hydroxyl proton of Thr34 which supports its involvement in a strong hydrogen bond. This interaction of the threonine residue hydroxyl proton with the phenylalanine residue carbonyl group would cap helix B. In the crystal structure of the ternary complex, these atoms are also close enough to form a hydrogen bond (Bolin et al., 1982). Figure 6(a) shows the pteridine binding site for the 21 NMR-determined structures. This shows that the side-chains of residues interacting with the pteridine ring are well determined. The 13C chemical shifts of the C2 carbon of bound methotrexate measured as a function of pH had previously indicated that the N1 position is protonated and that its pK value is increased by at least two units (Cocco et al., 1981; Cheung et al., 1993) in the DHFR-MTX complex. The methotrexate N1 proton is detected at a chemical shift of 16.85 ppm, and was assigned by its intramolecular NOEs. The detection of this proton and the modi®ed pKa value for the N1 position in the bound methotrexate strongly suggest that this proton is involved in a hydrogen-bonding interaction with a charged group on the protein. In the family of initial structures, the only nearby charged group Ê acceptor (less than 4 A away) is the carboxylate group of Asp26, with the next closest being more Ê than 8 A away. Thus the methotrexate N1 proton

is interacting with the carboxylate group of Asp26. PM3 SCF MO (self consistent ®eld molecular orbital) quantum mechanical calculations of the interactions between the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine moiety and aspartic acid residue in the active site of the protein indicated that the aspartic acid carboxylate group would interact with the N1 proton and a proton in the nearby 2-NH2 group (Polshakov et al., 1995a). The g-hydroxyl proton of Thr116 is also observed in the NMR spectra of the complex in H2O suggesting that it is involved in a hydrogen-bonding interaction with its nearest neighbour, namely Asp26. The interaction of Asp26 and Thr116 with the N1H and the 2-NH2 of the pteridine ring can be seen in Figure 6(a). This pattern of hydrogen bonding is identical with that seen in the crystal structure (Bolin et al., 1982). In the solution structure of the binary complex the L-glutamate a- and g-carboxylate groups of methotrexate interact with the Arg57 guanidino

group and the His28 imidazole group, respectively. These interactions were detected in our earlier NMR studies (Antonjuk et al., 1984; Gargaro et al., 1996) and in the X-ray work of Bolin et al. (1982). Recently we used 15N/1H HSQC spectra to characterise the interaction between the guanidino group of Arg57 and methotrexate (Gargaro et al., 1996; Nieto et al., 1997) and showed that there was a symmetrical end-on interaction of a ligand carboxylate group with the two ``inner'' NHZ guanidino protons (NHZ12 and NHZ22). However, we were unable to say if the interaction involved the a- or the g-carboxylate group. Ligand-protein NOEs used to determine the initial solution structures showed unequivocally that the a-carboxylate group of methotrexate interacts with Arg57. Although the values of the torsion angles in the L-glutamate part of the ligand are similar in the binary and ternary complexes, the w1 angle is not well de®ned in the solution structure of the binary

Ê the backbone atoms of 0.97 A (see Table 1 and Figure 7). The bound methotrexate was found to occupy a similar position in the binary and ternary complexes as shown in Figure 8. Thus, no major conformational change takes place in the protein when NADPH binds to the binary DHFR-methotrexate complex. A similar conclusion was reached by comparing crystal structures of the binary DHFR-MTX complex from E. coli and the ternary DHFR-MTX-NADPH complex of L. casei (Bolin et al., 1982). A PROMOTIF analysis of the binary and ternary structures indicates that strand E is two residues longer in the binary complex (94 to 98 rather than 96 to 98). The PROMOTIF analysis additionally identi®ed the two additional elements of b-sheet (residues 12 to 14 and 126 to 127) mentioned earlier; these are also seen in the PROMOTIF analysis of the ternary complex. The four a-helices identi®ed by PROMOTIF are identical in the binary and ternary structures. In our earlier work (Carr et al., 1991) it was suggested that helix B was one turn shorter in the binary complex but, with the more complete set of assignments now available, we ®nd that this is not the case. With regard to the coenzyme binding site it is noted that the loop comprising residues 64 to 72 (between b-strands C and D, see Figure 3) appears

to be less well de®ned than other loops in the structure of the binary complex. However, it is noted that the B-factors of atoms in the corresponding loop in the ternary complex (Bolin et al., 1982) are also generally large than those for other loops, and Epstein et al. (1995) have reported lower than average order parameters for residues 67 and 69 of the E. coli enzyme in its complex with folate. Several residues in this region make contacts with NADPH in the crystal structure of the ternary complex and it has recently been suggested that this loop may play a role in the negative cooperativity between NADPH and tetrahydrofolate binding (Basran et al., 1997). A detailed analysis of the solution and crystal structures shows that although the main differences occur around the NADPH binding site (for example, the backbone atoms of residues in the sequence His77 to Val79 in the binary complex are Ê displaced by about 2 A from their positions in the ternary complex) the main characteristic features of the NADPH binding site are essentially present in the binary complex. This is seen particularly clearly for the nicotinamide ring binding site given in Figure 9(a). This shows the structure of the residues that are known from the crystal structure to interact with the reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety of NADPH, together with the 21 NMR solution structures from the binary DHFRmethotrexate complex where there is no NADPH present. The positions of the backbone and sidechain atoms are seen to be well determined, and

The superposition of the backbone atoms (C, Ca and N) of residues 1 to 162 of the ®nal 21 structures of the L. casei dihydrofolate reductase-methotrexate complex was made onto the backbone atoms of the representative structure, Srep. The crystal structure of the ternary complex (shown in magenta) was superimposed on the Srep structure using the backbone atoms (C, Ca and N) of all 162 residues. The coenzyme (from the crystal structure of the ternary complex) is shown in ball and stick representation occupying the pre-formed binding site in the binary complex.

including a cis peptide bond. Figure 9(b) shows the environment around the vacant adenosine binding site. It is seen that while some of the residues have well-ordered structures (Leu62, Val79, I102 and Ala105), the side-chains for other residues are not well de®ned in the NMR solution structures (Arg43, Arg44, Thr63, His64, Gln65 and Gln101). To assess whether or not there is suf®cient space to accommodate this part of NADPH within the NMR structures we have analysed the possible unfavourable steric interactions between protein and coenzyme by using the BUMP routine within Insight. We have examined all 21 NMR structures with the superposed NADPH from the crystal structure (in this case, the superposition of the crystal structure was carried out using only the backbone atoms (C, Ca and N) of residues around the coenzyme binding site (5 to 7, 13 to 21, 42 to 48, 62 to 65, 77 to 79 and 98 to 105)). Most of the unfavourable steric interactions identi®ed could easily be removed by changing the conformation of the side-chains. For example, in several of the structures there is an unfavourable steric interaction involving the g-CH of Leu62. In fact, the w1 of Leu62 is 180 in the binary complex and À60 in the ternary complex. Similarly there are some structures in which there are unfavourable interactions with the side-chains of Arg43, Arg44, Thr63 and Gln101 (these are not well de®ned in the solution structure; their side-chains are essentially disordered as judged by their dihedral angle order parameters). These side-chains are all expected to make direct interactions with the coenzyme in the ternary complex and such interactions could be made by selecting out the appropriate side-chain conformations. The BUMPS calculations indicated that there are some unfavourable steric interactions involving protein backbone atoms and the coenzyme. These mainly involve residues Gly17, Gly99 and Ala100, but fairly modest moveÊ ments in the backbone (around 0.5 A) would be suf®cient to make the pre-formed site fully accessible to NADPH. Gly17 is part of the 9 to 23 loop which has been detected in different conformations in different complexes in the crystal state (Sawaya & Kraut, 1997). This loop will be discussed in more detail below. Active site loop conformations Sawaya & Kraut (1997) have examined an extensive series of binary and ternary complexes of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase formed with various ligands and they noted that the loop comprising residues 10 to 24 (loop 9 to 23 in L. casei DHFR) can exist in various conformations in the different complexes. They detected three possible conformations of the loop which they described as ``open'', ``closed'' or ``occluded'' forms with respect to the active site. A fourth possibility with the loop in a disordered state was also noted. The open form is the one most frequently observed in the crystal studies and in this form the loop extends

there is an appropriate space available for the coenzyme to occupy. The Ala6 backbone oxygen atom and its NH group are ideally positioned to form the two hydrogen-bonding interactions with the nicotinamide amide group as seen previously in the crystal structure of the ternary complex (Filman et al., 1982). The turn involving the conserved residues Gly98 and Gly99 also has a very similar structure in the binary and ternary complex

127 otrexate complex, the 9 to 23 loop is present as the closed form in solution. The b-sheet/hairpin is present and the hydrogen bonds between Gly14(O) to Asp125(N) and Asp16(N) to Asp125(Od2) exactly parallel the corresponding features seen for the closed form as described by Sawaya & Kraut (1997). In L. casei DHFR the residues corresponding to the hydrogen-bonded residues Asn18 and His45 in E. coli DHFR are Gly17 and Arg44; even though the latter pair cannot form a hydrogen bond similar to that seen between the E. coli residues, the overall similarity of the structure of the 9 to 23 loop in solution to the closed structures seen in other complexes is very clear (see Figure 10). Although there is no coenzyme present in the L. casei DHFR-methotrexate complex, the 9 to 23 loop shows no tendency to enter the nicotinamide ring binding pocket and to take up the occluded form. Clearly the closed form can exist in solution even in the absence of coenzyme. Thus there is no need to invoke crystal packing forces as destabilisers of the occluded form in some of the crystal structures where closed forms were observed in complexes with an unoccupied pocket for the nicotinamide ring.

outside its position in the closed and occluded structures (it is not an intermediate form between the latter structures). The closed form loop extends across the active site with the residues at the centre of the loop (16 to 19 in E. coli DHFR, corresponding to residues Lys15 to His18 in L. casei DHFR) forming a short antiparallel b-sheet and a hairpin turn which effectively seals the active site by forming a hydrogen bond between the Asn18 (Hd21) in the hairpin and the His45(O) in helix C. Further pairs of hydrogen bonds are formed between residues on this loop and residues on the loop between the F and G b-strands (Gly15(O) to Asp122(HN) and Glu17(HN) to Asp122(Od2)). In this closed conformation, residues in the loop also interact with the coenzyme nicotinamide-ribose moiety in crystal structures of DHFR complexes containing NADP. Sawaya & Kraut (1997) noted that the closed form is that seen in the crystal structure of the ternary complex of L. casei DHFR with methotrexate and NADPH (Bolin et al., 1982) and in all DHFR structures so far reported from sources other than E. coli. In the occluded conformation, the loop occupies part of the NADPH binding site and has a 310 helix instead of the b-sheet/hairpin. Sawaya & Kraut (1997) suggested that, in some crystal studies, the occluded form sometimes appears to be destabilised by crystal packing forces. A comparison of the solution structure of the corresponding loop (9 to 23) in the binary L. casei DHFR-methotrexate complex with the structure of the closed, open and occluded forms in the loop found in X-ray structures of other complexes (see Figure 10) indicates that in the L. casei DHFR-meth-

Conclusions
The comparison of the solution structure of the binary L. casei DHFR-methotrexate complex with the crystal structure of the ternary complex DHFRMTX-NADPH (Bolin et al., 1982) indicates that the vacant NADPH binding site in the binary complex is essentially pre-formed for NADPH binding. NADPH binds 700-fold tighter to the enzymemethotrexate complex than it does to the enzyme alone (Birdsall et al., 1980). If there is a difference in conformation or conformational ¯exibility of the enzyme in the absence of bound ligands, the preformed site in the binary complex could contribute in an important way to the much tighter binding observed in the ternary complex. However, a clearer view of the origin of the cooperative binding will only emerge when a solution structure is obtained for enzyme in the absence of ligands where any substantial conformational and ¯exibility differences between this and the liganded enzymes should become apparent. Three-dimensional structures for the enzyme alone and in its ternary and component binary complexes with coenzyme and substrate analogues will open the way to a more detailed understanding of binding speci®city and cooperativity.

The structure of the loop in the NMR solution structure of L. casei dihydrofolate reductase-methotrexate is labelled solution structure. The other structures (taken from Sawaya & Kraut, 1997) show examples of the closed, open and occluded forms of the loop found in crystal structures of several ligand complexes of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (complexes with NADPH-methotrexate (closed); NADPH (open); 5,10-diazatetrahydrofolate (occluded); Brookhaven PDB codes 1rh3, 1ra1 and 1rx5, respectively).

Materials and Methods
Preparation of samples L. casei DHFR was prepared and puri®ed as described previously using an E. coli strain into which the structural gene for the L. casei enzyme had been cloned (Andrews et al., 1985; Dann et al., 1976). The E. coli cells were grown in minimal media supplemented with

128
DHFR samples were uniformly enriched with 15N and 13C/15N by providing [15N]ammonium sulphate (C. K. Gas Products Ltd.) as the sole nitrogen source and [13C6]-D-glucose (C. K. Gas Products Ltd.) as the sole carbon source to the E. coli growth medium. Methotrexate was obtained from Sigma Chemicals Co. and the complex with L. casei DHFR containing one equivalent of methotrexate was prepared as described (Carr et al., 1991; Soteriou et al., 1993). NMR experiments All NMR experiments were performed on Varian UNITY spectrometers operating at proton frequencies of 500 and 600 MHz. The spectra were recorded at 281, 298 or 308 K on either unlabelled, 15N-labelled or 13C/15Nlabelled protein samples at approximately 3 mM concentrations in 500 mM potassium chloride and 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH* 6.5) (pH* values are meter readings uncorrected for deuterium isotope effects). As most of the assignments for this complex have been described (Carr et al., 1991; Soteriou et al., 1993; Gargaro et al., 1996) we will only discuss, in detail, the experiments recorded to obtained restraints for the structure determination. 2D NOESY (Jeener et al., 1979; Kumar et al., 1981) spectra were recorded in H2O and 2H2O with NOE build-up periods of 50 and 100 ms; ROESY (Bothner-By et al., 1984) spectra were acquired in 2H2O with mixing times of 15, 28 and 40 ms, respectively. 1D NOE difference spectra and 2D NOESY spectra recorded at low temperatures (5 and 1 C) were used to detect NOEs from the methotrexate N1 proton (16 Á85 ppm) to the protein. To identify other ligand-protein NOEs, a 12 C/13C ®ltered NOESY (Otting et al., 1986; Otting & È Wuthrich, 1990; Fesik et al., 1987) spectrum was acquired with a 100 ms mixing time (see Figure 11). Because
L-tryptophan.

Structure of the L. casei DHFR-MTX Complex unlabelled tryptophan was used in the fermentation (the E. coli strain being auxotrophic for tryptophan) this experiment also allowed the identi®cation of NOEs between ring protons of the unlabelled tryptophan and protons on the labelled protein. The following 3D 15N-edited spectra were acquired on the 15N-labelled sample: NOESY-HSQC, using a WATERGATE (Sklenar et al., 1993) version of the original sequence of Marion and co-workers (Marion et al., 1989a,b) with mixing times of 50 ms and 100 ms. Acquisition times were of 23.3 and 24.4 ms in the indirect 1H dimension, 16 ms in the indirect 15N dimension and 71.1 and 56.6 ms in the real-time 1H dimension, respectively. The ®nal size of the data matrix was 512 Â 128 Â 1024 real points in both cases; TOCSY-HSQC (Marion et al., 1989a,b), modi®ed to include WATERGATE solvent suppression, with acquisition times of 22.8, 16 and 71 ms in the indirect 1H, indirect 15N and real-time 1H dimensions, respectively, and a mixing time of 52 ms; TOCSYHMQC (Marion et al., 1989a,b), with a mixing time of 37 ms and a spin-lock power of 6.9 kHz with acquisition times of 9.7, 14.6 and 64 ms in the indirect 1H, indirect 15 N and real-time 1H dimensions, respectively, to give a ®nal data matrix of 256 Â 128 Â 1024 real points. The solvent signal was suppressed using a DANTE sequence. The SCUBA technique was used to recover signals of CaH protons near the water resonance (Brown et al., 1988); ROESY-HMQC (Clore et al., 1990), with a spinlock time of 30 ms, a spin-lock power of 3.7 kHz and acquisition times of 15 ms (indirect 1H), 11.5 ms (indirect 15 N) and 64 ms (real-time 1H), respectively. Solvent suppression was achieved by using presaturation of the water signal. The ®nal size of the transformed matrix was 256 Â 64 Â 1024 real points; HNHB (Archer et al., 1991), with a 38 ms delay to allow the evolution of longrange 1H-15N couplings, was recorded with acquisition times of 10, 13 and 64 ms in the indirect 1H, indirect 15N and real-time 1H dimensions, respectively. The ®nal size of the transformed matrix was 256 Â 256 Â 1024 real points; HNHA (Vuister & Bax, 1993), with acquisition times of 10 ms (indirect 1H), 28 ms (indirect 15N) and 64 ms (real-time 1H), respectively. Fourier transformation and zero-®lling resulted in a ®nal matrix of 256 Â 256 Â 1024 real points; HMQC-NOESY-HMQC (Frenkiel et al., 1990; Ikura et al., 1990a) with a NOE build-up period of 100 ms. Two 3D 13C-edited HMQC-NOESY (Ikura et al., 1990b; Zuiderweg et al., 1990) spectra were acquired with 100 ms mixing times and acquisition times of 10.0 and 9.1 ms in the indirect 13C dimension, 17.6 and 24.0 ms in the indirect 1H dimension and 56.9 and 68.3 ms in the real-time 1H dimension, respectively. The position of the 13 C carrier frequency was 40.8 ppm in the ®rst experiment and 74 ppm in the second experiment. The second experiment allowed the detection of NOEs between aromatic and aliphatic protons which were obscured by inef®cient decoupling of the aromatic signals in the ®rst experiment. After Fourier transformation and zero-®lling, the ®nal size of the matrix was 128 Â 512 Â 1024 real points in both cases. A 4D 13C/13C-edited NOESY (Clore et al., 1991; Zuiderweg et al., 1991) spectrum, 100 ms mixing time, was recorded with acquisition times of 5.3, 10.7, 5.3 and 42.7 ms in the 13C, 1H and 13C indirect dimensions and real-time 1H dimension, respectively. The spectrum was processed to give a ®nal data matrix of 32 Â 256 Â 32 Â 512 real points. The indirect 13C dimensions were extended by 25% using linear prediction.

Ê alanine and tyrosine rings. A further correction of 0.5 A was added to all NOEs involving methyl groups (Clore et al., 1987; Wagner et al., 1987). The number and distribution of NOEs used in the structure calculation is illustrated in Figure 12 and Table 1. The ®nal restraint list contained 2531 NOEs (protein-protein, 976 (long range), 376 (medium range), 583 (sequential) and 536 (intraresidue); protein-ligand, 54; ligand-ligand, six). No intraresidue NOEs between atoms separated by three bonds (e.g. HN-Ha, Ha-Hb) were included in the X-PLOR calculations because these (about 450 NOEs) had already been used for de®ning the torsion angles in the AngleSearch calculations (Polshakov et al., 1995b). No ambiguous NOEs were included in the calculations. Torsion angle constraints and stereospecific assignments Dihedral angle restraints and stereospeci®c assignments were obtained using the program AngleSearch (Polshakov et al., 1995b). The 3JHN,Ha coupling constants used in the calculations were measured from HNHA spectra (Vuister & Bax, 1993), the 3JN,Hb and 3JN,Hai À 1 were measured from HNHB spectra (Archer et al., 1991) and 3 Jra Yrb coupling constants were estimated from analysis of 3D 1H/15N TOCSY-HMQC spectra recorded with a short mixing time (37 ms) and from splittings in DQF-COSY spectra. The recently corrected Karplus coef®cients for 3JN,Hai À 1 were used for the estimation of c torsion angles (Wang & Bax, 1995). All interatomic distances used in the AngleSearch calculations were estimated from intensities in 3D 1H/15N ROESY-HMQC and 2D ROESY spectra (mixing time 30 ms). For residues containing only f, c and w1 torsion angles, typically six coupling constant parameters and nine distance-related parameters were included in the calculations of torsion angle ranges. No data involving overlapping signals were included in the analysis. A rotamer mixture model was used to analyse rotamer populations in side-chains from surface residues (Polshakov et al., 1995b). The error

The 1H carrier was positioned on the water resonance in all of the experiments. Decoupling during the detection period of the 3D and 4D experiments was achieved using the GARP-1 sequence (Shaka et al., 1985). Phasesensitive detection in the indirect dimensions was obtained using the method of States and co-workers (States et al., 1982). The spectra were processed and displayed using VNMR (Varian), FELIX (Molecular Simulations Inc.) and in-house software. The 3D and 4D spectra were processed with a 72 degree shifted sine-bell squared window function. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to DSS (after measuring from dioxane) and the 15N and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to liquid NH3 and TSP calibrated using the g ratios method (Live et al., 1984; Wishart et al., 1996). Distance restraints The interproton distance restraints were obtained from NOEs measured in the 2D NOESY and ROESY, 3D 1 H/15N NOESY-HSQC and 1H/13C HMQC-NOESY, and 4D 13C/13C edited HMQC-NOESY-HMQC spectra. The NOEs were divided into four classes, namely strong, medium, weak and very weak, corresponding initially to Ê Ê distance restraints of 0.0 to 3.0 A, 0.0 to 4.0 A, 0.0 to Ê Ê 5.0 A and 0.0 to 6.0 A. The last range allows for the inclusion of some spin diffusion effects in the cases where NOEs from 100 ms mixing time NOESY spectra were used (in fact, most of the NOEs were obtained from 50 ms NOESY or ROESY spectra). The lower Ê distance limit was explicitly set to 0.0 A to achieve improved sampling of conformational space in the initial simulated annealing calculation (Hommel et al., 1992). In Ê the later stages of the calculations a 1.8 A lower limit was imposed. An rÀ6 sum average, where the rÀ6 distance is weighted by the number of ambiguous NOEs (Nilges, 1995), was used for all non-stereospeci®cally assigned protons in methylene groups, for protons in methyl groups and the 2H ,6H - and 3H ,5H -protons in phenyl-

limits obtained from AngleSearch for the dihedral angles were increased to Æ30 for f, Æ50 for c and Æ40 for w1, w2 and w3, in order to take into account local mobilities and the uncertainties in the Karplus equations used in these studies. The ®nal restraint list contained 361 dihedral angles (f, 131; c, 128; w1, 95; w2, 6; w3, 1). Hydrogen bond restraints Hydrogen bond restraints involving backbone NH protons were included in the calculation only after they had been identi®ed in the family of structures using HBPLUS (McDonald & Thornton, 1994) and only where a corresponding slowly exchanging NH proton had been identi®ed in the spectra recorded in 2H2O. Two distance restraints were used for each hydrogen bond, 1.7 to Ê 2.5 A corresponding to the distance between the hydroÊ gen and the acceptor atom and 2.7 to 3.5 A corresponding to the distance between the donor heavy atom and the acceptor. In total, 41 hydrogen bond restraints involving backbone NH protons were included in the ®nal calculations. A further seven hydrogen bond restraints involving the ligand and/or residue side-chains were also included and the evidence for these is discussed in Results and Discussion. The only protein-protein hydrogen bond restraints involving side-chains which have been included in the structure calculations are the hydrogen bonds involving Thr116 and Thr34 g-hydroxyl protons formed with an Asp26 carboxylate oxygen atom and the Phe30 carbonyl oxygen atom, respectively. We also introduced hydrogen bond restraints into the ®nal re®nement to mimic the interaction of the a-carboxylate group of methotrexate with Arg57 (Gargaro et al., 1996; Nieto et al., 1997) and the g-carboxylate group of methotrexate with His28 Nd1 (Antonjuk et al., 1984; Birdsall et al., 1984) as determined previously. Distance restraints involving the methotrexate 1-NH and 2-NH2 interactions with the Asp26 b-carboxylate oxygen atoms were also included. The ®nal restraint list contained 48 hydrogen bond restraints. Structure calculations and structure analysis The structure calculations were performed on Silicon Graphics (Power Indigo2 and Indy) or Sun (Sparc 10) computers and the calculated structures were visualized using Insight (Molecular Simulations Inc.). For the complete structure calculation, the ®nal restraint list contained 2531 NOEs, 361 dihedral angles and 48 hydrogen bond restraints. No intramolecular NOEs were included in the calculation where atoms were separated by fewer than three bonds. The threedimensional structure calculations were performed in an È iterative fashion with X-PLOR 3.1 (Brunger, 1992; È Brunger et al., 1986) using the simulated annealing protocol of Nilges and co-workers (Nilges et al., 1988, 1991; Nilges, 1995) with minor modi®cations. In the ®rst instance, a set of 77 structures was generated using a simulated annealing protocol starting from an extended chain structure for the protein alone (Nilges et al., 1991). This involved 120 ps of dynamics at 1000 K followed by cooling to 100 K and ®nally 400 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. The ligand was then randomly translated with respect to the N terminus of each of these protein structures and subjected to a simulated annealing calculation similar to that described by Krageland et al. (1993). Essentially this involved a 3.0 ps

Structure of the L. casei DHFR-MTX Complex simulated annealing period at 1000 K, followed by cooling to 300 K and restrained molecular dynamics (3.0 ps) then 400 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. Ê Structures which had no NOE (<0.5 A) or dihedral angle (<10 ) violations after these two protocols were then accepted for further analysis. These initial structures were then used to resolve ambiguities in the NOE data set before being subjected to a slow cooling simulated annealing procedure within X-PLOR with more NOEs and dihedral angle restraints being added in an iterative fashion. The hydrogen bond constraints were only introduced at the very end of re®nement. This resulted in a ®nal data set of 21 structures which were selected as Ê having no NOE violations greater than 0.2 A and no dihedral angle violations greater than 5 . Bond lengths were constrained during the dynamics stages using SHAKE (Ryckaert et al., 1977). Parameter and topology ®les for methotrexate were constructed by using the methotrexate template structure provided with Quanta (Molecular Simulations Inc.) and converting the resulting output ®les into X-PLOR format. No information about partial charges was used in the calculations. These structures were then compared with the crystal structure of methotrexate tetrahydrate (Sutton et al., 1986) and crystal structures of DHFR complexes containing methotrexate to produce a consensus parameter ®le. The torsion angles for the bonds linking the substituents to the p-aminobenzoyl ring were constrained to be within Æ50 to the plane of the ring using dihedral angle restraints: in fact it is the NOEs which allow these angles to be well de®ned. The analysis of the 21 structures was carried out using È X-PLOR 3.1 (Brunger, 1992), PROCHECK-NMR/AQUA (Laskowski et al., 1993, 1996), PROMOTIF (Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996), HBPLUS (McDonald & Thornton, 1994) and MolMol (Koradi et al., 1996). The analyses showed that there are no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Figure 4). The structures and NMR-derived constraints have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession number 1AO8).
