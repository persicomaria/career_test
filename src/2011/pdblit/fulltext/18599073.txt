Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Uppal Road Hyderabad 500 007, India Variation in gene sequences generated by directed evolution approaches often does not assure a minimalist design for obtaining a desired property in proteins. While screening for enhanced thermostability, structural information was utilized in selecting mutations that are generated by error-prone PCR. By this approach we have increased the half-life of denaturation by 300-fold compared to the wild-type Bacillus subtilis lipase through three point mutations generated by only two cycles of error-prone PCR. At lower temperatures the activity parameters of the thermostable mutants are unaltered. High-resolution crystal structures of the mutants show subtle changes, which include stacking of tyrosine residues, peptide plane flipping and a better anchoring of the terminus, that challenge rational design and explain the structural basis for enhanced thermostability. The approach may offer an efficient and minimalist solution for the enhancement of a desired property of a protein.

Introduction
Though protein thermostability has been a subject of great interest for a long time, general methods for increasing protein stability are lacking.1 There has been extensive work on understanding protein stability by rational modification of protein structure.1­4 The method most often followed to predict stabilizing mutations is based on comparisons of mesophilic proteins and their thermophilic homologues.4­6 This approach is suited for proteins where the crystal structure of the target protein and that of a homologue is known. Moreover, many of the sequence differences in thermophilic and mesophilic proteins may have arisen either as response to a selection pressure other than thermal stress faced by the organism

during its evolution or by random genetic drift.6,7 This makes it difficult to predict thermostabilizing mutations solely on the basis of sequence and structure comparison. The efforts to increase protein thermostability were further confounded by plurality of the mechanisms evolved by natural enzymes to attain thermostability.1,4,6 The energy differences between a stable versus unstable proteins were found to be small, amounting to a few additional hydrogen bonds in the background of scores of hydrogen bonds in a protein.1,8 Comparative structural investigations on several protein families indicated any of ionic, hydrophobic and conformational changes could be engaged to render a protein stable.4,6 This is the primary reason why site-directed mutagenesis strategies have had limited success in the generation of thermostable mutants. Directed or in vitro evolution methods to impart non-natural properties to enzymes have found significant success recently.9­11 These strategies are based on delinking the enzyme property from its contribution to survival. Such approaches have allowed us to sample the physicochemical space of a protein instead of only its physiological space. Several proteins with special properties have been generated and also the methods required to perform such experiments have been fine-tuned.12,13

1272 Given the subtility in structure­function relations in protein thermostability, directed evolution methods are probably better suited for generating thermostable variants, since they sample a large sequence space in a shorter time. Significant enhancement in thermostability was achieved by directed evolution in several cases including p-nitrobenzylesterase,14 subtilisin E,15 subtilisin S41,16 b-gluocosidase17 and 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase.18 The screening protocols in most directed evolution methods employed to enhance thermostability are laborintensive and are primarily based on phenotype. These protocols are more difficult to perform on heterologously expressed proteins and due to complications arising from exposure of cell lysates to high temperatures during screening. Furthermore, if multiple mutations occur in one generation it is difficult to identify mutations that are beneficial from non-beneficial ones.7 To increase the chances of beneficial mutations among total mutations, we decided to use the structural information of the protein to exclude mutations that were not beneficial to thermostability in early cycles of error-prone PCR based on simple amino acid replacement rules and structural considerations. Lipases are used in several industrial processes and thermostable lipases are very important in the detergent industry and in organic synthesis.19,20 Bacillus subtilis lipase (Lip A), a product of the lipA gene with a mass of 19.34 kDa, is a monomeric protein without any bound ligand.21,22 Lip A preferentially hydrolyses C8 fatty acid esters and it is one of the three known lipases that do not possess interfacial activation. Two high-resolution crystal structures of Lip A have been reported recently.23,24 By using structural information for

combining mutations generated by directed evolution, we designed a triple mutant that has a 300fold enhancement in thermostability when compared to the wild-type. High-resolution crystal structures of the mutant lipases revealed local and subtle changes that challenge knowledge-based prediction of thermostabilizing mutations in a protein, and offer a structural basis for the enhanced thermostability.

Results and Discussion
Generation of thermostable mutants Thermostability of the Lip A was improved by combining error-prone PCR and site-directed mutagenesis approaches. The path of laboratory evolution and the mutations are depicted in the flowchart (Figure 1). In the first two generations of errorprone PCR cycles approximately 2000 colonies were screened. Mutants with significant increase in residual activity after incubating at 45 8C in the first generation, judged statistically, were taken forward. The error rate in the PCR amplification was found to be two to six changes per 1000 bases, based on the sequence information on the first generation variants. One clone, named 1-1E5, was identified as the most thermostable variant in the first generation and found to have the N166Y mutation. In the second generation, mutants 23E8, 2-3E9, 4B12, 2-8G10 and 2-3H5 were identified that had more residual activity in cell lysates than 1-1E5 and wild-type after exposure to 45 8C and 55 8C. Sequencing these mutants revealed the following changes 2-3E8 (N166Y,V71A), 2-3E9

1273 D144V, A68V, V71A and R147S were predicted to result in a non-polar group on the surface, bad van der Waals contacts, substitution of smaller residue in a hydrophobic region or loss of ionic interactions, and therefore excluded.25 Mutant lipases from 1-1E5, 2-8G10 and 2-3H5 were purified to assess the thermostability (Figure 1). The half-life of activity at 55 8C indicated significant increase in activity only in the case of 2-8G10 and 2-3H5 by seven- and threefold, respectively, over the wildtype and was lower than 1-1E5. Conversely, in lysate assays stabilities of purified 2-8G10 and 23H5 were 1.5 times and 2.5 times better than 1-1E5. This observation brings to the fore the mitigating effects of cell lysate-based assays. Based on comparisons of activity at 55 8C and the absence of destabilizing effects as observed using the structural information of the wild-type, we presumed A132D and L114P might contribute to the stability of lipase. On these premises we constructed a double mutant, DM (N166Y, A132D), and a triple mutant, TM (N166Y, A132D, L114P). Stability of mutant lipases Three lipase variants were tested for their thermostability by exposing them to 55 8C and estimating their residual activities at various timepoints at RT as described in Materials and Methods (Figure 2A). DM has nearly 100-fold increase and TM has nearly 300-fold increase in its half-life compared to the wild-type at 55 8C (Table 1). To the best of our knowledge this represents the fewest number of mutations resulting in such a significant increase in thermostability. Estimations of half-life of stability were made after exposing the TM for 20 hours and were not based on extrapolations. Comparisons at higher temperatures were not possible since the wild-type lost activity instantaneously. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization

Using p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA) as substrate, the kinetic parameters of mutants were determined at RT (Table. 1). Except for a decrease in Km for 2-8G10 and 2-3H5, the kinetic parameters of all mutants were similar to wild-type lipase. Small variations observed in kcat/Km suggest that the catalytic pathway was largely unaltered between

We investigated the solution structure of the mutants, DM and TM, and the wild-type by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectra arising from the two tryptophan residues were similar for the wild-type and the mutants (data not shown). The secondary structural content also did not show any change in mutants compared to wild-type as indicated by the far-UV CD spectra (data not shown). We have investigated the solution stability of the wild-type and the mutants by studying their equilibrium unfolding behavior in the presence of urea using fluorescence and circular dichroism. The mid-point of transition, i.e. unfolded fraction measured by Q222, for mutants shifted by 1 M on the urea scale, indicates an increased stability of these mutants (Figure 2B). Identical shifts were also obtained when fluorescence was used to calculate the percentage unfolding (data not shown). DG of unfolding transitions could not be calculated, since the protein does not show two-state transitions required for the model.1 Our previous study demonstrated the involvement of multiple intermediates in the unfolding of the wild-type.26 Drastic aggregation of the wild-type and partial aggregation of the mutants upon heating at concentrations around 1 mg/ml resulted in irreversible scans in differential scanning calorimetry and prevented calculation of thermodynamic parameters. Crystal structures of the mutants Lip A is one of the smallest lipases known and ° ° ° has dimensions of 35 A!36 A!42 A.23 It has a fold similar to that of a/b hydrolase fold enzymes and has single-domain architecture with a sixstranded parallel b-sheet surrounded by a-helices (Figure 3(a)). The three mutations that have been introduced by directed evolution approach are in different parts of the molecule. The overall structure of the TM and DM was very similar to that of the wild-type. The rms deviation in Ca positions of ° ° TM and DM were 0.374 A and 0.348 A, respectively, when compared with the wild-type. Also, the core packing, accessible surface area, ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions within the monomeric structure are very similar between the wild-type and TM or DM. However, each mutation introduces subtle changes in its surroundings and is described below. The first mutation (N166Y) that was picked up by the screening protocol has a tenfold increase in the half-life at 55 8C. This mutation occurs at the middle of a helix aF, connected to b8 strand through G5, a 310 helix. The mutation plays multiple roles in stabilizing the region around its vicinity (Figures 3(b) and 4(a)), which were identical between DM and TM. Y166 stacks with neighboring Y25 from an adjacent helix, aA, resulting in a classical parallel-displaced pi-stacking inter-

action.27­29 This results in a closest atom distance ° ° of 3.7 A, centroid­centroid distance of 5.2 A and normal­normal angle of 19.98, which are well within the range used for characterizing such interactions.30 This enhances the interaction

between the helices, which are at an angle of 578 to each other. A remarkable and subtle change was seen on the peptide formed between residues Y161 and S162 because of the introduction of Y166.This region connects the G5 and aF helices, and stacks with Y166.The j of Y161 and f of S162 moves by nearly 408 where as the f of Y161 and j of S162 remain practically unaltered thus leaving their sidechains in the same position as that of the wild-type (Figure 3(b)). A 358 change in the orientation of the

peptide plane results in a weak stacking interaction with Y166 at 368 compared with 718 of the peptide plane if it were in the wild-type conformation. ° This causes a movement of 0.63 A of the amino ° group of S162 and 1.44 A of the carbonyl oxygen atom of Y161. Due to this subtle change, the mainchain nitrogen atom of S162 establishes a hydrogen bonding contact with the carbonyl oxygen atom of G158 in G5 (Figure 4(a)). In addition, the carbonyl oxygen atom of Y161 interacts with a water

1276 molecule, which in turn interacts with the sidechain hydroxyl group of Y166. Thus the mutation, in addition to enhancing inter-helical packing,28 through pi-stacking interaction helps in stabilization by gaining a hydrogen bond in an indirect manner without any major alteration of the structure. The second mutation, A132D, is located in a loop connecting b7 strand and aE helix. In the first place, Ala132 is a hydrophobic residue in the surface of the molecule facing the solvent in the wild-type structure and a change to a hydrophilic residue is in itself a stabilizing mutation. Also, in both the double and triple mutant structures, the sidechain OD2 of the D132 residue establishes a strong ° hydrogen bonding interaction (2.58 A) with the main-chain amino group of G153 from a neighboring loop connecting b8 strand and G5 (Figure 4(b)). However, the additional interaction does not result in any significant change in the position of the two loops. Thus, the two surface loops of the molecule were linked to each other through an additional interaction enhancing the overall thermostability.31 The L114P mutation occurs in a region of the protein that has the longest stretch of 14 amino acid residues without any regular secondary structure. The stretch connects b6 and b7 strands where all the other parallel strand connectivities are through a-helices. Proline residues are known to stabilize the folded states of proteins compared to the unfolded state due to the constraints they introduce in the backbone conformation.32­36 Thus, a mutation of leucine to proline in the longest loop of the molecule might contribute to the stability of the protein. Interestingly, the crystal structure of the triple mutant shows anchoring of the carboxy terminus of the protein to the rest of the molecule as a result of the L114P mutation. Due to the mutation, the neighboring residue A113 moves in its Ca position compared to the DM and wild-type by ° around 0.8 A and the Ca of the C-terminal N181 ° moves by 0.73 A resulting in a better packing thereby placing one of the terminal oxygen atoms in a position favorable for interacting through a saltbridge with the side-chain of K122 (Figure 4(c) and (d)). Such an anchoring has not been seen in the coordinates of the three crystallographically independent structures of the wild-type protein molecule available, 1I6W-A and B chains23 and 1ISP.24 The 1I6W-A chain clearly lacks this interaction, whereas a slightly different mode of interaction is seen for the 1I6W-B chain between K122 and the carboxy terminus. However, the region around the C terminus in the 1I6W-B is involved in crystal packing contacts, indicating this interaction could have resulted from packing constraints rather than an interaction inherent to the wild-type structure. In ° the 1.3 A resolution (1ISP) structure,24 the highest available for the wild-type molecule, the C-terminal residue is not modeled in the electron density, indicating an inherent flexibility of the terminal residue. In addition, the triple mutant crystal

form did not have any packing contact around the C-terminal residue. To further confirm that the stabilization of the C terminus was a direct consequence of the L114P mutation, we determined the structure of the DM that did not contain this mutation. The double mutant clearly lacked the anchoring of the C terminus that is present in the triple mutant structure (Figure 4(d)). In the double mutant structure, the Ca of N181 is located similar to that of the wild-type structure and is not involved in a salt-bridge interaction with K122. Thus, the triple mutant structure suggests that subtle changes introduced by the L114P mutation indirectly resulted in a better anchoring of the C-terminal residue. Since the termini of protein molecules are thought to be one of the regions where the unfolding process begin, the structures demonstrate that anchoring them by additional interactions with other parts of the molecule could result in enhanced stability. Even though directed evolution approaches provide enhancement of a given property with relatively fewer changes compared to the naturally evolved systems, they still do not offer a minimalist solution.7 Understanding the molecular mechanisms of thermostability and assigning the role played by each of the mutations in an evolved protein becomes a difficult task. To reduce the randomness in the "uphill random walk" in directed evolution, we used the crystal structure information to reduce the neutral or harmful mutations that arose in early generations of errorprone PCR, by assessing their effect on the structure.7 The decision to carry forward a mutation was based on the known rules on compatibility of amino acid residues (e.g. Dayhoff matrix)25 based on properties viz. ionic, polarity, bulkiness, etc. Thus, by combining a rational approach using structural information, when available, and eliminating neutral mutations would significantly increase the functionally relevant mutations in addition to avoiding several generations of screening. In the first generation we found only one positive mutation, i.e. N166Y, which parented the second generation. In the second generation, we have obtained A68T, A68V, V71A, D144V, R147S, L114P and A132D along with N166Y. A careful examination of the three-dimensional structure showed that some of the mutations could result in either a bad van der Waals contact, for example A68T, or in loss of interactions present in the wildtype, for example D144V. Indeed when tested for thermostability, these mutations have not improved the thermostability of N166Y. Typically, mutations obtained using directed evolution were post facto modeled onto the crystal structure of the protein.14­17 However, here we attempted to use the structural information for identifying and combining the mutations obtained. This approach resulted in a final protein which had the fewest number of changes compared to the wild-type with a remarkable enhancement in thermostability.

1277 investigation. In any case, the structural results suggest that a rational approach through which the N or the C-terminal residue tethered to the core of a molecule could help in stabilization and can be used as a general strategy for enhancing thermostability. In the case of Lip A, for further enhancement of thermostability, efforts are underway to tighten the anchoring of the C termini starting from the triple mutant using rational design. Overall the study demonstrates that utilization of protein structural information may help to reduce the screening efforts and the resulting structural changes could be directly correlated with the property of interest.

In the absence of a common scale for thermostability description, it is not prudent to compare the thermostabilities achieved by various methods in different enzymes. A 300-fold increase in half-life of activity with merely three mutations could be considered as a parsimonious way of improving thermostability. Unlike some examples where the thermostability was improved due to mutations that enhanced interface regions in oligomeric proteins37 or increased binding of ligand resulting in higher thermostability,16 in TM the improvement was due to the direct or indirect effects of the mutations on the protein. Solution behavior of the wild-type and mutants suggests that these three mutations did not alter the catalytic pathway or binding constants of the enzyme. Nor were there significant changes in the structure as indicated by identical tyrptophan fluorescence spectra, far-UV CD and also the rms deviation of Ca among the three structures. Retention of activity by the mutants at room temperature similar to wild-type suggests that the enhancement in thermostability was achieved without any loss in activity at lower temperatures.7 To delineate the enthalpic and entropic contributions of these mutants to stability requires a careful investigation. For example, the L114P mutation in addition to decreasing the entropy of the unfolded state could also have an enthalpic role in establishing the C-terminal anchoring. Similarly in the case of the N166Y mutation, the pi-stacking interaction could be driven largely by entropy; however, it had indirect enthalpic effects by gaining additional interactions. The structural results demonstrate that minimal changes in the structure are sufficient for enhancing the thermostability. This is in accordance with the emerging notion that considerable reduction in flexibility need not correlate with enhanced stability.7 However, if flexibility is reduced at regions that are key to initiate the unfolding process then it might contribute significantly to increasing thermostability.38 The N and C termini of protein chains are normally known to adopt flexible conformations and instances were reported where shortening of the termini and/or anchoring of the termini increased thermostability.39,40 In the case of subtilisin, a mutation introduced at the third residue from the N terminus resulted in a disulphide bridge thereby enhancing the overall thermostability.39 In the TM structure, mutations at a different region, L114P, than the termini brings about changes that resulted in a better anchoring of the C-terminal residue. The L114P mutation could have several reasons for the enhanced stability compared to the wild-type as discussed earlier. This is indeed reflected by the fact that K122 could be modeled only with some difficulty during later stages of refinement even though a continuous density emanating from the terminal carboxylate group was present from the very early stages of refinement. This interaction therefore may have contributed only partially to the overall enhancement in thermostability, which is currently under

PNPA and Triton X-100 were from Sigma Chemical Co. Ethylene glycol was from Merck. p-Nitrophenyloleate (PNPO) was synthesized by conventional means from an equimolar solution of oleic acid and p-nitrophenol in dichloromethane using an equivalent amount of N,N 0 -dimethylcyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI) and a catalytic amount of 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).41 All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Optimization of the construct used for screening Lip A is an aggregation prone protein that on overexpression under the T7 promoter in Escherichia coli partitions into inclusion bodies (data not shown). It is also partially toxic to E. coli under overexpression conditions and slows growth drastically. To counter the problem of toxicity and to ensure a uniform, soluble population of the protein for the screening protocol, it was necessary to use a tightly regulated low-level expression system. The gene coding for the mature protein was expressed under the low copy (w15) plasmid pJO290 under the control of the lac promoter. The expression was carried out in JM109 cells that provided a genomic lacIq to further control expression levels. Finally, cells were maintained and grown in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) glucose under noninducing conditions. Under these conditions, on induction with 0.5 mM IPTG, the protein produced remains entirely in the soluble fraction as determined by Western blots of the soluble and insoluble fractions (data not shown). Construction of vectors for screening and purification of lipase The lipase gene along with the region coding for the signal sequence from pLip A was amplified with primers 5 0 -GGAGGATCATATGAAATTTGTAAAAA-3 0 and 5 0 -CCCGGGATCCATTGTCCGTTACC-3 0 . The primers contained engineered NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively. The amplified product was cloned into plasmid pET-21b yielding the plasmid pET-lipwt. The lipase gene coding for the mature protein was amplified from pET-lipwt by using primers 5 0 -CGTCAGCGAATTCCGCTGAACA CAT-3 0 and 5 0 -GCGGGAAGGATCCGAATTCGAGCT-3 0 with engineered EcoRI and BamHI, and cloned into

pJO290.This construct was used for screening thermostable mutants. The E. coli strain JM109 was used for all the screening steps and all media contained 0.2% glucose unless otherwise mentioned.42 Generation of mutant lipases Initially, variation in the gene was generated by using error-prone PCR. Primers 5 0 -CGCCAGGGTTTTCCC AGTCACGAC-3 0 (JOF) and 5 0 -TGACACAGGAAACA GCTATGAC-3 0 (JOR) flank the gene beyond the EcoRI and BamHI sites present on the plasmid were used for amplification. Error-prone PCR was carried out in a 100 ml reaction volume containing 20 fmol of the plasmid pJO290-lip, 50 pmol each of primers JOF and JOR, 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.3) at 25 8C, 500 mM KCl, 0.1% (w/v) gelatin, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM MnCl2, 1 mM each dTTP and dCTP, 0.2 mM each dATP and dCTP and five units of Taq DNA polymerase. After an initial denaturation of three minutes at 94 8C, the following steps were repeated for 30 cycles in a thermal cycler: one minute at 94 8C, one minute at 45 8C and one minute at 72 8C. The amplified product was gel-purified and ligated into pJ0290 and transformed into E. coli JM109. The mutant DM was created from the clone 2-8G10 and wild-type by using the unique restriction site HaeII of the lipase gene. The genes coding for the two proteins were amplified by PCR using the phage T7 promoter and terminator primers. A three-point ligation containing the NdeI-HaeII fragment (from the wild-type), the HaeIIBamHI fragment (from 2-8G10) and pET-21b cut with NdeI and BamHI was set up and transformed into DH5 a for selection. The mutant TM with L116P was created by site-directed mutagenesis on the DM template using the mutagenic primer 5 0 -GGC AAG GCG CCT CCG GGA ACA GAT-3 0 using standard procedures.42 For substitution, an oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation was used as the primer (mismatch primer) to initiate chain extension between the 5 0 and 3 0 PCR primers. In the first PCR, the mismatch primer and the 3 0 primer were used to generate a DNA fragment containing the new base substitution. The fragment was separated from the template and primers by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified and used as the new 3 0 primer in a second PCR with the 5 0 primer to generate full-length product, which was cloned into pET-21b for expression of the mutant protein. The sequences of all the genes were confirmed by automated DNA sequencer using ABI PRISM 377TM. Screening Screening for thermostability was performed in 96-well plates. Natural substrates for B. subtilis lipase are triglycerides and there is a preference for C8 substrates.22 Since assays involving triglycerides as substrates cannot be easily translated to high-throughput formats, p-nitrophenyl esters were used for the assay. PNPO was found to be a suitable substrate as it had very low background hydrolysis in cell lysate assays compared to shorterchain esters such as PNPA and p-nitrophenyl caprylate. PNPO micellized in Triton X-100 was used for the assay. Triton X-100 has the advantage of lysing the cells and also solubilizing the water-insoluble substrate. Thermostability was assessed based on the residual activity subsequent to exposure at higher temperature. The parameter for selection of mutants was (MutantRes.Act/ WTRes.Act). Colonies obtained after transforming the ligation product were patched on chloramphenicol plates

and simultaneously inoculated in individual wells of a microtitre plate containing 200 ml of 2!YT containing 25 mg/ml of chloramphenicol and 0.2% glucose. After 24 hours of growth, the cultures were used to inoculate fresh medium. Three hours of growth was allowed before the addition of 1 mM IPTG and after a further three hours of induction the cells were diluted 1 : 1 (v/v) with phosphate buffer at pH 7 into two identical plates. One of the plates was exposed to high temperature for 20 minutes, cooled on ice for 15 minutes and then allowed to come to room temperature, whereas the second plate was directly kept at room temperature. PNPOTriton X-100 substrate solution (25 ml) was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 8C and absorbance at 405 nm was recorded in an ELISA reader at definite time-intervals. Ratio of activity of each clone at RT versus higher temperature was taken as residual activity and was used to identify the positives. Positives were confirmed by performing an identical assay in tubes. Ten milliliters of cells were pelleted after three hours of induction with IPTG and washed with STE buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA) and resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8). The pellet was sonicated for two minutes with intermittent cooling and the supernatant was separated after spinning at 15,000 rpm (SS34, Sorvall) for 45 minutes. After exposure to higher temperature for 20 minutes and cooling on ice the samples were centrifuged and assayed at RT. Lysates of cells that do not contain the lipase gene but otherwise processed similarly, were used to determine the background hydrolysis of PNPO in E. coli cell lysate. The background hydrolysis values were subtracted from the enzymatic activity value. The total protein in the cell lysates was determined by Lowry's method and was used to normalize the activity.

Protein purification Mutant proteins were purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET-21b carrying the lipase inserts. For this, the gene corresponding to the fulllength, mature protein was amplified with primers 5 0 -CCATGATTACGCATATGGCTGAACACAA-3 0 and JOF. The forward primer had an engineered NdeI site. The wild-type protein as well as the mutants were amplified, digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated with pET-21b. The forward primer also introduced a start codon at the start of the lipase gene in the form of the ATG sequence that is part of the NdeI recognition sequence. This would introduce a methionine residue in the N terminus of the mature protein, expressed in E. coli, just before the N-terminal alanine residue that occurs in the protein purified from the culture supernatant of B. subtilis. Protein was purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Cells containing the appropriate plasmid were grown till mid-log phase before inducing with 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested after 2.5 hours of induction by centrifuging at 15,000 rpm at 4 8C for 20 minutes (Sorvall RC-5B, Dupont Instruments). The pellet was washed with STE and resuspended in 1! TE containing 0.3 mg/ml of lysozyme. The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 minutes before lysing the cells by sonication in ice. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm at 4 8C for 30 minutes. The supernatant was loaded onto a phenyl Sepharose column. The remaining steps were done as described.26

Activity measurements PNPO was used in all activity measurements performed on cell lysates (vide supra), whereas PNPA was used to estimate the kinetic parameters of purified lipases, since it is soluble in water. Triton X-100 micellized PNPO was used as substrate for lipase. The 2! stock substrate was prepared by weighing 0.4 mM PNPO and 40 mM Triton X-100 in a glass vial and mixed with a magnetic stirrer till the ester completely dissolved in Triton X-100. Buffer was added slowly while stirring to prepare a clear 2! stock solution. Heat treatment of the purified proteins was carried out in a programmable thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR system 9700) in 0.2 ml thin-walled PCR tubes to allow precise temperature control of the samples. Protein (25 ml) (1.25 mg in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) were heated for the required time, cooled at 4 8C for 20 minutes, centrifuged and equilibrated at room temperature before assaying for enzymatic activity. The heat-treated protein sample (20 ml) was added to 1 ml of 0.05 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 2 mM PNPA. Enzymatic activity was measured at 25 8C by monitoring the rate of increase in absorbance at 405 nm. Typically, inactivation was followed until O80% of the activity was lost. Inactivation rate constants (kinact) were obtained from the slope and half-lives were calculated as t1=2 Z log 2=kinact . All kinetic measurements were made using a thermostatted spectrophotometer using PNPA.26,41 The 100! substrate stocks of the water-soluble PNPA were made in acetone and 2 mM PNPA was used for each reaction. Initial rates of hydrolysis of PNPA at various concentrations were determined at 25 8C in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The values for KM and kcat were derived from the corresponding Lineweaver­Burke plots.

Structure determination of mutants Two of the thermostable mutants, TM and DM, have been crystallized in space group R3 with one molecule in ° ° the asymmetric unit and data sets of 1.8 A and 2.0 A have been collected from them as described.43 The structures were solved with the wild-type lipase structure as a model (1I6W-Achain) using MOLREP-AUTO MR44 as implemented in the CCP4 suite.45 Both the mutants yielded clear solutions in the rotational and translational search and could be refined to R-factors of 30.8% and 32.3% for DM1 and TM, respectively, after initial rigid body refinement. After a few cycles of refinement using CNS46 and model building using the program O,47 the structures could be refined to an Rcryst of 22.6% and 21.0% for TM and DM1, respectively. The refinement statistics are given in Table 2. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates of both DM and TM have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 1T4M and 1T2N respectively.
