Abstract--Novel oxazolidinone antibacterials bearing a variety of 3-indolylglyoxamide substituents have been explored in an effort to improve the spectrum and potency of this class of agents. A subclass of this series was also made with the diversity at C-5 terminus. These derivatives have been screened against a panel of clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and fastidious Gramnegative organisms. Several analogs in this series were identified with in vitro activity superior to linezolid (MIC = 0.25­2 lg/ mL). Compounds 10a, 10c, 10e and 10f displayed activity against linezolid resistant Gram-positive organisms (MIC = 2­4 lg/ mL). Selected oxazolidinones were evaluated for in vivo efficacy against a mouse systemic infection model. Ó 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The oxazolidinones, exemplified by linezolid 1 and eperezolid 2, are a group of promising antibacterials active against a variety of susceptible and resistant Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP).1 This class is known to inhibit the bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit and prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex.2 Due to this unique mechanism of action, no cross-resistance is expected between the oxazolidinones and the other families of antibacterials. Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone to receive FDA approval, has become an important clinical option for the treatment of nosocomial resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections. However, a few cases of linezolid-resistant pathogens in clinical isolates have been reported.3 The emergence of early resistance and safety concerns in terms of myelosupression emphasize the need for the development of more effective oxazolidinones.4 (see Fig. 1).

In the course of research to enhance the spectrum and potency of oxazolidinones,5 we embarked on relatively less explored glyoxamide derivatives. There are only two examples reported in the literature carrying 3-thienyl and methyl glyoxamide substituents on piperazine scaffold of eperezolid analogs.6 This type of modification resulted in compounds with improved antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens. For example, MIC values are in the range of 0.25­0.5 lg/mL and 0.5­ 2 lg/mL against S. aureus organisms for 3-thienyl and methyl glyoxamide derivatives, respectively. On the other hand, indole ring provides instant access to a variety of 3-indolylglyoxamides. The synthetic ease and diversity of indole derivatives as well as the reported potency of glyoxamides prompted us to investigate the effect of indolylglyoxamides 3 on the antibacterial activity of oxazolidinones. Thus, a focused library was made wherein hydroxyacetamido group in eperezolid has been replaced initially with various substituted 3-indolylglyoxamides. In the second variation, acetamide at C-5 terminus has been modified with various N-and O-linked substituents keeping 5-bromoindole fixed on the left hand side. The synthesis and antibacterial activity of these compounds are reported herein. The advanced intermediates 4, 5, 6, and 7 were prepared conveniently following the reported procedure as depicted in Scheme 1.7 The 3-indolylglyoxalyl chlorides

have been made by the treatment of corresponding indoles 8a­h with oxalyl chloride. Subsequently, the reaction of these 3-indolylglyoxalyl chlorides with 7 in the presence of Hunig's base produced targeted oxazolidinones 9a­h in good yields.8 A series of C-5 acetamide compounds was screened against a panel of susceptible and resistant Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative strains.9 As per the data summarized in Table 1, most of the analogs exhibited superior activity compared to linezolid against MSSA, MRSA, E. faecalis and E. faecium. The simple indole analog 9a exhibited onefold better activity compared to linezolid against most of the organisms. Among the 5-substituted indole derivatives (9b, 9c, 9e, and 9h), 5-bromoindole 9h displayed 1-2-fold superior potency compared to linezolid across the panel of organisms. The MIC values of this derivative against S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. faecium are in the range of 0.5­1 lg/mL. The antibacterial activity was minimally impacted when indole moiety in 9a was substituted by azaindole 9d. In vitro activities of 2-methylindole 9f

and N-methylindole 9g were onefold better than linezolid against two enterococcal strains. However, none of these molecules showed antibacterial activity against a representative Gram-negative CAP (community acquired pneumonia) pathogen such as H. influenzae. The preliminary SAR indicates that the position and electronic nature of substituents on indole ring have little influence on the antibacterial activity. Thus, the in vitro activities of simple indole analog 9a and the rest of the molecules in Table 2 are comparable (see Scheme 2). In the next phase, SAR on a relatively potent compound 9h from the above series was undertaken at C-5 side chain of oxazolidinone pharmacophore. Previous studies had identified various cyclic and acyclic surrogates for the privileged acetamidomethyl side chain.10­13 Accordingly, acetamide group in 9h has been replaced with a variety of substituents including amides, carbamates and azoles. As illustrated in Scheme 3, primary amine 6 was reacted with ethyl dithioacetate to yield the corresponding thioacetamide. Subsequently, trifluo-

6 with thiophosgene to produce the corresponding isothiocyanate, which in turn reacted with excess of methanol under reflux. The cyclopropyl amide 10d was fashioned by the sequential treatment of 6 with cyclopropyl carboxylic acid in the presence of EDCÆHCl, trifluoroacetic acid and then 5-bromo 3-indolylglyoxalyl chloride obtained from 8h. Similarly, difluoroacetamide 10e and dichloroacetamide 10f have been accessed by using difluoroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid, respectively. The triazole derivative 10g was made by the reaction of azide 5 with bicyclo[2.2.1] hepta-2,5-diene at 100 °C in a closed vial. The isooxazole ring was appended at C-5 position by exposing alcohol 4 to Mitsunobu conditions. The tBoc group was cleaved by acid treatment and the resulting amine was derivatized with 5-bromo 3-indolylglyoxalyl chloride to afford ether derivative 10h. All of the analogs were tested in vitro against a broader panel of Gram-positive bacteria including linezolidresistant organisms14 and fastidious Gram-negative bacteria such as M. catarrhallis and H. influenzae. The results are presented in Table 2. In general, C-5 modifications based on N-linkage were well tolerated and furnished potent molecules. The analogs 10a, 10b, 10c, 10e, 10f and 10g showed excellent in vitro activity against key Gram-positive pathogens (MICs = 0.25­ 2 lg/mL). The thiocarbonyl compounds 10a and 10c were more potent than the corresponding oxocarbonyl compounds 9h and 10b as observed in many other oxazolidinone series.10 The enhancement in potency could

be the result of subtle changes in electronic character and lipophilicity of the molecules.10a­c The dihaloacetamides 10e and 10f have shown improved potency compared to simple acetamide 9h. This characteristic is reminiscent to the C-5 modifications reported by Vicuron and Pfizer groups using various haloacetamides.11The noteworthy feature of thioacetamide 10a, thiocarbamate 10c, difluoroacetamide 10e and dichloroacetamide 10f analogs is their activity against linezolidresistant S. aureus and E. faecalis (MICs = 2­4 lg/mL). This result exemplifies that appropriate substitution around oxazolidinone would result in compounds active against linezolid-resistant organisms. Though the rational behind this activity feature is not very clear, it can be attributed to distinct binding mode to oxazolidi-

none site and/or binding to additional site on ribosome. Cyclopropyl amide 10d derivative showed 1-2-fold less potency than acetamide congener 9h. Among the C-5linked azoles, the activity of triazole derivative 10g was comparable to acetamide 9h and superior to standard. The result is in accordance with the early work on C-5 heterocyclic groups.12 However, the O-isooxazole substitution at C-5 terminus in 10h proved to be detrimental to the antibacterial activity. This observation is in contrast to the report disclosing tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydropyridyl series where O-linked isooxazole was found to be optimal.13 Most of the analogs exhibited respectable activity against fastidious Gram-negative bacterium M. catarhalis (MIC = 2­4 lg/mL). However, these molecules were devoid of antibacterial activity against other Gram-negative organism H. influenzae. The lack of activity against this Gram-negative organism in both series could be due in part to active efflux, effectively lowering the intracellular concentration of the test compound.15 In general the SAR at C-5 terminus followed the trend as reported earlier in most of the cases and showed improvement in in vitro activity except for the O-isooxazole analog 10h. These results once again prove that C-5 side chain can accommodate diverse functionalities depending upon the nature of other substituents in the molecule. Selected oxazolidinones 9a, 9b, 9d, 9h, 10a, 10c, 10d, 10e, 10f, and 10g from both the series have been tested in vivo against S. aureus DRCC 035 organism in a murine systemic infection model by oral route.16 The ED50 values are presented in Table 3. Compounds 9a, 9h, 10d, and 10g protected mice from infection at higher doses compared to linezolid despite the good in vitro activity against this organism. Subsequently, pharmacokinetic studies of representative molecules 9b, 9d, 9h and 10d in mice were taken up. The pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 4. Upon oral administration, the absorption from mouse gastrointestinal tract was slow and the maximum plasma concentration reached at 2­3 h (Tmax) in all the compounds except for 9d. The elimination half-life (t1/2) and rate of elimination (Kel) were in the range of linezolid for most of the compounds. However, the mean plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC(0­t)) of these oxazolidinones were poor compared to linezolid. Thus, the higher ED50 values can be attributed to poor pharmacokinetics exhibited by these compounds. In summary, a novel series of oxazolidinones bearing indolylglyoxamides active against resistant and susceptible Gram-positive pathogens has been identified. These analogs with acetamide moiety at C-5 position were

found to be 1-2-fold more potent compared to linezolid against the tested organisms. Notable improvements in terms of potency and spectrum have been made through the introduction of halogenated amides, thioamides and 1,2,3-triazole at C-5 side chain. Compounds 10a, 10c, 10e and 10f exhibited excellent activity against Grampositive organisms such as MSSA, MRSA, E. faecalis and E. faecium. The activity of these four molecules against linezolid-resistant S. aureus and E. faecalis is an additional trait of the present series (MIC = 2­4 lg/ mL). A few members of this series also showed in vivo efficacy in a lethal murine infection model at higher doses.

To a solution of indole (80 mg, 0.68 mmol) in THF was added oxalyl chloride (0.065 mL, 0.75 mmol) dropwise at 0 °C and the reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 4 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to obtain indole-3-glyoxalyl chloride as a yellow solid. To a suspension of 7 (150 mg, 0.44 mmol) and above-prepared indole-3-glyoxalyl chloride (140 mg, 0.66 mmol) in THF, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.155 mL, 0.89 mmol) was added dropwise and stirred at rt overnight. Finally it was quenched with 10% aq NaHCO3 (20 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2· 20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water followed by brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4.

In vivo experiment. The infecting inoculum (0.5 mL) was adjusted to yield approximately 100 times LD50 and injected intraperitoneally (108 cfu/mL). The test compounds were formulated in sterile Tween and carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) and then administered by oral route for 1 day at 1 and 5 h post-infection. A treatment group of six mice was used for each antibiotic dose level. Death in each treated and untreated group was monitored daily for 5 days. The ED50 values were calculated by Probit analysis.
