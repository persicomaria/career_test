Previously, we reported the high resolution NMR structure of the hairpin G-quartet structure formed by the G-rich strand of the insulin minisatellite of repeat sequence,   egeqR qqR qgR egegR located upstream of the human insulin gene. Here, we report structural studies on the C-rich strand of this insulin minisatellite. First, we show by high resolution NMR that (C4TGTC4) forms a hairpin dimer with intercalated C Á C pairs (referred to as the hairpin i-motif); 340 NOE distance constraints uniquely de®ne the nature of hairpin folding and the pattern of C Á C intercalation. Second, we show by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling studies that (C4TGTC4ACA4TGTC4) forms an intramolecularly folded hairpin with intercalated C Á C pairs. Third, we demonstrate by in vitro replication studies that several such hairpin i-motifs are present in long (C4TGTC4ACA)n (n 5 6) sequences, even in the presence of their complementary strands. Finally, we discuss structural and biological signi®cance of the hairpin i-motifs formed by the C-rich strands of the insulin minisatellite.

Introduction
The insulin minisatellite, also referred to as the insulin-linked polymorphic region (ILPR), is located upstream of the human insulin gene (Bell et al., 1981, 1982; Owerbach & Aagaard, 1984). the ILPR is highly polymorphic in repeat length and repeat sequence (Bennett et al., 1995; Lucassen et al., 1995). Both length and sequence variations in the ILPR affect the expression of the insulin gene (Kennedy et al., 1995). Previously, we reported on the structural basis for the length polymorphism of the ILPR. The G-rich strand of the ILPR was

shown to form a hairpin G-quartet (Catasti et al., 1996; P. Catasti, X. Chen, E. M. Bradbury & G. Gupton, unpublished results) and we proposed that the formation of such structures during replication provided an explanation for the observed length polymorphism. We pointed out also that the formation of the hairpin G-quartet structure upstream of the insulin gene would generate negative supercoiling and facilitate transcription. Here, we show by 2D NMR that the fragment (C4TGTC4) from the C-rich strand of the ILPR forms a hairpin dimer that is stabilized by intercalated CytosineÁ Cytosine (C Á C) pairs. We also describe in vitro replication data that are explained by the formation of multiple hairpins with intercalated C Á C pairs in (C4ACAC4TGT)6. Gueron and co-workers were the ®rst to report the intercalated C Á C paired structure (or the i-motif) for various synthetic DNA sequences containing C-tracts in solution at acidic pH ($4.5) (Gehring et al., 1993; Leroy et al., 1994). These struc# 1997 Academic Press Limited

370 tures contained two parallel stranded C Á C paired duplexes. Two such parallel duplexes intercalated in opposite polarity to form this novel i-motif tetramer. Later, the ``i-motif'' structures were determined by X-ray crystallography for single copy sequences of the human telomere (CCCAAT; Berger et al., 1995) and the metazoan telomere (TAACCC; Kang et al., 1995). Our work signi®cantly extends the scope of the i-motif as a biologically relevant structural entity as follows. (i) We show that two hairpins (rather than two parallel duplexes) can also form the i-motif. The NMR data of the ILPR sequence (C4TGTC4) are unequivocal in demonstrating the presence of a hairpin that folds at the T5pG6pT7 loop and associates with another equivalent hairpin with a 2-fold symmetry. (ii) We show by NMR that the formation of the i-motif by (C4TGTC4) requires only mildly acidic pH with 6.5 as the midpoint of the pH-induced transition. (iii) The i-motifs are also formed by the natural ILPR sequences (C4ACA4TGT)n under physiological conditions; (iv) An increase in the number of repeats, n, increases the probability of the formation of the i-motif by the C-rich strand even in presence of its complementary G-rich strand, i.e. multiple hairpin i-motif structures are present for longer repeat lengths. The possibility of stable hairpin folding in the C-rich strand offers a mechanism for slippage during replication similar to that observed in our studies on the G-rich strand (Catasti et al., 1996). The stable folding of the Crich strand also generates an unwound structure upstream of the insulin gene that may facilitate transcription.

Figure 1. 1D NMR spectra of (C4TGTC4) in H2O at 10 C. The spectra show the imino, amino, base and H1H regions. (a) The presence of imino and amino signals from the C residues at pH 7.0, indicates that (C4TGTC4) is partially folded to form C Á C parallel base-pairs. (b) Lower pH values allow protonation of the C residues and subsequent stabilization of hemi-protonated C Á C parallel base-pairs. Imino (15 to 16 ppm) and amino (7.5 to 9.5 ppm) signals sharpen as (C4TGTC4) folds into an ordered structure as indicated by the presence of loop imino signals around 11 ppm.

Results
1D NMR study of (C4TGTC4) Figure 1 shows the 1D spectra of (C4TGTC4) at 10 C in H2O at pH 7 (a), and pH 5 (b). Note that at pH 5, only the exchangeable imino and amino protons of the hemi-protonated and triply H-bonded C Á C pairs are present in the spectrum. The nonexchangeable base region in the spectrum indicates the presence of a single species. Note also that the imino signals from the unpaired guanine (G6) and thymine residues (T5 and T7) in the loop, appear within 10.5 to 10.8 ppm in the spectra. At pH 7, we observe the simultaneous presence of an ordered structure and a coil. Note that the imino protons of the C Á C pairs are present even at neutral pH. The pH-induced order-to-coil transition in (C4TGTC4) was determined by monitoring the two methyl groups from two T residues. The midpoint of transition if at pH 6.5 and only the ordered structure is present at pH 5.5 and below. We have also monitored the coil and ordered populations at different temperatures by monitoring the respective methyl signals of T5 and T7 of (C4TGTC4) at pH 5. This molecule shows a sharp melting transition with tm

at 62 C. All 2D NMR experiments on (C4TGTC4) were conducted at pH 5. 2D NMR study of (C4TGTC4) One hydrogen-bonded imino proton is present in each plane of a C Á C pair. Each imino proton in a C Á C pair is proximal to the two amino groups in the same pair. In each amino group, one proton is internal and H-bonded, whereas the other is external and not H-bonded. These (imino, amino) spin systems of the C Á C pair are easily identi®ed by a 2D NOESY experiment. Figure 2 shows a 2D WATERGATE NOESY cross-section for 250 ms of mixing. Eight cytosine (imino, amino) spin systems (Ca through Ch) are identi®ed in Figure 2. Note that at the displayed contour level only four cytosine residues (Cb, Ce, Cc, and Cf) show iminoamino NOEs, whereas at a lower contour level the remaining four C residues (Ca, Cd, Cg, and Ch) also show imino-amino NOEs. However, aminoamino NOEs involving the internal and external protons are observed for all eight C residues. The H5 protons of eight C residues are identi®ed through amino ± H5 NOEs (data not shown). 2D NOESY experiments in 2H2O enable us to identify

371 sugar protons belonging to two T and one G residue.

Topological arrangement and NMR proton assignments of (C4TGTC4) The presence of 11 distinguishable spin systems belonging to 11 nucleotides in (C4TGTC4) implies that two conformationally equivalent strands associate to form the C Á C paired structure. Also in Figure 1, the presence of the imino signals within 11.5 to 11.0 ppm from the T and the G residues implies that each strand folds into a hairpin with a T5pG6pT7 loop. C Á C pairs are formed between to parallel strands only and this is possible by the association of at least two (C4TGTC4) hairpins. Two hairpins can associate in four different antiparallel arrangements to produce an intercalated C Á C paired i-motif. In these four arrangements, T5pG6pT7 loops either connect the narrow (N) or the wide (W) edge and the terminal C Á C pair lies either on the 3H or the 5H side. These four arrangements are designated as N-3, N-5, W-3, and W-5 respectively, in Figure 3. Key internucleotide NOEs involving (N4H2, N4H1 ± H6, H1H ), (N4H2, N4H1 ± H2H , H2HH ), and (H1H ± H2H , H2HH ) distinguish between these four arrangements of two antiparallel (C4TGTC4) hairpins. Figure 4(a) shows the N4H2 versus H6 NOESY cross-section; Figure 4(b) shows the assignment of eight H6 protons belonging to eight C residues from the same NOESY spectrum; Figure 4(c) shows the N4H2 versus H2H , H2HH NOESY cross-section and Figure 4(d) shows the identi®cation of the 11 (H2H , H2HH ) spin systems belonging to eight C, two T and one G residue. T5 and G6 are assigned by their H1H ± H8 sequential connectivity (data not shown). In Figure 5(a) to (c) internucleotide connectivity shows the following two networks: Cd 6 Ca 6 Cb 6 Ce and Ce 6 Cf 6 Cg 6 Ch. Cd is identi®ed as C8 because of the presence of inter-nucleotide NOEs involving the sugar protons H3H , H4H , H5HH of Cd and H6 of a T (see Figure 6, below). This T can only be T7, since T5 has already been assigned. The T5pG6pT7 loop connecting through the wide edge (W-3 and W-5 in Figure 3), the N4H2, N4H1 ±H6 connectivities should involve a continuos stretch of NOEs that include all eight C residues. However, in Figure 4(a) we observe two sets of connectivities including four C residues, i.e. Cd 6 Ca 6 Cb 6 Cc, and Ce 6 Cf 6 Cg 6 Ch. Only N-3 and N-5 are compatible with such an NOE pattern. From Figure 3 we can also observe four pairs of N4H2 ± H2H ,H2HH NOE connectivities. Again, only parallel base-pairs intercalated on the 5H side satisfy the observed NOE pattern. Therefore, the only topological model compatible with the NMR data is N-5 in ®gure 3 in which two (C4TGTC4) hairpins of opposite polarity associate to form an i-motif such that the terminal C Á C pairs are on the 5H side. In this arrangement two

Eight crosspeaks from the eight C amino pairs (N4H1, N4H2) are visible. Because, at this stage of the NMR study we still do not have the speci®c assignments, the C residues are labeled as Ca to h. Only imino-amino NOE connectivities from Cb, Cc, Cf and Ce are visible. Ca, Cd, Cg and Ch probably form the external C Á C base-pairs,. Due to a faster solvent exchange, the related cross-peak intensities are weaker and they are not visible at the level at which the cross-sections were drawn. Cb and Cf amino signals have the same imino resonance chemical shift, suggesting that they belong to the same internal basepair. the same is also true for Cc and Ce. An NOE is observed for the imino protons from (Cb, Cf) and (Cc, Ce), indicating that they form two C Á C base-pairs stacked on top of each other, the spectrum was acquired with a sweep width of 12 kHz; t2 size was 2048 points; 1024 tl increments in the TPPI mode were acquired with 64 transients each. The spectrum was apodized with a shifted-squared-sine-bell (70 in t2 and 80 in tl) and zero-®lled to a ®nal 2048 Â 2048 data matrix with a digital resolution of 6 Hz/pt

the spin systems of the C residues involving H6, H5, H1H , H2H /H2HH , H3H , H4H H5H /H5HH ). Therefore, the combination of WATERGATE NOESY and NOESY in 2H2O allows us to complete the identi®cation of the spin-system (N3H, N4H1, N4H2, H6, H5, H1H , H2H /H2HH , H3H , H4H , H5H /H5HH ) belonging to eight C residues. The assignments of the sugar protons are further con®rmed by the DQF-COSY data in 2H2O. Eleven distinct signals are present in the non-exchangeable base region as expected from 11 H8/H6 of (C4TGTC4). Three protons that are not accounted for by the C residues belong to two T and one G residue. T residues are distinguished from the single G by the H6 ± CH3 NOEs in T residues. Therefore, 2D NOESY and DQF-COSY data also enable us to the identify the base and the

Figure 3. The unrolled surface maps of the four possible ways two hairpins of (C4TGTC4) can associate to form a stem-loop structure with intercalated parallel C Á C base-pairs. Two parallel DNA double strands can intercalate either by 3H end or 5H end stacking. Moreover, the T5pG6pT7 loops can connect either through the wide edge or through the narrow edge. The four possible arrangements of the hairpin dimer are labeled as: N-3, N-5, W-3, and W-5. The letter N or W indicates whether the loop is connected through the narrow (N) or wide (W) edge, and the number 3 or 5 whether the intercalated base-pairs are stacked on the 3H or 5H side. Each topological arrangement leads to different sets of NOE connectivities involving the proton pairs: amino ±H6, amino ± H1H , amino ± (H2H , H2HH ), and H1H ± (H2H , H2HH ).

hairpin arms are de®ned by (Cd, Ca, Cb, Cc) and Ce, Cf, Cg, Ch). If Cd is C8, from Figure 4, then the following assignments follow: Cb  C9, Cc  C10, Ca  C11. The assignments of the C residues in the (Ce, Cf, Cg, Ch) arm are obtained by examining the internucleotide NOEs between the two arms of the N-5 arrangement (see Figure 3). These internucleotide NOEs involve H1H of the C residues in one arm and H2H , H2HH of the C residues in the other arm (and vice-versa). Figure 5(a) shows the H1H versus H2H , H2HH NOESY cross-section. Note the presence of H1H (Ca/Ch) ±H2H , H2HH (Ch/Ca) NOEs. since Ca is already assigned as C11, Ch must be C1. Therefore, it follows from Figures 4 and 5 that Ce  C3, Cf  C2, Cg  C4. Chemical shift values are enclosed in a Table as Supplementary Material. Derivation of the intercalated hairpin dimer structure of (C4TGTC4)2 Analyses of the NOESY data at 75 and 300 ms of mixing and DQF-COSY data in 100% 2H2O, provide the following structural information. (i) Intranucleotide H8/H6 ± (H1H , H2H , H2HH , H3H ) NOEs reveal that the majority of the C residues adopt

C3H -endo, anti conformations; T5, G6, and T7 in the loop adopt C2H -endo, anti conformation. (ii) H1H versus H2H , H2HH DQF-COSY cross-section (Figure 5(b)) shows that C2, C3, C8, C9, C10 and C11, are in C3H -endo pucker and C1, C4, T5, G6 and T7 are in C2H -endo puckers. (iii) A set of internucleotide NOEs involving (N4H2, N4H1 ± H2H , H2HH ), (N4H2, N4H1 ±H6, H1H ), and (H1H ±H2H , H2HH ) uniquely de®nes the stereochemistry of chain folding and the intercalation pattern. Re®nement by full-matrix NOESY simulation (Catasti et al., 1994; Gupta et al., 1993) of the observed set of NOESY cross-peak intensities results in a set of 340 inter-proton distances. A total of 240 NOEs involve C residues in the stem, of which 72 involve non-exchangeable resonances (H1H ±H1H , H1H ± H4H , H1 ± H2H , H1H ±H2HH , and H5 ± H5), and 168 involve exchangeable resonances (N4H1 ±H2H N4H1 ± H2HH , N4H2 ±H2H , N4H2 ± H2HH , N4H2 ±H1H , N4H2 ±H6, N4H2 ± H6, N4H1 ± H5, N4H2 ±H5). A total of 100 NOEs, involving nonexchangeable resonances, are obtained for nucleotides in the T5pG6pT7 loop. Most of the NOEs in the loop originate from the interaction of (G6 and T7) with C8 in the stem. T5 has only on NOE with C8 in the stem, and two NOEs with G6 in the loop.

Cross-sections (a) and (c) were taken from the NOESY spectrum described in Figure 2. Cress-sections (b) and (d) were taken from a NOESY spectrum of (C4TGTC4)2 in 2H2O at 10 C, p2H 5.0, and Tm  300 ms. The (b) crosssection shows the 2D NOESY H6/H8 ± H6/H8 diagonal, whereas the (d) cross-section shows the H6/H8± (H2H , H2HH , CH3) connectivities. The 2H2O NOESY spectrum was acquired with a sweep width of 5000 Hz, t2 size was 2048 points, 512 tl increments were acquired in the TPPI mode with 32 transients each. The spectra were apodized with a squared-sine-bell (70 in t2 and 80 in tl) and zero-®lled to a ®nal 1024 Â 1024 data matrix with a digital resolution of 5 Hz/pt. In the (c) cross-section NOEs are observed between four pairs of C residues: Ca ± Cd, Cb± Cc, Ce ±Cf and Cg± Ch. Each pair of C residues has symmetric NOEs between the amino of one C and the H2H , H2HH protons of the other one. In the (a) cross-section, NOE connectivities between bound C amino protons and C(H6) are shown: a continuous stretch of assignments can be drawn for Cd 6 Ca 6 Cb 6 Cc and for Ce 6 Cf 6 Cg 6 Ch. Cross-section (b) shows the H6/H8 ± (H2H ,H2HH ) NOE intranucleotide connectivities for the 11 nucleotides. T5, G6 and T7 were assigned through the assignment of a strong sequential connectivity between H1H ± T5 and H8 ± G6 (data not shown).

As explained in Materials and Methods, we have used high temperature molecular dynamics (MD) sampling and energy minimization to generate ten starting conformations for the T5pG6pT7 loop from 100 snapshots. After a run of restrained molecular dynamics (RMD) only ®ve of these ten starting conformations were found to be consistent with the NOE data. Figure 6 shows two different views of a superimposition of the ®ve conformations that are compatible with the NOE data. these ®ve conformations have no NOE violation Ê larger than 1 A, whereas the other ®ve conformations have at least one NOE violation larger Ê than 1 A. The force ®eld total energy varies between 63.2 and 72.6 kcal/mol for the accepted structures, whereas it varies between 73.5 and

112.0 kcal/mol for the discarded ones. The ®ve superimposed structures shown in Figure 7(a) and (b) have a root-mean-square (RMS) violation in the Ê stem varying between 0.76 and 0.98 A2, whereas the RMS violation in the loop varies between Ê Ê 0.11 A2 and 1.16 A2. The intercalation of the parallel C Á C base-pairs generates four edges: two narrow edges and two wide edges (see Figure 3). All C Á C base-pairs are ¯at without any propeller twist. The stability of the structure is provided by strong stacking and by electrostatic interactions involving N4H2 and N3H among neighboring C Á C pairs. Table 1 shows the conformational parameters for the average structure of (C4TGTC4)2. the NMR data suggest that all the nucleotides have an anti glycosidic torsion angle.

The 2H2O DQF-COSY spectrum was acquired with a sweep width of 5000 Hz, t2 size was 4096 points, 1024 tl increments were acquired in the TPPI mode with 32 transients each. The DQF-COSY spectrum was apodized with a squared-sine-bell (60 in t2 and 60 in tl) and zero-®lled to a ®nal 2048 Â 2048 data matrix with a digital resolution of 2.5 Hz/pt.

Figure 7 shows that the loop con®guration of the average structure of (C4TGTC4)2. G6 is horizontally stacked on the C8 Á C1 base-pair, and forms the following electrostatic interactions: N4H2(C1)N7(G6), N4H1(C1)-G6(06), N1H(G6)-N1(C1), N2H1(G6)-C1(02), N4H2(C8)-N2(G6); N1 and N3 of G6 interact with the proton of the C8 Á C1 basepair. T7 is stacked vertically and sits on top of a pocket formed by the two G6pT7 and T7pC8 phosphate groups and the sugar atoms of G6. T5 is in the narrow edge, stabilized by a couple of electrostatic interactions between its N3H, and (O2P and O5H ) of C8. Comparison of (C4TGTC4)2 with other i-motifs Inspection of the i-motif in (C4TGTC4)2 reveals two different kinds of steps with intercalating C Á C pairs. The two steps can be distinguished by the directions to which the phosphate groups are pointing. In step type 1, the two C Á C pairs face each other on the 5H side, and the phosphate groups are pointed inside the step. In step type 2, the two C Á C pairs face each other on the 3H side,

and the phosphate groups are pointed outward. In step type 1, the two wide edges are equivalent, as well as the two narrow edges, whereas in step type 2 the two narrow edges are not equivalent (see Figure 8(a)). Step 1 differs from step 2 also in terms of the orientation of the intercalating C Á C pairs. If we de®ne the angle (Z) between the two C Á C pairs involved in the step as the acute angle formed by the two vectors de®ned by the N3 atoms on each C Á C pair, then in our model we obtain values of 58.3 for step 1, and 51.5 for step 2 (see Figure 8(a)). We compared our hairpin i-motif of (C4TGTC4)2 with two i-motif structures formed by parallel duplexes of (C4)4 by X-ray crystallography (Chen et al., 1994), and for (TC2)4 by NMR (Leroy & Gueron, 1995). Although the i-motifs formed by parallel duplexes are quite similar, there are some differences in the phosphate orientations. In the (TC2)4 model, the two narrow edges are equivalent for both steps 1 and 2, whereas for the (C4TGTC4)2 and (C4)4 models, the narrow edges are non-equivalent (see Figure 8(a)). Steps 1 and 2 of (C4)4 are much thinner than in (C4TGTC4)2, with Z  87.5

Stereo views of the ®ve super-imposed representative structures of (C4TGTC4)2, which were found to give Ê the best agreement with the NMR data and belonged to the same cluster (maximum RMS < 1 A). The stereo superimposition is viewed normal to the helix axis. One of the two wide edges is in the front of the Figure. Note the eight intercalated C Á C parallel base-paired and the two symmetric T55pG6pT7 loops on each side of the i-motif. C Á C pairs are shown alternately in green and yellow color. T residues in the loop are drawn in cyan, G6 in the loop in magenta and backbone atoms are depicted in red.

for steps 1 and 2. respectively. (TC2)4 has step 1 more similar to (C4)4, with Z  70.0 and step two like (C4TGTC4)2 with Z  53.5 . It should be noted that we observed for the step type 1 of (C4TGTC4)2, the cup and plate shape as observed in crystallographic study of the human telomere repeat (CCCAAT; Berger et al., 1995). However, all models show substantially the same kind of intercalation motif, with stacking provided by the exocyclic groups rather than the cytidine rings. The main difference between the three i-motifs (Figure 9(a) and (b)) lies in the phosphate orientation. However, phosphate groups cannot be determined by using proton NMR. Therefore, we chose C5H -C5H distances to monitor edge sizes. In Figure 7(b) we report a comparison of the narrow and wide edges between (C4TGTC4)2, (C4)4, and (TC2)4 for step type 1, and differences appear to be minimal, although (C4TGTC4)2, and (C4)4 show more similarities with each other than with (TC2)4.

Modeling study of (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4) Figure 9 shows the 1D NMR specta of (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4) in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O at 20 C and at different pH values. Imino (N3H) protons of C residues are visible at chemical shifts below 15 ppm. although they are better de®ned at lower pH, imino protons of the C Á C pair begin to appear even at pH 6.8. The imino proton pro®le also indicates that the DNA molecule is completely folded at pH 5.5. Loop imino signals around 11 ppm are observed at pH values below 6.3. Figure 9 shows the broad envelop at around 9 ppm due to the amino protons of the A residues. However, because of the presence of both protonated and unprotonated states of C13 in the A12pC13pA14 segment, there is the possibility of more than one i-motif for this sequence; these conformers complicate NMR assignments and structure determination using 2D NMR. Because 1D NMR spectra indicate the presence of both loops and C Á C pairs we can conclude

that this longer DNA sequence forms an i-motif. One i-motif con®guration has to be the intramolecularly folded one, with eight C Á C pairs, two TpGpT loops on one side of the i-motif and an A12pC13pA14 loop on the other side. C13 protonation can also cause (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4) to form a parallel tract at the A12pC13pA14 fragment, resulting in a hairpin dimer, (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4)2, with an 11-mer stem, (C4ACAC4), forming an i-motif with a TpGpT loop on each side of the i-motif. Figure 10 shows both models, i.e. the intramolecularly folded structure, and the hairpin dimer, for (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4). In both these models, the TpGpT loops are constrained close to their observed structure in (C4TGTC4)2.

In vitro replication assay in the presence of the multiple hairpin C Á C paired i-motifs in (C4TGTC4ACA)6 Molecular modeling suggests that several hairpin i-motifs (Figure 10) can be linked in space for (C4TGTC4ACA)n with longer n (i.e. n  4, 6, 8, etc.). The presence of such a structure can be detected in an in vitro replication assay (Catasti et al 1996; Lapidot et al., 1989; Baran et al., 1991; Jaworski et al., 1995), whereby (C4TGTC4ACA)n repeats are inserted in the M13 single-stranded DNA template at speci®c BamHI restriction sites. As shown above, these sequences for n > 2 tend to form intramolecular folded hairpin i-motifs at acidic pH. Primer extension in the presence of the modi®ed T7 polymerase (Sequenase) at acidic pH should reveal the presence of this unusual DNA structure through replication arrests at periodic intervals when the polymerase encounters a C4

tract in the template. Figure 11(a) to (d) shows the data of the replication assay for the (C4TGTC4ACA)6 insert. The template is incubated at four different pH values (i.e. pH 5.9, 6.4, 7.1, and 7.6) prior to primer extension. At neutral pH values (57), a complete replication product including the insert (C4TGTC4ACA)6 and the sequences ¯anking the BamHI sites is obtained. Upon lowering the pH for template preincubation (especially at pH 5.9), the polymerase encounters preformed structures in the insert which cause replication arrests at the C4 tracts of the template. A strong arrest is observed at the beginning of the insert whereas the arrests become weaker at subsequent C4 tracts. The nature of this replication arrest is consistent with our hypothesis that longer ((C4TGTC4ACA)n inserts tend to form multiple (intramolecularly) folded hairpin i-motifs at slightly acidic pH values even in the presence of their complementary strands. In contrast, the presence of the shorter (C4TGTC4ACA)2 insert in the M13 DNA template, even at acidic pH, shows no replication arrest (data not shown). The in vitro replication data given in Figures 11(a) to (d) are consistent with the C-rich strands of the ILPR, (C4ACAC4TGT)n, forming the hairpin i-motif for n 5 6 even in the presence of its complementary strand, (ACAG4TGTG4)n. The potential therefore exists for the C-rich strand of the ILPR to form the same structure during in vivo replication. In vivo replication, however, involves in addition to DNA polymerase, several accessory proteins such as the single-strand DNA binding protein (SSB), helicase, primase, etc. Of particular importance is the SSB protein that removes secondary structures in the single-stranded DNA template to keep the template in-frame for chain elongation.

Figure 7. Top view looking down the helix axis of the T5pG6pT7 loop and the top intercalated C Á C base-pairs of the average minimized structure of (C4TGTC4)2 from the cluster of ®ve shown in Figure 6. The representative NOEs that characterized the ®nal structure shown are indicated as yellow broken lines. Atoms involved in these NOEs are also labeled.

Therefore, we have investigated the effects of Escherichia coli SSB on the presumed hairpin i-motif formed by the C-rich strand of the ILPR at pH 5.9 resulting in the arrests in DNA replication when the DNA polymerase encounters C4 tracts in the template (Figure 11(d)). As shown in Figure 11(e), when SSB protein is included in this DNA replication experiment at pH 5.9, no replication arrests are observed. Thus, structures formed by the (C4ACAC4TGT)6 insert, which is presumed to be the hairpin i-motif, are removed by the SSB protein. We have investigated further the ability of the SSB protein to unwind the hairpin i-motif formed by the C-rich strand of the ILPR. Figure 12(a) shows the gel mobility of (C4ACAC4TGT)2 and pH 5, 6 and 7. In this gel, the faster moving band that corresponds to the ordered i-motif, does not completely resolve from the slower moving band due to the coil, although its apparent that the ordered (i-motif) population increases in acidic pH values. However, in a longer gel (included as a Supplementary Material Figure) the two bands corresponding to the ordered i-motif and the coil of the C-rich strand of the ILPR can be resolved. The E. coli SSB protein is expected to bind in one of the following two ways: either it binds only the singlestranded coil structure of the C-rich strand of the

ILPR or in addition to binding the coil, it also binds the ordered i-motif by converting it into a coil. The ®rst mechanism of binding should involve no change in the ordered i-motif structure upon protein binding, whereas the second mechanism should lead to a reduction in the ordered structure upon protein binding. Figure 12(a) also shows the binding of the E. coli SSB protein to (C4ACAC4TGT)2 at different pH values. there is a clear reduction in the ordered i-motif population upon protein binding. this reduction is smaller at acidic pH values relative to neutral pH because the population (and stability) of the ordered i-motif are enhanced at acidic pH values. Figure 12(b) shows the gel-shift binding data of (C4ACAC4TGT)6. For this repeat length, a signi®cant portion of the C-rich strand remains unbound to the E. coli SSB. The unbound species of (C4ACAC4TGT)6 is predominantly in the ordered (i-motif) form. Therefore, it appears that the E. coli SSB protein not only binds the coil but also converts the hairpin i-motif of the C-rich strand into a coil. This conclusion is further con®rmed by the complete release of the replication arrest in the (C4ACAC4TGT)6 template when both Sequenase and E. coli SSB are present during in vitro replication (see Figure 11(e)).

Discussion
Here we report structural studies of three different sequences of the ILPR: (i) the high resolution NMR structure of (C4TGTC4); (ii) 1D NMR and molecular modeling studies of (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4); and (iii) in vitro replication studies on (C4TGTC4ACA)2,6. 1D NMR spectra of (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4) reveal the presence of only C Á C pairs of acidic pH, which implies that as for (C4TGTC4) this sequence also forms and intramolecularly folded C Á C paired i-motif. The possibility of intramolecularly folded i-motif structures suggests that two or more i-motifs can be linked in space in (C4TGGTC4ACA)n, when n is 4 or more. In vitro replication data on (C4TGTC4ACA)6 support this proposal. The replication assay shows unequivocally that a suf®ciently long C-rich strand (n  6 in our case) of the ILPR forms a structure that blocks progression of replication

As indicated, the template was pre-incubated at four different pH values (panels (a) to (d), left to right, pH 5.9, 6.4, 7.1, and 7.6) before primer extension with Sequenase. Note that the 17 nucleotide long primer is about 40 nucleotides away from the insert. The nature of the replication product (i.e. G4TGTG4ACAG4) shows arrests when the polymerase encounters the C4 tract in the template.

even in the presence of its complementary strand. This structure is most probably the hairpin C Á C paired i-motif, which can be resolved by the addition of the SSB protein promoting progression of replication. The present work has both structural and biological signi®cance. Although formation of the i-motif structures through hairpin folding has been reported (Leroy et al., 1994; Rohozinski et al., 1994; Ahmed et al., 1994), these studies lacked the exact structural details of the hairpin folding and the nature of C Á C intercalation. Our high resolution NMR structural determination of the hairpin dimer of (C4TGTC4) provides, for the ®rst time, such

structural details. Highly resolved NMR spectra of the exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons of (C4TGTC4) allow us to arrive at the sequential assignments independent of a prior assumption of any structure. High resolution spectra also allow us to extract 340 NOE distance constraints fro structure derivation. In previous studies, the experimental techniques used or the resolution of the NMR spectra did not allow derivation of high resolution structures as we are able to accomplish for (C4TGTC4)2. Previously, Hammond-Cosack et al. (1992) suggested that the G-rich strand of the ILPR forms a G-quartet structure, whereas the C-rich strand is unstructured at neutral pH. The studies reported here demonstrate that the C-rich strand of the ILPR can partially be ordered into a C Á C paired structure even at neutral pH. The in vitro replication data also indicate that similar to the G-quartet structures, the C Á C paired i-motif structures of the C-rich strand can also be present

380 during replication at mildly acidic pH. The possibility of intramolecularly folded structures for both the G-rich and the C-rich strands signi®cantly

enhances the possibility of slippage during replication of the ILPR. Formation of unwound structures by both strands upstream of the insulin gene should also facilitate transcription (Catasti et al., 1996) similar to that describes for triplex (Durland et al., 1991), H-DNA (Mirkin et al., 1987), and cruciform structures (Greaves et al., 1985).

Materials and Methods
Oligonucleotide synthesis and purification The oligonucleotides (C4TGTC4) and (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4) were synthesized by the solid phase phosphoramidate method using an Applied Biosystem synthesizer. The oligomers were puri®ed by passing through a Sephadex column followed by several cycles of ethanol precipitation and lyophilization. NMR sample preparation Approximately 7 mg of (C4TGTC4) and 15 mg of (C4TGTC4ACAC4TGTC4) (®nal concentrations 4 mM in strand) were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 2H2O for nonexchangeable proton NMR experiments, and in 90% H2O/2H2O for exchangeable proton NMR experiments. for all the samples, the buffer consisted of a 25 mM solution of phosphate buffer, and 25 mM NaCl. The ®nal Na concentration was 50 mM. Final pH and p2H were titrated to 5.0 adding microaliquotes of NaO2H and 2 HCl. NMR experiments All the NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer. The NMR data were processed on a Silicon Graphics workstation with Felix software (version 2.3, Biosym Tech., Inc.). A shifted-square-sinebell function (shift of 80 in tl and 70 in t2) was used for all the 2D NOESY/2H2O and WATERGATE-2D NOESY/H2O data (Piotto et al., 1992; Sklenar et al., 1993). The same window function but with a shift of 60 in both dimensions was used for processing the DQFCOSY data. Data were zero-®lled to (tl  1024,t2  1024) real points before Fourier transformation. NOESY crosspeak volumes were obtained by the volume integration routine in the Felix software using a manual peak-picking routine. All 2D experiments were run at 10 C and chemical shift values were ,measured with respect to the HDO signal kept at 4.75 ppm. One-dimensional proton spectra in 90% H2O/10% 2h2O were recorded using the WATERGATE water-suppression method and keeping the excitation maximum near the base-paired imino proton. Full matrix NOE refinement Pair-wise average distances (and their ranges) for the non-exchangeable protons of (C1-C2-C3-C4-T5-G6-T7C8-C9-C10-C11) were obtained by re®ning the R-factor (ÆjIo À Icj/ÆIo) with the aid of a linked-atom leastsquares procedure in conjunction with full-matrix NOESY simulations with respect to the observed data 100% 2h2O at 75 and 300 ms of mixing (Catasti et al., 1994; Gupta et al., 1993); where Io and Ic are observed and calculated NOESY intensities, respectively. Pair-wise distances involving exchangeable protons were qualitat-

Note that the C-rich strand of the (ILPR)2 migrates faster at a more acidic pH. Lanes 6 to 10 show the same in presence of SSB, with lanes 8 to 10 showing the binding of SSB to (C4ACAC4TGT)2, respectively, at pH 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. The C-rich strand of the ILPR shows a stronger binding to SSB than the G-rich strand. Also, SSB binds more ef®ciently the C-rich strand of (ILPR)2 at neutral pH.

Restrained molecular dynamics An initial model for (C4TGTC4)2 was constructed through the following steps. (1) Three H-bonded C Á C pairs were constructed in which one C was protonated at N3. This type of pairing is possible only if two C4 tracts associate in parallel orientation. (2) A parallel Ê (C4)2 DNA duplex was constructed with a 6.8 A separation between two neighboring C Á C pairs. (3) Two such identical d(C4)2 duplexes were intercalated using a 2-fold symmetry; this resulted in a (C4)4 tetramer with four C4 tracts. (4) Two symmetric T5pG6pT7 loops were connected on the two sides of (C4)4 (see Figure 3). The T5pG6pT7 loops were taken from the structure obtained for (G4TGTG4)2 (Catasti et al., 1996; and unpublished results). The initial model for (C4TGTC4)2 was minimized to a Ê ®nal gradient lower than 10À2 kcal/mol per A using 500 steps of conjugate gradients followed by steepest descent method. In order to sample all the possible loop con®gurations, the system was equilibrated at 600 K and subjected to 400 ps of molecular dynamics. Distance constraints were also added for the hydrogen bonds in the stem and torsional constraints were used to maintain the correct sugar puckering for the C residues in the stem (d  85(Æ15) for C3H -endo, and d  135(Æ20) for C2H -endo), and the correct glycosidic angle for the bases in the loops (w   60). Snapshots (100) were taken from the MD trajectory every 4 ps and minimized to a ®nal gradiÊ ent lower than 10À2 kcal/mol per A. The 100 minimized structures were clustered in ten families of RMS deviÊ ation lower than 4 A. A total of 340 distance constraints from NMR data were added to the force ®eld (152 NOEs involving non-exchangeable resonances in the stem, 100 NOEs involving non-exchangeable resonances in the loop and 168 NOEs involving exchangeable resonances in the stem). One representative structure was chosen from each cluster; it was equilibrated at 300 K and subjected to 80 ps of restrained molecular dynamics. Snapshots (20) were taken every 4 ps for each of the ten families and minimized to a ®nal gradient lower than Ê 10À3 kcal/mol per A. Torsional and distance restraints were kept on during all the MD calculations. The spring constant was 8 kcal/mol per rad for the torsional conÊ straints, 2 kcal/mol per A for the NOEs involving only Ê non-exchangeable resonances and 1 kcal/mol per A for the NOEs involving only exchangeable resonances. The 20 minimized structures belonging to each family Ê showed a RMS lower than 1 A. An average structure was taken for each family and minimized to a ®nal graÊ dient lower than 10À3kcal/mol per A. All the RMD calculations were performed by using AMBER (version 4.0; Pearlman et al., 1991) on a SGI Indigo workstation. Calculations were done in vacuum including all non-bonding pairs of interactions, and with a dielectric constant of 4. All other energy terms were calculated using the all-atom force ®eld described by Weiner et al. (1986). In vitro replication assay In vitro replication experiments for the C-rich strand of the insulin minisatellite were performed using the dideoxy chain termination DNA sequencing method

381
(Maxam & Gilbert, 1992). All the experiments were carried out at room temperature. Denaturing solutions were prepared by adding 0.5 mg (about 0.25 pmol) of the single-stranded DNA template and 0.5 pmol of the M13 sequencing primer in a 25 mM Tris buffer solution containing 7.5 mM MgSO4, and 20 mM KCl. The buffer solution was adjusted to different pH values: pH 5.9, 6.4, 7.1 and 7.6. The solutions were denatured for ®ve minutes at 95 C, gradually cooled to 55 C over a period of two hours, and equilibrated overnight at room temperature before starting the chain elongation reaction. The labeling reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of 1 ml, 0.1 M DTT, 2 ml of diluted labeling mix (4 mM dGTP, 1.7 mM dATP, and 1.7 mM dTTP), 1 ml of 0.25 mCi [32P]dCTP, and Sequenase (T7 DNA polymerase from United States Biochemical). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for ®ve minutes. After the chain extension, 4 ml of the labeling reaction mixture were transferred into each termination tube (G, T, A and C) and the incubation was continued at 37 C for ®ve minutes. The reactions were stopped by adding 4 ml of stop solution (from United States Biochemical). Each sample was heated to 90 C for two minutes before loading on the sequencing gel. (Felsenfeld, 1993).
