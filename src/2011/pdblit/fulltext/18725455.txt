Abstract Bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a multifunctional biotin-dependent enzyme that consists of three separate proteins: biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and carboxyltransferase (CT). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a potentially attractive target for novel antibiotics because it catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis. In the first half-reaction, BC catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of BCCP. In the second half-reaction, the carboxyl group is transferred from carboxybiotinylated BCCP to acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. A series of structures of BC from several bacteria crystallized in the presence of various ATP analogs is described that addresses three major questions concerning the catalytic mechanism. The structure of BC bound to AMPPNP and the two catalytically essential magnesium ions resolves inconsistencies between the kinetics of active-site BC mutants and previously reported BC structures. Another structure of AMPPNP bound to BC shows the polyphosphate chain folded back on itself, and not in the correct (i.e., extended) conformation for catalysis. This provides the first structural evidence for the hypothesis of substrate-induced synergism, which posits that ATP binds nonproductively to BC in the absence of biotin. The BC homodimer has been proposed to exhibit half-sites reactivity where the active sites alternate or ``flip-flop'' their catalytic cycles. A crystal structure of BC showed the ATP analog AMPPCF2P bound to one subunit while the other subunit was unliganded. The liganded subunit was in the closed or catalytic conformation while the unliganded subunit was in the open conformation. This provides the first structural evidence for half-sites reactivity in BC.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis in animals, plants, and bacteria. In bacteria, acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a multimeric complex that consists of three separate proteins: biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and carboxyltransferase (CT) (Cronan and Waldrop 2002). In eukaryotes, all three functions are combined within a single polypeptide (Tanabe et al. 1975). In the first half-reaction, BC catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of the carboxyl group from bicarbonate to biotin of biotinylated BCCP (Scheme 1). In the second half-reaction, the carboxyl group is transferred from

carboxybiotinylated BCCP to acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA and regenerate biotinylated BCCP. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Escherichia coli is a model system for studying structural and functional aspects of the BC and CT proteins because the isolated enzymes retain their catalytic activity and can utilize free substrate biotin instead of biotin covalently attached to BCCP. The first apo crystal structure of biotin carboxylase from E. coli (EcBC) (Waldrop et al. 1994) revealed that the enzyme was a homodimer where each subunit had a complete active site (i.e., the active site was not shared between subunits). These structural data laid the groundwork for subsequent sitedirected mutagenesis studies that identified catalytically important residues of BC (Blanchard et al. 1999b; Levert et al. 2000; Sloane et al. 2001; Sloane and Waldrop 2004). However, questions concerning the specific roles of these residues in catalysis remained unanswered because the initial BC crystal structure did not contain any substrates bound to the active site. A three-dimensional structure of an inactive E288K active-site mutant of EcBC in complex with ATP was subsequently solved to shed light on the molecular interactions between the protein and the ATP substrate (Thoden et al. 2000a). However, enzyme kinetics data of several site-directed mutants were inconsistent with some of the molecular interactions observed in the crystal structure, bringing into question whether the structure of the E288K active-site mutant was an accurate representation of the substrate-binding mode (Sloane et al. 2001). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the mutant enzyme did not contain magnesium ions at the active site, even though the enzyme requires two equivalents of magnesium for catalytic activity (Climent and Rubio 1986). Previously published kinetic data indicated that BC hydrolyzes ATP very slowly in the absence of biotin (Blanchard et al. 1999b). However, the rate of ATP hydrolysis increases 1100-fold in the presence of biotin (Blanchard et al. 1999b). This substrate-induced synergism was interpreted as the nonproductive binding of ATP to BC in the absence of biotin which could then become productive binding in the presence of the biotin substrate (Blanchard et al. 1999a). Secondly, kinetic analysis of heterodimers of BC combined with numerical simulation suggested that BC can exhibit a form of negative cooperativity or half-sites reactivity where one active site of the homodimer is undergoing catalysis while the other one is releasing the product (Janiyani et al. 2001; de

Queiroz and Waldrop 2007). However, structural data supporting these mechanistic features, showing substrate bound to only one subunit of BC dimer, were not available in these previous studies. Herein, we describe a series of crystal structures of biotin carboxylase from Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli that provide structural and functional insights into BC activity and inhibition. First, a threedimensional structure of wild-type BC from S. aureus (SaBC) reveals two magnesium ions coordinated by the phosphate group of the ATP analog AMPPNP and the active-site residues of BC. Second, the EcBC/AMPPNP crystal structure describes a nonproductive binding mode of the ATP substrate that supports substrate-induced synergism in BC. Third, the crystal structure of EcBC in complex with ADPCF2P bound to only one subunit of the homodimer provides structural evidence of the half-sites reactivity in BC. Together, these crystal structures offer a more complete data set supporting a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of bacterial BC and offer important information for efforts targeting this enzyme for the discovery and design of novel antibacterial agents (Campbell and Cronan Jr. 2001; Zhang et al. 2006), which are desperately needed given the dramatic rise in antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria (Levy 2005). Results Overall structure The overall structures of BC from S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (PaBC) were similar to those of the BC domains from E. coli (PDB codes 1dv1 and 1dv2) (Waldrop et al. 1994; Thoden et al. 2000a), Aquifex aeolicus (PDB code 1ulz) (Kondo et al. 2004), and Bacillus thermodenitrificans (PDB code 2dzd) (Kondo et al. 2007). The overall structure could exist in open and closed conformations and consisted of three domains: N-terminal, central (ATP-grasp), and C-terminal (Fig. 1A). In the open form (apo PaBC structure and the unliganded EcBC monomer in the ADPCF2P complex), the ATP-grasp domain was splayed significantly from the main-domain body consisting of the N- and C-terminal domains. The binding of the nucleotide molecule induced a substantial structural rearrangement to the closed conformation when the ATP-grasp domain rotated about the hinge region by ;45° to grasp the nucleotide molecule.

interactions at the dimer interface are summarized in Table 1. An average interface area for the SaBC dimer calculated using the PISA program (Krissinel and Henrick ° 2007) was 1310 A2, or only 7% of the total solventaccessible surface area, suggesting weak interactions. Analysis of contacts at the interfaces of the BC dimers revealed many conserved hydrogen-bonding and ionic interactions primarily between residues of the a1 and a12 helices and residues of the loop connecting the b16 and b17 strands (Table 1). The ability of BC to form homodimers in the crystals was consistent with size exclusion chromatography experiments (data not shown) indicating that EcBC exists as monomers at higher salt concentrations (>500 mM) and reversibly forms dimers under low ionic strength conditions. Analysis of the ATP-binding site of BC Electron density maps (Fig. 2A­D) were used to interpret binding modes of the ATP analogs to the binding site. Briefly, electron density was continuous and well-defined for all atoms of AMPPNP in the complex with SaBC, AMPCP in the complex with PaBC, and AMPPNP in the complex with EcBC. The average thermal factors (average B-values) of the ligands are listed in Table 2. Electron density of AMPPCF2P contoured at 1s level (Fig. 2D) was not continuous and consisted of two regions. One region corresponded to the adenine and ribose groups and the other to the tri-phosphate group. (Two separate regions of electron density become connected at a contour level of 0.85s or lower.) Weak electron density and high B-values of AMPPCF2P (Table 2) suggested that the ATP analog had lower occupancy in the crystal structure, which can be a result of its low binding affinity for BC (data not shown). In cases when the ATP analogs bound to two protein molecules of the dimer (Table 2), electron density, B-values, and a binding mode of the ligands are consistent between the molecules. The BC ATP-binding site can be arbitrarily divided into three distinctive regions: (1) adenine-binding site, (2) ribose-binding site, and (3) phosphate-binding site. The adenine-binding region of BC consisted of the E201­ L204, I157­K159, L278, and I287 structural segments (sequence and numbering of EcBC) with the majority of the key residues being highly conserved across different species (Table 3). Adjacent to the adenine site, the ribosebinding region was formed by the side chains of residues H209, Q233, H236, and H438 positioned to accommodate the ribose group of the nucleotide (Fig. 3A­C). The phosphate-binding site included residues K116, K159, and the glycine-rich loop (residues 161­168) that coordinated the phosphate groups of the substrate (Fig. 3A­C). The glycine-rich loop of BC is homologous to the T-loop present in glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (Thoden

Upon nucleotide binding, the ATP-grasp domain tilts ;45° toward the N- and C-terminal domains (structural changes are shown by the dotted arrows). In the AMPCP-bound complex, the overall protein conformation is similar to those in the crystal structures of SaBC and EcBC complexed with AMPPNP. The AMPCP molecule is colored in the following atom colors: carbon, yellow; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; phosphorus, orange.

Ribbon representation is colored from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus). The interface area includes a loop connecting the b16 and b17 strands and a1 and a12 helices.

This large conformational change upon the nucleotide binding is the signature structural feature of the ATP-grasp superfamily of enzymes (Galperin and Koonin 1997) and has been reported in the crystal structures of the BC domains of yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylase (PDB code 1w930) (Shen et al. 2004), pyruvate carboxylase from Aquifex aeolicus (Kondo et al. 2004), and Rhizobium etli (PDB code 2qf7) (St. Maurice et al. 2007). In the crystals, BC formed homodimers (Fig. 1B) related by a twofold rotation axis. Protein­protein 1708

et al. 2002) and the P-loop found in kinases and will be referred to, hereafter, as the BC P-loop. The loop connected two adjacent antiparallel b-strands and consisted of a highly conserved residue segment ASGGGGRG (Table 3), which was partially disordered in the PaBC apo crystal structure but became ordered upon the nucleotide binding (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the substrate-binding modes Analysis of the BC crystal structures in complex with AMPPNP revealed two distinctive binding modes (Fig. 4). In the SaBC/AMPPNP complex, which was cocrystallized in the presence of biotinylated BCCP,7 the substrate binds in the extended conformation positioning the gphosphate group in a proper stereochemical orientation for the catalytic reaction. The conformation of AMPPNP,
7 While the presence of BCCP was needed in the crystallization medium to grow the SaBC/AMPPNP crystals that diffracted to a sufficient resolution, crystal structure determination indicated that BCCP was not present in the refined complex. It is important to point out that BCCP or a co-substrate is not needed to obtain a conformation of ATP with an extended polyphosphate chain. For instance, the structure of an active-site mutant of EcBC with ATP bound did not have BCCP in the crystallization medium yet it showed the phosphate chain in the extended conformation (Thoden et al. 2000a). Moreover, crystal structures of other members of the ATP-grasp superfamily of enzymes all have ATP in virtually the same conformation as that found in SaBC/AMPPNP, yet none of those structures contained a cosubstrate (Fan et al. 1994; Hara et al. 1996; Thoden et al. 1999b, 2000b). Thus, BCCP was needed to grow the SaBC/AMPPNP crystals that diffracted to a sufficient resolution but is probably not a prerequisite for the polyphosphate chain to be in the extended conformation.

especially the polyphosphate chain, is similar to the conformation of ATP analogs found in other enzymes from the ATP-grasp superfamily: D-Ala:D-Ala ligase (Fan et al. 1994), glutathione synthetase (Hara et al.

Moreover, the conformation of ATPgS in the BC domain of pyruvate carboxylase also agrees with the SaBC/AMPPNP structure (St. Maurice et al. 2007). This overwhelming precedence strongly suggests the SaBC/AMPPNP complex is indicative of the reactive conformation. 1710

In contrast, in the EcBC/AMPPNP complex the substrate binds in a curled catalytically inactive conformation folding the g-phosphate group back on itself (Fig. 4). This conformation of an ATP analog has never been observed before in other ATP-grasp enzymes. The curled or folded back conformation of the polyphosphate chain in the EcBC/AMPPNP structure is unlikely to be the result of crystal packing since the nucleotide analog or

any sections of the protein that interact with it are not involved in any direct crystal contacts with the neighboring molecules. In spite of different binding modes, the adenine and ribose groups of the substrate were engaged in a similar network of interactions with the protein (Figs. 3A­D,4). Structural features of the adenine-binding site involved in the recognition of the adenine base included: (1) hydrogenbond donor and hydrogen-bond acceptor interactions between the N6 and N1 atoms of adenine and the backbone atoms of the K202­L204 hinge region; (2) hydrogen-

bond interaction between the N6 amine group and the sidechain of E201; and (3) hydrophobic contacts between the adenine ring system and the side-chains of I157 and L278. At the ribose-binding site, the ribose hydroxyl groups of AMPPNP utilized hydrogen-bond interactions with the side-chain atoms of histidine-207 (Fig. 3A­D), which corresponds to a glutamic acid in the related ATPgrasp enzymes, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (Thoden et al. 1999b), glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (Thoden et al. 2000b), and N5-carboxylaminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (Thoden et al. 1999a).

Magnesium-binding sites The crystal structure of SaBC in complex with AMPPNP revealed for the first time two magnesium ions bound at the active site (Fig. 5A). Identification of two magnesium-binding sites structurally supports the kinetic data demonstrating that the enzyme requires two equivalents of magnesium for activity, one of which is chelated to ATP so that the metal­nucleotide complex is the substrate (Climent and Rubio 1986). In the crystal structure, both magnesium ions were octahedrally coordinated (Fig. 5A). Intermolecular contacts of each Mg2+ ion were similar to those observed in the BC domain of pyruvate carboxylase (St. Maurice et al. 2007), glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (Thoden et al. 2000b), and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, which had manganese substituted for magnesium (Thoden et al. 1999b). In addition, these structural data confirm molecular dynamics simulations of EcBC with ATP and the two magnesium ions bound to the active site (Nilsson Lill et al. 2008). As shown in Figure 5A, one of the magnesium ions (B-value of 16.71 ° ° A2 [monomer A] and 29.47 A2 [monomer B]) was ° coordinated to oxygen atoms of the b-(2.3 A) and g° (1.8 A) phosphate groups of AMPPNP, the side-chain ° oxygen atom of E288 (2.4 A), and three water molecules. ° The other magnesium ion (B-value of 18.75 A2 [monomer ° chain A] and 27.48 A2 [monomer B]) was coordinated ° ° to the oxygen atoms of the a-(2.1 A) and g-(2.0 A) phosphate groups of the ligand, two side-chain oxygen ° ° atoms of E274 (2.1 A, 2.6 A) (SaBC numbering), a water molecule, and one oxygen atom of the E288 side chain ° (2.5 A).

BC ribose-binding site exhibits subtle differences with the other members of the ATP-grasp superfamily. The crystal structures indicated that the ability of the ATP-binding site to accommodate the substrate in multiple conformations resulted in part from the flexible Ploop, which covered the phosphate groups of the nucleotide molecules. The P-loop was disordered in the PaBC structures of the unliganded enzyme; however, upon the nucleotide binding, the loop can become ordered by forming interactions with nucleotide (Figs. 1A, 3A­D). While the P-loop becomes ordered upon nucleotide binding, the loop conformation can depend on the bound nucleotide. For example, Thoden et al. (2002) observed that the T-loop in the ATP-grasp enzyme glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase was very flexible and able to adopt several different conformations depending on the bound ATP analogs. However, for each analog the polyphosphate chain was in the extended conformation. The conformational flexibility of the P-loop is consistent with our crystal structures in that its ability to adopt multiple conformations means that the active site can accommodate multiple binding modes of ATP. Moreover, at the phosphate-binding site of the SaBC/AMPPNP crystal structure, the backbone nitrogen atoms of residues G162, G163, and G164 (residues G164­G166 in EcBC) of the P-loop formed hydrogen bonds to the b- and g-phosphate groups of substrate, providing the proper positioning of the phosphate group of ATP for catalysis. As discussed below the significance of the P-loop for catalysis is confirmed by mutagenesis of P-loop residues which decrease the catalytic rate 100-fold. 1712

° E276 (2.4 A) (PaBC numbering) and E288 side chains ° ) (Fig. 5B). (1.9 A Binding of ADPCF2P to biotin carboxylase The crystal structure of EcBC in complex with the ATP analog ADPCF2P revealed that the ligand was bound to one subunit of BC while the other subunit was unliganded (Fig. 6A). The subunit with the bound ATP analog was in the closed conformation. In contrast, the unliganded subunit is in the open conformation observed when the enzyme does not have any substrates bound (Waldrop et al. 1994). This structure was consistent with the model of oscillating active sites (Janiyani et al. 2001; de Queiroz and Waldrop 2007), where the two subunits of BC

alternate catalytic reactions such that, while one subunit is binding substrate and undergoing catalysis, the other subunit is releasing product (Fig. 6B). It must be noted from the analysis of crystal packing that different residues of the a7 helix (residues D143­R150) in the central (ATP-grasp) domain are involved in crystal contacts with a symmetry mate (Fig. 6C,D; Supplemental material), thereby suggesting the possibility that the conformation can be influenced by crystal packing. Nonetheless, given that previous structures of BC showed the central domain of both subunits either in the closed (Thoden et al. 2000a) or open conformation (Waldrop et al. 1994), the asymmetric structure presented here demonstrates that it is structurally feasible for the two subunits of the enzyme to exist in ``mixed'' conformations, which just so happens to

correlate very well with experimental (Janiyani et al. 2001) and theoretical studies (de Queiroz and Waldrop 2007). If the two subunits of BC do in fact oscillate their cycles of catalysis, this would undoubtedly require residues at the dimer interface to be involved in intersubunit communication. A comparison of the dimer interface for the structures of apo EcBC (Thoden et al. 2000a) and apo PaBC and EcBC where only one subunit has ligand bound reveals a significant conformational change. The structure with no ligands shows that R331 forms a face-to-face side-chain interaction with the corresponding R331 in the other monomer (Fig. 6E). In contrast, in the structure with only one subunit containing ligand, the two arginine residues at position 331 are no longer facing each other but fully extended in an end-toface fashion toward the neighboring subunit to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of threonine304 (Fig. 6F). Such Arg­Arg interactions have been shown to be thermodynamically favorable and play a major role at protein interfaces (Brinda and Vishveshwara 2005; Mukherjee and Bagchi 2006). These arginines are located at the edge of the subunit interface and are exposed to solvent, which could help stabilize the interaction. Whether this conformational change is in fact involved in subunit­subunit communication will have to await further biological experiments. Discussion Toward an understanding of the biotin carboxylase catalytic mechanism Previous kinetic and structural data pointed to some intriguing characteristics of the BC enzyme including substrate-induced synergism and half-sites reactivity. To further investigate these properties, we solved the structures of wild-type BC from several different bacteria in the presence of several ATP analogs. These new structures include the catalytically essential magnesium ions and reveal previously unrecognized features of the BC active site providing further insight into several previously published hypotheses on BC catalysis. These new structures offer resolution of several apparent inconsistencies between kinetic and structural data gathered with active-site mutants of BC and provide additional support for substrate-induced synergism and alternating half-sites reactivity. Biological relevance of the ATP-binding modes To critically assess the biological relevance of the crystal structure ATP-binding modes, the previously determined kinetic properties of several EcBC mutant proteins were 1714

reevaluated in light of the new structural data gathered in this study. Site-directed K159Q mutant The site-directed K159Q mutant of BC had a 90-fold greater Km value for ATP, emphasizing the important role of lysine-159 in the binding of the substrate (Sloane et al. 2001). This supports both binding modes (i.e., extended and curled) of ATP observed in our crystal structures, where K159 (residue K157 in SaBC) hydrogen bonds to the N7 of the adenine base and one of the oxygen atoms of the a- or g-phosphate group (Fig. 2A­C). These intermolecular contacts are consistent with the other members of the ATP-grasp superfamily, where the homologous residue interacts with the a-phosphate oxygens (Fan et al. 1994; Hara et al. 1996; Thoden et al. 1999b, 2002). In contrast, in the crystal structure of the BC E288K mutant (Thoden et al. 2000a) lysine-159 did not interact with the ATP molecule, suggesting that the mutant structure may not be an accurate representation of the substrate-binding mode in BC. Site-directed G165V, G166V, and K116Q mutants The importance of the P-loop that interacts with the phosphate groups of ATP in the crystal structures was underscored by mutagenesis studies, where replacement of Gly165 and Gly166 with valine resulted in increased Km values for ATP and a 100-fold decrease in the maximal velocity (Bordelon et al. 2008). In addition to the P-loop, lysine-116 of the phosphate-binding region plays a critical role in binding the nucleotide phosphates. In our crystal structures, K116 (residue K115 in SaBC) coordinates the oxygen atom of the a-phosphate group in the extended ATP conformation (Fig. 2A,C) or the b- and g-phosphate groups in the curled ATP conformation (Fig. 2B). This is supported by a site-directed mutagenesis experiment where mutation of K116 to glutamine resulted in a 50-fold increase in the Km for ATP (Sloane et al. 2001). It is important to note that either lysine or arginine is observed in the other members of the ATP-grasp family at the position equivalent to K116 (Galperin and Koonin 1997). Site-directed R292A mutant One of the major differences between the substratebinding modes of bacterial BC and that of other enzymes in the ATP-grasp superfamily is residue R292. While in ° bacterial BC, arginine-292 was almost 4 A away from the g-phosphate group involved in the catalytic reaction, the equivalent residue R845 of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase formed direct hydrogen bonds with the g-phosphate (Thoden et al. 1999b). In this respect, it is important to note that the lack of interactions between arginine-292 in

Crystallographic studies of biotin carboxylase

BC and the substrate was consistent with the mutagenesis experiments, where the R292A mutant had a Km value for ATP similar to wild type (Blanchard et al. 1999b). Structural evidence for substrate-induced synergism in BC The results of previous kinetic studies demonstrated that BC catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of biotin 1100 times faster than in its absence (Blanchard et al. 1999b). The dramatic increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of biotin is an example of substrate-induced synergism, a phenomenon especially common in enzymes that utilize ATP, including hexokinase (Herschlag 1988). It is likely an evolutionary adaptation that prevents the enzyme from wasting ATP by allowing ATP to be efficiently hydrolyzed only when all the substrates are bound. The mechanism of substrateinduced synergism in BC is thought to stem from ATP binding to BC in several nonproductive modes in the absence of biotin. However, in the presence of biotin, the number of nonproductive binding modes decreases or is eliminated, resulting in an increased rate of ATP hydrolysis (Blanchard et al. 1999b). If nonproductive binding of ATP is the explanation for substrate-induced synergism, then ATP should bind to BC in a conformation other than extended, which is observed in the SaBC/AMPPNP crystal structure (Fig. 2A). The crystal structure of EcBC/AMPPNP, which was crystallized in the absence of biotin or biotinylated BCCP, shows an alternative substrate-binding mode in which the phosphate chain is curled back on itself (Fig. 2B). This alternative binding mode is an example of nonproductive binding because the g-phosphate group of the substrate is not in the correct position to react with bicarbonate, and to our knowledge is the first structural evidence of the substrate-induced synergism in BC. Structural evidence for half-sites reactivity in BC The crystal structures described here demonstrate that BC from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria exists as a homodimer where each subunit contains a complete active site. When monomers of BC were generated by disrupting the dimer interface via site-directed mutagenesis, the monomers had ;32% the enzymatic activity of wild type (Shen et al. 2006). Therefore, if each monomer has a complete active site and has activity, then why did the enzyme evolve as a homodimer? Quaternary structure in a protein is frequently associated with communication between subunits. The BC homodimer was found to exhibit an extreme form of negative cooperativity called half-sites reactivity, where the two subunits are unable to catalyze the reaction

simultaneously (Janiyani et al. 2001; de Queiroz and Waldrop 2007). Instead, the two subunits alternate catalytic reactions such that, while one subunit is binding substrate and undergoing catalysis, the other subunit is releasing product. The structure of EcBC in Figure 6A, where the subunit with the ATP analog ADPCF2P bound is in the closed conformation while the other subunit is unliganded and in the open conformation, provides the first structural evidence for the model of oscillating active sites. If the ADPCF2P bound structure is in fact a snapshot of the catalytic sequence, then does it provide any insight into how the conformational change is coupled to substrate binding? The residue at the subunit­subunit interface, R331 (Fig. 6E), which changes conformation in the ADPCF2P bound structure, was also implicated by molecular dynamics simulations as playing a role in the conformational change associated with nucleotide binding (Nilsson Lill et al. 2008). The computational study suggested that not only was the interface residue R331 involved in the conformational change but it worked in concert with the active-site residue K238, thereby providing a link between the active site and subunit interface (Nilsson Lill et al. 2008). Moreover, a K238Q mutant of BC exhibited a basal level of ATP hydrolysis which did not increase as a function of biotin (Levert et al. 2000). Based on the crystal structure of pyruvate carboxylase (St. Maurice et al. 2007), biotin is the substrate that initiates the switching between active sites. Thus, the active-site half (K238) of the pair of residues does play a role in the oscillating catalytic cycles. While there is relatively limited precedence for oscillating cycles of catalysis by enzymes, the number of examples is growing. For instance, the homodimer of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase was studied by singlemolecule fluorescence and the simplest interpretation of the data was oscillation of the catalytic cycles of the subunits (Shi et al. 2006). Moreover, HOPDA (2-hydroxy6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid) hydrolyase, which is a homodimer, has been postulated to undergo a ``twoconformation'' model (i.e., oscillating cycles of catalysis) (Horsman et al. 2006). The E1 thiamin-dependent component of pyruvate dehydrogenase has also been proposed to undergo ``flip-flop'' catalysis (Frank et al. 2004; Seifert et al. 2006). Why would an enzyme have oscillating cycles of catalysis? Insight into the answer can be gleaned from the process of translation. Nierhaus and colleagues have shown that the binding of tRNAs to the A and E sites in the ribosome displays negative cooperativity (Burkhardt et al. 1998). The binding of acylated tRNA to the A site induces the deacylated tRNA bound to the E site to have a lower affinity. In fact, the affinity of tRNAs for the A and E sites are proposed to alternate via a conformational change in the ribosome (Burkhardt et al. 1998). Thus, negative

cooperativity can impart directionality to a biological process. In the case of BC, the negative cooperativity would allow for tight binding of substrates to one subunit and while the other subunit has a low affinity for the products, thereby promoting their release. And just as in the ribosome, the two subunits alternate their conformational changes. The recent crystal structure of pyruvate carboxylase shows that the alternate conformational cycle permits the biotin substrate to shuttle between the BC and the transferase activities (St. Maurice et al. 2007). Similarly, such oscillating cycles within BC may enable the BCCP-mediated transfer of activated carboxylate moieties from the carboxylase active site to the CT active site. A more detailed understanding of this fascinating process will likely require a structure of the entire acetylCoA carboxylase multienzyme complex.

centrifugation (1 h at 100,000g at 4°C). The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 100 mL Ni-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen) previously equilibrated in the cell lysis buffer described above. The column was washed with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 1 mM TCEP, until the absorbance of the eluate at 280 nm was stable. BC was eluted in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, and 0.5 mM TCEP. The eluate was concentrated to at least 10 mg/mL and further purified by successive injections of no more than 80 mg of protein onto a 26/60 Superdex 300 gel filtration column (GE Lifesciences), previously equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP. The protein eluted at an apparent molecular weight consistent with a homodimer of EcBC subunits. The protein was concentrated to 10 mg/mL and stored frozen at À80°C.

Cloning, expression, and purification of P. aeruginosa biotin carboxylase
The accC gene was amplified from P. aeruginosa PAO1 genomic DNA by PCR and inserted into the pPW4 expression vector (Affinium Pharmaceuticals). The PaBC expression construct contains the following hexahistidine tag sequence at the C terminus of the protein: GSENLYFQGHHHHHH. PaBC was overexpressed in BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen) using modified terrific broth as described above for EcBC except that kanamycin (50 mg/L) was used for vector selection. Lysis and Ni-NTA purifcation of PaBC was performed as described above for EcBC with the following changes. Glycerol (10% v/v) was included in the Ni-NTA column purification and most of the protein eluted at 50 mM imidazole. The elution of PaBC at lower imidazole concentrations required an additional purification step using a 150 mL column of Q Sepharose (GE Lifesciences) equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP. PaBC was eluted from this column with a linear gradient of the above buffer into buffer with 250 mM KCl. Fractions containing PaBC were further purified by gel filtration chromatography as described above, except that the column buffer was 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP. The protein eluted at an apparent molecular weight consistent with a homodimer. The purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/mL and stored frozen at À80°C.

Conclusions 1. The crystal structure of the BC from S. aureus has revealed for the first time the relationship of how AMPPNP (an ATP analog) and the two requisite magnesium atoms bind at the active site. 2. The observation that the ATP analog AMPPNP can bind to E. coli BC in a nonproductive (in this case curled) conformation supports the hypothesis of substrateinduced synergism. 3. Characterization of E. coli BC in which one subunit of the homodimer has a nucleotide bound and is in the closed conformation, while the other subunit is unliganded and in the open conformation provides structural evidence that the two subunits could alternate their catalytic cycles.

This generated a clone with the following sequence N-terminal to the initiating methionine of ecAccC: MSYYHHHHHHLESTSLYKKAGFEGDRT. Protein expression was performed in BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen). Typical expression experiments were in six L batches using shaker flasks at 37°C in modified terrific broth (23.9 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl, 12 g/L casamino acids, 2.2 g/L monobasic potassium phosphate, 12.3 g/L dibasic potassium phosphate, 0.8% [v/v] glycerol) supplemented with 150 mg/L ampicillin. Cells were grown to late log phase and induced with 1 mM IPTG and 0.2% (v/v) arabinose for 5 h at 30°C.

Cloning, expression, and purification of S. aureus biotin carboxylase
The accC gene was cloned from S. aureus strain Mu50 by PCR from genomic DNA and inserted into the pPW2 expression vector (Affinium Pharmaceuticals). This generated a clone with the following sequence N-terminal to the initiating methionine of SaBC: MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH. SaBC was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) using modified terrific broth as described above for EcBC except that expression was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 250 mM and allowed to proceed for 18 h at 15°C. Lysis and Ni-NTA purification of SaBC were performed as described above for EcBC. The protein eluted at an apparent molecular weight consistent with a homodimer.

diffusion methods (Table 2). Crystallization drops consisted of equal parts of the protein and reservoir solutions. To obtain the EcBC/AMPPNP, EcBC/ADPCF2P, or PaBC/AMPCP crystals, the enzyme (10 mg/mL) was incubated with the nucleotide (5 mM) and MgCl2 (5 mM) at 4°C for at least 4 h prior to crystallization. The ATP analog ADPCF2P was provided by the Chemistry Division of Pfizer, Inc. No biotin or biotinylated BCCP was introduced in the EcBC/AMPPNP, EcBC/ADPCF2P, or PaBC/AMPCP complexes. To obtain the SaBC/AMPPNP crystals, the enzyme (5 mg/ mL) was incubated with the nucleotide (5 mM) and MgCl2 (5 mM) at 4°C for at least 4 h prior to crystallization. Multiple crystals appeared under different conditions, including 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 10%­12% PEG 3350, and 0.4 M NaCl. ° However, crystals diffracted poorly (resolution 5 A or worse) and often were not single (see Supplemental material). During the crystal optimization process, the biotinylated full-length SaBCCP was introduced in a 1:1 molar ratio to the SaBC/ AMPPNP/Mg2+ complex. While fewer crystallization conditions delivered crystal hits this time, a new condition generated ° several crystals that diffracted X-rays to 2.1 A for data collection (Table 2).

X-ray data collection, structure determination, and refinement
X-ray diffraction data from the crystals were collected in-house or at the Advanced Photon Source facility on beamline 17-ID operated by the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association (Table 2). The crystals were mounted in the cryoloops and treated with the cryo-protection solutions (Table 2). The crystals were moved from the crystallization drop to cryosolution for 3­5 sec before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Intensity data were measured at about À180°C. One X-ray data set was collected for each crystal. Auto-indexing and processing of the measured intensity data were carried out with the HKL2000 software package (Otwinoski and Minor 1997). The intensity data-collection statistics are summarized in Table 2. The crystal structures of EcBC were solved by molecular replacement using the structures of EcBC as the search model (Thoden et al. 2000a; PDB code 1dv2). The crystal structures of SaBC and PaBC were determined by molecular replacement using the homology models constructed using the coordinates of EcBC (Thoden et al. 2000a; PDB code 1dv2) and a set of aligned sequences. The rotation/translation searches were carried out with the MOLREP program (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 1994; Vagin and Teplyakov 1997). The molecular replacement solution was further optimized by rigid body, coordinates, and B-value minimization using CNX 2000 (Brunger ¨ et al. 1998). Calculated (2Fo­Fc) and (Fo­Fc) electron density maps were utilized for interactive fitting of protein structures into electron density using the COOT software program (Emsley and Cowtan 2004). Protein model building was alternating with coordinate minimization and individual B-factor refinement using REFMAC (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 1994; Murshudov et al. 1997). Placement of the ligands into electron density maps was carried out with X-LIGAND (Oldfield 2001) implemented in QUANTA (Accelrys, Inc.). Solvent water molecules were added periodically based on examination of difference density maps using the water picking tools in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan 2004) and X-SOLVATE. Final coordinates were validated using the PROCHECK validation tools (Laskowski et al. 1993). Summary of final refinement parameters and the final Rwork and Rfree values are listed in Table 2.
