Primary (AL) amyloidosis results from the pathologic deposition of monoclonal light chains as amyloid fibrils. Studies of recombinant-derived variable region (VL) fragments of these proteins have shown an inverse relationship between thermodynamic stability and fibrillogenic potential. Further, ionic interactions within the VL domain were predicted to influence the kinetics of light chain fibrillogenicity, as evidenced from our analyses of a relatively stable V6 protein (Jto) with a long range electrostatic interaction between Asp and Arg side chains at position 29 and 68, respectively, and an unstable, highly fibrillogenic V6 protein (Wil) that had neutral amino acids at these locations. To test this hypothesis, we have generated two Jtorelated mutants designed to disrupt the interaction between Asp 29 and Arg 68 (JtoD29A and JtoR68S). Although the thermodynamic stabilities of unfolding for these two molecules were identical, they exhibited very different kinetics of fibril formation: the rate of JtoD29A fibrillogenesis was slow and comparable to the parent molecule, whereas that of JtoR68S was significantly faster. High-resolution X-ray diffraction analyses of crystals prepared from the two mutants having the same space group and unit cell dimensions revealed no significant main-chain conformational changes. However, several notable side-chain alterations were observed in JtoR68S, as compared with JtoD29A, that resulted in the solvent exposure of a greater hydrophobic surface and modifications in the electrostatic potential surface. We posit that these differences contributed to the enhanced fibrillogenic potential of the Arg 68 mutant, since both Jto mutants lacked the intrachain ionic interaction and were equivalently unstable. The information gleaned from our studies has provided insight into structural parameters that in addition to overall thermodynamic stability, contribute to the fibril forming propensity of immunoglobulin light chains.

INTRODUCTION
The aggregation of normally soluble proteins into fibrils and their deposition in vital tissues and organs are characteristic of a broad spectrum of diseases known as the amyloidoses (Falk et al., 1997). There are more than 20 known amyloidogenic precursor proteins, e.g. -peptide (A), islet

amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), -synuclein, transthyretin (TTR) and immunoglobulin light chain proteins that are associated with Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, Parkinson's disease, familial polyneuropathy, and primary amyloidosis (AL), respectively (Sipe, 1994; Westermark et al., 2002). Irrespective of the precursor protein, amyloid fibrils exhibit universal structural properties: they are 8­ 10 nm diameter fibers composed of bundled protofilaments and are of indeterminate length (Serpell et al., 1999, 2000). The precursor proteins within the fibrillar array adopt a -pleated sheet conformation with the strands oriented approximately perpendicular to the long axis of the fibril (Sunde and Blake, 1997). The characteristic nucleationdependent kinetics of fibril formation in vitro and evidence for a critical protein concentration below which polymerization cannot occur liken fibrillogenesis to a crystallization process (Bishop and Ferrone, 1984; Harper and Lansbury, 1997; Serpell, 2000).

Primary (AL) amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition in vital organs and tissues of fibrillar aggregates composed predominantly of the variable region (VL) of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (LC). Clinically, patients with AL exhibit extreme morbidity which is usually fatal (Solomon and Weiss, 1995; Tan et al., 1995; Rajkumar et al., 1998; Bellotti et al., 2000; Merlini and Bellotti, 2003). Comparative analyses have differentiated amyloid- from non-amyloid-associated proteins on the basis of certain amino acid substitutions at particular sites within the VL (Raffen et al., 1999; Stevens, 2000). Further, studies of the thermodynamic consequences of amino acid substitutions within these molecules have demonstrated an inverse correlation between protein stability and the propensity for fibril formation (Hurle et al., 1994; Bellotti et al., 1996; Raffen et al., 1999; Wall et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000, 2003). This relationship is also observed in other amyloidogenic precursor proteins, e.g. TTR (Hammarstrom et al., 2002, 2003), prion protein (Safar et al., 1993; Thual et al., 2001) and lysozyme (Plaza del Pino et al., 2000; Takano et al., 2001). In addition, the primary amino acid sequence has been shown to be predictive of fibril forming propensity (Chiti et al., 2003). A thorough mutational analysis of human muscle acylphosphatase, a fibril-forming peptide not associated with amyloid disease, demonstrated a correlation between the fibrillogenic propensity of single amino acid mutants with three physical properties--hydrophobicity, charge and the propensity for -helix to -sheet transition (Chiti et al., 2003). The rate of fibril elongation was linearly dependent upon these physicochemical properties (Chiti et al., 1999, 2003). Thermodynamic destabilization and the concomitant increase in fibril-forming propensity have been attributed, in LC proteins, to mutations that disrupt critical intrachain ionic interactions or remove proline residues that anchor the -sheet network, as well as those that introduce glycosylation sites (Omtvedt et al., 2000; Stevens, 2000). As a result of destabilization the VL domain can adopt non-native structural conformations that may be pro-amyloidogenic, thus facilitating the formation of fibrils (Khurana et al., 2001, 2003a, b; Kim et al., 2003). The precise structural and physicochemical penalties for destabilizing the light chain VL domain that lead to enhanced fibrillogenicity remain enigmatic. However, decreases in the thermodynamic stability of amyloidogenic proteins can result in: dissociation of stable oligomeric complexes (McCutchen et al., 1993;

Jiang et al., 2001); increased hydrophobicity indicated by the enhanced fluorescence emission of the dye ANS (Souillac et al., 2002, 2003; Khurana et al., 2003b); compaction of the protein, evidenced by a decrease in the radius of gyration (Souillac et al., 2003); and, the dislocation of loops in the polypeptide chain from the body of the protein, thereby exposing novel interfaces that may support selfassociation (Davis et al., 2000). Monoclonal light chains of the V6 subgroup are, with one notable exception, invariably associated with primary (AL) amyloidosis. We have shown that a comparison of two V6 proteins, Jto and Wil, the former derived from a patient with multiple myeloma who had no clinical manifestation of amyloidosis and the latter obtained from an amyloidotic individual, revealed differences in the thermodynamic stability of unfolding that correlated with the rates of fibril formation in vitro (Wall et al., 1999). Based on X-ray diffraction data on crystals prepared from these two molecules, we posited that the increased stability of protein Jto resulted from a unique ionic surface interaction between residues Asp29 and Arg68 that was not present in the unstable fibrillogenic protein Wil due to the presence of uncharged amino acids at these two positions (Pokkuluri et al., 1999). To test this hypothesis, we have generated two mutant Jto variants, designated JtoD29A and JtoR68S, in which the residues at position 29 and 68 were replaced by their germline-encoded counterparts, Ala and Ser, respectively (Fig. 1). We now report the results of our comparative studies of the thermodynamic stability, kinetics of fibrillogenesis, and tertiary structural features of these two mutants with those of native Jto and the amyloidogenic protein Wil. These analyses have demonstrated that in addition to the overall thermodynamic stability of the VL domain, hydrophobic and electrostatic perturbations arising from the mutations can influence light chain amyloid formation.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Protein expression and purification The cDNA encoding the V6 Jto protein was prepared from an enriched population of monoclonal plasma cells isolated from the bone marrow of patient Jto and sub-cloned into a pET-27( þ ) vector for protein expression in E. coli.

of the V6 Jto proteins have been previously described (Wall et al., 1999). The JtoD29A and JtoR68S mutations were constructed using Stratagene Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit. Oligonucleotides containing the appropriate base changes, D29A and R68S, were used to amplify by PCR the V6Jto/pET-27 plasmid. The template product was digested with the Dpn1 nuclease and the daughter plasmids transformed into DH5 E. coli. The mutant V6 proteins JtoD29A and JtoR68S were re-transformed for protein production in E. coli (Wall et al., 1999). Thermodynamic and fibrillogenesis analyses The folding stabilities of the purified JtoD29A and JtoR68S proteins were determined by incubation in solutions of increasing molar concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdHCl), as previously described. The values of Cm and ÁGH2O, represent, respectively, the concentration of GdHCl required to achieve 50% unfolding in a two-state transition and the free energy of stabilization extrapolated to pure water. Fibrillogenesis kinetics were monitored at 37  C using a solution containing 3 mM protein, 10 mM thioflavin T, 150 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. An increase in the fluorescence intensity of the thioflavin T measured at 490 nm (excitation, 450 nm) was indicative of fibril formation (Naiki et al., 1989; Wall et al., 1999). Aggregates formed in the reactions were confirmed as fibrils by negative-stain electron microscopic analyses, as previously described (Wall et al., 1999). Crystallization conditions Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature. JtoD29A was crystallized in a mother liquor of 0.8 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and containing 0.1 M cadmium chloride. A 10 mg/ml solution of JtoD29A protein was equilibrated with the mother liquor at a ratio of 1:1. The crystals were improved by additions of the detergent n-decyl-B-D-maltoside added to the hanging drop at its CMC. JtoR68S was crystallized under similar conditions except higher concentrations of cadmium chloride (40 mM) and protein (14 mg/ml) were used in the mother liquor. Data collection and reduction JtoD29A and JtoR68S crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in their respective mother liquors containing 10­15% glycerol. Diffraction data for JtoR68S and JtoD29A were collected at a temperature of À160  C and a wavelength of ° 1.5418 A on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode X-ray generator with osmic focusing mirrors using a R-axis IVþþ ° image plate detector to 1.9 and 2.5 A, respectively. Highresolution data on JtoD29A crystals were collected at ° À160  C and a wavelength of 0.97622 A using a Mar image plate detector at the synchrotron instrument in Hamburg on a DESY 9 source at the BW7A beamline. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Minor et al., 2000). The SCALEPACK

data were converted to the mtz format using the CCP4 program SCALEPACK2MTZ, and the structure factors were calculated using the program TRUNCATE that implements French and Wilson statistics (French and Wilson, 1978). In order to determine the space group, pseudo precession pictures using the CCP4 script HKLVIEW were created. Structure determination The JtoD29A and JtoR68S structures were solved using the molecular replacement method (Brick and Blow, 1987), with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) implemented in the crystallographic suite CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project 1994). In AMoRe, ROTING calculates the rotation function, TRAING calculates the translation function, and FITTING performs a rigid-body refinement of the structure. The starting model used for JtoD29A and JtoR68S was the V6 Jto dimer (PDB no. 1CD0), which crystallized in ° ° the space group P212121, with a ¼ 68.018 A, b ¼ 58.388 A, ° c ¼ 59.037 A,  ¼  ¼  ¼ 90 . Data in the resolution range ° of 50­3.0 A were used for conducting molecular replace° ment and the radius of integration was 0.0­23.738 A. PDB accession codes were 1PEW for JtoD29A and 1PW3 for JtoR68S. For JtoR68S, the correlation coefficients from the translation function were 25.0 and 24.7%, respectively, for the two molecules/asymmetric unit. The largest noise peak had a correlation coefficient of 13%. After fixing molecule one to find the relative position of the second molecule using TRAING, the correlation coefficient increased to 40.4%. Final fitting using the program FITTING further increased the correlation coefficient to 67.2%. For JtoD29A, the correlation coefficients from the translation function were 23.1 and 20.2%, respectively, for the two molecules/asymmetric unit. After fixing molecule 1 to find the relative position of the second molecule, the correlation coefficient increased to 39.4%. Final fitting improved the correlation coefficient to 65.6%. To fine tune the three orientation and three translational parameters the original solutions from MR were subjected ¨ to rigid-body refinement with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). This was followed by a round of simulated annealing and positional refinement, using the amplitude-based maximum likelihood target (MLF) in CNS. After glycine was substituted at the position of the mutations, 2Fo­Fc difference Fourier maps were calculated and displayed using the graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991). At this stage the replacements of Ser68 in JtoR68S and Ala29 in JtoD29A were conducted with the graphics program O. After several alternating rounds of positional refinement and model building with CNS and O, the refinement procedure was continued using the maximum likelihood method-based REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1996) in the CCP4 suite. Finally, both structures were subjected to B-factor refinement using REFMAC. Both proteins crystallized in the space group P4122 (Table 1). The final model of JtoD29A was refined to a crystallographic R value (Rcryst) of 25.2% and an Rfree value ° of 27% (Rfree was calculated with 5% of the data) at 2.0 A resolution. The rms deviations from ideality in bond angles ° and bond lengths were 1.219 and 0.017 A, respectively. For

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Thermodynamic stability The unfolding curves of the four V6 proteins Jto, JtoD298, JtoR68S and Wil, as determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdHCl, revealed midpoints (Cms) of 1.22 M (ÁGH2 O, 4.3 kcal/mol), 1 M (ÁGH2 O, 3.2 kcal/mol), 1 M (ÁGH2 O, 3.2 kcal/mol), and 0.83 M (ÁGH2 O, 2.2 kcal/ mol), respectively [Fig. 1(A)]. The 1.1 kcal/mol decrease in ÁGH2 O for the two Jto mutants represented $ 25% of the total net folding stability. In Jto mutants the degree of destabilization was approximately the same when either Asp29 or Arg68 was replaced by the uncharged germline residue. The lag times and rates of fibril formation of protein Jto and Wil correlated with their thermodynamic stabilities (Wall et al., 1999). Owing to their decreased stability, it was anticipated that both JtoD29A and JtoR68S single mutant variants would exhibit properties intermediate to those in the native and Jto and Wil proteins, for example they should exhibit equivalently shorter lag times in fibrillogenesis kinetics with respect to native Jto. Experimentally, the JtoR68S protein showed a lag time 5-fold faster ($ 7000 s) than that of Jto, but this was still slower than that of protein Wil, a result consistent with its intermediate folding stability. Surprisingly, the JtoD29A variant had a lag time equivalent to that of the native Jto molecule [Fig. 2(B)]. The formation of fibrils by both Jto variants was confirmed by electron microscopy [Fig. 2(C, D)]. Within experimental

error the JtoD29A and JtoR68S mutants had almost superimposable chaotropic denaturation curves; however, the latter molecule exhibited a 5-fold shorter lag time in the kinetics of fibril formation. Thus, the kinetics of fibril formation of the two V6 variants could not be explained simply in terms of their ÁG values of unfolding. We therefore examined the three-dimensional structures of Jto, Wil and the Jto mutants for additional insight into this anomalous observation. X-ray analyses of JtoD29A and JtoR68S After glycine was substituted at the site of the two mutations, the 2Fo­Fc omit maps derived after several rounds of first rigid-body refinement and positional refinement unambiguously defined the electron density of the mutated residues in both JtoD29A and JtoR68S [Fig. 3(A) and (B)]. Both JtoD29A and JtoR68S were crystallized in the presence of cadmium chloride. Four bound Cd2þ ions per asymmetric unit were identified in each protein; and 107 and 115 water molecules were included in the final refinements of JtoD29A and JtoR68S, respectively. In the former, residues 39­42 were disordered. To determine whether significant main-chain conformational changes accompanied the substitutions of residues at position 29 and 68, the structures of JtoD29A and JtoR68S were superimposed with those of the stable (native) Jto and unstable Wil V6 proteins [Fig. 3(C)]. All four molecules were virtually identical except for regions within the immediate vicinity of the Asp29Ala and Arg68Ser mutations. The C main-chain rms differences between Jto and the JtoD29A, JtoR68S and Wil proteins were 1.368, 0.669, and ° 0.865 A, respectively. Given the >90% sequence identity among these V6 molecules (Fig. 1), the C rms values reflected the high degree of primary structural homology. Although the main-chain conformations were almost identical, several notable side-chain conformational differences were found at the site of the mutations. Loss of Arg68 facilitated the formation of a new hydrogen bond between the carboxyl oxygen of Asp29 and the ND1 atom of Asn31 [Fig. 3(D)]. The hydroxyl group of the substituted Ser68 in the same mutant was solvent exposed and not involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with other parts of the protein. In JtoD29A, substitution of Asp29 allowed the guanidinium group of Arg68 to turn toward the solvent [Fig. 3(D)]. In contrast to the JtoR68S variant, the sidechain conformation of Asn31 in the JtoD29A mutant was identical to that of the native Jto structure. Because JtoD29A and JtoR68S crystallized in the same space group with nearly identical unit cell dimensions, it was possible to perform detailed comparisons of the hydrophobic surface accessible and electrostatic potential surface areas. Hydrophobic effects ° There was a 42.5 A2 increase in solvent accessibility of hydrophobic residues (Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Met and Phe) in JtoR68S as compared with JtoD29A, indicating that loss of Arg69 propagated the exposure of a larger hydrophobic

surface area with respect to the D29A substitution. We also investigated whether there were differences in the solvent exposure of apolar atoms in all side-chains in the two V6 Jto variants. Residues at 14 positions were shown to have higher apolar surface accessibilities in JtoR68S as compared to JtoD29A (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the affected residues were not randomly positioned around the domain; rather they were clustered into two regions: one located between residues 5 and 32 and the second between positions 61­79 (Fig. 4). These observations were consistent with findings from a difference distance matrix plot analysis of JtoR68S vs JtoD29A (data not shown). The first cluster, which lay within the first -hairpin loop, contained a majority of the exposed apolar atoms. The second consisted of a strand adjacent to the relatively apolar N-terminal -hairpin loop (Fig. 4). The strand between residues 70 and 80 of the V4 protein Len is complementary to the binding site of the light chain chaperone protein BiP (Davis et al., 2000; Dul et al., 2001). It is possible that this region becomes displaced, revealing novel interfaces that may be involved in fibril formation. Indeed, a synthetic peptide mimicking residues 74­80 of the 4 protein Len inhibited the fibrillogenesis of the Len VL protein in vitro, indicating the importance of this region in self-association during fibril-formation (Davis et al., 2000). Electrostatic effects We compared the electrostatic potential surfaces of the two V6 Jto mutants using the program Delphi. The native Jto had a net charge of À2, as compared to values of À1 and À3 in JtoD29A and JtoR68S, respectively. The effects of the mutations and the accompanying changes in net charge were readily apparent on the electrostatic potential surface maps (Fig. 5). The electrostatic potential surface of JtoR68S appeared to exhibit a well-defined dipole, as compared with Jto and JtoD29A (Fig. 5). JtoD29A exhibited a localized increase in positive electrostatic potential away from the site of the mutation. We attributed this increase to the movement of the guanidinium side-chain of Arg54, indicating that the loss of Asp29 has had long-range effects on protein structure and perhaps function (Fig. 5). Although exhibiting equivalent folding stabilities, the less fibrillogenic JtoD29S variant was characterized by a more hydrophilic surface area surface area and a difference of þ2 in the net charge with respect to the fibrillogenic JtoR68S mutant. Chiti et al. have shown that mutations that increase the hydrophobicity or increase the net negative charge of proteins or peptides render them more fibrillogenic (Chiti et al., 2003). This correlation was determined by measuring the formation of fibrils from unstructured peptides and unfolded proteins, not from the native state ensemble. Our data do not conform to this analysis because the fibrillogenesis of Jto mutants was measured under conditions where the native state ensemble was highly populated. The contention presented here is that the mutation in JtoR68S led to decreased stability and physicochemical modifications that favor fibrillogenesis. In JtoD29A thermodynamic stability was also decreased, but the substitution did not affect the resistance to form fibrils. Mutations in TTR have been found to enhance fibrillogenicity, not by decreasing the equilibrium thermodynamic stability

but by increasing the dissociation rate of the stable tetramer--a prerequisite for fibril formation (Jiang et al., 2001). Our studies of the thermodynamic properties, fibrillogenic potential, and tertiary structure of four homologous V6 molecules have provided evidence that factors other than thermodynamic stability influence the amyloidogenic propensities of immunoglobulin light chain VL domains.

The data contradicted the expected correlation between increased fibrillogenic propensity and decreasing folding stability in an unexpected, yet not unique fashion. Previously, we had shown that the destabilization of a nonamyloidogenic 1 LC (GAL), to a level equivalent to that of the amyloidogenic BIF 1 domain, led to formation of soluble aggregates, but not to discrete fibrils (Kim et al.,

2000). The finding that the kinetics of fibril formation by mutant Jto proteins (particularly JtoD29A) could not be attributed solely to folding stability suggested that other factors were involved. A similar discordance has been noted between the stability of certain human cellular prion protein mutants and the observed disease phenotype (Liemann and Glockshuber, 1999).

Comparative analysis of the tertiary structural features of the four 6 VL domains of varying fibrillogenic potential indicated subtle physicochemical differences between Jto and its mutants. These differences were manifest in the area of exposed hydrophobic surface area and in negative electrostatic potential surface area. Further analysis of the impact of each mutation on the thermodynamic stability and fibrillogenic propensity has provided a model to rationalize the data. Taken as a pair, the combined contribution of Asp29 and Arg68 to the overall stability of the VL domain in Jto was calculated to be approximately 2 kcal/mol compared with the stability of Wil, with neutral germline-like residues at these positions (ÁGJto À ÁGWil ¼ 2.1 kcal/mol). When calculated separately, the difference in stability (ÁGJto À ÁGJtomutant) was found to be 1.1 kcal/mol for each of the substitutions of Asp29 for Ala or Arg68 for Ser. Thus, the two replacements were energetically similar. Together, they equaled the double mutant in contributing to the stability of the Jto VL domain. Further calculations suggested that the coupling free energy of the Asp29:Arg68 long-range electrostatic interaction was negligible and relatively unimportant (Bosshard et al., 2004). Therefore, the increased domain stability associated with the Asp29 and Arg68 substitutions may be attributed to the increased

hydrophilicity of these residues with respect to their germline encoded counterparts--Ala and Ser, respectively. The relative hydrophilicity values are 3.0 for aspartic acid, 3.0 for arginine, but only À0.5 for alanine and 0.3 for serine (Hopp, 1989). Considering the appearances of Asp29 and Arg68 independently, we next assessed the impact of each mutation on the fibrillogenic potential of the highly amyloidogenic 6 polypeptide sequence. Clinical observations previously demonstrated recurring correlations between products of the 6 germline gene and amyloid disease (Ozaki et al., 1994). The Asp29:Ser68 pairing in JtoR68S yielded a highly fibrillogenic variant with reaction kinetics similar to those of protein Wil. The Ala29:Arg68 variant (JtoD29A), however, exhibited significantly slower fibril formation, equivalent to that of protein Jto. Thus, the presence of Arg68 alone was sufficient to slow the rate of fibril formation. It is interesting that Arg68 immediately precedes the two-

residue insertion (68a and b in framework 3) that is unique to the 6 subgroup. This region has been targeted as a probable participant in the formation of fibrils. A bulky, fully charged and highly solvated Arg side chain in this region may sterically, electrostatically or entropically interfere with what is an otherwise highly efficient polymerization process.
