We have determined a 2.9 angstrom resolution structure of CorA from Thermotoga maritima that reveals a pentameric cone­ shaped protein. Two potential regulatory metal binding sites are found in the N-terminal domain that bind both Mg2þ and Co2þ. The structure of CorA supports an efflux system involving dehydration and rehydration of divalent metal ions potentially mediated by a ring of conserved aspartate residues at the cytoplasmic entrance and a carbonyl funnel at the periplasmic side of the pore. ivalent metal cations are essential cofactors in many proteins. To provide cells with appropriate concentrations of divalent metal cations, highly regulated transporters and channels have evolved to translocate these ions across the hydrophobic membranes. CorA is one of the best studied families of divalent cation transporters (1­9). It is considered to be the primary Mg2þ transporter of both Bacteria and Archaea and is ubiquitously distributed (8). Sequence homologies between members of this family are most pronounced at the C termini; sequence conservation in the N termini is less significant (fig. S1). The overall sequence similarity between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is weak, except for the highly conserved Gly-Met-Asn (GMN) motif close to the C termini (10, 11). Never-

theless, some eukaryotic CorA family members show overlapping activities with the prokaryotic members that suggests functional, as well as structural, conservation (4, 10, 12, 13). Studies of CorA from Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and the Archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii demonstrate that ions can be transported in both directions (1­3, 5, 8, 9). Kehres and Maguire recently reported two classes of CorAs among Bacteria and Archaea (8). The second class, CorA-II, which differs from the extensively studied S. typhimurium and E. coli CorAs, was suggested to contain two transmembrane helices, with both termini in the cytosol. In the same report, the CorA-II proteins were suggested to be efflux systems. Moreover, a novel CorA-related protein, ZntB, was recently identified in S. typhimurium (14). ZntB was shown to be a Zn2þ efflux system with two predicted transmembrane helices and both termini facing the cytosol (15). This is in contrast with the predicted topology of S. typhimurium and E. coli CorA, with three transmembrane helices and the N terminus facing the periplasm.

Crystal Structure of a Divalent Metal Ion Transporter CorA at 2.9 Angstrom Resolution

reported structure of a pentameric full-length CorA at 3.9 ) was used for molecular replacement, revealing two pentamers in the asymmetric unit (16). The structure has been refined to an R of 27.6% and an Rfree of 29.5% with good stereochemistry (table S1). The CorA structure reveals a pentamer with the shape of a cone (Fig. 1). The tip of the cone is formed by two transmembrane (TM) helical segments from each monomer and the large opening of the cone by the N-terminal region of CorA. The fold of the CorA monomer is composed of an N-terminal a/b domain with a central seven-stranded mixed b sheet lined by three small helices. Two long a helices cover one face of the a/b domain and form a bundle together with a giant a helix 7 constituted by È70 residues. The C-terminal end of helix 7 constitutes the first transmembrane segments (residues 291 to 312). Following the large helix 7 is helix 8 (residues 327 to 349), which forms the second TM helix and packs in a ring around the TM segment of helix 7 (Fig. 1). Thermotoga maritima CorA is most closely related to the class II CorA with both N- and C-terminal ends facing the cytosol and, therefore, is likely to be primarily involved in ion efflux. The localization of the N termini in the cytoplasm is also supported by the positiveinside rule (17) and the Nin-Cin topology of Bhelical hairpin[ structures (18). Sequence alignment of close homologs of T. maritima CorA and those of S. typhimurium CorA support the proposal for two distinct classes of CorA (fig. S1). Our structure agrees in all general features with the structure determined by Lunin et al. (16) that was used for phasing. However, because of the higher resolution of 2.9 ), our structure provides more details of functionally important regions, including potential regulatory metal binding sites beyond the metal in site 1 (M1) identified in the 3.9 ) structure. Two putative metal-binding sites are found at each interface between the N-terminal domains in the pentamer (Fig. 2). An anomalous difference map of Co2þ-soaked crystals shows that Co2þ

REPORTS
can populate these sites, but in the native crystal they are most likely occupied by Mg2þ ions, because 100 mM of MgCl2 was present during crystallization (19). Residues from two interacting N-terminal domains contribute a cluster of carboxylates to the interface region where the metal binds. M1 is closely coordinated by the side chains of two carboxylate residues, Asp89 and Asp253. Because Mg2þ is most often hexacoordinated in biological systems (20­22), the M1 site is likely coordinated by three or four additional water molecules. Although these waters are not unambiguously defined at the present resolution, the environment of the sites is constituted by an appropriate network of hydrogen-bonding residues, which can provide a second coordination sphere for these water molecules (residues Asn92, Gln95, Glu100, Asp256, and His257). The second metal site, M2, is found some 7 ) from M1, in a cavity surrounded by the main chain of Leu12 and side chains of Glu88, Asp175, and Asp253. The distances from the bound cobalt to the surrounding potential protein ligands are greater than 3.5 ), which is too long for direct coordination. It is possible that the metal ion binds in a fully hydrated form and that water molecules mediate the metal coordination. The highly negative charge of the ligand sphere, including three carboxylates, implies that the site is well designed to accommodate highly charged cations. In the region close to the metal-binding sites, a putative Cl­ ion is coordinated to the side chains of Arg153 and Tyr168, and the main chain of Ile160. Both the metal at the M2 site and this chloride ion appear to be important in stabilizing the confirmation of the N-terminal residues 6 to 13. A sequence alignment of prokaryotic CorAs reveals that the carboxylate residues coordinating M1 and M2, as well as Arg153 coordinating ­ the Cl ion, are conserved in all class II CorAs and to some extent in class I CorAs (with the exception of M. jannaschii, in which it seems to define a separate class), and these binding sites are therefore likely to be functionally important (fig. S1). A symmetric five-fold ring of the Nterminal half of helix 7 from the five subunits, including the TM segment, forms the putative ion-transporting pore. The pore is narrowest at three rings formed by Met291, Leu294, and Met302, respectively. At the cytosolic side, the pore diameter rapidly increases around Asp277, which eventually leads to the funnel-shaped cavity formed by the N-terminal domain. At the periplasmic site, the pore remains narrow until Tyr311. No density is detected in the pore region

for bound water or metal ions. However, a significant residual density (È4.5s in the Fobs ­ Fcalc maps) is found at the ring formed by the side chains of five symmetry-related Asp277 residues (Fig. 3) in one of the pentamers in the asymmetric unit. This density is asymmetrically located close to two of the five aspartates and is likely due to the binding of one or two metal ions, most probably Mg2þ. Interestingly, Asp277 is highly conserved among class II CorAs (fig. S1). No similar density was reported in the 3.9 ) structure (16). The conserved GMN sequence (residues 312 to 314) occurs just after the first TM segment on the periplasmic side. In one of the pentamers in the asymmetric unit, only residual density is present for the region Gly312 to Gly326, and the entrance of the pore is well exposed. In the other pentamer in the asymmetric unit, significant density is present for most of these loops, although an unambiguous placement of the side chains cannot be made. It appears, however, that this density covers the pore entrance, and therefore, the two pentamers represent two different forms, determined by the loop structure that can toggle between an open and a more closed form. In the best-defined loops, the main-chain carbonyls of the Tyr-GlyMet-Asn (YGMN) section are exposed into the central section of the periplasmic entrance of the pore. Furthermore, in the refined model, distortions are present in the last two turns of the TM segment of helix 7, resulting in the carbonyls of Gly309 also being exposed to the pore. These, together with the carbonyls of the conserved YGMN, make a polar strip well suited for interacting with cations (Fig. 4). The distortions of the TM segment persisted, although repeatedly regulated to standard helical positions during the refinement, and are well represented in the electron density. The cause of these distortions is Pro303, which breaks the regular hydrogen-bonding pattern in the middle of the helix. Note that Pro303 packs closely on to the side chain of Phe300 (fig. S2). These are the two residues most conserved in the pore region (fig. S1). However, whether this plays a structural and/or mechanistic role (e.g., as a hinge) is not clear from the present structure. The structure of CorA reveals a TM pore that is different from pores seen in other cation channels (or transporters). The pore has several narrow regions and lacks appropriate polar groups for interacting with cations along more than two-thirds of its 60 ) length. The only polar groups exposed in the interior of the channel are Ser284, Thr287, and Thr305. However, these hydroxyl-containing side chains are not particularly well suited for cation interactions. In other gated cation channels, conformational realignment of the TM segments have led to an opening of a narrow region of the channel (23, 24). However, in all of these cases, this narrow region is only constituted by a smaller part of the pore, whereas most of the pore has an extensive cavity or selectivity filter preformed before the opening event. In contrast, in CorA, extensive, largely hydrophobic interactions are made in the interior parts of the pore. This implies that gating, as well as transport, might work differently than in previously studied cation-transport systems. The high conservation of Asp277 in the bacterial CorAII homologs, together with the localization of strong residual density at the Asp277 carboxylate ring at the entrance of the pore, implies that this residue is important for transport or regulation in CorAs. In the TolC transport system, an Baspartate ring[ formed by the carboxylates of three aspartate residues was shown to determine selectivity, as well as to form a binding site for inhibitory cations (25, 26). It is possible that the Baspartate ring[ of CorA plays a similar role. In addition, the aspartate ring in CorA might directly catalyze the essential events required for moving a divalent cation reversibly between the solvent and the low dielectric environment of the pore. These events could encompass dehydration through ligand-exchange reactions, but also, protonation or deprotonation events mediated by the clustered carboxylate residues to obtain an ion of appropriate charge. The binding of two metals at sites M1 and M2 suggests that CorA transport is gated through regulation of these sites. Co2þ binds to these sites at a concentration one-fifth that of Mg2þ, which suggests that cobalt might be a physiological relevant regulator and, therefore, also a transport substrate for T. maritima CorA. The primary effect of the binding of metals to the M1 and M2 sites appears to be in modulating the interactions between neighboring N-terminal domains. A metal-free protein is likely to have significantly reduced N-terminal domain interactions, because of the energetically unfavorable clustering of carboxylates when the metals are removed. The presence of two metal binding sites is intriguing and suggests that the regulatory mechanism might be more complex than in other gated channels, which are

normally regulated by two-state, on-off controls. The different coordination environments of the two ions, one directly coordinated to two carboxylates and the other likely coordinated as a hydrated ion, imply different binding kinetics and potentially allow a more refined mode of regulation. Alternatively, the presence of two metal binding sites could be a tool to allow more than one type of cation to regulate CorA. A broad substrate spectrum for divalent cation transporters is not unusual (8, 27). In the absence of a structure of the metal-free protein, the mechanism for the regulatory control has to remain speculative. However, it appears feasible that the realignment of the N-terminal domains due to metal release at the M1 and M2 sites could have direct effects on the orientation of helix 7. This could potentially affect conformations in the region of Asp277 ring, which would thereby regulate its function in the transport event, or potentially, its suitability as a binding site for inhibitory cations, in analogy with TolC. A different gating mechanism would be the opening of the hydrophobic girdle, as proposed for the acetylcholine receptor through a ligand-induced helical rotation (28). Because of the more extended hydrophobic interactions in CorA, we consider this to be less likely, but still a possibility. The structure of CorA at 2.9 ) now provides a framework for addressing questions related to regulatory metal sites, conformational changes in regulation and transport events, and the detailed mechanism for the control of hydration levels of the transported ions.

Structure of the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Nucleoprotein-RNA Complex
Todd J. Green, Xin Zhang, Gail W. Wertz,* Ming Luo Vesicular stomatitis virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus. Its nucleoprotein (N) binds the viral genomic RNA and is involved in multiple functions including transcription, replication, and assembly. We have determined a 2.9 angstrom structure of a complex containing 10 molecules of the N protein and 90 bases of RNA. The RNA is tightly sequestered in a cavity at the interface between two lobes of the N protein. This serves to protect the RNA in the absence of polynucleotide synthesis. For the RNA to be accessed, some conformational change in the N protein should be necessary. he viral genomic RNA (vRNA) of negative-stranded RNA viruses (NSRVs), such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), do not exist as naked RNAs but rather as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex in which the RNA is encapsidated with the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The RNP, rather than the naked vRNA, is the active template for transcription and replication (1, 2). NSRVs include some of the most dangerous human pathogens, such as Ebola, rabies, avian influenza, and measles viruses.

VSV is an enveloped, nonsegmented NSRV that belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae. The 11,161-nucleotide (nt) genome of VSV comprises five genes, which are the nucleocapsid (N), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix (M), the glycoprotein (G), and the large subunit of the polymerase (L) (3). The entire RNP of VSV contains an estimated 1258 molecules of the N protein, each of which is bound to nine bases of RNA (4). Chemical probing studies have indicated that the N protein primarily binds to the ribose-phosphate backbone of the RNA (5). The large polymerase subunit (L) and the phosphoprotein (P) are the two essential viral components in the polymerase (1, 6). Viral transcription and replication by VSV are distinct processes that are defined in part by the level of the N protein in the cell. The N protein is initially in complex with the P protein, which SCIENCE VOL 313

prevents the concentration-dependent aggregation of N. This keeps the N protein in an encapsidation-competent form (7). In addition to protection of the vRNA, the N protein complexed to RNA as the RNP has the structural role of forming the helical core of the assembled virion. The RNP in association with the matrix (M) protein condenses the vRNA into a compact bundle that is ready for packaging into the mature virus. Before being packaged into the progeny virion, the RNP exists in several states in the cell, including an undulating ribbon, a loosely coiled helix, and a tightly coiled helix that is usually found at the termini of the nucleocapsids (4, 8­10). The transition from the states observed in the cell to the helix observed in the intact virion is not well understood. The inherent flexibility of the RNP has made it difficult to determine high-resolution structures by electron microscopy (EM) or x-ray crystallography. Recently, however, low-resolution EM reconstructions of ringlike structures composed of oligomeric N proteins in complex with RNA have been reported for rabies virus (11), influenza virus (12), and VSV (13). These structures showed that distinct N protein molecules are assembled on a single-strand RNA as parallel blocks. The RNA is bound in the center of the N protein ring. We have previously reported the production of oligomers of a VSV N/P protein complex bound to RNA from an Escherichia coli
