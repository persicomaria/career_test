Conformationally constrained 2-pyridone analogue 2 is a potent Met kinase inhibitor with an IC50 value of 1.8 nM. Further SAR of the 2-pyridone based inhibitors of Met kinase led to potent 4-pyridone and pyridine N-oxide inhibitors such as 3 and 4. The X-ray crystallographic data of the inhibitor 2 bound to the ATP binding site of Met kinase protein provided insight into the binding modes of these inhibitors, and the SAR of this series of analogues was rationalized. Many of these analogues showed potent antiproliferative activities against the Met dependent GTL-16 gastric carcinoma cell line. Compound 2 also inhibited Flt-3 and VEGFR-2 kinases with IC50 values of 4 and 27 nM, respectively. It possesses a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in mice and demonstrates significant in vivo antitumor activity in the GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma xenograft model.
Introduction The Met receptor tyrosine kinase is a transmembrane growth factor receptor that plays a critical role in both normal development and tumorigenesis.1 The disulfide-linked heterodimeric Met protein consists of an R- and -subunit with the receptor tyrosine kinase domain residing in the -chain. Met is expressed predominantly on epithelial and endothelial cells. It mediates a variety of epithelial functions, and deregulation of the HGF/Met pathway has been implicated in a wide variety of malignancies.2 Upon binding to its ligand, hepatcyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF), Met autophosphorylates tyrosines 1234 and 1235 within the activation loop (A-loop). Subsequently, phosphorylation of Y1349 and Y1356 in the multifunctional docking site at the C terminus occurs, which mediates the docking of multiple downstream signal transducers such as PI3K, SRC, and SHC.1,3,4 The biological consequences of HGF/Met signal transduction include tumor growth, induction of cell motility, invasiveness, metastases, and angiogenesis.1 Overexpression of Met or HGF and/or amplification of the Met gene is frequently observed in a variety of human tumors including liver, breast, pancreas, lung, kidney, bladder, ovary, brain, prostate, and myeloma, among others.5,6 The HGF/Met signaling pathway has been a popular target for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of human cancer. The growing list of experimental reagents with therapeutic potential that target the HGF/Met signaling pathway includes small molecules as well as various biologicals that include neutralizing antibodies against human HGF/SF and Met.7,8 The pyrrolopyridine derivative 1, containing an acylurea moiety, was previously reported to have potent Met kinase

inhibitory activity (Figure 1).9 Replacement of the acylurea moiety by a conformationally constrained 2-pyridone as in analogue 2 was envisioned as a new Met kinase inhibitor chemotype (Figure 2). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on the 2-pyridone analogues led to the identification of 4-pyridone 3 and pyridine N-oxide 4 (Figure 2). The synthesis, SAR, structural biology, and in vivo biological activities of these compounds are described. Chemistry Aminophenoxypyrrolopyridine 8 was prepared by coupling 4-chloropyrrolopyridine 510 with 2-fluoro-4-nitrophenol 6, followed by reduction of the nitro group of intermediate 7 using zinc metal (Scheme 1). Michael addition of 4-fluoroaniline 10 to pyrone ester 9 followed by intramolecular cyclization of the Michael adduct provided p-fluorophenyl-2-pyridone ester 11, which was hydrolyzed to afford p-fluorophenyl-2-pyridone acid 12. Coupling of amine 8 with 2-pyridone acid 12 produced pyrrolopyridine-2-pyridone analogue 2. 2-Pyridone analogues 13-20 (Table 1) were synthesized using similar procedures illustrated in Scheme 1. The syntheses of various 4-pyridone substituted analogues are depicted in Schemes 2-4. Fluorophenyl- -keoester 24, which was prepared from Meldrum's acid adduct 23 according to the literature procedure,11 was reacted with triazine 25 to obtain ester 26.12 Ester 26 was hydrolyzed to yield 3-fluorophe-

nylpyridine-4-pyridone acid 27. Coupling of acid 27 with pyrrolopyridine amine 8 provided 4-pyridone analogue 3 (Scheme 2). N-Methyl or N-hydroxyethyl substituted 4-pyridone analogues 34 and 37 were obtained from intermediate 3-bromo4-hydroxypyrine-5-carboxylic acid 29, which was obtained from 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxypyridine 2813 via metalation and carboxylation (Scheme 3). Alkylation of acid 29 with methyl iodide or the methyl ester of 29 with 2-hydroxybromoethane yielded N-substituted 4-pyridone esters 30 and 35, respectively. Miyaura-Suzuki coupling reaction14 of the bromo-4-pyridone esters 30 and 35 with p-fluorophenylboronic acid, followed by hydrolysis to the corresponding acids, and coupling of the acids 33 and 36 with pyrrolopyridine amine 8 afforded N-substituted 4-pyridone analogues 34 and 37, respectively. Alternatively, N-substituted 4-pyridone analogues 41-43 were prepared directly from 4-oxopyran 40 using the corresponding amine or aniline (Scheme 4). Pyrone aldehyde 38,15 which was obtained by Vilsmeier-Haack reaction of 4-fluorophenylacetone, was oxidized and converted to the acyl chloride 39. Coupling between acyl chloride 39 and pyrrolopyridine amine 8 afforded 4-pyrone 40. Reaction of pyrone 40 with various amines provided N-substituted 4-pyridone analogues 41-43. The synthesis of pyridine and pyridine N-oxide analogues 47 and 4 are described in Scheme 5. Phenylpicolinic acid 45 and 6-phenylpicoloinic acid N-oxide 46 were obtained by Miyaura-Suzuki coupling of 2-bromopicolinic acid 44 with

phenylboronic acid followed by oxidation. Coupling of 6-phenylpicoloinic acid 45 or 6-phenylpicoloinic acid N-oxide 46 with pyrrolopyridine amine 8 produced pyridine analogue 47 and pyridine N-oxide 4. Structure-Activity Relationships and Structural Studies 2-Pyridone analogues with hydrophobic phenyl substituents 2 and 13 (Table 1) displayed potent Met kinase inhibitory activities with IC50 values in the single digit nanomolar range. An X-ray crystal structure of 2 bound to the Met kinase domain revealed that it binds to the ATP-binding pocket of the Met protein in an inactive conformation; i.e., the activation loop folds back toward the ATP-binding pocket (Figure 3).16 The DFG motif, which is conserved among kinases and marks the beginning of the activation loop, is observed in the structure, but most of the remaining loop is undefined. The N1 nitrogen of the pyrrolopyridine ring engages in hydrogen bonding with the backbone NH of Met1160 of the hinge region, and the NH of the pyrrolopyridine ring hydrogen-bonds with the Met1160 carbonyl oxygen. The central aminophenyl ring is flanked on one side by the gatekeeper residue Leu1157 and on the opposite face by the side chain of Phe1223 (of the DFG motif) in a faceto-face aromatic interaction. The 2-pyridone carbonyl oxygen hydrogen-bonds with the backbone NH of Asp1222. The 4-fluorophenyl ring lies in a hydrophobic pocket comprising Phe1134, Phe1200, Met1131, and Leu1195.

terminal phenyl ring by tert-butyl or cyclopropyl (14, 15) significantly reduced the kinase inhibitory activitiy, perhaps because both the tert-butyl and cyclopropyl groups are not sufficiently large enough to fill the hydrophobic pocket or lack the aromaticity to engage in -electron interactions with the aromatic residues comprising the pocket. Interestingly, the larger alkyl isopentyl substituted analogue 16 restores most of the inhibitory activity. The weaker activity of the fluorobenzyl 17 compared to the fluorophenyl analogue suggests that the phenyl ring without a methylene linker is optimal for fitting into the hydrophobic pocket. Pyridyl substituted compounds (18, 19) showed good activities, albeit weaker than the phenyl substituted analogues. The hydrophobic pocket does not appear to tolerate

a polar substituent as seen with the poor activity of phenylcarboxamide 20. However, the poor activity of 20 may alternatively be attributed to the fact that the pocket appears limited in size in the para-substituent direction. The antiproliferative cellular activity of the Met inhibitors was evaluated in vitro using the GTL-16 gastric carcinoma cell line. GTL-1617 is a subclone derived from MKN-45,18 a poorly differentiated gastric carcinoma cell line carrying an amplification of the Met gene. The Met protein in the GTL-16 cell line is constitutively activated as observed by HGF ligand independent phosphorylation.19,20 The GTL-16 cell line was previously shown to be highly sensitive to small molecule inhibitors of Met20,21 and was adopted to be the primary in vitro cell line for screening Met inhibitors. In addition to these cell lines, inhibitors were routinely evaluated in the N87 gastric carcinoma cell line lacking Met activation.22 Compounds 2 and 13 possess potent antiproliferative cellular activities against the GTL-16 gastric tumor cell line, while they lack cellular activity (IC50 > 5 µM) against the N87 cell line (Table 1). We believe the antiproliferative cellular activity difference in these two cell lines suggests that the Met receptor is the target of cellular growth inhibition. As an extension of the 2-pyridone chemotype, 4-pyridone analogues (3, 34, 37, 41-43, Table 2) were also prepared. The SAR of the 4-pyridones is consistent with predictions from the X-ray crystal structure of Met kinase bound to 2-pyridone analogue 2, which reveals that the unsubstituted positions of the pyridinone ring are viable vectors for derivatization. The environment around the N-1 region of the 4-pyridinone ring is directed toward helix RC, which displayed mobility in its orientation in the X-ray structures (data not shown). The SAR revealed little difference in in vitro Met kinase inhibitory activity of analogues with N-1 substituents of different size and hydrophobicity (IC50 ) 2.3-5.9 nM), which confirmed the flexibility of this region of the protein. All of these 4-pyridone analogues exhibit potent antiproliferative cellular activities

against the GTL-16 gastric tumor cell line with good selectivity over the N87 cell line. Interestingly, pyrone 40 shows only weak activity despite its overall structural similarity. It is speculated that the vinylogous amide carbonyl in the 4-pyridone analogues makes it more basic and hence a better hydrogen bond acceptor than the carbonyl in pyrone 40. With the concept that the carbonyl oxygen of the pyridone analogues plays an important role in hydrogen-bonding with the backbone NH of Asp1222, the pyridine and pyridine N-oxide analogues were prepared (Table 3). Pyridine N-oxides 4 and49 displayed potent Met kinase inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 1.3 and 1.8 nM, respectively, while pyridine analogue 47 showed much weaker inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 470 nM. Compounds 4 and 49 also possess potent antiproliferative cellular activities against GTL-16 with IC50 of 40 nM with good selectivity over the N87 cell line. Despite the presence of a basic pyridine nitrogen in 47, it would likely be positioned at a longer distance than the N-oxide oxygen from the hydrogen-bonding partner backbone NH of Asp1222, which results in a weaker activity than the N-oxide compounds. Compound 2 was screened broadly against many other kinases, and some of its kinase activitites are shown in Table

4. In addition to potent Met kinase inhibitory activity, compound 2 also exhibits potent inhibitory activities notably against Flt-3 (IC50 ) 4 nM) and VEGFR-2 (IC50 ) 27 nM) kinases with weaker activities against LCK and c-kit kinases. In Vitro Metabolic Stability and Pharmacokinetics of Compound 2. Compound 2 showed good metabolic stability in both human and mouse liver microsomes with metabolic rates of <0.01 and 0.055 (nmol/min)/mg of protein, respectively, at a concentration of 3 µM. Pharmacokinetic parameters of compound 2 in mice after iv (5 mg/kg) and po (10 mg/kg) dosing are summarized in Table 5. The systemic serum clearance (Cl) of compound 2 was about 10% of hepatic blood flow, and the large steady state volume of distribution (Vss ) 1.6 L/kg) is indicative of extensive extravascular distribution. Compound 2 demonstrated a favorable half-life (t1/2 ) 2.2 h) and mean residence time (MRT ) 4.5 h) after po dosing. The measured oral bioavailability of compound 2 was 100% from a solution formulation of 70:30 PEG 400/water. The serum protein binding of compound 2 was high (99.4 ( 0.3% and 99.9 ( 0% in mouse and human serum, respectively) using the equilibrium dialysis method at a concentration of 10 µM.

evaluated against GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma cell line xenografts in nude mice. Good in vivo efficacy was observed at multiple dose levels, as shown in Figure 4. Treatment of compound 2 (po, qd) was initiated 14 days after tumor implantation, at which time tumors were staged to a volume of approximately 125 mm3. Antitumor activity of 2 was dose proportional. Tumor regressions were observed at 50 and 100 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose.23 At 25 mg/kg, this compound induced complete tumor stasis, and the minimum efficacious dose was identified at 12.5 mg/kg, based on greater than or equal to 50% tumor growth inhibition for more than one tumor volume doubling time (7 days). Compound 2, however, was ineffective at the 6.25 mg/kg dose level. Although we cannot quantify the level of contribution from VEGFR-2 inhibition to the antitumor efficacy of compound 2, it is likely VEGFR-2 inhibition contributed to the in vivo antitumor activity because of its important role in angiogenesis.24 In order to confirm the in vivo

antitumor activity of compound 2 in the GTL-16 model is due to inhibition of Met kinase phosphorylation levels of the Met protein in the GTL-16, tumor extracts from the tumor bearing animals were examined (Figure 5). Both subefficacious (6.25 mg/kg) and maximally efficacious (25 mg/kg) dose levels were evaluated. As indicated in Figure 5, Met receptor phosphorylation remained relatively unchanged at the subefficacious dose (6.25 mg/kg). At the maximally efficacious dose (25 mg/kg), complete and sustained inhibition of Met receptor phosphorylation was observed up to 8 h, and at 24 h, phosphorylated Met levels began returning to control levels. The Met receptor phosphorylation levels are consistent with the in vivo antitumor efficacy results demonstrated by the compound.

resulted in a series of potent Met kinase inhibitors. Many of these analogues also demonstrated potent antiproliferative cellular activity in the Met-dependent gastric carcinoma GTL16 cell line while lacking cellular activity against the Metindependent N87 cell line. Compound 2 also possesses potent inhibitory activity against Flt-3 and VEGFR-2 kinases. Compound 2 showed favorable metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties, and it demonstrated good in vivo efficacy in a GTL16 human gastric carcinoma xenograft model upon oral administration in nude mice. Tumor regressions were observed in the GTL-16 tumor model at 50 and 100 mg/kg, and the minimum efficacious dose was 12.5 mg/kg. Phosphorylation of the Met receptor in GTL-16 tumor extracts decreased in a time and dose dependent manner, consistent with the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the Met-driven GTL-16 tumor model.

Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a final concentration of 8%. TCA precipitates were collected onto GF/C unifilter plates (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) using a Filtermate universal harvester (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT), and the filters were quantitated using a TopCount 96-well liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of substrate phosphorylation (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at 10 concentrations, in duplicate. Cellular Proliferation Assay. Inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by a MTS assay using a CellTiter 96 aqueous nonradioactive proliferation assay kit (Promega). Cells were inoculated into 96-well microtiter plates containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air, and 100% relative humidity for 24 h prior to addition of drug. At the time of drug addition, one plate of the cell line was processed using the above kit to represent a measurement of the cell population at the time of drug addition. Following drug addition, the plates were incubated for an additional 72 h before processing to measure the cell population.

Each compound was tested at eight different concentrations in triplicate, as was a control sample. Growth inhibition of 50% (IC50) is calculated by analysis of the data in Excel using a four-parameter logistic equation with data fitted using the Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm. Metabolic Stability. The compound was incubated with human liver microsomes purchased from In Vitro Technologies (Baltimore, MD) and pooled from 10 individual donors. The rates of oxidative metabolism were measured under the following conditions: compound (substrate) at 3 µM final concentration; final microsomal protein concentration of approximately 1 mg/mL; 1 mM NADPH; 56 mM of pH 7.4 potassium phosphate buffer. Incubations were performed at 37 °C and were initiated by the addition of the substrate. Incubations were quenched by the addition of one volume of acetonitrile after 10 min. Samples were then analyzed for the parent compound by LC/MS. The rate of metabolism was calculated by determining the nanomoles of parent compound oxidized and dividing it by the time of incubation and the milligrams of protein.

To evaluate the oral bioavailability of compound 2 in male Balb/C mice, a single dose was administered as a solution in PEG 400/water (70:30) by either tail vein injection (iv, 5 mg/kg) or by oral gavage (po, 10 mg/kg). The mice were fasted overnight prior to dosing and fed 4 h postdose. A total of 18 mice were used in the study (n ) 9 each for iv and po group). Three serum samples were collected from each mouse, the first two samples by retro-orbital bleed (100 µL/20-25 g mouse) and the third sample by cardiac puncture. Blood samples were collected at 0.17, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h time points following iv dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h following oral dosing. Blood samples were allowed to clot on ice and were centrifuged, and serum was harvested. Serum samples were stored at -20 °C until analysis. Concentrations of parent compound were later determined by LC/MS/MS. Composite serum concentration-time profiles were constructed for pharmacokinetic analysis. Serum Protein Binding of Compound 2. The extent of protein binding of compound 2 was determined in mouse and human sera using the equilibrium dialysis method. All experiments were carried out using pooled serum (n ) 10 for mice, n ) 3 for human) obtained from Bioreclamation Inc. (Hicksville, NY). Compound 2 (1 mM) in acetonitrile was added to serum at a ratio of 1:100 to give a final concentration of 10 µM. Serum samples were dialyzed against 134 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The Micro-Equilibrium Dialyzer (500 µL chamber volume, Amika Corp., Holliston, MA) containing spiked serum was incubated in a shaking water bath maintained at 37 °C for 4 h. A 10 000 molecular weight cutoff dialysis membrane (Amika Corp., Holliston, MA) was used. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Aliquots of buffer and serum were taken at 4 h and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Compound 2 was stable under these conditions over the 4 h incubation period in mouse and human serum. From each dialysis cell, the free and bound drug percentages were calculated as follows: % free ) 100 × (concentration in buffer)/(concentration in serum); % bound ) 100 - (% free). In Vivo Antitumor Activity in the Subcutaneously Implanted GTL-16 Xenograft Model in Nude Mice. Female Balb/C athymic (nu+/nu+)mice,6-8weeksold,wereobtainedfromSprague-Dawley Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were provided with food and water ad libitum and housed five per cage. Mice were maintained in accordance with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) guidelines for the humane treatment and care of laboratory mice. GTL-16 tumor fragments maintained by serial passage in vivo were implanted subcutaneously in the hind flank using an 18 g trocar. Approximately 2 weeks after implant, when tumor sizes reached 100-150 mm3, oral dosing was initiated using gavage needles with either compound at the indicated concentrations or vehicle (7:3 PEG 400/H2O) in the control group. Tumor growth was assessed twice weekly by vernier caliper measurement. Group sizes were n ) 8 or 9.

Antitumor activity was determined by calculating the maximum percent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of treated animals using the formula % TGI ) {(Ct - Tt)/(Ct - C0)} × 100, where Ct is the median tumor volume (mm3) of vehicle treated control (C) mice at time t. Tt is the median tumor volume of treated mice (T) at time t. C0 is the median tumor volume of control mice at time 0. Activity is defined as a continuous % TGI > 50% for at least one tumor volume doubling time after the start of drug treatment. Measurement of Phospho Met Protein Levels in GTL-16 Tumor Extracts. GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma cell line xenografts were implanted in nude mice and allowed to grow to 200-300 mm3 as previously described. Mice were given a single oral dose of compound 2. At the indicated time points, mice were sacrificed and tumors immediately excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tumors were homogenized and lysed in ice cold buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 0.12 M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 5% glycerol, 1 mM sodium vanadate, and 40 µM ammonium molybdate, with protease inhibitors (Complete Tabs, Boehringer Mannheim). The protein concentration of tumor lysates was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Approximately 500 µg of total protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-hMet clone C-12 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) linked to immunopure immobilized protein A/G resin (Pierce) for 3 h in lysis buffer, shaking at 4 °C. Lysates were washed 3 times and resuspended in Lane Marker Reducing Sample Buffer (Pierce). Protein was denatured and separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (BioRad) and transferred onto pretreated nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad). Membranes were blocked using LiCor Odyssey blocking buffer. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution containing 0.1% Tween-20. Two color Western blots were performed using rabbit anti-hMet C-12 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine PY-20 antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories). For detection, goat antimouse Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) and goat antirabbit IRDye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals) antibodies diluted 1:10000 were utilized. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies simultaneously for 2 h at room temperature, washed with Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with both IRlabeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were imaged and quantified using the Li-Cor Odyssey imaging system. Crystal Structure of Met Kinase Complexed with Compound 2. Crystals of the Met kinase domain (1067-1378) complexed with compound 2 were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The hanging drop consisted of 10 of the concentrated Met kinase complex mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 12% MEPEG 5k, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.1), and 11% 2-propanol. Crystals were flash-frozen in cryoprotectant containing 15% glycerol, and data were collected at the IMCA-CAT beamline ID17 at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL (Table 6).
