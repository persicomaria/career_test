Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and Interleukin-5 (IL-5) have overlapping, pleiotropic effects on hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and early progenitor cells. The high-affinity receptors for human GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 share a common -subunit (h c), which is essential for signalling and plays a major role in recruiting intracellular signalling molecules. While activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase JAK2 appears to be the initiating event for signalling, the immediate events that trigger this are still unclear. We have isolated a number of activated mutants of h c, which can be grouped into classes defined by their state of receptor phosphorylation, their requirement for subunit as a cofactor, and their activities in primary cells and cell lines. We discuss these findings with regard to the stoichiometry, activation, and signalling of the normal GM-CSF IL-3 IL-5 receptor complexes. Specifically, this work has implications for the role of the ligand-specific -subunits in initiating the signalling through the -subunit, the role of subunit dimerization as a receptor trigger, and the function of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in generating growth and survival signals. Based on the properties of the activated mutants and the recent structures of erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R) complexes, we propose a model in which (1) activation of h c can occur via alternative states that differ with respect to stoichiometry and subunit assembly, but which all mediate proliferative responses, and (2) each of the different classes of activated mutants mimics one of these alternative states. © 2000 International Society for Experimental Hematology.

The receptors for GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 The GM-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and Interleukin-5 (IL-5) receptor complexes (GMR, IL3R, and IL5R) have been reviewed in detail previously [1,2]. Each is comprised of a unique ligand-specific -subunit (GMR , IL3R , or IL5R ) and a shared subunit (h c), which appears to be the primary signalling subunit [3,4]. In the mouse, there is also a second, closely related subunit (m IL3) which functions only in conjunction with the IL-3 receptor subunit (mILR ) [5]. The receptor subunits or GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 are all members of the cytokine receptor (CR) superfamily [6­8], which is characterised by a two-hundred amino acid extracellular CR module (CRM) comprising two fibronectin-like barrel structures called CR domains

(CRD) [9]. The seven strands in each CRD are designated A­G, and within the membrane-distal CRD there are two pairs of disulfide-linked cysteine residues. The membraneproximal CRD of nearly all CRs contains a highly conserved motif with the consensus Trp-Ser-Xaa-Trp-Ser, referred to as the "WSXWS box". Other members of the CR family include the receptor subunits for growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), erythropoietin (Epo), thrombopoietin (Tpo), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-11, IL-15, Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin-M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), Cardiotropin, the p40 subunit of IL-12, and most recently the leptin receptor [10]. Members of the CR family do not possess any known intrinsic enzymatic activities associated with intracellular signalling. All available evidence suggests that triggering of tyrosine kinases associated with the cytoplasmic portions of the signalling subunits is the critical first step in CR signalling. The Janus kinases (JAKs) are of particular importance

[11­15] and interact through the membrane-proximal region (Box 1) of CR-signalling subunits [16­19]. JAKs appear to be constitutively associated with CR cytoplasmic domains, although there is a ligand-inducible augmentation following stimulation in most CRs (see Reference 20). The nature of the receptor trigger and the mechanism of JAK activation are still uncertain. However, it is thought that JAK activation occurs by cross-phosphorylation following receptor aggregation [21­23]. While the JAKs are clearly important for CR activation, there is now ample evidence that specificity of signalling is determined by factors other than the JAKs [24]. Activated JAKs are believed to initiate phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor subunits and on other intracellular signalling molecules, including "adaptors" such as Shc, as well as receptor-associated latent transcription factors (STATs, [25,26]). The predominant JAK activated in response to IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 is JAK2 [19,27,28], and, as expected, its activation requires an intact Box 1 region in c [29]. No biological or biochemical responses have been detected in the absence of JAK2, and prevention of JAK2 activation abrogates all responses that have been examined [30,19,31]. A major unresolved issue pertaining to the GMR IL3R IL5R system is the stoichiometry of the active receptor complex. Recent studies on disulphide-linked IL3R complexes [32,2], chemical crosslinking [33], and studies employing a dominant-negative hGMR [33] all suggest the existence of higher-order complexes. Most evidence is consistent with

the generation of a 2 2 tetrameric complex with ligand, stabilized by intersubunit disulphide linkages [2]. However, a simple 1 1 structure cannot be ruled out, and indeed forced heterodimerization of - and subunit cytoplasmic domains is sufficient for mitogenic signalling [34,35]. In this review, we discuss the immediate events in activation of the receptors for GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 in the light of information obtained from constitutively activated h c mutants and recent studies with the normal receptor complexes. We discuss the implications of these studies with regard to receptor stoichiometry, JAK2 activation, the signalling role of the ligand-specific subunits and the significance of subunit phosphorylation on tyrosine.

Classes of h c activating mutations A number of activating h c mutants have been generated, either spontaneously or by random and site-directed mutagenesis of the h c cDNA. All of the activated forms of h c tested to date have oncogenic potential in that they can convert the nontumorigenic cell line, FDC-P1 to tumorigenicity [36­38]. Furthermore, when expressed in murine transgenic or bone marrow reconstitution systems, these mutants disrupt hematopoiesis leading to myeloproliferative disorders or acute leukemia (References 39 and 40). These properties and the potential role in hematopoietic disease have been discussed previously [41]. A summary of the known acti-

vated h c mutants' is shown diagrammatically in Figure 1 and their properties are summarised in Table 1. Biochemical and biological properties As shown in Figure 1, activation of h c can occur in response to a range of receptor alterations. Changes in the membrane proximal domain (CRD4) caused by duplication of receptor sequence, or amino acid substitution, have been shown to lead to constitutive receptor signalling [37,36,42] as has truncation of the h c extracellular domain [38]. A small deletion in the A-B loop of CRD3 is the only extracellular mutation outside of CRD4 that results in constitutive receptor signalling (R.J. D'Andrea, unpublished 1999). In addition to these extracellular activating mutations, there are a number of transmembrane mutants (see References 36,42) and two recently described activating mutations in the membrane-proximal region of the h c cytoplasmic domain [42]. In this review, we will focus on the properties of the extracellular and transmembrane mutants as these have been characterized in most detail. Distinct abilities to signal in hematopoietic cells Normal human GM-CSF IL-3 IL-5 receptors allow liganddependent survival and proliferation when introduced into several different murine cytokine-dependent cell lines (e.g., FDC-P1, Ba F3 and CTLL-2; References 3,43,44,4), and the behavior of several constitutive mutants has also been studied extensively in these cell lines. Fundamental differences between receptor mutants are clearly demonstrated by their

abilities to mediate a growth response in distinct subsets of factor-dependent hematopoietic cell lines (see Table 1). For example, neither the V449E transmembrane mutant nor the I374N or FI extracellular mutants confer factor-independence on the murine T cell line CTLL-2. This is despite the observation that they can function in a ligand-dependent fashion in these cells when co-expressed with hGMR [36]. Moreover V449E, and another transmembrane mutant, A459D [36,42], were able to induce factor-independence in the pro-B cell line Ba F3*, while none of the extracellular mutants--including point mutants [36,42,45], FI [37], and the truncation mutants [38]--were able to do so. A functional screen for molecules derived from FDC-P1 cells that are required for activation of the I374N mutant in Ba F3 cells resulted in the isolation of the GMR subunit [46]. This implies that the GM-CSF receptor -subunit plays an active role in constitutive function of the extracellular mutant and, indeed, biochemical studies have confirmed that mutant, but not wild-type h c associates spontaneously with mGMR [46]. Moreover, it has also been shown that mGMR is sufficient to allow constitutive activity of I374N in CTLL-2 cells [46], confirming that activity of this mutant is independent of the presence of mouse subunits (CTLL-2 cells do not express m c or m IL3). The complementation observed in the presence of mGMR is surprising because in previous experiments we had shown

that neither human GMR nor IL3R from either species could allow constitutive activity of I374N in Ba F3 cells [36,45]. As can be seen from Table 1, mGMR also cooperates with most of the other extracellular point mutants (as well as FI and QP; D'Andrea, unpublished data, 1999) to confer factor-independent growth in Ba F3 cells. The basis for this species-specific interaction is not presently understood, although studies with mouse-human chimaeric GMR subunits define the extracellular domain of mGMR as a key determinant [46]. The requirement for mGMR in preference to hGMR is not absolute for all mutants, as we have recently found that the duplication mutant FI demonstrates constitutive activity with either -subunit (D'Andrea, unpublished data, 1999). Clearly, however, association with hGMR is not sufficient for activation as wild-type h c can exist in a preformed complex with hGMR [47]. When introduced into primary hematopoietic cells from mouse fetal liver, the I374N and FI mutants conferred factor-independence only on the granulocyte-macrophage (GM) sublineage [48]. This is most likely a consequence of the requirement that these mutants have for GMR , since GM progenitors are known to respond to GM-CSF and express mGMR . In contrast, V449E could confer growth factor-independence on a wide range of hematopoietic cell types in addition to those derived from the GM lineage. This difference is not solely due to the requirement of I374N FI for GMR , because even myeloid cells from V449E-infected cultures showed greater proliferation and generated morphologically distinct cell types in liquid cultures [48]. Differential phosphorylation on tyrosine Mutant forms of h c can also be distinguished by their ability to undergo receptor subunit tyrosine phosphorylation. As summarised in Table 1, the constitutive h c mutants activate the Jak-STAT pathway in the absence of ligand (measured as JAK2 phosphorylation and STAT5 DNA-binding activity), the Ras pathway (assessed by phosphorylation of the Erk1 2 MAP kinases) [42] and the PI-3 kinase AKT pathway (measured by phosphorylation of AKT; T. Blake and T.J. Gonda, unpublished data, 1998). However, only the transmembrane mutants, V449E and A459D, and the R461C mutant exhibit detectable constitutive subunit tyrosine phosphorylation [42]. Thus, activation of the Ras, STAT and AKT pathways, and indeed cell proliferation, may not always require subunit tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with this, a mutant of h c (YALLF) in which all eight cytoplasmic tyrosine residues were replaced by phenylalanine [49,50] still displays JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation and mediates a mitogenic response to growth factor. However, YALLF shows a reduced capacity to phosphorylate some cellular proteins (i.e., SHC and SHP2) and requires higher than normal levels of ligand for mitogenic signalling, suggesting that an absence of tyrosine phosphorylation reduces but does not completely abolish signalling.

In contrast, cellular proliferation and activation of the JAK, STAT, Erk1 2 and AKT, pathways by I374N occurs at levels equivalent to cells receiving maximal growth factor stimulation or rendered factor-independent by the constitutively phosphorylated V499E mutant (Reference 42 and T.J. Gonda, unpublished data, 1999). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that I374N has a low level of subunit phosphorylation on tyrosine that is undetectable in the phosphorylation assays. These differences in receptor phosphorylation clearly imply that there are fundamental differences in the nature of the activated complexes formed by the different classes of mutants. In particular, there is a clear distinction between a class of mutants that associate spontaneously with mGMR , require this association for signalling, and do not exhibit constitutive receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine, and another class that do not require a GMR subunit, but which display constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation. Later in this review we present a model that incorporates the unique properties of each class of mutant and current knowledge from recent published studies with wild-type h c receptor complexes.

Possible mechanisms of activation by h c mutations and implications for the mechanism of normal receptor function CRD4 substitutions: evidence for conformational changes involved in activation A number of activating substitutions within CRD4 have been identified by random [36,42] and site-directed [45] mutagenesis (see Table 1). We have previously suggested that CRD4 acts as a conformational switch and that, in the absence of ligand, it is constrained in an inactive conformation through interactions involving CRD3 [38,41]. An "active" conformation that can trigger JAK2 would normally be induced by ligand in association with subunit. Interestingly, the activating mutations affect residues outside of the key ligand-binding epitopes. Determination of the wild-type CRD4 structure by NMR (C. Bagley et al., submitted for publication) has confirmed that the majority of these mutations substitute hydrophilic amino acids for hydrophobic residues that normally interact to form the core of CRD4. It is likely that this leads to a partial unfolding or decreased rigidity of the membrane-proximal domain that may result in a proportion of receptor molecules being in the "active" form. Similarly, the FI duplication [37] is also likely to perturb the normal CRD4 structure. The fact that only a small number of receptor molecules need be triggered for a maximal response in most receptor systems may explain how a large number of different activating mutations can result in similar levels of activation. Some new insights into the nature of inactive CR structures have been provided recently by the structure of an un-

liganded Epo-R dimer [51]. The unliganded receptor forms a unique homodimeric structure that is stabilized by interactions between loops provided by the CR domains. Comparisons of liganded [52,53] and unliganded structures, and the use of a protein fragment complementation system [54] have demonstrated that a ligand-induced conformational change in the preformed Epo-R dimer is required for receptor activation. This conformational change in the receptor dimer results in cytoplasmic domains and associated JAK kinases being brought into close proximity [54]. Whether this unliganded receptor structure is common amongst other members of the CR family is unclear, however other CRs, including h c, have been reported to exist as preformed homodimers (see References 55,56). It should be noted that h c has also been observed in an unliganded complex [47]. Either, or both, of these complexes could resemble the Epo-R complex described above. Using extensive site-directed mutagenesis and neutralizing antibodies, it has been demonstrated that there are crucial contacts between ligand and h c within CRD4, including the B-C and F-G loops (see References 2,57­60). The corresponding loops in Epo-R are intimately involved in formation of the inactive dimer [51], suggesting that ligand binding may be directly effecting this conformational switch in h c. By analogy, we suggest that in the presence of disruptive CRD4 mutations the unliganded or conformation is altered, allowing spontaneous association and formation of a functional complex with the GMR subunit. Receptor truncations: spontaneous assembly in the absence of the ability to form inactive complexes A deletion ( H) of h c that generates a truncated receptor equivalent to the oncogenic form (v-Mpl) of the Tpo receptor (c-Mpl) (i.e., containing only part of CRD4) has been shown to allow factor-independent proliferation of FDC-P1 cells [38]. The critical event appears to be the loss of CRD3, since a truncation mutant ( QP) of h c that retained all of CRD4, but removed CRDs 1, 2 and 3 was also activating, whereas removal of only CRDs 1 and 2 was insufficient to promote factor-independent proliferation [38]. However, some sequences within CRD4 are required for constitutive receptor activity, since the most severe truncation tested, which left only 7 residues of CRD4, was inactive. Like the CRD4 substitutions, the extracellular truncation mutant QP also requires the presence of mGMR , as it lacks the ability to induce factor independence in Ba F3 cells [38] unless mGMR is also present (R.J. D'Andrea, unpublished data, 1999). Removal of CRD3 may prevent formation of inactive or complexes, resulting in a less rigid conformation of CRD4 and spontaneous association with GMR . Transmembrane mutations: activation by receptor homodimerization Random mutagenesis also resulted in the isolation of activating mutations that affect the transmembrane domain of

h c [36,42]. These mutations (V449E, A459D, L445Q) result in the replacement of hydrophobic residues with charged or polar amino acids in the central portion of the transmembrane domain. Mutations corresponding to V449E in both murine subunits have also been constructed and shown to induce factor-independent proliferation of FDCP1 cells (M. McCormack and T.J. Gonda, unpublished data, 1995). The transmembrane mutants exhibit a number of properties that suggest they are activated by a mechanism that is fundamentally different to that of the extracellular mutants discussed above (see Table 1). It is highly likely that receptor dimerization is the mechanism of activation for these mutants. There is strong evidence that an analogous transmembrane mutation (V644E) in the Neu ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) [61] induces constitutive receptor dimerization [62,63], and this is further supported by the existence of activating transmembrane mutants in other RTKs (e.g., the fibroblast growth factor receptor, [64]). The idea that the transmembrane mutants of h c form constitutive dimers is consistent with the observation that they exhibit some properties similar to receptor chimeras in which forced h c dimerization occurs upon ligand stimulation. A chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of Epo-R and the cytoplasmic domain of murine IL-3 allowed Epo-dependent proliferation in Ba F3, but not in CTLL-2 cells [65]. Like V449E and A459D, the chimera is predicted to form a homodimer (in the presence of Epo) and as would be expected, is phosphorylated on tyrosine. Enforced dimerization of the intracellular domains of the subunit may therefore be sufficient for activity in Ba F3 (and FDC-P1) cells but not CTLL-2 cells. This is strikingly reminiscent of the ability of Epo-R to signal in Ba F3 cells but not lymphoid cell lines (see Reference 66) and suggests that an accessory protein(s), that is not present in T cell lines, is necessary to induce proliferative signals from these homodimerized CRs.

A model for assembly of active h

c

containing complexes

The properties of mutant receptors suggest at least two alternative forms of GM-CSF IL-3 IL-5­signalling complexes We have suggested previously that extracellular activating h c mutations lead to conformational changes and spontaneous formation of complexes, which mimic those resulting from ligand stimulation [38,41]. As mentioned earlier, growth factor binding is likely to result in formation of an 2 2 tetramer with ligand (see References 2,32,33). In the model presented in Figure 2, we suggest that h c can exist in at least two alternative active complexes, each of which can deliver proliferative, survival, and at least some differentiative signals. Each of the major classes of constitutive mutants (extracellular CRD4 substitutions, extracellular truncations, and transmembrane mutations) represents one

236

of these states. This model can account for the differential requirement for association with GMR subunit and differences in tyrosine phosphorylation. We speculate that the first state, represented by the CRD4 point and duplication mutants, is an incompletely assembled complex in which not all of the intersubunit interactions that define the mature 2 2 complex are in place. To produce such a complex we propose that a change in conformation of an unliganded complex induces spontaneous formation of a functional complex with GMR . This may result in JAK activation by cross-phosphorylation (Fig. 2, Model A), leading to a complex which is partially competent for eliciting intracellular signals. This would be consistent with the current model of JAK activation and the observation that other receptors that utilize JAK2 (i.e., receptors for Epo, growth hormone, prolactin, leptin and Tpo) are activated as homodimeric complexes. The signalling complex formed is clearly not equivalent to the mature complex comprizing wild-type h c, as there is no detectable h c tyrosine phosphorylation. It is possible that as a result of the incomplete assembly of the complex, JAK activation does not result in phosphorylation of h c intracellular tyrosine residues. This may be because the cytoplasmic tail of h c is incorrectly oriented with regard to JAK2. An alternative explanation is that JAK2 is not directly responsible for all receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and that incomplete assembly of the complex prohibits binding or activation of a downstream kinase(s) essential for receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. A second possibility (Fig. 2, Model B) is that these mutants form incompletely assembled complexes that are simple heterodimers with the subunit in an "active" conformation. This would be consistent with formation during normal receptor assembly of an active intermediate comheterodimer. Formation of such a complex prised of an may occur through a conformational change that is induced by the ligand or extracellular mutation. Studies with chimeric molecules, which allow forced heterodimerization of and subunits suggest that a GMR signalling complex of this type can generate a mitogenic signal [34,35]. These experiments clearly demonstrate the potential of a simple heterodimer to signal mitogenesis, however, they do not rule out the possibility that a higher order complex is generated that can provide an amplified signal. Neither Patel et al. [34] or Orban et al. [35] examined subunit phosphorylation on tyrosine, and it remains possible that the complexes formed in both experiments represent the intermediate complex shown in Figure 2. In the case of the GMR, a mechanism other than transphosphorylation by JAK2 would presumably be responsible for JAK2 activation in the intermediate, as JAK2 does not associate with GMR [29]. Other kinases activated rapidly in response to GM-CSF (see later discussion) are candidates for a role in this process. On the other hand, IL5R has been reported to be associated with JAK2 [35,67] suggesting that activation of JAK2 in a

simple IL5R h c heterodimer maybe occurring by JAK transphosphorylation. The transmembrane mutants result in complexes that we predict mimic the h c dimer present in the mature 2 2 complex. A hallmark of these mutants is subunit tyrosine phosphorylation, which probably requires a specific juxtaposition of receptor cytoplasmic domains and activated JAK2 molecules. This state can result from formation of the mature, higher-order, disulphide-linked 2 2 complex, in the case of the wild-type receptor and ligand, or as a result of subunit dimerization predicted to occur with the V449E mutant and in chimaeras formed by the extracellular domains of homodimeric receptors, such as Epo-R and the intracellular domain of c or IL-3 (e.g., Reference 65). Taken together with data from cysteine substitution mutants of the normal receptor (References 32,68; also see below), it is likely that h c becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine only in complexes containing mature h c dimers. This would also be consistent with the notion that -subunits are phosphorylated in trans by a subunit-associated tyrosine kinase following the initial triggering event. Also consistent with this model, the activated CRD4 substitution mutants can become phosphorylated on tyrosine in the presence of hGMR and hGM-CSF (reference 42 and Table 1), suggesting that they can progress to form a completely assembled 2 2 complex in the presence of ligand.

Supportive evidence from studies with wild type GMR IL3R IL5R As discussed above, several lines of evidence imply the existence of higher-order, disulphide-linked complexes containing multiple and subunits [32,68,2,33]. Importantly, phosphotyrosine is detected only in h c present in the disulphide-linked IL3R complexes [32,68]. If formation of high MW complexes is prevented by mutation of cysteine residues in CRD1 (C86 and C91) to alanine then subunit phosphorylation on tyrosine is abolished in response to IL-3 [68]. However, these mutants are still capable of transducing proliferative signals, as their introduction into CTLL cells, along with the hIL-3R subunit, can allow IL-3­ dependent proliferation at rates comparable to that seen with wild type h c [69]. Thus, we suggest that, in the presence of IL-3, the C86A and C91A mutants are unable to form the mature disulphide-linked 2 2 complex, even though ligand binding is unaffected (see Fig. 2). We suggest that the complex formed may be incompletely assembled and similar to the hypophosphorylated intermediate formed by the extracellular CRD4 mutants (Fig. 2), as neither complex exhibits detectable h c tyrosine phosphorylation. The observation that complexes formed by the C86A and C91A mutants are capable of delivering growth signals again emphasizes that the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation in proliferative signalling in response to GM-CSF or IL-3 is probably not absolute.

Figure 2. Model for assembly and activation of h c receptor complexes. Mutant forms of h c are indicated as representing intermediate or alternative forms of ligand-induced complexes. h c is shown in blue; GMR in red. In the absence of ligand it is predicted that h c exists in a preformed complex with either hGMR or another h c molecule. In unstimulated cells JAK2 (yellow) is bound to the Box 1 region of c [19,29,113­115]. Interaction with ligand (green), or activating mutations in CRD4, alter the conformation of the h c and induce formation of a functional complex with GMR . Two alternative models are proposed for the structure of the intermediate complexes and the subsequent events required for formation of the mature complex. In both models initial JAK2 activation requires the subunit cytoplasmic domain or an associated cofactor (grey). We speculate that there may be a subsequent event (i.e., receptor realignment or further receptor aggregation) required for complete JAK activation or to permit consequent tyrosine phosphorylation of h c (thick red arrows). This may result in amplification or modification of the intracellular signal e.g., by recruitment of further signalling molecules to h c (see text for further discussion).

Implications for intracellular signalling by the GM-CSF IL-3 IL-5 receptors Possible roles for the -subunit in receptor activation Several studies have shown that mutation or deletion of the short cytoplasmic domains of the ligand-specific subunits abolishes signalling with no affect on ligand binding [70­ 77]. Taken together with the complementation of the I374N mutant in Ba F3 cells by the murine GMR subunit [46], these results provide strong evidence that the subunits play a role in receptor triggering. These short cytoplasmic domains have also been shown to be important in determining the specificity of the biological response [78], but how they function is still far from clear. Deletions from the C-terminus of hGMR define the membrane-proximal 29 amino acids as essential for signalling [77,79,73]. Within this region is a segment of high conservation previously noted for its homology to the "PROX" domain from c, the receptor subunit shared by the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 receptors (Reference 80; see Fig. 3). This region of c is functionally similar to the membrane-proximal region of the subunit in that it is absolutely required for JAK activation and mitogenesis [80­83]. The PROX domain was also shown to be required for a truncated version of c to induce JAK-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of IL2R and SHP2 [84] consistent with this domain, inducing an initial, JAK-independent signal. Other CR signalling subunits may provide similar or overlapping functions to those derived from the PROX domain, as the cytoplasmic domain of c can be replaced with the membrane proximal region of Epo-R [85]. A Tpo-R mutant that does not activate any of the JAK kinases but still exhibits a ligand-induced mitogenic response [86] may be signalling through such a pathway. These studies are consistent with a role for other tyrosine kinases in CR triggering; activation of these kinases, rather than of the JAKs, may be the primary event in CR activation. Certainly, many other kinases are activated very rapidly in response to IL-3 and GM-CSF, including Tec [87], Syk [88] and Lyn [89­91], Yes [91], Fyn [90], Fes [92], and Hck [90,93]. To date, no other molecules have been identified in screens using the small -subunit cytoplasmic domain as "bait." Given its juxtaposition with the plasma membrane it is possible that the role of the short subunit cytoplasmic domain is to bring membrane-associated molecules into proximity with JAK molecules associated with -subunits and or other substrates. Such molecules may not be easily detected in conventional "fishing" experiments. JAK activation Interestingly, despite the observation that forced dimerization of the subunit cytoplasmic domains can initiate a mitogenic response, homodimerization of JAK2 does not appear to be sufficient for signalling (although dimerization of the isolated kinase domains may be, [94]). For example,

chimeric CRs containing JAK2 in place of the cytoplasmic domain do not mediate mitogenic signalling after ligandinduced dimerization [94­96]. This would be consistent with a requirement for an initial signal, emanating from the PROX-homology region, as discussed earlier. It should be noted that truncations of the GMR cytoplasmic domain, which do not affect the PROX-like motif, also abolish signalling [77,73,46], suggesting that other interaction motifs also exist in the subunit cytoplasmic domain. It cannot be ruled out that these essential domains are directly involved in JAK2 association. JAK2 has been shown to associate with IL5R [67,35], however, it has not been demonstrated that either GMR or IL3R bind to JAK2. Role of receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine While all classes of constitutive h c mutants activate the JAK STAT and MAP kinase pathways, the lack of detectable subunit tyrosine phosphorylation of the CRD4 substitution mutants suggest that there are also substantial differences in the intracellular signalling pathways that are activated by each class of mutant. The presence or absence of docking sites for SH2 or PTB domain containing signalling molecules would be expected to profoundly affect the nature of secondary signals elicited. Surprisingly, this was not the case with mutant PDGF receptor that lacks the PLC , PI3K, SHP2 and RasGAP binding sites. This mutant still retains substantial ability to induce 64 out of the 66 immediate early genes induced by wild type PDGF receptor [97] and is still capable of inducing a mitogenic response, albeit at a reduced level. Thus, phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues, at least in this assay, appears to quantitatively affect the level of early gene induction (see Reference 98). Similar quantitative effects on signal strength may account for differences in proliferation and differentiation observed following the introduction of different classes of mutant into primary cells [48,40]. The differences in phosphorylation status between I374N and V449E mutants could contribute to the differences in leukemogenic potential discussed earlier. Mutation of all cytoplasmic tyrosine residues has profound effects on the biological activity of a constitutive Epo-R mutant. Such an alteration in the context of the R129C Epo-R mutant results in marked impairment of its ability to cause growth factor-independent proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-E and BFU-E) and an expansion of the erythroid compartment when introduced into mice as a recombinant retrovirus [99]. However, a limited activity of the YF mutant in this assay confirmed other reports that a low-level response to Epo can be achieved in the absence of Epo-R tyrosine phosphorylation [100­103]. Role of interactions with heterologous receptors Finally, it is of interest to consider an alternative possibility that may explain the mechanism by which extracellular mutants could elicit a range of intracellular signals in the ab-

sence of subunit tyrosine phosphorylation. Several recent reports have revealed that CRs can interact with each other and members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family (see References 104­107). In particular, mEpo-R and m c are constitutively associated in transfected Ba F3 cells [108]. Epo, Tpo, and G-CSF have all been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of subunit [109­112]. So far, there are no reports of phosphorylation of Epo-R or Tpo-R in response to GM-CSF, IL-3, or IL-5. However, these findings raise the possibility that activated h c mutants induce phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosines on other CR or RTKs. In the case of the CRD4 substitution mutants, this may provide docking sites for signalling molecules in a manner analogous to the interaction between GHR and EGF-R [106,107]. In such a case, the spectrum of molecules recruited may overlap with those recruited by phosphorylated h c, but there may also be significant differences resulting in different cellular consequences. Conclusions Several classes of h c-activated mutant have been distinguished by their ability to signal in different subsets of hematopoietic cell lines and primary cells and their capacity to undergo receptor subunit phosphorylation. We speculate that different classes of mutants form fundamentally different complexes that represent intermediate or incompletely assembled forms of the mature ligand-induced complex. The signals generated by the constitutive mutants are likely to differ quantitatively from those elicited by the wild type receptor complexes and may differ qualitatively as well. For example, the mature GMR IL3R IL5R is likely to elicit signals that are amplified relative to those generated by some mutant complexes. Indeed, the signal that is generated by the wild-type receptor complex may represent a combina-

tion of the signals generated by the CRD4 substitution mutants and the transmembrane mutants. These differences may permit a dissection of the roles of the signalling pathways in the absence of multiple overlapping pathways induced in the wild-type complex. With regard to oncogenesis, these differences are of critical importance as the V499E mutant is acutely leukemogenic while the h cFI and I374N mutants lead to myeloproliferative disorders in several mouse models.
