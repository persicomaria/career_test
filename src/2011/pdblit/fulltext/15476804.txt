Restriction endonucleases of the PD...D/EXK family need Mg2+ for DNA cleavage. Whereas Mg2+ (or Mn2+) promotes catalysis, Ca2+ (without Mg2+) only supports DNA binding. The role of Mg2+ in DNA cleavage by restriction endonucleases has elicited many hypotheses, differing mainly in the number of Mg2+ involved in catalysis. To address this problem, we measured the Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence of DNA cleavage by BamHI, BglII, Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII (catalytic domain), MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII, which were reported in co-crystal structure analyses to bind one (BglII and EcoRI) or two (BamHI and NgoMIV) Me2+ per active site. DNA cleavage experiments were carried out at various Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentrations at constant ionic strength. All enzymes show a qualitatively similar Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence. In general, the Mg2+ concentration optimum (between  1 and 10 mM) is higher than the Mn2+ concentration optimum (between  0.1 and 1 mM). At still higher Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentrations, the activities of all enzymes tested are reduced but can be reactivated by Ca2+. Based on these results, we propose that one Mg2+ or Mn2+ is critical for restriction enzyme activation, and binding of a second Me2+ plays a role in modulating the activity. Steady-state kinetics carried out with EcoRI and BamHI suggest that binding of a second Mg2+ or Mn2+ mainly leads to an increase in Km, such that the inhibitory effect of excess Mg2+ or Mn2+ can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration. Our conclusions are supported by molecular dynamics simulations and are consistent with the structural observations of both one and two Me2+ binding to these enzymes.

Introduction
"The detailed mechanism of DNA hydrolysis by enzymes is of significant current interest. One of the most important questions in this respect is the catalytic role of metal ions such as Mg2+. While it is clear that divalent ions play a major role in DNA hydrolysis, it is uncertain what function such cations have in hydrolysis and why two are needed in some cases and only one in others".1 Despite numerous

Although divergent in sequence and structure, these enzymes are characterized by a common core consisting of a mixed -sheet comprising five strands flanked by -helices on both sides.8 The superfamily can be broadly divided into an EcoRI (or ) and an EcoRV (or ) subfamily, depending on whether the fifth -strand is parallel with or antiparallel to the first -strand.9,10 The second and third -strands harbour the catalytic residues of the PD...D/EXK motif, which is not absolutely conserved: the lysine is substituted by glutamic acid in BamHI and by glutamine in BglII, BstYI,11 HinP1I,12 and NotI.13 Furthermore, in Bse634I, Cfr10I, EcoO109I, EcoRII, Ecl18kI, NgoMIV, and PspGI, the second carboxylate of the PD...D/EXK motif comes from a neighbouring -helix, highlighting the importance of spatial, rather than sequence, conservation.14,15 Finally, in SdaI, two amino acid residues separate the E and K of the PD...D/EXK motif.16 The crystal structures of 19 members of the EcoRI family (Table 1), representatives of which we have studied in this paper, have been determined, including 13 co-crystal structures of enzyme­DNA complexes: BamHI, BglII, BsoBI, BstYI, Ecl18kI, EcoRI, EcoO109I, FokI, MunI, NgoMIV, NotI, PspGI,17 and SgrAI.7,18 Six of these co-crystal structures were determined in the presence of divalent metal ions: BamHI with Ca2+ (cognate complex: PDB accession code 2BAM) and Mn2+ (product complex, 3BAM), 19 BglII with Ca 2+ (cognate complex: 1DFM), 20 EcoRI with Mn 2+ (product complex: 1QPS),21 NgoMIV with Mg2+ (product complex: 1FIU),22 NotI with Ca2+ (cognate complex: 3C25),13 and SgrAI with Ca2+ (noncognate complex: 3DPG; cognate complex: 3DVO) and with Mn2+(cognate complex: 3DVO).23 Whereas the structure analyses showed that BamHI, NgoMIV, and NotI have two divalent metal ions bound per active site (subunit), BglII and EcoRI have only one. In the SgrAI structures, one Ca2+ is seen per active site in the noncognate complex versus two Ca2+ per active site in the cognate complex; in the cognate complex with Mn2+, two divalent metal ions are seen, yet one has only partial occupancy (0.3­0.4). In the crystal structure of the complex of EcoO109I with DNA, a metal ion is seen in the catalytic centre, which was interpreted as a Na+ taking the place of the catalytic Mg2+ .24 The question arises whether the number of divalent metal ions seen in substrate and product complexes in the co-crystals of these enzymes can be taken as evidence for the number of Mg 2+ needed for catalysis. Correspondingly, do these enzymes follow the same mechanism in catalyzing phosphodiester bond hydrolysis? To address these problems experimentally, we have measured the Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence of DNA cleavage by selected EcoRI family members: BamHI, BglII, Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII-C (catalytic domain), MboI,

Me2+ Ion-Dependence of Restriction Enzymes

NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII. Steady-state (and in a few cases also single-turnover) DNA cleavage experiments, carried out at a constant ionic strength, show that these enzymes are inhibited at divalent cation concentrations exceeding  10 mM for Mg2+ and 1 mM for Mn2+. We have also carried out experiments with two different divalent metal ions (Mg2+/Mn2+ and Ca2+) to examine the mechanism of DNA cleavage, similarly as reported before.25­28 Intriguingly, all enzymes studied can be activated by Ca2+ to varying degrees, depending on the enzyme and the Mg2+ concentration. Nevertheless, inhibition is also observed at higher Ca2+ concentrations. We conclude that the restriction enzymes of the EcoRI family, possibly all enzymes of the PD...D/EXK superfamily, have two binding sites for divalent cations in their active centre. Whereas binding of one Mg2+ per active centre is necessary and sufficient for DNA cleavage, binding of a second ion may inhibit activity (in case of Mg2+, depending on substrate concentration) and may enhance activity (in case of Ca2+). We propose a one-metal-ion mechanism for DNA binding and cleavage with a modulatory role of the second metal that, at high concentrations, can reduce activity in the case of Mg2+ (Mn2+) (due to an increase in Km) or increase activity in the case of Ca2+ (due to an increase in affinity for Mg2+ binding in site A). Only when Ca2+ ions start to compete with the catalytic Mg2+ at high concentrations of Ca2+ is DNA cleavage inhibited.

Results
We have analyzed the Mg2+ and Mn2+ dependence of DNA cleavage by selected restriction endonucleases of the EcoRI family and the effect of Ca2+ on the rate of DNA cleavage by these enzymes, covering a wide range of divalent metal ion concentrations--up to 50 mM (see Discussion). Much of the data presented rely on single-point kinetic measurements because we were at first mainly interested in relative rates of DNA cleavage by several restriction enzymes under comparable conditions (see Materials and Methods). Some enzymes were subsequently studied in greater detail with respect to the effect of Ca2+ on the rate of the Mg2+- and Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage. Two enzymes were analyzed in detailed steady-state (BamHI and EcoRI) and one enzyme in singleturnover kinetic experiments (EcoRI). The data presented here allow us to put forward a coherent explanation for the number of divalent metal ions involved in DNA cleavage by restriction endonucleases of the EcoRI family. The Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence of DNA cleavage by selected restriction endonucleases With only few exceptions thus far, namely, BfiI29 and PabI,30 all type II restriction endonucleases require Mg2+ for DNA cleavage.

This was done to minimize the effects of nonspecific shielding of DNA binding by the added MgCl2 or MnCl2 on the Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence of DNA cleavage, as we were mainly concerned with the catalytic role of these ions. Figure 1 shows the Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence of the DNA cleavage reaction by the nine enzymes. Qualitatively, most of the enzymes have similar Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence profiles. Apart from BamHI and BglII, the Mg2+ concentration optimum occurs at an  10-fold higher concentration (on average between 1 and 10 mM) than the Mn2+ concentration optimum (on average between 0.1 and 1 mM) (Table 2), as has been observed before for some restriction enzymes (e.g., EcoRV).36 In all cases except BamHI, the maximal DNA cleavage rate in the presence of Mn2+ is lower than the Mg2+-dependent DNA cleavage at optimum conditions. In the majority of cases, the enzymes tested are inhibited by Mg2+ concentrations of above  10 mM and by

the PD...D/EXK family, Mg2+ can be substituted by other divalent cations that support catalysis (in particular Mn2+), but not by Ca2+ (reviewed by Pingoud and Jeltsch6). Interestingly, for KpnI, a member of the HNH family, and for Cfr42I, a member of the GIYYIG family, Ca2+ can replace Mg2+ as the catalytic cofactor.31­34 We determined the Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentration dependence of DNA cleavage by restriction endonucleases to improve our understanding of the mechanism of DNA cleavage. We investigated nine different restriction enzymes of the EcoRI family: BamHI, BglII, Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII-C (catalytic domain = EcoRII-C), MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII. Structural information is available (Table 1) for seven of these enzymes (BamHI, BglII, Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII, NgoMIV, and PspGI), five of which were determined as co-crystal structures in the presence of DNA (BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, NgoMIV, and PspGI). The structure of SsoII presumably is identical with that of its close relative Ecl18kI.35 We determined the Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence of DNA cleavage at a constant (physiological) ionic strength of 160 mM [I = (1/2)cizi2,

DNA cleavage experiments were carried out at 37 °C at a constant ionic strength (160 mM, adjusted with NaCl) with radioactively labeled PCR-amplified DNA substrates having one recognition site. The relative cleavage rates at the Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentrations indicated are represented in black or blue, respectively. The highest cleavage rate measured for each enzyme was set to 100%. Experimental conditions for the Mg2+ concentration dependence (Mn2+ concentration dependence) were as follows: BamHI, 0.33 nM (0.33 nM); DNA, 100 nM (100 nM); incubation time, 30 min (30 min). BglII, 0.025 nM (0.05 nM); DNA, 27 nM (27 nM); incubation time, 30 min (30 min). Cfr10I, 5 nM (25 nM); DNA, 110 nM (100 nM); incubation time, 30 min (45 min).

Mn2+ concentrations exceeding  1 mM. For SsoII, the optimum Mg2+ concentration could not be determined within the Mg2+ concentration range investigated, and thus inhibition could not be measured for this enzyme. Mn2+ concentration optima could be determined for all enzymes except BglII. Following the principle of parsimony, we assume that stimulation and inhibition of DNA cleavage are due to the binding of divalent metal ions at two different metal ion binding sites (one essential and the other one dispensable, but if occupied modulatory) and draw the following tentative conclusions: The apparent affinity of the nine restriction endonucleases (when in complex with their DNA substrate) for Mg2+, as estimated on the basis of the cleavage activity versus concentration profiles, is in the millimolar range for the "catalytic" site (SsoII is an exception), with the modulatory site having, in general, an  10 times lower apparent affinity for Mg2+ than the catalytic site. With the exception of BamHI and BglII, the apparent affinity for Mn2+ is higher than that for Mg2+. The catalytic site (site A), in general, is estimated to have a 10-fold higher apparent affinity for Mn2+ than the modulatory site (site B). These results suggest that Mg2+ and Mn2+ binding to the nine restriction endonucleases studied here is more complex than previously assumed: Mg2+ and Mn 2+ are not just essential cofactors for DNA cleavage but, at higher concentrations, can also inhibit the reaction, at least under the conditions of the experiments shown in Fig. 1 (i.e., at non-saturating concentration of substrate). It must be emphasized that the inhibition of enzyme activity at higher Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentration has been reported for many enzymes acting on nucleic acids, but it was not clarified whether this was a specific Mg2+ or Mn2+ effect or a general ionic strength effect. The effect of Ca2+ on the Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage by selected restriction endonucleases Several co-crystal structures of restriction endonucleases in complex with DNA were determined in the presence of Ca2+ as an analogue of Mg2+.25 It was shown, however, in a study by Vipond et al.37 that the Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage by EcoRV could be stimulated by Ca2+. We have now analyzed the effect of Ca2+ on the Mg2+-dependent and (in some

cases) Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage by BamHI, EcoRI, MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII. Experiments were carried out at concentrations of Mg2+ or Mn2+ that were below, around, or above the optimum Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentrations while keeping the ionic strength constant by adjusting the NaCl concentration in the cleavage buffer. The results of our DNA cleavage experiments show that, in general, Mg2+- and Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage by these enzymes can be stimulated by Ca2+ in the metal-ion concentration range tested. Whereas the Ca2+ effects are qualitatively similar, quantitative variations were observed for the different enzymes. A very pronounced Ca2+ effect was observed with BamHI (Fig. 2), which can be stimulated by a factor of up to  50 at 0.5 mM Mg2+ (Fig. 2, top). The stimulation is observed at Ca 2+ concentrations

above  10 mM, meaning that the BamHI­DNA complex must have a Ca 2+ binding site with N 10 mM affinity (assuming the observed effects are due to binding to two sites in the active centres of these enzymes). It is noteworthy that the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ is also observed at Mg2+ concentrations above the Mg2+ concentration optimum (Fig. 2, bottom). The stimulatory effect of Ca 2+ on the Mg2+ dependent DNA cleavage by EcoRI (Fig. 3a) is comparatively small. Whereas Ca2+ stimulates cleavage at suboptimal Mg2+ concentrations (0.5 mM) only slightly (Fig. 3a, top), it has a pronounced stimulatory effect at high Mg 2+ concentrations (15 mM) (Fig. 3a, bottom). Stimulation is also seen for the Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage by EcoRI (Fig. 3b) wherein addition of Ca2+ at N10 mM concentrations results in an 2-fold increase in cleavage at 0.02 mM Mn2+ (Fig. 3b, top). These results suggest that in the presence of DNA substrate, EcoRI has a Ca2+ binding site with N 10 mM affinity. This stimulation is not seen at 0.1 mM Mn2+ (Fig. 3b, bottom), presumably reflecting the higher affinity of Mn2+ (compared with that of Ca2+) for the second site. Figure 3c shows the result of experiments in which EcoRI and DNA were preincubated in the absence or presence of 25 mM Ca2+, followed by addition of Mg2+ in different concentrations. The plot shows the difference in cleavage, clearly demonstrating the stimulating effect of Ca2+ (up to 5-fold comparing the

rates of cleavage at 1 and 25 mM Mg2+ at this Ca2+ concentration). The Ca2+ effects on the Mg2+-dependent DNA cleavage by MboI (Fig. 4) can be summarized as

146 follows: a 4-fold stimulation at suboptimal Mg2+ concentrations (0.5 mM) (Fig. 4, top) and a 2-fold stimulation at Mg2+ concentrations (15 mM) above the Mg2+ concentration optimum (Fig. 4, bottom). These effects become apparent at Ca2+ concentrations above  10 mM, arguing for a Ca2+ binding site with N 10 mM affinity. The Ca2+ effects on the Mn2+dependent DNA cleavage by MboI are similar to those observed for EcoRI (data not shown). The Ca2+ effects on the Mg2+ -dependent DNA cleavage by NgoMIV are more pronounced (Fig. 5a), with a 17- to 160-fold stimulation at suboptimal Mg2+ concentrations of 1.5 and 0.5 mM, respectively, and a slight stimulation at Mg2+ concentrations (15 mM) above the Mg2+ concentration optimum. Pronounced Ca2+ effects are also seen with NgoMIV in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5b). Depending on the Mn2+ concentration, different Ca2+ effects are observed: strong (N 10-fold) stimulation at suboptimal Mn 2+ concentrations (0.02 mM), weak (1.5-fold) stimulation at optimal Mn2+ concentration (0.1 mM), and no effect at Mn2+ concentrations (0.6 mM) above the Mn2+ concentration optimum. The stimulation at suboptimal Mn2+ concentration is observed at Ca2+ concentrations N 10 mM, arguing for a Ca2+ binding site with N 10 mM affinity in the presence of the DNA substrate. It is interesting to note that in the presence of 0.02 mM Mn2+, 50 mM Ca2+ (i.e., a 2500-fold excess

Me2+ Ion-Dependence of Restriction Enzymes

of Ca2+ over Mn2+) stimulates cleavage activity, whereas by increasing the Mn2+ concentration to 0.6 mM (i.e., an 80-fold excess of Ca2+ over Mn2+), hardly any cleavage activity is observed. This likely reflects competition for a common divalent metalion binding site that is only occupied by excess Ca2+ at low concentration of Mn2+. Ca2+ stimulates, by a factor of 2 and 1.3, respectively, the Mg2+-dependent DNA cleavage by PspGI (Fig. 6) below and at the Mg2+ optimum. Such measurements above the Mg2+ concentration optimum could not be made while maintaining the constant ionic strength (160 mM) used in the study. The stimulatory effects are observed at Ca 2+ concentrations N 10 mM, arguing for a Ca2+ binding site with N10 mM affinity. SsoII is related to PspGI38 and has an even higher Mg2+ concentration optimum. In the presence of 1.5 mM Mg2+, a concentration that does not support DNA cleavage, there is no stimulation of activity with up to 50 mM Ca2+. At a concentration of 15 mM Mg2+, however, a 6-fold stimulation by Ca2+ is observed (Fig. 7a). Similarly, in the presence of 0.6 mM Mn2+, no Ca2+ stimulation is observed (Fig. 7b), while at higher Mn2+ concentrations (2.5 and 15 mM), Ca2+ stimulates DNA cleavage (2- and 1.2-fold, respectively). These effects are apparent at Ca2+ concentrations N 10 mM, arguing for a Ca2+ binding site with N 10 mM affinity.

147 The stimulation of the Mg2+ -dependent DNA cleavage activity of BamHI, EcoRI, MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII by Ca2+ at various concentrations of Mg2+ is summarized in Table 3. It is important to note that the degree of stimulation is dependent on the reference rate at the optimum Mg2+ concentration for the enzyme in question, which in turn is only valid for the concentrations of enzyme and substrate given and the experimental conditions used. Michaelis­Menten analysis of DNA cleavage by BamHI and EcoRI at various concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ The experiments shown in Figs. 1 to 8 were not done under Michaelis­Menten conditions. The cleavage rates could therefore be affected to a variable degree (depending on the enzyme) by product inhibition, enzyme inactivation, etc., and cannot be quantitatively described by effects on Km and/or kcat. To determine whether the inhibition of DNA cleavage at high concentrations of Mg2+ and the stimulation by Ca2+ are due to differences in Km and/or kcat, we have carried out Michaelis­ Menten kinetics for BamHI and EcoRI at 7.5 mM (Fig. 8), 15 mM, and 50 mM Mg2+ and at 15 mM

The stimulation is calculated by dividing the cleavage rates obtained with and without Ca2+.

Mg2+ + 35 mM Ca2+, respectively. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 4. For both BamHI and EcoRI, the Km value increases with increasing Mg2+ concentration (from 7.5 to 50 mM) by approximately a factor of 3, whereas the kcat value remains almost unaltered. The addition of 35 mM Ca2+ to the reaction mixture containing 15 mM Mg2+ leads to a decrease in the Km value by approximately a factor of 2 and a slight increase in the kcat value, resulting in a larger kcat/ Km value compared to that obtained at the same concentration of Mg2+ but in the absence of Ca2+. The comparison between the results obtained at 15 mM Mg2+ + 35 mM Ca2+ and 50 mM Mg2+ (i.e., at the same Me2+ concentration) is even more im-

pressive: an approximately 5- to 6-fold increase in Km but only a slight increase in kcat resulting in a 5- to 10-fold increase in kcat/Km, when 50 mM Mg2+ is replaced by 15 mM Mg2+ + 35 mM Ca2+. Single-turnover kinetics of DNA cleavage by EcoRI The steady-state DNA cleavage experiments described above attribute the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ to Km (i.e., to specific substrate binding). However, kcat values of restriction enzymes may be limited by product release, which might obscure the effects of metal ions on the DNA cleavage rate. Therefore, we carried out DNA cleavage experiments under single-turnover conditions. For this purpose, an excess of enzyme (40, 100, and 200 nM) over substrate (20 nM) was chosen to give a 2-fold, 5-fold, and 10-fold excess, respectively. Since the experiments were done with sampling by hand, higher concentrations could not be chosen. Figure 9 shows the single-turnover kinetics of DNA cleavage by EcoRI. Experiments were done at 0°C (to slow the reaction) in the presence of 15 mM MgCl2, 15 mM MgCl2 + 35 mM CaCl2, or 50 mM MgCl2, respectively. With 40 and 100 nM EcoRI, DNA cleavage at 15 mM MgCl2 is faster than at 50 mM MgCl2, but as fast as in the presence of 15 mM MgCl2 + 35 mM CaCl2. With 200 nM EcoRI, however, DNA cleavage proceeds with similar rates regardless of the cofactor mixture. We attribute the slight increase in the single-turnover rate observed with increasing EcoRI concentrations to the dimer/tetramer equilibrium of EcoRI.39 The results of the single-turnover experiments indicate that the stimulation of DNA cleavage by Ca2+ in the case of EcoRI is due to a stimulation of substrate binding: at 0 °C, 40 and 100 nM EcoRI are not enough to bind 20 nM DNA completely in the presence of 50 mM MgCl2, whereas in the presence of 15 mM MgCl2 + 35 mM CaCl2 [i.e., at an equivalent Me2+ concentration (50 mM)], substrate binding is complete. Molecular dynamics simulations of the divalent metal-ion sites in BamHI Mg2+ binding to the BamHI­DNA complex has previously been analyzed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.40,41 In light of our experimental findings, we extended this analysis to investigate the binding of Ca2+ in the absence or presence of Mg2+.

The free energies of moving Mg2+ and Ca2+ from their active-site positions in BamHI to bulk solution

are shown in Table 5. These data reflect the binding energies of the metal ions in site A (the catalytic site) and site B (the modulatory site) in the pentavalent intermediate state, where site A is on the nucleophile "entering" side that contributes to generating the attacking nucleophile, and site B is on the "leaving" group side, the role of which has not been unequivocally elucidated. The Gbind values unambiguously indicate that both Mg2+ and Ca2+ bind more strongly to site A than to site B. This observation suggests that the contribution of metal ion A to the stabilization of the pentavalent intermediate is considerably larger than that of metal ion B. This also argues that it is the more loosely bound metal ion B that will be replaced first upon addition of Ca2+. Surprisingly, the presence of a Ca2+ at site B enhances the stability of Mg2+ at site A. As indicated by the relative metal-ion stabilities, Mg2+ at site A and Ca2+ at site B is the most stable configuration. In addition, the largest difference between site A and site B is observed when Mg2+ is removed from site A in the presence of Ca2+ in site B. The Gbind values also illustrate that Ca2+ is less firmly bound than Mg2+ at any site. The least stable case is when both sites are occupied by Ca2+, suggesting the smallest stabi-

Enzyme and DNA concentrations: EcoRI, 40 nM (a), 100 nM (b), and 200 nM (c); DNA, 20 nM. Reactions were started by addition of Mg2+ and Ca2+ at various concentrations: 15 mM Mg2+ (circles), 15 mM Mg2+ + 35 mM Ca2+ (triangles), 50 mM Mg2+ (squares). Experiments were carried out at 0°C and performed in duplicate [(a) only]. The pseudo-first-order rate constants determined for the cleavage of 200 nM DNA at different Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations were identical within the limits of error (1.25 ± 0.25 s-1), demonstrating that the inhibition by excess Mg2+ can be relieved by saturating DNA concentrations.

Ion movement is from positions at the active site of BamHI in the pentavalent intermediate state of the phosphodiester hydrolysis to bulk solution. Gbind values were determined by combined quantum chemical/molecular mechanical calculations by the EVB/FEP-US approach (see Materials and Methods), computed by removing the ions at the given (italic) position, while keeping the other position occupied and then subtracting the respective solvation free energies. Gbind(A­B) is the difference between the stabilities of the two metal-ion positions determined as Gbind(A) - Gbind(B).

150 lization for the pentavalent intermediate. Taken together and consistent with our experimental results, we propose a mechanism whereby Ca2+ replaces metal ion B. We predict that the energy cost of this replacement is 6.1 kcal/mol (cf. Table 5: 38.5­32.4 = 6.1 kcal/mol), a value that likely overestimates the experimental value and suggests accompanying conformational changes upon Mg2+Ca2+ substitution. Mg2+ at site A is more stable when site B is occupied by Ca2+ rather than by Mg2+, implying that Ca2+ creates a more favourable environment for the leaving group.

Me2+ Ion-Dependence of Restriction Enzymes

Discussion
Most type II restriction endonucleases are characterized by the PD...D/EXK motif, which was proposed to represent the catalytic centre and Mg2+ binding site when the structures of EcoRI and EcoRV became available.42­45 Subsequently, structures of additional restriction enzymes were determined and most of them share this motif.6,46 To date, crystal data are available for 29 restriction enzymes, all of which, except BfiI and PabI, are members of the PD...D/EXK family. Some of these structures include complexes of enzyme, DNA, and divalent metal ion(s). While the wealth of structural data available for this family of enzymes has been extremely useful for our understanding of protein­ nucleic acid interactions, it has not (yet) allowed formulating a general mechanism for phosphodiester bond hydrolysis by these enzymes. This stumbling block arises from the variable number of divalent metal ions, usually Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, seen in different enzyme­DNA complexes. A few enzymes have no divalent metal ion bound to the active centre despite the fact that divalent metal ions were present in the crystallization mix, some have one divalent metal ion per active site, and others have two (Table 1). This has led several biochemists to assume that within the family of PD...D/EXK restriction endonucleases, some enzymes follow a two-metal-ion mechanism, whereas others need only one divalent metal ion for catalysis (for reviews, see Refs. 3,5,47). Nevertheless, in a few cases, an example being HincII, one or two divalent metal ions are seen in the co-crystal structures, depending on the divalent metal ion and whether the structure solved is that of an enzyme­substrate or enzyme­product complex.48,49 In other cases, such as EcoRV, one or two divalent metal ions are seen in one subunit of the enzyme­substrate complex and none or one in the other, depending on the divalent metal ion.50 Similarly, in the BamHI­DNA complex, two Ca2+ and two Mn2+, respectively, are seen in one subunit and none in the other.19 The number and location of the divalent metal ions are different, depending not only on the divalent metal ion and the presence of amino acid substitutions but

also on the crystal lattice51 (reviewed in Ref. 6). Sometimes, where documented, the occupancy in the two divalent metal ion binding sites in crystal structures of restriction enzyme­substrate complexes varies. This was first noticed for EcoRV50 and very recently for SgrAI.23 Clearly, these crystal structure analyses demonstrate that many restriction endonucleases can bind two divalent metal ions in their catalytic centres when co-crystallized with DNA. While still relevant, we are not considering divalent metal-ion binding to apoenzymes, since we are interested in the catalytic process in which not only the enzyme but also the DNA substrate is very likely to interact with the cofactor. The question is whether both divalent metal ions are needed for catalysis. It may also be asked whether enzymes that were co-crystallized with one divalent metal ion per active site in the enzyme­DNA complex need only one divalent metal ion for DNA cleavage. As pointed out by Aggarwal and colleagues: "There has been much debate as to the catalytic mechanism of restriction endonucleases. Crystal structures of the BamHI prereactive and postreactive complexes have been solved in the presence of Ca2+ and Mn2+, respectively, and suggest a two-metal mechanism of catalysis. In contrast, in the BglII co-crystal structure, only a single octahedrally coordinated Ca2+ is seen occupying the active site. However, solution studies are still needed to confirm the structural interpretation of metal ion coordination by BamHI and BglII".52 We decided to address this problem experimentally by studying the Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence of DNA cleavage by representative type II restriction endonucleases of the EcoRI family: BamHI, BglII, Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII-C, MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII. Members of this family have been shown to have one or two divalent metal ions per active site in the co-crystal structure of the respective enzyme­DNA complex. For instance, in the co-crystal structure of the BamHI­DNA or NgoMIV­DNA complex, two divalent metal ions are seen per catalytic centre, whereas only one is seen in the structures of EcoRI and BglII (Table 1). We have determined the Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentration dependence of DNA cleavage in a concentration range from 0 to 50 mM Me2+. Although Me2+ concentrations approaching 50 mM are certainly nonphysiological, they allow analyzing the role of these metal ions in the DNA cleavage mechanism in very much the same way as the pH profile of a reaction is recorded in order to determine the presence of ratelimiting ionization states of reactive groups involved in the reaction. A constant (physiological) ionic strength of 160 mM was maintained in order to exclude as much as possible nonspecific effects of divalent metal ion binding to the DNA substrate and possibly also to the enzyme. Without such compensation, there would be increased shielding of electrostatic interactions between substrate and enzyme with increasing Me2+ concentration, obscuring the effect of the Me2+ on the catalytic process per se. It is clear that this compensation cannot account for

151 not expect to see a relief of inhibition by further addition of Ca2+ (see below), which has a similar affinity for polydeoxyribonucleotides as Mg2+.59 Although the inhibitory effects of Mg 2+ are observed at nonphysiological concentrations of Mg2+ ( 1 mM), they might help to resolve a long standing mechanistic problem. A straightforward explanation for the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of Mg2+ (or Mn2+) would be to assume that the nine restriction enzymes that we studied have two Me2+ binding sites per active centre: one highaffinity binding site (site A), where a Mg2+ or Mn2+ is required for specific binding and cleavage, and another low-affinity binding site (site B), inhibiting if occupied by Mg2+ (at non-saturating concentrations of substrate) and Mn2+ and activating if occupied by Ca2+. This would reconcile both the kinetic data shown here and the structural data published previously. A similar explanation had been put forward to explain results obtained for RNase HI55 and endonuclease V26; however, since these experiments were not done at constant ionic strength, a direct comparison of these and our results is not possible. For an enzyme that has two metal-binding sites, each with a distinct binding affinity, titration with a nonproductive metal should yield biphasic inhibition curves or stimulation of activity followed by inhibition. Previously, Halford and colleagues attempted to distinguish between one- and twometal-ion mechanisms for DNA cleavage by investigating the effect of Ca2+ on the Mg2+ - and Mn2+dependent DNA cleavage reaction of EcoRI and EcoRV. For EcoRI, both Mg2+- and Mn2+-dependent activities were shown to be inhibited by Ca2+. The activity of EcoRV with Mg2+ was also inhibited by Ca2+, but the Mn2+-dependent reaction with the EcoRV recognition site was stimulated by Ca2+.37 These observations were interpreted as EcoRI needing only one metal ion per active site and being inactivated when Mg2+ is displaced by Ca2+, whereas EcoRV needs two metal ions and that the displacement of one by Ca2+ can enhance activity. More recently, Beernink et al. showed that DNA cleavage by the human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Ape1 is inhibited by Mg2+ concentrations N 6 mM, but showed stimulation and inhibition of the Mg2+-dependent DNA cleavage depending on the Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations.28 Likewise, Cao and Lu showed that the Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage by TaqI was inhibited by excess Mn2+ yet could be stimulated by Ca2+.27 We have now carried out similar experiments for the Mg2+- and Mn2+dependent DNA cleavage by BamHI, EcoRI, MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII under conditions of constant ionic strength. Our results show that all enzymes studied can be stimulated by Ca2+ to a variable degree, depending on the enzyme and the concentrations of Mg2+ (or Mn2+) and Ca2+ . Differences in the experimental conditions used may explain why we observed a stimulatory effect of Ca2+ on the Mg2+ - and Mn2+ -dependent DNA cleavage by EcoRI under certain conditions and inhibitions at others, whereas Vipond et al. observed

specific effects due to the chemical nature of Mg2+ and Mn2+, but only for the charge when applying a continuous electrostatic model such as in the Debye­Hückel approach. This may explain why Mg2+ ions weaken DNA­protein interactions more severely than do Na+ ions at the same total ionic strength.53 Similar experiments to see differences between Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ and compared to Na+ at the same ionic strength have not been done systematically yet. The results of our experiments show that six of the nine enzymes studied here start to be inhibited by concentrations of Mg2+ or Mn2+ exceeding  10 mM Mg2+ or 0.1 to 1 mM Mn2+ , respectively. Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII-C, MboI, and NgoMIV are almost completely inhibited at Mn2+ concentrations above 1­10 mM. BamHI, BglII, and SsoII, in contrast, can tolerate Mn2+ concentrations considerably higher than 10 mM, and furthermore, SsoII is active at N 50 mM Mg2+. A similar Me2+ concentration dependence of phosphodiester bond cleavage was observed for other restriction endonucleases (e.g., EcoRV54) and other nucleases (e.g., RNase HI,55 AP endonuclease,28 and endonuclease V26). These experiments, however, were not carried out at constant ionic strength. A complex Me 2+ concentration dependence (stimulation followed by inhibition) was also observed for other enzymes, for example, cobamide-dependent ribonucleotide reductase, whose activity is regulated allosterically by nucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside triphosphate­ Mg2+ complexes56 and RNA polymerase.57 Various explanations for this behaviour of the Me2+ on the rate of the reaction were discussed, among them free metal ion and free substrate or effector binding to the enzyme. Although it cannot be excluded that the influence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ on the activities of BamHI, BglII, Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII-C, MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII that we observe is due to secondary effects on protein or DNA conformation (due to binding of Mg2+ or Mn2+ to nonspecific sites), we regard this explanation as unlikely because of the qualitatively similar effects (activation at low and inhibition at high Me2+ concentrations) that were observed for the different enzymes with either Mg2+ or Mn2+. The slopes of the rate versus log[Me2+] profiles (for both the ascending and descending arms) are close to 2 in most cases, suggesting the involvement of two Me2+ per dimer for activation and two for inhibition of the rate-limiting step of the DNA cleavage reaction. Furthermore, secondary effects due to binding of Mn2+ to the polynucleotide substrate are not expected at the relatively low concentrations of Mn2+ that lead to an almost complete inhibition in some cases (e.g., EcoRI and NgoMIV at b 1 mM). Likewise, although Mg2+ is known to exert a strong chaotropic effect on proteins, these become apparent only at very high concentrations,58 much higher than used here. Furthermore, if the inhibition at high Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentrations were arising from overloading the polynucleotide substrate with positively charged divalent metal ions, one would

152 only inhibition. For example, we observed stimulation of the Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage by EcoRI by N 10 mM Ca2+ at 0.02 mM MnCl2, but inhibition at 0.1 mM MnCl2; Vipond et al. observed inhibition at 0.5 mM MnCl2. The stimulation can be very significant under certain Mg2+ concentrations, up to 50-fold in the case of BamHI and 160-fold in the case of NgoMIV at 0.5 mM Mg2+. We interpret these results as one Mg2+ or Mn2+ likely being essential for catalysis. A second metal ion can modulate the catalytic activity, not supporting it when it is Mg2+ or Mn2+ but stimulating it when it is Ca2+. The variable magnitude of Ca2+ stimulation among the different enzymes that are reliant on the Mg2+ (or Mn2+) concentration can be explained by the relative affinities of the divalent metal ions for the two sites and

Me2+ Ion-Dependence of Restriction Enzymes

the relative rates of DNA cleavage depending on which sites are occupied. A simplified reaction scheme illustrating the reaction of a restriction enzyme with Mg 2+ and/or Ca 2+ is shown in Fig. 10a. It consists of nine different species linked by reversible reactions. In principle, all these reactions, together with the enzyme, substrate, and Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ concentrations, determine the cleavage rate observed, indicating that the experimental system is largely underdetermined and precise quantitative conclusions are difficult to draw. The Km and kcat values for DNA cleavage by BamHI and EcoRI show that increasing the Mg2+ concentration above the optimum concentration leads to an increase in Km but not to a decrease in kcat. If product release was limiting at high concen-

(a) The overall reaction scheme describing the binding of Mg2+ and Ca2+ to the enzyme is shown, where site A is superscript and site B is subscript. Only one subunit of the homodimeric enzyme is shown, which is only active in DNA cleavage (only double-strand cleavage is considered) when both subunits have at least one Mg2+ in site A (e.g., EMg). The Kd values (in millimolar) used in the simulation (b­d) are indicated. They were estimated on the basis of the divalent metal ion profiles for DNA cleavage (Figs. 2­7). Michaelis­Menten parameters used are as follows: Km (Mg) = 2 nM, Km (Mg/Ca) = 2 nM, Km (Mg/ Mg) = 100 nM, kcat = 0.03 s- 1 [the Km for the species with two Mg2+ in one subunit are assigned the Km (Mg/Mg)]. They were estimated on the basis of the steady-state results (Table 4) and considering that measured Km values are "mixed" containing contributions from Km (Mg), Km (Mg/Ca), and Km (Mg/Mg). Simulations of the Mg2+ dependence of DNA cleavage by a restriction endonuclease (black lines) and the effect of addition of Ca2+ (gray lines) at three different concentrations of Mg2+: (b) 0.5, (c) 1.5, and (d) 15 mM, using the binding constants given in the reaction scheme above. Concentrations of enzyme (E) and substrate (S): cE = 1 nM, cS = 20 nM (c and d) or 200 nM (b). The simulations shown had been selected from a series of simulations (see Materials and Methods) and describe in a qualitative manner the divalent metal ion dependence of DNA cleavage by EcoRI (Fig. 3a). The higher Km value of enzymes having two Mg2+ or Mn2+ bound per active site results in a decrease of activity at higher Mg2+ concentrations and low substrate concentrations (c) (cS = 20 nM) compared to high substrate concentrations (b) (cS = 200 nM). The stimulation by Ca2+ can only be simulated when Ca2+ in site B increases the affinity of Mg2+ for site A by a factor of 10 (compare c and d, KAMBC = 0.2 mM versus KAMBC = 2 mM, i.e., no stimulation by Ca2+ bound to site B).

Me2+ Ion-Dependence of Restriction Enzymes

153 divalent metal-ion dependence of DNA cleavage can be simulated assuming that binding of Mg2+ occurs with higher affinity than binding of Ca2+. Mg2+ binding to site A yields a productive complex, whereas Mg2+ binding to sites A and B does not support cleavage at low substrate concentration. In contrast, binding of Ca2+ to site B, when site A is occupied by Mg2+, yields a productive complex. The observed Ca2+ stimulation, however, can only be simulated when it is assumed that Ca2+ binding to site B increases the affinity of Mg2+ for site A (compare c and d in Fig. 10), in agreement with the MD calculations. Our simulations also demonstrate that the inhibitory effect observed at high concentrations of Mg 2+ can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration (compare b and c in Fig. 10). Of course, the question arises whether the results that we obtained can be extrapolated to the in vivo situation. Although the milieu interne for bacterial (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus globigii, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Moraxella bovis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella sonnei) or archaeal (Pyrococcus furiosus) hosts is likely to be different among the various organisms and certainly from the in vitro conditions that we used, it can be assumed that pH (around neutral) and ionic strength (around 160 mM) are not too different. While free intracellular Mg2+ concentrations are in the low millimolar range,61,62 meaning inhibitory concentrations will not be reached, Ca2+ concentrations are submillimolar,63 meaning stimulating concentrations will not be reached either. We do not know whether the stimulatory role of Ca2+ at the nonphysiological ion concentrations that we observed in vitro is taken over by another metal ion in vivo or--and this we consider as more likely--whether the restriction enzymes that we studied operate under physiological conditions at an optimum rate for their in vivo function and do not require extra stimulation. While it is clear that we have observed inhibition and stimulation of DNA cleavage by restriction endonucleases at nonphysiologically high concentrations of divalent metal ions, it is also clear that most of the structure analyses reported for restriction endonucleases were obtained for crystals soaked or grown at these nonphysiologically high concentrations, for example, BamHI (soaked with 20 mM MnCl219 ) or NgoMIV (co-crystallized with 67 mM MgCl222). Our results advocate that the restriction endonucleases of the EcoRI family require essentially one metal ion for their catalytic activity. For substrate binding, an "activation/attenuation" mechanism is supported in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. This term was proposed for the mechanism of RNA cleavage by RNase HI55,64 based on both the crystal structure of the RNase HI apoenzyme and biochemical data, with activation at low and inhibition at high Mn2+ concentration. It must be emphasized that this mechanism is not widely accepted, as the recent structure analyses of catalytically inactive RNase H mutants crystallized in complex with an RNA­DNA hybrid had two Mg2+ bound at the

trations of Mg 2+ , one would have expected a decrease in kcat. The stimulation by Ca2+ is mainly due to a decrease in Km and, to a smaller extent, an increase in kcat (i.e., ground and transition state stabilization). Single-turnover experiments carried out with EcoRI confirm that the Ca2+ effect is due to stabilization of the enzyme­substrate­Mg2+ complex (ground state, transition state, or both). Thus, Ca2+ binding helps to overcome the inhibitory effect of Mg2+or Mn2+ binding to site B at low substrate concentrations. The main experimental results obtained here regarding the divalent metal ion requirements of type II restriction endonucleases of the EcoRI family corroborate MD simulations published previously that suggest that the roles of the two metal ions are not equivalent in BamHI.40,41 Metal ion B, which serves to stabilize the leaving group, is bound more loosely to the phosphate at the scissile phosphodiester bond than metal ion A, implicating a smaller contribution to the stabilization of the transition state. More detailed analysis on the reaction pathway carried out in the framework of the empirical valence bond (EVB) method showed that even in their crystallographic positions, metal ion A can provide a catalytic effect that is comparable to that of the two metal ions, whereas metal ion B alone is insufficient for catalysis. Simulations suggest that BamHI can operate by a one-metal-ion mechanism, since metal ion A in BamHI is more stably bound than metal ion B, which can move away from the phosphate at the scissile phosphodiester bond and break its coordination with the O3 atom of the leaving group. These computational results do not argue against a favourable role of metal ion B for phosphodiester bond hydrolysis, but question its importance being comparable to that of metal ion A as proposed by the classic two-metal-ion mechanism. Higher-level ab initio calculations,60 however, are in conflict with these data as they assign a crucial role to metal ion B in stabilizing the pentavalent intermediate. During the reaction, metal ion B is observed to rearrange its coordination sphere from six to four to promote protonation of the leaving group. Ca2+ ions are not capable of undergoing such conformational rearrangement and rather overstabilize the pentavalent state, perhaps accounting for their inhibitory effect. The stabilization of the pentavalent intermediate by Ca2+ at position B (as compared to Mg2+) is also corroborated by the free energy data presented in this work. This observation suggests that the activity-restoring effect of Ca2+ is related to the greater stabilization for the pentavalent intermediate by the active-site configuration with Mg2+ at site A and Ca2+ at site B. We wondered whether it is possible to simulate the divalent metal ion dependence of DNA cleavage by restriction enzymes as shown in Figs. 1 to 7. For this purpose, we made reasonable but (given the complexity of the equilibria characterizing the overall reaction) simplifying assumptions for the KD values for the reactions shown in the scheme in Fig. 10a. This reaction scheme demonstrates that the

154 active site.65,66 For endonuclease V, it was found that excess Mg 2+ (or Mn 2+ ) can inhibit DNA cleavage and that Ca2+ in the presence of Mg2+ (or Mn2+) can stimulate DNA cleavage; for this enzyme, a "catalytic and regulatory two-metal-ion model" was proposed.26 The recently published crystal structure of the complex of endonuclease V with its product (a nicked DNA) showed that there is only one Mg2+ in the active site.67 Our experimental results indicate that in restriction endonucleases of the EcoRI family, the major catalytic effect for phosphodiester bond hydrolysis is provided by one Mg2+ (or Mn2+); these enzymes essentially follow a singlemetal-ion mechanism (unless the departure of the leaving group becomes limiting). In this context, it is important to note that the equivalent of metal A in the BamHI structure is the only divalent ion that has been seen in all restriction endonuclease structures and is coordinated by the two acidic residues of the PD...D/EXK motif. The observation that all restriction endonucleases studied here have a second metal-ion binding site implies that it has a function. The second site might be important to induce a catalytically competent conformation of the active-site residues. As reflected by the Km data and the free energy calculations, the second metal ion, Mg2+ (or Mn2+ ) versus Ca2+, considerably affects the affinity for the substrate. It has been proposed that the catalytic metal ion (or ions, in the case when two metal ions are considered to be involved in catalysis) moves (move) during catalysis, both for the two-Mg2+ catalysis of

phosphoryl transfer reactions in general68,69 and the two-Mg2+ catalysis of DNA cleavage by EcoRV51 and for the single-Mg2+ catalysis of DNA cleavage by BamHI, 41 as well as for the DNA repair endonuclease APE-1.70 According to MD simulations, Mg2+ bound to site A in BamHI stabilizes the nucleophile by lowering the pKa of a bound water molecule. This water is also hydrogen-bonded to Glu113 in BamHI41 [equivalent to Q95 in BglII, K113 in EcoRI, and K324 in NgoMIV (Fig. 11), having the capacity to position the water molecule by a hydrogen bond] and the phosphate located 3 to the scissile phosphodiester bond of the DNA substrate.71­73 In the course of the reaction, the Mg2+ together with the attacking nucleophile shifts towards the scissile phosphate bond to a position that is ideal to compensate the unfavourable charge accumulation in the pentavalent intermediate state. As described by Mones et al., a favourable location is approximately halfway between positions A and B in the BamHI­DNA co-crystal structure.41 In the absence of a second metal ion, leaving-group stabilization would be at the expense of a water molecule from the hydration sphere of the Mg2+. In the presence of Ca2+, the leaving-group stabilization could be done by this divalent metal ion. A formally similar explanation was given for the catalysis of the hammerhead ribozyme-mediated cleavage of an RNA substrate in the presence of La3+ and Mg2+, with Mg2+ generating the attacking nucleophile and La 3+ involved in leaving-group stabilization.74

Conclusion
Our results allow us to rationalize the puzzling finding that type II restriction enzymes with very similar catalytic centres seem to operate by two different mechanisms. These mechanisms were formulated mainly by considering the number of Ca2+, Mn2+, or Mg2+ identified in the active sites by crystal structure analyses of enzyme­substrate and enzyme­product complexes. Our observations that excess Mg2+ or Mn2+ does not enhance catalysis and that the addition of Ca2+ions can stimulate Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent DNA cleavage at low substrate concentrations (b Km) are most easily explained by assuming that two binding sites for divalent metal ions exist: a catalytic site essential for activity and a second site that is dispensable. This site can modulate the catalytic efficiency, depending on whether it is occupied by Mg2+ (Mn2+) or Ca2+ . We propose a one-metal-ion mechanism for DNA binding and cleavage with a modulatory role of the second metal that, at high concentrations, can reduce activity in the case of Mg2+ (Mn2+) (due to an increase in Km) or increase activity in the case of Ca2+ (due to an increase in affinity for Mg2+ binding to site A). As Ca2+ mostly stabilize the binding of the pentavalent transition state but do not support the cleavage of the chemical bond, the presence of two Ca2+ is inhibitory for the reaction. The affinity of the second modulatory site appears too low to be physiologically relevant and may not be populated during physiological turnover, given the intracellular concentration of Mg2+ and Ca2+. We suggest that this mechanism for DNA cleavage by the enzymes of the EcoRI family, a one-metal or two-metal mechanism, depending on the divalent metal ion and the substrate concentration, could possibly be extended to restriction endonucleases of the EcoRV family (e.g., BglI, EcoRV, HincII, MspI, MvaI, and PvuII) and other nucleases (e.g., MutH) for which crystal structures of enzyme­ substrate and enzyme­product complexes with one or two divalent metal ions were reported. Nonetheless, the divalent metal ion dependence of DNA cleavage by these enzymes needs to be verified experimentally by carrying out similar experiments as described here. Recently published single-turnover DNA cleavage data for PvuII as a function of Mg 2+ concentration indicate that for the PvuII system, catalysis involving one Mg2+ per active site can indeed occur, but that a more efficient twometal-ion mechanism can be operative under higher Mg2+ concentrations.75 It was shown in the same study that one Ca2+ or Mg2+ per active site stimulates substrate binding similarly, but that a second Ca2+ dramatically increases DNA binding affinity, while there is only a modest increase for Mg2+ (see also Bellamy et al.76). For the PvuII system, it was concluded that the "more efficient two-metal-ion mechanism can be operative under saturating metal ion (in vitro) conditions".77 We agree with Scheuring-Vanamee and Aggarwal2 who concluded when comparing the type II restriction endonucleases of the PD...D/EXK fam-

Materials and Methods
Enzymes Restriction enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas (BamHI and BglII, 10 U/l) or were purified [Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII-C (C-terminal domain), MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII] as described.14,38,78­82 All enzyme concentrations are given as dimer concentrations, although the native state of NgoMIV, Cfr10I, and EcoRI (at higher concentrations) is that of a tetramer. DNA substrates All DNA substrates contained a single restriction site for the enzyme assayed and were produced by the PCR with appropriate plasmids as templates using [32P]dATP. The substrate length varied from 188 to 325 bp, depending on the particular sequence amplified. Steady-state DNA cleavage experiments Single-point measurements of DNA cleavage by BamHI, BglII, Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII-C, MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII at different concentrations of Mg2+ and Mn2+ in the absence and presence of Ca2+ The DNA cleavage activity of BamHI, BglII, Cfr10I, EcoRI, EcoRII-C, MboI, NgoMIV, PspGI, and SsoII in the presence of different metal ions at various concentrations was assayed using 32P-labeled PCR substrates having a single restriction site. Experiments were performed in a cleavage buffer having a constant ionic strength of 160 mM [10 mM Tris­HCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0­50 mM divalent metal ions (MgCl2 or MnCl2, in the absence of CaCl2), and 0­150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5]. All buffers used were prepared right before the experiments and their pH was controlled. For the sake of comparison, all enzymes were diluted to a concentration that produced a maximum  35% cleavage of the DNA substrates under optimum Mg2+ concentrations within 30 min in general (all enzymes studied cleave their substrates to completion at higher concentrations or longer incubation times). The reaction mixtures (8 l) contained up to a 1000-fold excess of DNA over enzyme (dimer concentration). Cleavage reactions, performed at 37 °C for variable times (in general 30 min), were started by the addition of 2 l of 5× cleavage buffer and stopped by the addition of 5-l stop buffer [300 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in 30 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 25% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol]. Cleavage products were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels and quantified using the InstantImager system (Packard). Since nondenaturing conditions were employed for electrophoresis, only double-strand cuts were detected. Experiments were performed at least in duplicate. The amount of product formed within the time of incubation was used to determine relative cleavage rates.

Substrate concentration dependence of DNA cleavage by BamHI and EcoRI at different concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ The kinetics of DNA cleavage by BamHI was measured at varying concentrations of substrate by adding the appropriate amount of metal ion containing buffer (5× concentrated) to reaction mixtures containing 1.8­ 41.8 nM of 32P-labeled 206-bp PCR product. The BamHI concentration was 0.17 nM in the presence of 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 nM in the presence of 15 and 50 mM MgCl2, and 0.125 nM in the presence of 15 mM MgCl2 + 35 mM CaCl2. The cleavage experiments were performed at 37 °C in cleavage buffer of constant ionic strength at pH 7.5. DNA cleavage experiments with EcoRI were performed with reaction mixtures containing 1.7­41.7 nM of 32Plabeled 217-bp PCR product at 37 °C. The EcoRI concentrations were 0.75 nM in the presence of 7.5 mM MgCl2, 1 nM in the presence of 15 mM MgCl2, 1.5 nM in the presence of 50 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 nM in the presence of 15 mM MgCl2 + 35 mM CaCl2. For both sets of experiments (BamHI and EcoRI), 5-l samples were taken from a 70-l mixture at defined time intervals, and the reaction was stopped immediately with 5-l stop buffer [300 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in 30 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 25% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol]. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels and quantified using an InstantImager system (Packard). Experiments were performed at least in duplicate. The amount of product formed within the time of incubation was used to determine initial cleavage rates, from which Km and kcat values were calculated by a curvefitting procedure. Single-turnover cleavage kinetics with EcoRI at various concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ Single-turnover cleavage kinetics were performed with 40, 100, and 200 nM EcoRI and 20 nM 32P-labeled DNA substrate (217 bp) using cleavage buffer with a constant ionic strength of 160 mM. First, enzyme and DNA were mixed in the absence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ and then cleavage reactions were initiated by adding 5× cleavage buffer, containing different concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ as indicated in the figure legends, to the DNA/enzyme mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated at 0 °C, 10-l aliquots were taken at the times indicated, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5-l stop buffer. Cleavage products were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed using an InstantImager system. Metal binding free energies The stability of the metal ion sites was assessed by computing the binding free energies of the Mg2+ and Ca2+ at the pentavalent intermediate state at the active site of BamHI at positions A and B.19 The respective geometries were obtained by simulating the phosphodiester hydrolysis reaction in the presence of Mg2+ using the EVB method in combination with free energy perturbation and umbrella sampling (EVB-FEP/US).83 Geometries of the pentavalent intermediate with Ca2+ were generated from the corresponding Mg2+ structure by performing a 10-ps MD calculation at 300 K using a 0.5-fs time step, applying a 5 kcal/mol Å2 harmonic constraint on the positions of

Me2+ Ion-Dependence of Restriction Enzymes

the protein atoms and the metal ions to their initial coordinates. Binding free energies (Gbind) were determined upon removing the metal ions from their respective positions using an FEP technique, while the other metalion position remained occupied. The van der Waals parameters of the Ca2+ were taken from Ref. 84, whereas for Mg2+ modified parameters were used.85 The FEP calculation was carried out in 50 windows, each containing a 2.5-ps MD run applying 5 kcal/mol Å2 restraining potential on all protein atoms. All simulations were performed using the Q program in a solvation sphere with a 30-Å radius.86 The free energies of moving Mg2+ and Ca2+ from their protein site to bulk solution were obtained by subtracting the experimental solvation free energies (455.5 kcal/mol for Mg2+ and 380.8 kcal/mol for Ca2+) of the respective metal ions from the computed binding free energies. Simulation of the divalent metal ion dependence of homodimeric restriction endonucleases A minimal scheme for the binding of Mg2+ and Ca2+ to the two subunits of a homodimeric restriction enzyme with two sites (A and B) per subunit for Mg2+ and Ca2+ binding was established (Fig. 10). It consists of 9 different species per subunit, which differ in binding of Mg2+ and Ca2+ to the two sites, and 12 equilibria (governed by 12 Kd values). It was assumed that the two subunits bind Mg2+ and Ca2+ independently but cooperate in double-strand cleavage. The steady-state distribution of these species was simulated by COPASI87 with different sets of Kd values. The concentrations of dimer complexes (81 complexes) were calculated according to a statistical distribution of the various complexes. Only dimers that had at least one Mg2+ in site A in each subunit (nine dimers) were considered productive. Assuming that only the enzyme­metal complex will lead to catalytically active complexes (i.e., no metal binding to an enzyme­DNA complex), the steady-state concentrations of these complexes determine the rates of DNA cleavage according to Michaelis­Menten kinetics for each enzyme­metal complex (with their respective kcat and Km values). The intramolecular movement of one Mg2+ or Ca2+ bound to site A or B to the other site was not explicitly included in the simulation. The simulation was carried out for low and high substrate concentrations, wherein enzymes having two Mg2+ or Mn2+ bound per active site are inactive (at low substrate concentration) or active (at high substrate concentration). More details are given in the legend to Fig. 10 and in Supplementary Data.
