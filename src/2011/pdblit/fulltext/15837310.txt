Abstract--4-Aryl-5-pyrimidyl-based cytokine synthesis inhibitors of TNF-a production, which contain a novel bicyclic pyrazole heterocyclic core, are described. Many of these inhibitors showed low nanomolar activity against LPS-induced TNF-a production in a THP-1 cell-based assay and against human p38a MAP kinase in an isolated enzyme assay. The X-ray crystal structure of a bicyclic pyrazole inhibitor co-crystallized with mutated p38 (mp38) is presented. Ó 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine produced in response to immunostimulants primarily by activated monocytes/macrophages to help clear infections and damaged cells from injured tissues. However, the overexpression of TNF-a has been implicated in a number of serious inflammatory disorders1 such as rheumatoid arthritis,2 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),3 osteoarthritis,4 and CrohnÕs disease. Furthermore, TNF-a is a potent inducer of other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8.5 Accordingly, agents that inhibit TNF-a production can diminish the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines resulting in a reduction of inflammation and prevention of further tissue destruction. Our research strategy involves designing kinase inhibitors that will result in the inhibition of TNF-a formation. There are multiple points at which one may effectively inhibit TNF-a synthesis since several MAP kinases exist in the signaling cascade. With this in mind, our primary assay entails screening analogs for inhibition of TNF-a production in LPS-stimulated human monocytic cells (THP-1). Although we are interested

in the efficacy of our inhibitors against the overall cascade that leads to TNF-a formation, inhibition of p38 kinase may be one possible pathway through which the intended cellular effect is being demonstrated. Various p38 inhibitors have been reported containing a common 4-aryl-5-pyridinyl (or 5-pyridyl)-based motif fused to a five or six-membered heterocyclic core,6 such as SB2035807 (Fig. 1), which represents a prototypical pyridyl imidazole-based inhibitor. In a previous paper, we have reported the development of a class of cytokine inhibitors, which contains a vicinal bis-aryl five-membered heterocyclic core (Fig. 2).8 In our continued effort towards the development of disease modifying treatments for osteoarthritis, we began to

investigate other vicinal bis-aryl five-membered heterocycles as potential TNF-a inhibitors and these efforts led to the development of a new structural class of cytokine inhibitors, which contain a novel bicyclic pyrazole core. Herein we wish to report the synthesis and structure­activity relationships for this developing series. 2. Chemistry Based upon the success of the triazole series (Fig. 2), we began to explore similar heterocycles as potential TNFa inhibitors such as the pyrazolone series. The unsubstituted parent pyrazolone 7 was synthesized in four steps from commercially available starting materials. Aldol reaction of methyl 4-fluorophenylacetate (2, Scheme 1) with 4-pyridine-carboxaldehyde (3) or 2-methylsulfanyl-pyrimidine-4-carbaldehyde (4) using LDA gives bhydroxyester products 5a­b. Alcohols 5a­b are oxidized with chromium trioxide/pyridine to provide b-ketoesters 6a­b containing the desired 4-fluorophenyl and either pyridyl or pyrimidyl functionality. The pyrazolone core is installed through a thermal cyclization reaction between b-ketoesters 6a­b and semicarbazide hydrochloride (EtOH, 78 °C) to give 1,2-dihydropyrazolones 7 and 8. We envisioned further functionalization of 7 via alkylation with dihaloalkanes to provide bicyclic pyrazolone 9. However, alkylation of the 1,2-dihydropyrazolone 7 with 1,3-dibromopropane in the presence of NaH gives bicyclic pyrazole 10a (Scheme 2) instead of the anticipated bicyclic pyrazolone 9.9 Alkylation of the 1,2-dihydropyrazolone 8 with either 1,2-dibromopropane or 1,2-dibromoethane in the presence of NaH gives 10b­c as either a [5,6]- or [5,5]-bicyclic pyrazole, respectively. The 2-substituted pyrimidyl bicyclic pyrazole series provides an added benefit of a second site for functionalization. Oxidation of the thiomethylether group in 10b­c to the corresponding sulfoxide 11 is performed using mCPBA in CHCl3. Finally, displacement of sulfoxide 11 with either amines (R1NH2, toluene, 120 °C) or phenol (ArOH, NaH, THF) gives the corresponding amino- and phenoxy-bicyclic pyrazoles. 3.

both TNF-a synthesis and human p38 MAP kinase as the unsubstituted parent pyrazolone 7. In the pyrimidyl series, the [5,5]-bicyclic pyrazole inhibitor 12b proved to be a more potent inhibitor of both TNF-a production and human p38 MAP kinase than its [5,6]-bicyclic pyrazole counterpart 12a. The X-ray crystal structure14 of bicyclic pyrazole 12b co-crystallized with mutated p38 (mp38) is shown in Figure 3. The mutated p38a herein described is a double mutant (S180A, Y182F) of murine p38a.17 The phenoxy-substituted inhibitor 12b orients itself in the mp38 enzyme such that the 4-fluorophenyl ring lies in the hydrophobic (specificity) pocket (Thr106). The inhibitor has a direct interaction between the oxygen of the pyrazole ring and Lys53 as well as an interaction between the nitrogen of the pyrimidine ring and the Met109 N­H. However, the oxygen of the phenoxy-substituent suffers from a possible repulsive interaction with the carbonyl of Met109. Various amine analogs were then synthesized in the hope of obtaining a more favorable interaction between the amine substituent and the carbonyl of the Met109 residue. However, sulfoxide displacement with a benzylamine (12c) resulted in a less potent inhibitor. Smaller alkyl amines such as 2-methoxypropyl amine (12d) resulted in a modest improvement in potency against TNF-a production. Bicyclic pyrazole 12e containing a

sec-butylamine substitution on the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring demonstrated a pronounced improvement in potency against TNF-a formation (IC50 = 0.08 lM) as compared to the other analogs in this series. Presumably, the improvement in activity seen with 12e is due to the amine providing an additional interaction with the carbonyl of Met109 as compared to 12b. Additionally, bicyclic pyrazoles 12d and 12e proved to be as effective as the initial pyrazolone lead 7 against human p38 MAP kinase. The discrepancies between the human p38 MAP kinase data and the TNF-a inhibition data suggest that the bicyclic pyrazole series is possibly inhibiting TNF-a production via multiple mechanisms. Recent literature reports18 have described known p38 inhibitors to be even more effective at inhibiting the RICK (Rip-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis-regulatory protein [CLARP] kinase/Rip2/CARDIAK) kinase, which is a signal transducer of inflammatory responses. In conclusion, we have reported the synthesis of a series of novel bicyclic pyrazole inhibitors of TNF-a synthesis. Beginning from a modestly active lead 10a, we have identified bicyclic pyrazole 12e (IC50 = 0.08 lM) as a potent inhibitor of TNF-a formation in an in vitro assay against LPS-stimulated production of TNF-a. We hope to report further progress in developing this series of bicyclic pyrazoles in the near future.

The compounds were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit TNF-a production in human monocytic cells (THP-1) stimulated by LPS. Duplicate cultures of human monocytic (THP-1)11 cells (2.0 · 105/well) were incubated for 15 min in the presence of inhibitor at concentrations of 10,000, 2000, 400, and 80 nM before the stimulation of cytokine release by the addition of lipopolysaccharide (final LPS concentration, 1 lg/mL). The amount of TNF-a released was measured 4 h later using an ELISA assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and the viability of the cells was measured using an MTS assay12 (Promega Co., Madison, WI) following the 4 h incubation period. No inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity was observed during this assay.

Protein expression and purification were carried out as previously described for the murine enzyme.15 For crystallization, mutated p38a was incubated overnight (12­16 h) with 1 mM compound.
