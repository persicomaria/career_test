The NADP-dependent non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans (abbreviated Sm-ALDH) belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family. Its catalytic mechanism proceeds via two steps, acylation and deacylation. Its high catalytic ef®ciency at neutral pH implies prerequisites relative to the chemical mechanism. First, the catalytic Cys284 should be accessible and in a thiolate form at physiological pH to attack ef®ciently the aldehydic group of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Second, the hydride transfer from the hemithioacetal intermediate toward the nicotinamide ring of NADP should be ef®cient. Third, the nucleophilic character of the water molecule involved in the deacylation should be strongly increased. Moreover, the different complexes formed during the catalytic process should be stabilised. The crystal structures presented here (an apoenzyme named Apo2 with two sulphate ions bound to the catalytic site, the C284S mutant holoenzyme and the ternary complex composed of the C284S holoenzyme and G3P) together with biochemical results and previously published apo and holo crystal structures (named Apo1 and Holo1, respectively) contribute to the understanding of the ALDH catalytic mechanism. Comparison of Apo1 and Holo1 crystal structures shows a Cys284 side-chain rotation of 110  , upon cofactor binding, which is probably responsible for its pKa decrease. In the Apo2 structure, an oxygen atom of a sulphate anion interacts by hydrogen bonds with the NH2 group of a conserved asparagine residue (Asn154 in Sm-ALDH) and the Cys284 NH group. In the ternary complex, the oxygen atom of the aldehydic carbonyl group of the substrate interacts with the Ser284 NH group and the Asn154 NH2 group. A substrate isotope effect on acylation is observed for both the wild-type and the N154A and N154T mutants. The rate of the acylation step strongly decreases for the mutants and becomes limiting. All these results suggest the involvement of Asn154 in an oxyanion hole in order to stabilise the tetrahedral intermediate and likely the other intermediates of the reaction. In the ternary complex, the cofactor conformation is shifted in comparison with its conformation in the C284S holoenzyme structure, likely resulting from its peculiar binding mode to the Rossmann fold (i.e. non-perpendicular to the plane of the b-sheet). This change is likely favoured by a characteristic loop of the Rossmann fold, longer in ALDHs than in other dehydrogenases, whose orientation could be constrained by a conserved proline residue. In the ternary and C284S holenzyme structures, as well as in the Apo2 structure, the Glu250 Ê Ê side-chain is situated less than 4 A from Cys284 or Ser284 instead of 7 A in the crystal structure of the wild-type holoenzyme. It is now positioned

Introduction
Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) belong to a family of enzymes that oxidise aldehydes into their carboxylic acids in the presence of NAD(P). For example, they participate in ethanol metabolism by conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid (Steinmetz et al., 1997), or in the cellular differentiation as they produce retinoic acid by retinal oxidation (Moore et al., 1998). In Streptococcus mutans, an ALDH (Sm-ALDH) catalyses NADPH production during the irreversible oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) into 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) (Boyd et al., 1995). Also found in photosynthetic organisms, this enzyme is de®ned as an NADP-dependent non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) on the basis of its reaction. In spite of its name, this 200 kDa enzyme has to be classi®ed in the ALDH family, as it does not possess sequence identity with the other phophorylating GAPDHs for which the molecular mass is 145 kDa. In ALDHs, the catalytic reaction occurs in two steps. Firstly, the acylation step occurs via the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine residue on the substrate (Cys284 in Sm-ALDH), leading to formation of the hemithioacetal intermediate next to the hydride transfer and the thioacylenzyme and NAD(P)H. Secondly, the deacylation step involves a water molecule. To be ef®cient, these acylation and deacylation steps require cysteine and water molecule activations at physiological pH as well as stabilisation of the different intermediates of the reaction. Concerning the cysteine activation, it was proposed that a conserved glutamate residue (Glu250 in Sm-ALDH) might act as the general base. Its putative role might be to activate a water molecule observed in the ALDH2 holoenzyme structure (Steinmetz et al., 1997). This water molecule might then deprotonate the cysteine residue to form the thiolate ion (Steinmetz et al., 1997). However, the thiolate formation might be due to the proximity of the main-chain NH groups on both sides of the catalytic cysteine residue (i.e. the peptide nitrogen atoms of Cys284 and Thr285 in Sm-ALDH) (Steinmetz et al., 1997) and/or to the positive charge of the NAD(P) nicotinamide ring (Steinmetz et al., 1997; Johansson et al., 1998) thus decreasing the cysteine pKa. Recently, it was proposed that Cys284 activation is accompanied by a slight conformational change during cofactor binding (Marchal & Branlant, 1999). A careful investigation

of the comparison of the previously solved SmALDH apo and holo enzyme structure catalytic sites (Cobessi et al., 1999) (named Apo1 and Holo1) shows that a Cys284 side-chain rotation accompanies cofactor binding. In the deacylation, the thioacylenzyme undergoes nucleophilic attack by a water molecule likely positioned and/or activated by its protein environment. Recently, it was proposed that Glu250 in Sm-ALDH could be the residue involved (Marchal et al., 2000). Movements of the reduced cofactor are also postulated to be necessary to position the water molecule between the cysteine and the glutamate residues (Moore et al., 1998). In the SmALDH Apo1 and Holo1 structures (Cobessi et al., 1999), the Glu250 carboxylate group is situated Ê approximately 7 A from the Cys284 sulphur atom, as observed in the other ALDH structures. The present analyses of the catalytic sites of the Apo1, Holo1, Apo2 and ternary complex structures of Sm-ALDH in relation with the biochemical results (Marchal & Branlant, 1999; Marchal et al., 2000) suggest a catalytic mechanism in which Glu250 has no role in the acylation. The data presented here highlight the role of an oxyanion hole in the stabilisation of the tetrahedral intermediate and likely of the other intermediates of the reaction. We compare the Rossmann fold of the ALDHs and other dehydrogenases in order to understand the structural determinants of the new NAD(P) binding mode in ALDHs, which seem important for an ef®cient catalytic reaction.

Results and Discussion
The Apo2 enzyme structure Apo2 crystals were obtained under the same crystallisation conditions as those used for Apo1 Ê and Holo1. The structure was solved at 2.5 A resolution (see Materials and Methods) and revealed a fold similar to the two other reported Sm-ALDH structures (Cobessi et al., 1999) (rms between Apo1 Ê and Apo2 tetramers, 0.51 A). The major difference concerns the position of a few side-chains in the catalytic site, most notably Glu250. In the catalytic site of Apo2, the side-chain orientation of Cys284 remains the same as in Apo1, while the Glu250 side-chain orientation is modiÊ ®ed. Its carboxylate group is now positioned 3.7 A from the Cys284 sulphur atom (Figure 1) instead of Ê 7 A. This shift results from the Glu250 side-chain rotation around its w1 angle (the omit map does not present any alternative conformation, data not

shown). Therefore, the interaction between the Glu250 carboxylate group and the Arg437 guanidinium group mentioned in the Apo1 structure (Cobessi et al., 1999) is lost. No water molecule is observed between Glu250 and Cys284. Another difference is the presence of two sulphate ions in the Apo2 structure instead of one in the catalytic site of Apo1 (Figure 1). Their mean temperature Ê Ê factor is 25.5 A2 (B overall, 10.0 A2) and these anions are clearly de®ned in the electron density. The ®rst anion (SO4a) observed in Apo2 corresponds to that observed in the Apo1 and Holo1 structures. In Apo2, this anion is present in all monomers with an occupancy of 0.5. It interacts through hydrogen bonds with the Arg103 and Arg283 guanidinium groups, and the Arg437 and Gly438 NH groups. The crystallographic occupancy of the second sulphate ion (SO4b) is different (1 or 0.5) depending on the monomer. Its stabilisation is ensured by the orientation of the Arg437 side-chain, which does not interact with Glu250 anymore, and by the Arg283 side-chain. SO4b is also in interaction with the Asn154 amide group, the Thr285 and Cys284 NH groups, and the Thr285 hydroxyl group. The Glu250 side-chain is situated in a hydrophobic environment, close to SO4b. Its carboxylate Ê group is situated 3.7 A from the Cys284 thiolate group. The Glu250 carboxylate group is surrounded by several hydrophobic groups, such as the Thr285, Thr229, Leu159 and the Leu405 methyl groups, and the Phe444 aromatic ring. In such an environment, the Glu250 pKa is probably shifted toward a basic value such as that of 7.6 titrated by Marchal & Branlant (1999) and Marchal et al. (2000). It is likely protonated and interacts with SO4b by hydrogen bonds (no other hydrogen bond is observed with surrounding residues). As the distance between Glu250 and Cys284 cannot be related to the crystallisation conditions, which are identical for Apo1 and Apo2, the rotation of the Glu250 side-chain could be related to the binding of the second sulphate ion, SO4b. Both observed sulphate anions could mimic the substrate (G3P)

binding in the catalytic site. SO4a could correspond to the C3 phosphate group of G3P. Taking into account the sulphate spatial geometry, one oxygen atom of SO4b looks like the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate. Among the above-mentioned interactions concerning SO4b, two must be pointed out: the conserved Asn154 amide group and the Cys284 NH group that interact with the same SO4b oxygen atom. Their important role was already postulated on the basis of substrate binding modelling (Steinmetz et al., 1997; Johansson et al., 1998). The oxyanion hole is also similar to that in papainlike cysteine proteases, where it involves the Gln side-chain amide group and the peptide NH of the catalytic Cys (Schroder et al., 1993). At ®rst sight, the short distance between Cys284 and Glu250 observed in Apo2 suggests that Glu250 could directly deprotonate the cysteine residue without the water molecule involvement. The achievement of the carboxylic form is envisaged from the hydrophobic environment of Glu250. But, due to the fact that the pKa of 7.6 likely corresponds to Glu250 and that the acylation step is not affected when Glu250 is mutated into Ala or Gln (Marchal et al., 2000), the cysteine activation thus requires another pathway. In the Holo1 structure, the Cys284 side-chain rotation toward the catalytic site, during the cofactor binding, positions it near the Cys284 and Thr285 NH groups, as displayed in Figure 2. The orientation change of the Cys284 side-chain is very clear and unambiguous, as con®rmed by the omit map. It is likely responsible for its increased accessibility in comparison with Apo1, where the Cys284 pKa is 8.5, and for its pKa decrease. Although no hydrogen bond is observed between Cys284 and either NH284 or NH285 main chain, the crystallographic and biochemical studies imply that it is these groups, together with NADP, that cause the pKa decrease for Cys284. We note that the positively charged nicotinamide ring also in¯uences the Cys284 pKa, as it is 6.8 in the presence of NADPH instead of 6.1 when NADP is added (Marchal & Branlant, 1999).

crystallisation conditions as those used for Holo1 (data not shown). C284S ternary complex analysis As already observed in the structure of C284S holoenzyme, the electron density is mostly continuous for the cofactor ADP part, but is very poor for the nicotinamide and ribose portions, indicating conformational ¯exibility in the latter. The NADP occupancy is 0.5 and its mean temperature factor is Ê Ê 6.6 A2 (B overall, 14.6 A2). The interactions between the substrate and protein are summarised in Table 1 and Figure 3(a) shows G3P in an omit electron density map. The occupancy of G3P is 0.5 Ê (mean B value, 6.7 A2). The G3P phosphate group is notably stabilised by Arg103 and Arg283 guanidinium groups as we proposed on the basis of the Holo1 structure (Cobessi et al., 1999). The aldehyde carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate interacts with the Asn154 amide and Ser284 NH groups (Figure 3(b)) and thereby likely with the Cys284 NH group of the wild-type enzyme as the rms Ê value between their positions is small (0.27 A). This result strengthens the essential role of the conserved Asn154 in the ALDH family, which is also assumed to stabilise the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate as proposed on the basis of the Apo2 structure and modelling (Steinmetz et al., Ê 1997). The Glu250 side-chain is situated 3 A from the Ser284 hydroxyl group in a hydrophobic environment as described in Apo2. Due to substrate binding, the observed NADP conformation differs from those observed in the holo C284S and Holo1 structures (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The ternary Ê complex structure was solved at 3 A from hexagonal crystals obtained under the same crystallisation conditions as those used for C284S crystals. Therefore, only the substrate binding can be responsible for the new cofactor conformation under these crystallisation conditions. Moreover, differences are observed between the monomers in the ternary complex. Indeed, the electron densities around G3P and nicotinamide mononucleoside differ according to the monomers, suggesting slightly different conformations. The different observed NADP geometries show that cofactor movements probably occur during the catalytic reaction. They could be favoured by the small number of inter-

The C284S holoenzyme structure The overall structure of the C284S mutant holoenzyme displays no difference with Holo1 Ê (rms value between tetramers, 0.43 A). The Ser284 side-chain is directed toward the catalytic site like the side-chain of Cys284 in Holo1. Although the Ê resolution is low (3.15 A), the electron density clearly shows that the interaction between Glu250 and Arg437 is lost, and the Glu250 carboxylate Ê group is situated 3 A from the Ser284 hydroxyl group. One sulphate ion is bound to each monomer at the position where the G3P phosphate group is supposed to interact with the enzyme (Cobessi et al., 1999). It is stabilised by the Arg103 and Arg283 guanidinium groups, the Tyr155 and Thr285 hydroxyl groups, and the Arg437 NH group. Its occupancy is 0.5. The electron density around the nicotinamide mononucleoside is very poorly de®ned in comparison with the ADP part. NADP occupancy is 0.5 and its mean B value is Ê Ê 3.7 A2 (B overall, 13.1 A2). The observed disorder concurs with the cofactor ¯exibility already described in ALDHs (Moore et al., 1998; Johansson et al., 1998; Lamb & Newcomer, 1999) and with the low occupancy in the C284S structure. In the C284S mutant, the observed conformational change of the nicotinamide mononucleotide could result from the loss of the electrostatic interaction between the negative charge of the sulphydril group and the positive charge of the nicotinamide ring as Cys284 is mutated to Ser. This cofactor conformation allows the Glu250 side-chain rotation Ê and its positioning 3 A away from the Ser284 hydroxyl group. Despite the low resolution Ê (3.15 A), our interpretation of these movements is con®rmed in a second crystal form of the C284S mutant holoenzyme, obtained under the same

Note that no hydrogen bond is drawn between the cofactor and substrate as the electron density is poorly de®ned around the nicotinamide mononucleoside.

actions between the cofactor and Rossmann fold as well as by the new binding mode of the cofactor to the nucleotide-binding domain. The observed NADP conformational change during the substrate binding in the C284S mutant might also occur in the wild-type enzyme. The Glu250 and NAD(P) flexibilities There is no structural evidence about the wildtype holoenzyme providing an explanation to the Glu250 pKa shift toward a basic value (7.6) as postulated to occur in solution when the cofactor binds (Marchal & Branlant, 1999). Indeed, Glu250 has the same position in the Apo1 and Holo1 crysÊ tal structures and is at least 6.9 A away from Cys284. Therefore, the Glu250 pKa measurement suggests a crystal holoenzyme conformation differ-

ing from that existing in solution by the Glu250 orientation. Another unambiguously de®ned Glu250 side-chain orientation is now observed in the C284S binary and ternary complexes, at 3.15 Ê and 3 A resolution, respectively, in comparison with that observed in Apo1 and Holo1. Its carboxÊ ylate group is situated 3 A from Ser284 oxygen atom. This could be related with the mutation as already mentioned. However, the shift is observed also in the Apo2 structure, where Glu250 is situÊ ated 3.7 A from Cys284. ALDH structure comparisons (ALDH1, RalDH2, ALDH2, ALDH3, ALDH9, Apo1, Holo1, Apo2) reveal the same characteristics, i.e. NAD(P) and glutamate ¯exibilities, required for the catalytic mechanism. In ALDH3, the NAD conformation is syn, in contrast with the anti conformation observed in the other structures; the cofactor is buried less in comparison with the

other ALDH structures. Two NAD conformations are observed in ALDH1, where the Glu268 electron density (corresponding to Glu250 in Sm-ALDH) is poorly de®ned and its side-chain accompanied by high B factors (Moore et al., 1998). The electron density is also reported to be stronger in the cofactor ADP part in ALDH9 (Johansson et al., 1998), while the nicotinamide moiety is disordered in an ALDH2 structure (Steinmetz et al., 1997). All these observations are consistent with Glu250 mobility and then with its ability to move closer to Cys284, as observed in the C284S binary and C284S ternary Ê complex mutant where Ser284 is situated 3 A from Glu250 and in Apo2, where Glu250 is located Ê 3.7 A from Cys284. Moreover, the Glu250 sidechain rotation can occur with only a few changes in the catalytic site, like the SO4b binding observed in Apo2. In the ternary complex, C284S and Apo2

structures, the Glu250 carboxylate group no longer interacts with the Arg437 guanidinium group. Moreover, the distances with Leu159, Thr229, Thr285, Leu405 methyl groups and the Phe444 aroÊ matic ring are less than 5 A (Table 2). The association of the salt-bridge loss and hydrophobic environment may lead to the Glu250 pKa increase to 7.6. Thr229, Leu251, Phe444 and Leu405 are highly conserved in the ALDH family. Leu159 is mainly replaced by methionine or isoleucine residues (Perozich et al., 1999). This suggests a similar role for all these hydrophobic residues in ALDHs (Figure 1). As the above-mentioned pKa measurements were performed at 4  C after an enzyme incubation of 18 hours in the presence of a large excess of NADP (Marchal & Branlant, 1999) at pH 5-6, it is likely that the structures in solution at 4  C differed

147 within acylation. An isotope effect is also observed for the wild-type in the acylation step (Table 3). The combined observations of a substrate isotope effect on the acylation for both the wild-type and the mutant enzymes, and of the very low ef®ciency of the acylation step for the mutants suggest a direct interaction between the Asn154 amide group and the oxygen atom of the thiohemiacetal intermediate and/or the oxygen atom of the G3P aldehyde group. This hypothesis is strongly supported by inspection of the Apo2 and the ternary complex C284S/NADP/G3P structures, which show the NH2 group of the Asn154 side-chain pointing towards one of the SO4b oxygen atoms and the oxygen atom of the G3P aldehyde group, respectively. Altogether, these results provide evidence for an oxyanion hole composed of at least residue Asn154. Within the acylation, Asn154 would ®rst stabilise the substrate binding and tetrahedral intermediate and secondly, decrease the pKapp of the thiohemiacetal hydroxyl group such that it is deprotonated at physiological pH, thus permitting an ef®cient hydride transfer towards the C4 position of the oxidised cofactor without base catalyst assistance. The fact that for the C284S mutant the acylation is rate-limiting, but that no isotope effect is observed with D-[1-2H]G3P, indicates that the ratelimiting step occurs prior to the hydride transfer. Thus, the very low catalytic ef®ciency of the C284S mutant is likely due to poor nucleophilicity of the Ser284 hydroxyl group within the Sm-ALDH protein context, which in turn should prevent ef®cient formation of the hemiacetal intermediate. This probably explains why under the experimental X-ray conditions used, the non-covalent ternary complex C284S-NADP-G3P was chemically stable within the crystal. NAD(P) binding mode in ALDHs The analysis of the ALDH holoenzyme structures reveals a new binding mode of the cofactor to the Rossmann fold in comparison with the usual binding mode where the cofactor is perpendicular to the plane of the b-sheet. This latter NAD(P) binding mode and the Rossmann fold characteristics have been described extensively (Wierenga

from those determined by X-ray crystallography at 20  C. However, the Glu250 pKa is also measured at 20  C when G3P and NADP were added. Thereby the Glu250 pKa increase could be due to its positioning in a hydrophobic environment as we observed in Apo2 (wild-type apoenzyme) and in the C284S binary and ternary structures. Nevertheless, a Cys284-Ser284 mutation effect cannot be totally excluded in this case. Biochemical and enzymatic properties of N154A, N154T and C284S mutants Over a pH range from 5 to 9.5, substitution of Asn154 by Thr or Ala results in a decrease of the kcat value by two or three orders of magnitude, respectively (Table 3). No changes in the apparent KM values for substrate and cofactor are observed (data not shown). These mutations also suppress the pre-steady-state burst of NADPH production observed for the wild-type enzyme (Marchal et al., 2000), indicating that the rate-limiting step is shifted from the deacylation step in the wild-type to the acylation step in the mutant enzyme. The acylation is at least 103 to 104-fold less ef®cient compared to the wild-type. The fact that an isotope effect is observed for the N154A or N154T mutants when D-[1-2H]G3P is used as the substrate proves that hydride transfer has become rate-limiting

148 et al., 1986; Carugo & Argos, 1997; Bellamacina 1996), especially the interactions of the ®rst loop containing the famous GXGXXG ®ngerprint with the NAD(P) pyrophosphate group. In ALDHs, the cofactor straddles the Rossmann fold. The ®ngerprint GX4G (Liu et al., 1997) in ALDHs is found in the loop connecting the fourth b-strand to the fourth a-helix. In contrast to the other dehydrogenases, no interaction between an a-helix dipole and the NAD(P) pyrophosphate group is observed except in mitochondrial ALDH (Steinmetz et al., 1997). The small number of interactions between the cofactor and Rossmann fold in ALDHs could be related to required movements of NAD(P) during the catalytic reaction (Moore et al., 1998). In order to study the new binding mode of the cofactor to ALDHs, nine NADP-dependent and 11 NAD-dependent proteins possessing a Rossmann fold were selected in a representative way from the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). Their cofactor binding domains were superimposed onto the Sm-ALDH NADP-binding domain taking the three central b-strands of the Rossmann fold as the common and invariant structural features in these enzymes (Figure 5(a) and (b)). The Rossmann folds differ in the number of b-strands and a-helices, and by the length of the secondary structure elements. However, the standard NAD(P) binding mode to the Rossmann fold, i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the b-sheet, is observed in all the selected proteins except Sm-ALDH. The most striking point concerns the length of the ®rst loop connecting the ®rst b-strand to the ®rst a-helix of the domain. The loop in Sm-ALDH is longer than in the other selected NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases. The superposition of the known ALDH Rossmann fold structures and the sequence alignments show that all ALDHs possess this long loop, which contains a strictly conserved proline residue (Pro156 in Sm-ALDH). Figure 6 displays the virtual interaction of the Sm-ALDH Rossmann fold with NAD as it binds in a classical manner to the Rossmann fold of Bacillus stearothermophilus GAPDH. Bad contacts occurred between the adenosine moiety and the conserved long loop. The orientation of the loop in the ALDH family could arise from the presence of the conserved proline residue. Therefore, the conjunction of the conserved proline residue and length of the loop could be structural determining factors responsible for the cofactor binding mode to the Rossmann fold observed in ALDHs. These structural characteristics probably have a role in the NADP conformational change observed in the Sm-ALDH ternary complex and both NAD positions observed in ALDH1 (Moore et al., 1998), thereby enabling the ef®ciency of the catalytic reaction.

ALDH Catalytic Mechanism

chain positions of a few residues, notably the catalytic Glu250 and Arg437 observed in interaction with Glu250 in Apo1. The side-chain rotation, due to the binding of a second sulphate anion in Apo2, reveals Glu250 ¯exibility. This ¯exibility is con®rmed by comparing its observed position in the Apo1, Holo1, binary and ternary complex of C284S mutant structures. The present structural studies combined with previous biochemical studies (Marchal & Branlant, 1999; Marchal et al., 2000) show a local structural reorganisation associated with cofactor and substrate binding which could explain the pKa variations of Cys284 and Glu250, and the change in Cys284 accessibility necessary for the catalytic reaction. The chemical activation of Cys284 could be due to the main-chain NH groups on both sides of Cys284 (i.e. the peptide nitrogen atoms of Cys284 and Thr285), while the 7.6 value for Glu250 pKa could result from a conserved hydrophobic environment in ALDHs. The results of the Apo2 and ternary complex structure comparison are in agreement with the presence of an oxyanion hole composed of the invariant Asn154 and the catalytic Cys284 NH group, which both interact by hydrogen bonding with one of the four sulphate oxygen atoms of Apo2 and the aldehyde carbonyl group of the substrate. Our biochemical data on the Asn154 mutants show a strong kcat decrease and a substrate isotope effect that support this conclusion. When the substrate binds, a different nicotinamide mononucleoside conformation is observed, while several NAD conformations are found in the NAD-dependent ALDH structures. This NAD(P) ¯exibility could be due to its peculiar mode of binding to the Rossmann fold. The comparison with several dehydrogenases shows that a conserved loop length between the ®rst b-strand and the ®rst a-helix in association with a conserved proline residue could be the structural determining factors of its new binding mode and therefore of the NAD(P) movements required for the catalytic mechanism of ALDHs.

Material and Methods
Materials C284S, N154A and N154T mutants were produced and puri®ed following a procedure similar to that described for wild-type and other Sm-ALDH mutants (Marchal & Branlant, 1999). The Apo2 structure Crystallisation and data collection Apo2 was crystallised under two sets of conditions, using the hanging drop method at 20  C: 2 ml of protein solution at a concentration of 5 mg/ml was mixed with 2 ml of reservoir containing 2.0 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) and over a range of 1 to Ê 5 % acetone. These Apo2 crystals diffract poorly at 3 A resolution. The data were collected at 100 K using glu-

cose as cryogenic agent. The second Apo2 crystal form was obtained with a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml: 2 ml of protein solution was mixed with 2 ml of reservoir containing 2.0 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.5) and 2 % PEG 400. The data were collected at 100 K using an image plate detector and an Enraf NonÊ ius rotating anode with a wavelength of 1.54 A. The cryogenic solution was composed of 20 % glycerol. The Ê crystals diffracted at 2.5 A resolution. The space group of both crystal forms is P21212. These latter crystals were used to solve the structure.

Ê È R-factor (Brunger, 1992) including all data at 2.5 A resolution were 23.2 % and 28 %, respectively. Binary and ternary complex of C284S mutant Crystallisation The puri®ed C284S mutant was dialysed in a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4), containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, at 4  C. The enzyme was next concentrated at 40 mg/ml. The holo enzyme was obtained by addition of NADP at a ®nal concentration of 16 mM. The droplet consisted of 2 ml of protein solution and 6 ml of 2.0 M ammonium sulphate. The crystals reached their maximal size in few days using the hanging drop method at 20  C. Next, D-G3P was added to obtain a droplet at 2.5 mM D-G3P. Data collection and structure resolution Data for the crystals of the binary and ternary complex of C284S mutant were collected at 100 K using a DIP2030 image plate detector and an Enraf Nonius rotat-

ing anode. Data were processed and merged using DENZO and SCALEPACK packages (Otwinowsky & Minor, 1997). Crystals of binary and ternary complex of C284S mutant belong to space group P3221 (Table 4). The structures were solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and the holoenzyme structure (Cobessi et al., 1999) (PDB entry 2euh) as template. As in the orthorhombic form, one tetramer is present in the asymmetric unit. Models were rebuilt using TURBOFRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991), and O (Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1990). Successive energy minimisation using a conjugate gradient minimisation, molecular dynamics at 3000 K by simulated annealing, occupancy re®nement and ®nally grouped B-factor re®nement were performed È using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1990), working with 75.5 % (56,846 re¯ections) and 81.1 % (51,464 re¯ections) of data for the ternary and binary C284S complexes, respectively, i.e. a cutoff of 2s on F. At the end of the proÈ cedure, the free R-factor (Brunger, 1992) was 28.3 % and Ê the R-factor was 24.2 %, at 2s(F) and 3 A resolution , for È the ternary complex. The free R-factor (Brunger, 1992) and R-factor for the C284S mutant holostructure were Ê 27.3 % and 22.8 %, respectively, at 2s(F) and 3.15 A resolution. For these structures, a non-crystallographic symmetry restraint was applied during the whole re®nement. Indeed, its absence would lead to a divergent evolution of Rfree and Rcryst (Kleywegt & Jones, 1995) due to the high number of re®ned parameters compared with the number of re¯ections present at such resolutions.

Note: in the binary and ternary C284S structures, the nicotinamide mononucleoside part of NADP was positioned as best as possible in the poor-quality electron density. All the mentioned observations, distances, and comparisons were performed from the monomer A as the D-G3P density is correctly de®ned inside it. In the other monomers the G3P electron density is poorly de®ned. Steady-state kinetics Initial rate measurements were carried out on a Kontron Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer by following the NADPH appearance at 340 nm and 25  C. The standard experimental conditions were 1 mM NADP, 0.2 mM D-G3P and 15 mN C284S, 4 mN N154A or 0.66 mN N154T mutant enzyme in 50 mM Tes buffer (pH 8.2), 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Deuterium isotope effects D-[1-2H]G3P was prepared as described (Corbier et al., 1990). Its concentration was determined enzymatically. Isotope effects on wild-type and N154A/T mutants were measured in 50 mM Tes buffer (pH 8.2), 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol by direct comparison of the initial velocities measured with D-G3P or D-[1-2H]G3P (0.1 mM and 0.2 mM) in the presence of 1 mM NADP at 25  C. Isotope measurement of the wild-type pre-steady-state kinetics was carried out on a SFM 3 Biologic Instrument stopped-¯ow apparatus (Biologic, Grenoble France) using a tungsten lamp and a 5 nm slit as light source. As for steady-state kinetics, time-courses for the reaction of wild-type enzyme with D-G3P or D-[1-2H]G3P and NADP were followed by the appearance of NADPH monitored at 340 nm, at a constant temperature of 10  C, at pH 8.2. The experiment was set up with one syringe ®lled with wild-type enzyme (16 mN) and the other one containing 1 mM NADP and 0.1 or 0.2 mM D-G3P or D-[1-2H]G3P. The continuously measured absorbance was digitised and directly analysed as the sum of exponential and linear components with the Biokine program employing non-linear regression analysis. Protein Data Bank accession numbers Atomic coordinates of Apo2 and the ternary complex were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, accession numbers 1qi6 and 1qi1, respectively.
