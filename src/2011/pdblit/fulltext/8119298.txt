A proteinase having wide substrate specificity was isolated from Streptomyces fradiae ATCC 14544. This proteinase, which we propose to call SFase-2, was purified from the culture filtrate by S-Sepharose chromatography. The purified enzyme showed an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa on SDSPAGE. When synthetic peptides were used as substrates, SFase-2 showed broad substrate specificity. It also hydrolyzed keratin, elastin and collagen as proteinaceous substrates. It was completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate and chymostatin, but not by tosylphenylalaninechloromethane, tosyllysinechloromethane or EDTA, indicating that it can be classified as a serine proteinase. The matured protein sequence of SFase-2 was determined by a combination of amino acid sequencing and the DNA sequencing of the gene. SFase-2, consisting of 191 amino acids, is a novel proteinase. It showed 76% similarity in the amino acid sequence with Streptomyces griseus proteinase A [Johnson P. and Smillie L. B. (1974) FEBS Lett. 47, 1-61. For insight into the three-dimensional structure of SFase-2, we obtained single crystals by the vapor diffusion method using sodium phosphate as a precipitant. These crystals belonged to the orthorhombic, space group P2,2,2, with cell dimensions a = 6.92 nm, b = 7.28 nm, c = 2.99 nm; one molecule was present in the asymmetric unit.

Many studies have been done with the serine proteinases produced by Streptomycetes. Streptomyces griseus, in particular, produces many proteinases [ l , 21, three of which have been well studied: proteinase A (SGPA) [3],proteinase B (SGPB) [4], and trypsin-like proteinase [ 5 ] .These enzymes have been isolated from the commercially available extracellular filtrate, termed Pronase (Kaken Seiyaku, Tokyo) ; their primary structures, biochemical properties and X-ray structures have been reported [6- 81. Recently, an acidic-aminoacid-specific proteinase from S. griseus has been described [9, 101. The serine proteinases produced by S. fradiae have been described by Morihara et al. 1111 and Nickerson et al. [12]. They reported that S. fradiae produced a `keratinase' and

secreted many multiple proteinases. Morihara et al. also showed the existence of a trypsin-like proteinase in the culture broth of S. fradiae [13]. We recently reported on an acidic-amino-acid-specific proteinase from S. fradiae [ 141. In the present study, we have isolated a novel proteinase from the same strain of Streptomyces. It possesses characteristics similar to SGPA and SGPB. In the present paper, we report on the purification, characterization, primary structure determination and crystallization of this proteinase, which we call SFase-2, and also discuss the preliminary crystallographic study of these crystals.

Np and Z-Gly-Trp-NH-Np and produced pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor and a glutamic-acid-specific endopeptidase from Bacillus Zicheniformis (BLase) [15]. The protein assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad, the protein molecular mass marker `Rainbow' from Amersham, the HPLC column Protein C, from Vydac, Centricon-10 microconcentrators from Amicon and the isoelectric focusing calibration kit from Pharmacia. Restriction endonucleases and the enzymes used for DNA manipulation were purchased from Takara Shuzo, the DNA amplification reagent kit from Perkin Elmer Cetus, the nylon membrane (Zeta-probe) from Bio-Rad, and radiolabeled deoxyribonucleotide from Amersham. Streptomyces fradiae ATCC 14544 was used as a producer of SFase-2 and Escherichia coli JM103 as the host for cloning the SFase-2 gene. All other reagents were commercial products of the highest grade available. ity toward Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-NH-Np were collected in a volume of 2 1, dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 (20 1x3, 20 h), and pooled. This final enzyme preparation showed a single protein band on SDS/PAGE.

SDSffAGE and isoelectric focusing
SDSPAGE was performed on a 15% gel as described by Laemmli [16] using the molecular mass marker `Rainbow' to estimate the molecular mass and the purity. Isoelectric focusing was performed in the pH range 3.0-10.0 using PhastSystem (Pharmacia) to determine the isoelectric point, PI.

Kinetic measurements
With some substrates, the kinetic parameters were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots of initial rates at different concentrations of substrate. Each assay was performed at 25°C in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 containing 10% dimethylformamide in 1-ml cuvettes. The change in absorbance at 410 nm was monitored continuously and the initial linear velocity was used to calculate the kinetic constants.

Assay of enzyme activity
Enzyme activity was measured using Z-Ala-Ala-LeuNH-Ph as the substrate; the reaction was started by adding an appropriate amount of an enzyme solution composed of 0.05 mM Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-NH-Ph, 10% dimethylformamide and 5 0 m M Tris/HCl pH8.5 to make a final volume of 1.0ml. After 15 min of reaction at 25"C, the absorbance of liberated p-nitroaniline was measured at 410 nm. When the substrate was Z-Ala-Ah-Leu-NH-Ph, the specific activity of SFase-2 was expressed as the amount (pmol) of liberated p-nitroaniline using 1.O mg SFase-2 in 1 min under the above conditions. The enzyme was also tested for its ability to hydrolyze the protein substrates elastin, collagen type I and keratinazure. The reaction mixture contained 10 mg substrate in 50 mM TrisMCl pH 8.5 in a final volume of 1.0 ml; reaction times were 1 h to 2 days at room temperature. Elastolytic and collagenolytic activities were measured at 280 nm and keratinolytic activity at 600 nm.

Amino acid analysis
After hydrolysis in 4 M methanesulfonic acid containing 0.2% 3-(2-aminoethyl)indole at 110°C for 24 h, the amino acid composition was determined with an amino acid analyzer (model 835 Hitachi).

,

N-terminal and C-terminal sequence determination
Automated Edman degradation was performed with a model 477A Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequencer equipped with a 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. After inhibition by diisopropylfluorophosphate (i,PrP-F) of SFase2 (i,PrP-SFase-2), the N-terminal sequence was determined. The C-terminal sequence was determined by digestion of i,PrP-SFase-2 with BLase or trypsin ([substrate]/[enzyme] = 40) at 25 "C for 48 h in 25 mM TrisMCl pH 7.5; the resulting digests were separated by HPLC using Protein C, column (4.6X250 mm) under various conditions. Sequences for all fragments of peptide thus obtained were determined.

Protein concentration
The protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard.

Purification of SFase-2 Streptomyces fi-adiae ATCC 14544 was cultivated using the methods described by Morihara et al. [ l l ] . The culture was centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 30 min to remove the cells and the resultant supernatant was precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation. This precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 30 min, followed by dissolution in 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 7.5, 2 mM CaC1, and dialysis against the same buffer, with subsequent lyophylization. The resulting material was used as crude enzyme for the following preparation. This crude enzyme (37.5 g) was dissolved in 500 ml 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.25 and dialyzed against the same buffer (5 1, 20 h). After centrifugation (10000 rpm, 20 min), the supernatant was loaded onto an S-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5x50 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After the column had been washed with 3 1 of the same buffer, elution was carried out by stepwise increase of the concentration of NaCl (0.05 M, 0.075 M and 1.0 M) in the same buffer (3 1 of each). The fractions containing activ-

Cloning of the SFase-2 gene
Oligonucleotide primers for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning of the SFase-2 gene were designed on the basis of the most-frequent-codon usage of Streptomyces genes [17], in which the third letter was almost restricted to G or C. Two kinds of single primers were synthesized on the basis of peptide sequences derived from the N-terminus of SFase-2 and obtained by its digestion with trypsin by using the gene assembler plus DNA synthesizer (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology). Sense and antisense primers were the 23residue 5'-GGCGGCGAGGCCATCTACGCCGC-3'and the 24-residue S'-GGCCTTGGTGACCGGCTGGAAGAA-3`; these were derived from possible DNA sequences corresponding to two parts of partial amino acid sequences of SFase-2; Gly-Gly-Glu-Ala-Ile-Tyr-Ala-Ala (N-terminal residues 3 - 10) and Phe-Phe-Gln-Pro-Val-Th-Lys-Ala (unknown position), respectively. PCR was performed for 30 cycles on a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus) using a DNA amplification reagent kit. The thermal cycle of the PCR procedures included

denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. The resultant 540-bp PCR product was ligated in pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Inc.) and directly sequenced as described by Gibbs et al. [18].

Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic study
Crystallization conditions were screened by the hangingdrop vapor-diffusion method [ 191. The stock solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Centricon-I 0. The solution was mixed 1 :1 (by vol.) with well solution that contained the appropriate buffer and precipitant. Crystallization was attempted between room temperature and 4 ° C pH 4.09.0, and protein concentration 5 - 20 mg/ml before equilibration by vapor diffusion. After determination of the crystallization conditions, large-scale crystallization was performed by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion methods [191. Crystals were mounted and sealed in 1.0-mm glass capillaries with a small portion of mother liquor. X-ray diffraction photographs were taken at room temperature with a precession camera using Ni-filtered CuKa radiation from a sealed X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 35 mA.

The purification procedures of SFase-2 are summarized in Table 1. The purity was determined by SDSlPAGE (Fig. 1), isoelectric focusing (described later), and HPLC chromatography. All results indicated that SFase-2 is purified as a homogeneous enzyme. The overall yield was 72.6% but did not result in an increase in the specific activity toward Z-Ala-Ah-Leu-NH-Np. This indicates that the culture broth contains numerous proteinases [ l l ] ; for example, metalloproteinase, aminopeptidase and other chymotrypsin-like proteinases, which non-specifically cleave the substrate Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-NH-Np. The metalloproteinase will produce Leu-NH-Np from Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-NH-Np, followed by liberation of the p-nitroanilide from Leu-NH-Np hydrolyzed by aminopeptidase. As a result, the value for the specific activity of the starting material may appear to be higher.

Characterization of SFase-2
The optimum pH of SFase-2 was measured using 0.04 mM Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-NH-Np as substrate in a series of 50 mM buffers containing 10% dimethylformamide ; sodium acetate pH 2.8-6.0, sodium phosphate pH 5.5-8.2, Tris/HCl pH 6.1 -9.6 and glycinate/NaOH pH 7.5-11.2. After the solution was allowed to react at 25°C for 15 min, the absorbance was measured at 410 nm. The effect of pH on the stability of SFase-2 was examined with the above buffers after the mixture had been left standing for 3 h at 37°C. The pH of the solutions was adjusted to pH 8.5, then the activity was measured. The optimum pH of SFase-2 was around 8.5 and 70% of the original activity remained at pH 2.8-9.5. These results indicate that SFase-2 is a typical alkaline proteinase. Morihara et al. [ l l ] reported that S. frudiae produced many proteinases (I, Ib, 11, 111, IV and crystals). SFase-2 is similar to 11, I11 and the crystals with respect to the purification profile, optimum pH and pH stability. These proteinases (11, 1 1 and crystals) became inactivated with heat treatment 1 for 10 min at 80°C. The thermostability of SFase-2 was ex-

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Purification of SFase-2
The crude enzyme (37.5 g) from the culture broth of Streptomyces frudiae ATCC 14544 was used as starting material. Stepwise elution was achieved by S-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 1). As the result, an acidic-amino-acid-specific proteinase [14] was eluted with 0.05 M NaCl in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.25; SFase-2 was obtained next with about 0.075 M NaCl in the same buffer. As a final step, the fraction containing trypsin-like proteinase activity was found with the eluate of 1.0 M NaCl.

amined by leaving it standing for 15 min at 80°C in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+.As more than 30% of the original activity remained, SFase-2 is more thermostable than these proteinases (11, I11 and crystals) and may differ from them. Morihara et al. [ll] also reported that the Ib proteinase retained 72% of its activity after treatment at 80°C for 1 h in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+.SFase-2 was completely inactivated under these conditions. SFase-2 may also not be identical with Ib proteinase. The effects of various inhibitors on SFase-2 activities were examined. SFase-2 was completely inactivated by a typical serine proteinase inhibitor (iPr,P-F), but not by a metalloproteinase inhibitor such as EDTA. Thus, SFase-2 was classified as a serine proteinase. Adding metal ions did not effect its activity. Table 2 lists the effects of inhibitors. TosPheCH,Cl, a specific inhibitor of a-chymotrypsin, caused no inhibition; this agreed with the result of a previous study showing that SGPA and SGPB, which are classified as chymotrypsin-like proteinases by their three-dimensional structure but do not have identical substrate specificity, were not inhibited by TosPheCH,Cl [13. The specificity of SFase-2 for synthetic substrates was examined by using a series of p-nitroanilide (-NH-Np) substrates. As is evident from Table 3, SFase-2 cleaved a variety of substrates and showed the highest reactivity for Suc-AlaAla-Pro-Phe-NH-Np among them, with a specific activity of 50.0 pmol . min-' . mg-'. On the other hand, SFase-2 also hydrolyzed the Arg substrates, a result which agrees with the inhibition study. Thus, the specific trypsin-like proteinase inhibitors such as pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, soy-

bean trypsin inhibitor and aprotinin, inhibited SFase-2 activity using Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-NH-Np as substrate (Table 2), in agreement with the results of a previous study of SGPA and SGPB [20]. These results indicate that SFase-2 has broad substrate specificity, and prefers a hydrophobic residue at the P1 position [21], but not for short substrates. The conflicting substrate specificity for Phe and Arg residues is not understood. We hope to elucidate these problems by solving the three-dimensional structure of SFase-2. The kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of seven p-nitroanilide substrates are shown in Table 4.Elongation of the substrate at the N-terminal increased the k,,,/K, value, indicating that SFase-2 has an extended active site. Substitution of the Ala residue by Pro in the P, position [21] increased the k,,,/K,,, value 10-fold. The behavior of SFase-2 in the presence of these substrates is similar to that of the chymotrypsin-like proteinases from S. griseus and S. frudiae [7, 22 -251. The ability of SFase-2 to hydrolyze proteinaceous substrates was examined with elastin, collagen type I and keratin-azure. The enzyme showed the ability to hydrolyze all of these substrates, especially collagen and keratin. The molecular mass of proteinase was estimated to be 19 kDa by SDSPAGE, as shown Fig. 1. This value agreed well with that of 19002 kDa calculated from the amino acid sequence, which is described below. Sinha et al. reported that S. frudiae produced two serine proteinases which have molecular masses of 17.6 kDa and 24 kDa [26]. Judging

Partial nucleotide sequence of the SFase-2 gene
To sequence the DNA fragment encoding the mature protein of SFase-2, the PCR method [27] was adopted. Upstream and downstream primers were designed from two known amino acid sequences at positions 3-10 of the N-terminal sequence and one (Thr-Gly-Gly-Thr-Thr-Phe-Phe-Gln-ProVal-Thr-Glu-Ala-Leu) of the peptide fragments (unknown position), which were isolated from trypsin digests of i,PrPSFase-2. A DNA fragment of about 540 bp was amplified by PCR with the sense and antisense primers described above. Sequence analysis of the 540-bp PCR product revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence contained the partial sequence determined by sequencing SFase-2, demonstrating that the amplified DNA fragment is derived from the SFase2 gene. Taken together with its N- and C-terminal sequences, the mature protein sequence of SFase-2 was completed (Fig. 2), and found to be compatible with both the amino acid composition and the molecular mass. Fig. 3 shows the alignment of the sequences of various proteinases from Streptomycetes. SFase-2 and SGPA have 76% similarity in the sequence, and 67% similarity with SGPB. The catalytically essential triad residues His57, Asp102 and Serl95 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) for serine proteinase are conserved at the positions corresponding to His35, Asp65 and Ser147 and the regions of catalytic site topographies of the three proteinases show high levels of similarity. Also, SFase-2 has four cysteine residues (Cysl5, Cys36, Cysl41, Cys167) in positions identical to those of SGPA and SGPB. Since two disulfide bridges in SGPA and SGPB are formed between Cysl5 and Cys36 and between Cysl41 and Cys167 [6], the disulfide bridges of SFase-2 may be formed in a similar manner. Furthermore, SFase-2 has 90% similarity in the N-terminal sequence of 20 residues with a 17.6-kDa chymotrypsin-like proteinase reported by Sinha et al. [26]. Sinha et al. did not determine the complete amino acid sequence of their proteinase, but since they produced it from the same strain of Streptomyces as SFase-2, after determining its primary structure, much sequence similarity can be expected.

from the difference in the molecular mass, SFase-2 may differ from these two enzymes. Isoelectric focusing of SFase-2 revealed one sharp band, corresponding to a PI of 8.5 (data not shown). The amino acid composition of SFase-2 was analyzed and showed good agreement with that deduced from the DNA sequence (Table 5). Table 5 also shows the amino acid compositions of other chymotrypsin-like proteinases which have been reported. SFase-2 is very similar to SGPA and SGPB in both amino acid composition and molecular mass. The amino-terminal sequence of i,PrP-SFase-2 was determined up to the 20th residue, and the sequence Ile-Ala-Gly-

Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic study

Thin-plate crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method [17], using sodium phosphate as the precipitant. However, these were twinned crystals and were not suitable for X-ray analysis. The twinning effect could be reduced by adding 5% (by vol.) dioxane to the reservoir. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique in a sealed petri dish [19]. The protein in 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 was mixed Gly-Glu-Ala-Ile-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Xaa-Ser- an equal volume of reservoir solution. The reservoir with Leu-Gly-Phe-Asn- was obtained. In order to examine the C- consisted of 1.3 M sodium phosphate pH 4.2, 5% (by vol.) terminal sequence, the i,PrP-SFase-2 was digested by BLase, dioxane. Long plated crystals (Fig. 4) appeared in 5 -7 days a glutamic-acid-specific proteinase, and each degradation at room temperature and grew to dimensions of product was separated by HPLC. After determining the 3.0 mmX0.2 mmX0.2 mm in approximately 4 weeks.

Fig. 3. Alignment of the amino acid sequences for SFase-2, SGPA and SGPB. Identical residues of the three proteinases are boxed; the catalytically essential triad residues His, Asp and Ser are shaded.

Fig.4. Crystal of SFase-2. Conditions for crystal growth are described in the text. The dimensions are 3.OXO.ZXO.Z mm.

61 The crystallographic character was determined by precession photographs taken with an Enraf-Nonius camera. The crystals diffract beyond 0.16-nm resolution and belong to the orthorhombic space group P2,2,2,, with cell dimensions u = 6.92 nm, b = 7.28 nm, c = 2.99 nm. They are apparently unaffected by several days of exposure to the X-ray beam. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule. The volume of the molecule is 1.98X10-3 nm3/Da and the solvent content is 37.5% [28]. The crystals are suitable for detailed high-resolution crystallographic analysis. We also obtained twinned crystals using potassium phosphate as precipitant. The crystallization conditions for SFase2 are similar to those of SGPA and SGPB. The crystals of SGPA were obtained with sodium phosphate [6], those of SGPB with potassium phosphate [7]. This indicates that the crystallization conditions may be related to the primary structures. X-ray structure analysis of the chymotrypsin-like proteinase produced from S. griseus has already been reported [6, 71, but not that for the proteinase from S. fradiae. It should be very interesting to clarify the difference between the threedimensional structures of these proteinases. Such work is now in progress in our laboratory. We have reported on an acidic-amino-acid-specific proteinase from S. frudiae [14]. We were successful in expressing its proteinase and are now working on its crystallization with the aim of correlating the three-dimensional structure of proteinases with their recognition of acidic amino acids.
