ORF34p2 is expressed in large amounts during the early phases of phage infection, suggesting an important role in this process. Gel-shift assays, surface plasmon resonance and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that ORF34p2 interacts with single-strand DNA with nanomolar affinity. We also determined the crystal structure of ORF34p2 and showed that it bears a variation of the typical oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding-fold of SSBs. Finally, we found that ORF34p2 is able to stimulate Escherichia coli RecA-mediated homologous recombination. The specific structural and biochemical properties that distinguish ORF34p2 from other SSB proteins are discussed.

Introduction
Single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) proteins are present in all organisms and play an essential role in their growth and metabolic activities. They are involved in multiple pathways of DNA metabolism, including replication, recombination and repair in Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya and viruses (Lohman and Ferrari, 1994; Wold, 1997). In particular, they coat and protect singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates and facilitate pairing of homologous strands by pre-empting DNA secondary structures. The SSB proteins can bind ssDNA in a non-specific and cooperative manner and form filaments that can saturate long stretches of ssDNA (Lohman and Ferrari, 1994). Besides, SSBs can interact with a large number of heterologous proteins and these interactions both regulate and can be regulated by the interaction with ssDNA (Wold, 1997). Under particular conditions, SSBs can stimulate the assembly of recombinases on ssDNA. Moreover, the filaments formed from SSB­recombinase interactions are in general more efficient in strand-exchange reactions than filaments formed by recombinase alone (Sung, 1997). Indeed, the presence of EcoSSB permits the formation of a continuous filament of RecA protein by destabilizing the secondary structure of ssDNA (Meyer and Laine, 1990). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the SSB protein RPA (Replication Protein A) stimulates the formation of nucleoprotein filaments including the recombinase Rad51 and, in combination with Rad52, stimulates

Summary
Lactococcus lactis, a Gram-positive bacterium widely used by the dairy industry, is subject to infection by a diverse population of virulent phages, predominantly by those of the 936 group, including the siphovirus phage p2. Confronted with the negative impact of phage infection on milk fermentation, the study of the biology of lactococcal provides insight from applied and fundamental perspectives. We decided to characterize the product of the orf34 gene from lactococcus phage p2, which was considered as a candidate single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) due to its localization downstream of a gene coding for a single-strand annealing protein. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that

Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange (Sung, 1997; Shinohara et al., 1998). From a structural viewpoint SSBs exist as monomeric or multimeric proteins and, with few exceptions, they share a structural domain named OB-fold (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding-fold) involved in nucleic acid recognition. The OB-fold domains are variable in length and functions, mainly because of differences in the length of the loops forming the nucleic acid interaction surfaces. EcoSSB is the paradigm of SSB proteins within the OB-fold structural family (Theobald et al., 2003). The structure of EcoSSB consists of one a-helix and two three-stranded anti-parallel b-sheets that form a semi-open barrel from where two long loops protrude, one of them involved in ssDNA interaction (Murzin, 1993). The crystal structures of EcoSSB with (Raghunathan et al., 2000) and without ssDNA (Raghunathan et al., 1997; Matsumoto et al., 2000) confirmed that this protein forms homotetramers. Each monomer of the EcoSSB homotetramer consists of an N-terminal DNA binding domain, the OB-fold domain, followed by a C-terminal region, including a glycine-rich loop and an amphipathic tail. The C-terminal region is proposed to be involved in the interaction with enzymes of the DNA metabolism such as polymerases and recombinases (Genschel et al., 2000; Reddy et al., 2001; Jackson et al., 2002; He et al., 2003; Sun and Shamoo, 2003). In bacteriophages, SSBs proteins play critical roles in DNA replication and recombination. Both mechanisms are often closely coupled throughout much of the phage lytic cycle, particularly during recombination-dependent replication processes (Bleuit et al., 2001). In some coliphages, like T4 and T7, phage-encoded SSBs are essential for DNA replication and cannot be replaced by their host counterparts with which they share no homology (Kim and Richardson, 1993; Miller et al., 2003). In contrast, coliphage P1 (Hay and Cohen, 1983) and Bacillus phage SPP1 (Ayora et al., 1998) encode proteins highly homologous to the bacterial-host SSB. For these reasons, some phage SSBs have been identified by their sequence similarity to bacterial SSBs whereas others were recognized on the basis of their activity. The crystal structures of phage SSBs, such as the monomeric T4 gp32 (Shamoo et al., 1995), the dimeric T7 gp2.5 (Hollis et al., 2001) and GN5 from Escherichia coli filamentous phage f1 (Skinner et al., 1994; Su et al., 1997), confirmed their OB-fold structural and functional motif (Murzin, 1993). Virulent phages of Lactococcus lactis have a negative effect on milk fermentations, which explains the continuing interest on the biology of these phages, including their structure (Ricagno et al., 2006; Spinelli et al., 2006; Sciara et al., 2008), phage DNA replication and homologous recombination processes, as well as their interaction with their hosts (Moineau, 1999; Bouchard and Moineau,

2004; Ploquin et al., 2008). However, there are no structures of lactococcal SSBs available yet. In this work, we present the crystal structure of the ORF34p2 protein, encoded by the virulent L. lactis phage p2 (936 group). The orf34 gene (GenBank: GQ253898) is located downstream a putative single-strand annealing protein named Sak3 (Bouchard and Moineau, 2004). ORF34p2 probably belongs to a set of genes involved in phage-promoted DNA recombination, as postulated for the SSB protein of the lactococcal phage bIL67 ORF14bIL67 (Szczepanska et al., 2007). Indeed, ORF34p2 bears 33% sequence identity with ORF14bIL67 (Fig. 1). Of note, virulent phages bIL67 and p2 belong to genetically distinct groups of lactococcal siphoviridae phages, namely c2 and 936 respectively (Deveau et al., 2006). Despite the lack of homology with SSB proteins present in databases, ORF34p2 shares some characteristics generally observed in this protein family, notably the frequently found C-terminal phenylalanine (He et al., 2003), as well as features conserved among SSB proteins from lactococcal phages, such as the consensus sequence DLFGG near the C-terminus and three terminal residues LPF (Szczepanska et al., 2007). The presence of these features prompted us to explore the hypothesis that ORF34p2 is an SSB protein by studying its biochemical and structural properties.

Results and discussion
ORF34p2 is expressed early and abundantly during phage p2 infection To investigate the expression course of ORF34p2 during infection, we infected the host strain L. lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 with the virulent phage p2. Infection was allowed to proceed for 20 min, the minimum time reported before new p2 virions are released (Haaber et al., 2008). Intracellular proteins were extracted and run on 2D poly acrylamide gels. Proteomic profiles were compared between infected and non-infected cells in a time-course manner (Fig. 2). Based on the theoretical molecular weight (13 kDa) and pI (4.92) of ORF34p2, a spot corresponding to an early-expressed phage protein with apparent mass 15.4 kDa and pI 5.1 (Fig. 2) was picked out of the gels and analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry matched ORF34p2 protein with 97% of coverage and more than 95% of confidence. The analysis of the time-course experiment revealed that ORF34p2 was detected as early as 5 min post infection and that its concentration increased significantly over time (Fig. 2). In fact, ORF34p2 was one of the highest expressed phage p2 proteins (data not shown). Early and abundant expression likely correlate with important roles during the phage infection

process. It should be noted that SSBs in general are essential proteins, which cannot be deleted or replaced. Recombinant ORF34p2 forms dimers and tetramers in solution An N-terminally His-tagged ORF34p2 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified as a soluble protein that could be concentrated to 10 mg ml-1. Recombinant ORF34p2 was prone to time-dependent proteolysis, as SDS-PAGE gels showed signs of cleavage after keeping the protein for 5 days at 4°C (data not shown). SECMALS/UV/RI (Wyatt Technology) experiments suggest that ORF34p2 is a dimer (not shown), like coliphage T7 gp 2.5 (Hollis et al., 2001) or phage Pf3 SSB (Folmer et al.,

1994). However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the protein would also form tetramers (not shown), like EcoSSB (Raghunathan et al., 1997; 2000) and the lactococcal phage bIL67 SSB protein ORF14bIL67 (Szczepanska et al., 2007). The (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 mutant prepared for structural studies (see below and in Experimental procedures) showed characteristics similar to the native protein, but with a faster time-dependent degradation. ORF34p2 binds ssDNA in vitro Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were used to investigate the ssDNA- and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding properties of ORF34p2 (Fig. 3). QuantifiFig. 2.

cation of the DNA­protein complexes at 1 mM ORF34p2 concentration indicated that 40% of the ssDNA substrate was stably bound compared with 1% of the dsDNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 11). ORF34p2 binding to ssDNA was also monitored by EMSA using circular M13 ssDNA. As shown in Fig. 3B, titration of M13 ssDNA with increasing amounts of protein resulted in a band shift that reaches a plateau at a molar ratio of 400 ORF34p2 : M13 ssDNA (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Given the length of the M13 ssDNA [7249 nucleotides (nt)] and assuming a tetrameric organization of ORF34p2, this result implies a site size of ~72 nt, similar to the 65 nt wrapped around the EcoSSB homotetramer in one of its binding modes (Lohman and Overman, 1985). These results, based on ssDNAs with different sequences, also prove that, consistently with its presumed SSB function, ORF34p2 non-specifically binds ssDNA and not to dsDNA. This property is necessary to coat and protect ssDNA intermediates during DNA replication, repair and recombination (Gasior et al., 2001). To confirm the qualitative results of EMSA and to measure a dissociation constant for the ORF34p2­ssDNA complexes, we performed surface plasmon resonance experiments. This method has already been used to evaluate SSB­ssDNA interactions in real time (Wang et al., 2000). We coated a streptavidin sensor chip with ssDNA and recombinant ORF34p2 was injected over the chip surface at increasing concentrations, between 23 and 375 nM (Fig. S1). The mean dissociation constant (KD) value, based on three independent experiments, was 2.5 0.6 ¥ 10-8 M with an association (kon) and a dissociation (koff) rates of 1 0.2 ¥ 105 M-1 s-1 and 2.5 0.1 ¥ 10-3 s-1 respectively. These results confirms that ORF34p2 has a high affinity for ssDNA, although lower than other SSB proteins like EcoSSB (KD = 2.5 ¥ 10-9 M with faster kon and koff, 1.4 ¥ 105 M-1 s-1 and 3.4 ¥ 10-4 s-1 respectively) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis SSB (KD = 3.6 ¥ 10-9 M with a faster kon and koff, 6.3 ¥ 104 M-1 s-1 and 2.3 ¥ 10-4 s-1 respectively) (Reddy et al., 2001).

The crystal structure of ORF34p2 shows overall similarity with bacterial SSBs but with significant differences We determined the crystal structure of ORF34p2 to gain further insight into its possible role as an SSB protein. If that hypothesis could be confirmed, the structure of ORF34p2 would have the bonus of giving the first information at atomic detail of a lactococcal phage SSB protein, a family that shares no significant homology with any SSBs of known structure. The recombinant (native) ORF34p2 protein was crystallized with space group symmetry P212121 (Table 1). As low sequence identity with possible models precluded the possibility of solving the structure of the protein by the molecular replacement method and due to the absence of methionine residues in its sequence, we mutated leucines at positions 49 and 55 into methionines, thus generating the L49M-L55M double mutant M2B-ORF34p2. Seleno-methionyl (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 crystallizes under conditions and with different space group symmetry (P6322, Table 1) from the native protein. The structure of (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The structure of native ORF34p2 was subsequently solved by molecular replacement using the structure of (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 as search model. There is one ORF34p2 molecule per asymmetric unit in the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 hexagonal crystals and four in the orthorhombic crystals of native ORF34p2. Thus, we had at our disposal five independent monomers of ORF34p2 for structural analysis. As expected for an SSB protein, the N-terminal DNA binding domain of ORF34p2 has the overall structure of an OB-fold (Fig. 4A). Two secondary-structure elements in the structure of ORF34p2 differ significantly from the structures of other SSB proteins. Namely, the 1 strand is unusually long and, remarkably, the capping a-helix is absent. Instead, strands 3 and 4 are connected by an eight residues-long loop (P50­D57). These features are

to some extent present in the structures of SSB proteins from filamentous phages f1 (Su et al., 1997) and Pf3 (Folmer et al., 1995). Notwithstanding, ORF34p2 strongly differs from the f1SSB and Pf3SSB proteins with respect to the orientation of the 4-5 b-hairpin, which in ORF34p2 closely matches that of EcoSSB. Such difference implies that ORF34p2 builds dimers analogous to those found for EcoSSB and other bacterial SSB proteins, which are topologically different from the dimers formed by phage f1SSB and Pf3SSB (see below). In comparing the structure of the ORF34p2 monomer with that of EcoSSB, it is also noteworthy that the orientations of the 1, 2 and 3 strands in the former deviate from their orientation in EcoSSB. In ORF34p2 the 1-2 b-hairpin is farther and the L23 loop closer to the 4-5 b-hairpin of the same monomer respectively (Fig. 4A). As a result, the structure of the ORF34p2 monomer is more compact than that of the monomer of EcoSSB. Furthermore, these three structural motifs are also those exhibiting a higher variability within the five independent monomers presented in this study. Globally, the five independent ORF34p2 monomers can be superposed with a main-chain root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.8 Å for the alpha carbons of the 88 residues aligned. In comparison, superposition of the four independent monomers of the EcoSSB structure (PDB : 1QVC) onto monomer A from the native ORF34p2 structure, gives a main-chain r.m.s.d. of 3.9 Å for the alpha carbons of the 74 residues aligned. In both cases a 2.0 Å lower limit for structural similarity was enforced.

If the most flexible motifs are excluded and the rigid parts of the five ORF34p2 monomers are aligned separately, the main-chain alpha carbon r.m.s.d. falls to 0.55 Å for 81 residues aligned, as determined by the RAPIDO server (Mosca and Schneider, 2008). When the same approach is used with the EcoSSB monomers, their r.m.s.d. with respect to ORF34p2 falls to 1.3 Å for 51 residues aligned. Well-defined electronic density is lacking for the C-terminal region beyond residues 88­93 in all subunits of both the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 and the native ORF34p2 structures. This result is in line with previous data on EcoSSB (Savvides et al., 2004), M. tuberculosis SSB (Saikrishnan et al., 2003) and Thermotoga maritima SSB (DiDonato et al., 2006). Savvides and co-workers have proposed that the C-terminus of EcoSSB may protrude away from the DNA binding domain as a disordered/unstructured region (Savvides et al., 2004). Indeed, the low sequence complexity of the C-terminal domain of SSB proteins, heavily populated by proline, glycine and glutamine residues, had hinted at the possibility of the intrinsic disorder of this region (Sancar et al., 1981). Electron density was also too weak to support a model in parts of the L23 loop for one of the monomers in the native structure (residues K36-G37, monomer D) and for the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 monomer (residues K36-N39). Similarly, residues S70E72 (monomer D, native structure) and A69-V74 [(SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 monomer] belonging to the 4-5 b-hairpin could not be modelled.

Structure of the ORF34p2 dimer The SSB proteins can be found in a variety of oligomeric forms: monomeric [e.g. coliphage T4 gp32 (Shamoo et al., 1995)], dimeric [e.g. coliphage T7 gp2.5 (Hollis et al., 2001)], heterotrimeric [e.g. human RPA (Iftode et al., 1999)] and homotetrameric, as in bacterial SSB proteins such as EcoSSB. ORF34p2 protein forms dimers bearing the same structural disposition in both its native and the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 crystal forms. The asymmetric unit of the native ORF34p2 crystal includes two dimers while in the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 crystal one dimer is formed by the interaction between two symmetryrelated monomers (Fig. 4B). The fact that these crystalline forms belong to two different crystallographic space groups strongly supports the notion that the observed dimer has a physiological entity. In the ORF34p2 dimer, the extended, anti-parallel b-sheet formed by the one, four and five strands from each monomer observed in EcoSSB is also present and contributes eight hydrogen bonds to the dimer interface. Therefore, the ORF34p2 dimer is globally similar to that of EcoSSB and different from those formed by other phage SSB proteins such as f1SSB (Su et al., 1997), Pf3SSB (Folmer et al., 1995) or gp2.5 from coliphage T7 (Hollis et al., 2001). However, beyond the overall similarity, the differences observed between the ORF34p2 and the EcoSSB monomers translate into different arrangements of their respective dimers. The most salient difference between the ORF34p2 dimer and the dimers of bacterial SSB proteins is the close interaction between the L23 loop of each monomer and the 4-5 b-hairpin of the other monomer (Fig. 4B). This unique interaction implies that the central prominence that in other SSB proteins is made by the 4-5 b-hairpins opens up, creating a continuous groove along the dimer longest dimension (Fig. 4B and D). This shallow groove communicates the two transversal channels where ssDNA binds in EcoSSB (Raghunathan et al., 2000). Although the interface between L23 and the 4-5 b-hairpin is mainly hydrophobic in nature, this interaction contributes, on average, eight further hydrogen bonds to the dimer, including possible ionic interactions between residue pairs E33-R64 and E35K68. The actual bonding scheme varies in each case reflecting the flexibility of the structural motifs involved in the interaction, and consistently with the fact that these regions were not completely modelled in some of the monomers (see above). This variability is also observed when we compare the interface surfaces of the dimers. In the three independent dimers found [two in the native structure and one in that of (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2] each monomer buries a surface ranging from 945 Å2 in the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 structure to 1085 Å2 in one of the dimers in the native structure, as reported by the PISA

server at the EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/ pistart.html) (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004). Architecture of the ORF34p2 tetramer The ambiguity observed in solution with respect to the oligomeric state of ORF34p2 is echoed by its crystal forms. Whereas the native structure unequivocally displays a head-to-head tetrameric layout, the (SeMet) M2BORF34p2 structure clearly appears as a dimer. Similarly to other SSB proteins, the ORF34p2 tetramer exhibits pseudo-D2 symmetry (Fig. 4C). However, the principal axes of the two dimers form an angle of ~85°, substantially bigger than the angles found in EcoSSB (~70°) or MtbSSB (~35°) tetramers. This almost orthogonal disposition of the dimers allows them to pack more closely than in other homotetrameric SSB proteins, making the ORF34p2 tetramer the most compact homotetrameric SSB structure described until now. The ORF34p2 tetramer is held together mainly by hydrophobic interactions ensuing from the further 3425 Å2 buried upon its formation. The tetramerization interface, which involves strands 1, 4 and 5 of each monomer, includes only six hydrogen bonds, mostly involving residues at both ends of the well-defined structure, namely T1, T6, Q8, E84 and T89. Contrary to EcoSSB and HmtSSB, there are no ionic interactions to strengthen the tetramer. Therefore, we conclude that under the conditions tested, ORF34p2 can form strong dimers and weak tetramers. Furthermore, a higher-order organization is suggested by the native structure of ORF34p2, where a crystallographic interaction is found between monomers A and C of adjacent tetramers. Each monomer buries ~980 Å2 in this interface, which includes more than 10 hydrogen bonds and a possible salt bridge between E57 in monomer A and R15 in monomer C. This inter-tetrameric interface occludes the putative ssDNA binding groove of monomer C but leaves monomer A free to bind to ssDNA. If, as known for EcoSSB (Lohman and Overman, 1985), ORF34p2 supports different ssDNA binding modes, this tetramer­tetramer interaction could be the basis for one of those putative modes. However, this hypothesis must be tempered by the fact that the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 structure does not show this type of interaction. The structure of ORF34p2 suggests putative ssDNA binding sites The OB-fold proteins tend to use a common ligand binding interface centred on b-strands 2 and 3, with contributions from the L12, L3a and L45 loops (Murzin, 1993). In the case of EcoSSB, this interface is further extended so that the ssDNA binds along the groove defined in each

monomer by the 1-2 and the 4-5 b-hairpins, with further interactions involving the L23 loop and the a-helix. The particular architecture of the ORF34p2 tetramer makes that the clefts expected to direct ssDNA binding form an almost continuous trench that has a positive electrostatic potential (Fig. 4D). Lining this trench, several positively charged and aromatic residues are interspaced that might play a role in ssDNA binding: K12, R15, K21, K24, K34, K36, R64, K68, K85 and Y44, F48, F52, Y73, F80 and F87 respectively. Residues marked in bold italics are conserved, or replaced by an amino-acid of the same type, among the homologues of ORF34p2 in other lactococcal phages (Fig. 1) and thus constitute potential candidates to be involved in ssDNA binding. With a complementary approach, site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent electrophoretic mobility-shift assays performed by Szczepanska and co-workers on Orf14bIL67 have shown that residues V17, K65 and Y70, especially the latter two, are involved in ssDNA binding (Szczepanska et al., 2007). Of these residues, only V17 is conserved in ORF34p2. However, the other two residues would indeed localize in the ssDNA binding groove. Further experiments will be required to determine the actual residues involved in direct interaction with ssDNA. In summary, whereas the crystal structure of ORF34p2 clearly corresponds to that of an SSB protein, this phage protein displays unique traits, notably the compactness and reorganization of the L23 loop and the 4-5 b-hairpin in the monomer and the contacts established between these structural elements in the dimer. These unique features support the notion that lactococcal SSB proteins constitute a new family within the SSB protein superfamily, as has been proposed elsewhere (Szczepanska et al., 2007). Imaging of SSB­ssDNA complexes by atomic force microscopy Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been previously exploited to confirm the capacity of SSB proteins to bind ssDNA, e.g. for coliphage T7 gp2.5 (He et al., 2003) and for EcoSSB (Hamon et al., 2007). Compared with dsDNA, ssDNA is considerably more difficult to image by AFM because it is thinner and forms secondary structures that fold the molecules into complex shapes, or even into blobs (Fig. 5A). To curtail this inconvenience we replaced magnesium with the trivalent cation spermidine in the deposition buffer (Hamon et al., 2007). Spermidine was also efficient in spreading the SSB­ssDNA complexes on the surface at all the protein concentrations used in the experiments presented herein. We titrated the circular coliphage M13 genomic ssDNA with ORF34p2 (Fig. 5). Under our experimental conditions and in the absence of ORF34p2, M13 ssDNA displayed

several regions with secondary structure organization, spaced by extended stretches (Fig. 5B). We did not observe fully extended M13 ssDNA molecules. Incubation of M13 ssDNA with increasing concentrations of ORF34p2 (Fig. 5C­F) resulted in the formation of nucleoprotein complexes that reached saturation at an ORF34p2 : M13 ssDNA molar ratio (R) of 400:1, in full agreement with the EMSA data obtained under very similar experimental conditions (Fig. 3B). In AFM experiments, saturation was established by the appearance of many unbound ORF34P2 particles spread over the mica surface and by the observation of fully coated M13 molecules (Fig. 5F). Under such conditions, the ORF34p2­ ssDNA complexes formed packed `beads-on-a-string' structures that were more extended than the M13 ssDNA alone. However, from inspection of the images, it was clear that the overall contour length of the ORF34p2­ ssDNA nucleoprotein complexes was significantly less than what would be expected for the fully extended ssDNA (Fig. 5E and F). This result strongly indicated that the DNA binding mode of ORF34p2 involves wrapping of the ssDNA around the protein, as anticipated for an SSB protein. The analysis of 30 molecules of M13 ssDNA in the presence of saturating amounts of ORF34p2 (Fig. 5G) showed that, on average, there were about 63 ORF34p2 particles, possibly tetramers, bound to a single M13 ssDNA molecule. Given the size of M13 ssDNA (7249 nt), these data suggest that binding of an ORF34p2 particle to ssDNA involves ~115 nt, either wrapped around the protein or constituting the DNA linker between adjacent particles. Unfortunately, the compact structure of the complexes and the broadening effect of the tip did not permit direct visualization of the DNA linker. On a similar study on EcoSSB (Griffith and Shores, 1985), stretches of about 30 nt protein-free DNA were found. In order to better quantify the length of ssDNA occupied by a single ORF34p2 particle and to determine the degree of DNA compaction consequent to the binding, we performed experiments with a linear ssDNA fragment (1204 nt) obtained by asymmetric PCR. This procedure results in a mixture of single-stranded and doublestranded DNA fragments that can easily be discerned from AFM images because dsDNA is thicker and more extended than ssDNA (data not shown). Figure 5H shows a set of images obtained with this DNA substrate under saturating concentrations of ORF34p2 (R = 400:1). On the one hand, these images show that ORF34p2 does not bind dsDNA, confirming the EMSA experiments. On the other hand, ssDNA fragments were completely covered by ORF34p2 and formed more extended conformations than those observed with M13 ssDNA. In this case, the limited size of the ssDNA fragment allowed a more accurate determination of the nucleoprotein filament contour length and a more precise evaluation of the number of ORF34p2

In particular, in a sample of 170 ORF34p2­ssDNA complexes the average number of SSB tetramers bound to the 1204nt-long ssDNA was 9 0.3, which implies an average SSB nucleo-particle spacing of 134 25 nt.

Indeed, octamers, observed as `beads' by electron microscopy (Chrysogelos and Griffith, 1982), play a

role in the context of the EcoSSB65 binding mode (Lohman and Ferrari, 1994). Further work addressing the ssDNA binding modes of ORF34p2 should elucidate the functions of the different oligomeric states of the protein. Contour length measurements of these 170 ORF34p2­ ssDNA complexes (Fig. 5I) resulted in an average contour length value of 164 4.6 nm. Assuming that the nucleotide step in ssDNA is about 0.6 nm (Murphy et al., 2004), the expected contour length of the 1204-nt-long ssDNA fragment would be 722 nm. Therefore, under in vitro conditions of protein saturation, binding of ORF34p2 results in a ~77% compaction of the ssDNA. ORF34p2 stimulates RecA-mediated homologous recombination in an in vitro strand exchange reaction An important feature of SSB proteins is that they stimulate homologous recombination reactions. Thus, EcoSSB is required to remove secondary structures from ssDNA thereby allowing RecA to efficiently form presynaptic complexes (Kowalczykowski et al., 1987). Similarly, S. cerevisiae RPA (the eukaryotic SSB homologue) does not stimulate Rad51 ATPase activity on ssDNA devoid of secondary structure such as poly(dT), while it can stimulate Rad51 by ~1.4-fold on phiX174 ssDNA (Sugiyama et al., 1998). We therefore addressed the question of whether ORF34p2 could stimulate RecA. First, a titration with RecA was performed (Fig. 6A) on a series of strandexchange reactions. We then kept a limiting concentration of RecA (1 mM) while adding increasing concentrations of ORF34p2. At 1 mM RecA, only 5% of displaced ssDNA were produced. Addition of 3 mM ORF34p2 resulted in a threefold increase in activity compared with RecA alone (Fig. 6B). Therefore, we conclude that ORF34p2, like other SSB proteins, can stimulate homologous recombination mediated by the RecA recombinase. However, we have not determined if this stimulation requires direct interaction of ORF34p2 with RecA, as reported for RPA in S. cerevisiae (Sung, 1997) and SSBs from mycobacteria (Reddy et al., 2001).

Conclusions
Our studies lead to the characterization of ORF34p2 as a bona fide SSB protein. We have shown that ORF34p2 is an early and abundantly expressed protein during phage p2 infection that can bind ssDNA with high affinity, but not dsDNA. AFM experiments have shown that upon binding, ssDNA wraps around ORF34p2, as expected for an SSB protein. The structure of ORF34p2, which we have determined in two different space groups, shows that this protein forms dimers and tetramers structurally similar to those found in bacterial SSB proteins. Furthermore, ORF34p2 can also stimulate RecA-mediated homologous recombination. Finally, these observations are consistent with the genomic context of the orf34p2 gene, downstream a putative single-strand annealing protein named Sak3 (Bouchard and Moineau, 2004). The unique features that we have found in the structure of ORF34p2 strongly back up the idea that lactococcal SSB proteins constitute a new family within the SSB protein superfamily (Szczepanska et al., 2007). In this respect, the structure that we present could serve as a basis to understand the selective advantage for lactococcal phage of expressing their own SSB proteins. Further functional studies on the proteins coded in the same `recombination cassette' than ORF34p2, as well as on their interactions will lead to a better understanding of the implication of lactococcal phage-coded SSB proteins in DNA recombination processes associated with hostphage genetic exchanges and DNA replication.

Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and phage
Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 (Gasson, 1983) was grown at 30°C in M17 supplemented with 0.5% glucose (GM17). Propagation of phage p2 (Moineau et al., 1995) and determination of phage titers were performed as described previously (Emond et al., 1997). In phage assays, GM17 was supplemented with 10 mM calcium chloride (GM17-Ca).

Phage DNA was isolated as reported elsewhere (Deveau et al., 2006).

Molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius determination was performed by ASTRA V software (Wyatt Technology) using a dn/dc value of 0.185 ml g-1.

Cloning, expression and purification of ORF34p2
Phage p2 orf34 gene was amplified by PCR from phage p2 genomic DNA using specific Gateway primers containing attB sequences at both ends, a ribosome binding site and an N-terminal His6-tag coding sequence, and was cloned by recombination in a Gateway pETG-20 A vector kindly provided by Arie Geerlof (EMBL). Due to the lack of methionines in ORF34p2 sequence and in order to introduce selenium for diffraction studies, the orf34 gene was recloned introducing two leucine-to-methionine substitutions: L49M, L55M (M2BORF34p2) using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Protein expression experiments were carried out with the Rosetta (DE3)pLyS (Novagen) strain. After an overnight induction with 1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-beta-Dgalactopyranoside at 25°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 g. Mutant M2B-ORF34p2 was expressed in minimal conditions in presence of selenomethionine. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 40 ml l-1 of culture of lysis buffer (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 300 mM, imidazole 10 mM, pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.25 mg ml-1 lysozyme, 1 mg ml-1 DNAse, 20 mM MgS04 and antiproteases (complete EDTAfree antiproteases, Roche) and frozen at -80°C. After thawing and sonication, lysates were cleared by a 30 min centrifugation at 12 000 g. Overexpressed proteins were purified on a Pharmacia Äkta FPLC by nickel-affinity chromatography (His-Trap 5 ml column, GE Healthcare) using a step gradient of imidazole (at 25 and 250 mM). The N-terminal His6-tag was removed by digestion with TEV protease followed by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, to exclude both the tag peptide and the protease. A final purification step was conducted on a preparative size-exclusion column (Superdex200 HR26/60) equilibrated in 10 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl pH 8.0. In the case of the selenomethionyl (SeMet) M2BORF34p2, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was added to the gel filtration buffer to stabilize the redox state of the protein. Purified proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 ml filtration systems (Millipore) and characterized by SDS-PAGE and trypsin peptide mass fingerprint by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker Autoflex). E. coli RecA was purified as described previously (Eggleston et al., 1997), while E. coli SSB was purchased from Promega.

Phage infection experiments
Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 was grown in GM17-Ca until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.2, then the virulent phage p2 was added at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Samples were taken at 5 min intervals and flash-frozen (-80°C). Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3% SDS, 60 mM DTT, protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) and glass beads (106 mm, Sigma-Aldrich). The mixture was vortexed with a Mini-Beadbeater-8 cell (BioSpec Products) five times for 1 min each. Between treatments, cell suspensions were chilled on ice for 1 min. The lysed culture was centrifuged and the cytoplasmic extracts were dosed by RC DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Then, 350 mg of total protein was precipitated by the methanol/chloroform/water method of Wessel and Flügge (Wessel and Flügge, 1984). Pellets were dried and reconstituted overnight with 450 ml of rehydratation buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 50 mM DTT, 4% CHAPS and traces of bromophenol blue).

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using the Immobiline/polyacrylamide system. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed with 24 cm IPG strips pH 4­7 (GE Healthcare). The reconstituted protein sample (see above) was applied on IPG DryStrips (IPGphor II, Isoelectric Focusing Unit, GE Healthcare) using the in-gel sample rehydration technique according to the manufacturer's instructions. After rehydration at 20°C for 12 h, IEF (50 mA/strip) was conducted at 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, at gradient steps from 1000 to 8000 V for 3 h and then at 8000 V for 6 h 30 min, to reach a total of 60­70 kVh. The temperature was maintained at 20°C. After IEF, each strip was equilibrated for 15 min in 10 ml of equilibration buffer 1 (7 M urea, 1% DTT, 36% glycerol, 2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.8) and then in 10 ml of equilibration buffer 2 (7 M urea, 2.5% iodoacetamide, 36% glycerol, 2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.8) for 15 min. For the second dimension, vertical gradient 10­20% SDS-PAGE was run for about 4 h (17 W gel-1; Ettan DALTsix, GE Healthcare). The gels were stained using Colloidal CBB (0.1% CBB G-250, 20% methanol, 10% ammonium sulphate, 2% ortho-phosphoric acid). Scanning was carried out with an ImageScanner (GE Healthcare) and image analysis was performed using ImageMaster 2D Elite software. Spots were cut out of the gel, digested with trypsin and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at the Centre Protéomique de l'Est du Québec (Quebec city, Quebec, Canada).

Size-exclusion chromatography and light scattering
SEC-MALS/UV/RI experiments were carried out on an Alliance 2695 HPLC system (Waters) using a silica-based KW402.5 column (Shodex) equilibrated in Tris 10 mM, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 at a flow of 0.35 ml min-1. The protein was injected at a concentration of 3 mg ml-1. Detection was achieved by using a triple-angle light-scattering detector (Mini-DAWN TREOS, Wyatt Technology), a quasi-elastic light scattering instrument (Dynapro, Wyatt Technology) and a differential refractometer (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology).

Gel retardation assays
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments with 100 nt ssDNA or 100 bp dsDNA fragments were performed as follows: in a volume of 10 ml binding buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 60 mM NaCl, 1% Tween, 2 mM DTT) 32P-labelled

DNA was added to a final concentration of 100 nM and the solution was incubated for 5 min at 37°C. Either ORF34p2 or E. coli SSB was added to final concentrations of 100, 250, 500 and 1000 nM and the reactions were incubated for other 10 min at 37°C. Complexes were fixed by the addition of 0.2% glutaraldehyde followed by a 15 min incubation at 37°C. The reactions were run onto a 4.2% non-denaturing poly acrylamide gel on 1¥ Tris-Glycine buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 50 mM glycine, pH 8.8). Gels were dried on DE81 filter paper followed by autoradiography. The dsDNA substrate was prepared by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides 100 nt long and by purifying the annealed product on a 10% non-denaturing poly acrylamide gel. The sequence of the 100-mer was 5-GGGCGAATTGGGCCCGACGTCGCAT GCTCCTCTAGACTCGAGGAATTCGGTACCCCGGGTTCG AAATCGATAAGCTTACAGTCTCCATTTAAAGGACAAG-3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments with circular M13 ssDNA (7249 nt long) (Sigma Aldrich) were performed under the same conditions used for AFM experiments. Namely, ORF34p2­ssDNA complexes were assembled using 100 ng of M13 ssDNA (0.5 nM final concentration) and increasing amounts of protein (15, 30, 50, 100, 200, 400 nM) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 50 mM Spermidine. The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37°C and loaded in a 1% agarose gel after addition of a gel loading buffer containing glycerol. Electrophoresis was run at 4°C in TBE buffer at 3 V cm-1. After a 4 h run, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg ml-1) for 60 min.

Surface plasmon resonance
Experiments were performed using a Biacore 1000 instrument (Biacore) at 25°C. The chip streptavidin was first washed with 10 mM NaOH, 1 M NaCl (three times 100 ml at 40 ml min-1) to eliminate loosely bound streptavidin. Biotinylated-DNA 40-mer (ssDNA; 45 mg ml-1) in 10 mM Tris buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.005% (v/v) P20 were fixed as ligand at 550 resonance units). ORF34p2 at concentration from 23 to 375 nM in 10 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.005% (v/v) P20, was used as analyte (80 ml at 10 ml min-1). Regeneration was achieved by injection of 4 M MgCl2 (5 ml at 40 ml min-1). The resonance unit signal at different analyte concentrations was corrected for the buffer contribution in the same flow-cell and for aspecific interactions on the reference flow-cell. The KD values were estimated assuming a 1:1 Langmuir model (BIAevaluation Software).

condition was found to be cryoprotectant, directly flashcooled in liquid nitrogen. Native diffraction data were collected to 2.6 Å resolution at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) on beamline ID23-2. Data were integrated and reduced using MOSFLM and then scaled with the program SCALA from CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994). Diffraction data from a (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 crystal were collected to 2.1 Å resolution at Soleil (Saint-Aubin, Essonne, France) on beamline Proxima 1. These data were integrated using XDS (Kabsch, 1993) and scaled and reduced with the program XSCALE (Kabsch, 1993). The program SHELXD (Uson and Sheldrick, 1999) was used to locate the Se atoms and SHELXE (Sheldrick, 2002) to produce the initial phases. The first model of the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 protein was built using the program ARP-WARP (Cohen et al., 2004). This model was improved by successive cycles of manual rebuilding with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and refinement with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997). The native ORF34p2 structure was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997) using the best defined parts of the (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 structure as the search model. The native model was completed using RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2002), manually rebuilt using COOT and refined with REFMAC5. TLS (Traslation/Libration/Screw) segments (Winn et al., 2001), defined with the help of the TLS Motion Determination server (http://skuld.bmsc.washington. edu/~tlsmd/), were used during refinement. In the native structure, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to all protein backbone at the initial stages of refinement. These restraints were loosened in further refinement cycles and the most flexible loops excluding from them. Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the native model was performed using Molprobity (Lovell et al., 2003). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. All structural figures were prepared with CHIMERA (Pettersen et al., 2004). Atomic co-ordinates and experimental structure factors of native ORF34p2 and (SeMet) M2BORF34p2 have been deposited within the PDB and are accessible under the codes 2WKC and 2WKD respectively.

Atomic force microscopy
ORF34p2­M13 ssDNA complexes were prepared by mixing M13 ssDNA at a final concentration of 0.5 nM in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 20 mM NaCl with increasing concentrations of ORF34p2 protein, from 30 up to 200 nM. Reactions were incubated at 25°C for 5 min and then spermidine (Fluka) was added to a final concentration of 50 mM. Spermidine was used as deposition agent instead of magnesium because it allows a better spreading of the nucleoprotein filaments onto mica (Hamon et al., 2007). A 5 ml droplet of the reaction was deposited onto freshly cleaved ruby mica for 1 min, followed by rinsing with water milliQ (Millipore) and drying with a weak flux of nitrogen. Linear ssDNA fragment (1204 nt long) were obtained by asymmetric PCR using pNEB193 plasmid as a template and an unequal primer concentration. The PCR mixture contained: 20 ng dsDNA template, 25 pmol pNEB-For2 primer, 0.25 pmol pNEB-Rev primer, 50 mM dNTPs (Fermentas), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10¥ PCR buffer and 2.5 U Taq DNA Poly-

Crystallization, data collection, structure determination and refinement
The chromatographic peaks of native ORF34p2 and (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 matching the theoretical molecular weight of a tetramer were concentrated in each case to 7 mg ml-1 and subjected to crystallization screening with a Cartesian nanodrop-dispensing robot (Sulzenbacher et al., 2002). Native ORF34p2 and (SeMet) M2B-ORF34p2 crystals were obtained in 0.1 M Sodium Cacodylate, pH 6.2, 45% MME PEG 2000 and 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.2, 60% MME PEG 550 respectively. In both cases crystals appeared after 3 days and were fished using a nylon loop and, as the crystallization

merase (Fermentas) was thermally cycled for 35 times as follows: 95°C for 60 s, 58°C for 30 s, 72°C for 2 min. The DNA product was purified using PCR Clean-up Nucleospin Extract II (Macherey-Nagel). The AFM images were obtained in air with a Nanoscope III microscope (Digital Instruments) operating in tapping mode. All operations were done at room temperature. Commercial diving board silicon cantilevers (mmasch) were used. The microscope was equipped with a type E scanner (12 mm ¥ 12 mm). Images (512 ¥ 512 pixels) were collected with a scan size of 2 or 4 mm at a scan rate varying between two and four scan lines per second. The AFM images were analysed using software written in Matlab (MathWorks). Contour length measurements of the nucleoprotein filaments were performed as described elsewhere (Rivetti and Codeluppi, 2001). Counting of ORF34p2 particles coating ssDNA was done manually. Only molecules that were completely visible in the image and did not have an ambiguous shape were considered. Data were plotted using Sigma Plot (Systat Software).

Strand exchange
Reactions (10 ml) contained purified circular single-stranded pPB4.3 DNA (15 mM) with the indicated concentrations of E. coli RecA and ORF34p2 in TD buffer (25 mM Tris-Acetate pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 5 U ml-1 phosphocreatine kinase). ORF34p2 was added first to the reaction. After 5 min at 37°C, 32P-end labelled pPB4.3 DNA (400 bp fragment, 1.38 mM) was added and incubation was continued for 90 min. Reaction products were deproteinized by addition of one-fifth volume of stop buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M MgCl2, 3% SDS, 5 mg ml-1 ethidium bromide and 10 mg ml-1 proteinase K) followed by 45 min incubation at 37°C. Labelled DNA products were analysed by electrophoresis through 0.8% TAE agarose gels containing 1 mg ml-1 ethidium bromide, run at 4.3 V cm-1, dried onto DE81 filter paper and visualized by autoradiography.
