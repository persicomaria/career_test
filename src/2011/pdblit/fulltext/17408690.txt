The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of Apaf-1 binds to the CARD of caspase-9 to trigger a proteolytic cascade that leads to apoptotic cell Ê death. We report the crystal structure of the Apaf-1 CARD at 1.3 A resolution, solved in a two-element multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) X-ray diffraction experiment. This CARD adopts a six-helix bundle fold with Greek key topology surrounding an extensive hydrophobic core. This fold, which we call the ``death fold'', is found in other domains that mediate interactions in apoptotic signaling despite very low sequence identity. From a structure-based alignment, we identify conserved patterns that characterize the death fold and its subclasses. Like the Ig-fold, it provides a rigid structural scaffold upon which diverse recognition surfaces are assembled.

Introduction
Apaf-1 is a key regulator of the apoptosis machinery (Nicholls et al. 1991). It triggers the proteolytic cascade by activating caspase-9 (Thornberry & Lazebnik, 1998) in response to a variety of pro-apoptotic signals including oncogene and p53-dependent apoptosis (Fearnhead et al., 1998; Soengas et al., 1999). Apaf-1 binds to and induces autocatalytic processing of caspase-9 in the presence a nucleotide (dATP) and cytochrome c (Li et al., 1997). It is a three-domain protein with an N-terminal CARD (caspase recruitment domain) followed by a putative ATPase domain and Cterminal region containing 12 WD40 repeats (Figure 1(a)) (Zou et al., 1997). The CARD is one of several families of small protein interaction domains identi®ed in proteins involved in programmed cell death. These domains, present in

apoptotic receptors, adaptor molecules, caspases, and inhibitors of apoptosis, provide signaling links between the various proteins in the apoptotic program. In vertebrates these domains have been grouped into three families based on sequence similarity and related functions: CARDs, death effector domains (DEDs), and death domains (DDs). CARDs occur as a single domain of the initiator caspases-9 and 2 as well as molecules that bind to them like Apaf-1 and RAIDD. DEDs often occur as tandem repeats and are found on the initiator caspase-8 proprotein and molecules that bind to it, e.g. FADD. DDs comprise the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of apoptotic cell surface receptors including TNFR, Fas, DR2 and p75 as well as molecules that recognize them, e.g. RAIDD, FADD, TRADD. Proteins containing similar domains have also been identi®ed in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster (Aravind et al., 1999). Here, we report the high-resolution structure of the Apaf-1 CARD. The structure of the Apaf-1 CARD is a tightly packed, rigid six-helix bundle with Greek key topology and an extensive hydrophobic core. This fold is shared with other families of protein interaction domains involved in apoptotic signaling, and we identify conserved structural

and primary sequence features of this ``death fold'' superfami1y. We also identify structural elements that distinguish the CARD, DED and DD families previously separated primarily by sequence characteristics. By analogy to the Ig fold, we suggest that the death fold is likely to be a general module for protein-protein interactions.

Structure determination We expressed the N-terminal 97 amino acid residues of human Apaf-1 (the CARD) as recombinant native and SeMet (selenomethionyl) proteins (Figure 1(a)). The CARD is soluble, and was puri®ed by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel

441 elements enclose a tightly packed hydrophobic core and provide a structural scaffold for potential binding surfaces which includes both hydrophobic and electrostatic patches. The secondary structure of the Apaf-1 CARD is primarily a-helical (Table 2A). The ®rst helix (H1, residues 2-20) is severely kinked at His12, inducing an unusually sharp (77  ) local bend in the helix. This kink is achieved by the intercalation of a water molecule between each of two consecutive main-chain hydrogen bonds (Leu10O Ð Glu14N and Gln11O Ð Ala15N). This hydrogen-bonding network is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds involving the His12 and Gln11 side-chains and a third water molecule (Figure 1(b) and (c)). Since these residues (3-19) have helical f/c angles, each residue is involved in at least one helical hydrogen bond, and only two of the hydrogen bonds are broken; following IUPAC convention, H1 should be considered a single severely kinked helix. The next four helices (H2-H5) are essentially linear (each local helical axis can be ®tted to a line with an Ê r.m.s.d. <0.5 A), although as is common for helices of this length (Kumar & Bansal, 1998), each is signi®cantly curved. Three of these helices have Ncapping hydrogen bonds (H3, H4 and H5), and two (H3 and H4) terminate with one or two i  3 main-chain hydrogen bonds, respectively. The ®nal helix (H6) begins as an a-helix (residues 80-88), proceeds through a sharp (43  ) kink at His88 and continues as a 310-helix (residues 87-91). These individual helices pack together primarily in an antiparallel arrangement. In some cases, speci®cally H2 with H5 and the post-kink portion of H1 (H1b) with H4, these interactions are of the i Æ 4/j Æ 4 type (Chothia et al., 1977) which leads to a more perpendicular interaction (  127  for H2-H5 and   133  for H1b-H4 interactions). Based on criteria developed for four-helix bundles (Harris et al., 1994), this arrangement of helices can be considered a six-helix bundle because each of the helices interacts with at least two neighboring

®ltration, and anion exchange chromatography. Large single crystals (0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.5 mm) were grown by vapor diffusion in the presence of zinc. The crystals are of space group P212121 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected on the SeMet crystals in a twoelement multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) experiment using selenium and zinc, and on the native crystals (Table 1). Five selenium atoms and two zinc ions provided strong phasing power (Table 1), and the experimental electron density maps were of exceptional quality (Figure 1(b)). The CARD structure could be unambiguously built into this experimental map. The structure of this SeMet-substituted protein is isomorphous with the native protein. We have re®ned an atomic model for the native protein which includes the ®rst 92 amino acid residues of Apaf-1, a disul®de-linked b-mercaptoethanol (BME) moiety, ®ve bound zinc atoms, and 114 water molecules to an R-factor of 16.9 % (Rfree 19.9 %) at Ê 1.3 A resolution. While this manuscript was in preparation, a complex of the Apaf-1 CARD and the CARD of Ê caspase-9 was reported at 2.5 A resolution (Qin et al., 1999). This report also included a brief description of an Apaf-1 CARD determined at lower resolution and in a different (monoclinic) space group than the structure we determined independently and report here. Apaf-1 CARD structure The Apaf-1 CARD adopts a tightly packed globular shape, and is comprised of six helices which are arranged like a six-pack of beverage cans. Viewed from the top, these form three stacked pairs of helices (Figure 1(c)). Viewed from the side, the three pairs of helices (H1/H6, H4/H5, and H2/H3) are closer together at the bottom and wider at the top to form a somewhat ``W-shaped'' structure (Figure 1(d)). These secondary structural

Crystals were cryoprotected by quickly immersing them in reservoir solution (native) or supplemented with PEG 8000 to 30 % (w/v) SeMet and ¯ash cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen. MAD data were collected at the X25 beam-line on a B4 CCD detector and the native data were obtained at the X26C beam-line on an ADSC Q4 CCD detector both of which are at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven. Data were integrated and reduced using the HKL package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Initial selenium sites were identi®ed with SOLVE (Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999), phase re®nement was carried out in SHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997) and included zinc sites identi®ed from log-likelihood maps of zinc-peak data. All model building was È done in O (Jones et al., 1991). Initial re®nement against experimental phases was performed in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998), and ®nal re®nement was carried out against the unreduced intensities with SHELX-97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). The two crystal forms are isomorphous except for the ®ve methionine side-chain structures and a partially occupied zinc atom which binds to the N-terminal main-chain in the SeMet but not native crystals. In the data reduction section, values in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell. a Rsym is calculated after merging Friedel pairs. b Ê Ê Rano is calculated after merging symmetry mates. Rmerge between wavelengths is reported for data to 2.08 A (and 1.60 A). c Phasing power is IFH(calc)/phase integrated lack of closure. d FOM is weighted over both F amplitude and phase, both as calculated by SHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997). e Dihedral angles were unrestrained in re®nement and core regions as de®ned by Kleywegt & Jones (1996).

helices and a plane perpendicular to the average helical axis bisects all six helices. The connectivity of the helices in the CARD is that of a Greek key (Figure 1(e)), a topology better known from b-barrel structures such as immunoglubulin folds (Ig folds) (Vaughn & Bjorkman, 1996). Thus the fold of the Apaf-1 CARD is that of an antiparallel six-helix bundle with a Greek key topology. As is typical for Greek key b-barrels, the secondary structural elements of the Apaf-1 CARD surround an extensive hydrophobic core. We de®ned

the central core of the molecule to be residues whose side-chains interact with residues from at least two other helices and are not exposed to solvent because they are at the top or bottom of the helical bundle. This 19 residue central core is comprised exclusively of hydrophobic side-chains (including one tyrosine residue), and include residues from each of the six helices (Figure 1(f)). The initiation methionine residue of Apaf-1 is structured and contributes to this hydrophobic core, as does Leu35 of the loop connecting H2 and H3.

This central core is surrounded by an extensive 38 residue boundary layer. This layer includes additional hydrophobic residues at the helical interfaces around the perimeter of the bundle as well as polar and charged residues, oriented with their aliphatic portions towards the core and their hydrophilic portions towards the periphery. The hydrophobic core of the Apaf-1 CARD provides a structural rigidity to the domain, which is re¯ected in the low average B-factor for the side-chain atoms contributing to the central core and the overÊ all average B-factor of the molecule (21.4 A2 and Ê 25.5 A2, respectively). The surface of the Apaf-1 CARD includes both electrostatic and hydrophobic surfaces (Figure 2) The H1/H4/H3 surface of the CARD is primarily comprised of basic residues (R6, R13, K58, K62, and K42), while the opposite face (H2/H5/H6) is primarily acidic (E40, D27, E78, D32, D66, D64, and D2). In our crystal form these surfaces are packed together and bridged by a fully occupied and tightly packed Zn atom, which bridges the lone acidic residue of the H1/H4/H3 face (E17) and D64 on the opposite face. The loop connecting H2 and H3 includes an isoleucine residue (I37) which projects away from the CARD and highlights a hydrophobic patch (including T36, F34, G33, and I30) at the top of the H2/H3 end of the molecule. A second hydrophobic surface is found near H6 (comprised of V69, F71, L76, L83, A84, A85, L86, I91, and P92). In the crystal structure, these two surfaces also form a lattice contact, which includes another Zn atom bringing E40 and D27 near I37 of one molecule and H88 of the other molecule. It is worth noting that E40 and D27 are also involved in binding the caspase-9 CARD, and mutation of either to alanine eliminates caspase-9 binding (Qin et al., 1999). The six-helix bundle structures are involved in other apoptotic protein interactions In addition to the Apaf-1 CARD, several other apoptotic interaction domain structures have been recently determined and are available in the protein data bank (PDB), e.g. the CARD of RAIDD, the FADD DED, and the DDs from the receptors Fas and p75 (Chou et al., 1998; Eberstadt et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1996; Liepinsh et al., 1997). Although there is very low sequence identity (10-

15 % pairwise), these domains form a family of structurally similar proteins (Holm & Sander, 1993) (Figure 3(a)). Although neither the coordinates of the monoclinic Apaf-1 CARD structure nor the complex of the Apaf-1 and Caspase-9 CARDs are available via the PDB, it is clear from the reported structural similarity that these two CARDs adopt the same fold (Qin et al., 1999). Thus despite the low sequence identities, the CARDs, DEDs and DDs share a common fold composed of six helices packed in an antiparallel six-helix bundle

Helices are indicated by gold boxes for the known structures and represented schematically for helical regions that are conserved among the structures.

Those that comprise the hydrophobic core are underlined. The consensus pattern from sequence-based alignments is shown for the CARD (Hoffmann et al., 1997), DED (Eberstadt et al., 1998) and two sub-types of DD domains (Feinstein et al., 1995), as well as an overall consensus for the death fold. In these consensus patterns, O represents hydrophilic, * hydrophobic, and Á any residue, while conserved amino acids are represented by their one-letter codes. In the DED, a pair of conserved hydrophobic residues at the C terminus of H2 that form a hydrophobic surface on the molecule are represented as XX. (c) Residues that are critical for various death fold interactions are mapped onto the Apaf-1 CARD surface illustrated with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).

architecture with Greek key topology, which we call the death fold. The CARD motif was identi®ed on the basis of a conserved pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (Hoffmann et al., 1997), and similar alignments have been published for the DD (Feinstein et al., 1995) and DED (Eberstadt et al., 1998). By combining these sequence-based alignments using the known structures, we are able to identify a conserved pattern of hydrophobicity common to these death fold domains (Figure 3(b)). Speci®cally, hydrophobic residues, which in the known structures contribute to the core of the domain, are

found with characteristic helical periodicity (4 on H1 and H6, 3 on H2 and H3, and both 3 and 4 on H4 and H5). These hydrophobic residues pack together in a characteristic manner. Helices 4 and 5 contain the most extensive hydrophobic patches and form the center of the helical bundle. Helix 2 is also quite central, as it packs against both H4 (parallel) and H5 (perpendicular). The conserved hydrophobic residues on H1 are located at the C terminus of the helix, which packs perpendicularly around the N-terminal portion of H4. H3 packs against the H2 and H4 surface, while H6 packs against H5 and H1. In addition, each of the

445 RAIDD CARD, and these packing modes result in more perpendicular helical orientations. The long connection between H1 and H2 is achieved either by a kink in H1 (as in Apaf-1 and capase-9) or a connecting hydrophobic loop (RAIDD). H1 is longer in the CARDs than in the DED or DDs, and this extension contributes two or three residues to the hydrophobic core. The central residue in the CARD core is a conserved phenylalanine residue in the middle of H5. In the DD and DED structures the helices pack against each other with additional perpendicular interactions (Table 3B). The long connection between H1 and H2 is achieved by either rotation (FADD) or translation (Fas, p75) of the H2 N terminus towards the H1 C terminus. In the DEDs, there is a long connecting loop between the putative H4 and H5 helices, and in FADD this loop contributes an additional leucine residue to the hydrophobic core. In the DD structures, a loop N-terminal to the ®rst helix takes the place of the longer H1 in the other structures and contributes hydrophobic residues to the core of the domain. In the DED structure the central residue in the hydrophobic core is a phenylalanine residue in the middle of H4, although the corresponding residue is aliphatic in many other DED sequences. In the both DD

domains inserts a hydrophobic residue from the connection between H2 and H3 into its hydrophobic core. Thus, in addition to sharing a fold, the CARDs, DEDs and DDs share a characteristic pattern of hydrophobicity at the primary sequence level. The CARDs, DEDs and DDs are structurally more similar within a class than between classes. Each of the other CARD structures has more structurally comparably residues (588) to the other CARDs than to any of the DED or DD structures (477; Table 3A). Similarly, the two DD structures share more structurally comparable residues (79), than either DID shares with the CARD or the DED structures (477). Thus, although each of these domains adopts the same architecture and fold, the families of CARDs, DEDs and DDs are structurally more similar within a family than between families. Both sequence and structural differences characterize the speci®c differences among these different families of death fold domains. In each of the CARD domains the six helical axes are roughly parallel (Figure 3(a)), with primarily antiparallel inter-helical interactions (Table 3B). In each of the domains, the H2-H5 interaction has antiparallel, i  4 ridge into j  4 groove packing, as does H1-H6 packing in the

Conclusions
This utilization of the death fold (a Greek key six-helix bundle) for protein-protein recognition in apoptotic signal transduction is analogous to the use of the Ig fold (a Greek key b-barrel) in antigenprotein and cell-cell recognition functions. Both the death fold and Ig fold are small ($90 amino acid residues) rigid domains whose secondary structural elements surround a hydrophobic core. In each case there are individual families of domains (CARD, DED, and DD for death fold and V, I, C1, and C2 sets for the Ig fold) which share additional sequence and structural characteristics that are common to the larger superfamily. Both folds occur as speci®c modules that are found as components of multi-domain proteins with a wide range of functions. The prototypical Ig fold interaction (antibodyantigen binding) involves a speci®c portion of the Ig fold (the hypervariable region). However, protein-protein interactions are known to occur at many other surfaces of the Ig fold (Vaughn & Bjorkman, 1996). Presumably this is accomplished because the secondary structure architecture provides a rigid domain enclosing a hydrophobic core, which in turn provides a framework upon which diverse recognition surfaces can be assembled. The death fold is also a rigid domain with a secondary structure architecture enclosing a hydrophobic core and provides a framework for the assembly of diverse recognition surfaces (Figure 3(c)). Indeed, for the complex of the Apaf-1 and caspase-9 CARDs, the principal interactions occur on different surfaces for the two molecules (the middle of the H2-H3 surface for Apaf-1 and the H1 side of the H3/H4/H5 edge of caspase-9) (Qin et al., 1999). The binding site mapped on the FADD DED for its binding partner caspase-8 occurs at a third site, a hydrophobic patch centered around the H2H3 connecting loop on the top of the domain (Eberstadt et al., 1998). For DDs, the binding site on Fas has also been mapped to the H2-H3 loop, while the binding site on TNF-R1 is predicted to include the loop between H3 and H4 (Huang et al., 1996). Thus the death fold architecture, like the Ig fold, provides a structural scaffold upon which diverse recognition surfaces can be assembled. The Ig fold architecture, i.e. that of a Greek key b-barrel, is also seen in proteins which are not members of the Ig superfamily (e.g. superoxide dismutase and ®bronectin type-III repeats). The primary distinction between the multiple families that comprise the Ig superfamily and these other domains, which share the same fold, is that the

Ig superfamily members are believed to share a common ancestor based on a combination of limited sequence similarity and their common folding pattern. The sequences identi®ed as members of the CARD, DED and DD families as well as several invertebrate sequences, which are dif®cult to assign to a particular family, also show weak sequence similarity as well as their common fold, and thus can also be presumed to be homologues (Aravind et al., 1999; Hoffmann et al., 1997). Thus the various adaptors, receptors, proteases, and inhibitors containing CARD, DED, DD and homologous domains can be thought of as a death fold superfamily akin to the Ig-superfamily of cell adhesion, antibody, T-cell receptor, MHC, and other Ig fold-containing molecules.
