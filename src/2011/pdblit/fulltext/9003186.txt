ABSTRACT: The contribution of the conserved His ligand to iron binding in transferrins has been addressed by site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallographic analysis. His 253 in the N-terminal half-molecule of human lactoferrin, LfN (residues 1-333), has been changed to Gly, Ala, Pro, Thr, Leu, Phe, Met, Tyr, Glu, Gln, and Cys by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The proteins have been expressed in baby hamster kidney cells, at high levels, and purified. The results show that the His ligand is essential for the stability of the iron binding site. All of the substitutions destabilized iron binding irrespective of whether the replacements were potential iron ligands or not. Iron was lost below pH 6 for the Cys, Glu, and Tyr mutants and below pH 7 or higher for the others, compared with pH 5.0 for LfN. The destabilization is attributed to both steric and electronic effects. The importance of electronic effects has been shown by the crystal structure of the H253M mutant, which has been determined at an effective resolution of 2.5 Å and refined to a final R factor of 0.173. The iron atom is changed from six-coordinate to five-coordinate; the Met 253 side chain is not bound to iron even though there appears to be no steric barrier. This is attributed to the poorer affinity of the thioether ligand for Fe(III) compared with imidazole nitrogen. The decreased stability of the iron binding is attributed solely to the loss of the His ligand as the protein conformation and interdomain interactions are unchanged.

Proteins of the transferrin family, which include serum transferrin and lactoferrin, play a key role in controlling the levels of free iron in the body fluids of animals [for reviews see Brock (1985), Harris and Aisen (1989), and Baker (1994)]. This is achieved through the existence, in each protein, of the two specific binding sites, each with a high affinity for Fe3+ iron; binding constants are of the order of 1020 M. A general consequence is that the proteins have bacteriostatic properties and also protect against ironcatalyzed free radical formation. In the case of transferrin the bound iron is delivered to cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis (Octave et al., 1983), as a central component of iron metabolism. The nature of the iron binding sites has been revealed by physicochemical and structural studies (Harris & Aisen, 1989; Baker, 1994). Crystal structures of lactoferrin (Anderson et al., 1987, 1989), transferrin (Bailey et al., 1988), and ovotransferrin (Kurokawa et al., 1995) show that in each case the molecule is folded into two lobes, representing its N- and C-terminal halves, and that each lobe houses a single iron binding site buried deep in a cleft between two protein domains. In each iron binding site the ligands are the same, 1 Asp, 2 Tyr, and 1 His, together with a bound CO32- ion. The high affinity of each site for Fe3+ must derive both from

the perfect fit of the Fe3+ and CO32- ions when enclosed by the protein and from the choice of ligands. Three anionic oxygen ligands (one carboxylate from Asp, two phenolate from Tyr) match the 3+ charge of the metal ion, and the 2- charge on the CO32- is matched by positive charge from an arginine side chain and a helix N-terminus (Figure 1). This gives the overall site a formal net charge close to 0. Site-directed mutagenesis provides a means to probe the importance of the various ligands that comprise the standard transferrin iron binding site. Mutagenesis of lactoferrin has shown that loss of the Tyr ligands (when replaced by Ala) severely weakens iron binding, although only when both Tyr's in a site are removed is binding lost completely (Ward et al., 1996). Mutagenesis of both lactoferrin (Faber et al., 1996a) and transferrin (Woodworth et al., 1991; Grossmann et al., 1993) demonstrates that replacement of the Asp ligand (by Ser) also weakens iron binding; again this is not sufficient to abolish binding, and the crystal structure of the lactoferrin Asp 60 Ser mutant shows that a water molecule maintains the iron coordination in place of the Asp side chain (Faber et al., 1996a). The histidine ligand is unusual in that it is the only neutral ligand in the iron coordination sphere. We have chosen to make a series of mutations at this site in order to test the degree to which the His ligand is essential and the consequences of replacing it by a variety of other amino acids. The mutations are made in the context of the N-terminal half-molecule of lactoferrin, LfN, which has previously been expressed and characterized (Day et al., 1992a, 1993) and which also has the advantage of the simplicity of a singlesited molecule. Here we describe a number of mutants of

Nicholson et al. sequencing the DNA inserts. For each mutant the DNA insert was transferred to the expression vector pNUT (Palmiter et al., 1987) using a modification of the method used previously for the wild-type half-molecule, LfN (Day et al., 1992a). The pNUT-LfN construct was modified by removal of a 145 bp SmaI/BglII fragment (encoding residues 250-297) and replacement with a 753 bp SmaI/BglII fragment from M13mp18. The modified pNUT-LfN vector and the M13 DNA construct containing the required mutation at His 253 were digested with SmaI and BglII. The individual digests were mixed at an appropriate ratio and religated. Following transformation, pNUT-LfN clones with the SmaI/BglII insert containing the mutation were identified by examining the size of the fragment released by SmaI/ EcoRI digestion (1.31 versus 1.86 kbp). Expression and Purification. A subset of the His 253 mutants, covering substitutions of a range of amino acid types, was chosen for large-scale expression and purification. In each case the pNUT-LfN mutant plasmid was transfected into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells as before (Day et al., 1992a; Faber et al., 1996a). Transformed cells were selected with 0.5 mM methotrexate, and expression of the mutant protein from these cells was verified by immunoprecipitation and SDS gel electrophoresis. For large-scale production the cells were transferred into roller bottles. The mutant protein was secreted into the growth medium, which was changed daily (150 mL per day) over a period of 10-14 days. Purification from the spent growth medium was by ionexchange chromatography (Day et al., 1992a), giving yields in the order of 10-20 mg/L of medium for the various mutants. Iron Binding. The final pH of the medium from the cell culture was around 5.7-6.0. At this pH some of the mutants were essentially fully saturated with iron (derived from the growth medium), but others were not, some having no iron bound at all. For spectroscopic studies each mutant was therefore dialyzed against 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl, and sufficient 0.01 M ferric nitrilotriacetate solution was added to the protein solution to fully saturate its iron binding capacity. UV-visible spectra in the range 250-820 nm were recorded at room temperature with a Hewlett-Packard HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Iron release as a function of pH was monitored by dialyzing each protein against a series of buffers over the pH range 8.0-2.5 as described previously (Day et al., 1992a). Each solution was maintained for a period of 2 days at the appropriate pH, and the percent saturation with iron was estimated from the visible absorption spectrum, by monitoring the Fe(III)-tyrosine charge transfer band that appears around 450 nm. The precise wavelength of maximum absorption for this band, max, varied from one mutant to another and often also varied with pH. For each mutant, the percent saturation with iron at a given pH was therefore estimated by comparing the absorbance at max (for that pH) with the absorbance of the fully iron-saturated protein. Crystallization. Crystallization experiments were undertaken on mutants in their iron-bound form, after first removing their attached carbohydrate chains enzymatically (Baker et al., 1994). This was to ensure homogeneous species. The crystallization conditions were based on those for the wild-type half-molecule (Day et al., 1992b). Concentrated protein solutions (50-70 mg/mL) in 20 µL microdialysis cells (Cambridge Repetition Engineers) were

His 253 and the crystal structure of the His 253 Met (H253M) mutant. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mutagenesis. A template for mutagenesis was constructed by inserting the 1314 bp SmaI/EcoRI fragment encoding residues 250-688 of the human lactoferrin cDNA into the multiple cloning site of M13mp18. Mutations at His 253 were then created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Zoller & Smith, 1983), using the dut-, ung- procedure to select for the mutant progeny (Kunkel et al., 1987). The mutagenic oligonucleotide chosen was degenerate at the first and second positions of the codon for residue 253 and was either G or C in the third; the sequence NNG/C coded for all possible amino acids at this position. The dioligonucleotide was also designed to ablate the BamHI site in the adjacent multiple cloning site. This allowed an additional selection for the mutant strand by digestion with BamHI following the elongation and ligation reactions. Putative mutant clones were selected on the basis of the ablated BamHI site. Individual mutants were identified by

Crystals were obtained for the Met and Phe mutants, H253M and H253F, under essentially identical conditions, i.e., 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 12% (v/v) 2-propanol. The crystals of H253M were thin square plates, up to 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.05 mm in size, orange-red in color, and heavily overlaid. These proved to be tetragonal, a ) b ) 58.5 Å and c ) 217.9 Å, space group P41212 (or P43212), with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Based on an assumed molecular mass of 37.5 kDa these had a Matthews coefficient (Matthews, 1968) of VM ) 2.49 Å3/Da and a solvent content of 51%. The crystals of H253F were quite different, i.e., colorless needles, 0.2 × 0.03 × 0.03 mm in size. Although too small for X-ray analysis, they appeared to have a trigonal or hexagonal unit cell with approximate dimensions a ) b ) 151.0 Å, c ) 48.5 Å, R ) ) 90°, and  ) 120°. Data Collection. A crystal of the H253M mutant, 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.04 mm in size, carefully cut from a cluster, was used for data collection on an R-Axis IIC image plate detector, using radiation from a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator (Cu KR,  ) 1.5418 Å). Data were collected at room temperature, with the crystal mounted approximately about its unique [c] axis but offset by about 10°. The length of the [c] axis required that a relatively long crystal-todetector distance be used. The result was that the data were essentially complete to 2.5 Å resolution but that higher resolution data were limited to the corners of the image plate. Thus, although the nominal maximum resolution of the data was 2.2 Å, and the high-resolution data contributed to the refinement and the precision of the refined structure, the effective resolution may be closer to 2.5 Å. (Note that the offset of the crystal from a crystal axis helped ensure that the missing high-resolution data were reasonably evenly distributed through reciprocal space.) Data were processed using the supplied R-Axis software (Molecular Structure Corp.). From a total of 40 996 measurements with I > 1.0I, 14 575 unique reflections to a maximum resolution of 2.2 Å were obtained. This represented a data set that was 90% complete to 2.5 Å and 72% complete to 2.2 Å (42% complete in the outer 2.5-2.2 Å shell). The overall merging R for redundant measurements was 0.066, with a multiplicity of 2.8 (merging R 0.215 and multiplicity 1.8 in the outer shell). Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement. The H253M crystals were isomorphous with a tetragonal crystal form originally obtained for the wild-type half-molecule (Day et al., 1992b). The latter was originally assumed to be a metalfree form of the protein, but subsequent crystallographic analysis (Day, 1993) showed that this was not the case; the conformation was "closed", very similar to that of the ironbound form of LfN, with an unidentified species present in the metal binding site. An initial model for the H253M mutant was obtained from the tetragonal wild-type structure, described above. This had been solved by molecular replacement, shown to be in space group P41212 rather than P43213, and refined by restrained least squares to an R factor of 0.211 for all data to 2.3 Å resolution (Day, 1993). To construct the initial model for H253M, all solvent molecules and ions, and the side chains of Asp 60, Tyr 92, Arg 121, Tyr 192, and His 253 (the

binding site ligands) were removed. The space group was also assumed to be P41212, as for the wild-type structure. Least squares refinement of the structure was with TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987). The starting model was subjected first to several rounds of rigid body refinement in which the molecule was treated initially as a single rigid body and then as two separate domains. This reduced the R factor to 0.312 for data in the resolution range 20.0-5.0 Å. Further refinement was by restrained least squares, using TNT with the geometry library of Engh and Huber (1991). A 2Fo Fc electron density map calculated at the start of refinement showed little or no density for residues 1-4 or for residues beyond 311, and the starting model therefore comprised residues 5-311 only. Electron density became visible for residues 312-321 later in the refinement, allowing these to be fitted. Refinement proceeded in a series of rounds of restrained least squares refinement, of 20-30 cycles each, interspersed with model examination and rebuilding on a graphics workstation using FRODO (Jones, 1978). Both 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps were used for model rebuilding. The side chains of Met 253, Asp 60, Tyr 92, Arg 121, and Tyr 192, together with the Fe3+ and CO32ions, were all built into the model when the R factor was 0.28 and were also checked with omit maps later in refinement. B values were all set at 25 Å2 at the start of refinement but were allowed to assume individual isotropic values from R ) 0.28 onward. No restraints were placed on the Fe-ligand bond lengths or angles. No solvent molecules were included in the model until the R factor reached 0.21, and they were then introduced conservatively; solvent molecules were not included unless electron density was present in both 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps (levels 1.00 and 3.00) and they made reasonable geometrical contact with potential partners. All were assumed to be water. The standard bulk solvent model incorporated in TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987) was used throughout the refinement. The final model, comprising 2405 protein atoms (residues 5-321), 1 Fe3+ and 1 CO32- ion, and 113 water molecules, gave an R factor of 0.173 for all data in the resolution range 20.0-2.2 Å (14 537 reflections). The rms deviations from standard bond lengths and angles are 0.016 Å and 1.6°, respectively; other refinement details are in Table 1. In the Ramachandran plot calculated from the final model, 85%

of residues are in the most favorable (, ) regions, as defined in the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). As in the other lactoferrin half-molecule structures, the only outlier is Leu 299, which is the central residue in a classic -turn, and has standard values of around (70, -50°) (Baker & Hubbard, 1984). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Iron Binding. All of the mutants bound iron at pH 8.0 and gave electronic spectra that were broadly similar to the wild-type half-molecule. The visible spectrum is characterized by an absorption peak at a wavelength around 450 nm; this peak arises from a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition, assigned as phenolate  f d (Fe3+) (Gaber et al., 1974); i.e., it reflects the Fe(III)-Tyr interaction. The values of max for the mutants are all lower than for wild-type LfN (Table 2). Only for the Cys and Glu mutants, H253C and H253E, is max close to that of wild type; for all the others it is in the range 420-436 nm, similar to the value for the D60S mutant (434 nm) in which a water molecule replaces the Asp ligand (Faber et al., 1996a). The stability of iron binding is also markedly affected by mutation of His 253, with all of the mutants being significantly less stable to acidic pH than wild-type LfN. The closest to wild type is the Cys mutant which begins to lose iron at a pH around 6.1, compared with 5.0 for LfN under the conditions of our experiment, followed by the Glu and Tyr mutants for which iron release begins at pH values of approximately 6.3 and 6.5, respectively. These three mutants are all species in which the substituted amino acid has the potential to act as an iron ligand. All of the remaining mutants have significantly lower iron stability; these include some for which the substituted amino acid cannot bind to iron (Leu, Phe, Ala, Gly, Pro) but others (Met and Gln) in which it might be predicted to act as a ligand. Typical iron release profiles for some of these mutants are shown in Figure 2. The data suggest that for the Cys and Glu mutants, and possibly also Tyr, the substituted amino acid may act as an iron ligand. Modeling these substitutions on the LfN structure suggests, however, that neither Cys nor Tyr side chains could coordinate to iron without some adjustment of the structure. A Cys side chain is too short for S to approach closer than 3.4 Å from the iron atom without displacement of the polypeptide chain (i.e., small adjustments of the torsion angles are not sufficient). On the other hand, a Tyr side chain is too large to fit without significant adjustments. This

steric misfitting may explain the lower stability of these two mutants. The decreased stability of iron binding of the H253Y mutant mirrors observations made with transferrin, for which the analogous H249Y mutant shows much more rapid iron release than wild type (Zak et al., 1995). In the case of the Glu mutant the carboxyl group could coordinate without any significant structural adjustment; here the lower stability may result from the added negative charge when an anionic ligand (Glu) replaces the neutral His. All of the other mutants show a similar pattern of reduced stability and max in the range 420-436 nm. This suggests that the low value of max may be diagnostic of the loss of a protein ligand, as occurs in the D60S mutant (Faber et al., 1996). It was for this reason that two mutants from the latter group, H253M and H253F, were chosen for crystallization trials; the H253M mutant was of particular interest because Met is a potential iron ligand, and modeling on LfN indicated that its thioether sulfur should be able to approach to at least 2.2 Å from the iron atom (see below), yet it groups with the noncoordinating mutants. Structure of H253M. The overall protein conformation of the H253M mutant is unchanged from that of wild-type LfN. Superposition of the CR atoms of residues 5-310, i.e., the whole molecule apart from a small number of residues at the N- and C-termini, gives an overall rms deviation of 0.31 Å. This implies that even the relative orientations of the two domains are the same as in LfN. It reflects the fact that His 253 does not contribute to interdomain interactions, and its substitution by Met does not signficantly perturb the interdomain region (see below). The close similarity of the domain orientations in the H253M mutant and in wild-type LfN appears to be a molecular property and not a result of crystal packing interactions. This is seen by comparing these two species with other LfN mutants, D60S (Faber et al., 1996a) and R121S and R121E (Faber et al., 1996b). In all these crystal structures the crystal packing contacts involve the same residues, i.e., Arg 27, Arg 28, Arg 30, and Ser 283 on domain 1 and Glu 178, Asn 179, Asp 205, and Asp 220 on domain 2. In spite of this, relative domain orientations can vary considerably, with differences 3.5-7.5° from those in LfN and H253M. The combination of altered domain orientations with conserved intermolecular contacts results in different crystal unit cells. Most striking is the comparison of H253M with D60S. All of the crystal contacts less than 3.3 Å found

for H253M are also found for D60S, but the two domains in D60S are 7.5° more closed and the unit cell is changed from space group P41212 (H253M) to C2 (D60S). As in the other half-molecule structures, the C-terminus is disordered. In LfN, residues 323-327 are in an extended conformation, and no density can be seen for residues 328333; in R121S and R121E no density can be seen beyond Phe 325, and here interpretable density does not continue beyond Gly 321. At the mutation site the most important observation is that the Met side chain is not coordinated to the metal ion; i.e., the iron is five-coordinate rather than six-coordinate. This undoubtedly explains the weakened iron binding and explains why the Met mutant behaves like the other mutants with noncoordinating side chains in place of His, i.e., H253G, H253A, H253P, and H253F. The methionine side chain is extended with torsion angles 1 ) -75.0° and 2 ) 171.0°, which places the S atom 3.68 Å from the metal, too far for even a weak interaction. This seems surprising, since only

small adjustments are required to bring the S atom within bonding distance of the iron atom. A change of the main chain torsion angles (, ) from (-68°, 155°) to (-74°, 158°) and of the side chain torsion angles ( 1, 2) from (-75°, 171°) to (-71°, 166°) would make the Fe-S(253) distance 2.2 Å and introduce no serious steric clashes (all contacts >3.2 Å). The electron density makes it clear, however (Figure 3), that the Met side chain is not coordinated and the iron is five-coordinate. The other Fe-ligand distances, and hydrogen bonds involving the anion, are unchanged from those in the wild-type LfN, within the estimated experimental error of around 0.1-0.15Å (Table 3). Superposition of all the atoms of the binding site except Met 253, i.e., Asp 60, Tyr 92, Thr 117, residues 121-124, and Tyr 192, Fe3+ and CO32- (71 atoms), onto the equivalent atoms of LfN gives an rms deviation of only 0.25 Å. The methionine side chain occupies slightly more space than histidine, but this does not disturb any of the other residues close to it in the interdomain space; Glu 81, Tyr 82, Tyr 92, Tyr 192, Arg 210, Glu 216, and Lys 301 all superimpose closely (rms deviation 0.32 Å), as shown in Figure 4, and the only change is a displacement of the water molecule previously attached to N1 of His 253. Interdomain interactions which help stabilize the closed state are unchanged from those in LfN, implying that it is only the loss of the His ligand that destabilizes the iron binding ability of the mutant. The final model contains 113 solvent molecules, all regarded as water. More than half of these (59) superimpose to within 1.0 Å of solvent molecules located independently in the structure of the wild-type molecule. Of 15 essentially

The water molecules in the large cavity of the interdomain cleft are much less well conserved, however; only 7 out of 16 from LfN are retained within 1.5 Å. These have fewer protein ligands and higher B values, reinforcing the view that the water in this cavity is not well ordered except where it is tied down by protein groups. These latter water molecules do not contribute much to interdomain interactions. OVERALL CONCLUSIONS The results show that the neutral His ligand does contribute materially to the stability of iron binding in lactoferrin and presumably also in other transferrins. When it is replaced by other potential iron ligands such as Glu, Cys, Tyr, and Met, these substitutions are significantly destabilizing. It seems that although iron binding involves a structural transition from an "open" to a "closed" form, and might therefore be expected to show some flexibility, the "closed" state is in fact quite restrictive. The invariance of the His ligand in transferrin iron sites probably reflects both electronic and steric factors. Substitution by Glu is sterically acceptable but appears to be electronically unfavorable (by adding an additional, uncompensated, negative charge in the binding site). Substitution by Met is also sterically acceptable (shown by the identical domain closure of the H253M mutant), but it is an inappropriate ligand (see below). On the other hand, substitution by Cys or Tyr must also introduce some steric problems; modeling suggests that neither can coordinate to iron without some adjustment of the polypeptide chain. Even complete loss of the ligand, however, leaving a five-coordinate iron, as in H253M, does not abolish iron binding at pH values greater than 7, nor does it signficantly change the iron geometry with respect to the other ligands or the domain closure. At first sight it might seem surprising that the Met ligand does not bind to iron in this mutant, when there does not seem to be any steric barrier, but this presumably reflects the lower affinity for the neutral thioether group compared with anionic oxygen ligands or the strong  donor nitrogen of histidine. Methionine is known to be a ligand to the low-spin iron of c-type cytochromes (Mathews, 1985) but is probably a much poorer ligand for the high-spin Fe(III) of transferrins. REFERENCES
