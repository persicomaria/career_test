Abstract The xylanase, BadX, from the alkalophilic Bacillus agaradhaerens was cloned, expressed and studied in comparison to a related family 11 xylanase, BcX, from B. circulans. Despite the alkaline versus neutral conditions under which these bacteria grow, BadX and BcX both exhibit optimal activity near pH 5.6 using the substrate o-nitrophenyl b-xylobioside. Analysis of the bell-shaped activity profile of BadX yielded apparent pKa values of 4.2 and 7.1, assignable to its nucleophile Glu94 and general acid Glu184, respectively. In addition to having an 10-fold higher kcat/Km value with this substrate at pH 6 and 40 °C, BadX has significantly higher thermal stability than BcX under neutral and alkaline conditions. This enhanced stability, rather than a shift in its pH-optimum, may allow BadX to hydrolyze xylan under conditions of elevated temperature and pH. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The use of xylanases is becoming increasingly important in the pulp and paper industry. During the bleaching process, removal of lignin can be facilitated by hydrolysis of xylan, the major component of hemicellulose. Xylanases specifically degrade xylan, thereby allowing the use of significantly smaller amounts of environmentally toxic chlorinated chemicals. Since elevated temperatures and pH are used in the pulping and bleaching process, the ideal xylanase for this purpose should be highly thermostable and active under alkaline solutions.1,2

As summarized in several reviews,2 ­ 4 low-molecular weight xylanases from the family 11 of glycoside hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.8; CAZY database: http://afmb.cnrsmrs.fr/CAZY/index.html)5,6 have been isolated from a plethora of bacteria and fungi, many of which grow under extreme conditions. Remarkably, these enzymes have been reported to exhibit pH optima ranging from 2 to at least 9. Given the highly conserved sequences of these homologous xylanases, as well as their common double-displacement catalytic mechanism,7 this prompts the question as to what factors establish such an apparently dramatic range of pH-dependent enzymatic activities. Previously, we characterized the family 11 xylanase from B. circulans (BcX) and investigated its pH-dependent activity by a combination of kinetic, structural and 13 C NMR studies.8,9 The acidic limb of the bell-shaped pH-activity profile of BcX was assigned to the deprotonation of Glu78 (pKa 4.6), as required to form a

catalytic nucleophile, while the basic limb was assigned to Glu172 (pKa 6.7). This latter group must remain protonated to act as the general acid during the ratelimiting glycosylation step of the hydrolytic reaction followed by this retaining glycosidase. Furthermore, substitution of Asn35 with Asp reduced the pH optimum of BcX from 5.7 to 4.6, combined with an 20% increase in activity.10 A detailed study of this mutant enzyme demonstrated that a reverse protonation mechanism, coupled with the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between Asp35 and Glu172 in the glycosyl-enyzme intermediate, leads to the shift in its pH optimum. In combination with research by several groups,11 ­ 13 this work provided an explanation for the well-established observation that family 11 xylanases with pH optima B 5 have an aspartic acid adjacent to their general acid/base catalytic residue, while those with optima \ 5 have an asparagine. However, no further patterns of sequence conservation have been identified for xylanases with significantly alkaline pH optima. To investigate this question, we turned to the 23 kDa xylanase, BadX, from the alkalophilic Bacillus agaradhaerens. This bacterium, which can be isolated from highly alkaline sources such as soda lakes, produces many glycoside hydrolases that are of interest due to their apparent catalytic activities under conditions of elevated pH.14 For example, a pH-optimum of 7 ­8 towards xylan has been reported for BadX.15 The highresolution tertiary structures of BadX (also referred to as Xyl11) in its glycosyl-enzyme intermediate and product-bound states have been determined, confirming that the enzyme follows a retaining mechanism16,17 with a striking similarity to that observed for BcX.18,19 Here, we present a characterization of BadX in terms of its kinetic behaviour and thermal stability. Consistent with their highly conserved structures, the pH-dependent activity profile of BadX resembles that of BcX, with both xylanases having pH optima near 5.6. However, BadX exhibits dramatically enhanced thermal stability, which may account for its catalytic activity under conditions of elevated pH and temperature.

Fig. 2. Dependence of kcat/Km upon pH for the hydrolysis of ONPX2 at 25 °C by BadX. Fitting (solid line) of the data points (o) yielded apparent pKa values of 4.2 and 7.1. The pH-dependent profile of BcX (dashed line) was calculated using data from Ref. 8.

2.2. pH-Dependent activity The pH-dependence of kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of ONPX2 by BadX follows a bell-shaped curve with an optimum value at pH 5.6 (Fig. 2). Fitting of this curve to the equation for two ionization equilibria yielded apparent pKa values of 4.2 and 7.1 for the acidic and basic limbs, respectively. This behavior is similar to that found previously for BcX,8 with a pH optimum of 5.7 and apparent pKa values of 4.6 and 6.7. 2.3. Thermal stability The stability of BadX and BcX towards thermal denaturation was monitored by CD spectroscopy. As previously noted for BcX, neither protein completely refolds reversibly after thermal or denaturant-induced unfolding under a wide variety of buffering conditions.20 ­ 22

2. Results 2.1. kcat and Km values of BadX The Michaelis­Menten kinetic parameters, kcat and Km, were determined for BadX at pH 6.0 and 40 °C to be 16.9 s - 1 and 2.6 mM, respectively, using the synthetic substrate o-nitrophenyl b-xylobioside, ONPX2 (Fig. 1). By comparison, values of 7.1 s - 1 and 14.6 mM (which agree with those previously reported20) were determined for BcX under identical conditions. Thus BadX exhibits an 10-fold greater second-order rate constant, kcat/ Km, than BcX towards this defined substrate.

Therefore, data reported in Fig. 3 reflect apparent midpoint unfolding temperatures and, while a reliable monitor of relative stability, do not allow calculations of reversible thermodynamic parameters. At pH 2.0, both BadX and BcX are partially unfolded or aggregated, as evident by their broad thermal transitions (not shown). At pH 4 and above, BadX consistently denatures 6 to 20 °C higher than BcX, and the addition of 100 mM NaCl does not markedly change this pattern. Similar unfolding temperatures were measured for BcX by calorimetry.21 2.4. Irreversible denaturation As a complementary approach towards thermal unfolding studies, the resistance of each xylanase towards

irreversible loss of activity was measured by incubation at 55 °C and pH 6.0, 8.0 or 10.0, followed by quenching on ice and assaying at pH 6.0 and 20 °C. As summarized in Fig. 4, BadX retains \ 80% of its activity after incubation for 6 min under these conditions, whereas BcX is irreversibly inactivated at a rapid rate that increases with pH.

3. Discussion 3.1. Enzymatic activity Through a combination of increased kcat and decreased Km values, BadX exhibits 10-fold higher activity (kcat/Km) towards a defined xylobioside substrate than

mdoes BcX. This small, albeit significant, effect must arise through subtle differences between these two xylanases, as the residues composing their active site clefts are highly conserved in both sequence and structural arrangement (e.g., comparing Protein Data Bank coordinate files 1QH7/1XNB, 1HYG/1BVV and 1HYH/ 1XNA for the free, covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate and mutant product complexes of BadX/ BcX, respectively). One interesting exception to this sequence conservation is the functional substitution of Tyr166 in BcX by a Glu178-Arg49 ion pair in BadX. In the case of BcX, Gln7 and Tyr166 hydrogen bond to O2 and O3 of the xylosyl group in the -2 subsite of the substrate binding cleft, whereas with BadX, Glu17 and Arg49 complete these interactions.17,18 This latter network of charged hydrogen bonds could result in the fivefold lower Km value measured for BadX than BcX towards ONPX2. The pH-dependent activity profiles of BadX and BcX are comparable (Fig. 2), with both enzymes having pH-optima near 5.6. Based on the homologous structures and common catalytic mechanisms of the two family 11 xylanases, we assign the gain in activity of BadX with increasing pH to the deprotonation of the nucleophile Glu94 (pKa 4.2) and the subsequent loss of activity to that of the general acid Glu184 (pKa 7.1). The similarity of these apparent pKa values with those of 4.6 and 6.7 measured previously for BcX8 is consistent with the strict conservation of the residues immediately surrounding the two catalytic glutamic acids. These amino acids, which include Asn35, Tyr69, Tyr80, Arg112 and Gln127, have been shown by mutagenesis to help establish the precise pKa values of Glu78 and Glu172 in BcX.9 Electrostatic calculations9 also predict that the Glu94 and Glu184 in BadX have comparable values to those of their counterparts in BcX (not shown). Previously, a pH optimum between 7 and 8 was reported for a crude preparation of BadX towards a dyed xylan substrate.15 The discrepancy with the results of this current study may arise from several sources, such as their use of a partially purified bacterial extract, which may contain additional glycosidase activities, or the use of a complex substrate, which itself may have pH-dependent properties. Interestingly, the family 11 xylanase XylJ from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 41M-1 has also been reported to have a very broad pH-dependent activity profile towards xylan with a pH optimum at 9.23 Based on the hydrolytic mechanism employed by these retaining xylanases, this would require that a catalytic glutamic acid residue in XylJ has a remarkable pKa \9 in order to serve as a general acid. Given that BadX and XylJ are highly homologous, with 95% sequence similarity across their catalytic domains24 and no significant amino acid substitutions near their active site clefts, it remains to be established as to what

features, if any, contribute to this reported high pH activity. 3.2. Thermal stability In contrast to their comparable enzymatic properties, BadX is significantly more stable than BcX, as demonstrated by both thermal unfolding studies and by kinetic measurements of irreversible enzyme inactivation. This enhanced stability may arise from several sources. First, BadX (206 residues) contains two small N-terminal b-strands, as well as an internal a-helical turn and C-terminal b-hairpin25 not present in BcX (185 residues). The potential importance of the former feature is highlighted by the enhanced stability of the mesophilic Streptomyces li6idans xylanase B resulting from exchange via gene shuffling of the N-terminal sequence from the thermophilic Thermomonospora fusca xylanase A,26 and by the stabilization of BcX upon fusion to the N-terminal sequence of this T. fusca enzyme.27 On a more precise level, mutation of Thr11 to Tyr in the mesophilic Streptomyces sp. S38 xylanase led to its enhanced stability, possibly by formation of a favourable perpendicular aromatic­aromatic ring interaction with Tyr16.28 Such an interaction is seen in the crystal structure of the thermophilic Thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase29 and in a model of T. fusca xylanase A.28 Interestingly, this potentially-stabilizing aromatic­aromatic interaction, which bridges a conserved Type I' turn found in family 11 xylanases containing the extra N-terminal b-strand(s), may be replaced functionally in BadX by a weakly hydrogenbonded Asn-Asp pair. Second, in addition to having several distinct features including an amide aromatic hydrogen bond,30 a buried His residue adjacent to a bound internal water molecule,31 and a buried Asp-Arg ion pair32 characterized previously in BcX, BadX has three additional ionizable residues in solvent-inaccessible environments: Lys50, His60 and Glu178. Of these, the first is hydrogen-bonded to a presumably neutral His11, whereas the latter two form ion pairs with Glu167 and Arg49, respectively. Such electrostatic interactions within the low dielectric interior of a protein can contribute significantly to the specificity and stability of its folded state. In addition to such defined and experimentally testable interactions, the enhanced stability of BadX relative to BcX may also arise from changes in overall amino acid composition. In a recent structural genomics-based comparison of homologous proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms, several global trends were correlated with elevated stability, such as an increased number of salt bridges and a greater number of charged amino acid residues, yet smaller number of polar non-charged residues, in exposed surface regions.33 These trends are followed in the case of

BadX, with 17.4% of its total amino acids being ionizable (vs. 12.4% in BcX), and of its exposed side chains, 25% are charged (vs. 16% in BcX) and 49% are polar (vs. 55% in BcX). 3.3. Summary The mode of action of many xylanases requires that they be secreted extracellularly. The fact that B. agaradhaerens grows in alkaline environment14 prompts the question as to how BadX may function under conditions of high pH, either found naturally or used in industrial processes such as the pre-treatment of pulp.15 Our studies reveal that, despite its source, this enzyme has a pH optimum at 5.6 and thus does not exploit any specific electrostatic mechanisms to significantly elevate the pKa values of its catalytic residues beyond that found for related family 11 xylanases such as BcX. Based on its measured pH-activity profile, BadX retains 10% and 0.1% of its maximal activity at pH 8 and 10, respectively. Combined with an Arrhenius-type increase in reaction rates with temperature, this level of activity may still allow the thermally stable BadX to adequately catalyze the hydrolysis of xylan under extreme natural or industrial conditions.

4. Experimental 4.1. General ONPX2 was synthesized according to published procedures.34,35 All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise stated. 4.2. Molecular biology, enzyme expression and purification The gene for BadX (Genbank accession A68006) was cloned by PCR methods from B. agaradhaerens AC13 (ATCC strain c 700163; cultured in 0.5% peptone, 0.3% yeast extract and 0.5% NaCl at pH 9.7 and 30 oC) into the Nco1 and Nhe1 restriction sites of the pET28 vector (Stratagene). The resulting construct encoded an N-terminal metal affinity tag and thrombin cleavage site (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMASA) followed by residues Ile2 through Ser207 of the BadX catalytic domain. The sequence and numbering scheme corresponds exactly to that of the BadX construct (also referred to as Xyl11) used to obtain the Protein Data Bank co-ordinate file 1QH7.16,17 Absent from the predicted sequence of the full-length protein are an N-terminal secretory leader sequence and a disordered 14 residue C-terminal extension.


BadX was prepared starting with a 25 mL overnight culture of the transformed E. coli, grown at 37 °C in LB media with 35 mg/L of kanamycin. An aliquot (10 mL) of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of LB media containing 35 mg/L of kanamycin, and the cells were grown with shaking at 37 °C to an optical density (OD600) between 0.5 and 1.0. Protein expression was induced with 0.75 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside followed by growth at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10 min) and re-suspended in 30 mL of nickel column binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol at pH 7.5) and 25 mg (1/4 tablet) of CompleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The resultant cellular suspension was then passed through a French-press cell at 10,000 psi and sonicated for 10 min to ensure complete lysis. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 h, the BadX was purified by nickel affinity chromatography using the above nickel column buffers with 5 mM imidazole for binding, 60 mM imidazole for washing and 250 mM imidazole for elution. The Histag on BadX was cleaved by thrombin (Roche) during an overnight dialysis into 10 mM sodium phosphate at 4 °C and pH 6. The thrombin was inactivated by the addition of p-aminobenzamidine immobilized on crosslinked 4% beaded agarose, and the free His-tag as well as any uncleaved protein was removed via passage over a nickel column. The resultant purified BadX was concentrated using a 3 kDa nominal cut-off stirred ultrafiltration cell (Amicon Corp.) and exchanged into a final buffer of 10 mM sodium phosphate at pH 6. The protein had a molecular weight of 23,673 Da measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This agrees with the predicted value of 23,665 Da for residues 2­207 of the catalytic domain of BadX, plus an N-terminal extension of GSHMASA remaining after thrombin cleavage of the affinity tag. The enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a predicted value of m280nm = 56,470 M - 1 cm - 1 (ExPASy website: http://ca.expasy.org/tools/protparref.html).36 The expression and purification of BcX were performed according to published protocols.10,37 The sequence and numbering scheme is that of the Protein Data Bank coordinate file 1XNB.18,19 4.3. Steady-state enzyme kinetics All spectrophotometric experiments were performed using 1 cm pathlength micro quartz cuvettes with a Unicam 8700 UV­Vis spectrophotometer equipped with a circulating water bath. The determination of the Michaelis­Menten steady-state parameters kcat and Km of both BadX and BcX and the pH-dependence of BadX were performed according to published protocols.10 The hydrolysis of ONPX2 and the release of the

nitrophenyl chromophore was monitored at 400 nm while the steady-state kinetic data were fitted using the program GraFit.38 kcat and Km values were determined using 20 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 50 mM NaCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at pH 6 and 40 °C. BadX at 1.5 ×10 - 4 mM was used in the assay and the ONPX2 concentration varied from 0.1 to 12×Km. The pH-dependence studies were performed at 25 °C with 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA and 20 mM succinic acid (pH 3.0­ 4.5), 20 mM MES (pH 5.0 ­ 6.5), 20 mM (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N%-[2ethanesulfonic acid]) (HEPES) (pH 7.0­ 8.0) or 20 mM 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES) (pH 8.5 ­ 9.0) using 9.3× 10 - 2 mM of ONPX2 with a final BadX concentration of 3.0 × 10 - 3 mM such that ] 80% of the substrate was depleted. The experimental data were fitted to a pseudo-first-order expression, which upon division by the enzyme concentration yielded kcat/Km values. These kcat/Km values were then fitted against a bell-shaped activity profile. An error in the derived pKa values of 90.1 units is estimated from the error in pH measurements. 4.4. Circular dichroism spectroscopy Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a JASCO PFD-425S Peltier heater and a circulating water bath. A 2 mm pathlength cell containing protein at a concentration of 0.25 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate with and without NaCl was used. Thermal unfolding was monitored at 219 nm using a heating rate of 1 °C/min. 4.5. Irreversible inactivation BadX and BcX were incubated at 55 °C and pH 6, 8 or 10 in 10 mM sodium phosphate from 0 to 360 s, and aliquots of enzyme were removed at designated time intervals and quenched in ice-cold Eppendorf tubes. When warmed back to room temperature, 20 mL of BadX (final concentration of 3.2 × 10 - 3 mM) and 10 mL of BcX (final concentration of 2.9 × 10 - 3 mM) were assayed with 0.093 mM ONPX2 in 20 mM MES, 50 mM NaCl and 0.1% BSA at pH 6.0 and 20 °C to ascertain residual kcat/Km as a function of incubation time. Data were normalized versus the activity measured before incubation.
