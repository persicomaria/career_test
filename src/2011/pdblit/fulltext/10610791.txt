The structure of oxidized flavodoxin from the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans has been determined at 2"5 A resolution with phases calculated from ethylmercury phosphate and dimercuriacetate derivatives. The determination of partial sequences, including a total of 85 residues, has assisted in the interpretation of the electron density. Preliminary refinement of a partial model (1072 atoms) has reduced R to 0"349 for the 10,997 reflections between 2"0 and 5"0 A with I > 2a. The polypeptide backbone, which comprises 167 residues in the current model, adopts the familiar fl-c~-flconformation found in other flavodoxins and in the nucleotide-binding domains of the pyridine-nucleotide dehydrogenases, with five parallel strands in the central sheet. Comparison with flavodoxin from Clostridium MP (138 residues) shows that extra residues of A. nidulans flavodoxin are accommodated in a major insertion about 20 residues in length, which" forms a lobe adjacent to the fifth strand of parallel sheet, and in additions to several external segments. Residues added between the fourth sheet strand and the start of the third helix alter the environment of the pyrimidine end of the fiavin mononucleotide ring. The flavin mononucleotide phosphate binds to the start of helix 1, interacting with hydroxyamino acids and with main-chain amide groups. Two hydrophobic residues, both tentatively identified as Trp, enclose the isoalloxazine ring; the solvent-exposed Trp is nearly parallel to the fiavin ring.

The flavin ring is tilted relative to its orientation in Clostridium MP flavodoxin. In addition, atoms N-3 and 0-2~ of the isoalloxazine appear to form hydrogen bonds to the backbone at C097 and NH99 in a conformation entirely different from that found in Clostridium MP flavodoxin but structurally analogous to Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin.
1. I n t r o d u c t i o n

Flavodoxins from diverse species of micro-organisms vary in molecular weight from about 15,000 to 23,000. The oxidation-reduction potentials of this family of proteins differ from those of free flavin mononucleotide by as much as 0"27 V, with the magnitude of the perturbation being ~dependent on the species (Mayhew & Ludwig, 1975). The two known structures, from Clostridium M P (Burnett et al., 1974; Smith et al., 1977), and from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Watenpaugh et al., 1973,1976), are both representatives of the shorter chain flavodoxins, with 138 and 148 residues, respectively, and both display oxidized/semiquinone potentials higher than the corresponding potential for free FMNt. Nevertheless, the conformations of these molecules in the vicinity of the bound FMN differ surprisingly. Flavodoxin from the cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) Anacystis nidulans is a longer chain of about 180 residues (Smillie, 1965; Smillie & Entsch, 1971) with an oxidized/semiquinone potential (-0-221 V at pH 7 (Entsch & Smillie, 1972)) nearly equal to that of free FMN. Structure analysis of this flavodoxin, also called phytoflavin, offers an opportunity to examine further variations in folding and in the mechanisms for modulation of redox potentials. Our initial observation (Smith et al., 1975) that reduction of the crystals to the semiquinone and fully reduced forms was accompanied by minimal changes in the diffraction patterns suggested that comparison of the oxidation states might be more straightforward for algal than for the other flavodoxins, where the analysis has been complicated by non-isomorphism produced by reduction to the semiquinone state (Smith et al., 1977; Ludwig et al., 1976; Watenpaugh et al., 1976). This paper describes the determination of the structure of oxidized A. nidulans flavodoxin by isomorphous replacement at a resolution of 2"5 A, and the subsequent adjustments of atomic positions, which have led to a model containing 1072 atoms$, with a crystallographic R = 0"349 for data between 2.0 and 5"0 A. Comparison witch flavodoxin from Clostridium M P shows that the extra residues of A. nidulans flavodoxin are added to the basic nucleotide-binding fold by lengthening several of the external segments connecting helices with sheet strands, and by formation of a small lobe, which packs against sheet strand 5 and helix 3 (cf. Fig. 1). Amino acid insertions and variations, relative to Clostridium M P flavodoxin, change the protein/isoalloxazine orientation and alter the protein-FMN interactions, particularly at the 0-2~, N-3 and 0-4~ atoms of the t Abbreviations used: FMN, flavin mononucleotide;PTH, phenylthiohydantoin. :[:The composition reported by Smillie & Entsch (1971) predicts 1464 non-hydrogenatoms (180 residues), but in our calculationswe have used 1375, a number more consistentwith the chain length observed in the electrondensity map.

2. M e t h o d s

(a) Amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequencing methods The carboxymethyl derivative of A. nidulans flavodoxin was prepared as described (Tanaka et al., 1977). For determination of the amino-terminal sequence, carboxymethylflavodoxin (200 nmol) was analyzed twice in a Beckman-Spinco model 890 protein sequencer using the protein double-cleavage program and 0"2 M-Quadrol (Beckman) as the coupling buffer. The phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of the amino acids were identified by combinations of the following 3 methods: (A) gas chromatography in a Beckman GC-45 gas chromatograph as described by Pisano & Bronzert (1969); (B) thin-layer chromatography as described by Edman & Begg (1967); and (C) amino acid analysis of the 6 M-HCI hydrolysates of the PTH-amino acids as described by van Orden & Carpenter (1964). In determination of the flavodoxin sequence, procedures for the identification and measurement of specific PTHamino acids were chosen as follows. (1) PTH-threonine and PTH-serine were determined by methods (A) and (B); (2) PTH-glycine, PTH-alanine, PTH-proline, PTH-valine, PTHisoleucine, PTH-leucine and PTH-phenylalanine were determined by methods (A) and (C); (3) PTH-aspartic acid, PTH-asparagine, PTH-glutamic acid and PTH-tyrosine were determined by methods (B) and (C); and (4) PTH-lysine was determined by method (C). Serines 42 and 54 were determined only by method (A). For carboxyl-terminal sequencing, carboxymethylflavodoxin was analyzed by hydrazinolysis (Bradbury, 1958) and by digestion with carboxypeptidase A followed by hydrazinolysis (Ambler, 1972a,b). (b) Crystallization and derivative preparation A. nidulans was grown for us by Dr H. L. Crespi at Argonne National Laboratory. Flavodoxin was isolated from the lyophilized cells following the procedures described by Smillie (1965) and Smillie & Entsch (1971). Crystals employed for intensity measurements were grown in a nitrogen atmosphere from solutions of the semiquinone form by dialysis versus 2"6 to 2"8 M-ammonium sulfate (pH 6"8) (Ludwig et al., 1969), and were subsequently oxidized by exposure to air-saturated buffer. A. nidulans flavodoxin crystallizes in space group P2t2121 with a =57"08 A, b =69"24 A and c =45"55 A, and 1 molecule per asymmetric unit (Smith et al., 1975). For derivative preparation, oxidized crystals were first transferred to saturated lithium sulfate, 0-1 M-HEPES (pH 6-8) in a stepwise fashion during several days. Derivatives were obtained by soaking these crystals for 2 to 3 days in 3 mM-ethylmereury phosphate or 3 mM-dimercuriaeetate dissolved in the buffered lithium sulfate solution. X-ray intensities were measured with Syntex P i and P21 diffractome!ters at 5°C using a modified omega scan procedure. The native data set at 2"0 A resolution (12,717 reflections) consisted of scaled measurements from 2 crystals. Data from individual crystals of each derivative, including Friedel pairs, were collected to 2-5 A resolution (6477 reflections). Data processing has been described (Burnett et al., 1974). (c) Phasing and heavy-atom refinement Examination of difference Patterson maps revealed one binding site for ethylmercury phosphate and one site (2 Hg positions) for dimercuriacetate. Heavy-atom parameters were refined and phases calculated with programs based on the methods of Muirhead et al. (1967) and Dickerson et al. (1968). Phases from the refined parameters for the major sites had an average figure of merit of 0-625. Residual maps displayed a second binding locus for each mercurial, and further cycles of phasing and refinement led to the heavy-atom parameters

U n f o r t u n a t e l y , the major site in the e t h y l m e r c u r y phosphate derivative lies near the pseudo-special position x = 1/4, y = 1/8. An atom at this position in space group P212~2 a does n o t contribute to reflections where k = 4n and l is odd, or where k = 4 n + l a n d l is even. Consequently, the principal e t h y l m e r c u r y phosphate site provides almost no phase information for one-quarter of the reflections.

The presence of fl-n-fl superstructures was obvious on inspection of the electron density, b u t the fl-~ connections a n d the folding of the inserted region had to be established. The most reasonable helixsheet connections led to the same topology (Richardson, 1977) found in flavodoxins from Clostridium M P ( B u r n e t t et al., 1974) a n d D. vulgaris ( W a t e n p a u g h et al., 1973); the e x t r a lobe could be connected only as a n insertion in the 5th s t r a n d of parallel sheet (Fig. 1). The first atomic model was constructed b y a c o m b i n a t i o n of methods, at a stage when only the N-terminal sequence of 55 residues had been determined. The F M N a n d its surroundings (residues in the fl-a connecting segments 8 to 15, 56 to 64 and 85 to 100) were built in a Richards' box (Richards, 1968) on a scale of 2 cm/A; the model was displayed on

the MMS-X graphics system at Wayne State University and adjusted slightly. The surface chain connections at positions 39 to 50, 73 to 82 and 108 to 115 were similarly constructed and inspected. Examination of these 6 portions of the molecule confirmed the helix-sheet connections deduced from minimaps. The N and C-terminal helices and the first 4 strands of the parallel sheet were built using the graphics system; in regions where the sequence was not known, side-chains were not extended beyond C~ except for a few aromatic residues. Backbone and Cp co-ordinates for the major insertion, residues 120 to 139, for residues 67 to 72, and for the segment leading into the final helix were estimated from maps at a scale of 1 cm/A. The approximate positions were adjusted by model-building (Hermans & McQueen, 1974), the resulting co-ordinates were plotted, and atoms were moved into the density manually or by Fourier refinement. This procedure was repeated until a reasonable fit had been achieved (Sprang & Fletterick, 1979).

(e) Phase combination In an effort to compensate for the loss of phasing information resulting from the pseudospecial position of ethylmercury phosphate, we combined partial structure factors with the isomorphous phase profiles (Hendrickson & Lattman, 1970). For the first cycle of phase combination, F¢ values were based on the co-ordinates of 627 atoms. Approximately 300 of these were from the known sequence, residues 1 to 55. The remainder included the FMN and the backbone and partial side-chains of residues 58 to 66 and 72 to 115. Structure factors were computed using the programs described by Burnett & Nordman (1975) and Hoard & Nordman (1979). Generation of phase profiles and combination of phases were carried out with programs generously provided by Wayne Hendrickson. In determining weights according to Sim's (1959) formula, the scale applied to ]Fc] included a factor v/i, wheref is the fraction of the total scattering represented by the atoms included in F~. Phase combination using Fc for data from 8'0 to 2"5 ~ increased the overall figure of merit from 0"748 to 0"811. In maps calculated with combined phases, several regions not included in the model showed changes that appeared to simplify their interpretation, even though the phases were predominantly determined by the heavy atoms (r.m.s. change in phase = 37 ° when calculated phases were given half the weight of multiple isomorphous replacement phases).
(f) Group refinement and inclusion of the sequence 103 to 124 Restrained group least-squares refinement (Hoard & Nordman, 1979) was then employed to adjust the partial model, using data from 2"0 to 5"0 A (Table 3). For refinement, we started with as many atoms as could be positioned reasonably in the density of multiple isomorphous replacement and combined maps. The only residues omitted entirely were 27 to 29, 82 to 83 and 67 to 70. The molecule was divided into groups in a way that allowed peptide and side-chain torsions (Hoard & Nordman, 1979). At the beginning of the refinement, the restraints that maintain connectivity between groups (Hoard & Nordman, 1979; Sussman et al., 1977} were deliberately relaxed; sigma values were 0"25 and 0"50 A for bond distances and angles, respectively. The scale factor applied to IFJ was set by multiplying XIFol/ZIFcI by x/~, where f was the fraction of atoms in the model relative to the total estimated from amino acid analysis, and was not altered during a given cycle. All reflections with I > 2a were included, with unit weights. (Further details of the refinement will be published elsewhere.) After 2 cycles (R =0"397) we compared combined maps and 2 F o - F c maps and concluded that combined maps were preferable for identification of side-chains and manual adjustment of the model. A map, calculated with combined phases to 2"5 ~- and Simweighted model phases (Sim, 1959) from 2-5 to 2"0 A, was used to locate and build the sequence determined by Tarr (Appendix). The unusual tetrapeptide Tyr-Trp-Pro-Ile did not correspond to the density at any of the Trp positions (57, 66 or 94) already assigned in isomorphous or combined maps, but -it could be accommodated as part of the major insertion at positions 119 to 122. Residue 120 had not been identified as Trp because the

Once this tetrapeptide had been found, the first 21 side-chains of the sequence were positioned without difficulty. The sequence began near the midpoint of helix 3 and followed the original chain tracing into the major insertion to residue 123. The fitting of residues 124 to 127, well inside the insertion, required rebuilding of the main-chain. Residues 119 to 122 are in contact with the 50s region of a neighboring molecule, related by a 21 axis parallel to a. The ring of T y r l l 9 was assigned to density which we had previously thought could be a side-chain of residue 59. Identification of T y r l l 9 thus led us to delete one residue, just beyond position 57, from the model of Ludwig et al. (1982). Additional cycles of refinement reduced R to 0-358 (Table3). 2Fo-F¢ maps, with appropriate atoms removed from the phasing model ("deletion" or "fragment" maps) in this region beyond residue 123 indicated t h a t residues 124 to 134 should be rebuilt. The revisea section of polypeptide was then refined (Table 3). The model with R = 0"349 (Table 3, line 9) will provide initial co-ordinates for more complete refinement of the structure. Residues 27 to 29, 67 to 70, 82 to 83, and m a n y of the side-chain atoms of the sequences 71 to 101 and 129 to 167 are missing from this 1072 atom model. I n Fo ~¢ or 2Fo-F c maps (2-0 to 8"0 A resolution) the definition of a number of side-chains is adequate to permit their tentative identification. Refinement and revision of the structure will be carried out in conjunction with the sequencing of peptide fragments (ef. Appendix). The co-ordinates used in the Figures were obtained from the p a r t l y refined structure b y model-building (Hermans & McQueen, 1974), as indicated in the final entry of Table 3, and have been deposited in the Protein D a t a Bank.

Fie. 2. Partial sequences of flavodoxin from A . nidulans, including residues 1 to 55 and the C terminus (capitalized). The assignment of Trp at position 57 is based on the electron density. Equivalent residues in the N-terminal portion of flavodoxin from Clostridium M P (Tanaka et al., 1974) are aligned beneath the sequence of A. nidulans flavodoxin. Because of a deletion in A. nidulans flavodoxin, residues 28 and 29 (in parentheses) of Clostridium M P flavodoxin have no close structural equivalents when the 2 chains are superimposed. The 3-dimensional equivalences are similarly imperfect for A. nidulans residues 36 to 46 (cf. Fig. 4).

several of these h a v e been identified as hydrophobic residues b y sequence analysis (see the Appendix). The amino-terminal portion of the model was positioned unequivocally with the aid of the chemical sequence (Fig. 2). Figure 3 illustrates the excellent definition of side-chains in the fll s t r a n d ; altogether 41 of the initial 55 side-chains were recognizable f r o m their densities. Phe25, Leu44, Leu50, Ile52 and Pro55 provided especially clear m a r k e r s to confirm the n u m b e r i n g of the N - t e r m i n a l position of the molecule.

Fro. 3. A stereo view of the electron density (2"5/~ resolution) and the molecular model in the Nterminal strand of fl-sheet. Phases were determined by combining calculated contributions from 517 atoms with multiple isomorphous replacement phases, but the side-chains of residues 3 to 9 were not included in the F c. Contours represent densities within 2-5 A of protein atoms. The shapes at positions 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 clearly correspond to Ile, Leu, Phe, Tyr and Thr at these locations. Residues 4 and 8 are glycine.

interpret. We have constructed several different models for the chain reversal 57 to 60 (see section (c), below), for the segment from 90 to 99, for the portion of the major insertion between positions 126 and 138, and for the entry to the C-terminal helix. All of these regions are exposed to solvent and none of the sequences is known. Between residues 26 to 30 and 66 to 71, the density is much weaker than in neighboring segments, regardless of the way in which phases are computed. Without a sequence that spans the latter section, we cannot be certain of the number of residues between 66 and the position now designated as 72. Finally, it is possible that the C terminus of the molecule is not well-ordered in our crystals. The side-chain density at 167 corresponds reasonably to Leu, as expected from the sequence (Fig. 2), but the three preceding side-chains are not clear enough to confirm the location of the tetrapeptide Glu-Gly-Phe-Leu. Because of these several ambiguities, the chain length of our model may be in error by a few residues. (b) Comparison with the folding of flavodoxin from Clostridium MP Despite our reservations about some features of the model for A. nidulans flavodoxin, the clarity of the electron density maps is sufficient to permit an initial comparison with flavodoxin from Clostridium MP. Models of the two flavodoxins were aligned by matching atoms in the parallel sheet, according to the algorithm of Rao & Rossmann (1973). The peptide units of 39 sheet residues were initially designated as structural equivalents by visual inspection. As refinement of the rigid-body transformation proceeded, putative equivalents whose positions

differed by more than 1"2 A were discarded. The final transformation matched 119 atoms with a root-mean-square discrepancy of 0"63 A. The superimposed molecules are compared in Figure 4. Residues 120 to 139 account for the major part of the difference in chain lengths. The five residues added between position 89 of A. nidulans flavodoxin (88 in clostridial flavodoxin) and position 101 (95 in clostridial flavodoxin) produce a large difference in the conformation of this segment, which forms part of the FMN-binding site (see below). Another insertion of two residues occurs before the start of the C-terminal helix, and the N terminus is extended by two residues in A. nidulans flavodoxin. In surface connections such as residues 35 through 47, the divergences in sequence (Fig. 2) are associated with local variability in conformation (Fig. 4(c)). Of the four helices, the closest structural equivalence is observed for the start of helix 1, whose N terminus constitutes part of the binding site for the phosphate of FMN. The comparable helix is also well-conserved among the larger family of nucleotide-binding proteins (Rossmann et al., 1975). A lateral displacement of helices 3 and 4 is readily apparent in Figure 4(a) and (c). Preliminary comparison with D. vulgaris flavodoxin, which lacks the equivalent of residues 120 to 139 (Ludwig & Partridge, 1980; Ludwig et al., 1982), suggests that these shifts are not directly correlated with the presence of the insert at residues 120 to 139. When the parallel sheets of D. vulgaris and A. nidulans flavodoxins are aligned, the helices beginning near residue 100 (~3) superimpose much better than the comparable regions in Figure 4(c), as do the final two turns of the C-terminal helices (a4). On the other hand, the location of residues 147 to 159 in A. nidulans flavodoxin may be infuenced by packing interactions with the chain at 119 to 126. The helixhelix and sheet-helix packing (Chothia et al., 1977; Janin & Chothia, 1980; Richmond & Richards, 1978) in A. nidulans flavodoxin deserve fuller examination when the composition of the interacting segments has been determined. Sequences of the C-terminal regions of flavodoxins are known to be highly variable, whereas the alignment of the N-terminal residues can be achieved with comparative ease (Fox, 1976), and we anticipated that most of the additions to the chain would occur in the latter part of the sequence. Insertion of a block of residues is reminiscent of the situation in the cytochrome c family, where major changes in chain length involve insertion or deletion of a contiguous sequence of residues (Dickerson & Timkovich, 1975; Diekerson, 1980). The analogy with the cytochromes predicts that other long chain flavodoxins, e.g. the proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii or Rhodospirillum rubrum, may also contain an "extra lobe" adjoining sheet strand 5. None of the residues in this region makes direct contact with FMN atoms, although the inserted sequence could conceivably affect the pattern of interaction of A. nidulans flavodoxin with the proteins for which it is a substrate (Mayhew & Ludwig, 1975). Insertion of residues 120 to 139 is accomplished with minimal distortion of the parallel sheet from the conformation found in flavodoxins with shorter chains. Superposition of the Clostridium M P and A. nidulans molecules (Fig. 4(b)) reveals that the added residues join the chain at a point where the sheet hydrogenbonding is interrupted by a solvent bridge in flavodoxins from Clostridium M P (Burnett et al., 1974) and D. vulgaris (Watenpaugh et al., 1973).

M P flavodoxin, residues 112 to 114 do not hydrogen bond to strand 4 of the parallel sheet; the chain returns from its two-residue "bubble" with a hydrogen bond involving l15N. Residues ll7 to 119 in A. nidulans flavodoxin are approximate equivalents of l l l to 113 in clostridial flavodoxin (Fig. 4(b)), but instead of rejoining the sheet, residue 120 turns away, initiating the inserted lobe. Many of the hydrogen bonds between strands 4 and 5 seem to be conserved despite the insertion. In the vicinity of residues 83 to 88, 115 to 117 and 140 to 143, the electron density map of A. nidulans flavodoxin can be satisfactorily fitted by peptide orientations that result in the same hydrogen-bonding scheme found in flavodoxin from Clostridium M P . I t is interesting that the chain of lactate dehydrogenase departs from the nucleotide-binding domain at a position corresponding to residue 114 of clostridial or 140 of A . nidulans flavodoxin (Rao & Rossmann, 1973). However, the flavinbinding domains of the larger flavoproteins, glutathione reductase (Schulz et al., 1978; Schulz, 1980; Thieme et al., 1981), and p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Wierenga et al., 1979,1982) are constructed with five strand parallel sheets, which do not include the analog of the fifth strand found in flavodoxins.

(c) The F M N binding site Residues in the sequences 9 to 14, 55 to 61 and 88 to 99 comprise the FMN : protein interface and form hydrogen bonds to the prosthetic group. The binding site is displayed in Figure 5. We paid particular attention to the construction of the active center, and considered alternative orientations of the peptide units in several cases. The fit of the partly refined model to the electron density can be viewed in Figure 6. In Figure 7, the FMN-binding sites of Clostridium M P and A. nidulans fiavodoxins are superimposed, using the alignment determined for the parallel sheet. Oxygens of the FMN phosphate are within hydrogen-bonding distance of sidechain hydroxyls and backbone amides in the sequence 9 to 14 (Fig. 5). O-I may also hydrogen bond to the ring NH of Trp57, but assignment of this and other hydrogen bonds must be confirmed by further refinement. Conservation of the sequence of the phosphate-binding subsite (9 to 14 in A. nidulans flavodoxin) has suggested t h a t the homologous sequences should superimpose in three dimensions (Mayhew & Ludwig, 1975; Fox, 1976). The atoms of residues 11 to 14, not included in the determination of the transformation relating clostridial and A . nidulans flavodoxins, do superimpose on their equivalents in Clostridium M P flavodoxin, with a root-mean-square discrepancy of 1"09 A. However, it appears likely that replacement of Ser54, a hydrogen-bond donor to O-I in clostridial flavodoxin, by Pro55 in A. nidulans flavodoxin and substitution of Trp57 for Met56 are accompanied by subtle changes in the protein-phosphate interactions. Construction in the Richards' box of the chain including residues 88 to 99 began with residue 86, which is clearly Phe or Tyr. At position 90, a choice had to be made between main and side-chain density. The orientation shown in Figures 5 and 6 avoids placing the main-chain in weak density, and requires that 90 be Val or a similar branched residue. One consequence of this choice is that the amide group of residue 90 is positioned to interact with atoms N-1 and 0-2~ of the FMN.

Fro. 5. The FMN binding site of A. nidulans flavodoxin. Filled bonds differentiate the prosthetic group fl'om tile protein, where residue numbem adjoin C~ atoms. The ribityl side-chain atoms are designated with an R, e.g. CRI. Protein co-ordinates were obtained by model-building (Table 3, line 10). The isoalloxazine ring is assumed to be planar, with the bond distances for an "ideal" oxidized flavin (Wang & Fritchie, 1973): the ribityl phosphate co-ordinates were adjusted by energy minimization (Levitt, 1974). Protein backbone-isoalloxazine hydrogen bonds are possible at 0(2~)-90N (2-8 A, N-1-90N (2'9A), O-2a-99N (3"5A), N-3-970 (3-2 A), and O-4~-60N (3-3 A). Where the sequence is unknown, side-chains have been omitted or truncated to the Ca, except for Trp57 and Trp94. The alternative, with C090 pointing toward these same flavin atoms, would entail repulsive interactions with O-2a and with the anionic form of reduced FMN, which has a formal charge at N-1-..O-2~.

For the map in (a), residues 89 to 99 were subtracted from F: and in (b), residues 57 to 61 were subtracted from F c. The densities shown in (a) and (b} confirm the assigned course of the polypeptide chain, but comparison of the models with the deletion map densities indicates the need for further adjustment of some of the individual atoms. Atoms of FMN are identified in Fig. 5. Each view was selected to display a particular subregion of the active site ; the orientations differ in each panel and correspond only approximately to the view in Figs 5 and 7. (a) A view of the interactions between the flavin ring and the residues in the sequence 88 to 99. The side-chain density at 94 corresponds best to a Trp residue with the indole ring nearly parallel to the isoailoxazine ring. Residue 90 has been built as Val. (b) The chain reversal at residues 57 to 61 with the isoalloxazine ring. The orientation of the peptide units in this region is discussed in the text. Contours corresponding to the indole ring of Trp57 are not shown. Density extending from the C~ of residue 58 suggests that it is not glyeine. The side-chains at 61 and 62 correspond well to Glu and Leu.

Fie,. 7. Comparison of the FMN-binding sites in flavodoxins from A. nidulans (filled bonds) and Clostridium M P (open bonds). The structures were aligned by matching atoms in the parallel sheet. A few backbone nitrogens of clostridial flavodoxin and C~ atoms of A. nidulans flavodoxin have been labeled for reference ; the phosphate-binding loops are not shown (cf. Fig. 5), nor are the "outer" Trp" residues (90 in Clostridium M P and 94 in A. nidulans). Positions of the C~ and Ca atoms of these Trp residues are not homologous in the 2 flavodoxins. In Clostridium M P flavodoxin, the outer Trp is inclined to the isoalloxazine ring at an angle of about 20 °.

residue 99 is oriented to hydrogen bond to O-2a. These backbone-flavin interactions are similar to those found in D. vulgaris flavodoxin (Watenpaugh et al., 1972,1973), but bear little resemblance to the active center of Clostridium M P flavodoxin, where the side-chain of Glu59 forms a hydrogen bond to N-3. From Figures 4(b) and 7, it is evident that the chain from residue 89 to 100 (A. nidulans numbering) follows a very different course in A. nidulans and Clostridium M P flavodoxins; the discrepancies cannot be described as a simple looping out of five inserted residues. A larger planar density at position 94 suggests Trp at this location (Fig. 6(a)). This outer, or solvent-exposed, Trp is almost parallel to the flavin ring. Residue 57 is also identified from the density as Trp, but the indole ring at 57 is not stacked with the isoalloxazine ring. Enclosure of the flavin ring by two tryptophans, along with the protein contacts provided by residues 58 to 59 and 90 to 94, reduces the solvent accessibility of the flavin ring, and may account for the pronounced vibrational resolution of the 450 nm absorbance that is a notable feature of the spectrum of A. nidulans flavodoxin (Smillie & Entsch, 1971). The orientation of the isoalloxazine ring is quite different in flavodoxins from A. nidulans and Clostridium M P (Fig. 1). The principal interactions that determine the position of the flavin ring in A. nidulans flavodoxin appear to be the backbone-flavin hydrogen bonds at N-l, N-3 and O-2a of the flavin ring, the stacking with Trp94 and the Trp57 contacts. Only the N-1 interaction is duplicated in clostridial flavodoxin. The torsion angles along the ribityl phosphate backbone all have the same "sense" in the two flavodoxins, but small torsional adjustments, especially about N-10-C-I', adapt the prosthetic group to the different environments encountered in each protein.

Residues in the reverse bend near position 59 have been implicated in stabilization of the semiquinone state, in both Clostridium M P (Smith et al., 1977 ; Ludwig et al., 1976) and D. vulgaris (Watenpaugh et al., 1976) flavodoxins. We might expect, from the reported redox potential (Entsch & Smillie, 1972) for the oxidized/semiquinone equilibrium, t h a t this region of A. nidulans flavodoxin would display some unusual features. The residue following Trp57 seems not to be Gly, which occupies the homologous position in the other known structures. Models for the chain beyond residue 57 have been built with various conformations (Smith et al., 1978; Ludwig et al., 1982). In the current interpretation, the backbone of residues 57 to 60 approximates a t y p e I I 31o bend, b u t with NH60 closer to the flavin O 4 a than to 0-57. Figure 6(b) provides a stereo view of the partly refined model in the electron density. Determination of the sequence beyond residue 57 should help to resolve the difficulties in assigning the conformation of residues 58 to 61.
