Three novel, N-acyl-pro-pyrrolidine-type, inhibitors of prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) with nanomolar activities were synthesized and their binding analyzed to the host enzyme in the light of X-ray diffraction and molecular modeling studies. We were interested in the alteration in the binding affinity at the S3 site as a function of the properties of the N-terminal group of the inhibitors. Our studies revealed that, for inhibitors with flat aromatic terminal groups, the optimal length of the linker chain is three C-C bonds, but this increases to four C-C bonds if there is a bulky group in the terminal position. Molecular dynamics calculations indicate that this is due to the better fit into the binding pocket. A 4-fold enhancement of the inhibitor activity upon replacement of the 4-CH2 group of the proline ring by CF2 is a consequence of a weak hydrogen bond formed between the fluorine atom and the hydroxy group of Tyr473 of the host enzyme. There is notably good agreement between the calculated and experimental free energies of binding; the average error in the IC50 values is around 1 order of magnitude.
Introduction Prolyl oligopeptidase (POPa) (EC 3.4.21.26), previously called prolyl endopeptidase or postproline cleaving enzyme, a cytosolic serine protease, degrades a variety of proline-containing peptides by cleaving the peptide bond on the carboxy side of proline residues.1 Its active site consists of a catalytic Ser554His680Asp641 triad that is common in all serine proteases. The enzyme is selective for oligopeptides not longer than about 30 amino acid residues.2 It has been identified and purified from various mammalian tissues, such as the brain, liver, muscle and kidney.3-10 POP degrades proline-containing neuropeptides involved in the processes of memory and learning, such as vasopressin, substance P and thyrotropin-releasing hormone.11 Its activity in plasma correlates with different stages of depression,12 and it has also been suggested that the enzyme participates in the control of blood pressure through the degradation of bradykinin, and angiotensin I and II.13 POP also plays a central role in mood stabilization, learning and memory modulating inositol concentration.14,15a Inhibitors of POP are potential therapeutic agents15 in the treatment for dysfunction of the memory system, for example, Alzheimer's disease,16 and for the improvement of general cognitive behavior in the elderly.17 The C-terminal catalytic domain of POP belongs in the R/ hydrolase fold family.18,19 Sequence homology can be detected with lipases,20 while it is structurally unrelated to the chymotrypsin and subtilisin serine protease families. X-ray protein crystallographic investigations suggested that its N-terminal

seven-bladed propeller domain regulates access to the active site, which is in a large cavity at the interface of the two domains,21,22 but recent investigations revealed that an openingclosing mechanism of domains is more likely.23 The crystal structure of the complex with a reversible transition state inhibitor, 124 (Z-Pro-prolinal), reveals that the prolinal residue is covalently bonded to the active site serine, with the proline and the phenyl moiety of benzyloxycarbonyl groups accommodated in subsites S2 and S3, respectively.21 Subsite S3 is more open than subsite S1, which allows the binding of larger residues. The wide subsite S3 is very hydrophobic in nature. The structures of POP (both native and inactive mutant forms) complexes with substrates and substrate analogues have shed light on various structural aspects of the catalytic mechanism, and substrate binding.25-28 Most currently available inhibitors are derivatives of the transition-state analogue inhibitor, for example, 1 and the reversible 217 (SUAM-1221) (Figure 1). The effects of modification of the five-membered rings, the shape and polarity of the N-terminal moiety and the linker connecting the N-terminal group and the proline ring on the inhibitor potency have been extensively studied in Vitro.29 In our POP program, substitution of the 4-phenylbutanoyl of 2 with hexanoyl resulted in 3a with activity similar to that of 2.30-32 Substitution of the 4-CH2 group of the proline moiety of 3a with a sulfur atom resulted in a derivative 3b that was 4 times more active. Introduction of carbonyl-containing Nheterocycles into the end of the alkyl chain of compounds 3 led to novel types of POP inhibitors 4 with nanomolar activities.33,34 A comparative molecular field analysis study on 44 derivatives of 4 containing phthalimido (e.g., 5) or saccharino moieties as N-terminal group suggested some steric and electronic modifications on these N-heterocyclic end-groups35 (Figure 2). However, as the interactions at subsite S3 of POP are nonspecific and difficult to predict, we decided to map these interactions in the structures of the complexes for derivatives 6, 8, and 11. We determined the structures of three POP inhibitor

Compounds 14 were prepared by alkylation of quinoxalin-2one 1339 with ethyl -bromoalkanoates in DMF in the presence of NaH, followed by acidic hydrolysis. Replacement of methylene by a CF2 moiety may enhance the biological activity,40 and we therefore decided to synthesize and investigate 6. The starting difluoro derivative 16b was prepared from (2S,4R)-1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-hydroxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid 1741 as outlined in Scheme 2. Compound 17 was coupled with pyrrolidine by the classical mixed anhydride method to give 18. Subsequent Swern oxidation of the secondary hydroxy group of 17 provided the corresponding oxo derivative 18, which could be transformed to the difluoro derivative via a known protocol with DAST.42 A deprotective step with HCl/EtOAc gave access to 16b. Compounds 5-11 exhibit cis-trans isomerism about the prolyl amide bond in solution.43 Results and Discussion From the aspect of inhibitor design, it is important to know the main driving forces that influence the position of the N-terminal group at subsite S3 of the enzyme. A further question is why the optimal linker chain length is three C-C bonds for some N-terminal groups and four C-C bonds for others. The 4-fold enhancement of the inhibitor activity upon substitution of the 4-CH2 of the P2 proline ring by CF2, a group of similar size, was a further interesting result. It was decided to attempt to clarify the structural basis of this finding. We carried out X-ray crystallographic studies of enzyme-inhibitor complexes, as representatives of the inhibitor families (6, 8 and 11), in order to try to answer these questions. The Binding Pattern at Subsites S1 and S2 is WellDefined. The accommodation of molecules 6, 8 and 11 in their complex structures with POP is very similar to that of 1. There are only minor differences in the interacting side chain conformations of POP, in spite of the shape diversity of the N-terminal residue and the P2 proline ring of these inhibitors. Figure 3 depicts the superposition of inhibitors at the active site, while Table 1 lists contacting residues. The complex structures preserve the hydrogen bonds tying the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the linker between P3 and P2 groups, and the proline moiety (P2) to the Trp595 and Arg643 side chains, respectively. In the substrate specificity pocket (S1), the C-terminal pyrrolidine moieties of the studied inhibitors form several contacts with various side chains and also with the active site serine, Ser554 (Table 1, Figure 3). However, as they are unable to bind covalently to the active site serine, the five-membered ring of the C-terminal pyrrolidine can be slightly rotated about the N-C bond, while it retains its stacking interaction with the indole ring of Trp595. Subsite S2, lined by Cys255, Tyr473, Phe476, Trp595 and Arg643, has a slightly polar character and is partially open toward the cavity of the enzyme. The hydrophobic side chain of Pro forms relatively few contacts with it. We found that replacement of the 4-CH2 moiety by 4-CF2 results in a 4 times lower IC50 value (Table 2, 5 vs 6). Comparison of the crystal structures of the complex formed between POP and molecule 6 and the other complexes reveals a weak hydrogen bond between the fluorine atom (cis to the proline carboxyl) of 6 and the hydroxy group of Tyr473 (3.5 ล, Figure 3). We suggest that this extra hydrogen bond is responsible for the stronger inhibitory effect of 6. The other fluorine atom is solvent-exposed.

There Are Three Types of Inhibitor Binding at Subsite S3. At the border of the two domains of POP, the substrate binding groove broadens, generating the flat and open subsite S3, lined by residues Phe173, Met235, Gly236, Ala594 and backbone atoms of Ser174 below and by Gly254, Cys255 and side chain carbon atoms of Arg252 on one side. At the border of subsites S2 and S3, besides the hydrogen bond with Trp595, plane-to-plane contacts with the guanidino group of Arg643 stabilize the P2-P3 amide bond for all inhibitors examined. The linker between the P2 amide nitrogen and the ring system of the N-terminal group is three C-C bonds long for inhibitors 6 and 8, similarly as for 1. These molecules with three linker C-C bonds stack on the flat bottom of subsite S3, forming

several contacts with Phe173 (see Figure 4A and Table 1). The planes of their rings are in very similar orientations: the plane angle with the P3 group's plane of 6 is -4.9ฐ for 8, and -2.2ฐ for 1. However, the positions of these ring systems in the complexes differ significantly from that of the benzyl group in 1 (Figure 4A). While the phenyl group in 1 is close to the wall of subsite S3, it is mainly stabilized by Ala594 and Cys255 besides Met235 and Ile591, forming few contacts with Phe173. The ring systems of the imido and amido group-containing inhibitors 6 and 8, respectively, with more polar characters, are shifted closer to Phe173. The vicinity of the NCO group to Arg643 and the similarity of the conformations of the linker chains of 6 and 8, and of the position of the ring N atoms, suggest that the N-terminal groups of these molecules participate in a similar hydrogen-bonding network, though waters mediating these hydrogen bonds could not be localized in electron density maps. Possibly for better binding of the phenyl group in 8, the imido group in that inhibitor is shifted as compared with those in 6, but the guanidino group in Arg643 is also shifted.

Inhibitors with three C-C bond linkers in their P3 moiety (A) bind in significantly different orientations from those with four C-C linkers (B). The ribbon model of the protein is colored gray, while 1 covalently bound to Ser554 of Protein Data Bank entry 1QFS is shown in dark-gray as reference.

oxygen of 6 are 4.4 and 3.7 ล, while the amido one of 8 are 4.3 and 4.8 ล, respectively. The plane angles of guanidine and oxo groups are 70.7ฐ and 49.0ฐ for 6 and 8, respectively, with oxy group-guanidine plane distances of 3.5 ล in both complexes.) This relates to the hydrogen-bonded connection with Arg643. Although the ring systems in 6 and 8 have very different sizes and shapes, their imido moieties are still bonded in a similar way. This suggests that the building-up of the hydrogen-bonding network, including the imido oxygen in the inhibitor and the guanidino group in Arg643, is a very important factor for stabilization of the complex. The N-heterocyclic (aromatic) moieties in 6 and 8 cover different regions of subsite S3. While that in 6 binds between the side chains of Met235 and Phe173, those in 8 are accommodated mainly by the side chain of Met235 and are close to the edge of the "wall" at the side of subsite S3 and contact Cys255. The phenyl group in 8 undergoes a stacking interaction with the amide plane of the Phe173-Ser174 peptide bond. The other side of the phenyl group is solvent-exposed due to the broadening of subsite S3. As the nearby groups of the protein

are polar, replacement of the phenyl group by a polar aromatic group would facilitate further favorable interactions with the binding site. The complexes with inhibitors 6 and 8 reveal the reason for the different optimal linker chain length in molecules 10 and 11. These also possess the imido oxygen at the junction of their N-terminal moiety and the linker chain, but they cannot adopt the same position as can 6 and 8 in their complexes, because this requires a flat N-terminal group stacked tightly to the bottom of subsite S3. The N-terminal group in 10 and 11 is sterically demanding. Its large substituents (i.e., phenyl groups) lie out of the plane of the central imido ring of the N-terminal group. Indeed, the crystal structure of the POP-11 complex shows the N-terminal group in a different position, with contacts different from those of the other complex structures (cf. Table 1). Its connecting chain with the extra CH2 group bends toward the "wall" of subsite S3 (cf. Figure 4B and Table 1). The hydrogen bond of the imido oxygen is lost and the hydantoin moiety contacts the side chains of Met235 from one side and Cys255 from the other. Its plane is rotated by 41.9ฐ, allowing the formation of a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of

contrast with molecules with other P3 groups, where those with the shorter chain (n ) 1) exhibit higher binding affinities. Structures 10 and 11 have the largest P3 group, and thus, they are unable to simultaneously adopt a low energy conformation and undergo favorable interactions with the enzyme when the alkyl chain is short (n ) 1, 10). The insertion of an extra methylene group (n ) 2, 11) allows the P3 group to fit better into the binding pocket. Although the conformational strain is still significant, the lack of the highly unfavorable electrostatic interactions demonstrated by the MD simulation in 10 (cf. Table 2) means that 11 binds to the enzyme with increased affinity as compared with 10. Conclusions Our X-ray diffraction study has shed light on various aspects of the binding of N-acyl-pro-pyrrolidine-type inhibitors of POP. Analysis of the structures of the complexes provides an efficient tool in drug design. The enhanced inhibitory activity of the -CF2-substituted proline-containing derivatives proved to be due to the formation of a new hydrogen bond and a subsequent slight shift of the N-acyl-pro-pyrrolidine moiety. The crystal structures available allowed us to study the change in binding power at the S3 site, depending on the size, shape and polarity of the N-terminal group of the inhibitors. Inhibitors with flat ring systems are stacked on the bottom of the S3 site. For these inhibitors, the optimal linker chain length is three C-C bonds. Insertion of an imido moiety into the junction of the ring system allows hydrogen bond formation with water molecules of the first solvent shell of the enzyme, indicated by a shift of the ring position in the complex as compared with the hydrophobic benzyloxycarbonyl group. We have provided an explanation for the change in optimal length of the linker chain for a derivative with a bulky N-terminal group. The binding site of this group overlaps only partially with those of the flat ones. Experimental Section
Chemistry. Compounds 12,37 1538 and 16a36 were prepared according to literature methods. All other reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich or Fluka and were used as received. Solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure on a Buchi RE111 จ rotavapor. Flash chromatography was performed on Merck Kieselgel gel 60 (230-400 mesh) silica, with CH2Cl2/MeOH as mobile phase. Melting points were determined on a Buchi-530 melting point จ apparatus and were uncorrected. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avanence DRX200 instrument [200 MHz,  ) 0 (TMS), in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 as solvent]. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm, and signal multiplicities are described as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet) or br (broad).

Gly254. A dipole-dipole interaction is also established between the carbonyl groups of the N-terminal group and Gly254 in reverse orientation. One of the phenyl rings lies in the extension of subsite S3, packed between the side chain of Met235 and side chain carbon atoms of Arg252, while the other is accommodated above subsite S3 by Arg252 side chain carbon atoms and Cys255. Molecular Dynamics (MD). Calculations were performed to study the structural and energetic features of some representative complexes. The calculated free energies of binding, together with the experimental values, are presented in Table 2 and Figure 5. The mean unsigned error is 1.37 kcal/mol, which corresponds to an error of approximately 1 order of magnitude in IC50. This agreement between the calculated and experimental values is remarkably good with regard to the simple model applied (see Computations within the Experimental Section). The pyrrolidine head of the ligands resides at the hydrophobic S1 binding site, while other regions are partially exposed to water in the central cavity. In the course of the MD simulations of the enzyme-ligand complexes, the pro-pyrrolidine moiety exhibited little flexibility and adopted similar conformations in all complexes. Moreover, the bound conformations of these fragments are very close to that obtained in water. For all the studied molecules, a favorable van der Waals and an unfavorable electrostatic energy component (cf. Table 2) were found to accompany the change of the environment from water to enzyme. The conformational strain proved to be significant in the binding of molecules 8, 10 and 11. These are the structures with the largest N-terminal groups. In spite of the open nature of the S3 binding site, the bulky substituents are unable to adopt a low-energy conformation. The excess conformational energy is close to the higher limit of the conformational strain that typically occurs in ligand binding.44 It is interesting that in the higher homologue of 8, that is, 9, the conformational strain almost disappears (cf. Table 2). This can occur because the increased length of the alkyl chain gives more flexibility to the molecule and allows the P3 group to penetrate further into the large water-filled pocket of the -propeller region. In spite of the decreased conformational strain, 9 binds to POP with lower affinity than does 8, since the latter interacts more favorably with the enzyme. A comparison of molecules 10 and 11 reveals better binding of the latter, which has a longer alkyl chain (n ) 2). This is in

After removal of the cerebellum, the whole brains of male rats (Sprague-Dawley, 180-220 g) were homogenized in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA buffer, pH ) 7.5. The homogenate was centrifuged and the 40 000g supernatant was used at 300 times final dilution in the reaction mixture. Enzyme reactions were performed at room temperature for 15 min in the presence of 62.5 nM Z-glycyl-prolyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin as a highly specific synthetic substrate of POP. The inhibitory effects of the compounds were tested at inhibitor concentrations of 100-0.001 nM. The formation of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was detected by spectrofluorometry at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. The concentrations of the compounds producing 50% inhibition (IC50) were calculated by curve fitting of the % inhibition versus inhibitor concentration (M) plot, using the Hill equation. X-ray Crystallography. POP purified from porcine muscle was purchased from Laszlo Polgar in the Institute of Enzymology, ด ด ด Hungarian Academy of Sciences.45,46 Crystals were grown by cocrystallization at 4 ฐC, using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir composition was as described by Fulop et จ จ al.21 Drops were prepared by mixing equal amounts of protein solution (10 mg/mL) and the reservoir solution containing the inhibitor (1 mM). The largest crystals were obtained by microseeding. Data were collected at room temperature, using a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC image plate detector attached to a Rigaku RU-H2R

rotating anode generator from one crystal for each complex. The resolutions of data sets were 3.0, 2.8 and 2.5 ล for the complexes with 6, 8 and 11, respectively. Data processing was carried out with the programs MOSFLM47 (complexes with inhibitors 8 and 11), BioteX48 (POP-6 complex) and SCALA.49 The scaled diffraction intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes by using the program Truncate.50 The structures were isostructural with those of POP complexes and mutants to be found in the Protein Data Bank. Rigid body fitting was carried out with the program AMoRe51 of the Collaborative Computing Project 4 suite,52 with the protein part of Protein Data Bank53 entry 1QFS. The model building steps were carried out with program O54 and the resulting model was refined with X-PLOR, version 3.851.55 During the refinement, we used torsion angle dynamics (slow cooling from 4000 K), resolution-dependent weighting, overall anisotropic Bfactor refinement, bulk solvent correction and grouped B-factor refinement. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 3EQ7, 3EQ8 and 3EQ9 for 6, 8 and 11, respectively. Table 3 shows data collection and refinement statistics. Computations. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the binding of the ligands in Table 2 and to make estimates of the free energies of binding. A modified version of the Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) method of ลqvist et al.56 was applied. The free energy change accompanying ligand binding was calculated as

or enzyme atom were deleted. Evaporation of water was prevented by half-harmonic constraints. Residues within 18 ล from the center of the sphere were allowed to move, while residues in an outer 2 ล shell were fixed. The rest of the system was not included in the simulations. The AMBER force field of Cornell et al.58 was applied. Charges were calculated by the multiple fitting procedure59,60 from an ab initio 6-31G* wave function obtained with the Gaussian 98 program.61 A nonbonded cutoff of 15 ล was used and the SHAKE algorithm62,63 was applied for bonds involving hydrogen atoms. NVT simulations with coupling to an external heat bath64 were performed. The ligand-enzyme systems were first gradually heated from 10 to 298 K. We applied positional constraints on the heavy atoms at low temperature and the constraints were gradually released in the course of heating. Simulations were then performed for 100 ps with a time step of 1 fs at a temperature of 298 K, using the SYBYL suite of programs.65 Data collection was performed in the final 70 ps. The experimental G values were obtained as G ) RT ln Ki, where Ki, the dissociation constant of a complex, was calculated66 as Ki ) IC50/(1 + S/Km), where S is the substrate concentration and Km is the Michaelis constant of the substrate.

G ) 1/2{Eele(L - E) - Eele(L - W)} + {Evdw(L - E) Evdw(L - W)} + {Esolute(LE) - Esolute(LW)} (1)
where Eele(L - E) is the electrostatic interaction energy between the ligand and the enzyme, and Eele(L - W) is that between the ligand and water. The van der Waals components are designated analogously. Esolute(LE) is the internal energy of the ligand bound to the enzyme, and Esolute(LW) is the internal energy of the free ligand in water. This equation differs from that of ลqvist et al. by the presence of the last term, which can be identified as the ligand strain accompanying complex formation. In the equation, the factor 1/2 for the electrostatic term corresponds to the `ideal' value of the LIE method, and it was found that the experimental values could be reasonably reproduced without multiplying the van der Waals term by a factor different from 1. The setup of the MD simulations was as follows. The ligand and the enzyme/ligand systems were immersed in a previously equilibrated TIP3P57 water droplet with 20 ล radius. Water molecules within 2.5 ล heavy atom separations from any ligand
