Introduction: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy) belongs to a nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that includes receptors for vitamin D, retinoic acid, oestrogen and androgen receptors. PPARy functions as a transcription factor after it forms a complex with its co-activators PGC-1 or PGC-2, that in turn regulates gene expression. Ligands for PPARy such as ciglitizone and troglitazone have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This study tested the effect of ciglitizone and/or testosterone on cell growth, and cell cycle regulators in prostate cancer cells. Materials and Methods:

Invasive prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 and PC-3 were used in this study. RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR were used to assess the degree of PPARy, PGC-1 , AR, cyclin Dl, ~27~`~' and ~57~`~~ expression at the mRNA level. Cell growth was measured using RibogreenTM Technology. The possible contribution of PPARy to biological effects was evaluated by using PPARy antisense oligo. Results: Using a cell growth assay, PPARy agonist ciglitizone inhibited the growth of DU-145 cells. A combination of testosterone and ciglitizone significantly (P = 0.003) enhanced the effect of ciglitizone. The action of testosterone and ciglitizone on cell growth was reversed after the expression of PPARy was eliminated by antisense oligo to PPARy. High levels of PPARy and its coactivator receptor PGC-1 were detected in DU-145 cells. DU-145 and PC-3 cells expressed transcripts for the androgen receptor. Cyclin Dl levels were down regulated in DU-145 and PC-3 cells after incubation with ciglitizone (20pM), testosterone (IOOpM) or a combination of the both. Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors ~27~`~' and ~57~`~~were both up regulated in prostate cancer cells by these compounds. Conclusion: Androgen receptor agonists and PPARy agonists have synergistic effects on the growth of prostate cancer cells. This effect is at least partly mediated via the action of agonists on cell cycle regulators, including cyclin Dl , ~27~`~' and P57Kip2.
