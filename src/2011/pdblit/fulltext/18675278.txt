Abstract aIF2L is an archaeal homolog of eukaryotic translaL tion factor eIF2L necessary for translation initiation and involved L in recognition of the initiation codon. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time zinc binding to the C2 ^C2 zinc finger at the C-terminus of aIF2L. Nuclear magnetic resonance L backbone assignments were also determined and the secondary structural elements identified. ß 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction The zinc ¢nger is an important structural motif ¢rst described in the Xenopus laevis transcription factor TFIIIA [1] and other nucleic acid binding proteins such as ADR1 [2], X¢n [3] and SW15 [4]. It is estimated that about 1% of all mammalian genes encode zinc ¢ngers [5]. The zinc ¢nger is a simple structure consisting of a short polypeptide loop folded back on itself with the aid of a metal ion [6]. Zn2þ is tetrahedrally coordinated by di¡erent combinations of histidine and cysteine. Archaeal translation initiation factor aIF2 is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of K, L and Q subunits. By analogy to their highly similar ( v 48%) eukaryotic counterparts, the function of aIF2 is believed to be the formation of a ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated initiator methionyltRNA (Met-tRNAMet ) which then binds to the small ribosoi mal subunit [7]. With the aid of other factors, this complex scans from the 5P end of mRNA to the ¢rst initiation codon, GTP is then hydrolyzed and the aIF2-GDP complex is released. In order to start a new cycle of translation initiation, GDP bound to aIF2 must be exchanged for GTP in a reaction catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor aIF2B [8,9]. Phosphorylation of aIF2K regulates the exchange rate of GDP to GTP [10]. The Q subunit contains GTP binding motifs as well as sequences that have been involved in tRNA binding [11]. In archaea, the L subunit is the most divergent of

the three because it comprises only the C-terminal half of eIF2L which contains a zinc ¢nger domain involved in RNA binding [12]. The structure of eIF2K has been recently reported [13] The conserved residues in or near the C2 ^C2 ¢nger motif of aIF2L have been subjected to extensive mutational analysis in yeast eIF2L showing that the cysteine residues in this motif are essential for eIF2L function [14]. Elimination of only one of them, alteration of their spacing or the elimination of the complete motif results in inactivation of the protein. Some of the mutations found in yeast eIF2L are the sites of missense mutations that lead to translation initiation at non-AUG codons [14,15]. Some of the mutants also display an intrinsic GTPase activity [16]. Surprisingly, neither binding of zinc nor a functional requirement for zinc has been demonstrated for aIF2L or eIF2L [8,9,17,18] In the present study, we demonstrate for the ¢rst time that zinc is an important factor for the stability of the C2 ^C2 motif at the C-terminus of archaeal IF2L form. This suggests that zinc may play a role in the initiation of translation in both eukaryotes and archaebacteria. In addition, complete nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts as well as the identi¢cation of the secondary structural elements for aIF2L are reported. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Protein expression and puri¢cation Initiation factor aIF2L from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (gene MTH1769) was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 as an oligohistidine (His tag) fusion protein of 161 residues. Cells were grown at 37C to an OD600 of 0.8 and induced with 1 mM IPTG. Afterwards, the temperature was reduced to 30C and the cells were allowed to express the protein for 3 h before harvesting. The media used were either Luria broth (LB) or minimal salts (M9) media containing [15 N]ammonium chloride and/or [13 C]glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory, Andover, MA, USA) and 50 WM ZnCl2 . aIF2L was puri¢ed by heat denaturation of endogenous E. coli proteins and a/nity chromatography on Ni2þ -loaded chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The N-terminal His tag was cleaved from aIF2L by treatment for 24 h at room temperature with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1 U/mg fusion protein. Benzamidine Sepharose was used to remove thrombin. 2.2. Mass spectrometry ESI/MS analyses were performed utilizing a Perkin Elmer, API III spectrometer. aIF2L was puri¢ed as above and dialyzed extensively against 10% acetic acid. For protein grown in M9 medium, 1 Da per

3. Results and discussion The ¢rst evidence that zinc is important for the stability of aIF2L came from di¡erences in the size of aIF2L when produced in E. coli grown in LB and M9 media. SDS^PAGE of the His tag fusion protein from an LB culture showed the presence of a single band with the expected molecular size of 16.2 kDa (Fig. 1). In contrast, an additional band, smaller by V20 residues, was observed for protein puri¢ed from M9 cultures. This pointed to nutrient de¢ciency as a probable cause. Cleavage of the N-terminal histidine tag showed the same pattern as the uncleaved form, demonstrating that the degradation was at the C-terminus. As the predicted zinc ¢nger motif for aIF2L is also located at the C-terminus (Fig. 2), this suggested that zinc was possibly the missing nutrient. Supplementation with 50 WM ZnCl2 allowed us to obtain full-length aIF2L from minimal medium. Mass spectrometry revealed cleavage sites at L121 and L120 (Fig. 3). As proteolytic digestion of proteins in the absence of their metal ligand has been observed previously for other metalloproteins [22], we conclude that the absence of zinc causes the C-terminus of aIF2L to unfold, making it susceptible to cleavage by endogenous proteases. To test the metal binding properties of aIF2L, visible spectra of aIF2L in the presence and absence of Co2þ were recorded. Cobalt substitution for zinc has been commonly used to address the coordination environment of structural zinc sites in proteins [23]. Fig. 4 shows the visible spectrum of a cobalt^aIF2L adduct. The spectrum contains an absorbance maximum at 730 nm which is characteristic of tetrahedral coordination of Co2þ [24]. The importance of zinc for folding of the C-terminus was clearly seen in 15 N^1 H HSQC spectra of aIF2L with and without zinc (Fig. 5). Upon addition of ZnCl2 to the protein, several amide resonances shifted away from the overlapped amide resonances between 7.5 and 8.5 ppm in the proton dimension. These spectral changes indicate acquisition of additional folded structure in the presence of zinc. The dependence of zinc binding on the oxidation state of the cysteines was tested by recording 15 N^1 H HSQC spectra in the absence of DTT. No spectral changes were observed upon addition of zinc to oxidized aIF2L (data not shown). The assignments of

nitrogen was subtracted from the measured mass to account for the 15 N isotope enrichment. 2.3. Cobalt visible spectrophotometry Ultraviolet and visible light spectra of cobalt^aIF2L complexes were obtained on a Cary 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 20C. The spectrum was scanned at 600 nm/min from 800 to 200 nm with a 1 cm path length. Data points were collected each 2 nm. The sample was 0.6 mg/ml protein in 50 mM phosphate bu¡er, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at pH 6.0. CoCl2 was added from a 1 mM stock solution to ¢nal concentrations of 80, 160 and 240 WM. The protein was grown on LB medium and puri¢ed as described. Samples was dialyzed extensively against bu¡er containing 1 mM EDTA, to remove bound zinc, and dialyzed again against bu¡er to get rid of EDTA. 2.4. NMR spectroscopy All NMR spectra were recorded at 310 K on Bruker DRX500 and Varian UNITYplus 800 MHz spectrometers. Chemical shifts were measured to internal sodium 2,2-dimethyl-silapentane-5-sulfonate for 1 H and calculated for 13 C and 15 N, assuming Q15 N/Q1 H = 0.101329118 and Q13 C/Q15 H = 0.251449530 [19]. Spectra were processed using GIFA and XWINNMR software (Bruker Biospin) and analyzed with XEASY [20]. The assignments of 1 H, 15 N and 13 C resonances were based on the following experiments: CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNHA, 15 N-edited TOCSY, 15 N-edited NOESY and HCCHTOCSY. The secondary structure of aIF2L was analyzed using proton and carbon chemical shifts [21] and identi¢cation of characteristic NOEs. NMR samples were V1.0 mM protein in 50 mM Bis^Tris

Fig. 4. Visible absorption spectra of aIF2L with and without Co2þ . In the absence of CoCl2 aIF2L (45 WM) is colorless (continuous line). Addition of 80 WM CoCl2 led to an absorption peak at 730 nm, which is distinctive of tetrahedrally complexed cobalt (dashed line). Further additions of CoCl2 caused no additional changes in the absorption spectrum.

the backbone resonances of the zinc-bound aIF2L reveal that most of the zinc-shifted peaks are from the putative C-terminal C2 -C2 zinc binding motif. Knowledge of the HK , CK and CL chemical shifts was used to determine the secondary structure of aIF2L (Fig. 2). It is an K/L protein with ¢ve K-helices and six L-strands. It has been clearly demonstrated for other zinc ¢ngers that Zn2þ is tetrahedrally bound [25,26] and that, for C2 ^C2 motifs, the cysteines are responsible for the Zn2þ coordination [27]. Based on the secondary structure of aIF2L, the identi¢cation of medium-range NOEs and the location of the cysteine residues, it is possible to predict the structure of its zinc ¢nger. Fig. 2 shows that the zinc ¢nger motif consists of a loop containing C102 and C105 followed by a L-hairpin between strands 5 and 6, and a short helix containing C126. This result contrasts with the classical zinc ¢nger motif which is composed of a L-strand and an K-helix. Chemical shift information have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (http://www.bmrb. wisc.edu) under accession number 5202. Determination of the

three-dimensional solution structure of aIF2L is currently in progress in our laboratory and will be described in detail elsewhere. Zinc is essential for the structural stability of known zinc ¢ngers, so it was surprising that given the high conservation of the cysteines in aIF2L and eIF2L, the importance of this metal for IF2L structure or function has not been previously demonstrated. Several mutagenesis studies have shown the importance of residues at the C-terminus for the function of yeast eIF2L [15]. Especially interesting are the non-conservative substitutions R248T, R253I, R253S and L254P (corresponding to R114, R117 and I118 of the archaeal protein) as they are located at the tip of the zinc ¢nger and allow translation to initiate at UUG codons instead of AUG. This region is strongly conserved. We believe that these residues play an important role in the speci¢c recognition of the MettRNAMet ^AUG duplex. If true, the zinc ¢nger would also i constitute an important structural element signal for the release of the initiation complex. Determination of the threedimensional structure of aIF2L should help test this and other models of aIF2L function.
