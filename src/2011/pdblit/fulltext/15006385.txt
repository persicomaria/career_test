The emergence of multi-drug resistant bacterial isolates from clinical settings has made the search for new classes of antibacterial agents with novel modes of action of paramount importance. One of the new targets currently receiving widespread interest from both academic and industrial research groups is peptide deformylase (PDF).1 PDF is an iron-containing metalloenzyme responsible for the removal of the N-formyl group from the terminal methionine residue following protein synthesis in bacteria.2 As deformylation is necessary before further processing of the newly synthesised protein can occur, PDF is essential for bacterial growth. This, coupled with the observation that the gene encoding PDF (def) is present in all sequenced pathogenic bacterial genomes, has made PDF an attractive target for antibacterial chemotherapy. Recently, we described a structure­activity relationship (SAR) analysis of the pseudopeptide PDF inhibitor, BB-3497 (Fig. 1).3,4 Following this preliminary SAR evaluation, the P30 methyl ketone analogue (1) of BB3497 was selected as a lead compound for a new series of PDF inhibitors as it showed good inhibitory activity against the isolated PDF enzyme and retained some antibacterial activity despite the removal of the P20 -P30

amide bond. At the outset, we considered that the reduced peptidic nature of 1 compared to BB-3497 was an attractive feature that may offer significant advantages over more peptidic compounds in terms of metabolic stability and development potential. In this communication, we present a focused SAR study on PDF inhibitors containing a ketone group in the P30 position and report compounds with excellent in vitro antibacterial activity. From our earlier studies, we had established that the Nformyl hydroxylamine was the optimum metal-chelating group on the pseudopeptidic backbone of BB-3497.3 Additionally, we had found that substituents in the P10 position that mimicked the methionine residue in the natural substrate closely, such as n-butyl and cyclopentylmethyl, provided potent PDF inhibitors that displayed promising antibacterial activity.4a Consequently,

we elected to fix these optimised parameters, together with the t-butyl substituent in the P20 position4b (which we anticipated might offer some protection to both the amide and the ketone), in the design of our P30 ketone series. To access compounds in this P30 ketone series we developed convergent routes from either the Weinreb amide (2) or the pentafluorophenol (Pfp) ester (3) of NBoc-tert-Leu (Scheme 1). Thus, Grignard or alkyl/aryl lithium addition to 2 or 35 provided ketone 4. Removal of the N-Boc group with HCl/dioxane gave amine 5, which, in our preferred synthetic route, was coupled to carboxylic acid 66 (P10 =n-butyl or cyclopentylmethyl) activated using EDC and HOBt. The product from this reaction (not shown) was then subjected to palladiumcatalysed hydrogenation to reveal the N-formyl hydroxylamine 7.7

Following this study, we were particularly intrigued by the encouraging microbiological data for the P30 aryl ketones 7o (4-morpholinophenyl) and 7q (4-fluorophenyl). We recognised that the combination of a fluoro and an amino substituent on an aromatic ring had been used to develop SAR in other classes of antibacterials (notably the oxazolidinones10 and the quinolones11), with the effect of improving antibacterial activity and/or reducing metabolic liability. With this in mind, we were eager to investigate their combined potential as antibacterial fragments in our PDF inhibitors. A series of P30 4-aminoaryl ketones containing 0 (general formula 11) and 1 (general formula 12) fluorine substituent in the aromatic ring were synthesised in parallel from 8 and 9 respectively using SNAr chemistry (Scheme 2). Although the route that was used to access compounds 12 allowed diversification at the final step, the two-step route used for compounds 11 was preferred as it suffered from fewer side processes. A series of P30 2-aminoaryl ketones (general formula 13) using the same set of amines was also prepared via SNAr displacements on the corresponding trifluoroaryl ketone 10.12 All of the compounds prepared by these routes were purified by preparative HPLC at the final step.

Compounds were tested in an Escherichia coli PDF.Ni enzyme8 assay and in primary microbiology screens against in-house strains of E. coli and Staphylococcus capitis (S. capitis).9 Data from these assays on selected compounds is recorded in Table 1. An immediate improvement in PDF inhibition and antibacterial activity was observed when the methyl group in 1 was replaced with an aromatic or heteroaromatic group. Compounds 7a­s show excellent potency against the isolated PDF enzyme with nearly all examples inhibiting at levels below 10 nM, irrespective of the aromatic substituent in the P30 position. Interestingly, both electron-donating (e.g., 7i) and electron-withdrawing (e.g., 7r) substituents were tolerated on the aryl ring without conferring a significant difference in antibacterial activity. Additionally, we concluded that the cyclopentylmethyl group in the P10 position provided compounds that demonstrate at least a 2-fold improvement in S. capitis MIC's compared with the corresponding n-butyl analogues.

Concomitant to this medicinal chemistry programme, experiments to explore the mechanisms of resistance against PDF inhibitors were undertaken in our research group1d and by Margolis et al.13 These studies suggested that the fmt gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for N-formylation of methionine prior to protein synthesis is essential in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Consequently, deformylation is a necessary process for maturation of proteins in these pathogens. As S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are two of the major pathogens associated with respiratory tract infections (RTI's), we concluded that the PDF inhibitors were best suited to combat these types of infection. Our in vitro screening panel of bacteria was altered to reflect these observations and the P30 aminoaryl ketones

were tested against strains of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, which is also responsible for some RTI's (Table 2).14 From these microbiological results, we observe that the incorporation of a focused series of amines in the 2- or 4-position of the aromatic ketones is well tolerated by the enzyme. These compounds exert an excellent antibacterial effect against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, although additional basic residues (11c­ 13c and 11e­13e) in the amino substituent may cause a

slight drop in potency against Gram -ve strains. The presence of fluorine substituents in the aromatic ring does not appear to have a detrimental effect on the in vitro antibacterial profile of these PDF inhibitors. Further to this study, 7o and 13a were progressed for additional in vitro profiling15 against a panel of 104 organisms (Table 3). These compounds displayed an improved spectrum of activity compared with BB-3497 with 13a having an antibacterial profile comparable to amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC).

The natural ferrous-containing PDF enzyme oxidises readily to the inactive ferric form. Consequently, for ease of experimentation, we routinely test against the stable nickel-containing enzyme that retains full catalytic activity. 9.
