Mechanism of Proton Transport in Bacteriorhodopsin from Crystallographic Structures of the K, L, M1, M2, and M20 Intermediates of the Photocycle
Janos K. Lanyi* and Brigitte Schobert
Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California, 346D Medical Science I, Irvine, CA 92697 USA We produced the L intermediate of the photocycle in a bacteriorhodopsin crystal in photo-stationary state at 170 K with red laser illumination at ° 60% occupancy, and determined its structure to 1.62 A resolution. With this model, high-resolution structural information is available for the initial bacteriorhodopsin, as well as the first five states in the transport cycle. These states involve photo-isomerization of the retinal and its initial configurational changes, deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base and the coupled release of a proton to the extracellular membrane surface, and the switch event that allows reprotonation of the Schiff base from the cytoplasmic side. The six structural models describe the transformations of the retinal and its interaction with water 402, Asp85, and Asp212 in atomic detail, as well as the displacements of functional residues farther from the Schiff base. The changes provide rationales for how relaxation of the distorted retinal causes movements of water and protein atoms that result in vectorial proton transfers to and from the Schiff base.

Introduction
The light-driven proton pump, bacteriorhodopsin, is currently the best understood transmembrane ion transport system.1,2 The transport cycle ("photocycle") of this small retinal-protein is the linear reaction sequence of the K, L, M, N and O intermediates and their sub-states.3 The events after absorption of a photon can be divided into two phases: (i) the K ­L ­ M1 ­ M2 ­ M20 sequence in which the Schiff base of the photoisomerized 13-cis retinal donates its proton, in sequentially shifting equilibria toward complete transfer, to its counter-ion Asp85 and a proton is released to the extracellular surface; and (ii) the N ­ N0 ­ O ­ BR sequence after Asp96 reprotonates the Schiff base, in which proton uptake from the cytoplasmic surface reprotonates Asp96 to produce N, the retinal re-isomerizes to all-trans, and a proton is transferred from Asp85 to the proton release site.

The intermediates and the reactions of the photocycle have been described by static and timeresolved visible,3 Raman,4 FTIR5 ­ 7 and NMR8 spectroscopy utilizing a large number of site-specific mutations, and recently also by electron and X-ray crystallography. X-ray diffraction of 3D bacteriorhodopsin crystals, grown with the cubic phase method,9 has yielded a structural description of ° ° the non-illuminated protein to 1.90 A,10 1.55 A11 ° 12 resolution. Illuminating crystals of and 1.47 A the wild-type protein and mutants at temperatures between 100 K and 295 K produced photo-stationary states, from which structural changes in the K, L, and the various M states have been reported.12 ­ 19 Cryo-electron microscopy of illuminated 2D crystals, at lower resolution, described an outward tilt of the cytoplasmic end of helix F in the N intermediate.20 Structures for a late M and the O intermediates,21,22 also with large-scale conformational changes of helices, were proposed from crystallographic descriptions of two mutants in their non-illuminated states. The structural transformations of the retinal, together with the protein and water in its immediate vicinity, obviously play the key role in the way the steps leading toward thermal re-isomerization of the retinal drive the transport.

These changes are subtle, and in several cases need to be extracted from diffraction data after only partial conversion to the intermediate of interest. For these reasons, high crystallographic resolutions ° (1.43 A) have been helpful in solving the structures of the K and the M1 states at occupancies of 40% and 60%, respectively,12,19 We now report on the ° structure of the L state, at 1.62 A resolution and 60% occupancy. The structural models for the M2 and M20 states15,16 were determined earlier from dif° ° fraction data to 1.8 A and 2.0 A, respectively, but after full conversion to these intermediates. Together with the non-illuminated state, the six structures now available define the mechanism of the first phase of the pump at an atomic level, up to the time when recovery of the initial state begins with reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base.

Results and Discussion
Structural changes in the L state The L intermediate could be accumulated in a photo-stationary state by illuminating the crystals

with a red laser, at either 150 K or 170 K. Figure 1 shows spectra for a single crystal under such conditions. Comparison with difference spectra for authentic L and M at cryogenic temperatures23 indicates that at 150 K about 30% of bacteriorhodopsin is converted to L, and at 170 K about 55% L is produced plus about 10% M. As an approximation, we refined the diffraction data after illumination at 150 K and 170 K with 30% and 60% occupancies, respectively, and with two conformations present, i.e. BR and L. Table 1 gives refinement statistics for a crystal illuminated at ° 170 K that diffracted to 1.62 A. Detecting the photo-isomerization of the retinal in L is an obvious and useful criterion in evaluating the goodness of the data. The effect of illumination is illustrated in Figure 2, that is a difference map of Fobs (illuminated) minus Fobs (non-illluminated) at the retinal. Although the changes are small, and the contouring is therefore at a lower level than usual in difference maps, the appearance of negative density below the C13 ­ C14 double bond and positive density above, without bias from refinement, suggests atomic

displacements at the location where photo-isomerization is expected. Negative peaks below C13 and C9, and positive peaks above C20 and C19, as well as negative peaks along the side-chain of Lys216 and the retinal, indicate additional but smaller changes in this vicinity. It is clear from the small changes shown in Figure 2 that, as expected, the retinal conformations in L and BR overlap considerably, and refinement of the models must be done with care. As for the K and M1 states,12,19 we have taken pains to avoid errors from stereochemical restraints and model bias. In the refinement, restraints on bond angles along the Lys216/retinal segment of CB-CG-CD-CE-NZ-C15 ­C14 ­C13 were removed entirely. Figure 3 shows stereo views of 2Fobs 2 Fcalc electron density maps at the retinal for a crystal illuminated at 170 K (Figure 3(b)), and for a nonilluminated crystal (Figure 3(a)). The latter is a control with two overlapping conformations, one fixed as BR with 40% occupancy and the other refined, in the same way as the model for the illuminated crystal (cf. Materials and Methods). To avoid bias, these are omit maps, constructed without phase contribution from the atoms along the CB-CG-CDCE-NZ-C15 ­C14 ­C13 ­ C20 segment in either of the two conformations. The refined model for the second conformation in the illuminated crystal (the putative L state; Figure 3(b)), is clearly 13cis,15-anti, while in the non-illuminated control the second model is all-trans, as expected.

Diffraction was measured for two additional crystals at 170 K, and three crystals at 150 K, and models were refined independently for each data set. Figure 4 shows the retinal in BR, as well as in the three L state models from 170 K. The atomic positions of the retinal in L show non-negligible crystal-to-crystal variability, as in the K state reported recently.12 Thus, conclusions concerning the retinal geometry have to take into account the magnitude of the uncertainties in the structure. In the following we attempt to estimate these uncertainties. Table 2 shows the crystal-to-crystal reproducibility of the positions of atoms in L in the Lys216/ retinal segment CD-CE-NZ-C15 ­C14 ­ C13, where most of the changes from the BR state occur. The averages of the distances of the listed atoms from their mean positions reflect the scatter in the six data sets collected. For several atoms, the positional error is greater for the 150 K data, as expected from the lower occupancy of L at this temperature (Figure 1). For the 170 K data, the ° average crystal-to-crystal variation is about 0.2 A. Another estimate of coordinate noise is from atomic displacements between the L and the BR states at various locations in the protein. Table 3 shows rmsd values between the models for L and BR, for main-chain and side-chain portions of numerous residues and for the CD-CE-NZ-C15 ­ C14 ­ C13 segment of the Lys-216/retinal chain. The residues were chosen to include some near the

Maps are shown for a non-illuminated crystal (a) and a crystal illuminated at 170 K (b), both calculated without phase contribution from the CB-CG-CDCE-NZ-C15 ­C14 ­ C13 ­ C20 segment. The models contain two conformations. In (b), the second conformation, with 60% weight, is the putative L state. In (a) that is a control map, the second conformation is BR, as the first, and the differences between the BR model and the sham conformation give an estimate of coordinate error from the partial occupancy refinement.

retinal but on various helices as indicated (Asp85, Trp86, Leu93, Met118, Trp182, Asp212, and Val217), and others in peripheral positions (Phe42, Arg82, Asp96, and Phe219). Some of these residues have been implicated in function, while others not. There are two kinds of residues. The first group, shown in Table 3 in bold, includes Phe42, Arg82, Phe219, and the Lys216/retinal segment. The side° chain rmsd value in this group is 0.5 2 0.7 A, and their displacements are potentially real. The second group comprises the rest, and because they exhibit rmsd values well below the first group we assume that their displacements are either error or real but of doubtful significance. In general, the rmsd values given in Table 3 are consistent with the ° crystal-to-crystal reproducibility of about 0.2 A in Table 2. We conclude that the atomic displacements ° at Lys216 and the retinal, that average nearly 0.7 A (Table 3), are well above the average variability of coordinates in different regions of the protein, and among different crystals. Describing the changed geometry of the retinal region in L was the main motivation for this work. The differences between BR and L include a wider bond angle at C12 ­C13yC14, and rotated torsion angles of the C13yC14, C14 ­ C15, and C15yNZ bonds in the L state (Table 4). As shown in Table 4, the

changes in L are slightly different at 150 K and 170 K. The bond angle at C12 ­ C13yC14 is increased from 112­ 1138 in BR to 141(^ 9)8 at 150 K and 129(^ 9)8 at 170 K. Although the errors will be larger for the model at 150 K, we ignored the difference at the two temperatures: an average of the six values, 135(^ 10)8, seems a fair representation of the change in L. The C13yC14 bond, which is a twisted trans in BR at 154 ­1578 (i.e. deviates somewhat from the expected 1808), is a twisted 13cis in L, at 28(^ 9)8. The C14 ­C15 bond torsion is less changed, but the C15yNZ bond is rotated strongly counterclockwise. Suggestively, in L small atomic displacements around water 402 appear to make the sum of the lengths of the two hydrogen bonds over which the Schiff base proton will be transferred, i.e. NZH to O of water 402 plus O of water 402 to OD2 of Asp85, somewhat shorter. This distance is between ° ° 4.61 A and 4.64 A in BR, not changed at ° ° in K,12 but 4.37(^ 0.08) A in L. The 4.71(^ 0.28) A ° decrease of about 0.3 A is only slightly over the coordinate error (Tables 2 and 3), but given the well-defined geometry of residues in the retinal region it may be a real change. Some rmsd values given in Table 3 suggest that there may be changes in L also at locations away

from the retinal. Arg82 exhibits an apparent displacement larger than average. In view of the fact ° that the Arg82 side-chain flips by 2 A, or more, away from the region of Asp85 and Asp212 in the M states,16,17 this movement is worth examining. However, in L the end of the arginine side-chain is hardly displaced relative to these aspartate residues.

° CZ of Arg82 and CG of Asp85 is 8.50(^ 0.01) A in ° and 8.71 A. We ° L, while in BR it is between 8.48 A conclude that, in spite of a large rmsd value (Table 3), there is no coordinated movement of Arg82 that resembles the movement in the subsequent M states. In contrast, the movements of two phenyl rings near Asp96, those of Phe42 and Phe219 (Table 3), appear to be significant. Figure 5 shows 2Fobs ­ Fcalc omit maps (constructed without phases from Phe42, Thr46, Asp96, and Phe219) of this region. The displacements of the two rings are greater in the illuminated than in the non-illuminated crystal. Further, these displacements are made meaningful by the fact that Thr46, Asp96, and Leu97 in their vicinity show no movement. In L, the phenyl ring of Phe42 approaches the carboxyl O of Asp96, and the ring of Phe219 moves away from its carboxyl OH. The distance of the closest atom of the phenyl ring of Phe42 to the carboxyl O of Asp96 is ° ° decreased from 3.29 A to 3.47 A in BR to ° in L (standard deviation is from 2.94(^ 0.13) A crystal-to-crystal differences in the data sets at 170 K). The closest atom of the ring of Phe219 moves away from the carboxyl OH of Asp96, from ° 3.62 to 3.64 in BR to 4.29(^ 0.28) A in L. These changes may explain the shift of the CyO stretch of Asp96 (reviews5,24) with the changed dipole environment of this protonated aspartic acid. There are many discrepancies in the refined model from the structure reported earlier14,25,26 for the L state. The retinal had been shown with a non-twisted configuration, the Schiff base N ­H bond pointing toward the cytoplasmic direction. Water 402 was not detected. The side-chain of Arg82 was shown as flipped, away from Asp85 and toward Glu194. The side-chains of Trp182 and Tyr83 were found to have moved. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 3, and the discussion above, our data do not support any of these structural

changes. The most important conclusion14,25,26 from the earlier investigation was that in the L state the proton donor Schiff base approaches the proton acceptor Asp85, in preparation for the critical proton transfer in the L ! M reaction. The decreased distance would be the consequence of electrostatic attraction between the positively charged protonated Schiff base and the anionic Asp85 that causes the "bowing" of part of helix C toward the Schiff base. We must point out that neither the earlier14 coordinate set for L (1E0P) nor our current one show evidence for the approach of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp85, or its CA atom, toward the Schiff base nitrogen (Table 5).

Conformational dynamics of the retinal up to reprotonation of the Schiff base Together with the structure of the L state reported here, all of the intermediate states before Schiff base reprotonation have been determined. The changes in these states most relevant to transport will be at and near the retinal. In Table 6 the bond angle at C13 and the three torsion angles between C12 and NZ are listed for BR, K, L, M1, M2, and M20 . The C12 ­ C13yC14 bond angle is increased from 112 ­1138 to 145(^ 12)8 in K, and as the protein passes through the five intermediate states shown, it gradually recovers its initial value

in M20 . Photoisomerization of the C13yC14 bond is complete in K, as the torsion angle is near zero as expected for 13-cis. In L this bond becomes somewhat twisted, but the unstrained 13-cis bond recovers in the M1 state and remains so in M2 and M20 . The C14 ­ C15 bond undergoes limited counterclockwise rotation in K, which is sustained in L and M1 but reverses in M2 to near the initial 1808 and undergoes no further change in M20 . The C15yNZ bond is rotated counterclockwise in K, rotated further in L, but returns in M1 to near its configuration in K, and then approaches the expected 1808 of the 15-anti configuration in M2 and M20 . These complex rearrangements greatly alter the geometry of the retinal relative to its surroundings. Figure 6 shows the retinal with the connected Lys216 and water 402 in BR, K, L, M1, M2, and M20 . In the K state there is little change in the overall contour of the retinal, but the direction of the Schiff base NZ ­H bond relative to water 402 is changed.12 In BR the NZ ­ H· · ·O angle is 140 ­ 1478, but in K these atoms form a more acute angle at 116(^ 15)8. In L the bond rotations of the retinal (Table 6) return the N ­H bond closer into line with O (the NZ ­H· · ·O angle increases again, to 132(^ 9)8). The putative path of the proton, from NZHþ to OD2 of Asp85 via water 402 decreases by ° about 0.3 A, a small change but one that may be significant. After deprotonation, the Schiff base nitrogen in M1 retains, roughly, the orientation toward the extracellular side it had in L, but in M2 the plane of the C14 ­ NZyCE segment is rotated toward the cytoplasmic side, and this direction remains in M20 . In M1 water 402 is moved, by ° about 1 A, away from NZ.19 It continues to form hydrogen bonds with Asp85 and Asp212 but no longer with the deprotonated Schiff base. This water molecule is not detectable in the M2 and M20 states that follow. In M2, and even more in M20 , the retinal skeleton is increasingly bent at C13, as the distorted C12 ­C13yC14 bond angle relaxes (Figure 6 and Table 6). The result is that in M20 the 13-methyl group is thrust in the cytoplasmic direction, where the indole ring of Trp182 is located.15 The bent configuration of retinal in M20 , with all torsion angles at their nominal values for 13-cis,15-anti and the Schiff base nitrogen atom fully rotated toward the cytoplasmic side, is near what it would be in free solution.16

A great deal of information about the retinal in these states is available from vibrational and NMR spectroscopy, and some are in good agreement with the changes we report here. The coupling of NZ ­ H in-plane bend and the C15yNZ stretch, present in the BR state, nearly completely disappears in K, but reappears in L.27,28 The weaker interaction of the Schiff base in K may be now attributed to the development of a very unfavorable angle for its hydrogen bond to water 402, which is partly relieved in L. The strong hydrogen-out-of-plane (HOOP) band of C15 ­H in K and its lowered amplitude in L28 are consistent with a greater displacement of C15 from the plane of the conjugated retinal chain in K than in L. The C14 ­C15 bond in L is anti29,30 although strained,31 as in the structure reported here. However, the insensitivity of the Raman band of the C14 ­ C15 stretch to N-deuteration had suggested that the C15yNZ configuration in L is anti rather than syn.32 It remains to be seen whether the twisted 15-syn configuration (torsion angle of C15yNZ of about 508; Table 6) in the distorted retinal of L is consistent with the observed lack of coupling between the C14 ­ C15 stretch and the NZ ­ H rock that had argued for 15-anti. From solid state NMR8 it appears that the bond that undergoes the greatest torsion is C15yNZ, as we find in the crystallographic structure (Table 6). The decreased distance between C20 (13-methyl carbon) and NE1 of Trp182 from solid state NMR in an early M state argued33 for the upward movement of the 13-methyl group. In these measurements, NE1 of Trp182 decreased from ° ° 3.36(^ 0.2) A in BR to 3.16(^ 0.4) A, in the early M state. Such a change is consistent with the crystallographic structures and the gradual decrease of this inter-atomic distance from BR to K, to L, and to M1. As the indole ring begins to tilt in response to the pressure of C20, the decrease halts in M2 and reverses in M20 . The distances are: between 3.32 ° ° and 3.35 A in BR, 3.18(^ 0.09) A in K, ° ° 3.11(^ 0.10) A in L, and 3.03(^ 0.02) A in M1 (the standard deviations are crystal-to-crystal vari° ations). The distance remains unchanged at 3.08 A ° in M2, and increases to 3.55 A in M20 . These changes are small but may be real, because the Trp182 side-chain is firmly fixed (Table 3), and the upward thrust of the 13-methyl group of the retinal is a well-defined movement (Figure 6). However, the changes we detect in L do not

provide an explanation for the greatly increased amplitude of the N ­H stretch band of the Trp182 indole ring in L (reviews5,24). Structural basis of the proton transport The configurational changes of the retinal shown in Figure 6 must have the rationale that they cause the deprotonation of the Schiff base toward the extracellular side, and then ensure that its reprotonation is from the cytoplasmic side. The crystallographic structures of the intermediates provide an atomic level mechanism to accomplish this. The changes of the retinal and its protein environment are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 7 shows the retinal, Lys216, water molecules 401 and 402, Asp85, Asp212, Trp182, and Arg82 in BR, K, L, M1, M2, and M20 . Kinetic studies have produced the scheme, BR-hn ! K $ L $ M1 $ M2 $ M20 þ Hþ for this phase of the photocycle,34,35 where the M2 $ M20 þ Hþ equilibrium refers to proton release to the extracellular surface upon protonation of Asp85, through coupling of this aspartate residue to the release site at the Glu194 ­ Glu204 pair.36,37 M20 may be equivalent to MN.38 The structural models for K,12 L, and M119 are from wildtype bacteriorhodopsin, for M2 it is from the E204Q mutant in which proton release is blocked,16 and for M20 from the D96N mutant in which reprotonation of the Schiff base is slowed greatly.15 With the assumption that these structures, determined from photo-stationary states in 3D crystals and shown in Figures 6 and 7, resemble the transient states produced at ambient temperature after flash illumination of membranes, we can give a detailed mechanism for the proton transport as follows. The structural transformations describe the K to M20 phase of the photocycle as the progressive relaxation of the initially constrained and twisted 13-cis retinal in K to yield a strain-free 13-cis,15anti configuration in M20 . The K state, the first well-described intermediate after photo-isomerization of the retinal, is a high-energy state. About half of the excess energy gained resides in the distorted bond angle at C13 (Table 6),12 and the rest must be in the bond torsions along the retinal between C14 and NZ, and increased charge separation between water 402 and NZHþ from the weakening of the hydrogen bond between the Schiff base and water 402 (Figure 6). The retinal is distorted because the protein matrix resists accommodation of the changed geometry upon its photo-isomerization. Relaxation from K cannot occur directly, because proton transfer to water

Positive torsion angles refer to clockwise rotation from 08 up to 1808 when viewed from the b-ionone ring, negative torsion angles to counterclockwise rotation.

402 (and thence to OD2 of Asp85), that would break the electrostatic interaction of the Schiff base with its counter-ion,39 is hindered by the acute angle of the NZ ­ H· · ·O atoms (Figure 6). In the L state this problem is solved by rotation of the C13yC14 and C15yNZ bonds (Table 6) that return the NZ ­ H· · ·O hydrogen bond closer to colinearity, and perhaps by atomic displacements that shorten the path for proton transfer to Asp85 via water 402. The protonation equilibrium between the Schiff base and Asp85, that ensues, produces the M1 state in which the retinal resembles K but contains a deprotonated Schiff base and a less distorted C13 bond angle. Water 402 moves away from the unprotonated Schiff base, breaking connection of NZ with Asp85 and Asp212. The L $ M1 equilibrium still favors the protonated Schiff base,34,35 but will be shifted

toward more extensive deprotonation by further relaxation of the retinal in M2. In M2 water 402 is no longer detected. The Schiff base nitrogen atom, having lost its electrostatic interaction with the counter-ion,8,39 and its hydrogen bond,19 in M1, is free to rotate toward the cytoplasmic direction. The M1 to M2 reaction, deduced initially from the kinetics,34,35 and a small shift in the absorption maximum of the M state,40,41 is now recognized to be a geometric change that acts as the switch between deprotonation and reprotonation in the pump. This is equivalent to the "torsion-based switch" suggested earlier.8 Presumably, the new direction of the Schiff base will facilitate its reprotonation by Asp96 on the cytoplasmic side, through a hydrogen bonded chain of water that is generally assumed to form in the N intermediate. Perturbation of the

The image of the BR state is shown with low opacity under each changed conformation. Colors, the position of the hydrogen atoms, and the coordinate sets, are as for Figure 6.

448 cytoplasmic region in M20 is initiated by repacking of the side-chains between helices F and G in response to changes in the conformation of the Lys216 side-chain and the p-bulge it forms in helix G,16 and by the thrust of the 13-methyl group against the indole ring of Trp182 (Figure 7). The resulting tilt of Trp182 breaks its connection with the CyO of Ala215 via water 501, i.e. the link between helices F and G near the retinal.16 Reaching the near fully relaxed retinal configuration of M20 depends on dissociation of the extracellular proton release site. The proton release is coupled to protonation of Asp85 by shuttling of the side-chain of Arg82 between an inward and an outward position.15 ­ 17 This will raise the pKa value of Asp85 by four to five units, and act as an affinity-based switch that prevents return of the proton from Asp85 to the Schiff base.36,37 Figure 7 shows that Arg82 moves in M2 already. Evidently, the release of the proton requires additional events after the approach of the positively charged guanidinium group toward the release site, as suggested also by the large and complex deuterium isotope effect on the release kinetics.42 In summary, removal of bond strain in the photoisomerized retinal and steric conflict between the retinal and its binding site is made possible by induced stepwise displacements of protein residues and water. These displacements represent selective and timed compliance of the various parts of the retinal binding site, that ultimately accommodates the changing shape of the 13-cis,15-anti retinal. The first result of this process is that a proton is transferred from the Schiff base to Asp85 via water 402 over the hydrogen bonds that bridge them, and a proton is released to the surface through the mediation of Arg82. The second is that the unprotonated Schiff base rotates away from the protonated acceptor, and toward the putative proton donor Asp96, ensuring thereby the vectoriality of the proton translocation.

handled as follows. First, a reference coordinate set was created by refining the BR state (coordinate set 1M0L) as a rigid body against the data, using residues 5 ­ 20 as the means of aligning the model with the densities. Second, another model with a single conformation was refined. This refinement was continued with two protein conformations, one being the fixed reference model with a weight of 40% (BR), and the other variable with a weight of 60% (L), consistent with the difference spectrum in Figure 1(C). The lipids were refined with a single conformation. For the retinal between C13 and C15, and for Lys216 between CB and NZ, restraints for bond angles were removed entirely, and elsewhere greatly loosened as before.12,19 The refinement was repeated numerous times with various initial configurations of the retinal, including all-trans, and in all cases essentially the same configuration was returned. Another series of trials, with different weights for L, indicated that near 60% L the refined retinal geometry is only moderately sensitive to the input occupancy. Further, the retinal geometry in L was not altered when only Lys216 plus the retinal were modeled with two conformations, independent of other parts of the protein, as before.12,19 A total of six such data sets were collected and refined, from three crystals after illumination at 150 K (with L occupancy of 30%), and another three after illumination at 170 K (with L occupancy of 60%). As control, data from a nonilluminated crystal12 were refined in the same way, with one conformation fixed as BR at 40% weight, and the other refined as L in the illuminated crystals. Difference refinement between an illuminated and a non-illuminated crystal could not be done because each crystal had a different twin ratio. Instead, Fobs maps were calculated from both illuminated and non-illuminated reflection files with the phases from the BR model, the maps were normalized, and one map was subtracted from the other to produce an Fobs minus Fobs map.

Materials and Methods
Data collection Crystals of wild-type bacteriorhodopsin were grown with the cubic phase method.9 The hexagonal plates were about 80 m £ 80 m £ 10 mm, with space group P63. ° The unit cell dimensions were a ¼ b ¼ 60.80 A, ° c ¼ 107.78 A. After mounting the crystal in a loop and freezing in liquid nitrogen, it was illuminated with a HeNe laser (10 mW, 633 nm) for 60 seconds at 170 K. Diffraction was then measured at 100 K, on beamline 8.2.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS, LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory). The reflections were recorded with a Quantum-210 CCD camera. A total of 150 frames, with an oscillation angle of 0.608 were collected, and the data were integrated and merged with the program HKL2000.43 Refinement Refinement was with SHELXL-97,44 taking merohedral twinning into account.
