ABSTRACT We determined the solution structure of a 22-amino-acid peptide from the amino-terminal domain of the bacteriophage 21 N protein in complex with its cognate 24-mer boxB RNA hairpin using heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The N peptide binds as an -helix and interacts predominately with the major groove side of the 5 half of the boxB RNA stem-loop. This binding interface is defined by surface complementarity of polar and nonpolar interactions, and little sequence-specific recognition. The 21 boxB loop (CUAACC) has hydrogen bond and backbone torsions typical of the "U-turn" motif, as well as base stacking of the last 4 nt, and a hydrogen bonded C:C pair closing the loop. The exposed face of the 21 boxB loop, in complex with the N peptide, is strikingly similar to the GNRA tetraloop-like folds of the related and P22 bacteriophage N peptide­boxB RNA complexes. The N peptide­boxB complexes of the various phage, while individually distinct, provide similar structural features for interactions with the Escherichia coli host factors to enable antitermination. Keywords: Transcription antitermination; bacteriophage N protein; NMR spectroscopy; U-turn; protein/RNA interactions

INTRODUCTION The Lambda family of bacteriophage ( , 21, and P22) use a temporally programmed sequence of gene expression during infection that is controlled, in part, by termination and antitermination of transcription. These bacteriophage all use N proteins, N-utilization (nut) sites in the nascent mRNA, and transcription terminators, to regulate early transcription. The interaction between the phage-encoded N protein and the RNA nut site plays a central role in the organization of viral and host factors (Nus proteins) required for formation of a termination resistant form of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcription complex (Das 1993; Greenblatt et al. 1993; Friedman and Court 1995). The nut site is composed of a single-stranded 5 -boxA site and a 3 -boxB RNA hairpin, separated by a variable length linker region of 8­14 nt (Fig. 1A,B; Szybalski et al. 1986). The organization of the genome is conserved between phage types, but the sequences of the RNA nut sites and N proteins are diverse (Franklin 1985a). The boxA sequences are highly homologous between the related phage and have

been shown to bind host-encoded NusB and ribosomal protein S10 (Olson et al. 1984; Horwitz et al. 1987; Nodwell and Greenblatt 1993). The boxB hairpins consist of short stems (5­7 bp) and 5- or 6-nt loops and have little sequence homology between the three phages. Point mutations in boxB loop sequences have been shown to abolish antitermination in vivo (Doelling and Franklin 1989; Chattopadhyay et al. 1995) and N binding in vitro (Cilley and Williamson 1997). The three related phage N proteins are all small (96­107 amino acids), basic proteins that only function with their cognate nut-boxB RNAs (Lazinski et al. 1989). Amino acid sequence alignment of the N proteins from , 21, and P22 shows an amino-terminal, arginine-rich, 18-amino-acid region of homology with four invariant residues (Fig. 1C; Franklin 1985b). In vivo and in vitro studies show peptides from this region specifically bind the appropriate boxB hairpins (Lazinski et al. 1989; Tan and Frankel 1995), with affinities similar to full-length N protein (Cilley and Williamson 1997). The N protein binds to one face of the boxB hairpin (Chattopadhyay et al. 1995), whereas Escherichia coli elongation factor NusA binds the opposite face (Mogridge et al. 1995) and interacts directly with N (Van Gilst and von Hippel 1997). The solution structures of the N peptide­boxB RNA complex have been solved for the phages (Legault et al. 1998) 663

(B) Sequence alignment of the three phage nut RNAs. The boxB loop nucleotides are shown in blue italics. (C) Sequence alignment of the amino-terminal domains of the three phage N proteins. The four conserved residues are highlighted in green.

This structure completes the family of three -related phage N-boxB protein­RNA structures that have been genetically characterized. All three peptides bind the RNA helical stems using polar and nonpolar contacts that are almost superimposable. Peptide interactions with their respective RNA hairpin loops diverge from this structural similarity, and all three peptides show loop-specific interactions. The pentanucleotide loops of and P22 adopt GNRA-type tetraloop structures with exclusion of 1 of the 5 nt. The 21 boxB hexanucleotide loop contains a U-turn that is structurally related to the GNRA tetraloop (Jucker and Pardi 1995), a mismatched C10:C15 base pair, and stacking of C14, giving the 21 complex a structure similar in shape and exposed surface groups to the N peptide­ boxB complex. Comparison of the 21 complex to those of and P22 reveals how phage type-specificity is maintained in the presence of conserved host factor interactions, through similar peptide-RNA stem binding motifs coupled with loop-specific interactions that yield similar RNA loop structures. RESULTS Minimal peptide/RNA complex The N-nut complexes from and P22 were minimized to short N peptides containing the amino-terminal basic domain and short RNA hairpins corresponding to boxB (Tan and Frankel 1995). As a starting point for defining a similar minimal system for 21, we began with the 41 aminoterminal residues of 21 N protein and a 49-nt nut site RNA. The affinity of this interaction was determined using a polyacrylamide coelectrophoresis (PACE) assay (Cilley and Williamson 1999) with a Kd,app of 135 nM. The 21 nut RNA was minimized to just the boxB hairpin, and this minimal 24-nt hairpin binds to the 41-mer peptide with the same affinity, 82 nM (Fig. 2A). To identify the minimal N 21 peptide, a series of Nterminal and C-terminal deletion peptides were prepared (Fig. 2B) and assayed. The resulting 22-amino-acid peptide spans the basic region homologous to and P22 bound to the boxB RNA hairpin and has a Kd,app of 200 nM, less than twofold down from the 21 N(1­41)­nut RNA complex. The three N-nut complexes exhibit phage type specificity in vivo. Each N protein has a strong preference for its cognate RNA, and it is the amino terminus of the N protein that confers this type specificity (Lazinski et al. 1989). We determined the complete matrix of in vitro binding affinities of each N peptide for each boxB RNA using the PACE assay (Fig. 3; Table 1). Binding affinity in vitro reflects type specificity, consistent with the in vivo experiments. The three cognate N peptide-boxB RNA complexes have a 20fold range in binding affinities. The individual peptides and RNAs demonstrate a wide range of binding specificity for cognate versus noncognate complexes. The N peptide and

and P22 (Cai et al. 1998). Both structures show a bent -helical peptide bound to one face of an RNA hairpin loop. A number of polar and nonpolar interactions are observed with few, if any, involved in sequence-specific contacts in either of the structures. Each hairpin has a pentanucleotide loop that adopts a GNRA-type tetraloop fold with the fourth or third nucleotide flipped out of the loop in and P22, respectively. Here, we describe the solution structure of the 21 NboxB consisting of an amino-terminal 22-amino-acid N peptide in complex with a 24-nt boxB RNA by NMR methods. The boxB hairpin has an A-form helical stem with a hexanucleotide loop (5 -CUAACC-3 ) with the last four bases continuously stacking on the 3 half of the hairpin stem. The loop residues U11-A12-A13 form a "U-turn," first described in yeast tRNAphe (Quigley and Rich 1976) and also observed in ribosomal RNA loops (Fountain et al. 1996; Huang et al. 1996; Conn et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2001), and the hammerhead ribozyme (Pley et al. 1994). The U-turn consensus sequence, UNR, is characterized by a hydrogen bond between the U imino proton and the 5­ phosphate of the nucleotide following the UNR, and a second hydrogen bond between the U 2 hydroxyl and the N7 of the R nucleotide. U-turns are commonly flanked by noncanonical Y:Y base pairs (Auffinger and Westhof 1999; Gutell et al. 2000). A core 13-amino-acid region of N 21 peptide binds as an -helix and interacts predominately with both the major groove side of the 5 half of the ascending upper stem, and the loop of the boxB hairpin. Electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions exist all along the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. 664

(Hu et al. 1998). These through-bond experiments were combined with sequential assignment of the RNA from two-dimensional (2D) NOESY experiments in both H2O and D2O to allow for the complete assignment of the nucleotide spin systems. A pair of 2D HCN spectra were collected to directly establish ribose-to-base connectivities (Table 2). These experiments correlate a base N1/N9 to the ribose H1 or the base H6/H8 to the N1/N9. These connectivities served as a check on the sequential assignments from NOESY analysis. Finally, an HNN-COSY experiment (Dingley and Grzesiek 1998) provided direct evidence for the base pairing in the stem. Distance restraints for structure calculations were derived from a variety of NOESY experiments (Table 2). Use of

FIGURE 2. boxB RNA and N peptide minimization for NMR structural studies. (A) The full nut site was truncated and tested for binding against the full-length 41-amino-acid N 21 peptide. The binding affinities of the RNAs were directly compared against one another in a single PACE gel. (B) Deletions were made from both ends of the 41-amino-acid peptide. The relative binding affinity of all of the peptides for boxB 21 were compared in a single PACE gel in which each peptide was cast in the gel at 300 nM concentration. The migration distance of boxB 21 RNA in each lane was compared to that of the N 21 41-amino-acid peptide to evaluate loss of binding affinity.

the boxB RNA each show about a 300-fold range in binding affinities (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the NP22 peptide and boxBP22 RNA are the least discriminating, showing at most a fourfold preference for cognate sequences (Fig. 3B), whereas N 21 peptide and boxB 21 RNA have a more intermediate 15-fold specificity (Fig. 3C). NMR structure determination The solution structure of the 21 N peptide­boxB RNA complex was solved with standard heteronuclear NMR experiments, using both 15N and 13C, 15N-labeled peptide and RNA (see Material and Methods; Table 2). Complex formation was monitored using 15N- or 13C-HSQC experiments. The 15N-HSQC spectra contains a single set of peaks for a 1:1 complex of 15N-peptide and unlabeled boxB RNA, distinct from the set of peaks for the 15N-peptide only (Fig. 4A). Sequential and unambigious assignment of all of the peptide 1H, 13C, and 15N backbone and side chain chemical shifts was achieved using triple resonance through-bond correlation experiments (Table 2). The resonances of the backbone amides were well dispersed in both the 1H and 15 N dimensions, and there were few problems with spectral overlap in these experiments. The boxB ribose spin systems were assigned using three-dimensional HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY, and HCCH-COSY-TOCSY experiments

The core, ordered region of the peptide­RNA complex is evident in the superposition of the 14 low energy structures (Fig. 5B). The average structure of this low energy ensemble was minimized to obtain the final solution structure (Fig. 6A,B; Table 3, Panel B). Peptide structure in complex The N 21 peptide in complex with the boxB RNA forms an -helix spanning residues Ala13­Ala26, with the remaining residues in an extended conformation. The measured and angles for the amino acids Ala13­Ala26 fall within the -helical regions of the Ramachandran plot (Morris et al. 1992). The conserved residues Ala13, Arg16, Arg20, and Arg21 of the N peptide family do not appear to lie on a single face of the -helix, but they are all oriented towards the binding surface of the boxB RNA (Fig. 6A).

The N peptide showed sequential NOE connectivities in 15N-NOESY spectra typical of an -helical structure. Similarly, the boxB RNA had intra- and internucleotide NOE patterns indicative of A-form helical regions of a stem-loop structure.

chains can be resolved in the N peptide structure. In the -helical portion of the peptide, all side chains with potential hydrogen bond donor moieties are oriented on one face of the helix, whereas the potential hydrogen bond acceptor side chains lie mostly on the opposite face. All of the peptide side chains that gave rise to NOE distance restraints (Fig. 5A) lie along the 5 -side of the major groove of the upper 4 bp of the stem and behind the loop of boxB RNA (Fig. 6B). The nonhelical regions of the N peptide, Glu8 to Thr12 and Glu27 to Arg29, are randomly oriented away from the boxB RNA. These residues had few interresidue NOEs and no NOEs to the boxB RNA. Deletion analysis showed that a peptide truncated at Thr12, just before the conserved Ala13, bound the boxB RNA with less affinity than a peptide truncated at Glu8 (Fig. 2B). The first seven amino acids of full-length N 21 contain a number of hydrophobic residues, including two valines, an isoleucine, and a tryptophan (Fig. 1C). Although not important for RNA binding, these residues may play a role in subsequent N protein folding, or contribute to protein­protein interactions in the complete antitermination complex. boxB structure in complex The 21 boxB RNA in complex with the N peptide adopts a stem-loop structure (Fig. 6A). The stem of the boxB RNA contains seven Watson­Crick base pairs and two canonical wobble U:G base pairs, U3:G22 and U9:G16. The stem is

essentially A-form helical, with no significant perturbations of ribose sugar puckers or base glycosidic torsion angles. In the hexanucleotide loop of boxB RNA (CUAACC), the four bases on the 3 end stack upon the 3 strand of the helical stem. Cytidine-15, located at the 3 end of the hexanucleotide loop, stacks on G16, the 3 base in the U9:G16 base pair at the top of the stem. This stacking in the hexanucleotide loop continues upward with nucleotides C14, A13, and A12, extending the topology of an A-form helix up to the tip of the loop. The U11-A12-A13 U-turn facilitates reversal of the direction of the phosphate backbone. Although the imino proton of U11 is not observed in the NMR experiments, 11 of the 14 structures show hydrogen bonds between this imino and the phosphate of C14, a hallmark of the U-turn motif. Similarly, a hydrogen bond between the 2 hydroxyl of U11 and the N7 of A13 is observed in 13 of the 14 low energy structures. In 12 of the 14 low energy structures, the N4-amino group of C15 can hydrogen bond to either the N3 or O2 of C10. The C10:C15 pair stacks on the U9:G16 base pair. This C10:C15 pairing can only be inferred indirectly because there are no observed resonances from any of the N4-amino protons, indicating the lack of a stable hydrogen bond. Electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions One-third of all residues in the N 21 peptide are either lysine or arginine. The N 21 peptide belongs to a loose class

of protein sequences containing the "arginine-rich motif" (Weiss and Narayana 1998). Members of this "class" have ultimately shown little sequence or structural-specific homology, but all use arginine side chains in binding and recognition of the RNA major groove. In the N 21 peptide­ boxB RNA complex, all but one of the five arginines and one of the three lysines make extensive contacts with the phosphate backbone (Fig. 7A). The guanidinium groups of the conserved arginines, Arg16, Arg20, and Arg21, are within 5 Å of the phosphate backbone on the 5 -ascending stem of the boxB RNA. The guanidinium group of Arg28 is more distant from the phosphate of A12, but could still contribute a favorable electrostatic interaction in the complex. The amino group of Lys18 is within 5 Å of the phosphate group of C14 on the opposite side of the groove. Analysis of the family of low energy structures indicates that some of these 668

guanidinium and amino groups may be making stronger ionic interactions, or even hydrogen bonds, to the phosphate backbone. Although not as apparent in the average structure (Fig. 7A), in all 14 structures the guanidinium group of Arg16 is <2.4 Å from the nonbridging phosphate oxygens of C7 and C8, in many cases close to both phosphate groups. Similarly, the amino group of Lys18 is close to the phosphate of C14 in 13 of the 14 structures. In 12 of the 14 structures, the Tyr17-H is <2.4 Å from the C10 phosphate group. Tyrosine has been shown to have a high propensity for forming hydrogen bonds in protein­RNA complexes (Jones et al. 2001). No clear sequence-specific base interactions are seen in the peptide­RNA complex. In all 14 of the low energy structures, the amino group of Lys14 penetrates into the major groove and makes close contacts to one or more of the Hoogsteen faces of G16, G17, and G18. The lack of precision in the placement of Lys14 from the NOE data makes it impossible to definitively assign its role in any sequencespecific recognition of the boxB RNA. Collectively, these arginine and lysine side chains, together with the contribution of Tyr17, create a unique positive surface on one side of the N 21 peptide -helix that interacts with the negatively charged RNA phosphodiester backbone and contributes to recognition of boxB RNA. All of the conserved arginines in the N 21 peptide are within electrostatic and hydrogen bonding distances to the boxB RNA. From examination of the structure of the complex, we believe the conserved Arg21 plays a role in specific recognition of boxB RNA. Arginine-21 rests in the curve of the phosphate backbone from C10 to A13 at the top of the boxB loop. The H and H hydrogens are all close enough to the phosphate backbone to provide a framework around which the backbone can organize. All of the other arginines that make contacts to the phosphate backbone do so by simply extending out towards a particular phosphate or pair of phosphates without any other contact with the RNA. The 15 N-HSQC of the peptide in the complex shows that the Arg21-H is shifted downfield in both the 1H and 15N dimensions from all of the other Arg-H resonances, indicative of a unique structural or chemical environment. In addition to its extensive ionic interactions, the aliphatic part of the Arg21 side chain makes van der Waals contacts with the base H5/H6 protons of U11. The ability of arginine to make a variety of polar and nonpolar interactions to accommodate a particular binding surface on an RNA is a common motif (Legault et al. 1998; Weiss and Narayana 1998). van der Waals contacts With 1100 Å2 of buried surface area between the N 21 peptide­boxB RNA complex, polar and nonpolar interactions play an important role in binding.

Internucleotide RNA­RNA restraints are indicated by dashed lines between protons (colored dots). Peptide­RNA restraints (solid arrows) indicate one or more NOEs between the peptide side chains and the RNA ribose (pentagon) or base (rectangle). (B) Superposition of the 14 lowest energy structures of the 21 N peptide­boxB RNA complex, drawn in red and blue, respectively.

For clarity, only the backbone atoms of the peptide are shown.

the peptide side chains make van der Waals contact to the 5 bases and riboses of the boxB RNA (Fig. 7B). The methyl group of Ala13 lies between C7 and C8, packing against both the ribose and base H5/H6 protons of these nucleotides. This alanine is conserved among the family of N proteins, and mutagenesis of this position in the N system showed that only alanine and serine maintained wild-type binding affinity for the boxB RNA (Su et al. 1997). Tyrosine-17 is one turn up the -helix and lies between U9 and C10, the next two bases up the stem from the Ala13 position. In addition to the hydrogen bond interaction of the Tyr17 hydroxyl group, the aromatic ring lies against the edges of the H5/H6 base protons of U9 and C10, and the ribose of U9. Further along the -helix, Arg21 is positioned to make van der Waals contacts with the U11 base H5/H6 protons of the boxB loop, as discussed above. Finally, Ile25 makes extensive van der Waals contacts with the ribose of A12, at the very top of the boxB hairpin (Fig. 7B). Although the interactions of Arg21 with U11 may play a role in supporting the shape of the RNA backbone in the loop, the close contact of Ile25 may support the back side of the boxB

loop on the 3 face. Lysine-18 may also play a role in recognition and stabilization of the boxB loop, through potentially important van der Waals contacts between the Lys18H and H groups and the ribose of A13. DISCUSSION Overview of 21, , and P22 N peptide­boxB structures The NMR solution structures of the N peptide­boxB RNA complexes for phage (Legault et al. 1998; Scharpf et al. 2000) and phage P22 (Cai et al. 1998) have been previously determined. All three peptides bind as -helices. The N peptide has a pronounced bend in the -helix of 120° as a result of deviations of the backbone and angles for Arg11. This bend has been shown to be important for N binding (Tan and Frankel 1995; Su et al. 1997) and antitermination in vivo (Franklin 1993; Su et al. 1997), and is required for bringing Trp18 into position for stacking onto the boxB tetraloop. The NP22 peptide -helix is also bent,

quences of the pentanucleotide loops of (GAAGA) and P22 (GACAA) are similar, and, in fact, both the and P22 boxB loops adopt a fold that is almost identical to a GAAA-type GNRA tetraloop (Cai et al. 1998; Legault et al. 1998). In each case, one of the five nucleotides in the loop is excluded from the tetraloop fold. The boxB loop excludes the fourth nucleotide, G, whereas in P22 it is the third nucleotide, C. In a GNRA tetraloop, the first G and last A form a sheared G-A base pair (type XI; Saenger 1984) resulting in a severe change in direction of the phosphate backbone between the first G and the second nucleotide (N) in the loop. The last three nucleotides in the GNRA sequence stack sequentially on the 3 stem below the loop. The structure of a GAAA tetraloop has been solved by NMR (Heus and Pardi 1991) and X-ray crystallography (Scott et al. 1995; Cate et al. 1996). The r.m.s.d. values of superpositions of the and P22 GAAA tetraloop folds with GAAA tetraloops from crystal structures were 1.4 and 0.8 Å, respectively. The N peptide makes no contacts with the bulged G (fourth nucleotide in the loop). It was shown that mutation of the fourth position had no effect on N binding, and mutations that abolish the "GNRA" sequence motif diminish N binding (Doelling and Franklin 1989; Cilley and Williamson 1997).

though the interaction of this conserved alanine with the boxB stem at this position contributes to N binding, it is more likely a nonspecific than sequence-specific interaction. The first of the three conserved arginines, Arg16 21, makes electrostatic interactions with the phosphate backbone (blue in Fig. 8). Like the conserved alanine, these interactions occur in the same position along the boxB stems. In both the and 21 complexes, the guanidino groups of this arginine make close contact with the phosphate backbone. In the P22 structure, as reported (Cai et al. 1998), this same arginine is not as strongly oriented towards the phosphate backbone. An Arg6  Ala mutation at this position in N reduces FIGURE 7.

FIGURE 8. Two views of the superposition of the boxB stem-peptide recognition regions from all three phage. An amino acid sequence alignment of the three N peptides is at the bottom. In the molecular models, the three boxB RNA hairpins (blue ribbon for the phosphate backbone and purple spheres for the actual phosphate atoms) and the three peptide backbones (shown as colored ribbons) have been superimposed using the phosphate backbone and heavy atoms of the cyan and green colored nucleotides along with the backbone and side chain heavy atoms from the conserved alanine (cyan) and arginines (light blue with violet N spheres). The pairwise r.m.s.d. is 1.41 ± 0.22 angstroms. The coloring of the side chains and bases in the molecular models corresponds to the coloring in the sequence alignment at bottom. The nucleotides on the 3 half of the boxB stem have been removed for greater clarity.

Structural mimicry within the boxB loops Binding interactions between the N peptides and boxB loops diverges sharply from the structural homology evident in the peptide-stem interactions (Fig. 8). The third conserved arginine in all three complexes binds the boxB loop; there is not the same degree of overlap seen for the side-chains-involved stem binding part of the peptide (highlighted in red, orange, and yellow in Fig. 8). The pronounced bend in the N -helix accommodates the stacking of Trp18 on top of the AAA stack of the tetraloop. This interaction is a critical determinant in recognition because neither of the other N peptides has an aromatic residue near this position in its primary sequence, and mutation of this position diminishes binding of the N peptide (Su et al. 1997) and abolishes antitermination in vivo (Franklin 1993). The majority of residues between Arg11 and Lys19 are involved in electrostatic and van der Waals interactions with the GAAA tetraloop formed by boxB . The NP22 peptide interacts with its cognate boxB through extensive van der Waals interactions with a cytidine nucleotide 672

that is excluded from the GAAA tetraloop structure of boxBP22 (Cai et al. 1998). The NP22 has far fewer interactions with the tetraloop structure of its boxB than does N peptide. Despite the differences in peptide­loop interactions, the NP22 and N peptide­boxB complexes have essentially the same GAAA tetraloop structure, with the bases of the stacked adenosines on the opposite face from the N peptides. The structure determined in this work shows that the boxB 21 loop, in complex with the N 21 peptide, does have structural homology with the GNRA-type tetraloops of boxB and boxBP22. The GNRA-like fold is mimicked in boxB 21 by formation of a U-turn and stacking of the last four nucleotides in the loop (AACC) onto the 3 stem, similar to the AAA stacking in tetraloops of and P22. The degree of structural similarity is evident in a superposition of the stacked AACC of boxB 21 and the stacked Trp18:AAA of boxB (Fig. 9). It is striking that the Trp18 amino acid occupies a similar position to the A12 21 nucleotide in the boxB 21 complex and has a similar structural geometry. The face of the two loops that would be presented to NusA or other bacterial host factors are very similar in both the geometry and the constellation of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the N­boxB complex interacts with some other factor or factors in the antitermination complex. This degree of structural similarity is a surprising coincidence given the disparate RNA loop sequences and the very different ways in which they bind to their cognate N proteins, as discussed above. Despite having very different sets of interactions with their boxB loops, these three peptides ultimately organize the 3 -half of their boxB hairpins to be structurally and chemically similar. The three peptide­RNA structures help explain the binding specificity and affinity of the N peptide­boxB RNAs (Table 1). The and P22 boxB RNAs contain the requisite sequences for forming a GNRA tetraloop, each flipping out one base in the process. The bulged C (third nucleotide) in the boxBP22 may have steric clashes with the N peptide stacking of the critical Trp18 onto the tetraloop, a critical binding interaction. In contrast, the boxB could substitute for the boxBP22 by flipping out the third nucleotide (A instead of C) in the context of the extensive hydrophobic packing of the NP22 peptide. Two factors could contribute to the weak binding of N peptide to boxB 21 RNA. First, the top of the stacked nucleotides in boxB 21 is further away from the stem and thus not as accessible for Trp18 stacking. Second, A12 in boxB 21 occupies the position where Trp18 would stack, resulting in steric clash. N­boxB in a biological context The boxB hairpin does more than simply anchor N protein to the RNA transcript and help deliver the N protein to RNA polymerase. Although the mechanism of N-mediated

In the boxB­N structure, this nucleotide is extruded out of the tetraloop and has no apparent interactions with either the boxB RNA or the N peptide. Presumably this bulged nucleotide is available for interactions with NusA or other factors. Neither the 21 nor the P22 boxBs have a purine base bulged out of the side of the loop. How is this seemingly critical determinant of the N ­boxB ­NusA interaction provided for in the other two FIGURE 9. Two views of the superposition of the and 21 boxB loops.

T7 RNA polymerase (optimized amount) per 50 µL of transcription volume. Transcription reactions were run for 4 h at 37°C, then extracted with phenol to remove the T7 RNA polymerase protein and ethanol precipitated. The crude RNA was purified using denaturing preparative gel electrophoresis, electroeluted using an Elutrap (Schleicher and Schuell), and ethanol precipitated. The purified RNA was extensively dialyzed against ddH2O, and lyophilized. For the most accurate determination of the RNA concentration, a small sample was hydrolyzed in NaOH (pH 12), neutralized with HCl, and the UV absorbance at 260 nm was used to calculate the concentration. Peptide and RNA stocks were stored at -20°C in a lyophilized state until used. Peptide and RNA samples for NMR were resuspended with 500 µL of ddH2O and dialyzed in a microdialysis chamber (BRL) with a 500 MWCO membrane for 12 to 24 h each against 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, then 0.1 mM EDTA, and finally two changes of ddH2O. Samples were lyophilized and then resuspended in N 21 NMR buffer: 25 mM D6(98%)-succinate (pH 6.0; Cambridge Isotopes), 2 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.05 mM Na-azide, 10% D2O. NMR sample volumes were 600 µL. Samples were exchanged into D2O as needed by lyophilization and resuspension in 99.9% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes). This was repeated three times, and after the third lyophilization, the sample was resuspended in "100%" D2O to 600 mL and transferred to an NMR sample tube.

The 100 lowest energy docked structures were minimized by two rounds of low-temperature annealing using Sander, a module of AMBER (Pearlman et al. 1995). As with the docking, the temperature was kept low (1000 K). Our experience has been that structural minimization using AMBER yields better and more consistent results for nucleic acid, and protein­nucleic acid complexes than Xplor or Discover. We also wanted to take advantage of the recent improvements in the Generalized Born model for solvation that is incorporated into AMBER. Structure refinement using implicit solvent is computationally expensive, but results in both faster convergence and higher quality structures than in vacuo calculations (Bashford and Case 2000). The 14 lowest energy structures were used for generating an average structure, which was energy minimized using a conjugate gradient. The structural statistics for the ensemble and the minimized, average structure indicate that, at least within the core peptide-RNA-binding region, the solution structure converges well (Table 3, Panel B). The atomic coordinates for the ensemble of low energy structures, as well as that for the minimized, average structure have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, and assigned PDB ID code 1NYB.

NMR assignments
A number of heteronuclear NMR experiments were run to determine peptide and RNA 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments, as well as generate restraints for molecular modeling (Table 2). These included NOE distance restraints, torsion angle restraints, sugar pucker and glycosidic bond angle restraints, RNA base pairing, and peptide backbone hydrogen bond restraints (Table 3, Panel A).

Molecular modeling
The molecular modeling of the N 21 peptide­boxB RNA complex was done in three steps. First, a complete intramolecular restraint set was generated for each molecule, and then peptide and RNA structures were generated separately using ab initio simulated annealing (SA) starting from a random extended structure in CNSsolve (Brunger et al. 1998). For both the peptide and the RNA, constrained (torsion) dynamics was used at 50,000 K. Though this approach is more computer intensive than restrained (Cartesian) dynamics, it demonstrates a better rate of convergence of the calculated structures (Rice and Brunger 1994). A total of 100 structures each of the peptide and RNA were generated. In the second step, each of the 20 lowest energy peptide and 20 lowest energy RNA structures were combined in single PDB files, in all 400 possible combinations. The RNA was held at the origin and the peptide was randomly rotated and moved 100 Å away in a random direction from the origin. These 400 possible "complexes" were docked using CNSsolve. The objective of the docking was to bring the peptide and RNA together without dramatically perturbing their folded structures from the first round of SA, so the temperatures for the docking were set much lower than in the initial calculations (1000 versus 50,000 K).
