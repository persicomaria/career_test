Adenine reacts selectively with di-tert-butyldicarbonate in THF in the presence of NaOH to give N9-monoBoc-adenine 1. The molecular structure and crystal packing of this and four other variably substituted Boc-derivatives of adenine were determined in solid state by means of X-ray diffraction and CP/MAS NMR experiments and characterized in liquid state by 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR spectroscopy as well. Additionally, crystal structure of inclusion compound between N6-monoBoc-adenine 5 and CHCl3 is reported. Tautomeric equilibria of mono- and disubstituted derivatives 4 and 5 in liquid state were studied by VT NMR experiments. Ó 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Purines are of great importance being components of diverse group of biologically significant molecules, including nucleic acids and a wide variety of cofactors and signaling molecules whose interaction with enzymes and proteins are essential for the function of the cell. Recently, naturally occurring purines have been reviewed by Rosemeyer [1]. Legraverend and Grierson for their part have discussed the wide range of biological activities displayed by purines, and highlighted the new purine-based agents which find potential application as chemical-biology tools and/or therapeutic agents [2]. Modified purine derivatives are broadly studied because of their biological and pharmacological activity [3,4]. One important feature of purines and their derivatives is their tautomerism [5­7]. Substitution of the purine ring usually influences the relative populations of the individual tautomers. Solvent and the temperature have also their effect to the equilibrium [8,9]. The knowledge about the tautomeric equilibria is important in prediction of N-alkylation, acylation and glycosylation positions, hydrogen-bonding patterns, as well as interactions with biological targets [10]. Intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions and p­p stacking are crucial in defining the solid state structure of purine derivatives. Adenine and its derivatives contain many hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites and their existence in different tautomeric forms results in great variety of hydrogen-

bonding patterns in the crystals of these compounds. These interactions play significant role in the action of these molecules and thus the hydrogen bonding interactions and base stacking both in solution and in solid state is worth studying. In solution, adenine and its derivatives exist mainly in N(9)­H (major) and N(7)­H (minor) tautomeric form. The N(3)­H tautomeric form has also been found to be present in the DMSO-solution of adenine and 8-bromoadenine [11]. On the NMR time scale tautomeric proton exchange is usually fast and one thus observes only the weighted average of the contributing tautomeric forms. In their   studies with 6-substituted purines Seckárová et al. [8] have shown that slowing down this exchange by cooling the NMR sample, enables the examination of the tautomeric equilibrium of purine derivatives in solution. Recently they also tested this method for biogenic purine bases and studied the effect of the substitution and the solvent effect on the tautomeric population [9]. Low-temperature NMR has thus been shown to offer an efficient tool in prediction of the tautomeric equilibria of purines in solution. In the present study, we investigated variably substituted tertbutoxycarbonyl (Boc)-adenines (Scheme 1) in solid state by X-ray crystallography and CP/MAS NMR and in liquid state by NMR spectroscopy and ESI-TOF mass spectrometry. We prepared N6,N6,N9tris-Boc-adenine (2) and sequentially hydrolysed it to get N6,N6bis-Boc-adenine (4) and N6-mono-Boc-adenine (5) as described in the literature [12]. Synthesis of tris-Boc-adenine (2) yielded also, as a side product, N6,N6,N7-tris-Boc-adenine (3), regiomer of the previous, which was separated by crystallization from the mixture of isomers. In the literature, a selective method for preparation of N6-mono-Boc-adenine (5) is described and includes using NaH as

2. Experimental 2.1. Synthesis and analytical data for new compounds Compounds 4 and 5 were prepared by partial hydrolysis of trisBoc-adenine (mixture of 2 and 3) as described in the literature [12] (see Scheme 2). 2.2. N9-mono-Boc-adenine 1 In a round-bottom 2-necked 250 mL flask 1.0 g (7.4 mmol) of adenine was suspended with 70 mL of THF and 8.2 mL of 1 M NaOH was added. Resulting solution was stirred for 15 min after which 1.62 g (7.4 mmol) of di-tert-butyldicarbonate, (Boc)2O, dissolved in 10 mL of THF, was added at once and stirring continued at rt for 16 h. Reaction mixture was then concentrated and diluted with water. Aqueous mixture was acidified with NaHSO3 (aq.) until almost all of the precipitate was dissolved (to pH $4). Aqueous solution was extracted with 4 Â 50 mL of EtOAc and the organic layer dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness in vacuo to give 1.0 g (57%) of 1 as white solid. 1H NMR in CDCl3, ppm: 8.51 (C2-H, s, 1H), 8.25 (C8-H, s, 1H), 5.71 (N6-H2, br. s, 2H), 1.69 (C(CH3)3, s, 9H). 13C NMR in CDCl3, ppm: 155.7 (C6), 155.1 (C2), 149.9 (C4), 146.1 (C10), 139.5 (C8), 120.2 (C5), 86.7 (C12), 28.0 (C13-C15). ESI-TOF MS (MeOH): C10H13N5O2. Found m/z: [M + Na]+ 258.06 ([C10H13N5O2 + Na]+ requires 258.10), [2M + Na] 493.14 ([2Â C10H13N5O2 + Na]+ requires 493.20). 2.3. N6,N6,N9-tris-Boc-adenine 2 and N6,N6,N7-tris-Boc-adenine 3 Synthesis was carried out following the procedure described in the literature [12]. Crude product was gained as yellow oil which dissolved in small amount of EtOAc and to the resulting solution hexane was added until the solution got dim. Solution was then placed in a fridge o/n upon which time the crystallization of product occurred. Crystals were separated and washed with hexane.

a base [13]. We found out that adenine reacts selectively with ditert-butyldicarbonate in THF in the presence of NaOH to give N9monoBoc-adenine (1). To our knowledge neither N9-monoBocadenine (1) nor N6,N6,N7-tris-Boc-adenine (3) have been described in the literature before. Compounds 1­5 were crystallized for single crystal X-ray analyses. Furthermore, N6-monoBoc-adenine (5) formed inclusion crystals (6) with chloroform. Molecular structures of 1­6 based on crystal data are presented and compared to those existing in the literature for other adenine derivatives. Hydrogen bonding in these crystals is also discussed. All of the prepared compounds were extensively characterized and their 1H, 13C and 15N NMR chemical shifts with their assignment in CDCl3 and partly in DMSO-D6 are presented here. The NMR data from the derivatives, which structures have been verified by crystal structure is useful for synthetic chemists, who often encounter the problem of confirming the regioselectivity in alkylation and acylation of adenine. Although there exists some 1H and 13C NMR data for compounds 2, 4 and 5 in the literature [12­14], no comprehensive NMR chemical shift assignment has been made for them before.

culated from integrals in 1H NMR spectrum). From the mixture of the isomers, compounds 2 and 3 were separated by crystallization. Single crystals of compound 3 were grown in dilute EtOAc­hexane (1:9) at 6 °C. Crystallization of compound 2 took place by slow evaporation of residual mother liquor at ambient temperature. Analysis of colourless crystals of 3: 1H NMR in CDCl3, ppm: 9.08 (C2-H, s, 1H), 8.74 (C8-H, s, 1H), 1.39 (C12-(CH3)3), C18-(CH3)3, s, 18H), 1.65 (C24(CH3)3, s, 9H). 13C NMR in CDCl3, ppm: 164.4 (C4), 154.2 (C8), 150.1 (C10, C16), 148.1 (C2), 146.0 (C22), 145.5 (C6), 119.5 (C5), 88.0 (C24) 83.7 (C12, C18), 27.9 (C13-C15, C19-C21), 27.8 (C25-C27). ESI-TOF MS (MeOH): C20H58N5O6. Found m/z: [M + Na]+ 458.22 ([C20H58N5O6 + Na]+ requires 458.20), [2M + Na] 893.50 ([2Â C20H58N5O6 + Na]+ requires 893.41). 2.4. NMR spectroscopy
1 H, 13C and 15N NMR experiments were run with a Bruker Avance DRX 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm diameter broad band inverse probehead working at 500.13 MHz for 1H, at 125.76 MHz for, and at 50.69 MHz for 15N, respectively. The {1H}­13C NMR spectrum was measured in standard way using walz16 decoupling. The nitrogen chemical shifts were measured by PFG 1H,15N HMBC using 50 ms evolution delay for couplings. 1 H spectra of 4 were collected at temperatures varying from 213 to 303 K. In order to observe different tautomers 4a and 4b 13C and heteronuclear correlation spectra were also collected at 233 K. All of the liquid state NMR spectra were measured in CDCl3 and DMSO-D6 and 1H and 13C chemical shifts referenced to the solvent signals (d = 7.26 ppm for 1H and d = 77.00 ppm for 13C from int. TMS in CDCl3 and d = 2.50 ppm for 1H in DMSO-D6 from int. TMS, respectively). The 15N NMR spectra were referenced to an external nitromethane in a capillary inserted coaxially inside the NMR-tube (d = 0.0 ppm). The assignment of the individual 1H, 13C and 15N signals was carried out utilizing the 2 D std. experiments PFG 1H,13C HMQC [15,16] and PFG 1H,13C HMBC [16] and PFG 1H,15N HMBC [17] and by referring them with those reported in the literature for similar type of compounds [18­20]. 13C and 15N CP/MAS measurements were performed at room temperature with Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer, equipped with a 4 mm standard bore CP/MAS probehead, using 4 mm zirconia rotors. The samples were spun at 10 KHz. The CP contact time was 2 ms for 13C and 3 ms for 15N with relaxation delay of 5 s. For chemical shift calibration the spectrum of glycine sample, with known chemical shifts (173.3 ppm and 42.6 ppm for 13C and À371.5 ppm for 15N), was measured prior to sample. Assignment of the individual 13C chemical shifts was carried out utilizing the CPPI pulse sequence [21­ 23] using relaxation delay of 2 s.

Data were collected at 173(2) K (compounds 1 and 4) and at 123(2) K (compounds 2, 3 and 5) on a Bruker­Nonius KappaCCD diffractometer with APEXII detector and graphite monochromated Mo-Ka radiation. COLLECT [24] data collection software was utilized and data was processed with DENZO-SMN [25]. The reflections were corrected for Lorenz polarization effects. The data for compound 6 was corrected for absorption effects (MULABS [26]). The structures were solved by direct methods (SIR2002 [27] or SHELXS-97 [28]) and refined anisotropically by full matrix least squares on F values (SHELXL-97 [28]). Hydrogen atoms were located from the electron density map or from the expected geometry and were refined only isotropically. Figures were drawn with Ortep-3 for Windows [29] and Mercury [30].

ported that when an equimolar amount of di-tert-butyldicarbonate, (Boc)2O, to adenine was used in the presence of 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) a mixture of differently substituted adenines was formed. We found out that stirring equimolar amounts of (Boc)2O and adenine at room temperature in presence of NaOH in THF provides a simple and selective method for preparation N9-mono-Boc-adenine (1) with 59% yield. All of the prepared Boc-adenines were crystallized for the single crystal X-ray analysis. Crystal data and parameters are given in the Tables 1 and 2. The most important results of X-ray structure analysis of compounds 1­6 are summarized in the Tables 3­7. For the conformational comparison of structures 1­6 in crystalline state, the most interesting are the values of rotation of Boc-group/groups from the plane of the base, best described by the values of the torsion angle C(5)­C(6)­N(6)­C(10), varying between 79.2° and 135.8° for compounds having two Boc-groups in the exocyclic nitrogen. Fig. 1 shows the molecular structure of N9-mono-Boc-adenine (1). Compound 1 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21/c. The N(9)-acyl group is nearly coplanar with the base in crystalline state and its keto oxygen is trans to C(8)­H. Srikrishnan et al. [31,32] have reported the structure of benzyl 6-aminopurine-9carboxylate where the orientation of C@O is cis to C(8)­H. The hydrogen bonding network for 1 is illustrated in the Fig. 2. The hydrogen-bond geometries in crystals of 1 and 4­6 are listed in the Table 3.

hydrogen bonds using the Watson­Crick sites [33] N(1) and N(6), hydrogen bonding motif [34] being R2 ð8Þ. These dimers are further 2 organized in hydrogen bonding network via N(6)­HB. . .N(3) type hydrogen bond. Activation of the heterocyclic C(2)­H and C(8)­H groups of adenine by neighboring N atoms makes it possible for these groups to donate hydrogen bonds to O atom acceptors [35]. In the case of molecule 1 the C(2)­H is in close contact (2.563 Å, 153.65°) with keto O(10) atom of the acyl group of another molecule probably resulting in weak hydrogen bonding interaction between them. Compound 2 crystallizes in triclinic space group P-1 with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Fig. 3 shows the molecular structure of molecule A of 2. The molecules differ by the rotation of the Boc-groups from the plane of the base indicated by the torsion C(5)­C(6)­N(6)­C(10), which is 135.8° in the mole-

cule A and 115.9° in the molecules B. The N(9)-acyl group is nearly coplanar with the base in crystalline state, but in contrary to compound 1 its keto oxygen is cis to C(8)­H. Fig. 4 shows the molecular structure of 3. Compound 3 crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pccn. In 3 the Boc-groups at N(6) are almost in perpendicular orientation to the plane of the base. The N(7)-acyl group is slightly twisted away from the plane of the base and its keto oxygen is trans to C(8)­H. The orientation of the acyl group is thus similar to the acyl-group in benzyl 6-aminopurine-7-carboxylate [36]. The keto oxygen O(10) from one molecule is in such a close contact (3.2 Å, 152°) to the dipole of C(8)­H of another molecule that there may be a weak hydrogen bonding interaction between them. Fig. 5 shows the molecular structure of 4. Compound 4 crystallizes in monoclinic space group P21/n. In its crystalline state, 4 exists as N(9)­H tautomeric form. N(9)­H appeared in the difference map at a height of 0.6 e ÅÀ3. The observation that C(8)­N(9)­C(4) is

3.5° larger than C(8)­N(7)­C(5) and C(8)­N(9) is 0.049 Å longer than N(7)­C(8) is in agreement with the N(9)­H tautomeric form. The presence of the N(9)­tautomeric form is further confirmed by the hydrogen bonding scheme. This tautomeric form is stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bond. The hydrogen bonding network of 4 is illustrated in Fig. 6. The hydrogen-bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 3. In the crystalline state, two molecules of compound 4 in parallel orientation to each other are connected by a pair of N(9)­H. . .N(3) hydrogen bonds resulting in a graph-set motif R2 ð8Þ. In addition, the keto 2 oxygen O(10) from the first Boc-group of one molecule is in such a close contact (3.151(2) Å, 156.4°) to the dipole of C(8)­H in an-

other molecule of second dimer that there may be a weak hydrogen bonding interaction between them. Fig. 7 shows the molecular structure of 5. Compound 5 crystallizes in triclinic space group P-1 with two independent molecules in asymmetric unit. In its crystal state, compound 5 is a N(7)­H tautomer. N(7)­H appeared in the difference map at a height of 0.8 e ÅÀ3. The observation that C(8)­N(7)­C(5) is 2.9/2.3° larger than C(8)­N(9)­C(4) and N(7)­C(8) is 0.031/0.037 Å longer than C(8)­N(9) is in agreement with the N(7)­H tautomeric form. The presence of the N(7)­tautomeric form is further proved by the hydrogen bonding scheme. This tautomer is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bond between the keto oxygen O(10) of the acyl group and N(7)­H on the Hoogsteen face of the purine generating a graph-set motif S(7). Similar intramolecular hydrogen bond stabilized N(7)­H tautomeric form has been reported for N6-benzoyladenine [37]. Crystals of 5 contain two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit with slightly differing conformations; the Boc-group is differently twisted away from the plane of the base. This results also in difference (0.16 Å, 7.6°) in the length and orientation of hydrogen bond between N(7/70 )­H and O(10/100 ), being 2.773 Å and 121° for molecule A and 2.614 Å and 133° for molecule B. This indicates the strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond to be stronger in the molecule B. The hydrogen bonding network of 5 is illustrated in Fig. 8. The hydrogen-bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 3. Again, Watson­Crick hydrogen bonding sites are taken in use when two molecules of A in parallel orientation are connected by a pair of N(6)­HA. . .N(1) hydrogen bonds constructing a graph-set motif R2 ð8Þ. Also two molecules of B are connected using the same 2 hydrogen bonding geometries with slightly shorter distance and smaller angle between the donor and acceptor. Further, molecule A donates a hydrogen bond to molecule B via N(7)­H. . .N(90 ) hydrogen bond. Crystallization of 5 from CHCl3 resulted in formation of 1:1 inclusion crystals in monoclinic space group C2/c. Inclusion of CHCl3 molecules to the crystal lattice of 5 to form the clathrate 6 does not significantly influence the hydrogen bonding geometries and thus the N(7)­H tautomer is still preferred. Comparison of molecular structure parameters of 5 and 6 reveals that bond lengths and angles of molecule 6 are approximately the same as those of the molecule A in the asymmetric unit of crystals of 5. The hydrogen bonding network of 6 is illustrated in the Fig. 9 and hydrogen-bond lengths and angles are listed in the Table 3. Hydrogen bonding takes place between two parallel molecules at Watson­Crick sites by N(6)­HA. . .N(1) hydrogen bond generating a graph-set motif R2 ð8Þ. As in the case of crystal lattice of pure 5, 2 dimers are further linked by N(7)­H. . .N(9) hydrogen bond. Besides of the hydrogen bonding interactions, the crystal structure of 1, 2 and 5 are also determined by interactions between heterocyclic p-systems. In the case of 3, 4 and 6 bases are in their crystals arranged so far from each other, that no obvious base stacking is apparent. 1 H, 13C and 15N NMR chemical shifts of 1­5 in CDCl3 and partly in DMSO-D6 are listed in the Tables 8­10. Chemical shifts for 4 in solid state were obtained by 13C and 15N CP/MAS experiments and are listed in the Table 11. Assignment of 1H and 13C chemical shifts for compound 2 as well as assignment of 1H and partial assignment of 13C shifts of 4 have been given in the literature [14]. Their assignments were in agreement with that done during this research. There are at least two articles discussing the chemical shifts of adenines bearing carbonyl substituents, but the chemical shifts there are recorded in DMSO-D6 [18,20]. Because the 1H chemical shifts of C(2)­H and C(8)­H are strongly dependent on the solvent in question, we recorded NMR spectra of 1, 4 and 5 also in DMSO-D6 to get comparable data. In the case of 2 and 3 the sam-

ples in DMSO-D6 were degraded fast and thus no 2D spectra could be recorded for them preventing the reliable assignment of their chemical shifts in DMSO-D6. In each case 1, 4 and 5 the proton C(2)­H was more shielded (0.15­0.27 ppm) in DMSO-D6 than in CDCl3 whereas the proton C(8)­H was more deshielded (0.11­ 0.21 ppm) in DMSO-D6 than in CDCl3, respectively. Only in the case

of compound 1 all of the 13C chemical shifts were clearly visible in DMSO-D6. In other cases, some of the peaks were very broad if visible at all. Tautomeric equilibria of 4 and 5 were studied by measuring their 1H NMR spectra in variable temperatures. Fig. 10 shows the temperature dependence 1H NMR spectrum of 4 in CDCl3 between

213 and 303 K. At 303 K only one set of signals for C(2)­H and C(8)­H was detected. Signals from N(7)­H and N(9)­H are visible also at 303 K, but they are very broad and overlapping. Lowering temperature results in significant broadening of the proton signals and change in both C(2)­H and C(8)­H signals. At 213 K two sets of sharp signals are visible with the relative integrals of 1.00/0.66, corresponding to 60% of major (N(9)­H tautomeric form) and 40% of minor (N(7)­H tautomeric form), respectively. Owing to the broadness of 1H spectral lines at 303 K, chemical shift correlations could be detected neither between 1H and 13C nor 1H and 15N nuclei in HMQC and HMBC experiments. When the correlation experiments were run at 233 K, the resolved chemical shifts from different tautomers 4a and 4b were observed. The 1H, 13C and 15 N shifts were assigned to individual tautomers based on heteronuclear correlation spectra. To ensure that 4 exists entirely as N(9)­H tautomeric form (4a) in solid, we carried out 13C and 15N CP/MAS experiments (see Table 11). Chemical shifts from the 13C experiment are in good agreement with the chemical shifts at 213 K in liquid state of compound 4a, proving the homogeneity of tautomeric form in solid. In the liquid state the 15N chemical shift of N(6) could not be detected. However, in the solid state the 15N chemical shifts can be detected directly (without the transfer of magnetization from the proton), so the chemical shift for N(6) is observed. The difference of the chemical shift in liquid and in solid state for nitrogens N(1) and N(7) is around 15 ppm, but for N(9) and N(3) it is 25 ppm and 34 ppm, respectively. Reason for the shielding-effect on N(3) may be explained by the increase of electron density around that nucleus due to hydrogen bonding. It is however difficult to compare and explain differences in chemical shifts between liquid and solid state, because of the influence of the solvatation in liquid state and crystal packing and weak interactions in the solid state, respectively.

Fig. 10. Temperature dependence of 1H NMR spectrum of 4 in CDCl3 between 213 K and 303 K.

Compound 5 showed only one set of signals when measured at CDCl3 in variable temperatures. Its signals remain sharp when going down to 213 K. Chemical shifts of C(5) (112.2 ppm) and N(7/9)­H (11.54 ppm) and the difference of the chemical shift of C(2)­H and C(8)­H (0.49 ppm) are in good agreement with the N(7)H tautomeric form 4b. It is thus expected that 5 exists solely as N(7)­H tautomeric form also in the solution and that the intramolecular hydrogen bond found in the crystal of 5 probably defines the its structure also in the solution state. 4. Conclusions We have reported single crystal X-ray structures of five Bocprotected adenines 1­5 and that of 5ÅCHCl3 clathrate (6). Variable temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy has been used to characterize the tautomeric equilibrium of 4. In crystalline state 4 exists entirely as N(9)­H tautomer (4a) which has been ascertained by Xray and 13C CP/MAS studies. In our opinion, these results are useful
