INTRODUCTION To protect the cell from exogenous DNA, most species have DNA modification methylase.1,2 It is also reported that DNA methylation is essentially involved in bacterial virulence. Many restriction­modification (R­M) systems have been researched, and several three-dimensional structures of R­M enzymes have been determined.3­5 DNA modification methylases (MTases) catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to DNA from S-adenosyl-Lmethionine (AdoMet), which is consequently converted to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy). These enzymes are categorized into the following two classes based on the position of the transferred methyl group on the DNA bases: endocyclic MTases and exocyclic amino MTases. Endocyclic MTases methylate the C5 position of a cytosine base, whereas exocyclic amino MTases methylate the N6 position of an adenine base or N4 position of a cytosine base.5­7 Furthermore, the exocyclic amino MTases are subdivided into six classes, namely, a, b, g, f, d, and e, based on their amino acid sequences.8 We selected Thermus thermophilus HB8 for systematic study of the structures and functions of all proteins from a single organism in a project called the Whole-Cell Project.9,10 T. thermophilus HB8 is a gram-negative bacterium that grows at temperatures above 758C.11 Sequence analysis predicted five DNA MTases in the T. thermophilus genome. TTHA1583 is an adenine-specific DNA modification MTase (M.TthHB8I) involved in the R­M system.12 The gene TTHA1584 directly downstream of TTHA1583 encodes a type II restriction endonuclease

(R.TthHB8I). The physiological functions of other MTases are still unclear, because we cannot annotate their accompanying restriction endonucleases. TTHA0928 is said to be a hypothetical MTase although its structure has recently been determined.13 TTHA1016 is predicted to be an adenine-specific DNA MTase. TTHA0409 was annotated as a putative modification MTase. This protein and TTHB185 are predicted to be N6-adenine- or N4-cytosine-specific DNA MTases, which are b-class exocyclic amino MTases. It should be noted that TTHB185 exhibits a much lower sequence similar to MTase class than TTHA0409. It is possible that TTHA0409 is another modification MTase in the R­M system, because many organisms contain multiple R­M systems. However, we cannot identify the accompanying restriction endonuclease in the T. thermophilus genome. Such ``orphan'' MTases are also found in other bacteria,14 but have scarcely been characterized. To confirm that this enzyme is actually a DNA modification methylase, we determined its three-dimensional ° structure in the free state at 2.1 A and in the AdoMet° . The overall structure of the enzyme bound state at 2.4 A was determined to be similar to those of b-class exocyclic N4 MTases. This is the first report that shows the

structure of a heat-stable b-class exocyclic amino MTase. Interestingly, TTHA0409 as well as M.MboIIA and M.RsrI are crystallized as dimers. This structure shed light on the dimeric interface of dimeric DNA MTases.

METHODS
Protein overexpression and purification

Sequence data for the ttha0409 gene was obtained from the T. thermophilus HB8 genome project (DDBJ/ EMBL/GeneBank AP008226). This information was used for the synthesis of forward and reverse primers for amplification of ttha0409 genes by BEX (Tokyo, Japan), and PCR was carried out with these primers and LA Taq polymerase (TakaraBio). The amplified fragment was ligated into the pT7Blue plasmid (Novagen) by TA cloning. Sequence analysis revealed that the construction was error free. The gene fragment was then digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the compatible sites of pET-11a (Novagen). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and B834(DE3) cells (Novagen) transformed with the resultant pET-11a/ttha0409 plasmid were grown at 378C for 20 h in 1.5 L of LB and LeMaster medium containing selenomethyonine (SeMet) containing 50 lg/mL ampicillin, respectively, and expression of native TTHA0409 and the SeMet derivative was induced by isopropyl-b-D-thiogalacto-pyranoside. The cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl (pH 8.0), and the lysate was then incubated at 708C for 10 min. After centrifugation of the lysate (30,000g) for 20 min at 48C, TTHA0409 in the clear supernatant was purified by successive chromatographic steps with RESOURCE PHE, RESOURECE S, Bio-Scale CHT 10-I, and HiLoad 16­60 Superdex 75-pg columns. Purified proteins were stored in 20 mM Tris­HCl and 150 mM NaCl (pH 8.0).
Crystallization, data collection, and determination

wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data were collected at the RIKEN Structural Genomics Beamline II (BL26B2) at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) using the anomalous scattering from Se atoms. The data sets of free native TTHA0409 and AdoMet-bound TTHA0409 were collected at BL44B2 at SPring-8. The collected data were processed with the HKL2000 program suite.15 The atomic positions of the Se in the unit cell were determined with the program SOLVE,16 and an initial model of the SeMet derivative was built with the program RESOLVE.17 Model completion and adjustments to the structure were accomplished with Xfit in the XtalView software package.18 Initial models of free native TTHA0409 and AdoMetbound TTHA0409 were built by molecular replacement. The model refinement, initial packing, and manual verifying of water molecules were carried out with programs CNS19 and XtalView/Xfit.18 The final model was validated with the program PROCHECK of the CCP4 suite.20 The refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The coordinates are available in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2ZIE, 2ZIF, and 2ZIG.
Isothermal titration calorimetry

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was carried out with a VP-ITC (MicroCal). TTHA0409 and AdoMet were dissolved in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl. We calculated the concentration of AdoMet with a spectrophotometer with e257 5 14,700 (cm21 M21). A 100 lM AdoMet solution (10 ll) was injected 25 times into the ITC cell containing TTHA0409 (3 lM) solution or the buffer (blank) at 258C. The blank data were subtracted from the experimental data of the TTHA0409 solution. We carried out this experiment three times and calculated the average data. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall structure of TTHA0409

Crystallization of the SeMet derivative was performed by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K by mixing 1 lL of a protein solution (9.1 mg/mL) with an equal volume of a reservoir solution comprising 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.6), 38% ethanol, and 25 mM magnesium chloride. Crystallization of free native TTHA0409 (12.8 mg/mL) and the TTHA0409-AdoMet complex (12.8 mg/mL) was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K by mixing 1 lL of a protein solution with an equal volume of a reservoir solution comprising 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.2), 34% ethanol and 25 mM magnesium chloride, and 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.4), 42% ethanol, 25 mM magnesium chloride, and 500 lM AdoMet (SIGMA), respectively. All data sets were collected from the crystals in the mother liquor containing 20% glycerol under a liquid nitrogen stream. Multiple-

The overall structures of the free and AdoMet-bound forms were determined by the MAD method at resolutions ° ° of 2.1 A [Fig. 1(A)] and 2.4 A, respectively. The asymmetric unit contains two TTHA0409 molecules. Each monomer contains six a-helices and a seven-stranded parallel b-sheet except for the seventh antiparallel strand [Fig. 1(B)]. The fold is referred to as an ``AdoMet-dependent MTase fold'' and is shared by all structurally characterized DNA MTases.21,22 In addition, this protein also has a target-recognition domain (TRD), which is commonly found in DNA MTases. The well-shared fold suggests that TTHA0409 is also a DNA modification MTase dependent on AdoMet. The order of secondary structure elements is b1-aA-b2-daB-b3-b4-d-b5-aC-b6-d-b7-TRD-d-aD-b8-aE-b9-aF-b10. ``d'' represents disordered regions: residues 1­20, 54­61 (53­64), 105­108 (103­107), 140­155 (140­155), 210­218

(212­217), and 291­297 in chain A (or B). The aD, b4, and b5 regions are unique to the TTHA0409 structure and thus annotated as additional elements with novel numbering. It should be noted that according to the numbering of secondary structure elements commonly used for known MTases,23 the order is b3-aC-b4-d-aD-b5-bX-dbY-aE-b6-d-b7-TRD-d-aX-b1-aA-b2-aB-b8, in which aX, bX, and bY correspond to the additional elements. Based on the amino acid sequence, TTHA0409 is categorized as a b-class exocyclic amino MTase.8 To date, the three structures of b-class exocyclic amino MTases have been determined, namely, M.PvuII,24 M.RsrI,25,26 and M.MboIIA.27 All these enzymes are from mesophilic bacteria. Therefore, this is the first report that shows the structure of a thermostable b-class exocyclic amino MTase. A circular dichroism spectrum showed that this protein was stable up to 938C (data not shown). The structure of TTHA0409 appears more compact than those of M.PvuII, M.RsrI, and M.MboIIA. The TRD of M.RsrI (and M.MboIIA) protrudes from the core domain [Fig. 1(E)], whereas TTHA0409 has a smaller TRD, which is situated near the core domain [Fig. 1(B)]. M.PvuII has one more helix at the C-terminus compared with TTHA0409. In

addition, TTHA0409 (chain A) has an extra b-sheet composed of two strands b4 (100­103) and b5 (110­113) [Fig. 1(B)], whereas the corresponding region of M.RsrI is unstructured [Fig. 1(E)]. These structural features of TTHA0409 may contribute to its thermostability. Two TTHA0409 chains in the asymmetric unit tightly interact with each other [Figs. 1(C) and 2(A)]. The dimer interface area, defined as the difference between the surface area of the dimer and the sum of the surface areas of the ° respective subunits, is calculated to be 2400 A2. This is ° 2) and M.RsrI larger than those in M.MboIIA (1900 A ° (1500 A2).26,27 The dimer interface includes several hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic bonds, and water-mediated interactions. It is known that an oligomeric state is sometimes important for thermostability.28 More importantly, however, there is a possibility that the dimer is a functional unit of TTHA0409. The apparent molecular weight of the purified TTHA0409 was 82,000 by gel filtration (data not shown), suggesting that TTHA0409 exists in a dimeric form in the absence of DNA. M.MboIIA and M.RsrI also dimerize both in solution and in the crystal lattice.26,27 These data together with the results of sitedirected mutagenesis suggest that a dimer is a functional

unit of M.RsrI and probably other b-class MTases.28 The conserved motif in the dimer interface of these dimeric bclass MTases is also well conserved in TTHA0409, and these residues are actually located at the dimer interface. Therefore, TTHA0409 is also expected to function as a dimer. When compared with the M.MboIIA dimer, TTHA0409 seems to form a more tightly packed dimer [Fig. 1(C)]. This can be partly ascribed to the smaller TRD of TTHA0409 as described earlier. Furthermore, more intersubunit interactions seem to be observed in TTHA0409 than M.MboIIA. In TTHA0409, the b6­b7 loop (residues 139­167) is likely to interact with the

TRD of the other subunit. Similar interaction was observed in the case of M.MboIIA.26 In addition, the b4­loop­b5 region is likely to interact with the aC­b6 loop of the other subunit [Fig. 2(A)]. Several hydrogen bonds were found at this interface. This interaction is unique for TTHA0409, because M.MboIIA has no bsheet corresponding to the small b-sheet comprised of b4 and b5 in TTHA0409 [Fig. 2(B)]. The presence of such an extensive dimer interface strengthens the possibility that TTHA0409 functions as a dimer. Because the notion of ``a functional dimer'' indicates its ability to bind DNA as a dimer, we must identify the DNA-binding site in TTHA0409. In the determined struc-

tures of modification MTases complexed with DNA, the enzymes bind to DNA as monomers.22 Although no structure has been determined for dimeric b-class MTases with DNA, a DNA-binding model was proposed.23,29 Some positively charged regions can be found near the dimeric interface. In the side view of the dimer shown in Figure 1(C), the three regions appear to be positively charged, namely, the region comprised the b4­b5 sheet and b2­aB, the region around aE­b9, and the TRD. The tip of the b4­b5 sheet, which is disordered, also contains positively charged residues (RRH). The b2­aB region includes the putative catalytic region (47SPPY50) (to be discussed later). The b4­b5 sheet comprises the positively charged area together with this catalytic region. Because the b4­b5 sheet is likely to be involved in dimerization as mentioned earlier, it is possible that dimerization is required for the formation of DNA-binding site near the catalytic site. DNA-binding site can be modeled to position DNA at the border of the dimer interface in a similar way to the dimer-binding model proposed for M.RsrI.28
Interaction with substrate

conformational change in TTHA0409. The bound AdoMet is bent like as that bound to M.RsrI.26 ITC analysis revealed that TTHA0409 bound to AdoMet in an uncooperative manner (data not shown). The data of ITC could be fitted to a ``single set of identical sites'' model. The Kd value was 43 lM, which was larger than that of most other MTases containing M.RsrI.23 The heat change (DH) was 22.6 kcal/mol and the entropy change (DS) was 17.1 cal/mol/deg. The binding of AdoMet can stabilize the protein, because Gibbs free energy (DG) has a negative value as calculated from the DH and DS values. These facts suggest that the DNA MTase activity of TTHA0409 does not have an ordered mechanism where DNA binds first. The reaction catalyzed by TTHA0409 probably proceeds by a random mechanism or an ordered mechanism where AdoMet binds first. Although the amino acid sequence of TTHA0409 is more similar to that of M.RsrI than M.PvuII, a DALI search revealed that the three-dimensional structure is more similar to that of M.PvuII (PDB ID; 1BOO, Z-score ° 5 22.1, RMSD 5 2.9 A) than M.RsrI (PDB ID; 1EG2, ° Z-score 5 21.5, RMSD 5 3.1 A). M.PvuII is an N4 cytosine MTase, whereas M.RsrI is an N6 adenine MTase. Both types of MTases have a well-conserved catalytic motif (S, N/D)PP(Y/W/F), termed as motif IV. TTHA0409 also has this motif, that is, Ser47-Pro48Pro49-Tyr50. Most of the b-class N6 adenine MTases have DPPY sequences, whereas most N4 cytosine MTases have SPPY sequences. In the latter, it has been suggested that the N4 atom of the target cytosine has two hydrogen bonds to Ser and Pro, the first two residues of motif IV.23 The arrangement of substrate-recognition residues surrounding motif IV in the TTHA0409 structure is similar to that in M.PvuII. These results strongly suggest that TTHA0409 methylates the N4 atom of cytosine in DNA.
Physiological function of methylase

The structure of the TTHA0409­AdoMet complex revealed the cavity for binding of AdoMet [Fig. 1(D)]. When compared with the ligand-free structure, it was revealed that the binding of AdoMet induces only a slight

Generally N6 and N4 MTases are associated with R­M systems.14,30 Structural analysis suggests that TTHA0409 is an N4-cytosine-specific DNA MTase. However, TTHA0409 is likely to be an ``orphan'' MTase at present, because no accompanying restriction endonuclease can be identified in T. thermophilus HB8. Such orphan MTases are found in many bacteria,14 but their physiological functions are not clearly known. An orphan C5 cytosine MTase from Vibrio cholerae is suggested to contribute to the generation of spontaneous mutants in a nondividing cell population.14 In contrast to C5-methylated cytosine, however, N4-methylated cytosine is unlikely to stimulate mutation. Interestingly, the genomic DNA of thermophiles grown above 608C contains N4-methylated cytosine, but less C5-methylated cytosine.31,32 N4-methylated cytidine is more resistant against heat-induced deamination than cytidine or C5-methylated cytosine.33 Actually, Thermus aquaticus YT-1, a very close relative of

T. thermophilus HB8, contains N4-methylated cytosine, but not C5-methylated cytosine.31 TTHA0409 may be an orphan MTase, which protects genomic DNA by converting a cytosine to a more heat-stable base. Determination of the recognition sequence of TTHA0409 will promote the study of its physiological role. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Masami Nishida for her help in protein purification.
