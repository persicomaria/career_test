Abstract Multiple molecular forms of inhibitors of trypsin (TI) and chymotrypsin (CI), which are typical digestive enzymes of insects, mammals and micro-organisms, and subtilisin (SI), a proteinase of many bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi, were identified in seeds and vegetative organs of the majority of 128 wild and cultivated species representing 65 genera of three of the subfamilies of the Compositae. Inhibitors with Mr ranging from 7450 to 7800 and combining activities towards subtilisin and trypsin and/or chymotrypsin (T/C/SI) had the widest distribution and may be involved in plant defense mechanisms. They were found in many species of the subfamilies Carduoideae (genera Carthamus, Centaurea, Cirsium), Cichorioideae (Lactuca, Taraxacum) and Asteroideae (Helianthus, Cosmos, Bidens). Partial amino acid sequencing showed that the safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) T/C/SI and Cosmos bipinnatus T/C/SI, T/SI and C/SI belonged to the potato I inhibitor family. The most active, variable and heterogeneous inhibitors were found in species of the tribe Heliantheae, which is placed in the evolutionary advanced subfamily Asteroideae. Seeds of Helianthus species, Eclipta prostrata, Gailardia aristata, Zinnia elegans and Silphium perfoliatum contained various TI with Mr ranging from 1500 to 14,750, with some also containing SI. H. annuus seeds contain a unique cyclic TI of Mr 1514 and similar TI were also present in other Helianthus spp. and the related species Tithonia diversifolia. Zinnia elegans contained a TI with Mr 11,350 which appeared to represent a novel type of inhibitor distantly related to the cereal subgroup of Bowman­Birk inhibitors. TI and T/ SI varied widely in H. annuus lines and wild Helianthus species in their presence or absence and composition. Similar T/SI components were found in the cultivated diploid H. annuus and annual diploid species with the B genome but not in perennials with the A genome. Some T/SI, SI and TI were detected in vegetative organs of sunflower and other Compositae. Studies of the polymorphism and distribution of proteinase inhibitors are relevant to the evolution of protective protein systems and the mechanisms of resistance to pathogenic organisms in the Compositae and other plants. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. Introduction The seeds and vegetative parts of plants contain various proteinaceous inhibitors of insect, fungal, mammalian and endogenous proteinases. These inhibitors may be involved in plant defense mechanisms against harmful organisms and may also play regulatory roles

during plant development (Shewry and Lucas, 1997; Kumar et al., 1999). Furthermore, plant inhibitors are of interest in relation to host/parasite co-evolution (Konarev, 1996), as markers in studies of plant diversity and evolution (Konarev, 1982, 1996; Konarev et al., 1999a, 2002b; Kollipara and Hymowitz, 1992) and as potential drugs with antiviral and other properties. Genes encoding potent and stable inhibitors can also be transferred to other plants to improve their resistance to pests or fungi (Ryan, 1990). Proteinase inhibitors (PI) are well studied, particularly in the families Fabiaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae. Some 12 families of inhibitors

can be recognised based on their amino acid sequences and target proteinases (Shewry, 1999). The Compositae include important oilseeds (sunflower, safflower), vegetables (lettuce, artichoke, topinambour) and medicinal and even rubber plants (kok-saghyz). However, the inhibitors of seeds of the Compositae have not been studied until recently. Levitskii and Pogoreletskaya (1985) showed the presence of components which inhibited non-trypsin type proteinases of the pathogen Botrytis cinerea and inhibited fungal growth while Bhat et al. (1996) demonstrated the presence of inhibitors (presumably of trypsin) which inhibited the development of Helicoverpa armigera larvae. Similarly, the first characterization of a cysteine PI from sunflower seeds was only reported in 1996 (Kouzuma et al., 1996). We have previously isolated several isoforms of serine proteinase inhibitors from species of the Compositae using new approaches combining the identification of proteinase inhibitors after isoelectric focusing with purification by chromatography, including a unique cyclic trypsin inhibitor (TI) of Mr 1514 (Konarev et al., 1999a, 2000a; Luckett et al., 1999), trypsin/subtilisin inhibitors (T/SI) controlled by linked genes in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds (Konarev et al., 1999a, 2000a) and various TI and T/SI in safflower and representatives of other taxa (Konarev et al., 2000b, 2002a). T/SI present in leaves and heads of sunflower were also shown to inhibit subtilisin-like extracellular proteinases of the white rot fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a major pathogen of sunflower, and proteinases of other fungi, indicating a possible protective role (Konarev et al., 1999b). In the present study we aimed to (i) determine the distribution and polymorphism of proteinase inhibitors in cultivated and wild representatives of three main subfamilies of the Compositae: the Carduoideae, Cichorioideae and Asteroideae; (ii) purify and characterize novel inhibitor forms and (iii) determine the evolutionary relationships between inhibitors from various species of the Compositae and other plant taxa. Special attention has been given to inhibitors of trypsin and chymotrypsin which are typical digestive enzymes of insects, mammals and fungi, and subtilisin, a proteinase of phytopathogenic micro-organisms.

results obtained for trypsin and subtilisin inhibitors in selected accessions are summarised in Fig. 1 and Table 1 (results for chymotrypsin inhibitors are not shown). 2.1.1. Subfamily Carduoideae Seeds of 25 acc. of cultivated safflower (C. tinctorius) originating from various parts of the world and wild Carthamus L. species, representing species groups with different chromosome numbers, had a single component of pI about 7.0 which was inhibitory to trypsin, subtilisin (Fig. 1, T and S, tracks 1 and 2) and chymotrypsin (T/C/SI). However, species of Centaurea L., which is taxonomically close to Carthamus, showed variation in inhibitors. Seeds of Centaurea cyanus and C. triumfettii (Fig. 1, tracks 3 and 4) possessed active T/ C/SI components with pI 7.3 and above while C. scabiosa (Fig. 1, track 5) and C. jacea (not shown) had only weak SI with pI of about 5.5. All accessions of C. cyanus had the same T/C/SI band with pI approx 9.0. Leaves of C. cyanus did not contain inhibitors of the serine proteinases studied, in contrast to C. scabiosa leaves (Fig. 1, track 6) which had one T/SI and several SI components. Seeds of Cirsium arvense (Fig. 1, track 7) and C. vulgare (Fig. 1, track 8) differed in their compositions of

Distribution of serine proteinase inhibitors in Compositae The presence of serine proteinase inhibitors was demonstrated by isoelectric focusing followed by visualisation using the ``gelatin replicas'' method. In this method, the presence of inhibitors prevents the digestion of gelatin by various proteinases resulting in dark undigested ``islands'' on a transparent background. The

weak T/SI but no inhibitors were found in the leaves. Seeds of Carduus species had weak TI (Fig. 1, tracks 9 and 10) and T/SI (Fig. 1, track 10). Serratula coronata seeds (Fig. 1, track 11) contained a heterogeneous mixture of proteinase inhibitors but none were detected in seeds of burdock (Arctium), artichoke (Cynara), Cousinia or Saussurea species (Fig. 1, tracks 12­16). 2.1.2. Subfamily Cichorioideae, tribe Lactuceae All accessions of Lactuca (23 var. of L. sativa, L. serriola, L. livida and L. quercina) had the same pattern of inhibitors with T/SI with pI about 7.3 and TI with low pI (about 5.0) as shown in Fig. 1 (tracks 21 and 22). Taraxacum species (Fig. 1, tracks 17­20) differed in their spectra of T/SI and SI, as did accessions of T. officinale (tracks 36­38). Seeds of some accessions of Cichorium intybus (Fig. 1, track 23) and Scorzonera hispanica (Fig. 1, track 24) contained T/SI and SI while species of other genera contained only weak inhibitors or lacked them. 2.1.3. Subfamily Asteroideae Analysis of 46 genera from 8 tribes showed that the least active inhibitors were present in seeds of repre-

sentatives of the tribes Anthemideae, Eupatorieae and Tageteae, with inhibitors not being detected in some such as Chrysanthemum and Tagetes species. The most active, variable and heterogeneous inhibitors were found in seeds of the tribe Heliantheae Cass. with TI, T/ SI, T/C/SI and C/SI being detected (Fig. 1, tracks 32­44 and Table 1). Species of the tribes Asterea (Solidago virgaurea with T/SI and TI, Fig.1, tracks 25 and 26), Senecioneae (Senecio and Emilia spp. with T/SI, Fig. 1, tracks 27­31), Calenduleae (Calendula and Dimorphotheca spp. with T/SI, not shown) and Inuleae (Helichrysum bracteatum, T/SI, not shown) were intermediate in inhibitor activity. Arnica iljinii seeds contained potent T/SI, in contrast to A. alpina (not shown), while Rudbeckia species differed in the presence or absence of very active TI (Fig. 1, tracks 32 and 33) with pI near 5.0. Gaillardia aristata possessed relatively weak T/SI and potent heterogeneous TI while two Dahlia pinnata acc. (Fig. 1, tracks 36 and 37) had similarly heterogeneous and highly active T/C/SI. Bidens species had closely similar spectra of T/C/SI (Fig. 1, tracks 41 and 42). Two Cosmos bipinnatus acc. had similar spectra of inhibitors consisting of T/C/SI and C/SI (Fig. 1,

tracks 38 and 39) and inhibitors of the same type but with different pI were detected in C. caudatus (not shown). Zinnia elegans (Fig. 1, track 40) and Silphium perfoliatum (not shown) had potent TI. Helianthus annuus and Tithonia diversifolia had similar highly alkaline TI components (Fig. 1, tracks 43 and 44) but different T/SI. The T/SI of T. diversifolia are not visible in Fig. 1 due to the low sensitivity of the conditions used for detection. We failed to find inhibitors in the other representatives of subtribe Helianthinae listed in Table 1. 2.1.4. Genus Helianthus L. Analysis of seeds of many varieties and lines of cultivated annual sunflower (H. annuus) revealed seven main band positions (Fig. 2, bands a­f and h) when gelatin replicas were developed by trypsin (T) and five when subtilisin was used (Fig. 2, bands c­f and h). Bands a­f and h were active against both proteinases (i.e. were T/ SI) while a and b were TI (with band b being a doublet). Since the inhibitor components corresponding to band a were much more active than others they were analyzed separately. Band a corresponded to the major cyclic TI with Mr 1,514 (SFTI-1) described previously (Konarev et al., 1999a, 2000a; Luckett et al., 1999) and was present in H. annuus, other diploid annual species including H. petiolaris, H. debilis, H. nuttallii. and H. praecox, in all the tetraploid and hexaploid Helianthus species including topinambour (H. tuberosus) and in all three acc. of Tithonia diversifolia (not shown). Some H. annuus lines (VIR-369 and VIR-848b) and single seeds

of one of two H. hirsutus accessions lacked band a which was also absent from H. annuus leaves and heads and from H. tuberosus L. leaves and tubers. TLGF under non-denaturating conditions showed that the native TI present in sunflower seeds and SFTI-1 purified by affinity chromatography and RP­HPLC (Fig. 3, tracks 11 and 14) had similar masses indicating the absence of significant modification of the protein during purification. It also confirmed the presence of similar low Mr inhibitors in the majority of other Helianthus species including H. tuberosus (Fig. 3, track 12) and in T. diversifolia (Fig. 3, track 13) but not in any other species of the Compositae. T/SI are highly variable in H. annuus lines, in wild annual forms and in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid species (Fig. 2, bands c­h). The nomenclature for bands used here differs from that used in previously published studies (Konarev et al., 2000a) because of improved resolution. Wild forms of H. annuus (Fig. 2, tracks 6­9) contained the majority of bands present in cultivated H. annuus while accessions of wild diploid perennial species (e.g. Fig. 2, tracks 10­12) differed from the annual species in the absence of bands c to f. The majority of tetraploid species also lacked these bands with only one H. hirsutus acc. having band d (Fig. 2, track 14) and H. strumosus having a band at position g not present in H. annuus (Fig. 2, track 17). In hexaploid species, bands c and f were present in accession of H. resinosus (Fig. 1, track 22) and bands e and f in H. multiflorus (Fig. 1, track 23) while H.

tuberosus had a weak band e (Fig. 1, track 39). All studied accessions of hexaploid species had band h. TLGF revealed that the major forms of T/SI found in seeds of representatives of the three subfamilies had similar masses (Fig. 3). The native T/SI from Centaurea, Carthamus, Lactuca, Taraxacum, Cosmos and Bidens species and purified H. annuus T/SI (a fraction containing a mixture of IEF bands d and e in Fig. 2; Fig. 3, T, track 15 and S, track 1) had mobilities on TLGF between aprotinin (Mr 6,500) and cytochrome c (Mr 14,400) (the activity of the native sunflower T/SI was not sufficiently high for detection after TLGF). TI from different sources had Mr ranging from the lowest (SFTI1) in H. annuus, H. tuberosus and T. diversifolia (Fig. 3, T, tracks 11­13), which migrated between bromophenol blue (Mr 692) and aprotinin (Mr 6,500) to the highest in Gailardia aristata (Fig. 3, track 5) and Eclipta prostrata (Fig. 3, track 7) with TI from Silphium perfoliatum, Zinnia elegans, Rudbeckia laciniata and Solidago virgaurea (Fig. 3, tracks 1, 3, 4 and 9, respectively) being intermediate in mass. 2.2. Purification and characterization of inhibitors from seeds 2.2.1. Safflower (C. tinctorius var. Goldtuft) Proteinase inhibitors were purified using affinity chromatography on trypsin­Sepharose followed by RP­ HPLC (Fig. 4A). Analytical IEF combined with visualisation using the gelatin replicas method showed that the major HPLC peak contained T/C/SI and the smaller peak SI while weak TI were present in a minor fraction eluted before the other inhibitors. Micropreparative IEF followed by a second RP­HPLC separation gave fractions containing T/C/SI and SI (Fig. 4B).

An initial attempt to sequence the major safflower inhibitor (T/C/SI) failed because the N-terminal amino acid residue was blocked. The inhibitor was therefore cleaved with subtilisin and cysteine residues blocked by alkylation with N-isopropyl iodacetamide (NIPIA). HPLC revealed five peaks in the reaction mixture, not shown, with peak B corresponding to subtilisin and peak C to the intact inhibitor (Mr 7555, Table 2) modified with one molecule of NIPIA (Mr 199). The masses of peaks D (Mr 4848) and E (Mr 2923) were consistent with their production by cleavage of the modified inhibitor at the active site. The N-terminal sequence of peptide E was determined for 10 residues (Table 3) and comparison with protein sequence databases revealed homology with sequences adjacent to the P1 residues at the active sites of members of the potato I chymotrypsin inhibitor family. The safflower SI gave an identical N-

terminal sequence to peptide E. The mass of the SI (7572) differed from that of the intact T/C/SI (7555) by only 17 units which is consistent with its origin by cleavage of the T/C/SI at the active site during purification. 2.2.2. Cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus) Fractions enriched for inhibitors by affinity chromatography on trypsin­Sepharose and chymotrypsin­ Sepharose columns were separated by IEF (Fig. 5, tracks 1 and 2) and inhibitors of trypsin (T), subtilisin (S) and chymotrypsin (C) detected using gelatin replicas. All the inhibitors showed activity against subtilisin and trypsin and/or chymotrypsin. The fractions from affinity chromatography were separated by RP­HPLC (see Fig. 6, tracks 3­20 for the chymotrypsin column, fractions from the trypsin column are not shown) and selected fractions from the chymotrypsin column (Fig. 5, tracks 6, 9, 14) were separated by micropreparative IEF followed by a second separation by RP­HPLC. This resulted in the purification of six inhibitors corresponding to bands a and d­h in Fig. 5. They had similar Mr ranging from 7670 to 7792, the differences being consistent with bands e (T/SI) and g (C/SI) being derived from proteolytic cleavage of bands d (T/SI) and f (C/SI), respectively (the differences being 18 and 17 mass units). Sequencing of components e (T/SI), g (C/SI) and a (T/C/SI) showed homology to members of

ferences in Mr (Table 2) indicated that h4 and h9 were both proteolytically cleaved forms of the main TI component h14, corresponding to SFTI-1, and this was confirmed for h4 which showed sequence corresponding to the active site of SFTI-1 (Table 5). The other sunflower inhibitors had Mr ranging from 7596 to 7723 (Table 2), with one TI and five T/SI. Comparison of their Mr indicates that h29 (TI) could be derived from h31 (T/SI) by proteolysis leading to loss of activity against subtilisin. Similarly h33 (T/SI) could be derived from h35 (T/SI). No sequences of these components were determined but h35 (T/SI) was found to be N-terminally blocked. 2.2.4. Other species The major TI in seeds of Zinnia elegans had a mass of 11,350. N-terminal sequencing for 20 residues showed no relationship to other inhibitors of the Compositae but limited homology to Bowman­Birk type inhibitors from various sources (Table 6). This sequence was therefore, confirmed using a second sample prepared using affinity chromatography, RP­HPLC and micropreparative SDS electrophoresis followed by transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane. Similar analyses showed one T/SI component (Mr 7449) and at least 14 TI components in seeds of Gaillardia aristata. Seven of these were purified showing that most had Mr ranging from 10,238 to 11,372 with one of Mr 14,753. N-terminal sequencing did not give clear results, possibly due to microheterogeneity of the fractions. Analyses of Silphium perfoliatum seeds showed an Nterminally blocked TI of Mr 11,439 while a T/C/SI of Mr 7606 was demonstrated in Centaurea cyanus and two possibly related T/SI of Mr 7482 and 7542 in Taraxacum officinale (dandelion).

3. Discussion Results from mass determination (Table 2) and amino acid sequencing (Tables 3­6) indicate that the proteinase (C, S, T) inhibitors present in seeds of the Compositae fall into three major classes, as summarised in Table 7. The most widespread group appears to be related to the potato inhibitor I family, with Mr ranging from 7450 to 7800 and activity against two or three serine proteinases (T/SI, C/SI, T/C/SI). These inhibitors can be expected to be active against extracellular proteinases of pathogenic fungi such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea and may, therefore, be involved in defense mechanisms. In terms of evolutionary relationships, this family of inhibitors occurs in only low amounts with one or two isoforms being present in each species in the Carduiodeae, which is considered to be one of the most primitive subfamilies of the Compositae (Bremer, 1996), but is highly heterogeneous in some

the potato inhibitor I family, with e and g giving sequences related to the active site region (cf safflower peptide e) (Table 3) while component a gave a sequence related to the N-termini (Table 4). This indicates that the sequences determined for components e and f resulted from cleavage at the active site during purification, the N-termini of the intact proteins being blocked. 2.2.3. Sunflower (H. annuus) Affinity chromatography on trypsin­Sepharose followed by RP­HPLC, micropreparative IEF and a second RP­HPLC separation was used to purify several TI and T/SI components (Fig. 6), the former being represented by components h4, h9, h14 and h21.

groups of the advanced subfamily Asteroideae, especially in the tribe Heliantheae (Helianthus, Cosmos, Bidents, Dahlia). In sunflower (Helianthus annuus) these inhibitors can be used to differentiate lines and varieties while the absence of some components (c­f) from perennial diploid species with the A genome confirms the significant evolutionary separation of the A and B genomes present in diploid species. It is interesting that diploid perennial species of Helianthus also lack several helianthinin (11S storage globulin) components characteristic of annual forms (Anisimova, 1996).

Partial amino acid sequences were determined for the N-terminus of one inhibitor related to the potato inhibitor I family (Cosmos T/C/SIs) but the T/C/SI from Carthamus was N-terminally blocked. However, sequences corresponding to the active site residues (starting at residue P0 1) were determined for a second component from Carthamus (SI) and two components from Cosmos. In each case these appeared to be derived from cleavage of an N-terminally blocked inhibitor at the active site during affinity purification, as summarised in Table 7. However, in some cases the putative cleaved and native

inhibitors showed different specificities (the SI and T/C/ SI of Carthamus and the TIh29 and T/SIh31 of Helianthus) which indicates that cleavage may result in subtle differences in the active site geometry. The sequences determined are clearly homologous with those of other members of the potato inhibitor I family with particularly high identify of TI (e) from Cosmos with a PI from Fagopyrum esculentum, T/C/SI from Carthamus and T/ C/SI (a) from Cosmos with TI from Amaranthus hypochondriacus and C/SI (g) from Cosmos with PI from Arabidopsis thaliana. This may indicate the existence of several major variants of inhibitors of the potato inhibitor I family (at least in parts of sequences in regions near reactive sites) which are present in plants and animals. Analyses of the Carthamus T/C/SI also indicated the presence of only one cysteine residue which is consistent with other members of the potato inhibitor I family. The greater heterogeneity of TSI in the Heliantheae in comparison with the Cardueae may be due to an amphidiploid origin of their apparently diploid genomes (Sossey-Alaoui et al., 1996). A high level of polymorphism and variability in T/C/SI belonging to the potato I inhibitor family is also characteristic of other plant groups, for example in wheat (Triticum aestivum)

(Poaceae) where such inhibitors can be used for varietal identification (Konarev, 1988). Two other types of trypsin inhibitors found in seeds of the Compositae may be related to the Bowman­Birk inhibitor (BBI) family. The first type comprises a unique cyclic peptide inhibitor of Mr 1514 (SFTI-1) previously characterized from seeds of sunflower (Luckett et al., 1999). The present study resulted in the isolation of two peptides (h4 and h9) with identical masses but different pI and hydrophobicities which appeared to be derived from SFTI-1 by proteolysis. Sequence analysis of h4 confirmed that it was derived from SFT1 by cleavage between the P1 and P0 1 residues (Table 5) and a related peptide appeared to also be present in seeds of Tithania diversifolia but not in other species. These inhibitors appear to be derived from the trypsin-reactive loop of a BBI, perhaps by the action of a transpeptidase enzyme to introduce a cyclic structure (Luckett et al., 1999). Cyclic trypsin inhibitors with Mr higher than 3,000 belonging to a different protein family were recently reported in some Cucurbitaceae (FelizmenioQuimio et al., 2001) and it is possible that inhibitors with cyclic structures are widely distributed in plants. Other TI detected in seeds of sunflower in this (e.g. band

b) and previous studies (TI of Mr 2,500, Konarev et al., 2000a) have not been characterized in sufficient detail to determine their relationships. A novel type of TI with Mr of 11,350 (ZTI) was identified in seeds of Zinnia, while inhibitors of Mr 10,238 and 11,372 in Gaillardia and of 11,439 in Silphium could belong to the same family. Sequence comparisons indicated that these could be related to the Bowman-Birk inhibitors (BBI) which are widely distributed in seeds of legumes and other species including cereals. Most BBI have Mr of 8000­9000 but duplicated forms of Mr about 14,000 are present in some cereal seeds (Shewry, 1999). The N-terminal sequence of ZTI contained a pentapeptide motif (PWEQC) which was similar to sequences close to the N-termini of BBI from cereals such as barley (PWECC), rice (PWEDC) and Job's tears (Coix lachryma-jobi) (PWECC) (see Table 6). However, this motif is not present in Bowman-Birk inhibitors from legumes or other dicotyledonous species and similar motifs also occur in pectolytic enzymes and cereal prolamins (Okita et al., 1985; Robert et al., 1993). The ZTI also lacked cysteines in positions equivalent to those that stabilize the first reactive loop (i.e. Cys9 and Cys17 in the Vigna radiata sequence shown in Table 6). However, these cysteines are also absent from the first domain of the duplicated D1 inhibitor of rice (Table 5). Furthermore, the ZTI has a basic residue (Lys) in the position corresponding to the active site (Lys11 in V. radiata, Lys or Arg in other BBI). It is possible, therefore, that the ZTI is distantly related to the BBI but further studies are required to confirm this. A further TI (Mr 14,753) was present in Gaillardia seeds but was not characterized in detail. The studies reported here confirm that seeds of the Compositae are rich sources of proteinase inhibitors, belonging to at least three separate families. Although their biological roles remain unknown it can be speculated that at least some are involved in conferring resistance to pests and pathogens. It will, therefore, be of interest to determine their activities against fungal pathogens and extracellular proteinases in relation to their potential exploitation to confer resistance in transgenic plants.

Seed and leaf material from herbarium specimens collected after 1960 and fresh leaves stored at À20  C were used in addition to seeds. 4.2. Proteins 4.2.1. Extraction For analytical separation, proteins were extracted from ground seeds or leaves by shaking with water (1:4 w/v) for 1 h at 20  C. For preparative separation, milled seeds were defatted with hexane and extracted with water (1:10 w/v). The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000Âg at 20  C. 4.2.2. Analytical separation Protein fractions were separated by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in Servalyt Precotes pH 3­10 gels (Serva) (Konarev et al., 2000a) and Phast gels pH 5­8 (Pharmacia), by thin layer gel-filtration (TLGF) in Sephadex G-50 (Konarev, 1982) or by SDS electrophoresis in Phast High Density gels after reduction with 2-mercapthoethanol. Proteins were stained with Coomassie BB R250. Horse myoglobin (pI 7.3) and cytochrome c (pI 10.6) were used as pI markers. 4.2.3. Detection of inhibitors Proteinase inhibitors were detected after analytical separation of native proteins by the gelatin replicas method using a gelatin layer on photographic film (Konarev, 1986; Konarev et al., 2000a). Two or three replicas were sequentially placed in contact with the same IEF gel for 2, 5 and 20 min, respectively. The replicas were then applied to 0.8% (w/v) agarose gels containing 0.1 M Na2HPO4 (pH 9) and one of the following proteinases (Sigma); trypsin (1 mg/ml), chymotrypsin (10 mg/ml) and subtilisin (0.3 mg/ml), and incubated at 45  C for 30 min. The activities of inhibitors in extracts were estimated based on the volume of extract required to obtain inhibitor banding patterns. Volumes below 0.3 ml, therefore, were defined as ``high activity''; volumes up to 2.5 ml as ``weak'' and the failure to detect digestion with 5 ml extract was defined as ``low or absent''. 4.2.4. Purification of proteins Single inhibitor components were purified by combining affinity chromatography, reversed-phase HPLC (Konarev et al., 2000a) and micropreparative isoelectric focusing or SDS­PAGE. Ammonium acetate was added to the crude protein extract to 0.2 M and 1 l of extract

In: Proceedings International Safflower Conference, MT. Konarev, Al.V., Kochetkov, V.V., Bailey, J.A., Shewry, P.R., 1999b. The detection of inhibitors of the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib) de

was shaken for 1 h with 15 ml of trypsin- or chymotrypsin­Sepharose gel. The gel was then washed with 0.4 l of 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.3 l of 0.1 M Na2HCO3 or 0.1 M Na2HPO4 and 0.3 l of water and packed into a column. Inhibitors were eluted with 0.015 M HCl, freeze-dried and subjected to HPLC on a C18 reversedphase (RP) Vydac column with an acetonitrile gradient (ranges 20­50, 20­40 or 28­40% (v/v)). Fractions were freeze-dried and inhibitors detected by analytical IEF combined with the gelatin replicas method. HPLC-fractions containing proteinase inhibitors were separated on Servalyt precotes (pH 3­10) gels and transferred to PVDF-membrane or eluted from the gel. Protein bands were visualized by washing in a saturated solution of ammonium sulphate for 3 min, excised and eluted with 100­300 ml of water for 1 h. The eluate was then subjected to a second separation by RP­HPLC. For micropreparative SDS­PAGE, the reduced protein fractions from HPLC were separated on a Phast highdensity gel, transferred to PVDF-membrane by diffusion at 50  C for 1 h and visualized with Coomassie BB R250. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed on a Thermoquest LCQ instrument operating in positive ion mode. Samples were dissolved in 1:1 methanol/water containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid and infused into the instrument at 3 ml/min. The spray voltage was 5kV and the capillary operated at 210  C. Deconvolution was carried out using the Biomass program in Excalibar software version 1.2. Cleavage of inhibitors by proteinases. Twenty micrograms of purified inhibitor dissolved in 100 ml of 0.1 M ammonium acetate, pH adjusted to 9.0 by ammonium hydroxide, was mixed with 20 mg of trypsin or subtilisin and incubated at 45o C for 4 days. Cysteine residues were blocked by N-isopropyl iodacetamide (NIPIA) after reduction with DTT.
