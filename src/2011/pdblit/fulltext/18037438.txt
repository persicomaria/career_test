Phage T4 internal protein I(IPI), a small (ca, 10,000 MW), basic protein injected into the host with the phage DNA, is not required for infection of most hosts, but mutants defective in IPI are restricted by at least one naturally occurring strain of Escherichia coli, CT 596 (CT). Phages lacking IPI (IPII) appear to inject their DNA and bind it to the membrane of CT cells as well as wild-type phage T4 does, but shufoff of host protein synthesis, initiation of T4 protein synthesis, and cell killing are abnormal in the IPI mutant infected CT host. The injection of IPI appears to be important in allowing T4 DNA to carry out early steps involved in takeover of this host. Restriction of IPI- phage growth by CT cells appears to be due, at least in part, to a defective prophage it harbors which renders the host resistant to successful infection by phage T4 which lack IPI or rII functions. Bacteria cured of this prophage can be infected by mutants defective in these functions. The resistance of CT cells to other coliphages, and the question of T-even phage internal protein diversity are discussed. INTRODUCTION

A preceding paper described the isolation and properties of phage T4 mutants which lack the three major internal proteins found within the phage head (Black, 1974). These three internal proteins-IPI, IPII, and IPIII-can be isolated from headmutant defective infected bacteria in a protein complex with a fourth internal protein found only within a head precursor, the product of the T4 head gene 22 (~22). This protein complex appears to be related to an assembly core which functions to initiate head formation (Showe and Black, 1973). The proteins p22 and IPIII appear to have roles in head assembly, and these head protein precursors are cleaved during head formation, remaining within the mature head as the internal peptides and IPIII* (Showe and Black, 1973; Laemmli, 1970). Only ~22, however, is absolutely required for head formation, since mutants which eliminate the internal proteins found in the mature head-IPI, IPII, and IPIII*are viable, although IPIII is necessary for

efficient head assembly (Black, 1974; Showe and Black, 1973). Unlike IPIII, the two small internal proteins IPI and IPII found in the mature head have no detectable influence upon phage growth or assembly in many laboratory strains of E. coli (Black, 1974; Showe and Black, 1973). Why are these small (ca 10,000 MW) basic proteins which are synthesized immediately after infection (Black and Ahmad-Zadeh, 1971; Black and Gold, 1971) incorporated within the phage head? They might be without function but be incorporated because of charge interaction with DNA, function in assembly under certain conditions, or, since one or more are believed to be injected with the DNA (Hershey, 1955; Levine et al., 1958; Bachrach et al., 1970), the internal proteins could be of use to the mature particle in carrying out infections of certain hosts. In this paper it is shown that IPI, a protein injected into the host with the DNA, is specifically required for growth of T4 in at least one naturally occurring strain

of E. coli. T4 phages lacking IPI are blocked at a very early stage of infection of this host; injection of parental IPI appears to be necessary for the T4 DNA to carry out early steps in host takeover. Restriction of IPI phage growth by this strain appears to be due, at least in part, to a defective prophage it harbors which renders the host resistant to successful infection by phage T4 which lacks the IPI or rI1 functions. Bacteria cured of this prophage are susceptible to infection by mutants defective in either of these genes.

RESULTS

These are generally given previously (Black and Ahmad-Zadeh, 1971; Black, 1974). a. Bacteria and Phages

E. coli CT596 (CT) was one of 27 naturally occurring strains of E. coli which were kindly provided by Dr. W. B. Wood. These and other more widely used laboratory strains of E. coli (see Black, 1974) were tested for susceptibility to infection by various phages and mutants of these phages. CT596 was also classified as E. coli by the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia. It grows at 30" in M9S with a doubling time of 35 min, and in M9 with a doubling time of 50 min, and appears to be su-. T41 (HA35) which lacks IPI antigen was isolated as described (Black, 1974). T41 (KA342) was isolated from T4B deletion eG342 : Sl2 (e-III-) by hydroxylamine mutagenesis as a mutant which lacked IPI antigen. It was backcrossed 2 times with T4D at high T4D : I- input ratios, and has lost most or all of the original deletion, eG342, since it is e+ and III+. E. coli K12W3102strHsu and E. coli K12W3102str"su(X ind-) were from the laboratory of Dr. M. Meselson and were provided by Dr. Marc Rhoades. E. coli K12W3102strRsu(X+) and E. coli K12W3102strHsu-(Xi434) were prepared from X+ and Xi434 which originated in the laboratory of Dr. A. D. Kaiser.

a. T4 Requires IPI for Growth CT

on E. coli

Phage T4D+ grows relatively well on E. coli CT and produces small sharp plaques; both efficiencies of plating and burst sizes are high (Table 1). Two IPI mutants, I(HA35) and I(KA342), which are indistinguishable from T4D+ when grown on E. coli B' (and many other E. coli strains), grow very poorly on CT. Both mutants produce plaques on CT with frequencies of only about lOme; there is no background of minute plaques on a CT plate which has received a large number of I- phages. Restriction of IPI- phages is highly specific, since phages lacking the other two T4 internal proteins, IPII and IPIII, grow as well as T4+, while IP" phages lacking all three IPs are restricted (Table la). In spot tests T4 clears CT completely, but the IPI mutants produce no clearing and poor retardation of bacterial growth even at

relatively high phage concentrations. Burst size measurements (Table lb) indicate that only a small fraction of the Iphages added to CT initiates infection that portion (generally successfully; 0.01-0.02 of the added phages) which yields progeny produces a nearly normal burst. Measurements of the kinetics of Iphage growth in CT show that those mutants which initiate infection successfully produce progeny at the same rate as T4D+ (the first T4 or I- phage per infective center is produced at about 21 min after infection at 30" in M9S, as is found for infection of E. coli B' under the same conditions). A number of observations strongly suggest that T4D specifically requires IPI to grow on E. coli CT. First, two independently isolated I- mutants, determined by immunological criteria and low pH urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to lack IPI protein within the phage head, fail to grow on CT. Second, 20 revertant plaques from I(KA342) and 3 from I(HA35), found at about lOA frequency on CT, were purified; all were able to grow as well as T4D-t on CT and all had reverted to production of IPI antigen, as judged by reaction of disrupted phage proteins against IPI antiserum. Furthermore, deletion eG506 is completely overlapped by deletion eG192, except that deletion eG506 extends several hundred nucleotide pairs farther toward gene 57 from gene e than does deletion eG192 (Wilson et al., 1973; see Fig. 3,

Black, 1974); it is presumably because of this slightly longer deletion toward gene 57 that eG506 fails to produce IPI, whereas eG192 synthesizes IPI. Both mutants lack the T4 tRNAs (Wilson et al., 1973). Although neither mutant grows well on CT, eG506 grows much more poorly, as determined by spot tests and by measurement of phage production in liquid culture. This suggests again that gene I is critical for growth on CT. Finally, since I- mutants do not grow on CT, nor do T4 amber mutants, gene I can be mapped by crosses with T4 amber mutants in adjacent genes. These recrosses (Fig. 1) show the mutation stricted by CT to be located where gene I was mapped by crosses tested immunologically for IPs and by deletion eG506 (Black, 1974). We conclude that for growth on CT T4 requires the function associated with IPI antigen incorporation into the phage head. b. IPI- Infection of CT

One explanation for the failure of Imutants to grow on CT would be their reduced ability to adsorb, although Imutants do not adsorb or infect standard E. coli strains more slowly than does

The order e I 57 was also supported by 3-factor crosses between I(HA3.5) and the double mutants 50.57 (am A 458, am 198) (1.8% recombination); 57, e(am 198. am H26) (0.6% recombination); and 49, e(am E727, am H26) (5.6% recombination).

T4D + . However, T4D + and I- also adsorb with identical kinetics to CT (Fig. 2), although adsorption is poor compared with adsorption to E. coli B", and may explain the small, sharp plaques produced by T4+. This could also be due to the production of mucoid or otherwise resistant bacteria in the CT population under some growth conditions. While the variable, but generally poor adsorption properties of the strain make it necessary to work with fresh single colony isolates, and sometimes difficult to study phage growth in liquid cultures, the difference between T4+ and I- growth on CT is highly reproducible. Another possible explanation for the failure of I- mutants to grow successfully on CT would be poor injection of I- DNA into CT. I- or IP" phage apparently inject their DNA into E. coli B" as well as T4+ (Black, 1974) suggesting that internal proteins do not generally play a necessary role in

injection. One indication that I-DNA is also injected into CT is that I- genomes are rescued by simultaneous infection of CT with T4+ (Table 2). Similarly, spot tests

can be used to classify mutants which complement each other on CT, and while I- mutants do not complement each other, I- mutants do complement amber or other T4 mutants blocked in growth on CT. T4 gene I is unusual because its product, IPI, is synthesized immediately after infection, and is also injected into the host along with the DNA. This property raises the question of whether injected or newly synthesized IPI primarily carries out the IPI function, when necessary, within the infected cell. Although this has not been determined, it appears that injected IPI does function in growth on CT. When I+ and I- phages are grown together in E. coli B", and then used to infect CT, it appears that the I- genomes which have undergone phenotypic mixing are better able to give rise to progeny than they are when they have been grown alone in E. coli BE (Table

3). Interpretation of this experiment is complicated by the fact that all the phages produced by the mixed I+ : I- burst from E. coli B' might be expected to contain less IPI. This would depend upon the unknown pool size of IPI relative to the number of heads formed in the infected cell, and the ratio of I- to I+ phages in the mixed infection of E. coli B". Nevertheless, it appears from the data that I+ and Iphages can undergo phenotypic mixing, and that I- phages which carry some IPI are better able to infect CT than I- phages without IPI.

late times after infection, many phages and phage-filled bacteria are seen in the T4 infected culture as compared with the Iinfected culture. At early times after infection (10 min at 30"), in both T4+ and Iinfected cultures, most of the bacteria have adsorbed phages, the majority of which have contracted sheaths and empty heads in both the wild-type and mutant infections. A large proportion of the I- infected bacteria do not lyse upon 0~0, treatment at late times, and no abnormal or incomplete phage structures are present. It therefore appears that I- phage development is blocked at an early stage of infection of CT. In order to examine the defectiveness of I- infected CT, E. coli CT were infected with either T4+ or I- at multiplicities of infection of 5 or 20, labeled with radioactive amino acids at various times after infection, and extracts of the infected bacteria examined by electrophoresis on SDSpolyacrylamide gels. It appears (Fig. 3) that in the T4+ infected cultures, host protein bands (dots) have disappeared by 5 min after infection at either multiplicity, and then are replaced by the pattern of proteins characteristic of normal T4 development (arrows). In the I(HA35) or I(KA342) infected cells, however, inhibition of host protein synthesis appears defective, and it is only at high multiplicities of infection that synthesis of T4 specific proteins is appreciable. Therefore it appears that inhibition of host protein synthesis and initiation of T4 specific protein synthesis is less effective in the I- than in the T4+ infected cells. That few if any T4 proteins are synthesized by most of the mutant infected bacteria can be more readily appreciated when host protein synthesis is suppressed by UV irradiation prior to infection with T4 or I- phages (Fig. 4). Bacteria infected by T4+ at multiplicities of 5 or 20 show considerable incorporation of radioactive amino acids into early and late T4 proteins as judged by the results of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The I- infected bacteria show very little incorporation of radioactivity into T4 directed proteins even at multiplicities of infection of 20. These results suggest that I- infection of CT is blocked prior to

induction of the first stage of T4-directed protein synthesis. Another indication of a very early block in I- infection of CT is that CT is killed more efficiently by T4+ than by I- (Fig. 5). When E. coli B' are infected with increasing multiplicities of T4+ or I- phages, the fraction of surviving bacteria is reduced identically in either type of infection. When the same phages are used to infect E. coli CT, killing of CT falls on lines whose two distinct slopes indicate that T4+ kills CT more efficiently than II. Although I- phages infect and kill most E. coli strains as well as T4+, and Igenomes are rescued by simultaneous infection of CT with T4+, many of these experiments could suggest that I- phages, when unaided by coinfection with IPI+ containing phages, inject their DNA more poorly than wild type phages. DNA attachment to the E. coli membrane has been measured by the M-band technique (Earhart, Tremblay, Daniels and Schaechter, 1968). This attachment, which appears to be necessary for replication, occurs very early after infection, even in the absence of T4 specific protein synthesis. Superinfecting phages which are excluded from replication, however, inject but do not attach their DNA to the membrane, as measured by the M-band technique. Therefore, binding of the T4 DNA to the membrane is thought to be an early, and necessary, step in development (Earhart et al., 1968, 1973). The M-band technique was used to examine T4-t and I- infection of E. coli B' or E. coli CT, in order to determine the extent of I-DNA ejection from the phage head into a DNase-sensitive state, and the extent of T4+ and I- DNA attachment to the CT M-band membrane fraction. T4+ and I- phages containing 3H-thymidine labeled DNA were used to infect E. coli B' or E. coli CT. Not unexpectedly, T4+ and Iwere indistinguishable in the extent to which they associated their radioactive DNA with the M-band membrane fraction following infection of E. coli BF (data not shown). In addition, T4+ and I- phages are also similar in their ability to attach DNA to the M-band fraction of CT in-

tive to DNase treatment; and that similar fractions of the parental T4+ and I- DNA became associated with the M-band. However, dilution of a portion of the infected cultures from chloramphenicol shows that

Required for Growth on CT and Restriction Functions of CT

We wanted to identify other T4 genes required specifically for growth on E. coli CT. Mutants restricted in growth on CT were sought by plating heavily mutagenized phages (Tessman, 1965) on a mixed lawn of E. coli B' and CT, and turbid plaques were tested by spotting on E. coli B' or CT seeded plates. About 30 mutants were grown for testing, and many were found to lie in the same complementation group when tested on CT. A number of these mutants were mapped in crosses with amber mutants distributed about the T4 genetic map, and were found to be closely linked to genes 39 and 60. It was then found that most of these mutants lay in the rIIA or B cistrons and that rI1 mutants fail to grow on E. coli CT. Subsequent attempts to identify other genes specifically required for growth on CT by plating mutagenized phages on E. coli K12 sum(X) and CT have shown that most of these rarely occurring

Portions of the infected cultures were diluted 10e5 into cold M9s for determination of the fraction of surviving bacteria, and 10m5 into H broth following 10 min mixing with T4 antiserum for measurement of T4+ or I- development (infectious centers). The remainders of the infected cultures were centrifuged 5 min at 5000 rpm, resuspended in 0.5 ml 15% sucrose in 0.01 MTris, pH 8, and then 0.1 ml of a mixture of egg white lysozyme (2 mg/ml in 0.25 M Tris, pH 8.1) and Na,EDTA (2.7 mg/ml) were added. Of the infected cultures, 0.4 ml was immediately transferred to sucrose gradients, and after 30 min at 4", 0.2 ml of 0.1 M MgSO,, and 0.1 ml of 5% Sarkosyl N-30 (Geigy) were added and mixed with the spheroplasted bacteria. After 15 min, the bacteria were centrifuged 20 min at 15,000 rpm in a SW 25 rotor, and 3-ml fractions were collected. The gradient was formed from a 5-ml underlayer of 47% sucrose to which was added a 25-ml linear gradient of 15% to 40% sucrcse prepared in 0.01 M Tris, pH 7.0, 0.01 M MgSO,, 0.1 M KCl, and 0.02% NaN,.

mutations lie in gene I. Classification of other leakier mutations is not complete, and it is not yet known whether or what genes other than rI1 and I are required for growth on CT. The failure of rI1 mutants to grow on CT suggested the possibility that the strain might be lysogenic. When CT is irradiated with ultraviolet light or grown in the presence of Mitomycin C (Fig. 7) growth levels off, some lysis generally occurs after some time and becomes considerable upon treatment of the culture with chloroform. No phages have been detected in such a lysate when it is plated on a number of E. coli strains including cured strains of CT, and no phages or phage parts have been detected in the electron microscope. These properties of CT suggest it may carry a defective prophage. When CT was heavily irradiated with ultraviolet light to about lo-' survivors, a number of them appeared to be cured. Cured strains occur very rarely among the heavily irradiated survivors, as is also

found for some defective h lysogens (Eisen et al., 1966). The cured survivors were detected as nibbled colonies by spreading heavily irradiated CT onto plates onto which either lo6 T4rII1272 (deletion of the A and B cistrons) or I- phage T4 mutants had been previously spread. These derivatives of CT are cured in the sense that they seem to behave as nonlysogens upon treatment with ultraviolet light or Mitomycin C (Fig. 7), and those tested are also more resistant to killing by ultraviolet light than CT. The cured CT colonies tested (6) are sensitive to growth of both rI1 and Imutants which grow about as well as T4-t as judged by efficiencies of plating (Table 4) or by spot tests. Therefore the defective growth on CT of both T4rII and I- mutants appears related, perhaps by the presence of the defective prophage. It is well known that rI1 mutants fail to grow on lambda lysogens (Benzer, 1955), or in E. coli lysogenie for some other temperate phages (Dove, 1968). I- mutants grow on E. coli

DISCUSSION

Phage T4 internal protein I, which is dispensable for phage growth in many hosts, is required for successful infection of of Ithe E. coli strain CT. Restriction mutants by this strain is stringent, since revertants which occur at a frequency of about 1Om6revert to IPI antigen production, and the transmission coefficient on CT is generally about 0.01. Mutants which escape restriction in a small fraction of the infected bacteria seem to produce progeny as well and at the same rate as T4+, suggesting that no block against I- growth in CT persists once infection is successfully initiated. Evidence from phenotypic mixing suggests that injected rather than newly synthesized IPI has the primary role in facilitating infection of CT. This evidence is not compelling, but this would explain a need for the incorporation of IPI into the phage head. This is reasonable, since the block against IPI- infection of CT seems to prevent any T4 protein synthesis. However, since IPI is synthesized as an immediate early protein within the cell, newly synthesized IPI might also, if necessary, promote initial stages of infection. IPI is injected into E. coli B' or CT with the DNA, and the injected IPI remains largely combined with the DNA-membrane fraction of the infected cell at low salt concentrations (unpublished experiments). However, the mechanism of action

of IPI or the site at which it acts to promote initial stages of infection in E. coli CT are obscure. T4 DNA appears to enter CT equally well in the presence or absence of IPI, since it is rescued by coinfection by T4+, and even in the absence of coinfection, I- DNA seems to be bound to the same extent as T4-t DNA with the Mband-membrane fraction of CT cells. It appears that I- DNA is not fully functional in the CT cell, since host shutoff, T4 protein synthesis, and to some extent, killing are defective. In spite of the fact that I+ and I-DNA seem equally well bound to the M-band, an index of association with the host membrane (Earhart et al., 1968), it is possible that without IPI, the DNA is unable to cross the membrane to enter the cell, or if it does so, does not occupy a site necessary for subsequent activity. Alternatively, IPI might activate the CT protein synthesizing apparatus to permit initiation of T4 development, or IPI might protect T4 DNA from nuclease attack in the CT cell. These and other possible mechanisms are presently being investigated. It is interesting that CT appears to be resistant to both I- and rI1 mutants of T4 because it contains a defective prophage. If this prophage is of selective advantage to CT, it would also be of selective advantage for it to be stably integrated and difficult to cure, since once lost the strain could not reacquire the prophage through reinfection. It would be of significance if T4 rI1 and I- mutants were restricted by similar mechanisms or by the same prophage (and host) genes; however, I- mutants are not restricted by lambda lysogens or by lysogens of a number of other temperate phages. It is known that rI1 restriction by lambda lysogens is dependent upon functioning of the rex gene (Astrachan and Miller, 1972; Howard, 1967). The mechanism of interaction of this prophage gene with the T4 rI1 function is not understood. It is not yet known whether other lysogens of CT restrict I-; the parental and cured strains are resistant to lambda. T4D and T4B successfully infect CT which is resistant to phages T2, T6, T5, T7, lambda, and Pl, although these phages
