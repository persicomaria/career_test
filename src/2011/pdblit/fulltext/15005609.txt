ABSTRACT: The X-ray crystal structure of the Escherichia coli (Ec) direct oxygen sensor heme domain (Ec DosH) has been solved to 1.8 Å using Fe multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD), and the positions of Met95 have been confirmed by selenomethionine (SeMet) MAD. Ec DosH is the sensing part of a larger two-domain sensing/signaling protein, in which the signaling domain has phosphodiesterase activity. The asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice contains a dimer comprised of two differently ligated heme domain monomers. Except for the heme ligands, the monomer heme domains are identical. In one monomer, the heme is ligated by molecular oxygen (O2), while in the other monomer, an endogenous Met95 with S f Fe ligation replaces the exogenous O2 ligand. In both heme domains, the proximal ligand is His77. Analysis of these structures reveals sizable ligand-dependent conformational changes in the protein chain localized in the FG turn, the G -strand, and the HI turn. These changes provide insight to the mechanism of signal propagation within the heme domain following initiation due to O2 dissociation.

It is now recognized that a collection of heme-b-containing proteins comprise a functionally related group that couple small molecule sensing to biological signaling (1-3). Prominent among these heme proteins are the FixLs,1 which are multidomain proteins with separate domains employed for oxygen sensing (heme), signaling (catalytic), and in one case, membrane integration (4-12). These proteins typically form part of a more complex two-component cellular sensing and signaling system (4, 5, 7, 11). FixLs couple heme oxygenation status to expression of the complement of proteins required for nitrogen fixation through a second component, the response regulator FixJ (4, 5, 7-9). Of the heme proteins in this category that have so far been identified, the chemically best characterized are two bacterial FixLs (Sm FixL and Bj FixL) (1-3, 10, 12-25), followed by the Escherichia coli Dos (26-33). Compared to the FixLs,

the function of Dos in E. coli is more ambiguous but may involve changes between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Because of their size and the complications associated with handling the full-length FixL and Dos proteins, most work has focused initially on the recombinant heme-containing domain of each of these proteins (FixLH, DosH). Heme domains have also been the initial focus because they were the first identified heme-containing PAS1 proteins and because the signaling function begins in the heme domain, controlled by heme oxygenation status. As currently understood, dissociation of oxygen from the FixL heme domain (sensing domain) initiates the chemical signal that ultimately results in production of the proteins required to reduce atmospheric nitrogen (1-11). Accordingly, initiation and initial propagation of this signal must occur in the heme domain (1-3, 12, 14). To better understand this process, X-ray crystal structures of Sinorhyzobium meliloti (Sm) and Bradyrhizobium japonicum (Bj) FixL heme domains (FixLH) have been published (12-15, 25). These structures have resulted in various ideas concerning signal initiation and aspects of transduction within the heme domains (12-16, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 33). In the full-length proteins, FixL and Dos, the signal is transmitted to the protein's catalytic domain. In each FixL, this catalytic region is a kinase (8, 19), while in Dos, it functions as a phosphodiesterase (26, 27). Structurally, both (Sm and Bj) of the FixLH domains were shown to be PAS-heme proteins (12, 15), and by sequence analogy, Ec DosH was also inferred to be a PAS-heme domain. However, some properties of Ec DosH differ from those of the FixLHs (26). For example, Ec DosH was discovered to be low-spin, indicating a six-coordinate heme, whether or not an exogenous ligand was available for heme

Ec DosH Crystal Structure binding (26, 27). In contrast, the FixLHs were found to be five-coordinate in the absence of exogenous ligands (12-15). Ec DosH reacts with exogenous ligands such as O2, CO (in the ferrous form), and CN- (in the ferric form). These differently ligated forms can be distinguished by their optical spectra (26, 27), similar to the FixLHs (10, 19). In the absence of an exogenous ligand, it was reasoned that the Ec DosH heme must have a sixth ligand originating from the protein itself (an endogenous ligand). Evidence for this was obtained by site-specific mutagenesis experiments that implicated His77 and Met95 as heme ligands in DosH (27, 31). To further the structural characterization of Ec DosH and provide a basis for subsequent structural work on the fulllength Ec Dos protein, we have solved the crystal structure of Ec Dos heme domain (Ec DosH) using an Fe MAD method. Here, we describe the structures of Ec DosH-O2, which contains molecular oxygen as a ligand, and Ec DosH, in which there is no oxygen ligand. To confirm the existence of two different ligation states in the asymmetric unit, the Se Met form of Ec DosH was prepared and its structure also solved. The crystal structures of both Ec DosH and SeMetEc DosH are essentially identical when similarly ligated forms are compared and confirm that Ec DosH is related in structure to the FixLH proteins. The two structures, with (oxy monomer) and without (deoxy monomer) O2 ligation, represent the inactive and active Ec DosH protein forms, respectively, and provide further insight into the possible mechanics of the signaling mechanism within the heme domain. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Purification, SeMet Substitution, and Crystallization. Preparation and crystallization of the full-length Dos heme domain was performed as described previously (33). A plasmid harboring the E. coli Dos heme domain was used to transform E. coli 834(DE3) to make the SeMet-substituted protein. Cells were grown on M9 minimal media with seleno-L-methionine and a nutrient mixture. SeMet-substituted protein was purified and crystallized in the same manner as for the native protein (33). Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Analysis. The crystals were flash-frozen under a nitrogen stream at 100 K prior to data collection. An Fe MAD dataset of the native protein was collected at three wavelengths (in Å), 1.741 (peak), 1.7382 (edge), and 1.033 (remote), at the SSRL Beamline 9-2, and data for SeMet-DosH, 0.9796 (peak) and 0.9183 (remote), was collected at the ALS beamline 5.0.2. Data were processed and merged with the HKL software suite. The recombinant native Ec DosH structure was solved by the Fe MAD method (33). Briefly, determination of heavy atom positions, initial phasing, and CR atom tracing were performed using SOLVE and RESOLVE. The model was built into the electron density using the graphics program O. Iterative rounds of model adjustment using O and refinement using CNS were performed to improve the model. The refined model of Ec DosH was transformed to SeMet-DosH with one round of rigid body refinement, and SeMet-DosH then went through a separate refinement process using CNS. Data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure graphics, analysis, and viewing were carried out using the programs O and DS Viewer Pro (Accelrys). Protein

structures shown in the figures were superimposed by creating "anchors" at identical positions on the heme of each structure and then superimposing the structure so that the corresponding anchor points in each structure occupied identical coordinates. Typical anchor points were the heme R, , and  meso carbon atoms (Figure 1). In this way, any heme structure changes via ruffled, domed, or saddled distortions would be visible. The Fischer numbering system is commonly used throughout the discussion when referring to the heme (Figure 1). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank: recombinant native DosH, 1S66, and SeMet DosH, 1S67. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crystal structure of the heme-containing, oxygensensing domain of the recombinant E. coli direct oxygen sensor (Ec DosH) has been determined using heme Fe as a MAD scattering atom. This structure, especially the exact position of methiones, was confirmed by subsequently crystallizing the SeMet-substituted Ec DosH and determining its structure. Both native and SeMet-substituted proteins were crystallized in an orthorhombic space group, P212121, with two molecules in one asymmetric unit. The average rmsd value of backbone CR atoms between native (solved by Fe MAD) and SeMet-substituted Ec DosH was 0.278 Å, which emphasizes the similarity of the two structures. Unless otherwise indicated in the text, the results and discussion that follow refer specifically to the recombinant E. coli direct oxygen sensor (Ec DosH) structure and not the SeMetsubstituted Ec DosH.

The heme pyrrole rings are labeled using the crystallographic letter notation (A-D) and have the corresponding Fischer numbering A (IV), B (I), C (II), D (III). The meso-carbons and the pyrrole -carbons are labeled according to the Fischer notation. Panel B shows the electron density map of heme phased using Fe-MAD. Panels C and D are phased using Se-MAD in SeMet-DosH. Areas around the distal heme pocket of oxy monomer (C) and deoxy monomer (D) are shown contoured at 1. The two heme pockets with different ligation state (C, D) are viewed at the same orientation. Red coloring at the heme center in the electron density maps in panels C and D represent heme Fe, which was contoured at 5. In panel D, the ligating Se of Met95 is also represented in red and was also contoured at 5. In panel C, the blue coloring in the electron density map, representing ligated O2 and the free Se of Met95, was contoured at 3.

The protein backbone was traced, and most of the side chains were fitted using the Fe MAD map. The first and last residue seen in the electron density are, respectively, Asn16 and Ser134 for molecule A (oxy monomer) and Gly20 and Ser134 for molecule B (deoxy monomer). Residues 8991 of molecule A were also not visible in the electron density. The final R-factor is 18.9% (Rfree ) 22.4%) for 23 111 (101.8 Å) unique reflections. The root-mean-square deviation from the ideal for bond length is 0.023 Å, and for bond angle, it is 1.69°. There are 205 water molecules included in the final structure. The average B-factors of all non-hydrogen atoms (1943 atoms in 231 residues) are 24.5 and 23.9 Å2 for molecules A and B, respectively. A summary of the crystallographic data is given in Table 1. Global Structure. The asymmetric units of both crystalline Ec DosH samples have two independent molecules. Figure 2 shows the structure of the recombinant heme domain dimer of E. coli direct oxygen sensor (Ec DosH). However, the axial ligands of the individual heme domains that constitute a dimer are different. While both heme domains in the dimer contain His77 as the proximal heme ligand, what distinguishes them is that one monomer in each dimer contains heme-bound O2 as the sixth heme ligand, while in the other, the sixth ligand is Met95. Thus, each dimer contains both the O2-ligated heme domain (oxy monomer),

FIGURE 3: Alignment of Ec DosH (DosH), Bj FixLH (BjFX), and Sm FixLH (SmFX) according to secondary structure features defined by DSSP (38). The secondary structure elements are indicated in the top row (2°) of each group, defined by vertical lines, and occur as lighter face type in the individual sequences. Primary sequence (1°) numbers for each protein sequence are shown above each sequence. Brackets surround N-terminal and C-terminal sequence regions of the individual heme domains that were not identifiable in the crystal structures (12, 15, this work). Underlined portions indicate N-terminal and C-terminal helices that are not part of the R4 5 PAS core domain. The heme-coordinating proximal histidine in the middle of each FR helix is indicated by underline.

Verifying the nature of the different axial heme ligands in the two asymmetric unit proteins was carried out as follows. Sulfur atom positions of all the methionine residues, including Met95 in both ligation states were confirmed by crystallizing the SeMet-substituted Ec DosH and determining its structure (Figure 1D). From the early stage of refinement, the Fo - Fc map clearly showed electron density corresponding to O2 at the distal side of the heme in one of the monomers. In this native oxy monomer, the refined B-value for the liganded O2 is very similar to those for the carbonyl oxygen atoms of amino acid residues in the structure. The ligand coordination geometry of the oxy monomer structure also corresponds most closely to the O2-ligated Bj FixLH structure but not to the structures of Bj FixLH ligated with other diatomic molecules (CO, CN-, or NO) (12, 13). Both heme domains in the dimer are therefore sixcoordinate, as predicted from optical spectroscopy measurements (26). This fortuitous circumstance allows us to simultaneously analyze the subunit structures for both active and inactive Ec DosH. Figure 2 shows the three-dimensional dimer structure of recombinant native Ec DosH with the individual protein chains drawn as ribbons and with secondary structure elements labeled according to a previously proposed notation (26). In this labeling system, each distinct secondary structure element is consecutively labeled, A, B, C, ..., beginning with the -strand situated closest to the N-terminus. The specific structure element type (R-helix, -strand) is denoted as a subscript. Each Ec DosH monomer bears a striking global structural similarity to the previously characterized heme

oxygen-sensing proteins, Bj FixLH (3, 12-14) and Sm FixLH (15). Figure 3 summarizes additional comparisons between these three proteins that are the results of structure-based primary sequence alignments. These results come from analysis of the crystal structure of each protein using the program DSSP (38) to accurately define and identify specific secondary structure components. It can be seen from Figures 2 and 3 that each Ec DosH monomer contains five distinct R-helical regions; four are labeled C-F, and another, unlabeled, comprises the Nterminus. There are also five separate -strand regions, labeled A, B, G, H, and I. This R5 5 structure is also typical of Bj FixLH and Sm FixLH. The comparison shown in Figure 3, and the structure shown in Figure 2 confirm that the Ec DosH monomer is a PAS domain protein, similar to the FixLHs. All of these proteins contain the PAS core structure 2R4 3. In addition to the PAS 2R4 3 core both Ec DosH and Sm FixLH contain one or more N-terminal helices, while Bj FixLH contains a C-terminal helix. The dimer structure presented in Figure 2 shows the heme groups separated by 30 Å with an interface that includes the most hydrophobic surface of each Ec DosH monomer. The interface involves the N-terminal helix of each monomer, which together are juxtaposed, as well as the C-terminus of each subunit. The striking part about this interface is that in these features it is highly similar to the dimer interface described for the Sm FixLH dimer structure (15, 27). The hemes in both monomers within the Ec DosH dimer are sandwiched between the longest helical segment, FR, on the heme proximal side, and two strands, G and H , on

The heme is viewed edge-on with the distal ligand-binding side above the heme plane and the proximal side below the heme plane, showing His77 coordinated to the heme iron ion.

the heme distal (ligand-binding) side. In both monomers, the Ec DosH heme is coordinated by His77, whereas distal ligation employs an endogenous Met95 ligand in the absence of an exogenous ligand (Figures 1 and 4). Figure 2 shows that one side of the heme, pyrroles B and C (I and II, respectively, in Fischer notation), is solvent-shielded by additional strands (A , B , I ), whereas the side of the heme with the two propionate substituents, consisting of pyrroles A and D (pyrroles IV and III in Fischer notation) is quite solvent-exposed. Both of the heme propionates form hydrogen bonds directly to water molecules, as well as to other parts of the protein structure (vide infra). Heme Pocket EnVironment. Heme pocket environments for each of the differently ligated native Ec DosH monomers are shown in Figure 4. The presence or absence of O2 as a heme ligand causes significant rearrangements of many amino acid side chains that comprise the heme environment, which will be described in detail in the next section. However, the general environment around the hemes in both ligation states is very hydrophobic with nearest neighbors to the heme being isoleucines 36, 65, 69, and 81, leucines 73, 99, and 115, valine 92, asparagine 100, tyrosines 80 and 126, and tryptophan 53 (not shown). Such a hydrophobic heme environment excludes water on the distal or ligandbinding side of the heme. Structure Differences with and without O2 Ligation. There are significant and highly localized conformational differences in the global architecture of the two differently ligated monomer heme domains in the DosH structure, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. Visual inspection of the superimposed structures of the differently ligated heme domains, shown in Figure 5A,B, reveals that three regions are affected by the presence or absence of heme-coordinated O2. These are

Panel A presents a view looking perpendicular to the heme from the G -H -I strand side (distal side). Panel B presents a view looking toward the heme edge with the FR helix and the proximal side below the heme and the G strand above the distal side of the heme. The O2 ligand in Ec DosH-O2 is shown as a pair of spheres on the distal side of the heme. No other heme ligands are shown (see Figure 4).

the FG turn (residues 88-93), the early G strand (residues 94-97), and the HI turn (residues 121-122). These structural differences are quantified by the pairwise protein chain CR rmsd comparisons in Figure 6C. Several of the specific amino acid rearrangements in the Ec DosH heme pocket due to the presence or absence of O2 are shown in Figure 4. The changes are most dramatic on the distal side of the heme where the heme ligand is different. The most significant change involves the heme ligand, which is O2 in Ec DosH-O2. In the absence of an O2 ligand, the sixth heme coordination site is occupied by Met95, with S f Fe coordination, Figures 1D and 4.

Ec DosH Crystal Structure

FIGURE 6: Graphs of the backbone CR atom temperature factors of (A) oxy monomer and (B) deoxy monomer Ec DosH (values on left y-axis) and (C) the backbone CR atom rmsd values (right y-axis) between the Ec DosH oxy monomer and deoxy monomer as a function of primary sequence. The secondary structure regions are shown above the plotted values. Elevated temperature factors and rmsd values were observed in the FG and HI loops of both monomers. Temperature factors are generally lower in the deoxy monomer than in the oxy monomer, except for residues between 97 and 111.

O2 coordination is accompanied by a nearly 180° rotation of the side chain of Arg97. In the absence of O2 ligation, the Arg97 side chain is oriented toward the protein's surface and participates in a salt bridge with Arg112 and Glu98 (Figure 4, lower). In the oxy monomer, the Arg97 side chain reorients inward to the heme distal pocket to provide stabilization to heme-coordinated O2 (Figure 4, upper). Its role is that of a hydrogen bond donor, displaying Arg-N,,,O(heme-bound) distances of 2.70 and 2.94 Å. The Arg97 motion represents an 11.67 Å change in position for the guanidinium group. The side chain of Met95 also adopts radically different orientations in the two ligation states of Ec DosH. The difference is also a nearly 180° rotation from hemecoordinated (Figure 4, lower) to pointing toward the protein surface (Figure 4, upper). This motion involves a 10.91 Å change for the Met95 sulfur atom. Whereas both Met95 and Arg97 side chains make similarly large ligation-dependent conformational changes, their effects on the protein main chain is quite different with Met95 distorting the chain significantly. This can be seen by comparing CR coordinate differences (CR) in the two Ec DosH ligation states. For Met95, CR is 5.48 Å, while it is only 1.70 Å for Arg97. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, the effect of the Met95 change is transmitted further along the chain to the area between residues 89 and 96. This also results in a major distortion of the FG turn, including an order-disorder transition in residues 89-91. This structural distortion is demonstrated by the main chain comparison in Figure 5 and the rmsd graph in Figure 6 and is also reflected in the side chain displacements shown in Figure 4 (e.g., Glu93). Amino acid CR position differences for the two native Ec DosH ligation states are 4.98 Å for Lys87 and 4.83 Å for Ala88 (FG turn). A more subtle difference is that the change in ligation state also affects the structural stability of an area around the two amino acids directly involved in ligand binding (residues 95 and 97). This is indicated by the B-factor plots shown in Figure 6A,B). Residues between 86 and 95 including the FG loop are stabilized by Met95 ligation to the heme in the deoxy monomer. In contrast, the same area in the O2-ligated monomer is not stabilized efficiently by Arg97, even though this residue interacts with the ligand.

Because of this, residues 86-95 in the oxy monomer display high-temperature factors and the central residues 8991 become disordered. This order-disorder transition in residues 89-91 is shown in the B-factor plots in Figure 6. On the other hand, the adjacent area of the oxy monomer, between residues 97 and 111, becomes more stable than the comparable region of the deoxy monomer because of indirect anchoring of Arg97. Although the major ligand-dependent changes just described occur on the heme distal side, there are less significant changes for amino acids lying in the heme plane and on the heme proximal side. As shown in Figure 4, the most significant of these is the 115° ring rotation of Tyr80. The Fe-N bond distance between the heme iron and the imidazole group of His77 at the fifth coordination site is 1.98 and 1.95 Å for oxy-DosH and deoxy-DosH, respectively. The distances are slightly shorter than the Fe-N bond distance previously reported for the Bj FixL heme domain structures (13). The orientation of the imidazole group is fixed by a water-mediated hydrogen bond between N of His77 and O of Asp66 in Ec DosH-O2. Two water molecules are involved in a similar hydrogen bond mediation in the deoxy monomer. Water molecules at similar positions are also found in the FixL structures. Comparison of DosH and Bj FixLH Heme Pockets. Comparisons of the two types of heme pockets, as the locus of signal initiation in the FixLHs and in Ec DosH, are instructive and provide a basis for structure/function analysis. Figure 7 shows the combined heme pockets of Ec DosH-O2 (red) and Bj FixLH-O2 (blue) generated by superimposing the heme group of each protein. Both hemesensor domains contain histidine and molecular oxygen as heme axial ligands. Without O2 ligation (not shown), Bj FixLH is five-coordinate and high-spin, lacking a ligand at the sixth coordination position, but Ec DosH is six-coordinate with Met95 ligation (Figure 1D and 4). Similarities in the Bj FixLH and Ec DosH ligand binding site include the presence of arginine stabilizing hemecoordinated O2. This is shown by the positions of Arg97 (red, Ec DosH) and Arg220 (blue, Bj FixLH) in Figure 7 and is presumed to occur also in Sm FixLH, which has the corresponding Arg214, although no structure of Sm FixLH-O2 has yet been published.

FIGURE 7: Combined view of the heme environments for Ec DosH-O2 (red) and Bj FixLH-O2 (blue), created by superimposing the heme groups of each protein. Amino acids are numbered so that they can be identified from the primary sequences shown in Figure 3.

The nonpolar nature of the heme pocket in FixLHs is due to a "hydrophobic triad" of similarly situated distal amino acid side chains: Ile215(Bj)/Ile209(Sm), Leu236(Bj)/Leu230(Sm), and Ile236(Bj)/Val232(Sm). In Ec DosH, there is no amino acid that spatially corresponds to Ile215(Bj)/Ile209(Sm), but Phe113 and Leu115 correspond, respectively, to the other two members of the "hydrophobic triad" of the FixLHs. Leu99 in Ec DosH serves as a third hydrophobic heme contact in DosH, but it is situated more closely to the position occupied by Val222 in Bj FixLH than to the Ile215/ Ile209 position (Figure 7). Other corresponding hydrophobic side chains can be seen in Figure 7, including Ile65(Ec DosH)/Val88(Bj), Ile69(Ec DosH)/Met192(Bj), Tyr80(Ec DosH)/Tyr203(Bj), Tyr126(Ec DosH)/Phe249(Bj), Leu68(Ec DosH)/Leu191(Bj), and Trp53(Ec DosH)/Phe176(Bj). Comparison of Ec DosH and Bj FixLH Ligation-Dependent Structure Changes. Comparing the structural changes in native Ec DosH and Bj FixLH that depend on the presence or absence of an O2 ligand can delineate the conformational changes that accompany signal initiation. For Ec DosH, significant O2-dependent structural changes appear to be localized in the FG turn, early G strand, and HI turn, as shown in Figure 5. However, closer inspection of the coordinates reveals that the distortion of the FG turn is essentially continuous into the G strand, as illustrated by the rmsd differences shown in Figure 6C. This distortion can also be demonstrated by the corresponding amino acid differences between the O2-ligated and Met95-ligated structures, represented by CR in the FG/G region. At the end of the FR helix, CR is 0.73 Å for Arg82 but jumps to 6.70 Å for Val92 in the middle of the FG turn. In the G strand, the distortion continues, being 5.48 Å for Met95, 2.58 Å for Ser96 and 1.70 Å for Arg97. By comparison, the O2-induced structural changes in Bj FixLH are less extensive and of lower magnitude than those in Ec DosH. Figure 8 shows superimposed structures of O2ligated Bj FixLH (yellow, pdb; 1DP6) and ferrous unligated Bj FixLH (blue, pdb; 1LSW), analogous to the views of Ec DosH presented in Figure 5. It is immediately obvious that any structural differences in the FG and HI turn regions and the G strand of FixLH are not as extensive as those in Ec DosH. For example, in the FG turn, the maximum O2induced CR differences for Bj FixLH are 1.22 Å (Ser211) and 1.30 Å (Pro213). Thereafter in the sequence, chain

FIGURE 8: Two views of the superimposed global structures of the individual heme domains, Bj FixLH-O2 (yellow) and deoxy Bj FixLH (blue). The protein chain of each is shown as a tube, and these views are analogous to those shown for Ec DosH in Figure 5. Panel A presents a view looking perpendicular to the heme from the G -H -I strand side (distal side). Panel B presents a view looking toward the heme edge with the FR helix and the proximal side below the heme and the G strand above the distal side of the heme. The O2 ligand in Bj FixLH-O2 is shown as a pair of spheres on the distal side of the heme. No other heme ligands are shown.

overlap in the two forms improves until the early G strand where the coordinates diverge with CR being 2.06 Å (Gly217), 2.31 Å (Ile218), 2.35 Å (Gly219), and 1.99 Å (Arg220). Except for Arg220, these are all much smaller changes than those found for their structurally corresponding Ec DosH amino acids. The Arg220 side-chain reorientation upon O2-ligation is also much smaller than that found for Arg97 in Ec DosH. The terminal guanidinium group in Arg220 is required to move only 5.40 Å to stabilize hemebound O2 in Bj FixLH-O2. A proposed key element in signal initiation in Bj FixLH was an observed change in heme planarity accompanied by an alteration in the hydrogen bonding experienced by the heme propionates resulting from the ligation change (e.g., dissociation of heme-bound 2). In Bj FixLH-O2, the heme 7-propionate is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule and His214, while the heme 6-propionate is hydrogen-bonded to Arg206 and His214 (see Figure 5 in ref 14). After O2 dissociates, thereby initiating signal transduction, the 7-propionate ends up hydrogen-bonded to both His214 and Arg220, while the 6-propionate hydrogen bonds to His214 and a water molecule. Judging from the two Bj FixLH crystal structures (pdb; 1DP6 and 1LSW), the results of this shift in hydrogen bonding are changes in each propionate's orientation. This is slight for the 6-propionate, but for the 7-propionate, there is a definite change from an "out-ofheme-plane" conformation to a more extended "in-hemeplane" orientation, as shown in Figure 9. In Ec DosH, there are no amino acids structurally analogous to Arg206 and His214 in Bj FixLH. In Bj FixLH, these two amino acids also help to shield the propionate edge of the heme from solvent exposure. As already pointed out, this means that the Ec DosH propionate heme edge is much more solvent-exposed. As shown in Figure 9, both heme propionates in Ec DosH adopt "out-of-plane" conformations in both ligation states. In Ec DosH-O2, only one water molecule lies within hydrogen-bonding distance of the 7-propionate, which is also bent away from the 6-propionate (Figure 9). This conformation allows the 7-propionate carboxyl terminus, O2A, to come within 3.04 Å of the Arg97-N . Taken together, this combination of orientation

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 10, 2004 2745 oxygen is not the ligand (deoxy). Thus, O2 dissociation from the heme, which is the signal initiating event, results in opening a cleft between the FG and HI turns and extending the separation further between the G and H strands. For this area to represent the signal transduction pathway requires that the phosphodiester catalytic domain of full-length Ec Dos must interact through these regions with the heme domain. Consequently, for Ec Dos, the signal is likely to be propagated from the ligand-binding site by initial dissociation of O2 through Met95/Arg97 rearrangements to immediate neighbors in the heme distal pocket, which displace the FG and HI turns. This proposed mechanism is somewhat different from that envisioned for FixL, similarly formulated from the FixLH structures, where distal heme pocket participation was minimized in favor of a proposal that combined heme flattening and propionate hydrogen bond rearrangements (vide supra; 12-14). Whereas the Ec DosH heme propionates experience hydrogen bonding differences between the two ligation states similar to those identified in Bj FixLH, to us these seem to be incidental to the dramatically larger heme distal pocket changes. Moreover, as shown in Figure 8 and described above, comparing the Bj FixLH oxy and deoxy structures reveals that there are only very slight O2-dependent differences in the FG and HI turns. As in Ec DosH, the early G strand is where the most significant structural change occurs, but in Bj FixLH, this is the only area in the PAS domain core exhibiting other than minor structural changes. It may be that signal propagation is different in FixLs and Ec Dos, perhaps because of the different catalytic domains. It may also be that crystal packing forces in Bj FixLH inhibit the true extent of O2-dependent conformational rearrangement when the deoxy monomer is generated in situ from the Bj FixLH-O2 crystal. Further work on these questions is in progress. ACKNOWLEDGMENT J.D.S. acknowledges Harold M.

The heme edge with the 6-propionate (D or III pyrrole) and 7-propionate (A or IV pyrrole) positions (labeled on the middle structure) face the viewer.

and separation distance indicate a moderately strong hydrogen bond between the 7-propionate and Arg97 (39), which could help stabilize Arg97 within the hydrophobic heme pocket, perhaps through charge neutralization. The 6-propionate hydrogen-bonds to Asn84 and a water molecule in Ec DosH-O2. When the O2 ligand is not present, the 7-propionate conformation changes so that its carboxylate group points toward the 6-propionate (Figure 9), and it hydrogen bonds to the Met95 peptide N-H as a consequence of the large polypeptide chain deformation accompanying Met95 heme ligation. The 7-propionate carboxylate O1A is separated from the Met95-Np by only 2.98 Å. Two water molecules are within hydrogen bond distance as well. The 6-propionate is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Asn84 (N), the peptide NH of Gly94, and a water molecule. There are no resolved water molecules in the Ec DosH heme pocket, in either ligation state, which is another difference with the FixLHs. Conformational Changes and Mechanism. As previously described, in Ec DosH large O2-dependent conformational changes are found in the FG turn and the G strand. These changes alone are large enough to serve as a conformational mechanism for initial signal transduction, but we also find significant changes in the HI turn (Figure 5). The two primary amino acids in this turn, Glu121 and Gly122, display substantial CR of 4.05 and 3.49 Å, respectively, between the two ligation states. In contrast, for the two Bj FixLH ligation states (Figure 8), only small differences in CR coordinates are found for the HI turn. CR is only 0.47 and 0.55 Å for Gly244 and Gly245, the two corresponding primary amino acids in the HI turn. If the initial signal is conveyed away from the heme-O2 site by conformational changes, then there are three localized but adjacent regions in Ec DosH that suggest the transduction pathway: FG and HI turns and G strand. The adjacent spatial localization of these three regions can be seen in Figure 5A,B. Also obvious in Figure 5A is that the FG and HI regions lie farther apart from each other when molecular
