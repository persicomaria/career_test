ABSTRACT: Small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-3 is a member of a growing family of ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls). So far, four isoforms of SUMO have been identified in humans. It is generally known that SUMO modification regulates protein localization and activity. Previous structure and function studies have been mainly focused on SUMO-1. The sequence of SUMO-3 is 46% identical with that of SUMO1; nevertheless, functional heterogeneity has been found between the two homologues. Here we report the solution structure of SUMO-3 C47S (residues 14-92) featuring the - -R- - -R- ubiquitin fold. Structural comparison shows that SUMO-3 C47S resembles ubiquitin more than SUMO-1. On the helixsheet interface, a strong hydrophobic interaction contributes to formation of the globular and compact fold. A Gly-Gly motif at the C-terminal tail, extending away from the core structure, is accessible to enzymes and substrates. In vivo, SUMO modification proceeds via a multistep pathway, and Ubc9 plays an indispensable role as the SUMO conjugating enzyme (E2) in this process. To develop a better understanding of SUMO-3 conjugation, the Ubc9 binding surface on SUMO-3 C47S has been detected by chemical shift perturbation using NMR spectroscopy. The binding site mainly resides on the hydrophilic side of the -sheet. Negatively charged and hydrophobic residues of this region are highly or moderately conserved among SUMO family members. Notably, the negatively charged surface of SUMO-3 C47S is highly complementary in its electrostatic potentials and hydrophobicity to the positively charged surface of Ubc9. This work indicates dissimilarities between SUMO-3 and SUMO-1 in tertiary structure and provides insight into the specific interactions of SUMO-3 with its modifying enzyme.

Protein sumoylation by small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) proteins is an important posttranslational regulatory modification in diverse cellular processes, including nuclear transport, gene expression, stress responses, cell cycle control, oncogenesis, and response to virus infection (1, 2). It has been proposed that SUMO conjugation may function antagonistically with respect to ubiquitin conjugation and/ or that SUMO conjugation may regulate the interaction of the target protein with other cellular components. In humans, four types of SUMOs, i.e., SUMO-1-4, have been identified (3, 4). All SUMO genes actually encode an inactive precursor bearing a short C-terminal peptide, which is cleaved off by SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) to produce the mature Gly-Gly C-terminus. The SUMO molecule is then adenylated and covalently linked to a SUMO-activating E1 enzyme. Subsequently, SUMO is transferred to the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme, Ubc9. Then the E3 ligases stimulate conjugation of SUMO to specific substrates through an

isopeptide bond formed between the C-terminal glycine residue of SUMO and a lysine residue in the substrate (5). This lysine is frequently found at a conserved KXE motif, where  is a hydrophobic amino acid residue and X is any residue (6). Importantly, sumoylation is a dynamic and reversible process. Genetic data from yeast have shown that SUMO deconjugation catalyzed by Ulp1 (a SUMO-specific protease) is required for cell cycle progression (7). Sequence alignment of SUMO-1-3 reveals that the sequences of SUMO-2 and -3 are 46-48% identical with that of SUMO-1 while SUMO-2 and -3 are closely related and are 97% identical in sequence, and it is reasonable to group SUMO-2 and -3 into a subfamily distinct from SUMO1. SUMO-4, associated with the pathogenesis of type I diabetes, is 87% homologous with SUMO-2 with respect to amino acid sequence (4). Some substrates can be modified equally well by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3; however, Ran GTPase activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) is predominantly modified by SUMO-1, and topoisomerase II is preferentially modified by SUMO-2/3 (8-10). It is likely that E3s mediate the differential conjugation of the SUMO isoforms. To date, the mechanisms that determine selective modification by specific SUMO isoforms are not known. In COS-7 cells, conjugation of SUMO-2/3 is strongly induced in response to various stresses but SUMO-1 conjugation is not; thus, one function of SUMO-2/3 may be to provide a reservoir of free SUMO for stress responses (8). Unlike SUMO-1, SUMO2-4 contain a KXE motif in their N-terminal extensions, which can serve as SUMO attachment sites, thereby allowing

Solution Structure and Binding Surface of SUMO-3 formation of poly-SUMO chains (11). This may be one of the molecular foundations for functional heterogeneity between SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3. Human Ubc9, composed of 158 amino acid residues, belongs to an E2 protein family. In contrast to multiple E2 enzymes identified in ubiquitylation, Ubc9 is the only known SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme. The crystal structure of human Ubc9 has been determined, and it possesses a considerably stronger electrostatic dipole (12). The threedimensional structure of human SUMO-1 was determined using homonuclear NMR1 and heteronuclear NMR. Though only 18% identical in sequence with ubiquitin, the overall structure is similar to that of ubiquitin (13-16). Despite the similar protein fold, the distribution of charged residues on the surface of SUMO-1 is very different from that of ubiquitin. The binding interfaces of the Ubc9 and SUMO-1 complex have been detected by chemical shift perturbation. It was shown that the binding site of SUMO-1 resides on the ubiquitin domain, and the binding site of Ubc9 is located on a structurally conserved region of E2 (17). Smt3 is the SUMO homologue in yeast. Its NMR structure and the crystal structure of the Smt3-Ulp1 complex have also been determined (18, 19). The structural comparison of Smt3 in free and Ulp1 complex forms indicates important structural changes of Smt3 in complex as a result of the proteinprotein interaction. Most previous studies have been focused on SUMO-1; now more attention shifts to other SUMO family members. In this paper, we report the solution structure of SUMO-3 C47S and study its binding to Ubc9 by chemical shift perturbation using NMR spectroscopy. This work indicates structure dissimilarities of SUMO-3 with its homologue, SUMO-1, and provides insight into the specific interactions of SUMO-3 C47S with its modifying enzyme, Ubc9. MATERIALS AND METHODS Choice of Sequence for the NMR Study. The full-length cDNA of SUMO-3 (103 amino acid residues) was cloned and expressed initially; however, unfortunately, the signalto-noise ratio of peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was seriously uneven, and the quality of CBCANH and CBCA(CO)NH spectra was not sufficiently good to complete the backbone assignment. Thus, we analyzed its secondary structures using various algorithms and sequence alignment, and less ordered structures were identified in both N- and C-terminal regions of SUMO-3. As is generally known, flexible terminal regions prove to be difficult to resolve in solution NMR analyses. On the basis of these predictions and the previous study, residues 14-92, a ubiqutin-like domain of SUMO-3, were chosen for the NMR study. In addition, the C47S mutation of SUMO-3 was introduced to prevent the molecular dimerization by removal of the intermolecular S-S bridge. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of SUMO-3 C47S. The DNA fragment encoding residues 14-92 of SUMO-3 was amplified from the human brain cDNA library (Clon1 Abbreviations: NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; 2D and 3D, two- and three-dimensional, respectively; HSQC, heteronuclear singlequantum correlation; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlated spectroscopy; rmsd, root-mean-square deviation.

The reaction product (250 bp) was purified and then cloned into the T-vector. The positive clones were identified by restriction digestion. Then the DNA fragment was ligated into the NdeI-XhoI-cleaved plasmid pET22b (Novagen). The recombinant vector was amplified in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Subsequently, the plasmidinserted SUMO-3 DNA fragment (encoding residues 1492) was extracted and used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis for C47S (TGC f AGC). Two internal primers, 5-CTGATGAAGGCCTACAGCGAGAGGCAGGGCTTGTC-3 and 5-GACAAGCCCTGCCTCTCGCTGTAGGCCTTCATCAG-3 (Sangon), were designed for it. The mutation of the gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Takara). Taq polymerase, Ex Taq polymerase, T-vector, DNA ligase, and the relevant restriction enzymes were obtained from Takara. The mutated plasmid was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression. Recombinant SUMO-3 C47S has 88 amino acid residues, including a C-terminal His tag (LEHHHHHH). Uniformly labeled recombinant SUMO-3 C47S was produced using minimal medium containing 0.5 g/L [15N]ammonium sulfate (99%) and 2.5 g/L [13C]glucose (99%) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. SUMO-3 C47S was purified using a Ni-chelating column (Qiagen) and then Sephadex G-50 gel filtration (Pharmacia). Expression and Purification of Ubc9. The expression plasmid (pGEX-Ubc9) was transformed into E. coli DH5R cells. Expression was induced once the optical absorption at 600 nm (A600) reached 0.7 via addition of 0.8 mM IPTG for 6 h. Cells were lysed with a sonifier, and a 100000g supernatant was used for protein purification. The fusion protein was purified on a GSH-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's specification. The GST-Ubc9 fusion protein was digested with 50 units/ mL thrombin and then purified on a Sephadex G-50 column (Pharmacia). Purity Identification and Concentration Measurement. The purities of SUMO-3 C47S and Ubc9 were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the concentrations were measured with BCA kits (Pierce). The concentrations of 15N-labeled and 13 C- and 15N-labeled SUMO-3 C47S were 0.6-0.8 mM, while the concentration of unlabeled Ubc9 was up to 1.3 mM. All the samples for NMR contained 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.25), 75 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA in a 90% H2O/10% D2O mixture. NMR Spectroscopy and Data Processing. The NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX500 spectrometer with self-shielded z-axis gradients. The following spectra were recorded at 298 K to obtain backbone and side chain resonance assignments: 2D 1H-15N HSQC (20), 2D 1 H-13C HSQC (20), 3D triple-resonance spectra HNCO (21), HN(CA)CO (22), CBCA(CO)NH (23), CBCANH (24), C(CO)NH-TOCSY (25), H(CCO)NH-TOCSY (25), 15N TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY (26), HCCH-COSY (27), HBHA(CBCACO)NH (28), and 2D CB(CC)HD-COSY (aromatics) (29). 3D 15N-separated and 13C-separated NOESY (30) were

2792 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 8, 2005 acquired with mixing time of 100 and 130 ms, respectively. The 15N-labeled sample was lyophilized and dissolved in 99.96% D2O which was followed immediately with HSQC experiments for monitoring the disappearance of NH signals at 292 K. After all of the peaks had vanished, 2D homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY spectra were recorded on this sample at 298 K, which exhibited proton resonance from aromatic rings exclusively in the region beyond 6.0 ppm. NMR data processing was carried out using NMRPipe and NMRDraw software, and the data were analyzed with PIPP. All software was run on a Linux system. Linear prediction (31) was used to improve the spectral resolution in the indirect dimensions where constant-time acquisition was used, for example, the 15N evolution dimension in all the triple-resonance experiments mentioned above. Experimental Restraints and NMR Structure Calculation. NMR distance restraints were collected from three different NOESY spectra: 3D 15N-separated NOESY in water for amide protons, 3D 13C-separated NOESY in water for aliphatic protons, and 2D 1H NOESY in D2O (mixing time of 100 ms) for aromatic protons. NOE restraints were grouped into four distance ranges: strong, 1.8-3.0 and 1.83.5 Å; medium, 1.8-4.0 and 1.8-4.5 Å; weak, 1.8-5.0 Å; and very weak, 1.8-6.0 Å. Considering that the spin diffusion effect could be serious for aliphatic and aromatic protons, a more conservative distance estimation was used for the latter two NOESY spectra; therefore, most mediumrange and long-range NOEs from these two spectra were put into the weak or very weak groups, while most intraresidue NOEs were not used. The 1.8 Å lower limits were imposed only implicitly by the van der Waals repulsion force. For methyl protons, non-stereospecifically assigned methylene protons, and aromatic ring protons, r-6 summation averages were applied (32). The chemical shift index (CSI) (33) was calculated for four types of nuclei: CR, C , C, and HR. The derived secondary structures based on the consensus CSI were converted into restraints on and  angles. For R-helix residues, was limited to -60 ( 40° while  was limited to -50 ( 50°; for -strand residues, was limited to -120 ( 40° while  was limited to 130 ( 50°. Hydrogen bond restraints were employed in areas of regular secondary structures, displaying characteristic NOE cross-peaks. Each deduced hydrogen bond was represented by two distance constraints: R-helix residues, 1.6-2.4 Å for HN,,,O bonds and 2.4-3.3 Å for N,,,O bonds; and -strand residues, 1.42.7 Å for HN,,,O bonds and 2.4-3.7 Å for N,,,O bonds. Structures were calculated using CNS version 1.1 (34), employing a simulated annealing protocol for torsion angle dynamics (35). For the initial rounds of structure calculations, only sequential, intraresidual, medium-range NOEs, unambiguous long-range NOEs, and dihedral angle restraints were used. Later, all other long-range NOEs and hydrogen bonds were introduced in consecutive steps. Simple impulsion nonbonded interactions were used during structure calculation. Chemical Shift Perturbation. To detect the Ubc9 binding site on SUMO-3 C47S, 0.4 mM 15N-labeled SUMO-3 C47S was used. After the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of free SUMO-3 C47S was recorded, the sample was titrated with 1.3 mM unlabeled Ubc9. The final concentrations of both proteins at the end of the titration were approximately 0.3

Ding et al. mM. The HSQC spectra for obtaining the Ubc9 binding surface on SUMO-3 C47S were recorded at 298 K, which was used for the resonance assignments of SUMO-3 C47S. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Resonance Assignment. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of SUMO-3 C47S illustrates good dispersion of the proton and nitrogen resonances in the amide groups. In this spectrum, 77 expected correlation peaks for the backbone amide resonances were assigned, excluding N14 (N14 is the second residue of the truncated protein, and its residue number is the same as that in SUMO-3). The backbone assignments of SUMO-3 C47S were made primarily on the basis of CBCANH and CBCA(CO)NH spectra, with the use of HNCO and HN(CA)CO spectra to resolve ambiguities. C(CO)NH TOCSY and H(CCO)NH TOCSY were used to obtain side chain 13C and 1H chemical shifts, respectively. HCCH-TOCSY and HCCH-COSY were then used to resolve the ambiguities inside side chains; some side chain resonances missed in C(CO)NH or H(CCO)NH were also found and assigned. The water peak did not interfere with these two spectra seriously since most HR chemical shifts were <4.50 or >4.90 ppm. Some aromatic ring proton chemical shifts were assigned by correlating H to C in CB(CC)HD-COSY spectra, as well as 2D TOCSY spectra in D2O; the others were assigned through NOEs between ring protons and the intraresidue H and HN atoms. In total, 95% of the side chain resonances were assigned. Secondary Structures. Figure 1 shows the NOE pattern of short- and medium-range NOEs defining the secondary structure. The region from L39 to Q50 shows NOE patterns typical for an R-helical conformation. Six slowly exchanging NH protons (M43, A45, Y46, S47, E48, and R49) were found within this region, indicating that protection occurs most likely due to formation of hydrogen bonds here. In addition, a few helix-typical NOEs were found in the region from P72 to E76. Two slowly exchanging NH protons (L75 and E76) further indicate the second R-helix at this position. In contrast, helix R2 is not completely detected when the CSI method is applied. Characteristic long-range backbone NOE connectivities (i - j > 4) were used to define -strands. On the basis of this standard, five -strands [residues 17-23 ( 1), 27-33 ( 2), 58-61 ( 3), 64-66 ( 4), and 80-86 ( 5)] were identified with 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 3 and 5 being antiparallel and 1 and 5 being parallel. These secondary structural elements were additionally traced by 18 slowly exchanging NH protons. Some isolated dRN(i, i + 2) and/or dNN(i, i + 2) NOE contacts indicate the presence of -turns (residues 23-26, 34-37, 53-56, and 61-64). The location and extent of the secondary structural elements were further confirmed by CSI. Generally speaking, the secondary structural elements identified by this approach are mainly in agreement with those found by NOEs. A CSI plot for the resonances of SUMO-3 C47S is also shown in Figure 1. Quality of the SUMO-3 C47S Structure. The SUMO-3 C47S structure was calculated using CNS version 1.1 (34). A total of 1406 interproton restraints, including 360 intraresidue, 395 sequential, 225 medium-range, and 426 longrange, together with 78 backbone dihedral angle constraints and 28 hydrogen bond constraints were used in the final

round of the structural calculation. Being unassigned, the first residue (M13) and the C-terminal His tag had no NMR restraints, and they were excluded from structure calculation. Thus, on average, every amino acid residue is characterized by 18 contacts with its neighbors. Distributions of restraints by range and by sequence position are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2A, respectively. At the final stage, 200 conformers were calculated; of these, 20 conformers with the lowest energy were selected. All of them have no distance violations larger than 0.5 Å and no angle violations of more than 5°. In the 20 selected structures, 74.3% of the residues were in the most favored region on the Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK (36), 24.4% in the additionally allowed region, 1.0% in the generously allowed region, and 0.2% in the disallowed region. For the well-defined region of SUMO-3 C47S (residues 17-86), the values of the rmsd from the mean structure were 0.54 Å for backbone atoms and 1.11 Å for all heavy atoms.

Outside of this region, from residue H16 to the N-terminus and from residue F86 to the C-terminus, there is a gradually increasing level of disorder (Figure 2B). The backbone superimposition of the final 20 structures is shown in Figure 3A; toward the end of 5, the structure was less rigid, which is evident in Figure 2. Structure Description. The tertiary structure of SUMO-3 C47S consists of two R-helices and a mixed -sheet. The -sheet is composed of three antiparallel -strands and one parallel -strand (Figure 3B). Overall, the fold of SUMO-3 C47S is highly similar to those of ubiquitin and SUMO-1; helix R1 (residues 39-50) is rotated approximately 45° relative to the first two -strands ( 1 and 2), and this arrangement represents the typical ubiquitin-like conformation. Like SUMO-1, helix R1 is strongly amphipathic in nature, with hydrophobic residues pointing inward and hydrophilic residues pointing into the solvent. Relevant contacts at the helix-sheet interface in SUMO-3 C4S occur between hydrophobic side chains of L19, V21, V29, F31, F59, and I83 of the -strands and L39, L42, Y46, and Q50 of helix R1. Sequence alignment of SUMO-3 C47S with its family members and ubiquitin shows that, excluding Q50, these hydrophobic residues are highly conserved (Figure 4A) and appear to be essential for formation of the hydrophobic core. They, together with other conservative residues, I17, I33, F61, I66, L75, and V85, contribute to the maintenance of the ubiquitin fold of SUMO-3 C47S. Helix R2 of SUMO-3 C47S consists of approximately five residues. Long-range NOEs were observed from the N-terminal residues P38 and L39 of helix R1 to residue Q74 of helix R2 and the preceding residues, D70 and T71, making both helices into a conformation perpendicular to each other, which is also a typical ubiquitin fold. Taken together, the structure of SUMO-3 C47S is globular and very compact, except for the last six residues at the carboxyl terminus, which extend away from the core structure and are thus easily accessible to enzymes and substrates. It has been known that, to produce mature SUMO-3 (residues 1-92), 11 amino acid residues at the C-terminus of the SUMO-3 precursor were removed by the SUMOspecific protease, suggesting that the C-terminal region (residues 93-103) is not essential for the cellular function

of SUMO-3. A more reasonable explanation might be that the C-terminus, cooperatively with its preceding sequences, provides a bracket for protease to bind and cut. Data from yeast have revealed that the flexible N-terminal extension of SUMO can be entirely deleted and the ubiquitin-like domain is sufficient for conjugation to many substrates and for any downstream interactions required for yeast viability (37). There is also evidence that the 21 N-terminal amino acid residues of SUMO-1 are not involved in interaction with

E2 enzyme (17). The structural integrity of the mutant protein was evaluated by 1H NMR spectra. A high degree of similarity was found between the 1H NMR spectra of the native SUMO-3 and its mutant. This indicates that the C47S amino acid substitution does not alter the 3D structure of SUMO-3, so this truncated protein with the C47S mutation can be used to substitute SUMO-3 and elucidate the interaction of SUMO-3 with its enzymes. Moreover, because the sequence of SUMO-3 C47S is highly identical (>85%)

with those of SUMO-2 and -4, this structure can also represent the solution structure of SUMO-2 and -4. Structure Comparison with SUMO-1 and Ubiquitin. It is interesting to find that SUMO-3 C47S overall is more structurally similar to ubiquitin than SUMO-1. The backbone rmsd values between the average minimized structure of SUMO-3 C47S and the structure of SUMO-1 (PDB entry 1A5R) as well as that of ubiquitin (PDB entry 1D3Z) were calculated with the combinatorial extension (CE) method (39). SUMO-3 C47S is 46% identical in sequence with SUMO-1 and 14% identical in sequence with ubiquitin; on the other hand, the backbone rmsd value for the core structure of SUMO-3 C47S (residues 16-88) and ubiquitin (residues 1-72) is only 1.4 Å, but the rmsd value for the two core structures of SUMO-3 C47S and SUMO-1 (residues 2193) is 2.2 Å (Figure 4B). To further understand the reason, we have calculated the CR rmsd values for each residue when the core secondary structures of SUMO-3 C47S and SUMO-1 are aligned. Five regions, including two coils (residues 51-57 and 68-71), a turn (residues 61-64), helix R2 (residues 72-75), and the C-terminus of strand 5 (residues 87 and 88), of SUMO-3 C47S show a greater deviation (>2.0 Å) from the corresponding regions of SUMO-1 (Figure 5A), and coincidently, many residues here are not conserved (Figure 4A). A likely reason is that these regions, extending away from the hydrophobic core, are exposed to solvents. In contrast with SUMO-1, when the core secondary structure of SUMO-3

C47S is aligned with the ubiquitin structure, only two regions, i.e., a coil (residues 67-70) and helix R2 (residues 72-78) have rmsd values larger than 2.0 Å (Figure 5B). Although a 310-helix (residues 38-40) of ubiqintin is not found in SUMO-3 C47S, the CR rmsd values here are less than 2.0 Å. Collectively, the core structure of SUMO-3 C47S is superimposed well on that of ubiqutin and the overall structure of Ubls is highly conserved.

Ding et al. shift changes of these residues are linear with the addition of Ubc9. These residues are colored cyan in Figure 8A. In addition, residues K20, V21, G26, V28, T37, L39, S40, L42, R60, T69, E76, E78, D81, and Q88 have combined chemical shift changes larger than the mean value and are colored gray. The resonance of R49 overlaps with that of Q74; therefore, they cannot be monitored. Moreover, the crosspeaks of both protons of the side chain NH2 atom of Q24 shifted significantly, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds with certain residues of Ubc9. The two changes in side chain were not found in the SUMO-1-Ubc9 interaction (17). Ubc9 Binding Surface on SUMO-3 C47S. The information from chemical shift perturbation given above was used to map the Ubc-9 binding surface on SUMO-3 C47S. Residues 22-25, 57-67, 77, and 80-87 experience the most significant changes in line widths and chemical shifts upon complex formation with Ubc-9 (Figure 8A). All these regions are clustered together spatially, and thus constitute the surface binding to Ubc9. These residues are located in -strands 1 and 3-5, the C-terminus of helix R2, the loop between 1 and 2, and the sequence between 3 and 4. Fifteen of the perturbed residues are conserved in SUMO family members. Among the surface residues that are affected by complex formation, three negatively charged residues, E78, D81, and D84, are highly conserved, but in ubiquitin, they are substituted with neutral or positively charged residues (Figure 4A). In addition, D25 and D62 are moderately conserved among SUMO family members. These residues and other electronegative residues, E76, D79, and E80, constitute a large negative potential surface (Figure 8B). The observation suggests an important role for electrostatic attractions in the interaction between SUMO-3 C47S and Ubc9. Seven hydrophobic residues, i.e., I57, F59, F61, I66, M77, I83, and V85, on the binding surface are highly conserved throughout different species (Figure 4A). In particular, F61 and M77 are exposed to solvent, which may form hydrophobic interactions with Ubc9. On the contrary, many positively charged residues, including K32, K34, R35, H36, K41, K44, R49, and R55, are located on the other semiglobular surface, which is a distinct positive potential surface (Figure 8C) and does not interact with Ubc9.

FIGURE 6: Superposition of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled human SUMO-3 C47S, free and in complex with Ubc9. The SUMO-3 C47S/Ubc9 ratio is approximately 1:1. The cross-peaks of free SUMO-3 C47S are shown in blue, and those of SUMO-3 C47S in complex are shown in red. All backbone NH and side chain peaks affected by the complex formation are labeled.

Chemical Shift Perturbation upon Ubc9 Binding. Specific chemical shift perturbations and changes in the line widths were observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of SUMO-3 C47S upon formation of the complex with Ubc9. These changes were observed from the beginning of the titration, when the concentration of SUMO-3 C47S was approximately 0.4 mM and that of Ubc9 was 0.04 mM, until the final concentrations of SUMO-3 C47S and Ubc9 reached approximately 0.3 mM. Superposition of the HSQC spectra of free SUMO-3 C47S and that in complex with Ubc9 is shown in Figure 6. The line widths of residues G23, D25, F59, F61, D62, I66, E80, T82, I83, D84, V85, and F86 became so broad in the complex that their cross-peaks cannot be observed from the beginning of the titration when the SUMO-3 C47S/Ubc9 ratio is 10. These residues are likely in intermediate exchange and colored blue in the ribbon diagram of the SUMO-3 C47S structure (Figure 8A). Residues A22, Q24, I57, R58, G63, N67, M77, and Q87 exhibited combined chemical shift changes of more than the mean value plus one standard deviation (Figure 7). Most of these residues have large chemical shift changes in both the proton and nitrogen dimensions (Figure 6). The chemical

The combined 1H and 15N chemical shift changes are defined as ppm ) (HN)2 + (NRN)2, and the scaling factor RN used to normalize the 1H and 15N chemical shift is 0.17. Residues whose cross-peaks are not observed in the presence of Ubc9 are excluded.

Solution Structure and Binding Surface of SUMO-3

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 8, 2005 2797 charged residues and hydrophobic residues at the binding interfaces are conserved. This suggests the high compatibility of the binding interfaces. Thus, we can draw a conclusion that the Ubc9 binding surface on SUMO-3 C47S is located on the hydrophilic side of the -sheet, and complementary surface electrostatic potential plus hydrophobic interactions contributes to the specific binding of SUMO-3 C47S to Ubc9. A previous perturbation study has shown that the Ubc9 binding site on SUMO-1 consists of residues 26, 64-71, and 81-91 (17). Like SUMO-3 C47S, this surface bears negative charge, thereby interacting with the positively charged region of Ubc9. As a whole, the binding interface is conserved in SUMO-E2 interactions. In addition, SUMO-3 C47S shows a few specific residues perturbed upon formation of the SUMO-3-Ubc9 complex, which may result from the sequence and structure differences between the two isoforms. Mechanism of SUMO Distinguishing Ubc9 from Ubiquitin E2s. To our knowledge, SUMO has a single E2-typeconjugating enzyme, Ubc9, which is specific for SUMO and does not act on ubiquitin (43, 44). Although the threedimensional structures are highly conserved between SUMO-3 C47S and ubiquitin, the surface electrostatic potentials between the two proteins are very different. The surface of SUMO-3 C47S that binds Ubc9 has an overall negative electrostatic potential. However, this surface of ubiquitin is positively charged (13). A structural comparison of Ubc9 with ubiquitin-specific E2 enzymes (Ubc4 and Ubc7) revealed that, despite an overall similarity, the surface electrostatic potentials were quite different (45). The surface of Ubc9, which is involved in SUMO binding, is mainly positively charged, whereas the corresponding regions in ubiquitin-specific E2s have negative or neutral potentials. These differences are likely to have a role in modifier discrimination. Notably, the negatively charged surface of SUMO is highly complementary in its electrostatic potentials to the positively charged surface of Ubc9. On the basis of a similar reason, ubiquitin interacts with Ubc4 and Ubc7 but cannot bind to Ubc9. Despite a surprising similarity in modification mechanism, sumoylation and ubiquitylation have their own enzymes, independent pathway, and distinct functions. CONCLUSIONS We have determined the solution structure of SUMO-3 C47S which is the second NMR structure of human SUMO family members. Comparably, SUMO-3 C47S is more structurally similar with ubiquitin rather than SUMO-1. The hydrophobic residues at the helix-sheet interface are highly conserved, and they contribute to the maintenance of the globular and compact ubiquitin fold. Two glycine residues at the C-terminus that are involved in the formation of an isopeptide bond with a target protein extend away from the core structure. At the same time, we have studied the interaction between SUMO-3 C47S and its E2 enzyme by chemical shift perturbation. Residues 22-25, 57-67, 77, and 80-87 exhibit the most significant changes in line widths and chemical shifts upon formation of the complex with Ubc9. All these residues are clustered together in the threedimensional structure of SUMO-3 C47S. Among the SUMO family members, the negatively charged and hydrophobic

Those residues whose cross-peaks disappeared in the titration are colored blue; the residues whose combined chemical shift changes were more than the mean value plus one standard deviation and above the mean value are colored cyan and gray, respectively. (B) Surface electrostatic potential of human SUMO-3 C47S. The orientation of the molecule in panel B is the same as that in panel A. Red corresponds to negative potentials, and the electronegative residues are marked. (C) Surface potential rotated 180° from panel B about a vertical axis in the plane of the paper. Blue corresponds to positive potentials, and the electropositive residues are marked. The charge topology was calculated and displayed using MOLMOL (38).

As reported previously, the SUMO-3 binding site on Ubc9 mainly resides on helices R1 and R2, -strands 1-3, and the loop between R1 and 1 (42). These regions that are clustered together in the three-dimensional structure of Ubc9 constitute the surface binding to SUMO-3. Five electropositive residues, i.e., K14, R17, K18, H20, and K110, exhibit significant perturbation upon SUMO-3 binding. These highly conserved residues, together with adjacent R13 and K30, constitute a large positive potential surface as shown in Figure 2B (17). This surface is apparently compatible with the negative potential surface of SUMO-3. Consistent with that, R13A/K14A and R17A/K18A mutations in Ubc9 disrupted the interaction with SUMO (42). Furthermore, six hydrophobic residues affected significantly are also conserved between the human and yeast proteins. In a word, for SUMO-3 C47S and Ubc9, similar numbers of oppositely

2798 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 8, 2005 residues in the binding surface are highly or moderately conserved. Apparently, complementary surface electrostatic potential and hydrophobic interactions contribute to SUMO-3 C47S-specific binding to Ubc9. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. Ronald T.
