plicated in Alzheimer's disease (Fig. 3B, cytoskeletal/neuronal cluster). Most of the other known genes in this cluster are implicated in neuronal pathfinding and cell adhesion, including E-cadherin, which encodes a protein associated with the presenilin complex (28), and Notch, which encodes a substrate of the presenilin complex (29, 30). The cluster of 21 genes is enriched for components and substrates of the presenilin complex. These data (24) provide an overview of gene expression profiles during Drosophila development. An unusually high proportion of the genes are developmentally regulated, but of 4028 genes analyzed, only 903 are previously named Drosophila genes with a known mutant phenotype, biochemical function, or protein homology. Fifty-one percent of the genes fall into 50 clusters with correlation coefficients greater than 0.80 (for an annotated hierarchical cluster, see fig. S7, green bars). Virtually all the clusters contain genes with known or predicted roles in development or physiology, and genes to which a biochemical or cellular function has been assigned by the GO project (12) [all genes in these clusters are listed in the online database ( 24)]. A large number of the clusters contain genes that are used together in specific developmental or biochemical processes. On the basis of their developmental expression patterns, we have tentatively assigned 53% of the genes to a developmental or biological functional category (for example, male germ line, female germ line, eye, muscle, early zygotic, biochemical complex, or cell biology function). In addition to providing functional annotation of the Drosophila genome, these studies are a step toward a complete description of the genetic networks that control development.

Structural Basis for Gluten Intolerance in Celiac Sprue

Celiac Sprue, a widely prevalent autoimmune disease of the small intestine, is induced in genetically susceptible individuals by exposure to dietary gluten. A 33-mer peptide was identified that has several characteristics suggesting it is the primary initiator of the inflammatory response to gluten in Celiac Sprue patients. In vitro and in vivo studies in rats and humans demonstrated that it is stable toward breakdown by all gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal brushborder membrane proteases. The peptide reacted with tissue transglutaminase, the major autoantigen in Celiac Sprue, with substantially greater selectivity than known natural substrates of this extracellular enzyme. It was a potent inducer of gut-derived human T cell lines from 14 of 14 Celiac Sprue patients. Homologs of this peptide were found in all food grains that are toxic to Celiac Sprue patients but are absent from all nontoxic food grains. The peptide could be detoxified in in vitro and in vivo assays by exposure to a bacterial prolyl endopeptidase, suggesting a strategy for oral peptidase supplement therapy for Celiac Sprue. Celiac Sprue (also known as Celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is an autoimmune disease of the small intestine caused by the ingestion of gluten proteins from widely prevalent food sources such as wheat, rye, and barley. In many human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 (or DQ8)­positive individuals, exposure of the small intestine to gluten in1 Department of Chemical Engineering, 2Department of Medicine, 3Department of Chemistry, and 4Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305­5025, USA. 5Institute of Immunology, Rikshospitalet, University of Oslo, N-0027 Oslo, Norway.

duces an inflammatory response, leading to destruction of the villous structure of the intestine (1­3). It commonly appears in early childhood, with severe symptoms including chronic diarrhea, abdominal distension, and failure to thrive. In many patients, symptoms may not develop until later in life, when the disease symptoms include fatigue, diarrhea, and weight loss due to malabsorption, anemia, and neurological symptoms. Celiac Sprue is a lifelong disease, and if untreated it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (4, 5). Despite its high prevalence in most population groups ( 1: 200) and serious manifestations, the only effective therapy is strict dietary abstinence from these food grains.

Although QLQPFPQPQLPY, WQIPEQSR, and other control peptides were nearly completely proteolyzed within 1 to 5 hours, the 33-mer peptide remained largely intact for at least 15 hours (Table 1). The proteolytic resistance of the 33-mer gliadin peptide, observed in vitro with BBM from rats and humans, was confirmed in vivo by a perfusion protocol in intact adult rats (22). Whereas 90% of QLQPFPQPQLPY was proteolyzed in the perfusion experiment, the 33-mer gliadin peptide was highly resistant to digestion (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the 33-mer peptide is very stable when it is exposed to the BBM of the mammalian upper small intestine.

rived gluten-specific T cells (8, 9, 14, 23). The specificity of tTGase for certain short antigenic peptides derived from gliadin is higher than its specificity toward its physiological target site in fibronectin (24, 25). The kinetics and regiospecificity of deamidation of the 33-mer -gliadin peptide were therefore measured. The kcat/KM (specificity) was higher than that reported for any peptide studied thus far (26). Analysis with LC-MS and MS revealed that, although the deamidation pattern of LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF was complex, mono-deamidated products at the underlined Gln residues accumulated with time. This is consistent with the observed regioselectivity of human tTGase (8, 24). Because preliminary results indicate that tTGase activity is associated with the BBM of intestinal enterocytes (18, 27), it is likely that dietary intake of even small quantities of wheat gluten will lead to the build-up of sufficient quantities of this 33-mer gliadin peptide in the intestinal lumen, which will be recognized and processed by tTGase. The centrality of this 33-mer in the pathogenesis of Celiac Sprue is highlighted by the observation that not only is the deamidated product an excellent substrate for tTGase, but it is a very potent stimulator [median effective concentration (EC50) 80 nM] of three different HLA DQ2­restricted T cell clones derived from intestinal biopsies of Celiac A

Sprue patients stimulated with gluten (28) (Fig. 3). Each clone has been shown to recognize a distinct epitope found in the 33-mer (PFPQPQLPY, PQPQLPYPQ, and PYPQPQLPY, respectively) (8, 17). Moreover, freshly prepared T cell lines from most Celiac Sprue biopsies are stimulated by one or more of these epitopes, suggesting collective immunodominance of these epitopes. Testing of randomly selected polyclonal T cell lines from 14 different Celiac Sprue patients (Table 2) revealed that each line was very sensitive to the deamidated 33-mer peptide 1 M). Therefore, we interpret the (EC50 combination of metabolic stability and multivalency of the 33-mer to endow it with exceptional toxic potency against the small intestinal mucosa. These findings vividly reinforce the pathological importance of recent observations that initiation of a T cell­mediated inflammatory response requires the multivalent engagement of T cell receptor­major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) by an antigenic peptide (29, 30). They also suggest how this multivalent peptide (or its selectively deamidated form), which is intrinsically inert toward digestive breakdown, might be used orally for vaccination, prevention, and/ or treatment of Celiac Sprue (31, 32). Sequence alignment searches using BLASTP in all nonredundant protein databases revealed several homologs (E value 0.001) of the 33-mer gliadin peptide. Food grain­ derived

homologs were only found in gliadins (from wheat), hordeins (from barley), and secalins (from rye), all of which are toxic cereals in the Celiac diet (6) (fig. S1). Nontoxic food grain proteins, such as avenins (in oats), rice, and maize, do not contain homologous sequences to the 33-mer gliadin. In contrast, a BLASTP search with the entire 2-gliadin sequence identified food grain protein homologs from both toxic and nontoxic proteins. On the basis of available information regarding the substrate specificities of gastric, pancreatic, and BBM proteases and peptidases (19), we predict that, although many gluten homologs of the 33-mer gliadin peptide contain proteolytic sites and are therefore likely to be digested over time, several sequences from wheat, rye, and barley can be expected to be comparably resistant to gastric and intestinal proteolysis as LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF (33). The primary sequence of the 33-mer gliadin peptide also had homologs among a few nongluten proteins. Among the strongest homologs were internal sequences from pertactin (a highly immunogenic protein from Bordetella pertussis) and a mammalian protein tyrosine phosphatase of unknown function. In both cases, available information suggested that this homology could have biological relevance. For example, the region of pertactin that is homologous to the 33-mer gliadin peptide is known to be part of the immuno-

REPORTS
dominant segment of the protein (34). In the case of the phosphatase homolog, the protein is known to undergo vesicular trafficking into the cytoplasmic Golgi (35). By analogy with the current understanding of how gliadin peptides are acquired by HLA-DQ2 via a tTGase-mediated pathway (3), we hypothesized that these Pro-Gln-rich segments of both pertactin and the phosphatase are likely to be high-affinity tTGase substrates. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized the corresponding peptides and measured the selectivity of tTGase for these. As predicted, both peptides were found to be good substrates of tTGase (36). Studies by Pastan and co-workers showed that tTGase plays a key role in receptor-mediated endocytosis of several biologically important proteins (37). Therefore, we therefore propose that the biological activities of both pertactin and the phosphatase depend on tTGase-mediated trafficking. Analogous to gliadin in Celiac Sprue, pertactin elicits a vigorous antibody response because it reacts with tTGase on the extracellular surface of antigen presenting cells to produce a long-lived intermediate that is internalized via endocytosis and presented to the immune system via the class II MHC­ mediated pathway. If this analogy holds, then, drawing upon the Celiac Sprue analogy, one could predict that tTGase-mediated endocytosis might be a highly effective mechanism for oral vaccination with the use of immunogenic peptide epitopes, as long as they are intrinsically resistant to the action of pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase. By flanking such epitopes with proteolytically stable high-affinity tTGase substrates [e.g., the sequence PQPQLPYPQPQLP from gliadin (21)], they could be protected from exposure to potent pancreatic and intestinal exopeptidases and would therefore have sufficiently long half-lives to permit efficient stimulation of the gut-associated lymphoid system. Secondary structural studies using circular dichroism spectroscopy on the 33mer gliadin peptide and its homologs from pertactin and the tyrosine phosphatase reveal that these peptides have strong type II polyproline helical character (fig. S2). In addition to reinforcing the proteolytic resistance of these peptides, the type II polyproline helical conformation is typical of peptides bound to class II MHC proteins and is likely to enhance their binding to these proteins (38, 39). The abundance and location of proline residues is a crucial factor contributing to the resistance of the 33-mer gliadin peptide to gastrointestinal breakdown. Therefore, we hypothesized that a prolyl endopeptidase could catalyze breakdown of this peptide, thereby diminishing its toxic effects. Preliminary in vitro studies with short gliadin peptides and the prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) from Flavobacterium meningosepticum supported this hypothesis (21). The ability of this PEP to cleave the 33-mer gliadin peptide was evaluated in vitro (Fig. 4A) and in vivo using the rat intestinal perfusion model (Fig. 4B). In the latter assay, the synergistic effect of PEP and BBM peptidases was evident. Moreover, the T cell stimulatory potential of PEPtreated peptide was shown to decrease rapidly (Fig. 4C). Given the preference of PEP for Pro-Xaa-Pro tripeptides (40) and the abundance of this motif in immunogenic peptides from gluten (41), these results highlight the potential of detoxifying gluten in Celiac Sprue patients by peptidase therapy.
