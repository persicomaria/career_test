Abstract: Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase) is a unique member of the pancreatic-like ribonuclease superfamily. This enzyme exists as two conformational isomers with distinctive biological properties. The structure of the major isomer is characterized by the swapping of the N-terminal segment (M M BS-RNase). In this article, the crystal structures of the ligand-free M M BS-RNase and its complex with 2 -deoxycitidylyl(3 ,5 )-2 -deoxyadenosine derived from isomorphous crystals have been refined. Interestingly, the comparison between this novel ligandfree form and the previously published sulfate-bound structure reveals significant differences. In particular, the ligand-free M M BS-RNase is closer to the structure of M M BS-RNase productive complexes than to the sulfate-bound form. These results reveal that M M BS-RNase presents a remarkable flexibility, despite the structural constraints of the interchain disulfide bridges and the

INTRODUCTION
In a three-dimensional (3D) domain swapping dimer,1­ 6 a structural element of one subunit replaces the identical element of the other subunit, and vice versa. Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase) deserves a special position among 3D domain swapping proteins. In fact, this enzyme,7,8 which is homologous (80% sequence identity) to bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A),9 exists as two conformational isomers10 ­12: a swapping dimer (M M)8 and a not interchanged dimer (M M).12 In both dimeric forms, the two identical subunits are linked by two consecutive disulfide bridges. The structural diversity of the two forms reflects in their biological activities. In fact, the M M dimer shows Michealian kinetics, whereas the swapping dimer is allosterically modulated10 and it is endowed with a wide range of peculiar biological functions.13-15 It is noteworthy that RNase A can form two different 3D domain swapping dimers,16 and that both present completely different quaternary structures compared to M M BS-RNase.17,18 The observation that several unrelated proteins present swapping domains led Eisenberg and coworkers to propose that this process could be associated with the evolutionary transition of monomeric proteins to oligomeric states.1 However, the correlation between swapping and oligomerization is not straightforward for BS-RNase. Several biochemical and evolutionary studies suggest that the dimerization of BS-RNase, which is ensured by two consecutive interchain disulfide bridges, is not related to the swapping phenomenon.19 Therefore, in this peculiar system, the occurrence of domain swapping is associated to the development of specific functional abilities.11,20 We have previously studied the crystal structures of M M BS-RNase8 and its complexes with dinucleotides.20,21 Comparing the sulfate-bound structure of M M BS-RNase (sb-BS)8 with its productive complex with uridylyl(2 ,5 )adenosine (BS-UpA),21 a small but significant conformational rearrangement of the two subunits of the enzyme has been observed. This variation of the quaternary structure was attributed to the binding event, although the possibility that

this finding could be influenced by the packing of the two different crystal forms was not excluded.21 Here, we report the structures of the ligand-free M M BS-RNase (lf-BS) (2.5 Å resolution) and its complex with 2 -deoxycitidylyl(3 ,5 )-2 -deoxyadenosine (BS-dCpdA) (2.1 Å resolution) derived from isomorphous crystals. Comparative analyses of these novel M M BS-RNase forms with previously reported structures of the enzyme provide evidence for the intrinsic flexibility of the protein. Furthermore, our results suggest that a population shift mechanism22­25 may occur in the M M BS-RNase ligand binding process.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallizations and Data Collections
BS-RNase extracted from bovine seminal plasma was purified as described.12 The dinucleotide 2 -deoxycitidylyl(3 ,5 )-2 -deoxyadenosine (dCpdA) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. Ligand-free M M BS-RNase (lf-BS) and its complex with dCpdA (BS-dCpdA) were crystallized as previously reported.24,25 Orthorombic crystals of lf-BS were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, using polyethylene glycol 4000 30% w/v as a precipitant, protein concentration 10 mg/mL, sodium acetate 0.1M, and Tris-HCl 0.1M at pH 8.5.26 Crystals of BS-dCpdA, isomorphous to those of lf-BS, were obtained by microbatch methods using ammonium sulfate 62­ 64% saturation, 2-methyl-2,4-pentandiol 8 ­10% v/v, protein concentration 10 mg/mL, and a dinucleotide­protein molar ratio of 8:1 at 20°C.27 Diffraction data for lf-BS and BS-dCpdA were collected at room temperature on a Dip 2030 imaging plate detector (Nonius), mounted on a rotating anode source at 40 kV and 90 mA (CuK ). All data were processed using Denzo and Scalepack.28 Data collection statistics are given in Table I.

Structure Solution and Refinement
lf-BS and BS-dCpdA structures were solved with the molecular replacement method using the program X-PLOR29 and the native M M BS-RNase (sb-BS) as the search model (PDB code 1BSR). The structures were refined using a similar protocol: each refinement step was followed by manual interventions using the program O30 to correct mi-

nor errors in the positions of some side chains. Visual inspections were also performed to identify water molecule sites and to locate the dinucleotide molecules in the complex. The geometry of the refined structures was monitored using PROCHECK31 and WHATCHECK.32 The final lf-BS model presents an R factor of 0.185 (Rfree 0.255), whereas BS-dCpdA shows an R factor of 0.190 (Rfree 0.242). Statistics and parameters of the refinement are given in Table I. The coordinates of the two structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Identification codes are 1R5C and 1R5D for BS-dCpdA and lf-BS, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of Ligand-Free M M BS-RNase (lf-BS)
The crystal structure of ligand-free M M BS-RNase (lf-BS) has been derived from orthorhombic crystals grown using polyethylene glycol 4000 as a precipitant (Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5).26 Although these crystals were grown using the equilibrium mixture of M M and M M BS-RNase, the electron density corresponding to the hinge peptide regions clearly indicates that only the swapping form is detectable in the crystal state. The final model for lf-BS, refined using data

up to 2.5 Å resolution, presents an R factor of 0.185 (R free 0.255). The lf-BS structure presents a number of differences from the previously published sb-BS, derived from crystals grown in highly concentrated (80% v/v) ammonium sulfate solutions.8 Due to the high pH of the crystallization trials, no sulphate ions was identified in the active sites of the enzyme. In these regions, well-defined water molecules (Figure 1a) are located in positions similar to those found for ligand-free structures of pancreatic-like RNases.33­36 As reported for RNase A,37­39 the orientation of His 119 side chain is correlated to the absence/presence of the sulfate anion. In sb-BS,8 this catalytically important residue adopts two different conformations, called A and B (approximately 1 150° and 1 60°, respectively).40,41 On the contrary, in lf-BS the absence of the sulfate anion favors the A conformation in both subunits. Major differences are also observed in the external loop 65­72. In contrast to sb-BS,8 this loop adopts the same conformation in the two subunits. This conformation is similar to that found in RNase A,34 in the monomeric derivative of BS-RNase,42 and in the complex of M M BS-RNase with uridylyl(2 ,5 )adenosine (BSUpA).21 This observation corroborates the hypothesis

Active Site of BS-dCpdA
The structure of M M BS-RNase in complex with dCpdA was derived from crystals, which although grown in different conditions (see Methods for details) are isomorphous with those of lf-BS. The BSdCpdA structure was refined at 2.1 Å resolution and presents an R factor of 0.190 (R free 0.242). The inspection of the electron density map of the active site regions shows that the inhibitor is bound to the enzyme in the productive way (Figure 1b). However, the electron density of the dCpdA molecule is clearly defined only for the two bases and for the phosphate. In contrast to the BS-UpA complex, in which the electron density was very well defined for the whole dinucleotide,21 the electron density for the ribose groups of dCpdA is rather poor. However, in the former,21 direct hydrogen bonds between riboses of symmetry-related molecules probably contributed to the rigidity of these groups. The interactions between M M BS-RNase and dCpdA bases are very similar to those observed for the complex of RNase A with the same dinucleotide.41,43 In particular, O2 and N3 atoms of the base form strong hydrogen bonds with N and O 1 atoms of Thr45, respectively. The phosphate group is linked to the side chains of residues Gln11 and His 12 of one subunit and to the side chains of residues Lys41, His119, and to the N atom of Phe 120 of the other. Finally, the N1 and N6 atoms of the adenine are hydrogen bonded to the side chain atoms N 2 and O 1of the Asn71, respectively. Interestingly, stacking interactions between aromatic groups are also observed in the active site of BS-dCpdA. Specifically, the purine base interacts with His119 and with another purine base of a dCpdA bound to a symmetry-related molecule (Figure 2). Altogether these groups constitute an extended system of four aromatic groups involved in stacking interactions. The distances between these interacting aromatic groups is approximately 3.5 Å. In addition, as shown in Figure 2, the systems of Asn 71, Gln 69, and Asn 67 side chains are correctly oriented to interact with this system.

Detailed Comparison of Tertiary and Quaternary Structures of sb-BS, lf-BS, and BS-dCpdA
One of the most interesting features of lf-BS structure is the significantly different arrangement of the two subunits in the quaternary structure of the enzyme when compared to sb-BS (Figure 3). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the C atoms of lf-BS and sb-BS is 1.1 Å. This value is significantly

that the unusual conformation of the loop 65­72 in the second subunit of sb-BS is induced by the crystal packing forces.8 Differences between sb-BS and lf-BS were also observed for the overall quaternary structure of the enzyme (see below).

for the C atoms 0.2 Å) demonstrates that the quaternary structure remains virtually unaltered upon ligand binding (Table II). As far as the tertiary structures are concerned, according to previous approaches,21,38,44 ­ 46 the reorientation of the two -sheet arms of each subunit was estimated by calculating the angle formed by lines joining the centers of mass of the two arms (V1, formed by residues 61­ 63, 71-75, 105­111, 116 ­-124, and V2, formed by residues 42­ 46, 82­ 86, 96 ­101) and the center of mass of the hinge region connecting them. This angle reduces of about 1° when the sb-BS and lf-BS are compared to BS-dCpdA. Although these differences are particularly small, the observed trend is in line with previous results reported for M M BS-RNase,21 RNase A38,46 ­ 48 and other members of the pancreatic-like superfamily.48

Population Shift vs Induced Fit

Many efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the enzyme structural modifications induced by the ligand binding. Nowadays, the complex formation can be described according to two hypotheses, usually referred to as "induced fit" and "population shift."22­25 As stated in textbooks, the induced fit

higher than the expected errors in the coordinates of the two structures. In order to characterize the rearrangement of the subunits observed in the two structures, a stepwise superimposing procedure was carried out. In particular, when a single structural unit (residues 3­13 of the first subunit and residues 24 ­ 124 of the second subunit) of sb-BS is superimposed to lf-BS (Figure 3), the RMSD is 0.3 Å (Table II). At this stage, the RMSD of the other structural unit (residues 3­13 of the second subunit and residues 24 ­124 of the first subunit) is 3.5 Å. A rotation of about 8° is required to optimally overlay the second structural unit (Table II). This rotation reduces the RMSD from 3.5 to 0.3 Å. The two interchain disulfide bridges, formed by Cys31 of one subunit and Cys32 of the other and vice versa, act as a pivot of this rotation. This finding indicates that the quaternary structure of M M BS-RNase presents a remarkable flexibility despite the swapping of the N-terminal helices and the interchain constraints of the disulfide bridges. Although grown in different conditions,26,27 the crystals of BS-dCpdA and lf-BS are isomorphous. The availability of lf-BS and BS-dCpdA structures derived from isomorphous crystals allows us to single out the structural effects produced by ligand binding from those due to different packing contacts. The comparison between lf-BS and BS-dCpdA structures (RMSD

hypothesis suggests that the ligand binding produces ad hoc modifications in the host structure. In other words, the substrate binds to the enzyme, which undergoes a structural change that enhances the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate. The population shift mechanism describes the ligand binding process in terms of an equilibrium shift of preexisting conformations to one of the conformations that best fits incoming ligand. Recently, direct experimental evidences of the occurrence of a population shift mechanism have been provided for several response regulators.49 ­51 More recently, the existence of multiple conformational states, which are important for the biological function, has also been demonstrated for macromolecular complexes.52 The observed conformational variability of M M BS-RNase and its complexes with substrate analogs may provide a novel example of the occurrence of the population shift mechanism. By comparing sb-BS with BS-UpA, a conformational rearrangement of the two subunits of the enzyme has been observed.21 The conformational variation of the enzyme was previously attributed to the binding event. The novel structure of M M BS-RNase here reported shows that similar variations can also be observed by comparing different ligand-free structures of the enzyme. On the other hand, the known structures of productive complexes of M M BS-RNase (BS-UpA and BS-dCpdA) present similar quaternary structures. These observations indicate that the productive binding to M M BS-RNase may select one of the conformations accessible to the enzyme, according to the population shift mechanism.
