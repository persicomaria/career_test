Abstract Yersinia species pathogenic to human beneWt from a protein transport machinery, a type three secretion system (T3SS), which enables the bacteria to inject eVector proteins into host cells. Several of the transport substrates of the Yersinia T3SS, called Yops (Yersinia outer proteins), are assisted by speciWc chaperones (Syc for speciWc Yop chaperone) prior to transport. Yersinia enterocolitica SycD (LcrH in Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) is a chaperone dedicated to the assistance of the translocator proteins YopB and YopD, which are assumed to form a pore in the host cell membrane. In an attempt to make SycD amenable to structural investigations we recombinantly expressed SycD with a hexahistidine tag in Escherichia coli. Combining immobilized nickel aYnity chromatography and gel Wltration we obtained puriWed SycD with an exceptional yield of 120 mg per liter of culture and homogeneity above 95%. Analytical gel Wltration and cross-linking experiments revealed the formation of homodimers in solution. Secondary structure analysis based on circular dichroism suggests that SycD is mainly composed of -helical elements. To prove functionality of puriWed SycD previously suggested interactions of SycD with Yop secretion protein M2 (YscM2), and low calcium response protein V (LcrV), respectively, were reinvestigated. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Several Gram-negative pathogens such as Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Pseudomonas use a type three secretion system (T3SS)1 to deliver eVector proteins into host cells [1]. The proteins microinjected by pathogenic yersiniae (Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia pestis) are called Yops (Yersinia outer proteins). In the yersiniae cytosol, some of these Yops are accompanied by speciWc Yop chaperones, the Syc proteins [2]. The chaperones SycE, SycH, and SycT which serve the eVectors YopE, YopH, and YopT, respectively, are structurally characterized in detail [3­9]. These eVector chaperones are

grouped into class I of T3SS chaperones [10]. The members of this class all share a common fold despite low sequence similarity [11,12]. Yersinia SycD belongs to the phylogenetically distinct class II of T3SS chaperones [11,13]. The members of this class attend the translocators of the particular T3SS. These translocators are destined to form pores in the host cell membrane after their T3SS-dependent transport. In the bacterial cytosol their storage in a transport-competent state is mediated by class II chaperones [14]. SycD-like class II chaperones basically comprise of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs [13,15]. The TPR motif consists of two antiparallel -helices that mediate protein/ protein interactions [16]. Accordingly, the class II chaperones are predicted to adopt an all- -helical domain structure which diVers from the mixed - conformation of class I chaperones. However, up to now no high-resolution structure is available for a class II chaperone.

Beside its chaperone function SycD is involved in regulation of Yop expression. The SycD homologue of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis was termed LcrH to emphasize this regulatory function. The protein is critically involved in the so-called low calcium response associated with pathogenic Yersinia grown at 37 °C in the absence of extracellular calcium ions. Pathogenic yersiniae undergo growth restriction under these conditions and massively produce Yops which are secreted into the culture supernatant. Deletion of sycD/lcrH results in a temperature-sensitive phenotype characterized by growth restriction at 37 °C in the presence of calcium ions [17­19]. The complexity of the regulatory network in which SycD/LcrH is engaged is unknown, but the network involves at least YopD, SycH, YscY, YscM1/ LcrQ, and YscM2 (present only in Y. enterocolitica) [19­ 23]. A pioneering matrix analysis of protein/protein interactions elucidated several additional candidate members of this network [24]. Recently, we established the production of the network components SycH, YscM1, and YscM2 [25,26]. Here, we report the high-level recombinant production of Y. enterocolitica SycD in order to contribute to its structural and functional characterization. Materials and methods Cloning Yersinia enterocolitica sycD was ampliWed by PCR using primer 5 -CATATGCAACAAGAGACGACAGACACT C-3 to introduce an NdeI restriction site (underlined) and 5 -GCGGCCGCTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCG ATCCTCTTGGGTTATCAACGAACTCATGTTC-3 thereby introducing a NotI restriction site (underlined) as well as the sequence encoding a Arg-Gly-Ser-(His)6 epitope at the C-terminus. The pYV virulence plasmid of Y. enterocolitica WA-314 [27] was used as PCR template. The PCR product was subcloned into pMOSBlue (Amersham Biosciences), excised by restriction with NdeI and NotI and ligated into NdeI-NotI-cleaved vector pET-24b (Novagen) resulting in plasmid pET-SycD. Sequence Wdelity was checked by DNA sequencing. The sycD sequence proved to be identical to that from Y. enterocolitica A127/90 [28]. Expression and puriWcation Plasmid pET-SycD was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). A 100 ml overnight culture was grown in LB medium supplemented with 1% glucose at 37 °C and diluted 1:50 into LB medium the next day. A 5 L culture was further propagated in a BIOSTAT B fermenter (B. Braun Biotech International) at 37 °C under conditions of constant aeration (10 l/min), pH (7.2) and stirring (200 rpm). At an OD600 nm of 0.7 the temperature was decreased to 27 °C and subsequently SycD expression was induced by addition of 0.2 mM IPTG. Bacteria were further cultivated for approximately 18 h, harvested by centrifugation and frozen at ¡20 °C. Bacterial pellet from 1.1 L of culture was resus-

pended in 80 ml of BuVer A (40 mM phosphate pH 7.8, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) supplemented with 4 mM PMSF and 250 U Benzonase (Merck Biosciences). The sample was passed through a French press three times (1000 psi) and centrifuged at 20,000g for 40 min. The supernatant was loaded on a HisTrap HP 5 ml column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated to buVer A. The column was washed with buVer A until the baseline was stable. Subsequently, a gradient with buVer B (buVer A plus 0.5 M imidazole) was applied to reach 10% buVer B after 10 ml, the gradient was then stopped until the baseline was stable. Then, a 90 ml gradient was run to end with 100% of buVer B. SycD eluted at approximately 30% of buVer B. For the Wnal gel Wltration step a Superdex 75 (26/60) column was equilibrated to 10 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. The eluate was concentrated on membranes with a cut-oV of 10 kDa (Vivascience, polyethersulfone membrane). Preparative chromatography was conducted on an Äkta Explorer System (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant YscM2 was produced as previously described [25]. Expression and puriWcation of recombinant LcrV was basically performed as described by Roggenkamp et al. [29]. Following elution of LcrV from Ni-NTA column appropriate fractions were pooled and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 (26/60) column equilibrated to 10 mM Tris­HCl pH 8, 100 mM NaCl. Analytical gel Wltration chromatography Analytical gel Wltration was performed on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described [26] using a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Marker proteins for column calibration were purchased from Sigma (bovine serum albumine, 67 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa). Native gel electrophoresis Tris-based continuous native gel electrophoresis was modiWed after the protocol deposited by the lab of J.A. King (http://web.mit.edu/king-lab/www/cookbook/rngel.htm). The 8% native acrylamide gels were composed of 2.5 ml H2O, 1.5 ml 30% acrylamide/0.8% bisacrylamide, 1.5 ml 4£ native gel buVer (1.5 M Tris­HCl pH 8.9), 0.1 ml TEMED 10%, and 80 l of APS 10%. The 3£ sample buVer was composed of 3 ml glycerol, 0.6 ml of 50£ running buVer, 6.4 ml H2O and 0.005% bromophenol blue, the 50£ running buVer was 250 mM Tris base, 1.92 M glycine. Gels were pre-run for 30 min at a constant voltage of 80 V. Then samples were separated for 2­3 h at 80 V. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or were alternatively electro-blotted. Protein quantitation and mass balance Protein concentration of crude extracts was determined applying the Protein Assay from BIO-RAD Laboratories with BSA as a standard. PuriWed SycD was quantiWed in

6.0 M guanidine hydrochloride buVered with 0.02 M phosphate (pH 6.5) based on a calculated extinction coeYcient of 1.18 M¡1 cm¡1 assuming that all cysteins were reduced (Expasy ProtParam http://www.expasy.org/). For quantitation of Coomassie-stained gels the BIO-RAD Gel Doc EQ System was used for recording and Quantity One software was applied for analysis. DeWned amounts of puriWed SycD loaded on SDS­PAGE were used to quantify the content of SycD in crude lysates taking into account background subtraction of non-induced controls. Chemical cross-linking Cross-linking reagents EGS (ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate]) and DSP (dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate]) were purchased from Pierce. Cross-linking of SycD with EGS was performed as follows. 10 l reaction volume containing 1 mM EGS and 3.4 g/ l recombinant SycD in PBS was incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.4 l of a 1 M Tris­HCl pH 8.0 solution and incubated for another 15 min at 20 °C. Ten microliter of SDS­PAGE loading buVer containing 5% 2mercaptoethanol was added to 10 l of reaction volume and the sample was boiled for 5 min at 95 °C before loading. Cross-linking of SycD and YscM2 was conducted with DSP. Therefore, 10 l reaction volume containing 1.3 mM DSP, 3 g/ l SycD and 2 g/ l YscM2 in PBS was incubated for 30 min at 20 °C and attended as above except that SDS­PAGE loading buVer contained no reducing agent. Analogously, cross-linking of SycD with LcrV using DSP was performed. Circular dichroism spectroscopy Far-UV CD spectra of SycD (0.1 mg/ml) in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM potassium Xuoride pH 7.5 were recorded at 20 °C with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Großumstadt, Germany) equipped with a PTC343 peltier unit using a 1 mm quartz cuvette. 12 scans were averaged and corrected for the buVer signal. The molar ellipticity was calculated for the mean residue weight, MRW.

the encoded protein. The DNA fragment was inserted into vector pET-24b. The resulting plasmid pET-SycD was transformed into expression host E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. Though expression levels were comparable at either 37 °C or 27 °C we found that solubility of SycD was critically dependent on expression temperature. At 37 °C more than half of SycD was insoluble whereas at 27 °C almost all SycD was soluble. Culturing of induced bacteria overnight increased total yield signiWcantly and did not interfere with solubility or stability of SycD. Since we observed that insuYcient aeration decreased solubility we chose to cultivate the bacteria in a BIOSTAT fermenter to achieve conditions of oxygen saturation. Optimized, the yield of expressed SycD was about 210 mg per liter of culture (Table 1). After Ni sepharose chromatography the preparation was already homogeneous to more than 80% (Fig. 1). A Wnal size exclusion chromatography step removed residual contaminants. Finally, we obtained approximately 120 mg of pure SycD from 1 liter of bacterial culture (Table 1). We could concentrate the protein up to 30 g/ l. The proper folding of SycD was assessed by CD spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 2. The spectrum reveals that the protein consists primarily of -helices, in full agreement with secondary structure predictions and a homology-based structural model [13,15]. Recombinant SycD appears as a dimer T3SS class I chaperones typically form and act as homodimers. For class II chaperones such as SycD information

about possible oligomeric states is scarce. Therefore, we applied gel Wltration chromatography and chemical crosslinking to characterize SycD. A representative analytical gel Wltration analysis is depicted in Fig. 3A. Recombinant SycD was applied on a Supderdex 75 column together with marker proteins, 67, 29, and 12 kDa in size. The calculated molecular mass of our tagged SycD is 20.2 kDa. In these analyses the apparent molecular mass of SycD was 35­ 40 kDa suggesting dimer formation. To conWrm this Wnding chemical cross-linking of SycD was performed. Fig. 3B shows that upon incubation with the cross-linker EGS the major cross-linking product emerging was the SycD dimer accompanied by a subset of trimers and tetramers. Testing SycD functionality: interaction with recombinant YscM2 The T3SS translocators YopB and YopD which are chaperoned by SycD/LcrH are the obvious substrates to test binding activity of puriWed SycD. However, since YopB and YopD are destined to form pores in the host cell membrane they are poorly tractable for in vitro studies. Recently, Swietnicki et al. [24] were able to identify by surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry a novel interaction between LcrH of Y. pestis biovar Orientalis and Y. enterocolitica Yop secretion protein YscM2. Since YscM2 is not present in Y. pestis this Wnding suggests that Y. enterocolitica SycD--diVering in two amino acid positions from LcrH of Y. pestis biovar Orientalis--should also interact with YscM2. Using the chemical cross-linker DSP we were able to conWrm this interaction thereby proving that puriWed SycD was functionally active. The interaction between SycD and YscM2 is displayed in Fig. 4, where

Fig. 5. Native gel electrophoresis does not provide evidence for a SycD/ LcrV interaction. Coomassie-stained Tris-based native gel with loading of proteins as indicated. Amount of LcrV applied was kept constant at 10 g, amount of SycD was increased from 3 to 21 g in 3 g increments corresponding to an approximately 4 fold excess of SycD over LcrV at the end point; SycD control: 12 g. Polarity of gel as indicated.

This Wnding was later challenged by Fields et al. [33] and Sarker et al. [34] who could not conWrm an LcrV/LcrH or an LcrV/SycD interaction. Having both SycD and LcrV in hands we reinvestigated the LcrV/SycD interaction by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5) and chemical cross-linking (Fig. 6). While we were not able to detect an interaction between LcrV (39 kDa) and SycD (20.2 kDa) applying the native gel system, cross-linking resulted in appearance of additional bands, the most pronounced one (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 6A and B) probably representing a 1:1 complex of approximately 60 kDa. In conclusion, the existence of this interaction has still to be considered.

panel A represents a Coomassie-stained gel and panel B represents the Western blot of a duplicate experiment developed with antibodies that were raised against YscM2. The same SycD/YscM2 cross-linking product was detectable when antibodies raised against SycD were applied instead (data not shown). The SycD/YscM2 complexes Wxed by the cross-linker exhibit a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa which suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry between SycD (20.2 kDa) and YscM2 (12.9 kDa). This is remarkable since not only SycD but also YscM2 is capable of forming homodimers (lane 4 in Fig. 4A and B, [25]). However, this Wnding requires conWrmation by an alternative technique such as analytical gel Wltration to rule out bias of the method. Reinvestigation of a possible SycD/LcrV interaction LcrV, the likely extracellular chaperone of YopB and YopD [30,31], was described also to interact with LcrH [32].

Discussion SpeciWc chaperones are one of the hallmarks of type IIIdependent protein transport in Gram-negative bacteria. While class I T3SS chaperones proved to be readily amenable to crystallographic analysis, structural data for class II T3SS chaperones are lacking and information about the particular mode of action of these chaperones is limited. Here, we report the recombinant production of a representative of class II T3SS chaperones, Y. enterocolitica SycD. We obtained an exceptionally high yield of approximately 120 mg from one liter of bacterial culture. This yield was crucially dependent on cultivation at 27 °C instead of 37 °C to minimize inclusion body formation and on intensive aeration. PuriWcation of the SycD homologue LcrH from Y. pseudotuberculosis [35] and Y. pestis [24] in a His-tagged form has been previously reported. However, these studies include no information on yield and no documentation of quality, impeding their comparison. The high-level puriWcation of SycD now allows us to set up SycD crystallization trials and to biochemically characterize the protein in detail. CD spectroscopy revealed a folded protein with a predominantly -helical organization. This is in full agreement with the structural proposition published by Pallen et al. [13] and Edqvist et al. [15] and their assumption that chaperones of T3SS translocators form a class structurally distinct from class I chaperones which adopt a mixed - structure. Crystallographic studies established the view that class I chaperones typically act as homodimers which are used as spindles almost completely wrapped around by the chaperone-binding segment of their substrates [4,36]. Here, we could demonstrate that class II chaperone SycD also forms homodimers despite its putative structural divergence. Previously, for Salmonella typhimurium SicA [37] and Y. pseudotuberculosis LcrH [35] dimerization has also been suggested. Dimerization thus might be a shared feature of class I and class II T3SS chaperones important for recognition and downstream processing of the chaperone/substrate complexes. Class II chaperones are deeply involved in regulatory aVairs beside their assistance to translocators [10]. Information about protein/protein interactions potentially contributing to the network of T3SS regulation is ever increasing in general and in particular for LcrH/SycD. We focussed on reassessment of two previously suggested interactions of LcrH/SycD. One was the interaction of LcrH with LcrV reported by Motin et al. [32], which has already been challenged by two other groups [33,34]. Applying two alternative methods, native gel electrophoresis and chemical crosslinking, we found cross-linking to support the existence of LcrV/SycD complexes. By contrast, native gel analysis did not indicate an interaction. In conclusion, further attempts are required to clarify this open question. Swietnicki et al. have recently shown an interaction between Y. pestis LcrH and Y. enterocolitica YscM2 [24]. Since YscM2 is not present in Y. pestis this Wnding suggests

an interaction of SycD and YscM2 in Y. enterocolitica which we could conWrm. This result is of particular interest, because YscM2 is also known to interact with a class I chaperone, SycH [7,21,25]. It will be interesting to compare the modes of interaction of the substrate YscM2 upon binding to either chaperone. Possibly, despite the structural diVerences between class I and class II chaperones their mode of interaction with substrates is conserved.
