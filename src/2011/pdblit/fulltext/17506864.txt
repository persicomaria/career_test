Golgi-localizing, g-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP ribosylation factor-binding (GGA) proteins and the adaptor protein (AP) complex, AP-1, are involved in membrane traffic between the trans Golgi network and the endosomes. The g-adaptin ear (GAE) domain of GGAs and the g1 ear domain of AP-1 interact with an acidic phenylalanine motif found in accessory proteins. The GAE domain of GGA1 (GGA1-GAE) interacts with a WNSF-containing peptide derived from its own hinge region, although the peptide sequence deviates from the standard acidic phenylalanine motif. We report here the structure of GGA1-GAE in complex with the GGA1 hinge peptide, which revealed that the two aromatic side chains of the WNSF sequence fit into a hydrophobic groove formed by aliphatic portions of the side chains of conserved arginine and lysine residues of GGA1-GAE, in a similar manner to the interaction between GGA-GAEs and acidic phenylalanine sequences from the accessory proteins. Fluorescence quenching experiments indicate that the GGA1 hinge region binds to GGA1-GAE and competes with accessory proteins for binding. Taken together with the previous observation that g1 ear binds to the GGA1 hinge region, the interaction between the hinge region and the GAE domain underlies the autoregulation of GGA function in clathrin-mediated trafficking through competing with the accessory proteins and the AP-1 complex.

Clathrin-mediated traffic between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and the endosomes is regulated by Golgi-localizing, g-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP ribosylation factor (ARF)-binding (GGA) proteins and the adaptor protein (AP) complex, AP-1. While AP-1 is heterotetrameric, the GGA proteins (GGA1, 2 and 3) are a family of monomeric APs (1­5, for review, see 6­8). The GGA molecules are composed of three distinct domains and one flexible region (reviewed in 6­8): the N-terminal Vps27p/Hrs/STAM (VHS) domain, which recognizes the consensus acidiccluster dileucine motif found in lysosomal cargo receptors, such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) (9­12); the GGA and Tom1 (GAT) domain, which interacts with a GTP bound form of ARF on the TGN membrane (1,3, 13­15); the proline-rich hinge region, which interacts with clathrin (12,13,16) and the C-terminal g-adaptin ear (GAE) domain, which is homologous to the ear domain of the g1 subunit of the AP-1 complex (g1 ear) (1­5). GGA-GAEs and g1 ear interact with a number of accessory proteins, including g-synergin (2,5,17), epsinR (18­21), rabaptin-5 (2,22,23), p56 (24) and Ent3p and Ent5p (25). The PEEDDFQDFQDA sequence (bulky hydrophobic residues are underlined) derived from g-synergin and the TSGNGDFGDWSA sequence from epsinR are sufficient for binding g1 ear (20). Additionally, the DESDFGPLVGADS sequence of rabaptin-5 measurably binds GGA-GAEs and g1 ear (22). Furthermore, the phenylalanine residues in the DEEEDDDDEFSEFQ and DDDDDEFGDFQ sequences of Ent3p and Ent5p, respectively, are essential for their binding to the yeast Gga2p-GAE domain and g ear (25). Based upon these studies, the acidic phenylalanine motif [D/E][G/A](0-1)F[G/A][D/E]F (F is a bulky hydrophobic residue) was proposed as a consensus sequence for binding to GGA-GAEs and g1 ear (26). Crystal structures of GGA1GAE in complex with the p56 peptide and GGA3-GAE in complex with the rabaptin-5 peptide have been solved (27,28), and the conserved aromatic side chains of the p56 and rabaptin-5 peptides are stacked in a hydrophobic groove of GGA-GAEs partially comprised hydrophobic portions of conserved arginine and lysine side chains. Gamma1 ear interacts with the GGA hinge region as well as the accessory proteins, suggesting that AP-1 and GGAs cooperatively recruit cargoes to clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN (29). Recently, the WNSF sequence of the GGA1 hinge region was shown to be critical for binding to g1 ear

(30, Yamada et al., in preparation), despite deviation from the acidic phenylalanine motif consensus sequence (26) in two respects. First, the WNSF sequence contains no acidic amino acid residues adjacent to the two bulky hydrophobic residues. Additionally, the conserved phenylalanine is replaced with tryptophan. However, a WGDF sequence in an accessory protein, NECAP, was subsequently shown to specifically interact with g1 ear (30­32). We previously demonstrated that both the acidic phenylalanine sequence of g-synergin and the WNSF sequence of the GGA1 hinge bind to the same site of g1 ear (33, Yamada et al., in preparation). As GGA1-GAE is a structural and functional homologue of g1 ear, we also hypothesized and confirmed that the GAE domain of GGA1 interacts with the WNSF sequence of its own hinge region (33). Here, we report the crystal structure of GGA1-GAE in complex with the WNSF-containing peptide originating from the GGA1 hinge region. Additionally, binding of the hinge region precludes accessory protein binding, suggesting an autoregulatory mechanism for GGA1 in clathrinmediated membrane traffic.

Results and Discussion
Interaction between the GGA1-GAE and the GGA1 hinge region We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to examine the interaction between the GGA1-GAE and the WNSF sequence in the GGA1 hinge region. The WNSF-containing peptide (379GTGWNSFSQ387) from the GGA1 hinge region that was previously shown to bind to g1 ear was fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) (30, Yamada et al., in preparation). The GST-fused WNSF peptide was immobilized on a sensor chip and used to estimate the affinity of GGA1-GAE and g1 ear binding by SPR. Indeed, GGA1-GAE interacted with the WNSF peptide of its own GGA1 hinge region with a Kd value of 180 mM as we reported previously (33, Figure 1; Table 1); this value is comparable with that of g1 ear binding to the WNSF sequence (130 mM) (33). Two bulky hydrophobic residues, tryptophan and phenylalanine, of the WNSF peptide play crucial roles in mediating its interaction with g1 ear (30,33). To examine if the same residues are responsible for the interaction with GGA1GAE, we generated additional peptides in which these two residues were mutated to alanine, W382A or F385A. As shown in Figure 1, both mutations almost completely abolished the binding of the WNSF peptide to GGA1-GAE; for this reason, we were unable to estimate Kd values for the interaction of these mutant peptides with GGA1-GAE. Therefore, the two bulky hydrophobic residues of the WNSF sequence play central roles in mediating the interaction of this peptide with GGA1-GAE. Sequences derived from g-synergin (LADDFGEFSLFGE), epsinR (GNGDFGDWSAFNQ) (20) and rabaptin-5 (DESDFGPLVG) (22) were also fused to GST, and their binding to GAE was examined. These three sequences Traffic 2007; 8: 904­913

match or closely resemble the consensus sequence of the acidic phenylalanine motif, [D/E][G/A](0-1)F[G/A][D/E]F (26). The Kd values of GGA1-GAE binding to the g-synergin and the epsinR peptides were estimated to be 75 and 110 mM, respectively (Table 1), which are about one order of magnitude higher than those of g1 ear (data not shown). The higher Kd values (i.e., lower affinities) of GGA1-GAE for g-synergin and epsinR than that of g1 ear is consistent with results previously obtained using a pull-down experiment (19). Conversely, the rabaptin-5-derived peptide bound GGA1-GAE with Kd value of 69 mM (Table 1), which is comparable with that of g1 ear (data not shown) confirming previous data (22). Overall structure of GGA1-GAE in crystal and in solution To better understand the molecular mechanistic basis of the interaction of GGA1-GAE and the WNSF sequence, we undertook X-ray crystallographic analyses. First, we determined the crystal structure of the free form of GGA1-GAE

° at 2.3 A resolution by the molecular replacement method using the g1 ear structure (34) as a search model. Based on this structure, GGA1-GAE forms an immunoglobulin-like bsandwich fold composed of two b sheets (strands b1-b2b3-b5-b6 and b4-b7-b8) and one a-helix at the C-terminus (Figure 2A). The structures of the four molecules (A, B, C and D) in the asymmetric unit are essentially the same, with a maximum root mean square difference (rmsd) of ° 0.67 A for the corresponding Ca atoms of the eight b strands (residues 514­520, 522­530, 540­550, 552­564, 569­573, 591­599, 607­616 and 619­628). The obtained

GGA1-GAE structure is virtually identical to a previously reported structure belonging to a different space group ° (24) (PDB ID: 1NA8) with a rmsd of 0.88A. It is also similar ° to the g1 ear structure (34,35) with a rmsd of 1.34A for the Ca atoms of the eight b strands. In the crystal, the four GGA1-GAE molecules in the asymmetric unit exist as two dimers (molecules A­B and C­D), these dimeric structures can be superimposed on ° each other with rmsd less than 0.6 A for the Ca atoms of the eight b strands. Two dimers are formed by face-to-face interactions of the b sheets of two GGA1-GAE molecules related by a pseudo twofold axis (Figure 2A). Extensive interactions occur between the two molecules through the b sheet (composed of b1, b2, b3, b5 and b6) and two loops between b2 and b3 and between b5 and b6 (Figure 2A). The surface areas buried upon dimerization ° ° are 2873 A2 between molecules A and B, and 3158 A2 between molecules C and D. Both dimers have predominantly hydrophobic contact areas (Figure 2B), and dimerization seems to be mediated by hydrophobic interactions between the b sheets of the two GGA1-GAE molecules. We performed size exclusion chromatography to better estimate the oligomerization state of GGA1-GAE in solution, and GGA1-GAE eluted at a position corresponding to a dimer (data not shown). We also carried out small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments at protein concentrations ranging from 3.0 to 12.0 mg/mL. The molecular weight of GGA1-GAE was calculated to be 25 kDa from the Guinier plots, where the values of the zero-angle scattering intensities for GGA1-GAE and the standard protein were extrapolated from the Guinier regions (data not shown). This calculated molecular weight is 1.7 times larger than the estimated molecular weight of a GGA1-GAE monomer (14.7 kDa). Finally, the P(r) function derived from the scattering data was compared with those calculated from the monomer and dimer crystal structures. As shown in Figure 3, the peak position and the overall shape of the P(r) function from the dimer crystal structure coincided well with those obtained by the scattering experiment. Based on these observations, we conclude that GGA1-GAE forms a homodimer in solution. The previously reported structures of GGA1-GAE in a free form (PDB ID: 1NA8) and in complex with the p56 peptide (PDB ID: 1OM9) (24,27) show extensive interactions between two monomers with buried surface areas of ° ° 2651 A2 for 1NA8 and 2571 A2 for 1OM9. Although the interfaces between the two monomers in these crystal structures are composed of a concave surface of b sheets (b1, b2, b3 and b6 strands) and a long loop (b5-b6) like that of our crystal structure, the relative orientation of each monomer differs from our results. This difference likely arises from the different constructs used for crystallization. In the 1NA8 and 1OM9 structures, the N-terminal extension of GGA1-GAE, which is missing in our construct, is located at the dimer interface, and it interacts with the Traffic 2007; 8: 904­913

b2-b3 loop of its own molecule and the b5-b6 loop of the counterpart molecule. As the accessory-protein-binding sites (b4, b5 and b7) are located opposite the dimer interface, GGA1-GAE dimerization would not affect accessory protein interaction. Although its physiological significance is not clear, GGA1-GAE dimerization could help clathrin assembly by bringing together two clathrin triskelions, each of which binds to the hinge region of a distinct GGA1 molecule. In contrast to GGA1-GAE, g1 ear and GGA3-GAE are monomers in their reported crystal structures (28,33­35). Crystal structure of the complex between GGA1-GAE and the GGA1 hinge peptide We next co-crystallized GGA1-GAE with the GGA1 hinge peptide (376SLDGTGWNSFQSS388), and determined the ° structure of this complex at 2.55 A resolution by the molecular replacement method using the structure of free GGA1-GAE as a search model. An asymmetric unit contains four GGA1-GAE molecules (A, B, C and D) and two peptides (P and Q). Peptides P and Q bind to molecules A and C, respectively. We were unable to generate peptide models for molecules B and D because of poor electron density around the putative binding sites likely because of their low occupancies. The four GGA1-GAE molecules in the asymmetric unit can be superimposed on each other ° with rmsd less than 0.65 A for the Ca atoms of the eight b strands, and these molecules also form two dimers (molecules A­B and C­D) in a similar manner to that of free GGA1-GAE, despite belonging to different space groups. The overall structures of the GGA1-GAE molecules in the complexes are essentially the same as those of the free ° GGA1-GAE form with rmsd less than 0.96 A for the Ca atoms of the eight b strands. In the complex of GGA1-GAE and the hinge peptide, the peptides are in extended conformations bound by the surface formed by strands, b4, b5 and b7 (Figure 4A,B). We refer to the tryptophan residue of the peptide as Traffic 2007; 8: 904­913

position 0. The N-terminal five residues, (-6)SLDGT(-2), of both peptides (P and Q) are disordered and not visible in the electron density map. In both complexes, the two bulky hydrophobic residues at positions 0 and 3 are accommodated by two hydrophobic pockets formed by the b4 and b7 strands of GGA1-GAE (Figure 4C,D). The side chain of Trp(0) inserts into a hydrophobic pocket of GGA1-GAE formed by Ala563, Val564 and Pro565 of the b4 strand, and the aliphatic portions of the side chains of Arg607 and Arg609 of the b7 strand. Furthermore, the side chain of Phe(3) is inserted into the hydrophobic pocket formed by Gln561, Ser562 and Ala563 of the b4 strand, aliphatic portions of the side chains of Arg609 and Lys611 of the b7 strand and the side chain of Met624 of the b8 strand. The Ser(2) of peptide Q is disordered and not visible. Although the positions of residues Phe(3) through Ser(6) in the two peptides are essentially the same, those of residues Gly(-1) through Asn(1) slightly deviate from one another. Especially, the plane of the Trp(0) ring of peptide P is nearly perpendicular to that of peptide Q (Figure 4C,D). In the complex between molecule C and peptide Q, the aromatic ring of Trp(0) stacks with the guanidinium group of Arg609 of GGA1-GAE, forming a cation p interaction (36) (Figure 4D). In contrast, in the complex between molecule A and peptide P, the side chain of Arg609 of GGA1-GAE moves away from the peptide and does not form a stacking interaction with Trp(0) (Figure 4C). In addition to the hydrophobic interactions described above, there are four hydrogen bonds between the main chains of the ligand peptide and the b4 strand of GGA1-GAE, resulting in an intermolecular b sheet in both complexes in the asymmetric unit. The carbonyl oxygen of Gly(-1), the amide nitrogen of Asn(1) and the amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen of Gln(4) of the peptide backbone form hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogen of Lys566, the carbonyl oxygen of Val564 and the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of Ser562, respectively, of the GGA1-GAE main chain (Figures 4C,D and 5). Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain of Asn(1) and the main chains of Val564 and Pro565, and the side chain of Ser(5) and the side chain of Gln561 in molecule A and peptide P (Figures 4C and 5A). In the complex between molecule C and peptide Q, another set of hydrogen bonds are formed between the main chain of Asn(1) and the main chain of Val564, and the main chain of Phe(3) and the side chain of Gln561 (Figures 4D and 5B). Crystal structures of GGA-GAEs with acidic phenylalaninecontaining peptides derived from p56 (DDDDF(0)GGFEAAETFD) (27) and rabaptin-5 (DESDF(0)GPLVGADS) (28) have previously been reported. The side chains of Phe(0) and Phe(3)/Leu(3) of these peptides are accommodated in the hydrophobic pockets of GGA-GAEs in the same manner as the side chains of Trp(0) and Phe(3) of the GGA1 hinge peptide (SLDGTGW(0)NSFQSS). Most of the GGA1-GAE residues involved in the interaction with the acidic phenylalanine motif are also involved in binding 907

the GGA1 hinge (Figure 6); the aromatic ring of Phe(0) of both the p56 and the rabaptin-5 peptides stacks with the side chains of Arg609 of GGA1-GAE and Arg693 of GGA3GAE, respectively, in a similar orientation to that of Trp(0) of peptide Q in the GGA1-GAE/hinge complex. Moreover, the four hydrogen bonds formed between the main chain atoms of GGA-GAEs and the p56 and rabaptin-5 peptides also occur at the corresponding positions in the GGA1GAE/hinge complex. Thus, the binding of GGA1-GAE to the GGA1 hinge is essentially the same as the binding to the acidic phenylalanine motif, despite the fact that the WNSF sequence of the GGA1 hinge region deviates from the consensus sequence. Autoregulation of GGA1-GAE by the GGA1 hinge region The interaction between the GGA1-GAE and the GGA1 hinge peptide suggests that the WNSF sequence may compete with accessory protein binding to the GAE domain in full-length GGA1. To address this possibility, 908

we monitored, by fluorescent spectroscopy, changes in the structural environment near the tryptophan residue of the WNSF sequence upon the addition of a competing peptide derived from an accessory protein. To this end, we designed a GGA1 construct encompassing both the hinge region and the GAE domain (residues 350­639) in which two tryptophan residues (Trp444 and Trp636) are substituted with alanines to allow the monitoring of the fluorescence originating only from Trp382 within the WNSF sequence. In addition, we generated a GGA1 hinge þ GAE construct with a K611Q mutation; the corresponding mutation in g1 ear abolished its interaction with accessory proteins (34). When the fluorescence emission spectra of the wild type and K611Q mutant of the GGA1 hinge þ GAE construct were compared under the same conditions, the K611Q mutant was found to have a significantly reduced fluorescence intensity and a red-shifted peak (wild type, 344 nm versus K611Q, 350 nm) (Figure 7A). These results indicate that the environment around Trp382 of the K611Q mutant is more hydrophilic than that Traffic 2007; 8: 904­913

Crystal Structure of the GGA1-GAE/Hinge Complex

To examine whether the GGA1 hinge region competes for accessory protein binding to the same site of GGA1GAE, we monitored the fluorescence intensities of GGA1 hinge þ GAE in the presence of increasing amounts of the rabaptin-5 peptide (DESDFGPLVG). As shown in Figure 7B, substantial fluorescence quenching was observed as the increase in the amount of the peptide was added to the wild-type GGA1 hinge þ GAE construct. In striking contrast, these changes did not occur when the rabaptin-5 peptide was added to K611Q mutant GGA1 hinge þ GAE (data not shown). Thus, upon the addition of the rabaptin-5 peptide, the tryptophan residue of the WNSF sequence was unmasked by the GAE domain and became solvent exposed. We fitted the plots of fluorescence intensities of 5 mM GGA1 hinge þ GAE with varying rabaptin-5 peptide concentrations at 346 nm (Figure 7B). The calculated apparent Kd value between GGA1 hinge þ GAE and the rabaptin-5 peptide was 146 mM, which was about twice as high as that determined by SPR (69 mM; see Table 1). Thus, the interaction between the GGA1-GAE domain and the GGA1 hinge region could autoinhibit GGA1 function. Consistent with our results, Mattera et al. previously observed that a recombinant protein fragment containing the hinge region with the GGA1-GAE domain had a much lower affinity for rabaptin-5 than the GGA1-GAE domain alone (22). We next assessed whether the interaction between the GGA1 hinge and the GGA1-GAE domain occurs within a single GGA1 dimer or between two distinct dimers. If intermolecular interaction occurs between distinct GGA1 dimers, the increase in the concentration of GGA1 hinge þ GAE should lead to an increase in the apparent Kd value between the GGA1 hinge þ GAE and the rabaptin-5 peptide because of an increase in the fraction of the GGA1 hinge þ GAE molecules whose binding surface on GAE is occupied by the hinge region of another molecule. In contrast, if the interaction occurs only within the dimer, the apparent Kd value should be invariable irrespective of the concentration of GGA1 hinge þ GAE. We therefore measured apparent Kd values between the GGA1 hinge þ GAE and the rabaptin-5 peptide at increasing concentrations (0.5­100 mM) of GGA1 hinge þ GAE. As shown in Figure 7C, the apparent Kd value appeared invariable, with an average of 140 Æ 12 mM, within the examined concentration range, suggesting that the interaction between GGA1 hinge and GGA1-GAE occurs intramolecularly within a dimer. The GGA1 hinge region contains a clathrin box sequence, 356 LLDDE360, which binds the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) (13). The sequence is located upstream of the 382WNSF385 sequence. A second clathrin box sequence, 319LLDLS323, has recently been identified (37). We therefore examined whether the intramolecular interaction of GGA1 hinge þ GAE influence the interaction between GGA1 hinge and clathrin. As shown in Figure 8, 909

the K611Q mutation did not significantly affect the binding of GGA1 hinge þ GAE to the clathrin N-terminal domain, suggesting that clathrin can interact with clathrin boxes within GGA1 hinge independent of the autoregulatory event of GGA1. Thus, the data presented in this study indicate that the autoregulatory mechanism can modulate only interactions between GGA1-GAE and accessory proteins and between GGA1 hinge and g1 ear. GGA1 and AP-1 colocalize on the clathrin-coated buds at the TGN and are thought to co-operate in the packaging of MPRs into clathrin-coated vesicles (29, reviewed in 8) through the interaction of GGA1 hinge with g1 ear (30). The GGA1 is thought to subsequently transfer cargo molecules to AP-1 (29). Accessory proteins such as gsynergin, which have a higher affinity for g1 ear than GGA1-GAE (19), would bind to the g1 ear domain, rather than to GGA1-GAE, of the GGA1­AP-1 complex on the clathrin-coated buds. Thus, accessory proteins might displace GGA1 from AP-1 by disrupting the interaction of the GGA1 hinge and g1 ear causing the transfer of cargo molecules from GGA to AP-1.

DNA fragment encompassing residues 350­639 was subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid. Two of the three tryptophan residues within the GGA1 hinge þ GAE regions were replaced with alanines (W444A and W636A) using a Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). In addition to the above two mutations, another mutation, K611Q, was introduced into the GGA1 hinge þ GAE construct to eliminate binding to acidic phenylalanine sequences. These constructs were expressed and purified as described above, but GST was cleaved by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare Bio-Science) and the final purification was performed using a Mono Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare Bio-Science) with a linear gradient of 0­500 mM NaCl in 40 mM HEPES pH 7.0. For pull-down assay, a polypeptide, which includes clathrin boxes (CB) of the hinge region and GAE domain (GGA1-CB þ hinge þ GAE), residues 306­639, was subcloned into the pGEX4T-2 plasmid. Wild-type GGA1-CB þ hinge þ GAE and its K611Q mutant were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified by GS4B column and dialyzed against PBS buffer. Rat CHC cDNA fragment encompassing residues 1­494 was subcloned into the pGEX 4T-2 plasmid and expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified using GS4B column. The protein on GS4B column was cleaved by thrombin and eluted.

Crystallization and data collection
We have previously described the crystallization conditions for GGA1-GAE bound to the WNSF-containing peptide (33). Crystals of the free GGA1-GAE were obtained after about 1 week using the same conditions as the complex crystals. All data sets were collected at beamline AR-NW12A of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) under cryogenic conditions with crystals soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 15% glycerol and cooled to 100 8K in a nitrogen gas stream. The diffraction data were integrated and scaled with the program HKL2000 (38).

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification
GGA1-GAE was expressed and purified as described previously (33). Briefly, a DNA fragment for the GAE domain (residues 507­639) of human GGA1 was subcloned into the pGEX4T-2 plasmid (GE Healthcare Bio-Science, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The GST fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione­Sepharose 4B (GS4B) column (GE Healthcare Bio-Science) and cleaved by thrombin (GE Healthcare Bio-Science). The GGA1-GAE was then purified by size exclusion column chromatography using Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare Bio-Science) in 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0. For the fluorescence experiment, a polypeptide containing the hinge region and GAE domain of GGA1 (GGA1 hinge þ GAE), a GGA1 complementary

Structure determination and refinement
The crystal structure of the free form of GGA1-GAE was solved by the molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP (39) using the structure of human g1 ear (PDB accession number: 1IU1) as a search model. The model was refined using the programs CNS (40) and REFMAC5 ° (41) for the resolution range 50­2.3 A. The manual adjustments of the model were performed using Turbo-FRODO (42). The crystal contains four GGA1-GAE molecules in an asymmetric unit: molecule A (residues 511­ 639), molecule B (residues 511­636), molecule C (residues 507­510 and 512­639) and molecule D (residues 511­639). The final model has an R factor of 22.0% and Rfree of 26.0%. The statistics of the structure determination are summarized in Table 2.

Molecules A and C interact with peptides P and Q, respectively. The final model has an ° R factor of 23.9% and Rfree of 28.5% (resolution range 50­2.55 A). The statistics of the structure determination have been reported previously (33). Root mean square difference of structural superimposition was calculated using the program LSQKAB (43). Figures were prepared using the programs MolScript (44), GRASP (45), Raster3D (46) and LIGPLOT (47).

A) Comparison of the wild type (solid line) and the K611Q mutant (dotted line) of GGA1 hinge þ GAE. Spectra were measured at protein concentrations of 20 mM. B) Fluorescence intensities of wild-type GGA1 hinge þ GAE (5 mM) with varying concentrations of the rabaptin-5 peptide. Circles indicate the fluorescence intensities of the mixture of GGA1 hinge þ GAE and the rabaptin-5 peptide at 346 nm and the solid line shows the fitted curve. C) Effect of GGA1 hinge þ GAE concentration on the rabaptin-5 peptide binding. Apparent Kd values between the GGA1 hinge þ GAE and the rabaptin-5 peptide measured at varying concentrations of GGA1 hinge þ GAE are plotted.
Binding affinities between GGA1-GAE or g1 ear and ligand peptides were analyzed by SPR using Biacore2000 (Biacore). The GST-fused peptides, whose construction will be described elsewhere (Yamada et al., in preparation), were captured on a sensor chip CM5 (Biacore) coated with anti-GST antibody (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). All SPR experiments were carried out in 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5 buffer, at a flow rate of 20 mL/minutes at 293 8K. Surface plasmon resonance sensorgram was analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.2 program (Biacore). The dissociation constant, Kd, was calculated using the steady-state affinity model.

SAXS measurements
° The solution X-ray scattering data were collected on BL-10C (l ¼ 1.488 A) of the Photon Factory in Tsukuba, Japan. Each sample solution (30 mL) was introduced into a quartz slab cell with the path length of 1 mm and fixed in a sample holder at 298 8K. The scattered X-rays were recorded using a position sensitive proportional counter for 600 seconds at the distance of 900 mm from the sample position. A distance distribution function, P(r), was calculated from the scattering data using the program GNOM (48). Theoretical P(r) functions of the crystal structures of the GGA1-GAE monomer (molecule A) and the dimer (molecules A­B) were calculated with the program CRYSOL (49) and GNOM.

The crystal structure of GGA1-GAE in complex with the GGA1 hinge peptide was solved by the molecular replacement method with MOLREP using the structure of GGA1-GAE (molecule A) as a search model. The crystal contains four GGA1-GAE molecules: molecule A (residues 511­

Fluorescence measurements
Fluorescence spectra were analyzed using an F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan). All fluorescence experiments were carried out in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 at 293 8K. Fluorescence emission spectra of the wild-type GGA1 hinge þ GAE and its K611Q mutant were recorded at 20 mM protein concentration. The synthetic rabaptin-5 peptide (DESDFGPLVG), which is the same sequence as that used for SPR measurement (Table 1), was purchased from TORAY Research Center (Kamakura, Japan). For the competition experiment, solutions containing various concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mM) of GGA1 hinge þ GAE were incubated with 0, 50, 100, 250, 500 mM and 1 mM of the rabaptin-5 peptide. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, except for the measurements with 0.5, 1 and 2 mM GGA1 hinge þ GAE, for which excitation wavelength was 300 nm to avoid fluorescence from peptide. Apparent Kd values were determined by fitting fluorescent intensities at 346 nm using the equation: ÀÂ Ã Â Ã F ¼ F0 þ ðFmax À F0 Þ S þ P þ K À ðð½S þ ½P  þ K Þ2 Â ÃÂ Ã 1=2 Á Â Ã =2 S À4 S P Þ where F is the observed fluorescence, F0 is the fluorescence without peptide, Fmax is the fluorescence with a saturating concentration of peptide, [S] is the total concentration of GGA1-GAE þ hinge, [P] is the total concentration of peptide and K is the dissociation constant.
