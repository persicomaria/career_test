Enzyme Structure with Two Catalytic Sites for Double-Sieve Selection of Substrate

High-fidelity transfers of genetic information in the central dogma can be achieved by a reaction called editing. The crystal structure of an enzyme with editing activity in translation is presented here at 2.5 angstroms resolution. The enzyme, isoleucyl­transfer RNA synthetase, activates not only the cognate substrate L-isoleucine but also the minimally distinct L-valine in the first, aminoacylation step. Then, in a second, "editing" step, the synthetase itself rapidly hydrolyzes only the valylated products. For this twostep substrate selection, a "double-sieve" mechanism has already been proposed. The present crystal structures of the synthetase in complexes with L-isoleucine and L-valine demonstrate that the first sieve is on the aminoacylation domain containing the Rossmann fold, whereas the second, editing sieve exists on a globular -barrel domain that protrudes from the aminoacylation domain.

Editing reactions are essential for the high
fidelity of genetic information transfer in replication and translation (error rates of 1/2400 to 1/40,000) (1, 2). Translation accuracy depends on the editing activities of aminoacyl­tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) (2­ 4). The aaRSs esterify cognate amino acids with their specific tRNAs, which decode trinucleotide sequences (anticodons) into amino acids corresponding strictly to the genetic code. The amino acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) form an aminoacyl adenylate as an active intermediate, and the aminoacyl moiety is then transferred to the 3 terminal adenosine of the tRNA. The accuracy of protein biosynthesis depends on the correct recognition of amino acids and tRNAs by aaRSs. Discrimination between L-isoleucine and L-valine is one of the most difficult recognitions to achieve, because they differ by only one methylene group in their aliphatic side chains.

of a methylene group, the error rate for
L-valine replacing L-isoleucine to be about

one in five (5). Thus, it is thermodynamically impossible for isoleucyl­tRNA synthetase (IleRS) to achieve strict discrimination [an error rate as low as 1/40,000 (3)] between L-isoleucine and L-valine through ordinary one-step recognition. Actually, IleRS has an additional editing activity that hydrolyzes both valyl­adenosine monophosphate (Val-AMP) and Val-tRNAIle in a tRNAIle-dependent manner (2­4, 6, 7), as follows: IleRS Val ATP 3 PPi (1) tRNAIle 3 AMP tRNAIle (2)

IleRS Val-AMP IleRS Val-AMP IleRS Val

where PPi is inorganic pyrophosphate. In Eq. 1, the L-valine is activated. In Eq. 2, tRNA-dependent editing occurs. In this overall reaction, the Val-AMP is directly hydrolyzed to Val AMP in a pretransfer editing, and, in addition, some Val-tRNAIle forms, which is deacylated by the enzyme (posttransfer editing). The overall editing reaction (including both) is measured by the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of L-valine and tRNAIle. Fersht first proposed a "double-sieve" model for two-step substrate selection (2): Amino acids larger than the cognate L-isoleucine are strictly excluded by the first, amino acid activation site, serving as the "coarse sieve," and smaller ones, such as L-valine, are strictly eliminated by the "fine sieve" of the second hydrolytic site. The site for editing is distinct from that for amino acid activation (6, 8, 9). In addition to IleRS, valyl­tRNA synthetase (ValRS) has similar editing acVOL. 280 24 APRIL 1998

tivities against an isosteric substrate, L-threonine (3, 7). The crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus IleRS (1045 amino acid residues, 120 kD) and those of the complexes of IleRS with L-isoleucine and L-valine were determined at resolutions of 2.5, 2.8, and 2.8 Å, respectively (Table 1) (10). IleRS belongs to the class I synthetases (11), which are characterized by an ATP-binding domain constructed with a Rossmann fold. Thermus thermophilus IleRS is a thick, L-shaped molecule with an approximate size of 100 Å by 80 Å by 45 Å (Fig. 1). The IleRS structure exhibits the Rossmann-fold domain at the center, -rich intervening domains at the top, and an -rich cylindrical domain at the bottom (Fig. 1). The Rossmann-fold domain (shown in orange in Fig. 1) has a central deep catalytic cleft with two characteristic ATP-binding motifs, His54-Val55-Gly56-His57 and Lys591Met592-Ser 593-Lys594, on its lower level. In the L-isoleucine IleRS complex, one L-isoleucine molecule is bound at the bottom of this catalytic cleft (Fig. 2, A and B). The hydrophobic side chain of L-isoleucine is

recognized by a pocket consisting of Pro46, Trp518, and Trp558 through van der Waals interactions (Fig. 2B). The Asp85 and Gln554 residues form hydrogen bonds with

the NH3 and COO groups, respectively (Fig. 2B). These residues are completely conserved among the 17 IleRSs cloned thus far (12). The L-leucine side chain does not

fit into this pocket, because of the steric hindrance of one of the terminal methyl groups (13). Naturally, larger amino acids are occluded from this pocket. In contrast,

in the L-valine IleRS complex structure, an L-valine molecule is actually bound to the same site (Fig. 2C). The hydrophobic contact area of the L-valine side chain with those of Pro46 and Trp558 is slightly smaller than that of the L-isoleucine side chain (Fig. 2, B and C), which is consistent with the calculation by Pauling (5) and with previous kinetics (3). All of these results agree with the concept of the first, coarse sieve in the double-sieve mechanism of editing (2). All of the amino acid residues that form the amino acid­ binding pocket, except Gln554, are conserved in the ValRSs (12). In contrast, ValRS has an invariant Pro as a substitute for Gly45 neighboring Pro46, which may narrow the space within the hydrophobic pocket to exclude L-isoleucine. In fact, the substitution of Ala for Gly56 of Escherichia coli IleRS, which corresponds to the Gly45 of T. thermophilus IleRS, reduced the amino acid­ binding activities and completely eliminated the discrimination between Lisoleucine and L-valine (6). The Rossmann-fold domain has a -rich insert consisting of four structural domains (Ins-1 to Ins-4) (Fig. 1). The Ins-1 and Ins-4 domains (shown in blue and light green, respectively, in Fig. 1) have zinc ions coordinated to Cys181-X2-Cys184-X204Cys389-X2-Cys392 and Cys461-X2-Cys464X37-Cys502-X-Cys504 (where X is any amino acid), respectively. The Ins-1 zinc-binding structure includes an unusually long insert between the second and third Cys residues, which encompasses the entire 191-residue globular Ins-2 domain (shown in aqua in Fig. 1). A -barrel core and a protruding

ribbon of the Ins-2 domain form a deep cleft, the size of which is comparable to that of the catalytic cleft of the Rossmann-fold domain (Fig. 1). The "CP1" fragment (14) (corresponding to the present Ins-1 and Ins-2 domains) cloned from E. coli IleRS retains the specific Val-tRNAIle editing activity (9). In the present L-valine IleRS complex structure, a second L-valine molecule was identified at the bottom of the deep cleft in the Ins-2 domain (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, in the L-isoleucine IleRS complex structure, no electron density was observed in this second pocket (13). Therefore, the second pocket on the Ins-2 domain is specific for L-valine, indicating that this pocket is the site for the second, fine sieve of the double-sieve mechanism (2). The space made up of the invariant Trp232 and Tyr386 residues is just large enough to accommodate L-valine and therefore is too small for L-isoleucine (Fig. 3B). This is in striking contrast to the first pocket on the Rossmann-fold domain, where there is room for one more methyl group in the L-valine IleRS complex structure (Fig. 2C). This result is consistent with the previous finding that the substitution of Phe for Tyr403, which corresponds to Tyr386 of the T. thermophilus IleRS, substantially affects the editing activity of the E. coli IleRS (8). To demonstrate that the cleft on the Ins-2 domain actually functions as the hydrolytic editing site, we constructed an IleRS mutant [ (219 to 265)] that lacks 47 amino acid residues, including the Trp232 of the L-valine­specific pocket. This deletion mutation completely abolished the ValtRNAIle editing activity, in accordance

with our placement of the second, fine sieve at this site. This mutant exhibited nearly the same (or even slightly higher) activity for Ile-tRNAIle synthesis [a Michaelis constant (Km) value of 91 M for L-isoleucine and a first-order rate constant (kcat) value of 0.78 s 1] as that of the wild-type IleRS (a Km value of 45 M for L-isoleucine and a kcat value of 0.69 s 1) (15). On the other hand, the ability of this mutant IleRS to mischarge tRNAIle with L-valine was drastically higher (the Km value for L-valine and the kcat value are 86 M and 0.21 s 1, respectively) than that of the wild type (not detectable). It is surprising that the Km value for L-valine is the same as that for L-isoleucine in the aminoacyl-tRNA formation. The discrimination factor is as small as 3.5 and agrees well with the values that had been obtained by theoretical calculations (5) and previous kinetic measurements (3). This result demonstrates that the discrimination between L-isoleucine and L-valine depends primarily on the editing reaction. The cleft on the Ins-2 domain is now identified as the catalytic site for specific editing against Val. Manual fitting of ValAMP and Val-tRNAIle into this cleft confirmed that the mouth of the cleft is wide enough to accommodate the valylated products (13), but, once bound, how are the valylated products hydrolyzed? Near the Lvaline­specific pocket, two absolutely conserved peptide segments come together to form the bottom of the cleft in the Ins-2 domain. The first peptide segment has a Thr-rich sequence, Trp227-Thr-Thr-ThrPro-Trp-Thr-X-X-X-Asn, in which the Trp232 residue is involved in the L-valine­

REPORTS
specific pocket (Fig. 3B). The second segment has a sequence of Gly314-Thr-Gly-XVal-His. In the present structure, Thr230 in the first segment is closest to the carboxyl oxygen of the bound L-valine; the O atom is 5.0 Å away from the carboxyl oxygen (Fig. 4). Furthermore, near the bound Lvaline, Thr228, Thr230, Thr233, and Asn237 from the first segment and His319 from the second segment are located in close proximity (Fig. 4), which is reminiscent of the catalytic triads of hydrolases (16­18). Finally, a water molecule was found to be tightly bound in the editing cleft (Fig. 4). Further mutagenesis analyses were made on the E. coli IleRS (19), which has been the most extensively studied IleRS in terms of editing catalysis (2­4, 6­9, 20). Ala mutations of Thr243 and Asn250, which correspond to Thr230 and Asn237, respectively, of T. thermophilus IleRS, completely abolished editing activity against Val, with little change in aminoacylation activity. In contrast, Ala mutants of Thr241 and Thr246, corresponding to the T. thermophilus Thr228 and Thr233, respectively, showed nearly the same editing activities as the wild-type enzyme (21). These mutagenesis results confirm the identity of this cleft as the editing site and the catalytic importance of both Thr230 and Asn237. ValRS also exhibits an editing activity, which deacylates Thr-AMP and ThrtRNAVal (3, 7). A sequence alignment between IleRSs and ValRSs revealed that ValRSs also have two corresponding invariant peptide segments, Ala-Thr-X-Arg-ProGlu-Thr-X-X-X-Asp and Gly-Thr-Gly-XLys. The invariant Asp and Lys residues of ValRSs correspond to Asn237 and His319, respectively, of T. thermophilus IleRS. The Trp residue in the L-valine­specific pocket of the IleRS is switched to the invariant Glu residue, which may recognize the hydrophilic side chain of the misactivated Lthreonine. The present findings show that the "editing" reaction is the latter half of a stepwise substrate selection and is not an ordinary error correction. Therefore, this reaction is unique among the essential editing or proofreading processes necessary to achieve high accuracy of information transfer in the central dogma (replication, transcription, and translation) (1, 2). The ATP consumption with regard to L-valine is nonproductive and is solely for substrate selection, which demonstrates the high cost of accuracy. The Ile-Val discrimination is biologically important. For example, a single Ile-Val mutation reduces protein stability (22) and has a substantial effect on biological phenomena, such as lung cancer susceptibility (23) and human immunodeficiency virus­1 drug resistance (24). On the other hand, it is interesting from an evolutionary viewpoint that all of the enzymes catalyzing the central steps of Ile-Val biosynthesis and metabolism do not distinguish, or can neglect the difference, between the two aliphatic amino acids, as was observed for the first catalytic site of IleRS. This finding implies that a putative ancestral enzyme of IleRS and ValRS might have actually had a similar dual specificity for L-isoleucine and L-valine in a primordial genetic code system.

The T. thermophilus IleRS gene was cloned into a T 7 polymerase expression vector and was overexpressed in E. coli strain JM109(DE3) (S. Fukai et al., in preparation). The recombinant protein was purified by a combination of heat treatment, anion-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase fast performance liquid chromatography. Crystals were grown at 20°C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method (protein concentration of 20 mg/ml) against a reservoir solution containing 12% polyethylene glycol 4000, 6% isopropanol, 1% 2-methyl-pentane2,4-diol, and 60 mM Hepes (pH 7.5). Two mutant proteins, with substitutions of Cys for Ala or Lys, were expressed, purified, and used for the preparation of mercury derivatives. Furthermore, we incorporated selenium into the IleRS by preparing the IleRS from the E. coli Met-auxotroph B834 strain cultured in the presence of selenomethionine. Crystals of the Cys- and selenomethionine-substituted proteins were grown by cross seeding. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by cocrystallization of the Cys mutants and methylmercurichloride. Native and heavy atom derivative data were collected to 2.5 Å with a Weissenberg camera for macromolecules installed on the beam line 6A2 at the Photon Factory ( Tsukuba, Japan). The data set for crystal of selenomethionine-substituted IleRS was collected inhouse on a Raxis-IIc (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku x-ray source. All of the data were processed with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (25). Subsequent calculations were carried out with the CCP4 program suite (26). Initial mercury sites in the derivative of the K3C mutant were determined with the RSPS program (26) from an isomorphous difference Patterson map. The phases from the mercury derivative were used to locate the positions of other mercury and selenium atoms by difference Fourier analysis. Heavy-atom parameters were refined with the MLPHARE (26) program. The overall figure of merit from 50 to 3.0 Å resolution is 0.74. After density modification with solvent flattening and histogram matching in the program DM (26) and solvent flipping in the SOLOMON (27 ) program, the atomic model of residues 1 to 818 could be built with the program O (28). Crystallographic positional and slow-cooling refinement was carried out with X-PLOR (29). The Ramachandran plot analysis with the PROCHECK (30) program showed that 98.2% of the residues in the present structure are in the most favorable and the additionally allowed regions. We obtained the Ile and Val complexes by transferring the crystals to a harvest buffer containing 10 mM amino acid substrates. The data sets were collected on a Raxis-IIc image plate detector. After rigid-body refinement in the program AMORE (26), the R factors were reduced. 11. G. Eriani, M. Delarue, O. Poch, J. Gangloff, D. Moras, Nature 347, 203 (1990). 12. S.

Affinity-driven selection of B lymphocytes within germinal centers is critical for the development of high-affinity memory cells and host protection. To investigate the role of the CD21/CD35 coreceptor in B cell competition for follicular retention and survival within the germinal center, either Cr2 or Cr2null lysozyme-specific transgenic B cells were adoptively transferred into normal mice immunized with duck (DEL) or turkey ( TEL) lysozyme, which bind with different affinities. In mice injected with high-affinity turkey lysozyme, Cr2null B cells responded by follicular retention; however, they could not survive within germinal centers. This suggests that CD21 provides a signal independent of antigen that is required for survival of B cells in the germinal center.

The murine Cr2 locus encodes complement receptors CD21 (CR2; 150 kD) and CD35 (CR1; 190 kD) that are expressed primarily on B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (1). Cr2null mice have impaired immune responses to T-dependent antigens (2, 3); the defect is in the B cell compartment (2, 4). The natural ligands for CD21 and CD35 are activation products of complement C3 (C3d and C3b, respectively) (5) that are covalently coupled to antigen (6); mice deficient in C3 have impaired

humoral responses similar to those observed in Cr2null animals (7). In studies in which fusion proteins of C3d and hen egg lysozyme (HEL) were used, B cell activation in vitro and in vivo was enhanced and dependent on the presence and density of C3d (8). Thus, CD21/CD35 may be a potent coreceptor for complement-decorated antigens that can raise the intensity of suboptimal activating signals. To examine directly the fate of B cells deficient in CD21/CD35 in an immune recipient, we bred Cr2null mice with mice expressing a transgenic (tg) immunoglobulin (Ig) consisting of both heavy and light chains, which bind avian egg lysozymes with very high affinity (9). The importance of CD21/CD35 as a coreceptor in B cell activation by antigen ligands that bind with increasingly substantial affinities was examined by comparing the response of Cr2 and Cr2null lysozyme-specific Ig tg B cells to DEL and TEL, respectively (10, 11).

Dependence of Germinal Center B Cells on Expression of CD21/CD35 for Survival

expected, 10- to 100-fold less TEL than DEL was required for the induction of proliferative responses and up-regulation of the CD86 costimulator molecule in both groups of tg B cells (12). Thus, activation through the B cell receptor (BCR) in the absence of complement is comparable in Cr2 and Cr2null tg B cells, and B cell activation and proliferation is proportional to antigen affinity. To examine the importance of B cell expression of CD21/CD35 in combination with low-affinity antigen (DEL) in vivo, we adoptively transferred splenic B cells isolated from either Cr2 or Cr2null lysozymespecific Ig tg mice with DEL into wild-type (WT) recipients that had been primed 7 days earlier with DEL (13, 14). Cr2null tg B cells from the spleen declined over the 5-day period in the DEL-primed recipients (Fig. 1A); by day 5 after transfer, there were 75% fewer Cr2null than Cr2 tg B cells (0.26 0.04% versus 1.14 0.26%, respectively; P 0.01) in the recipient spleens (15). An increase in Cr2null tg B cells in the blood was observed by day 5 (Fig. 1B); however, this did not account for the loss of cells from the spleen given the relatively low number of B cells in blood compared with spleen. Loss of Cr2null tg cells from the spleen was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 2, A to D, and Table 1) and correlated with a low frequency of expression of CD86 (B7-2) at day 1 after transfer (12). Although similar numbers of Cr2 and Cr2null tg B cells were present on day 1 in the primary splenic follicles of immune recipients (Fig. 2, A and C), by day 5 less than 2% of follicles held Cr2null tg B cells compared with 85% of follicles positive for Cr2 tg B cells (Fig. 2, B and D, and Table 1) (16). The loss of the Cr2null tg B cells in DEL-immune recipients was greater than that in nonimmune con-
