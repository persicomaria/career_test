Abstract Interferon g (IFNg) has been reported as a possible therapeutic agent for contractile diseases in clinical trials and in vitro studies. It is not yet clear, however, whether IFNg simply inhibits myofibroblast generation or downregulates a smooth muscle actin (aSMA) production in myofibroblasts. In this study, we attempted to clarify how IFNg acts in the generation of myofibroblasts, and the production of aSMA by myofibroblasts, using immunofluorescence staining, cell capture enzyme immunoassay (CC-EIA) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for aSMA. We examined whether IFNg could block the TGFh1-promoted changes in myofibroblasts or the generation of myofibroblasts by TGFh1. IFNg strongly blocked the generation of myofibroblasts and moderately inhibited the production of aSMA in TGFh1-promoted myofibrobasts. These findings indicate that IFNg may be effective in the early stage of contractile diseases to prevent the progression of contractile lesions. D 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Dupuytren's contracture is a contractile disease in the fascia of the human palm. The disease involves the functional obstruction of finger movement by formation of nodules in the fascia of the palm. The only treatment is surgical resection of the nodule, but the

nodule formation recurs frequently. Since myofibroblast-rich nodules occur in the lesion, and myofibroblasts are closely associated with the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's contracture, the majority of myofibroblasts appear to arise from fibroblasts by enhancing production of a smooth muscle actin (aSMA) [1]. Since the myofibroblast is a common cell in granulation tissue, and artificial overexpression of aSMA does not induce contracture of tissue [2,3], aSMA in the myofibroblast may not itself be directly associated with the induction of Dupuytren's contracture.

blasts is similar to that in cultured Dupuytren's cells. In this study, we constructed a model for generating myofibroblasts using TGFh1-stimulated human fibroblasts, and attempted to clarify whether IFNg inhibits the generation of myofibroblasts or the downregulation of aSMA production in myofibroblasts.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Cells The human fibroblastic cell line, WI-38, was cultured in Earl's minimum essential medium (EMEM, Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were cultured in a 96-well microplate (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA) at a density of 1 Â 104 cells/ml at 37 jC for 24 h. In some experiments, TGFh1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used for the induction of aSMA in fibroblasts. To induce aSMA in WI-38 cells, TGFh1 solution at final concentrations of 0­ 5 ng/ml was added to 1 Â 104 cells/well in a microplate, and the cells were cultured at 37 jC for 7 days under 5% CO2 atmosphere with a medium change on the third day of culture. In some experiments, to demonstrate the downregulation of aSMA production, TGFh1-treated WI-38 cells were cultured in the presence of 100 U/ml IFNg (Roche Diagnostics,

contrast, Tomasek et al. [1,4] described a significant correlation between aSMA expression and the generation of contractile force in Dupuytren's nodules. At present, although it is not clear whether aSMA is directly associated with the contracture of tissue, aSMA is considered to be a useful marker of myofibroblasts in contractile diseases. Pittet et al. [5] demonstrated in their clinical pilot study that injection of interferon g (IFNg) into lesions of hypertrophic scars and Dupuytren's nodules revealed a therapeutic effect in humans. They qualitatively demonstrated that IFNg reduces aSMA production in cells from the lesions. Sanders et al. [6] reported that IFNa2b decreases contraction of Dupuytren's cells, and Tanaka et al. [7] quantitatively demonstrated that IFNg reduces aSMA production in Dupuytren's cells and transforming growth factor h1 (TGFh1)-treated cells, both in vitro. These studies indicated that IFNs could be promising drugs for the treatment of contractile diseases such as Dupuytren's contracture. It is not yet clear, however, whether IFNg simply inhibits fibroblast transformation or downregulates aSMA production in myofibroblasts. Tanaka et al. [7] demonstrated the downregulation of aSMA production by IFNg in a TGFh1-stimulated human fibroblast cell line. They also showed that such downregulation in TGFh1-stimulated fibro-

Mannheim, Germany), and examined by the assays described below. 2.2. Antibodies, chemicals and cell capture enzyme immunoassay (CC-EIA) for aSMA The cell capture enzyme immunoassay (CC-EIA) for aSMA [7] was applied. In brief, cultured cells were fixed in a 96-well microtiter plate with 4% formalin as described previously [8], and treated with 3% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific immunoreactions. The fixed cells were treated with 32.5 Ag/ ml anti-aSMA mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 150 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) for 30 min at 37 jC and washed in PBS. The cells were reacted again with 50 Ag/ml alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-labeled anti-mouse goat antibody (Cappel, Ohio, USA) in 150 mM PBS, for 30 min at 37 jC and washed in PBS. For colorization, a paranitrophosphate kit (MonotestALPot; Roche Diagnostics) was used with the addition of 4.8% levamisole to block endogenous ALP. The optical density of the colored solution was measured in a

microplate reader (NJ-200, Japan InterMed, Tokyo, Japan) at 405 nm wavelength. The background O.D. value was subtracted from the direct O.D. value; the difference represented the amount of aSMA. This assay revealed a linear correlation between the number of cells which fully expressed aSMA and the O.D. value between 0.2 and 1.0 (data not shown), and was considered to be semiquantitative. 2.3. Immunofluorescence staining WI-38 cells were cultured on a chamber glass slide with or without TGFh1 for 3 days and air-dried for 1 h. The cells were fixed with 5% formalin in 150 mM PBS (pH 7.2) for 30 min and washed in 150 mM PBS (pH 7.2). The fixed cells were reacted with anti-aSMA mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 37 jC for 30 min in a moist chamber and washed in 150 mM PBS (pH 7.2). After the washing, the cells were reacted with the fluorescence isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse goat antibody (ZYMED Laboratories, CA, USA) at 37 jC for 30 min in a moist chamber and washed again in 150 mM PBS (pH 7.2). The cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). 2.4. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) The primer pair used in reverse transcription (RT)PCR for aSMA was purchased from Stratagene (Cal-

ifornia, USA). The sequences of the primers were as follows: sense primer, 5V CTCACGGAGGCACCCCG TGAA3V antisense primer, 5V TGATAGGACATTGT; C TAGCAT3V The expected size of the PCR product was . 590 bp [9]. Prior to the gene amplification with Gene Amp PCR system 9700 (PE Applied Biosystems, California, USA), mRNAs were isolated using the Micro-FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen, California, USA) from 5 Â 105 cells. The amplification reaction was performed using GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR Kit (PE Applied Biosystems), following the instruction manual attached to the kit. Temperature profiles were as follows: one cycle of denaturation for 60 s at 94 jC and annealing and reverse transcription for 30 min at 60 jC, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 jC and annealing for 60 s at 65 jC, and a final extension for 10 min at 65 jC. The PCR products obtained were mixed with loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis. Chromosomal DNA was extracted from half the amount of the same fibroblasts and amplified with the primer pair for h-globin (Stratagene). The expected

size of the PCR product was 109 bp. The amplification reaction was performed in a 50-Al volume with temperature profiles as follows: one cycle of denaturation for 60 s at 94 jC, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 jC and annealing for 60 s at 65 jC, and a final extension for 10 min at 65 jC with Gene Amp PCR system 9700 (PE Applied Biosystems). The gel was stained using the SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel staining kit (FMC Bioproducts, Maine, USA) and observed through a transilluminator at a wavelength of 312 nm.

addition of TGFh1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The maximum induction was observed at TGFh1 concentrations of 1 ­ 5 ng/ml. To determine the optimal concentrations of IFNg in the subsequent experiments for inhibition of aSMA production, WI-38 cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFh1 and cultured in the presence of IFNg. aSMA production was inhibited by IFNg in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 2) and was completely blocked at concentrations equal to or greater than 50 U/ml. From the above results, we determined the optimal transformation to be at 5 ng/ml of TGFh1 and optimal inhibition to be 100 U/ml IFNg for subsequent experiments. 3.2. Initiation of aSMA production

To determine the optimal concentrations of TGFh1 for constructing a model of Dupuytren's cell, WI-38 cells were cultured at various concentrations of the cytokine. aSMA production was increased by the

scopic study, when fibroblasts were stimulated with TGFh1 in the first 3 days of culture, the intensity level of the fluorescence signal for aSMA in the cells (Figs. 3-1a and 3-2a) was almost the same as that in the fibroblasts stimulated throughout the entire culture period (Figs. 3-1b and 3-2b). In contrast, when fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of TGFh1 in the next 3 days of culture, the fluorescence intensity for aSMA in the cells (Figs. 3-1c and 3-2c) was almost the same as that in the unstimulated fibroblasts (Figs. 3-1d and 3-2d). Similar results were obtained in the measurement of the relative amount of aSMA by CC-EIA (Fig. 3-3). Almost the same relative amount of aSMA was detected in the fibroblasts treated with TGFh1 for the first 3 days of culture as that for the entire culture period. The TGFh1 treatment in the next 3 days of culture did not stimulate aSMA production. Since these results suggest that aSMA production can be initiated in the early stages of the culture of fibroblasts, we used fibroblasts treated with TGFh1 for the first 3 days in culture as a model of myofibroblast generation in the subsequent experiments. 3.3. IFNc treatment of TGFb1-stimulated fibroblasts To clarify whether IFNg interferes with generation of myofibroblasts in the first 3 days of culture, fibroblasts cultured in the presence of TGFh1 and IFNg were observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence signal intensity for aSMA in the fibroblasts treated with IFNg during the TGFh1 stimulation (Figs. 4-1a and 4-2a) was almost the same as that in the unstimulated fibroblasts (Figs. 4-1b and 4-2b). In fibroblasts cultured in the presence of IFNg after TGFh1 stimulation, the fluorescence signal intensity level for aSMA (Figs. 4-1c and 4-2c) was slightly reduced compared with that in the IFNguntreated fibroblasts stimulated with TGFh1 (Figs. 4-1d and 4-2d). The signal pattern became homogenous in TGFh1-promoted cells following treatment with IFNg (Fig. 4-2c), compared with IFNg-untreated preparations (Fig. 4-2d). In the CC-EIA assay, aSMA production in the fibroblasts treated with IFNg during TGFh1 stimulation (Fig. 4-3a) decreased to the same level as that in the unstimulated fibroblasts (Fig. 43b). When IFNg was added to fibroblasts after TGFh1 stimulation, aSMA production decreased to about 50% of that in the IFNg-untreated fibroblasts

(Fig. 4-3c,d). These results indicate that IFNg strongly blocks the myofibroblast generation as manifested by the initiation of aSMA production and moderately inhibits the aSMA production in the myofibroblast. These decreases were statistically analysed by Student's t analysis and appeared to be significant ( p < 0.002). 3.4. Production of mRNA for aSMA To clarify whether the blockage of aSMA production is due to the suppression of mRNA production, the level of mRNA expression for aSMA in the same number of cells was examined by RT-PCR. Assay control for RT-PCR kit was presented in Fig. 5A, lane 1. The expression was not detectable in TGFh1unstimulated fibroblasts of mRNA for aSMA, but was readily apparent in treated cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3). When the TGFh1-stimulated fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of IFNg, the signal intensity decreased to almost undetectable levels (Fig. 5A, lane 4). To confirm the number of fibroblasts in this PCR experiment, the amount of amplicon of the chromosomal gene for h-globin was examined. All three samples of fibroblasts revealed bands with almost the same intensity (Fig. 5B). The densitometric analyses of the bands were 1.194 F 0.066, 1.168 F 0.065 and 1.264 F 0.065 in fibroblasts, TGFh1-promoted myofibroblasts and IFNg-treated myofibroblasts stimulat-

ed with TGFh1, respectively. Since no significant differences were observed by Student's t analysis ( p < 0.002), the number of cells examined were almost identical.

4. Discussion Baird et al. [10] demonstrated that the concentrations of interleukin-1a, interleukin-1h, TGFh and

basic fibroblast growth factor are high in Dupuytren's nodules. Since TGFh1 stimulates aSMA expression in fibroblasts [11], and induces the formation of myofibroblast-rich Dupuytren's nodules [12], the cytokine is considered to be associated with the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease [13]. The myofibroblast is defined as an aSMA-rich fibroblast. Although the aSMA expression by myofibroblasts appears to be transient in granulation tissue, aSMA is a suitable marker of myofibroblasts in vitro [4,14]. In this study, we constructed a model for the generation of myofibroblasts from a TGFh1-stimulated human fibroblast cell line by monitoring aSMA production, and found that TGFh1 induces myofibroblasts in the early stages of culture. The fibroblasts that were stimulated with TGFh1 only in the first 3 days of culture actively produced aSMA. However, those that were stimulated only in the next 3 days did not. In previous studies [4,6], an in vitro model of Dupuytren's cells was obtained from a diseased nodule. Our results indicate that the fibroblasts stimulated by TGFh1 only in the first 3 days are initiated cells for myofibroblast formation, and are considered to be a model of Dupuytren's cells. Using generating/generated myofibroblasts, we examined whether IFNg could block the TGFh1-promoted changes or the generation of myofibroblasts. Since the aSMA production was blocked by IFNg in TGFh1-stimulated fibroblasts, the cytokine could block the generation of myofibroblasts. When TGFh1-stimulated fibroblasts were cultured further in the presence of IFNg, the aSMA and its mRNA production decreased in the cells. These results are similar to that of IFNa2b as Sanders et al. [6] reported. Vaughan and Tomasek [15,16] reported that IFNg blocks the TGFh1-promoted changes of myofibroblasts including aSMA production and cellular fiber assembly in cultured Dupuytren's cells. In our study, the signal pattern was homogenous in TGFh1promoted cells cultured with IFNg. The phenomenon may indicate that IFNg also blocks the aSMA assembly as well as aSMA production. The new findings of our study are that IFNg strongly blocks the generation of myofibroblasts by TGFh1, and that IFNg moderately blocks aSMA production. These findings may suggest that IFNg is effective in the early stage of Dupuytren's contracture in preventing the progression of this disease.

The above findings may also be important for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease. In the very early stage of the disease, TGFh1 is locally produced as an inflammatory cytokine. When a sufficient amount of IFNg is produced in the local lesion following TGFh1 production, the promotion of myofibroblasts may be suppressed [1]. As Tomasek et al. [1] suggested, a possible mechanism for the worsening of Dupuytren's disease might involve the local suppression of CD4+ T cells which secrete IFNg, or the insufficient filtration of T cells due to a disturbance in microcirculation in Dupuytren's nodule. Our findings may support these hypothetical explanations. A few clinical trials [5,17] of IFNg therapy for contractile disease have been performed. Since our study has provided in vitro evidence for the effectiveness of IFNg on myofibroblasts, further clinical trials of IFNg treatment for contractile diseases should be performed.
