The crystal structure of the glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP) complexed Ê with its ligand (Gln) was determined and re®ned to 1.94 A resolution. This ellipsoidal protein has two globular domains and is approximately Ê Ê Ê 52 A Â 40 A Â 35 A in size. The glutamine ligand is located in the cleft between the two domains and stablized by hydrogen bondings and ionic interactions with Asp10, Gly68, Thr70, Ala67, Asp157, Arg75, Lys115, Gly119 and His156. The aliphatic portion of the glutamine ligand is sandwiched in a hydrophobic pocket formed between Phe13 and Phe50 and has 21 van der Waals contacts with GlnBP. Lys115 and His156, that are unique to GlnBP among amino acid binding proteins, apparently contribute to the ligand binding speci®city of GlnBP. Asp10 is within Ê Ê 3 A of Lys115. These two residues are over 10 A apart in the ligand-free form of the GlnBP. In addition, GlnBP-Gln exhibits a large-scale movement of the two hinges connecting the two globular domains upon ligand binding. The most signi®cant changes are 41.1 in the f angle of Gly89 and 34.3 in the c angle of Glu181 from the ®rst and the second hinge of the protein, respectively. Besides the original six hydrogen bonds, three extra hydrogen bonds can be observed between the two hinge strands upon ligand binding. A hydrogen bond network connects the large domain to the second hinge and a second hydrogen bond network coalesces the small domain to the same strand, both via interaction with the glutamine ligand. Although the two strands of the hinge connecting the domains do not directly participate in the ligand binding, Gln183 and Tyr185 from the second hinge may be involved in the cascade of the conformational change that is induced by ligand binding.

Introduction
The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a complex structure, consisting of an outer membrane, a thin cell wall, the periplasmic space, and the cytoplasmic membrane (Ames, 1986). Within the cell envelope, receptors needed for cell-cell interactions and nutrient transportation are anchored. The glutamine permease system is one of the best-characterized osmotic shock-sensitive transport systems and is an excellent model for studying the essential process in membrane transAbbreviations used: GlnBP, glutamine-binding protein; r.m.s., root-mean-square; SA, simulated annealing.

port. It consists of a ligand-speci®c periplasmic glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP), and two membrane-bound protein components (Nohno et al., 1986). The dependence of glutamine transport on GlnBP was ®rst demonstrated by Weiner & Heppel (1971). The ®rst periplasmic binding protein, sulfate binding protein, was identi®ed by Pardee et al. (1966) in Salmonella typhimurium. Since then, a number of periplasmic binding proteins have been isolated, mainly from Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium. Their substrates include amino acids, sugars, peptides, anions, and vitamins (Furlong, 1987). Numerous biological and biochemical studies (Quiocho, 1990) have shown that they share some common properties. They are heat stable monomeric proteins with a molecular mass of

The binding af®nity in terms of dissociation constants (Kd) is between 0.1 mM for amino acids and 1 mM for sugars. The structure of 13 different binding proteins has been elucidated by X-ray diffraction (Hsiao et al., 1996). They share an a/b secondary structural topology and have two similar globular domains connected by two or three short ¯exible peptide hinges. The two domains form a deep cleft for substrate binding. The cleft partially closes and traps the substrate upon binding. Models for the ligand-speci®c periplasmic binding protein system have been proposed (Ames, 1986; Quiocho, 1990). The most recent model (Quiocho, 1990) depicts that the ligand enters the periplasmic space and binds with high af®nity to the corresponding periplasmic binding protein, thereby inducing a large conformational change in the protein. This conformational change is believed to be required for the recognition of the periplasmic binding protein by the membrane-bound protein components. The interactions between the protein-ligand complex and the membrane-bound components results in the translocation of the ligand from the former to the latter protein followed by the transfer of the ligand across the periplasmic membrane. The mechanics of the ligand-induced conformational changes can be directly identi®ed by determining the protein conformation in the ligand-free and ligand-bound forms. Only two X-ray crystal structures of periplasmic binding proteins in both conformations have been reported. Sharff et al. (1992) showed that the conformational changes of MMBP induced by ligand binding could be described by a rigid-body ``hinge'' bending between the two globular domains by an approximately 35 rotation coupled with an 8 twist. The ligand-induced conformational changes observed in LAOBP was described by Oh et al. (1993, 1994) as a large movement of a 52 rotation around a single backbone torsion angle between the two domains. The large and dissimilar conformational changes observed between the ligand-free and ligand-bound forms in MMBP and LAOBP lends support to the idea that the receptors differentiate the ligand-bound proteins by their unqiue three-dimensional structures. We have previously reported the ligand-free structure of GlnBP (Hsiao et al., 1996). GlnBP is the smallest periplasmic binding protein determined by X-ray diffraction. It is a monomeric, basic protein of 226 residues (molecular mass of 24,935 Da). It binds L-glutamine in a 1:1 molar ratio with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 5 Â 10À7 M at 5 C and pH 7.2. GlnBP is stable with respect to extremes of temperature (up to 41 C) and pH (5.0 to 8.0) (Shen et al., 1989a; Hunt & Hong, 1983). Here we report the ligand-bound, closed-cleft form of GlnBP at Ê 1.94 A resolution.

Structure of Glutamine-binding Protein

Results
The overall structure In contrast to the ligand-free ``open-cleft'' structure (Hsiao et al., 1996), the structure of the GlnBP-Gln complex (Figure 1(a)) represents a ``closed-cleft'' structure. It is composed of two similar globular domains designated as the large domain (residues 1 to 84 and 186 to 226) and small domain (residues 90 to 180). Each domain contains a central core of b-sheet ¯anked by a-helices. The folding topology of the ligand-bound form is similar to the ligand-free protein. The structure can be represented by a prolate ellipsoid with approxiÊ Ê Ê mate dimensions of 52 A Â 40 A Â 35 A. It is smalÊ Â 40 A Â 35 A Ê Ê ler than the dimensions of 60 A observed for the ligand-free structure (Figure 1(b)), as expected. The two domains are linked by two peptide hinges (residues 85 to 89 and 181 to 185). The interface between the domains forms a compact deep binding cleft which contains the bound glutamine. Least-squares superposition (Ca) of the large (residues 4 to 84 and 186 to 224) and small (residues 90 to 180) domains of the GlnBP-Gln complex with the corresponding domains of the ligand-free Ê structure gave r.m.s. deviations of 0.63 A and Ê , respectively, indicating small local pertur0.79 A bations within each domain in addition to the large conformational change occurrences upon ligand binding. The ligand binding pocket As in all other ligand-bound ``closed-cleft'' form structures, L-Gln is bound in a pocket formed between the two domains. The ligand is completely buried within the protein, as indicated by zero solvent accessibility (Lee & Richards, 1971) of the ligand. The large domain provides the majority of protein-ligand interactions. In the GlnBP-Gln complex a total of 13 hydrogen bonds, nine from the large domain and four from the small domain, are observed between the protein and the ligand. The side-chains participate in glutamine binding (shown in Figure 2(a)) include charged, polar, and non-polar side-chains, as well as atoms from the peptide backbone. The number of protein-ligand interactions observed are the most among amino acid binding proteins reported. The a-amino group of the ligand is stabilized by interacting with residues Gly68, Thr70 and Asp157. The NH moiety of the ligand constitutes hydro3 gen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly68, the hydroxyl group of Thr70 and the sidechain (Od1) of Asp157. An ionic interaction can also be found between the side-chain of Asp157 and the NH moiety of the ligand. The a-carboxyl group of 3 the ligand interacts with Thr70, Arg75 and Gly119. The main-chain nitrogen atoms of Thr70 and Gly119 form hydrogen bonding while the sidechain (NH1 and NH2) of Arg75 neutralizes the

opposite charges and form salt bridges with the COOÀ group of the ligand. The ligand side-chain of glutamine was anchored and stabilized by interacting with residues Asp10, Ala67, Lys115 and His156. The side-chain (Od2) of Asp10 and the main chain oxygen of Ala67 form ionic interaction and hydrogen bonding with Ne2 of the ligand. The side-chain atoms, Nz of Lys115 and Ne2 of His156, form hydrogen bonds to the Oe1 of the ligand. The mode of ligand binding observed in the GlnBP-Gln complex is consistent with the proposed model of the complex (Hsiao et al., 1996) based on the HisJHis complex described by Oh et al. (1994), which was used in the structure determination. Although the major interactions between the glutamine ligand and the GlnBP are through 13 hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions within the ligand binding pocket also play an important role. There are 62 van der Waals interactions Ê (<4 A) observed in the crystal structure of the GlnBP-Gln complex. These interactions are contributed by 14 residues from both domains. The aliphatic portion of the glutamine ligand is sandwiched in a hydrophobic pocket formed between Phe13 and Phe50 and accounts for 21 of the 62 van der Waals contacts (Figure 3). Interestingly, there are two additional hydrophobic regions around the binding pocket. One hydrophobic region is located between the end of strand F and the tip of helix III (residues 67 to 70) in the large domain. The other region is located between strand I and helix IV (residues 118-119). This hydrophobic region is Ê about 8.8 A long, which covers the longitudinal Ê dimension of the glutamine ligand ($6 A) and

may help orient the ligand into a favorable conformation in the initial stages of ligand binding. The intra-protein interaction around the ligand binding pocket A subset (Ala67, Gly68, Thr70, His156 and Asp157) of the amino acid residues that interact with the ligand, together with two water molecules (W1 and W2) form several intra-protein interactions that constitute a continuous network (envelope) surrounding the ligand binding pocket of GlnBP (see Figure 2(a)). The network begins with Ala67, Gly68 interacting with Thr70 via hydrogen bonding between Gly68 (O) and Thr70 (N). The side-chain (OG1) of Thr70 is involved in interactions with the side-chain of Asp157 via a solvent bridge involving W1 and W2. Since the dimensions of the envelope formed by this Ê Ê network are approximately 7.5 A wide and 9.7 A deep, it can easily accommodate the glutamine ligand. Another interesting feature of the binding pocket is the close association of Lys115 and Asp10. In the open-cleft conformation, these resiÊ dues are over 10 A apart. Conversely, in the closecleft structure the side-chains of these residues form two strong hydrogen bonds (Lys115 Ê (Nz)± Asp10 (Od2), 2.92 A and Lys115 (Nz) ±Asp10 d Ê ). Conceivably, these two residues act (O 1), 3.00 A as a door keeper that lock the glutamine ligand tightly inside the binding pocket. This phenomenon was not observed in either the LAOBP or HisJ, both of which have Leu in the corresponding

position. Therefore, we speculate that Lys115 and Asp10 play an important role in ligand binding for GlnBP by modulating the entry and exit of the ligand.

Discussion
Comparison with the ligand binding sites of other related binding proteins Among the 13 periplasmic binding proteins with known structures, ®ve of them are amino acid binding proteins. They are LIVBP (Sack et al., 1989a), LSBP (Sack et al., 1989b), LAOBP (Oh et al., 1993), HisJ (Oh et al., 1994; Yao et al., 1994) and GlnBP (Hsiao et al., 1996). GlnBP with 226 residues, is similar in size to LAOBP and HisJ, which are proteins consisting of 238 residues. LIVBP and LSBP, with 344 and 346 residues, respectively, are much larger. Figure 4 shows the structural comparisons of GlnBP with LAOBP and HisJ.

Of the small periplasmic amino acid binding proteins, LAOBP and HisJ show good sequence identity (70%) while GlnBP has less than 30% identity with either LAOBP or HisJ. One obvious sequence difference is the length of the second connecting hinge in GlnBP that shows a ®ve amino acid residues deletion at position 185. The corresponding region is residues 191 to 195 in either LAOBP or HisJ. This deletion may effect the mode of hinge bending in GlnBP and will be discussed in more detail later. In spite of the low sequence identity, a multiple-sequence alignment program (Feng & Doolittle, 1987) identi®ed 55 conserved residues among these three proteins (Table 1). Three of these conserved residues, Asp10, Arg75 and Asp157, are involved in ligand binding by forming hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions. The corresponding residues are Asp11, Arg77 and Asp161 in the LAOBP and HisJ complexes. In addition, the binding interactions between the protein and the a-amino and a-carboxyl groups of the

ligand are nearly the same in all three proteins (as shown in Figure 2). Moreover, the glutamine sidechain is sandwiched between two aromatic residues, Phe13 and Phe50, (Figure 3) in a manner similar to that observed in the LAOBP-Lys (Oh et al., 1993) and the HisJ-His complex (Oh et al., 1994; Yao et al., 1994). The corresponding residues are Tyr14, Phe52 and Tyr14, Leu52 in LAOBP and HisJ, respectively. Thus, similarities exist in ligand binding among GlnBP, LAOBP-Lys (Oh et al., 1993) and Hisj-His (Oh et al., 1994; Yao et al., 1994) complexes. In the GlnBP-Gln complex, however, Ne2 of Ê His156 forms a hydrogen bond (2.82 A) with the e1 O of the ligand. This interaction is not observed in either the HisJ-His or LAOBP-Lys complexes where the His156 equivalent Gln160 is not involved in ligand binding. This observation is also in contrast to an earlier modeling study of the GlnBP-Gln complex (Oh et al., 1994) based on the closed form structure and lysine-binding site observed on the LAOBP-Lys complex (Kang et al., 1991). In Oh's model, Ne2 of His156 does not make contact with the glutamine ligand. Solvent contribution to the ligand binding In the LAOBP-Lys complex (Figure 2(b)), there are six water molecules within the ligand binding pocket and one water molecule (W5) forms a hydrogen bond with the lysine ligand. In the HisJHis complex, two water molecules (W3 and W4) interact with the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand (Figure 2(c)). For the GlnBP-Gln complex, three water molecules (W1, W2 and W3) are observed within the binding pocket but none of them directly interacts with the glutamine ligand. The water molecules appear to stabilize the binding pocket via interactions with residues Asp10, Thr70, Lys115 and Asp157 (Figure 2(a)). Noticeably, water molecules W1 and W2 are found at similar locations in LAOBP-Lys and HisJ-His. These water molecules interact with Asp161, Thr121 and Ser72 in LAOBP, and Asp161 and Ser72 in HisJ. Thus, this water network may be

essential for ligand binding in the periplasmic amino acid binding proteins. A comparison of the solvent structure of ligandbound and ligand-free GlnBP showed no conserved solvent within the ligand binding pocket. However, two water molecules form hydrogen bonds with Lys115 and His156 in the ligand-free GlnBP. These residues are involved in ligand interactions in the ligand-bound structure with Lys115 (Nz) and His156 (Ne2) forming hydrogen bonds with Oe1 of the glutamine ligand. Ligand binding specificity Five ligand-bound periplasmic amino acid binding protein crystal structures have been elucidated. Among them, LAOBP-Lys (Oh et al., 1993), GlnBPGln (this work), and the two HisJ-His complexes (Oh et al., 1994, Yao et al., 1994) are in the closedform conformation, while the LIVBP-Leu (Sack et al., 1989a) complex is in an open-form with the leucine ligand bound to one domain. Although the four closed-form structures use similar interactions to stabilize the a-ammonium and a-carboxylate groups of the ligand zwitterion, the ligand sidechain interactions are quite varied due to the difference in length, shape, and charge of the respective ligand side-chains. The LAOBP-Lys and HisJ-His complexes utilize charged side-chains and hydroxyl groups to stabilize the a-ammonium and a-carboxylate groups of the ligand zwitterion. The basic lysine side-chain in LAOBP-Lys complex is neutralized by ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions with Asp11. In addition, the ligand is involved in hydrophobic stacking with Tyr14 and Phe52. In the HisJ-His complexes, the histidine side-chain is stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with the carbonyl oxygen of Ser69 and similar ligand hydrophobic stacking interactions are observed with Tyr14 and Leu52 (Figure 3). In the GlnBP-Gln complex, the a-ammonium and a-carboxylate groups of the ligand are stabilized by interactions with the peptide backbone of Gly68 and Gly119, the hydroxyl group of Thr70

225 induced conformational change can be described as a 35 rotation and an 8 twist centered in the middle of the ®rst conecting strand at Glu111. In LAOBP (Oh et al., 1993) the ligand-induced conformational change can be described as a 52 rotation centered on a single backbone torsion of Ala90 which is also located in the center of the ®rst connecting strand. In GlnBP, the movement of the two domains upon ligand binding can be described as a rigid-body motion about the peptide hinge connecting the two domains. The movement is centered at the carboxy terminus of strand H (residues 85 to 89) and at the amino terminus of strand N (residues 181 to 185), with the most signi®cant change observed in the f angle of Gly89 (41.1 ) and the c angle of Glu181 (34.3 ). This is in contrast to the movement observed in MMBP (Sharff et al., 1992) and LAOBP (Oh et al., 1993) which is centered in the middle of the hinge. In both GlnBP and the GlnBP-Gln complex, strong hydrogen bond interactions are observed between the two hinge strands. In ligand-free GlnBP, six hydrogen bonds exist between the two hinge strands (Table 2). After ligand binding, three additional hydrogen bonds (Tyr86 (N) ± Gln184 (Oe1), Lys87 (N) ± Gln184 (Oe1), and Ser88 (Og)± Tyr185 (OH)) are formed (Table 2). These strong hydrogen bond interactions between the hinge strands of GlnBP are rarely seen in other periplasmic binding proteins. They might explain why the rigid-body motion is centered at the end instead of the middle of the hinge, as observed in MMBP (Sharff et al., 1992) and LAOBP (Oh et al., 1993). A functional role for the flexible hinges All periplasmic binding proteins are composed of two globular domains connected by two or three peptide strands. The functional role of these connecting segments aside from conferring ¯exibility to the molecule, has been the topic of considerable interest. For example, in MMBP (Spurlino et al., 1991; Sharff et al., 1992), the side-chain carboxylate Oe2 of Glu111, which is located in the middle of hinge segment, hydrogen bonds with the C2 hydroxyl of the bound maltose. This represents a Ê 4 A shift of the Glu111 side-chain as a result of sugar binding and Sharff et al. (1992) proposed that

and the charged side-chains of Arg75 and Asp157. The neutral ligand side-chain is stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions with the side-chains of Asp10, His156, Lys115 and the carbonyl oxygen of Ala67. In addition, hydrophobic interactions are also observed between the ligand and Phe13 and Phe50. Thus, in GlnBP a total of 13 protein-ligand interactions, nine with the ligand backbone and four with the ligand side-chain, plus hydrophobic interactions with aromatic residues help stabilize the ligand within the binding pocket. Analysis of ligand binding in the LAOBP-Lys and HisJ-His complexes (Oh et al., 1994) suggested that residues 11 and 52 play an important role in determining the ligand speci®city for these two proteins. In LAOBP, Asp11 is involved in hydrogen bonding with Nz of the ligand side-chain while Phe52 is involved in hydrophobic stacking interactions with the ligand. In the HisJ-His complex, Asp11 does not interact with the ligand while Leu52 is involved in similar hydrophobic interactions with the ligand. Since the residue 52 differs in both size and charge between these two proteins and represents the only substitution found within the binding pocket, it was postulated that Asp11 and Phe/Leu52 were involved in determining and modulating the difference in af®nity between LAOBP and HisJ for their respect ligands. The corresponding residues (Asp10 and Phe50) in the GlnBP-Gln complex are conserved (Table 1) and involved in ligand interactions similar to those observed for Asp11 and Phe52 in the LAOBP-Lys complex. Due to the dissimilarity between the ligand lysine and glutamine, the Asp10 and Phe50 of GlnBP do not appear to determine ligand binding speci®city in GlnBP. Instead, we propose that ligand speci®city is determined by Lys115 and His156 that are unique to GlnBP. These residues interact with Oe1, which is unique to the neutral ligand amide side-chain. This postulation is consistent with the results from earlier proton NMR studies (Shen et al., 1989a,b; Hing et al., 1994) which demonstrated that His156 and Lys115 participate in hydrogen bonding and stabilizing the glutamine ligand. The crystals of GlnBP-Gln were grown at pH 4.6 (0.1 M sodium acetate). Both Lys115 and His156 are totally protonated and two hydrogen bonds are formed between the ligand (Oe1) and His156 (Ne2) in addition to Lys115 (Nz). These interactions might play a key role in determining GlnBP ligand speci®city. This idea is supported to some extent by the fact that although unliganded GlnBP crystals could be crystallized at pH 8.5 (Hsiao et al., 1996), attempts to crystallize the GlnBP-Gln complex at high pH, where Lys115 and His156 are not protonated, were unsuccessful. Ligand-induced conformational change As in other periplasmic binding proteins, a large conformational change accompanies ligand binding. In MMBP (Sharff et al., 1992), the ligand-

226 ligand-induced movement of Glu111 may be the triggering mechanism for the closure of the two domains around the bound oligosaccharide. In the GlnBP-Gln complex, the hinge strands do not directly interact with the bound glutamine, but two hydrogen bond networks are formed between strand N and the bound ligand, Gln183 (Ne2)± Thr70 (Og1) ±Gln (OT) and Tyr185 (OH) ± Asp157 (Od1)± Gln (N). The ®rst hydrogen bond network connects the large domain to the hinge while the second connects the small domain to the hinge, both via interaction with the glutamine ligand. Thus, these hydrogen bond networks may play an important role in the conformational cascade which accompanies ligand binding in GlnBP. In addition, Tyr185 (Ce1) from the second hinge segment forms a strong van der Waals interaction Ê (3.6 A) with the main-chain nitrogen of the glutamine ligand. Since this interaction is not observed in other amino acid binding proteins, Tyr185 may play a signi®cant role in the mechanism of conformational change which accompanies ligand binding in GlnBP. We suggest that interactions between Tyr185 and the ligand initiates hinge bending. The binding pocket-ligand interactions via Tyr185 may be the triggering mechanism that results in the closure of both domains around the ligand to form a stable close-cleft conformation. Comparison with the nuclear magnetic resonance studies of GlnBP-Gln complex A model of the GlnBP-Gln complex has been proposed by Hing et al. (1994). The model is built upon the structure of ligand-free GlnBP (Hsiao et al., 1996) and results obtained from rotationalecho double-resonance (REDOR) solid state NMR with isotopic labeling (15N and 19F), followed by molecular dynamics simulations. The model demonstrated the interactions of His156 and Lys115 with the glutamine ligand. In the model by Hing, the distance between Vall4 and Ile139 in the Ê GlnBP-Gln complex was reported to be 10.7 A as Ê compared to 14.9 A in the ligand-free crystal structure. In the crystal structure of the GlnBP-Gln Ê complex, a distance of 9.8 A has been observed between Val14 and Ile139. The recognition surface for membrane complex It is believed that the interaction between a given periplasmic binding protein and its corresponding membrane-bound protein components are essential for the active transport of a particular ligand across the cytoplasmic membrane (Ames, 1986; Furlong, 1987). Chemical modi®cation (Weiner & Heppel, 1971; Hunt & Hong, 1983), molecular genetic (Hunt & Hong, 1983), and NMR (Shen et al., 1989b) studies have shown that two tryptophan residues (Trp32 and Trp220) are likely to be involved in (or sensitive to) the interactions with the membrane-bound protein components of the glutamine transport system.

Structure of Glutamine-binding Protein

From our analysis of the GlnBP-Gln complex, Ê Ê Ê Trp32 and Trp220 lie 17.5 A and 18 A, 21.3 A and Ê Ê Ê 17 A, and 18.5 A and 19 A, respectively, from the ligand, the hinge (Gly89) and the Asp22 loop. In addition, the solvent accessibility of Trp32 is minimal in both forms. The solvent accessibility of Ê Trp220 in both liganded (33 A2) and unliganded Ê 2) forms is also low. Thus, our structural (21 A results indicate that Trp32 and Trp220 are most unlikely, as previously thought, directly involved in interactions with the membrane-bound protein components of the glutamine transport system. Oh et al. (1993) have proposed that an exposed region of LAOBP (or HisJ), formed by residues Asp144, Ser148 and Arg154 of an a-helix in the small domain and residues 18 to 26 of a b-loop that protrudes from the large domain and is close to the opening of the binding cleft, may be involved in interactions with the membrane-bound components of the lysine or histidine transport systems. Although GlnBP does not use the same membrane-bound transport components, the sequence alignment (Table 1) and structural comparisons (Figure 4) show that the residues of these ``exposed regions'' are more highly conserved or similar among GlnBP, LAOBP and HisJ. Structurally, in the GlnBP-Gln complex, helix V (Asp140, Met144 and Arg150) and the b-loop (residues 18 to 24) are located in an environment similar to that observed in the LAOBP-Lys and the HisJ-His complexes. In addition, the solvent accessibility surface areas of Ê these residues are high, 151 A2 for Arg150 and Ê 122 A2 for Asp22. Thus, the structure of the GlnBPGln complex supports Oh's proposal but the exact nature of these interactions must await further biochemical and/or structural analysis.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification and crystallization The puri®cation of GlnBP from E. coli has been described (Hsiao et al., 1994). The crystals of the GlnBPGln complex were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 C from 3 ml droplets of protein solution (20 mg/ml) containing 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mM CdCl2 and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6). Needle-like crystals appeared in about two days and grew to a size of 1.0 mm Â 0.15 mm Â 0.1 mm in ten days. The crystals gave unit cell dimensions of Ê Ê Ê a  66.7 A, b  91.0 A, c  34.7 A, and a  b  g  90.0 . The systematic absences and Laue-symmetry of the diffraction pattern (2/mmm) indicate that the space group Ê is P212121. The crystals diffract to 1.94 A resolution and contain one molecule of the GlnBP-Gln complex per asymmetric unit. The value of VM (Matthews, 1968) is Ê calculated to be 2.11 A3/dalton and the solvent content is estimated to be 42 %. Data collection and processing For X-ray diffraction analysis, a crystal was mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary containing a small amount of mother liquid to prevent dehydration, and

then superimposed with the large and the small domains of the HisJ-His complex, respectively, by least-squares ®tting based on the conserved residues in each domain. The search model was then placed in an arti®cial tricliÊ nic cell of dimensions a  b  c  60 A, a  b  g  90 . Ê Data between 8.0 and 4.0 A and a Patterson radius of Ê 17 A were used for all rotation and translation function calculations. From the rotation search, the highest peak at a  103.88 , b  38.85 and g  353.92 ,with a correlation coef®cient of 17.7 (highest), corresponded to the correct solution. A unique solution to the translation function was obtained at x  0.061, y  0.158 and z  0.453, and had the highest correlation coef®cient (34.7) and the lowest R factor (48.8) of the solution set. Ten cycles of rigid body re®nement (FITFUN) were performed yielding the ®nal solution of a  105.72 , b  39.15 and g  351.72 ; x  0.062, y  0.156 and z  0.454 that had a correlation coef®cient of 37.4 and an R-factor of 47.1. The structure was re®ned in steps using X-PLOR V3.1 (Brunger et al., 1992a). In the ®rst step, a rigid-body re®nement was carried out using data from 8 to Ê 2.8 A resolution. The R factor after the rigid-body re®nement was 43.9% and the Rfree value was 47.2%. The second step, positional re®nement by conjugate gradient Ê minimization, reduced the R-factor to 29.9% at 2.8 A. At this point, the (2|Fo| À |Fc|) and (|Fo| À |Fc|) difference electron density maps were calculated to recover the omitted hinge residues and determine the location of the ligand. These maps clearly showed the missing hinge residues and the glutamine ligand. After building the missing hinge residues and ligand into the model, a simulated annealing (SA) re®nement was carried out. The SA re®nement started at 3000 K and was cooled to 300 K in 25 K steps calculated every 50 dynamic steps and converged to give an R-factor of 23.3%. At this point, the entire molecule was rebuilt using TOMFRODO (Cambillau & Horjales 1987) by examination of ``SA-omit'' difference Fourier maps. Twenty omit maps were calculated in which ten residue regions ($5% of total) of the molecule were omitted from the SA re®neÊ ment. The re®nement was extended to 1.94 A by gradually increasing the resolution of the data in four

sealed with diffusion pump oil. Data were collected from a Raxis-II image plate system operated at 50 kV and 80 mA. DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993) was used to index, integrate, and scale the data. A total of 65,773 observations were recorded and reduced to give 15,110 unique re¯ections with an Rmerge of 8.2% based on intensity between symmetry-related re¯ections. The ®nal data set used for the re®nement is summarized in Table 3. The merged data set corresponds to 91.1% of the possÊ ible data to 1.94 A resolution (82.5% completion in the outermost shell). Structure determination and refinement The structure of the GlnBP-Gln complex was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The search model was obtained by molecular modeling studies based on the ligand-free open form structure of GlnBP in which the two domains were positioned in an orientation similar to that observed in the LAOBP-Lys and HisJ-His (Oh et al., 1993, 1994; Yao et al., 1994) closed-form structures. During this operation, the GlnBP molecule was split into its two individual domains and the hinge residues (hinge I, 85 to 89; hinge II, 181 to 185) were removed. The two domains were

resolution shells. After extending the resolution of the data, the R-factor converged to 23%. During the course of the re®nement, Ramachandran plots (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) were periodically examined and residues with unfavorable main-chain conformation were rebuilt. Solvent molecules were identi®ed from difference Fourier maps and included in the model if the peak height was above 2.5s and the peak was located within Ê 2.5 to 3.5 A of potential donor or acceptor atoms (O and N) of the protein. During the re®nement, the occupancies of these water molecules (oxygen atoms) were ®xed at 1.0, and their positions and temperature factors were re®ned. Solvent molecules exhibiting temperature factors Ê above 50 A2 after several cycles of re®nement were excluded from the model. The ®nal re®nement process converged to an R-factor of 20.8% for the 12,765 re¯ections (>2s(F)) from Ê 6.0 to 1.94 A. The Rfree value (Brunger, 1992b) for the 1448 randomly selected re¯ections (2s(F)) that were excluded from the re®nement process was 30.2%. The model has good stereochemistry with r.m.s. deviations Ê from ideal bond distances and bond angles of 0.014 A and 1.45 , respectively. The ®nal model of GlnBP-Gln complex contains 1878 non-hydrogen atoms, including 122 oxygen atoms from water molecules. The 2|Fo| À |Fc| omit density maps around the glutamine ligand with the ®nal re®ned model superimposed on it are shown in Figure 5.
