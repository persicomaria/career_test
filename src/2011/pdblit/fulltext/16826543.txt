The structure of an O6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) from the thermophile Methanococcus jannaschii has been determined using multinuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The structure is similar to homologs from other organisms that have been determined by crystallography, with some variation in the N-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is more highly conserved in both sequence and structure. Regions of the protein show broadening, reflecting conformational flexibility that is likely related to function.

INTRODUCTION
The survival and propagation of an organism depend on the integrity and faithful replication of its DNA. Modifications or alterations to DNA can be caused by external sources (UV radiation or chemical agents), endogenous metabolites, and naturally occurring errors in incorporation of nucleotides during DNA replication. Each may result in deleterious effects on the cell. To avoid such effects, a number of DNArepair systems have evolved to prevent these potentially harmful modifications from being propagated during DNA replication: base-excision repair (BER); nucleotide excision repair (NER); and direct reversal (DR) repair. These DNArepair systems are highly conserved among all branches of life. While the first two systems involve multiple enzymes to cleave, excise, and replace the damaged DNA, DR involves single enzymes that can repair the damaged base without removing nucleotides.1 ­ 3 A prominent protein that functions in DR is O6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) or alkyguanine alkyltransferase (AGT). Alkylating agents such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) covalently modify DNA by alkylating the N7 and O6 position of guanine, and the O4 position of thymine. Although N7 -alkylated guanine is the predominant alkylation product, this modification is relatively harmless, as it does not affect the natural base pairing. In contrast, O6 -methylguanine (O6 MG), a much less common product, is a mutagenic, carcinogenic, and potentially cytotoxic lesion.4,5 Incorporation of the methyl group leads to a preference for pairing of the modified guanosine with thymine rather than its normal Watson­Crick partner cytosine. This greatly increases the

chance of incorporation of thymine opposite O6 MG during subsequent replication, resulting in a GC ! AT mutation (Fig. 1).6 MGMT repairs O6 MG, and to a lesser extent O4 methylthymine, by covalently transferring the methyl (or alkyl) group to the protein. A cysteine residue in the protein acts as a nucleophile and displaces the methyl group on the guanine, restoring the original base. Once the protein is methylated there is no mechanism to dealkylate the protein, thus, MGMT is known as a `suicide' repair protein; one protein molecule is used to repair one alkyl lesion.7 Although MGMT protects against alkylation-induced carcinogenesis, much interest in MGMT stems from the fact that alkylating and chloroethylating agents are used as chemotherapeutic treatments for their cytotoxicity. Although the mechanism for alkylation-induced cell death is not completely understood (it appears to involve the mismatch repair-MMR system), alkylating agents do precipitate early cell death, and are used in the treatment of some forms of cancer.8,9 By repairing O6 MG and other products formed by these agents, MGMT interferes with the cell-killing effects of treatments. Thus, effective inhibitors of MGMT are of great interest; one in particular, O6 -benzylguanine (O6 BG) has been used in clinical trials.9 Investigation of the kinetics of repair by MGMT reveals that in both human MGMT (hMGMT) and Escherichia coli AdaC (the C-terminal domain of the Ada protein which has MGMT activity) repair of a single O6 MG lesion within single or double-stranded DNA is extremely fast, 105 ­108 M 1 s 1 , approaching the diffusion limited rate.10 ­ 12 The repair process is facilitated by the physical interaction of the protein and DNA: incubation of the free O6 MG base with hMGMT results in slow demethylation, but the addition of nonmethylated DNA to the free base/hMGMT mixture restores the fast kinetics.13 While there may be some subtle differences in repair rate depending on the surrounding sequence, it is clear MGMT has little sequence specificity for

repairing O6 MG, as might be expected from a lesion that could occur anywhere in the genome.14 ­ 18 Binding constant studies put dissociation constants (Kd for MGMT­DNA complexes in the low (0.5­20) micromolar range for both methylated and unmethylated DNA.10,11,19 ­ 21 This moderate affinity for DNA and low preference for methylated over unmethylated DNA in particular may be reflected in the low sequence specificity of repair. As indicated above, the most highly studied MGMT proteins are hMGMT and AdaC. Although the proteins are equivalent in their overall function, some differences exist in their repair and binding characteristics. For instance, hMGMT is believed to bind cooperatively to DNA, while AdaC does not seem to.10,15 In addition, hMGMT is inactivated by free O6 -benzylguanine (O6 BG), while AdaC is not. There are also differences in the rate of repair for different adducts by these proteins.12,20 Some of these differences reflect changes at the amino-acid sequence level; a tryptophan in AdaC located at an equivalent position as a serine in hMGMT prevents O6 BG from diffusing into the active site and inactivating AdaC.21 Other differences may reflect evolutionary changes in the way MGMT carries out its activity. For example, the Ada protein is part of the adaptive response system in E. coli. Ada is a two-domain protein; the 10 kD N-terminal domain (AdaN) demethylates innocuous methylphosphotriesters with a cysteine residue, and the 19 kD C-terminal domain (AdaC) has MGMT activity. The adaptive response system appears to be a unique feedback mechanism within bacteria. Upon methylation, AdaN turns into a transcriptional activator of the Ada gene and other genes involved in DNA-repair, including, AlkA, AlkB, and OGT (another protein with MGMT activity).6 Although there are feedback mechanisms for the induction of MGMT expression in human cells, only bacteria appear to have fused MGMT and a transcriptional activator.3,9,22 The third branch of organisms, archaea, along with eukaryotes, contain the single domain MGMT protein. This is consistent with the idea that certain genes from archaeal sources resemble more their eukaryotic than prokaryotic counterparts.3,23 MGMT is found in all branches of organisms, bacteria, archaea, and eukarya, emphasizing its importance in maintaining the integrity of the genome. Comparisons between the various branches are instructive about the processes that govern protein evolution and the different characteristics that determine reactivity. Here we report the first

solution structure of an MGMT protein from the thermophilic organism Methanococcus jannaschii. Comparisons of the sequence, structure, and other characteristics of this protein, MJ1529, are made to those of other MGMT proteins whose structures have been solved. The structure of MJ1529 reveals a two-domain protein, highly similar in structure to hMGMT, AdaC, and MGMT from Pyrococcus kodakarensis (pMGMT) particularly in the domain known to be involved in DNA-binding, the C-terminal domain. The structure also reveals some areas of disorder in both the N- and C-terminal domains, the latter of which may have implications for how MGMT proteins recognize and accommodate lesions in DNA in the active site.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Although sequence homology strongly indicates that MJ1529 is an MGMT protein, the activity of the protein was verified in two ways. First, it is known that the addition of free O6 MG base to MGMT results in irreversible methylation of the protein.13 Complete methylation of MJ1529 by this reaction was verified by mass spectrometry. Additionally, MJ1529 repaired O6 MG within double-stranded oligonucleotides, as shown by a restriction endonuclease cleavage assay (see Section on Experimental).24

Assignment and structure calculations
The 1 H­ 15 N HSQC spectrum of MJ1529 is shown in Fig. 2. The peaks are labeled with the one letter amino-acid code and protein sequence number. All backbone amide resonances were assigned except for I24, S141, and the last seven amino acids of the protein, which are structurally disordered. There are extra resonances in the HSQC that could not be assigned, some of which likely represent proteolysis products. Some residues gave weaker cross peaks; these arise from amide protons in residues 60­65, 93­94, and 152­156, which are close to each other in space and are somewhat less well defined in the protein structure. This likely indicates some conformational flexibility in this region. The amide proton of E61 appears to shift in different spectra, and an FHSQC spectrum taken with high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio reveal three weak peaks in the spectral region of E61. The amide peak of Tyr 140, a fully conserved residue in the C-terminal domain, is also weak and side-chain protons could not be unambiguously assigned for this residue. An example of data from a three-dimensional spectrum acquired from 15 N labeled MJ1529 is shown in Fig. 3.

All of the restraints included in structure calculations and the statistics of the lowest energy structures are shown in Table 1. In addition to NOE assignments, JHN H couplings constants, dihedral angle restraints (from TALOS), hydrogen bonds, and residual dipolar couplings were used.25 NOE assignment was aided by the automatic assignment programs CYANA and ARIA. Final calculations incorporating residual dipolar couplings were performed using CNS.26 ­ 28 An ensemble of the ten lowest energy structures for MJ1529 is shown in Fig. 4. The ensemble reveals that MJ1529 is a two-domain protein with an / fold. The N-terminal domain consists of a three-stranded antiparallel  sheet, 1 3, a largely disordered region with some -helical characteristics (helix a), and helix b. Overall, the N-terminus is somewhat less well defined than the C-terminus of the protein. The turn between 1 and 2 lacks long-range contacts, and no assignments could be unambiguously made for residue I24, near the end of 3. The C-terminal domain

consists of helix c, helix d, helix e, helix f, helix g, 5 and 6. Helices e and f form a helix-turn-helix (hth) motif, a wellestablished DNA-binding motif. Between the hth region and the terminal helix is a `wing'. The wing, or helix-turnwing motif, is a structural element also implicated in DNA binding.29,30

Structural comparisons
The structure of MJ1529 can be compared with the structures of other MGMT proteins that have been solved by X-ray crystallography; AdaC (PDB entry 1sfe), hMGMT (in the unmethylated, methylated, and benzylated forms) (1eh6), and pMGMT (from the hyperthermophile P. kodakarensis1mgt).21,32 ­ 34 A structure-based sequence alignment reveals that although there is very little sequence homology in the N-terminal domains of the proteins (even for the thermostable MJ1529 and pMGMT, which are 35% identical over 100 residues), all the structures reveal the three-stranded

In hMGMT, a zinc atom binds the side chains in 1, 3, and a loop, but no other metal ions have been observed or their presence inferred in the other structures.21 1 in MJ1529 is shorter than in the other structures and the sheet has a less pronounced roll. The region corresponding to the sheet and the disordered region before the beginning of helix b has approximately ten fewer residues than the corresponding region in pMGMT, reflecting the difference in their respective sequence lengths (167 vs 174). The shortest MGMT proteins identified to date are also from thermostable organisms.35 A putative MGMT protein from Thermatoga maritima, identified through a Blast search using the MJ1529 sequence, contains just 139 residues, with the alignment beginning at the start of helix b in MGMT.36

Similar residues are highlighted in bold, completely conserved residues are noted with an asterisk. The active-site cysteine is shown in the black highlighted box.

N-terminus
The greatest topological differences in the structures occur after the  sheet. In both AdaC and pMGMT, the -sheet is followed by an -helix. No density is observed in that portion of hMGMT crystal structure.21,32 ­ 34 In the structure of MJ1529, the region corresponding to this helix is poorly defined. Only a single amide proton, I31, is significantly protected from solvent exchange, compared to a much higher percentage of protection in other areas of secondary

structure. HN­HN NOE cross peaks indicative of an -helix are observed for amides 29­35 as well as an NOE from amide of M35 to the H of F32, also indicative of helix formation. The integrity of the corresponding helix in pMGMT is maintained by two intrahelix ion pairs (salt links between side chains of residues i and i C 3/4) that span the rather long, 16-residue helix, and are speculated to contribute to the thermostability of the protein.34 Comparison of the sequences of the two thermophiles reveals that MJ1529 has only one potential

intrahelix ion pair (R27­E30), and this occurs in the transition from 3 to the disordered region. In addition, this region in MGMT is both shorter and more hydrophobic in nature. There are two phenylalanine residues, F32 and F34, for which only -protons could be assigned owing to the particularly high overlap of the phenylalanine aromatic protons. These residues are near I24, for which no assignments could be made, and it would seem likely these hydrophobic residues would interact. For those residues whose heteronuclear T2 values could be measured in this region, R28, F34, D36, G37, D38, and V39, all had elevated values (>0.3 s) indicating this region may be dynamic. Following this region is helix b, which is oriented similarly in AdaC, MJ1529 and pMGMT, but lies at a slightly different angle in hMGMT. It is not clear whether the N-terminal domain serves a biological function, but data indicate it contributes to structural stability. This is consistent with chemical shift mapping of DNA-binding to AdaC, which reveals that few amide resonances shift in the N-terminal domain during DNA-binding.19 In addition, the lack of sequence conservation or length in the N-terminal domain (despite similar structural elements) also indicates it exists as a cap for the DNA-binding domain.

C-terminus
The C-terminal domains of the MGMT proteins are highly superimposable. This domain consists of helices d­g, 5

and 6. Superposition of this region of a minimized average structure of MJ1529 with pMGMT, AdaC, and hMGMT, ° shows a C rmsd of 1.8 A (Fig. 6(c)). The similarity of these domains correlates with the higher level of sequence homology in this portion of the protein; all 19 of the absolutely conserved residues occur in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 5). The sequence PCHRV, which contains the active-site cysteine, is the signature sequence that identifies potential MGMT proteins; all proteins that have MGMT activity contain this stretch of residues in their C-termini. Mutagenesis studies on these fully conserved residues implicate them in DNA-binding or active-site integrity.40,41 As in the other MGMT structures, the active-site cysteine in MJ1529 is located in a 310 helix, buried within the protein. It was first thought that MGMT underwent a substantial conformational change in order to place the cysteine in close enough contact with O6 MG to repair it.33 A much more elegant explanation, however, was derived from the studies of other DNA-repair proteins, such as glycosylases and endonucleases. It was revealed through cocrystal structures of these proteins and DNA that nucleotides could be `flippedout' of the double helix into the active site of the protein.42 This mode of action by MGMT was recently verified by cocrystal structures of mutant and wild-type hMGMT in complex with O6 -methylguanine containing duplex DNA, or DNA containing a modified base respectively.43,44 The C-terminal domain of MJ1529 includes an hth (helices e and f), which contains fully conserved residues Y99

(helix e) and R111, A112, and V113 (helix f) (Fig. 7(a)). In both MJ1529 and the crystal structures, R111 at the base of helix f (the recognition helix) is exposed and is in a position to interact with negatively charged DNA. In the cocrystal structures, this arginine is inserted into the DNA base stack, replacing the space left by the extra-helical guanine base and stabilizing the base-flipped conformation (akin to other DNA-repair enzymes that use amino acids to promote base-flipping.45 ­ 47 ) The other small hydrophobic residues in helix f, A112 and G114, are proposed to make sequenceindependent contacts with DNA, which is illustrated with the cocrystal structures. Interestingly, the recognition helix of MGMT binds deeply in the minor groove of DNA; in all other hth-containing proteins whose mode of DNA-binding has been elucidated, the recognition helix binds in the major groove.

A model of MJ1529 bound to DNA based on the cocrystal structures reveals that the majority of the interactions between the protein and the phosphodiester backbone are likely mediated by small residues, explaining the lack of sequence specificity for repair. In addition to the hydrophobic residues in the recognition helix, N107, T108, and S109 in the turn of the hth are poised to interact with the DNA backbone, as is T98 at the start of helix e (Fig. 7(a), (b)). Residues within the wing are also likely to interact with the DNA. A surface potential plot shows the charge complementarity of the recognition helix and wing with DNA (Fig. 7(c)). Interaction of this region of the protein with DNA is also consistent with chemical shift mapping data on AdaC, in which significant shifts of amide peaks upon titration with DNA occurred in helix e and helix f, and the wing residues.19,34

The space between the wing and the recognition helix creates a pocket for the flipped-out base (Fig. 7(a)). In MJ1529 and the crystal structures, conserved Y99 of helix e sits at the base of the pocket with its hydroxyl poised to form a hydrogen bond with the N3 of guanine. The back of the hydrophobic pocket is lined with wing residues V131 and V132, and L117 from helix f, whose corresponding residues in the cocrystal structures interact with the flipped-out base. In the crystal structures, the residues corresponding to invariant Y140 and S141 in MJ1529 stack against and form an amide hydrogen bond to the flipped base, respectively. The area around these residues in MJ1529 is not well defined, and represents the greatest difference in the backbone C-termini rmsd between MJ1529 and the crystal structures. In the crystal structures, Y140 is pointing in toward the hydrophobic pocket. In MJ1529, the average structure has Y140 pointing out of the pocket. It is not clear whether this represents the true conformation of Y140; the amide cross peak of this residue was weak in the HSQC, and no side-chain atoms could be positively assigned. Correspondingly, none of the resonances for S141 could be assigned. While this limited the NOE assignments in this area, these features are also consistent with the flexibility in this region. Support for flexibility in the wing is also present in the crystal structures. In pMGMT, the residues in the wing have higher B factors than other structured areas of the protein.34 In addition, comparison of an hMGMT/DNA complex with a modified base flipped into the active site and an hMGMT/DNA complex with a thymine bound partially in the active site shows that the greatest differences between these protein structures is in the position of the last helix and wing, which the authors attribute to an inherent flexibility that allows for binding a wide range of lesions.44 The active site of MJ1529 is constructed similarly to those of the other structures. The side chain of invariant H129 is in proximity to invariant E154 whose side chain interacts with that of invariant R130 (Fig. 7(d)). It is proposed that this hydrogen-bonding network results in deprotonation of C128, generating the nucleophile. One interaction that could not be detected (not likely because of its absence but because of data limitations) is a hydrogen bond between the side chains of invariant N120 and C128. It is this interaction that is broken by alkylation, and results in a subtle structural change that destabilizes the protein, and in the case of hMGMT, signals the protein for ubiquitindependent degradation.46 The overall structure of MJ1529 is very similar to the structures of pMGMT, hMGMT, and AdaC. The largest differences occur in the N-terminal regions of the proteins, in which the secondary structural elements of MJ1529 are shorter than in the other protein structures, and residues 29­39 are much less structured than in pMGMT and AdaC. It is interesting to note, however, that the corresponding region in hMGMT is not present in the crystal structure, implying some flexibility in this region. Other possibly dynamic regions include residues 60­65, which have weak amide resonances, and do not superimpose well in the structure.

The C-terminal domains are all highly superimposable, as expected from the level of sequence conservation. In all of the structures, the active-site cysteine is buried within the protein, and invariant residues from the hth and wing are exposed and poised to interact with the DNA. The greatest difference in the C-termini between MJ1529 and the crystal structures is at the C-terminal tip of the wing, which is not well defined in the NMR structure and is consistent with flexibility in this region. The two thermophilic proteins share many characteristics at the sequence level. These include helix capping by proline residues, the pattern of i, i C 3/4 charged side-chain residues that are shown to form intra and interhelix ion pairs in the KOD structure, and a short deletion in the loop between helices e and f, all of which may contribute to the thermostability of the proteins.34

EXPERIMENTAL Protein expression, purification, and NMR sample preparation
A clone of MJ1529 in pet21a (Novagen) was kindly provided by Hisao Yokota, and was transformed into BL21(DE3) with plasmid pACYC (Stratagene) expressing lac repressor. Transformants were grown in 2 ml cultures of LB containing ampicillin and kanamyacin and used to inoculate 1 l of LB, 1 l of M9 with 15 NH4 Cl (15 N labeled), or 1 l of M9 with 15 NH4 Cl and 13 C glucose (15 N/13 C labeled). One milligram of thiamine, and trace metals were added to M9 growths. Cells were grown to an o.d. of 0.6­0.8, whereupon 50 mg/l of IPTG was added to induce expression. Cells were allowed to grow for 5­6 h more and harvested by centrifugation. Harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT and 200 µM PMSF, then were sonicated on ice, and the insoluble matter was spun down by high-speed centrifugation. The supernatant was placed in a 60­70 ° C water bath for approximately 1 /2 h to precipitate most E. coli proteins, then the solution was again centrifuged and the supernatant was applied to an SP Sepharose column, and washed extensively with 50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, until the detector absorbance returned to baseline levels. A salt gradient from 200 to 650 mM NaCl (300 ml total) was run, with MJ1529 eluting at approximately 450 mM NaCl. Typical yields were ¾10 mg/l for LB and ¾8 mg/l for M9 preparations. The molecular weight of the purified protein was verified by mass spectrometry. After the purification, MJ1529 was dialyzed into 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.02% NaN3 and concentrated to 0.4­0.8 mM in Amicon centrifugal filters. For the residual dipolar coupling experiments, the protein was dialyzed into a low salt buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.7, 50 mM NaCl or 200 mM NaCl) before being diluted with bicelle stocks.48 The resulting protein solutions were 150­250 µM, but transferring assignments from different salt and different pH solutions was not difficult.

MGMT activity assay
O6 methylguanine was purchased from Sigma and incubated with MJ1529 overnight at 37 ° C. After reverse-phase HPLC, the protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry revealing that the protein had become fully methylated. During the reaction with the free O6 MG base, it was noted that protein precipitate formed, which agrees with the findings that MGMT proteins are destabilized by methylation.49 To verify MGMT activity, a single O6 -methylguanine lesion was incorporated within a double-stranded piece of DNA containing multiple restriction endonuclease sites. The O6 -methylguanine containing strand was fluorescently labeled with 6-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX). The lesion was incorporated in the middle of a PvuII site (CAGL CTG), which cannot cleave if the central guanine is methylated. Thus, when the protein is incubated with the modified oligo the lesion is repaired, and reaction with PvuII results in the cleavage of the oligo, which can be quantified by running the DNA on a gel and measuring the fluorescence.24 The oligos were ordered (purified by HPLC) from Synthegen (Texas) and designed as follows, with the G* representing O6 -methylguanine: Hex-GCCCGGCCAGL CTGCAGCG with CGCTGCAGCTGGCCGGGC. The dried oligos were dissolved separately in 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 33 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. The oligos contained a PvuII site and an HaeIII site used as an internal control. The fluorescently labeled oligo and an excess of the complementary oligo were combined and heated at 90 ° C for 2 to 3 min and then allowed to anneal at room temperature overnight. The subsequent solution was aliquoted and frozen at 20 ° C for further use. 10­20 pmols of the annealed oligo were incubated either without or with various concentrations of purified MJ1529 in 150 µl total volume of buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. The reactions were incubated from 2 to 12 h at 37 ° C, and for 2 h at 55 ° C. The DNA was extracted by vortexing with an equal volume of phenol (50): chloroform (49): isoamyl alcohol (1) and keeping the aqueous layer (repeated twice), followed by chloroform (99): isoamyl alcohol (1) extraction. To the retained fraction 150 µl of 0.5 M NaOAc pH 5 was added, followed by 25­30 µl of 1 mg/ml tRNA, to help precipitation of the DNA. To this mixture, 0.3 ml of cold 100% ethanol was added and the mixture was allowed to sit overnight at 20 ° C. The following day the ethanol mixture was spun in a microcentrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 4 min and the ethanol was poured off. The pellet was dried in a speed vacuum and then redissolved in 20 µl buffer appropriate for incubation with PvuII or HaeIII. The restriction endonuclease reactions were allowed to proceed for 1­2 h, stopped with 10 µl formamide (containing 20 mM EDTA), and heated at 95 ° C for 5 min to separate the DNA strands, and then loaded on a pre-run 20% acrylamide gel containing 7 M Urea in TBE buffer. The gels were imaged with a Typhoon Fluoroimager using excitation of the HEX oligo at 535 nm and emission at 556 nm. The assay results reveal that MJ1529 does repair O6 -methylguanine within double-stranded oligonucleotides.

Inter-residue connectivity was established by analysis of HNCA,50 CBCA(CO)NH,51 15 N edited NOESY-HSQC,52 HBHA(CO)NH,53 and 15 N edited TOCSY-HSQC54 spectra with Watergate for solvent suppression.52 Intra-residue connections were identified using 15 N edited NOESY-HSQC, 15 N edited TOCSY-HSQC, and 13 C edited HCCH TOCSY55 (D2 O) spectra. Carbonyl carbons were assigned with an HNCO experiment. 3 JNH coupling constants were determined by peak intensity analysis of an HNHA experiment56 and converted to coupling restraints in the program NMRVIEW.57 Hydrogen bonds were inferred from analysis of secondary structure indicated by HN­HN connections in the 15 N edited NOESY-HSQC, and D2 O- exchange experiments, in which the protein solution was lyophilized and redissolved in 100% D2 O and monitored by successive Fast 1 H­ 15 N HSQC (FHSQC) experiments for the next several hours.58 Peaks that had a long lifetime were inferred to be involved in hydrogen bonds, and when consistent with other secondary structural indications, were used as restraints during structure calculations. Aromatic resonances were assigned using a 1 H­ 1 H NOESY on labeled protein, 1 H­ 1 H TOCSY, 15 N edited NOESY-HSQC, 4D HMQC-NOE (D2 O), and aromatic 1 H­ 13 C HSQC spectra (CT-HSQC, HMQC, etc.).59,60 Because of the high degeneracy in the chemical shifts of the phenylalanine aromatic protons and carbons, a 13 C­ 15 N labeled, 12 C, 14 N-labeled phenylalanine sample was made by introducing unlabeled phenylalanine to a minimal media growth (known as `reverse isotopic labeling'). Using this strategy, only tyrosine and histidine signals are found in the aromatic region of spectra relying on 13 C-labeling. Analogously, 12 C-filtered experiments will yield signals only from phenylalanine, without the line broadening associated from proton attachment to isotopically labeled carbons.60 2D CT-HSQC, 2D-HMQC, and 3D 13 C NOESY spectra were run, placing the carrier at 125 ppm to maximize the aromatic contributions to the spectra. At least one -proton resonance for each phenylalanine was assigned. A 1D of the aromatic region verified the extent of the overlap and also some broad peaks, indicating the presence of some dynamic regions of the protein, consistent with the structure presented here. Two of the phenylalanines, F32 and F34, are in a largely unstructured portion of the protein, as are the aromatic residues after residue 160. Stereospecific assignments of methyl groups were generated by making a 10% labeled 13 C sample and running a CT-HSQC experiment.61,62 NMR data were processed on Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstations using Felix 97 or NMRPipe,63 and visualized using the program NMRVIEW. The chemical shift indexing in NMRVIEW was helpful for identifying secondary structure.64 Peak lists for all spectra were generated either with the peak picking algorithm incorporated in NMRVIEW or with the program PIPP.65

Structure calculations
For the four-dimensional NOESY data from the 13 C/13 C HMQC-NOE66 and 15 N/13 C (HMQC/HSQC) NOE67 , some peaks were assigned manually. An in-house program listing possible assignments according to chemical shifts was used

NMR experiments and assignments
NMR experiments were performed on Bruker AMX-600, DRX-500, or DRX-500 equipped with a cryoprobe. Experiments were performed at 30 ° C, unless otherwise noted.

to generate possible assignments for each peak. Initial ° structures were generated (3­5 A rmsd) and were used to distance-filter probable assignments (possibilities were ° eliminated if they were >8 A apart in the structures). This approach led to some assignments, but the low quality of the initial structures made this process difficult; thus, distancefiltering was also done through examination of homologous structures. Using sequence alignment and comparison of regions of the secondary structure, peak filtering for MJ1529 was done using the structure from P. kodakarensis, the most homologous protein.34 As described above, initial restraints were generated from manual assignment of 3D 15 N-NOESY and partial assignment of 4D 13 C/13 C and 15 N/13 C NOESYs. These restraints were incorporated into structure calculation using the program DYANA.68 In addition, 3 JHN H coupling constants providing information on dihedral angles were used as restraints. The program TALOS was used to generate a list of likely and dihedral angles on the basis of comparison of sequence triplets to a database containing structure and sequence information from the RCSB.25 One hundred structures were generated, and the 20 with lowest energies were analyzed for consistent NOE distance violations. This yielded structures with an overall ° rmsd of ¾2.5A. To aid NOE assignment the programs ARIA and CYANA, both of which incorporate ambiguous NOEs into structure determination as part of an iterative assignment process, were used.26 ­ 28 Although in principle each program may be used de novo, i.e. without any initial structures or restraints, it was found that providing initial structures from manual assignments (including NOEs, coupling constants, and hydrogen bonds) greatly improved the success of the assignment process for both programs. After the runs, unambiguous, ambiguous, and rejected peak lists were inspected for accuracy. Although many assignments appeared to be correct, some accepted peaks were incorrectly assigned, while some ambiguous assignments that were rejected on the basis of stringent criteria were reincorporated in the structure calculation process. Results from ARIA yielded a highly converged C-terminus (for residues 70­140, the overall rmsd was ° 0.9 A). However, almost no structure was detected at all by the program in the N-terminal part of the protein, and the C-terminal helix was distorted because of improperly determined contacts with the N-terminus. The program CYANA, with similar initial inputs as ARIA, yielded a clearly discernible three-stranded -sheet in the N-terminal part of the protein and resulted in an overall rmsd for residues 3­25 ° and 48­155 of 1.5 A. Through manual and automated assignment by ARIA and CYANA, approximately 1000 NOE distance restraints (binned either automatically by the above programs or through the program NMRVIEW) were determined. Although there is some inherent `unstructuredness' to the protein, particularly in the N-terminus, residual dipolar coupling (rdc) data was acquired to provide more long-range orientational restraints.

The final residual dipolar coupling data used in structure calculations of MJ1529 were derived from a sample containing 25 mM NaPhos, 200 mM NaCl, and 5% DMPC : DHPC : CTAB (30 : 10 : 1 molar ratio,69 AVANTI Polar Lipids). After temperature-induced alignment, 2D IPAP-HSQC spectra were acquired at 312 K.70 Isotropic spectra were acquired at 303 K. This data resulted in 71 HN­N rdc's being incorporated into structure calculations. A modified HNCO experiment was used to measure C ­ C' couplings, and a SEMI-CT-HSQC was acquired to extract HN­C', and N­C' couplings simultaneously.71 Although the addition of CTAB enhanced the stability of the sample over undoped bicelles, deterioration of the sample over time was noticeable. For determining the magnitude and rhombicity of the alignment tensor, a histogram of the measured dipolar couplings was plotted, yielding an approximate Da and R by analysis of the distribution.72 This last method relies upon a uniform distribution of couplings (and hence bond vectors) and the accuracy improves as more types of rdc data are added. Histograms of the data yielded by study of MJ1529 did not resemble a powder pattern. The maximum values of Da were different in different experiments, meaning that there was either nonuniformity in the distribution of couplings, or that the alignment tensor was changing over time because of inherent instability of the sample. Thus, rough estimates of Da and R were refined according to the procedure of Clore, et al.73 Residual dipolar couplings were incorporated into the program CNS as restraints with the alignment tensor being represented as a pseudo fouratom molecule. Given the difficulty in data acquisition and analysis, only data from one type of bond vectors were used (HN­N) and the force constant was set to a relatively low value (0.3 kcal/Hz2 ). The final Da and R values used were 7.0 Hz and 0.30, respectively. For the final structures, the lowest energy structures from a total of 100 calculated without residual dipolar couplings were refined with residual dipolar couplings (50 total structures calculated), with the ten lowest energy taken as the final structures. The annealing protocol included 2000 slow cooling torsion angle dynamics steps, and 6000 additional Cartesian dynamics steps. The final structures were deposited to the PDB, accession code 2g7h.

CONCLUSIONS
Protein/DNA interfaces are proposed to be somewhat flexible.19,74,75 This would seem to be particularly important for DNA-repair proteins, such as MGMT, that have little sequence specificity, little preference for double over singlestranded DNA, and can accommodate different sizes and types of base modifications. In the case of MGMT, this flexibility is likely to come from the wing portion of the protein. The broadening of some amide residues within the wing may indicate a conformational flexibility that allows the wing to adjust or move to allow the proposed extra-helical base to be exposed to C128 and other conserved residues in the active site. This is more likely than flexibility within the hth, which is tightly coupled and constrained by secondary structure order.

One of the most intriguing questions that remain about MGMT is how it locates damaged bases among scores of unmodified bases. Studies of O6 MG-containing oligonucleotides indicate that the lesion is destabilizing (as judged by melting temperature), but otherwise causes only slight deformations in the backbone of DNA.76,77 While it is possible that these modified bases are occasionally already extra-helical when MGMT comes along, other proposed methods of action by MGMT include processive movement along DNA by cooperative interactions between proteins, and targeting of MGMT to active replication sites.20,43,77 In the cocrystal structures of hMGMT with DNA, MGMT binding introduces a slight bend in the DNA that may exploit already weak interactions of modified bases in the duplex.43,44 Further clarification of the repair mechanism will be addressed by other biophysical studies.
