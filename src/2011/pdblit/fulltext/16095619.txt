Abstract Molecular dynamics simulations and binding affinity studies have been carried out in order to probe the effect of the charge state of His110 and cofactor NADPH on the binding affinity of the potent inhibitor tolrestat to aldose reductase (ALR2) complexed with either NADPH or NADP '. Molecular dynamics simulations of ALR2 /NADP ' /tolrestat indicate that the carboxylate group of tolrestat forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr48 and His110 of ALR2 regardless of the charge state of His110. In the case of ALR2 /NADPH /tolrestat, the H-bonding pattern is significantly different from that of ALR2 /NADP' /tolrestat, in that Tyr48 does not H-bond to tolrestat. The binding affinity of tolrestat to ALR2 complexed with either NADPH or NADP ' is comparable and pH-dependent. Based on the H-bonding interactions seen in computer simulations, it is proposed that the cationic moiety at the active site of ALR2 /NADP ' and ALR2 /NADPH that interacts with the carboxylate of tolrestat is NADP ' and His110, respectively. The residue that gives rise to the pH-dependent binding of tolrestat to ALR2 /NADP' and ALR2 /NADPH has been identified as Tyr48 and His110, respectively. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction Aldose reductase (E.C. 1.1.1.21: ALR2) is an enzyme that utilizes cofactor NADPH to reduce glucose to sorbitol, and had been linked to a number of diabetic complications [1]. The possi-

bility that inhibition of ALR2 can provide a direct treatment of diabetic complications independent of controlling blood sugar levels has led to a development of a number of structurally diverse aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs), most of which contain the carboxylate or hydantoin ionizable group [2,3]. In a modeling study of pharmacophore requirements for ARIs, it was proposed that the active form of ARIs has a negative charge that interacts strongly with ALR2 under physiological

conditions [4]. Since then, a number of X-ray structures of ALR2 complexed with NADP ' and inhibitors have been solved [5 /7] and have consistently shown that the negatively charged group of ARIs H-bonds with Tyr48 and His110 at the active site of ALR2. These X-ray structures strongly suggest that the charge interaction provided by the negative charge on ARIs is the driving force for steering inhibitors to the active site of ALR2 and other members of the aldo /keto reductase family as well. While X-ray structures [5 /7] and modeling studies [8,9] have provided a structural basis for molecular recognition between inhibitors and ALR2, finer details such as which cation interacts with the negatively charged group of ARIs still remain unresolved. Based on the binding assay that inhibitor alrestatin binds preferentially with the complex of ALR2 /NADP' over ALR2 / NADPH, the positive charge on the nicotinamide ring of NADP ' was cited as the cationic source at the active site of ALR2 /NADP(H) [10]. However, this finding is not in agreement with the reported comparable binding of inhibitor zopolrestat [11] to either ALR2 /NADPH or ALR2 /NADP '. Recent binding assays have also shown no difference in the binding affinity of tight binding inhibitors, e.g. ponalstat and Al1576, toward either binary complex [12,13]. These data suggest that the charge state of the cofactor is not critical in binding inhibitors to ALR2. Moreover, it raises a question on the source of the cationic group at the active site, particularly, when negatively charged ARIs bind to the complex of ALR2 /NADPH. Thus, His110 at the active site of ALR2 /NADPH is the prime candidate for the cationic source. Nevertheless, both the hydrophobic environment at the active site of ALR2 and the loss of catalytic activity of the Y48F mutant were cited in arguments favoring a neutral His110 [14,15]. In contrast, a pH-dependence study of alcohol oxidation by ALR2 and the presence of a water channel linking the Nd1 of His110 to the bulk solvent suggest that His110 is doubly protonated [16,17]. A study of the computational catalytic mechanism of ALR2 studied by the combined potentials of quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) also favors the positively charged

His110 [18]. In addition, mutation and kinetic studies on 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a member of the aldo /keto reductase family, have suggested that His117 at the active site (His110 in ALR2) is positively charged, and then proposed that His117 H-bonding to Tyr57 (Tyr48 in ALR2) facilitates the proton transfer of the hydroxyl of Tyr57 to a substrate during catalysis [19,20]. The comparable binding of inhibitors to either ALR2 /NADPH or ALR2 /NADP', together with both experimental and theoretical evidence of a positively charged His at the active site of aldo /keto reductase, suggests that there are four different charge states in which inhibitors can bind to ALR2: a doubly charged state (NADP ', His '110) and a singly charged state (NADPH, His '110) under acidic condition as well as a singly charged state (NADP ', His0110) and a neutral state (NADPH, His0110) under basic condition. One way to investigate the H-bonding interaction of inhibitors with ALR2 in various charge states is by X-ray diffraction. However, even if the X-ray structures were available, it would be still difficult to determine the charge states of His110 and NADPH since protein X-ray structure, generally, does not resolve hydrogen positions. In this regard, computer simulations are valuable in studies of the H-bonding interactions between inhibitors and ALR2 in different charge states. In the present study, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the Hbonding interactions between ALR2 /NADP(H) and a potent inhibitor tolrestat (1) in four

charge states. The simulated H-bonding interactions provide a structural basis for the observed binding affinity of tolrestat to ALR2 /NADP(H) at pH 6.5 and 9.5.

2.2. Materials MicorconTM 10 was obtained from Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA 01915), and human muscle ALR2 was purchased from Wako BioProducts (Richmond, VA 23237). A cofactor in human muscle ALR2 was removed by chromatofocusing using a Mono P anion exchange column as previously described [12]. ARI, Tolrestat, was a gift from Wyeth-Ayerst Research (Princeton, NJ). NADP(H) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were of reagent grade, and HPLC solvents were of HPLC grade. Preparation of buffer: 6.3 mM K/Na2 phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 contained 6.3% glycerol, 0.63 mM dithiothreitol and 0.03 mM NADP(H). 2.2.1. Isolation of enzyme /NADP(H) /tolrestat and determination of reductase activity Tolrestat (250 pmol) was added to 146 pmol of enzyme dissolved in 200 ml of 6.3 mM Na, Kphosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 6.3% glycerol, 0.63 mM dithiothreitol and 0.03 mM of either NADPH or NADP'. The inhibitor-enzyme mixture was centrifuged in a Microcon 10 unit at 16 000 )/g for 15 min. Samples were further washed 3 times with 200 ml of the above phosphate buffer. The ALR2 /NADP(H) /tolrestat complex was recovered by placing the sample reservoir upside down in a new vial, adding 40 ml of buffer without a cofactor and centrifuging the sample for 3 min at 16 000)/g . Binding as indicated by inhibition of reductase activity was determined by comparing the relative reductase activity in the tolrestat treated samples to reductase activities in similar control samples of enzyme not incubated with tolrestat. This % inhibition was calculated using an equation: ALR2 inhibition (%) 0100)(Control Activity(ARI Activity)= (Control Activity) ALR2 activity was spectrophotometrically determined as previously described [12]. Briefly, a 1 ml assay contained 3 mM of NADPH, 1 mM DLglyceraldehyde and 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.2 at 25 8C. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme. The initial rate of reactions was

2. Method and materials 2.1. Molecular dynamics simulations The coordinates of human ALR2 complexed with NADP(H) (1ADS) [21] were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Hydrogens were added to the amino acid residues of human ALR2 using the HBUILD routine of CHARMM [22]. Tolrestat was manually docked into the active site of ALR2 complexed with either NADP' or NADPH so that the carboxylate group of tolrestat could form hydrogen bonding interactions with Tyr48 and His110 while the aromatic portion of tolrestat was positioned between Leu300 and Phe122 as reported in a crystal structure [7]. All Asp and Glu residues were assumed to be negatively charged while Arg and Lys were positively charged. His110 was treated as both positively charged and neutral with the hydrogen on the No2 atom. Charge assignment on NADPH, NADP' and tolrestat, the hydration of the complex of ALR2 /NADP' / tolrestat, and the subsequent energy minimization by CHARMM with an all-atom parameter set [23] were carried out according to the procedures published elsewhere [8,18]. Energy minimizations were performed with a constant dielectric constant (o 0/1). Electrostatic force was treated with the force switch method [24] and a switching range of  8 /12 A for MM interactions. van der Waals interactions were calculated with the shift method  with a cutoff of 12 A. Using the energy minimized structure as the starting geometry, each of the four complexes was heated to 300 K, equilibrated for 20 ps, and another 180 ps MD trajectory was collected for analysis. Dynamics were run using Verlet integration with a time step of 1 fs. During 20 ps equilibration, the velocities were scaled every 1 ps to maintain a temperature near 300 K. The initial velocities were assigned from a MaxwellBoltzmann distribution at a temperature of 300 K.

monitored by following the decrease of the reduced pyridine nucleotide at 340 nm; o 0/6270 M(1 cm (1 in a 1.0 cm light path in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). 2.2.2. Effect of pH and cofactor NADP(H) on the formation of ALR2 /NADP(H) complex The effect of cofactor, NADP(H), on the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex was investigated at pH 6.5 and 9.5 with buffer composed of 2-(N morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES, 0.05 M), tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (Tris, 0.1 M) and acetic acid (0.05 M) by adjusting the pH by addition of either 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH. The ALR2 /NADP(H) complexes formed with tolrestat (250 pmol) and enzyme (137 pmol) were recovered and the reductase activity was determined as described above.

3. Results and discussion The average root mean square deviation (RMSD) of both ALR2 backbone and heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms of ALR2 /NADP(H) /tolrestat from the X-ray structure at four different charge states are listed in Table 1. These values were calculated from the last 180 ps of the simulations. Considering the two protonation states of His110 in the NADP(H) complex, the ALR2 backbone RMSD ranges from 1.17 to 1.34  A. These comparable RMSD values indicate that the backbone of ALR2 is well maintained during 200 ps simulations. When all of the heavy atoms of ALR2 were included, the RMSD values increased  by 0.32 /0.42 A, reflecting side chain flexibility.

Active-site H-bonding patterns were also analyzed and compared with the X-ray structure to determine whether a change in the charge state disrupts H-bonding interactions at the active site. Hydrogen bonds between the amide group of NADP(H) and residues Ser159, Asn160 and Gln183 (Fig. 1) as well as the H-bonding network among Asp43, Tyr48 and Lys77 were analyzed. Ser159, Asn160 and Gln183 orient the nicotinamide ring of NADPH in order to direct the 4-pro R hydrogen toward the opening [21] while the hydrogen-bonding network among Asp43, Tyr48 and Lys77 plays a critical role during catalysis [24]. As shown in Table 2, calculated H-bonding distances differ from the crystal structure no  more than 0.6 A, suggesting that the conformation at the active site is also well maintained regardless of the charge state of His110 and NADPH. The structure of tolrestat complexed with ALR2 /NADP(H), averaged over 180 ps of dynamics, is depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Both Fig. 2a (His '110, NADP') and b (His0110, NADP ') illustrate that the carboxylate group of tolrestat H-bonds with Tyr48 and His110 while the aromatic portion of tolrestat is positioned to form aromatic /aromatic interactions with Trp20, Trp111 and Phe122. These interactions are in good agreement with those reported in the X-ray structure of porcine ALR2 /NADP ' /tolrestat [7]. The fact that the H-bonding interactions seen in Fig. 2a and b are essentially identical suggests that the H-bonding pattern itself is not sufficient to determine the charge state of His110 of ALR2 / NADP ' /tolrestat. When tolrestat binds to ALR2 /NADPH as depicted in Fig. 3a (His '110, NADPH) and b (His0110, NADPH), the H-bonding interactions, however, are signifi-

cantly different from those seen in the X-ray structure: tolrestat H-bonds with the positively charged His110 but not with Tyr48, whereas it does not H-bond with both neutral His110 and Tyr48. The time dependence of the distance between Tyr48 and the carboxylate oxygen of tolrestat (Fig. 4) provides insights about the motions of tolrestat at the active site. With NADP', Tyr48 maintains a strong and stable H-bond with tolrestat (2.09/0.2  A) whether His110 is neutral or positively charged. This H-bond was weakened/broken in the ALR2 / NADPH simulations as indicated by the increased separation and fluctuations.

The comparable H-bonding pattern between the X-ray structure and the computer simulations validates the use of MM in simulating the H-bonding interaction between tolrestat and ALR2 /NADP '. However, in the absence of any reported X-ray structure of an inhibitor bound to ALR2 / NADPH, it is difficult to assess the validity of the H-bonding patterns observed in ALR2 / NADPH /tolrestat. Ongoing studies, including QM/MM dynamics simulations of ALR2 / NADPH /tolrestat, will help assess the importance of charge polarization in simulating H-bonding interactions. The inhibition of reductase activity of ALR2 / NADP(H) /tolrestat at both pH 6.5 and 9.5 is summarized in Table 3. The inhibition of ALR2 activity vs. pH illustrates that the binding of tolrestat to ALR2 is independent of the charge state of NADPH while it is pH dependent. At pH 9.5, inhibition of reductase activity of ALR2 / NADP(H) /tolrestat decreases by about 50% relative to that at pH 6.5 amounting to an approximately 100-fold decrease in binding affinity. The Hbonding pattern seen in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 could provide a rationale for this observed pH-dependent inhibition. The neutral His110 at 9.5 provides a much weaker charge interaction to tolrestat than

the positive His110 at pH 6.5. This loss of charge interaction is likely responsible for the approximately 100-fold decrease in tolrestat binding to either ALR2 /NADP' or ALR2 /NADPH at pH 9.5. H-bonding interactions, however, do not fully account for the observed binding of tolrestat to both ALR2 /NADP and ALR2 /NADPH at a given pH. For example, the comparison of Fig. 2a and Fig. 3a suggests that tolrestat would preferentially bind to ALR2 /NADP ' over ALR2 / NADPH because of an extra positive charge on NADP'. This inconsistency between the H-bonding interactions and the experimental finding naturally leads to the proposal as shown in Fig. 5. At pH 6.5, the positive charge on NADP ' is likely to prevent

His110 from becoming doubly protonated to avoid unfavorable positive /positive charge repulsion. As a result, at pH 6.5, the charge interaction provided by either NADP' or positively charged His110 to tolrestat becomes comparable, and this qualitatively explains the fact ALR2 /NADPH and ALR2 /NADP' have the same binding affinity for tolrestat. At pH 9.5, Tyr48 in ALR2 /NADP ' / tolrestat and His110 in ALR2 /NADPH/tolrestat are likely to be deprotonated, resulting in a decrease of tolrestat binding as compared to the situation at pH 6.5. It is expected that Tyr48 in ALR2 / NADPH at pH 9.5 remains neutral to avoid a charge repulsion with the carboxylate of tolrestat. It would require free-energy perturbation simulations to quantify the charge interaction provided by His110 and NADP'. Nevertheless, this proposed cationic source at pH 6.5 and the respective charge interactions shown in Fig. 5 not only provide a rationale for the observed binding of tolrestat to ALR2 /NADP(H), but are also in full agreement with the previous finding that His at the active site of aldo /keto reductase is positively charged [18,19]. The existence of positively charged His at the active site of aldo /keto reductase poses an interesting question as to the identity of the proton donor, which has been debated considerably [14 / 20,25 /27]. It can be argued that His110, while remaining neutral during catalysis, becomes posi-

tively charged in the presence of negatively charged inhibitors. Similarly, the hydride transfer to an aldehyde substrate during catalysis creates an alkoxide-like anion intermediate, which will then raise the pKa of His110 to favor its being positively charged. In the catalytic mechanism of ALR2 and other members of aldo /keto reductase, it was demonstrated that the hydride transfer, not the proton transfer, is the rate-determining step [18,27]. Either Tyr48 or His110 could be the proton donor as pointed out in a previous QM/MM study [18]. Of the two residues, however, His110 is most likely to be the proton donor since the reduction process catalyzed by the positively charged His110 is both thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable than that catalyzed by Tyr48 [18]. Moreover, a number of X-ray structures have consistently shown a water channel connecting the Nd1 of

His110 to bulk solvent. This water channel is likely to be a conduit of protons to His110 before or during catalysis. Tyr48 appears to be a structurally critical residue because of abolished reductase activity of the Tyr48 mutant. Nonetheless, it is quite plausible that various members of the aldo / keto reductase family containing the Tyr mutant maintain robust activity as seen in the case of 3ahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [20]. This will demonstrate that mutation studies alone cannot determine the proton source since the loss of catalytic activity of the Tyr mutant may well arise from subtle structural differences.
