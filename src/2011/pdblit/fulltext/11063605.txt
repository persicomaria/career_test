The nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) facilitates the repair of DNA strand breaks and is implicated in the resistance of cancer cells to certain DNA-damaging agents. Inhibitors of PARP have clinical potential as resistance-modifying agents capable of potentiating radiotherapy and the cytotoxicity of some forms of cancer chemotherapy. The preclinical development of 2-aryl-1H-benzimidazole-4-carboxamides as resistance-modifying agents in cancer chemotherapy is described. 1H-Benzimidazole-4-carboxamides, particularly 2-aryl derivatives, are identified as a class of potent PARP inhibitors. Derivatives of 2-phenyl-1Hbenzimidazole-4-carboxamide (23, Ki ) 15 nM), in which the phenyl ring contains substituents, have been synthesized. Many of these derivatives exhibit Ki values for PARP inhibition < 10 nM, with 2-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (78, Ki ) 1.6 nM) being one of the most potent. Insight into structure-activity relationships (SAR) for 2-aryl-1Hbenzimidazole-4-carboxamides has been enhanced by studying the complex formed between 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (44, Ki ) 6 nM) and the catalytic domain of chicken PARP. Important hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the protein have been identified for this inhibitor. 2-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (45, Ki ) 6 nM) potentiates the cytotoxicity of both temozolomide and topotecan against A2780 cells in vitro (by 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively).
Introduction Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, EC 2.4.2.30) is a nuclear enzyme with an important role in the process of genomic repair.2,3 Inhibition of PARP in tumor cells may potentiate radiotherapy and certain kinds of cancer chemotherapy targeted to DNA.4 Three structural domains control the activity of PARP: the N-terminal DNA binding domain (containing two zinc fingers), a central automodification domain, and the highly conserved C-terminal catalytic region.5 The enzyme initially recognizes and binds to a site of DNA damage. Binding to DNA stimulates PARP to catalyze the synthesis of linear and branched ADP-ribose polymers from substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), with concomitant release of nicotinamide.6 The mechanism of polymer formation has recently been probed using the techniques of X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis, which have shown the significance of the strictly conserved active site residue Glu 988.7 The polymer can be anchored either to the automodification domain of PARP or to an adjacent histone. Poly(ADPribose) is in a dynamic state, its rapid synthesis being followed by a degradation catalyzed by the enzyme poly(ADP) glycohydrolase, before resynthesis occurs.8,9 The

binding of PARP to a DNA nick may cause a transient halt to cellular activity, allowing access of DNA repair enzymes to the damage.10 Alternatively, formation of poly(ADP-ribose) or the fragments from metabolism of this polymer may signal to a cell that its DNA is damaged.8 The ability of tumor cells to recognize and repair damage to DNA inflicted by cancer therapy is an important mechanism of resistance to treatment. However, in the absence of DNA damage, PARP does not appear to be necessary for cell survival. PARP `knockout' mice are viable and appear to be largely unaffected by the lack of the enzyme.11 If PARP has no involvement in critical physiological processes, then inhibiting the enzyme is unlikely to induce major toxicity. PARP is therefore an attractive target for drug design in the context of cancer treatment. Early studies identified nicotinamide (1) and various 3-substituted benzamides [e.g. 2, R ) NH2 (3AB)] as inhibitors of PARP.12-14 However, these compounds lack potency and specificity, and some are poorly soluble in water. A significant advance was the synthesis of the dihydroisoquinolines 3 and 4 in which the carboxamide is constrained within a ring. Compound 3 is much more active than 4 as an inhibitor of PARP (IC50 values of 0.41 and 8 µM, respectively).15 These results suggest that the conformation of NAD+ that binds to PARP has the carboxamide carbonyl anti to the C2-C3 bond. This supposition was confirmed by ab initio molecular orbital

calculations on the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+, which revealed that the conformation with the carbonyl positioned anti to the 2,3-bond (5) is preferred over that in 6.16 The carboxamide group can also be restricted via an intramolecular hydrogen bond, as demonstrated for benzoxazole-4-carboxamides 7 (X ) O, R ) Me)17a and for benzimidazole-4-carboxamides17b (see also below).

Scheme 1a

In this paper, we report the synthesis of a series of 2-arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamides 7 (X ) NH), which are potent inhibitors of PARP and are able to act as resistance-modifying agents18 for radiotherapy and certain types of chemotherapy.19 These compounds contain an intramolecular hydrogen bond, which helps to impose the conformation of the molecule necessary for inhibitory activity against PARP. We have previously reported on the ability of quinazolinone inhibitors of PARP to augment DNA-damaging drugs.18-20 Results and Discussion Chemistry. A variety of methods have been employed to synthesize the benzimidazole-4-carboxamides described herein. The 2-substituted benzimidazole-4-carboxylic acids 18, 20, and 22 were obtained by heating 2,3-diaminobenzoic acid (11) with a carboxylic acid in the presence of hydrochloric or polyphosphoric acid (Phillips synthesis; cf. Scheme 2).21,22 The required 2,3-diaminobenzoic acid (11) was readily obtained in multigram quantities from 3-nitrophthalic anhydride (8) by a literature procedure (Scheme 1).23 Thus, regioselective ring opening of 8 with ammonia yielded amide 9, a substrate for a Hofmann rearrangement that afforded 2-amino-3-nitrobenzoic acid (10). Reduction of 10 gave 2,3-diaminobenzoic acid (11), while other standard reactions gave the useful intermediates 12-14 and 68 (Scheme 1). The benzimidazole-4-carboxylic acids 18, 20, and 22 were each converted into the corresponding amides 19, 21, and 23, respectively, via the acid chloride (Scheme 2). Methyl 2,3-diaminobenzoate (12) was used to prepare 2-arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamides 24-30. The more nucleophilic 3-amino group of 12 was selectively acylated with an aryl acid chloride. The resulting intermediate amide was cyclized under acidic conditions to give the methyl ester of a 2-arylbenzimidazole-4carboxylic acid, which was converted to the required amide by treatment with ammonia under pressure. Both of the methods described above were inefficient and not generally applicable. A modified version of a procedure first reported by Weidenhagen24 was devel-

oped for the direct preparation of numerous 2-arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxylic acids and amides. In this method either 2,3-diaminobenzoic acid (11) or its amide (13) was treated with an aryl aldehyde and copper(II) acetate25 to give the desired 2-arylbenzimidazole-4carboxylic acid or amide (Tables 2 and 3). Of all the methods utilized to synthesize the benzimidazole inhibitors described herein, the route starting with amide 13 (Scheme 2) was the most efficient. For the preparation of 2-trifluoromethylbenzimidazole (17; Scheme 3), methyl 2-amino-3-nitrobenzoate (14) was acylated with trifluoroacetic anhydride to yield 15. Hydrogenation (see introduction to the Experimental Section) of 15 yielded methyl 2-trifluoromethylbenzimidazole-4-carboxylate (16) directly, the cyclization step occurring in situ. The activating effect of the trifluoromethyl group enabled the conversion of 16 into amide

17 by treatment with aqueous ammonia. 2-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (45) was prepared from the corresponding 4-methoxy compound 38 by treatment with BBr3 in DCM. 4-Carboxyphenylbenzimidazole (46) was obtained by basic hydrolysis of 2-(4cyanophenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (41). Benzimidazole N-alkylation and N-acylation (47-49) was achieved by treatment of the appropriate benzimidazole with an equivalent of potassium hydroxide in acetone before addition of the alkylating (MeI) or acylating agent (BzCl and CbzCl).26 2-Arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamides containing a hydroxymethyl group at the 2-, 3-, and 4-positions (7880) were prepared by the Weidenhagen method from the corresponding aldehyde precursors (70, 72, 74). These were prepared by monosilylation of the appropriate benzene-dimethanol with triisopropylsilyl chloride (Scheme 4), with benzene-1,2-dimethanol giving the highest yield (85%) because further silylation is inhibited by the adjacent bulky ortho-silyl group. Oxidation of each monosilylated benzene-dimethanol with manganese dioxide afforded the required aldehyde. Compounds expected to exhibit low activity against PARP were synthesized for comparative biological studies. The N-methylamides 88 and 90 were obtained by reaction of the corresponding methyl ester with methylamine. In these amides a critical hydrogen-bonding site is blocked by N-methylation. Likewise, 2-arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxylic acids (e.g. 91 synthesized from 2,3diaminobenzoic acid (11) and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde via the Weidenhagen method) lack the amide functionally required for binding to PARP. Inhibitory Activities of 2-Substituted Benzimidazole-4-carboxamides Against PARP. In this study, structure-activity relationships (SAR) for a series of 2-substituted benzimidazole-4-carboxamides have been probed by assaying for in vitro activity against recombinant human PARP. The simple benzimidazole-4carboxamides (17, 19, 21) showed sub-micromolar activity against PARP and are considerably more active than the classical PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide

(2, R ) NH2, Ki ) 3100 nM). However, placing a phenyl group at the 2-position gave a significant increase in activity (23, Ki ) 15 nM). A series of 2-arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamides was therefore synthesized to enable the SAR for substituents on the phenyl ring to be explored. A variety of substituents, with differing electronic properties, were introduced at the 3- and 4-positions (38-46). Inhibition data showed that PARP tolerates a variety of 3- and 4-substituents on the 2-phenyl group well and does not discriminate significantly between electronically differing groups. 2-(4Cyanophenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (41, Ki ) 4 nM) was the most active compound among these inhibitors. Comparison of 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)benzimidazole4-carboxamide (44) with 2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (60) showed little difference in activity (Ki ) 6 nM for both compounds), indicating that there is no favorable hydrogen-bonding interaction with the protein for the 3-hydroxy group. Similarly, 2-(4methoxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (38) and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (45) were equipotent (Ki ) 6.8 and 6 nM, respectively). The position of the substituent (3 versus 4) is also relatively unimportant for the aforementioned examples. However, 2-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (78) was significantly more active (Ki ) 1.6 nM) than its 3-hydroxymethyl isomer 79 (6.8 nM). As expected, the precursor (75) of 78, containing a bulky trialkylsilyl group, exhibited much reduced activity (Ki ) 85 nM). Both 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (61, Ki ) 126 nM) and 2-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (81, Ki ) 190 nM) were considerably less active than their 3- and 4-substituted counterparts. However, comparison of the data for the 2-methoxy group (61) with the isosteric 2-hydroxymethyl group (80, Ki ) 10.6 nM) suggests that the hydroxymethyl group of 80 interacts with the enzyme via a hydrogen bond or solvent molecule. Furthermore, this compound is nearly as potent as its 3-isomer 79 (see above). It is important to note that 2-(2chlorophenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (82) and 2-(2fluorophenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (84) are both well-tolerated by the enzyme (Ki ) 9.4 and 9 nM, respectively) and are comparable in activity to their 3-analogues (e.g. 83). It appears that relatively small groups and substituents containing a hydroxyl group can be accommodated at the 2-position. Benzimidazole-4-carboxamides containing a disubstituted (62, 63, 67, 86, 87) and trisubstituted (64) 2-phenyl group were synthesized to explore further the SAR. These compounds showed improved aqueous solubility compared to monosubstituted analogues. The disubstituted inhibitors were generally well-accepted by the enzyme, with the benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (86) being particularly active (Ki ) 2.0 nM). The isomeric benzimidazole 62 was 6-fold less active (Ki ) 13 nM). The 2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (64) exhibited a sharp decrease in activity (Ki ) 136 nM) indicating that while one meta-substituent is well-tolerated, an additional meta-substituent is not. For compounds 47 and 49 there is a decrease in inhibitory activity as the size of the N(1) substituent increases (Ki ) 32 and 530 nM for methyl and benzyl-

As expected, replacement of the primary carboxamide of 2-arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamides with a secondary amide (88, 90) or carboxylic acid (91) removed all activity. Two amide protons are an absolute requirement for inhibitory activity: one proton being involved in the essential intramolecular hydrogen bond, while the other is required as a hydrogen-bonding donor to a backbone amide carbonyl group of the enzyme, as discussed below. The data presented in this section indicate that a variety of substituents at either the 3- or 4-position or at both positions enhance the potency of 2-phenylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamide as an inhibitor of PARP. The data can be understood with reference to the crystal structure of 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (44) (see below), which shows that the 3-methoxyphenyl ring occupies a large, well-defined pocket in the protein structure but with space around the ring edge that permits a variety of further substituents. Potentiation of Topotecan and Temozolomide by 2-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (45). The ability of PARP inhibitors, including 2-methylbenzimidazole (21) to act as radio- and chemopotentiators in vitro has been demonstrated.20,27 Good potentiation, as well as enzymatic inhibition, is vital if these compounds are to function as therapeutically useful resistance-modifying agents. Growth inhibition assays demonstrated that 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (NU1085, 45) potentiates topotecan (TP), a topoisomerase I inhibitor, and temozolomide (TM), a monofunctional alkylating agent recently approved for the treatment of glioma. A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells were grown in the presence of varying concentrations of TM with or without 10 µM NU1085 (45). Cells exposed to TM alone showed reduced cell survival compared to those treated in combination with a PARP inhibitor (see Figure 1). Likewise, cells exposed to TP and NU1085 (45) responded in a similar manner, the presence of the PARP

inhibitor leading to an increase in cell growth inhibition (see Figure 2). Pooled data from two independent experiments are given in Table 4. Calculation of the IC50 values for TM and TP with and without NU1085 allowed the determination of the potentiation factor, PF50, for NU1085 against each drug. The benzimidazole PARP inhibitor potentiated the cytotoxicity of temozolomide and topotecan by 2-3-fold.

The above conclusions from `traditional' analysis of the SAR data have been validated by an X-ray crystallographic study of a complex between a representative inhibitor, 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (44), and the catalytic domain of chicken PARP (see Figure 3).

three important hydrogen bonds, similar to the hydrogen bonding observed with other inhibitors bound to PARP.28,29 In this case the inhibitor carbonyl oxygen accepts two hydrogen bonds: one from the side chain oxygen of Ser 904 (3.3 Å) and the other from a Gly 863 polypeptide amide NH (2.9 Å). The amide NH of 44 syn to the carbonyl group is a hydrogen bond donor to the Gly 863 backbone carbonyl oxygen (3.2 Å). The conformation observed for the carboxamide group of 44 was also seen in the crystal structure (i.e. measured for the protein-free compound) of the analogous benzimidazole 38 and may be that intrinsically preferred by all of 2-arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamides described herein.17b The benzimidazole of 44 lies in a deep pocket formed by residues Phe 897, Ala 898, Lys 903, and Glu 988 and is buried between two tyrosine residues (Tyr 896 and 907). The residue Tyr 907 is approximately coplanar with the benzimidazole, while Tyr 896 is rotated approximately 37° from coplanarity. The 2-(3-methoxyphenyl) group is located above a large, solvent-containing cavity of the enzyme. The 2-phenyl ring is rotated approximately 23° relative to the benzimidazole plane. Both faces of the 2-phenyl group are exposed to solvent, as is the 3-methoxy group, although it is partially shielded from solvent by a mobile Gln 763 side chain. The 3-methoxy group is on the same side of the inhibitor as the 4-carboxamide and is centered over the large enzyme cavity. The unsubstituted 4- and 5-edge, on the other side of the inhibitor, is oriented toward the surface of the enzyme cavity, which is composed of the Gln 763 side chain (near 4) and main chain atoms from the carbonyl of 888 through the amide of 890 (near 5). This edge of the 2-phenyl ring is shielded from solvent, being from 3.7 to 4.9 Å away from the protein. Comparing the

3-, 4-, and 5-positions, the most available space is at the exposed position where the 3-methoxy is found. Taking into consideration the mobility of the Gln 763 side chain, significant space is also available at the 4-position, whereas less space for substituents is found extending from the 5-position. The information from the crystal structure is in accord with the findings regarding inhibitory potencies of inhibitors (see above), in particular for 2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (64, Ki ) 136 nM). An ordered water molecule is located 3.0 Å from the benzimidazole N(1) nitrogen and is a hydrogen bond acceptor. This water molecule is also 2.8 Å from the catalytically important carboxylate of Glu 988. Another water is found 3.5 Å from the 4-carboxamide nitrogen, which is also 3.1 Å from the Gly 863 carbonyl oxygen, 3.6 Å from the side chain oxygen of Ser 864, and 3.5 Å from a third water molecule. Conclusions Structural modifications around a benzimidazole-4carboxamide core have identified 2-phenyl-1H-benzimidazoles as potent PARP inhibitors with clearly defined structure-activity requirements.30 2-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole-4-carboxamide (NU1085, 45) has been adopted as a benchmark inhibitor of PARP due to its potency, ease of synthesis, and relatively good solubility in water. Potentiation experiments have shown that NU1085 (45) can increase the potency of the cytotoxic agents topotecan and temozolomide by up to 3-fold. Clinically, a drug combination that could result in reduced dosage levels and a decreased possibility of drug resistance is extremely attractive. Consideration of Ki, PF50, and crystallographic data is guiding the

Melting points were obtained on a Kofler hot stage apparatus and are uncorrected. Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded as KBr disks on a Nicolet 20 PC Fourier transform spectrometer. Proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, on a Bruker WP 200 spectrometer employing the deuterated solvent as internal standard. Unless indicated otherwise, spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 as solvent. NH and OH signals appeared as broad singlets (br s) exchangeable with D2O. Chemical shift values are quoted in parts per million (ppm) and coupling constants (J) in hertz (Hz). 1H NMR spectra of para-disubstituted aromatic rings were observed as an AABB pattern but for simplicity are quoted as doublets; key: s ) singlet, d ) doublet, t ) triplet, q ) quartet, m ) multiplet. Mass spectra were determined on a Kratos MS80 spectrometer in electron impact (EI) mode or fast atom bombardment (FAB mode using a m-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix). The TLC systems employed Merck 1.05554 aluminum sheets precoated with Kieselgel 60F254 (0.2 mm) and were visualized with UV light at 254 or 365 nm. Column chromatography was conducted under medium pressure on silica (Kieselgel 60, 240-400 mesh). Elemental analyses were performed either in-house on a Carlo-Erba Instrumentazione 1106 analyzer or by Butterworth Laboratories, Middlesex, U.K., and are within (0.4% of theoretical value unless otherwise specified. Reagents for organic synthesis were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Gillingham, U.K.) and Lancaster Synthesis (Morecambe, U.K.) and were used as received unless otherwise stated. Routine and tissue culture chemicals for growth inhibition assays were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, U.K.) unless stated otherwise. Ethanol and methanol were dried using Mg/I2 and stored over molecular sieves. Diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran were predried over CaCl2 and distilled from sodium/benzophenone. Petroleum ether refers to that fraction in the boiling range 40-60 °C. Solvents were removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Concentrated `880' ammonia (aqueous ammonia solution) was used for amide formation from acid chlorides. Unless otherwise stated, catalytic hydrogenations were performed for solutions in methanol using 10% Pd/C catalyst (10 mol % w/w) stirred under hydrogen at atmospheric pressure until gas absorption ceased. After filtration through Celite and removal of the solvent, the resulting material was used directly or purification was performed as described below. 2-Amino-3-Nitrobenzoic Acid (10).22 Potassium hydroxide pellets (22.6 g, 0.40 mol) in water (110 mL) were cooled to 0 °C.

Crystallography. Purified protein and cocrystals of the C-terminal catalytic domain of chicken PARP were obtained using procedures similar to those previously described.31 In this study, 70 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 19% PEG-3400, and 8% isopropyl alcohol were used as precipitant. X-ray diffraction data were collected from this P212121 crystal form: a ) 59.4 Å, b ) 64.3 Å, c ) 97.0 Å, at SSRL beamline 7-1.32 Data resolution is from 20.0-2.2 Å; 95006 observations were scaled and merged into 19029 unique reflections using DENZO and SCALEPACK.33 The overall R-merge is 6.1%, the ratio I/(I) is 28.3, and the data is 97.9% complete. Corresponding values for the high-resolution data shell (2.28-2.20 Å) are 22.2%, 9.8, and 95.5%, respectively. The structure of 44 complexed to PARP was solved and refined using this data, the program X-PLOR,34 and the protein and solvent starting model 1PAX from the Protein Data Bank.28 The conventional and free R-factors after refinement are 19.4% and 27.4%. The rms deviations between model and ideal bond distances, bond angles, dihedral angles, and improper angles are 0.007 Å, 1.3°, 23.6°, and 1.1°. The model coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the code 1EFY. PARP Expression and Purification. Human full length PARP protein was expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified to homogeneity as described by Giner and co-workers.35 Assay of Inhibitors with PARP. The enzymatic assay was performed as previously described36,37 with minor modifications. Samples (50 µL) containing 20 nM purified PARP protein, varying concentrations of inhibitor, 2% (v/v) DMSO, saturating amounts of DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA (10 µg/mL), and NAD+ (500 µM containing 0.5 µCi [32P]NAD+) were incubated in sample buffer [50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine,hydrochloride] at 25 °C for 5 min in 96-well plates. Under these conditions, the reaction rate was linear with time up to 8 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 40% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid and incubation at 0 °C for 30 min. The samples were transferred to a Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (BioRad), filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filter paper and washed 3× with 150 µL of wash buffer [5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, 1% (v/v) inorganic pyrophosphate]. The filter was removed from the filtration apparatus, washed once with 50 mL of wash buffer and twice with 50 mL ethanol, and dried. Incorporation of [32P]ADP-ribose into the acid insoluble material was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software. Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software) using the velocity equation for competitive inhibition.38 For tight-binding inhibitors, Ki values were calculated using the equation described.39 Growth Inhibition Assays. Solutions of temozolomide (temodal; a gift from the Cancer Research Campaign, London, U.K.), topotecan (hycamptin; Smith Kline Beecham) and NU1085 (45) in DMSO at 150, 2 and 100 mM, respectively, were stored at -20 °C. A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells were grown in HEPES-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium + 10% foetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were verified as being free of mycoplasma by fluorescence microscopy, following fixation and staining with Hoechst 33258 at monthly intervals. Cells were seeded at 2.0-2.5 × 103 cells/well in 100 µL of medium in replicate 96-well plates (leaving the outer wells with 100 µL of medium alone to minimize `edge effect') and allowed to attach overnight. After 16-24 h the medium was replaced with that containing varying concentrations of temozolomide or topotecan with or without 10 µM NU1085 (45) in a final DMSO concentration of 1%. For each drug concentration

White et al. 5 replicate wells were used. A replicate plate was fixed as described below to obtain an estimate of the cell density at the start of the drug incubation. The plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C before assaying (together with the preincubation plate) for cell growth as previously described.40 The optical density of the wells was read on a computer-interfaced MR700 microtiter-plate reader (Dynex, Billingshurst, U.K.) relative to an air blank using a 570-nm filter. Cell growth was expressed as percent (%) of an appropriate control, i.e. 1% DMSO or 10 µM NU1085 (45). The IC50 values (concentration of drug required to reduce growth by 50%) were determined by nonlinear regression curve-fitting using GraphPad PRISM (San Diego, CA) software. The potentiation factor, PF50, was calculated from IC50 of topotecan or temozolomide alone ÷ IC50 of topotecan or temozolomide + NU1085.
