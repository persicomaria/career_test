The presenceof reaginic antibodiesin the serumof allergic patients was first demonstratedby F'rausnitz and Kiistner in 1921. The nature of the antibodies remained unknown for 40 yr until IgE was found in the serum of hay fever patients and identified as a carrier of reaginic antibody activity by Ishizaka and Ishizaka. 1 Antigenic analysis of the immunoglobulin and identification of a unique myeloma protein, ND, as an IgE myeloma protein2 establishedthat IgE represents a unique immunoglobulin class. IgE has the unique property to bind reversibly with high affinity to specific membranereceptors on basophilsand mast cells. Combination of specific cell-bound IgE antibodies with antigen triggers a seriesof events that ultimately lead to the releaseof vasoactive aminesand other pharmacologically active substances responsible for the clinical manifestationsof hypersensitivity.

IgE has a molecular weight of nearly 190,000 of which approximately 12% is accounted for by carbohydrate. The molecule has the samebasic four-chain structure found in other immunoglobulins, i.e., two light, L, chains and two heavy, H, (epsilon) chains that carry the isotypic determinants (Fig. 1). A comparison of the molecular size of the epsilon polypeptide chain with those of the H chain of the other classesreveal it to be about the same as mu but 11,000 daltons more than gamma, delta, or alpha. This is because and Al, E chainshave five domains(one variable and four constants), whereasthe rest of the heavy chains have only four domains (one variable and three constants).

FIG. 1. Schematic model of IgE. One of the two class-specific antigenic determinants (El) is present on the Fc and F(ab'), fragments, is heat resistant, and is not important for binding to mast cells and basophils. The other determinant (E2) is present in the carboxyl terminal portion of the E chains, is heat labile, and is important for binding to target cells. mast cells and basophils are localized in the carboxyl terminal half (Fc portion) of the epsilon heavy chains." Partial hydrolysis of IgE molecules with papain splits the molecule into three portions, one Fc and two Fab fragments. Only the Fc fragment can bind to target cells. If IgE is digested with pepsin, then F(ab'), fragments are obtained. They are composed of two Fab and the amino terminal half of Fc and do not sensitize tissues. Thus the carboxyl terminal half of the Fc portion of IgE is essential for sensitization, and IgE molecules, combine with target cells through the Fc portion of the molecules. It is well established that reaginic antibody is heat labile. IgE looses the ability to induce a P-K reaction after heating at 56" C for 2 to 4 hr but retains its capacity to combine with allergen. Thus the Fab portion of the molecules that is involved in antigen binding is heat stable. The antigenic determinants specific for the IgE class of immunoglobulin are present in the carboxyl terminal half (Fc portion) of the heavy chain. The Fc portion has at least two antigenic determinants, Dl and D2, one of which (Dl) is shared by the F(ab'), fragments. It is interesting that this Dl determinant is heat stable, whereas the D2 determinant that is located closer to the carboxyl terminal is degraded by heating at 56" C for 2 hr.

Mechanisms of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity The most important biologic property of IgE antibody is the ability to sensitize homologous tissues for allergic reactions. The minimum concentrations of IgE antibody required for sensitizing normal human

skin for a positive P-K reaction is on the order of 0.2 to 0.3 ng,`ml. Sensitization of human skin by IgE but not by the other immunoglobulins is supported by reversed-type P-K reactions.4 Intracutaneous injection of a minute dose ( 10V4 pg) of the antibody specific for IgE into normal individuals results in induction of an erythema-wheal reaction, whereas even a thousandfold more of the antibodies specific for the other immunoglobulin classes, i.e., IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgD fail to do so. Since normal individuals have IgE that has affinity for target cells involved in P-K reactions, the skin reaction by anti-IgE results from combination of antibody with cell-bound normal IgE. IgE antibodies are responsible for PCA reactions in the monkey with sera from atopic patients.5 About 30 times as much IgE antibody is required to sensitize monkey skin as required for P-K reactions in humans. Also injection of anti-human IgE into monkey skin induces reversed-type PCA reactions.6 The reaction is due to cross-reactivity of monkey IgE with antibodies against human IgE. On the other hand, human IgE antibody does not give PCA reaction in the guinea pig. Even after intracutaneous injection of 600 pg/ml of IgE myeloma protein followed by challenge with anti-human IgE, guinea pig skin failed to exhibit reversed FCA reactions .' IgE antibodies can sensitize not only skin but also other tissues such as lung tissue. When monkey or human lung tissues are sensitized in vitro with human reaginic serum containing anti-ragweed IgE antibody and then are exposed to ragweed allergen, these tissues release histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (i.e., leukotrienes), which contract bron-

chial smooth muscle8 and eosinophil chemotactic factors. The sensitizing activity in the reaginic serum was removed by the adsorption of the serum with anti-IgE immunosorbent.6 Sensitization of homologous species with IgE antibodies can be observed at the cellular level as well. Lichtenstein and Oslefl observed histamine release from isolated leukocytes of atopic patients on exposure to allergen, and Levy and Osler'O demonstrated passive sensitization of normal human leukocytes with reaginic serum for antigen-induced histamine release. However, leukocytes from up to 60% of normal individuals cannot be passively sensitized with reaginic antibody when they are incubated with reaginic serum. Failure of passive sensitization is not due to lack of binding of IgE with basophils. These cells bind IgE on passive sensitization. The cell-bound IgE reacts with anti-IgE, but the percentage of histamine released from the cells is low. The nature of the factors that determine the ease of releasability of histamine by basophils is not known. Thus antigen-induced histamine release can be regulated by both immunologic and biochemic factors. The number and nature of cell-bound IgE antibody molecules determine the sensitivity of the cells to antigen, whereas the extent of histamine release may be regulated by enzyme systems in the cells. The discovery of IgE made it possible to demonstrate the target cells to which reaginic antibody is fixed. If one treats leukocytes with `251-labeled antiIgE, the radioactive antibody is demonstrated only on basophil granulocytes, which indicates that IgE is present on these cells but not on the other leukocytes. Furthermore, actual binding of IgE with basophil granulocytes is demonstrated by incubating leukocytes with lZ51-labeled IgE. At the tissue level, IgE is detected on mast cells but not on the other cells, and only mast cells combine with `251-labeled IgE. Thus it appears that the target cells for IgE are basophil granulocytes and mast cells. In addition to IgE, a small amount of IgG can be detected on basophil granulocytes. However, the number of cell-bound IgG molecules on basophils is about 1% of the number of cell-bound IgE molecules. Thus the relationship between IgE (or its Fc portion) and me plasma membrane of mast cells and basophils is specific, and the plasma membrane of these cells has receptors for IgE. The antigen-antibody reaction on basophils results in degranulation of cells. No leukocytes other than basophils participated in anti-IgE induced histamine release. Human basophils of normal and atopic individuals possess 10,000 to 40,000 IgE molecules per cell. After saturation of receptors for IgE with E my-

eloma protein, the number of IgE molecules per cell increases to 40,000 to 90,000, which represents the total number of receptor sites per cell, The binding of IgE with receptors is reversible. Cell-bound IgE rapidly dissociates when the cells are exposed to a pH lower than 4. `I This strongly sugg ests that covalent bonding is not involved in the binding. However, the affinity of IgE for basophils is quite high under physiologic conditions. The equilibrium constant of the binding between IgE and receptor is of the order of 10-gM.`2 The high affinity of IgE for receptors on target cells explains why a minute dose of IgE antibody can sensitize the cells and why sensitization with IgE antibody is persistent. Receptors for IgE were characterized by use of rat mast cells and RBL cells. Availability of a large number of RBL cells by in vitro culture facilitated chemical identification of the IgE receptors. The solubilized receptor molecule is monovalent with respect to binding with IgE. " Radioiodination of receptors on RBL cells by the lactoperoxidase method is prevented if the receptors are saturated with IgE. This suggests that only a small portion of a receptor molecule is exposed to the cell surface and that this area is almost completely covered by a single IgE molecule. It is well-known that monovalent hapten induce neither anaphylaxis nor reaginic hypersensitivity reactions. For example, an intracutaneous injection of monovalent hapten fails to induce erythema-wheal reactions in patients sensitive to penicillin, whereas divalent haptens do. I4 F(ab'), fragments of anti-IgE induce erythema-wheal skin reactions in both normal and atopic individuals, release histamine from human leukocytes, and release both histamine and slowreacting substance of anaphylaxis from monkey lung tissues that had been sensitized with IgE.`" Quantitatively, the ability of the F(ab'), fragments to induce the reaction is comparable to that of undigested antibody. In marked contrast, monovalent Fab monomer fragments fail to produce any of these reactions suggesting that bridging of two IgE molecules on target cells by a divalent ligand is the initial step of these reactions. Bridging of cell-bound IgE molecules by divalent antigen or anti-IgE brings two receptor molecules into close proximity. This local change or disturbance of membrane structures and/or possible interaction between adjacent receptor molecules may activate membrane-associated enzymes. Indeed direct bridging of receptor molecules induces histamine release without participation of cell-bound IgE. Thus antibodies to the IgE receptor of RBL cells (anti-RBL) were demonstrated to induce skin reactions in normal rats and noncytotoxic histamine release from normal

F(ab'), fragments of anti-RBL induce both skin reactions in normal rats and histamine release from mast cells, whereasthe Fab' monomerfragments of the antibody fail to do so. However, when the Fab' fragment of rabbit anti-RBL is injected intracutaneously into normal rats and the animals are challenged 2 hr later by antibodies againstrabbit IgG, skin sitesthat received the fragment of anti-RBL demonstratecutaneousanaphylaxis. When the results are considered collectively, the results obtained with antireceptor antibodies clearly demonstratethat bridging of receptor molecules triggers the cells for histamine release without participation of IgE. Other cells bearing receptors for IgE Recently a number of cells have beenfound to have low-affinity receptors for IgE. This is in contrast to the high-affinity receptorsof mastcells and basophils. Cells with low-affinity receptors for IgE include T cells, B cells, monocytes, and eosinophils.", l8 B cells and T cells with Fc receptors for IgE participate in the regulation of IgE-specific responsesas described below. IgE immune complexes activate monocytes to secrete mediators important in the inflammatory responseincluding prostaglandinsand leukotrienes,`s and eosinophilsarmed with IgE antibody specific to parasite antigens are able to specifically kill the parasites. It is possiblethat factors `O with affinity for IgE may bind to and regulate the growth and function not only of IgE B cells as described below but also of other cell types that have

It is firrnly established that collaboration between B cells and T cells is essentialfor the induction of antibody responses most protein antigens. This princito ple applies also to IgE-antibody formation asno IgEantibody response obtained in atbymic nude mice," is and T-independent antigens fail to raise an IgEantibody response experimental animals. Extensive in studies in experimental animals suggest that IgEantibody responsesare more susceptible than IgGantibody .responses regulatory mechanisms that to and regulatory cells involved in the IgE-antibody response are different from those involved in the IgG-antibody response. Studies on the surface immunoglobulin of B cells in the mousedemonstratethat virgin B cells bear surface IgM and that B-lymphocytes bearing other isotypes such as IgG or IgA are derived from the virgin B cells.** This principle applies to the IgE system as well. Experiments in a parasite-infected rat suggestthat a B cell factor can induce IgM-bearing virgin B cells to differentiate to IgM-IgE doublebearing cells that are the precursors of IgE-forming cells.z3Antigenic stimulation causes maturation of the these precursor cells into memory B cells that bear exclusively IgE on their surface. T cells appear to participate in the development of B memory cells from their precursors. These T cells are stimulated when antigen is injected with alum asadjuvant but not when antigen is injected without adjuvant. The differentiation of IgE-bearing memory B cells to IgE-forming plasma cells also requires T cells. Several lines of evidencesindicate that helper T cells collaborating with IgE B cells are distinct from those collaborating with IgG B cells.24 Observations by Kishimoto et al.`" suggestthat suppressor cells for T IgE are distinct from those for IgG. These investigators found that preimmunization of BALB/c mice with DNP derivatives of tubercle bacilli suppressed IgE-antibody response of the animals to DNPovalbumin but enhanced IgG-antibody responses. Furthermore, transfer of splenic T cells from immunized mice with DNP derivatives of tubercle bacilli into normal syngeneicmice-suppressed primary IgE-antibody response of the recipients to DNPovalburnin without affecting IgG-antibody response.

receptors for IgE. These receptors are shed into the medium and can be detected in the supematants as IgE binding factors because of their ability to bind IgE. These IgE binding factors home to IgE-bearing memory B cells and regulate their differentiation into plasma cells.`6 IgE-specific helper T cells are activated by two signals. The first signal causes T cells bearing receptors for Fc IgG to display a receptor for the Fc portion of IgE and to synthesize and secrete IgE binding factors. These factors, however, have no biologic activity. Their biologic activity is dependent on the presence of a second signal." This second signal is derived from another cell and is induced by the appropriate adjuvants. Adjuvants such as alum or parasitic antigens cause a discrete subset of T cells to secrete a glycosylation-enhancing factor. This factor acts on the T cell that produces the IgE binding factors to promote the glycosylation of the factors. Glycosylated-IgE binding factors possess the potentiating activity. In contrast to alum, adjuvants like complete Freund's adjuvants cause a discrete subpopulation of T cells to secrete a glycosylation-inhibition factor. This factor acts on the T cell that produces the IgE binding factors and causes the secretion of poorly glycosylated-IgE binding factors that suppress IgE synthesis. A comparison of the properties of these two factors is demonstrated in Table I. In man, association of several T cell immunodeficiencies with elevated serum-IgE levels suggested early on that T cells play an important role in the regulation of biosynthesis of IgE." The study of the regulation of human IgE synthesis in vitro has been fraught with difficulties because the amounts of IgE present in cultures is extremely small (in the picograms to few nanograms range) and is vastly exceeded by the amounts of IgG concomitantly present in the same cultures, making it extremely crucial to make use of highly specific antisera to IgE in the assays for IgE. Furthermore, preformed IgE bound to cell membranes (of basophils, monocytes, T and B cells) and present on the surface and in the cytoplasma of IgE B cells has to be accurately determined and its value subtracted from the total IgE measured in cultures, With these considerations it is clear that peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with elevated serum IgE spontaneously synthesize variable amounts of IgE in vitro ranging from 200 to 2000 pg/ml. In contrast blood lymphocytes from normal subjects do not synthesize IgE in vitro and more importantly cannot be induced to do so by conventional polyclonal activators such as pokeweed mitogen or Epstein-Barr virus. 2g, 3o This has raised some doubt about whether IgE B cells circulate at all in the peripheral blood of normal nonallergic subjects.

The little that is known about the regulation of IgE biosynthesis in man is compatible with data obtained in experimental animals. Thus T cells from patients with high serum-IgE levels release factors that enhance IgE synthesis. 2g,31When T cells from the same patients are isolated on the basis of the expression of an Fc receptor for IgE, the resultant T cell lines release an IgE binding IgE-specific enhancing factor."2 These cell lines contain predominantly T4+ cells. In this respect, Kishimoto in Mitsuya et a1.33 has reported a patient with the Sezary syndrome who had extremely elevated serum-IgE levels and whose T cells were found to help IgE synthesis in vitro. Regarding IgE-specific suppressor T cells, normal T cells of the T8+ phenotype suppress IgE production by cells of patients with high serum-IgE levels including patients with acute graft-versus-host disease that follows allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.34 In the latter situation T8+ cells of the bone marrow donors can suppress IgE production by the HLAcompatible cells of the recipient. Thus this suppression is not the result of alloreactivity. Isotype-specific regulatory factors for IgE are also found in human serum. Serum from normal nonallergic individuals contain a small molecular weight IgE binding factor that suppresses IgE production.35 In contrast, a small molecular weight IgE enhancing factor can be detected in the sera of patients with the hyper-IgE syndrome. 36 Plasmapheresis of these patients and replacement with normal serum have resulted in decreased rates of IgE synthesis by their blood lymphocytes."" Antigen-specific regulation of IgE antibodies

It is well-known that it is much more difficult to induce specific unresponsiveness in individuals who have already developed a full-fledged immune response than in virgin individuals first confronted with the antigen. In recent years, attempts to induce immunologic unresponsiveness in already sensitized individuals have rested mainly on the observation that some chemical modifications of the antigen appear able to suppress established IgE formation even in already sensitized individuals. Most of the studies on this phenomenon have been performed in mice. The list of chemical modifications that have been demonstrated to affect IgE production in mice and other species are: polymerization (e.g., glutaraldehyde); urea denaturation; binding to tolerogenic carriers (e.g., poly-D-glutamyllysine) or isologous gamma globulin; and substitution by formaldehyde, acetoacetyl groups, polyethylene glycol, monomethoxy polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, and muramyldipeptides. Frequently, the tolerogenic effect of

114

Geha

chemically modified allergens was first tested in primary sensitization of early secondary immune responses for obvious practical reasons. Although some tolerogenic carriers such as poly-D-amino acid copolymers (e .g . , o-glutamyllysine) or allergens substituted with polyethylene glycol chains37 are also suppressive for established responses, it must be acknowledged that several manipulations extremely effective in primary and secondary IgE responses may be much less effective in late, established responses. Among the factors that appear to preferentially foster IgE suppressive activity are the dose and the route of administration of antigen. Large doses of antigen appear to be IgE suppressive, and the intravenous route certainly appears to be more conducive to suppression than subcutaneous, intradermal, or intramuscular administration. Whether the immunologic tolerance frequently observed after oral administration of antigens rests on similar suppressor-T cell mechanisms remains to be demonstrated. Anti-idiotypic antibodies have been demonstrated by Blaser et al.38 to suppress IgE responses in an antigen-specific manner. In man, autoanti-idiotypic antibodies have been detected after booster immunization with antigen3" and anti-idiotypic antibodies have been demonstrated to be capable of suppressing the IgE response in vitro. 4o Prolonged administration of allergen has been demonstrated in some experimental systems to lead to the production of autoantiidiotypic antibodies. This may be the reason for the success of hyposensitization therapy in some cases and also for the progressive decline of IgE formation after such treatment. Tissue origin of human IgE

comparable to IgA. An age-dependent decline in total serum IgE occurs from the second through the eighth decades.43 Determinants of the IgE-antibody response

IgE-producing plasma cells are distributed primarily in lymphoid tissue adjacent to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. 41, 42 The highest concentration of these cells in humans is found in tonsil and adenoid tissue. IgE is apparently produced locally in lymphoid tissue and then diffuses or is transported into blood and into mucosal exocrine secretion. Otogeny of human IgE

IgE in modest amounts (0.4 to 80 IU/ml or 1 to 200 rig/ml) is detected in the sera of almost all nonallergic adults. Higher levels are frequently found in atopic patients and their families who may be genetically predisposed to increased IgE production. On the other hand, certain environmental stimuli (e.g., parasite infestation) induce pronounced increases in total serum-IgE levels in normal, nonatopic individuals. Serum-IgE levels are thus dependent on the interplay of genetic and environmental influences. Much of the data from family and twin studies are compatible with the hypothesis that elevated total IgE levels (> 100 IU/ml, >240 rig/ml) are inherited as a simple recessive trait. 44 Additionally, specific-IgE antibody responses are more frequently associated with certain HLA specificities. For example, population studies have demonstrated that persons with skin test reactivity to rye grass pollen have a threefold higher than expected frequency of HLA-B8 antigen4j IgE antibody to Ra5 is, on the other hand, associated with HLA-DW2.46 This may reflect the linkage of specific immune responses gene(s) to the HLA locus. The ability to produce IgE antibody is therefore controlled by genes that operate at multiple levels of immune regulation. A genetically predisposed individual can develop an IgE immune response only after environmental exposure to the offending antigen. In responder strains of mice, repeated exposure to low doses of an antigen favors the production of IgE over IgG. This suggests that the threshold antigen dose for IgE production is lower than for IgG. 47 In humans the IgE response to ragweed-pollen antigens is induced by chronic lowdose exposure during the pollen season. During a typical ragweed season the average patient is exposed to less than 1 vg of the predominant ragweed allergen, antigen Ei.4x Role for IgE Rare individuals with undetectable serum and cell-bound IgE are apparently healthy, which implies that IgE is not essential for the maintenance of health. Viral infections, such as bronchiolitis caused by RSV in children and infectious mononucleosis are associated with transient elevation of total serum IgE. Locally RSV-specific IgE bound to RSV-infected cells has been demonstrated.4g Since IgE immune complexes can cause macrophages to release prostaglandins and possibly leukotrienes,`s local IgE pro-

IgE-bearing B cells are detectable by the eleventh week of fetal life. However, judging from fetal serum levels, IgE production in utero is negligible. Since maternal IgE antibodies do not efficiently cross the placenta, umbilical cord-blood IgE levels are undetectable (CO.5 IU/ml) in most infants. After birth, serum-IgE levels rise, along with other immunoglobulins, with maximal values appearing in normal children between the ages of 10 and 15 yr. The rise in serum IgE toward adult levels is slower than IgG but

duction may be an important contributor to the wheezing associated with viral infections in some patients. Whether specific IgE facilitates recovery from virus infections by promoting a local inflammatory response is unknown. Several lines of evidence suggest a protective role for IgE in helminthic infections. First, the very high serum-IgE levels of patients living in areas in which these parasites are endemic suggest a priori a possible role of IgE in parasite immunity. Second, with the use of in vitro animal models, Capron and associates20, SO demonstrated IgE-dependent binding of macrophages and eosinophils to schistosomal organisms followed by killing of the organisms. IgE mechanisms cause mast cell discharge of mediators in the gastrointestinal mucosa that serve to expel helminthic parasites. Recent evidence against this possibility is that genetically mast cell-deficient mice (w-/w-) expel intestinal parasites as efficiently as mice with a normal mast cell complement.51 Last, Dessein et aL5' found that the IgE-deficient rats had two to threefold more Trichinella larvae encysted in their muscles than control litter mates. This evidence supports a direct role for IgE in parasite immunity. IgE may also play a beneficial role in the general inflammatory response by serving as a gatekeeper. IgE-dependent mast cell activation and mediator release enhance the accumulation of IgG antibodies and of mononuclear cells at the site of invading foreign antigens. In conclusion, although the evolutionary persistence of IgE suggests that it serves a protective role, the physiologic contribution of IgE to the maintenance of health remains speculative for the present. IgE immune complexes

IgE immune complexes have been detected in the circulation of patients with allergic diseases. Their levels correlate ,with total IgE. A rise in the level of IgE immune complexes has been reported after the ingestion of the allergen in patients allergic to food.s3 Complexes of IgE, and IgG and IgE have also been described."4 IgE immune complexes have been reported to cause mediator release from monocytes, to cause monocytes to increase their bone resorption capacity, and to interfere with chemotaxis.`g* s5, 56 The role of these complexes in the clinical manifestations of allergic diseases remains to be established. Measurements of serum IgE

soluble carrier and several variations of a liquid-phase competitive binding radioimmunoassay.s7, s8 Serum IgE values are generally expressed in international units per milliliter, based on a World Organization reference standard. One international unit of IgE is equivalent to approximately 2.4 ng. The variations in normal serum-IgE levels reported by independent sources are largely caused by differences in the study populations. When unselected (i.e., no effort to exclude atopic individuals) populations are sampled, total IgE levels are considerably higher than is the case when atopic individuals are systematically excluded. Since total serum-IgE levels are most frequently used in the evaluation of atopic disease, normative values for well-defined nonatopic populations are of the greatest clinical value. From several such studies the upper 95% confidence limit for serum IgE in nonallergic adults is 200 IU/ml with geometric means of 22 IUlml. In these studies significant age and sex differences among nonatopic adults were not observed. An age-related decline in serum IgE was apparent in both male and female patients. In cord serum of a newborn infant, the geometric mean for IgE is 5 rig/ml with over 50% of the newborn infants having no detectable IgE. Serum levels of IgE follow a pattern of development quite different from that observed for other serum immunoglobulins. By age 1 yr only 50% of babies have serum IgE levels higher than the neonatal range even when the infants are from highly allergic families. Median adult levels are, however, obtained at age 3 yr and rise to supraadult levels between ages 7 to 14 yr. However, at all ages normal serum-IgE levels demonstrate an extreme range. Serum-IgE levels are higher in Japanese and in races that have evolved in tropical and subtropical regions where parasitic diseases are prevalent. Most white patients of western countries with elevated serum-IgE levels have atopic disorders, including allergic rhinitis, extrinsic asthma, and atopic dermatitis. However, because of the wide range of serum-IgE levels observed in both nonatopic and atopic populations, the values obtained from subjects whose skin tests are positive and those that are negative overlap considerably. IgE in secretions The level of IgE in respiratory secretions is positively correlated with that found in serum.53 IgE detected in homogenized nasal polyps, and in most cases a higher IgE level is found in the polyp than in the serum from the same individual, suggests local synthesis. IgE is present in a variety of other tissue fluids, such as sputum, saliva, and gastrointestinal

A variety of methods are available to measure total IgE protein in sera and secretions. Currently acceptable methods include noncompetitive solid-phase immunoassays by the use of anti-IgE coupled to an in-

fluids, indicating that IgE is a widely distributed secretory antibody. Measurements antibody of antigen-specific IgE

Specific-IgE antibodies can be detected free in serum and fixed to high-affinity receptors on tissue mast cells and circulating basophils. The most commonly used test measuring IgE antibodies are (1) antibody fixed to tissue mast cells and/or basophils in vivo: skin tests and provocational challenge (nasal, conjunctival, bronchial, oral); in vitro: leukocyte histamine release, and (2) in serum in vivo: Prausnitz-Kiistner test and in vitro: radioallergosorbent test. Skin testing can be performed by scratching or pricking the skin through a drop of allergen solution or by injecting allergens intradermally. Intradermal tests are the most sensitive, but they require more time and effort and produce more patient discomfort. The advantages of skin testing include ease of performance, economy, and rapidity of results. Additionally, they assess both the presence of IgE antibodies and the ability of these antibodies to induce mediator release in a given patient. Skin testing procedures are subject to error because of variations in technique and the necessity of the use of biologically unstable and often inadequately standardized allergenic extracts. False positive skin reactions are observed at high allergen concentrations in some patients and may lead to erroneous diagnoses unless clinically normal persons are used as negative controls. Detection of serum-IgE antibody was classically accomplished by transfer of serum from an allergic subject into the skin of a normal recipient, followed by skin testing at that site 24 to 48 hr later (P-K test). Although P-K testing provides a reliable measure of IgE antibodies, it is rarely used today because of the risk of transferring hepatitis virus. RAST provides a quantitative estimate of the level of serum-IgE antibodies. The commercially available test requires 24 to 48 hr to yield results. All RAST results are reported in the form of a score (graded I to IV) based on arbitrary divisions of a birch pollen reference curve. The higher the score, the higher the level of circulating IgE antibodies, but this relationship holds only within a given allergen system; RAST scores cannot be reliably used to compare the antibody levels among different RAST specificities. RAST results correlate positively with the results of skin5g and nasal challenge testing6' as well as in vitro leukocyte or mast cell-histamine release.`jl However, when these tests are carefully performed with the use of the same allergen preparations, from 10% to 25% of

patients with positive challenge tests will have negative RAST 62This indicates that RAST is intrinsically less sensitive than the bioassays. In summary as a serologic assay, RAST is an alternative to skin testing in persons with dermographism or severe dermatitis, in small or squeamish children, or when drugs that suppress skin reactivity cannot be withdrawn. As an in vitro assay, however, RAST fails to measure the biologic function of IgE antibodies in individual patients and is also relatively expensive. IgE in atopic disease

Patients with atopic diseases, including allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and atopic dermatitis, commonly have moderately elevated IgE levels. In a few instances, most notably seasonal allergic rhinitis, it has been possible to demonstrate a significant positive correlation between the quantity of specific-IgE antibody and the intensity of patient symptoms.48 Such correlations provide indirect evidence that the IgE antibody plays a role in the pathogenesis of atopic respiratory diseases and suggest quantitation of IgE antibodies by skin testing or RAST may be useful in the assessment of IgE-mediated respiratory symptoms. One characteristic of the atopic diathesis is a propensity to `develop IgE-antibody responses to a wide spectrum of environmental allergens. This tendency may be detectable during the first year of life. OrgelP has demonstrated that serum-IgE levels taken at 1 yr of age are predictive of the subsequent development of atopic symptoms by the age of 2 yr. Serum-IgE levels are markedly elevated in approximately 90'% of patients with atopic dermatitis.64 The degree of elevation correlates roughly with severity of disease.6" The principal specificities of the IgE made by patients with atopic dermatitis are unknown. The massive elevations may result from nonspecific effects on IgE immunoregulation, since T cell dysfunction is also a feature of this disease.66 The contribution of IgE to the pathogenesis of eczema is unknown. IgE levels are higher in patients with atopic dermatitis and concomitant respiratory allergy than in those with eczema.64 In patients with symptoms of chronic rhinitis or asthma, an elevated total serum-IgE level is compatible with a:n atopic etiology. Total serum-IgE levels are positively correlated with the duration, intensity, and multiplicity of allergic sensitivities. However, a normal serum-IgE level does not rule out a limited set of IgE-dependent allergies. In patients with rhinitis or asthma who have negative skin tests, a significantly raised IgE level supports a further search for allergic sensitivities. Conversely, a normal or low serum-IgE level confirms that IgE-mediated mechanisms play

little role in the pathogenesisof the patient's symptoms. There is appreciableoverlap of serumIgE values taken from the individuals whose skin tests are positive and from thosewhose testsare negative. As a consequence,serum-IgE values lessthan 20 IU/ml or more than 250 IU/ml are the most useful in predicting the presence or absence of demonstrable IgE sensitivities to known aeroallergens. During specific immunotherapy, IgE levels initially rise. Thereafter, there is blunting of postseasonal IgE elevations and, finally, a gradual return of IgE antibody to pretreatment levels after 2 to 4 yr of therapy. 67Thus the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy is independentof significant changesin serum-IgE antibody levels. For this reason monitoring patients undergoing immunotherapy with serial RAST determinations or skin tests is unnecessary. Insect venom and penicillin-specific IgE antibodies are detectable in the sera of most but not all patients with insect and penicillin allergy, but skin testing remainsthe most sensitive and therefore presumablythe most appropriate diagnostic test for theseanaphylactic disorders. IgE immune responses food, drugs, and to stinging insects apparently do not occur more frequently among atopic patients than among the general population. IX 6gThus total serum-IgE levels are often normal in patients with these conditions. Furthermore, IgE-antibody responsesto foods, drugs, and insect venoms may be detected in individuals who are clinically tolerant when they are challenged with the allergens. This observation suggeststhat other risk factors are important in establishing the significance of IgE antibody in immunopathology and/or that protective mechanisms(IgG/blocking antibodies?) may be operative in preventing acute anaphylactic reactions in patients with antecedentIgE responses.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosisis a diseaseof atopic asthmatic individuals in which Aspergillus organisms colonizing the respiratory tract stimulate intenseIgG and IgE-antibody responses. An elevated IgE level is one of several diagnostic criteria for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis Only a .`O small fraction of the total IgE from these patients is specific forAspergillus antigens,71 suggestingthat the diseasehas a nonspecific effect on the regulation of IgE synthesis,as in the parasitic diseases.Serum IgE levels fall after successfultreatment with corticosteroids, and levels tend to rise preceding clinical exacerbations of the disease.72 IgE in nonatopic diseases BecauseT cells sensitively regulate the production of IgE antibodies, immunodeficienciesinvolving defects in cellular immunity are frequently associated with altered IgE production.73 Diseasesassociated with increasedtotal serum IgE are Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, hyper-IgE syndrome, Hodgkin's disease, acute graft-versus-host disease, and IgE myeloma. Diseases associated with normal or low serum IgE are ataxia-telangiectasia, agammaglobulinemia, hypogammaglobulinemias,chronic lymphocytic leukemia, solid tumors, and myeloma of IgG and IgA types. In the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and the hyper-IgE syndrome, levels of serum IgE often exceeding 10,000 IU/ml are found. Anergic statesaccompanying lymphoid malignancies such as Hodgkin's disease74 and immune dysfunction during acute graftare versus-host disease75 also accompanied by increases serumIgE. In Hodgkin's disease,high IgE in concentrations are reportedly associated with the histologic pattern of nodular sclerosis, and successful

treatment leads to a fall in IgE levels. Furthermore, both the depression of delayed hypersensitivity and the increase in serum-IgE levels are proportional to the extent of Hodgkin's lymphoma as determined by staging.76 The association of elevated IgE levels with certain parasitic diseases is well established (Table II). Infections with metazoan helminthic parasites are commonly associated with increased serum-IgE levels in contrast to protozoan infection in which serum-IgE levels are normal. IgG, IgM, and IgA levels are usually normal in patients with helminthic infections, which emphasizes the unique effect of these parasitic infections on the IgE isotype. In patients with helminthic infections and high IgE, only some exhibit parasitic-specific IgE. In these cases the parasitespecific IgE accounts for only small proportions of total serum IgE." Total serum-IgE levels reportedly fall after successful treatment with antihelminthics suggesting that serum-IgE levels can be used to monitor therapy. Increases in total IgE are occasionally found in patients with drug-induced interstitial nephritis's and idiopathic nephrotic syndrome7g and a variety of nonatopic skin conditions such as bullous pemphigoid, neurodermatitis, psoriasis with arthropathy, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. In patients with chronic urticaria or food intolerance, total serum-IgE levels may occasionally be helpful as an adjunctive test. Since most of these patients have non-IgE-mediated disorders, the unexpected finding of a high serum-IgE level should raise the index of suspicion for an allergic component. Finally, along with other pathologic findings, very high serum-IgE levels are a prerequisite for making the diagnosis in rare cases of IgE myeloma*' or hyper-IgE syndrome.R'
