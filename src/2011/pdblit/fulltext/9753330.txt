Synaptotagmin­Syntaxin Interaction: The C2 Domain as a Ca2 -Dependent Electrostatic Switch
Xuguang Shao,* Cai Li, Imma Fernandez,* Xiangyang Zhang, Thomas C. Sudhof, ¨ and Josep Rizo* *Departments of Biochemistry and Pharmacology  Department of Molecular Genetics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, Texas 75235 fragment containing its isolated first C 2 domain (Davletov and Sudhof, 1993) bind phospholipids in a Ca2 ¨ dependent manner. The cooperativity of this interaction and the selectivity for divalent cations are analogous to those observed in neurotransmitter release (Augustine and Charlton, 1986). Microinjection experiments in neural cells (Bommert et al., 1993; Elferink et al., 1993) and studies on strains of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans bearing mutations in the synaptotagmin gene (DiAntonio and Schwarz, 1994; Littleton et al., 1993; Nonet et al., 1993) also support a role for synaptotagmin in neurotransmitter release. Electrophysiological experiments with synaptotagmin I knockout mice have shown that this protein is essential for the fast component of Ca2 -evoked exocytosis (Geppert et al., 1994). Synaptotagmin I interacts with the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin (Yoshida et al., 1992; Bennett et al., 1992) and neurexin (Petrenko et al., 1991; Hata et al., 1993). The interaction between synaptotagmin I and syntaxin is particularly interesting, first because syntaxin is a component of the synaptic core complex that has been proposed to mediate most types of intracellular ¨ membrane fusion (Sollner et al., 1993); second, because syntaxin is one of the specific targets for chlostridial neurotoxins, agents that block neurotransmitter release (Blasi et al., 1993); and third, because the mode of binding is Ca2 dependent (Li et al., 1995). The Ca2 dependence of the interaction can be ascribed to the first C2 domain of synaptotagmin I (hereafter referred to as the C 2A domain) (Li et al., 1995; Kee and Scheller, 1996). Half-maximal binding of the isolated C 2A domain to syntaxin occurs at concentrations of 200 M Ca2 , in correlation with the intrinsic Ca2 affinity of the C2A domain (Shao et al., 1996) and with the Ca2 concentrations required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Heidelberger et al., 1994). C 2 domains are abundant in nature (Brose et al., 1995). Many of the proteins bearing C 2 domains participate in membrane traffic or signal transduction, and several of them have been shown to have Ca2 -dependent activities (Clark et al., 1991; Newton, 1993; Yamaguchi et al., 1993). Thus, understanding how the C2A domain interacts with syntaxin in a Ca2 -dependent manner should not only help to clarify how synaptotagmin I functions but can also provide a model for how protein­ protein interactions involving other C2 domains are regulated by Ca2 . The crystal structure of the C 2A domain has been solved and consists of an eight-stranded sandwich fold (Sutton et al., 1995). Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have recently shown that the C2A domain contains a novel bipartite Ca2 -binding motif involving five aspartate residues located on two loops at the tip of the sandwich (Shao et al., 1996). This study also showed that Ca2 binding does not produce substantial conformational changes in the C2A domain, raising the question of what is the driving force for the Ca2 -dependent interaction between the C2A domain and syntaxin. We have now used NMR spectroscopy in combination with site-directed

Summary Synaptotagmin I is a synaptic vesicle protein that is thought to act as a Ca2 sensor in neurotransmitter release. The first C2 domain of synaptotagmin I (C2A domain) contains a bipartite Ca2 -binding motif and interacts in a Ca2 -dependent manner with syntaxin, a central component of the membrane fusion complex. Analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis shows that this interaction is mediated by the cooperative action of basic residues surrounding the Ca2 -binding sites of the C2A domain and is driven by a change in the electrostatic potential of the C2A domain induced by Ca2 binding. A model is proposed whereby synaptotagmin acts as an electrostatic switch in Ca2 -triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis, promoting a structural rearrangement in the fusion machinery that is effected by its interaction with syntaxin. Introduction Synaptic vesicle docking and Ca2 -triggered exocytosis are central events in neurotransmission. Extensive research in the last few years has led to the identification of several proteins that regulate these processes (reviewed by Kelly, 1993; Bajjalieh and Scheller, 1995; Sudhof, ¨ 1995), but the specific roles of many these proteins remain unclear. Detailed structural characterization of the interactions among the different components of the exocytotic apparatus and how they are regulated by Ca2 will shed light on the mechanism of neurotransmitter release. Increasing evidence supports the notion that the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin is the Ca2 receptor in exocytosis (Sudhof and Rizo, 1996). It is thus ¨ particularly important to understand the interactions involving this protein. Synaptotagmin I is an abundant and highly conserved synaptic vesicle protein that contains a short intravesicular N-terminal domain, a single transmembrane sequence, and a 40-kDa cytoplasmic region (Perin et al., 1990, 1991a, 1991b). Most of the cytoplasmic region is formed by two repeats that are homologous to the C 2 domain of protein kinase C (PKC). Synaptotagmin I purified from rat brain (Brose et al., 1992) and a recombinant

mutagenesis to study the structural basis for this interaction. We find that basic residues surrounding the Ca2 -binding sites of the C2A-domain mediate the interaction with syntaxin and that binding is induced by a change in the electrostatic potential of the C2A domain upon Ca2 binding. These results suggest a model whereby synaptotagmin I triggers neurotransmitter release acting as an electrostatic switch. Results The C2 A Domain Binds to Syntaxin 1a through Its Ca2 -Binding Loops 1 H-15 N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra provide a powerful tool to study protein­protein interactions (see, for instance, Gronenborn and Clore, 1993). In these spectra, a cross­peak correlating an amide proton to its directly bonded 15N atom is observed for each nonproline residue in the sequence. Because amide 1H and 15 N chemical shifts are very sensitive to the chemical environment, the 1H-15N HSQC cross-peak patterns can be considered like protein fingerprints, and changes in these fingerprints can be used to map binding sites in proteins. We have applied this strategy to analyze what region of the C2A domain binds to syntaxin by using the cross-peak assignments that we have recently obtained for the 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of the C 2A domain in the absence and presence of Ca2 (Shao et al., 1996). We first acquired 1H-15 N HSQC spectra of uniformly 15 N-labeled C2A domain of synaptotagmin I (residues 140­267) in the presence of an excess of the isolated

cytoplasmic region of syntaxin 1a (residues 1­265; Syx1265). Syx1-265 was unlabeled, so that only signals from the C2A domain were observed. These experiments were performed at pH 7.7 and 25 C for optimal protein solubility. The HSQC spectrum observed in the absence of Ca2 (Figure 1A) was identical to that obtained in the absence of Ca2 and Syx1-265, showing that there is no protein­protein interaction in the absence of Ca2 . Upon addition of 10 mM Ca2 , a dramatic broadening of most HSQC cross peaks was observed (Figure 1B). Such broadening, which is not observed upon addition of Ca2 in the absence of Syx1-265 (see Shao et al., 1996), demonstrates the formation of a C2A domain­ Syx1-265 complex. The reversibility of the Ca2 -dependent C2A domain­Syx1-265 interaction was shown after addition of 20 mM EGTA, which yielded an HSQC spectrum identical to that in Figure 1A. To map the region of the C2A domain that binds to syntaxin 1a, we used Ca2 -saturated C2A domain and analyzed the changes in its HSQC spectrum produced by progressive addition of Syx1-265. This analysis was hindered, however, by the very severe resonance broadening produced by Syx1-265 even at low Syx1-265/C2A domain ratios. Such broadening is a natural consequence of the slower tumbling rate of the C2 A domain­ Syx1-265 complex compared with that of the monomeric C2 A domain but was compounded by the tendency of Syx1-265 to aggregate and to form an intermolecular disulfide bond that could not be completely reduced even in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). To overcome these problems, we obtained three additional syntaxin 1a fragments: first, a mutant of the isolated

The protein concentrations were as follows (percentage of syntaxin 1a fragment in parenthesis): (A) 0.4 mM 2H- 15N­C2A domain, 0.1 mM CS-Syx1-265 (25%); (B) 0.2 mM 2H- 15N­C2 A domain, 0.35 mM Syx222-250 (175%); (C) 0.4 mM 2H- 15N­C2 A domain, 0.1 mM Syx1-177 (25%); (D) 0.35 mM 2H- 15N­C2A domain, 0.23 mM Syx1-177 (65%). All spectra were acquired at 25 C in 40 mM perdeuterated Tris (pH 7.7), 100 mM NaCl, and 15 mM CaCl2. Cross peaks with the largest shifts induced by the syntaxin 1a fragments have been labeled. The cross peak labeled in (D) with an asterisk corresponds to an N-terminal sequence from the expression vector used and is likely to be shifted because of the proximity of the N-terminus of the C2A domain to the Ca2 -binding region.

cytoplasmic region where the single cysteine residue (C145) was replaced by a serine (CS-Syx1-265); second, a synthetic peptide containing residues 222­250 (Syx222-250), which includes the C-terminal region that had been found to be required for binding to the C2A domain (Kee and Scheller, 1996); and third, an N-terminal fragment containing residues 1­177 (Syx1-177) derived from proteolytic degradation of Syx1-265. In addition, since perdeuteration has been shown to sharpen protein resonances substantially by decreasing the number of possible relaxation pathways (LeMaster and Richards, 1988), titration experiments with all of the syntaxin 1a fragments were performed on perdeuterated 15N-labeled C2A domain (2H-15N­C2A domain) that was purified in H 2O so that the amide groups were protonated and thus observable in HSQC spectra. Expansions of some of the HSQC spectra of 2H-15 N­C2A domain obtained in the presence of different percentages of either CS-Syx1265, Syx222-250, or Syx1-177 are shown in Figure 2), superimposed with HSQC spectra of the 2H-15N­ C2A domain obtained before addition of the syntaxin 1a fragments. The expansions correspond to a region of the spectra where some of the largest cross-peak shifts were observed. Progressive addition of CS-Syx1-265 to 2H-15N-labeled C2A domain produced HSQC cross-peak shifts analogous to those caused by Syx1-265 but somewhat less severe broadening. Good-quality data were obtained up to a CS-Syx1-265/2 H-15 N­C2A domain ratio of 0.25 (Figure 2A), but severe broadening still prevented complete analysis of HSQC cross-peak shifts at higher CSSyx1-265/2H-15N­C2A domain ratios. Surprisingly, addition of an excess of the C-terminal Syx222-250 fragment

to the 2H-15N­C2A domain caused only very small HSQC cross-peak shifts (Figure 2B), showing that binding of this fragment is very weak. In contrast, the N-terminal Syx1-177 fragment bound quantitatively to the 2H-15 N­ C 2A domain, causing cross-peak shifts analogous to those induced by Syx1-265 and CS-Syx1-265. This is illustrated by the HSQC spectrum obtained with a Syx1177/ 2H-15N­C2A domain ratio of 0.25 (Figure 2C), which reveals very similar cross-peak shifts to those observed for the same CS-Syx1-265/2H15 N­C2A domain ratio (Figure 2A). These results show that the N-terminal 1­177 region of syntaxin 1a plays a major role in Ca2 -dependent binding to the C2A domain, although we cannot discard that the C-terminal 178­265 region may also participate in the interaction. The amount of resonance broadening caused by the Syx1-177 fragment was much less severe than that produced by the whole cytoplasmic region of syntaxin 1a (either Syx1-265 or CS-Syx1-265) because of a lower tendency to aggregate. Thus, we were able to perform a more complete titration with this fragment. All HSQC cross peaks could be monitored up to a Syx1-177/ 2 H-15 N­C2A domain ratio of 0.65, as shown in the expansion of Figure 2D where the very broad cross peak corresponding to His-237 can still be observed. Many cross peaks could be monitored even after addition of excess Syx1-177 fragment. The 1 H and 15N amide chemical shift changes induced by binding of Syx1-177 to the C2A domain in the presence of Ca2 are summarized in Figure 3. These chemical shift changes can be used to map the region of the C2A domain that binds to syntaxin 1a, since the Syx1-265, CS-Syx1-265, and Syx1-177 fragments all induce analogous HSQC cross-peak shifts.

Figure 3. Cross-Peak Shifts in the 1H- 15N HSQC Spectrum of the C2 A Domain Induced by Ca2 -Dependent Binding of Syntaxin 1a The frequency changes for backbone amide 1 H and 15N nuclei of the C2 A domain caused by binding of syntaxin 1a ( v v(bound) v(free)) are plotted as a function of residue number. Most cross-peak shifts were calculated from a 1 H-15N HSQC spectrum obtained with 0.4 mM 2 H-15N­C2A domain and 0.45 mM Syx1-177 (110% Syx1-177), and a few shifts were obtained by extrapolation from 1H- 15N HSQC spectra obtained with Syx1-177/ 2 H- 15N­C 2A domain ratios ranging from 0% to 65%. Cross-peak shifts smaller than the digital resolution of the spectra were assigned to zero. The location in the sequence of the C2A domain of the loops referred to in the text (loops 1, 2, and 3 represented in the figure as L1, L2, and L3) and of the strands is indicated.

A total of 13 cross peaks had substantial Syx1-177induced chemical shift changes ( v(1H) and/or v(15N) 20 Hz). The corresponding residues have been colored in orange on the space-filling model of the structure of the C2A domain shown in Figure 4A). In addition, 11 cross peaks had small but significant shifts ( v(1H) and/ or v(15N) between 10 Hz and 20 Hz), and the corresponding residues have been colored in yellow (note that the two C-terminal residues, E266­K267, exhibit small changes but are not displayed because they were unstructured in the crystal structure). All the residues exhibiting the largest changes are located in the region containing the Ca2 -binding sites of the C2A domain and belong to the loops formed by residues 170­180 (loop 1) and 229­240 (loop 3). Residues with smaller changes are located at the boundaries of this region, which include residues from the strands connected by loop 1 and by loop 3, from the loop formed by residues 198­202 (loop 2), and from both the N- and the C-termini. Although the cross peaks of five residues in loops 1 and 3 could not be observed owing to fast exchange with the solvent (colored in cyan in Figure 4A), the NMR data identify unambiguously the region surrounding the Ca2 binding sites as the syntaxin 1a­binding region, both because all shifts are observed in this region and because no shifts are observed in the remainder of the molecule. Loop 3 appears to play a key role in the interaction, since all observable amide groups in residues 230 to 239 exhibit substantial chemical shift changes, with the largest changes in the molecule occurring around Asp-238. This aspartate residue coordinates only the low affinity Ca2 ion, which has unsatisfied coordination sites (Shao et al., 1996). These observations suggest that syntaxin 1a may complete the coordination sphere of this Ca2 ion, implying a direct involvement of Ca2 in mediating the protein­protein interaction.

Basic Residues Surrounding the Ca2 -Binding Sites of the C2A Domain Mediate Its Ca2 -Dependent Binding to Syntaxin 1a While shifts in cross peaks from backbone amide protons help to map the region of a protein that binds to another protein, further insight into the nature of the interaction can be obtained from the analysis of the characteristics of the exposed residues in the interacting surfaces, since protein­protein interactions are usually mediated to a large extent by surface-exposed side chains. This is particularly likely for the C2A domain­ syntaxin 1a interaction, because the chemical shift changes caused by syntaxin 1a binding to the C2A domain are in general small, indicating that few local rearrangements occur in the backbone of the C2 A domain at the interacting surface. The five aspartate residues that bind Ca2 in the C2A domain are located in loops 1 and 3 and are clustered to form a highly negatively charged region. These five aspartate residues are surrounded by four basic residues and one histidine from loops 2 and 3, forming a ring of positive charges around the Ca2 -binding sites (Figure 4B). Thus, the electrostatic potential in the region is zwitterionic in the absence of Ca2 but changes drastically upon Ca2 binding, becoming largely positive (Figures 4C and 4D). On the other hand, although the region of syntaxin 1a that binds to the C 2A domain has not yet been defined, a characteristic feature of this protein is that it is very abundant in acidic residues, some of which are clustered in different regions of the molecule (Inoue et al., 1992; Bennett et al., 1992). These observations led us to hypothesize that binding of syntaxin 1a to the C2A domain is induced by the change in electrostatic potential caused by Ca2 binding and that the basic residues around the Ca2 -binding sites of the C2A domain may be directly involved in the protein­protein

In (A) the 13 residues with substantial syntaxin 1a­induced chemical shift changes ( v(1H) and/or v(15N) 20 Hz) are colored in orange (D172, G175, T176, S177, D178, Y180, D230, F231, D232, S235, H237, D238, and I239), the 11 residues with small but significant shifts ( v(1 H) and/or v(15N) between 10 Hz and 20 Hz) are colored in yellow (E140, K142, I162, L168, A170, T195, K200, Y229, K244, E266, and K267), and the five residues that could not be monitored owing to fast amide proton exchange with the solvent are colored in cyan (M173, G174, R233, F234, and K236); the locations of the N- and C-termini are indicated.

interaction. Note that although two of these basic side chains (Arg-199 and Lys-200) are from loop 2, where only small chemical shift changes were observed, they are very close to the region with largest syntaxin 1ainduced changes; since these side chains are long and flexible, they could easily project toward this region to form salt bridges at the C2A domain­syntaxin 1a interface with little perturbation of their backbone amide protons. The importance of electrostatic interactions for binding of syntaxin 1a to the C2 A domain was tested by adding NaCl (500 mM final concentration) at the end of the titrations of 2H-15N­C2A domain with syntaxin 1a fragments. Addition of salt resulted in all cases in substantial sharpening of the HSQC cross peaks of the 2 H-15N­C2A domain, indicating decreased binding of the syntaxin 1a fragments (data not shown). The observed chemical shifts showed at the same time that the C2 A domain still binds Ca2 under these conditions. To test the participation of the basic residues around the Ca2 -binding sites of the C2A domain in binding to syntaxin 1a, we generated three single mutants of the C2A domain, where Arg-199, Arg-233, and Lys-236 were individually replaced by Gln (R199Q, R233Q, and K236Q), and two double mutants (R199Q-R233Q and

R199Q-K236Q). A mutation of Lys-190, which is located in another highly basic region of the C 2A domain that is far from the Ca2 -binding sites (Figure 4B), was also tested (K190Q). To determine whether the mutant C 2A domains are properly folded, we prepared soluble samples of wild-type and mutant C2A domains and analyzed them by circular dichroism (CD). The CD spectrum of the wild-type C2 A domain is characteristic of a sheet protein and undergoes a slight change upon Ca2 binding (Figure 5A). As shown in Figures 5B­5G, the mutant C 2A domains have very similar CD spectra to that of wild-type C2 A domain and exhibit analogous spectral changes. Thus, all mutant C 2A domains are well-folded Ca2 -binding proteins. Slight differences among the CD spectra of the wildtype and mutant C 2A domains can be attributed to differences in their stability. The change in the CD spectrum of the wild-type C 2A domain upon Ca2 binding arises from the different stabilities of the Ca2 -free and Ca2 bound forms (Shao et al., 1996), which denature at 55 C and 74 C, respectively (Figure 6A). For comparison, we tested the stabilities of the R199Q, R233Q, and K236Q single mutants. As shown in Figures 6B­6D, the Ca2 free forms of the three single mutants are less stable than the wild type, denaturing at 46 C­50 C, while their

Ca2 -bound forms denature at 80 C­83 C and hence are more stable than the wild type. These observations indicate that the three single mutants have higher Ca2 affinity than the wild-type C2A domain, which was not unexpected, since the mutants bear one less positive charge than the wild type near the Ca2 -binding sites. To estimate the Ca2 affinities of all the single and double mutants, we titrated the CD spectral changes as a function of Ca2 concentration (data not shown). Half-maximal Ca2 binding for all mutants occurs at lower Ca2 concentrations than for the wild-type C2A domain, which exhibits half-maximal binding at 200 M Ca2 . In particular, the K236Q mutant has the highest affinity among the single mutants, titrating at 50 M Ca2 . Note that in the crystal structure of the C2A domain (Sutton et al., 1995), Lys-236 is forming a salt bridge with Asp-238, which is one of the aspartate side chains that was later found to participate in binding to the low affinity Ca2 ion (Shao et al., 1996). The two double mutants, which bear two positive charges less than the wild type, also titrate at 50 M Ca2 . Ca2 -dependent binding of the wild-type and mutant C 2A domains to syntaxin 1a was tested by using C 2A domains fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) that were immobilized on glutathione­agarose beads. The fusion proteins were incubated in the absence and in the presence of 1 mM Ca2 with brain homogenate and analyzed by immunoblotting for syntaxin 1a (Figure 7). A mutant C2 A domain containing a substitution in one of the aspartate side chains participating in Ca2 binding (D230N) was used as a negative control. As observed previously (Li et al., 1995), the wild-type C2 A domain exhibited Ca2 -dependent binding to syntaxin 1a, while the D230N mutant did not. Among the C2A domains containing single mutations in basic residues, Ca2 dependent syntaxin 1a binding was impaired only for the R233Q mutant. However, binding of the two proteins was almost completely abolished for the two double mutants. As shown above, the R233Q single mutant and the two double mutants are well-folded proteins with a higher Ca2 affinity than the wild-type C2A domain; hence, their reduced affinity for syntaxin 1a must be attributed to the mutations introduced. Altogether, these

results demonstrate that Ca2 -dependent binding of the C2A domain to syntaxin 1a involves the cooperative action of several of the basic residues that surround the Ca2 -binding sites and that Arg-233 is particularly critical for binding. Note that Arg-233 is in the center of loop 3, which the NMR data suggested to play a key role in the binding interaction. Discussion A detailed understanding of the protein­protein interactions involved in Ca2 -evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis is critical to elucidate the mechanism of neurotransmitter release. The interaction between the C2A domain of synaptotagmin I and syntaxin analyzed here may be crucial for the events that take place after Ca2 influx into the presynaptic terminal. This interaction requires the same Ca2 concentrations that trigger exocytosis (Li et al., 1995; Heidelberger et al., 1994) and involves two proteins that appear to play key roles in neurotransmitter release: synaptotagmin I as the Ca2

Figure 7. Ca2 -Dependent Binding of Wild-Type and Mutant C2A Domains to Syntaxin 1a Syntaxin 1a binding was assayed by incubating wild-type and mutant GST­C2 A domain fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione­agarose with total brain extracts in 1 mM EGTA or 1 mM Ca2 (Li et al., 1995). The beads were washed and analyzed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against syntaxin 1a (above), followed by staining of the filter with Ponceau S (below); the latter shows that comparable amounts of fusion proteins were present in all assays. The slightly increased syntaxin binding observed for the K236Q mutant with respect to wild-type C2A domain may arise from a more efficient saturation with Ca2 under the conditions of the experiment, since this mutant has a substantially higher affinity for Ca2 .

receptor in this process (Sudhof and Rizo, 1996) and ¨ syntaxin as a central component of the core complex that is believed to mediate most types of intracellular ¨ membrane fusion (Sollner et al., 1993). The Ca2 dependence of the interaction correlates with the Ca2 affinity that we have recently determined for the C2A domain (Shao et al., 1996), which at the same time supports the proposed role of synaptotagmin I as the Ca2 receptor in exocytosis. The results for mutant C2A domains described here show that a single mutation (e.g., K236Q) can significantly increase the affinity of the C2A domain for Ca2 ; thus, the wild-type C 2A domain appears to be designed to respond to Ca2 at the higher concentrations present during exocytosis. Through NMR analysis of 2H-15N-labeled C2 A domain in the presence of unlabeled syntaxin 1a fragments, we have demonstrated that the C 2A domain binds syntaxin 1a in a Ca2 -dependent manner via the apical loops that also form the Ca2 -binding motif of the C2A domain. This result agrees well with our previous finding that Ca2 binding does not induce substantial conformational changes in the C2A domain (Shao et al., 1996), which implied that local effects produced in the Ca2 -binding region should be responsible for the change in the affinity of the C2A domain for syntaxin upon Ca2 binding. Ca2 binding changes the electrostatic potential around the Ca2 -binding loops (Figures 4C and 4D), since four positive charges are added to a negatively charged cluster of aspartate side chains. This cluster is surrounded by a ring of basic residues, and, on the other hand, syntaxin 1a is very abundant in acidic residues. These observations strongly suggest that electrostatic interactions provide a main driving force for the Ca2 -dependent binding of the C 2A domain to syntaxin. The Ca2 induced syntaxin 1a­binding experiments with mutant C2A domains described here confirm this proposal and show that the interaction requires the concerted action of several basic residues surrounding the Ca2 -binding sites of the C 2A domain, in particular Arg-233.

The involvement of Arg-233 in syntaxin 1a binding supports the conclusion deduced from the NMR data that loop 3 is critical for the interaction. Interestingly, several residues in this loop are conserved in the first C 2 domains of proteins containing two C2 domains but are not conserved in the second C 2 domains of the same proteins (Sudhof and Rizo, 1996), and Ca2 -dependent ¨ binding to syntaxin 1a is exhibited by the first C2 domain of synaptotagmin I but not by its second C 2 domain. These observations suggest that the amino acid sequence of loop 3 confers specificity to the C 2A domain­ syntaxin 1a interaction. It is likely that, in addition to the basic residues, other side chains of this loop that are highly exposed (e.g., Phe-234 and Ser-235; see Figure 4B) also participate in binding. The second Ca2 ion bound to the C2 A domain, which contains unsatisfied coordination sites (Shao et al., 1996), may also participate directly in binding to syntaxin 1a. This is supported by the observation of the largest chemical shift changes around Asp-238. All together, our results suggest that the interacting surfaces of syntaxin 1a and the C 2A domain may be complementary in shape and may largely fit in the absence of Ca2 but are repelled owing to the presence of negative charges on both surfaces. Upon binding of two Ca2 ions, the electrostatic potential of the Ca2 -binding region of the C 2A domain becomes strongly positive, and the two surfaces are attracted (Figure 8). A sequence of protein­protein interactions mediates vesicle docking, priming, and fusion (see Sudhof, 1995). ¨ Docking and priming probably involve formation and disassembly of a complex that includes syntaxin, synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25, leading to a metastable state that is almost ready to fuse but needs the Ca2 trigger to proceed. On the basis of our data, we propose a model whereby synaptotagmin I functions as an electrostatic switch in Ca2 -evoked fusion (Figure 8). The central features of this model are that binding of the C2A domain of synaptotagmin I to syntaxin is hindered in

Figure 8. Model Showing How Synaptotagmin I May Act As an Electrostatic Switch in Ca2 -Evoked Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis The synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin I (Syt) and the plasma membrane protein syntaxin 1a (Syx) are shown in possible relative orientations before and after Ca2 influx into the presynaptic terminal (C2 A and C2B represent the first and second C2 domains of synaptotagmin I, respectively). The key points of this model are, first, that priming leads to a metastable state that is ready to fuse, but the interaction between the C2 A domain of synaptotagmin I and syntaxin is hindered by electrostatic repulsion before Ca2 influx (left), and second, that Ca2 binding to the C2A domain attracts syntaxin, causing a structural rearrangement in the membrane fusion complex that includes syntaxin 1a, turning fusion on. The Ca2 -dependent C2A domain­syntaxin 1a interaction is reversible (hence the double arrow), but, in vivo, the structural rearrangement of the fusion complex may not be reversible.

proteins have been shown to participate in Ca2 -dependent interactions (Clark et al., 1991; Newton, 1993; Yamaguchi et al., 1993). The study of the interaction between syntaxin 1a and the C 2A domain of synaptotagmin I presented here is the first analysis of the mechanism of Ca2 -dependent binding of a C2 domain to a target protein described. This analysis provides a model for how other proteins containing C2 domains may exert their functions and for how specificity in their binding interactions may be achieved.
Experimental Procedures Protein Fragments The plasmids encoding the GST fusions with the first C2 domain of rat synaptotagmin I (residues 140­267) and with the cytoplasmic region of syntaxin 1a (residues 1­265) have been described previously (Davletov and Sudhof, 1993; McMahon and Sudhof, 1995). ¨ ¨ C2A-domain mutants were generated with overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using high fidelity pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). For constructs with single mutations (K190Q, R199Q, R233Q, K236Q), pairs of oligonucleotide primers were designed at each mutation site with the intended substitution. The first round of PCR was performed from each end of the C2A domain to the mutation site, and overlapping PCR was performed subsequently across the entire C2A domain. Restriction sites were engineered into the primers without changing the expressed sequences to aid in the identification of the mutants. For K190Q, R199Q, and R233Q, a BstBI site was introduced, while an EcoRV site was introduced for K236Q. For constructs with double mutations (R199Q-R233Q and R199Q-K236Q), an internal KpnI site present between residues 199 and 233 was used to swap the sequence C-terminal to the KpnI site (incorporating either the R233Q or the K236Q mutation) with the wild-type sequence in R199Q. The mutant of the cytoplasmic region of syntaxin 1a with Cys-145 replaced by Ser was obtained by analogous methodology. All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant fusion proteins were expressed in sure cells (Stratagene) or BL21(DE3) cells and were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione­agarose beads (Sigma) as described (Smith and Johnson, 1988). Isolated soluble proteins were obtained by cleavage during 4 hr at 25 C with thrombin (0.25 mg/ml of resin) in 50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2 (pH 8.0). C2 A domains were purified by gel filtration on Superdex-75, and syntaxin 1a fragments by ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q (Pharmacia). Typical yields of pure soluble protein were 5 mg per liter of culture for wild-type and mutant C2A domains, as well as for the cytoplasmic region of syntaxin 1a. Uniformly 15N-labeled wild-type C2A domain was obtained by expression in M9 minimal medium containing 15 NH 4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. To obtain perdeuterated 15Nlabeled C2 A domain, M9 minimal medium was prepared with D2O (99.9% D) as the solvent. The yields of pure soluble protein did not decrease significantly when these media were used. The Syx1-177 fragment results from slow proteolytic degradation of Syx1-265 during cleavage of the GST fusion protein with thrombin. Only a small amount of degradation occurs during normal reaction time (4 hr), but a 50% yield of Syx1-177 fragment was obtained by prolonging the treatment with thrombin for 36 hr. Pure Syx1-177 fragment was obtained through ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q, and its identity was established by N-terminal peptide sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry. The Syx222-250 peptide was obtained by conventional peptide synthesis methods, purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and characterized by peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry. Circular Dichroism and Thermal Denaturation CD spectra and thermal denaturation curves were recorded on an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter using a 1 mm path length cell. CD spectra were recorded from 195 nm to 260 nm in 1 nm steps on 8 M C2A-domain samples in 10 mM Tris at pH 7.7 and 25 C. Ca2 binding was tested by recording spectra in the presence of

the primed state by electrostatic repulsion and that Ca2 binding to the C 2A domain upon Ca2 influx produces a drastic change in the electrostatic potential of the region around the Ca2 -binding sites, which attracts syntaxin and causes a structural rearrangement of the primed state, turning fusion on. The second C2 domain of synaptotagmin I does not appear to bind syntaxin in the presence of Ca2 (Kee and Scheller, 1996) but contains a Ca2 -dependent activity (Sugita et al., 1996) and thus may also help triggering the conformational rearrangement. Note that the N- and C-termini of the C 2A domain, which are both slightly affected by syntaxin 1a binding, are located close to the Ca2 -binding region (Figure 4A). This topology could facilitate the cooperative participation of the whole cytoplasmic region of synaptotagmin I in triggering neurotransmitter release upon Ca2 entry into the presynaptic terminal. Our NMR analysis has allowed us to formulate a hypothesis that we have confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analysis, yieding specific information on residues of the C2A domain that participate in the Ca2 -dependent interaction with syntaxin 1a. This information can now be used in the design of in vivo experiments to clarify further the function of synaptotagmin. For instance, the availability of synaptotagmin I knockout mice (Geppert et al., 1994), and of null synaptotagmin alleles in Drosophila (Littleton et al., 1993; DiAntonio and Schwarz, 1994) and C. elegans (Nonet et al., 1993), makes it feasible to perform rescue experiments with synaptotagmins bearing mutations in the Ca2 -binding aspartate residues of the C2 A domain or in the basic residues around them (note that all of these residues are conserved in these species). These experiments should allow us to dissect the role in vivo of Ca2 binding to the C 2A domain and of the C2A domain­ syntaxin interaction from other roles that synaptotagmin may play. In addition to synaptotagmin I, there are many other proteins containing C2 domains, and several of these

0.2 mM EGTA or 5 mM Ca2 . Thermal denaturation curves were obtained on analogous samples monitoring the CD absorption at 204 nm. The fraction of unfolded protein at each temperature was If)/(I u If ), where Iobs is the calculated by using the formula (Iobs observed signal intensity, and Iu and If are the signal intensities of the unfolded and folded states, respectively. Iu and If were calculated by extrapolation of the linear regions of the unfolding curves. Ca2 titrations of the CD spectral changes were performed under analogous conditions, using Ca2 concentrations that ranged from 5 M to 5 mM.

NMR Spectroscopy All NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity-500 spectrometer, operating at a proton frequency of 500 MHz. Initial 1 H-15N HSQC spectra (Bodenhausen and Ruben, 1980) were acquired by using a 2 ms purge pulse to suppress the water resonance (Messerle et al., 1989) on a 0.3 mM sample of uniformly 15N-labeled C2 A domain and 0.5 mM unlabeled Syx1-265 at 25 C in H2 O/D2O 9:1 containing 40 mM perdeuterated Tris (pH 7.7) and 100 mM NaCl. A first 1 H-15N HSQC spectrum was obtained in the presence of 1 mM EGTA, a second after adding 10 mM CaCl2 to the same sample, and a third after adding 20 mM EGTA. Parallel experiments were performed in the absence of Syx1-265. Subsequent 1H-15N spectra for titrations of 2H15N­C2 A domain with syntaxin 1a fragments were acquired by using a sensitivity-enhanced pulsed-field gradient pulse sequence including a water flip-back pulse (Zhang et al., 1994). The spectral widths in all 1H- 15N HSQC spectra were 7600 Hz and 1163 Hz in the 1 H and 15N dimensions, respectively. A low frequency filter in the time domain after data acquisition was used to remove the residual water resonance (Marion et al., 1989). Data sets consisted of 2 100 FIDs of 768 complex points each and were zero-filled to yield real matrices of 512 512 points, after Fourier transformation and removal of the aliphatic half of the spectra in the F2 dimension (digital resolution, 7.4 Hz in F2 and 2.3 Hz in F1). Processing was done with the program Felix (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). The number of transients per FID ranged from 16 to 128 scans for total acquisition times of 1.3 hr to 10 hr. Titrations of the 2H- 15N­C2 A domain with syntaxin 1a fragments monitored by 1 H-15N HSQC spectra were performed at 25 C in H2O/ D2O 9:1 containing 40 mM perdeuterated Tris (pH 7.7), 100 mM NaCl, and 15 mM CaCl2. These Ca2 concentrations are necessary to saturate the C2A domain completely (note that half-maximal Ca2 binding occurs at 200 M Ca2 ; see Shao et al., 1996). Titrations of different samples of 2 H-15N­C2A domain (0.5 mM initial concentration) were performed by progressively adding 0.5 mM solutions of syntaxin 1a fragments. Ratios of Syx1-265/2H15N­C2A domain and CS-Syx1-265/2 H15N­C2 A domain ranged from 0% to 30%, and ratios of Syx1-177/2H- 15N­C2 A domain ranged from 0% to 110%. Additional 1 H- 15N HSQC spectra of the final samples and of a sample of 2H- 15N­C A domain free of syntaxin 1a were acquired after adding 2 NaCl to a final concentration of 500 mM. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were also acquired for a 0.2 mM 2H- 15N­C2 A domain sample before and after addition of the Syx222-250 peptide to a final concentration of 0.35 mM (175% Syx222-250/2H- 15N­C2A domain ratio). Cross-peak shifts induced by the different syntaxin 1a fragments in the 1 H-15N HSQC spectra of the 2H- 15N­C2 A domain were analyzed by comparison with the spectra acquired on the corresponding 2 H-15N­C2A domain samples just before addition of the syntaxin 1a fragments. The frequencies of the cross peaks were obtained by using the automatic peak-picking routines of the program Felix for cross peaks with resolved maxima and manually for cross-peaks with severe overlap. For the titration with Syx1-177, careful examination of expanded superpositions of all the spectra allowed reliable monitoring of all cross peaks, even in crowded regions of the spectra.
