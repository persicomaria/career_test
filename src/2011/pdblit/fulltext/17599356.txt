Abstract The matrix metalloproteinases(MMP)-2 and -9, also known as the gelatinases have been long recognized as major contributors to the proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix during tumor invasion. In the recent years, a plethora of non-matrix proteins have also been identified as gelatinase substrates thus significantly broadening our understanding of these enzymes as proteolytic executors and regulators in various physiological and pathological states including embryonic growth and development, angiogenesis and tumor progression, inflammation, infective diseases, degenerative diseases of the brain and vascular diseases. Although the effect of broadspectrum inhibitors of MMPs in the treatment of cancer has been disappointing in clinical trials, novel mechanisms of gelatinase inhibition have been now identified. Inhibition of the association of the gelatinases with cell-surface integrins appears to offer highly specific means to target these enzymes without inhibiting their catalytic activity in multiple cell types including endothelial cells, tumor cells and leukocytes. Here, we review the multiple functions of the gelatinases in cancer, and especially their role in the tumor cell migration and invasion. D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Gelatinases and other matrix metalloproteinases The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are not only involved in the mechanical removal of structural proteins in the extracellular matrix. They are also able to regulate multiple cellular functions including cell growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and immune response by cleaving growth factor-precursors, cell adhesion molecules and other bioactive proteins [1]. Of the MMPs, a specific subset, the gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) have been intensively studied in cancer and other diseases. MMP-2 is abundantly expressed in normal fibroblasts, endothelial and epithelial cells as well as in many transformed cells [2­ 5]. MMP-9 expression is observed in normal leukocytes as well as in transformed cells [6­ 8]. The genes encoding the gelatinases and their promoter sequences have been characterized [9,10] and these enzymes can be purified with gelatin-affinity chromatography [8,11,12]. In addition, gelatin zymography is a simple and highly sensitive technique, which allows relatively specific detection of the gelatinases and their activation status in biological samples [11]. This property has significantly aided in linking the gelatinases into various biological processes. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are highly similar enzymes in many respects, but significant differences exist in the regulation of expression, glycosylation, proenzyme activation and substrate selectivity. For example, MMP-2 is a 72-kDa nonglycosylated protein, whereas the 92-kDa MMP-9 contains two N-glycosylated sites in the prodomain and the catalytic domain [13] and a number of O-linked glycans [14,15]. Furthermore, MMP-9 exists in plasma as a monomer, complexed with neutrophil lipocalin and as a dimer, whereas MMP-2 is strictly monomeric. Despite their largely overlapping functions, MMP-2 and MMP-9 may even have opposing biological activity as illustrated by the finding that MMP-2 promotes platelet aggregation, but MMP-9 inhibits the same process [16]. 1.1. Physiological and pathological roles of gelatinases Gelatinases play a role in a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions, among which, the role in cancer has been the most extensively studied. The gelatinases are required in invasive processes during reproduction, growth and development, leukocyte mobilization and inflammation and wound healing. Increased gelatinase activity has been observed in a variety of pathological conditions including cancer, inflammation, infective dis-

eases, degenerative diseases of the brain and vascular diseases [17]. During reproduction, the cells of the implanting embryo secrete gelatinases and other MMPs [18,19]. Consequently, in some MMP-9 knockout mice strains, a reduced breeding efficiency has been observed [20]. Although MMPs are widely expressed in the developing embryos, all single MMP knockout animals generated so far are viable, with only minor developmental defects. The MMP-9-deficient mice show a delayed vascularization and ossification of the hypertrophic zones in cartilage resulting in moderate skeletal abnormalities. This phenotype is similar, although less severe than the phenotype of the membrane type (MT)1-MMP knockout mice [21,22]. Despite the high expression level of MMP-9 in leukocytes, no major immunodeficiences have been observed in MMP-9-deficient mice [17]. However, young MMP-9-deficient mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [23]. The gelatinases are also implicated in cardiovascular diseases. Loss of MMP-9 gene in atherosclerosis-prone mice reduced the growth of atherosclerotic lesions, and protected mice from the destruction of the atherosclerotic media implicating that MMP-9 is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [24]. The phenotype of MMP-2-deficient mice is relatively mild with minor defects in developmental angiogenesis and in the skeleton and joints [25,26]. However, tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in the MMP-2-deficient mice is highly reduced [25]. Significantly, MMP-2/MT1-MMP double knockout results in death of the mice immediately after birth with respiratory failure, abnormal blood vessels, and immature muscle fibers [27]. In contrast, MMP-2/MMP-9 knockout mice are viable [28,29]. These gelatinase double-knockout mice have been tested in a mycoplasma infection model in the airways. The mice did not differ from their wild type littermates in the inflammatory response, except for that they could not induce gelatinase expression. The gelatinase-deficiency did not affect leukocyte influx into the airway lumen and lung mucosa, neither was the infection-associated microvascular remodeling affected by the lack of gelatinases [28]. However, in another inflammation model, although the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs was not affected, a decreased number of inflammatory cells was found in the airway lumen of the MMP-9 and the double knockout mice due to a defect in the transepithelial chemokine gradient formation [29]. It will be interesting to see the effect of the double knockout on tumor development and metastasis.

The gelatinases participate also in wound repair [30,31] and are typically expressed from the beginning to the end of the healing process [32]. Gelatinases and other MMPs are also able to participate in the regulation of apoptosis. MMP-9 has been observed to decrease cancer-cell apoptosis [33], whereas developmental apoptosis is augmented [21]. MMP-2, or more specifically, a C-terminal naturally occurring fragment of MMP-2, can induce apoptosis in tumor and endothelial cells [34]. In addition, mice deficient in MMP-2, -3 or -9 show reduced hepatocyte apoptosis in a lethal hepatitis model [35]. 1.2. Structural features of matrix metalloproteinases MMPs can be grouped to eight classes, based on their domain structure (Fig. 1). All MMPs contain an N-terminal predomain that is required for the correct secretion of these enzymes. The predomain is followed by a prodomain. The prodomain forms an essential contact with the catalytic zinc ion and maintains the latency of the MMPs (see below). The prodomain is followed by a catalytic domain, which contains the characteristic signatures for zinc-dependent metalloenzymes. The catalytic center of MMPs contains a zinc-binding HEBXHXBGBXHS motif, where H is histidine, E is glutamic acid, B is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid, G is glycine, X is variable amino acid and S is serine. Some MMPs, such as MMP-11 contains a threonine in place of this serine residue [36]. There is also an

absolutely conserved methionine residue located close to the HEBXHXBGBXHS motif and the zinc ion. However, the role of this conserved methionine is unclear as serine or leucine mutants of this residue in MMP-2 show identical proteolytic activity towards various substrates [37]. In addition to zinc, MMPs also contain calcium ions. In the structure of proMMP-2, two calcium ions are located in the catalytic domain, and a third one in the Cterminal domain to maintain the proper architecture of the catalytic domain and to stabilize the enzyme [38,39]. All MMPs except MMP-7, MMP-23 and MMP-26 contain a hemopexin/vitronectin-like domain [40], which is linked to the catalytic domain by a short linker or a hinge region. The role of the hinge region in MMPs is unclear, although it has been reported that mutations in the MMP8 hinge region affect autoproteolysis and substrate specificity [41]. MMP-9 additionally has a unique collagen V-like insertion between the catalytic domain and the C-terminal domain. The function of this insertion is unknown, but it contains most of the O-linked glycans of MMP-9 [14,15]. The hemopexin/vitronectin-like Cterminal domain is responsible for multiple protein ­ protein interactions. It binds tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), certain MMP substrates and is involved in the MMP activation. The hemopexin-like domain also participates in the homodimerization of MMP-9 [42] and MT1-MMP [43]. Also, heterodimers of MMP-9 and MMP-1 can form through the C-terminal domain interactions [44]. Whereas MMP-7 and MMP-26 lack the hemopexin-like domain completely, MMP-23 has a cysteine- and proline-rich interleukin-1 type II receptorlike domain instead. Furthermore, MMP-23 is bound to the cell surface through a unique N-terminal signal anchor [45]. Other extra domains that are not common to all members of MMPs include the collagen-binding domain (CBD) of gelatinases and the transmembrane domains of MT-MMPs. The CBD domain is composed of three fibronectin type II like repeats and is involved in binding of collagenous substrates and elastin [46], fatty acids [47] and thrombospondins [48]. Although most of the MMPs are secreted proteins, six of them contain a transmembrane domain that is used to anchor these proteins on the cell surface. These MT-MMPs have a single pass transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain (MMP-14, -15, -16 and -24) or a glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) insertion signal (MMP-17 and -25). The first complete MMP structure to be solved was that of proMMP-2 [38]. The proMMP-2 has also been crystallized with the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 [49]. The structures of many other MMP domains are also known and these provide a scaffold for the development of MMP-binding small molecules. For example, three different partial structures of MMP-9 with the ° level of 2.5 A resolution or better have been published. One is a C-terminally deleted proMMP-9 construct lacking the

collagen V-like region and the hemopexin-like domain [50]. A catalytic domain of MMP-9 lacking the collagen-binding domain has been crystallized in the presence of a hydroxamate inhibitor [51]. The C-terminal domain is the third resolved MMP-9 structure and this structure reveals the mechanism of MMP-9 dimerization [42]. Together, these structures span the whole proMMP-9 except for the collagen V-like region. 1.3. Gelatinase substrates Gelatinase substrates include a wide variety of proteins including ECM proteins, proteinases, proteinase inhibitors, blood clotting factors, chemotactic molecules, latent growth factors and growth factor binding proteins, cell surface receptors, adhesion molecules and even intracellular substrates (Table 1). However, the relevance of these events in vivo is unclear at present. The concensus cleavage sequences of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been mapped with the substrate phage [52,53]. The substrate specificities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are similar but not identical. The most notable difference is the ability of MMP-2 to degrade native type I collagen. The difference in the substrate specificity of gelatinases has been attributed to the S2 subsite in the catalytic site, where MMP-9 contains an aspartic acid, and MMP-2 a glutamic acid [54]. The catalytic domains of MMP-2 and MMP-9 also differ in their S1V binding pockets [50,51]. These minor differences in the catalytic domain have functional consequences in the substrate selectivity of the gelatinases. The amino acid residue fitting to the S2 subsite in the gelatinase substrates appears to be a major selectivity determinant based on the cleavage sequences obtained with the substrate-phage (Table 2). Indeed, some substrates show over 200-fold selectivity towards MMP-2 over MMP-9 [52,53]. Gelatinase binding to native collagens and gelatin occurs primarily via the CBD [55], whereas other MMPs, e.g., MMP-3 utilizes the C-terminal domain for collagen binding [56]. However, gelatin binds also to the C-terminal domain of the gelatinases [57,58]. It has been shown that binding of type I collagen to the C-terminal domain and the catalytic domain of MMP-2 is sufficient for collagenolysis, whereas subsequent gelatinolysis requires the participation of the CBD [59]. The C-terminal domain of gelatinases may also bind non-collagenous substrates [60]. The residues contributing to the gelatin binding have been identified by sitedirected mutagenesis, and are located in the second fibronectin type II module of both gelatinases [61,62]. These gelatin binding residues in MMP-2 have been thoroughly examined by NMR using gelatin-mimicking (proline ­ proline-glycine)n peptides [63 ­ 65]. Peptides binding to the recombinant CBD of MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been isolated using phage display [66, 67]. Although the phage peptides binding to MMP-2 do not show significant similarity to sequences found in collagen, the MMP-9 CBD

binding peptides are similar to sequences found in fibronectin and vitronectin [67]. The three fibronectin type II repeats form a threepronged fishhook-like structure in proMMP-2 [38], and this conformation may be needed for the unwinding and complete degradation of the triple helical collagens [68]. Interestingly, these three repeats are highly autonomous and even show individual differences in substrate specificity [69]. In the proMMP-2 structure, the prodomain peptide PIIKFPGDVA interacts intramolecularly with the putative gelatin-binding site of the third fibronectin type II repeat via contacts that involve propeptide amino acid residues Ile35, Phe37 and Asp40 [38]. This binding may represent an additional mechanism in maintaining the latency of the progelatinases. It is also of interest to note that the relative affinities of the substrates to the gelatinases may vary depending on the activation status of the enzyme. ProMMP9 binds type I collagen with a higher affinity than active MMP-9, whereas the opposite is true for type IV collagen recognition [55]. The biological significance of these differences in the affinities is unclear. 1.4. Regulation of MMP activity In order to avoid unwanted tissue damage it is crucial to accurately control the protease activity. For this reason, protease activity is typically regulated at multiple levels including transcription, secretion, activation and by the action of proteinase inhibitors. MMPs including the gelatinases are no exception in this respect. A major difference between MMP-2 and MMP-9 is their differential regulation of expression [10]. Typically, MMP-2 is rather constitutively expressed with only modest up or downregulation under various conditions [70]. Instead, MMP-9 expression is highly inducible and under the control of growth factors, chemokines and other stimulatory signals [3]. These differences can be traced to the promoter elements of the gelatinases [17,71,72]. The promoter of MMP-9 is similar to most other MMPs, whereas MMP-2 promoter lacks many of the inducible promoter elements such as binding sites for the AP-1 and ETS transcription factors [72]. The differential regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression is evident in cells treated with protein kinase C activators such as phorbol esters. Whereas the expression of MMP9 is stimulated several fold, MMP-2 expression is slightly downregulated [10]. Cytokines and growth factors that activate MMP-9 expression typically act via the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which includes the ERK 1/2, JNK/SAPK 1/2 and p38 proteins [72]. These inducers include epidermal-growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-a and h, amphiregulin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1a and h, interferon (IFN)-a and g [17].

to the highly inducible nature of MMP-9 by growth factors and cytokines, MMP-9 promoter activity can be detected in invasive tumors in mice carrying a hgalactosidase gene under the control of MMP-9 promoter [73]. MMP-1, -2, -3 and MT1-MMP, but not MMP-9 expression, can also be stimulated by the extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) [74]. EMMRPIN is a cell surface glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. In addition to the MMP expression stimulating activity, EMMPRIN acts as a cell surface receptor for MMP1 [75]. Other proteins that are able to regulate the activity of MMPs include the three small integrin-binding ligand Nlinked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs); bone sialoprotein, osteopontin and dentin matrix protein-1. Bone sialoprotein specifically binds MMP-2, while osteopontin binds MMP3, and dentin matrix protein-1 binds MMP-9. Interestingly, binding of the SIBLINGS to the MMPs activates the proenzymes and reduces their susceptibility to the MMPinhibitors [76]. Besides the growth factor and chemokine-induced signals, integrin and extracellular matrix-mediated signals regulate the expression of the gelatinases and other MMPs. It was initially observed that antibodies blocking a5h1 integrin-mediated adhesion induced MMP expression in fibroblasts [77]. Later studies revealed that integrinmediated signals are general regulators of MMP expression, as a2h1 integrin regulates MMP-1 expression [78,79], antibodies to a3h1 integrin ­tetraspanin complexes induce MMP-2 expression [80], and aMh2 and a3h1 integrin ligation stimulates MMP-9 expression [81,82]. The effects

on MMP expression are very specific. For example, a4h1 integrin ligation by vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in T cells induces only MMP-2 and not MMP-9, but ligation of the same integrin to a fibronectin-derived CS-1 peptide stimulates the expression of both gelatinases [83]. Although speculative, it seems that the integrin ­ matrix interactions induce selective expression of those MMPs that are the most suitable for the modification of the underlying matrix. Leukocytes, which have to rapidly adhere to the blood vessel endothelium and extravasate into tissues, have developed an additional mechanism to control gelatinase activity. These cells have large amounts of proteasecontaining granules, which are rapidly delivered to the cell surface and excreted to the extracellular space after leukocyte activation. Due to a high MMP-9 content, one of these granule types is called as gelatinase granules, which also contain integrins [84,85]. Recent studies suggest that proMMP-9 forms intracellular complex with aMh2 integrin on these granules and this preformed complex is then transported to the cell surface following phorbol ester or chemokine activation [86]. In contrast, adherent cell types do not contain storage granules of gelatinases and are dependent on direct secretion of the newly synthesized enzymes. In endothelial and tumor cells, the gelatinases are secreted in specific transport vesicles containing also other proteins such as integrins and components of the plasminogen activation system [87 ­ 89]. Integrins appear to be required also for the delivery of these vesicles. For example, MMP-9 was not secreted into the cell culture medium of keratinocytes in the absence of a3h1 [90]. Similarly, antisense expression of aV integrin reduced MMP-9 expression in Epstein ­ Barr virus infected B lymphocytes [91] and expression of aVh6 in colon carcinoma increased secreted MMP-9 [92,93]. Also, urokinase-plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) regulates MMP-9 secretion. Antisense expression of uPAR abrogates MMP-9 expression, but not MMP-2 or integrin expression [94,95]. An inverse correlation of integrin expression and MMP expression has been observed in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells where overexpression of MT1-MMP significantly reduced and antisense expression increased aVh3 integrin expression [96].

1.5. Proenzyme activation The gelatinases are secreted as proenzymes, and they need to be activated for full catalytic activity. The activation of the gelatinases and other soluble MMPs occurs on the cell surface or in the extracellular milieu, whereas MT-MMPs may also be activated intracellularly by furin-like proprotein convertases [97,98]. In general, proteases can be activated via multiple mechanisms and commonly a reciprocal activation pattern is observed, i.e., an activated protease can activate the zymogen of its activator [99]. Hence, it is highly difficult to define the initiator protease of the activation cascades and also how the first enzyme in the cascade is activated. One possibility is that some of the proenzymes are sufficiently active for the initial cleavage. The MMPs become catalytically active when the propeptide of an MMP is cleaved or the conformation of the propeptide is disrupted. The ``cysteine switch'' principle is essential for understanding the MMP activation process (Fig. 2). MMPs contain a conserved peptide sequence PRCGXPD

in the prodomain. The cysteine residue coordinates with the catalytic zinc ion and blocks the entry of a catalytically essential water molecule to the active site [100]. The various activation mechanisms of MMPs all disrupt the interaction of the critical cysteine with the catalytic zinc atom either by removing the prodomain or by modifying the cysteine residue in the prodomain. This allows the entrance of a water molecule in the catalytic site and results in the formation of an active catalytic centre. The cysteine switch mechanism explains why MMPs can be activated by such different means as proteases, conformational perturbants such as heat, denaturants or substrate binding, heavy metals and organomercurials, oxidants and alkylating agents [100]. The main activation route of MMP-2 on the cell surface is by the formation of a molecular complex containing MMP-2, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 [101,102]. The N-terminal domain of TIMP-2 binds to and inhibits MT1-MMP, whereas the Cterminal domain of the same TIMP-2 molecule binds the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-2 forming a ternary complex. An adjacent TIMP-free MT1-MMP subsequently cleaves the MMP-2 to the intermediate 64-kDa form by cleaving the Asn37 ­ Leu38 bond located in a readily accessible bait region between the first and the second a helix of the prodomain. This intermediate form is then processed to the fully mature 62-kDa form through cleavage of the Asn80 ­Tyr81 bond by an already active MMP-2 molecule [101,102]. Only the active MT1-MMP binds MMP-2 on the cell surface, thus regulation of MT1-MMP activation is an important control point to regulate MMP-2 activity [103]. Although TIMP-2 is normally required for the MMP-2 activation, higher TIMP-2 levels lead to inhibition of MMP-2 activation. On the other hand, soluble MT1-MMP efficiently activates MMP-2 in the absence of TIMP-2 [104]. Integrins are also involved in the activation process directly or indirectly as aVh3 and h1 integrin activating antibodies modulate MMP-2 activation [105]. The direct involvement is supported by the finding that the intermediate active MMP-2 is claimed to be capable of aVh3 integrin binding, and this interaction could thus affect MMP-2 activation [106,107]. Alternatively, integrin-mediated signals may lead to the increase in MT1-MMP expression and activity and thus contribute to the MMP-2 activation. Endothelial cells cultured in a three-dimensional (3D)-collagen type I matrix express MT1-MMP with concomitant activation of MMP-2 whereas only a minor fraction of MMP-2 is activated in a 2D-collagen culture [108]. In addition, HT1080 cells cultured on fibronectin, but not on laminin-1 show increased activation of MMP-2. The activation involves integrin activity as immobilized antibodies to the fibronectin receptor a5h1 similarly induce MMP-2 activation [109]. MMP-2 can also be activated by MMP-1 and MMP-7, and the activated anti-coagulant protein C [110,111], but hardly at all with MMP-3, trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, plasma kallikrein, thrombin, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G or thermolysin [112]. However, proteases that do not directly activate MMP-2 can do so by activating MT1-MMP [113].

Cell surface activation of MMP-2 can also occur through a plasminogen-mediated mechanism, which requires the presence of MT1-MMP, but not MT1-MMP activity [96]. MMP2 activation can also be induced with the lectin concanavalin A [114]. The effect is likely mediated by inhibition of MT1MMP endocytosis from the cell surface [115]. Intracellular activation of MMP-2 has also been observed, but the mechanism has not been elucidated [116]. Several activation mechanisms for proMMP-9 have been proposed. Plasminogen/MMP-3-mediated activation is detected in many cultured cells and involves activation of plasminogen to plasmin by urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) [117]. uPA is bound to its cell surface receptor uPAR and cleaves plasminogen. Plasmin is an efficient activator of proMMP-3, which then activates MMP-9 by sequential cleavage of the Glu40 ­ Met41 and Arg87 ­ Phe88 bonds [101]. However, MMP-3 deficiency in mice does not impair MMP9 activation [118] indicating that other factors are involved in or can complement MMP-3 deficiency. ProMMP-9 can be directly activated by plasmin but this is a relatively inefficient process in solution. However, the proenzyme activation may be potentiated on the cell surface. This has been observed with plasmin [119] and MT1-MMP/MMP-2and MMP-3-mediated activation of proMMP-9 [120]. Plasmin clearly contributes to in vivo activation of MMP-9 as the uPA-deficient mice show reduced activation of MMP9, as well as that of MMP-3, -12 and -13 [121]. Human tumor-associated trypsin-2 is an efficient activator of MMP-9 [122]. MMP-9 could be activated at a 1:1000 trypsin to proMMP-9 ratio. Similarly to the MMP-3 mediated activation, the propeptide of MMP-9 was completely removed by cleavage of the Arg87 ­ Phe88 bond [122]. Chymotrypsin-like proteinase in human skin [123] and mast cell-derived a and h chymase [124,125] have also been reported to activate MMP-9. In mice lacking the mast cell chymase, activation of proMMP-9 is severely impaired [126]. In vitro, MMP-9 can also be activated by purified MMP-2 [127], MMP-3 [128], MMP-7 [129], MMP-10 [130], MMP-13 [131] and MMP-26 [132], which all yield the fully active 82 kDa MMP-9. More complexity comes from the finding that the proMMP-9 displays significant catalytic activity in the presence of the propeptide [133]. Substrate binding appears thus to be sufficient to trigger the cysteine switch and provides one possible solution to the dilemma that active MMP-9 is often not found in the tissues despite the catalytic activity of MMP-9. Neutrophils are also able to activate MMP-9 via an oxidative mechanism [134]. Additionally, it has been observed that MMP-9 can be activated by S-nitrosylation [135]. Both gelatinases can be activated via free radical-generating 2- and 4-hydroxyestradiols [136]. Organomercurials such as aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) are commonly used as MMP activators. With APMA, the propeptide of MMP-9 is not completely removed. Furthermore, a prolonged incubation with APMA results in the autolytic processing of the C-terminal domain with three successive cleavages [137].

2. Gelatinase inhibitors 2.1. Naturally occurring gelatinase inhibitors Both naturally occurring and synthetic MMP inhibitors have been identified and characterized. Some of them show significant selectivity towards the gelatinases (Table 3). The physiological inhibitors of gelatinases include a2macroglobulin and the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). a2-macroglobulin is an abundant plasma protein and effectively inhibits the activity of most proteinases, including the MMPs [138]. Binding to a2-macroglobulin is an efficient indicator of MMP activation status as only the activated enzymes bind it [139]. The a2-macroglobulin may play an important role in the endocytic removal of proteolytic enzymes [140]. The inhibitor ­ MMP complexes are internalized into cells via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and are eventually degraded. However, MMP-9 can also be internalized as a monomer

or TIMP-1 complex and MMP-2 with thrombospondin-2 apparently in the absence of a2-macroglobulin [141,142]. TIMPs are relatively small, cysteine rich proteins. They form high-affinity 1:1 complexes with the MMPs. TIMPs-1, 2, 3 and 4 vary in tissue-specific expression and their ability to inhibit various MMPs [1]. For example, TIMP-1 inhibits MMP-9 with a high affinity, whereas TIMP-2 inhibits MMP2 [143,144]. TIMPs also inhibit the activity of other metalloproteinases, namely members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family [1,145,146]. Studies with TIMP-2 knockout mice indicate that the dominant function of TIMP-2 in vivo is the activation of proMMP-2 [147]. The crystal structure of proMMP-2 with TIMP-2 reveals the interacting sites required for MMP-2 activation. The Cterminal hemopexin-like domain of MMP-2 interacts with the C-terminal domain of TIMP-2, whereas the catalytic domain of MMP-2 and the MMP inhibitory N-terminal domain of TIMP do not form contacts in this structure [49]. The MMP2/TIMP-2 complex also reveals why TIMP-1 does not

interact with MMP-2. This is because TIMP-1 lacks the critical C-terminal MMP-2-interacting residues that are present in TIMP-2 [49]. Despite the MMP-inhibitory activity of TIMPs, several studies have showed that a high level of TIMP-1 or -2 correlate with a poor prognosis in many types of cancer [148 ­ 151]. TIMPs are known to have many functions. Under some conditions, the TIMPs can inhibit tumor-cell apoptosis as well as promote cell growth and angiogenesis. For example, TIMP-4 can upregulate an antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL and stimulate mammary tumorigenesis [152]. The growth-promoting activities of TIMPs are not well understood, but are observed in many cell types and appear to be independent of MMP-inhibitory activity [153]. TIMPs have also MMP-independent cancer-inhibiting functions. TIMP-2 may directly inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis by acting through a3h1 integrin and causing a decrease in tyrosine phosphatase activity associated with this integrin [154]. TIMP-3 can directly inhibit angiogenesis through blockage of VEGF binding to the VEGF receptor-2 [155]. An interesting observation is that TIMP-1 can also be found in the nucleus [156] and may even be specifically translocated there from the cell membrane [157]. Recently, also MMP-2 was found to be present in the nucleus, and a pro-apoptotic nuclear protein, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase was cleaved by MMP-2 in vitro suggesting that MMP-2 could partially substitute for caspases in the apoptotic cascade [158]. MMP inhibiting proteins containing domains with structural similarity to TIMPs have been identified. The Cterminal fragment of the procollagen C-terminal proteinase enhancer protein was purified from human brain tumor cells due to its MMP-inhibitory activity, but it is a less potent inhibitor than the TIMPs [159]. The noncollagenous NC1 domains of collagen type IV are another protein domains with structural similarities to TIMPs [160]. Among the NC1 domains of collagen type IV, the a3 chain NC1 domain is the most potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth [161]. However, the domain also contains RGD-dependent and RGD-independent recognition sites for aVh3 and aVh5 integrins and can regulate angiogenesis through integrinmediated signaling [162]. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2, despite being a serine protease inhibitor, can also inhibit MMPs, including the gelatinases [163]. Endostatin is a collagen XVIII derived 20-kDa proteolytic fragment with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties [164]. The protease responsible for the generation of endostatin in vivo is likely cathepsin L [165], but also cathepsin B and MMPs, including MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP12, MMP-13 and MMP-20 release endostatin in vitro [166]. Endostatin acts as an inhibitor of MMP-2 activation [167] as well that of MMP-9 and MMP-13 [168]. It also inhibits the catalytic activity of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP [167]. The RECK protein (reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs) is another inhibitor of MMPs, and is the only known membrane-bound MMP inhibitor. RECK is a 110-kDa glycoprotein expressed in many normal

tissues, but is absent from transformed and tumor-derived cells [169]. RECK-transfected HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells accumulated only low levels of proMMP-9 in the culture medium and purified RECK bound MMP-9 specifically and inhibited the enzymatic activity of MMP-9 [169]. RECK is also a negative regulator of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP decreasing angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, in contrast to MMP-deficient animals, deletion of a functional RECK gene is lethal [170]. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an extracellular 450-kDa glycoprotein with anti-angiogenic properties [171]. TSP-1 directly binds MMP-9 and inhibits its activation both in vitro and in vivo [172]. Consequently, TSP-1-deficient mice show increased angiogenesis and tumor growth, which can be linked to an increased association of vascular endothelial growth factor with VEGFR-2 and appearance of active MMP-9 [172]. Contrasting activities have also been reported, as TSP-1 upregulates MMP-9 expression and stimulates invasion of endothelial cells in vitro [171]. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the thrombospondin type 1 repeats in TSP-1 and TSP-2 interact with the collagenbinding domain of MMP-2 and MMP-9 indicating the potential inhibition mechanism [48]. A few naturally occurring small-molecule inhibitors of gelatinases have been identified. Neovastat is a shark cartilage extract with anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of MMPs, although the exact nature of the active ingredient in the extract has not been reported [173]. Neovastat has multiple modes of action as it additionally inhibits many VEGF-dependent events in vivo [174]. Matlystatins are produced by an actinomycete strain Actinomadura atramentaria and inhibit gelatinases with an IC50 value less than 1 AM [175]. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) reduces MMP-9 expression and causes inhibition of Epstein ­ Barr virus latent membrane protein-1 induced invasiveness of tumor cells in vivo [176]. Aspirin also suppresses MMP-2 production and reduces in vitro invasiveness of tumor cells [177]. However, aspirin does not appear to directly inhibit gelatinases. A potential mechanism for the inhibition is the induction of the RECK protein [178]. A polyphenolic compound in green tea, epigallocatechin-3gallate, is a potent inhibitor of gelatinases, but it is not gelatinase selective as it inhibits also other MMPs [179]. Long-chain fatty acids with 10 to 18 carbon atoms inhibit both gelatinases, but only weakly other MMPs as their binding site is in the collagen-binding domain [47]. In general, the long and unsaturated fatty acids appear to be more potent than the short saturated ones [47]. However, the long-chain fatty acids are not gelatinase selective gelatinase, as they also inhibit other proteinases including neutrophil elastase and plasmin [180,181]. 2.2. Synthetic gelatinase inhibitors Most of the synthetic MMP inhibitors target the catalytic site of the MMPs and act by chelating the catalytically

essential zinc ion. Due to the huge interest in the therapeutic intervention of MMPs in cancer, over a hundred small molecule MMP inhibitors have been designed and synthesized [182]. The zinc binding groups that have been utilized in MMP inhibitors include carboxylates, aminocarboxylates, sulfhydryls, thiols, phosphoric acid derivatives and hydroxamates [182]. From these, the hydroxamate-based inhibitors are the most widely used. Batimastat (BB-94) was the first synthetic MMP inhibitor and showed potent antitumor activity in mice [183]. It is a non-orally bioavailable peptidomimetic hydroxamate inhibitor based on the MMP cleavage site in collagens [182]. The first inhibitors were followed by orally bioavailable inhibitors, such as marimastat. Many non-peptidomimetic MMP inhibitors have also been developed and tested in clinical trials, these include the compounds BAY12-9566, AG3340 and BMS-275291 [182]. Prinomastat (AG3340) is a rather selective gelatinase inhibitor, inhibiting MMP-1, -7 and -11 much less efficiently. However, it shows picomolar affinity to MT1-MMP and MMP-13 [184]. Other selective active-site inhibitors of gelatinases have also been synthesized [185]. These Nsulfonylamino acid derivatives are orally bioavailable and effectively suppress tumor growth in a mouse model, but their inhibitory profile towards other MMPs has not been completely elucidated [185]. Two related active site inhibitors with a dithiol structure have been identified as selective gelatinase inhibitors [186,187]. Due to the dithiol moiety in these chemicals, they induce a conformational change in the gelatinases, which is not easily reversible [186]. It is highly difficult to synthesize specific active site inhibitors for an individual MMP. This is because the catalytic sites of MMPs show remarkable similarity, which is also reflected by the overlapping substrate specificity of the MMPs. The X-ray structures of several MMPs have established that the S1V subsite in the catalytic site is the main determinant of the substrate specificity as well as a selectivity determinant for the inhibitors. The S1V subsites can be classified as deep pockets and shallow pockets. MMP2, -3, -8, -9, -13 and MT1-MMP contain a deep pocket, whereas MMP-1 and MMP-7 have a shallow S1V pocket [188]. Other investigators further divide the MMPs into intermediate pocket containing enzymes, where MMP-2, -8, 9 and -26 are classified as intermediate ones [189]. Differences in other sites such as the S2 site can be further utilized in order to increase the selectivity of the inhibitors [53,54]. Tetracyclines, which in addition to their antimicrobial activity inhibit inflammatory cell migration and chemotaxis to sites of inflammation, act also as MMP inhibitors. The ability of tetracyclines to inhibit MMPs is independent of their anti-microbial activity [190]. The tetracyclines act on two levels, they suppress the gelatinase expression [191] and directly inhibit gelatinase activity trough a zincchelating effect [190]. The tetracycline derivatives have entered clinical trials as MMP-inhibitors [192]. Clodronate, zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates have been developed to treat bone diseases due to their ability to

inhibit bone resorption. However, it has been also found that these compounds directly inhibit MMP activity [193]. Zoledronic acid was found recently to have an antiangiogenic effect in a mouse cervical cancer model [194]. It should also be noted that tetracyclines and bisphosphonates can be readily used as MMP inhibitors in the clinic as they are already approved drug molecules [191,193,195]. The cysteine switch peptide MRKPRCGVPDVG from the prodomain of MMP-3 was the first peptide used to block the enzymatic activity of the MMPs [196], whereas the phage display-derived CTTHWGFTLC (CTT) peptide was the first gelatinase-selective peptide inhibitor [197]. The CTT peptide did not inhibit the activity of MT1-MMP, MMP-8 or MMP-13. The mechanism how CTT inhibits gelatinase activity is not known. The CTT peptide was enriched in a biopanning with active MMP-9 and was the most potent inhibitor among the peptides containing a WGF motif. The CTT peptide inhibited the migration of several cell lines in vitro and retarded tumor progression in mouse models. It also exhibited a strong tumor homing ability in comparison to the normal tissues [197]. The targeting capability of CTT was further demonstrated with liposomes coated with the CTT peptide. These liposomes efficiently targeted gelatinase-expressing cancer cells in vitro [198]. The CTT peptide has also been used to modify the natural tropism of adenovirus for a therapeutic gene delivery in a rabbit restenosis model [199]. In addition, CTT peptide has been used to localize gelatinase activity in tissue samples using in situ zymography [200] and to evaluate the contribution of gelatinases in various biological processes including vasoconstriction, epithelial ­ mesenchymal transition and hepatitis [201 ­ 203]. There are several RNA-based strategies to inhibit the gelatinases. Ribozymes, RNA molecules with catalytic activity, have been utilized to inhibit translation of gelatinase mRNAs. Importantly, the MMP-9 down-regulated cells retained their tumorigenicity but were no longer able to metastasize [204,205]. MMP-2 has also been targeted with a ribozyme approach. MMP-2, but not MMP-9 was found to be necessary for glomerular mesangial cell proliferation and differentiation [206]. Similarly, adenoviral delivery of antisense mRNA of MMP-9 effectively suppressed tumor xenograft growth in vivo [207]. Small interfering RNAs have also been used to specifically silence MMP-9. Lack of MMP-9 caused a decrease in spreading of Ewings sarcoma cells, inhibition of chemotactic migration towards fibronectin and induction of E-cadherin-mediated cell aggregation [208]. Therapeutic inhibition of MMPs may also be achieved by other indirect means. These include targeting of extracellular factors, signal-transduction pathways or nuclear factors that are required for the transcriptional activation of MMPs. Another possibility is to inhibit the activity of the MMP activating proteases [209]. However, those strategies aiming at suppressing MMP transcription may have to take into account that the stromal cells are often the producers of the MMPs in the tumor.

3. Regulation of cell migration Cell migration is a complex process involving many types of components both intra- and extracellularly and the signaling events linking these. More specifically, cancer cell migration can be viewed as a process regulated by matrixdegrading proteinases, integrins and other cell adhesion molecules [210]. As migration is a critical event in cancer progression and especially metastasis, inhibition of cell migration represents an attractive therapeutic target. The basic concepts in cell migration are well established, but the details how these processes are regulated and executed are far from clear. The main principle of cell migration is simple; the cell must convert the intracellular forces generated by the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton to cell body translocation [211]. The cells typically migrate in response to migratory signals. This cellular response can be either non-directional movement (chemokinesis) or directed migration along a chemical concentration gradient of the signal inducer (chemotaxis). In the initial phase of cell migration, the cells polarize and extend membrane processes such as lamellipodia and filopodia at the cell front. Lamellipodia are broad, sheet-like structures whereas filopodia are thin cylindrical needle-like projections [211]. Invadopodia are a specialized form of small needle-like projections in invasive cells being located beneath the cells rather than in the cell edge in a two-dimensional culture [212]. The invadopodia have been characterized as highly dynamic structures where proteolytic degradation takes place [212 ­ 214]. Localized matrix degradation takes place also in the leading edge of the membrane extensions together with concomitant formation of nascent adhesive contacts by integrins and other adhesion molecules [211,215]. These nascent adhesive sites may further develop to mature focal contacts, which are a highly dynamic protein network containing over fifty different proteins [216]. Integrins are one of the key players in the regulation of cell migration. Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules composed of an a chain and a h chain (Fig. 3). Various combinations of the a and h chains bind specific cell surface and ECM ligands and transmit signals between the outside and inside of the cells

[217,218]. For example, a5h1 binds fibronectin, whereas the aVh5 is a vitronectin receptor. The ligand binding to integrins typically occurs through negatively charged residues present in the ligand such as the RGD motif [218,219]. The binding site of these ligands is either the I domain in the a subunit of integrins or a binding pocket formed by the a and h subunit together as visualized in the aVh3 integrin structure with the RGD peptide [220]. I domain-containing integrin a subunits are a1, a2, a10, a11, aL, aX, aD, aM and aE. All the other integrin a subunits lack an I domain [218]. Many integrins recognize a three amino acid motif RGD present in certain matrix proteins [221]. RGD containing peptides have also been found by biopanning with these integrins [222 ­ 224], whereas leukocyte h2 integrins recognize an LLG motif found by phage display [225]. Studies with the leukocyte-specific h2 integrins have provided important information about integrin structure and function [226]. These integrins are also clinically highly relevant. Consequently, antagonists of the leukocyte integrins aLh2 and aMh2 are being developed for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions [227,228]. The formation of the adhesive contacts is regulated by members of the Rho subfamily of GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac and Rho [229]. For example, the Rho protein directly controls the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers [230]. Not surprisingly, members of the rho family have frequently been associated with tumor metastasis [231 ­ 233]. Formation of the adhesive structures is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletonassociated proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin and tensin, which are important mediators of intracellular signaling [234]. FAK is a 125-kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase that can be activated through integrinmediated signals and regulates multiple functions such as cell motility, survival and proliferation [217,235]. Increased FAK expression is a potent marker for the invasiveness of human tumors [236] and inhibition of FAK signaling through overexpression of a dominant negative mutant causes tumor dormancy [95]. FAK enhances cell motility and invasion by distinct mechanisms. FAK negative fibroblasts are defective in migration, but expression of

viral Src-protein restores the motility through a reactivation of signaling through Src. The Src kinase associates with uPAR and integrins [237]. Src acts by linking FAK to integrins, such as aVh5 in VEGF mediated signaling [238]. However, invasion of FAK-negative fibroblasts and expression of the gelatinases is not restored by v-Src. To become invasive, fibroblast cells require transient accumulation of FAK in lamellipodia and formation of FAK-Src-p130CasDock180 signaling complex together with Rac activation [239]. The authors suggested that FAK activity is required for the synchronization of cell motility and invasive behavior. Recently, MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP activity was linked to proteolytic cleavage of FAK in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, it was not established if the cleavage was directly caused by the MT-MMPs [240]. Generation of new adhesive sites is necessary but not sufficient for cell migration. The cells also need a mechanism to release the adhesions in the rear of the cells. In migrating fibroblasts, a major part of the integrins is left on the substratum by a mechanism called ``membrane ripping'' [211,241]. The rest of the integrins are released from the substratum and re-distributed on the cell surface or endocytosed [242]. The mechanism of the rear release potentially involves multiple mechanisms, including mechanical stress from the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways regulating integrin affinity [211]. Proteases and protease inhibitors may contribute to this process. For example, the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 can directly cause cellular detachment by inactivating the integrins [243]. Only a few other proteins have been shown to directly participate in cell detachment, namely tenascin-C, thrombospondin-1 and -2 and SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) [244]. The proteases can also indirectly modulate the affinity and hence the detachment of the cells by processing the extracellular matrix [5] or by cleaving integrin-associated molecules [245,246]. Thus, adhesion and detachment controlled by integrin ­ ligand interactions are one of the key regulators of cell migration. Migration of cells and the speed of migration can be regulated by ligand levels, integrin levels and the integrin ­ ligand affinities. Experimentally, the migration speed is biphasic, too little or too much adhesion strength will decrease the cell velocity, irrespective if this has been obtained by increasing ligand or integrin concentration or the integrin affinity to the ligand [247]. Indeed, these studies suggest that relatively small changes in integrin expression or affinity can substantially alter the speed of migration. Furthermore, inhibition of cell migration can thus be obtained not only with integrin-function blocking antibodies but also with antibodies that induce the activation of integrins [247] and proteases that change the affinity of the matrix ligand to the integrin [248]. A possible complication in cancer therapy with cell migration inhibiting agents is that the migration mechanisms utilized by the cancerous cells and non-neoplastic cell are highly similar or identical. Migration of non-neoplastic cells

is required for example in embryogenesis, inflammation and wound healing. Hence, inhibition of these activities may have detrimental side-effects [211,249].

4. Multiple roles of proteinases in cell migration and invasion Tumor invasion is defined as penetration of the tissue barriers, such as the basement membrane by the migrating cancerous cells [250,251]. As discussed above, cell migration and invasion are distinct but coordinately regulated phenomena [239]. During the tumor progression, invasive capacity is required at multiple steps. Tumor cells frequently invade the surrounding tissue when the tumor starts to grow. Next, the capillary endothelial cells must invade the tumor and create the tumor blood vessels. Thereafter, some tumor cells intravasate into the blood circulation for metastasis, whereas the host immune cells invade the tumor. Finally, the tumor cells must arrest in the distant organs, extravasate and migrate into the new metastatic site and start the invasive cycle again [250]. Typically, alternating cycles of proteolysis and its inhibition occur in the tissues in order to control the protease activity (Fig. 4). It was originally thought that the protease activity is only required for the degradation of the underlying matrix. It has now become evident that proteases also generate promigratory signals by cleavage of latent growth factors or by disrupting cell­ cell contacts mediated by E-cadherin. The gelatinases actively participate in the activation of latent growth factors, MMP-9 being able to release active VEGF and TGF-h, thus promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth [33,252]. The proteases can also release protein fragments and growth factors with chemotactic activity from the ECM, and expose migration promoting cryptic epitopes [248,253]. Although proteases clearly stimulate cell migration in several occasions, current evidence suggests that protease activity per se is not always essential. It has become clear that protease-independent migration strategies exist. Recently, it was shown that catalytically inactive MT1-MMP mutant supported cell migration similarly to the wild type enzyme and the cell migration supporting activity was accounted for the catalytic domain and the C-terminal domain [254]. Other

investigators have similarly suggested a migration inducing ability of MMP-9 independent of the catalytic activity [208]. Despite complete pharmacological inhibition of protease activity, many cells continue to migrate by utilizing existing pathways in the matrix and migrating by an ameboid-like movement. For example, T cells, HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells can migrate in this manner [251]. Whether protease-interactions that are independent of the proteolytic activity are required in this kind of migration is not known. The protease-independent mode of cell migration may explain the observations that MMP-9 is required for neutrophil transmigration through the endothelium in some but not all in vivo models [86,255,256]. The gelatinases are also linked to the cell spreading and cytoskeletal changes during cell migration. Activated RhoA, the regulator of focal adhesions is necessary, but not sufficient for invasion [257]. MMP-9 colocalizes with RhoA, which is a regulator of cell spreading in endothelial cells and expression of a constitutively active RhoA increases MMP-9 secretion [258]. However, these results are contradictory to the results with RNA interference of MMP-9, which show that RhoA is inactive in the presence of MMP-9 and inhibition of MMP-9 expression decreases cell spreading [208]. It has been shown that inhibition of Rho by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant inhibits invasion but as well overexpression of Rho can reduce invasiveness [259]. These contradictory results may be explained by the finding that fluctuating levels of active Rho, rather than constitutively active Rho, are required for efficient invasion [260]. Other evidence for the involvement of gelatinases in cell spreading comes from the studies with MMP inhibitors. MMP-2 inhibition by overexpression of TIMP-2 causes extensive spreading of cells [261]. Many proteases, including the gelatinases accumulate into focal adhesions. For example, the gelatinases are found in the focal adhesions of endothelial cells [4], and both TIMPs and chemical MMP-inhibitors stabilize the focal adhesion contacts of fibroblasts [262]. Conversely, overexpression of MMPs may destabilize focal adhesions [240]. It has been suggested that MMP inhibitors augment cell adhesion by preventing cadherin cleavage and stabilize cell ­ cell contacts by inhibiting ECM degradation and thereby maintain integrin ­ECM adhesion and focal contact assembly [262].

be released from the cells in such a high concentration that the extracellular inhibitor concentration is locally exceeded. Consequently, a portion of the proteases remains uninhibited and is capable of focalized pericellular proteolysis for a short duration. This phenomenon has been called ``quantum proteolysis'' [264]. As mentioned earlier, stimulation of tumor cells with phorbol esters or growth factors induces proMMP-9 secretion. A small part of the secreted proMMP-9 is consequently observed on the cell surface of endothelial cells [4,265], keratinocytes [266], breast epithelial [265,267] and breast cancer cells [268], neutrophils [269,270], and many types of cancer cells including pancreatic [271], ovarian [272] and prostate cancer [273], mammary carcinoma [252,274], promyelotic leukemia [275] and fibrosarcoma cells [119]. The cell surface-bound gelatinases play a role in cell migration. For example, human bronchial epithelial cells secrete MMP-9 in an actin-dependent manner to the leading edge of migrating cells. MMP-9 activity in these cells was required specifically for cell migration and not adhesion or spreading [30]. Although the mechanisms by which the MMP-9 is localized on the cell surface appear to be redundant, there are a few important similarities. First, it appears that the cell-surface bound MMP-9 is often free of TIMP-1. This has been observed in breast epithelial cells as well as in neutrophils [267,270]. Second, in most studies, cell surface localized MMP-9 is found in the proenzyme form [119,265,267,269,271]. The inhibitor-free proenzyme is thought to be highly susceptible for activation. Multiple binding mechanisms of MMP-2 and -9 on the cell surface have been identified (Fig. 5) On the surface of MCF10A breast epithelial cells, HT1080 fibrosarcoma and other tumor cells, proMMP-9 can associate with the a2(IV) chain of collagen type IV, whereas the affinity of MMP-2 to this collagen chain is much lower [265,276]. This interaction is likely mediated through the collagen-binding domain as TIMP-1 does not inhibit this interaction [265]. The CBD of MMP-2 is also utilized for binding to the cell surface of normal fibroblasts. In a coculture system,

5. Cell surface associations of the gelatinases Controlling of the proteolytic activity at the cell surface greatly facilitates cell migration and invasion [263]. Docking of the proteases on the cell surface provides a direct mechanism by which cells can utilize and direct the proteolytic activity into correct substrates. The cell surface binding may additionally protect the proteases from the action of soluble inhibitors by steric hindrance, although some inhibitors like TIMP-2 have relatively free access to the cell surface. It has been also shown that proteases may

fibronectin present on the surface of cancer cells competes with the fibroblast-associated MMP-2 liberating soluble MMP-2 [277]. On the fibroblast surface, MMP-2 binds to collagens, likely the a1 and a2 chains of type I collagen, with a possible involvement of h1 integrins binding to these collagen chains [278]. Again, the CBD-mediated cell surface association of MMP-2 appears to be TIMPindependent, as the activation of MMP-2 on fibroblasts is markedly elevated by competing the cell surface bound MMP-2 with recombinant CBD [278]. A specific splicing variant of the hyaluronan receptor CD44 is involved in cell-surface association of MMP-9 in mouse mammary carcinoma and human melanoma cells. Disruption of this binding by overexpression of a soluble CD44 inhibits tumor invasion in vivo [274]. MT1-MMP may regulate this interaction as it proteolytically processes CD44. Curiously, this cleavage results in enhanced cell migration [279]. The interactions of CD44 with MMP-9 are complex, as it has been observed that in osteoclast-like cells hyaluronan binding to CD44 downregulates MMP-9 expression [280]. The interaction mechanism of CD44 with MMP-9 is not known, however, MT1-MMP utilizes the hemopexin-like domain for its interaction with CD44 [281]. MMP-9 interacts with CD44 in invadopodia [282]. These are the same cellular structures, which also contain MMP-2 and aVh3 [107] together with MT1-MMP [283]. In leukemic cells, proMMP-9 has been observed to interact with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which was identified as a substrate for MMP-9 [275]. Shedding of ICAM-1 by MMP-9 was found to enhance tumor cell resistance to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity indicating an additional mechanism, whereby MMP-9 may affect tumor growth [275]. Another cell surface receptor for the gelatinases is the low-density lipoprotein-related scavenger receptor (LRP). As mentioned before, MMP-2 and -9 can be internalized through this receptor [141,142]. Although in most cases, the gelatinases promote cell migration and invasion, other activities of the gelatinases may counteract this effect. For example, MMP-9 has been found to inhibit corneal reepithelialization by controlling cell replication [31]. Thus, it is not clear how the endocytic removal of gelatinases affects cell migration and invasion. The RECK protein is another cell-surface receptor for MMP-9 and MMP-2 although direct experimental evidence demonstrating the interactions of gelatinases with RECK is still lacking. Because RECK inhibits MMP activity, it probably preferentially binds the active gelatinases. Other receptors for gelatinases may also exist. MT2-MMP mediated activation of MMP-2 involves TIMP-independent C-terminal domain interactions on the cell surface, but the receptor has not been identified [284]. Two rather unexpected proteins have recently been identified as gelatinase interacting proteins on the cell surface. A functional proteomic screen identified that MMP2 interacts with heat shock protein 90 a isoform on the fibrosarcoma cell surface [285]. It was also found through

yeast two-hybrid screening that MMP-9 interacts with the DNA repair protein Ku. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal domain of MMP-9 and the integrin I domain-like domain of Ku and was observed on the surface of leukemic cells [286]. Integrins not only recognize various structural proteins, but they also act as receptors for proteases, including the MMPs. It has been reported that the aVh3 integrin recognizes the C-terminal domain of MMP-2 and is able to localize MMP-2 on the cell surface. More specifically, MMP-2 localizes with MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 and aVh3 integrin in specific membrane microdomains called caveolae as well as in invadopodia and in the leading edge of the migrating cells [287,288]. In some models, the cell surface activity of MMP-2 was found to be dependent on the aVh3 integrin interaction and this interaction was necessary for tumor angiogenesis [106,289]. Delivery of the MMP-2 Cterminal domain as a recombinant protein or via viral infection also potently suppressed angiogenesis [290]. The C-terminal domain of MMP-2 appears to be a naturally occurring proteolytic fragment and an inhibitor of pericellular MMP-2 activity [34,289]. A small molecule inhibitor named TSRI265 has been identified as a compound being able to block the interaction of MMP-2 and aVh3 integrin, but it did not inhibit MMP-2 activity. A labeled derivative of TSRI265 bound to the aVh3 integrin and not to MMP-2. Similarly to the C-terminal domain of MMP-2, TSRI265 inhibited angiogenesis indicating that MMP-2 must be localized on the cell surface to perform at least some of its biological functions [291,292]. Interestingly, the binding of MMP-2 C-terminal domain to the aVh3 integrin is RGD-independent and does not compete with vitronectin binding to the aVh3. Neither does the TSRI265 affect vitronectin binding [289,291]. RGDindependent binding to aVh3 integrin is not unique for MMP-2 as the binding of tumstatin, a proteolytic fragment of type IV collagen a3 chain is RGD-independent [293]. Unfortunately, the binding sites of MMP-2 and tumstatin in the integrin have not been elucidated. The presence of two or more binding sites in the aVh3 integrin suggests that integrins are able to gather many proteins to a single complex. This is apparently a necessary trait for efficient cell migration. MMP-9 has been observed to associate with a5h1 integrin in epithelial cells grown on fibronectin. The association could be modulated with gangliosides, suggesting that MMP-9 localizes to specific cell surface lipid microdomains [294,295]. Activated aVh3 functionally cooperates with MMP-9, because MMP-9 stimulates aVh3dependent migration of breast cancer cells [296]. Similarly, co-operation of a3h1 integrin and MMP-9 in tumor invasion has been observed [297]. MMP-9 also cooperates with aVh5 integrin. Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mediated induction of cell migration coincides with MMP9 expression and activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The migration was specifically inhibited by a broad

51

spectrum MMP inhibitor [268]. However, MMP-9 is not absolutely required for the IGF-1 mediated migration, as CS-1 melanoma cells transfected with aVh5 integrin also migrate in response to the IGF-1 stimulation [298] despite not expressing MMP-9 and only minimally MMP-2 [289]. Of considerable interest is the finding that there are two angiogenic pathways, which are differentially regulated by the aVh3 and aVh5 integrins [299]. Angiogenesis induced by bFGF and TNF-a is mediated through aVh3 integrins, whereas VEGF, TGF-a and phorbol ester acting through protein kinase C act through aVh5 integrins. Given that MMP-2 interaction with aVh3 integrins is critical for the angiogenic response, it is possible that MMP-9 could be similarly involved in the aVh5 integrin mediated angiogenic response as MMP-9 expression is induced by protein kinase C activation. We have recently found by using phage display of random peptides that MMP-9 interacts with aMh2 and aLh2 integrins on leukocytes and aVh5 integrin on HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells [67,86,300]. Peptides inhibiting these interactions effectively suppressed leukemia and fibrosarcoma cell migration in vitro, as well as thioglycollateinduced neutrophil migration and tumor growth in vivo [67,86,300]. There are likely additional interactions of the gelatinases (or more broadly MMPs), with integrins. A cytoplasmic sequence uniquely present in h6 integrin was recently found to be a regulator of MMP-9-dependent invasion. In addition, the same sequence grafted into h3 integrin promoted MMP-2-dependent invasion [301]. Although MMP-1, -2 and -9 bind to various integrins, the interaction mechanisms appear to differ slightly. The binding of MMP-2 and MMP-9 to aVh3 and aVh5 integrins, respectively, appears to be the most similar. Both MMPs bind through their C-terminal domain to the integrin outside the integrin ligand-binding site [67,289]. However, the small-molecule inhibitor inhibiting the MMP-2/aVh3 interaction binds to the integrin [291,292], whereas the CRVYGPYLLC peptide binds to the C-terminal domain of MMP-9 [67] indicating that the exact binding mechanism need not to be the very same. Based on sequence similarity, we mapped the binding site of the MMP-9 C-terminal domain to the integrin EGF-like modules 2+3 [302,303] present in the stalk of the integrin h chain. This region of the integrin is exposed only in activated integrins [302,303], indicating a novel mechanism to regulate MMP binding and revealing a completely new ligand binding site in integrins. The interactions of MMP-1 with a2h1 and MMP-9 with aMh2 integrins appear to be more conventional as the typical integrin ligand binding sites, the a I domains, are involved. However, there is a fundamental difference between MMP-1 and MMP-9 recognition. MMP-1 utilizes the C-terminal domain and the adjacent hinge region for a2 I domain binding [304], whereas MMP-9 catalytic domain interacts with the aM and aL I domains [300]. Whether this is a functional adaptation to achieve cell-type specific regulation of MMP activity remains to be determined.

6. Interactions of gelatinases with the urokinase-plasminogen activator system A number of proteases can activate gelatinases in vitro and in vivo suggesting that there is a significant crosstalk between different protease systems. How these interactions regulate cell migration and invasion is still largely unknown. The interactions of urokinase-plasminogen activator and its receptor with the gelatinases are highly illustrative examples. Similarly to MMPs, uPA and uPAR associate with integrins and directly influence the migration of various cells [95,305 ­308]. Expression levels of uPAR in vivo correlate with the invasiveness and the rate of the tumor growth. uPAR-deficient cells cease to grow and enter a state of dormancy in vivo [309] and this effect is mediated by the a5h1 integrin and MAPK signaling [95]. uPA and its receptor uPAR are also able to regulate the activation-state of the integrins. Some studies show that integrin activation by antibodies or divalent cations blocks uPA and MMP-2 activation and that MMP-2 activates uPA [105,310]. This suggests that uPA and MMPs are activated prior to integrin activation and remain associated to the integrins. A proteolytically cleaved uPAR form is found in invasive tumor xenografts [311] and in patients with acute myeloid leukemia [312]. The cleavage occurs between domains 1 and 2 impairs uPA and integrin binding [245] and exposes a chemotactic epitope [313] suggesting that this cleavage is one of the cell migration regulating events on the cell surface. This cleavage can be performed by uPA [314] or MMPs in vitro [67,246,315]. We additionally found that uPAR was cleaved in a gelatinase-dependent manner in both leukocytes and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, which are highly susceptible for migration inhibition by gelatinase inhibitors [67]. In vivo evidence that uPA and gelatinases are interdependent in tumor invasion comes from the chicken chorionallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. There, uPA and MMP-9 were identified as critical players in the intravasation process. Expression of both uPA and MMP-9 was required for intravasation [316].

7. Gelatinases in tumor progression Enhanced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 has been observed in cancers of breast, colon, lung, skin, ovary and prostate among others [1]. Increased gelatinase expression in these cancers is often accompanied with increased invasiveness and metastasis as well as decreased overall survival. Interestingly, MMP expression may be dependent on the stage of the cancer. In melanoma, increased expression of MMP-9 is found in the early steps, but at a later stage, the opposite is true [317]. In breast and colon cancer, MMP-9 expression has been correlated with both increased and decreased survival and formation of distant metastasis [318 ­ 321]. The current view is that the gelatinases and other MMPs are needed at multiple stages during the tumor progression

52

and different tumors may utilize different MMPs. The steps where MMPs are involved include the growth of the primary tumor, angiogenesis, intravasation of the tumor cells, migration and invasion of the metastatic cells in the secondary organ as well as initiation and support of the tumor growth in the metastatic site. Furthermore, MMPs may either promote or suppress tumor progression by cleaving various bioactive substrates. Thus, the final effect of gelatinases on tumor progression is highly context-dependent. 7.1. Angiogenesis Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels is a crucial process during the development. Angiogenesis was also realized to be a necessary step for tumor progression as tumors ceased to grow beyond a certain size without the nutrient and oxygen supply from the new blood vessels [322,323]. This conception has yielded a myriad of strategies to inhibit tumor growth by angiogenesis modulators. These include protease inhibitors, inhibitors of growth factors and growth factor receptors, integrin inhibitors, inhibitors of signaling cascades and many other agents with undefined mechanisms [324]. MMPs and especially the gelatinases are critically involved in angiogenesis in vitro [325,326] and in vivo [21,25]. The exact mechanisms how the gelatinases contribute to angiogenesis still remain obscure and may include multiple pathways. For example, TGF-h or phorbol ester-induced MMP-9 expression and proteolytic potential did not directly correlate with endothelial cell motility and in vitro angiogenesis [327]. The most direct evidence for gelatinases in angiogenesis comes from the studies of the initial steps in tumor angiogenesis. In a model of carcinogenesis of pancreatic islets in RIP1-Tag2 transgenic mice, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were found to be upregulated in angiogenic lesions. The upregulation of the gelatinases resulted in the release of bioactive VEGF, which is a major promoter of angiogenesis. Using MMP-2 and MMP-9 knockout mice, the switching from the quiescent to the angiogenic stage was found to be due to MMP-9 activity. MMP-2 deficiency did not impair the angiogenic switch but reduced the rate of tumor growth [33]. In the tumor tissue, the main source of MMP-9 appeared to be the tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells [33,194,328]. However, the angiogenic switching is not solely due to MMP-9 activity as cysteine cathepsin inhibitors also inhibit this process [329]. In a retinal neo-vascularization model, MMP-9 activity was required to expose a cryptic pro-migratory control site in collagen [330]. A monoclonal antibody HUIV26 recognizes an epitope in denaturated collagen type IV. Exposure of this epitope is required for angiogenesis in vivo and is associated with aVh3 binding to collagen type IV. In contrast to retina, in melanoma vasculature, the appearance of HUIV26 epitope is concomitant with the appearance of active MMP-2 [331]. MMPs are also involved in developmental angiogenesis as MMP-9- and MT1-MMP-

deficient mice show skeletal abnormalities due to a delayed vascular invasion of the cartilage [21,22,332]. 7.2. Metastasis Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to the new metastatic sites via blood or lymph vessels [333]. Metastasis is a highly inefficient but a deadly process [334]. It was long thought that some tumor cells acquire new mutations not initially present in the primary tumor cells making them metastatic. Later on, it was suggested that metastatic cells have an intrinsic signature pattern, the ``poor-prognosis signature'' that accounts for their metastatic behavior. A recent study has merged these metastasis theories by showing that in addition to a poor-prognosis signature, the metastatic cells must activate additional genes, which are not activated in the primary tumor [335]. Although no single gene has been identified as a major regulator of metastasis in all tumors, many animal models indicate a critical role for the MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9. For example, gene expression analysis of human tumors has linked MMP-9 with a poor prognosis in breast cancer [336]. In an experimental metastasis assay, intravenously injected melanoma or lung carcinoma cells showed significantly decreased number of metastatic colonies in MMP-9-deficient mice [337]. These results highlight the importance of host-derived MMPs in the metastatic process. Indeed, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are often derived from the stromal cells such as fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, immune cells and endothelial cells surrounding the tumor cells, and this appears to be a common theme for most MMPs [338,339]. Other experiments have shown contribution of MMP-9 in the lung metastasis induced by VEGF receptor-1. In these experiments, MMP-9 was upregulated in premetastatic lung endothelial cells as well as macrophages and MMP-9 deficiency led to a marked reduction in metastasis [340]. Intravasation, the invasion of the tumor cells to the blood circulation, is a critical step in the metastatic process. Using the CAM assay, uPA and MMP-9, have been identified as critical players in the intravasation process [316]. Intravasation was dependent on both urokinase and MMP-9, as in the absence of uPA or MMP-9, tumor cells showed only low levels of intravasation. These proteases may act in concert with the integrins as aVh5 is also required for tumor cell dissemination in the CAM model [298]. Furthermore, aVh5, but not aVh3, mediated migration and metastasis requires growth factor-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling, such as the action of insulin-like growth factor [341,342], which also upregulates uPA and MMP-9 [268,343]. The proteins implicated in the metastatic process form an interesting functional loop. First, receptor-bound uPA is essential for aVh5-mediated cell migration [344]. On the other hand, SPARC protein is required for aVh5-dependent metastasis to bone [345]. SPARC also induces MMP-1, -3 and -9 expression [346], and the MMPs may be activated by

M. Bjorklund, E. Koivunen / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1755 (2005) 37 ­ 69 ¨

53

uPA-mediated processes [117,119]. Furthermore, SPARC can be proteolytically processed by MMPs [347], and the MMP-cleaved SPARC fragments modulate cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis [348]. In contrast, extravasation, the entrance of tumor cells from the circulation to the tissues, is not critically dependent on the MMP activity. TIMP-1 overexpressing melanoma cells do not have any defect in the extravasation ability, but do show a decreased number and size of metastases after extravasation indicating a critical role for MMPs in the subsequent tumor growth [349]. Similar results have also been obtained using tumor cell lines with low and high metastatic potential in mice and in the CAM assay. No difference in the extravasation rate was observed, whereas subsequent migration in the tissue and the rate of tumor cell proliferation were different [350,351]. Thus, whereas the spreading of the tumor cells into various organs from the primary tumor appears to be an efficient process, the subsequent growth of these metastasized cells is a ratelimiting step. Quantitative measurements on the individual steps in metastasis have confirmed that the ability of intravasation and the ability for growth expansion in the secondary organs are indeed the rate-limiting steps [352]. The mechanisms controlling the growth of the cancer cells in the secondary organs are not known in a detail. It is unlikely that the cells would continuously proliferate in the metastatic site as it can take years before tumors can be detected in secondary organs. It thus seems that the cells either enter a state of dormancy or there is a balance of continuous proliferation and apoptosis in the micrometastasis. Both models are supported by experimental evidence. The tumor dormancy might be due to specific downregulation of cell surface molecules such as uPAR [95] and angiogenic signals may then be used to terminate the dormant state [353]. MMPs apparently also participate at this step as TIMP-1 expression by the tumor cells, but not by the surrounding tissue, significantly affects the initiation and growth of the tumors [354]. There are also evidence supporting the continuos proliferation/apoptosis model of metastases [355]. 7.3. Cancer-associated inflammation It has been estimated that over 15% of the malignancies have an infectious origin [356]. In addition to these, the leukocytes participate in the tumor progression also in the absence of infectious agents. Chronic inflammation associated with some cancers can further stimulate cancer progression due to the release of MMPs from the inflammatory cells [125,328]. The critical role of MMP-9, apparently derived from leukocytes, in the initiation of angiogenesis was discussed above. Tumor cells produce an array of cytokines and chemokines that induce leukocyte infiltration to the tumor. The same cytokines and chemokines may also promote tumor growth by an autocrine mechanism. The tumor-infiltrated leukocytes, including

neutrophils, dendritic cells, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells and lymphocytes can extensively modify tumor microenvironment by producing additional cytokines, reactive oxygen species, proteases including MMPs, interferons and other compounds [357]. However, inflammation in cancer is a two-bladed sword as the compounds released by the inflammatory cells may either suppress or enhance tumor progression. Thus, it appears that a delicate balance of pro- and anti-tumor activity defines the fate of the tumors; both excessive and inadequate exploitation of the inflammatory components produced by leukocytes and the other stromal cells is detrimental to the tumor growth [357]. Chemokines are important mediators of leukocyte recruitment into the tumors. In addition to their role in the regulation of directional migration of leukocytes, chemokines are also able to directly modify endothelial and tumor cell chemotaxis and thus affect migratory and invasive behavior of the tumor. Some chemokines may inhibit directly or indirectly angiogenesis, whereas others are proangiogenic. Furthermore, chemokines may be proteolytically processed to regulate their activity. For example, platelet factor (PF)-4, monokine induced by interferon IFN-g (MIG), interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10/ CXCL-10) and stromal-cell derived factor (SDF)-1 are angiostatic chemokines [358], which can be cleaved by the gelatinases thus potentially enhancing angiogenesis. Similarly, the gelatinases can process angiogenic chemokines including granulocyte chemotactic protein (GCP)-2, epithelial-cell derived neutrophil activating peptide (ENA)-78, growth-regulated oncogene (GRO)-a and pro-interleukin-8 [358] (see Table 1). Some chemokines also participate in the homing of tumor cells into the metastatic sites [359,360]. Hence, the gelatinases may affect metastasis also by regulating chemokine activity. The gelatinases, especially MMP-9, have been implicated in the negative regulation of immune response to cancer by cleaving the interleukin-2a receptor, activation of TGF-h and by shedding of ICAM-1 [252,275,361]. MMP-2 is able to proteolytically process monocyte chemoattractant proteins and suppress inflammation in vivo [362]. As the action of inflammatory cells is intimately involved in tumor progression, the use of anti-inflammatory agents, such as the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, is an attractive approach for anti-cancer therapy [178,363]. Another possibility could be the prevention of leukocyte migration into the tumors. The selective expression of h2 integrins in leukocytes might provide a suitable therapeutic window, although leukocytes may also utilize other integrins for migration [364].

8. Dual role of gelatinases in cancer Although inhibition of gelatinases in many cases results in regression of tumor growth, the gelatinases, especially MMP-

54

M. Bjorklund, E. Koivunen / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1755 (2005) 37 ­ 69 ¨

9 can also stimulate tumor growth. Based on the data obtained with MMP and TIMP knockout animals, as well as with various in vitro models and clinical trials, it has become evident that gelatinases and other MMPs have both pro- and anti-angiogenic properties. Furthermore, it has become evident that there are tissue- and tumor-specific differences in the use of MMPs and TIMPs [1]. The dual role of MMPs in cancer is somewhat similar to the role of aV integrins. The aV integrin antagonists effectively suppress tumor angiogenesis in in vitro and in animal models [299,365,366]. However, the knockout mice of aVh3 and aVh5 alone or in combination show increased angiogenesis and tumor growth [367,368]. Although genetic ablation of all aV integins is detrimental in mice, some of the pups were born alive and extensive vasculogenesis was observed implicating that these integrins are not the sole regulators of blood vessel formation [369]. One of the anti-angiogenic activities of the MMPs is the generation of angiostatin, a proteolytic fragment of plasminogen. As it name implies, it is a negative regulator of angiogenesis. Of the MMPs, MMP-2, -7, -9 and -12 can generate angiostatin. This may be a crucial factor in controlling the growth rate of certain tumors. Tumors grown in integrin a1 knockout mice were significantly smaller than those grown in wild type mice, these tumors also showed remarkably reduced angiogenesis and increased plasma angiostatin. In further experiments, elevated levels of MMP-7 and MMP-9 were found to be responsible for angiostatin generation [370] and low plasma levels of MMP-9 were associated with increased angiogenesis [371]. A similar effect would probably be observed by MMP-9generated endostatin [166]. A third anti-angiogenic protein generated by MMP-9 is tumstatin, a fragment from the noncollagenous domain of collagen type IV a3 chain. Interestingly, physiological concentrations of tumstatin effectively suppress tumor growth. MMP-9-deficient mice showed an accelerated rate of tumor growth after an initial lag period. This increased tumor growth was linked to the absence of tumstatin [372]. Tumstatin knockout mice similarly showed increased tumor growth associated with enhanced tumor angiogenesis. Interestingly, angiogenesis associated with the normal development and tissue repair was normal [372]. We suggest that protein fragments such as angiostatin, endostatin and tumstatin normally function to terminate angiogenesis when tissue repair has been accomplished. In diseases like cancer, enhanced production of protein fragments illustrates the high proteolytic activity of a tumor site. As discussed above, proteolytic processing of chemokines may be an additional level where the gelatinases may either suppress or enhance tumor progression. It is currently unclear to what extent this activity of gelatinases affects tumor growth. Other MMPs, however, have been implicated to play a role in the regulation of tumor-associated inflammation. MMP-8-deficient mice show an increased incidence of skin tumors in a chemical carcinogenesis model [373]. These mice also developed the tumors more rapidly than the wild-type mice and the observed effect could be

tracked to a sustained inflammatory response in the tumor [373].

9. Therapeutic possibilities with the MMP inhibitors Despite the beneficial effects of MMP inhibitors in the in vitro assays and in animal models, most clinical trials so far have been disappointing. The reasons for these failures have been widely analyzed [195,209,374,375]. The main reason for the failures of MMP-inhibitors is that most clinical studies involved advanced stage cancers. It has now been established that the MMP-inhibitors such as marimastat are not particularly effective at the later stages as also shown with the mouse models [376]. Another reason for the failures is that no reliable biomarkers have been available for the evaluation of the efficacy of MMP inhibitors. Thus, it has been utmost difficult or impossible to show that the inhibitors would have sufficiently inhibited their targets [374]. For example, analysis of the serum or plasma levels of MMPs has been largely uninformative [195], but the recently developed MMP-activity imaging agents may alleviate this problem [377]. A further difficulty in the evaluation of MMP-inhibitor activity in the clinical trials is that the MMP inhibitors are not cytotoxic. Thus, they do not directly cause shrinkage of the established tumors. This requires setting of new endpoints in the evaluation of drug efficacy. Moreover, the first clinical studies were initiated when little was known about the roles of various MMPs in cancer and broad-spectrum inhibitors of MMPs were used. Whether the more selective inhibitors will show any more benefit in the clinical trials is still a major question, as even a single MMP can have both pro- and anti-tumor activities. In accordance with this, the observations that some MMPdeficient mice show increased tumor growth, is a major concern [328,372,373]. Thus, alternative and/or more selective MMP-inhibition strategies are likely to be required, but even their success cannot be guaranteed. Despite the poor success of most MMP inhibitor trials, important data have been accumulating to support the development of MMP inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Phase I studies, which aim to evaluate the safety of the tested drugcandidates, have established that the MMP inhibitors are in general safe and well tolerated. The main adverse effect of MMP-inhibitors has been musculoskeletal pain [378]. The effect is probably due to inhibition of ADAMs, as those MMP inhibitors with a reduced activity to the ADAMs do not show these side-effects [379]. Hence, no major side-effects are expected to occur with the newer generation, highly selective MMP inhibitors. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that not all trials with the broad-spectrum inhibitors have been failures. For example, marimastat has shown modest increase in overall survival of patients with gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer [375,380]. MMP inhibitors are probably best viewed as antiangiogenic agents for primary tumors and as agents to

prevent metastasis. Before attempting cancer therapy with the MMP inhibitors, it would be beneficial to measure MMPs, or preferably MMP activity in tumors and blood as a means of identifying those who are likely to respond to the therapy [188]. In addition, a combination of MMP-inhibitor with a cytotoxic drug could be a more attractive therapeutic alternative. Some reports have indicated a synergistic effect of gelatinase selective inhibitors with apoptosis inducing agents in cell culture [381]. Animal models with a combination therapy have been promising, with reduced metastasis and increased survival [382 ­ 384]. As a consequence, several clinical studies with combination therapy are now in progress [339,385], but the first failures with the combination therapy have been already reported [386]. Several strategies have been suggested for the future MMP inhibitor trial development [375]. These include inhibitors that can be administered for long periods of time without sideeffects, combination of MMP inhibitors with other proteinase inhibitors, inhibition of MMP synthesis, design of more selective inhibitors and treating cancer at earlier stages. Alternatively, inhibition of localized MMP activity may be a potential antitumor approach as demonstrated by the inhibition of MMP-2 binding to the aVh3 integrin [291] or CRVYGPYLLC peptide-mediated inhibition of MMP-9 interaction with aVh5 integrin [67]. This peptide binds to the C-terminal domain of MMP-9 without affecting the gelatinase enzyme activity. The CRVYGPYLLC peptide also inhibits plasminogen/MMP-3 mediated activation of MMP-9 in cell culture and shows antitumor activity in a mouse model [67]. Thus, reagents that prevent cell-surface association and activation of the gelatinases suppress angiogenesis and tumor invasion. Whether such compounds allow sufficient formation of anti-angiogenic products such as angiostatin, endostatin and tumstatin remains to be elucidated. Overexpression of MMPs in cancer provides also alternative therapeutic approaches, independent on MMP inhibition. Targeting of drugs encapsulated into liposomes coated with MMP-

targeting compounds is one possibility [198]. Another novel use of MMPs is to use prodrugs that become cytotoxic upon proteolytic cleavage by an MMP [387,388] or MMPactivatable gene therapy vectors [389]. As it is now evident that MMPs promote cancer progression mainly at the early stages, it is crucial to identify the primary tumors as early as possible. The MMP inhibitors coupled to imaging agents could be used to detect small tumors due to their tumortargeting properties [198,377,390].

10. Conclusions Pericellular protease activity clearly facilitates cell migration and invasion, although it may not be absolutely necessary. The gelatinases also function in the pericellular space and intimately interact with cell-surface adhesion molecules such as h2, h3 and h5 integrins and CD44 [67, 106,274,289,300], and also with cell-surface-associated collagen chains [265,278] and other cell surface receptors [285,286]. Fig. 6 shows phage display-derived peptides that have had a cell migration inhibiting activity in vitro or in vivo. A hypothetical model of gelatinase-mediated cell migration/ invasion machinery can be proposed based on these peptides and the current known interaction partners of the gelatinases (Fig. 6). We propose a name ``invadosome'' for this protein complex. In addition to the interactions characterized in our laboratory, inhibitors of interactions between uPA and uPAR as well as uPAR and integrins have been identified by phage display [305,391]. The invadosome is likely a short-lived complex where MMPs, integrins, uPA/uPAR, matrix proteins and possibly other proteins are brought together, when the cells encounter a non-degraded extracellular matrix and need to invade and migrate. Indeed, many integrin ligands are substrates for the integrin-associated proteinases. By definition, the cell migration machinery must be a highly

Fig. 6. The invadosome model. The molecular components of plasminogen/MMP-3 activation cascade, and integrin and MMP-9 domains are shown. The invadosome regulates multiple proteolytic and nonproteolytic functions, which are required for controlled cell migration and invasion for example during intravasation of the tumor cells into the blood stream. Phage display-derived peptides that bind either to integrin or MMP-9 domains are depicted. MMP-9 interacts with the integrin in two ways, the catalytic domain of proMMP-9 interacts with the integrin a I domain and the C-terminal domain of MMP-9 with the integrin h chain I-EGF domain.

dynamic complex to be able to perform the multiple tasks that are necessary for migration and invasion. The composition of the complex must also vary depending on the extracellular matrix ligands. Although all the components indicated in the invadosome complex may not bind at the same time, the differential binding sites identified suggest that they might do so. Another point to note is that the proteinases have functions independent on their proteolytic activity. This has been well established with the uPA/uPAR system [392] and evidence is accumulating that the MMPs function similarly [208,254]. Another issue is the relationship between the integrin activation-state and MMP binding. The a I domain containing integrins can exist in several conformations: (1) the inactive bent form with a closed headpiece containing the ligand binding regions; (2) extended form with closed headpiece and low affinity I domain; (3) extended form with open headpiece and low affinity I domain; (4) extended form with open headpiece and high affinity I domain [393]. The non-I domain integrins, such as aVh3 and aVh5 exist at least in the bent and the extended conformation [394,395]. Our studies suggest that the extended conformation of the integrin is required for the MMP C-terminal domain interaction [67]. Furthermore, does activation of MMPs occur simultaneously or subsequently to integrin activation? Some studies have indicated that the activation of the proteases may occur concomitantly with integrin ligand-binding and activation [105,310]. Investigations with activation state-specific integrin antibodies and antibodies specific for pro- and active MMPs could shed light on this matter. One of the major questions still is whether the MMPs are a clinically relevant target for the therapeutic intervention in cancer and to what extent other diseases could be treated with the MMP inhibitors. Although over hundred small-molecules targeting the catalytic site of the MMPs have been synthesized, these compounds have limited specificity to individual MMPs and no significant success has been seen with these compounds in the clinical trials. However, new promising selective gelatinase inhibitors have been reported [186,396]. Gelatinase function-blocking peptide inhibitors such as the CTT, DDGW, PPC and CRV peptides [67,197,300] could also be potential therapeutics. Although peptides are often overlooked as therapeutics, they still represent a potent alternative. For example, enfuvirtide, a 36-amino acid peptide, which blocks HIV-1 virus entry has worked utmost well in phase III trials with HIV patients [397]. At present, there is still not sufficient knowledge on the role of individual MMPs in cancer. Hence, the decision, which MMP should be targeted remains an educated guess. Even if such knowledge would be available, the conserved structural features of the MMPs indicate that it will be a considerable challenge to synthesize an active-site inhibitor with specificity to a single MMP. Additionally, the MMPs are typically required in the early stage of the tumor progression, thus, the best therapeutic window for the MMP

inhibitors may be lost if the disease is not early diagnosed. However, here the MMP targeting imaging agents could be highly useful to identify the MMP inhibitor responsive tumors early [198,377,390]. New treatment strategies include the synthesis of non-active site inhibitors that affect integrin and other cell-surface interactions of the MMPs and use the MMP inhibitors in combination with drugs affecting other functions of the cancer cells. It remains to be seen, whether the more selective active-site inhibitors, exosite inhibitors and inhibitors of protein ­ protein interactions are any more successful as cancer therapeutics. Certainly, a better knowledge on the role of MMPs in cancer progression is required to achieve this goal. For example, knowledge about the binding partners for the gelatinases alone is still incomplete. The recent findings that the gelatinases interact with the chaperone protein Hsp90 and DNA repair protein Ku [285,286] and that these interactions regulate cell invasion is one indication that we do not yet understand all the fine details about tumor cell migration and invasion.
