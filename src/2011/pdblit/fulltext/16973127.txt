Abstract--Acute ethanol exposure of rat isolated hepatocytes leads to a significant decrease ( 30%) in cytosolic enzymatic activity of classic protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, while immunoreactive protein level measured by Western Blot remains unaffected. The inactivation of classic cytosolic isoforms appears dependent on the modification of the enzyme function, probably due to ethanol metabolism. In fact, pretreatment with 4-methylpyrazole (4MP), an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, fully prevented such damage. After ethanol treatment, a decrease of about 40% in both enzymatic activity and immunoreactive protein level of novel PKC isoforms was evident both in the soluble and particulate fractions. Even if 4MP cell pre-treatment afforded protection in this case too, the inhibitory action of ethanol on novel PKC hepatocyte isoforms involves a proteolytic mechanism as shown by Western Blot analysis. The reproduction of PKC inactivation by ethanol in hepatocyte lysate excluded a role of peroxisomal hydrogen peroxide in the pathogenesis of the damage investigated. This damage was not reduced by addition of catalase to the lysate model system.

INTRODUCTION

Protein kinase C (PKC) plays a key role in the cellular signaling system. Once activated, through a wide range of cellular messengers, PKC triggers short and long-term responses, involving gene expression, cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis.1­3 To date, 12 PKC isoforms have been identified and classified into three groups based on their structure and cofactor regulation.3 The best characterized and first discovered are the classic PKCs (cPKCs): ; two alternatively spliced variants I and II; and . Their enzymatic activity is regulated by calcium (Ca2 ) and phospholipids.1 The next best characterized are the novel PKCs (nPKCs): , , , , and . These isoforms are structurally similar to cPKCs, but their

activation is independent of cellular Ca2 concentration. The least studied group is represented by the atypical PKCs (aPKCs): , , and , whose structures and functions are various.4 Classic and novel PKC activity may be regulated by oxidative modification of a cysteine-rich regulatory domain, which is believed to be required for binding diacylglycerol (DAG) and tumour promoting phorbol esters;5 these oxidant tumour promoters either stimulate or inhibit classic and novel PKC activity, depending on the extent of the oxidative modification and on the resistance of the cell type to oxidative damage.6 ­ 8 Ethanol and related aliphatic alcohols at least up to hexanol, have recently been demonstrated to inhibit PKC activity.9,10 The only evidence of ethanol-induced activation of the kinase comes from studies on astrocytes chronically exposed to the alcohol.11 The present study evaluated the effects of acute ethanol metabolism on the enzymatic activity, translocation and immunoreactive protein level of c and nPKCs in rat hepatocytes to elu-

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemicals Ethanol was supplied by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). DEAE cellulose (DE52) was from Whatman Biochemicals Ltd. Sprigerfield Mill (Maidstone, Kent, UK); [32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) and hyperfilm ECL were supplied by Amersham International (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies reacting with , I, II, , , and PKCs and a single mouse monoclonal antibody reacting with all classic PKC isoforms ( , I, II) were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Protein A-sepharose and dithiothreitol (DTT) were supplied by Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). All other reagents were from Sigma Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Isolation and incubation of rat hepatocytes Male Wistar rats of 200 ­300 g were fed ad libitum with a standard semi-synthetic diet. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion as described by Poli et al.12 Some cellular suspensions (5 106 cells/ml) were pre-treated with 200 M 4-methylpyrazole (4MP) for 15 min. Two different experimental systems were employed: in the first, control and 4MP pre-treated hepatocytes were exposed to 20 M ethanol for 60 min.; in the second, lysed hepatocytes were placed in a standard stock solution, containing 0.15 M KCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and an appropriate NADPH-generating system: 0.1 M glucose 6-phosphate, 0.245 mM NADP and 8.4 IU of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, to maintain ethanol metabolism. Incubation was for 60 min at 37°C and ethanol was added to the cell-free system to achieve a final concentration of 20 mM. Some samples of the cell-free system were supplemented with 1 mM palmitoyl CoA and catalase at a concentration of 40 IU/mg protein. The reactions were terminated by adding 10% TCA and the samples were kept on ice for at least 30 min. Glutathione assay Reduced glutathione (GSH) determination in the hepatocytes was carried out as described by Fariss and Reed.13 An aliquot of cellular suspensions (3.5 106 cells/ml) was layered over a dibutyl phtalate oil layer,

which was layered over 10% perchloric acid with 1 mM bathophenanthroline disulphonic acid, and centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 g. One hundred millimolar iodoacetic acid in m-cresol purple was then added to a portion of the acid extract with 15 mM ( -glutamylglutamate). The solution was brought to pH 8.0 by the addition of 2 M KOH-2.4 M KHCO3. Finally, 1-fluoro2,4-dinitrobenzene (1% v/v in ethanol) was added and the solution stored in the dark at 4°C until it was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The 2,4-dinitrophenyl-derivatives were separated and measured using the HPLC system 322 (Kontron instruments) equipped with a Spherisorb NH2 column (30 0.4 cm) and UV detector (365 nm). Malondialdehyde determination Cell samples (5 106 cells) were treated with 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 and 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4methylphenol (BHT). Malondialdehyde (MDA) was assayed following Young and Trimble's HPLC method.14 The thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reaction was carried out by mixing 250 l of 1.22 M phosphoric acid, 450 l of HPLC grade water, 50 l of control or ethanol-exposed cell suspensions (5 106 cells/ml) and 250 l of 0.44 M TBA. The reaction mixture was incubated in a boiling water bath for 1 h in sealed glass tubes and then cooled to 4°C in ice. Ten minutes or less before injection onto the column, all samples were neutralized with 40 l of 1 M NaOH plus 360 l of HPLC grade methanol. The TBA-MDA adducts were measured by an isocratic HPLC method using fluorimetric detection (excitation 532 nm, emission 553 nm). The mobile phase contained 50% methanol and 50% 25 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 (flow rate 0.8 ml/min). Pure MDA obtained from 1,1,3,3-tetra-ethoxy-propane was adopted as standard. Separation and assay of c-PKC activity Hepatocytes were lysed by sonication in 2 ml of 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethyl piperazine-N-N-2 ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer pH 7.5, containing 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM ethylene dinitrilotetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mM leupeptin, and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was collected and the particulate fraction treated with the lysing buffer, containing 0.2% Triton X-100, for 20 min on ice. The protein kinase C activities of both cellular fractions were separated by chromatography on DEAE cellulose (DE 52) following Tapley and Murray's procedure.15 PKC activity was assayed using histone H1 as substrate, in the presence of optimal concentrations of Ca2 , phosphatidylserine and dioleylglycerol.15,16

Cytosol and membrane fractions isolated from rat hepatocytes were analysed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent immunoblot using PKC isoform-specific antibodies. Scanning densitometry of immunoreactive bands allowed comparative changes in the level of cPKC isoforms and nPKC and to be estimated. Opportunely diluted17 membrane fractions were immunoblotted. The immunoreactive bands were analysed by scanning densitometry to establish the real percentage of membrane-bound PKC isoforms. Each value is the mean ( SD) of four determinations. Fig. 1.

Results were confirmed by four separate experiments.

In vitro c- and n-PKC activity assay PKC isoforms were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and protein A sepharose, starting from 100 g of protein samples. The beads were washed three times in a PKC buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM DTT). The kinase assay was performed by adding 40 l of PKC buffer containing 0.1 mM ATP, [ 32P]ATP (2 Ci per sample), 1 g of phosphatidylserine, 0.4 g of dioleylglycerol, 0.5 mM CaCl2 and 10 g of histone H1 as substrate. The PKC buffer was modified for n PKC activity assay, in which calcium is omitted. The reaction was continued for 10 min at 37°C, then stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. After centrifugation, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted on nitrocellulose membrane, which was then exposed to an autoradiographic film for 24 h.

Statistical analysis Each experiment was performed at least in quadruplicate. Results are expressed as means SD for each set of conditions. Significance of parametric difference among groups was evaluated with one-way ANOVA and Dunnet's test for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS

Immunoreactive protein levels and distribution of PKC isoforms in rat hepatocytes The presence of PKC isoforms was established by Western Blot analysis in hepatocyte extracts. As shown in Fig. 1, immunostaining revealed the presence of , a single net band with some aspecific staining, I, as usual resolved in two bands, II, and : PKC was the most represented isoform, II and isoenzymes were only just detectable. Using specific antibodies, PKC isoenzyme was also identified in the hepatocyte extract; since the PKC antibody showed considerable non-specificity, it is possible that other cross-reacting proteins were also recognized, and we therefore did not consider this PKC isoenzyme in our experimental study. The pattern and distribution of the isoforms obtained were in agreement with other reports18 ­20 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Effects of ethanol on cellular malondialdehyde production and glutathione content To investigate the effects of acute ethanol exposure on cPKC activity, rat hepatocytes were incubated with 20 mM ethanol for 60 min.

Immunoblot analysis Cytosol and membrane fractions (from 20 to 80 g of total proteins, depending on the isoform tested and on its localization) were subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electroblotting onto a nitro-cellulose membrane. Samples of particulate fractions were prepared with increasing amounts (1, 2, 3, 4 ml) of lysing buffer to establish the real percentage of membrane-bound PKC, as indicated in Table 1.17 Immunodetection was performed using specific PKC isoenzyme antibodies. After incubation with the second antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase, immunoreactive signals of blots were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system.

The oxidative state of the cells was analysed by measuring the level of GSH. Ethanol treatment induced oxidation of approximately 50% of intracellular GSH; this oxidation was completely prevented by pre-incubation with 4MP, a well known inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (Fig. 2). Although it was clear that the oxidative state of hepatocytes was affected by ethanol treatment, lipid peroxidation, measured as production of MDA (0.13 nmol/106 cells), appeared only slightly modified ( 25% vs. control) and strictly related to the imbalance of the physiological antioxidative defense system due to GSH depletion21,22 (Fig. 3). Ethanol-induced decrease in classic PKC activity in the cytosol; protective effect of 4MP (p In these experimental conditions, a 30% decrease .001) in cPKC activity was observed in the cytosol

of 20 mM ethanol-treated hepatocytes, while in the particulate fraction the kinase activity was not modified by ethanol metabolism (Table 2). Rat hepatocytes were pre-treated with 4MP to demonstrate the involvement of ethanol metabolism in the observed PKC change. Pre-incubation of hepatocytes with 200 M 4MP did not affect cPKC activity in control cells, and restored the cytosolic cPKC activity inhibited by 20 mM ethanol (Table 2). In vitro kinase activity assay of single components of classic isoforms ( , I, and II) has revealed no differences among Ca2 dependent isozymes in the response to ethanol-induced effects; therefore, only the activity values obtained after immunoprecipitation with the antibody recognizing all cPKC isoforms have been reported and confirmed by data derived from activity assay after chromatographic separation of classic protein kinases. Cytosolic and particulate fractions from control and treated hepatocytes were analysed by Western Blot. As densitometric evaluation of immunoreactive bands showed, classic PKC isoenzymes ( , I, and II) in the cytosolic compartment and their translocation to the membrane were not modified by acute ethanol exposure (Fig. 4). Ethanol-induced decrease in both activity and expression level of novel PKCs; protection exerted by cell pre-treatment with 4MP Cytosolic and PKC of 20 mM ethanol-treated hepatocytes showed a significant decrease in activity, which is measured in the order of 40%. In the case of novel PKCs, a similar degree of inactivation was also detected in the particulate fraction (Table 2). Of note, novel PKC inactivation was paralleled by marked reduction (about 40%) of the immunoreactive protein level, as

Specific antibodies against , I, II, , and PKC were tested in the cytosol (30 g of total proteins) and membrane (45 g of total proteins) fractions from untreated (A), 200 M 4MP (B), 20 mM ethanol, (C) and 200 M 4MP 20 mM ethanol-treated (D) hepatocytes.

Results were confirmed by four separate experiments.

measured by Western Blot (Fig. 4). 4MP pre-treatment once again prevented both inactivation and decreased expression of these kinases (Table 2, Fig. 4). Protection by 4-methylpyrazole is not mediated by its inhibitory effect on fatty acyl CoA synthetase, resulting in decreased hydrogen peroxide and related reactive oxygen species (ROS) production In hepatocyte lysate, following 20 mM ethanol addition, the decrease in cPKC activities was confirmed, and was also prevented by 4MP pre-treatment (Fig. 5). Immunoreactive classic PKC levels were not modified by ethanol metabolism and similar behaviour was noted in the components, ( , I, and II) of this subfamily; therefore, also in this context, an antibody able to recognize all the classic isoforms was employed. Under the same conditions, and PKC activities showed a more marked reduction, accompanied by a significant decrease in the immunoreactive protein levels. 4MP almost completely prevented ethanol-induced changes in the activity and immunoreactive protein level of novel PKCs. In the experimental conditions applied in this study, addition of catalase (40 I.U./mg protein), which per se did not affect activity or protein content of the PKC isoforms tested (Fig. 5, lane E), did not prevent the PKC changes due to acute ethanol treatment at all (Fig. 5, lane F). Moreover, 1 mM palmitoyl CoA, which has been

shown to stimulate peroxisomal hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and ethanol metabolism,23 induced almost complete inactivation of all PKC isoenzymes, accompanied, as Western Blot analysis revealed, by a reduction of classic isoform immunoreactive protein level, and by the disappearance of novel isoforms; this despite the presence of 4MP in the incubation medium (Fig. 5, lane G).
DISCUSSION

The data reported here show that ethanol induces significant modifications in both classic and novel hepatocyte PKC isoforms through its metabolism. Previous studies carried out in our laboratories have demonstrated an overall significant inactivation of protein kinase C following acute exposure of rat hepatocytes to 20 mM ethanol.10 The prevention of ethanol damage by the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4MP points to acetaldehyde as the probable intermediate responsible for PKC inactivation. The kinase may be particularly sensitive to this metabolite because of the presence of thiol-rich regions in its molecular structure. Acetaldehyde has been demonstrated to covalently bind to proteins and GSH in consequence of the high affinity of acetaldehyde for sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues present in their molecular structures24 ­26; in agreement with this, a sig-

Fig. 5. Role of catalase and of alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated ethanol metabolism in the observed changes in PKC isoforms. Aliquots (100 g of proteins) of hepatocyte lysate in all experimental conditions were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. PKC assay was performed with (cPKCs) or without (nPKCs) calcium in the presence of phospholipids, and using isoform specific substrate. Western Blot analysis of the same samples was performed as described in Fig. 4. Lane A: untreated; lane B: 200 M 4MP; lane C: 20mM ethanol; lane D: 200 M 4MP 20mM ethanol; lane E: 40 i.u./mg catalase; lane F: 20 mM ethanol 40 i.u./mg catalase; lane G: 200 M 4MP 20 mM ethanol 1 mM palmitoyl CoA. Results were confirmed by four separate experiments.

nificant decrease in cellular GSH concentration has consistently been observed in 20 mM ethanol-treated cells. In our model of acute hepatocyte intoxication, the redox state of ethanol-treated cells was unbalanced but not seriously, as indirectly indicated by the fact that GSH decrease was associated with a modest ( 25%) increment of MDA production. On the contrary, it has frequently been reported that chronic ethanol administration leads to a condition of marked oxidative stress, with levels of MDA production 3- to 10-fold those of controls21,22,27; hence, at least in the experimental system used, acetaldehyde rather than aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation appears to be a major candidate responsible for PKC derangement. 4MP has recently been found to be an effective inhibitor of ethanol oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at peroxisomal level. Its effect is due to competitive inhibition of fatty-acylCoA-synthetase, with consequent decrease in H2O2 production because of reduced fatty acid oxidation by peroxisomes.23 Thus the 4MPinduced prevention of PKC loss and/or inactivation after acute ethanol poisoning might also be due to a decrease in H2O2 and other related reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during peroxisomal oxidative metabolism. The actual involvement of hydrogen peroxide and related ROS in PKC isoform modifications was investigated in lysed hepatocytes. The failure of catalase to protect against ethanol-induced PKC changes indicates that H2O2 does not play a relevant role in the observed damage. Further, supplementation of the 20 mM ethanoltreated hepatocyte lysate with 1 mM palmitoyl CoA, in order to stimulate peroxisomal oxidation of the alcohol,

induced an almost complete loss of c and nPKC protein and activity, by a mechanism that is not prevented or reduced by 4MP. These two lines of evidence are against the involvement of ROS in the mechanism by which acute ethanol exposure inactivates PKC. In conclusion, the reported data according to our previous results10 suggest that a single overdose of ethanol can interfere with the regulation of hepatocyte PKC through acetaldehyde-mediated modification of classic isoforms, and at least partial proteolytic degradation of novel isoforms. One possible explanation for the different effect of ethanol metabolites on classic and novel kinases is a differential regulation of the two subclasses; indeed there is evidence that the sensitivity to proteolytic degradation of cytosolic and membrane-associated novel PKCs ( and ) is greater than that of cPKCs28,29; ethanol metabolism and its related products could trigger and/or enhance such sensitivity. Impairment of this important transmembrane signal transduction mechanism is probably of relevance in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury. The PKC signaling pathway appears to be involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, in particular in the cellular export of protein and lipoprotein micelles from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus. In fact, protein kinase C modulates the association of ADP-ribosylation factor to Golgi membranes, a key molecular event in vesicular traffic.30 Moreover, an overall acceleration of exocytic transport can be induced by PKC stimulation31; hence, the observed inactivation of protein kinase C by acute ethanol poisoning could reasonably play a role in the

impairment of Golgi vesicle exportation, a major step in pathogenesis of fatty liver. To better understand the role of PKC changes in ethanol-induced derangement of hepatic protein and lipoprotein secretion, we now intend to analyse the modulation of both content and activity of classic and novel isoforms in rat liver Golgi apparatus, following acute in vivo alcoholic intoxication.
