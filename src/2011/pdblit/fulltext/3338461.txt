Glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes was inhibited by incubation with the drugs 1,3-bis(2chloroethy1)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-nitrosourea (HeCNU) under quasi-physiological conditions. For reference purposes, iodoacetamide was used for inactivating alkylation of the enzyme. In each case the modified glutathione reductase was crystallized and its structure determined. These analyses showed that in all experiments the enzyme had reacted at the distal sulfur, that is at the thiol of Cys-58, and virtually nowhere else in the visible structure. The electron density of the HeCNU derivative at 0.3 nm resolution is consistent with a 2-hydroxyethyl group. This alkyl moiety has recently been identified by chemical analysis [Schirmer, R. H., Schollhammer, T., Eisenbrand, G. and Krauth-Siegel, R. L. (1987) Free Radical Res. Commun. 3, 3 - 121. The 0.2 nm resolution electron-density map of the BCNU-derivatized enzyme cannot be explained by a 2-hydroxyethyl group. Instead the modification appears as a carbamoyl moiety containing at least five non-hydrogen atoms. In this derivative the distal cysteine is forced into an unusual conformation. The FAD-enzyme glutathione reductase (GR) catalyzes the reaction NADPH + GSSG + H + 2GSH + NADP' [l, 21. It occurs in two stable forms, E and EH2. E is characterized by a disulfide bridge between Cys-58 and Cys63; for historical reasons this form of GR is often called the 'native' enzyme. The two-electron-reduced form, EH2, contains Cys-58 and Cys-63 as a dithiol [l -41. According to their positions relative to flavin, Cys-58 contains the 'distal' sulfur and Cys-63 the 'proximal' sulfur [S, 61 The enzyme is known to be a target molecule for several drugs [2]. Accordingly the well-known structure of GR from human erythrocytes [6 - 81 has become a basis for drug design. Inhibitors of the antioxidant enzyme are promising agents against parasitic diseases like malaria [9, 101 as well as in cancer therapy [ l l , 121. The first report on the selective inhibition of GR by a nitrosourea derivative was that of Frischer and Ahmad [13]. They found that the enzyme from the red blood cells of a patient was inactive after an antitumor chemotherapy with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-l-nitrosourea (BCNU), which left 19 other erythrocytic enzymes unaffected.

It is not yet known, however, to what extent the inactivation of GR contributes to the cytostatic activity of nitrosoureas. Two mechanisms are known by which the inhibition of GR could impair tumor growth: (a) the resulting build-up of the substrate GSSG could inhibit protein synthesis [2]; (b) the tumor cells may become unable to cope with the cytotoxic reactive-oxygen species launched against them by activated macrophages [ll]. Here we report on the X-ray diffraction analyses of GR inactivated in vitro by BCNU as well as by 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-nitrosourea (HeCNU), a less toxic analogue of BCNU [14]. Both nitrosoureas are used clinically in tumor therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The nitrosoureas BCNU and HeCNU were kind gifts of Dr G. Eisenbrand (Kaiserslautern). Stock solutions (100 mM nitrosourea in ethanol) were prepared daily and kept in the dark at 0 "C. Glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes was isolated and assayed according to Krohne-Ehrich et al. 1151.
Modification o glutathione reductase with BCNU f

Glutathione reductase (8 mg, 200 pM, 80 U/mg) in 100 mM potassium phosphate, 200 mM KCI, 1 mM EDTA was incubated at pH 6.9 with 1.5 mM BCNU plus 260 mM ethanol and 2 mM NADH. NADH was used as the reductant because NAD(H) can be removed more easily from the modified enzyme than the tightly bound NADP(H). After 140 min at 25 "C the residual enzyme activity was 5% when compared with a control sample, which contained all components including ethanol, but no BCNU. The modified, orange-red

194 enzyme was precipitated by adding (NH4)2S04 to 55% saturation. The precipitate was dissolved in 400 p1 H 2 0 and dialyzed against 10% saturated (NH4)2S04 at pH 7.0. The orange-red color is typical for molecular forms of G R which contain Cys-63 as a thiolate and Cys-58 as a free or modified thiol [l-41.
Modifcation o the enzyme with HeCNU f

The procedure was essentially the same as for BCNU but the NADH and HeCNU concentrations were 6 mM and 7 mM respectively. After 3 h incubation at 25"C, more NADH (3 mM ) and HeCNU (13 mkl) were added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 12 h. This led to 50% inhibition of the enzyme. The protein was precipitated and dialyzed as described for BCNU derivatization. It is conceivable that repeated additions of HeCNU might speed up the reaction. In [lo] conditions were used which led to more than 90% inactivation of GR by HeCNU. The modified protein, however, yielded only crystals which were too small for X-ray analysis.

are given in Table 1. Models of the modified enzymes were built using an interactive computer-graphics program [8] and a three-dimensional color vector display (Fa. Stoll, Heidelberg, FRG). For the inhibitor geometries we used the bond angles and bond lengths of analogous parts of amino acid residues [18]. The thioester bond length in the BCNU derivative was taken as 0.178 nm [19]. The BCNU-derivatized GR, with Cyss8-S-CO-NH-CH2-CH2C1included in the model, was refined against data between 1.0 nm and 0.2 nm resolution using the program package of Tronrud et al. [18]. The weights for geometric restraints were the same as the final weights used in the 0.154-nm refinement [8], and the temperature-factor differences between neighboring bound atoms were restrained with a weight of 50. During 13 cycles of coordinate and 8 cycles of temperature-factor refinement, the R factor dropped from 19.0% to 16.8%. The r.m.s. deviations from standard geometry of the final model were 1.5 pm in bond lengths and 2.3 in bond angles.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Crystals o inactivated glutathione reductase f

Glutathione reductase (8 mg, 200 pM, 80 U/mg) in 100 mM potassium phosphate, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA was incubated at pH 8.25 (adjusted with KOH) with 2.5 mM dithioerythritol and 10 mM iodoacetamide. After 60 min at 25 "C in the dark, the residual enzyme activity was 10% and the reaction was stopped by adding dithioerythritol (10 mM final concentration). (NH4)2S04 precipitation and dialysis were done as above.
Crystallization

The derivatized enzyme species were crystallized using the hanging-drop procedure [17], the initial conditions being as follows: drop volume 20 pl, protein concentration 20 mg/ml, (NH4)2S04 saturation lo%, pH 7.0. The droplets were allowed to equilibrate with 30% saturated (NH4)2S04at 4°C. Suitable crystals of (0.5 mm)3 grew within 2 weeks.
Data collection

For most experiments, electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme with a specific activity of 80 U/mg was used. In our experience, G R preparations with high specific activity (above 150 Ujmg) are difficult to crystallize. The usual method for the X-ray analysis of a derivatized protein is to let the modification reaction proceed in protein crystals. After that, a single measurement of all reflections suffices for a difference-Fourier electron-density map showing the changes. Unfortunately this method did not work with BCNU added to crystals of reduced glutathione reductase which need 2 M (NH4)2S04for stabilization; it is likely that the decomposition pattern of BCNU at high ionic strength differs from that under physiological conditions. For this reason, all derivatizations were carried out in solution and the modified enzyme species were crystallized as described under Materials and Methods.
Crystallographic analyses of the modified enzyme species

Crystals of the inhibited enzyme species were isomorphic with those of the native enzyme. For data collection we used an automated X-ray diffractometer (modified model P21, Nicolet Inc.) as described previously [6]. HeCNU-derivatized and iodoacetamide-derivatized enzyme species were each measured to 0.3 nm resolution using a single crystal. Data were measured in seven shells and scaled using the data set of native oxidized GR. Data collection of the BCNU-modified enzyme was carried out in twelve shells using one crystal out to 0.3 nm and five further crystals out to 0.2 nm resolution. Again, scaling was done on the basis of the native data.
Difference Fourier analysis and refinement

For Fourier analyses the data sets of the derivatized enzyme species were scaled to the absolute level of the native data set, and the appropriate coefficients, either Fder F,,, or 2Fde,-F,,, (where Fderand F,,, are the structure-factor amplitudes for the native enzyme and for a derivative), were combined with the calculated phases available from the 0.154nm refinement [8]. Some parameters of the difference maps

The experimental data are summarized in Table 1. Since the BCNU derivative could not be identified by chemical methods [lo], the corresponding X-ray analysis was pursued to high resolution. This was not necessary for the HeCNU derivative, which had turned out to be stable enough for a chemical characterization [lo]. Crystals of carboxamidomethylated GR [4] were prepared and analyzed for reference purposes. For all three derivatives the electron density maps were compared with the model of the native enzyme in its oxidized form, E. In all cases the difference electron-density map resembles that of EH2, the reduced form of glutathione reductase [l, 41: the maximal positive density occurs near the position of the distal sulfur in EH2 and the maximal negative density near the position of the distal sulfur in E. This means that the active-site disulfide of E was opened and that the nascent thiol of Cys-58, the distal sulfur, moved to a new position where it was modified by the pharmacological and chemical agents. None of the experiments indicated a modification of the enzyme in regions apart from the active-site disulfide.This, however, does not exclude a modification of Cys-2 [lo, 201,

which is located in a flexible section and therefore not visible in electron-density maps [ti]. Degree of modification Since all difference Fouriers used in this study have their maxima near the distal sulfur in EH2, the sizes of these maxima can be compared to give the relative occupancies at the new position of the distal sulfur. These occupancies correspond to enzyme modification, because during crystallization, unmodified G R is readily reoxidized back to the native E, which gives no signal in a difference Fourier map. In order to convert relative into absolute occupancies, we used the data from carboxamidomethylated GR, which

contains 90% derivatized enzyme. On this basis only 30% of the distal sulfur was modified by HeCNU. The discrepancy between the enzymatic and crystallographic results for HeCNU-derivatized GR in Table 1 probably reflects the rather large errors in these measurements and not a specific mechanism such as half-site reactivity. For BCNU-derivatized GR we found that the single crystal used for the 0.3 nm resolution map was approximately 100% modified (Table 1). However, the 0.2 nm resolution data based on five crystals indicate that only about 70% of the enzyme was modified by BCNU. This value is deduced from the (2Fd,, - Fna,)exp(iacalc)map (acalc calculated = phases) which showed about 30% residual density at the original position of the distal sulfur, when compared with the

Taken as a whole, the data indicate that BCNU leads to about 90% and HeCNU to about 40% modification of glutathione reductase at the thiol of Cys-58. ous chemical identification, it often yields enough information to distinguish between specific proposals: here, between carbamoylation and alkylation. Already at 0.3 nm resolution it became clear that BCNU and HeCNU lead to different modifications of GR. In Fig. 2B the highest peaks of the corresponding difference maps are The structure o HeCNU-derivatized glutathione reductase f shown to be 0.1 nm apart. In contrast, HeCNU-derivatized Previous peptide analysis of HeCNU-inactivated GR and carboxamidomethylated G R share common maxima glutathione reductase [lo]had shown that CysS8-S-CH2-CH2- positions (data not shown). Improving the resolution of the OH is the major product (Fig. 1) with some additional BCNU-derivatized enzyme revealed a modification starting modification occurring at Cys-2, which does not contribute with a planar trigonally branched group bound to the distal to X-ray diffraction (see above). Therefore, the X-ray analysis sulfur (Fig. 2C). Accordingly the derivative was modelled as yielded a model accounting only for the covalent change at a chloroethylcarbamoyl group (see Fig. 1). The model was then refined against the Fder data set beCys-58 (Fig. 2A). Since the level of derivatization was rather low (Table l), the difference Fourier map is noisy. In Fig. 2A tween 1.0 nm and 0.2 nm resolution. After refinement the map in the region of the modification (Fig. 2D) the density was cut at a level of 33% maximum density, 2Fd,,- Fcalc which is safely above background noise.

In on the observed coordinates. addition the overall density of Fig. 2A is very similar to the The refined model is shown in Fig. 2B, C, D.

Only positive electron density is given. The r.m.s. density of the (Fder--F.,,)exp(ia,,l,) map for the HeCNU derivative at 0.3 nm resolution is 10% of the maximum.

(D) 0.2 nm resolution (2Fder Fcalc)exp(iaCaI,) map after refinement of BCNU-derivatized GR. Residues around the modified Cys-58 are shown along with some solvent molecules ( + ) and hydrogen bonds (- - -). Only the density around the amino acid residues 58, 63 and 467' is shown, it is cut at a contour level of 18% maximum. At this level a tongue of density at the position normally occupied by the distal sulfur (58-Sy) in the oxidized enzyme is clearly visible between atom 58-C/3 and the oxygen of the carbamoyl group. This density represents a small amount of unmodified GR. It should be noted how well the S-carbamoyl group fits into its site, making van der Waals contact with a number of residues

198 The difference map also shows negative density apart from the active-site disulfide (data not shown), indicating that the modification displaces two tightly bound solvent molecules, Sol-70 and Sol-139, which are normally bound in this region. In addition to the change at Cys-58, small movements of Ser30, Val-59, Cys-63, Thr-339, Sol-282 and Sol-359 occur. Most of these movements are associated with the reduction (E + EH2) rather than with the subsequent modification of the enzyme and will be described elsewhere. In conclusion the X-ray analysis of BCNU-inactivated G R clearly reveals an S-carbamoyl moiety at Cys-58 which makes favorable contacts with neighboring amino acid residues. The most likely structure of the whole modifying group (see Fig. 1) is Cys5*-S-CO-NH-CH2-CH2C1,although the chloromethylene group can not be seen. This interpretation is supported by the inhibition of the enzyme by 2-~hloroethylisocyanate,a decomposition product of BCNU [21], and other chemical experiments [lo, 12,21, 221. OUTLOOK Under physiological conditions the reactivity of nitrosoureas appears to be related to their decomposition, which leads to alkylating as well as carbamoylating species (Fig. 1) [14]. BCNU and HeCNU possess very similar alkylating capacities towards DNA [14]. With glutathione reductase in vitro, however, BCNU and HeCNU show very different reaction patterns and rates. Under comparable conditions, inhibition of the enzyme by BCNU is much faster than by HeCNU. The latter probably possesses no carbamoylating activity because of intramolecular cyclization of the intermediately formed 2-hydroxyethylisocyanate (Fig. 1). Studies on GR isolated from BCNU-treated blood and from HeCNUtreated blood are in progress in order to find out whether our in vitro results correspond to the processes in vivo. Here, unexplained discrepancies have to be settled; for instance, poisoning of G R in intact human erythrocytes by HeCNU leads to complete inactivation. This process is about ten times faster than inhibition of the isolated enzyme in vitro [9]. At this time four derivatives of glutathione reductase labelled at Cys-58 have been studied by X-ray diffraction analysis. The modifying groups are derivatives of BCNU and HeCNU (this work), GSSG [4] and iodoacetamide [4]. The corresponding models and that of the S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione . enzyme complex [23] provide a f r exim perimental basis for the design of new inhibitors of G R for various pharmacological purposes [2].
