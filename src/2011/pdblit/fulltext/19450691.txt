OBF-1, a Novel B Cell-Specific Coactivator That Stimulates Immunoglobulin Promoter Activity through Association with Octamer-Binding Proteins
Michel Strubin,* John W. Newell,t and Patrick Matthiast *Department of Genetics and Microbiology University Medical Centre 1211 Geneva 4 Switzerland tFriedrich Miescher Institute 4002 Basel Switzerland same element is critical for the activity of promoters and enhancers of many nonlymphoid-specific genes such as the histone H2B or the U1-U6 small nuclear RNA genes (LaBella et al., 1988; Murphy et al., 1989). Several nuclear proteins binding specifically to the octamer site have been identified and their cDNAs cloned (reviewed by SchSler, 1991). All are members of the POU family of homeodomain proteins sharing a common bipartite DNA-binding domain that comprises an N-terminal POU-specific domain and a C-terminal 'homeodomain (Herr et al., 1988). Two octamer-binding proteins with identical DNA binding specificities are present in B cells: one of them, Oct-l, is a single protein expressed ubiquitously (Sturm et al., 1988), whereas the second, Oct-2, comprises several isoforms and is largely B cell restricted (Staudt et al., 1986; Clerc et al., 1988; MLiller et al., 1988; Wirth et al., 1991). This observation led to the original proposal that the Oct-2 protein has a specialized function in B lymphocytes with respect to immunoglobulin transcription. This model was further supported by the demonstration that overexpression of Oct-2 in non-B cells could efficiently activate octamer-containing promoters (M011er et al., 1988). However, more recent findings challenged this model. First, several B cell lines have been reported to express immunoglobulin genes at high levels and yet to contain only little or no detectable Oct-2 factor (Johnson et al., 1990). Second, in vitro transcription experiments showed that purified Oct-1 or Oct-2 proteins have a similar intrinsic capacity to stimulate an immunoglobulin promoter (Scheidereit et al., 1987; LeBowitz et al., 1988; Pierani et al., 1990; Luo et al., 1992). Third, immunoglobulin genes are rearranged and transcribed normally, and early B cell development appears unaffected in oct-2-deficient mice generated by gene targeting, indicating that Oct-2 is dispensable in the first, antigen-independent phase of B cell differentiation (Corcoran et al., 1993). These observations, together with the finding that immunoglobulin promoters are much more active in unfractionated B cell extracts than in HeLa extracts supplemented with Oct-1 or Oct-2 (Pierani et al., 1990; Luo et al., 1992), suggested that other B cell-specific components are responsible for lymphoidrestricted transcription of immunoglobulin promoters. Indeed, a protein fraction has been recently isolated from a B cell nuclear extract that specifically stimulates transcription from an immunoglobulin promoter in conjunction with purified Oct-1 or Oct-2. The factor responsible for this activity has been called OCA-B and has been proposed to function as a B cell-specific coactivator for octamer proteins (Luo et al., 1992). We used a transcription-based selection for protein-protein interactions in yeast to identify proteins that can interact with Oct-l. Here we report the isolation of Oct proteinbinding factor 1 (OBF-1), a B cell-restricted protein that specifically interacts with both Oct-1 and Oct-2, but not with the octamer motif. We also present evidence for a direct role of OBF-1 as a coactivator for octamer-binding

Summary Recent biochemical and genetic studies indicate that in addition to the octamer-binding proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2, other B cell components are required for lymphoid-restricted, octamer site-mediated immunoglobulin gene promoter activity. Using a genetic screen in yeast, we have isolated B cell-derived cDNAs encoding Oct-binding factor 1 (OBF-1), a novel protein that specifically associates with Oct-1 and Oct-2o Biochemical studies demonstrate that OBF-1 has no intrinsic DNA-binding activity and recognizes the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2, but not those of Oct-4 and Oct-6. The OBF.1 mRNA is expressed in a highly cell-specific manner, being most abundant in B cells and essentially absent in most of the other cells or tissues tested. Furthermore, expression of OBF-1 in HeLa cells selectively stimulates the activity of a natural immunoglobulin promoter in an octamer site-dependent manner. Thus, OBF-1 has all the properties expected for a B cell-specific transcriptional coactivator protein.

Introduction The B cell-restricted expression of immunoglobulin genes is dependent on promoter and enhancer elements that are B cell-specific in their activity. The most conspicuous regulatory element of immunoglobulin genes is the octamer motif (consensus sequence ATTTGCAT) that is present in every immunoglobulin promoter and in most immunoglobulin enhancers (reviewed by Staudt and Lenardo, 1991). The critical role of the octamer motif for high level activity of immunoglobulin promoters in B lymphocytes has been well documented (Falkner and Zachau, 1984; Mason et al., 1985; Mizushima-Sugano and Roeder, 1986; Jenuwein and Grosschedl, 1991). Deletion of this promoter element results in a drastic reduction of immunoglobulin gene expression, and a single octamer motif is sufficient to confer B cell specificity to a heterologous minimal promoter (Dreyfus et al., 1987; Wirth et al., 1987). In addition, multimerization of an octamer site creates a potent B cell-specific enhancer able to activate transcription from a remote position (Gerster et al., 1987). However, B cell-restricted activity of the immunoglobulin octamer motif must also depend on the promoter context, as this

Isolation of OBF-1, a Protein That Interacts with Oct-1 and Oct-2 in Yeast To isolate cDNAs encoding proteins that associate with Oct-l, we used a yeast genetic selection related to twohybrid protein interaction screening (Fields and Song, 1989). We first constructed a parental yeast strain carrying as a selectable marker gene an integrated copy of a HIS3 allele with six octamer motifs upstream of the TATA element (Figure 1). The cells also contain a centromeric plasmid marked with the URA3 gene that directs constitutive expression of Oct-l. As Oct-1 cannot activate transcription in yeast (see below), the resulting tester strain transcribes the HIS3 gene at basal levels and thus grows on medium lacking histidine but not in the presence of aminotriazole (AT), a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product. The strain was then transformed with a library of randomly primed cDNA fragments prepared with mRNA from the B cell line Namalwa, fused C.terminal to the transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) VP16 protein, and expressed from a centromeric TRP1 plasmid under control of a galactose-inducible promoter (Figure 1). The library (2 x 106 primary transformants) was first amplified in glucose medium lacking uracil and tryptophan to maintain selection for both plasmids, before being plated onto medium containing galactose, which induces expression of the fusion library, and 10 mM AT. Cells that grow under these selective conditions must express VP16

hybrid proteins that stimulate HIS3 transcription either by interacting directly with HIS3 regulatory sequences or by being recruited to the HIS3 promoter through their interaction with DNA-bound Oct-l. Among the 55 AT-resistant colonies that were further considered, four lost their ability to grow on AT when their Oct-1 plasmids were removed, indicating that in these cells transactivation resulted from the formation of a complex between Oct-1 and the protein fused to VP16. Partial sequence analysis of the library plasmids recovered from these colonies revealed that they contained three independent cDNA inserts derived from the same cellular mRNA. On the basis of its ability to interact specifically with Oct-l, we named the protein encoded by this mRNA OBF-1, for Oct protein-binding factor 1. To confirm more directly that OBF-1 requires Oct-1 for recruitment to the octamer site and to assess its ability to interact with the other octamer-binding protein present in B lymphocytes, we tested the activity of an octamerdependent HIS3 gene in cells expressing VP16-tagged OBF-1 either alone or in combination with Oct-1 or Oct-2. Figure 2 shows that yeast cells expressing any of these proteins individually were unable to activate the HIS3 gene and, therefore, failed to grow in the presence of AT. However, when either Oct-1 or Oct-2 was coexpressed with VP16-OBF-1 in the reporter strain, transactivation of the HIS3 gene occurred. Moreover, expression was completely dependent on the presence of wild-type octamer sequences in the HIS3 promoter. We concluded from these experiments that OBF-1 fused to VP16 has no independent transcriptional activity and requires promoter-bound Oct-1 or Oct-2 factors to stimulate octamer site-dependent transcription in yeast.

OBF-1 Is a Novel Protein Expressed Only in B Cells The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert with the longest 5' extension was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence is presented in Figure 3. OBF-1 is a novel protein of 256 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 27.4 kDa and an apparent molecular mass of about 35 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels after in vitro translation (data not shown). This protein shows no obvious similarities to any known protein and, except for its richness in proline residues that are scattered throughout

the entire sequence (41 residues or 16%), does not display any particular structural features. The pattern of OBF-1 expression was determined in various organs and cell lines by Northern blot analyses. A major RNA species of about 3.2 kb was detected in splee n, in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and, very weakly, in thymus and small intestine (Figure 4A). Prostate, testis, ovary, and colon were negative (Figure 4A), as well as brain, skeletal muscle, placenta, lung, kidney, and pancreas (data not shown). OBF-1 is strongly expressed in all human B cell lines tested (Figure 4B, lanes 3-5), and a similarly sized RNA was detected in two mouse B cell lines (lanes 1-2). By contrast, no OBF-1 mRNA was found in several non-B cells such as HeLa, 293T, MCF7, and K562 or in the T cell line HUT78. Taken together, these data indicate that the OBF-1 gene is expressed in a highly B lymphocyte-specific manner.

OBF-1 Interacts Specifically with the POU Domain of Oct-1 and Oct-2 to Form a Ternary Complex on DNA
The experiments carried out in yeast provide genetic evidence for a recruitment of OBF-1 to the octamer site through its physical association with Oct-1 or Oct-2. To confirm this more directly, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide bearing a single octamer motif and nuclear extracts from 293T cells transiently transfected with vectors encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged version of OBF-1, Oct-2, or both. Figure 5 shows that in addition to the single complex formed with extracts from controltransfected cells and owing to binding of endogenous Oct-1 to the DNA (lanes 2, 4, and 5), a second, slowermigrating complex was observed with extracts from cells expressing OBF-1 (lanes 6, 8, and 9). Two additional complexes were formed in the presence of Oct-2. The fastermigrating complex resulted from independent binding of Oct-2 to the octamer motif (Figure 5, lanes 10, 12, and

13), and the upper complex was only observed with extracts from cells expressing both Oct-2 and OBF-1 (lanes 14, 16, and 17). Addition of the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the HA epitope present on OBF-1 specifically affected migration of the OBF-l-dependent complexes (Figure 5, lanes 8 and 16), and this effect was abolished by inclusion of the HA peptide to the antibodysupplemented reactions (lanes 9 and 17). These data demonstrate that OBF-1 forms a ternary complex with Oct-1 or Oct-2 on the cognate site. The POU domain is the only region of extensive similarity between Oct-1 and Oct-2 (Herr et al., 1988) and is therefore likely to provide the surface for interaction with OBF-1. This possibility was directly examined by testing the ability of in vitro translated O8F-1 and POU domains of various octamer factors to form a complex on DNA. Figure 6A shows that the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 were indeed sufficient for interaction with OBF-1, whereas no complex was formed between OBF-1 and the same do-

mains of the more divergent POU proteins Oct-4/Oct-3 (SchSler et al., 1990; O k a m o t o et al., 1990) and Oct-6/ SCIP (Suzuki et al., 1990; Monuki et al., 1990). Importantly, no p r o t e i n - D N A c o m p l e x was observed after incubation of the DNA probe with OBF-1 alone, indicating that this protein is unable to interact stably with the octamer motif on its own. When C-terminally truncated versions of OBF-1 were used with the POU domain of Oct-l, complexes of increasing mobility were observed (Figure 6B). These e x p e r i m e n t s provide further evidence that OBF-1 is present in a ternary complex, and they localize the domain mediating interaction with o c t a m e r factors within the first 120 a m i n o acids of OBF-1. Although OBF-1 exhibits no independent DNA-binding activity, its association with octamer factors may stabilize their interaction with the octarner motif. To address this issue, we c o m p a r e d the rates of dissociation of Oct-1 and OBF-1-Oct-1 from the o c t a m e r motif. As shown in Figure 6C, the dissociation rate of Oct-1 from its binding site was not influenced by the presence of OBF-1 in the complex. Identical results were obtained when Oct-2 was used in place of Oct-l. OBF-1 was also found to have no effect on the kinetics of Oct-1 and Oct-2 binding to their cognate s e q u e n c e (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments d e m o n s t r a t e that OBF-1 has no intrinsic DNAbinding activity and that it interacts indirectly with the oct a m e r motif through its specific association with the POU d o m a i n s of Oct-1 and Oct-2.

Figure 6. Specific Interaction of OBF-1 with the POU Domain of Oct-1 and Oct-2 (A) EMSA performed with constant amounts of reticulocyte lysates programmed with plasmid DNAs encoding the POU domains of Oct-1 (lanes 5-7), Oct-2 (lanes 8-10), Oct-4 (lanes 11-13), and Oct-6 (lanes 14-16) combined with increasing amounts of OBF-I' lysate. The total amount of lysate was equalized in each reaction by the addition of unprogrammed lysate. The low amounts of Oct-1 protein present in the reticulocyte lysate forms a faint complex with the DNA probe, part of which gives rise to a lower mobility complex in the presence of OBF-1 (small arrows). (B) EMSA performed with the POU domain of Oct-1 in combination with either full-length OBF-1 (lane 3) or with derivatives truncated at amino acid 193 (lane 4), amino acid 139 (lane 5), or amino acid 119 (lane 6). (C) Dissociation rates of Oct-1 (lower panel) and OBF-1-Oct-1 (upper panel) from the octamer site.

Transient Expression of OBF-1 in Non-B Cells Stimulates the Activity of an Immunoglobulin Light Chain Promoter
The strong correlation between the expression pattern of OBF-1 with that of immunoglobulin genes suggests a role for this protein in B cell-restricted activity of immunoglobulin promoters. To address this issue, we assessed whether expression of OBF-1 would be sufficient to stimulate transcription from an immunoglobulin promoter in n o n - B cells. As a target gene, we used a hybrid plasmid containing the coding sequences of the luciferase gene under the

(B) Activities of the reporter plasmids pKappaLucEand pH2BLucE upon cotransfectionwith an empty expressionvector (lanes 1 and 3) or the OBF-1 expressionvector (lanes 2 and 4) in HeLa cells. The relativefold stimulationby OBF-1 is indicated.

In addition, we have tested the effect of OBF-1 on transcription from the histone H2B promoter, whose activity is also dependent upon an intact octamer element (Pierani et al., 1990). Figure 7B shows that a 325 bp fragment encompassing the natural H2B promoter supports higher levels of transcription than the immunoglobulin K promoter after transient transfection into HeLa cells (lanes 1 and 3). This is expected, as the H2B gene is ubiquitously expressed. Cotransfection of OBF-1 stimulates H2B promoter activity only about 2-fold, which contrasts with the 7- to 10-fold effect of OBF-1 on transcription from the immunoglobulin promoter (Figure 7B, lanes 2 and 4). Hence, OBF-1 exhibits a marked promoter preference. The high basal level transcription of the H2B promoter construct is explained by the presence of an SV40 enhancer downstream of the luciferase gene. The same enhancer is also present in the immunoglobulin promoter constructs, where it is required to reach detectable levels of transcription in non-B cells. Although removal of the SV40 enhancer reduces H2B promoter activity roughly to basal immunoglobulin promoter levels, it does not increase its responsiveness to OBF-1 (data not shown). The weak but reproducible effect of OBF-t on the histone H2B promoter suggests that B cell components such as OBF-1 may contribute to the activity of ubiquitous promoters in B cells.

Discussion
The crucial role of the octamer motif for high level activity of immunoglobulin promoters in B cells has been well documented. As mentioned in the Introduction, recent data indicate that the two octamer-binding proteins present in B lymphocytes require additional B cell components to mediate cell-restricted immunoglobulin promoter activity (Pierani et al., 1990; Luo et al., 1992). Here we describe the molecular cloning and initial characterization of a protein that has all the properties expected for a cell-specific and transcriptio n factor-specific coactivator. We designated this protein OBF-I. OBF-1 is a novel protein expressed only in B cells that has no intrinsic DNA-binding activity and that interacts specifically with Oct-1 and Oct-2 on promoter DNA. Furthermore, expression of OBF-1 in fibroblast cells that only contain Oct-1 is sufficient to activate efficiently an immunoglobulin promoter specifically through the octamer motif. Recently, Luo et al. (1992) described a protein fraction isolated from a B cell extract that activates transcription of an artificial immunoglobulin promoter construct by potentiating the activity of purified Oct-1 or Oct-2 but not of other activators. The factor responsible for this activity, called OCA-B, could not be purified from HeLa nuclear extracts and did not exhibit independent transcription activation or DNA-binding activities, much like OBF-I. However, although OCA-B did function with both Oct-1 and Oct-2, a physical association could only be demonstrated with Oct-l, unlike what we have shown for OBF-I. In addition, OCA-B had no effect on activity of the histone H2B promoter, whereas OBF-1 weakly but reproducibly stimulates the H2B promoter in

control of a 200 bp immunoglobulin 1< light chain gene promoter fragment (Junker et al., 1990). This promoter contains a single octamer motif upstream of the TATA element and supports low levels of transcription after transient transfection into HeLa cells that only express the ubiquitous Oct-1 factor (Figure 7A, lane 1). This basal activity was strongly stimulated upon cotransfection of the OBF-1 expression vector (Figure 7A, lane 2) to a level of transcription significantly higher than that observed when a vector expressing Oct-2 was used (lane 3). Interestingly, cotransfection of OBF-1 and Oct-2 led to even higher immunoglobulin promoter activity (Figure 7A, lane 4), indicating that both octamer-binding proteins that form a ternary complex with OBF-1 on DNA in vitro can mediate OBF-1 transactivation in vivo. Activated transcription was strictly dependent on the presence of an intact octamer motif, as mutations in this element (Figure 7A, lanes 5-7) render the promoter nonresponsive to OBF-I. Furthermore, replacement of the octamer motif within the K promoter by an SPl-binding site creates a chimeric promoter that is active, but not influenced by OBF-1 (Figure 7A, lanes 8-10).

transient transfection experiments. Therefore, it is at present difficult to estimate to what extent OBF-1 and OCA-B are related proteins.

Potential Role of OBF-1 for B Cell-Restricted Immunoglobulin Gene Activity We have found that expression of the OBF-1 gene is highly B lymphocyte specific: spleen, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and thymus were the only organs in which OBF-1 mRNA was found, albeit at quite different levels (Figure 4A). In addition, OBF-1 expression was also detected weakly in the small intestine, an organ that contains some B cells in the form of Peyer's patches. Of the various cell lines tested, only B cells were positive. The finding that OBF-1 is expressed in the pre-B cell line Nalm6 is of particular interest, as these cells had been shown to contain extremely low levels of Oct-2 protein, yet transcribe high levels of immunoglobulin mRNA (Johnson et al., 1990). Thus, OBF-1 is differentially expressed with a pattern that coincides with that of immunoglobulin genes. Expression of OBF-1 in HeLa cells efficiently activates a cotransfected immunoglobulin K light chain promoter construct, while it has only a modest effect on histone H2B promoter activity. For this effect, integrity of the octamer motif is essential because mutation of the octamer site or its replacement by an SPl-binding site renders the immunoglobulin promoter nonresponsive to OBF-1. In these cells, OBF-1 necessarily acts in conjunction with the endogenous Oct-1 factor, which is the only octamer-binding protein present in fibroblasts. By contrast, B cells also express the Oct-2 protein in addition to Oct-l, and therefore OBF-1 might activate immunoglobulin transcription in association with Oct-2 as well. Since no mammalian cell line is available lacking Oct-l, we could not directly test that possibility. However, cotransfection experiments with Oct-2 and OBF-1 in HeLa cells indicated that OBF-1 is able to stimulate immunoglobulin transcription in conjunction with Oct-2 alsb (Figure 7A). In addition to being present in all immunoglobulin promoters, the octamer motif is also found in most immunoglobulin enhancers, where it contributes to their B cellrestricted activity. Furthermore, multimerized octamer sites behave as B cell-specific enhancers, capable of stimulating transcription from remote positions (Gerster et al., 1987). The Oct-2 protein is necessary for enhancer function (Annweiler et al., 1992; Pfisterer et al., 1994) but not sufficient (Mfiller-lmmergluck et al., 1990): an additional B cell-restricted activity is also required (Annweiler et al., 1992). Whether OBF-1 encodes this stimulating activity is not yet established, but genetic evidences suggest that activity of promoter and enhancer octamer sites requires distinct cofactors (Pfisterer et al., 1994; Feldhaus et al., 1993). However that may be, the very highly B lymphocyte-specific pattern of OBF-1 expression together with its selective stimulatory effect on immunoglobulin promoters strongly indicates that OBF-1 is a critical determinant of immunoglobulin transcription in lymphoid cells.

OBF-1 Is a Novel Protein Rich in Proline Residues OBF-1 is a novel protein of 256 amino acids that does not contain any obvious structural or functional motifs. In particular, this protein does not show any similarity to known DNA-binding domains and is devoid of regions rich in basic amino acids, consistent with its inability to interact with DNA on its own. OBF-1 is rich in proline residues (16%) and, to a lesser extent, in serine and threonine residues scattered throughout the entire protein. Proline-rich activation domains have been previously reported for several transcription factors, such as NF-1/CTF1 (Mermod et al., 1989) or AP-2 (Williams et al., 1988); thus, it is possible that some parts of OBF-1 serve a similar function. Interestingly, the central region of OBF-1 (positions 86-151) shows a weak homology (24% identity or 38% similarity by FASTA comparison) to amino acids 570-639 of CCG 1, a human protein initially implicated in cell cycle regulation (Sekiguchi et al., 1991) that has been recently shown to correspond to the 250 kDa TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAF250 (Ruppert et al., 1993; Hisatake et al., 1993). This homology falls in a region of TAF250/CCG1 to which no function has been ascribed so far (Hisatake et al., 1993) and therefore may define a novel domain in this protein. OBF-1, a Novel Modulator for Octamer Factors Octamer-binding proteins constitute an interesting family of transcription factors in that they appear critically to depend for their function on additional proteins. For example, Oct-1 and another member of the POU family of transcription factors, Pit-l, form a heteromeric complex in the absence of DNA and function synergistically in transactivating the expression of a pituitary-specific gene through their codependent binding to the Pit-1 response element (Voss et al., 1991). In a similar way, activation of the interleukin-2 promoter requires a complex between Oct-1 and AP-1 or OAP 4° (Pfeuffer et al., 1994; UIIman et al., 1991); OAP 4° is a heterodimer between two members of the Jun family that reduces the dissociation rate of Oct-1 from its cognate site by interacting with adjacent DNA sequences (UIIman et al., 1991). In these two cases, Oct-1 interacts with proteins that also function as independent transcription factors. However, other cases have been reported in which the activity of octamer factors is potentiated by protein components, such as OBF-1, that must function as coactivators as they exhibit no independent DNA-binding and transcriptional activities. For example, Oct-1 activates transcription of HSV immediate-early genes through its binding to the TAATGARAT motif only in association with the viral protein VP16 (O'Hare and Goding, 1988; Gerster and Roeder, 1988; Kristie et al., 1989) and a host cell factor, HCF (Wilson et al., 1993). Another example is illustrated by Oct-4, which requires adenovirus E1A protein for activating transcription through distal octamer sites in a way that correlates with formation of a complex between the two proteins on DNA (Sch~ler et al., 1991). An activity functionally analogous to E1A has been identified in embryocarcinoma cells and proposed to represent a cellular

OBF-1, a B Lymphocyte-SpecificCoactivator 503

coactivator specific for Oct-4 (SchSler et al., 1991). Here we present evidence that high level activity of immunoglobulin promoters in B cells requires the recruitment of OBF-1 to the promoter through its association with Oct-l, Oct-2, or both. Interestingly, E1A, VP16, and OBF-1 all interact with octamer factors via their POU domain. Yet the three proteins exhibit distinct specificities: whereas E 1A recognizes Oct-4, VP16 binds to only Oct-l, and OBF-1 interacts equally with both Oct-1 and Oct-2, but not with Oct-4 and Oct-6 (Figure 6A). Oct-1 and Oct-2 are closely related members of the same class of POU proteins, whereas Oct-4 and Oct-6 are more divergent and belong to different classes. It is therefore highly unlikely that OBF-1 is the embryocarcinoma cell-specific E1A-like activity, although one cannot exclude the possibility that the two proteins are related. Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins share highly related POU domains that only differ by one residue in the 75 amino acid long POU-specific domain and by seven residues in the 60 amino acid long POU homeodomain. A glutamic acid at position 22 in the first helix of the Oct-1 homeodomain was shown to be the single critical residue for VP16 to discriminate between Oct-1 and Oct-2 (Lai et al., 1992; Pomerantz et al., 1992). The observation that OBF-1 associates with both Oct-1 and Oct-2 may suggest that, unlike VP16, this protein recognizes the POU-specific domain rather than the POU homeodomain, and it will be interesting to define further which part of the octamer proteins is mediating OBF-1 recognition.
Mechanism of Transcription Activation by OBF-1

binding to the octamer motif (Figure 6C). Thus, it does not appear to increase the activity of octamer factors by stabilizing their interaction with DNA. OBF-1 must therefore function in a coactivator or adaptor-like fashion by creating a bridge connecting octamer site-bound transcription factors to some component of the basal machinery. In that respect, it will be recalled that OBF-1 has some of the features of proline-rich activation domains such as the one found in transcription factor CTF1 (Mermod et al., 1989), which has recently been reported to contact TFIIB directly (Kim and Roeder, 1994). Coactivators constitute a class of eukaryotic factors operationally defined as proteins that are required for transcription factor function but that have no independent transcriptional activities. Coactivators include the TAFs present in the TFIID complex (Tanese and Tjian, 1993). OBF-1 may therefore represent a cell type-specific TAF, and it will be interesting to test whether it can be found in a TFIID subcomplex. Until recently, the prevailing view was that cell typespecific regulation of gene transcription is mediated by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins whose expression or activity is restricted to the corresponding cells. Immunoglobulin genes may represent an example in which such a strategy does not strictly apply, as their cellrestricted expression is likely to require the B cell-specific coactivator.OBF-1 for function of octamer factors on the immunoglobulin promoters. One may speculate that a similar mechanism could specify restricted expression of other cell type-specific genes, such as those for which no difference in promoter occupancy can be observed.
Experimental Procedures

By which mechanism does OBF-1 potentiate the activity of octamer-binding transcription factors in B cells? One possibility is that this protein functions by modifying catalytically octamer factors, thereby enhancing their activation potential. Alternatively, OBF-1 could facilitate nuclear translocation of these factors in B cells. However, it is more likely that OBF-1 exerts its effect on the immunoglobulin promoter itself. First, the protein is clearly able to translocare into the nucleus, as it can be found in association with Oct-1 or Oct-2 in nuclear extracts from transfected cells. Second, fusion of the potent VP16 acidic activation domain to OBF-1 results in a chimeric protein that mediates significantly higher immunoglobulin promoter activity in cotransfection assays (data not shown). Numerous experiments have demonstrated that the VP16 activation domain stimulates RNA polymerase II transcription only when tethered to a promoter through its fusion to a heterologous DNA-binding domain or through interaction with a promoter-bound protein. The same situation must therefore also apply in the case of the VP16-OBF-1 hybrid protein, thus implying the presence of OBF-1 on the immunoglobulin promoter. As the OBF-1 protein does not interact With DNA on its own, it must be recruited to the immunoglobulin promoter through association with DNA-bound octamer factors. Kinetic experiments indicated that OBF-1 has no effect on the association or dissociation rates of octamer proteins

Yeast Strains and Expression Vectors

The yeaststrainsare derivativesof KY320(relevantgenotypeura3-52 trpl-D1 his3-200 GAL÷; Chen and Struhl, 1988) into which the HIS3 locus was replacedby the relevantHIS3 alleles.These alleleswere constructedby insertingrestrictionfragmentsor syntheticoligonucleotides containingwild-type or mutated octamer motifs at the unique EcoRIsite of YIp55-Sc3760(Harburyand Struhl, 1989).The Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteinswereexpressedconstitutivelyfrom pRS316by inserting the protein-codingregions between regulatorysequences derived from the yeastTBP gene(Cormacket ai., 1991).Bothproteinscontain an N-terminalSV40 nuclearlocalizationsignal.

Construction of an Activation Domain-Tagged cDNA Library Derived from B Cell mRNA

Total RNAwas isolatedfrom the humanB lymphoidcell line Namalwa (ATCC CRL 1432)by lysingthe cells with guanidiumthiocyanateand purification of the RNA over CsTFA gradients, mRNA was purified by two roundsof chromatographyon oligo(dT)columns, cDNA was synthesizedusing the SuperScriptChoiceSystem from Life Technol-

Cell 504

ogies. First-strand synthesis was performed using 5 p.g of poly(A)÷ RNA and was primed with 1 p.g of oligo(dT) and 50 ng of random hexamers. After second-strand synthesis, small cDNAs were eliminated by passing over a Sepharose 4CLB column, and the eluate was ligated to Sill adaptors. Adaptor-ligated cDNA was size fractionated by passing over a Sephacryl column, and the fractions were EtOH precipitated individually. The library vector was prepared by digestion with Sfil and purification over sucrose gradients in the presence of EtBr. cDNA-vector ligation reactions were set up with 50 ng of vector and varying amounts of size-fractionated cDNA. Aliquots were used for electroporation of DH10B bacteria. For amplification, the products of several electroporations were pooled (107 individual transformants) and plated onto LB-agar plates containing 100 I~g/ml ampicillin at a density of 50,000 cfu per 132 mm plate. After growth at 37°C, the colonies were collected and pooled. An aliquot was frozen for future reamplification, and the rest was used for plasmid DNA preparation.

Screening of VP16-cDNA Fusion Library Screening of the cDNA library was done in a yeast strain carrying a H/S3 allele with six octamer sites upstream of the TATA element and expressing Oct-1 from a centromedc plasmid, The fusion library was introduced into the reporter strain according to the method of Schiestl and Gietz (1989), except that human poly(A)- RNA was used as carrier in place of salmon sperm DNA. An estimated 2 x 106 double transformants were grown for 16 hr at 30°C in glucose-selective medium, at which time the culture consisted of approximately 25% Trp*/Ura ÷ cells. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in galactose medium and incubated for 5 hr at 30°C to induce expression of the hybrid protein library. Transformants v~ere then plated on galactose synthetic medium lacking histidine and containing 10 mM AT; 55 ATresistant colonies were selected for subsequent analyses. They were grown on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan but containing uracil before being plated on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select against cells expressing Oct-1 from the UFIA3 plasmid. The resulting Ura-/Trp÷ segregants were then tested for growth on AT-containing medium. The library plasmids were recovered from the transformants that lost their ability to grow on AT when their Oct-1 plasmid was removed according to the method of Robzyk and Kassir (1992). The ability of OBF-1 to induce HIS3 transcription in conjunction with Oct-1 and Oct-2 was determined by introducing the corresponding plasmids into yeast strains carrying HIS3 alleles bearing wild-type (Hw) or mutated (H,,) immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter-derived octamerbinding sites. Phenotypic analysis of the Ura*/Trp÷ transformants was carried out by spotting approximately 104 cells onto minimal media lacking histidine or containing 40 mM AT. DNA Sequencing The DNA sequence of the OBF-1 cDNA clone with the longest 5'extension (pRS314/UNVP16/clone 9) has been determined by the chain termination method. RNA and DNA Analyses Northern blot analysis was done by running 15 ~g of total RNA or 1 lig of poly(A)÷ RNA from various cell lines on formaldehyde-agarose gels as described (Ausubel et al., 1990). The RNA was blotted onto GeneScreen membranes that were UV cross-linked. In the case of the organ RNAs, a commercial blot (Clontech) was used. The filters were hybridized at 44°C in 50% formamide, 5 x SSC, 5 x Denhardt's solution, 0.05% NaPPi, 1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 2 x 106 cpm/ml of the 32P-labeled OBF-1 fragment (2 kb of Sill insert present in clone 9). After hybridization, the filters were washed in 1 x SSC, 0.1o/0 SDS at 50°C and in 0.5x SSC, 0.1O/o SDS at 50°C. Nuclear Extracts, In Vitro Translations, and EMSAs Nuclear extracts from transfected mammalian cells were done as described previously (MOller-lmmergluck et al., 1990). For in vitro translations, TNT reticulocyte lysates (Promega) were used following the instructions of the manufacturer. All plasmids used for in vitro translation are based on pBGO or pBGO-ATG, two Bluescript derivatives that contain rabbit ~-globin leader sequences downstream of the phage T3 promoter (T. Brabletz and P. M., unpublished data), pBGO-ATG-OBF-1 contains the OBF-1 clone 9 cDNA. pBGO-Octl contains the Oct-1

cDNA and pBGO-Oct2 the Oct-2a cDNA. The POU domains present in pBGO-ATG-POU1, pBGO-ATG-POU2, pBGO-ATG-POU4, or pBGOATG-POU6 were prepared by PCR amplification from plasmids containing the corresponding cDNAs, pBGO-ATG-POU1 contains amino acids 296-455 of the Oct-1 protein (Sturm et al., 1988), pBGO-ATGPOU2 contains amino acids 193-355 of the Oct-2a protein (MLiller et al., 1988), pBGO-ATG-POU4 contains amino acids 98-254 of the Oct-4 protein (SchSler et al., 1990), and pBGO-ATG-POU6 contains amino acids 238-395 of the Oct-6 protein (Suzuki et al., 1990). EMSA reactions were performed at room temperature with 10 fmol of a 32P-labeled 50 bp Sail DNA fragment containing the octamer site from the intron IgH enhancer. The binding buffer contained 50 mM KCI, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, and 4% Ficol1400. Reactions with nuclear extracts contained 5-7 p.g of nuclear proteins, 2 p.g of poly(dl-dC), and 0.4 lig of denatured salmon sperm DNA. Reactions with reticulocyte lysates contained a total of 2 p.I of reticulocyte lysate, 0.4 p.g of poly(dl-dC), and 0.1 p.g of denatured salmon sperm DNA. When used, 1 p.I of the rnonoclonal antibody 12CA5 (BAbCo) was added (at 1:50 dilution); in some reactions, 3 lig of the HA peptide was added as well. Gels were prerun for 2 hr and run for 2.5 hr at 200 V.

Mammalian Expression and Luciferase Assays For expression in mammalian cells, the OBF-1 cDNA (clone 9) was inserted into the CMV-based expression vector pEVRF0 (Matthias et al., 1989) to create pEV-OBF-1, pEV-HA-OBF-1 was made by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding the HA epitope at the 5' end of the OBF-1 cDNA present in pEV-OBF-1. The reporter plasmids pKappaLucE, pKappaO-LucE, and pKappaSP1LucE were made by inserting the 200 bp K promoter fragment from the corresponding NK-globin plasmid (Junker et al., 1990) into the pGL2 enhancer plasmid. The pH2BLucE plasmid was made similarly by cloning a 325 bp PCR fragment containing the human H2B histone gene promoter (positions -295 to +31). Cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate coprecipitation using 3 p.g of reporter plasmid and varying amounts of expression vector DNA (from 0.5 to 5 lig); in each sample, the total amount of expression vector DNA (5 p,g) was kept constant by the addition of pEVRF0 DNA, and the total amount of DNA was brought to 20 I~g with salmon sperm DNA. Luciferase extracts were prepared 48-60 hr after transfection (Ausubel et al,, 1990), and equivalent protein amounts (100 p.g) were used for luciferase assays. Acknowledgments
