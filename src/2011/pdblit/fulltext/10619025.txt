Abstract Laminin G domain-like ZLG. modules of approximately 180 200 residues are found in a number of extracellular and receptor proteins and often are present in tandem arrays. LG modules are implicated in interactions with cellular receptors Zintegrins, -dystroglycan., sulfated carbohydrates and other extracellular ligands. The recently determined crystal structures of LG modules of the laminin 2 chain reveal a compact sandwich fold and identify a novel calcium binding site. Binding epitopes for heparin, sulfatides and -dystroglycan have been mapped by site-directed mutagenesis and show considerable overlap. The epitopes are located in surface loops around the calcium site, which in other proteins Zagrin, neurexins . are modified by alternative splicing. Efficient ligand binding often requires LG modules to be present in tandem. The close proximity of the N- and C-termini in the LG module, as well as a unique link region between laminin LG3 and LG4, impose certain constraints on the arrangement of LG tandems. Further modifications may be introduced by proteolytic processing of laminin G domains, which is known to occur in the 2, 3 and 4 chains. 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.rInternational Society of Matrix Biology.

1. Introduction Most extracellular matrix proteins are of considerable size owing to their complex modular architecture. More than 70 types of modules have been identified so far, which vary in size between 30 and 350 residues and exhibit a wide range of folds ZBork et al., 1996; Engel and Bozik, 1999.. Laminin G domain-like ZLG. modules of 180 200 residues were first identified in laminins, developmentally regulated Drosophila proteins and other extracellular proteins, such as sex hormone-binding proteins ZJoseph and Baker, 1992; Patthy, 1992; Sasaki et al., 1988.. LG modules share only moderate sequence identity Z20 45%.. They were predicted to have a fold similar to those of
U

pentraxins and thrombospondin N-terminal ZTN. modules ZBeckmann et al., 1998.. Some LG modules share binding properties for cellular receptors and carbohydrate ligands, indicating that the LG fold may have evolved for participation in related functions. Recently crystal structures were obtained for two LG modules of laminin ZHohenester et al., 1999; Tisi et al., 2000., allowing a structural interpretation of laminin binding epitopes previously identified by sitedirected mutagenesis ZAndac et al., 1999; Talts et al., 1999..

2. Basic features of LG modules A tandem of five LG modules ZLG1 LG5. was initially identified within the C-terminus of the laminin 1 chain ZSasaki et al., 1988. and subsequently shown to be present in all five laminin chains Z 1 5. known so far ZSasaki and Timpl, 1999.. These mod-

ules of approximately 180 residues show only moderate sequence conservation Zup to 45% identity. and are not interrupted by other modules, with the single exception of a long linker between LG3 and LG4. Their closest relatives are the LG modules in the C-terminal regions of perlecan and agrin, but these are separated from one another by one or two EGFlike modules ZFig. 1.. Altogether approximately 80 LG modules have been identified in diverse families of extracellular and transmembrane proteins, where they occur as single modules or pairs. Proteins containing LG modules include neurexin receptors, the Drosophila proteins crumbs, slit and fat, sex hormonebinding globulin, the complement protein S and the kinase receptor ligand Gas6 ZJoseph and Baker, 1992; Patthy, 1992; Beckmann et al., 1998; Rudenko et al., 1999.. More distantly related are the pentraxins Zserum amyloid protein, C-reactive protein. that bind to carbohydrate ligands and the TN modules Zalso refered to as PARP., which are found at the Nterminus of four thrombospondins and N-terminal to the triple helix of 10 different collagen chains ZBeckmann et al., 1998; Ayad et al., 1999.. Laminin LG modules contain between two and four cysteines, with one pair forming a disulfide bridge close to the C-terminus Zsee below.. Most LG modules are modified by N-glycosylation, due to the presence of one to three consensus acceptor sequences ZNXT, NXS.. Alternative splicing is another way to modify the LG structure, but in laminins this has so far been only identified for a tetrapeptide sequence of the laminin 2 chain LG2 module ZTalts et al., 1998.. Splice variation is much more frequent and of considerable biological impact in LG2 and LG3 of agrin and in the LG modules of neurexins ZGesemann et al., 1996; Rudenko et al., 1999.. Structural and functional studies were initially performed with the proteolytic laminin-1 fragments E3 Z 1LG4 5. and E8, the latter consisting of 1LG1 3 connected to part of the coiled coil rod forming the

long arm of laminin ZOtt et al., 1982; Bruch et al., 1989; Beck et al., 1990.. The LG modules were shown to have a globular fold and a high content of structure. Electron microcopy of negatively stained samples revealed a unique topological arrangement of the five LG modules within the G domain of laminin-1 ZFig. 2.. More recent studies were based on recombinant laminin LG modules obtained as single modules or tandems from mammalian and insect cells ZSung et al., 1993; Yurchenco et al., 1993; Rambukkana et al., 1997; Talts et al., 1998; Andac et al., 1999.. Their proper folding depended critically on the correct choice of module boundaries ZTalts et al., 1998; Andac et al., 1999., which now can be predicted from sequence alignments Zsee below.. Folding may also be affected by the presence of proteolytic processing sites, as shown for a basic sequence within the 2LG3 module ZTalts and Timpl, 1999.. The availability of properly folded recombinant fragments has finally made possible detailed structural and mutational studies.

3. Crystal structures of laminin LG modules The first crystal structures of laminin LG modules were reported recently. Hohenester et al. Z1999. solved the structure of 2LG5, quickly followed by the structure of the 2LG4 5 tandem ZTisi et al., 2000.. In a remarkable coincidence, the structures of a neurexin LG module ZRudenko et al., 1999. and of the steroid-binding LG module of sex hormone-binding globulin ZGrishkovskaya et al., 2000. also became available recently. The LG module is constructed from 14 strands arranged in two sheets ZFig. 3.. The resulting sandwich including the loop structures is of roughly sperical shape with a diameter of approximately 3.5 nm. As predicted ZBeckmann et al., 1998.,

the LG module fold is related to the jelly roll fold observed in the pentraxins and many other lectins ZHohenester et al., 1999; Rudenko et al., 1999.. The N- and C-termini of the LG module are in close proximity, posing an interesting problem for the higher architecture of LG tandems. In all but one LG modules of laminin, agrin and perlecan the C-terminus is anchored to the strand L by a conserved disulfide bridge Zthe single exception is agrin LG2.. One edge of the 2LG5 sandwich binds a calcium ion with two aspartic acid side chains and two main chain carbonyls. The calcium ligands are conserved in other LG modules from the laminin 1 and 2 chains, perlecan and agrin ZHohenester et al., 1999.. All these proteins bind calcium dependently to identical or overlapping sites on the cellular receptor -dystroglycan Zsee below. and it has been proposed that a direct interaction between the calcium ion and the anionic O-linked glycan of -dystroglycan may

account for the calcium dependence ZHohenester et al., 1999.. From sequence comparison the laminin 3, 4 and 5 chains are predicted not to have calcium sites analogous to that of 2LG5 ZFig. 4.. The edge of the sandwich binding the calcium ion contains many of the basic residues involved in heparin and sulfatide binding by laminins Zsee below., as well as the splice sites modulating the biological activities of LG modules in agrin and the neurexins ZHohenester et al., 1999; Rudenko et al., 1999.. The steroid binding site of sex hormone-binding globulin is also located in this region ZGrishkovskaya et al., 2000.. Hence, the LG module structure appears to contain a preferential site for interacting with an array of ligands, which is positioned appropriately opposite the domain boundaries. The invariant location of ligand binding sites on one edge of the sandwich distinguishes the LG module family from their more distant relatives with a jellyroll fold, such

as the pentraxins and lectins, which bind ligands near the centre of the concave sheet ZHohenester et al., 1999; Rudenko et al., 1999; Grishkovskaya et al., 2000.. The structure of the 2LG4 5 tandem ZTisi et al., 2000. revealed the mode of association of adjacent modules in LG tandems ZFig. 3.. The two LG modules are related by a pure rotation of approximately 110 about an axis passing near the domain boundaries and interact through an interface of approximately ° 450 A2 . A surprising feature of the 2LG4 5 structure is that a significant part of the LG3 LG4 linker is integrated into the LG tandem and forms an interdomain disulfide bridge to LG5, which is conserved in chains. Opposite the domain bounall laminin daries, the 2LG4 5 structure contains a 6.5-nm wide shallow depression bearing many basic residues. The calcium sites of LG4 and LG5 are located at the periphery of this region, which is suggested to be the site of -dystroglycan binding ZTisi et al., 2000.. A hypothetical model of the entire laminin G domain was constructed based on the 2LG4 5 structure and the known lengths of interdomain linkers ZTisi et al., 2000.. The model predicts that the LG1 3 portion has the shape of a cloverleaf, with the LG

modules related by 120 rotations ZFig. 3.. The rod domain of laminin is predicted to make contacts with LG1 3, but the relative orientation of rod and LG1 3 cannot be predicted. The unusual path of the LG3 LG4 linker results in LG5 being closer to the LG1 3 cloverleaf than LG4. Due to the length of the LG3 LG4 linker ZFig. 5. the distal LG4 5 tandem is likely to assume a wide range of conformations relative to LG1 3. All these features of the model are in good agreement with the electron micrographs of laminin-1 shown in Fig. 2.

4. Binding to heparin, sulfatides and proteins Fragment E3 Z 1LG4 5. was previously shown to contain a major heparin-binding site of laminin-1 ZOtt et al., 1982. and a related fragment binds to sulfatides ZTaraboletti et al., 1990.. Both binding activities may assist in laminin receptor interactions by allowing sulfate groups at or near the cell surface to be used as co-receptors. They also allow for interactions with extracellular heparan sulfate of perlecan ZSasaki et al., 1998. or, in the case of sulfatides, may facilitate laminin polymerization into networks ZKalb and

Engel, 1991.. Analysis of recombinant fragments localized both binding epitopes exclusively to the 1LG4 module ZAndac et al., 1999.. Site-directed mutagenesis identified two basic clusters in loops HrI and FrG of 1LG4 as being responsible for the binding of heparin and sulfatides, while other basic regions make only negligible contributions ZTable 1, Fig. 3.. This indicates the presence of a spatially confined binding epitope in close vicinity to the calcium ion bound to 1LG4 ZHohenester et al., 1999.. Similar studies with the recombinant G domain of the laminin 2 chain demonstrated a distinct binding of heparinrsulfatides to 2LG3 and 2LG5, whereas all other modules exhibited low or no binding ZTalts et al., 1999.. Interestingly, the binding activities were enhanced in the tandems 2LG1 3 and 2LG4 5, indicating a considerable degree of cooperation of LG modules in ligand binding. Four lysines located in loops HrI and LrM of 2LG5 were shown to participate in heparinrsulfatide binding to different extents ZHohenester et al., 1999.. Together the data indicate, as in 1LG4, an overlap between the heparin and sulfatide binding epitopes on 2LG5 near the site of calcium ligation. Compared to the laminin 1 chain, however, there is a clear difference in the moduleZs. involved in ligand binding, as well as in the exact spatial arrangement of binding epitopes. The laminin tandems 2LG1 3 and 2LG4 5 not only bind to sulfated carbohydrates but also to extracellular proteins, such as fibulin-1, fibulin-2 and nidogen-2, with Kd values in the range of 13 150 nM ZTalts et al., 1999.. Fibulin-1 was also shown to bind the laminin-1 fragment E3 ZPan et al., 1993.. Since all three ligands are typical basement membrane proteins, such interactions have the potential to contribute to the supramolecular organization of these matrices. Only little information is available on the binding properties of LG modules from laminin 3, 4 and 5 chains. Preliminary data indicate that 3LG4 5, 4LG1 3 and 4LG4 5 bind to heparin, sulfatides and the fibulins ZJ.F. Talts, R. Falkenstein, R. Timpl, unpublished data. indicating a significant functional overlap in the laminin family. The details of these activities still need to be established.

5. Binding to cellular receptors Laminins are known to mediate integrin-dependent cell adhesion and spreading. Several studies with laminin-1 fragment E8 showed binding to 3 1, 6 1, 6 4, 7 1 and 9 1 integrins ZAumailley et al., 1996., implicating the LG1 3 tandem in this process. However, cell adhesion mediated by 6 1 integrin and the stimulation of neurite outgrowth did not only require a natively folded LG1 3 tandem but also an

interaction of LG1 3 with the adjacent rod domain ZDeutzmann et al., 1990.. These observations were confirmed in a recombinant study which also demonstrated cryptic cell and heparin binding sites in 1LG1 3 ZSung et al., 1993.. These data are consistent with our model of LG1 5 predicting a close contact of 1LG1 3 with the rod domain. In contrast, the 2LG1 3 tandem lacking any rod structure was a strong cell adhesive substrate and appears to bind to 3 1 and 6 1 integrins, as indicated from antibody inhibition experiments. No activity could be detected for individual laminin 2 chain LG modules or for 2LG4 5, demonstrating a requirement for LG1 LG3 to be present in tandem ZTalts and Timpl, 1999.. Several short synthetic peptides from 1LG1 5 have been previously shown to mediate 6 1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion ZNomizu et al., 1995.. Two of these peptides ZAG-10, AG-32. correspond to strands H of 1LG1 and 1LG2, respectively, which is difficult to reconcile with the participation of this region in the hydrophobic core of the LG domain ZHohenester et al., 1999.. Moreover, neither sequence seems to bind to 6 1 integrin when present in a recombinant 1LG1 5 tandem ZSung et al., 1993.. Another major and ubiquitous receptor for laminin is -dystroglycan, which provides, via the transmembrane protein -dystroglycan, a connection to the cytoskeleton. -Dystroglycan was shown to bind to laminin-1 fragment E3, laminin-2, perlecan and agrin ZHenry and Campbell, 1999.. The structure function relationship of this interaction has recently been characterized in greater detail than is available for the integrins. Binding of -dystroglycan to laminin-1 fragment E3 requires only 1LG4 ZAndac et al., 1999.. Mapping of the binding site by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that -dystroglycan binds to the same basic regions involved in heparinrsulfatide binding, but uses additional basic sites located in loops GrH, JrK, KrL and MrN ZTable 1.. This implies a large binding epitope of approximately 3 nm length and, since the binding is calcium-dependent, the involvement of the 1LG4-bound calcium ion in the interaction ZHohenester et al., 1999.. Even stronger -dystroglycan binding than to 1LG4 5 could be detected for the 2LG1 3 and 2LG4 5 tandems. Individual modules did not bind, except for a weak interaction of 2LG3 ZTalts et al., 1999; Talts and Timpl, 1999.. Limited site-directed mutagenesis identified several basic residues of 2LG5 to be involved in -dystroglycan binding, but there was no clear correlation to heparinrsulfatide binding ZHohenester et al., 1999.. This agrees with the observation that -dystroglycan binding to 1LG4 5, but not to 2LG1 3 and 2LG4 5, could be inhibited by heparin ZTalts et al., 1999. and confirmed previous studies based on the corresponding laminins.

The observation that only tandems of laminin 2 chain LG modules bind -dystroglycan efficiently suggests that the binding epitope could span up to 6.5 nm, based on the 2LG4 5 structure ZTisi et al., 2000.. LG tandems ZFig. 1. are also required for the binding to -dystroglycan of C-terminal fragments of agrin ZGesemann et al., 1996. and perlecan ZFriedrich et al., 1999.. The perlecan LG modules do not bind heparin, suggesting a unique binding epitope for dystroglycan. However, competition assays ZTalts et al., 1999. indicated that all these LG modules bind to similar structures on -dystroglycan in the following order: perlecan Zstrongest., 2LG1 3, 2LG4 5 and 1LG4 5 Zweakest.. Other laminin tandems, such as 4LG1 3 and 4LG4 5, have only marginal binding activity for -dystroglycan ZJ.F. Talts, R. Timpl, unpublished., whereas some binding was reported for laminin 5LG1 5 produced in bacteria ZShimizu et al., 1999.. This illustrates some common features, but also a considerable variability in the recognition of LG modules by the cellular receptor -dystroglycan. Laminin G domains also have distinct affinities for bacterial surface components. Mycobacterium leprae was shown to bind to laminin-2 and recombinant 2LG1 5, allowing the formation of a ternary complex with -dystroglycan ZRambukkana et al., 1997, 1998. These interactions are believed to facilitate the entry of M. leprae into Schwann cells and therefore represent an important initial step in the pathogenesis of leprosy. Bacterial binding partners include a 28-kDa mucin-like protein ZShimoji et al., 1999. and a unique glycolipid ZA. Rambukkana, personal communication.. Their specific binding to individual LG modules is currently under investigation. Another sulfated glycolipid HNK-1 involved in neural development also seems to bind to LG modules of the laminin 1 chain ZHall et al., 1995, 1997..

6. Proteolytic processing and tissue forms Several laminin LG modules can be modified by proteolysis as shown initially for the 2 chain. A single cleavage site located N-terminally adjacent to a stretch of five basic residues could be localized in the 2LG3 module between strands D and E ZTalts et al., 1998.. Mutation of a few basic residues abolished cleavage and reduced the affinity for -dystroglycan ZTalts and Timpl, 1999.. As shown for laminin-2 and -4 the resulting 80-kDa C-terminal fragment remains non-covalently associated with the rest of the G domain and can be detected by immunostaining in tissues. Several other processing sites are located in the link regions between LG3 and LG4 modules of chains ZFig. 5.. They include two sites in laminin 4, the proteolysis of which releases a fragment

4LG4 5 that can no longer be detected in tissues ZFig. 6. but persists in the cell culture medium ZT. Sasaki, R. Timpl, unpublished.. A similar cleavage occurs during the maturation of the laminin 3 chain ZBurgeson, 1996. and, using the recombinant fragment 3LG1 5, a single site could be identified in the link region ZFig. 5. ZR. Falkenstein, R. Timpl, unpublished.. A rather similar sequence is also cleaved in perlecan, releasing the C-terminal LG3 module ZFriedrich et al., 1999.. Proteolysis has so far not been reported for the 5 chain, but the presence of a furin-type cleavage site in its link region ZFig. 5. indicates this possibility. Thus it appears that, with the exception of the 1 chain, most LG domains of laminins, as well as of some related proteins, are subject to endogenous proteolysis. The consequences of this modification remain to be clarified.

7. Conclusions Recombinant production and X-ray crystallography have set the stage for a comprehensive structure function analysis of laminin LG modules. Major future undertakings will be the determination of further crystal structures to assemble a high-resolution image

of the entire G domain and the analysis of the functional consequences of calcium binding. It will also be important to map integrin and bacterial binding epitopes on LG modules and determine the poorly understood role of the rod domain. These studies are likely to reveal further complexities of laminin ligand interactions. The biological roles of laminin LG modules may only be unravelled by targeted genetic elimination of individual modules.
