Upon exposure to ROS or disulfide stress agents, Bacillus subtilis induces an oxidative stress stimulon that is controlled by OhrR (Fuangthong et al., 2001), B (Helmann et al., 2003), PerR (Herbig and Helmann, 2001), and Spx (Nakano et al., 2003). The organic hydroperoxide resistance protein regulator (OhrR), a member of the multiple antibiotic resistance regulatory (MarR) family, is the peroxide-sensing transcription factor that controls expression of the organic hydroperoxide resistance (ohr) gene by binding to ohrA promoter elements (Fuangthong et al., 2001). Ohr and OhrR are present in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and are essential for the response against lipophilic ROS by sensing the presence of and detoxifying OHPs (Lesniak et al., 2002; Mongkolsuk et al., 1998; Ochsner et al., 2001; Sukchawalit et al., 2001). Recent structural and biochemical studies on Ohr have shown that this enzyme contains alkyl hydroperoxide reductase activity and detoxifies OHP by reducing these peroxides to alcohols (Cussiol et al., 2003; Lesniak et al., 2002). Bacillus subtilis OhrR is a homodimer of 147 amino acid residues per subunit (MW w17 kDa) and belongs to the MarR family of transcription regulators (Fuangthong et al., 2001). A unique and conserved cysteine residue, Cys15, is oxidized to Cys-sulphenic acid (CysSOH) by OHPs, such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide, which results in the induction of OhrR and derepression of ohrA (Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002). Because of its high reactivity, the CysSOH may take higher oxidation states such as Cys-sulphinic acid (CysSO2H) and Cys-sulphonic acid (CysSO3H). However, the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond has not been observed in B. subtilis OhrR (Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002). By contrast, OxyR, the global regulator of the peroxide stress response in Escherichia coli, does form an internal disulfide bond between residues Cys199 and Cys208 that begins with the oxidation of Cys199 to sulphenic acid (Choi et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2004). Members of the MarR family regulate the expression of resistance genes to multiple antibiotics, organic solvents, detergents, and oxidative stress agents (Seoane and Levy, 1995; Sulavik et al., 1995). Despite low primary sequence similarity amongst MarR family proteins, less than 25% on average, the members of this family show significant structural homology. X-ray crystal structures of several proteins of the MarR family, including MarR (Alekshun et al., 2001), MexR (Lim et al., 2002), SarR (Liu et al., 2001), and SlyA-like protein (Wu et al., 2003), have revealed a common triangular shape with winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA binding motifs at two of the corners. However, superimposition of structures of several MarR family proteins highlights their conformational plasticity, as large differences are observed (Lim et al., 2002). Such plasticity likely facilitates the transitions between the DNA bound, inducer bound, and apo states of each protein. However, the lack of appropriate structures, including that of a DNA

Summary The mechanisms by which Bacillus subtilis OhrR, a member of the MarR family of transcription regulators, binds the ohrA operator and is induced by oxidation of its lone cysteine residue by organic hydroperoxides to sulphenic acid are unknown. Here, we describe the crystal structures of reduced OhrR and an OhrR-ohrA operator complex. To bind DNA, OhrR employs a chimeric winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, which is composed of extended eukaryoticlike wings, prokaryotic helix-turn-helix motifs, and helix-helix elements. The reactivity of the peroxidesensing cysteine is not modulated by proximal basic residues but largely by the positive dipole of helix 1. Induction originates from the alleviation of intersubunit steric clash between the sulphenic acid moieties of the oxidized sensor cysteines and nearby tyrosines and methionines. The structure of the OhrR-ohrA operator complex reveals the DNA binding mechanism of the entire MarR family and suggests a common inducer binding pocket. Introduction All living organisms are known to contain molecular systems that enable them to resist a variety of toxic substances and environmental stresses. Exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subtoxic levels of heavy metals invokes unique adaptive responses beyond those of general stress. Because ROS (including hydrogen peroxide [H2O2], superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and organic hydroperoxides [OHP]) can damage proteins, DNA, lipids, and membranes and potentially lead to mutations and cell death, they must be removed rapidly (Gutteridge and Halliwell, 1989; Storz and Imlay, 1999). ROS are generated as byproducts of normal aerobic metabolism and defense responses of both animals and plants (Babior, 1984). Although the detoxification of H2O2 and superoxide radical is well understood and their regulatory mechanisms reasonably well defined (reviewed in Paget and Buttner [2003], Storz and Imlay [1999]), those of organic hydroperoxides are less well known. These peroxides threaten cell

bound MarR family member, has hindered a full understanding of the DNA binding, repression, and induction mechanisms of the MarR family. Here, we describe the crystal structures of reduced OhrR and an OhrR-ohrA operator complex. The structures reveal the chimeric nature of the wHTH motif of OhrR and a two-helix DNA binding element, both of which are proposed to be utilized by the entire MarR family to bind cognate DNA. Moreover, the structures reveal unambiguously the location of the oxidant sensing cysteine and the mechanism by which the chemical reactivity of the sulphydryl group is modulated. Finally, the initial steps of the induction mechanism can be readily envisioned. Results and Discussion Structure of Reduced OhrR The structure of OhrR C15S, in which residue C15 is replaced by a serine, was solved by multiple anomalous wavelength dispersion (MAD) (Hendrickson, 1991) and refined to 2.50 Å resolution (Table 1). This mutant displays wild-type DNA binding affinity (Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002) but does not suffer from oxidation during purification and crystallization. The structure of reduced wild-type OhrR was also solved by molecular replacement, using the OhrR C15S structure as the search model, and refined to 3.40 Å resolution. The structure of the OhrR C15S is identical to that of reduced wild-type. Hence, we shall refer to OhrR C15S as reduced OhrR and describe its structure only. The asymmetric unit (ASU) of the reduced OhrR crystal contains one subunit, which forms a biologically relevant dimer with a crystallographic dyadic mate. The fold of OhrR is similar to that of all other MarR family members and consists of six  helices and three  strands with topology: 1, (residues 14­36), 2 (residues 40­51), 1 (residues 54­57), 3 (residues 58­64), 4 (residues 68­81), 2 (residues 83­88), 3 (residues 95­101), 5 (residues 102­122), and 6 (residues 130­ 143) (Figure 1). Residues 10­13 and 107­110 form single-turn 310 helices, and the nonhelical nature of residue 111 causes a discontinuity in 5. Each subunit is divided into two functional domains: the dimerization domain, which involves the N and C termini, 1, 2, 5, and 6, and buries 5033 Å2 accessible surface area; and the wHTH DNA binding domain, which consists of 1, 3, 4, 2, and 3. Helices 1 and 2 also form an interface between these well-defined functional domains. Structure of the OhrR-ohrA Operator Complex The OhrR-ohrA operator complex crystallized in two different space groups, P3121 and P21. Initially, the structure of the complex was solved by MAD methods at 3.2 Å resolution in space group P3121. Subsequently, the structure of the higher-resolution P21 crystal form was determined by molecular replacement using the P3121 structure as the search model and refined to 2.64 Å resolution (Figures 1B and 2A, Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the P3121 crystal form contains one OhrR dimer bound to a 29 base pair oligodeoxynucleotide that encompasses the -10 element and transcrip-

tion initiation site of the ohrA promoter. In addition to the OhrR-DNA complex, a third OhrR subunit was found that forms a crystallographic dimer with a neighboring subunit and makes nonspecific contacts to the phosphate backbone of the DNA. Three OhrR-ohrA operator complexes are found in the asymmetric unit of the P21 crystal form. Superimposition of all DNA bound OhrR subunits from the P3121 and P21 crystal forms, using all C atoms results in root mean square deviations (rmsd) ranging from 0.7 Å to 0.9 Å. By contrast, the superimposition of the subunits of the reduced OhrR and the DNA bound conformers reveals rmsd ranging from 1.5 Å to 1.7 Å (Figure 2B). These changes are confined primarily to local rearrangements of the wHTH motifs. In order to bind the ohrA operator, the wHTH motif of one of the subunits of the reduced OhrR dimer rotates w25°, and the tips of the wings translocate w16 Å (measured from the C atoms of E91#, where prime indicates residues from the second subunit). This rotation results in the increased distance between the N termini of the recognition helices of DNA bound OhrR but a shortening of the C termini of these helices (Figure 2B). Although the wings of OhrR reorient significantly upon DNA binding, their intersubunit tip-to-tip distances remain w67 Å. Additional superimpositions of DNA bound OhrR monomers onto those of MarR, MexR, SlyA-like protein, and SarR result in rmsds of 1.6 Å, 2.0 Å, 1.9 Å, and 1.9 Å, respectively, underscoring the similarity but inherent conformational plasticity of the MarR family (Figure 2C). Interactions between OhrR and ohrA Operator DNA In general, the DNA binding site of OhrR is B form but globally is bent w10° and undertwisted 1.4°, properties that result in the shortening of the end-to-end distance of the binding site by 3.5 Å. Significantly different features of the OhrR bound operator DNA conformation are found about the -10 region (TACAAT) and its 2-fold related sequence that include substantial widening (from 11.0 Å to 15.5 Å) and deepening (from 4.0 Å to 6.0 Å) of the major groove that result from insertion of the recognition helix (4) of the HTH motif. Moreover, the introduction of the tip of the wing into the minor groove and consequential contact from residue R94 to thymine 7 results in the local overtwisting of base pair thymine 7:adenine 24# (prime indicates bases from nontemplate DNA strand) from 34.2° in canonical B-DNA to 41°. In total, 44 residues of the OhrR dimer make 60 DNA contacts over a span of 22 nucleotides, whereby each subunit engages in nearly identical, 2-fold related interactions with the DNA (Figure 3A). The protein-DNA contact region includes the major groove of the -10 box (and its 2-fold related sequence) and indicates that OhrR, and likely MarR and MexR, represses transcription by blocking access of RNA polymerase to this promoter element. Previous mutational studies on the -10 elements of OhrR-, MarR-, and MexR-regulated promoters revealed a greater than 10-fold loss in DNA binding affinity when this region is altered (Evans et al., 2001; Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002; Lim et al., 2002; Martin and Rosner, 1995). The recognition helices of the HTH motifs of the OhrR

dimer bind two consecutive major grooves of the ohrA operator whereby the N termini of each helix points toward the floor of the major groove to make base specific contacts (Figure 2A and Figures 3A and 3B). The number of protein-DNA base contacts is fairly small. Hydrogen bonds are made between the carbonyl oxygen of G69 and N4 of cytosine 18# and between the O of S68 and N7 of adenine 10. van der Waals contacts occur between the C of G69# and O4, C4, C5, and C7 of thymine 11 as well as between the S68 O and C8 of adenine 10. The O of T72 hydrogen bonds to the adenine 9 phosphate group, and the side chains of residues K76 and R77 interact with the phosphates of thymine 11# and adenine 15#, respectively. Conserved MarR family residue D67 makes water-mediated base contacts to N6 and N7 of adenine 19#. Additional major groove contacts include those between the O of T70 and N7 of adenine 17#, O of S68# and the phosphate moiety of adenine 8#, and the side chains of Y65 and L66# and the phosphate backbones of adenine 17# and cytosine 18, respectively.

The second DNA binding element, the wing, is composed of strands 2 and 3 and their connecting loop (residues 89­94) and is quite long, extending seven base pairs (w24 Å) upstream and downstream from the 4 recognition helices (Figure 2A). A wing-DNA minor groove hydrogen bond is formed between the NH of R94 and the O2 and O4# of thymine 7 (Figure 3C). The former contact effectively discriminates against purines at this position. The minor groove position of R94 is buttressed by its electrostatic interaction with the carboxylate side chain of D92 and a phosphate contact from the guanidinium side chain of R86 of 2. Residues R94 and D92 are strongly conserved amongst MarR family proteins, and a similar pyrimidine-R94-D92 interaction network, locked into place by an R86-DNA backbone contact, will likely be found throughout the family (Figure 1A). The importance of R94 in MarR family function is underscored by mutational studies on MarR and MexR whereby substitution of this arginine with alanine or cysteine resulted in a 10-fold loss in DNA binding affinity (Alekshun et al., 2001; Saito et al.,

The secondary structure elements of OhrR and DNA bound OhrR are indicated above the sequence by arrows ( strands), solid rectangles ( helices), and hatched rectangles (310 helices).

2003). Also contributing to the DNA binding affinity of OhrR is the positive dipole originating from the N terminus of helix 3, which is aimed at the phosphate backbone of base pairs 7 and 8 (Figure 2A). Additional wingminor groove hydrogen bonds include a water-mediated interaction between the guanidinium side chain of R88 and O2 of thymine 8 and O4# of adenine 9 and a direct hydrogen bond between the main chain amide of E93 to the DNA phosphate backbone of thymine 26# (Figures 3A and 3D). Residue D92# also engages in van der Waals contacts to C5# of adenine 25 and the phosphate backbone of thymine 26. In addition to the wHTH motif, OhrR contains a third DNA binding element, a helix-helix motif (HH), which is composed helices 1 and 2 and their connecting residues (Figure 2A). Helix 1 of the HH motif crosses the pseudodyad axis to interact with the DNA. Residues Y19, K30, and T39 of this element engage in hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of adenines 17#, adenine 19, and thymine 16#, respectively, while residues R23 and K27 approach the phosphate backbone of cytosine 18. Moreover, the positive macrodipole of 2 is directed toward the DNA phosphate backbone surrounding the pseudodyad of the operator. Thus, each subunit of the OhrR dimer locks onto the ohrA operator by an extended wing, a HTH motif, and the HH interaction motif, an element that is likely common to all MarR family members. The Reactive Site and Organic Hydroperoxide Specificity The B. subtilis OhrR cysteine residue, C15, which is conserved amongst all described OhrR proteins, is oxidized to sulphenic acid by OHPs such as tert-butyl and cumene hydroperoxides (Fuangthong et al., 2001; Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002). The structure of OhrR reveals that C15 is located at the N terminus of helix

1, suggesting that, besides its role in DNA binding, the HH motif plays a key role in the peroxidation-mediated induction mechanism of OhrR. In both the reduced and DNA bound structures, the side chain of residue 15 is hydrogen bonded identically to the side chain hydroxyls of Y29# and Y40#, which are located on helices 1# and 2#, respectively, and a solvent molecule, thereby attesting to the solvent accessibility of the sensor (Figures 4A and 4B). In OhrR, unlike the oxidative stress response transcription regulators, OxyR (Choi et al., 2001) and Spx (K.J. Newberry, personal communication) no basic residues are found within 7 Å of the OhrR C15 side chain and, thus, other chemical or structural features must influence its high reactivity. The most likely candidate to explain a lower pKa of C15 is the positive macrodipole (Hol et al., 1978; Wada, 1976) of helix 1, at which C15 is located. Such positioning should effectively lower the pKa of the side chain of the sensor to allow the more facile formation of the reactive, nucleophilic thiolate at physiologically relevant pH. Indeed, determination of the pKa of a cysteine side chain that is located at the N terminus of an  helix of a model peptide and engaged in hydrogen bonding revealed a decrease from 8.83 to 7.20 (Kortemme and Creighton, 1995). Moreover, the presence of two hydrogen bond donors from the side chains of residues Y29# and Y40# would stabilize the negatively charged thiolate in the reduced form of OhrR (Figure 4A). To test our hypothesis that C15 is appropriately reactive at physiological pH, the pKa of the C15 sulphydryl group was determined using site-directed fluorescence labeling and the bimane derivative, (2-pyridyl)-dithiobimane (PDT-Bimane) (Carlsson et al., 1978; Mansoor and Farrens, 2004). Reaction between the cysteine thiolate and PDT-Bimane results in the release of pyridyl-2-thione, which can be monitored spectroscopically at 343 nm, and the T1/2 of half-maximal release (or reactivity) can be calculated (Figure 4C). From this, the T1/2 of

half-maximal release (or reactivity) over a pH range from 4.5 to 8.5 plotted against pH yields the pKa of the sulphydryl group. The pKa of OhrR resides C15 is w5.2 (Figure 4D). Thus, the N-terminally located C15 is in the thiolate form at physiological pH and should be ready to react with OHPs. In addition to their role in stabilizing the reactive site cysteine side chain, residues Y29 and Y40 enforce a steric constraint upon the OhrR reactive site such that oxidation of the C15 side chain to sulphenic acid would result in steric clash with their phenolic side chains if no compensatory conformational change occurred (Figure 5). In support of this supposition is the finding that substitution of Y29 or Y40 to the much smaller alanine results in OhrR proteins that can bind the ohrA operator but fail to derepress the ohrA gene in response to oxidative stress (S. Soonsanga, personal communication), i.e., a sulphenic acid side chain can be accommodated without steric clash. The required conformational change of Y29 or Y40 can be readily envisioned as the first domino to fall as nearby DNA contacting residues, e.g., Y19 and its 2-fold mate, must too reposition their side chains to avoid subsequent steric clash. Ultimately, the ensuing side chain conformational cascade would dislodge the DNA binding domains from the ohrA operator.

ROS are toxic and must be removed rapidly, and hence a variety of mechanisms are in place to detoxify them. The OhrR-ohrA system is induced by and detoxifies OHPs specifically. Although OhrR is able to respond to hydrogen peroxide, in B. subtilis, other enzymes such as the major vegetative catalase (KatA) and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, which respond to much lower levels of H2O2 than OhrR does, constitute the most important pathways for detoxifying H2O2 in vivo (Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002). The structure of OhrR provides a chemical rationale for the preference of organic hydroperoxides over hydrogen peroxide as the in vivo inducers. The presence of a long continuous strip of aromatic and nonpolar residues on helix 2 (Y43LALLLLW50, Figures 1 and 4B), which is not conserved amongst the MarR family but is strongly conserved amongst all OhrR proteins, provides a solvent exposed, w12 Å long hydrophobic landing pad for such lipophilic oxidants. Recent biochemical studies by the Mongkolsuk group strongly support our structural inferences. The natural product, linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LOOH), which contains an 18 carbon alkyl tail, that would span the entirety of this hydrophobic patch, induces expression of the X. campestris ohr by 80-fold through its oxidation of OhrR (Klomsiri et al., 2005). By contrast, the smaller OHP, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, in-

duces ohr expression by only 10-fold, and hydrogen peroxide does not induce at physiologically relevant concentrations. Moreover, the concentration of LOOH required to completely inhibit the binding of OhrR to operator DNA was 100-fold lower than that for tertBOOH (Klomsiri et al., 2005).

Chimeric Nature of the wHTH Motif of the MarR Family A striking feature of the wHTH motif of OhrR is its long wing. An overlay of the OhrR wHTH onto the wHTH motifs of the bacterial transcription regulators BmrR (Zheleznova et al., 1999) and CRP (Schultz et al., 1991) high-

(A) C15SOH-Y40# steric clash and (B) C15SOH-Y29# and M25# steric clash. Other possible conformations of C15SOH result in steric clash with the backbone amide group of residue F16. These observations suggest strongly that, upon oxidation by organic hydroperoxide, the formation of C15SOH in the reactive site must initiate structural changes in OhrR that alleviate steric clash and lead to dissociation from the ohrA operator site.

lights this difference as well as the structural conservation of the prokaryotic HTH motif (Figure 6). By contrast, the superimposition of the OhrR wHTH motif onto that of the eukaryotic transcription regulator RFX1 (Gajiwala et al., 2000) and histone H5 (Ramakrishnan et al., 1993) reveals differences in the lengths and orientations of the HTH motifs but remarkable similarity in the length and orientation of the wings. Although a similar extended wing has been observed in a few other bacterial proteins, such as MecI, BlaI, and ArsR/SmtB families (Cook et al., 1998; Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2004; Klomsiri et al., 2005), the DNA binding mode of their wings resembles that of their shorter winged bacterial counterparts, while that of OhrR more closely resembles those of the eukaryotic wHTH motifs. Hence, the

wHTH motif of OhrR is a structural chimera that combines the canonical HTH motif of prokaryotes and the wing of eukaryotes with a novel element, the helix-helix motif, to effect high-affinity DNA binding. A similar DNA binding mechanism is anticipated for the entire MarR family.
Experimental Procedures Protein Preparation, Crystallization, and Data Collection of Reduced OhrR Wild-type and a mutant OhrR protein, in which the peroxidant sensor residue C15, the lone cysteine of OhrR, is replaced by a serine, were overexpressed as described (Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002). This substitution allowed facile protein purification by overcoming the inherent rapid oxidation of C15. Serine 15-substituted

Structure of an OhrR-ohrA Operator Complex 139

OhrR is an excellent mimic for reduced wild-type OhrR and shows DNA binding affinity identical to wild-type but does not react with OHP (data not shown). Protein purification was modified slightly from the published method by the addition of an anion exchange chromatography step prior to heparin Sepharose column chromatography. OhrR C15S, now termed reduced OhrR, was concentrated to 40­60 mg/mL in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA and used immediately in crystallization experiments. Selenomethionine-substituted reduced OhrR was obtained utilizing the methionine inhibitory pathway and purified as above. Reduced OhrR was crystallized at room temperature using the hanging dropvapor diffusion method and reservoir solutions of 30%­33% PEG 1450, 0.1 M ammonium acetate, and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5). Crystals grew fully in 2­3 days and took space group P41212, with a = b = 55.4 Å, c = 77.2 Å. An isomorphous crystal of reduced wild-type OhrR was obtained in the same crystallization condition. Crystals were cryoprotected by a solution of 50% PEG 1450, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, and 0.2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and were flash frozen in a nitrogen cryostream. MAD and native intensity data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), beamline 8.2.1. All data were processed with MOSFLM (Leslie, 1999) and merged using SCALA as implemented in CCP4 (Table 1). Ten percent of the data was set aside for crossvalidation. Structure Determination and Refinement of Reduced OhrR The structure of reduced OhrR was solved by MAD methods (Hendrickson, 1991). Using intensity data from three wavelengths, five of the six selenium sites per OhrR monomer were located by SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). After solvent flipping (27% solvent content), as implemented in the Crystallography & NMR System Software (CNS) (Brünger et al., 1998), the map revealed clear density for  helices and bulky sides chains. After model building in O (Jones et al., 1991), simulated annealing and rounds of positional refinement (Brünger et al., 1998) and model rebuilding resulted in convergence and an Rfree of 28.3% at 3.0 Å resolution. Using EPMR (Kissinger et al., 1999), the MAD structure was used as the search model in molecular replacement trials to determine the structures of the reduced wild-type OhrR and reduced C15S OhrR proteins, at 3.4 Å and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. Refinement of the best solutions was carried out using CNS with one initial round of rigid body refinement followed by a round of simulated annealing. Subsequent rounds of positional and thermal parameter refinement were carried out for each followed by model rebuilding. The Rfree of the wild-type and reduced OhrR structures converged to 34.4% and 29.5%, respectively. An overlay of these structures resulted in an rmsd of 0.2 Å, underscoring their structural identity, including the hydrogen bond network about the reactive residue C15 (Figure 4A). The model of the higher-resolution-reduced OhrR protein has excellent stereochemistry with residue E53, the only Ramachandran outlier (Nicholls et al., 1991). The reduced OhrR structure includes residues 8­144 and 36 water molecules. Crystallization and Data Collection of the OhrR-ohrA Operator Complex Multiple oligodeoxynucleotides, containing the ohrA operator site and ranging from 15 to 31 bp, were used in crystallization trials. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained with a pseudopalindromic 29 bp operator site that encompasses the ohrA operator and contains 5#-T overhangs (Figure 3A). This crystallized sequence contained three nonconsequential substitutions to enhance the palindromic nature of the binding site. A fluorescence-polarization-based OhrR-ohrA operator binding assay revealed a Kd of 2.5 nM, which is identical to that of wild-type operator DNA (data not shown). The starting concentration of each OhrR C15S protein was 0.5 mM and mixed with DNA at molar ratios of 2:1 and 2:1.5 (protein monomer: dsDNA). Two crystal forms of the native, i.e., OhrR C15S and selenomethionine-substituted OhrR-ohrA operator complex were grown from solutions of 0.1 M sodium/citrate phosphate (pH 3.7), 0.1 mM MgCl2, and 5%­8% PEG 8000. Crystals grew in 6­8 hr but dissolved after 2­4 days. The crystals take the monoclinic space group, P21, with a = 81.9 Å, b = 81.0 Å, c = 109.3 Å, and  = 100.2° or the trigonal space group, P3121, with a = b = 80.4 Å and c = 182.0 Å. Both

forms were cryoprotected by gradually moving crystals into 0.3 M sodium/citrate phosphate (pH 3.7), 0.3 M MgCl2, and 25% PEG 8000. Both MAD and native X-ray intensity data were collected at ALS beamline 8.2.1 and processed with MOSFLM and merged using SCALA. Five percent of the structure factors was set aside for crossvalidation.

Structure Determination and Refinement The structure of the P3121 crystal form of the OhrR-DNA complex was determined by MAD methods. Using SOLVE, 14 of the 18 selenium atoms in the ASU were located. Solvent flipping (49% solvent content) revealed continuous electron density that allowed the fitting of one OhrR dimer and its bound 29 bp ohrA operator and an additional OhrR subunit. After model building in O and positional refinement, the Rfree converged to 33.6%. The structure of the P21 crystal from was then determined by molecular replacement using EPMR and the P3121 MAD-derived OhrR-29 bp complex structure as the search model. Molecular replacement revealed three independent OhrR dimer-29 bp DNA complexes per ASU. After rigid body refinement, a round of simulated annealing, multiple rounds of positional and thermal parameter refinement, and model rebuilding, the Rfree converged to 27.7% and Rwork to 21.5%. The P21 structure includes residues 9­145 of the six OhrR subunits, all 29 nucleotides of each strand of three double-stranded DNA operators, and 179 waters. The current model has excellent stereochemistry with no Ramachandran outliers (Table 1).

The Determination of the pKa of Reactive C15: Site-Direct Fluorescence Labeling by PDT-Bimane The pKa of C15 sulphydryl group was determined by its reaction with (2-pyridyl)-dithiobimane (PDT-Bimane), which releases pyridine-2-thione and absorbs at 343 nm. A stock solution of PDT-Bimane was made in DMSO, and the concentration was determined using absorbance extinction coefficient at 380 nm, 380 = 5000 M · cm-1 in ethanol (Carlsson et al., 1978; Mansoor and Farrens, 2004). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 mM PDT-Bimane (1 L) into a cuvette containing 1 ml of 12 M of wild-type OhrR in 100 mM sodium phosphate/citrate. The tested pHs ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 in 0.5 increments. The formation of the pyridine-2-thione product was monitored at 343 nm at room temperature at 15 s intervals. As a control, the same experiments were performed with the OhrR C15S protein, which assessed the relative stability of the PDTBimane to spontaneous hydrolysis. These resulting curves showed insignificant breakdown at each pH. Absorbance data were fitted directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the program KaleidaGraph and the T1/2 (the time to reach half-maximal reactivity as monitored by half-maximal release of pyridyl-2-thione) at each pH was determined. Those values were plotted against pH using sigmoidal curve fit and GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software). From this plot, the pKa of sulphydryl group at C15 was determined. All figures were made using Swiss-Pdb Viewer (Guex and Peitsch, 1997), Grasp (Nicholls et al., 1991), and O and rendered in POV-Ray (www.povray.org).
