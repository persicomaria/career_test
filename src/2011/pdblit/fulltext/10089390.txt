Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from one molecule of bicarbonate, two molecules of Mg2+ATP and one molecule of glutamine or ammonia depending upon the particular form of the enzyme under investigation. As isolated from Escherichia coli, the enzyme is an ,-heterodimer consisting of a small subunit that hydrolyzes glutamine and a large subunit that catalyzes the two required phosphorylation events. Here the threedimensional structure of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase Ê from E. coli re®ned to 2.1 A resolution with an R factor of 17.9% is described. The small subunit is distinctly bilobal with a catalytic triad (Cys269, His353 and Glu355) situated between the two structural domains. As observed in those enzymes belonging to the a-hydrolase family, the active-site nucleophile, Cys269, is perched at the top of a tight turn. The large subunit consists of four structural units: the carboxyphosphate synthetic component, the oligomerization domain, the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component and the allosteric domain. Both the carboxyphosphate and carbamoyl phosphate synthetic components bind Mn2+ADP. In the carboxyphosphate synthetic component, the two observed Mn2+ ions are both octahedrally coordinated by oxygen-containing ligands and are bridged by the carboxylate side chain of Glu299. Glu215 plays a key allosteric role by coordinating to the physiologically important potassium ion and hydrogen bonding to the ribose hydroxyl groups of ADP. In the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component, the single observed Mn2+ ion is also octahedrally coordinated by oxygen-containing ligands and Glu761 plays a similar role to that of Glu215. The carboxyphosphate and carbamoyl phosphate synthetic components, while topologically equivalent, are structurally different, as would be expected in light of their separate biochemical functions.

1. Introduction
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase from Escherichia coli, hereafter referred to as CPS, catalyzes the ®rst committed step in the separate biosynthetic pathways for the production of arginine and pyrimidine nucleotides. The heterodimeric protein is composed of a small amidotransferase subunit of molecular weight $42 kDa that is complexed to a larger synthetase subunit of molecular weight $118 kDa (Matthews & Anderson, 1972; Trotta et al., 1971). Amino-acid sequence alignments (Piette et al., 1984; Nyunoya & Lusty, 1983; Werner et al., 1985) have demonstrated that the C-terminal half of the small subunit is homologous to the trpG-type glutamine amidotransferase domains of CTP synthetase (Weng et al., 1986), GMP synthetase (Zalkin et al., 1985) and p-aminobenzoate synthetase (Kaplan & Nichols, 1983; Kaplan et al.,

1985), among others. In addition, analysis of the primary structure of the larger subunit has revealed the unexpected presence of an internal tandem repeat such that the region of polypeptide chain de®ned by Met1±Glu403 is 40% identical to that delineated by Asn554±Asn936 (Nyunoya & Lusty, 1983). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have further indicated that each of these components contains a binding site for one of the two Mg2+ ATP molecules required for the catalytic assembly of carbamoyl phosphate (Post et al., 1990). These nucleotide-binding components are homologous in both primary and tertiary structure to the catalytic domains observed in biotin carboxylase (Waldrop et al., 1994), d-alanine:d-alanine ligase (Fan et al., 1994) and glutathione synthetase (Yamaguchi et al., 1993). Chemical modi®cation and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have further identi®ed the C-terminal domain of the large subunit, de®ned by Ser937±Lys1073, as the primary binding site for the positive and negative allosteric effectors, ornithine and uridine 5H monophosphate (UMP), respectively (Cervera et al., 1996; Czerwinski et al., 1995). According to most biochemical data, CPS catalyzes the assembly of carbamoyl phosphate via a mechanism that requires at least four separate chemical reactions (Raushel et al., 1978; Raushel & Villafranca, 1979). In the initial step, the ®rst molecule of Mg2+ATP phosphorylates bicarbonate to generate the reactive intermediate, carboxyphosphate. Concurrent with this reaction, glutamine is hydrolyzed via a thioester intermediate to glutamate and ammonia (Lusty, 1992). The ®nal intermediate, namely carbamate, results from a nucleophilic attack of the ammonia on the carboxyphosphate intermediate. In the last chemical event, carbamate is phosphorylated by a second molecule of Mg2+ ATP to form carbamoyl phosphate. amidotransferase or small subunit, is positioned at the top of the large subunit and contains two structural domains de®ned by Leu1 to Leu153 and Asn154 to Lys381. The four other components are located in the large subunit and are color coded in green, yellow, blue and red for the regions de®ned by Met1±Glu403, Val404±Ala553, Asn554±Asn936 and Ser937± Lys1073, respectively. The regions de®ned by Met1±Glu403 and Asn554±Asn936 and referred to as the carboxyphosphate and carbamoyl phosphate synthetic components, respectively, are further broken down into three structural motifs, referred to as the A, B and C domains. Those regions delineated by Val404±Ala553 and Ser937±Lys1073 are referred to as the oligomerization and allosteric domains, respectively. Perhaps the most intriguing result from the initial structural investigation of CPS was the location of the three active sites, which were shown to be separated by a linear distance of Ê nearly 100 A. This fact alone dictates that the reactive and unstable intermediates formed at one active site must be channeled through the interior of the protein for reaction at the next active site without their prior release into the bulk solvent. As such, the ammonia that is generated from the hydrolysis of glutamine within the amidotransferase subunit must diffuse directly through a molecular tunnel to the site of formation of carboxyphosphate. The carbamate intermediate synthesized at this site must subsequently diffuse to the homologous synthetic component on the opposite side of the protein where it is phosphorylated by the second molecule of ATP to form carbamoyl phosphate. As expected, the carboxyphosphate and carbamoyl phosphate synthetic components are folded in a nearly identical fashion and the speci®c amino acids interacting with the bound nucleotides are similar. Moreover, in the folded conformation of the intact protein, these two homologous synthetic components, with their three structural domains, are related by a local twofold rotational axis. This observation suggests that the development of CPS activity evolved from an ancestral 2 -homodimeric precursor. In addition to describing the overall molecular architecture of CPS, our initial X-ray study (Thoden et al., 1997) also de®ned the binding sites for both the positive allosteric effector, ornithine, and the negative allosteric effector, UMP. The binding site for ornithine is located at the interface between the allosteric domain and the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component, while the binding site for UMP is located within the allosteric domain. The effect of these inhibitors or activators is primarily through the modulation of the Michaelis constant for Mg2+ATP (Braxton et al., 1992, 1996). While the initial structural investigation of CPS de®ned the overall molecular architecture of the enzyme and the location of the three active sites, the protein model was based on an `averaged' electron-density map and was not re®ned by leastsquares analysis. Consequently, many of the details regarding the solvent structure, the coordination around the metals associated with the nucleotides, the active-site geometries and the subunit:subunit interactions between the small and large subunits of the Y-heterodimer and between the Yheterodimers in the complete Y4 -tetramer were largely

The recent X-ray crystallographic investigation of CPS from Ê E. coli to 2.8 A resolution has yielded substantial progress towards understanding the manner in which the enzyme coordinates the regulated assembly of carbamoyl phosphate (Thoden et al., 1997). As shown in Fig. 1, the CPS Yheterodimer may be envisioned as containing ®ve major components. One of these components, the glutamine

unaddressed. In an effort to de®ne more fully the various structural/functional relationships in this most remarkable Ê enzyme, X-ray data have now been collected to 2.1 A resolution at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL). These data have allowed the model to be suf®ciently improved such that, for the ®rst time, many of these remaining questions can be effectively answered, as will be presented here. 1.4 M tetraethylammonium chloride, 8%(w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 250 mM KCl, 2.5 mM ornithine, 2.5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM ADP, 25 mM glutamine, 7.5%(v/v) ethylene glycol and 25 mM HEPPS (pH 7.4). They were then suspended in a thin ®lm of the cryoprotectant solution in a loop of 20 mm surgical thread. The crystals were ¯ash cooled to 123 K in a stream of nitrogen gas. At non-cryogenic temperatures, the unit-cell dimensions for these crystals were a = 154.1, b = 166.4 and c = Ê 338.4 A (space group P21 21 21 ). However, during the ¯ashcooling process, the crystals exhibited a signi®cant and nonuniform change in the crystalline lattice dimensions. Speci®Ê cally, there was a decrease in a by 10.3 to 143.8 A (À6.7%), an Ê (0.8%) and a decrease in c by increase in b by 1.3 to 167.7 A Ê 15.4 to 323.0 A (À4.6%), all of which reduced the unit-cell volume by 10%. Quite remarkably, these crystals still maintained excellent X-ray diffraction properties with low mosaic character.

2. Methods and materials
2.1. Puri®cation and crystallization procedures

Protein employed in this investigation was puri®ed as previously described (Mareya & Raushel, 1994). Crystals were grown by batch at 277 K (Thoden et al., 1995, 1997) and subsequently stabilized with a synthetic mother liquor containing 1.0 M tetraethylammonium chloride, 8%(w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM ornithine, 2.5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM ADP and 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-NH -3-propanesulfonic acid (HEPPS; pH 7.4). Glutamine, at a concentration of 25 mM, was also added to the synthetic mother liquor in an attempt to trap the glutamyl thioester intermediate known to occur at Cys269 in the small subunit. Following overnight equilibration, the crystals were rapidly transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing

Ê To assess crystal quality, partial X-ray data sets to 2.8 A resolution were initially collected with radiation from a rotating-anode X-ray generator at 123 K. Crystals demonstrating high-quality X-ray diffraction properties were subsequently stored under liquid-nitrogen conditions until X-ray data-collection time became available at SSRL. The data employed for the least-squares model re®nement described here were collected on beamline 7-1 with the MAR300 image-plate system. A lowresolution X-ray data set, consisting of 90 1 frames with the direct beam centered on the detector and a crystalto-detector distance of 420 mm, was collected ®rst. These frames were collected with a constant number of photons per frame. The detector was then translated up into its offset position, again at a crystal-to-detector distance of 420 mm. A total of 200 1 frames were collected. Typically the crystals displayed diffraction to a Ê nominal resolution of 1.8 A, but the completeness of the X-ray data Ê dropped off signi®cantly beyond 2.1 A because of a number of factors, including overlapping re¯ections and hardware limitations of the detector. The frames were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1986). From 290 Figure 1 images, 1 652 264 measurements were Ribbon representation of the CPS Y-heterodimer.

the structure reported here was necessarily solved by molecular replacement (Rossmann, 1972) with the software package AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and employing as a search model the complete Y4 -tetrameric form of CPS previously Ê determined at 2.8 A resolution (Thoden et al., 1997). Following rigid-body re®nement, the model was subjected to Ê least-squares analysis at 2.1 A resolution with the software package TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987). After 15 cycles of re®nement, the R factor decreased from 35.9 to 27.3%. With over 5800 amino-acid residues in the asymmetric unit, the goal of the model-building process was to lower the R factor as much as possible using an averaged Y-heterodimer before ®nally rebuilding the entire Y4 -tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Consequently, to expedite the re®nement and rebuilding processes, the electron densities corresponding to the four Y-heterodimers in the asymmetric unit were averaged according to the algorithm of Bricogne (1976) and one Yheterodimer was rebuilt into the averaged map. Following this rebuilding process, the entire Y4 -tetramer was reconstructed from the averaged Y-heterodimer and placed back into the unit cell. Additional cycles of least-squares re®nement decreased the R factor to 22.3%. Again, the electron-density map was averaged and the Y-heterodimer rebuilt on the basis of this map. In addition, approximately 1000 solvent molecules were positioned into the averaged electron-density map. Following this second rebuilding procedure of the Yheterodimer, the complete CPS Y4 -tetramer was reconstructed, placed back into the unit cell and re®ned. The R factor decreased to 19.1%. At this point the entire Y4 tetramer model was adjusted in the asymmetric unit and additional solvent molecules were added. Following ten more cycles of re®nement, the R factor was reduced to 17.9%. Note that non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were not applied during the least-squares re®nement. The ®nal model includes eight ADP molecules, 12 manganese ions, four ornithines, eight glutamines, nine inorganic phosphates, 33 potassium ions, 29 chloride ions, 4857 water molecules and four tetraethylammonium ions. Relevant re®nement statistics are presented in Table 2. The following side chains (located in the large subunits) were modeled as multiple conformations: Glu59, Arg130, Glu419, Asp430, Gln519, Asp521, Asp758, Arg912 and Gln967 in Y-heterodimer I; Ser29, Arg130, Arg145, Arg185, Arg343, Asp430, Arg509, Ser556, Met772, Glu951, Glu955, Gln967 and Arg1021 in Y-heterodimer II; Ser29, Glu186, Met336, Glu512, Asp518 and Lys833 in Yheterodimer III; and Arg509, Gln811, Arg1004, Asn1007 and

3. Results
3.1. The solvent structure

Perhaps one of the more remarkable aspects of the re®ned CPS model presented here is the quality of the solvent structure. Note that the X-ray data employed for the model re®nement were collected at 123 K and the CPS crystals displayed a solvent content of nearly 60%. Indeed, the number of water molecules, 4857, is an under- rather than overestimate of the solvent structure in that there are more than 5800 amino-acid residues in the asymmetric unit. The average Ê temperature factor for the water molecules is 39.9 A2. In addition to these water molecules, four tetraethylammonium ions, eight glutamines, nine inorganic phosphates, 29 chloride ions and 33 potassium ions were also located. Shown in Fig. 2(a) is an example of the electron density for one of the observed tetraethylammonium ions. The tetraethylammonium ion displayed in Fig. 2(a) is associated with Y-heterodimer I; the other three are located in similar positions in heterodimers II, III and IV. As can be seen, this ion is surrounded by rings of water molecules forming either pentagonal or hexagonal arrays. These types of arrays, which are observed for each of the four tetraethylammonium ions in the CPS asymmetric

unit, have been observed previously, for example, in the highresolution structural investigation of crambin (Teeter, 1984, 1991). In addition to these rings of water molecules, there is a Ê chloride ion also located within 5 A of the tetraethylammonium nitrogen. The electron density corresponding to this ion was originally modeled as a water molecule. However, the temperature factor dropped to an anomalously low value indicating that, in fact, the density corresponded to something more electron dense, such as a chloride ion. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the tetraethylammonium ion is wedged in a solvent cavity formed mostly by the carboxyphosphate synthetic component of the large subunit and is located within Ê approximately 12 A of the ADP molecule associated with this synthetic unit. Each of the Y-heterodimers of the complete Y4 -tetramer contains at least two large pockets of solvent occupied by over 100 water molecules.
3.2. The small subunit

For the sake of simplicity, the remainder of the discussion will refer to Y-heterodimer I in the asymmetric unit unless otherwise indicated. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the threedimensional architecture of the small subunit can be described in terms of two distinct motifs de®ned by Leu1 to Leu153 and Asn154 to Lys382 and referred to as the Nterminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. These two domains are connected by a type-II turn formed by Leu153 to Met156. The electron densities for residues Leu1, Ala381 and Lys382 were weak for all four copies of the small subunit in the asymmetric unit and hence were not included in the present model. In addition, the small subunit contains one cis-proline at position 358. The polypeptide-chain backbone atoms for each small subunit in the asymmetric unit correspond with an average root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of Ê 0.26 A. The tertiary structure of the N-terminal domain is dominated by seven -strands that fold into two layers of -sheet oriented nearly perpendicular to each other. These -strands range in length from four to ten residues. One of these layers contains four strands of anti-parallel -sheet while the other is composed of four parallel strands. The four -helices in the N-terminal domain of the CPS small subunit range in length from ®ve to 11 amino-acid residues. Connecting these -strand and helices are a number of reverse turns, including seven type-I, one type-II and one type-III. The C-terminal domain of the CPS small subunit, containing 228 amino acids, is constructed from six -helices ranging in length from four to 15 residues, ten -strands ranging in length from three to 17 residues, 13 type-I turns and one typeIII turn. While three-dimensional structural searches failed to reveal any signi®cant Figure 2 homology between the N-terminal domain (a) Shown is a portion of the electron-density map corresponding to one of the ordered of the CPS small subunit and other proteins tetraethylammonium ions.

Protein atoms, water molecules, the tetraethylammonium ion and the chloride ion are displayed as blue, lavender, green and red electron densities, respectively. (b) The that the C-terminal domain of the small tetraethylammonium ion is bound within a solvent cavity formed largely by the polypeptide subunit is highly homologous to the Nchain corresponding to the carboxyphosphate synthetic component.

transferases (Tesmer et al., 1996). A superposition of the Cterminal domain of the CPS small subunit onto the N-terminal domain of GMP synthetase is depicted in Fig. 4. In addition to the topological similarities in their three-dimensional structures, both of these enzymes contain a catalytic triad composed of a glutamate, a histidine and a cysteine residue. The positions of these residues are indicated in Fig. 4. It is clear from an electron-density map, calculated with coef®cients of the form Fo À Fc , that Cys269 in the CPS small subunit became oxidized to sulfenic acid or a similar type of moiety during the crystallization and X-ray data-collection processes. Consequently, the different orientations observed for the cysteine side chains in the CPS small subunit and GMP synthetase are most likely due to variations in the redox states of these sulfhydryl groups. As observed in GMP synthetase and in those enzymes belonging to the a-hydrolase fold (Ollis et al., 1992), the dihedral angles of the nucleophile, Cys269, lie in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (9 = 59.1 , 2 = À96.0 ). This cysteine residue resides in a so-called `nucleophile elbow' and serves as a bridge between one strand and the following -helix. Those residues located within approxiÊ mately 6 A of Cys269 S are depicted in Fig. 5. Although the carboxylate group of Ê Glu355 is approximately 7.8 A from Cys269, it is also included in the ®gure since it constitutes part of the putative catalytic triad. The region of polypeptide chain immediately following Glu355 is quite strained, with Ala356 adopting 9 and 2 angles of 60.1 and À133.5 , respectively, and Pro358 oriented in the cis conformation. The imidazole ring of His358 is Ê oriented such that N1 lies within 2.6 A of 41 42 Ê O of Glu355 and N is located at 4.0 A Figure 3  from S of Cys269. As indicated by the red The small subunit of CPS. Shown here is an -carbon trace of the small subunit.

While the crystals employed in the X-ray data collection were soaked in a solution containing glutamine, it was clear from the electron-density maps that glutamine did not bind in the small subunit active site. However, from site-directed mutagenesis experiments, it is known that His312 is important for substrate binding (Miran et al., 1991). Indeed, when this residue is replaced with an asparagine, the Km for glutamine increases signi®cantly (Miran et al., 1991). Speci®cally, the Km for glutamine in the overall reaction of CPS in the H312N mutant was found to be 20 mM and in the glutaminase reaction alone the Km was determined to be 14 mM. The Km values for the wild-type enzyme in the same study were 0.10 and 0.3 mM, respectively. Consequently, it can be speculated that the region of the active site near His312, as Figure 4 Superposition of the C-terminal domain of the CPS small subunit onto the N-terminal domain shown in Fig. 5, is important for proper of GMP synthetase. -carbon traces for GMP synthetase and the CPS small subunit are substrate positioning.

site are in progress. The subunit:subunit interactions in the CPS Y-heterodimer are quite extensive. Speci®cally there are 35 direct hydrogen bonds between protein atoms that link the large and small subunits together. In addition, there are numerous water molecules that act as bridges between the two subunits. A listing of these interactions is given in Table 3.
3.3. The large subunit

The model for the large subunit described here begins at Pro2 and ends at Lys1073 with two breaks in the polypeptide chain between Arg715 and Ala724 and Ala741 and Val750. For the sake of simplicity the large subunit will be discussed below in terms of the four structural units: the carboxyphosphate synthetic component (Met1±Glu403), the oligomerization domain (Val404±Ala553), the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component (Asn554±Asn936) and the allosteric domain (Ser937±Lys1073). There are ®ve cis-prolines in the large subunit. As described in the initial structural investigation (Thoden et al., 1997), the C atoms of the carboxyphosphate and carbamoyl phosphate synthetic components are related by a nearly exact twofold rotational axis and, indeed, the cis-prolines at positions 165 and 252 align with those at positions 711 and 797, respectively.

The A domain, Arg83 N2 3.3 Arg494 N2 Lys527 N Asp114 O1 2.9 formed by Met1 to Gly140, contains ®ve Asp114 O2 3.2 Lys527 N strands of parallel -pleated sheet ¯anked 2 Arg528 O Arg116 N 3.1 on one side by two -helices and on the Arg116 N1 3.0 Asp530 O2 Asp530 O2 Arg116 N2 3.1 other by a long -helix of 14 amino-acid 2.8 Ala534 O Arg123 N4 residues and an additional region 2 2.9 Ala534 O Arg123 N containing four type-I turns in tandem. Glu548 O41 Arg83 N4 3.3 3.0 Glu549 N Asp114 O1 These -strands and -helices are Glu550 N Asp114 O1 3.2 connected by a variety of reverse turns. 42 1 Arg120 N 2.8 Glu550 O Following the last -strand in the A Glu552 O41 Arg116 N2 3.1 Arg116 N4 2.8 Glu552 O42 domain, the polypeptide chain folds into a

rather long -helix de®ned by Ala120 to Met136. Because of the dihedral angles adopted by Asp128 (9 = À79.5 , 2 = 111.2 ), there is a decided kink in this region such that the helix axis de®ned by Ala120 to Glu 127 lies at nearly a right angle to that de®ned by Arg129 to Met136. The B domain, delineated by Ala144 to Ser209, is composed of four strands of antiparallel -sheet ¯anked on one side by two -helices of lengths 11 and 14 residues. The second and third -strands in the B domain are connected by a type-II, type-IH and type-II series of turns starting at Pro170. The cisproline at position 165 lies in a surface loop connecting the ®rst -helix of the B domain with the second strand of -sheet. From previous studies, it is known that the A, B and C motifs of the carboxyphosphate synthetic unit are similar to those observed in biotin carboxylase (Waldrop et al., 1994; Thoden et al., 1997). Interestingly, the cis-proline at position 165 in CPS is conserved in biotin carboxylase as cis-Pro155. The B and C domains are connected by a type-II turn de®ned by Leu210 to Trp213. Clearly the most complicated of the three motifs, the C domain, is dominated by an anti-parallel seven-stranded -sheet ¯anked on one side by an -helix (Asp258±Gly276) oriented diagonally across the sheet, and on the other side by

two smaller -helices (Arg306±Thr315 and Ile319±Lys325). There is a decided bulge in the second -strand of the sheet, resulting from Val231 adopting dihedral angles of 9 = À75.2 and 2 = À34.2 . In addition, there is a cis-proline at position 252 which resides in an extended loop connecting the third -strand to the ®rst -helix of the C domain. This cis-proline residue is also conserved in biotin carboxylase at position 244. Perhaps the most signi®cant improvement regarding the present CPS model, as compared with the original structure Ê solved at 2.8 A resolution, is the de®nition of the active-site geometries. From this higher-resolution X-ray study it has been possible to characterize more fully the hydrogen-bonding patterns between the nucleotides and the protein, the solvent structure within the active sites, and the coordination geometries surrounding both the manganese and the potassium ions. A cartoon depicting the major interactions between the protein and the ADP/Pi is shown in Fig. 7. The adenine ring of the ADP is hydrogen bonded to the protein via backbone atoms, namely the carbonyl O atom of Glu208 and the amide H atom of Leu210. An additional water molecule lies Ê at 3.0 A from N7 of the purine ring. Glu215 anchors both the 2H - and 3H -hydroxyl groups of the nucleotide ribose and also acts as a bridge to the potassium binding site, as indicated in Fig. 8(a). The - and phosphate moieties of the ADP interact with the guanidinium groups of Arg169 and Arg129, respectively. His243, through an imidazole nitrogen, also serves to anchor one of the -phosphoryl oxygens. The inorganic phosphate observed in the active site of the carboxyphosphate synthetic component interacts with Arg306. Interestingly, the position of this inorganic phosphate is very similar to that observed in biotin carboxylase, another enzyme whose reaction mechanism is thought to proceed through a carboxyphosphate intermediate (Waldrop et al., 1994). It can thus be speculated that this region of CPS is involved in the stabilization of the carboxyphosphate intermediate. Both manganese ions in the active site are octahedrally coordinated by oxygencontaining ligands and are bridged by the carboxylate side chain of Glu299. Speci®

cally, MnI is ligated by O41 of Gln285, O41 of Glu299, a water molecule and three phosphoryl oxygens, two from the - and -phosphate groups of the nucleotide and the third from the inorganic phosphate. The second metal, MnII, is coordinated by O1 of Asn301, O41 and O42 of Glu299, a water molecule and two phosphoryl oxygens, one contributed by the -phosphate group of the ADP and the other by the inorganic phosphate. Bond lengths between the metals and the ligands Ê range from 2.0 to 2.4 A. Note that MnCl2, rather than MgCl2, was employed in the crystallization experiments, simply because the crystals appeared to grow somewhat better in the presence of manganese. The enzyme is fully active in the presence of manganese, however. In addition to the manganese ions, there are several potassiums located in the active site. Since CPS is known to be activated by potassium (Anderson & Meister, 1966), the presence of these cations is not surprising. Of particular interest, however, is the binding site for the potassium ion shown in Fig. 8(a). In this case, the potassium ion is octahedrally coordinated by three O atoms contributed by backbone carbonyl groups (Asp238, Ala239 and Ile242) and three oxygens provided by side-chain functional groups (Asn236, Ser247 and Glu215). The bond distances between the potassium and Ê the ligands range from 2.5 to 2.8 A and the Ê potassium is located at approximately 9 A from MnI in the ADP binding site. Most likely this cation-binding pocket, which will be referred to as the `K-loop', is the physiologically relevant site that allows direct communication from the potassium to the carboxyphosphate synthetic unit active site via the carboxylate group of Glu215. Clearly, the structure of CPS solved in the absence of potassium ions would serve to de®ne more fully the structural basis of cation activation; this work is in progress. 3.3.2. The oligomerization domain (Val404±Ala553). The locations of the oligomerization domains in the CPS Y4 tetramer are shown in Fig. 9(a). Clearly the simplest of the four components of the large subunit, each oligomerization domain folds into seven -helices and two strands of anti-parallel -sheet. These secondary structural elements are punctuated by eight type-I turns, one type-IH turn and one typeIII turn. The antiparallel -strand motif of the oligomerization domain provides a substantial portion of the molecular interface formed between the small and large subunits of the Y-heterodimer. Speci®c electrostatic interactions are listed in Table 3. The subunit:subunit interface between two oligomerization domains in the CPS Y4 -tetramer is formed by the ®rst helix (Leu421±Lys429) and the loop region connecting the second and third -helices (Gly446±Ser448). Speci®c electrostatic interactions between one oligomerization Figure 6 -Carbon traces of the two synthetase components of the large subunit.

Indeed, the number of interactions is quite small, as would be expected for a molecular species that readily converts between an Y-heterodimer and an Y4 -tetramer. On the other hand, however, there are four leucine residues that form a hydrophobic pocket, as shown in Fig. 9(b), and most likely these amino acids play a signi®cant role in maintaining the proper quarternary structure of the enzyme. There are few water molecules positioned within the subunit:subunit interface. 3.3.3. The carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component From amino-acid sequence analyses (Asn554±Asn936). (Nyunoya & Lusty, 1983) it was known that the threedimensional fold of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component would most likely be topologically similar to that observed for the carboxyphosphate synthetic component. Indeed, these two units are topologically but certainly not structurally equivalent, as recently concluded by Kothe et al. (1997). For example, while the active site of the carboxyphosphate synthetic component contains an ordered phosphate molecule, there are no such ions in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. Indeed, this is in keeping with the fact that the carboxyphosphate synthetic component, but not the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component, must provide a region for stabilization of the carboxyphosphate intermediate. An -carbon trace of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component is displayed in Fig. 6(b). As can be seen in Fig. 6(b), there are two breaks in the polypeptide-chain backbone between Arg715 and Ala724 and Ala741 and Val750. These are the only breaks in the electron density for the entire Yheterodimer. Note that in the carboxyphosphate synthetic component show in Fig. 6(a), the backbone amide nitrogen of Gly175, which is part of the B domain, lies within hydrogenbonding distance of the inorganic phosphate. The lack of this ion in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component allows the B domain to pull away from the main body of the molecule. This type of conformational ¯exibility displayed by the B domains in CPS has previously been observed in biotin carboxylase (Waldrop et al., 1994). The A domain of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component, delineated by Asn554±Lys686, is topologically similar to that of the carboxyphosphate synthetic component. While both the B and C domains in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component are topologically equivalent to those observed in the carboxyphosphate synthetic unit with the same number of -strands, the reverse turns connecting these secondary structural elements differ. Also, the extended loop in the carboxyphosphate synthetic component, formed by residues Glu334 to Pro345, is missing in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic unit. A cartoon of potential electrostatic interactions between the nucleotide and the protein is displayed in Fig. 10. Two of the nitrogen atoms in the adenine ring of the nucleotide lie within hydrogen-bonding distance of O of His754 and N of Leu756. Both Gly786 and Val787, through backbone atoms, further serve to position the nucleotide in the active site. Like Glu215 in the carboxyphosphate synthetic component, Glu761 serves the same function by hydrogen bonding to both the 2H and 3H -hydroxyl groups of the ribose. Both Arg715 and His 788, through their side-chain functional groups, interact with the - and -phosphate moieties of the ADP, respectively. The sole manganese ion in the active site is surrounded in an octahedral coordination sphere by two of the phosphoryl O atoms, two water molecules, O41 of Gln829 and O42 of Glu841. Ê The metal±ligand bond lengths range from 1.9 to 2.4 A with the longer lengths occurring between the manganese ion and the ordered water molecules. In addition to the manganese, there is a potassium ion that is coordinated by O41 of Glu841, two -phosphoryl O atoms from the ADP and a water molecule. These bond Ê lengths range from 2.6 to 2.9 A. This potassium ion is located in nearly the same position as the second manganese in the carboxyphosphate synthetic component and was originally modeled as such in the early stages of the leastsquares re®nement. The bond lengths between the metal and the ligands, however, re®ned to values longer than would be expected for a manganese ion and as such this metal was subsequently included in the model as a potassium ion. Again, as observed in the carboxyphosphate synthetic component, there is a `K-loop' nearby the active site, as shown in Fig. 8(b). In this case, the potassium ion is octahedrally coordinated by ®ve oxygen ligands (the carbonyl O atoms of Glu783, Gln784 and Val787, O of Ser792 and O42 of Glu761) and one nitrogen ligand (N1 of Figure 7 His781).

the potassium ion is linked to the carbamoyl phosphate Ê synthetic unit active site and lies at 9.5 A from the manganese ion. 3.3.4. The allosteric domain (Ser937±Lys1073). An carbon trace for the allosteric domain is given in Fig. 11(a). This domain plays two distinct biochemical roles by providing both a molecular surface for interacting with a second Yheterodimer in the CPS Y4 -tetramer and binding pockets for effector molecules such as UMP and ornithine. The main core of the allosteric domain, a modi®ed `Rossmann' fold, is characterized by a ®ve-stranded parallel -sheet ¯anked on either side by two and three -helices, respectively. Each of these -helices ends in a type-I turn. There are two additional type-I turns, delineated by Lys993±Glu996 and Asp1057± Glu1060, and a ®nal -helix, formed by Val1065±Ala1070. While previous biochemical studies have suggested that inosine 5H -monophosphate (IMP) functions as an activator of CPS activity (Boettcher & Meister, 1981), recent kinetic data suggest that under some conditions IMP exerts an inhibitory effect (Braxton et al., 1992). Regardless of the actual biochemical role of IMP in modulating CPS activity, it is known, from a low-resolution structural analysis of CPS crystals soaked in IMP, that the binding site for this nucleotide is at the C-terminal end of the ®ve-stranded parallel -sheet (Thoden et al., unpublished data). In the crystals employed in this structural investigation, glutamine and inorganic phosphate are positioned in the same binding cleft as shown in Fig. 11(b). There are three speci®c interactions between glutamine and the protein such that N42 of the side-chain Ê carboxamide group lies at 3.1 A from the carbonyl O atoms of Thr1061 and O41 of the Ê carboxamide group is positioned at 3.1 A 2  from both N of Asn1015 and O of Thr1017. The inorganic phosphate is tightly bound to the protein through interactions of its phosphoryl O atoms with backbone amide H atoms (Gly976 and Thr977) and side-chain functional groups (O of Thr974, O of Thr977, N of Lys954 and N of Lys993). The subunit:subunit interface between allosteric domains in the CPS Y4 tetramer is formed primarily by the second -helix (His975±Leu981) and the third strand (Arg989±Val991) of the Rossmann fold. A close-up view of the subunit:subunit interactions between neighboring allosteric domains is depicted in Fig. 12. The molecular interface is closed off on one side by a hydrogen-bonding network formed between His95 and its symmetry-related partner, His 975*. Speci®cally N1 of His975 Ê is 2.6 A from N1 of His975*. Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between N42 of Ê His975 and O1 of Asn992* (2.8 A), and O1 42 Ê of Asn992 and N of His975* (2.7 A). As in the oligomerization domain interface, there are a number of hydrophobic residues pointing towards the middle of the channel between the two subunits and these include Figure 8 Ile979, Ile979*, Leu990 and Leu990*. The The `K-loops' associated with the two synthetase units of the CPS large subunit. The potassium ion located in the carboxyphosphate synthetic component is shown in (a). As indicated by the other side of the channel is closed off by large green sphere, this cation is surrounded by oxygen ligands in an octahedral coordination a hydrogen-bonding network formed H H sphere. Note the close proximity of the 2 - and 3 -hydroxyl groups of the ADP ribose to the between N2 of Asn987 and O of Asn987* potassium ion. The potassium ion located in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component is Ê (3.1 A), and N2 of Asn987* and O of shown in (b). Ordered water molecules are depicted as red spheres.

Ê Asn987 (2.9 A). This region is not shown in Fig. 12, simply for the sake of clarity. Like the interface formed by the oligomerization domains, the subunit:subunit contact region between allosteric domains in the CPS Y4 -tetramer is hydrophobic with only ®ve ordered water molecules located nearby. 3.3.5. The ornithine binding pocket. The ornithine binding pocket is formed by the ®fth -strand and the ®fth -helix of the allosteric domain and three -strands from the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. A close-up view of this region is displayed in Fig. 13. One of the carboxÊ ylate O atoms of ornithine lies at 2.8 A from the backbone amide N atoms of Thr1042 and a water molecule, and the Ê second is positioned at 2.8 A from O of Thr1042 and another solvent. The -amino group of ornithine forms a hydrogen bond Ê with O of Tyr1040 (2.5 A), while the amino group of the effector molecule Ê interacts with O41 of Glu783 (3.0 A), O41 of Ê ) and O of Asp791 (2.9 A). Ê Glu892 (2.5 A Ornithine acts as a bridge between the allosteric domain and the active site of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component Ê such that its -amino group is 8.7 A from the potassium ion residing in the `K-loop'.

4. Discussion
There are two undeniable facts with regard to the model of CPS presented here: (i) the carboxyphosphate and carbamoyl phosphate synthetic components, though topologically similar, are not structurally equivalent, and (ii) the three active sites of the enzyme are separated by a linear Ê distance of nearly 100 A. Indeed, the Yheterodimeric enzyme contains three distinct active sites connected to one another by two putative molecular tunnels. In addition, there are two allosteric binding sites (one for ornithine and the other for UMP or IMP) that are utilized separately for the activation or inhibition of catalytic activity through modulation of the Michaelis constant for Mg2+ATP. All of these binding sites must obviously work in concert to coordinate the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate via a chemical mechanism that is known to require ®ve substrates, four distinct chemical steps and at least three reaction intermediates. Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the molecular architecture of CPS is the pair of topologically similar synthetase components within the large subunit that contain the active sites for the two phosphorylation events. The nearly exact twofold rotational axis that relates these two synthetase components to each

in Table 3. These residues of the carboxyphosphate synthetic component, namely Asn227, Cys228, Ala253, Gln254, Thr257, Asp258, Lys259, Gln262, Arg265, Asn266, Pro290, Asn292, Asp333, Glu349, Ser351, Ile352, Arg389, Gln391 and Gln392, correspond topologically to Met772, Val773, Ala798, Tyr799, Ser802, Gln803, Glu804, Asp807, Arg810, Gln811, Asn834, Glu836, Ala875, Glu882, Ile884, Pro885, Arg922, Phe924 and Ala925 of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. As can be seen, only four of these amino acids are identical between the two synthetase components. Quite strikingly, Lys259 in the carboxyphosphate synthetic component corresponds to Glu804 in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. These observations make it highly unlikely that the small subunit ever binds productively to the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. Moreover, the small subunit forms additional hydrogen bonds with 16 other residues contributed by the oligomerization domain. Another unique structural feature of the carboxyphosphate synthetic component is a putative molecular tunnel for ammonia that leads directly from the site of the interaction with the small subunit to the binding pocket for Mg2+ATP. Examination of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component reveals that an analogous molecular tunnel is not present. Furthermore, the amino-acid residues that form the tunnel in the carboxyphosphate synthetic component are not well conserved at the homologous sites within the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic unit. Of the 23 residues that have been Ê identi®ed to be within 3.2 A of the ammonia channel, only nine of these amino acids, Ile20, Gly21, Gln22, His243, Asn283, Asn301, Arg306, Ala314 and Met378, are conserved as Ile572, Gly573, Gln574, His788, Asn827, Asn843, Arg848, Ala856 and Met911 in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. It is thus highly unlikely that the carbamoyl phosphate domain can perform the functions required of the carboxyphosphate domain and vice versa. Recent research efforts by a number of laboratories have been made to ascertain the inherent properties of the individual domains of CPS through truncation of the large subunit. Experiments in our own laboratories have failed to demonstrate any catalytic activies for either the N-terminal or C-terminal halves of the large subunit (Raushel et al., 1992). Indeed, we have shown that when as few as 14 amino acids are deleted from the C-terminal end of CPS, the rate of synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate is reduced by greater than 95% (Czerwinski et al., 1995). Furthermore, there are a number of reports on the constructions and partial characterizations of fused and truncated variants of CPS that are dif®cult to rationalize in light of the current X-ray Figure 10 crystal structure of the enzyme. For The active site for the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. A cartoon of potential example, the small and large subunits of hydrogen-bonding interactions between the ADP moiety and the protein is shown. The CPS from E. coli have been reported to be manganese ion is indicated as a brown sphere. other strongly suggests that CPS evolved from a much simpler 2 -homodimer. Duplication and fusion of an ancestral gene that coded for an enzyme capable of catalyzing an N-ligase type of reaction may have initiated the molecular events required for the evolution of this catalytic activity. This initial genetic event was eventually followed by the mutation and specialization of the two phosphorylation components and the recruitment of both an amidotransferase subunit and an additional domain for allosteric control. Clearly the two homologous carboxyphosphate and carbamoyl phosphate synthetic components evolved separately for their more specialized functions. The uniqueness of these two phosphorylation components is re¯ected in the large number of differentially conserved amino-acid residues found within each of these units. The carboxyphosphate domain must be able both to interact with the amidotransferase subunit and also to provide a path for the migration of ammonia, whereas the carbamoyl phosphate domain must act as the recipient of the signals required for the allosteric control of enzymatic activity. Moreover, each of these synthetic components interacts with the oligomerization domain in speci®c and quite different manners. Can anything be learned about these two phosphorylation components by examination of the protein structure in the vicinity of these more specialized functions? For example, how similar or distinct is the protein surface of the carboxyphosphate synthetic component, as compared with the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component, that interacts with the amidotransferase subunit? There are 19 amino acids within the carboxyphosphate synthetic unit that interact speci®cally with the small subunit, either through direct hydrogen bonds or interactions mediated via bound water molecules, as listed

been reported as catalytically active (Guy, Rotgeri & Evans, 1997; Guy, Bouvier & Evans, 1997). Two different truncated proteins composed of either residues Leu96±Asn363 (referred to as A2) or Gly658±Lys899 (referred to as B2) from the large subunit have been reported to catalyze separately the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate at rates that are approximately 16 times faster than that of the native enzyme. These `mini-proteins' are assumed to form homodimers such that each of the monomeric units is able to catalyze one of the two phosphorylation events with only ammonia as the nitrogen source. From the structure presented here, however, it is dif®cult to rationalize the manner in which these monomeric units might form homodimers since those residues known to form the intermolecular contacts between the two synthetase units in the native intact enzyme have been deleted in these mini-proteins. If, indeed, homodimeric units are formed, then most likely the intermolecular contacts are nonnative. Additional problems can also be cited with the slightly larger constructions from the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the large subunit of CPS (Guy, Bouvier & Evans, 1997; Guy, Rotgeri & Evans, 1997). It has been reported that truncated proteins containing only amino-acid residues Met1±Asn363 (referred to as A1±A2) or Gly507±Lys899 (referred to as B1±B2) are each able to form homodimers and associate with the small subunit. These proteins apparently catalyze the formation of carbamoyl phosphate with either glutamine or ammonia as the nitrogen source. Since these longer constructions have retained many of the amino acids required for the association of the N-terminal and Cterminal domains of the large subunit, the formation of homodimers is certainly feasible. However, it is not clear how the association with the small subunit is maintained. In the A1±A2 construct, 19 of the 35 amino-acid residues now known to make direct or indirect hydrogen-bond interactions with the small subunit have been deleted. Moreover, it is dif®cult to rationalize the manner in which the A1±A2 truncated protein can associate with the small subunit whereas the A2 construct cannot, since there is not a single known molecular contact between the small subunit and those residues of A1±A2 that have been eliminated to form A2 (residues Figure 11 Shown in (a) is an -carbon trace of the allosteric domain.

In the high-resolution structure reported here, however, the Cterminal carboxylate group of the small subunit is located Ê more than 60 A from the amino group of Leu13 in the large subunit. Also, Leu13 resides in a -strand with its side chain buried in a hydrophobic pocket and its -carbon positioned at Ê $24 A from the -carbon of Met1. As a consequence, a large conformational change must occur in the fused protein and it is dif®cult to rationalize how such a change is possible without leading to a serious disruption of the molecular interactions between the large and small subunits of CPS. Similar issues can be raised with regard to some of the truncated versions of the large subunit that have recently

well conserved in the C-terminal half of CPS. Even if a B1±B2 homodimer were to form and associate with the small subunit in a manner similar to that observed for the wild-type enzyme, it is still not obvious how ammonia would be directed to either of the two phosphorylation domains since there is not an analogous molecular tunnel located in the C-terminal half of the large subunit of CPS. In order for these many uncertainties to be clari®ed, the truncated and fused proteins must be puri®ed to homogeneity and fully characterized for their ability to catalyze all of the partial and full biosynthetic reactions. Prior to the structural investigation of CPS, it was unknown as to whether the enzyme contained three speci®c and spatially distinct active sites or rather a single active site whereby the bicarbonate was positioned in the center and then sequentially phosphorylated, amidated and ®nally rephosphorylated without moving. While there are still discrepancies between some of the structural and biochemical data as discussed above, one fact is that the active sites are spatially distinct and that the ammonia generated by the hydrolysis of glutamine in the small subunit must, in some manner, be transported to the ATP-binding site formed by the carboxyphosphate synthetic compoFigure 12 The subunit:subunit interface formed between two allosteric domains. Primary hydrophobic nent of the large subunit. The possibility of interactions occur between Ile979 and Leu990 and their symmetry-related partners. There is a a molecular tunnel allowing for such hydrogen-bonding network, formed by His975 and Asn992 and their symmetry-related partners, transport between the small and large His975* and Asn992*, that serves to shield Ile979 and Leu990 from the solvent. An additional subunits is especially intriguing. Both hydrogen-bonding network, formed by Asn987 and Asn987* but not shown here for clarity, closes off the other side of the subunit:subunit interface. visual inspection of the CPS model and a computational search with the software package GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991) have indicated the presence of such a tunnel, as depicted in Fig. 14. This molecular pathway was approximated visually as a series of base points, separated by Ê È several angstroms, along its path and re®ned by interpolating between these base points in steps of approximately Ê 0.25 A while also searching for the location that was farthest from any neighbouring protein atom, as described previously (Thoden et al., 1997). The molecular tunnel begins at the base of the small subunit active site where a crown of charged amino-acid side chains (Asp45, Lys202 and His353) face, towards its interior. Note that His353 constitutes Figure 13 part of the `catalytic triad' of the small A close-up view of the ornithine binding pocket. Ordered water molecules are indicated by the subunit.

From the three-dimensional model of CPS, it is known that the sites of interaction between the small subunit and the N-terminal half of the large subunit are not

Those non-reactive residues lining the molecular tunnel extending between the two active sites of the large subunit include Ile18, Val19, Ile20, Gly21, Gln22, Ala23, Met174, Gly175, Met378, Val381, Gly575, Gln829, Asn843, Thr849, Met911, Ser913 and Thr914. ApproxiÊ mately 25 water molecules lying within 2 A of the pathway have been located. Whether these water molecules remain in the tunnel during the reaction is unknown. It is informative to note that many of the residues lining the putative tunnel are absolutely conserved among 22 of 24 primary structural alignments of CPS molecules including Ile20, Gln22, Ala23, Gly175, Glu217, Ala251, Asn283, Asn301, Leu310, Ala311, Thr315, Met378, Glu577, Figure 14 Glu604, Gln829, Asn843, Arg848, Met911, A putative molecular tunnel characterizing the CPS Y-heterodimer.
