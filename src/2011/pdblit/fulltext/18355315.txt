Cone snails, a group of gastropod animals that inhabit tropical seas, are capable of producing a mixture of peptide neurotoxins, namely conotoxins, for defense and predation. Conotoxins are mainly disulfide-rich short peptides that act on different ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, or transporters in the nervous system. They exhibit highly diverse compositions, structures, and biological functions. In this work, a novel Cys-free 15-residue conopeptide from Conus marmoreus was purified and designated as conomarphin. Conomarphin is unique because of its d-configuration Phe at the third residue from the C-terminus, which was identified using HPLC by comparing native conomarphin fragments and the corresponding synthetic peptides cleaved by different proteases. Surprisingly, the cDNAencoded precursor of conomarphin was found to share the conserved signal peptide with other M-superfamily conotoxins, clearly indicating that conomarphin should belong to the M-superfamily, although conomarphin shares no homology with other six-Cys-containing M-superfamily conotoxins. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy experiments established that conomarphin adopts a well-defined structure in solution, with a tight loop in the middle of the peptide and a short 310-helix at the C-terminus. By contrast, no loop in l-Phe13-conomarphin was found, which suggests that d-Phe13 is essential for the structure of conomarphin. In conclusion, conomarphin may represent a new conotoxin family, whose biological activity remains to be identified.

Conus snails are a group of predatory mollusks living in tropical oceans all over the world. They can produce highly diversified conotoxins for predation and defense. Conotoxins are believed to number about 50 000, and could serve as a rich source of active compounds for neuroscience research and nervous system disease therapy [1]. Conotoxins are mainly disulfide bond-rich peptides of 10­40 residues. A small number of conotoxins have zero (Table 1) or only one disulfide bond. All conotoxins are classified into different families on the basis of the Cys frame1976

work in the primary sequence and their different targets [1]. It is known that each conotoxin is encoded by an individual mRNA. The original translation products of conotoxin genes are in most cases composed of a signal peptide, a propeptide, and mature conotoxins at the C-terminus. On the basis of the conserved signal peptide sequences, conotoxins of different families are grouped into several major superfamilies: A, M, O, I, T, P, L, and S [2]. For example, most of the M-superfamily conotoxins have the `-CC-C-C-CC-' pattern,

but some of them have been found to act on the Na+-channel, K+-channel, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor [3­5]. Furthermore, different disulfide bond linkages are formed with this same Cys framework [3,6,7]. The mechanisms that lead to conservation of signal peptides, particularly as compared to the sequence hyperdivergence of mature conotoxins, remain a subject for further study. Another striking feature of conotoxins is the high content of different post-translational modifications [8]. A variety of post-translational modifications have been found in conotoxins, such as C-terminal amidation, hydroxylation of Pro, Val or Lys, c-carboxylation of Glu, glycosylation of Ser or Thr, bromination of Trp, sulfation of Tyr, cyclization of N-terminal Gln, and epimerization of several different residues. It is quite rare for such a variety of post-translational modifications to take place in a defined cluster of gene products. Cone snails have probably developed a complicated but delicate machinery to carry out these modifications, which might be critical for the structure and function of conotoxins. Epimerization, namely converting an amino acid residue in a peptide chain from the l-configuration to the d-configuration, was first identified in dermophin, an opiate-like peptide from the skin of the

American frog Phyllomedusa [9]. Later, this was found in other toxins and peptides, such as the spider toxin x-agatoxin [10], C-type natriuretic peptide from the Australian platypus [11], fulicin from African giant snails [12], and contryphan from cone snails (Table 2). The first d-residue containing conotoxin, contryphan-R, was purified from Conus radiatus [13]. To date, a series of contryphans has been identified [14­17]. A group of I-superfamily conotoxins has also been found to contain a d-residue [18]. Recently, two other families of d-residue-containing conopeptides, conophan and conomap, were identified biochemically [19,20]. In comparison with other posttranslational modifications, such as C-terminal amidation, Pro hydroxylation, or Glu c-carboxylation, which exist in many conotoxin families, residue epimerization from the l-configuration to the d-configuration is relatively rare [8]. In this work, we purified a novel 15 amino acid peptide from the venom of Conus marmoreus. This peptide was found to be particularly unique because it contains no Cys residues, a hydroxylated Pro at position 10, and a d-Phe at position 13. Its cDNA sequence indicates that it belongs to the M-superfamily, albeit it shares no sequence homology with other M-superfamily conotoxins. Its solution structure, including the

effect of the d-Phe on structure, was also studied. The unusual structure of conomarphin further demonstrates the high diversity of conotoxins.

Results
Purification and primary sequence of conomarphin As previously reported, the crude venom of C. marmoreus was separated into two peaks on a gel filtration column (Fig. 1A); the second one contained mainly peptides [6]. Separation using an RP-HPLC

C-18 column provided at least 19 major peaks as well as many minor peaks from the peptide fraction (Fig. 1B). Every major peak was collected, repurified, and sequenced. The peak that eluted at 53 min corresponded to a novel 15 amino acid peptide with the sequence DWEYHAHPKONSFWT, where O is hydroxylated Pro. The Mr of the peptide, 1931.1, matched perfectly with the calculated one, 1931.05, indicating that this was the complete sequence of this peptide. This sequence shares no homology with that of any other known conotoxin. This peptide was named conomarphin, indicating that it is a Cys-free conotoxin and originated from C. marmoreus.

(B) The second peak was further separated on an HPLC C-18 column (9.4 · 250 mm) with an elution gradient of 0­10 min 100% Buffer A, 10­20 min 0­27% Buffer B, 20­25 min 27% Buffer B, 25­58 min 27­42.5% Buffer B, and 58­63 min 42.5­100% Buffer B. Buffer A is 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and Buffer B is 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% (v / v) acetonitrile. The flow rate was 2 mLÆmin)1. The peak labeled with an asterisk is conomarphin.

In order to obtain more material for structural studies, conomarphin was chemically synthesized using standard Fmoc­l-amino acids. However, to our great surprise, the synthesized peptide did not have the same retention time on a C-18 HPLC column as the natural one (supplementary Fig. S1), although the peptides have identical sequences and relative molecular masses. The only explanation for this is that natural conomarphin must have one or more d-amino acids. The strategy of protease digestion was employed to locate the d-amino acid(s) in conomarphin. As Lys9 is the only basic residue in this peptide, trypsin was first used to cleave both natural conomarphin and the synthetic peptide DWEYHAHPKONSFWT. The digestion of natural conomarphin gave the expected results: two fragments and the intact peptide with relative molecular masses identical to the corresponding calculated ones (supplementary Fig. S2A). However, for the synthetic all-l-amino acid conomarphin, trypsin cleaved at two sites, Lys9-Hyp10 and Asn11-Ser12 (Fig. 2B). The second cleavage site was unexpected, as trypsin usually only cleaves after a basic residue. Comparison between the two digestion products demonstrated that the difference between natural and synthetic conomarphin came from the C-terminal fragment ONSFWT, which had an identical relative molecular mass but a different retention time (P2 in supplementary Fig. S2A and P3 in supplementary Fig. S2B). To narrow the range of the possible position of the d-amino acid, chymotrypsin was used to digest natural conomarphin and the synthetic peptide DWEYHAHPKONSFWT. The cleaved fragments were analyzed on a C-18 HPLC column and were assigned on the basis of their relative molecular masses. The shorter C-terminal fragment SFWT of natural conomarphin and the synthetic peptide exhibited different

retention times, which indicated that one or more of the four C-terminal amino acids of natural conomarphin should be in the d-configuration (supplementary Fig. S3). As chymotrypsin cleaved the Asn11-Ser12 peptide bond of natural conomarphin, it was deduced that Ser12 of the SFWT fragment was not in the d-configuration. The C-terminal Trp14-Thr15 peptide bond could be cleaved with a large amount of chymotrypsin (data not shown), which suggested that Thr15 was an l-amino acid. Thus, the possible positions for the d-amino acid residue in conomarphin were determined to be Phe13, Trp14, or both. To check these three possibilities, four peptides were synthesized, all l-configuration SFWT, SFWT with d-Phe, SFWT with d-Trp, and SFWT with d-Phe and d-Trp. Under the same HPLC elution conditions, the retention times of SFWT and SFWT were clearly not the same as the retention time of the C-terminal tetrapeptide fragment from natural conomarphin. However, SFWT and SFWT did elute at the same time as the natural fragment (supplementary Fig. S4), which suggested that there is only one d-amino acid residue in natural conomarphin, d-Phe13 or d-Trp14. Finally, two full-length conomarphin sequences with either d-Phe13 or d-Trp14 were chemically syn-

thesized and compared to natural conomarphin. The coelution results unambiguously demonstrated that conomarphin contains d-Phe13, as the synthetic peptide with d-Phe13 but not the one with d-Trp14 coeluted with natural conomarphin (supplementary Fig. S5). cDNA structure of conomarphin The cDNA encoding conomarphin was obtained by chance when gene cloning of the M-superfamily conotoxins was carried out from C. marmoreus in our laboratory. Besides the clones for other conventional M-superfamily conotoxins with six Cys residues, one clone encoded a precursor comprising the exact conomarphin sequence at the C-terminus (Fig. 2). This was entirely unexpected, as conomarphin shares no sequence homology with other M-superfamily conotoxins. Nevertheless, the cDNA structure of conomarphin was similar to those of other conotoxin cDNAs. The cDNA-encoded precursor of conomarphin consisted of a conserved M-superfamily signal peptide of 25 residues, a proregion of 29 residues, the conomarphin mature peptide, and the two additional residues, Leu and Val, at the C-terminus, which are cleaved during maturation.

Sequence-specific resonance assignments Complete proton resonances for both conomarphin and l-Phe13-conomarphin were assigned by wellestablished methods [21], which were pioneered by Wuthrich and successfully applied to various animal conotoxins [22,23]. The spin systems were identified on the basis of both DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra. For conomarphin, 14 of the 15 spin systems were found in the `fingerprint' region of a 120 ms TOCSY spectrum (supplementary Table S1), which were verified in a relevant DQF-COSY spectrum. For l-Phe13conomarphin, sequence-specific resonance assignments (supplementary Table S2) were performed using the same strategy. The results of sequential daN(i,i + 1) connectivities found in the CaH-NH fingerprint region of the NOESY spectra for conomarphin and l-Phe13conomarphin are represented in supplementary Fig. S6A,B, respectively. The NOESY data acquired at 300 K and pH 3 for conomarphin and l-Phe13conomarphin showed a large number of NOEs, which suggested that the structures of the two peptides were sufficiently constrained for distance­geometry calculations. Structural calculation, refinement, and evaluation The NMR experimental data were converted into distance and angle constraints as usual, providing enough constraints for the structure calculation of conomarphin. The three-dimensional structure of conomarphin was determined from NMR data using the same strategy previously used for structural studies of conotoxins and their analogs [24­27]. Most NOESY crosspeaks were assigned and integrated, with concomitant cycles of structure calculations for evaluation of distance and angle constraint violations as well as assignments of additional peaks based on the preliminary structure. For conomarphin, the process study led to 172 NOE-based distance restraints, of which 105 were derived from intraresidue NOEs, 50 from sequential backbone NOEs, 14 from medium-range NOEs, and three from long-range NOEs (Table 3). Eight dihedral angle constraints were used from J coupling constants. For l-Phe13-conomarphin, 160 NOE-based distance restraints (44 sequential NOEs, 104 intraresidue NOEs, and 12 medium NOEs) and six dihedral angle constraints were used to build up the structure (Table 3). At this stage of the structure elucidation process, the cyana program was used to provide hydrogen bond information. Hydrogen­deuterium exchange-out experiments indicated the hydrogen bonds that might exist

Thus, two hydrogen bonds related to four distance constraints were Trp14(HN)­Asn11(CO) and Thr15(HN)­Ser12(CO) for conomarphin. The l-Phe13-conomarphin had the same hydrogen bonds as conomarphin. With the additional hydrogen bond distance constraints, another round of minimization was performed as previously described [22]. The simulated annealing calculations were carried out starting with 100 random structures, and the 20 final structures selected were in good agreement with the NMR experimental constraints, for which the NOE distance and torsion angle violations were smal° ler than 0.2 A and 3°, respectively.

refined for simulated annealing and restrained energy minimization [24,28], using the sander module of the amber 9.0 package. The resulting conformers contained no significant violations of any constraint with lower energy, better Ramachandran plots were chosen to represent the three-dimensional solution structure of conomarphin, and the mean structure was generated by molmol. Structural characterization and comparison The program procheck was used to analyze the family of 20 structures (Table 3). Figure 3 shows an overlay of the backbone atoms for the 20 structures of conomarphin and l-Phe13-conomarphin (Protein Data Bank codes: 2YYF and 2JQC). The overall rmsd reported for the final 20 structures was influenced by the disorder of the N-terminal residue Asp1. When Asp1 was eliminated and the molecule consisted of only residues 2­15, the mean global backbone rmsd dropped markedly. Unlike the C-terminal portion, the N-terminal portion of the molecule was poorly resolved. The three-dimensional structure of conomarphin was characterized by one compact loop of five residues from Ala6 to Hyp10 with a loop center at residue 8,

and another secondary structure region at the peptide C-terminus from residues Asn11 to Trp14 with a 310helix. The helix was supported by Oi-HNi + 3 hydrogen bonds for Asn11(CO)­Trp14(NH) and Ser12(CO)­ Thr15(NH), which were confirmed by the slow solvent exchange kinetics of the Trp14 and Thr15 amide protons. The two observed small 3JHN-Ha coupling constants for residues Asn11 and Ser12, and the dNN(i,i + 2), daN(i,i + 2) [Phe13(CaH)­Thr15(NH)] and daN(i,i + 3) NOEs in the region of residues 11­14 support the presence of a short 310-helix. Similar to conomarphin, l-Phe13-conomarphin contained a short 310-helix near its C-terminus, from Asn11 to Trp14, supported by Oi-HNi + 3 hydrogen bonds for Asn11(CO)­Trp14(HN) and Ser12(CO)­ Thr15(HN), and confirmed by the slow solvent exchange kinetics of the amide protons of Trp14 and Thr15. The observation of two small 3JHN-Ha coupling constants for residues Asn11 and Ser12 and the dNN(i,i + 2), daN(i,i + 2) [Ser12(CaH)­Trp14(NH) and Asn11(CaH)­Phe13(NH)] and daN(i,i + 3) [Asn11 (CaH)­Trp14(NH)] NOEs in the region of residues 11­14 are in agreement with the presence of a short 310-helix. A random coil rather than a compact loop in the region of residues 1­10 existed in l-Phe13-conomarphin.

Discussion
Cone snails have developed a collection of highly diversified peptide toxins over 50 million years of evolution, so even after research for more than 20 years, conotoxin classification needs to be updated. In this work, we purified a novel Cys-free 15-residue peptide containing a d-amino acid from C. marmoreus. This peptide is not homologous to any other identified conotoxin, and thus represents a new conotoxin family. C. marmoreus is a molluscivorous cone snail, the major part of whose venom consists of peptide toxins (Fig. 1). These toxins are mainly Cys-rich peptides [6], except for one Cys-free fraction having a novel sequence of DWEYHAHPKONSFWT with Pro10 hydroxylated and Phe13 in the d-conformation. Several families of Cys-free conopeptides from different cone snails have been reported (Table 1). However, this novel peptide does not exhibit obvious homology with the others, so it was designated conomarphin. It is very surprising that, on the basis of the conserved signal peptide sequence, conomarphin belongs to the M-superfamily, a major conotoxin superfamily. All of the conventional M-superfamily conotoxins have three disulfide bonds, although their disulfide linkages and targets are significantly different from each other [3­7]. Now, with conomarphin, the M-superfamily may become the most diversified conotoxin superfamily. It is interesting that conotoxin precursor signal peptides are rather conserved, whereas mature peptides are very diversified. Gene structure exploration of this conotoxin superfamily would give some hints, as has been done for the A-superfamily of conotoxins [29]. Obviously, conomarphin maturation involves several different post-translational modifications. Apart from cleavage of the signal peptide and the propeptide, which happens in the maturation process for every conotoxin [8], the removal of the two additional residues Leu and Val at the C-terminus is rather unique to conomarphin. To our knowledge, the cleavage of the C-terminal Leu and Val has not been reported previously. The enzyme responsible for this cleavage and the recognition sequence for post-translational modifications, namely hydroxylation of Pro10 and epimerization of l-Phe13 to d-Phe13, remain to be clarified. Hydroxyproline has been found in many conotoxins with or without disulfide bonds [7,20,30]. It has also been found that Pro hydroxylation happens with high specificity; that is, only one Pro residue is hydroxylated in many conotoxins. However, the physiological role of specific Pro hydroxylation in conotoxins is still elusive.

The epimerized d-Phe13 is another striking feature of conomarphin. The l-amino acid to d-amino acid epimerization in a polypeptide chain is quite rare and not well understood, although some d-amino acids have been known for a long time to act as neurotransmitters. d-Amino acid-containing peptides or toxins have been found in mollusks [12,18­20], arthropods [10], amphibians [9] and even mammals [11]. They are produced by a ribosome protein translation pathway based on their mRNAs [17,18,31], so epimerization must occur on an incorporated l-amino acid of a peptide chain. So far, epimerization enzymes have been found in frog skin [32], spider venom [33], and the venom of the Australian platypus [34], but they are completely different with respect to sequence and mechanism. Although the detailed mechanism of epimerization is unclear, epimerization in short peptides has been found to have a `position rule'; namely, epimerization occurs only at three positions: position 2 at the N-terminus (+2), and positions 3 and 5 at the C-terminus ()3 and )5) (Table 2). It is noteworthy that epimerization at each of these three positions has been found in cone snails, such as the +2 position in conomap [19], the )3 position in conomarphin and r11a [35], and the )5 position in contryphan [16]. However, epimerization happens mainly at the +2 position in other organisms. Probably, cone snails have developed a more advanced system to achieve this difficult modification at different positions. This is not surprising, because of the well-known high content of post-translational modifications in conotoxins [8]. It is noteworthy that from the single species C. marmoreus, two epimerization positions have been found, the )3 position for conomarphin and the )5 position for glacontryphan-M [16]. It is not known whether they are modified by the same enzyme system but with different recognition sequences. It is also worth pointing out that the l-amino acid to d-amino acid epimerization seems to be complete for conopeptides, whereas both isoforms coexist in defensin-like peptides and natriuretic peptides from the Australian platypus [11]. With the help of such a developed post-translational modification system, conotoxins exhibit amazing structural diversity. In this work, we found that conomarphin, despite being a short peptide of 15 residues, is well structured in solution (Fig. 3 and supplementary Fig. S7). The d-Phe13 of conomarphin has a significant effect on the structure of the peptide; a tight loop around Pro8 and a short 310-helix at the C-terminus were identified. However, for l-Phe13-conomarphin, there was no loop in the middle and the peptide chain seemed to be rather straight, whereas the C-terminal

helix was two residues longer. Superimposition of the C-terminal helices of conomarphin and l-Phe13-conomarphin showed that the relatively large side chain of l-Phe13 might cause spatial hindrance to Hyp10 and Lys9 forming a loop (Fig. 4), so that the rest of the peptide chain of l-Phe13-conomarphin extends roughly along the axis orientation of the C-terminal helix. The structures of several d-amino acid-containing peptides have been determined, including glacontryphan-M [36], contraphan-R [37], contrypan-Vn [38], DLP-2 and DLP-4 [39], and the C-terminal peptide of x-agatoxin [10]. The NMR structure of excitatory r11a was reported very recently [40]. There are one or more disulfide bonds in all of these peptides, which supports their rigid structures. Consequently, the terminal d-amino acid has only a minimal effect on the overall structure. However, in Cys-free conomarphin, d-Phe13 has a critical role in maintaining the peptide conformation. Converting d-Phe13 to l-Phe13 dramatically changes the structure (Fig. 4). It is plausible that this d-Phe13 and the well-maintained structure of conomarphin could be very important for its function, the exploration of which will certainly be of great interest. In summary, a new conotoxin family, conomarphin, was identified and structurally studied in this work. Furthermore, the critical influence of a d-amino acid on the conformation of a peptide was demonstrated. It

is noteworthy that this conotoxin family exists in all three major feeding types of cone snails. Apart from conomarphin purified from the mollusk-hunting C. marmoreus, a similar sequence was identified on the cDNA level from the worm-hunting Conus litteratus [41], and a homologous peptide was purified from the fish-hunting Conus achatinus (H. Jiang & C. X. Fan, unpublished data). The widespread occurrence of conomarphins in fish, mollusks and worm-hunting cone snails suggests that this family of peptides may have a specific function.

Experimental procedures
Materials
Specimens of C. marmoreus were collected from Sanya near the South China Sea. Sephadex G-25 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden), a ZORBAX 300SB-C18 semipreparative column was from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA), and trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile used for HPLC were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Trypsin and tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated chymotrypsin were from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). The 3¢-RACE kit and TRIzol reagent were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA), and Taq DNA polymerase and the pGEM-T Easy vector system were from Promega (Madison, WI, USA).

Purification
The purification procedure and conditions were exactly the same as previously described [6]. Briefly, the crude venom was first separated on a Sephadex G-25 column and the second peak was then applied to a ZORBAX 300SB-C18 semipreparative column (9.4 · 250 mm) connected to an HPLC instrument. The peptides were eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile.

resulting PCR products were inserted directly into the pGEM-T Easy vector for sequencing.

NMR experiments
Samples of conomarphin and l-Phe13-conomarphin for NMR studies were prepared in either 99.99% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes Lab) or 9 : 1 (v / v) H2O / D2O with 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, at pH 3 (uncorrected for the isotope effect), with a final sample concentration of approximately 2 mm. For experiments in D2O, the peptide was lyophilized and redissolved in 99.99% D2O. NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker-DRX 600 MHz spectrometer using standard pulse sequences and phase cycling at 300 K. Proton DQF-COSY [42], NOESY [43] and TOCSY spectra [44] of samples in 99.99% D2O and 90 : 10 H2O / D2O, respectively, were acquired with the transmitter set at 4.70 p.p.m. and a spectral window of 6000 Hz, as described previously [22]. Spectra were processed with topspin or xwinnmr software. Phase-shifted sine-squared window functions were applied before Fourier transformation. To identify the slow exchange of backbone amide protons, the hydrogen­deuterium exchange experiments were carried out by dissolving the lyophilized sample in D2O and recording a series of onedimensional spectra every 5 min for 1 h, and subsequently every hour for 10 h. Chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl resonance of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid as an internal standard. Complete sets of two-dimensional spectra for both samples of conomarphin and l-Phe13-conomarphin were recorded at 300 K and pH 3.

Peptide synthesis
Peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods on an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc chemistry and side-chain protection.

N-terminal sequencing and MS
N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation on an ABI model 491A Procise Protein Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A 20 pmol sample was loaded onto a glass fiber filter previously conditioned with BioBrene Plus (Applied Biosystems). All purified and synthetic peptides were analyzed in the scan type of Enhanced MS by Qtrap (Applied Biosystems). The mass spectrometer, equipped with a TurboIonSpray Source, was operated in positive ionization mode.

Protease digestion
The native and synthesized peptides were dissolved in 50 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.8) and 20 mm CaCl2 buffer to a concentration of 1 lgÆlL)1. Trypsin was added to a ratio of 1 : 20. The digestion was carried out at 25 °C for 18 h, and then quenched with 50% trifluoroacetic acid before HPLC analysis. The chymotrypsin digestion was performed in 50 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.8) and 20 mm CaCl2 buffer with the same peptide concentration and enzyme ratio. The reactions were kept at 25 °C for 18 h, and analyzed by HPLC after being quenched with 50% trifluoroacetic acid.

Restraint set generation
An initial survey of distance constraints was performed on a series of NOESY spectra acquired at mixing times of 100, 200 and 350 ms. Buildup curves were produced that demonstrated a leveling of the intensity of the NOE at mixing times greater than 200 ms. Peak picking, spin system identification and volume integration of the NOESY crosspeaks were performed with the interactive program sparky (v. 1.113). Non-stereospecifically assigned atoms were treated as pseudo-atoms and given correction distances. A set of distance restraints was generated from these data and used as input for cyana (v. 2.1). Six u dihedral angles were determined on the basis of the 3 JNHa coupling constants derived by analysis of a high-resolution one-dimensional proton spectrum of the conotoxin conomarphin. For peaks that did not show a splitting pattern, the 3JNHa value was derived from a measure of the line width at half the height of the signal. For 3JNHa values < 5.5 Hz, the u angle was constrained in the range )65 ± 25°, and for 3JNHa values > 8.0 Hz, it was constrained in the range )120 ± 40° [21,45]. Backbone

cDNA cloning
The cDNA of conomarphin was obtained unexpectedly when the cDNA cloning of M-superfamily conotoxins was performed from cDNAs reverse transcribed from total RNAs of the venom duct of C. marmoreus, as previously described [6]. The 5¢-primer corresponded to the highly conserved M-superfamily signal peptide sequence (5¢-ATGTTGAAAATGGGAGT(G / A)GTG-3¢), and the 3¢-primer was the abridged universal amplification primer devoid of the poly(dT) tail from the 3¢-RACE kit.

dihedral constraints were not applied to 3JNHa values between 5.5 and 8.0 Hz. The hydrogen bond acceptors for the slowly exchanged amide protons were identified by analysis of the preliminary calculated structures [46,47]. The hydrogen bond distance ° restraints were added as target values of 1.8­2.2 A for ° NHi­Oj bonds and 2.8­3.2 A for Ni­Oj bonds, respectively.

Structural computation and refinement
The experimentally derived distance constraints, torsion angle constraints and hydrogen bond constraints were input for the molecular modeling protocol. One hundred calculations with the program cyana were started with random polypeptide conformations, and the 20 resulting conformers with the lowest residual target function values were analyzed. The 20 structures with the lowest target functions were submitted to molecular dynamics refinement with the sander module of the amber 9 program as the starting structure [47]. The molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the parm03 force field and the GB / SA implicit solvation system [48]. The visual analysis of conomarphin was done using molmol [49] software, and the geometric qualities of the obtained structures were assessed with procheck-nmr software [50]. 7
