The structure of a complex of the anti-cholera toxin antibody TE33 Fab (fragment antibody) with the ° D-peptide vpGsqhyds was solved to 1.78 A resolution. The D-peptide was derived from the linear L-peptide epitope VPGSQHIDS by a stepwise transformation. Despite the very similar amino acid sequence--the only difference is a tyrosine residue in position 7--there are marked differences in the individual positions with respect to their contribution to the peptide overall affinity as ascertained by a complete substitutional analysis. This is reflected by the X-ray structure of the TE33 Fab/D-peptide complex where there is an inverted orientation of the D-peptide as compared with the known structure of a corresponding complex containing the epitope L-peptide, with the side chains establishing different contacts within the binding site of TE33. The D- and L-peptide affinities are comparable and the surface areas buried by complex formation are almost the same. Thus the antibody TE33 provides a typical example for polyspecific binding behavior of IgG family antibodies. Copyright # 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
The murine anti-cholera toxin antibody TE33 (IgG1, k light chain) (Anglister et al., 1988; Levy et al., 1989) recognizes a linear epitope with the sequence VEVPGSQHIDSQKKA from the toxin B subunit (Jacob et al., 1983, 1984a, 1984b; Shoham, 1993). Subsequently, it was shown that the linear epitope sequence could be reduced to a minimal sequence length of nine residues (VPGSQHIDS), binding with a KD of 1 Â 10À5 M (Kramer et al., 1998), that is, about one order of magnitude lower than the original epitope peptide (KD ¼ 8.33 Â 10À7 M (Anglister et al., 1988)) but still well within the normal range of affinities of antigens to antibodies (10À3­10À10 M (Van Regenmortel, 1998)). An X-ray structure for the original epitope peptide complexed with the TE33 Fab was published by Shoham (1993). There is also an NMR structure of the epitope peptide in a complex with TE33 where the Fab fragment was

modeled by homology (Scherf et al., 1992). In both structures the peptide adopts a b-turn in the antibody binding pocket, which includes the peptide positions Val3 to Ser6, while the remaining residues in contact with the antibody adopt an extended structure. In the crystal structure there is no electron density for the two N-terminal residues of the peptide Val1 and Glu2 nor for the C-terminal Ala15. A differentiation between the terms `cross-reactivity' and `polyspecificity' in the binding behavior of monoclonal antibodies is important if antibodies are used as analytical tools where monoclonal antibodies can react not only with the original epitope and related structures, but also with completely unrelated ones. Also for an understanding of autoantibody induction mechanisms in the genesis of autoimmune diseases where usually a molecular mimicry is discussed (Oldstone, 1998; Grogan et al., 1999; Putterman et al., 2000; Levin et al., 2002), polyspecificity has to be considered. Whereas the term cross-reactivity describes the binding of epitope-related structures in a homologous manner, and also the ability of anti-peptide antibodies to react with a protein containing the corresponding or a related peptide sequence (Marchalonis et al., 2001), polyspecificity refers to the binding of molecules completely different from the original epitope the antibody was generated against: for example, an anti-carbohydrate antibody shown to bind peptides (Valadon et al., 1996), an anti-DNA antibody found

to bind a protein (Puccetti et al., 1995), or an antibody against a linear peptide epitope binding several peptides of completely different sequence (Kramer et al., 1997). If in addition to its natural epitope an antibody binds other structurally related compounds in a competitive manner, structural information about the corresponding complexes has to be available to decide whether this interaction occurs in the sense of cross-reactivity (similar binding mode using related parts of the ligand molecule--in the case of a peptide the same or related side chains--and of the antibody binding site for the local binding interactions) or polyspecificity (different binding mode using different local binding interactions). Despite several nice reviews or previews discussing this problem (Van Regenmortel, 1998; Marchalonis et al., 2001; Mariuzza, 2006) there is frequently no clear differentiation between the terms `cross-reactivity' and `polyspecificity' in the literature and information concerning the mode of interaction in the sense of polyspecificity is sparse on a structural level. For several antibodies which recognize linear epitopes of proteins we could show that binding peptides with sequences completely different from the original peptide epitope can be found by screening large peptide libraries (Kramer et al., 1997; Otte et al., 2006). For the antibody TE33 phagedisplay libraries of linear peptides and peptides cyclized by a disulfide bridge were screened. Affinity data and binding characteristics of several non-epitope homologous L-peptide binders derived this way were described elsewhere (Otte et al., 2006). Using cellulose-bound peptide spot synthesis it was shown for the anti-p24 (HIV-1) antibody CB4-1 that a stepwise transformation between the epitope peptide and non-epitope homologous peptides is possible without complete loss of affinity during the intermediate steps ¨ (Hoffmuller et al., 2000). It was also shown previously for both the CB4-1 and anti-cholera toxin antibody TE33 that this method can be applied to a systematic transformation of the epitope L-peptide to a D-peptide (Kramer et al., 1998). Generally, D-peptide binders in competition with natural ligands may be of special value in therapeutic applications due to an enhanced stability against proteolytic degradation under physiological conditions (Guichard et al., 1994; Van Regenmortel and Muller, 1998; Kramer et al., 1998; Tugyi et al., 2005). We use the case of TE33 antibody as a model to show that there is a sufficient degree of freedom within such a transformation pathway to choose from exchange-insensitive positions the D-variants of the corresponding L-amino acids, resulting in a D-peptide showing an almost identical sequence to the epitope L-peptide: vpGsqhyds only with D-Tyr at position 7 instead of the initial L-Ile (Kramer et al., 1998). The affinity of this D-peptide to TE33, with a KD of 6 Â 10À6 M, turned out to be even somewhat higher than that of the minimal peptide epitope VPGSQHIDS (KD ¼ 1 Â 10À5 M) used to start the procedure. Nevertheless, due to the chirality problem it is to be expected that the binding mode of the D-peptide to TE33 should be different from that of the corresponding L-peptide. Thus, we determined the structure of a complex of the D-peptide vpGsqhyds with TE33 Fab to answer the question of whether the binding follows the principles of crossreactivity or polyspecificity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptide synthesis Cellulose-bound peptides were prepared by automated spot synthesis (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany; Software DIGEN, Jerini BioTools GmbH, Berlin, Germany) using Whatman 50 (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) cellulose membranes (Frank, 1992), as described previously in detail (Kramer et al., 1994, Kramer and Schneider-Mergener, 1998). The peptides for the solution phase experiments (ELISA and serum stability) were prepared according to standard Fmoc machine protocols using a multiple peptide synthesizer (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany) and analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix assisted laser desorption /ionizationtime of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Peptides potentially recognized by the antibody TE33 were N-terminally acetylated using acetanhydride and diisopropylethylamine. Antibody binding studies on cellulose membranes Membranes were blocked overnight with a blocking buffer, that is, blocking reagent (CRB, Northwich, UK) in T-TBS (Tris buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% sucrose. After washing with T-TBS, 0.1­1 mg/ml of the antibody TE33 in blocking buffer was added and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. After washing three times with T-TBS, a peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, ¨ Munchen, Germany; 1 mg/ml in blocking buffer) was applied for 2 h at room temperature. For detection, a chemiluminescence system was applied using X-ray films or the LumiImagerTM (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).

Protein purification The murine anti-cholera toxin antibody TE33 belongs to the IgG1 (k) subclass. It was purified from TE33 hybridoma cell line supernatant by affinity chromatography with Protein G Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Europe GmbH, Freiburg; Germany). The Fab fragment was prepared by proteolytic cleavage with 2.5% (w/w) papain for 3 h in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The resulting Fab fragment was separated from Fc and uncleaved antibody by chromatography with Protein A Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Europe GmbH, Freiburg; Germany) and further purified from the flow through by size exclusion chromatography on a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Europe GmbH, Freiburg; Germany) in 20 mM Tris/Cl buffer, pH 7.5, with 100 mM NaCl. The Fab fragment was stored frozen at À708C at concentrations between 2 and 5 mg/ml. Crystallization Starting from the crystallization protocol for the complex of the TE33 Fab with the epitope peptide CTP3 (Shoham,

1993), the optimal crystallization conditions for the D-peptide complex were obtained by varying salt and buffer conditions. For production of crystals the TE33 Fab solution was concentrated to approximately 18 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris/ Cl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl. The D-peptide was added in a 100-fold molar excess to the TE33 Fab. The complex of the TE33 Fab fragment with the D-peptide was crystallized in hanging drops by the vapor diffusion method at 188C. The hanging drops were prepared by mixing 1­2 ml of the protein solution with 2­4 ml of the reservoir solution containing the precipitating agents. Crystals of TE33 Fab in complex with the D-peptide were obtained when the reservoir solution contained 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and 0.35 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5). They grew as thin plates within 1 week to a maximal thickness of 60 mm. The largest crystals grew when 4 ml of the reservoir solution was mixed with 2 ml of the protein solution, and these were used for data collection.

Model building and structure refinement Crystallographic refinement was performed using CNS ¨ (Brunger et al., 1998). To create a test set which was used to calculate Rfree, 4.9% of the reflections were selected randomly. At the initial stage, the TE33 Fab model was subjected to rigid body refinement using data in the ° resolution range 23­3 A. In the subsequent steps, torsion angle molecular dynamics, simulated annealing using a slow-cooling protocol and a maximum likelihood target function, energy minimization, and B-factor refinement ° were carried out in the resolution range 23­1.78 A. In an Fo À Fc map calculated after the first round of refinement the electron density of the D-peptide was already clearly visible. The model of the D-peptide was built using O (Jones and Kjeldgaard, 1997). This program was also used to manually adjust the model after each refinement cycle. Positions of water molecules were identified with CNS and were also checked manually. With the final model, refinement converged at Rcryst ¼ 19.8% and Rfree ¼ 24.8%. Structure validation was performed with the programs PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and WHATCHECK (Hooft et al., 1996). Refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Potential hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts (Table 2) were analyzed using the program HBPLUS (McDonald and Thornton, 1994) as implemented in the program LIGPLOT (Wallace et al., 1995). All figures were created by PyMOL (DeLano, 2002).

Data collection and crystal characterization Data collection was performed at 100 K using a cryoprotectant consisting of reservoir solution containing 20% PEG 400. Crystals were characterized using X-ray laboratory facilities (MAC Science/Siemens rotating anode generator, operating at 42 kV, 60 mA; Cu anode; 300 mm MAR Research imaging-plate detector). Diffraction data were collected at beamline X13 at EMBL outstation (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). The crystal to detector distance was fixed at 140 mm. The rotation increment for each frame was 0.28 with an exposure time of 60 s. To ensure an extensive scan of reciprocal space and multiple measurements of the same reflections, data were collected by rotating the crystal twice 1008 in two perpendicular orientations. Data were processed and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) and the CCP4 program package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The space group is P21212 with unit cell dimensions ° ° ° of a ¼ 100.64 A, b ¼ 108.86 A, c ¼ 40.21 A, and a ¼ b ¼ g ¼ 908. Crystal data as well as statistics of data collection and crystallographic refinement are given in Table 1.

RESULTS
Crystallization, structure determination, and crystal packing The TE33 Fab was complexed with the 9-mer D-peptide vpGsqhyds. This complex crystallized in space group P21212 with one Fab molecule per asymmetric unit. From the crystal data a crystal volume per protein mass, Vm, of ° 2.33 A3/Da (Matthews, 1968) is calculated, corresponding to a solvent content of 46.7% (v/v). The crystals diffracted to ° 1.78 A resolution. Details of the crystal characteristics, data collection, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The three-dimensional structure of the TE33 Fab/ D-peptide complex (Figure 1A and B) was determined using the coordinates of the TE33 Fab from the crystal structure of the corresponding complex with the original epitope peptide [(Shoham, 1993); PDB entry 1TET] as a starting model and refined to a final Rcryst of 19.8% and Rfree of 24.8%. The final 2Fo À Fc-electron density map shows well-defined and continuous electron density for all residues of the antibody variable domains VL and VH, but no interpretable electron density for the loop residues 127 to 133 of the H-chain constant domain CH1.1 This is a surface loop that is also poorly ordered in other antibody structures (see e.g., Saul and Poljak (1992)). The D-peptide is well-defined in the electron density map except for the terminal residues D-Val1, D-Pro2, and D-Ser9 for which the

Structure determination of the TE33 Fab/D-peptide complex As the complex of the TE33 Fab with the epitope peptide CTP3 ([Shoham, 1993], PDB entry 1TET) crystallizes in the same space group as the D-peptide complex with similar unit cell parameters, the coordinates of the Fab in the epitope peptide complex were used as a starting model in crystallographic refinement. The structure was determined by molecular replacement methods using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and the coordinates of VL and VH domain of the anti-cholera toxin antibody as search model. After the conventional molecular replacement protocol (rotation, translation, rigid body fitting) (Collaborative ¨ Computational Project, Number 4, 1994; Brunger et al., 1998) of the TE33 Fab molecule the electron density for the D-peptide was visible.

Six cis-Pro residues are found in the Fab fragment: in the light chain at positions 8, 95 and 141, and in the heavy chain fragment at positions 147, 149, and 189. The elbow angle between the two pseudo-twofold axes relating the two variable and the two constant domains of the TE33 Fab structure is 141.58 and thus nearer the lower limit of the range of 1158­2258 commonly observed for Fab fragments (Stanfield et al., ° 2006b).

antibody recognition. A key residue within a linear peptide epitope allows only strongly conservative exchanges, or cannot be substituted by any other amino acid at all without considerable loss in affinity, thus providing information about the structural basis of a peptide/antibody interaction. This substitutional analysis can also be directly compared with a corresponding analysis performed with the epitope L-peptide VPGSQHIDS (Figure 4B and Kramer et al. (1998)). It follows from Figure 4A and B that for the D-peptide D-Ser4, D-Gln5 and D-Tyr7 are key residues critical for binding to the antibody, whereas key residues for the epitope L-peptide are Val1 to His6 and Asp8. Thus, the N-terminal residues D-Val1, D-Pro2, and Gly3 as well as D-Asp8 in the C-terminal region of the D-peptide have lost their important role as key residues if compared with the corresponding positions in the L-peptide. This is also true to some extent for D-His6, which can be substituted by the hydrophobic residues D-Phe, D-Ile, D-Leu, and D-Tyr. Remarkably, the D-Tyr7, which substitutes for Ile7 in the L-peptide, has become a new key residue. In the X-ray structure of the TE33 Fab/D-peptide complex hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals contacts between the TE33 Fab and the D-peptide were observed predominantly for the aromatic side chains of CDRs of both variable domains VL and VH, as described earlier for antibody/antigen interactions (Keitel et al., 1997). The important contacts are summarized in Table 2. In addition, a very distinct hydrogen-bonding contact is formed between ThrH52a of CDR2H and D-Gln5 (Figure 3). That the amino acid residue D-Gln5 plays an important role in the interaction between TE33 and the D-peptide is also supported by the substitutional analysis (Figures 4A) where D-Gln5 represents a typical key residue. Another key residue is D-Tyr7, which forms hydrogen-bonding contacts to the amino acid residues ArgH95 and GlyL91 of CDR3H and CDR3L, respectively. D-Tyr7 is stabilized in a hydrophobic patch consisting of TrpH100i, a part of the ArgH95 side chain and TyrL32, which is oriented such that p-stacking between the aromatic

side chains results. Hydrogen bonds of D-Ser4 Og with D-Asp8 and D-His6, contributing to the intra-molecular stabilization of the D-peptide conformation, as well as with the SerH96 carbonyl oxygen also cause D-Ser4 to be a key residue for binding. The other amino acid residues D-Val1, D-Pro2, Gly3, and D-Ser9 do not form important contacts in the complex, which is again obvious from substitutional analysis (Figure 4A). Thus, the light chains CDR1L, 2L, and all three heavy chain CDRs are involved in the antigen recognition. Interestingly, a systematic length analysis given in Figure 4A and B shows that for both the initial L-peptide and the D-peptide terminal residues with no important contacts to the antibody binding site can only be partially omitted without significant loss in affinity. In the case of the D-peptide (Figure 4A) D-Val1 and D-Pro2 can be omitted, but not Gly3 and also not D-Asp8 and D-Ser9. With the initial L-peptide the C-terminal Ser9 should be of low importance, but omitting this residue clearly results in a sharp drop in affinity (Figure 4B). The current model includes 276 water molecules, 3 of which interact exclusively with the D-peptide, and another 5 with both the D-peptide and the antibody binding site (Table 2).

pathway initially ended up with the sequence dwGsqhydp, but the residues D-Asp1, D-Trp2, Gly3, D-Asp8, and D-Pro9 were now completely exchange-insensitive. It was thus possible to substitute D-Asp1 for D-Val, D-Trp2 for D-Pro, and D-Pro9 for D-Ser without significant loss in affinity (dwGsqhydp: KD ¼ 4 Â 10À6 M; vpGsqhyds: KD ¼ 6 Â 10À6 M), with only one remaining difference in position 7 where Ile was substituted by D-Tyr (Kramer et al., 1998). Nevertheless, a comparison of the substitutional analysis for the L- and the corresponding D-peptide (Figure 4B and A) already suggests a different pattern of interactions: whereas the completely exchangeable position 7 of the L-peptide (Figure 4B) turns into a key position in the D-peptide (Figure 4A), the positions 1, 2, 3, and 8 of the L-peptide become much less important for the interaction with the antibody in the D-peptide. A comparison of our X-ray structure of the TE33 Fab/ D-peptide complex with that of TE33 Fab in a complex with the longer original epitope peptide VEVPGSQHIDSQKKA (Shoham (1993); PDB entry 1TET) with visible electron density for the sequence VPGSQHIDSQKK reveals that compared to the L-peptide (Figure 2C) the D-peptide is bound to the antibody's binding site at a similar position but in an inversed orientation (Figure 2B), involving different contacts (Figure 2A, Table 3). Further comparison with the published NMR model structure of the epitope peptide

DISCUSSION
Whereas there are many examples in the literature for structures of antibody complexes with variants of their antigen (Arevalo et al., 1994; Pokkuluri et al., 1994; Keitel et al., 1997; Trinh et al., 1997; Hahn et al., 2001; James et al., 2003; Nguyen et al., 2003; Johannessen et al., 2005; Stanfield et al., 2006a; Igonet et al., 2007), where the interaction can be discussed in terms of cross-reactivity, examples for true polyspecific binding behavior of affinity-maturated antibodies with the corresponding structures available are sparse (Keitel et al., 1997; James et al., 2003; Schuermann et al., 2004). Previously, we showed for a murine anti-p24 (HIV-1) antibody recognizing a linear epitope that it is possible to find sequentially unrelated peptides (including a D-peptide) that bind in a structurally completely different manner (Keitel et al., 1997). James et al. (2003) describe structures of an anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl hapten IgE in complex with several unrelated haptens which bind in an analogous cross-reactive manner, but also with a thioredoxin-supported peptide sequence selected from a library where polyspecific binding behavior is observed. Another example of polyspecific binding behavior is the structure of an anti-ssDNA Fab in complex with HEPES in the ssDNA binding cleft of the antibody (Schuermann et al., 2004). In the case of the murine IgG1 (k) subclass anti-cholera toxin antibody TE33, the binding D-peptide sequence vpGsqhyds, obtained by sequential L-amino acid to D-amino acid exchanges based on complete substitutional analyses (Kramer et al., 1998), shows striking similarity to the initial L-peptide sequence (VPGSQHIDS). This is partially due to the fact that in all cases where an L-amino acid position allowed several D-amino acid substitutions without significant loss in affinity, the one chosen was that corresponding to the initial L-amino acid. The sequential substitution

(Scherf et al., 1992) is not possible because the coordinates are not deposited in the protein data bank. But Shoham (1993) reports that there are only minor differences between the conformations of the epitope peptides derived from NMR and X-ray data. The detailed inspection of the X-ray structures of the TE33 Fab in complex with the L-peptide and D-peptide reveals further that in spite of the inversed orientation the D-peptide uses the same central anchoring point in a way that the side chains of Gln7 (the L-peptide in the complex structure is N-terminally two residues longer) and D-Gln5 superimpose well (Figures 2A and 5). This is especially true for the side chain amide groups and the positions of the Cg atoms. As a result both glutamine side chains establish two identical hydrogen bonds each to ThrH52a and one to a water molecule positionally conserved in both structures. This water molecule is located at the interface between the antibody and the peptide and is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds to the CDR1H. This may explain why Gln7 and D-Gln5 remain important key residues in the corresponding substitutional analyses (Figure 4A and B). Also the positions of the Ser6/D-Ser4 Og atoms remain almost constant (Figure 5), leading to internal hydrogen bridges to His/ D-His NH group in the peptides. This may be the main reason why both Ser and D-Ser at the specified positions are key residues: they each stabilize a favorable peptide conformation. Another possible H-bond established between D-Ser4 Og and the SerH96 carbonyl oxygen is not conserved in the L-peptide due to the different geometry of the OH group. Of special interest is certainly position 7 (corresponding to position 9 in the L-peptide), the only one where an analogous substitution of Ile to D-Ile is not accepted without loss in affinity. Obviously, the p-stacking of D-Tyr7 with TyrL32 contributes markedly to the overall affinity and much more than the possible hydrophobic interaction by a considerably smaller D-Ile side chain. The complete loss in selectivity for the first three positions in the D-peptide may

Superposition of the D-peptide (light gray) with the amino acid sequence vpGsqhyds and the epitope L-peptide CTP3 (dark gray) with the X-ray structure sequence VPGSQHIDSQKK (PDB entry 1TET), both in the antibody-bound conformation. Only the side chain amide groups and the positions of the Cg atoms of Gln7 in the CTP3 and D-Gln5 of D-peptide superimpose almost perfectly, establishing similar contacts to the antibody binding site in both complexes (Table 2). The positions of the Ser6/D-Ser4 Og atoms remain almost constant, leading to internal hydrogen bridges to His/D-His NH group in the peptides (Table 2). This figure is available in colour online at www.interscience.wiley.com/journal/jmr

be due to the fact that these residues are largely exposed to the solvent. It may only be speculated which of the consecutive substitutions primarily leads to the change in peptide orientation within the antibody binding cleft. From the complete substitutional analyses of each step it can be seen (Kramer et al., 1998) that after the substitution of Asp8 by D-Asp in step 4 the overall pattern suddenly changes. Obviously at this point only some hydrophobic interactions make binding contributions, with D-Tyr at position 7 already being important. An attempt was also made earlier to predict the binding mode of both the D-peptides dwGsqhydp (Kramer et al., 1998) and vpGsqhyds (Stigler et al., 1999) to the TE33 Fab by computer-assisted modeling using a soft docking algorithm, but this method failed to predict the correct orientation. A comparison of the Fab structures in the complex with the original epitope peptide (Shoham, 1993) and in the present D-peptide complex reveals that there are only minor differences in the backbone and side chain positions. Those differences observed for the CDRs may be due to the different peptide binding modes. Unfortunately, for TE33 no structural data of the free Fab fragment are currently available for comparison. Nevertheless, there seems to be no exceptionally high flexibility of the antibody binding site as occasionally discussed to explain the promiscuity in antibody binding behavior (James et al., 2003; Goel et al., 2004; Sethi et al., 2006). Mariuzza (2006) suggested three mechanisms for polyspecific (multispecific) binding behavior: induced fit (requiring flexibility of the binding region), rigid adaption, and differential ligand positioning, that is more or less independent binding sites for different ligands. For the antibody TE33, the case of cross-reactivity is certainly observed if the binding of the original epitope peptide CTP3 (with a core region consisting of the six key residues VPGSQH and a minimum epitope length of nine residues) and the recognition of complete cholera toxin A (Anglister et al., 1988) are taken into account, despite the fact that the corresponding conformation of that core sequence in the native toxin (Zhang et al. (1995); see the structure PDB entry 1XTC) is different.2 This loop, which is exposed in the toxin structure, most likely maintains enough flexibility to fit in the antibody binding cleft in a similar manner to the free peptide. Polyspecificity of this antibody is likewise observed with both sequence-unrelated linear and cyclic peptides selected from a peptide library by phage display--with core regions consisting of 10 residues in the case of a linear peptide and seven residues in the case of a cyclic peptide (Otte et al., 2006) and with D-peptides obtained by systematic substitutions of all positions in an epitope-derived L-peptide-- with a core region of six residues (Kramer et al., 1998). Thus, the anti-cholera toxin antibody TE33 represents another example of polyspecific binding behavior in the affinity-maturated IgG class of antibodies3 which underlines that this behavior is not limited to germline-related
2 This holds also true for the antibody-bound D-peptide if the corresponding Ca positions are compared. 3 There are five substitutions within the VL domain and four substitutions within the VH domain of MAB TE33 as compared with the putative germline genes (data not shown).

antibodies of early immune response where this binding promiscuity may help to expand the possibilities of antigen recognition by the limited repertoire of antibody variable domains (Sethi et al., 2006). In fact, in their review of antibody specificity and promiscuity Marchalonis et al. (2001) point out that there is not necessarily a correlation between affinity and specificity.

the observation that despite a generally highly specific antigen/antibody recognition there is enough degree of freedom both in an antibody binding site as well as in the conformational space of relatively short peptides to allow different binding modes at the same site.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, it can be shown by a structural analysis of an antibody in complex with a D-peptide that there is polyspecific binding behavior if compared with the corresponding L-peptide epitope complex, even with a sequence very similar for both peptides. This corroborates
