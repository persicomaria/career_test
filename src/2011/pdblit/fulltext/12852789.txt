KSI (ketosteroid isomerase) from Comamonas testosteroni is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyses the allylic isomerization of 5 -3-ketosteroids to their conjugated 4 -isomers at a reaction rate equivalent to the diffusion-controlled limit. Based on the structural analysis of KSI at a high resolution, the conserved cis-Pro39 residue was proposed to be involved in the proper positioning of Asp38 , a critical catalytic residue, since the residue was found not only to be structurally associated with Asp38 , but also to confer a structural rigidity on the local active-site geometry consisting of Asp38 , Pro39 , Val40 , Gly41 and Ser42 at the flexible loop between -strands B1 and B2. In order to investigate the structural role of the conserved cis-Pro39 residue near the active site of KSI, Pro39 was replaced with alanine or glycine. The free energy of activation for the P39A and P39G mutants increased by 10.5 and 16.7 kJ/mol (2.5 and 4.0 kcal/mol) respectively, while GU H2O (the free-energy change for unfolding in the absence of urea at 25.00 + 0.02 C) decreased by 31.0 and 35.6 kJ/mol (7.4 and - 8.5 kcal/mol) respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme.

The crystal structure of the P39A mutant in complex with dequilenin [d-1,3,5(10),6,8-estrapentaen-3-ol-17-one], a reaction intermediate analogue, determined at 2.3 Å (0.23 nm) resolution revealed that the P39A mutation significantly disrupted the proper orientations of both d-equilenin and Asp38 , as well as the local active-site geometry near Asp38 , which resulted in substantial decreases in the activity and stability of KSI. Upon binding 1anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonic acid, the fluorescence intensities of the P39A and P39G mutants were increased drastically, with maximum wavelengths blue-shifted upon binding, indicating that the mutations might alter the hydrophobic active site of KSI. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the conserved cisPro39 residue plays a crucial role in the proper positioning of the critical catalytic base Asp38 and in the structural integrity of the active site in KSI. Key words: active-site geometry, cis-proline, ketosteroid isomerase, site-directed mutagenesis, structural integrity.

INTRODUCTION

The enzyme KSI ( 5 -3-ketosteroid isomerase; EC 5.3.3.1) catalyses the allylic rearrangement of a variety of 5 -3-ketosteroids to 4 -3-ketosteroids by shifting a double bond from the 5(6)position to the 4(5)-position (Scheme 1) [1]. KSI is one of the most efficient enzymes known, exhibiting a reaction rate equivalent to the diffusion-controlled limit [2]. It has been intensively investigated as a prototype to understand the catalytic mechanism of allylic rearrangement [3­7]. Structural analyses of two related KSI enzymes from different bacterial species, Pseudomonas putida biotype B and Comamonas testosteroni, by X-ray crystallography [8­10] and NMR spectroscopy [11,12] have contributed significantly to the understanding of the mechanism of efficient catalysis by KSI. Although the KSIs from P. putida and C. testosteroni have only 34 % identity in their amino acid sequences, their threedimensional structures are remarkably similar [8,9,11]. Moreover, three catalytic residues, Tyr14 , Asp38 and Asp99 , play crucial roles in catalysis. The proton at C-4 of the steroid substrate is transferred to the catalytic base Asp38 of the enzyme to generate the

dienolate intermediate, which is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds of both Tyr14 and Asp99 , and then the same proton is transferred to C-6 to generate the product (Scheme 1) [13­15]. Three catalytic residues are conserved in the two related KSIs (the residues are numbered according to those of C. testosteroni KSI throughout the text) [16­18]. Most notably, Asp38 at the active site serves as a catalytic base to abstract the C-4 proton of a steroid substrate, 5-AND (5-androstene-3,17-dione) [17]. One of the interesting features of Asp38 is that the residue is relatively rigid, even though it is exposed to solvent and is located near the flexible loop between -strands B1 and B2 (Figure 1). The KSI monomer from C. testosteroni has five proline residues, the isomerization of which is known to affect the folding process of KSI [20]. Only Pro39 has a cis-configuration [12], which can confer structural strain on Asp38 . Pro39 is conserved in the two KSIs, and is so closely located to Asp38 as to give a structural rigidity to the local active-site geometry consisting of Asp38 , Pro39 , Val40 , Gly41 and Ser42 due to its cyclic side chain [9,10]. Proline residues are unique among natural amino acids, since the cyclic side chain of proline prevents the rotation of an N­ C bond, and the peptide backbone has no amide hydrogen for

and P39G mutations. The crystal structure of the P39A mutant in complex with d-equilenin [d-1,3,5(10),6,8-estrapentaen-3-ol17-one], a reaction intermediate analogue, showed structural perturbations of Asp38 and the local active site near Asp38 , which resulted in substantial decreases in the catalytic activity and conformational stability of KSI. Our results demonstrate that the conserved cis-Pro39 residue is important for both the proper positioning of the critical catalytic residue Asp38 and the structural integrity of the active site in KSI.

hydrogen bonding. The trans isomer is favoured only slightly over the cis isomer, since the cis and trans configurations were reported to differ by only 2.1 kJ/mol (0.5 kcal/mol) in free energy [21­23]. The residue has been reported frequently to be important for the biological function and structural stability of proteins. In case of interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase, cis/trans isomerization of Pro287 within the SH2 (Src homology 2) domain acts as a molecular switch that mediates conformer-specific ligand recognition [24]. The self-association of interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase via the SH2 and SH3 domains requires cis-Pro287 , and the binding of canonical phosphopeptide is mediated by trans-Pro287 [24,25]. In addition, the cis/trans isomerization of Pro175 plays a critical role in electron transport by the membrane protein cytochrome bc1 [26]. Furthermore, replacement of the proline residue with other amino acids has unfavourable effects on protein stability. For example, the replacement of cis-Pro39 with alanine in RNase T1 substantially reduced GU H2O (the free-energy change for unfolding in the absence of urea at 25.00 + 0.02 C) by approx. - 20.1 kJ/mol (4.8 kcal/mol) [27]. In the case of RNase A, mutation 93 114 of cis-Pro or cis-Pro to glycine decreased T m (the melting temperature) by 7.3 C and 10.2 C respectively [28]. In the present study, in order to investigate the structural role of Pro39 in the catalytic activity and the active-site geometry of C. testosteroni KSI, Pro39 was replaced with alanine or glycine. Both kcat and GU H2O values were significantly decreased by the P39A

Site-directed mutagenesis

The conserved cis-Pro39 residue was replaced with alanine or glycine to make the P39A and P39G mutants respectively, using a method described previously [30]. Single-stranded and uracilcontaining template DNA complementary to the coding strand of the KSI gene was obtained from pKSI-TI [9], a recombinant plasmid containing the entire gene of C. testosteroni KSI, which had been introduced into Escherichia coli RZ1030 after infection with the helper phage M13K07 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The oligonucleotides 5 -GCCACGGTGGAAGACGCCGTGGGTTCCGAGC-3 for P39A and 5 -GGCCACGGTGGAAGACGGCGTGGGTTCCGAGCC-3 for P39G were used as a primer for each mutagenesis; the underlined nucleotides represent those changed for mutations. The entire genes of the mutant KSIs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. The recombinant plasmid containing the mutated KSI gene was digested with EcoRI and HindIII to isolate the inserted DNA fragment containing the entire KSI gene, which was then subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pKK223-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to construct the recombinant plasmid for expression. The KSI proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and protein concentrations were determined utilizing the difference in molar absorption coefficient (2330 M-1 · cm-1 per tyrosine residue) between tyrosinate and tyrosine at 295 nm, as described previously [31].

The solvent-accessible surface area was calculated from the atomic co-ordinates obtained by X-ray crystallography [9] utilizing a software program (Molecular Simulations Inc.; Quanta version 2.0) according to the procedures described previously [32]. The probe radius for the calculation was 1.4 Å (1 Å  0.1 nM).

Determination of catalytic activities and kinetic parameters

Wild-type or mutant enzyme at 15 µM was preincubated for > 48 h in buffer containing 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM EDTA with various urea concentrations from 0 to 8 M. Molar ellipticity at 222 nm and fluorescence intensity at 304 nm were determined at each urea concentration. Changes in the optical properties of the KSI proteins were compared by normalizing each transition curve with the apparent fraction of the unfolded form, F U : F U = (Y N - Y)/(Y N - Y U ) (2)

The catalytic activities of the wild-type and mutant KSIs were measured spectrophotometrically using 5-AND as a substrate according to the procedure described previously [18]. All enzyme activities were determined by use of a UV spectrophotometer (Cary; 3E) at 25.0 + 0.1 C in a buffer solution containing 34 mM - potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 2.5 mM EDTA with various substrate concentrations: 12, 35, 58, 82 and 116 µM. The kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant KSIs were determined using a non-linear least-squares method, as described previously [33].

pH­activity profiles

All buffers used to determine kinetic constants were adjusted to have constant ionic strength (I = 0.1) with NaCl. The buffers were 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 3.8­4.9), 20 mM sodium Mes (pH 5.2­6.3) and 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.6­8.0) at 25.0 + 0.1 C. The reaction procedures for obtaining kinetic - constants were the same as for the steady-state kinetic analysis described above. Stability was confirmed by incubating the enzyme in the respective assay buffer for 2 min and then determining enzyme activity at pH 7.0. The observed kinetic parameters were fitted to eqn (1) to obtain the pK E value by non-linear least-squares analysis using the program Kaleidagraph version 3.06 (Abelbeck Software).

where Y is the observed molar ellipticity or fluorescence intensity at a given urea concentration, and Y N and Y U are the observed values for the native and unfolded forms respectively at the same urea concentration. A linear dependence of Y on the denaturant concentration was observed in the baseline regions of both native and unfolded KSIs for both CD and fluorescence spectroscopic measurements. The respective baselines for native and unfolded KSIs were extrapolated linearly to estimate Y N and Y U in the transition region. The equilibrium constant (K U ) and free-energy change ( GU ) for denaturation were determined according to a two-state model of denaturation by using the following equations [34]: K U = 2PT · F U 2 (1 - F U ) GU = - RT · ln (K U ) = GU H2O - m · [urea] (3) (4)

where PT is the total protein concentration and m is a measure of the dependence of GU on urea concentration. The data of the urea unfolding transition curve were fitted to eqn (4) as described previously [35] by a non-linear least-squares analysis utilizing a graphics program (Abelbeck Software; Kaleidagraph version 2.6).

Fluorescence was measured by use of a spectrofluorimeter (Shimadzu; RF-5401) equipped with a thermostatically controlled cell holder. For fluorescence measurements, 15 µM KSI was incubated at 25.0 + 0.1 C in a buffer containing 20 mM potassium - phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM EDTA. Emission spectra were observed between 300 and 400 nm after the KSI sample was excited at 275 nm.

The difference in the free-energy change for unfolding, GU , between the wild-type enzyme and each mutant enzyme was obtained from the following equation: GU = GU - GU m (6)

where GU and GU m are the free-energy changes for unfolding of the wild-type and mutant KSIs respectively.

CD spectroscopy

CD spectroscopic analyses were performed with a spectropolarimeter (Jasco; 715). A cuvette with a path length of 2 mm was used for all CD spectral measurements. The temperature of the cuvette was adjusted by use of a Peltier-type temperature controller (Jasco; PTC-348WI). For the CD measurements, wild-type or mutant enzyme at 15 µM was incubated in buffer containing 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM EDTA. CD spectra were obtained at 25.00 + 0.02 C with a scan speed of - 10 nm/min and a bandwidth of 2 nm. Scans were collected at 1 nm intervals, with a response time of 0.25 s, and were accumulated three times. All CD spectra were corrected by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer solution.

The P39A mutant was co-crystallized with d-equilenin by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method according to the procedure described previously [10]. A 2 µl aliquot of 1 mg/ml equilenin dissolved in DMSO was mixed with 70 µl of 10 mg/ml KSI. Saturation with equilenin was comfirmed by the presence of a white precipitate formed after mixing. The crystals were grown in a solution containing 2.0 M ammonium sulphate and 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, at 22.0 + 0.1 C. For data collection, the - crystal was frozen at 100 K utilizing a cryostream cooler (Oxford Cryosystems) after it was briefly immersed in a cryoprotectant solution containing 15 % (v/v) glycerol, 2.0 M ammonium sulphate

Data reduction, merging and scaling were carried out with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK, as described previously [36]. The crystal structure of P39A KSI in complex with d-equilenin (P39A­equilenin) was determined by molecular replacement utilizing the dimeric structure of wildtype KSI [9] as a search model according to the method described previously [10].

Determination of K d for equilenin

The dissociation constant (K d ) for equilenin was determined by the fluorescence quenching method as described previously [37]. Fluorescence measurement was carried out at 25.0 + 0.1 C with - a spectrofluorimeter (Shimazu RF-5000) in a buffer solution containing 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 5 % (v/v) methanol. The fluorescence intensity of equilenin at 363 nm was obtained and used to calculate K d values for d-equilenin after excitation at 335 nm for various enzyme concentrations.

ANS-binding assay

Binding experiments with ANS were performed by incubating the wild-type and mutant proteins with ANS. KSI (15 µM) was incubated with 25 µM ANS at 25.0 + 0.1 C in a buffer - solution containing 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM EDTA. Fluorescence changes were monitored between 400 and 600 nm after the incubated solution was excited at 380 nm. Fluorescence spectra were obtained by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu RF-5401) using a cuvette with a path length of 10 mm, and the spectrum of the ANS solution without enzyme was subtracted.

Based on three-dimensional structural analysis of wild-type KSI, the side chain of Pro39 is structurally associated with Asp38 (Figure 1) [9,10]. The side chain of Asp38 interacts with d-equilenin at the active-site pocket. The pyrrolidine ring in the side chain of Pro39 is covalently linked to the polypeptide backbone of the preceding Asp38 residue. Val40 , Gly41 and Ser42 near Pro39 constitute a loop spanning -strands B1 and B2 (Figure 2), and their solvent-accessible surface areas are 14, 22, and 6 Å2 respectively, indicating that they are well or partially exposed to the aqueous environment. While Asp38 , with a solvent-accessible surface area of 16 Å2 , is exposed to solvent and located near the flexible loop between -strands B1 and B2, its B factor (average temperature factor) was found to be relatively small, and much smaller again when d-equilenin was bound to the enzyme (Figure 3).

Expression and purification of KSI proteins

Both mutant proteins P39A and P39G were expressed as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were dissolved with 8 M urea and then dialysed with a refolding buffer containing 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM EDTA. The mutant proteins were purified similarly to the wild-type enzyme [9]. The homogeneity of the purified mutant proteins was confirmed by the presence of single protein bands of an identical size corresponding to a monomer molecular mass of approx. 14 kDa upon SDS/PAGE (results not shown).

pH-dependence of kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant

The kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined at various pH values at 25.0 + 0.1 C. The lines represent non-linear least-squares fits of the data to eqn (1) - in order to obtain pK E . 5-AND was used as a substrate, and log k cat /K m values are shown for the wild type ( ), P39A ( ) and P39G ( ) enzymes.

In order to analyse the effects of the P39A and P39G mutations on the catalytic activity of KSI, the kcat and K m values of the wild-type and mutant KSIs were determined using 5-AND as a substrate. Elimination of the pyrrolidine ring from Pro39 resulted in more significant effect on kcat than on K m . The P39A and P39G mutations decreased the K m values moderately (by approx. 3.6and 4.8-fold respectively) and the kcat values significantly (by approx. 67- and 970-fold respectively) compared with the wildtype enzyme (Table 1). These results suggest that the cyclic side chain of Pro39 is important for the catalytic activity of KSI.

The fraction of unfolded protein (F U ) at each urea concentration was calculated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm and the fluorescence intensity at 304 nm with excitation at 275 nm after correction for the pre- and post-transition baselines and fitting to eqn (5). F U values for the wild type ( ), P39A ( ) and P39G ( ) enzymes are shown.

In a previous study, the catalytic base Asp was proposed to be responsible for the pH-dependent activity of KSI [4]. In order to estimate the pK a value of Asp38 in the wild-type and mutant enzymes, the kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant proteins were determined at various pH values (Figure 4). The observed kinetic parameters were fitted to eqn (1) to obtain the apparent pK E value. The pK E value of wild-type KSI was determined to be approx. 4.32 [37a], which was comparable with that in the previous study [4]. The apparent pK E values of P39A and P39G were 4.36 and 4.31 respectively, indicating that Pro39 does not affect the ionization state of Asp38 .
Effects of mutation of Pro39 on the conformational stability of KSI

An equilibrium unfolding experiment was carried out by measuring the molar ellipticity of the P39A and P39G mutants at 222 nm and the fluorescence intensity at 304 nm after excitation at 275 nm. The transition curve was normalized by assuming that the optical properties of the native and unfolded KSIs can be extrapolated linearly into the transition zone (Figure 5). The transition curves obtained by measuring molecular ellipticity and fluorescence intensity were almost identical to each other. These results strongly suggest that the folding of KSI can be explained by

a two-state model, without any folded intermediate at equilibrium. The reversible folding of the KSI mutants was analysed by comparing fluorescence and CD spectra of the protein being refolded with those of the native protein. The unfolded protein in 8 M urea was diluted successively to lower urea concentrations under reducing conditions. All mutants also exhibited the original activities after refolding. Based upon the two-state model, the GU for the wild-type values of GU H2O , m, [urea]50 % and and mutant KSIs were determined (Table 2). The P39A and P39G mutations significantly decreased GU H2O by approx. 31.0 and 35.6 kJ/mol (7.4 and 8.5 kcal/mol) respectively, suggesting that Pro39 is important for the conformational stability of KSI. The effect of the P39G mutation on protein stability was more pronounced than that of P39A. The unfolding transitions of both P39A and P39G mutants occurred at lower urea concentrations than that of the wild-type enzyme. In the transition curves of the P39A and P39G mutants, significant changes in optical properties were not observed until the urea concentration reached 1.5 M. A drastic transition was observed in the range 1.5­3.5 M urea.

Structural analysis of the P39A­equilenin complex

In order to investigate the structural changes induced by the P39A and P39G mutations at the molecular level, we attempted to crystallize the mutant enzymes with or without various steroids, and crystals of P39A in complex with equilenin were obtained successfully. The crystal structure of P39A­equilenin was determined at 2.3 Å resolution with an R value of 23.9 %. It belongs to the space group P6522 with cell dimensions of: a, 60.73 Å; b, 60.73 Å; c, 180.80 Å;  , 120.00. The crystallographic data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 3. Since no crystallographic data are available for the wild-type enzyme in complex with d-equilenin, the crystal structure of P39A­ equilenin was compared with that of a D38N mutant KSI in complex with d-equilenin (D38N­equilenin), which gives us structural information on the binding interaction between KSI and the steroid in the catalytic reaction of KSI [7,10]. Even though the overall protein structure was not changed significantly, as judged by the structural comparison between D38N­equilenin and P39A­equilenin, the local structure around Pro39 and the structural geometry of Asp38 were perturbed by eliminating the fivemembered pyrrolidine ring of the proline.

chain of Asp38 and C-4 of d-equilenin was greatly increased by 3.40 + 0.32 Å. The B factor for the C atom of Asp38 was incre- ased significantly by 44 Å2 (Figure 6). Moreover, the electrondensity maps of d-equilenin, Ala39 , Val40 and Gly41 were poorly defined (Figure 2), and the B factors of Ala39 , Val40 , Gly41 and Ser42 at the loop between -strands B1 and B2 were increased substantially in the crystal structure of P39A­equilenin (Figure 6).
Effects of mutation of Pro39 on binding of equilenin to KSI

The P39A mutant was found to disrupt the proper orientations of both Asp38 and d-equilenin in the structural analysis of P39A­ equilenin. In order to investigate the effects of mutations on the binding affinity for d-equilenin, the K d values of the wildtype, P39A and P39G enzymes were determined by measuring the extent of quenching of the fluorescence of d-equilenin upon binding the enzymes (Figure 7). The K d value of the wild-type enzyme was determined to be approx. 2.60 µM, which was similar to that in a previous study [7]. The P39A and P39G mutations decreased the K d value only by approx.1.9- and 2.3fold respectively relative to wild-type KSI (Table 4), indicating that they did not change significantly the binding affinity for the reaction intermediate analogue.

Interaction with ANS

To assess the exposed hydrophobic surface areas of the wildtype and mutant enzymes, binding experiments with ANS were carried out. ANS, a fluorescent probe, has been utilized previously in order to monitor conformational changes of the protein, with the subsequent exposure of hydrophobic sites, as described in [38,39]. When the wild-type enzyme was incubated with ANS, the fluorescence intensity was marginally increased (Figure 8). When the P39A and P39G mutants were incubated with ANS, the fluorescence intensities were increased significantly by approx. 2-fold compared with that of the wild-type enzyme with ANS, and the maximum fluorescence wavelengths were blue-shifted from 490 to 478 nm, implying that the mutant KSIs may bind ANS more tightly than does wild-type KSI.

DISCUSSION

The role of the conserved cis-Pro39 residue in the catalytic activity and the conformational stability near the active site of KSI was investigated by replacing this residue with alanine or glycine. Based on the structural analysis of P39A­equilenin and the ANS fluorescence spectra of P39A and P39G, the conserved cis-Pro39 residue was found to be crucial for the proper positioning of the critical catalytic base Asp38 and for the structural integrity of the active site in KSI. The elimination of the cyclic side chain of Pro39 disrupted the proper orientation of both Asp38 and dequilenin, leading to significant decreases in the catalytic activity and the conformational stability of KSI. The P39A and P39G mutations significantly lowered the kcat value of KSI, even though Pro39 is not directly involved in binding

of the steroid (Figure 1). This result was mainly due to the structural perturbation of Asp38 , which is structurally associated with Pro39 at the active site of KSI. The P39A and P39G mutations may decrease the rigidity of N­C rotation at this position and perturb the configuration of Asp38 , while it did not affect the ionization state of the catalytically important base. Even though the electron density of Asp38 was defined in the crystal structure of P39A­equilenin, Asp38 became much more flexible and oriented away from the -face of d-equilenin. In addition, the electrondensity map of d-equilenin was not well defined in the crystal structure of P39A­equilenin, reflecting the fact that d-equilenin is bound less productively to the P39A enzyme than to the wildtype enzyme. These observations strongly suggest that Pro39 plays an important role in the catalytic activity of KSI through the proper positioning of Asp38 to abstract stereospecifically the C-4 proton from the substrate steroid. The substantial decreases in the GU H2O values of the P39A and P39G mutants compared with the wild type suggest that cisPro39 is important for the conformational stability as well as the structural integrity of KSI. Even though Asp38 is relatively rigid due to the cyclic side chain and the structural strain of the cisPro39 residue, it can be structurally perturbed, since it is exposed to solvent and located near the flexible loop between -strands B1 and B2. The replacement of Pro39 with a smaller residue, i.e. alanine or glycine, could make the catalytic residue Asp38 more flexible. Decreases in both the stability and the activity of KSI were observed in the P39A and P39G mutants, implying that stabilization of the local active-site structure near Asp38 is related to the activity of KSI. While the overall structure was not changed significantly by the P39A and P39G mutations, as reflected in the far-UV CD spectra (results not shown), the crystal structure of P39A­equilenin exhibited significant structural perturbation of the local active-site geometry consisting of Asp38 , Ala39 , Val40 , Gly41 and Ser42 at the flexible loop. These observations suggest that the cis-Pro39 residue is crucial for the stabilization of local active-site geometry as well as for the proper positioning of Asp38 in the active site of KSI. The crystallographic data were found to be consistent with the ANS fluorescence spectra for the P39A and P39G mutants. The perturbed active site near Asp38 was highly flexible and well exposed to solvent by the P39A mutation; this indicates that ANS may bind better to the P39A and P39G mutants, enhancing ANS fluorescence intensity and blueshifting the maximum wavelengths of the mutants. The structural significance of the conserved cis-Pro39 residue might also explain the previous observation that the prolyl isomerization accelerated by cyclophilin A, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, may be important for the refolding process of KSI [20]. Approx. 6 % of Xaa­Pro peptide bonds in known protein structures have been reported to have cis configuration [22,40]. The kinetic barrier for rotation of a Xaa­Pro peptide bond is low enough to allow equilibration of the isomers in an unfolded protein, but high enough to limit the rate of protein folding. The occurrence of cis-proline residues in a protein structure often has a significant influence on protein activity and stability [41­45]. In the tryptophan synthase  subunit, the P207A mutant has a less negative CD intensity than the wild-type protein, indicating a role for Pro207 in maintaining the intact structure [41]. In staphylococcal nuclease, a P31A mutation led to a small decrease in stability of 2.5 kJ/mol (0.6 kcal/mol), and P117G and P117T mutations affected the folding process [42]. In the case of pancreatic RNase A, mutation of conserved two cis-proline residues (P93A, P39S, P114A and P114S) has been shown to induce decreases in stability of 8.4­12.6 kJ/mol (2­3 kcal/mol) [43]. For bovine adrenodoxin, mutation of the conserved Pro108 residue (P108A, P108S, P108W and P108K)

decreased stability by 5.0­10.7 kJ/mol [44]. The mutational effect was more substantial for E. coli thioredoxin, where a P76A mutation decreased T m from 82 to 65 C [45], indicating that proline is important for protein stability. Proline is also known to be important for catalytic activity through the maintenance of active-site integrity in some proteins. In E. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase, the conserved cis-Pro268 residue is located near the preceding Leu267 residue, whose carbonyl oxygen interacts with the nitrogen of the bisubstrate analogue N-phosphonacetylL-aspartate bound at the active site [46­48]. Replacement of cis-Pro268 with alanine resulted in a 40-fold decrease in activity, and altered the tertiary structure of the catalytic subunit [49]. In functional analysis of the conserved cis-Pro53 residue in Proteus mirabilis glutathione transferase B1-1, cis-Pro53 was found to contribute to activity through the maintenance of the proper conformation of the binding site for glutathione [50]. Thus the above examples emphasize the importance of cis-Pro residues for the conformational stability and structural integrity of the active site in proteins. In summary, our results demonstrate that the conserved cisPro39 residue plays a crucial role in the proper positioning of the catalytic base Asp38 and in maintaning the structural integrity of the local active-site geometry near Asp38 in C. testosteroni KSI. The significant effects of the P39A and P39G mutations on the kcat value suggested that Pro39 is important for catalytic activity even though this residue is not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of KSI. These studies will contribute to a better understanding of the role of the proline residue in protein structure. Further investigation is required to explore the observation that the cis/trans isomerization of Pro39 is important for the correct folding of KSI.
