Abstract Potential inhibitory effects of the clinically utilized monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP) on mammalian, plant, bacterial, and fungal copper-containing amine oxidases have been examined. The following enzymes have been investigated: human kidney diamine oxidase (HKAO), bovine plasma amine oxidase (BPAO), equine plasma amine oxidase (EPAO), pea seedling amine oxidase (PSAO), Arthrobacter globiformis amine oxidase (AGAO), and Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase (PPLO). Only BPAO, EPAO, and AGAO were found to lose significant levels of activity when incubated with varying amounts of TCP. Inhibition of BPAO was completely reversible, with dialysis restoring full activity. TCP inhibition of AGAO was also found to be ultimately reversible; however, dialysis did not remove all bound compounds. Chemical displacement with either substrate or a substrate analogue successfully removed all bound TCP, indicating that this compound has a high affinity for the active site of AGAO. The notable lack of TCP inhibition on HKAO argues against the inhibition of diamine oxidase as a potential source for some of the deleterious side effects occurring in patients treated with this antidepressant. The marked differences observed in behavior among these enzymes speaks to the importance of intrinsic structural differences between the active sites of copper amine oxidases (CAO) which affect reactivity with a given inhibitor.

1. Introduction Copper-containing amine oxidases catalyze the metabolic oxidative deamination of primary amines to the corresponding aldehydes, with concurrent production of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia (Eq. (1)). This reaction proceeds through a transamination mechanism mediated by

an active site 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor, formed from the post-translational self-processing of a tyrosine residue (Fig. 1). RCH2 NHþ þ O2 þ H2 O ! RCHO þ NHþ þ H2 O2 3 4 ð1Þ

The key transition in catalysis is the transamination step resulting from conversion of the initial substrate Schiff base (Fig. 1) to a product Schiff base, facilitated by Ca proton abstraction by an absolutely conserved active-site aspartate acting as general base [1­ 5]. Hydrolytic release of aldehyde product gives a Cu(II)-aminoquinol in equilibrium with Cu(I)-semiquinone, which is reoxidized to the resting TPQ cofactor in the presence of O2, with release of H2O2 and + NH4 [6]. Copper amine oxidases (CAO) are widely distributed in nature and have been purified from several sources including bacteria, plants, and mammals, including human kidney [7]. In microorganisms, these enzymes have a nutritional role in the utilization of primary amines as the sole source of nitrogen or carbon, while in mammals and plants, certain

amine oxidases are tissue-specific and are implicated in wound healing, detoxification, cell growth, signaling, and apoptosis [1,6 ­ 8]. Furthermore, mammalian lysyl oxidase, a CAO-containing lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ) as its redox cofactor, catalyzes the crucial deamination of the side-chain of peptidyl lysine, initiating the cross-linking of lysine residues in collagen and elastin [9,10]. Awareness of more extensive physiological roles for human amine oxidases is developing; for example, AOs are implicated in the formation of vascular plaques linked to congestive heart failure [11], and human vascular adhesion protein (HVAP-1), which mediates interactions between lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells [12], is a membrane-bound amine oxidase [13,14]. This lymphocyte migration was recently hypothesized to be mediated by AO catalytic activity through the temporary adhesion formed via Schiff base linkage between the catalytic TPQ and a lysine group on the surface of the lymphocyte, with subsequent turnover resulting in cell release [15]. Mechanism-based inhibition of CAOs has been extensively studied based on the strategy of creating substrate analogues that contain either unsaturation or halogen substitution at the h position. This approach enables the formation of an electrophile formed upon Ca proton abstraction from the substrate Schiff base species, and has been successful in designing several selective AO inhibitors [16 ­ 19]. The problem with designing such primary amine analogues concerns cross-reactivity with enzymes that carry + out the same overall chemistry (RCH2NH3 ! RCHO), such as the monoamine oxidase flavoenzymes A and B, located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. MAO enzymes catalyze the oxidative deamination of several biogenic amines, including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and tyramine, which are also oxidized by at least some CAOs, although they do so through a mechanism which does not proceed through transamination [20,21]. One such example of cross-reactivity between these two families of amine oxidases concerns propargylamine derivatives, which have been reported to inhibit plasma amine oxidase [16], semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) [22,23], and monoamine oxidase [24 ­ 26]. Recently, we have been involved in a study reporting the first example of a class of compounds (3-pyrrolines) which selectively inhibit only the copper-containing amine oxidase family, while acting as pure substrates for the MAO family [27].

Due to their role in degrading neurotransmitters, MAOs have been a target for inhibition in patients suffering from depression [21]. Tranylcypromine (TCP, brand name Parnate) is a reversible MAO inhibitor administered as a racemic mixture of the two trans enantiomers 1S,2R-(+)trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine (Fig. 1) and 1R,2S-( À )trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine [28,29], although (+)-TCP is 10 times more potent a MAO inhibitor than ( À )-TCP in vivo [28,30,31], and ( À )-TCP causes f 3 times greater inhibition of synaptic catecholamine uptake [28,32]. Moises and Beckmann [31], in a study involving the efficacy of both enantiomers, showed that side effects including agitation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and loss of weight were more pronounced only in those patients treated with the (+)isomer. TCP was also discovered to inhibit the CAO from Escherichia coli [33]. Subsequent studies have resulted in utilizing TCP as a CAO substrate analogue to examine the reductive half reaction during catalysis in ECAO, as well as the recent determination of the ECAO ­TCP crystal structure [34]. The (+)-enantiomer was only found to bind to the enzyme, and the ECAO ­TCP structure was discovered to be quite similar to the ECAO-2-hydrazinopyridine structure, with both TPQ-inhibitor adducts resembling the substrate Schiff base moiety (Fig. 1) [34]. This study examines the inhibitory effects of TCP upon six additional copper-containing amine oxidases: three mammalian AOs, equine plasma amine oxidase (EPAO), bovine plasma amine oxidase (BPAO), and human kidney amine oxidase (HKAO); one plant AO, pea seedling amine oxidase (PSAO), one bacterial AO, Arthrobacter globiformis amine oxidase (AGAO), and one yeast amine oxidase Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase (PPLO). AGAO and BPAO were found to be the most sensitive to TCP and inhibition was discovered to be reversible, consistent with that reported for ECAO inactivation by (+)-TCP [34]. Gel filtration followed by extensive dialysis did not completely remove bound TCP from AGAO but binding was shown to be reversible. This observation was surprising and indicates that significant differences exist between the two bacterial AOs, AGAO and ECAO, which influence how each respective enzyme interacts with TCP.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Enzyme isolation and purification PSAO, PPLO, EPAO, and BPAO were purified as described previously [19]. AGAO was purified as described in Ref. [35], and HKAO was purified as explained in Ref. [7]. 2.2. Inhibitor preparation Tranylcypromine hydrochloride obtained from Aldrich was used with no further purification. Stock inhibitor

solutions were prepared by dissolving required amounts of compound in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, to yield a final concentration between 1 and 10 mM. Solutions of TCP were found to be stable at 25 jC for at least 24 h, and remained stable for over 96 h at 4 jC, consistent with previous reports [34]. Solutions were made up fresh directly prior to use. Due to the report by Saysell et al. [34] which indicates that only the (+)-TCP enantiomer reacts with ECAO, calculated TCP excess reported in Table 1 is listed relative to the (+)-isomer. 2.3. Spectroscopic analysis and steady-state kinetics Absorption spectra and kinetic data were collected at 25 jC using a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cuvette holder connected to an Endocal RTE-5 circulating water bath. Protein concentrations were calculated utilizing e280 as previously reported for AGAO [35], EPAO [36], PSAO [37], BPAO [38], PPLO [39], and HKAO [7]. All solutions were stirred during assays, with benzylamine used as a control substrate. Experiments were run with freshly thawed protein aliquots from the same enzyme stock. Enzyme activity is reported as spectroscopic units per milligram of protein (Table 1). To analyze the general effectiveness of TCP against the six CAO enzymes, respected enzyme samples were incubated with varying amounts of TCP for 30 min at 30 jC. Activity was then monitored spectroscopically using benzylamine as substrate at 25 jC in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 as described in Ref. [19]. Assays were run in triplicate for each inhibitor concentration listed in Table 1. Time-based kinetic analysis of TCP inhibition of AGAO was performed

as described in Ref. [19]. Samples subjected to gel filtration were run over a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia, PD-10), clearly separating excess TCP from enzyme. Time-dependent spectroscopic inhibition of AGAO by TCP involved adding a 200-fold excess of racemic TCP to an 11.8 AM sample of AGAO in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The sample was mixed and a spectrum was immediately recorded. Subsequent spectra were recorded at different time intervals out to 3.5 h. Kinetic assays were then performed as described above. While the stock solution of TCP was found to have a kmax at 260 nm, absorbance at 280 nm was found to be negligible. 2.4. Titrations with phenylhydrazine and benzylamine Reactive TPQ can be quantified by its titration with phenylhydrazine, which reacts stoichiometrically with the C5 carbonyl of TPQ, forming a stable, intensely yellowcolored adduct with kmax f 450 nm and extinction coefficient of f 32,000 MÀ 1 cmÀ 1 [40,41]. In order to determine if TCP binding to the quinone cofactor of AGAO was completely reversible, a sample of AGAO was prepared and titrated with phenylhydrazine. The AGAO sample was prepared by incubating TCP with enzyme, as described above, until only f 5% activity remained. This sample was then subjected to gel filtration utilizing a Sephadex G25 column. The sample was then extensively dialyzed (three exchanges against 1 L of 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) for f 20 h at 4 jC, concentrated, and then titrated with phenylhydrazine. A phenylhydrazine stock solution was prepared immediately prior to use. Due to the instability of phenylhydrazine, the stock solution was kept anaerobic by gently bubbling Ar gas through it. Phenylhydrazine was added to the 5.8 AM enzyme solution in 2 Al increments, yielding 1.14 AM additions, or 0.2 increments of reactive TPQ. The titration was carried out at 25 jC in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and was repeated three times. A control experiment of native enzyme from the same protein stock was also titrated. Adduct formation was monitored by following the change in absorbance at 442 nm. The reversibility of TCP binding in AGAO was further examined by titrating in the substrate benzylamine under anaerobic conditions. A 4.3 AM sample of AGAO inhibited by a 100-fold excess of (+)-TCP was prepared as described above in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The sample was then made anaerobic by gently blowing Ar gas over the enzyme-inhibitor mixture in a tightly sealed cuvette for 2 h. Anaerobic benzylamine (100 mM stock solution) was then added to the sample in substoichiometric increments gradually building to a large excess ( f 150-fold). The absorbance at 350 nm was monitored. 2.5. Determination of TCP turnover by AGAO Determination of TCP oxidation was measured by monitoring H2O2 production using a horseradish peroxidase

(HRP)-ABTS(2,2V -azino-bis(3-ethyl)benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, Sigma) coupled assay. HRP reacts with H2O2 to form an activated complex that oxidizes ABTS to a product with a kmax of 414 nm [42]. Assays were performed at 30 jC in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Total assay volume was 1 ml, and substrate concentration was adjusted accordingly to yield a final concentration of 300 AM. Protein concentration in the assay was 0.293 AM, yielding f 250fold excess of each TCP enantiomer over active sites. Benzylamine was used as a control substrate, and assays were run in triplicate. A small blank rate was obtained using ABTS, HRP, TCP, and buffer, which was nearly identical to those blank rates obtained with ABTS, HRP, and buffer. No significant side reactions between ABTS and TCP were observed to occur as reported in Ref. [34].

3. Results 3.1. TCP inhibition of six copper amine oxidases As seen in Table 1, only the two mammalian plasma enzymes EPAO and BPAO and the bacterial enzyme AGAO displayed significant levels of inhibition with TCP following a 30 min incubation with reported compound excesses. The inhibitory potency of TCP on these enzymes follows the trend AGAO>BPAO>EPAOHPPLO>PSAO>HKAO. Time-based studies performed with a 200-fold excess of TCP revealed that AGAO activity dropped to less than 5% almost immediately. This concurs with the time-based spectroscopic analysis of TCP binding, which indicates that TCP binds rapidly to the enzyme based on the observation that the TPQ ­ TCP complex in AGAO (see next section) shows no significant change in absorbance at 350 nm over a period of 3.5 h (data not shown). Activity at this time was identical to that reported in Table 1. Interestingly, when AGAO of very high specific activity is incubated with 100fold excess of (+)-TCP [35], activity remaining after 30 min is f 15%. 3.2. Spectroscopic analysis AGAO and BPAO samples were incubated with a given molar excess of TCP determined to yield greater than 75% inactivation following a 30-min incubation at 30 jC. TCP binding to AGAO was shown to form a complex with a kmax at 350 nm and binding to BPAO was shown to form a complex with a kmax f 370 nm; both representing slight shifts from the ECAO ­ TCP complex which was shown to have a kmax at 365 nm [34]. BPAO inhibited by TCP was subjected to gel filtration and despite clearly separating excess TCP from the enzyme, a significant amount of TCP was still bound to BPAO indicating that this compound has fairly high affinity for the active site. The same sample was then extensively dialyzed and the native spectrum of BPAO was seen to return with a kmax at 480 nm due to the

unmodified TPQ chromophore (data not shown). Activity assays confirmed the full restoration of BPAO activity, similar to what is reported for TCP inhibition of ECAO [34]. Interestingly, complete removal of TCP bound to AGAO did not occur following either gel filtration or dialysis, suggesting inhibition with TCP is not readily reversible (Fig. 2). The post-gel filtration spectrum shown is at a concentration of 40.7 AM protein, while the post-dialysis spectrum shown is at a concentration of 20.4 AM protein. The main difference in absorbance between the post-gel filtration and post-dialysis spectra in Fig. 2 is due to dilution of the sample during dialysis. Utilizing the 1.2 titrateable TPQs per enzyme (discussed in following section), these protein concentrations correlate to 48.9 and 24.4 AM reactive TPQs, respectively. Based on the absorbance at 480 nm and using an extinction coefficient of f 3200 MÀ 1 cmÀ 1 for TPQ [43,44], this indicates that f 64% of reactive TPQ in the post-gel filtration spectrum are modified, whereas f 45% of reactive TPQ are modified in the post-dialysis spectrum. This is consistent with the measured increase in levels of activity between these samples; post-gel filtration assays indicated f 25% of full activity, whereas postdialysis assays revealed 60% of full activity. A different sample of AGAO prepared in the aforementioned manner was allowed to dialyze for 60 h, with measured activity increasing to 76%, with an estimated 30% of reactive TPQ modified. 3.3. Titrations with phenylhydrazine and benzylamine The potential reactivity of the post-dialysis TCP ­ AGAO adduct (kmax 350 nm; Fig. 2) towards carbonyl reagents was examined via phenylhydrazine titration (Fig. 3). Absorbance at 350 nm is seen to decrease with increasing equivalents of phenylhydrazine, indicating that phenylhydrazine displaces TCP from TPQ to form the phenylhydrazone derivative of

the quinone cofactor with kmax at 442 nm. The initial sample contains 11.6 AM potential reactive TPQ (based on f 1 reactive cofactor per monomer). The absorbance at 480 nm is 0.0153 and using an extinction coefficient of 3200 MÀ 1 cmÀ 1 for the native cofactor, there is approximately 4.8 AM unmodified TPQ in this sample. Absorbance of the 442 nm adduct reached a maximum at 1.2 equivalents of phenylhydrazine, suggesting that there are 1.2 reactive TPQs per dimer, consistent with control titrations (data not shown) and that previously reported [35]. This measurement is also comparable to the 1.3 reactive cofactors per protein dimer reported for titration of ECAO with TCP [34]. Due to the lack of a significant decrease in absorbance at 350 nm for the first two equivalents (1.14 AM additions) of phenylhydrazine, it appears that phenylhydrazine preferentially reacts with the cofactors that are unmodified by TCP. However, by the third addition of phenylhydrazine, substantial loss of absorbance at 350 nm is observed. Subsequent additions of phenylhydrazine resulted in continued loss of absorbance at 350 nm with concurrent increase in absorbance at 442 nm, until all bound TCP was displaced. To examine if benzylamine could also displace bound TCP from the active site of AGAO, an anaerobic titration was performed. Under these conditions, the cofactor is prevented from reoxidizing, trapping the TPQ aminoquinol and semiquinone equilibrium species [45]. The semiquinone can easily be observed to form given its characteristic absorption spectra (kmax 360, 434, and 464 nm) [45,46]. In this case, substoichiometric additions of benzylamine were found to decrease the absorbance at 350 nm, with

the slow accumulation of the semiquinone species (data not shown). This experiment substantiates the result obtained from the phenylhydrazine titration indicating that both substrates and substrate analogs can displace TCP bound to TPQ. 3.4. Determination of TCP oxidation Based on the observation that only (+)-TCP binds to ECAO, Wilmot et al. examined whether ( À )-TCP was acting as a substrate for ECAO by monitoring oxygen consumption. No oxidation of ( À )-TCP was observed indicating that this enantiomer cannot form a substrate Schiff base with the TPQ cofactor (Wilmot, C.M., personal communication). Similar results were obtained in this study with AGAO by monitoring H2O2 production, indicating that no detectable oxidation of the racemic TCP mixture occurs. We conclude that neither TCP enantiomer is oxidized by AGAO.

4. Discussion Tranylcypromine is an antidepressant administered clinically as a racemic mixture of the 1S,2R-(+)- and 1R,2S( À )-trans enantiomers [28,29]. TCP is a reversible MAO inhibitor and the (+)-enantiomer has been shown to induce numerous severe side effects in patients [31]. Recent structural and kinetic studies have extensively characterized the molecular nature of the interaction between TCP and

257

ECAO, revealing that (+)-TCP binds to C5 of the quinone cofactor as the substrate Schiff base species with kmax of 365 nm [34]. AGAO oxidation of TCP was not detected in this study, consistent with that observed for ECAO (Wilmot, C.M., personal communication). In the latter case, failure of ECAO to abstract a proton from Ca of ( À )-TCP is expected based on the pro-S stereospecificity of this enzyme [47]. Modelling studies support the conclusion that ( À )TCP cannot access the active site of ECAO due to steric exclusion (Wilmot, C.M., personal communication). Stereospecificity for Ca proton abstraction for other CAOs depends upon the source of enzyme. For example, pig and horse plasma amine oxidase are pro-R specific for proton abstraction from tyramine [48,49], whereas pea seedling, chick pea seedling, soybean seedling and pig kidney have been shown to be pro-S specific for proton abstraction from tyramine [48,50]. Along these lines, it is possible that other CAOs could bind both enantiomers or specifically bind ( À )-TCP rather than (+)-TCP. Oxidation of either ( À )TCP or (+)-TCP may also occur in select cases and the formation of a ketone could be a potential source of side reactions with excess TCP. Given the disparity among amine oxidases in processing different enantiomers, it is also plausible that AGAO binds both (+)- and ( À )-TCP. The inability to completely remove bound TCP from AGAO following gel filtration and dialysis (Fig. 2) may indicate a mixed population of modified cofactor. Each enantiomer could interact with AGAO in a slightly different manner, due to distinct orientations of the cyclopropyl and phenyl rings of each TCP enantiomer. This could result in one enantiomer being easier to remove than another. The lack of a clean isosbestic point at f 375 nm (Fig. 3) may be evidence in support of a mixed population of TPQ adducts modified by both TCP enantiomers. Additional studies of interest have utilized TCP to examine the effect upon activation of SSAO following long-term MAO inhibition [51,52]. SSAO levels were found to increase substantially, suggesting that SSAO can to some extent compensate for loss of MAO activity. Furthermore, the IC50 value for SSAO inhibition by TCP in rat heart homogenates was calculated to be 88 AM [52]. However, no significant inhibition of SSAO was observed at TCP concentrations between 0.2 and 1 AM, which afforded between 65% and 90% inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively [52]. The observation of SSAO inhibition by TCP is comparable to the results obtained in this study relating to TCP inhibition of the mammalian plasma enzymes EPAO and BPAO (Table 1). Extrapolating the data in Table 1 and calculating the exact molar (+)-TCP concentration yields 212 AM inhibitor for the 100-fold excess EPAO data (57% activity). This suggests that the IC50 at 30 min for TCP inhibition of EPAO is slightly greater than 212 AM. In the case of BPAO, TCP concentrations are 137 AM for the 50fold excess (68% activity) and 196 AM for the 100-fold

excess (38% activity), indicating that the IC50 is between these respective concentrations. The inability to completely remove bound TCP from BPAO following gel filtration suggests that TCP displays significant affinity for the active site. AGAO was found to be the most sensitive to inhibition by TCP with the estimated IC50 calculated to be slightly greater than 38 AM. The plant PSAO and the yeast PPLO did not display any significant levels of inhibition with TCP. It is of particular interest that TCP did not inhibit HKAO to any measurable extent. Thus we may infer that the side effects associated with TCP therapies are not associated with inhibition of human diamine oxidase. The relatively low IC50 calculated for TCP inhibition of AGAO is consistent with the rapid loss of activity measured in the time-based kinetic experiment and the rapid binding of TCP as observed in the time-based spectroscopy experiment. The trend noted for increasing activity of AGAO inhibited by TCP following gel filtration with subsequent dialysis also indicates that TCP has a fairly high affinity (low Kd) for the active site of AGAO. If this complex had a high Kd (or a higher koff), then nearly complete removal of TCP would most likely result following either gel filtration or dialysis. The results obtained for the post-dialysis sample point to approximately 50% active site occupation by TCP (Fig. 2). Slightly greater removal of bound inhibitor was obtained by allowing the sample to dialyze for an extremely long period of time. It is of interest that the most effective way of removing bound TCP from AGAO samples is through chemical displacement via titration with either benzylamine or phenylhydrazine (Fig. 3). This confirms the premise that TCP has substantial affinity for approximately half the active sites. The ability of substrate analogs and/or substrate to displace bound TCP signifies that the C5 of the cofactor still contains enough electrophilic character in the substrate Schiff base moiety to undergo nucleophilic attack by the primary amine. As anticipated, the displacement of TCP does not occur instantaneously, as levels of activity in a 3min benzylamine assay would then be expected to be much greater than those reported. In addition, the time noted for the absorbance at 442 nm to stop changing following each addition of phenylhydrazine between 0.4 and 1.2 equivalents was f 15 min, as compared to the control where the absorbance stopped changing following each addition at f 5 min. The Ki for the ECAO ­ TCP adduct was calculated to be f 1.2 AM and dialysis completely removed bound TCP [34]. Taken collectively, the results presented here support the notion that while inhibition of AGAO by TCP is fully reversible, the AGAO ­ TCP adduct must have a low dissociation constant. This is consistent with the formation of a substrate Schiff base adduct that is not processed further by the enzyme. This study has examined the inhibitory potency of the MAOI tranylcypromine on six CAOs. Only BPAO, EPAO, and AGAO displayed significant losses of activity when

incubated with varying amounts of this compound. TCP inhibition of BPAO was shown to be completely reversible, with restoration of full activity following dialysis. AGAO inhibition also proved to be completely reversible, however, dialysis could not extract all bound compound. TCP could be removed upon chemical displacement either with a substrate or a substrate analogue, suggesting that TCP has very high affinity for the active site of AGAO. These results speak to the fundamental role that intrinsic structural differences in the active sites of distinct CAOs play in determining observed differences in reactivity with a given inhibitor [19]. Finally, the absence of TCP affects on HKAO argues against the inhibition of diamine oxidase as a potential source for some of the deleterious side effects occurring in patients treated with TCP.
