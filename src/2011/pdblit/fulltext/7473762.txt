Adaptor proteins in lymphocyte activation
Erin JanssenÃ and Weiguo Zhangy
Adaptor proteins are unique, as they contain modular domains and lack intrinsic enzymatic activity. These proteins are scaffolds for the organization of macromolecular complexes and they recruit other proteins for correct localization during molecular signal transduction. Numerous recent advances have been made through the elucidation of new adaptor proteins and the recognition of novel functions for previously identified molecules. In addition, the roles of adaptors in both the positive and negative regulation of lymphocyte activation have been further clarified.

Current Opinion in Immunology 2003, 15:269­276 This review comes from a themed issue on Lymphocyte activation ´ Edited by Andrey Shaw and Andre Veillette 0952-7915/03/$ ­ see front matter ß 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. DOI 10.1016/S0952-7915(03)00044-X

They differ from other signaling proteins as they lack inherent catalytic activity. Instead, adaptors are primarily composed of modular domains that bind and recruit other signaling proteins. These modules include Src homology 2 (SH2) and PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domains that recognize short phosphotyrosine (pY) motifs, SH3 and WW domains that bind proline-rich (PR) regions, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that associate with phosphoinositides (reviewed in [1]). Many adaptors contain multiple domains and act as scaffolds to facilitate the formation of macromolecular signaling complexes (Figure 1). Numerous comprehensive reviews on lymphocyte adaptor proteins have been published [2­7]. Here, we will focus on recent advances in the field of adaptor proteins, highlighting their part in the positive and negative regulation of lymphocyte activation.

Linker for activation of T cells (LAT) is an integral membrane protein with a short extracellular domain and a long cytoplasmic tail containing multiple tyrosinebased motifs. LAT is localized to lipid rafts and is highly phosphorylated by zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70) upon T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation. Its phosphorylated tyrosines selectively recruit the SH2 domain-containing adaptors Grb2 and Gads (for Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc), as well as phospholipase C (PLC)-g1 (reviewed in [8]). From the examination of LAT-deficient mice it was discovered that LAT plays an essential role in T-cell development [9]. Recent studies demonstrate that the four membrane distal tyrosines of LAT are crucial for its function in pre-TCR signaling. In knock-in mice that express LAT with mutations at the four distal tyrosines, thymocyte development is arrested at the CD4ÀCD8À stage [10]. Furthermore, a LAT mutant containing only these distal tyrosines is able to reconstitute both signaling in LAT-deficient cells and thymocyte development in LAT-deficient mice [11]. The importance of the LAT­PLC-g1 interaction was examined using knock-in mice with a mutation at LAT Tyr136, the residue critical in binding PLC-g1. Thymocyte development is partially blocked in these mice [12,13]. Mature T cells have defects in TCR-induced PLC-g1 phosphorylation, calcium flux and NFAT (for nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation [12]. Interestingly, an increase in the CD4þ:CD8þ T-cell ratio

was observed. In the periphery of these knock-in animals, CD4þ cells have an activated or memory phenotype with only low levels of the TCR­CD3 complex on their surface. With age these mice develop signs of an autoimmune disorder, including splenic enlargement, eosinophilia, increased numbers of CD4þ cells and inappropriate secretion of type II cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, IL-10; [12,13]). This highlights the effects that a single amino acid substitution can have on significant processes such as thymocyte selection and immune system homeostasis.

LAT localization was found to be exquisitely sensitive to the redox state within the cell. In an oxidizing environment, such as that observed in the synovial T cells of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), LAT is no longer found in the membrane [14,15]. It was proposed that, in cases of chronic oxidative stress, disulfide bonds form between LAT cysteine residues (Cys117 and either Cys26 or Cys29) leading to a conformational change and membrane displacement [15]. Given the importance of LAT in T-cell signaling, these findings may help to

explain the hyporesponsive state of T lymphocytes in the synovium of RA patients.
SLP-76

SLP-76 (for SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) is a cytosolic adaptor that associates with LAT via Gads or Grb 2. In contrast to LAT, SLP-76 has an amino-terminal domain containing several tyrosines followed by a PR region and an SH2 domain. The PR region of SLP-76 constitutively associates with the carboxyterminal SH3 domain of Gads [16,17]. Reconstitution studies with PR domain mutants show that deletion of this region leads to a reduction in PLC-g1 phosphorylation, calcium flux and Erk activation after TCR ligation [18,19]. Within this PR domain, a segment (P-1) was identified that constitutively associates with the SH3 domain of PLC-g1. P-1 is necessary for maximal activation of PLC-g1 and Erk [20]. The PR region therefore provides another pathway for PLC-g1 recruitment to the LAT signaling complex in T cells. It is possible that engagement of multiple PLC-g1 domains by LAT and SLP-76 is required for full activation of PLC-g1 and its stable incorporation into the complex. Two recent papers examine the function of SLP-76 domains in T-cell development and activation [18,19]. Thymocytes from transgenic mice expressing a SLP-76 mutant with deletion of the amino terminus (D2­156) are unable to develop past the CD4ÀCD8À stage [19]. Mature T cells do develop in mice expressing SLP-76 with mutations in either the PR region or SH2 domain, but they fail to upregulate CD69 [18] or proliferate appropriately in response to anti-CD3 stimulation [18,19]. As discussed above, the PR domain is vital in binding Gads; the phenotype of the PR domain mutants is similar to that observed in Gads-deficient mice [21]. The SH2 domain of SLP-76 has been identified as the region involved in binding the serine/threonine kinase HPK1, as mutation of the SLP-76 SH2 domain leads to a significant reduction in HPK1 activity. HPK1 may act as both a positive and a negative regulator by promoting the Jnk mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and inhibiting the pathway leading to AP-1 activation [22]. Similar to PLC-g1, it appears that HPK1 associates with the LAT complex in two ways, through Gads [23] and SLP-76. Two SLP-76 homologs, B-cell linker (BLNK) and cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell linker (CLNK), also interact with HPK1 in a similar manner [22,24]. Although CLNK is believed to associate with a varied set of proteins to SLP-76, it can rescue signaling in SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells, possibly through its binding of HPK1 [24].
BLNK

The phosphatase SHP-1 (for SH-containing tyrosine phosphatase) was shown to disrupt the association of Nck with BLNK by dephosphorylating these tyrosines. The association with Nck may link BLNK with activation of the Jnk pathway [26]. Furthermore, mutation of the five BLNK tyrosines evince that the complex of BLNK with PLC-g2, Btk, Vav and Nck is vital for proper B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling [25]. It is unclear how BLNK is recruited to the membrane. One possibility is that BLNK directly associates with the BCR complex. Indeed, the SH2 domain of BLNK can bind non-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (non-ITAM) tyrosines on the Iga chain [27,28]. Mutations in these two non-ITAM tyrosines (Tyr176,Tyr 204) lead to an abrogation of calcium flux and MAPK activation. Moreover, a chimeric protein composed of the plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), a mutated Iga Tyr176/204Phe tail and BLNK, which is constitutively targeted to the membrane, not only rescues but also augments these signaling events [28]. This suggests that one avenue for BLNK recruitment is through Iga.
LAB/NTAL

An alternative scenario for BLNK recruitment involves a LAT-like molecule in B cells. This molecule, called either linker for activation of B cells (LAB) or nonT-cell activation linker (NTAL), was recently identified [29,30]. LAB is expressed in B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes and mast cells [30]. Similar to LAT, LAB is localized to lipid rafts and contains multiple conserved tyrosine motifs. When activated through the BCR and other immune receptors, LAB is phosphorylated, probably by Syk, and interacts with Grb2. Unlike LAT, however, LAB does not associate with PLC-g isoforms [29,30]. LAB is able to partially reconstitute calcium flux and Erk activation in LAT-deficient Jurkat T cells [30]. In addition, when LAB protein levels are decreased in B cells using RNA interference, calcium flux and Erk activation are diminished [29]. This demonstrates that LAB operates in the calcium and Ras-MAPK signaling pathways, similar to LAT. Furthermore, LAB can effectively substitute for LAT in thymocyte development. However, LAT and LAB do have some exclusive functions, since when LAB is expressed in mature T cells it causes aberrant activation [29]. We propose that one function of LAB is to recruit BLNK to the membrane in B cells through its association with Grb2, with LAB­BLNK forming a functional equivalent of LAT­SLP-76 (Figure 2).
Grb2, Gads and Shc

Recent mapping of the tyrosine residues in BLNK reveal three tyrosines that bind PLC-g2, and two tyrosines that bind the Tec family kinase Btk, the Vav nucleotide exchange factor, and the adaptor Nck [25].

Proximal adaptors in lymphocyte signaling. (a) Following stimulation through the TCR, one early signaling event is the phosphorylation of tyrosines on ITAMs present in the tails of CD3 components by the src kinase Lck. These phosphorylated residues provide docking sites for the SH2 domains of the Syk family kinase ZAP-70, which is activated and goes on to phosphorylate the multiple tyrosines on LAT. This in turn leads to the recruitment of LAT-associated proteins such as Grb2, Gads and PLC-g1. SLP-76 is also recruited to this complex via its constitutive association with Gads, and its basal association with PLC-g1 may enhance the stabilization of this conglomerate. Furthermore, SLP-76 also binds the kinase HPK1. These proximal events lead to the activation of the Ras-MAPK cascade and calcium flux, which culminate in gene transcription and initiation of effector functions. In addition, several mechanisms exist to downregulate these actions. Cbp is phosphorylated in the absence of activation. In this phosphorylated state, Cbp recruits the negative regulatory kinase, Csk. In addition, SLAP and SLAP-2 may bring c-Cbl in close proximity to Src and Syk family kinases, facilitating their degradation. (b) Unlike the highly processed peptides in complex with MHC molecules recognized by the TCR, the BCR recognizes soluble antigen. Despite these differences, there are striking similarities with regard to signaling through these immunoreceptors. Following BCR ligation, the src kinase Lyn is activated and phosphorylates ITAMs present in the Iga and Igb chains. Just as in T cells, these phosphorylated motifs recruit a Syk family kinase. One disparity, however, is that LAT is not expressed in B cells to recruit the SLP-76 family member BLNK to the membrane. Two current models for this recruitment exist that are not mutually exclusive; BLNK may be recruited by non-ITAM tyrosines on the Iga chain, or the LAT-like adaptor LAB may engage it. BLNK may then bring PLC-g2 into the complex, facilitating its subsequent activation and initiation of downstream signaling cascades.

show an attenuation of negative selection and stimulation-induced apoptosis. In addition, a reduction of Grb2 expression in T cells leads to diminished activation of Ras, Jnk and p38 MAPKs but normal Erk activation. Gong et al. [31] also demonstrate that these MAPKs require varied doses of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for maximal activation. It is possible that the observed effects are due to different activation thresholds among the MAPKs, which subsequently affect T-cell development and effector functions. In contrast to Grb2, Grap (for Grb2-related adaptor protein) probably functions in TCR signaling through downmodulation of Erk activation. T lymphocytes from Grap-deficient mice show increased proliferation and IL-2 production in response to TCR stimulation [32]. Another Grb2 family member, Gads, plays a positive role in lymphocyte activation. Similar to Grb2 and Grap, Gads contains an SH2 domain and two SH3 domains with an additional PR region (Figure 1). Its importance was underscored recently in Gads-deficient mice, as thymocyte proliferation and selection are severely impaired in these mice. In addition, the association of SLP-76 with
Current Opinion in Immunology 2003, 15:269­276

a protein of approximately 40 kDa, probably LAT, is significantly reduced [21]. The Grb2-related adaptor Shc contains an SH2 and a PTB domain. When phosphorylated by proximal tyrosine kinases, Shc interacts with the SH2 domain of Grb2. One of its functions is to enhance the interaction of Grb2 with Sos [33,34]. Similar to Gads and Grb2, Shc has an important function in pre-TCR signaling and thymocyte development, Shc-deficient thymocytes have a partial block in the transition to the CD4þCD8þ double-positive stage of development [35]. In addition, Shc-deficient Jurkat cells are unable to produce IL-2 in response to TCR stimulation. Shc is important in Erk activation as well as c-Rel nuclear translocation [36]. It is possible that Shc enhancement of the Grb2 and Sos interaction may be partly responsible for the high efficiency of Grb2 in Erk activation as noted above.

upregulation of CD69 in response to antigen receptor ligation [45]. A decrease in calcium flux as well as activation of NFAT and the IL-2 promoter can also be observed in Jurkat T cells overexpressing SLAP-2 [45­47]. Multiple explanations have been offered to explain the inhibitory effects of SLAP-2. As SLAP-2 resembles a Src kinase, it may sequester their normal Src binding partners through its SH2 domain [45]. Alternatively, these finding may be explained by the association of the carboxyl terminus of SLAP-2 with c-Cbl (for casitas B-lineage lymphoma;[45­47]). In addition to their adaptor functions, c-Cbl and Cbl-b have ring fingers and act as E3 ubiquitin ligases (reviewed in [48,49]). Recent reports have shown that the ubiquitin ligase activities of c-Cbl and Cblb play a role in the negative regulation of upstream kinases, such as Lck, Syk and PI3K, in T and B cells [50­54]. Consistent with this notion, the carboxyl terminus of SLAP-2 is necessary for its full inhibitory effect, and cotransfection of SLAP-2 with Syk family kinases leads to a dramatic reduction in kinase levels [46]. Thus, one potential scenario is that SLAP-2 acts as bridge between c-Cbl and proximal kinases directing their degradation. The function of the Cbl proteins may not be solely negative. Mice with T cells deficient in both c-Cbl and Cbl-b have an autoimmune phenotype with sustained T-cell activation. Although they exhibit an increase in ZAP-70 phosphorylation in comparison to wild-type mice, a decrease in PLC-g1 phosphorylation and calcium flux can be observed in the double-knockout T cells [55]. This finding is consistent with the observation that Cbl-b positively regulates the calcium-signaling pathway. Cbl-b-deficient DT40 B cells have reduced PLC-g2 activation [56]. Cbl-b may have both positive and negative regulatory function in T-cell activation.

Cbp (for csk-binding protein)/PAG (for phosphoprotein associated with glycolipid-enriched microdomains) is localized to lipid rafts and phosphorylated by the Src kinase Fyn [37,38]. It is believed that, in the absence of stimulation, phosphorylated Cbp recruits the kinase Csk to the vicinity of Src family kinases, where it phosphorylates negative regulatory residues [39]. In addition to its role in kinase regulation, Cbp is implicated in controlling immune synapse formation. In one model, Cbp binding to the newly identified adaptor EBP (also known as Naþ/Hþ exchangerregulatory factor [NHE-RF]) serves as a link in a `chain' between lipid rafts and the cytoskeleton. One function of this `chain' may be to retain the separateness of small lipid rafts under basal conditions. Correspondingly, overexpression of Cbp has been found to limit synapse formation with antigen stimulation whereas a mutant unable to bind EBP has no effect on synapse formation [40]. Cbp is a prime example of the multiple roles that adaptor proteins may take on to adjust the immune response.
LAX

We have characterized a novel membrane-associated adaptor related to LAT. Linker for activation of X cells (LAX) is expressed in hematopoietic cells and contains multiple tyrosine motifs that, when phosphorylated, bind Grb2, Gads and PI3K. Unlike LAT, LAX is not found in lipid rafts, and its overexpression in Jurkat T cells reduces p38 and AP-1 activation [41]. It remains to be seen how LAX preferentially inhibits p38 while Erk and Jnk activation remain normal. It is possible that LAX may act as a `sink', recruiting signaling molecules away from the LAT signaling complex in T cells.
SLAPs and Cbls

Similar to Cbp and LAX, SLAP (for Src-like adaptor protein) is also expressed in both B and T cells [42]. Although SLAP lacks a kinase domain, it has SH3 and SH2 domains as well as a unique carboxyl terminus. SLAP interacts with Cbl, LAT, ZAP-70, Syk and the TCRz chain in T cells [43]. Data from SLAP overexpression in Jurkat cells indicate that SLAP downregulates signals that lead to IL-2 production [42]. Thymocytes from SLAP-deficient mice have increased surface expression of the TCR and enhanced positive selection [44]. Several groups have identified a SLAP-related protein, designated SLAP-2 [45­47]. SLAP-2 contains a putative myristoylation site that is not only important for its membrane localization but also its inhibitory effects [45­47]. Overexpression of SLAP-2 in B and T cell lines diminishes

Dok (for downstream of tyrosine kinases) proteins are expressed in various hematopoietic cells and are implicated in the negative regulation of signaling through cytokine and immunoreceptors. These proteins contain PH, PTB, and PR domains as well as numerous tyrosines. In B cells, Dok-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated upon co-ligation of the BCR and FcgRIIB. Phosphorylated Dok-1 associates with RasGAP (for RasGTPase-activation protein), an interaction which is dependent on the phosphatase, SHIP (for SH2 domain-containing inositol 50 -phosphatase) [57]. Dok-1 also interacts with the SH2 domains of Nck, Csk, and the adaptor SAP (for SLAM-associated protein) [58,59]. Through these interactions Dok-1 is believed to downregulate the Ras-MAPK pathway. In addition, thymocytes, bone marrow and mast cells from Dok-1À/À mice show increased proliferation in response to stimulation [60]. These findings suggest an important role for Dok-1 in downmodulating the activation and proliferation responses of lymphocytes.
Current Opinion in Immunology 2003, 15:269­276

274 Lymphocyte activation

Another Dok family member, Dok-2, appears to play a role in the negative regulation of T-cell maturation and activation. T-cell proliferation in response to TCR ligation and cytokines is markedly enhanced in mice expressing only low levels of Dok-2 [61]. In addition, overexpression of Dok-2 in the bone marrow reduces its capacity to restore lymphoid tissues in irradiated hosts. Specifically, it inhibits the transition of CD4ÀCD8À to CD4þCD8þ T cells. Its RasGAP and Nck binding sites were found to be important for this activity [62]. Unlike Dok-1 and Dok-2, Dok-3 is not expressed in T cells and is unable to bind RasGAP [63]. It is found in B cells and phosphoryated with immunoreceptor ligation. When phosphorylated, Dok-3 binds SHIP and Csk [64]. In contrast to other family members, Dok-3 is unable to block MAPK activation caused by activated Ras; however, it does downregulate MAPK in response to expression of the Abl oncogene [63]. Also, when overexpressed in B cells, Dok-3 leads to a decrease in NFAT activation and cytokine secretion [64]. Recently, two new Dok family members have been identified, Dok-4 and Dok-5. Both are expressed in peripheral blood T cells. Interestingly, Dok-5 is found in activated and not resting T cells [65]. Perhaps its expression in activated cells correlates with an ability to downregulate cellular activation, similar to other Dok proteins.

Sommers et al. [12] establish that in CD4þ T cells there are alterations in PLC-g1 phosphorylation as well as downstream calcium flux and NFAT activation. Also, at later time points, these mice develop an autoimmune phenotype with polyclonal lymphoproliferation. There is an increase in the number of CD4þ T cells and eosinophils, and type II cytokine production [12,13].

They propose a model that, in an oxidizing environment, disulfide bonds form between cysteine residues in LAT, leading to a conformational change and subsequent membrane displacement. 16.

Conclusions
Recent developments in the field of adaptor proteins serve to highlight the importance of this group of proteins in lymphocyte activation. Many of these proteins have multiple roles and act in both positive and negative regulatory pathways. In addition, newly discovered interactions, together with the characterization of several novel adaptors, have significantly affected our current view of lymphocyte activation.

Mol Cell Biol 2001, 21:6102-6112. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the authors identify the kinase HPK1 as a binding partner for the SLP-76 family member, CLNK. Even though they are believed to have different sets of binding partners, CLNK is able to rescue signaling in SLP-76 deficient Jurkat T cells, perhaps because of its associate with HPK1. 25.

J Immunol 2002, 168:2127-2138. Both groups [27,28] show that two non-ITAM tyrosines (Tyr176,Tyr204) of the Iga chain are necessary for proper BLNK engagement. Using a chimeric receptor [28], they find that mutation of these tyrosines leads to impaired BLNK binding, PLC-g2 phosphorylation and calcium flux. These findings provide one explanation for BLNK membrane recruitment. 28.

Nat Immunol 2003, 4:117-123. This reference, together with [30] characterizes a new lipid-raft localized adaptor found in B cells and other cell types. LAB/NTAL associates with Grb2 and can partially compensate for a LAT deficiency in Jurkat T cells [30]. In addition, LAB can function in place of LAT, restoring thymocyte development in LAT knockout mice [29]. These papers support the notion that LAB partially functions like LAT in B cells. 30.

The authors examine T-cell signaling in Grb2 heterozygous mice. Similar to the sensitivity of MAPKs to activation with PMA, they find that decreased levels of Grb2 affect the various MAPKs differently. In turn, these differences lead to decreased negative selection leaving positive selection intact. This paper effectively illustrates the consequences that gene dosage may have on physiologic processes. 32.

J Immunol 2002, 168:541-544. The authors identify the Cbp binding protein EBP. They show that, when Cbp is overexpressed in cells, the reorganization of lipid rafts is impeded. This function appears to be dependent on the ability of Cbp to bind EBP. Therefore, they propose that the Cbp­EBP complex negatively regulates immune synapse formation. 41.

J Exp Med 2001, 194:1263-1276. Three groups [45­47] have identified a SLAP-related adaptor, SLAP-2. Overexpression of SLAP-2 in both T and B cells leads to a downmodulation of several signaling events, including calcium flux, NFAT activation and downstream IL-2 production. In addition, they determine that c-Cbl associates with the carboxyl terminus of SLAP-2. The C-terminal region of SLAP-2 is necessary for its inhibitory function, suggesting a role for the SLAP-2-c­Cbl complex in downregulating T- and B-cell function. 46.

The authors generate mice with T cells deficient in both c-Cbl and Cbl-b. These cells show persistent activation and surface TCR expression is not downregulated in response to stimulation. Trafficking of internalized TCR to the lysosomal compartment is impaired in the deficient T cells. In addition, although phosphorylation of ZAP-70 is increased, PLC-g1 phosphorylation is decreased.
