Cortical neurons were cultured from E17-E19 LongEvans rats as described (37), plated at a density of 1 106 cells per well of a 12-well plate (Falcon), and maintained for 4 to 6 days in Basal Medium Eagle (Sigma) containing 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% glucose. Cells were stimulated in Tyrodes solution containing 75 mM NaCl, 65 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Hepes, 10 mM glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, LTCs were blocked with 5 M nimodipine and 100 M diltiazem (racemic) (Sigma); P/Q- and N-type channels were blocked with 1 M -Agatoxin IVA, 1 M -Conotoxin GIVA, and 1 M -Conotoxin MVIIC (Alomone Labs). Blockers were usually added 30 min before stimulation. 5. A. J. Shaywitz, M. E. Greenberg, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 68, 821 (1999). 6. J. C. Chrivia et al., Nature 365, 855 (1993). 7. H. Bading, D. D.

For Western blots, cells were lysed in boiling SDS lysis buffer, separated by SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes before antibody staining. The following antibodies were purchased: anti­LTC 1C (Chemicon), anti­phospho-Erk Thr202/Tyr204 (Cell Signaling and Promega), anti-Erk1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-Xpress (Invitrogen).

Imaging was performed at 25° or 37°C, as indicated, on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse) equipped with a xenon arc lamp, an excitation filter wheel, and a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Open Lab software (Improvision) was used to collect and quantitate time-lapse excitation-ratio images. Ratio values were converted to [Ca2 ]i by using a standard curve of fura-2 ratio emission values as a function of Ca2 , measured in a cuvette on the microscope stage with calibrated EGTA/Ca2 solutions (Molecular Probes). 13.

The coding sequence for 1C derived from mammalian brain (RBCII) was a gift of T. Snutch. It was subcloned into the Topo-adapted pcDNA-4 vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis to generate the DHP-LTC, IQ, and EF mutants was performed with the QuickChange system (Stratagene) and was always followed by complete sequencing of the resulting channel. The EF hand mutations consisted of changing the VVTL motif at position 1548 with VYTL or MYTL. Full sequences of the primers and the constructs are available upon request. The CaMs with mutations in the Ca2 coordinating aspartate residues in the 1,2,3,4 and 2,3,4 EF hand domains were a gift from P. Adelman. They were subcloned into pcDNA-3 vectors for mammalian expression. 16. M. He, I. Bodi, G. Mikala, A. Schwartz, J. Biol. Chem 272, 2629 (1997). 17. Neuronal transfection was done by a modified Ca2 phosphate method, as described (36). Neurons were transfected with a 2 :1:1 ratio of 1C, 1b, and 2 LTC subunits. For immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were cotransfected with a ratio of 6 :1 channel subunits to green fluorescent protein (GFP). For luciferase assays, neurons were transfected with a ratio of 12:2:1 of channel subunits to CRE or MRE luciferase constructs and renilla luciferase driven by a thymidine kinase promoter as a transfection control. The CRE luciferase gene contains four copies of the somatostatin CRE upstream of firefly luciferase and is commercially available from Stratagene. The MRE luciferase construct contains three copies of the MRE upstream of firefly luciferase and was a gift of E. Olsen. Luciferase assays were performed 4 to 6 hours after stimulation with the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) and measured in duplicate on an automated luminometer (Lucy-2, Phoenix Research Products). Luciferase values are expressed either as raw ratios of firefly luciferase to renilla luciferase values (Figs. 4G and 5B) or as percent activation (Figs. 3C, 4A, and 5A) in which depolarization-induced activation of CRE-Luc or MRE-Luc in cells transfected with wild-type or mutant LTCs is normalized to the maximal reporter gene transcription in the transfected cells after depolarization in the absence of nimodipine. Transcription of the CRE-luciferase gene maximally increased 5- to 10-fold and the MRE luciferease gene 10- to 20-fold. 18. R. E. Westenbroek, L. Hoskins, W. A. Catterall, J. Neurosci. 18, 6319 (1998). 19. Immunocytochemistry was performed with standard protocols. GFP-transfected cells were scored for pCREB Ser133 or pERK Thr202 /Tyr204 staining in a double-blinded fashion and in some cases analyzed with a cooled CCD camera to measure fluorescence intensity. A total of 1000 to 1200 cells were counted per condition. Values are given as the percentage of transfected cells (GFP-positive) that are also phospho-CREB­ or phospho-Erk­positive. 20. A. Bonni, D.

Crystal Structure of the Extracellular Segment of Integrin V 3

Integrins are heterodimeric receptors that mediate divalent cation-dependent cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion through tightly regulated interactions with ligands. We have solved the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of integrin V 3 at 3.1 Å resolution. Its 12 domains assemble into an ovoid "head" and two "tails." In the crystal, V 3 is severely bent at a defined region in its tails, reflecting an unusual flexibility that may be linked to integrin regulation. The main intersubunit interface lies within the head, between a seven-bladed -propeller from V and an A domain from 3, and bears a striking resemblance to the G /G interface in G proteins. A metal ion­ dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the A domain is positioned to participate in a ligand-binding interface formed of loops from the propeller and A domains. MIDAS lies adjacent to a calcium-binding site with a potential regulatory function. Integrins are large heterodimeric cell surface receptors found in many animal species ranging from sponges to mammals [reviewed in (1)]. These receptors are involved in fundamental cellular processes such as attachment, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Integrins also contribute to the initiation and/or progression of many common diseases including neoplasia, tumor metastasis, immune dysfunction, ischemia-reperfu-

Table 1. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics. Methods are as follows: V 3 crystals belong to space group P3221, with unit cell dimensions of a b 130.0 Å, and c 307.3 Å. Each asymmetric unit contains a single heterodimer and 61% solvent. Crystals were cryoprotected in glycerol, and native and derivative data were collected at 100 K at ID-19 beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory. Data were processed with HKL (43). Heavy atom refinement and phase calculations were performed using SHARP (44), and phases were then improved using SOLOMON (45). A high degree of nonisomorphism between the Pt2 and Lu3 derivative data sets prevented phase combination, and so the polypeptide chain was traced using two separate electron density maps, one based on MAD phases (Lu3 ) and the other calculated with SIRAS phases (Pt2 ). Most of the main chain and many side chains could be recognized in these maps, with the exception of the PSI and the predicted EGF-1 and -2 domains of 3. Model building was carried out in O (46), and refinement was performed with XPLOR (47) using bulk solvent correction and simulated annealing protocols. After several rounds of refinement and model building into the resulting A-weighted electron density maps, atomic B-factor refinement (grouping residues) was carried out. The average B factor for the whole structure is 60 Å2. The average B factors for the individual domains are as follows: propeller, 47 Å2; thigh, 78 Å2; calf-1, 75 Å2; calf-2, 60 Å2; A domain, 56 Å2; hybrid, 68 Å2; EGF-3, 82 Å2; EGF-4, 66 Å2 and TD, 71 Å2.

cycle and gene expression [reviewed in (8)]. Unlike other receptors, however, ligand binding with integrins is not generally constitutive but is regulated to reflect the activation state of the cell. This "insideout" regulation of integrin affinity protects the host from pathological integrin-mediated adhesion (2). Inside-out and outside-in signaling are associated with distinct conformational changes in the integrin extracellular segment. These changes vary with cell type and the state and nature of the ligand, and are modulated by divalent cations that are also required for integrinligand interaction (9­11). The structural bases of activation and regulation of integrins are unknown. Previous attempts to address this question were limited to the structure determination of the ligand-binding, 180 ­amino acid A-type domain ( A) (12) present in one-half of the integrin subunits (13). The structural basis of ligand binding to A-lacking integrins and its regulation are unknown. One such integrin is V 3 (CD51/CD61), a receptor important in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, inflammation, and bone resorption [reviewed in (14 )]. V 3 is one of the most promiscuous integrins, as it binds to multiple ligands including vitronectin, angiostatin, and osteopontin, and also serves as a receptor for several viruses such as footand-mouth disease virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus [reviewed in (15)]. Here we report the crystal structure of the extracellular region of human V 3. The structure has both known and previously unknown domains with creative designs, and reveals unexpected quaternary arrangements that provide insights into integrin function and regulation. These studies also have major bearing on development of drugs to control angiogenesis, inflammation, viruses, and osteoporosis by targeting integrins.

Structure Determination and Refinement
Expression and purification of a soluble V 3 fragment, which terminates after Pro957 (in V) and Asp692 (in 3) and therefore lacks the transmembrane and short cytoplasmic tails of both subunits, was carried out essentially as described (16 ). Soluble V 3 displayed the same epitopes, ligand-binding specificities, and divalent cation requirements as the active form of native V 3 [(16 ) and data not shown]. Protein crystals were grown by vapor diffusion using 100 mM MES, pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 10 % polyethylene glycol 4000 as precipitant. The structure was solved with the use of single isomorphous replacement-anomalous scattering (SIRAS) and multiwave-

Contacts between the and subunits primarily involve their NH2-terminal halves [reviewed in (1)], which together form a globular head; the remaining portions form two rod-shaped tails (4­7) that span the plasma membrane. Like other receptors, integrins transmit signals to the cell interior (so-called "outside-in" signaling), which regulate organization of the cytoskeleton, activate kinase signaling cascades, and modulate the cell

Overall Structure of the Heterodimer
The NH2-terminal segments of the and subunits assemble into an ovoid "head" from which two nearly parallel "tails" emerge (Fig. 1, B and C). The head consists of a seven-bladed -propeller from V and a A domain looping out from a unique immunoglobulin (Ig)-like "hybrid" domain in 3. The integrin head has dimensions of 90 Å by 60 Å by 45 Å. The V tail is composed of three -sandwich domains: an Ig-like "thigh" domain and two very similar domains that form the "calf " module. The 3 tail consists of a PSI [for plexins, semaphorins, and integrins (18)] domain, four epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains,

and a -tail domain ( TD). The and integrin tails fold back at a 135° angle, forming a V-shaped structure with a "genu" between the thigh domain and the calf module of V. This profound bending of both subunits is surprising but unambiguous. When extended, each integrin tail forms a thin cylinder, 160 Å long and 20 Å in diameter. These values are in agreement with those derived from rotary shadowing images (4­7 ).

-propeller domain. The -propeller is formed from the NH2-terminal seven-fold 60 residue sequence repeats of V and consists of seven radially arranged "blades," each formed from a four-stranded antiparallel sheet (Fig. 2A). The inner strand (strand A) of each blade lines the channel at the center of the propeller, with strands B and C of the same repeat radiating

outward, and strand D of the next repeat forming the outer edge of the blade [Fig. 2A and Web fig. 2 (17)]. The -propeller is circularized by juxtaposition of the C7 and D1 strands. The central channel is lined predominantly with amide and carbonyl oxygen groups from the seven A strands, with only a few side chains projecting into the cavity. Superposition of the seven integrin blades reveals a unique consensus sequence repeat, the "cage" motif [Fig. 2, B through D, and Web fig. 2 (17)]. This motif (X17-33{ G X13-20PX2-15GX5-8})7, where X is any residue and is an aromatic residue) is defined by a mostly aromatic four-residue "cup" ( G ) that precedes strand A, a proline immediately following strand B (ProB), and a glycine at the beginning of strand C (Gly-C). The first and fourth residues of the cup form the upper and lower rings of a cage-like structure that lies at the center of the contact region between V and 3, holding Arg261 of 3 in place (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2, C and D). The second and third residues form the floor of the cup. Pro-B introduces an acute turn and is tightly sandwiched between sequential cups, providing a rigid scaffold for the upper and lower ring residues. Pro-B is replaced with Phe427 in blade 7, pushing the side chains of the lower ring residues Phe21 and Tyr 406 toward Arg261 (Fig. 2C). The small side chains of the lower ring residues Ala96 and Ser342 are required to avoid clashes in this region. Gly-C is required because any side chain at this position would interfere with Pro-B. Four solvent-exposed Ca2 -binding sites are found in the A-B hairpin loops of blades 4-7 at the propeller's bottom (opposite

the interface) [see metal coordination in Web fig. 3 (17)]. The calcium-binding residues span a nine-residue segment with the consensus sequence Asp-h-Asp/Asn-x-Asp/ Asn-Gly-h-x-Asp, where "h" is hydrophobic and "x" is any residue; the invariant Gly is required because of its unusual main chain torsion angles. Ca2 is usually coordinated by oxygen atoms from side chains of residues 1, 3, 5, and 9 and the carbonyl oxygen of residue 7. Sequential hairpin loops contact each other in a chain-like arrangement. The calcium-containing loop of blade seven makes extensive contacts with the thigh domain; the presence of calcium is likely to make this interface more rigid. sandwich domains. The remainder of V consists of the thigh and calf-1 and -2 domains [Fig. 1C and Web fig. 4 (17)]. The sheet structure of the thigh domain is similar in topology to the C2-set Ig fold (19), although the thigh domain is significantly larger. The contact area between the propeller and thigh domains buries a 700 Å2 surface area. The elongated shape and intermediate size of this interface suggest that some interdomain movement, likely as a rotation around the long axis of the contact area, is possible. Such movement could be regulated by calcium ions in the propeller. Each calf domain contains two antiparallel sheets, one with four strands (ABGD) and the other with five (EFCHI). The two domains are related by an approximate twofold screw axis symmetry. The known proteolytic cleavage site after Arg860, which generates the heavy and light chains of V, is located in the EE loop of the calf-2 domain. The residues flanking the cleavage site

(Gln839­Gly867) are not seen in the electron density map and are presumably disordered. A small 200 Å2 interface exists in the crystal at the genu between the thigh and calf-1 domains. The base of the thigh domain and the top of the calf-1 domain both contain acidic patches, and these would be expected to face each other in an extended integrin. A well-coordinated calcium ion lies at the genu; in an extended structure it may help to neutralize the negative charge at this interface. The 500 Å2 interface between calf-1 and -2 domains is fairly extensive and largely hydrophobic, suggesting that these two domains form a rigid structural entity, the calf module.

3 Subunit Domains
A and hybrid domains. The 3 portion of the integrin head is composed of the A and hybrid domains (Fig. 1C). The A domain (Fig. 3A) is inserted into the B-C loop of the hybrid domain [Fig. 1C and Web fig. 5 (17)] and assumes the nucleotide-binding (or Rossmann) fold found in G and integrin A domains (13). The A domain consists of a central six-stranded sheet surrounded by eight helices. A MIDAS motif occupies a crevice at the top of the central strand, as in A domains (13). 3 MIDAS is formed by the side chains of Asp119, Ser121, Ser123, Glu220 (equivalent to Thr 209 in A of CD11b), and Asp251 (equivalent to Asp242 in A of CD11b) (Fig. 3B). Thus, the overall geometry of the metal-ligand coordination is similar to that of A. However, we do not clearly see a metal ion in 3 MIDAS: although there is a density feature present, it likely represents a water molecule or a metal ion with partial occupancy. Adjacent to MIDAS lies a metal ion­ binding site (ADMIDAS) (Fig. 3C). We assigned a calcium ion at ADMIDAS because calcium is present in the crystallization buffer and because the ion is octahedrally coordinated. In addition, the ion can be replaced by the calcium analog Lu3 in the derivatized crystal. Calcium is coordinated by the carbonyl oxygens of Ser123 (from A - 1 loop) and Met335 (from 7) and by the side chains of Asp126 and Asp127 (from 1) (Fig. 3C), thus linking 1 to the top of 7. Asp126 and Asp127 are invariant in all A domains except that of 8, where they are both replaced with asparagines. A exists in two conformations, "open" and "closed" (20, 21), corresponding to "high" and "low" affinity states, respectively (22, 23). It has been suggested that both forms are present in an equilibrium, with a switch from the "closed" to the "open" state being a necessary feature of activation in A-integrins (22). The "closed" and "open" conformations are distinguished primarily by the length and relative position of helix 7. In the "closed" form, 7 has an extra NH2terminal turn and is tethered to the domain

body through hydrophobic contacts that include insertion of a conserved isoleucine (I316 in A of CD11b) from 7 into the socketfor-isoleucine (SILEN) (23). Removal of this contact shifts 7 by 10 Å, switching A to the "open" high-affinity form. Except for the two insertions in the B-C and D- 5 loops, the A domain is largely superimposable on that of A. However, 7 of the A domain is more similar to 7 in the "open" state of A: it lacks an extra turn at its top (Fig. 3D) and is positioned similarly relative to the body of the domain (Fig. 3E). Both features suggest that the A domain is "open" in our V 3 structure, though it is not liganded. The NH2- and COOH-termini connecting the A domain to the hybrid domain appear to be rigidly held in place through numerous contacts with the hybrid domain, suggesting that the A domain, in contrast to A, always exists in the "open" state and may, therefore, be regulated differently. The hybrid domain (Fig. 1, B and C) is similar to the I-set Ig domains (19). Its core most closely resembles that of the I-set domain 1 of CD102 [see Web fig. 5 (17)]. The hybrid and A domains make extensive contacts with each other. The A domain­ hybrid interface is circular (diameter, 15 Å), fairly large (650 Å2), and has a mixed hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature. Its architecture and size suggest that interdomain movement across the A domain­ hybrid interface is minimal. PSI domain. On the basis of sequence homology, the NH2-terminal 54 amino acids of 3 are predicted to fold into a PSI domain (18), located in the region connecting the hybrid domain to the expected EGF-1 domain (Fig. 1, B and C). The electron density for PSI is weak, and its C chain cannot be traced with certainty at the current resolution. Thus, the PSI domain is not included in the present model, although the nature of the electron density suggests that it is partially ordered. EGF domains. Four tandem cysteine-rich repeats follow the hybrid domain in the primary sequence. Good electron density allowed us to build a model for cysteine-rich repeats 3 and 4 [Fig. 1, B and C, and Web fig. 6 (17)]. Each assumes the structure of a class I EGF fold (24) and contains the three disulfide bonds typical for EGF domains. An additional pair of cysteines links the two domains. EGF-4 contains an extra disulfide bridge that helps define the COOH-terminal boundary of the short D strand. EGF-3 and -4 form a rod-like, extended module in which the two domains are related by an approximate two-fold screw axis symmetry (Fig. 1C). A consensus site found in calcium binding (cb) EGF domains such as fibrillin (24) is lacking in the integrin EGF domains, and there is no evidence in our electron density map for calcium (or heavy atom) binding. A small ( 200 Å2 ), but presumably rigid, interface exists between EGF-3 and -4: it includes the disulfide bridge as well as main chain hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and a glycan. The electron density is not sufficiently featured to trace the predicted EGF-1 and -2 domains. Most likely, these domains are partially disordered because of the severe bending of the integrin in this region. Examination of their sequence [Web fig. 6 (17)] shows, however, that EGF-1 and -2 are highly homologous to EGF-3 and -4; each is expected to contain the typical three cysteine pairs and to lack the metal ion site found in cbEGF domains. Thus, EGF-1 and -2 are also likely to form a non­calciumbinding rod-shaped module. TD. TD consists of a four-stranded sheet that contains antiparallel and parallel helix strands and faces an NH2-terminal (Fig. 1C). Interactions between the helix and the sheet are mostly hydrophobic and involve a disulfide bond [see Web fig. 7 (17)]. The rear of the sheet is covered with a long A-B loop. A DALI search (25) showed only a weak homology to cystatin C, an inhibitor of the papain-family cysteine proteases (26). However, the TD structure differs from that of cystatin C in the direction of one of the strands in the sheet. Hence TD has to be classified as a new fold. Only two weak hydrophobic contacts are found between TD and EGF-4, suggesting flexibility at this interface.

The V 3 Interface
The A domain­propeller interface bears a striking resemblance to the G -G interface of G proteins (Fig. 4). The seven-bladed propellers of V and G have similar dimensions, and they also have almost identical orientations of the strands with respect to the central channel (Fig. 4). Furthermore, both A and G domains rest off-center with respect to the propellers, and in each case contact six of the seven blades. In both cases, the axis of the propeller's channel is aimed directly at a short helix: the 310- and 2helices of A and G domains, respectively (Fig. 4). In the case of G , the 2-helix

marks switch region II, which undergoes a major conformational change upon activation of G proteins. Residue Arg261 lies at the core of the A domain­propeller interface (Fig. 1A, Fig. 2, C and D, and Fig. 5). Arg261 (Lys in all other integrin subunits except 4) protrudes offcenter into the propeller's channel, and is caged into place by two concentric rings of predominantly aromatic propeller residues (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2, C and D). Residues in the upper and lower rings lie at positions 1 and 4, respectively, of the seven cups in V (Fig. 2, B and C). Side chains of Phe21, Phe159, Tyr 224, Phe278, and Tyr 406 form the lower ring and contact Arg261 directly (Fig. 2C). Some of these contacts occur through cation- bonding (27). Residues Tyr18, Trp93, Tyr 221, Tyr 275, and Ser 403 in the upper ring (Fig. 2D) contact side chains in the lower ring and also provide a hydrophobic interface for residues flanking Arg261 in the 310-helix. The A domain­propeller interface has a number of additional contacts (Fig. 5) and buries a large surface area of 1600 Å2. Naturally occurring mutations that disrupt the heterodimer in integrins have been described [reviewed in (2, 28)]. These occur most frequently in the A domain of 2 and 3 integrin subunits, resulting in life-threatening bacterial infections and thrombasthenia (a severe bleeding disorder), respectively. Our model helps explain how such mutations cause disruption of the heterodimer. For example, Gly251 to Arg or Pro156 to Leu mutations are known to prevent formation of 2 integrin heterodimers. Gly260 in 3 (corresponding to Gly251 in 2) lies in the 310-helix next to Arg261, which makes the central contact with the propeller (Fig. 2, C and D). A Gly to Arg substitution here would result in clashes with other A residues and would likely alter the position of the 310 helix relative to the propeller. Pro163 in 3 (equivalent to Pro156 of 2) lies in a loop adjacent to the 310-helix and contacts the propeller (Fig. 5); the longer leucine side chain would disrupt the interface. In 3, a Ser162 to Leu mutation results in an unstable IIb 3 heterodimer and causes thrombasthenia. Ser162 lies above blade 2 of the propeller; replacing it with leucine would result in unfavorable contacts at the interface. Although the propeller­ A domain interface is the main contact between the V and 3 subunits, in the crystal, additional contacts are seen between the propeller­EGF-3 and -4 domains, thigh­EGF-3, calf-2­EGF-4, and calf-2­ TD. All these contacts are small, not very hydrophobic, and for the most part discontinuous. Therefore, they are not expected to occur in the membrane-bound receptor. conformation. This arrangement differs dramatically from the extended conformations seen in cryoelectron microscopy images of integrins reconstituted in lipid bilayers (7) or rotary shadowing of isolated integrins (4­6). However, a minority of rotary shadowing images suggests that the tails may have collapsed on top of (or beneath) the head (5, 6). The dimensions of this oblong form (120 Å by 80 Å) agree nicely with our structure, suggesting that similar bending may occur in solution. The fact that extended and severely bent conformations of the same molecule are seen suggests that a highly flexible site, the genu, exists in the integrin. The extreme degree of bending found in the crystal structure is less likely to occur in a membraneanchored integrin because such a conformation would likely constrain access of polymerized extracellular matrix to the ligand-binding site. Nevertheless, the high degree of flexibility at the genu provides a first glimpse of the spectrum of the quaternary changes possible during bi-directional signaling in integrins. The presence of a metal ion at the genu suggests one mechanism by which these changes could be regulated. The structural similarities between the propeller­ A domains and the G -G domains are intriguing (Fig. 4). In G proteins, GTP hydrolysis induces a major conformational shift in G , a component of which is the destabilization of the 2-helix in switch region II. This results in physical separation of the two subunits in the active state and unmasks ligandbinding sites on the propeller (33). Does the structural homology between integrins and G proteins translate into analogous models of allosteric control? A large interface between the propeller and A domains is seen in our structure, in contrast to G proteins where in the active state, the equivalent G and G are completely dissociated. Other observations suggest, however, that the propeller­ A domain contact area may also be a dynamic interface that can be modulated. First, integrin IIb 3 can be reversibly dissociated into its individual subunits by brief treatment with EDTA (34). Second, a conformational shift of the propeller relative to the A domain has been reported (32). Third, a split of the IIb 3 head into two distinct knobs was observed in the presence of RGD peptides (11). In our structure, cationbonding between Arg261 and surrounding aromatic residues contributes to the interface. Amide-aromatic interactions can be attractive or repulsive (27), unlike ion pairs. Thus, it is conceivable that small changes in side chain orientation could modulate the stability of the interface, perhaps allowing for dissociation under certain conditions. The location of the metal ion­ binding sites in V 3 helps clarify some of the complex and unresolved regulatory effects exerted by metal ions on integrin-ligand binding. Cells expressing a mutant 4 1 (lacking one

Implications for Integrin Function and Regulation
The structure described in this communication is that of V 3 in its active (ligand-competent) state. Activation in this case is artificially induced by truncating the transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments that normally restrain integrins into a default low-affinity state (29, 30). Naturally occurring 3 mutants (from some patients with thrombasthenia) and mutagenesis studies of the related integrin IIb 3 [reviewed in (1, 31)] identified three ligand-binding regions. Two of these are located in the IIb propeller and the third involves the A domain MIDAS. The A domain also contains a fourth "ligand specificity" region. Replacing this region in 1 with that of 3 switched ligandbinding specificity of integrin V 1 into that of V 3 [reviewed in (1, 31)]. The two 3 regions and the V residues that correspond to the two regions identified in IIb cluster at the top of the integrin head (Fig. 6). We propose that ligand binding occurs in this area. Confirmatory evidence comes from rotary-shadowed preparations where fibrinogen is found associated with the top of IIb 3 (6). The putative V 3 ligand-binding site is formed primarily by residues in loops D3-A3 (between blades 2 and 3) and B3-C3 (within blade 3) of the propeller and by residues in loop B-C and the MIDAS motif of the A domain. The A domain loops out from the COOH-terminal end of the D3-A3 loop in A-integrins. Major conformational changes throughout the subunit and reorientation of the extracellular domains of the and subunits appear to coincide with integrin activation, whether induced physiologically or artificially (9, 32). Our crystal structure reveals a severely bent V 3

or more metal-binding sites in the propeller) detach easily from substrate under shear flow (35). The calcium ions in the propeller are not close to the proposed ligand-binding site shown in Fig. 6, but they may help to make more rigid the propeller-thigh interface and may thus regulate integrin-ligand interactions in an allosteric manner. The calcium ion at the thigh­calf-1 interface may play a similar role. Studies with 3 and 5 1 integrins have also shown that a high-affinity Ca2 site is required for ligand-binding, and that a lowaffinity Ca2 site allosterically inhibits ligand binding (36, 37). The presence of two adjacent metal-binding sites (MIDAS and ADMIDAS) in the A domain suggests underlying mechanisms for these effects. The structure of V 3 reveals new domains, previously unpredicted domains, and creative use of the Ig scaffold. Integrin-ligand interactions are regulated not only by changes in affinity but also by altered avidity (receptor clustering) [reviewed in (38)]. Integrins also bind in cis to several membrane receptors, an interaction that modulates their signaling functions [reviewed in (39)]. The mosaic of domains revealed in the integrin structure can now serve as a foundation for future investigations into the structural basis of these interactions.

Oxygen Isotopes and the Moon-Forming Giant Impact
U. Wiechert,1 A. N. Halliday,1 D.-C. Lee,1 G. A. Snyder,2 L. A. Taylor,2 D. Rumble3
We have determined the abundances of 16O, 17O, and 18O in 31 lunar samples from Apollo missions 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17 using a high-precision laser fluorination technique. All oxygen isotope compositions plot within 0.016 per mil (2 standard deviations) on a single mass-dependent fractionation line that is identical to the terrestrial fractionation line within uncertainties. This observation is consistent with the Giant Impact model, provided that the protoEarth and the smaller impactor planet (named Theia) formed from an identical mix of components. The similarity between the proto-Earth and Theia is consistent with formation at about the same heliocentric distance. The three oxygen isotopes ( 17O) provide no evidence that isotopic heterogeneity on the Moon was created by lunar impacts. The Moon is generally considered to have formed from the debris produced in a collision between the proto-Earth and a Marssized impactor (1, 2). Assuming this Giant Impact model to be correct, materials from the proto-Earth, the impactor [named Theia (3)], and any additional material added to the Moon after the impact may have introduced isotopic heterogeneity as a consequence of collision and reaccretion. To test for inherent

isotopic heterogeneity in the Moon, we searched for small isotopic variations in oxygen. The existing 17O data of three anorthosites, one dunite, one green glass clod, three mineral analyses of a single basalt, and six soil samples from the Apollo missions (4) and nine lunar meteorites (5) range from ­ 0.204 to 0.094 per mil () (Fig. 1). This large range of 0.3 might be because the Moon was not homogeneous, either due to incomplete mixing of material from the proto-Earth and Theia or addition of material to the Moon after the Giant Impact. Here we report the results of new analyses of 16O, 17O and 18O for 31 lunar rocks with the use of a
