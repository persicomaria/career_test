Introduction The increasing resistance of clinically important pathogens to antibiotic treatment is of world-wide concern.1 New antibacterial agents that operate with distinctly different mechanisms of action from current drug therapies offer hope towards combating these multidrug-resistant organisms.2 In an effort to develop a novel class of antibacterial compounds, we targeted the inhibition of bacterial fatty acid synthesis (FAS-II). The FAS-II elongation cycle utilizes several discrete monofunctional enzymes with activity corresponding to individual polypeptides effecting fatty acid chain elongation and ultimately cell membrane production.3 Enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) is the component of FAS-II that catalyzes the final reaction in the enzymatic sequence.4 In contrast, mammalian fatty acid synthesis (FAS-I) employs a multifunctional enzyme complex in which all enzymatic activities reside on a single polypeptide.5 Thus, there exists a potential for selective inhibition of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial cell growth by the inhibition of the FabI enzyme. Herein, we describe the SAR of a series of 2,9-disub-

stituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-b]indoles that exhibit antibacterial activity by inhibiting the FabI enzyme. We also report compounds tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative FabI-containing organisms.6 Triclosan, a commercial antibacterial agent, has recently been shown to inhibit FabI7 and will be discussed in context with these results.

Chemistry The FabI inhibitor 3 was synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. Carbobenzyloxy (Z) protection of commercially available 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9H-pyrido[3,4b]indole (1, Scheme 1) in quantitative yield followed by N-9 alkylation using sodium hydride and 4-benzyloxybenzyl chloride in DMF gave 2 (92% yield). Hydrogenolysis in methanol using Pd(OH)2 at 45 psi and subsequent EDC-mediated acylation afforded compound 3 in 82% overall yield. Compounds 6­15 and 19­ 34 were likewise prepared with yields ranging from 72 to 90%. The regioisomeric derivative 16 was generated from 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and elaborated in the manner described in Scheme 1. Indole 18 was similarly constructed from Z-protected 2-(methylaminomethyl)indole. The racemic compound 17 was

the lowest concentration of compound that inhibited visible growth.

Results and Discussion Benzodiazepine 4 was identified as a weak lead compound (IC50=7.8 mM) from high throughput screening of our compound collection against S. aureus FabI. The key pharmacophore (IC50=2.7 mM) was determined to be 2-benzoyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (5).

Scheme 1. Preparation of 2,9-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-b]indoles. Reagents: (a) Z-succinamide, Et3N, DMF; (b) NaH, 4-benzyloxybenzyl chloride, rt; (c) Pd(OH)2, 1 M HCl in dioxane, H2 (3 atm), CH3OH, rt; (d) 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, EDC, HOBt, DMF, rt.

synthesized in 89% isolated yield by the reaction of tyramine and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde in a Pictet­Spengler condensation followed by acylation with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Biology The Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus FabI's were cloned, overexpressed and purified as described previously.8a FabI enzyme inhibition assays were carried out in half-area, 96-well microtitre plates. Compounds were evaluated in 150-mL assay mixtures containing 100 mM NaADA, pH 6.5 (ADA=N-[2acetamido]-2-iminodiacetic acid), 4% glycerol, 0.25 mM crotonoyl CoA, 50 mM NADH, and an appropriate dilution of E. coli Fab I (usually 60 nM). Inhibitors were typically varied over the range of 0.01­10 mM. The consumption of NADH was monitored for 20 min at 30  C by following the change in absorbance at 340 nm (e=5.28 mMÀ1). Initial velocities were estimated from an exponential fit of the nonlinear progress curves represented by the slope of the tangent at t=0 min. IC50's were estimated from a fit of the initial velocities to a standard, four-parameter model and are typically reported as the mean Æ SD of duplicate determinations. Triclosan, an inhibitor of Fab I, was included in all assays as a positive control. IC50's with S. aureus FabI were determined similarly except that NADPH was used as substrate, and the concentration of enzyme was typically 100 nM. Whole-cell antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:10 in water to produce a 256 mg/ mL stock solution. The stock solution was serially diluted using a Microlab AT Plus 2 (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV, USA) into cation adjusted Mueller­Hinton broth (Becton Dickenson, Cockeysville, MD, USA) on a 96well microtitre plate. After dilution, a 50 mL aliquot of the test isolate ($ 1Â106 cfu/mL) was added to each well of the microtitre plate. The final test concentrations ranged from 0.06 to 64 mg/mL. Inoculated plates were incubated at 35  C in ambient air for 18­24 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as

Initial investigation focused on substitution at the N-9 position of the b-carboline subunit (Table 1). paraHydroxybenzoyl was chosen as the N-2 acyl component because of its increased aqueous solubility relative to the benzoyl moiety of 5. Increased inhibition of both S. aureus and E. coli FabI was observed for 4-substituted benzyl analogues, with the 4-hydroxybenzyl compound 3 exhibiting the greatest potency. Basic (12) and acidic (15) substituents on the benzyl ring were less well tolerated. Further modifications to the most potent analogue 3 were subsequently investigated (Fig. 1). Regioisomer 16 and phenolic analogue 17 lost potency relative to 3. Eliminating the conformational constraint afforded by the 4-methylene position of the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-b]indole framework afforded compound 18. Although this compound showed an improvement in activity over 16 and 17, it was still significantly less active than the parent compound 3. Additional alterations to the tricyclic structure were unsuccessful in defining a more potent template.

Figure 1. Effects of structural modifications to 3 on S. aureus FabI enzyme activity.

An investigation into substitution at N-2 of the b-carboline revealed that an aromatic acyl group at this position was required for FabI enzyme activity (data not shown). A simple one-dimensional, solution-phase array consisting of 9-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-b]indole and various substituted benzoic acids was prepared to rapidly determine the

optimum substitution pattern on the benzoyl ring (Table 2). The SAR revealed that maximum inhibition of S. aureus and E. coli FabI generally occurred when a small lipophilic or hydroxyl group was located at the 4-position of the benzamide ring. Compounds with two substituents in this ring maintained activity against both enzymes (30­33). Three or more substituents on the ring (34­36) led to a loss of FabI activity, possibly due to unfavorable steric interactions. It was also observed that small increases in substituent size decreased potency, especially in E. coli (20 vs 21 and 25 vs 26). A comparison of the S. aureus enzyme inhibition of 3 with that of triclosan reveals that compound 3 is 10 times more active against this specific enzyme. Conversely, triclosan is 10fold more potent than 3 against the E. coli enzyme. These differences may be attributed to the time-dependent formation of a stable FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex in E. coli8 as compared to the highly reversible binding activity characterized by the b-carboline inhibitors. Differences in the binding site conformations of E. coli and S. aureus could also contribute to these disparities in potency. The X-ray co-crystallization study of 3 bound to E. coli FabI/NAD+ assists in the interpretation of the b-carboline SAR (Fig. 2).9 Although the full inhibitor has not been observed, the 4-hydroxybenzamide portion of the molecule is well ordered, and the data shows that the inhibitor is bound in the active site of the enzyme. The benzamide moiety of the inhibitor is surrounded by lipophilic residues in which Tyr 146 appears to participate in an orthogonal p-stacking interaction with the aromatic ring. The 4-hydroxy substituent on the ring is closely flanked by Met 206 and Phe 203 which may

Each compound in Table 3 was tested against a FabI over-expressing strain of S. aureus. Thus, if FabI is an antibacterial target of a compound, an increase in MIC relative to the wild type strain would be expected. MIC values for the compounds in Table 3 showed increases of 4- to > 16-fold, supporting that the mechanism of action does indeed involve FabI inhibition.

Conclusion We have identified potent inhibitors of S. aureus enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) that also demonstrate whole-cell antimicrobial activity in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. References and Notes

account for the steric effects observed in Table 2. The carbonyl oxygen of inhibitor 3 is apparently involved in a hydrogen bonding interaction to the 20 -ribose hydroxyl of NAD+ and to the hydroxyl group of Tyr 156 (dashed orange lines). This particular active-site interaction is analogous to that reported for Triclosan in which a phenol hydroxyl functions in a similar capacity.8 Selected compounds with submicromolar S. aureus enzyme activity were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against S. aureus Oxford, Moraxella catarrhalis 1502 and E. coli 7623 AcrABEFD+ organisms (Table 3). The MICs against S. aureus ranged from 0.5 to 4.0 (mg/mL) and corresponded well with FabI enzyme inhibition. Antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative M. catarrhalis strain was observed for the hydroxyl containing compounds (3, 27, and 30­33). While antibacterial activity was not observed against E. coli, this was expected due to the relatively poor E. coli FabI enzyme activity of these compounds. The MIC values of triclosan were lower than we would have predicted based on the corresponding IC50 levels. The high level of in vitro potency for triclosan may be the consequence of having multiple cellular targets,10 and therefore MICs may not be exclusively attributable to FabI inhibition.
