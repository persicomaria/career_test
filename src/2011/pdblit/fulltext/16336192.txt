The digestion of the plant cell wall requires the concerted action of a diverse repertoire of enzyme activities. An important component of these hydrolase consortia are arabinofuranosidases, which release L-arabinofuranose moieties from a range of plant structural polysaccharides. The anaerobic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum, a highly efficient plant cell wall degrader, possesses a single -L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55), CtAraf51A, located in GH51 (glycoside hydrolase family 51). The crystal structure of the enzyme has been solved in native form and in `Michaelis' complexes with both -1,5-linked arabinotriose and -1,3 arabinoxylobiose, both forming a hexamer in the asymmetric unit. Kinetic studies reveal that CtAraf 51A, in contrast with well-characterized GH51 enzymes including the Cellvibrio japonicus enzyme

[Beylot, McKie, Voragen, Doeswijk-Voragen and Gilbert (2001) Biochem. J. 358, 607­614], catalyses the hydrolysis of -1,5linked arabino-oligosaccharides and the -1,3 arabinosyl side chain decorations of xylan with equal efficiency. The paucity of direct hydrogen bonds with the aglycone moiety and the flexible conformation adopted by Trp178 , which stacks against the sugar at the + 1 subsite, provide a structural explanation for the plasticity in substrate specificity displayed by the clostridial arabinofuranosidase. Key words: arabinan, arabinofuranosidase, Clostridium thermocellum, glycosidase, ligand specificity, xylan.

INTRODUCTION

The plant cell wall is a complex composite of structural polysaccharides that represents the most abundant source of organic molecules in the biosphere. The annual recycling of 1011 tons of plant structural polysaccharides is an important biological process that is integral to the carbon cycle. Indeed, enzymes, such as xylanases, cellulases, pectinases and mannanases, which play a key role in plant cell wall recycling, are already used in biotechnological processes in the paper/pulp, fruit juice, detergent and textile sectors (some examples include [1,2]). The exploitation of the plant cell wall as an environmentally renewable energy source, estimated to equate to 600 billion barrels of oil, represents the major industrial application of this complex macromolecular structure. In this process, the plant cell wall is hydrolysed by microbial enzymes to its composite sugars, which are then used as cheap substrates in industrial fermentations to generate `biofuel' ethanol [3]. The complete saccharification of the plant cell wall requires an extensive repertoire of hydrolytic enzymes that include both the endo-acting enzymes described above and an extensive range of exo-acting glycosidases. Pectins and hemicelluloses, which comprise the major matrix polysaccharides in the plant cell wall, are extensively decorated with arabinofuranose moieties. Exo-acting -L-arabinofuranosidases hydrolyse terminal and side chain arabinofuranosides in arabinan (-1,5-linked arabinofuranosides), and the arabinosyl decorations within arabinogalactan and arabinoxylan (decorated at the C-2 and C-3 position) [4] (Figure 1). Arabinofuranosidases are located in the sequence-based GHs (glycoside hydrolase families; defined in [5,6] and recently reviewed in [7]) GH3, GH43, GH51, GH54 and GH62. The different families display widely varying specificity, although the paucity of characterized

members makes generalization difficult. For example, GH51 and GH54 arabinofuranosidases have been shown to remove both 1,2 and -1,3 arabinofuranosyl moieties from arabinan and xylans [8], the GH43 enzymes hydrolyse -1,5-linked arabinofuranooligosaccharides, while GH62 glycoside hydrolases display absolute specificity for arabinoxylans [9­13]. At the structural level, there is a single -L-arabinofuranosidase structure, the Geobacillus stearothermophilus enzyme from family GH51 [14]. This structure revealed a functional hexamer with each constituent monomer displaying a `clan GH-A' [15] catalytic (/)8 domain linked to a C-terminal 12-stranded -barrel. Clostridium thermocellum is an anaerobic thermophilic soil bacterium that displays a spectrum of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. The vast majority of the cell wall-degrading glycosidases from this organism are arranged on to a mega-Dalton supramolecular assembly termed the cellulosome (recently reviewed in [16]). The bacterium, however, also synthesizes intracellular glycoside hydrolases whose function is to hydrolyse oligosaccharides released from the plant cell wall by the cellulosome. One such enzyme is the GH51 arabinofuranosidase, hereafter termed CtAraf 51A. Here, we report the characterization of CtAraf 51A, cloned from genomic DNA, and its three-dimensional structures in native form and in `Michaelis' complexes, of an inactive mutant form of CtAraf 51A, with A3 (-1,5-linked arabinotriose) and AX2 (-1,3-linked arabinoside of xylobiose; derived from xylanase breakdown of arabinoxylan). It is shown that CtAraf 51A is equally efficient at removing the side chain decoration of AX2 (xylobiose in which the non-reducing xylose is decorated with arabinofuranose at O-3) as it is in hydrolysing the backbone of A3, an unusual specificity which is discussed in light of the three-dimensional complexes of the enzyme.

The cells were harvested by centrifugation and His6 tagged recombinant proteins were purified from cell-free extracts by IMAC (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography) following a 15 min heat denaturation step at 70 C. For crystallization, CtAraf 51A was further purified by gel filtration.

EXPERIMENTAL Expression and purification of Ct Araf 51 and mutant derivatives

Escherichia coli strains NovoBlue and BL21 DE3 (Novagen) were cultured at 37 C in LB (Luria­Bertani) broth. Media were supplemented with 50 mg/l kanamycin. The open reading frame encoding CtAraf 51A was amplified from a Cl. thermocellum ATCC 27405 genomic DNA template by PCR using the forward and reverse primers: CACCACCACCACATGAAAAAAGCCAGAATGACCGTTGACAAAGATTATAAAATTGCC and GAGGAGAAGGCGCGTTATTATTTACCTATCCGAATTACATTCCAAGAGGCTCTGCGAAG respectively. These were designed to incorporate LIC (ligation-independent cloning) and compatible sequence and the resultant 1542 bp product annealed into vector ysblLIC pET28a to produce the expression construct pGH51. This construct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech) and found to be identical with the known genomic sequence for the Cl. thermocellum araf51a gene (> gi|29341675). The pGH51 expression construct provided a template for site-directed mutagenesis to produce the acid/base D175A mutant. Specific primers: forward: GGTGTCTTGGCAATGAAATGGACGGTCCG reverse: CGGACCGTCCATTTCATTGCCAAGACACC were used in conjunction with the `Quick Change' mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Conformation of correct mutagenesis was obtained by DNA sequencing. CtAraf 51A protein was produced in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells harbouring the appropriate recombinant plasmid, cultured in LB broth containing kanamycin at 37 C. Cells were grown to midexponential phase [A550 (absorbance) of 0.7], at which point isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the cultures were incubated for a further 14 h

Assays were carried out using either PNP-Araf (4-nitrophenyl-L-arabinofuranoside; Sigma), 3 -O-arabinofuranosyl-xylobiose, 3 -O-arabinofuranosyl-xylotriose or 3 -O-arabinofuranosyl-xylotriose and the Megazyme International products arabinobiose, wheat arabinoxylan, sugar beet arabinan and linear arabinan. The arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides were prepared by treating arabinoxylan with a GH10 xylanase either partially, to generate 3 O-arabinofuranosyl-xylotriose, or to completion to produce 3 -O-arabinofuranosyl-xylobiose and 3 -O-arabinofuranosyl-xylotriose. The oligosaccharides were purified by two rounds of gel filtration using P2 columns (Bio-Rad) as described by Proctor et al. [17]. The structure of the molecules were verified by highperformance anion-exchange chromatography analysis of the products generated by digestion with the GH51 arabinofuranosidase, a GH39 -xylosidase, which removes undecorated xylose residues from the non-reducing ends of xylo-oligosaccharides, or acid hydrolysis. To assay for PNP-Araf ase activity, the standard reaction conditions comprised 50 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate brought to pH 7.0 with NaOH, containing 1 mg/ml BSA and substrate concentrations that ranged from 0.5 to 2 times the K m value. The reaction was incubated with the enzyme (ranging from 4 nM to 8 µM) at 37 C and the increase in A400 was measured against time. The amount of product generated was calculated using a molar absorption coefficient (), at 400 nm wavelength for 4-nitrophenol at pH 7.0, of 10 500 M-1 · cm-1 . To measure the activity of the arabinofuranosidase against polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, the reaction was supplemented with 1 mM NAD+ and 50 µM galactose dehydrogenase (Megazyme International) and the release of arabinose was monitored at A340 to detect NADH production. To determine the temperature optimum of the arabinofuranosidase, the enzyme was assayed at various temperatures using 1 mM PNP-Araf as the substrate. Thermostability was assessed by incubating the enzyme at various temperatures for up to 60 min. Aliquots were removed at regular time intervals and assayed for PNP-Araf ase activity at 37 C using substrate at 1 mM.
Crystallization and data statistics

Pure protein as judged by SDS/PAGE was concentrated to 28 mg/ml and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Hepes using a Vivaspin 10 kDa cut-off concentrator. CtAraf 51A crystallization conditions were screened using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method together with the Hampton Crystal screen, Crystal screen 2 and Hampton PEG/Ion screen (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, U.S.A.). Drops containing 1 µl of protein were mixed together with 1 or 2 µl of the mother liquor. Initial crystals were found to grow in Hampton screen 1, condition number 7. This condition was optimized further to improve crystal quality, resulting in optimized conditions of 5 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) and 5 % (v/v) dioxane. A cryoprotectant solution was produced through the addition of 20 % (v/v) ethylene glycol to the composition of the mother liquor. The crystals were harvested in rayon fibre loops, bathed in cryoprotectant solution prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Ligand complexes were obtained by soaking wild-type or mutant crystals in 1 µl drops of mother liquor, and grains of ligand

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Activity of Ct Araf 51

Structure solution and refinement

All X-ray data were processed and integrated using MOSFLM [18] and scaled using SCALA with other computing using the CCP4 suite [19], unless stated otherwise. CtAraf 51A crystals were found to belong to space group P41 21 2 or P43 21 2 with the approximate cell dimensions of a = b = 173.5 Å, c = 272.2 Å. Native data to approx. 3.1 Å, but of poor quality, were used to produce an initial partial model that was used in subsequent refinement of the complex crystal structures. The native CtAraf 51A structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program PHASER with a monomer from the structure of the G. stearothermophilus Araf 51 (PDB code 1QW9) as a search model. The space group was confirmed to be P43 21 2 and six molecules were found in the asymmetric unit. Five per cent of the observations were set aside for cross-validation and used to monitor the progress of the refinement and for appropriate weighting of geometrical and temperature factor restraints. The program COOT [20] was used to make manual corrections to the model between cycles of refinement using the program REFMAC [21]. The complex structures were validated using PROCHECK [22]. Figures 2 and 3 were drawn with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific,

The gene encoding CtAraf 51 was expressed in E. coli cells at a high level and the full-length protein could be purified, a procedure eased by a simple heat denaturation step by virtue of the heat stability of the clostridial enzyme. Kinetics was performed on a variety of natural and non-natural substrates (Table 1). CtAraf 51 is, unsurprisingly, a thermophilic enzyme with T opt  82 C with PNP-Araf as substrate. Not surprisingly, the enzyme is most active on the artificial substrate PNP-Araf (kcat /K m  400 s-1 · mM-1 measured at 37 C), which contains a relatively good leaving group (pK a of 4-nitrophenyl is 7.2). CtAraf 51 was also highly active on small soluble oligosaccharides, notably -1,5-linked arabinobiose/arabinotriose and the AX2 which reflect the natural limit dextrin products of the action of arabinanases on arabinan and xylanases on wheat arabinoxylan. Indeed, CtAraf 51 is also highly efficient in the removal of the -1,3-linked arabinoside decorations of polymeric wheat arabinoxylan itself, although it is unlikely that this intracellular enzyme would encounter intact xylan in vivo. CtAraf 51 displays no significant activity against linear non-substituted arabinan, which likely reflects the low concentration of available arabinofuranoside moieties (the nonreducing terminal sugar is < 0.2 % of the substrate) or xyloglucan. Surprisingly, CtAraf 51 exhibits very low activity against sugar beet arabinan, and is thus unable to access the O-3 and O-2 linked arabinofuranose side chains in this polysaccharide. The activity of this clostridial enzyme is thus notably different from some

CtAraf 51 displays no signal peptide and is thus likely to be intracellular, whereas the Ce. japonicus enzyme is believed to be membrane-bound [4]. The specificity and location of CtAraf 51 are discussed, in light of the three-dimensional structure, below.

CtAraf 51 was crystallized and could be solved by molecular replacement using the related G. stearothermophilus enzyme [14], with which CtAraf 51 shares approx. 65 % sequence identity, as the search model. The 503 residues of CtAraf 51 can be traced from residue Lys2 through Gly502 with no breaks, with the exception of the A3 complex where residues 483­485 of chain E are disordered. Model building and refinement were non-trivial at the resolution of 2.7­2.9 Å and were aided greatly by the averaging of the six copies of CtAraf 51 in the asymmetric unit and the application of TLS (translation, libration and screw-rotation) refinement as implemented in REFMAC [25].

and deviations from stereochemical target values are as one would expect at this resolution (Table 2). As with the G. stearothermophilus Araf 51, the clostridial monomer displays an unusual architecture. The catalytic domain is an elaborated (/)8 barrel, approximately comprising residues 24­389, which is followed by a 12-stranded -sandwich domain one of whose strands is formed by the N-terminal 14 residues of the enzyme (Figure 2). As with the G. stearothermophilus Araf 51, the enzyme is arranged as a functional hexamer both in crystal and in solution (light scattering; results not shown) with 32 point group symmetry (a trimer of dimers).
Complex structures and the catalytic mechanism of Ct Araf 51

Family GH51 enzymes perform catalysis with net retention of anomeric configuration through the formation, and subsequent breakdown of a covalent -L-linked arabinofuranosyl-enzyme intermediate [26]. Two essential catalytic residues are required for such a reaction, an acid/base and an enzymatic nucleophile. The structure of the (/)8 barrel domain places GH51 into the superfamily defined as clan GH-A [15] in which both catalytic functions are glutamates that are found on strands -4 (acid/base) and -7 (nucleophile) respectively. In the case of CtAraf 51, these residues are Glu173 and Glu292 respectively. In order to allow complex formation, an inactive acid/base variant, Glu173 Ala, was constructed and shown to be inactive on natural substrates possessing poor leaving groups, such as A3 and AX2. Three-dimensional complexes were obtained with both A3 and AX2 (Table 2). Both complexes are of the `Michaelis' type, with unhydrolysed ligand spanning the active centre (Figure 3) and thus with an arabinofuranoside moiety in subsite - 1 (nomenclature according to [27]). The active centre is a funnelshaped canyon, with specificity for arabinofuranosides in the - 1 subsite (discussed below), but with sufficient breadth `above' to allow accommodation of different shapes and sizes of aglycone. An appropriate aromatic residue in the + 1 subsite, Trp178 , forms hydrophobic `stacking' with the aglycone moiety, xylose or arabinose in the AX2 and A3 complexes respectively, and both the side chain of this residue and the main chain of the 176­179

loop show conformational flexibility when accommodating AX2 versus A3. This open funnel is furnished with a number of other aromatic/hydrophobic residues with only a single direct hydrogen bond to the O-2 hydroxyl of xylose in the AX2 complex and none at all to the aglycone regions of A3 in the + 1 subsite or beyond. All other ligand hydroxy groups hydrogen-bond only with solvent water molecules, which presumably accounts for the relative promiscuity of CtAraf 51 compared with some of the more specific GH51 members. The topography of the active centre, in which the ligand points down into the funnel, also clearly permits the binding of decorated xylans (and arabinans) in which the arabinofuranoside moiety is perpendicular to the main hemicellulose chain. Indeed, in the AX2 complex, density beyond the first xylose group is both disordered and extending in both `directions'. This suggests that there is little specificity for the exact orientation of the + 1 xyloside, and thus the enzyme could accommodate arabinofuranosides in extended xylo-oligosaccharides (Figure 4) as one might expect for an enzyme with high catalytic efficiency on arabinoxylan (Table 1). In the `catalytic' - 1 subsite, the arabinoside in the AX2derived complex lies in an E3 (envelope) conformation and that from A3 in 4 T O (twist-boat) conformation with the consequence that the leaving group C-1­O glycosidic bond is axial with the nucleophile and with Glu292 poised for in-line nucleophilic attack, as observed on other related Michaelis complexes [14,28­30]. The OE2 to C-1 distance is 3.6 Å. The O-2 of the arabinofuranoside moiety interacts both with the nucleophile OE1 atom (2.6 Å) and with Asn172 of the `NE' (where `E' is the catalytic acid/base) signature motif of many clan GH-A enzymes although in the case of CtAraf 51, the third member of this motif is not a proline, as more normally observed, but methionine. The O-3 interacts both with the side chain of Glu27 and the main chain amide of Asn72 with the adjacent side chain of Phe73 providing the steric blockage that forms the base of the funnel and which contributes to the exocatalytic activity. The O-5 of the exocyclic hydroxymethyl group is sandwiched between Gln352 (NE2 at 3.0 Å) and Tyr244 (OH at 3.0 Å). The interactions of the - 1 subsite observed here, are similar to those reported for the G. stearothermophilus enzyme [14]. The only difference is that the sugar ring conformation observed in the G. stearothermophilus enzyme was a 4 T O twist conformation, whereas we have modelled the conformation on the Cl. thermocellum enzyme as an E3 envelope. This difference

may simply reflect the lower resolution of the data available for CtAraf 51.
Summary

The substrate specificity of GH51 enzymes reflects the different mechanisms by which micro-organisms utilize plant structural polysaccharides. For example, the GH51 arabinofuranosidases of Ce. japonicus and Streptomyces chartreusis are approx. 300-fold more active against -1,2- and -1,3-linked arabinofuranose residues than -1,5 arabino-oligosaccharides. This is consistent with the observation that the Gram-negative bacterium utilizes arabinotriose but not arabinofuranose as a growth substrate, and thus the hydrolysis of the trisaccharide by the major extracellular arabinofuranosidase, CjAraf 51A, would have a detrimental effect on the survival of the prokaryote. In contrast, CtAraf 51 displays considerable plasticity with respect to the -glycosidic bond and the nature of the aglycone component of the substrate. This is entirely consistent with the role of the intracellular clostridial enzyme which is likely to be the release of arabinose moieties from xylan-derived decorated oligosaccharides and linear -1,5-linked arabino-oligosaccharides. While the substrate specificity of the G. stearothermophilus enzyme against substrates other than aryl-glycosides is unknown, its cytoplasmic location and high sequence identity with CtAraf 51 suggest that the Geobacillus hydrolase displays a similar role and specificity to the clostridial glycoside hydrolase. This proposal is entirely consistent with the observation that Trp178 , which is the key specificity determinant for the aglycone sugar in CtAraf 51, is conserved in the Geobacillus arabinofuranosidase as is the flexible loop extending from 176 to 179. The complete degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides requires the orchestrated action of a complex enzymatic consortium. In the case of xylan degradation, `side chain' decorations such as glucuronosyl, acetyl, arabino and feruloyl moieties must be removed either prior or subsequent to the action of endoxylanases, and prior to the action of -xylosidases. In many cases, the accessory enzymes will be secreted, or remain intimately associated with the membrane. In the case of the cellulosomepossessing Cl. thermocellum, the vast majority of enzymes involved in plant cell wall degradation will be attached, through their dockerin domains (described at the structural level in [31]), to the complex multienzyme machine termed the cellulosome. There is increasing awareness that some enzymes, somewhat counter-intuitively, reside inside the cell. Examples include the G. stearothermophilus -glucuronidase [32], although this enzyme species only targets xylo-oligosaccharides in which the nonreducing xylose is decorated with an -1,2-linked 4-O-methylglucuronic acid moiety irrespective of its cellular location [33], and some acetyl-xylo-oligosaccharide deacetylases (discussed in [34]). The absence of any signal peptide on the CtAraf 51 also demands that this enzyme is intracellular, suggesting an emerging picture that xylan breakdown products are not simply imported into organisms as mono/disaccharides, but as partially substituted sugars retaining their arabinoside, acetyl and glucuronyl substituents. Such a role may account for the relaxed specificity of the CtAraf 51 reported in the present study.
