right-hand cohesive end of coliphage Sixteen of the 19 nucleotides of the 5'.terminated 186 DNA were unequivocally determined by means of ribo-substitution-repair synthesis, using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase with three deoxyribonucteoside triphosphates and one ribonucleoside triphosphate, followed by specific enzymatic digestion of the labeled DNA and sequence analysis of the purified oligonucleotides. This work shows the usefulness of partial ribonuclease A digestion of the ribo-substituted DNA in sequence analysis.

Significant advances have been made recently in the field of DNA sequence analysis with the use of repair synthesis to produce short segments of highly radioactive DNA (1, 2). The usefulness of repair synthesis was greatly extended when coupled to the technique of ribo-substitution. Berg et al. (3) showed that DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli can be forced to incorporate a ribonucleotide instead of the corresponding deoxynucleotide during repair synthesis. This ribo-substitution technique provides specific cleavages of the labeled products, which has proved extremely useful in DNA sequence analysis. The 3'.5'phosphodiester linkage between two ribonucleotides or between ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide is susceptible to attack by alkali or several of the basespecific RNases. Thus, extension of a primer which has been annealed to the template DNA can produce ribo-sub' This is paper XXIII in the series, "Nucleotide Sequence Analysis of DNA."

stituted DNA, which can be specifically cleaved to produce small discrete fragments for more rapid sequence analysis. Fractionation of these specific fragments by homochromatography and sequencing these fragments with the use of a twodimensional fingerprinting system of their partial enzymatic digest have been widely used (4-7). In the systems so far studied, it appeared that DNA polymerase I copied the template DNA as accurately with one rNTP' and three dNTP's as it did with all four dNTP's (8-11). In order to eliminate the need for using two different overlapping sequences in a ribo-substituted region, one needs to establish conditions for partial RNase digestion. It is the purpose of this paper to show that at low enzyme concentrations, only certain rN-dN bonds are susceptible to specific cleavage by RNase. For this purpose, we have chosen the right-hand cohesive end of coliphage 186 DNA for two reasons. (a) It has a 19-nucleotide-long single-stranded end which can serve as a template for repair synthesis. The repaired segment is expected to be complementary to the known

Thus, after determining the sequence, the new sequence could be compared with that of the left-hand end for complementarity which would also reflect the accuracy of the ribo-substitution method. (b) The sequence to be repair synthesized contains several rCdN bonds, which could be used to test the feasibility of using partial RNase A digestion to obtain longer fragments.

To accomplish these objectives, 186 DNA was repaired at the cohesive ends by DNA polymerase I using [a-32P]dGTP, dATP, TTP, and rCTP. Fragments produced from a partial RNase A digest were isolated by homochromatography, and their nucleotide sequences determined. By this technique, we were able to rapidly determine 16 of the 19 nucleotides in the right-hand cohesive end. The sequence determined was completely complementary to that at the left-hand cohesive end which proved the adequacy of the method.

The labeled DNA (rpC. dpA, dpT. and d$) was digested with ribonuclease A. using conditions that were modified from those of Hamilton and Wu (11. 14) to produce a partial digest. The incubation mixture contained (in a volume of 4.,5 ml): 150 pg labeled DNA, 100 pg salmon sperm DNA. 10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, at 37"C, 1 rnh%EDTA, and 45 pg of rihonuclease A.

Isolation and characterization of ribo C-substituted oligonucleotides incorporated into the right-hand cohesive end. In order to isolate specific fragments from the

right-hand cohesive end of 186 DNA, the cohesive ends were repaired in the presence of rCTP, three dNTP's, DNA polymerase 1. and Mnf2. It has been shown (11) that under these conditions DNA polymerase will only incorporate on the average 1.5 rpC's in a row. Examination of the sequence at the left-hand cohesive end (113) shows that it contains several stretches of C's. (Fig. 1 upper panel); thus. it will be only paytially repaired. Therefore, by using a dGTP label, only fragments from the repair of the right-hand cohesive end can be isolated as 3'P-labeled oligonucleotides after ribonuclease A digestion. The ribo-Csubstituted labeled DNA was partially digested with ribonuclease A and the products were separated by one-dimensional homochromatography. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Analysis by complete spleen phosphodiesterase digestion of spot 10 showed this oligonucleotide to contain 5 dpG, 4 dpA, and 1 dpT residues, with a 3'.nucleoside dT, and to contain 3 dG:G and 1 dA;G sequences. The complete sequence of oligonucleotide 10 was determined by combining the information from a partial spleen phosphodiesterase and a partial venom phosphodiesterase digestion of the oligomer. From the characteristic mobility shifts (6) of the six spots shown in Fig. 3A the sequence dG-G-G-G-Ap can be deduced from the Ei'-end of oligomer 10. Similarly, from the mobility shifts of the 10 spots shown in Fig. 3B the sequence

dG-G-A-A-A-G-rC-A-T can be deducc,l from the 3'-end of oligomer 10. The two sequences provide sufficient overlap to allow the assignment of the sequence dG-G-G-G-A-A-A-G-rC-A-T-OH to oligomer 10. Thus, the oligomer is an undecamer which still contains an inner ribo-C and the sequence assigned also fits the nearest-neighbor and 3'-end analysis. Complete spleen phosphodiesterase digestion of spot 11 in Fig. 2 showed it to contain 3 dpG and 1 dpT residues with 1.2 dT:G and 1.0 dGhG sequences. This analysis yielded no 3'-end nucleoside. This can only be explained by placing a C at the 3'-end because the rC contained no label at all. The complete sequence of oligomer 11 was established by partial digestion with

spleen phosphodiesterase (Fig. 4A) and venom phosphodiesterase (Fig. 4B). From the mobility shifts of the four spots of Fig. 4A the sequence dG-T-Gp can be deduced for oligomer 11 from the 5'.end. From the mobility shifts of the three spots of Fig. 4B the sequence dpG-rC can be deduced for oligomer 11 from the 3'-end. With these two sequences and the nearest-neighbor data we can assign the sequence dG-T-G-G-rCp for oligomer 11 showing that it is a pentamer and does contain rC at the 3'-end. Three pieces of information allow the order of oligomers 10 and 11 to be determined: (a) they both come from the right-hand cohesive end which is 19 nucleotides long (13); (b) the 5'.terminal ends of 186 DNA are dA and dG (14, see Fig. 1);

"All the oligonucleotides that were analyzed were products of partial micrococcal nuclease digestion of labeled 186 DNA. The products were first separated by two-dimensional ionophoresis (21) as shown in Fig, 5A and 5B. All the oligonucleotides given in this table are deoxyribonucleotides. For simplicity the prefix d is omitted. Oligonucleotides 1 and 2 came from Fig. 5A (DNA. labe!ed wjth d;+, dpA, dpe, dpk), and oligonucleotide 6 came from Fig. 5B (DNA labeled with d$, dpT. dpC. dpG). Oligonucleotide `i came from a related experiment when the DNA was labeled with d$?, dpk, dpTi`, dpl\.

thus, the repaired segment is expected to end with a T or dC at the 3'-end; and (c) a ribonuclease A digest was used to produce these oligomers. Thus, we can place oligomer 11 at the 5'-side of oligomer 10 and arrive at the sequence dG-T-G-G-rC-G-GG-G-A-A-A-G-rC-A-T-OH in the righthand cohesive end. The sequence given above is also supported by sequence information obtained from oligonucleotides produced by repairing the cohesive ends of 186 DNA, with one

[32P]dNTP and three [3H]dNTP, followed by micrococcal nuclease digestion and separation of the products on 2-dimensional electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 5. using the procedures reported earlier (2). The sequence information obtained from these oligonucleotides is given in Table I. Determination of the comwlete nucleotide sequence of the right-hand cohesive end.

G-K-A-T-OH in the right-hand cohesive end from its 3'-end. Further support is added to this from the sequences of oligonucleotides 1 and 7, dA-G-C-A-T-OH as well as oligonucleotides 2 and 6, dA-AG-C-A-T-OH (see Table I), which can all be placed at the 3'-end of the right-hand cohesive end. This information unequivocally places oligonucleotide 10, dG-G-GG-A-A-A-G-rC-A-T-OH at the 3'-end. It follows then that, since oligonucleotide 11 was produced from a ribonuclease A digest, it can only be on the 5'-end of oligonucleotide 10 which was produced from the same digest. This gives rise to the hexadecamer sequence shown above at the 3'-end of the right-hand cohesive end. Wu (1) has shown by partial incorporation that the first four nucleotides inserted into the right-hand end of 186 DNA are dG-G-C-G. This information and the fact that the cohesive ends of 186 DNA are 19 nucleotides long (13) yields the complete sequence, dG-G-C-G-T-G-G-C-G-G-G-GA-A-A-G-C-A-T-OH, which was incorporated into the right-hand cohesive end of 186 DNA (Fig. 1, lower panel).

In this communication, we have rapidly determined 16 of the 19 nucleotides at the right-hand cohesive end of 186 DNA using the ribo-substitution technique. We found the accuracy of the technique, as applied to long molecules of essentially duplex DNA, to be 100% at high salt (250 mM NaCl equivalence, by conductivity measurement) and 5°C. We found it possible to generate a partial RNase A digest by using 7-8 pg of this enzyme per ml during the digestion with DNA concentration between 30 and 60 pg/ml. Potentially, by generating a partial digest with RNase A, one can obviate the need for first obtaining products from a complete digestion, sequencing them, and then trying to overlap them. Another time-saving feature of this approach as we present it here is that we have determined the sequence of the 16 nucleotides with only one 32P-labeled dNTP in a single experiment.
