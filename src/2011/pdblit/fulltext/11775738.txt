Abstract The solution structure and hydration of a DNA·RNA hybrid chimeric duplex [d(CGC)r(amam am )d(TTTGCG)]2 in which the RNA adenines were substituted by 2 -O-methylated riboadenines was determined using two-dimensional NMR, simulated annealing, and restrained molecular dynamics. Only DNA residue 7T in the 2 -OMe-RNA·DNA junction adopted an O4 -endo sugar conformation, while the other DNA residues including 3C in the DNA·2 OMe-RNA junction, adopted C1 -exo or C2 -endo conformations. The observed NOE intensity of 2 -O-methyl group to H1 proton of 4am at the DNA·2 -OMe-RNA junction is much weaker than those of 5am and 6am . The 2 -O-methyl group of 4am was found to orient towards the minor groove in the trans domain while the 2 -O- methyl groups of 5am and 6am were found to be in the gauche (+) domain. In contrast to the longlived water molecules found close to the RNA adenine H2 and H1 protons and the methyl group of 7T in the RNA-DNA junction of [d(CGC)r(aaa)d(TTTGCG)]2, there were no long-lived water molecules found in [d(CGC)r(amam am )d(TTTGCG)]2. This is probably due to the hydrophobic enviroment created by the 2 -Omethylated riboadenines in the minor groove or due to the wider minor groove width in the middle of the structure. In addition, the 2 -O-methylation of riboadenines in pure chimeric duplex increses its melting temperature from 48.5  C to 51.9  C. The characteristic structural features and hydration patterns of this chimeric duplex provide a molecular basis for further therapeutic applications of DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes with 2 -modified RNA residues. Introduction The structure and recognition of DNA·RNA hybrid duplexes and DNA·RNA chimeric duplexes have been the focus of numerous studies because of their crucial roles in transcription, reverse transcription, and replication (Ban et al., 1994; Chou et al., 1989; Gonzalez et al., 1994; Gyi et al., 1998; Hall and McLaughlin, 1991; Hashem et al., 1998; Jaishree et al., 1993; Nishizaki et al., 1996; Ratmeyer et al., 1994; Rice and Gao, 1997; Wang et al., 1982).

is well known that incorporation of 2 -O-methylated RNA residues can increase the thermal stability and inhibit RNase H hydrolysis of DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes (Nishizaki et al., 1997; Tereshko et al., 1998). Significant efforts have been made thereafter on the structural studies of 2 -O-modified RNA analogues into the DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes owing to their potential therapeutic applications such as antisense agents and enzyme inhibitors (Egli and Gryaznov, 2000). X-ray crystallographic studies have found that even the introduction of one 2 -O-methylated ribonucleotide into the DNA strand transforms the whole duplex to the A-form geometry with all the sugars

210 in the C3 -endo conformation and the 2 -O-methyl groups directed into the minor groove (Lubini et al., 1994; Tereshko et al., 1998). The increased stability of the DNA·RNA chimeric duplex was attributed to the hydrophobic interactions between substituents in the minor groove (Lubini et al., 1994). Similar results have been found for NMR structural studies of (ggagaugac)·(gmum cm ATCTcm cm ) (Nishizaki et al., 1997), where lowercase letters, capital letters, and lowercase letters with the subscript m are RNA, DNA, and 2 -O-methylated RNA. The overall structure of (ggagaugac)·(gmum cm ATCTcm cm ) was close to the typical A-form duplex with sugars having C3 -endo conformations and the 2 -O-methyl groups pointing into the minor groove with the torsion angles in the gauche(+) domain (Nishizaki et al., 1997). On the other hand, NMR studies have revealed that for (GCGTTGCG)·(gm gm cm am am cm cm cm ), the sugars of the 2 -O-methylated RNA residues are in the C3 -endo conformation but the sugars of the complementary DNA strand are mainly in the C2 -endo conformation (Blommers et al., 1994). Similar heteromerous structure in which the sugars of the RNA strand have the normal N-type C3 -endo conformation, but the sugars of the DNA strand have the intermediate O4 -endo conformation, have been observed for pure DNA·RNA hybrid duplexes by NMR (Gonzalez et al., 1994, 1995; Gyi et al., 1998; Salazar et al., 1993b). The minor groove width of pure DNA·RNA hybrid duplexes was found to be between that of Aand B-form duplexes (Fedoroff et al., 1993). These structural features were used to explain the mechanism whereby RNase H discriminates between DNA·RNA hybrid duplexes and pure RNA or DNA duplexes (Fedoroff et al., 1993). Previously, we have determined the solution structure and hydration of the chimeric duplex [d(CGC)r(aaa)d(TTTGCG)]2 (Hsu et al., 2000a, b). The solution structure of this chimeric duplex differs from the previously determined X-ray structure of the analogous B-DNA duplex [d(CGCAAATTTGCG)]2 (Edwards et al., 1992) as well as NMR structure of the analogous A-RNA duplex [r(cgcaaauuugcg)]2 (Conte et al., 1997). The long-lived water molecules with correlation time c larger than 0.3 ns were found close to the RNA adenine H2 and H1 protons in the hybrid segment. A long-lived water molecule was also detected close to the methyl group of 7T in the RNA-DNA junction but not with the other two thymines (8T and 9T). Only DNA residue 7T in the RNA-DNA junction adopted an O4 -endo sugar conformation, while the other DNA residues including 3C in the DNA-RNA junction, adopted C1 -exo or C2 -endo conformations. The minor groove width of [d(CGC)r(aaa)d(TTTGCG)]2 is wider than its B-DNA analog but narrower than that of the A-RNA analog. These distinct structural features and hydration patterns of the chimeric duplex provide a molecular basis for further understanding the structure and recognition of DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes. Recently, Kochetkov and co-workers have found that RNA/DNA chimeras can be used as templates for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (Gudima et al., 1997). Hogrefe et al. have reported that DNA·RNA hybrid flanked by DNA duplexes can be recognized by E. coli RNase H (Hogrefe et al., 1990). Also, it has been proposed that RT-associated RNaseH domain, which degrades the RNA template of DNA·RNA hybrid chimeric duplexes, may distinguish double-strand RNA, RNA·DNA junctions and hybrid duplexes according to their distinct hydration patterns (Szyperski et al., 1999). In the present manuscript we describe the solution structure of a DNA·RNA chimeric duplex [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG)]2 in which the RNA residues are substituted by 2 -O-methylated riboadenines. The possible correlation between the structure and functional properties of this chimeric duplex may have potential therapeutic applications with the important enzymes such as HIV reverse transcriptase and RNase H.

Materials and methods Sample preparations The d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG) dodecamer was prepared on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer in 6 µmol scale using solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry (Chou et al., 1989). The purified sample (15 mg) was dissolved in 0.3 ml of 90%H2 O:10%D2 O containing 20 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM sodium chloride and 0.05 mM EDTA, at pH 7.0. For non-exchangeable proton studies, the sample was repeatedly dried from 99.96% D2 O in a speed vacuum, and then dissolved in 0.3 ml of 99.996% D2 O. NMR spectroscopy NMR data were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a tripleresonance three-axis gradient probe. The phase sensi-

211 tive NOESY and ROESY spectra in water (containing 10%D2O) were recorded at 273, 278, 283 and 300 K under identical conditions except at different mixing times of 50 and 100 ms, respectively. The intense bulky water signal was suppressed using the Watergate method (Piotto et al., 1992) with a short delay  of 139 µs, resulting the optimum excitation near 1.7, 7.7, and 13.7 ppm. These spectra were collected into 2048 complex points in the t2 dimension and 800 complex points in the t1 dimensions with relaxation delay of 1.4 second between each scan. These data were further apodized with a sin-square window function and zero-filled to 4096 complex points in the t2 dimension and 1024 complex points in the t1 dimension. For nonexchangable protons, NOESY spectra at four different mixing times of 60, 120, 240 and 480 ms were acquired during a 4-day period without removing the sample from the probe at 303 K. These phase-sensitive NOESY spectra were collected into 2048 complex points in the t2 dimension and 512 points in the tl dimension with 32 scans per tl experiment and a relaxation delay of 5 seconds between each scan (Wang et al., 1992). The acquired data were transferred to an IRIS Indigo 2 workstation and processed using the XWIN-NMR program (Bruker). The NOESY data sets were apodized with a shiftedsinebell window function for the first 512 points and zero filled to 2048 points in both the t2 and tl dimensions. The DQF-COSY spectrum was recorded in the phase-sensitive mode with time-proportional phase incrementation. Distance restraint determinations The proton-proton distances were calculated using the NOE initial rate two-spin approximation at short mixing times normalized to the cross-relaxation rate of the cytosine H5-H6 proton pairs in NOESY spectra collected in D2 O (dH 5-H 6 = 2.5 Å) (Noggle and Schirmer, 1971). To guard against spin-diffusion, we initially used the qualitative NOE pattern to establish that this duplex is in the broad family of right-handed structures, and then used this information to ascertain which spin pairs are likely to have an intervening third spin that might produce errors in the calculated distance (Cheng et al., 1992). For non-exchangeable protons, typical error limits for the upper and lower bound restraints were ±0.4 Å for distances less than 3 Å, ±0.8 Å for distances less than 4 Å, and ±1.4 Å for distances greater than 4 Å. For exchangeable protons, the distance restraints were set loosely to 2­4 Å for strong cross-peaks and 3­6 Å for weak cross-peaks in NOESY spectra collected in water. Based on the averaged hydrogen bond length derived from structure coordinates of twenty DNA, RNA, and DNA·RNA hybrid duplexes (PDB code: 124d, 161d, 1al5, 1d65, 1d87, 1d88, 1d96, 1dpl, 1dpn, 1efs, 1evp, 1gtc, 1nao, 1pbm, 1pbl, 259d, 310d, 398d, 410d, 461d), the hydrogen bond restraints were defined as following: A(N6)-T(O4) = 2.94 ± 0.20 Å, A(N1)-T(N3) = 2.82 ± 0.20 Å , G(N1)-C(N3) = 2.95 ± 0.20 Å, G(N2)C(O2) = 2.86 ± 0.20 Å, G(O6)-C(N4) = 2.95 ± 0.20 Å. Sugar and backbone conformations To maintain a right-handed helix structure between Aand B-form conformation, six backbone dihedral angles restraints ( = -65 ± 60,  = 170 ± 60,  = 55 ± 60,  = 115 ± 60 for DNA and 90 ± 60 for RNA residues,  = 180 ± 60 and  = -75 ± 60 ) were employed for each residue to exclude unreasonable geometry. The sugar and backbone conformation of the individual residue was further confirmed via a combination of NOESY distances and J -coupling data, as outlined by Reid and co-workers (Kim et al., 1991; Salazar et al., 1993a). This combined strategy to constrain the backbone was used for other DNA·RNA chimeras (Fedoroff et al., 1996; Hsu et al., 2000a; Nishizaki et al., 1996; Salazar et al., 1996, 1994; Zhu et al., 1995) and described in more detail elsewhere (Cheng et al., 1992; Kim et al., 1991). In addition, two sugar pucker dihedral angle restraints (from a combination of NOESY and DQF-COSY data) and one  angle restraint were also added to maintain the B-type and A-type sugar conformation for DNA and RNA residues, respectively. Structure calculations and analysis Three-dimensional structures of [d(CGC)r(amam am ) d(TTTGCG)]2 were calculated using 454 NOE distance restraints, 30 hydrogen bond restraints, and 208 backbone, sugar, and glycosidic dihedral angle restraints. Distance restraints were derived from 258 intranucleotide, 142 sequential, 4 cross-strand, and 50 exchangeable proton NOEs. Initial A- and B-form DNA· 2 -O-methylated-RNA chimeric structures were generated using Insight II (Molecular Simulations Inc.) program. First, the simulated annealing protocol in the program X-PLOR 3.851 (A.T. Brünger, Yale University) was applied to the starting structures at 1000 K and slowly cooled to 300 K with a time step

of 1.5 ps per 50 K. From the 50 simulated annealing structures, ten structures with the lowest energy were chosen for further optimization. Restrained molecular dynamic was then carried out in vacuum with a distance-dependent dielectric constant. The dynamics was initiated at 300 K and the temperature was gradually increased to 1000 K with a time step of 0.5 ps per 50 K and then evolved for 20 ps at 1000 K. Subsequently, the system was cooled down to 300 K in 14 ps and equilibrated for 9 ps. The coordinates saved after every 0.5 ps in the last 2.0 ps of the equilibrium were averaged, and the averaged structure was subjected to a further conjugate gradient minimization of 500 steps using Powell algorithm until a final gradient of 0.1 kcal mol-1 was reached. All the structures were finally refined by relaxation matrix based on NOE intensity (Yip & Case, 1989). NOE volumes of 125 cross-peaks were integrated for each NOESY spectrum at three different mixing times (60, 120 and 240 ms) and used as restraints with uniform upper and lower bonds of ±10%. These restraints were doubled to 250 for two degenerate strands. With the incor-

poration of distance and dihedral restraints, the R1/6 factor (Nilges et al., 1991; White et al., 1992) was minimized during the refinement. A cutoff of 5.5 Å was applied for relaxation calculation and an isotropic correlation time of 5.0 ns was used based on a grid search. During dynamics, the temperature of the system was slowly heated from 100 K to 1000 K as the force constant of relaxation was scale up to a final value of 400. Simultaneously, the force constants of distance restraints of non-exchangeable protons were scaled down to zero. The system was then cooled down to 300 K and the final structure was subjected to conjugate gradient minimization until a final gradient of 0.1 kcal mol-1 was reached. The hydrogen bonding of base pairing and exchangeable proton distance restraints were maintained throughout the refinement. Ten final refined structures were selected for further structural analysis. The helical parameters and torsion angles were analyzed by CURVE 5.2 (Lavery and Sklenar, 1989). The family of 10 structures, together with the NMR restraints used in their determination, has been deposited with the Protein Data

Results Resonance assignments and analysis of NMR data The numbering system for [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTG CG)]2 as well as its expanded region of the 2D NOESY spectrum in H2 O recorded at 278 K, 14.1 T is shown in Figure 1. Its exchangeable and nonexchangeable proton cross-peaks were assigned using NOESY, ROESY, and TOCSY spectra. The H1 protons were assigned by standard sequential assignment method, followed by the assignment of H2 and H2 protons of DNA, as well as H3 and H4 protons of all residues (Hare et al., 1983; Wuthrich, 1986). The H2 proton of the three 2 -O-methylated RNA adenines were assigned using the H2 -H3 cross-peaks in the TOCSY spectrum. All the three 2 -O-methylated RNA adenine H2 protons showed both interresidue and intraresidue cross-peaks, particularly in the H6/H8-H1 region (Figure 1). No cross-peaks between 2 -O-methylated RNA adenine H2 protons and water along the F2 dimension were detected (Figure 1). In addition to the exchangeable and non-exchangeable proton assignments, we have observed three sets of NOEs from the three 2 O-methyl groups resonating at 3.5­4.0 ppm to the ribose protons. These chemical shifts are in agreement with previously published assignments of 2 O-methyl protons (Blommers et al., 1994; Nishizaki et al., 1997). Comparing with the pure DNA·RNA chimeric duplex [d(CGC)r(aaa)d(TTTGCG)]2 (Hsu et al., 2000a), major chemical shift perturbations

were found in the central hybrid segment. Significant up-field shifts were found for H2 protons of 2 -Omethylated RNA adenines and for the methyl groups of thymines (data not shown). The chemical shifts of the exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons of [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TITGCG)]2 are provided in the supplementary materials (Table S1). In the NOESY data collected in D2 O for the H8/H6 to the DNA H2 /H2 region (data not shown), the (n)H6/H8 to (n)H2 peaks were the most intense and were stronger than the (n)H6/H8 to (n-1)H2 peaks, which in turn were uniformly stronger than the (n)H6/H8 to (n)H2 and (n)H6/H8 to (n-l)H2 peaks. These results indicate that none of the DNA residue in this chimeric duplex assumes a pure A-form conformation in solution. Furthermore, all the DNA sugar residues have quite respectable H1 -H2 and H3 -H4 cross peaks in the DQF-COSY spectrum indicating that sugar conformations for the DNA residues are not A-form (data not shown). The DNA residue 7T in the RNA-DNA junction, however, was found to have medium to strong H2 -H3 DQF-COSY cross peak (Figure 2). The other DNA residues, including residue 3C in the DNA-RNA junction, showed very weak or no detectable H2 -H3 cross peaks in the DQF-COSY spectrum. The above results indicate that residue 7T in the 2 -OMe-RNA·DNA junction adopts a sugar conformation close to the O4 -endo, while the other DNA residues adopt C1 -exo or C2 -endo conformations (Hsu et al., 2000a; Salazar et al., 1993a). No detectable H1 -H2 DQF-COSY cross peaks for 2 -O-methylated RNA adenines were observed. Also, strong (n)H8 to (n-1)H2 NOESY cross peaks were found for the 2 -O-methylated RNA adenines indicating that the 2 -O-methylated RNA segment in the chimeric strand assumes an A-form conformation.

Hydration of [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG)]2 The qualitative and quantitative water hydration residence time can be determined by the cross-relaxation rate constants using NOESY and ROESY spectra (Hsu et al., 2000b; Lane et al., 1997; Otting et al., 1991). Previously, long-lived water molecules (correlation time c > 0.3 ns), with opposite signs of NOE and ROE, were found close to all H2 and H1 protons of the RNA adenines of [d(CGC)r(aaa)d(TTTGCG)]2 (Hsu et al., 2000b).

Similar water-H1 cross-peaks in RNA were also observed previously (Conte et al., 1996). The methyl group of 7T in [d(CGC)r(aaa)d(TTTGCG)]2 also exhibited a positive NOE to water at 273 K, i.e., with a water correlation time longer than 0.3 ns. However, no such long-lived water molecules were found for the H2 and H1 protons of the 2 -O-methylated RNA adenines or for the methyl group of 7T in [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG)]2 (Figure 1). This result is probably due to the hydrophobic enviroment

created by the 2 -O-methyl groups of the three 2 -Omethylated RNA adenines in the minor groove. Orientation of 2 -O-methyl protons NMR and X-ray studies of DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes with 2 -O-methylated ribonucleotide insersions indicated that the 2 -O-methyl groups had the orientation with the gauche(+) torsion angles near 60 (Blommers et al., 1994; Lubini et al., 1994; Nishizaki et al., 1997). The gauche(+) orientations of 2 -O-methyl groups were attributed to that the C3 -endo sugar conformation pushing the bulky methyl group toward the minor groove and hence avoided contact with the opposite intraresidue 3 -phosphate group (Kawai et al., 1992; Nishizaki et al., 1997). According to an A-type helix model, the intranucleotide distances between the 2 -O-methyl group and the ribose protons with gauche(+) orientation can be calculated as follow: 2 -O-methyl group to H1 proton is around 3 Å; 2 -O-methyl group to H2 proton is less than 3Å; 2 -O-methyl group to H3 proton is larger than 3.5 Å; and 2 -O-methyl group to H4 proton is larger than 4 Å.

distances using the thymine H6-Me distance (2.9 Å) as a standard, 2 -O-methyl groups of 5am and 6am were found to orient toward the gauche(+) domain (Blommers et al., 1994; Lubini et al., 1994; Nishizaki et al., 1997). Surprisingly, this is not the case for 4am at the DNA·2 -OMe-RNA junction. The observed NOE intensity of 2 -O-methyl group to H1 proton for 4am is much weaker than those of 5am and 6am (Figure 3). The 2 -O-methyl group of 4am was found to orient towards the trans domain with torsion angle near 180. Such trans orientation was not observed in other DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes with 2 O-methylated RNAs (Blommers et al., 1994; Lubini et al., 1994; Nishizaki et al., 1997). T1 relaxation times of [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTT GCG)]2 T1 relaxation times of the resolved protons of [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG)]2 were determined using the method described by Wang et al. (1992). T1 values of the H2 protons of the 2 -O-methylated 4am and 5am were found to be 4.3 sec. T1 values of 6am H2, 4am H8, and 5am H8 protons were found

The other DNA residues, including residue 3C in the DNA-RNA junction, showed weak or no detectable H2 - H3 DQF-COSY cross-peaks.

to be 3.6 sec. T1 value of 6am H8 proton was found to be 2.9 sec. For the DNA aromatic and anometic protons, all T1 values were found to be around 2.2 sec. Thus, the non-selective T1 relaxation times for the aromatic protons of the 2 -O-methylated RNA adenines were 1.5­2 times longer than those of the DNAs in [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG)]2. As pointed out by Wang et al. (1992), for DNA·RNA chimeric duplexes, reliable distance data can be obtained from timedependent NOESY data sets provided an adequately long relaxation delay is used. To avoid substantial errors due to the short relaxation delay, NOESY spectra were recorded at four different mixing times of 60, 120, 240 and 480 ms with a relaxation delay of 5 s at 303 K.

A total of ten final simulated annealing, restrained molecular dynamics, and NOE relaxation matrix refined structures (five from initial A-form and five from

initial B-form structures) were superimposed as shown in Figure 4. The energetic and geometric statistics of the ten best-refined structures are given in Table 1. The final ten structures superimposed well with a pairwise rmsd (heavy atoms) of 0.31 ± 0.12 Å for the hybrid segment and 1.12 ± 0.37 Å for the overall structures (Table 1). The average R1/6 factor was 0.0268 ± 0.00026 which resembles well with the experimental data. Previously, the X-ray structure of the DNA duplex, [d(CGCAAATTTGCG)]2, was found to be of B-type (Edwards et al., 1992) and the structure of the RNA duplex, [r(cgcaaauuugcg)]2, was determined to be an A-type by NMR spectroscopy (Conte et al., 1997). The solution conformation of the pure DNA·RNA chimeric duplex, [d(CGC)r(aaa)d(TTTGCG)]2, was determined to be between it's A-RNA and B-DNA analogs (Hsu et al., 2000a). In comparison to its non-methylated analog, some of the local structural parameters of [d(CGC)r(amam am )d(TTTGCG)]2 were more similar to the A-type RNA duplex than to the pure DNA·RNA chimeric duplexe, particularly with respect to the minor groove width and the x-displacement (Figure 5A). The minor groove width in the central hybrid segment

of [d(CGC)r(amam am )d(TTTGCG)]2 is close to the canonical A-RNA and A-DNA duplex (Figure 5A). Figure 5B shows the sugar puckers for the final NMR refined solution structures compared to its DNA, RNA, and pure chimeric duplex analogs as well as standard B- and A-form DNA and Aform RNA. The sugar conformation of DNA residue 7T in the 2 -O-methylated-RNA-DNA junction was close to the O4 -endo range which was consistent with the spectral analysis. The sugar conformation of the rest of the DNA residues in this chimeric duplex are in the S-type range (C1 -exo to C2 -endo) while the 2 -O-methylated RNA residues are in the N-type range (C3 -endo). Other structural features (i.e. helical twists, X-displacement, rise, etc.) of [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG)]2 are shown in Table 3.

Discussion The solution structure of [d(CGC)r(amam am )d(TTTGC G)]2 is different from either the uniformly A-type RNA duplex [r(cgcaaauuugcg)]2in the solution state (Conte et al., 1997), or from the related B-type DNA duplex [d(CGCAAATTTGCG)]2 in crystalline state (Edwards et al., 1992). The sugar conformation of

218 duplex-hybrid duplex junction was found to be in the normal C1 -exo to C2 -endo conformation (Figure 5B). Thus, structural parameters of DNA residue at 5 -end of a DNA-hybrid junction are not affected by the A-type 2 -O-methylated RNA at 3 -end. Instead, changes in the structural parameters were observed for DNA residue at 3 -end of a hybrid junction by the Atype 2 -O-methylated RNA at 5 -end. This influence was involved in only one step. Based on NOE distances, the torsion angle of the 2 -O-methyl group of 4am was found to be in the trans domain whereas it is in the gauche (+) domain for 5am and 6am . The energy minimization study of the 2 -O-methyl group in mononucleotide showed that there are two stable orientations for the RNA 2 -Omethyl group, with torsion angles around 180 and 72 (Kawai et al., 1992). Our result provides the first evidence that, at the DNA·2 -OMe-RNA junction, the 2 -O-methyl group orients toward the trans domain. Nevertheless, the 2 -O-methyl groups of 4am , 5am , and 6am with trans or gauche (+) orientations, all point to the minor groove of the duplex. The width of the minor groove is an important structural parameter for DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes. Previous studies have shown that the minor groove width of the DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplex [d(CGC)r(aaa)d(TTTGCG)]2 was found to be closer to the B-DNA analog than to the A-RNA duplex and may be responsible for the recognition and cleavage activity by RNase H (Hsu et al., 2000a). In the present study we have observed that the minor groove width of [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG)]2 was closer to the canonical A-RNA and A-DNA (Figure 5A). This may be due to the steric effect of the bulky 2 -O-methyl groups in the minor groove. It was proposed that the incorporation of 2 -Omethyl ribonucleotide into DNA increases the melting temperature of the corresponding DNA·RNA duplexes by 0.8­1.4  C per modification (Tereshko et al., 1998). The increased stability of the DNA·RNA chimeric duplex was attributed to the hydrophobic interactions between substituents in the minor groove (Lubini et al., 1994). To test if the 2 -O-methyl modification does increase the stability of the DNA·RNA chimeric duplex in our case, we have studied the thermal stability of [d(CGC)r(am am am )d(TTTGCG)]2 (Figure 6). Indeed, the 2 -O-methylation of riboadenines in pure chimeric dulpex increses its melting temperature from 48.5  C to 51.9  C, which is consistent with the previous report (Tereshko et al., 1998).

The width is represented by the (n)P-(m+3)P phosphorus distance minus the phosphorus van der Waals radius of 5.8 Å. (B) Pseudo rotational phase angles (P) in the 10 final refined structures (-- --).

[d(CGC)r(amam am )d(TTTGCG)]2 exhibits properties of a chimeric mixture of A-form and B-form in solution, similar to its pure chimeric duplex as reported previously (Hsu et al., 2000a). With respect to the hybrid junctions, only the 7T·18am (or the symmetrical 19T·6am) DNA base pair in the hybrid junction is involved in the structural transition. Sugar conformation of 7T (19T) was found to be in the O4 -endo conformation based on both NOESY and DQF-COSY spectra (Figure 2). Sugar conformation of DNA residue 3C (15C) in the DNA

Since no long-lived water molecules with correlation time c larger than 0.3 ns were found close to the 2 O-methylated RNA adenine H2 and H1 protons in the hybrid segment and in the methyl group of 7T in the RNA-DNA junction, as observed in the case of the pure chimeric duplex (Hsu et al., 2000a, b), the increase in melting temperature may be due to the hydrophobic interactions between substituents in the minor groove (Lubini et al., 1994). Thus, if certain 2 -O-alkoxyalkyl substituents can be incorporated into the RNA residues to stabilize their hydration patterns, it may result in higher stability and nuclease resistance due to their hydrophobic interactions and the hydration patterns. This hypothesis was confirmed by the two recent X-ray structural studies of MOE (2 -Omethoxyethyl) and TOE (2 -O-methyl[tri-(oxyethyl)]) modified DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes (Teplova et al., 1999; Tereshko et al., 1998). Extensive bound water molecules and hydrogen bonds were found in the MOE, TOE groups and in the nucleotide backbones. Both of the 2 -MOE and 2 -TOE modified DNA·RNA chimeric duplexes were found to have higher stability than the 2 -O-methyl modified chimeric duplex (Tereshko et al., 1998). In conclusion, we have determined the solution structure of [d(CGC)r(amam am )d(TTTGCG)]2, where the central RNA adenines were substituted by 2 -Omethylated RNA adenines. The characteristic structural features of this chimeric duplex provide a ba-

sis for further understanding the possible therapeutic applications of DNA·RNA hybrid and chimeric duplexes with 2 -modified RNA residues.
