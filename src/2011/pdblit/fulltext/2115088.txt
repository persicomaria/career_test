The structure of calf chymosin (EC 3.4.23.3), the aspartic proteinase from the gastric mucosa, was solved using the technique of molecular replacement. We describe the use of different search models based on distantly related fungal aspartic proteinases and investigate the effect of using only structurally conserved regions. The structure has been refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 17 o/o at 2.2 A resolution with an estimated co-ordinate error of 0.21 A. In all, 136 water molecules have been located of which eight are internal. The structure of chymosin resembles that of pepsin and other aspartic proteinases. However, there is a considerable rearrangement of the active-site "flap" and, in particular, Tyr75 (pepsin numbering), which forms part of the specificity pockets S, and S',. This is probably a consequence of crystal packing. Electrostatic interactions on the edge of the substrate binding cleft appear to account for the restricted proteolysis of the natural substrate K-casein by chymosin. The local environment of invariant residues is examined, constraints and side-chain hydrogen bonding can play an important showing that structural role in the conservation of particular amino acids.

1. Introduction
Chymosin is a neonatal gastric aspartic proteinase that has been found in a number of mammals, including the cow, pig, dog, cat and rat (Foltmann & Axelsen, 1980). It is secreted by the mucosal cells of the fundus as an inactive zymogen (prochymosin) which is activated at acidic pH by the proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal 42 residue propeptide (Foltmann, 1981). Chymosin preferentially cleaves the Phe105-Met106 bond in the milk protein rc-casein, resulting in instability in milk micelles leading to clotting. This specificity, together with its relatively low proteolytic activity, may be necessary to avoid general protein degradation during postnatal uptake of immunoglobulins.

ability to clot milk, with limited proteolytic cleavage of rc-casein, makes it of great importance in the cheese manufacturing industry. The sequence of chymosin was fully determined by Foltmann et al. (1979). Calf chymosm is found in three major forms: A, B and C. Chymosins A and B differ at only one amino acid position: chymosin A has an Asp residue at position 243 (pepsin numbering), whereas this is a Gly residue in B. Chymosin C appears to be a degradation product of chymosin A (Danley & Geoghegan, 1988). Crystals of chymosin were first obtained by Bunn et aE. (1971), who determined the cell dimensions. The space group was either I222 or 12,2r2,, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Attempts to prepare heavy-atom derivatives in our laboratory for use in the method of isomorphous replacement proved unsuccessful (Jenkins et al., 1977). Thus, the method of molecular replacement was used to solve 1295

the cryst,al structure. Using X-ray data collected at Kirkbeck College. Safro et al. (1985) found the sob tion to the rotation function and showed that the space group was 1222. This was confirmed by Tickle (1985). However. some ambiguity existed in the x-component of the translation function. Several other aspartic proteinase structures have been solved by X-ray crystallography, including porcine pepsin (Andreeva et al.. 1984; Sielecki et al.. 1990; Cooper et al., 1990; Abad-Zapatero et al.. 1990), pepsinogen (James & Sielecki, 1986; Hartsuck &, Remington. 1988), human renin (Sielecki et al., 1989), endothiapepsin (Blundell et al., 1990), penicillopepsin (James & Sielecki, 1983), rhizopuspepsin (Suguna et al., 1987a) and the retroviral proteinases (Miller et al., 1989; Wlodawer et uE., 1989; Lapatto et al., 1989). The structure of recombinant bovine chymosin has recently been independently solved and refined at 2.3 A (1 A = @l nm) resolution (Gilliland et al., 1990). Crystallographic studies at 2-O A resolution have also been performed at Birkbeck on a site-specific mutant of chymosin, where Vail 11 was changed to Phe. and the structure has been refined to an R-factor of 19.5:/, (Strop et al., 1990). The molecules all display very similar secondary and tertiary struct,ures. Tn this paper we describe the refinement at 22 ?I resolution of wild-type bovine chymosin (EC 3.4.23.3). We give detailed analyses of internal symmetry, secondary structure, the act'ive-site geomet,ry, solvent structure and crystal packing. We bring together the most useful descriptions of the aspartic proteinase fold and emphasize their complementarity. To facilitate the comparisons, we use t,he pepsin numbering system for all residues in chymosin (for alignment)s. see Blundell et al., 1990).

factors, were applied as part of the Leeds diffractometer data processing suite (Korber, 1984). Data from separate crystals were scaled using the program SHELX-76 (Sheldrick, 1982). Data were collected on the mutant enzyme using a FAST electronic area detector diffractometer (EnrafNonius, Delft), enabling 2.0 A data to be collected from 1 crystal, as described in Strop et al. (1990). The reflection data (Table 1) were evaluated online using the program MADNES (Messerschmidt & Pflugrath, 1987). These were corrected for absorption effects (G. Oliva, H. Driessen & I. Tickle, unpublished results), and were scaled and merged using the method of Fox & Holmes (1966). In an attempt to reduce systematic errors incorporated into the wild-type dataset due to scaling the large number of crystals used for data collection purposes, the wild-type data were local-scaled to the mutant data according to the method of Matthews & Czerwinski (1975). The X-ray intensity data statistics after local scaling are presented in Table 1 (d) Molecular

replacement

Molecular replacement studies on chymosin were developed by Safro et al. (1985) using partially refined monoclinic pepsin co-ordinates (Andreeva et al.. 1984). The work resulted in the determination of rotational and translational parameters for the chymosin molecule in an orthorhombic unit cell and space group 1222, as indicated by the translation function interpretation. Unfortunately, in the refinement of this solution, incorrect signs for the translational components were applied. Both this solution as well as the correct solution gave good packing and refined to an R-factor of around 30%. As the positioning of the molecule in the unit cell was ambiguous. molecular replacement was repeated with a variety of starting models. For this work, the structures of the fungal enzymes endothiapepsin, penicillopepsin and rhizopuspepsin were used. as the refined co-ordinates of monoclinic pepsin were not yet available. All 3 enzymes had relatively low sequence identity with chymosin (in the range 20 to 300/,) and were thus not ideal for the search. Thus. it was decided to construct a hybrid model based on the fungal enzymes (A. Shearer. unpublished results). In an attempt to reduce the noise level introduced by the presence of variable loops on the surface of

the models. the searches were repeated using only the structurally conserved cores of the enzymes. All models were superimposed so that solutions in the rotation and translation functions would be easily comparable. For the rotation function, the model co-ordinates were placed in a hypothetical Pl cell with the molecules separated by 20 A for calculation of structure factors and E-values. The wild-type chymosin data were also converted to E-values. A number of cross-rotation functions were performed varying both the resolution limits of the data and the radius of integration in Patterson space (Crowther, 1972). A consistent peak was obtained for all values tried, but the highest value obtained was for data from 3 to 20 A and a radius of integrat'ion of 6 to 25 A (data not shown). Using these values for the radius of integrat,ion and resolution limits, the rotation function was repeated using all the search models (Table 2). Although the highest peaks occurred within a few degrees of each other, indicating that this solution was almost certainly correct, rhizopuspepsin gave the best result. When the conserved cores of the search molecules were used, the peak height/ r.m.s.t was increased (Table 2). The translational parameters were obtained for each of the search molecules by calculating a hemisphere of reflections to 2.5 a in the orthorhombic unit cell assuming Pl symmetry. This dataset was converted into partial F,s for each asymmetric unit and was combined with the wildtype chymosin F,s. Translations were then calculated using a modified T2 translation function with the self vectors excluded (Tickle. 1985). The 7'z-function maps were calculated for an octant of the unit cell (Ten Eyck, 1973). The translation function was performed over a wide range of resolution limits for both possible space groups (1222 and 12,2,21) to find the optimal values. A consistent solution was obtained for I222 using the resolution limits 3.5 to 24 A. Table 3 shows that the highest peak is consistent for all models using these resolution limits. This solution agreed with the rotational and translational parameters defined by Safro et al. (1985). No significant solution was obtained for the alternative space group I2,2,2, (data not shown). This solution was found to pack well when examined on

(e) Refinement
Restrained least-squares refinement was performed using the program RESTRAIN (Haneef et al., 1985). Initially, rigid body and then constrained/restrained refinement was carried out using medium resolution data. This resulted in a rotation and translation of the molecule by 1.7" and @15 A, respectively. A total of 2 separate refinement and model building, rounds of least-squares using data to maximal resolutions of 2.5 to 2.2 A, respectively, brought the R-factor to 3226. The weighting scheme of Cruickshank (1965) was used to give a uniform distribution of (w(:(IF,I-IF,~)`) (W is the weight) with respect to resolution and amplitude. Manual intervention required t,he use of electron density maps with Simweighted c0efficient.s 2lF,l- IF,1 and I$`01- IF=1 (Read. 1986). which were displayed using FRODO (Jones, 1978: modified by I. ,J. Tickle for PS2 graphics system). The electron density for the conserved regions was generali? encouraging, but density for the surface loops and most of the C-t,erminal domain was very poor. At this stage the co-ordinates for porcine pepsinogen (R-factor of 17% at 1.65 A resolution) were kindly provided by Dr ,J. Remington (Universit.y of Oregon). Pepsin has a sequence similarity of 589; with chymosin, facilitating interpretation and manual rebuilding into the electron density map. As a further aid t,o refinement, the mutant VlllF X-ray dataset was subsequently used. From Table 1 it can be seen that the mutant data are of better quality and higher resolution than the wild-type data. It was assumed that there would be only local changes around the mutated residue and that the 2 st)ructures would not differ globally. Thus, the mutated residue was replaced and this model was used for subsequent least-squares refinement. After 14 rounds of least-squares and manual rebuilding, involving 171 cycles of refinement refinement, the R-factor was 20%. The electron densit was generally good apart from the regions on the surface of the molecule. it, became apparent In the course of the refinement. that) there was some ambiguity in the interpretation of residues 74 to 77 which comprise the flap (a p-hairpin loop

that lies above the active-site). Thus. these residues werr refined with dual occupancy for 24 cycles. In retrospect. this ambiguity was because the Vail 11 to Phe mutation leads to a different position of t,he fly) in the mutant crystals (Strop et al.. 1990). This problem. together with the other ill-defined surface loops and the high noise level of the map. prompted the use of refinement with simulated annealing. The X-ray refinement molecular dynamics program X-PLOR (Briinger et nl.. 1989) was employed with the standard protocol (Briinger. 1988). resuming the use of the original wild-type chymosin X-ray data. Tpr75 situated on the flap was replaced by an alanine residue to In total. 3 residues avoid model bias in the refinement. that were previously missing in the loop 289 to 297 were inserted in reasonable conformations as alanine residues. The system was heated to 2000 K in a 1 ps simulation and was t.hen cooled Do 300 K over 05 ps. This result,ed in a drop in t.he R-factor to 18.8%. The r.m.s. deviation from the pre-X-PLORed structure for main-chain atoms and all atoms was 0.46 A and 088 A. respectively. The largest

deviations occurred in the poorly defined surface loops, especially in the region 289 to 297, where the main-chain carbon atom of residue 295 shifted 25 A. Several of the surface loops were still not well defined and so it was assumed that these regions were disordered. However, the flap residues were now situated inside well-formed electron density, indicating the correct position of the Tyr75 side-chain. After further cycles of restrained refinement, the final R-factor for 13,278 reflections between 22 and 10 A with IFI > Za(lFj) is 17 ye. The model displays good stereochemist,ry and has 136 water molecules included. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table 4. The refined coordinates have been deposited as dataset 2CMS with the Protein Data Bank, Chemistry Department, Brookhaven Sational Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, U.S.A., from which copies are available (Bernstein et al., 1977). The structure of the mutant chymosin was refined independently at a resolution of 2.0 A to a final R-factor of 19.54/, (Strop et al., 1990) and the co-ordinates are also deposited in the Brookhaven Data Bank as dataset SCMS.

3. Results
The structure of bovine chymosin refined to an R-factor of 17 y. at 2.2 8. The error in the atomic co-ordinates is 621 a (Table 4), as estimated using

the method of Read (1986), and the r.m.s. deviations from ideality for the stereochemistry are within acceptable limits. Typical portions of the 2(F,( - IF,1 electron density map are shown in Figure 1, displaying the overall high quality of the final map. However, some loop regions on the surface of the molecule were not clearly defined in the map. These include the amino terminus residues -2 to 1, and loops 8 to 13, 158 to 163, 239 to 244, 277 to 281 and 289 to 297. There is also a disordered region in the C terminus in the vicinity of a disulphide bond at 249 to 282. This has previously been noted to be one of the more mobile regions in hexagonal porcine pepsin (Cooper et al., 1990). In fact, many of the disordered regions are identical in the two crystal although they have crystallized in structures, different space groups. Thus, the disorder appears to be a property of the molecular structure and not primarily a consequence of the crystal packing. The static and thermal disorder are also evident in the B-values shown in Figure 2. The highest B-values are associated with the poorly defined loop regions on the surface of the protein. The mean B-value for the protein is 24 A2 for all atoms (Table 4). However, for the 194 atoms situated

These have torsion angles of SS", -93" and 117", respectively. There are also several ion-pair interactions within the chymosin molecule that are defined using a 4 A distance cutoff (Barlow & Thornton, 1983). These are between Arg59 and Asp57, Arg157 and Glu308, Arg157 and Ile326(COO-), Arg307 and Asp1 1, and Arg315 and Asp138.

The tertiary structure is characteristic of previously solved structures of aspartic proteinases (Fig. 3). The molecule can be divided into two lobes, comprising residues -2 to 171 and 172 to 326 (pepsin numbering). Between the two lobes, there is a 25 A extended cleft which contains the catalytic centre and the substrate binding pockets. The lobes are related by an approximate non-crystallographic I-fold screw axis which passes almost exactly between the two catalytic aspartate residues 32 and 215 (Fig. 4). The rotation and translation of this axis is 174" and @9 A. respectively. If t'hr N-terminal lobe is transformed onto the C-terminal lobe, 31 equivalences within 3.5 8, are found with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.5 8. The majority of these residues are found inside the active centre and core of the enzyme. The sequence identity between the two lobes (approx. 91<,) is less than that expected

Structure of Bovine Chymosin al., 1990). Intra-domain pseudo-diad axes in the N and C-domains of chymosin have rotations of 180" and 177", with negligible translations. As shown in Figure 4, the intra-domain axes are approximately related by the inter-lobe axis, all three being roughly co-planar. The N and C-domains are comprised primarily of j&sheets arranged in sandwich structures, where the direction of the component strands is approximately orthogonal in each sheet (Chothia & Janin, 1982). The N-domain is formed by a three-layered sandwich, whilst the C-domain is formed by only two. Packed between the layers of the sandwich are hydrophobic residues that form the hydrophobic cores of each domain. Helices pack against the edges of the sheets, contributing additional residues to the hydrophobic cores. (b) Secondary structure In the simplest description of the chymosin, a single strand is given the same nomenclature even though it may twist, fold and contribute to more than one sheet (Fig. 5). The nomenclature of Rlundell et al. (1985, 1990) is used to define a basic motif of four antiparallel B-strands (a, b, c, d) and a helix (h), which is repeated four times in the structure. Pairs of motifs are related by the intra-domain diads within the N and C-domains. These strands make up two well-defined sheets (1 and 2) that are packed orthogonally in each lobe. Each of the sheets is distorted in ways that differ in the two lobes (see below). A third sheet (3) is contributed by the N termini (a) and C termini (q, r) of each lobe to comprise a six-stranded antiparallel sheet (anr, rN, qN> qC? rC3 aC). Table 5 lists the sheet structure of chymosin with the notation of corresponding sheets and strands as defined by other workers for aspartic proteinases. Sheet 1, is a mainly antiparallel eight-stranded sheet. It is non-planar with one corner folded by 90" over the main body of the sheet. In fact, residues 70 to 82 (known as the flap), and 105 to 106, can be considered to form the separate three-stranded sheet 1; (Sielecki et al., 1990). In the C-domain, the equivalent sheet 1 is even more distorted and is split into a five-stranded sheet (1,) and a four-stranded sheet (1;). Sheets lh and 1;1 are not related by the inter-lobe symmetry. Within sheets IN and lc are pairs of interpenetrating $-structures (Tang et al., 1978) or wedding rings (Andreeva et al., 1985) that form the cores of the two respective domains. The @-structures display the highest degree of symmetry, with respect to both intra and inter-domain axes, which is presumably due to structural constraint imposed by the packing requirements in the core. They also contain some of the most invariant residues among the aspartic proteinases, including the active-site aspartate residues. However, the connecting residues between strands c' and d' are much more variable, comprising of a short helical segment in the N-domain, and a loop in the C-domain. This is

The main-chain hydrogen bonds are displayed as arrows in the direction of donor to acceptor. Only the residues belonging to /I-sheet (boxed) or to helix (encircled) are included. The large arrows indicate the direction of the st,rands. The inter-lobe and intra-domain symmetry axes are shown.

Sheets 2, and 2, are smaller four-stranded antiparallel b-sheets formed by folding the p-hairpins between b and c and between b' and c', under the main sheet so that they hydrogen bond between strands b and b'. In the N-terminal domain, sheet 2, is folded beneath 1, and, combined wit,h sheet

Helices are defined using the secondary st,ructure assignment program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983). t +,IJ angles are averaged over residues in the helix. The values in parentheses are the calculated sample standard deviations in 4.$ angles.

The central sheet (sheet 3) is formed by extending the N terminus of strand a, inserting an extra two strands (cl and r) after helix h', and then applying the inter-lobe diad symmetry to produce a sixstranded antiparallel p-sheet (Table 5). The sheet is the most regular in the molecule and displays a clear right-handed twist. There are six cr-helices in chymosin (Table 6), four of which (hN, hk, h, and hi) occur in topologically equivalent positions after the d strand in the basic motif. The fifth or-helix h,, occurs in one of the $-structures in the loop joining strand c;Y to d;Y, forming part of the primary specificity pocket, S,, whilst the sixth, hC3, belongs to a large insertion in the C-domain. Since a-helices are compact elements of secondary structure that, tend to move to accommodate changes in packing (Lesk & Chothia, 1980), no

helical residues were found to align in a superposition of lobes, domains or motifs. These packing rearrangements are accompanied by a, variation in the length of the connecting loops, both within the motifs in chymosin and among other members of the aspartic proteinase family. This has occurred at the distorted helix h,,, where the three-dimensional structure implies a correction in the usually accepted sequence alignment. A comparison of chymosin and pepsin with the fungal aspartic proteinases endothiapepsin and penicillopepsin reveals that there has been an insertion in the N-terminal loop and a deletion in the C-terminal loop of this helix. In a comparison of a,ll five solved aspartic proteinase structures, the only residue in the helix found to be topologically equivalent is 111, which occupies a position between specificity pockets S, and S3 (Strop et al., 1990). In all, 22 reverse turns that were not associated with 3,,-helices have been identified in chymosin by the presence of four to one hydrogen bonds. Seven of these turns were associated with distortions in a-helices. Of the 15 turns not associated with a-helices, the most common is type I (6/15), followed by type I' (4/15). Ten b-hairpin loops have been identified and are displayed (Table 7). All the short, 2 : 2 loops contain a b-turn of type I' or II' within the hairpin (Sibanda et al., 1989). The p-hairpin which links st'rand ab to b;y is a type II' turn, in agreement with the Gly residue in position i + 2 (Sibanda & Thornton, 1985). This loop is known as the flap and is situated above the active-site, forming part of specificity pockets S, and S;. In monoclinic porcine pepsin, this part of the molecule has an identical amino acid sequence, but has a different conformation due to close van der Waals' contacts with a symmetry-related molecule. The largest hairpin is the eight-residue disordered loop connecting q, to rN. Easily accommodated in

M. Newman et al. These appear t!o be necessary to hold the activr carboxylate groups in close proximity. The distance between Asp32 Odl and Asp215 06' is 3.1 A. Thr two inner oxygen atoms are involved in hydrogen bonds with nitrogen atoms of the conserved glycine residues, Gly34 and Gly217. These hydrogen bonds are typical of type 1 turns where an aspartate sidechain at i hydrogen bonds to the N-H group at i + L' (Wilmot & Thornton. 1988). Further hydrogctr bonds are formed by the outer oxygen atoms of 3% and 215 to the side-chains of Ser3.5 and Thr2lX. respectively. There is electron density wit'hirr hydroger,bonding distance of both carboxylate groups. l:rrder the conditions in which chymosin was cryst)allized, it is most likely that this corresponds to a wate! molecule. This is situated in the plane of the aarboxyla,te groups and is bound slightly asymmetrically towards Asp215 (Fig. 7). as observed in the structures of t,he fungal aspartics prot,einases (Suguna of al.. 1987h). Asp303 has been implicated indirec:tJy iu t htx mechanism of the aspartic proteinases. Th'is residurs is conserved among all enzymes that, have an acidic pH optimum. but is (ahanged to an alanine for t,htJ renins which are more active at neut,ral pH. Various mutagenesis experiments have been performed on this residue to est,ablish its role. In renin. it) has been mutated from an alanine to an aspartat,e residue and the resulting mut,ant enzyme has a lowered pH optimum (Yamaunhi et al.. 198X). and in cLhymosin the reverse experiment has been performed result ing in it raised pH optimum of 0.5 pH unit (Mant,afounis CIrf'itts. 1990). The carboxyl group ot 303 is involved in a possible hydrogen bond to t hr, carbon\-1 group of Thr21B (3.0 .A). shown in FigurcL 7. This implies that the side-chain group exists it, a protonatecl form. possibly effec+tinp t hr ph', ot' Asp215 r%r the peptide dipole of Thr2 I&(:ly217.

this loop is a type I b-turn between Asp156 and Gly159, which is stabilized by a salt bridge between Arg157 and Glu308. The size of this loop varies in all the aspartic proteinases. In porcine pepsin there is an insertion of one residue converting it to a 9 : 9 b-hairpin. (c) The active-sib The active-site is composed of the highly conserved triad of residues Asp-Thr--Gly from each lobe of the enzyme. These are sit'uated on equivalent corners of the Il/-struct'ures in t'he N and C-lobes, which are brought t,ogether around the inter-lobe diad axis in a complicated hydrogen-bonding network known as the "fireman's grip" (Pearl & Blundell, 1984) shown in Figure 6. Thr33 and its symmetry-related Thr216 are both situated at posit,ion i + 1 of a type I reverse turn that joins strand (sN to d, and cc t,o d,, respectively. The Oy' on the threonine side-chain forms two hydrogen bonds across the dyad axis to the main-chain of the symmetry related $-structure locking t'he two halves of the active-site in a rigid conformation. This results in t,he residues of the fireman's grip having some of the lowest temperature factors in the molecule ((Hi,,) = 12 A'). The glycine residues at positions 34 and 217 are all the members of t,he conserved throughout aspartic proteinase family, suggesting they play an important role. Gly34 and Gly217 have main-chain torsion angles of -94". -6" and --So, -14", which regions the respectively. are of Ramachandran plot that are not forbidden to other amino acids. The requirement for glycine residues at these positions appears to be due to the fact that the presence of side-chains would interfere sterically with the catalyt,ic aspartates. The necessity for missing side-chain groups also explains the invariant glycine residues at' positions 122 and 302, which are situated on the $-structures occupying positions adjacent to 32 and 215. The side-chains of Asp32 and Asp215 are also involved in numerous hydrogen bonds (Fig. 7).

Despite this high level of sequence identity, pepsin displays a higher proteolytic activity than chymosin (Martin et al., 1980), but has approximately the same milk clotting activity (at the pH optimum of rhymosin). (d) The substrate binding cleft

The specificity of chymosin is largely a consequence of the structure of the substrate binding sit,es, which have been identified by X-ray analyses of enzyme-inhibitor complexes with other aspartic prot,einases, e.g. endothiapepsin (Sali et al., 1989; Cooper et al.. 1987; Veerapandian et al., 1990). These the existence of wellstudies have demonstrated defined specificity sites from S4 to S; (Schechter & Berger. 1967). Tyr75 is situated on the flap above the active-site residues, forming part of specificity aspartate pockets S, and S; (Fig. 8). It is conserved in all eukaryote aspartic proteinase sequences, and in the structures previously determined, the position of this side-chain is invariant. However, the side-chain of Tyr75 in wild-type chymosin has rotated approximately 120" into the active-site cleft so that it blocks the entrance to primary specificity pocket
LN 81

S,. We have noted (Strop et al., 1990) that this rearrangement of the flap residues is not compatible with a productive mode of binding, but appears to be a consequence of crystal packing and will be discussed later. Further differences occur between chymosin and pepsin within the S; pocket. In chymosin, a fourresidue deletion has occurred in the loop joining strands CL to dh (289 to 297) which forms part of S;. The insertion of this larger loop in pepsin, including hydrophobic residues Met289 and Va1291, makes the S; pocket less open than in chymosin. However, in both enzymes the P; side-chain of a bound substrate molecule is more exposed than the P, side-chain, which is covered by the active-site flap residues. This possibly explains why S', displays less specificity than S, (Powers et al., 1977). Chymosin preferentially cleaves its natural Ic-casein, at only substrate, one peptide bond between Phe105 and Met106 (JolIPs et al., 1968). However, it possesses only moderately restricted specificity, as shown by its action on the B-chain of oxidized insulin (Foltmann, 1971). This implies that, there are interactions with the xc-casein molecule that are important for this enhanced specificity, other than at the primary binding sites. Tn chymosin B. there is a negatively charged

region on strand bh situated on the edge of the active-site cleft, consisting of Glu244 and Asp246. Additional negatively charged residues Asp248 and Asp250 are in close proximity. In chymosin A, Gly243 is mutated to an Asp, resulting in an increase in milk clotting activity of the enzyme by as much as 20 y0 (Foltmann, 1966). The natural substrate molecule, rc-casein, has positively charged residues between 97 and 102 (Arg-His-Pro-HisPro-His) which is close to the scissile peptide bond. It is possible that this negatively charged region on the chymosin molecule is involved in electrostatic interactions with the natural substrate molecule (Safro et al., 1987), resulting in an increase in catalytic efficiency by as much as two orders of magnitude (Visser, 1981; Carles & Martin, 1985). This negatively charged region is lacking in pepsin, which also displays no corresponding increase in catalytic efficiency with substrate chain length (Caries & Martin, 1985). Thus, chymosin has a level of milk clotting activity/general proteolytic activity that is approximately 20 times that observed for bovine pepsin (Martin et al.. 1980).

guity in the X-direction of the translation function could not be resolved by analysis of the crystal packing. Each molecule has eight nearest neighbours, but makes contacts less t.han 4.0 A4 with only seven of these, as the last is separated by a solvent channel at 1/2,y.1/2. There is a total of 195 unique nonbonded cont#acts, involving 68 different residues. There are 12 intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed with an average donor-acceptor distance of 3.1 A
(0.2).

An extensive number of int,ermolecular contacts involve strand bb of the active-site flap at residues Thr77, Ser79 and Gln81. It has been previously stated t,hat in chymosin the flap residues exist in a different conformation to that found in pepsin and other aspartic proteinases. This difference appears to be due to the presence of intermolecular contacts with the tip of the flap. However, the conformation of the flap residues is also affected in the specific-site of mutant VlllF (Strop et al., 1990). Substitution residue 111 by an amino acid with a much larger, but unbranched, side-chain group resulted in a conformational change in residues 72 to 79. Tt is assumed t.hat. in solution, with the removal of cryst,al contacts, the flap would take the usual conformation observed in other aspartic proteinase structures. (g) C:onservation and variation in chymosin
of residues

of which A total of 21186 of these are hydrophobic, nine are proline residues, often occurring in loops or before helices. In all, 11186 exposed residues are glycine, eight having positive 4 values. This is a greater proportion than for buried glycine residues, presumably because the absence of a side-chain is an important constraint for inaccessible residues, but less so for accessible ones. Only 17186 residues are involved in side-chain hydrogen bonds. This is a smaller fraction than for conserved buried polar residues, probably because water molecules can serve as hydrogen bonding partners. We are indebted to Dr C. Bunn for much of the early work on chymosin and for supplying the original chymosin crystals, and to A. Shearer (University College, London) for growing the pure rhymosin B crystals and building the hybrid chymosin model. Special thanks to Drs ,J. Cooper. S. P. Wood. G. Elliot and J.

Of the 188 invariant residues between chymosin and pepsin, only 16 are absolutely conserved in 24 eukaryotic aspartic proteinase sequences (Blundell et al., 1990). Nine of these are glycine residues indicating their important structural role. Other conserved residues are the catalytic aspartate residues at positions 32 and 215 (pepsin numbering) and Tyr75, which in previously solved structures hydrogen bonds to the conserved Trp39. Tyr14 is also strictly conserved. In chymosin, pepsin and the t,hree fungal aspartic proteinase structures, the sidechain hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain of Arg307. However, residue 307 is not absolutely conserved in other enzymes, but can be a Lys. Ser, Glu or Gly. The differences in environments of individual residues were examined. SS/lSS of the invariant residues between chymosin and pepsin are less than 7"/; inaccessible. Approximately half of these are non-polar, generally involved in forming the hydrophobic core. The remaining 38 conserved inaccessible residues are hydrophilic. A total of 21138 of these are involved in hydrogen bonds from their side-chain group. This illustrates the extra constraints imposed on buried polar side-chains by the need to satisfy their hydrogen-bonding potential. A total of 1 l/38 of the conserved buried hydrophilic residues are glycine, but only two of these have a positive 4. In all, SS/lSS of the conserved residues in chymosin and pepsin are exposed in both structures.
