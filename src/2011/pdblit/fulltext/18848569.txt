Abstract ° The single crystal structure of CaCl 2 ?C 5 H 10 O 5 ?3H 2 O was determined with Mr 5 315.16, a57.537(3), b511.426(5), c515.309(6) A, ° 3 , P2(1)2(1)2(1), Z52, m 5 0.71073 A and R50.0398 for 2322 observed reflections. The ribose moiety of the ° b 5 908, V 5 1318.3(9) A complex exists as a furanose with a-D configuration. All five oxygen atoms of the ribose molecule are involved in calcium binding. Each calcium ion is shared by two such sugar molecules, coordinating through O(1), O(2), O(3) of one molecule and O(4) and O(5) of the other. The C­C, O­H, C­O and C­O­H vibrations are shifted and the relative intensities changed in the complex IR spectrum, corresponding to the changes in bond distances and angles of the sugar structure. All the hydroxyl groups, water molecules and chloride ions are involved in forming an extensive hydrogen-bond network of O­H? ? ?Cl? ? ?O­H structure, and the chloride ions play an important role in the crystal packing.  2003 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction Interactions of calcium ions with carbohydrates have been implicated in biological processes such as calcium transport [1], calcification [2­4], cell­cell adhesion [5], binding of glycoproteins to cell surfaces [6] and interactions with glycolipids [7]. Interactions are more likely to occur on the surface of polysaccharides, but little is known about the factors involved in calcium­carbohydrate interactions, or the stereochemistry of the resultant complexes. Solution studies show that simple carbohydrates strongly bind calcium ions if they can provide contiguous axial­ equatorial­axial (ax­eq­ax) hydroxyl groups on six-membered rings or vicinal cis­cis-triol groups on five-membered rings [8,9]. The crystal structure of b-D-mannofuranose?CaCl 2 ?4H 2 O has proved the prediction and demonstrates that mannose binds calcium ions by a simple chelation process involving vicinal cis­cis-triol hydroxyl groups. It is, however, not clear what roles these calcium­ carbohydrate complexes play in calcium metabolism, but, as suggested by Charley and Saltman [10], they might

enhance calcium absorption either by serving as carriers that transport calcium across intestinal membranes or by inhibiting the precipitation of insoluble calcium salts within the intestine. Therefore, studying the calcium binding properties of simple carbohydrates would aid in the understanding of the structural factors involved in the interactions between calcium ion and polysaccharides, which is of particular significance. D-Ribose, as a component of nucleic acids, is an important pentose and is present in all organisms. It exists in solution as an equilibrium mixture of mainly six isomers. The `complexing' forms [9,11] represent altogether 43% of the ribose isomers, which is less than those for talose [12]. Solution studies show that D-ribose readily coordinates with Ca 21 and thus forms 1:1 complexes with different configurations in hydrophilic solvents [13]. However, the detailed three-dimensional structures of the complexes still remain obscure. Only one crystal of a ribose­metal ion complex has been determined (PrCl 3 ? ribopyranose?5H 2 O) [14]. But praseodymium is not an essential element in living things and the coordination ability of Pr 31 is greater than that of Ca 21 , therefore in biological fluids, the Ca 21 binding properties of D-ribose may not be the same as those of Pr 31 . In the present work,

we obtained a single crystal of CaCl 2 ?ribofuranose?3H 2 O from aqueous solution. Its crystal structure was determined and compared with that of PrCl 3 ?ribopyranose?5H 2 O, and the vibration spectrum assigned and interpreted in correlation with the crystal structure.

2. Experimental

2.1. Materials
D-Ribose (99.8%) was purchased from Acros and was used without purification. CaCl 2 (AR) was purchased from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Co., Inc, Tianjin, China, and was used as supplied.

2.2. Preparation of CaCl2 ? ribofuranose?3 H2 O
D-Ribose (0.75 g, 5 mmol) and equivalent amounts of CaCl 2 were dissolved in distilled water. Clear, prismatic crystals of CaCl 2 ? ribose?3H 2 O were grown by slowly evaporating the solution over a period of 7 months at room temperature. Elemental analysis: calculated for CaCl 2 ? C 5 H 10 O 5 ?3H 2 O: C, 18.462; H, 4.923. Found: C, 18.518; H, 5.247.

2.3. Physical measurements
The structure of CaCl 2 ?C 5 H 10 O 5 ?3H 2 O was determined on a Bruker Smart 1000 diffractometer using mono° chromatic Mo Ka radiation ( l 5 0.71073 A) in the u range from 2.22 to 24.998 at 293 K. The final cycle of full-matrix least-squares refinement was based on 2322 observed reflections. Calculations were completed with the SHELX97 program. The Crystallographic Information File (CIF) has been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre with number CCDC199656. The crystals of CaCl 2 ?C 5 H 10 O 5 ?3H 2 O were ground into powder and the FTIR spectra (4000­400 cm 21 ) of CaCl 2 ? C 5 H 10 O 5 ?3H 2 O and D-ribose were recorded on a Nicolet Magna-IR 750 spectrometer. The spectra were recorded as KBr pellets with a resolution of 4 cm 21 . and O(4) and O(5) of the other. In addition, three of the water molecules are coordinated to calcium through their oxygen atoms, labeled O(6), O(7) and O(8), giving a total of eight coordinating oxygen atoms for each calcium. The eight oxygen atoms coordinated to each calcium ion form a distorted square-antiprism with calcium­oxygen distances ° ranging from 2.368 to 2.538 A, and this coordination geometry is common for calcium­sugar complexes [15­ 17]. There are no hydrogen bonds between oxygen atoms within the calcium ion coordination shell and there are no direct contacts between Ca 21 and Cl 2 . In the title complex, the distances between the Ca ion and the oxygen atoms of the water molecules (Ca­W), shown by bond lengths Ca(1)­O(6), Ca(1)­O(7) and ° Ca(1)­O(8) (from 2.368 to 2.401 A), are significantly ° shorter than other Ca­O distances (2.483 to 2.513 A). These differences between Ca­W and Ca­O distances are generally found in Ca­carbohydrate complexes [18] and this may be interpreted as follows. The sharing of each Ca ion by two or more monosaccharide molecules is a common feature of Ca­sugar complexes [15­17], and such arrangements make steric effects significant. The sugar molecules with the coordinated hydroxyl groups in a particular geometrical arrangement cannot approach the Ca ion close enough for a steric effect, whereas the polar water molecules can freely approach the Ca ion due to their small molecular volume. As a result, the Ca­W distances are shorter than the other Ca­O distances. The ribose moiety of the complex exists as a furanose

3. Results and discussion

3.1. X-ray crystal structure
Crystal data are listed in Table 1. The structure and atom numbering scheme is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows a projection of the crystal cell in the crystal structure of CaCl 2 ? ribofuranose?3H 2 O. The atomic parameters of CaCl 2 ?ribofuranose?3H 2 O are given in Table 2. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are collected in Table 3. Each calcium ion is shared by two ribose molecules, coordinating through O(1), O(2) and O(3) of one molecule

with a-D configuration. All five oxygen atoms of the ribose molecule are involved in calcium binding. We note that the arrangement of the hydroxyl groups on C(1), C(2) and C(3) is very similar to the ax­eq­ax arrangement that has been found to favor complexing in six-membered rings. This coordination mode is different to that of PrCl 3 ? ribose?5H 2 O [14]. In the crystal structure of PrCl 3 ?ribose? 5H 2 O, the ribose moiety is a-D-ribopyranose, and only one ribose molecule is involved in each praseodymium binding. The differences may be mainly accounted for by steric factors. To meet the coordination number, the Ca ion is shared by two ribose molecules, and ribofuranose with a flexible hydroxymethyl is the best configuration for the Ca ion to form the stablest chelate rings; as far as the Pr ion is concerned, the coordination number of this ion is higher ° than that of the Ca ion, but its ionic radius (1.01 A) is ° therefore the ligands similar to that of the Ca ion (0.99 A), binding to the Pr ion are more crowded and one Pr ion cannot coordinate with two ribose molecules simultaneously, just as the Ca ion does for steric reasons. As a result, only one ribose molecule, in a stable configuration of a six-membered ring, is coordinated to each Pr ion, and the remaining coordination locations are occupied by water molecules and one Cl ion. As would be expected, there is an extensive network of hydrogen bonds involving hydroxy groups, water molecules and chloride ions, which appears to involve all of the hydrogen atoms that are covalently bonded to oxygen atoms. The sharing of the calcium ions between sugar molecules results in zigzag chains running parallel to the b-axis, with Cl ions among the chains. It is notable that

these Cl ions, distributed among the chains, are extensively hydrogen bonded to the water molecules and hydroxyl groups. It is by the extensive network of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds of type O­H? ? ?Cl? ? ? O­H that these chains are joined together and the whole packed crystal structure is thus formed (see Table 4). In the case described here, free Cl ions play important roles not only as the counterions but also as the necessary factor in the network of hydrogen bonds.

3.2. IR spectroscopy study of Ca­ribose
The FT-IR spectra of D-ribose and the Ca­ribose complex were recorded in the region 4000­400 cm 21 and the results for two different regions, 3600­2600 and 1800­ 400 cm 21 are discussed. Data from the FT-IR spectra of 21 D-ribose and the Ca complex are shown in Fig. 3. The absorption bands and tentative assignments together with those of Pr­ribose are given in Table 5.

3.2.1. Frequency region 3600 ­ 2600 cm 21 This region of frequencies is characteristic of O­H and C­H stretching vibrations. In this region, the free D-ribose shows two groups of absorption bands. The broad absorption band at around 3400 cm 21 can be assigned to the hydrogen-bonded OH groups. It appears broader in the spectrum of the metal complex (see Fig. 3). This observed spectrum change is due to the rearrangement of the strong hydrogen-bonding network from the intramolecular OH? ? ? OH system of free D-ribose to the intramolecular and intermolecular OH? ? ?Cl? ? ?OH system of CaCl 2 ?

C 5 H 10 O 5 ?3H 2 O observed in its crystal structure (see Table 4). The absorption bands at about 3000­2600 cm 21 are related to the C­H stretching vibrations of the free sugar. However, due to the possible overlap and the inherent width of some of the vibrational frequencies, only one absorption band at 2928 cm 21 is observed in the spectrum of free D-ribose. The C­H stretching vibration modes are observed in the spectrum of the Ca­ribose complex at 2996, 2954, 2890, 2861, 2811, 2718, 2645 and 2599 cm 21 and the intensities become weaker upon metalation. These bands are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric C­H stretching vibrations of the CH 2 group.

3.2.2. Frequency region 1800 ­ 400 cm 21 In this region, drastic spectral changes occur upon sugar metalation. The strong absorption bands at 1650 and 1617 cm 21 in the spectrum of the Ca 21 complex are assigned to

the bending motion of the coordinated water molecules. In relation to the spectrum of free D-ribose, the weak absorption band at 1634 cm 21 may be attributed to the bending motion of hygroscopic water. Several broad absorption bands with medium intensities in the region 1500­1200 cm 21 in the spectrum of free D-ribose are assigned to the deforming vibrations of the CH 2 angle. These broad bands exhibit intensity changes and split on sugar metalation in the spectrum of the complex. The broad absorption bands with strong intensities, at |1153, 1117, 1085 and 1042 cm 21 , in the spectrum of the free D-ribose, assignable mainly to the C­O stretching vibrations and C­O­H bending vibrations, show considerable changes (splitting and shifting) in the spectrum of the Ca­ribose complex (see Table 5). Such splitting and shifting are indicative of the participation of the sugar hydroxyl groups in metal­ ligand bonding, which affect the C­O stretching vibrations and C­O­H bending vibrations of the sugar moiety [19]. The ring skeletal deformation bands (d C­C­O and d C­C­C) of the free D-ribose, mainly in the region 1000­ 400 cm 21 , show considerable changes on complex formation (see Fig. 3 and Table 5). This may be taken as indicating distortion of the sugar ring upon metalation, although there are no crystal data for free D-ribose available to make a comparison with those of the complex. The spectral changes observed in this region may be interpreted as showing that metalation of the sugar perturbs the electron distribution within the sugar ring system where the vibrations are mostly localized, bringing about ring distortion and resulting in alterations to the spectrum. The weak absorption bands at 914, 887 and 872 cm 21 in the spectrum of the free sugar related to the C­C stretching vibrations [20] are observed to combine into one absorption band at 891 cm 21 in the Ca­ribose spectrum and the intensity become much stronger. However, in the

may be attributed to the different degrees of distortion of the sugar rings between the two complexes. As far as the Ca­ribose complex is concerned, the involvement of the ring oxygen in sugar metalation will produce significant distortion of the ring and thus affect the stretching vibrations of the C­C bonds of the sugar ring; but referring to the structure of the Pr­ribose crystal [14], the ring oxygen of the ribose moiety is not involved in sugar metalation, therefore the degree of deformation of the sugar ring may not be as great as that of the Ca­ribose complex. Other absorption bands at 825 and 795 cm 21 in the ribose spectrum are shifted towards higher frequencies, 827 and 812 cm 21 , respectively, in the spectrum of the Ca­ribose complex. These bands can be assigned to C­C­ O bending vibrations. The Ca­O stretching vibration [21] of the complex would occur at a lower frequency (400­200 cm 21 ) than those studied here. The IR results indicate that the hydroxyl groups of D-ribose take part in the metal­oxygen interaction, the hydrogen-bond network rearranges upon sugar metalation, and the D-ribose ring is distorted as a result of salt

formation. The IR results are in accordance with those of X-ray spectroscopy, and the FT-IR technique has proven to be a useful method for detecting the formation of such complexes.

4. Conclusions It is not clear what role the calcium­ribose complex plays in calcium metabolism, but calcium­carbohydrate interactions have been implicated in a variety of biological processes. Therefore, it is hoped that the specific structure of the calcium­ribose complex identified in this study will aid in our understanding of the structural chemistry of calcium interacting with polysaccharides. In the crystal structure of the calcium­ribose complex, one calcium ion is shared by two ribose molecules which provide five hydroxyl groups with specific geometrical arrangements as the dentates. It is reasonable to expect that, during calcium binding to polysaccharide moieties in biological systems, these dentates might be occupied by oxygen atoms from hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfate or phosphate groups with similar geometrical arrangements. It is therefore possible that such stereospecific interactions lead to the processes of gelation, calcification, and calcium-dependent cell­cell adhesion.
