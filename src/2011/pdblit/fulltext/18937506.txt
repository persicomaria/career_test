ABSTRACT: CYP105A1 from Streptomyces griseolus has the capability of converting vitamin D3 (VD3) to its active form, 1R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1R,25(OH)2D3) by a two-step hydroxylation reaction. Our previous structural study has suggested that Arg73 and Arg84 are key residues for the activities of CYP105A1. In this study, we prepared a series of single and double mutants by site-directed mutagenesis focusing on these two residues of CYP105A1 to obtain the hyperactive vitamin D3 hydroxylase. R84F mutation altered the substrate specificity that gives preference to the 1R-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 over the 25-hydroxylation of 1R-hydroxyvitamin D3, opposite to the wild type and other mutants. The double mutant R73V/R84A exhibited 435- and 110-fold higher kcat/Km values for the 25-hydroxylation of 1R-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1R-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme. These values notably exceed those of CYP27A1, which is the physiologically essential VD3 hydroxylase. Thus, we successfully generated useful enzymes of altered substrate preference and hyperactivity. Structural and kinetic analyses of single and double mutants suggest that the amino acid residues at positions 73 and 84 affect the location and conformation of the bound compound in the reaction site and those in the transient binding site, respectively.

Vitamin D3 (VD3)1 is produced from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin upon exposure to sunlight. It has no hormonal activity itself, but the dihydroxylated metabolite, 1R,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1R,25(OH)2D3), is hormonally active, mediating its biological effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Activation of the VDR in the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland maintains calcium and phosphorus concentrations in the blood and preserves bone mineral content. The hydroxylation of VD3 is catalyzed in two steps by CYP enzymes in humans and other mammals. The first step is the hydroxylation of the C25 position of VD3 to produce 25(OH)D3 (25-pathway in Figure 1) by mitochondrial CYP27A1 or microsomal CYP2R1 in the liver. The second reaction is the hydroxylation of the C1R-position catalyzed by mitochondrial CYP27B1 in the kidneys to

produce 1R,25(OH)2D3 from 25(OH)D3. Another mitochondrial enzyme, CYP24A1, metabolizes 1R,25(OH)2D3 by sequential monooxygenation to regulate the serum level of 1R,25(OH)2D3 (1). The industrial production of 1R,25(OH)2D3 from VD3 uses a bioconversion system of Amycolata autotrophica, which is one of the successful applications of the P450 reaction on the industrial scale (2, 3). The primary structure of the cloned gene indicated that the 25-hydroxylase of vitamin D3 is a water-soluble P450 named CYP105A2 (4). We found that Streptomyces griseolus CYP105A1 also has weak activities of both 25-hydroxylation and 1R-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 to produce 1R,25(OH)2D3 (5). Originally, this CYP was cloned by Omer et al. (6) as a sulfonylurea herbicidemetabolizing enzyme, P450SU-1, which shows a 55% identity of amino acid sequence with CYP105A2. Recent crystal structure analysis of CYP105A1 revealed that the substrate-binding pocket of CYP105A1 contains three arginine residues (Arg73, Arg84, and Arg193) (Figure 2). The Ala-scan mutation analysis suggested that these residues play key roles in substrate recognition (7, 8). Substitution of Arg193 to Ala (R193A) significantly reduced the activity. The crystal structure in the complex with 1R,25(OH)2D3 strongly suggests that a side chain of Arg193 interacts with the 3 -OH group of the substrate. In contrast, R73A and R84A showed much higher activity than the wild type, suggesting that Arg73 and Arg84 residues have an inhibitory effect on the activity.

In this report, we made a further attempt to enhance the vitamin D hydroxylation activity of CYP105A1 by mutating two Arg residues into various amino acids. Characterization of the enzymatic parameters revealed that one of those mutants exhibits 400-fold higher activity compared with the wild type. A unique mutant that prefers 1R-hydroxylation to 25-hydroxylation was also generated. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials.

Purification of Wild Type and Mutants of CYP105A1. The cytosolic fraction prepared from each of the recombinant E. coli cells was applied to Ni Sepharose (Bio-Rad Profinity IMAC Resins) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. After adsorption of wild type or mutant CYP105A1, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-120 mM imidazole in 20 mM TrisHCl buffer (pH 7.4). The eluted wild type or mutant CYP105A1 was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (EconoPack HTC-II; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). The wild type or mutant CYP105A1 that passed through from hydroxylapatite column was applied to a Mono Q 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). After adsorption of wild type or mutant CYP105A1, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 50-600 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Spectral Analysis. The reduced CO difference spectra of wild type or mutant CYP105A1 was measured with a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer with a head-on photomultiplier (Tokyo, Japan). The P450 content of the purified wild type or mutant CYP105A1 was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient of 110 mM-1 cm-1 at 417 nm (9). Measurement of the ActiVity. Each of the hydroxylation activities with vitamin D3, 1R(OH)D3, or 25(OH)D3 as a substrate was measured in the reconstituted system containing 0.2 µM enzyme, 0.1 mg/mL spinach ferredoxin, 0.1 unit/ mL spinach ferredoxin reductase, 1 unit/mL glucose dehydrogenase, 1% glucose, 0.1 mg/mL catalase, 1 mM NADPH, 0.5-10.0 µM substrate, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 mM EDTA at 30 °C. The substrates were dissolved in ethanol and added to the reaction mixture. The final concentration of ethanol in the reaction mixture was 1%. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat were calculated by the nonlinear regression analysis using the Kaleida-Graph (Synergy software). On the other hand, the reaction mixture containing 0.8 µM enzyme was used to observe a two-step hydroxylation of VD3. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected after varying time intervals and extracted with 4 volumes of chloroform-methanol (3:1). The organic phase was recovered and dried. The resulting residue was solubilized with acetonitrile and applied to HPLC under the following conditions: column, YMC-Pack ODS-AM (4.6 × 300 mm) (YMC Co., Tokyo, Japan); UV detection, 265 nm; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min; column temperature, 40 °C; mobile phase, a linear gradient of 70-100% acetonitrile aqueous solution per 15 min followed by 100% acetonitrile for 25 min for the analysis of the metabolites. Crystallization and Structure Refinement. The R84F mutant was crystallized in the reservoir condition of 16% PEGMME2000, 10% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.1), and 0.2 M NaCl using the same protocol as previously described (5). For the preparation of R73A/ R84A-product complex, 1R,25(OH)2D3 was dissolved at 6 mM in 60% ethanol and added to the purified protein (0.03 mM) in a 10-fold molar excess. The complex was kept on ice for 1 day and then concentrated to 0.3 mM. The R73A/ R84A mutant was crystallized in reservoir solution composed of 26% PEGMME2000, 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.2), and 0.2 M NaCl. All crystals have similar unit cell dimensions and molecular packing compared with the wild type enzyme (9).

The crystals were cryoprotected by transferring to the buffer consisting of the reservoir solution and an additional 25% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Quantum 210 CCD detector (ADSC) on BL44B2 at SPring8, Japan. All data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 program (10). The structure of R84A (PDB code 2ZBZ) was used as the starting model for the refinement. The model of the wild type enzyme was placed directly into the unit cell of the mutant and subjected to rigid body refinement and restrained refinement using REFMAC5 (11). The model was further refined with multiple rounds of manual rebuilding using Coot (12) followed by the restrained refinement. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. Other Methods. The concentrations of vitamin D3 derivatives were estimated by their molar extinction coefficient of 1.80 × 104 M-1 cm-1 at 264 nm (13). Docking experiments were performed by previously described procedures (9) using Autodock 4 (14). All figures of protein structure are prepared using PyMol software (http://www.pymol.org). The cavity in Figure 2 was calculated by VOIDOO program using the probe radius 1.4 Å (15) and protocol described in http:// xray.bmc.uu.se/usf/vis_tunnel.html. The least-squares superposition calculations for atomic models were performed by LSQKAB program (11). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Expression, Purification, Spectral Properties, and ActiVities of Wild Type and Mutants of CYP105A1. The crystal structure of CYP105A1 has suggested that Arg73, Arg84, Val88, Leu180, Val181, Arg193, Ser236, Ile243, and ILe293 comprise the substrate-binding site (9). We scanned these residues by substitution to Ala in the previous structural analysis. Of these mutants, V88A, L180A, V180A, R193A, and I243A showed significantly low or undetectable activity

FIGURE 3: HPLC profiles of vitamin D and its metabolites formed by wild type of CYP105A1 (A and C) and its mutant R84A (B and D). After incubation with 10 µM vitamin D3 for 0 (A and B) or 2 h (C and D), the reaction mixture was extracted and analyzed by HPLC as described under Materials and Methods.

(9), while R73A and R84A showed remarkably higher activities in the 25-hydroxylation and the 1R-hydroxylation than the wild type enzyme. From this point, we prepared a series of the single and double mutants of these residues (Arg73 and Arg84) and examined their enzymatic properties. The mutants of CYP105A1 we prepared in this study were expressed in the 1000-5000 nmol/L culture, similarly to the wild type enzyme, and were purified according to the procedure described elsewhere. All the enzymes thus purified were stable enough at room temperature for measurements of their activities and absorption spectra and for crystallization. As for the wild type enzyme, the mutants showed optical absorption spectra with a Soret maximum at 417 nm, indicating that the heme iron is in the ferric low spin state. These observations suggested that the mutation we introduced at the position(s) of Arg73 and/or Arg84 in CYP105A1 did not seriously disturb the active site structure. It is noted that all of crystal structures of the wild type and mutants of CYP105A1 with and without 1R,25(OH)2D3 had no water molecule coordinated to heme iron. We assume that exposure to X-ray may reduce heme iron as in the case of CYP2R1 (16). In the metabolism of VD3, 1R(OH)D3, and 25(OH)D3 by the wild type of CYP105A1, the dual metabolic pathways have been demonstrated, as shown in Figure 1. One is a conversion of VD3 to 25(OH)D3 and then to 1R,25(OH)2D3 (25-pathway), while the other one is a pathway via 1R(OH)D3 as an intermediate (1R-pathway). In the HPLC profiles of the VD3 hydroxylation by wild type CYP105A1 (Figure 3A,C), the amount of 25(OH)D3 is predominant as the product of this reaction, while very small amounts of 1R(OH)D3 and 1R,25(OH)2D3 are obtained, suggesting that the major pathway is the 25-pathway. Upon the mutation of the targeted residues of CYP105A1, the HPLC profiles of the metabolites (amounts and ratio) were dramatically altered, as shown for the R84A mutant (Figure 3B,D). Detailed analysis of the HPLC profiles to obtain their kinetic parameters (Tables 3 and 4) could evaluate the mutational

effect of Arg73 and Arg84 on the enzymatic activities and specificities of CYP105A1 in the VD3 activation. Enzymatic Properties of Arg84 Mutants. As shown in Table 3, we prepared the Arg84 mutants (R84Q, R84A, R84V, R84L, and R84F) and obtained the kinetic parameters (Km, kcat, and kcat/Km) of the 25-hydroxylation reaction of the 1R(OH)VD3 (the second reaction of the 1R-pathway) and of the 1R-hydroxylation reaction of the 25(OH)VD3 (the second reaction of the 25-pathway). The former reaction mimics the reaction of CYP27A1, and the latter does that of CYP27B1, both of which are natural VD3 hydroxylases in mammals. In the 25-hydroxylation of 1R(OH)D3, all the mutants show kcat and kcat/Km values much higher than the wild type. Of these mutants, R84A gives the highest kcat/Km value in this reaction, which is more than 30 times higher than the wild type enzyme. In the previous crystallographic study of

the wild type and R84A mutant, it was found that substitution of Arg84 in the first turn of B helix (Figure 2) to Ala did not affect the overall tertiary structure of CYP105A1, but the slightly open structure of the F helix is induced by loss of the interaction between the Arg84 side chain and the O on Ser183 (F/G loop). Since the Km values of wild-type and R84A mutant are comparable (Table 3), it has been suggested that some change in the gating mechanism affects the adaptability of the hydrophobic residues of the F helix (Leu180 and Val181) for substrate recognition during the hydroxylation of substrates by the ferryl oxygen, eventually enhancing the enzymatic activity. As the results in Table 3 show, kcat/Km values of four types of Arg84 mutant in the 25-hydroxylation are in the order of R84A > R84V > R84L > R84F, demonstrating that the hydrophobicity and the volume of the side chain at position 84 are critical for the activity. On the other hand, concerning the 1R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3, the R84F mutant exhibits the highest activity among all of the Arg84 mutants. This character is substantially contributed by a significantly high kcat and a remarkably low Km value for the 1R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3, showing its high catalytic activity and a high affinity for 25(OH)D3 of the R84F mutants of CYP105A1. The kcat/Km value for the 1R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3 was increased by 43 times upon the R84F mutation. As a result, it is also notable that the kcat/Km values of the 1R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3 are larger than those of the 25-hydroxylation of 1R(OH)D3; that is, the ratios of the 1R-hydroxylation to the 25-hydroxylation are 4.2 for the R84F mutants, in sharp contrast to 0.3-0.8 for the wild type and other mutants. Thus, the altered specificity of the R84F mutant mimics CYP27B1, which is a mammalian VD3 1R-hydroxylase (17). Previous studies on other CYPs suggest that the B and F helices are important for the control of substrate specificity (18). The above difference in enzymatic properties between R84A and R84F appears to be attributable to conformational differences of the substrate-access channel and substratebinding pocket. In the present crystal structural analysis of the R84F mutant in noncomplex form, it was found that the position of the B helix and the shape of the substrate binding pocket are significantly affected by the mutation compared with the wild type and R84A mutant (Figure 4). The room for 1R,25(OH)2D3 binding that has been observed in the R84A mutant is mostly occupied by the side chain of F84 in the B helix because the more ordered B helix shifts to tightly pack with the F helix, which may be the reason our attempt to cocrystallize the R84F mutant with 1R,25(OH)2D3 was unsuccessful. Although the precise mode of substrate binding in CYP105A1 is not yet known, the location of the F84 side chain may indicate the direct interaction to increase the binding affinity of 25(OH)D3 based on its low Km value (Table 3). The conformations of other potential substratebinding regions are also affected by the R84F mutation (Figure 4). Note that residues L180 and V181 in the F helix contact F84 by hydrophobic interaction. In addition, I293A294 of the loop region after the K helix is also affected and creates the space for binding of the compound. Thus, R84F bears the pocket structure that more resembles that of the R84A mutant in the complex with 1R,25(OH)2D3, rather than R84A in noncomplex form. These observations suggest

that the conformational changes within the active site pocket in the wide area result in the unique enzymatic properties of R84F. Enzymatic Properties of Arg73 Mutants. Upon substitution of the amino acid residues at position 73 of CYP105A1 (R73A, R73V, R73L, and R73F), the enzymatic activities of both the 25-hydroxylation of 1R(OH)D3 and the 1Rhydroxylation of 25(OH)D3 are increased, as shown in Table 3. This result is apparently similar to the case of Arg84 mutation. Of these mutants, both R73V and R73L showed an approximately 30 times higher kcat/Km value for the 25hydroxylation of 1R(OH)D3 than the wild type enzyme. The ratios of the 1R-hydroxylation to the 25-hydroxylation of the Arg73 mutants were 0.3-0.6. Even for the R73F mutant, the activity of the 25-hydroxylation is higher than that in the 1R-hydroxylation, showing that the effect of the Arg73 mutation is quite different from the Arg84 mutation. Enzymatic Properties of Arg73/Arg84 Double Mutants. Based on the results of single mutation on Arg73 or Arg84, we constructed three double mutants (R73A/R84A, R73V/ R84A, and R73V/R84F) to increase the activity in additive action. As expected, the three mutants exhibit higher 25hydroxylation activity for 1R(OH)D3 than any single mutant (Table 4 and Figure 5A). Double mutant R73V/R84A shows a 435-fold higher kcat/Km value for 25-hydroxylation than

the wild type. For the 1R-hydroxylation, the kcat/Km values of double mutants are also higher than those of any single mutant. The R73A/R84A mutant also shows a 319-fold higher kcat/Km for 25-hydroxylation. Figure 6 shows a crystal structure of R73A/R84A in complex with 1R,25(OH)2D3. Similar to the case of the R84A-1R,25(OH)2D3 complex, the 1R,25(OH)2D3 is bound to the transient binding site 12 Å from the iron atom along the I helix within the pocket. Although the difference in protein structure between the R84A-1R,25(OH)2D3 complex and the R73A/R84A1R,25(OH)2D3 complex is very small (rmsd of 0.3 Å), the atomic position of 1R,25(OH)2D3 shows rmsd of 1.1 Å. In particular, conformation of the aliphatic side chain of 1R,25(OH)2D3 is considerably different, suggesting that a loss of the Arg73 side chain influences the position and conformation of 1R,25(OH)2D3 and possibly the substrates to enhance the activity. We expected that the R73V/R84F mutant would show more 1R-hydroxylation activity than R84F. However, no further increase of 1R-hydroxylation activity was observed in R73V/R84F as compared with that of R84F, while 25hydroxylation activity was remarkably enhanced. The most interesting result in this study is the synergistic effect of substitutions of Arg84 and Arg73. Note that they locate in opposite sides of the substrate-binding site to sandwich the pocket as shown in Figure 2. It was proposed in the previous analysis that the substrate is initially bound to the observed binding site and then moves to a position that is suitable for metabolism (reaction site) (9). The amino acid residue at position 84 appears to have direct interaction with the compound in the transient binding site, and the indirect effect through the conformational changes of the other part of the active site pocket (i.e., the structure of the hydrophobic residues in the F helix and loop after the K

helix) and the change in the gating mechanism of the B and F helices. On the other hand, amino acid residue at position 73 appears to affect the conformation of the compound during the reaction within the active site pocket including transient and reaction sites. Thus, the contributions of different mechanisms by two residues lead to the remarkable increase of activities.

Hayashi et al. appear similar to those of 1R,25(OH)2D3. Thus, ES of R84A is significantly different from that of the wild type, indicating the changes of k1, k-1, k2, and k-2. Similar Kmapp and remarkably larger kcatapp values of R84A as compared with the wild type could be explained by the change of the k2 and/or k-2 value. As mentioned above, the adaptability of the hydrophobic residues of the F helix (Leu180 and Val181) of R84A for substrate recognition increases the stability of the ES complex and would decrease k-2/k2 to increase kcatapp as shown in eq 4. In addition, the change of position and conformation of the substrate in the ES complex could cause a large increase of k3. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the mutation of Arg84 to Ala causes conformational change of ES, ES, EP, and EP to affect most of the rate constants, and changes of k2, k-2, and k3 may contribute to the remarkable increase of kcatapp. The fact that the EP state of R73A/R84 including the position and conformation of 1R,25(OH)2D3 is different from that of R84A suggests that the ES state of R73A/R84 is also different from that of R84A. As shown in Figure 7, the position and conformation of the substrate in the ES state of R73A/R84 appears to be considerably different from those of R84A. These results strongly suggest that mutation at Arg73 significantly affects k3 to increase kcatapp. Thus, both mutations at positions 84 and 73 change many of the rate constants; however, it might be possible that the former mainly changes k2 and/or k-2 due to the change of the ES state, and then the latter mainly changes k3 due to the change of the ES state. If so, the synergistic effect of substitutions of Arg84 and Arg73 could be clearly explained by eqs 4 and 5. Another possibility is that distinct ES states among the wild type, R84A, and R73A/ R84A to determine k3 values are most critical. Because k3 contains a series of P450 reactions including first electron transport, O2 binding, second electron transport, O-O bond cleavage, hydrogen abstraction, rebound of OH group, and release of the product, further kinetic studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of the large increase of activity. Coupling efficiency between product formation and NADPH oxidation is another important point. Our preliminary results indicated that coupling efficiency of the mutants R84A and R73A/R84A is significantly improved from the wild type (data not shown), although those data are not sufficient to explain the large increase of activity. Comparison of R73V/R84A with NatiVe Vitamin D Hydroxylases CYP27A1 and CYP2R1. The activities of a wild type of CYP105A1 in metabolizing VD3, 1R(OH)D3, or 25(OH)D3 are much lower than the physiologically important vitamin D hydroxylases such as CYP27A1, CYP2R1, and CYP27B1. However, the double mutant R73V/R84A shows higher kcat/Km values for both 1R(OH)D3 25-hydroxylation activity and 25(OH)D3 1R-hydroxylation activity than CYP27A1 (25-hydroxylation of 1R(OH)D3: Km ) 6.9 µM, kcat ) 0.79 min-1, kcat/Km ) 0.11, 1R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3: Km )3.5 µM, kcat )0.021 min-1, kcat/Km ) 0.006) (19). In particular, the kcat/Km value of the double mutant for 25(OH)D3 1R-hydroxylation activity was 10 times higher than CYP27A1. In addition, R73V/R84A showed higher activity (turnover ) 1.3 min-1) than CYP2R1 ((turnover ) 0.8 min-1) at 10 µM of 1R(OH)D3 (20)). These results strongly suggest that R73V/R84A has a fine structure as a vitamin D hydroxylase.

Relationships between Crystal Structure and Kinetics. In this section, we try to correlate crystal studies with kinetic studies. The crystal study demonstrated that 1R,25(OH)2D3 is preferentially bound to the transient sites of R84A and R73A/R84A. When the substrate 1R(OH)D3 is also bound to the same site, enzyme reaction of the wild type and mutant CYP105A1 could be represented by a kinetic scheme shown in Figure 8, where ES and EP represent the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes at the transient site, respectively, while ES and EP represent the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes at the reaction site as shown in the docking model (Figure 7). When the concentration of the product [P] is much lower than the substrate [S], the initial rate V could be represented by the equation V ) kcatapp[E]0[S] / (Kmapp + [S]) where kcatapp ) k2k3k4k5 / {k4k5(k2 + k-2 + k3) + k2k3(k4 + k-4 + k5)} (2) and Kmapp ) k4k5(k-1k2 + k-1k3 + k2k3) / {k1k4k5(k2 + k-2 + k3) + k1k2k3(k4 + k-4 + k5)} (3) As k3 is considered to be much smaller than other rate constants, k-1, k2, k-2, k4, k-4, and k5, eqs 2 and 3 could be simplified as kcatapp ) k3 / (1 + k-2 / k2) Kmapp ) k-1 / {k1(1 + k2 / k-2)} (4) (5) (1)

Thus, the kcat and Km in Tables 3 and 4 correspond to kcatapp and Kmapp in eqs 4 and 5, respectively. We have obtained crystal structures of E (substrate-free enzyme) forms of the wild type, R84A, and R84F and EP forms of R84A and R73A/R84A. As mentioned above, comparison of E forms between the wild type and R84A revealed some change in the gating mechanism, which affects k1, k-1, k5, and k-5. When the release of the product is a rate-limiting step, increase of k5 could enhance the catalytic activity as shown in eq 2. The fact that a crystal of EP of the wild type has not been obtained while EP of R84A has been successfully crystallized suggests that the structure of EP of R84A is significantly different from that of the wild type. As described in our previous report, position and conformation of 1R(OH)D3 at the transient site of R84A

Vitamin D Hydroxylase Design from Crystal Structure of CYP105A1 CONCLUSIONS Very few chemical methods exist that directly hydroxylate aliphatic or aromatic C-H bonds, and most of them are not selective or of limited scope. Thus, biocatalysts such as P450s represent a promising alternative. Many published reports have been showing that actinomycete CYPs are practically useful for bioconversion and bioremediation (21-24). However, other applications have been limited by substrate specificity, low activity, and poor stability. To date, the most successful application of the P450 reaction on the industrial scale appears to be the bioconversion process for formation of pravastatin (an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, an LDLcholesterol-lowering drug) using a Streptomyces P450, CYP105A3 (25, 26). Protein engineering of CYPs has produced enzymes with altered substrate specificities, increased activity and stability. For example, our fusion technology between CYP and NADPH-CYP reductase remarkably increased the activity (27-29) and stability (30), and site-directed mutagenesis of CYP1A1 converted its function to a 2,3,7,8-TCDD-metabolizing enzyme (31). It is noted that our previous studies were performed without information on the tertiary structure of CYP. In this study, we used the information on the crystal structure of CYP105A1 in complex with 1R,25(OH)2D3 (9) to generate highly active vitamin D hydroxylase and confirmed the importance of tertiary structure to design highly active enzymes because we have obtained an excellent vitamin D hydroxylase in a short time. In conclusion, we successfully enhanced the vitamin D3 hydroxylation activity of CYP105A1 based on its tertiary structure. To our best knowledge, this is the first report showing a more than 400 times increase of CYP activity by site-directed mutagenesis. Structural analysis suggests that the altered properties of the enzyme are a result of the direct effect of substitution and indirect effect through the conformational differences in the B helix, F helix and loop after the K helix, which are coupled with an increase of hydrophobicity brought by mutations of Arg73 and Arg84 residues. The mutants are helpful for applying to the bioconversion process to produce 1R,25(OH)2D3 from vitamin D3. REFERENCES
