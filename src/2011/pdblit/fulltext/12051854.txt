Abstract The following review on galactosyltransferase (gal-T1) intends to cover genetic, biochemical, structural, biotechnological, cell biological and medical aspects of this enzyme in a comprehensive manner from discovery to the present day which have brought to light a genetic defect of this enzyme. Early work has only been included if it appeared relevant to ongoing issues. Following the evolution of a research topic over 40 years is in itself a fascinating endeavor as it permits to observe the ins and outs of hypotheses, fashions and errors. Gal-T1 is a beautiful example as it has been involved in almost every aspect of life science. Importantly, there is a future to this enzyme as a research topic, since many questions still remain unanswered: to which extent is it a representative Golgi protein? What is the role of the gene family of gal-Ts? Does gal-T1 exert any functions other than a catalytic one? Why is it phosphorylated? Does it form homodimers in vivo? Surely, there is room for further work, which is likely to reveal further insights into cellular trafficking and signaling and, in the context of the gene family, shall contribute to understanding development and morphogenesis. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS and Société française de biochimie et biologie moléculaire.

1. The early years Galactosyltransferase (gal-T1, E.C. 2.4.1.22/38) is an amazing enzyme: as we will see below, gal-T1 is known for its enzyme activity since over half a century; many papers have been written on its subject and, still, one of the most fascinating aspects, i.e. its dynamics as a genuine Golgi protein, is still poorly understood. Gal-T1 has been thoroughly investigated as an enzyme with its exceptional property to be modified by a-lactalbumin, by its association with the Golgi apparatus (GA), by its controversial roles as a tumor marker, cell surface component, adhesion and recog-

nition molecule and signal transducer. Most recently, a deficiency has been discovered which proves its importance in human physiology. This short introduction covers those aspects which were at the center stage in the 1960s and 1970s, before immunochemical and molecular approaches became available. The first demonstration that galactose residues are transferred into other molecules (acceptors) by an enzymic reaction has been provided by Watkins and Hassid [1]. They used particulate fractions from lactating mammary glands of guinea pigs and were able to demonstrate the transfer of galactose to the C-4 position of free D-glucose or, in nonlactating tissue extracts, to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). This work paved the way for the purification of lactose synthetase. This was achieved with some surprise and led to the discovery of the modifier function of a-lactalbumin: the purification of soluble lactose synthase from milk revealed two proteins designated A and B for the enzyme gal-T [2], and a-lactalbumin, respectively [3]. Subsequent work on the unique and interesting kinetics of this enzyme reaction (Fig. 1), which involves a modifier protein (a-lactalbumin), a donor substrate (UDP-Galactose), an acceptor substrate (glucose) and a metal ion (Mn2+) to yield lactose, has been reviewed by Hill and Brew [4]. At present, the mechanism of

modulation of substrate specificity by interaction with a specifier protein is still considered a unique feature. Thus, the long held hypothesis that the structural diversity observed in glycans may in some way result from similar interactions of glycosyltransferases with other specifier proteins is no longer tenable. In fact, recent data point to an unanticipated diversity of genes encoding closely related glycosyltransferases (see below), which by virtue of temporally and spatially restricted expression patterns, set the basis for the multitude of glycans encountered in a living organism. Work on lactose synthase in the early 1970s coincided with the first surge of interest in cell surface glycans of virally transformed and tumor cells which showed increased agglutinability with lectins over their normal counterparts [5]. These and similar reports [6] evoked considerable interest in biosynthetic pathways of glycosylation at a time when structural analysis of complex carbohydrates was tedious and fragmentary. An interesting hypothesis regarding the role of cell surface glycans was then promoted by Roseman [7], who proposed that glycosyltransferases could specifically interact with surface glycans by virtue of their specificity, provided that they would be localized on the cell surface. Some experimental support for the presence of the so-called ectogalactosyltransferase solely based on activity measurements was then provided [8], together with an intriguingly high activity of a soluble form of this enzyme in the fluid surrounding embryonic chicken brain [9]. These findings, in turn, prompted further work on the involvement of surface gal-T in diverse regulatory processes, such as cellular recognition [8], cell cycle dependent cell contacts [10], lectinmediated agglutinability [11], morphogenesis [12] and fertilization [13]. At that time, an approach to prove the existence of ecto-galactosyltransferase involved the use of insoluble acceptors [14-16], and provided some experimental support for their existence. In fact, Verbert used lymphocytes to demonstrate ecto-gal-T1; recent flow cytometric data using an monoclonal antibody (mAb) to gal-T1 indeed provided evidence for its presence on the plasma membrane of B-lymphoid cells [17].

Those were the days of the discovery of the medically important oncofetal antigens, such as $1-fetoprotein and the carcinoembryonic antigen [18]. Thus, circumstantial, not so solid evidence of gal-T1 being exposed on the cell surface, functioning as a lectin receptor, being especially active in early embryonic development, etc. led to its assignment as a cancer-associated enzyme [19]. Unfortunately, given the limitations of the assay methods, the lack of specific immunochemical approaches and limited knowledge of the enzyme structure, further work along these lines led to questionable results [20]. This form of gal-T1 designated isoenzyme II was in fact a slower moving peak of serum activity eluted from polyacrylamide gel slices and was never shown to relate to a different gene product; however, given the current state of knowledge about a gene family of gal-T1s (see below), such a phenomenon cannot be excluded, but would require re-evaluation using state of the art approaches. About at the same time, cell biologists began to develop interest in glycosylation, since this process appeared to shed light on the long sought raison d'être of the GA [21]. Indeed, several groups reported close association of gal-T1 with cellular fractions that resembled the GA cisternal stacks [22], thereby establishing gal-T1 as the marker enzyme of the GA. Besides its function in lactose and glycoprotein biosynthesis, gal-T1 attracted some interest as a model for studying GA membrane biogenesis, as will be discussed below.

2. The gene Cloning of the cDNA and the gene encoding gal-T1 initiated a new era as it permitted to elucidate its deduced amino acid (aa) sequence (Fig. 2) and delineate its domain structure. Cloning of bovine gal-T1 was achieved at the same time by Qasba and co-workers [23], using degenerate primers and by Shaper et al. [24] using an antibody to detect the clones in a kGT11 library. Furthermore, cloning permitted heterologous expression of the enzyme, which proved useful for production of the enzyme as a catalyst for synthetic work, for 3D structural analysis, for generation of protein-specific antibodies, and the discovery of a gene family of related proteins (see below). Genes can be tracked in public databases, such as www.expasy.org which lists annotated features of human, rat, bovine and murine orthologs of gal-T1. Moreover, the well known URL site http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/ provides comprehensive information on genomic and proteomic aspects. In fact, details on gal-T1 can be found at the following site: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/ LocRpt.cgi?l=2683. Another database specializing on the topic of glycosyltransferases can be found at http://afmb. cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/index.html [155] which allows direct access to the glycosyltransferase families using the E.C. number. This database is regularly updated. Data on tertiary structures of gal-T1 obtained by X-ray diffraction can be found at http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/.

Fig. 2. CLUSTAL W (1.82) multiple sequence alignment of gal-T1 cloned from different species as indicated. Sequence comparison was according to the BLOSUM62 aa substitution matrix, according to Henikoff and Henikoff [153]. The display thresholds for the alignment were used as follows: * identity; : high preservation of physico-chemical properties; . low preservation of physico-chemical properties. The sequences can be obtained by using the following accession numbers: P15535 (murine); Q99 PC2 (hamster); P15291 (human); P08037 (bovine); Q92074 (chicken) at the following website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=protein.

The gene encoding human gal-T1 has been investigated by Mengle-Gaw et al. [25], and found to span over 50 kb encompassing six exons. The gene organization is similar to the mouse gene but in contrast to the mouse and the bovine gene, it is expressed as a single transcript. The gene encoding gal-T1 is found in the genomic location 33438835-33495436 bp comprising 33.4 Mb on chromosome 9p13.3 and is also accessible by using the designation B4GALT1 at the URL site for the human genome project HUGO: http://www.citi2.fr/GENATLAS/gchr9p.html or by the accession number NM_001497 in Genbank. The surprising discovery of gene families for gal-Ts has been reviewed shortly before completion of the sequencing of the human genome [26], and afterwards [27]. Briefly, seven b14 gal-Ts have been described so far which are

highly homologous. All of them have already been known before the full genome had been sequenced. Thus, it seems unlikely that any additional related gal-T1 will be discovered in the human genome. What is the role of this redundancy? It was formerly believed that a glycosidic linkage would be specified by a single gene product (One gene-one linkage hypothesis): thus, any b14 linkage between galactose and GlcNAc or glucose would be catalyzed by a single gene product more as the acceptor specificity of gal-T1 appeared not to depend on any other feature of the acceptor substrate [28]. A tentative answer can now be given through investigations of acceptor specificities of the several gal-Ts as well as by comparing the 3D structural features that accommodate them (see below). In addition, comparisons across species reveal residues nec-

essary for conservation of function (Fig. 2). The subtle, and in some cases, profound differences in acceptor specificity (e.g. gal-T7 recognizing xylose [29,30], or gal-T6 recognizing glucosylceramide [31]), together with spatially and temporally restricted expression patterns, provide countless possibilities of galactosylation reactions. Thus, the gene family almost certainly provides a further molecular basis for phenotypic variability. 3. The protein It is every biochemist's dream to purify the enzyme of his research focus to a purity which stands the litmus test of allowing to obtain monospecific antibodies and an interpretable N-terminal sequence. Fortunately, gal-T1 was not an intractable case. At the time of the invention of affinity purification [32], gal-T1 presented itself as an interesting candidate as it was known to interact with donor and acceptor substrates as well as with $-lactalbumin. Several groups took advantage of these properties to pioneer powerful purification schemes which included the use of immobilized $-lactalbumin [33,34], UDP [35], and GlcNAc [35], attached to agarose by hexyl spacers involving cumbersome chemical synthesis. An easily synthesized GlcNAc-agarose bead [36], combined with sequential chromatography on $-lactalbumin turned out to be an efficient procedure for the isolation of milligram amounts of soluble gal-T1 from several sources, such as human milk, amniotic fluid and malignant ascites [37]. In addition to these matrices, hydrophobic chromatography was also successfully used [38]. While bovine milk was the richest and cheapest source for gal-T1, the enzyme was also purified from other fluids and tissues as indicated in Table 1. Some of the above cited work proved useful in further developing knowledge on gal-T1. Most importantly, the purified enzyme was used to elicit mono- and polyclonal antibodies and provided sequence information for cloning its cDNA as outlined above [23,39]. In addition, a wealth of data is

available on structure/function relationship. Considering the breakthrough achieved by Gastinel et al. [40] and Ramakrishnan and Qasba [41] for studying the 3D structure, most of the early data retain merely some historical value as progress reports and are not cited here. The translation of the cDNA provided the linear sequence of aa of gal-T1 as shown in Fig. 2 and revealed the general domain structure of glycosyltransferases (for review, see [42]). This also applies to gal-T1: it is a type II monomeric membrane glycoprotein facing the cytoplasm with a short N-terminal domain, spanning the membrane with one transmembrane domain which is extended luminally by a stem region and the C-terminally located catalytic domain. Bovine and human gal-T1 have been recognized to be glycoproteins much earlier [37,43]. Glycosylation of the human enzyme has been more thoroughly investigated and found to contain a core fucosylated bi-, or triantennary (perhaps even tetra-) glycan with high structural multiplicity; notably, LeX epitopes are found in the milk enzyme, whereas gal-T1 as purified from serum appears to lack fucose [44]. Moreover, soluble human milk gal-T1 contains a variety of O-glycans that are substituted with core 1 and core 2 type structures. These latter can be extended with polylactosamine repeats and may carry blood type antigenic epitopes [45]. This precludes the use of polyclonal antibodies raised against blood group containing antigens with respect to immunohistochemistry [46]. A peculiar feature of gal-T1 concerns its extensive heterogeneity, due in part to charge differences leading to 8-13 isoforms by isoelectric focusing [37,39,47], and to size differences as a result of proteolysis with low specificity [48,49]. Since the genetic basis of gal-T1 has been elucidated as a single polypeptide (though with heterogeneous aminotermini of the soluble form), charge heterogeneity must be related to post translational modifications. In fact, gal-T1 expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is homogeneous following deglycosylation [50]. Another post-translational modification of gal-T1 is phosphorylation [51] on serine residues occurring probably on the

cytoplasmic side since little phosphate was detectable in soluble forms. This interesting aspect has, to our knowledge, not been investigated further. 4. Immunochemistry of gal-T1 Monospecific antibodies are invaluable tools in cell biology as they are indispensable for localization and trafficking studies (see below) as well as cloning by screening a kGT11 library [24]. Conservation of the gal-T1 catalytic portion of the protein among species explains its poor immunogenicity which precluded the identification of specific antibodies by conventional detection tests, based on precipitating immune complexes, such as immunodiffusion. Fortunately, as the discovery of affinity chromatography was timely for protein purification at the end of the 1960s, tests for the detection of non-precipitating antibodies, such as ELISA [52] were timely at the end of the 1970s and permitted to detect such antibodies to affinity-purified human gal-T1 by binding [53]. As will be discussed below, antibodies have been widely used and were developed in many laboratories (Table 2). Some epitope mapping has been carried out using a panel of mAbs [54,55], confirming the stem region as the major site of immunogenicity as this portion is least conserved among species. Moreover, the use of mAbs permitted to delineate the species of gal-T1 secreted by ovarian cancer: since gal-T1 is cleaved within the stem region before secretion, variant forms may arise by different cleavage sites. In the case of ovarian cancer, a longer stem region has been identified by an mAb specifically reacting with a part of the stem region normally not present in supernatants [54]. An interesting recent application is the use of mAb to determine the amount of intracellular GA-associated gal-T1 by flow cytometry [17]. A problem of special importance in applications to immunohistochemical work was the presence of blood group epitopes on gal-T1 that proved to be immunogenic in rabbits [46,56]. These problems were overcome by injecting gal-T1 expressed in Escherichia coli, thus as nonglycosylated immunogens [57]. 5. 3D structural analysis Gal-T1 has always been a fascinating protein because of its highly specialized binding sites that have to accommodate

the donor substrate (UDP-Gal) in the presence of complexing divalent cations (Mn2+), the acceptor substrate (free or aglycone bound GlcNAc) and the interacting protein $-lactalbumin. The most interesting aspect concerns the modification of acceptor substrate specificity from GlcNAc to glucose following binding of $-lactalbumin [2]. This unique feature (which is, in fact, shared with gal-T2) explains mammary gland-restricted synthesis of lactose due to specific expression of $-lactalbumin in the lactating mammary gland. It also highlights the other role of gal-T1, i.e. chain elongation of the glycan moieties of glycoprotein regardless of their type (in fact, gal-T1 is able to elongate all GlcNActerminated glycans, whether N- or O-linked). Due to these interesting functional properties, many reports appeared on structure-function relationships using approaches of affinitylabeling, e.g. [58], photoinactivation [59], cross-linking [60], labeling of functional groups [61] and more recently, on site-directed mutagenesis [62] to test the involvement of defined aas. Some of these results need re-evaluation in the light of current knowledge based on 3D analysis. Successful crystallization followed by X-ray diffraction analysis at 2.4 Å [40], and 2.0 Å [41] of gal-T1 permitted to gain insight into the molecular dynamics of substrate binding and hence to validate previous analyses. However, no activity data of the enzyme preparations used for crystallization have been reported. Using a recombinant form of the catalytic portion of bovine gal-T1 (starting at Pro114), followed by expression in a mammalian cell line (NSO cells), thus presumably glycosylated, Gastinel et al. [40] were able to obtain crystals in the presence and absence of UDP-Gal. They found a new fold like a cone with a deep open pocket of 13 Å at its base. This pocket accommodates UDP-Gal by binding to four sequence motifs: D252VD, WGWGGG317DD1, (the underlined residues have later been shown to interact with galactose directly [63]) PF(H)R189XR, F226NRA (see Fig. 3). In the absence of UDP-Gal, UMP was found to be associated with this pocket but surprisingly formed interactions other than UDP. The location of galactose or the position of the acceptor substrate or the groups interacting with $-lactalbumin could not be delineated at this stage. This structural insight was broadened by X-ray diffraction analysis of crystals obtained by Ramakrishnan and Qasba [41]. The catalytic domain of bovine gal-T1 (starting at Ser130) was expressed in inclusion bodies

[40] and Ramakrishnan and Qasba [41]. The crystals were obtained by heterologous expression of cDNA encoding bovine gal-T1 starting at P114 [40] or S130 [41].

of E. coli (thus non-glycosylated) followed by renaturation and complexed with murine $-lactalbumin to obtain crystals of the lactose synthase complex. Inference from kinetics and cross-linking studies predicted the need for either a donor or acceptor substrate for a stable complex formation. While the overall structure of gal-T1 reported by Gastinel et al. [40] was confirmed and designated conformation I, a new conformation was observed following the binding of UDP-Gal (conformation II) with respect to aa 345-365 [63]. Here, the acceptor binding site is exposed and forms an $-helix (aa 359-365) which interacts with the acetyl moiety of GlcNAc. The crystals obtained in the presence of $-lactalbumin revealed a predominantly hydrophobic interaction between gal-T1 and $-lactalbumin [41]. Binding of the acceptor sugar, GlcNAc or Glc, was similar (Fig. 3) and involved residues close to the carboxyterminus. The extended acceptor binding

site is located as an open canal behind the GlcNAc binding site and accommodates oligosaccharides but is blocked by $-lactalbumin. This explains the higher affinity of gal-T1 to oligosaccharides vs. GlcNAc and also explains why underlying peptides of the acceptor sugars have little influence. Modeling studies then showed that $-anomeric GlcNAc moieties do not fit, whereas b-GlcNAc accommodates easily, whether it is located on a 16 or 13 branch of a biantennary glycan. The aa forming the extended oligosaccharide binding sites show some significant variations among the b4gal-T family members; this forms the molecular basis for the subtle substrate specificity differences observed among these members (for review see [27]). Somewhat surprisingly, the famous D252XD motif which appears suited for coordinated binding of divalent cations involves Asp254 only. The second metal binding site of lower affinity accommodating

either Mn2+ or Ca2+ could not be assigned. A model on how gal-T1 transfers galactose from UDP-Gal to the acceptor substrate has then been proposed based on the 3D structural findings: first, gal-Ts binds UDP-Gal and Mn2+ in its open conformation designated I as described by Gastinel et al. [40]. Thereafter, the enzyme changes to conformation II by moving the stretch of aa 345-365 thereby uncovering the acceptor as well as the $-lactalbumin binding sites and locking UDP-Gal in the pocket. Interestingly, homodimerization of gal-T1 has often been observed under certain circumstances, e.g. as an active enzyme peak eluting before serum albumin by gel filtration, in pulse-chase analyses of radiolabeled cells (our unpublished data) or by light scattering analysis of soluble recombinant forms [50]. Crystals showed dimers formed by eight intermolecular hydrogen bonds between b-sheet-10 (Fig. 3) arranged in an antiparallel fashion. This implies that homodimers (i) can be formed; (ii) that they are active since the catalytic pocket faces the external side; (iii) they are easily broken in the presence of SDS, and (iv) they are formed independently of the catalytic, transmembrane and stem domains and thus also observed after intracellular proteolytic processing (see below). 6. Recombinant forms and heterologous expression Section 5 already pointed out that heterologous expression was instrumental in obtaining enough crystallizable protein to gain insight into the structure of this enzyme. On the other hand, gal-T1 might also serve as a useful catalyst to tag terminal GlcNAc residues and to synthesize oligosaccharides. The first application had been suggested very early on when it became clear that glycosyltransferases could serve as analytical tools to specifically tag their acceptor substrates [64]. This application led to the discovery of O-linked GlcNAc [65], a regulatory protein modification of nuclear proteins like phosphorylation [66,67]. Incidentally, by using gal-T1 as an analytical tool on thin tissue sections, nuclear proteins could be specifically labeled [68]. Another seminal finding using gal-T1 as an analytical tool was the discovery of the cytoplasmic orientation of the dolichol linked chitobiose, an early intermediate of the N-glycosylation pathway [69]. Another application of recombinant gal-T1 pertains to the enzymic synthesis of the galb1 4GlcNAc linkage in glycoconjugates. For this purpose, mass amounts of functionally pure gal-T1 are warranted. Several expression systems have been developed, including E. coli [70-72], S. cerevisiae [50,73,74], P. pastoris [75], insect cells [76], COS-1 cells [77], as well as COS-7 cells [78]. The highest level of expression was reported in S. cerevisiae reaching 5000 U in a 300 l fermentor by using a feedback-controlled fed-batch process [79]. In this case, an engineered form to avoid N-hypermannosylation was produced. However, as in most cases, downstream processing methods to obtain the enzyme in a reasonably pure form was not worked out. Industrial applications of natural or recombinant gal-T1 for large-scale synthesis are still hampered by cost factors due to

the donor substrate for which an interesting recycling system has been described [80], but which has not entered routine application in enzyme technology. In most cases, recombinant gal-T1 was shown to have properties similar to the natural counterpart, except for hypermannosylation in S. cerevisiae which prevented recognition by antibodies. 7. Medical aspects With respect to gal-T1, two main domains are of relevance: first, gal-T1 has been used in clinical chemistry as a tumor marker and, second, loss of function of gal-T1 may be relevant in either congenital or acquired disease. In clinical chemistry, serum gal-T activity determinations have been carried out to monitor tumor development in a variety of cancer types. We summarize these data as they are of limited and mainly historical interest: some promising data have been obtained in following ovarian cancer patients [81,82]. With the advent of the powerful marker CA 125, serum gal-T determinations have no longer been found to be useful [83]. Refinements of crude activity determinations included isoelectric focusing of serum activity which produces a characteristic pattern of isoforms in purified enzyme preparations [37], as well as in body fluids [84,85]. Since these isoforms reflect post-translational modifications [50], a cancer-specific variant could, in fact, exist as a result of some alteration in glycosylation. Whether this explains the so called isoenzyme II of gal-T originally proposed by Podolsky and Weiser [19] and later followed up by Uemura et al. [86] or whether this isoenzyme II corresponds to another representative of the gal-T gene family remains to be seen. Other aspects concern possible acquired defects of gal-T1 activity. An intriguing consistent finding was undergalactosylation of IgG in cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [87], which led to an explosion of research on the possible causes. Although at the beginning, gal-T1 was suspected to be downregulated [88], further determinations of gal-T1 protein in B lymphocytes of RA showed levels similar to control cells [89] in line with similar mRNA expressions levels [90]. Therefore, the enzyme activity could be somehow hindered perhaps by displacement from its regular site of activity. Considering the quite specific effects of some of the GA disturbing agents (monensin, nigericin, bafilomycin) on galT1, this possibility needs to be envisaged. The toxic effects of chronic alcohol intake have also been made responsible for underglycosylation of hepatic glycoproteins [91] by impairing galactosyl- and sialyltransferase activities. Recently, an inborn error of metabolism affecting gal-T1 has been discovered which broadens the list of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) by adding CDG type IId [92]: the patient suffered from hydrocephalus, extensive muscular hypotonia, myopathy with kreatine kinase leakage, transient cholostasis, coagulation abnormalities and general failure to thrive. The enzyme was found to be truncated by 50 C-terminal aa by an insertional mutation (1031-1032insC), leading to frameshift and premature stop. The flexible loop

268

involved in GlcNAc binding was therefore lost together with putative lectin-like activity. The myopathy recalls related findings in muscle-eye-brain disease and Fukuyama congenital muscle dystrophy [93] since it is known that the O-mannosyl glycan attached to $- dystroglycan is also elongated by b14 linked galactose. A block of synthesis of this glycan leads to impaired binding to the extracellular matrix causing dystrophy [94]. 8. Localization and trafficking The GA is the main localization of the gal-T1 which is functional in chain elongation of glycans of newly synthesized secretory and membrane glycoproteins passing through this organelle (see above). Prior to the cloning of the enzyme, it was discovered by cell fractionation and autoradiographic studies that the activity of gal-T1 was enriched in GA fractions (for review see [22]). On analyzing the incorporation of radioisotopes of rat thyroid lobes by light microscope radioautography and electron microscope radioautography, Whur et al. [95] could demonstrate that the incorporation of [3H]galactose was initially localized to the GA and then disperses to vesicular structures. The localization of gal-T1 activity in the GA was further confirmed by a detailed in situ analysis of surface mucous cells of the rat stomach [96]. A definitive answer concerning the localization was achieved using affinity-purified antibodies against soluble human milk gal-T1 in immunofluorescence (Fig. 4) [53] and immunoelectron microscopy experiments [84]. At the resolution of fluorescence microscopy, the localization of gal-T1 was visible as a clearly defined juxtanuclear staining pattern. Further

refinement of the localization by electron microscopy on ultrathin sections revealed that gal-T1 is localized to a subcompartment of the GA, the trans most 2-3 cisternae. All of the above studies established the localization of gal-T1 within the GA, which can thus be regarded as a marker of this compartment. Later, Geuze et al. [97] could identify gal-T1 to some extent in the trans Golgi network (TGN). Immunocytochemistry on ultrathin frozen sections of human hepatoma cells (HepG2) revealed gal-T1 specific staining not only in the TGN, but also specifically within coated structures in that area suggesting an exit pathway of gal-T1 involving coated vesicles. Besides the main localization of the gal-T1 in the GA, it has been suggested that a portion of the enzyme is present at the plasma membrane (for early review see [12]). This has been observed for a variety of primary cell cultures, sperm cells, tissue sections as recently reviewed [98], but less so in cultured cells. However, surface staining does not appear to be a general phenomenon, but rather cell type specific as gal-T1 is restricted to the trans-GA in bovine epithelial cells with no surface staining except in a subpopulation of tracheal cells [99]. At the cell surface, gal-T1 is thought to function as a kind of lectin which binds to terminal GlcNAcresidues present either in the membrane of an adjacent cell or as part of the extracellular matrix. Shur and colleagues [100] reported that it is specifically the longer form of the gal-T1 containing a 13 aa N-terminal extension which is found at the cell surface. An interesting proposal for a function associated with surface expression of gal-T1 is its possible association with signal transduction, leading to transient tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin [101]. In addition to the localization of gal-T1 at the GA and at the cell surface, it has been reported that up to 2-3% of the intracellular gal-T1 are secreted per hour in HeLa cells [102], which might result from post-GA processing. Although a part of gal-T1 is located in post-GA sites, its major localization is nevertheless within the GA. Therefore, cells face the challenging task of retaining or retrieving gal-T1 (together with other resident enzymes) in the GA despite the large flow of proteins and lipids through this organelle. All the glycosidases and glycosyltransferases cloned so far have very little sequence homology, which suggests that GA retention/retrieval signals are not linear aa sequences, but most likely involve general features of the proteins [103,104]. As mentioned above, the only feature that all GA glycosyltransferases share is their type II membrane orientation. Work from several groups suggested that a GA retention mechanism of gal-T1 is based on features which require its transmembrane domain [105-109]. However, some data also indicated an involvement of other domains, including the cytoplasmic tail for correct GA localization [107,110,111]. The evaluation of these results is complicated due to experimental variables which include: chimeric proteins constructed using different reporter proteins, high and low-level expression systems, the use of different cell types and the use of different detection methods. Taken together, it

seems likely that the general characteristics of the transmembrane domain, such as the hydrophobic length and/or the presentation of uncharged polar residues are responsible for GA retention. Two different models have been suggested on how the transmembrane domains could serve to mediate the retention within the GA: the `kin recognition' model [112] or a lipid based model concerning the bilayer thickness [104,113]. According to the `kin recognition' model, the enzymes of a particular cisternae oligomerize and therefore form large structures that cannot enter vesicles. It was further suggested that the immobility is enhanced by interaction with a putative matrix located between the stacks [114]. In the particular case of gal-T1, the kin recognition model could in fact be of importance since 3D analysis has brought the formation of homodimers to light (see above). According to the lipid sorting model, the GA enzymes partition differentially between the cisternae due to the incorporation of sphingolipids and associated sterols, which create distinct lipid domains discriminating individual cisternae. This model is based on the observation that the localization of the GA enzymes is still correct if the transmembrane domains are replaced by `synthetic' domains consisting only of leucine residues and that the length of the `synthetic' transmembrane domains determines retention in the GA (17 residues) or delivery to the plasma membrane (23 residues) [115]. In the past few years, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been extensively used as a new tool to study the subcellular localization mobility and transport routes of gal-T1 as a marker of the GA in living cells [116,117]. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments allow the quantitative determination of the mobile fraction of fluorescent proteins and their diffusion constant. In these experiments, fluorescent molecules in a small region of a cell are irreversibly photobleached by intense illumination and subsequent movement of non-bleached fluorescent molecules into the bleached region from other areas of the cell is monitored by imaging at low-level illumination. In a very elegant study using GFP-tagged GA proteins (gal-T1, Mannosidase II (Mann II), and KDEL receptor), Cole et al. [118] could show that 90% of the molecules are very mobile with a high lateral diffusion coefficient (0.3-0.5 µm2/s). This implies that these GA proteins, although perhaps occurring as homodimers, are not trapped in aggregates formed by heterooligomers as suggested by the kin recognition model. Furthermore, the filling of the bleached regions was not affected by reduced temperature or ATP depletion, indicating that it was due to lateral diffusion within the plane of the GA membranes rather than vesicular transport [118]. In contrast, treatment with AlF, which causes irreversible binding of peripheral protein complexes (including COPI) to GA membranes, led to a complete immobilization of gal-T1-GFP chimerae, indicating a potential interaction of gal-T1 with peripheral GA proteins [118]. Monensin and brefeldin A are further GA disturbing agents that have been used to analyze the trafficking of gal-T1 (for review see [119]). Monensin is a carboxylic

ionophore binding Na+/H+ and transporting them across biological membranes [120,121]. An immediate effect of monensin upon addition to cells is the swelling of GA cisternae, which is even visible by light microscopy [122]. The presence of cholesterol enhances the transport of Na+ by monensin but does not affect the transport of protonated monensin [123], which might explain a differential effect of monensin on proteins in trans-GA membranes (cholesterol rich) vs. cis-GA membranes (low cholesterol). A series of publications has shown that GA proteins are affected differently by monensin treatment, on one hand, gal-T1 [124], $1,3 fucosyltransferase 6 (fuc-T6) [125], GPP130, GP73 [126] dissociate from the GA and co-localize with proteins that cycle through endosomes (cation-insensitive mannose-6phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), TGN38/46) and on the other, $2,6sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I), Giantin, Mann II, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GalNAc-T2) remain associated with the GA [127, 128]. The reason for this different trafficking behavior is unclear. BFA is a fungal metabolite that inhibits nucleotide exchange onto ARF and leads to a loss of ARF1 and COPI binding to membranes [129,130]. This blocks exit out of the ER and leads to a proliferation of tubules extending out from the GA which ultimately fuse with the ER [130]. Using a gal-T1-GFP construct, it was shown that the protein (and lipid) contents were transferred very rapidly from the GA via this tubular network into the ER [131]. Such a rapid and unidirectional transfer from the GA to the ER upon fusion through tubules suggests that the GA membranes exist in a higher energy environment than the ER membranes. That the recycling of gal-T1 between GA and ER also occurs without the addition of drugs was demonstrated by a variation of the FRAP experiments called fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP). In cells expressing gal-T1-GFP, either GA or ER was selectively photobleached in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent de novo protein synthesis. Zaal et al. [132] found that the pool of gal-T1-GFP either within the ER or within the GA recovers from bleaching in about 20 min. Using a kinetic model, these data imply that the overall time of gal-T1-GFP to cycle between GA and ER was about 90 min. Taken together, gal-T1 is clearly a bona fide marker for the GA in all its localization and trafficking features. However, general statements about the organization or other properties of the GA should not be drawn solely from experiments carried out with gal-T1, as it is obvious that there is quite a variation among different GA proteins. Hence, data on mitosis in which gal-T1 has been used as the only marker to trace Golgi elements [132] need to be re-evaluated. 9. Gal-T1 deficient mice and some thoughts on redundancy Considering the many biomedical aspects in which gal-T1 has been involved, it is not surprising that two groups developed knock-out mice [134,134]. While both the groups re-

ported viable but growth retarded mice, Asano et al. [133] found them to be fertile, rendering a crucial involvement of gal-T1 in sperm-egg recognition unlikely as postulated by Shur and colleagues [135]. Furthermore, gal-T1 deficient mice were found to have increased rates of epidermal and mucosal cell proliferation [133]. Incomplete glycosylation was also the reason for pituitary insufficiency [134], as the glycohormones of the anterior lobe were not able to stimulate their receptors. Of note is the different phenotype of gal-T1 knock-out mice and the case of CDG IId. For this particular human inborn error, knock-out mice appear not to be a disease model. This discrepancy may be related to the still poorly understood role of the other gal-Ts in terms of redundancy, substrate specificity and expression pattern (for review see [136]). As reported above (Section 2), gal-T1 is no exception in being a member of a family of related glycosyltransferases. Similar families have been brought to light for almost all glycosyltransferases [154]. What is the biological significance of this apparent redundancy? Redundancy may be a misnomer since all glycosyltransferases have different albeit overlapping specificities. One possibility concerning the biological significance in vivo shall be addressed although it is quite speculative but amenable to experimental verification: There is increasing evidence from developmental biology that complex carbohydrates including glycosylaminoglycans contribute to morphogenesis and patterning [155]. When we consider the following points: (i) the countless possibilities to create isomeric structures of glycans by virtue of different glycosidic linkages, anomericity and branching, (ii) the temporally and spatially regulated expression of glycosyltransferases, (iii) their differences in fine specificities for various acceptor substrates, and (iv) their relative activities that may differ to some extent in different individuals depending on their (hitherto largely unknown) polymorphisms, the apparent unlimited diversity of biological patterning may be directly related to structural diversity of complex carbohydrates. These could also explain the multitude of physiognomic appearances in a single species as these, well known to all of us, are specifically inherited as monozygotic twins exemplify.

10. Outlook We are confident that the reader has been convinced that gal-T1 has been thoroughly investigated. Is there anything that remains to be learnt? Particularly the sections on the genes encoding the family of b4gal-Ts, the phenotypes in knock-out mice and CDG, the trafficking of gal-T1 are matters for ongoing and future research. In this context, recycling vs. secretion of gal-T1, the role of processing for secretion, its putative involvement in signal transduction and the function of phosphorylation seem worth further exploring.
