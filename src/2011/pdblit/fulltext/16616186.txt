The Dbl family of oncogenes
Richard A Cerione* and Yi Zhengt
Genetic screening and biochemical studies during the past products for which the Dbl proteins

few years have led to the discovery of a family of cell growth regulatory proteins and oncogene oncoprotein exchange is a prototype. These putative guanine nucleotide

exchange factor (GEF) for the human homolog of Cdc42, Cdc42Hs; Dbl stimulates the activation of Cdc42Hs via the exchange of bound GDP for GTP [4]. GEFs for the small GTP-binding proteins (also known as G proteins) act in a manner analogous to that of ligandactivated seven transmembrane domain receptors, which in essence serve as GEFs for trimeric G proteins: they exhibit their highest affinities towards the guaninenucleotide-free state of the GTP-binding proteins and promote GDP release by stabilizing this intermediate transition state. The current thinking is that Dbl and related proteins activate Rho-like GTP-binding proteins. The Rho-related proteins include the mammalian Cdc42Hs, Racl and Rac2, Rho A, Rho B, and Rho C, RhoG and TClO, and yeast Cdc42, Rhol, and Rho3; all of these GTPases play important roles in mediating various cytoskeletal reorganizations in cells. Genetic analysis of bud-site mutants revealed that Cdc42 is involved in yeast bud-site assembly [5], most likely by mediating an actindependent polarization process during budding. Cdc42Hs has been shown to stimulate the formation of filopodia in Swiss 3T3 cells in response to bradykinin [6*,7*], whereas Racl is required for lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling induced by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [S], and RhoA is responsible for the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion plaques [9]. More recent evidence that should help us understand more clearly the relationship between the GEF activities of the Dbl family members and the cell growth regulatory roles played by members of the Rho family GTP-binding proteins is starting to accumulate. This evidence is discussed in this review,

Introduction
The &i oncogene was identified in 1985 by Eva and Aaronson by transfection of fibroblast cells with DNA from a human diffuse B-cell lymphoma [l]. Proto-&/ was subsequently found to encode a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that was unrelated to any other oncogene, or proto-oncogene, product known at the time [2]. Amino acid sequence analysis [3] revealed that a region in the central portion of the proto-Dbl protein shared considerable similarity with the Saccharornyces cenvisiae cell division cycle protein Cdc24, which was thought to play an essential role, together with the Rho-like small GTP-binding protein Cdc42, in the yeast bud-site formation process. This result led to the discovery that the oncogenic Dbl protein acts as a guanine nucleotide

Proto-Dbl is an 115 kDa cytoskeleton-associated protein found in limited tissue locations, including the brain, adrenal glands, testis, and ovary. Oncogenic activation of Dbl occurs as a result of an amino-terminal truncation of proto-Dbl, leaving residues 498-925 fused with the product of an as yet unidentified gene which is localized on chromosome 3. Proto-Dbl was found to share three regions of sequence homology with other cytoskeletal or signaling molecules. A stretch of -300 amino acids in its amino-terminal half shows a repeat pattern of seven residues similar to that found in the intermediate filament protein vimentin; this region probably forms an cl-helical coiled-coil structure. This domain may play an important role in growth regulation (perhaps by acting as a negative constraint) because a deletion mutant of Dbl that lacks the first 497 amino acids is a potent oncoprotein (Fig. 1). A second region found between residues 498 and 738 of proto-Dbl, which is retained

by oncogenic Dbl, was first found to share significant sequence similarities with the S. cmvisiae cell division cycle molecule Cdc'24 and the breakpoint cluster gene product Bcr. This region, later refined as residues 498-674 of proto-Dbl and designated the Dbl homology (DH) domain, was shown to be responsible for the GEF activity of the Dbl oncoprotein [lo*] and to be critical for its transforming function [3]. The third region of homology in proto-Dbl, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (residues 703~812), was identified through computer alignment with other signaling molecules. Although poorly conserved, PH domains appear to adopt a common three-dimensional structural motif as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance [ 111 and X-ray crystallography studies [12]. Together with the DH domain, the PH domain is present in all members of the Dbl-like GEFs (see below) and is thought to be essential for the proper cellular localization of the Dbl proteins. In the case of oncogenic Dbl, the PH domain is required (together with the DH domain) for its transforming function, but is not involved in the interaction of Dbl with small GTP-binding proteins (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the PH domain seems to play a role in mediating cellular transformation by targeting Dbl to specific cytoskeletal locations to activate Rho family small GTP-binding proteins (Y Zheng, D Zangrilli, RA Cerione, A Eva, unpublished data).

Identification of a family of Dbl-like guanine nucleotide exchange factors
Since the initial identification of Dbl as a GEF for Rho-type GTP-binding proteins, a growing number of oncogene products and growth regulatory molecules have been shown to contain a DH domain in tandem with a PH domain (Table 1). Many of them, such as Bcr, Cdc24, SOS, Ras guanine nucleotide release factor (GRF), and Vav, have been implicated in cell growth regulation. Others, including Ect-2, Ost, Tim, Lbc, Lfc, and Dbs, were discovered, by virtue of their transforming capability, through gene transfer methods. FGDl, the gene responsible for faciogenital dysplasia (Aarskog-Scott syndrome), was isolated from the human X chromosome by using a positioning cloning strategy [ 131; the T cell tumor invasive gene product Tiam-1, which appears to directly influence the invasive capacity of T-lymphoma cells, was identified during the screening of invasive T-lymphoma variants that were induced by proviral insertions [14"]. Among these putative GEFs, Cdc24 has been demonstrated, by both biochemical and genetic means, to function as the physiological activator for Cdc42 in S. cerevisiae, by catalyzing the exchange of GTP for GDP [15,16]. The Lbc oncoprotein was shown to be a specific GEF for Rho and to cause cellular transformation

through a Rho-signaling pathway [ 171. The osf oncogene product, which shares over 70% sequence identity with Dbl in its DH domain, shows GEF activity for Cdc42Hs and RhoA in vitro, and, furthermore, is capable of binding to the GTP-bound form of Racl [18]. The Ect-2 oncoprotein is not capable of catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange on any known mammalian Rho family GTP-binding protein, but can bind tightly to RhoC and Racl [19]. The Tiam-1 protein was found to be an active GEF for Racl and Cdc42Hs and is capable of inducing Rat-mediated membrane ruffling in fibroblasts [ZO]. Although the biochemical properties of the FGDl gene product remain unknown, insertion of a single base pair into the corresponding DH domain yields a DH domain truncated aberrant product that was shown to correlate with Aarskog-Scott syndrome [13]. The hematopoeitic cell type specific vav oncogene product has been suggested

to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange activity on Ras following T-cell or B-cell activation [Zl]. This came as a surprise, given that Vav does not have the Ras-activating Cd&S-homology motif which has been found in all other Ras-specific GEFs, but contains instead a DH domain followed, in the carboxy-terminal direction, by a PH domain. Contradicting data have since suggested that Vav may act through Rho family small GTPases in a manner similar to that of the Dbl protein [ZZ].

Possible multifunctional GEFs

roles of the Dbl-like

In addition to the DH and PH domains, most Dbl-family members contain other types of functional domains that are commonly found in signaling molecules (Fig. 2). The Racl-specific and Cdc42Hs-specific GEE Tiam-I, contains two PEST (single-letter code for amino acids) do-

mains, which have been associated with protein instability, near the amino-terminal end of the molecule, in addition to an extra PH domain [14**]. The Rho-specific Lbc oncoprotein possesses a putative Caz+-binding EF-hand motif at its amino terminus [23]; the Vav, Lfc, and FGDl proteins share a potential diacylglycerol-binding zinc butterfly motif [24]; and the Dbs and Vav molecules both have Src homology (SH)3 domains at their carboxyl

termini [25]. Abr, together with its closest homoiog Bcr which has been implicated in human leukemias, contains an additional Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) homology domain that is active as a negative regulator for Racl and Cdc42 [26]. Perhaps the most interesting proteins in this family are the Ras GRF [27] and SOS [28], both of which were recognized for the activating effects on Ras that are mediated by their

220

Ceil regulation

carboxy-terminal Ras GEF motifs. The fact that both Ras GRF and SOS also contain DH domains suggests that they may act as two-headed exchange factors by mediating the activation of both Ras and Rho small G protein signaling pathways. All these observations are consistent with the possibility that the formation of multimolecular signaling complexes, involving additional domains in these GEFs, is necessary for efficient cell growth regulation.

Upstream signaling

Signaling

pathways involving Dbl-like GEFs

Unlike the signaling cascade in which the Ras GEF SOS participates, which is thought to involve tight binding of SOS to the adaptor molecule Grb2 and translocation of SOS to the cell surface to activate Ras in response to growth factors, the signaling cascade coupling Dbl-like GEFs to the upstream components remains elusive. Moreover, the specific biological functions of many of the Dbl family members have yet to be determined.

In Swiss 3T3 cells, growth factor receptor activation triggers a hierarchical signal flow from Cdc42 to Rat and then to Rho [6*]. Ras has been suggested to act between the activated receptor and Rat to stimulate membrane ruffling [8]. It has also been demonstrated that Rat acts downstream of Ras in mediating cell transformation [29]. In addition, the bradykinin receptor and the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor, which belong to the seven transmembrane domain heterotrimeric G protein coupled receptor family, activate Cdc42Hs and RhoA (see Fig. 3a), thereby stimulating formation of filopodia and focal adhesions, respectively [7*,8]. Thus, the missing links between the receptors and the small G proteins must include trimeric G proteins in addition to Dbl-like GEFs.

It has been shown, in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, that the G-protein subunits Gal2 and Gal3 can specifically stim-

Such stimulation results in the activation of particular Rho family small GTP-binding proteins (RholRaclCdc42) at specific intracellular locations as directed by the PH domain in the GEFs.

assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in a Rho-dependent manner [30]. Analogous to the case for the Ras activator SOS, receptor-initiated signals may cause the transient translocation of Dbl-like GEFs to the close proximity of a specific type of Rho protein, via the recruiting function of the PH domains, and may also lead to direct stimulation of the GEF activities of Dbl-like proteins by alleviating possible constraints imposed on the molecules by the additional domains (e.g. because of the vimentin-like domain of proto-Dbl, such a constraint is imposed when the amino-terminal half of the proto-Dbl folds over the carboxy-terminal half and blocks access to G proteins). In addition, Cdc24, the physiological GEF for the S. c~-~isiae Cdc42 protein, may be directly linked to the pheromone receptor coupled heterotrimeric G protein signaling cascade of the mating pathway (Fig. 3b). In particular, there is evidence from yeast two-hybrid studies to suggest that the amino-terminal half of Cdc24 can directly bind to the By subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins [31], and that the carboxy-terminal region of Cdc24 binds tightly to another protein essential for bud-site assembly, Bern1 [32,33].

realize that the DH domain is essential for GEF activity, and that the function of the PH domain is mainly to target the catalytic DH domain to specific cellular locations. Comprehensive studies of each individual member of this family are obviously necessary to determine whether this conclusion can be generalized. The structural features of each combination of DH domains and PH domains, which enable the GEFs to couple to specific Rho family proteins and to be susceptible to selective regulation, represent important issues for study in the future. The multiple domains found in many Dbl-like GEFs may well suggest additional modes of regulation for the individual GEF activities and possible convergence of multiple signaling pathways. The identities of possible links between various upstream components, be they ligand-activated receptors, Ras, or Rho family proteins, with members of the Dbl family are being intensively studied. Whether a direct phosphorylation event, a particular lipid metabolite (i.e. a product of a PI kinase or of phospholipase AZ), or a direct protein interaction (i.e. with trimeric G-protein subunits) can stimulate GEF activity and/or cause intracellular translocation of the GEF (leading to the activation of specific Rho proteins) should prove to be exciting. Meanwhile, more detailed definition of the function of each DH domain is required to identify the specific small G protein that is activated by an individual GEF, and further characterizations of other regulatory molecules and downstream targets of the Rho proteins such as GAPS, GDP-dissociation inhibitors, and kinases will provide a more comprehensive picture of intracellular signaling networks involving the Dbl-like GEFs.

Downstream

signaling

Among the currently known members of the Dbl-like GEF family, Cdc24, Tiam-1 and Lbc are the only proteins that have been shown to act as physiological regulators for Rho-type GTP-binding proteins, namely for Cdc42, Rat, and Rho, respectively. The Dbl, Ost, and Ect-2 oncoproteins, which display GEF activities or binding affinities for multiple Rho-type G proteins, have yet to be further examined in ~1~0, and specific functions for other Dbl-like proteins need to be uncovered or clarified. Consistent with the role of Dbl as a Cdc42Hsspecific GEF in viva, it has been demonstrated that in Dbl-overexpressing fibroblasts, Jun kinase (JNK) activity was stimulated in a manner similar to the stimulation obtained with a constitutively activated Cdc42Hs mutant [34",35**,36-381. The realization that activated forms of both Rho and Rat can be oncogenic [29,39] provides additional links between the transforming nature of many members of the Dbl and Rho families of GTP-binding proteins. It is likely that the recently identified Rho family effecters such as protein kinase N (PKN) [40], p65P*K serine/threonine protein kinases [4144] and/or phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinases [45,46] will serve as further downstream signal transducers of the GEFs to activate the JNK or other intermediate components that elicit effects on transcription or actin cytoskeletal reorganization (Fig. 3a).
