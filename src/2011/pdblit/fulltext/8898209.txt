Phosducin induces a structural change in transducin bg
Andreas Loew1, Yee-Kin Ho1, Tom Blundell2 and Benjamin Bax3*
Background: Phosducin binds tightly to the  subunits (Gt) of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin, preventing Gt reassociation with Gt­GDP and thereby inhibiting the G-protein cycle. Phosducin-like proteins appear to be widely distributed and may play important roles in regulating many heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathways. Results: The 2.8 Å crystal structure of a complex of bovine retinal phosducin with Gt shows how the two domains of phosducin cover one side and the top of the seven-bladed  propeller of Gt. The binding of phosducin induces a distinct structural change in the  propeller of Gt, such that a small cavity opens up between blades 6 and 7. Electron density in this cavity has been assigned to the farnesyl moiety of the  subunit. Conclusions:  subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins can exist in two distinct conformations. In the R (relaxed) state, corresponding to the structure of the free  or the structure of  in the  heterotrimer, the hydrophobic farnesyl moiety of the  subunit is exposed, thereby mediating membrane association. In the T (tense) state, as observed in the phosducin­Gt structure, the farnesyl moiety of the  subunit is effectively buried in the cavity formed between blades 6 and 7 of the  subunit. Binding of phosducin to Gt induces the formation of this cavity, resulting in a switch from the R to the T conformation. This sequesters  from the membrane to the cytosol and turns off the signaltransduction cascade. Regulation of this membrane association/dissociation switch of Gt by phosducin may be a general mechanism for attenuation of G protein coupled signal transduction cascades.

Introduction
G protein coupled receptors are involved in many signaling processes [1], one of the best understood being the photoexcitation of retinal photoreceptor cells. The absorption of a photon by rhodopsin converts 11-cis-retinal to the all-trans form, thus causing changes in the relative positions of the seven transmembrane helices [2]. The activation of rhodopsin promotes nucleotide exchange on transducin (Gt), the heterotrimeric G protein in the rod outer segment of the photoreceptor cell. The  subunit of transducin, Gt, is converted to the active GTP-bound form (Gt­GTP) and dissociates from the  subunit of transducin (Gt). Gt­GTP then activates the latent cGMP phosphodiesterase, which reduces levels of cGMP and causes cGMPsensitive channels in the plasma membrane of the rod outer segment to close. The cell then hyperpolarizes, thus converting a light signal to a neural signal that can be transmitted to the brain. The hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP converts the  subunit back to the inactive GDP-bound form, Gt­GDP, which can then reassociate with the  subunit to form Gt­GDP­. The heterotrimeric complex Gt­GDP­ is then ready to be activated by rhodopsin again. The activation of a single rhodopsin molecule can lead to the activation of many hundreds of molecules of transducin and, in dark-adapted cells, to a neural impulse.

Phosducin, a 28 kDa cytosolic phosphoprotein, is expressed at a level similar to that of transducin in the retinal photoreceptor cells [3]. In light-adapted photoreceptor cells unphosphorylated phosducin interacts with free Gt, thereby blocking the reassociation of Gt­GDP with Gt [4]. Because a single activated rhodopsin molecule can activate up to 500 molecules of Gt­GDP­, depletion of the pool of free Gt­GDP­ attenuates the amplitude of the signal. In the dark-adapted state phosducin is phosphorylated by protein kinase A at Ser73, which leads to reduced affinity for Gt and favors the formation of the heterotrimeric Gt­GDP­ complex. The amplitude of the signal from a single activated rhodopsin receptor is also regulated by the intracellular calcium concentration; this alters the speed at which activated rhodopsin is turned off by phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase (and the subsequent binding of arrestin) [5]. Phosducin is expressed in high concentrations in retinal [6] and pineal cells [7] but has also been found in brain [8,9] and many other tissues, in smaller concentrations. A related phosducin-like protein (PHLP) is more widely expressed and is thought to play a similar role in regulating other  subunits.

The phosducin­Gt complex is found in the cytoplasm, whereas both the  [10] and  [11] subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are usually anchored to the membrane by lipid modifications to  and  subunits at the N or C termini, respectively. Of the 11  subunits identified, only two, 1 and 11, are modified with a 15-carbon farnesyl moiety at the C terminus; all other  subunits have a longer (20-carbon) geranylgeranyl modification [11]. Transducin  consists of the 1 and 1 subunits. As the  and  subunits cannot be dissociated without denaturing the protein [11], they are often referred to as a single  subunit. Here we present the structure of a complex of phosducin with Gt purified from bovine retina. This is the first structure containing a G protein  subunit in which the C-terminal isoprenyl modification on the  subunit is present. Only a brief description of the overall structure of the bovine retinal phosducin­Gt11 complex is given, because the structure is very similar to that of a recombinant rat phosducin­Gt11 complex [12]. A comparison of the phosducin­Gt11 complex with structures of isolated Gt11 [13] and the heterotrimeric complexes Gi212 [14] and Gt [15] revealed, however, that phosducin induces a conformational change in the seven-bladed  propeller of Gt, which opens up a small pocket or cavity. Electron density in this cavity appears to belong to the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of the  subunit. The formation of this cavity is not solely due to the presence of the farnesyl, because the recombinant rat phosducin­Gt11 complex [12], in which the C-terminal farnesylated sequence has been proteolytically removed, also contains the cavity. The importance of this cavity has only been revealed, however, through the structure of the present native farnesylated phosducin­Gt complex. The functional implications of a switch between an R (relaxed) and a T (tense) state in the Gt  propeller are discussed and we suggest a structural model for Gt membrane translocation. In this paper, amino-acid residues from the  subunit of transducin (Gt) are prefixed with the letter B, those from the  subunit with the letter G and those from phosducin with the letter P. The nomenclature we use to describe the seven-bladed  propeller of the  subunit follows that used by Wall et al. [14] and is different from that used by Gaudet et al. [12]. Renault et al. [16] use a similar nomenclature in describing the seven-bladed  propeller structure of RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small G protein Ran. RCC1 may be a very distant relative of the G protein  subunits.

variants of essentially the same crystal form (with cell dimensions differing by up to 12%) produced some improvement in electron-density maps. The structure of the 245 amino-acid phosducin subunit was, however, elucidated from maps that were initially quite poorly phased. The publication of the crystal structure of a complex of recombinant rat phosducin complexed with Gt11 [12] helped in interpreting the density for the phosducin subunit. When coordinates for the rat phosducin­Gt11 complex (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 2TRC) became available, we compared them with our refined structure and then performed some final rounds of refinement (see Materials and methods for details). The current model of the bovine retinal phosducin­Gt11 complex (crystal variant A -- space group P212121; a = 76.09, b = 87.91, c = 98.74 Å) consisting of some 592 amino acids, 21 waters and a farnesyl group has an R factor (R free) of 22.2% (26.1%) for data (F > 2) to 2.8 Å. The  subunit forms a seven-bladed  propeller (B45­B340) around which the  subunit is wrapped, with the N-terminal helices of the  and  subunits forming a coiled coil (Figure 1). While the overall structure of the Gt subunit in the phosducin­Gt complex is similar to that observed in isolated Gt and the heterotrimeric complexes [13­15], there are some significant structural changes in the  propeller. The phosducin subunit contains two domains, an N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal mixed  domain (Figure 1), which cover the top and one side of the Gt  propeller, respectively. Deletion-mutagenesis studies on both phosducin [17,18] and the more widely expressed rat phosducin-like protein [19] indicate that the N- and C-terminal domains can bind independently to the  subunit. The phosducin-like protein shares a sequence identity of ~41% with phosducin (see the alignment in Figure 2a) and will have a similar two-domain structure capable of associating with a  subunit in an analogous way. The C-terminal domain of phosducin (P111­P226) has a similar fold to thioredoxin, to which it is distantly related (21% sequence identity with Escherichia coli thioredoxin). Gaudet et al. [12] have previously described the relationship of the C-terminal domain with thioredoxin and have also identified a putative yeast homolog (EMBL accession number Z46727). The recent completion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome allowed us to perform a more definitive search for phosducin homologs, which identified a different protein (EMBL accession number Z75189) as the most closely related protein to phosducin in S. cerevisiae. In particular, Z75189 appears to have all three helices in the N-terminal domain as well as the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain (see Figure 2a). In the pheromone

(B60, B148 and B150 -- numbering as in Figure 2b) lining the central channel in Ste4. Whereas helix 1 packs at an angle to the  propeller, helices 2 and 3 lie on top of the  propeller and make contacts to several surface loops. One example of this is where helix 3 of phosducin packs on top of the loop connecting strands B and C of the seventh blade of the  propeller of Gt. Residues P35­P65 of phosducin are largely disordered and do not make contact with the top of the  propeller of Gt. Instead, residues in this loop make contact with a symmetry-related molecule (1/2­x,1­y,1/2+z). It seems that the flexibility in this loop is responsible for the large variations in the length of the C axis observed in different crystals (98.74­111.05 Å -- see Table 1). The conformation observed for the N-terminal domain of phosducin would be unstable in the absence of Gt. The domain lacks a proper hydrophobic core and the hydrophobic faces of amphipathic helices 2 (P74­P80) and 3 (P87­P105) are largely buried in interactions with Gt (Figure 1c). The N-terminal domain occludes the binding site for Gt on Gt (see Figure 2b). Phosphorylated phosducin still binds in vitro to transducin , with its affinity reduced about threefold in comparison to that of unphosphorylated phosducin [21,22]. The structure shows that the site of phosphorylation, Ser73, is not in contact with Gt (Figure 1). It seems likely that when not bound to Gt, the N-terminal domain of phosducin will be reorganized and that the phosphorylated form of phosducin will stabilize this alternative structure.

response of S. cerevisiae, a yeast  homolog (Ste4, see the alignment in Figure 2b) activates a kinase (Ste20) at the top of a MAP-kinase cascade [20]. Preliminary results indicate that Z75189 might regulate this pheromone response (David Stone, personal communication). The conformation observed for the N-terminal domain (P1­P110) of phosducin is stabilized by extensive interactions between the three helices in the domain and Gt (Figure 1). The loop preceding helix 1 and the N terminus of helix 1 pack against residues surrounding one end of the narrow central channel, which runs down the center of the  propeller of Gt. The yeast phosducin homolog Z75189 has an arginine residue rather than a glycine residue at position 21 (Figure 2a) and model-building studies suggest that this arginine residue will point down the narrow central channel of Ste4 to interact with acidic residues

In refining the crystal structure of the bovine retinal phosducin­Gt complex, we observed difference density, tentatively assigned to the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of the  subunit, in a cavity between blades 6 and 7 of the Gt  propeller, throughout the later stages of refinement. This cavity does not exist in the crystal structures of free Gt or Gt (or Gi), so we were initially unsure as to whether the structural change in blades 6 and 7 of the Gt  propeller was due to the farnesyl or the association of the phosducin subunit. When coordinates became available for the complex of recombinant rat phosducin with bovine retinal Gt, in which the C-terminal residues and farnesyl moiety had been removed from the  subunit by treatment with endoproteinase LysC [12], we compared them with our structure. The rat phosducin­Gt complex has a very similar structure to bovine retinal phosducin­Gt in the region of blades 6 and 7 of the Gt  propeller, indicating that the cavity formed between these blades was present in the absence of a farnesyl moiety (the overall root mean square [rms] fit for 290 Cs in the  propeller

(a) Alignment of the sequence of bovine phosducin with rat phosducin-like protein (RATPHLPA) and two phosducin-like proteins from yeast (EMBL accession codes: Z75189 and Z46727). Modeling studies (unpublished data) suggest that Z75189 is more likely to be the yeast phosducin homolog. Also shown is a structurally based alignment with thioredoxin (THIO_E). Highlighted in blue are phosducin residues that contact Gt. Residues not in bold type have poor electron density in phosducin (and may be quite mobile parts of the structure), or are regions in the rat phosducin-like protein and the two yeast phosducin-like proteins that are likely to have a different structure to that observed in phosducin. Helices are represented by green cylinders and  sheets are represented by green arrows. (b) Sequence alignment of the  subunit of transducin (Bov. 1) with the G protein  subunit from S. cerevisiae (Ste4); the conformations of the large inserts at the N terminus of Ste4 and between blades 5 and 6 (around position 270) are uncertain (letters not in bold type). The alignment shows the seven WD40 repeats in the sequence (residues 45­340); the seven blades of the  propeller are indicated underneath with continuous lines for blades 1­6 and a broken line for blade 7 (residues 45­52 and 314­340). Residues that contact phosducin (within 3.8 Å) are highlighted in blue and those that contact the  subunit in the heterotrimeric G protein (PDB code 1GP2; Wall et al. [14]) are indicated in red. Residues which make contact with both the  subunit and phosducin are highlighted in magenta (note no residues from Gt make contacts with phosducin).

The refinement was carried out with the program X-PLOR [33], and included a bulk solvent correction as well as conventional positional refinement. Note that in (b) the waters have moved very little from their starting positions and make good hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues.

the  subunit (Glu G66, Leu G67, Lys G68, Gly G69, Gly G70, and Cys G71), the possibility that the electron density observed in the cavity between strands 6 and 7 of the Gt  propeller is due to some other chemical entity cannot be ruled out. In our model, the farnesyl is not entirely buried -- the distal end is in a cavity, but much of the farnesyl lies in a groove packing between the sidechains of Phe B333 and Lys B335 on strand C of blade 7 (Figure 3). Approximately 80% of the accessible surface of the farnesyl is buried. Although the farnesyl is not in a notably hydrophobic environment, hydrophilic sidechain functions of residues within van der Waals distance of the farnesyl are satisfied (e.g. Asp B333 and Thr B329 make hydrogen bonds with Arg B314 and the amide group of Phe B335 and Trp B339). Residues surrounding the farnesyl have good density and temperature factors typical of well-ordered parts of the structure. The farnesyl-binding pocket in transducin  does not seem very similar to the isoprenyl-binding pockets in the structures of Rho GDI [23,24] or Rab GDI [25] although, curiously, the pockets in both transducin  and Rho GDI contain acidic residues. A comparison of the  subunit in the crystal structures of isolated Gt, Gt and Gi suggests that although there is some flexibility in the position of the N-terminal helices relative to the  propeller and in the conformation of the loop connecting strand C with strand D in blade 2 (around residue B130), the seven-bladed  propeller is a rather rigid structure (Figure 4). The binding of phosducin has, however, produced a distinct change in the conformation of the  propeller in the region of blade 7. We suggest that in the phosducin complex, the  subunit is in a T state, while the other conformation observed for the  propeller (in the structures of free  or  in complex with the  subunit) represents the R state. In the phosducin­Gt complex, the DA loop that connects the D strand of blade 6 with the A strand of blade 7 has a radically different conformation from that observed in the crystal structures of isolated Gt [13] and of the Gt­GDP­ complex [15] (Figures 4 and 5). In the structures of isolated Gt and heterotrimeric Gt (and Gi212 [14]) the imidazole group of His B311 packs between the sidechains of Thr B329 and Asp B333 (Figure 5), stabilizing the DA loop in a conformation adopted by most of the DA loops in the seven WD40 repeats [13,14]. In the phosducin­Gt complex, the sidechain of His B311 has flipped out and moved ~12 Å (Figure 5) to interact with Glu P196. The new conformation of the DA loop is stabilized by different interactions; the mainchain carboxyl of Asn B313 makes a hydrogen bond with the sidechain NE1 atom of Trp B332, and the sidechain of Arg B314 has moved ~15 Å to interact with Asp B333.

The whole of blade 7 of the Gt  propeller has been rotated in the complex with phosducin (Figure 4) and smaller movements have occurred in blades 6 and 1. The motion of the blades has resulted in substantial movements of some residues in the BC and DA loops on the `upper' surface of the propeller, such as Trp B332 and Trp B99. The sidechain of Trp B332 has moved ~8 Å from its position in the isolated Gt [13], while the C of Trp B332 has moved ~2.5 Å (the position of Trp B332 in isolated Gt and in Gt or Gi is very similar [13­15]).

subunit (Figures 1 and 2b), whereas the C-terminal domain packs against the side of the Gt propeller, contacting residues that are not involved in the interaction with Gt (namely B42, B44­B47, B268, B304 and B309­B312; Figure 2b). Therefore peptides from the C-terminal domains of phosducin and the phosducin-like protein [18,19], which antagonize G-stimulated GTPase activity on Go, presumably do so indirectly by inducing a conformational change in G. We suggest that these peptides convert the Gt subunit from the R to the T state, thereby altering the upper surface (including Trp B99) of the  propeller. In modeling studies where the Gt subunit in the heterotrimeric complex Gt­GDP­ was replaced by the Gt subunit from the phosducin­Gt complex, the binding of the  subunit in its T state to the  subunit causes a small steric clash between Trp B99 on the  subunit and the mainchain carbonyl of Cys A210 from the  subunit (Figure 6). Thus, switching to a T conformation

protein transducin . Subsequently, the G protein is released from the membrane and the GTP-bound  subunit dissociates from the  subunit to activate the effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase. After the  subunit bound GTP is hydrolyzed, the  subunit reassociates and the heterotrimeric Gt­GDP­ complex rebinds to the membrane for receptor interaction and turnover of the signal-transduction cascade. In contrast to the heterotrimeric G protein transducin Gt­GDP­, which is membrane associated, the complex of phosducin with the  subunit of transducin is soluble and is present in the cytosol of the photoreceptor cell. The binding of phosducin to the  subunit of activated transducin shuts down the signal because it blocks the reassociation with the  subunit that is required for membrane association and the turnover of the signal-transduction cascade. The current structure of the native farnesylated phosducin­Gt complex clearly indicates that binding of phosducin to Gt induces a structural change in the  subunit, leading to the formation of a farnesylbinding cavity within the  subunit. This farnesyl-binding cavity is present only in the complex of phosducin with transducin  and is not present in the complex of  transducin with the  subunit or in the crystal structure of the free  subunit. On the basis of these structural findings, we propose a new model for the attenuation of the visual signal-transduction cascade by phosducin.  subunits of G proteins can exist in two different conformations that we term R and T. In the R conformation occurring in the structures of Gt­GDP­ or of the free  subunit, the farnesyl moiety of the  subunit is exposed leading to membrane association of the complex. In the T conformation occurring in the  subunit bound to unphosphorylated phosducin, by contrast, the farnesyl moiety is effectively buried inside a cavity formed in the  subunit, which presumably favors cytosolic localization. The binding of unphosphorylated phosducin to transducin  switches the  subunit from the R conformation (exposed farnesyl) to the T conformation (buried farnesyl), sequesters the  subunit from the membrane to the cytosol and attenuates the signal-transduction cascade. Phosphorylation of phosducin on Ser73 reduces its affinity for the  subunit. The released  subunit then switches back to the R conformation to reassociate with the  subunit and rebind to the membrane, where it is required for the turnover of the signal-transduction cascade. The regulation of this membrane-association/dissociation switch by phosducin may have general implications for G protein coupled signaltransduction cascades.

A peptide corresponding to residues P215­P232 of phosducin (green) can inhibit -stimulated GTPase activity on the  subunit, presumably by effecting a conformational change of the  subunit [18]. The  subunit (blue) is shown in the T state (the state stabilized by rhodopsin). Trp B99 has moved in comparison to its position in the Gt­GDP­ structure (red), causing a steric clash with Cys A210 in the switch II region of the  subunit (yellow). Apart from Trp B99, most other residues on the  subunit that interact with the  subunit have similar positions in the T and R states of .

in the  subunit would induce a structural change in the  subunit, offering a plausible structural explanation as to why such phosducin-derived peptides can antagonize Gstimulated GTPase activity on Go [18]. Interestingly, the view of Gt­GDP­ in Figure 6 is similar to that seen by the receptor rhodopsin [1]; rhodopsin interacts with not only the  subunit but also the C-terminal regions of both the  and  subunits. Whether activated rhodopsin induces an R to T structural change in the  subunit is not known; if rhodopsin does induce such a change it will affect the ­ interface and could promote the stability of a nucleotide-free Gt­Mg2+­ conformation [26] prior to the binding of GTP.
A structural model for the regulation of the visual signaltransduction cascade by phosducin

Membrane association of heterotrimeric G proteins is required for receptor interaction and initiation of the signal-transduction cascade. This membrane association is mediated by two post-translational modifications. Firstly, the N-terminal myristoylation of the  subunit and secondly, the C-terminal farnesyl or geranyl geranylation of the G-protein  subunit. One of the best studied examples of such a system is the visual signal-transduction cascade. Light activation of the receptor molecule rhodopsin triggers the nucleotide exchange of the heterotrimeric G

receptor molecules in response to a wide variety of extracellular signals. A particularly well-studied system is that in which the absorption of a photon by the receptor rhodopsin activates the hetrotrimeric G protein transducin Gt. The structure of the bovine retinal phosducin­Gt complex shows that  subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins can adopt two alternative conformations that we term R and T. In one conformation (R), observed for the isolated Gt subunits and the heterotrimeric complexes, the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of the  subunit is exposed and this conformation presumably favors membrane localization. In the other conformation (T), the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of the  subunit is apparently buried in a cavity in the  subunit and this favors the  subunit being in the cytoplasm. This cavity represents a potential target for rational drug design. Binding of phosducin switches the  subunit from the R (membrane-associated) conformation to the T (cytosolic) conformation, thereby attenuating the signal-transduction cascade. Phosphorylation of phosducin at Ser73 reduces its affinity for the  subunit. The released  subunit switches back to the R conformation to rebind with the  subunit and associate with the membrane. Mediation of this membrane-association/dissociation switch of Gt by phosducin may be a general mechanism for the regulation of G protein coupled signal-transduction.

Crystals grew within a week to a size of approximately 350 × 150 × 150 µm. Four native datasets collected from crystals of the phosducin­Gt complex were used in the structure determination (Table 1). One dataset to 3.5 Å was collected at room temperature, using a Mar imaging plate on eight crystals at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), Daresbury. Three more datasets, extending to between 2.8 Å and 3.0 Å, were collected from single frozen crystals on a chargecoupled device (CCD) on beamline D2AM at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), Grenoble (see Table 1). Crystals belong to the spacegroup P212121 with one heterotrimer per asymmetric unit. Datasets A­C were processed with the program XDS [30]; dataset D was processed with the program Denzo [31]. Henceforth we refer to the four datasets A­D, as coming from four different crystal forms A­D (note: these `different'crystal forms are closely related and could equally well be referred to as variants of the same crystal form. We refer to them as different crystal forms for the sake of convenience). The positions of the transducin  subunits of crystal forms A and B were determined by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the 12 subunits from the crystal structure of Gi212 [14]. The rotation and translation functions, which were solved with Amore [32], gave clear solutions (Table 2) and confirmed that the spacegroup was P212121 (translation functions in related spacegroups did not yield solutions). The positions of the refined solutions in crystal forms A and B are related by a rotation of ~1.4° with a translation of ~0.5 Å (along the rotation axis). The molecular replacement solutions for the  subunits were refined in the program X-PLOR [33] to give R factors (R frees) of 48.2% (53.5%) and 46.8% (49.3%) on datasets A and B, respectively. The refinement procedure consisted of rigid body and group temperature factor refinement, and a bulk solvent correction was included (atomic positions were not refined until cycle 8 of the refinement procedure when most of the model had been built; see Table 3). SIGMAA weighted [34] 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc maps were calculated with all data from 20.0­3.1 Å and examined with O [35].

Molecular replacement and preliminary refinement

Materials and methods

Phosducin­Gt was isolated at 4°C from frozen bovine retina, using a modification of existing protocols [27]. The purification protocol involved four chromatographic steps, the first two of which were also used for the purification of bovine retinal creatine kinase and have been described in detail elsewhere [28]. After elution from the second, hydroxyapatite column, fractions containing phosducin were identified by phosphorylation in the presence of protein kinase A and [-32P]ATP analyzed by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE). The combined fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 2 × 5 l of buffer A (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM sodium benzamidine). The pooled fractions were applied to a Fractogel EMD-DEAE 650 (S) column (EM-Separations, 2.6 × 15 cm,) pre-equilibrated in buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient (600 ml), from 0­300 mM NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing phosducin (the major peak around 200 mM NaCl) were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 5 l of buffer A. Finally, the phosducin was applied to a Bioscale Q2 column (Biorad) and eluted with a linear gradient (60 ml) from 50 mM­300 mM NaCl in buffer A. The peak fraction was collected, concentrated to about 10 mg/ml and then used in crystallization trials. The composition of the crystals was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing and phosphorylation in the presence of protein kinase C and [-32P]ATP. We have attempted to measure mass spectra on protein purified from crystals but to date, without success.

contained 377 amino acid residues, 57.6% of the total number of residues in the complex, and as expected, the quality of the maps phased on the molecular replacement solution was poor.

Cross-crystal averaging
Analysis of the initial maps phased by the molecular replacement solutions allowed a putative phosducin domain to be located. The electron density in this region appeared slightly higher and had better connectivity. The transformation matrix from crystal form A to crystal form B for the density for the phosducin domain (ABP) was virtually identical to the transformation matrix for an adjacent  subunit (AB). A mask was made around the phosducin domain and the  subunit (Figure 7) with the program MAMA [36]. Ten cycles of cross-crystal averaging with the program MAVE [36] increased the correlation coefficient from 0.517 to 0.690. The averaged map between crystal forms A and B was of better quality than the unaveraged maps and was largely used for an initial rebuild of the  and  subunits. At this stage dataset C was collected and, as no heavy atom derivative had yet been found, we decided to extend the averaging over the four best datasets collected (Datasets A­D, Table 1). Crystal forms C and D were solved by molecular replacement using the rebuilt  and  subunits and a cross-crystal averaging was run between Table 3 Progress of structure refinement.

the four closely related crystal forms. Cross-crystal averaging was run after each of the first eight refinement cycles (Table 3), and as more of the structure became defined, particularly the N-terminal phosducin domain, the mask was iteratively modified. The structure was largely rebuilt into averaged maps or maps phased on the last averaging cycle.

Refinement
All refinement was carried out with X-PLOR [33]. Alternating with cycles of refinement were manual rebuilds on the graphics with the program O [35]. In the first seven refinement cycles (Table 3) individual positional atomic parameters were not refined; the only positional refinement in these first seven cycles was rigid body refinement and the model was broken up into as many as 13 pieces. Typically, the  propeller of the  subunit and much of the  subunit was treated as a single rigid body, but the N-terminal helices of the  and  subunits were treated as a separate rigid body and the phosducin was often broken into several pieces corresponding to secondary structural elements. After six rounds of refinement, much of the secondary structure of the phosducin had been revealed and it was at this stage that the structure of recombinant rat phosducin complexed with bovine transducin  was published [12]. This confirmed that the averaging procedure

(a,c,e,g) Improvement in electron density on some of the central  strands of the C-terminal domain of phosducin. Panel (a) shows part of an electrondensity map centered on the C-terminal phosducin domain using the phase information based on the initial molecular replacement solution shown in (b) (Gt in green and Gt in red). Using the bones option in the program MAMA [36], a mask was generated around the putative phosducin domain and the  propeller of Gt. (d) The generated mask is shown in blue and the bones within the putative phosducin domain in yellow, together with the initial model of Gt (green and red). Crosscrystal averaging in the program MAVE [36] was performed, resulting in an improved map (c). After six rounds of refinement, cross-crystal averaging and rebuilding, most of the phosducin­Gt complex had been revealed and amino-acid assignments could be made. The improved electron-density map in the C-terminal domain of phosducin (e) is shown together with the corresponding model of phosducin (yellow) and Gt and Gt (green and red) in (f).

was working well and that several of the initial assignments made were correct. It also helped in the iterative expansion of the mask, particularly on the N-terminal domain where one of the helices (P74­P80) had not been revealed.

and B after 11 rounds of refinement were 22.4% (28.5%) and 22.1% (26.9%), respectively. At this stage, when the refinement was essentially complete, the coordinates of the complex of recombinant rat phosducin with Gt [12] became available. Comparison of the structure refined in crystal form A with that of Gaudet et al. [12] showed the structures to be very similar (rms fit = 0.641 Å for 564 C atoms), although rigid body movements of the N-terminal helices of Gt and Gt had occurred and there were quite large deviations in C positions in `flexible' regions of the phosducin N-terminal domain. The rms fit for 290 C atoms in the  propeller was 0.363 Å (residues B45­B128 and B135­B340), showing that the  propellers had very similar conformations in our structure and in that determined by Gaudet et al. [12] -- the conformations of residues B300­B340 were virtually identical. This confirmed that the structural change in blades 6 and 7 was due to the binding of phosducin and not due to the presence of the farnesyl that we had tentatively assigned to density in the pocket between these blades. In round 12 of the refinement we refined both our current structure and the coordinates of Gaudet et al. [12] (selenomethionines were first mutated to methionine and residues B4­B340, G3­G65, P16­P36, P69­P228 were refined, first with rigid body, then positional refinement; see Table 3). Comparison of maps calculated from both sets of coordinates tended to show that where the structures differed substantially (surface loops, and N-termini of Gt and Gt) our refined structure was better, but for much of the structure the two sets of coordinates were virtually identical (apart from a few sequence differences between rat and bovine phosducin). The Fo­Fc map calculated from the refined Gaudet et al. [12] coordinates confirmed the presence of difference density in the cavity between blades 6 and 7. After a complete rebuild, three sets of coordinates were refined with (a) a farnesyl, (b) the water structure of Gaudet et al. [12] and (c) a single water molecule in the cavity. Maps calculated from all three refinements showed density for the farnesyl; see Figure 3 for maps from (a) and (b). The final model after 15 rounds of refinement contains 592 amino acids, 21 water molecules and a farnesyl group and has an R factor (R free) of 22.2% (26.1%) on data between 20.0­2.8 Å (this includes a bulk solvent correction). The N terminus of the  chain is blocked and starts with an N-terminal acetyl group (ACE B1). The density is consistent with the N-terminal methionine having been removed prior to acetylation, as would be expected from N-terminal processing rules [37] and as shown for transducin 1 [38]. All other residues are present in the  chain, although there is poor density for residues B128­B134. Aminoacid sequencing indicated that the N terminal residue of the  subunit is a proline (Pro G2) and this is the first residue in our structure for the  chain; residues G2­G66 are present but density for G66 is poor and there is only weak density for G67­G71, which are not included. The N terminus (P1­P12), one large loop (P38­P67) and the C terminus (P231­P245) have poor density and are not included in our model.
