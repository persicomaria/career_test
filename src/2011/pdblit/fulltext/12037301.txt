The three-dimensional structure of calcium-depleted human C-reactive protein from perfectly twinned crystals
C-reactive protein is a member of the pentraxin family of oligomeric serum proteins which has been conserved through evolution, homologues having been found in every species in which they have been sought. Human C-reactive protein (hCRP) is the classical acute-phase reactant produced in large amounts in response to tissue damage and in¯ammation and is used almost universally as a clinical indicator of infection and in¯ammation. The role of hCRP in host defence and the calcium-dependent ligand-binding speci®city of hCRP for phosphocholine moieties have long been recognized. In order to clarify the structural rearrangements associated with calcium binding, the reported af®nity of calcium-depleted hCRP for polycations and other ligands, and the role of calcium in protection against denaturation and proteolysis, the structure of calcium-depleted hCRP has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Crystals of calcium-depleted hCRP are invariably twinned and those suitable for analysis are merohedral type II twins of point group 4 single crystals. The structure has been solved by molecular replacement using the calcium-bound hCRP structure [Shrive et al. (1996), Nature Struct. Biol. 3, 346±354]. It reveals two independent pentamers which form a face-to-face decamer across a dyad near-parallel to the twinning twofold axis. Cycles of intensity deconvolution, density modi®cation (tenfold NCS) and model building, eventually including re®nement, give a ®nal R factor of 0.19 (Rfree = 0.20). Despite poor de®nition in some areas arising from the limited resolution of the data and from the twinning and disorder, the structure reveals the probable mode of twinning and the conformational changes, localized in one of the calcium-binding loops, which accompany calcium binding.

1. Introduction
C-reactive protein (CRP; Volanakis, 2001) is a member of the pentraxin family of oligomeric calcium-binding proteins. Homologues of CRP have been found in creatures as diverse as the phylogenetically ancient horseshoe crab and man (see, for example, Pepys et al., 1978; Robey & Liu, 1981; Gewurz et al., 1995; Jensen et al., 1997; Lund & Olafsen, 1998; Shrive et al., 1999). Human C-reactive protein (hCRP), a disc-like molecule consisting of ®ve identical protomers of 206 amino acids arranged in a cyclic pentameric aggregation (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996), is the classical acute-phase reactant produced in large amounts in response to tissue damage and in¯ammation and is used almost universally as a clinical indicator of infection and in¯ammation (Pepys & Berger, 2001). CRP's major physiological ligand, recognized in a calcium-dependent manner, is the phosphocholine (PC) head group exposed on damaged cells or foreign pathogens such as

pneumococcal C-polysaccharide (PnC; Volanakis & Kaplan, 1971). Following binding to PnC, but not to simple PC itself, hCRP binds C1q and ef®ciently activates complement (Volanakis, 1982). Although the primary biological function of CRP remains controversial, its functional activities and conservation suggest an important role in innate host defence. Circular dichroism (Young & Williams, 1978; Mullenix & Mortensen, 1994), immunochemical (Kilpatrick et al., 1982; Swanson et al., 1991), infrared spectroscopy (Dong et al., 1994) and other experiments (Heaton et al., 1999) have suggested varying levels of hCRP conformational and/or allosteric change accompanying removal or binding of calcium. Since bound Ca2+ is required for PC binding, the calcium-induced conformational changes are generally reported to be essential for formation of the proper conformation of the phosphocholine-binding site (Kilpatrick et al., 1982). Studies on the binding reactivity of hCRP for polycations (DiCamelli et al., 1980; Potempa et al., 1981; Dougherty et al., 1982) show that polycation binding by both hCRP and rabbit CRP is inhibited by calcium, this inhibition being reversed by PC bound in the presence of calcium. These results have been interpreted in terms of proximal but distinct PC and polycation-binding sites, with calcium and polycations competing for the same site (Potempa et al., 1981). In addition to effecting the binding of physiological ligands, the calcium ions in hCRP also perform a role in maintaining the integrity of the protein. In the presence of calcium ions hCRP resists denaturation induced by high temperatures (Heaton et al., 1999) and by high concentrations of urea (Potempa et al., 1983). The binding of calcium to CRP may also serve to protect CRP from proteolytic degradation or denaturation in the blood during the acute phase of infection. In the absence of calcium, hCRP is cleaved between Asn145 and Phe146 by Nagarse protease, and between Phe146 and Glu147 by Pronase; this cleavage results in disruption of the two high-af®nity calcium-binding sites (Kinoshita et al., 1989). This cleavage is completely inhibited in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2. In the native calcium-bound hCRP structure (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996) the protomers contain two calcium ions, both with a chelation of ®ve. Each of the two independent pentamers within the crystal asymmetric unit contained a single protomer which forms a crystal contact with the calcium-binding site of a protomer from another pentamer, resulting in the loss of calcium within that protomer. Several changes in loops around the surface of the protomer, arising either from loss of calcium or from the crystal contacts were observed compared with the calcium-bound protomers. The two calcium ions per protomer form the binding site for the phosphate moiety of physiological ligands, including phosphocholine (PC). The structure of the hCRP±PC complex (Thompson et al., 1999) shows that binding of simple PC produces no structural or conformational changes in either the protomer or the pentameric aggregate, leaving the hCRP structure (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996) essentially unchanged. In order to clarify both the hCRP molecular conformational changes which accompany calcium binding

and the af®nity of calcium-depleted hCRP for polycations, the structure of calcium-depleted human CRP has been determined by X-ray crystallography.

2. Methods
2.1. Data collection and twinning

Human CRP was isolated from serum (Volanakis et al., 1978) and crystallized according to DeLucas et al. (1987). Two tetragonal crystal forms (forms I and II) were grown in the absence of calcium, both with apparent point group 422. Datacollection and processing statistics have been reported previously (Myles et al., 1990). Systematic absences and diffraction symmetry clearly suggest space group P4122 or P4322 for the form I crystals (unit-cell parameters a = 102, Ê c = 309 A) and space group P4222 for the form II crystals Ê (unit-cell parameters a = 103, c = 308 A), with both crystal forms containing one pentamer within the asymmetric unit and 66% solvent (Myles et al., 1990). Although the Rsym values clearly indicate point group 422 in both cases and no indication of twinning was detected by standard light microscopy, subsequent analysis has now shown both sets of data to be twinned (Holden, 1995). In the case of the form I crystals the apparently perfect 422 symmetry and the 41 absence indicate perfectly hemihedrally twinned crystals (twinning fraction  = 0.5; Yeates, 1997) arising from P41 or P43 crystals twinned by 180 rotation about either [100] or [110]. These single crystals will thus contain two independent pentamers in the asymmetric unit. It is of interest to note that the intensity statistics [N(Z) test] suggest a twinning fraction  = 0.25 (Holden, 1995). Model twins (Holden, 1995), the intensity statistics distribution function (Rees, 1980) and the structure solution, however, con®rm  = 0.5 and the smoothing in¯uence of high non-crystallographic symmetry on the intensity statistics, particularly for lower order re¯ections, leading to a reduction in the apparent  (Holden, 1995; Rees, 1980). The form II crystals have been shown to be pseudomerohedrally twinned (Holden, 1995) arising from C2221 single crystals with unit-cell parameters a = 146, b = 145, Ê c = 308 A and a twinning fraction  = 0.5. In this case, a twofold rotation about the C2221 [110] (equivalent to 90 about [001]) produces pseudo-tetragonal P4222 crystals with Ê apparent axes a = 103, c = 308 A. Since a 9 b in the C2221 lattice, small deviations from perfect overlap of the twinrelated lattices are apparent in the diffraction pattern only at higher resolution. Single crystals of this calcium-free human CRP C2221 crystal form (form III) have been obtained, but unresolved pseudosymmetry has so far prevented determination of the structure (Shrive, Holden et al., 1996).
2.2. Structure determination

The calcium-free structure was determined from the form I crystals by molecular replacement using the calcium-bound structure of human CRP (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996) and programs from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational È Project, Number 4, 1994) and X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). The

diffraction data were collected on ®lm in 1989 and the only data now available are those merged in 422. The self-rotation function calculated in P422 gave a single ®vefold direction (Yeates, 1997) at 9 = 45, = 57, = 72 (Myles et al., 1990). As the pentamers in the calcium-bound structure contained one protomer in each pentamer which contained no calcium and differed slightly in conformation to the other protomers, a model pentamer consisting of ®ve identical calcium-bound protomers was used for molecular-replacement studies. The pentamer was aligned with the pentameric ®vefold along tetragonal c. Cross rotation functions (ALMN) using the twinned data in 422 gave a single outstanding solution (rotation R1) at  = 45,  = 57,  = 64 which corresponds to the expected ®vefold direction from self-rotation functions. As expected, cross rotation-function studies on the twinned data expanded to P4 symmetry gave the two ®vefold directions R1 at  = 45,  = 57,  = 64 and R2 at  = 45,  = 123,  = 28 , which are twofold-symmetry related in 422 about [110] when the equivalents of R1 at  = 135,  = À57,  = À116 and of R2 at  = 135,  = 123,  = 28 are used. Translation-function searches were carried out on the twinned data expanded to P4 symmetry. The rotation-function solution R1 gave two outstanding translations (heights 24 r.m.s.; TFFC) in P43: T11 at x = 0.204, y = 0.970, z = 0.0 and T12 at x = 0.243, y = 0.928, z = 0.0. Solutions in P41 were at a signi®cantly lower level (10 r.m.s.). The twofold-related orientation R2, an independent rotation in P4 and part of the crystal symmetry in point group 422, gave the two expected outstanding solutions, which were related to T11 and T12 by the twinning twofold parallel to [110], in P43: T21 at x = 0.928, y = 0.243, z = 0.0 and T22 at x = 0.971, y = 0.204, z = 0.0. Inputting solution R1T11 gave the translation for R2 as T21 = 0.429, 0.743, 0.068 (at 50 r.m.s.) and inputting R1T12 gave the translation for R2 as T22 = 0.469, 0.704, 0.068 (at 49 r.m.s.) and vice versa. This therefore gives two pairs of solutions, the pair R1T11, R2T21 and its twin-related pair R2T22, R1T12, related by the twinning twofold which generates 422 symmetry through interaction with the tetragonal fourfold. We therefore have two solutions, designated Single and Twin, one from each of the two twin-related portions of the crystal. Since R1 and R2 are twofold related about the twinning twofold in the crystal, each of the twin-related portions also contains a twofold, relating R1T11 and R2T21 for the Single portion and necessarily de®ned as parallel to [110] at this stage, but in this case it occurs as twofold NCS. Packing diagrams revealed that the two independent pentamers in P43 were assembled to form decamers with 52 NCS symmetry, one of the decameric NCS twofolds being that parallel to [110] and hence the twinning twofold (see x3). While the solutions chosen de®ne the twinning twofold as parallel to [110], choice of other symmetry-equivalent rotations would have provided an equally valid twinning twofold parallel to [110]. The ®t of the starting model to the observed twinned data Iobs, expanded to P43, was investigated by scaling Iobs to the combined calculated P43 intensities for the solution (structure factor |Fc|Single) and its twin (structure factor |Fc|Twin). |Fc|Single was calculated from the solution pair R1T11 (protomers A, B, C, D, E) and R2T21 (protomers F, G, H, I, J), and the twin-related structure factor |Fc|Twin was calculated by reindexing of |Fc|Single by hkl A khl (equivalent to a twofold rotation about [110]). Conversion to intensities and placement in the P43 asymmetric unit was followed by calculation of IcSingle+Twin = IcSingle + (1 À )IcTwin and scaling to the observed twinned data I  scaling R factor RsSingle+Twin = obs. A  |Fc|Single+Twin À |Fobs|a |Fobs| (SCALEIT) of 0.335 for  = 0.5 was obtained. The merging of the observed data in 422 imposes a minimum value of RsSingle+Twin at  = 0.5. Following an initial rigid-body re®nement (X-PLOR) of the Single solution R1T11, R2T21 (calculated structure factor |Fc|Single) against the twinned observed data |Fobs| expanded to P43, the scaling R factor RsSingle+Twin was reduced to 0.259.  rigid-body re®nement itself gave an R factor The  |Fc|Single À |Fobs|a |Fobs|) of 0.348 from the initial (R = Ê value of 0.387, using all data in the resolution range 20±3.15 A. The ®nal rotations and translations of the re®ned rigid-body model relative to the starting model were  = 134.8,  = À58.0,  = À115.6 ; x = 0.204, y = 0.971, z = 0.000 for R1T11 and  = 134.3,  = 122.3,  = 28.5 ; x = 0.430, y = 0.743, z = 0.068 for R2T21. The re®ned values of R1 and R2 suggest that the NCS twofold relating R1T11 and R2T21 deviates slightly from parallel to [110].
2.3. Model building and refinement

The general procedure now followed throughout the structure solution and re®nement was as follows: the Single solution pair R1T11, R2T21 in P43 was used as the model for building and for the subsequent generation of FcSingle (SFALL) and hence IcSingle and, by reindexing (REINDEX), the twin-related intensity IcTwin. |Fo|Single was then calculated according to Redinbo & Yeates (1993), jFo jSingle  IoSingle 1a2  Iobs  IcSingle À IcTwin a21a2 X Each cycle of model building (2|Fo|Single À |Fc|Single maps in O) was followed by recalculation of |Fc|Single, 9cSingle and |Fo|Single (SFALL, SIGMAA), followed by density modi®cation, tenfold NCS averaging (DM) and calculation of a new Fourier map (FFT). The progress of the structural re®nement and of the detwinning procedure for |Fo|Single was monitored Ê by scaling of |Fc|Single to |Fo|Single (RSTATS; 20±3.15 A data) and calculation of  scaling R factor RsSingle = the   |Fc|Single À |Fo|Single|a |Fo|Single. The initial value of RsSingle was 0.223. Prior to the ®rst cycle of model building, 2|Fo|Single À |Fc|Single Fourier maps with various regions of the structure (including the pentraxin helix) omitted from FcSingle and from the NCS protein mask in DM clearly showed the omitted regions, con®rming the initial quality and independence of the maps. These maps also showed signi®cant structural change in the calcium-binding loop 138±150 and various conformations of this loop, where visible, in different protomers. The conformation of residues 57 and 58 was also seen to vary between the protomers owing to contacts with the 138±150 loop; the appropriate residues in the appropriate protomers were subsequently omitted from all averaging procedures.

Additional residues not conforming to the NCS were removed from averaging as the structure re®nement progressed. Following four cycles of model building, recalculation of |Fo|Single, NCS averaging and density modi®cation, the scaling R factor RsSingle was reduced to 0.219 for all data in the Ê resolution range 20±3.15 A. A rigid-body re®nement (X-PLOR) of the resulting `Single' model (calculated structure factor |Fc|Single) against |Fo|Single reduced the scaling R factor RsSingle to 0.215.  rigid-body re®nement itself gave an The    R factor (R = |Fc|Single À |Fo|Singlea |Fo|Single) of Ê 0.224 using all data in the resolution range 20±3.15 A. The free R factor was not used up to this point and indeed it is open to some debate as to whether such a quantity is truly meaningful when both |Fobs| and Fcalc are altered at each stage of structure solution and re®nement. Nevertheless, since the free R will provide an independent check for a given set of |Fobs| during a multiple-cycle re®nement pass, a free R set (5% of the re¯ections) was generated prior to X-PLOR re®nement and was maintained throughout the remainder of the re®nement. Cycles of calculation of |Fo|Single, X-PLOR positional re®nement using tenfold NCS restraints where appropriate, recalculation of |Fo|Single, density modi®cation, symmetry averaging, map calculation and model building were carried out. This  procedure reduced the R factor in X-PLOR |Fc|Single À |Fo|Singlea |Fo|Single) from an initial (RXplor = value of 0.224 (RXplor free = 0.223) to 0.219 (0.219), respectively. The value of RsSingle at this stage was 0.218. The X-PLOR component of the structure re®nement was extended to include cycles of overall B-factor re®nement (which Ê converged to B = 20.8 A2) followed by individual B-factor re®nement. NCS restraints were applied throughout as appropriate. The ®nal R factors were RsSingle = 0.188, RXplor = 0.186 and RXplor free = 0.199 for all data between 20 and Ê 3.15 A. All main-chain and side-chain stereochemical parameters fall either inside or are better than those expected from Ê a structure at 3.15 A resolution (PROCHECK; Laskowski et al., 1993), with 77% of the residues in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot and 23% in additional allowed regions. There are four residues in generously allowed regions and none in disallowed regions. It has not been

possible to alleviate a small number of relatively short bad contacts, mainly involving residues either directly or indirectly involved in crystal packing and twinning (see x4). which immediately follows the pentraxin helix and shows local conformational changes with respect to the native calciumbound structure (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996). The contact residues are Thr173 in P1 and Pro179 in P2 and vice versa, the decamer thus being stabilized by ®ve relatively small surface contacts between the two pentamers. The decameric NCS twofold near-perpendicular to z in the layer of pentamers at z = 0 (Fig. 3) is near-parallel to [110] and approximately bisects the a and b axes (see below) and relates protomer pairs AI, BJ, CF, DG and EH. This NCS twofold is thus near-parallel to the twinning twofold axis parallel to [110] (see x4). Signi®cant deviations (at this resolution) from the NCS are seen only in regions involved in and proximal to the contact interfaces both between and within the z layers of decamers. A least-squares ®t of the two pentamers across the NCS twofold, based on C atoms and excluding contact Ê regions, gives an r.m.s. deviation of 0.3 A and direction cosines of the NCS twofold corresponding to 45.3 from a, 44.7 from b and 89.4 from c. The NCS twofold is thus 0.6 from [110]. The major signi®cant conformational change between the calcium-depleted and the calcium-bound protomer structure (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996) is shown by the calciumbinding loop 138±150 (L1). Substantial parts of this loop are disordered and mobile except in protomers B, F, G and J (see Fig. 4), where it makes a crystal contact within a z layer (the decamers related by unit-cell translations perpendicular to z)

3. Results
3.1. Overall structure

Ê The 3.15 A structure reveals the pentraxin fold (Fig. 1) and two independent pentamers, P1 composed of protomers A, B, C, D, E and P2 composed of protomers F, G, H, I, J, which form a face-to-face (pentraxin helix to pentraxin helix) NCS 52 point-group symmetry decamer with the two pentameric ®vefold axes coincident (Fig. 2). The relative rotation between P1 and P2, as de®ned by the difference between the centres of mass of the subunits in the two pentamers, is approximately 20 and the calcium-binding regions are situated on the two external pentameric faces of the decamer. The ®vefold approximately symmetrical (at this resolution) contact between the two pentamers in the decamer is made by the pentraxin helix (169±176) and the `jug-handle' loop 177±182

4. Discussion
4.1. Conformational changes and calcium binding

The loss or addition of calcium does not induce signi®cant allosteric or conformational changes either in the pentameric aggregation or the protomer except in the mobile calcium-binding loop L1. This 138± 150 loop contains glycine residues at 143 and 144, as do all known pentraxin sequences, and a third glycine at residue 148 which, of the sequenced vertebrate pentraxins, is unique to human CRP. Although the calcium-binding loop L1 adopts variable conformations in the crystal structure, with the reasonably well de®ned examples in protomers B, F, G and J (see Fig. 4) arising from crystal contacts, it is more likely that this loop is generally mobile, as in the

1991) and infrared spectroscopy (Dong et al., 1994) experiments have been interpreted in terms of large conformational and/or allosteric changes upon removal or binding of calcium. The structural results presented here show only mobility in the calcium-binding loop L1, while the spectroscopic results, for example, have been interpreted as indicating signi®cant increases in both -sheet and helical content on calcium binding (Dong et al., 1994). Disorder in the calcium-binding loop 138±150 has been observed in other pentraxin protomers which lack calcium (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996), but the results presented here show that the associated conformational changes observed in other loop regions in the calciumdepleted protomer of our previously reported structure arise not from loss of calcium itself, but from crystal-packing interactions. These interactions produce chelation of the 138± 150 loop in the calcium-depleted protomer into one of the calcium- and phosphocholine-binding sites of a neighbouring pentamer in the crystal, leading to loss of the Arg47 to main-chain Ser149 and Ser151 hydrogen bonds and signi®cant movement of the 43±48, 68±72 and 85±91 loops (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996). These hydrogen bonds are intact in the present structure and there is no signi®cant movement in any of the three loops. In two of the ten independent protomers in the native calcium-bound protomers, a crystal contact between Glu147 and Arg58 in a neighbouring protomer results in a low-occupancy calcium site in these two protomers (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996), although L1 is still correctly folded in for calcium binding.
4.2. The decamer in the crystal

mers of the homologous human serum amyloid P-component (hSAP) complexed with the ligand 2H -deoxyadenosine-5H monophosphate (dAMP) aggregate in the crystal through dAMP±dAMP interactions to form a decamer with the calcium-binding pentameric faces forming the decameric interface (Hohenester et al., 1997). While recent results suggest that human hSAP is a single uncomplexed pentamer in whole serum (Hutchinson et al., 2000), X-ray and neutron scattering results combined with molecular modelling (Ashton et al., 1997) suggest that native calcium-bound hSAP aggregates to form a physiological helix-to-helix decamer very similar to that reported here but perhaps with a relative rotation of 36 between P1 and P2. Despite the high sequence and structural homology between hSAP and hCRP, the relative protomer orientation within the pentameric aggregate

Despite many attempts using various NCS combinations during re®nement and repeated model building, the ten van der Waals contacts across the decameric interface could not be equalized. The contacts between protomers AJ and CH Ê could not be extended beyond 3.1 A, Ê while all others were 3.3 A or greater. While this may suggest small deviations from 52 symmetry, the electron density at this resolution is relatively poor, a situation exacerbated by the twinning (see below). The decamer formation and the associated local conformational changes are probably a consequence of crystal packing, although other calciumdepleted human CRP crystal forms do appear to contain similar decamers (Shrive, Holden et al., 1996). Two penta-

differs by 14 (Shrive, Holden et al., 1996). Furthermore, the conformation of the `jug-handle' loop 177±182 differs markedly between the two pentraxins (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996) and Thr173 in hCRP is serine in hSAP. The crystal contact in calcium-depleted hCRP revealed here (Pro179± Thr173) and the nature of the resulting decameric structure are thus unlikely to be re¯ected in the decameric form of hSAP.
4.3. Crystal packing and twinning

In considering and visualizing the twinning and its relationship to the NCS, it is convenient to translate the asymmetric unit decamer centre to z = 0 and to consider this decamer and the other decamers in that z layer related by unit-cell translations in a and b (Fig. 3). These decamers contain an NCS twofold which is approximately perpendicular to z and near-parallel to [110] and which approximately bisects the a and b axes (Fig. 3c). Since the diffraction pattern exhibits perfect (at this resolution) 422 symmetry, the twinning twofold is necessarily parallel to but not necessarily coincident with (in this case) the [110] direction. Any signi®cant angular deviation from parallel to [110] would produce two visibly distinct (split spots) rather than a single (overlaid spots) diffraction pattern. In this tetragonal system, a strictly parallel relationship between the decameric NCS twofold and [110] would give non-crystallographic symmetry extending throughout the crystal within each layer of z (see Fig. 3), any deviations arising from contacts between layers. The contacts within each layer (protomer B to protomer G and D to J) would then be

NCS-related, with the BG and DJ interfaces essentially identical. A small deviation of the NCS twofold from parallel to [110] is revealed by the calculated direction of the NCS dyad (0.6 from [110]) and by the non-equivalence of the BG and JD intra-layer contact interfaces formed by the NCSrelated protomer pairs BJ and GD. This deviation is further evidenced by the ordered L1F loop and the L1F (Asn145) contact with Thr17A in a neighbouring decamer (see Fig. 3). This contact is also within the z layers but the NCS-related L1C (145)±17I contact is not present, L1C being disordered with no coherent density. The propensity of the crystals to invariably form apparently perfect twins suggests a parallel or near-parallel relationship between the twinning twofold and an NCS twofold such that the twin is locally near-identical, owing to the NCS, to the original structure in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of the decamers within a z layer. The structure solution con®rms this relationship, with the NCS twofold approximately perpendicular to z being near-parallel to the twinning [110] twofold. The twinned crystal can then be most easily viewed (although there are many other equivalent scenarios) as consisting of two halves related by a twinning twofold parallel to [110], the z layer at the interface being a part of one of the halves but with each of the decamers in this layer being related by twofold NCS (approximately parallel to [110]) to the decamer it replaces in the other half (see Fig. 6). As the NCS dyad and the twinning axis are not exactly parallel, this mode of twinning would give rise to structural perturbations at and either side of the twinning interface. The dif®culties in establishing good geometry for the intra-layer contacts, and to a lesser extent the inter-layer contacts, suggests that this is indeed the case, with the crystal being composed of multiple twinned regions such that the perturbed contacts at the twinning interfaces are a signi®cant component of the average structure. The decamers at the twinning interface, rather than being correctly aligned to the structure on one side of the interface, may adopt an intermediate conformation with the NCS dyad strictly parallel to [110], such that the layer is equally disposed to the twin-related regions either side of the interface. The weak diffraction to only medium resolution perhaps re¯ects this disorder. A further consequence of the non-coincidence of the NCS twofold with the line which bisects the a and b axes (Fig. 3c) is that this proposed mode of twinning would give rise to a translation in the [110] (or [110]) direction between the two `halves' of the crystal (Fig. 6). This Ê translation arises from the shift (calculated as 5.8 A) between the two twin-related pairs of solutions from the rotation and translation functions.

Gln150) no longer being directed towards the calcium ions but being positioned and available for external interaction (Fig. 7). Glu81, which interacts with the positively charged quaternary amine in the PC-bound structure (Thompson et al., 1999), and the calcium coordinators Asp60 and Asn61 are also available for external interaction. This major change in the electrostatic surface is of signi®cance to binding studies on calciumdepleted hCRP. hCRP has been shown to exhibit af®nity for polycations only in the absence of calcium or the presence of calcium and bound PC. The externally available Asp60, Asn61, Glu81 and the highly polarized loop L1 in the calciumdepleted structure are prime candidates for polycation binding. The af®nity of calcium-bound, PC-complexed hCRP for polycations may simply re¯ect a charge±charge interaction between the phosphate moiety and polycation ligands. The crystal contacts in the calcium-depleted structure reveal how interaction with positively charged residues in polycation ligands such as poly-l-lysine (DiCamelli et al., 1980; Potempa et al., 1981) may occur. The calcium-depleted hCRP± polycation interaction is mimicked by the crystal contacts of L2G(D) (through Arg58 and Gln59) with L1B(J) (Asp140 and Ser141) and L3G(D) (through Lys122) with L2B(J) (Asp60) (see Fig. 5). plays a dual role in controlling both the biological activity and the stability of human CRP.

5. Conclusions
Structural studies of human CRP now provide a full description of the structural basis of calcium binding and of binding to PC (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996; Thompson et al., 1999), while structural and related studies have de®ned the topology and structure of the binding site for complement component C1q (Agrawal et al., 2001). C1q binding and complement activation by hCRP requires ligand-complexed hCRP and it is now clear that conjugated PC, e.g. PnC, rather than simple PC is required (Szalai et al., 1999). Indeed, binding of simple PC produces no signi®cant changes in either the protomeric or pentameric structure (Thompson et al., 1999). Whether there are structural changes arising from binding of conjugated PC, transmitted around the surface of the protomer to the C1q site (Agrawal et al., 2001) through a series of three loops (Shrive, Cheetham et al., 1996) or by protomer tilt, or whether there is direct interaction between C1q and the bound polysaccharide tail, is not yet clear. The present study reveals how the presence of calcium produces conformational changes which lead to increased stability of human CRP and to the formation of the binding site for the PC head group of physiological ligands. The position of Glu147, which is Asp in hSAP and does not extend into the calcium-binding pocket, appears to be critical for the binding af®nity for the second calcium ion in hCRP. Low calcium concentrations may lead to not only reduced af®nity for physiological PC ligands, but also to movement of the 138± 150 loop, resulting in increased susceptibility to proteolysis and denaturation. The availability of this loop for external interaction may also give rise to a binding af®nity for polycations including physiological lysine- and arginine-rich ligands. Through the 138±150 loop, calcium ion concentration
