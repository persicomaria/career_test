Abstract--4-Sulfamoyl pyrroles were designed as novel hepatoselective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) to reduce myalgia, a statin-induced adverse effect. The compounds were prepared via a [3 + 2] cycloaddition of a Munchnone with a sulfonamide¨ substituted alkyne. We identified compounds with greater selectivity for hepatocytes compared to L6-myocytes than rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. There was an inverse correlation of myocyte potencies and C log P values. A number of analogs were effective at reducing cholesterol in acute and chronic in vivo models but they lacked sufficient chronic in vivo activity to warrant further development. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is well documented that coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death in the US and is positively correlated with a high plasma LDL-C level.1,2 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the treatment of choice for lowering plasma LDL-C. Since lovastatin was first introduced in the 1980s, other statins have made their way to the market with improved efficacy: for example, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and the latest addition, rosuvastatin. The most common adverse effect associated with the statins is myalgia, manifested by muscle stiffness, muscle weakness, fatigue, and cramps.3 It is thought that the cause of this side effect is inhibition of myocytic HMG-CoA reductase.4 It has also been suggested that statins with greater hepatoselectivity may help reduce the observed side effect as they are less available to muscle tissues.5,6 One way to obtain hepatoselective statins is to utilize organic anion transporting polypeptides

(OATPs) since these uptake transporters are expressed on hepatocytes but not on myocytes, and statins are known to be viable substrates.17 By making statins more hydrophilic, one could anticipate reducing non-selective passive diffusion into all cells and increasing selectivity for cells capable of internalizing statins through active transport. However, at the design stage it is challenging to determine the optimal hydrophilicity of novel statins. Thus, we elected to use atorvastatin 1 as a starting point and to evaluate the impact on tissue selectivity of altering its lipophilicity. In order to rapidly assess tissue selectivity, we used hepatocytes and L6-myocytes as primary assays. Statins have been successfully co-crystallized with HMG-CoA reductase.18 As shown in Figure 1, salient features of the binding of atorvastatin to the enzyme include (i) strong hydrogen bonding interactions provided by the 3,5-dihydroxy heptanoic acid fragment of 1; (ii) the isopropyl group fitting into a small lipophilic pocket; and (iii) a hydrogen bonding interaction between the 4carboxamide oxygen and the hydroxyl group of Ser 565. Similarly, it is known that rosuvastatin 2, one of the most efficacious statins, forms a strong hydrogen bond with Ser 565 through a sulfonamide oxygen, and it

provided a diastereomeric mixture of 4-fluorophenylglycine derivative 5.11­13 Acylation of this amine with isobutyryl chloride proceeded smoothly to generate the methyl ester 6, which was hydrolyzed with methanolic LiOH to give the Mu ¨nchnone precursor 7. The synthesis of the alkynyl tertiary sulfonamides is shown in Scheme 3.7 Reaction of methane sulfonyl chloride with the appropriate amine gave the sulfonamide 10 in high yields. To prepare alkynyl secondary sulfonamides, a 2,4,6-trimethoxy benzyl protecting group for the NH was utilized, which was installed via reductive amination of sulfonamides 10 (Scheme 3). Proton abstraction from 10 with n-BuLi followed by reaction with the appropriate ester gave good yields of the b-keto sulfonamides 11. The alkynyl sulfonamides 12 were formed in excellent yields by reaction of 11 with 2chloro-N-methyl pyridinium iodide under basic conditions.7 As shown in Scheme 4, heating of 7 with acetic anhydride in toluene formed the Mu ¨nchnone 13 in situ, which reacted with the alkynes 12 to afford the pyrroles 14 in good yields. Theoretically, two sulfamoyl pyrrole regioisomers are possible during the cycloaddition. Only the desired regioisomer, with the sulfonamide at the 4position, was formed.20 As evidenced in an X-ray crystal structure of 16a (Fig. 2), the observed regioselectivity can be rationalized by the preferred orientation of the alkyne sulfonamide 12 in relation to the Munchnone 7 ¨ prior to the cycloaddition. Treatment of 14 with trifluoroacetic acid removed the trimethoxybenzyl group from the sulfonamide nitrogen, cleaved the tert-butyl esters and acetonide, affording the lactones 15. Finally, the lactone was treated with one equivalent of 1 N NaOH and lyophilized to yield the pyrrole sodium salts 16. As shown in Figure 2, an X-ray co-crystal structure of 16a and the enzyme confirmed the desired regioisomer. It is noteworthy that the compound uses a water molecule as a hydrogen bonding bridge to Ser 565. The bridging water molecule appears to be a general feature

As a general chemistry strategy we retained the 5-member heterocyclic core of atorvastatin as a key scaffold as well as the essential interactions within the active site of the enzyme, and elected to investigate replacement of the carboxamide moiety with a sulfonamide. We envisioned that a [3 + 2] cycloaddition of two components, a Munchnone 13 and an alkyne substituted ¨ with sulfonamide 12 (Scheme 1), might achieve efficient construction of a penta-substituted 4-sulfamoyl pyrrole.14 Formation of pyrroles from the reactions of alkynes with Munchnones has been reported with ¨ sulfonyl alkynes.8,9 The synthesis of the Munchnone precursor 7 is shown in ¨ Scheme 2. 4-Fluorophenylacetic acid 3 was esterified to produce the corresponding ester followed by bromination using NBS under acidic condition to afford the abromo ester 4.

The ratio of Cmax/L6 value is more consistent with the incidence of myalgia. Examples of the 4-sulfamoyl pyrrole analogs are shown in an order of hepatoselectivity in Table 2. In general, most of the analogs exhibited excellent potency in vitro and selectivity toward hepatocyte over myocyte, particularly, the N-cycloalkyl sulfonamides, that is, 16a, 16b, 16c, and 16d. The ring size seemed to have little effect on the selectivity until the azetidine sulfonamide, 16k. Interestingly, the rotation-restricted analog 16q showed no markedly better in vitro potency than the N-benzyl sulfonamide analog, 16h. In addition, it was observed that the secondary sulfonamide 16h was more hepatoselective than 16q or the N-methyl benzyl sulfonamide analogs, 16r and 16s. The meta-substituted phenyl sulfonamides, that is, 16e, 16f, and 16g were more hepatoselective than the para-substituted analogs, that is, 16o and 16p. It was interesting to see that the phenyl sulfonamide analogs 16t, 16u, and 16v showed the poorest hepatoselectivity as these analogs are structurally the closest to atorvastatin 1. The observed low selectivity was consistent with the higher C log P values (5.95,

The highest hepatoselectivity is found in rosuvastatin (926) and the lowest selectivity in cerivastatin (4.1). The percent myalgia incidence correlates with the hepatoselectivity with the exception of rosuvastatin.

were less efficacious in reducing LDL-C (16a À11%, 16c À38%, 16l À30%) than rosuvastatin (À62%). In conclusion, we have designed, prepared, and tested 4-sulfamoyl pyrrole analogs as novel inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. Some of the most potent analogs showed excellent selectivity (superior to rosuvastatin) toward hepatocytes over myocytes. It was observed that the L6-myocytic potency is inversely correlated with the C log P of the analog. Although some analogs effectively inhibited cholesterol synthesis acutely in a mouse model and lowered LDL-C chronically, none of the compounds had efficacy greater than or equal to that of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin.

5.76, and 5.32, respectively) compared to that of atorvastatin (4.46) as shown in Table 2. A plot of L6 myocyte IC50 vs C log P is presented in Figure 3. In general, the L6-myocyte potency showed an inverse correlation to the C log P values. Interestingly, the majority of the 4-sulfamoyl pyrrole analogs possess higher myocyte IC50s than rosuvastatin, despite having higher C log Ps and similar hepatocyte IC50s. This suggests that the observed inverse correlation of L6 IC50 and C log P likely holds only within a specific structural class. Based on the data presented in Table 1 for marketed statins, we would expect these new sulfamoylpyrroles to have reduced potential for myalgia relative to current therapies. In general, cycloalkyl sulfonamide analogs (e.g., 16a, 16b, 16c, and 16d) showed high in vivo acute cholesterol-synthesis inhibition (MAICS). Incidentally, these analogs were also highly hepatoselective (ca. > 10,000). Several analogs exceeded 50% reduction in MAICS as seen in column (e) in Table 2. The best analogs were run in the chronic in vivo hamster efficacy model.19 Unfortunately, the best compounds
