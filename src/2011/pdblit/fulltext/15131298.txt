from the core. In the hottest regions of D, melt may be convectively stirred throughout D, as suggested in panel B of the figure. Preferred orientation of melt pockets or sheets can give rise to observed shearwave splitting (12). Although the shear velocities at the base of the large low-velocity province in panel C are indeed low, they are not characterized as a ULVZ, because minimal P-wave anomalies are detected; this low-velocity structure may be distinct from the rest of D (as suggested in the figure), because its sharp and steep sides within D imply its abrupt onset and uniqueness from its surroundings (11), which cannot be explained with solely thermal scenarios--introduction of chemically unique material is necessary. Evidence also exists for anomalous material on the fluid core side of the CMB (13), which might be related to underside-CMB sedimentation (8). Future work should adopt a multiphase approach--one that incorporates both diffracted and reflected energy, in order to better constrain the bulk properties and sharpness of ULVZ features. In some D locations beneath subduction, as well as hotspots (all panels of the figure), evidence has mounted for smallscale inhomogeneities or scatterers (<10 km to hundreds of km) from a variety of seismological probes, such as precursors to coda arrivals to core reflected, refracted, and diffracted P and S waves of all types (14). Although not now well constrained, these may include the aforementioned pockets of ULVZ material at the CMB and possible mid-D low-velocity structures (such as depicted in panel A), ULVZ melt material swept around D (panel B, for exBIOPHYSICS

etalloproteins are involved in biological processes ranging from energy transduction, to cellular signaling, to modification of organic substrates. These processes often depend on the binding, activation, or generation of simple diatomic molecules like O2, N2, H2, NO, and CO at the active-site metal ion(s) (1). The metal-diatom adducts are fleeting intermediates in the catalytic pathways, making them difficult to characterize. However, knowing their chemical proper-

ties is key to understanding how the metalloenzymes function. In this issue, Tocheva et al. on page 867 (2) and Prigge et al. on page 864 (3) describe x-ray crystal structures of reactive intermediates in two important copper enzymes. Novel coordination geometries of O2 and NO each bound to a single copper ion provide intriguing mechanistic insights and set the stage for further synthetic and biological study. In generating nitric oxide (NO) from nitrite (NO2-) during anaerobic bacterial metabolism (see the figure), the copper-containing nitrite reductase (NiR) plays a key role in the global nitrogen cycle. Previous studies of NiR in its resting state revealed three histidine ligands and a water moleVOL 304 SCIENCE

cule coordinated to the catalytic Cu(II) center (4, 5). Nitrite binds at this center and is converted to NO, presumably via a copper-nitrosyl intermediate ([CuNO]2+), although this has not been observed. Indeed, structurally defined copper-nitrosyls are rare, the only monocopper examples being in amine oxidase (6) and a synthetic complex LCuNO (L, tridentate anionic ligand) (7), both of which feature end-on coordination of the NO ligand through the N atom. Now, Tocheva et al. (2) show that treatment of reduced NiR with NO in the absence of excess reductant yields a stable copper-nitrosyl ([CuNO]+) that features side-on coordination with the copper binding to both the N and O atoms (see the figure). The observation of side-on binding is striking, because although it is established for synthetic O2 adducts of copper (8, 9), such a binding mode for NO has only been seen in metastable complexes of other metals trapped at low temperatures (10, 11).

ample), and topographical variations at comparable lateral scales for the D discontinuity or ULVZ, which are expected at scales comparable to convective currents within and above the layer. Although the environments schematically illustrated in the panels of the figure are certainly very different from one another, they probably represent only a subset of deep-mantle possibilities. A framework that ties them together involves strong lateral variations in temperature and partial melt content, as well as composition, which should modulate the topographical structure and dynamical behavior of a global D layer (2). These lateral perturbations can govern variations in heat flow from the core, and thus the vigor and style of internal D and overlying convection, including the birth of mantle plumes, D anisotropy, and ultralow velocities right at the CMB. If the phase change discussed by Murakami et al. (1) corresponds to the top of D, it may certainly provide unanticipated explanations to many observations, including the geometry of D anisotropy, the strength and degree of mineral alignment, the relation (difference) between P- and S-wave discontinuity strength, and the geometry of melt within D. Other important avenues to be explored will be investigations of possible temperature-dependent iron partitioning into or out of the new post-perovskite phase, and better constraints on the Clapeyron slope, each of which are far-reaching. Community interest in advancing our knowledge in this arena is reflected in the success of the National Science Foundation's Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior (CSEDI) program (15),

which funds multidisciplinary research on the structure and dynamics of Earth's interior, particularly aimed at processes that affect Earth's surface. Future analyses will bring into better focus the details of this new CMB paradigm through such a multidisciplinary approach.

the basis of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the adduct is described as a Cu(II) complex of NO-, although more rigorous study is needed to confirm this assignment. The side-on binding observed by Tocheva et al. in the NO adduct offers a possible solution to a mechanistic puzzle. Nitrite has been shown to bind to the oxidized NiR active-site Cu(II) via its O atoms (12), thus implicating an unprecedented Obound copper-nitrosyl intermediate after reduction and dehydration. Tocheva et al. suggest instead that the specific arrangement of surrounding active-site residues provides hydrogen-bonding interactions that would favor a side-on bonded [CuNO]2+ catalytic intermediate similar to the structurally defined [CuNO]+ species. However, changing the redox state might perturb the binding interactions, and an alternative mechanism involving N-coordination of nitrite to the reduced enzyme and subsequent dehydration to a N-bound [CuNO]2+ species remains feasible (13). Distinguishing among these mechanisms is a challenge for future research. Prigge et al. (3) identified copper-coordinated O2 in peptidylglycine -hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM), an enzyme

involved in the activation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides. In the PHM reaction, the pro-S hydrogen at the C position of a terminal glycine residue is abstracted by a copper-oxygen species to yield a glycyl radical intermediate (see the figure). Until now the copper-oxygen intermediate had not been observed because it forms only after substrate is bound in position to be attacked. In a clever trick aimed at trapping the intermediate, Prigge et al. soaked crystals of reduced PHM with a substrate, N-acetyl-diiodo-tyrosyl-D-threonine (IYT), designed to react slowly because hydrogen abstraction would yield a relatively unstable threonine-based radical. The x-ray structure of this presoaked crystal exposed to dioxgen revealed bound IYT and an O2 moiety coordinated end-on to the His2Met-ligated copper site (see the figure). This [CuO2]+ unit is the first example of a monocopper-dioxygen intermediate [other than weakly bound H2O2 in amine oxidase (6)] to be structurally defined in a protein. In addition, it is distinct from the only other reported synthetic examples, which feature side-on instead of end-on coordination of the O2-derived ligand (8, 9). Presumably, the intermediate is best described as a Cu(II)-superoxide, alSCIENCE VOL 304

PERSPECTIVES though just as for the nitrosyl in NiR, more study is required before its electronic structure can be confidently defined. Is the crystallographically identified end-on [CuO2]+ unit responsible for hydroxylating substrate? Evidence is mounting that it may be. Although Prigge et al. postulate that it first gains one electron, kinetic results recently obtained for a closely related enzyme, dopamine -monooxygenase, were explained by invoking direct attack of substrate by a [CuO2]+ intermediate (14). In addition, the competence of a Cu(II)-superoxide to perform the H-atom abstraction step in PHM has been supported by theoretical calculations (15). Interestingly, in the x-ray structure (see the figure), the end-on O2-derived ligand points away from the C hydrogen of the substrate IYT (>3 Å distant). However, a simple rotation about the Cu-O bond places the terminal O atom of the ligand within 2.2 Å of this hydrogen, in perfect position for abstraction via a C-HO transition state. Recognition of this feature led Prigge et al. to make several notable mechanistic suggestions, including the provocative hypothesis that the Cu-O bond rotation may constitute a motion that "gates" quantum mechanical tunneling intrinsic to the C-H bond cleavage step (16). Further evaluation of this idea is eagerly awaited. Thus, the identification of new binding modes for adducts of NO and O2 in the xray structures of NiR and PHM provide important information about possible intermediates in catalysis. These structures also raise new questions that will inspire future biochemical and synthetic modeling studies and, ultimately, will lead to deeper understanding of metal-diatom interactions.
