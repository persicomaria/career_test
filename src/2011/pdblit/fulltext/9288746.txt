SUMMARY Effect of tropomyosin and troponin on the rheological properties of F-actin in solution was investigated by the use of a rotational viscometer and an apparatus for measuring dynamic viscoelasticity. Tropomyosin reduced the rate of gelation of F-actin as measured in a very slowly rotating viscometer, although the final value of the viscosity of the tropomyosin-F-actin complex was higher than that of F-actin alone. The effect of tropomyosin was discussed in relation to the change in flexibility of F-actin filaments by tropomyosin. The dynamic rigidity and loss moduli of F-actin were increased by the tropomyosin binding. Structural viscosity, dynamic rigidity modulus and loss modulus of the tropomyosin-F-actin complex was remarkably increased by the addition of troponin. The rheological properties of the troponin-tropomyosin-F-actin complex became dependent on free Ca 2+ concentrations at micromolar level, after treated at 45 °C. In the presence of more than 10-5 M Ca 2+, the values of dynamic rigidity and loss moduli were very low, whereas in the absence of Ca 2+ ( < 10-s M) the values were as high as the initial ones before the heat treatment. The Ca2+-dependent action of troponin was substituted for by its components, TN-C and TN-T.

INTRODUCTION The regulation by Ca 2+ of muscle function in vertebrates is effected by the Ca~+-receptive protein, troponin, bound to tropomyosin on the F-actin filament (for review, refs 1 and 2). A number of investigations have been performed in order to determine the effect of tropomyosin and troponin on the physical properties of F-actin. Among them the recent work with the quasielastic light-scattering technique by Fujime and Ishiwata [3] is of particular interest: F-actin becomes stiff when tropomyosin is bound, and with a further binding of troponin, the flexibility of F-actin filaments becomes dependent on the free Ca2+-concentrations [4]. Furthermore, Ishiwata [5] reported that the gel formation of the troponin-tropomyosinF-actin complex is affected by Ca 2+ concentrations.

31 In a previous article [6], we showed that F-actin forms a network in solution by a rheological study. The present study is concerned with the changes in the rheological properties of F-actin solution evoked by the binding of tropomyosin and troponin. The action of Ca 2+ is also described. EXPERIMENTAL

Preparation of proteins
All the proteins were extracted from rabbit skeletal muscle. Actin was purified according to Spudich and Watt [7]. Tropomyosin free of troponin was prepared as described previously [8]. Troponin was purified by the method of Ebashi et al. [9]. The three components of troponin, TN-C, -I and -T, were isolated from troponin [10] and were kindly supplied by Professor Ebashi. The protein samples were checked by sodium dodecylsulphate gel electrophoresis for purity and only pure samples were used for the present study.

Physical technique
A Quette-type viscometer, Low-Shear 100 (Contraves AG) and a home-made apparatus for measuring dynamic viscoelasticity were employed as described in the preceding paper [6]. Temperature was regulated by circulating water from a thermostat. RESULTS

Effect of tropomyosin
As described in the preceding paper [6], an F-actin solution shows a low value of viscosity at a very low velocity gradient when the measurement has just begun and the value gradually increases due to the formation of the F-actin network. In the presence of tropomyosin, the rate of increase in the viscosity was remarkably reduced, and the retardation increased up to 30 ~ of tropomyosin to actin by weight (Fig. 1).

32 It is to be noted that the inhibition occurred only at the initial stage; thus the final value of the viscosity of F-actin in the presence of tropomyosin was higher than that in its absence (cf. Fig. 3). This tendency is clearly seen with only 10 % tropomyosin (Fig. 1). The decrease in the rate of the viscosity increase of an F-actin solution by the tropomyosin binding was found to be dependent on the velocity gradient in the measurement. As shown in Fig. 2, the lower the velocity gradient, the greater the effect of tropomyosin: at 0.008 s-1, the effect was hardly observed. It was also observed that the tropomyosin action became less marked at high protein concentrations. Thus even at 0.002 s-1, the effect of tropomyosin (30 %) was negligible at an F-actin concentration of 2 mg/ml, and at 3 mg/ml the rate of the F-actin-tropomyosin complex was larger than that of control F-actin. These observations explain the reason why the addition of tropomyosin results in the increase in viscosity of an F-actin solution, when measured by a conventional viscometer of the Ostwald type (cf. ref. 11).

On the other hand, the final saturated values of viscosity at a low velocity gradient became considerably larger in the presence of tropomyosin than in its absence (Fig. 3). Dynamic viscoelastic measurements revealed that both the rigidity modulus (G') and the Joss modulus (G") of an F-actin solution increased by the tropomyosin binding (Figs 4a and 4b). The value of the dynamic rigidity modulus of F-actin was doubled by tropomyosin (Fig. 4b).

Effect of troponin in the presence of tropomyosin
The Ca~+-receptive protein, troponin, alone did not affect the rheological properties of F-actin. However, in the presence of tropomyosin, troponin now markedly influenced F-actin. Fig. 5 illustrates the remarkable enhancement of the rate of an F-actin solution in the structural viscosity by troponin and tropomyosin.

34 The rate was more than 5-fold at a velocity gradient of 0.002 s -1. The final value of the viscosity was also much increased, although to a lesser extent than the rate of increase in viscosity (Fig. 3). The dynamic rigidity and loss moduli values of an F-actin solution were also greatly elevated by troponin with tropomyosin, as presented in Figs 4a and 4b. The final values of G ' and G" were 14 times and 4 times as large, respectively, as those of the F-actin solution alone.

Ca2+ dependence of troponin-tropomyosin-F-actin complex
By the use of the flow birefringence technique Ishiwata reported that the troponin-tropomyosin-F-actin complex gelated again in the absence of Ca z+ (below 10 -8 M), after incubation at 45 °C and cooling to r o o m temperature. In the present study the effect of temperature on the dynamic rigidity modulus of the troponintropomyosin-F-actin complex was investigated in the presence and absence of Ca 2+ (Fig. 6). The value of G ' decreased considerably as the temperature was elevated regardless of Ca z+. However, on lowering the temperature, G ' returned to almost the same level as the initial one in the absence of Ca 2+, but it was remarkably lower than the initial values in the presence of Ca 2+. Similar profiles were obtained with the values of G" under the same conditions.

The above observations were confirmed by measuring the rate of increase in viscosity at a low velocity gradient. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 7, the rate did not appreciably change after heating for 10 rain at 45 °C in the absence of Ca 2+, whereas it greatly decreased in the presence of Ca 2÷. The change in the rate of increase in the viscosity after the heat treatment was plotted against the free Ca2+-concentration. Fig. 8 shows that a half-maximal change occurred at 2 × 10 -6 M Ca 2~, which was comparable with Ca2+-induced conformational changes of troponin (cf. refs 1 and 2). Although the extent of gelation of the troponin-tropomyosin-F-actin complex after the heat treatment was quite different depending on the free Ca 2+ concentrations, the final values of the structural viscosity at low velocity gradients did not change, when measured at a suitably diluted protein concentration of F-actin (0.05 mg/ml) (Fig. 9).

The role of the troponin components
It is well established that troponin consists of three components, C (Ca z~binding protein), I (actin-myosin interaction inhibitor) and T (tropomyosin-binding protein). An investigation was carried out to determine what components were responsible for the Ca~+-dependent change in the rheological properties of the F-actin-tropomyosin complex. T N - T and -I, but not T N - C increased the rate of increase in viscosity (Fig. 10a). The action of T N - I was largely abolished by TN-C, and the effect of Ca z+ was slight in this case. On the other hand, the addition of T N - C only slightly affected the action of TN-T, and furthermore, the Ca2÷-dependent effect was evident in the presence of T N - T and -C. Further addition of T N - I did not result in any more change (Fig. 10c). Therefore, it is concluded that T N - C and -T are primarily involved in the present case.

DISCUSSION Tropomyosin is stoichiometrically bound to F-actin [12], very probably along the groove of the F-actin helices [1, 13]. When tropomyosin is bound to F-actin, values of the flow birefringence [12], viscosity [1 l] and sedimentation coefficient [14] are increased in comparison with intact F-actin. The increase in the saturated values of the structural viscosity of F-actin due to tropomyosin binding at low velocity gradients observed in the present study is explained by a mere increase in the mass which is involved in solution viscosity, as in previous reports [11, 12, 14]. This is also the case with a moderate increase in dynamic rigidity and loss moduli. The decrease in the rate of increase in the structural viscosity of the tropomyesin-F-actin complex on measurement is of special interest. This fact simply means that the extent of entanglement of the F-actin filaments is reduced after the binding of tropomyosin. In this connection, the results with quasielastic light scattering [3] are very suggestive: F-actin filaments become less flexible or stiffer as tropomyosin is bound. Moreover, N o n o m u r a (see ref. 15) observed under the electron

37 microscope that pure F-actin filaments are entangled with each other and the fine filamentous structure deteriorates more or less and tropomyosin or tropomyosin plus troponin can restore the usual double-stranded helical structure. These considerations strongly support the interpretation that it is more difficult for tropomyosin-bound F-actin filaments to form a network in solution than for pure F-actin filaments. Ebashi and his school [1, 2] have established that troponin is located at a special binding site on the tropomyosin molecule bound to the F-actin filament. Previous observations using the technique of flow birefringence measurements showed that troponin greatly enhances the inter-filamental interaction of tropomyosin-bound F-actin [5, 16]. The present study clearly confirms this phenomenon by dynamic viscoelasticity and structural viscosity measurements. The increased value of the dynamic rigidity modulus especially shows the formation of the 5-fold crosslinks between the tropomyosin-bound F-actin filaments in the presence of troponin. The Ca 2+ dependence of the physical properties of the troponin-tropomyosinF-actin complex was first described by Ishiwata and Fujime [4]. They treated the complex for 10 rain at 45 °C to disperse large aggregates. The troponin-tropomyosinF-actin complex was less flexible in the absence of Ca z+ than in the presence, and the rotational diffusion constant was markedly decreased by Ca ~+ suggesting the gelation of the complexes [4]. Further, Ishiwata [5] using flow birefringence technique showed that the extent of gelation of the troponin-tropomyosin-F-actin complex was dependent on the Ca 2+ concentration. The present observations present more clear-cut evidence for the CaZ+-dependent rheological properties of the troponin-tropomyosinF-actin complex. In the presence of Ca 2+ the concentration of which induces interaction of myosin and actin, the troponin-tropomyosin-F-actin complex, i.e. thin filament, becomes stiff [4] and the entanglement with each other only slight. Troponin is known to consist of three components, TN-T, -C and -I. The present experiments demonstrated that both TN-T and -I enhanced the gelation of the tropomyosin-F-actin complex and TN-C did not affect it at all (cf. refs 17 and 18). In the Ca2+-dependent action on the rheological properties of the tropomyosin-Factin complex, TN-T and TN-C could substitute for the whole troponin complex (Fig. 10). It is currently thought that Ca 2+ binds to TN-C, the induced conformational changes of TN-C are transmitted both to TN-T and TN-I and finally TN-I ceases its inhibitory action on F-actin-myosin interaction (cf. refs 19 and 20). Hence in the case of the complex of TN-C, TN-T, tropomyosin and F-actin, the Ca2+-induced changes in TN-C must be transmitted to tropomyosin and then to F-actin through TN-T, which is bound to tropomyosin [9, 21]. More details in the changes by Ca 2+ in the interaction of the troponin-tropomyosin-F-actin complex remain to be elucidated. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Professor S.
