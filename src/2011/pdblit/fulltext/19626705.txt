ABSTRACT Bispecific immunoglobulinlike antibodies capable of engaging multiple antigens represent a promising new class of therapeutic agents. Engineering of these molecules requires optimization of the molecular properties of one of the domain components. Here, we present a detailed crystallographic and computational characterization of the stabilization patterns in the lymphotoxinbeta receptor (LTbR) binding Fv domain of an anti-LTbR/ anti-TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor-2 (TRAIL-R2) bispecific immunoglobulin-like antibody. We further describe a new hierarchical structure-guided approach toward engineering of antibody-like molecules to enhance their thermal and chemical stability.

INTRODUCTION Protein stability has gained increasing attention in recent years due to the growing prominence of protein therapeutics. In addition to engineering protein sequences, increased stability has been attained by identifying additives to stabilize protein formulations for extended shelf life.1 Unfortunately, a number of pathways exist whereby marginally stable proteins may lose their function as they form either soluble or insoluble aggregate structures.2 Such non-native aggregates are routinely encountered in biopharmaceutical processing during fermentation, refolding, and purification of materials, as well as shipping and product storage. For monoclonal antibodies, such aggregation issues are often more pronounced due to their complex multidomain structure. An increasing number of therapeutic molecules are based on re-engineered antibody fragments.3 Although these fragment-based molecules may possess more favorable therapeutic profiles compared with parent IgGs, they may not be as stable. This further emphasizes the need for understanding and engineering protein stability. A variety of experimental and computational methods are in use to increase molecular stability including directed evolution4,5 and computational protein design.6 Although these and other methods have largely been successful in generating more stable molecules, the ultimate goal of understanding the molecular contributions to stabilization and arriving at rapid robust tools for protein engineering has remained challenging. Recently, we have described a protein-engineering approach for producing stable, scalable bispecific Ig-like antibody that targets and crosslinks two TNF family member receptors, TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor-2 (TRAIL-R2) and lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbR).7 This bispecific antibody composed of a stabilityengineered anti-LTbR single chain Fv (scFv) genetically fused to the heavy chain of a full-length anti-TRAIL-R2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody possesses long serum half-live and was effective in murine tumor xenograft models. Here, we report the computational and crystallographic analysis of the wild-type LTﬂ receptor Fv domain of this Ig-like bispecific antibody directed at human LTﬂR and

TRAIL-R2, and two highly stabilized mutants generated via rational design. Structural analysis reveals important differences that introduce new favorable interactions into the structures and computational energy scores confirm and quantify the basis and magnitude of energetic stabilization. We convert these insights into new hierarchical mutant selection approach based on the stepwise evaluation of the components of the widely accepted Rosetta design energy function. We successfully use this procedure to identify a set of stabilizing mutations based on increased buried hydrophobic surface area not identified by the other computational and theoretical methods used. This combination of structure-based approaches and hierarchical mutant selection criteria is based on physicochemical principles of antibody intradomain interactions, and therefore will be applicable to the engineering of other antibodies to enhance thermal and chemical stability that could lead to optimized manufacturability and shelf life.

individual amino acid frequencies at each residue position. The first nonredundant database of VH, Vk, and Vj domains was compiled through keyword-based sequence extraction from public databases (IgSeqProt, NCBI nonredundant GenBank, Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL, PIR, PDB, IgBLAST, and IMGT) and supplemented with in-house antibody sequences (Hanf, Ganesan, Lugovskoy, unpublished data). The sequences were aligned using Hidden Markov Model built in HHMer10 based on the small hand-curated alignments of VH, Vk, and Vj domains. After removal of incomplete sequences, the database contained 27,022 VH, 4258 Vk, and 9252 Vj domain sequences. The construction of the second reference set of mammalian VH and VL sequences was described previously.9,11 Residues commonly found in human antibody V sequences corresponding to the identified positions were selected for substitutions.12 Only framework residue positions were considered candidates for mutagenesis. Additionally, all framework residues deviating from consensus were mapped on the BHA10 scFv threedimensional model and mutated to consensus, if deemed to be remote from complementarity determining regions.
Structure-based methods

Knowledge-based, statistical, and structure-based methods were used to identify target residues for mutagenesis. These methods are described in detail in Michaelson et al.7 and can be briefly summarized as follows:
Knowledge-based methods

The published strategies for stabilization of VH and VL domains (Ref. 8 and references therein) were analyzed in the context of the BHA10 scFv three-dimensional model and a list of prioritized stabilizing substitutions was selected for experimental follow-up.
Statistical methods

Covariation analysis. We previously produced a data-

base of diverse V-class Ig-fold sequences with the goal of defining structural and functional differences between various V-class Ig-fold protein subfamilies. Covariation analyses using the V-class Ig-fold database were performed to uncover amino acid networks within antibody variable domains that are coconserved for structural and functional purposes. Here, we used the covariation analyses to identify gaps within defined VH or VL amino acid networks.9 Residue positions where making a mutation led to an increase in the number of positively correlated amino acid covariations already existing within the BHA10 sequence were considered for mutagenesis. For example, mutation of V55G led to 129 positive and statistically significant /value correlations coefficients greater than 0.25.9
Frequency analysis. Two in-house databases were used to derive the consensus sequence for scoring and the

The DEEK structure-based protein engineering program is a multilevel dead-end elimination/A* (DEE/ A*)13≠17 search method18 which performs DEE/A* at three levels--sequence, fleximer,19,20 and rotamer21-- and uses multiple hierarchical energy functions. Major advantages of this method for antibody engineering are its detailed Poisson-Boltzmann treatment of solvation and electrostatics22≠24 and its use of both binding and folding energies for selecting promising designs. DEE/A* requires a pairwise-additive approximate energy function25; ours included ``4r'' distance-dependent dielectric electrostatics, van der Waals with all radii scaled by 0.9, and covalent terms (bond, angle, dihedral, and improper dihedral) using the PARAM19 polarhydrogen-only CHARMM26 parameters. Unbound state structures were modeled by rigidly separating the two binding partners. Unfolded states were modeled by isolated solvated model compounds, one per evolving residue. Each amino acid type's unfolded model compound consisted of a fixed backbone extended to the next Ca in both directions; that is, N-acetyl [residue] methylamide [i.e. (CH3)¿ O)¿ H)¿ ¿(C ¿(N ¿(Ca¿ ¿``Residue'')¿ O)¿ ¿(C ¿ H ¿(CH3)], with the side chain atoms beyond Cb (N )¿ minimized to completion using the pairwise-additive approximate energy function with full van der Waals radii, one per evolving residue. Our library of fleximers was defined as in Dunbrack and Karplus,21 and the rotamers within each fleximer were defined by allowing changes of [210, 0, 110] degrees on most dihedrals. In this study, we expanded the choices for hydroxyls, such as the HG1

atom of threonine, to fleximers at [2120, 260, 0, 60, 120, 180] degrees, and three rotamers within each fleximer at [210, 0, 110] degree changes. In addition to the ``evolving'' residues chosen for redesign, all residues (except prolines and disulfide-bonded cystines) within 4 ∞ to 6 A of the evolving residues are made ``molten,'' meaning the rotamer library is used to give them conformational flexibility but not to change their amino acid types. Using a pairwise-additive approximate sequence energy function, DEE/A* in the search space of sequences produced a long list of sequences. Then for each sequence, using a pairwise-additive approximate fleximer energy, DEE/A* in the space of fleximers was used to produce a list of the 10 best fleximer states. Finally, for each fleximer state, using the regular pairwise-additive energy defined above, DEE/A* was used once again to find the one best rotamer state included in that fleximer state. Before each stage of DEE/A*, rotamers (or fleximers in the second stage or sequences in the first) and pairs thereof were disallowed if their binding or folding energy contributions exceeded the cutoff of 25 kcal/mol. After the multilevel DEE/A*, a more accurate energy function, including finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) ESxi, xii, xiii with dielectric constants 4 and 80, was used to further screen the best candidate structures found by DEE/A*. Finally, the mutant sequences considered for synthesis were those that had a structure with better predicted binding energy, and predicted folding energy no more than 1 kcal/mol worse, than the designed wild-type BHA10 structure. Additionally, a modified alanine scanning and interface design protocols27 implemented in Rosetta Design program28 were used to identify potential stabilizing mutations. An original BHA10 homology model used for calculations was built in MODELLER29 based on the proprietary structure of anti-VLA4 antibody HP1/2 and refined using SCWRL3.030 and CHARMM.26

Production of scFvs. Escherichia coli strain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, VA. Cat. # 27325) transformants were grown in 4 3 250 ml SB media (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, CA) containing 50 lg/ml carbenicillin in 1 liter baffled flasks to OD600 (0.8, induced by adding to 0.02% arabinose, and cultured overnight. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation. The pellets were solubilized and lysed using 40 ml B-PER protein extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Solubilized scFv was applied to a 5 ml Ni-NTA-Superflow column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Bound scFv was washed with 60 mM imidazole, pH 8.0 and eluted with 300 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. Eluted scFv was loaded onto a 6 ml Protein L agarose column (Pierce). Bound protein was washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and eluted with 0.1M glycine, pH 3.0. Purified scFvs were dialyzed against PBS and stored at 2208C. Protein concentrations were determined using an e280nm 5 2.1 ml mg21 cm21.

and VL regions were PCR amplified from the appropriate scFv's and used to construct full length antibody heavy and light gene sequences31 and the completed plasmids were used to cotransform CHO host cells. A mixture of 20 lg of plasmid DNA encoding the heavy and light genes were combined with 4 3 106 DG44 CHO cells in a volume of 0.4 ml of 1X PBS. The mixture was added to a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and placed on ice for 15 min. The mixtures were electroporated at 600 uF and 350 volts with a Gene Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). The cells were grown at DHFR and G418-selected media 3 weeks post-transfection. Clonal cell lines were isolated and scaled up for IgG purification using standard techniques.

confirmed ``hits'' were challenged in a thermal gradient, centrifuged to remove aggregated material, and remaining supernatants were tested for binding in the LTbR Fc DELFIA. The numerical value corresponding to the temperature where 50% binding activity is retained is referred to as the T50 value and the units are in 8C. The T50 values are not construed as being equivalent to biophysically derived Tm values. Supernatant aliquots (50100 ll) were transferred to 96-well PCR plates (either 8 in a column or 12 in a row, depending on the gradient functionality of the PCR thermocycler). The PCR thermocyclers were programmed to generate a gradient centered on the T50 value of the parental scFv. For example, hits from a library whose parental scFv had a T50 5 508C were assayed using a 40≠608C gradient. Samples were processed as described above and binding data were

digested with 1 ll papain suspension (Roche cat. #108014) per 5 mg of antibody for 90-120 min at room temperature in 100 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.0. The digested antibodies were loaded onto a SP-5PW-HR ion exchange column (Tosoh Biosep Cat#14714), washed with two column volumes (CVs) of equilibration buffer (20 mM Acetate at pH 5.0), and eluted with a 30 CV linear salt gradient from 0-200 mM NaCl. The peak fractions representing Fab protein were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, concentrated to approximately 10 mg/ml, and stored at 48C for crystallography. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA and purity by densitometry on an SDS-PAGE gel and analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

method at a temperature of 248C by mixing 200 nl of 7 mg/ml BHA10 Fab with 200 nl of the reservoir solution containing 20% PEG 4000, 200 mM calcium acetate 10 mM zinc chloride, and 100 mM Tris at pH 8. Crystals were transferred to mother liquor solutions of increasing concentrations of PEG 550 MME (up to 20%) before harvesting and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of ∞ 1.007 A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) on beam line X29 and at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) on beam line SGX-CAT. The NSLS data set was collected at 21738C using an ADSC q315 CCD detector, whereas APS data set used a MAR 165 detector. Data were integrated, reduced, and scaled using HKL2000. The BHA10 wild-type crystal was indexed in the orthorhombic space group C2, whereas the BHA10 double and quadruple mutants indexed as I222; data statistics are summarized in Supporting Information Table 1.
Structure determination and refinement. The BHA10 wild-type structure was determined by molecular replacement using an in-house murine Fab structure with 95% identity to BHA10 as the search models with the program MolRep32 followed by manual rebuilding with Coot.33 The BHA10 double and quadruple mutant structures were solved similarly using the BHA10 wildtype structure as a search model. Structural refinements were performed using REFMAC5.34 The progress of the model refinements were monitored by cross-validation Rfree, which was computed from a randomly assigned test set comprising 5% of the data. Refinement statistics are summarized in Supporting Information Table 1. No electron density was observed for VH residues of 132-135 of BHA10 wild-type and 132-136 of the mutants. Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the final structures were assessed using Molprobity35 and the AutoDepInputTool (http:// deposit.pdb.org/adit/). Figures were prepared with PYMOL (DeLano Scientific, www.delanoscientific.com). Atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors of BHA10 wildtype, BHA10 double mutant, BHA10 quadruple mutant have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession numbers 3HC0, 3HC3, and 3HC4, respectively.

∞ dues within 4 A of the mutation site were considered when calculating energetic difference between structures.
Rosetta mutations. Rosetta design was performed on

the wild-type crystal structure with a fixed backbone. ∞ Single mutations at each position greater than 4 A from the CDR to the 20 common side chains were created in silico. In place of the default energy function we used one that was recently parameterized to reproduce native protein folds based on a fixed backbone.41 This energy function significantly reduces the Lennard-Jones repulsion energy caused by small atom clashes and more easily accommodates slight changes in structure without backbone movement. Mutations were then filtered based on total Rosetta energy score, SASApack (solvent accessible surface area packing), and Ehbnd (hydrogen bond energy) terms relative to the wild type.

Identification and analysis of stabilizing mutations

Rosetta energy scoring. Solved crystal structures were

used as input for the computational protein design package Rosetta. This Rosetta algorithm has been described in detail elsewhere.36,37 Briefly, Rosetta uses an energy function that is a linear combination of 11 weighted energy terms including but not limited to the LennardJones potential, Lazaridis-Karplus implicit solvation model,38 an orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding term,39 torsion potentials for backbone and side chain,40 a reference energy for the 20 amino acid types that approximates their energy in the unfolded state, and pair-wise energy. Structures were only scored in the analysis with no additional relaxation or other modifications using the standard Rosetta scoring function. Only resi-

We recently reported using a combination of statistical, structure-based, and knowledge-based design methods (see Materials and Methods) to create focused libraries of mutant BHA10 scFvs with predicted improved stability (Miller et al., manuscript in preparation). The stability of the wild-type and mutant scFvs were evaluated using a thermal challenge and binding assay and 18 stabilizing mutants in 10 positions were identified (Supporting Information Table 2). The four most stabilizing mutations: VH S16E, VH V55G, VH P101D, and VL S46L were combined into double and quadruple mutants (Table I). To further characterize the observed stability differences, we compared the SEC (Supporting Information Figure 1) and equilibrium unfolding (Supporting Information Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively) profiles of the wild-type, double (VH S16E and VL S46L), and quadruple mutant Fabs. The apparent unfolding free energies derived from the guanidine denaturations indicate increased stability for both the double and quadruple mutant scFvs relative to the wild-type scFv (Table II). The observed m values for each of the scFvs (between 1 and 2 kcal mol21 M21) are similar to what has been observed for the unfolding of single domain proteins such as hen egg white lysozyme or ribonuclease A42, both close in size to a single Ig-domain, suggesting limited unfolding cooperativity among the four domains of the Fab. Within the quadruple mutant Fab, two separate transitions were observed. The apparent intermediate may represent the separate unfolding of different Fab domains with disparate unfolding free energies induced by the stabilizing mutations within the variable domains. Such multitransition unfolding curves have been observed in other Fabs and scFvs where the individual Ig-domains have significantly

reduced propensity for intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. Computational energy scoring analysis of VH S16E using Rosetta suggested an apparent increase in the attractive energy term of the Lennard-Jones potential of approximately 2 kcal/mol relative to the wild-type structure. This may be attributed to the increased van der Waals contacts formed by the mutant residue with a larger aliphatic side chain.

different folding free energies.43 These mutants retained binding to LTb receptor.7 To establish the molecular basis for the stabilization, we have solved high resolution crystal structures of wild-type, double, and quadruple mutants of BHA10 Fab. These highly stabilized mutants maintain overall structure with all atom RMS of 0.9 and ∞ 0.5 A for the wild-type and double mutant structures with respect to quadruple mutant. The detailed analysis of individual mutants is presented below (Fig. 1).
Implications of VH S16E

As shown in Figure 3, VH V55 is located in a turn region near CDR2 in the VH domain. In the wild-type molecule, V55 possesses highly unfavorable /-psi angles that strain this turn based on Rosetta energy scoring (Fig. 3 inset). Mutating to glycine removes steric repulsion of the VH N54 carbonyl and also increases favorable solvation energy of VH P52 and VH K74 as predicted by Rosetta. This solvation change is confirmed in the crystal structure as well; the quadruple mutant structure contains an additional water molecule associated with VH P52. Aggregation behavior as measured by SEC (see Supporting Information Figure 1) indicates that the quadruple mutant containing this change essentially forms no aggregate in solution. Although this may be attributed to the VH P101D mutation as well, one may postulate that the reduced surface hydrophobicity of the VH V55G mutation is a significant source of the observed reduction in aggregation. In addition, the HC V55G mutation removes the unfavorable /-psi strain on this turn. We further confirmed this prediction using VADAR,44 a computational tool for analyzing protein structures, which predicted the VH V55G stabilizing effect due to correction of a poor omega angle.

A large positive electrostatic charge density surrounds the region near VH S16 in the wild-type structure, as displayed in Figure 2(A). Mutation to glutamic acid alters the surface electrostatics significantly, as shown in Figure 2(B), significantly attenuating this large charge density. Although reduced net surface charge may potentially reduce molecular solubility, mutant and wild-type molecules were formulated at similar concentrations. Furthermore, replacing an uncharged polar serine with a charged glutamic acid increased surface hydrophilicity and

(B) Electrostatic surface representation of region highlighted in the ribbons structure showing a basic patch on wild-type BHA10 that is mostly neutralized in the quadruple mutant structure.

Although VH S16E and VH V55G are mutations isolated within the VH domain itself, VH P101D and VL S46L are at the Fv interface and must be evaluated together. Here, the primary electrostatic change that occurs is the introduction of a salt bridge between VH P101D and VH R98, as observed in Figure 4(A). As with VH S16E, VL S46L also increases van der Waals contacts due to the increased steric bulk. In both the double and quadruple mutant structures, the larger leucine residue has caused VL Y55 to adopt an alternate rotamer conformation. This rearrangement is displayed in Figure 4(A). Calculated Rosetta energy scores indicate that this alternate conformation is highly favorable, improving solvation energy of VL Y55 by 1.4 kcal/mol relative to the wild-type rotamer. In the absence of VH P101D, as in the double mutant, additional favorable energetic differences of approximately 1.5 kcal/mol for hydrogen bond energies exist in the surrounding region. This energetic gain is spread throughout the region and does not arise due to any one specific interaction. Inclusion of VH P101D in the quadruple mutant enhances the favorable hydrogen bond energy further, increasing the predicted stabilizing effect of mutation to 2.6 kcal/mol due to the formation of a salt bridge with VH R98. However, unfavorable rotamers for VL K45 are introduced in both the double and quadruple mutant structures (not shown), limiting the overall predicted stabilization relative to wild type to 2.9 kcal/mol. In addition to the alternate rotamer conformation of VL Y55, the key structural change resulting from these mutations is a flip in the peptide bond of VH W100 and E101 in the quadruple mutant, as displayed in Figure 4(A,B). Absence of this reorientation in the double mutant suggests that neither VL S46L nor the alternate conformation of VH Y55 is the cause of this rearrangement. Instead, the inclusion of VH P101D likely directs this change due to added loop strain by the newly formed salt bridge with VH R98 and steric repulsion of the proline ring. To further investigate this reorganization, we used Rosetta45,46 to generate the VH P101D mutant in silico on the same backbone as the wild type without VH W196 reorientation. In this conformation, unfavorable repulsive energies for VH R94, F99, and D101 are introduced (calculated as 1.2 kcal/mol total), as well as energetic solvation penalties for VH R94, D101, and Y102 (calculated as 2.4 kcal/mol total) as they have less contact with the solution in this orientation. This computational result suggests a mechanistic hypothesis for the reorientation and provides estimates of the magnitudes of the effects that are consistent with the experimentally observed stabilization.

Development of hierarchical mutant Rosetta design scoring approach

We have used computational scoring analysis of these three structures to identify the energetic contributions to the observed stabilization. Although VH V55 and VH S16 are solvent exposed and VH P101 is partially accessible to the solvent, the primary source of stabilization appears to be increased van der Waals interactions resulting from larger amino acids; the VH mutation site V55 is the exception. Additional stabilizing effects of electrostatics, solvation, and hydrogen bonding energy exist, as expected for solvent exposed residues participating in water-mediated hydrogen bonding networks. The best four mutations were identified based on covariation analysis, engineering to consensus, and knowledge-based design. We next sought to use molecular insights from this study to suggest additional stabilizing mutations based on Rosetta, the computational tool used in our energy scoring analysis. This software suite is

well documented in the literature, having recently achieved greatly enhanced protein stabilization41 and protein≠protein binding affinity,39 among other protein design accomplishments. Although these and similar published reports highlight the successes of Rosetta, few studies detail the rate of success for suggested mutants. Mutations in these and other studies selected for experimental design have been identified as favorable by Rosetta energy scores, but this value alone is likely not the only basis for design. Additional structure evaluation is often required to distinguish subtle differences in potentially favorable mutations. This process refines the mutant selection to an experimentally feasible number of structures. To demonstrate the need for additional scoring criteria, we tested a series of 29 mutants previously constructed based on covariation analysis, engineering to consensus, and knowledge-based design. Using Rosetta energy score as the only evaluation criteria, 64% of

mutations were predicted to increase stability (true positives) and 60% of stabilizing mutations were recovered (out of 15 possible). When an additional scoring filter based on molecular packing and solvent accessible surface area is added (Rosetta SASApack score must be less than the wild type) these values changed to 86% and 40%, respectively. Although fewer mutations are recovered with this additional filter, the significant increase in true positives is favorable from a practical design perspective. Recently, Sammond et al.47 suggested an improved protocol for enhanced protein-protein binding affinity. Their approach included an additional filter based on hydrogen bonding across the binding interface. We added a variation of this filter as a third level of scoring criteria for our test data set. For our filter, we required that hydrogen bond energy must be more favorable in the mutant than the wild type. The additional filter did not alter our results, and again the true positive and recovery rates were 86% and 40%, respectively. As the mutations presented in our current work are primarily surface exposed, we desired that additional mutations identified by our hierarchical approach would be based on changes within the solvent-protected core of the molecule. Consequently, we chose not to include a charge related or electrostatic filter to our scoring criteria. We expected the SASApack molecular packing filter to be quite useful based on the well-understood stabilizing effects of increased buried hydrophobic surface area.16,48 Additionally, mutations that are not surface

exposed will minimize effects of added hydrophobic surface area on protein solubility.
Applying Rosetta and the hierarchical filter to additional mutant design

Each residue in the VH and VL domains of the Fab ∞ greater than 4 A from a complimentary determining region was sequentially mutated to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. All structures were then evaluated based on Rosetta energy score and molecular packing score (SASApack). From the 1900 mutations that were considered, 15 had Rosetta energy scores greater than 0.95 kcal/mol stabilizing. Six of these structures also improved molecular packing within the molecule. We chose single substitution with the most improved molecular packing score, VH M80L and closely-related control mutant VH M80I for experimental design. The mutation identified in our hierarchical screen, VH M80L, resulted in 3.58C thermal challenge assay stabilization relative to that of the wild type. In contrast, the similar control VH M80I mutant that was not identified as stabilizing in our hierarchical screen and was destabilizing by 28C relative to the wild type (data not shown). We attribute the success of the stabilizing mutation M80L to the increased molecular packing and buried hydrophobic surface area. Notably, this new mutation was not identified during any of our previous design methods and provides a useful example of both applying

hierarchical approach to mutant design and using a number of computational methods to focus design on different regions of the molecule. CONCLUSIONS We have applied detailed structural and computational analyses to understand the molecular factors contributing to the stability on antibodies and antibody-like molecules and to design stabilized mutations in the scFv domain of an Ig-like bispecific antibody. We transformed these insights into a hierarchical structure-based mutant selection strategy using the stepwise evaluation of the components of the energy function of the molecular modeling program Rosetta. This new approach featuring multiple filter criteria, based on the patterns of hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bonding within antibody domains, enhanced our ability to identify stabilizing mutations and led to identification of new stabilizing mutation that was not detected by other design methods. This strategy provides a general means for identifying and assessing the value of stability altering mutations, which can be applied to the engineering of other antibody systems or multidomain proteins to enhance thermal and chemical stability leading to optimized manufacturing processes, minimal non-native aggregate formation, and extended product shelf life of therapeutic molecules.
