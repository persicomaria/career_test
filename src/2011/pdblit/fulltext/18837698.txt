CopR of Lactococcus lactis is a copper-responsive repressor involved in copper homoeostasis. It controls the expression of a total of 11 genes, the CopR regulon, in a copper-dependent manner. In the absence of copper, CopR binds to the promoters of the CopR regulon. Copper releases CopR from the promoters, allowing transcription of the downstream genes to proceed. CopR binds through its N-terminal domain to a `cop box' of consensus TACANNTGTA, which is conserved in Firmicutes. We have solved the NMR solution structure of the N-terminal DNA-

binding domain of CopR. The protein fold has a winged helix structure resembling that of the BlaI repressor which regulates antibiotic resistance in Bacillus licheniformis. CopR differs from other copper-responsive repressors, and the present structure represents a novel family of copper regulators, which we propose to call the CopY family. Key words: cop operon, copper homoeostasis, Lactococcus lactis, repressor, solution structure, winged helix.

INTRODUCTION

Metal ion homoeostasis serves to regulate available intracellular metal ions by controlling uptake, sequestration and secretion. In all organisms, metal homoeostasis involves regulation at the level of transcription. Metal-responsive transcriptional regulators bind metal ions and repress or activate the transcription of operons which encode metal ion transporters, metal reductases or oxidases, and cytoplasmic or periplasmic metal-sequestering proteins [1]. This ensures a proper balance of transition metal ions in the cell. Moreover, cells act in response to heavy metal pollutants that have no biological function, such as arsenic, mercury, cadmium, silver and lead, by using specialized transcriptional regulatory mechanisms [2­6]. Copper is an essential heavy metal involved in various cellular processes. It acts as a cofactor in enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase or superoxide dismutase. Although essential, copper is toxic when present in excess. In bacteria, a key mechanism for dealing with excess cytoplasmic copper is its extrusion by copper ATPases [7,8]. The expression of copper ATPases, as well as other copper homoeostatic proteins, is controlled by copper-responsive regulators. These regulators fall into two broad classes: twocomponent regulatory systems which are composed of a sensor kinase and a response regulator, and regulators which consist of a single protein species. CopR of Lactococcus lactis belongs to the latter and only this will be considered in the present paper. All structurally characterized single-component regulators involved in the control of gene expression by copper in bacteria belong to one of three families. These are, named by their founding members, the MerR, ArsR and CsoR families [1,9]. MerR- and ArsR-type proteins are `winged helix' proteins. Key members of the winged helix family are the liver-specific HNF-3 (hepatocyte nuclear factor-3) and Drosophila homoeotic forkhead proteins. Thus winged helix proteins are also referred to as HFH (HNF-3/forkhead) proteins (for a review, see [10]). Winged helix proteins in turn belong to the superfamily of helix­turn­

helix DNA-binding proteins. The DNA-binding domains of winged helix proteins are characterized by a compact core of three -helices, two of which form the helix­turn­helix motif, and a wing formed by an antiparallel -sheet hairpin [10]. MerR, the founding member of the MerR family of transcriptional regulators, induces transcription of mercury-resistance genes in response to mercury, but other members of the MerR family respond to a wide range of environmental stimuli, such as oxidative stress, other heavy metals or antibiotics. A MerRtype regulator, CueR, regulates the expression of the CopA copper efflux ATPase and the periplasmic CueO copper oxidase in Escherichia coli [11]. MerR-type regulators are dimeric winged helix proteins, and activation of transcription is achieved by distortion of the DNA upon binding of the effector to the protein [12]. The ArsR family of transcriptional regulators includes repressors for a wide range of heavy metals and metalloids, including arsenite and antimonite, which are the inducers of the ArsR founding member of the family [2]. Low inducer specificity may be a general property of ArsR-type regulators. The cadmiumresponsive repressor, CadC from a Staphylococcus aureus cadmium-resistance plasmid, is inducible by Cd2+ , Bi3+ and Pb2+ [13]. Similarly, BxmR of cyanobacteria was found to regulate the expression of a heavy-metal-transporting ATPase and a metallothionein in response to Cu+ , Ag+ , Cd2+ and Zn2+ [14]. ArsR-type regulators are also homodimers, but, in contrast with MerR-type regulators, transcription is induced by release of the repressor from the operator/promoter, rather than by distortion of the DNA. CsoR of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the sole characterized member of the corresponding new family of copper-responsive transcriptional regulators [15]. This repressor bears no resemblance to other characterized copper regulators and was found to have a novel DNA-binding fold, consisting of an antiparallel four-helix bundle [16]. Cu+ and Ag+ induce dissociation of the dimeric CsoR repressor from the DNA, thus allowing transcription to proceed [16]. Genes homologous with CsoR

are present in other bacterial species, but have so far not been characterized. Copper-responsive repressors apparently not belonging to any of the aforementioned families have been identified in Firmicutes. CopY of Enterococcus hirae, a close homologue of CopR of L. lactis used in the present study, has been investigated in detail [17­21]. CopY regulates the expression of the cop operon of E. hirae in response to copper and thereby controls copper homoeostasis. When the copper concentration is low, CopY is bound to the promoter as a zinc-containing dimer. When the cytoplasmic copper concentration rises, the CopZ copper chaperone transfers Cu+ to the CopY repressor, thereby displacing the bound Zn2+ . The exchange of one Zn2+ for two Cu+ per CopY monomer lowers the DNA-binding affinity of the repressor and allows transcription of the downstream genes to proceed. CopY binds to an inverted DNA repeat of consensus TACANNTGTA, called a `cop box'. Cop boxes and CopY-type repressors appear to be a general element of copper regulation in Firmicutes [22]. CopR of L. lactis also binds to cop boxes of consensus TACANNTGTA [21,22], and it can be assumed that the mechanism of release from DNA is analogous to that of CopY of E. hirae. A total of 11 genes have been found to be under the control of CopR [23]. These genes constitute the CopR regulon, which consists of four monocistronic genes, lctO, ytjD, copB and ydiD, and two polycistronic operons, yahCD­yaiAB and copRZA. Although only the function of the copRZA operon and the lctO gene have been investigated so far [23,24], it is clear that the CopR repressor fulfils an important role in copper homoeostasis, and probably defence against metal stress in general, in L. lactis. In the present study, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the CopR-DBD (DNA-binding domain of CopR) of L. lactis IL1403 using NMR. CopR was found to be a winged helix protein which does not belong to the ArsR or MerR families of winged helix proteins. Apparently, CopR represents a new family of copper-responsive transcriptional regulators and we present the first molecular structure of a member of this family, which we call the CopY family after its founding member, CopY of E. hirae.

of M9 minimal medium containing 50 g/ml ampicillin, 0.5 g/l NH4 SO4 and 2 g/l [13 C]glucose (99 %, Isotec). At a D600 of 0.3, cells were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl -Dthiogalactoside) for 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min, washed with an equal volume of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 300 mM NaCl. Cells were broken by three passages through a French press at 70 MPa. The cell debris was collected by centrifugation at 50 000 rev./min for 1 h using a Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor and the supernatant applied to a Ni-NTA (Ni2+ -nitrilotriacetate) Superflow (Qiagen) column. The column was washed with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8), 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, and CopR-DBD was eluted with the same buffer, but containing 200 mM imidazole. Ni-NTA columns were only used twice. To the eluted protein, 1/1000 vol. of protease inhibitor mixture (100 mM N--p-tosyl-L-lysylchloromethane, 100 mM N-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanylchloromethylketone, 100 mM p-aminobenzamidine and 100 mM PMSF dissolved in DMSO) was added and the protein was dialysed three times against 150 vol. of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl. CopR-DBD of five to six preparations was pooled and preconcentrated to approx. 0.1 mM by ultrafiltration with a YM3 membrane (Millipore) and concentrated further to  0.2 mM protein in a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience AG). Freezing of the protein was avoided throughout the procedure as it caused precipitation. The N-terminal His6 tag was removed with a 1/10 vol. of AcTEVTM protease (Invitrogen) for 3 h at room temperature (20 C). The cleaved tag, AcTEV protease and uncleaved CopR were removed from the preparation by renewed passage over an Ni-NTA column. Protein purity was checked on 15 % Tricine­ SDS/polyacrylamide gels [25].

NMR structural and dynamic characterization

MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals

Unless indicated otherwise, chemicals were from Sigma or Merck and were of analytical grade. Restriction enzymes were from Roche. TaqPlus® Long DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth.
Plasmids

Construction of the plasmid pLlcopyLT298, which expresses the His6 -tagged CopR-DBD, has been described previously [21,22]. CopR-DBD with the His6 tag was a protein of 99 amino acids, consisting of the 25 amino acid tag, MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGA, followed by the N-terminal 74 residues of CopR. AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) cleaved CopR-DBD after Gln23 , resulting in a 76 amino acid protein with GA added to the N-terminal methionine residue of CopR-DBD. Residue numbering was based on the uncleaved 99 amino acid CopR-DBD.
Protein purification

Holo-CopR was purified as described previously [22]. CopRDBD was purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene) containing plasmid pLlcopyLT298 by growing cells in 400 ml batches (larger cultures expressed less protein)

NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Avance 700 and 900 Bruker spectrometers, both equipped with cryogenically cooled probes. Resonance assignments of the CopR construct were performed by conventional multi-dimensional NMR techniques based on triple-resonance experiments (see Supplementary Table S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170493add.htm; [26]). Resonance assignments are reported in Supplementary Tables S2 (http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170493add.htm) and coordinates were deposited in the PDB (code 2K4B). Amide protons assignment was not achieved for the N- and C-terminal segments of CopR-DBD (residues 26­39, 41­42 and 98­99) or for Lys80 , Gly89 and Arg90 . Since the 25 amino acid tag is not part of the protein, it was not taken into consideration in the NMR analysis. Distance constraints for structure determination of the CopR construct were obtained from 15 N-edited and 13 Cedited three-dimensional NOESY­HSQC (heteronuclear singlequantum coherence) experiments (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/ 417/bj4170493add.htm). The dihedral  and angle restraints were derived with the TALOS program [27], using backbone chemical shift values. Structure calculations were performed using the CYANA program [28]. Each of the 20 conformers with the lowest residual CYANA target function value was then energy-minimized in explicit solvent with the program AMBER-8 [29]. NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) and torsion angle constraints were applied with force constants of 32 kcal · mol-1 · Å-2 (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ; 1 Å = 0.1 nm) and 32 kcal · mol-1 · rad-2 respectively. Supplementary Table S3 (http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170493add. htm) reports statistics on restraint violations in the final structure and structural quality parameters.

The dynamic properties of the CopR-DBD were sampled directly through 15 N relaxation measurements. 15 N longitudinal and traverse relaxation rates and 15 N{1 H}-NOEs [30,31] were recorded at 298 K at 700 MHz, on 0.2 mM CopR-DBD. R1 and R2 relaxation rates were obtained by fitting the crosspeak volumes, I, measured as a function of the relaxation delay, to a single exponential decay as described previously [32]. Uncertainties were evaluated by a Monte Carlo approach [32]. Heteronuclear NOE values were calculated as the ratio of peak volumes in spectra recorded with and without saturation. In all experiments, the water signal was suppressed with the `water flip-back' scheme [30,33]. The backbone 15 N longitudinal R1 and transversal R2 relaxation rates and 15 N{1 H}NOEs had average values of 1.1 + 0.2, 22.7 + 3.6 and 0.73 + - - - 0.04 s-1 .
RESULTS

We initially attempted to use the copper-responsive repressor, CopY, of E. hirae for structural characterization. However, this protein was not sufficiently soluble. We therefore cloned and expressed homologous repressors from Streptococcus mutans, Lactococcus sakei and L. lactis. The repressor from L. lactis was the most soluble of these proteins, but still not sufficiently soluble for NMR studies. However, CopR-DBD had a higher solubility, thus allowing us to obtain samples sufficiently concentrated for NMR structural work. The highest solubility ( 0.2 mM) of CopR-DBD was achieved in the presence of the His6 tag, which was therefore not removed for NMR experiments. Since no studies of metal-dependent structural changes were conducted, the presence of the (unstructured) His6 tag is unlikely to have affected any of the structural properties reported here. Purified CopR-DBD was in a dimeric state, as determined using analytical gel filtration (results not shown). Dynamic light scattering measured at the protein concentrations used for NMR analysis revealed the presence of 5­7 % higher-molecular-mass aggregates. Cleavage of the His6 tag did not significantly change the dispersity of CopR-DBD, even at lower protein concentrations (results not shown). The presence of a polydisperse fraction would suggest that the dimerization of CopR-DBD was non-specific. This notion is supported by the lack of a detectable change of the 1 H and 15 N chemical shifts for any residue as a function of concentration in the range 20­200 M. The dynamic and structural properties of the CopR-DBD construct were studied by NMR. The 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum of CopR-DBD, recorded at 298 K, showed only approx. 50 NH resonances. The amide protons of 36 amino acids at the Nand C-terminal regions were missed in the HSQC spectrum, but most of these were in the N-terminal 25 amino acid His6 tag extension. Also, the signals were generally broader than expected for a molecule of the size of CopR-DBD. From the heteronuclear 15 N relaxation data, measured at the relatively low concentration used for structural studies, a correlation time for protein tumbling of 12.7 + 0.6 ns was estimated. This value - corresponded to that expected for a CopR-DBD dimer. The R1 mean value of 1.1 + 0.2 s-1 , measured at 700 MHz, was also - consistent with the reorientation correlation time of CopR-DBD being in a dimeric state, whereas the R2 mean value of 22.7 + - 3.6 s-1 (Figure 1A) was slightly higher, indicating that exchange processes were taking place. The relaxation rates and 15 N{1 H}-NOEs were essentially homogeneous for all of the detected NH groups, and the absence of negative 15 N{1 H}-NOE values for this segment indicated that

The asterisks indicate conserved residues or conservative amino acid replacements. Amino acids which have been shown to interact with DNA in BlaI and MecI are underlined. The sequence of CopR which is not present in the structure shown here is italicized.

there were no regions experiencing extensive dynamics on the sub-nanosecond time scale, which would be typical of random coils. Only a few residues located in loop regions and in the -hairpin loop experienced some degree of internal mobility, as apparent from the higher R1 and lower 15 N{1 H}-NOEs values compared with the average (Figure 1A). In addition to these fast internal motions, slow conformational exchange processes were present in the -hairpin loop, as indicated by R2 values higher than average. Residues experiencing higher R2 values are also located in the loop connecting helices 2 and 3. The sample conditions used here (0.2 mM protein concentration, pH 7.5 and 298 K) were the only ones that allowed the recording of NMR spectra of sufficient quality to enable resonance assignment and structural determination. Changes to these conditions led to protein precipitation or to poorer quality of the spectra. Furthermore, line broadening induced by conformational processes led to a low number of long-range intramolecular NOEs. The intrinsic instability of the sample prevented us from performing NMR analysis at other temperatures and concentrations, which possibly would have provided spectra and structural data of higher information content.

difficulties, the structure of the CopR-DBD monomer could be solved at high resolution for amino acids 36­96 of the His6 tagged protein, corresponding to amino acids 11­71 in native CopR. A total of 750 meaningful upper distance limits and 94 angle constraints were used for structure calculations. After energy minimization, the final bundle of 20 conformers of CopR-DBD had an average target function of 0.8 Å2 (CYANA units) with no distance constraint violations above 0.30 Å (Supplementary Table S3). The average backbone RMSD (root mean square deviation) value, over residues 36­96 of the CopRDBD structure, was 0.70 + 0.13 Å (Supplementary Figure S2 at - http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170493add.htm). The CopR-DBD solution structure consists of a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet [residues 50 and 51 (1), 84­88 (2) and 91­95 (3)] packed against three -helices [residues 39­47 (1), 52­58 (2) and 68­79 (3)] arranged in the order 1-12-3-2-3 (Figure 2A).

DBD belongs to the family of winged helix proteins, which are characterized by a helix­turn­helix motif formed by helices 2 and 3. Strands 2 and 3 form an antiparallel -sheet, or wing, with a loop (Gly89 -Arg90 ) connecting them. This arrangement is found in many DNA-binding proteins [10]. In the present structure, the core of the protein is characterized by a number of hydrophobic interactions which stabilize the protein and involve both aliphatic and aromatic residues: Val40 , Val43 , Ile44 and Leu47 in 1, Ala50 in 1, Ile55 and Ile59 in 2, Leu63 , Trp65 and Leu67 in the loop between 2 and 3, Val70 , Leu74 and Leu77 in 3, and Leu83 in 2 and Tyr94 in 3. The sheet is positioned immediately after the DNA-recognition helix (3) and is anchored through the above-mentioned hydrophobic interactions to helices 2 and 3. All of these hydrophobic residues of CopR-DBD, with the exception of Leu47 , Leu63 and Leu67 , are conserved in BlaI of Bacillus licheniformis and MecI of S. aureus, which are two bacterial winged helix proteins sharing significant sequence similarity to CopR (Figure 1B) [34­36]. Two regions on the protein surface are particularly rich in charged residues (Figure 2C). The first one is the solvent-exposed face of the -sheet where both negatively and positively charged residues are present. The other region involves three positively charged residues (Arg76 , Lys79 and Lys80 ) located in the C-terminal side of the DNA-recognition helix. These residues, which were shown previously to be involved in the interaction with DNA [34,37], are conserved between BlaI, MecI and CopR. Comparison of CopR-DBD with the DNA-binding domain of BlaI from B. licheniformis reveals that the largest structural difference between the two proteins is in helix 2, which is shorter at the C-terminus in CopR-DBD compared with BlaI (Figure 3). This is due to the presence of Pro60 in CopR-DBD, which is absent from BlaI.

CopR repressor structure DISCUSSION

497

In the present study, we have solved the structure of the CopRDBD of L. lactis. On the basis of this structure, CopR belongs to the family of winged helix proteins. The DNA-binding domains of winged helix proteins are characterized by a compact core of three -helices and a wing formed by an antiparallel -sheet hairpin [10]. DNA is primarily bound between an -helix of the core, also termed the recognition helix, and the wing, but additional DNA-binding elements may be present. The order of structural elements of the winged helix core along the polypeptide chain differs between different families of winged helix proteins. In CopR, the N-terminal helix­turn­helix motif is followed by helix 3, which appears to be the DNA-recognition helix, which is followed by a wing consisting of an antiparallel -hairpin. Positively charged residues clustered in the groove formed by helix 3 and the wing appear to form the DNA-binding groove (indicated in blue in Figure 2C). The CopR-DBD exhibits 55 and 52 % amino acid similarity to the corresponding domains of BlaI and MecI respectively, and the sequences align without gaps. This suggests not only closely similar structures, but also closely similar modes of interaction with DNA. The amino acids affected by DNA binding have been determined for BlaI and MecI by NMR chemical shift comparison between the free and the DNA-bound forms [34,35]. The residues proposed to interact with DNA in the BlaI and MecI proteins are largely conserved in CopR (Figure 1B, underlined). Surprisingly, BlaI, MecI and related repressors bind to the same consensus DNA-binding motif, TACANNTGTA, as CopR and other CopY-type repressors [21,23,35]. The binding of these different repressors to the same consensus sequence is striking and underlines the structural similarity of the DNA-binding domains of these proteins. CopY of E. hirae binds to the cop box as a dimer, with each monomer presumably occupying one half of the symmetrical dyad [18]. The DNA sequence requirement for this interaction was found to be very stringent. Mutation of one dyad of the cop box from TACA to TTCA reduced the DNA-binding affinity of CopY sufficiently to make the promoter hyperinducible by copper [17]. Both the structure of the CopR-DBD and the mechanism of transcriptional control by CopR differ significantly from MerR, ArsR or CsoR family members. In CueR of Escherichia coli, a member of the MerR family of winged helix proteins, three N-terminal -helices form the helix core and are followed by the wing, which in turn is followed by a second helix­turn­ helix motif [11]. The loop between helices 2 and 3 is shorter in CueR than in CopR [11]. Thus, when the 2 helices of the two proteins are superimposed, the 3 helices point in opposite directions. Consequently, the -hairpins of the two structures occupy different regions in space. In CueR and other MerR-type regulators, a long ten-turn -helix following the DNA-binding domain is involved in dimerization by forming an antiparallel coiled coil with the equivalent helix of the other subunit [38]. This dimerization mechanism is a unique feature of MerR-type regulators. A second unique feature of these regulators is the activation of transcription by distortion of the bound operator/promoter DNA, rather than by release from the DNA, as is the case for other types of transcriptional regulators [12]. Other bacterial copper regulators, such as BxmR of cyanobacteria, belongs to the ArsR family. Members of the ArsR family possess winged helix DNA-binding domains which resemble those of MerR-type regulators, but the dimerization domains differ and are constituted by two or three -helices. ArsR-type repressors bind to an imperfect 12-2-12 inverted repeat and

induction of transcription proceeds not by distortion of the DNA as in MerR-type regulators, but by a change in the affinity for the operator/promoter: the affinity for DNA is high in the metal free apo-form, but is lowered by the sequestration of the inducer. This allows the repressor to dissociation from the DNA, thereby activating transcription [1]. The copper-dependent repressor CsoR of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the sole characterized member of a third family of copper-responsive transcriptional regulators. The DNA-binding domain of CsoR is not a winged helix structure. Rather, it consists of a homodimeric antiparallel four-helix bundle [16]. Like repressors of the ArsR family, CsoR binds to the operator/ promoter in the metal-free apo-form and is released from the DNA upon binding of Cu+ . CopR clearly differs from all these metal-responsive transcriptional regulators in both structural and mechanistic regards, and thus belongs to a new family of transcriptional regulators. We like to call this family `CopY-type repressors', after the first identified member of the family, CopY of E. hirae. When the CopR-DBD structure is superimposed on the structure of the cadmium-sensing CmtR from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [39], which belongs to the ArsR/SmtB-like DNAbinding repressors, it is apparent that CmtR exhibits a structure similar to that of CopR-DBD, including the standard helix­ turn­helix motif and the -hairpin forming the wing. However, CmtR lacks the short -strand 1, which is part of the threestranded antiparallel -sheet present in CopR. In addition, the loop connecting 2 and 3 is shorter in CmtR than in CopRDBD. These differences appear to be responsible for the slightly different relative orientations of the -hairpins with respect to the recognition helices of the two proteins. Aside from the overall DNA-binding structure maintained in all the winged helix proteins, CmtR also contains two additional helices at the N- and C- termini. These helices define the interface between the two subunits of the CmtR dimer. In CmtR, the metal-binding domains are formed by residues located in the DNA-recognition helix of one subunit and residues in the C-terminal region of the other subunit. This feature is not preserved in CopR, which has a metalbinding site located in a C-terminal structural domain which is apparently not involved in DNA binding. It was reported previously that apo-CmtR was able to bind DNA and maintain the same overall fold as the cadmiumcontaining form. However, it was in a flexible state and lacked a well-defined dimer organization. Binding of cadmium to CmtR reduced the conformational heterogeneity and locked the two subunits into a more rigid structure. This structural transition upon cadmium binding could play an important role in weakening DNA association by excluding a subset of conformers with increased DNA-binding affinity [39]. The present CopR-DBD structure does not exhibit extensive fast internal motions or slow conformational exchange processes except for a few residues in the loop between 2 and 3 and in the -hairpin loop. This suggests different mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by CopR and CmtR. In CopR, factors other than dynamic properties appear to modulate DNA-binding affinity. CopR contains one bound zinc per monomer in the uninduced state, and induction proceeds by exchange of one Zn2+ for two Cu+ [20]. The metallation of CopR in the uninduced as well as the induced state point to a unique induction mechanism which deserves further study. Although regulators of antibiotic resistance such as BlaI or MecI feature a DNA-binding domain closely similar to that of CopR, their mode of activation by inducers is entirely different. The repressors are bipartite structures: the N-terminal halves of the molecules are involved in DNA binding, while the C-terminal halves harbour the induction mechanism. BlaI and

MecI induce transcription of -lactamase genes in response to -lactam antibiotics. Activation of transcription occurs by cleavage of the C-terminal dimerization domain between Asn100 and Phe101 in BlaI, and between Asn101 and Phe102 in MecI [35,40,41]. This cleavage impedes dimerization and dramatically lowers the DNA-binding affinity. Activation of CopR presumably proceeds by monomerization of the repressor dimer, as is the case for CopY of E. hirae [20,42]. The extended C-terminus of CopR features the metal-binding motif CXCX6 CXC. Unlike other known copper-responsive regulators, CopR and related repressors contain zinc in the native uninduced state [22]. The Zn2+ is bound to the CXCX6 CXC metal-binding motif. Upon induction, two Cu+ replaced the Zn2+ and destabilized the repressor dimer, thereby lowering the affinity for DNA [19,20,42,43]. Copper is co-ordinated in a very stable solvent-shielded Cu+ 2 ­S4 binuclear cluster [20]. This mode of activation is a unique feature of CopYtype repressors. Interestingly, the dimerization domains of BlaI and MecI (around amino acids 102­123) appear to be conserved in CopR and it will be interesting to see how copper binding to the C-terminus of CopR impedes dimerization, which obviously involves a different mechanism than in BlaI or MecI. Taken together, our findings show that the CopR-DBD of L. lactis is a winged helix structure, closely similar to those found in BlaI, MecI and related regulators. No other copper-responsive repressor with such a structure has so far been characterized, and the present structure defines the DNA-binding domain of a new family of CopY-type winged helix copper sensors.

* These experiments were acquired on a 900 MHz spectrometer  These experiments were acquired with mixing time of 100 ms.  Data acquired on 700 MHz spectrometer with a recycle delay of 3 s for R1 and R2 and 6 s for steady-state heteronuclear NOEs. All of the triple-resonance (TXI 5-mm) cryo-probes used were equipped with pulsed-field gradients along the z -axis. In R1 , R2 and heteronuclear NOE experiments, the water signal was suppressed with the `water flip-back' scheme. R2 rates were measured using a refocusing time of 450 s. All three- and two-dimensional spectra were processed using the standard Bruker software (TOPSPIN) and analysed through the CARA (Computer Aided Resonance Assignment) program developed at ETH-Zurich.

CopR repressor structure
Table S3 Statistical analysis of the energy-minimized structures of CopR-DBD

Structure calculations were performed with the program CYANA 2.1 [7). A total of 400 random conformers were subjected to 12 000 steps of a simulated annealing process. Each member of the ° family was submitted to restrained energy minimization (REM in explicit solvent) with the Amber-9 package [1]. Values of 32 kcal · mol-1 · A-2 and 32 kcal · mol-1 · rad-2 were used as force constants for the NOE and torsion angle restraints respectively. The data are calculated over the 20 conformers representing the NMR structure. Results are means + S.D.

* Number of meaningful constraints for each class. and  torsion angles and the dihedral  and angle restraints were derived with the TALOS program [3] and added as restraints in the structure calculations as well.  Calculated on residues 40­96.  As it results from the Ramachandran plot analysis performed using PROCHECK [9]. § These values have been obtained through WHAT IF analysis. A Z -score is defined as the deviation from the average value for this indicator observed in a database of high-resolution crystal structures, expressed in units of the S.D. of this database-derived average. Typically, Z -scores below - 3 are considered poor, those below - 4 are considered bad [11]. These values should be close to 1.0.
