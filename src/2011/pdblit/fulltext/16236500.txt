Synthesis and SAR are described for a structurally distinct class of DPP­IV inhibitors based on aminobenzo[a]quinolizines bearing (hetero-)aromatic substituents in the S1 specificity pocket. The m-(fluoromethyl)-phenyl derivative (S,S,S)-2g possesses the best fit in the S1 pocket. However, (S,S,S)-2i, bearing a more hydrophilic 5-methyl-pyridin-2-yl residue as substituent for the S1 pocket, displays excellent in vivo activity and superior drug-like properties.

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP­IV) inhibitors have emerged as a new therapeutic option to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.1,2 The pharmacological action is based mainly on the ability to prevent cleavage and inactivation of glucagon-like peptide (GLP­1), an incretin hormone which stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion. Several DPP­IV inhibitors have advanced into late stage clinical studies.2­4 Of these, sitagliptin5 (1a, Fig. 1), vildagliptin6 and saxagliptin7 have been approved and launched in several countries. While DPP­IV inhibitors encompass a remarkable structural diversity, with a primary or secondary amino group being the sole recurring motif, they all possess substituents which are able to occupy the S1 specificity pocket of the target. For instance, the trifluorophenyl subunit of 1a fully occupies the S1 pocket of DPP­IV. We have recently reported the discovery of aryl-substituted aminobenzo[a]quinolizines 2a­c (Fig. 1), a structurally distinct class of DPP­IV inhibitors.8 These inhibitors were derived from high-throughput screening hit 3, a legacy compound with favourable molecular properties, which was synthesised in the 1950s as one member of a series of emetine analogues. X-ray structural information was used together with structure-activity relationships obtained for simplified 1,3-substituted 4-aminopiperidines

and aminomethyl-pyrimidines9 such as 4a as the key elements in the lead identification process culminating in 2b and 2c, the first highly potent representatives of this class. Like 1a and 4a, 2b and 2c possess a substituted benzene ring as ligand for the S1 pocket. Here, we report the further evolution of the class culminating in (S,S,S)-2i, a highly potent compound with a more balanced profile. Having established that a lipophilic substituent at the meta-position of the aromatic ring (R1 in compound 2) brings about a significant improvement in activity by occupying the lipophilic niche

at the back of the S1 specificity pocket, we sought to explore alternative substituents on the aromatic ring. Also, there is room at the aromatic position para to R1 (substituent X in compound 2, Scheme 1) that could be occupied, either by a lipophilic substituent or by a heteroatom. Therefore, we synthesised a set of aryl- and heteroaryl derivatives of the general formula 2 according to Scheme 1.10 Thus, tricyclic ketone 511 was regio- and diastereoselectively arylated with halides 6 under palladium catalysis,12 affording only the 3b,11bb­stereoisomer 7. Conversion of the keto group of 7 to the oxime followed by reduction produced mixtures of the 2a and 2b amine epimers in a ratio of ca 8:1. The 2a­aminobenzo[a]quinolizines 2a­j were separated from the less active 2b­epimers8 by column chromatography. The activities of 2a­j as DPP­IV inhibitors are summarised in Table 1. As anticipated from the rigid nature of the S1 specificity pocket, the structure-activity relationship at R1 is rather steep. A chlorine atom or methyl group improve the activity by 40­50-fold (2b, c vs 2a).8 However, the advantage over the unsubstituted phenyl residue in 2a is partly lost when R1 is a slightly larger alkyl group [ethyl (2d), cyclopropyl (2c)]. Even larger R1 groups, such as isopropyl (2f), are not tolerated at all. On the other hand, one order of magnitude improvement in activity over 2c is gained by addition of a single fluorine atom (2g). Introduction of a methyl group at position X leads to a slight improvement in activity (ca two-fold for 2,5-dimethylphenyl derivative 2h). This effect is significant but smaller than that observed for electronegative groups like the ortho-chlorine in 4a9 (140-fold improvement over 4b) or for the ortho-fluorine in 1a (seven-fold improvement over 1b)5 which benefit from a favourable electrostatic interaction with the positively charged side chain of Arg125.13 The polar environment afforded by the side chains of Arg125 and Asn710 also tolerates the incorporation of an ortho-pyridine. In fact, the pyridine derivatives 2i and 2j are only slightly less active than the benzene counterparts 2c and 2g although they are around one order of magnitude less lipophilic. We were able to solve the X-ray complex structure of the fluoromethyl-substituted inhibitor 2g bound to human DPP­IV to a resolution of 2.8 Å (Fig. 2). The binding mode of the aminobenzo[a]quinolizine subunit is nearly identical to that of the HTS hit 1,13,16 in that the aromatic ring makes a favourable, parallel-shifted p­p interaction with Phe357, and the positively charged amino group is engaged in a tight H-bonding network with Glu205, Glu206, and Tyr662. The hydrophobic S1 pocket is fully occupied by the (fluoromethyl)-benzene moiety of 2g. In particular, the CH2F group nicely fits the asymmetry of the S1 pocket, with five van der Waals contacts to the side chains of Tyr631, Val656, Trp659, and Tyr666. The van der Waals interaction strength for the fluorine is about twice that of the hydrogen, thus rationalising the affinity improvement of 2g in comparison with 2c. Compound 2c is a highly potent compound with a favourable set of drug-like properties. It is highly soluble and permeable, metabolically stable, and has only a minimal potential for drug­drug interaction. In vivo, it is active at an oral dose of 0.3 mg kgÀ1 in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats, reducing glucose levels by 41% at a time-point of 40 min after the glucose challenge.8 On the downside, in vivo clearance and vol-

ume of distribution are very high (Table 2), and brain uptake is extensive, which is not a desirable property for a compound

In summary, the X-ray structure of DPP­IV suggested that potency and molecular properties in the aryl-aminobenzo[a]quinolizine series can be modulated through optimisation of the S1 substituent. Compound (S,S,S)-2g, bearing a meta-(fluoromethyl)phenyl subunit, has the best fit in the S1 pocket. However, improved drug-like properties were obtained by installing a more polar pyridine ring in the S1 ligand position, leading to (S,S,S)-2i, a highly potent DPP­IV inhibitor with more balanced properties.

intended for a peripheral mode-of-action. Finally, 2c strongly induces phospholipidosis in cultured fibroblasts15 at the lowest tested concentration of 2.5 lM. A proven strategy to reduce the risk of phospholipidosis is to minimise the free energy of amphiphilicity, DDGam.18,19 Indeed, the pyridine analogue 2i (DDGam = -6.02 kJ molÀ1) is significantly less amphiphilic than 2c (DDGam = -6.41 kJ molÀ1). Accordingly, the lowest concentration of 2i to induce phospholipidosis in vitro is 15 lM. Fluorine substitution on the pyridine methyl of 2i enhances the potency further (2j), but this compound unfortunately tested positive in the Ames test for mutagenicity20 and in the micronucleus test for clastogenicity21 and was thus not considered further. The racemate 2i was separated into its enantiomers using chiral HPLC (ChiralpakÒ AD). The (S,S,S)-enantiomer is potent (IC50 = 11 nM), whereas the (R,R,R)-enantiomer is virtually inactive (IC50 = 53,000 nM). In comparison with lead compound 2c, (S,S,S)-2i exhibits superior pharmacokinetic properties, having a lower volume of distribution, less brain penetration, and a shorter half life (Table 2). In vivo, (S,S,S)-2i reduces glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Indeed, the compound already shows appreciable glucose reduction at a dose as low as 0.03 mg kgÀ1.
