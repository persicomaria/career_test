Inhibition of the VEGF signaling pathway has become a valuable approach in the treatment of cancers. Guided by X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling, a series of 2-aminobenzimidazoles and 2-aminobenzoxazoles were identified as potent inhibitors of VEGFR-2 (KDR) in both enzymatic and HUVEC cellular proliferation assays. In this report we describe the synthesis and structure-activity relationship of a series of 2-aminobenzimidazoles and benzoxazoles, culminating in the identification of benzoxazole 22 as a potent and selective VEGFR-2 inhibitor displaying a good pharmacokinetic profile. Compound 22 demonstrated efficacy in both the murine matrigel model for vascular permeability (79% inhibition observed at 100 mg/kg) and the rat corneal angiogenesis model (ED50 ) 16.3 mg/kg).
Introduction Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature, is a normal physiological event that occurs during embryonic growth, wound healing and the menstrual cycle. Abnormal regulation of angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders including diabetic retinopathy,1 rheumatoid arthritis,2 age-related macular degeneration,3 and cancer.4,5 As angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and metastasis, the concept of limiting the growth of a solid tumor by restricting the blood supply has been evaluated in human cancer and has proven successful.6 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFa) is a known promoter of angiogenesis, and the increased expression of VEGF has been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis.4,5 VEGF signaling through its receptor tyrosine kinase VEGFR-2 (or KDR, kinase insert domain receptor) promotes several events required for the formation of new blood vessels, such as endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration, and vascular permeability. Inhibition of the VEGF signaling pathway has become a valuable approach in the treatment of cancers. For example, the use of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody to VEGF, bevacizumab (Genentech), has demonstrated a prolonged survival in colorectal cancer patients.7 The compounds in Figure 1 represent the structural diversity of small molecule, ATPcompetitive, KDR inhibitors under clinical investigation. In particular, sunitinib (SU-11248)8 and sorafenib (Bay 43-9006, 2;9 a dual raf-KDR inhibitor) have recently been approved for the treatment of cancers.10

Our independent medicinal chemistry efforts in finding a selective VEGFR inhibitor led to motesanib diphosphate (AMG 706, 1), currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers.10e We were also interested in identifying a second generation of KDR inhibitor belonging to a completely different structural class from the nicotinamide. Urea 2 was originally described solely as a raf inhibitor, however, we serendipitously discovered that it inhibited KDR as well, with a Ki of 2 nM.11 As a means to understand the binding mode and generate a new chemotype for KDR inhibition, we docked 2 into the cocrystal structure of 1 and KDR12 to identify the key interactions between this molecule and the protein. One of the key features of the cocrystal structure of 1 bound KDR is the reorganization of Phe 1047 (of the Asp 1046, Phe 1047, Gly 1048 triad, the "DFG" motif) to induce the inactive "DFGout" conformation, similar to that observed upon binding of imatinib to its target kinase Abl.13 This conformational change inhibits the ability of the kinase to bind ATP productively and accommodates the binding of an appropriately substituted inhibitor into an extended lipophilic pocket. On the basis of the presumed cis-conformation of the urea moiety and the size of the terminal aryl group, we reasoned that 2 would also bind KDR in a DFG-out fashion. The docking of 2 in the crystal structure of 1 bound to KDR is depicted in Figure 2. The pyridine ring of 2 is positioned to overlay with the 4-aminomethylpyridine moiety of the nicotinamide to satisfy the critical interaction between the ring nitrogens and the Cys 919-NH in the kinase hinge region. This positioning also allows the amide-NH of 2 to engage in a second hydrogen bond with the backbone amide-CO of Cys 919. The biaryl-ether linkage projects the substituted phenyl ring into the lipophilic pocket neighboring the ATP binding site, adjacent to the gatekeeper residue, Val 916. This portion of 2 overlays well with the nicotinamide moiety. Further, this model places the urea carbonyl and its internal NH within hydrogen bond distances to the backbone of Asp 1046 and side chain of Glu 885, respectively, similar to the amide of 1. The preferred cisconformation of the urea places terminal aryl of 2 in a second

lipophilic pocket created by the movement of Phe 1047, similarly placed as the 3,3-dimethylindoline portion of the nicotinamide. Based on the above model, we proposed the cyclization of 2 to the corresponding 2-aminobenzimidazole to enhance conformational rigidity while maintaining the key hydrogen-bonding interactions. Reduced flexibility is expected to improve potency and oral bioavailablity.14 To test this hypothesis, compound 315 was prepared and found to be a potent KDR enzyme inhibitor, with a Ki of 9 nM (Figure

3). The cellular activity was assessed by measuring the inhibition of VEGF-stimulated cellular proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Surprisingly, lead compound 3 exhibited weak cellular activity (IC50 g 1140 nM). Guided by structural information, we varied the three main components of compound 3 (aniline ring, heterocyclic core, and hinge binding element) to improve the cellular potency. Herein, we describe the synthesis, structure-activity relationship, and pharmacological characterization of this new class of KDR inhibitors, which culminated in the identification of a potent, selective, and orally active 2-aminobenzoxazole 22 that demonstrated suppression of capillary formation in a rat-corneal model of angiogenesis. Chemistry The benzo-1,3-azoles described in this paper were prepared according to the general method represented in Scheme 1. Benzimidazoles 3-19 were prepared in a two-step, one-pot protocol by treatment of bis-anilines 39a-i with isothiocyanates

40 to afford thiourea intermediates that were directly cyclized to the desired products employing 1-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC). In a sequence similar to that used to prepare the benzimidazoles, treatment of amino-phenols 39j-t with thioisocyanates 40 and direct cyclization of the urea intermediates with EDC afforded the benzoxazoles 20-38 in good yields. The thiourea intermediates were not isolated, but rather cyclized directly to the desired core structure in situ. This convergent route allowed for rapid analoging of the 2-aniline moiety, as each variation could be introduced by simply employing the corresponding thioisocyanate. The anilines required for the synthesis of the arylthioisocyanates 40 were prepared via one of the methods described in Schemes 2 and 3. Compounds containing an ether-linked tether to the amino group were synthesized from the corresponding nitro anisole 41. Demethylation of 41 using strongly acidic conditions afforded phenols 42 with excellent yields. Compounds 43 were prepared by either a Mitsunobu etherification or alkylation of the phenol with generally high yields. Reduction of the nitro groups using either SnCl2 or catalytic hydrogenation afforded anilines 44a-d. Alternatively, anilines 46 containing an all-carbon tether to the amino group were prepared from 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzaldehyde in two steps. Reductive amination of the benzaldehyde with the appropriate amine afforded intermediate 45. Reduction of the nitro arenes with SnCl2-generated anilines 46 in good yields.

Anilines containing the N-methylpyrrolidine amino group were prepared using a variation to the chemistry described above (Scheme 3). Etherification of the phenols 42 with the N-Bocpyrrolidinol using Mitsunobu conditions afforded the nitro intermediates 47 with good yields. Compounds 47 were deprotected using TFA and the free amine subjected to reductive amination conditions to yield compounds 49 in good yields. Subsequent reduction of the nitro groups to the corresponding anilines (using either catalytic hydrogenation for the perfluorinated compounds or SnCl2 for the halogenated compound) afforded compounds 50 in excellent yields. Some arylthioisocyanates were commercially available, however, the remaining were prepared from condensation of the corresponding aniline with 1,1-thiocarbonyldiimidazole (Scheme 4). Intermediates 40 were either purified before use or used crude in the cyclization sequence (as a 1:2 mixture with imidazole). The phenylene diamines 39a-h, required for the synthesis of benzimidazoles 3-18 described in Tables 1-3, were prepared according to the generic route shown in Scheme 5. The substitution reactions of 3,4-dinitro phenol with the chlorinated heterocycles 51 afforded the biarylether 52.16 Subsequent reduction of the nitro groups using either catalytic hydrogenation or zinc dust afforded the desired phenylene diamines 39a-h in good to excellent yields. Scheme 6 depicts the synthesis of the N-methylphenylene diamine 39i, a precursor to N-methylbenzimidazole 19 (Table 4). The substitution reaction of the 4-chloropyridine carboxamide 53 with 4-amino-3-nitro phenol afforded aniline 54. Regioselective monomethylation was achieved in a one-pot procedure by employing in situ protection of the amine with the trifluoroacetate group, followed by methylation with dimethyl sulfate to afford compound 55 in excellent yield.

group of 55, achieved using SnCl2, then yielded the desired monomethylated bisaniline 39i. The amino phenol moieties required for the synthesis of 2-aminobenzoxazoles 20-38 described in Tables 4-6 were prepared according to the method described in Scheme 7. Chlorinated nitrogen-containing heterocycles 51 were treated with the preformed sodium phenolate of a 4-benzyloxyphenol to yield biarylethers 57 in generally good yields. Debenzylation of 57 was accomplished using either catalytic hydrogenation or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; depending on the substrate) to give corresponding phenols 58. The benzyl groups of compounds 57c and 57d (R1 ) Cl; heterocycle ) quinoline and pyridine carboxamide, respectively) were removed under the TFA conditions. Regioselective nitration of phenols 58 using nitric acid afforded compounds 59 in good yields. Reduction of the nitro groups yielding amino phenols 39j-t proceeded in generally excellent yields. Structural Information on Lead Compound 3. A crystal structure of 3 bound to KDR (Figure 4) confirmed the proposed binding mode and allowed us to use structural information to guide our medicinal chemistry efforts. As shown in Figure 4, compound 3 binds largely as predicted based on our model of compound 2 within the AMG 706/KDR structure. Hydrogen bonds between the hinge-region Cys 919 are observed with both the nitrogen of the pyridine and the carboxamide-NH. The benzimidazole core is oriented in the hydrophobic pocket flanked by Val 917. The endocyclic nitrogen of the benzimidazole hydrogen bonds with the NH of Asp 1046 and either the exocyclic or the endocyclic NH may interact with the side chain of Glu 885. Also consistent with the modeling studies, the aniline aryl ring occupies the second hydrophobic pocket

All compounds depicted in Tables 1-6 were screened for inhibition of KDR tyrosine kinase activity with select compounds further assayed in the HUVEC cellular assay. Our initial work focused on exploring variants to the pyridine carboxamide moiety of the 2-aminobenzimidazole 3 (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, removal of the carboxamide group (4 vs 3) led to an 18-fold reduction in enzyme potency, presumably due to the loss of the hydrogen-bond interaction between the NH of the carboxamide and the carbonyl of Cys 919. By incorporating nitrogen-containing heterocycles with a hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor appropriately spaced to interact with the hinge greater potency was realized. For example, quinazoline 5 (with the proton of C8 engaged in a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Cys 919)17 and azaindole-substituted 6 showed improved enzyme potency by 20-fold and 3-fold, respectively, compared to pyridine 4. Compound 5 displayed improved potency in the cellular assay (IC50 ) 49 nM), however, this was insufficient for advancement of this compound. Although 3 and 6 exhibited modest to good enzyme potencies, they lacked the desired activity in the HUVEC cellular proliferation assay. In an effort to improve the solubility and potentially improve cellular potency of the 2-aminobenzimidazoles, analogs containing a basic amine were investigated (Table 2). Guided by the structural information, we attached the amine from the 3-position of the phenyl ring with a 2- to 4-atom tether to direct the group toward bulk solvent. As exemplified by compound 7, no significant change was observed at the enzyme level compared to parent compound 3, however, the enzyme to cellular shift was 36-fold, resulting in a cellular potency of 146 nM. As shown by compounds 7-10, varying the amino moiety (e.g., acyclic vs cyclic), the tether linkage (e.g., O-linked vs C-linked), and the group at the 4-position (e.g., Cl vs CF3, vs C2H5) resulted in relatively small differences in the cellular potencies, with enzyme-to-cell shifts ranging from 10- to 40-fold. Other aniline substitution patterns (i.e., 3,5-substituted, 11) proved suboptimal for potency.

Encouraged by the improved cellular potency of compounds 7-10 compared to the parent compound 3, we investigated the effect of substituting the pyridine carboxamide with other nitrogen-containing heterocycles (Table 3). Consistent with previous observations (i.e., quinazoline 5, Table 1), compounds 12-14 containing the quinoline moiety were more potent at the cellular levels than the analogs bearing a pyrrolopyrimidine (15), an azaindole (16), or a 2-aminopyrimidine (17). The

improved potency observed with quinoline derivatives 12-14 reflected a slight decrease in enzyme-to-cell shift. Modifying either the bicyclic pyrollopyrimidine 15 or the azaindole 16 to the monocylic 2-aminopyridine 17 resulted in a loss of potency at the enzyme and cellular level. Although this is consistent with data in other series (ex: benzoxazole series (vide infra) and unpublished results), it could not be rationalized by structural information. As anticipated based on earlier studies, removal of the hydrogen-bond donor to the hinge region resulted in a 3-fold decline in enzyme potency (17 vs 18). The 2-aminobenzimidazole 14, containing a 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline moiety, displayed the best overall potency with a 10-fold increase in enzyme affinity (Ki ) 0.2 nM) compared to the

unsubstituted quinoline 13 (Ki ) 2 nM). This improved enzyme potency could result from an increased donor character of the C8-hydrogen of the 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline moiety binding the hinge region. In addition, compound 14 displayed an IC50 of 17 nM in the HUVEC assay. Although cellular efficacy was greatly improved by adding a tertiary amino group and varying the nitrogen-containing heterocycle, the shift between enzyme potency and cellular potency was difficult to predict and often greater than 10-fold. The crystal structure of 3 bound to KDR illustrates the hydrogen bond between either the exocyclic or the endocyclic NH of the benzimidazole and the side chain of Glu 885. To evaluate the possibility of removing the endocyclic hydrogenbond donor, we methylated the benzimidazole core. Indeed, the N-methylbenzimidazole 19 provided a Ki of 10 nM on phosphorylated KDR and an IC50 of 31 nM in the cellular assay, exhibiting only a 3-fold enzyme-to-cell shift (compared to the 36-fold shift observed with the parent compound 7; Table 4). This result indicates that a possible hydrogen bond between the endocyclic NH and the Glu 885 can be removed due to an interaction between Glu 885 and the exocyclic NH. Encouraged by this data, we altered the aminobenzimidazole core to a 2-aminobenzoxazole, as exemplified by compound 20. Compound 20 displayed good potency at the enzyme (Ki ) 4 nM) and cellular (IC50 ) 36 nM) levels. Based on this finding, we elected to investigate other structural variants in the 2-aminobenzoxazole series. The overall structure-activity relationship of the 2-aminobenzoxazoles followed a similar pattern as that of the corresponding 2-aminobenzimidazoles (Tables 5 and 6). As observed in the 2-aminobenzimidazole series, addition of a pendant basic amine was preferred to achieve good cellular

potency (Table 5). For example, simply substituted 21 exhibited a Ki of 12 nM in the enzyme assay, but displayed an IC50 of 766 nM in the cellular assay. Appendage of a basic amine (20) improved the enzyme potency 3-fold (Ki ) 4 nM), with a 20fold improvement in cellular potency (IC50 ) 36 nM). A brief examination of tertiary amine substituents indicated a variety of groups are tolerated (22-26). In particular, compounds containing an N-methylpyrrolidine (22), an N,N-diethylaminoethyl (24), or an N-methylpiperazine (20) substituent are optimum for achieving good cellular potency. To further improve the cellular potency, we also explored the hinge binding moiety (Table 6). As shown previously, when combined with the appropriate tertiary amine pendant, compounds containing a pyridine carboxamide were potent KDR inhibitors (compounds 20, 22, and 24 in Table 5 and compound 27 in Table 6). Similar to the benzimidazole series, compounds 28-30 illustrate that a dimethoxyquinoline and quinazoline heterocycles were optimal. Although removal of the 6- and

therefore prepared the 7-fluoro and 7-chloro derivates. Surprisingly, as shown by compounds 36-38 (Table 7), substitution at the 7-position of the benzoxazole did not yield any significant improvement in enzyme or cellular potencies compared to the corresponding unsubstituted analogs. Pharmacokinetic Studies Several 2-aminoazoles with suitable inhibitory activity in the kinase enzyme and cellular proliferation assays were evaluated for their in vivo pharmacokinetics in male Sprague-Dawley rats (Table 8). Compounds were administered by both intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) dosing routes. Compounds 12 and 34 displayed reasonable clearance values (Cl ) 1.0 and 1.24 L/h/ kg, respectively), but had a low oral bioavailablity (24 and 17 %F, respectively). Dimethoxyquinazoline (28), dimethoxyquinoline (30), and pyridine carboxamide (22) had improved bioavailability (40-67 %F). In general, the 2-aminoazoles tested exhibited moderate to high Cl and a high volume of distribution

7-methoxy groups resulted in an 8-fold drop in enzyme potency, the cellular activities were comparable (30 vs 31). As observed in the benzimidazole series, compounds with an amino pyrimidine hinge binding moiety exemplified exhibited a loss in cellular activity (32 and 33). Finally, good cellular potency can also be achieved with an azaindole binding the hinge and an appropriately substituted aniline (compound 34). In an attempt to improve the enzyme potency further, we returned to the crystal structure. Based on the structure of 3 with KDR, we noted a small to medium sized lipophilic pocket that could be accessed by placing a substituent at the 7-position of the bicyclic core (Figure 5). We proposed that placement of a substituent at this position could increase potency. We

after i.v. dosing. Compounds 22, 28, and 30 all exhibited acceptable half-lives and oral bioavailability for further in vivo evaluation. Selectivity. To evaluate compounds in an in vivo setting, it was critical to understand the kinase selectivity profile. To measure the selectivity of this series in a cellular assay, compounds 22, 28, and 30 were evaluated in a fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF)-driven HUVEC proliferation assay (Table 9). While compounds 28 and 30 displayed moderate selectivity (10fold) for VEGF-driven cellular proliferation, compound 22 exhibited the best selectivity (28-fold) over FGF-induced HUVEC proliferation (IC50(V-HUVEC) ) 15 nM, IC50(F-HUVEC) ) 420 nM). Compound 22 was further profiled against an extended panel of kinase enzymes, including receptor tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases. As summarized in Table 10, compound 22 exhibited excellent enzymatic selectivity. Within the protein tyrosine kinase family, 22 showed excellent levels of selectivity (>100-fold) over Tie-2, FGF, Src, IGFR-1, and EGFR. Similar selectivity was seen over kinases in the serine/threonine group (MAP, GSK3-b, CDK). As expected, due to the close homology of KDR to cFMS and cKit, only modest selectivity was observed

(16-fold and 6-fold, respectively). Based on its favorable selectivity profile in both the enzyme and the cellular assays and pharmacokinetics, compound 22 was further examined in our animal efficacy models. Animal Efficacy Models. Vascular Permeability. The in vivo activity of compound 22 on VEGF-induced vascular permeability was assessed in a modified Miles assay18 (Figure 6). For this assay, HEK 293 cells, transfected with murine VEGF or vector control were mixed with Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into CD-1 Nu/Nu mice. Compound 22 was administered orally 22 h after injection of the cells at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg doses. Six hours after administration of compound, vascular permeability in the skin overlying the Matrigel plug was measured by the quantization of extravasated Evan's blue dye. In mice dosed with 22, linear pharmacokinetics was observed. Although the responses at 10 and 30 mg/kg were not statistically significant, a strong inhibition of vascular permeability at 100 mg/kg (79%) was observed. Angiogenesis. To evaluate the in vivo VEGF-mediated antiangiogenic activity of compound 22, a rat corneal model of angiogenesis was performed (Figure 7). A disk infused with rHu-VEGF was placed in the rat cornea to stimulate blood vessel formation from the limbal vessels of the eye toward the disk. The rats were then treated with 22 at doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg once a day orally. Treatment began on the day of implantation and continued for 7 days. Two vascular endpoints were evaluated: the number of blood vessels at the midpoint between the limbus and the disk and the mean blood vessel area.

upon oral dosing in both the mouse Matrigel and the rat corneal models. Although compound 22 is less efficacious in the rat corneal model compared to motesanib,19 it represents one step toward identification of a novel series of potent KDR inhibitors with strong antitumor activity in vivo. Reports detailing the discovery of these compounds will be published hereafter. Experimental Section
General Considerations. Unless otherwise noted, all materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Anhydrous solvents were obtained from Aldrich and used directly. All reactions involving air- or moisture-sensitive reagents were performed under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere. All final compounds were purified to >95% purity, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC: A, Zorbax SB-C8, 4.6 × 150 mm, 15 min; flow rate ) 1.5 mL/min; gradient ) 0 to 100% 0.1% TFA in CH3CN/100 to 0% 0.1% TFA in water; B, Zorbax SB-C8, 4.6 × 150 mm, 12 min; flow rate ) 1.5 mL/ min; gradient ) 10 to 90% 0.1% formic acid in CH3CN/90 to 10% 0.1% formic acid in water; C, Phenomenex Synergi, 2 × 50 mm, 3 min, flow rate ) 1.0 mL/min; gradient ) 5 to 95% 0.1% formic acid in CH3CN/95 to 5% 0.1% formic acid in water). Silica gel chromatography was performed using either glass columns packed with silica gel (230-400 mesh), prepacked silica gel cartridges (Isco or Biotage), or preparative thin-layer chromatography plates (Analtech, 1000 microns). NMR spectra were determined using a Varian 300 or 400 MHz spectrometer. Preparative reverse-phase HPLC was performed using Gilson 306 gradient elution pump, YMC ODSAQ reverse-phase silica gel column and a Gilson variable wavelength UV/vis-155 detector. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed using an Agilent MSD-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI dual channel source. The instrument was calibrated using Agilent ESI-MS tuning mixture (ES Tuning Mix PN G2421A). The tuning mixture was continuously infused on the second ESI channel, and the 622.02895 Da ion was used to provide a lock-mass correction to the calibration function. All samples were diluted to an appropriate concentration so that the number of counts per scan was less that 10e5 to prevent dead-time distortion of the measurement. 4-((2-((4-Chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)amino)-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl)oxy)-N-methyl-2-pyridinecarboxamide (3). To a solution of 4-(3,4-diamino-phenoxy)-pyridine-2-carboxylic acid methylamide (0.07 g, 0.27 mmol) in CH3CN (20 mL) was added dropwise, over 5 min, a solution of 1-chloro-4-isothiocyanato-2trifluoromethyl-benzene (0.055 g, 0.27 mmol) in CH3CN (10 mL). The reaction was stirred 18 h at rt. The reaction was diluted with additional CH3CN (10 mL), followed by addition of EDC (0.078 g, 0.41 mmol). The reaction was heated at 80 °C for 3 h, allowed to cool to rt, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was dissolved in EtOAc and water. The layers were separated, and the

complexed with KDR was obtained. As shown in Figure 8, compound 22 binds largely as predicted based on our structure of compound 3 bound to KDR. Hydrogen bonds between the hinge-region Cys 919 are observed with both the nitrogen of the pyridine and the carboxamide-NH. The benzoxazole core is oriented in the hydrophobic pocket flanked by Val 917. The endocyclic nitrogen of the aminobenzoxazole hydrogen bonds with the NH of Asp 1046 and the exocyclic NH picks up a key interaction with side chain of Glu 885. The aniline aryl ring occupies the second hydrophobic pocket with the N-methyl pyrrolidine side chain directed to a solvent-exposed portion of the protein. Conclusion Guided by X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling, we identified a new class of KDR inhibitors: 2-aminobenzimidazoles. While the 2-aminobenzimidazoles were potent enzyme inhibitors, achieving good cellular potency remained a challenge. A detailed understanding of the key interactions between the ligand and the receptor prompted the replacement of the 2-aminobenzimidazole core by a 2-aminobenzoxazole. Optimization of the hinge binding heterocycle as well as the aryl ring occupying the second hydrophobic pocket resulted in several benzoxazoles with good enzyme and cellular potencies. Among them, compound 22 emerged as the best candidate for in vivo evaluation. Compound 22 showed on mechanism in vivo activity

The 50 µL of reaction volume was incubated for 60 min at rt. The reaction was quenched by a 30-fold dilution into detection mix consisting of 100 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, 10 mM EDTA, 1 nM ruthenylated antirabbit antibody (BioVeris), 1 nM antiphosphothreonine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), and 7.5 µg streptavidin paramagnetic beads (Dynal) and incubated with agitation at rt for 60 min. The plate was read on a M-Series M8 Analyzer (BioVeris). The proportion of substrate phosphorylated in the kinase reactions in the presence of compound compared with that phosphorylated in the presence of DMSO vehicle alone (HI control) was calculated using the formula: % control (POC) ) (cmpd - average LO)/(average HI - average LO) × 100. Data (consisting of POC and inhibitor concentration in µM) was fitted to a four-parameter equation (y ) A + ((B A)/(1 + ((x/C)D))), where A is the minimum y (POC) value, B is the maximum y (POC), C is the x (cmpd concentration) at the point of inflection, and D is the slope factor) using a LevenburgMarquardt nonlinear regression algorithm. The inhibition constant (Ki) of the inhibitor was estimated from the IC50 (cmpd concentration at the point of inflection; C) using the Cheng-Prussof equation: Ki ) IC50 /(1 + S/Km), where S is the ATP substrate concentration and Km is the Michaelis constant for ATP as determined experimentally. HUVEC Proliferation Assay. HUVEC proliferation assays were performed as previously described.10e Briefly HUVECs were cultured in endothelial growth medium-2 (Cambrex). One day before the assay was run, HUVEC were seeded into flat-bottom, 96-well plates (BD Falcon) at 3000 cells per well in DMEM medium with 10% qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1× penicillin, streptomycin, and L-glutamine (1× PSG). After culture for 22 h, media was removed and HUVEC were preincubated for 2 h with serial dilutions of small molecule diluted 1:400 in DMEM with 10% FBS plus 1× PSG. HUVEC were then challenged with 50 ng/mL VEGF or 20 ng/mL bFGF and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were washed 2× with DPBS, and plates were frozen at -70 °C for 24 h. Plates were thawed, incubated with CyQuant dye (Molecular Probes), and read on a Victor 1420 Workstation (Perkin-Elmer Corporation). IC50 data was calculated using the Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm into a 4-parameter logistic equation (ID Business Solutions, Ltd.) and expressed in µM. Pharmacokinetic Studies. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed via femoral vein (intravenous, DMSO solution, dose 1 mg/ kg) or via oral gavage (suspensions in Ora-Plus, pH adjusted to a range of 2.0-2.2 using methanesulfonic acid, dose 10 mg/kg). Concentrations of all formulations were selected as to allow for dose volumes in accordance with the highest scientific, humane, and ethical principals as defined by IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees).25 Serial blood samples were collected from jugular vein into heparized tubes over a 12-24 h period. Plasma was separated by centrifugation, and the sample was prepared for analysis by protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Quantitation of the test compounds was accomplished by reversed liquid chromatography with mass spectral detection in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with an appropriate internal standard. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half-life were calculated by a noncompartmental method. Vascular Permeability Assay. Vascular permeability was induced using a modified Miles assay.18 HEK 293 cells overexpressing murine VEGF were used to induce vascular permeability in nude mice. Briefly, 2 × 105 VEGF-expressing or vector control HEK 293 cells were mixed with Matrigel and injected subcutaneously on the ventral surface of nude mice. Approximately 22 h later, a single oral dose of compound or vehicle was administered. After 6 h, the mice received an intravenous injection of 0.1 mL 1% Evan's blue dye for 10 min prior to sacrifice. A 1 cm2 piece of skin overlying the cells was harvested and placed in formamide at

60 °C overnight. The extracted Evan's blue dye was measured using a spectrophotometer at OD630. Relative Evan's blue units refer to the % Evan's blue, as determined by the standard curve, multiplied by 104. Data represent mean ( standard error; n ) 5. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA with BonferroniDunn post hoc test. p < 0.0009 was considered significant. Rat Corneal Angiogenesis Model. Corneal angiogenesis was evaluated in female CD rats as described.26 Briefly, rats weighing approximately 250 grams were randomized into one of six treatment groups. Angiogenesis was induced by surgically implanting a VEGF (or BSA control)-soaked nylon disk into the corneal stroma (n ) 8/group). Rats were treated with 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg orally once a day with compound or vehicle. Treatment began on the day of surgery and was continued for 7 days. Two vascular endpoints were evaluated: the number of blood vessels at the midpoint between the limbal vessels and the disk and the mean blood vessel area. After 7 days, the implanted corneas were photographed at 25× using a Nikon SV-3 Ophthalmic Slit Lamp (Nikon Ophthalmic) equipped with a Nikon D-1 digital camera back. A reference stage micrometer was photographed for calibration. The images were transferred to a desktop PC, reformatted for image analysis, and transferred to a Metamorph IA system for computerized analysis. Numerical data were generated from the digital images using the Metamorph image analysis system (Universal Imaging). Three endpoints were analyzed on each corneal image: (1) disk placement distance from the limbus, (2) number of vessels intersecting a perpendicular line at the midpoint of the disk placement distance, and (3) blood vessel area, as determined by RGB thresholding and automated pixel counting. Image analysis was performed in a blinded fashion. Values represent the group mean ( standard error. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference post hoc test.

(15) Compound 3 was claimed as a raf inhibitor in the following Chiron patent application: Substituted Benzoxazoles and Use Thereof as Raf Kinase Inhibitors. WO2003082272, 2003. (16) For most of the substrates, the reactions were carried out neat. However, in the preparation of compound 52d (containing the pyrrolopyrimidine moiety), use of triethylamine and trifluroacetic acid (1:1 mixture) as the solvent was required. Even under these conditions, the product was isolated in a poor 14% yield. (17) The following reference provides support for CH-O hydrogen-bonds in protein-ligand interactions: Pierce, A.
