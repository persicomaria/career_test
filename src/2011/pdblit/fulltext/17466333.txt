Abstract A novel host cell post-translational modification system termed sumoylation was discovered recently. Sumoylation is an enzymatic process that is biochemically analogous to, but functionally distinct from ubiquitinylation. As in ubiquitinylation, sumoylation involves the attachment of a small protein moiety, SUMO, to substrate proteins. Conjugation of SUMO does not typically lead to degradation of the substrate and instead causes functional alterations or changes in intracellular localization. While the majority of identified SUMO targets are cellular proteins, both herpesvirus and papillomavirus proteins have also been identified as authentic substrates for this modification. The exact effect of sumoylation on viral proteins appears to be substrate specific, but does have functional consequences that are likely to be important for the viral life cycle. In addition to viral proteins being targets for sumoylation, there is both direct and indirect evidence that viruses can alter the sumoylation status of host cell proteins. Such modulation of critical host proteins may be important for inhibiting cellular defense mechanisms or for promoting an intracellular state that is supportive of viral reproduction. This review highlights the enzymology of sumoylation and discusses the known examples of how viruses impact and are impacted by sumoylation. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Consequently, studies of virus ­host interactions not only facilitate development of therapeutic strategies, but often provide new insights into fundamental cellular processes as well. One type of viral ­host interaction that is well established and widespread is modulation of viral protein function by post-translational modification systems such as phosphorylation, glycosyla-

tion, and ubiquitinylation. More recently, a new host cell post-translational modification system has been defined and termed sumoylation or sentrinization. While not yet completely understood in terms of functional effects, sumoylation appears to regulate protein activity and/or intracellular location. Basic features of the sumoylation process will be summarized in this review with a focus on viral targets. More extensive background on sumoylation can be found in several previous reviews (Johnson and Hochstrasser, 1997; Saitoh et al., 1997; Kretz-Remy and Tanguay, 1999; Hochstrasser, 2000; Melchior, 2000; Yeh et al., 2000; Muller et al., 2001). Sumoylation is the process of covalently attaching a SUMO moiety to a target protein; SUMO-1 is itself a 101 amino acid polypeptide with sequence relatedness to ubiquitin (Lapenta et al., 1997). The discovery of SUMO-1 was made independently by several investigators in diverse assays including yeast 2-hybrid screens (Boddy et al., 1996; Okura et al., 1996; Shen et al., 1996), biochemical analysis of the nuclear transport component, RanGAP1 (Matunis et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997), and cDNA mapping of human chromosome 21 (Lapenta et al., 1997). Due to this multiple, independent identification, vertebrate SUMO-1 has numerous alternative names such as PIC1 (Boddy et al., 1996), UBL1 (Shen et al., 1996), Sentrin (Kamitani et al., 1997), GMP1 (Matunis et al., 1996), and hSMT3C (Lapenta et al., 1997). SUMO-1 is evolutionarily conserved and the S. cere6isiae homolog is encoded by the SMT3 gene (Meluh and Koshland, 1995). In contrast to yeast and invertebrates with only one SUMO-encoding gene, vertebrate species have multiple SUMO genes. In humans, there are at least two additional genes for SUMO-1 related proteins, hSMT3A (SUMO-2) and hSMT3B (SUMO-3) (Lapenta et al., 1997). The SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 proteins are more closely related with 87% identity compared to 47% identity between SUMO-2 and SUMO-1. Saitoh and Hinchey (2000) recently showed that there are larger pools of free SUMO-2/3 than SUMO-1 in vertebrate cells, and that SUMO-2/3 conjugates poorly to a major SUMO-1 substrate, RanGAP1. These results indicate that there are significant

quantitative and qualitative differences between the two subfamilies that are likely to have biologically significant implications. However, due to the paucity of studies on SUMO-2/3, this review will deal exclusively with SUMO-1.

2. Enzymology of sumoylation Sumoylation parallels the classical ubiquitinylation pathway with three discrete steps: activation, conjugation, and substrate modification (Fig. 1). Prior to the activation step, the 101 amino acid SUMO-1 protein must undergo an endoproteolytic cleavage to remove the C-terminal 4 residues and generate an essential Gly­Gly C-terminus (Kamitani et al., 1997). This step is catalyzed by a group of cysteine proteases collectively termed ULPs (ubiquitin-like, protein-processing enzyme). The yeast versions, Ulp1 and Ulp 2, can not only process the SUMO-1 precursor, but can also cleave SUMO from substrates (Li and Hochstrasser, 1999, 2000). Several mammalian homologs have been isolated (designated SENPs or SUSPs for Sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases), and additional members of this family are present in expressed sequence tag databases (Gong et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2000; Nishida et al., 2000; Yeh et al., 2000). While it is not yet clear if these mammalian enzymes all catalyze both SUMO processing and desumoylation of substrates, there is evidence of differences both in intracellular location and substrate specificity for these proteases. These biochemical differences, along with the large number of mammalian SENPs, suggest that sumoylation/desumoylation is a dynamic process that will have regulatory implications for cellular function. Subsequent to the proteolytic processing of SUMO, the terminal glycine is covalently attached via a thioester linkage to a cysteine residue of the activating enzyme in an ATP-dependent reaction (Johnson et al., 1997). While the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, is a monomeric protein, the SUMO-activating enzyme is a heterodimer in both yeast (Johnson et al., 1997) and metazoans (Desterro et al., 1999; Gong et al., 1999). Both subunits, the 38 kDa Aos1 and the 71

V.G. Wilson, D. Rangasamy / Virus Research 81 (2001) 17­27

19

kDa Uba2, are essential in S. cere6isiae (Johnson et al., 1997) and show 33 and 34% sequence identity with their human counterparts, SAE1 and SAE2, respectively (Melchior, 2000). Interestingly, Aos1/SAE1 and Uba2/SAE2 also have partial sequence identity with their cognate species E1 enzymes. Aos1/SAE1 aligns with the N-terminal region of E1 and Uba2/SAE2 shares identity with the C-terminal half of E1. These conserved regions include a nucleotide binding motif in each subunit and the residues flanking the cysteine site for SUMO-1 attachment in Uba2/SAE2. Step two in the sumoylation process is the transfer of SUMO-1 from the activation enzyme to the 18 kDa, monomeric conjugating enzyme, Ubc9 (Johnson and Blobel, 1997; Lee et al., 1998; Saitoh et al., 1998). This transacetylation reaction results in covalent attachment of SUMO-1 through a thioester linkage with cysteine 93 of the

human Ubc9 protein (Gong et al., 1997). Again, there is extensive amino acid identity (56%) between the yeast and human proteins, including conservation of the active cysteine at residue 93 (Watanabe et al., 1996). The sequence conservation also extends to function as the mammalian Ubc9 gene can complement a S. cere6isiae temperature-sensitive Ubc9 mutation (Hateboer et al., 1996; Yasugi and Howley, 1996). Unlike the comparable step in the ubiquitinylation pathway where there are numerous members of the E2 class of enzymes (Hershko and Cienchanover, 1998), Ubc9 is the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation. Furthermore, Ubc9 is specific for SUMO-1 conjugation and will not function with ubiquitin (Desterro et al., 1997; Saitoh et al., 1998). Crystallographic analysis shows that Ubc9 has important structural deviations from the classical ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes which

Fig. 1. Enzymology of sumoylation. The sumoylation process is illustrated in three steps analogous to the E1 ­ E3 stages of ubiquitinylation; the key enzymes and components are indicated. Activation is an ATP-dependent step resulting in the covalent attachment of the carboxy-terminal processed SUMO-1 protein to a cysteine residue in the heterodimeric activator, Aos1/Uba2. Subsequently, the SUMO-1 moiety is transferred to cysteine 93 in the conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. Ubc9 then directly interacts with numerous substrate proteins and catalyzes the transfer of SUMO-1 to the o-amino group of a substrate lysine residue. The resulting isopeptide bond is stable and requires a desumoylating enzyme for removal of the conjugated SUMO-1. E3 ligases utilized in ubiquitinylation have not yet been identified for sumoylation and may not be required.

20

likely accounts for the SUMO-1 specificity (Tong et al., 1997; Giraud et al., 1998). In the final step of sumoylation, the Ubc9­ SUMO conjugate conveys the SUMO moiety to the target protein. No SUMO-specific enzymes comparable to the E3-type ubiquitin ligases have been identified, and there is no absolute requirement for such an enzyme during in vitro sumoylation reactions (Desterro et al., 1999). Using both yeast 2-hybrid and in vitro interaction assays, Ubc9 exhibits direct binding to its substrates, so targeting via substrate-specific ligases as for ubiquitin may be unnecessary (Yeh et al., 2000). Nonetheless, the observed differential regulation of SUMO conjugation to diverse targets in vivo could be accounted for by the existence of targetspecific SUMO ligases (reviewed in Melchior, 2000). Consequently, the role and existence of SUMO ligases remain unknown. Unlike the thioester linkage between SUMO and its carrier enzymes, the final attachment to the substrate protein occurs between the C-terminal carboxy group of SUMO and the o-amino group of a lysine in the target protein (Mahajan et al., 1998). The resultant isopeptide bond is stable to reduction and requires enzymatic cleavage for removal of the SUMO group. Most known sumoylation substrates have a single target lysine residue, but a few such as PML (Kamitani et al., 1998) and human cytomegalovirus IE2 protein (Hofmann et al., 2000; Ahn et al., 2001) have multiple addition sites. Formation of poly-SUMO chains does not occur as it does for ubiquitin due to the absence of a lysine residue in SUMO-1 at the position comparable to the critical Lys 48 of ubiquitin (Bayer et al., 1998).

3. Sumoylation of viral proteins It is now clear from studies over the last several years that while ubiquitinylation and sumoylation are enzymatically analogous processes, they are distinct biochemical pathways with different biological roles. In contrast to ubiquitinylation which primarily targets proteins for degradation (Hershko and Cienchanover, 1998), sumoylation has more diverse effects and can alter substrate intra-

cellular localization (Muller et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1999; Bhaskar et al., 2000; Rangasamy et al., 2000), protein­ protein interaction (Matunis et al., 1998), and functional activity (Rodriguez et al., 1999; Muller et al., 2000). Though the complete spectrum of roles for sumoylation and the precise mechanisms of action remain open, the list of cellular and viral targets that are covalently modified by SUMO-1 is growing rapidly (Table 1). Currently, there are published reports of four viral proteins that are modified by SUMO-1 addition: cytomegalovirus (CMV) IE1 (Muller and Dejean, 1999) and IE2 (Hofmann et al., 2000; Ahn et al., 2001), the Epstein­Barr virus (EBV) BZLF1 protein (Adamson and Kenney, 2001), and papillomavirus E1 proteins (Rangasamy and Wilson, 2000; Rangasamy et al., 2000). In addition, both the adenovirus E1A protein and the vaccinia virus E3L protein have been shown to physically interact with components of the sumoylation system, murine Ubc9 protein for E1A (Hateboer et al., 1996) and SUMO-1 for E3L (Rogan and Heaphy, 2000). Since virtually all known sumoylated proteins can bind either SUMO-1 and/or Ubc9, it is likely that E1A and EL3 are themselves sumoylated though this remains to be experimentally demonstrated. As with sumoylated cellular proteins, the biological effect of sumoylation on viral proteins will likely be target specific. Papillomavirus E1 proteins are nuclear, originrecognition proteins that are essential for viral genomic DNA replication (Chow and Broker, 1994). Both human (HPV) and bovine (BPV) papillomavirus E1 proteins assemble into hexameric structures with intrinsic, ATP-dependent, helicase activity (Seo et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1993; Liu et al., 1998; Fouts et al., 1999). As for many sumoylation targets, the initial suggestion that bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E1 might be a substrate for this modification came from protein­ protein interaction studies. Yeast 2-hybrid library screening identified the Ubc9 enzyme as a partner for BPV E1, and this was subsequently confirmed by in vitro binding studies with GST-Ubc9 and radiolabeled E1 protein (Rangasamy and Wilson, 2000). Use of truncated E1 proteins localized the critical region for Ubc9 binding to C-terminal half

of the E1 protein (residues 315­ 605). Though no simple motif has been defined for Ubc9 interaction, comparison of the E1 sequence with other Ubc9-binding proteins revealed some modest similarities in the E1 region from residues 410­ 430. The functional importance of this region was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis which demonstrated that an LK motif at residues 420/ 421 was critical for E1­ Ubc9 interaction. While specific Ubc9 interaction is highly suggestive that a protein will be a substrate for sumoylation, this must be confirmed in vitro and/ or in vivo. In vitro sumoylation systems were first developed by Mahajan et al. (1997) using an extract from digitonin solubilized HeLa cells, and by Desterro et al. (1999) using purified SAE1/2 and Ubc9. Typically, an 35S-labeled target protein is incubated with the in vitro system and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm a molecular weight increase consistent with addition of one or more SUMO moieties. For BPV E1, one new species was observed in vitro whose molecular weight indicated that a single SUMO-1 molecule

had been covalently attached (Rangasamy and Wilson, 2000). As illustrated in Table 2, authentic E1 sumoylation required all the protein components (SAE1/2, Ubc9, and SUMO) and an ATPregenerating system. Use of the Ubc9 active site mutant, C93A, prevented sumoylation, as did inclusion of dithiothreitol (DTT) since the thioester linkage of SUMO to both SAE2 and Ubc9 is

sensitive to reduction (Desterro et al., 1999). Lastly, incubation of in vitro sumoylated E1 with a SUMO-specific protease, Ulp1, eliminated the E1 ­SUMO product without affecting full-length E1, confirming that the E1­ SUMO conjugate had an authentic isopeptide linkage (Rangasamy and Wilson, 2000). SUMO-modified E1 was also identified in vivo after transfection and expression of HA-tagged E1. Immunoprecipitation with antiHA followed by Western blotting with anti-HA and anti-SUMO-1 revealed two E1 species, a fulllength E1 without SUMO-1 and a larger species comparable to the in vitro product that was immunoreactive with both anti-HA and antiSUMO-1. The combined in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that E1 is a recognizable substrate for the sumoylation system. Failure to detect the SUMO-modified E1 previously likely resulted from the prevalence of SUMO proteases which rapidly desumoylate proteins in nondenaturing cell extracts unless inactivated by cysteine protease inhibitors. The bovine papillomavirus E1 protein has a single sumoylation site at lysine 514 that can be SUMO-1 conjugated in vitro or in vivo. BPV lysine 514 and flanking sequences are well conserved in human and other animal papillomaviruses suggesting that sumoylation of E1 proteins may be a universal property of these replication enzymes. Consistent with this prediction, HPV type 1a and 18 are both sumoylated in vitro, though the site of sumoylation has not been determined (Rangasamy et al., 2000). Mutation of BPV E1 lysine 514 to arginine results in loss of replication capacity due to sequestration of E1 in the cytoplasm, and an identical phenotype is observed for E1 mutants that are not sumoylated due to inability to bind Ubc9 (Rangasamy et al., 2000). The inability of unsumoylated E1 to accumulate in the nucleus indicates that this modification is essential for nuclear uptake and/or retention. The mechanism for this effect is not obvious as there are numerous steps in nuclear import or retention of E1 that could be affected by attachment of the SUMO moiety. Whether or not sumoylation of wildtype E1 also normally modulates other E1 activities is unknown. However, the site of sumoylation resides within the

region of E1 critical for ATPase and helicase activities (Yang et al., 1993; MacPherson et al., 1994; Raj and Stanley, 1995), E2 interaction (Lusky and Fontane, 1991; Sarafi and McBride, 1995; Titolo et al., 1999), and oligomerization (Titolo et al., 2000). Therefore, conjugation of the large SUMO-1 moiety might be expected to influence one or more of these activities. Consequently, it is likely that in addition to a role in nuclear localization, sumoylation/desumoylation of intranuclear E1 will also have regulatory implications for E1 functions. The CMV immediate early (IE) proteins are potent transcriptional activators that localize to nuclear domain 10 (ND10) bodies (Hagemeier et al., 1992; Ahn and Hayward, 1997). CMV IE2 protein has two sites for SUMO-1 addition, lysines 175 and 180, and simultaneous substitution of both lysines with arginine residues (which cannot be sumoylated) has no effect on intranuclear targeting of IE2 to ND10 bodies (Hofmann et al., 2000; Ahn et al., 2001). However, in transfection studies the double mutant showed a 5- to 10-fold reduction in transactivation of the CMV UL112/ 113 and UL84 promoters, as well as on the heterologous HIV-LTR promoter (Hofmann et al., 2000). In a related study, overexpression of SUMO-1 enhanced IE2-dependent transactivation of the cyclin E promoter, though not the viral Pol promoter (Ahn et al., 2001). While no effect of the 175/180 double mutant was observed for the cyclin E promoter in this second study, the combined results support the conclusion that sumoylation contributes to full transactivation activity of IE2, at least on some promoters. Consistent with this sumoylation effect on IE2, enhancement of transcriptional activation function by SUMO-1 conjugation has also been observed for p53 (Gostissa et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 1999). The mechanism of transcriptional activation potentiation by sumoylation is unknown, but could reflect increased interaction between the activator protein and the basal transcription machinery. Alternatively, sumoylation could have a more indirect effect by modulating activator protein oligomerization or stability. The other CMV IE protein, IE1, is also sumoylated though the neither the site of sumoylation

23

nor the effect of sumoylation on IE1 function is known (Muller and Dejean, 1999). IE1 expression does decreases sumoylation of two cellular components of ND10s, PML and Sp100, but whether or not this effect on the host cell proteins actually requires sumoylation of IE1 has yet to be determined. Interestingly, immediate early proteins from other members of the Herpesvirus family also reduce PML sumoylation. The EBV BZLF1 product (Z protein) has a single sumoylation site at residue 12, and Z reduces sumoylation of PML by outcompeting for a limiting pool of SUMO-1 (Adamson and Kenney, 2001). In contrast, the herpes simplex ICPO protein similarly reduces sumoylation of PML, yet ICPO is not sumoylated (Parkinson and Everett, 2000). PML is an essential component of ND10s, and sumoylation of PML is required for ND10 assembly as well as recruitment of other ND10-associated proteins (Ishov et al., 1999; Zhong et al., 2000). While their precise role remains somewhat cryptic, there is extensive evidence suggesting the ND10s exert antiviral effects that must be overcome early in virus infection to establish productive replication (Maul et al., 2000; Burkham et al., 2001). Thus, it appears that one common function of Herpesviridae IE proteins is to disrupt ND10s, at least in part through abrogation of PML sumoylation. Clearly though, this effect on PML can be accomplished by mechanistically diverse means as sumoylation of the viral IE protein itself is not required in all cases.

4. Viral Ulp-like proteases Direct modification of viral proteins by sumoylation can alter their intracellular location or function, presumably in ways that favor virus reproduction. However, it is likely that there are also more subtle interfaces between viruses and the host cell sumoylation system. For example, some host cell proteins, such as p53 and PML, that may contribute to antiviral defense are themselves sumoylated (Kamitani et al., 1998; Muller et al., 1998; Gostissa et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 1999). Sumoylation of p53 is re-

quired for full transcriptional and apoptotic activity (Gostissa et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 1999; Muller et al., 2000), while sumoylation of PML is required for ND10s as discussed above. Consequently, viral interference with sumoylation of these or other host cell proteins could diminish defense mechanisms and/or confer a more favorable host cell environment for viral propagation. Reduction in the amount of sumoylated host protein could be accomplished by preventing sumoylation, either by direct competition as for the EBV BZLF protein or by other undefined mechanisms. Alternatively, viral enhancement of desumoylation would yield the same net result. Intriguingly, several viral proteases have sequence and functional similarity to the SUMO-specific Ulp proteases (Li and Hochstrasser, 1999), suggesting that these viral enzymes could serve dual functions in processing viral proteins and in cleaving sumoylated host proteins. Li and Hochstrasser (1999) first noted that yeast Ulp1 has an approximately 90 amino acid core domain, including the His­Asp/Glu ­Cys catalytic triad, with similarity to the adenovirus L3 endoprotease (also called AVP), the I7 protein of poxviruses, and the S273R protein of African swine fever virus (ASFV). All three of these cysteine proteases cleave viral precursor proteins at motifs identical or closely related to the Gly­Gly ­X cleavage site on SUMO-1 and ubiquitin (Lopez-Otin et al., 1989; Lee and Hruby, 1994), though the ability of the viral proteases to actually desumoylate host proteins has not been examined. Additionally, all three viral proteases are found in virions, which is consistent with a role in early infection (Anderson, 1990; Kane and Shuman, 1993; Andres et al., 2001). While the adenovirus endoprotease is known to play a role in viral entry and uncoating (Cotten and Weber, 1995; Greber et al., 1996), this does not rule out a possible subsequent role for L3, or the other viral proteases, in desumoylation of host cell proteins. In support of this concept, the YopJ protein of Yersinia pestis was recently shown to be a Ulplike protease also (Orth et al., 2000). YopJ is a virulence factor that is translocated into host

24

V.G. Wilson, D. Rangasamy / Virus Research 81 (2001) 17­27

cells where it inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Transfection studies demonstrated that YopJ expression resulted in decreased intracellular levels of total SUMO conjugates. Proteolytically inactive YopJ mutants did not reduce levels of SUMO conjugates, failed to inhibit the MAPK pathway, and were attenuated for virulence. These results are consistent with desumoylation being at least part of the pathogenic mechanism. It remains to be seen if the viral Ulp-like proteases, either the virion-associated form or the de novo synthesized products, can act in a similar fashion on host cell substrates. It should also be noted that viruses could increase desumoylation by upregulating expression of host Ulps rather than introducing new Ulp-like enzymes, though no example of this mechanism has been defined yet.

6. Summary As with other host cell regulatory processes and pathways, viruses have undoubtedly evolved diverse strategies to exploit the sumoylation system. While the interactions of viruses with the sumoylation system have just barely begun to be identified and characterized, there is evidence for at least three major interfaces. First, it is clear from published work that viral proteins can be sumoylated, and that this modification can regulate protein function and/or intracellular location. Additional discovery of other sumoylated viral proteins seems likely with more extensive investigation, and exact molecular mechanisms by which SUMO modulates protein activity or distribution remain to be elucidated. Second, several studies with members of the Herpesvirus family indicate that viruses can influence the sumoylation state of cellular proteins. Reducing sumoylation of critical cell proteins may help overcome cellular antiviral defense systems or simply induce a more advantageous intracellular milieu. Except for the EBV BZLF protein, the mechanism by which sumoylation is abrogated is unclear. The presence of Ulp-like proteases encoded by some viruses suggests that one method of desumoylating host proteins could be via direct cleavage by the viral enzyme. Clearly though, less direct strategies must also exist as viral Ulp-like proteases are not universal. Finally, utilization of host Ulps to process some viral proteins is a reasonable possibility in search of verification. To date, only the unusual case of BVDV NS3 protein has been demonstrated, and since this example requires insertion of a host gene into the viral genome it is unlikely to be a widespread mechanism. Hopefully the near future will provide more general examples of this third interface, as well as more detailed understanding of the sumoylation system and its roles in viral infection.

5. Cleavage of viral proteins by Ulps The similarity between certain viral proteases and host Ulps raises the possibility that processing of some viral proteins could be performed by host rather than viral enzymes. While again this scenario has not yet been observed, a related process has been characterized with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). BVDV exists in two biotypes, cytopathic and noncytopathic, which differ only in expression of an 80-kDa NS3 protein by the cytopathic type (Donis and Dubovi, 1987). Expression of NS3 appears to result primarily from genome insertions that result in a new processing event which liberates an NS3 polypeptide from the parental NS2-3 protein. The majority of these insertion events involve the host cell sequences for ubiquitin (Meyers et al., 1991), but more recently a case of SUMO-2 gene insertion was characterized (Qi et al., 1998). The introduction of the Gly­Gly ­ X motif found in both ubiquitin and SUMO likely leads to Ulp cleavage of the fusion protein resulting in release of an NS3 protein. While this may be a situation unique to Pestiviruses, it is a clear manifestation of another way viruses can utilize the host cell sumoylation (or ubiquitinylation) system to their advantage.
