Malleability of protein folding pathways: a simple reason for complex behaviour
Magnus O Lindberg and Mikael Oliveberg
Although the structures of native proteins are generally unique, the pathways by which they form are often free to vary. Some proteins fold by a multitude of different pathways, whereas others seem restricted to only one choice. An explanation for this variation in folding behaviour has recently emerged from studies of transition state changes: the number of accessible pathways is linked to the number of nucleation motifs contained within the native topology. We refer to these nucleation motifs as `foldons', as they approach the size of an independent cooperative unit. Thus, with respect to pathway malleability and the composition of the folding funnel, proteins can be seen as modular assemblies of competing foldons. For the split b-a-b fold, these foldons are two-strand-helix motifs coupled by spatial overlap.

folding transition state ensemble obtained by f-value analysis [9­11]. An early visualization of transition state changes was presented for the two-state protein U1A [12]. The study employed Hammond postulate behaviour [13] to construct a f-value movie of how the folding nucleus grows upon traversing the top of the free-energy barrier (c.f. [14]). In terms of malleability, the U1A data can be classified as representing changes `along' the folding pathway [15], that is to say, the experiment enables us to follow protein progression down the folding funnel. Complementing this picture, there have also been several perturbation studies targeting shifts to `parallel' folding pathways ([16,17]; MO ° Lindberg, PhD thesis, Umea University, 2005) and more than ten f-value characterisations of topological lookalikes with divergent sequence composition [8]. Taken together, these studies uncover a wide selection of folding patterns and varying resistance to accessing alternative pathways. The question then arises, is it yet possible to draw any general conclusions from this rapidly increasing volume of protein folding data? In an attempt to find an answer, we have chosen to focus this review on consensus features of the various folding scenarios, rather than elaborating on their differences. With such a reductionist treatment, it is possible to discern a simple structural organization underlying the complex behaviour of pathway malleability. A representative example is provided by the ribosomal protein S6. The structure of S6 seems to be composed of two nucleation motifs, each of which approaches the size of an independent cooperative unit. Each of these motifs also constitutes a separate entry to parallel folding trajectories. The coupling of the two competing nuclei (i.e. folding cooperativity) is assured by structural overlap. This organization into component subnuclei renders the order of folding events free to vary, and reconciles shifts along and across the pathway as being different facets of a common mechanism.

Introduction
Pathway malleability has recently emerged as a promising handle for elucidating the mechanism of protein folding. A major reason is that the response of the folding process to well-defined perturbations is often easier to interpret than its overall features. In addition, pathway changes provide a means of scanning details and regions of the folding energy landscape that are not revealed under `standard' conditions. During the past few years, it has also become evident that pathway malleability is not a curiosity of a few proteins, but a general phenomenon that can be induced in a variety of ways [1,2­7]. One strategy has been to perturb the folding process by the addition of denaturants, point mutations and circular permutations [2]. Alternatively, the spectrum of pathways accessible to a given protein topology can be mapped out through the analysis of structural family members with divergent sequence composition [8]. In most of these studies, the basis for comparison has been snapshots of the protein

Transition state shifts along the barrier profile
The most extensively analysed transition state movements are those that take place along the folding pathway. These movements are commonly observed as downward curves [18,19] and/or kinks [20,21] in the unfolding limbs of the chevron plots, in accordance with Hammond postulate behaviour: the more the protein is destabilized by denaturant, the closer the transition state moves towards the native protein on the experimental progress

coordinate [13]. A frequent dilemma in these experiments concerns the fine structure of the barrier profile, that is, whether the transition state movement should be treated as a continuous shift over a broad barrier or as discrete jumps between separated barrier maxima [15,20,21]. Even so, the conclusion remains qualitatively ° the same ([22]; MO Lindberg, PhD thesis, Umea UniFigure 1

versity, 2005). The f-values describe a general increase as the transition state moves along the barrier profile (Figure 1). For U1A, which displays a relatively smooth transition state shift upon addition of GdmCl, the structure grows rather symmetrically without altering the positions of the highest f-values. Structural ordering starts in the a1 half of the protein and expands progress-

ively into the a2 region as the protein approaches the native end of the folding barrier. A notable detail of the U1A analysis is a slight heterogeneity in the f-value changes. Once engaged, a few contacts in the a2 region grow faster than their neighbours, indicating some degree of self-sufficient cooperativity in this part of the structure [12]. Topologically similar ribosomal protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus (S6T) shows related Hammond behaviour, but in this case the growth of the folding nucleus is accompanied by an altered bias of the f-value distribution (Figure 1). The initial contacts of the S6T nucleus form in the a1 region, but later these seem to be overtaken by contacts between a2 and the b sheet [23]. An even more radical alteration of the f-value bias is observed in the Hammond shifts of the a-spectrin R16 domain [22]. For this protein, the folding nucleus is polarised towards the N-terminal side of the structure in the early transition state ensemble and becomes bifurcated as the folding reaction advances. Analogous patterns of f-value changes have been reported for zincsubstituted azurin [24] and myotrophin (AR Lowe, PhD Thesis, University of Cambridge, 2005). A characteristic feature of movement along the folding pathway is that folding starts in one part of the protein and then shifts emphasis to another part. This discontinuity in the local f-value coordinates shows that there are (at least) two global events at play in the folding reaction. From the data in Figure 1, it is tempting to suggest that the behaviour stems from a two-step nucleation process, that is, the protein appears to comprise two cooperative subunits that form one after the other. Fragment studies [25] and hydrogen-deuterium exchange NMR have implicated similar folding units, often corresponding to individual secondary structure elements or parts thereof, in the folding of cytochrome c [26], apo-cytochrome b562 [27­29], ribonuclease H [30,31], dimeric triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) [32] and OspA [33,34]. In apparent contrast to these studies, however, the cooperative subunits of the proteins in Figure 1 are clearly overlapping and based mainly on tertiary contacts.

appear to be more or less autonomous elements whose degree of formation in the folding nucleus depends on several factors, for example, their intrinsic helical propensity, dipolar couplings [37], and non-native intrahelical and tertiary contacts [38] (c.f. [39]). A related type of transverse transition state shift involves more global features of the protein. In contrast to the overall increasing f-values of the Hammond movements, these transition state shifts are characterised by decreased f-values in one part of the structure, balanced by increased f-values in another (c.f. [3,40]) (Figure 2). The folding nucleus simply slips sideways, often retaining approximately its original size. One of the most efficient methods for achieving this type of transverse pathway change is circular permutation, whereby the sequence separation between sidechain contacts is systematically varied [1,41­43]. In effect, the circular permutations are loop entropy perturbations. For S6T [1] and the a-spectrin SH3 domain [42,43], the resulting f-value changes have been shown to be straightforward to predict from an empirical relationship with the changes in sequence separation, DL [1] (Figure 3). Chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), on the other hand, behaves differently, being largely insensitive to circular permutation [44]. Although these results clearly emphasize the statistical nature of the folding process, they also show that transverse pathway shifts occur within the context of a more global pattern. The permutation adjusts the balance between competing nuclei and, when there is only one choice, the effect becomes small. For some proteins, transverse transition state shifts can also be induced by point mutation or addition of denaturant, as observed for the 27th immunoglobulin domain of titin (TI I27) [16] (Figure 2). Then, in terms of the underlying folding energy landscape, is it possible to discern any mechanistic connection between these transverse transition state changes and the Hammond shifts? Here, an interesting clue is provided by S6T, which is, so far, the only system for which both classes of transition state movements have been extensively characterized (Figures 1 and 2). The folding nuclei identified in the Hammond and transverse transition state movements are strikingly similar. In both cases, the folding action shifts from the a1 to the a2 region of the S6T structure: in the former case consecutively and in the latter as alternative starting points. The two subunits can assemble in any order, generating two pathways with opposite folding order. If the protein contains only one nucleation point, the pathway is confined to a single barrier maximum, resulting in more restricted transition state plasticity with characteristic growth layers [14]. Thus, the pattern of malleable twostate folding closely resembles that observed for modular repeat proteins [45­50] and multidomain proteins forming populated intermediates [51,52]. The main difference seems to be that, in cooperative two-state folding, the subunits are strongly coupled.

Transition state shifts across the folding energy landscape: the existence of parallel trajectories
The second class of transition state movements comprises those that take place across the folding energy landscape -- transverse shifts to parallel pathways. One such type of transition state change is the anti-Hammond behaviour induced by helix destabilization [35]. The phenomenon was first observed for barnase, but has subsequently been clarified in comparative studies of rapidly folding threehelix-bundle proteins [4]. When the helical propensity is increased, folding turns from nucleation-condensation behaviour to diffusion-collision behaviour, in which helical elements are fully preformed [4,36]. Thus, with respect to the mechanism of pathway malleability, helices

The structural identity of a minimal nucleation motif
Closer examination of the transition state changes in Figures 1 and 2 reveals an additional pattern. This pattern relates to the actual structures controlling pathway malleability. Upon comparison of the S6T permutants, it became evident that the various transition state ensembles, despite poorly correlated f-values, share a common structural feature. This feature is a two-strandhelix motif (i.e. two b strands docking against a single a helix) that emerges in different parts of the structure depending on how the secondary structure elements are connected (c.f. [53]). Most strikingly, this two-strandhelix motif is retained in an evolutionarily divergent S6 protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (S6A) [54]. The effect is particularly clear upon comparison with the S6T permutant P13­14. Even though the core of S6A is radically different from that of S6T P13­ 14 , the topologies of the transition state structures are almost identical (Figure 4). The only difference is that the S6A nucleus features a1 and P13­14 a2. This observation gives an interesting twist to the discussion about
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2007, 17:21­29

pathway conservation, by showing that key features of the folding nucleus can be maintained even though the f-values, as assessed on the basis of sequence position, are uncorrelated [54]. Nevertheless, the result simultaneously confirms Davidson's earlier conclusion that folds that display low f-value conservation have access to multiple pathways [8]. The addition to Davidson's rule is simply that the pathway multiplicity is linked to the multiplicity of folding nuclei within the protein structure. It also follows that the folding energy landscape can remain largely the same during the course of evolution, even if the pathways accessed on that landscape could differ as a result of sequence divergence [55]. It seems that protein folding proceeds by a carefully balanced flux over several competing channels on the folding energy landscape.

The two-strand-helix nucleus approaches the size of a structural foldon
The two-strand-helix motif is by no means unique to S6 and can be found in the folding transition states of a variety of a/b proteins, for example, human procarboxypeptidase A2 (ADA2h) [56], CI2 [57,58], U1A [12],

The two-strand-helix motif is not unique to S6 and can be found in several other a/b proteins. The dark-shaded region shows the secondary structure elements that harbour the highest f-values for (a) ADA2h [56], (b) CI2 [57,58], (c) U1A [12], (d) L23 [14], (e) CheY [59], (f) ubiquitin [60,61] and (g) ctAcP [62].

CheY [59], L23 [14], ubiquitin [60,61] and common-type acyl phosphatase (ctAcP) [62] (Figure 5). From this perspective, it is interesting to note that the size of the two-strand-helix motif corresponds to the size of the smallest globular proteins. Below this size, structures typically rely on stabilizing disulfide cross-links or coordinated metal ions (as seen in, for example, zinc fingers and toxins) [63­67]. Such a match between the size of the individual nucleation motifs and the limit of how small a cooperatively formed protein can be is quite understandable: in both cases, this size defines the least hydrophobic mass required to overcome the chain entropy and bring the folding free-energy profile downhill. Following the idea of Panchenko, Luthey-Schulten, Cole and Wolynes [68], the two-strand-helix motif can be classified as a foldon. In contrast to the original definition of a foldon, however, the nucleation motifs observed need not be contiguous in sequence.

S6 foldons share b strand 1, so when one is structured the other is automatically initiated, that is to say, coupling is mediated by the partial organization of the neighbouring cooperative subunit. If, on the other hand, the foldons are fully separated, the cooperativity would be broken and an intermediate would populate, as observed for human serum albumin (HSA) [69]. Consistent with this idea, Wolynes and co-workers [50] have recently suggested, on the basis of computational results, that the ``topological minimal folding module'' of the ankyrin repeat proteins is not a single repetitive unit, but one and a half, providing foldon overlap throughout the modular protein. A mechanistic example of how the folding cooperativity of larger proteins is efficiently controlled by the folding kinetics of their constituent domains was recently presented by Batey and Clarke for a-spectrin [70], see also [71].

Conclusions
Several lines of evidence thus suggest that pathway malleability in protein folding is determined by the composition of nucleation-competent submotifs and how they are coupled (Figure 6). If the protein structure contains only one foldon, the pathway is relatively robust and the transition state plasticity small. Such proteins can be classified as `ideal two-state folders'. When there are multiple, overlapping foldons, the folding progression can be broad and partitioned over multiple pathways. In these cases, the order of folding events is not critical and can, in principle, be altered by mutation, circular permutation and sequence variability. These are `complex two-state folders' characterised by multiple barrier maxima and

Folding cooperativity governed by foldon overlap
Finally, it remains to be understood what controls the coupling of competent nuclei in terms of folding cooperativity. According to the view presented here, proteins can be composed of multiple foldons and still fold cooperatively [1,26,54], whereas, in several other cases, structural organization into discrete foldons has been linked to multistate folding [45­49,52]. A simple answer is provided by the alternative nuclei of S6 in Figure 4 -- cooperativity is assured by foldon overlap [1]. Both of the

Schematic outline of how the protein folding process is controlled by constituent foldons and their coupling through structural overlap. (a) Ideal two-state proteins. Proteins comprising only one foldon (z0 ) are restricted to a single pathway manifested in a simple folding free-energy barrier profile and ideal V-shaped chevron plots [14,72]. (b) Complex two-state proteins. Proteins with two (or more) overlapping foldons (z0 and z00 ) have access to parallel folding channels and can display transition state shifts both along and across the folding energy landscape [1,54]. The occupancy of the high-energy intermediate separating the z0 and z00 barriers depends on the strength of folding coupling. (c) Multistate proteins. For proteins with multiple foldons that are not coupled, the global cooperativity is broken and folding intermediates are allowed to accumulate. The tuning of a protein between complex two-state and multistate behaviour is described in [69]. D, denatured state; I, intermediate state; N, native state.

distorted chevron plots. The extent to which a particular multifoldon protein will access alternative pathways varies, however, and depends on the detailed features of its folding energy landscape. Finally, if the protein structure comprises several foldons that are spatially separated, or consists of separated domains of overlapping foldons, folding intermediates are free to accumulate and folding becomes `multistate'. To this end, it can be noted that the detailed shape of the folding energy landscape controls not only the formation of structure but also the properties of that structure: by modulating cooperativity through foldon coupling, the proteins also modulate the statistical sampling of partly structured states. This is a new challenging aspect of the folding problem, with implications for both biological function and protein disease that are yet to be explored by the protein folding community.

This experimental study shows that f-value changes upon circular permutation are directly correlated with changes in sequence separation between interacting residues. 2. 3. 4.

Olofsson M, Hansson S, Hedberg L, Logan DT, Oliveberg M:  Folding of S6 structures with divergent amino-acid composition: pathway flexibility within partly overlapping foldons. J Mol Biol 2007, 375:237-248. The evolutionarily divergent S6 protein from Aquifex aeolicus retains the two-strand-helix motif of S6T, but with a different structural emphasis. The results suggest that the native state topology determines the repertoire of possible nucleation motifs, but not the specific pathways chosen by individual members of the structural family. 55. Chavez LL, Gosavi S, Jennings PA, Onuchic JN: Multiple routes  lead to the native state in the energy landscape of the betatrefoil family. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2006, 103:10254-10258. In this computational study, it is demonstrated that the global fold of the b-trefoil family determines the energy landscape, but that the routes accessed on that landscape might differ as a result of the functional requirements of individual family members. 56.
