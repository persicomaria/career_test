Abstract Protein kinase CK2 is a heteromeric enzyme with catalytic (K) and regulatory (L) subunits which form an K2 L2 K L holoenzyme and utilizes both ATP and GTP as nucleotide substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis of CK2K subunit was used K to study this capacity to use GTP. Deletion of asparagine 118 (KvN118 ) or the mutant KN118E gives a 5^6-fold increase in K apparent Km for GTP with little effect on the affinity for ATP. Mutants KN118A and KD120N did not alter significantly the Km for either nucleotide. CK2KvN118 has an apparent Ki for inosine K 5P triphosphate 5-fold higher than wild-type and is very heat P labile. These studies complement recent crystallographic data indicating a role for CK2K asparagine 118 in binding the guanine K base. z 2000 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Introduction Protein kinase CK2 is a pleiotropic and ubiquitous enzyme that phosphorylates a large number of protein substrates. Abundant evidence indicates that this enzyme plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and cell division (reviews [1^3]). Protein kinase CK2 is normally found as a heterotetramer that contains catalytic (K and KP) and regulatory (L) subunits which are present in K2 L2 , KKPL2 and K2 L2 combinations. The sequences of the catalytic subunits are highly conserved in a wide range of eukaryotic species and contain the typical 12 regions that are common to the large superfamily of protein kinase [4]. Considerable e¡ort has been made in several laboratories to study the structure and function of both subunits [5^7]. Recently, important advances in the elucidation of this problem have been made through the solution of the crystal structure of the Zea mays CK2K subunit [8] and a truncated form of the human CK2L subunit [9]. One of the special characteristics of this protein kinase is the fact that it can e¤ciently use GTP, as well as ATP, as a phosphoryl donor. The crystal form of the Z. mays CK2K subunit contained one molecule of bound ATP. Unfortunately, the nucleotide triphosphate was partially disordered so that a de¢nite picture of the binding of the purine base was not apparent [8]. This information would be highly rele-

vant to answer the question as to the structural features that allow the CK2K subunit to use GTP as e¤ciently as ATP. In an alternative approach, we reported [10]a a structural computer model of the CK2K structure based on the known structure of the cyclin-regulated protein kinase CDK2, the closest relative to CK2 in the protein kinase family. This approach allowed us to attempt to answer the question as to the lack of discrimination between the two purine nucleoside triphosphates [10]. In that work, it was concluded that a region involving Asn118 could be in close contact with the purine base, an idea that was strengthened by the fact that this asparagine is part of the sequence N117 NTD120 that closely resembles the NKXD conserved sequence present in G proteins and other GTPases and that is known to participate in the recognition of the guanine base [11,12]. Deletion of Asn118 resulted in a signi¢cant increase in the apparent Km for GTP and a smaller change in the apparent Km for ATP [10]. In this report, a comparative study of this and other mutations that substitute for Asn118 is presented, demonstrating that this amino acid is involved in determining the speci¢city for the purine base of the phosphoryl donor. In addition, it is demonstrated that deletion of Asn118 greatly a¡ects the stability of the enzyme. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials [Q-32 P]ATP and GTP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products and dephospho-Lcasein, protease inhibitors, nucleotides inosine 5P triphosphate (ITP), XTP and GTP were obtained from Sigma. NTA-agarose was from Invitrogen. Nucleotide sequencing was performed using a 377 ABI automatic sequencer and oligonucleotides were synthesized by an ABI DNA synthesizer in the Oligopeptido Core Facility of the University of Chile. 2.2. Mutants of protein kinase CK2K subunit The deletion mutant CK2KvN118 was generated by overlapping primer extension PCR [13] using clones of CK2K in vector pT7-7 [14,15]. The initial ampli¢cation reactions to generate the two overlapping fragments used oligonucleotide pairs (5P-TTCGAACATGTCAACACAGATTTTAA-3P) and the T7 primer (5P-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3P), and for the second fragment (5P-TTAAAAATCTGTGTTGACATGTTCGAA-3P) with the reverse T7 primer (5PATTGGTAACTGTCAGACCAAG-3P). In the ¢nal ampli¢cation reaction, the T7 and reverse T7 primers were used with the mixture of the products of the ¢rst two PCR reactions. The products were digested with NdeI and SalI and subcloned into pT7-7H6 which contains a six histidine tag to facilitate the puri¢cation [15]. Mutants N118A, N118E and D120N were prepared as given for vN118 using the same T7 primers and the appropriate oligonucleotides for the initial overlap extension PCR reactions were as follows:

364 mutant N118A: 5P-AACATGTCAACGCTACAGATT-3P and 5PAATCTGTTAGCGTTGACATGTT-3P, mutant N118E: 5P-AACATGTCAACGAAACAGATT-3P and 5P-AATCTGTTTCGTTGACATGTT-3P, mutant D120N: 5P-CAACAATACAAATTTTAAGCAGT-3P and 5P-ACTGCTTAAAATTTGTATTGTTG-3P. To generate the double mutation vN118,D120N, mutant vN118 was used as template with the following primers: 5P-GTCAACACAAATTTTAAGCAG-3P and 5P-CTGCTTAAAATTTGTGTTGAC-3P with a similar procedure as given above. In all cases, the complete nucleotide sequence of each recombinant clone was con¢rmed by sequencing using a 377 ABI automatic sequencer. 2.3. Preparation of mutant CK2K recombinant proteins The wild-type and mutant CK2K were cloned in vector pT7-7H6 and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-DE3 after induction at 37³ with 1 mM IPTG as previously described [15]. The bacterial pellet was lysed in 1/10 of the volume of the culture in a bu¡er containing 50 mM sodium phosphate bu¡er pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20 mM L-mercaptoethanol and 0.5% Triton. In addition, the bu¡er contained a mixture of protease inhibitors including 4 Wg/ml of pepstatin, leupeptin and antipain, 5 Wg/ml of aprotinin and 1 mM PMSF. Immediately after lysis, recombinant CK2L subunit, prepared as described previously [15], was added (8 nmol per l of culture) to stabilize the activity of the mutant CK2K preparations. After centrifugation of the extract for 30 min at 6000Ug, the His-tagged proteins were puri¢ed from the soluble fraction using a Ni -NTA-agarose column as indicated by the manufacturer. The eluted fractions were analyzed for their catalytic activity and the presence of proteins of the expected molecular mass by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. 2.4. Protein kinase CK2 assay The standard assay mixture contained in a ¢nal volume of 30 Wl: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml dephospho-Lcasein and 50 WM of either [Q-32 P]ATP (1300 cmp/pmol) or [Q-32 P]GTP (2000 counts per min (cpm)/pmol). 5 pmol of CK2K wild-type or mutant K subunits was used per assay and, in the case of the wild-type enzyme, an equimolar amount of recombinant CK2L [15] was added to the preparation to give maximal stimulation of the basal activity of CK2K (usually 6^8-fold stimulation). The maximal stimulation by CK2L was con¢rmed by titration of the catalytic activity to assure the presence of the heterotetrameric K2 L2 form. In the case of the recombinant CK2K mutants, the CK2L subunit was added during the preparation of the expressed protein, as described above. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at 30³C and terminated by the absorption of an aliquot to Whatman P81 paper, followed by washing three times in 75 mM phosphoric acid. Results are expressed as pmol of [32 P]phosphate incorporated into protein substrate per min. Initial velocity measurements for determination of the apparent Km were performed under the standard conditions except for the varied nucleotide substrate concentrations (ATP or GTP, 10^500 WM) and varying the radiolabel between 400 and 10 000 cmp/pmol. Controls were performed in the absence of enzyme for each level of radioactivity. Apparent Km values were determined from Lineweaver^Burk double reciprocal analysis and using the program Microcal Origin 2.8. Ki values were obtained from the slopes observed at the di¡erent inhibitor concentrations. All reactions were performed in duplicate and the data represent results obtained from 3^5 individual experiments.

Using the standard assay described in Section 2 and 50 WM [Q-32 P]ATP as labeled nucleotide substrate, activities of wild-type (F) and vN118 mutant holoenzyme (a) were measured in the presence of varying levels of unlabeled GTP. The 100% values of incorporation of [32 P]phosphate into substrate casein were 48 pmol per min for wild-type enzyme and 17 pmol per min for the mutant.

3. Results Mutants of recombinant CK2K subunit were prepared as indicated in Section 2. Due to the extreme thermal lability of the mutant in which the asparagine 118 has been deleted, the regulatory L subunit of CK2, which in a great measure stabilizes the enzyme, was added immediately after lysis to all the bacterial extracts that expressed the K subunit mutants. After puri¢cation of the recombinant reconstituted holoenzymes through Ni -NTA-agarose that retains the histidine-tagged proteins, their apparent Km values for ATP and GTP were determined. As had been shown previously [10], the deletion of Asn118 (CK2KvN118 ) causes an important increase in the apparent Km for GTP but a considerably lower increment in the Km value for ATP (Table 1). The mutation of Asn118 to alanine (CK2KN118A ) does not a¡ect the a¤nity for either nucleotide. Similarly, the mutation of Asp120 to asparagine (CK2KD120N ) does not a¡ect signi¢cantly the Km values. On the other hand, the mutation of the Asn118 to glutamic acid (CD2KN118E ) causes a 6-fold increment in the Km for GTP without a¡ecting at all the apparent Km for ATP. The double mutant with deleted Asn118 and mutated Asp120 to Asn (CK2KvN118YD120N ) has properties very similar to the single deletion of Asn118 . The di¡erent a¤nities of the CK2KvN118 for the nucleoside triphosphates were also studied through competition experiments using purine nucleoside triphosphates. Fig. 1 shows the inhibition of the CK2 activity by the presence of non-radioactive GTP, when [Q-32 P]ATP is used as substrate. It is clearly observed that GTP is a weaker inhibitor when the CK2KvN118 is used as compared to the wild-type, con¢rming the lower a¤nity of this mutant for GTP. Kinetic studies on the inhibition by ITP of both the wildtype and the CK2KvN118 mutant using GTP as a substrate (Fig. 2) demonstrated that ITP, as expected, is a competitive inhibitor. These experiments allowed us to calculate the ap-

parent Ki for ITP which for the wild-type is 75 WM, while for the CK2KvN118 , it is 360 WM. Similar experiments using XTP as inhibitor showed that CK2KvN118 activity is likewise less a¡ected than wild-type enzyme by this purine analogue (not shown). Our previous observation as to the extreme lability of CK2KvN118 led us to study the e¡ect of exposing the holoenzymes of these mutants to preincubation at 45³C. Fig. 3 shows that, while the CK2KN118A , CK2KN118E mutants behave very much as the wild-type enzyme, the CK2KvN118 is much more labile, reaching complete inactivation after 10 min at this temperature. 4. Discussion The results presented here extend our previous observations that indicated that Asn118 is involved in determining the unusual nucleotide speci¢city of protein kinase CK2 [10]. The function of this amino acid residue was examined considering that a computational model of CK2K constructed on the basis of the tridimensional structure indicated that Asn118 might be in close proximity to the nucleotide base. Additional interest was suggested by the fact that this residue is part of a se-

quence (N117 NTD120 ) which is analogous to the NKXD sequence that has been shown to play a critical role in the speci¢city for GTP of G proteins and other known GTPases [11,12]. The hypothesis that this sequence plays a similar role in CK2 as it does in G proteins has been discarded by the experiments presented above. In G proteins and in GTPases, such as protein synthesis elongation factors and transducin, the aspartic acid that is part of that sequence plays a key role in stabilizing the guanine moiety through hydrogen bonding with the N1 nitrogen and the amino group in ring position 2. The change of aspartic acid to asparagine drastically modi¢es the nucleotide speci¢city of these proteins [11]. On the other hand, in the present case, mutation of the equivalent Asp120 to Asn in CK2K did not a¡ect its a¤nity for GTP or ATP and the double mutant CK2KvN118YD120N has speci¢city properties similar to that of the CK2vN118 single mutant. The observation that the CK2KN118A behaves as the wildtype suggests that the Asn side chain may not be playing a major role for GTP usage, whereas the observation that the CK2KN118E behaves as the deletion mutant that eliminates Asn118 in selectively lowering the a¤nity for GTP indicates that an acidic side chain in that position can disturb the function that the backbone of Asn118 may play in GTP recognition. Not surprisingly, the lower a¤nity of CK2KvN118 for GTP extends to other purine nucleotides, in particular ITP. The Asn118 deletion raises the apparent Ki for ITP from 75 WM to 360 WM. It is interesting that the CK2KvN118 and CK2KN118E which have similar properties with regard to nucleotide speci¢city, but they di¡er markedly in their response to heat treatment. Thus the deletion of Asn118 causes a dramatic labilization of the enzyme while the substitution of asparagine for glutamic acid gives a protein with heat stability similar to the wild-type. In the computational model, Asn118 appears as an `insertion segment' that changes the local structure of the nucleotide pocket when compared to other protein kinases [10]. This apparent distortion would seem to be important in maintaining the stability of the native enzyme.

When this manuscript was in preparation, a publication by Nie¢nd et al. appeared [16]. This work is crucial to our understanding of the nucleotide speci¢city of CK2K since it solved the crystal structure of the K subunit bound to non-hydrolyzable analogues of ATP and GTP in the presence of Mg2 . This work demonstrates that CK2 uses both purine bases by allowing a displacement of the position of the guanine base relative to the adenine position along the backbone of the enzyme and that water molecules play key roles in the ¢t of the guanine base. Relevant to the work presented here, the results of Nie¢nd et al. [16] demonstrate that Asn118 is hydrogen-bonded through its backbone nitrogen to the backbone carbonyl of valine 16, a link that is especially important for binding of the guanine base and which is not present in other kinases. In addition, it is found that the side chain of Asn118 is linked to the ribose-2PO of GTP through a water molecule. Our results on the involvement of Asn118 in the determination of the nucleotide speci¢city and the e¤ciency of GTP usage by holoenzyme CK2 complement and are fully in accord with the crystallographic data. There has been some debate as to the physiological meaning of this almost unique capacity of CK2 to use e¤ciently GTP as a phosphoryl donor. Although this matter has not been resolved, the availability of mutants such as CK2KvN118 and CK2KN118E which are almost normal for ATP usage but have a much lower a¤nity for GTP could be very useful in trying to address this question.
