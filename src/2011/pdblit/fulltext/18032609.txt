ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters are responsible for the export of a wide variety of cell-surface glycoconjugates in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These include the Oantigenic polysaccharide (O-PS) portion of lipopolysaccharide, a crucial virulence determinant in Gram-negative pathogens. O-PSs are synthesized by one of two fundamentally different pathways. Escherichia coli O serotypes O8 and O9a provide the prototype systems for studying O-PS export via ABC transporters. The transporter is composed of the transmembrane component Wzm and the nucleotide-binding component Wzt. Although the N-terminal domain of Wzt is a conventional ABC protein, the C-terminal domain of Wzt (C-Wzt) is a unique structural element that determines the specificity of the transporter for either the O8 or O9a O-PS. We show here that the two domains of Wzt can function when expressed as separate polypeptides; both are essential for export. In vitro, C-Wzt binds its cognate O-PS by recognizing a residue located at the nonreducing end of the polymer. The crystal structure of C-WztO9a is reported here and reveals a sandwich with an immunoglobulin-like topology that contains the O-PSbinding pocket. Substrate interactions with nucleotide-binding domains have been demonstrated in an ABC exporter previously. However, to our knowledge substrate binding by a discrete, cytoplasmic accessory domain in an extended nucleotide-binding domain polypeptide has not previously been demonstrated. Elucidation of the substrate-recognition system involved in O-PS export provides insight into the mechanism that coordinates polymer biosynthesis, termination, and export.

TP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters use the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to transport molecules across membranes. Their ABC domains are evolutionarily conserved and are found in every living cell. The core ABC transporter consists of four domains: two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The NBDs contain the conserved ABC sequence motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Crystal structures are available for a number of NBDs as well as four complete ABC transporters (1, 2). These structures have provided valuable information that combined with biochemical data has led to working models for the mechanism of transport (2­4). ABC transporters are responsible for the export of a wide variety of glycans in cell-surface glycoconjugates from Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria. Examples include glycans from glycoproteins, teichoic acids, capsular polysaccharides, and the O-antigenic polysaccharide (O-PS) portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS comprises a major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (5). LPS can be divided into three structural and functional regions: lipid A, core oligosaccharide and O-PS. Synthesis of the lipid A and core oligosaccharide portion of the LPS molecule occurs separately from the O-PS. The biosynthesis pathways merge at the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, completing the LPS molecule before transport to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (6). O-PS is a repeating-unit polysaccharide that gives

rise to 180 O serotypes in Escherichia coli and serves in a protective role (7). O-PSs are synthesized by one of two principal pathways that involve fundamentally different processes; both are widely distributed in bacterial species (6). The polymannose O-PSs of E. coli serotypes O8 and O9a serve as the prototype systems for studying synthesis and export of O-PS via ABC transporters (Fig. 1). Polymer synthesis takes place at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane and is terminated through the action of WbdD (8). The WbdD proteins in serotypes O8 and O9a share a coiled-coil motif and a methyltransferase domain but they differ in a kinase domain confined to the O9a protein. In E. coli O8, WbdD transfers a methyl group to the nonreducing terminus of the O-PS, whereas in E. coli O9a WbdD is responsible for consecutive phosphorylation and methylation of the nascent O-PS (8) (Fig. 1B). In each serotype, WbdD activity terminates polymerization and is required for O-PS export across the inner membrane via an ABC transporter (8). The O-PS transporter consists of the TMD protein Wzm and the NBD protein Wzt. The Wzt homologs from E. coli O8 and O9a are proteins of 404 and 431 aa, respectively, and are longer than typical ABC transporter NBD proteins (Fig. 1C). Previously, we showed that the Wzm homologs are functionally interchangeable between E. coli O8 and O9a, whereas the Wzt homologs are not. The ABC transporters are specific for their cognate O-PSs, and the Wzt homologs dictate this specificity (9). The N-terminal region of Wzt (N-Wzt) contains all of the characteristic sequence motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and is highly conserved between the two proteins. However, the sequence of an extended C-terminal region (CWzt) is relatively less conserved. Chimeric Wzt proteins were used to identify C-Wzt as the element responsible for dictating substrate specificity (9). We show here that N- and C-Wzt can function in trans and both are required for transporter function. C-WztO8 and C-WztO9a bind their cognate O-PSs in vitro through recognition of the nonreducing terminal modification added by WbdD. We also report the crystal structure of C-Wzt from E. coli O9a and identify a previously uncharacterized O-PS-binding region. Results

The N-Wzt homologs were cloned with N-terminal His6 tags. C-WztO9a was cloned with an N-terminal His10-tag. C-WztO8 was cloned with a C-terminal His10 tag. Proteinase K-digested whole-cell lysates from E. coli O9a (A) and O8 (B) were separated by SDS/PAGE and the LPS visualized by silver stain. O-PS-substituted lipid A-core appears as a ladder pattern on SDS/PAGE, where each successive rung on the ladder represents an additional O-repeat unit on the LPS molecule.

Fig. 1. O-PS synthesis and export by an ABC-transporter-dependent pathway. (A) Synthesis takes place at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane and begins with the WecA-mediated transfer of an N-acetylglucosamine-1phosphate to form the undecaprenol pyrophosphate-linked intermediate (step 1) (40, 41). WbdC, WbdB, and WbdA are mannosyltransferases that synthesize the O-PS through sequential transfer of mannose residues from GDP-mannose to the nonreducing end of the growing chain (step 2) (40). Chain elongation is terminated by the addition of nonreducing terminal modifications by WbdD (step 3) (8). These modifications are required for O-PS export across the inner membrane by an ABC transporter composed of the TMD protein Wzm and the NBD protein Wzt (step 4) (8). At the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, O-PS is ligated to the lipid A-core portion of LPS by WaaL (step 5), before its transport to the outer membrane.

was monitored. Fig. 3 shows that O9a O-PS export can only be achieved when C-WztO9a is expressed in trans with its cognate N-WztO9a. Similarily, O8 O-PS export can only be achieved when the two domains of WztO8 are expressed in trans. These experiments extend our previous finding by establishing that the role of C-Wzt in determining serotype specificity is maintained when the domains are expressed independently.

(O8 residues 1­267; O9a 1­275) and C-Wzt (O8 residues 245­ 404; O9a 255­431) were cloned in separate plasmids and tested for their ability to restore O-PS export in chromosomal wzt mutants. Fig. 2A shows that coexpression of the two domains of WztO9a restored cell-surface expression of O-PS in an O9a wzt mutant, whereas expression of either domain alone did not. Similar results were obtained when the two domains of WztO8 were expressed in an E. coli O8 wzt mutant (Fig. 2B), albeit with a lower efficiency of export. These data confirm that: (i) the two domains of Wzt are able to fold independently and function in trans; and (ii) the extended C-terminal domain of Wzt is essential for O-PS transport. Analysis of chimeric Wzt proteins established that C-Wzt is required for transport specificity. However, efficient transport appeared to require additional interactions between N-Wzt and its cognate Wzm protein (9). Therefore, to test whether the C-Wzt domains could function with the heterologous N-Wzt domains, a plasmid was constructed for each serotype containing sequences encoding Wzm with its cognate N-Wzt domain. These proteins were coexpressed with each C-Wzt homolog in the appropriate wzm-wzt chromosomal mutant and O-PS expression

is able to interact with O-PS directly, purified serotype O8 or O9a LPS was incubated with either C-WztO8 or C-WztO9a. The His10-tagged protein in the reaction mixture was then bound to nickel-affinity chromatography resin and the elution fractions were examined for the presence of LPS and protein (Fig. 4). Purified O8 LPS coeluted with C-WztO8, whereas O9a LPS did not. Conversely, purified LPS from serotype O9a coeluted with C-WztO9a, whereas O8 LPS did not. These results are consistent with a direct and specific interaction between C-Wzt and its cognate O-PS. SDS/PAGE of the purified C-Wzt homologs (Fig. 4) consistently showed the presence of two protein species of different apparent molecular masses (C-WztO8, 19 kDa and 22 kDa; C-WztO9a, 21 kDa and 26 kDa). The smaller bands correlate with the predicted molecular masses of 19,290 Da and 21,319 Da for C-WztO8 and C-WztO9a, respectively. The larger bands seen by SDS/PAGE appear to be forms of the same polypeptide with altered mobility. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed only a single molecular mass species corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of the C-Wzt derivative (data not shown). All of the bands were recognized by anti-histidine tag antibodies and both protein species in C-WztO9a preparations also reacted with

C-WztO9a specific antiserum (data not shown). Furthermore, the two protein species from each serotype were identified by in-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as C-Wzt (data not shown). The addition of nonreducing terminal modifications by WbdD to the O8 and O9a O-PSs is required for their export across the inner membrane (8). To test the hypothesis that these modifications are required for O-PS binding by C-WztO9a, modified (phosphorylated and methylated) and unmodified polymer was synthesized and radiolabeled in vitro. The source of enzyme was membrane preparations from E. coli O9a and a chromosomal wbdD mutant, respectively. The purified radiolabeled products were then used in the binding assay with C-WztO9a. Fig. 4 E and F show that, whereas a portion of the modified O-PS coeluted with C-WztO9a, the unmodified O-PS did not. Therefore, the nonreducing terminal modifications on the O9a polymer are required for its binding by C-WztO9a. The amount of input radiolabeled O-PS bound by C-WztO9a in this assay is low compared with the experiment using intact LPS (Fig. 4D). This likely reflects the existence of intact LPS in micelles, which would amplify the signal from the binding of a single LPS molecule by C-Wzt. The requirement of WbdD for O-PS export (8) is therefore explained by the essential role of the O-PS nonreducing terminal modifications in polymer recognition by C-Wzt.

The structure of C-WztO9a was solved by x-ray crystallography. It was crystallized in space group P42212, and its structure was determined at 1.3 Å resolution [Fig. 5A; supporting information (SI) Text]. C-WztO9a is organized as a dimer with the interface between monomers stabilized by the exchange of 9 and the continuation of a single hydrophobic core through both monomers. The monomer structure revealed a -sandwich with a topology characteristic of an immunoglobulin fold. Database searches using the structure of C-WztO9a by DALI (10) revealed multiple significant matches with known Ig-fold proteins includCuthbertson et al.

ing a number of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) (SI Text). Ig folds are found in a number of CBMs involved in polysaccharide binding by carbohydrate-active enzymes (www. cazy.com). Comparison of C-WztO9a with the structural homologs revealed by DALI shows high similarity through the core sheets (SI Fig. 6). However, the structures diverge throughout the loop regions. The surface of C-WztO9a defined by strands 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 forms a distinctly concave groove, bordered by the 4- 5 and 7- 8 loops and was investigated as the putative O9a O-PSbinding surface. This surface is well conserved among O9a-like Wzt homologs (Fig. 5B; SI Text) and contains six surfaceexposed aromatic residues (Fig. 5C). Residues of this type are commonly used in CBMs to bind carbohydrates by stacking with the sugar rings (11). Two adjacent glycine residues (G333 and G387) are situated in the middle of this sheet and create a deeper pocket, which is bordered by V331, L335, N348, R402, Y404, and W418. R402 is unique to O9a-like Wzt homologs. The absence of phosphate at the terminus of the O8 O-PS is consistent with a possible role for R402 in phosphate recognition in WztO9a. Repeated attempts to crystallize C-WztO8 for comparison have been unsuccessful.

Figures were prepared by using PyMol (www.pymol.org). Additional data are presented in SI Text.

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the contribution of specific residues to O-PS binding and export. Mutations were made in constructs expressing full-length WztO9a and examined for the ability to complement a chromosomal wzt mutant. The same mutations were also made in plasmids expressing C-WztO9a, and the resulting proteins were purified and tested for O9a LPS binding in vitro. These data are summarized in Fig. 5D (also see SI Text). Mutations V331A, L335A, F343A, and F350A were found to have little or no detectable effect on O-PS export in vivo and were able to bind LPS in vitro. Other mutations (W286A, N348A, R402A, Y404A, D405A) caused a significant reduction of O-PS export in vivo. These mutants did not bind detectable amounts of LPS in vitro. Failure of these single-residue mutants to completely abolish O-PS export in vivo could reflect O-PS interactions involving multiple amino acid residues (or multiple binding sites) in Wzt. Additional O-PSbinding sites within C-Wzt with low affinity, or interactions with short half-lives, would not be revealed by the binding assay. Two mutations, G333Q and G387Q, were predicted to block the O-PS-binding pocket by the addition of a relatively bulky hydrophilic group. These mutations eliminated any detectable O-PS export in vivo and were not able to bind LPS in vitro, establishing that access to this pocket is critical for substrate binding and export. Two mutations, K337A and W418A, caused a reduction in O-PS export in vivo but were still able to bind LPS in vitro, indicating that these residues play a role unrelated to O-PS binding. Discussion The addition of nonreducing terminal modifications by WbdD to the E. coli O8 and O9a O-PSs regulates O-PS chain length and

is required for O-PS export by the Wzm-Wzt transporter (8). It is now clear that the terminal modifications are critical for polymer binding by C-Wzt providing insight into the mechanism coordinating polymer biosynthesis and export. The overall process generates a defined O-PS chain length, which is critical for the function of O-PSs in virulence (12). However, it is still unclear how WbdD activity is itself regulated. Overexpression of WbdD reduces O-PS chain length in serotypes O8 and O9a (8), indicating that the stoichiometry of the various biosynthesis components, and their potential interactions, may both be important in determining chain length. However, details of the process have not been resolved. Nonreducing terminal modifications have been identified on a number of O-PSs exported by ABC transporters, as well as on a number of Gram-positive S-layer glycans (SI Table 2). The gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of these polysaccharides encode a Wzt homolog with an extended C-terminal domain, indicating that recognition of terminal modifications may be widespread in polysaccharides exported by ABC transporters. The structure of C-WztO9a shows a -sandwich with an Ig topology. Comparable topology is seen in a number of CBMs, which serve to bring catalytic domains into close proximity with their carbohydrate substrates. CBMs are currently divided into 49 families based on sequence similarity (www.cazy.org). Available structures indicate that a -sandwich fold is the most common fold seen in CMBs and at least seven CBM families (CBM 9, 20, 25, 26, 31, 33, and 34) have an Ig-like topology (13). Specific recognition of the terminal sugars of polysaccharides has been demonstrated in CBMs, resembling the situation in C-WztO9a. For example, the CBM of Thermotoga maritima xylanase 10A specifically recognizes the reducing-terminal sugCuthbertson et al.

ars of xylans and cellulose (14, 15). Similarily, the CBMs of laminarinase from Bacillus halodurans, and -agarase from Saccharophagus degradans, specifically recognize the nonreducing terminus of their carbohydrate substrates (16, 17). The current classification in the CAZy database does not include transport proteins. However, the modular nature of WztO9a may define C-WztO9a as a new class and application of CBMs. In addition to the four core domains, many ABC transporters contain additional accessory domains. These include domains that are extracytoplasmic or membrane-embedded, as well as regulatory and catalytic domains in the cytoplasm (18). The cytoplasmic regulatory domain of MalK is located C-terminal to the NBD and interacts with the transcriptional regulator MalT (19) as well as with enzyme IIAGlc to effect inducer exclusion (20). Based on the structures of MalK (21­23) and complete ABC transporters (1), C-Wzt is potentially located at a significant distance from Wzm, being separated by N-Wzt. An unresolved question concerns the role (if any) of Wzm itself in substrate recognition. Substrate-binding sites are located in the TMD component of many ABC efflux systems, with the eukaryotic multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein serving as a wellstudied example (24, 25). The current data suggest that Wzm is not involved in O-PS specificity but does not rule out its possible recognition of features present in both O8 and O9a polymers. HlyB and PtrD provide examples of substrate binding by ABC exporter NBD proteins (26­28). They differ from Wzt in that binding is achieved by the core NBD rather than by an accessory domain. The properties of the K337A and W418A mutants in WztO9a indicate that these residues play a role in O-PS export unrelated to O-PS binding. One possible interpretation is that these residues are involved in an interaction with N-Wzt as part of the export cycle. In this scenario, the use of the same face of C-Wzt would be used for O-PS recognition and interaction with N-Wzt and is consistent with our finding that only one face of C-WztO9a is conserved. N-Wzt interaction with the predicted O-PS binding face of C-Wzt would allow a symmetric interaction, with the 2-fold axes of the two domains aligned and coincidental. An intriguing aspect to this model is the possibility that the O-PS is bound between C-Wzt and the NBD core. The possible involvement of the core NBD (N-Wzt) in additional O-PS interactions will require further study. However, the system described here provides an example of substrate binding (imparting substrate specificity) by an accessory domain of an ABC exporter and may define a class of ABC-transporter accessory domain. Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Plasmids. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in SI Text and SI Table 7. Wzt proteins and their domains were cloned in pBAD vectors (29) to take advantage of the vector's arabinose-inducible promoter. LPS Detection. LPS was examined by SDS/PAGE and silver

manA wbdD). The in vitro reactions were carried out by using GDP-[14C]mannose to label the repeating-unit portion of the O-PS and S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine to label the nonreducing terminal modification (if present). Membranes were prepared as described (9), and protein content was determined by using the BioRad DC protein assay kit. Reactions were carried out for 1 h at 37°C in 2-ml volumes containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 10 M ATP, 606 nM GDP[14C]mannose (260 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 M S-[methyl- 3 H]adenosylmethionine (69.5 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the membrane equivalent of 2 mg of total protein. After the reaction, membranes were collected by centrifugation for 1 h at 70,000 g at 4°C and washed in 20 ml of water to remove residual radiolabeled substrate. The washed pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of water, and an equal volume of 90% phenol was added. Extraction was performed at 68°C. This procedure liberates the O-PS from the undecaprenollinked intermediates into the aqueous phase that was collected (33). The resulting dialyzed O-PS preparation was concentrated by using a Microcon YM-3 column (3,000 MWCO; Millipore). Further details are provided in SI Text.
Purification of C-Wzt. C-WztO8 (amino acids 245­ 404) and C-WztO9a (amino acids 255­431) were purified from E. coli Top10. E. coli Top10 does not express O-PS, ensuring that the purified protein would not be contaminated. Both proteins were purified as His10-tagged derivatives with the tag present at the C terminus of C-WztO8 and the N terminus of C-WztO9a. Cells were grown at 37°C, and expression of C-Wzt was induced during midexponential growth through the addition of 0.3% (wt/vol) arabinose and continued growth for 2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5 containing 100 mM NaCl) and cells lysed by sonication. The cell lysate was cleared by successive centrifugation steps at 15,000 g for 15 min and 70,000 g for 1 h. His10-tagged C-Wzt proteins were then purified from the supernatant by using HIS-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma). The column was washed with buffer A containing 10 mM and then 25 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted in buffer A containing 200 mM imidazole. Elution fractions were monitored by SDS/PAGE. The pooled fractions containing C-Wzt were desalted by using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted into buffer A. The desalted protein was concentrated by using a VIVASPIN 15R column (10,000 MWCO; VIVASCIENCE) to a final concentration of 28 mg/ml for C-WztO8 and 17­21 mg/ml for C-WztO9a.

staining (30) from proteinase-K-digested whole-cell lysates prepared by the method of Hitchcock and Brown (31). Alternatively, cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy to detect surface expressed O-PS (SI Text).
Purification of LPS and O-PS. LPS was isolated from E. coli O8 and

E. coli O9a isolates by using the hot aqueous phenol method (32) (SI Text). Although nonterminated O-PS is made in a wbdD mutant, it is not exported and remains linked to the undecaprenol carrier in the inner membrane (8). Therefore, to assess the role of nonreducing terminal modifications in polymer binding by CWzt, the appropriate radioactive polymers were synthesized in vitro. The source of enzyme was membrane preparations from E. coli O9a (CWG634; manA) and its wbdD mutant (CWG635;

In Vitro LPS- and O-PS-Binding Assay. In vitro binding assays were carried out in 500- l reactions in buffer A containing 500 g of purified C-Wzt and either purified LPS (150 g) or purified radiolabeled O-PS (equivalent of 67.7 pmol of mannose for the modified O-PS and 159 pmol for the unmodified O-PS). Reactions were performed for 1 h at room temperature on a rotary shaker. HIS-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (250 l, washed in 1 ml of buffer A; Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture, and incubation was continued for 1 h. The HIS-Select gel was collected by centrifugation at 16,100 g, and the supernatant was removed. The resin was then washed twice in 500 l of buffer A when LPS was used as the binding substrate or three times when radiolabeled O-PS was used to reach background in the washes. C-Wzt was eluted in 500 l of buffer A containing 200 mM imidazole, and the elution step was repeated two more times. Radioactivity in the O-PS-binding assays was detected by liquid scintillation counting. LPS or O-PS alone did not interact with the chromatography resin without C-Wzt (data not shown).

Crystals grew up to 600 m over the course of 1­4 weeks. Crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K after excess mother liquor had been displaced by paratone N oil (Hampton Research). Data were collected to 1.3 Å resolution at beamline IMCA-CAT ID17 at the Advanced Photon Source. Data collection and phasing statistics are summarized in SI Table 3. Data were processed by using HKL2000 (34). SAD phases were derived from a crystal that had been soaked in 10 mM HgCl2 for 1 hour and frozen without back-soaking. Peak searching of the Bijvoet difference map with Solve (35) found two strong Hg peaks, yielding an initial map with FOM 0.38, which was used to obtain a partial backbone trace for the structure with Resolve (36). This partial trace was used as a starting point for ArpWarp to build out most of the structure by using the native data set

(37). Subsequent rebuilding steps were performed in XtalView (38), and refined by using Refmac5 in the CCP4 package (39). In the final stages of refinement, anisotropy in the atomic temperature factors were partially modeled by using TLS methods with the chains being partitioned into sequential five residue groups. No NCS restraints were used during refinement. The entire structure was traced with the exception of residues N-terminal to M264 in each chain. Refinement and final model parameters are described in SI Table 4.
