Abstract ClpAP is a barrel-like complex consisting of hexameric rings of the ClpA ATPase stacked on the double heptameric ring of ClpP peptidase. ClpA has two AAA+ domains (Dl and D2) and a 153-residue N-domain. Substrate proteins bind to the distal surface of ClpA and are unfolded and translocated axially into ClpP. To gain insight into the functional architecture of ClpA in the ATPcS  state, we have determined its structure at 12 A resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. The resulting model has two tiers, corresponding to rings of Dl and D2 domains: oddly, there is no sign of the N-domains in the density map. However, they were detected as faint diffuse density distal to the Dl tier in a difference image between wild-type ClpAP and a mutant lacking the N-domain. This region is also accentuated in a variance map of ClpAP and in a difference imaging experiment with ClpAP complexed with ClpS, a 12 kDa protein that binds to the N-domain. These observations demonstrate that the N-domains are highly mobile. From molecular  modeling, we identify their median position and estimate that they undergo fluctuations of at least 30 A. We discuss the implications of these observations for the role of N-domains in substrate binding: either they effect an initial transient binding, relaying substrate to a second site on the Dl tier where unfolding ensues, or they may serve as an entropic brush to clear the latter site of non-specifically bound ligands or substrates bound in non-productive complexes.

1. Introduction Clp proteases are macromolecular machines that intercept and degrade defective or foreign proteins inside cells (reviews: Dougan et al., 2002a; Wickner et al., 1999). Each such machine has a peptidase component and an ATPase component. In Escherichia coli, the peptidase ClpP partners either ClpA or ClpX ATPase; ClpQ (HslV), another peptidase, partners ClpY (HslU). In general, the ATPase is responsible for recognizing, binding, unfolding, and translocating protein substrates into the digestion chamber inside the peptidase. Substrate recognition and binding require only ATP-binding but not ATP-hydrolysis. ATP-hydrolysis is needed

only for unfolding and translocating substrates (Hoskins et al., 2000). Clp ATPases belong to the AAAþ family, an extensive and functionally diverse family of proteins united by common sequence motifs (Neuwald et al., 2000) and a shared subunit fold and mode of nucleotide binding (Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001). ClpA has two AAAþ domains, as do its homologs ClpB and ClpC, whereas ClpX and ClpY (HslU) have only one. The D2 domain of ClpA has been found to have 5- to 10-fold higher ATPase activity than Dl (Singh and Maurizi, 1994), suggesting that the domains are functionally differentiated, one being primarily responsible for oligomerization and the other for mechanochemical transduction. Similar ideas have been advanced for other two-domain AAA+ proteins (Matveeva et al., 1997; Zakalskiy et al., 2002). Many AAA proteins have additional, non-ATPase, domains, often located at their N-termini. In the Clp

family, ClpA and ClpB have similar 153-residue N-domains; ClpX has a 61-residue, zinc-binding, N-domain; ClpB has a domain of 106 residues between Dl and D2; and ClpQ has an ``intermediate domain'' (I-domain) of 110 residues inserted in its AAA domain. Some such domains bind small adaptor proteins that mediate interactions with specific substrates or other regulatory factors (Dougan et al., 2002a). In fully assembled Clp proteases, ATPase rings stack axially on the peptidase, itself a bipolar double ring with a central cavity (Kessel et al., 1995). In ClpAP, the ClpA rings are hexamers and the ClpP rings are heptamers, invoking a symmetry mismatch at their interface (Beuron et al., 1998). A similar arrangement prevails with ClpXP. The crystal structure of the ClpP tetradecamer has been determined (Wang et al., 1997), and recently, the crystal structure of ClpA has been determined (Guo et al., 2002), revealing both AAAþ domains and the Ndomain. The protein was crystallized in the presence of ADP, in which state ClpA is in a monomer­dimer equilibrium in solution (Maurizi et al., 1994), and it was solved as a monomer whence a model for the hexamer was derived. However, there are as yet no high resolution structures for ClpA hexamers or ClpAP complexes. In earlier work, we characterized the ClpA hexamer  by cryo-EM at 28 A resolution (Beuron et al., 1998) and determined by proteolytic protection experiments that it is the apical surface of the D2 ring that makes contact with ClpP (Singh et al., 2001). We also studied substrate binding and translocation by ClpAP and established that the model substrate, RepA (Wickner et al., 1994), initially binds to some, as yet undefined, site on the distal surface of ClpA and is subsequently unfolded and reptates along an axial pathway (Ishikawa et al., 2000). Within this overall picture, several key questions concerning early stages of the pathway have yet to be answered. To which parts of ClpA do substrates bind? Do all substrates bind to the same site or are there several reception areas? Is there a pathway of binding sites to which substrates are successively transferred? How is the stoichiometry of substrate binding (e.g., one RepA dimer per ClpA hexamer--Pak and Wickner, 1997) to be explained? How and where is substrate unfolding and translocation initiated? And what is the role of the N-domains? On the latter point, there is some fragmentary information: it has been observed that binding of the adaptor ClpS, a 106-residue polypeptide, to the N-domain favors the degradation of aggregated proteins over soluble proteins (Dougan et al., 2002). However, if the N-domain is deleted, ClpA remains competent to degrade casein as well as GFP-SsrA (Dougan et al., 2002; Lo et al., 2001; Singh et al., 2001). In this study, we undertook a more detailed cryo-EM analysis of ClpA with the aim of examining the molecular architecture of the ATPcS-stabilized hexamer in solution. We were particularly interested in the dispo-

sition of the N-domains in light of their putative roles in the binding and processing of substrates.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Protein purification ClpA and ClpP proteins were purified as described previously (Maurizi et al., 1994). The ClpAD153 mutant, which lacks residues 1­153, was expressed according to Singh et al. (2001). ClpAP 2:1 complexes (i.e., with two ClpA rings bound to one ClpP molecule) were assembled in the presence of 2 mM ATPcS (Beuron et al., 1998) for both wild-type ClpA and ClpAD153. 2.2. Cryo-electron microscopy 3.5 ll drops of protein solution were applied to grids bearing thin continuous carbon films (for sideview averaging experiments) or to holey carbon grids (for 3D reconstruction). The specimens were vitrified in liquid ethane slush, transferred into a Gatan 626 cryo-holder, and examined in CM200FEG and CM120 electron microscopes (FEI, Netherlands), respectively, operated at 120 and 100 kV and magnifications of 38,000Â and 35,000Â. The level of underfocus was between 1.2 and  1.8 lm. The electron dose was $10 eÀ /A2 . Negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate (Ishikawa et al., 2001). 2.3. Digitization and image processing Micrographs were digitized with a SCAI scanner (Z/I Imaging, Huntsville AL) on a 7 lm raster. Particles were picked interactively using the program X3DPREPROCESS (Conway et al., 1993). Contrast transfer function effects were corrected by phase flipping, using the programs CTFZEROS and CTFMIX (Conway and Steven, 1999). General image processing was carried out with Bsoft (Heymann, 2001). 2.4. Three-dimensional reconstruction The procedures used will be described in detail elsewhere. In brief, sideviews of ClpAP complexes were aligned and the ClpA portions of these images were excised using a program called SHAPE2 written for this purpose. These data were used to reconstruct the threedimensional density map via the projection-matching approach with EMAN (Ludtke et al., 1999). As starting model we used the map of Beuron et al. (1998) or simply assumed 6-fold symmetry. Resolution was estimated in terms of the Fourier shell correlation coefficient. Atomic models were fitted into the reconstruction manually, using O (Jones et al., 1991).

2.5. Two-dimensional image averaging Rotational and translational alignment and averaging were carried out using PIC-III (Trus et al., 1996) with outlier screening by OMO (Unser et al., 1986). When calculating difference maps, the two images under comparison were normalized to have the same background and the same value for the density peak in ClpP. The variance maps (Ishikawa and Wakabayashi, 1999) were each calculated from 1400 aligned images. 2.6. Molecular modeling To identify the spatial distribution of N-domains that best reproduces the cryo-EM data, we performed modeling experiments using Bsoft, EMAN, and a program written for this purpose. Cryo-EM images were simulated, following the method of Ishikawa et al. (2000). First, a three-dimensional atomic model of the hexamer would be assembled with one, two, or three domains of ClpA in desired positions, using the coordinates of Guo  et al. (2002). Its resolution was then limited to 20 A (using the bsf procedure in Bsoft). Projections from various view-angles around the symmetry axis were calculated (proj3d in EMAN) and an appropriate contrast transfer function applied (bctf in Bsoft). These sideviews were combined to obtain a cylindrically averaged sideview for comparison with the cryo-EM projections. We generated a number of models in which the location of N-domain was varied by appropriate rotations and shifts. Goodness of fit was judged both visually and by calculating cross-correlation coefficients between corresponding areas of the simulations and the cryo-EM difference image.

ClpP, which represents the tier of D2 domains, often resolves into two or three discrete spots (Fig. 1B, arrows), depending on the viewing angle, whereas the outer layer is a more uniformly thick striation. This distinction suggests that D1 and D2 domains are coordinated differently in their respective tiers. 3.2. Three-dimensional structure of the ClpA hexamer ClpA with bound ATPcS was reconstructed to  $11.5 A resolution from 6080 sideviews taken from ClpAP complexes (Fig. 2). A priori knowledge that these images represent sideviews provided a valuable constraint when determining the moleculesÕ orientations for 3D reconstruction. The structure determination and its reconciliation with the atomic structure of the ClpA monomer will be described elsewhere. For present purposes, we describe its overall features, with particular attention to the portion of the molecule where the Dl and N-domains are expected to reside.   The overall dimensions are 80 A in height and 130 A in maximum diameter. Two sideviews, one rotated by 30° relative to the other, are shown in Figs. 2A and B. They show two tiers of six structural units. Between the  tiers are holes $40 A across that lead into a sizable internal cavity. The top tier, of Dl domains, is domeshaped and the structural units are closely apposed: the yellow arrow in Fig. 2A marks an interface between them. In the bottom tier, of D2 domains, there are gaps between adjacent structural units (red arrow in Fig. 2A). There is a relative rotation of about 15° between the two rings, as judged relative to the inter-unit interfaces. 3.3. The N-domains are invisible in the ClpA hexamer density map The six structural units in the top tier are of suitable size to represent D1 domains, but there are no features

3. Results 3.1. Cryo-electron microscopy of ClpAP complexes Sideviews of axially stacked complexes are particularly informative because the components--in this case, ClpA, ClpP, and the second ClpA--are largely separated, with minimal overlap. When ClpAP is prepared on a continuous carbon film, most complexes present sideviews (Fig. 1A) and we used this procedure for our two-dimensional averaging experiments. On the other hand, for three-dimensional reconstruction, it is desirable to dispense with the underlying carbon film in order to reduce noise. Although ClpAP has a tendency to orient perpendicular to the film of buffer when prepared over thick holey carbon films, by using thinner holey carbon films we were able to obtain an adequate numbers of sideviews. Even in raw (non-averaged) sideviews, ClpA presents an evidently two-layered structure. The layer adjacent to

In yellow is shown the atomic model within the same slice of the hexamer (Guo et al., 2002). The D1 portion fits snugly into the cryo-EM density but the N-domains extend into a region of no density. Surface rendering corresponds to a contour level that encloses 80% of the volume expected from the molecular weight of the ClpA hexamer without N-terminal domains. No sign of the N-domains was obtained, even by substantially lowering this contour level.

In ClpAD153.P (G), the regions occupied by Dl, D2 and ClpP show less variance than in ClpAP (H), probably because ClpAP complexes are more susceptible to slight misalignment on account of different positions assumed by the mobile N-domains.

that are candidates for the N-domains. This was surprising for a density map at this resolution because the N-domains are quite large, i.e., >50% of the mass of a

Dl domain (153 vs. 275 residues) and have a stable compact structure (Guo et al., 2002). To investigate further, we implanted the hexamer model of Guo et al.

(2002) in our density map. The Dl domains fit nicely into the top tier but the N-domains extend radially outwards into a region where there is no density to accommodate them (Fig. 2C). 3.4. Visualization of the N-domains by two-dimensional difference imaging, variance mapping, and ClpS labeling In another attempt to detect the N-domains, we compared averaged sideviews of ClpAP and ClpAD153.P, which contains a ClpA mutant lacking the N-terminal 153 amino acids. This experiment was performed both with negative staining and by cryo-EM (Figs. 3A­D). The negatively stained image of ClpAP (Fig. 3B) shows extra density at the distal surface of ClpA, which is not visible on ClpAD153.P (Fig. 3A). With the cryo-EM data, this extra density is barely visible (Fig. 3D), but it becomes apparent in the difference map obtained by subtracting ClpAD153.P from wild-type ClpAP (Fig. 3E). This extra density is the only significant feature of the difference image and it presumably represents the N-domains. These observations suggest that the N-domains are mobile. This idea is supported by a variance map calculated from aligned sideviews of ClpAP (Fig. 3H). Such

an image is expected to show higher values in regions occupied by mobile elements. There is an extended region of high variance (dark area in Fig. 3H, arrows) at the outer edge of ClpAP that coincides with the region occupied in the difference map (Fig. 3E). No such feature is seen in the control variance map of ClpAD153.P (Fig. 3G). ClpS, which binds the N-domain of ClpA with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Guo et al., 2002a; Zeth et al., 2002), should afford another density marker. Accordingly, we

performed a difference imaging experiment between sideviews of ClpAP/ClpS (Fig. 3I) and ClpAP (Fig. 3J). In this case, the main feature of positive density--attributable to ClpS--appears in the same place as the density assigned to the N-domains in the previous experiment. All three sets of observations consistently indicate that N-domains of ClpA are highly mobile and assume positions in which they extend axially, not radially, outwards from the Dl tier. 3.5. Modeling the three-dimensional distribution of Ndomains Although the N-domains are quite large, they are almost invisible in the averaged cryo-EM sideviews. To be smeared out to this extent, they must be highly mobile. Since the N-domain (residues 1­142) has a well defined fold, the source of this mobility must lie in the flexibility of the linker that attaches it to Dl. Residues 143­168 are not seen in the crystal structure, consistent with the imputed flexibility. In order to estimate the median position occupied by the N-domain and the scale of its fluctuations, we performed molecular modeling experiments (Fig. 4). Our goal was to generate distributions of Ndomains that produced averaged sideviews that match the difference density image obtained between ClpAP and ClpAD153.P (Fig. 4C). Figs. 4D­G show the simulated difference map of the N-domains obtained with the hexamer model of Guo et al. (2002). In it, the N-domains are symmetrically disposed around the periphery of the Dl ring. The main feature of the simulated difference map  (Fig. 3G) is two foci of density, each $25 A across, with a  center-to-center spacing of 130 A. The appearance of these densities is radically different from that obtained by cryo-EM (Fig. 4C), which shows a diffuse chevron of density displaced axially (vertically in these images) relative to the D1 tier. To obtain a better fit, the N-domains were moved closer to the axis and displaced in a distal direction. The position shown in Figs. 4H­K, which corresponds to a 70° rotation about a pivot point at the N-terminus of the Dl domain, gave a higher correlation with the cryo-EM data. However, in the ClpAP simulation (Fig. 4I), the N-terminal density is too strong and the difference density (Fig. 4K) is too focused to provide a satisfactory match. Accordingly, we introduced fluctuations into the positions of the N-domains. Figs. 4L­O correspond to   fluctuations of Æ15­18 A and Figs. 4P­R to Æ30­35 A. The fluctuations were not isotropic but were primarily arc-like movements towards and away from the symmetry axis, in order both to avoid clashing with D1 density and to avoid smearing the distribution axially in a way that diverged from the cryo-EM data. The latter simulation (Fig. 4R) is in good agreement with the cryoEM difference map (Fig. 4C).

4. Discussion 4.1. Distal densities visualized on ClpAP complexes In the first negatively stained sideviews of ClpAP, in addition to the twin striations of Dl and D2, adjacent density was seen and tentatively interpreted as another domain of ClpA (Kessel et al., 1995). In further study, it was observed that this density increased markedly with specimen storage time, suggesting that the additional density represents bound protein, i.e., ClpA subunits scavenged as substrate (Beuron et al., 1998). Our current view is that both interpretations are correct: this is the region occupied by the elusive N-domains but it is also the region where substrates such as RepA and, eventually, free ClpA subunits bind (ClpA subunits are also degraded by ClpAP itself--Maurizi (1991); Dougan et al. (2002)). The issue of whether substrates bind directly to the N-domain is considered further below. This distal density tends to be more visible in negative staining than in cryo-EM (cf. Figs. 3B and D), perhaps because uranyl acetate may fix the specimen (Zhao and Craig, 2003) or because the N-domains are immobilized as they dry down in the negative stain. 4.2. Mobility and median location of N-domains Our density map of ClpA shows no sign of the Ndomains (Fig. 2). However, three lines of evidence based on difference imaging and variance analysis indicate that the N-domains contribute a nebulous distribution of density that extends axially from the distal surface of the Dl tier. From molecular modeling, we estimated the median position of the N-domains and the extent of their fluctuations. In its median position, the N-domain is not in contact with the Dl surface but is connected to it only by the linker. The separation between them depends on the orientation of the N-domain and its azimuthal position around the symmetry axis--information that is more detailed than we can obtain--but is of the  order of 10 A. The fluctuations of N-domains about their median positions are large. A priori, they must be at least of the order of the dimensions of the domain    itself (35 A Â 30 A Â 45 A) in order to be smeared out to the extent observed. Our modeling suggests that they are  delocalized to within Æ30­35 A. Their median position is very different from that assigned in the hexamer model developed from the crystal structure of monomeric ClpA with bound ADP. This observation might be further evidence of the flexibility of the linker, which would allow the N-domain to form stable crystal contacts in a position far displaced from its average position in solution. Alternatively, the different positions of the N-domains in the respective contexts may reflect conformational changes associated with different nucleotide states as proposed for the

186

T. Ishikawa et al. / Journal of Structural Biology 146 (2004) 180­188

N-domains of p97 (Beuron et al., 2003; Rouiller et al., 2002). (Similarly, the conformational changes observed other ATP-driven motor proteins (e.g., Houdusse et al., 2000; Kikkawa et al., 2001; Jontes et al., 1995) are primarily associated with different nucleotide states). However, since nucleotides bind to Dl and D2, it is not clear how changes there would be transmitted to the Ndomain which is only loosely associated with Dl. The crystal structure shows a number of bonding  interactions within the 1300 A2 of surface area buried between the N-domain and D1, but they are not sufficient to form stable complexes of free N-domains with ClpAD153 (Guo et al., 2002). In principle, they might allow transient immobilization of N-domains in the context of intact ClpA but our cryo-EM data shows no significant occupancy of this site and our modeling indicates that most of the time the N-domain is not in direct contact with Dl (see above). 4.3. Role of N-domains in interaction with substrates In the case of p97, the N-domain is known to bind substrate directly (Nagahama et al., 2003; Nagiec et al., 1995). In Section 1, we summarized evidence that points to a similar role for the ClpA N-domain. Here we have localized the N-domains to a region previously shown to be occupied by bound substrate (Ishikawa et al., 2001). Our structural information is not sufficiently detailed to show that the N-domains bind RepA. The distribution of bound RepA density is spread out even more than that of the N-domains (cf. Fig. 3F). This distinction may be accounted for in two ways: either RepA binds directly to the N-domain(s) (Fig. 5B) and their mobility amplifies the smearing of density; or RepA binds to a near-axial site on the distal surface of the Dl-tier (Fig. 5C) where it excludes N-domains, biasing their distribution towards outer positions (cf. Fig. 5A). In the first scenario, the proposed second site must also exist. A first argument is that the substrate must somehow be introduced into the axial pathway and most of the time, the N-domains are far from it. Secondly, with highly mobile N-domains, substrate binding should not be limited to one per hexamer whereas binding of substrate to one of six equivalent near-axial sites would occlude the other sites, explaining the observed stoichiometry (Pak and Wickner, 1997). Thirdly, RepA binds to and is a substrate for ClpAD153. In this scenario, the fluctuating cluster of six N-domains would serve as a sort of antenna to capture substrate via an initial weak interaction, transferring them to the second, stronger binding, site for unfolding, and translocation. Thus Ndomains would not be absolutely required but would make the processing of substrates more efficient. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed ability of ClpAD153.P to degrade casein (Singh et al., 2001; Singh et al., in preparation).

In comparison, substrates also bind to the outer edge of ClpX (Ortega et al., 2000; Ortega et al., 2002), where its N-domains reside (Singh et al., 2001). In ClpY as well, the extra domain (I-domain) faces outwards from the distal surface of the AAA+ domain (Ishikawa et al., 2000; Sousa et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2001). 4.4. Entropic brush mechanism Alternatively, we can envisage an entirely different role for the N-domains. The inferred second site on the surface of the Dl tier must accept many different kinds of substrates and therefore cannot be highly specific. If this site is sticky and tends to bind other proteins unproductively, i.e., without being able to feed them into the pathway, their binding would impede the processing of bona fide substrates and thus impair the efficiency of the machine. In this case, collisions with fluctuating Ndomains might serve to dislodge such ``gate-crashers,'' freeing up the second site. In this scenario, the N-domains would also not be absolutely required but would make the functioning of ClpAP more efficient. They would act not by binding some proteins but by repelling others, serving as an ``entropic brush'' through their thermally driven motion, a mechanism that has previously been proposed in other contexts (Chen and Hansma, 2000; Hoh, 1998). 4.5. Mobile domains in other systems Like the N-domain of ClpA, the I-domain of ClpY has a putative role in substrate binding (Bochtler et al., 2000). Another point of similarity is that the I-domain is relatively mobile: in most of the crystal structures of ClpY reported to date, the I-domain is invisible on account of disorder, and in the first such structure, the Idomain was seen on only one of 6 subunits and 38 of its 112 residues remained invisible (Bochtler et al., 2000). Even so, we note that the mobility of N-domains is on a much larger scale: whereas the I-domains of ClpY are clearly visible in average sideviews (Ishikawa et al., 2000), the larger N-domains are almost invisible (cf. Figs. 3L and D). There have also been indications of N-domain mobility in EM studies of other AAA proteins, viz. VAT (Rockel et al., 2000; Rockel et al., 2002) and p97 (Rouiller et al., 2000; Rouiller et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2000). However, N-domain disposition in these systems differs from what we have encountered with ClpA in two respects. First is the scale of the fluctuations: other cryo EM reconstructions, at resolutions of 18­25 A, retained sufficient N-domain-associated density to allow docking of atomic models. This was not possible with ClpA on account of greater mobility that we estimate to involve  fluctuations of Æ30­35A. The second difference concerns the general location attributed to the N-domains

which are portrayed as peripheral to the Dl ring and in the same plane as it for VAT and p97. In contrast, the ClpA N-domains are displaced axially from the Dl ring and (most of the time) much closer to the symmetry axis. This positioning is appropriate for domains that serve to relay or guide substrates on to the axial pathway. It is less easy to see how N-domains peripheral to the Dl domains could communicate with the axial aperture on this ring. Finally, we note that the phenomenon of highly mobile surface domains loosely attached to an underlying core complex also occurs more widely, in other (non-AAA) systems. The multienzyme complex, pyruvate dehydrogenase represents a good example (Perham, 2000); here, the mobile external domains are thought to relay substrates from one active site to the next one along the reaction pathway.
