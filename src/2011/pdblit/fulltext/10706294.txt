wide ranges in time and temperature indicate that ligand binding is not a simple process, but consists of a series of sequential reactions as the ligand moves from the surrounding solvent through the protein to the binding site at the haem iron. A B D S MbCO , Mb*CO , Mb**CO , Mb  CO bound photolysed photorelaxed deoxy Initially the system has CO bound to the haem iron to form carbonmonoxy myoglobin (A, MbCO). After either thermal- or photodissociation, the CO migrates inside the haem pocket to a primary `docking site' (B, Mb*CO). At room temperature, midinfrared bands corresponding to state-B formation are generated within picoseconds after photolysis of MbCO11; as time evolves, the bands disappear either by geminate rebinding (B !A)10 or by relaxation to a new state. This second intermediate, which has been observed by for sperm whale myoglobin (swMb)11, is also geminate and builds up transiently at room temperature. The secondary docking site can also be populated at low temperature by illumination with intense laser light and is denoted photorelaxed state (D, Mb**CO)10. The two primary ligand-binding intermediates, states B and D, have median binding enthalpies of 10 and 30 kJ mol-1, respectively10. At high temperatures and after long times, the ligand escapes the protein matrix to the solvent state (S, Mb + CO, deoxy). Whether the second, spectroscopically distinct intermediate state is caused by a new docking site or by conformational changes induced in the protein has been the subject of much discussion7±14. A detailed analysis of recombination kinetics reveals that the ligand must be located elsewhere than the distal pocket in state D and suggests that proximal cavities are implicated in the rebinding pathway9. To address this issue, we determined the crystal structure of Mb**CO and compared it with that of Mb*CO and MbCO. We chose horse heart MbCO (hhMbCO) for our study because there is a single ligand-bound conformational substate at neutral pH (ref. 10) whereas sperm whale MbCO (swMbCO) has three taxonomic substates (A0, A1, A3)2,11,15 that potentially complicate the analysis. Because of differences in kinetics between the two species, we also determined the structures of hhMbCO and hhMb*CO (Table 1; Fig. 1). In hhMbCO, the ligand is bound almost perpendicular to the haem plane and the haem iron is in plane. In hhMb*CO, the photodissociated CO is located parallel to Ê the haem plane on top of the carbon pyrole at a distance of 3.6 A Ê from the haem iron. The iron has moved by ,0.25 A out of the mean haem plane, as described previously for swMb*CO (refs 16, 17). A CO orientation that has the carbon atom closer to the iron was preferred in the re®nement. Neither the distal nor the proximal histidine move signi®cantly upon photolysis, as described previously17,18. Spectroscopic measurements of the photolysed state11,12 reveal two bands that correspond to CO in different orientations in the distal pocket, one of which converts into the other with a low enthalpic barrier. Ê In hhMb**CO, the iron is ,0.23 A out of the mean haem plane (Fig. 2). There is no electron density at the positions of the bound or photolysed CO in the data set collected under illumination (some electron density for bound CO was observed in the data set collected without illumination during data acquisition; otherwise the two complexes are identical), but a new roundish peak appears below the haem plane (see Fig. 1b, c). It was modelled with a CO molecule having 30% occupancy, on the basis of results from equivalent spectroscopic studies carried out in solution. The round electron density assigned to the CO position is in agreement with the observation that the infrared band of state D is broader than that of the state B (refs 10,11,19) and the ligand is probably not oriented within the binding site. The ligand density is sandwiched between the side chains of the proximal His 93 and Phe 138, and surrounded

Small molecules such as NO, O2, CO or H2 are important biological ligands that bind to metalloproteins to function crucially in processes such as signal transduction, respiration and catalysis. A key issue for understanding the regulation of reaction mechanisms in these systems is whether ligands gain access to the binding sites through speci®c channels and docking sites, or by random diffusion through the protein matrix. A model system for studying this issue is myoglobin, a simple haem protein. Myoglobin has been studied extensively by spectroscopy, crystallography, computation and theory1±11. It serves as an aid to oxygen diffusion but also binds carbon monoxide, a byproduct of endogenous haem catabolism. Molecular dynamics simulations3±5, random mutagenesis6 and ¯ash photolysis studies7±10 indicate that ligand migration occurs through a limited number of pathways involving Ê docking sites. Here we report the 1.4 A resolution crystal structure of a ligand-binding intermediate in carbonmonoxy myoglobin that may have far-reaching implications for understanding the dynamics of ligand binding and catalysis. The ligand-binding reaction in myoglobin (Mb) has been studied by a variety of techniques1±14. Time-resolved and kinetic studies over

by Leu 89, Leu 104 and Ile 142. This site has been identi®ed as a binding site for xenon (Xe(1)) (ref. 14) and possibly O2 (ref. 2). Xenon is an anaesthetic and has been shown to bind preferentially in hydrophobic protein cavities14. Our data con®rm the assignment of the Xe(1)-binding site as a secondary ligand-docking site, which was suggested from room-temperature ¯ash photolysis studies on the O2-rebinding kinetics of wild-type and mutant forms of myoglobin8. Two relaxation rates have been observed (half-lives, 20 ns and 0.5±2 ms, respectively), suggesting two distinct transiently occupied binding sites8. The latter is signi®cantly affected in proteins having residues surrounding the Xe(1) site mutated (for example, Leu 104). Studies probing the formation of state D using mutagenesis implicate residues His 97 and Leu 89 (ref. 20). No density is observed in the distal xenon pocket, Xe(4), as suggested by mutagenesis and computational studies4,20,21. The trajectory for CO migration from the distal to the proximal side of the haem cannot be inferred from our structures. Anisotropic temperature factors from atomic resolution swMbCO

structures indicate that movement of the haem2,22 is primarily inplane, suggesting that a transient opening to the proximal cavity due to a sliding haem with concomitant motions of adjacent side chains may lie along the reaction path. This would be consistent with the proposal that relaxation is most probably triggered by the relaxation of the haem10,23,24. In general, computation studies show the ligand hopping between the four xenon-binding cavities before escaping to the solvent. Indeed, simulations of CO diffusion through Mb3,5,8 show the possibility of trajectories leading from the distal pocket to the Xe(1) site. Why should such a simple reaction as oxygen binding require such highly engineered and evolutionarily conserved docking sites? The answer may lie in the fact that dissolved O2 must compete with water to bind to Mb. Deoxy Mb has a water molecule inside the distal pocket near the state B site. As the concentration of water is 105 times that of O2 in oxygen-saturated solutions, state D may serve as a local `storehouse' of O2 near the active site, thereby increasing the effective O2 concentration many times. Thus, cavities or packing defects in Mb appear to have a functional role in ligand binding and may be important not only for the kinetics of ligand binding but also for determining relative af®nities. As the ¯uctuations connecting the cavities determine accessibility, picosecond ¯uctuations of side chains may have an evolutionarily conserved survival value25. The role of hydrophobic cavities as a means of controlling protein function may be a general feature in ligand binding in proteins as suggested earlier for Ni-Fe hydrogenase26. M
Horse heart Mb (Sigma) was crystallized at room temperature by equilibrating 10 ml drops of 5 mg ml-1 protein in 1.7±1.8 M ammonium sulphate and 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5 against 1 ml of 3.4±3.6 M ammonium sulphate and 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.4 using hanging-drop geometry. Rosette-shaped crystals grew within 2 weeks and lea¯ets (typically 0.01 ´ 0.07 ´ 0.3 mm) were separated for data collection. The hhMbCO crystals were prepared by soaking the lea¯ets in CO-saturated mother liquor supplemented with 8 mg ml-1 dithionate, 5 ml 2 M NaOH ml-1 and 7.5 % glycerol until a colour change occurred from brown to raspberry red. Subsequently, the crystals were ¯ash cooled in liquid nitrogen. For data collection of the photorelaxed hhMb**CO complex a hhMbCO crystal was illuminated from both sides of the ¯at surface of the lea¯et with an Ar+-ion laser for 6 h at 160 K (intensity 4.6 mW mm-2), and then the temperature was ramped to 88 K at 10 K h-1 under continuous illumination. The diffraction data were collected under continuous illumination at beamline X12C at the NSLS using the 2k ´ 2k Brandeis CCD detector. The laser was then switched off and another dataset was collected (data not shown). After collection of the two hhMb**CO data sets, the crystal was unfrozen for ,30 s by blocking the Oxford cryostream before a third dataset was collected of the same crystal using a rotating anode and a Siemens Hi-Star detector (hhMbCO rebound). The data of the photolysed hhMb*CO complex were collected with the 2k ´ 2k Brandeis CCD detector at ,22 K using an open ¯ow helium cryostat to make rebinding negligible during data collection. Before data collection, the crystal was illuminated for 30 min, and then diffraction data were collected under continuous illumination with white light obtained from a ®bre illuminator as described16. The diffraction data were reduced with XDS27 and scaled with XSCALE. The structures were re®ned with XPLOR3.851 (ref. 28) using PDB entry 1AZI as a starting model omitting water molecules, the ligand and sulphate ions. Re®nement included simulated annealing to 2,200 K and individual B-factor re®nement. Model building was done with the program O29. The CO molecules were inserted at the last step of the re®nement. Figures were prepared with Bobscript30.
