Recent findings from a sample of patients with acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain and headache indicate that fear of pain is characterized by latent continuity; that is, it is non-taxonic. It remains to be determined whether the latent structure of fear of pain is consistent between patients seeking treatment for pain versus those drawn from representative community samples. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if the latent structure of fear of pain is characterized by latent continuity in a representative community sample of older adults. Using taxometric methods in a sample of 459 community dwelling older adults, we sought to evaluate the latent structure of fear of pain as indexed by the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale. Results from analyses of simulated Monte Carlo data, MAXEIG-HITMAX, and L-mode consistency tests indicated that the latent structure of fear of pain in this sample was the same as that previously reported in clinical samples, being non-taxonic and characterized by latent continuity. These findings confirm initial findings that fear of pain, at least as measured by the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, is continuous, occurring along a latent continuum ranging from low to high. Results are discussed in relation to the conceptual understanding of fear of pain, implications for assessment and treatment, and future research directions.

1. Introduction Fear of pain (FOP) is conceptualized as a multidimensional individual difference characteristic comprising cognitive, behavioral, and physiological components that motivate adaptive withdrawal from potentially harmful and painful situations. However, like other fears that become excessive (Barlow, 2002), FOP can play a key role in catastrophic patterns of thinking, hyper-arousal, and maintaining maladaptive behavior and disability (Vlaeyen and Linton, 2000); that is, it is a mechanism through which pain and maladaptive pain-related behavior are maintained. In this context, FOP is often assessed as part of treatment outcome, in studies of pain management protocols (McCracken et al., 2006), and those specifically oriented to reducing excessive FOP (Woods and Asmundson, 2008). It has also been suggested that assessing FOP at the time of musculoskeletal injury may facilitate early identification of those

people vulnerable for progression from acute to chronic pain (Linton and Boersma, 2004; Abrams et al., 2007). Despite growing research and clinical interest, understanding and conceptualization of the FOP construct are far from complete; for example, it remains to be determined whether pain sensations are the primary object of FOP. There are differing amounts of emphasis on whether the fear is of painful sensations per se (Vlaeyen and Linton, 2000), activities associated with those sensations (Waddell et al., 1993), or of painful reinjury (Kori et al., 1990). An alternative view is that FOP is a manifestation of anxiety sensitivity ­ a predilection to fear things that cause one to feel anxious, such as pain (Asmundson and Taylor, 1996; Greenberg and Burns, 2003). This view, when placed in the context of evidence that anxiety sensitivity may be taxonic (i.e., having putatively normative and pathological forms that are qualitatively distinct) (Bernstein et al., 2006a; Bernstein et al., 2006b), suggests that FOP could also be taxonic, mirroring latent taxonic variability in anxiety sensitivity. Preliminary evidence from a sample of 650 patients seeking treatment for musculoskeletal or headache pain (Asmundson et al., 2007) indicates that FOP is continuous (i.e., occurring along a latent continuum ranging from low to high) rather than taxonic.

However, because the base rate of a hypothetical taxon may be disproportionately represented in clinical samples (i.e., many patients may experience excessive FOP), it remains possible that FOP may be taxonic among community dwelling people not seeking treatment for pain. Whether a construct is best conceptualized as continuous or taxonic can be determined using an applied mathematical technique called taxometrics. Taxometric procedures applied in the context of careful sampling and strategic selection of measures have contributed substantially to current understanding of various types of psychopathology (for reviews, see Haslam, 2007; Haslam and Kim, 2002). In the case of FOP, establishing its latent structure as continuous or taxonic is important theoretically and clinically, as continuous and taxonic variables denote different underlying mechanisms and imply differing approaches to treatment. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the latent structure of FOP using taxometric methods in a sample of community dwelling seniors. Several measures are purported to denote the FOP construct (Asmundson et al., 2004). We elected to base the present analysis on Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS) (McCracken et al., 1992, 1993) data collected from community dwelling seniors for several reasons. First, unlike other FOP measures, the PASS is not situationally oriented (i.e., does not ask questions about specific painful situations); instead, its taps the multidimensional nature of the construct in a manner consistent with current FOP theory. Second, use of the PASS permitted direct comparison to the findings from our previous taxometric study of FOP among a clinical sample (Asmundson et al., 2007). Third, prior research has demonstrated the validity of the PASS among older adults and provided evidence that FOP does not seem to vary significantly as a function of age (Martin et al., 2005).

1994; Larsen et al., 1997). These include cognitive anxiety/interference related to pain (e.g., I find it hard to concentrate when I hurt), fearful appraisals of pain (e.g., Pain sensations are terrifying), escape and avoidance behavior in response to activities that are associated with pain (e.g., I try to avoid activities that cause pain), and physiological symptoms arising from pain (e.g., Pain seems to cause my heart to pound or race). Respondents are asked indicate the extent to which they engage in the thoughts and activities represented by the items when they experience pain using a 6-point scale anchored from 0 (never) to 5 (always). As such, higher scores represent greater FOP. The PASS has demonstrated good to excellent reliability and validity (McCracken and Gross, 1995; Asmundson and Larsen, 2000). 2.2. Procedure Following an initial telephone call during which participants were provided with details of the study, a questionnaire package (that included the PASS) was mailed to each participating senior. Following the completion of the questionnaire, a research assistant met with the participant in order to complete additional assessment tools (that were part of a larger study and required an interview format; see Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2007), including the MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975). The completed PASS questionnaires were picked up by the research assistant at that time. 2.3. Analytic approach and interpretation: taxometric analyses 2.3.1. Indicator selection Four theoretically and quantitatively based item-domains of the 40-item PASS were identified and used to build item-parcel manifest indicators of FOP: (1) cognitive anxiety, (2) escape and avoidance, (3) fearful appraisals of pain, and (4) physiological anxiety. Each of the four indicators bore item compositions identical to a well-established factor structure of the PASS (i.e., cognitive anxiety items 2, 6, 10, 14, 22, 26, 30, 34, 37, 40; escape and avoidance items 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39; fearful appraisals of pain items 1, 5, 8, 13, 16, 18, 21, 25, 29, 33; physiological anxiety items 4, 9, 12, 17, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 38) (McCracken et al., 1992; Osman et al., 1994). Factor analytically derived indicators limit artifactual nuisance correlations, provide meaningful sample indicators from all facets of a construct, and optimize internal consistency and distinctiveness of the indicators (Schmidt et al., 2004). This indicator construction also permitted direct comparison to past taxometric study of FOP among a clinical sample (Asmundson et al., 2007). 2.3.2. Maximum eigenvalue analyses (MAXEIG) MAXEIG were conducted in line with recent recommended guidelines (Ruscio and Ruscio, 2004). MAXEIG derives the maximum eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of a set of output indicators at varying levels of an input indicator. In so doing, on a rotating basis, three indicators served as output indicators while each remaining single indicator formed an input variable. Furthermore, MAXEIG divides the input variables with overlapping intervals (i.e., windows with a conventional default value of 90% overlap). Overlapping windows enable investigators to detect very low base rate taxa. MAXEIG affords a powerful and unique internal consistency test. Consistency tests, which characterize the taxometric approach, are intended to rule out the detection of a pseudo-taxon by requiring convergence of data on a common conclusion and specific values that are unlikely to result in the absence of a taxon. Similarly, consistency tests are important to guard against conclusions regarding pseudo-continuity (Haslam and Kim, 2002). This inchworm test is achieved by repeatedly conducting the MAXEIG analysis while systematically increasing the number of overlapping windows, thereby systematically

2. Method Participants included 459 community dwelling older adults who completed a questionnaire package, including the PASS, as part of a larger study focusing on pain and falls among seniors (Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2007). Their names were selected at random from a list of all retirees residing in a mid-size metropolitan area and initial contact was made by mail (i.e., a letter introducing the study and advising participants that they would receive a phone call). Participants were then contacted by telephone and were invited to participate if they were over 69 years of age. This age cutoff was employed in the larger study because falls are more likely to become a significant clinical issue after 70 years of age. Approximately 30% of those contacted were both eligible and willing to participate. The average Mini Mental Status Examination (Folstein et al., 1975) score was 27.5 (SD = 2.4) of a possible 30. This score falls within the cognitively intact range of functioning. Data from an additional 111 participants was collected but omitted because of missing information on the PASS. The majority of the participants (63%) were female, with an average age of 76.3 years (SD = 5.5), and average pain severity, as assessed by summing the items of the pain severity subscale of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (Kerns et al., 1985), was 5.0 (SD = 4.8; range = 0­18). Participants were primarily Caucasian and all spoke English fluently. The study was approved by the University's Research Ethics Board and all participants provided informed consent. 2.1. Fear of pain assessment The PASS (McCracken et al., 1992, 1993) is a self-report instrument developed to measure FOP. It comprises 40 items distributed equally on four 10-item subscales that measure factorially distinct dimensions of the construct (McCracken et al., 1992; Osman et al.,

decreasing the size of the sub-samples used to calculate maximum eigenvalues in each overlapping window. Plots of taxonic data yield an increasingly better defined uni-modal peak, as the number of windows is increased and the size of each window is decreased. In the instance of continuous data, in contrast, the systematic increase of the number of overlapping windows will produce flat, cusped, or multi-peaked plots that do not systematically peak (Waller and Meehl, 1998). The specific criteria used herein to conduct the eigenvalue plot ``nose-count" were based on the guidelines provided by Waller and Meehl (Waller and Meehl, 1998). For example, only peaked MAXEIG plots were interpreted as evidence of latent taxonicity. Although in some instances right-end cusped MAXEIG plots also may represent latent taxonicity (Schmidt et al., 2004), such cusped plots may equally likely represent positively skewed latently continuous data. Fifty internal replications were used to divide cases into overlapping windows by repeatedly resorting cases along the input indicator at random. Internal replications are particularly useful when MAXEIG input variables are divided by fixed-intervals and placed arbitrarily between equal-scoring cases. Thus, use of these replications is intended to minimize sampling error and bolster the reliability of the results (Ruscio, 2008). At each replication, the maximum eigenvalue of the two output indicators within each window was calculated, and these calculations were averaged across all replications. In the present study, we conducted the inchworm test by generating 4 sets of MAXEIG plots (50, 75, 100, and 125 windows). These specific values were selected on an a priori basis to produce four sets of MAXEIG analyses that assign approximately n = 35 cases per window in the final inchworm test, so that a sufficiently wide range of windows is used to detect a low base rate taxon, were it present, while guarding against sampling error. In addition, the nose-count and the coherency of the standard deviation of the base rate estimates served as additional internal consistency tests. After taxonicity was tested, the General Covariance Mixture Theorem (Waller and Meehl, 1998) was used to estimate the taxon base rate for each MAXEIG plot. If the MAXEIG analyses indicated a taxonic latent structure, then individual participants were assigned to the taxon and complement classes using the base-rate classification method (Ruscio, 2008) and latent parameters were subsequently estimated. 2.3.3. Latent mode analysis (L-mode) (Waller and Meehl, 1998) L-mode was conducted as a second external consistency test to ensure maximal independent testing of the latent structure of the FOP construct. L-mode derives the underlying factor score distribution by means of conducting a factor analysis with all available indicators and plots the distribution of scores on the first unrotated factor. L-mode infers taxonic latent structure from a bimodal distribution of the observed factor scores and continuous latent structure from a unimodal distribution (i.e., one factor). Finally, if the Lmode analysis indicated a taxonic latent structure, then individual participants were assigned to the taxon and complement classes based on the values of the factor score distribution modes and latent parameters were subsequently estimated. 2.3.4. Parameter-matched Monte Carlo simulations Following recently recommended guidelines for taxometric analyses (Ruscio, 2008; Ruscio et al., 2006; Ruscio et al., 2007), parameter-matched Monte Carlo simulated continuous and taxonic data were derived. Simulated continuous data were matched to the number of indicators, sample size, and importantly, the observed indicator correlation matrix, and the distributions of all indicators including their skew, kurtosis, and number of levels. Simulated taxonic data were similarly matched to the parameters of the research data. Ten separate sets of simulated continuous

and taxonic data were derived to bolster the reliability and precision of the simulated data and the taxometric analyses conducted with these simulated data (Ruscio, 2008). Monte Carlo simulated data were derived for two primary purposes. First, for the purpose of a priori suitability testing (Ruscio et al., 2006; Ruscio et al., 2007), and as conducted in previous investigations (Bernstein et al., 2006b; Zvolensky et al., 2007), all proposed taxometric analyses were conducted on each of the 10 simulated continuous and each of the 10 simulated taxonic data, before taxometric analyses of the research data were interpreted. By examining the degree to which it is possible to distinguish the taxometric plots of the simulated continuous and taxonic data under the parameter-matched conditions of the research data, the simulations demonstrate the capacity of the research data to afford meaningful taxometric analyses. Thus, only if each taxometric procedure could distinguish between the simulated continuous and taxonic data, could the data be interpreted meaningfully. If the simulated data pass the suitability tests, then the simulated data permit a second primary function. Specifically, the simulations allow investigators to compare the shape of the research data plots to the plots of the simulated taxonic and continuous data. If simulated continuous and taxonic data are discernible, then a non-taxonic pattern of findings in the research data may be reliably interpreted as a marker of latent continuity or non-taxonicity, whereas a taxonic pattern of findings in the research data can be reliably interpreted as evidentiary of taxonicity that likely is neither artifactual nor pseudo-taxonic. Thus, in addition to contrasting the taxometric plots of the research data to pre-defined criteria (Waller and Meehl, 1998), these parameter-matched simulations are useful because they provide an additional comparative idiographic benchmark for interpreting the data with respect to their unique parameters and thereby preclude pseudo-taxonic or pseudo-continuous conclusions. 3. Results 3.1. Suitability testing Prior to the interpretation of taxometric analyses of the research data, the suitability of the data for MAXEIG and L-mode analyses was tested using the parameter-matched simulated continuous and taxonic data (see Figs. 1 and 2, simulated plots). The MAXEIG inchworm consistency test of the simulated continuous data failed to yield unimodally peaked plots as the number of overlapping windows was increased but, instead, yielded flat, cusped or multi-peaked plots, whereas the taxonic data yielded unimodally peaked plots (Waller and Meehl, 1998).The L-mode analysis of the simulated continuous data yielded a unimodal factor score distribution, whereas the taxonic data yielded a bimodal factor score distribution. Because MAXEIG and L-mode analyses of the parameter-matched simulated data passed suitability tests, both analyses of the research data are likely to produce systematically meaningful and reliable conclusions with respect to the latent structure of FOP.1 3.2. MAXEIG Evidentiary of latent non-taxonicity or continuity of FOP, flat, cusped, or multi-peaked plots did not uni-modally peak even as the number of overlapping windows was increased in the inch1 Mean above minus below a cut analysis (MAMBAC) (Meehl and Yonce, 1994) was also used as an external consistency test of the latent structure of FOP; however, plots of the simulated data were not as conspicuously distinguishable as the MAXEIG plots of the simulated data and were therefore excluded. Notwithstanding, MAMBAC results of the research data were consistent with those of from MAXEIG and L-mode.

worm test (see Fig. 1) (Waller and Meehl, 1998; Ruscio and Ruscio, 2004). Thus, the MAXEIG analysis and the inchworm consistency test of the research data support the non-taxonic conjecture as the plots were characteristic of latent continuity (Strube, 1989; Schmidt et al., 2004). In addition, the MAXEIG plots of the research data were dissimilar to the matched simulated taxonic data and, moreover, were flat, cusped, or multi-peaked and so were more similar to the parameter-matched simulated continuous data

(see Fig. 1). The comparison curve fit index (CCFI), an emerging method for quantifying the extent to which research data are similar to simulated taxonic or continuous data, was calculated and interpreted based on guidelines of Ruscio and Marcus (2007). The CCFI can range from 0 to 1 (lower values suggest better fit to dimensional structure, a value of .50 suggests equivalent fit, and higher values suggest better fit to taxonic structure). For 50 windows CCFI = .39, for 75 windows CCFI = .34, for 100 windows

Fig. 2. L-mode factor score distribution plot of the manifest item-parcel indicators of the fear of pain: Parameter-Matched Research, simulated taxonic, and simulated continuous (dimensional) data. As illustrated in the simulated plots, taxonic data appear as a bimodal distribution whereas continuous data appear as a unimodal distribution. The research data were characteristic of latent continuity.

CCFI = .43, and for 125 windows CCFI = .43. These CCFI values, broadly in the dimensional range, are consistent with interpretation of the MAXEIG and inchworm consistency tests, further indicating the current data as more similar to the dimensional than taxonic simulated data. Finally, parameter estimates are not meaningful because taxonicity was not observed; the proposed parameter estimates are, by definition, based on class assignment and valid only when taxonicity is observed. 3.3. L-mode L-mode analysis of the four indicators produced a single unimodal factor score distribution (i.e., not bimodal), consistent with a non-taxonic or continuous latent structure (see Fig. 2) (Waller and Meehl, 1998; Schmidt et al., 2004). Furthermore, the L-mode plot of the research data was dissimilar to the parameter-matched simulated taxonic data and more similar to the parametermatched simulated continuous data (see Fig. 2). Moreover, providing further evidence of dimensionality, the L-mode CCFI = .36. Because taxonicity was not observed, parameter estimates cannot be meaningfully derived from the L-mode analysis; L-mode relies on the observation of a bimodal distribution in order to conduct class assignment and derive parameter estimates, neither of which was justified under the observed unimodal factor score distribution. Thus, convergence of evidence from MAXEIG and L-mode analyses of the research and Monte Carlo simulated data supports the non-taxonic or continuous latent structure of FOP among this community sample of older adults. 4. Discussion Contemporary fear-avoidance models of chronic pain (Asmundson et al., 1999; Vlaeyen and Linton, 2000; Norton and Asmundson, 2003) suggest that FOP ­ a multidimensional individual difference characteristic comprising cognitive, behavioral, and physiological components ­ is a mechanism through which pain and maladaptive pain-related behavior is maintained over time. As such, the FOP construct has become an important consideration in basic psychological research of pain and pain behavior, as a treatment outcome measure, and as a potential means of early identification of those at risk of progressing from acute to chronic pain following musculoskeletal injury. Despite growing interest in the FOP construct, much remains to be learned about its conceptualization and measurement. Preliminary evidence from clinical samples (Asmundson et al., 2007) indicates that FOP is continuous in nature; that is, it occurs along a continuum ranging from low to high, rather than existing as qualitatively distinct normative and pathological forms. However, because the base rate of a hypothetical tax-

on may be disproportionately represented in clinical samples of pain patients, it remains possible that FOP may be taxonic among community dwelling people not seeking treatment for pain. In the present investigation we sought to evaluate the latent structure of FOP using taxometric methods in a large sample of community dwelling seniors. Given the high prevalence of pain among older persons (Jones and Macfarlane, 2005), and the relevance of FOP in the determination of rehabilitation outcomes, we considered it important to study the FOP construct within this population. Results of taxometric analyses indicate quite clearly that FOP, as reported by this sample using the PASS, is characterized by latent continuity. The MAXEIG-HITMAX test produced eigenvalue plots that did not uni-modally peak even as the number of overlapping windows was increased, and L-mode analysis of indicators produced a single unimodal factor score distribution. Moreover, comparison of the research data with Monte Carlo simulated taxonic and continuous data revealed dissimilarity and similarity, respectively, and the CCFIs suggested that the data are more consistent with a continuous than taxonic structure. It is particularly noteworthy that the data plots presented in Figs. 1and 2 are very similar to those generated from the data of clinical sample reported by Asmundson et al. (2007); indeed, close inspection of the data revealed that, while central tendency values were greater among the clinical sample, the distributions of PASS subscale scores were very similar between samples. The observed consistency in taxometric results and distribution of scores between the current community sample and the clinical sample of Asmundson et al. (2007) provide a strong indication that conceptualizing the FOP construct as continuous is sound, that its measurement using the PASS is sensible, and that there is a clinical basis to treat FOP among healthy and pain samples in accordance with this latent continuity conceptualization. Several groups (Asmundson and Taylor, 1996; Greenberg and Burns, 2003) have provided empirical evidence that FOP is a manifestation of, or related to, anxiety sensitivity, a putatively taxonic individual difference construct that denotes the fear of anxiety (Bernstein et al., 2005; Bernstein et al., 2006b). This conceptualization is important because it suggests that FOP may best be understood as arising from fear of being anxious about pain and its effects and, as such, that assessing and treating fear of anxiety, instead of FOP, may be most effective in alleviating disabling FOP. However, evidence that FOP is continuous in a non-clinical sample adds to similar findings from a clinical sample (Asmundson et al., 2007) and other indications (see, for example, Keogh and Asmundson, 2004) that FOP and anxiety sensitivity taxonicity are distinct in nature; that is, the FOP construct, at least as measured by the PASS, likely denotes more than taxonic forms of fear of anxiety

sensations stemming from pain. This does not imply that people do not fear pain partly because they are frightened by anxiety, or that FOP is not a lower-order form of anxiety sensitivity; instead, it suggests that further empirical evaluation of the nature of the association(s) between anxiety sensitivity and FOP is warranted and, until such time, that comprehensive assessment of FOP include measures that tap both fear of anxiety and FOP. For example, the present findings, as well as those documented by Asmundson et al. (2007), may be interpreted in line with theoretical conceptualizations of FOP as a normative and adaptive mechanism evolved to protect individuals from physical injury and illness. Based on this theoretical perspective, FOP may indeed be a manifestation of, or related to, anxiety sensitivity; specifically, to the normative, theoretically adaptive, and multi-dimensional form of anxiety sensitivity, as opposed to the taxonic, putatively ``pathological" form of anxiety sensitivity. These findings also hold implications for treatment which, as suggested elsewhere, is indicated for those scoring in the higher range on measures such as the PASS (Abrams et al., 2007), and for treatment outcome expectations. As we have previously suggested (Asmundson et al., 2007), partial change is more likely with a continuous variable because a continuum has multiple and intermediate levels, whereas change in a taxonic variable may be difficult to initiate but may be more qualitatively dramatic once initiated (also see Strube, 1989). Outcome data from graded exposure in vivo for treating chronic musculoskeletal and other pain syndromes (Vlaeyen et al., 2001; Boersma et al., 2004; Woods and Asmundson, 2008) suggests that changes in FOP are gradual. More general psychological interventions for pain (e.g., McCracken et al., 2006) and interventions designed to reduce anxiety sensitivity (Watt et al., 2006) are also effective in reducing FOP; unfortunately, outcome evaluations of these studies have typically measured FOP and, in the case of the Watt et al. (2006) study, anxiety sensitivity only at pre- and post-treatment, making inferences regarding the process of change difficult. Regardless, based on the mounting evidence that FOP is continuous, we recommend that assessment of FOP as part of a preventive or treatment outcome evaluation occur regularly (e.g., every session) in order to capture the graduated patterns of decline that might be expected over the course of an intervention. There are several limitations of the present investigation that warrant mention. These limitations also underscore areas for future research. First, the sample comprised community dwelling seniors. Given that pain is prevalent among older adults (Jones and Macfarlane, 2005), including those in our sample (as reflected by the mean MPI score), some caution should be exercised regarding the generalizability of our findings to younger samples. Replication of our findings using samples of younger persons is needed. Second, we did not consider gender in our analyses. As FOP may differ as a function of gender, future taxometric analyses of the FOP construct using sufficiently large samples to permit consideration of gender are warranted. Third, there is an ongoing debate within the literature regarding optimal application and interpretation of taxometric procedures (e.g., Beach et al., 2005; Ruscio and Marcus, 2007). This debate includes issues such as the utility and accuracy of structural inferences about research data from simulated comparison data, the number of cases per cut/window within MAXEIG and similar analyses, and the application of fit indices (e.g., CCFI; Ruscio and Marcus, 2007) for comparing and contrasting research plots to simulated plots. The primary approach utilized in the present investigation reflects one approach to the application and interpretation of taxometric data. Future investigations and replications may be advised to consider various other approaches as they emerge and gain empirical support. Finally, as in the Asmundson et al. (2007) investigation, only one measure of FOP ­ the PASS ­ was used.

A multi-method approach may aid in refining the assessment of the latent structure of FOP through application of bootstrapped taxometric procedures (Meehl, 1995). The success of this approach may, however, depend on selection of self-report and behavioral measures that specifically assess general cognitive, behavioral, and physiological components of FOP that are consistent with contemporary fear-avoidance models, as opposed to situationally-specific avoidance responses. For example, use of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia ­ 11 (Roelofs et al., 2007), which measures somatic focus and activity avoidance, may be useful in this regard; on the other hand, the FPQ-SF (Asmundson et al., 2007), which measures fear in response to situations involving severe pain (e.g., breaking your leg), minor pain (e.g., getting a paper cut), injection pain, and dental pain may not be. This speculation awaits empirical scrutiny. In summary, the finding of FOP continuity in community dwelling seniors suggests that FOP is an individual difference variable that exists in all people in the same form, and varies between individuals only by degree along a single continuous latent dimension. It does not appear to exist as qualitative distinct normative and pathological forms. Combined with similar findings from a clinical sample of patients with acute and chronic musculoskleletal pain and headache, the current findings provide a strong indication that conceptualizing the FOP construct as continuous, and measuring it with the PASS, is sound. Importantly, given that FOP exists along a continuum, treatment interventions that have proven effective in reducing FOP in clinical samples should also prove useful in nonclinical samples that score high on measures of FOP. The reverse should also hold true, thereby allowing clinical scientists to evaluate state-of-the-art FOP preventive and treatment interventions in nonclinical samples prior to trialing with clinical participants. Careful attention to the process of change of FOP in preventive and treatment interventions may contribute further to our understanding of the construct and how and when to most effectively intervene to reduce pain-related disability and suffering. Research involving FOP among older persons ­ a population that presents with a high pain prevalence (Jones and Macfarlane, 2005) ­ is limited and more investigation in this area is warranted.
