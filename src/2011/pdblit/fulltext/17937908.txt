[ 12] Bovine Pancreatic Ribonuclease A: Oxidative and Conformational Folding S t u d i e s
By HAROLD A. SCHERAGA, WILLIAM J. WEDEMEYER, and ERVIN WELKER
Introduction For many years, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A, EC 3.1.27.5) has been a model protein for studies of protein structure, energetics, disulfide-bond reactions, and conformational folding.t-7 RNase A is a relatively small (124 amino acids) but stable protein that exhibits several remarkable structural and biochemical features (Fig. 1). RNase A possesses four disulfide bonds in the native state (26-84, 40-95, 58-110, and 65-72), an unusually large number for a protein of its size, making its oxidative folding from the fully reduced state one of the most complex ever characterized. 6'7 RNase A also possesses four X-Pro peptide bonds. of which two are cis (Tyr92-Pro 93 and Ash 113-Pro114) and two are trans (Lys41-pro 42 and Val116-Pro 1~7) in the native state. 8 This is also unusual, since the cis isomer is present in only 6% of X-Pro peptide bonds in the native structures of proteins. 9"10 However, these unusual features may be exploited to gain insight into protein folding, as reviewed in this article. In the first section of this article, we discuss the methods used to prepare wildtype and mutant ribonucleases, as well as variants that correspond to intermediates of oxidative folding. In the second section, we summarize the structural features of native RNase A. In the third section, we discuss the equili-brium unfolding transitions of RNase A and their structural characterization. In the fourth section, we describe the reductive unfolding and oxidative folding of RNase A, and the coupling of disulfide-bond reactions and conformational folding. In the fifth section. we discuss the effects of nonnative proline isomers on the conformational folding

The 26-84 and 58-110 disulfide bonds are fully buried in the native protein, whereas the 40-95 and 65-72 disulfide bonds may be exposed by local unfolding. Both Pro-93 and Pro-114 are cis in the native structure and are located in exposed, flexible loop regions; however, the isomer of Pro-114 has little effect on conformational folding, whereas the nonnative isomer of Pro-93 retards folding roughly 500-fold. Pro-42 and Pro-117 are both trans in the native protein, although the isomeric state of Pro-42 does not appear to affect conformational folding significantly.

of RNase A. In the sixth section, we review the conformational folding of pure isomeric states of RNase A, in which the complication of proline isomerization is absent. In the final section, we present some specialized techniques for reductive unfolding and oxidative folding experiments.

Preparative Methods Numerous preparative methods have been developed for RNase A. The earliest method involves direct purification from bovine pancreasS; indeed, the preparation of a large amount of RNase A by the Armour Company led directly to the adoption of RNase A as a model protein.ll Several purification protocols have

been developed for RNase A12; however, ion-exchange chromatography seems to provide high resolution and yields.13 It is important to distinguish wild-type RNase A from sundry chemical variants that may exhibit markedly different enzymatic activities and folding behaviors, la, 15 The RNase A gene was transferred into different expression systems to allow the preparation of site-directed mutants; however, only low yields could be obtained at first, because of the intrinsic cytotoxicity of RNase A. This technical hurdle was overcome by expressing RNase A in inclusion bodies in E s c h e r i c h i a coli.

such as RNase A. For example, the unblocked, structured disulfide species that have accumulated during oxidative folding may be isolated from their unstructured counterparts using a reduction pulse. 26 In this method, a short pulse (e.g., 1-2 min) of a low concentration of reducing agent (5-10 mM DTT red) is applied to the mixture. The unstructured species are reduced rapidly under such conditions, whereas the structured species are largely unaffected, since the presence of stable tertiary structure generally protects the disulfide bonds from such a reduction pulse. Once isolated in unblocked form, the structured intermediates may be used to investigate the final steps of oxidative folding. 26 The isolated, unblocked structured intermediates are also useful for preparing the unstructured disulfide ensemble having the same number of disulfide bonds. The isolation of this unstructured ensemble is important because the formation of the structured species from their unstructured precursors of this ensemble is generally the critical and rate-determining step in oxidative folding. 7 The unstructured ensemble may be prepared by transferring the structured intermediate to solution conditions that favor unfolding and allow intramolecular disulfide reshuffling reactions to occur (e.g., pH 8 at high temperatures or denaturant concentrations). On equilibration, the original disulfide species should comprise only a negligible fraction of the total ensemble, since entropy favors the population of all intermediates within the disulfide ensemble. For some proteins, it may be practical to include a preunfolding step at low pH so that, on jumping to the final conditions, the reshuffling is completed before significant air oxictation has occurred. Native S t r u c t u r e o f R N a s e A RNase A is composed of three ot helices and seven fl strands arranged in two "lobes" (Fig. 2). The first lobe consists of the second ot helix (or2, residues 24-34), the central/3 strand (/31, residues 41-45) and the major/3 hairpin (/34-/35, residues 79-104), whereas the second lobe includes the third ot helix (t~3, residues 50-60), the 65-72 hairpin (/32-/33, residues 65-72), and the C-terminal hairpin (/36-/37, residues 105-124). The two lobes meet in a positively charged groove that binds the RNA substrate (Fig. 3). The N-terminal helix (a 1, residues 3-13) rests between the two lobes and contributes the catalytically essential His-12 residue (Fig. 2). This helix is covalently connected to the rest of the protein by a poorly ordered segment (residues 16-23) that may be cleaved with no loss of activity to form RNase S I. Under folding conditions, the helix is bound to the rest of the protein with high affinity ( K d ~ 30pM) by noncovalent interactions. 5 The major hydrophobic core of RNase A is associated with the 58-110 disulfide bond in the second lobe of RNase A (Fig. 1). This cluster of hydrophobic

Each lobe of RNase A is created from the disulfide bonding of an or-helical element of the first half with /%sheet elements of the second half (Fig. 2). Specifically, the 26-84 disulfide bond pins the second ~ helix to the major 13 hairpin (forming the minor hydrophobic core), whereas the 58-110 disulfide bond joins the third ~ helix to the C-terminal 13hairpin (forming the major hydrophobic core). Interestingly, the C-terminal half appears to possess some flickering/%sheet structure even when the N-terminal half is fully unstructured, judging from fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) studies

An even more demanding task is the characterization of nonequilibrium distributions of conformations, such as the distributions of conformations at various times during conformational folding. This section is concerned with equilibrium states and transitions between them, whereas the remaining sections are devoted to nonequilibrium folding studies.

be divided into three stages: a pretransition stage, a cooperative-unfolding stage, and a residual-structure stage. A brief discussion of these three stages is given here. More detailed structural discussions of thermal denaturation have been presented by Burgess and Scheraga 31 (modified by Matheson and Scheraga 42) and in a fluorescence study that employed an unusually large set of tryptophan fluorophores. 43 In the pretransition stage, the folded state remains thermodynamically more stable than the unfolded state, but the structural fluctuations in the folded state become more pronounced as the transition temperature is approached from below. These enhanced structural fluctuations are evident from several types of experiments: proteolysis, 31'44-4s antigenicity, 49 electron paramagnetic spin resonance studies, 5° photolabeling, 42 enzymatic activity, 51 X-ray crystallography, 34 Raman, 34 and N M R data. 52'53 These structural studies also indicate that the redistribution of conformations does not occur uniformly throughout the protein, but that specific regions become labile as the temperature is increased. In particular, the data suggest that the second helix becomes destabilized at moderate temperatures well below the cooperative transition. This destabilization of the second helix in turn loosens the packing of the first helix in the major hydrophobic core (presumably because of the fight interaction between the first and second helices through the Tyr25-Asp 14 hydrogen bond54), leading to observable changes in Met13,~2'53 His_48,s3 and the binding of the S-peptide. However, the first helix remains attached to the protein until the cooperative thermal transition. The cooperative unfolding transition appears to occur near 60°C at neutral pH, corresponding to the point at which the unfolded state becomes thermodynamically stable relative to the folded state. This cooperative transition is evident in the appearance of new resonances in N M R (not continuous shifts of old resonances) 53 and in the superimposibility of the transition whether measured

Some residual structure remains even above the cooperative thermal transition, as observed by several methods, e.g., optical rotation, 41 viscosity, 56 histidine pK,, 52 IH NMR spectroscopy, 53 Raman spectroscopy, 34,62 near- and far-UV C D , 63 small-angle X-ray scattering, 59 Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, 64 and nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion. 65 The thermally denatured state has long been known to have a significantly smaller radius of gyration compared to the reduced and reduced-denatured states. 41 The residual structure of the thermally denatured state appears to be localized in the C-terminal, predominantly /3-sheet half of RNase A, particularly in the 65-72 and major/3 hairpins. 31'43 This residual structure also appears to be stable even when the temperature is increased further. 3~4~ However, this residual structure can be decreased by the addition of chemical denaturants such as 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHC1) 41'57'66 or completely eliminated by reduction of the disulfide bonds and 6 M GdnHCI. 41

pH Dependence of Thermal Unfolding Transition
Interestingly, the thermal transition temperature of RNase A changes dramatically (ATm ~ 30 °) as the pH is dropped from pH 5 to pH 2, apparently corresponding to the titration of one or more carboxylate groups. 55 Over the same pH range~ the unfolding rate of native RNase A increases almost 200-fold. 67 The reason for this has not been established definitively, but it may result from the breaking of a strong hydrogen bond between Asp-14 of the N-terminal ct helix and Tyr-25 of the second c~ helix. 29'54'68 Consistent with this hypothesis, the thermal stability of

wild-type RNase A can be enhanced by a similar amount (ATm ~ 20 °) at pH 5 by adding a covalent cross-link between Lys-7 and Lys-41 that stabilizes RNase A primarily by slowing its unfolding rate. 37'69'7° However, it has also been proposed that the pH sensitivity o f the thermal transition is associated with the loss o f a hydrogen bond between the C-terminal backbone carboxylate group of Val-124 and the backbone o f His-105. 31 This may correlate with the roughly 20-fold decrease in the refolding rate in RNase A molecules with a normative Pro-114 isomer (Uf) as the pH is lowered from 5.0 to 3.0, 29'71'72 Finally, the pH sensitivity may result from simple electrostatic interactions within the protein, 55'73 consistent with the well-known anomalous pKa values of certain side-chain carboxylate groups such as Asp-83 (pK~, ~ 1.8). 73-77 Thermal-Folding Hypothesis Although the unfolding transitions of RNase A are generally observed to be two-state transitions, the distribution of conformations within the folded and unfolded states varies with the solution conditions. 45 In particular, the fluctuations within the folded state increase as the unfolding transition is approached. Such fluctuations can be monitored by proteolysis, 31 disulfide-bond reduction and other chemical modifications, 26'78'79 or H / D exchange experiments, 8° which may provide estimates of the relative stabilities of specific segments o f the protein against local unfolding. Proteolytic studies of the gradual destabilization of RNase A during equilibrium thermal denaturation led to the thermal-folding hypothesis. This hypothesis conjectures that the order in which local structures become destabilized during equilibrium thermal denaturation resembles (in reverse) the order in which specific structures become stabilized on the nonequilibrium folding pathway. 31 In other words, the conformational distributions populated during equilibrium thermal denaturation may be analogous to the nonequilibrium distributions populated during conformational folding. Similar hypotheses were subsequently advanced on the basis of H / D exchange experiments. 8°'81 If true, the thermal-folding hypothesis 69 S. H. Lin, Y. Konishi, M. E. Denton, and H. A.

would allow relatively simple equilibrium structural studies to replace their technically demanding, nonequilibrium counterparts. However, the general validity of this hypothesis has not been established.

Denaturant-Induced Unfolding of RNase A
The addition of chemical denaturants such as 6 M guanidine hydrochloride to disulfide-intact RNase A produces an unfolded state that exhibits less conformational order than the thermally denatured state. 82 However, the radius of gyration is significantly lower than that expected for a statistical coil, presumably because of the four disulfide bonds cross-linking the protein. It appears that few short-range or long-range interactions persist in the chemically denatured state, but the nature of its conformational distribution remains to be determined more precisely.

Unfolding of RNase A by Reducing Its Disulfide Bonds
The reduction of the four disulfide bonds of RNase A under physiological conditions produces an unfolded state that exhibits significant conformational order. ~ As has long been known, the reduced state of RNase A has a significantly reduced radius of gyration compared to an ideal statistical coil. 41,s3,s4 The relative equilibrium populations of the 28 possible one-disulfide pairings are also not well described by a simple loop-entropy formula, indicating significant conformational biases, s5"86 Moreover, FRET experiments indicate that a significant fraction of the native tertiary topology is still present, particularly in the C-terminal, predominantly r-sheet half of the protein. 3° Recent experiments suggest that the local conformational order present in the reduced state is similar to that produced in the so-called "burst phase" of conformational folding, in which a chemically denatured but disulfide-intact protein is rapidly introduced to physiological folding conditions. ~'s7"88 This is another example of an equilibrium state whose conformational distribution may resemble (at least locally) that of a nonequilibrium state populated during conformational folding. By contrast, if fully reduced RNase A is also treated with a strong denaturanl such as 6 M GdnHC1, the reduced-denaturedstate is produced. This state is unique among the unfolded ensembles described in this section, because it appears to have little or no residual short-range or long-range structure and, hence, closely resembles a simple polymer with excluded-volume interactions (the so-called statistical

Disulfide-intact RNase A has been unfolded by numerous other methods such as acid denaturation, 29'66 cold denaturation, 89,9° and pressure denaturation. 89'91 These methods do produce unfolded protein in a two-state transition; however, the resulting unfolded state in these cases appears to be significantly ordered.

Other Equilibrium States of RNase A
Some experiments have suggested that multiple unfolded equilibrium states may exist under unusual solution conditions. 57,9~ The conformational properties of these anomalous unfolded states have not been well characterized. In some cases, e.g., at high concentrations of lithium perchlorate, 93'94 the amount of/3 structure appears to be decreased, perhaps by reducing the electrostatic stiffening observed in nucleic acids and other electrostatically-interacting polymers. 95 The reverse transition to/~-favoring structures under low-pH, low-salt unfolding conditions has been observed in the ot/fl protein phosphoglycerate kinase. 96 By contrast, or-helical structures are favored in the unfolded state when trifluoroethanol and similar fluorine-substituted alcohols are added, 96'97 possibly by reducing the wellknown solvent competition for hydrogen bonds to the amide groups of the protein backbone. 98 R e d u c t i v e U n f o l d i n g a n d O x i d a t i v e F o l d i n g of R N a s e A The term oxidative folding describes the composite process by which a reduced, unfolded protein recovers both its native disulfide bonds (disulfide-bond regeneration) and its native structure (conformational folding).

the native disulfide bonds is a critical step in the maturation of many extracellular proteins. Oxidative folding is also an important stumbling block in the preparation of proteins for pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications, particularly multidomain proteins with several disulfide bonds. 99 Controlled in vitro experiments on relatively simple proteins such as RNase A may help to determine the factors affecting the regeneration of the native disulfide bonds both in vivo and ~br complex proteins. Stable tertiary structure is one such factor. 6 Oxidation, reduction, and reshuffling are based upon a single chemical reaction, thiol/disulfide exchange, ~°°"10~ in which a thiolate anion approaches a disulfide bond closely enough to delocalize its negative charge between the three sulfur atoms. Stable tertiary structure can inhibit such contacts between thiolates and disulfide bonds by controlling the accessibility, reactivity, and proximity of these reactive groups. For example. the burial of the disulfide bonds in stable tertiary structure inhibits their reduction and reshuffling, whereas the sequestering of thiol groups can inhibit their oxidation, i.e., the formation of disulfide bonds. Other structural factors include local electrostatic interactions (which may affect the local concentration, pK,~. and reactivity of the negatively charged thiolate groups) and structural propensities (which may alter the effective concentrations of the reactive groups for each other). Definitions of Technical Terms We adopt the following terminology to describe the covalent structure of the disulfide intermediates, A disulfide species refers to a protein with a particular pairing of cysteines in disulfide bonds, while a disulfide ensemble is any collection of disulfide species. A des species is a disulfide species with all but one of the native disulfide bonds; for example, the des[65-72] species of RNase A has three native disulfide bonds but lacks the 65-72 disulfide bond. The term des signifies only a covalent property (the absence of one native disulfide bond) and does not specify whether the species is folded. A subscript is added to characterize the conformational state; thus, desu and desN represent the unfolded and folded states of a des species, nS represents an ensemble of (typically unstructured) disulfide species with n disulfide bonds that are in a rapid reshuffling equilibrium among themselves; for example, 2S represents an ensemble of rapidly interconverting disulfide species with two intraprotein disulfide bonds. The rapid interconversion within such ensembles allows them to be treated as single kinetic species, although they are a heterogeneous mixture of disulfide ~9 D. R. Thatcher and A.

species. 1°2 The ensemble of disulfide species with no protein disulfide bonds is denoted as R, the fully reduced ensemble (the multiplicity of R is due to the possibility of mixed disulfide bonds). Fully oxidized, nonnative species are denoted as scrambled disulfide species, e.g., those of the 4S ensemble in RNase A. A more general nomenclature of disulfide species (including mixed disulfide species) has been published. 1°3 We introduce here the following terminology to describe the protection of disulfide bonds and thiol groups in structured disulfide species. In disulfide-protected species, the disulfide bonds are protected from reduction and reshuffling. Such species often accumulate since the inhibition of reshuffling in these species reduces their rate of disappearance significantly. A subset of disulfide-protected species are the metastable disulfide species, in which both the disulfide bonds and thiol groups are protected, inhibiting all disulfide-bond reactions (oxidation, reduction, and reshuffling). Thus, a local or global unfolding step must precede disulfide-bond reactions in such metastable species. It suffices to bury all but one thiol group in such species, since the remaining thiol group would have no partner with which to react. Two other terms (disulfide-secure~insecure) are introduced below to describe the relative protection of the disulfide bonds and thiol groups.

Reductive Unfolding of RNase A
In reductive unfolding experiments, a native protein is placed under strongly reducing conditions and the loss of its disulfide bonds and conformational structure is monitored. Since disulfide bonds are generally buried in native proteins, TM the reduction of such a disulfide bond must be preceded by a local or global unfolding step that exposes the bond to the redox reagent. The AG ° for these unfolding steps can be estimated from the rate at which the corresponding disulfide bonds are reduced79 and measures the stability of the protective tertiary structure. The reduction of only one native disulfide bond often produces a des species with native-like structure. However, when enough disulfide bonds (usually two) become reduced or reshuffled, most disulfide-bonded proteins unfold globally because the native fold is no longer thermodynamically stable relative to the unfolded state. After global unfolding, the protein is rapidly reduced to its fully reduced state R, because all disulfide bonds are accessible to the redox reagent. This general scenario is consistent with the reductive unfolding of RNase A. Under typical conditions (pH 8, 15-25 °, with DTT r~d as the reducing agent), the

FIG.4. The reductive unfolding of RNasc A. reductive unfolding of RNase A appears to proceed entirely through two parallel pathways, corresponding to two independent, local unfolding events exposing the 65-72 and 40-95 disulfide bonds, respectively (Fig. 4). 79 Reduction of these disulfide bonds results in two des species, des[65-72] and des[40-95], both with native-like structure. 38' t05-m7 The two remaining des species, des[26-84] and des[58-110], have not been observed in the reductive unfolding of native RNase A, presumably because the activation free energies for the unfolding steps exposing these disulfide bonds is much higher than those for the unfolding steps exposing the 40-95 and 65-72 disulfide bonds. This explanation is structurally plausible, because the disulfide bonds 26-84 and 58-110 are buried in the core of the native conformation s and thus may require global unfolding to expose them; by contrast, the 40-95 and 65-72 disulfide bonds are only partially buried and may be exposed with local unfolding. Des[2684] and des[58-110] also have a low conformational stability 16'ms-lm and, hence, are reduced much more rapidly than des[40-95] and des[65-72]. In principle, this could also account for their apparent absence in reductive unfolding; kinetic data TM indicate that little of the protein is reduced through such pathways, however. The disulfide bonds of native-like species, des[40-95 ] and des[65-72], are also buried in protective tertiary structure and are likewise reduced through unfolding events (Fig. 4). 79 The more stable des[65-72] seems to be reduced through the same unfolding event that precedes the reduction of the 40-95 disulfide bond in the natix e t~)5S.

protein, 79 i.e., the 40-95 disulfide bond is preferentially reduced in the des[65-72] species while the 26-84 and 58-110 disulfide bonds are largely untouched. As in the native protein, this preference probably results from a relatively low free energy to expose the 40-95 disulfide bond compared to the two other disulfide bonds. By contrast, the des[40-95] species seems to be reduced through a global unfolding step 111 that exposes all three of its disulfide bonds roughly equally.112 The reductive unfolding of isolated des[26-84] and des[58-110] has not been studied, but these species are even less stable than des[40-95] and are likely reduced through global unfolding as well (unpublished results). Following either the reduction or reshuffling of a disulfide bond in any of these des species, the protein is unfolded conformationally and is reduced rapidly to the fully reduced state R, because its disulfide bonds are accessible to the redox reagent (Fig. 4). 79 The nature of these local unfolding steps is currently being investigated. It has been suggested that cis/trans isomerization o f t h e Tyr92-Pro 93 peptide bond may be involved in the local unfolding that precedes the reduction of 40-95.111 Similarly, the 65-72 disulfide bond may be exposed by a simple unfolding of the C terminus, since Ala-122 and Val-124 contribute to the small hydrophobic core protecting this disulfide bond. It has long been known that the unstructuring of these C-tenrtinal residues does not lead to global unfolding.1 Experiments that test these hypotheses for the two local unfolding steps of reductive unfolding are underway. Under strongly reducing conditions, the reshuffling pathways of the des species are relatively minor, presumably because the same unfolding step exposes the disulfide bond both to the redox reagent and to the protein thiolate groups and, under such conditions, the redox reagent competes effectively with the protein thiolate groups to reduce (not reshuffle) the protein disulfide bond.

Oxidative Folding of RNase A
The oxidative folding of RNase A is significantly more complex than its reductive unfolding, since it involves a large number of intermediates, consistent with the large entropic barrier needed to be overcome to find the native disulfide pairing. Under typical conditions (pH 8, 25°C, with DTT °x as the redox reagent), the oxidative folding of RNase A is fit by the kinetic model of Fig. 5a. 26'113-115 In the early stages of oxidative folding, the disulfide ensembles 1S-4S are populated by successive oxidations, until a preequilibrium (quasi-steady-state condition) is established among these ensembles. No stable structure has been detected in these ensembles, although they do exhibit some conformational order. 6 The distribution

The rate-determining step in the regeneration of native RNase A is the formation of two des species, des[40-95] and des[65-72], with native-like structure.38,105-107 These species are formed largely by reshuffling from the 3S ensemble, 26'113 although a small fraction (no more than 5%) may be formed by oxidation from the 2S ensemble, 114,1t5 detected only by studies of oxidation of mutant analogs of the des species (Fig. 5b). On formation and folding of either des[40-95] or des[65-72], their three native disulfide bonds become protected from reduction and reshuffling ("locked in"), causing these des species to accumulate to much higher levels. However, their thiol groups remain accessible to the solvent and, hence, these species oxidize relatively rapidly to the native protein. These pathways appear to account for nearly all of the native RNase A regenerated under typical oxidative folding conditions. 26 Stable conformational structure appears to be essential for this acceleration of oxidative folding. The regeneration becomes drastically slower when carried out under conditions that destabilize the conformational structure of the folded des species. 78'1°6,107 Moreover, the original rate of regeneration can be restored by adding other agents that restabilize the conformational structure (e.g., phosphate salts). 1°9 Thus, the protective structure of these des species is the critical 116D.

factor in promoting oxidative folding. This type of pathway in which disulfide intermediates adopt native-like structure and protect their native disulfide bonds from rearrangement has been denoted as a "desN-type" pathway and appears to be essential for the efficient regeneration of proteins with several disulfide bonds. 7 The oxidative folding of mutant analogs of des[40-95] and des[65-72] (the three-disulfide mutants [C40A,C95A] and [C65S,C72S]) has also been characterized. 114,115Consistent with the absence of structured two-disulfide intermediates in wild-type RNase A, neither mutant exhibits any folded disulfide intermediates prior to forming all three native disulfide bonds. In both mutants, the ratedetermining step is the formation of the native protein by oxidation from the unstructured 2S ensemble and conformational folding (Fig. 5b). This type of pathway in which no structured disulfide intermediates are populated in oxidative folding has been denoted as a "desu-type" pathway and is observed primarily in proteins with relatively few (<3) disulfide bonds. 7 The other two des species, des[58-110] and des[26-84], have stable conformational structure only under strongly stabilizing conditions, e.g., in the presence of stabilizing salts 1°9 or at low temperatures (< 15°). 1°8 Under such conditions, these des species are metastable dead-end species that reshuffle preferentially to the 3S ensemble rather than oxidizing to the native protein. (Accordingly, such species are said to lie on "metastable, dead-end pathways. ''7) The thiol groups and disulfide bonds of des [58-110] and des[26-84] appear to be buried; thus, oxidation as well as reduction and reshuffling are inhibited. 116a This burial of thiol groups is structurally plausible, since these des species probably have native-like structures [judging from enzymatic activity measurements 11° and their high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) elution properties], and the 26-84 and 58-110 disulfide bonds are fully buried in hydrophobic cores of the native protein. Even mixed disulfide bonds can become buried in stable conformational structure. This is observed in the oxidative folding of RNase A through the covalent adduct N', in which a DTT molecule crosslinks cysteines-65 and -72.15 Kinetic data indicate that N ~is formed through the burial of a mixed disulfide bond between a DTT molecule and one cysteine, probably Cys-72.1°5 The remaining thiolate of the covalently bound DTT molecule forms a disulfide bond with a second DTT molecule, which is attacked by the remaining protein thiolate to form the adduct. Such protected mixed disulfide bonds seem more likely to form with linear redox reagents such as glutathione 117 than with rapidly recyclizing reagents such as DTT.

species are generated from unstructured precursors. Such folding-coupled regeneration steps divide the oxidative folding into three stages: (1) a prefolding stage in which the disulfide species are largely unstructured and the disulfide-bond reactions occur at rates determined largely by loop--entropy and conformational biases; (2) a posffolding stage in which the disulfide species are largely structured and the disulfide-bond reactions occur at rates determined largely by the accessibility and proximity of the reactive groups; and (3) the folding-coupled regeneration steps themselves, in which conformational folding and unfolding events compete with disulfide bond reactions.

Insights into Con[ormational Foldingfrom Oxidative Folding Experiments
Experiments carried out in each stage of oxidative folding yield complementary insights into the process of conformational folding. First, in the prefolding stage, the relative populations of disulfide species can be used to assess the conformational biases present in the unstructured ensembles relative to an idealized ensemble in which only loop entropy would determine the disulfide-bond reaction rates. 85"s6 These measured biases help to characterize the conformational order present in the earliest stages of conformational folding of the protein. 6 In fact, FRET experiments 3° demonstrate that the reduced protein, under folding conditions, has a considerable fraction of the native backbone topology, but a large separation between the N- and C-terminal halves. Thus, the molecule is already poised for the conformational folding that occurs when three of the four disulfide bonds are formed. Second, in the postfolding stage, the relative accessibility and proximity of different cysteines in the native protein can be assessed from their relative reaction rates, similar to the situation described above for reductive unfolding. Third, the competition between conformational folding and disulfide-bond reactions in folding-coupled regeneration steps can be exploited to characterize the structures populated in conformational folding. In principle, chemical analysis of the disulfide species produced in such steps can report on the transient distributions of conformations present in folding through the relative reactivities of different disulfide bonds and thiol groups. We now describe these three types ol experiments in more detail. In folding~coupled regeneration steps, conformational folding can be investigated by setting up a competition between conformational folding and distilfide reshuffling or between conformational folding and disulfide reduction. In the former reshzofling-competition protocol, the initially unfolded protein (with at least one free thiol group) is jumped to conditions that favor both conformational folding and disulfide-bond reshuffling (e.g., from low to high pH), followed by a quench of the reshuffling reactions. In the analogous reduction-competitio~ protocol, the initially unfolded protein (with no free thiol groups, i.e., disulfideintact protein) is jumped to highly reducing conditions (e.g., 100 mM DTT r~a) that otherwise strongly favor conformational folding, followed by a rapid quenching

208

[ 12]

of the reduction reactions. These methods may reveal differences in the rates at which different parts of the protein become protected from reduction during slow conformational folding. Moreover, the relative rates of reduction/reshuffling may also help to characterize the distributions of conformations populated during such folding. In the prefolding stage of oxidative folding, the distributions of disulfide bonds in the 1S and 2S disulfide ensembles indicate the presence of significant conformational order. The relative concentrations of disulfide bonds in these ensembles show significant deviations from random probabilities, 85'86 indicating significant enthalpic contributions to the free energy in addition to the loop entropy. In particular, the 65-72 disulfide bond is strongly favored, comprising fully 40% of the 1S ensemble, 85 and exists in an even larger fraction of the 2S ensemble. 86 However, these enthalpic contributions appear to be dominated by local interactions, i.e., interactions between residues near the cysteines of the disulfide bonds, since nearly identical enthalpic contributions are observed in homologous oligopeptide model systems. 118-120 Moreover, the enthalpic contributions observed in the 1S ensemble appear to account for those observed in the 2S ensemble (unpublished results). An NMR study of two-disulfide mutant analogs of RNase A TM also indicated that a disulfide species with two native disulfide bonds may exhibit no more structure than those with two nonnative disulfide bonds. These results suggest that the conformational order does not increase strongly with the number of disulfide bonds, prior to the appearance of native-like structure in the folding-coupled regeneration steps. The rapid reshuffling of disulfide species in the prefolding ensembles casts doubt on recent "rugged funnel" models of protein folding. These models propose that stable, misfolded states populate the energy landscape of proteins densely, and that a protein will collapse globally into a slowly rearranging, "glassy" state whenever it is prevented from entering the "native folding funnel." Given that the prefolding ensembles generally sample most of the possible disulfide species, 6 such rugged-funnel models are inconsistent with the absence of long-lived disulfide species with nonnative disulfide bonds and normative stable tertiary structure. To study the pos~eolding stage, we isolate the structured disulfide species as described above and place them under oxidizing conditions that maintain their folded structure (e.g., 100 mM DTT °x, pH 8.0, 15°). A small amount of reducing agent is added (e.g., 0.25 rnM DTT rea) as well; this concentration is chosen so that the structured species will not be reduced directly at a significant rate, but if the structured species should reshuffle to an unstructured species, the latter species will

This precaution allows us to distinguish the oxidations of the structured species from their interconversions by disulfide reshuffling.l16a The results indicate that the two more stable des species, des[40-95] and des[65-72], oxidize directly to the native protein, whereas the other two des species, des[26-84] and des[58-110], preferentially reshuffle to their unstructured ensembles. This is structurally plausible, since the former two disulfide bonds are relatively exposed in the native structure (and, hence, their thiols may be exposed by local unfolding events), whereas the two latter disulfide bonds are fully buried (and, hence, the exposure of their thiols may require global unfolding). These two types of structured disulfide species are denoted as disulfide-secure and disulfide-insecure, respectively, since the disulfide bonds remain buried while the thiol groups are exposed in the former case, but not in the latter. The directly oxidizing species des[40-95] exhibits a significantly increased oxidation rate relative to the unstructured intermediates, consistent with an enhanced proximity of these cysteines in the des species. However, no significant enhancement is observable in the des[65-72] species, possibly because the mixed disulfide bond may not be fully exposed, consistent with NMR studies 1°5 and the N' results 15 cited above. ~t~,~ These oxidative folding results (in which the exposure of thiol groups in the structured des species is the critical conformational event) are consistent with those of reductive unfolding (in which the exposure of disulfide bonds in the native protein is the critical conformational event). In particular, this agreement in the results between oxidative folding and reductive unfolding in the des[26-84] and des[58-110] species supports our hypothesis 6 that these species are not observed in reductive unfolding because of the high free-energy fluctuation (global unfolding) required to expose these disulfide bonds in the native protein, rather than because of their rapid subsequent reduction.

In its native state, RNase A has two cis-X-Pro peptide bonds (Tyr92-Pro 93 and Asn jl 3-Pro114) and two trans-X-Pro peptide bonds (Ly sal-Pro 42 and Va1116-ProII7). On unfolding, these four X-Pro peptide bonds undergo cis/trans-isomerization to form a heterogeneous mixture of 16 (24) isomeric states. (As defined here, the isomeric state of a protein specifies the cis/trans-isomers of its peptide bonds, especially X-Pro peptide bonds.) Under typical conditions, the isomerization between these states is much slower than the equilibration of conformations within any such state (in which only the ~b, ~p, and X dihedral angles are varied). Therefore, different isomeric states can be treated as though they were transient site-directed mutants. In particular, it is possible in principle to study the effects on conformational folding that result from the localized disruptions of the backbone conformation and side-chain packing caused by nonnative proline isomers. In contrast to normal

site-directed mutants, such "isomeric mutants" do not change the chemical bonding of the protein in any way and introduce no new atoms or interactions. However, although isomeric mutants are highly conservative by these criteria, they can lead to profound changes in the conformational folding, as demonstrated in RNase A. The sensitivity of conformational folding to the isomeric state is all the more remarkable, since prolines are generally not buried and do not belong to regular secondary structure elements. Hence, their isomerization should generally not disrupt the packing of any hydrophobic core(s). The effects of nonnative proline isomers on the conformational folding is often observable as a kinetic heterogeneity; in particular, slow-refolding phases are often attributed to the parallel conformational folding of different isomeric states. However, several key points should be noted. First, such kinetic heterogeneity can also arise from intermediates of purely conformational folding. Therefore, it is critical to establish that different isomeric states are indeed responsible for the observed kinetic heterogeneity and, more specifically, to determine which kinetic phases are due to proline isomerization. (It should be noted that a given kinetic phase may be composed of two or more phases of similar time constants; the component exponential phases can often be discerned by varying the conditions and/or by making specific mutations. 122) Second, it must be established whether these refolding phases are rate-limited by proline isomerization or whether the nonnative isomeric state merely retards the conformational folding. Third, it must be determined which isomeric state(s) is (are) responsible, i.e., to correlate the observed kinetics with specific structural features, namely, the nonnative proline isomers. Only in this way is it possible to clearly establish a link between specific isomeric states and specific conformational refolding behaviors, the goal of such studies. For clarity, the investigation of the conformational folding of the isomeric states of RNase A can be divided into five steps. In thefirst step, it is necessary to ascertain how many distinct refolding phases are present, i.e., how many subpopulations with distinct refolding behaviors exist in the equilibrium unfolded state. Hence, the conformational folding of RNase A was investigated under a wide variety of refolding conditions. Five exponential phases were discerned in these single-jump refolding experiments: Uvf, Uf, Urn, Us n, and Us I, corresponding to the very fast, fast, medium, slow, and very slow refolding phases. This kinetic heterogeneity was conjectured to result from nonnative proline isomers, 123 based on the following observations. First, each of these phases produces fully native protein, not a kinetic folding intermediate. Second, the equilibrium ratios of the amplitudes are independent of the refolding conditions (indicating that they correspond to a heterogeneity of the unfolded state) and agree in magnitude with those expected from the proline-isomerization hypothesis. Third, the interconversion rates under unfolding conditions between these phases are similar to that of 122D. Juminaga,W. J. Wedemeyer,and H. A. Scheraga,Biochemistry37, 11614(1998). 123j.

proline isomerization and exhibit several hallmarks of proline isomerization, e.g., an activation energy of 20 kcai/mol, catalysis by strong acids, and an indifference to pH and denaturant concentrations. In the second step, it is necessary to determine which prolines are responsible ("essential") for the kinetic heterogeneity observed in the first step, and which proline isomers are irrelevant to conformational folding. Hence, the singlejump refolding experiments were repeated on all possible single proline-to-alanme mutants of RNase A, i.e., P42A, P93A, P! 14A, and Pl 17A. It was shown that prolines-93, -114, and -117 are essential, i.e., significantly affect conformational folding, whereas Pro-42 appears to be nonessential. 71' 124 However, it is also possible that the relative cis fraction of t h e L y s 4 1 - P r o 42 peptide bond is too small under unfolding conditions to allow its effect on conformational folding to be resolved. Lys-Pro peptide bonds are well-known to favor the trans isomer heavily.125 1~7 In the third step, it is necessary to characterize how the refolding heterogeneity varies with the unfolding time, both to establish that proline isomerization is indeed responsible and to estimate the cis/trans ratios and isomerization rates of the essential prolines under unfolding conditions. Hence, double-jump refolding experiments were carried out on the wild-type protein, in which the folded native protein was unlolded for various times and then reintroduced to folding conditions. The amplitudes of the five refolding phases were monitored as a function of the unfolding time. These data were fit exhaustively to all possible kinetic models ol three independently isomerizing prolines (so-called "box" models). The resulting best-fit box model is shown in Fig. 6, along with the equilibrium percentages of each isomeric state and the time constants for the cis/trans isomerization for each proline under unfolding conditions. In thefimrth step, it is necessary to connect the prolines of the kinetic box model with the essential prolines identified in the second step. To this end, independent fluorescence assays of the isomerizing prolines were developed.122 These assays depend on the change in fluorescence of a tyrosine residue due to the isomerization of an adjacent proline, possibly due to ring-ring interactions 21' lzs, 129~ the nearby 40-95 disulfide bond does not contribute to the quenching.tlJ The time constants measured directly by these assays ~22 agreed with those determined in the kinetic fitting of the third step, 29 providing independent evidence supporting the box model.

FIG.6. The best-fitting "box" model for the isomerization of Pro-93, Pro-114, and Pro-117 under unfolding conditions.

In the fifth step, the box model (with identified prolines) should be crossvalidated. Hence, the double-jump experiments were repeated for the proline-toalanine mutants. 71 It should be noted that most, but not all, of these double-jump experiments agreed with the proposed box model. In particular, contrary to the box model of Fig. 6, the P93A and P117A mutants both exhibited a Um refolding phase. However, in other respects, the mutant data agreed well; for example, the P114A mutant exhibited no Uvf refolding phase, and the P117A mutant exhibited no Us I refolding phase. The time constants also agreed roughly with those predicted from the box model. The conclusion of these studies was that nonnative isomers of Pro-114, Pro-117, and Pro-93 cause increasing disruption of conformational folding. However, most isomeric states do fold conformationally (i.e., their folded state is still thermodynamically more stable than their unfolded state), except for those states in which both Pro-93 and Pro-117 have adopted nonnative isomers, Specifically, the Uvf, Uf, Urn, and Us u and Us I refolding phases have been assigned as follows: Uvf corresponds to the single native isomeric state. Uf corresponds to the single isomeric state in which only Pro-114 is nonnative trans. Um corresponds to the two isomeric states in which Pro-93 is native cis, Pro-117 is nonnative cis and Pro-114 may be either cis or trans. Us n corresponds to the two isomer states in which Pro-93 is nonnative trans, Pro-117 is native trans, and Pro-114 may be either cis or trans. Finally, Us I corresponds to the two isomeric states in which Pro-93 is nonnative trans, Pro-117 is nonnative cis, and Pro-114 may be cis or trans. It is remarkable that a nonnative isomer of Pro-93 slows folding roughly 500-fold (usn), although it is located in a flexible loop region, whereas a nonnative isomer of Pro-117 retards folding roughly 25-fold (Urn), although it is fully

buried in the major hydrophobic core. 29'vl This indicates that the major fl hairpin is critical for conformational folding, consistent with other mutagenesis studiesfl9 It seems likely that the disruption of conformational folding is due primarily to the anomalous backbone structure of the trans X-Pro bond, since the local region is not tightly packed in the native strtucture and since cleavage of the nearby 40-95 disulfide bond does not affect conformational folding significantly (unpublished results). Equally remarkably, the native peptide bond at Tyr9~--Pro remains cis 93 even when Pro-93 is mutated to alanine. 38"4°71 The extraordinary sensitivity of the conformational folding to the isomeric state of Pro-93 casts doubt on the recently proposed smooth funnel models of protein folding, which propose that there are no well-defined pathways for folding. In particular, these models predict that small structural changes are incapable of slowing folding significantly since, if one pathway is blocked, many other pathways remain open. This is evidently contradicted by our results for the nonnative isomer of t h e T y r 9 2 - P r o 93 peptide bond. To quantify the effects of nonnative isomeric states on the conformational folding, a (I)isomer value could be defined, in analogy with q~F13° and the (I)link value discussed below, 6 where q~i~omeris defined as AAG°Ts_u/AAG°N.u and these AAG°'s represent the changes in tree energy differences associated with the change in the isomeric state of the X-Pro peptide bond. Values of ~isomerclose to one (zero) indicate that the isomeric states is critical (not critical) for conformational folding. Admittedly, the five-step protocol described above is a rather complicated procedure to assess the effects of nonnative isomeric states on the conformational folding, although it requires only relatively simple kinetic and mutagenesis steps. Moreover, the anomalous Um observations of the P93A and P 117A mutants point out that its results are not absolutely certain. A more direct but technically more challenging method is to use the semisynthetic methods described above to introduce cis- and trans-locked analogs of prolines into the protein. In principle, no proline isomerization would occur in such isomerically locked molecules; hence, the conformational folding of pure isomeric states could be determined directly.

by assumption, is isomerically pure), the protein is jumped to strongly unfolding conditions (e.g., 4.2 M GdnHC1 at pH 2, 15° for RNase A), in which the conformational unfolding proceeds much more rapidly than the proline isomerization. The protein is held under these conditions long enough to allow complete unfolding of the protein but not long enough to populate any nonnative isomeric state significantly (roughly 0.8 s for RNase A at 15°). The protein is then retumed to folding conditions and its refolding is monitored by sundry probes such as absorbance, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and H/D exchange. By repeating such experiments under different conditions and with different structural probes, the conformational folding of the pure native isomeric state can be investigated. The double-jump protocol has been combined with several structural probes to study the Uvf refolding phase of RNase A. The pH and GdnHC1 dependence of the refolding kinetics indicated that a conformational intermediate (denoted I~) is populated in refolding.132 The intermediate appears to be favored under stabilizing conditions, e.g., at low denaturant conditions or neutral pH. 132 Subsequent circular dichroism (CD) studies revealed a burst phase 87 that is not apparent in the wildtype protein by absorbance or fluorescence under similar conditions. Analogous experiments on the fully reduced protein R suggest that similar amounts of local secondary structure are induced in Uvf and R by the jump to physiological folding conditions. 6'88 H/D exchange experiments have suggested that the amide protons of the minor hydrophobic core (near the 26-84 disulfide bond) become strongly protected, whereas those of the major hydrophobic core (near the 58-110 disulfide bond) receive medium protection and others receive little or no protection, a33 The burst phase may even be observed by tyrosine absorbance in the wild-type protein if the refolding is carded out in the presence of sulfate (unpublished results). Site-directed mutants also indicate the importance of the minor hydrophobic core in the refolding of Uvf. The Y25F and Y97F mutants slow the folding drastically,29 suggesting that these residues are required for this folding. The Y92W mutant 67 exhibits a burst phase by fluorescence, a relatively small burst phase in the refolding of Uvf, and a larger burst phase in single-jump refolding experiments from the equilibrium unfolded state. Subsequent experiments (unpublished results) have indicated that this fluorescence burst phase is composed of two well-resolved exponentials on the submillisecond time scale, plus a still-unresolved burst phase that likely corresponds to ring-ring interactions between the tryptophan and the adjacent proline.

kinetically from all other phases, e.g., the Us ll phase of RNase A. This simplified protocol is much more economical than the double-jump protocol in terms of the amount of protein required. However, this single-jump protocol is also less certain, since there is no guarantee that the phase being examined is indeed a single phase corresponding to a structurally homogeneous refolding. For example, multiple isomeric states may refold along structurally different pathways, but at rates so similar that their separate phases cannot be separated. Such a confounding of structurally heterogeneous refolding phases may explain the apparently anomalous results observed using this protocol in the Us n phase of RNase A, 33 consistent with other experiments indicating that the Us u phase comprises the refolding of two distinct isomeric states. 29't22 The conformational folding of Us If has been studied by pulsed H/D exchange methods and correlated with optical probes. 32'33 The results suggest that the C-terminal, predominantly /4-sheet half of RNase A is almost fully formed in an intermediate of conformational folding, and that the rate-determining step consists of the ordering of the N-terminal, predominantly u-helical half onto the /4 sheet. The conformational refolding of Us II has also been studied using a novel crosslinking protocol. 69 Lysines-7 and -41 were cross-linked through their N ~ atoms using 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. The cross-linked protein exhibits the same native structure as wild-type RNase A, 37 and similar relblding phases. 7° The crosslinked protein is thermodynamically much more stable than wild-type RNase A, ~'~ and this change in stability appears to result largely from entropic not enthalpic factors, consistent with the high conformational lability observed in the loop region (residues 16-23) and the close similarity between RNase A and S.

It is worth noting that the normative cis isomer of Pro-ll7 (which is fully buried in the major hydrophobic core) causes less disruption of conformational folding than the nonnative trans isomer of Pro-93, which occurs in a relatively exposed, flexible segment of the protein. Similarly, the P117A mutant causes a large increase in the conformational unfolding rate but relatively little change in the refolding rates, 71 indicating a low q~F value.13° However, the local amide protons in the C-terminal hairpin are well protected against H/D exchange. 32'33 Taken together, these data suggest that the C-terminal fl hairpin has formed in the folding transition state but that the major (58-110) hydrophobic core has not yet become packed. The refolding of Us I appears to be rate-limited by proline isomerization. 72 Hence, the conformational folding of the corresponding isomeric states cannot be studied, although the results indicate that nonnative isomers of Pro-93 and Pro-117 suffice to make the native state thermodynamically unstable relative to the unfolded state.

Conformational Folding Experiments on Homologous Proteins
Experiments similar to those described above may be carried out on homologous proteins. RNase A belongs to a large homologous superfamily for which more than 40 members have been sequenced, 141 including angiogenin, frog onconase, and bovine seminal ribonuclease. These ribonucleases are also similar to the family of microbial ribonucleases, which includes ribonuclease U2, ribonuclease T1, ribonuclease Sa, and barnase. The number of disulfide bonds in these proteins ranges from zero (e.g., barnase) up to four (e.g., RNase A). Comparative studies of the conformational and oxidative folding of these ribonucleases will be helpful in determining which features of RNase A folding are specific to that protein and which are representative of a broader class of proteins. This in turn should help to uncover the general principles governing protein folding. In particular, such experiments will help determine how the polypeptide chain may possibly fold progressively along multiple pathways, beginning with local folding in hydrophobic regions known as CFISs, 27'28'142 which promote the formation of

medium- and long-range interresidue interactions in subsequent conformational stages. This consecutive formation of ordered structures (and consequently the interactions that lead to them) determines the pathways along which the polypeptide folds to the native protein. 143'144 By observing the development of ordered structure along these pathways, the interresidue interactions that determine this progression and, thus, the final folded native structure can be characterized. Such comparisons of conformational folding have been carried out for several homologs of RNase A. 145 These studies indicated that homologous proteins with even relatively low sequence identity nevertheless exhibit similar folding kinetics and folding phases, suggesting that they are conformationally analogous. These homologous protein studies also demonstrated that the introduction of new proline residues may induce new slow-refolding phases that are rate-limited by proline isomerization, as in porcine ribonuclease A.146 Such a "proline-scanning" method may reveal critical regions that must be structured in the transition state of conformational folding. In particular, proline substitution could disrupt regular secondary structure regardless of its isomer, while the isomeric dependence could identify critical turn structures.

In this section, we discuss the factors affecting the choice of redox reagent and the experimental conditions (especially pH), as well as the methods for quenching the disulfide-bond reactions and subsequent chemical analysis. It should be noted that these methods work well for RNase A, but may not always be directly applicable to other proteins.
Redox Reagent

The two types of redox reagents most commonly used are linear disulfide reagents such as glutathione and cyclic disulfide reagents such as dithiothreitol (DTT). Air oxidation is not generally used, because it is complicated by metal-ion catalysis and its rate is difficult to control precisely; indeed, oxygen is generally eliminated from the reactions (e.g., by sparging with inert gases such as argon) for the same reasons. Novel redox reagents are an ongoing area of re search. ~ 47,148 143S. Tanakaand H. A. Scheraga,Macromolecules 10, 291 (1977). 144G. Ntmethy and H. A. Scheraga,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.

We presently favor the cyclic redox reagent DTT because such rapidly recyclizing reagents ensure that mixed disulfide species are populated to negligible levels. This simplifies the interpretation of the experimental results, since one need not consider the structure and folding behavior of the covalently modified proteins with mixed disulfide bonds. By contrast, linear redox reagents are potentially problematic since such mixed disulfide species can be extremely numerous for proteins with many cysteines 149-151 and, hence, such species may predominate. Moreover, at high concentrations of the linear redox reagent, fully blocked species may be populated, i.e., those in which all free thiol groups are involved in mixed disulfide bonds. Despite these difficulties, linear redox reagents have several advantages. For example, glutathione is a much stronger oxidizing agent than DTT and is likely the chief redox reagent for oxidative folding in vivo. The protein itself may act as a redox reagent 152 through intermolecular disproportionation reactions such as 3S + 3S ~-- 2S + 4S. However, the effects of such disproportionation reactions should be generally negligible in the presence of a redox reagent or at most physiological concentrations of the protein.

Experimental Conditions, especially pH
The experimental conditions are often dictated by the scientific question being addressed in the redox experiments. However, it should be borne in mind that changes in the experimental conditions can profoundly affect the regeneration of the native protein, both by influencing the conformational stability of disulfide intermediates and by changing the relative rate of reduction/oxidation and disulfide reshuffling. Since many disulfide intermediates are unstructured (and, thus, have relatively low solubility), the conditions should be chosen to obtain a high rate of producing structured species such as the native protein, in order to minimize aggregation. High pH (pH _> typical cysteine pKa ~ 8.7) may be helpful in accelerating oxidative folding by increasing the concentration of the (reactive) thiolate anion relative to the (unreactive) thiol group. High pH may also have the advantage of destabilizing metastable (kinetically trapped) species, since the burial of a charged thiolate group is strongly disfavored. 153 However, higher pH may also have unwanted side effects such as deamidation, 14 conformational destabilization of structured species, and aggregation/polymerization, especially for proteins with high

Disulfide-bond regeneration can be arrested at different times, either by acid quenching or by a rapid thiol-blocking agent such as aminoethylmethane thiosulfonate (AEMTS) 154 and similar thiosulfonates. Acid quenching relies on the slowness of thiol/disulfide exchange at low pH (only the thiolate anion is reactive m~ ) and has the advantage that the protein itself is not modified chemically. However, we prefer AEMTS blocking, which is exceptionally rapid compared to other thiol-blocking reagents (105 times faster than iodoacetate155). AEMTS blocking facilitates the subsequent fractionation (by adding a positively charged cysteamine group for every blocked thiol) and does not require the maintenance of low pH during the subsequent analysis. Unfortunately, neither acid quenching nor AEMTS blocking is ideal, since both methods may perturb the conformational structure of the intermediate disulfide species (relative to its structure under oxidative folding conditions near neutral pH). Common thiol-blocking reagents such as iodoacetate and iodoacetamide should be used with caution in oxidative folding experiments, since they are often too slow to prevent disulfide reshuffling during the blocking reaction. These reagents can produce results that disagree with the majority of other methods, even for relatively simple measurements such as the Keqbetween DTT and glutathione. 15~,.i_s, These blocking reagents have also produced anomalous results for the oxidative folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), when compared to experiments carried out under identical conditions using acid quenching, l l7,158 At higher concentrations, these reagents may also chemically modify other residues of the protein. 159 When using reversible chemical blocking agents such as AEMTS, sufficiently high concentrations of the blocking agent must be used to ensure that all the thiols are rapidly blocked. If the blocking of thiols is too slow, the blocking agent may act as an oxidizing agent; the unblocked thiols may attack the disulfide bond of the blocked thiols and form an intraprotein disulfide bond. Therefore, it is crucial to establish experimentally that a sufficiently high concentration of the blocking agent has been used. 1~4T. W. Bruice and G. L. Kenyon,J. Protein Chem. 1, 47 (1982). 155D.

Analysis of lntermediates
The use of a chemical blocking group such as the cysteamine of AEMTS facilitates the subsequent analysis of the quenched disulfide ensembles, since it introduces a positively charged group to every free thiol present prior to blocking. For example, ion-exchange chromatography can be used to separate the intermediates by charge; ion-exchange columns show very little loss of protein and, hence, the measured concentrations of the eluted fractions can be regarded as quantitatively accurate. The individual fractions can also be collected and analyzed to determine the number of thiol groups and disulfide bonds, 160 using a novel methodology that exploits the AEMTS blocking. 161The results clearly indicate that the cation-exchange columns separate the blocked disulfide species according to the number of disulfide bonds. Ion-exchange columns can also be used at pH 5.0 to isolate unblocked disulfide species. However, a wide spectrum of analytic separation methods can be applied, e.g., 2D gel electrophoresis, 162 capillary electrophoresis, 163 gel filtration, TM and reversed-phase columns. 165 The structured species can be separated from the unstructured ensembles using the reduction-pulse protocol 26'113 described above in the Preparative Methods section. Peptide mapping methods can be used to determine the disulfide bonding present in a disulfide species or ensemble. 166

Typical Protocolfor Oxidative Folding
A typical oxidative folding study might be carded out as follows. The fully reduced protein may be prepared by incubating purified protein with a strong reducing reagent (e.g., 100 mM DTT red) and a strong denaturant (e.g., 6 M GdnHC1) that unfolds the protein, ensuring that its disulfide bonds are exposed to the reducing reagent. The use of a denaturant is critical, since the disulfide bonds of many proteins are well protected and are reduced extremely slowly under folding conditions. Unfortunately, this precaution is not always taken, leading to some erroneous conclusions. 59'83,84 Oxidative folding may be initiated by introducing the fully reduced protein to conditions that favor conformational folding and the formation of disulfide bonds (e.g., 100 mMDTT °x at pH 8 and 15-37°). Aliquots are withdrawn at various times after initiating oxidative folding, and thiol/disulfide exchange is arrested by acid quenching or AEMTS blocking. The mixture of disulfide species is then fractionated by reversed-phase or ion-exchange HPLC. Structured species with protected

Introduction Human pancreatic ribonuclease (HP-RNase, RNase 1, EC 3.1.27.5) is a secreted ribonuclease that belongs to the ribonuclease superfamily. This enzyme is considered the human counterpart of the well-known bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) with which it shares 70% sequence identity and the ability Io cleave RNA specifically on the 3' side of pyrimidine bases. Both enzymes show an increased activity with poly(C) over that with poly(U) and also an optimal activity near pH 8.0. However, HP-RNase presents a higher activity both on double-stranded RNA and on destabilizing DNA. Ribonucleases are considered potential alternative toxins because of their ability to degrade RNA molecules. As toxins most of these enzymes catalytically abolish protein synthesis when they translocate into the cytosol. I Onconase. a ribonuclease isolated from oocytes of Rana pipiens, is of outstanding interest because of its preferential cytotoxicity to cancer cells. At present il is in phase 11/III
