In light of accumulating evidence that aggressive LDL-lowering therapy may offer increased protection against coronary heart disease, we undertook the design and synthesis of a novel series of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors based upon a substituted pyrazole template. Optimizing this series using both structure-based design and molecular property considerations afforded a class of highly efficacious and hepatoselective inhibitors resulting in the identification of (3R,5R)-7-[2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-4-isopropyl-5-(4-methyl-benzylcarbamoyl)-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic (PF-3052334) as a candidate for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
Introduction Coronary heart disease (CHD)a is a leading cause of death, and it represents an increasing burden on healthcare resources worldwide.1 Epidemiological evidence indicates that hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor for the CHD;2 consequently, significant efforts have been undertaken to mitigate this condition. Currently, the most common method of treating hypercholesterolemia is the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins. These drugs block the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis, ultimately resulting in up-regulation of the LDL-receptor and the clearing of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles from the bloodstream.3 As a class, statins have proven remarkably safe and effective for both primary prevention of coronary heart disease and secondary prevention of coronary events.4 Over the past five years, results from several large clinical trials including TNT, MIRACAL, IDEAL, and PROVE-IT have suggested that increasingly aggressive LDL-C lowering therapy may offer further primary and secondary prevention benefits relative to previous, less-aggressive treatment standards.5 Acknowledging these findings, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP-ATP-III) recently modified its treatment guidelines for patients at risk for CHD. It is now recommended that the highest risk patients achieve a treatment goal of LDL-C < 70 mg/dl, down from the previous treatment goal of 100 mg/dl for this patient group.6 Moreover, other researchers have suggested that optimal LDL-C levels to prevent atherosclerosis and CHD might be even lower, in the range of 50­70 mg/dl.7

Achieving such aggressive LDL-C reductions in patients typically requires the use of high-dose statins alone or in combination with complementary agents, such as the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe.5,8 A potential limitation of highdose statin therapy is statin-induced myalgia, the muscle pain or weakness that sometimes accompanies statin therapy. While the overall incidence of myalgia is low (2­7% of patients in clinical trials), the likelihood of occurrence increases with drug dose, and it can be a key factor in preventing patient compliance with a treatment regimen.9a Physiologically, the mechanism of statin-induced myalgia is complex, but thought to involve, in part, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in nonhepatic tissues (particularly muscle), thereby disrupting the biosynthesis of isoprenoid-derived biomolecules important in post-translational protein modification (i.e., prenylation) and electron transport (i.e., ubiquinone).9 Fortunately, there is evidence that the likelihood of statininduced myalgia can be reduced by targeting HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to hepatic tissues and limiting peripheral exposure.10 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the hepatoselectivity of a given HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is related to its degree of lipophilicity.10,11 In general, lipophilic statins tend to achieve higher levels of exposure in nonhepatic peripheral tissues, whereas more hydrophilic statins tend to be more hepatoselective. This trend is illustrated experimentally in Table 1, where three benchmark statins spanning a range of lipophilicity were evaluated for their ability to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in both primary rat hepatocyte and rat myocyte (muscle) cells, with the ratio of these two values taken as a measure of hepatoselectivity. As shown and consistent with the earlier findings of others,12 lipophilic statins such as cerivastatin (which was withdrawn from the market due to high incidences of myalgia and rhabdomyloysis) tend to be nonselective, whereas more hydrophilic statins such as pravastatin and rosuvastatin are hepatoselective. These differences in hepatoselectivity can be rationalized by the fact that lipophilic statins passively and nonselectively diffuse into both hepatocyte and nonhepatocyte cells, while hydrophilic statins (which are

inherently less membrane-permeable) rely to a greater extent on active transport into hepatocyte cells to exert their effects.10,13 Pravastatin and rosuvastatin, among other statins, have been shown to be substrates for active transport via members of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family of membrane transporters, which are principally expressed in hepatocytes.10c,13­15 One potential limitation of achieving high hepatoselectivity via reduced inhibitor lipophilicity, however, is that as a compound becomes more hydrophilic and, therefore, less permeable, its oral absorption is typically impeded (provided that no compensating transport mechanism is present in the gastrointestinal system); consequently, achieving the appropriate level of inhibitor lipophilicity is pivotal to balancing selectivity and efficacy. To meet the challenge of finding novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with the efficacy and tolerability profiles needed to help patients achieve aggressive LDL reduction goals, we undertook a discovery effort to identify a novel class of inhibitors with best-in-class preclinical efficacy and hepatoselectivity. We strategically envisioned meeting this objective through modification of the atorvastatin (1) template. Specifically, we sought to replace the pyrrole core of atorvastatin with alternative five-membered heterocycles of lower inherent lipophilicity and/or substitution.16 Of particular interest was a pyrazole core system, as exemplified by isomeric prototypes 2 and 3 (Figure 1). Synthesis of 2 and 3 (vida infra), followed by evaluation against HMG-CoA reductase, revealed that pyrazole 2 (IC50 ) 4.7 nM) had activity comparable to the parent atorvastatin (IC50 ) 12 nM) whereas regioisomer 3 (IC50 ) 520 nM) was substantially less active. We subsequently undertook structure­activity studies on 2, focusing on modifica-

tion of the amide motif, to optimize its hepatoselectivity and in vivo efficacy. Chemistry Substituted pyrazole analogs for the current studies were synthesized as outlined in Schemes 1­4. Initial efforts focused on construction of a heterocyclic core, which could be utilized as a versatile intermediate for subsequent analog synthesis. As shown in Scheme 1, 4-fluoroaniline (4) was first converted to its corresponding diazonium salt by treatment with NaNO2/HCl, and this intermediate was reacted with methyl 2-chloroacetoacetate to give hydrazonoyl chloride 5.17 Treatment of 5 with Ag2CO3 resulted in in situ generation of nitrilimine 6, which was engaged in a stereoselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with E-enone 8 as the dipolarophile to provide a 5:1 mixture of regioisomeric dihydropyrazoles, with 9 as the major regioisomer.17,18 The regiochemistry of 9 was confirmed upon ceric ammonium nitrate oxidation to pyrazole 10, a crystalline solid that was subjected to small molecule X-ray analysis, as shown in Scheme 1. With pyrazole 10 in hand, inhibitor 2 was completed, as outlined in Scheme 2. The benzyl ester of 10 was first converted to the carboxaldehyde of 11 using a three-step sequence that included (a) hydrogenolysis to a carboxylic acid; (b) reduction to the corresponding alcohol with BH3 · THF;19 and (c) oxidation to an aldehyde with Dess-Martin periodinate. The methyl ester of 11 was saponified with aqueous NaOH to provide carboxylic acid 12, which was engaged in an EDCI-mediated coupling with benzyl amine to provide amide 13. Attachment of the 3,5dihydroxyhexanoic acid side chain onto the pyrazole core was anticipated to be accomplished via a Wittig olefination reaction that first required conversion of 13 into an appropriate ylide precursor.20 Hence, the carboxaldehyde of 13 was reduced to

the corresponding alcohol and then treated with Ph3P · HBr at elevated temperature to afford phosphonium salt 14 in excellent yield. In parallel, Swern oxidation of commercially available alcohol 15 provided aldehyde 16 as a suitable coupling partner.21 In the olefination event, phosphonium salt 14 was deprotonated with LiHMDS at low temperature, and a solution of aldehyde 16 was added to provide olefin 17 in moderate yield as an inconsequential mixture of cis/trans isomers. Treatment of 17 with HCl/MeOH effected cleavage of the acetonide protecting group, and the side chain olefin was then hydrogenated over 10% Pd/C to afford 18. Finally, the terminal ester of 18 was saponified with aqueous NaOH to provide compound 2 as a carboxylate sodium salt. Scheme 3 illustrates the synthesis of inhibitor 3, a regioisomer of inhibitor 2, utilizing minor modifications to the synthetic route previously described. Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ester of 10 provided the corresponding carboxylic acid 19, which was subjected to an EDCI-mediated coupling with benzyl amine to give benzyl amide 20. The methyl ester of 20 was then saponified, and the resulting carboxylic acid reduced with BH3 · THF to afford alcohol 22. Treatment of 22 with PBr3 converted this alcohol to an alkyl bromide that was then reacted with Ph3P at elevated temperature, resulting in the formation of phosphonium salt 23 in good yield. Notably, this two-step conversion of 22f23 was found to be more efficient than the single-step sequence previously described for 13f14 (Scheme 2) owing to the extended reaction time required for this later transformation. Finally, using the same four-step sequence (Wittig reaction, acetonide deprotection, hydrogenation, and saponification) described above, phosphonium salt 23 was converted to 3, which was isolated as its carboxylate sodium salt. While the synthetic routes described in Schemes 2 and 3 provided facile assess to many of the analogs described herein, a second route, employing an alternative method of side chain attachment, was also utilized for the synthesis of selected analogs. This alternative route is outlined in Scheme 4 for the synthesis of inhibitor 32. As shown, amide 26 was prepared as previously described and engaged in a Wittig olefination reaction with stabilized ylide 27 (prepared according to the method of Konoike22) to provide E-olefin 28 in good overall yield. The TBS-protected side chain hydroxyl of 28 was then liberated by treatment with aqueous HF to provide -hydroxy ketone 29, which was subjected to a stereoselective syn-reduction with

Et2BOMe and NaBH4 to produce syn-diol 30.23 Finally, the synthesis was completed by hydrogenation of the side chain olefin followed by saponification of the terminal ester to provide inhibitor 32 as its carboxylate sodium salt. The synthetic routes outlined in Schemes 14 were subsequently utilized for the preparation of all analogs in these studies. Results and Discussion Structure­Activity Studies. Our SAR studies in this pyrazole series focused on optimizing potency, hepatoselectivity, and in vivo efficacy; importantly and as discussed below, achieving the necessary balance between these parameters required manipulation of analog structure and lipophilicity. All new analogs were first evaluated in an HMG-CoA reductase enzyme inhibition assay. Additionally, the ability of analogs to block cholesterol synthesis in both rat hepatocyte and myocyte cell lines was evaluated; moreover, comparison of these two values was utilized as a measurement of hepatoselectivity. As a guideline, inhibitors with potent hepatocyte activity (hepatocyte IC50 < 10 nM) and good hepatoselectivity (myocyte/hepatocyte ratio preferably >1000) were selected for further evaluation in both acute and chronic animal efficacy models. Our acute model, performed in hamsters, measured a compound's ability to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. To get a preliminary assessment of a compound's duration of action, two time points were measured in separate animal groups. In one group (denoted as t ) 2­4 h group), animals were dosed with drug (10 mpk) at t ) 0 h then given an intraperitoneal injection of 14C sodium acetate at t ) 2 h, and finally, blood samples were obtained at t ) 4 h and analyzed for 14C cholesterol levels, which were compared to untreated control animals to determine percent inhibition of acute cholesterol synthesis. In a second group (denoted as t ) 4­6 h group), animals were again dosed with drug (10 mpk) at t ) 0 h then given an intraperitoneal injection of 14C sodium acetate at t ) 4 h, and finally, blood samples were obtained at t ) 6 h and analyzed for 14C cholesterol levels, which were compared to untreated control animals. Comparison of the results from these two assays afforded a preliminary measure of a compound's duration of action, which was utilized for prioritizing compounds for further evaluation. Based upon these acute efficacy data, compounds of interest were then selected for evaluation in a chronic (7 day) LDL lowering study that was performed in chow-fed guinea pigs. This chronic study was initially performed at a single dose of drug (10 or 20 mpk),

results were compared against the benchmark compound rosuvastatin, and analogs with comparable activity were then evaluated in full dose response studies. As shown in Table 2, preliminary SAR efforts focused on evaluating substituted secondary benzyl amides. Because the prototype compound 2, which contained an unsubstituted benzyl amide, lacked sufficient hepatoselectivity (myocyte IC50/hepatocyte IC50 < 1000) substituents were added to reduce lipophilicity and, consequently, improve selectivity. As illustrated, compounds 35­38 demonstrated sufficient hepatoselectivity to warrant acute in vivo evaluation. Preliminary acute in vivo evaluation was done at the t ) 6 h time point with actives (defined as -10% or greater inhibition) then also evaluated at the t ) 4 h time point. As shown, analogs 35 and 36 both exhibited good acute efficacy, whereas the more hydrophilic compounds 37 and 38 were not acutely efficacious. Interestingly, inspection of the analogs of Table 2 confirmed that, within this limited series, hepatoselectivity generally increased as lipophilicity decreased (with the exception of 35); additionally, acute in vivo efficacy tended to also diminish as inhibitor lipophilicity

decreased (particularly for 37 and 38), presumably as a result of reduced oral absorption. A second type of amide modification explored was Nalkylation, as highlighted in Table 3. Comparison of secondary amide 2 to its N-methylated tertiary amide counterpart 39 revealed that the two compounds had similar potency in hepatocyctes [IC50 ) 0.3 nM (2) vs 0.2 nM (39)], but interestingly, the N-methyl derivative 39 was 30-fold less active against myocytes [IC50 ) 100 nM (2) vs 3100 nM (39)]. In addition to its increased hepatoselectivity, N-methyl amide 39 also exhibited good acute in vivo efficacy, as illustrated in Table 3. Increasing the size of the N-alkyl group to ethyl (40) and i-propyl (41) resulted in decreased potency for inhibition of hepatocyte cholesterol synthesis. To further capitalize on the selectivity and efficacy observed for compound 39, we next sought to investigate the effect of further substitution on this analog, as shown in Table 4, where a series of alkyl, alkoxy, and fluoro groups were installed at the ortho, meta, and para position of the benzyl ring. In nearly all cases, these compounds had excellent potency and selectivity; however, optimal acute in vivo efficacy was observed for

compounds 48 and 49 bearing 2,4-F and a 2,3-F substituent patterns, respectively. A final type of analog modification focused on the benzylic position of benzyl amide 37, as illustrated in Table 5. Specifically, we sought to understand the effect of R-methylation of the benzyl amide, as illustrated by stereosiomers 50 and 51. While 50 demonstrated superior activity relative to its diastereomeric counterpart 51, its selectivity and efficacy were similar to the unsubstituted case 39; however, structural biology studies of 50 revealed an interesting observation. Figure 2 shows an X-ray structure of compound 50 bound to the active site of HMG-CoA reductase.24 While the compound binds in a mode consistent with other known HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,25 inspection of the relative positions of the N-methyl and R-methyl groups reveal that (in the inhibitor's bound conformation) these two groups experience a steric interaction that is intermediate between gauche and eclipsing. This observation suggested that the bound configuration of 50 was not a low energy conformation. Moreover, it appeared that the two alkyl groups might be conveniently tethered into a ring to restrict the amide motif into its active conformation. To evaluate this hypothesis, racemic 2-phenyl pyrrolidine, 2-phenyl

piperidine, and 3-phenyl piperidine were utilized to prepare 52, 53, and 54, respectively, as 1:1 diastereomeric mixtures. Among these compounds, 54 provided the best combination of potency, selectivity, and efficacy. Subsequently, the two individual stereoisomers of 54 were independently prepared and assayed, resulting in the identification of 55 as the more active component. Encouragingly, this compound had outstanding acute efficacy; unfortunately, the selectivity of 55 against the myocycte cell line was somewhat diminished. Chronic Efficacy Studies To Enable Candidate Selection. In an effort to better evaluate the therapeutic potential of this series of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, analogs demonstrating good selectivity and acute efficacy were selected for chronic in vivo characterization. Specifically, these compounds were evaluated for their ability to lower LDL cholesterol in a chowfed guinea pigs over a 7 day period with daily oral administration of drug at a single dose (10 or 20 mpk). Efficacy of the new analogs was benchmarked against rosuvastatin, and compounds with comparable single-dose efficacy were selected for dose-response studies. As shown in Table 6, analogs 35, 36, and 49 demonstrated chronic efficacy comparable to rosuvastatin at the dose evaluated, while the remaining compounds were less active. As a result of these single dose data 35, 36, and 49 were then evaluated in dose-response studies. During the dose-response studies of these three compounds, compound 36 was found to have inferior efficacy relative to the benchmark rosuvastatin (data not shown) and was therefore discarded. By contrast, both 35 and 49 demonstrated efficacy comparable to if not better than rosuvastatin. Unfortunately, difficulties obtaining a suitable crystal form of inhibitor 49 prevented further development of this compound. Encouragingly, as shown in Figure 3, comparison of the dose response of 35 (represented as PF-3052334) versus that of rosuvastatin and pravastatin revealed that with an ED50 ) 3.6 mpk it was approximately 3 times more efficacious than rosuvastatin (ED50 ) 9.3 mpk) and 27 times more efficacious than pravastatin (ED50 ) 100 mpk) in this animal model. Considering both the good hepatoselectivity (>800-fold) and the excellent LDL-lowering efficacy of 35, this compound was advanced forward as a candidate that is currently under evaluation in a phase I trial, the results of which will be reported separately. Retrospective Analysis of Lipophilicity and Selectivity. As described at the outset, a key element of our current strategy was to understand the relationship between inhibitor lipophilicity and hepatoselectivity and to use the former as a prediction of the latter to enable efficient analog design and prioritization. During the course of our studies, we generated a cohort of pyrazole analogs that spanned a range of lipophilicity (cLogD ) -0.01 to -2.25) but still maintained relatively similar inherent potencies for inhibition of the HMG-CoA enzyme reductase enzyme. Furthermore, for each compound, we had a hepatoselectivity ratio based upon comparison of hepatocyte and myocyte inhibition values. With this data in hand, we were positioned to undertake a retrospective analysis on the series to determine whether or not cLogD was predictive of hepatoselectivity for analogs in this series. This analysis is presented graphically in Figure 4 where a subset of analogs with HMGCoA IC50 ) 1­10 nM26 was utilized to generate plots of cLogD versus log (myocyte IC50) [A], log (hepatocyte IC50) [B], and log (myocyte/hepatocyte) [C]. Several correlations were noted and exemplified with trend lines on the plots. First, as exemplified in Plot [A], myocyte potency decreased with increasing inhibitor hydrophilicity (i.e., lower cLogD). This is consistent with the fact that membrane permeability typically decreases

as inhibitor hydrophilicity increases; therefore, if these inhibitors penetrate the myocytes via passive diffusion (as anticipated), one would expect the correlation that was observed.27 By contrast, examination of Plot [B] reveals that hepatocyte potency was somewhat independent of inhibitor lipophilicity. In fact, there was a slight trend suggesting that cellular potency in hepatocyctes actually increased as inhibitor hydrophilicity increased. This is counter to a passive diffusion model and suggests that these inhibitors are likely experiencing active transport into the hepatocyte cells. Lastly, the utility of cLogD as a tool for predicting hepatoselectivity in the current series is evaluated in Plot [C]. As shown, a modest correlation exits (R2 ) 0.6) between cLogD and the hepatoselectivity (defined as myocyte/hepatocyte activity) such that predicted lipophilicity might serve as a tool for prioritizing future analogs. Conclusion In response to the need for increasingly effective yet welltolerated HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, we have described herein the synthesis and evaluation of a series of hepatoselective and highly efficacious pyrazole-based inhibitors. These efforts resulted in the identification of 35 as a candidate for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Finally, through a retrospective analysis, we demonstrated the utility of calculated lipophi-

licity as a design tool for predicting the hepatoselectivity of analogs in this series. Experimental Section

Isolation of Rat Liver Microsomes. Male Charles River Sprague­Dawley rats were fed with 2.5% cholestyramine in rat chow diets for 7 days before sacrificing. Livers were minced and

homogenized in a sucrose homogenizing solution in an ice bath. Homogenates were diluted into a final volume of 200 mL and centrifuged for 0.25 h with a Sorvall centrifuge at 5 °C, 10000 rpm (12000× G). The upper fat layer was removed and the supernatant was decanted into fresh tubes. This step was repeated twice prior to transferring the supernatant into ultracentrifuge tubes, which were centrifuged at 36000 rpm (105000× G) for 1 h at 5 °C. The resulting supernatant was discarded and the pellet was added to a total of 15 mL of 0.1 M KH2PO4. Pellets were then homogenized gently by hand. Samples were pooled and diluted into a total of 60 mL buffer. The protein concentration of the homogenate was determined by the Lowry method using a BCA (bicinchoninic acid) kit from Pierce Chemical Company. Aliquots (1 mL) of microsomes were subsequently kept frozen in liquid nitrogen. HMG-CoA Reductase Assay Procedure. DMSO (1 µL) or DMSO (1 µL) containing a test compound at a concentration of between 0.1 to 1 nM was placed into each well of a Corning 96 well plate. A volume of 34 µL buffer [100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM imidazole and 10 mM EDTA (ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid)] containing 35 µg/mL rat liver microsomes was added into each well. After incubation for 0.5 h on ice, 15 µL of 14C-HMGCoA (0.024 µCi) with 15 mM NADPH, 25 mM DTT, (dithiothreitol) was added and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 0.75 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 µL of 2 M HCl, followed by the addition of 5 µL of 0.10 M mevalonolactone. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h to allow lactonization of mevalonate to mevalonolactone. The incubated samples were applied to columns containing 300 µL of AGI-X8 anion exchange resin in a Corning filter plate. The eluates were collected into Corning 96 well capture plates. Scintillation cocktail (Ultima-FloM) was added into each well and plates counted on a Trilux Microbeta Counter. The IC50 values were calculated with GraphPad software (Prism). Procedure for Sterol Biosynthesis Assay in Rat Hepatocytes. Frozen rat hepatocyctes purchased from Xeno Tech were seeded on a six-well collagen 1 coated plates at a density of 105 cells/ well. The cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, Gibco, 11054-020) containing 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) and 10 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethyl-piperazie-N1-2ethane sulfonic acid, Gibco 15630-080) for 24 h. The cells were preincubated with compounds for 4 h and then labeled by incubating in medium containing 1 µCi/mL of 14C acetic acid for an additional 4 h. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with 5 nM MOPS (3-[N-morpholino]propane sulfonic acid) solution containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 nM EDTA and collected in the lysis buffer containing 10% KOH and 80% ethanol. To separate labeled cholesterol from labeled noncholesterol lipids, the cells lysates were subject to saponification at 60 °C for 2 h. The lysates were then combined with 0.5 volume of H2O and 2 volumes of hexane, followed by 0.5 h of vigorous shaking. After the separation of two phases, the upper-phase solution was collected and combined with 5 volumes of scintillation cocktail. The amount of 14C cholesterol was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The IC50 values were calculated with GraphPad software (Prism 3.03). Procedure for Sterol Biosynthesis L6 Rat Myoblasts. L6 rat myoblasts purchased from ATCC (CRL-1458) were grown in T-150 vented culture flasks and seeded on 12-well culture plates at a density of 60000 cells per well. The cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% heat inactivated FBS for 72 h until reaching confluence. The cells were preincubated in media with compound and 0.20% DMSO for 3 h and then labeled by incubating in medium containing compound, 0.20% DMSO and 1 µCi/mL of 14C acetic acid for an additional 3 h. After labeling, the cells were washed once with PBS then lysed overnight at 4 °C in buffer containing 10% KOH and 78% ethanol. Lipid ester bonds were hydrolyzed by saponification of the lysates at 60 °C for 2 h. Sterols (including cholesterol) were extracted from saponified lysates by combining with 3 volumes of hexane and mixing by pipet six times. The upper organic phase solution was collected and combined with an equal volume of 1 N KOH in 50% methanol and mixed by pipet six times.

The upper organic phase was collected in a scintilant-coated plate, and hexanes were removed by evaporation at room temperature for 3 h. The amount of 14C cholesterol was quantified by scintillation counting in a Triflux 1450 plate reader (Wallac). The IC50 values were calculated from % inhibitions relative to negative controls versus compound concentration on Microsoft excel 2000 data analysis wizard using a sigmoid inhibition curve model with the following formula: y ) Bmax(1 - (Xn/Kn + Xn)) + Y2, where K is the IC50 for the inhibition curve, X is inhibitor concentration, Y is the response being inhibited, and Bmax + Y2 is the limiting response as X approaches zero. Hamster Acute In Vivo Study Protocol..28 Male Golden Syrian Hamsters were acquired from Charles River for use in these studies. Upon delivery, the hamsters were randomly divided into treatment and control groups of eight animals each and acclimated to a reverse light cycle for 5­11 days. While acclimating to the reverse light cycle, the hamsters were allowed to consume ad libitum normal rodent chow (Research Diets, Purina 5001). Three days prior to the date of the study, the hamsters were transferred to wire-bottom flush caging, and the normal rodent chow was replaced by normal rodent chow with the addition of 2.5% cholestyramine. Hamsters were allowed access to food and water throughout the study period. Each group (n ) 8) of hamsters were dosed with either vehicle or vehicle plus test compound via oral gavage at a volume equivalent to 0.25% body weight. Either 2 (t ) 2­4 h assay) or 4 h (t ) 4­ 6h assay) postdose, each animal was injected (i.p.) with 80 µCi of 14C sodium acetate (Amersham Biosciences, CFQ30013) in 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl. At 4 (t ) 2­4 h assay) or 6 h (t ) 4­6 h assay) postdose, the hamsters were euthanized via CO2, followed by blood collection via cardiac stick. Each sample of blood collected was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 RPM at 5 °C. After separation, 400 µL of plasma were removed from each tube and placed in a 16 × 100 M culture tube for future saponification and extraction of cholesterol esters. To each 400 µL sample of plasma were added 500 µL of saline, 100 µL of 3H cholesterol (internal standard for extraction), and 2.5 mL of 10% KOH. After vortexing, the rack of sample tubes was placed in a water bath preheated to 75 °C for one hour to complete the saponification process. The sample rack was removed from the water bath after one hour and allowed to cool for approximately 15 min. At this point, 2.5 mL of petroleum ether was added to extract the cholesterol esters. The rack was placed on a shaker, and the solutions were mixed for 10 min. The tubes were then centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 RPM and 5 °C to separate the organic and aqueous phases. Using a 2500 µL pipettor and proceeding in groups, 1.2 mL of the organic supernatant was drawn from each culture tube and expressed into a correspondingly numbered 7 mL scintillation vial. Each vial had 5.1 mL of scintillation fluid added to it and was capped for further analysis. Included in the sample analysis were three 7 mL scintillation vials containing 6.3 mL of scintillation fluid serving as blanks, three 7 mL scintillation vials containing 100 µL of 3H cholesterol added to 6.3 mL of scintillation fluid to provide the denominator in the calculation of the percent extraction of the internal standard, and 2 µL of the 80 µCi of 14C sodium acetate/0.9% NaCl solution in 6.3 mL of scintillation fluid to measure consistency of count between aliquots. Seven-Day Guinea Pig LDL-Lowering Assay. Male Hartley guinea pigs (300­500 g initial body weight) were obtained from Charles River, pair housed in guinea pig caging under a 12 h light and dark cycle, and given Guinea Pig Laboratory Diet 5025 and water ad libitum. Animals were allowed to acclimate in house for at least 1 week prior to the study. During the experiment, the animals were fed guinea pig chow (Laboratory diet 5025). Prior to the start of dosing, animals were identified using implantable chips (Bio Medic Data Inc., model IMI-1000). Body weights were obtained at the start of each week to calculate daily doses. Animals were randomly assigned to vehicle (n ) 8) or drug treatment (n ) 8) groups. All compound suspensions were administered (5 mL/ kg) starting on day one and were dosed daily through day 8 via oral gavage. On day 8, animals were dosed and then sacrificed using

CO2 approximately 2 h postdose. Blood was collected in EDTA anticoagulant for analysis of plasma drug levels, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipid profile.
