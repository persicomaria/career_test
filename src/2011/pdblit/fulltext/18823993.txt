Abstract-We used a photoaffinity labeling technique to investigate whether a molecular interaction occurs between antigen and Ia molecules on antigen presenting cells (APC) in the absence of T lymphocytes. M.12.4.1 B lymphoma cells (Iad), which are able to present bovine insulin to Iad lymph node primed T cells, were given radioiodinated bovine insulin derivatized with the photoreactive group (2-nitro-4-azidophenylacetyl) at Lys 29 of the B chain of the insulin molecule. Processing of insulin was allowed by incubating the APC with antigen for increasing periods of time at 37°C or 4°C. The covalent coupling of the processed photoreactive antigen to any neighboring cellular protein was thereafter induced by U.V. irradiation. Immunoprecipitation of membrane proteins by monoclonal antibodies showed that under these conditions, the a and B subunits of the Ia molecules were selectively photolabeled. Labeling was time- and temp-dependent as was the internalization of insulin. The apparent mol. wts of the antigen_Ia molecule complexes were not significantly different from that of native Ia molecules radioiodinated by surface labeling, indicating that only a small fragment of the antigen was covalently coupled to Ia molecules. Similar experiments performed with human B lymphoma cells (526 cells) gave similar results. These observations therefore indicate: (1) that Ia molecules expressed by intact APC are able to bind antigens in the absence of T lymphocyte antigen receptor; and (2) that this association, at least for insulin, requires uptake and a proteolytic fragmentation of the antigen by the APC.

INTRODUCTION Helper T cells recognize protein antigen, in conjunction with Ia determinants of MHC, expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (Shevach and Rosenthal, 1973; Benacerraf, 1978; Schwartz et al., 1978). This presentation requires a processing of the antigen to produce immunogenic peptides (Rosenthal, 1978; Ziegler and Unanue, 1981; Grey

MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Culture media RPM1 1640 and Dulbecco modified Eagle medium were obtained from Gibco (CergyPontoise, France); fetal calf serum from Eurobio (Paris, France); lactoperoxidase (EC. 1.11. I .7.) and bovine insulin from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MD); glucose oxidase (EC.1.3.4.) from Boehringer Mannheim (F.R.G.); dithio bis(succinimidyl propionate), DSP, from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL); pansorbin from Calbiochem Behring (San Diego, CA); complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), containing mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Ra, from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI).

Recently, binding studies using peptides as a model of processed antigen, have suggested that affinity of peptide for class II molecules is important for immunogenicity (Babbitt et al., 1985; Ashwell and Schwartz, 1986; Buus et al., 1986, 1987; Allen et al., 1987). Moreover, photoreactive peptide derivatives have been cross-linked to Ia molecules (Luescher et al., 1988). Phillips et al. (1986), using a photoreactive derivative of insulin, found that this antigen can be cross-linked to Ia molecules without processing. In the present study, using a similar method, we show that insulin, after intracellular processing, *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

The murine M.12.4.1 cell line, a variant of a BALB/c lymphoma prepared by Hamano ef al. (l982), and the human 526 B cell lymphoma were grown in DMEM and RPM1 1640, respectively, containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 pg/ml streptomycin. Immunixtion and T cell proliferation assays

An analog of bovine insulin, with the (2-nitro. 4-azidophenylacetyl) photoreactive group at position Lys 29 of the B chain, was prepared as described elsewhere (Wisher et al., 1980); this photoprobe was radioiodinated by the chloramine T method and purified as described (Freychet et ui., 1976). Photoaj'inity labeling

DBA/2 mice (IFFA Credo, I'Arbresle, France) were immunized with 50 pg bovine insulin emulsified in CFA. Fifty PI of this emulsion were injected into each footpad. Seven days after immunization, cells from popliteal, inguinal and para-aortic lymph nodes were enriched for T cells by passage over nylon wool (Julius et al., 1973) and were cultured at a density of 3 x IO5 cells per (flat bottom) microculture well, together with 5 x IO' irradiated (3000 rads) spleen cells or IO5 irradiated (10,000 rads) M.12.4. I cells, in a final volume of 200~1 of medium per well. We used Click medium (Click et al., 1972) containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 pg/ml streptomycin, 25 pg/ml gentamicin, 5 x IO- 5 M 2-mercaptoethanol and 5% heat inactivated fetal serum. Bovine insulin was added to a final concn of 100 pg/ml. After 3 days of incubation at 37-C under 5"/0 CO,, 95% air. in a humidified incubator, I PCi (37 kBq) of `Hthymidine (CEA, Saclay, France) was added to the cultures. Cells were harvested onto glassfiber filters 16 hr later using an automatic harvester (Titertek Flow Laboratories, Puteaux, France) and incorporated `H-thymidine from triplicate cultures was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Ceil surf&e labeling and chemical cross -linking

Cells were harvested from culture, washed twice in PBS (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, IO mM glucose) and resuspended to 10 x IO' cells per ml in PBS containing radiolabeled photoprobe (0.3 mM; 4.8 MBq/ pg) and incubated for specified times at 37'C in the dark. Photoactivation was induced by exposing the samples to U.V. light given by a high pressure mercury lamp (Philips HPK 125 W/L) for IOmin. Cells were washed twice in PBS and solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Immunoprecipitation and separation of the precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE were performed as described above. Internalization of' insulin

Cells, suspended at 10' cells/`ml in culture medium containing 0.1% BSA and 20 mA4 Hepes. pH 7.4 (CBH), were incubated in the presence of IO ' ,%I unlabeled insulin and 10 /LCi (370 kBq) "`I-insulin for specified times at either 37 C or O'C. Aliquots of the cell suspension were then diluted out into 40 volumes of ice cold acid buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 50mM glycine and 0.3% BSA. pH 2.0. After 2min on ice the cells were centrifuged through a mixture of dinonylphtalateedibutylphtalate (I : 2, v:v) and the radioactivity of the pellets was counted.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Cell surface labeling was performed as previously described (Samson et al., 1986) with minor modifications: 5 x IO' cells were incubated for 30 min at room temp with 2mCi (74 MBq) of Na'251, 15 U/ml lactoperoxidase, 80 U/ml glucose oxidase and 160mM glucose. Proteins were cross-linked by the bifunctional reagent, DSP, as previously described (Samson et al., 1986). Immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis

Solubilization, immunoprecipitation and SDSPAGE were performed as previously described (Samson et al., 1986) with minor modifications: cells were solubilized in buffer containing 150 mA4 NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40. 0.02% NaN,, 1 mM Tris, pH 7.4, IO4 U Trasylol, 1 mg/ml Bacitracin. Cell extracts were incubated overnight with pansorbin. Precleared samples were then incubated with mAb for 2 hr at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were solubilized in SDS buffer and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, according to Laemmli (1970), using a 7.5-17.5% linear

The murine B lymphoma cell line M. 12.4.1. as well as somatic cell hybrids between them and normal B cells, have been shown to be able to present antigen to T cells (Glimcher et ul., 1982; Baumhiiter t'r N/.. 1985; Bekkhoucha et al., 1984). We have thcrcforc tested whether M.12.4.1 cells could also present bovine insulin to primed T cells. Lymph node primed T cells were cultured in the absence or presence of irradiated syngeneic spleen cells of M. 12.4.1 B cells as feeder, with or without beef insulin. After 3 days the cultures were pulsed with `H-thymidine. The results shown in Fig. I clearly indicate that M. 12.4.1 cells. as well as syngeneic splenocytes, were able to reconstitute in vitro the insulin induced T cell proliferative response. Moreover native and derivatized insulins have been shown to behave in the same way in terms of binding (Berhanu et ul., 1982; Fehlmann ef (I/.. 1982). The presence of Ia molecules at the surface of' M.12.4.1 cells was then analyzed, after labeling the

Figure 2 shows that anti-Ia mAb precipitated three labeled components at mol. wts of 30,000, 37,000 and 47.000 (lane B). These proteins were not precipitated by anti-class I mAb (lane A), indicating that the photoprobe was specifically associated with la molecules. The molecular masses of the labeled components arc similar to those observed after surface iodination and precipitation by the same anti-Ia mAb (lanes F and F-i), indicating that only a small fragmem of the photoprobe was coupled to Ia molecules. This suggests that the antigen was processed before interacting with the MHC glycoprotein. This view is also supported by the observation that the labeling could be detected after 30min of incubation of the cclis with the photoprobe. but increased over the next 3 hr. In addition. when incubation was performed at 4 C, the components precipitated by anti-Ia mAb wcrc very weakly labeled, suggesting that endocytosis 01 antigen was required to allow its processing. Endocytosis of insulin was quantified by following associated with the acid resistance of "`I-insulin M. 12.4.1 cells at 37` C. In this protocol, "ii-insulin molecules that have been internalized remain cellassociated when cells are briefly incubated at pH 3.0. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that internalization of "`I-insulin increased with time over 3 hr. By contrast, at 0 C no internalization occurred. This uptake was not receptor mediated, since the concn of iodinated insulin was 1000 times lower than that of unlabeled insulin, a condition under which there is no specific binding to the insulin receptor.

Figure 2 shows that anti-la mAb (lane F) precipitated a heavily labeled component at a mol. wt of 31,000, corresponding to the /i chain of the Ia antigens. No labeled material was precipitated by an equivalent amount of non-relevant mAb (lane E). To test whether the r chain of la molecules is normally expressed at the surface of M.12.4.1 cells, labeled cells were incubated in the presence of homobifunctionai reagent DSP. In these conditions, intimately associated proteins in which free amino groups are 12 A apart can be covalently bound together: when DSP treatment was introduced before soi~Ibilization and immunoprccipitation, the component at mol. wt 31,000 disappeared, whereas a component at mol. wt 67,000. corresponding to the heterodimer r/L appeared (lane H). These results indicate that both the c( and p chains are present in an eyuimolecular amount, but that the r chain is poorly labeled by the lactoperoxidase method. H-2" mouse strains have been shown to respond to bovine and porcine insulins by recognizing the B chain in the context of I-Ad (Rosenwasser et al.. i979; Shapiro et ul., 1984). Therefore we used a bovine insulin photoprobe, derived on the B chain at lysine B 29, to investigate a possible molecular interaction between the insulin E? chain and the MHC class II molecules during the process of antigen presentation. M 12.4.1 cells were incubated in the dark with a `?"I-photoreactive analog at 37'C for 90 min, to allow antigen processing.

Labeling of Ia molecules, as in our experiments, was time- and temp-dependent; however, from the difference between the molecular masses of the labeled components before and after cleavage of the photoprobe, they concluded that insulin bound to class II MHC molecules was intact. The discrepancy between their and our results could be due to the different cell types used and/or to the difference in hydrophobicity of the derivatizing group. We next performed the same experiment with human B cells from a B lymphoma (line 526). HLA-DR determinants at the surface of 526 cells were first analyzed after protein labeling by the lactoperoxidase method. Anti-HLA-DR mAb precipitated two major components at mol. wts of 31,000 and 37,000 (Fig. 4, lane H), corresponding to the /I and t( chains of HLA-DR molecules, respectively. Two minor bands were also seen at 44,000 and 67,000. The 44,000 mol. wt protein corresponds to the HLA class I heavy chain, as discussed elsewhere (Samson et al., 1986) whereas the 66,000 component could be an a/l heterodimer of HLA class II molecules. No labeled material was precipitated by an equivalent amount of non-relevant mAb (lane G). To investigate a possible molecular association of insulin photoprobe and HLA-DR molecules, the procedure used for M.12.4.1 cells was also used for human B cells. The results are presented in Fig. 4.

of 31,000, 37,000 and 66,000 (laneB). No labeled material was precipitated with anti-F&A class I mAb (lane D) or anti-transferrin receptor mAb (lane F) indicating that insulin interacts specifically with HLA-DR molecules. The mol. wts of the components in lane B corresponded to those observed (after surface labeling and immunoprecipitation) by anti-HLA-DR mAb (lane H) suggesting, as we observed for murine Ia molecules. that only a smaft fragment of insulin was coupled to HLA-DR g~ycoprote~ns. fn this experiment also, when incubation of cells in the presence of "S1-photoprobe was performed at 4"C, anti-HLADR mAb precipitated very little labeled material at mol. wts of 31,000, 37,000 and 66,000 (lane A), suggesting again that endocytosis of antigen was necessary to allow antigen processing. We have previously shown that insulin is not internalized by the receptor mediated process in 526 cells (Samson et al., 1986). However, as shown in Fig. 5. insulin was endocytosed by a non-specific process at 37°C. In addition, uptake of insulin by 526 celis was not affected in the presence of anti-HLA-DR mAb. In conclusion, cl&s II MHC glycoproteins on intact APC bind fragments of processed insulin as antigen. The T cell receptor is not required to observe this molecular association, but could stabilize the complex, as shown by energy transfer (Watts et nl., 1986). Further studies will be necessary to identify the fragment(s) which binds to class IT antigen.
