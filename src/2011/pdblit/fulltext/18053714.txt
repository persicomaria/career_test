Abstract--Structure and property based drug design was exploited in the synthesis of sulfonamidopyrrolidin-2-one-based factor Xa (fXa) inhibitors, incorporating biaryl P4 groups, producing highly potent inhibitors with encouraging oral pharmacokinetic profiles and significant but sub-optimal anticoagulant activities. ” 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The quest for anticoagulant therapies with improved efficacy/safety profiles has included considerable efforts to discover small molecule inhibitors of factor Xa (fXa),1 which plays a pivotal role in the coagulation cascade. Clinical data are emerging to support this approach,2 although the pursuit of molecules suitable for chronic oral administration has presented significant medicinal chemistry challenges, including identifying compounds with both acceptable pharmacokinetic profiles and good anticoagulant activities. Classes of molecules that meet these challenges are beginning to emerge, including neutral or weakly basic molecules as represented by our sulfonamidopyrrolidin-2-one-based inhibitors 1,3 which include examples displaying attractive anticoagulant properties as well as good oral exposure. Effective utilisation of X-ray structural information led to a series of highly potent acyclic analogues 2,4 and as part of a programme of work to build on these latter findings, we sought to exploit structural information to increase intrinsic fXa

A FLO docking study5 using our available structural information provided a strong impetus to expand our synthetic programme to include biaryl motifs as P4 ligands.6 This identified the opportunity to secure good hydrophobic contacts between the distal ring and the aromatic residues in the S4 pocket.

The target molecules were accessed as outlined in Scheme 1, utilising the reaction of the appropriate anilines, activated as trimethylaluminium complexes, with N-Boc homoserine lactone as the key step.7 The resulting homoserine amide was converted into the required N-Boc aminopyrrolidin-2-one 4 using Mitsunobu conditions.8 In this manner, the monoaryl bromide intermediate 4 was accessed from 4-bromo-2-fluoroaniline. Subsequent cross couplings of 4 with aryl boronic acids9 or heterocycles gave the requisite biaryl intermediates 5 (Y = CF); however the C-3 stereocentre was racemised under these conditions.10 The final compounds 6 were accessed by removal of the Boc protection, followed by sulfonylation under standard conditions. Alternatively, the target compounds 6 were generated as racemates by conversion of 4 into the corresponding sulfonamides 7 followed by cross-coupling with aryl boronic acids.10 The pyridines 6 (Y = N) were accessed using a variation on this route starting from 2-amino-

5-iodopyridine via the aryl iodide 8, which was converted into the pinacol boronate ester 9. This was cross coupled with the requisite aryl bromides,9 to yield the biaryl intermediates 5 (Y = N) en route to the target compounds 6 (Y = N). An initial set of compounds explored a variety of distal aromatic rings attached to the 4-position of a 2-fluoro aniline.11 Gratifyingly, potent inhibition of fXa12 was achieved with a number of these biaryl motifs, which gave insight into the optimal requirements for activity, with subtle changes producing significant shifts in activity (Table 1). Incorporation of an ortho substituent on the distal ring was generally associated with increased potency, with the 2-methylsulfonyl analogue 10 being particularly noteworthy. In addition, various heterocyclic distal rings were tolerated. Interestingly, retaining a terminal phenyl ring and incorporating a proximal 2pyridyl ring was well tolerated (cf. 19 and 20). However,

in spite of the very high fXa potency of some of these compounds, very poor anticoagulant activity was achieved, as assessed in the PT assay.13 To try to address this very poor conversion of excellent potency into plasma-based activity, the effect of modulating the overall hydrophobicity of the molecule through changes to the P1 ligand was investigated--an approach used with success in our previously reported 1-methyl-2-morpholin-4-yl-2-oxoethyl series 1.3b Thus, retaining the highly potent 2 0 -methylsulfonyl biaryl P4 group, a series of P1 sulfonamides was generated (Table 2). Mirroring SAR established for the 1-methyl2-morpholin-4-yl-2-oxoethyl series 1, molecules with reduced hydrophobicity were identified (e.g. 21) that showed better anticoagulant activity, even though they had marginally lesser intrinsic potency. The activity of 20 (Table 1), the 2-pyridyl analogue, offered a further opportunity to investigate the potential benefits of reducing hydrophobicity, based on clog D values.14a Thus, SAR were investigated in compounds incorporating this 2-pyridyl proximal ring, whilst retaining the preferred (5-chlorothien-2-yl)ethenyl P1 group (Table 2) and making systematic changes to the ortho substituent on the distal phenyl ring in the P4 group (Table 3). A wide range of intrinsic activities was obTable 2. fXa inhibitory activities12 anticoagulant potency13 and hydrophobicity calculations14a for compounds 10, 21≠26 and human serum albumin binding data14c for compounds 10, 21, 25

served. However, the expected benefit of the reduced hydrophobicity was not apparent in the measured values (CHI log D values14b for 21 and 29 were 3.07 and 3.04, respectively) contributing to the poorer translation of high intrinsic potency into plasma-based activity. This is evident in other fXa series incorporating biaryl S4 ligands and has been attributed to protein binding3b,6b and/or substrate-dependent inhibition mechanisms.6b,15 As part of the concerted process of using both property and structure based design, a crystal structure of 21 bound into fXa (Fig. 1) revealed very clear density for the compound in initial difference electron density maps.16 This structure confirmed the binding mode predicted by modelling studies, including the anticipated preference for the 3-S stereochemistry of the lactam ring substituent. The (5-chlorothien-2-yl)ethenyl group sits in the S1 pocket, the central pyrrolidinone makes a water mediated interaction with the main chain carbonyl of Ser214 and the biaryl group sits with the rings orthogonal to each other in the P4 pocket. The methylsulfonyl group sits above the S4 pocket and does not make any direct interactions with the protein. This P4 group is significantly longer than those for which structures have previously been determined3,4 and this additional length is accommodated by rearrangement of the water structure bridging Tyr99 and Phe174. This X-ray structure substantiated the modelled binding mode and supported the idea that locking the two rings into a preferred orthogonal conformation would confer good levels of activity. However, this could not explain the range of potencies observed with various ortho substituents of comparable bulk on the distal ring (Table 3). The proximity of the opposite ortho hydrogen of the distal ring to the indole fragment of Trp215 suggested that the partial charge on this hydrogen may be significant. An electrostatic potential map of the indole ring indicated a significantly enriched area of electron density

In summary, the synthesis, activities and structure property relationships have been explored within a rationally designed series of sulfonamidopyrrolidin-2-one-based fXa inhibitors incorporating non-basic biaryl P4 motifs. This work has identified several highly potent examples with encouraging oral pharmacokinetic profiles and significant but sub-optimal anticoagulant activities. X-ray structural data confirmed the binding mode anticipated from modelling studies and quantitative analysis suggested a plausible explanation of the nature of the distal ring interaction. These findings, taken together with our increased in-house knowledge, gave clear indications for our ongoing programme of work; this is developed in a second generation series, described in the accompanying paper.

This hypothesis was substantiated by a plot of the Hammett rm constant17 versus fXa pKi, in which a clear trend was observed towards increased potency with increased electron withdrawing power (Fig. 2). The trend line for this analysis showed for this series that pKi = 5.28 ∑ rm + 6.39, with an R2 value of 0.897. Pharmacokinetic studies with selected compounds were carried out in rats18 (Table 4) and demonstrated that encouraging profiles with significant oral exposure were achievable in this series.

The stereochemistry of the 3-amino linkage we believe was most probably racemised under the strongly basic crosscoupling conditions. However, the preferred (3S)-enantiomer, anticipated from docking studies, was clearly evident in the structures bound within fXa when cocrystallised from the racemates.

ray structures determined with various fXa bound inhibitors of this type in our work often falls within this distance range and could be consistent with such a fluorophilic interaction, although the occupancy of this particular ring orientation appeared to be not quite complete.16. Factor Xa inhibitory activities were largely determined using Rhodamine 110, bis-(CBZ-glycylglycyl)-L -arginine amide as fluorogenic substrate, with the others using N-aZ-D -Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide as chromogenic substrate; details are described in Ref. 3b.

As part of a broader investigation, a number of examples from this and other related fXa series were subjected to an in depth analysis of their protein binding and fXa kinetics, using the Biacore“ surface plasmon resonance technique. These experiments indicated that biaryl-based molecules, in comparison to other structural classes we have investigated,3,4 were generally more tightly bound to specific human serum albumin sites and had reduced fXa on-rates, consistent with their relatively poorer translation of intrinsic potency into plasma-based activity.
