Introduction. The structure of the CutA protein from Thermotoga maritima (tmCutA) was determined at 1.4 Å resolution using the Se-Met multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) technique. This protein (TIGR annotation - TM1056, DNA bases 1,069,580 ­1,069,885) is conserved in numerous bacteria, archaea and eucarya, including plants and mammals (COG1324, Fig. 1). The CutA Escherichia coli homolog--CutA1 (35% ID) is involved in divalent cation homeostasis,1 while the mammalian homolog--mCutA (40% ID) was found to be associated with cell surface acetylcholinesterase.2 However, the biological function of the CutA proteins is yet to be determined. The tmCutA monomer assumes a two-layer / / sandwich fold ( 1 2 1 3 4 3 5 6 5) shared by a large number of proteins (CATH number 3.30.70.120). Two short ( 2 5 and two long ( 3 4) -strands arranged in an antiparallel fashion 51 22 31 42 form a curved sheet. Three -helices cover one side of the molecule (Fig. 2a). Each monomer is elongated with overall dimensions approximately 25 30 60 Å (Fig. 2a). The monomers are assembled into a trimer with dimensions 55 55 35 Å through interaction of the edges of three -strands ( 3 n the top and 5 6 on the bottom) (Fig. 2b). In the trimer, the subunits are related by crystallographic three fold axes. The same oligomeric state was observed for tmCutA in solution by size exclusion experiments (see Methods) and appears to be functionally relevant. In the trimer, there is a cavity that is accessible from outside via three solvent accessible channels. The inner surface of the cavity is lined with several conserved residues including Cys35, which may serve as a potential metal binding site. Structural homologues of tmCutA were identified using Dali search3 and SSAP structure comparison program 4. The closest structural matches, with a Dali score of 9.4 Z, were the E. coli signal transducer proteins GlnB (PII)5 and GlnK6 (Fig. 2c). These two proteins are 67% identical to each other but have insignificant sequence similarity (less than 15% ID) to tmCutA. GlnB and GlnK, which are also trimeric, are involved in maintaining nitrogen homeostasis7­9 and have been shown to cooperatively bind ATP and

-ketoglutarate.6,10 The ATP binding sites of GlnB and GlnK are located in clefts between the momoners,11 but most of the conserved amino acids that mediate ATP binding in PII proteins are not found in tmCutA. The cavity on the side of tmCutA is formed by a number of conserved aromatic (Tyr45, Trp47, Tyr81, and Trp101) and charged residues (Asp54, Glu56, Glu82) (Figs. 1 and 2c), which makes this cleft a strong candidate for a conserved function. In PII-type proteins, the two central -strains 3 and 4 are joined by a flexible loop called the T-loop, which is composed of 17 amino acids. The T-loop plays a key role in protein-protein interactions with downstream effector proteins.12 The 3 and 4 strands in tmCutA, while longer than the corresponding strands in the PII proteins (12 residues in the 3 strand of tmCutA compared with 9 in the 2 strand of PII proteins), are joined by only a two-amino acid (Lys48Gly49) turn and form a hairpin.

Multiple sequence alignment of CutA from Thermotoga maritima (Thema) against other periplasmic divalent cation tolerance proteins from bacteria (Aquae Aquifex aeolicus, Deira Deinococcus radiodurans) and archaea (Pyrho Pyrococcus horikoshii, Arcfu Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Thevo Thermoplasma volcanium), together with one from Mouse and a brain acetylcholinesterase putative membrane anchor from Human. Sequence conservation is color coded from red for invariant residues to orange to grey to none. The secondary structure of the T. maritima CutA is schematically shown in purple above the alignment.

Although the residues in the C-terminal extension of 3-strand in tmCutA proteins (Tyr45, Trp46, and Trp47, Fig. 1) are conserved among tmCutA homologs, the structure of this region in tmCutA is different than in PII proteins and thus this region of tmCutA may not participate in protein-protein interactions. CutA is annotated as being involved in metal homeostasis. Several other structural homologs of tmCutA, includ-

ing the PII proteins, metallochaperone Atx1 (5.9 Z score) and the metal-binding domain of the Menkes coppertransporting ATPase (4.5 Z score) have metal-binding properties.13,14 These proteins coordinate the metal through a CXXC sequence motif,15,16 but this motif is not found in CutA. Therefore, tmCutA may represent a new branch of this family that differs from PII and metal binding proteins. The biochemical experiments are under

way to define possible ligands and functional partners of CutA proteins. Methods. The tmCutA gene was subcloned, expressed and its product purified and screened for crystallization as described previously.17 Crystals for X-ray diffraction data collection were obtained from hanging drop vapor diffusion conditions containing 2 l of Se-Met derivative of the protein plus 2 l of 2 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M Tris HCl at pH 8.5 and 2% glycerol, over 2­5 days at 21°C. The crystals were flash frozen with crystallization buffer completed with 25% glycerol. Diffraction data (Table I) were collected at beamline 19ID of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory following the approach described earlier.18 The three-wavelength inversed beam MAD data up to 1.4 Å were collected from one Se-Met labeled protein crystal at 100 K with 3 seconds exposure/1°/frame using a 100 mm crystal-to-detector distance. The total oscillation range

was 90°, as predicted using strategy module within HKL2000 suite.19 All data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (Table I). The structure was determined by MAD phasing using CNS.20 The initial model was built automatically using wARP,21 and refined to 1.4 Å using CNS against the peak data. The final R factor was 0.218, and the free R was 0.241 (Table II). Final refinement permitted us to define the coordinates of all 101 amino acids of tmCutA, seven (ALYFMGH) N-terminal amino acids belonging to His6-tag and two (GS) C-terminal amino acids, which resulted from the cloning artifact. HPLC size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex-75 and Superdex-200 columns (10 300 mm) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl. The column was calibrated with cytochrome C (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), -amylase (200 kDa), and Blue Dextran (2,000 kDa). A 25- l of tmCutA protein sample at a 2 mg ml 1 concentration or premixed with standard proteins was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min before being injected into the column through a 20 L injection loop. Filtration was carried out at 20°C at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1. The eluted proteins were detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm.
