The stator ring of the bacterial flagellar motor is composed of the MotA and MotB proteins that act together to generate a turning force (torque) acting on the FliG ring of the rotor. The C-terminal domain of MotB (MotB-C) is believed to anchor the MotA/MotB complex to peptidoglycan (PG) of the cell wall. The first crystal structures of MotB-C and its complex with N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) have been determined to 1.6- and 2.3-Å resolution, respectively. MotB-C is a dimer, both in solution and in the crystal. The two glycan chains of the PG ligand can be modeled as semirigid helices and docked into the grooves harboring the NAM molecules on the opposite faces of the dimer. The model suggests that a concave hydrophilic surface created upon edge-to-edge -sheet dimerization and centered around the 2-fold axis of the dimer can accommodate the peptide cross-bridge linking the two sugar chains. Significant structural similarities were found between MotB-C and the PG-binding domains of reduction-modifiable protein M and peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein exclude, suggesting that PG recognition by different outer membrane protein A-like proteins may be governed by very similar molecular mechanisms that evidently involve protein dimerization.

he bacterial flagellar motor is nature's rotary nanomachine that turns helical filaments, creating a propulsive force for bacteria to swim (1). The stator of this motor is formed by the membrane proteins MotA and MotB, which associate in complexes MotA4MotB2 (2) circumferentially arranged around the rotor (3). These complexes use the gradient of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane to generate the turning force (torque) applied to the FliG component of the rotor (4, 5). Previous biochemical and mutagenesis experiments provided evidence that the stator function involves protonation/deprotonation of a conserved aspartate residue in the transmembrane helix of MotB that is associated with a conformational change within the complex (6, 7). However, the detailed molecular mechanism by which the stator couples the ion flow to flagellar rotation is not yet understood, mainly owing to the lack of structural information for the stator and rotor-stator interface. The MotB subunit has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a hydrophobic -helix spanning the cytoplasmic membrane, and a C-terminal periplasmic domain (8, 9). The C-terminal domain contains a motif LSX2RAX2VX3L, conserved throughout the family of outer membrane protein A (OmpA)-like peptidoglycan (PG)-binding domains (10). It is therefore thought that the periplasmic domain of MotB binds to the highly cross-linked stress-bearing zone of the PG of the cell wall, thus immobilizing the stator ring of the bacterial flagellar motor. The functional importance of this domain has been highlighted by previous mutagenesis studies that mapped most of the mutations in the motB gene associated with a loss of motility in Escherichia coli to 160 C-terminal residues (11). The Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium Helicobacter pylori associated with gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer, and gastric cancer (12, 13) possesses a single motB gene (14). Flagellar

motility has been proven to be required during the initial colonization of the stomach (15, 16) and for attaining full infection levels in an animal model (17). In-frame deletion of the motB gene in H. pylori created flagellated nonmotile mutants with reduced ability to infect mice (17). H. pylori has mesodiaminopimelate (mDAP)-type PG with N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)­N-acetylmuramic acid (NA M)- L -Ala- D -Glu-( )mDAP-D-Ala-D-Ala/Gly as the basic unit (Fig. 1 and ref. 18). NAG and NAM are connected in an alternating fashion by -(1,4)-glycosidic bonds forming the glycan chains. Pentapeptide stems attached to NAM residues are cross-linked by transpeptidases in a tail-to-tail fashion, bridging the glycan chains to form a regular structure of the cell wall matrix. As a step toward elucidating the molecular basis for PG recognition by H. pylori MotB and investigating the possible role that its separate domains play in the oligomeric behavior and assembly of a single stator unit, the putative PG-binding domain of MotB (MotB-C) comprising the 132 C-terminal residues was expressed in E. coli, purified, and crystallized as described (19). This article reports determination of the crystal structures of MotB-C and its complex with NAM.

134­149), 2 (residues 175­194), and 4 (residues 235­250) pack against one face of the -sheet, whereas the shorter helix 3 (residues 217­225) forms an N-terminal extension of strand 4. The loops connecting -strands with -helices at one end of the -sheet (near the C termini of 2 and 3 and the N terminus of 4) are short and relatively rigid. The opposite end of the -sheet expands into three longer petal-like loops, 1 1, 2 2, and 3 4. Analysis of the distribution of the main-chain temperature factor and average C rmsd for pairwise superpositions of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit [supporting information (SI) Fig. S1] identifies these loops as the most mobile elements in the structure. In a comparison of the atomic coordinates of MotB-C against the structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (21) using the DALI Server (22), significant similarities were found with PG-associated lipoproteins (PALs) from E. coli (PDB ID code 1OAP), Haemophilus influenzae (23), and Neisseria meningitides reduction-modifiable protein M (RmpM) (24) (Fig. 2B). MotB-C and the PG-binding domains of PALs and RmpM adopt a very similar fold, despite the limited sequence homology ( 8%

global sequence identity and 18% identity for pairwise comparisons of MotB-C with PALs and RmpM; see Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2 B and D, the four proteins share a strongly conserved 100-residue structural core comprising a fourstranded -sheet and three -helices that pack against it in an almost identical manner. The structures of PALs from E. coli and H. influenzae and RmpM from N. meningitides can be superimposed on MotB-C over the 100 C atoms of the common core with an rmsd of 1.5, 2.1, and 1.9 Å, respectively. The sequence alignment of MotB-C, PALs, and RmpM identifies only 10 conserved residues (Fig. 2C). When their positions are highlighted on the structure of MotB-C (Fig. 2D), there is a clear prevalence of such residues in the core of the protein, except for the structurally important Gly-195 in loop 3 3.

search model. Of 16 subunits in the asymmetric unit of the cocrystal with NAM, the electron density corresponding to the sugar molecule (Fig. 3A) was found in the two subunits with the lowest temperature factor. NAM binds in the middle of a shallow 25-Å-long groove formed by loops 2 2 and 3 3 at one end of the -sheet (Fig. 3). Van der Waals contacts with the protein involve the peptide backbone of Ser-175, His-176, Tyr-177 and Gly-207 and sidechain atoms Asp-165(C ), Ser-175(C ), His-176(N 1), His176(C ), Tyr-177(C 1), and Tyr-177(C 1). The complex is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between Tyr-177(N) and the carboxyl oxygen of NAM, Ser-208(O ) and NAM(O1), Ser-208(N) and the acetamido oxygen of NAM, and a watermediated hydrogen bond between NAM(O6) and Leu-168(N). Fifty-eight percent of the accessible surface area (asa) of the sugar is buried upon this interaction. Superposition of the structures of free and NAM-bound MotB-C gave an rmsd of 0.25 Å for 132 C atoms, indicating that the overall protein structure does not undergo any significant conformational changes upon complex formation. Blair et al. (11) reported substitutions in E. coli MotB that result in complete or partial loss of bacterial motility (11). Most of the structurally equivalent residues in H. pylori MotB-C have their side chains buried within the protein fold (Figs. 2C and 3B). Only substitutions Glu-205­Lys, Ala-242­Thr, and Ala-242­Val appear to involve surface-exposed side chains. The corresponding residues in H. pylori MotB-C, Arg-172 and Thr-209, reside on loops 2 2 and 3 3, respectively, flanking the opposite ends of the groove that accommodates NAM in the MotB-C/NAM crystal structure (Fig. 3 B and C). This finding strongly suggests that this groove forms part of the PG-binding surface in MotB.

MotB-C eluted as a single symmetrical peak with a polydispersity index value close to 1 in all four buffers, indicating that the eluted particles were homogenous with respect to the molar mass. The weight average molecular weight values ranged between 33.8 and 34.8 kDa, which is approximately twice the molecular mass calculated from the amino acid sequence (15.9 kDa).

dimeric proteins (28). Calculation of the Stokes radius from the crystal structure of the MotB-C dimer gives the value of 2.7 nm, which is very close to the value derived from the MALLS analysis in solution (2.5 nm in all tested conditions). These results demonstrate that H. pylori MotB-C exists as a dimer in solution, in line with the previous reports of the dimeric behavior for the periplasmic domain of Salmonella MotB (29) and other OmpAlike PG-binding domains, such as that of N. meningitidis RmpM (24) and E. coli PAL (30). The MotB-C dimer is 70 Å long at its maximum dimension and thus can insert into the pores of the PG matrix, the smallest diameter of which is estimated to be 70 Å (31).
Model for PG Binding by a MotB-C Dimer. The C1­O1 and C4­O4

bonds of NAM bound in the middle of the long groove point to its opposite ends, marked by the positions of Arg-172 and Thr-209 (Fig. 3 B and C). This geometry suggests an obvious direction of the binding of the (NAM-NAG)n chain of the natural PG ligand. Previous NMR studies of the cell wall fragment in solution revealed that the glycan chain forms a relatively rigid right-handed helix with a periodicity of three for the NAG­NAM repeat (31). The model for a nine-residue segment of the glycan chain was constructed by consecutive addition of sugar rings adhering to the experimentally determined average values for glycosidic torsion angles (31). The glycan fragment was then manually docked into the groove on the MotB-C surface by overlapping one of its NAM residues with the crystallographically observed NAM followed by minor readjustments of the torsion angles, to remove steric clashes with the protein atoms, and several cycles of structure idealization as implemented in REFMAC (27). Analysis of this model (Fig. 4A) suggests that the groove formed by loops Asp-165­Tyr-177 and Ser-208­Asp-216 may interact with as many as seven consecutive residues of the glycan chain, buring a total of 540 Å2 of the protein surface at the interface. Calculations of the surface area of the sugar rings shielded from the solvent upon this interaction give the values of 27%, 12%, 39%, 58%, 25%, 37% and 40% for the rings 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively (numbering from the nonreducing to the reducing end with 0 corresponding to the NAM position observed in the crystal), suggesting good surface complementaritiy between the protein and the ligand in the model. Only two of the six hydrogen bonds between the protein and the glycan involve protein side chains (Asp-165 and Ser-208); the rest are formed with main-chain atoms Leu-168(O), Lys174(O), His-176(N), and Asn-215(N). Van der Waals contacts with protein involve the main-chain peptides in segments Asp165­Tyr-177 and Ser-208­Asp-216 and the protein side-chain atoms Pro-167(C ), Lys-174(C , C ), Ser-175(C ), His176(N 1), His-176(C ), Tyr-177(C 1), Tyr-177(C 1), Tyr177(OH), Pro-211(C ), and Pro-214(C ). The peptide stem attached to the ( 2) NAM residue of the modeled PG fragment would bind between loop 2 2 and helix 3, possibly forming hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg-221 and Asp-165 (Fig. 4B). Arg-221 is strongly conserved in MotBs (Fig. S2) whereas Asp-165 can be conservatively substituted by Asn. A topologically similar binding site for the peptide moiety of PG had been previously identified in the region formed by loops 1 1, 2 2, and helix 3 of H. influenzae PAL (23). The two symmetry-related glycan-chain binding sites of the MotB-C dimer are located on opposite faces, separated by 50 Å (Figs. 3D and 5), which implies that MotB can bind to PG in the mode that engages two glycan strands simultaneously. The peptide stem attached to residue (0) NAM of the bound natural PG ligand would extend over and approximately parallel to strand 3, toward the 2-fold axis of the MotB-C dimer (Figs. 4B and 5). Modeling suggests that the tails of the two peptide stems extending from
10352 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0803039105

NAM (0) of the two glycan chains bound at opposite ends of the dimer can be close enough to form a cross-link. Thus, the hydrophilic concave surface formed by strands 2 and 3, and centered around the 2-fold axis of the dimer, may provide a binding site for the peptide cross-bridge, with the pseudo 2-fold symmetry of the latter matching the symmetry of the dimer (Figs. 3D and 5). The fact that the surface distance between the NAM carboxyl groups at the opposite ends of the dimer (43 Å) is very close to the calculated length for the peptide bridge in the extended conformation (43.6 Å; ref. 32) supports this view. The structure therefore suggests that MotB-C may form extensive interactions with both the glycan and the peptide moieties of PG with a total of 2,400 Å2 of the protein asa shielded upon binding to PG. The presented structural analysis provides a useful foundation for more systematic biochemical and genetic studies.
Implications for PG Binding by Other OmpA-Like Domains. The MotB-C regions proposed to interact with PG in this study show the least main-chain deviation in the superposition of the structures of MotB-C and the PG-binding domains of PALs and RmpM (as highlighted by the blue color in Fig. 5; also see Fig. 2D). The solvent-exposed part of the -sheet, the shallow groove formed by loops 2 2 and 3 3, and the adjoining surface pocket between loop 2 2 and helix 3 are topologically and spatially preserved in the compared structures. This finding suggests that PG recognition by different OmpA-like proteins may be governed by very similar molecular mechanisms that evidently involve protein dimerization. However, the lack of conservation of surface residues in these proteins begs a question: how is high affinity to PG preserved without any apparent strict evolutionary constraints on the nature of the side chains at the protein­PG interface? Analysis of the model for the glycan chain binding to MotB-C (Fig. 4A) reveals that most of the hydrogen bonds and a large proportion of the van der Waals contacts with the glycan are made by the protein main-chain atoms. Further examination shows that, of the eight side chains found in the walls of the sugar-chain binding groove, six (Asp165, Pro-167, Lys-174, Ser-175, Tyr-177, and Pro-214) are positioned tangentially to the glycan chain. Therefore, variation of the side-chain length at these locations would not introduce steric clashes with the ligand or alter the width of the glycanchain binding groove, consistent with significant sequence variability at these positions in OmpA-like domains (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2). The MotB-C side chains that point radially toward the glycan chain in the model are His-176, Pro-211, and Ser-208. His-176 is conservatively substituted by Asn in other OmpA-like proteins. Pro-211 is conserved in MotBs and is conservatively substituted by Ala in some of OmpA-like PG-binding domains. Ser-208 (predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the glycan chain) is substituted by a polar residue (Asp, Glu, Lys) in many homologous proteins. These structural features provide an explanation for the great sequence variability of the surface residues in OmpA-like proteins that fine-tuned themselves to recognize species-specific PG (33).

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and Data Collection. Native and ytterbium derivative crystals of MotB-C from H. pylori strain 26695 were obtained as described (19). The MotB-C/NAM crystal complex was produced by cocrystallization with 10 mM NAM under similar conditions. X-ray diffraction data for the native cryocooled crystal and the NAM complex were collected to 1.6- and 2.3-Å resolution, respectively, using the Swiss Light Source (PX06). A MAD experiment was performed on a single crystal of Yb derivative at 100 K on European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline BM16. All of the data were processed and scaled by using programs MOSFLM (34) and SCALA (27) (see Table S1). Structure Determination. The locations of the two Yb sites for the derivative were found by using ShelxD (35). Refinement of heavy-atom parameters and calculation of phases were carried out with MLPHARE (27). An improved map

was obtained by combined solvent flattening, histogram matching, and fourfold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, as implemented in DM (36). The first model was built manually into a 3.0-Å resolution electron density map by using Coot (37). After refinement with REFMAC (27) using the native data set to 1.6-Å resolution, phases from this model and the MAD phases were combined in SIGMAA (38) to generate an improved map. A complete model of MotB-C, except for the four C-terminal residues, was built from this map in a semiautomatic fashion by using Coot and ARP/WARP (39). The structure of the MotB-C/NAM complex was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (27) with a crystallographic tetramer observed in the native crystal as a search model. Gel Filtration Chromatography and MALLS Analysis. The absolute hydrated molecular mass of MotB-C in solution was determined by MALLS analysis coupled to gel filtration chromatography. The sample containing 400 g of

MotB-C at a concentration of 8 ­10 mg/ml (similar to the concentration used in crystallization) was loaded onto a Superdex 200 24/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer 1 [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 200 mM NaCl], 2 [buffer 1 200 mM (NH4)2SO4], 3 [100 mM Tris (pH 6.4), 200 mM NaCl], and 4 [buffer 3 200 mM (NH4)2SO4] flowing at 0.5 ml/min. The eluant was passed through an in-line DAWN EOS 18 laser pho688 nm) and an Optilab rEX refractometer (Wyatt Technologies). tometer ( For calculations of the molecular mass and hydrodynamic radius, the lightscattered intensity and the refractive index were analyzed (Table S3).
