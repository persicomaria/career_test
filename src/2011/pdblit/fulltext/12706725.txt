In addition to many small molecular mass sweeteners there are in nature a few sweet proteins. The molecular volume of sweet proteins is so different from that of common sweeteners that it was difficult to understand how molecules as large as proteins can activate a receptor designed to host small molecules. We have recently shown that sweet proteins can activate the sweet receptor by a mechanism of interaction, called ``wedge model'', in which proteins fit a large cavity of the receptor with wedge-shaped surfaces of their structures. In order to substantiate this model we have designed, expressed and characterized seven mutants of MNEI, a single chain monellin. Three uncharged residues of the interaction surface, Met42, Tyr63 and Tyr65, were changed either into acidic or basic residues whereas Asp68, a key acidic residue, was changed into a basic one. As a general trend, we observe that an increase of the negative charge is much more detrimental for sweetness than an increase of positive charge. In addition we show that by a careful choice of a residue at the center of the interface between MNEI and receptor, it is possible even to increase the sweetness of MNEI. These results are fully consistent with the wedge model.

Introduction
Diseases related to the consumption of sugars require the availability of powerful but totally harmless sweeteners. The recent discovery of the sweet taste receptor opens new perspectives but in order to design new sweeteners it is necessary to clarify the mechanisms of interaction of sweet molecules with their receptor. T1R2-T1R3, the receptor activated by sweet molecules, is a class C G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with sequence homology to the mGluR1 receptor.1 Class C receptors, beside the transmembrane helices, have a large dimeric extracellular domain containing two active sites for ligands. The main structural difference between the T1R2-T1R3 sweet receptor and mGluR1 is that the Glu receptor is homodimeric whereas the sweet receptor is heterodimeric. A unique feature is that, while the

ligands of mGluR1 are either glutamate or closely related molecules, the ligands that can activate the sweet taste receptor cover a particularly wide range of chemical constitution and dimensions, ranging from sugars to amino acids, small peptides, proteins and several unrelated classes of organic compounds. Recently, on the basis of an exhaustive homology modeling of the receptor, we have proposed a mechanism that explains and predicts semi-quantitatively the sweet taste of small molecular mass compounds.2 This mechanism supports the hypothesis that in the sweet taste receptor the binding sites for small molecular mass sweeteners correspond to the binding site of glutamate in mGluR1. Thus it is fair to state that the interaction of small sweeteners, even if not completely elucidated in detail, follows the model of other class C receptors. In addition to the many small molecular mass sweeteners existing in nature or designed by targeted research, a few sweet proteins have also been found. 3 The molecular volume of sweet proteins is so different from that of common sweeteners that, at the time of their discovery,

449 mechanism2,5 does provide a simple explanation for the critical role played by T1R3 in the interaction with sweet proteins without invoking an additional site in the Cys-rich region. Can we ``prove'' this mechanism? We have tried to answer this question in two indirect ways. The quoted mechanism2 for small sweeteners would be compatible also with the interaction of proteins if one could identify, on the surface of the proteins, protruding structural elements able to probe the active site, i.e. ``sweet fingers'' whose tip is chemically similar to small sweeteners. However, it is difficult to identify these elements by sequence alignment since among sweet proteins there is no sequence homology. There is also little similarity among the tertiary structures of the sweet proteins of known 3D structure, i.e. brazzein, monellin and thaumatin. The only common elements among the three proteins are small segments of secondary structure, -sheet loops that host residues with glucophores already identified in small sweeteners. However, when we synthesized cyclic peptides that mimic these potential sweet fingers, we found that, although they have conformations consistent with those of the same sequences in the parent proteins, none of them tasted sweet.7 We have addressed the problem also from more general points of view. In the first approach we tried to identify potential ``hot spots'' on the surface of MNEI by means of integrated NMR techniques, based on the use of a paramagnetic probe. 8 Secondly, by studying G16A MNEI, a structural mutant in which an apparently minor structural change inside the hydrophobic core causes a huge decrease of biological activity.9 Both studies suggest that the glucophores are spread on a surface larger than that of a sweet finger and thus support indirectly the wedge model of interaction.2,5 A more direct way to prove the wedge model is to change the (proposed) surface of interaction of one of the sweet proteins by point directed mutagenesis, exploiting the knowledge supplied by the structure of the complexes with the model receptor. Here we have designed, expressed and characterized six mutants in which uncharged residues of the interaction surface were changed either into acidic or basic residues and another one in which a key acidic residue was changed into a basic one. By this approach we could find a mutant sweeter than MNEI itself. In addition we observed that, as a general trend, an increase of the negative charge is more detrimental for sweetness than an increase of positive charge.

most researchers believed that they probably interacted with a receptor different from that of small sweeteners. It has now been demonstrated that all sweet molecules interact with the same T1R2-T1R3 receptor.4 However, it was difficult to understand how molecules as large as proteins can activate a receptor designed to host small molecules. We have recently shown2,5 that sweet proteins can activate the sweet receptor by binding to a site different from those that can host small sweeteners. Binding of proteins on the surface of the receptor can stabilize an active form of the sweet receptor even in the absence of any small molecular mass sweetener. This mechanism of interaction was called ``wedge model'' since in silico docking of brazzein, monellin and thaumatin to the homology model of T1R2T1R3 showed that all three proteins fit a large cavity of the receptor with wedge-shaped surfaces of their structures. Figure 1 shows how the equilibrium between the inactive free form I with the active free form II can be shifted towards the active form by small molecular mass sweeteners (upper panel) or by a sweet protein; in the cartoon the sweet protein is MNEI, a single chain construct of monellin, (lower panel). A different additional site for sweet proteins, was proposed by Jiang et al.6 Using human/mouse chimeras of T1R3 paired with human T1R2, these authors determined that residues 536­545 of the cysteine-rich region of human T1R3 were necessary for responsiveness to brazzein. It is not easy to tell whether this is a genuine active site or just a critical region that cannot be easily perturbed without affecting the global response of the receptor. Data from other class C receptors suggest a predominantly structural role for the Cys-rich region of all metabotropic receptors. Any mutation in this region may undermine the structural integrity of the sweet receptor. On the other hand, the wedge

Results and Discussion
MNEI structure The solution structure of MNEI was originally solved at pH 2.9, mainly for historical reasons.10

450 Although the protein retains its full sweetness at this pH, we preferred to make the sensory analysis of the new mutants at pH 7. Accordingly, we decided to resort to a full structure determination of MNEI at pH 7, so that structural comparisons of the mutants with the solution structure of MNEI, to check their structural integrity, could be made in comparable conditions. Interproton distances were derived from the crosspeak integrals in the 15N edited 3D NOESY-HSQC11 with a 100 ms mixing time and in 2D NOESY spectra in H2O or 2H2O solution with an 80 ms mixing period. (Table 1 of the supplementary material summarizes the relevant statistics of the structure determination procedures). The calculation of the spatial structure of MNEI, based on the experimental restraints, was done with DYANA 1.512 and AMBER 5.0 package.13 The details of the calculation are given in Materials and Methods. Although the statistics (Table 1, supplementary material) reflect the lower quality of the structure at pH 7.0 with respect to the high resolution one at pH 2.9 there is no doubt that the structure is substantially unchanged in the interval 2.9­7.0. As a further check we compared the mean structure at pH 7.0 with the corresponding mean structure at pH 2.9 and with the high resolution Xray structure of SCM, a single chain monellin that differs from MNEI only by the two linking residues,14 i.e. Gly51-Phe52. Only structured secondary traits were compared. (Figure 3S of the supplementary materials shows these superpositions.) The r.m.s.d.s are 1.3 ) for the mean structures of MNEI at pH 2.9 and pH 7.0 (panel A) and 1.5 ) for the mean structure of MNEI at pH 7.0 and SCM (panel B), respectively. Therefore, we can be sure that the architecture of MNEI is unchanged in the pH range 2.9­7.0 and confidently use NMR spectra to assess the structural integrity and correct folding of the mutants. Mutants design Ideally, in order to validate the mechanism of interaction of proteins with the taste receptor, it would be desirable to be able to pick up pairs of facing residues in the interface, one from a sweet protein and another from the receptor, and mutate them accordingly either to destroy or to enhance sweetness. Unfortunately, the homology models of the human receptor do not have the necessary resolution to predict the effect of point mutations with such a precision. However, it is clear that the cavity on the surface of the T1R2-T1R3 receptor that can host sweet proteins is characterized by a prevalently negative electrostatic potential.2,5 Consistently, the wedge model of interaction of sweet proteins with the sweet taste receptor hints at a largely positive nature of the complementary surface of interaction of the sweet protein. It is interesting to note that the possible importance of charged residues on the surface of sweet proteins had been hinted at by Kohmura et al.15 for monellin,

van der Wel for thaumatin16 and Jin et al. for brazzein17 even without a detailed knowledge of the receptor surface. Therefore we reasoned that, as a rule of thumb, mutation of non-charged residues, on the interacting protein surface, into residues with negatively charged side-chains ought to be more deleterious for sweetness than mutations changing neutral residues into ones with positively charged sidechains. Obviously such a rule is very rough, since both the surface of the receptor and the surface of MNEI interacting with it are characterized by a precise alternation of positive, negative and neutral zones. Therefore, zooming in to choose the most significant residues to mutate, we examined the interacting surface in greater detail and made good use also of all known mutagenesis data. Extensive mutagenesis studies have been performed on monellin and on SCM, one of its single chain analogs.15,18 Residues whose mutation leads to substantial loss of activity, cluster on the side of MNEI that, according to our docking studies interacts with the receptor2,5 and are supported by experimental studies by a paramagnetic probe8 and by the structure of the G16A mutant.9 Figure 2 shows a model of MNEI docked on the external cavity of the sweet receptor that acts as an active site for proteins according to the wedge model.2 Figure 2(a) shows the surface of the sweet protein in direct contact with the receptor; the receptor is shown as a see-through line representation. Figure 2(b) corresponds to a rotation of 180° around a vertical axis, i.e. it shows the surface of the protein in contact with the external environment. The residues whose mutation causes a decrease of one order of magnitude in sweetness (Q13, K36, K43, R72, R88 and P92­P96) are colored in purple, those that give rise to a decrease of two or more orders of magnitude (I6, D7, G9 and R39) are colored in dark violet.9 It can be seen that mutations detrimental to sweetness are all on the face of MNEI interacting with the receptor. Besides, they are clustered on an area smaller than the total interacting surface but clearly protruding from the protein surface, i.e. the tip of the ``wedge''. This area, highlighted in Figure 2(c) by a thin golden circle, is bordered by I6, D7, G9, Q13, K36, K43, R72, R88 and P92­P96 and has, at its center, R39. We have looked for neutral residues, on this face, that had not been previously mutated into charged ones. The best candidate appears to be Y65, since it sits next to R39, the basic residue at the center of this face, in an area surrounded by other key residues. As a direct negative check we selected for mutation D68, the residue that delimits the area on the right-hand side and that in addition is one of the residues previously indicated as glucophores of a likely sweet finger.7,19 The presence of key acidic residues, such as D7 and D68, in the crucial interacting area does not contradict the assumption that the surface of interaction of the sweet protein is largely positive, it only reminds us that the interacting surface has a complex nature. We thought it

interesting to check whether even a residue that is required to be acidic for an optimal interaction can tolerate a mutation into a basic one. In addition we selected also two other neutral residues, M42 and Y63. They are on the border of the crucial interacting area, as viewed from the tip of the wedge (Figure 2(c)) but, owing to the depth of the receptor cavity, can still play an important role in the interaction. Their mutation into basic or acidic residues can be of high diagnostic value to evaluate the validity of the rough criterion of preferring changes towards more positive rather than negative charge mutations. Accordingly, we expressed two series of mutants in which each of the selected neutral residues is changed either into arginine or glutamic acid, i.e. M42E, Y63E ,Y65E and M42R, Y63R, Y65R and the single D68R mutant. Mutant expression and structural integrity All mutants were expressed in conditions very similar to those previously employed for MNEI. Minor differences were observed for the purification protocol (see Materials and Methods). Careful check of the structural integrity of the mutants is essential if we want to make a meaningful comparison of their sweetening power. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that all mutants have secondary structure populations qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of MNEI. Figure 3 shows the 1D 1H NMR spectra of MNEI and those of two key mutants: Y63E, the mutant with lowest sweetening power and Y65R, which is even sweeter than MNEI. Each spectrum exhibits peaks at high field (around 0.0 ppm arising from aliphatic protons ring current shifted by aromatic side-chains in the protein hydrophobic core) and a good dispersion of the NH resonances at low field that are characteristic for folded proteins.

Sensory analysis When assayed by a panel of trained tasters the sweetness of MNEI in which M42 is mutated into an arginine (relative to MNEI, taken as 100) drops by an order of magnitude, i.e. to 10, but if it is changed into a glutamic acid the relative sweetness is a bare 2.5. Similarly the figures for Y63R and Y63E are 20 and 1, respectively. In the case of Y65, mutation into arginine leads to a substantial increase of relative

452 sweetness to 167 and to a decrease for Y65E to 5. Even for the D68 the mutation into a basic residue is well tolerated, since its sweetness decreases to 10. The results are summarized in Figure 4 as histograms, compared to the sweetness of MNEI. The sweetness of Y65R MNEI is considerably higher than that of MNEI, whereas all other mutants score values lower than MNEI. It is interesting to observe that the three basic mutants of neutral residues score, on the average, much better than the corresponding acidic ones that are essentially deprived of all sweetening power. The D68R mutant is obviously a case apart. The observation that its sweetening power is lower than that of the original construct, only confirms the obvious fact that the surface of interaction is not uniformly positive (vide infra). Mutants surfaces A simple way to evaluate the pros and cons of the residues that we chose for mutation is to check not only the area of MNEI that is supposed to interact with the receptor but also the environment of the chosen MNEI residue on the receptor's side. If we choose the alpha carbon atom of residue 65 as a reference point and look for either acidic or basic residues at close enough distance to allow interactions, we find that there are four acidic residues of the receptor whose alpha carbon atom is closer than 8 ) (D169, E170, D173 and D218, all from T1R2) and one (D170) at a distance shorter than 6 ). The corresponding basic residues of the receptor that are close enough to interact with residue 65 of MNEI are R172, R176 and R217 whose alpha carbons are closer than 8 ), but there is no receptor's residue whose alpha carbon is closer than 6 ). On this basis it is clear that mutation of Y65 into a basic residue ought to be more favorable than one into an acidic residue. By choosing the alpha carbon atom of residue 68 as a

Design of a Sweeter Monellin

reference point we find three acidic residues of the receptor whose alpha carbon atom is closer than 6 ) (D169, D173 and D188). This finding suggests that even a change into a residue of opposite charge might be tolerated in this case. If we choose the alpha carbon atom of residue 42 as a reference point and look for either acidic or basic residues at close enough distance to allow interactions, we find only two acidic residues whose alpha carbon atom is closer than 8 ) (E987 and D1055) but no residue at less than 6 ). However, there are no basic residues around M42 even at distances smaller than 12 ). Similarly for Y63 there are two acidic residues whose alpha carbon atom is closer than 8 ) (E886 and E987) but no residue at less than 6 ) and no basic residues at distances smaller than 8 ). A more rigorous way to interpret the results of mutations is to examine in detail the electrostastic potential of the surface of every mutant corresponding to the face of MNEI that interacts with the receptor. The calculation of this surface parameter is straightforward once we have the structure of each mutant. Owing to the survey of the 1D NMR spectra, it is fair to assume that the fold of the mutant proteins is not exceedingly perturbed with respect to that of MNEI. Another way to check the structural integrity of the mutants is in fact to build a homology model for each of them. We preferred to build accurate homology models, as opposed to just changing the single residue with a graphics program in order to check whether the mutation, albeit always of exposed residues, induced any change in the protein architecture. We built homology models of all mutants using the solution structure of monellin as template10 and calculated the surface electrostatic potential for each of them. All models showed that mutation of the chosen residues into either basic or acidic residues does not disturb the architecture of MNEI and did not induce even local structural changes, apart from

the trivial difference in the side-chain of the chosen residue. These observations are fully consistent with the spectra of Figure 3. Figure 5 shows the comparison of the surface of MNEI with those of Y65R, Y65E and D68R. The critical area that we chose for mutations is identified, as in Figure 2(c) by a thin golden circle. The electrostatic potential of this area is mainly positive, but the area contains neutral parts and is bordered by negative spots. It is easy to observe that the surface of Y65R is qualitatively very similar to that of MNEI. The main difference between the two is an intensification of the positive area centered around R39, but the borders of the area, lined by key negative spots, are accurately preserved. On the contrary, the surface of Y65E shows a great reduction of the positive area and conversely, that of D68R an almost complete disappearance of one of the negative spots on the right-hand side of the area. The electrostatic potentials of the other four mutants are consistent with these observations. The striking result of a mutant sweeter than MNEI itself asks for a more careful examination of the structural integrity of Y65R with respect to MNEI, since only if the two structures are very similar can we attribute changes in their sweetening power to

slight changes on their surfaces. Figure 6 shows the comparison of the 1H-15N correlation spectra of the two proteins. The inset shows a representation of the loop that hosts Y65 in MNEI with the side-chains of the most affected residues. The side-chains of residues of the loop are colored in gold, save Y65 whose side-chain is colored in red. The side-chains of Y29 and I38 are colored in blue. It can be appreciated that, apart from side-chain nitrogen atoms and a Gly NH whose intensity is too low to judge a possible displacement, most cross-peaks do not move, indicating that the architecture of the protein is not influenced by the Y65R mutation. The only appreciable changes are localized to residues in the close neighborhood of Y65. The most shifted NH resonances are those of Y65 and A66 whose NHs are under the influence of the aromatic ring of Y65, as can be appreciated from the inset of Figure 6. Mutation of Y65 into R65 relieves both NHs from this influence.

Conclusion
In a continuing effort to elucidate the mechanism of interaction of sweet proteins with the sweet taste receptor, we have described here the design,

454 expression and characterization of seven mutants of MNEI, a single chain monellin. According to the mechanism2,5 termed wedge model, sweet proteins activate the sweet receptor by binding to an external site and thus stabilizing an active form of the sweet receptor even in the absence of small molecular mass sweeteners. Several indirect studies have already validated the wedge model6­9 but we tried, here, to find a more direct validation. A rather direct way to test the model is the design of mutants consistent with the surface of interaction. Such an approach would require, in general, a detailed knowledge of the interface between a sweet protein and its receptor, particularly if the area of interaction were rather limited, as in the case of sweet fingers. The homology models of the human receptor do not have the necessary resolution to predict the effect of point mutations with great precision. However, in the case of the wedge model, it is also possible to make more rough predictions and try to verify them. As shown by docking calculations,2,5 this mechanism of interaction hints at a largely positive nature of the surface of interaction of the protein with the receptor. Accordingly the expectation for the taste of these mutants was that, in order to be consistent with the wedge model, all changes of neutral residues to acidic ones ought to be more detrimental for sweetness than the corresponding ones into basic residues. The seven mutants of MNEI described here were chosen by selecting a critical area of interaction hosting key residues according to previous mutagenesis studies. Three neutral residues, M42, Y63 and Y65, comprised in this area were changed either into acidic or basic residues. As a negative check we also selected D68, one of the residues that borders the area and, in addition, one of the residues previously indicated as glucophores of a likely sweet finger. D68 was changed into a basic one. The general expectation that changes to acidic residues ought to be more detrimental for sweetness than the corresponding changes into basic residues was met by all mutants. Even more remarkable is the fact that the D68R mutation, in spite of the clearly critical role of D68 in the interacting surface, did not completely suppress sweetness. In addition, careful selection of the best point mutation, i.e. Y65, led to the most exciting ``byproduct'' of this approach: the discovery of a mutant, Y65R, that is even sweeter than MNEI itself. Y65 is at the center of the main interacting area predicted by the wedge model and close comparison of the surface electrostatic potential of MNEI and Y65R reveals that indeed the only change in going from MNEI to the mutant is an increase of the positive area of the interface at the expense of a neutral patch, without significant changes in the alternation of positive and negative areas on the crucial region of interaction. We believe that the results presented here fully validate the wedge model; future work on more specific mutants may lead to even sweeter proteins.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression The recombinant polypeptide of MNEI was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cells harboring the pET-22b+ plasmid. Unlabeled protein was obtained from the mentioned E. coli grown in TB medium. After sonication and centrifugation of the cellular pellet suspended in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5), the protein, fully present in the supernatant, can be purified by ion exchange chromatography on an S-Sepharose column with sodium acetate and a sodium chloride concentration gradient.10 Final purification can be achieved by gel filtration on a P-30 column. The 15N-labeled protein was expressed in M9 medium containing 1 g/l of 99% 15NH4Cl (Cortec, Paris, France) as the sole nitrogen source. NMR measurements on unlabeled samples were performed at pH 7.0 and 308 K, using a 2 mM solution of the protein in 90% H2O/10% 2 H2O with 18.5 mM potassium phosphate buffer for the H2O spectra or in 99% 2H2O with 18.5 mM potassium phosphate buffer for the 2H2O spectra. 15N-labeled MNEI was expressed in E coli as described.9 Mutants plasmids were prepared using the QuickChange Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), starting from the pET-22b+ plasmid cDNA coding for MNEI. The purification procedure required only minor adjustments of the pH and/or gradient elution. NMR measurements on unlabeled samples were performed at pH 7.0 and 308 K, using a 2 mM solution of the protein in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O with 18.5 mM potassium phosphate buffer for the H2O spectra or in 99% 2H2O with 18.5 mM potassium phosphate buffer for the 2H2O spectra. NMR spectroscopy The structure of MNEI was determined by NMR techniques using unlabeled and 15N-labeled recombinant protein samples dissolved in the appropriate volume of either an H2O or 2H2O solution, containing 18.5 mM potassium phosphate, to make a 1.0 mM sample, adjusted to pH 7.0, at 35 °C. NMR measurements were performed on Bruker 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers. Data processing was performed with NMRPipe20 and spectral analysis with NMRView.28 The 1H chemical shifts are relative to trimethylsilylpropionic 2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TSP) as 0.0 ppm. The 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referred to the 1H chemical shifts according to magnetogiric ratios.21 Resonance assignments were obtained from 2D and 3D experiments. Total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra22 were collected with mixing times in the range 50 to 75 ms. The nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra23 were recorded with mixing times of 70, 100 and 120 ms. TPPI was applied to achieve quadrature detection in the virtual dimension.24 Water suppression was achieved either by presaturation or by using the WATERGATE pulse sequence.25 Data size was typically 512 × 2048 complex points in the t1 and t2 time-domains, which was zero-filled to obtain 2048 × 4096 data points in the spectrum. The heteronuclear-edited 3D experiments used in the assignment procedure were 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC11 and 1 H- 15 N TOCSY-HSQC. 14 Data sizes were typically 150 × 32 × 512 complex points in the t1, t2 and t3 timedomains, which was zero-filled to obtain 256 × 128 × 1024 data points in the spectrum.

negative control. The subject tasted the compound without any time constrains, then spat it and rinsed with tap water within a 1 min interval. Each subject tested each stimulus three times, and the presentations were randomized. The sweetness threshold of the samples was evaluated by means of a triangle test for taste threshold.31 Three paper cups, one containing 5 ml of protein solution and the others containing 5 ml of distilled water, were given to the panel, who were asked to indicate which cup had the taste-eliciting solution. The sample solutions were provided in the order of concentration from the lowest (25 nM) to the highest (5 M) level of sweetness. Solutions were adjusted to pH 7.0 with 0.1 M NaOH or HCl. The relative sweetness percentage was calculated by: relative sweetness percentage = (MNEI threshold/sample threshold) × 100. Model building The homology models of all mutants of MNEI were built using the SWISS MODEL tool of EXPASY in the optimization mode 32 33 34 using, as template, the coordinates of the mean solution structure of MNEI (1fa3.pdb). The option NQUA of the QUALITY menu of WHAT IF35 yielded for the original structure, used as template, a value of -0.61, within the range of properly refined X-ray structures (0 ± 1). The corresponding values for the mutants were comprised between -1.6 and -1.2. Calculation of the electrostatic potential on the contact surface was performed with Molmol.30

JNH-CH coupling constants were measured by means of 3D HNHA, a 1H-15N -1H correlation experiment.26 Data size was 64 × 31 × 512 complex points in the t1, t2andt3 time-domains, which was zero-filled to obtain 256 × 128 × 1024 data points in the spectrum. Series of decoupled HSQC experiments27 were used to identify amide protons with slowed exchange, after dissolving the freeze-dried protein in 99% 2H2O and to measure amide temperature coefficients in the temperature range 278­328 K. Calculation of the three-dimensional structure Interproton distances were derived from the cross-peak integrals in the 15N edited 3D NOESY-HSQC11 with a 100 ms mixing time and in 2D NOESY spectra in H2O or 2 H2O solution with an 80 ms mixing period. The peak integrals were evaluated with the program NMRView,28 transferred to the program package DYANA 1.512 and converted to the upper distance limits by using CALIBA.29 In the structure calculation with DYANA, spin coupling values were input into HABAS29 to obtain the possible range of torsion angles with simultaneous consideration of the NOE-derived distance restraints, to yield 172 angular constraints. Several rounds of calculations were repeated from the initially obtained solid NOE assignments to extend the assignments of the NOE peaks, using as filter in the NMRView analysis the preliminary structure determined in the previous calculation step. During the DYANA calculation using the simulated annealing protocol in dihedral angle space dynamics, we collected all possible distance and angle restraints. Typical DYANA runs were performed on 100 randomly generated starting structures with 10,000 torsion angle dynamics steps. 958 nuclear Overhauser enhancement-derived distance restraints and 172 dihedral angle restraints, obtained from direct measurement of three-bond spin coupling constants, were used in the last DYANA runs. The 40 DYANA structures with the lowest target function values were subjected to restrained energy minimization using the SANDER module of AMBER 5.0 package.13 In order to reduce the artifacts that can arise during in vacuo simulation, the charge of the ionizable groups was reduced to 20% of its full value. A distance cutoff of 8 ) was used in the evaluation of non-bonded interactions. Distance restraints were applied as a flat well with parabolic penalty within 0.5 ) outside the upper bound, and a linear function beyond 0.5 ), using a force constant of 16 kcal mol-1 )-2, whereas a force constant of 16 kcal mol-1 rad-2 was used for angle restraints. No hydrogen bond restraints were used during this phase of the refinement. The restrained energy minimization was carried out with a total of 2000 steps of conjugated gradient minimization for each conformer. The best 20 structures, among those with a residual restraint energy lower than -800 kcal mol-1, were selected to represent the solution structure. To display the final structures, calculations of the mean coordinate of the ensemble structures and their r.m.s.d. values relative to the mean were carried out with the programs MOLMOL.30 Sensory analysis The taste panel tasted four peptides, nine different monellins as positive controls, and deionized water as the
