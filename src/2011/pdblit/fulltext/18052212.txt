ABSTRACT: Pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) catalyzes the reversible conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), AMP, and Pi to pyruvate and ATP. The enzyme contains two remotely located reaction centers: the nucleotide partial reaction takes place at the N-terminal domain, and the PEP/pyruvate partial reaction takes place at the C-terminal domain. A central domain, tethered to the N- and C-terminal domains by two closely associated linkers, contains a phosphorylatable histidine residue (His455). The molecular architecture suggests a swiveling domain mechanism that shuttles a phosphoryl group between the two reaction centers. In an early structure of PPDK from Clostridium symbiosum, the His445-containing domain (His domain) was positioned close to the nucleotide binding domain and did not contact the PEP/pyruvatebinding domain. Here, we present the crystal structure of a second conformational state of C. symbiosum PPDK with the His domain adjacent to the PEP-binding domain. The structure was obtained by producing a three-residue mutant protein (R219E/E271R/S262D) that introduces repulsion between the His and nucleotide-binding domains but preserves viable interactions with the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain. Accordingly, the mutant enzyme is competent in catalyzing the PEP/pyruvate half-reaction but the overall activity is abolished. The new structure confirms the swivel motion of the His domain. In addition, upon detachment from the His domain, the two nucleotide-binding subdomains undergo a hinge motion that opens the active-site cleft. A similar hinge motion is expected to accompany nucleotide binding (cleft closure) and release (cleft opening). A model of the coupled swivel and cleft opening motions was generated by interpolation between two end conformations, each with His455 positioned for phosphoryl group transfer from/to one of the substrates. The trajectory of the His domain avoids major clashes with the partner domains while preserving the association of the two linker segments.

The study reported here was undertaken to define a conformational state of pyruvate phosphate dikinase from C. symbiosum (CsPPDK),1 which, together with the conformation of the enzyme described earlier (1), provides experimental support for our proposed enzyme mechanism invoking a swiveling domain that shuttles a phosphoryl group between two remote reaction centers.

interconversion of ATP, Pi, and pyruvate with AMP, PPi, and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the presence of Mg2+ and K+/Na+ (2). The three-step reversible reaction proceeds via phosphoenzyme and pyrophosphoenzyme intermediates with a histidine residue serving as the phosphocarrier (3-5).

PPDK has been found in bacteria, in C4 and Crassulacean acid metabolism plants, and in parasites, but not in higher animal forms. In bacteria and parasites, PPDK functions in the direction of ATP synthesis, reminiscent of pyruvate kinase (2, 6). In plants and in photosynthetic bacteria, PPDK functions in PEP formation, potentiating the rate of CO2 fixation that takes place during photosynthesis (7). PPDK exhibits sequence homology to pyruvate phosphate synthase and to another enzyme that utilizes phosphotransfer from PEP to a histidine residues, enzyme I of the PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) (8). PPDK assembles into homodimers of 95 kDa subunit molecular mass. The monomer is composed of three domains and contains two distinct reaction centers. Each reaction

Lim et al. nopyruvate, a PEP analogue, confirmed the location of the PEP binding site and identified the key residues involved (11). In both apo and phosphonopyruvate-bound structures, the nucleotide binding site is partially blocked by a loop, requiring that the nucleotide-binding domain undergoes a conformational transition upon binding of Mg2+, ATP, and Pi. Subsequent to the structure determination of CsPPDK, the structure of PPDK from the African protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (TbPPDK) was determined at 3.0 Å resolution (12). The structure showed the same arrangement of the three domains, except that the two ATP grasp subdomains adopted a more open, substrate-accessible conformation. Support for the swiveling domain mechanism was provided by the 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure determination of maize PPDK (MzPPDK) (13), an enzyme that functions in the direction of PEP formation. In this structure, the His domain is oriented toward the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain but is not sufficiently close to the binding site for productive phosphoryl group transfer between PEP/pyruvate and the reactive histidine residue. While the collection of structures provides compelling evidence of the swiveling domain mechanism, so far the hypothesis has not been validated for the same PPDK molecule. This work provides direct experimental confirmation that the His domain of the same PPDK molecule can swivel around its linkers to adopt the two extreme conformational states. The new, second conformational state was obtained by introducing three mutations in the nucleotide-binding domain that repel the His domain and promote an alternative interaction with the PEP/pyruvatebinding domain. Kinetic analysis showed that the overall activity of the mutant enzyme was abolished; however, the mutant was competent in catalyzing the PEP/pyruvate halfreaction. This new structure sheds light on flexibility requirements in PPDK, an issue relevant to other enzymes that utilize the swiveling mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning, Expression, and Purification. The triple mutant PPDK (R219E/S262D/E271R) was produced by using the PCR-based strategy described previously (14). Mutagenic primers, 18-22 base pairs in length, were synthesized by Gibco BRL Life Science. BglII and BstXI restriction sites were employed in mutant construction. The sequence of the mutant gene was confirmed by the Center for Agricultural Biotechnology at the University of Maryland. The mutant gene was expressed in Escherichia coli JM101 cells, and the protein product was purified to homogeneity (as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis) by the methods described previously (14). Rapid-Quench Analysis of PPDK-Catalyzed SingleTurnoVer Reactions of [32P]PEP. [32P]PEP was synthesized and purified from [ -32P]ATP according to the procedure described previously (15). [ -32P]ATP (>1 Ci/mmol in specific activity) was custom-synthesized by NEN Life Science Products. The single-turnover reactions of 40 µM R219E/S262D/E271R PPDK, 5 µM [32P]PEP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM NH4Cl in 50 mM K+ Hepes (pH 7.0, 25 °C) were carried out in a rapid-quench instrument from KinTek Instruments. Reactions were initiated by mixing 32

center is responsible for half of the overall catalytic reaction (9). The N-terminal domain [adopting the so-called ATP grasp fold (1)] carries out the ATP/AMP reaction (nucleotidebinding domain), and the C-terminal domain [adopting an R/ barrel fold (1)] carries out the PEP/pyruvate reaction (PEP/pyruvate-binding domain). The phospho-carrier histidine residue (His455 in CsPPDK) is located on a domain (His domain) that corresponds to the middle region of the polypeptide chain (3). The His domain shuttles the phosphate group between the two remotely located substrate binding sites (45 Å apart). Its fold is unique to PPDK (1) and to the His domain of enzyme I (10). The first crystal structure of CsPPDK was determined at 2.3 Å resolution (1) and later the resolution was extended to 1.94 Å resolution (11). In that structure, the His domain is tethered to the partner domains by two linkers that appear as an independent folding unit. The His and nucleotide-binding domains are closely associated and His455 faces the nucleotide binding site (Figure 1A). Modeling showed that if the His domain swivels around the two linker segments, it may be brought to interact with the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain such that His455 faces the PEP/pyruvate binding site.

Structure modifications in accordance with the electron density map were made with the O interactive graphics program (21). A single temperature factor was refined for each of the four domains of CsPPDK and then for each amino acid residue. The application of single-residue temperature factors was assessed to be appropriate because it led to significant reduction in the free-R value. Final refinement cycles were performed with the REFMAC program, employing TLS parameters (four domains) to model anisotropic displacements. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Mutant Design. In the following discussion, the CsPPDK conformation observed in all earlier crystal structures is referred to as CsPPDK1 [see for example the PDB entry code of the most accurate structure determined at 1.94 Å resolution, 1kbl (11), Figure 1A], whereas the structure reported here will be referred to as CsPPDK2. Following a number of failed attempts to obtain a structure of CsPPDK2, a strategy that employed site-directed mutagenesis proved successful. Replacement of three residues in the nucleotide binding domain (R219E/S262D/ E271R) was expected to result in repulsion between the His domain and the nucleotide-binding domain. Inspection of the environment of these residues showed that the replacement R219E could potentially introduce electrostatic repulsion between the newly introduced carboxylate group and the backbone carbonyl groups of the His domain's Pro433 and Glu434, as well as the carboxylate groups of Glu434 and Glu437 (Figure 2A). For a S262D replacement in the context of the CsPPDK1 conformation, the newly introduced carboxylate group would be oriented toward the carbonyl groups of Pro397 and Ala398, again forming unfavorable electrostatic interactions (Figure 2B). Finally, the mutation E271R would eliminate the carboxylate group interaction with two main-chain amide groups on the His domain, Met452 and Thr453, and would instead introduce both electrostatic and steric repulsion (Figure 2C). All three mutated residues are located outside the nucleotide binding cleft. By modification of the nucleotide-binding domain residues while the amino acid sequence of the His domain was preserved, the potential interactions between the His domain and the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain were not affected. Indeed, CsPPDK2 exhibits a conformation in which the His domain sways away from the nucleotide-binding domain toward the PEP/pyruvatebinding domain (Figure 1B). The kinetic characterization reported below confirmed the preservation of productive interaction between the His and PEP/pyruvate-binding domains. In contrast, when complementary mutations were made on the His domain (E434A/E437A and T453A, the positions of which are shown in Figure 1, panels A and C, respectively), both nucleotide and PEP partial reactions were impaired (22).

The protein was precipitated from quenched solutions by vigorous mixing with CCl4 and separated by centrifugation. The protein pellet (dissolved in 500 µL of boiling 10 N H2SO4) and supernatant were analyzed for 32P radioactivity by scintillation counting. The percent conversion was deduced from the ratio of unconsumed [32P]PEP (in the supernatant) and produced E-P (in protein pellet) in each reaction. The product (E-P) formation (micromolar concentration) was calculated by multiplying the initial substrate concentration by the percent conversion. Time course data of product formation were fit to a singleexponential equation (eq 1) with the KaleidaGraph program to yield the rate constants for the single-turnover reactions.

Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection. Crystals were obtained at 30 °C in hanging drops by the vapor diffusion method. The protein solution (28 mg/mL) contained 20 mM imidazole (pH 6.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM DTT. The reservoir solution contained 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Na+Hepes (pH 7.0). The hanging drops consisted of equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature with Cu KR X-rays generated by a Siemens rotating anode, which was monochromated with Harvard mirrors and equipped with a Mar345 imaging plate detector. Data were processed with the HKL programs suite (16). The diffraction resolution limit was 3.6 Å (Table 1). The crystals belong to space group C2221, the asymmetric unit contains one PPDK molecule, and the solvent comprises 53% of the unit cell. Structure Determination. The structure was determined by molecular replacement. The computations were carried out with the program Phaser (17, 18) and autonomous domains and subdomains of the CsPPDK structure determined at 1.94

NADH-coupled spectrophotometric assay. Likewise, the rate of R219E/S262D/E271R PPDK (40 µM) catalyzed conversion of 2 mM [14C]ATP, 5 mM Pi, and 5 mM pyruvate in 50 mM K+Hepes containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 40 mM NH4Cl (pH 7.0, and 25 °C) to [14C]AMP, PPi, and PEP (equilibrium-driven with inorganic pyrophosphatase to hydrolyze PPi; monitored by HPLC separation of the reaction mixture) was too low to detect. On the other hand, PEP phosphorylation of the R219E/S262D/E271R PPDK catalytic His455, determined by transient kinetic methods, occurred at a rate comparable to that observed with wild-type PPDK. The single-time-course data shown in Figure 3 were fitted with a first-order rate equation to define a kobs ) 30 s-1 compared to the kobs ) 40 s-1 measured for the wild-type enzyme under the same conditions. Thus, the triple mutant is unable to catalyze the partial reaction at the N-terminal domain active site but retains full catalytic efficiency toward the partial reaction at the C-terminal domain. This result is consistent with impaired docking of the N-terminal domain and the His domain. Structure Determination. Structure determination by molecular replacement was not straightforward, perhaps because

of the anisotropic nature of the diffraction. The position of the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain was easily identified by the AMoRe molecular replacement program (23). However, in our hands, the remaining two domains were not resolved despite various searches that employed models of subdomains expected to undergo rigid-body motions. Ultimately, the molecular replacement solution was obtained by use of the program Phaser (17, 18) as follows. The PPDK molecule was divided into six domains, each forming an entity that appeared to form a compact autonomous folding unit. The nucleotide-binding domain contained three such units: the first folding unit spanned residues 2-111 together with 197243, the second folding unit spanned residues 112-196 (a helix bundle), and the third folding unit spanned residues 244-341. The first two folding units form the ATP grasp subdomain that is abbreviated NBD1 in the following discussion, and the third folding unit corresponds to the second ATP grasp subdomain that is abbreviated NBD2. The cleft between the two subdomains defines the nucleotide binding site (1, 14, 24, 25). A fourth fragment used in the molecular replacement included residues 342-377 spanning the linker between the nucleotide-binding domain and the His domain. The molecular replacement search model for the His domain spanned residues 378-517 and the PEP/ pyruvate-binding domain search model spanned residues 518-873. The position of the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain was easily resolved with Phaser as it was with AMoRe. Next, with the already identified PEP/pyruvate-binding domain included as a partial model, the two nucleotide-binding subdomains were positioned in the cell. The position of the His domain remained elusive and was resolved only after the anisotropy correction in Phaser was improved. For this search, the fixed partial model included all previously resolved fragments. Analysis of the principal components of the anisotropic part of the temperature factor affecting observed amplitudes showed a difference of approximately 30 Å2 between the weakest (0k0) and strongest (h00) diffraction directions. The anisotropy may be attributed to crystal packing; the molecules pack such that the tight dimer interface (mediated by the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain) is along the a unit cell axis, dimers pack to form continuous rows along the c unit cell axis, and the least extensive intermolecular interactions occur along the b unit cell axis.

Refinement of the CsPPDK2 structure at 3.6 Å led to R values that are well within the range observed for structures refined at such limited resolution and available in the PDB. The quality of the electron density map is demonstrated in Figure 4. Consistent with the stereochemistry of the model used in the search (refined at a much higher resolution of 1.94 Å), all backbone torsion angles are within the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Surprisingly, and despite the low resolution of the data, clear electron density consistent with two sulfate ions was evident. These are located in the PEP/pyruvate-binding site, close to the His domain, and are surrounded by arginine residues. Molecular Conformation. With one molecule in the asymmetric unit, the dimer interface is formed across a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis. As in CsPPDK1, which was crystallized in a different space group (P2), interactions between subunits are mediated by the PEP/ pyruvate-binding domain. Within the resolution limit of the diffraction data, the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain has not changed compared with CsPPDK1, and the dimer interface remained unperturbed. This conclusion was confirmed computationally by superposing one PEP/pyruvate-binding domain of CsPPDK1 and CsPPDK2, which places the respective partner domain in equivalent position with root-meansquare deviation (rmsd) value for CR atoms of 0.6 Å. The position of the partner domain was further optimized by allowing independent movement of the second domain, yielding an rmsd value of 0.2 Å following a slight rotation of 1.4°. The conformations of NBD2 and the His domain are also very similar in the two structures of CsPPDK. Superposition of the CR atoms of each of these domains (excluding the two His domain linkers, Figure 1) resulted in rmsd values lower than 1 Å. In contrast, the rmsd value is larger for NBD1, at 1.9 Å. The main changes occur in two NBD1 loop regions, residues 217-232 and 98-103. In CsPPDK1, these loops are constrained by contacts with a loop encompassing

residues 793-802 on the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain. Unlike CsPPDK1, NBD1 of CsPPDK2 does not interact at all with the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain (Figure 1), enabling the two NBD1 loops (residues 217-232 and 98103) to adopt new, more extended, conformations. The change in relative orientation of NBD1 and NBD2 results in a more open nucleotide binding cleft (Figure 1), similarly to the arrangement seen in TbPPDK (12). The cleft opening is accompanied by conformational adjustment of the NBD1 loop residues 32-36. We previously described a model of ATP bound to PPDK based on ADP binding to another enzyme that contains an ATP grasp fold, D-Ala-D-Ala ligase (1). The model showed that the nucleotide's ribose site was blocked in CsPPDK1 by a NBD2 loop (residues 273-288). The conformation of this loop remains unaltered in CsPPDK2; however, the ribose site is now accessible because of the shift that NBD1 undergoes relative to NBD2. One would expect that the two subdomains undergo closure upon nucleotide binding, but the closure must be accompanied by some local adjustments that allow nucleotide access to the binding site. The two conformational states of CsPPDK reveal that the His domain rotates as a rigid body, and the rotation is facilitated by torsions around backbone bonds of segments that tether the domain to the nucleotide- and PEP/pyruvatebinding domains (Figures 1 and 5). Following Nakanishi et al. (13), the program DynDom (26) was used to analyze the quasi-rigid-body domain motion, yielding an effective hinge axis (see Table 1 for the definition of effective hinge axis). This analysis yielded a 111° rotation of the His domain along an axis approximately parallel to linker segments that adopt extended conformations (residues 373-382 and 507-520) and passing between the two. The effective hinge axis has a translation component of -1.8 Å. The swivel-like motion results in a 38 Å displacement of His455 so that it faces the nucleotide-binding domain at one extreme (as in CsPPDK1) and the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain at the other extreme

Lim et al. domain is closer to the orientation required for phosphotransfer compared with the MzPPDK His domain; the positions of the CR atoms of the reactive histidines in CsPPDK2 and MzPPDK are respectively 11 and 16 Å away from the position that would station the imidazole ring for productive phosphotransfer. These distances were calculated relative to a model (generated as described in the next section) of the CsPPDK that enables the phosphotransfer reaction to occur. Compared with CsPPDK1, the opening of the active-site clefts of the nucleotide binding domains of CsPPDK2, TbPPDK, and MzPPDK occur through a large rotation of the NBD1 subdomain (42-43°) and a smaller rotation of the NBD2 subdomain (7-13°) (Table 2). The effective hinge axis that describes the NBD2 motion is nearly perpendicular to the polypeptide segment that links the two subdomains (residues 241-245 in CsPPDK; Figure 6). The small rigidbody rotation of NBD2 can be described by a hinge motion with the axis approximately perpendicular to residues 357362 within the segment linking NBD2 and the His domain (not shown). As with CsPPDK1, the His domain of TbPPDK interacts with the nucleotide binding domain; however, the TbPPDK nucleotide-binding domain adopts an open conformation. Consequently, the His domain in TbPPDK interacts exclusively with NBD2, whereas the closed conformation of the CsPPDK1 nucleotide-binding domain leads to the His domain interacting with both NBD1 and NBD2. Phosphoryl Group Transfer between PEP and His455. The His domains of CsPPDK2 and of MzPPDK are oriented away from their respective nucleotide-binding domains toward the PEP/pyruvate-binding domains, yet in both structures the domains are positioned too far for phosphoryl group transfer. The MzPPDK crystals soaked with Mg2+-PEP revealed the phosphoryl phosphorus atom 16 Å away from the CR atom of the reactive histidine residue (13), and in fact the His domain and the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain in MzPPDK do not form interdomain contacts. The His domain and the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain in CsPPDK2 are positioned 5 Å closer together, yet this is also a loose association involving only a few van der Waals contacts. The CR atom of His455 is stationed 11 Å away from the position of the PEP's phosphorus atom [inferred from the CsPPDK structure in complex with Mg2+-phosphonopyruvate (11)] and the sidechain conformation is inaccessible for phosphoryl group transfer. To facilitate phosphoryl group transfer, the swivel angle of the His domain must be 103° rather than 111° and the His455 side chain 1 dihedral angle must be rotated by approximately 120°. The model is consistent with stereochemical studies in solution (27), which invoke the associative mechanism's in-line transfer of the phosphoryl group. At the transition state, the phosphorus is pentagonally coordinated with trigonal bipyramidal geometry and the donor and acceptor groups are at the apical positions. The structure of phosphorylated enzyme I from E. coli, determined in the presence of Mg2+ and the inhibitor oxalate (an analogue of pyruvate enolate) guided the model building (10). Interestingly, one of the sulfate ions identified in the electron density map is located in the expected site of the phosphoryl group, and this sulfate site is also observed in the apo CsPPDK1 and MzPPDK structures.

FIGURE 5: Swivel motion of the His domain. The location of the His domain was derived by superposing the PEP/pyruvate-binding domain of the CsPPDK1 and CsPPDK2 structures (Figure 1). The effective hinge axis calculated by DynDom (26) is indicated by the black line. The domain colored gold corresponds to CsPPDK1, and that in cyan corresponds to CsPPDK2.

(as in CsPPDK2). The linker segments that exhibit the largest changes in backbone torsion angles span residues 378-382 and 512-518. Bacterial, Trypanosome, and Maize PPDK Conformations The DynDom algorithm was used to compare domain orientations in the bacterial, trypanosome, and maize PPDK structures, omitting the automated domain assignment. Instead, the molecules were divided into four domains (NBD1, NBD2, His domain, and PEP/pyruvate domain), and the PEP/pyruvate domain of CsPPDK1 served as the reference structure for the comparisons. Domain assignment by structure inspection provided a common framework for all PPDK structures, in contrast to the automatic domain assignment, which yielded different domain definitions of the different enzymes. Only domain core residues common to all three proteins (comprising approximately 80% of the residues of each domain) were included to prevent spurious results arising from sequence differences of proteins from different sources that are manifested structurally. By defining domains in this manner, the PEP/pyruvate-binding domains of the various structures were superposed with CR atom rmsd values of 0.2 Å for CsPPDK2 and 0.8 Å for both MzPPDK (PDB entry code 1VBH) and TbPPDK (PDB entry code 1H6Z) (Table 2). The analysis shows that NBD2 exhibits a small rigid-body movement relative to the PEP/pyruvate domain whereas movements of the His domain and NBD1 are much more extensive. The analysis summarized in Table 2 substantiates the notion of quasi-rigid-body motions of PPDK domains. The rotation around the effective hinge axis of the CsPPDK His domain remains the same as that obtained from the automated DynDom analysis (111°), but the translational component along the rotation axis is reduced from -1.8 to -0.8 Å.

a CsPPDK1 was used as the reference molecule. The PEP/pyruvate domain of each structure was first superimposed on that of CsPPDK1, and pairwise analysis of each of the remaining domains was then carried out. The effective hinge axis is defined as an interdomain screw axis that passes within 3 Å of the CR atom of any of the interdomain residues involved in the interdomain motion (26).

FIGURE 6: Opening and closure of the nucleotide-binding domain. The two subdomains are colored as in Figure 1, and the short peptide linking them is highlighted in red. The hinge motion is around an axis perpendicular to this peptide linker.

FIGURE 8: AMP-PNP bound in the nucleotide-binding cleft. By analogy, His455 is positioned in line for accepting the -phosphate from ATP. By analogy to the SO4 ion, PO43- is positioned in line to accept the -phosphate of ATP. Domain color scheme is as in Figure 1. Atom colors: gray, carbon; blue, nitrogen; red, oxygen; yellow, sulfur; green, phosphorus.

FIGURE 7: Model of His455 positioned in line for accepting the phosphoryl group from PEP. The model was generated as described in the text and is consistent with the crystal structure of phosphorylated enzyme I (10). Domain color scheme is as in Figure 1. Atom colors: gray, carbon; blue, nitrogen; red, oxygen; yellow, sulfur; green, phosphorus.

The model exhibits only a few steric clashes, primarily between side chains, which are readily relieved by energy minimization. Adjustments were made to the side chains of Arg561, Arg617, Arg665, and Arg779, invariant in all PPDK sequences, to position their guanidinium groups in proximity with the phosphoryl group (Figure 7). Support for the interaction of three arginine residues, Arg561, Arg617, and

Arg665, is provided by the structure of CsPPDK in complex with phosphonopyruvate [cocrystallized with the His domain interacting with the nucleotide-binding domain (11)] and by the structure of MzPPDK soaked with PEP [the His domain remains in the nonproductive conformation (13)]. The conformation of the fourth arginine, Arg779, must change when the His domain adopts the phosphotransfer productive state; otherwise the Arg779 side chain penetrates the His domain. The catalytic properties of site-directed mutants substantiate the model; the replacement of Arg561 by a leucine or a lysine and Arg617 by a lysine resulted in enzymes that failed to catalyze the PEP partial reaction (11, 28). Moreover, all four arginine residues are invariant in both PPDK and enzyme I (8), and the structure of enzyme I in the phosphorylated state revealed the same arginine interactions (10). Similarly, the interaction of Asn768 with the phosphoryl group and that of the catalytic Cys831 with the pyruvyl C3 atom have their counterparts in enzyme I. SwiVeling Domain Mechanism. The two observed conformational states of CsPPDK support a molecular machine that couples the three partial chemical reactions with a swiveling motion of the His domain and with closure and opening of the nucleotide-binding cleft. A model of these coupled motions was generated by interpolating between two end

FIGURE 9: Proposed trajectory of the His domain and nucleotide-binding domain along the PPDK reaction pathway. Interpolations between the two end conformations were calculated as described in the text. Every tenth interpolation point is plotted in the figure. The PEP/ pyruvate binding domain is colored cyan.

states: one state corresponds to the structure of CsPPDK bound to Mg2+ and AMP-PNP, which represents the state prior to the nucleotide and Pi partial reactions (Figure 8; K.L., D.D.-M., and O.H., to be published), and the second state corresponds to the model of the enzyme prior to the PEP partial reaction that was described above (Figure 7). Rotation around the effective hinge axis as calculated by the DynDom program resulted in substantial clashes of the His domain along its trajectory because the axis was defined by considering only the two end states. To avoid these clashes, the effective hinge axis was tilted by 20°. A total of 90 interpolation points were generated and each was energyminimized to relieve minor clashes, yielding a trajectory that is illustrated in Figure 9. It should be emphasized that in generating the conformational transition model, the intention is to demonstrate the feasibility of the swiveling motion and not to imply that this is the true detailed reaction pathway. Moreover, the model is not expected to reproduce the catalytic rates because it ignores nonproductive fluctuations. The following conclusions are evident from the model. First, the His domain sways between the two extreme states as a rigid body while the fold integrity of the linkers is maintained, consistent with the observation that the linkers' association persists in the two experimental end conformational states of CsPPDK (Figure 1). Second, in principle the same end point may be reached by the 103° rotation or by the counter rotation corresponding to (360° - 103°). However, the counter-rotation causes entanglement of the two linkers and substantial domain-domain interpenetration. Hence, assuming that no gross unfolding takes place, only

one direction of the rotation is possible (anticlockwise, for a swivel from the nucleotide-binding domain to the PEP/ pyruvate-binding domain depicted in Figure 9). Along this

Swiveling Mechanism of PPDK trajectory, the His domain traverses two helices (highlighted in magenta in Figure 10), mediating an interaction between the nucleotide- and PEP/pyruvate-binding domains in CsPPDK1 and splaying apart when the nucleotide-binding domain adopts the open conformation observed in CsPPDK2. Each of these helices is appended to the core fold of its respective domain (viz. the ATP grasp and R/ barrel). In the nucleotide-bound state, the resulting continuous surface shields the high-energy phosphoHis455 from solvent throughout the conformational transition, thus preventing an undesired hydrolysis of the phosphoryl group. Finally, the time scale of the conformational change has not been yet determined but the turnover rate of the overall PPDK reaction sets an upper limit [25 s-1 (22)]. As the swivel motion is rather extensive, it would be interesting to know whether the conformational transition constitutes the rate-limiting step of the reaction and whether this transition is diffusion-controlled or driven by specific molecular interactions.
