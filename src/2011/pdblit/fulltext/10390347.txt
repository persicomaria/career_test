The Rad51 protein, a homologue of the bacterial RecA protein, is an essential factor for both meiotic and mitotic recombination. The N-terminal domain of the human Rad51 protein (HsRad51) directly interacts with DNA. Based on a yeast two-hybrid analysis, it has been reported that the N-terminal region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 protein binds Rad52; S. cerevisiae Rad51 and Rad52 both activate the homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions. Here, we show that the HsRad51 N-terminal region, which corresponds to the Rad52-binding region of ScRad51, does not exhibit strong binding to the human Rad52 protein (HsRad52). To investigate its function, the C-terminal region of HsRad51 was randomly mutagenized. Although this region includes the two segments corresponding to the putative DNA-binding sites of RecA, all seven of the mutants did not decrease, but instead slightly increased, the DNA binding. In contrast, we found that some of these HsRad51 mutations signi®cantly decreased the HsRad52 binding. Therefore, we conclude that these amino acid residues are required for the HsRad51 ÁHsRad52 binding. HsRad52, as well as S. cerevisiae Rad52, promoted homologous pairing between ssDNA and dsDNA, and higher homologous pairing activity was observed in the presence of both HsRad51 and HsRad52 than with either HsRad51 or HsRad52 alone. The HsRad51 F259V mutation, which strongly impaired the HsRad52 binding, decreased the homologous pairing in the presence of both HsRad51 and HsRad52, without affecting the homologous pairing by HsRad51 alone. This result suggests the importance of the HsRad51Á HsRad52 interaction in homologous pairing.

are introduced and processed through homologous recombination. In Escherichia coli, RecA, consisting of 352 amino acid residues, is an essential factor for the homologous recombination pathway. RecA catalyzes key steps, such as the homologous pairing and the strand exchange reactions. A eukaryotic RecA homologue, Rad51, which is highly conserved from yeast to human, has been discovered as a gene product in the RAD52 epistasis group (Aboussekhra et al., 1992; Basile et al., 1992; Shinohara et al., 1992, 1993; Bezzubova et al., 1993; Morita et al., 1993; Muris et al., 1993; Maeshima et al., 1995). A mutation in any of the RAD52 group of genes (RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, MRE11, and XRS2) causes severe defects in homologous recombination and in double-strand break repair in Saccharomyces cere# 1999 Academic Press

538 visiae (Petes et al., 1991). Rad51 is also indispensable in higher eukaryotes. For example, disruption of the RAD51 gene results in early embryonic lethality in mice (Lim & Hasty, 1996; Tsuzuki et al., 1996) and depletion of Rad51 in chicken DT40 cells causes the accumulation of spontaneous chromosome breaks (Sonoda et al., 1998). Rad51 promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions in vitro, thus indicating functional similarities between Rad51 and RecA (Sung, 1994; Sung & Robberson, 1995; Baumann et al.,

1996; Maeshima et al., 1996; Baumann & West, 1997; Namsaraev & Berg, 1997; Gupta et al., 1997; Sugiyama et al., 1997). In homologous pairing, RecA ®rst binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), forms a helical nucleoprotein ®lament, and then binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Shibata et al., 1979; McEntee et al., 1979). Like RecA, the human Rad51 protein (HsRad51) and the S. cerevisiae Rad51 protein (ScRad51) also form nucleoprotein ®laments with DNA, and the DNA is underwound in the ®lament (Ogawa et al., 1993a;

539 interactions. Indeed, the homologous pairing activity was higher when the reaction was performed in the presence of both Rad51 and Rad52 than in the presence of either Rad51 or Rad52 alone (Sung, 1997; Benson et al., 1998; Shinohara & Ogawa, 1998; New et al., 1998). Interestingly, neither HsRad51 nor Kluyveromyces lactis Rad51 complements the RAD51-de®cient phenotype in S. cerevisiae (Shinohara et al., 1993; Donovan et al., 1994), suggesting that the interactions of Rad51 with cofactors, including Rad52, are speciesspeci®c. In a yeast two-hybrid assay, the Rad52binding domain of ScRad51 was mapped to the N-terminal region, which is missing in RecA (Donovan et al., 1994). The two-hybrid assays also revealed that the Rad51-binding domains of ScRad52 and HsRad52 exist in their C-terminal regions, which lack sequence homology between them (Milne & Weaver, 1993; Shen et al., 1996). Recently, we determined the solution structure of the N-terminal domain of HsRad51 (19-83 amino acid residues), and showed that the domain directly binds DNA (Aihara et al., 1999). Here, we found that the N-terminal region of HsRad51 (1-114 amino acid residues) does not exhibit strong binding to HsRad52, although the corresponding N-terminal region (1-152 amino acid residues) of ScRad51 has been suggested to bind ScRad52 (Donovan et al., 1994). On the other hand, we could isolate mutants that exhibited a signi®cant decrease in HsRad52 binding from a pool of randomly generated C-terminal region mutants of HsRad51.

Benson et al., 1994). Despite these similarities with RecA, the strand exchange activity of HsRad51 is signi®cantly lower than that of RecA (Baumann & West, 1998; Gupta et al., 1998, 1999; Namsaraev & Berg, 1998). Rad52 has been found as another member of the RAD52 epistasis group in S. cerevisiae. Although the RAD52 gene has been identi®ed in yeast, mouse, chicken, and human, only the N-terminal half of the amino acid sequence of Rad52 is conserved in the proteins. The S. cerevisiae Rad52 protein (ScRad52) and the human Rad52 protein (HsRad52) bind ssDNA or dsDNA, and form multimeric ring structures (Shinohara et al., 1998; Van Dyck et al., 1998). Biochemical studies have revealed that both ScRad52 and HsRad52 possess annealing activity between complementary ssDNA molecules (Reddy et al., 1997; Shinoliara et al., 1998; Sugiyama et al., 1998), and ScRad52 promotes joint molecule formation between circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA (Ogawa et al., 1993b). HsRad52 preferentially binds the ends of ssDNA, protects the DNA from exonuclease attack, and promotes endto-end interactions of the DNA molecules (Van Dyck et al., 1999). These properties are remarkably similar to those of Ku, an essential factor for the initiation of non-homologous DNA end-joining (Critchlow & Jackson, 1998). This implies that HsRad52 acts in the initiation process of doublestrand break repair in homologous recombination. It has been reported that Rad52 directly binds Rad51 (Shinohara et al., 1992; Donovan et al., 1994; Shen et al., 1996). This suggests that the activities of Rad51 and Rad52 are coupled through their

The HsRad52 Binding Region of HsRad51

Results and Discussion
The N-terminal fragment of HsRad51 does not bind HsRad52 We examined whether HsRad52 binds the Nterminal fragment of HsRad51, HsRad51(1-114), which corresponds to Gly55-Gly172 of ScRad51. To analyze the HsRad52 binding of HsRad51, we employed a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. The His6-tagged HsRad51 (His6HsRad51) was incubated with the GST-fused HsRad52 (GST-HsRad52), and the complex was precipitated with glutathione Sepharose 4B beads. By this assay, the His6-HsRad51 bound to GSTHsRad52 was detected by Western blotting using the anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Figure l(a), lanes 2 and 5). Surprisingly, the His6-tagged HsRad51(1-114) does not bind GST-HsRad52 (Figure 1(a), lanes 3 and 6). Furthermore, NMR spectroscopic studies showed that HsRad51(1-114) does not interact with HsRad52, even at higher concentrations. As shown in Figure 1(b), there are few differences, if any, between the presence (red contours) and the absence (black contours) of HsRad52 in the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra. Therefore, we conclude that the N-terminal region of HsRad51 is not the strong binding site for HsRad52, although we cannot exclude the possibility of cooperativity between the N-terminal and core regions of HsRad51 in HsRad52 binding. These results suggest that the Rad52 binding mechanism is not well conserved between HsRad51 and ScRad51. It should be noted here that the amino acid sequence of the ScRad51-binding region of ScRad52 (Milne & Weaver, 1993) is not homologous to that of the corresponding part of HsRad52 (Shen et al., 1996).

ssDNA binding by the HsRad51 mutants On the other hand, this N-terminal fragment of HsRad51 can bind DNA (Aihara et al., 1999), which led us to test the role of the HsRad51 Cterminal region, including two peptide segments corresponding to the putative DNA binding sites of RecA (Figure 2). We performed the region-speci®ed PCR random mutagenesis (Ikeda et al., 1992) in the C-terminal region (236-299 residues) of HsRad51, and obtained seven HsRad51 mutants, G236S, F259V, V269G, V273M, F279L, I287S, and R299Q, within this region (Figure 2). These HsRad51 mutants were puri®ed and were tested for ssDNA binding (Figure 3). The Gly236, Val269, Val273, and Phe279 mutations are located in the segments that correspond to the putative DNAbinding sites of RecA (Figure 2). First, the wildtype HsRad51 was shown to bind ssDNA (50mers); the complex was detectable by non-denaturing 12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure 4(a) and (b), lanes 2-4). None of the seven

(a) The HsRad51 protein eluted from the Ni-column (lane 2, ProBond) and the hydroxyapatite column (lane 1) was analyzed by SDS-12 % PAGE and was visualized by Coomassic blue staining. The HsRad51 eluted from the hydroxyapatite column (lane 1) does not include the His6-tag, and migrates faster than that from the Ni-column (lane 2). Lane 3 contains the molecular mass markers. (b) Puri®ed HsRad51 mutants eluted from the hydroxyapatite column were analyzed by SDS-12 % PAGE and were visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Lane 1 contains the molecular mass markers and lane 2 is the HsRad51 protein (0.75 mg). Lanes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are the G236S (0.50 mg), F259V (0.40 mg), V269G (0.65 mg), V273M (0.55 mg), F279L (0.55 mg), I287S (0.40 mg), and R299Q (0.50 mg) mutants, respectively. The HsRad51 protein and the HsRad51 mutants presented in (b) do not include the His6-tag.

HsRad51 mutations tested here showed decreased levels of ssDNA binding. Except for the V273M mutation, six mutants exhibited slightly enhanced levels of ssDNA binding (Figure 4). These amino acid residues of HsRad51 might be involved in the negative regulation of ssDNA binding. For

Complexes of HsRad51 and ssDNA were separated by nondenaturing 12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (a) Lane 1 is a negative control reaction without HsRad51, and lanes 2-4 are positive control reactions with the wild-type HsRad51. Lanes 5-7 are the F259V mutant, and lanes 8-10 are the V273M mutant. The concentrations of the wild-type HsRad51 and the HsRad51 mutants are 100 nM (lanes 2, 5, and 8), 300 nM (lanes 3, 6, and 9), and 600 nM (lanes 4, 7, and 10).

example, Phe279 in HsRad51, which when mutated to Leu enhanced the DNA binding, corresponds to a phenylalanine residue (Phe203) in RecA (Figure 2(a)). The F203W mutant of RecA has slightly higher af®nities for DNA than the wildtype RecA (Maraboeuf et al., 1995). It is remarkable that similar effects on the ssDNA binding are observed for all of the seven mutations tested here for HsRad51. dsDNA binding by the HsRad51 mutants Next, the dsDNA binding was analyzed for these mutants of HsRad51. Linearized plasmid DNA (form III, 3216 bp) was used as the substrate

for the binding assay. Complexes of HsRad51 and dsDNA were analyzed, based on the reduced mobilities of the DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis (Baumann et al., 1996). The wild-type HsRad51 was con®rmed to bind dsDNA (Figure 5(a)). The migration distance of the dsDNA depended on the concentration of HsRad51 (Figure 5(a)), which re¯ects the number of HsRad51 proteins bound to the dsDNA molecule. On the other hand, all of the HsRad51 mutants tested here were able to bind dsDNA, but the migration distances of the complexes on the agarose gel were different (Figure 5(b)). The migration distances of the dsDNA complexes of the G236S, F259V, V269G,

Figure 5. Binding of the HsRad51 mutants to dsDNA. Linear dsDNA (18 mM, 3216 bp) was incubated with either HsRad51 or the HsRad51 mutants. Complexes of HsRad51 and dsDNA were separated by 0.8 % (panel A) and 1 % (panel B) agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5X TBE. (a) Lane 1 is a control reaction without HsRad51, and lanes 2-4 are reactions with the wild-type HsRad51. The concentrations of HsRad51 are 1 mM (lane 2), 3 mM (lane 3), and 6 mM (lane 4). (b) The HsRad51 or the HsRad51 mutants (3 mM) were incubated with linear dsDNA. Lane 1 is a negative control reaction without HsRad51, and lane 2 is a positive control reaction with the wild-type HsRad51. Lanes 3-9 indicate reactions with the G236S, F259V, V269G, V273M, F279L, I287S, and R299Q mutants, respectively. Bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

F279L, and I287S mutants were shorter than that of the wild-type complex. Particularly, the F259V ÁdsDNA complex showed the slowest mobility (Figure 5(b), lane 4). Therefore, the dsDNA binding abilities of these mutants are detectably higher than that of the wild-type HsRad51. In contrast, the dsDNA complexes of the V273M and R299Q mutants migrated to the same distance as that of the wild-type complex (Figure 5(b), lanes 6 and 9, respectively). As all of the HsRad51 mutants tested here retain both the ssDNA binding and dsDNA binding abilities, we could not show the direct binding of DNA in the C-terminal region of HsRad51. HsRad52 binding by the HsRad51 mutants As described above, the HsRad51 N-terminal region, HsRad51(1-114), which corresponds to the Rad52-binding region of ScRad51, did not exhibit strong binding to HsRad52. Surprisingly, we found that the HsRad51 mutants, F259V and R299Q, were signi®cantly defective (Figure 6(a), lanes 13 and 18, and (b)), and the V273M, F279L, and I287S

mutants were moderately defective (Figure 6(a), lanes 15, 16, and 17, and (b)) in binding to HsRad52. The G236S and V269G mutations do not affect either the DNA binding abilities or the HsRad52 binding abilities (Figure 6(a), lanes 12 and 14, and (b)). Therefore, the ®ve amino acid residues, Phe259, Val273, Phe279, Ile287, and Arg299, are important for the HsRad52 binding. These results suggest that the Rad52 binding mechanisms of Rad51 are not exactly conserved between the yeast and human proteins. We cannot exclude the possibility that the mutations indirectly affect the HsRad52 binding site in HsRad51. When the amino acid sequence of HsRad51 is superimposed on the crystal structure of RecA (Story et al., 1992), Phe259 of HsRad51 is located on the molecular surface of the RecA monomer, and is exposed to the solvent outside of the RecA ®lament (Figure 7). The Phe259 residue, which is strongly required for the HsRad52 binding, is a possible candidate for a direct HsRad52-binding site of HsRad51. In contrast, Arg299 of HsRad51 is located near the interface of the monomer in the RecA ®lament (Figure 7). The R299Q mutation might cause a con-

The proteins bound to GST-HsRad52 were precipitated and were analyzed by Western blotting. (a) The HsRad51 mutants and the wild-type HsRad51 added to the reactions were detected by Western blotting (lanes 1-9), and the HsRad51 mutants and the wild-type HsRad51 bound to HsRad52 were detected by Western blotting (lanes 10-18). (b) Quanti®cations of the HsRad51 mutants bound to HsRad52 relative to the wild-type HsRad51. The average and SD values are presented.

formational change of the HsRad51 ®lament that impairs the HsRad52 binding. Joint molecule formation by the HsRad51 mutants, F259V and R299Q To assess the effects of the F259V and R299Q mutations, which signi®cantly inhibit HsRad52 binding of HsRad51, on the recombination reaction, we tested the abilities of F259V and R299Q to form joint molecules between homologous ssDNA and dsDNA. The D-loop assay, which is the standard assay for detecting the homologous pairing activity of RecA, was employed (Shibata et al., 1979). The 32P-labeled ssDNA and superhelical dsDNA (form I DNA) were used as substrates. The D-loops, in which the labeled ssDNA is incorporated into form I DNA in its homologous site, were analyzed by 0.8 % agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 8, HsRad51 promoted D-loop formation between homologous ssDNA and dsDNA (lanes 2-4), but not between heterologous ssDNA and dsDNA (lane 5). The F259V mutant also promoted D-loop formation with a slightly reduced rate, suggesting that the F259V mutation did not strongly affect the function and structure of HsRad51 (Figure 8 lanes 6-8 and Table 1). In con-

trast, the R299Q mutant was signi®cantly defective in D-loop formation (Figure 8 lanes 10-12 and Table 1). This suggests that the R299Q mutation affects the ®lament conformation, which allows DNA binding, but impairs homologous pairing of HsRad51. It has been reported that homologous pairing is enhanced when HsRad52 is incubated with ssDNA before the addition HsRad51 and linear dsDNA (Benson et al., 1998). Accordingly, we tested the homologous pairing in the presence of both HsRad51 and HsRad52 by a D-loop formation assay, in order to examine the effect of the F259V mutation on the HsRad51 ÁHsRad52 interaction in the homologous pairing. We found that HsRad52 itself promotes homologous pairing between ssDNA fragments and form I DNA (Figure 9). This result is consistent with the previous observation by Ogawa et al. (1993b) that ScRad52 promotes homologous pairing in vitro. The homologous pairing activity of HsRad52 is apparently stronger than that of HsRad51 (Table 1). More homologous pairing was observed in the presence of both HsRad51 and HsRad52 than in the presence of either one of them. Finally, we showed that the F259V mutation of HsRad51 decreased the homologous pairing by the two proteins (Table 1). These results suggest

The HsRad52 Binding Region of HsRad51 fusion protein with GST. All of the genes cloned in this study were sequenced. Mutagenesis of HsRad51 Region-speci®ed PCR mutagenesis (Ikeda et al., 1992) was performed to introduce random base substitutions in the human RAD51 gene. The Cterminal region of the human RAD51 gene was ampli®ed by PCR in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HG (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 0.1 % (v/v) 100 mM dNTPs TritonX-100, 2.5 mM MgCl2, (dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP), 300 mM 2H deoxyinosine 5H -triphosphate (dITP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 20 pmol of primers, and plasmid DNA including the human RAD51 gene as a template. The nucleotide sequences of the primers used for PCR were 5H CGTCTGCTGGCAGTGGCTGAGCGTTATGGTCTCTCTGGC3H and 5H TTCCCGGGTCAGTH CTTTGGCATCTCCCAC3 . These primers gave rise to 520-nt DNA fragments encoding the region of amino acid residues 170-339 of HsRad51 in the PCR reaction. The reaction cycles, 94  C for one minute, 60  C for one minute, and 72  C for one minute, were repeated 30 times with ®ve units of recombinant taq polymerase (Toyobo). DNA fragments ampli®ed by Taq polymerase in the presence of dITP were puri®ed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and were ligated to the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Base substitutions introduced by PCR were identi®ed by DNA sequencing. The DNA fragments with a single amino acid substitution were inserted into the wild-type RAD51 gene at the XhoI or AccI sites, which are located within the gene. Proteins The HsRad51 overexpression plasmid, pET-HsRad51, was introduced into E. coli JM109(DE3) cells with the plasmid containing the genes for E. coli tRNAArg3 and tRNAArg4, which recognize the CGG and AGA/AGG codons, respectively. The cells with the HsRad51 and tRNA expression systems were grown in two liters of LB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and 34 mg/ml chloramphenicol at 30  C for eight hours, and then 1 mM isopropyl b-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce HsRad51 expression. HsRad51 was produced for 12 hours at 30  C in the presence of IPTG, and the cells

that the HsRad51Á HsRad52 interaction, which is impaired by the F259V mutation, may be important for both HsRad51 and HsRad52 to work properly together. This HsRad51 mutation, F259V, will be useful in further analyses of the molecular mechanism of homologous recombination by factors including HsRad51 and HsRad52.

Materials and Methods
Construction of expression systems for HsRad51 and HsRad52 The human RAD51 gene was cloned from human testis cDNA (Marathon-Ready cDNA, Clontech) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The codon usages of the human and E. coli genes are different, and tRNAs recognizing the AGA, AGG, and CGG codons of arginine are extremely rare in E. coli. Five rare arginine codons, which were located in the 229th, 299th, 303rd, 306th, and 310th codons, were replaced by CGT in the human RAD51 gene by site-directed mutagenesis. The Rad51 gene was ligated into the NdeI site of the pET15b vector (Novagen) to express these genes in E. coli JM109(DE3) cells (recAÀ). The HsRad51 proteins were expressed as His6-tagged proteins containing the peptide Met-GlySer-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Ser-Ser-Gly-Leu-Val-ProArg-Gly-Ser-His at their N termini (the thrombin protease recognition sequence is underlined, and the three amino acid residues, Gly-Ser-His that remained at the N termini of the proteins after thrombin digestion are indicated in bold). The RAD52 gene was cloned from human ovary cDNA (Marathon-Ready cDNA, Clontech) by PCR, and was ligated into the BamHI site of the pGEX6P-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Figure 8. Joint molecule formation by the F259V and R299Q mutants. The 32P-labeled ssDNA (0.15 mM) was incubated with HsRad51 at 37  C for ten minutes, and the reaction was started by the addition of homologous superhelical dsDNA (10 mM). After an incubation at 37  C for ten minutes, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 % of SDS, and the protein was removed by an incubation with 0.3 mg/ml Proteinase K at 37  C for 15 minutes. The joint molecules (D-loops) formed were analyzed by 0.8 % agarose gel electrophoresis. The protein concentrations were 0.25 mM (lanes 2, 6, and 10), 0.5 mM (lanes 3, 7, and 11), and 1 mM (lanes 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 13), respectively. Lane 1 is a negative control reaction without HsRad51. Lanes 2-5 are the wild-type HsRad51, lanes 6-9 are the F259V mutant, and lanes 10-13 are the R299Q mutant, respectively. Lanes 5, 9, and 13 are negative controls with heterologous dsDNA. were harvested. The cells producing HsRad51 were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer containing 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.9) and 0.5 M NaCl, and were disrupted by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 30,000 g, and the supernatant was incubated with 4 ml of Ni-resin (ProBond, Invitrogen) for one hour at 4  C. The resin was then washed with 150 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 0.5 M NaCl. Subsequently, the resin was washed with 150 ml of buffer containing 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.9) and 5 mM imidazole, and was packed into a column. The HsRad51 protein was eluted by a gradient of imidazole from 5 mM to 400 mM in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The HsRad51 eluted from the Ni-column was digested with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1 unit per mg, of protein) to remove the His6-tag. Digestion of the His6-tag was monitored by SDS-12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure 3), and the sample was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (BioRad) previously equilibrated with buffer containing 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and 10 (v/v) glycerol. The HsRad51 protein was eluted by a gradient of potassium phosphate from 100 mM to 800 mM, and was dialyzed against a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 % glycerol. The puri®ed HsRad51 protein was concentrated, and its concentration was determined by the BioRad protein assay kit (BioRad) using bovine serum albumen (BSA) as the standard protein. The HsRad51 mutants were puri®ed by the same method as that used for the wild-type HsRad51. The mutations are as follows: Gly236 to Ser (G236S), Phe259 to Val (F259V), Val269 to Gly (V269G), Val273 to Met (V273M), Phe279 to Leu (F279L), Ile287 to Ser (I287S), and Arg299 to Gln (R299Q) (Figure 2). The concentrations of the HsRad51 mutants were determined by the BioRad protein assay kit (BioRad) using BSA and puri®ed HsRad51 as standard proteins, and the integrity of the mutant proteins was monitored by SDS-12 % PAGE (Figure 3). HsRad52 was expressed as a GST-fusion protein (GST-HsRad52) in E. coli JM109(DE3) cells in the presence of the tRNAArg and tRNAArg expression systems. 3 4

The cells (10 g) were disrupted by sonication in 30 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),300 mM KCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol, and the lysate was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 30,000 g. The supernatant was incubated with 2 ml of glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for one hour at 4  C, and then the beads were washed with 150 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The GST-HsRad52 protein was eluted with 30 ml of elution buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 16 mM glutathione, and 10 % glycerol. The GSTHsRad52 protein eluted from the glutathione Sepharose 4B was concentrated, and the elution buffer of the sample was exchanged with buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 % glycerol by a Centriprep 30 cartridge (Amicon). The concentration of the GST-HsRad52 protein was determined by a BioRad protein assay kit (BioRad) using BSA as the standard protein.

The HsRad52 Binding Region of HsRad51 Single-stranded DNA binding assay A 32P-labeled single-stranded 50-mer oligonucleotide (300 nM) was mixed with HsRad51 or the HsRad51 mutants in 10 ml of standard reaction buffer, containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml BSA, 12 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 15 mM MgCl2, and 3 % (v/v) glycerol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37  C for ten minutes, and were analyzed by nondenaturing 12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer. The samples were electrophoresed for four hours at 6 V/cm, and the intensities of the bands were quantitated with a BAS-2500 image analyzer (Fuji). Double-stranded DNA binding assay Linearized pGsat4 DNA (18 mM; 3216 bp) was mixed with HsRad51 or the HsRad51 mutants in 10 ml of the standard reaction buffer, containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml BSA, 12 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 15 mM MgCl2, and 6 % (v/v) (glycerol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37  C for ten minutes, and were analyzed by 0.8 % or 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5 Â TBE buffer. The samples were electrophoresed for two or four hours at 3 V/cm, and the bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Assay for joint molecule formation of ssDNA and dsDNA (D-loop formation) A 32P-labeled single-stranded 50-mer oligonucleotide (ssDNA) was incubated with HsRad51 in 10 ml of standard reaction buffer containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml BSA, 12 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 1 mM MgCl2. In the case of HsRad52, ssDNA was incubated in the buffer containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mM MgCl2. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37  C for ®ve minutes, and the reaction was started by the addition of 14 mM MgCl2 and pGsat4 form I DNA (10 mM). After incubation at 37  C for ten minutes, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 % (w/v) SDS, and the proteins were removed from the DNA by treatment with proteinase K (300 mg/ml), followed by an incubation at 37  C for 15 minutes. The joint molecules (D-loops) were separated from the unreacted DNA substrates by 0.8 % agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5ÂTBE buffer. The amounts of labeled ssDNA fragments incorporated into D-loops were quanti®ed with a Fuji BAS2500 image analyzer.

DNA substrates An HPLC-puri®ed oligonucleotide 50 mer (5H ATTTCATGCTAGACAGAAGAATTCTCAGTAACTTCTTTGTGCTGTGTGTA3H ) for DNA binding assays was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. This sequence is derived from a clone of human a-satellite DNA. The 5H ends of the oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [g-32P]ATP. A 198 bp fragment of the human a-satellite sequence was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The plasmid DNA (pGsat4; 3216 bp) containing the human a-satellite sequence was puri®ed by a Qiagen plasmid puri®cation kit (QIAGEN), and was linearized by NheI digestion. DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides.

GST pull-down assays GST-HsRad52 (1 mg) was incubated with 70 ng of His6-tagged HsRad51 (His6-HsRad51) in 150 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05 % Triton X100 and 10 ml of glutathione Sepharose 4B beads suspended in PBS, for one hour at 4  C. After the reaction, the beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS, and the proteins bound to the beads were subjected to SDS-12 % PAGE. The His6-HsRad51 that interacted with GST-HsRad52 was detected by Western blotting with an anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Clontech), and the blots probed with the antibody were developed using the ECL immunodetection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensities of the detected bands were quantitated with a BioImage densitometer (MilliGen).

NMR measurements NMR spectra were acquired at 20  C on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer. The uniformly 15N-labeled HsRad51(1-114) was expressed in E. coli strain JM109(DE3), and was puri®ed as described (Aihara et al., 1999). In the titration experiments, the 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded with 0.1 mM of protein in buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.02 % NaN3.
