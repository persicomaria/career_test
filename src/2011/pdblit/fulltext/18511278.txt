11b-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1) is a key enzyme that acts as an NADPH-dependent reductase capable of converting inactive 11b glucocorticoids such as cortisone into their active form, (e.g., cortisol), in specific tissues, such as liver, adipose, and brain tissues. Therefore, 11b-HSD1 regulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid levels.1­4 Conversely, 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11b-HSD2), a structurally related isoenzyme of 11b-HSD1, catalyzes the conversion of cortisol to cortisone utilizing NAD as a cofactor. 11b-HSD2 is expressed in cells that contain the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and protects the MR by converting cortisol to the inactive form, cortisone.5 Selective inhibition of 11b-HSD1 may be a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and has attracted significant attention from the pharmaceutical research community.6­13 We previously reported arylsulfonylpiperazines as potent inhibitors of 11b-HSD1 in in vitro assays.14,15 Although compound 1 (Fig. 1) exhibited excellent in vitro inhibition of human and mouse 11b-HSD1, it had poor water solubility and oral bioavailability in rats. In this communication, we described our optimization efforts on structural modifications of 1 to improve the potency

These efforts led us to the discovery of potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitors showing excellent efficacy in a cynomolgus monkey ex vivo enzyme inhibition model. Compounds were synthesized via the routes outlined in Schemes 1­5.16 Compounds 2­8, 18­21, and 30, were prepared as shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 2­8 were obtained simply by reaction of tert-butylbenzenesulfonyl chloride and N-alkylpiperazine 31, which was synthesized by either direct nucleophilic displacement between the alkyl halide and (R)-(À)-2-methylpiperazine or reductive amination of (R)-(À)-2-methylpiperazine with the appropriate aldehyde. Treatment of 31 with 4-acetylbenzenesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane provided the

As shown in Scheme 2, compounds 9­15 were prepared from methyl ketone 32 using standard functional group transformations. Intermediate 32 was obtained by treatment of 4-acetylbenzenesulfonyl chloride with piperazine 31, which was derived from direct nucleophilic displacement between 4-pyridylethyl chloride and (R)-(À)-2-methylpiperazine. Addition of methyl lithium to 32 formed alcohol 9, which was subsequentially fluorinated with DAST in dichloromethane at À78 °C to afford 10. Treatment with TMS-CF3 converted 32 to trifluoromethylcarbinol 11, which was fluorinated with DAST to afford 12. Reduction of 32 with NaBH4 provided 13, which was converted to 14 with excess DAST at room temperature. In a similar fashion, compound 15 was prepared by treating 32 with DAST. The synthetic route for preparing compounds 16­17 is shown in Scheme 3. Treatment of 31 with sulfonyl chloride 33 in dichloromethane gave the ester, which was then reduced with DIBAL-H to yield the alcohol 16. Oxidation of the primary alcohol in 16, followed by reductive amination of the resulting aldehyde with morpholine gave 17.

D. Sun et al. / Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 19 (2009) 1522­1527 Table 1 Inhibition of 11b-HSD1 by selected analogs: N-alkylation

The synthesis of compounds 22­27 is depicted in Scheme 4. Commercially available ester 34 was alkylated with appropriate dibromide to give 35. Reduction of 35 with DIBAl-H, followed by chlorination of the primary alcohol with thionyl chloride produced chloride 36, which was then coupled with (R)-(À)-2-methylpiperazine to yield 37. Finally, preparations of compounds 22­27 were achieved by treatment of 37 with 4-acetylbenzenesulfonyl chloride, followed by trifluoromethylation with TMS-CF3. In Scheme 5, reduction of the appropriate ester 38 with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminohydride formed the corresponding alcohol, which was then oxidized to the aldehyde 39 with Dess­Martin periodinane. Reductive amination of 39 with (R)-(À)-2-methylpiperazine gave the substituted piperazine 40, which was successively treated with 4-acetylbenzenesulfonyl chloride and trifluoromethylation with TMS-CF3 to provide the ester 41. Hydrolysis of 41 with lithium hydroxide gave the acid, which was treated with thionyl chloride and then ammonia to yield 28 or 29, respectively. Separation of the diastereoisomers of 28 via preparative chiral HPLC (Chiralpak AD) afforded optically pure (S)-28 and (R)-28. Compounds were evaluated for the inhibition of human and mouse 11b-HSD1 enzymes, as well as in cell-based assays. 11bHSD1 enzyme activity was determined by measuring the conversion of [3H]-cortisone to [3H]-cortisol. Product [3H]-cortisol, captured by an anti-cortisol monoclonal antibody conjugated to scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads, was quantified with a microscintillation plate reader. Biochemical enzyme assays were performed with Baculovirus-produced recombinant full-length human 11b-HSD1 as the enzyme source and NADPH as cofactor (hHSD1 IC50). Cell-based enzyme assays (h-293 IC50) utilized HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human full-length 11b-HSD1 as the enzyme source without supplementation of NADPH. IC50 values for enzyme inhibition were calculated with a dose­response curve fitting algorithm with at least duplicate sets of samples. Our initial optimization efforts began with the goal of improving the solubility of 1 by incorporating a carbon spacer between the aryl group and the piperazine ring. As shown in Table 1, the 4-pyridyl compounds (3, 4, 5, and 6), which have a carbon based spacer, showed significant improvement in water solubility compared to 1 and 2. Additionally, two or three-carbon spacers (4 and 5) and methyl substitution at the a-position of the 4-pyridyl group (6) resulted in potency similar to 2. However, phenyl substitution at the a-position (7) notably reduced potency. The incorporation of an additional fused benzene ring (8) brought a slight decrease in potency as compared to 3. These data suggested that both spacer length and substitution at the a-position were important for 11b-HSD1 inhibitory activity. Based on metabolic liabilities we observed in our previous efforts,14 i.e., in vitro oxidation of the tert-butyl group, we next turned our attention to modification of the substitution at the 4position of the sulfonamide phenyl ring. Table 2 shows the effects of varying substituents at the 4-position of 4. It was found that the trifluoromethylcarbinol moiety (11) produced approximately a threefold improvement in biochemical and cellular potency over the corresponding tert-butyl analog 4, along with even more significant improvement in metabolic stability. No in vitro metabolite derived from the trifluoromethylcarbinol moiety was observed in metabolite identification studies. With the discovery of the improved potency and metabolic stability imparted by the trifluoromethylcarbinol group as a substituent at the 4-position of the sulfonamide phenyl ring, we then returned to investigate further modifications of the N-alkyl substituents in 11. The data in Table 3 indicated that 3-pyridyl derivative 18 was as potent as 11, while the corresponding 2-pyridyl analog 19 exhibited decreased potency. Interestingly, the incorporation of fluorines to the a-position (20, 21) brought a slight increase of

biochemical potency, but a decrease in cellular potency and in vitro metabolic stability as compared to 11 and 18, respectively. As N-dealkylation was observed as a significant metabolic liability in vitro, further investigation was carried out to introduce a cycloalkyl ring in the a-position of 11 and 18. As indicated in Table 4, addition of a cycloalkyl ring gave a significant increase in biochemical potency with cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, and cyclopentyl substituents (examples 22­27, h-HSD1 IC50 < 1 nM), while cellular potency was mostly maintained relative to 11 and 18. Furthermore, compound 22 also displayed significant improvement in in vitro metabolic stability over 11 (80% vs 59% remaining in rat liver S9 @ 60 min). The rat PK profile of 22 featured good oral bioavailability and a moderate clearance (F = 60%; CL = 2.1 L/h/kg). However, compound 22 also exhibited strong in vitro inhibitory activity against hERG and CYP-3A4 (Table 5). In order to diminish the hERG and CYP-3A4 liability, alignment of pyridine analog 22 to a hERG pharmacophore model18 was used to design modifications aimed at reducing hERG potency. Potent hERG blockers such as 22 aligned to the pharmacophore by matching two hydrophobic features and the ionizable nitrogen (Fig. 2) present in the inhibitors. This alignment suggested potential modifications to reduce the hERG liability. Replacement of the pyridine moiety, which matches one of the hydrophobic features, with polar groups were explored. Thus, compound 28 with an amide group replacing the pyridyl ring, was a much weaker hERG blocker than 22 (hERG IC50 22; 0.44 lM ? 28; >100 lM, Table 5). Additional modifications were made by adding hydrogen bond donor groups to the terminal aromatic ring targeting the so-called anti-hERG feature. Compound 30 with an amide at the para-position of phenyl ring, was a weak hERG blocker with an IC50 of 6.4 lM. Figure 2

(S)-28, a highly potent (hHSD1 IC50 = 0.7 nM) inhibitor of 11bHSD1with excellent selectivity (hHSD2 IC50 > 100 lM) and no hERG and CYP liabilities (Table 6). Compound (S)-28 also exhibited significant improvements in water solubility and oral bioavailability in rats compared to 1 (Table 7). In addition to the excellent potency and pharmacokinetic profile of compound (S)-28, this molecule had suitable activity against cynomologous monkey 11b-HSD1 enzyme (IC50 = 6 nM) and was selected for further evaluation in our cynomolgus monkey ex vivo pharmacodynamic model. In this study, cynomolgus monkeys were dosed orally with 0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg of inhibitor (S)-28. At 2 h post-dose, mesenteric fat tissues were collected. Following 1 h incubation of these tissues in media containing [3H]-cortisone, 11b-HSD1 activity was measured through detection of tritiated cortisol levels using a scintillation proximity assay. Relative to controls, all dose groups showed a decrease in [3H]-cortisol production in mesenteric fat (Fig. 3), corresponding to an ED50 in

Compound exposure levels in this experiment were measured to be considerably higher in adipose than in plasma (Table 8), demonstrating that inhibitor (S)-28 effectively distributed to the target tissue.

crystal structure of compound (S)-28 with human 11b-HSD1 containing NADP cofactor reveals that the inhibitor binds to the substrate site in a V-shape with its trifluoromethylcarbinol group pointing towards the cofactor NADP+ side. The central sulfonyl group makes a hydrogen bond from one of its oxygen atoms to the backbone amide of Ala172, as well as VDW contacts with Ser170 in the catalytic site. In summary, significant improvement in both potency and PK property was achieved by a series of modifications starting from 1. Modification of the sulfonamide aryl substitution led to the discovery of the trifluoromethylcarbinol group, resulting in a threefold improvement in biochemical and cellular potency over the corresponding tert-butyl analog. Further modifications to the Naryl substituents led to the discovery of a 1, 1-cyclopropyl spacer, producing a fourfold improvement in biochemical potency over the corresponding methylene compound. The hERG pharmacophore model was successfully used to reduce hERG potency. In addition, combination of the features resulted in a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable compound (S)-28, which demonstrated 11b-HSD1 inhibition in a cynomolgus monkey ex vivo model. Finally, X-ray co-crystallographic data of (S)-28 with 11b-HSD1 revealed the key interactions for the inhibitor binding. References and notes

All compounds gave satisfactory 1H NMR, HPLC, and MS data in full agreement with their proposed structures and purity (>95%) was determined by HPLC analysis. 17. Prakash, K. G. S.; Yudin, A. K. Chem. Rev. 1997, 97, 757. 18. hERG modeling method: A Unity hERG pharmacophore, developed from literature data,19 was used to align this analog series. The model consists of three hydrophobic (aliphatic as well as aromatic) groups and ionizable nitrogen. This pharmacophore is similar to that published by Cavalli et al.20 In addition, we developed an anti-hERG feature consisted of a hydrogen bond donor of specific location relative to the hERG `favorable' features. The location of the anti-hERG feature was derived from automatic molecular alignment of an internal hERG dataset. In this data, potent hERG blockers where modified with various types of hydrogen bond donors resulting in significant reduction of hERG binding and patch clamp IC50. A Unity hydrogen bond donor feature was build based on this alignment and combined with the hERG pharmacophore. 19. Sybyl, version 7.0; Tripos, Inc.: St. Louis, MO, 2003. 20.
