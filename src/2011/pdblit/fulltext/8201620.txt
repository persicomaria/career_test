A high molecular weight form of nerve growth factor (7 S NGF) has been crystallized in two crystal forms from polyethylene glycol 4000 by the vapour diffusion technique. The orthorhombic form A belongs to the space group P2,2,2, and has cell dimensions of a = 95.6, b = 96.5 and c = 147-O A. With synchrotron X-ray radiation, these crystals diffract to 2.8 A resolution. They contain an intact 7 S NGF complex in the asymmetric unit. The tetragonal form B, which grows at similar conditions to the A form, belongs to the space group P4,2,2 (or P4,2,2) with unit cell dimensions of a = 97.4, b = 97.4 and c = 308.3 A. These crystals diffract to 3.6 A resolution and contain one 7 S complex per asymmetric unit. Native X-ray data have been collected to 3.3 A for the A form and to 5.0 A for the H form, both using synchrotron radiation. Keywords: nerve growth factor; crystallization; serine proteinase

Nerve growth factor regulates the survival and neurite outgrowth of a variety of neuronal populations in both the peripheral and the central nervous system (Levi-Montalcini, 1987; Maisonpierre et al., 1990). It also plays a key role throughout adulthood in controlling neuronal repair capabilities to chemical and mechanical insult. The neurotrophic activity resides in the 118 amino acid fi-NGF molecule (Angeletti & Bradshaw, 1971). This associates as a dimer that is the biologically relevant form of NGF released by the target tissues of sensory and sympathetic neurons (Thoenen et al., 1985). The slgnalling properties of /3-NGF are a result of highaffinity interaction with a specific cell surface receptor that subsequently activates a secondary messenger cascade inside the neuron (Sutter et al., 1979). fl-NGF undergoes another high affinity proteinprot#ein interaction with two members of the kallikrein family of serine proteinases, termed c1 and y-KGF, to form a stable oligomeric complex (Varon et al.. 1967). The best characterized high molecular weight' complex is the 7 S NGF found in murine submandibular glands. A similar complex may also bc present in other tissue sources of NGF (Goldstein et al., 1979; Harper et aZ., 1982). The exact physiological role of this complex is not yet fully understood, though a role in fi-NGF biosynthesis and storage is likely (Darling et al., 1983; Edwards et al., 1988). The stoichiometry of the complex is two

c(-NGF subunits of molecular mass 26,900, one /I-NGF dimer of 26,500, two y-NGF subunits of 26,500 and one or two zinc ions (Pattison & Dunn, 1975). The observed molecular mass of 7 S NGF in this tissue source is 130,000 as estima.ted from a variety of sedimentation techniques (Server & Shooter, 1977). This agrees well with the calculated molecular mass from the amino acid sequences of each subunit (Angeletti & Bradshaw, 1971; Thomas et al., 1981a; Isackson et al., 1984). /?-NGF has been crystallized several years ago in a form suitable for X-ray analysis (Wlodawer et al., 1975). An initial chain tracing for /?-NGF has recently been completed at 3.0 A (1 A = 91 nm) resolution (N. Q. McDonald, R. Lapatto, J. M. Murray-Rust, J. Gunning, A. Wlodawer & T. 1,. Blundell, unpublished results). Part of this work has involved isolating the 7 S complex that protects the fi-NGF from degradation by various submandibular gland proteinases during purification (Mobley et al., 1976). This gives a more homogeneous /%NGF and in addition provides large quantities of the 7 S complex for crystallization trials. Of the do and y-NGF subunits, only the y-NGF maintains a detectable esteropeptidase activity characteristic of serine proteinases (Thomas & Bradshaw, 1981). The c+NGF has no serine proteinase activity and lacks the amino-terminal pro-signal sequence required by serine proteinase zymogens to be cleaved into an active serine proteinase (Isackson 595

1987). The formation of the 7 S complex competitively inhibits the receptor binding affinity of the B subunit (Stach & Shooter, 1980; HarrisWarrick et al., 1980; Woodruff & Neet, 1986). The y-NGF esteropeptidase activity is also inhibited when bound to the a and fl-NGF in 7 S NGF. The stability of the 7 S complex under physiological conditions is very high (K, = 10-l' M). The associations of an a2/12 complex at pH 55 and yzfiz at pH %5 give an overall pH stability profile of between 5.0 and 90 (Silverman & Bradshaw, 1982). The stability of the complex can be enhanced by the addition of micromolar zinc concentrations to give an apparent KD for the complex of 2 x 10-l' M (Bothwell et al., 1979). A three-dimensional structure of this protein complex should reveal the nature of the intermolecular contacts between the different subunits. It should account for the effect of zinc ions on the stability of the 7 S complex and the altered subunit activities. In addition, the structure will provide an insight into the mechanism for precursor processing that is shared by other growth factor systems (Darling et al., 1983). H ere, we report the crystallization and characterization of two crystal forms of the 7 S NGF, each of which has two polymorphs. All are suitable for X-ray analysis. The 7 S NGF complex was purified using the method described by Stach et al. (1977). Adult male murine submandibular glands (30 to 40 g; N. E. Biomedical Labs, U.K.) were used for each preparation, which utilized both Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration and DEAE-cellulose ion exchange media. The purified complex was stored in 50 mM-phosphate buffer (pH 6*8), 10 PM-Zinc! sulphate and 0.05% (w/v) azide at a concentration of 20 mg/ml, using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.56 for a 1 mg/ml solution. Analysis of the 7 S NGF crystals was performed by washing the crystals three times with crystallization buffer, then dissolving them in reducing SDS/Laemmli sample buffer or non-

reducing native sample buffer. All gels were run on a Pharmacia PhastTM System using standard separation and development techniques. Phast GelTM homogeneous 20% (w/v) acrylamide and 8 to 25yo gradient gels. All crystals were grown at 4°C in hanging drops equilibrated by vapour diffusion. Typically, 5 ~1 of stock protein was mixed on a siliconized coverslip with an equal volume of reservoir solution. The coverslip was then inverted over a well containing 1 ml of reservoir solution contained in a Linbro cell cult,ure plate, Flow Laboratories. and sealed with vacuum grease. Crystals were mounted in thin walled capillary tubes for precession photography. X-ray data were collected either on an Enraf-Nonius FAST area detector mount,ed on a GX21 rotating anode X-ray source, or on an Arndt-Wonacot,t oscillation camera using synchrotron radiation. In the latter case we used either X-ray film at, SRS Daresbury, or the image plate system developed at the EMBL outstation at DESY, Hamburg. Crystals suitable for X-ray studies were obtained from the polyethylene glycols 2000 and 4000. We have characterized two different crystalline forms of the 7 S NGF complex (Fig. 1).
Orthorhombic type A crystals

These crystals are most commonly observed and grow as rectangular lozenges from polyethylene glycol 2000 and 4000 at acidic pH. Small to medium sized crystals were obtained from mixing 5 ~1 of a 20 mg/ml protein solution in 50 mllr-sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). with 5 ~1 of a reservoir solution containing 50 mM-sodium acetate (pH +5). 10 PM.ZnS04 and 12 t,o 16O/,, (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. This resulted in a 10 ~1 drop with a pH of 5.0 (slightly below the pT of 5.15 for 7 8 NGF), which was subsequently equilibrated against. 1 ml of the reservoir solution at 4°C. By using small crystals to seed fresh drops of protein stock solution with a

reservoir of 8 to 10% polyethylene glycol 4000, large single crystals could be grown up to 0.6 mm x 62 mm x 92 mm. These crystals take between one and two weeks to grow at either 14°C or 4°C. However, the crystals are highly temperature sensitive and are degraded rapidly at room temperature. Therefore, all crystallization, examination and crystal mounting was performed at 4°C. The cell dimensions for this form called Al are shown in Table 1. Often another polymorphic form of A with a unit cell of smaller volume has been observed (see Table 1). The crystal morphologies of both Al and A2 are identical, therefore an initial examination by lowangle precession photography was necessary to determine the polymorphic form. The habit of type A crystals is such that the longer c axis is perpendicular to the two prominent crystal edges. It is possible that the variant A2 is a dehydrated form of Al as the transition to the smaller cell has been observed during data collection on the FAST area detector for an Al crystal. Variables controlling this polymorphism are not understood since both Al and A2 polymorphs are commonly found in the same crystallization drop. X-ray precession photographs taken using CuKa radiation from a rotating anode source were used to establish the Laue symmetry and systematic absences. These indicate that the A crystals belong to the space group P2,212,. The diffraction pattern extends to 2.8 A resolution using a synchrotron X-ray source (with a wavelength of 0.9 A) for both polymorphs. Systematic absences for A2 along 001, were observed for I# 4n up to (0, 0, 12), indicating approximate translational repeat of c/4. zthough a and b have similar lengths for both polymorphs, there is no clear evidence of pseudotetragonal symmetry. The precise cell dimensions shown in Table 1 for Al were determined from the processing of a complete 3.3 A resolution native dataset with a merging R-factor of 8.7% on intensities, collected using synchrotron radiation at the EMBL outstation at DESY, Hamburg. A self-rotation function was calculated for the Al data using the fast rotation function (Crowther, 1972). No peak consistent with a non-crystallographic diad axis was observed on the IC= 180 section, despite varying the Patterson integration radius and resolution cut-offs.

Tetrqonal

type B crystal

Small tetrahedral bipyramids grow from identical conditions to type A crystals, at pH 45 in polyethylene glycol 2000 and 4000. Large feathershaped and rectangular-shaped crystals of this type are commonly found growing in these conditions. These are often found in clusters of four, with a pseudo fourfold symmetry relating each small crystal to three neighbours. Large single crystals can be grown by seeding fresh protein drops using the same seeding conditions as for type A crystals but using the appropriate type B crystal seeds, The crystals grow to maximum dimensions of 65 mm x 93 mm x 93 mm in two weeks. These crystals are also highly temperature dependent and all crystal manipulations were performed at 4°C. Laue symmetry and systematic absences show the crystals to belong to the spacegroup P4,2,2 (or P4,2,2). X-ray data have been recorded for the B2 crystal form to 50 A resolution with a merging R-factor of 90% using synchrotron radiation at the SRS, Daresbury. Another polymorphic form of B, the Bl variant, has been observed on one occasion. These crystals have cell dimensions of a = 93.4 A, b = 97.8 A and c = 308.0 A, with a brick-shaped crystal morphology. Systematic absences and diffraction symmetry show these crystals to belong to the space group P22,2,. Systematic absences for 1 # 4n are observed along 001 extending to the maximum resolution measured. Since no fourfold symmetry is observed in the diffraction pattern, this indicates that the crystals probably do not have a pseudo 4, screw axis coincident with the crystallographic 2, screw axis on c. No X-ray data have been collected on these crystals. Characterization To characterize fully the proteins present in the 7 S NGF crystals, they were run on a reducing SDS/acrylamide gel. This was necessary since the stability of the 7 S complex at the crystallization conditions used was uncertain. The pattern of bands in Figure 2 (lanes 4 and 5) is expected for the 7 S, from the combination of the respective lanes of the purified NGF subunits. The a-NGF shows two bands on an SDS gel under reducing conditions, at

Additional heterogeneity is commonly observed, particularly for the y-subunit (Thomas rt al.. 1981b) and contributes to the y-NGF (Fig. 2. lane 1). A gradient native gel was also run for both crystal forms, for intact 7 S and for the individually purified subunits (Fig. 3), it shows the major band at the same position as the intact 7 S complex (lanes 3 and 4). The high concentration of 7 S NGF in the adult male submaxillary gland (O-2% by weight) has provided large quantities of a homogeneous, stable oligomeric complex. This material has been crystallized in two forms, both using polyethylene glycol as the precipitating agent (McPherson, 1976). It is the first report of the crystallization of a growth factor complex. To show the integrity of the complex, a crystal of form Al was run on an SDS reducing gel. All the predicted bands from an intact 7 S complex for in Figure 2 by a comparison can be accounted with purified subunits. In addition, the small amounts of high molecular weight contaminants present in the purified 7 S NGF complex are absent in the crystal, as is often seen in the purification of proteins by crystallization. Since the method of purification allows the rapid separation of the entire 7 S complex, this gel indicates that this identical

material is present in the Al crystal form. A native gel confirmed this using crystals of both the Al and B2 forms (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). However, although the principal band in lanes 3 and 4 is the 7 S. in (Fig. 3. common with the intact 7 S complex lane 2), it dissociates slightly during the gel separation and loses a proportion of a-subunitIs (set& lane 6). and the high cotl(`etlThe presence of' 10 PM-zinc tration of 7 S complex are likely to have stabilized the complex at the acidic pH used for crystallization. Silverman & Bradshaw (1982) have defined the stability of the 7 S complex at pH extremes. At pH 5.0, a 1 mg/ml solution of 7 S complex has ii reduced association between the b and y subunit)s. and may lead to the latter's dissociation from the complex. However. each of the ?;-NGF bands are clearly observed in Figure 2. m(Jkdar mass The 7 S complex has an estimated of 130,000. The absence of any ~rystallogra~phic diad axes in the type A crystal space group and w knowledge of the unit, cell volume imply that the whole complex is in the asymmetric unit. If two complexes were present the solvent, content would be unacceptably low at 23?;,. The st,oichiometry of the complex and the stability of t,he /I-NGF dimer indicate that a molecular t,wo-fold may be possible in the 7 S complex. For the Al crystals. no pseudomirror plane was identified in the diffraction pattern and no peak was found in the self-rotation func+ion or a native Patterson map to support the presence of a non-crystallographic diad axis.

For the type B2 crystals the doubling of the c axis (relative to form A) with eight asymmetric units in suggest that there is one the unit cell, would complex per asymmetric unit, stacked along the crystallographic c axis. This implies a similarity in the way the 7 S complex is packed in the two forms. The large differences in the diffraction patterns for the two forms indicate that although the arrangement may be similar, the orientation of the complex is likely to be different. Electron micrographs using negative staining suggested that the 7 S complex has a closed point symmetry, with the subunits arranged group symmetrically (McDonald et al., 1990). This is to be expected from studies on other oligomeric complexes (Darnall & Klotz, 1972). The micrographs also indicated that the complex has an approximate diameter of 80 A. The molecular dimensions of the /?-NGF dimer have been recently the determined as 60 A x 30 A x 25 A, indicating highly asymmetric shape of the dimer. The dimensions of a serine proteinase molecule have been showntobe35A x 35A x 30A(BodeetaZ., 1983). Assuming each fi-NGF protomer binds one M and one y-NGF subunit, this suggests a 7 8 complex with dimensions of SO A x SO A x 35 A would be consistent with the electron micrographs and the known dimensions of each subunit.

pack four (or eight) such 7 S complex molecules in the A (or B) unit cell, is by stacking them along the crystallographic c axis with the shorter dimension parallel to c. This would also account for the similarity of the a and b cell dimensions of each crystal form and polymorph. However, this arrangement can only be unequivocally shown from the final structure analysis. Models for the a and y-NGF subunits can be constructed from appropriate high resolution structures available for the serine proteinase family (Freer et aE., 1970; Bode et al., 1983). The availability of the /?-NGF structure and models for c1and y-NGF provide three suitable search models for a molecular replacement solution for 7 S NGF (Bax, McDonald & Blundell, unpublished results). In parallel with these studies, heavy atom trials are also in progress so that multiple isomorphous replacement may be used to obtain experimental phases.
