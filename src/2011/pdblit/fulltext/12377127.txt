Abstract Escherichia coli FtsH is an ATP-dependent and membrane-bound protease, which belongs to the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities family. FtsH degrades a subset of cytoplasmic regulatory proteins and misassembled membrane proteins. It has been proposed that ATP-dependent proteases unfold and translocate substrate proteins into the protease chamber. Previously, we reported that Phe228 and Gly230 in the conserved motif, @XG (where @ is an aromatic residue and X is any residue), in the central pore of the FtsH ATPase ring have important roles in proteolysis and its coupling to ATP hydrolysis. In this paper, we constructed and characterized additional pore mutants. Results indicated that certain acidic residues located in the pore region are also important for the activity of FtsH. Proteolytic activities of most mutants are correlated with their ATPase activities. Evidence also indicated that Val229, the 2nd residue of the @XG motif, may have a substrate-speciWc role. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction ATP-dependent proteases, universally conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, play important roles in diverse cellular processes (for review, Gottesman, 2003; Schmidt et al., 1999; Wickner et al., 1999; Zwickl et al., 2000). All ATP-dependent proteases belong to the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities plus (AAA+) superfamily and share a conserved ATPase domain of 200­250 amino acid residues (Lupas and Martin, 2002; Neuwald et al., 1999; Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001). Escherichia coli FtsH is responsible for quality control of membrane proteins by degrading misassembled membrane proteins. It also contributes to the control of cellular functions through degradation of a subset of cytoplasmic regulatory proteins (for review, Akiyama et al., 2004; Gottesman, 2003; Ito and Akiyama, 2005).

AAA+ proteases usually form barrel-shaped oligomers with a narrow central pore. Pore sizes revealed by X-ray crystal structural analysis are t10 Å in diameter (Bochtler et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2002), which is too narrow to allow the passage of natively folded proteins. Crystal structures of the AAA ATPase domains of E. coli and Thermus thermophilus FtsHs have been solved (Krzywda et al., 2002; Niwa et al., 2002). An electron microscopic study indicated that FtsH forms ring-shaped homo-oligomers similar to other AAA+ proteases (Shotland et al., 1997). Unfolding and translocation of the substrate proteins are necessary for proteolysis by AAA+ proteases, since the active sites are located in a chamber within the barrel (Bochtler et al., 1997; Groll et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997). Wang et al. (2001) Wrst pointed out the presence of a conserved motif, @XG (where @ is an aromatic residue and X is any residue), in the central pore of the ATP-dependent proteases and the ClpB/Hsp104 chaperones (see Fig. 1). They also proposed a protein unfolding-coupled translocation model in which the conserved aromatic residue is crucial for polypeptide binding and mediates

directional translocation. The functional importance of the conserved pore motif in the pore-1 sequence has been veriWed for several ATP-dependent proteases, HslUV (Park et al., 2005; Song et al., 2000), FtsH (Yamada-Inagawa et al., 2003), ClpXP (Siddiqui et al., 2004), and ClpAP (Hinnerwisch et al., 2005), and ClpB chaperone (Schlieker et al., 2004; Weibezahn et al., 2004) by site-directed mutagenesis. It was further indicated that acidic residues located in the pore region of ClpB are important for substrate binding (Schlieker et al., 2004). In addition, it was also indicated that many residues in the pore-2 loop, which forms the pore structure together with the pore-1 loop, of ClpA are also important for substrate binding (Hinnerwisch et al., 2005). However, the precise molecular mechanisms of substrate unfolding and threading are still largely unknown. To obtain further insights into the function of the central pore, we constructed and characterized both the pore-1 and pore-2 mutants of FtsH. Our present results suggest that certain acidic residues in both the pore-1 and pore-2 loops are important for ATPase activity and that the 2nd residue of the @XG motif has a substrate-speciWc role. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Strains and plasmids

ftsH fragments were produced by sequential PCR steps using synthetic primers. The KpnI­NcoI segment of pIFH108 was replaced with each mutated fragment. 2.2. Protein preparation FtsH was expressed in E. coli strain AR5771 and puriWed by the procedures described previously (Yamada-Inagawa et al., 2003). Sigma32 was prepared as described previously (Okuno et al., 2004). PuriWed 32 was labeled with Cy3 mono-reactive dye (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C in the dark, and unreacted excess Cy3 dye was removed with Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences). PuriWed proteins were stored at ¡80 °C. 2.3. Protein degradation assays Substrate proteins were incubated with FtsH at 42 °C in reaction buVer [50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 25 M Zn(OAc)2,1 mM DTT, and 0.1% NP-40] plus 3 mM ATP or ADP. Fluorescence of BODIPY (emission at 505 nm; excitation at 513 nm) and Cy3 (emission at 570 nm; excitation at 550 nm) was measured by a spectroXuorometer (Jasco FP-750). 2.4. ATPase assays

DH5 [recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 deoR (argF-lac)U169 
80lacZ M15] and AR5771 [BL21(DE3) sfhC21 ftsH3::kan hXKC3::tet] were used as host strains for construction of plasmids and for expression of genes cloned on plasmids. Cells were grown in L medium (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 5 g NaCl/L, pH 7.4). Ampicillin (100 g/ml) was added for growing strains carrying plasmid. pIFH108 has been described (Karata et al., 1999). AR3317 [IN(rrnD-rrnE)1 ftsH1 (Ts) zgj-3198::Tn10kan zad220::Tn10] (Ogura et al., 1999) was used for the complementation assay of the temperature sensitivity of the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation. Colony-forming ability of the strain carrying plasmids was assayed at 42 °C. All mutant ftsH plasmids were constructed by replacing a segment of ftsH on pIFH108 with a mutated fragment. The mutants were as follows: E273D (GAA to GAT), E273Q (GAA to CAG), E273A (GAA to GCG), E273K (GAA to AAA), E226Q (GAA to CAG), E226A (GAA to GCG), E226K (GAA to AAA), D223K (GAC to AAA), D272N (GAT to AAC), M227K (ATG to AAA), V229F (GTC to TTC), and H271D (CAC to GAC): mutagenized

ATPase activity was measured as described by Akiyama et al. (1996). 2.5. Western blotting Western blotting was carried out as described by Ogura et al. (1999). Cells were grown at 30 °C, transferred to 42 °C, and incubated for 2.5 h. Samples were analyzed by SDS­ PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti- 32 (Gamer et al., 1992) or anti-LpxC (a gift from Franz Narberhaus) antiserum. 3. Results 3.1. Construction and in vivo characterization of FtsH mutants altering acidic residues in the pore region We previously found that the conserved residues in the pore region of the FtsH hexamer, Phe228 and Gly230, play important roles in proteolysis and its coupling to ATP

hydrolysis (Yamada-Inagawa et al., 2003). Recently, Schlieker et al. (2004) showed that acidic residues (Glu254 and Glu257 in Fig. 1) as well as the conserved aromatic residue (Tyr251) in the pore region of ClpB chaperone are also important for substrate binding. Although these acidic residues are not conserved in the multiple alignment shown in Fig. 1, we have noticed that some acidic residues are localized in a similar region of the FtsH hexamer. These are Glu273, Glu226, and Asp223 (Fig. 2). Asp223 and Glu226 in FtsH are from the N-terminal region of the pore-1 loop, whereas Glu254 and Glu257 in ClpB are from the C-terminal region of the pore-1 loop (Fig. 1). In the C-terminal region of the pore-1 loop in FtsH, there is no acidic residue. Interestingly, Glu273 in FtsH is from the pore-2 loop, which is separated from the pore-1 loop by a t30 aminoacid stretch consisting of an -helix and Walker B -sheet in the primary sequence (Fig. 1). The 272nd residue before Glu273 is also acidic. The position of Asp272 is inside the central pore (Fig. 2).

We introduced mutations into these acidic residues systematically. The constructed mutants were tested for the complementation activity of the temperature-sensitive ftsH1 (Ts) mutation. Results showed that Glu273 and Glu226 are functionally important (Table 1). The 273rd residue must be acidic, since E273D but not E273Q, E273A, and E273K complemented the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation. On the other hand, Glu226 can be functionally replaced by a polar residue, Gln, although Ala or Lys can not functionally replace it. E273Q and E226A mutants complemented the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation partially, and smaller numbers of temperature-resistant colonies arose. D223K and D272N complemented the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation, indicating that Asp223 and Asp272 are less important. We have indicated that the FtsH function essential for cell viability is proteolysis of the LpxC enzyme, which is involved in lipid A biosynthesis (Ogura et al., 1999). Therefore, we examined proteolytic activity of the mutant FtsH

ATPase activity, and thus the proteolytic activity, of FtsH. It is interesting that the eVect of E273Q on protease activity was more severe for a folded substrate, 32, than for an unfolded substrate, casein. Although both D223K and D272N mutants complemented the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation, the mutational eVects were diVerent. The D223K mutation greatly reduced both ATPase and protease activities, whereas the D272N mutation aVected these activities minimally (Table 1). These results are consistent with the in vivo results by Western blotting (Fig. 3). 3.3. Additional mutants carrying a mutation in the pore region

proteins in vivo by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3, all of the mutants of acidic residues, which did not complement or partially complemented the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation, i.e., E273Q, E273A, E273K, E226A, and E226K, accumulated LpxC. D223K also signiWcantly accumulated LpxC, although it complemented the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation. We also examined proteolytic activity of the mutant FtsH proteins against another physiological substrate, 32. Results indicated that proteolytic activity against 32 was essentially correlated with that against LpxC (Fig. 3). However, it should be noted that among the mutants of acidic residues accumulating LpxC E273Q, E273A, E226A, and D223K retain signiWcantly high activity to degrade 32. 3.2. In vitro characterization of puriWed mutant FtsH proteins We puriWed these mutant FtsH proteins and examined their ATPase and protease activities in vitro. Mutations in functionally important, negatively charged residues, E273 and D226, which alter to polar, hydrophobic, and positively charged residues, reduced both ATPase and casein-degrading activities in this order (Table 1). It is likely that the negative charges of these critical residues are important for the

The residue just before the critical aromatic residue, Phe228, is Met in FtsH. In ClpA and ClpB, the corresponding residue is Lys (Fig. 1). Accordingly, we constructed an M227K mutant of FtsH. It has been shown that mutations of the second residue in the @XG pore motif of ClpX, Val154, aVect substrate speciWcity (Siddiqui et al., 2004). Therefore, we constructed a V229F mutant of FtsH. His271 is located inside the pore and Xanked by two acidic residues, Glu273 and Asp272, topologically (Fig. 2). Previously, we constructed F228E mutant of FtsH, and it showed an increased ATPase activity, but reduced protease activity (Yamada-Inagawa et al., 2003). To further investigate the eVects of an increase of negative charges in the pore region, we constructed a H271D mutant of FtsH. This may also create fully acidic environment of the pore inside (Fig. 2). Among these mutants, M227K and H271D mutants complemented the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation, whereas V229F mutant did not (Table 1). Western blotting indicated that H271D mutant retained high proteolytic activity against both LpxC and 32, and that the M227K mutation impaired proteolytic activity against both LpxC and 32 signiWcantly. Interestingly, the V229F mutation impaired

proteolytic activity against LpxC dramatically, which is consistent with the observed defective complementation of the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation, but this mutation aVected proteolytic activity against 32 minimally (Fig. 3). In vitro assays using puriWed mutant proteins showed that ATPase and casein-degrading activities were only moderately aVected by these mutations, and that proteolytic activity against 32 was more severely aVected by the M227K mutation (Table 1). These results are fully consistent with the results of Western blotting as described above. Therefore, V229F mutant is defective in proteolysis of LpxC and thus fails to complement the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation speciWcally. 4. Discussion 4.1. Importance of negatively charged residues in the pore region Among four acidic residues in the pore region of FtsH, the results indicated that Glu273 and Glu226 are functionally important. Although the positions of these residues in the primary sequence are diVerent from those of the critical acidic residues in ClpB, the spatial positions are similar. However, the function of the negatively charged residues in the pore region in FtsH seems to be diVerent from that in ClpB. In the case of ClpB, E254A/E257A double mutant shows defects in substrate-binding without apparent defect in ATPase activity (Schlieker et al., 2004). A similar result has been obtained for E88Q mutant of HslU. Glu88 in HslU corresponds to Glu226 in FtsH in the primary sequence (Fig. 1). E88Q mutant of HslU shows an ATPase activity comparable to that of the wild type, but shows signiWcantly reduced protease activities against various substrates (Song et al., 2000). As described above, however, mutants of Glu273 and Glu226 of FtsH exhibit reduced ATPase activity, which are roughly correlated with protease activity. Therefore, it is likely that the primary defect caused by mutations in Glu273 and Glu226 of FtsH is ATPase activity. The mutational eVect of Asp223 also seems to be primarily on ATPase activity. The reason for diVerent eVects of mutations in the acidic residues in the pore region is to be elucidated. Our previous study has indicated that the F228E mutation increases ATPase activity to 137%, while the F228K mutation decreases it to 17% (Yamada-Inagawa et al., 2003). The eVects of mutations in Glu273, Glu226, and Asp223 described above show a similar tendency, i.e., decreasing negative charge or increasing positive charge causes decrease in ATPase activity (Table 1). The fact that the M227K mutation decreases ATPase activity is also consistent with this notion. In this respect, it is interesting that alterations of the charge of residues located inside the pore, D272N and H271D, do not signiWcantly aVect ATPase activity (Table 1). Although the mechanism that charge alteration in the pore region aVects ATPase activity remains unknown, these results collectively suggest a coupling mechanism between substrate binding/translocation and ATP hydrolysis.

4.2. Val229 as a key residue in substrate speciWcity The V229F mutation does not aVect ATPase activity (Table 1), and reduces proteolytic activities against casein and 32 only moderately (Table 1 and Fig. 3). However, this mutant is severely defective in degradation of LpxC (Fig. 3) and hence does not complement the ftsH1 (Ts) mutation (Table 1). Thus, it is most likely that V229F mutant is defective in proteolysis of certain substrates. This Wnding is fully consistent with the notion that V154F mutant of ClpX is severely defective in a class of substrates (Siddiqui et al., 2004). V92G mutant of HslU is also defective in degradation of SulA but not in degradation of casein or peptide (Song et al., 2000), although V92F mutant of HslU is defective in degradation of both SulA and casein but not peptide (Park et al., 2005). It seems that the hydrophobic residue, Val in FtsH, ClpX, and HslU, in the 2nd position of the conserved pore-1 motif, @XG, is important for speciWc substrates. 4.3. Importance of the pore-2 loop The central pore consists of both the pore-1 and pore-2 loops. Although the conserved motif, @XG, has been identiWed in the pore-1 sequence, the pore-2 sequence is more diverse in both sequence and length (Fig. 1). Therefore, it has not yet been studied for the function of the pore-2 loop extensively so far. Recently, Hinnerwisch et al. (2005) have exploited substrate-binding regions of ClpA by chemical crosslinking techniques, and identiWed the pore-1 loop of ClpA-D2. They have also tested a series of mutants carrying a single-residue substitution in D1, and found that many mutations in the pore-2 loop as well as the pore-1 loop abolish substrate binding. These are G251D, L253D, L254D, A255D, Y259A, and R260A in the pore-1 loop, and A293D, G294D, A296D, and S297D in the pore-2 loop (see Fig. 1). In the present study, we have examined the mutational eVects of His271, Asp272, and Glu273 in the pore-2 loop, and found that Glu273 is functionally important as described above. Further extensive analysis of the pore region is required for better understanding of the mechanisms of substrate binding, unfolding, translocation, ATP hydrolysis, and their coupling.
