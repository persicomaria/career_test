A combination of five thermostabilizing mutations, Gly23 fi Ala, His62 fi Pro, Val74 fi Leu, Lys95 fi Gly, and Asp134 fi His, has been shown to additively enhance the thermostability of Escherichia coli RNase HI [Akasako A, Haruki M, Oobatake M & Kanaya S (1995) Biochemistry 34, 8115­8122]. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the protein with these mutations (5H-RNase HI) to analyze the effects of the mutations on the structure in detail. The structures of the mutation sites were almost identical to those of the mutant proteins to which the mutations were individually introduced, except for G23A, for which the structure of the single mutant protein is not available. Moreover, only slight changes in the backbone conformation of the protein were observed, and the interactions of the side chains were almost conserved. These results indicate that these mutations almost independently affect the protein structure, and are consistent with the fact that the thermostabiling effects of the mutations are cumulative. We also determined the protein stability curve describing the temperature dependence of the free energy of unfolding of 5H-RNase HI to elucidate the thermostabilization mechanism. The maximal stability for 5H-RNase HI was as high as that for the cysteine-free variant of Thermus thermophilus RNase HI. In contrast, the heat capacity of unfolding for 5H-RNase H was similar to that for E. coli RNase HI, which is considerably higher than that for T. thermophilus RNase HI. These results suggest that 5H-RNase HI is stabilized, in part, by the thermostabilization mechanism adopted by T. thermophilus RNase HI. ties. Such information will be helpful in the design of mutations for creating hyperthermostable proteins. For this purpose, we used Escherichia coli RNase HI as a model protein. E. coli RNase HI degrades only the RNA strand of an RNAÆDNA hybrid [7], and is composed of a single polypeptide chain with 155 amino acid residues [8]. This protein is suitable for the analysis of structure­stability relationships, because the thermal denaturation of the

Combination of mutations that enhance protein stability is considered to be a promising strategy to obtain hyperthermostable proteins. This strategy has proved effective for several proteins, such as subtilisn BPN¢ [1], k repressor [2], T4 lysozyme [3], barnase [4], RNase HI [5], and 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase [6]. It is of interest whether the effects of the individual mutations on the structure are independent or not, and how the mutations affect thermodynamic proper-

protein is reversible, and allows us to compare the thermodynamic stabilities of the mutant proteins with that of the wild-type protein [9,10]. In addition, the three-dimensional structures of this protein [11­13] and its thermophilic counterpart, RNase H from Thermus thermophilus HB8 [14], have been determined by X-ray analyses. The thermostabilizing mutations of E. coli RNase HI have been explored, and their effects on the structure have been studied by X-ray crystallography [15­21]. Of them, five thermostabilizing mutations (Gly23 fi Ala, His62 fi Pro, Val74 fi Leu, Lys95 fi Gly, and Asp134 fi His) have been combined to construct a quintuple mutant protein, 5H-RNase HI [5]. These mutations increase the melting temperature (Tm) of the wild-type protein by 1.8, 4.1, 3.3, 6.8 and 7.0 °C, respectively, at pH 5.5. Thermostabilizing effects of these mutations are cumulative, making 5H-RNase HI more stable than the wild-type protein by 20.2 °C in Tm at pH 5.5. For four of these mutations (His62 fi Pro, Val74 fi Leu, Lys95 fi Gly, and Asp134 fi His), the crystal structures of the individual single mutant proteins have been determined [17,18,21]. The results indicate that the individual mutations cause conformational changes predominantly around the respective mutation sites. However, it remains to be determined whether the structure of the protein is equally changed when these mutations are simultaneously introduced. NMR analyses on amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts and nuclear Overhauser effects of 5H-RNase HI have demonstrated that the mutations had only slight effects on the backbone conformation of the protein [22]. On the other hand, the conformational change of the side chains of this protein has not been investigated so far. Besides the structural analyses, thermodynamic analyses would facilitate understanding of the thermostabilization mechanism of proteins. For the thermodynamic analyses, the protein stability curve, which plots the temperature dependence of conformational free energy change (DG), has been widely used [23]. The intersection of the stability curves on the abscissa represents Tm. Three models for affording higher Tm have been proposed: shift of the entire stability curve to higher DG by increasing the change in the enthalpy at the temperature of maximum stability (DHs) (model A); broadening the stability curve by reducing the heat capacity change accompanying protein unfolding (DCp) (model B); and shift of the entire stability curve to higher temperatures by reducing the change in the entropy of the folding transition (DS) (model C) (Fig. 1) [24]. DHs corresponds to the strength of interactions between side chains in a native structure. It has

been shown that DCp correlates with change in accessible surface area (DASA) for protein unfolding [25­27]. Hollien and Marqusee have compared the stability curves of T. thermophilus and E. coli RNases HI and demonstrated that T. thermophilus RNase HI is stabilized by the strategy of model A and B [28]. As four of the five mutations introduced into 5H-RNase HI, Gly23 fi Ala, His62 fi Pro, Val74 fi Leu, and Lys95 fi Gly, represent those from E. coli RNase HI to T. thermophilus RNase HI, it is of interest to examine whether 5H-RNase HI is stabilized by the same strategy or not. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure and the stability curve of 5H-RNase HI to analyze the effects of the mutations on the structure and thermodynamic properties of E. coli RNase HI in detail.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure The crystal structure of 5H-RNase HI was determined ° at 1.32 A resolution. Two crystal structures are available for the metal-free E. coli RNase HI wild-type protein. They are the metal-free enzyme I (MFEI) [13] (Protein Data Bank entry 1RNH) and the metal-free enzyme II (MFEII) [11,12] (Protein Data Bank entry 2RN2). The MFEI and MFEII crystals, which belong to the same space group (P212121) but have slightly different unit cell dimensions, were classified as type I ° ° ° (a ¼ 41.79 A, b ¼ 86.34 A, c ¼ 36.31 A) and type II ° ° ° (a ¼ 44.06 A, b ¼ 86.85 A, c ¼ 35.47 A), respectively,

by Yang et al. [13]. As summarized in Table 1, the unit cell dimensions of 5H-RNase HI crystal are similar to those of the MFEII crystal. The overall structure of 5H-RNase HI is essentially the same as that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2A). The rms displacement between the wild-type protein ° (MFEII) and 5H-RNase HI is 0.52 A for the coordinates of all a-carbon atoms. The rms displacements between the wild-type protein and the mutant proteins ° with the single mutations are 0.16­0.71 A. The DASA between the unfolded and folded states of 5H° RNase H is 12 666 A2, which is similar to that for the ° wild-type protein (12 916 A2) [12]. Figure 3 illustrates the coordinate shifts of the a-carbon atoms of 5H-RNase HI relative to the wild-type structure (2RN2). The shifts are small for most of the residues. Relatively large shifts are observed for the residues around the mutation sites except for 134. In addition to these mutation sites, large shifts are observed in the N-terminus, around Leu14 in the turn between the bA-strand and bB-strand, around Gly30 in the turn between the bB-strand and bC-strand,

around Gly123 in the loop connecting the bE-strand and aV-helix, and in the C-terminus. These shifts are probably due to fluctuations, which have been suggested by molecular dynamics simulation analyses [29­ 31], rather than perturbations caused by the mutations. Another large shift is observed around Gln113, which should be due to the elimination of a hydrogen bond between His62 and Gln113, as observed for the single mutant protein, H62P [18]. Interactions of the side chains Ionic interactions of the side chains observed in the wild-type protein are almost fully conserved in 5HRNase HI. However, rearrangement of the hydrogen bonds is observed at the region where Ser71 is located (Fig. 2B). Ser71 Oc turns away from Glu48 Oe1, resulting in elimination of the hydrogen bonds between Ser71 Oc and Glu48 Oe1, and between Ser71 Oc and Val74 N, accompanying the formation of those between Ser71 Oc and Thr69 Oc, and between Glu48 Oe1 and Leu74 N. A shift of the main chain seems to cause this rearrangement. This shift puts ° Ser71 Cb closer to Glu48 Oe1 by 0.17 A as compared to that of the wild-type protein. As the distance between Ser71 Oc and Glu48 Oe1 in the wild-type pro° tein is 2.60 A, Ser71 Oc must come close enough to Glu48 Oe1 in 5H-RNase HI to cause a steric crash, if it assumes the same orientation as in the wild-type protein. As a result, Ser71 Oc should turn away from Glu48 Oe1 and Leu74 N to a favorable position to form a hydrogen bond with Thr69 Oc1. Similar rearrangement of the hydrogen bonds is observed in the single mutant protein, V74L, indicating that the Val74 fi Leu mutation is responsible for this rearrangement (data not shown). It is unlikely that this rearrangement seriously affects the thermostability of the protein, because the loss of the hydrogen bonds could be compensated for by the newly formed ones. NMR H­D exchange analyses have shown that the free energy for opening of the hydrogen bond between the amide proton of Thr69 and the carbonyl oxygen of Glu119 is increased in 5H-RNase HI, indicating a restriction of the local breathing [22]. The formation of the hydrogen bond between Ser71 Oc and Thr69 Oc might be a reason for this restriction of the local breathing. In addition, hydrogen bonds are newly formed between Glu61 Oe2 and Arg29 Ng2 in the 5H-RNase HI structure. However, the side chains of Glu61 and Arg29, which are fully exposed to the solvent, should not form tight interactions due to fluctuations suggested by their large temperature factors. Therefore,

the wild-type protein are summarized in Table 2. Crystal structures of the single mutant proteins, except for G23A, have been determined, and their stabilizing mechanisms have been suggested: The His62 fi Pro mutation stabilizes the protein by decreasing the entropy of the unfolded state [18]. The Val74 fi Leu mutation stabilizes the protein by filling a cavity [17]. The Lys95 fi Gly mutation stabilizes the protein because of the elimination of the strain caused by the left-handed backbone structure [18]. The Asp134 fi His mutation stabilizes the protein by reducing the negative charge repulsion among the active site residues [19]. These mutations probably stabilize 5H-RNase HI by similar mechanisms, because the structures of the amino acid residues around the mutation sites in 5H-RNase HI are basically identical to those in the single mutant proteins, except for the differences described below (Fig. 2D­G). The v1 angle of the side chain of Leu74 in 5H-RNase HI is very different from that of Val74 in V74L, whereas it is similar to that of Val74 in the wild-type protein. Thus, Cc of Leu74 in 5H-RNase HI assumes a stable `t' conformation like Cc1 of Val74 in the wildtype protein, whereas that of Leu74 in V74L assumes an eclipsed conformation. As a result, Cc of Leu74 in 5H-RNase HI greatly deviates from that in V74L, whereas it is located close to Cc1 of the parent residue. The v2 angles of the side chains of Leu74 in 5H-RNase HI and those in V74L differ by $ 120°, and the d atoms of Leu74 in both proteins adopt stable staggered conformations. In consequence, the Cd1 and Cd2 atoms of Leu74 in 5H-RNase HI are located close to the Cd2 and Cd1 atoms, respectively, of Leu74 in V74L. Moreover, the locations of the residues forming the cavity in 5H-RNase HI are almost unchanged from those in V74L. Accordingly, Cd1 of Leu74 in 5H-RNase HI, instead of Cd2 of Leu74 in V74L, is located close to Cb of Ala52 and the Cd2 atoms of Leu49 and

Leu107. These structural features suggest that the Cd1 and Cd2 atoms of Leu74 in 5H-RNase HI fill the cavity as efficiently as those in V74L. Taking the more favorable v1 angle of the side chain of Leu74 in 5H-RNase HI than that in V74L into consideration, the Val74 fi Leu mutation in 5H-RNase HI might enhance the thermostability of the protein to a higher level than that in V74L. Hisl24 in 5H-RNase HI deviates considerably from that in the single mutant protein, D134H. In D134H, the His124 side chain is located near the active site, and this structural feature is also observed in the MFEI structure. In contrast, the imidazole side chain lies far from the active site in 5H-RNase HI, as found in the MFEII structure. The difference in positions of His124 could result from the intrinsic flexibility of this loop and the crystal packing effect, but not from the mutations at residue 134. The crystal structure of the single mutant protein G23A has not been determined, and this is the first report to reveal the crystal structure of E. coli RNase HI containing the Gly23 fi Ala mutation. In the wild-type protein, there is a space around the a-carbon of Gly23, which is formed by the Cb atoms of the surrounding Cys133 and Leu136 residues in the wild-type protein [12]. The methyl group of the substituted alanine residue in 5H-RNase HI is located in close proximity to the Cb atoms of Cys133 and Leu136, thereby filling the space (Fig. 2C). The stabilization by a Gly fi Ala substitution that fills a cavity has been reported for chick glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [32]. Cavity-filling mutations are considered to increase hydrophobic interactions, thereby stabilizing proteins through an enthalpic effect. It has also been proposed that a Gly fi Ala substitution enhances protein stability by decreasing the entropy of unfolding [33]. The protein could be stabilized by such an entropic effect as well as the enthalpic effect. Stability curve of 5H-RNase HI The DG(H2O) of 5H-RNase HI determined by guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation was plotted as a function of temperature to give the protein stability curve shown in Fig. 4.

where DHm is the enthalpy of unfolding at the transition midpoint temperature (Tm), and DCp is the difference in heat capacity between the native and unfolded

states. The thermodynamic parameters were determined to be 352 ± 1 K for Tm, 155 ± 3 kcalÆmol)1 for Hm, and 2.7 ± 0.1 kcalÆmol)1ÆK)1 for DCp by fitting the plot to Eqn (1) using a calculation program (igor pro 3.0). So far, the stability curves of cysteine-free variants of E. coli and T. thermophilus RNases HI (RNases HI*) have been determined [28]. The Tm value of 5H-RNase HI obtained from the stability curve (79 °C) was 13 °C higher than that of E. coli RNase HI* (66 °C) and 7 °C lower than that of T. thermophilus RNase HI* (86 °C) [28]. The thermal stabilities of 5H-RNase HI and T. thermophilus RNase HI (WT) have been studied by thermal denaturation in the presence of 1.0­ 1.2 m guanidine hydrochloride [5,34]. The 5H-RNase HI is less stable than T. thermophilus RNase HI (WT) by $ 14 °C in Tm. As T. thermophilus RNase HI (WT) becomes less stable by $ 7 °C under reducing condition [35], 5H-RNase HI is less stable than T. thermophilus RNase-HI by $ 7 °C under reducing condition. The Tm value of T. thermophilus RNase HI* has been reported to be almost same as that of T. thermophilus RNase HI (WT) under reducing conditions [28]. Therefore, the Tm value of 5H-RNase HI from the stability curve is in good agreement with that obtained from the thermal denaturation. The maximum free energy change of unfolding (DGs) of 5H-RNase HI was 11.9 kcalÆmol)1 at 27 °C, which was 4.4 kcalÆmol)1 higher than that of E. coli RNase HI* and 0.8 kcalÆmol)1 lower than that of T. thermophilus RNase HI* [28].

temperature at which DG is at a maximum) was 27 °C, which was slightly higher than those of E. coli RNase HI* (24 °C) and T. thermophilus RNase HI* (20 °C). The DCp value of 5H-RNase HI (2.7 kcalÆ mol)1ÆK)1) was similar to that of E. coli RNase HI* (2.7 kcalÆmol)1ÆK)1) and 0.9 kcalÆmol)1ÆK)1 higher than that of T. thermophilus RNase HI* (1.8 kcalÆ mol)1ÆK)1), indicating an unchanged dependence of the DG(H2O) on temperature between E. coli wild-type and 5H-RNase HI. As a result, 5H-RNase HI achieves a higher Tm than E. coli RNase HI* by shifting the entire stability curve upwards without changing its shape (model A) (Fig. 1). A similar type of stabilization has been reported for several other proteins, such as Bacillus stearothermophilus histidine-containing protein [36]. The lower DCp of T. thermophilus RNase HI* results in broadening of the stability curve, which is a reason for the higher Tm of T. thermophilus RNase HI* than that of 5H-RNase H in spite of their similar DGs values. An increase in DHs, unless changes in DS cancel it, can result in a similar stability curve with an overall increase in DG for unfolding of a protein at any temperature. Higher DHs corresponds to favorable interactions between side chains in a native structure. In fact, the Gly23 fi Ala and Val74 fi Leu mutations are considered to increase hydrophobic interactions. The reduction of the negative-charge repulsion by the Asp134 fi His mutation and the elimination of the conformational strain by the Lys95 fi Gly mutation might also contribute to increasing the DHs. It has been suggested that the His62 fi Pro mutation stabilizes the protein by decreasing the entropy of the unfolded state, which leads to reduction in the entropy change for the folding transition (DS) [18]. Such a reduction in DS would shift the entire stability curve and Ts to higher temperatures (model C) (Fig. 1). In fact, the Ts value of 5H-RNase HI was 3 °C higher than that of E. coli RNase HI*, which is consistent with the increase in Tm caused by the His62 fi Pro mutation (4.1 °C). However, the Ts value of T. thermophilus RNase HI*, which also has proline at position 62, is 4 °C lower than that of E. coli RNase HI* [28]. Further study will be required to account for this discrepancy. The thermodynamic parameter DCp has been found to correlate with DASA for protein unfolding [25­27]. The DASA values of 5H-RNase HI and E. coli RNase HI* are quite similar, which is consistent with the identical DCp values for these proteins. Although the DCp is considerably decreased for T. thermophilus RNase HI*, its DASA is almost unchanged as compared to E. coli RNase HI* [28]. The core region of

T. thermophilus RNase HI* has been suggested to be responsible for the low DCp by swapping the folding core of E. coli RNase HI* with that of T. thermophilus RNase HI* [37]. It has also been suggested that a structured hydrophobic cluster persisting in the unfolded state of T. thermophilus RNase HI* causes the reduced DCp [37,38]. Of the mutations in 5H-RNase HI, His62 fi Pro, Val74 fi Leu and Lys95 fi Gly are involved in the folding core. All of them are the replacements occurring in T. thermophilus RNase HI. As the Val74 fi Leu mutation will favor hydrophobic interactions in the unfolded state, this mutation seems to be propitious for forming the structured hydrophobic cluster. However, the unchanged DCp of 5HRNase HI suggests that this mutation does not contribute or is insufficient to form the hydrophobic cluster. The Ile53 fi Asp mutation has been shown to increase DCp of T. thermophilus RNase HI* [37]. Therefore, multiple residues would be required for the hydrophobic cluster formation, which is consistent with the independent contribution of the five mutations to the thermostabilization and the structure. Moreover, theoretical and experimental studies have proposed that electrostatic interactions contribute to reduce the DCp value [39,40]. Identification of the residues involved in these hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions is of great interest for the development of a novel strategy to enhance the thermostability of proteins by reducing the DCp that is adopted by thermophilic proteins.

Conclusions
The current results indicate that the simultaneous introduction of the five mutations causes conformational changes predominantly around the respective mutation sites, and has only slight effects on the backbone conformation of the protein. Moreover, the effects of the mutations on the structure of 5H-RNase HI are similar to those on the mutant proteins to which the mutations are individually introduced, indicating that the mutations affect the protein structure independently, but not cooperatively. This result is consistent with the fact that the thermostabilizing effects of the mutations are cumulative. The stability curve of 5H-RNase HI entirely shifts upward without changing its shape, unlike that of T. thermophilus RNase HI, which is also broadened, indicating that the introduced mutations contribute to increasing the maximal stability, but not to reducing the heat capacity of unfolding. These results indicate that interactions arising from replacements other than those introduced into 5H-RNase HI are required to reduce DCp, which

is another strategy for thermostabilization of T. thermophilus RNase HI.

Guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation
Guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding profile of 5HRNase HI was measured the CD signal at 225 nm on a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J-805 (Japan Spectroscopic Company, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a temperature-controlled cell holder. The CD signal was averaged for 1 min in a 0.2 cm path length cuvette. Guanidine hydrochlorideinduced denaturation was performed by serial addition of solution A (5 mm NaOAc, pH 5.5, 50 mm KCl, 40 lgÆmL)1 protein) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride to solution A. The free energy change of unfolding, DG(H2O), was determined from guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of 5H-RNase H at 10 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, and 60 °C, assuming a two-state model and a linear relationship between DG and the denaturant concentration [48].

Experimental procedures
Preparation of protein
Plasmid pJAL5H, for the overproduction of 5H-RNase HI, was previously constructed [5]. Competent cells of E. coli HB101 [F­, hsdS20(rB­, mB­), recA13, ara-13, proA2, lacY1, galK2, rpsL20(Smr), xyl-5, mtl-1, supE44, k­] were obtained from Takara Bio Inc. (Otsu, Japan). Cells were grown in LB medium [41] containing 100 mgÆL)1 ampicillin. 5H-RNase HI was overproduced in E. coli HB101 harboring plasmid pJAL5H, and purified to homogeneity as described previously [42].

Crystallization and data collection
The recombinant 5H-RNase HI was concentrated using a Centricon ultrafiltration system (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to 8.5­10.0 mgÆmL)1. The conditions were surveyed using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method at 4 °C. Drops were prepared by mixing 1 lL of protein solution and 2 lL of reservoir solution, and were vapor-equilibrated against 100 lL of reservoir solution. Native crystals of 5H-RNase HI suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis appeared after a few days using the following solution: 20 mm Tris / HCl (pH 9.0) containing 200 mm NaCl, 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 3350, and 10% glycerol.

Structure determination
X-ray diffraction datasets of the 5H-RNase HI crystal were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation on the BL38B1 station at SPring-8, using a Jupiter210 multiple imaging plates diffractometer (Rigaku, Akishima, Japan). These datasets were processed with program hkl2000 [43]. The crystal structure was solved by a molecular replacement method using molrep [44] in the ccp4 program suite. ° The refined 1.48 A structure of E. coli RNase HI (Protein Data Bank code 2RN2) was used as a starting model. Model building and refinement of the structures were completed using the programs coot [45] and refmac [46] in the CCP4 program suite. Progress in the structure refinement was evaluated at each stage by the free R-factor and by inspection of stereochemical parameters calculated by the program procheck [47].
