ABSTRACT The aminotransferase (BtrR), which is involved in the biosynthesis of butirosin, a 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS)-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Bacillus circulans, catalyses the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent transamination reaction both of 2-deoxy-scylloinosose to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine and of aminodideoxy-scyllo-inosose to 2-DOS. The high-resolution crystal structures of the PLP- and PMP-bound forms of BtrR aminotransferase from B. circulans were solved at resolutions of 2.1 Å and 1.7 Å with Rfactor/Rfree values of 17.4/20.6 and 19.9/21.9, respectively. BtrR has a fold characteristic of the aspartate aminotransferase family, and sequence and structure analysis categorises it as a member of SMAT (secondary metabolite aminotransferases) subfamily. It exists as a homodimer with two active sites per dimer. The active site of the BtrR protomer is located in a cleft between an helical N-terminus, a central sandwich domain and an Cterminal domain. The structures of the PLP- and PMP-bound enzymes are very similar; however BtrRPMP lacks the covalent bond to Lys192. Furthermore, the two forms differ in the side-chain conformations of Trp92, Asp163, and Tyr342 that are likely to be important in substrate selectivity and substrate binding. This is the first three-dimensional structure of an enzyme from the butirosin biosynthesis gene cluster. Proteins 2006;65:220 ­230.

includes many of the clinically important aminoglycosides, for example, kanamycin, neomycin, gentamicin, and butirosin (Fig. 1).1 The butirosin gene cluster has recently been identified and sequenced,2 providing the foundation for a detailed investigation of the biosynthesis of this class of aminoglycosides. In order to study the biosynthesis of the aglycone, 2-DOS, we synthesised two of the proposed intermediates 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose and 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine by a convenient route from myo-inositol.3 Using these compounds as standards we identified BtrR (also designated BtrS by Tamegai et al.4) as the aminotransferase that converts 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine, the second step of 2-DOS biosynthesis [Fig. 1(b)]. Evidence was also obtained that BtrR could catalyse the last step in the 2-DOS biosynthetic pathway, suggesting it was a doubly functional aminotransferase.5 Subsequent experiments using gene disruption studies have provided further evidence that BtrR is involved in the second transamination of 2-DOS biosynthesis.6 In this article, we describe the structures of the PLPand PMP-bound forms of BtrR solved to resolutions of 2.1 Å and 1.7 Å respectively, and we analyze possible substrate and inhibitor binding. The structures reveal that BtrR has a fold characteristic of the aspartate aminotransferase family and is a member of the new class of aminotransferases that function primarily in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (SMAT).

These molecules comprise a significant component of our antimicrobial arsenal and, like all antibiotics, are under pressure from the spread of resistance. They are classified into two groups depending on the structure of the aglycone. One class, which includes streptomycin and fortimicin, is characterized by a fully substituted aminocyclitol streptamine. The other has 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) as the common aglycone and

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sequence Analysis The sequence of BtrR was compared with protein sequences deposited in SWISS-PROT by using the Blast v2.2 program.7 Homologous proteins with known structures were identified using the FUGUE8 homology recognition server. Protein Expression and Purification PLP-bound and PMP-bound forms The btrR gene was amplified by PCR from Bacillus circulans genomic DNA and cloned into a pET28 expression vector (Novagen) with six N-terminal His tags and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells.9 The cells harboring the btrR/pET28 plasmid were grown overnight in 10 mL LB broth in the presence of kanamycin (50 g/L) at 37°C. The overnight culture was inoculated into 1 L fresh LB with kanamycin and grown at 37°C until OD600nm of approximately 0.6 to 0.8 was reached. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl- D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and culture growth continued at 28°C for approximately 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, resuspended in 10 mL of binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 0.5M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9), with 0.1 mM PLP for the PLP-bound form and without PLP for PMP-bound form. The cells were disrupted by sonication (4 min with 2 s bursts and 9.9 s pauses). All steps were carried out on ice. After sonication the solution was centrifuged at 18000 rpm for 30 min to remove cell debris. The cell-free extract was applied to a Ni-NTA resin column that was charged with charging buffer, prewashed with water and binding

buffer. The column with bound proteins was washed with binding buffer and wash buffer (60 mM imidazole, 0.5M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 10%glycerol, pH 7.9) followed by elution buffer (250 mM imidazole, 0.5M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9) to elute the His-tagged protein. The eluted protein was concentrated to 2 mL using a 6 mL concentration cell (Vivaspin6, SigmaAldrich) and subjected to FPLC purification on a Superdex S-200 HiLoad 16/60-gel filtration column at 1 mL/min (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified protein was concentrated to 100 L using a 6 mL concentration cell (Vivapsin6). The PLP-bound protein was concentrated to 12 mg/mL and buffer exchanged to 250 mM NaCl, 20mM Tri-HCl, pH 8.0. The PMP-bound protein in 20 mM Tris-HCl and 100 mM KCl at pH7.5 was concentrated to 10 mg/mL. Both samples were used for crystallization trials. Crystallization and X-Ray Data Collection The crystallization drops normally contained 1 L of protein solution mixed with 1 L of crystallisation solution and were equilibrated against 1 mL of the latter in 24-well plates (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) at room temperature of 19°C. In both cases, the initial crystallisation trials were performed with sparse crystallization matrices. The PLPbound form produced microcrystals in condition #26 of Hampton Research Corp., Crystal Screen IITM. The crystallization condition was slightly modified by varying the concentrations of crystallizing agents, and this yielded crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis. The best crystals were bi-pyramidal in shape and grew in 0.1M ammonium sulphate, 15% PEG5000, and 50 mM MES at pH 6.5. In contrast, the PMP-bound form generated just a

few crystals in condition #26 of Molecular Dimensions Ltd., Structure Screen I that were already suitable for the X-ray diffraction analysis without any need of further optimization of crystallization conditions. The corresponding crystallization condition formulation is 0.8M K, Na tartrate tetrahydrate, and 0.1M Na HEPES at pH 7.5. The fully grown crystals of both forms of BtrR were soaked for 5 to 10 s in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 26% to 28% of ethylene glycol together with the mother liquor as defined by the crystallization conditions, mounted into the cryo-loops (Hampton Research, Ltd) and then either placed into the liquid nitrogen or into the stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K provided by the CryoStream device (Oxford Instruments, Ltd.). X-ray diffraction data collection experiments were performed at cryogenic temperature using either an in-house copper-rotating anode (generator RU-H3R, Rigaku-MSC Ltd. equipped with MaxFlux confocal multilayer optics, Osmic Inc.) or synchrotron (beam station PX 9.6 of Daresbury SRS, Warrington, UK) radiation sources. The diffraction data were recorded using either Raxis IV image plate (Rigaku-MCS Ltd.) or Quantum4 CCD (Area Detector Systems Corp.) detectors. In all cases, the raw diffraction data were collected using a single crystal at 1° oscillation steps and were indexed, integrated, scaled, and reduced using HKL diffraction data processing suite10 with the use of various crystallographic programs from the CCP4 suite11 for all subsequent calculations. Structure Solution and Refinement Calculation of Matthews' coefficient11 suggested the presence of one molecule of BtrR in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of approximately 50%. Initially, the structure of the PLP-bound form of BtrR was determined by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of AHBA synthase (PDB accession code: 1b9h) as the search probe. AHBA shares 29% sequence identity with BtrR over a stretch of 416 of residues used in the molecular replacement study and is the closest homologue of known structure. Molecular replacement calculations were performed using AMoRe program.12 The rotation function produced a peak with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.7 (resolution range 8 ­3 Å was used for all calculations). This solution produced a clear peak in the translation function with a correlation coefficient and Rcryst between observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes of 25.4% and 54.9%, respectively. The rigid body refinement performed in AMoRe improved both the correlation coefficient and the Rfactor to 37% and 52.7%, respectively, thus confirming the correctness of the solution. Subsequently, the structure of PMP-bound form was also determined by the molecular replacement. However, in this case the refined structure of the PLP-bound form of BtrR, without the bound cofactor was used as the search probe. The initial model thus obtained was then subjected to several rounds of crystallographic refinement and manual rebuilding. The atomic coordinates were refined using CNS.13 Simulated annealing protocols as implemented in CNS were utilized in the first rounds of refinement and

replaced by the Powell minimization protocol in the last rounds. The temperature factor refinement included the restrained individual Bfactor refinement. Manual rebuilding was performed in XtalView suite14 using sigmaA weighted 2Fo-Fc, Fo-Fc and annealed omit maps. An automated model-rebuilding program ARP/WARP15 was also employed in the early stages of refinement to aid the manual rebuilding procedure. Most water molecules were picked using the XtalView internal subroutine and additional ones were placed manually using the following criteria: a peak of at least 2.5 for a Fo-Fc map, a peak of at least 1 for a 2Fo-Fc map, and reasonable intermolecular interactions. The PLP or PMP molecules were included only in the last stages of refinement. Small Molecule Docking A three-dimensional model of the 2DOI (2-deoxy-scylloinosose) substrate was built in silico and minimized. The molecule of 2DOI was docked into the refined structure of BtrR-PMP and covalently linked to the PMP. The docking was conducted using InsightII, a molecular modeling tool (Accelrys). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Sequence Analysis of BtrR PSI-BLAST searches of protein sequences in SWISSPROT identified BtrR as a member of the aspartate aminotransferase family, a major group of enzymes that belong to the superfamily of PLP-dependent enzymes. The enzymes of this superfamily catalyse a diverse range of chemical reactions including transamination, decarboxylation, and racemization. The closest homologues of BtrR are aminotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and streptomycin. These enzymes are members of the DegT/DnrJ/EryC1/StrS aminotransferase family (Pfam accession code: PF01041) whose members are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and are known as secondary metabolite aminotransferases (SMATs) subfamily. SMATs were originally characterised through studies of stsC, the gene encoding the L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase from streptomycin-producing Streptomycetes.16 Sequence alignments revealed conserved sequence motifs that distantly resembled those in the family of aspartate aminotransferases with a conserved lysine residue. With the exception of lysine that is strictly conserved in all PLP-dependent enzymes, the motif characteristic for aspartate aminotransferases family (PROSITE PS00105: GS-LIVMFYTACGSTA-K-x2-GSALVN-LIVMFA-x-GNAR-x-R-LIVMA-GA) is not conserved in SMATs subfamily. However, analysis of SMAT enzyme sequences identified motif G-D-E-x77-E-Dx10-G-x3-G-x8-S-x4-K-x5-6-(E,Q)-G-G that is strictly conserved amongst the members of SMATs.16 This motif is conserved in BtrR and it therefore categorizes the enzyme as a member of the SMAT subfamily. This is confirmed by sequence-structure comparisons. FUGUE identified two high-resolution structures for subfamily members: 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA)

synthase from Amycolatopsis mediterranei and ArnB aminotransferase from Salmonella typhimurium. AHBA (PDB code: 1B9H) is the homologue of known structure with highest percentage sequence identity (29% PID) to BtrR. The sequences of AHBA synthase and BtrR are not too dissimilar in regions away from the active site. However, the central cofactor-binding regions align best around the conserved lysine that covalently binds the PLP cofactor. Structure Determination for BtrR Crystallization of the PLP-bound and PMP-bound forms yielded trigonal bipyramidal crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystals of PLP bound form usually appeared after 1 to 2 days and reached their maximum dimensions of 0.25 0.2 0.2 mm3 in 2 weeks. In contrast the crystals of PMP bound form grew to 0.3

0.2 mm3 in 7 days. The crystals of PLP-bound 0.3 enzyme diffracted to a resolution of 2.1Å, whereas crystals of PMP-bound form diffracted to 1.7Å. The crystallographic data collection statistics are given in Table I. The refined model of the BtrR-PLP yielded a Rfactor of 17.4 and Rfree 20.6 for all data to 2.1 Å. In addition, the BtrR with PMP yielded an Rfactor of 19.9 and Rfree 21.9 for all data to 1.7Å (Table I). The final models contain 365 and 362 amino acid residues and 394 and 396 ordered water molecules, respectively, in addition to one cofactor molecule per protomer. The structures contain a cis-proline at residue 12. Analyses by PROCHECK17 showed that all residues have expected allowed conformations, except F140 an amino acid that is 9Å away from the active site cofactor and it is present in the active site cavity. It could perhaps be involved in catalysis.

ing that AHBA synthase is a closer homologue than ArnB aminotransferase. When the large cofactor-binding domains are overlaid it is observed that the orientations of the C-terminal domains differ. In addition, the C-terminal domains differ in their arrangement of -strands, -helices, and loops. Together these differences are likely to contribute to the specificity for the substrate and reaction type. Binding and Comparison between PLP- and PMPBound Forms

Overview of the BtrR Structure The BtrR structure has the characteristic aspartate aminotransferase fold consisting of three distinct regions, an N-terminal domain, a central cofactor-binding domain and a C-terminal domain. The cofactor binds at the interface of the central and C-terminal domains (Fig. 2). The asymmetric unit of BtrR contains one protomer of the enzyme, and a crystallographic two-fold axis generates a dimer that has many close contacts between the subunits, especially at the active site (Fig. 3). The dimer interface consists of 80 residues including 36 hydrogen bonds and buries an extensive, predominantly hydrophobic interface area of 3000 Å.2 The observation of a dimer in the crystal structure is in agreement with the finding that BtrR behaves as a functional dimer in solution. Together these observations provide strong evidence that the enzyme functions as a dimer. The majority of the aspartate aminotransferases exist as similar dimers18 ­23 and the hydrophobic nature of the interface is conserved, although the individual residues are not. The C RMSDs for BtrR when superimposed with AHBA synthase (PDB:1B9H) and ArnB aminotransferase (PDB:1MDO) are 1.08 Å and 2.00 Å respectively, confirmPROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

The resting state of BtrR, in the absence of substrate, contains PLP bound through an imine to Lys192. The conversion of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine and of amino-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose to 2-DOS catalyzed by BtrR proceeds by two half-reactions. First, PLP reacts with glutamic acid to form PMP and -ketoglutarate. Second, PMP reacts with either 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose or amino-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose to yield the respective aminated product and regenerate PLP bound to BtrR. Comparison of the two three-dimensional structures reported here shows that the binding interactions of PLP and PMP to BtrR aminotransferase are very similar, but PMP, unlike PLP, is not covalently bound to Lys192 (Fig. 4). Other than this, all of the interactions of the cofactor with the enzyme are virtually the same with both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions being important. The cofactor is situated in the central groove of each protomer (Fig. 2) as in homologous aspartate aminotransferases.18 Figures 3 and 5 show that the N termini of 3 and 4 as well as 8 (from protomer B) and 10 provide the scaffold for the cofactor binding while the connecting loops 187 to 200 and 166 to 171 mediate the binding of PLP and PMP. In helix 3, Gly66 NH and Ser67 NH and OH coordinate the phosphate moiety of PMP by binding O2P and O1P, respectively. The phosphate oxygen O2P is also hydrogen bonded to a water molecule and the last residue of 8, Ser187 OH. The phosphate O1P is also hydrogen bonded to a water molecule. Asp163 OH of 10 interacts with the N1 of the PMP pyrimidine ring. In addition, Gln166 NH2 is interacting with the O3 from PMP and two

water molecules. In summary, residues Gly66, Ser67, Asp163, Gln166, and Ser187 and a network of water molecules mediate hydrogen-bonding interactions with the bound PMP. Additionally, mainly hydrophobic interactions are provided by Trp92, Val137, Ala94, Leu70, and Ala165 [Fig. 4(b)]. PLP, like PMP, is bound by hydrogen bonds that are mediated by residues Gly66, Ser67, Asp163, Gln166, Ser187, but also has a covalent bond to Lys192. As in the

PMP structure, Trp92, Val137 and Ala165 provide mainly hydrophobic interactions [Fig. 4(a)]. Although PLP- and PMP-BtrR structures are very similar, there are subtle differences between the two, particularly in the positions and orientations of the side chains of Trp92, Tyr342, and Asp163. Upon PLP to PMP conversion the Trp92 ring undergoes a 45° flip around C -C , the cofactor tilts by 30° towards Trp92 and Asp163 flips its side-chain around 1 C -C by 15° away from the cofactor (Fig. 4).

Soaking and Inhibitor Studies Soaking of the PLP form of BtrR crystals with either the substrate 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine or inhibitors of PLP-dependent aminotransferases, such as gabaculin (3-amino-2,3-dihydrobenzoic acid) and (amino-oxy) acetic acid, resulted in the enzyme turning over rather than forming an enzyme substrate/inhibitor complex. While neither substrate nor inhibitors can be seen in the electron density, the structures show that BtrR is in the PMP-bound form after soaking with these three compounds. Although the enzyme is an aminotransferase, it is an atypical aminotransferase because it is not inhibited with classical inhibitors such as gabaculine. In order to investigate possible substrate binding, structures of the BtrR homologue -- AHBA synthase with gabaculine -- and BtrR were superimposed using molecular superimposition software, COMPARER25 (Fig. 5). Superposition of the structures demonstrates that the pocket occupied by a sulphate ion in BtrR-PLP is equivalent to the pocket occupied by gabaculine in AHBA synthase, suggesting that this is the putative substrate-binding site. Furthermore, the superposition suggests that Gln189 and Trp92 in BtrR play a role in substrate binding, and possibly in substrate specificity because they are not conserved in the subfamily (Fig. 5). The sulphate ion is hydrogen bonded in the BtrR-PLP structure via residues Trp92, Tyr304, and a water molecule [Fig. 5(b)]. Phe140 and His339 are also within 4 Å of the sulphate ion, lining the groove within which it lies. The Tyr342 that is not visible in BtrR-PLP but present in BtrR-PMP structure is also within the hydrogen bonding distance of the sulphate ion, suggesting its involvement in substrate binding. It is possible that these residues are involved in coordinating the substrate through hydrogen bonding interactions. In Silico Substrate Docking To analyze possible substrate binding, the 2DOI molecule was manually docked into the pocket where the sulphate ion

addition, the PLP bound form shows no electron density for the side-chain Tyr342 [Fig. 4(b)]. The conformational changes of Trp92, Asp163, and Tyr342 could be concerted with the tilting of the cofactor and possibly with accommodation of the substrate. The residues that are conserved between aspartate aminotransferases are in the cofactor-binding region and include the catalytic Lys192, Asp163, and Ala165 (Fig. 7). Ala165 together with Trp92 provide stacking interactions on either face of the pyridoxal ring. The residues that are conserved in the SMAT subfamily are Val137 and Ser187, which provide the cofactor with hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions (Fig. 4). Gln166 is not conserved but has previously been identified as important in determining the reaction pathway of the SMATs.24 In BtrR it plays a role in cofactor binding, but its role in catalysis still needs to be confirmed.

is found in the crystal structure of BtrR and a covalent bond was created between PMP and 2DOI, simulating the intermediate in the catalytic mechanism. To achieve binding of the intermediate, the side-chain of Trp92 would have to flip creating access to the cofactor so that the substrate could bind, as observed in BtrR-PMP structure. The volume of the putative BtrR active site is 690 Å (as calculated by castP26). On docking it is clear that the proposed binding site can accommodate the substrate 2DOI and the binding site is lined with residues that could interact with the substrate (Fig. 6). The residues that are within 3 Å of 2DOI are Trp92, Tyr304, Tyr342, and Gln166 [Fig. 6(b)]. All the residues except Gln166 were previously identified on superimposition with gabaculine-AHBA synthase. BtrR accepts four different carbocyclic substrates, 2-deoxyscyllo-inosose, 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine, amino-dideoxyscyllo-inosose, and 2-deoxysteptamine, requiring the binding site in the enzyme to have some flexibility. It is interesting that BtrR combines this flexibility with high specificity because the enzyme has been shown to distinguish between the enantiotopic amino groups of DOS.6 Because a triol is a conserved feature in all these compounds it seems possible that selective binding is affected primarily by hydrogenbonding to these hydroxy groups. In particular, these three hydroxyl groups of the substrates could be bound by Tyr304 OH, Tyr342 OH, and Gln166 NH2 of BtrR [Fig. 6(b)]. This could explain how BtrR can bind different substrates but retain high specificity. Furthermore, binding of glutamic acid as the second substrate in catalysis of BtrR is not incompatible with this model. Putative Active Site The electron sink nature of the cofactor is enhanced by a close interaction of the pyridinium nitrogen with an aspartate residue (Asp163), which acts to maintain the cofactor in the protonated form. The displaced Schiff base lysine residue (Lys192) is positioned to transfer proton to and from C and C4 . Because the substrate of BtrR -- L-glutamate -- cannot undergo - or - elimination, the primary side reaction that must be minimized is racemization. This could be achieved by closure of the enzyme active site around the substrate, so that the solvent water molecules do not access the quinonoid intermediate.29 However, in the structures of BtrR-PMP and BtrR-PLP no large-scale rearrangements between the structures were observed. In a similar way, no large-scale rearrangements between PMP and PLP structures were observed either in ArnB aminotransferase, which was cocrystallized with -ketoglutarate and soaked with Lcycloserine,30 or in AHBA synthase, which was cocrystallized with gabaculine.18 Additionally, the binding of inhibitors caused only small changes at the active site and dimer interface with the overall tertiary structure remaining essentially unchanged. It is possible that BtrR aminotransferase behaves in a similar way. The four types of PLP-dependent enzymes do not have a common fold but there is a limited conservation of the PLP binding residues. The type I fold (aspartate aminotransferase family) consists of large sandwich and small domains. Type I enzymes have been divided into sub-

groups on the basis of conformational changes upon the binding of substrate or inhibitors: subgroup Ia, large conformational changes; subgroup Ib, absence of conformational changes. Although it is not clear if the possible conformational changes contribute to substrate specificity, the existence of the closed conformation certainly contributes to reaction type specificity within the aspartate aminotransferase family.32 Even though the BtrR-substrate complex structure is unavailable all the structures produced by turning over of substrate and inhibitors that were solved showed no conformational change. The crystal structures of BtrR and its comparison to SMAT subfamily perhaps suggest that this enzyme belongs to the subgroup Ib rather than to Ia.31 Although it is possible that the enzyme belongs to the type Ib subgroup, the evidence form the structures is insufficient to draw this conclusion. The basis for the dual specificity of aminotransferases has been elucidated by recent structural studies. Because the aminotransferase reaction requires two different substrates to bind in succession to the same cofactor active site, these enzymes must be able to accommodate both structures and discriminate against all others. One possible way of achieving this is by cofactor movement between the two different binding sites but such movement has never been observed. An alternative is to position the functional groups of the substrates into exclusive binding sites.32 Most known aminotransferases adopt strategies for binding both substrates in the same site and this is also likely for BtrR not least because the volume of active site cavity is considerable. Because BtrR, like many other aminotransferases, uses the common substrate glutamate, the problem of dual specificity is generally that of accommodating the negatively charged -carboxylate of glutamate in the same site that must also accept a neutral or positively charged side-chain. Comparison of BtrR with ArnB aminotransferase identified residues that could be determinants of L-glutamine selectivity in BtrR. The presence of -ketoglutarate product in the ArnB structure allowed the identification of residues involved in the binding. The side-chain of Lys241 from the opposite protomer was found hydrogen bonded to the terminal carboxyl group of -ketoglutarate whilst the guanido group of Arg229 also from the opposite protomer was found hydrogen bonded to the -carboxylate of -ketoglutarate.30 In the structure of BtrR the equivalent residues to Lys241B and Arg229B of ArnB are Met235B and Asn247B. Together, Met235B and Asn247B could constitute the selectivity filter for the amino donor -- Lglutamate -- of BtrR aminotransferase (Fig. 7). The proposed absence of large conformational change between active and inactive BtrR forms and the absence of arginine residues in the active site cavity -- preventing an arginine switch mechanism32 -- suggest that the mechanism of this enzyme is mediated by subtle rearrangements of hydrogen bonding network in the active site. CONCLUSION Multiple scaffolds have evolved to bind PLP and to assist in catalysis. In no case does the fold type dictate reaction

type, as each fold type catalyses multiple reaction types. Recently the number of PLP-dependent enzyme structures determined has increased significantly allowing comparisons and further assessments of how different protein scaffolds may be used in binding a common cofactor but catalyzing diverse reactions. BtrR aminotransferase is a functional dimer with one active site per protomer where both protomers are involved in contributing to the active site. The enzyme shows closest structural similarity to the aspartate aminotransferase family within the superfamily of PLP-dependent enzymes. Here we show that the BtrR enzyme should be assigned as a member of the secondary metabolite aminotransferase subfamily. On analysis of cofactor and substrate binding we have identified residues that might be important in substrate binding and catalysis, such as Trp92, Tyr304, Tyr342 and the catalytic loops containing Ser187, Gln189, Q166 and Lys192. From subfamily analysis and small molecule docking of 2DOI some of the observations above were verified and additional residues identified that could play a part in L-glutamine amino donor substrate selectivity, such as residues Met235B and Asn247B. The structure reported here, for the dual functional aminotransferase BtrR, is the first for an enzyme from the 2-DOS biosynthetic pathway. This provides an initial step towards the detailed structural investigation of the enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of this class of aminoglycosides.
