An RNA helix with seven base pairs which was derived from the acceptor stem of Escherichia coli tRNAAla, rGGGGCUAÁrUAGCUCC (ALAwt), as well as a variant, rGGGGCUAÁrUAGCCCC (ALAC70), in which the single GÁU wobble base pair of ALAwt was replaced by GÁC, crystallize in space group C2. Both non-isomorphic crystal forms display a complex packing pattern, which can be described alternatively as disorder or pseudo-merohedral twinning. The structure of ALAwt was determined by SIRAS phasing using an isomorphous iodine derivative, rGGGGCi5UAÁrUAGCUCC (ALAI). All three RNA structures were subsequently subjected to twin re®nement in space group P1, using anisotropic thermal displacement parameters Ê at resolutions of 1.16, 1.23 and 1.4 A for ALAwt, ALAI and C70 ALA , respectively. Alternatively, the structure of ALAwt was re®ned in space group C2 assuming twofold disorder of the molecular orientation. The re®ned structures are of reasonable quality according to all available indicators. There are no systematic differences between the molecular models resulting from twin re®nement and disorder re®nement.

1. Introduction
Microhelices derived from the acceptor stem of Escherichia coli tRNAAla containing seven base pairs and a full A±C±C±A end are speci®cally aminoacylated by the cognate tRNA synthetase (Francklyn & Schimmel, 1989; Schimmel, 1993). Therefore, these small RNA fragments provide a unique opportunity to study at high resolution the structural features of an RNA double helix which are speci®cally recognized by a protein. The signi®cance of these studies is underscored by in vivo and in vitro studies showing that the determinants for speci®c binding by alanyl-tRNA synthetase are located primarily in the acceptor stem of tRNAAla (McClain & Foss, 1988; Hou & Schimmel, 1988) and that the G3ÁU70 wobble base pair is of prime importance for the recognition process (Musier-Forsyth et al., 1991, 1995; Beuning et al., 1997). Two independent NMR studies of acceptor stem-derived microhelices (Limmer et al., 1996; Ramos & Varani, 1997) have attempted to identify structural irregularities which might serve as identity elements for tRNAAla. More recently, we have determined the crystal structures of the synthetic acceptor stem which lacks the A±C±C±A end, rGGGGCUAÁrUAGCUCC (ALAwt) and its G3ÁC70 variant, rGGGGCUAÁrUAGCCCC (ALAC70), at near-atomic resoluÊ tions of 1.16 and 1.4 A, respectively (Mueller et al., 1999). This analysis showed that the G3ÁU70 wobble base pair does not induce a signi®cant global conformational change in the acceptor helix.

The crystal structures of ALAwt and ALAC70 were re®ned as pseudo-merohedral twins in space group P1 (Mueller et al., 1999). Pseudo-merohedral twinning may occur in crystals with unusual unit-cell geometry which produces a lattice with a pseudosymmetry higher than the point-group symmetry (Yeates, 1997), e.g. a triclinic cell with two edges and two

Merohedral twinning and twin re®nement is not uncommon in protein structures (Carr et al., 1996; Luecke et al., 1998; Valegard et al., 1998) but, to the best of our knowledge, has never been described for crystal structures of nucleic acid fragments where, however, cases of disorder have been reported (e.g. Brennan et al., 1986; Shah & È Brunger, 1999). Here, we describe the X-ray analysis of the ALA helices by SIRAS phasing using the disordered single-site iodine derivative rGGGGCi5UAÁrUAGCUCC (ALAI) and compare alternative re®nements of the RNA structure using disorder and twin models. The physical signi®cance of the two models and relevant aspects of crystal packing in ALAwt and ALAC70 are discussed. Since synthetic nucleic acid fragments particularly lend themselves to the type of lattice disorder found here, this discussion may be of more general interest.

In order to prevent photolytic cleavage, the iodinated sample was stored in the dark. For crystallization using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 293 K, 1.5 ml of 0.5 mM ALAI duplex was mixed with 1.5 ml of a crystallization buffer consisting of 40 mM sodium cacodylate pH 6.0, 12 mM spermine tetra-HCl, 80 mM SrCl2, 40 mM LiCl and 10%(v/v) 2-methyl 2,4-pentanediol (MPD), exploiting the screen described by Berger et al. (1996). Equilibrating the droplet against a reservoir of 35%(v/v) MPD gave small crystals with dimensions of 150 Â 80 Â 50 mm after 48 h. Similar to the large crystals of ALAwt, these crystals have a clear morphology without any indication of disorder or twinning.

Even at the resolution limit, all re¯ection pro®les are clean, showing no indication whatsoever of splitting which might arise from non-merohedral twinning. When reducing the high-resolution data in space group P1 (see below), the completeness is 83.1% with an overall Rsym of 8.7% (resoluÊ tion shell 1.24±1.23 A, Rsym = 25.0%). In Table 2, the highI resolution ALA data set is compared with those for ALAwt and ALAC70 (Mueller et al., 1999).

To our surprise, the map revealed that two heptamers are arranged such that within each RNA heptamer the molecular pseudo-dyad relating the two non-identical strands in the RNA duplex coincides with a crystallographic twofold axis (see Fig. 8). That is, the ALAwt (and ALAI) duplexes do not occupy the four general positions of space group C2, but instead we ®nd two independent copies of the RNA on the two special positions.

3.3. Twin re®nement of the ALA helices

At this stage, the possibility of a more convenient description of the crystal by twinning was investigated. Here, the two alternative orientations of the RNA duplexes would not result from local disorder but would arise from the presence of two separate twin domains with different orientations in the crystal. In the case of wt I pseudo-merohedral twinning (Yeates, 1997; Ê Ê Ê ² Resolution shells 15±1.16/1.17±1.16 A for ALA , 15±1.23/1.24±1.23 A for ALA and 15±1.40/1.45±1.40 A for  ³ I, re¯ection intensity. § Rsym = ALAC70. hYi jIhYi À Ih ja hYi IhYi , where the summation is over all Herbst-Irmer & Sheldrick, 1998; Yeates & È observations Ih,i contributing to the re¯ection intensities Ih. } Rfree (Brunger, 1992) based on 5% of the data Fam, 1999), which is the only possibility selected from thin resolution shells with DATAMAN (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996). ²² Root-mean-square deviation, here with respect to the RNA library obtained from http://ndb-mirror-2.rutgers.edu/NDB/archives/proj/ here, the diffraction pattern of the two standards.html. ³³ Estimated standard deviation for RNA atoms from least-squares matrix. distinct twin domains superimposes perfectly, resulting in a diffraction pattern of higher Laue symmetry than the underwhich are related by a crystallographic twofold axis.

The relationship between the monoclinic C2 unit cell and the triclinic P1 cell is given in Fig. 4. 3.2. Disorder re®nement of ALAwt In order to investigate the twin model, all data sets were reThe re®nement of ALAwt was performed with SHELXL97 evaluated in space group P1 (see Table 2). Special care was (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) with the disorder model, using taken to maintain a consistent indexing of the different the `PART -1' option to turn off restraints on the symmetryimages.

The re®nement against differences in the Rsym values (see Tables 1 and 2) are a Ê consequence of the individual data-reduction protocols, using 12 611 independent structure-factor amplitudes to 1.16 A SCALA/AGROVATA/TRUNCATE (Collaborative Compuresolution, with subsequent modelling of 50 fully occupied tational Project, Number 4, 1994) for the C2 data and solvent sites including one Sr2+ cation, led to a crystallographic R value of 22.1% (Rfree = 27.6% for 5% of the data omitted SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) combined with È from re®nement according to Brunger, 1992).

from the coordinate set and resetting the displacement paraÊ meters to isotropic B values of 20 A2, the ®rst re®nement cycle Ê using data from 15 to 2.0 A led to R and Rfree of 28.4 and 30.7%, respectively. Stepwise extension of the data to the Ê resolution limit of 1.23 A, together with the modelling of 69 water sites, let the isotropic re®nement converge at R and Rfree of 20.1 and 22.9%, respectively. Restrained anisotropic Bfactor re®nement of all atoms reduced R and Rfree to 16.7 and 21.4%, respectively. Subsequent completion of the hydration model to include 155 water sites, one Sr2+ and one Na+ let the twin re®nement of ALAI converge at R and Rfree of 12.7 and 19.3%, respectively. The last cycle of re®nement including the test set yielded an R of 12.9%. For comparison, the ®nal model of ALAwt consists of 586 RNA atoms, 149 waters, one Sr2+ and one Na+, and the ®nal crystallographic R factor is 12.4% (Rfree = 18.0%).

The re®ned structures of the two heptamer duplexes of ALAI are nearly identical to those of the ALAwt duplexes. After superimposing all RNA atoms in equivalent duplexes of Ê ALAI and ALAwt, r.m.s.d. values of 0.169 and 0.210 A, respectively, are obtained. Owing to different packing envir-

The twin law derived for space group P1 and expressed in reciprocal space as I(h, k, l)  I(Àh, Àl, Àk) is equivalent to the crystallographic twofold axis along the b axis of the C2 cell. In the case of ALAC70, the same relationship applies; however, the order of the P1 axes is permutated. Here, the monoclinic c axis is collinear with the triclinic c axis. The twin law is expressed as I(h, k, l)  I(Àk, Àh, Àl).

onments, the two crystallographically independent ALAI Ê molecules differ from each other with an r.m.s.d. of 0.851 A. In spite of this, the two duplexes show overall A-form geometry, with an average helical twist value of 32.7 or 31.5 , mean rise Ê values of 2.85 A for both helices, inclination values from 8.1 to  10.6 and displacement values of the base pairs between 3.6 Ê and 4.4 A with respect to a curved global helical axis. Additionally, all 28 riboses adopt the C3H -endo conformation. Obviously, the I atom which is bound to C5 of U6 has no measurable in¯uence on the helical geometry. The I atoms point straight into the major groove of the duplexes and are Ê 3.6±3.8 A away from the O2P atom of the same residue. The pyrimidine ring of the C5 residue displays a nearly complete intrastrand overlap with the I atom of U6. This interaction does not require any departure from standard A-type helix geometry.
3.5. Comparison of the disorder and twin models of ALAwt

The two independent molecules of ALAwt representing either the disorder model (dALAwt-A and dALAwt-B) or the twin model of the tRNAAla microhelix (tALAwt-A and tALAwt-B; Mueller et al., 1999) were compared in order to assess the effects of the different re®nement strategies and the in¯uence of crystal-lattice contacts on the double helical structures (Fig. 5). Least-squares superpositions of dALAwt-A and dALAwt-B and of tALAwt-A and tALAwt-B using all Ê RNA atoms yielded r.m.s.d. values of 0.922 and 0.883 A, respectively. Thus, the different crystal environments of the duplexes cause signi®cant conformational differences in each re®nement protocol. A comparison of the equivalent duplexes dALAwt-A and tALAwt-A or dALAwt-B and tALAwt-B yields Ê smaller r.m.s.d. values of 0.242 or 0.234 A, respectively. Obviously, the conformational differences arising from the

different descriptions of the crystal are much smaller than those resulting from crystal packing. Considering the mean Ê coordinate e.s.d. of 0.039 A (see Table 2), however, these differences are still signi®cant. They correspond to small differences in the R values and in the number of modelled solvent sites and may be caused by slight variations in the computational procedures employed in data processing and re®nement. Nevertheless, the atomic models are of satisfactory quality as outlined above and in Table 2 and indicated by the electron density. The GÁU wobble base pair of the tRNAAla acceptor stem shows a distinct hydration pattern (Fig. 6) which is indicated by clear density in all models of ALAwt and ALAI, whether produced by disorder or by twin re®nement. Ê Furthermore, at the resolution of 1.16 A the density permits the unambiguous discrimination between carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and, of course, phosphorus in most parts of the ALAwt double helix, as shown in Fig. 7. This ®gure also shows qualitatively how the electron-density levels correspond to the anisotropic displacement parameters: atoms with higher density have smaller 50% probability ellipsoids than atoms with lower density; see, for example, the pairs O2H /O3H , O4/O2 and N1/N3.
3.6. Crystal packing of ALAwt, ALAI and ALAC70

It is remarkable that a disordered or twinned crystal lattice is observed for all ALA helices, although the packing of the ALAwt and ALAI duplexes in their isomorphous unit cells differs from the packing of ALAC70 in its non-isomorphous cell. These can be appreciated when considering the packing within the disordered C2 cell (Fig. 8). The crystals of ALAwt, ALAI and ALAC70 are characterized by the stacking of heptameric duplex RNA molecules forming long quasicontinuous double helices. Along the helix axes, pseudo-

twofold axes relating the two non-identical strands of the duplex alternate with twofold axes located between duplex molecules. Because these two types of twofold axes are oriented roughly perpendicular to each other, the symmetry of the quasi-continuous helices can be described as pseudo-2122, with the 21 screw axis coinciding with the helix axis. Perfect 2122 symmetry would only be observed if both strands of the RNA duplex were identical. However, for RNA heptamers this cannot be achieved without violating Watson±Crick basepair formation. The crystal packing of ALAwt and ALAI differs from that of ALAC70 in the arrangement of the dyad and pseudo-dyad axes with respect to the heptamer helices. In ALAC70, the quasicontinuous helices are oriented such that the twofold axes which relate different duplex molecules coincide with the crystallographic twofold axes (Fig. 8b), but disorder (or twinning) arises from non-crystallographic dyads superimposing two copies of the duplexes which occupy general positions in the C2 cell. However, in the cases of ALAwt and ALAI, the crystallographic twofold axes coincide with the pseudo-twofold axes relating the non-identical strands within the duplex, thus requiring the description of these crystals with either a disorder or twinning model (Fig. 8a). The helical repeat of the in®nite RNA helices consists of two duplex molecules, thus resulting in the stacking of 14 base pairs. However, within the duplex molecules, almost ideal A-form RNA is observed (helical repeat 9 11 bp, average twist angle 9 32.7 ). As a consequence, negative twist angles of about À16 are required for the two intermolecular basepair stacking steps present in a single helical turn. These relatively weak stacking interactions may in part explain the propensity of heptamer duplexes for disorder/twinning. Six base-pair A-form duplexes can form more rigid quasicontinuous rods by just a slight underwinding leading to a 12 bp repeat, whereas 8 bp duplexes cannot form these rods at all and tend to pack with their terminal base pairs into the shallow groove of neighbouring helices in crystal lattices (Wahl & Sundaralingam, 1997). Our observation of further examples of disorder/twinning in RNA heptamers crystallizing in unrelated monoclinic or rhombohedral space groups (Mueller et al., unpublished work) lends support to this view. As required for local disorder, both crystal packings are characterized by the almost complete absence of sequencespeci®c packing contacts. Whereas in ALAC70 no crystal packing contacts can be observed which directly involve the bases, in ALAwt and ALAI two such contacts are present, one of these including the wobble base pair (see Fig. 6). However, these contacts are not expected to prevent local disorder, because identical nucleotides are present at these positions when considering the alternative orientation of the duplex. group C2 on the basis of local disorder and that at a later stage the duplex RNA heptamers were re®ned to convergence assuming pseudo-merohedral twinning. Although in real space both treatments result in very similar ®nal atomic models, the different descriptions should be distinguishable in reciprocal

space. In a disordered lattice, all atoms contribute to the overall scattering of the crystal (although with occupancies different from unity), the resulting structure factors being the vector sum of the individual atomic structure factors. In case of pseudo-merohedral twinning, this only holds true for the individual separate twin domains. The resulting structurefactor amplitudes equal the algebraic addition of the structure-factor amplitudes from the individual twin domains. Thus, the two models generate different intensity distribution pro®les, and all standard methods used in detecting merohedral twinning take advantage of this (Stanley, 1972; Rees, 1980; Yeates, 1997; Herbst-Irmer & Sheldrick, 1998). Standard tests for ALAwt, ALAI and ALAC70 suggest that the crystals are not twinned. For ALAwt, ALAI and ALAC70, h|E2 À 1|i >> 0.736 for acentric re¯ections, 0.736 being the value which should not be exceeded for twinned data (Yeates, 1997). In addition, their ratios of hI2i/hIi2 are 2.13, 1.98 and 2.66, respectively, for acentric re¯ections, again indicating the absence of twinning. The strongest argument against the presence of pseudo-merohedral twinning results from the observed isomorphous as well as anomalous Patterson maps. The Patterson maps observed can be interpreted unambiguously in space group C2 with two heavy-atom positions (see Fig. 1), and all expected Harker vectors and cross vectors are present. Model calculations were performed in order to determine the shape of the Patterson map assuming a pseudomerohedral twinning model. To this end, the coordinates of the two iodine positions in the C2 cell of ALAI were transformed into the P1 cell. Structure factors were calculated and twinning was introduced by averaging the amplitudes of F(h, k, l) and F(Àh, Àl, Àk) according to the twin law. The resulting amplitudes were reindexed in space group C2 and a Patterson map was calculated. As expected, the resulting Patterson map is characterized by the absence of Harker vectors as well as the absence of some cross vectors, the reason for this being the absence of interference between the scattered waves of related I atoms in the twinning model. In the nontwinned case, these atoms are related by crystallographic symmetry, and their difference vectors, therefore, can be observed on the Harker plane. The observed Patterson map clearly suggests the absence of pseudomerohedral twinning. Nevertheless, re®ning the structures as pseudo-merohedral twins proved very convenient and, from the results obtained here, appears valid. The comparable R and Rfree values obtained after twin or disorder re®nement of ALAwt may be a result of the molecular pseudo-symmetry of the duplexes oriented along the crystallographic twofold axis in C2. Thus, the calculated phases for structure factors in space group P1 which are related by the twin law should not be independent. In general, twin re®nement has several advantages compared with disorder re®nement. For example, it improves the ratio of data to parameters to be re®ned (see Tables 1 and 2), thus adding stability to the re®nement process. This is indeed observed in the structure determinations described here, although the data in the true lower symmetry space group are of course strongly correlated according to the twin law. In Figure 8 practice, the distinction between twinning Crystal packing of (a) ALAwt and ALAI and (b) ALAC70 in space group C2. In case of ALAwt I and disorder of the crystal may only be of and ALA , two duplex RNA heptamers are located on special positions such that their marginal importance for the macromolecular molecular pseudo-dyads which relate the two non-identical strands within a single duplex coincide with crystallographic twofold axes. The two RNA heptamers shown are related by a structure of interest. Borderline cases non-crystallographic twofold axis located in the ac plane (arrow). In the case of ALAC70, the between lattice disorder and twinning can be duplex RNA heptamer is located between two crystallographic twofold axes. Here, the anticipated: if the twin domains become crystallographic axes relate stacked RNA molecules. In this case, the molecular pseudo-dyads small compared with the coherence length of are non-crystallographic and located in the ac plane (arrows).
