Abstract Natural killer (NK) cell function is regulated by NK receptors that bind either classical MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules or their structural relatives (MICA, RAE-1 and H-60). Two distinct families of NK receptors have been identified: the C-type lectin-like family (Ly49, NKG2D and CD94/NKG2) and the immunoglobulin-like family (KIRs and LIRs). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the C-type lectin-like NK receptor (Ly49A), bound to its MHC-I ligand (H-2Dd ). We also discuss results from recent mutagenesis studies of the Ly49A/H-2Dd interaction in the context of the complex structure. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. Introduction Natural killer (NK) cells are a fundamental component of the innate immune system that play a key role in the early stages of the immune response against virally infected and tumor cells (Long, 1999; Lanier, 2001). The cytolytic activity of NK cells is regulated through a balance of both activating and inhibitory signals mediated through distinct classes of receptors found on their surface. The dominant signal received by an NK cell through its interaction with normal levels of MHC class I (MHC-I) on target cells is inhibitory. When the level of MHC-I is reduced through infectious or tumorigenic processes, this inhibitory signal is released and the NK cell is activated. In this way, cells with abnormal MHC-I expression become the targets of NK lytic activity that results from loss of inhibition of NK cell activation. Two distinct structural families of receptors are responsible for the regulation of NK cells: the C-type lectin-like NK receptors (Ly49, NKG2D and CD94/NKG2) and the immunoglobulin-like NK receptors (KIRs and LIRs)

(Sawicki et al., 2001). These receptors recognize either classical MHC-I molecules (Ly49, CD94/NKG2, KIRs and LIRs) or MHC-I homologs, such as MICA (NKG2D). In this review, we focus on the structural basis of MHC-I recognition by Ly49 NK receptors.

2. The Ly49 family Ly49 receptors (A­W) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on mouse NK cells and on a subset of cytotoxic T-cells (Yokoyama, 1999). While the KIRs serve as the major functional NK receptor family recognizing MHC-I molecules in the human, members of the Ly49 family carry out the analogous function in the mouse. The repertoire of Ly49s expressed by an individual NK cell includes both activating and inhibitory receptors, with signal transduction through either cytoplasmic ITIMs or kinase-associated adapter molecules, such as DAP10 or DAP12, respectively (Long, 1999; Lanier, 2001). The best characterized Ly49/MHC-I interaction is that between the inhibitory Ly49A receptor and its H-2Dd ligand. The cytotoxicity of Ly49A+ NK cells is inhibited when targets express the H-2Dd molecule, either naturally or by transfection (Karlhofer et al., 1992). Using an exogenously loadable, H-2Dd -transfected, TAP-deficient cell

line as targets, it was shown that recognition of H-2Dd by Ly49A+ effectors in a killing assay was not affected by the amino acid sequence of the bound peptide (Orihuela et al., 1996). To investigate the molecular basis of the Ly49/H-2Dd interaction, recombinant soluble versions of Ly49A encoding the extracellular region have been prepared by bacterial expression and in vitro folding (Natarajan et al., 1999). As measured by surface plasmon resonance, recombinant Ly49A binds to bacterially expressed H-2Dd with a KD of approximately 10 M (Natarajan et al., 1999), irrespective of the peptide used to assemble the MHC-I molecule. This KD is similar to those reported for TCR/MHC interactions (Margulies, 1997). Although related to C-type lectins, Ly49A does not appear to require glycans for recognition, since the H-2Dd used in these experiments was unglycosylated. At 25  C, the Ly49A/H-2Dd interaction was governed by kon and koff values of 2000 M-1 s-1 and 0.03 s-1 , respectively. Ly49A failed to compete with an H-2Dd -restricted, P18-I10-specific TCR for binding to H-2Dd /P18-I10, indicating that Ly49A and TCR bind to distinct, non-overlapping sites on H-2Dd (Natarajan et al., 1999). The Ly49A/H-2Dd interaction was subsequently examined by high resolution (2.3 Å) X-ray crystallographic analysis of the corresponding complex (Tormo et al., 1999). The results of this study are summarized later. 2.1. Structure of Ly49A Murine Ly49 receptors are members of the C-type lectin-like family of NK receptors, which also includes NKG2D, CD94/NKG2, NKR-P1 and CD69 (Sawicki et al., 2001). These are homo- or heterodimeric type II transmembrane proteins, with each chain composed of an extracellular

C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) connected by a stalk region of 25­75 residues to transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. In addition to the CTLDs of NK receptors (NKDs), the CTLD superfamily of protein modules includes the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of C-type (or Ca2+ -dependent) lectins, such as mannose-binding protein (MBP) (Weis et al., 1998; Drickamer, 1999). As shown for Ly49A (Tormo et al., 1999) and NKG2D (Wolan et al., 2001) (Fig. 1), the conserved structure of the CTLDs of NK receptors consists of two -helices ( l and 2), except in CD94 where the first -helix is replaced by an extended loop (Boyington et al., 1999) and two anti-parallel -sheets formed by -strands ( 0, 1 and 5) and ( 2, 2 , 3 and 4). There are four intrachain disulfide bonds in the Ly49A NKD, two of which (C167­C253 and C232­C245) are the characteristic invariant disulfides found in C-type animal lectins, such as MBP-A (Fig. 1). The third disulfide bond (C145­C150) linking strands 0 and 1, is also present in other long-form CTLDs. The fourth disulfide bond (C163­C251), which links the N-terminus of strand 5 to the first turn of helix 1, is unique to the Ly49 family of NK receptors. In the crystal structure of the Ly49A/H-2Dd complex (Tormo et al., 1999), the MHC-binding site of Ly49A extends from loop 3 to strand 4; this region corresponds to the sugar-binding site of MBP-A (Fig. 1C). Ly49A is a homodimer at the NK cell surface, with an interchain disulfide in the stalk region which connects the transmembrane domain to the NKD (Yokoyama, 1999). The subunits hydrogen bond through their first -strand ( 0) creating one extended six-stranded anti-parallel -sheet (Fig. 2). Beneath the -sheet, the monomers associate through a central hydrophobic region formed by juxtaposition of the C-terminal ends of the 2 helices.

2.2. The Ly49A/H-2Dd complex In the crystal structure of the Ly49A/H-2Dd complex (Tormo et al., 1999), the Ly49A homodimer contacts H-2Dd through two distinct interfaces, designated sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 2). At site 1, a single Ly49A subunit binds H-2Dd on one side of the MHC-I peptide-binding platform, away from the peptide antigen. At site 2, the Ly49A dimer is wedged into a cavity beneath the peptide-binding platform of H-2Dd . The site 1 interface spans the N-terminus of helix l and the C-terminus of helix 2 of H-2Dd (Fig. 2). The total buried surface is approximately 1000 Å2 , which is considerably smaller than the average value of 1600 Å2 for protein/protein recognition sites (Lo Conte et al., 1999), but is similar to the total buried surface in the heterophilic adhesion complex between CD2 and CD58 (Wang et al., 1999). Despite its relatively small size, the site 1 interface is characterized by a precise topological match of the interacting surfaces, comparable to that found in protease/protease inhibitor complexes or at the interfaces of oligomeric proteins. This interface is highly hydrophilic and displays exquisite ionic complementarity between oppositely charged side chains on each protein. Site 1 also includes the partially conserved N-linked glycosylation site at H-2Dd residue Asn176. At site 2, Ly49A binds in a broad cavity formed by the 2 and 3 domains of H-2Dd and 2-microglobulin ( 2m) (Fig. 2). This concave region partially overlaps the binding site for CD8 (Gao et al., 1997; Kern et al., 1998). The total buried surface of site 2 is much larger than of site 1 or approximately 3400 Å2 . In contrast to the site 1 interface, the site 2 interface displays relatively poor shape

complementarity, similar to that reported for the CD2/CD58 complex (Wang et al., 1999) and certain TCR-peptide/MHC complexes (Garcia et al., 1999). The interactions at site 2 are largely polar in nature and include numerous hydrogen bonds and bridging water molecules. The surfaces of Ly49A that contact H-2Dd at sites 1 and 2 both include loop 3 and mostly overlap, but the more extensive site 2 surface also comprises the loop between strands 3 and 4, and the loop between helix 2 and strand 2. This binding region is close to the conserved N-linked glycosylation site at position 86 of the H-2Dd 1 domain. The proximity of N-linked glycosylation sites Asn86 and Asnl76 of H-2Dd to the Ly49A binding sites suggests that oligosaccharides on the MHC-I molecule, though not strictly required for binding (Natarajan et al., 1999), could modulate the affinity of the interaction. 2.3. The site 1/2 conundrum The finding of two potential binding sites for Ly49A on H-2Dd was unexpected and immediately raised the question whether functional binding of the NK receptor to its MHC-I ligand is mediated by site 1 or 2, or both. As described earlier, using physicochemical parameters, such as the degree of shape complementarity or the amount of buried surface area, it was not possible to readily discount either site as an artifact of co-crystallization. Furthermore, either or both sites could be invoked to explain much of the available functional and binding data on the interaction of Ly49A and other members of the Ly49 family with MHC-I (Tormo et al., 1999). However, recent studies using site-directed mutants of both H-2Dd and Ly49A designed on the basis of

The KIR2DL2/HLA-Cw3 and NKG2D/MICA complexes (Boyington et al., 2000; Li et al., 2001) were superimposed onto the complex (Tormo et al., 1999) using equivalent C atoms of the l and 2 domains of HLA-Cw3, MICA and H-2Dd . Only the H-2Dd molecule is shown for clarity. The H-2Dd heavy chain is gold, the peptide is blue and 2m is gray. Ly49A interacting at site 2 is green, KIR2DL is magenta and NKG2D is red. The overlapping area of KIR2DL and NKG2D is transparent.

the crystal structure of the complex have resolved the site 1/2 conundrum by unambiguously identifying site 2 as the primary binding site for Ly49A on MHC-I. Matsumoto et al. (2001) constructed a panel of alaninesubstituted mutants of the H-2Dd heavy chain at both sites 1 and 2. Residues at site 2, but not site 1, were found to be critically important for Ly49A recognition, as determined by binding to soluble Ly49A and inhibition of cytotoxicity by Ly49A+ NK cells. In particular, alanine substitution of Arg6 or Aspl22 in the 1/ 2 domain of H-2Dd or of Lys243 in 3, completely abolished the physical, as well as functional, interaction between H-2Dd and Ly49A. In a comprehensive evaluation of mutants of both Ly49A and of H-2Dd , Wang et al. (2002) identified residues of Ly49A, H-2Dd and 2m that are critical to the Ly49A/H-2Dd interaction. These mutations pinpointed `hot spot' residues at the site 2 interface, implicating this large surface as the major determinant Ly49A/H-2Dd of functional interaction. Allelic and peptide preference, as well as contributions from 2m, could be explained by contacts involving H-2Dd residue Asp122 and 2m residues Gln29 and Lys58. Therefore, the general conclusion from both structural and mutational analyses is that the Ly49A homodimer makes its functional binding interaction with MHC-I at site 2, which is formed by the 1/ 2

and 3 domains of H-2Dd and 2m (Tormo et al., 1999; Matsumoto et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2002). 2.4. Comparison with NKG2D and KIRs In addition to the Ly49A/H-2Dd complex, crystal structures have now been reported for the C-type lectin-like NKG2D receptor in complex with the MHC-I homolog MICA (Li et al., 2001) and for the immunoglobulin-like KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL1 receptors bound to HLA-Cw3 (Boyington et al., 2000) and HLA-Cw4 (Fan et al., 2001), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, NKG2D and KIRs bind their respective ligands at sites distinct from Ly49A and from each other. The NKG2D homodimer binds orthogonally to the MICA 1/ 2 platform in a manner resembling the docking mode of TCRs onto MHC-I, such that each NKG2D monomer mainly contacts either the 1 or 2 domain of MICA through the -helical elements. KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2 also bind their HLA-C ligands orthogonally, through the 1 and 2 helices and the C-terminal portion of the bound peptide, but the NKG2D binding site on MICA only partially overlaps the KIR binding site on HLA-C (Fig. 3). These structures illustrate the multiplicity of solutions that NK receptors have evolved to accomplish the task
