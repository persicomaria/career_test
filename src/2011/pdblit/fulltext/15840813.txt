ABSTRACT Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts, thereby affecting coding potential of mature mRNAs. Structural determinants that define the adenosine moieties for specific ADARs-mediated deaminations are currently unknown. We report the solution structure of the central region of the human R/G stem­loop pre-mRNA, a natural ADAR2 substrate encoding the subunit B of the glutamate receptor (R/G site). The structure reveals that the GCU(A/C)A pentaloop that is conserved in mammals and birds adopts a novel fold. The fold is stabilized by a complex interplay of hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions. We propose that this new pentaloop structure is an important determinant of the R/G site recognition by ADAR2. Keywords: adenosine deaminase; NMR; RNA editing; RNA structure

INTRODUCTION Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosines to inosines embedded in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA; Polson et al. 1991; Bass et al. 1997; Emeson and Singh 2000; Gerber and Keller 2001; Bass 2002; Schaub and Keller 2002). The enzymatic activity requires the C-terminal adenosine deaminase domain to catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine, whereas RNA substrate recognition is mediated by the N-terminal double-stranded RNAbinding motifs (dsRBMs; Stefl et al. 2005). Depending on the RNA substrate structure, ADARs can deaminate as many as 50% of the adenosine residues within a perfect dsRNA (in a nonselective fashion) or as little as a single, specific adenosine moiety (Emeson and Singh 2000; Bass 2002). The majority of nonselective editing occurs in untranslated regions (UTRs) and introns where large regular duplexes are formed (Morse and Bass 1999; Rueter et al. 1999; Morse et al. 2002; Athanasiadis et al. 2004; Levanon et al. 2004). Such modifications can modulate gene silencing triggered by intramolecular structures in mRNA (Tonkin and Bass 2003), lead to the nuclear retention of RNA transcripts (Kumar and Carmichael 1997; Zhang and Carmichael 2001), or participate in an antiviral response (Wong et al. 1991) by extensive modification of viral RNAs. Con-

versely, selective editing has been shown to take place largely within codons, so that multiple RNA and protein isoforms can be created from a single genomic locus. For example, ADARs have been shown to produce functionally important isoforms for several proteins involved in synaptic neurotransmission, including ligand and voltage-gated ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (Sommer et al. 1991; Egebjerg and Heinemann 1993; Kohler et al. 1993; Lomeli et al. 1994; Burns et al. 1997; Hoopengardner et al. 2003). ADAR2 (a member of the mammalian ADAR family) specifically modifies the glutamate receptor subunit B (GluR-B) pre-mRNA at the R/G site (referred as R/G stem­ loop), where the genomic AGA encoding an arginine is modified after editing into IGA encoding a glycine (the ribosome interprets I as G). This amino acid change affects the biophysical properties of the ion channel, the R/G edited protein recovering faster from desensitization (Lomeli et al. 1994). The R/G site is located to a 71-nt intramolecular stem­loop in its pre-mRNA consisting of a stem with a few mismatches and a pentaloop (Fig. 1A). The secondary structure of the R/G stem­loop is strongly conserved in mammals and birds with the GCUMA pentaloop consensus (where M is A/C) (Aruscavage and Bass 2000). To date, there is still no structural insight into the process of A-to-I editing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We report the solution structure of the central region of the human R/G stem­loop, embedding the pentaloop GCUAA (referred as R/G central loop; Fig. 1B). Prior to structure

These data confirmed that the central fragment (nt 25­47; Fig. 1) maintains the same conformation adopted within the context of the full-length R/G stem­ loop. The structure of the R/G central loop was determined using 602 conformationally restrictive NOE-derived distance restraints, 128 torsion angle restraints, and 85 restraints derived from residual dipolar couplings. The R/G central loop adopts a stable stem­loop structure with a well-defined stem, adopting a standard A-form double-helical architecture, and with a structured GCUAA pentaloop, stabilized by a complex interplay of hydrogen bonding and

HSQC experiment with 100 msec mixing time. The NOEs were semi-quantitatively classified based on their intensities in the 2D and 3D NOESY spectra as follows: very strong (1.8­2.4 Å), strong (1.8­3.0 Å) medium (1.8­4.0 Å), weak (1.8­5.0 Å), and very weak (1.8­6.0 Å). NOEs involving exchangeable protons were observed in 2D NOESY in 90% H2O/10% D2O and all classified as very weak (1.8­6.0 Å). Hydrogen-bonding distance restraints were used only for the Watson­Crick base pairs, when the imino-proton was observed experimentally. The imino protons of U33 and G34 were not observed in the 2D NOESY, probably due to the exchange with solvent. For G34, it is expected since G34 H1 is not hydrogen bonded. However, the absence of U33 H3 is surprising since our structure shows that U33 is involved in a Watson­Crick base pair with A39. It is possible that the presence of the G34­A38 nonWatson­Crick base pair above U33 made the U33­A39 base pair less stable and therefore U33 H3 more prone to exchange with the solvent. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured from 1 JCH differences in t2-coupled HSQCs in the presence or absence of a C12E9/hexanol mixture (Ruckert and Otting 2000). All spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker) and analyzed using Sparky (T.D. Goddard and D.G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco).

Structure calculations more important role in the recognition processes mediated by dsRBM-containing proteins than was previously expected. MATERIALS AND METHODS RNA sample preparations
Unlabeled, uniformly 13C,15N-labeled RNA, and base-type-specifically 13C,15N-AC/GU-labeled RNA oligonucleotides were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase and DNA synthetic primers (Price et al. 1998) and purified either on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel or using HPLC under denaturing conditions. RNA oligonucleotides were annealed at low salt, pH 6.0, and dilute conditions by heating to 95°C and snap cooling on ice to ensure homogenous formation of the monomeric stem­loop conformation. The homogenous formation of the monomeric stem­loop conformation was confirmed by gel filtration coupled with in-line laser light scattering measurement (Wyatt Technology) and native PAGE analysis. Structures were calculated using AMBER 7.0 software (University of California, San Francisco) with the Cornell et al. (1995) force field, with the generalized-Born solvation model (Bashford and Case 2000), and with a refinement protocol as described (Padrta et al. 2002). Square-well penalty functions with force constants as indicated in Table 1 were used for all experimental restraints. Refinements were performed in two steps. In the first step, refinement with NOEs and torsion angles was done starting from com-

NMR spectroscopy
All the NMR experiments were conducted at 303 K on Bruker Avance-900 and DRX-750, 600, and 500 MHz spectrometers. Exchangeable proton resonances were assigned using two-dimensional (2D) NOESY spectrum (mixing time of 200 msec) of the RNA in 90% H2O/10% D2O at 278 K. Nonexchangeable proton resonances were assigned using 2D NOESY, 2D TOCSY, [1H-13C] HSQC, 3D [1H-13C-1H] HCCH TOCSY, and 3D [1H-13C-1H] NOESY-HSQC spectra in 99.99% D2O. NOE restraints of nonexchangeable protons were obtained from 2D NOESY experiments with mixing times of 30, 90, 150, and 250 msec, and 3D NOESY-

pletely randomized structures. In the second step, the RDCs were employed in addition to NOE and torsion angle restraints. Initial estimates of the alignment tensors were obtained from the preliminary structures resulting from the first refinement step, as described (Tsui et al. 2000). To impose better convergence of the ensembles some artificial torsion angle restraints were used for (270°­330°), (150°­210°), (30°­90°), (50°­110°), (180°­240°), and (260°­320°); these torsion angle restraints cover the A-form RNA double-helical range derived from highresolution crystal structures of RNA (NDB ID: AR0010 [R = 1.16 Å], AR0013 [R = 1.2 Å], AR0020 [R = 1.20 Å], AR0021 [R = 1.20 Å], ARB002 [R = 0.8 Å], ARB003 [R = 1.1 Å], ARB004 [R = 0.9 Å], ARB005 [R = 0.8 Å], ARF0108 [R = 1.8 Å], and ARH064 [R = 1.8 Å]). These torsion angle restraints do not exert any force on the final structures. To prevent high violations of local geometries while accommodating the RDC restraints, additional angle restraints to maintain proper local geometries were employed (Tsui et al. 2000). The family of best structures (13 out of 30 calculated) was selected on the basis of lowest energy criteria. Molecular graphics was generated using MOLMOL (Koradi et al. 1996). The hydrogen bonds found in the pentaloop were not observed experimentally but were deduced based on distances and angles between the proton, the donor, and the acceptor in the ensemble of structures. Atomic coordinates and NMR restraints have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank under accession code (1YSV). The chemical shifts have been deposited into the BioMagResBank Database (accession code BMRB-6485).
