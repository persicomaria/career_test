The activities of three Rab-speci®c factors with GDP/GTP exchange activity, Vps9p, Rabex-5 and DSS4, with their cognate GTPases, Ypt51p, Rab5 and Ypt1p, have been analysed quantitatively. In contrast to other exchange factors examined and to DSS4, Vps9p, and by analogy probably Rabex-5, have considerably lower af®nity than GDP to the respective GTPases. In keeping with this, they are relatively weak exchangers, with a maximal rate constant for GDP release from the ternary complex between exchange factor, GTPase and GDP of ca 0.01 sÀ1, which is several orders of magnitude lower than for other exchange factors examined. If interaction with these proteins is a mandatory aspect of the Rab cycle, this suggests that the overall rate of cycling might be controlled at this point of the cycle. Surprisingly, DSS4, which has the thermodynamic potential to displace GDP effectively from Ypt1p, also does this very slowly, again with a maximal rate constant of ca 0.01 sÀ1. An additional, and based on present knowledge, unique, feature of the Ypt1p.DSS4 complex, is that the association of GTP (or GDP) is more than 103-fold slower than to Ypt1p, thus leading to a long life-time of the binary complex between the two proteins, even at the high nucleotide concentrations that prevail in the cell. This leads to the conclusion that the protein-protein complex is likely to have an important biological signi®cance in addition to its probable role in GTP/GDP exchange.

of motility of vesicles along cytoskeletal ®laments.6,7 They perform these functions by interacting with several distinct effector proteins. In common with other members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases), they cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. The transition between these two states is governed by GTP hydrolysis and GDP dissociation (with subsequent GTP association), processes that are regulated by distinct activities of additional protein factors. These are the GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) and GEFs (GDP/GTP-exchange factors), which, as for other members of the Ras superfamily, accelerate these intrinsically slow processes by several orders of magnitude. While quantitative data are available for the interaction of Rab proteins with their respective GAP molecules (at least in the case of the yeast Rab proteins termed Ypt8,9), only a lim# 2001 Academic Press

Known Rab-speci®c proteins showing exchange activity can be separated roughly into two categories based on their substrate speci®city. On the one hand, proteins such as Sec2, Vps9, Rabex-5 and Rab3a GEF are active on a single cognate Rab GTPase.10 ± 13 On the other hand, proteins originally identi®ed as exchange factors, Mss4 and DSS4, are active on a subset of Rab/Ypt proteins.14 ± 17 It has in fact been questioned whether the latter proteins function as genuine exchange factors.18,19 Here, we report the detailed kinetic characterisation of the interaction of Ypt51p with Vps9p,20 of Rab5 with Rabex-512 and of Ypt1p with DSS4.16

Results
The results obtained are discussed in terms of the coupled equilibria shown in Scheme 1 (G is the GTPase, GXP is GDP or GTP and GEF the guanine nucleotide exchange factor).

and 101 in Ypt51p), and the ¯uorescence signal from these residues is sensitive to the nucleotide at the active site. For both proteins, the ¯uorescence intensity was highest for the GDP-bound state and decreased signi®cantly (ca 50 % for Ypt51p and somewhat less for Ypt1p) in the GTP-bound state. The nucleotide-free proteins showed intermediate ¯uorescence intensities. It is of interest to note that the same qualitative behaviour was observed for Rab5 and Rab7,21 both of which also have tryptophan residues at equivalent positions. While it is not possible on the basis of present evidence to decide which of the trytophan residues contributes to the signal change seen, it is noteworthy that the residue at position 61 (or 62) immediately precedes the aspartate residue of the highly conserved WDTAGQE sequence. This aspartate residue is an indirect (via a water molecule) ligand of the magnesium ion associated with the nucleotide in the 3-D structure of Ypt51p.24 The residues between alanine residue 64 (or 65) and the start of the next alpha helix (alanine residue 70 or arginine 71) constitute the catalytically important loop 4 region, or switch II, which is presumed to undergo major structural changes on GTP hydrolysis. Thus, we speculate that it is likely that the changes in the tryptophan signal re¯ect this transition. These changes in tryptophan ¯uorescence could be used to monitor the time-course of the interactions in a time-dependent manner. The individual time-courses could be ®tted as single exponentials as long as nucleotide was present in large excess over nucleotide-free protein. In all cases (i.e. Ypt1p or Ypt51p with GTP or with GDP), plots of the observed pseudo ®rst-order rate constant against the nucleotide concentration were hyperbolic, as shown in Figure 1 for Ypt51p and GTP. This is similar to the behaviour seen with other GTPases22,25 and is indicative of a two-step binding mechanism in which a rapid but weak equilibrium is followed by a relatively slow isomerisation, interpreted as a conformational change of the protein-nucleotide complex, as shown in Scheme 2:

Equation (1) will be referred to throughout the work. Expressed verbally, it means that if the interaction of GEF with G weakens its af®nity for GDP (or GTP), then the converse applies in the same measure (i.e. the interaction of GDP with G weakens its af®nity for GEF). The basic mechanism of GEFs is based on this effect, although the principle can be modi®ed further by differential effects on individual kinetic constants, as discussed below. Interaction of Ypt1p and Ypt51p with guanosine nucleotides Methods developed previously for examining the kinetics of GDP and GTP interaction with GTPases21 ± 23 were applied to the two Ypt proteins used here. The proteins contain conserved tryptophan residues (positions 62 and 102 in Ypt1p, 61

Scheme 2.

Fitting a hyperbolic curve to the data of Figure 1 leads to values for K1a and k1b.22 Within the limits of error, the ®tted curve passes through the origin of the graph. This shows that the value of kÀ1b (which controls the overall rate of dissociation) is too small to be estimated by this method. The dissociation rate of the ¯uorescent GDP analog, mantGDP, could be measured directly by displacing it from its complex with Ypt1p or Ypt51p with a large excess of unlabelled GDP (data not

143 the labelled nucleotide with the protein. It was assumed that the ¯uorescent label on the nucleotide does not have a major in¯uence on the nucleotide dissociation rate constant, as already shown for other GTPases.22,25 The values obtained for the constants of Scheme 2 are given in Tables 1 and 2. The product of K1a and k1b is referred to as kon, since it represents the effective second-order rate constant of association at low nucleotide concentration or, in other words, the initial slope of the hyperbola as shown in Figure 1. For the methylanthraniloyl derivatives, high concentrations of nucleotide could not be used in the association reaction, due to the high background ¯uorescence, so that only the initial slope of the hyperbola (corresponding to K1a Â k1b) could be determined. The value of kÀ1b for mantGppNHp is used as an estimate for the constant for GTP. Since it is known from previous work on other GTPases that the modi®cation to the triphosphate moiety tends to increase the dissociation rate, this should be regarded as an upper limit for GTP. The data presented in the Tables con®rm the similarities between the two Ypt proteins and other small GTPases with respect to their nucleotide-binding properties. In comparison with Rab5,21 the overall af®nity is a factor of ca 10 lower for Ypt1p and Ypt51p. This effect arises mainly from an increased dissociation rate (kÀ1b) for Ypt1p, whereas for Ypt51p it arises from a combination of reduced association and increased dissociation rate constants. Rab7 displays even tighter binding (a factor of ca 100 higher than Ypt1p or Ypt51p), mainly due to a much faster effective association rate constant (3 Â 106-5 Â 106 MÀ1 sÀ1).21 Kinetic characterisation of the Vps9p-Ypt51psystem: interaction of nucleotide-free Ypt51p and Vps9p The association of Ypt51p and Vps9p resulted in a small increase in tryptophan ¯uorescence. Although this could not be used conveniently for equilibrium titration experiments, since both proteins contain tryptophan, the signal was perfectly adequate for stopped-¯ow experiments. This allowed the determination of the pseudo ®rst-order rate constant for the association reaction as a function of the Vps9p concentration at constant Ypt51p concentration, as shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that there is a linear dependence of this rate con-

shown). As described previously for Rab5 and Rab7,21 advantage could be taken of the fact that energy transfer occurs between the protein tryptophan residues and the methylanthraniloyl group, resulting in a large signal change on interaction of

stant on the Vps9p concentration and that, within the limits of experimental error, the linear ®t passes through the origin, suggesting a very low rate for the dissociation reaction. The association rate constant, which is given by the slope of the straight line in the Figure, has a value of 3.1 Â 105 MÀ1 sÀ1. We refer to this constant as k2, since the inter-

action corresponds to that described by K2 in Scheme 1. In order to measure kÀ2, one of the two protein components of the system must be available in a form that is spectroscopically distinguishable from the essentially wild-type proteins used so far. In an initial attempt to achieve this, a mutant of Ypt51p that contained no tryptophan residues, Ypt51p(W61FW101F), was prepared. However, this mutant was not stable enough in the nucleotide-free form to allow it to be used to displace the wild-type protein from its complex with Vps9p. We therefore adopted the strategy of labelling Vps9p with a ¯uorescent group for this purpose. Labelling with dansyl chloride led to introduction of two dansyl groups, as shown by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (spectra not shown). Association of dansyl-labelled Vps9p with nucleotide-free Ypt51p leads to an increase in ¯uorescence of the label. As shown in Figure 3, this signal could be used to monitor the kinetics of the association reaction. The dependence of the pseudo ®rst-order rate constant on the Ypt51p concentration was linear and corresponded to an association rate constant of k2  2.9 Â 105MÀ1sÀ1, in good agreement with the value obtained with unlabelled proteins (k2  3.1 Â 105MÀ1sÀ1). The dissociation rate constant of labelled Vps9p from its complex with Ypt51p was determined by displacement with unlabelled Vps9p (data not shown). The single exponential ®t to the curve obtained gave a rate constant of kÀ2  4.7 Â 10À3 sÀ1. Taking the ratio of the reverse and forward constants to give the Kd for the interaction leads to a value of 15.2 nM. This corresponds to 1/K2 in Scheme 1. Interaction of the Vps9p.Ypt51p complex with guanosine nucleotides On interaction of the complex between the two proteins with GTP or GDP, there was a decrease in tryptophan intensity. The pseudo ®rst-order rate constant determined from such curves as those shown in Figure 4(a) increased hyperbolically with increasing GTP concentration (Figure 4(b)). This behaviour is interpreted in terms of a two-step mechanism, in which a weak initial binding is followed by a second step, which is either the dissociation of the protein-protein complex or a rate-limiting isomerisation that precedes this. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we repeated this experiment with a large excess of

145 escence change comes from nucleotide interaction with Vps9p.Ypt51p complex and not with nucleotide-free Ypt51p (data not shown). The values of the constants for these two processes are K4a  2.3 Â 103MÀ1 and k4b  24.3 sÀ1 for GTP, and K4a  1.5 Â 104 MÀ1 and k4b  20.8 sÀ1 for GDP, respectively (constants named according to the two-step binding mechanism of Scheme 2). Similar experiments could be performed using dansyl-labelled Vps9p. The rate of the decrease in dansyl ¯uorescence observed on interaction of GTP or GDP with the complex between Ypt51p and labelled Vps9p showed a concentration-dependence similar to that seen using intrinsic tryptophan ¯uorescence (data not shown; results summarized in Table 3). Finally, this process could be observed using ¯uorescently labelled nucleotides with unlabelled proteins. Only a limited concentration range of these nucleotides could be used, due to the high background ¯uorescence caused by excess nucleotide, but their behaviour was quantitatively similar to that of unlabelled nucleotides. These data suggest that the method chosen for labelling nucleotides and Vps9p did not have a major effect on their interactions with Ypt51p. The results are summarized in Table 3. Interaction of Vps9p with Ypt51p-nucleotide complexes Addition of Vps9p to a complex between Ypt51p and mantGDP led to relatively slow release of a small fraction of the bound nucleotide. As can be seen in Figure 5(a), at 150 nM Ypt51p.mantGDP, 3 mM Vps9p led to ca 10 % release of bound nucleotide. This is understandable in qualitative terms, since there is a strong competitive component in binding of nucleotide and exchanger in such systems, and the data presented above show that mantGDP is bound ca 60-fold more strongly than Vps9p, so that high concentrations of Vps9p are needed to compete with nucleotide binding in this equilibrium situation. Complete displacement of the ¯uorescent nucleotide was observed on addition of excess unlabelled GDP. As shown in Figure 5(b), there was a hyperbolic dependence of the rate constant for mantGDP release on the Vps9p concentration, which saturated at an extrapolated value of 1.2 Â 10À2 sÀ1 with an apparent Kd value of 2.3 Â 10À5 M.

correspond to the constants 1/K3 and kÀ4 respectively, in Scheme 1. It is of interest to note that the ®rst phase in Figure 5(a), which arises from displacement of mantGDP under the in¯uence of Vps9p alone (i.e. without an unlabelled displacing nucleotide), did not increase signi®cantly in amplitude at high Vps9p concentrations. Although the quality of the data obtained was not adequate for a quantitative analysis (due to the relatively small signal amplitude and low stability at long measurement times), this is already an indication that the af®nity of mantGDP in the ternary complex with Ypt51p and Vps9p is still relatively high, since complete dissociation cannot be induced by Vps9p even at the low prevailing total protein bound nucleotide concentration of 150 nM. Since the data suggest that

less than 50 % of the mantGDP can be displaced, a simple calculation shows that its Kd value (corresponding to 1/K4) must be less than 75 nM. This corresponds well with the value of 37 nM, which can be calculated from analysis of the complete scheme as described below. The in¯uence of Vps9p on the dissociation of mantGppNHp from its complex could not be examined quantitatively. On increasing the Vps9p concentration in the range of 0.5 to 10 mM, an approximately tenfold increase in the nucleotide dissociation rate (from 3 Â 10À5 sÀ1 (kÀ1b) in the absence of the exchange factor to 3.8 Â 10À4 sÀ1

147 other GTPases, it seems reasonable to expect an analogous process to occur when GDP or GTP bind to the Vps9p.Ypt51p complex. We have thus considered two alternative models (A and B) for the association of GDP with the binary protein complex and assigned rate and equilibrium constants arising from the experiments described using the nomenclature of Scheme 1. Model B

(kÀ4b) in its presence) was observed, but accurate estimation of the extremely slow process was dif®cult due to problems of stability and photobleaching. These results can be interpreted in two principally different manners. In one model, GTP and Vps9p binding to Ypt51p are highly competitive, so that the ternary complex is very unstable, and

Scheme 3.

signi®cant generation of this complex, which would be a prerequisite for acceleration of GTP dissociation, could occur only at very high Vps9p concentrations. In the second possibility, which would seem unlikely for a protein whose properties are those of an exchange factor, Vps9p and Ypt51p.GTP would form a relatively stable complex from which both GTP and Vps9p can dissociate only slowly. To distinguish between these possibilities, the Ypt51p.GppNHp complex was tested as an inhibitor of the in¯uence of Vps9p on the dissociation of mantGDP from its complex with Ypt51p. In a series of experiments (data not shown), the in¯uence of Ypt51p.GppNHp on the exchange kinetics of 150 nM Ypt51p.mantGDP in the presence of 5 mM Vps9p and 50 mM GDP were examined. No in¯uence was detected, even when Ypt51p.GppNHp was present in twofold excess (10 mM) over Vps9p. This suggests that the af®nity of Vps9p for the GTP-form of Ypt51p is weak (1/ K3 value of greater than 10 mM). Analysis of the data from the three-component system consisting of Vps9p, Ypt51p and GDP A fundamental question to be answered in analysing the data obtained is concerned with whether the ternary complex between the proteins and the nucleotide can exist in more than one form. Since it is clear from the data on interaction of nucleotides with Ypt51p that there is a two-step binding mechanism involving a protein isomerisation, as with

includes an additional isomerisation step of the ternary complex. In model A, K4 is 1.5 Â 104 MÀ1 and kÀ3 is 20.8 sÀ1. K4 in model A corresponds to K4a in model B and kÀ3 in model A corresponds to k4b in model B. kÀ4 in model A corresponds to kÀ4b in model B and has the value of 1.2 Â 10À2sÀ1. For model B, we can de®ne K4 in the sense of Scheme 1 as being equal to K4a Â k4b/kÀb and it has the value of 2.7 Â 107MÀ1. Thus, in terms of Scheme 1, the only quantitative difference between the two models is in the value of K4, which is 1.5 Â 104 MÀ1 for model A and 2.7 Â 107 MÀ1 for model B. Since the relationship K1 Â K3  K2 Â K4 must hold for both models, this can be used to test their consistency. In model A, K1 Â K3 has the value 9.5 Â 1013 MÀ2, while K2 Â K4 has the value 9.9 Â 1011 MÀ2. Thus, there is a discrepancy of a factor of 100. In model B, K1 Â K3 is again 9.5 Â 1013 MÀ2, and K2 Â K4 is 1.8 Â 1015 MÀ2. Thus in this case, the discrepancy is considerably smaller (a factor of ca 20). Although this is still quite large, it must be remembered that the individual rate constants in the Scheme were determined using different signals, i.e. some measurements were with unlabelled proteins and unlabelled nucleotides, whereas others used labelled proteins or labelled nucleotides, so that accumulation of small errors could lead to the relatively large discrepancy. The better quantitative agreement of model B than model A leads to the conclusion that it is reasonable to use model B as the minimum

and the best strategy identi®ed led only to small amounts of soluble protein. An extensive series of experiments on the interaction with Rab5 were precluded by the small quantities available and by the very low stability of Rabex-5. Due to these

Scheme 4.

An attractive feature of this Scheme is that the isomerisation occurring on interaction of GDP with nucleotide-freeYpt is re¯ected by a similar process when GDP binds to the Vps9p.Ypt51p complex. The equilibrium constants for the ®rst step (K1a and K4a, respectively) have similar values, as does the forward rate constant for the isomerisation step (k1b and k4b). The isomerisation step of the ternary complex can be regarded as involving a transition between two forms of Ypt51p, one of which binds nucleotide weakly (Ypt51p.GDP) but Vps9p strongly, while the other (Ypt51p*.GDP) binds nucleotide strongly but Vps9p weakly. The constants for the interaction of Ypt51p, Vps9p and nucleotides are summarized in Table 4. Exchange activity of Rabex-5 The mammalian protein that is analogous to Vps9p is Rabex-5, and its cognate GTPase is Rab5. In order to compare its properties with those of Vps9p, we carried out extensive experiments aimed at expressing adequate amounts of the protein. However, this was only partially successful,

limitations, only one type of experiment was performed, which was the catalysis of nucleotide dissociation from Rab5. As shown in Figure 6(a), individual experiments were qualitatively similar to those with Vps9p, i.e. addition of Rabex-5 to Rab5.mantGDP led to a small extent of nucleotide release but, on addition of excess unlabelled GDP, complete dissociation of mantGDP could be achieved at a rate that was dependent on the Rabex-5 concentration (Figure 6(b)). The concentration dependence of the rate constant showed saturation behaviour with a maximum of 7.4 Â 10À3 sÀ1, of the same order of magnitude as that observed for Vps9p and Ypt51p (1.2 Â 10À2 sÀ1). However, the concentration dependence was quantitatively different, with an apparent Kd between Rabex-5 and Rab5.mantGDP of 270 nM, compared with 23 mM for Vps9p and Ypt51p.mantGDP (see Figure 5). Assuming that the same basic mechanism pertains for this system as for Vps9p.Ypt51p, the value of 7.4 Â 10À3sÀ1 corresponds to kÀ4b and 270 nM to 1/K3 in Scheme 4. As in the Vps9p.Ypt51p system, displacement of the GTP analog mantGppNHp from its complex

149 Thus, at low concentrations of Rabex-5, GDP appears to be displaced almost two orders of magnitude more effectively than GTP (taking GppNHp as a model substance) by Rabex-5. Kinetic characterization of the DSS4-Ypt1psystem: interaction of nucleotide-free Ypt1p and DSS4 The interaction of nucleotide-free Ypt1p and DSS4 could be monitored by tryptophan ¯uorescence, since there was a reduction of intrinsic ¯uorescence on interaction of the two proteins. The dependence of the pseudo ®rst-order rate constant for the association reaction on the concentration of DSS4 shows a linear dependence (data not shown), from which the association rate constant (k2) can be calculated to be 1.02 Â 106 MÀ1 sÀ1. In order to measure the dissociation rate constant of the DSS4.Ypt1p complex, a further signal was needed. By analogy to Vps9p, an attempt was made to label DSS4 with dansyl chloride. Although this led to ¯uorescently labelled protein, this was so unstable that it could not be used for kinetic experiments. In contrast, Ypt1p could be labelled with dansyl chloride to give a stable ¯uorescent protein. To check that the properties of the labelled protein were not signi®cantly different from those of unlabelled protein, the association with DSS4 was examined. This led to an increase in ¯uorescence if the FRET signal was used and measuring the dependence of the rate constant for this change on the DSS4 concentration led to a rate constant (k2) of 1.4 Â 106 MÀ1 sÀ1 for the association rate constant, in good agreement with the value of 1.02 Â 106 MÀ1 sÀ1 from the intrinsic ¯uorescence signal. Thus, labelling the protein does not appear to have a major effect on the interaction of the two proteins. The rate constant for dissociation (kÀ2) of dansyllabelled, nucleotide-free Ypt1p from its complex with DSS4 was measured by displacement with unlabelled nucleotide-free Ypt1p and was found to be 7.2 Â 10À4 sÀ1. The Kd (1/K2 in Scheme 1) value for the interaction was calculated to be 0.7 nM (K2  1.42 Â 109 MÀ1). Thus, the af®nity of nucleotide-free Ypt1p to DSS4 is ca 20 fold higher than that between nucleotide-free Ypt1p and GDP or GTP (K1  2.5 Â 109 MÀ1 for both nucleotides). Interaction of the DSS4.Ypt1p complex with guanosine nucleotides Two useful signals were identi®ed for monitoring the interaction of nucleotides with the DSS4.Ypt1p complex. One of these was the FRET signal resulting from binding of mantGDP or mantGppNHp. This reaction was surprisingly slow, as shown in Figure 7. The slope of the plot of kobs against the nucleotide concentration was 1.5 Â 102 MÀ1sÀ1 for mantGDP and 0.8 Â 102 MÀ1sÀ1 for mantGppNHp, or a factor of ca 103 lower than for nucleotide association with

Data were collected using an SLM 8100 spectrophotometer with the FRET signal as a signal of the exchange reaction: 150 nM Rab5 and 600 nM Rabex-5 were mixed and in the second part of the curve, GDP was added to a ®nal concentration of 50 mM.

At 37  C, data were obtained (not shown) that showed a linear dependence of the observed ®rst order rate constant on the Rabex-5 concentration. The slope of the ®tted line was ca 103 MÀ1sÀ1, corresponding to K3 Â kÀ4b in Scheme 4 and can be compared with the value of 7.25 Â 104 MÀ1sÀ1 that can be calculated for mantGDP under these conditions (at 37  C, kÀ4b was 1.8 Â 10À2sÀ1 and 1/K3 was 248 nM for mantGDP).

the Vps9p.Ypt51p complex (mantGDP kon  2.1 Â 105 MÀ1sÀ1; mantGppNHp kon  3.2 Â 104 MÀ1sÀ1). Using the other signal identi®ed for this interaction, i.e. the FRET signal observed using dansyl-labelled Ypt1, similar results were obtained, with the initial slope of the plot of the observed rate constant against the nucleotide concentration suggesting a second-order rate constant of ca 102 MÀ1 sÀ1 for GDP and GTP. In this case, considerably higher concentrations of nucleotides could be used, and it was clear that there was a hyperbolic dependence of the rate constant on the nucleotide concentration (Figure 8). The Kd values (corresponding to 1/K4 in scheme 1) were 15.1 mM and 31.1 mM, respectively, for GDP and GTP, while the maximal rate constants (interpreted as kÀ3) were 1.3 Â 10À2 sÀ1 for GDP and 1.6 Â 10À2 sÀ1 for GTP. As shown in Table 5, the calculated kon rates for

nucleotides at low concentrations (K4 Â kÀ3) were somewhat higher for the natural nucleotides than for ¯uorescently labelled nucleotides. Although this rate is very slow, it is still more then tenfold faster than the spontaneous rate of dissociation of the DSS4.Ypt1 complex, excluding the possibility that GDP or GTP cannot associate until the binary complex has dissociated. Interaction of DSS4 with Ypt1-nucleotide complexes In contrast to the situation with Vps9p and Rabex-5, DSS4 was found to be thermodynamically highly effective in displacing nucleotides from their complexes with Ypt1 (Figure 9(a)). Under the conditions used (150 nM Ypt1.mantGDP), com-

plete displacement of mantGDP was observed using micromolar concentrations of DSS4. This was monitored in each experiment by the addition of unlabelled GDP, which would lead to the release of any remaining bound mantGDP or mantGppNHp. Despite the effective displacement of proteinbound nucleotide, the rate of release was still very slow in comparison with the exchange factors for other members of the Ras-superfamily. Thus, the maximum rate constant for release of mantGDP from its DSS4.Ypt1.mantGDP complex (kobs extrapolated from the data of Figure 9(b)) was 1.1 Â 10À2 sÀ1, compared to ca 20 sÀ1 for Ran and The corresponding constant for RCC1.26 mantGppNHp, which could also be displaced effectively by DSS4, was 3.2 Â 10À2 sÀ1. The concentration-dependence of the observed rate constant for release of the mant nucleotides leads to an estimate of the Kd ( 1/K3) value between

by K1 is a two-step process, it seems likely that that described by K4, i.e. the binding of nucleotide to the binary DSS4.Ypt1 complex, is also likely to involve two-steps. If we assume this to be the case, we can use a scheme identical with that used for Ypt51p and Vps9p, and the reason for the good quantitative agreement when comparing K1 Â K3 and K2 Â K4 becomes apparent. This is because in the additional step (described by k4b and kÀ4b) the forward and reverse rate constants are essentially equal, giving an equilibrium constant of 1. Thus, the essential difference between the schemes for Ypt51p and Vps9p on the one hand and Ypt1 and DSS4 on the other is in this step, which has an equilibrium constant of ca 2000 in the former and of ca 1 in the latter case. This difference is completely due to the difference in k4b, and is compensated for by the much larger value of K2 for this system than those for the Ypt51 and Vps9p systems (see Tables 4 and 6):

DSS4 and the corresponding nucleotide-bound Ypt1. These are calculated to be 16.7 for mantGDP and 32.2 mM for mantGppNHp, respectively. To test the validity of the assignment of rate and equilibrium constants, the same procedure as that used for Ypt51p and Vps9p was used. In this case, for GDP, K1 Â K3 has the value 1.5 Â 1014 MÀ2, while K2 Â K4 has the value 1.1 Â 1014 MÀ2. For GTP, K1 Â K3 is 5.4 Â 1013 MÀ2, and K2 Â K4 is 9.9 Â 1013 MÀ2. Thus there is good agreement, suggesting that the assignment of rate and equilibrium constants is correct. However, this does not mean that additional steps in the mechanism do not occur, but simply that the composite constants derived are a good quantitative re¯ection of the individual constants. Since the process described

The constants for the interaction of GTP, Ypt1p and DSS4 show no major differences from those for GDP. They are summarized in Table 6.

Conclusions
The results described here represent a quantitative description of the activity of the three proteins Vps9p, Rabex-5 and DSS4 with their cognate Rab proteins, Ypt51p, Rab5 and Ypt1p. A feature they have in common is that in comparison to the wellcharacterized RCC1 (exchange factor for Ran27 ± 31) and EF-Ts, exchange factor for EF-Tu,32 they show relatively weak exchange activity, with a maximal rate constant for the release of GDP from its tern-

ary complex of ca 10À2 sÀ1 in all three cases. While this is very slow in comparison with Ran-RCC1 (ca 20 sÀ1) and EF-Tu (ca 100 sÀ1), it still represents an acceleration of a factor of 102 to 103 over the spontaneous dissociation rate of GDP from the GTPase in the absence of the exchange factor. A peculiarity of the homologous Vps9p.Ypt51p and Rabex5.Rab5 systems is that exchange activity at realistic physiological protein concentrations is much weaker for GTP than for GDP, a feature not seen for other systems investigated or for DSS4.Ypt1p, as described here. It should be noted that all experiments reported here have been performed with Rab proteins that are not post-translationally modi®ed (i.e. C-terminally prenylated). It is possible that there will be some in¯uence of this modi®cation, or in particular of the membrane-bound localisation of the Rab proteins, on the interaction with the proteins showing exchange activity used here. Indeed, in the case of a protein (Rab3 GEPII) identi®ed as an exchange factor for Rab3, it was shown that exchange was dependent on prenylation, or at least that the exchange reaction was enhanced on prenylation.33 However, the exchange activity of MSS4, the mammalian counterpart of DSS4, on Rab3 was reported in the same contribution to be prenylation-independent. It is presently not technically convenient to produce large quantities of geranylgeranylated Rabs to perform the kind of experiments reported here, but it seems unlikely that the fundamental principles of the interactions will be changed. What seems more likely is that the main effect of membrane localization of Rabs on their interaction with molecules showing exchange activity will be on the af®nity between the two proteins, but not on the details of the actual exchange mechanism, so that the rates of exchange determined at saturating concentrations are likely to be valid. Reasons for the weak exchange activity must be sought at the mechanistic as well as the cellbiological level. Vps9p, and most probably Rabex-5 by homology, together with cdc25 as an exchanger for Ras,34 have a signi®cantly lower af®nity than GDP or GTP for their cognate GTPases, so that they are thermodynamically less able to compete with the nucleotide ligands. The ``fast'' exchangers,

153 GDP release (or more importantly regeneration of the active GTP complex). In the case of DSS4, it is possible that the long lifetime of its complex with its cognate GTPase allows a further interaction speci®c for this state to occur.

such as RCC1 and EF-Ts, have af®nities that are at least as high as those of the nucleotides for the respective GTPases, thus giving them more thermodynamic ``power''. However, DSS4 has an af®nity for Ypt1p that is similar to that of GDP, so that the thermodynamic potential for ef®cient GDP displacement is, in principle, present in the system. The fact that the maximal dissociation rate of GDP from the ternary complex is as slow as in the other two systems suggests that this relative kinetic stability, which leads to a long lifetime of the ternary complexes, is a necessary requirement for its mode of action for all three systems, but particularly in the case of DSS4, where the lifetime of the proteinprotein interaction is extended even further by a phenomenon that has not been observed for any of the other exchangers examined in this or in other work. While, in general, the rate constant for the association of nucleotides with the binary complex between GTPase and exchange factor is at least as fast as for the GTPase alone, in the case of the DSS4.Ypt1p complex it is reduced by more than three orders of magnitude in comparison with association with the GTPase alone. Thus, in the normal cycle of activity, after the slow step of GDP dissociation in this system, the binary complex has a relatively long half-life (at saturating GTP concentration several tens of seconds) before dissociation into free DSS4 and Ypt1p.GTP. This is in strong contrast to the situation with Ypt51p and Vps9p or Rab5 and Rabex-5, which after losing GDP are dissociated rapidly by GTP into the GTPase.GTP complex and exchange factor. The question then arises as to whether the long lifetime of the protein-protein complex in the case of Ypt1p and DSS4, which is a thermodynamic consequence of the higher af®nity between the two proteins, is of signi®cance for the biological activity of Ypt1p. Since Ypt1p is located in the membrane of the compartments, that it is involved in regulating, this would mean that DSS4 is held in this location for a relatively long period and, since it is clear from other exchange systems that the step of GTPinduced dissociation can in fact be very rapid, it seems likely that this relatively long period of location at the membrane is of functional signi®cance. Our results thus qualify and extend the suggestion made18,19 that MSS4 and DSS4 are not simply nucleotide-exchange factors but act as ``chaperones'' for the nucleotide-free state of the cognate Rab protein. However, the basis for this is not simply the high af®nity of MSS4 or DSS4 for the nucleotide-free GTPase, since this is a fundamental property of all exchange systems examined so far for the Ras superfamily. Our results show that it is the speci®c property of slow association of GTP with the binary complex of the exchange factor and the GTPase, in contrast to the much faster rate seen in all other systems examined. The cell-biological signi®cance of the properties reported here could be that the overall cycling time of Rab activity (and therefore of vesicular fusion activity) is strictly controlled by the limited rate of

Materials and Methods
Cloning of Ypt51p, Vps9p, Ypt51p (W61FW101F), DSS4, Ypt1p and Rabex-5 The cDNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used in a PCR ampli®cation reaction to produce the coding sequence of Ypt51p,Vps9p and DSS4. The following primers, containing a NdeI and XhoI restriction site, were used for the cloning of Ypt51p and Vps9p: Vps9p NdeI remover, 5H -GGTTAAATCTTTCATGTGCTCATCGTCTAATGG-3H ; Vps9 NdeI forward, 5H -GAATCAACACATATGACTGATGATGAAAAGAGGG-3H ; Vps9 XhoI reverse, 5H -TATGTGCTCGAGATCATTATTCTGACAGA GAAAG-3H ; Ypt51p NdeI forward, 5H -TCACACAAACATATGAACACATCAGTCACTTCC-3H ; Ypt51p XhoI reverse, 5H -TTTATTCTCGAGTCACTAACAACTGCAAGCACTG-3H . The forward and reverse primers to amplify the coding sequence of DSS4 had the following sequences and contain a BspHI or SalI restriction site, respectively: DSS4 BspHI forward, 5H -GAATAACAGAGATCATGAGCAAGGCTACGTGTTCCTTTG-3H ; DSS4 SalI reverse, 5H -GTGCCTGTCGACCTAATTCCTTCCCATAATTTG-3H . The coding sequence of Vps9p contains an NdeI restriction site, which had to be removed for the cloning procedure. Therefore, in a ®rst PCR reaction the Vps9p NdeI forward and Vps9p XhoI reverse primers were used. The resulting 1353 bp fragment was used as a template in a second PCR reaction using the NdeI forward and Vps9p NdeI remover primers in order to mutate the NdeI sequence CATATG to CACATG without a change in the amino acid sequence. The resulting ca 600 bp fragment was used as a mega primer with the Vps9p XhoI reverse primer in a third PCR reaction using the ampli®cation product of the ®rst PCR reaction as a template. The sequence of Ypt51p and DSS4 was produced in a PCR reaction using the above-mentioned primers. The PCR fragment of DSS4 was restricted with BspHI and SalI and could be ligated with the pET19b-TEV vector restricted with NcoI and SalI. The PCR products of Ypt51p and Vps9p restricted with NdeI and XhoI were cloned into the pET19b-TEV vector pre-cut with the same enzymes. For construction of the pET19b-TEV expression plasmid, see Alexandrov et al.35 The integrity of the reading frame and the coding sequence was determined by nucleotide sequencing. Mutations of the tryptophan residues at positions 61 and 101 of Ypt51p were introduced PCR using the following primers: W61F BglII forward, 5H -AGTTTGAGATCTTCGACACTGCTGGGCAAGAG-3H ; W61F BglII reverse, 5H -TGTCCCAGATCTCAAACTTAACAGTATGTTC-3H ; W101F SacI forward, 5H -GTAAAGGAGCTCCATGAACAGGCATCAAAGG-3H ; W101F SacI reverse, 5H -TTCATGGAGCTCCTTTACGAAGTGGCGCGCTTTAATAAAGG-3H . The TGG sequence coding for tryptophan residues was mutated to TTC coding for phenylalanine residues. The primers used contain a BglII restriction site at position 61 and a SacI restriction site at position 101. In two PCR reactions using the BglII forward and SacI reverse primer or the SacI forward and the BglII reverse primer,

154
two fragments of ca 6200 bp and ca 120 bp were ampli®ed. After restriction with the corresponding enzymes these fragments were ligated. The presence of mutations and the integrity of coding sequence were veri®ed by DNA sequencing. To generate the pET19b-TEV-Ypt1p vector, the coding sequence excised from the pLN-Ypt1p vector36 using NdeI and BamHI sites was subcloned into the pET19bTEV expression vector. To generate the pET19b-Rabex-5 vector, the Rabex-5 fragment was restricted from the pQE30 vector37 and subcloned in the original pET19b vector. Expression and purification of proteins Rab5 was expressed and puri®ed as described.21 Expression and puri®cation of TEV protease was performed as described.38 To express and purify Vps9p, Ypt51p, Ypt51p(W61FW101F), Ypt1p and DSS4 Escherichia coli BL21DE3, cells transformed with the corresponding vectors were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100mg/ml ampicillin at 37  C and induced at an A600  0.7 with 0.1 mM IPTG. After induction, the cells containing the Ypt51p, Ypt51p(W61FW101F) or Ypt1p plasmids were allowed to grow at 37  C for an additional three hours. For the expression of Vps9p and DSS4, the temperature was reduced to 20  C and the cells were harvested after ®ve hours of induction. The expressed proteins have an N-terminal 6 Â His af®nity tag that can be removed by TEV protease. After harvesting the cells by centrifugation, they were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol (for puri®cation of the GTPases, 5 mM magnesium chloride and 5mM GDP were additionally added in all buffers used in the puri®cation procedure) and lysed using a ¯uidizer (Micro¯uidics Corperation). The lysate was clari®ed by ultracentrifugation for one hour at 4  C. The 6 Â His-tagged proteins were puri®ed using Ni-NTA-super¯ow matrix (Qiagen) according to the manifacturer's guidelines. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Fractions containing the proteins were pooled. After ammonium sulphate precipitation (®nal 70 % (w/v)) the protein pellet was resuspended in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. TEV protease (itself containing a 10 Â His N-terminal af®nity tag) was added and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature. After TEVcleavage, the protein solution was passed over a second Ni-NTA column pre-equilibrated with 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 50 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol in order to remove the polyhistidine tags, uncleaved protein and the TEV protease. After concentrating the fractions containing the cleaved protein, the solution was loaded onto a Superdex 75 16/ 60 gel-®ltration column (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 40 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fractions containing pure protein were pooled, concentrated and stored in multiple aliquots at À80  C. Typical purity was over 98 % as judged by Coomassie blue staining and ESI-MS. For Rabex-5, the principal expression and puri®cation protocol was according to that described above but the instability and the low expression level of soluble protein

Ypt/Rab Exchange-factor Kinetics precluded TEV cleavage, and Rabex-5 was used as a His-tagged protein. For the production of soluble Rabex5, the temperature was reduced to 20  C after induction and cells were grown for an additional two hours. The lysis buffer contained 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol and a mixture of the protease inhibitors PMFS, aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin and pepstatin. The His-tagged protein was puri®ed using Ni-NTA-super¯ow matrix (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Eluates were analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialysed against 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Further puri®cation was performed on a Superdex 75 16/60 gel-®ltration column (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The puri®ed protein was used directly for the kinetic experiments, because freezing and storing at À80  C caused inactivation. Nucleotide exchange The tightly bound GDP present in the puri®ed Ypt51p, Rab5 and Ypt1p was exchanged against other nucleotides (mantGDP, mantGppNHp or GppNHp) in the presence of EDTA, followed by gel-®ltration to remove excess nucleotide. Preparation of nucleotide-free GTPases Nucleotide-free Rab5, Ypt51p and Ypt1p were prepared as described.21,22 Labelling of proteins with 5-({[(2-iodoacetyl)amino]ethyl}amino)naphthalene1sulphonic acid (1,5-IAEDANS) Cysteine residues were labelled as described.35 The labelling was analysed by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS. Fluorescence measurements All ¯uorescence measurements were carried out in a buffer containing 40 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol at 25  C. Fluorescence spectra and long-time ¯uorescence measurements were performed with an SLM 8100 spectrophotometer (Amicon, Silver Spring, MD, USA) or with a Fluoroscan Ascent FL 1.8 (Labsystems). Tryptophan ¯uorescence was excited at 290 nm and detected at 340 nm. Fluorescence of mant nucleotides was excited directly at 356 nm or via ¯uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) at 290 nm and detected at 440 nm. For measurement of the dansyl ¯uorescence signal, the dansyl group was excited directly at 364 nm or via FRET at 290 nm and data were collected at 480 nm. Rapid kinetics were examined with a stopped ¯ow apparatus (High Tech Scienti®c, Salisbury, United Kingdom). Excitation of tryptophan ¯uorescence was at 296 nm, with detection through a 320 nm cut-off ®lter. Fluorescence of mant nucleotides was excited either directly at 290 nm or via FRET at 365 nm, with emission through a 389 nm cut-off ®lter. The dansyl ¯uorescence was excited via FRET at 296 nm and detected through a 389 nm cut-off ®lter. Data collection and primary analysis for determination of rate constants were performed with the package from High Tech Scienti®c, while sec-
