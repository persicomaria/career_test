Abstract The multi-subunited structures of high molecular weight hemoglobins isolated from various invertebrates have fascinated structural biologists for decades. A recent crystal structure of Lumbricus terrestris hemoglobin (LtHb) by Royer and co-workers ° provides the best three-dimensional picture of the structural hierarchy to a resolution of 5.5 A. Atomic level models of the tetrameric and dodecameric complexes are derived from homology modeling and molecular mechanics methods. The homology model is based on the Glycera dibranchiata whereas previous models have been based on the b chain of human deoxyhemoglobin, and for the first time, the dodecameric complex is presented in atomic detail. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction For decades, the multi-subunited structures of high-molecular weight hemoglobins isolated from various invertebrates have fascinated and excited structural biochemists. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the 70-year pursuit of the threedimensional structure of Lumbricus terrestris hemoglobin (LtHb), an extracellular oxygen transport

protein found in the coelomic fluid of the common earthworm. Crystals were first reported in the mid19th century [1]. Over the years, many biophysical approaches ranging from classical hydrodynamic studies including sedimentation [2], diffusion and viscosity [3], to light scattering [4 ­ 7], small angle Xray scattering [8], small angle neutron scattering [9], scanning transmission electron microscopy [10], lowresolution X-ray diffraction studies [11,12], and an array of solution spectroscopy studies [13 ­17] have been carried out in order to elucidate its structure and function. All of these studies have provided a more refined picture of the overall quaternary structure of

the giant (, 4 £ 106 Da) and extraordinary L. terrestris hemoglobin molecule (LtHb). The 144 heme-containing chains of LtHb are organized in a structural array revealed as a doublelayered hexagonal structure with an overall D6 symmetry [11,12]. Although in the past there was much debate as to the exact stoichiometry of the heme-containing and linker chains in LtHb, it is composed of multiple copies of four different hemecontaining chains and four different linker chains. A high resolution X-ray crystallographic study is still lacking, but the recent crystal structure of Royer and co-workers [16] provided a significantly more detailed three-dimensional picture of the structural ° hierarchy down to a resolution of 5.5 A. Not only have they provided a focused picture of the complex array of the interacting heme-containing chains, the disulfide-linked trimer (abc0 ) and the monomeric dchain, they have determined the incorporation of these subunits into well-described dodecameric units which are located on the exterior of the native Lumbricus molecule. Using the sequence data for the four hemecontaining chains [18 ­ 20], we have employed several molecular mechanic and modeling approaches to construct high-resolution, three-dimensional structures of the functional tetrameric and dodecameric subunits of LtHb. Working from a sequence homology approach (MOE-homology) and the established myoglobin-like folding within each of the four hemecontaining chains [16], the structural interdigitation of multiple copies of the abc0 trimer and d-chain is presented in a highly resolved molecular visualization.

currently available. Therefore, homology models were constructed based on the three-dimensional structure of Glycera dibranchiata hemoglobin, pdb entry code 2hbg. The degree of sequence homology between G. dibranchiata hemoglobin and the a, b, c0 and d chains of LtHb is 5% identity and 31% similarity at the amino acid level [18,21] (see Fig. 1). Using the alignment of G. dibranchiata hemoglobin with each of the four LtHb chains (a, b, c0 , and d)[18], the homology modeling module of MOE (Chemical Computing Group. INC., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was used to build a three-dimensional model for each chain without the heme. The underlying methodology of MOE-homology is based on a combination of the segment-matching procedure of Levitt [22] and an approach to the modeling of indels based on that of Fechteler [23]. By default, MOE-homology creates 10 models, each of which is generated by making a series of Boltzmann-weighted choices of side chain rotamers and loop conformations from a set of protein fragments selected from the built-in library of high-resolution protein structures. Each of the candidate models are saved in a molecular database for further analysis, while an average model is created and then submitted to a usercontrolled level of potential energy minimization. One can pick any of MOE's standard molecular

mechanics force fields that include two variants of the AMBER force field as well as MMFF94. In this work, the average models were chosen in all the further modeling work. Each of the average models was minimized using the AMBER force field until the RMS gradient was below 0.1 kcal/mol. Fig. 2 illustrates the results from the homology modeling by superimposing ribbon structures of G. dibranchiata hemoglobin with four LtHb chains. One observes from Fig. 2 that there is a high degree of structural identity between the structures. 2.1. Analysis of the LtHb homology model The stereochemical quality of the LtHb model structure can be addressed using a variety of stereochemical parameters. [24,25] Using the Protein Report of MOE, which is based on the PROCHECK program [26], we have analyzed the homology structure. The stereochemical analysis results for LtHb indicates that 85% of the residues are in the core regions of the Ramachandran plot [24]. Residues E2, S29, and D58 of chain c0 have f/c values that lie outside the normal regions of a Ramachandran plot. Having 85% of the residues in the core regions of the Ramachandran plot indicates that the LtHb model should be equivalent to an X-ray structure with a

° resolution less than 3.0 A and an R-factor of 0.28 [24]. Based on this stereochemical analysis, we feel that the LtHb structure is of sufficient quality that it can be used to rationalize our experimental data.

3. Quaternary modeling Starting from the three-dimensional structures for the a, b, c0 , and d chains, quaternary models for the tetrameric and dodecameric complexes were built in the following manner. First, constrained energy minimizations were carried out on the individual chains to bond the cysteine residues which form the known intrachain disulfide bonds [18,27]. Heme units were then placed between the histidine residues identified as proximal and distal

by homology. General energy minimizations were then carried out on each chain with the backbone and heme units frozen. The abc0 d tetramer was then assembled by placement of the four chains in a manner consistent with the visually identifiable features shown in the images of Royer et al. [16] and consistent with the known a ­ b interchain disulfide bond, which was then established by a constrained energy minimization. Energy minimization of the entire tetrameric complex was subsequently carried out with the backbone and heme units frozen. Finally, the dodecameric complex was assembled by visual placement of three copies of the tetramer in the orientation shown by Royer et al. [16]. Constrained minimizations were carried out to generate the a ­ c disulfide bonds that link the three tetrameric

units. An energy minimization of the entire dodecameric complex was carried out with the backbone and hemes frozen. The Quantae/CHARMmw force field [28,29] was

used for all quaternary modeling, and calculations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation. Energy minimizations were carried out in CHARMm PSF mode in the presence of r-dependent dielectric

The superposition was done using only the iron atoms of the respective hemes.

(RDIE ¼ 4), as has been recommended [30]. Protonation of the acidic/basic residues for pH 7 was performed in CHARMm RTF mode. Charges and parameters were as given by the polpro (protein with polar hydrogens) dictionary. Charges for the Fe(III)heme moiety were derived from a Hartree ­ Fock [31]/ 6-311G [32] calculation using GAUSSIAN 98 [33] on a Cray SV1 supercomputer; the SPARTAN program [34] was used to perform a subsequent fit of atomic charges to the electrostatic potential along the 0.002 isodensity surface. 3.1. The LtHb quaternary models The backbone structure of our models of the tetrameric and dodecameric complexes of LtHb are

shown in Figs. 3 and 4(a) and (b), respectively. Visual comparisons can be made with Fig. 2 of Royer et al. [16] The optimized energy of the tetramer is roughly the sum of the energies of the individual chains, indicating that very little strain was introduced into the assembly. Closure of the internal disulfide bonds by constrained optimization was readily achieved for the homology-generated chains; all disulfide inter-Ca ° distances were initially in the range 6.8 ­ 7.0 A. Placement of the hemes between the proximal and distal histidines was easily done as well. The LtHb model was then compared to the Scapharca inaequivalvis(clam) hemoglobin (HbII) X-ray structure (pdb entry code 1SCT). The comparison was done by superimposing the heme irons of the respective structures (see Fig. 5). This entailed using

the following subunit matching: subunit a of LtHb with a of HbII, b of LtHb with b of HbII, c0 of LtHb with a of HbII and d of LtHb with b of HbII. This ° ° resulted in RMSD values of 7.26 A for LtHb a, 6.19 A ° ° for LtHb b, 7.00 A for LtHb b0 and 3.46 A for LtHb d with their respective hemes from clam HbII. There are several regions of similarity in secondary structure between LtHb and HbII. This is evident from Fig. 5, which shows good overlap between subunit d of LtHb and subunit b of HbII (upper right), as well as for subunit a of LtHb and HbII (upper left). Any similarity between these structures is interesting since the subunits of LtHb were built using the structure of G. dibranchiata and the LtHb tetrameric unit was built using molecular visualization and molecular mechanics techniques. As in the human-based homology model of the d chain by Viana et al. [21], all three tryptophans are buried in nonpolar regions. Specifically, Trp128 is in a cavity bounded by Trp14, Leu115, Phe123, Val10, and Val132. The nearest neighbors of Trp14 are Phe18, Ile74, Leu67, Trp128, and Asp71. Trp32, which is near the heme moiety, is bounded by the distal His-94 and the nonpolar residues Phe46, Ile35, Leu31, and Phe107. Also, as in the earlier model of the d-chain, the indole group of Trp32 is perpendicular to the heme, but the center of the indole group is ° ° somewhat closer to the heme iron (7.5 A vs. 8.8 A). Viana et al. [21] have discussed the relevance of these d-chain features to fluorescence data of the monomer and intact molecule.

4. Discussion The basis for the homology approach rests upon the presence of the classical tertiary `myoglobin-like' folding present in each of the heme-containing chains of the LtHb molecule. This is evident in Fig. 2 wherein a high degree of structural identity has been established between the `myoglobin-like' fold of the monomeric G. dibranchiata hemoglobin (used in this study as the basis of the homology approach) and the four heme-containing chains of the LtHb molecule. The tertiary folding of each of these chains have been used in our homology approach in conjunction with the recent X-ray studies of Royer et al. [16] allowing ° for improved resolution (to 3.0 A) of the complex

array of heme-containing subunits that constitute the major functional component of this multimeric hemoglobin. In evaluating the effectiveness of an homology approach to the elucidation of a three-dimensional structure for L. terrestris hemoglobin, two interrelated areas of experimental work ought to be considered: ligand binding behavior and structural stability. The observed physico-chemical properties and biological functions of LtHb are fundamentally linked to the extraordinary structural organization of this large multimeric oxygen transport protein. As an acellular respiratory protein, its function and retention within the coelomic fluid of the earthworm is dependent upon its large molecular size (, 3.6 £ 106 Da), structural and redox stability. The oxygen carrying capacity of LtHb (144 heme-containing chains/molecule) provides sufficient oxygen in vivo, while affording and maintaining appropriate osmotic pressure within the annelid's circulatory system. The binding of oxygen to LtHb is a highly cooperative process. The subunit communication between the heme-containing chains within each major subunit is evident in the empirical Hill coefficients, which range from 2.5 to 7.9 (12 hemecontaining chains) depending upon the pH of the solution and the presence of Ca2þ ions [35]. The extent of subunit interdigitation (abc0 d)3 within each of the major subunits of the dodecameric hierarchical organization is reflected in results from a series of resonance Raman spectral studies on LtHb [17] and small angle X-ray scattering work [36]. In most vertebrate hemoglobins, changes in protein tertiary structure induced by either ligand binding or changes in quaternary state are manifested at the heme as reflected in resonance Raman spectral changes involving the Fe-proximal histidine stretching mode. No such changes are observed for LtHb. The Fehistidine stretching mode and the porphyrin breathing motion in the deoxy, oxy, or CO-photodissociated forms of LtHb and HbA (human hemoglobin A) were studied using pulsed (10 ns) light at 435 nm. In contrast to HbA, a comparison of the spectra of deoxy and photoproduct forms of LtHb revealed minimal differences in the region of the Fe-histidine and p electron distribution in the heme moiety. The spectral frequencies are similar to that observed in the R-state vertebrate hemoglobins. Such average behavior of the

The heme Fe ­ Fe distances of experimental S. inaequivalvis tetrameric hemoglobin (HbII) [38] are shown in parentheses for comparison. In HbII, the iron atoms form a twisted rectangle with a dihedral angle of about 248. Distances are in angstroms.

144 hemes present in LtHb is more closely related to the Raman spectral properties observed in myoglobin [17]. These results suggest that internal tertiary conformational changes are very small during the ligand binding process for LtHb. Further evidence that no significant tertiary structural changes occur during ligand binding is evident from small angle X-ray scattering studies wherein no statistical difference is seen in the radius of gyration and molecular volume of either the oxy (liganded) or deoxy (unliganded) forms of LtHb [36]. The previous studies of Royer and co-workers [37, 38] on the Scapharca inequivalvis (clam) tetrameric hemoglobin (HbII) established an important role for the E and F helices for the necessary subunit communication associated with the observed coop-

erative events of oxygen binding for this hemoglobin. This same type of communication is present within multiple copies of the LtHb tetramer as indicated by the predicted Fe ­Fe distances between the four hemecontaining chains (Fig. 6). The unique distribution and distances associated with the four heme-containing chains (Fig. 6) of the [abc0 d] tetramer may help explain some of the unique redox stability characteristics of LtHb. Recent spectroelectrochemical studies [39,40] have determined that LtHb exhibited positive reduction potentials (þ 112 to þ 61 mV) in marked contrast to the negative potentials determined for the single chain myoglobin and several tetrameric hemoglobins (2 150 to 2 48 mV). The specific location of the heme ­ iron moieties suggests an apparent lack of subunit communication during the redox electron transfer events as evident by the linear Nernst plots (slopes, n < 1) obtained when using several cobalt bis and tris liganded complexes as electron mediators. This lack of redox cooperativity indicates that a one-electron transfer step is involved with each of the hemecontaining chains within the LtHb molecule. These observations are also consistent with Krebs et al. small angle X-ray scattering work [36] mentioned earlier. Over the past several decades many structural investigations have been carried out on intact LtHb molecule under different solution conditions using a variety of biophysical approaches: direct absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy [6], front-face steady-state and lifetime fluorescence spectroscopy [13,15], hydrodynamic measurements [3], and sedimentation [2], light scattering [4,5,7,41], and mass spectrometry [42,43] molecular weight determinations. Many of these studies focused on factors that are associated with molecular integrity of the intact molecule in solution, the nature of the bonding interactions involved in the many subunit interfacial contacts contained within this large multimeric hemoglobin, and its thermal and redox stability [44] in a solution environment. The recent X-ray structural work of Royer and co-workers [16] and the present homology modeling presentation found within this paper have now opened avenues to explain further many of the earlier dynamic solution studies with respect to LtHb's functional and structural uniqueness.
