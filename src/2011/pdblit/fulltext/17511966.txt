During tRNALys3 annealing in HIV-1, tRNALys3 binds to both the primer binding site (PBS) and to an 8 nucleotide base-paired sequence upstream of the PBS known as the primer activation signal (PAS). In protease-negative (Pr(-)) HIV-1, the amount of tRNALys3 annealed by Gag is 35% less than that annealed by mature nucleocapsid (NCp7) in protease-positive (Pr(+)) virions. Gag-annealed tRNALys3 also has a reduced ability to initiate reverse transcription, and binds less tightly to viral RNA than NCp7-annealed tRNALys3. Pr(-) virions containing a constitutively single-stranded PAS (2R mutant), show a significant increase in the ability to initiate reverse transcription with little change in the amount of tRNALys3 annealed. However, the 2R mutant does not achieve levels of RT initiation achieved in Pr(+) virions, and tRNALys3 binding to viral RNA remains weak. Wild type levels of initiation and tRNALys3 binding to viral RNA can only be recovered by transient exposure of Pr(-) or Pr(-)2R viral RNA to NCp7. This suggests that in addition to facilitating annealing of tRNALys3 to the PBS and possible denaturation of the PAS, other functions of NCp7 involved in annealing are required. The effect of an inactive protease and/or the 2R mutation upon tRNALys3 annealing and initiation are also observed when the tRNALys3 is annealed in vitro to wild type or mutant viral RNA using either NCp7 or Gagp6, indicating a direct effect of the 2R mutation upon tRNALys3 annealing. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction In HIV-1, minus-strand viral DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase is initiated by a cellular tRNA, tRNALys3, which binds to sequences in the 5 region of the viral RNA genome (Kleiman, Halwani, and Javanbakht, 2004). These sequences include the primer binding site (PBS), an 18 nucleotide (nt) sequence complementary to the 3 terminal 18 nt of tRNALys3, as well as additional sequences upstream of the PBS within the U5-leader stem/loop domain. For example, an Arich loop located upstream and adjacent to the PBS has been postulated to interact with the tRNALys3 anti-codon loop (Isel et al., 1995, 1993), although a later paper from that group seems to indicate that this interaction may be unique to the unusual HIV-1 MAL isolate (Goldschmidt et al., 2004). Another sequence discovered in U5 region further upstream from the PBS is an 8 nt sequence termed the primer activation signal (PAS), that is complementary to the 5 portion of the

TC arm in tRNALys3, referred to as the anti-PAS in Fig. 1 (Beerens and Berkhout, 2002b; Beerens et al., 2001). Mutations within this region have revealed that the PAS has little effect upon the amount of tRNALys3 annealed, but is important for activating initiation of reverse transcription from the annealed tRNA (Beerens and Berkhout, 2002b; Beerens et al., 2001). The PAS in the U5 region is normally base-paired with complementary RNA sequences in the leader region, and in vitro studies have shown that while mutating the PAS leads to an inhibition of reverse transcription initiation, mutating the complementary strand so as to result in a single-stranded PAS results in a large increase in the initiation of reverse transcription (Beerens et al., 2001). The PAS motif has been shown to be conserved among all HIV-1 isolates (Beerens and Berkhout, 2002a), and a similar interaction between a U5 motif in Rous sarcoma virus and the TC arm in this virus' primer tRNA, tRNATrp, has been reported earlier (Leis et al., 1993; Morris et al., 2002). It has been suggested that regulating the availability of the PAS for hybridizing to tRNALys3 may be a mechanism for preventing premature initiation of reverse transcription during viral assembly, i.e., initiation of reverse transcription may require denaturation of the base-paired PAS (Abbink and Berkhout, 2008). There may also be other structural arrangements of viral RNA required to make the PAS available for annealing to tRNALys3, since it has been reported that

In addition to the interaction between the PBS and anti-PBS, an additional interaction is proposed to occur between the upstream primer activation signal (PAS) and sequences in the 5 part of the TC arm in tRNALys3 (Beerens and Berkhout, 2002b; Beerens et al., 2001).

sequences downstream of the PBS can play a role in influencing the availability of the PAS for annealing (Ooms et al., 2007). Earlier studies have indicated that in protease-negative (Pr(-)) HIV-1, Gag is sufficient for annealing tRNALys3 to the viral RNA (Cen et al., 1999; Feng et al., 1999). However, the placement of tRNALys3 on viral RNA is not optimal, since extension of annealed tRNALys3 by addition of the first deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), dCTP, was reduced by N70% compared to + 1 extension of tRNALys3 in protease-positive (Pr(+)) virions (Cen et al., 2000). In this work, we provide additional evidence that Gag-annealed tRNALys3 binds more weakly to viral RNA than NCp7-annealed tRNALys3 by showing that tRNALys3 annealed by Gag is more readily displaced from the PBS by DNA reverse transcribed from a DNA primer downstream of the PBS. It is possible that the increased ability of annealed tRNALys3 to initiate reverse transcription in Pr(+) viruses may be due to NCp7facilitated increases in the availability of the PAS to anneal with tRNALys3, changes that could involve both denaturation of the PAS and structural changes elsewhere in the RNA. In this work, we have

examined the effect upon tRNALys3 annealing and initiation of reverse transcription in Pr(-) virions containing a constitutively singlestranded PAS, and demonstrate that a single-stranded PAS will result in increases in the initiation of reverse transcription, but cannot achieve wild type levels of annealing and initiation achieved by transient exposure of Pr(-) viral RNA to NCp7. Results Effect of the 2R mutation upon viral genomic RNA and tRNALys3 incorporation, tRNALys3 annealing, and initiation of reverse transcription The primer activation signal (PAS) was first described by Berkhout's laboratory (Beerens and Berkhout, 2002b; Beerens et al., 2001). As shown in Fig. 1A, the PAS represents an 8 base sequence lying upstream of the PBS that is normally double-stranded, and which is complementary to an 8 base sequence in the 5 portion of the TC arm in tRNALys3, termed the anti-PAS (Fig. 1B). Evidence has been

presented that annealing to the PAS results in more efficient initiation from reverse transcription from the tRNALys3 primer, without significantly increasing the amount of tRNALys3 annealed (Beerens and Berkhout, 2002b; Beerens et al., 2001). The 2R mutation shown in Fig. 1C is created by replacing sequences in the right strand complementary to the PAS with identical sequences to the PAS, thereby producing a constitutively single-stranded PAS. This mutation in Pr(+) virions was previously reported to result in significant increase in initiation of reverse transcription in vitro (Beerens et al., 2001). Since tRNALys3 annealed by NCp7 in Pr(+) virions also shows an increase in the ability to initiate reverse transcription compared to tRNALys3 annealed by Gag in Pr(-) virions (Cen et al., 2000), we have determined if this is a result of denaturation of the PAS by NCp7 by examining the effect of the 2R mutation on annealing and initiation in Pr(-) viruses. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids coding for Pr(+) or Pr(-) HIV-1, which did, or did not, contain the 2R mutation. The effect of the 2R mutation on the viral genomic RNA/CAp24 were compared separately for Pr(+) and Pr(-) virions because of different sensitivities of anti-CAp24 to mature CAp24 vs capsid sequences within Gag. The results shown in the table in Fig. 2A indicate that the 2R mutation has a very minor effect upon viral RNA packaging in either Pr(+) or Pr(-) viruses. When dot blots of total viral RNA were annealed with 3-32P-end-labeled DNA probes complementary to

either viral genomic RNA or tRNALys3, the results shown in the table in Fig. 2A indicate little if any change in the incorporation of tRNALys3 into viruses as a result of either the protease or 2R mutations. Initiation of reverse transcription was measured in an in vitro reverse transcription assay that extends the tRNALys3 by 6 nt, using total viral RNA as the source of primer tRNALys3 annealed to viral RNA in vivo (see the cartoon in Fig. 2B). tRNALys3 was extended by 6 bases in the presence of excess dNTPs, including -32P-dGTP, with ddATP replacing dATP. In Fig. 2C, we have examined the effect of the 2R mutation upon tRNALys3-primed initiation of reverse transcription in both Pr(+) and Pr(-) virions. Fig. 2C, left upper panel, shows the 1D PAGE resolution of radioactive reaction products. The +6 nt extension of tRNALys3 from different viruses, relative to that obtained for (Pr+) virions, is graphed in Fig. 2C, left lower panel. (Pr+) 2R produces a small increase in extension over (Pr+). (Pr-) shows a significant decrease in priming ability (65% of (Pr+)), while the 2R mutant in (Pr-) increases priming ability to 87% of (Pr+). These +6 extension reactions contain equal amounts of genomic RNA, as initially determined by dot blot hybridization. To further determine that the variation in tRNALys3 priming is not due to variation in the amounts of viral genomic RNA used, equal amounts of viral genomic RNA, as determined from dot blot hybridizations, were also tested for their ability to extend by 6 nt a 30 mer DNA oligomer primer annealed at room temperature to the viral RNA (see Materials and methods

section). Fig. 2C, left middle panel (control), shows that equal amounts of viral RNA in the reaction, as determined by dot blot hybridization, produce equal amounts of DNA-primed extension products, and demonstrates that the variations in tRNALys3 priming seen in the upper left panel are not due to variation in the amount of viral RNA used. As we have previously reported (Cen et al., 2000), the + 6 nt extension assay contains an excess of dNTPs which hides more subtle differences in the ability of tRNALys3 to initiate reverse transcription when annealing of the tRNALys3 has occurred in either a proteasenegative or protease-positive environment. Such differences can be detected when the first dNTP incorporated, dCTP, is present at suboptimal quantities in the reverse transcription assay. This is shown in Fig. 2D, in which the initiation of reverse transcription is measured using total viral RNA as the source of primer/template, and which occurs in the presence of only one dNTP, 0.16 M -32P-dCTP. Fig. 2D shows the 1D PAGE resolution of tRNALys3 extended by one base in the in vitro reverse transcription system (upper right panel), and a graph of the amount of dCTP incorporation relative to Pr(+) (lower right panel). The ability of protease-negative viruses to incorporate dCTP is reduced to less than 20% of that found for viral RNA from protease-positive viruses. The presence of a constitutively denatured PAS (2R mutation) in either Pr(+) or Pr(-) virions greatly increases the ability of the tRNALys3 to be extended by one base, with almost a 2 fold increase for Pr(+)2R over that in Pr(+), and a 5 fold increase for Pr(-)2R over that found for Pr(-). It is not clear why the 2R mutation induces the large increase in + 1 nt extension in Pr(+) viruses, but this may be due to an incomplete denaturation of the PAS in Pr(+). The increase in + 1 extension in Pr(-)2R does not reach wild type (Pr(+)) levels. tRNALys3 annealing measured by the primer binding site occupancy assay The question remains whether these increases in initiation of reverse transcription (either +6 nt or + 1 nt extension) caused by the 2R mutation are the results of an increase in the amount of tRNALys3 annealed or an optimization of tRNALys3 placement on the viral RNA genome. We examined this using the PBS occupancy assay, the results of which are shown in Fig. 3. This assay more directly measures tRNALys3 annealing by determining the fraction of primer binding sites (PBSs) occupied by tRNALys3. A cartoon of the experimental strategy is shown in Fig. 3A. A 5-32P-end-labeled DNA primer (28 nt) is annealed to a sequence in total viral RNA 139 nt downstream of the PBS, and is then extended with HIV-1 RT. Full length extension will give a labeled 365 nucleotide product, but tRNALys3 annealed at the PBS will block extension, resulting in a 167 nucleotide product. Resolution of these products by 1D PAGE is shown in Fig. 3B, with the percentage of the PBSs that are occupied (167 nucleotide product/167 + 365 nucleotide products) listed below each lane. In Pr(+) viruses, PBS occupancy is 79%. This value may be considered a minimum value since we do not know if the block to elongation by tRNALys3 annealed to the PBS is 100% efficient. On the other hand, since we have previously shown in an in vitro tRNALys3 annealing system that PBS occupancy is only 1% when tRNALys3 is absent in a system containing both synthetic viral RNA and NCp7 (Guo et al., 2007), it is not likely that an unoccupied PBS is in a configuration that can partially block RT elongation. The value of the PBS occupancy in Pr(+) 2R, relative to that found in Pr(+), indicates that the 2R mutation has a small negative effect upon PBS occupancy in Pr(+) virions. Therefore, the large 2R-induced increase in initiation of reverse transcription seen in Fig. 2D is not due to an increase in the amount of tRNALys3 annealed, but more likely due to more optimal placement of the tRNALys3 on the viral genome that allows for more efficient initiation. This conclusion is similar to that reached previously by the Berkhout laboratory (Beerens and Berkhout, 2002b; Beerens et al., 2001).

Fig. 3. Measurements of the occupancy of the primer binding site by tRNALys3 in protease-positive and protease-negative HIV-1, lacking or containing the 2R mutation. Total viral RNA from Pr(+) or Pr(-) virions, containing or not containing the 2R mutation, were used to determine primer binding site occupancy by tRNALys3. (A) Cartoon showing the strategy used to measure the percentage of the PBSs occupied with tRNALys3. A 5-32P end-labeled DNA primer (28 nt) was annealed 139 bases downstream of the PBS in viral RNA, and extended with reverse transcription. The fulllength extension product is 365 nt, while a truncated product, resulting from blocked extension by the presence of tRNALys3 on the PBS, is 167 nt. (B) Separation of the fulllength and truncated extension products by 1D PAGE. The ratio of truncated product: truncated and full-length product, × 100 = the percentage of PBSs occupied by tRNALys3, which is listed at the bottom of each lane.

The + 6 nt extension data seen in Fig. 2C suggests that the amount of tRNALys3 annealed to viral RNA isolated from Pr(-) viruses is 65% that of the value found in Pr(+) virions, and that the much lower +1 nt extension (18% that of the value found in Pr(+) virions (Fig. 2D)) may therefore be due to a non-optimal placement of the annealed tRNALys3 on the viral RNA that lessens its ability to incorporate the first nucleotide, dCTP. This proposed weaker binding of tRNALys3 to viral RNA in protease-negative viruses is also supported by measurements of PBS occupancy in protease-negative viruses. For while the amount of annealed tRNALys3 may only be reduced 35% in protease-negative virions (Fig. 2C), the amount annealed as measured by the PBS occupancy assay is reduced 76%, suggesting that the tRNALys3 annealed in Pr(-) virions is more readily displaced by the extension from the downstream DNA primer than is annealed tRNALys3 in Pr(+) virions. This reduction in occupancy is not influenced by the presence or absence of the 2R mutation, i.e., while the 2R mutation causes a significant increase in the ability of tRNALys3 to be extended by dCTP (Fig. 2D), the tRNALys3 placement on the viral RNA still appears weak.

Rescue of tRNALys3 annealing and initiation by transient exposure of Pr(-) viral RNA to NCp7 Since NCp7 might affect tRNALys3 conformation in other ways, we next determined if this apparent weaker binding of tRNALys3 to RNA from Pr(-) or Pr(-)2R virions could be rescued by transient exposure to NCp7. These results are shown in Fig. 4. Total viral RNAs isolated from Pr(+), Pr(+)2R, Pr(-), or Pr(-)2R were transiently exposed to increasing concentrations of NCp7, and further deproteinized before using the RNA in the reverse transcription reaction. Fig. 4A shows that exposure to increasing concentrations of NCp7

the 2R mutation improves initiation of reverse transcription from tRNALys3 annealed by either Gagp6 or NCp7. The patterns seen in Fig. 5 are very similar to those obtained using total viral RNA isolated from 2R mutants in Pr(+) or Pr(-) viruses as the source of tRNALys3 annealed in vivo (Figs. 2C, D), and show a direct relationship between the PAS in the viral RNA and the ability of annealed tRNALys3 to initiate reverse transcription. And, as with tRNALys3 annealed in vivo, the 2R mutation is not sufficient to rescue initiation to wild type levels. Discussion In this work, the ability of annealed tRNALys3 to initiate reverse transcription is studied using two reaction conditions that will allow either a 6 nt extension or a 1 nt extension of annealed tRNALys3. Measurements of the 6 nt extension reveal the amount of tRNALys3 annealed, since under the conditions used, the concentrations of all dNTPs (including the -32P-GTP used) are not limiting for the + 6 extension (Cen et al., 2000). Furthermore, in Pr(+) virions, relative changes in tRNALys3 binding resulting from the 2R mutation are similar whether measured by the +6 nt extension or the PBS occupancy assay. In the conditions for the + 1 nt extension, used to measure different configurations of annealed tRNALys3, we have

(B) Occupancy of the primer binding site by tRNALys3. As described for Fig. 3, a 5-32P-end-labeled DNA primer (28 nt) was annealed 139 bases downstream of the PBS in viral RNA, and extended with reverse transcription.

has no effect upon tRNALys3 +1 initiation of reverse transcription for either Pr(+) or Pr(+)2R, which is to be expected since RNA from both viral types has already been exposed to NCp7 in vivo. On the other hand, transient exposure of viral RNA from Pr(-) or Pr(-)2R, which were not exposed to NCp7 in vivo, does result in increases of +1 initiation to levels achieved in Pr(+) and Pr(+)2R viruses, respectively. Furthermore, upon exposure to NCp7 of viral RNA from Pr(-) virions (containing or not containing the 2R mutation), NCp7 rescues PBS occupancy (Fig. 4B). Thus, while the 2R mutation is unable is prevent tRNALys3 from being displaced in the PBS occupancy assay, transient exposure to NCp7 appears to strengthen tRNALys3 binding to viral RNA. Effects of the 2R mutation upon annealing and initiation of reverse transcription from tRNALys3 annealed by Gagp6 or NCp7 in vitro The data obtained using Pr(+) and Pr(-) assumes that the 2R mutation is having its effect upon NCp7-annealed and Gag-annealed tRNALys3, respectively. To show this directly, we examined the effect of the 2R mutation upon initiation of reverse transcription from tRNALys3 annealed in vitro by either Gag or NCp7. The results shown in Fig. 5 are very similar to what we find for tRNALys3 annealed in vivo. In Fig. 5, purified tRNALys3 is annealed to synthetic viral RNA using either NCp7 or Gagp6, and the ability of tRNALys3 to be extended by either 6 nt (A) or 1 nt (B) is examined. Figs. 5A, B show that the +6 or + 1 nt extensions of tRNALys3 are significantly reduced when tRNALys3 is annealed by Gag compared to annealing facilitated by NCp7, and that

Purified human placental tRNALys3 and synthetic viral RNA, wild type (WT) or containing the 2R mutation, was incubated with either NCp7 or Gagp6 as described in Materials and methods. The resulting tRNALys3/viral RNA complex was then deproteinized, and used as a source of primer/template in the in vitro reverse transcription system, where the tRNALys3 was extended by either + 6 (A) or + 1 (B) nt, as described in Materials and methods. Quantitation of the results, relative to wild type viral RNA, is presented in the lower part of each panel.

shown that the use of 0.16 M dCTP is insufficient for obtaining the maximum 1 nt extension of tRNALys3, which requires 5.0 M dCTP, and equal amounts of tRNALys3 annealed in Pr(+) and Pr(-) viruses show different abilities to incorporate dCTP (Cen et al., 2000). The fact that the increases in both +6 and +1 nt extension caused by the 2R mutation (Fig. 2) do not correlate with the lack of change in binding ability of tRNALys3 observed using the PBS occupancy assay (Fig. 3) might indicate that the extension and occupancy data are not quantitatively comparable. But this is unlikely based upon published data on the effect of APOBEC3G (A3G) on the NCp7-catalyzed annealing of tRNALys3 to viral RNA in vitro (Guo et al., 2007). In that report, we showed that the presence of A3G in virions reduced + 6 extension 70­80%, and PBS occupancy 80­84%. Furthermore, A3G reduces the amount of 32P-tRNALys3 annealed by NCp7 in vitro 55%. Thus, all three assays give similar results. On the other hand, experiments rescuing +1 nt extension by either NCp7 or the 2R mutation most likely reflect changes in the configuration of tRNALys3 annealed to viral RNA. Thus, we have previously shown that the changes in +1 nt initiation of reverse transcription due to exposure of Pr(-) RNA to NCp7 is not the result of an increased binding of tRNALys3 to the viral RNA (Cen et al., 2000). It was shown in that work that the addition of NCp7 to total viral RNA isolated from Pr(-) virus does not result in any change in either +6 nt extension, or in +1 nt extension using 5.0 M dCTP. For while it was shown in that paper that 0.16 M dCTP is suboptimal for RT initiation, both 5.0 M dCTP (+ 1 nt extension) and the NTP concentrations used during +6 nt extension are optimal, and these NTP concentrations appear to be able to overcome configurational changes that can only be detected by using suboptimal concentrations of dCTP. Therefore, another explanation must be sought for why the denaturation of the PAS (2R mutation) can cause increased initiation in Pr(-) viruses (though not reaching Pr(+) levels), and still not change the ability of tRNALys3 to bind more stongly to viral RNA, something only accomplished by exposure of RNA to NCp7. The answer may be that the ability of tRNALys3 to capture the first dCTP is not a complete measure of the configurational state of tRNALys3 annealed to viral RNA, and the ability of annealed tRNALys3 to be displaced may be a more sensitive measure of optimal configuration. The ability of NCp7, and not the 2R mutation, to rescue this configuration could be due to one or more possibilities. First, the configuration of the PAS denatured by mutations that produce an identical anti-PAS strand may not be the same as the wild type PAS sequences denatured by NCp7. Second, in addition to the possible role of NCp7 in facilitating annealing to the largely, if not entirely, single-stranded PBS through promoting nucleation, a denaturation of the PAS by NCp7 might also require NCp7-facilitated RNA conformation changes downstream of the PBS that would be important for regulating the availability of the PAS for annealing to tRNALys3 (Ooms et al., 2007). Third, NCp7 has been reported to play a role in blocking the interaction between the TC and D loops of tRNALys3, which would result in a destabilization of the tertiary structure of tRNALys3, which might also help promote optimum annealing (Hargittai et al., 2001; Tisne et al., 2001). While both the in vivo and in vitro works reported here indicate that the effects of the 2R mutation upon tRNALys3 annealing and initiation are direct, mutations in this region of viral RNA may also have additional effects upon other processes in HIV-1 replication. Thus, even though the 2R mutation in wild type viruses results in a modest increase in the initiation of reverse transcription, it has nevertheless been reported that the 2R mutation causes a 50­55% reduction in the production of protease-positive HIV-1 (CAp24) from transfected C33A cells (Beerens and Berkhout, 2002b). We have also found that the 2R mutation produces a similar reduction viral production in transfected 293T cells producing either Pr(+)2R or Pr(-)2R virions (data not shown). It may be that a strict

regulation of reverse transcription initiation is important for overall viral replication, or perhaps the wild type anti-PAS sequence mutated here is required for binding cell factors required for viral production. Materials and methods Plasmids BH10 is a simian virus 40-based vector that contains full-length wild type BH10 strain of HIV-1 proviral DNA (termed Pr(+) viruses), while BH10P- contains an inactive viral protease (D25G), and produces Pr(-) viruses. BH102R and BH10P-2R constructs were generated by mutating the region containing the "right" sequences that are complementary to the PAS sequence in the stem 2 of the U5leader stem in HIV-1 viral RNA genome (see Fig. 1). A NarI­SpeI DNA fragment (DNA nucleotide positions 637 to 1511) of HIV-1, encompassing the 5-PBS, leader and the 5-end of the gag gene, was PCR amplified from BH10P- using the following two primers containing SalI and SpeI sites, respectively: psvk forward PAS 5-TAATTTGTCGACGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACCTGAAAGCG-3and psvk reverse PAS 5GC GGCGACTAGTAGTTCCTGCCTATGTCATTCC-3. This fragment was then cloned into the SalI and SpeI sites in pSVK3 plasmid (Amersham). This NarI­SpeI fragment in pSVK3 subclone was used to construct the 2R mutation in a pSVK3 background using an in vitro site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and using the following two HPLC purified primers: forward 2R: 5-GACCTGAAAGCGAAAGGGAATGGTCTCGAGCTCTCTCGACGCAGGAC-3; Reverse 2R: 5-GTCCTGCGTCGAGAGAGCTCGAGACCATTCCCTTTCGCTTTCAGGTC-3. The 2R mutation was verified by sequencing using the following primer: psvk forward 5-GTAATG TGGCTACCAGAAAATGTAAATTCG-3. Subsequently, the mutated NarI­SpeI fragment containing the 2R mutation was then excised from pSVK3 using NarI and SpeI, and was reintroduced into either BH10 or BH10P- backgrounds generating BH102R and BH10P-2R. The final clones were verified by sequencing using the following primer: PAS forward 5-GGGAG CTCTCTGGCTAACTAGGGAACCC-3. Protein production HIV-1 RT, purified from bacteria as previously described (Huang et al., 1996), was a gift from Matthias Gotte (McGill University). Recombinant wild type NCp7 was a gift from R. Gorelick, and was prepared as previously described (Carteau et al., 1999; Guo et al., 2002), including purification by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography after denaturing the protein in 8 M guanidine hydrochloride. Gagp6 was a gift from A. Rein, and was prepared as previously described (Cen et al., 2000). Gagp6 was used because it is easier to purify than full-length Gag, its assembly properties in vitro have been characterized (Campbell and Rein, 1999), and it can efficiently facilitate annealing of tRNALys3 to viral RNA (Feng et al., 1999). Cells, transfections and virus purification HEK-293T cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin, and 100 g of streptomycin/ml. For the production of viruses, HEK-293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Supernatant was collected 48 h post-transfection. Viruses were pelleted from culture medium by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 1 h. The viral pellets were then purified by 15% sucrose onto a 65% sucrose cushion. The band of purified virus was removed and pelleted in 1× TNE (20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 1 h.

Viral RNA isolation and quantification Total viral RNA was extracted from viral pellets using the guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure as previously described in Huang et al. (1994) and was dissolved in 5 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5. As previously described (Cen et al., 2000), hybridization to dot blots of total viral RNA was carried out with 5-32P-end-labeled DNA probes complementary to either the 3-terminal 18 nucleotides of tRNALys3 (5-TGGCGCCCGAACAGGGAC-3), or to the 5 end of the HIV-1 genomic RNA, just upstream of the PBS (5-CTGACGCTCTCGCACCC-3). In addition to dot blot analysis for determining the amount of viral RNA used in each RT reaction mixture, the relative amounts of viral RNA in the reaction mixtures were also determined by measuring the ability of a 30-mer DNA (complementary to BH10 DNA nucleotides 801-830 (5-TCTAATTCT CCCCCGCTTAATACTGACGCT-3) annealed at room temperature to the viral RNA to prime synthesis of a 6-base deoxynucleotide triphosphate extension, using the same reaction conditions as for measuring tRNALys3 priming, as previously described (Guo et al., 2007). tRNALys3-primed initiation of reverse transcription Total viral RNA isolated from virus produced in transfected 293T cells was used as the source of a primer tRNA annealed in vivo to viral RNA in an in vitro reverse transcription reaction as previously described (Huang et al., 1996). Briefly, total viral RNA was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in 20 l of RT buffer (50 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing 50 ng purified HIV RT, 10 U of RNasin and various deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). To measure the ability of annealed tRNALys3 to be extended by six deoxyribonucleotides, the RT reaction mixture contained 200 M dCTP, 200 M dTTP, 5 Ci of [-32P] dGTP (0.16 M), and 50 M ddATP. To measure the ability of annealed tRNALys3 to be extended by one deoxyribonucleotide, the RT reaction mixture contained only 0.16 M -32P-dCTP. Reaction products were resolved using onedimensional (1D) 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) containing 7 M urea (Huang et al., 1996). Transient exposure of viral RNA to NCp7 involved exposing total viral RNA for 30 min at 37 °C to 0, 4, or 10 pmol of NCp7. Deproteinization was performed through the addition of 1 l proteinase K (5 mg/ml) to the reactions, which were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction to remove both proteinase K and digested residual proteins. The viral RNA complex was ethanol precipitated, dried, and used in the reverse transcriptase reaction. In vitro annealing of tRNALys3 to viral RNA Human placental tRNALys3 was hybridized with synthetic HIV-1 viral genomic RNA, wild type or containing the 2R mutation. The tRNALys3 was purified from human placenta as previously described (Jiang et al., 1993), using standard chromatography procedures (sequentially DEAE-Sephadex A-50, reverse-phase chromatography (RPC-5), and Porex C4) and, finally, two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). The wild type synthetic genomic RNA (497 nt), comprising the complete R and U5 regions, the PBS, leader, and part of the gag coding region, was synthesized as previously described (Huang et al., 1996) from the AccI-linearized plasmid pHIVPBS (Arts et al., 1994) with the MEGA-script transcription system (Ambion Inc.). The mutant genomic RNA containing the 2R mutation was synthesized from a PCR amplified BH102R fragment with MEGAscript transcription system (Ambion, Inc.). The forward PCR primer is at the beginning of the R region in the LTR, and contains the T7promoter at its 5-terminus: 5-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCTCTCTGGT TAGAC-3. The reverse primer is located at N-terminal

of the gag coding region: 5-CAGCCT TCTGATGTTTCTAACAGG-3. The synthetic 2R mutant genomic RNA (504 nt) comprises the complete R and U5 region, the PBS, the leader, and part of gag coding region. tRNALys3 annealing to viral RNA was facilitated by either the addition of NCp7 or Gagp6 as previously described (Cen et al., 2000). 1 pmol of tRNALys3 was annealed to 1 pmol of synthetic HIV-1 RNA template by incubating these reagents at 37 °C for 90 min with 30 pmol of NCp7 or Gagp6 in a 10 l reaction mixture containing (50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT) and 10 U of RNasin. tRNALys3 occupation of the PBS A 28 nt DNA oligomer (5-CCCCGCTTAATACTGACGCTCTCGCACC-3) was 5-end-labeled with 32P using T4 kinase and was complementary to sequences in HIV-1 RNA genome 139 base downstream of the PBS. The complex was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 20 l of RT buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM DTT) containing 50 ng HIV RT, 10 U of RNasin, 200 M deoxynucleoside triphosphates, The reaction products, either fulllength (365 nt) or truncated (167 nt, due to occupation of the PBS by tRNALys3), were resolved using 1D 6% PAGE with gels containing 7M Urea.
