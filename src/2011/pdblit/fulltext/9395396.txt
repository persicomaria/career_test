the COOH-terminus of the XIP3R protein (8). The mAbs to XIP3R were isolated by fusion of the P3U1 myeloma cell line P3x63AgU1 with spleen cells derived from BALB/c mice immunized with glutathioneS-transferase­XIP3R fusion protein. Initial screenings were done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with TrpE-XIP3R fusion proteins. The serum-free culture supernatant of hybridoma cell lines and commercial mouse IgG used as controls were affinity purified with Ampure IgG purification kits (Amersham), followed by dialysis against injection buffer (88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 15 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.5). With the assumption that the volume of the 2-cell stage embryo is 1 l [Y. Chen, L. Huang, M. Solursh, Dev. Biol. 161, 70 (1994)], injection of antibody at 20 ng per embryo into the VMZs of 4-cell stage embryos resulted in the estimated final concentration of mAb of 40 g/ml. S. Kume et al., Dev. Biol. 182, 228 (1997 ). The release of Ca2 from microsomes of Xenopus oocytes by the addition of 100 nM IP3 was measured. The amount of IICR was normalized to the amplitude of the Ca2 release in the presence of control mouse IgG [A. Muto, S. Kume, T. Inoue, H. Okano, K. Mikoshiba, J. Cell Biol. 135, 181 (1996)]. K. Fukuda et al., Nature 327, 623 (1987 ). The Ca2 indicator dye Fura 2 (Molecular Probe) (20 M) and m1AChR mRNA (13 ng per embryo) were micro-injected at the 2-cell stage, and then mAb (40 ng per embryo) was injected at the animal poles. Animal pole blastomeres were cut off between the 32- to 128-cell stage. Changes in the fluorescence intensities excited at 340 and 380 nm upon carbachol addition (100 M) were recorded and analyzed.

To obtain more precise information about the sequence that the inhibitory mAbs recognize, we synthesized a candidate epitope of a 12-residue-long peptide with the sequence GQPAHLNINPQQ (corresponding to residues 2680 to 2691, at the COOH terminal of XIP3R) (8) (Peptide Institute). Both ELISA and protein immunoblot analysis revealed that binding of the mAbs 11B12 and 1G9, but not 7F11, to XIP3R was inhibited in the presence of this peptide (15).

Our result that the expression of the ventral homeobox gene Xvent-1, a downstream component of BMP4 (24), was eliminated by 1G9 injection suggests that the expression of Xvent-1 may be positively regulated by the IP3-Ca2 signaling system. Our present results show that the inhibition of the IP3-Ca2 signaling pathway induced the expression of noggin and chordin genes (Fig. 3). The up-regulation of these BMP4 antagonists by 1G9 injection suggests a negative regulation of these genes by the IP3-Ca2 signaling system, either directly or through negative cross-regulatory loops, as described between Xvent-2 and goosecoid [D.

Crystal Structure of the Adenylyl Cyclase Activator Gs
Roger K. Sunahara, John J. G. Tesmer, Alfred G. Gilman, Stephen R. Sprang*
The crystal structure of Gs , the heterotrimeric G protein subunit that stimulates adenylyl cyclase, was determined at 2.5 Å in a complex with guanosine 5 -O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP S). Gs is the prototypic member of a family of GTP-binding proteins that regulate the activities of effectors in a hormone-dependent manner. Comparison of the structure of Gs GTP S with that of Gi GTP S suggests that their effector specificity is primarily dictated by the shape of the binding surface formed by the switch II helix and the 3- 5 loop, despite the high sequence homology of these elements. In contrast, sequence divergence explains the inability of regulators of G protein signaling to stimbinding surface of Gs is largely conserved in ulate the GTPase activity of Gs . The sequence and structure to that of Gi , whereas differences in the surface formed by the carboxyl-terminal helix and the 4- 6 loop may mediate receptor specificity.

ic G protein subunits, although highly homologous, differ profoundly with respect to effector, regulator, and receptor specificity (1, 2). For example, Gs binds to and activates all isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (3), whereas Gi 1 and its close paralogs inhibit only certain isoforms of the effector. The GTPase activities of Gi subfamily members are stimulated by members of the RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) protein family; the GTPase activity of Gs is not affected by any known RGS protein (4). Distinct subfamilies of G protein­coupled receptors activate either Gs or Gi. To better understand the origins of these funcR. K. Sunahara and A. G.

tional differences, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of GTP S-activated Gs alone and in complex with its effector, adenylyl cyclase (5). Comparison of the structure of Gs with those of previously determined Gi subfamily members (6, 7) offers substantial insight into the molecular basis of specificity in heterotrimeric G proteins. Deficiencies in Gs function have serious biological repercussions. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation of the active site residue Arg201 by cholera toxin (8, 9) leads to irreversible inhibition of the GTPase activity of Gs . The resulting constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase in gastrointestinal epithelium is responsible for the diarrhea and dehydration that are the hallmarks of cholera. Similarly, mutation of Arg201 or the catalytic residue Gln227 contributes to the growth of tumors of the pituitary and thyroid glands and causes the McCune-Albright syndrome (10, 11). Heterozygous deficiency of Gs is the basis for pseudohypoparathyroidism (type IA) (11­13).

The structure of the active Gs GTP S complex was determined at 2.5 Å resolution by molecular replacement with the use of the atomic coordinates of Gi GTP S (7) as the search model (Table 1). The structure has been refined to conventional and free crystallographic R factors of 23 and 29%, respectively. Each asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a nonphysiological Gs dimer oriented parallel to the a axis of the crystal. The dimer interface buries 2500 Å2 of surface area and is additionally stabilized by 10 phosphate anions derived from the crystallization medium. These phosphates contribute an additional 900 Å2 of buried surface area (Fig. 1A). Residues 1 through 33 and 392 through 394 (of 394 residues; the numbering is based on the long alternative splice variant) are disordered at the

NH2- and COOH-termini of the crystal structure. Residues 65 through 88 of subunit A and residues 70 through 86 of subunit B in linker 1 of the protein are also disordered. Gs , like its homologs Gi (7) and Gt (6), consists of a Ras-like domain joined through two linker polypeptides to an helical domain that is unique to heterotrimeric G proteins (2). The structure of the -helical domain of Gs , expressed as a recombinant protein, has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (14) and is virtually identical to that of the corresponding domain in the intact subunit [root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.2 Å for 113 pairs of C atoms]. Both NMR and crystal structures demonstrate that the BC loop is poorly ordered and that the

proline at position 115 adopts the cis conformation. Relative to Gi and Gt , Gs contains three major polypeptide insertions (Fig. 1, B and C). The first of these (i1) is near the NH2-terminus and is not visible in the Gs structure. The second (i2) is incorporated into the linker 1 peptide (connecting 1 to A). However, this insert is subject to alternative splicing; in the short splice variant of Gs described here, linker 1 is only one residue longer than that in Gi . Unlike Gi , linker 1 in Gs is partially disordered. The third (i3) is a 15-residue insertion between G and 4 of the Raslike domain. The i3 insertion folds into a flap that protrudes from the surface of the domain (Fig. 1B) and forms most of the noncrystallographic dimer interface. Conformational differences between the helical

(A) A dimer of Gs GTP S was observed in the asymmetric unit of the crystals and is depicted here as a ribbon and coil diagram looking down the noncrystallographic twofold axis. The 16 phosphate anions are drawn as red tetrahedrons. Most of the anions bind within a groove at the dimer interface between the 5 helices. The two phosphate anions that bind near the NH2-termini of each molecule of Gs form crystal contacts. GTP S (yellow) and Mg2 (black) are represented by ball-andstick models and are located in the nucleotide binding pocket. Helices are green, strands are purple, and coils are gray. This and the other ribbon diagrams were generated with MOLSCRIPT (40) and rendered with RASTER3D (41). (B) Superposition of Gi (transparent rose) on the structure of Gs GTP S (solid gray). Only the nucleotide bound to Gs is shown. The approximate locations of two of the three major insertions in the Gs sequence relative to Gi (i2 and i3) are indicated in white (see text). The two proteins superimpose with a rmsd of 1.0 Å for 260 C atom pairs. Their structures are essentially identical at the GTP binding site and are most divergent in various loops at the periphery of the molecule, most notably at the 3- 5 and 4- 6 loops.

REPORTS
domains of Gs and those of Gi and Gt have been noted previously (7, 14). None of these differences involve regions of the subunit that participate in interactions with (for Gi and Gt ) (15, 16), RGS proteins (for Gi ) (17), or adenylyl cyclase (for Gs ) (5). In contrast, structural variations among these subunits in the 3- 5 and 4- 6 loops of the Ras-like domains (Fig. 2) are determinants of effector specificity (see below). GTP is the organizing center for three switch elements (switches I through III) (Fig. 1, B and C) in G that undergo substantial conformational rearrangement upon GTP hydrolysis. These switch elements are also intimately involved in binding , RGS family members, and effectors (5, 15­17). The structure and orientation of all three switch elements are essentially identical in Gs GTP S, Gi GTP S (Fig. 1B), and Gt GTP S. The nucleotide is bound within the narrow cleft formed by switch I and switch II (Fig. 1, A and B), exactly as observed in the structures of the other G homologs. Indeed, the side chains that contact GTP S and coordinate Mg2 are identical to the corresponding residues in Gi . Electron densities corresponding to Mg2 , one of its coordinating water molecules, and the presumptive hydrolytic water are observed. The second water ligand to Mg2 is, however, evident in the Gs adenylyl cyclase complex (5). Arg201, which facilitates GTP hydrolysis by stabilizing the proposed pentavalent phosphate intermediate (7, 18) and is the site of ADP ribosylation by cholera toxin (8, 9), is exposed to solvent and partially ordered. Gln227, which is conserved in most members of the Ras superfamily and is required for catalytic activity in heterotrimeric G proteins, forms no direct contacts with either the -thiophosphate of GTP S or the presumptive hydrolytic water. This is also the case in the structures of other Ras superfamily members bound to GTP analogs (2). Of all G homologs, only Gs and Golf activate adenylyl cyclase. It is evident from the structure of the complex between Gs and the catalytic domains of adenylyl cyclase (5) that exclusion of Gi from this site arises primarily from differences in the conformation, but not the amino acid composition, of the cyclase binding site. Residues that bind adenylyl cyclase are located in the 2 helix of switch II and the 3- 5 loop (5) (Figs. 1C and 3). Both segments were identified as potential adenylyl cyclase binding sites by alanine- and homolog-scanning mutagenesis (19, 20). Of the nine Gs side chains that directly interact with adenylyl cyclase, seven are invariant or highly conserved among the Gs and Gi proteins (Fig. 1C). The exceptions, Gln236 and Asn239, are replaced by histidine and glutamic acid, respectively. The side chain of Asn239 stacks against the guanidinium group of Arg913 of type II adenylyl cyclase, and Gln236 serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor from Asn905. The corresponding amino acid side chains in Gi could potentially participate in analogous interactions. Indeed, mutation of these residues in Gs , along with Asp240, to their counterparts in Gi , results in only a threefold reduction in the capacity to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity (20). It is more likely that Gi fails to activate adenylyl cyclase because its 35 loop is displaced from the switch II helix, so that both elements cannot be simultaneously accommodated by the cyclase binding site. The relative shift is due to the substitution, in Gi , of a bulky phenylalanine residue for Leu282 in the helical 3- 5 loop (Fig. 2). To avoid collision with the conserved Phe215 (Gi ) in switch II, 3- 5 is translated by approximately 1.5 Å. The 3- 5 loop of Gs is also stabilized by a stacking interaction between Trp277 and His357 in the 4- 6 loop. No such stabilizing contacts are possible in Gi because Trp277 and His357 are replaced by Cys264 and Lys317, respectively, and because the 4- 6 loop of Gi differs in sequence, length, and structure from the corresponding loop in Gs . Indeed, substitution of the Gi 4- 6 loop into Gs abolishes activation of adenylyl cyclase (20) by removing stabilizing interactions and perhaps also by disrupting adjacent effector binding regions. However, substitution of the Gs 46 sequence into Gi fails to confer cyclasestimulating activity because the 4- 6 loop supports, but does not form part of, the cyclase binding site. Switch II of Gi and, less convincingly, its 4- 6 loop have been implicated in formation of the inhibitory complex with type V and VI adenylyl cyclases (21) at a site distinct from that rec1945

Table 1. Summary of data collection and refinement statistics. The short-splice form of bovine Gs was expressed with a COOH-terminal hexahistidine tag in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, followed by hydroxyapatite and Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography, essentially as described by Lee et al. (32). Purified Gs was concentrated to 12 mg ml 1 (270 M) and incubated with 800 M GTP S in a buffer containing 20 mM Na Hepes (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DT T). Crystals of Gs were obtained at 20°C by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Hanging drops containing 6 l total of a 1:1 mixture of activated Gs and well solution were suspended over a 500- l well containing 90 to 100% saturated KH2PO4 or 2.5 M NaH2PO4. The crystals, which form as bundles of 20- m thick plates, belong to space group P212121 and contain two molecules of Gs per asymmetric unit. For data collection, individual crystals were harvested in a solution containing 2.5 M NaH2PO4, 25 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5), 5 mM MgSO4, 2 mM DT T, 1 mM EDTA, 150 M GTP S, and 15% glycerol as the cryoprotectant. The crystals were subsequently frozen in liquid propane and were maintained at 180°C during data collection. Diffraction data were collected from two crystals with the use of 0.908 Å radiation from the A1 beam line at the Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The data were integrated and scaled with the HKL package (33), and the structure was solved by molecular replacement with the use of AMORE (34) as implemented by the CCP4 program suite (35). A cross-rotation function using Gi 1 GTP S (7 ) as the search model revealed only one significant peak. Subsequently, two translationally related molecules of Gs GTP S were located by the translation function. These two subunits constitute a noncrystallographic dimer oriented along the a axis of the unit cell. The initial atomic model was built by substituting Gi side chains with their equivalents in Gs using the program O (36), and subsequent manual model building was alternated with conventional and simulated annealing refinement in X-PLOR 3.851 (37, 38). The two molecules of Gs were restrained by their noncrystallographic symmetry only for the first several rounds of refinement. The two subunits superimpose with a rmsd of 0.3 Å. The backbone conformations of 92% of the amino acids are within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot; there are no residues in disallowed regions (39).

ognized by Gs (22) (Fig. 1C). Switch III, which is stabilized by ionic contacts with switch II, does not contribute to the adenylyl cyclase binding site. Located at the NH2-terminus of 3 distal to the 3- 5 loop, switch III adopts the same conformation in Gs and Gi . Accordingly, disruption of an ionic contact between switch III and switch II through mutation of Arg231 only modestly reduces the stimulatory activity of Gs (23). Gs does not undergo a conformational change upon binding to the soluble domains of adenylyl cyclase. The rmsd between the 334 C atom pairs in the free and bound forms of Gs is 0.5 Å. The effector-binding regions of Gs , and perhaps those of other G subunits, are already maintained in a competent conformation in the GTP S-bound form of the protein. In contrast, the switch II elements of both Gt and Gi , and probably Gs , undergo substantial conformational changes when GDP is exchanged for GTP S. Although the apparent affinity of adenylyl cyclase for Gs GDP is only 10 times less than for Gs GTP S (24), Gs GDP binds with much greater affinity to subunits than does Gs GTP S (25). Consequently, full deactivation of adenylyl cyclase requires the rapid sequestration of Gs GDP in a high-affinity complex with . Although the effector binding sites of Gs and Gi (or Gt ) differ, the residues in the extensive binding surfaces observed in Gi 1 (Ile184, Phe199, Lys210, Trp211, Cys214, and Phe215) (15) are largely conserved in Gs . Superposition of the subunits from both the i 1 2 heterotrimer and the Gs adenylyl cyclase complex demonstrates that and adenylyl cyclase bind

to extensively overlapping sites on the subunit (Fig. 3) and are similarly oriented with respect to the plasma membrane. Thus, is a potent competitor with adenylyl cyclase for the GDP-bound form of Gs . Although the 3- 5 and 4- 6 loops have been implicated in effector binding and specificity, they do not participate in interactions with (Fig. 3). In contrast to the mechanism of effector recognition, the selectivity of RGS proteins for Gi subunits (compared to Gs ) can be attributed to differences in the amino acid composition rather than the conformation of the RGS binding site. The crystal structure of RGS4 complexed with Gi 1 GDP AlF4­ demonstrates that RGS proteins activate GTP hydrolysis by binding to and stabilizing all three switch elements of Gi in their transition state conformation (17). All RGS molecules characterized thus far are capable of accelerating the GTPase activities of Gi or Gq subfamily members (or both) but not of Gs (4). Because the backbone conformations of the switch I and II elements are essentially identical in Gi and Gs , the specificity of RGS for heterotrimeric G protein subfamilies is largely dictated by the identity of side chains within the switch elements. Six residues of Gi 1 that come in contact with RGS4 are not conserved in Gs : Lys180 (Leu203 in Gs ), Thr182 (Ser205), and Val185 (Phe208) in switch I; and Ser206 (Asp229), Lys209 (Arg232), and His213 (Gln236) in switch II. These substitutions deter binding of RGS proteins to Gs by steric overlap, charge repulsion, or the creation of small cavities in the interface (for example, the substitution of Thr182 by Ser205). Although each substitution alone does not seem sufficient

to disrupt a potential RGS Gs complex, their cumulative effects apparently are. Surprisingly, the "footprint" of RGS4, as mapped onto the surface of Gs , does not substantially overlap with that of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3). Superposition of Gi 1 RGS4 on Gs adenylyl cyclase reveals only minor potential steric conflicts between adenylyl cyclase and RGS4, although no substantial interface exists between them. Assuming an analogous interaction between switch II of Gi and as-yet-unidentified domains of type V and VI adenylyl cyclase, RGS4 could potentially accelerate GTP hydrolysis while Gi is still bound to adenylyl cyclase. This in turn suggests the possibility that RGS proteins and adenylyl cyclase, perhaps along with heterotrimeric G proteins and their receptors, exist as discrete complexes on the membrane of the cell after activation of G protein­coupled receptors. The fidelity of signal transduction depends on the capacity of G protein­coupled receptors to distinguish among the unique structural features of various G subunits. Although the surface contacted by the receptor probably includes segments of the subunit and the NH2-terminus of G , the COOH-terminus of G contributes importantly to receptor selectivity [reviewed in (26)]. Evidence gained from alanine-scanning mutagenesis (27) and patterns of evolutionary conservation (28) also argue for inclusion of the 4- 6 loop and the 5 helix in the receptor binding surface. The 5 helix of Gs is kinked at its midsection and bends around the underlying sheet

Fig. 2. Superposition of the putative effector binding loops ( 2- 4, 3- 5, and 4- 6) and the 5 helix from Gs onto Gi (42). The side chains from residues of Gs are drawn as stick models with the use of conventional coloring. The backbone and side chains of Gi are illustrated in transparent rose. The model of Gi is derived from the structure of the Gi 1 RGS4 complex (17 ), which has a completely ordered 5 helix. The superposition is essentially the same as that shown in Fig. 1B. The 2- 4 loops of each subunit are essentially identical. The 3- 5 loop of Gs , although structurally similar to that of Gi , is rotated downward in the figure. This rotation creates a hydrophobic pocket on the back side of the sheet, which is filled by the side chain of Met386 from the 5 helix, and moves the residue at position 282 in Gs toward the conserved Phe238. In the Gs subfamily, residue 282 is a leucine, which helps to accommodate the shift of the 3- 5 loop. The 4- 6 loop of Gs is longer than and shares no sequence identity with its counterpart in Gi . The 3- 5 and 4- 6 loops are supported by a stacking interaction between Trp277 and His357, both of which are invariant in the Gs subfamily. The 5 helix of Gs is bent, whereas that of Gi extends straight into solvent. The large differences observed in the 4- 6 and 5 structures may help account for receptor specificity among closely related subunits. 1946 SCIENCE VOL. 278 12 DECEMBER 1997

Fig. 3. Interaction footprints of G regulators and effectors. Surfaces representing contact regions of (blue), RGS4 (red), and adenylyl cyclase (green) are mapped onto the solvent-accessible surface of Gs (43). A contact was defined as an interatomic distance of less than 4.0 Å. Residues that contact both adenylyl cyclase and are colored cyan, those that contact both RGS4 and are magenta, and those that interact with all three are dark gray. RGS4 and adenylyl cyclase have few if any significant steric overlaps; the gray areas thus represent cases where each protein contacts a different part of the same G residue. The figure was generated with GRASP (43).

(Figs. 1A and 2). The 4- 6 loop is in close proximity to the COOH-terminus of 5. The contact is stabilized by insertion of Met386 into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the NH2-terminal residues of 5 and 6. Together, the 4- 6 loop and the 5 helix form a plane on the back side of Gs that may interact with receptors (29­31). In contrast, the corresponding 5 helix in Gi (as visualized in the structures of the Gi 1 GDP 1 2 and Gi 1 GDP AlF4­ RGS4 complexes) is relatively straight and extends away from the central sheet of the Ras-like domain (Fig. 2). The relative position of the 4- 6 loop of Gs also differs from that of the cognate loop of Gi . The divergence of these two structural elements from those of Gi and Gt may therefore contribute to receptor selectivity.

Mediation of Sonic Hedgehog­Induced Expression of COUP-TFII by a Protein Phosphatase
Venkatesh Krishnan, Fred A. Pereira, Yuhong Qiu, Chien-Huan Chen, Philip A. Beachy, Sophia Y. Tsai,* Ming-Jer Tsai*
A Sonic hedgehog (Shh) response element was identified in the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter­transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) promoter that binds to a factor distinct from Gli, a gene known to mediate Shh signaling. Although this binding activity is specifically stimulated by Shh-N (amino-terminal signaling domain), it can also be unmasked with protein phosphatase treatment in the mouse cell line P19, and induction by Shh-N can be blocked by phosphatase inhibitors. Thus, Shh-N signaling may result in dephosphorylation of a target factor that is required for activation of COUP-TFII­, Islet1-, and Gli response element­ dependent gene expression. This finding identifies another step in the Shh-N signaling pathway.

COUP-TFs belong to the orphan receptor
subfamily within the steroid­thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and are found in all vertebrate species examined (1). In the mouse there are two COUP-TF members, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII. Both are expressed in the neural tube during embryonic development; however, COUP-TFII is highly expressed and displays a restricted expression pattern that is coincident with motor neuron differentiation (1). Transplantation of a notochord to the dorsal side of the chick neural tube results in ectopic expression of COUP-TFII that coincides with the appearance of motor neuron markers such as Isl1 and SC-1 in these regions (2).

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene hedgehog (Hh) (3). The secreted Shh protein (Shh-N) from the notochord is required for induction of floor plate cells, motor neurons, and other axial midline structures (4­7). To investigate whether Shh activates COUP-TFII expression, we asked whether purified recombinant Shh-N expressed in Escherichia coli can induce COUP-TFII expression in P19 cells (8). Increased COUP-TFII expression is observed at Shh-N concentrations as low as 0.2 nM (Fig. 1A, lane 2). This concentration is similar to the amount that is required for regulating other Shh-N target genes (3, 9) and for binding to its putative receptor, patched (ptc) (10, 11). To identify the target element or elements for Shh-N signaling, we used deletion analysis and identified a sequence between 1316 and 1298 nucleotides in the COUP-TFII promoter that increases reporter gene activity when linked to a heterologous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) promoter (12) (Fig. 2).
