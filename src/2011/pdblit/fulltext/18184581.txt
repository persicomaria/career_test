ABSTRACT Bachrach, H.L., Morgan, D.O., McKercher, P.D., Moore, D.M. and Robertson, B.H., 1982. Foot-and-mouth disease virus: Immunogenicity and structure of fragments derived from capsid protein VP 3 and of virus containing cleaved VP 3. Vet. Microbiol., 7: 85--96. Peptide fragments were obtained from the immunogenic capsid protein VPs, ca. 24 kilodaltons (kd), of foot-and-mouth disease virus t y p e A12119ab by three procedures: (1) spontaneous proteolysis of in virion VP~ in tissue cultures to produce a 15 kd peptide, designated S fragment; (2) trypsin treatment of purified virus to produce a 16 kd peptide, designated T fragment; and (3) cyanogen bromide cleavage of purified VP 3 to produce a 13 kd fragment. Following isolation and purification by gel electrophoresis, VP 3 and each of the three fragments were immunogenic for livestock. Lyophilization appeared to impair the immunogenicity of VP 3. In addition, viruses containing VP 3 fragments produced either by the spontaneous- or trypsin-induced proteolysis were as immunogenic as virus with its VP 3 intact. Amino acid sequencing of N-terminal regions revealed that the S fragment was homologous with the N-terminus of VP3, whereas the 13 kd fragment possessed a unique N-terminus. Thus, putative c o m m o n immunogenic amino acid sequences would appear to reside within an overlap region of the 15 kd S and 13 kd fragments. Sequencing of cDNA prepared to viral genome RNA provided three kinds of information: it (1) placed the above overlap region in the second and third quarters of VP~; (2) demonstrated that the codons for the C-terminus of VPI and N-terminus of VP 3 are contiguous; and (3) supported earlier evidence that these same codons program a chain reversal where VP~ and VP~ are joined in the precursor polyprotein.

86 by Strohmaier et al. (1978) and Bachrach et al. {1979) owing to its N-terminal threonine (Matheka and Bachrach, 1975; Bachrach, 1977). Also, capsid protein VP3 can be cleaved proteolytically and chemically to immunologically-active fragments. An immunogenic peptide doublet designated VPTab was produced by in virion trypsin treatment of virus types A12119 and O, Brugge (Bachrach et al., 1979). More complete treatment produces only the smaller fragment of the doublet, designated herein as 16 kd T fragment. Cyanogen bromide treatment of purified VP~ also produces immunogenic fragments: a 13 kd peptide from type A~2119 virus (Bachrach et al., 1979) and two peptides, 5.2 and 6.2 kd, from type O, Kaufbeuren (Kaaden et al., 1977). The present work is concerned, in part, with immunogenic studies in livestock of capsid protein VP3 from virus type A12 strain 119 large-plaque variant ab (A12119ab), and of its 13 kd, 16 kd T and 15 kd S peptide fragments. The latter fragment is present in virus purified from bacterially contaminated tissue cultures, and apparently results from in virion proteolysis of VP3 by as yet unidentified proteases. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequences of VP3, and of S and 13 kd fragments indicates that putative common immunogenic amino acid sequence(s) may reside in an overlap region of the two fragments. In addition, it was established that virions with intact VP3 or with VP3, proteolyzed either in tissue cultures or by trypsin treatment, were immunogenic for swine. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus

FMDV type A12119ab distinguishable with IgM but not with IgG antibodies (Cowan, 1969; Martinsen, 1970) was grown in BHK-21 cell rolling-bottle cultures, concentrated with polyethylene glycol (Wagner et al., 1970), and purified by CsC1 density-gradient centrifugation (Bachrach et al., 1964).
VP3 and 15 kd S and 16 kd T fragments

Untreated virus, tissue-culture proteolyzed virus and trypsin-treated virus (virus-TPCK trypsin 200 : 1, w/w incubated for 45--60 min at 37°C) were degraded at 100 ° C for 4 rain in sample preparation buffer (SPB) containing 10% glycerine, 2% SDS, 5%/3-mercaptoethanol, 8 M urea and 0.06 M Tris-HC1 (pH 7.1). Capsid protein VP3 and its S and T fragments were isolated by preparative disc poly-acrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis {PAGE) (Maizel, 1971) on 8-mm-thick 12.5% slab gels containing 8 M urea, Fig. 1 (Bachrach, 1981}. The bands were visualized by chilling (Bachrach, 1981}, sectioned out, and the gel comminuted through a syringe and fine-mesh stainless steel screen. When free VP3 was required, it was electrophoretically eluted from gel sections (Braa~z and McIntyre, 1977) or obtained directly from disrupted virus by chromatography on DEAE A-25 Sephadex {Bernard et al., 1974), dialyzed

The pellet was washed in acetone, dissolved in 50% formic acid, diluted ten-fold in water and lyophilized. Quantitation of VP3 from the formic acid solution was carried out by analytical disc PAGE (Bachrach, 1981). 13 kd fragment Capsid protein VP3 in 70% formic acid was treated for 24 h at 25°C with two 150-fold CNBr molar additions in excess of VP3 methionine residues (Bachrach et al., 1979). The reaction mixture was dried with nitrogen, dissolved in SPB and fractionated by preparative disc PAGE on 8-ram-thick slab gels containing 8 M urea. After electrophoresis, the slabs were chilled, and the opaque band corresponding to the 13 kd fragment was excised and comminuted as above (Bachrach et al., 1979; Bachrach, 1981). Immunizations Virus in 0.05 M potassium phosphate-0.2 N KC1 pH 7.5, VP3 and VP3 fragments in SPB or in comminuted gel sections were emulsified in a modified Freund's incomplete adjuvant (McKercher and Giordano, 1967).

pigs in groups of five were inoculated subcutaneously with 100 pg of VP3 isolated from virus by (i) PAGE followed by gel comminution, (ii) PAGE followed by elution, lyophilization and resuspension in SPB or (iii) chromatography on DEAE A-25 Sephadex. The mass of VP3 per dose was determined by a disc PAGE procedure reported previously (Bachrach, 1981). Tamworth swine in groups of three, and Hereford cattle in groups of two or four, were inoculated with either 10 pg of virus inactivated by 5 mM acetylethylenimine for 48 h at 25°C and emulsified in adjuvant, or with 100 pgl doses of adjuvanted VP3 or VP3 fragments. Guinea pigs (Table I) and swine (Table II) were reinoculated at 28 days with VP3 and its fragments. Revaccinations in cattle

RESULTS

Responses of guinea pigs to VP3 preparations
Neutralizing antibody responses elicited in guinea pigs were determined to three different preparations of capsid protein VP3 (Fig. 1, lane a). Antibody titers (/> 2.41og PDs0) to VP3 in comminuted polyacrylamide gel and to that isolated by DEAE A-25 Sephadex chromatography were substantially higher than the titer (1.4 log PDs0) induced by VP3 eluted from gel and lyophilized (Table I). This indication that lyophilization (without carrier substances) is detrimental to VP3 had been observed in earlier unpublished work, and is supported further by (i) the absence of detectable antibody in swine vaccinated with lyophilized VP3 (Table II, line 4) and (ii) the substantially lower antibody and immune responses of cattle vaccinated with lyophilized VP3 than with VP3 antigen in comminuted polyacrylamide geI (Table III, lines 1--4).

Responses of swine to virus, VP3 and VP~ fragments
The responses of swine vaccinated with virus, VP3 and VP3 fragments (Fig. 1) are shown in Table II. The neutralizing antibody titer (> 3.1log PDs0) and resistance of swine to challenge (3/3) induced by 10 pg of virus with VP3 in1.0

tact are not markedly higher than values elicited by virus with its VP3 cleaved by proteolysis in tissue culture (Table II, line 2: 3.1log PDs0 and 3/3) or by trypsin (Table II, line 3: 2.81og PDs0 and 3/3). By comparison, two 100 pg doses each of purified capsid protein VP3, 16 kd T fragment, 15 kd S fragment (Figs. la, b and c, respectively) and 13 kd fragment (Fig. 2) were also immunogenic in swine (Table II) but, with the exception of the 16 kd S fragment, induction of neutralizing antibody was impaired. For intact VP3, this impairment is probably caused by lyophilization (see also Table I and Table III, lines 3 and 4), whereas the VP3 fragments were in comminuted gel. Responses o f cattle to VP3 and 13 kd fragment Capsid protein VP3 and its 13 kd fragment were also strongly immunogenic in cattle (Table III). Lyophilized VP3 was again less active than VP3 in comminuted gel particles, both in eliciting neutralizing antibody and protecting cattle against challenge (Fig. 3, Table III). No substantial differences were observed in the responses of cattle that were given two or three vaccinations.

N-terminal sequences in VP3, S and 13 kd chains

Although the results reveal some differences in p o t e n c y between VP3, lyophilized VP3 and VP3 fragments, it could be presumed that these chains may all possess c o m m o n putative immunogenic amino acid sequences. To study this possibility, N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses were determined on VP3 and its 15 kd S and 13 kd fragments. The recoveries of PTH amino acids from the chains are shown in Figs. 4a, b,c. The irregular recoveries are probably caused, in part, by characteristic differences in the stabilities of thiazolinone amino acids at the ambient temperature of the sequencer collection chamber prior to conversions to.the more stable PTH derivatives. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of VP3, 15 kd S and 13 kd chains are shown in Table IV. The complete sequence homology between the 24 kd-VP3 and 15 kd-S N-terminal regions clearly denotes the origin of the latter chain. By contrast, the uniqueness of the 13 kd chain N-terminal sequence places it to, the right of the N-terminal sequences determined for VP3 and the 15 kd S fragment. The reason for not identifying the first three residues of the 13 kd fragment is obscure, b u t trace contaminants may have interfered at the 1--2 nM level of sensitivity and required three cycles for their wash out from the sequencer cup. Nevertheless, it appears that putative c o m m o n immunogenic amino acid sequences lie in an overlap region of the 15 kd S and 13 kd chains. Because VP3 of FMDV type A12119 is reported to possess at least t w o methionine residues (Bachrach et al., 1979), establishing the locus of the 13 kd fragment within VP3 required the sequencing of cDNA prepared to the viral RNA genome. This (Kleid et al., 1981) has confirmed the existence of the putative overlap region. It begins at amino acid residue 55 of VP3 (i.e.,

In addition, codons for -S-Q- were f o u n d directly in f r o n t o f those for -T-T-A-T- (i.e., the N-terminus of VP3), which is in accord with the C-terminus o f VP1 being -S-Q (Bachrach et al., 1973). Thus, post-translational endoproteolysis at the prescursor VPI-VP3 junction produces C- and N-termini in VP1 and VP3 respectively, w i t h o u t trimming by exopeptidases (Bachrach, 1977).

DISCUSSION No marked differences were d e t e c t e d by the m e t h o d s used in this study between the immunogenic p o t e n c y o f virus with VP 3 intact and virus with p r o t e o l y t i c cleavage in its VP3 chains; b o t h kinds o f virus vaccines were equally protective for swine. F r o m these and f o r m e r studies (Bachrach et al., 1975, 1979), it appears that in virion VP3 is a considerably m ore p o t e n t antigen than isolated VP3, especially if the latter molecule has been lyophilized in the absence o f a protective carrier substance. While a single vaccine dose of 10 pg o f virus (containing a p p r o x i m a t e l y 1.6 pg of VP3) induces solid immunity, at least two doses of 100 pg of VP 3 are generally required to effect this degree o f immunity. However, with the high p o t e n c y report ed here for VP3 in c o m m i n u t e d gel particles (Tables I--III, Fig. 3), a single-dose quantitative comparison o f virus vs. VP3 and VP3 fragments in gel appears to be w o r t h y o f investigation. The immu n iz at i on o f swine with capsid protein VP3 has been r e p o r t e d earlier (Bachrach et al., 1975); however, the present work appears t o be the first r e p o r t o f the p r o t e c t i o n of cattle by vaccination with VP3 and o f cattle

94 and swine with VP3 fragments. Earlier unsuccessful trials in cattle (data not shown) may have resulted from the use of lyophilized VP3. This conclusion is supported by the reduced p o t e n c y found for lyophilized VP3 in the present study particularly in guinea pigs and cattle (Tables I--III, Fig. 3). We are quite certain that the high activity of VP3 in gel particles compared to an equivalent mass of lyophilized VP3 is not due to any added adjuvantation by gel particles over oil alone, but rather to a large reduction in the effective concentration of lyophilized VP3 caused by its refractiveness to solubilization, even with added urea, detergents and heating. In this regard, the use of a carrier substance that would permit renaturation and solubilization of the lyophilized VP3 could be expected to enhance its efficacy. Some evidence from this laboratory (data n o t shown) indicates that VP3 has more than one immunogenic site. For influenza virus, new strains are reported to have at least one amino acid replacement in each of four sites in the hemagglutinin chain (Wiley et al., 1981). Thus, the low activity on a mass basis of isolated VP3 in gel particles versus in virion VP3 may be caused, in part, by a masking of cooperative immunogenic sites in the isolated VP3 by conformational changes. Similar masking or even excision of cooperative sites may cause the low antibody responses to T and 13 kd fragments even though these peptides were as immunogenic as VP3. The precise relationship between the S and T fragments from in virion VP3 will require sequencing. Although the fragments are immunogenic (Table II), they are clearly different in molecular weight (Fig. 1, lane d). In addition, trypsin treatment of S-fragment virions is without effect (data not shown), indicating that the trypsin-sensitive bonds in VP3 that give rise to T fragments are masked or have been previously cleaved in the in virion S fragment. Also, treatment of virions having intact VP3 with both trypsin and chymotrypsin produces a fragment that co-migrates with the S fragment (data not shown), indicative of a mechanism for S-fragment virion formation in contaminated cell cultures. The prediction from immunogenic and protein sequence analyses for the existence of immunogenic amino acid sequences in an overlap region of the 15 kd S and 13 kd fragments and its location by cDNA sequencing indicates that further work should be focused on fragments from this part of the VP3 molecule or of homologous synthetic peptides. Also, predictive rules (Isogai et al., 1980) indicate that the -S-Q-T-T- sequence at the precursor VP1 -VP3 juncture is indicative of a chain reversal as suggested previously (Bachrach, 1977). ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to express their gratitude for excellent technical assistance: to Thomas Fischer for amino acid sequencing; to James Dean and Karl Axelson for protein and peptide fragment preparation and quantitative analysis; and to Nicholas Shuot for serum neutralization tests.
