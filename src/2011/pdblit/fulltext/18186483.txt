ABSTRACT The X-ray structure of monomeric N-methyltryptophan oxidase from Escherichia coli (MTOX) has ° been solved at 3.2 A resolution by molecular replacement methods using Bacillus sp. sarcosine oxidase structure (MSOX, 43% sequence identity) as search model. The analysis of the substrate binding site highlights the structural determinants that favour the accommodation of the bulky N-methyltryptophan residue in MTOX. In fact, although the nature and geometry of the catalytic residues within the first contact shell of the FAD moiety appear to be virtually superposable in MTOX and MSOX, the presence of a Thr residue in position 239 in MTOX (Met245 in MSOX) located at the entrance of the active site appears to play a key role for the recognition of the amino acid substrate side chain. Accordingly, a 15 fold increase in kcat and 100 fold decrease in Km for sarcosine as substrate has been achieved in MTOX upon T239M mutation, with a concomitant three-fold decrease in activity towards N-methyltryptophan. These data provide clear evidence for the presence of a catalytic core, common to the members of the methylaminoacid oxidase subfamily, and of a side chain recognition pocket, located at the entrance of the active site, that can be adjusted to host diverse aminoacids in the different enzyme species. The site involved in the covalent attachment of flavin has also been addressed by screening degenerate mutants in the relevant positions around Cys308-FAD linkage. Lys341 appears to be the key residue involved in flavin incorporation and covalent linkage.

INTRODUCTION N-methyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) is a member of a recently characterized protein family involved in the oxidation of aminoacids. The family includes monomeric sarcosine oxidase (MSOX), pipecolate oxidase (PIPOX), heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase (TSOX), D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) and possibly two mitochondrial enzymes, sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH) and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH)1­5 (Fig. 1). MTOX (42 kDa) and MSOX (44 kDa) are the closest homologues in this family, exhibiting 43% sequence identity. MTOX is $30% identical with PIPOX, while 24% sequence identity with the b subunit of TSOX, with the N-terminal half of rat liver DMGDH and with human SDH can be observed. The members of the MTOX family have different biochemical and physiological functions. In the brain, PIPOX participates in the lysine degradation pathway where it oxidizes L-pipecolate, a neuromodulator of the GABA receptor complex.6 Peroxisomal DAAO degrades Dserine, a modulator of neurotransmission in the brain. DMGDH and SDH are flavoproteins which catalyze the oxidative demethylation of dimethyl glycine to sarcosine and sarcosine to glycine, respectively.7,8 The gene encoding MTOX (solA) was identified on the basis of its high sequence homology with MSOX.9 Both enzymes catalyze the oxidative demethylation of N-methyl amino acids using oxygen as electron acceptor. N-methyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of various N-methyl amino acids, yielding the corresponding unsubstituted amino acid, formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme has a preference for methylamino

acids with aromatic or large aliphatic side chains, Nmethyltryptophan being the preferred substrate. In turn, sarcosine (N-methylglycine), the simplest N-methyl amino acid, is a poor substrate for MTOX.10,11 MTOX is expressed as a constitutive enzyme in a wild-type E. coli K-12 strain.12 Expression is increased by growth on minimal media but is not induced by N-methyltryptophan, unlike MSOX expression which is induced by sarcosine, a common soil metabolite that can represent an

important source of carbon and energy for various bacteria.13 Thus, the metabolic role of N-methyl amino acids other than sarcosine is currently unexplained although N-methyltryptophan has been identified in certain plant species and N-methyl amino acids are found in polyketide antibiotics.14,15 The mechanism of sarcosine oxidation to glycine and formaldehyde catalyzed by MTOX and MSOX has been thoroughly studied through pH and kinetic isotope effects and led to the conclusion that

probably a hydride transfer occurs between the methylamino moiety and the active N5 atom of flavin.11,16 Structural studies on MSOX demonstrated that catalysis is assisted by a cluster of residues within the first contact shell of the isoalloxazine ring that is highly conserved in MTOX. Thus, the reasons for the different substrate specificity between MSOX and MTOX are as yet unexplained. In the present article, the crystal structure of MTOX from E. coli has been determined with a resolution of ° 3.2 A. On its basis, a site-directed mutagenesis study in the active site was carried out, and the properties of the mutants obtained were analyzed to study the structural determinants of substrate specificity.

EXPERIMENTAL
Cloning of wt MTOX and of its mutants

The gene of methyl tryptophan oxidase from E. coli was amplified using the following oligonucleotides: MTOXNterm 50 -GCAGAGAGAAAACCATGGAATACGAT CTC-30 , MTOXCterm 50 -GCAACGCCGAAGCTTTAAATA CTCC-30 , cloned between the NcoI and HindIII unique sites of the pET28b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the oligonucleotides reported in Supplemental Material. The mutants R51S, T239M, T239MQ247I, H338T, H338N, K341Q, K341R, and K341L were obtained and sequenced.

phy system. The HA column was equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The purified proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of sodium phosphate at pH 7.5 (5­500 mM), dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 and concentrated with an Amicon YM-10 membrane. Wild type and mutant MTOX are highly expressed under the experimental conditions tested. Wild type and mutant MTOX represented about 30% of total protein content of the E. coli pellet. The enzyme is highly soluble and the ion exchange and affinity chromatography procedures are effective in removing contaminating proteins, yielding about 15 mg of purified enzyme per liter of culture. The purified proteins gave a single band on native-PAGE which coincided with the yellow-colored fraction and with enzyme activity. All the mutants tested are expressed at levels comparable to those of wild type MTOX expression. The protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient for the oxidized enzyme of 13300 M21 cm21 at 457 nm and pH 8.0.17

Enzymes activity and incorporation of FAD

Wild type MTOX and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as follows: cells were grown in 1 L of Luria-Bertani medium containing 30 lg/mL kanamycin at 308C to an A600 of 0.8. The proteins were expressed for 6 h at 258C, upon induction with 2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000g for 10 min at 48C). Cell pellets were frozen overnight, then resuspended and sonicated in 10 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The extracts were then centrifuged at 16,000g for 20 min at 48C. The resultant supernatants were then applied to a DEAE-sepharose column (2.6 3 12 cm2) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM PMSF. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the recombinant proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0.0 to 0.5 M. The peaks containing MTOX or its mutants were subsequently dialyzed against 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite HA 1000 column connected with a fast protein liquid chromatogra-

The rate of substrate consumption was determined at 258C by monitoring hydrogen peroxide formation using a horseradish peroxidase coupled assay.10 Reactions were performed in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA, substrate, 320 lM o-dianisidine, and 2.4 U horseradish peroxidase in a total volume of 200 lL. Assays were initiated by addition of MTOX, and formation of oxidized o-dianisidine was followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 460 nm (e460 5 6765 M21 cm21). Time courses were followed within 2­5 min time frame. Least squares data fitting were carried out with the Matlab program [The Math Works, South Natick, MA] according to the simple steady state approximation detailed in Ref. 10. The extent of FAD incorporation was measured by calculating the ratio between the absorption peaks at 460 and 280 nm.

Protein crystallization

Crystallization was achieved at 293 K by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. A 2 lL volume of the protein sample, equilibrated against 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 12 mg/mL, was mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution containing 0.1 M sodium acetate at pH values between 5.4 and 5.6, PEG 4000 in a range between 18 and 22% w/v and isopropanol in a range between 18 and 22% v/v. Crystals grew in more than 2 weeks to about 0.05 3 0.1 3 0.2 mm3.

Structure solution and refinement

The structure was solved by molecular replacement using as search probe a polyalanine-truncated model built from the Bacillus sp. B-0618 MSOX (Monomeric Sarcosine OXidase) monomer (Protein Data Bank entry 1EL5). The rotational and translational searches, performed with the program MOLREP19 in the resolution ° range of 10­3.2 A, produced a clear solution. Refinement of the atomic coordinates and displacement parameters was carried out applying the NCS restraints to the four subunits of MTOX from residue 2 to residue 370. Refinement was performed using the program REFMAC520 which applies the maximum likelihood method. The refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Model building was performed using the program COOT.21 The final model (consisting of four monomers) includes 1479 residues (2­372 residues in monomer A, 1­372 in monomer B, 2­370 in monomer C, 2­371 in monomer D), 4 FAD molecules, 4 sodium ions. The final Rcrys for ° all resolution shells (50­3.2 A) calculated using the working set reflections (21,754) is 23.6%, and the Free R value calculated using the test set reflections (1464) is 31%. The final Rcrys calculated for the highest resolution shell ° (3.3­3.2 A) using the working set reflections (1494) is 26.7% and the Free R value calculated using the test set reflections (64) is 32%. The quality of the model was assessed by the program PROCHECK.22 The most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot contain 82.7% of nonglycine residues. The atomic coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 2UZZ). A model of MTOX binding site containing N-methyltryptophan was obtained by superposing the coordinates of the active sites of MTOX and MSOX containing dimethyl glycine. The coordinates for N-methyltryptophan were then generated by superposing the positions of the alpha carbon, of the carboxyl and amino groups to those of dimethyl glycine.

RESULTS
Structure determination

The crystal structure of MTOX from E. coli was solved ° at 3.2 A by molecular replacement using as search model the crystal structure of MSOX from Bacillus sp. B-0618 (PDB code 1EL5). Many attempts have been made to obtain better diffracting crystals, but all measured crystals ° did not diffract better than 3.2 A with a reasonable I/r(I). The self rotation function has been used to determine the number of molecules per asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit contains four identical monomers. The structure has been refined using the four-fold NCSconstraints.

Overall fold

MTOX is a flavoenzyme formed by two different domains [Fig. 2(A,B)]: a classical FAD binding domain (F, azure) formed by the N-terminal region (residues 1­ 50), a central region (residues 144­209) and the C-terminal region (residues 315­371), and a catalytic domain (C, red) formed by two different regions (residues 51­143 and 210­314, respectively). The FAD binding domain has a fold common to PHBH (p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase), MSOX and also

to glutathione reductase (GR).1,24 As shown in Figure 2(B), the general architecture of this domain is almost conserved with respect to MSOX.1 Thus, the FAD binding domain is organized in three levels: on the top a three stranded antiparallel b-sheet bF4-bF6, in the middle a five-stranded parallel b-sheet (bF1, bF2, bF3, bF7, bF9) flanked by an additional b-strand (bF8) and on the bottom four a-helices, aF1 (residues 12­24), aF2 (residues 148­161), aF3 (residues 204­207) and aF4 (residues 340­356) and a small antiparallel b-sheet (residues 47­49 and 144­148). This small sheet is present as an additional feature of the FAD domain with respect to the MSOX topology and is adjacent to the catalytic domain and positioned close to the FAD isoalloxazine ring. As in MSOX, the FAD-binding domain is interrupted twice by the insertion of the other domain indicated as ``catalytic'', whose topology is basically conserved in MTOX. The MSOX catalytic domain is formed by a eight-stranded and mostly anti-parallel b-sheet surrounded by four a-helices. In MTOX these structural features are conserved. However there are some differences with respect to MSOX topology; the bC8 b-strand carrying the FAD-binding C308 is broken in two smaller segments; and an additional short aC4a a-helix 272­275 is positioned before the long aC4b.

The catalytic domain is composed by two parts. One part, interrupting the flavin-binding motif immediately after the strand bF2, comprises an a-helix (aC1, residues 58­76) and a small three anti-parallel b strands (bC1­ bC3) interspersed with two a-helices (aC2, residues 99­ 109; aC3, residues 119­125). The other part interrupts the FAD-binding motif between strands bF7 and an ahelix (residues 340­356) at the C-terminus, and comprises five antiparallel b strands (bC4­bC8) and two ahelices: a one turn helix (residues 272­275, aC4a) and a long a-helix (aC4b, residues 284­295).

Substrate binding site

A superposition of substrate binding sites of MSOX containing dimethyl glycine and MTOX is shown in Figure 3(A). The architecture of the MSOX substrate binding site is conserved in MTOX. In particular, the residues involved in the interaction with the substrate and the residues involved in the catalytic mechanism of the amino acid oxidative demethylation are conserved. Thus Lys341 (Lys348 in MSOX) and Arg51 (Arg52 in MSOX) which interact with the N-methyl amino acid carboxylate in MSOX are conserved, as well as His263 (His269 in

MSOX) which has been shown to be involved as proton exchanger in sarcosine oxidation.11 The only difference between the two sites concerns the residues lining the entrance of the channel which leads from the substrate cavity outside the protein [Fig. 3(A)]. In particular, in MTOX a threonine residue (Thr239) substitutes a methionine residue (Met245), Gln247 substitutes Ile252 and Phe220 substitutes Val225. As shown in Figure 3(B), N-methyltryptophan fits well the MTOX substrate binding site. In our model, the indole ring appears to be stabilized by a hydrogen bond with Gln247, by a p-cation interaction with Arg51 and by a stacking interaction with His269.
FAD binding site

The covalent attachment of flavins to mammalian succinate dehydrogenase has been recognized more than 50 years ago.25,26 Since then, many covalent flavoproteins have been identified. They can be divided in two categories: those in which the flavin is attached to the protein at the 8a-methyl group and those where linkage takes place at the C6 atom of the flavin isoalloxazine ring. The former category can be subdivided depending on the identity of the amino acid side chain linked to the flavin. Whereas Tyr, His, and Cys are able to link to the 8amethyl of FMN or FAD, linkage to the C6 position of the flavin is restricted to Cys and FMN. MTOX contains one molecule of FAD attached to the protein via a thioether linkage between the 8a-methyl group of the isoalloxazine ring and the sulfur of Cys308

[8a-(S-cysteinyl)FAD]. The electron density map at the FAD binding site is well defined [Fig. 4(A)] allowing a detailed comparison with the FAD binding site of the DAAO and PHBH class of flavoenzymes. FAD is in an extended conformation with its ADP moiety bound to the flavin domain. The isoalloxazine ring of FAD is located at the bottom of a cleft between the flavin binding domain and the catalytic domain. FAD is bound to MTOX in a manner similar to that of MSOX and of the other members of the PHBH class of flavoenzymes, in particular DAAO. As for the other family members, a series of hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions are established between the protein and FAD, in addition to the covalent linkage, as indicated in Figure 4. These interactions include one covalent bond, hydrogen bonds, and two helix dipoles. One of the helix dipoles, at the N terminus of aF4, points toward the N(1)­O(2) portion of the flavin ring; the other dipole, at the N terminus of aF1, points toward the pyrophosphate group of FAD. Both these helix dipole interactions are found in all members of the PHBH and GR classes of FAD-binding proteins, which share the same FAD dinucleotide-binding motif. The aF1 helix may serve to partially neutralize the double-negative charge on the pyrophosphate group and the aF4 helix helps to stabilize the electrophilic character of the flavin ring and the anionic forms of the hydroquinone and semiquinone. The environment of FAD in MTOX is more similar to that of MSOX than to that of DAAO. Thus, the FAD binding domain shows a basic character since flavin O(2)

Arg48 is located below the flavin ring (on the si face) and may establish also van der Waals contact with the nitrogen atoms N1, N2, and N10 of the flavin ring, possibly modulating the FAD redox potential (the distance between Arg NE and the N atoms cited above varies ° between 3.7 and 4.6 A) [see Fig. 4(B)]. There are no acidic residues in the region surrounding the isoalloxazine ring, a region dominated by the neutral or basic side chains of His263, Lys341, Arg48, and Arg51. The highly basic nature of the environment of the flavin ring is unusual for the flavoproteins and may increase the redox potential of the flavin ring in MTOX and

The active site of MTOX has been compared with those of DAAO and L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO), in order to single out analogies and differences among the architecture of the active sites. LAAO and DAAO catalyze the oxidative deamination of the L- and D-amino acids respectively, whereas MTOX catalyzes the oxidation of secondary and tertiary amino acids with L stereochemistry. DAAOs are enzymes belonging to the same family of MTOX.28,29 We compared the MTOX structure to the human DAAO structure solved in complex with benzoic acid.4 As shown in Figure 5, although the two proteins display a low degree of homology (ca. $13% sequence identity), they share a similar overall fold and the active site of the two proteins displays some common structural features [Fig. 5(B)]. In particular, some residues are conserved in the active sites of the two enzymes: a leucine residue, involved in substrate stabilization (Leu51 in DAAO, Leu49 in MTOX), a Tyr residue which modulates substrate binding (Tyr228 in DAAO and Tyr249 in MTOX) and an H1 exchanger (Tyr224 in DAAO and His263 in MTOX). Interestingly, the arginine residues (Arg283, engaged in a salt bridge with the carboxylate of the benzoic acid in DAAO, and Arg51 in MTOX), which are involved in substrate binding, are located on the two opposite faces of the cavity in MTOX and DAAO. The active site of MTOX was also compared with the active site of LAAO, which belongs to a different protein family (pdb code 2IID).30 Even though the two proteins do not show a common fold, the active sites display some common features. In fact, in the two proteins three residues important for protein catalysis are conserved, namely an arginine residue (Arg51 in MTOX and Arg90 in LAAO) important for substrate positioning, a histidine residue involved in protein catalysis as proton exchanger (His263 in MTOX and His223 in LAAO) and a tyrosine residue (Tyr249 in MTOX and Tyr372 in DAAO) that probably contributes to substrate specificity. The three amino acids are located at the vertices of two ideal triangles that appear rotated about 1208 one with respect to the other in the two proteins (Fig. 6).
Steady state kinetics of active site mutants with respect to N-methyltryptophan and sarcosine oxidation

cient plasticity and tolerates several substitutions with moderate effects on the steady state kinetic parameters. A notable exception is Lys341 which appears to be a key residue for both FAD incorporation and substrate recognition. Structural analysis of MTOX and MSOX [see Fig. 3(A)] shows that the main differences between the active sites of the two enzymes concern two residues of the second shell lining the entrance of the cavity, namely Thr239 and Gln247 in MTOX instead of Met245 and Ile252 in MSOX. To assess the relevance of these residues

in substrate binding properties, the active site of MTOX has been modified to reproduce the structural features typical of MSOX. Thus, the single mutant T239M and the double mutant T239M-Q247I have been cloned and expressed. Steady state kinetics measurements were carried out in 0.2 M phosphate buffer containing 1 mM EDTA at 258C in aerated buffer by the o-dianisidine peroxidase coupled test (see materials and methods). As shown in Table III, both T239M and T239M-Q247I MTOX mutants show a significant decrease in N-methyltryptophan oxidase activity and a large decrease in the Km value for the sarcosine substrate with respect to the wt protein (in T239M-MTOX, the Km value is about 100-fold lower than in wt MTOX and in T239M-Q247IMTOX it is about 50 times lower than in the wt protein). In particular, in the two mutants the apparent Km values are even lower than that measured in genuine sarcosine

oxidase enzyme.31 The mutations increased the kcat values for sarcosine oxidase for the single and double mutants (380 min21 and 320 min21, respectively) by about 20 fold with respect to the wt protein. In turn, these values are about seven times lower than that reported for B. subtilis MSOX. Mutations in the active site of MTOX were also carried out to analyze the role of residues Arg51, His338 and Lys341 (Table II). Mutation of Arg51 with a serine does not yield differences in FAD incorporation with respect to the wild type enzyme, but it lowers the reactivity of MTOX by about 15%. Substitutions of His338 and, above all, of Lys341, have an effect dependent on the type of mutation. The mutation H338T has no effect on FAD incorporation while the H338N variant shows a small reduction in the incorporation of FAD and in N-methyltryptophan oxidation. The most important effects can be observed in the Lys341 mutants. Mutations K341Q and K341R determine a dramatic decrease in cofactor incorporation, with a 250-fold decrease in kcat for N-methyltryptophan (4.4 min21 for K341Q and 5.0 for min21 K341R). The mutation K341L almost abolishes the incorporation of FAD and impairs enzymatic catalytic ability.

DISCUSSION The resolution of the crystal structure of MTOX brings out analogies and differences with respect to the highly similar MSOX, and highlights the previously unsuspected role of the Thr239 residue in determining the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Comparison of the MTOX and MSOX structures (Fig. 3) provides a clear picture of the common architecture of the active site, in which a set of conserved amino acid side chains (namely Arg51, Tyr54, His263, and Lys341) appear to contribute to the catalytic core of the enzyme. These residues are common to all members of the methylaminoacid oxidase subfamily and are involved in the stereoselective recognition of the carboxyl group of the aminoacid substrate and guide the correct positioning of the methylamino moiety in front

of the flavin N5 atom for oxidative cleavage.1,4,30,32 In addition, a couple of non conserved residues (namely Thr239 and Gln247 in MTOX), located at the entrance of the active site, contribute to the formation of the rear wall of the substrate binding site suggesting that they are involved in the formation of an amino acid side chain recognition pocket. To verify the functional effects of the specific contribution of the Thr239 and Gln247 residues to the substrate recognition, T239M and T239M-Q247I MTOX mutants were prepared. These substitutions were designed in order to build the same structural environment of the active site of MSOX and were expected to decrease dramatically the high affinity of MTOX for N-methyltryptophan and eventually impair substrate turnover. The results shown in Table III indicate clearly that the residue in position 239 is indeed the major structural determinant that governs substrate specificity in MTOX. The 15fold increase in sarcosine oxidation rate with respect to wt MTOX makes T239M-MTOX an efficient sarcosine oxidase enzyme (kcat 5 380 min21), although not as active as its homologue MSOX (kcat 5 2730 min21).31 The kcat/Km ratio for sarcosine oxidation increases from a value of 0.36 mM/min in wt MTOX to 864 mM/min in T239M-MTOX; therefore the mutation determines a huge (ca. 2000 times) increase in substrate specificity. From the mechanistic point of view, it appears that the presence of the methionine side chain in position 239 simply impairs the accommodation of the indole moiety of N-methyltryptophan. However, the favored interaction with sarcosine substrate in T239M-MTOX implies a less trivial explanation. In fact, it can be envisaged that in wt MTOX sarcosine is a slow substrate due to a short residence time and a fast release from the active site. The presence of the methionine side chain in position 239 would dramatically slow down the rate of sarcosine release thus favouring the reactive encounter with the catalitically competent N5 nitrogen of the isoalloxazine ring. This hypothesis is consistent with the findings of Ralph et al.,16 showing that the reductive half reaction of the sarcosine methyl CÀ bond is the rate limiting step ÀH for sarcosine oxidation under steady state conditions, and that CÀ bond cleavage occurs during the first irÀH reversible step in catalysis. A concerted hydride transfer is the simplest proposed mechanism for flavin-dependent amine oxidation and is consistent with the lack of visible intermediate flavin species during sarcosine oxidation, as it requires no intermediates.11,16 Thus, the presence of the Met side chain in position 239 would increase the residence time of the sarcosine substrate within the active site and possibly increase the reductive half reaction rate. The current data also bring out further insight into the structural properties at the basis of the flavin covalent binding to the protein moiety. Recent studies on monomeric MSOX have shown that the mutation of the covalent flavin attachment site (C308A) produces a catalytiPROTEINS

cally inactive apoprotein that forms an unstable complex with FAD (Kd 5 100 lM), similar to that observed with apo wild type MSOX. Thus, autoflavinylation was shown to be a reaction proceeding via a reduced flavin intermediate and requiring only apoMSOX and FAD.33,34 In MSOX, formation of a covalent linkage is necessary in order to prevent loss of the weakly bound oxidized flavin. On this basis, covalent flavin attachment in MSOX is probably obtained in a reaction that requires ionization of the 8a-methyl group in the oxidized flavin and is favored by the highly electropositive active site environment where a number of basic, but no acidic, residues are found near the flavin ring.33,34 Inspection of the crystal structure shows that the flavin O(2) in MTOX is hydrogen bonded to the side-chain of Lys341, and is at a close distance from His338 above the isoallossazine ring, on the re face. Thus, the interactions established between this oxygen and the residues cited above are suggested to be important for the FAD incorporation process. Mutational studies on these residues demonstrate that loosening of such interactions determines partial loss of the coenzyme. In particular, the presence of the basic residue Lys341 is crucial in order to allow covalent linking of the FAD molecule and to prevent flavin loss. As demonstrated in Table II, mutants in this position lower the positive charge content of the region and determine a decrease in the forces that maintain FAD into MTOX. Lys341 is also crucial for binding of the carboxyl moiety of the substrate, as shown by the structure of MSOX-inhibitor complex in which the carboxyl groups of the inhibitor molecules are linked to the two positively charged residues (Arg52 and Lys348) and an ordered water molecule is located in the active site, hydrogen bonded by the N5 of the flavin and a lysine residue. Although only the crystal structure of substrate free MTOX has been solved in the present study, modelling of N-methyltryptophan into MTOX indicates clearly that the carboxyl groups of the substrate can be bound by the same two positively charged residues (Arg51 and Lys341), thus suggesting that the structural determinants for both FAD binding and substrate carboxyl group binding may coincide. The resolution of the crystal structure of MTOX as a complex with substrate analogues is currently under investigation.
