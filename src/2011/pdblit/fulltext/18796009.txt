SKD1/VPS4B belongs to the adenosine triphosphatases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA) family and regulates multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. SKD1 changes its oligomeric state during the ATPase cycle and subsequently releases endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes from endosomes during the formation of MVBs. In this study, we describe domain motions in monomeric SKD1 on ATP and ADP binding. Nucleotides bind between the a/b and the a-helical domains of SKD1, inducing a $208 domain rotation and closure of the binding site, which are similar to the changes observed in the AAA1 ATPase, HslU. Gel filtration and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments showed that the ATP-bound form of SKD1 oligomerizes in solution, whereas ADP-bound and apo forms of SKD1 exist as monomers, even though the conformations of the ADP- and ATP-bound forms are nearly identical. Nucleotide-bound SKD1 structures are compatible with a hexameric ring arrangement reminiscent of the AAA ATPase p97 D1 ring. In the hexameric ring model of SKD1, Arg290 from a neighboring molecule binds to the g-phosphate of ATP, which promotes oligomerization of the ATP-bound form. ATP hydrolysis would eliminate this interaction and subsequent nucleotide release causes the domains to rotate, which together lead to the disassembly of the SKD1 oligomer.

In late endosomal trafficking, endocytosed membrane proteins are sorted into internal vesicles of the endosome known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). MVB sorting is mediated by a set of class E vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) proteins (1­3). Most of the class E Vps proteins are components of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes, which recognize cargo proteins and recruit them into MVBs. The MVB sorting machinery is also used during retrovirus budding, which is a topologically similar process to MVB sorting (4). The class E protein Vps4 belongs to the adenosine triphosphatases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA) family, which is a subfamily of the AAAþ superfamily. AAAþ ATPases show a broad range of biological functions, such as assembly or disassembly of protein complexes, protein transport and protein degradation (5). Yeast Vps4p disassembles and releases components of ESCRT from endosomal membranes using the energy acquired during ATP hydrolysis (6), which allows multiple cycles of MVB sorting. Two mammalian homologues of Vps4p, suppressor of K+ transport growth defect (SKD1) / VPS4B and VPS4A, are also involved in MVB biogenesis. Overexpression of a mammalian ATPase-deficient Vps4 mutant protein dramatically affects endosomal morphology and results in the accumulation of internalized receptors on large aberrant endosomal compartments (7,8). For ATP hydrolysis, AAAþ family ATPases are generally required to form oligomers (5). The apo and ADP-bound forms of yeast Vps4p have been demonstrated to form dimers, whereas the ATP-bound form of the protein assembles into 10­12mers (6,9). ATP-dependent oligomerization was also observed in human VPS4B (9). Although the reported crystal structure of the apo form of human VPS4B was monomeric, structural similarity to the hexameric AAA ATPase p97 D1 cassette supports the hexameric ring formation of human VPS4B in solution (9). The structural basis of the nucleotide-dependent assembly and disassembly of Vps4, however, is still unknown. In this study, we report the crystal structures of the apo, ATP-bound and ADP-bound forms of mouse SKD1/VPS4B and describe the oligomerization mechanism of SKD1/VPS4B based on the nucleotide-dependent conformational changes.

Crystal Structures of AAA ATPase SKD1/VPS4B

crystal structure of the apo form of SKD1 is composed of an AAA domain (this domain can be further divided into an a/b domain and an a-helical domain), a b domain inserted within the AAA a-helical domain and a C-terminal a-helix (helix a10) (Figure 1). This structure is similar to the previously reported structure of the apo form of human VPS4B, which shows 96% amino acid sequence identity with mouse SKD1 (9). The N-terminal region (residues 1­ 122) including the microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain is disordered and invisible in the mouse SKD1 crystal, also disordered are the b2/a3 loop (residues 207­211) and the b3/a4 loop (residues 239­247); these regions were also invisible in the human VPS4B crystal (9). The N-terminal b-strand structure (b0 ) of human VPS4B (9) was not observed in mouse SKD1. The overall structures of the apo forms of mouse SKD1 and human VPS4B can be superimposed and only show deviations at the b6 and b7 strands and the b6­b7 loop of the b domain (Figure 1), ° with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.17 A for the Ca atoms excluding these residues (residues 361­383). Because our attempts to crystallize SKD1 in the presence of ATP or ADP failed, we soaked the apo form crystals in solutions of ATP or ADP. The ATP- and ADP-soaked crystal ° structures were determined to 3.0 and 3.2 A resolutions, respectively (Figure 1). The omit Fo À Fc electron density maps revealed that each nucleotide bound between the a/b and the a-helical domains (Figure S1). The overall structure of the ADP-bound form is similar to that of the ° ATP-bound form with a 0.73 A r.m.s.d. for all of the Ca atoms (Figure 1). Compared with the structure of the apo form, nucleotide binding caused a large relative rotation

between the a/b domain (residues 123­300 and 425­444) and the a-helical domain including the inserted b domain (residues 301­424) (Figure 1). Compared with the apo form, domain rotations analyzed using the DYNDOM program (10) were 19.38 in the ATP-bound form and 20.28 in the ADP-bound form. Similar motion has been also observed in the domains of the AAAþ ATPase HslU (see Discussion). Nucleotide binding also caused minor conformational changes within the a/b domain, which showed ° a relatively high r.m.s.d. of 1.8 A for the Ca atoms of the a/b domain, mainly because of a shift of the a1 and a2 helices toward the nucleotide-binding site. Additionally, in the presence of nucleotides, the b3/a4 loop, which had been invisible in the structure of the apo form, became structured in the crystal even though this loop is distant from the nucleotide-binding site. The a/b and a-helical domains of mouse SKD1 have high sequence identity (33%) with those of the D1 cassette of the mouse AAA ATPase p97. Superimposing the Ca atoms of SKD1 onto those of the hexameric ring structure of the ADP-bound form of p97 D1 (PDB ID: 1S3S) demonstrated that the nucleotide-bound forms of SKD1 could assemble into a hexameric ring model without any major steric clashes. Except for the loop regions as well as the b domain and a10 helix, both of which are not present in p97 (Figure 2) (9,11), the average r.m.s.d. ° values of the overall Ca superimposition were 1.75 A for 214 residues of the ATP-bound form of SKD1 and ° 1.65 A for 212 residues of the ADP-bound form of SKD1 when the superposition was performed using secondarystructure matching in the LSQKAB program (12). However, the apo structure of SKD1 deviates from the p97 D1 ° structure, showing an average r.m.s.d. of 2.36 A for 206 residues. The docking program ROSETTADOCK was used to remodel the side chains of the hexameric ring without moving the backbone and score the interface between the protomers (13,14). The interfaces between protomers in the hexameric ring model produced an average score of À240 for the ATP-bound form of SKD1 and À150 for the ADP-bound form of SKD1 (lower scores are better), whereas the apo form of SKD1 resulted in an average score of þ180 because of apparent steric clashes between the a1 helix and the a8 helix from the neighboring molecule (Figure 2). This incompatibility may explain why the apo form of SKD1 predominantly exists as a monomer in solution (see below). In the hexameric ring model, nucleotides are located at the interfaces between protomers, suggesting that ATP binding leads to the assembly of SKD1 into the hexameric ring structure (see below). The nucleotide-binding modes of SKD1 The nucleotide-binding site is formed at the interface between the a/b and the a-helical domains (Figure 3). The bound nucleotides assume an anti conformation as is observed in the crystal structures of the p97 D1 and NSF D2 domains (15­17). In the structure of the ATP-bound 2181

form of SKD1 (Figure 3), the adenine base of ATP is stacked between Tyr182 (a2 helix of the a/b domain, adjacent to the Walker A motif) and Met309 (a6 of the a-helical domain) and is also surrounded by Val136 and Ala137 (N-terminal loop of the a/b domain). The ribose is bound to Tyr182 (a2 of the a/b domain) and His313 (a6 of the a-helical domain) as well as Gly338 and Ser342 (a8 of the a-helical domain). The Gly177, Gly179, Lys180 and Ser181 residues from the Walker A motif (174GPPGTGKS181) in the P-loop connecting b1 and the a2 helix co-ordinate the phosphates. The sensor residue Asn279 (next to the C-terminal end of b4) also interacts with the g-phosphate. The Walker B motif (234DEID237) in b3 is located near the phosphate groups of ATP. We could observe electron density surrounded by the b- and g-phosphates of ATP and the side chain of Ser181 in the P-loop, which could be a putative Mg2þ ion. However, its density is merged with the density of neighboring atoms because of low resolution of the data. These interactions between SKD1 and the ATP molecule are similar to those of p97 D1 with ADP (Figure 4). The Mg2þ ion, however, is not bound to ADP in the structure of p97 D1 (15). However, in the structure of NSF D2, a Mg2þ ion is co-ordinated by the side chain of the Thr residue from the Walker A motif, the b- and gphosphates of ATP and water molecules (16,17). Two Asp residues in the Walker B motif indirectly interact with Mg2þ by two of the three Mg2þ-co-ordinating water molecules in NSF D2. Because of the low resolution of the ATP-bound SKD1 structure, we were not able to 2182

observe the water molecules, although the distances between the putative Mg2þ ion and the carboxyl oxygen atoms of these residues are small enough (ranging between ° 3.1 and 4.2 A) to allow water-mediated hydrogen bonding. The ADP-binding mode of SKD1 is almost the same as the ATP-binding mode except for the g-phosphate and the putative Mg2þ ion, which are absent in the structure of the ADP-bound form of SKD1. The g-phosphate sensor Asn279 does not bind to any of the phosphate atoms of ADP. Nucleotide binding causes significant motion among the residues sandwiching the adenine base of ATP (Figure 3). Domain rotation between the a/b and the a-helical domains brings Met309, His313, Gly338 and Ser342 of the a-helical domain closer to the adenine, suggesting that the domain rotation is mainly caused by a packing interaction between these residues and the adenine base. Furthermore, in the a/b domain, the a2 helix shifts and the side ° chain of Tyr182 moves about 2.5 A from its position in the structure of the apo form of SKD1 to pack against the adenine base of the ATP molecule. The side chain of Glu235 moves toward the putative Mg2þ ion in the ATPbound form and points away from the nucleotide-binding site in the structures of the ADP-bound and apo forms. Conserved arginine residues implicated in ATP hydrolysis As reported by Scott et al., among the known structures of the AAA ATPases, the human VPS4B monomer structure (and hence mouse SKD1 as well) allows the best Traffic 2008; 9: 2180­2189

superimposition on the ADP-bound form of the p97 D1 hexameric ring (9). In the hexameric ring of the ADP-bound form of p97 D1, two arginine residues (positions 1 and 2) (18) in the loop after the a5 helix are brought close to the phosphate groups. Unlike other AAA ATPases, mammalian Vps4 lacks the Pro/Phe-Gly sequence between the two arginines at positions 1 and 2 (18). Nevertheless, superimposition of SKD1 on p97 D1 shows that the Ca positions of the two arginines from mouse SKD1 (Arg290 and Arg291) and p97 D1 (Arg359 and Arg362) overlap (Figure 4). The first arginine interacts with the g-phosphate of the ATP molecule bound to the adjacent protomer. This arginine has been demonstrated to be essential for ATP hydrolysis in several AAA ATPases, analogous to the arginine finger found in guanosine triphosphatase-activating proteins (18). The second arginine may also facilitate ATP hydrolysis (18). For the ATP-bound form of NSF D2, there is no corresponding arginine finger residue (16,17). Instead, a lysine residue at the C-terminal end of the a4 helix from the neighboring protomer forms a hydrogen bond with the g-phosphate of ATP. These interactions between the g-phosphate and the Arg/Lys residues from the neighboring protomer may underlie the ATP-dependent hexameric ring formation (16,17). Oligomerization of the ATP-bound form of SKD1 in solution Size exclusion chromatography using an ATPase-deficient mutant (bearing a Glu-to-Gln substitution in the Walker B motif) of yeast Vps4p and human VPS4B has demon-

strated that these proteins undergo ATP-dependent assembly (6,9). We made a mouse SKD1 mutant in which the glutamic acid in the Walker B motif was changed to a glutamine (SKD1 E235Q) and performed size exclusion chromatography using the mutant protein. The apo form of His6-tagged SKD1 E235Q mutant (molecular weight 52.5 kDa) showed a major peak at around 60 kDa, which may correspond to a monomer, and a minor peak at around 240 kDa (Figure 5A). Mouse SKD1, however, behaved poorly during gel filtration chromatography, and the minor peak around 240 kDa lacked reproducibility depending on the sample preparation. The 30 kDa peak turned out to be contaminated degradation products because of rough purification of the sample. The presence of ADP did not essentially alter the profile, showing a predominant peak at 60 kDa and a negligible peak at a higher molecular weight (Figure 5A). In contrast, the addition of ATP significantly changed the profile, showing a major peak at around 350 kDa, which may correspond to about six to seven molecules of His6-SKD1 E235Q, although it is difficult to precisely estimate the number of subunits (Figure 5A). In addition, there still remained a minor fraction at 60 kDa, which may correspond to a monomer. The elution profile showed that the ATP-bound form of SKD1 primarily elutes as a high-molecular-weight oligomer, whereas the apo and

ADP-bound forms of SKD1 eluted mainly as monomers. The results suggested that addition of ATP but not ADP increased the oligomerized population of SKD1. In our hexameric ring model, Arg290 and Arg291 are supposed to promote ring formation through the interaction with g-phosphate of ATP. To test the hypothesis, we introduced R290A/R291A mutations into SKD1 E235Q mutant. The resulting triple mutant only showed single peak at 60 kDa both in the absence and in the presence of ATP, supporting the essential role of these arginines for ATP-dependent SKD1 oligomerization (Figure 5B). To estimate more precisely the molecular weight of SKD1 in solution, we then switched to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis using the mouse SKD1 E235Q mutant to estimate its oligomerization state. Guinier analysis showed that the molecular weights of the apo and ADPbound forms of SKD1 E235Q were 39 and 50 kDa, respectively (Table 1); these values were similar to those calculated from the pair correlation function P(r) function (44 and 50 kDa, respectively) and the estimated molecular weight of His6-tagged mouse SKD1 based on its amino acid sequence (52.5 kDa), suggesting that these proteins are monomers in solution (Figure 6). On the contrary, the molecular weights of the ATP-bound form of SKD1 E235Q calculated using the Guinier analysis and the P(r) function were 148 and 178 kDa, which correspond to a trimer and a tetramer, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 6). The SAXS data support the gel filtration data, which show that oligomerization of SKD1 is caused by ATP but not by ADP. The calculated molecular weight in the presence of ATP, however, was much lower than that of a 350 kDa oligomer observed in gel filtration chromatography, possibly because of heterogeneity of the sample containing both high- and low-molecular-weight species as observed in gel filtration chromatography.

different crystal packing. Although there still remains a possibility that the domain movement within the crystal lattice is restricted to some extent, we have observed a strikingly similar effect by ATP and ADP, both causing a nucleotide-dependent $208 domain rotation in the crystallized monomeric mouse SKD1/VPS4B. Whereas both ATP- and ADP-bound forms are compatible with a hexameric ring structure, only the ATP-bound form oligomerized in solution. These observations may explain the molecular mechanism underlying SKD1 assembly and disassembly during its ATPase cycle. Domain movements of the other AAAþ ATPases, such as HslU and p97 D1, during their respective ATPase cycles, have been studied in atomic detail (19,20). HslU can adopt four conformational states depending on the bound ligand (empty, SO4, ATP or ADP), each of which exhibits a different relative orientation of the a-helical domain with respect to the a/b domain (19). Large conformational changes in the domain structure of HslU are caused by the binding and release of nucleotides, but not by ATP hydrolysis, because the ATP- and ADP-bound conformations are relatively similar (19). The binding of nucleotides causes the a-helical domain to rotate by approximately 208 to close the nucleotide-binding pocket between the a/b and the a-helical domains (19). The direction of the movement of the domain in mouse SKD1 is almost the same as that of HslU (Figure 7). The rotation axis in mouse SKD1 is slightly ° shifted ($6 A) but is parallel to that of HslU (Figure 7C). In both proteins, the nucleotide binds between the a/b and the a-helical domains, bringing the two domains together (19). Although SKD1 assembles and disassembles depending on the bound nucleotide, HslU remains as a hexamer during the ATPase cycle. HslU is assembled in such a way that the nucleotide-dependent rotation axis of the a-helical domain is perpendicular to the sixfold ring axis (Figure 7B). The motion, therefore, does not disturb ring formation itself and has been proposed to generate Traffic 2008; 9: 2180­2189

Discussion
This is the first report of the structural comparison among the three nucleotide states (apo, ADP and ATP) of mouse SKD1/VPS4B. As we managed to soak nucleotides into apo form crystals, we could present nucleotide-induced conformational changes in the same crystal lattice by eliminating possible artificial structural differences because of

force that translocates protein substrates through the ring pore (19). On the contrary, the rotation axis of the a-helical domain of SKD1, which is not perpendicular to the sixfold ring axis (Figure 7A), causes a steric clash between the a1 helix of the a/b domain and the a8 helix of the a-helical domain from the neighboring molecule, which would force the ring to disassemble (Figure 2). p97 consists of an N-terminal domain and two tandem AAA domains D1 and D2. The full-length p97 forms a hexameric ring in the crystal where D1 and D2 rings are stacked in a head-to-tail fashion (20,21). In all the reported crystal structures of p97, one of its two AAA domains, D1, always binds ADP (15,20­22) and has been suggested to lack the ATP hydrolysis activity. However, the other AAA domain, D2, can bind adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP; an ATP analogue), ADPÁAlF3 (a transition state analogue) or ADP (20,21) and is thought to carry out ATP hydrolysis. Although cryo-electron microscopy (EM) and SAXS data show large conformational changes in the p97 forms bound to different nucleotides (23), X-ray crystal structures show only minor conformational changes (20). Substantial conformational changes have been observed between the ATP- and the ADPÁAlF3-bound states and between the ADP-bound and the apo states. The a-helical domain of p97 D2 is disordered in the ATP-bound and apo structures, whereas it is ordered in the ADP- and ADPÁAlF3-bound structures (20). Therefore, nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in the p97 D2 AAA domains are apparently different from the domain rotation observed in SKD1 and HslU. Movement of the p97 D2 domain is transmitted to the p97 D1 a domain through the D1D2 linker, and the D1 a domain slightly shifts relative to the D1 a/b domain (20), which differs from the large domain motion observed in SKD1. Traffic 2008; 9: 2180­2189

Although we have demonstrated the superimposition of SKD1 onto p97 D1 ring (Figures 2 and 4), SKD1 can be superimposed onto p97 D2 ring that gives similar results because of the structural homology and similar hexameric ring assembly of D1 and D2. The recently published rerefined full-length p97 structures by Davies et al. provided us reliable D2 structures to be compared with (24). The ADP- and ATP-bound forms of SKD1 can be well superimposed onto the hexameric ring structures of nucleotide-bound p97 D2 (PDB ID: 3CF2). However, apo form of SKD1 again showed less compatible interfaces between protomers upon superimposition to the p97 D2 ring (data not shown). Interestingly, p97 D2 domain alone crystallized as 14mer in which two heptameric rings stacked in a head-to-head fashion. The interface between two heptameric rings is formed by a15 helix of D2 protomers, which is absent in D1 and corresponds to a10 helix of SKD1. Superimposition of ATP-bound SKD1 onto the heptameric D2 ring revealed an excellent interface scores about À420 after side chain remodeling by ROSETTADOCK, which is better than those of superimposition on the hexameric D1 ring (about À240). However, the distances between the arginines (Arg290 and Arg291) from neighboring protomer and g-phosphate of ATP in the heptameric ring model is slightly longer than those of the hexameric ring model; average distances between g-phosphorus atom of ATP and Ca atoms of Arg290 and ° Arg291 are 9.1 and 11.0 A in the hexameric ring model, ° while 10.5 and 12.2 A in the heptameric ring model, respectively. Therefore, it seems that the hexameric ring model would have a little more advantage for ATP-dependent oligomerization than the heptameric ring model, although we can reasonably assume the possibility of heptameric ring formation of SKD1. 2185

Inoue et al.

It has been reported that wild-type yeast Vps4p forms a dimer (6) and the ATPase-deficient E233Q mutant forms a 10­12mer in the presence of ATP (6,9). Recently, cryoEM of yeast Vps4p was reported by two groups. Yu et al. reported EM structures of dodecameric (12mer) ring where two hexameric rings with different conformations are stacked (25). Hartman et al., however, reported a tetradecameric (14mer) ring model where two heptameric rings are stacked in a head-to-head fashion (26). The high degree of structural similarity between SKD1 and the protomers of p97 hexameric rings (D1 and D2) would support a hexameric ring assembly for SKD1. However, considering that p97 D2 alone crystallized in a stacked two heptameric rings (24), although it forms a hexameric ring in the full-length p97 crystal, it is tempting to speculate that SKD1 can form both hexameric and heptameric rings. Although we observed an oligomer of mouse SKD1 corresponding to 6­7mer in the presence of ATP by gel filtration chromatography, we could not observe higher order oligomeric states corresponding to 12­14mer. Interestingly, Scott et al. observed high-molecular-weight peak of human VPS4B, which may correspond to a double ring, but only with high protein concentrations (9). We failed to concentrate mouse SKD1 enough because it precipitated at high concentrations. Probably because of weaker interactions of mammalian VPS4B compared with yeast Vps4p, it would be difficult to observe higher order oligomers on gel filtration chromatography. Our SAXS experiment suggests that mouse SKD1 exists as a monomer in its apo and ADP-bound states, whereas it partially oligomerizes upon ATP binding. If the side chains of the arginine finger (Arg290-Arg291) from the neighboring molecule are properly positioned, the interface between the SKD1 subunits of the dimeric subcomplex may function as an ATPase. Indeed, the minichromosome maintenance ATPase has demonstrated that some dimeric subcomplexes can still show ATPase activity (27). We therefore suspect that although SKD1 monomers could oligomerize up to a hexamer or higher oligomers, a partially assembled subcomplex may be still functional as an ATPase. However, a complete ring formation of SKD1 protomers might be necessary to disassemble ESCRT complexes in a co-operative manner. After ATP hydrolysis, the electrostatic interaction between the arginine finger and the g-phosphate vanishes and the interaction between the protomers weakens. If ADP is released, a conformational change in SKD1 would further promote the disassembly of the oligomer. During the preparation of our manuscript, Xiao et al. reported the crystal structures of the apo and ADP-bound forms of yeast Vps4p (28). In contrast to the previous reports (6,9), they demonstrated that both the apo and the ADP-bound states of yeast Vps4p exist as monomers rather than dimers (28), which is consistent with our SAXS data of mouse SKD1. Their crystal structures of yeast Vps4p also exhibit nucleotide-dependent movements of the a/b and a-helical domains (Figure S2). Whereas their structure of the ADP-bound form of yeast Vps4p is similar to our ADP-bound structure of 2186

mouse SKD1 (Figure S2A), the phosphate-bound form of yeast Vps4p, in which only the phosphate portion of ADP is observed, exhibits an open conformation that is similar to the apo form of mouse SKD1 (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the apo form of yeast Vps4p showed a conformation that resembles that of the ADP-bound form of yeast Vps4p rather than the apo form of mouse SKD1 (Figure S2A). These structures altogether suggest that nucleotide-bound Vps4 assumes a closed conformation to accommodate the nucleotide, whereas nucleotide-free or partially nucleotide-bound (i.e. phosphate-bound) Vps4 may assume various conformations, including open structures. Supporting this assumption, the recently published another structure of apo yeast Vps4p (26) adopts an open conformation, which is similar to that of apo SKD1 (data not shown). Several partner proteins interact with the MIT domain or the b domain of SKD1. Although the MIT domain was not resolved in our SKD1 crystals, it has been reported to form a three-helix bundle structure and interact with ESCRT-III/charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP) proteins (29­32). The b domain of Vps4 interacts with the LIP5/SBP1/Vta1p protein (9), which promotes the assembly of Vps4 and enhances its ATPase activity (33). Although the molecular mechanisms of these interactions have yet to be elucidated, the assembly and disassembly of Vps4 may be modulated by LIP5/SBP1/Vta1p to aid the disassembly of ESCRT complexes during MVB biogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification and crystallization
A complementary DNA fragment encoding the entire mouse SKD1 was cloned into the pProExHTb plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and expressed as an N-terminally His6-tagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysE cells. The His6-tagged SKD1 protein was purified using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) Superflow affinity column (Qiagen) and a DEAE Sepharose FastFlow anion exchange column (GE Healthcare); the His6 tag was cleaved using tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen). Then, SKD1 was purified using a Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME) and 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). Crystallization experiments were performed by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method (34) and also manually using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 289 K. All crystallization reagents were purchased from Hampton Research and deCODE Genetics. Diffraction quality crystals of SKD1 (0.05 Â 0.05 Â 0.3 mm3) were obtained using 5 mg/mL protein, a reservoir solution containing 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and 100 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6.0) using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method after 5 days.

Improvement of the resolution and data collection
° To improve the resolutions of the SKD1 crystals, which were low ($8 A), the crystals were soaked in an arginine-containing buffer (200 mM arginine, 5% PEG 3350 and 100 mM MES at pH 6.0) for 1 day. The data set for the apo form of SKD1 was collected under cryogenic conditions: cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream at beamline PF-AR NW12A (Tsukuba, Japan). To prepare SKD1 crystals of the ATP-bound form, crystals were transferred into a soaking solution containing 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 15% (w/v) glycerol, 5% PEG 3350, 5 mM b-ME and 100 mM MES (pH 6.0) for 1 day. The data set for the ATP-bound form of SKD1 was collected at beamline

BL9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL; Stanford, CA, USA). The ADP-bound form was prepared using a two-step soaking processes. In the first step, SKD1 crystals were soaked in an argininecontaining buffer (200 mM arginine, 5% PEG 3350, 5 mM b-ME and 100 mM MES at pH 6.0) for 5 h. After arginine soaking, the crystals were soaked in 0.1 mM ADP, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 5% PEG 3350, 5 mM b-ME and 100 mM MES (pH 6.0) for 3 h. The data set for the ADP-bound form of SKD1 was collected at PF-AR NW12A. The diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 program (35).

Superflow affinity column (Qiagen). His6-SKD1 ($15 mM) was then loaded on Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) in 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM b-ME and 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). For nucleotide-bound conditions, His6SKD1 was incubated with 10 mM nucleotide (ATP or ADP) for 1 h and chromatographed with 1 mM nucleotide in the buffer. His6-SKD1 E235Q R290A R291A triple mutant was prepared and subjected to gel filtration chromatography in the same way. For molecular standards (Sigma), thyroglobulin, apoferritin, b-amylase, albumin and carbonic anhydrase were used. For SAXS experiments, Ni-NTA-purified His6-SKD1 E235Q was dialyzed in 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM b-ME, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). The solution X-ray scattering data were collected ° at PF BL-10C (Tsukuba, Japan) at l ¼ 1.488 A. For the analysis of the nucleotide-bound forms, 10 mM ATP or ADP was added into the dialyzed sample. Each sample solution (30 mL) was introduced into a thin-walled quartz capillary tube (path length 1 mm) and fixed in the sample holder at 298 K. The scattered X-rays were recorded on a position-sensitive proportional counter at 900 mm from the sample position with an exposure time of 600 seconds. The pair correlation function, P(r), was calculated from the scattering data using the GNOM program (41).

Structure determination and refinement
The crystal structures of the apo, ATP-bound and ADP-bound forms of SKD1 were solved by the molecular replacement method with MOLREP (36) using the structure of human VPS4B (PDB accession number: 1XWI) as a search model. The models of the apo, ATP-bound and ADP-bound forms were refined using CNS (37) and REFMAC5 (38) for the resolution ranges of ° 50­3.5, 50­3.0 and 50­3.2 A, respectively. Manual adjustments of the models were performed using TURBO-FRODO (39). The crystals of SKD1 contained one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. The ATP-bound form contained one ATP molecule and one putative Mg2þ ion. The ADPbound form contained one ADP molecule. The statistics for the data collection and structure refinement are summarized in Table 2. R.m.s.d. of the structure superpositions were calculated using the LSQKAB program (12). Figures were prepared using PYMOL (40). Domain motions were analyzed by DYNDOM (10). ROSETTADOCK (13,14) was used to optimize side chain conformations and score the interface of hexameric ring model of SKD1.
