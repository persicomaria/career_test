Biological Macromolecular Structure Center, Departments of Chemistry, Biochemistry and The Ohio State Biochemistry Program, The Ohio State University, 100 West 18th Avenue, Columbus OH 43210, USA To better understand the frequent occurrence of adjacent wobble pairs in ribosomal RNAs we have determined the crystal structure of the RNA duplex, r(GUGUGUA)dC with the 3H -terminal deoxy C residue. Two different crystal forms of the duplex were obtained and both belong to the rhombohedral space group, R3. Crystal form I has hexagonal unit cell Ê Ê Ê dimensions, a  b  40.82 A and c  66.09 A and diffracts to 1.58 A resolÊ Ê ution, while crystal form II has a  b  47.11 A and c  59.86 A, diffractÊ ing only to 2.50 A resolution. Both structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using different starting models. Inspite of the large differences in the cell dimensions the overall structures in both crystals are similar. Instead of the expected blunt-end duplex with four consecutive G Á U pairs, the slippage of the strands resulted in two different tandem G Á U/U Á G wobble pairs involving two of the central and two of the 5H overhang bases, still yielding a total of four wobble pairs. These tandem wobble pairs are ¯anked by two Watson ±Crick pairs. The A-type duplexes stack in the familiar head-to-tail fashion forming a pseudocontinuous helix. The wobble pairs of the present motif II (G Á U/ U ÁG) structure stack with a low twist angle of 25.3 in contrast to that of motif I (U Á G/G Á U), 38.1 . The four wobble pairs are characteristically heavily hydrated in both the grooves accounting for their stability.

Introduction
Adjacent GÁ U wobble pairs are frequently found to occur in ribosomal RNAs (Woese et al., 1983; Gutell et al., 1994). Certain speci®c sites of rRNAs, which are thought to be important for protein recognition, show the invariant presence of GÁ U wobble pairs, though in others they are often substituted by A ÁC wobbles (Gautheret et al., 1995). The three motifs containing adjacent GÁ U pairs are given in Scheme 1 (Gautheret et al., 1995). Motif I (U ÁG/GÁU) occurs seven times more frequently than motif II (G ÁU/U ÁG) (Gautheret et al., 1995). In fact, thermodynamic studies have shown motif I to be slightly more stable than motif II (He et al., 1991). The structure of the motif I r(GUAUGUA)dC has already been reported (Biswas et al., 1997). Here we report the structure of the alternating octamer, r(GUGUGUA)dC, in motif II with the reverse arrangement of tandem wobble pairs. The third motif, G Á U/G ÁU, has not been determined in

crystals of simple duplexes, but it has been determined in the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of group I introns (Cate et al., 1996). A conserved U Á G wobble pair is present at the 5H splice site of group I introns, where a guanine nucleotide initiates the splicing reaction (Cech, 1987; Barfod & Cech, 1989; Strobel & Cech, 1995). Wobble pairing at this site is known to be the most important factor for the autocatalytic cleavage of RNA. The present structure of the octamer was expected to be a blunt-end duplex with a central stretch of four consecutive G Á U wobble pairs (Figure 2(a), below). However, it was found that the strands have undergone slippage (Figure 2(b), below), yielding two tandem G Á U wobble pairs at

These two sets of tandem wobbles form four new wobble pairs, rather than the expected four consecutive wobbles. This is the ®rst structure with wobble pairs at the 5H overhang. Two crystal forms, I and II, having the same space group with quite different unit cell dimensions but similar structures were obtained.

Results and Discussions
Overall molecular structure Both crystals, I and II, of r(GUGUGUA)dC, are right-handed A-type duplexes. The crystal I is of Ê higher resolution (1.58 A) compared to crystal II Ê (2.50 A), more accurately analyzed, and will be discussed in detail. The ribose sugars are in the characteristic C3H -endo conformation. The x-displaÊ Ê cement ranges from À1.64 A to 1.70 A (Table 1). Though the gross structures of crystal form I and crystal form II are similar, the conformational differences are rather large, particularly at the region containing the two 5H overhangs, r.m.s. deviÊ ation 1.79 A (Figure 1). The sequence was designed to study the nature of a RNA helix with four consecutive G Á U wobble base-pairs at the center (Figure 2(a)), but the strands underwent a slippage with a two base 5H (G-U) overhang, which forms two new G Á U pairs with neighboring strands, in addition to the two at the center (Figures 2(b) and (c)). The duplexes are stacked in columns forming a pseudocontinuous in®nite RNA helix. Motifs I (Biswas et al., 1997) and II crystals could be grown only in the presence of cobaltic hexammine chloride. Neither crystal could be obtained with magnesium chloride. In either crystal structure the cobalt hexammine cations could not be located. It is interesting that in the recent structure of the P4-P6 domain of the group I introns, cobalt hexammine not only enhanced the growth of the crystals but was also bound in the major groove of both the tandem GÁU/U ÁG (motif II) and G Á U/ G Á U (motif III) wobble pairs (Cate & Doudna, 1996). Similar major groove binding of cobalt hexammine (Jack et al., 1977) and ruthenium pentammine (Rubin et al., 1982) to the single G4 Á U69 wobble pair of Phe-tRNA has been observed. Helical parameters and base stacking The helical parameters of the two forms of the alternating octamer r(GUGUGUA)dC, calculated with the program NUPARM (Bhattacharyya & Bansal, 1990) show features characteristic of alternating sequences. The variations in the helical parameters (Table 1) imply crystal packing effects and the ¯exibility of the oligonucleotide duplex. The roll and the twist angles of the adjacent wobble steps, at the overhang as well as at the interior, are low compared to those of the Watson ± Crick steps (Table 1). The average twist of the GÁ U wobble step is 25.3 , which is signi®cantly lower than the

average twist angle (31.3 ) of the two Watson± Crick steps. The canonical ®ber A-RNA duplexes have an average twist of 32.7 (Arnott et al., 1972). The observed base stacking of the tandem wobble pairs (Figures 3(b) and 4(b)) and the ¯anking Watson ±Crick and the wobble pairs (Figures 3(a), 3(c), 4(a) and 4(c)) govern the large variations in the twist angles. The roll angles at the adjacent wobbles (Table 1) are smaller for the purine-pyrimidine steps than the pyrimidine-purine base steps, similar to those observed in B-DNA (Calladine, 1982) and A-RNA (Dock-Bregeon et al., 1989).

Stability of the wobble pairs The two important factors contributing to the stability of the adjacent wobbles is base stacking and hydration. Thermodynamic studies on hexaand pentanucleotides have shown that overhang nucleosides can stabilize RNA duplexes (Freier et al., 1985). The present structure illustrates how the overhang bases form wobble pairs with a symmetry related duplex to stabilize the RNA molecule. Motif II wobbles are known to be thermodynamically less stable (2.0 kcal/mole) compared to motif I wobbles (He et al., 1991). Even though the hydration of the GÁ U wobble pairs at the center of the helix is similar in both motifs (I and II), they differ in their base stacking. Motif II G Á U pairs stack with a lower twist angle (25.3 ) with intrastrand overlap of the bases and a higher twist angle (32.1 ) with the ¯anking Watson± Crick base-pairs involving a purine-purine interstrand stacking. The stacking in motif I is opposite to that observed in motif II, the U Á G/G Á U step has a higher twist angle of 38.1 resulting in purine-purine interstrand stacking and a lower twist angle (26.5 ) between the wobble and the ¯anking Watson ±Crick base-pair steps with intrastrand stacking. This difference in stacking may be responsible

for the greater thermodynamic stability of motif I over motif II (He et al., 1991). A network of water molecules around the GÁ U wobble pairs compensates for the loss in the third hydrogen bond of the standard GÁ C base-pair (Figure 5). In the minor groove of the wobble pairs a water molecule bridges N2 of guanine to the O2 of uridine, which may compensate for the third hydrogen bond in G Á C pair. In addition, the O2 of the uridine is also linked to O2H . This water is conserved in all the four wobble pairs, those at the overhang as well as at the center of the helix. The four minor groove water molecules, average BÊ value of 10 A2, can be considered to be an integral Ê part of the molecule. In the 2.50 A structure, the minor groove of only one of the wobble pairs is hydrated. In the major groove, O4 of uridine and O6 of the guanine are hydrogen-bonded by a water molecule (Figure 5). This water bridge could further compensate for the third hydrogen bond of the Watson± Crick GÁ C base-pair. This major

groove water bridge was also observed in r(GUAUGUA)dC (Biswas et al., 1997). The water bridges ¯anking the wobble pair could stabilize the G Á U pair as much as the third hydrogen bond of G Á C pairs. Thus we may implicate hydration, in addition to base stacking, to be a major determinant of the stability of the wobble pairs in the RNA helix. Hydration of the molecules Hydration of the duplexes is important for their stabilization and packing in the crystal. A total of 71 ordered solvent molecules were found in the hydration shell of form I, the majority of which line the sugar phosphate backbone. In the major groove N7 of almost all the purines are hydrogenbonded via water molecules. The respective N7 atoms of the three residues, G3, A7, and A15, are linked by a single water bridge to O1P. In one instance the N7 and O6 atoms of G11 are

linked through two water bridges. The purines can also be directly linked to O4 of adjacent pyrimidines as in: G1/N7 . . . W . . . U2/O4 and G13/ N7 . . . W . . . U14/O4. The minor groove O2 atoms of pyrimidines and N3 and/or N2 atoms of guanine residues, particularly those of the wobble pairs, are heavily hydrated. The extensive back-

bone hydration appears to be an inherent feature of RNA helices due to the contribution of the 2H -hydroxyl group, which is absent in DNA molecules. The 2H -hydroxyl groups are all hydrated and sometimes are linked to the adenine N3 of the same residue (A7 and A15) or to the uridine O2 atom of the same residue (U2, U4, U6, U10 and U14 ). O2H

W . . . U12/O1P, are found in the form II structure. The phosphate oxygen atoms of all the Watson ±Crick base-pairs are hydrated as in the structure of r(GUAUGUA)dC (Biswas et al., 1997). Double water bridges linking adjacent phosphate anionic oxygen atoms are also found in four instances: U2/O1P . . . W . . . W . . . G3/O1P, U12/ O1P . . . W . . . W . . . G13/O1P, G13/O1P . . . W . . . W . . . U14/O1P and U14/O1P . . . W . . . W . . . A15/ O1P, particularly in strand 2 (Wahl et al., 1996).

Thus, this helix with the overhang and 50% wobble pairs is stable due to the extensive hydration by bridging water molecules. The water molecules lining the backbone also promote intermolecular interactions and are crucial to the packing of the duplexes in the crystal. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding Interactions Intermolecular interactions are both direct lattice contacts and water-mediated. Water-mediated interactions involve the adjacent wobble pairs at the 5H overhang site. The direct contacts involve the N2 atoms of guanine, O2H atoms of sugar and the O1P and O2P of phosphate groups. The common direct contact is between O2H and O1P or N2 as in: U6/O2H and G5*/O1P, G13/O2H and U12*/O2P, A15/O2H and G3*/N2 (an astrisk (*)

denotes a symmetry-related duplex). The sugar molecules at the junction of the overhang sites, which do not have a phosphate, exhibit a C-H Á Á Á O hydrogen bond between the C2H -H2H of cytosine (in C8 and C16) and O4H of guanine (in G1 and G9) of a symmetry-related duplex. Such hydrogen bonds may stabilize the end-to-end packing of the duplexes into an in®nite helix. Though weaker in comparison to conventional hydrogen bonds, C-H Á Á Á O hydrogen bonds are frequent in biological molecules (Wahl & Sundaralingam, 1997 and references cited therein).

twist angle can be expected with the 3H -¯anking Watson± Crick base-pair, as in motif I.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis and purification The oligonucleotide sequence, r(GUGUGUA)dC, was synthesized by an automated nucleic acid synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, model 391) based on the solid phase phosphoramidite chemistry. The octamer was cleaved from the solid support using a 3:1 ammonia/ ethanol solution and incubated overnight in the same solution at 55 C for deprotection. This was followed by lyophilization and subsequent deprotection of the 2H -hydroxyl group by incubation with 0.8 ml of 1 M tetrabutylammonium ¯uoride at room temperature for 24 hours. An equal volume (0.8 ml) of 0.1 M triethylamine acetate (TEAA) was added, the mixture lyophilized and precipitated with ammonium acetate/ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in 400 ml of buffer (0.05 M ammonium acetate, (pH 7.0), 20% (v/v) acetonitrile) and puri®ed further by ion exchange FPLC, using a gradient of 0 to 1 M lithium chloride in 20% acetonitrile. The collected fraction was lyophilized, ethanol precipitated and dissolved in deionized water. This puri®ed sample was again lyophilized, weighed to the nearest 0.01 mg and a stock solution containing 4 mM single-stranded oligonucleotide was prepared in water to be used for crystallization trials. Crystallization and data collection The hanging drop vapor diffusion method was used for crystallization. Two polymorphic crystal forms were obtained using similar conditions.

Conclusion
The base stacking interactions between the wobble pairs and the ¯anking Watson ±Crick pairs depend on whether they are in motif I, II or III. In motif I (U ÁG/G ÁU) there is a loss in stacking interactions of the uridine residues of the wobble step, while in motif II (G ÁU/U ÁG) a similar loss in pyrimidine stacking is observed twice, both with the 5H and 3H -¯anking Watson ±Crick base-pair steps. This may be the reason for the greater thermodynamic stability of motif I over motif II (He et al., 1991). The base stacking interactions and the stability of the motif III, GÁU/G Á U, can thus be predicted to be intermediate between that of motif I and motif II. The motif III tandem wobbles will stack with high twist angles with the 5H -¯anking Watson± Crick base-pair, similar to motif II, while a low

Tandem G ÁU Alternating with Tandem Watson ±Crick Pairs Form I of r(GUGUGUA)dC The crystals were grown using 1 mM RNA (singlestranded concentration), 0.5 mM cobaltic hexammine chloride, 40 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0) and 10% (v/v) MPD in the drop against 55% MPD in the reservoir at 18 C. Crystals appeared within a week and continued to grow for a couple of weeks. Data collection was done from a single crystal measuring 0.7 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm at 18 C, using an in-house Siemens area detector mounted on a four-circle goniometer, with a MacScience rotating anode source operating at 40 kV and 100 mA and a graphite monochromator to select CuKa radiation. The crystal-to-detector distance was 12.0 cm. A phi scan was performed over 180 at 2theta of 40 with a 0.25 step and a 60 seconds exposure Ê time per frame to collect data to 1.48 A resolution. Two sets of omega scans (over 60 ) were then performed at 2theta of 40 : phi  0 , chi  90 and phi  90 , chi  45 , respectively. The crystal belongs to the rhombohedral Ê space group R3, with unit cell dimensions of a  32.26 A and a  78.49 and a duplex in the asymmetric unit. The corresponding hexagonal unit cell dimensions are a  Ê Ê b  40.82 A, c  66.09 A and g  120 . The data sets were merged, Rsym of 4.68%, and the data were proÊ cessed using XENGEN 2.0 software. Data up to 1.58 A, containing 4314 re¯ections with F 5 1.5sF, were incorporated in the ®nal structure re®nement.

coef®cient of 59%. This was followed by a translation search and rigid body re®nement to yield a solution with an R-factor of 49%. The coordinates of the structure were displayed with the program CHAIN (Sack & Quiocho, 1992) and the packing showed no collision between the symmetry-related molecules. A rigid body re®nement using the program package X-PLOR 3.0 (Brunger, 1992) followed by positional least-squares reÊ Ê ®nement using data between 8.0 A and 1.58 A dropped the R-factor to 31.8%. A 2Fo À Fc difference density map was calculated and inspected visually. The correct base sequence for the blunt-end duplex was obtained by changing adenine 3 of strand 1 and adenine 11 of strand 2 to guanine bases (Figure 2(a)). This was then subjected to simulated annealing (Brunger, 1988) to reduce the model bias by initially heating the system to 4000 K and slow cooling to 300 K with 0.5 fs sampling intervals. Positional least-squares re®nement followed by a temperature factor re®nement gave an R-factor of 29.0%. Inspection of the 2Fo À Fc maps showed that the ®rst two pairs instead of being GÁ C and A Á U Watson ± Crick base-pairs appeared in the wobble con®guration (Figure 2(a)), while the third and the fourth pairs instead of the expected wobble pairs, GÁU and U ÁG, turned out to be Watson ± Crick pairs. This observation was puzzling momentarily. However, the other half of the duplex, base-pairs 5 through 8, had the expected basepairing. Further inspection of the maps showed a break in the electron density and therefore the absence of the phosphate in the backbone of strand 2 between residues 14 and 15, indicating a downward slippage of this strand by two bases. To further con®rm this ®nding the ®rst base (G) was omitted, the structure re®ned and the maps clearly showed the base to be guanine (Figure 2). Similarly, the 15th (A) base was omitted and the structure re®nement showed it to be an adenine (Figure 2). The clarity of these maps thus con®rmed the slippage of the strands giving rise to a two base-pair overhang on the 5H end (Figure 2(b)) and also con®rmed the correctness of the structure analysis. The correct model was subjected to simulated annealing, followed by positional and temperature factor re®nement resulting in an R-factor of 25%. The solvents were then located in difference density maps, Fo À Fc contoured at 3s and the 2Fo À Fc contoured at 1s. A total of 71 water molecules were picked in steps using the above criteria. Re®nement of the ®nal model containing 334 atoms of the nucleic acid and 71 water oxygen atoms yielded an R-factor of 21.2% and an R-free of 27.7%.

Form II of r(GUGUGUA)dC The crystallization condition was similar to that of form I, except that no MPD was added to the drop and that in the reservoir was 60%. Crystals appeared within two days and were allowed to grow for one week. Data were collected from a single crystal measuring 0.2 mm Â 0.15mm Â 0.15 mm at room temperature. However, instead of our Siemens area detector, our inhouse R-axis IIc imaging plate, with CuKa radiation operating at 50 kV and 100 mA, was used. Data were collected and processed using the R-axis software of Molecular Structure Corporation. The crystal indexed to the rhombohedral space group R3, but with slightly larÊ ger unit cell dimensions (than form I) of a  33.72 A and a  88.62 , corresponding to a hexagonal unit cell of Ê Ê a  b  47.11 A, c  59.86 A and g  120 . Even though the two crystal forms have the same space group, the unit cell dimensions differ by as much as 13% on a/b and 10% on c. A total of 1524 unique re¯ections to Ê 2.50 A with F 5 1.5sF were used for structure solution and re®nement.

Form II The hexagonal unit cell dimensions of crystal form II Ê Ê are a  b  47.11 A, c  59.86 A and g  120 . In this case, a different model, r(GUAUAUA)dC, with Ê Ê a  b  43.07 A, c  59.36 A and g  120 as hexagonal unit cell dimensions (Wahl et al., 1996) was used. Similar to form I, this structure solution was also started with a blunt-end duplex. A rotation-translation search in the Ê Ê resolution range 8.0 A to 4.0 A gave a 70% correlation and an R-factor of 48% using program package X-PLOR 3.0 (Brunger, 1992). To improve the position of the model rigid body re®nement was carried out using data Ê Ê between 8.0 A and 2.5 A which brought down the R-factor to 28.6% (Brunger, 1992). This, followed by positional and temperature factor re®nement, gave an R-factor of 23.2%. Incorporating the correct bases as in form I, simulated annealing and a subsequent positional and tem-

Structure solution and refinement of r(GUGUGUA)dC Form I The hexagonal unit cell dimensions of crystal I with Ê motif II wobble pairs (GÁU/U Á G) are a  b  40.82 A Ê and c  66.09 A. The atomic coordinates of the earlier motif I (U ÁG/G Á U) structure, r(GUAUGUA)dC (Biswas et al., 1997), were used as the starting model. The model belongs to the same space group with very similar unit Ê Ê cell dimensions, a  b  39.71 A and c  68.15 A. The AMoRe program package (Navaza, 1994) was used for molecular replacement. A rotation search using a bluntÊ end duplex and re¯ections in the resolution range 8.0 A Ê Ê to 2.5 A with a search radius of 12 A gave a correlation

perature factor re®nement gave an R-factor of 22% for the blunt-end model. A visual inspection of the maps on CHAIN again exhibited the same base-pairing problems as in form I, suggesting that this structure also had a slippage of the strands with a 5H overhang. The correct 5H overhang structure was subjected to simulated annealing. Further re®nement gave an R-factor of 21%. Water molecules were added as before (form I). The ®nal model, containing 334 atoms of the nucleic acid and 37 water oxygen atoms, re®ned to an R-factor of 16.5% and an R-free of 17.9%. The crystal and re®nement parameters for both the forms are listed in Table 2. Since crystal I was of considerably higher resolution than crystal II most of the structural details presented are of crystal I. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with NDB (Berman et al., 1992), with accession number AHH089.
