Peptide Synthesis. Peptides were prepared by automated solid phase peptide synthesis on an Advanced ChemTech 396 synthesizer employing standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected amino acids, 1-hydroxy-1H-benzotriazole (HOBt)/O-(benzotriazol-1yl)N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) coupling reagents (Novabiochem) and piperidine deprotection. Final side-chain deprotection and cleavage from the polyaniline-poly(ethylene)glycol-polystyrene resin (PAL-PEG-PS, PerSeptive Biosystems) was carried out in a cocktail of 92.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 1% triisopropyl silane, and 2.5% H2O, 2.5% ethanedithiol for 2 hours to afford the peptides with C-terminal amides and N-terminal amines. Peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC on a YMC C18 preparative column using a linear gradient from 7­70 % acetonitrile in water with 0.2 % TFA. Purity was confirmed by analytical HPLC and correct mass validated by ES-MS on a Mariner electrospray mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Stock Solutions. Peptide concentrations were estimated by measuring their absorbance at 280 nm in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and using extinction coefficients calculated from reported values of 5685 M-1 cm-1 for tryptophan, 1285 M-1 cm-1 for tyrosine, and 125 M-1 cm-1 for cystine.[1] Concentrations of lanthanide stock solutions made from LnCl3 salts (Aldrich) in 1 mM HCl were determined by complexometric titration.[2] Crystallization. The LBT peptide was stored at 4°C in 10 mM Hepes, 1.2 mM TbCl3 pH 7.0 at 2.2 mg/ml. Initial crystallization conditions were obtained by sparse matrix screening using a commercially available kit (Hampton Research Crystal Screens I and II).[3] Upon optimization, crystals of the Tb3+ LBT complex were grown from 3.7 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris at pH 6.5 and 40% t-butanol by the vapor-diffusion method with sitting drop geometry. Equal volumes (1.5 µL) of protein solution and well solution were set up under 20 µL of Paraffin oil (Hampton Research). The crystals were thin needles belonging to space group C2 with unit-cell dimensions of a = 52.16 Å, b = 22.27 Å, c = 30.03 Å, =103.89°.

Data Collection and Processing. For data collection crystals were picked out from under the Paraffin oil, which also acts as a cryoprotectant, and flash frozen in a stream of N2 gas cooled by liquid nitrogen. The single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data set was collected to 2.0Å using CuK radiation on a Rigaku RU300 X-Ray generator fitted with a RAXIS-IV++ area detector. The data-collection statistics are summarized in Table S1. The DENZO and SCALEPACK package was used for determination of the unit-cell parameters, data indexing, reduction, and scaling.[4] The unit-cell dimensions were consistent with two molecules/asymmetric unit and 46% solvent content using a Matthews coefficient of 2.3.5 SAD Phasing and Model Building. The structure was solved using SAD phasing on Tb3+. SOLVE version 2.03 was used to locate two Tb3+ sites in the asymmetric unit corresponding to one Tb3+ site per molecule.[6] The initial map was improved slightly using solvent flattening in the program SHARP version 2.0.1.[7] Two aromatic residues, a tyrosine and a tryptophan, which fall in the middle of the sequence were easily discerned in the electron density map. They were fitted into the density using the molecular graphics package O.[8] A polyalanine chain was extended from both ends of the aromatic residues. Once this model was fitted into the first monomer, the model was then translated into the density corresponding to the second monomer, using the Tb3+ and the aromatic residues positions as a guide. NCS averaging was performed using the program CNS, allowing nine of the total of seventeen residues in each polypeptide chain to be fitted.[9] At this point the cap on the Cterminal was also visible. Refinement. The initial round of refinement including rigid-body refinement and simulated annealing using torsional dynamics performed against the maximum likelihood/HerdricksonLattman (MLHL) minimization target incorporating the observed SAD phases from SHARP using the program CNS. For statistical cross-validation 10% of the data were excluded (for calculation of Rfree[10]). After the initial rounds of refinement, clear density at both the Ntermini and the C-termini allowed the chain to be extended by five additional amino acids, thus accounting for all 17 amino acids in the peptide. The model was further refined without NCS averaging using a combination of simulated annealing and minimization, alternating with manual rebuilding using sigmaA weighted 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc electron density maps. The final model was checked using a simulated-annealing composite omit map. The automated water-picking program in CNS was used to assign water molecules in the structure, all of which were visible in the Fo­Fc electron density map at 3. In the last stages, the group and individual B-factors were refined, resulting in final crystallographic R-factors of Rcryst = 0.16 and Rfree = 0.20. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot showed 85.7% of 17 residues fall within the most favored region and 14.3% fall in the additionally allowed region, as defined by PROCHECK.11 Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Coordinates for the LBT Tb3+ complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Note that residues in the PDB are numbered such that 100 has been added to each residue number referred to in the text. Distances between protein (chain A) and Tb3+ are listed in Table S2.

Luminescence Spectroscopy. Emission spectra were recorded on a Fluoromax 3 instrument (Jobin Yvon Horiba) in 1-cm pathlength quartz cells. Tryptophan-sensitized Tb3+ emission spectra were collected by exciting at 280 nm and scanning from 300 to 600 nm; a 315-nm longpass filter removed interference from harmonic doubling. Spectra were corrected for emission intensity by using manufacturer-supplied correction factors. Slit widths were 5 nm and 5 nm for excitation and emission slits, respectively. Spectra were measured at pH 7.0 in 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer and 100 mM NaCl. Luminescence spectra obtained from Tb3+ titrations were analyzed with the program SPECFIT/32 (Spectrum Software Associates, version 3.0.30) to obtain apparent binding constants. Luminescence lifetimes were recorded on the same Fluoromax 3 instrument, equipped with a Spex 1934D3 phosphorimeter. The intensity at 544 nm was monitored at 30 µs increments for 15 ms after an initial 50 µs delay following a 70 ms excitation pulse at 280 nm from a Xenon flash lamp. Slit widths were 5 nm for excitation and emission slits. The resulting data were fit in Kaleidograph software to a single exponential decay of the form I(t) = I(0)e(t/ ), where I(t) is the intensity at time t after the excitation pulse, I(0) is the initial intensity at t = 0 (i.e. after the initial 50 µs delay), and  is the luminescence lifetime. The number of Tb3+-coordinated water molecules (q) can be estimated by measuring the rate constant of luminescence decay (-1) in both H2O and D2O solutions, and fitting to the equation q = A'(kcorr), where A' = 5 ms and kcorr = (kH2O ­ kD2O ­ 0.06 ms-1) for Tb3+. The value for -1 in D2O was estimated by measuring the lifetime of peptide-Tb complexes in solutions of varying H2O:D2O ratios from 0.2 to 1. The y-intercept of a plot of -1 vs. the mole fraction of H2O corresponds to the value in pure D2O.
