Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile and harmful pathogen in both hospital- and community-associated infections that range from superficial to systemic infections. S. aureus engages a multitude of mechanisms to subvert the innate immune response of the host, including inhibition of complement activation and neutralization of anti-microbial peptides. In addition, inflammatory cell and phagocyte recruitment is an integral part of the innate defense to staphylococcal infection and comprises a wellcoordinated multi-step cascade of adhesive events. Recent and rapidly growing experimental evidence indicates the existence of a machinery of anti-adhesive and antichemotactic moieties of S. aureus that allow the bacterium to interfere with specific adhesive steps of the homing mechanism of leukocytes. Understanding the functions of these S. aureus-derived anti-inflammatory agents could also provide the platform for designing new therapies in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Introduction Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile and harmful pathogen in both hospital- and community-associated infections. It is a frequent cause of both superficial infections, such as abscesses of wounds, and invasive disease, such as endocarditis, catheter-related sepsis and osteomyelitis [1]. An additional challenge is the global epidemic of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with the more recent extensive spread of specific clones in the community and a specific disease profile, and the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant isolates [2,3]. The survival of the bacteria in the host is facilitated by several mechanisms. (i) Some S. aureus strains are protected by a polysaccharide capsule that impedes opsonophagocytosis [4]. (ii) S. aureus secretes cytolytic toxins and tissue-cleaving enzymes such as proteases, a hyaluronidase, a lipase and a nuclease [5]. (iii) S. aureus expresses a multitude of adhesion factors that mediate interactions with host cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) allowing for an efficient colonization [6,7]. The function of these adhesion molecules is partially redundant, as more than one staphylococcal adhesin usually recognizes a single host ECM component. These adhesins can be classified into `microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules' (MSCRAMMs) and `secretable expanded repertoire

adhesive molecules' (SERAMs). MSCRAMMs constitute a family of >20 members that recognize ECM components such as fibrinogen and fibronectin, and are anchored to the bacterial wall peptidoglycan by a mechanism that involves the enzyme sortase and a sorting signal that comprises a conserved LPXTG motif [6­8]. SERAMs are a group of 5 structurally unrelated secreted adhesins, including the fibrinogen binding protein A, the coagulase, the extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (Efb), the ECM binding protein and the extracellular adherence protein (Eap), which interact with a broad array of host ligands thereby mediating bacteria adhesion but also interfering with host defense mechanisms [6]. (iv) S. aureus has developed several mechanisms to compromise the innate immune response of the host [9,10]. Among these, staphylococcal superantigens target adaptive immunity as they bridge MHC class II with T cell receptors independent of antigen presentation, thereby inducing an enormous mitogenic T cell response and massive systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in toxic shock [11]. In addition, S. aureus-derived factors can subvert all three axes of the innate response targeted against the bacterium, namely the antimicrobial peptides, the complement system, and the recruitment and actions of phagocytes. A summary of virulence factors of S. aureus can be found in Table 1. The present review will focus on the mechanisms of S. aureus to evade the innate immune response. As the complement-inhibitory activities of S. aureus were recently reviewed thoroughly elsewhere [12], a strong emphasis will be laid on mechanisms that involve the rapidly growing group of bacterial anti-adhesive and anti-chemotactic factors. Here, recent advances concerning our understanding of the inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment by S. aureus factors and the potential therapeutic implications thereof, which extend to the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, will be discussed. Inactivation of anti-microbial peptides by S. aureus Antimicrobial peptides such as defensins, cathelicidins and lysozyme, have the propensity to mediate rapid lysis of bacteria. a-Defensins are small cationic peptides that are present in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and in some epithelial cells. They are secreted both intracellularly following phagocytosis and extracellularly and are incorporated into prokaryotic cell membranes, provoking bacterial lysis [13]. Two mechanisms confer defensin resistance on S. aureus. (i) Modifications of cell wall teichoic acid, lipoteichoic

acid and a membrane phospholipid result in lowering of the net negative charge of the bacterial cell surface and thereby in a reduced affinity for the cationic defensins [14]. (ii) Although staphylokinase (which has a 67% prevalence amongst S. aureus strains) is secreted by S. aureus and acts as a plasminogen activator, the enzyme also forms a complex with a-defensins, thereby neutralizing their bactericidal effect [15]. The importance of these anti-defensin mechanisms in bacterial virulence has been demonstrated in animal infection models [16]. Similarly, the staphylococcal metalloproteinase aureolysin inactivates another human antimicrobial peptide, the cathelicidin LL-37 [17]. In addition to inactivation of antimicrobial peptides, S. aureus can also utilize the interaction of certain antimicrobial peptides with S. aureus factors to augment the activity of the latter. As

recently demonstrated, the interaction between cathelicidin and staphylokinase results in enhanced plasminogenmediated fibrinolysis and enhanced bacterial dissemination and infection in a pneumonia model [18]. Furthermore, acetylation of muramic acid, a component of cell-wall peptidoglycan, renders S. aureus resistant to lysozyme, another bactericidal protein of the innate immune response [19]. Complement-inhibitory activities of S. aureus The complement system serves a major function in the immune response to S. aureus infection. The central step in complement activation is the cleavage of C3 that results in the generation of the chemoattractant and anaphylatoxin C3a and C3b, which following activation is covalently bound through thioester linkage onto microbial surfaces,

thereby promoting phagocytosis. Three different initiation pathways, the classical, the lectin and the alternative pathway [20], generate a C3 convertase, each of which is composed of a serine protease and a protein cofactor to cleave C3 efficiently. The classical and lectin convertase is C2a­C4b, whereas the convertase of the alternative pathway is Bb­C3b. Accumulation of C3b changes the convertase specificity to cleave C5, producing the chemoattractant C5a and C5b, which then harbors the terminal complement proteins to form the lytic membrane attack complex consisting of C5b­C9. The complement cascade functions (i) to opsonize bacteria (through C3b that serves as a ligand for complement receptors on phagocytes), (ii) to chemoattract phagocytes (through C3a and C5a), and (iii) to perturb bacterial membranes of Gram-negative bacteria (C5b­C9), whereas Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus are not affected by the membrane attack complex. Activation of, and bystander cell lysis by, complement is tightly regulated by inhibitory serum proteins such as factors H and I, by the C4b-binding protein, by membrane-bound decay-accelerating factor or CD59, and by soluble proteins such as vitronectin [20­22]. Whereas the most common complement inhibitory strategy of various pathogens is to recruit host inhibitors of complement to the bacterial surface [22], S. aureus has developed an alternative strategy, in which it secretes several factors that inhibit complement. Protein A (present in virtually all S. aureus strains) binds to the Fc part of IgG, thereby blocking Fc-receptor-mediated bacterial phagocytosis and also interfering with the initiation of the classical pathway of complement activation [23]. Whereas protein Adeficient S. aureus strains are more efficiently phagocytosed by neutrophils [9], the in vivo evidence regarding virulence of protein A-deficient S. aureus strains in animal models of infection is controversial. Protein A was identified as a virulence factor in arthritis and septic death [24], whereas little or no difference in virulence was found in other models [25,26]. However, whether the differences in virulence are owing to impaired phagocytosis of protein A-producing S. aureus by neutrophils in vivo is not established. In addition, another important immunoregulatory function of protein A was recently described that is separable from its anti-complement activities. Protein A specifically binds to the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) receptor 1 (TNFR1), and the subsequent proinflammatory signaling participates in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal pneumonia [27]. Protein A can also limit TNFa signaling by stimulating shedding of TNFR1 by activating TACE, the TNFR1 sheddase [28]. Intriguingly, the expression of protein A is regulated by the Panton-Valentine leukocidin, which is associated with the current outbreak of community-associated MRSA, thereby causing necrotizing pneumonia [29]. Moreover, staphylokinase-triggered plasmin formation can cleave both IgG and C3b, thereby impairing the activation of the classical complement pathway and phagocytosis [30]. Another factor with potential anti-complement activity is the staphylococcal superantigen-like protein-7 (SSL-7). SSLs are a family of 11 secreted proteins [31] that are prevalent in nearly all S. aureus strains and have structural similarity to superantigens, but owing to the lack of amino acid residues important for MHC class II or
www.sciencedirect.com

TCR binding, they do not act as superantigens [31,32]. The 23 kD SSL-7 binds to the complement factor C5 and could putatively prevent further complement activation. In addition, SSL-7 binds to human IgA and competes for the binding of IgA to cell surface FcaRI [33]. The 15 kD SERAM, extracellular fibrinogen binding molecule (Efb), is secreted by S. aureus and can bind to fibrinogen. Efb is present in 70­80% of S. aureus strains. Efb deficiency renders S. aureus less virulent in a mouse wound-healing model [34]. Efb interacts with the thioestercontaining C3d domain of C3, thereby preventing the deposition of C3b on the bacterial surface and blocking opsonophagocytosis [35,36]. Structure­function studies revealed that Efb binding to C3d perturbs the overall conformation of C3, rendering it incapable of being converted to C3b [37]. In addition, direct interaction between Efb and C3b will inactivate the central complement protein. As C3 concentration in the plasma is very high, inhibitors targeting C3 have to be very potent. Thus, the dual function of Efb to block activation of C3 and to perturb the structure of activated C3b implies that Efb could provide the template for designing complement inhibitors, to be used in inflammatory disorders, such as hyperacute rejection of organ transplantation [20,37]. Another very efficient complement inhibitor is the 10 kD staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN). SCIN (prevalent in 90% of strains) can block complement activation mediated by all initiation pathways. This inhibitory action of SCIN is attributed to its propensity to interact with the convertases C2a­C4b and Bb­C3b, by stabilizing these enzyme complexes on the bacterial surface and thereby impairing their enzymatic activities. The convertases are normally transiently active, as their dissociation is a prerequisite step for the activation of the subsequent steps in the complement cascade. Thus, SCIN prevents C3b formation, opsonophagocytosis and lytic complex formation [38]. Inflammatory cell recruitment As an immediate response towards infection, leukocytes, predominantly neutrophils, extravasate into sites of infection. The highly coordinated recruitment of leukocytes requires a multistep sequence of adhesive and migratory events, mediated by the interplay between host- or bacteriaderived chemoattractants with three classes of adhesion receptors: selectins, integrins and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. They mediate the following steps in cell­cell interactions: (i) initial blood-flow-dependent selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling; (ii) leukocyte triggering by chemokines and chemoattractants, leading to integrin activation; (iii) firm leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, with (iv) subsequent transendothelial migration in addition to the migration through the subendothelial matrix guided by chemokines and chemoattractants [39] (Figure 1a). Leukocyte rolling indicates their initial tethering on the endothelial cell surface mediated by reversible interactions between selectins, such as the E-, P- or L-selectins with their sialyl Lewis X-containing carbohydrate ligands, such as Pselectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). The earliest component of the acute response to infection is the interaction between neutrophil PSGL-1 and endothelial P-selectin,

(i) Selectinmediated rolling, (ii) chemokine-induced leukocyte activation, (iii) firm adhesion mediated by b1- and b2-integrins and their endothelial counter-receptors, (iv) transendothelial migration mediated by b2-integrins, ICAM-1, PECAM-1, JAMs and CD99, and (v) the subsequent matrix migration mediated by integrins binding to proteins of the ECM. (b) Leukocyte L-selectin interacts with glycoprotein ligands such as CD34, GlyCAM-1, or endomucin. L-selectin-mediated interactions are important for lymphocyte interactions with high endothelial venules. By contrast, during neutrophil recruitment in an acute inflammatory response, P-selectin and E-selectin on endothelial cells interact with PSGL-1 and ESL-1 on neutrophils, respectively. The PSGL-1­P-selectin interaction is the earliest, as P-selectin is contained in Weibel-Palade bodies and translocates to the luminal endothelial cell surface following pro-inflammatory stimulation. Staphylococcal SSL-5 interacts specifically with PSGL-1, thereby blocking the PSGL-1­P-selectin-mediated rolling of neutrophils. (c) Chemokines and chemoattractants regulate leukocyte recruitment interactions in two ways: (i) chemokines such as IL-8, bound to the luminal endothelial surface, interact with rolling leukocytes, eliciting a rapid integrin activation, and (ii) chemoattractants present at the infection site provide guidance during transendothelial migration and migration within the infected tissue. Such chemoattractants are either released by the bacteria, or are generated as a result of bacterial invasion and are recognized by their cognate receptors on neutrophils. The complement component C5a or formylated peptides released from bacteria stimulate neutrophils via the receptors C5aR and FPR, respectively. Both interactions can be blocked by staphylococcal CHIPS that binds to C5aR and FPR and thereby competes with the physiological ligand. In addition, staphylococcal FLIPr inhibits the interaction of the FPRL1 with its endogenous ligands that include isoforms of amyloid or prions. These staphylococcal factors thereby prevent neutrophil chemotaxis. (d) Firm adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells is mediated by the interactions of the b2-integrins Mac-1 and LFA-1, which interact with the endothelial counter-receptor ICAM-1 or by the interaction of the leukocyte b1-integrin VLA-4, which binds to endothelial VCAM-1. While integrins are present on the leukocyte surface and become rapidly activated by chemokines, the expression of the endothelial counterreceptors ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The subsequent transendothelial migration of leukocytes depends on both heterophilic and homophilic interactions: the heterophilic LFA-1­ICAM-1 interaction, the heterophilic interactions between the b2-integrin family members LFA-1 and Mac-1 with their counter-receptors of the JAM-family, and homophilic interactions between CD99 and PECAM-1. CD99 and PECAM-1 are present on both the leukocyte surface and the interendothelial junctions. S. aureus-derived Eap binds to ICAM-1, thereby interfering with both Mac-1- and LFA-1-dependent adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells in addition to LFA-1­ICAM-1-mediated transmigration of neutrophils through the endothelial cell layer.

which is rapidly translocated from specific storage granules, the Weibel-Palade bodies, to the luminal endothelial cell surface following proinflammatory stimulation [40]. Firm adhesion of leukocytes onto endothelial cells is mediated by leukocyte b2-integrins Mac-1 (also known as

CD11b/CD18, aMb2-integrin) and lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) (also known as CD11a/CD18, aLb2integrin) in addition to the b1-integrin VLA-4 (also known as CD49d/CD29, a4b1-integrin). Their endothelial counterreceptors include intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and -2

(ICAM-1, ICAM-2) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) [41]. These adhesive interactions are extended during subsequent leukocyte transendothelial migration (designated as diapedesis) and include heterophilic interactions between Mac-1, LFA-1 and their counter-receptors ICAM-1 or members of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family, in addition to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1)- or CD99-mediated homophilic interactions [42,43] (Figure 1d). Leukocyte infiltration to the infection site also requires the migration of leukocytes through the subendothelial ECM which is guided by integrin-dependent adhesive interactions of leukocytes with matrix proteins, such as fibrinogen and fibrin, fibronectin, and collagen and facilitated by pericellular proteolysis [41]. Chemokines and chemoattractants regulate leukocyte recruitment interactions in two ways. (i) Chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), which are fixed to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the luminal endothelial surface, can be recognized by their cognate receptors on rolling leukocytes eliciting rapid integrin activation [44], and (ii) chemoattractants present at the infection site provide guidance during transendothelial migration and migration of leukocytes within the infected tissue [45]. These chemoattractants are either released by the bacteria (such as formylated peptides, e.g. fMet-Leu-Phe, that interact with the `formylated peptide receptor', FPR), are generated as a result of bacterial invasion and complement activation (such as C5a that binds to the C5a receptor), or are generated as a result of the bacteria-induced leukocyte activation (such as IL-8, which acts on the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2). These chemokine receptors belong to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane, heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors [46]. Inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment by S. aureus components The hallmark of S. aureus infection is neutrophil recruitment and pus formation. Leukocyte accumulation is triggered by formylated peptides and by further proinflammatory factors such as the phenol-soluble modulin peptides, including the delta-toxin [47,48]. However, under some circumstances, the recruitment of too many or too few neutrophils can be deleterious to the host [49,50]. In addition, S. aureus contains an impressive arsenal of anti-adhesive and anti-migratory proteins that specifically interfere with every step of host inflammatory cell recruitment. Thus, the tight modulation of leukocyte recruitment by S. aureus is important for bacterial virulence. Here, we will focus on S. aureus-derived factors that interfere with inflammatory cell recruitment. With regard to selectin-mediated cell­cell interactions, the bacterial SSL-5 polypeptide was demonstrated to interact directly with PSGL-1, thereby interfering with leukocyte rolling [51]. The affinity of SSL-5 for PSGL-1 was of the same order of magnitude as P-selectin for PSGL-1, and SSL-5 binding to PSGL-1 resembled the P-selectin­PSGL1-interaction in that it displayed similar requirements for tyrosine sulfation and proper glycosylation of PSGL-1. SSL-5 binding to neutrophils inhibited their rolling along endothelial cells [51] (Figure 1b). Whether SSL-5 can also

impair neutrophil extravasation to infected or inflamed sites in vivo remains to be established. A major anti-adhesive protein of S. aureus is the SERAM Eap [previously designated Map (MHC class II analogous protein)], present in 97% of clinical isolates, a highly cationic protein with a variable molecular mass (60­ 70 kDa) as it is composed of 4­6 homologous domains of 100 amino acid residues each [52]. Eap expression is tightly regulated through sae, a staphylococcal global regulator [53]. As a secreted protein, Eap can rebind to the bacterial surface [54]; however, the respective binding sites on the bacterial surface are not unequivocally characterized. Eap has a propensity to multimerize [55] and has a broad spectrum of binding interactions to host adhesive proteins such as vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen or osteopontin [56,57]. However the importance of Eap in bacterial tissue colonization is not yet established. We recently showed that Eap specifically interacts with endothelial ICAM-1 [58], leading to inhibition of ICAM-1­ integrin interactions. Thus, Eap completely abolished the ICAM-1-dependent firm adhesion of neutrophils through Mac-1, LFA-1, as well as their transmigration through the endothelium [58,59] (Figure 1d). Moreover, Eap blocked neutrophil adhesion to fibrinogen [58]. Consequently, isolated Eap blocked b2-integrin-dependent neutrophil recruitment into the inflamed peritoneum in mice by 80%, and in bacterial peritonitis, neutrophil recruitment was significantly lower when an Eap-positive strain was engaged as compared with isogenic Eap-deficient S. aureus [58]. These observations lead us to propose that Eap contributes to the pathogenesis of impaired wound healing frequently seen in chronically S. aureus-infected wounds or ulcera [60]. As established by experiments in mice engaging isolated Eap or Eap-positive versus isogenic Eapdeficient strains, the protein was found to cause delayed wound closure [61]. This was associated with reduced

Box 1. Therapeutic implications of staphylococcal inhibitors of inflammatory cell recruitment
The anti-adhesive and anti-migratory factors of S. aureus that can specifically interfere with every step of inflammatory cell recruitment can provide the platform for designing novel therapeutic modalities to target leukocyte­endothelial interactions in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Selectins, integrins, their immunoglobulin superfamily counter-receptors and chemokine receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of inflammation [41,80]. Targeting the C5aR by CHIPS could prove useful in ischemiareperfusion injury or in sepsis [75,76]. SSL-5-based compounds might be used therapeutically in pathologies involving the PSGL-1­ P-selectin interaction, such as asthma, psoriasis, ischemia-reperfusion injury and stroke [80]. Moreover, Eap is a very potent ICAM-1inhibitor [58]. ICAM-1 antagonism is considered a promising strategy in psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [80]. The therapeutic potential of the S. aureus-derived inhibitors needs to be addressed in experimental studies in animal models of inflammation. In such an effort, we recently demonstrated that Eap had excellent therapeutic efficacy in the mouse model of EAE, the counterpart of human multiple sclerosis. Eap administration not only prevented the development of the disease but also ameliorated the disease and reversed paralysis of the mice after the onset of the disease [65]. The attractive therapeutic applications of S. aureus-derived factors will be a growing field of investigation in the future.

infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into wound sites, and Eap provoked impaired leukocyte activation as evidenced by reduced nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activation and tissue factor expression. Moreover, revascularization of wounds (repair angiogenesis) was inhibited by Eap as well, reflected by Eap-mediated impairment of endothelial functions, such as proliferation and migration, and by

inhibition of growth factor-dependent stimulation of the Ras­Raf­MEK­ERK signaling cascade in endothelial cells [61,62]. An anti-inflammatory role for Eap was demonstrated by its inhibition of T cell proliferation and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, thereby affecting the course of chronic infections observed in persistent abscesses and

Figure 2. Structural similarity between staphylococcal anti-inflammatory factors. (a) Superantigens comprise two structurally distinct domains: the b-barrel N-terminal domain that interacts with MHC class II, and the C-terminal domain that adopts a b-grasp motif and binds to the T cell receptor. A representative structure of the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) from S. aureus is shown. The N-terminal, oligonucleotide- and oligosaccharide-binding domain is depicted in gray; the C-terminal b-grasp domain is composed of a-helix (green), b-sheet (blue) and 310-helix (purple) [79]. (b) The structure of an individual Eap domain is shown. The Eap domain structure consists primarily of a four-turn a-helix (green) lying diagonally across a five-stranded, mixed b-sheet (blue); the 310-helix is shown in purple [79]. Thus, the Eap structure shares significant structural homology with the C-terminus of staphylococcal superantigens, such as TSST-1 and SEB (Staphylococcus enterotoxin B) [79]. This is demonstrated in panel (c), in which the Ca backbone traces of EAP (purple) and the C-terminal domain of TSST-1 (green) were superimposed [79]. (d) Interestingly, the CHIPS fragment consisting of residues 31­121 has a similar structure comprising an N-terminal a-helix (red) packed onto a four-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet (yellow). (e) Structural alignment of CHIPS31­121 (blue) with the C-terminal domain of SSL-5 (red) [73]. SSL proteins are two-domain proteins with a structure characteristic to the superantigen family [32]. CHIPS31­121 shows a high degree of structural homology with the C-terminus of SSL-5 and SSL-7, and, to a lesser extent, with TSST-1 [73]. Thus, Eap and CHIPS are structurally related to the large family of superantigen and superantigen-like proteins. Whereas Eap contains all structural components of the C-terminal b-grasp domain of superantigens, CHIPS31­121 contains one more anti-parallel b-strand at its C-terminus (b4) and lacks the N-terminal b1, b2 and b3-strands of the Eap domain. The structural similarity of Eap and CHIPS with the C-terminus of superantigens is striking if one takes into account that no amino acid sequence homology between these proteins is detected [73,79]. In addition, Eap, CHIPS and SSL-5 share the propensity to interfere with leukocyte recruitment, whereas superantigens or other SSL-family members interfere with other components of the immune response. Eap, CHIPS, superantigens and SSL proteins adopt a b-grasp fold, which allows them to have a wide repertoire of protein­protein interactions. The observation that such functionally related molecules with little or no sequence homology share common structural elements is indicative of convergent evolution of these factors.

chronic arthritis or osteomyelitis [63]. By contrast, Eap was dispensable during renal abscess formation [58]. Thus, it is not yet entirely clear in which infection processes Eap is involved as a virulence factor. Nevertheless the role of Eap in bacterial virulence is separable from its potential to serve as a novel therapeutic anti-inflammatory agent. In particular, Eap blocked ICAM-1-dependent adhesive interactions of T cells, and thereby prevented the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse counterpart of human multiple sclerosis, a devastating autoimmune disorder with high lethality. Strikingly, intervention with Eap after the onset of EAE effectively suppressed the pathological outcome and reversed the clinical symptoms almost completely [64]. Taken together, our findings indicate that Eap could represent an attractive treatment modality against autoimmune neuro-inflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (Box 1). Given the importance of ICAM-1 in T cell responses [65] and in the pathogenesis of S. aureusmediated diseases [66], it needs to be evaluated whether the interaction of Eap with ICAM-1 provides a common denominator for the diverse inhibitory effects of the bacterial protein. Interference with chemokine receptors and chemotaxis is an established strategy of several microorganisms, such as Bordetella pertussis or Cryptococcus neoformans [67,68] to evade the host defense systems. At least three different ways of inhibiting phagocyte recruitment in response to chemoattractants by S. aureus have been identified. First, the superantigens, staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B, can mediate a rapid downmodulation of chemokine receptors, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, in monocytes, resulting in a hyporesponsiveness of monocytes to the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a, MIP-1b and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. This mechanism involves the interaction of the superantigens with MHC class II and the proteolytic cleavage of the chemokine receptors by secreted serine proteases [69]. Second, the best characterized anti-chemotactic factor of S. aureus is the 14 kD secreted chemotaxis inhibitory protein of S. aureus (CHIPS) present in 60% of the S. aureus strains. CHIPS was identified to bind specifically to the C5a receptor (C5aR) and FPR on neutrophils and to compete with binding of their ligands, C5a and fMet-LeuPhe (fMLP), respectively (Figure 1c). CHIPS thereby inhibited C5a- and fMLP-induced calcium mobilization and neutrophil chemotaxis. By contrast, CHIPS did not affect IL-8-induced neutrophil responses. In vivo, purified CHIPS administered to mice impaired neutrophil recruitment towards C5a in a mouse peritonitis model [70]. The role of CHIPS in bacterial infection is unclear, as no data have been generated yet with CHIPS-positive and isogenic CHIPS-negative strains in animal models of infection. The KD values of CHIPS for the C5aR and FPR are in the low nM range [70,71]. The inhibitory activity on FPR relies within the N-terminal six amino acids of CHIPS, and particularly, the first and third phenylalanine residues therein are essential for CHIPS binding to FPR [72]. By contrast, a CHIPS fragment consisting of residues 31­121 is responsible for binding to and blocking of the C5aR, whereas it lacks FPR antagonism [73]. Mutation analysis
www.sciencedirect.com

of the C5aR revealed that the amino acids 10­18 within the N-terminus of the receptor contain the binding site for CHIPS [74]. Given the importance of C5a and C5aR in adult respiratory distress syndrome and in ischemia or reperfusion injury [75,76], a therapeutic implication for CHIPS can be envisioned (Box 1). Third, the secretable FPR-like 1 inhibitory protein (FLIPr) was recently described, which is prevalent in 59% of S. aureus strains and shares a 28% sequence homology with CHIPS. FLIPr binds to the FPR-like 1 receptor (FPRL1), a homolog of FPR expressed on neutrophils, and with lower affinity to FPR itself [77]. FPRL1 mediates binding of and signaling through several endogenous ligands, including fMLP, serum amyloid A, the 42 amino acid form of b-amyloid or the prion protein fragment PrP106­126 [78], and is thereby implicated in systemic amyloidosis, Alzheimer's and prion diseases. The bacterial FLIPr thereby acts in an anti-inflammatory fashion by inhibiting neutrophil responses and neutrophil chemotaxis to endogenous and also synthetic FPRL1 ligands [77]. Whether FLIPr might become a versatile antagonist for neurodegenerative disorders remains to be analyzed. Interestingly, the S. aureus-derived factors interfering with inflammatory cell recruitment, such as SSL-5, Eap and CHIPS, have structural similarity to the C-terminus of superantigens and superantigen-like proteins, as they adopt a b-grasp fold similar to the C-terminus of superantigens or SSL proteins. [73,79]. This similarity is striking if one takes into account the absence of amino acid homology between these anti-inflammatory factors [73]. Thus, it seems that the b-grasp fold motif, which is ideal for promoting a wide repertoire of protein­protein interactions, is the common denominator amongst immunoevasive factors derived from S. aureus (Figure 2). This is probably the result of convergent evolution amongst these functionally related factors. Conclusions and future directions In recent years, an impressive array of specific factors of S. aureus has been identified and characterized in their functions to subvert the innate immune response. We focused here on S. aureus-expressed anti-adhesive and anti-migratory proteins that specifically interfere with rolling, adhesion or chemotaxis, that is, with every step of inflammatory cell recruitment. We expect this group of anti-inflammatory factors of S. aureus to grow in the near future. Understanding the mechanisms of subversion of the immune response by S. aureus will not only lead to new insights into the pathophysiology of infection and to new antimicrobial strategies, but could also provide the platform for the design of new therapies in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders (Box 1).
