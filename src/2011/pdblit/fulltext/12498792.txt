The crystal structure of Bacillus stearothermophilus PhoE (originally termed YhfR), a broad speci®city monomeric phosphatase with a molecular mass Ê of $24 kDa, has been solved at 2.3 A resolution in order to investigate its structure and function. PhoE, already identi®ed as a homolog of a cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase, shares with the latter an a/b/a sandwich structure spanning, as a structural excursion, a smaller subdomain composed of two a-helices and one short b-strand. The active site contains residues from both the a/b/a sandwich and the sub-domain. With the exception of the hydrophilic catalytic machinery conserved throughout the cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase family, the active-site cleft is strikingly hydrophobic. Docking studies with two diverse, favored substrates show that 3-phosphoglycerate may bind to the catalytic core, while a-napthylphosphate binding also involves the hydrophobic portion of the active-site cleft. Combining a highly favorable phospho group binding site common to these substrate binding modes and data from related enzymes, a catalytic mechanism can be proposed that involves formation of a phosphohistidine intermediate on His10 and likely acid-base behavior of Glu83. Other structural factors contributing to the broad substrate speci®city of PhoE can be identi®ed. The dynamic independence of the subdomain may enable the active-site cleft to accommodate substrates of different sizes, although similar motions are present in simulations of cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases, perhaps favoring a more general functional role. A signi®cant number of entries in protein sequence databases, particularly from un®nished microbial genomes, are more similar to PhoE than to cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases or to fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases. This PhoE structure will therefore serve as a valuable basis for inference of structural and functional characteristics of these proteins.

Phosphoglycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.1; PGM) catalyses the interconversion of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA) and 2-phosphoglyceric acid (2PGA) in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Two different kinds of PGM have been characterized, one dependent on the cofactor 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (BPG) for activity (dPGMs) and the other independent (iPGMs). There is no sequence or structural similarity between the two types of PGM and their

1130 mechanisms of catalysis are different.1 The monomeric iPGMs of around 60 kDa are found predominantly in plants and some bacteria, in particular Gram-positive organisms, while the largely oligomeric dPGMs of around 25 kDa per monomer are found predominantly in animals and fungi but are present in some bacteria, mostly Gram-negative.1 Some bacteria such as Escherichia coli possess both dPGM and iPGM activity, with the former apparently predominating.2 In contrast, Bacillus species contain only iPGM activity.3 Both classes of PGMs are members of larger enzyme families. iPGMs show sequence and structural similarity with the alkaline phosphatase superfamily of enzymes.4,5 This superfamily includes enzymes such as alkaline phosphatases, sulfatases, alkaline phosphodiesterases/nucleotide pyrophosphates, phosphopentomutase, phosphonate monoesterases, and GPI-anchoring enzymes.5 iPGMs utilize a phosphoserine intermediate in their catalysis and at least some of them, if not all, are manganese or magnesium-dependent binuclear metalloenzymes. Structural relatives of dPGMs are similarly varied in their enzymatic activity. In the SCOP database,6 dPGMs and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (F26BPases) are grouped at the ``family'' level. Sequence and structural comparisons show that they share a set of conserved residues, forming a catalytic core, but otherwise exhibit many differences associated with their different substrate speci®cities and catalytic activities.7 ± 9 At the heart of the catalytic core is a histidine residue, which is transiently phosphorylated during the reaction.10,11 More distant relatives grouped at the superfamily level in SCOP, the acid phosphatases and phytases, were recognized only after structure determination12 due to very low sequence similarity with dPGMs and F26BPases. They share with the dPGMs/F26BPases two histidine and two arginine residues in the catalytic core1 and mechanisms involving a phosphohistidine intermediate,13 but differ in the remainder of the catalytic site. A new member, the Bacillus stearothermophilus yhfR gene monomeric product with a molecular mass of $24 kDa, has recently been added to this latter family. YhfR was originally assumed to be a dPGM, but exhibited no PGM activity14 and was later, with the bene®t of predictions derived from comparative model building, shown to possess broad speci®city phosphatase activity.15 Remarkably, YhfR was equally and highly active against such diverse substrates as 3-phosphoglycerate and a-napthylphosphate. As a consequence of these analyses, which indicate that YhfR is a broad speci®city phosphatase, we have renamed the yhfR gene phoE, as an additional gene encoding a broad speci®city phosphatase in Bacillus species, since other genes encoding broad speci®city phosphatases in Bacillus subtilis have been designated pho.16 The phoE gene product is also now termed PhoE. In order to better understand PhoE's broad substrate speci®city and to analyze the evolutionary relationship between PhoE and other members of

the family we have determined the crystal strucÊ ture of B. stearothermophilus PhoE at 2.3 A resolution. Our results suggest possible modes of substrate binding and highlight several probable contributors to the broad substrate speci®city of PhoE. The new structure should provide a better basis for the understanding of the roles of the numerous similar sequences emerging from microbial genomic sequencing projects.

Results and Discussion
Structure solution and refinement Initial efforts, using a wide variety of programs (see Materials and Methods), to solve the molecular replacement problem using either the yeast dPGM or rat testis F26BPase crystal structures, or a homology-built model15 failed. The correct solution was obtained only by using the NMR option of MOLREP17 and a combination of all three structures. The correct solution was the top translation solution for the 13th ranked rotation function peak. All three of the output parameters, density/s, R-factor, and correlation coef®cient, highlighted the correct solution. The density/s value of the correct solution was 9.60 compared with 7.73 for the highest-scoring incorrect solution. The corresponding values of R-factor and correlation coef®cient were 0.630 (0.640) and 0.260 (0.226). No packing con¯icts were detected. Remarkably, subsequent tests showed that no pair of structures was suf®cient to produce a correct solution. Hence, each individual structure contributed important similarities to the actual PhoE structure or, perhaps, aided in the elimination of incorrect solutions via MOLREP's packing function. Rigid body and positional re®nement was carried out for the correspondingly positioned homology model, the dPGM crystal structure and the F26BPase crystal structure. The resulting R and Rfree values were, respectively, 49.5 % and 53.3 % for the model, 55.3 % and 54.8 % for the dPGM and 52.0 % and 54.3 % for the F26BPase. The re®ned model having the lowest R-factors was, therefore, used as the basis for further crystallographic re®nement. This subsequent re®nement was helped signi®cantly by the use of torsion angle simulated annealing in combination with maximum likelihood re®nement targets and cross-validation.18,19 Solvent ¯attening was employed and yielded some dramatic improvements in map quality and interpretability. As re®nement progressed, large regions of difference map density were convincingly modeled as ®ve sulfate ions and three glycerol molecules. The sulfate ions were present in the crystallization solution, while glycerol presumably bound during the cryoprotectant soak. Only 33 water molecules could be located during the ®nal stages of re®nement.

1131 coef®cients are in the ranges 0.83-0.90 (glycerol) and 0.92-0.98 (sulfate) for the ®nal s-A-weighted j2Fo À Fcj map. Even the sulfate ions with the highest B-factors are associated with clear, tetrahedral electron density (Figure 3(a)). Each of these ligands is suitably positioned to form multiple hydrogen bonds to other parts of the model (Table 3). Based on comparisons with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae dPGM and rat F26Bpase structures, and our earlier modeling studies,15 the active-site cleft of PhoE was identi®ed and it contains residues from both the a/b/a sandwich and the subdomain. It is a deep, wide cleft lined predominantly with hydrophobic residues (Figure 2; see below). Two glycerol residues are located within the active-site cleft (Figures 2 and 3(b)), while the third is positioned at an interface with a crystallographic symmetryrelated molecule. Two of the sulfate ions, sulfate 301 and sulfate 302, are located near a different interface with a symmetry-related molecule, perhaps explaining the obligatory presence of sulfate in the crystallization conditions. Density supported the modeling of two alternative conformations for ®ve residues; Arg34, Glu45, Arg98, Arg122 and Asp187. In each case, modeling of alternative conformations with occupancies of 0.5 gave similar Bfactors for the two conformations and no occupancy re®nement was attempted. A cis-peptide bond is present between residues Pro173 and Pro174, and is well de®ned in electron density maps (Figure 3(b)). The side-chain of Lys156 forms hydrogen bonds with the main-chain oxygen atoms of both Ser172 and Pro174, thereby conceivably stabilizing the unusual main-chain conformation. The ®nal R-factor is, perhaps, higher than expected, but con®dence in the model is increased by the low Rfree value and the small difference between conventional and free R-factors,21 as well as by the good real space correlation coef®cients observed for the model (Figure 1).22 The reasons for our inability to achieve lower R-factors may be related to those responsible for the high overall Bfactor. These reasons could include physiologically high ¯exibility of the structure of PhoE, or re¯ect increased crystal disorder on freezing,23 or even radiation damage of crystals during data collection that was starting to manifest itself towards the end of the data collection.24,25 Use of these later frames was clearly justi®ed, however, by the known sensitivity of success in molecular replacement on the completeness of the dataset.26 Structural comparisons Our earlier sequence comparison studies had already shown a clear relationship of PhoE with dPGMs and F26Bpases.15 As Figure 2 shows, PhoE shares with these enzymes a six-stranded, mixed bsheet ¯anked by a-helices. A further two helices (numbers 4 and 5) along with strand E form an excursion from this structural unit, which is bound to the main body of the structure through a short

Description of the final model The data in Tables 1 and 2 show a well-re®ned structure with excellent sterochemistry. In a Ramachandran plot,20 89.2 % of residues are located in the most-favored areas and none in the disallowed or generously allowed areas. This crystal structure Ê was solved at 2.3 A and contains residues Ala2 to Glu203 of this 23,732 Da enzyme. No density was seen of the N-terminal methionine residue, undoubtedly re¯ecting prior cleavage as seen with B. subtilis YhfR,14 nor for ®ve C-terminal residues. Ê Despite a high overall B-factor of 54 A2, electron density is very clear for the entire structure with the exception of the very C terminus at which disorder is evident in elevated B-factors and poorer real space correlation coef®cients (Figure 1). The bulk of the structure comprises an a/b/a sandwich built from a central six-stranded mixed b-sheet, A, F, C, D, G, and H, ¯anked on both sides by ahelices, numbers 2 and 3 on one side and helices 6 and 7 on the other side (Figure 2). An additional helix, 1, and b-strand, B, extend towards a subdomain comprising two a-helices, 4 and 5, and a short b-strand, E. Strands B and E form a short parallel b-sheet. There are three glycerol molecules and ®ve sulfate ions located in the model. The Bfactors for the ligand molecules are in the ranges Ê Ê 67-87 A2 for glycerol and 78-124 A2 for sulfate residues.

1133 tantly related acid phosphatases and phytases,32,33 were visualized in a tree representation (Figure 5). This tree illustrates how the two major branches contain both broad phosphatases and narrow mutases or phosphatases. Despite sharing with the well-characterized acid phosphatases a broad substrate speci®city, PhoE clearly has a different evolutionary history. The temperature optimum of B. stearothermophilus broad speci®city phosphatase PhoE is around 65  C,15 re¯ecting the thermophilic nature of B. stearothermophilus. Recent studies have sought trends in sequence and structural characteristics of thermophilic proteins34,35 with some contradictory results. However, there seems to be clear enrichment of thermophilic proteins with branched-chain hydrophobic and charged residues, and a depletion of thermolabile residues (Cys, Met, Asn and Gln), compared to mesophilic homologs, as well as a trend towards shorter surface loops in the former class.36 The sequence and structure of B. stearothermophilus PhoE, compared to those of the dPGMs from S. cerevisiae and Sch. pombe and the rat F26BPase domain (Figure 4) show no sign of conforming to these trends. By each of the amino acid composition criteria, B. stearothermophilus PhoE resembles the mesophilic enzymes; it has 22 % branched hydrophobic residues (23-24 % in the dPGMs and F26BPase domain), 32 % charged residues (30 %) and 8 % thermolabile residues (8-13 %). Similarly, examination of Figure 4 suggests no obvious shortening of surface loops in the thermophilic structure. The active site A key interest in the determination of the structure of PhoE lay in its possible explanations for its broad speci®city phosphatase activity in contrast to the highly speci®c activities seen for the nearest structural neighbors dPGM and F26BPase. Among the tested substrates, the highest PhoE speci®c activity was observed for 3-phosphoglycerate and a-napthylphosphate (27 and 21 mmol/min per mg of protein, respectively), the former medium-sized and hydrophilic, the latter much larger and hydrophobic. The binding mode of 3-phosphoglycerate to S. cerevisiae dPGM observed experimentally,27 albeit at low occupancy, cannot be adopted by PhoE, in which Asn16 and Gln22 would both lead to steric clashes with the ligand. Instead, the nearer of the two glycerol molecules fortuitously bound in the active site was used as a guide to the possible mode of binding of 3-phosphoglycerate. Signi®cant movement was required away from the binding location of the glycerol molecule in order to accommodate the phospho group but an apparently favorable binding mode could be obtained (Figure 6(a)). In this mode, the phospho group is extensively hydrogen bonded by His10, Arg59, Asn16 and Gln22. The carboxylic acid group, and possibly the 2-hydroxyl group, interact favorably

fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase for F26BPase) lie in the absence in PhoE of the long C-terminal region in F26BPase which overlies the active site, and the lack of a region corresponding to S. cerevisiae dPGM residues 123-147 in F26BPase. These latter residues are also lacking from the dPGM from Sch. pombe30 and hence are not essential for dPGM activity. As the boxes in Figure 4 show, PhoE bears a slightly closer structural resemblance to dPGM than to F26BPase. Structural alignment of PhoE with S. cerevisiae dPGM matched 154 Ca atoms Ê with an rms deviation of 1.4 A, while with rat PFK-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PDB code 1bif) 137 Ca atoms were aligned with an rms deviation Ê of 1.5 A. Alignment with Sch. pombe dPGM (PDB code 1fzt; NMR model 21, de®ned as the most representative) matched 129 Ca atoms with an rms Ê deviation of 1.6 A.

1135 served catalytic core, while a-napthylphosphate in addition binds to the other side of the active-site cleft which, in stark contrast to dPGMs and F26BPases, is of an almost entirely hydrophobic nature. Two further general features of the PhoE structure, both predicted by modeling15 and supported by the X-ray crystal structure may contribute to its broad speci®city and its lesser, although still signi®cant, activity towards even larger substrates such as AMP.15 Compared with the narrowly speci®c dPGMs and F26BPases, the active-site cleft is broader and more open. Several backbone differences contribute to this. First, even with the nonappearance of the C-terminal ®ve residues of PhoE in the electron density map, it is clear that the Cterminal region of PhoE does not lie over the active-site cleft as it does in dPGMs and, particularly, in F26BPases. The second difference lies in the largest stretch of residues that cannot be structurally aligned with existing structures (Figure 4); positions 98-122, comprising most of the small excursion from the main a/b/a structure (Figure 2). In this region, the PhoE main chain is further from the catalytic residues than the corresponding region of dPGMs, giving a larger, more open pocket. In F26BPases, this region resembles PhoE more than it does dPGMs, but residues from the C-terminal extension present in neither of the other structures (Figure 4) lie against it, yielding a narrow, closed pocket. Thirdly, the insertion of Pro174 compared to the other structures, preceded by a hitherto unseen cis-peptide bond, leads to an abrupt diversion in the otherwise extended main chain of the region that forms the lip of the pocket on one side (Figure 3(b)). The second general feature possibly aiding broad speci®city is the low electrostatic charge of the PhoE pocket compared to those of dPGMs and F26BPases. As ®rst suggested by the comparison of narrowly speci®c Aspergillus ®cuum phytase32 and broadly speci®c Aspergillus niger acid phosphatase,33 the more neutral electrostatic ®eld of PhoE may place fewer constraints on the substrate's charge distribution, thereby broadening substrate speci®city. As predicted by modeling,15 PhoE shares the conserved catalytic core found in dPGMs and F26BPases with side-chains adopting conformations very similar to those seen in structures of dPGMs and F26BPases. A catalytic mechanism may therefore be proposed, based on results from these homologous enzymes. Substrate would initially bind with its phospho group favorably hydrogen bonded by His10, Arg59, Asn16 and Gln22. (Figures 3 and 6). The phosphohistidine intermediate would result from the nucleophilic attack of His10 on the phospho group, with accompanying transfer of a proton from Glu83 to the dephosphorylated product. This proton transfer might be direct, as proposed for F26BPases,8 or water-mediated, as suggested for dPGMs.7 The position of the suggestively positioned water molecule in S. cerevisiae dPGM7 is occupied by a gly-

with Arg9. The greater number of interactions of the enzyme with the phospho group compared to the rest of the substrate would be in line with its broad speci®city. Gln22 replaces the smaller corresponding Thr and Gly residues in dPGMs and F26BPases, and may be an adaptation in a nonspeci®c phosphatase for the optimal positioning of the substrate's phospho group for catalysis. This would not be necessary in the speci®c F26BPases, since the substrate's orientation in those cases is well de®ned by multiple hydrogen bonding and other interactions.8 Another hint that Gln22 might Ê play an important role lies in the 2.7 A hydrogen bond made between its side-chain oxygen atom and the side-chain of Ser27, which is largely buried. This interaction seems well-positioned to tether the Gln22 side-chain in its crystallograhically observed position where it putatively interacts with the phospho group. In the S. cerevisiae dPGM and rat testis F26BPase structures, the corresponding residue is valine or proline, respectively. A further attractive feature of this putative substrate binding mode is the relative proximity of the phosÊ pho group to Glu83 (around 3.2 A). This might help induce the protonation of this residue in readiness for its probable role as proton donor during reaction7 (see below). Binding of larger substrates will necessarily involve residues further from the catalytic core, and it is in the remainder of the active site that PhoE exhibits the most striking differences when compared with dPGMs and F26BPases. In dPGMs and F26BPases, the remainder of the active-site cleft contains mainly hydrophilic residues, including many basic residues, which are conserved within each family, and are involved in speci®c substrate binding.7,8 PhoE is very different. With the exception of two further hydrophilic residues, Lys156 and Gln22 , the active-site cleft is lined entirely by hydrophobic residues; Met21, Ile85, Leu86, Phe108, Trp109, Phe123, Val153 and Trp171 (see Figure 2). Even the side-chain of Lys156 is turned back on itself so that it forms hydrogen bonds to the main-chain oxygen atoms of Ser172 and Pro174, hence exposing the hydrophobic portion of its side-chain to the pocket. Using the same favorable phosphate binding site located above, a-napthylphosphate was docked into the pocket manually (Figure 6(b)). An explanation for the high speci®c activity of PhoE towards this substrate then became immediately apparent, as the napthyl group is well-sized to interact with many of the hydrophobic residues lining the pockets. Predicted hydrophobic interactions are made with Ê Ê Ê Met21 (3.4 A), Trp109 (3.3 A), Val153 (3.9 A), Ê Ê Leu86 (3.9 A) and Phe108 (3.6 A) (Figure 6(b)). Comparison of the predicted binding modes of 3-phosphoglycerate and a-napthylphosphate (Figure 6) reveals the essence of the structural basis of the ability of PhoE to work ef®ciently with both. Sharing the same highly favorable phosphate binding site, binding of 3-phosphoglycerate exploits the positively charged, hydrophilic nature of the con-

cerol molecule in the present structure. Formation of the catalytically active, protonated form of Glu83 would be promoted by the proximity of the substrate's phospho group (Figure 3). The phosphohistidine intermediate would be stabilized through hydrogen bonding interactions with Arg8, Asn16 and Arg59. Dephosphorylation of this intermediate would be accomplished through a water-mediated nucleophilic attack of the nowdeprotonated Glu83. Simulated dynamics The relatively small number of contacts made by the a/b/a excursion from positions 85-121 (Figures 2 and 4) suggested that it might have a degree of dynamic independence from the main a/ b/a structural unit. Since this sub-domain contains residues contributing to the lining of the active site (Figures 2, 5 and 6), this seemed to offer a further possible source of broad substrate speci®city; the active site could alter its volume through the motion of this ¯exible part of the structure and hence accommodate substrates of different sizes (as seen, for example, in some serine proteases). In order to check this hypothesis, computational analyses were performed. CONCOORD was used to rapidly generate ``trajectories'' containing ensembles of computed conformations, these qualitatively reproducing the motions derived from rigorous molecular dynamics studies.37 Essential dynamics (ED) analysis38 was used to extract the most signi®cant concerted motions in the system.39,40 In addition to B. stearothermophilus broad speci-

Eigenvectors describe the covarying motions of sets of residues with eigenvalues re¯ecting their magnitudes. Visual analysis showed that the motions described by the top three eigenvectors were similar for the two proteins. Quantitative analysis with DynDom41 con®rmed this result. With the exception of a few small differences, the dynamic domains and hinge regions de®ned by DynDom were near-identical between Sch. pombe dPGM and B. stearothermophilus PhoE for all three top eigenvectors (data not shown). This shows that dynamic properties of

1138 PhoE seem unlikely to contribute to its broad substrate speci®city, since the narrowly speci®c dPGM shares comparable motions. Nevertheless, the dynamic independence of the a/b/a excursion was dramatically obvious. For all the top three eigenvectors, 37-44 residues in the range 82-125 plus four to ten residues in the range 13-24, formed a dynamic domain. These stretches correspond to helices 4 and 5, and strand E, comprising the structural excursion from the a/b/a unit, along with strand B (see Figures 2 and 4). Eigenvector 1, for example, describes an opening and closing motion of this dynamic domain relative to the rest of the structure. Figure 7 shows a superposition of the maximum and minimum projections for eigenvector 1 of the PhoE simulations. The large amplitude of the motion is clear. For example, the interatomic Ca distance between residues 93 (in the structural excursion) and 170 (on Ê the opposite side of the active-site cleft) is 20.6 A Ê in the maximum projection and 16.6 A for the minimum projection. For Sch. pombe dPGM, the Ê Ê corresponding distances are 28.8 A and 23.9 A, respectively. Experimental support for the presence of conformational ¯exibility in this portion of the molecule comes from the localized higher rms deviations among NMR models29 and higher than average B-factors in some crystal structures.42 The mobility of the a/b/a excursions described by eigenvector 1 could be of functional signi®cance in the dPGM family, since known or hypothetical substrate binding residues are found in this subdomain7,8 (Figures 2, 4 and 6). Examples abound in the literature of hinge-bending motions, revealed by ED analysis, likely to possess functional relevance.39,43,44

Crystal Structure of B. stearothermophilus PhoE

Additional relevance may be attached to these motions in the majority of dPGMs which, like the S. cerevisiae and E. coli enzymes, but unlike that of Sch. pombe, have a functionally important C-terminal tail.45 The structure of phosphorylated E. coli dPGM has suggested, in addition, that residues Arg113 and Arg114 (S. cerevisiae dPGM numbering; Figure 4) act as a switch to transduce the presence of substrate in the binding site into an ordering of the C-terminal tail. The ordering of the tail is aided by interaction with Glu106. Residues Arg113, Arg114, and Glu106 are all contained within the structural excursion. The possible functional importance of this and other motions in the dPGM family will be the subject of a more detailed study.

Sequence analysis In the era of the genome project, as the number of known protein sequences continues to outstrip the number of known protein structures, the use of known structures for comparative model building will inevitably grow in importance. Structural genomics projects aim to ®ll in the gaps in fold space to enable the construction of models for the largest possible number of sequences.46 Models derived in this way, even inevitably containing errors, can offer valuable clues to the function of the protein in question.47,48 The model of B. stearothermophilus PhoE15 is in good agreement with the crystal structure as shown by a mean displacement Ê of all Ca atoms after superposition of 1.82 A. A detailed comparison of the model and the structure will be the subject of a separate communication.

The isolated spheres mark the Ca positions of His10 in the two projections.

Crystal Structure of B. stearothermophilus PhoE

1139 de®ned functional class, but the number of related sequences in microbial genomes surely shows them to be worthy of further study. As the available structure sharing highest sequence similarity with most of them, PhoE will prove invaluable for their analysis. In both sets of sequences, examples can be found with exceedingly low levels of identity with any of the known structures of the dPGM family, although signi®cant BLAST scores and conservation of catalytic site motifs assures their homology. For example, a putative S. cerevisiae sequence with SwissProt entry name YNK8_YEAST bears 12, 9 and 12 % sequence identity with B. stearothermophilus PhoE, S. cerevisiae dPGM and rat testis F26BPase. Such ®gures strongly suggest that still further activities and/or sequence speci®cities exist in the dPGM family.

Database searches were therefore carried out in order to assess the possible contribution of the new PhoE structure in this context. Two sequence datasets were compared to the sequences of three representative structures (Figure 5); S. cerevisiae dPGM, rat testis F26BPase and B. stearothermophilus PhoE. The ®rst dataset was derived from a BLAST search in sequences emerging from un®nished microbial genome projects. The second was taken from the PGAM entry (PF00300) in the PFAM 6.4 database49 assembled from SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL sequences. Both were aligned and sequence relationships with the representative sequences were analyzed (Table 4). The sequences in the PFAM contain many sequences that clearly belong to either dPGM or F26BPase groups, since these have hitherto been the focus of most research. Nevertheless, a comparable number of sequences are more similar to PhoE, so that the structure presented here would represent the best template for construction of models and the improved functional understanding that would result. It is notable, however, that this set of sequences bears low pairwise identities with PhoE, so that they clearly do not represent a well-de®ned group in the same way as dPGMs and F26BPases. An interestingly different picture comes from analysis of sequences emerging from microbial genome projects. As expected from the general absence of F26BP metabolism in microbes, excepting trypanosomatids,50 F26BPase would be the best template for construction of models for few of these sequences. Between PhoE and dPGM, the structure presented here is more suitable in twice as many cases as dPGM structures (Table 4). Figure 8 shows that these emerging sequences can be divided into two groups; those readily identi®able as dPGMs (40 % identity and above with dPGM in Figure 8) and a group, generally with low similarity to either structure, but mainly more similar to PhoE than to dPGM. Again, there is no suggestion that PhoE is a member of a clearly

Conclusions
The structure of B. stearothermophilus PhoE adds a new member to the dPGM extended family. Some general characteristics of the active site may be shared with the similarly broad speci®city acid phosphatases but it is clear that they have in common only a very distant ancestor. Modeling of substrate binding suggests that the most rapidly hydrolyzed hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates have a common phospho-binding site in the catalytic core, with the latter type of substrate, in addition, involving the strikingly hydrophobic remainder of the active site. Sequence analysis shows that microbial genomes are rich in dPGM homologs more resembling PhoE than dPGM, and that the new structure should serve to better understand the function(s) of these proteins. Furthermore, the existence of sequences that are only very distantly related to known structures suggests that more novel activities or speci®cities remain to be discovered in this expanding family.

Crystal Structure of B. stearothermophilus PhoE Given the expected dif®culty of the molecular replacement, due to the limited sequence identity between PhoE and known crystal structures, several different programs, employing various methodologies were employed; MOLREP,17 COMO,54 Queen of Spades55 and CNS 1.0.56 Crystallographic re®nement proceeded in alternating rounds of computational re®nement and map calculation with CNS56 and manual model inspection and modi®cation with O.57 A free R-factor,58 calculated from 5 % of re¯ections set aside at the outset, was used to monitor the progress of re®nement and aid in the choice of B-factor re®nement protocol at different stages of re®nement.21 In this way, the initial anisotropic overall B-factor was replaced, successively, with per-residue Bfactors, separate per-residues B-factors for main-chain and side-chain atoms and ®nally, restrained individual atomic B-factors. The severe model bias present in the initial molecular replacement solution was tackled using a set of appropriate methodologies, including s-A weighted electron density maps,59 maximum likelihood re®nement targets,60 torsion angle simulated annealing18,19 and solvent ¯attening.61 All data from Ê 50.0-2.3 A were used throughout, without the application of s or amplitude-based cutoffs. A variety of stereochemical20 and other analyses57,62 were performed periodically in order to locate possible model errors. Coordinate, topology, and parameter ®les for these ligands were obtained from the HIC-UP database22 and carefully hand-corrected to re¯ect ideal stereochemical values. When the free R-value reached 27 %, water molecules were added in three cycles using programs of the CCP4 package.63 Water molecules were placed into 3s peaks in s-A weighted jFo À Fcj maps, where they were within suitable hydrogen bonding distance from the existing model. After re®nement, water molecules whose positions were not supported by electron density, at 1s contouring, in a s-A weighted j2Fo À Fcj map were deleted. Structure and sequence analysis Structural comparisons were made using LSQMAN,64 MAP31 and DALI.65 Programs of the PHYLIP package66 were used to construct a neighbor-joining tree representation of structural similarities from MAP-derived data. In the case of the NMR structure of Sch. pombe dPGM,29 the most representative model (number 21) was used for structural comparisons. Bobscript67 and MOLSCRIPT 268 were used to make structural Figures, while ALSCRIPT69 was used to format alignments. STRIDE70 was used for the de®nition of secondary structure elements in 3D structures with the exception of the NMR structure Sch. pombe dPGM, for which the authors' annotation was used. BLAST71 was used to search the un®nished genome database at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/ Microb_blast/un®nishedgenome.html. ClustalW72 and Jalview (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ $ michele/jalview/contents.html) were used for sequence alignment and manipulation respectively. Xmgrace (http://plasmagate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/) was used to plot graphs. 3Phosphoglycerate and a-napthylphosphate coordinates were generated with the aid of the HIC-UP database and manually docked into the ®nal model using program O. Dynamics simulations and analysis Trajectories containing 500 conformations were produced using the CONCOORD method37,73 for Sch. pombe

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and collection of X-ray diffraction data The B. stearothermophilus PhoE protein (expressed in E. coli strain PS3297) was cloned, overexpressed and puri®ed as described.15 The crystallization sample contained a homogenous PhoE protein (20 mg/ml) in 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl. Crystallization of B. stearothermophilus PhoE was accomplished using the vapor-diffusion, hanging-drop method in 24-well Linbro culture plates using equal volumes of the protein sample and the reservoir solution (1-2 ml of each) at 22  C.51,52 The protein and reservoir solution were mixed and equilibrated against 1.0 ml of reservoir solution. Diffraction-quality trigonal, bipyramidal blockshaped crystals of PhoE (0.6 mm Â 0.3 mm Â 0.3 mm) were grown using 45 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000), 120 mM lithium sulfate, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Native PhoE crystals were cryo-protected by soaking them brie¯y in a cryo-solution and ¯ash-freezing them at À170  C in a nitrogen ¯ow using a Cryostream Cooler (Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). The cryo-solution contained 30 % (w/v) glycerol, 200 mM ammonium sulfate, 39 % (w/v) PEG4000, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The native Ê crystals were diffracted using a 1.10 A synchrotron X-ray radiation at the 19-BM beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory, Advanced Photon Source, Structural Biology Center using an Oxford 3 Â 3 CCD detector. The diffraction data were processed with the HKL2000 package.53 Computational crystallographic methods Previous analysis had shown PhoE to be apparently equally similar to dPGMs and F26BPases.15 Both of these were, therefore, used as search models for molecular replacement attempts (PDB codes 5pgm and 1tip). In addition, a 3D model for B. stearothermophilus PhoE15 was used, since there is evidence that homology models may sometimes be useful for molecular replacement.

Crystal Structure of B. stearothermophilus PhoE dPGM (PDB code 1fzt; representative NMR model 21) and for PhoE. The CONCOORD program generates random protein structures ful®lling a set of upper and lower interatomic distance limits. These limits are derived from experimental structures through measurement of distances and prediction of interaction strength. Thus, the separation of strongly interacting atoms is allowed to vary from the observed value only slightly, while weaker interactions are accorded more relaxed limits. Special consideration is given to interacting atoms within the same secondary structure element in order to ensure the preservation of secondary structure. While detailed aspects of dynamic variation may not be reproduced by this method, good qualitative agreement has been found between results of conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and CONCOORD simulations.37 CONCOORD is particularly applicable to large systems, where conventional MD would require unfeasibly large amounts of computer time, and is ®nding an increasing number of applications.73 CONCOORD-generated conformations were treated as an MD trajectory37 and analyzed using the essential dynamics (ED) method.38 The central hypothesis of this method is that only the motions along the eigenvectors with large eigenvalues are important for describing the functionally signi®cant motions in the protein. The motions produced by ED analysis were analyzed visually using O and quantitatively using DynDom.41 This program is able to determine so-called dynamic domains through comparison of two conformations of the same protein. The minimum and the maximum projections of eigenvectors 1, 2 and 3 for each structure analyzed were compared. For each eigenvector, a wholeprotein best ®t of the two conformations was made followed by the determination of dynamic domains.
