Hookworms are hematophagous nematodes capable of growth, development and subsistence in living host systems such as humans and other mammals. Approximately one billion, or one in six, people worldwide are infected by hookworms causing gastrointestinal blood loss and iron deficiency anemia. The hematophagous hookworm Ancylostoma caninum produces a family of small, disulfide-linked protein anticoagulants (75­84 amino acid residues). One of these nematode anticoagulant proteins, NAP5, inhibits the amidolytic activity of factor Xa (fXa) with Ki = 43 pM, and is the most potent natural fXa inhibitor identified thus far. The crystal structure of NAP5 bound at the active site of -carboxyglutamic acid domainless factor Xa (des-fXa) has been determined at 3.1 Å resolution, which indicates that Asp189 (fXa, S1 subsite) binds to Arg40 (NAP5, P1 site) in a mode similar to that of the BPTI/trypsin interaction. However, the hydroxyl group of Ser39 of NAP5 additionally forms a hydrogen bond (2.5 Å) with His57 NE2 of the catalytic triad, replacing the hydrogen bond of Ser195 OG to the latter in the native structure, resulting in an interaction that has not been observed before. Furthermore, the C-terminal extension of NAP5 surprisingly interacts with the fXa exosite of a symmetry-equivalent molecule forming a short intermolecular -strand as observed in the structure of the NAPc2/ fXa complex. This indicates that NAP5 can bind to fXa at the active site, or the exosite, and to fX at the exosite. However, unlike NAPc2, NAP5 does not inhibit fVIIa of the fVIIa/TF complex.

Active- and exo-site inhibition of factor Xa

775 serine proteases for potency and specificity with 25 M NAP5 showed only 50% inhibition of just one, fXIa (Ki = 3.8 nM). The highest level of inhibition among the others (13­15%) was with kallikrein, activated protein C and tissue-type plasminogen activator. NAP5 and NAP6 inhibit thrombin formation by direct association at the catalytic site of fXa. In the case of NAP5, Arg40 is the specificity site P1 residue, while phenylalanine is at this position in NAP6, which most likely accounts for the 20-fold decrease in potency of the latter, since the Phe40/Arg mutant of NAP6 possesses the same relative activity as NAP5.11 NAPc2, another slightly larger (seven to nine residues) member of the A. caninum family of anticoagulants differs from NAP5 and NAP6, since it only partially inhibits the amidolytic activity of fXa and inhibits thrombin formation by binding to fXa at an exosite distinct and remote from the active center,14 with the resultant binary complex inactivating the TF-fVIIa complex with Ki = 35 pM.11 The non-hematophagous Ascaris family of nematodes parallels that of Ancylostoma hookworms in producing small proteins that inactivate chymotrypsin, elastase, trypsin, pepsin and carboxypeptidase.15 The physiological roles of these inhibitory proteins differ from those of Ancylostoma, in that they protect the worms from proteolytic degradation by digestive enzymes of the host through intestinal up-take, whereas the hematophagous hookworm inhibitors shut down the coagulation machinery in order to feed freely on blood and subsist. The similarities between the two notwithstanding, the sequences of the proteins from the two different species display little homology (b30% overall, 13% from the five disulfides alone),11 although a high degree of sequential congruence exists among the different inhibitors of each species.11,15 An NMR structure determination of Ascaris trypsin inhibitor (ATI) has been described,16 as well as a crystallographic structure of the Ascaris chymotrypsin-elastase (C/E-1) inhibitor bound to elastase.17 A unique feature of the C/E-1 elastase complex is the penetration of Arg217A of the enzyme through a pore formed by the Cys17­Cys29 disulfide loop of the inhibitor.17 Clinically used anticoagulants are based either on coumarins, 18 which interfere with the vitamin K-dependent proteins, or on heparins,19 which enhance the inhibition of both thrombin and fXa by antithrombin III. Both these anticoagulants are clinically difficult to control, since they are highly unspecific and often produce harmful side-effects. This has stimulated the study and search for alternative anticoagulants such as snake venom proteins that inhibit coagulation by binding to the Gla domain of fXa,20 or highly specific exositebinding peptide and protein inhibitors of blood coagulation factors such as fXa11 and fVIIa.21 We present here the crystal structure of recombinant NAP5 bound to the active site of des-fXa. We describe the overall structure and the mode of binding assisted by an unexpected hydrogen bond formed between Ser39 from NAP5 and His57 of the catalytic triad of fXa along with a regional (or local)

dent glycoprotein, synthesized in the liver, circulates in the plasma as a two-chain protein linked by a disulfide bridge.1 The light chain (16.2 kDa, 139 residues) is comprised of a -carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain containing 11 Gla residues,2 and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules with a -hydroxyaspartic acid residue in the N-terminal EGF1 domain.3,4 The heavy chain (42.7 kDa, 303 residues) with two N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites harbors the inactive catalytic serine protease domain.5 fX is converted to its active fXa form by either the factor VIIa (fVIIa)/tissue factor (TF)/cellular surface/Ca2+ extrinsic pathway complex or by the fIXa/fVIIIa/cellular surface/Ca2+ Xase intrinsic pathway complex and fXa also participates in the formation of the prothrombinase complex (prothrombin/fXa/fVa/cellular surface/ Ca2+) that converts prothrombin to thrombin by limited proteolysis.6 A number of enzymes that participate in the blood coagulation cascade can be activated by snake venom proteinases.7,8 Some organisms, such as leeches, ticks, certain types of bats and hookworms, have developed strategic survival mechanisms that permit them to feed from a wide range of mammalian hosts, including man.9­11 Human hookworm infection of the small intestine dates back to the beginning of dog domestication (3500 BC), results in the loss of up to 0.2 ml of blood per day,12 and is a leading cause of anemia in the tropics and subtropics, affecting nearly one billion, or one in six, people worldwide,. Like other hematophagous organisms, hookworms have evolved highly effective anticoagulant mechanisms and molecules to facilitate the acquisition of blood for their survival. The hematophagous hookworm Ancylostoma caninum produces a family of small disulfidelinked protein anticoagulants (75­84 amino acid residues, Figure 1).10,11 One of these nematode anticoagulant proteins, NAP5, cloned by Corvas International and under development for the prevention and treatment of disorders involving abnormal blood clot formation or thrombosis, inhibits the amidolytic activity of fXa with Ki = 43 pM.11,13 The only other natural inhibitor of fXa with a comparable potency to NAP5 is the tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) (Ki = 59 pM).8 A similar, highly homologous (90%) member of the family (NAP6) inhibits catalytic activity of fXa with Ki 1.0 nM. In testing NAP5 against 11 other

776 subsidiary binding site. Surprisingly, the NAPc2binding exosite14 of a symmetry-related fXa molecule in the NAP5-fXa crystal structure is also utilized to bind NAP5 and involves the formation of an antiparallel -strand between the C-terminal segment of NAP5 with one of the -strands of the seven-stranded -barrel (6) and part of the C-terminal helix of fXa. The fXa exosite interactions of NAP5 and NAPc2 are compared, and models for the binding of NAP6 and ixolaris, a two-Kunitz domain fXa inhibitor from the salivary gland of the hard tick Ixodes scapularis,22 which is a vector for Lymes disease, are discussed.

Active- and exo-site inhibition of factor Xa

Structure of NAP5 The mean temperature factor of the NAP5 inhibitor (45 Å2) is slightly greater than that of the EGF2 domain of fXa (42 Å2) but, like the latter, it is generally well defined in the final (2Fo­Fc) electron density maps, except for the first two N-terminal residues, the C terminus (Val77) and some surface side-chains (Glu5, Glu27, Glu31, Lys19, Lys24, and Arg65). The latter are characterized by breaks in the density but are sufficiently well defined to be included in the final model. The quality of the (2Fo­Fc) electron density of the whole NAP5-desfXa structure is exceptionally good ,considering the resolution (3.1 Å), most likely due to the high redundancy (9.1) of the diffraction measurements. The overall shape of NAP5 is that of a distorted oval (axial lengths of 25 Å and 16 Å), wedge-shaped discoid with the N and C termini located on the same side of the molecule, physically separated by two short -strands (4, and5) and a 310-turn (Glu66­ Cys69) but held together with the aid of a bivalent salt-bridge (Glu10, Glu22, and Arg56) (Figure 2, Table 1). The C-terminal region is located across the oval diagonally opposite the reactive-site P1 residue (Arg40). An extended C terminus ( 29 Å) consisting of eight or nine residues emanates from the 310 turn (Figure 2). Although, as will be seen, this segment binds to fXa, it may be flexible and disordered in the unbound inhibitor state as described for NAPc2. The NAP5 molecule is stabilized by five disulfide bridges, four short -strands, two short helix-like structures, a bivalent salt-bridge and numerous other hydrogen bonds and buried hydrophobic interactions (Figure 2, Table 1). The four short -strands that are approximately perpendicular to each other in the NAP5 structure (1, Glu10­Asp13; 3, Ala47­Cys50; 4, Tyr55­Asp57; 5, Asp62­Val64) are arranged in about the same relative orientations as those of the ATI and C/E-1 hookworm inhibitors (-strand numbering is that used by Huang et al.;17 2 reported in the latter does not appear to interact closely with 4 and 5 in either inhibitor structure).16,17 Since the ATI and C/E-1 inhibitors contain only 62 and 63 residues, respectively, while NAP5 contains 77, and their structures basically differ from NAP5 because of smaller disulfide loop sizes, only the C coordinates of 14 -strand residues of NAP5 were superposed (Figure 2) on the corresponding coordinates of C/E117 and resulted in rmsd = 0.77 Å. About 50 of the 63 C/E-1 residues fit the NAP5 fold reasonably well (5­ 35, 46­50, and 53­69), while the largest deviation occurs in the overlap of the 36­46 loop, which contains the reactive-site position of the inhibitors (Arg40 for NAP5, Leu31 for C/E-1) (Figure 2). Three of the five disulfide bridges located on the surface containing the N and C-terminal residues (Cys6­ Cys48, Cys50­Cys63, Cys25­Cys69) (Figure 2) superpose well. The other two disulfide bridges differ in one of the cysteine positions. The latter (Cys37­ Cys42) are in the 36­46 loop that does not superpose globally between the two structures. One of these disulfides (Cys21­Cys37) bridges between two short

Results and Discussion
Structure of des-fXa The C-terminal EGF2 module and the catalytic domain of des-fXa are well defined in the final (2Fo­ Fc) electron density map of NAP5-fXa to Arg245 of the catalytic domain and Arg139 of EGF2. However, several surface Glu, Lys and Arg side-chains have partial or no density. In addition, the whole N-terminal EGF1 module, and its leading pentapeptide, is flexibly disordered as in other des-fXa structures.23­25 Since the catalytic domain ends at Arg245, the fXa of the NAP5-fXa complex corresponds to the des-fXa structure5 lacking a C-terminal hexapeptide, which was probably lost by autolysis. Like other inhibited fXa structures,24­26 there is no apparent cleavage in the autolysis loop region of NAP5-fXa (His145­ Thr153) as was observed in the native structure.23 Optimal superposition of the C positions of the catalytic domain of fXa of NAP5-fXa on those of native fXa (PDB code 1HCG) results in a rmsd of 0.50 Å for 216 of a total 233 (97%) C atoms (nine positions deviating by more than 1.0 Å); the rmsd of EGF2 C positions is larger at 0.71 Å for 49 of 50 (98%) C atoms (five deviations greater than 1.0 Å). The larger deviation of the EGF2 domain is related to its higher B-values (native fXa: bBN = 27 Å for the catalytic domain, bBN = 37 Å2 for EGF2; NAP5-fXa, bBN = 32 Å2 and 42 Å2, respectively). Specific monovalent cation effects in blood coagulation were first reported for fXa,27 followed by thrombin,28 and activated protein C.29 The Na+ binding site in the structure of fXa is in the same relative position as that in thrombin.30 An incomplete octahedral Na+ site is present in the structure of NAP5-fXa composed of carbonyl oxygen atoms from Tyr185, Asp185A, Ala221, Arg222 and Lys224 with a Na+ ion occupancy of 1.0 and B = 16 Å2. The composition of the site differs from that of native fXa, in lacking one water molecule and by Ala221O replacing a second water molecule. The catalytic domain of fXa also has a calcium ion-binding site31 in the vicinity of Arg70­Glu80, like fVIIa,32 fIXa,33 and trypsin.34 However no calcium ion was found in the vicinity of the Ca2+ -binding loop (no Ca2+ was present in the crystallization protocols and any residual Ca2+ was essentially diluted and dialyzed out).

NAP5-desfXa structure, the main chain of Arg38­ Arg40 runs roughly antiparallel to Ser214­Gly216 of fXa in a substrate-like binding manner, forming a -strand hydrogen bond between Arg38 O and Gly216 N (3.0 Å), and possibly a longer one between Arg40 N and Ser214 O (3.6 Å) (Figure 3). The sidechain of Arg40 occupies the S1 specificity site of fXa in an extended conformation, forming a single N­single O hydrogen bonded salt-bridge through its guanidinium NH2 atom and one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp189 (OD1, 2.6 Å) (Figure 3). This interaction differs from the twin N- twin O doubly hydrogen bonded salt-bridge usually encountered between substrates and inhibitors at the S1 specificity site of thrombin.35,36 Different types of salt-bridges have been observed with thrombin,35 but a survey of intra-molecular arginine­carboxylate interactions indicates that twin­twin contacts involving NE and NH1 (or NH2) of arginine and single N­single O contacts are much more prevalent.37 fXa displays a similar variability in the S1 site binding with: (1) a single O-twin amidino arrangement in the DX-9065a complex;24 (2) a twin­twin geometry through an amidino group in the FX-2212- fXa inhibited structure;26 and (3) through a lone hydrogen bond between an aromatic tyrosyl hydroxyl group of TAP and Asp189 OD2 in TAP­fXa.25 Although the location of the hydrophobic TAP tyrosine residue in the S1 site of fXa, that has arginine-like specificity, is somewhat unusual, an indole has been reported to bind in the S1 site of thrombin.38 The carbonyl oxygen atom of Arg40 at the P1 position is positioned in the oxyanion hole hydrogen bonding with Gly193 N (2.6 Å) and Ser195 N (2.8 Å). In addition, Ser195 OG is located over the plane of the Arg40 carboxyamide group directly bridging Arg40 C (2.8 Å) and Arg40 N (3.1 Å) (Figure 3). Thus, the interaction of the electrophilic center of the P1 residue of NAP5 at the catalytic site of fXa closely resembles that of a substrate or inhibitor transition state intermediate, which has been observed in other serine proteinase complexes.39­41 The Ser39, P2 residue, of NAP5 is somewhat unusual because it is not generally encountered at this position in substrates or peptidic-like inhibitors of serine proteases and it is the last residue of a short distorted helix containing a 310-turn of Pro35­Arg38

Ribbon representation with interacting side-chains as sticks: NAP5 atom colors are: carbon, white; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; fXa side-chains are in yellow; hydrogen bonds are shown as black broken lines.

(H-2, Table 1) (Figure 3); Arg38 is at the P3 position of the substrate. The turn of this distorted helix results in the formation of a hydrogen bond between Pro35 O (P5 residue) and Tyr99 OH (2.9 Å) essentially terminating NAP5 interactions in this direction. The hydroxyl group of Ser39 additionally forms a hydrogen bond (2.75 Å) with His57 NE2 of the catalytic triad, replacing the hydrogen bond of Ser195 OG to the latter in the native structure (Figure 3).23 The latter distance is now 4.0 Å in the NAP5-des-fXa structure. In forming this hydrogen bond with NAP5, the imidazole group of His57 maintains its position of the unbound structure and its native state hydrogen bond between His57 ND1 and Asp102 OD1 (2.6 Å) (Figure 3). Both the former interactions have not been observed previously between substrates or inhibitors of serine proteinases. Other important hydrogen bonds of Ser39 are: Ser39 N­Tyr99 OH (3.0 Å) and Ser39 O- Gln192 NE2 (3.0 Å). The tyrosyl group of Tyr99 rotates about 90° around the CG-CZ direction with respect to its position in fXa,23 and its hydroxyl group moves 2.0 Å from its position in native fXa. The Ser39­Gln192 interaction is not unlike the Asn2 O­ Gln192 OE1 (3.2 Å) interaction in TAP-fXa. Although the latter chain runs parallel with Ser214­Glu217 of fXa, while the former is antiparallel, Ser39 and Asn2 are the P2 residues. The interaction in both complexes is achieved by a movement of the Gln192 side-chain, which is largest in TAP-fXa. In TAP-fXa, Gln192 NE2 hydrogen bonds with Ala8 O of TAP,25 whereas its different position in NAP5-fXa leads to an intramolecular hydrogen bond with Arg143NH2 (3.2 Å). As will be seen next, both interactions involve the active center subsidiary binding site of fXa. The methylene groups of Arg38, located at the P3 position, are surrounded on three sides by the tyrosyl group of Tyr99, the indole of Trp215 and the side-group of Ile36 of NAP5. The plane of the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg38 stacks parallel with the

-electron face of Phe174 of fXa (eight contacts b3.5 Å) leading to a cation- electron-mediated interaction, also called an ion-quadrupole attraction,42­44 which appears to be unique and common to fXa and has been observed at the S3 site of other fXa complexes.24,25,36,45 The phenyl group of Phe174 is displaced slightly by the encroaching guanidinium group of Arg38 of NAP5 compared to native fXa, while in TAP-Xa, the phenyl ring moves in the opposite direction. Since the main chain of TAP binds in a retro-manner in the active center, its Arg3 is not positioned optimally for binding as Arg38 in NAP5 (planes of guanidiniums differ by 2.3 Å) but the interaction is nonetheless maintained by the attraction (movement) of Phe174 in the direction of the guanidinium of Arg3 of TAP. Two other aromatic residues in the vicinity (Tyr99, Trp215) have been suggested to assist in the cation recognition interaction by fXa.24,45 Subsidiary binding site of fXa The P1­P2 residues of NAP5 (Gly41-Cys42), located on the C-terminal side of the scissile bond, are in close proximity to fXa. Since the NAP5 chain branches at Cys42, Cys15­Asp53 and Leu43­Pro45 are likely P3­P5 site residues (Figure 1). The Cys42 residue is at the P2 position of substrate and its nitrogen atom forms a main chain hydrogen bond with Phe41 O (3.3 Å) while the Asp14 residue makes a hydrogen bonded salt-bridge between Asp14 OD1Arg143 NH2 (2.4 Å) with another hydrogen bond from OD2 to Gln151 N (2.7 Å). This salt-bridge with Arg143 is further shared with a hydrogen bond and the negative charge between Asp13 OD1 and Arg143 NH2 (3.4 Å). Since Cys15­Asp13 of NAP5 doubles back over the P1­ P3 residues after branching at Cys42, they are not positioned for substrate-like binding (at the S3­S5 sites) but rather, bind at a subsidiary site assisting active site binding (Figure 3), which positions also utilize most of the residues

779 15% for the same time in the presence of NAP5 ([fXa] = 11.3 M, [NAP5] = 13.6 M, [trypsin] = 182 nM). TAP inhibition protects fXa similarly. The total surface buried between NAP5 and des-fXa in the active and subsidiary binding site regions is 954 Å2, which corresponds to about 16% of the NAP5 surface and about 8.5% of fXa. Summarizing the NAP5 active site and subsidiary site interactions with fXa: it forms four hydrogen bonded salt-bridges and two cation-aromatic  electron-ion quadrupole interactions. This agrees well with the effect of NaCl on the binding of NAP5 to immunocaptured FXa. The ED50 for blocking half of the NAP5 binding was measured to be about 2 M NaCl. In contrast, NaCl (up to 1 M) had no effect on the binding of NAP5 to immunocaptured EGR-fXa. Furthermore, it forms a total of 16 hydrogen bonds, an antiparallel -strand with fXa, an enzyme­substrate transition state intermediate complex, in addition to an undecapeptide segment fitting closely in surface grooves of the active site region (86 contacts b 3.5 Å). Comparison of NAP5-fXa with C/E-1 inhibited elastase The C coordinates of elastase of the C/E-1 elastase complex were superposed on those of des-fXa of the NAP5-fXa complex with a rmsd = 1.1 Å for 171 of 227 (75%) C atoms (69 positions deviating by more than 1.0 Å). The rotation matrix and translation vector thus determined was then used to superimpose the C/E-1 elastase structure on that of NAP5-fXa. The C/E-1 inhibitor binds to elastase in a very similar way to the manner in which NAP5 binds to fXa. The principal difference between the two inhibitors is a rotation of the C/E-1 -strand structure with respect to that of NAP5, since the respective reactive-site residues are in different spatial positions in a global superposition (Figure 1). This results in the close overlap of the P1 residues of both inhibitors (Arg40 of NAP5, Leu31 of C/E-1) in the specificity sites of their cognate enzymes. The catalytic site binding loop of NAP5 extends from Cys37 to Cys42 while that of C/E-1 is from Cys29 to Cys33. The additional residue in the NAP5 stretch compared to C/E-1, which is N-terminal to the scissile bond is absorbed by a 310-turn in NAP5 (Pro35­Arg38) not present in the C/E-1 inhibitor. Comparing the CA, C, N, O coordinates of the P3­P2 residues of the reactive-site loops of NAP5 and C/E-1 gives rmsd = 0.70 Å. Thus, although the global positioning of the reactive-site loop is different in the two inhibitors (Figure 1), its local superposition corresponds to the same arrangement. This same canonical conformation, also found in the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)­trypsin complex,39,47 is seen in a number of other protein inhibitors of serine proteases.17 A unique feature of the C/E-1 elastase complex is the penetration of the side-group of Arg217A through a pore in the inhibitor formed by the Cys17­Cys29 loop, where Arg221A makes 14 interactions with residues around the pore.17 Since fXa does not have

and interacting atoms of the subsidiary binding site of fXa observed in the TAP­fXa complex. A complete list of interactions of the subsidiary binding site are given in Table 2.25 Thus, the lengthy contiguous undecapeptide segment (Pro35­Asp13) of NAP5 binds to and interacts with both the active and subsidiary binding site regions of fXa. It is the unique folding conformations of NAP5 and TAP that lead to the additional stabilization of the inhibitor­enzyme complex beyond active site interactions through hydrogen bonds and salt-bridge interactions with this subsidiary binding region. Another subsidiary site salt-bridge contact occurs between Asp52 OD1 and Lys147 NZ (3.0 Å) along with possibly a cation- electron-mediated interaction ( 2.7 Å) between Tyr3 and the guanidinium moiety of Arg150 in the same vicinity (the density of the arginyl side-chain is well defined only to NE). The remainder of the NAP5 molecule extends outward from the surface and does not interact directly with fXa. However, the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Glu33 both hydrogen bond with Ow821 (occupancy factor z = 1.0, B = 30 Å2), which is linked to Arg222 NH1 through Ow817 (z = 0.77, B = 34 Å2) by two more hydrogen bonds, unlike TAP, the NAP5 structure extends away from FXa in this region, hence the bridging water molecules to Arg222 and the lack of more binding interactions; Arg222 is found also in the subsidiary binding site of Tap-fXa. Thus, NAP5-fXa utilizes all but two of the residues (Glu146 and Lys224) reported in the subsidiary binding site of TAP-Xa. From Table 1, it is clear that the subsidiary site of fXa is larger than that of NAP5-fXa or TAP-fXa alone and is principally comprised of the so-called autolysis loop of fXa (Arg143­Gln151), found also in thrombin,46 along with at least the neighboring Arg222­Lys224 segment. Proteolytic cleavages occur in this region in native fXa23 but, as here, not in active site inhibited structures of fXa.24­26 The binding of NAP5 and TAP in the autolysis loop region is in agreement with the protection afforded by these inhibitors against proteolytic cleavage of the Lys147- Gly148 bond by trypsin. The amount of 13 kDa fXa fragment generated by trypsin in 10 min of digestion corresponds to 40% conversion, while it is only

780 the Arg217A insertion and the corresponding disulfide loop is larger (Cys21­Cys37), a pore-penetration interaction is not found in the NAP5-fXa complex. The pore appears to be preformed and not the result of a conformational change in C/E-1 due to Arg217A because it is found also in the ATI structure determined by NMR16 and is present in NAP5-fXa, which, however, lacks Arg217A. The same most likely applies when C/E-1 binds to chymotrypsin (which also does not have Arg217A). Location of the exosite on fXa In the crystal structure of NAP5-fXa, about 20 C-terminal residues (Asp57­His76) of the NAP5 molecule bound to the active site of fXa interact in a spectacular, intricate and most likely physiologically relevant manner with the N-terminal sevenstranded -barrel (2, Gln30­Ile34; 3, Gly40­ Leu47; 4, Tyr51­Thr54; 7, Ala104­Leu108; 6, Ala81­Lys90; 5, Lys65­Val68. 6 contributing twice to the formation of the barrel with Ala81­ Glu84, Glu86­Lys90 and the C-terminal -helix of a symmetry-related fXa molecule (Figure 4). The extended conformation of Glu71­His76 of NAP5 runs antiparallel to His91­Val86 of fXa making five main chain -strand hydrogen bonds with the latter (Table 3) and in this manner adds another -strand to the fXa -barrel (Figure 5(a) and (b)). Conversely, it is the electropositive polar side-groups of two turns of the amphipathic-like C-terminal helix of fXa (Lys236­Lys243), which appear to be even more important, that interact with a highly electronegative cluster of NAP5 (Asp57­Asp70), forming saltbridges and hydrogen bonds (Figure 5(a); Table 3). This stretch of NAP5 is stabilized by two disulfide bridges, Cys25­Cys69 and Cys50­Cys63 and a short

-strand (Asp62­Val64) (Figures 2 and 3), where about half (six) of the stretch are either Asp or Glu residues (Figures 1 and 5(a)). The Arg240 side-chain inserts into a deep surface pocket of NAP5 ringed by the negative charges from side-chains of Asp62 and Glu68 along with Gln71, with Asp57 located near its bottom (Figure 5(a)). The arginyl residue is well defined in the final electron density and makes hydrogen bonded salt-bridge contacts with Asp57 and Asp62 (Table 3). Two other electropositive sidechains of fXa are in the region Lys236­Lys243 making hydrogen bonded salt-bridges with Glu68 and Asp62, respectively, of the negatively charged pocket of NAP5. The total number of contacts b 3.5 Å between NAP5 and the fXa exosite-like binding region is 52, of which four are salt-bridges of varying geometry and strength along with an impressive total of 18 hydrogen bonds. The buried surface in this region is a surprising 802 Å2, which compares very favorably with the NAP5-active/subsidiary binding site (954 Å). Thus, 30% of the NAP5 is buried in binding with two fXa molecules. With NAP5 linking fXa at two different sites, infinite NAP5-fXa helical chains are formed parallel with the 61 screw axis of the crystal. In particular, there are two such chains running through the unit cell in opposite directions as a double helix satisfying crystallographic 2-fold rotation axes. The diameter of these antiparallel helical arrays is about 80 Å. The remainder of the space of the unit cell, which includes that inside the double helix, is filled with solvent giving a 73% (v/v) solvent fraction. Comparison of NAP5, NAP6 and NAPc2 The NAP inhibitors possess the same disulfide pairing, display a high level of sequence identity,

781 It is of significance that the loop containing the Arg40 reactive-site P1 residue of NAP5 adopts a very different conformation in NAPc2, so that the position of the equivalent arginine in the latter is very different. Thus, when NAPc2-fXa binds to TF-fVIIa, a conformational change most likely occurs in NAPc2 (Figure 6) to a more canonical one,39­47 either on binding to the fXa exosite, which is different from that reported here for NAP5, or it would suggest when it binds to the TF-fVIIa complex inhibiting the initiation of blood coagulation by the extrinsic pathway. Ixolaris, a tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-like protein with NAPc2-like properties Ixolaris, a potent anticoagulant protein isolated from the salivary gland of the hard tick I. scapularis consists of two Kunitz-like domains linked by a short pentapeptide sequence (Figure 7),22 is a vector for Lymes disease and inhibits the extrinsic pathway, These Kunitz-like domains share moderate sequence and structural similarities with TFPI, which consists of three multivalent Kunitz-type domains with an acidic N terminus and a basic C-terminal extension. In TFPI, the first domain binds to the active site of fVIIa, the second binds to and inhibits fXa, and the third domain has been implicated in modulating the interaction with lipoproteins. The 20 peptide linker between the first and second domains of TFPI permits simultaneous binding at the active sites of fVIIa and fXa, respectively. Ixolaris possesses a shorter linker peptide that contains two proline residues, binds stoichiometrically either to fX or to fXa at the exosite and inhibits the fVIIa/TF complex in a mode similar to NAPc2. The first domain of ixolaris contains a glutamate residue instead of lysine or arginine at position 36 (the sequence numbering is based on TFPI), which is not productive for binding to the active site of fVIIa. Sequence alignments indicate that the C-terminal region of ixolaris18 shares significant homology with the NAPc2 and NAP5 C-termini, this region of ixolaris was modeled on the basis of the crystal structure of the fXa/NAPc2 complex (Figure 7). Since the first domain does not contain either lysine or arginine residues at the P1 position, the second domain likely plays a dual role in the inhibition of the extrinsic pathway. The P1 position in the second domain is occupied by arginine, which can interact with Asp189 (S1 subsite), whereas the C terminus interacts with the fX/fXa exosite. These features suggest that the second Kunitz domain and the extended C terminus of ixolaris likely play roles similar to that of the analogous domains of NAPc2 in inhibiting the extrinsic pathway. Biological implications The lack of selectivity of the coumarin and heparin-based compounds and the strategic position of fXa in the blood coagulation cascade makes it an attractive target for the development of anticoagulation drugs. NAP5 is the most potent natural fXa inhibitor characterized to date and is being tested

share similar -strand structural elements and contain a C-terminal extension (8­14 amino acid residues) (Figures 1 and 6).11 NAP5 and NAP6 share 86% sequence identity, and the C-terminal extension is strictly conserved, whereas NAPc2 shares only 45% sequence identity with NAP5 and has a longer C-terminal extension (Figure 1). The structure of NAP5 bound to fXa has been compared with the crystallographic and NMR structures of NAPc2, which indicates that three of the disulfide bridges of NAPc2, (like C/E-1), overlap well and are located on the surface. The remainder of the NAPc2 structure, beyond this 10 Å × 20 Å surface strip shows only very little congruence (some possibly between Cys21 and Cys25). The -strands and the two turns of -helix are fairly well defined in all 18 different NMR structures, 48 and the NAPc2-fXa crystal structure.14 The C-terminal region of NAPc2 is ordered in the crystal structure but a dramatic conformational change occurs at the C terminus of NAPc2 when bound to fXa compared to the relative orientation of the C terminus observed in the NMR structure of NAPc2. This C-terminal conformation is quite similar to that observed in NAP5 on binding at the fXa exosite. Thus, it would seem that both NAP5 and NAPc2 undergo similar conformational changes upon binding at the FX/fXa exosite. The principal interactions in the fXa exosite are the formation of an intermolecular anti-parallel -sheet between the segments comprised of residues 86­93 of fXa and the C terminus of NAPc2/NAP5 (a complete list of contacts is given in Table 3; and see Figure 5(b)). Analogous to the P1 reactive-site NAP5 residue Arg40, NAPc2 contains arginine at position 44 (Figure 1) that likely interacts with the active site of fVIIa. However, NAP5 does not bind to fVIIa due to the presence of arginine and serine at positions P3 and P2 instead of leucine and valine as in NAPc2. In general, the reactive ­P and ­P' residues in NAPc2 are predominantly hydrophobic, whereas in NAP5 they are hydrophilic, with a large volume side-chain at position P3.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization Human des-fXa49 (39,800 kDa) was purchased from Haematologic Technologies, Inc. as 1 ml frozen aliquots at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.5),

buffer containing 150 mM NaCl. The recombinant NAP5 (8­700 kDa) was a kind gift from Corvas International, Inc.50 A 0.54 mg sample of freeze-dried NAP5 was dissolved in 50 M 0.05 M Tris­HCl ( pH 7.5) and added to a 1 ml aliquot of des-fXa solution to attain a 1.2:1 molar ratio of NAP5 to des-fXa. The complex thus formed was allowed to equilibrate overnight at 4 °C and subsequently concentrated using a Centricon 10 kDa cut-off filter and the buffer concentration was adjusted to obtain a stock solution of 10 mg/ml of NAP5-des-fXa in 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 40­50 mM NaCl. A 5.0 mg/ml solution of the complex was used to carry out an initial sparse factorial crystal screening in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with well solution (crystal screen I, Hampton Research) using the hangingdrop, vapour-diffussion crystallization method. Small hexagonal rod-like crystals grew within a week with

NAP5 disulfide bridges are shown in stick/ball structure and are numbered. overall dimensions less than 0.1 mm from conditions 5, 8, 13, 19, 21, 23, 33 and 36 and a NAP5-des-fXa concentration of 2.5 mg/ml.51,52 Of these, the condition that produced the largest crystals was number 13 (30% (w/v) PEG400, 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 M sodium citrate). Repetitive macroseeding in 8 l hanging-drop experiments, reducing the precipitant and the concentration of NAP5-des-fXa of the drop, optimized macro-seeding growth at 0.75 mg/ml of NAP5-des-fXa, 14% (w/v) PEG400, 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 M sodium citrate, 10­13 mM NaCl drop composition suspended over well solution number 13. Bulky hexagonal crystals with overall dimensions of up to 0.3 mm were obtained within a period of two to three weeks. X-ray data collection, processing and structure determination X-rays were produced by a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator equipped with Osmic confocal optics and diffraction intensities were measured utilizing an RAXIS IIc imaging plate detector from a flash-frozen crystal of dimensions 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm × 0.30 mm. Autoindexing indicated that the crystals of the NAP5-des-fXa complex belong to the space group P6122 (or enantiomorph) with a = b = 137.2 Å, c = 167.7 Å and Vm = 4.6 Å3/Da (0.27 protein fraction) for 12 molecules in the asymmetric unit, consistent with the low resolution of the diffraction data that fell off very rapidly beyond 3.1 Å, and with the extremely fragile nature of the crystals. The raw intensity data were integrated and scaled in point group 622 with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK.53 The statistics of the intensity data processing are given in Table 4. The orientation and position of the catalytic and EGF2 domains of des-fXa were determined by molecular replacement techniques with the program AMoRe,54 using the coordinates of the same modules of native desfXa (PDB code 1HCG)23 stripped of solvent as a search model. The Patterson rotation search within a spherical radius of 25 Å using reflections in the (10.0­3.5) Å range satisfying |F|/ (|F|)N1.0 resulted in one distinct peak with a correlation coefficient of 0.13. The translation search conducted in space group P6122 gave the most outstanding solution (correlation coefficient 0.69) and the crystallographic R-factor was 33.7% (44.8% for P61). Rigid body refinement increased the correlation to 0.72 and decreased the R-factor to 31.3%. Examination of the (2Fo­Fc) and (Fo­Fc) difference electron density maps revealed density corresponding to much of the NAP5 molecule as well as density for residues His145­Thr153 of the autolysis loop of fXa, which are missing from the native des-fXa structure.23 Both maps, however, indicated no electron density for the EGF1 domain as in native des-fXa23 and other inhibited des-fXa structures.24,25 Positional and thermal parameter refine-

Active- and exo-site inhibition of factor Xa parameters57 compared well against expected values of structure determinations at 3.1 Å resolution. Molecular modeling and quality analysis The atomic coordinates of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor mutant with an altered binding loop (PDB accession code 1QLQ)58 and the second Kunitz domain of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (PDB accession code 1TFX)59 stripped of solvent and ligands were used to produce a scaffold to obtain the structural model of the two Kunitz-type domains of ixolaris. Each domain was modeled individually and the structure of the NAPc2 Cterminal extension was used to model the corresponding region of ixolaris. Homology-based molecular modeling was carried out using a restraint-based modeling algorithm as implemented in the MODELLER program.60 The overall model was improved, enforcing proper stereochemistry using spatial restraints and CHARMM energy terms, followed by conjugate gradient simulation based on the variable target function method.60 The loops were optimized using ModLoop61 based on the satisfaction of spatial restraints, without relying on a database of known protein structures. The final model was submitted to explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations using the GROMACS 3.2 software package,62 and the GROMOS-96 (43a1) force-field to check stability and consistency of the final model. The overall stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed by the programs PROCHECK57 and VERIFY3D.63 The mode of interaction of ixolaris with fVIIa was modeled on the basis of the coordinates of extracellular tissue factor complexed with fVIIa and inhibited by a BPTI mutant (PDB accession code 1FAK)64 and the exosite interaction with fXa was based on the structure of the fXa/NAPc2 complex (PDB accession code 2H9E).14 Protein Data Bank, accession code The coordinates of NAP5-des-fXa have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank: accession code 2P3F.

ment was conducted using the program CNS.55 An initial simulated annealing refinement of the des-fXa model with an average B-factor of 28 Å2 was carried out with the slowcool procedure in which the temperature was decreased from 2500 to 300 K in 25 intervals. In this and all subsequent refinements, about 10% of the data set (1486 reflections) was withheld for calculating the Rfree value. The slow-cool procedure calculation began at R = 39.0% (Rfree = 39.8%) and converged at R = 31.3% (Rfree = 36.2%). The corresponding difference maps showed: (1) Arg40 of NAP5 located in the S1 specificity site of fXa forming a salt-bridge with Asp189 and continuous electron density for the Cys21­Cys42 disulfide loop of NAP5, (2) clear density corresponding to the autolysis loop of fXa not included in calculations; and (3) that a few residues of EGF2 were misplaced and required refitting. Incorporating all the preceding additions and changes, followed by positional and individual isotropic B-factor refinement, resulted in a crystallographic residual of 28.5% (Rfree = 33.7%). Thereafter, further manual fitting of NAP5 proceeded using the program TURBO-FRODO56 (through omit maps with a 3.0 Å radius cut-off, Ramachandran plot examinations, and comparisons with high-resolution protein structural fragments from the Protein Data Bank) followed by rounds of positional and individual B-factor refinement. A bulk solvent mask correction using (35.0­3.1) Å data was introduced into calculations when most of the NAP5 structure was included and another simulated annealing refinement was carried out. The bulk solvent correction improved the (2Fo­Fc) maps, significantly aiding tracing and map fitting of NAP5. The total number of reflections used in the bulk solvent refinement was 13,542, which satisfied I/(I)N1.5 in the 35.0­3.1 Å resolution range, while the corresponding number in the non-bulk solvent refinement range (8.0­3.1) Å was 12,706. In the final stages, 163 water molecules (Occ.N0.5, bBN = 35 Å2) were included to account for residual density at geometrically plausible water positions (R = ­2.5%, while Rfree essentially remained the same). The final Rfactor of the NAP5-des-fXa structure in the 8.0­3.1 Å range without a bulk solvent correction is 16.6% (Rfree = 26.9%). The final structure corresponds to rmsd values of 0.02 Å and 2.6° from ideal values in bond distances and bond angles. The Ramachandran plot of NAP5 had 40 residues (66.7%) in the most favored regions and 33.3% in additionally allowed regions. Various PROCHECK
