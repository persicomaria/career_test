Abstract: The isolation and structure elucidation of A90720A,1, a cyclic depsipeptide from the terrestrial blue-green alga Microchaete loktakensis is described. 1 was isolated on the basis of its
thrombin inhibitory activity and its structure was determinedusing spectral methods and amino acid analysis. The absolute configurationsof the constituentamino acids were found to be as follows: the nucleus contains L-threonine, L-arginine, L-3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone(Ahp, i.e., glutamic acid-7-carboxaldehyde),L-leucine, L-N-methyl-tyrosineand L-valine. The side chain off the Lthreonineamino group containsD-leucine,followed by a 3-O-sulfatedR-glyceratemoiety. Cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and coronary artery occlusion continue to be major causes of morbidity and mortality, and it is likely that improved pharmacological control of blood clot formation will remain a major goal. Heparin or aspirin are frequently used to lengthen clotting time but are not without side effects, especially for chronic use. The process of blood coagulation is triggered by a complex proteolytic cascade that leads to the formation of fibrin. Thrombin is a serine protease that cleaves a peptide fragment from fibrinogen which then leads to the generation of fibrin, a major component of blood clots. In a search for novel thrombin inhibitors we have screened a large number of extracts from microbiological sources, including blue-green algae, in a high volume colorimetric bioassay using bovine thrombin and a synthetic peptide substrate, l Studies on the bioactive metabolites produced by this class of photosynthetic microbes has led to a wide variety of unique natural products with therapeutic potential. In this paper we describe the isolation and structure elucidation of A90720A ( 1 ) , a potent inhibitor of thrombin, trypsin and plasmin, obtained from the extract of the blue-green alga Microchaete loktakensis. A90720A is a new cyclic depsipeptide which contains a sulfated glyceric acid moiety in the sidechain and is structurally related to previously described blue-green algal-derived cyclic peptides such as the aeruginopeptins, cyanopeptolins, microcystilide A, and the micropeptins, all obtained from Microcystis species 2a-e, as well as dolastatin 13 from the blue-green algal-grazing sea hare Dolabella auricularia. 3 No useful antibacterial, antifungal or cytotoxic activities of 1 have yet been detected. However, it was found to be a fairly non-specific serine protease inhibitor active against bovine thrombin (IC50 = 270 ng/ml), bovine trypsin (IC50 = 10 ng/ml) and human plasmin (IC50 = 30 ng/ml). Of the previously mentioned cyclic peptides, only the micropeptins are reported to be inhibitors of trypsin and plasmin. 395

A90720A (1) Isolation and Structure Elucidation. The terrestrial blue-green alga Microchaete loktakensis was collected from a soil sample acquired near Townsville, Queensland, Australia, and the pure strain was isolated from a subculture grown on solid media as previously described. 4 Taxonomic studies revealed the filamentous and heterocystous nature of this species, which is quite different from the unicellular morphology of various Microcystis species recently found to produce the cyclic depsipeptides mentioned above. Freezedried biomass was generated by liquid cultivation of the microorganism in glass carboys exposed to fluorescent lighting under controlled conditions, followed by filtration and lyophilization. Extraction with EtOH]H20 (30:70) was followed by a series of reversed-phase chromatography steps to give the bioactive material, A90720A (1, 0.05% dry weight). Analysis of proton and carbon NMR spectra of 1 (Table 1), including COSY, ROESY, and C/H correlation spectra, indicated that A90720A was peptide-like and this finding was confirmed by initial results from amino acid analysis: one Arg, one Val, one Thr, and two Leu. The NMR substructures included one Arg, one Val, one Thr, one complete Leu and one Leu lacking an amide proton resonance (Leu'), one collection of resonances corresponding to the ring and ~ / ~ protons of a Tyr, one methyl singlet attached to nitrogen, and the following two spin systems: (2) -OCH2CH(OH)- and (3) -NHCHCH2CH2CHOH. The unusual chemical shift of the Thr ~-CH resonance (5.48 ppm in d6-DMSO) is diagnostic for acylation of the threonine hydroxyl, suggesting the presence of a lactone. The molecular formula of 1 was established as C45H72N10016SNa by HRFABMS [ mlz 1063.4720 (M + Na) +, A +2.6 mmul. Other ions observed included ngz 1041 (M+H) +, 983 (M+Na-SO3) +, and 961 (M+H-SO3) +. The accurate mass of m/z 983 was 983.5153, which agreed with the calculated mass of 983.5178 and confirmed the presence of a sulfate functionality in the molecule. Treatment of 1 with ammonia without subsequent purification resulted in a preparation which gave a FABMS containing an ion at m/z 979 (M+H-SO3+H20) +, corresponding to ring-opened, desulfated A90720A. The CID spectrum of rn/z 979 yielded a series of ions which suggested the following partial sequence: - X - Leu - NMeTyr - Val-OH, where X = C5H7NO2. Partial hydrolysis of I with 6N aqueous HCI for two days at a nominal 40°C gave a mixture of compounds; accurate mass measurements for ions observed in the FABMS of the hydrolysis mixture allowed the peptides listed in Table 2 to be identified.

These fragments as a group contained sequence information complementary to that derived from NMR spectra, but they did not distinguish between Leu and Leu', and they did not help locate the sulfate group. Table 2. Peotides from Partial Hydrolysis of I with 6N HC1.

Sequential information from NMR for the A90720A substructures was provided by the ROESY spectrum and by long-range C/H correlations (Figure 1). Four consecutive Nt-I/ct ROESY correlations provided the linkage (4): - 2 - Leu - Thr - Arg - 3 -. A similar NH/~ correlation linked the Val and NMeTyr, and the N-methyl protons had a long-range correlation to the Leu' carbonyl carbon. A ROESY crosspeak between the ct resonances of NMeTyr and Leu' required that the peptide bond between these groups be cis, as in 5. Additional C/H long-range correlations connected the Leu' ct proton to its own CO and to a final amide carbonyl, and this carbon in turn had long-range correlations from both the methine protons of 3. The Val carbonyl carbon had correlations from its own ct proton and from the Thr 13hydrogen. The two fragments 4 and 5 contained all of the eight carbonyls indicated by the 13C NMR spectrum, suggesting that the lactone carbonyl which acylates the Thr hydroxyl must be the Val carbonyl, in agreement with the FABMS finding of a C-terminal Val after mild basic hydrolysis of A90720A. The Thr-Val ester survived treatment with 6N HC1 in three of the fragments listed in Table 2.

The Leu' nitrogen and the amide carbonyl attached to it combine with 3 to form a hemiacetal, 3amino-6-hydroxy-piperidone (Ahp, i.e., glutamate-8-carboxaldehyde), linking the Leu' and Arg residues; the Ahp unit was first reported in an analogous cyclodepsipeptide with a somewhat different amino acid composition, dolastatin 13 (9) 3 (Figure 2). The cyclic peptide produced by combining fragments 4 and 5 contained all of the elements of A90720A except for the sulfate group. The proton 1D and COSY NMR spectra showed OH resonances for the NMeTyr OH, the hydroxyl on 3, and the secondary hydroxyl on 2; no coupling was observed between the CH2 protons of 2 and a hydroxyl proton, leaving this as the sulfate site and completing the structure of 1. Both micropeptin 902e and oscillapeptin 5 contain analogous sulfate groups.

Chiralities of the standard amino acids in 1 were determined by C18 reverse phase HPLC analysis of chiral OPA-NAC (o-phthal-dialdehyde-N-Ac-L-cysteine)6 derivatives: L-Arg, L-Val, L-Thr, L-Leu, D-Leu. The presence of L-N-methyltyrosine and, again, D- and L-Leu was confirmed by similar analysis of DNPA (Marfey reagent, 2,4-dinitro-phenyl-L-alaninamide) derivatives. 7 During the course of this work several similar structures have been reported, as previously mentioned, including microcystilide A 2e (6), micropeptin 2d A (7), cyanopeptolin A 2b (8), and the aeruginopeptins 2a. See Figure 2. Unlike 1, however, all of these depsipeptides contain exclusively L-amino acids, both in the lactone ring and in the tail. The chirality of the Ahp unit has not been described except on the basis of inferences from NMR characteristics and its derivation

from L-glutamic acid, in the case of 8 2b. The compounds 6-8 all contain a blocked L-Lcu between Ahp and an N-methyl Tyr or Phe, as does 1, and the virtual identity of chemical shifts for the Leu' protons in the four compounds (see Figure 2 and Table 3) suggests that the orientation of the Leu' sidechain with respect to the adjacent aromatic ring is identical in the four materials. Thus, based on NMR data alone, the L-Leu of 1 would be part of the depsipeptide ring, and the o-Leu and glyceric acid make up the tail;this conclusion is confm'ned by the crystallographic results mentioned below. In addition, the data of Table 3 suggest that the stereochemistry of the Ahp residues in 6, 7, and 8 must be the same as that of A90720A, which is shown to be L-Ahp in the trypsin-A90720A cocrystal.8 The observation of two small values of J,y~ and one large and one small Ja~ for the Ahp ring of 1, as also described for 8, is consistent with a twisted chair conformation for the six-membered ring, having the ct proton and the 8-OH group in axial positions. Thus, in solution, the hexadepsipeptide ring of A90720A appears to be a rather rigid, constrained structure, as indicated by a large number of interresidue NOEs; many of these are shown in Figure 3 and are shared with the related compounds.

During the course of the structure elucidation process, we were able to take advantage of the fairly potent antitrypsin activity of I by attempting a bovine trypsin-A90720A cocrystallization experiment. While this successful effort has been published 8 it is useful here to note that the conformations of the cyclic peptide in solution as determined by NMR and in the crystalline enzyme-bound state appear very similar. The nucleus in the bound state has an elliptical shape stabilized by two transannular hydrogen bonds involving the Ahp residue, one between the Ahp NH and the Val carbonyl and the second between the Ahp ~ hydroxyl and the Val NH. Although we did not explicitly search for evidence of hydrogen bonds in the A90720A NMR studies (such as by temperature or solvent variation) and have yet to perform a rigorous evaluation of coupling constants for dihedral angle determination, the presence of the same two transannular bonds in solution is suggested by inter-residue NOEs shown in Figure 3, one between the Ahp NH and the Thr ~ CH, adjacent to the lactone, and one between the Ahp ~ OH and the Val NH. Similarly, the Leu' and Nmethyl tyrosine side chains are connected by a number of NOE's in Figure 3, and these two sidechains occupy the trypsin hydrophobic pocket in the cocrystal. Finally, dolastatin 13 (9) contains an O-methylated glyceric acid unit in its side chain but its absolute configuration has not been previously reported. We were eventually able to chemically solve the chirality of the glycerate moiety of l by using a coupled column HPLC procedure where Cu (II) - L-proline eluent of the acid hydrolysate of 1, followed by Fe(III)-glycerate detection led to the identification of the R glycerate enantiomer. 9 This result was confirmed by the trypsin-A90720A cocrystal structure. Thus, in summary, physical and chemical evidence points to the presence of all L amino acids in the ring of l, and the presence of i) leucine and R glycerate in the sidechain. In comparison, the Microcystisderived cyclic peptides2a-e possess only L amino acids.

Experimental Section

General. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer at 298OK; solvents used were DMSO-d 6, CD3OD or CD3OH, and CD3CN plus a few drops of either CD3OD or CD3OH to bring the A90720A fully into solution. Standard vendor software and pulse sequences were used for various two-dimensional NMR experiments including COSY, TOCSY, ROESY (150 msec mixing time), and direct and long-range (70 msec evolution time) carbon/proton correlations. Mass spectral analyses were conducted in FAB mode on a VG-ZAB-2SE mass spectrometer using bombardment with Cs ions having a net energy of 20 keV. Samples were dispersed in either glycerol/oxalic acid or a 5:1 mixture of dithiothreitol/dithioerythreitol ("magic bullet"). Accurate mass determinations were performed at a resolution of 10,000 (10% valley) using external mass standards. Culture Conditions. An epilithic form of Microchaete loktakensis Bruhl & Biswas (Nostacales, Microchaetaceae), designated strain number IC-39-2, was isolated from an algal sample collected from the grounds of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Townsville, Queensland) in 1990. Cultures were grown in BG-11 liquid medium in 45 L glass bottles using the procedure described previously. After 30 days, the alga was harvested by filtration and freeze-dried. Yields of lyophilized alga averaged 0.4 g/L. Isolation. Lyophilized M. loktakensis (38 g) was extracted with EtOH/H20 (3:7) for 24 hr, then filtered through diatomaceous earth and concentrated. The extract (8.98 g) was dissolved in H20 and chromatographed on a 2.5 cm i.d. X 45 cm steel column of HP-20SS (Diaion) using a 120 rain linear gradient of 0% to 100% MeOH at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. Fractions containing A90720A (1), as determined by bioassay, were combined and concentrated to yield a residue (48.5 mg). Further purification over a Zorbax Phenyl column (2.5 cm i.d. x 25 cm, DuPont) using a 95 min linear gradient of CH3CN: 0.2% HOAc buffer (adjusted to pH 5.1 with NaOH) afforded a single component. 1 elutes at 5.3 min using an analytical Zorbax Phenyl column (4.1 mm i.d. × 25 cm, 31:69 CH3CN/0.2% HOAc, pH 5.1 with NaOH) at a wavelength of 215 nm.) This material was desalted by passage of an aqueous solution of I over an HP20 (Dialon) column and the pure factor was eluted with MeOH to afford 18 mg (0.05% dry weight) of A90720A (1). A90720A (1): Colorless solid; [aiD -32.50 (c 0.004, MeOH); UV(MeOH) ~ max 278 (C 20670) and 213 (E 138100) nm; IR (KBr) ~) max 3374, 2962, 1739, 1664, 1518, 1446, 1207 cm -1; 1H and 13C NMR (see Table 1); FABMS m / z 1063 (M+Na) +, 1041 (M+H) +, 983 (M+Na-SO3) + and 961 (M+H-SO3)+; HRFABMS m/z 1063.4720 (M+Na)+; calcd for C45H72N10016SNa, 1063.4746). Hydrolyses of I for Mass Spectral Analysis. Acidic: 2 mg of I was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 6 N HCI and heated at 40°C for two days. Basic: 1 (0.5 mg) was dissolved in 50 I.tl methanol, lml H20 , and 50 I.tl conc. NH4OH and heated at 40°C for 6 hr. Then 50 lal conc. NH4OH was added and the temp elevated to 45°C. At 7.5 hrs HPLC showed no intact A90720A remaining, and the solution was lyophilized. See Table 2.
Determination of Absolute Configuration of Amino Acids by HPLC. A90720A (10 mg) was

dissolved in 8 ml of 6 N HC1 in a sealed tube, heated at 110 - 120oc for 24 hr, and then lyophilized. Two derivatization methods were followed: OPA Method: Literature methods were followed. Analysis by HPLC: Waters NovaPak phenyl column (I, 8 mm i.d. x 100 mm) with a 10 min linear gradient at 2 ml/min (10:90 to 25:75 CH3CN/0.2% HOAc buffer, pH to 4.3 with 5 N NaOH) or a Zorbax C 18 column (II, 4.6 mm x 25 cm) with a 10 min linear gradient at 1.5 ml/min (10:90 to 31:69 CH3CN/0.2% HOAc buffer, pH to 5.7) was used. Detection (337 nm). In this manner the following chiral retention times were determined as

compared to authentic standards: (Column I): L-arginine (5.5 min), L-threonine (4.6 min), L-valine (9.9 rain), (Column H): L-leucine (3.3 min), and D-leucine (3.9 min). Marfey Method: Literature methods were used. Analysis by HPLC: Waters Novapak C18 column (8mm x 10 cm) with isocratic 25:75 CH3CN/0.1% HOAc at 2 ml/min and detection at 340 nm. In this manner the hydrolysate-derived tyrosine derivative eluted at 8.24 rain which matched the L-N-Me-tyrosine standard. Similarly, D and L leucine derivatives were found with retention times of 9.59 and 4.87 min, respectively, using 37:63 CH3CN/0.1% HOAc. Determination of Absolute Configuration of Glycerate by HPLC: Achiral/Chiral Column Switching Procedure: The resolution of glyceric acid from other amino acid constituents of the hydrolyzate was achieved on a Dionex ICE-AS6 (25 cm x 9.0 mm i.d.) ion exchange column using a mobile phase of 0.2 mM H2SO4 (1 ml/min, 205 rim). The eluted glyceric acid was collected in a 100 p.1 loop of a six-port valve and switched on to a Zorbax Rx-C8 (25 cm x 4.6 mm i.d.) column using an eluent containing Cu(II)-L-proline and 0.05% HC104 adjusted to pH 5.5 with NaOH. The column was cooled to 5° C and the mobile phase flow rate was 0.7 ml/min. The glyceric acid from the column effluent was then detected by the method of Lunder and Messori. 7 To the effluent, 2.5 mM FeC13 diluted in 0.5% HCIO4 was added through a mixing T (flow rate = 0.7 ml/min) using a third pump. The resulting solution was mixed thoroughly and its absorbance measured at 420 nm.
