SUMMARY

B. stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase catalysis proceeds via high-energy protein conformations. Unliganded MD trajectories of the pretransition-state complex with Mg2+ATP and the (post) transition-state analog complex with adenosine tetraphosphate relax rapidly in opposite directions, the former regressing, the latter progressing along the structural reaction coordinate. The two crystal ° structures (rmsd 0.7 A) therefore lie on opposite sides of a conformational free-energy maximum as the chemical transition state forms. SNAPP analysis illustrates the complexity of the associated long-range conformational coupling. Switching interactions in four nonpolar core regions are locally isoenergetic throughout the transition. Different configurations, however, propagate their effects to unfavorable, longer-range interactions at the molecular surface. Designed mutation shows that switching interactions enhance the rate, perhaps by destabilizing the ground state immediately before the transition state and limiting nonproductive diffusion before and after the chemical transition state, thereby reducing the activation entropy. This paradigm may apply broadly to energy-transducing enzymes.
INTRODUCTION Class Ic tyrosyl- and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze amino acid activation largely by using the binding energy available in the adenosine and PPi moieties of ATP for transition-state stabilization (Fersht, 1987, 1988; First and Fersht, 1995; Kapustina and Carter, 2006; Retailleau et al., 2003, 2007). Although this reasonable idea has substantial experimental support, there is no clear structural model of how changes in a protein's structure actually convert binding free energy into rate enhancement.

Structural studies on GlnRS (Bullock et al., 2003; Sherlin and Perona, 2003), GluRS (Sekine et al., 2003a, 2003b), TyrRS (Cusack et al., 2002), ArgRS (Delagoutte et al., 2000; Sekine et al., 2001), and TrpRS (Doublie et al., 1995; Ilyin et al., 2000; Retailleau et al., 2001, 2003) all show catalytically relevant relative movement of their Rossmann fold (RF) and anticodon-binding (ABD) domains. B. stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, TrpRS, as an extreme case, may accentuate functionally homologous structural variation that is more subtle for related enzymes. The extensive TrpRS structural reaction profile is thus a substantive source for missing details. TrpRS uses three-state behavior to implement the three canonical stages of enzymatic catalysis (Figures 1 and 3A). Induced fit, driven by binding both tryptophan and ATP, assembles the active site by closing and twisting the ABD relative to the RF. The resulting pretransitionstate (PreTS) conformation, represented by 1M83, an off-path ATP complex that accounts for substrate inhibition observed at high [ATP], and 1MAU, an arguably onpath complex with both tryptophanamide and ATP, was previously hypothesized for TyrRS (Fersht, 1987) as a distinct, high-energy state in the absence of ligands. Studies of TrpRS have now defined its structure (Retailleau et al., 2003) and verified its high relative conformational free energy (Retailleau et al., 2007). The catalytic step involves untwisting the ABD domain, which relocates the PPi leaving group to form a third conformation that remains closed and retains Trp-50 AMP (Products), (Doublie et al., 1995; Retailleau et al., 2001). Studies of crystal growth and an incomplete low-resolution structure of a tRNA complex imply that tRNA aminoacylation and, implicitly, product release, reopens the monomer (Carter, 2005). In keeping with the behavior of other free-energy transducing enzyme systems (Carter et al., 2002), these domain motions are consistent with the progression of high-energy bonds linking the adenosine moiety first to the PPi leaving group, then to tryptophan, and finally from tryptophan to tRNATrp. The TrpRS conformational free energy profile was clarified by MD simulations of all three TrpRS conformational states (Figure 1 in Kapustina and Carter [2006]) (Kapustina et al., 2006). Open and Products trajectories are stable, even without bound ligands. PreTS trajectories are stable

trajectories along the reaction coordinate, unstable trajectories containing ATP all progress, untwisting toward the Products conformation (Figure 1B). Thus, bound nucleotide switches the direction along which the

structural instability is manifested, consistent with the proximity of the PreTS state to a conformational free-energy maximum. MD trajectories of the unrestrained PreTS Mg2+ATP complex in PDB ID 1M83, and with virtual mutations and/or restraining potentials demonstrated that stabilizing the high twist requires competition between Mg2+- and lysine-phosphate interactions for the nonbridging oxygen atoms (Kapustina and Carter, 2006). Bound ATP, even with Mg2+, did not stabilize the trajectory unless the Mg2+ was restrained to its crystallographic position away from the phosphates, as molecular mechanics force fields do not properly represent the delicate balance of electrostatic forces. This behavior implies an activation of Mg2+ during induced fit. We recently solved the structure of TrpRS complexed to adenosine 50 tetraphosphate (AQP) (Retailleau et al., 2007). Insertion of the b-phosphate in AQP allows the adenosine and terminal pyrophosphate to form stronger interactions, respectively, with the ribose binding site and a reconfigured KMSKS loop, mimicking a transition state with dissociative character. AQP binds 200-fold tighter than ATP in both induced fit and steady-state exchange equilibria. The enhanced AQP binding interactions that result from domain untwisting and loop movement provided a detailed structural rationale for previous mutational and presteady-state kinetic results for TyrRS (Fersht, 1987; Fersht et al., 1988; Retailleau et al., 2007). Moreover, parallel thermodynamic cycles provided by ATP and AQP affinities to different TrpRS conformations led to an experimental estimate of +3.0 kcal/mole for the allosteric constant. The free energy ``stored'' by domain movement is therefore available for transition-state stabilization as suggested, without structural details, by Fersht (Fersht, 1987; First and Fersht, 1995). Key questions remain. Are there experimental correlates of linkage between TrpRS conformation and Mg2+ coordination? Is conformational free energy stored in the twisting or hinge-bending domain motion? Is it recovered during the catalytic untwisting step? What switching interactions impose three-state behavior? How do conformational free-energy differences arise from the structures? We address these questions by measuring the effect of Mg2+ on TrpRS-ATP affinity and by simulating the bound and unliganded MD trajectories of the recent AQP-

bound structure, 2OV4. We show that PreTS and AQPbound TrpRS structures lie on opposite sides of a conformational free-energy maximum, consistent with energy storage and recovery during catalysis. Delaunay tessellation and SNAPP scoring (Carter et al., 2001; Sherman et al., 2004; Tropsha et al., 2003) implicate the high twist angle as the primary source of conformational strain. We identify side-chain packing changes in four discrete ``conformational switches'' and show that different conformational free energies arise from distributed, long-range interactions developed via molecular switching. Finally, mutation of a switch both reduces kcat and facilitates catalysis by Mn2+, thus establishing coupling between conformational switching and catalytic metal-triphosphate interactions. Our methods and results may apply to a broader class of energy-transducing enzymes. RESULTS The TrpRS RF and ABD domains provide the major binding determinants for adenosine and PPi, respectively, and their relative motion is key to catalysis. Of the two conformational angles describing relative motion (Kapustina and Carter, 2006; Kapustina et al., 2006) (Figure 1A), the hinge, a, responds to the nucleoside moiety, irrespective of whether it is covalently linked to PPi or to Trp. Crystal structures saturated with such ligands (Mg2+ATP, Trp50 AMP, and its analogs) have closed hinge angles. The twist angle, g, however, is sensitive to precise interactions with the triphosphate. Calorimetry and MD simulations both implicate coupling between the high conformational twist angle and the bent, catalytically competent PreTS Mg2+-triphosphate configuration. Stabilizing the Twist: ITC Titrations and MD Simulations ± Mg2+ Isothermal titrations with two TrpRS and ATP concentrations ± Mg2+ ion (Figure 2) show more complicated behavior than those for AQP (Retailleau et al., 2007). Simple binding models cannot be fitted for parameter estimation. However, Mg2+ induces a lateral shift of the similar profiles to higher [ATP], implying that Mg2+ weakens the TrpRSATP interaction by $0.5­1.0 kcal/mole. Mg2+ also weakens the simulated PreTS state. Trp and ATP, but without Mg2+, lead to the most stable PreTS MD

TrpRS Conformational Transition State

Unliganded AQP Complex Trajectories Progress along the Reaction Coordinate MD Trajectories of unliganded states reveal conformational energetics of the structural reaction profile. The unliganded PreTS state regresses within 2 ns to one resembling the crystallographic Open conformation (Kapustina and Carter, 2006). Bound ATP with any partial combination of the other stabilizing factors leads invariably to progression toward the Products configuration. The similarity of the latter trajectories to that presumed from the crystal structures to occur during catalysis suggests that bound nucleotide changes the free energy landscape by disfavoring return to the Open conformation and favoring the path to the Products conformation. Here, we describe new $5 ns simulations initiated from the AQP crystal structure, 2OV4 (Retailleau et al., 2007). Liganded and restrained, unliganded trajectories are stable (Figure 3B). Without the restraining potential, the unliganded AQP structure progresses rapidly toward the Products state, despite the absence of bound nucleotide. The bias toward progression, induced into the PreTS state by bound ATP, has become intrinsic to the unliganded structure in the AQP complex. Ca positions in the PreTS and AQP crystal structures ° differ by an rmsd of only 0.7 A, scarcely more than experimental error (Retailleau et al., 2001). Yet without ligands, their MD simulations relax in opposite directions. The possible paths between the two conformations must pass through a free-energy maximum for their relaxations to differ so decisively. By definition, TrpRS therefore displays a ``conformational'' transition state as it binds to the chemical transition state. SNAPP Analysis Correlates with Stability along the Structural Reaction Path Commitment of the unliganded PreTS and AQP trajectories to opposite directions provides strong evidence of functional structural differences. Side-chain packing between the two states must switch between regression and progression along the catalytic reaction coordinate. Our goal here is to find structural correlates of ``conformational switching'' and examine its mechanism. This problem is one for which there is no accepted strategy. Extracting subtle structural insight from details in MD trajectories is difficult at best. We turn instead to the static crystal structures, whose structural redundancy affords the opportunity to apply bioinformatic methods. Of the available algorithms, Delaunay tessellation has several advantages. First, it provides an unambiguous map of nearest neighbor interactions in a protein by decomposing the three-dimensional structure uniquely into its simplices. The resulting simplification reduces packing details to a level where they can be readily examined. Empirical (Carter et al., 2001) and theoretical (Bandyopadhyay, 2005) studies have shown that simplicial decomposition is also robust to small coordinate errors. Second, Simplicial Neighborhood Analysis of Protein Packing (SNAPP) (Tropsha et al., 2003) provides a virtual free-energy map of packing relations in proteins from

Introducing Mg2+ ion leads to a smaller twist angle. Ellipses indicate the range of values. (B) Trajectories for liganded and domain-restrained unliganded AQP complexes both retain a conformation close to that of the crystal structure, while the unliganded form progresses rapidly toward and beyond the product state. Removing the forcing potential (2500 ps) from the restrained trajectory leads to rapid loss of the high twist angle.

trajectory; both hinge and twist angles remain very close to crystallographic values (Figure 3A). With Mg2+, the mean twist angle falls by 15% (p < 10À5), without changing the hinge (p = 0.57). As there are no protein-Mg2+ contacts in any of the TrpRSATP complexes, competition for the phosphates weakens phosphate-lysine interactions sufficiently in the PreTS state to account for reduced ATP affinity with Mg2+; the modest magnitude of the calorimetric effect is consistent with observation of lysine-phosphate contacts in PDB IDs 1M83 and 1MAU.

the frequency of simplices with the same amino acid composition in the structural database. As three-dimensional Delaunay simplices are always tetrahedra, the ratio of observed to expected frequencies for the 8,855 possible quadruplet compositions provides a log-likelihood for each quadruplet, ijkl, Lijkl = log(fijkl / pijkl). Energyranked tetrahedra can be clustered. Further, as each side chain participates in different numbers of tetrahedra, the total SNAPP score provides a unique metric for each residue. As the logarithm of something akin to a virtual equilibrium constant, Lijkl correlates with stability measurements made on mutant proteins (Carter et al., 2001). For a series of bacterial periplasmic binding proteins, the open unliganded crystal structures have higher total SNAPP scores than the closed, liganded species, consistent with their implicit thermodynamic stabilities without bound ligands (Sherman et al., 2004). Encouraged by that precedent, we did a SNAPP analysis of 17 different structures from the TrpRS conformational cycle: open Trp (1MB2) and ATP (1MAW) complexes with six monomers; PreTS complexes with ATP (1M83) and ATP + tryptophanamide (1MAU); AQP complex (2OV4); and Products complexes (1I6K, 1I6L, 1I6M), each with a single monomer in the asymmetric unit. We evaluated pair-wise correlation coefficients between the 326-element residue-by-residue SNAPP profile vectors to assess statistical significance of structural clustering relative to coordinate errors. Next, to assess the energetic profile, we compared mean total SNAPP scores for the statistically distinct structural groups. Finally, we used regression analysis to correlate total SNAPP scores with variations in the two internal conformational angles.

Clustering Based on Profile Analysis Crosscorrelation of residue-by-residue SNAPP profiles establishes four, statistically distinct groups of structures (Figure 4A): Open, PreTS, AQP, and Products. Excepting the PreTS-AQP comparison, these differ by more than twice the standard deviation within groups, and correlation coefficients between these and the remaining structures establish that they, too, have significantly different SNAPP profiles (Figure 4A). Total SNAPP Scores and the Structural Reaction Profile Consistent with the MD trajectories of unliganded PreTS and AQP structures, these two structures have significantly lower total SNAPP potentials than the Open and Products states (Figure 4B). A parabola fitted to the DSNAPPrel values assuming unit intervals between structures passes through a maximum just before the AQP structure. Coincidence of the MD and SNAPP analyses suggests that both capture elements of the conformational destabilization documented by the experimental allosteric constant (Retailleau et al., 2007). Reduced SNAPP Scores Result Almost Entirely from the Twist Angle Structural redundancy allows us to ask whether the decreased PreTS and AQP state SNAPP scores arise from hinge closing, from twisting, or from their combination. We fitted the 17 total SNAPP scores as dependent variables to a linear combination of the two internal coordinates. The twist angle alone predicted the SNAPP score with an R2 = 0.81 and a t test Ptwist < 0.0001. R2 was unchanged when the hinge angle was added and Phinge = 0.4. Thus, the reduced SNAPP scores that correlate with PreTS state destabilization arise almost entirely from

packing changes associated with the high twist angle, as proposed (Kapustina and Carter, 2006). Delaunay Tetrahedra Rearrange during Catalysis Delaunay tetrahedra can be compared from structure to structure (Figures 5 and 6) to identify more detailed structural changes from the SNAPP analyses. Alternately, differential DSNAPP profiles can be displayed, residueby-residue (Figure 7). The two comparisons provide complementary localization of significant structural changes. Long-Range Interactions: Delaunay Simplices that Change Composition Tessellation of side-chain centroids in the TrpRS monomer produces $250 tertiary simplices (i.e., no participants adjacent in sequence). Considering just the closed structures related to the catalytic step, ie., PreTS, AQP, and Products, $75% of these simplices do not change, indicating the extent to which the catalytic step approximates rigid-body domain motion. The remaining 25% of the simplices exchange neighbors in one or both structural transitions. Surprisingly, the dominant contributions to the overall DSNAPP values in Figure 4B arise not from high-L, core simplices, but from exchanges among those with negative log-likelihoods (Figure 5). Such quadruplets occur less frequently as nearest neighbors than expected under the null hypothesis and presumably affect protein stability adversely. They border clusters of higher-L simplices at the protein surface, especially near the domain interface (compare Figures 5B and 6B and 6C). Switching Interactions A total of 70 Delaunay tetrahedra in TrpRS have SNAPP log-likelihood scores, L > 0.6. Turning to these, we find that 57­59 ($85%) are within rigid bodies and do not change as the PreTS structure evolves through the AQP structure to the Products conformation. Six high-L Delaunay tetrahedra do change composition between the PreTS and AQP states on either side of the chemical and confor-

mational transition state. These occur in four separate clusters, D1­D4, distributed around the Rossmann fold (Figure 6). The four cluster centers of mass are distant from the active site and represent long-range interactions between the active site and distal functions (the anticodon binding domain [D2, D4] and the dimer interface [D3]). Their specific rearrangements, tabulated in Figure 6A, have the characteristics of a switch: breaking and reforming similar, but alternate, configurations. All six PreTS tetrahedra change in the AQP state, which forms new compositions in three of the clusters (D1­D3) and loses D4 (containing M193 from KMSKS) entirely (Figure 6B). Six tetrahedra lost in forming the AQP complex from the PreTS state, including D4, are reformed in the Products conformation. Cluster D3 gains a tetrahedron in the AQP state that persists in the product state, and so differs between the PreTS and Products States. Curiously, it links the active site to the dimer interface, which is also perturbed in the Products state (C.W.C. and S. Lewis, unpublished data). Residue-by-Residue DSNAPP Profiles Difference profiles comprise a linear map of energetically significant structural perturbations along the sequence. SNAPP scores decrease between Open and PreTS states, and increase between PreTS and Products states (Figure 7A). Changes occur chiefly in groups highlighted in three ellipses corresponding roughly to clusters D1, D2, and D4 in Figure 6: the b strand and a helix on either side of the HIGH sequence, a group of residues from the ``bearing helix'' including L66, and residues surrounding M193 from the KMSKS signature. Similar side-chain groupings were previously identified by using graph theoretic methods (Ilyin et al., 2000). In particular, F26 and L29 (D1) and Y65 (near D2) were identified as a bearing for domain movement. Cluster D3 makes separate interactions between the tryptophan-binding site, the dimer interface, and the extreme C terminus. Changes introduced in the

Mutation of the D1 Switch Has Multiple Effects on Catalysis A Master Switch Structural hierarchy in the switching interactions suggests that they may have contributed to catalysis in ancestral class I aaRS. D1 and D4 clusters form entirely from residues within a 130-residue minimal catalytic domain (MCD) (Pham et al., 2006), suggesting that the MCD may also undergo rudimentary conformational switching related to catalysis. Later addition of the D2 and D3 clusters

may have amplified that catalytic effect in full-length TrpRS. Compositional exchange occurs between three group D1 tetrahedra suggesting that it may function as a ``master switch'' (Figures 8A and 8B). D1 lies at the corner of the first a-b-a crossover opposite the HIGH sequence and KMSKS loop, forming links to I4 in the N-terminal b strand and I140 in the Trp binding site. Three of its side chains (F26, Y33, F37) are aromatic. F26 rearranges significantly relative to F37 during induced fit, switching from F26(face)-to-F37(edge) packing (Burley and Petsko, 1985) in the open state to the energetically-preferred face-to-face stacking (McGaughey et al., 1998) as the hinge closes to form the closed states (Figure 8A). As the switching interactions represent packing combinations compatible with TrpRS's multistate behavior,

they are opportunities to use protein design to stabilize each structure along the reaction coordinate (Marvin and Hellinga, 2001; Shimaoka et al., 2000) by mutation. We therefore used the Rosetta Design program to generate stabilizing mutations for each of the three principal conformations along the structural reaction profile. Remarkably, consensus mutations suggested by Rosetta selected each residue in cluster D1 to ``hyperstabilize'' the PreTS state: I4V, F26L, L29A, Y33F, C35V, F37I, and I140Y. The F37I/Mn2+ Multimutant Thermodynamic Cycle We have constructed each of these single mutants, and various combinations, including the complete set. Results for the F37I mutation, the first we have studied, are shown in Figure 8C. We used ATP-dependent Michaelis-Menten kinetics to examine the double-variant thermodynamic cycle (Horovitz and Fersht, 1990) consisting of the F37I mutation together with substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ to probe conformational effects on both catalysis and Mg2+ coordination. Mn2+ reduces the wild-type TrpRS kcat nearly one hundred fold (Retailleau et al., 2003), reflecting (undetermined) differences in metal coordination and its catalytic effects. The F37I mutant exhibits statistically significant main and two-way interaction effects arising from altered

switching in the D1 cluster. It elevates the transition-state free energy by 1.1 kcal/mole with Mg2+, consistent with stabilization of the PreTS conformation. Unexpectedly, however, this effect is only 0.26 kcal/mole with Mn2+. The Ile substitution at position 37 substantially facilitates catalytic coordination of Mn2+, reducing the adverse effect of metal substitution from 2.52 to 1.68 kcal/mole. The mutation could: (1) reduce the destabilization of the conformational transition state and (2) flatten the energy barrier between conformations, relaxing the switching. The effect on kcat is readily explained by (1) and the interaction with the divalent metal is consistent with (2).

Transition State Stabilization via Long-Range Interactions In summary, unliganded MD trajectories initiated from the PreTS and AQP crystal structures (Figure 3B), and the DSNAPP profiles (Figure 4B) are consistent only with the existence of a higher-free energy structure between them, extending the original conclusions for TyrRS (Fersht, 1988; Fersht et al., 1988) (Figure 9A). We also implicate a unique Mg2+ATP configuration in creating this conformational free energy maximum, which occurs along

Alternate configurations of D1­D4 have nearly the same SNAPP potentials but are linked to distinct, unfavorable interactions propagating from them in the PreTS and AQP states. These properties are precisely those expected if switch-

ing interactions are broken in the conformational transition state. The conformational and chemical transition states are separated schematically in Figure 9B. Four stages are implicated: induced fit and Mg2+ activation (I), conformational switching (II), high-affinity transition state binding (III), and relocation of the KMSKS loop and the PPi binding subsite to recover the stored conformational free energy (IV).

DISCUSSION Transducing enzymes convert irreversible aqueous NTP hydrolysis into an enzyme-bound reaction whose equilibrium constant is close to unity. Doing so transiently stores the ability to do work in unfavorable protein conformations. We describe here how TrpRS implements this paradigm: the chemical transition state is recognized by a high-energy protein conformation. If not stabilized by ligands, this ``conformational transition state'' decays either backward or forward along the reaction coordinate, the choice depending on switching interactions distributed throughout the molecule. Switches are set either by binding stable ligands resembling preTS or postTS configurations or by chemical conversion of the NTP substrate during catalysis. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have not been widely recognized as transducing enzymes, although the fundamental observation that TyrRS proceeds via an ATPdependent high-energy conformation was postulated nearly two decades ago (Fersht, 1987; Fersht et al., 1988). This work breaks new ground by documenting the conformational free-energy maximum and pinpointing packing interactions that change as the conformational transition state (which must exist for any enzyme that stores chemical free energy) is traversed. We use computational geometry to distinguish between switching and de-

stabilizing interactions and show SNAPP analysis to be a valuable, high-sensitivity probe for discovering and filtering subtle changes. Finally, we illustrate conformational coupling to catalysis by the F37I/Mn2+ double variant cycle. Our results raise four questions about TrpRS catalysis. How simultaneous are the conformational and chemical transition states? Are induced-fit free-energy changes related to those establishing the catalytic Mg2+ configuration? How does the conformational transition state accelerate the catalyzed rate? Can switching itself also contribute to catalysis? We have argued (Retailleau et al., 2007) that the AQP complex captures structural aspects of the enhanced binding to adenosine and PPi moieties in the transition state for tryptophan activation. Although it captures neither the geometry of the Mg2+ ion nor the a-phosphate, AQP represents a structural analog for transition state adenosine and PPi binding because the rate-enhancing binding energies are distributed into their binding subsites, far from the scissile bond, as elucidated experimentally for TyrRS (Fersht, 1987; Fersht et al., 1988; First and Fersht, 1993b, 1995). The following aspects of the AQP complex suggest that the conformational and chemical transition states may be closely correlated: (1) it is nearly ° within experimental error (0.7 A rmsd) of the PreTS structure, so structural evolution through the transition state is both structurally and energetically minimal. (2) Its total

SNAPP potential is smallest of all structures along the profile, and packing in D1­D3 is unique, suggesting that it most closely resembles the conformational transition state. As simulation of the unliganded AQP complex progresses along the reaction coordinate, it probably approximates a post transition-state conformation. (3) The ground state active-site structure is disrupted in the AQP complex. Specifically, in the PreTS ATP complex, S194 forms a hydrogen bond with K192 and does not interact with the PPi moiety (Retailleau et al., 2007). In the AQP complex, this hydrogen bond is broken, and both component residues interact with the PPi leaving group. Loss of the D4 tetrahedron opens the KMSKS loop to improve binding interactions with the PPi leaving group, suggesting proximity to the transition state. (4) Reformation of the D4 cluster activates the KMSKS loop movement that relocates PPi. Induced fit brings the two substrates together for reaction. The weakening of ATP binding by Mg2+ suggests that it has a more subtle purpose: to activate the divalent metal. Both the bent triphosphate configuration imposed by Mg2+ and the weakening of metal-phosphate bonds are important for Mg2+ activation. There is curious agreement between the free energy stored during induced fit (3.0 kcal/mole) (Retailleau et al., 2007) and the potential of mean force estimate (PMF) for the work (Helmholz free energy, $4.3 kcal) (Kapustina et al., 2006) required to move the Mg2+ ion against the CHARMM force-field to its crystallographic position. The former measures the conformational work done to bring and maintain the lysine 3-NH2 groups within range of the Mg2+-oriented ATP phosphate oxygen atoms and achieve the correct twist angle. On the other hand, the minimum energy of the CHARMM force field reproduces the shorter Mg2+ oxygen distance observed in Mg2+phosphate coordination structures, so the PMF measures the work exerted to pull the Mg2+ sufficiently away from the phosphate groups to allow the lysines to bind. The experimental and computational free energies can therefore be viewed as alternative estimates for the work to achieve the high twist angle of the PreTS state. Thus, because lysine-phosphate and Mg2+-phosphate interactions are coupled, their approximate agreement seems more than coincidental. Two recent developments implicate conformational effects in the TrpRS catalytic rate enhancement. First, a monomeric 130-residue minimal catalytic domain (MCD) (Pham et al., 2006), roughly 20% as large as dimeric TrpRS, is only four to five orders of magnitude slower than that of the intact enzyme. The MCD contains a nearly complete active site (missing only K111) but few longrange interactions. Second, the Mg2+ ion contributes only 5 of approximately 14 orders of magnitude to the overall rate enhancement of full-length TrpRS (Weinreb and Carter, 2007). Rate enhancements of roughly nine orders of magnitude for full-length TrpRS and perhaps four to five orders of magnitude for the MCD are therefore intrinsic to the proteins themselves. The nature of these intrinsic catalytic contributions remains unresolved. Long-range interactions provided by

the additional mass of the full-length enzyme likely contribute significantly to the rate acceleration observed for the contemporary enzyme. At least two strategies could be involved: ground-state destabilization and switching via the conformational transition state. Mutation of the TyrRS KMSKS loop led First and Fersht to conclude that it prevented formation of a tight ground state ATP complex, while allowing the lysine residues to bind tightly only in the transition state (First and Fersht, 1993a, 1993b). Our results reinforce this conclusion in detail. The unfavorable induced-fit conformational free energy (Retailleau et al., 2003) destabilizes the groundstate interaction with ATP, consistent with the ITC results. The MD simulations and virtual free energy profiles in Figure 4B both also imply ground-state destabilization. Loss and recovery of the D4 cluster, weakening of ATP binding by Mg2+, the Mg2+-lysine electrostatic competition, and the (paradoxically) stronger AQPTrpRS interaction, in which substituting the b-phosphate group for Mg2+ (Retailleau et al., 2007) strengthens interaction with K192 and S194, all imply differential use of KMSKS loop binding energies before, during, and after the transition state. The TrpRS active site coordinates with Mg2+ to grasp the ATP transition state elastically, quite literally like a stretched rubber band, whose elasticity is enhanced by the longrange interactions sketched in Figures 4­7. The impact of the F37I mutation is also consistent with ground-state destabilization. Analyses both by Rosetta and by virtual mutagenesis using the MUSE algorithm devised by Cammer (Carter et al., 2001) indicate that the Ile for Phe substitution should stabilize both PreTS and Products conformations relative to the Open conformation. The mutant should, therefore, slow the reaction by stabilizing the ground-state, as observed. More extensive characterization of the designed D1 cluster mutations to determine their effect on the catalytic cycle can open a new experimental window on how long-range interactions promote catalysis. The thermodynamics of the conformational cycle arise by propagating many effects from the alternate, high-L switching interactions in core regions throughout the periphery (Figure 5B). Although perhaps counter-intuitive, this result actually makes sense. Core switching regions are composed of nonpolar side chains, all of which participate in high-L packing. Exchanging partners among these side chains will likely form approximately equivalent SNAPP potentials in alternate, nearly isoenergetic local minima capable of nucleating conformation changes whose equilibria are determined by numerous propagated effects. This work complements previous work correlating SNAPP scoring of mutations in core, high-L tetrahedra with protein stability (Carter et al., 2001) by providing the first evidence that negative-L tetrahedra are important for differential protein stability. Rates of the large conformational changes--induced fit and product relocation--are unknown and likely ligand dependent. Thermodynamic cycles of adenine nucleotide binding (Retailleau et al., 2007) suggest that PreTS TrpRS turns over without relaxing to the Open conformation and

that induced fit is relatively slow. Similar considerations apply to the subsequent untwisting. In addition to narrowing the gap between ground-state and transition-state ATP binding, the TrpRS conformational transition state imposes molecular switching between the PreTS and PostTS states. Repacking in two of the six tetrahedra in Figure 7 exchanges one partner for another adjacent in sequence along an alpha helix (V299-L300 for D2 and L134-L135 for D3), characteristic of conformational shear, a slow process, relative to hingebending (Krebs et al., 2003). Conformational switching between two quite similar conformations (PreTS and AQP) may nevertheless be more rapid than untwisting to the Products conformation and need not be rate limiting. Local free-energy minima may instead keep the respective active-site interactions from changing unless the substrate chemistry changes, that is unless the substrates proceed to or from the transition state. By discretizing the configurational space accessible to the reacting molecules, molecular switching restricts active-site ensembles more precisely to configurations related, respectively, to reactants and products. Thus, they may channel off-path chemical diffusion and enhance the rate by reducing entropy in the neighborhood of the transition state. Combining switching with exergonic relocation of the PPi-binding subsite would ensure that once past the conformational transition state, the ensemble would move rapidly to products.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES MD Trajectories Simulations of the PreTS state and its relatives were carried out as previously described (Kapustina and Carter, 2006). Force fields and molecular parameters for AQP were adapted from those used for ATP. Molecular dynamics simulations for TrpRS monomers were performed with the program SIGMA (Mann et al., 2002), by using the CHARMM27 force field. Snapshots were saved every 400 fs. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Isothermal titrations with ATP ± stoichiometric Mg2+ chloride was performed with a Microcal VP-ITC. Titrations were carried out at two different proteins concentrations (60 and 245 mM) with two different ATP concentrations (15 mM and 0.1 M). SNAPP Analysis Delaunay tessellation and likelihood scoring were done with the Procam web interface (http://staff.vbi.vt.edu/cammer/procam.html). High (L > 0.9) likelihood tetrahedra formed by nearest neighbors were extracted from the resulting kinemage files. These were then sorted on L and aligned against one another to identify differences. Residue-by-residue profiles were assembled into column vectors for the purpose of correlation analysis, which was performed with JMP (SAS, 2004). Mutagenesis The F37I mutation was constructed with the GeneTailor kit (Invitrogen). The expression plasmid pET11a containing wild-type TrpRS was methylated by DNA methylase and used as template for mutagenic PCR. Primers were designed to prime in opposite directions, with a 15­20 nucleotide overlap for efficient circularization. The PCR product was used to transform DH5a E. coli cells and plated on LB plates

with ampicillin. The resulting plasmid was sequenced to confirm the successful introduction of the mutation. Enzyme Purification The F37I mutant was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, with both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, harvested and resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 10% sucrose (pH 7.5), and rapidly frozen. The cell paste was homogenized with an EmulsiFlex C-5 homogenizer and cleared by centrifugation at 4 C. Ammonium sulfate to 30% was added to this supernatant, which was heated at 65 C 30 min with stirring. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanole (pH 7.0), loaded onto a HiTrap Blue HP Column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a 0­1.0 M KCl2 gradient. The peak fraction was dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES, with the same additions, and loaded onto a Poros HS column (Applied Biosystems) and eluted with a 0.1­1.0 M KCl gradient. Purified F37I mutant was concentrated by using an Amicon Ultra membrane and stored at À20 C in 50% Glycerol. Assays and Michaelis-Menten Kinetics PPi-exchange assays were done at 37 C and initiated with 10 ml of enzyme to 190 ml of assay mix: 0.1 M Tris-Cl, 0.01 M KF, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM Tryptophan, 70 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.0), plus 2 mM 32PPi at a specific radioactivity between 1 3 105 and 2 3 105 CPM/mM. Varying enzyme concentrations (4­400 mM) and incubation times (10­90 min) were used, depending on the activity level. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were examined by varying the [ATP] (0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 mM). All assays were processed by eluting 32PATP from charcoal with pyridine as described (Pham et al., 2006). For metal substitution assays, the mix was made without Mg2+ and treated with Chelex 100 for 30 min at 4 C to remove the trace metals and supplemented with 10 mM MnCl2. All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated, to achieve statistics cited in Figure 8C. Protein Design Rosetta design was provided with structures (1D2RA, 1MAU, 1I6L) and a list of side chains required for catalytic activity, which were not to be mutated. Redesign cycles were carried out in which residues permitted to change were allowed to mutate, and the mutant proteins were evaluated for stability by using the empirical energy function (Dantas et al., 2003). Graphics Programs Molecular illustrations were prepared with MACPyMOL (Delano, 2002). Graphs and line drawings were prepared with Kaleidagraph (Synergy, 2005) and CANVAS (Deneba, 2004).
