Abstract--Ditopic symmetrical bis(pyridyl) ligands incorporating the chiral dibenzobicyclo[b,f][3.3.1]nona-5a,6a-diene-6,12-dione cleft have been synthesised and characterised by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. The ligands, which incorporate pyridyl groups directly connected to the carbocyclic cleft core or via alkyne or phenyl linkers were accessed from palladium-catalysed coupling reactions of 2,8-dibromodibenzobicyclo[b,f][3.3.1]nona-5a,6a-diene-6,12-dione. X-ray crystal analyses show the interplanar angles between the two cleft aromatic rings in these molecules, which range from 97.80(3) to 109.80(4)  . Ó 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Oligopyridines are widely studied as ligands and building blocks in coordination and supramolecular chemistries today.1 Most prevalent are those where the heteroaromatic units are directly connected to each other via a carbon­ carbon single bond, examples include bipyridines, terpyridines and phenanthrolines. Oligopyridines of the types described are characterised by their rigid structure. In recent years, the incorporation of semi-rigid and flexible oligopyridines in supramolecular systems has also been the subject of intensive study. Typically, their structures contain a flexible alkyl bridging unit between the pyridyl groups.2 The versatility of oligopyridines as ligands is reflected in many elegant syntheses of architecturally fascinating supramolecular structures, ranging from discrete species such as polygons,3 catenanes,4 rotaxanes,5 single6 and double-stranded helices7 to extended systems, which include grids8 and wires.9 Recently, the dibenzobicyclo[b,f][3.3.1]nona-5a,6a-diene6,12-dione framework has been identified as a versatile supramolecular building block,10­12 and the applications and potential of this system in supramolecular chemistry have been reviewed recently.13 These molecular clefts can be considered as analogues of Troger's base but contain a carbo¨ cyclic core that may be elaborated to introduce additional molecular recognition groups via the ketone functional

groups. A key feature of the dibenzobicyclo[b,f][3.3.1]nona-5a,6a-diene-6,12-dione 114 is its angular or cleft-like framework that is imposed by the bicyclononane skeleton. Apart from its well-defined geometry, the cleft possesses an element of chirality as well as functional handles that allow access to new structural motifs with the potential for chiral molecular recognition processes. Thus, the carbonyl groups can be transformed to hydroxyls or oximes by reaction with lithium aluminium hydride and hydroxylamine, respectively.10,12,14 The ready access to the bisarylbromide derivative 2 also allows entry into aryl and alkynylsubstituted clefts through metal catalysed cross-coupling reactions.11

In the course of our studies towards the assembly of chiral metallomacrocycles of nanoscale dimensions, we required the efficient synthesis of bispyridyl derivatives of the clefts L1, L2 and L3 in which the distance between the pyridyl units was systematically varied. In addition, given that substituents may influence the size of the cleft angle,11,12 X-ray crystallographic analyses were undertaken to provide measurements of the cleft angle in order to gauge the likely outcome of metal complexation and self-assembly studies.

2. Results and discussion 2.1. Synthesis The target ligands L1, L2 and L3 are pyridyl, acetylenylpyridyl and p-(40 -pyridyl)phenyl derivatives of the parent molecular cleft 1. While there have been numerous recent reports and reviews on catalysts and conditions to effect metal catalysed couplings,15,16 the application of these methods to heterocycles is frequently limited and deactivation of the metal catalyst by heterocycles requires careful optimisation of reaction conditions.17 Ligand L1 was prepared by the direct coupling of the dibromo cleft 2 with (4-pyridyl)boronic acid pinacol ester under the catalysis of PdCl2(PPh3)2 (Scheme 1). The synthesis of the ligand L2 from the dibromo cleft 2 and 4-ethynylpyridine was first attempted using the protocol developed for appending alkynyl units to the peripheral arms of the cleft (Scheme 1).11 Thus, dibromo cleft 2 was treated with 4-ethynylpyridine hydrochloride, PdCl2(PPh3)2 and CuI in neat triethylamine, that is, the standard Sonogashira conditions.16 However, these conditions afforded only the homocoupled product, (4,40 -dipyridyl)butadiene 3. Use of the more active Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst under similar conditions led to the same result. Further optimisation of the reaction by the use of Pd(PPh3)4­CuI as the catalytic system and the use of organic solvents showed that in contrast to most successful Sonogashira reactions that are performed using an amine base, the choice of solvent was critical to the success of the reaction. While the use of THF and MeCN resulted in formation of the monocoupled cleft 4 in 30% and 43% yield, respectively, the desired ligand L2 was obtained in 83% yield with the use of DMF (Scheme 1).
L1

Ligand L3 contains two new biaryl bonds and hence is accessible via a number of different routes (Scheme 2). The first route investigated used Suzuki coupling of the diaryl boronic ester 5 to the dibromo cleft 2. The synthesis of the diaryl boronic ester 5 has not been reported previously, and required initial preparation of the corresponding aryliodide 11 (Scheme 3). Aniline 10,18 was converted to the iodide 11 according to the literature report.19 However, in our hands, the literature yields could not be reproduced, and careful temperature control and the use of sodium nitrite/HBF4 were required to furnish the diaryliodide 11 in only moderate yield of 44%. The diazotization step required slow addition of an aqueous solution of NaNO2 (over 1.5 h) with the internal temperature of the reaction mixture being maintained at no higher than À40  C. Iodination was effected with addition of KI also at À40  C and allowing the reaction mixture to warm slowly to rt. Purification of the crude diaryliodide 11 according to the literature procedure by recrystallisation from hot toluene was unsuccessful due to the apparent insolubility of 11. All attempts to convert the crude diaryliodide 11 to the boronic ester 5 were unsuccessful upon treatment with PdCl2(dppf)$CH2Cl2, bis(pinacolato)diborane and KOAc in dioxane or DMSO (Scheme 3).20 The alternative strategy to ligand L3 involved initial attachment of a para-substituted boronic ester to the cleft followed by introduction of the pyridyl groups (Scheme 2). The first key step involved the coupling of the dibromo cleft 2 with 4-nitrophenylboronic acid. The nitro groups serve as functional handles enabling conversion of adduct 6 to the diiodide 7, the latter being a suitable coupling partner for the subsequent Suzuki reaction with (4-pyridyl)boronic acid pinacol ester. This route failed as reaction of cleft 2 with 4-nitrophenylboronic acid under PdCl2(PPh3)2 catalysis resulted predominantly in the monocoupled product 13 under forcing conditions and long reaction times. Hence the corresponding iodide 12 was prepared via the Sandmeyer reaction of the diamino cleft 15 (Scheme 4).11 While the rate of the reaction improved by the use of the iodide 12 in place of the bromide 2, the monocoupled product 14 was the major product due to its poor solubility, which resulted in precipitation during the reaction (Scheme 5). Changing the solvent and conditions was unsuccessful, and while minor amounts of the bisnitro product 6 were formed, the extremely low solubility of this product in all common organic solvents precluded efficient purification. To avoid these problems, the alternative approach involved preparation of the more soluble bisphenol 8 via Suzuki

dard Suzuki reaction conditions,21 treatment of (4-pyridyl)boronic acid pinacol ester with bistriflate 9 in the presence of PdCl2(dppf)$CH2Cl2 (2.5 mol %), K3PO4 and KBr in dioxane gave no reaction. The use of more forcing conditions (increased catalyst loading, use of the more active Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst and prolonged reaction time) also resulted in no reaction. The failure of this reaction is most likely because of the precipitation of palladium black at the reaction onset, which results from the side reaction of the triflate with the triphenylphosphine ligand to afford phosphonium salts.21,22 Accordingly, application of the methodology of Fu et al.23 for coupling of aryl triflates and boronic acids was investigated. Following the reported optimal conditions, there was no reaction at rt using Pd(OAc)2 and PCy3 in DMF, and the successful synthesis of ligand L3 required the use of Pd(PPh3)4 and sodium carbonate in DME­H2O with heating. Purification of L3 required chromatography, followed by recrystallisation from MeOH and trifluoroacetic acid. 2.2. X-ray crystallography Single crystals of racemic L1, L2 and L3 suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained by recrystallisation from MeOH. Crystallographic details and pertinent metric details are summarised in Tables 1­3, and ORTEP depictions are provided in Figures 1 and 2. The crystal structure of ligand L1 includes a water solvate molecule that forms a hydrogen bond with L1. The crystal structure of L2 contains a disordered methanol solvate molecule, whilst the solid state

In contrast to attempted preparation of 6, the bisphenol 8 was formed in good yield and exhibited good solubility thus avoiding the problems encountered with the nitro compound. Bisphenol 8 was treated with triflic anhydride and pyridine to afford the corresponding bistriflate 9 as a suitable coupling partner for Suzuki reactions. However, under stan-

structure of ligand L3 contains two crystallographically independent molecules. The dihedral angle formed by the least square planes of the two opposing phenyl rings immediately attached to the

bridgehead superstructure, provides a simple measure of the intramolecular cleft angle. Previous analyses of 2,8disubstituted dibenzobicyclo[b,f][3.3.1]nona-5a,6a-diene6,12-dione clefts have suggested substituent effects on cleft angles, with angles of 100­104  observed for clefts substituted with electron-donating aryl groups.11 The cleft angles for L1, L2 and L3 (two independent molecules) are 97.80(3), 102.47(8), 103.30(4) and 109.80(4)  , respectively (Table 3). The single crystal structures indicate that the linker units of L1, L2 and L3 affect the overall shape of the oligopyridine clefts, though it is not clear if this reflects packing influences or electronic effects. The significantly different cleft angles found in the two independent molecules of L3 suggest that packing influences are most likely to be the cause of the cleft angle variation, though we have not yet identified any particular causal contacts. The cleft angle of 109.80(4)  observed in the second molecule of L3 is much like that which would be expected of an sp3 carbon based geometry, suggesting perhaps that this molecule is actually least affected by packing influences. Paradoxically,

the L3 intramolecular nitrogen­nitrogen distances are much ° the same at 21.35(1) and 21.40(1) (A) (Table 3), and there is no obvious explanation for this contrast to the differing cleft angles found in the two molecules of L3. The molecules of L1 and L3 pack with the apex of one molecule effectively nestling into the cleft of another, as suggested in Figure 2. In contrast, the stacking of molecules in the structure of L2 is interleaved with the terminal residue of neighbouring molecules, as shown in Figure 3. The cleft angle of L2 is between those of L1 and L3, suggesting, in contrast to early observations that this packing difference does seem to influence the cleft angle. The solid state cleft angle of any particular molecule appears to be the outcome

of subtle differences in packing and electronic influences, with no reliable systematic trend yet evident. 2.3. Metal complexation studies Preliminary metal complexation studies of the racemic ligand L1 with palladium(II) have been performed. Thus, a solution of [Pd(ONO2)2(en)] in H2O (16.7 mM) was treated with a solution of racemic ligand L1 in MeOH (16.7 mM) at ambient temperature. ESI­MS analysis of the crude reaction mixture was consistent with the formation of the [2+2] metallomacrocycle and peaks at 631 [MÀ2NO3]2+, 508 [MÀ4NO3+7MeOH]4+, 380 [MÀ4NO3+3MeOH]4+ and 284 [MÀ4NO3]4+ were detected. Due to the chirality of

the ligand L1, the formation of stereoisomers is possible. In contrast to studies with bipyridyl clefts and zinc(II) [Zn(OTf)2] where enantiomeric ligand­ligand recognition occurred,24 the 1H NMR spectrum of L1 and Pd contained multiple signals consistent with formation of several complexes. Full characterisation of these complexes therefore requires studies with the pure enantiomers, which are accessible from optically pure 2.11 Analogous results were obtained upon treatment of ligands L2 and L3 with [Pd(ONO2)2en]. These reactions were performed at more dilute concentrations due to the poor solubility of ligands L2 and L3 relative to L1 in MeOH. ESI-MS analysis of the reaction mixtures was consistent with the formation of the corresponding [2+2] metallomacrocycles. In the case of L2, peaks were detected at m/z 616 [MÀ4NO3+4MeOH+10H2O]4+ and 557 [MÀ4NO3+ 5MeOH+5H2O]4+ while for L3 peaks at m/z 833 [MÀ2NO3+MeOH+H2O]2+, 720 {2[MÀ4NO3]4+}, 660 [MÀ4NO3+6MeOH+6H2O]4+. 3. Conclusions The new dibenzobicyclo[b,f][3.3.1]nona-5a,6a-diene-6,12dione molecular clefts incorporating pyridyl, ethynylpyridyl and p-(40 -pyridyl)phenyl groups were prepared via Pd and Pd­CuI catalysed cross-coupling methodologies. The choice of solvent was critical in mediating the cross-coupling reactions, with polar solvents such as DME­H2O and DMF being required to facilitate these reactions. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the clefts confirm previous studies, which have shown that the substituents on the aryl rings affect the dimensions, and packing motifs, of the cleft in the solid state. Preliminary metal complexation studies

have confirmed that under appropriate conditions the ditopic symmetrical bis(pyridyl) ligands can be used in the assembly of chiral [2+2] metallomacrocycles. The incorporation of these ligands into the design of chiral metallomacrocycles of nanoscale dimensions is currently under investigation in these laboratories. 4. Experimental 4.1. General experimental procedures Melting points were measured on a Reichardt hot-stage and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 300 K on Bruker DPX200 and Bruker DPX300 NMR spectrometers. Low and high resolution mass spectra (EI) were obtained on a Kratos MS902 spectrometer at 70 eV. Values of m/z are quoted with intensities expressed as percentages of the base peak in parentheses. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR-8400S spectrometer. Single crystal X-ray analyses were performed on either an APEXII-FR591 diffractometer or a Bruker SMART 1000 CCD diffractometer.
