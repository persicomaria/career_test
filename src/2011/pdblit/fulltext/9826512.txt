D2.3, D2.4 and D2.5 are ester-hydrolysing antibodies raised against a phosphonate transition state analogue (TSA). All three antibody-TSA binding kinetics, as monitored by ¯uorescence quenching, indicate an ``induced-®t'' mechanism: fast bimolecular association followed by a unimolecular isomerisation (k  1-7 sÀ1). Isomerisation leads to a 30-170fold increase in af®nity towards the TSA and, consequently, to higher catalytic rates. Antibody D2.3 exhibits a complex three-step binding mechanism, in which the last step is a ``very slow'' isomerisation (k < 0.02 sÀ1). This very slow isomerisation is limiting the rate of catalysis by D2.3, as indicated by the kinetics of product release which show characteristics of enzyme ``conformational memory'' or ``hysteresis''. The results support a mechanism consisting of pre-equilibrium between ``nether-active'' (low af®nity) and ``active'' (high af®nity) antibody conformers (prior to ligand addition) as well as induced-®t, i.e. isomerisation of the nether-active ligand-antibody complex to give the active complex. Crystal structures of these antibodies, free and complexed, have previously indicated that their conformation does not change upon binding. Here, we show that the buffer used to crystallise the antibodies, and in particular its polyethylene glycol component, alters the pre-equilibrium in favour of the active conformer, leading to its crystallisation both in the presence and in the absence of the TSA.

Introduction
Structural dynamics are part of the mechanism of action of most proteins, yet in most cases their nature and function are still unknown. In enzymes, the identi®cation of conformational changes is generally elusive as they are typically much faster than the chemical step and product release (Fersht, 1985). Nevertheless, the kinetics of several monomeric enzymes are consistent with substrate-binding slowly and and shifting a ``pre-equilibrium'' between an active and a non- (or less) active conAbbreviations used: TSA, transition state analogue; TS, transition state; p, p-nitrophenyl; b, p-nitrobenzyl; catELISA, catalytic assay using ELISA; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PEG 600, polyethylene glycol Mn600; Ab Á S, less (or non-)active antibody-substrate complex; Ab ÁS*, active antibody-substrate complex; Ab, nether-active antibody conformer; Ab*, active antibody conformer.

formation of the enzyme. This mechanism, referred to as ``hysteresis'' (Frieden, 1970) or ``enzyme memory'' (Ricard et al., 1977), was veri®ed only in very few cases by independent evidence apart from irregular kinetics of product release (Ricard et al., 1977). Catalytic antibodies were originated following the notion that enzyme active sites are complementary to the transition state (TS) of a given reaction. Thus, antibodies elicited against a stable analogue of the TS may bind the actual TS of the reaction with higher af®nity compared with the substrate, and may use this binding energy to exert rate acceleration (Lerner et al., 1991). Albeit, rate accelerations exhibited by antibodies (102-106) are orders of magnitude lower than enzymes (105-1017; Kirby, 1996; Taw®k et al., 1994). This can be rationalised in several ways: the major limitation is inherited in the selection of catalytic antibodies by binding to a transition state analogue (TSA) of the reaction rather than directly for catalysing the reaction (Benner, 1993; Stewart & Benkovic, 1995).

422 has also been suggested that the type of interactions and binding site structures of antibodies are distinctly different than those of enzymes (Padlan, 1994; Jones & Thornton, 1996). In particular, the structural dynamics of antibodies might not be optimal for catalysis: antibodies elicited against TSAs might be limited by a rigid ``lock and key'' active site (Stewart & Benkovic, 1995); alternatively, the ``plasticity'' of antibodies might limit their catalytic activity (Padlan, 1994; Wedemayer et al., 1997). Conformational changes in antibodies have been examined by structural methods, mainly by X-ray crystallography but also by NMR (Martinez Yamout & McConnell, 1994), or by kinetic methods. Structural analysis of ligand-induced conformational changes relies on observing differences between the crystal structure of the free and the ligand-complexed antibody (Colman et al., 1987; Wilson & Stan®eld, 1994). However, in some antibodies, including the ones described here, signi®cant differences were not observed, thus leading to the conclusion that binding does not involve a change in the antibody's conformation (for examples, see Fischmann et al., 1991; Gigant et al., 1997; Keitel et al., 1997; Prasad et al., 1993; Wedemayer et al., 1997). The binding kinetics of several antibodies are consistent with induced-®t, i.e. fast ligand-antibody association is followed by a slow unimolecular isomerisation. Demonstrating equilibrium between two antibody conformers prior to ligand binding (pre-equilibrium) has proven more dif®cult, though a few kinetic studies (Foote & Milstein, 1994; Lancet & Pecht, 1976) and an NMR study (Martinez-Yamout & McConell, 1994) support this notion. The implications of conformational changes on the binding af®nity and selectivity of antibodies and on their catalytic activity are clearly of general interest (Davies & Chacko, 1993, Foote & Milstein, 1994; Padlan, 1994, 1996; Stewart & Benkovic, 1995; Wedemayer et al., 1997; Wilson & Stan®eld, 1994; Wirsching et al., 1991). It is, however, still unclear whether conformational changes, and in particular the existence of different conformers of the same antibody in preequilibrium, are a general feature of antibody-antigen binding mechanism (Wilson & Stan®eld, 1994). Here, we address the conformational changes in a group of catalytic antibodies. D2.3, D2.4 and D2.5 (the D antibodies) that were raised against phosphonate 1b (Figure 1) and isolated using a direct screen for catalysis (catELISA; Taw®k et al., 1993). Catalysis by the D antibodies results from their ability to stabilise the TS for ester hydrolysis as indicated in their preferential binding af®nity to the analogue of that TS (TSAs 1b and 1p) versus the substrate (2b and 2p; Taw®k et al., 1997). The variable region sequences of the D antibodies are considerably homologous (Kim et al., 1997), and so are the crystal structures of their complexes with TSA 1b (Charbonnier et al., 1997). Comparison of the unliganded structures of the D antibodies with their complexes with TSA 1b , has led to the con-

Antibodies were generated by immunisation of mice with transition state analogue (TSA) 1b, and were screened directly for catalysis of the hydrolysis of NBester 2b (Taw®k et al., 1993). Antibodies D2.3, D2.4 and D2.5 ef®ciently catalyse the hydrolysis of p-nitrobenzyl (NB)-ester (2b) and p-nitrophenyl (NP)-ester (2p) with considerable rate accelerations (103-105), turnover and substrate selectivity (Taw®k et al., 1993, 1997). The corresponding TSAs, phosphonate 1b and 1p, are potent inhibitors (Kd  1-25 nM) of this activity.

clusion that their conformation does not change throughout the reaction pathway (Charbonnier et al., 1997; Gigant et al., 1997). In contrast to the latter, we present evidence for conformational changes of the D antibodies, and examine their effect on the binding and catalytic activity of these antibodies.

Results
Substrate-induced conformational changes of antibody D2.3 A gradual increase of the initial rate of hydrolysis of substrate 2p by antibody D2.3 was observed, reaching a steady-state constant rate after several minutes (Figure 2(a)). Notably, the lag was resolved, i.e. a linear rate of product release was observed, only after multiple turnovers; for example, at 0.35 mM D2.3 (0.7 mM active catalytic sites), the lag was resolved only after 30 mM of product was released, i.e. after more than 40 turnovers (Figure 2(a)). This is in contrast with MichaelisMenten pre-steady-state kinetics that generally last one turnover (Neet, 1995; Neet & Ainslie Jr, 1980).

423 re¯ects the duration of the lag (Frieden, 1970; equation (1) in Materials and Methods); the smaller klag is, the longer it takes to reach a steady-state rate. The klag value decreases at higher substrate concentrations to a plateau value of 0.16 minÀ1 (corresponding to a t1/2 of 4.3 minutes; Figure 2(b)). This excludes the possibility that the lag observed with D2.3 is the result of a very slow accumulation of the Michaelis complex which should give rise to a large increase in klag, i.e. to the virtual disappearance of the lag, at substrate concentrations that are more than ten times above KM (Fersht, 1985; Frieden, 1970; Tipton, 1993). The kinetic behaviour of antibody D2.3 is consistent with what has been described with enzymes as hysteresis (Frieden, 1970) or conformational memory (Ricard et al., 1977), suggesting a similar kinetic model (in the simplest possible form) for antibody D2.3 (Scheme 1). According to the proposed model, the lag phase observed with D2.3 is the result of a slow, ratedetermining, substrate-induced conformational change leading from a less (or non-) active complex (Ab ÁS) to a more active complex ((Ab ÁS)*; Scheme 1). This results in shifting the equilibrium between Ab and Ab*-namely, between an antibody conformer exhibiting low af®nity towards the TSA and low catalytic activity (here, referred to as Ab or the ``nether-active'' conformer) and an antibody conformer which has higher af®nity and catalytic activity (Ab* or the active conformer). The hysteretic behaviour results from a signi®cantly slower rate of isomerisation (of both the Ab ÁS complex and the free Ab, ki and kHi, respectively) compared with the rates of substrate binding (k1[S] and kH1[S]), catalysis (kcat) and product release (Frieden, 1970; Neet, 1995; Neet & Ainslie Jr., 1980; Ricard et al., 1977; Tipton, 1993). Notably, the model and the results obtained with D2.3 (see also below) are consistent with the existence of two mechanisms acting in parallel (Fersht, 1985): pre-equilibrium, i.e. the active conformer Ab*, is present in equilibrium with the nether-active conformer Ab, in the absence of substrate or ligand; and, induced-®t, i.e. binding of the substrate to the nether-active conformer Ab, induces a change in conformation leading to a catalytically active complex ((Ab ÁS)*). The linear rate of catalysis (uf) becomes apparent when a steady-state in the concentration of (Ab ÁS)* is reached after multiple turnovers.

(b) The steady-state rate, uf, and the lag rate constant, klag, exhibited by antibody D2.3 (1.5 mM) at different concentrations of ester 2p. The steady-state rate (uf) and concentration of substrate 2p (S0) were ®tted to the Michaelis-Menten model giving a KM and umax values of 25 mM and f 7.8 mM minÀ1, respectively.

Moreover, under the same experimental conditions, product release by D2.4 (Figure 2(a)) and D2.5 was linear. The progression of product release can be described as a function of the rate observed as the substrate is added (ui) and the linear steady-state rate (uf; Figure 2(a)). The steady-state rate (uf), obeys a normal Michaelis-Menten behaviour (Figure 2(b)), thus ruling out the possibility that substrate inhibition, which is relieved after part of the substrate is consumed, is causing the lag (Tipton, 1993). The initial rate (ui) also shows saturation reaching its maximal value, which is 2.2-fold lower than the maximum steady-state rate at substrate concentrations above 150 mM. The rate constant governing the change from ui to uf, (klag),

424 Conformational memory of D2.3 A very slow rate of conformational isomerisation (ki  kÀi) corresponding to the isomerisation of the Ab ÁS complex to (Ab ÁS)*, as well as very slow relaxation (kHÀi corresponding to the isomerisation of the free Ab* to Ab) are the origins of conformational memory (Ricard et al., 1977). Thus, when the substrate (2p) was re-added to an ongoing reaction before the completion of the ®rst reaction, the active conformation still prevailed and the second reaction proceeded with no lag (Figure 3(a)). However, after approximately 15 minutes, when relaxation of Ab* to Ab was completed (i.e. the pre-equilibrium concentrations of Ab and Ab* were restored), the second reaction exhibited a full lag, indicating a minimal half-life of about 3.5 minutes for the ligand-free rate of isomerisation (kHi  kHÀi).

a Af®nity of D2.3 to TSAs 1b and 1p was determined by ¯uorescence quenching; other af®nities were derived from competitive inhibition ELISA with immobilised 5b (Taw®k et al., 1997) and corrected to the af®nity obtained for 1b by ¯uorescence quenching. b Clinear is the minimnal ligand concentration that induced a linear rate of product release, i.e. disappearance of the lag, as monitored by product release after the addition of substrate (2p; 0.25 mM) to antibody D2.3 (1.5 mM) pre-incubated (ten minutes at 22  C) with ligands at 0-20 mM concentrations. c The lag was persistent up to 5 mM TSA, at which the activity of D2.3 was fully inhibited (see the text). d Concentration of ligand was limited by absorption at 405 nm.

In addition, we found that analogues of ester substrate 2p that bind the active site of D2.3 can also shift the equilibrium in favour of the active conformer (Ab*). Competitive inhibitors with moderate af®nity are displaced by the substrate while the antibody still retains its active conformation, thus abolishing the lag phase; for example, when ester substrate 2p was added to D2.3 pre-incubated with anilide 5p (a non-hydrolysable analogue of 2p), a normal, i.e. linear, product release was observed (Figure 3(b)). The products of the antibody-catalysed reactions (3, 4p, 4b), ester 2b and amide 5b all confer the same effect (Table 1). In contrast, high-af®nity ligands (e.g. TSAs 1p and 1b), that are not displaced by the substrate (which binds D2.3 with 103-104 lower af®nity) cause only inhibition of catalysis but do not affect the lag. The minimal ligand concentrations required to abolish the lag correspond well with the binding af®nities of these ligands to D2.3 (Table 1). This indicates that these ligands (as well as the substrate) bind to the catalytic site and not to an additional ``allosteric'' site. Thus, the above results provide further support for the mechanism proposed above (Scheme 1), and in particular for the existence of an equilibrium between two antibody conformers in the absence of ligand.

The initial reaction of D2.3 (1.5 mM) with 0.05 mM of NP-ester 2p was followed for 15-30 minutes. A second aliquot of the substrate (0.05 mM) was then added and the release of p-nitrophenol (4p) monitored for an additional 15 minutes.

Conformational changes upon TSA binding The complementarity of the D antibodies active sites' to the TSA, and consequently to the actual TS of the reaction, is the primary source of their catalytic activity (Gigant et al., 1997; Taw®k et al., 1997). The mechanism of binding to the TSA should, therefore, concur with the mechanism of catalysis. We have examined the binding kinetics

of TSAs 1b and 1p to these antibodies using ¯uorescence quenching. Within a ten second time-scale, all three antibodies exhibited biphasic kinetics (data shown for D2.4, see Figure 4(a)). This data ®tted an induced ®t mechanism (Scheme 2). The ``on'' and ``off'' rates of the fast bimolecular association (k1 and kÀ1, respectively; as derived by Foote & Milstein, 1994) fall in the range of 106 MÀ1 sÀ1 and 0.25 sÀ1, respectively, for all three antibodies with TSAs 1b or 1p. As for the slow isomer-

isation, the decay time constant (1/t) dependency on TSA concentration (1b or 1p; equation (4), see Materials and Methods) resulted in rate constants of ki  6 (Æ1) sÀ1 and kÀi  0.2 (Æ0.1) sÀ1 for D2.3 and D2.5, whereas the isomerisation of D2.4 was slightly slower (ki  1 (Æ0.1) sÀ1, kÀi  0.01 (Æ0.005) sÀ1). When a longer time scale was studied, an additional very slow exponential decay was observed upon addition of TSAs 1b or 1p to antibody D2.3 (approximately 50 % of the total quenched amplitude; Figure 4(b), Scheme 3); whereas antibodies D2.4 and D2.5 did not exhibit this very slow isomerisation (Figure 4(b)). The rate constants for the very slow isomerisation are: kHH  0.8 (Æ0.1) minÀ1 and kHH  0.12 i Ài (Æ0.02) minÀ1 for TSA 1b, and, kHH  0.06 i (Æ0.02) minÀ1 and kHH  0.14 (Æ0.02) minÀ1 for Ài TSA 1p (Figure 4(b), inset). The af®nities of the D antibodies to TSA 1b against which they were elicited were found to be: 3 (Æ1), 1 (Æ0.2), 10 (Æ2) nM for D2.3, D2.4 and D2.5, respectively. The af®nities for phosphonate 1p, a close analogue of 1b (Figure 1), are, in fact, comparable (25 (Æ3), 4 (Æ1), 10 (Æ2) nM for D2.3, D2.4 and D2.5, respectively). All af®nities were measured by ¯uorescence quenching at equilbrium (see Materials and Methods).

Inset, the dependency of the apparent rate (1/t) on TSA concentration. This data was ®tted to equation (4) (see Materials and Methods) and the rate constants for the very slow, kHHi and kHHÀi (Scheme 3) were derived from this ®t.

The crystallisation buffer affects the pre-equilibrium of D2.3 Pre-incubation of antibody D2.3 in the buffer used to crystallise it (Charbonnier et al., 1997; Gigant et al., 1997) resulted in linear kinetics of product release upon the addition of substrate 2p (Figure 5). This suggests a buffer-mediated shift in equilibrium towards the active conformer (Ab*). The crystallisation buffer also inhibits the antibody catalysed reaction (uf  1.7 mM minÀ1 versus 2.7 mM minÀ1 observed with the D2.3 pre-incubated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS); Figure 5). Preincubation of D2.3 in TBS supplemented with individual components of the crystallisation buffer indicated that polyethylene glycol (PEG 600) is primarily responsible for both the lag disappearance and inhibition of catalysis.

1b; Figure 1) with similar af®nities (e.g. for D2.5, Kd(1p)  Kd(1b)  10 nM). Antibody D2.3, however, exhibits some selectivity towards the antigen (Kd(1b)  3 nM, Kd(1p)  25 nM). This selectivity is derived solely from the very-slow isomerisation (Scheme 3), unique to D2.3, tightening the ®t of the binding site to the antigen (KHi(1b)  7) yet weakening the interaction with the ``cross-reactant'' 1p (KHi(1p)  0.4). Hysteretic behaviour of D2.3 Unlike antibodies, enzymes may exhibit very slow isomerisations as re¯ected in the hysteretic behaviour reported for a number of enzymes (Baici et al., 1996; Frieden, 1970; Gibson et al., 1996; Neet, 1995; Neet & Ainslie Jr, 1980; Ricard et al., 1977; Tipton, 1993). However, very few of these reports provide a direct indication for a conformational change using a measurement which is independent of product release, e.g. by binding kinetics of a competitive inhibitor (Fersht, 1985; Ricard et al., 1977). Such support was provided here for antibody D2.3: the conformational changes of D2.3 are observed at similar rates in both catalysis, i.e. kinetics of product release (klag  0.16 minÀ1; Figure 2), as well as in binding to the TSA (kHH  kHH  0.18 minÀ1; Figure 4). In contrast, the i Ài rate of isomerisation of antibodies D2.4 and D2.5 observed upon TSA binding (ki  kÀi  1-7 sÀ1; Figure 4) is faster than the rate of catalysis (kcat 4 0.2 sÀ1; Taw®k et al., 1997) and is consistent with their normal (linear) kinetics of catalysis (Figure 2(a)). The conformational memory exhibited by pre-incubation with a diverse panel of competitive inhibitors (Table 1), con®rms that the origin of the hysteretic behaviour is in a pre-existing equilibrium between two conformations of the antibody's active site. The contribution of conformational changes to catalysis The D antibodies, as most other catalytic antibodies (Stewart & Benkovic, 1995), exhibit a tight correlation of rate acceleration (kcat/kuncat) and af®nity towards the TSA versus the substrate; for example, with antibody D2.3, kcat/kuncat  KTSA/ KS  Kd(1b)/Kd(2b)  1.1 Â 105. Since all these binding af®nities were measured at equilibrium (or steady-state in the case of rate constants; Taw®k et al., 1997), they re¯ect the properties of the active conformer of antibody D2.3. Thus, despite the fact that a direct evidence for the role of conformational changes in catalysis is available only in the case of antibody D2.3, we may assume that the higher af®nity of the D antibodies to the TSA is provided by the conformational isomerisations (30-170-fold) and is thus leading to higher rate accelerations in all three antibodies. However, in the case of antibodies D2.4 and D2.5, as in many enzymes (Fersht, 1985), the conformational isomerisation observed in the kinetics of TSA binding (Figure 4), is much

Discussion
Induced-fit increases binding affinity and selectivity Here, we have provided kinetic evidence for ligand-induced conformational changes of D2.3, D2.4 and D2.5 upon binding of the TSA. Concomitantly, we presented evidence for the existence of a pre-equilibrium between two conformers of antibody D2.3 prior to ligand binding (Scheme 1). The af®nities of the nether-active complexes of the D antibodies with TSA 1b (K1  k1/kÀ1; Schemes 1 and 2) are relatively low, about 500 nM for D2.3, 100 nM for D2.4 and 400 nM for D2.5; the af®nities of the active complexes, following conformational isomerisation, are signi®cantly higher, 3, 1 and 10 nM, respectively. The conformational isomerisations of the D antibodies, therefore, lead to a 30170-fold increase in the af®nity towards TSA 1b, and hence to a better ®t of these antibodies' active sites to TSA 1b. As the driving force for the selection of antibodies by the immune system is the af®nity towards the antigen against which they were raised (TSA 1b, in this case), the induced ®t must have provided a selectable advantage. Very slow antibody isomerisations, as indicated by ¯uorescence quenching upon antigen binding to antibody D2.3 (t1/2 of $3.5 minutes; Figure 4(b)), have not, to our knowledge, been reported. The contribution of the very slow isomerisation step on the binding af®nity of antibody D2.3 to TSA 1b is smaller (KHH  kHH/kHH  7; Scheme 3) compared with i i Ài the effect of the ®rst isomerisation step (i.e. the slow isomerisation) that increases the af®nity by 25-fold (Ki  ki/kÀi  25). The notable effect of the very slow isomerisation is on the selectivity of binding of D2.3. Antibodies D2.4 and D2.5 bind both 1b (the antigen) and 1p (a close derivative of

427 of the TSAs' phosphonate group; yet cacodylate, in the absence of PEG, does not affect the free antibody equilibrium. The limitations in identifying conformational changes by analysis of the crystal structures only (as described above) are general, not only for antibodies but essentially for any protein. Obviously, kinetic approaches have limitations as well. For example, binding kinetics can, in principle, resolve induced-®t from pre-equilibrium (Fersht, 1985) yet practical limitations often obscure the analysis (Foote & Milstein, 1994; Pecht, 1982). Regarding the dispute whether conformational changes of antibodies generally follow an induced-®t or a preequilibrium mechanism (Foote & Milstein, 1994; Wilson & Stan®eld, 1994), we wish to point out that the mechanism of binding in solution is, by de®nition, a combination of both induced-®t and pre-equilibrium. The distinction between these two mechanisms is, therefore, purely methodological; for example, when the pre-equilibrium in the absence of a ligand favours the active antibody conformer (i.e. when kH Ài > kHi, Scheme 1), the apparent mechanism (using certain kinetic methods) will be induced-®t. The evidence for pre-equilibrium in antibody D2.3 comes from the kinetics of product release, i.e. catalysis, thus obviating the limitations and complications inherited in the dissection of complex binding kinetics. Conformational changes in antibodies: general implications Since the active conformer of the D antibodies was crystallised both in the presence and in the absence of ligand, the structural characteristics of their isomerisation remain unclear. The primary structure indicates that D2.3 differs from D2.4 and from D2.5 in 12 and 14 positions, respectively (Kim et al., 1997). Of these, only three positions are conserved in D2.4 and D2.5 (both of which do not exhibit the very slow isomerisation): heavy chain H13, H82b and light chain L62. Interestingly, these positions are not in direct contact with the TSA. This is consistent with previous ®ndings that antibody conformation and af®nity may be optimised by somatic mutations in residues remote from the binding site (Wedemayer et al., 1997). The functional role of structural dynamics in antibodies is still unclear. Previous studies have led to several proposals: for example, induced-®t may provide higher af®nities (Padlan, 1994; Pecht, 1982). It was also suggested that the diversity of the primary immune response may be signi®cantly enhanced when antibodies adopt more than one binding site conformation, whereas af®nity maturation may involve the stabilisation of one of those conformers (Foote & Milstein, 1994; Wedemayer et al., 1997) or, alternatively, a better ®t induced by a conformational change (Foote & Milstein, 1994). The results presented here are consistent with a combined mechanism of induced-®t and pre-equilibrium mechanism and, therefore, provide signi®-

faster than the catalytic rate (kcat) and is, therefore, not observed in the kinetics of product release. In addition, in catalytic antibodies as well as in enzymes, the catalytic rate (kcat) is often limited not by the actual chemical step, e.g. breaking the ester bond in this case, but by product release (Taw®k et al., 1994). Conformational isomerisation may also affect the rate by facilitating product release or substrate binding (Nicholson et al., 1995; Miller & Benkovic, 1998). Notably, the D antibodies, unlike several other antibodies elicited against NP-phosphonate haptens, do not suffer from severe product inhibition (Taw®k et al., 1997); it may well be that the conformational ¯exibility is providing their much improved turnover. Antibody crystal structures versus conformations in solution The only observation that seems inconsistent with the results presented above is the essentially identical crystal structures of the D antibodies: D2.3 free and in complex with TSA 1b, substrate analogue 5b, or product 4b (Gigant et al., 1997), as well as of the 1b-complex of D2.4 and D2.5 (Charbonnier et al., 1997). Within the available resolution (which is limiting in particular for D2.4; Charbonnier et al., 1997) it has been concluded that there are no conformational changes along the reaction pathway (Charbonnier et al., 1997; Gigant et al., 1997). The origin of the discrepancy between the crystal structures and the presented solution kinetics is, in our view, in the existence of both antibody conformers, the active and the nether-active (Ab* and Ab, respectively), in pre-equilibrium, i.e. in the absence of a ligand (Scheme 2). We propose that the active conformer was crystallised both in the presence and in the absence of ligands. This conclusion is supported by the observation that incubation of antibody D2.3 in the crystallisation buffer alters the pre-equilibrium in favour of the active form (Figure 5). Our experiments suggest that the polyethylene glycol (PEG 600), commonly used for crystallisation of antibodies and many other proteins, is primarily responsible for this equilibrium shift. PEG was recently reported to interact with proteins through direct contacts (Sheth & Leckband, 1997) and its effects on conformational changes of proteins through volume exclusion have been documented (Minton, 1997). Other components of the crystallisation buffer may also induce a conformational change that is otherwise induced by the ligand or antigen (Davies & Chacko, 1993). A notable example is antibody McPC603, the crystal structures of which, free and in complex with phosphorylcholine, are essentially identical. However, a sulphate ion from the crystallisation buffer was found in the ligand-free antibody in a position occupied, in the antibody-ligand complex, by the phosphorylcholine's phosphate group (Satow et al., 1986). The crystallisation buffer of the D antibodies contains cacodylate ions which are tetrahedral and might, therefore, bind in place

428 cant support for the notion of antibody conformational isomerism (Foote & Milstein, 1994). Above all, this study demonstrates that the binding af®nity and speci®city of antibodies as well as their catalytic properties, are not determined solely by analysing the structure of their ligand-antibody complexes. The kinetics and mechanism of binding, i.e. the pathway leading from the free, uncomplexed antibody or antibody conformers, to the ligand-antibody complex play an equally important role.

Conformational Isomerism of Esterolytic Antibodies photomultiplier voltage, 700 V). For the faster phases, a stopped-¯ow apparatus was used (Applied Photophysics) at wavelengths as above; the antibody (0.1 mM in TBS (pH 8.3)) was co-injected with 1b or 1p (0.2-80 mM) and data from four to ten independent injections was averaged. Af®nities of the D antibodies to TSA 1b or 1p were determined by ¯uorescence quenching titration (Foote & Milstein, 1991) using a spectro¯uorimeter as above; all titrations ®tted a one-site homogeneous preparation.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies Antibodies were generated in mice and puri®ed on protein-A agarose as described (Taw®k et al., 1993). Antibody D2.3 was also puri®ed by af®nity chromatography on amide 5b immobilised to agarose. Amide 5b was activated (by reacting 120 mmol with N-hydroxysuccinimide (200 mmol) and 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (200 mmol) in 0.5 ml of dimethyl formamide for three hours at 4  C and for one hour at 20  C), and then added to a suspension of o-aminopentyl agarose (Sigma; 42 mmol) in 10 ml of 0.1 M NaHCO3; the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at 4  C. Ascites ¯uid of D2.3 was diluted tenfold in TBS buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl; pH 8.3) before loading on a 5b-agarose column. A gradient of guanidinium hydrochloride (1 M-4 M) was used for elution, resulting in >95 % IgG (as estimated from SDSPAGE) with speci®c activity of 80-100 % as judged by active-site titration (Taw®k et al., 1997). Kinetic assays The hydrolysis of NP-ester 2p was assayed by measuring the release of p-nitrophenol (absorption at 405 nm) using a Dynatech MR-5000 microplate reader; measurements were taken at ®ve second intervals. Stock solutions of substrate 2p (50 mM) in dimethyl sulphoxide were diluted into TBS and added to the puri®ed antibody (0.2-7 mM) in the same buffer. The antibodies were dialysed against TBS, and all solutions were equilibrated to the reaction temperature (20-22  C) prior to mixing. To examine the effect of the crystallisation buffer (Figure 5), D2.3 or D2.4 (60 ml of 8 mM active sites in TBS) was added to crystallisation buffer (180 ml of 30 % (v/v) PEG 600, 100 mM cacodylate, 40 mM sodium acetate (pH 7.5); Charbonnier et al., 1997) or to TBS (pH 7.5); 180 ml) and incubated for 20 minutes. Aliquots of the pre-incubated antibody were mixed with TBS containing substrate 2p and product release monitored as described above (the ®nal D2.3 and 2p concentrations in the assay were 1.1 mM and 0.2 mM, respectively). All the observed rates in the presence of the catalytic antibodies were corrected for the uncatalysed reaction rates in TBS. Fluorescence quenching The very slow change in ¯uorescence after the addition of a ligand (typically 10 ml aliquot resulting in a ®nal ligand concentration of 0.5-80 mM) to antibody (0.2 mM sites; in 1 ml of TBS) was monitored using a Hitachi 4500 spectro¯uorimeter at 22  C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 280 and 342 nm, respectively (slit widths, 5 and 10 nm, respectively;

Data fitting Data were analysed with Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software). Fittings were judged by the R factor (>0.999) and by residuals (random distribution of <8 %). The progression of the lag (e.g. Figure 2(a)) was ®tted to: Pt  uf t  fui À uf 1 À eÀklag t g=klag 1

where Pt is the concentration of the product (p-nitrophenol, 2p) as the function of time (t) and klag is the lag rate constant (Frieden, 1970). The steady-state-rate derived from equation (1) (uf) versus substrate concentration (Figure 2(b)) was ®tted to the Michaelis-Menten model using: uf  umax So =KM  So  f 2

Fluorescence quenching data for the resolved phases (e.g. Figure 4) were ®tted to: Ft  A Á eÀ1=tt  B À K Á t 3 where Ft is the ¯uorescence as a function of time (t, in seconds), B is the ¯uorescence at t  I (Ft  I), 1/t is the apparent rate (in sÀ1) and A is the amplitude, or the difference from Ft  0 (beginning of the slow phase) to Ft  I (A, B and F are in arbitrary units). The linear part of equation (3), namely, KÁ t-represents the background decay of ¯uorescence of the antibody measured in the absence of hapten (perhaps due to photobleaching); this contribution to the ¯uorescence decay was relatively minor (<0.1 % of 1/t). The apparent rates (1/t) of the isomerisation step, observed at different concentration of 1b and 1p, were ®tted to an induced ®t mechanism (scheme 2 and 3): 1=t  kÀi  ki 1=1  K1  4 where K1 is the equilibrium constant for the ®rst step, i.e. the fast bimolecular association (K1  k1/kÀ1; Fersht, 1985)
