The expression of histidine biosynthetic genes in enteric bacteria is regulated by an attenuation mechanism in which the level of histidyltRNA serves as a key sensor of the intracellular histidine pool. Among the early observations that led to the formation of this model for Salmonella typhimurium were the identi®cation of mutants in the gene (hisS) encoding histidyl-tRNA synthetase. We report here the detailed biochemical characterization of ®ve of these S. typhimurium bradytrophic mutants isolated by selection for resistance to histidine analogs, including identi®cation of the deduced amino acid substitutions and determination of the resulting effects on the kinetics of adenylation and aminoacylation. Using the crystal structure of the closely related Escherichia coli histidyltRNA synthetase (HisRS) as a guide, two mutants were mapped to a highly conserved proline residue in motif 2 (P117S, P117Q), and were correlated with a ®vefold decrease in the kcat for the pyrophosphate exchange reaction, as well as a tenfold increase in the Km for tRNA in the aminoacylation reaction. Another mutant substitution (A302T) mapped to a residue adjacent to the histidine binding pocket, leading to a tenfold increase in Km for histidine in the pyrophosphate exchange reaction. The remaining two mutants (S167F, N254T) substitute residues in or directly adjacent to the hinge region, which joins the insertion domain between motif 2 and motif 3 to the catalytic core, and cause the Km for tRNA to increase four- to tenfold. The kinetic analysis of these mutants establishes a direct link between critical interactions within the active site of HisRS and regulation of histidine biosynthesis, and provides further evidence for the importance of local conformational changes during the catalytic cycle.

3H ends of their cognate tRNAs. In addition to their role in protein synthesis, the levels of some aminoacylated tRNAs serve as metabolic signals to indicate the concentration of internal amino acid pools. In enteric bacteria, aminoacylated tRNAs participate in the regulation of the histidine, valine and tryptophan operons through an attenuation mechanism. In this mechanism, the levels of aminoacylated cognate tRNA control the rate of decoding for a leader peptide possessing multiple tandem codons for the amino acid under control. This rate, in turn, dictates the formation of alternative stem ±loop structures that promote either termination or antitermination of transcription.

848 As part of the classical studies investigating these mechanisms, genetic analyses were performed to identify genes in both Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli regulating these biosynthetic operons. The identi®cation of mutants in the genes for valine tRNA synthetase (valS; Eidlic & Neidhardt, 1965) and histidyl-tRNA synthetase (hisS; Roth et al., 1966) that were associated with the derepression of the valine and histidine biosynthetic operons, respectively, implicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the control of amino acid biosynthesis, but the molecular basis of their involvement was initially obscure. With the full development of the attenuation model for the trp and his operons, the role of aaRSs in amino acid biosynthesis could be rationalized (Yanofsky, 1981). In the course of their detailed genetic analysis of histidine regulation, Roth, Ames and coworkers identi®ed two classes of mutations in the gene for histidyl-tRNA synthetase associated with constitutive derepression of the his operon (Roth et al., 1966; Roth & Ames, 1966). The ®rst class of mutants recovered repression of the operon in the presence of exogenous histidine, while the second class did not. Members of the ®rst class were therefore predicted to possess defects imparting a loss in af®nity for histidine, while mutants in the second class were interpreted to suffer from defects operating at the level of Vmax. These predictions were subsequently investigated through partial puri®cation and kinetic characterization of the mutant proteins, which showed that the mutants displayed altered kinetic parameters for aminoacylation (De Lorenzo et al., 1972). As de®ned by crystallographic work and multiple sequence alignments, the aaRS can be divided into two classes, each of which possesses a characteristic active site fold and stereochemistry (strictly, the regiochemistry) of the aminoacylation reaction (Carter, 1993; Cusack, 1995; Arnez & Moras, 1997; Francklyn et al., 1997). The ®rst class is based on the nucleotide-binding (Rossman) fold, a ®vestranded parallel b-sheet that is typically interrupted by two insertions of variable length. Enzymes in this class tend to aminoacylate the larger, more hydrophobic amino acids, and many possess editing functions. Representative crystal structures include GlnRS, MetRS, TyrRS, GluRS and TrpRS (Rould et al., 1989; Zelwer et al., 1982; Â Brick et al., 1989; Nureki et al., 1995; Doublie et al., 1995). The second class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is based on a catalytic domain consisting of a six-stranded, antiparallel b-sheet ¯anked by three a-helices, which is interrupted by insertions of variable length (Cusack et al., 1990; Eriani et al., 1990). Crystal structures of class II aaRS include those of SerRS, AspRS, LysRS, PheRS, GlyRS and HisRS (Cusack et al., 1990; Ruff et al., 1991; Onesti et al., 1995; Mosyak & Safro, 1993; Logan et al., 1995; Ê Arnez et al., 1995; Aberg et al., 1997). In both classes, accessory domains of several distinct fold types are joined to the catalytic domains, and these clearly provide speci®city for the binding of tRNA

Catalytic Defects in Histidyl-tRNA Synthetase

(Rould et al., 1989, 1991; Ruff et al., 1991; Biou et al., 1994). The diversity in accessory domains is mirrored in the idiosyncratic nature of tRNA recognition, so that various systems rely on contacts to the tRNA anticodon, acceptor stem and other features to different extents (Saks et al., 1994; McClain, Â 1993; Giege et al., 1993). The two distinct catalytic folds also impose a number of speci®c constraints on substrate binding and catalytic mechanism. In both classes, activation of the amino acid apparently occurs by an in-line attack of the amino acid a-carboxylate group on the a-phosphate (Harnett et al., 1985; Langdon & Lowe, 1979). However, the two classes differ with respect to the geometry of the ATP molecule, which is dictated by interactions with signature sequences in the two classes. In class I enzymes, the extended conformation of ATP is maintained by contacts to the HIGH and KMSK peptides (Perona et al., 1993). By contrast, the bent conformation of ATP in class II enzymes is maintained by interactions with motif 2 and motif 3 (Cavarelli et al., 1994; Belrhali et al., 1995; Arnez et al., 1997). There are also at least two different arrangements of magnesium ions found in the active sites of class II enzymes (Belrhali et al., 1995; Arnez et al., 1997). Finally, the two classes differ with respect to the regiochemistry of aminoacylation, with class I enzymes esterifying the 2H OH group of A76 and class II enzymes esterifying the 3H OH group (Arnez & Moras, 1997). With detailed structural information from complexes of aaRS and their substrates now available, the more dif®cult question of how substrate recognition and catalysis are coupled can now be addressed. The histidine system presents an excellent opportunity to address these issues, as recent crystallographic work has de®ned the interactions with histidine and ATP, and elements of the tRNA required for recognition have been well characterized (Himeno et al., 1989; Francklyn & Schimmel, 1990; Nameki et al., 1995; Yan & Francklyn, 1994). The crystallographic complexes include enzyme: Ê histidine (Aberg et al., 1997), enzyme:histidinolATP (Arnez et al., 1997) and enzyme:histidyl-adenÊ ylate complexes (Arnez et al., 1995; Aberg et al., 1997), allowing a full description of the contacts to both ATP and to histidine during the activation reaction. As a complementary approach, molecular genetics can serve to identify functionally important residues, and is free of the bias imposed by knowledge of the three-dimensional structure. Along these lines, hisS mutants isolated during early work on the histidine system (Roth et al., 1966; Roth & Ames, 1966) offer the opportunity of providing new insights into HisRS function, so biochemical analyses of a number of these were undertaken. These studies provide a structural rationale for the two classes of hisS mutants described in the early work, and highlight the importance of the HisRS motif 2 loop and insertion domains for catalysis.

849 synonomous codon changes. The 16 amino acid substitutions are distributed nearly randomly throughout the protein, except that fewer residues are substituted in the ®rst 300 residues (seven changes) than in the last 124 residues (nine changes). This is consistent with the overall higher level of sequence conservation in the amino terminus of HisRS relative to the C terminus (Arnez et al., 1995). With the exception of the substitution of Cys130 by alanine, the substitutions are generally conservative, with amino acids being replaced by their close chemical relatives. When mapped onto the E. coli structure, the polar substitutions invariably consisted of solvent exposed residues. Five different mutant alleles of hisS were characterized by sequence analysis (Figure 1). In each mutant gene, a single mutation was found encoding an amino acid substitution. Two of the mutants predicted coding changes at a single residue, Pro117. The gene for hisS2280 was identical with the wild-type gene, except for the single substitution of C349 by thymidine, encoding the substitution of proline by serine. The hisS1219 allele was found to have the substitution of C350 to A, encoding the substitution of proline by glutamine. The three remaining mutants encoded unique substitutions that also were single point mutations. The hisS1210 mutant had a single mutation, C499 to T, encoding the substitution of Ser167 by phenylalanine. The hisS1524 mutant contained the transition mutation of G904 to A (encoding Ala302 to Thr), while the hisS1816 mutant possessed a single transversion mutation A760 to C, encoding Asn254 to threonine. Protein expression and intracellular levels of the mutant proteins The genes for the wild-type S. typhimurium HisRS and the mutant alleles were subcloned into plasmid pQE30 to allow expression and puri®cation of the mutant proteins. In this expression system, an af®nity tag of six tandem histidine residues is encoded at the amino terminus to allow puri®cation by nickel af®nity chromatography. Previously, we have shown that the presence of this tag does not signi®cantly affect the function of HisRS (Yan et al., 1996; Augustine & Francklyn, 1997). The six histidine residues serve also as an epitope tag to allow the intracellular concentrations of the mutant proteins to be determined immunologically. Crude extracts were prepared from uninduced JM105 cells carrying the expression plasmids, and the af®nity-tagged HisRS proteins were detected by use of a His6-speci®c antibody. An immunoblot analysis of the individual levels of the mutant proteins relative to the wild-type E. coli and S. typhimurium proteins showed that each of the mutant proteins accumulated to levels that were only two to threefold lower, on average, than the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the mutations do not impart an increased susceptibility

Results
History of the mutant collection The hisS mutants characterized here were isolated in early work on the histidine system (Roth & Ames, 1966; Roth et al., 1966; De Lorenzo et al., 1972), long before the nucleotide sequence of hisS from E. coli was reported (Freedman et al., 1985). The genetic selections that led to the isolation of these mutants relied on the unusual properties of two histidine analogs, 1,2,4 triazole 3-alanine (TRA) and 3-amino 1,2,4 triazole. TRA is a weak substrate for HisRS, but can nonetheless be incorporated into protein. In wild-type cells growing on minimal medium, the internal histidine pool is large enough to prevent TRA from inhibiting growth by virtue of its incorporation into protein, even without derepression of the synthesis of histidine biosynthetic enzymes. However, sensitivity to TRA can be induced by decreasing the size of the internal histidine pool, either genetically through a leaky mutation in the hisH gene product encoding the glutamine amido transferase, or metabolically by the inclusion of 3-amino 1,2,4 triazole, which inhibits the imidazoleglycerol phosphate dehydratase (hisB). In order for cells to overcome the inhibition by TRA under these latter conditions, partial derepression of the his operon must occur. Among the many analog-resistant mutants isolated in numerous his genes (including hisR, hisD, hisT and others) were a number that map to the hisS locus, including hisS1210, hisS1219, hisS1524, hisS1816, hisS2280 and hisS1524 (Roth et al., 1966). The mutants all shared linkage to hisS, constitutive derepression of histidine biosynthesis, and reduced speci®c activity of HisRS in crude extracts. Analysis of the deduced amino acid substitutions corresponding to these mutations might be expected to provide insights into mechanisms for substrate selection by aaRS. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the wild-type and mutant hisS genes In order to characterize the wild-type and mutant genes, genomic DNA was prepared from each of the Salmonella strains and then used as template in a PCR reaction. Ampli®cation of the hisS genes was accomplished using primers based on the 5H and 3H untranslated sequences of the hisS gene from E. coli. These were subsequently replaced with primers based on the S. typhimurium gene as sequence data were accumulated. The sequence analysis of the wild-type gene (S. typhimurium LT-2) showed that, as expected from the close relationship of the two enteric bacteria, the hisS genes are 88% identical at the nucleotide level and 97% identical at the level of primary amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequence differences are concentrated at the third base of the codon (less frequently at the ®rst base), leading to a relatively high proportion (135/424 codons) of

850 to proteolysis originating from a loss of global folding (Figure 2). A detailed calorimetric analysis of the thermodynamics of the various mutants has not been carried out, and the possibility that one or more of the mutations causes a more local change in folding or stability remains to be investigated.

Kinetic analysis of the mutant proteins The kinetic properties of the mutants were analyzed using the pyrophosphate exchange and aminoacylation assays. The Michaelis constants for ATP and histidine were determined from the pyrophosphate exchange assay, while that of tRNA was

obtained from the aminoacylation reaction. As determined from pyrosphosphate exchange, the kinetic parameters for wild-type HisRS from Salmonella were quite similar to those of the E. coli enzyme, except that the Km for histidine was found to be increased threefold (Table 1). The values of the apparent Michaelis constant for histidine and ATP were 87 and 641 mM, respectively, which are close to the values of 125 and 831 mM reported previously for HisRS from S. typhimurium (Di Natale et al., 1974). The mutant proteins exhibited values of kcat/Km that were decreased ®ve to tenfold relative to the wild-type protein, with decreases in kcat for exchange, increases in the apparent Km for histidine or ATP, or combinations of these effects (Table 1). For three of the mutants, P117S, P117Q and N254T, the decreases in activity were nearly all due to reductions in the kcat parameter, which

was reduced ®ve- to tenfold with respect to wildtype HisRS. By comparison, the values of Km histidine and Km ATP were within a factor of 2 of the respective Michaelis constants for the wild-type enzyme. The one noteworthy exception was the N254T mutant, which showed a two- to threefold decrease in Km for ATP. Thus, the primary effect on HisRS function in at least three of the mutant proteins was a decrease in the rate of the reaction, as opposed to the af®nity for substrates. By contrast, the A302T and S167F mutant proteins showed more distinct differences from wildtype HisRS with respect to PPi exchange activity than the mutants described above. In the case of A302T, a tenfold increase in the Km for histidine was observed that was not accompanied by any change in either the Km for ATP or kcat of the reaction (Table 1). To a ®rst approximation, the A302T substitution exerts a speci®c effect on histidine

binding with minimal impact on the recognition of ATP and the catalysis of the reaction. The S167F mutant protein exhibited an eightfold increase in apparent Km for ATP and a sixfold decrease in kcat for pyrophosphate exchange. The 40-fold decrease in kcat/Km for pyrophosphate exchange observed for S167F indicates that this mutant is the most severely compromised of all the mutants for adenylation. Aminoacylation assays were carried out using puri®ed wild-type and mutant S. typhimurium proteins and tRNA transcripts based on the sequence of E. coli tRNA, which is identical with the sequence of tRNAHis from mutant S. typhimurium (Steinberg et al., 1993). The kinetic parameters for aminoacylation by the mutant S. typhimurium wildtype enzyme were within twofold of those of the wild-type E. coli enzyme, consistent with the high

degree of sequence identity shared by the two enzymes (Table 2). The value of apparent Km for tRNA determined here is substantially higher than that determined in early work (1.5 mM versus 110 nM; De Lorenzo & Ames, 1970). While the assays conducted here were performed using in vitro transcripts based on the sequence of tRNAHis, the early kinetic determinations were determined using unfractionated total tRNA with a relatively low speci®c histidine acceptance (15 pmol/A260). This raises the possibility that tRNA modi®cations might be important in the histidine system for high-af®nity binding. However, we have carried out aminoacylation assays using preparations of E. coli tRNA enriched in tRNAHis (330 pmol/A260) and have measured values of Km that are similar to those of the transcripts. The mutant proteins all showed reductions in aminoacylation kinetics, with two distinctly different types of kinetic behavior being observed. The A302T mutant protein exhibited a sixfold reduction in the rate of aminoacylation and a sixfold increase in Km for tRNA. However, these assays were conducted at 22.5 mM histidine, which is threefold less than the Km for histidine measured in the PPi exchange reaction (Table 1). In the presence of higher amino acid concentrations and saturating tRNA concentrations, the kcat approaches that of wild-type (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the major defect in A302T HisRS is in histidine binding, and other functions are substantially less affected. The four other mutant proteins (P117S, P117Q, N254T and S167F) were more similar in their kinetic behavior, which was distinct from that of A302T. For P117S, P117Q and N254T, plots of Vmax/E0 versus [tRNA] were linear up to 20 mM tRNA, such that saturating velocities could not be obtained. Therefore, only kcat/Km can be estimated with any accuracy. Using the values of Vmax/E0 determined at the highest tRNA concentrations as approximations of kcat, the Km for tRNA estimated for these mutants were of the order of 20 mM (Table 2). For the P117S/Q mutant proteins, the values of Vmax/E0 determined at 20 mM tRNA

PPi exchange reactions were performed at 37 C as described in Materials and Methods. Enzyme concentrations determined from active site titrations were chosen to give linear initial rates. Velocities were determined from initial rate plots by linear regression. Kinetic parameters and standard errors were calculated from at least two data sets using the programs Enz®tter (Elsevier) and Kaleidagraph to perform non-linear ®ts to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Apparent kinetic parameters for the aminoacylation of wildtype tRNAHis were determined by measuring the rates of charging with varying amounts of enzymes. Kinetic parameters and standard errors were determined as described for Table 1. a For these mutant proteins, values of kcat and Km could not be determined individually, because plots of V/E0 versus [tRNA] were linear past concentrations as high as 20 mM. b For technical reasons, apparent kinetic parameters for aminoacylation of tRNA are determined at a concentration of 22.4 mM in [3H]histidine, which is likely to be below saturation for this mutant, but not for the wild-type or other mutants. c Determined over a tRNA concentration range of 0.6 to 20 mM, hence the parameters are only estimates.

were within a factor of 2 of the wild-type HisRS, suggesting that these mutants possess reduced tRNA-binding function but can aminoacylate at near wild-type rates when saturated with tRNA. Saturating velocities could not be obtained with the S167F mutant over the tRNA concentration ranges tested, but ®tting of the data to the Michaelis Menten equation gave an apparent Km for tRNAHis of 26 mM and a kcat of 2.4 sÀ1. These values have to be considered as estimates, owing to the tRNA concentration ranges employed. For this mutant, the major kinetic effect appears to be on tRNA binding. By contrast, the value of Vmax/E0 exhibited by the N254T mutant at the highest tRNA concentration tested was nearly tenfold lower than the other mutants, suggesting that this mutation also exerts an effect on catalysis in addition to tRNA binding.

Discussion
Early work by Roth & Ames (1966) suggested that mutants in hisS defective in biosynthesis control would fall into two classes, the ®rst comprising those possessing defects in histidine binding and a second characterized by decreased aminoacylation velocity. The mutant analysis presented here con®rms those predictions, and pinpoints the active site residues responsible for these catalytic defects (Figure 3). The hisS1524 mutant was revealed to encode the substitution of a residue (Ala302) in direct contact with Tyr288, which forms the back wall of the histidine-binding pocket (Figure 4(a)). Kinetic analysis of this mutant showed that the defect raises the apparent Km for histidine at least tenfold, with less of an impact on the parameters for interactions with other substrates (Tables 1 and 2). The other four mutants characterized in this study (hisS2280, hisS1219, hisS1210 and hisS1816)

all showed evidence of reduced tRNA binding, but little or no change in the apparent Km for histidine. Both hisS2280 and hisS1219 are only partially repressed by exogenous histidine, suggestive of reduced af®nity for tRNA (Roth & Ames, 1966). At the intracellular concentrations of tRNA that have been measured for enteric bacteria (Jakubowski & Goldman, 1988), the increase in Km for tRNA would have the effect of decreasing the maximal velocity of aminoacylation catalyzed by these mutants. The close agreement between the early work and the results of the functional analysis performed here illustrates the direct connection between HisRS catalytic function and the regulation of histidine biosynthesis. The mutations characterized here identify several key structural elements of the HisRS active site domain involved in catalytic function, including the motif 2 loop, the a-helical insertion domain, and the amino acid binding pocket (Figure 4(a) to (d)). Notably, the mutations apparently have little effect on stability in vivo (Figure 2), suggesting that the catalytic defects are the result of direct effects on local elements of structure. Among the critical regions affected is the motif 2 loop, whose importance for ATP-binding in the seryl and aspartyl system has been demonstrated in crystallographic work (Cusack et al., 1990; Delarue et al., 1994; Poterszman et al., 1994; Belrhali et al., 1995). In HisRS, comparison of three crystal structures describing the amino acid activation reaction suggests that the motif 2 loop is largely unstructured in the absence of substrates, but adopts a ®xed hairpin conformation upon binding ATP Ê (Arnez et al., 1997; Aberg et al., 1997).

collection suggests that this side-chain either participates in direct substrate contacts, or plays a structural role in preserving the motif 2 loop mainchain conformation. Based on the similar catalytic properties of the P117S and P117Q mutants (Tables 1 and 2), the possibility of direct interactions appears to be less likely. Proline 117 may therefore serve to properly position nearby conserved residues (such as Arg113, Glu115, and Arg121) to permit their participation in both the adenylation and aminoacylation reactions (Figure 4(b)). Arg121 and Glu115 both undergo conformational changes during the adenylation reaction, which orient them for subsequent tRNA binding, a process likely to be stimulated by the release of pyrophosphate. Although the order of substrate addition has not been rigorously established for the histidine system, preliminary ®lter-

binding and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments indicate that the presence of bound adenylate increases af®nity for tRNA (M. Bovee, J.A. & C.F., unpublished results). Therefore, the presence of Pro117 may facilitate this conformational change, which is re¯ected in its apparent conservation in the related class II GlyRS and ProRS (Figure 5). A similar conformational change has been proposed for SerRS on the basis of crystallographic studies (Cusack et al., 1996). These results and apparent sequence conservation argue that the motif 2 loop is a crucial switch element for at least one subgroup of the class II aaRS, and provides structural linkage between the adenylation and aminoacylation reactions. Two of the mutants (S167F and N254T) are located in or near the a-helical insertion domain (residues 183 to 231), and their kinetic properties

Figure 5. Multiple sequence alignment of motif 2 loop sequences from representative HisRS, GlyRS and ProRS from various organisms. The strongly conserved proline residue is marked in bold. The residue numbers that bracket the motif 2 loop sequences of the various enzymes are indicated. The endpoints of the b-strands are based on the lengths of corresponding strands in E. coli HisRS. The abbreviations used and the SWISSPROT accession numbers are as in Figure 1 with the following additions: GrsHs: GlyRS, H. sapiens (P41250); GrsSc, S. cerevisiae (P38088), GrsMg, Mycoplasma genitalium (P47493); GrsCe, C. elegans (Q10039); Grs, Bombyx mori (Q04451); PrsCt Chlamidia tracomatis (P36431), PrsHa H. in¯uenzae (P43830); PrsEc E. coli (P16659).

are consistent with this domain contributing important tRNA contacts (Figure 4(c) and (d)). This domain is partially disordered in the E. coli HisRS structure (residues 178 to 228), but could be traced in the structure of HisRS from Thermus thermophilus Ê (Aberg et al., 1997). Interactions from basic sidechains common to the insertion domains of all HisRS family members may serve to position the tRNA CCA trinucleotide in the active site, and may account for the ability of HisRS and some other class II aaRS to aminoacylate mini- and Ê microhelix substrates, as proposed by Aberg et al. (1997). In the E. coli crystal structure, Ser167 is involved in packing interactions in the ``hinge'' portion of the insertion domain, with a role in stabilizing the main-chain conformation of residues 167 to 169. The phenylalanine residue introduced as a consequence of the S167F mutation may create a favorable stacking interaction with Phe266, decreasing the mobility of the insertion domain during catalysis. Conformational changes in this domain could serve both to properly position CCA during the ®nal stages of tRNA binding, and allow release of the aminoacylated tRNA product. Asparagine 254 may similarly stabilize main-chain conformation, imposing structural constraints on the region of the His A loop (residues 254 to 275), which is also the site of important binding and catalytic residues. Although different conformations of the His A loop have been proposed to occur Ê during aminoacylation (Aberg et al., 1997), the structures currently available provide few clues about the role of Asn254 in tRNA binding. These proposed conformational changes in the motif 2 loop, the insertion domain, and the His A loop would all be predicted to have signi®cant implications for the binding of tRNA. This is in contrast to the structural elements involved in amino acid binding, especially the highly conserved b-strand of motif 3 in which Ala302 is located. The minimal effect on ATP and tRNA binding observed with the A302T mutant suggests that any local structural perturbations (e.g. a steric clash between the introduced threonine residue and Tyr288) are restricted to the amino acid bind-

ing pocket. In this regard, the A302T mutant is functionally analogous to other motif 3 mutants of class II aaRS that have been reported, whose catalytic defects predominantly involve amino acid recognition. For example, substitutions at an alanine similarly located on the glycine-rich strand of motif 3 in PheRS reduced the ability of the enzyme to discriminate against ¯uorinated derivatives of phenylalanine, consistent with the location of this residue in the proposed phenylalanine-binding pocket (Ibba et al., 1994). Similarly, substitutions of key motif 3 residues in yeast AspRS and E. coli ProRS bring about a large increase in the Km for the cognate amino acid in their respective systems (Cavarelli et al., 1994; Stehlin et al., 1997). The studies reported here and the early work from which they gain their inspiration illustrate how, in enteric bacteria, the activity of HisRS in vivo serves to regulate the expression of histidine biosynthesis genes, linking the activity of the enzyme to the availability of one of its substrates. Remarkably, the involvement of enzymes possessing HisRS-like domains in amino acid biosynthesis regulation is not restricted to enteric bacteria, and other regulatory models have been described that are distinct from the classical attenuation mechanism described by Yanofsky et al. (1981). One of the best known of these is the translational control mediated by the GCN2 kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hinnebusch, 1997). In response to elevated levels of uncharged tRNA arising through amino acid starvation and other stress signals, GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2a, promoting increased translation of the general transcription factor GCN4. These GCN2 activities are mediated by a serine-threonine kinase domain that is fused to a domain with considerable sequence identity with the yeast histidyl-tRNA synthetase (Wek et al., 1989). This latter domain has been shown to confer the ability to recognize uncharged tRNA (Zhu et al., 1996). More recently, a HisRSlike protein has been identi®ed within the his operon of Lactococcus lactis, where it apparently participates in the regulation of his operon expression (Renault et al., 1995). The involvement of proteins

856 containing the HisRS fold in a diverse set of regulatory mechanisms associated with the control of amino acid biosynthesis is intriguing, and raises questions about the evolution of the aaRSs and the role of tRNA in translational control.

Catalytic Defects in Histidyl-tRNA Synthetase DNA sequencing using an ABI 381 DNA sequencer. Two independent clones for each mutant were sequenced to con®rm putative mutations. Later, additional sequencing on the PCR products directly was carried out to provide further con®dence in the mutant nucleotide changes identi®ed. For all mutants, both strands were sequenced and any results obtained by subcloning PCR products were con®rmed through multiple independent isolations. Protein expression and purification The wild-type and mutant S. typhimurium proteins were overexpressed and puri®ed by the use of the QIAExpress System (Qiagen) utilizing Ni-NTA agarose chromatography, facilitated by the His6 fusion tag. The plasmids for overexpression were constructed by PCR ampli®cation of genomic DNA using speci®c primers based on the 5H and 3H coding sequences of the S. typhimurium LT-2 gene. The primer sequences were 5H CATGCCATGGATCCATCGAGGGAAGGGCAAAAAACATTCAAGCCATTC-3H for the 5H end and 5H -TGAAGCTTCCTTTAGCCCAGTAAAGTGCGCAAATGCGCG3' for the 3H terminal primer. These primers encode BamHI and HindIII (underlined) sites, respectively, to allow cloning into pQE30. The E. coli JM105 cells carrying the appropriate HisRS plasmids were grown in rich medium to log phase at 37 C before induction by 1 mM IPTG for four hours. The proteins were puri®ed by liquid chromatography using published procedures (Yan et al., 1996; Augustine & Francklyn, 1997) on NickelNTA agarose, followed by a second puri®cation step on hydroxyapatite. The concentration of some mutant enzymes was determined by active site titration (Fersht et al., 1975). The concentration of active enzymes determined by this method were in good agreement with the amount calculated on the basis of the molar extinction coef®cient (127,097). PPi exchange assay Inorganic pyrophosphate exchange reactions were performed according to Calender & Berg (1966). Assay reactions contained 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM KF, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM [32P]NaPPi, 500 nM HisRS and concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mM histidine and 10 to 2000 mM ATP. Saturating concentrations of histidine and ATP were 2 mM. For the S167F mutant, a greater concentration range of ATP (0.2 to 10 mM) was employed. Reactions (1 ml) were incubated at 37 C for up to 20 minutes and quenched with four volumes of 7% perchloric acid containing 10 mM NaPPi. Activated charcoal was added, and [32P]ATP was separated by ®ltration through glass ®lter pads (Whatman). In vitro aminoacylation assays Aminoacylation of selected tRNAHis transcripts by the wild-type and mutant proteins was carried out as described (Yan et al., 1996; Augustine & Francklyn, 1997). The tRNA transcripts were prepared by in vitro transcription from linearized plasmid template followed by puri®cation from denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Standard aminoacylation reactions were performed in a buffer containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 8.3 mM DTT, 2.5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 22.4 mM [3H]histidine and varying amounts of enzyme and tRNA. The reactions were incubated at 37 C and terminated by quenching

Materials and Methods
General methods and materials Phage T7 RNA polymerase was puri®ed from strain pAR1219/BL-21 by the method of Grodberg & Dunn (1988). Restriction enzymes and other molecular biology reagents were obtained from New England Biolabs or Boehringer and were used according to manufacturer's protocols. The Ni-NTA af®nity resin was purchased from Qiagen. Bacterial strains The Salmonella strain LT-2 was used as the wild-type strain for these studies. The mutant strain hisS2280 was obtained from B. Ames, and strains hisS1524, hisS1210, hisS1219 and hisS1816 were obtained from J. Roth. The bacterial strains hisS1210, hisS1219 were isolated in a S. typhimurium LT-2 hisH107 background using ultraviolet light as the mutagen and TRA resistance as the basis of the selection. The hisS1816 mutant is based on the same background and was isolated with diethyl sulfate as the mutagen. The hisS2280 strain was isolated in the LT-2 background from a selection with triazolealanine plus aminotriazole. No information about the origin of the hisS1524 mutant was available. These strains were routinely grown in LB medium for the preparation of genomic DNA and cell extracts for crude enzyme assays. Bacterial strain JM105 was used as the background for the expression of all HisRS proteins. Cloning and sequencing of hisS alleles Genomic DNA was prepared from stationary-phase cultures by cell lysis with SDS and Proteinase K, followed by selective precipitation of cell-wall debris and remaining contaminants using cetyl triethylammonium bromide and sodium chloride. After three rounds of extraction with phenol and phenol/chloroform, the DNA was precipitated with isopropanol. The hisS gene from the wild-type S. typhimurium LT-2 strain was ampli®ed by the PCR using primers complementary to the 5H [CCGGAATTCCGAAACAATTGAGGGAAGCGTTGAGGGTTC] and 3H [ CCGGATCCAAATTTCCACGCTGTCCTTCTCCTTCCTTA] untranslated regions of the E. coli hisS gene. These primer sequences encoded unique EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, at their 5H ends. Use of these primers in a typical PCR protocol (one minute at 95 C; one minute at 45 C, two minute extension at 72 C for 35 cycles, followed by a ®nal ten minute extension at 72 C) gave a 1348 nucleotide product for the hisS gene from S. typhimurium LT-2 and all of the mutant strains. The sequence of the wild-type gene was established before work on the mutants was initiated. (The nucleotide sequence of the wild-type LT-2 gene has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number AF047040.) In the early stages of the project, EcoRI ± BamHI restriction fragments derived from the mutant hisS genes were cloned into the corresponding unique restriction sites of M13 mp18 and mp19, and then sequenced by ¯uorescent dye-terminated dideoxy

Catalytic Defects in Histidyl-tRNA Synthetase with trichloroacetic acid-soaked 3MM ®lters (Whatman). The speci®c activity of the tritiated amino acid was corrected for the variation in scintillation counting ef®ciency for the free amino acid versus amino acid esteri®ed to the tRNA (Francklyn et al., 1992). Western blotting Western blot analysis of sonicated cell lysates of the HisRS constructs was carried out as described (Augustine & Francklyn, 1997). Brie¯y, equivalent amounts of protein from uninduced cell lysates were separated on a SDS-12.5% PAGE gel and transferred to Schleicher & Schuell Nytran membranes. Mousederived MRGS Á His antibody (Qiagen) was used for detecting recombinant proteins containing the epitope MRGS(His)6. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Pierce) was incubated with the immobilized MRGS ÁHis antibody. Subsequent addition of Renaissance Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent (DuPont) allowed protein visualization by autoradiography.
