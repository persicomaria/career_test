Abstract 1,3-Butadiene is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 2E1 to several epoxides that are considered toxic and carcinogenic. The first step of BD metabolism is oxidation to 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), a reactive metabolite. It has been shown that P450s can be inactivated by covalent binding of reactive metabolites to protein or heme. Molecular dosimetry studies have clearly shown that BD metabolism follows a supralinear dose response, suggestive of saturation of metabolic activation. In this study, potential binding sites of EB in human P450 2E1 were identified and modeled to test whether EB covalently binds to residues important for enzyme activity. Commercially available human P450 2E1 was reacted with EB, digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization tandem Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The identity of EB modified peptides was confirmed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS) sequencing. It was shown that EB binds to four histidine and two tyrosine residues. All modification sites were assigned by at least two adjacent and a minimum of eight peptide specific fragments. Protein modeling revealed that two of these covalent modifications ° (His109 , His370 ) are clearly associated with the active site, and that their C atoms are located less than 9 A from a known inhibitor ° binding site. In addition, the side chain of His370 is within 4 A of the heme group and its modification is expected to influence ° ° the orientation of the heme. The C atom of Tyr71 is within 14 A of the potential inhibitor binding site and within 7 A of the flap undergoing conformational change upon ligand binding, potentially placing Tyr71 near the substrate as it enters and leaves the active site. The data support the hypothesis that EB can inactivate P450 2E1 by covalent modifications and thus add an additional regulatory mechanism for BD metabolism. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction 1,3-Butadiene (BD) is an important industrial chemical used in the production of synthetic rubber that is also found in gasoline, cigarette smoke, and auto exhaust (ATSDR 1992). It is a multi-species, multi-site carcinogen in rodents, with mice being a much more sensitive species than rats [1]. The toxicity of BD is dependent

on its metabolism to several epoxide metabolites, which are presented in Fig. 1. In vitro studies with microsomes identified P450 2E1 as the primary high-affinity isozyme responsible for oxidation of BD to 1,2-epoxy3-butene (EB) [2,3] and of EB to 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB) [4] (Fig. 1). Biomarker studies with DNA [5] and protein [6] adducts showed evidence that the formation of 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol (EB-diol) is supralinear in mice and rats, respectively [7]. It is likely that at these exposures, P450 2E1 activity becomes saturated (low capacity). In contrast, the formation of EB continues to increase with exposures, ranging from 3 to 1250 ppm BD. P450 regulation is mainly controlled by endogenous and exogenous conditions or stress factors. Some P450s are `induced' by certain chemicals through increased synthesis (i.e. phenobarbitol), whereas others are `induced' through protein stabilization by their substrates (i.e. ethanol) [8]. In addition, `suicide' mechanisms involve substrate inactivation, decreased lifespan and accelerated degradation [9]. Relatively little is known about the mechanisms that trigger the regulation of individual P450s. It is possible that post-translational modifications or unmasking of intrinsic molecular or structural signals might be required prior to proteolysis. Such post-translational modifications may include ubiquitination, phosphorylation, conjugation to glutathione, deamination or glycosylation [8,10]. Studies on posttranslational modifications and effects on P450 activity have been limited. In vitro mechanism based inactivation, through the formation of heme and protein adducts,

have been reported for several P450s, including P450 2E1 [11­14]. To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of P450 2E1 regulation, we initially determined amounts of P450 2E1 protein in control and BD treated rodents (Fig. 2). This data demonstrated that BD treatment does not alter P450 2E1 protein levels. The supralinear dosimetry of EB-diol specific DNA and protein adducts is in contrast to the exposure related formation of EB specific protein adducts [7]. These findings suggested that EB-diol formation is selectively inhibited. To investigate this, we studied covalent modifications of P450 2E1 by EB that potentially could alter enzyme activity. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Immunoblotting Liver tissues from mice exposed to 0 or 1250 ppm BD by inhalation for 6 h/day for 5 days and rats exposed to 0

or 1000 ppm BD for 90 days were homogenized in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris­HCl, 150 mM sodium chloride, 12 mM sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors [1 mM NaVO3 , phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride (PMSF), P5726 protease inhibitor mix from Sigma and HALT]. Protein concentrations were determined using Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) reagent, and 80 g of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. P450 2E1 was visualized with rabbit-anti-P450 2E1 and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. 2.2. In vitro reaction of EB with P450 2E1 P450 2E1 (100 g, Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc., Oxford, MI) in PBS buffer was incubated with no (control) or with a 60-fold molar excess of EB overnight at 37  C. Samples were cleaned up on a C4 Zip-Tip (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The P450 2E1 protein was then diluted 1:10 with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested with 1 g Trypsin Gold (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at 37  C. The tryptic fragments were further cleaned up with a C18 Zip-Tip (Millipore) and analyzed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization tandem Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) using an ABI 4700 Proteomic analyzer. Peptides corresponding to P450 2E1 tryptic fragments with an additional 70.09 Da mass, representing the attachment of the 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl (HB) group, were selected for tandem mass spectrometry sequencing (MALDI-MS/MS) to identify the site of alkylation. 2.3. Protein structure modeling The structure of the human P450 2E1 was modeled based on the crystal structure of the human cytochrome P450 2C9/warfarin complex with PDB Accession 1OG5 [15]. P450 2E1 and P450 2C9 share 59% sequence identity and 76% sequence similarity over the extent of the modeled structure. The homology model was built using the modeler module of the Insight II molecular modeling system from Accelrys Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) and evaluated for sequence-structure compatibility using the Verify-3D function of the Profiles-3D module. Verify-3D scores below or near 0.0 reflect structures that are almost certainly incorrect. Verify-3D scores near 1.0 reflect scores similar to that expected for a valid protein of the same size. The P450 2C9 experimentally determined structural template had a verify-3D score of 0.94 while the score for the P450 2E1 homol-

ogy model was 0.73, clearly representing a homology model with structural integrity as would be expected when the template and protein share 59% sequence identity. 3. Results and discussion Under the in vitro conditions used herein, it was shown that EB binds to four histidine and two tyrosine residues. All binding sites were assigned by at least two adjacent and a minimum of eight peptide specific fragments. A summary of peptides containing the EB specific HB-modification is provided in Table 1, and Fig. 3 shows a representative MS/MS spectrum for the HBmodification on His152 . The peptide ions obtained from control and EB treated P450 2E1 were compared to each other and to the theoretically expected peptide ions. A peptide was identified to be HB-modified when the control and the EB treated digests contained a peptide ion of an expected peptide mass and the same ion plus 70.09 Da, respectively. These peptides were then further analyzed by mass spectrometry tandem sequencing to locate the modified amino acid. Previous studies with albumin and hemoglobin revealed that histidines are a common site of alkylation by epoxides, which is in agreement with our findings [16­19]. It has to be mentioned that due to the lysine specific cleavage of trypsin, potentially modified lysines may have not been observed. However, several lysines were reported to be alkylated in the tryptic digests of EB-diol treated albumin suggesting that trypsin is not sensitive to alkylated lysines [19].

The studies were then extended to visualize the modified amino acids in a structural model of P450 2E1 (Fig. 4). The protein modeling revealed that two of these covalent modifications (His109 , His370 ) are clearly associated within the active site and also close to a known inhibitor binding site, with the C atom of the amino ° acid residues located within 9 A. In addition, the side 370 is within 4 A of the heme group and ° chain of His its modification is expected to influence the orientation of the heme in the active site. The C atom of Tyr71 is ° ° within 14 A of an inhibitor binding site and within 7 A of the flap undergoing conformational change upon ligand binding, potentially placing Tyr71 near the substrate as it enters and leaves the active site [20]. His152 and His370 ° are far from ligand binding (>20 A) and on the opposite side of heme. It is therefore difficult to predict how these ligands may affect the catalytic activity. To identify the most susceptible and potentially most important site, we are currently performing additional experiments with various ratios of EB to P450 2E1 (ranging from 0.01 to 10). Further, it is questionable whether all of the

identified modifications form in vivo. Alkylation in vivo is expected to occur most likely within the active site or the heme because it is unlikely that BD is oxidized to EB which then leaves the active site and returns to the enzyme for covalent attachment. Future in vitro studies may involve incubation of P450 2E1 with BD in the presence of NADPH. This experiment will simulate the in vivo situation, where P450 2E1 oxidizes BD to EB, which then can bind directly to the enzyme. In addition, it is known that activated metabolites can covalently bind to the heme, a modification that has not been evaluated in the present study [11]. In this respect, the identification of binding sites represents an initial step and demonstrates that EB has the potential to bind to P450 2E1 at residues that are important for enzyme activity based on structural models. It will be important to carry these studies forward with in vivo exposures to BD. It is presently unknown whether BD metabolites bind to the active sites, and if such bindings are responsible for the saturable metabolism that has been observed in molecular dosimetry studies of BD

derived adducts. These studies showed clear evidence for saturation of EB-diol but not EB formation [7]. Likewise, the formation of DEB appears to be saturated in rats, but not in mice. Thus, it is hypothesized that covalent binding of activated metabolites is in part responsible for the supralinear dose response of BD derived globin and DNA adducts.
