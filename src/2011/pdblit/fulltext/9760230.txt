ABSTRACT: The biochemical and structural properties of bovine retinal nucleoside diphosphate kinase were investigated. The enzyme showed two polypeptides of 17.5 and 18.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE, while isoelectric focusing revealed seven to eight proteins with a pI range of 7.4-8.2. Sedimentation equilibrium yielded a molecular mass of 96 ( 2 kDa for the enzyme. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that both polypeptides contained Gal, Man, GlcNAc, Fuc, and GalNac saccharides. Like other nucleoside diphosphate kinases, the retinal enzyme showed substantial differences in the Km values for various di- and triphosphate nucleotides. Immunogold labeling of bovine retina revealed that the enzyme is localized on both the membranes and in the cytoplasm. Screening of a retinal cDNA library yielded full-length clones encoding two distinct isoforms (NBR-A and NBR-B). Both isoforms were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and their biochemical properties compared with retinal NDP-kinase. The structures of NBR-A and NBR-B were determined by X-ray crystallography in the presence of guanine nucleotide(s). Both isoforms are hexameric, and the fold of the monomer is similar to other nucleoside diphosphate kinase structures. The NBR-A active site contained both a cGMP and a GDP molecule each bound at half occupancy while the NBR-B active site contained only cGMP.

Signal transduction in vertebrate photoreceptor cells begins with absorption of light by the visual pigment rhodopsin and culminates in the closure of ion channels on the plasma membrane. Consecutive binding and hydrolysis of several guanine nucleotides support the flow of information between these two events. In fact, light absorption by rhodopsin induces a GDP-GTP exchange on the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein).1 Entry of GTP into the nucleotide-binding site of the G-protein results in dissociation of the latter from the light-activated rhodopsin and separation of the -subunit complex from the catalytic R-subunit. This, in turn, activates the downstream effector cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by sequestering the inhibitory constraint imposed by the PDE -subunit. The activated PDE hydrolyzes cGMP into 5-GMP, and this modifies the channel function. Hydrolysis of bound GTP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the catalytic R-subunit terminates its interaction with the effector with subsequent

formation of an inactive G-protein. Synthesis of cGMP is accomplished by the membrane-bound guanylate cyclase, returning the concentration of this second messenger to its original level, thereby allowing the channel to reopen and the cell to recover (1-3). The high levels of GTP required for G-protein activation and cGMP synthesis in the retina are likely to be supported by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP-kinase). The activity of the enzyme has been measured in retinal layers and outer segments (4, 5), but the enzyme itself has not been biochemically and structurally characterized. NDP-kinase presumably constitutes an integral part of the cGMP cycle (cGMP f 5-GMP f GDP f GTP f cGMP) and catalyzes the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates to nucleoside triphosphates by a Ping-Pong mechanism involving a highenergy phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. The highenergy phosphate is usually supplied by ATP (6). Several mammalian, bacterial, and plant NDP-kinases have been purified and sequenced (7). The polypeptides range in molecular mass from 17 to 20 kDa, and in some species, two distinct soluble NDP-kinases sharing very high sequence homology have been found. Interestingly, each of these forms has different isoelectric points and mobilities on SDSPAGE. The three-dimensional structures of several NDPkinases are also known and the catalytic mechanisms have been studied in detail (8-12). NDP-kinases, long considered as housekeeping enzymes, are now implicated in the regula-

Bovine Retinal NDP-Kinase tion of several fundamental cellular processes such as development (13), transcriptional activation (14), inhibition of cell differentiation (15), and apoptosis (16). In human tumors, a reduction in nm23 gene expression, an NDP-kinase family member, has been associated with increased metastatic potential of a variety of carcinomas (7). Interestingly, none of these functions involve their NDP-kinase activity. NDPkinase has also been shown to function as a protein kinase that phosphorylates a serine on histone or casein and a histidine on ATP-citrate lyase (17, 18). More recently, NDPkinase was shown to participate in muscarinic K+ channel opening (19). Although the key role of guanine nucleotides in visual transduction is firmly established, what remains unclear is how the phototransduction cascade blends with the biochemical pathways of nucleotide metabolism. Our previous efforts along this line have focused on guanylate kinase (20) and guanylate cyclase (21). In this paper, we have undertaken a systematic study of the biochemical and structural properties of bovine retinal NDP-kinase. The molecular properties of the enzyme, its subcellular localization, cDNA cloning, and heterologous expression, as well as threedimensional structure, are reported. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials. Nucleotides, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and phosphoenolpyruvate were from Sigma.2 Restriction endonucleases and horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Boehringer Mannheim, and the expression vector pALTER-Ex2 was from Promega. The pBluescript M13 vector was from Stratagene, and DNA purification kits were from Qiagen. Sequenase (version 2.0) and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system were from Amersham. LR gold resin was from Polysciences (Warrington, PA), and the Ultrasphere ODS column was from Beckman. Blue Sepharose CL-6B was from Pharmacia Biotech, and crystallization screening kits were from Hampton Research. Frozen bovine retinas were from W. L. Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE). Purification of NDP-Kinase from BoVine Retina. The first stage of the NDP-kinase purification procedure represents a modified guanylate kinase isolation procedure from Hall and Kuhn (5). One hundred frozen bovine retina were thawed and suspended in 170 mL of 10 mM (Na, K, and H) PO4, pH 7.6, containing 0.2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% NaN3. After stirring for 30 min at 4 °C in the light, the concentrations of NaCl and MgCl2 were adjusted to 150 and 4 mM, respectively. The suspension was stirred for another 30 min at 4 °C and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 30000g for 1 h. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 100000g for 30 min to remove trace amounts of membranes. An equal volume of (NH4)2SO4 solution saturated at 60 °C was added to the supernatant and stirred for 2 h at

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 40, 1998 13959 4 °C. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 40000g for 40 min, and the supernatant was brought to 75% saturation with (NH4)2SO4. After stirring overnight at 4 °C, the solution was centrifuged, and the pellet, which contains NDP-kinase, was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 300 mM NaCl (TMED buffer). Any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100000g for 30 min. The clear supernatant was applied to a Blue Sepharose CL-6B column (15 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated with TMED buffer. The column was extensively washed with TMED, and NDP-kinase was eluted with TMED containing 2 mM GTP. Spectrophotometric Assay of NDP-Kinase. NDP-kinase was assayed using a coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehyrogenase enzyme system as described (22). Briefly, the assays were done in a 1 mL reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM KCl, 0.1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.1 mM TDP, 0.1 mg/mL NADH, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, and 2.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5-5 µg of NDP-kinase at 25 °C. Monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 334 nm followed the oxidation of NADH, which reflects ADP formation by NDP-kinase. The specific activity of one unit of enzyme is defined as the turnover of 1 µmol of substrate in 1 min/mg of protein. To measure the apparent Michaelis constant (Km) for the diphosphate nucleotides CDP and TDP, a constant ATP concentration equal to 2 mM was used. For determination of the Km for the triphosphate nucleotides GTP and ATP, 1.4 mM CDP was used as the fixed substrate. The Km values were estimated from double-reciprocal plots by the method of Florini and Vestling (23). Equilibrium Sedimentation. Equilibrium sedimentation was performed with a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge using a four-hole An60-Ti rotor at 20 °C. Data were collected at 280 nm after attaining equilibrium, usually between 18 and 20 h, as an average of 25 measurements at each radial position with a nominal spacing of 0.001 cm between radial positions. The molecular weight of NDPkinase was calculated from the analysis of the concentration distribution of the samples at sedimentation equilibrium using a partial specific volume of 0.73 mL/g as determined from the amino acid compositions. The data obtained at rotor speeds of 14 000 and 17 000 rpm were analyzed in terms of a single, homogeneous species according to

where Cr is the concentration of the sample at a particular radial position, Cm is the concentration of the sample at the meniscus, M is the molecular weight,  is the partial specific volume, F is the solvent density,  is the angular velocity, r is the radial position in centimeters from the center of rotation, rm is the distance in centimeters from the center of rotation to the meniscus, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute (Kelvin) temperature, and B is a correction term for a nonzero baseline. Preparation of Anti-NDP-Kinase Antibodies and Immunogold Labeling of BoVine Retina. Rabbits were injected intradermally with 0.05 mg of purified NDP-kinase/animal in Freunds complete adjuvant followed by three 0.05 mg booster injections at 14 day intervals. Animals were bled 1

13960 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 40, 1998 week after the last booster injection and the sera obtained was used for antibody purification by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and gel filtration. Bovine retinas were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. After an overnight incubation, the fixed retina were washed in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, and then dehydrated for 15-20 min at 4 °C in an ethanol gradient composed of 25, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90% (v/v) ethanol and then three times in 100% ethanol. The specimens were transferred into a mixture of LR Gold Resin:100% ethanol (1:1) for 2-4 h and then into pure LR Gold Resin for an additional 1-2 h at 4 °C. Infiltration in LR Gold Resin was performed at 4-6 °C overnight. Resin-filled polyethylene capsules were held in a rack made of wire and placed in a box coated with aluminum foil on the inside and polymerization was carried out with a UV light source (max ) 360 nm) at 12-14 °C. Thin sections (70-90 nm) were cut with an LKB ultrotome using glass knives. All subsequent incubation steps were performed at 4 °C. Nonspecific background staining was blocked with 0.1% ovalbumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.02% NaN3 for 4 h. Sections were incubated with the anti-NDP-kinase antibodies for 3-4 days, washed with PBS three times for 15-20 min, and then incubated with protein A-10 mm Colloidal Gold (diluted 1:20 in PBS) for 1-2 days. As a control, sections were also incubated with preimmune serum and similarly processed. Immunogold labeled sections were washed with distilled water, stained in 70% ethanol saturated with uranyl acetate and lead citrate in routine fashion, and examined with a JEM 100B electron microscope. Magnifications were calibrated by using cross-grating replicas (d ) 0.463 µm). Carbohydrate Analysis. The purified NDP-kinase subunits were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto poly(vinyldifluoride) membranes, stained with Ponceau S, and the individual polypeptides excised with a razor blade. The strips were destained, washed extensively with deionized water, and dried. Acid hydrolysis of oligosaccharides in the separated NDP-kinase polypeptides was performed essentially as described (24). The oligosaccharides were coupled with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (25), and the monosaccharide fluorescent derivatives separated on an Ultrasphere ODS column (22 × 0.21 cm) with a mobile phase consisting of 6.8% 2-propanol, 3.5% acetonitrile, and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Isolation and Sequence Determination of Peptides DeriVed from NDP-Kinase. Purified NDP-kinase (1 mg) was heat denatured in 100 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.0, at 95 °C for 10 min and subjected to trypsin digestion (1:50, trypsin:NDP-kinase) at 37 °C for 6 h. The digest was applied to a reverse phase HPLC Zorbax C18 column (25 × 0.5 cm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Several peak fractions were collected and further purified on the same column. The peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation on a liquid-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 475A). Screening of the BoVine Retinal cDNA Library. Two oligonucleotides based on the sequences of the tryptic peptides, as well as two additional probes corresponding to the most conserved sequences of NDP-kinases from different sources, were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 381A synthesizer. The oligonucleotide probes were 5-end

Abdulaev et al. labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (26). A bovine retinal cDNA library in bacteriophage -ZAP (provided by M. Applebury, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary) was used for the screening. To screen the library, 4 × 106 bacteriophage was plated out, and filter replicas were prepared using Hybond nitrocellulose filters. The hybridization protocol was adapted from ref 26 with slight modifications to our system. Briefly, the procedure was carried out in the minimal volume of the hybridization buffer with addition of purified radioactively labeled oligonucleotide probe for 1 h at 67 °C and then incubated overnight with slow cooling and shaking. The filters were washed in 4× SSC solution containing 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was performed using Hyperfilm- max film with an intensifying screen for 48 h at -70 °C. Isolation of phage DNA and subcloning of cDNA inserts in the pBluescript M13 vector were done as descibed (27). The plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue, the DNA was purified, and the inserts were sequenced using the dideoxy chaintermination method of DNA sequencing (28). Two distinct cDNA clones, designated NBR-A and NBR-B, were isolated and characterized.3 Expression and Purification of NBR-A and NBR-B NDPKinases. The cDNAs were ligated into the vector pALTEREx2 at the unique EcoRI restriction site in the multiple cloning region. Proper insertion and orientation of NBR-A and NBR-B in the vector were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. The E. coli strain JM109 (DE3) was transformed with the vector pALTER-Ex2 harboring the NBR-A and NBR-B cDNAs. The transformation mixtures were spread on LB/agar plates containing tetracycline, and after 16-18 h at 37 °C, colonies were isolated and cultured overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing tetracycline. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate 500 mL of LB broth containing tetracycline in a 1 L capacity shake flask. After further growth at 37 °C for 16 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, disrupted in a French pressure cell, and purified by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and chromatography on Blue Sepharose essentially as described above. Electrophoretic Analysis of NDP-Kinase. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (29) with a 5% stacking and a 15 or 16% resolving gel. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue or transferred to poly(vinyldifluoride) membranes (30) for immunoblot analysis. Immunoreactive protein was detected using the anti-NDPkinase primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the second antibody. The protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Isoelectric focusing of NDP-kinase was performed using the Pharmacia Multiphor II IEF system using 5% polyacrylamide slab gels containing 2% Pharmalyte and 10% glycerol (pH range 5.5-8.5). Crystallization of NBR-A and NBR-B. Crystallization conditions for the two proteins were screened using Hampton Crystallization Kits I and II. The hanging drop vapor diffusion method was used at room temperature for all of the crystallizations. The 10 µL crystallization drops were formed by combining equal volumes of protein solution and

Bovine Retinal NDP-Kinase reservoir solution. For NBR-A, the final reservoir contained 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 200 mM ammonium acetate, and 15% 4K poly(ethylene glycol). The final drop also contained 5 mM cGMP. The crystals were long rods that appeared in 2 days and grew to 0.1 × 0.2 × 0.8 mm in 3 days. If not used immediately, the crystals redissolved within 8 days. The final crystallization reservoir solution for NBR-B contained 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 2.3 M (NH4)2SO4. The final drop also contained 2.5 mM cGMP. The crystals were large bipyramids that grew to 0.7 × 0.6 × 0.6 mm in 5 months. In contrast to NBR-A, the NBR-B crystals showed no degradation with time. X-ray Data Collection. Diffraction data were collected using Cu KR X-rays generated by a Siemens rotating anode source operated at 40 kV and 80 mA with a 0.3 mm collimator. A Siemens Hi-Star electronic area detector was positioned 140 mm from the crystal, and at a 2 angle of 20° for NBR-A and at 150 mm and at a 2 angle of 20° for NBR-B. The crystals were frozen in nylon loops in cryosolutions made from reservoir solutions containing 20% glycerol for NBR-A and containing 10% 8 K PEG for NBRB. The high-salt NBR-B crystals dissolved when glycerol was used as a cryoprotectant. During data collection, the crystals were maintained at 100 K by an Oxford Cryosystem coldstream. Diffraction data were processed with Xengen (31). Structure Solution. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the AmoRe program (32) from the CCP4 package (33). A combination of the refinement programs XPLOR (34) and TNT (35) was used to refine the atomic positions and thermal factors. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for NBR-A and NBR-B have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (36).4 Other Assays. Protein determinations were done using the BCA method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. RESULTS Purification and Properties of BoVine Retinal NDPKinase. Bovine retinal NDP-kinase was purified by one successive chromatography step on Blue Sepharose after two steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation. The yield of purified enzyme was 1 mg from 200 retina, and the specific activity was 763 units/mg. No appreciable difference was observed in the yield of NDP-kinase or in its functional properties after purification was performed from light- or dark-adapted retina. Purified NDP-kinase was found to be free of guanylate kinase and adenylate kinase activities. NDP-kinase exhibited a doublet on SDS-PAGE, with the molecular masses of the two polypeptides estimated to be 17.5 and 18.5 kDa (Figure 1A, lane 1). Both of these polypeptides were barely visible in the crude retinal extract or in the pellet obtained after 75% saturation with (NH4)2SO4, further emphasizing their relatively low abundance compared to other soluble retinal proteins. Immunoblot analysis of the purified enzyme using anti-NDP-kinase polyclonal antibodies also showed the two polypeptides (Figure 1B, lane 1). The isoelectric focusing pattern of NDPkinase shows seven to eight protein bands with a pI range

from 7.4 to 8.2 (data not shown). Such a plurality of protein bands could be explained by the existence of NDP-kinase oligomers composed of different proportions of the constitutive subunits and/or by varying degrees of phosphorylation within these oligomers. Sedimentation equilibrium of NDPkinase (Figure 2) yielded a single, homogeneous species with a molecular mass of 96 ( 2 kDa. This molecular mass closely approaches that of a hexamer, which is characteristic of virtually all eukaryotic NDP-kinases (37-43). Functional Properties of Retinal NDP-Kinase. The Km values for NDP-kinase were determined at fixed and varying concentrations of diphosphate and triphosphate nucleotides (Table 1). Like other NDP-kinases, retinal NDP-kinase also

Abdulaev et al. group remains to be determined. Digestion of NDP-kinase with trypsin after heat denaturation at elevated pH allowed exhaustive cleavage of the protein and provided facile peptide purification and sequencing. Using this sequence information and taking into account the codon usage of several known retinal proteins, two oligonucleotides were synthesized and used to screen a bovine retinal cDNA library. Two additional probes, constructed on the basis of the most conserved amino acid sequences of known NDP-kinases, were used as controls. Initial screening of the bovine retinal cDNA library yielded several positive clones and, among them, one containing the whole sequence of NDP-kinase (subsequently termed NBRA). Taking into consideration the occurrence of at least two NDP-kinase isoforms in other eukaryotic cells, a second round of screening was attempted using four unique probes based on the nucleotide sequence of the full-length retinal NDP-kinase cDNA (NBR-A). This second round of screening yielded another clone, termed NBR-B (they are designated as A and B in analogy with NDP-kinases from other sources). The clone containing NBR-A had a 696 bp long insert while that containing NBR-B had an 863 bp insert. Sequence analysis of NBR-A and NBR-B showed considerable base differences in both the 5- and 3-noncoding regions, suggesting that they are indeed isoforms of the enzyme. Further, NBR-A and NBR-B differ from each other in four codons. Two nucleotide substitutions are responsible for the amino acid diversity of the NDP-kinase isoforms: Ile-21 and Arg-135 in NBR-A are replaced by Met and His residues, respectively, in NBR-B (Figure 4). The other two codon changes (at Pro-72 and Gly-106) do not result in amino acid substitutions. The deduced amino acid sequences of the NDP-kinase isoforms each consist of 152 residues and the calculated molecular masses are 17 262 kDa for NBR-A and 17 299 kDa for NBR-B. Purification and Properties of Expressed NBR-A and NBRB. The purification protocol for retinal NDP-kinase was successfully adapted for the preparation of NBR-A and NBR-B expressed in E. coli. The yields of purified NBR-A and NBR-B were typically 18-20 mg from a 500 mL shake flask culture, and the specific activities were 857 units/ mg and 1063 units/mg, respectively. Similar to retinal NDP-kinase, the Km of the expressed enzymes for ATP was the lowest among the nucleotides tested with GTP showing a 3-fold higher difference. NBR-A and NBR-B each showed a single polypeptide chain of 17 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Figure 1, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Immunoblot analysis of the expressed enzymes using anti-NDP-kinase polyclonal antibodies raised against the retinal enzyme also showed only the 17 kDa polypeptide (Figure 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Similar to retinal NDP-kinase, the isoelectric focusing patterns of NBR-A and NBR-B show six to seven major protein bands. However, the pI range for NBR-A was 8.0-8.5 while that for NBR-B was 6.5-7.5. Sedimentation equilibrium of the NBR-A and NBR-B isoforms showed molecular masses of 97 and 95 kDa, respectively (data not shown). Like retinal NDP-kinase, this is suggestive of a hexameric arrangement for the expressed enzymes. OVerall Structure of NBR-A and NBR-B NDP-Kinases. NBR-A and NBR-B were subjected to crystallographic analysis in the presence of cGMP, a putative competitive

shows broad specificity for the nucleotide substrate. The Km of the enzyme for ATP (104 µM) was the lowest among the nucleotides tested, while that for GTP was only about three times higher. Because of this relatively small difference in the Km values, it was not possible to obtain accurate and reproducible kinetic measurements using ATP and GDP as the donor and acceptor substrates, respectively. Carbohydrate Analysis of Retinal NDP-Kinase. Given the rather small difference in apparent molecular mass between the two NDP-kinase polypeptides (1 kDa), we surmised that this may be the result of some posttranslational modification. The results of carbohydrate analysis on the 17.5 kDa NDP-kinase polypeptide are shown in Table 2. Virtually identical results were obtained for the 18.5 kDa polypeptide. Both contained equivalent amounts of Gal, Man, GlcNac, Fuc, and GalNac saccharides, which are characteristic of O-linked glycosylation. The total content of carbohydrate in each polypeptide accounts for 2-3% of protein weight. Consequently, retinal NDP-kinase can be referred to as a glycoprotein with a low content of oligosaccharides. Although it is possible that some properties of this enzyme could be explained by the presence of carbohydrates, it is evident that the difference in molecular mass of the NDPkinase subunits may not be attributed to a distinction in oligosaccharide content. Subcellular Localization of NDP-Kinase in BoVine Retina. Figure 3 shows an electron micrograph of immunogoldlabeled bovine retinal sections that had been first incubated with polyclonal anti-NDP-kinase antibodies. The gold particles were primarily localized along the rod outer segment (ROS) disk membranes, but some of the particles were found on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm as well. From these results, it seems reasonable to conclude that ROS NDPkinase may exist in both membrane-associated and cytosolic forms. Cloning of BoVine Retinal NDP-Kinase. Direct sequence analysis of NDP-kinase did not show cleavage of any amino acids, suggesting that the NH2-terminal residue in each of the polypeptides is blocked. The nature of this blocking

inhibitor of retinal NDP-kinase, and their 2.4 Å resolution structures were determined by molecular replacement. The X-ray data and refinement statistics for NBR-A and NBR-B are shown in Table 3. The three-dimensional structures of NBR-A and NBR-B are very similar to each other and to the structures of NDP-kinases from other sources (8, 1012). The monomer folds into a compact structure with a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet partially covered by R-helices (Figure 5). The amino acid residues 53-58 form a boundary for the nucleotide-binding pocket. The region that includes amino acid residues 93-115 is labeled the Kpn loop in reference to a Drosophila mutant. The sequence of this region is strictly conserved between the bovine retinal and Drosophila NDP-kinases and is involved in the most significant trimer contacts. The carboxyl-terminal residue Glu-152 defines the edge of the nucleotide pocket of its neighbor in the trimer. Orthogonal stereoviews of the NBR-A hexamer with each subunit colored differently emphasize this point (Figure 6). Nucleotide-Binding Site. The nucleotide-binding site of NBR-A and NBR-B are very similar to those described for other NDP-kinases (8, 10-12). A stereoview of the NBR-B active site with bound cGMP is shown in Figure 7. The guanosine base of cGMP is stacked face-to-face with Phe160 and Val-112 is on the opposite side. Both of these residues are conserved across species with only one exception. In Myxococcus xanthus, the position equivalent to 112 is an Ile (Figure 4). Notably, the active site of NBR-A contained both a cGMP and a GDP molecule bound at half occupancy. Both nucleotides interact similarly with the active-site residues of the enzyme. DISCUSSION To understand the biochemical events controlling the synthesis of guanine nucleotides involved in visual transduction, the isolation and characterization of retinal enzymes

involved in nucleotide metabolism are desirable. In this paper, a study was undertaken to purify, biochemically characterize, clone, and crystallize one of the key enzymes supporting high levels of GTP in vertebrate photoreceptor cells: NDP-kinase. Bovine retinal NDP-kinase, like those from other sources (37-39), shows two distinct protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 17.5 and 18.5 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1). In contrast, both NBR-A and NBR-B showed a single polypeptide chain of 17 kDa. It is interesting that the correspondence between separate polypeptides and the products of gene isoforms was determined only for human erythrocyte NDP-kinase (40). By protein sequencing, it was shown that the human NDPkinase-A (upper protein band on SDS-PAGE) and NDPkinase-B (lower protein band on SDS-PAGE) polypeptide chains are identical to Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2, respectively, the amino acid sequences of which were deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the corresponding genes (41, 42). Both the SDS-PAGE and cDNA cloning results indicate that there exists at least two NDP-kinase isoforms in bovine retina (Figures 1 and 4), as is the case for other higher eukaryotes (42-44). However, NBR-A and NBR-B are remarkably similar in their coding nucleotide and amino acid sequences with identities of 99.1 and 98.8%, respectively. Therefore, the 1 kDa difference in apparent molecular weight between the two retinal NDP-kinase polypeptides suggests that either they are subject to different posttranslational modifications or bovine retina contain yet another NDP-kinase isoform. Sedimentation equilibrium of the retinal (Figure 2) and expressed NDP-kinases suggests that the enzymes exist as a hexamer. This is further substantiated by the threedimensional structures of NBR-A and NBR-B (Figure 6). Tetrameric structure is inherent in bacterial NDP-kinases from M. xanthus and E. coli, and such a subunit structure is

not common for proteins from eukaryotic organisms where the hexameric form is most frequent (8, 9, 45-52). Posttranslational modifications of retinal NDP-kinase appear to include glycosylation, blocking of the NH2-terminal amino acid, and most probably, phosphorylation. Both subunits of the enzyme from bovine retina contain 2-3% (w/w) of carbohydrate, which consists of Gal, Man, GlcNac,

Fuc, and GalNac saccharides (Table 2). All eukaryotic NDPkinases contain a potential O-glycosylation site [ERTF (53), amino acid residues 5-8], and another consensus Oglycosylation motif, VKTG (amino acid residues 84-87), is preserved in proteins from mammals and D. melanogaster (Figure 4). These potential glycosylation sites are also on the outside of the molecule and readily accessible for modification (Figure 5). In fact, these sites are adjacent to one another; the distance between the CR of Glu-5 and Val84 is 7 Å. The assumption of NH2-terminal amino acid blocking is inferred from the absence of Edman degradation on retinal NDP-kinase. Although the NH2-terminal Met is not included on the structures reported here, Ala-2 is on the surface of the molecule (Figure 5). Differences in the extent of amino acid residue phosphorylation were implied from the isoelectric focusing experiments on both the retinal and expressed enzymes. The His-118 residue, a phosphorylation site on NDP-kinase, is present in all known NDP-kinases (Figure 4). NBR-A and NBR-B both contain an AMKF sequence (amino acid residues 37-40) which is nearly conserved as the ATP-binding region in cyclic nucleotidedependent protein kinases. Lys-39 in this region is invariant

in nearly all NDP-kinases and is essential for catalytic activity (60). Kinetic studies of retinal and expressed NDP-kinases showed that the enzymes display low substrate specificity (Table 2), as illustrated for other NDP-kinases. However, NDP-kinase can function in a low ATP containing enviroment (Km of retinal NDP-kinase for ATP of 104 µM) with

high velocity, supplying a sufficient level of nucleoside triphosphates in visual cells. The specific activity of retinal NDP-kinase, 763 units/mg, is considerably high when compared with other guanine nucleotide pathway enzymes. For example, the specific activity of retinal guanylate kinase is 340 units/mg (5). The turnover number of NDP-kinase is 229 mol of CTP produced/mol of enzyme/s or 1374 mol of CTP produced/mol of enzyme/s for a hexamer. This is considerably greater than the turnover number of guanylate kinase (130 mol of GDP produced/mol of enzyme/s). These findings suggest that even relatively small amounts of guanylate kinase (20, 54) and NDP-kinase in the ROS are greater in terms of absolute activity than guanylate cyclase (55-58). Therefore, these two enzymes may support local cGMP requirements at the expense of ATP, which is produced abundantly in the ROS as a result of anaerobic glycolysis (59), without the need for shuttling GMP from the ROS to the rod inner segment (RIS) for conversion to GTP. The specific activities of purified NBR-A and NBR-B, 857 units/mg and 1063 units/mg, respectively, are slightly higher than the retinal enzyme. This difference in specific activity between the two isoforms is most likely due to the amino acid variance at position 135, which is a His in NBR-A and an Arg in NBR-B (Figure 4). Residue 135 is on the exterior of the molecule near the 2-fold interface (Figures 5 and 6). It is also possible that this charge difference may influence the phosphorylation state of the protein and account for the observed differences in pI between the two isoforms. Since the exact amino acid composition or polypeptide composition of the retinal NDP-kinase hexamer is not known, it is difficult to rationalize the observed difference in specific activity and pI from the NBR-A and NBR-B isoforms. The enzyme pattern of NDP-kinase has been localized almost exclusively to the RIS (4), a region of the rod cell that contains the biosynthetic and bioenergetic pathways. However, NDP-kinase with the same kinetic and electrophoretic properties can be isolated from highly purified ROS,5 suggesting that the enzyme is compartmentalized in both the ROS and RIS. These observations are consistent with our immunocytochemical electron microscopy data (Figure 3), which shows the distribution of NDP-kinase in the ROS.

13966 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 40, 1998 Interest in the possible role of NDP-kinase in a variety of signal transduction pathways has dramatically increased, and much evidence exists for participation of the enzyme in this process. It was shown that plasma membrane bound NDPkinase may function as a GTP supply machinery for the G-protein involved in hormone-dependent adenylate cyclase systems (61). NDP-kinase can transfer the -phosphate of ATP directly to GDP bound to G proteins, and this phosphorylation results in the activation of the signalcoupling proteins (62). One possible way in which NDPkinase participates in signal transduction was proposed by Ruggieri and McCormick (63). Although the GTP level in the cell is estimated to be much higher than that of GDP, a local GTP:GDP ratio may have a significant impact on the nucleotide supply in the immediate vicinity of the G-protein. This ratio is altered as a result of NDP-kinase activity. Existence of such GTP and GDP microcompartments could account for effect of NDP-kinase on G-proteins. Further, since cGMP levels in the retina are directly influenced by GTP via guanylate cyclase, it is reasonable to consider that cGMP itself may act as a competitive inhibitor of NDPkinase in order to prevent the further conversion of GDP to GTP. In NDP-kinase from M. xanthus, cAMP is known to act as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (64). Similar effects of cAMP and various cAMP analogues on the ATP/ GDP phosphotransferase activity of Nm-23 have also been reported (65). The active sites of NBR-A and NBR-B can accommodate a GDP and/or a cGMP molecule (Figures 5 and 7), suggesting that cGMP may serve to inhibit the phosphotransferase activity of retinal NDP kinase. Like NBR-A and NBR-B, the active site of the M. xanthus NDPkinase/cAMP closely resembles that of the ADP-ligated complex (64). The biochemical and structural characterization of NDPkinase from bovine retina will allow us to further investigate its role in the regulation of the GTP supply to G-proteins and other components involved in visual transduction. The availability of the cDNA sequences for retinal NDP-kinase should allow for the overexpression of mutant forms of the enzyme in sufficient quantities for three-dimensional structure determination.
