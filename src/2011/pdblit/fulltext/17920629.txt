SUMMARY

Resistance to human skin innate defenses is crucial for survival and carriage of Staphylococcus aureus, a common cutaneous pathogen and nasal colonizer. Free fatty acids extracted from human skin sebum possess potent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. The mechanisms by which S. aureus overcomes this host defense during colonization remain unknown. Here, we show that S. aureus IsdA, a surface protein produced in response to the host, decreases bacterial cellular hydrophobicity rendering them resistant to bactericidal human skin fatty acids and peptides. IsdA is required for survival of S. aureus on live human skin. Reciprocally, skin fatty acids prevent the production of virulence determinants and the induction of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus and other Gram-positive pathogens. A purified human skin fatty acid was effective in treating systemic and topical infections of S. aureus suggesting that our natural defense mechanisms can be exploited to combat drug-resistant pathogens.
INTRODUCTION Staphylococcus aureus is a highly adaptable human pathogen responsible for many infections and fatalities worldwide; the spread of antibiotic resistance is alarming as it limits available therapies (Waldvogel, 1995). As a common cutaneous and nasal commensal and pathogen, resistance to human skin innate defenses is a crucial requirement for survival and colonization. Human skin gives physical protection partly because it is composed of tightly associated epithelial cells covered by a highly cross-linked layer of keratin normally impenetrable to bacteria. Additionally, skin displays microbicidal activity via an array of bioactive molecules, among which antimicrobial

peptides (AMPs) are of critical importance to host defense (Ong et al., 2002; Niyonsaba and Ogawa, 2005). Bacteria such as S. aureus, which colonize the skin and cause disease, can resist host innate defenses by varied means, including modification of the cellular envelope (Peschel, 2002; Nizet, 2006). In addition to AMPs, several free fatty acids extracted from sebum on human skin possess potent antimicrobial activity (Miller et al., 1988; Wille and Kydonieus, 2003; Takigawa et al., 2005). In particular, cis-6-hexadecanoic acid (C16:1D6, C-6-H) is the most effective killing agent against S. aureus (Wille and Kydonieus, 2003; Takigawa et al., 2005). Surface proteins of S. aureus are required for virulence and interact with many human extracellular matrix (ECM) and serum proteins. Most previously characterized ECM binding proteins are covalently bound to the cell wall peptidoglycan (reviewed by Clarke and Foster, 2006). A covalently attached surface protein, IsdA, is required for nasal colonization and is expressed in vivo under conditions of iron starvation (Clarke et al., 2004, 2006). Here we report the importance of IsdA for resistance to human skin defenses, in particular fatty acids. The skin fatty acids have more than one mode of action and are effective in control of infection by S. aureus. RESULTS IsdA Affects Cellular Physical Properties Iron limitation is an environmental signal often indicative of mammalian host-pathogen interaction (Schaible and Kaufmann, 2004; Clarke et al., 2006). Under iron-starvation conditions, IsdA is the predominant covalently attached surface protein (Figure 1A). The effect that the presence of IsdA has on cell surface hydrophobicity was measured by microbial adhesion to hexadecane (MATH) test and by water contact-angle analysis. Wild-type S. aureus (SH1000 and Newman) grown without iron exhibited decreased hydrophobicity compared to those grown with iron (Figure 1B). This iron-deprivation-associated decrease in hydrophobicity was due to IsdA as SRC005 (isdA) and SRC105 (isdA) were not affected by iron

availability (Figure 1B). The decrease in hydrophobicity was isdA dependent as the complemented mutants SRC005 (isdA) and SRC105 (isdA) carrying the wild-type isdA+ gene on a multicopy plasmid behaved in the same manner as wild-type (Figure 1B). In all cases, cells producing IsdA were significantly less hydrophobic than those not producing the protein (p < 0.00001). Water contact angles (q) of materials, in this case S. aureus cells grown without FeSO4, increase with hydrophobicity (Absolom, 1988). q = 5 and 3 were found for SH1000 and Newman,

respectively, while for strains SRC005 (isdA) and SRC105 (isdA), q = 11 and 9 , respectively. Addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a bacterial suspension lowers the surface tension of the suspending liquid and hence reduces interaction with hydrophobic substrates (Absolom, 1988). Increasing DMSO concentration led to a decrease in adherence to hexadecane (Figure 1C), demonstrating the hydrophobic nature of the interaction. Similar results were obtained using S. aureus Newman and SRC105 (isdA) (Figure S1). The role of IsdA in net cell surface

charge was determined as the electrical potential of the interface between the bacterial surface and the aqueous environment (z potential) (Wilson et al., 2001). The electronegative bacterial surface became more negatively charged as a result of the presence of IsdA (Figure 1D). In order to demonstrate that IsdA alone is capable of altering cellular hydrophobicity, isdA was cloned into Lactococcus lactis, a heterologous expression system for Gram-positive bacterial surface proteins (Figure 1E). The presence of IsdA in the cell wall of L. lactis led to decreased hydrophobicity of whole cells as measured by MATH test (Figure 1F, p < 0.0001). Thus, IsdA has a significant role in determination of cellular physical properties. Previously, it has been proposed that S. aureus protein A (Spa) confers increased cellular hydrophobicity (Wad¨ strom, 1990). IsdB is another iron-regulated surface protein (Mazmanian et al., 2002; Figure 1A). Sortase A (SrtA) is the enzyme responsible for the attachment to the cell wall of all but one covalently bound S. aureus surface proteins, including Spa, IsdB, and IsdA (Mazmanian et al., 1999; Mazmanian et al., 2002). Under iron-replete conditions, spa, isdB, and srtA mutations (Table S1) led to an insignificant change in cellular hydrophobicity by the MATH test (p > 0.05 in all cases; Figure S2). Under lowiron conditions, the spa and isdB mutations resulted in no difference compared to respective parents, as was srtA compared to isdA (p > 0.1 in all cases, Figure S2). Thus, under the conditions used, IsdA is the only covalently attached S. aureus surface protein which significantly affects cellular hydrophobicity. The observations that in vitro binding of heme by recombinant IsdA occurs (Mazmanian et al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2004; Vermeiren et al., 2006; Grigg et al., 2007) led us to investigate the role that this may play in affecting cellular hydrophobicity. Binding of heme to S. aureus was not affected by production of IsdA (Figure S3A) and did not affect cellular hydrophobicity (Figure S3B). IsdA Decreases Biofilm Formation Increased cellular hydrophobicity is regarded as a factor ¨ in the propensity of staphylococci to form biofilms (Gotz, 2002). Production of IsdA by S. aureus Newman substantially reduced the culture's ability to form a biofilm (Figure S4A), as did heterologous expression of isdA in L. lactis (Figure S4B). Therefore, in host niches where IsdA is important, biofilm formation may be reduced. The molecular basis for lack of a role in SH1000 is unknown, but strain variation in biofilm formation has been well established (Johnson et al., 2005). Decreased Cellular Hydrophobicity Affects the Sensitivity of S. aureus to Elements of Host Innate Defenses We hypothesized that the change in hydrophobicity of S. aureus, upon production of IsdA, would alter the organism's sensitivity to bactericidal hydrophobic fatty acids found on human skin sebum and, in particular, the potent antistaphylococcal C-6-H (Wille and Kydonieus, 2003; Takigawa et al., 2005). In killing assays, isdA mutants

were more sensitive than their parents to human sebum and C-6-H (Figures 2A­2D). Similarly, cells producing IsdA (wild-type grown without iron) exhibited higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) than those lacking the protein (isdA mutants or wild-type grown with iron) (Table 1). Complementation of the isdA mutation fully restored the resistance phenotype (Figures 2A­2D). With commonly available fatty acids (linoleic, lauric, capric, and palmitoleic acid), IsdA gave increased resistance to killing (Figure S5) and MICs (Table 1). Additionally, expression of isdA in L. lactis led to increased resistance to the bactericidal effects of both sebum and C-6-H (Figures 2F and 2G). Therefore, IsdA confers protection to S. aureus against the bactericidal activity of sebum fatty acids by decreasing cellular hydrophobicity, thus reducing the potential for hydrophobic interactions. In order to confirm that hydrophobic and/or ionic interactions are important for C-6-H activity, DMSO was included in killing assays to reduce the surface tension of the suspending liquid, which led to increased survival (Figure S6). Increasing concentrations of NaCl did not alter the survival rate (data not shown). Thus hydrophobic, but not ionic, interactions between C-6-H and S. aureus are important for activity. Such surface protein mediated resistance to skin fatty acids has not previously been described. Addition of heme to cells did not affect sensitivity to C-6-H (data not shown). Hydrophobic interactions are also required for AMPs to interact with the bacterial cell envelope (Matsuzaki, 1999; Shai, 2002). The role of IsdA in AMP resistance was tested via a series of killing assays using recombinant human b-defensin 2 (hBD2), synthetic mouse cathelicidin (mCRAMP), and native human pulmonary surfactant protein B (PSP-B). Expression of both hBD2 and cathelicidin is induced in keratinocytes by S. aureus (Ong et al., 2002). PSP-B is a hydrophobic peptide constitutively secreted into the alveolar airspace and is bactericidal for S. aureus (Ryan et al., 2006). In all instances, iron-deprived S. aureus Newman was more resistant than SRC105 (isdA) in a killing assay (Figure 2E). This effect was not seen in the SH1000 strain background, indeed no PSP-B killing was observed (data not shown). Strain variation in sensitivity to host AMPs has been reported previously (Komatsuzawa et al., 2006). All three AMPs used are cationic and given that IsdA increases the electronegative charge of S. aureus, it may result in AMP sequestration thus preventing access to their cell membrane target. This could be excluded, however, because addition of a molar excess of IsdA (5:1) did not affect the killing activity of mCRAMP (data not shown). Mutation of spa, isdB, or srtA had no effect on sensitivity to C-6-H or mCRAMP under iron-replete conditions (data not shown). Under iron-starved conditions, the sensitivity of SRC055 (spa) and DU5873 (spa) to C-6-H and mCRAMP was the same as their respective wild-types. Strains SRC050 (srtA) and SRC150 (srtA) were just as sensitive to C-6-H and mCRAMP as SRC005 (isdA) and SRC105 (isdA) in MIC and killing assays, indicating that under low-iron conditions, IsdA is the major covalently

attached surface protein responsible for resistance to C-6-H and mCRAMP. Previous studies have shown that the DltABCD and MprF proteins of S. aureus act to decrease the net negative charge of the cell envelope by alanylating teichoic acids and lysinylating membrane phosphatidylglycerol, respectively (Peschel et al., 1999; Peschel et al., 2001). Both surface charge modifications are associated with increased in vitro resistance to cationic AMPs (Peschel et al., 1999; Peschel et al., 2001; Weidenmaier et al., 2005). Mutation of either dltA (in the SA113 background) or mprF (in the SA113, SH1000, and Newman backgrounds) had no effect on cellular hydrophobicity as

determined by MATH test or sensitivity to C-6-H or sebum (data not shown). The dltA mutation could not be transferred to other backgrounds due to spontaneous spectinomycin resistance. IsdA Is Required for Survival of S. aureus on Live Human Skin The above data, together with the finding that IsdA protects against bactericidal fatty acids, represent a potential mechanism for protection of S. aureus against host innate defenses on the skin. A DisdA mutant was used to study survival of live bacteria on the skin of healthy human volunteers. Significantly higher numbers of wild-type than

DisdA bacteria were recovered from the volunteers, in both SH1000 and Newman strain backgrounds (p < 0.0002 and p < 0.00002, respectively; Figure 3). No other S. aureus components required for survival on the human host have been described previously. IsdA Confers Resistance to Lantibiotics Decreased cellular hydrophobicity due to unidentified changes in the cell envelope of Listeria monocytogenes has been found to be a cause of resistance to nisin (Davies et al., 1996), a hydrophobic, positively charged (Chan-Ick and Pyun, 2005) lantibiotic (lanthionine containing antibiotic). IsdA rendered S. aureus more resistant in killing (Figure S7) and MIC assays (Table 1) to both nisin and mersacidin (another hydrophobic lantibiotic, but with no net charge; Chatterjee et al., 1992). Thus, iron limitation in the host may make S. aureus more resistant to hydrophobic antibiotics than under standard laboratory growth conditions, with implications for susceptibility testing. Skin Fatty Acids Prevent Induction of Virulence Factors and Antibiotic Resistance in Gram-Positive Bacteria In a range of Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus, glycerol monolaurate (GML), a mild surfactant commonly used as a food additive and in cosmetics, has been shown to block expression of various virulence factors (in S. aureus, a-hemolysin, protein A, and toxic shock syndrome toxin) and antibiotic resistance at sub-growth-inhibitory concentrations (Schlievert et al., 1992; Holland et al., 1994; Projan et al., 1994; Ruzin and Novick, 1998; Vetter and Schlievert, 2005). Lauric acid, a fatty acid and product of GML hydrolysis by S. aureus lipases, has equivalent inhibitory properties (Ruzin and Novick, 2000). The mechanism of this inhibition is not known but is presumed to be due to the surfactant nature of both substances. Neither GML nor lauric acid inhibits secretion, and the effect is most likely through the generic inhibition of signal transduction (Projan et al., 1994; Ruzin and Novick, 1998). However, the agr quorum sensing system is not inhibited as the RNAIII effector molecule is still produced (Projan et al., 1994). As we had noted a role for IsdA in the sensitivity to human skin fatty acids, it was hypothesized that sebum and C-6-H may inhibit virulence factor production. The addition of C-6-H or sebum gave a dose-dependent decrease in a-hemolysin (Hla) activity of S. aureus culture supernatant (Figure 4A). Mutation of isdA led to a marked decrease in the concentration of C-6-H or sebum needed to inhibit Hla activity (Figure 4A). Experiments in the strain Newman background gave comparable results (data not shown). Comparison of Hla production in isdA mutants containing either pIsdA or pMK4 grown in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml sebum or 0.5 mg/ml C-6-H showed that complementation restored resistance to both substances (data not shown). Reporter gene (lacZ) fusion analysis was used to determine at what level the inhibition occurred. S. aureus strains (SH1000 and isdA backgrounds) with lacZ fused to hla, spa, and RNAIII (hld) were grown in iron-depleted medium, with and without sebum or C-6-H.

Transcription of hla and spa was inhibited at sebum and C-6-H concentrations of 20 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml (subgrowth-inhibitory concentrations in iron-depleted TSB) respectively (Figure S8). However, at (subinhibitory) concentrations of 5 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml (sebum and C-6-H, respectively), transcription of hla and spa was only inhibited in the isdA strain (data not shown), which correlates with the Hla assay data (Figure 4A). Moreover, agr is not affected by sebum or C-6-H in the wild-type or isdA strain (Figure S8 and data not shown). Thus, the effect is mediated at the transcriptional level, not inhibition of agr, but likely occurs by inhibition of another signal transduction pathway. Expression of isdA upon addition of sebum (20 mg/ml) and C-6-H (5 mg/ml) was found, by lacZ fusion assay, to be unaltered (data not shown). Although GML can protect eukaryotic cells from Hla activity (Peterson and Schlievert, 2006), this did not occur for sebum and C-6-H (data not shown). If inhibition of bacterial virulence determinant production by human skin fatty acids is an innate defense mechanism, then the phenomenon is unlikely to be S. aureus specific. Hemolysin production by the Gram-positive pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae (grown in BHI) was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by sub-MICs of sebum (Figure 4C) as has been shown for GML (Ruzin and Novick, 1998). Interestingly, C-6-H only inhibited production of hemolysin from S. agalactiae. C-6-H and sebum did not protect the rabbit erythrocytes directly from hemolysin activity. Neither C-6-H nor sebum inhibited production of pneumolysin by Streptococcus pneumoniae after lysis of the bacteria (data not shown). Resistance of S. aureus to b-lactam antibiotics is a major problem, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are responsible for many deaths. Production of b-lactamase is controlled by the bla regulatory apparatus, which is often responsible for the regulation of mecA, the gene encoding methicillin resistance, in many strains with inducible resistance (Hackbarth and Chambers, 1993). Sub-MICs of both sebum and C-6-H inhibited the induction of b-lactamase in S. aureus containing pI9787, and IsdA repressed this inhibitory effect (Figure 4B). Vancomycin has long been used as the antibiotic of last resort, but the rise of resistant Enterococcus faecalis and the appearance of vancomycin resistant S. aureus are of great concern. Using E. faecalis JH2-2, it was found that at sub-MIC levels of C-6-H and sebum, vancomycin resistance was inhibited (Figure 4D). This likely occurs by inhibition of resistance induction as for GML (Ruzin and Novick, 1998) but could reflect a synergistic inhibition of growth. Thus, human skin defenses can prevent antibiotic resistance in important pathogens. The C Domain of IsdA Is Responsible for Resistance Properties and Increased Survival on Human Skin The well-documented ligand binding activity of IsdA has been mapped to its NEAT domain, near the IsdA N terminus end (Figure S9) (Clarke et al., 2004; Vermeiren et al., 2006), whereas the function of the C-terminal domain is unknown. In-frame deletions of the NEAT (amino acid

Serial dilutions of antimicrobials were used and MICs taken as the lowest concentration which inhibited growth. S. aureus strains were grown in CL or CT-TSB broth, with or without 20 mM FeSO4 for 16 hr at 37 C with shaking. All assays were repeated three times with the same result.

residues I69 to E177 deleted) and C (amino acid residues K178 to K311 deleted) domains (Figure S9) were created in S. aureus (Figure S10A), and corresponding proteins produced in L. lactis. A western blot of IsdB confirmed loading of consistent amounts of cell wall material to each lane (Figure S10B). The roles of IsdA domains in determining cell surface hydrophobicity were measured by the MATH test. S. aureus SRC008 (isdADNEAT) and SRC108 (isdADNEAT) (in SH1000 and Newman, respectively) grown without iron exhibited decreased hydrophobicity compared to those from iron-replete media, as do their parents (Figure 5A). S. aureus SRC009 (isdADC) and SRC109 (isdADC) (in SH1000 and Newman, respectively) did not display any change in hydrophobicity when iron depleted, similar to SRC005 (isdA) and SRC105 (isdA) (Figure 5A), but did possess fibrinogen binding activity, demonstrating its exposure to the extracellular milieu (Figure S11). Neither mutant form of IsdA enhanced binding of heme to S. aureus (Figures S3A and S3B). The production of full-length IsdA from the complementation plasmid (pIsdA) restored the dynamic hydrophobicity properties of the cells (Figure 5A). In all cases, cells expressing IsdA or IsdADNEAT were significantly less hydrophobic that those expressing IsdADC or the mutant (p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference between IsdA and IsdADNEAT (p > 0.1) or IsdADC and no IsdA (p > 0.1). In L. lactis, the presence of IsdADNEAT (p < 0.0001) or full-length IsdA, but not IsdADC (p > 0.05), led to decreased cellular hydrophobicity as measured by the MATH test (Figure S12A). Thus, the

change in cellular hydrophobicity observed upon production of IsdA is due to the C domain and not the NEAT domain. The C domain of IsdA is also required for resistance to host innate defenses. S. aureus producing IsdADNEAT exhibited wild-type resistance, as measured by MIC (Table 1) and killing assays (Figures 5B and 5C), whereas cells producing IsdADC possessed the same phenotype as isdA mutants (Table 1; Figures 5B and 5C). Complementation of the isdADC mutation with isdA fully restored

resistance (Figure 5B, C). Experiments in L. lactis showed that production of IsdADNEAT, but not IsdADC, conferred increased resistance to killing by sebum and C-6-H (Figures S12B and S12C). S. aureus SRC108 (Newman isdADNEAT), but not SRC109 (Newman isdADC), showed parental resistance levels in killing assays to mCRAMP and PSP-B (Figure 5D). Similarly, S. aureus SRC108 (Newman isdAD NEAT) but not SRC109 (Newman isdADC) displays the parental iron-associated change in MICs (Table 1) and resistance to killing by nisin and mersacidin (Newman) (data not shown). The role of the IsdA C domain in survival of bacteria on human skin was tested. When applied to the skin of human volunteers, there was no difference between the survival rates of S. aureus strains SH1000 and SRC008 (isdAD

NEAT) (Figure 5E). However, significantly higher numbers of SH1000 than SRC009 (isdADC) bacteria were recovered (Figure 5E). Thus the C domain of IsdA is responsible for the ability of IsdA to promote survival of S. aureus on human skin, likely via resistance to human innate defenses. The role of the C domain of IsdA in resistance to sebum or C-6-H, inhibition of a-hemolysin, and b-lactamase expression was tested. Loss of the IsdA C domain in S. aureus SRC009 (isdADC) but not the NEAT domain in SRC008 (isdADNEAT) led to a marked decrease in the concentration of C-6-H or sebum required to inhibit Hla (Figure 5F) and b-lactamase (Figure 5G) induction compared to SH1000 with similar results in Newman (data not shown). Comparison of Hla production in isdADC mutants containing either pIsdA or pMK4 grown in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml sebum or 0.5 mg/ml C-6-H showed

that complementation restored resistance to both substances (data not shown). Skin Fatty Acids Can Cure S. aureus Disease Thus, human sebum, and in particular C-6-H, can disable a number of Gram-positive pathogens at several levels. There has been much speculation regarding the use of innate host defense components in treatment of infections. Indeed, the structure-function relationships of host antimicrobial peptides have been used to design de novo inhibitors (Shai, 2002). To test the therapeutic potential of C-6-H, it was used to treat mice in a number of experiments (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In a mouse model of systemic S. aureus infection, injection of C-6-H led to significantly reduced bacterial load with two different inocula (Figure 6A; Figure S13) and decreased production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 (Figure 6B). At an increased inoculum (7.5 3 107 cfu), treatment with C-6-H completely prevented death (n = 10), compared to 4 deaths out of 10 for the control. Also, in an atopic dermatitis model with superimposed S. aureus infection, topical application of C-6-H led to a highly significant reduction of S. aureus cfu present (Figure 6C). DISCUSSION The interaction between S. aureus and its human host is complex and multifactorial as it can colonize several host niches, both as an opportunist pathogen of great medical significance and a commensal in the nose and on skin. Iron deprivation is a common host environmental stimulus, and, in response to this, S. aureus makes a predominant cell-wall-bound protein IsdA. Previously, IsdA has been shown to bind to many different human ligands, to be an adhesin, and to be required for nasal colonization (Taylor and Heinrichs, 2002; Clarke et al., 2004, 2006). The prevalence of IsdA led us to hypothesize that, in fact, this protein may affect the cellular physical properties. Surprisingly, the presence of IsdA rendered S. aureus more hydrophilic and negatively charged. No other Grampositive cell-wall-bound protein has previously been shown with such a role, and our data suggest that in S. aureus, there are no other such proteins which affect cellular hydrophobicity. In fact, many adhesins make bac¨ teria more hydrophobic (Wadstrom, 1990). This apparent paradox was resolved when IsdA was found to have an additional function in resistance to host innate defense mechanisms such as fatty acids and antimicrobial peptides, which require hydrophobic interaction for their activity. Our data show that the C domain of IsdA is responsible for this action and that the ligand binding NEAT domain does not influence the physical properties of the cell. Recent studies have examined the structure of IsdA and shown it to be an extended asymmetric monomer in solution, which is proposed to allow the molecule to extend into the extracellular environment (Vermeiren et al., 2006). The structure of the NEAT domain has been solved and shown to consist of b sheet formation and a hydrophobic heme binding pocket (Grigg et al., 2007). However, the

NEAT domain has no role in determining overall cellular hydrophobicity. Therefore, we propose that the C-domain of IsdA protrudes through the cell wall, altering cellular charge and hydrophobicity. Innate defense mechanisms form part of the primary interface between the host and potential pathogens. This interaction is dynamic and there are a number of bacterial mechanisms involved in overcoming the host defenses such as charge alterations (reviewed by Peschel, 2002; Nizet, 2006), efflux pumps (Kupferwasser et al., 1999; Bayer et al., 2000), and modification enzymes (Chamberlain and Brueggemann, 1997; SieprawskaLupa et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2004; Lai et al., 2007). S. aureus has the additional capacity, in response to the host environment, to become less hydrophobic and so reduce its susceptibility to key host defenses. This is highlighted by the fact that IsdA is required for survival on live human skin in a volunteer model. Although iron is lost through human skin in sweat (Cohn and Emmett, 1978) and primarily by desquamation of epithelial cells (Croft, 1970; Molin and Wester, 1976), it is not biologically available as it is sequestered by storage proteins such as transferrin and ferritin (Fisher, 1965; Nakayashiki, 1990; Milstone et al., 2006). Skin fatty acids are potent bactericidal agents and help to prevent colonization by potential pathogens. They are an important facet of our innate defenses, and, in fact, a toll-like receptor mediated pathway in mice leads to increased fatty acid production and protection against S. aureus skin infections (Georgel et al., 2005). S. aureus is important in atopic dermatitis, and fatty acids are able to reduce the severity of infection (Takigawa et al., 2005; Gilani et al., 2005). Fatty acids are also able to kill S. aureus within abscesses (Dye and Kapral, 1981). In particular, C-6-H has been purified from human skin as the major bactericidal fatty acid for S. aureus (Wille and Kydonieus, 2003; Takigawa et al., 2005). Patients with atopic dermatitis show reduced C-6-H levels and increased colonization with S. aureus. Topical treatment with C-6-H results in a decrease in S. aureus levels (Takigawa et al., 2005). Our observation that C-6-H can be used to treat experimental atopic dermatitis, and, in fact, systemic infection by S. aureus, opens up the possibility of a novel range of antibiotics exploiting natural host defenses. New treatments for S. aureus are acutely required due to the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant strains (Marchese et al., 2000). How C-6-H and other fatty acids kill S. aureus is unknown, but is likely to include more than one mechanism. Fatty acids have been shown to inhibit many bacterial uptake and biosynthetic pathways, possibly due to the uncoupling of ATP synthesis (Galbraith and Miller, 1973; Greenway and Dyke, 1979). Linoleic acid can be taken up and incorporated into lipid containing compounds (Greenway and Dyke, 1979; Greenway and Dyke, 1980). If lipid hydroperoxides are produced these are highly toxic to bacterial cells (Memon et al., 2000; Klomsiri et al., 2005). Of course it is also likely that the surfactant properties of C-6-H result in disruption of the membrane and lysis. Our work has also highlighted a novel mechanism of action for skin fatty acids, which is likely to contribute

to their ability to disarm several important pathogens. Surprisingly, treatment of S. aureus with sub-MIC of C-6-H or sebum suppressed the production of key virulence factors and b-lactamase in a dose dependent manner at the transcriptional level. Previously, the food additive GML has also been shown to have this effect (Schlievert et al., 1992; Projan et al., 1994; Holland et al., 1994) and we would hypothesize that their proposed mechanism of action is similar (partitioning into the cell membrane and inhibition of signal transduction processes). However, the key quorum-sensing regulator, Agr, is not affected by GML (Projan et al., 1994) or C-6-H, and, thus, the mechanism is likely agr independent. Virulence determinant regulation in S. aureus is complex, and more than one signal transduction pathway may be affected. IsdA renders the bacteria much more resistant to the inhibitory effects of the fatty acids and thus will allow the organism to colonize more effectively in response to the host environment. The virulence determinant and antibiotic resistance inhibitory capabilities of skin fatty acids are not unique to S. aureus, and, in fact, a number of important Grampositive pathogens are affected as has been found for GML (Schlievert et al., 1992). Interestingly, however, sebum, but not C-6-H, inhibited induction of hemolysin synthesis in S. pyogenes suggesting that specific receptors for fatty acids may be present in Gram-positive bacteria. Human skin therefore has the ability to specifically disrupt important virulence-associated mechanisms of bacterial pathogens. This is further evidence of the complex and unfolding interplay between humans and opportunist pathogens. IsdA is a multifunctional surface protein with a key role in host-pathogen interaction. Its study has revealed several novel aspects of the constant conflict between S. aureus and its human host defense mechanisms. The human skin is our largest organ and, via the presence of fatty acids and other antimicrobials, is able to resist the constant threat from potentially invading microorganisms.

Exploitation of natural fatty acids may lead to new antimicrobial compounds to help combat the tide of drug resistant pathogens.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Bacterial Strains and Plasmids Strains and plasmids are listed in Table S1. E. coli was grown on LB medium, with ampicillin (100 mg/ml) or kanamycin (50 mg/ml) where appropriate. S. aureus was grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) medium (Oxoid), chemically defined CL medium (Horsburgh et al., 2001), or iron-limited tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Oxoid) Chelex treated with addition of 10 mM 2,20 -dipyridyl (Baldassarri et al., 2001). Antibiotics used were erythromycin 5 mg/ml, lincomycin 25 mg/ml, chloramphenicol 5 mg/ml, or tetracycline 4 mg/ml. L. lactis was grown in M17 medium (Oxoid) at 30 C with 0.5% (w/v) glucose with chloramphenicol (10 mg/ml) where appropriate. All E. coli and S. aureus cultures were grown at 37 C unless otherwise stated. S. aureus 411 phage transductions were as described previously (Novick, 1967). Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbons Test (Rosenberg et al., 1980). Washed bacteria were suspended in dH2O (OD600 of 1.0). Three milliliters of bacterial suspension (grown without antibiotic selection) was placed in an acid-washed test tube and 100 ml of hexadecane added. The mixture was vortexed vigorously for 30 s and allowed to settle for 30 min. A proportion of the aqueous phase was removed with a glass pipette, the OD600 was measured, and the percent recovery was determined. Water Contact-Angle Measurements Microscope slides (19.76 cm2) were coated with 2 ml bacterial suspension (c. 23108 cfu/ml) and allowed to air dry. 200 nl of dH2O was dropped onto the dried film of bacteria using a microsyringe, and the contact angle between dH2O and bacteria was measured as described previously (Absolom, 1988). Bacterial Killing Assays Bacteria were grown to an OD600 of c. 0.6 in CL broth and were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in sterile dH2O. Cell suspensions (c. 13108 cfu/ml in dH2O) were incubated at 37 C with fatty acids or peptides (see figure legends), and cfu was determined over time. Compounds used were: hBD2 (Bachem), mCRAMP (Emory University Microchemical Facility), native PSP-B (Ryan et al., 2006),

C-6-H (Matreya), and fatty acids (capric, lauric, linoleic, and palmitoleic acid; Sigma). Human Skin Survival Model Based on a previously described method (Lacey and Lord, 1981), plastic rings (2 cm diameter) were taped to the inner forearms of healthy human volunteers (ages 23­44 years) who had refrained from applying antibacterial personal hygiene products for 24 hr. Bacteria (OD600 of c. 0.6 in CL broth) were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in sterile dH2O. Ten microliters of bacterial suspension (c. 13108 cfu/ml) was spread onto the defined area and covered with microporous tape. After 4 hr, the bacteria were washed off the skin by application of 1 ml sterile PBS and agitation using a plastic rod and enumerated by serial dilution and cfu determined. No bacteria were recovered from controls which had sterile PBS applied. Only S. aureus, which was confirmed by PCR, was recovered from volunteer skin. The model was subject to full ethical approval by the University of Sheffield (Ref: NCT04/37).
