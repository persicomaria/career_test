For example, 1-naphthyl derivative 5f had an IC50 value of 29 nM and (E)-styryl derivative 6g had an IC50 value of 3.5 nM. An X-ray structure for 5f,chymase revealed key interactions within the enzyme active site. Compound 5f was selective for inhibiting chymase versus eight serine proteases. Compound 6h was orally bioavailable in rats (F ) 39%), and orally efficacious in a hamster model of inflammation.

in terms of its component actions, we set out to identify and study selective inhibitors of Cat G and chymase. We now report on the discovery of a novel series of nonpeptide chymase inhibitors possessing a -carboxamido-phosphon(in)ic acid motif (2). This chemical series has yielded potent, selective inhibitors that exhibit useful oral bioavailability and promising antiinflammatory pharmacology.

A variety of cell types, such as neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, can play a major role in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.1 However, whereas the recruitment of such cells into injured tissues is crucial to tissue repair and host defense,2 this accumulation can also be deleterious. One source of the adverse actions is secreted proteases.3 During inflammatory events, tissue damage4 ensues when there is an excess of protease activity that overwhelms the levels of endogenous protease inhibitors.5 Consequently, the administration of exogenous inhibitors could rectify this imbalance and provide a therapeutic benefit, such as in pulmonary inflammatory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Because asthma and COPD are serious, unmet medical needs with an expanding incidence worldwide, we developed a keen interest in the serine proteases cathepsin G (EC 3.4.21.20; Cat G)4,6 and chymase (EC 3.4.21.39).6a,7 These chymotrypsin-like enzymes can degrade extracellular matrix (e.g., collagen, elastin, proteoglycans, and fibronectin), induce leukocyte migration, and promote tissue remodeling.4,6a,7a,b We recently described 1 (JNJ10311795) as a potent dual inhibitor of human Cat G (Ki ) 38 nM) and human chymase (Ki ) 2.3 nM), and established its molecular interactions in the active site of each enzyme.8 In investigating the biological properties of 1, we have observed notable activity in several animal models of inflammation.8,9 To gain a better understanding of the pharmacology, especially

The original lead compound that led us to 1 was -ketophosphonic acid 3a, which was identified via high-throughput screening for inhibitors of human Cat G.10 In exploring related structures as potential Cat G inhibitors, we prepared azahomologue 3b.11 This compound was devoid of Cat G inhibition (0% inhibition at 100 µM), but had moderate potency against human chymase (IC50 ) 190 nM).12 Because there is a close sequence homology (>50%) between Cat G and chymase, and close structural homology between their active sites (80%), 3b was modeled into the chymase active site in the mode observed for 3a,Cat G.10 Thus, the 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl groups were oriented in the S2 and S1 pockets, respectively (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The vacant, hydrophobic S3/S4 region was seen as having potential for additional binding interactions via attachment of appropriate substituents to the 3-position of the 2-naphthyl group, as exemplified in 4.10 While this approach parallels the one that we used to progress from 3a to 1, with a 100-fold potency enhancement,8 various attempts to effect this outcome with 3b met with disappointment. For example, the chymase IC50 value for 4 was >10 µM. Faced with this outcome, we decided to systematically investigate structural modifications of molecule 3b. The 1-naphthyl ring, thought to occupy the S2 subsite of chymase, was replaced by different bicyclic heterocycles. We synthesized the target compounds by the route outlined in Scheme 1, which is exemplified for 5e (Table 1). Triethylphosphite and 3-(bromomethyl)benzothiophene were heated at reflux to furnish diethyl (3-benzothienyl)methylphosphonate (57% yield),13 which was deprotonated in THF with butyllithium (2.6 M in hexane), reacted with 2-naphthylisocyanate, and deesterified with bromotrimethylsilane in pyridine to give 5e (11% yield). Considering the set of phosphonic acid compounds, 3b and 5a-g, potency for inhibition of human chymase varied over a 200-fold range (Table 1). Relative to the initial 1-naphthyl derivative, 3b, the 3-benzofuranyl (5a) and 3-indolyl (5b) analogues were less potent, the 3-benzothienyl (5e) and 3-(1methylindolyl) (5c) analogues were marginally more potent, but

the 3-(5-chlorobenzothienyl) (5f) and 3-(1-methyl-5-chloroindolyl) (5d) analogues were notably more potent (IC50 values of 29 and 13 nM, respectively). Thus, a 5-chloro group enhanced potency by a factor of 4-5 over a 5-position hydrogen. Nitrogen-linked benzotriazole 5g was essentially devoid of inhibitory activity. An X-ray crystallographic study on the 1:1 complex of 5f and human chymase was very revealing (Figures 1 and 2).14 Notably, the 5-chlorobenzothiophene group occupies the S1 pocket and the 2-naphthyl group occupies the S2 domain, which is opposite from what we had anticipated and explains why 4 is such a poor chymase inhibitor. The various close contacts that lead to important ligand-enzyme interactions are depicted in Figure 2. The phosphonate moiety is involved in a complex hydrogen-bonding network: one oxygen atom is in the oxyanion hole, interacting with Gly-193 NR and Ser-195 O; a second oxygen interacts with Ser-195 O and His-57 N ; and a third oxygen interacts with Lys-192 N . Additionally, the amide NH of the ligand forms a key hydrogen bond with the Ser-214 CdO and the amide carbonyl interacts with Lys-192 N . With this crystallographic information, we could now modify the structure of the ligand more rationally, to improve druggability (e.g., absorption/ distribution/metabolism/excretion properties) while retaining potency. In this regard, 5f exhibited low oral bioavailability in rats (F ) 3%; oral t1/2 ) 1.8 h).

One approach that we pursued was replacement of a single P-OH with a P-C group, thereby generating phosphinate analogues (Table 1, 5h-m). Although this change sacrifices a key P-O H-bond interaction (Figure 2), the crystal structure indicated that a small alkyl would be tolerated sterically. Interestingly, the phosphinates with X ) Me, 5h-j, have essentially the same potency as their phosphonate counterparts, 5d, 5f, and 3b, respectively. However, the P-Et (5k) and P-(CH2)2Ph (5m) analogues have reduced potency by a factor of 2-3, and the P-Ph analogue (5l) has reduced potency by a factor of 25. Our optimization effort was extended to a series of N-[(E)styryl] derivatives, exemplified by 6a-k (Table 2). A representative synthesis is outlined in Scheme 2. Diethyl methylphosphonite and 3-(bromomethyl)-5-chlorobenzothiophene were heated at reflux to give the intermediate phosphinate (80% yield),13 which was deprotonated in THF with butyllithium (2.6 M in hexane), reacted with 2-[(E)-3-chlorostyryl]isocyanate, and de-esterified with bromotrimethylsilane to give 6g (74% yield). The requisite isocyanate was obtained by reacting (E)-3chlorocinnamic acid and diphenyl phosphoryl azide, followed by thermal rearrangement of the intermediate acyl azide (benzene, reflux, 15 h). Replacement of the 2-naphthyl group in 5 with the (E)-styryl group in 6 worked out quite well, as the naphthyl/styryl pairs have nearly the same IC50 values (Table 2). By way of illustration, the corresponding naphthyl/styryl phosphonate pairs 5f/6a and 5d/6e have IC50 values of 29/60 and 13/16 nM; the corresponding phosphinate pairs 5i/6i and 5h/6j have IC50 values of 80/58 and 10/21 nM.15 In analogy to series 5, P-ethyl

mechanism with 6c and confirmed the absence of slow-tight binding.17 Favorable rat pharmacokinetics data were obtained for 3-chloro-5-fluoro analogue 6h (IC50 ) 17 nM; Ki ) 11 nM): F ) 39%, oral t1/2 ) 4.5 h, Cmax ) 6 µM.18 Given this good oral bioavailability, 6h was administered orally in a hamster model of inflammation.19 The test compound was dosed at 30 mg/kg, p.o., for 3 days and then at 2 h prior to carrageenan administration on day 4. In the 6h-treated hamsters, the increase in paw volume caused by carrageenan, which was marked at 4 h post challenge, was inhibited by about 50% (Figure S2). For comparison, administration of the anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone at 10 mg/kg, i.m., 2 h prior to carrageenan challenge, completely blocked the increase in paw volume (Figure S2). By manipulating our original -ketophosphonate inhibitors of human Cat G and chymase,8,10 with the aid of structure-based design, we identified a series of -carboxamido-phosphon(in)ic acids, 2, which contain potent, selective inhibitors of human mast cell chymase. For example, 2-naphthyl derivative 5f had a chymase Ki value of 36 nM and a Cat G Ki value of 9500 nM (ca. 260-fold selectivity), and (E)-styryl derivative 6g had singledigit nanomolar potency (chymase IC50 ) 3.5 nM). X-ray crystallography on 5f,chymase revealed the key interactions within the enzyme active site. Given the complex hydrogenbonding network around the phosphonate group, it was surprising that we could eliminate one of the oxygen atoms and still achieve excellent potency. This replacement and the paring down of the 2-naphthyl group to an (E)-styryl group were crucial for obtaining favorable rat pharmacokinetics. Compound 6h was not only orally bioavailable in rats (F ) 39%), but was also effective in a hamster model of inflammation on oral administration. Although useful cardiovascular pharmacology has been associated with chymase inhibitors from studies in animal models,20 our observation constitutes the first report of marked anti-inflammatory activity for a chymase inhibitor.

phosphinate 6k had a moderate reduction in potency (IC50 ) 165 nM) relative to P-methyl phosphinate 6i (IC50 ) 58 nM). We were able to achieve single-digit nanomolar potency with a phosphinate moiety, as shown for 3-chloro analogue 6g (IC50 ) 3.5 nM). It is noteworthy that such high potency is possible while using only two P-O groups. In this subclass, going from a phosphonate to a phosphinate may leave the potency unchanged (cf. 3b and 5j) or cause a moderate 5-fold loss in potency (cf. 6c and 6i). Remarkably, the carbon-carbon double bond was very critical for potent chymase inhibition: whereas 6i has an IC50 of 58 nM, saturated analogue 7 has an IC50 of 10 400 nM (180-fold less potent). Thus, a certain geometry and conformational constraint is required for optimal interactions in the S2 region. Chymase inhibitor 5f (IC50 ) 29 nM) was examined for enzyme selectivity with a panel of eight serine proteases. It displayed high selectivity versus Cat G (IC50 ) 12 µM), chymotrypsin (NA), trypsin (IC50 ) 12 µM), -tryptase (NA), R-thrombin (NA), factor Xa (NA), factor VIIa, and leukocyte elastase (NA).16 The enzyme kinetics for chymase inhibition showed Michaelis-Menten competitive behavior. In the case of 5f, a Ki value of 36 nM was measured. Comparing Ki values (Table 1, footnote c), the selectivity of 5f for chymase over Cat G was about 260-fold. We tested the chymase inhibition
