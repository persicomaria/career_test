ABSTRACT: The metalloenzyme glyoxalase I (GlxI) converts the nonenzymatically produced hemimercaptal of cytotoxic methylglyoxal and glutathione to nontoxic S-D-lactoylglutathione. Human GlxI, for which the structure is known, is active in the presence of Zn2+. Unexpectedly, the Escherichia coli enzyme is inactive in the presence of Zn2+ and is maximally active with Ni2+. To understand this difference in metal activation and also to obtain a representative of the bacterial enzymes, the structure of E. coli Ni2+-GlxI has been determined. Structures have also been determined for the apo enzyme as well as complexes with Co2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+. It is found that each of the protein-metal complexes that is catalytically active has octahedral geometry. This includes the complexes of the E. coli enzyme with Ni2+, Co2+, and Cd2+, as well as the structures reported for the human Zn2+ enzyme. Conversely, the complex of the E. coli enzyme with Zn2+ has trigonal bipyramidal coordination and is inactive. This mode of coordination includes four protein ligands plus a single water molecule. In contrast, the coordination in the active forms of the enzyme includes two water molecules bound to the metal ion, suggesting that this may be a key feature of the catalytic mechanism. A comparison of the human and E. coli enzymes suggests that there are differences between the active sites that might be exploited for therapeutic use.

Although metal ions play an important role in many enzyme-catalyzed reactions (1), the respective roles that are played by the metal ions themselves and the surrounding ligands are often poorly understood (2-8). A case in point is glyoxalase I, which, as explained below, has unexpected variability in its response to the binding of different metals, depending on the source of the enzyme. Glyoxalase I (GlxI; S-D-lactoylglutathione lyase, EC 4.4.1.5),1 the first of two enzymes in the pathway to convert cytotoxic R-keto aldehydes, such as methylglyoxal, into nontoxic R-hydroxycarboxylic acids, requires a metal ion for catalytic activity (9). This enzyme system is important in that an increase in methylglyoxal can produce toxic effects by reacting with DNA, RNA, and proteins (10-13). This toxicity can be exploited by inhibitors designed to target GlxI and has been utilized in the design of anticancer and antimalarial agents (13-15). Similarly, specific inhibitors for the bacterial GlxI may be effective antibiotics (10). In Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cereVisiae, and Pseudomonas putida GlxI, the essential metal has been shown to

be zinc (16-18). In contrast, however, GlxI from E. coli is completely inactive in the presence of this ion. Maximal activity is found in the presence of Ni2+, and reduced activity is found with Co2+, Cd2+, and Mn2+ (19, 20). This was especially puzzling given the relatively high amino acid sequence homology between the enzymes. The structure of human GlxI has been reported (21) and has indicated it to be a member of the so-called R superfamily of metalloproteins (22). It is the only eukaryotic protein from the family whose structure has been determined and is somewhat remote from the known bacterial members of this family. To obtain information on a representative bacterial enzyme, the structure of E. coli GlxI has been determined. Also, to ameliorate our knowledge of proteinnickel interactions, an area of current interest in metalloenzymology (23-25), and to try to understand why the human and E. coli enzymes have very different metal requirements, the structure of the E. coli enzyme was determined in the apo form as well as in complex with nickel, cobalt, cadmium, and zinc. The results suggest that it is the geometry of metal coordination, rather than the metal ion itself, that correlates with catalytic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. HEPES was purchased from BDH (Toronto, ON), and seleno-L-methionine (SeMet) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. All other reagents used in the growth and purification of the enzyme were described previously (19). Ampicillin and carbenicillin were used at a concentration of 50 µg/mL in Luria-Bertani broth and 30 µg/mL in minimal media M9 (26).

Protein Production and Purification. Native E. coli MG1655/pGL10 was grown, GlxI was expressed, and the protein was purified as described (19). For incorporation of SeMet, M9 (supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.001% uracil, and 5 µM NiCl2) was inoculated with E. coli MG1655/pGL10 grown in LBAmp. SeMet (0.3 mM) and additional NiCl2 (7.5 µM) was added to the culture when the OD600 reached 0.5. Following 30 min additional growth at 37 °C, GlxI synthesis was induced for 8 h with IPTG (0.5 mM). The cells were harvested and the protein was purified in the same manner as described for the native enzyme (19). SeMet incorporation was monitored by electrospray mass spectrometry, provided by the Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Waterloo. Enzyme Preparation for Crystallization. The precipitated protein following isoelectric focusing has the highest purity and was utilized for all crystallographic work. The protein (in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, Chelex treated, Na+ form) was concentrated using an Amicon Centricon concentrator (YM10; Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the buffer was changed to 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 (Chelex treated). For the various metalsubstituted forms of the enzyme, 2-2.5 mol equiv of metal (NiCl2, ZnCl2, CdCl2, CoCl2, or MnCl2) were added to the dimeric apoenzyme, prior to concentration. The enzyme was concentrated to between 12 and 37 mg/mL. Concentration was determined utilizing the Bradford assay (27) with bovine albumin as the standard, and enzyme activities were performed as previously described (19). Protein samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C in eppendorf tubes. Tubes were soaked in 10% nitric acid for 30 min to remove any extraneous metals followed by liberal rinsing with Chelex-treated water. Crystallization of Ni2+-, Co2+-, Cd2+-, Zn2+-, Apo-, and SeMet-Ni2+-GlxI. The various metal-bound forms of native GlxI were readily crystallized by vapor diffusion in hanging drops with PEG 1000 and PEG 8000 as a precipitant. The protein solution (5 µL of 12-37 mg/mL) was mixed with an equal volume of well liquor containing 5-10% PEG 1000 and 5-10% PEG 8000. After approximately one week at room temperature, crystals of dimensions 0.8 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm appeared. Although the apo-GlxI protein gave crystals under similar conditions, they appeared to be less stable.

More stable crystals with better morphology were obtained by placing the trays at 4 °C for 2 weeks or longer. The crystals of SeMet-Ni2+-GlxI could only be obtained when additional buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0) was added to the hanging drops containing 11 mg/mL protein, and they differed in morphology from the native GlxI crystals. In addition, these crystals diffracted very poorly until subjected to one or more cycles of crystal annealing (28, 29). The crystals were flash-cooled in a stream of cold nitrogen and then transferred to mother liquor with 30% PEG 400 at room temperature. After a 1-min incubation the crystals were flashcooled again in the presence of 30% PEG 400. Data Collection and Structure Determination. The diffraction data for native Ni2+- and apo-GlxI were collected on beamline 9-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The data for the crystals of Co2+-, Cd2+-, and Zn2+-GlxI were recorded under cryo conditions on a Rigaku R-AXIS imaging plate mounted on a rotating anode source. All native GlxI data sets were integrated and scaled using the Mosflm and Scala package (31). Four data sets of SeMetNi2+-GlxI crystals were collected at different wavelengths, maximizing the K-edge anomalous dispersion effects of selenium, on beamline 5-2 at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA). These data sets were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (32). Data collection statistics can be seen in Table 1. The space group of native GlxI crystals was determined to be P21 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. In contrast, the SeMet-Ni2+-GlxI crystals grew in space group P212121 with six molecules per asymmetric unit. Attempts to determine the structure of the native E. coli enzyme in space group P21 using molecular replacement based on the human enzyme (21) were unsuccessful. This led to the use of the selenomethionine form which, as noted, crystallized in a different space group. The positions of the 12 Se sites were determined by Shake 'n Bake (33). The program SHARP (34) was used to refine the positions of the Se sites and to calculate the experimental electron density map. The phasing statistics can be seen in Table 1. Model Building, Refinement, and Analysis. The model of SeMet-Ni2+-GlxI was built with the program O (35, 36). The noncrystallographic symmetry operators relating the three dimers in the asymmetric unit were determined using O and refined with CNS_Solve (37). Refinement of the structure

was first carried out using CNS_Solve (37). This involved a combination of simulated annealing (38) interspersed with manual rebuilding into maps averaged using RAVE (39). Further refinement was carried out using TNT (40). Five percent of the total reflections from thin shells were excluded from the refinement process and used to calculate R-free (41). Strict noncrystallographic symmetry was maintained throughout, until R had dropped to 25% and R-free had dropped to 30%. At this stage, the model was used in a molecular replacement search (42) leading to the successful determination of the GlxI structure in the P21 crystal form. This not only made it possible to refine (40) the structures of the various metal-substituted forms of the enzyme but also to take advantage of the higher resolution data obtainable for these crystals. The structure validation program PROCHECK (43) shows that the final models for all structures have reasonable geometry, with good root-mean-square (RMS) deviation from target values (Table 2; 44). The presence and absence of the metal-bound water was confirmed by the calculation of omit-maps. Overlay of the structures was done by using program EDPDB on the basis of least-squares fitting (45). Electrostatic potentials were calculated and the molecular surfaces were displayed by using the program GRASP (46). The metal ions in both E. coli and H. sapiens GlxI proteins and the inhibitor ligand in the H. sapiens GlxI were excluded from these calculations. RESULTS OVerall Structure. The 135-amino acid native E. coli GlxI structure is composed of two identical subunits and has an overall fold similar to that of the 184-amino acid H. sapiens

enzyme (21). Each subunit is itself made up of two domains (residues 3-60 and 72-126) that are linked by an intervening segment of 12 residues (Figure 1A). Each of these domains is composed of a R motif forming a mixed -sheet (Figure 1A). The sequence of the strands within the sheet is 1 4 3 2. Within their respective "core" regions, the two domains have quite similar structures (e.g., the CR atoms of residues 3-36 and 72-97 superimpose within 0.3 Å). The solvent-exposed loops connecting strands 2 and 3 (residues 36-38 and 104-107) and 3 and 4 (residues 4751 and 115-119), however, have very different conformations (Figure 2A). In the dimer, the 1 strand of the first domain from subunit A associates in an antiparallel fashion with the 1 strand from the second domain of subunit B. This leads to a curved 8-stranded -sheet (Figure 1B). A reciprocal interaction

between the second domain of subunit A and the first domain of subunit B leads to a second curved -sheet. The two metalbinding sites per dimer are located within these curved -sheets. The two monomers are very close in structure (Figure 2B), their CR atoms being superimposable within 0.47 Å. To compare the conformation in the vicinity of the two active sites, the first domain from the first monomer plus the second domain from the second monomer was overlaid on to the second domain from the first monomer plus the first domain from the second monomer (Figure 2C). In this case, the RMS deviation of the CR atoms is only about 0.54 Å with the largest difference in the loop regions from residues Gln91-

Gly94 and Val103-Thr108. The CR atoms in these two loops have B factors ranging from 40 to 70 Å2, significantly higher than the average value of 19.5 Å2 for the protein as a whole (Figure 3). Higher backbone B factors were also found for the same two loops in SeMet-Ni2+-GlxI, whose structure was solved in space group P212121 (data not shown). The high B factors of the two loops in both crystal packing environments indicate their flexibility. The B factors of residues 91-94 in subunit A are about 25 Å2 higher than those in subunit B for all the GlxI structures solved in space group P21. This is consistent with the observation that residues 91-94 in subunit B are involved in crystal contacts, while the same residues in subunit A are exposed to the solvent. Although the loop formed by residues 103-108, which is "above" the active site, is very mobile, the backbone in the vicinity of the metal-binding residues is among the most rigid part of the entire protein (Figure 3). Toward the carboxy-terminus of the molecule the electron density could be followed clearly until Glu126, at which point it became much weaker. It could, however, still be followed until it entered the active site of an adjacent molecule in the crystal. At this point, the density became much stronger and could be modeled as Gly134-Asn135, the two residues at the carboxy-terminus of the protein. The intervening electron density between Glu126 and Gly134 is long enough to account for the intervening seven residues, but was not sufficiently well-defined to permit the inclusion of these residues in the final model. Metal Coordination. Although biochemical data have suggested that only one metal ion per dimer is required to fully activate the protein (19), two such ions are seen at essentially equivalent positions (Figure 1B). In the native E. coli Ni2+-GlxI structure, four protein residues (His5 and Glu56 from one monomer and His74 and Glu122 from the other) and two water molecules are coordinated to the nickel (Figure 4A). Very similar ligation is seen in the two active sites. The coordination around the nickel ion is octahedral with close to ideal geometry (Figure 5, Tables 3 and 4). The metal lies in the plane defined by N of the two histidine residues and the two water molecules. Monodentate coordination is seen for each of the two axial carboxylates. Substitution of different metal ions in the active site of GlxI does not change the overall structure of the protein. The Co2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ enzymes have a CR RMS deviation not exceeding 0.3 Å when compared to Ni2+-GlxI. The changes that do occur are

The density shown is from a map calculated with amplitudes (2Fo-Fc) where Fo and Fc are, respectively, the observed structure amplitudes and those calculated from the final refined structure. The resolution is 1.5 Å for Ni2+-GlxI and 1.8 Å for Zn2+-GlxI. The octahedral arrangement of the nickel ligands and the trigonal bipyramidal coordination of the zinc ligands can be clearly seen. No distances or angle restrains were applied to the coordination geometry during refinement. Figures were prepared using Bobscript (59).

localized to the immediate vicinity of the metal sites. As with the native nickel enzyme, the enzymatically active Co2+ and Cd2+ derivatives also exhibit octahedral coordination. The coordination distances are somewhat longer (Table 3), consistent with the increased radii of Co2+ and Cd2+ as compared to Ni2+ (47). In contrast, the inactive Zn2+ derivative displays trigonal bipyramidal coordination with the same four protein ligands plus a single water molecule (Figures 4B and 5B). The geometries of the zinc ions in the two active sites are slightly different. In one case, the zincbound water superimposes on one of the two water ligands in the nickel complex and has close-to-perfect trigonal bipyramidal geometry. In the other active site, the water does not superimpose on either of the water ligands of the Ni2+structure resulting in distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination. The overall structure of apo-GlxI is very similar to that of the metal-bound forms. The RMS discrepancy of the CR atoms relative to the nickel enzyme is 0.32 Å. This is

consistent with the circular dichroism spectrum, which does not suggest any significant structural change upon addition of Ni2+ ions to the apoenzyme (19). There are some changes in the immediate vicinity of the metal sites. In the apoenzyme, the metal ligands are somewhat more loosely packed, and the two glutamates are directed away from the vacant sites. DISCUSSION On the basis of sequence similarity with the H. sapiens, S. cereVisiae, and P. putida GlxI enzymes, all of which require Zn2+ (16, 18), E. coli GlxI might have been expected to be a zinc metalloenzyme. The E. coli enzyme does, in fact, bind Zn2+ (as shown here) but is inactive in the presence of this ion. It does, however, display activity with Ni2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and Mn2+ (19). Comparison with Human GlxI and Other Members of the R Superfamily. The primary sequence of H. sapiens GlxI contains 184 amino acids (17), the N-terminal Met being lost in the active enzyme. Subsequent references to H. sapiens GlxI residue numbers refer to the intact 184 amino acid sequence. Following the recent determination of the H. sapiens GlxI crystal structure (21), a novel protein R superfamily was identified (22). Despite very low sequence homology and no similarity in enzymatic function, H. sapiens GlxI has been shown to be structurally related to the bacterial bleomycin resistance protein (BRP) from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus (48) and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia (49). The fosfomycin resistance protein (FosA), a Mn2+-dependent glutathione-S-transferase, has also been suggested to be a member of this superfamily (50). A detailed analysis of the structural similarities and postulated evolution of this family of enzymes has been given by Bergdoll et al. (22). With the exception of FosA, which has not been structurally characterized, all members of the R family have overall structures that are much more similar to that of E. coli GlxI than to that of human GlxI. Therefore, the determination of the structure of the E. coli enzyme provides a more representative member of the family as a whole. As expected, the overall structure of E. coli GlxI is similar to that of its human counterpart (21). There are, however, several substantive differences. A 29-amino acid N-terminal

arm which wraps around the adjacent subunit in the H. sapiens protein is absent in the E. coli enzyme as well as in other bacterial members of the R family. This extended arm may help to stabilize the dimeric form of the human enzyme, although its absence in the E. coli enzyme shows that such an arm is not essential for dimer formation. Since this arm lies mostly on the surface of the enzyme its absence is not expected to substantially perturb the rest of the structure. Another difference is that E. coli GlxI has a significantly larger active site. In the human enzyme, the active site consists of a largely hydrophobic pocket of volume about 70 Å3. In contrast, the active site in the E. coli enzyme consists of a deep solvent channel about 10-15 Å in diameter (Figure 6). This increase in solvent accessibility is predominantly due to the deletion of a 15-amino acid segment that would lie approximately between residues 5152 in the bacterial protein. This deletion eliminates an R-helix and a loop that lies along the side of the active site in the human enzyme. As a result, the active site of E. coli GlxI may have a very different response to inhibitors and substrates. These are being explored by studies of mutant enzymes and inhibitor complexes. Two smaller regions (residues 107-111 and 120-123 in H. sapiens GlxI) not present in the E. coli enzyme correspond to small loops lying between the two R motifs. These differences are mirrored within the other known superfamily members and suggest the E. coli enzyme is more similar to the other known members of the superfamily than is the H. sapiens GlxI. The presumed evolution of this family of enzymes has been discussed by Bergdoll et al. (22). The four C-terminal residues of E. coli GlxI (Gly132Asn135) can be proteolytically removed without affecting catalytic activity (19). In the electron density map, the residues following Glu126 cannot be traced accurately due to weak electron density, with the exception of the final two residues (Gly134-Asn135), which bind within the active site of an adjacent protein molecule in the crystal. The mobility of the C-terminal region explains its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. Analysis of the B factors of the E. coli GlxI structure (Figure 3) reveals two additional regions with higher than average mobility, namely, residues 91-94 and 104-106. The second region lies "above" the active site,

suggesting a possible involvement in substrate binding. There is some evidence for this in the recent structure determination of the H. sapiens GlxI with a proposed transition state analogue (51), which indicates that CR of Lys157 moves 3 Å toward the active site. This residue is located within a loop that corresponds to Pro102-Val103-Lys104-Gly105Gly106-Thr107-Thr108-Val109 in the E. coli enzyme. Thus, Lys104 in the E. coli enzyme may play a role similar to Lys157 in the human enzyme. Metal Binding Sites. The structures presented here show that each of the active forms of E. coli GlxI has an octahedral metal coordination, with two participating water molecules. Electron paramagnetic resonance indicates that the Mn2+substituted enzyme, which is active, is also octahedrally coordinated (Markham, G. D., Clugston, S. L. and Honek, J. F., unpublished results). However, X-ray analysis of the enzyme cocrystallized or soaked in up to 5 mM Mn2+ showed weak electron density at the metal binding sites, suggesting that the affinity for this ion in the crystal is low. Direct comparison with the metal coordination of the active Zn2+ H. sapiens enzyme is difficult as the structure lacking an inhibitor has not yet been reported. However, the available inhibitor complexes indicate that Zn2+ is coordinated by four protein ligands (Gln34, Glu100, His127, Glu173) plus one or possibly two water molecules with square pyramidal or octahedral geometry. Liganding with the inhibitor substitutes for the binding of the second water molecule in some cases (21, 51, 52). In the case of the E. coli enzyme, the two residues at the carboxy-terminus of one molecule bind within the active site of an adjacent molecule in the crystal. The location and mode of binding is similar to that of benzyl-GSH cocrystallized in the active site of the H. sapiens GlxI (Figure 7). In particular, O11 and N1 of benzyl-GSH form hydrogen bonds with N2 and O1 of Asn104 that mimic those between O and N2 of Asn135 and Asn60 in the E. coli GlxI enzyme. The presence of these two amino acids in the active site does not, however, appear to contribute to or to directly influence the ligation at the metal site.

Even though human and E. coli GlxI have homologous amino acid sequences and similar three-dimensional structures, they do not have identical metal ligands. As shown in Figure 5, Gln34 of the human enzyme is replaced with a histidine in E. coli GlxI. In the absence of structural information, this variability might have suggested that this is a nonessential amino acid. Even with the knowledge of the respective structures, it might suggest that the presence of the glutamine would correlate with a requirement for zinc while the histidine ligand would correlate with the use of nickel. This, however, cannot be the case since the S. cereVisiae and P. putida GlxI enzymes are active with zinc yet use histidine as a metal ligand (20). The key factor responsible for activity, therefore, seems to be geometry. Previous studies of the zinc endopeptidase astacin have revealed a relationship between the geometry around the metal center and enzymatic activity of various metalsubstituted forms of the enzyme (53). Trigonal bipyramidal ligation was observed for each of the three active forms of the enzyme, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Co2+, whereas octahedral coordination occurred for the Ni2+ enzyme and tetrahedral for Hg2+-astacin, both of which were inactive. The results suggested that the correct orientation of metal-liganded water molecules was necessary for catalytic activity. In the case of asticin, Zn2+ and Co2+ give the appropriate orientation, while Ni2+ does not. The structural analysis of E. coli GlxI displays a similar correlation between geometry and activity except that in this case Ni2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ appear to have the correct orientation of bound water molecules, while Zn2+ does not. Reaction Mechanism. On the basis of solvent isotope exchange studies on the S. cereVisiae enzyme, the overall mechanism of GlxI has been proposed to involve proton abstraction, formation of an enediol(ate), with reprotonation at the adjacent carbon (54). A specific mechanism has been proposed based on the recent crystallographic studies of H. sapiens GlxI in the presence of a putative transition state analogue (51). In this mechanism, it is proposed that the sixcoordinate zinc, including two water ligands, becomes five-

Benzyl-GSH, which is bound to the human enzyme, is shown in blue with its hydrogen bonds to Asn shown as dotted lines.

coordinate upon substrate binding. The two oxygen atoms of the substrate (seen with the enediol inhibitor) replace the two water ligands. The binding of the substrate is also proposed to displace the zinc ligand Glu173, which is then free to act as the catalytic base. On the basis of the present knowledge of the crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme, a related mechanism could be proposed, i.e., it could be envisaged that Glu122 in the E. coli enzyme, the counterpart of Glu173, would be displaced from the metal on substrate binding and act as the catalytic base. There are, however, a number of uncertainties. For example, while an incoming substrate might be envisaged to displace a glutamate from zinc, it would be less likely to do so for nickel (53). In principle, the following mechanisms might be considered for E. coli GlxI, based on our current structural knowledge: (i) The substrate (or transition state) might displace a single water molecule plus Glu122, such that a six-coordinate metal is still present and allows for the production of the general catalytic base, Glu122, analogous to that proposed for the H. sapiens enzyme. (ii) On the basis of the octahedral geometry for all the activating metals for E. coli, a mechanism that utilizes the two water molecules to polarize and possibly serve in the proton abstraction could be proposed. Previous work on the H. sapiens enzyme has indicated the importance of two water molecules directly interacting with the substrate (55, 56). (iii) Both water molecules might be displaced from the metal and an additional unspecified specific or general base might participate. However, the only putative general base present in the active site is Glu49, which is approximately 8.0 Å from the metal center. In the absence of fairly substantial structural

changes, the involvement of Glu49 would seem doubtful. The most remarkable feature of the present study is the correlation between catalytic activity and the coordination at the metal binding site. Each of the protein-metal complexes that has octahedral (6-fold) geometry yields an active enzyme. This includes the complexes of the E. coli enzyme with Ni2+, Co2+, and Cd2+, as well as the structures reported for the human Zn2+ enzyme. Conversely, the complex of the E. coli enzyme with Zn2+ has trigonal bipyramidal (5-fold) coordination and is inactive. It would seem clear that octahedral geometry is a prerequisite for activity. Why is this the case? Two possible reasons can be suggested. First, it may be that a rather special geometry is required to have a glutamic acid (e.g., Glu173 in the human enzyme) act as both a metal ligand and as a catalytic base (assuming it does, in fact, fulfill both roles). Second, it may be that the mechanism of action requires that two water molecules be bound to the metal ion either in the resting enzyme or at some time during catalysis. Six-fold coordination would allow four protein ligands plus two such water molecules, but this would not be the case for 5-fold metal ligation (Figure 5). ACKNOWLEDGMENT M. He thanks Drs.
