The X-ray crystal structure analysis of inducer-free Tet repressor, TetR, at Ê 2.4 A resolution identi®es one of two openings of the tunnel-like binding site as the entrance for the inducer tetracycline-Mg2, [Mg Tc]. Recognition and binding of the inducer unleashes conformational changes leading to the induced state of TetR. In the ®rst step, the C-terminal turn of a-helix 6 unwinds, thereby altering the orientation of a-helix 4. This different orientation of a-helix 4 is stabilized by a series of hydrogen bonds mediated through a chain of eight water molecules. The a-helix 4 connects the DNA-binding domain (a-helices 1 to 3) to the rigid TetR core, and thus regulates gene expression through its respective orientations.

Introduction
The most frequently observed tetracycline (Tc) resistance mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria is the active Tc ef¯ux through the cytoplasmic membrane mediated by the antiporter protein TetA, which prevents Tc from binding to its ribosomal target. TetA is a membrane embedded-pump, which exports a complex of Tc and a divalent cation, e.g. [Mg Tc] (Figure 1), coupled to equimolar uptake of a proton (Yamaguchi et al., 1990). Expression of the tetA gene is under negative control of the Tet repressor, TetR, which binds to operator DNA preventing transcription of tetR and tetA. [Mg Tc]-binding induces conformational changes in TetR, resulting in its release from the operator sites, thereby initiating expression. Tc-resistance determinants with these properties occur in at least seven variants (classes A to E, G

Crystal structures of induced TetR of class D, TetR(D), in complex with tetracycline, 7HTc (Hinrichs et al., 1994), and 7-chlorotetracycline, 7ClTc (Kisker et al., 1995), as reported previously revealed an all-a-helical TetR-homodimer with a-helix-turn-a-helix motifs located within the N-terminal three-helix bundles of the DNA-binding domains (a1 to a3 and symmetry-related a1H to a3H ). The DNA-recognition helices (a3 and a3H ) are Ê separated by 39 A, which is too wide to allow binding of TetR to adjacent major grooves of the Ê operator DNA with 34 A distance. In a ®rst tentative formulation of the induction mechanism, we proposed that [Mg Tc]-binding in the protein core induces a see-saw and lever-like mechanism mediated by helix a4, based on the fact that a4 connects the DNA-binding domain to the protein core (Hinrichs et al., 1994; Kisker et al., 1995). The locations and properties of many non-inducible TetR mutants have, in addition, suggested a role in the induction process for the loop preceding a6, a6 and a9, and the central four-helix bundle (a8, a10, a8H and a10H ) located in the core of the dimer È (Muller et al., 1995). Here, we describe the crystal structure analysis Ê of an inducer-free TetR(D)-mutant at 2.4 A resolution. Comparison of the structures of induced and inducer-free TetR reveals several conformational

Results and Discussion
The TetR-variant For the structure determination of a Tc-free TetR we crystallized a TetR(BD) chimera, which consists of the TetR(D) protein core carrying the TetR(B) sequence in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and differs from TetR(D) by only ten amino acid residues, see Figure 2. The stop codon was placed at position 209 to truncate the last ten residues, since their cleavage from the wild-type protein is essential for crystal growth (Kisker et al., 1995). The inducer-free TetR(BD) crystallizes isomorphously to TetR(D) and to corresponding Tc complexes, with a remarkable improvement in the X-ray diffraction pattern extending the resolution Ê to 2.4 A resolution, as opposed to inducer-free TetR(D) or TetR(B) crystals, which diffract to about Ê 2.8 A. The in vivo repression and induction ef®ciences of TetR(BD) are identical with TetR(B) and even enhanced compared to TetR(D) (Schnappinger et al., 1998). Crystal structure The asymmetric unit contains one monomer of TetR(BD), because the dyad of the biologically active TetR homodimer coincides with a crystallographic 2-fold axis (Figure 3). The 207 residues polypeptide chain (residues 2 to 208) is folded into ten a-helices, denoted a1 to a10. The N-terminal three-helix-bundles a1 to a3 and the symmetry-

changes that occur upon [Mg Tc]-binding. A detailed description of the entrance, recognition and binding of [Mg Tc] to the narrow binding pocket and a model of the induction mechanism are presented. The previously published structures of TetR(D)/ [Mg 7HTc] and TetR(D)/[Mg 7ClTc] will be denoted by their Brookhaven Protein Data Bank codes 2TRT and 2TCT, respectively.

Figure 3. Overall structure of the induced form of TetR(D), 2TCT. The two monomers are coloured yellow and orange. Major structural differences of the superimposed TetR(BD) are indicated in blue. These include the loop connecting a6 and a7, the N-terminal part of a7, and the entire length of a9. The C-terminal turn of a8 is unwound in the inducer-free TetR(BD) (not marked). The adjacent disordered loop connection (residues 152 to 165) to a9 is coloured pink. The 7ClTc is shown in red with a blue Mg2-sphere. Figures 3, 6, 7 and 8 were created with SETOR (Evans, 1993).

related a1H to a3H , together constitute the DNAbinding domains. a2, a3 form the a-helix-turna-helix motif, HTH, of the DNA-binding domain, which is connected to the core by a4. The core of the TetR homodimer is formed by a5 to a10 and a5H to a10H , and harbours two symmetry-related Tc-binding sites, each formed by both polypeptide chains. The monomers are clearly separated, merely a disordered loop and the adjacent a9 wrap around the other half of the core domain in a hand-shake fashion. The central part of the core is formed by the antiparallel a8 and a10 in combination with their symmetry-related counterparts a8H and a10H . These pairs of long a-helices are positioned at an angle of $50 , typical of the È globin fold (Branden & Tooze, 1991). Each of the two [Mg Tc]-binding sites forms a continuous tunnel buried entirely within the TetR core; the ®rst is de®ned by a-helices 4 to 8, 8H and 9H , the second by 4H to 8H , 8 and 9. Each tunnel has two openings to the bulk solvent. One is C-terminal to a4, at a position where the Tc-ring A forms hydrogen bonds to His64; the other is next to the C terminus of a9H , where the Tc-ring D is in van der Waals contact with side-chains of Leu174H and Met177H of a9H . Comparison of the induced and inducer-free TetR Superposition of the Tc-free TetR(BD) structure with the induced form of TetR(D), 2TCT, shows signi®cant structural differences; the overall r.m.s. deviations for main-chain atoms amounting to Ê 1.13 A. Induction causes large displacements of up

Ê to 4 A including the C-terminal part of a6, the adjacent loop connecting a6 to a7, as well as the N-terminal part of a7; furthermore, a9 is displaced Ê by about 2.4 A as a unit, see Figure 4(a). The C-terminal turn of a6 is converted into a type II b-turn following Mg2 coordination, while a8 is extended C-terminally by one turn and the N-terminal turn of a7 adopts 310-helical conformation on induction. Small displacements of the DNA-binding domain and a4 are also observed. The most rigid part of TetR(BD) is represented by a5 and the core helices a8 and a10. The observed differences between the two structures are accompanied by greater ¯exibility of the inducer-free TetR(BD), as indicated by increased thermal parameters (Figure 4(b)), which are generally larger in Tc-free TetR(BD) than in 2TCT. Identification of the entrance of the [Mg Tc]-binding tunnel Under physiological conditions, the inducer exists and binds to TetR as a [Mg Tc]-complex (Takahashi et al., 1986; Jogun & Stezowski, 1976). The narrow openings of the binding tunnel necessitate an initial directed insertion of the inducer with either Tc-ring A or D. For a comparison of the openings, see Figure 5. In Tc-free TetR(BD), the opening next to the C-terminus of a9H is twice as large as that C-terminal to a4. Whereas the latter remains almost unchanged upon [Mg Tc]-binding, the opening at a9H narrows signi®cantly as a result of the movement of a9H . The docking of [Mg Tc] induces a lateral motion of a9H comparable to a ``sliding door'' (Figure 3). The r.m.s. positional

(a) Empty binding pocket of the entrance near a9H (Met177H , Asp178H ). At the far end of the tunnel the opposite opening, the ``open backdoor'', is visible. (b) After [Mg Tc] -insertion the entrance is closed by movement of a9H . The other side of the binding tunnel C-terminal to a4 (His 63) is almost unchanged (c) before and (d) after [Mg Tc]-binding.

Ê deviation for main-chain atoms of a9 is 2.43 A; this is in sharp contrast to an r.m.s. deviation for mainchain atoms near the opening at the C-terminus of a4, which is in the range of the mean absolute Ê coordinate error (Luzzati, 1952) of 0.35 A, see Figure 4(a). We consequently conclude that the opening next to the C-terminus of a9H serves as the entrance to the bnding site. This requires [Mg Tc] to insert head-on with ring A forming hydrogen bonds to side-chains of His64 (C-terminal to a4), Asn82 and Phe86 (both on a5), and Gln116 (a7), which are located near a4 close to the narrow opening at the far end of the tunnel. We refer to this opening as the ``open backdoor'', presumably required for water release during inducer binding. Even after Tc docking, the entrance is not closed completely. This con®rms earlier observations from soaking the crystals of 2TRT with heavy-atom compounds for multiple isomorphous replacement (Hinrichs et al., 1994; Kisker et al., 1995).

[Au(CN)2]À, Hg2, and [Pt Br4]2- were found to coordinate to Met177 (a9) and His139 (a8) in the tunnel next to Tc-ring D. The same binding site was identi®ed for bulkier heavy atom compounds of this type, like [Hg I4]2- and alkyl-Hg (data not shown). These derivatives resulted in poor isoÊ morphism in the higher resolution ranges (45 A), which can be explained by structural changes at the entrance of the tunnel associated with displacement of a9. Modelling the [Mg Tc]-recognition of TetR Independent modelling studies were performed with rigid body docking to corroborate the identi®cation of the entrance of the [Mg Tc]-binding tunnel. The starting model consisted of the polypeptide of the homodimeric TetR(BD) (this work) and the inducer [Mg 7HTc]. The solvent space was mimicked by an appropriate dielectric medium. The calculated electrostatic potential of the TetR(BD) was used for a ``guided walk'' of the [Mg 7HTc] towards the protein. Final proteinligand orientations were collected according to a Boltzmann criterion. The most favoured positions for the inducer were found to be next to the two entrances at a9 and a9H , respectively. Other attractive potentials on the protein surface for additional

[Mg Tc]-recognition and changes leading to induction After passing the entrance of the binding tunnel, speci®c [Mg Tc]-recognition triggers a sequence of events (a to e, see Figure 6), including conformational changes that result in the narrowing of the binding pocket and the reorientation of a4, required for a changed af®nity of TetR for the operator-DNA. Event a The functional groups amide O21, enolate O3 and dimethylammonium N4 of Tc-ring A form tight hydrogen bonds to His64 (a4), Asn82(a5) and Gln116 (a7). These residues are identical in position and orientation in the Tc-bound and Tc-free TetR, and may be assumed to constitute the ®rst speci®c recognition targets of TetR. Event b In the inducer-free TetR(BD), a6 comprises residues 96 to 102; this is shortened to residues 96 to 100 in the induced structure. Mg2-binding to the imidazole group of His100 triggers the formation of a type II b-turn, His100 to Thr103, at the expense of the C-terminal turn of a6. His100 remains in position, but the Ca positions of Gly102 Ê and Thr103 are displaced by 3.92 and 3.12 A, g respectively. Hydrogen bonding of Thr103 O to a Mg2-coordinated water molecule supports formation of the b-turn. This induced ®t identi®es the

[Mg 7HTc] were found near the C terminus and between the HTH motifs, but the backdoor next to a4 does not show such a potential and therefore is not recognized by the inducer molecules. This simulation clearly supports the identi®cation of the opening C-terminal to a9 as the entrance of the binding tunnel for the antibiotic. Flexibility of the loop connecting a 8 and a 9 The mobility of a9 is supported by the ¯exibility of the loop connecting a8 and a9. This oligopeptide segment is disordered in all known TetR crystal structures, and was not modelled because the corresponding regions of the electron density maps were poorly de®ned. In 2TRT and 2TCT the loop comprises residues 156 to 164, but in the inducerfree TetR(BD) this disordered segment is extended and covers residues 152 to 165. One C-terminal turn of a8 and residue 165 at the end of the loop, N-terminal to a9, became more ¯exible, as indicated by weak and uninterpretable portions of the electron density map in TetR(BD). Alignment of the seven known TetR sequences indicates that, apart from C-terminal sequence variations, this loop is the least conserved region and the only part where deletions or insertions are found. The amino acid composition of this loop gives rise to a net negative charge in all TetR sequences, indicating a supporting role in [Mg Tc]-capture. Deletions in this loop lead to reduced [Mg Tc] af®nity of TetR mutants, correlating with lack of inducibility. In contrast, sequence variations by substitutions to alanine show minor effects only (Berens et al., 1997). A suf®cient length of this loop is important for the transition of the open TetR

The induced stepwise conformational changes are marked a to e (see the text). [Mg 7ClTc] enters the binding tunnel through the entrance next to (9 in a direct fashion. Tc-ring A hydrogen bonds to His64, Asn82 and Gln116 (event a). After Mg2-coordination (event b) to His100, the formation of the b-turn (residues 100 to 103) initiates reorientation of the adjacent loop connection to a7 (event c). The carboxylate group of Glu147H (a8H ) forms hydrogen bonds to two water ligands of Mg2 (event d). Finally (event e), Arg104 forms a salt-bridge to Asp178H after a9H has closed the entrance. Hydrogen bonds and Mg2-coordination are indicated by broken lines.

444 binding site of Tc-chelated Mg2 as the initiation point for conformational rearrangements associated with induction. Event c Adjacent to this b-turn, the loop with residues 104 to 106 is reoriented to form a part of the hydrophobic pocket by methylene side-chains of Arg104 and Pro105 for the Tc-ring D. Event d After a rotation by $90 , the carboxylate group of Glu147H (a8H ) forms hydrogen bonds to Gly102N of the new b-turn and to two Mg2-coordinating water molecules. Event e The hydrophobic pocket is completed by residues Leu170H , Leu174H and Met177H of a9H , which closes the entrance of the binding tunnel like a sliding door and ®nally places the C-terminal Asp178H in an appropriate position to form a saltbridge to Arg104. Induction As mentioned above, binding of [Mg Tc] to TetR triggers the unwinding of the C-terminal turn of a6, which is in contact with the central part of a4. These two a-helices form angles of about 60 and 53 in 2TCT and TetR(BD), respectively. The positioning of a4 (residues 48 to 63) is determined by a hydrophobic contact region (Leu52, Ala56) to the C-terminal helical turn of a6 (Val99, Thr103), see Figure 7. This region was proposed to represent a pivot for a4, in a see-saw- and lever-like mechanism for induction (Hinrichs et al., 1994), which we can now analyse in more detail. The Mg2-induced transformation of the C-terminal turn of a6 into a b-turn produces free space at the contact surface to a4, which now moves to ®ll the void. Compared to 2TCT, the main-chain r.m.s. deviations of a4 increase from the C terminus in the direction of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain a1 to a3, see Figure 4(a). The position of the C terminus of a4 remains essentially unaltered with the pivoting of Tc-binding His64, and the adjustment of the DNA-binding domains for induction or operator recognition can be described as a hinge-like movement of a4. In the induced Tc-complexes, 2TRT and 2TCT, the distance between the recognition helices a3 and a3H is mainÊ tained at about 39 A and in the inducer-free TetR(BD) crystal structure their distance is Ê increased slightly by $1 A. In the operator/TetR complex, the recognition helices a3 and a3H of the HTH motifs have to insert into adjacent major Ê grooves in an antiparallel orientation at $34 A separation, assuming canonical B-DNA. The inducerfree TetR(BD) de®ned as the pre-induced state, has

The DNA-binding domain a1 to a3 and a4 are represented by tubes. Red arrows indicate induced structural movements. [Mg 7ClTc] (red, blue Mg2-sphere) triggers the transformation of the C-terminal turn of a6 into a b-turn (residues 100 to 103). The hydrogen bond of this induced b-turn (O100 . . . NH103) is formed at the expense of a hydrogen bond in a6 (O98 . . . NH102; broken lines). Helix a4 is in contact with the unwinding part of a6 and the resulting void is ®lled by a4 moving into the same direction. This movement is associated with a displacement of the DNAbinding domain a1 to a3 into a position where the homodimeric TetR no longer recognizes the operator DNA.

the DNA-binding domains suf®ciently mobile to allow docking to the operator DNA. In the crystal lattice, neighbouring molecules are arranged headto-head (Kisker et al., 1995) and it remains possible that intermolecular contacts play a role in preventing the recognition helices from moving towards each other. Another reason why the recognition helices are not in a position compatible with DNA binding could be the existence of equivalent charged regions on each DNA-binding domain, which would interact unfavourably in the absence of DNA. A chain of water molecules along a 4 links the inducer-binding site to the DNA-binding domain The N-terminal helical turn (residues 107 to 109) of a7 (107 to 121) of Tc-free TetR(BD) is distorted into a 310-helical conformation after inducer binding (2TCT, 2TRT). This is due to the formation of an extended water-mediated hydrogen bonding

445 The rigid core Non-inducible TetR mutants resulting from mutations at the dimer interface have suggested a role for the core helices a8 and a10, and their symmetry-related mates, in the mechanism of inducÈ tion (Muller et al., 1995). A shear motion of the two core subunits (each encompassing two of the four central helices) was proposed to increase the distance between the DNA-binding domains by Ê $5 A. This now appears unlikely, especially as the orientation of a8 and a10 with respect to their symmetry-related counterparts is observed to represent the most rigid part of known structures of TetR. We therefore conclude that the mobility of the DNA-binding domains, supported by rearrangements of helices a4 and a6 is suf®cient to ensure operator binding or release after Tc recognition. The reason for the above-mentioned group of mutants interfering with induction is presumably related to the reduced stability of the central core, which is required as a compact unit for Tc anchoring.

Figure 8. In the induced structure, the DNA-binding domains are tightly locked in a conformation unable to bind to the operator DNA. This rigidity is supported by an extended network of hydrogen bonds (broken lines) that stabilize the positions of a4 to a6 after induction. The network becomes possible only after the loop segment connecting a6 and a7 moves into position following [Mg 7ClTc]-recognition and induction, which starts closing the indicated ``water zipper'' with b-turn formation of residues His100 to Thr103. A zigzag-chain of water molecules (red spheres) forms on one side hydrogen bonds to carbonyl oxygen atoms (53, 56, 57, 60 and 64) of a4. On the opposite side, this water chain forms hydrogen bonds to the amide group of 7ClTc at ring A via water 7, peptide NH104 (water 2) and O104 (water 4). The side-chain of Gln109 has a central position in this network through Gln109 Ne, bridging the water molecules 5 and 6. Gln109 Oe forms hydrogen bonds to NH106 and water 9, which is in turn hydrogen bonded to a water ligand of Mg2 (not shown).

Materials and Methods
Mutagenesis, expression and purification Escherichia coli RB791 was used for cloning and overexpression (Brent & Ptashne, 1981). Isolation, manipulation and sequencing of DNA was performed according to Maniatis et al. (1982). For construction of pWH610(B/D)51-208 (Schnappinger et al., 1998), which was used for overexpression of TetR(BD), pWH853(B/D)51-208 was digested with XbaI and NcoI, and the tetR (BD) fragment was cloned into similarly digested pWH1950 (Ettner et al., 1996). The presence of tetR (BD) was veri®ed by sequencing the entire gene. Overproduction and puri®cation of TetR was performed as described for TetR(B) (Ettner et al., 1996). Crystallization and Data collection TetR(BD)-protein solution (10 ml of 10 mg/ml TetR(BD), 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) mixed with 5 ml of reservoir (0.8 M potassium phosphate buffer and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) were equilibrated to the reservoir buffer in a vapour diffusion assay (hanging drop) at 18 C. Crystals with a maximum size of 1.5 mm Â 1.5 mm Â 0.5 mm grew within two weeks. TetR(BD) crystals were found to be isomorphous to those of 2TRT and 2TCT, see Table 1. X-ray diffraction data of the TetR(BD) mutant were collected at 4 C with a single crystal on an MAR Research image plate detector, using synchrotron radiation at LURE, Paris-Orsay (beamline DW32). The dataset was processed with MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992) and other programs of the CCP4 (1994) suite. Statistics of the data collection are summarized in Table 1. Phase determination and refinement The present model was re®ned against all data to a Ê È maximum resolution of 2.4 A using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1996), with reference parameters for stereochemical restraints derived by Engh & Huber (1991). The free

network, which links the [Mg Tc]-binding site via the amide side-chain of Gln109 to a4, see Figure 8. Gln109 Oe forms hydrogen bonds both to the peptide backbone NH106 and, via a water molecule, to one aqua-ligand of the Mg2-coordination sphere. Gln109 Ne is part of a zigzag-chain with eight water molecules hydrogen bonded to peptide carbonyl oxygen atoms 53, 56, 57, 63 and 64 of a4. This hydrogen bonding network ®xes the [Mg Tc]-binding site to a4 carrying the N-terminal DNA-binding domain. In the inducer-free TetR, this water network is not observed, because several anchor points associated with [Mg Tc] are missing. The inducer-free structure is more open/loose with greater ¯exibility around the empty binding pocket.

R-value was used to monitor the quality of all re®neÈ ment and model building steps (Brunger, 1992). Relevant re®nement statistics are given in Table 1. The crystal structure of TetR(BD) was suf®ciently isomorphous to 2TRT and 2TCT for initial phasing. The polypetide chain of the 2TCT complex (excluding [Mg 7ClTc] and all water molecules) was used as a starting model for rigid body and simulated annealing re®nement using molecuÈ lar dynamics with a slow-cooling protocol (Brunger, 1996) from 2000 to 300 K and an overall B-factor of Ê 30.0 A2. Manual model building was supported by FRODO (Jones, 1978). Water molecules were identi®ed in difference electron density maps employing a threshold of three r.m.s. deviations above mean density in (Fo À Fc) maps, and 1 r.m.s. in (2Fo À Fc) maps. Water Ê molecules located at a distance of 2.0 to 4.5 A of potential hydrogen bond donors or acceptors were added to the existing model. They were rejected if their B-factors Ê exceeded 75 A2 during re®nement. The quality of the model was controlled by 2Fo À Fc simulating annealing È omit maps (Brunger, 1996), calculated in the vicinity of functionally important polypeptide segments, e.g. residues 100 to 104. Following model completion, bulk solvent correction was applied for ®nal re®nement of positional and thermal parameters. The loop segment of residues 152 to 165 in TetR(BD) was not included in the model, because the corresponding electron densities were not clearly interpretable. The Ramachandran plot showed main-chain torsion angles in the commonly expected regions. Only Leu204 lies in the ``generously

allowed'' region; this amino acid residue is part of the C-terminal loop and located in well-de®ned electron density. Docking The geometry of the [Mg Tc]-complex was optimized with the program SPARTAN (Hehre et al., 1993) and the semi-empirical PM3 method. The magnesium ion is octahedrally coordinated by the chelating ketoenolate group O-11/O-12 of the antibiotic, three water ligands and a fourth water molecule, replacing the His100 Ne2 coordination. Atomic charges of the [Mg Tc] complex were ®tted against the quantum chemically calculated electrostatic potential. Subsequently, we used the program EPOS written by our group to perform a ®nite-difference solution of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann-equation (Gilson et al., 1987) for a given charge distribution of the protein, based on the GROMOS force-®eld (van Gunsteren et al., 1996), and the quantum chemically calculated charges for the ligand. The electrostatic calcuÊ lation was done on a grid with 1.0 A spacing, a minimal Ê distance between protein surface and grid edges of 15 A, 0.1 molar ionic strength, and dielectric constants of 1.0 and 80.0 for the protein interior and the solvent area, respectively. The program EPOS was also used to obtain trajectories for the [Mg Tc] ligand within the previously calculated electrostatic potential of the repressor. These electrostatically ``guided walks'' started from positions at Ê least 15 A away from the protein, chosen from a spheri-

Tetracycline Trapping by Tet Repressor cal distribution of ligands around the target. New orientations for the ligand were generated by random translations and rotations, and accepted by minimizing the energy. The ®nal positions of all trajectories were weighted against each other according to a Boltzmann distribution, in order to describe statistically the ensemble of inducer positions on the TetR surface.
