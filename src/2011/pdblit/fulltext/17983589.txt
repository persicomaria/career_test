Abstract Aminopeptidase P (APPro) is a manganese-containing enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of the N-terminal residue of a polypeptide if the second residue is proline. Structures of APPro mutants with reduced or negligible activity have been determined in complex with the tripeptide substrate ValProLeu. In the complex of Glu383Ala APPro with ValProLeu one of the two metal sites is only partly occupied, indicating an essential role for Glu383 in metal binding in the presence of substrate. His361Ala APPro clearly possesses residual activity as the ValProLeu substrate has been cleaved in the crystals; difference electron density consistent with bound ProLeu dipeptide and a disordered Val amino acid is present at the active site. Contrary to previous suggestions, the His243Ala mutant is capable of binding substrate. The structure of the His243Ala APPro complex with ValProLeu shows that the peptide interacts with one of the active-site metal atoms via its terminal amino group. The implications of these complexes for the roles of the respective residues in APPro catalysis are discussed. Ó 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Aminopeptidase P (APPro1; EC 3.4.11.9) catalyses the removal of the N-terminal residue from a peptide or protein if the second residue is proline [1]. APPro is widely distributed; it has been identified as one of only 80 proteins that have been maintained in all organisms since the divergence of the universal common ancestor of the three domains of life (archaea, eubacteria and eukarya) [2]. Cellular APPro plays an important role in the recycling of proline-containing peptides [3]. Extracellular mammalian APPro is involved in the regulation of biologically active peptide hormones such bradykinin [4­6]. Additionally, Escherichia coli APPro is capable of degrading organo*

phosphate compounds [7] and the APPro from Lactococcus lactis has been implicated in reducing bitterness during the ripening of cheese [8]. APPro has been biochemically characterised from bacteria [1,9], archaea [10], nematodes [11], insects [12], plants [13] and mammals [4,14­17]. The enzyme is active at high pH (8­9) and requires the addition of metal ions (typically Mn2+) for optimal catalytic activity [1,18,19]. The only APPro crystal structure known is that from the bacterium E. coli [20­24], although the active site residues are strongly conserved across different species [23]. E. coli APPro is a tetramer in which each of the four subunits is comprised of two domains [20]. The C-terminal (catalytic) domain closely resembles the single catalytic domain of E. coli methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) [25]. In the native structure of APPro, the active site contains a dinuclear manganese centre bridged by a solvent molecule that is the putative nucleophile [21]. The two metal ions in the cluster are not structurally equivalent; one (MnA) is

five-coordinate with distorted square pyramidal coordination geometry, and the other (MnB) is six-coordinate with distorted octahedral geometry. Structures of APPro complexed with the product inhibitor ProLeu [20] or with the drug apstatin (N-(2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl-L-prolyl-L-prolyl-L-alaninamide) [24] have clearly defined the general features of substrate binding. Further, a complex of the apo enzyme, in which the active site Mn atoms were absent, with the substrate tripeptide ValProLeu suggested the nature of substrate binding, at least in the absence of the metal ions [21]. Attempts to crystallise a substrate complex of the holo enzyme have thus far been unsuccessful because the crystallised enzyme retains activity such that substrate soaked into crystals is turned over to yield enzyme­product complexes [21]. In the present work, we address the issue of substrate binding by studying the structures of complexes of ValProLeu with three APPro mutants, His243Ala, His361Ala and Glu383Ala, that have been characterised previously and shown to have very low or no measurable activity [23]. It has been observed that His243 interacts with the P01 (proline) residue of bound product, a hydrogen bond being present between the imidazole group of His243 and the carbonyl oxygen of the P01 residue [20,21]. While His243Ala APPro does not have measurable enzymatic activity, the structure of this mutant revealed an active site virtually indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme; the only difference being a slight shift in the position of a solvent atom (W2; Scheme 1). It was proposed that the reduced activity of His243Ala APPro arose from the inability of this mutant to stabilise substrate binding due to the loss of a required hydrogen bond from Ne2(His243) to the O(peptide) atom of the P01 residue of the substrate [21]. However, an alternate role for His243 had been proposed based on homology with MetAP [26]. In a complex of MetAP with the catalytic transition-state analogue Lmethionine phosphonate, Ne2(His79) [equivalent to Ne2(His243) of E. coli APPro] moves from its position in the native enzyme to donate a hydrogen bond to a phosphonate oxygen atom that is presumed to lie in the same position as the scissile N(peptide) atom in a substrate or true transition-state complex [26]. In this case Ne2(His79)

would be a recipient of the hydrogen bond donated by the N(peptide) atom of substrate. As has been noted previously [23], MetAP is active against substrates with a proline residue in the P01 position in which there is no proton on the N(peptide) atom to form this hydrogen bond. Mutation of His361 to alanine reduces the activity of APPro to <1% of the wild-type activity [23]. Similarly, mutation of the equivalent residue in MetAP, His178, to alanine results in a comparable loss of activity [27]. It has been proposed that this residue acts either to modulate the Lewis acidity of the metal atoms and/or stabilise the gem-diol reaction intermediate [20,21,27­29]. In wild-type APPro, a water molecule at the active site (W2; Scheme 1) forms hydrogen bonds with the Ne2 atom of His361 and with the solvent molecule that bridges the metal ions (W1, the putative nucleophile; Scheme 1). In the His361Ala mutant structure W2 is not seen, seemingly consistent with a role for His361 in modulating the Lewis acidity of the metal atoms via an active-site solvent network. However, in the complex of holo APPro with the inhibitor apstatin [24] and of apo APPro with the tripeptide substrate ValProLeu [21] the water molecule W2 is displaced and a direct hydrogen bond is formed between Ne2(His361) and the O(peptide) atom of the substrate P1 residue. If W2 is displaced when substrate binds to the holo enzyme then any effect on Lewis acidity by His361 acting through this water molecule will be lost. Instead, the direct hydrogen bond between His361 and the P1 O(peptide) atom observed in the structures of APPro in complexes with apstatin and ValProLeu supports a role for this residue in positioning the scissile peptide bond for nucleophilic attack and in stabilising the gem-diol intermediate [23]. Glu383 directly coordinates the Mn atom in the `A' site of the APPro active site and forms a strong hydrogen bond with the bridging solvent molecule (Scheme 1). Mutation of Glu383 to alanine reduces the activity of APPro by over two orders of magnitude, despite the presence of both Mn atoms at the active site of the mutant [23]. It was proposed that the lack of observable activity for Glu383Ala APPro may be caused by the removal of the base that deprotonates the bridging solvent nucleophile during catalysis, or by movement of this nucleophile to a position inappropriate for attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate in the absence of a stabilizing bond from Glu383 [23]. We have now solved and refined the structures of the His243Ala, His361Ala and Glu383Ala mutants of E. coli APPro complexed with the tripeptide substrate ValProLeu.
Materials and methods Purification, crystallisation, substrate-soaking and data collection
Mutant APPro was expressed and purified as described previously [23] and the ValProLeu tripeptide was synthesised as described previously [21]. Crystals of mutant APPro were grown at 4 °C by vapour diffusion in hanging drops containing 2 lL of precipitant solution (26­30% w/v PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5­8.8) and 2 lL of APPro ($10 mg mL-1).

fraction-quality crystals grew within 1 month. Crystals were soaked with substrate and cryoprotected concomitantly: crystals were transferred to a fresh drop containing 26­30% w/v PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 10% v/v 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 1 mM MnCl2, 5 mM Val-Pro-Leu tripeptide and incubated at 4 °C for 30 (His243Ala and Glu383Ala) or 60 (His361Ala) minutes immediately prior to cryocooling. All crystals were flash cryocooled in a stream of N2 gas (100 K) prior to data collection. Diffraction of a substrate-soaked His361Ala crystal was recorded at 100 K on a Mar345 imaging plate detector (Marresearch) using X-rays produced ° by a Rigaku RU200H rotating anode generator (Cu Ka, k = 1.5418 A), focused with Osmic mirrors (MSC Rigaku). Diffraction of substratesoaked His243Ala and Glu383Ala crystals was recorded at the Advanced ° Photon Source beamline 23-ID-D (k = 0.97934 A) at 100 K on a MARmosaic 300 detector (Mar USA). Diffraction data were indexed, integrated and scaled using MOSFLM [30] and SCALA [31] (His361Ala) or the HKL2000 processing suite [32] (His243Ala and Glu383Ala).

Structure solution and refinement
All structures were solved by isomorphous molecular replacement using the structure of wild-type Mn-loaded APPro (PDB ID 1WL9, [21]) stripped of all non-protein atoms (metals, solvent and hetero compounds) and alternate conformations. The starting model was refined as a rigid ° body using diffraction data to 3.0 A resolution with REFMAC5 [33]. Subsequent refinement involved iterative cycles of model building in COOT [34] followed by TLS [35] and restrained refinement in REFMAC5 using all available diffraction data. TLS motion was analysed and optimal TLS parameters were obtained with the assistance of the TLSMD server [36,37]. The occupancies of partially-occupied atoms in each structure were refined iteratively to produce minimum residual difference electron density and similar B-values to adjacent atoms. Analysis and validation of all structures were carried out using the MOLPROBITY server [38] and the validation tools present in COOT. Superpositions and calculations of rms difference were performed using the program SSM [39]. Peaks in anomalous electron-density difference maps were integrated with MAP° MAN [40] in 2 · 2 · 2 A3 cubes centred on the peak maximum. Molecular graphics were generated using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, CA).

refined locations of the two Mn atoms are assumed to be the weighted average of their positions in di-Mn, MnA only and MnB only species. Probably as a consequence of the metal site heterogeneity in this structure, the solvent molecule that bridges the two metal atoms in the native structure is disordered (Fig. 1(A) and (B)) and could not be modelled successfully. The electron density for the bridging solvent molecule probably represents a mixture of a bridging solvent coordinated to both metal atoms and a solvent bound to only one of the metal atoms when the other is absent. Like the metal atoms in the active site, the bound ValProLeu peptide is present at only 0.7 occupancy (Fig. 1(B)). The C-terminal ProLeu residues of the bound substrate are in an almost identical position to the equivalent residues in the complex of native APPro with the product ProLeu (Fig. 2(A)). The N-terminal amino group coordinates MnB and the O carbonyl atom of the first pep° tide bond makes a long contact (3.2 A) with MnA. The structure of His361Ala APPro in complex with ValProLeu In this structure the MnA and MnB sites are fully occupied. Difference electron density calculated prior to the addition of any entities other than the metal atoms and bridging solvent atom in the active site clearly indicated the presence of the cleavage products of ValProLeu hydrolysis (Fig. 1(C)). The C-terminal product ProLeu is bound in a similar fashion to a previously observed APPro­ProLeu complex (Fig. 3). While clear electron density was present for the proline residue and backbone of the leucine residue, the density for the leucinyl side chain was very poor, indicating disorder of this side chain. We ascribe additional electron density at the active site to the retention of the N-terminal product amino acid valine at the active site, although this amino acid does not have a single distinct binding location and could not be modelled. It is interesting to note that in many previous experiments where the wild-type enzyme was either soaked or co-crystallised with the tripeptide ValProLeu, ProLeu was clearly defined in the active site but no electron density ever indicated the presence of the liberated valine amino acid ([21] and unpublished observations). In the final refined model the distance between the bridging solvent atom and MnB ° (1.7 A) is shorter than the equivalent distance in the struc° ture of uncomplexed His361Ala APPro (2.0 A) [23]. This difference probably arises from errors in positioning the bridging solvent model due to the presence of the disordered Val residue at the active site rather than any significant change in the MnB­nucleophile interaction. The structure of Glu383Ala APPro in complex with ValProLeu In the refined structure of the Glu383Ala mutant the MnA and MnB sites have occupancies of 0.3 and 0.9, respectively. This is in contrast to the structure of

Results General description of the structures and refinement The crystals of the mutants all grew in the hexagonal space group P6422, the same as that for the original native crystals grown at high pH [20]. In this crystal form there is one subunit in the asymmetric unit and the functional tetramer is formed by the application of crystallographic 222 symmetry. Refinement of the structures resulted in relatively low resid° uals (0.14­0.15) for resolutions from 1.56 to 1.70 A (Table 1). All three mutants were clearly identified by the absence of electron-density for the side chains beyond the Cb atoms. Despite the presence of excess Mn in all soaking experiments, the two metal positions in the active site are not occupied to the same extent in the different mutants. The position and nature of the bound peptide is also different despite equivalent soaking procedures with excess ValProLeu. The structure of His243Ala APPro in complex with ValProLeu In the refined model of the His243Ala mutant the MnA and MnB sites are 0.8 and 0.7 occupied, respectively. The

uncomplexed Glu383Ala APPro solved previously, where both metal atoms were present at full occupancy [23]. The atom in the position of MnA could be positively identified as a partially-occupied manganese atom, rather than a water molecule or sodium ion, by exploiting the difference in anomalous scattering of these elements (f00 : Mn 2.8 eÀ, S ° 0.6 eÀ, O 0.2 eÀ, and Na 0.1 eÀ at k = 1.54 A [41]). The integrated height of the peak co-localised with MnA in an anomalous electron-density difference map was 202, significantly greater than the largest peak co-localised with a sulphur atom (118; Sc of Cys202) but lower than the peak colocalised with MnB (783) due to the partial occupancy of ° MnA. MnA is moved about 0.4 A towards Asp271 relative

to its position in the native structure and two water molecules are in the space vacated by the lost carboxylate group of the mutated residue (Fig. 1(D)). The coordination of MnB by Asp260 is more asymmetric, the position of the ° metal atom having shifted by 0.4 A relative to its position in the wild-type structure. In the wild-type structure the distances from MnB to Od1(Asp260) and Od2(Asp260) are ° ° 2.2 and 2.3 A, respectively, compared with 2.1 and 2.7 A, respectively, in the Glu383Ala­ValProLeu complex. The bound ValProLeu tripeptide in the mutant complex structure superposes very closely on its position in the structure of apo APPro in complex with ValProLeu (Fig. 4). The ValProLeu is present at full occupancy. The N(amino)

conformation of the Val residue could not be modelled reliably. The O(peptide) atom of the peptide group between the Val and Pro residues of the peptide forms a hydrogen bond with the Ne2 atom of His361 as it does in the apo APPro complex with ValProLeu. This same carbonyl oxy° gen atom makes a long contact (2.8 A) to MnA when this metal atom is present. The binding of the peptide is further stabilised by a hydrogen bond from the carbonyl oxygen atom of the peptide group between the Pro and Leu residues of the tripeptide and the Ne2 atom of His243. Discussion The structures of three mutant forms of E. coli APPro, His243Ala, His361Ala and Glu383Ala, in complex with the substrate ValProLeu (or products derived from the cleavage of that substrate) have been determined to high resolution. The nature of substrate binding at the active site of each mutant differs, as does the contents of the metal site, providing us with significant insight into the roles the mutated residues in the catalytic mechanism. His243Ala binds the peptide substrate, ValProLeu, in an apparently productive conformation. The N(amino) group binds directly to MnB, displacing a solvent molecule (W3) observed in the wild-type structure in an equivalent posi-

tion (Fig. 1). The solvent atom (W2) weakly associated with MnA that forms hydrogen bonds to the bridging solvent molecule (W1) and to His361 in the wild-type and uncomplexed His243Ala mutant structures is also displaced by ValProLeu, the O(peptide) atom of the scissile ° peptide bond of the bound peptide being located 0.4 A from the position of the displaced water in the uncomplexed His243Ala structure. Displacement of ordered water from the active site by substrate is presumably an entropic contributor to the energy of substrate binding. The C-terminal ProLeu of the bound substrate is in an very similar position to that seen in the complex of native APPro with ProLeu (Fig. 2(A)); the maximum difference in any equiv° alent atom position is 0.7 A. If the structures of the ValProLeu complex of His243Ala APPro and of native APPro in complex with the inhibitor apstatin are superposed, the ° N(amino) groups are 0.7 A apart (Fig. 2(B)). Apstatin has a 1,2-substituted b-aminoacyl N-terminal residue and the additional hydroxyl group displaces the solvent molecule that is seen bridging the metal atoms in the native structure. Thus while apstatin binds much in the same manner as a substrate it displaces the putative nucleophile and thereby becomes an effective inhibitor. The bridging solvent nucleophile is still clearly present at the active site of the His243Ala APPro in complex with ValProLeu,

The Pro residue of the bound ProLeu dipeptide is very well resolved in 2Fo À Fc difference electron density calculated at the end of refinement (blue, 1.2r). The side chain of the bound Leu residue is not well resolved, presumably due to the absence of a stabilizing hydrophobic interaction with the side chain of His361. Residual Fo À Fc difference electron density, calculated for the structure of His361Ala APPro in complex with ProLeu at the end of refinement, shown in green (3r), indicates the likely position of the cleaved valine.

although its location could not be accurately modelled due to partial occupancy of the metal sites (Fig. 1(B)). The reasons for the low to negligible activity of the His243Ala mutant are therefore less clear. It was previously suggested that the essential role of His243 and, by implication, equivalent conserved residues in related enzymes, is the stabilization of substrate binding by donation of a hydrogen bond

from Ne2(His243) to the O(peptide) atom of the P01 residue of the substrate, as seen in the apstatin and ProLeu complexes [23]. Since we have isolated a substrate complex of the His243Ala mutant with significant occupancy of ValProLeu in the active site, bound in a manner consistent with our model for catalysis, and where there is no evidence for a hydrolysis product, formation of the

Ne2(His243)­O(peptide) hydrogen bond clearly cannot be essential for binding or for the correct positioning of substrate in the active site. We must therefore conclude that His243 plays an important, but as-yet undetermined, role in the catalytic mechanism of APPro and related enzymes. Despite its low activity (<1% of wild type, [23]), the structure of His361Ala APPro from crystals soaked for 60 min at 4 °C in the presence of the tripeptide substrate ValProLeu clearly shows the presence of product, ProLeu, at the active site. Cleavage of the tripeptide substrate ValProLeu by crystallised APPro, or by the enzyme in solution under conditions designed to mimic those of cryoprotected crystals, has been observed previously [21]. There is some evidence of a weakly bound, disordered valine at the active site (Figs. 1(C) and 3(A)). Refinement of intact ValProLeu at the active site of His361Ala APPro in conformations similar to that observed in the His243Ala or Glu383Ala complexes led to significant negative electron density over the Val C(carbonyl) and O(carbonyl) atoms, and over the Val­Pro peptide bond (not shown). The absence of electron density for the Val C(carbonyl) atom, the position of which is tightly constrained by the cyclic nature of the proline side chain, confirms cleavage of the ValProLeu tripeptide rather than just disorder of the Val residue (Fig. 3(A)). Both the ProLeu and the two metal sites are fully occupied. The ProLeu is in the same position as in the complex of native APPro with ProLeu (Fig. 3(B)) [20]. The leucinyl side chain of the bound ProLeu is poorly ordered, presumably due to a loss of hydrophobic stacking interactions between the imidazole ring of His361 and the aliphatic side chain of the leucine (Fig. 3(A)). His361 was previously assigned the catalytic functions of modulating the Lewis acidity of the active site metal atoms and/or of stabilising of the gem-diol intermediate [20,27­29], the former being less likely due to ejection of the solvent atoms that would mediate the Lewis-acid modulation upon substrate binding [23]. The activity observed for His361Ala obviously indicates that its role in stabilisation of the gem-diol transition state is not absolutely required for catalysis. The presence of a disordered valine amino acid at the active site suggests that the reduced activity of His361Ala may arise due to an inability of the mutant to eject the product from the active site. Less efficient ejection of product would decrease the apparent substrate affinity of the mutant (increase Km), while the turnover rate (kcat) would remain unchanged. Kinetic analysis of the equivalent MetAP mutant, His178Ala, shows that this is not the case: His178Ala MetAP displays a reduced turnover rate but the substrate affinity is unchanged [27]. Similarly, an essential role for the side chain of His361 in forming hydrophobic interactions with side chain of the substrate P02 residue may be discounted, since His178Ala and wild-type MetAP have identical affinity for the substrate MetGlyMetMet [27]. We therefore conclude that the reduced activity of His361Ala APPro (and of His178Ala MetAP) is due to

less efficient catalysis caused by a lack of stabilisation of the transition state, rather than reduced affinity for substrate or inhibition by the N-terminal amino acid product. In the structure of wild-type APPro, Glu383 coordinates directly to MnA and forms a hydrogen bond with W1, the putative nucleophile. The structure of Glu383Ala APPro determined previously in the absence of substrate showed the location of the metal atoms to be equivalent in the mutant and native enzymes, but the solvent structure at the active site was significant re-arranged [23]. It is therefore interesting to observe that, in the presence of substrate, a significant population of molecules in the crystal lack MnA (occupancy 0.3). The terminal N(amino) group of the bound ValProLeu substrate bridges the two metal atoms, making equal length bonds to each (Fig. 1(D)). The peptide site is fully occupied in the crystal and the electron density indicates that the first two residues are very well ordered. Thus, the substrate would appear to bind in the same location regardless whether MnA is present or ° not. The N(amino) atom of the bound peptide is 1.7 A from its position in the His243Ala complex, closer to the position of the equivalent atom in the ValProLeu complex of apo APPro (Fig. 4) [21]. The position of the substrate N(amino) group is incompatible with the presence of the solvent molecule that bridges the metal atoms in the native structure. The displacement of the putative nucleophile, presumable due to the dual effects of the absence of MnA from the active site and the absence of a stabilising hydrogen bond with Glu383, indicates that the mode of substrate binding seen in the Glu383Ala complex would not be productive and thus explains the inactivity of the mutant. In summary, the structures of APPro mutants in complex with a substrate tripeptide have provided firm evidence for the binding mode of substrate to the holo enzyme. They have shown that His243 has a role in catalysis beyond binding substrate, that the enzyme is catalytically competent in the absence of His361, and that the inactivity of Glu383Ala APPro arises from an inability to correctly bind the catalytic metal atoms and stabilise the solvent nucleophile, regardless of any role for Glu383 as a general base in catalysis.
