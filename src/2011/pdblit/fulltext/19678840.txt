Glutamate carboxypeptidase III (GCPIII) is a metalloenzyme that belongs to the transferrin receptor / glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII; EC 3.4.17.21) superfamily. GCPIII has been studied mainly because of its evolutionary relationship to GCPII, an enzyme involved in a variety of neuropathologies and malignancies, such as glutamatergic neurotoxicity and prostate cancer. Given the potential functional and pharmacological overlap between GCPIII and GCPII, studies addressing the structural and physiological properties of GCPIII are crucial for obtaining a deeper understanding of the GCPII / GCPIII system. In the present study, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the human GCPIII ectodomain in a `pseudo-unliganded' state and in a complex with: (a) l-glutamate (a product of hydrolysis); (b) a phosphapeptide transition state mimetic, namely (2S,3¢S)-{[(3¢-amino-3¢-carboxy-propyl)-hydroxyphosphinoyl]methyl}-pentanedioic acid; and (c) quisqualic acid, a glutamate biostere. Our data reveal the overall fold and quaternary arrangement of the GCPIII molecule, define the architecture of the GCPIII substrate-binding cavity, and offer an experimental evidence for the presence of Zn2+ ions in the bimetallic active site. Furthermore, the structures allow us to detail interactions between the enzyme and its ligands and to characterize the functional flexibility of GCPIII, which is essential for substrate recognition. A comparison of these GCPIII structures with the equivalent GCPII complexes reveals differences in the organization of specificity pockets, in surface charge distribution, and in the occupancy of the co-catalytic zinc sites. The data presented here provide information that should prove to be essential for the structurallyaided design of GCPIII-specific inhibitors and might comprise guidelines for future comparative GCPII / GCPIII studies.

Structure of human GCPIII

Introduction
Glutamate carboxypeptidase III (GCPIII), a membrane-bound metalloenzyme, belongs to the MEROPS M28 peptidase family (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/), which encompasses a variety of proteins with considerable functional diversity, including peptidases (e.g. aminopeptidases, GCPII, GCPIII and plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase), receptor proteins [transferrin receptors (TfRs)], acyltransferases (glutaminyl cyclases), signaling molecules (nicalin), as well as proteins with as yet unknown functions [1,2]. Currently, the physiological role and tissue distribution of GCPIII are not known in detail. GCPIII mRNA expression has been observed in a variety of human and mouse tissues, with the strongest signals being detected in the testis, ovary, spleen and discrete brain areas [3,4]. Because of the lack of GCPIII-specific antibodies, the expression pattern of GCPIII at the protein level remains unknown. By contrast to the relative lack of experimental data for GCPIII, there are numerous reports regarding its closest homolog, GCPII (EC 3.4.17.21). GCPII, also known as NAALADase or prostate specific membrane antigen [5,6], is a membrane-bound metallopeptidase that is expressed in numerous human tissues, including the nervous system, small intestine and prostate [7­9]. By virtue of its involvement in glutamatergic neurotransmission [10], inhibition of the GCPII enzymatic activity has been shown to be neuroprotective in multiple preclinical models of various pathophysiological conditions [11]. Furthermore, even though the physiological function of the enzyme in the prostate is poorly understood, up-regulation of GCPII expression in prostate carcinoma makes it a target for prostate cancer imaging and therapy [12­17]. In addition to its role in peptide hydrolysis, GCPII has been found to affect the cell cycle [18] and to modulate integrin signaling [19]. Additionally, it might function as a receptor for as yet unidentified ligand(s) [20]. Taking into account the non-enzymatic functions attributable to GCPII, it may be considered as a representative of a growing family of `moonlighting' enzymes [21,22]. The physiological significance of GCPIII has been addressed only indirectly using knockout mouse models deficient in the gene encoding GCPII, which shares 67% identity with GCPIII at the amino acid level [23,24]. Whereas Tsai et al. [24] found GCPII to be crucial for the survival of mouse embryos, the results obtained by Bacich et al. [23] suggest that GCPIII can compensate for the missing GCPII protein (at least in part), including hydrolysis of N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), the natural dipeptidic substrate, in mouse brain [23]. In a study using a recombinant protein expressed in insect cells, we confirmed that GCPIII is capable of hydrolyzing NAAG in vitro, and we provided a direct comparison of the biochemical and pharmacological profiles of GCPII and GCPIII. Although we observed differences in pH and salt concentration dependence and noted that the enzymes have distinct substrate specificities, their inhibitory profiles were quite similar [25]. X-ray crystallographic studies revealed structural similarity between GCPII and the TfR [26,27]. The GCPII ectodomain consists of three distinct domains, namely protease, apical and dimerization (or helical), and all three domains are involved in substrate binding [27­29]. Substrate recognition by GCPII is associated with an induced-fit repositioning of the flexible loop around Lys699 (the `glutarate sensor'). The conformation of the `glutarate sensor' depends on occupancy of the S1¢ specificity pocket by glutamate or glutamatelike residues [27,30]. The binuclear active site of GCPII harbors two Zn2+ ions that are bridged near-symmetrically by a hydroxide anion [31], with the distance between the zinc ions varying depending on the presence and characteristics of an active site ligand [27,30]. The S1 pocket of GCPII is defined primarily by the side chains of three closely spaced Arg residues (534, 536 and 463). Whereas the position of the Arg534 side chain is virtually constant in all reported GCPII structures, the side chains of Arg536 and Arg463 accommodate variable conformations [29]. The flexibility of the S1 arginines is considered to regulate GCPII affinity towards different inhibitors and modulate GCPII substrate specificity [29,30,32]. The substrate-binding pocket of GCPII is shielded from the external space by the `entrance lid', a flexible segment comprising residues Trp541-Gly548. The `entrance lid' is hinged by Asn540 / Trp541 and Gly548 at its N- and C-terminus, respectively, and the transition between open and closed conformations appears to depend on the presence of a ligand molecule in the substrate-binding pocket [29]. Even though GCPIII is still not well-characterized and its particular physiological roles remain elusive, a detailed understanding of the structural properties of this protein is very important. As noted above, GCPII, the closest homolog of GCPIII, is currently a target of intensive drug development for the treatment of prostate cancer, amongst other areas [33]. Because of their extensive similarity, GCPII and GCPIII display a range of overlapping activities in vitro, yet even the presently available data indicate subtle differences

between the substrate preferences or inhibitor susceptibilities of both enzymes. The rational development of potent agents that would inhibit their glutamate carboxypeptidase activity has to account for the properties of both GCPII and GCPIII. Thus, structural data for the latter enzyme and its complexes with various ligands should prove immediately useful, even though detailed biological and physiological data might become available only later. In the present study, we report a comprehensive structural analysis of several functional complexes of recombinant human GCPIII (rhGCPIII), solved and ° refined at resolutions in the range 1.29­1.56 A. The structures presented include complexes of GCPIII and (a) (2S,3¢S)-{[(3¢-amino-3¢-carboxy-propyl)-hydroxy phosphinoyl]methyl}-pentanedioic acid (EPE), a phosphapeptide transition state analog of glutamyl-glutamate (rhGCPIII / EPE); (b) l-glutamate, a product of NAAG hydrolysis (rhGCPIII / Glu); and (c) 2-amino-3(3,5-dioxo[1,2,4]oxadiazolidin-2-yl)propionic acid (quisqualic acid; QA), a glutamate-like inhibitor of GCPIII (rhGCPIII / QA; Table 1). The fourth structure is referred to here as a `pseudo-unliganded' GCPIII because no ligands were added to the protein prior to crystallization. However, we found that molecules of l-glutamic acid (binding as in rhGCPIII / Glu) and Mops occupy the substrate-binding cavity of `pseudo-

unliganded' rhGCPIII. Crystal structures of analogous complexes have been reported recently for GCPII, allowing direct comparison between the two enzymes [27­29].

Results
Overall structure, dimerization interface and N-glycosylation sites The rhGCPIII polypeptide chain folds into three structural domains, which are analogous to the three domains of GCPII [27]: a protease domain (amino acids 46­106 and 342­580), an apical domain (amino acids 107­341) and a helical domain (amino acids 581­ 740). The overall structures of both proteins are quite similar, with rmsd values between the equivalent Ca° atoms of GCPIII and GCPII in the range 0.6­1.0 A. The fold of the protease domain resembles a typical M28 peptidase, with a central motif consisting of seven b-strands flanked by eleven a-helices. The apical domain (or the protease associated domain) is inserted into the protease domain and features a (3 + 4)stranded b-sandwich flanked by four a-helices. The principal motif of the helical domain (or transferrinlike dimerization domain) is a four a-helix bundle (Fig. 1).

Structure of human GCPIII

In the crystal, one monomer of GCPIII is present in the asymmetric unit, with a dimer formed by crystallographic symmetry. The relevance of the dimer can be derived by comparison with the related GCPII and TfR as well as by analysis of the crystallographic contacts within GCPIII crystals. The total surface area for ° the interface buried upon dimerization is 2390 A2, and the putative dimerization interface mostly involves interactions between residues of the helical domain of one monomer and residues of the protease and apical domains of the second monomer (Fig. 1B). The conserved calcium-binding residues near the putative monomer­monomer interface likely contribute to GCPIII folding and dimerization by (a) stabilizing the loop Tyr262-Phe269, which participates in dimerization contacts, and (b) allowing proper positioning of the protease and apical domains via simultaneous engagement of residues adjacent to Ca2+, as described for GCPII [27]. Predictions suggest seven potential N-glycosylation sites per GCPIII molecule. The interpretable electron density peaks were observed for four of these sites (Asn111, Asn185, Asn449 and Asn628) and, for each of them, one or two N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) molecules were modeled (Fig. 1B,C). Overall, GCPIII molecule is thus less heavily N-glycosylated than GCPII, with seven out of ten potential glycosylations being observed in the structures solved [28,29]. Moreover, no electron density peaks were found for the mannose units of the N-linked oligosaccharides, probably as a result of the increased flexibility of the more distal carbohydrate parts. Similar to previously reported findings for GCPII [27], N-glycosylation of Asn628 appears to contribute to the stabilization of GCPIII dimers through interactions between Asn628-NAG2 of one monomer and the side chain of Glu266 of the apical domain of the second monomer. The binuclear metal center Electron density maps reveal the presence of two metal ions in the active site of GCPIII. Because of the high level of homology between GCPIII and GCPII, it is reasonable to assume that both metal sites are occupied by Zn2+ ions. However, the identity of the metal ions became questionable even during the early stages of structural refinement, giving way to at least two possibilities: partial occupancy of Zn2+ sites or, alternatively, the presence of different (most likely lighter) metal ions such as Mn2+ or Co2+. To elucidate this ambiguity, we performed X-ray fluorescence scan analysis of the rhGCPIII / EPE complex (data not shown). Furthermore, we calculated the anomalous electron

density maps of the rhGCPIII / QA complex from the X-ray data collected at an energy corresponding to the Zn2+ absorption edge (Fig. 2A). The combined results from both experiments unequivocally demonstrate that the bimetallic active site of GCPIII is indeed occupied by Zn2+ ions and that the occupancy of at least one Zn2+ ion is only partial. In subsequent refinement steps, the strong difference peaks observed in the active site were modeled as Zn2+ ions, and their approximate occupancies were determined (by careful analysis of the B-factors of metal ions and surrounding residues, as well as difference electron density peaks) to be in the range 0.80­ 0.95 and 0.45­0.80 for Zn1 and Zn2, respectively. Both the topology and identity of the Zn2+ coordination sphere in GCPIII are almost identical to those observed for GCPII [27]. In GCPIII, the Zn1 cation is ° coordinated by Asp377 (Od1; 2.0 A; where values in parentheses describe the ranges of coordination distances observed for the four GCPIII structures), ° His543 (Ne2; 2.0­2.1 A) and Glu415 (Oe1 and Oe2; ° and 1.9­2.3 A, respectively). The co-catalytic ° 2.4­2.5 A ° ion, Zn2, is coordinated by Asp377 (Od2; 2.0 A), ° ) and Asp443 (Od1 and Od2; His367 (Ne2; 2.0­2.2 A ° ° 2.0­2.3 A and 2.3­2.6 A, respectively). The coordination sphere of the active site Zn2+ ions is complemented by a bridging hydroxide anion (or a water molecule) placed somewhat asymmetrically in between ° the two metal ions (Zn1...O...Zn2, 2.0­2.3 A and 2.1­ ° , respectively; Fig. 2B). Moreover, a second water 2.4 A molecule contributes to the Zn2 coordination (1.9­ ° 2.2 A) in all of the GCPIII structures that were solved (Fig. 2B). It should be noted that the distance between the active site Zn2+ ions varies depending on the type of ligand present in the substrate-binding cavity. In the `pseudo-unliganded' structure and in the rhGCPIII / Glu complex (the reaction product), the Zn1...Zn2 dis° tance is 3.7 A. However, when a moiety mimicking the transition state of the reaction (such as the phosphinate group of EPE or the sulfate moiety of Mops) ° coordinates zinc ions, the distance increases to 3.9 A, with a concomitant subtle reorganization of the active site architecture. Such variability is considered to be important during the catalytic cycle of binuclear hydrolases and has been observed previously in reported GCPII structures [27,34]. Because the occupancy of the Zn2 site in the rhGCPIII / Glu complex is 0.7, it was possible to build two alternative models of the active site residues and the S1 pocket. The side chain of Asp443, which coordinates the Zn2 ion in a monodentate / bidentate mode, is rotated by approximately 110° towards the position

of the S1-bound chloride anion and `pushes' the Cl) out of the bottom of the S1 pocket (the occupancy of the Cl) in this structure is 0.7). The alternate conformation of the Asp443 side chain (D443b with an occupancy of 0.3) is stabilized by interactions with the side chains of Arg524, Asn441 and Arg526 (Fig. 2C). It is plausible that the observed flexibility of Asp443, which is not found in any of the GCPII structures [27­30,32], is linked to the variations in amino acids surrounding the GCPIII active site, in particular to the presence of Ser509 in place of Asn519 in GCPII. Given the apparent steric freedom of Ser509, as revealed by the existence of two alternate conformations of its side chain, stabilization of the Asp443 position as a result of a
A

hydrogen bond to the Ser509 hydroxyl group might be weakened. Decreased stabilization of this hydrogen bond could result in loosened coordination of Zn2 and a propensity for Asp443 to adopt a stable alternate conformation when the Zn2 ion is absent (Fig. 2B,C). The S1 pocket and the `entrance lid' Out of the four GCPIII structures reported in the present study, only the rhGCPIII / EPE complex features the S1 specificity pocket occupied by the P1 moiety of the inhibitor.

chains of Arg526, Arg524 and Arg453 forming an `arginine patch' that is implicated in the preference of GCPIII for negatively-charged P1 residues [25]. This cluster of positively-charged residues is stabilized by the presence of a chloride anion that is coordinated in a distorted octahedral manner by the Arg524, Arg570 and Asn441 side chains; an Asp443 main chain amide; one or two water molecules; and, in the rhGCPIII / QA complex, the side chain of Arg526. A comparison of the four GCPIII structures reveals high conformational variability in the S1 site (Fig. 3B), including multiple conformations of the S1 arginines, as well as changes in the immediate surroundings of the chloride anion. By contrast to the GCPII S1 site architecture, multiple conformations are observed for the side chains of Glu447 and Arg524 of GCPIII and, compared to GCPII, Arg453 and Arg526, also exhibit increased conformational flexibility. The structural variability of the S1 site in GCPIII significantly affects the charge distribution on the surface of the active site pocket compared to GCPII (Fig. 3A). The enzyme­inhibitor interactions in the S1 pocket of the rhGCPIII / EPE complex are represented by four water-mediated contacts and, most importantly, direct interactions between the P1 carboxylic group of the ° inhibitor and guanidinium moieties of Arg524 (3.2 A ° for conformation B) for conformation A and 3.0 A ° ° and Arg526 (3.0 A and 3.3 A; Fig. 3C). In GCPII, the P1 carboxylic group is additionally hydrogen bonded to Asn519 but, in GCPIII, this interaction is absent as a result of the Asn519 to Ser509 change. The high B-factors of the P1 part of the inhibitor, as well as the adjacent S1 residues of GCPIII (compared to the lower B-factors observed for the P1¢ fragment and the S1¢ pocket), suggest that the enzyme­inhibitor interactions in the S1 pocket are somewhat weaker than in the S1¢ pocket and probably vary with slight modifications of the P1 moieties. These findings mirror the observations made previously for GCPII [29]. Adjacent to the S1 pocket, a flexible loop spanning residues Trp541 to Gly548 (`entrance lid') was observed to adopt either an `open' or `closed' conformation in GCPII complexes [29]. Stabilization of the `closed' conformation is likely to be associated with the occupancy of the S1 pocket by a ligand and the `open­close' transition exploits the hinges on the two sides of the lid made up of Asn540 / Trp541 and Gly548 (GCPII numbering). In the GCPIII complexes described here, the `entrance lid' is invariably in the `open' conformation, even though the active site is always occupied by a ligand molecule, at least partially (Fig. 4). One of the reasons for the apparent preference of the lid to adopt the `open' conformation in

Fig. 4. Comparison of the `entrance lid' conformations in GCPIII and GCPII. The GCPII and GCPIII complexes with EPE (PDB codes 3BI0 and 3FED, respectively) were superposed based on equivalent Ca atoms. The Ca traces for both proteins are colored gray and the `entrance lids' are colored red (amino acids Asn530­Ser538) and blue (amino acids Asn540­Gly548) for GCPIII and GCPII, respectively. Note that, in GCPII, the `entrance lid' accommodates a `closed' conformation upon EPE binding, but such a change is not observed in GCPIII, in which the `entrance lid' is always found in `open' conformation. This difference is likely a result of the replacement of Gly548 (GCPII) by the less flexible Ser538 (GCPIII). The orange spheres represent zinc ions.

GCPIII might be a result of the Gly548 at the C-terminus of the lid in GCPII being replaced by Ser538 in GCPIII, thus decreasing the flexibility of this hinge. Out of the GCPII orthologues identified, the Gly548 is only present in human, chimp and gorilla, whereas the position is occupied by a serine residue (as observed in GCPIII) in other species, such as in orangutan and macaque. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the Ramachandran angles for the Gly548 residue of GCPII are highly unfavorable for any l-amino acid. The S1¢ pocket and the `glutarate sensor' The S1¢ pocket, the pharmacophore pocket of GCPIII, is shaped by residues Phe199, Arg200, Asn247, Glu414, Gly417, Leu418, Gly508, Tyr542, Lys689 and Tyr690. The specificity of GCPIII towards the P1¢ glutamate (or glutamate-like moieties) is determined by a combination of ionic and polar interactions (Fig. 5). In all complexes, the C-terminal a-carboxylate is recognized by Arg200 through an ion pair interaction ° ° (2.8­2.9 A for the Ng1 atom and 3.2­3.5 A for the Ng2 atom of the guanidinium group; where values in parentheses describe the ranges of coordination dis4455

The side chain c-carboxylate group of the substrate forms a strong salt bridge with ° Lys689 (2.4­2.9 A), and further interacts with the side ° chain amide of Asn247 (2.7­2.9 A). In the case of the S1¢-bound quisqualate, in which the c-carboxylate of glutamate is replaced by the 1,2,4-oxadiazolidine ring, two additional polar interactions involve hydrogen bonds between the exocyclic oxygen and the Gly508 ° main chain amide (2.8 A) and the Ser507 hydroxyl ° ). These two added polar contacts, group (3.1 A together with more extensive nonpolar interactions involving Phe199 and Leu418, are likely to be responsible for the approximately three orders of magnitude higher affinity compared to glutamate (Table 1). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the architecture of the S1¢ site is mostly unchanged upon QA binding. These findings contrast with the adjustments necessary to accommodate QA in the S1¢ pocket of GCPII [28] and suggest that the pharmacophore pocket of GCPIII might be better-optimized for the binding of glutamate biosteres, as reflected by the four-fold higher affinity of QA for GCPIII versus GCPII (Table 1). The free amino group in both the rhGCPIII / Glu and rhGCPIII / QA complexes interacts with the ° Gly508 main chain carbonyl (2.9 A), c-carboxylate of ° ° Glu414 (2.6­2.7 A and 3.3­3.5 A), the active site° bound hydroxide anion / water molecule (2.8­3.0 A) and a water molecule that is in turn hydrogen bonded to the OH group of Tyr542. The phosphinate group of EPE (and the sulfate group of Mops), which mimics

the tetrahedral transition state of the reaction [31], coordinates the active site Zn2+ ions with interatomic ° ° distances of 1.9 A (O1...Zn1) and 2.1 A (O2...Zn2). Additionally, a network of hydrogen bonding interactions in the vicinity of the bimetallic active site involves the phosphinate / sulfate (in the rhGCPIII / EPE and rhGCPIII / `pseudo-unliganded' structures, respectively) moiety and the side chains of Glu414, Asp443, His367, Asp377, His543 and Tyr542. The GCPIII flexible `glutarate sensor' encompasses amino acids Ile681 to Ser694 and forms the bottom of the S1¢ pocket. As a result of (at least partial) occupancy of the S1¢ pocket by the glutamate or glutamate-like moiety, this segment adopts a closed conformation in all the GCPIII structures presented. However, in the rhGCPIII / `pseudo-unliganded' structure, the closed conformation is modeled at only 0.4 occupancy, which corresponds to the occupancy of the S1¢-bound glutamate. In the remaining instances, the fragment could not be modeled because of disorder that was attributable to a multitude of open conformations. Interestingly, the apparent withdrawal (i.e. opening) of the `glutarate sensor' from the S1¢ pocket is associated with a relocation of the adjacent a-helix ° (residues Asn168-Ile190) of approximately 2.5 A (Fig. S1).

Discussion
In the present study, we report four high resolution structures of complexes of the extracellular part of human GCPIII and small molecule ligands. The overall fold of GCPIII is virtually invariant in all four

structures, with the rmsd between the corresponding ° Ca atoms reaching a maximum of 0.5 A (for the rhGCPIII / QA and rhGCPIII / `pseudo-unliganded' complexes). The majority of the protein residues, as well as the active site-bound ligands (with the notable exception of l-Glu and Mops partially occupying the active site in the rhGCPIII / `pseudo-unliganded' structure), are well defined in the electron density peaks (Fig. S2). The first ten N-terminal residues of the GCPIII ectodomain and a short fragment around Tyr133 (one to four residues) are missing from the structure. The nature of Asp327 (part of a loop on the surface of the apical domain), which is flanked by two serine residues in GCPIII, is also intriguing. Whereas the electron density of both serines is of excellent quality, the density for Asp327 is totally absent (Fig. S3). It may be of interest that this Ser-Asp-Ser motif is conserved in the GCPIII orthologs in the great apes (orangutan, chimp and gorilla), whereas it is variable in the remaining species studied (such as macaque, mouse and rat). Ramachandran analysis of the final models classifies all residues but two, Lys197 and Asn168 (in the GCPIII / `pseudo-unliganded' complex only), as having either favorable or allowed conformations. Despite falling into the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, all atoms of Lys197 and Asn168 have a well defined electron density. It is interesting to note that unfavorable backbone angles were also observed for Lys207 in GCPII, which is equivalent to Lys197 of GCPIII [27,28]. Concurrent analysis of the GCPIII structures presented here and the corresponding complexes of human GCPII reported previously [27­29] allows for a direct comparison between the two enzymes and helps to define features associated with similarities / differences in their physiological and biochemical properties. The high degree of structural similarity between human GCPII and GCPIII is apparent from the equivalent domain organization and comparable topology (Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, a few differences between both enzymes exist, including the surface distribution of electrostatic potentials, which reflects the distinct theoretical pI values of 6.4 and 8.1 for GCPII and GCPIII, respectively (Fig. S4). Based on structural homology with the receptor protein TfR [26], it is reasonable to suggest that the variability of the GCPIII / GCPII surfaces could be a major determinant in many physiological processes, such as interactions with hypothetical protein partners / ligands. Several common motifs have been identified in both GCPIII and GCPII, including the `glutarate sensor' and the Pro-rich region [27]. Both GCPII and GCPIII display an induced-fit movement of the `glutarate

sensor' upon binding of a glutamate (or glutamatelike) moiety in the S1¢ pocket. In GCPIII, the opening of the `glutarate sensor' is associated with a repositioning of the Asn168-Ile190 fragment (a helix-turn-strandturn-helix motif, a4-b5-a5), adjacent to the S1¢ pocket ° of up to 2.5 A (for Ca of Met182). It is worth noting that, in the rhGCPIII / `pseudo-unliganded' complex, the N-terminus of this segment is flanked by Asn168, a residue with disallowed Ramachandran conformation. Such repositioning was not observed in any of the reported structures of GCPII, although the analysis of the thermal parameters of the recombinant human GCPII (rhGCPII) / phosphate complex, in which the `glutarate sensor' is in open conformation, suggests a higher degree of positional freedom compared to the GCPII complexes that feature the `glutarate sensor' in its closed conformation [27]. There are three sequential Pro residues at positions 136­138 of GCPIII flanked by residues with a high propensity to form a polyproline type II (PPII) helix, which is an important motif in protein­protein interactions [35]. Unlike in GCPII, in which this region is well defined in the electron density map and reveals a perfect PPII helix [27], the electron density for this segment in GCPIII is weak at best. Apart from the apparent flexibility, superposition of the corresponding regions from the GCPII / GCPIII structures reveals quite different conformations (Fig. S5). Furthermore, analysis of the amino acid sequence of GCPIII suggests that the Pro-rich region in this enzyme (residues 135­139: EPPPD) does not represent a common recognition site for SH3 domains (residue sequence XPXXP). GCPII, on the other hand, does contain such a recognition motif [27,36]. The data presented here unequivocally demonstrate that the bimetallic active site of GCPIII is occupied by two Zn2+ ions coordinated in a manner similar to that of GCPII [27]. However, there are several noticeable differences between the states of the Zn2+ sites in the two enzymes. First, despite the conserved Zn2+ coordination shells, there is a considerable difference in the ° ° distance between the Zn2+ ions: 3.7 A versus 3.3 A for GCPIII / L-Glu and GCPII / L-Glu, respectively. This variability stems from positional differences of the His367 and Asp443 side chains (Fig. 2B), with the flexibility of the latter likely being associated with the substitution of Asn519 in GCPII by Ser509 in GCPIII. Additionally, both ion sites are only partially occupied in GCPIII, with the catalytic Zn1 and co-catalytic Zn2 displaying respective occupancies of 0.80­0.95 and 0.45­0.80. The lower occupancy of the co-catalytic Zn2 versus the catalytic metal suggests that the former has a lower binding affinity, which is in agreement

with the binding constants reported for other binuclear proteases [34]. The lower Zn2+ occupancies in GCPIII (compared to GCPII) cannot be unambiguously explained and might, for example, reflect different Zn2+ binding affinities or simply result from different purification protocols. Almost all of the co-catalytic metalloenzymes studied display 75­90% activity with only one Zn2+ ion present, consistent with the theory that the catalytic metal in two-zinc metalloenzymes plays a central role in their activity [34,37]. The suggested role of the co-catalytic zinc ion is to enable productive positioning of the substrate / reaction intermediate [31,34]. In GCPII / GCPIII, there are no direct interactions between the co-catalytic Zn2 and a substrate, although Zn2 is believed to play a role in positioning the bridging water molecule away from the catalytic Glu424 and helping stabilize the transition state [31]. However, additional studies are needed to address these issues in more detail. In each of the four GCPIII complexes reported in the present study, the S1¢ site is (at least partially) occupied by a glutarate fragment of a ligand / inhibitor. The pattern of GCPIII substrate / inhibitor binding is virtually identical to that of GCPII, suggesting that the S1¢ pockets of both proteins are optimized for glutamate binding [27,28] (Fig. 5). However, because of increased rotational freedom of the Ser509 side chain (as opposed to Asn519 in GCPII), the Ser507-Ser509 loop lining the S1¢ pocket appears to be more flexible in GCPIII, allowing GCPIII to accommodate bulkier inhibitor moieties without the need for additional structural adjustments. This characteristic is apparent on comparing complexes of both enzymes with QA. In the GCPII complex, Ser517-Asn519 undergoes relocation upon inhibitor binding and, in addition, a rotation of the Asn257 side chain is necessary to accommodate the bulky oxodiazolidine ring. These observations are in line with the four-fold higher potency of QA towards GCPIII (compared to GCPII) and could be exploited for the design of GCPIIIspecific inhibitors.

include the `entrance lid', Pro-rich region, the loop regions lining the S1¢ site, or the occupancies of Zn2+ sites. All these elements will have to be considered in the future development of any potent inhibitors of glutamate carboxypeptidase activity. Finally, the information provided in the present study should prove to be essential for the structurally-aided design of GCPIII-specific therapeutics and ligands, as well as in the investigation of the diverse biological functions of GCPIII and GCPII.

Experimental procedures
rhGCPIII and rhGCPII expression and purification
The extracellular portions of human GCPII and GCPIII (rhGCPII and rhGCPIII; amino acids 44­750 and 36­740, respectively), were expressed and purified as described previously [25,38]. Briefly, rhGCPIII was heterologously overexpressed in Drosophila Schneider's S2 cells. The protein was purified from the conditioned medium by two ionexchange chromatography steps (QAE-Sephadex A50 in batch, Source 15S column; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) followed by size-exclusion (Superdex HR200 column 16 / 60; GE Healthcare) chromatography. The purified rhGCPIII was dialyzed against 20 mm Mops and 20 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and concentrated to 12 mgÆmL)1 (130 lm) or 125 lgÆmL)1 (1.4 lm) for the structural and kinetic experiments, respectively. For crystallization, the final protein was > 98% pure as determined by silver stained SDS / PAGE. The stock solution was frozen at )80 °C until further use.

Inhibitors
A pure preparation (99%, assayed by TLC) of QA was purchased from Fluka (Sigma­Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of QA in 66 lL of 100 mm NaOH (80 mm final concentration). NAAG was purchased from Sigma­Aldrich and dissolved in distilled water to a final concentration of 20 mm. The synthesis of EPE has been described previously [29]. For crystallization experiments, EPE was dissolved in distilled water to a final concentration of 50 mm.

Conclusions
In the present study, we report the first high resolution structures of human GCPIII and compare them in detail with the equivalent structures of human GCPII. These four structures provide information on the overall architecture of the enzyme and detail enzyme­ ligand interactions in the GCPIII specificity pocket. It is quite evident that, despite high homology between GCPIII and GCPII, several motifs / features located in or around the active sites of these enzymes differ. They

Crystallization, data collection and processing
Initial crystallization experiments were carried out for the complex of rhGCPIII and EPE with the aid of a Phoenix crystallization robot (Art Robbins Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and various commercial crystallization screens at 293 °K. Screening was performed with a 20 : 1 molar ratio of inhibitor and enzyme (12 mgÆmL)1) in the presence of 20 mm Mops (pH 7.4) and 20 mm NaCl in a sitting drop

Crystals belonging to the C2 space group typically appeared within 2 days. Prior to freezing, crystals were briefly soaked in reservoir solutions supplemented with 20% (v / v) glycerol. Each of the four datasets was collected from a single crystal at 100 °K using synchrotron radiation at the SER-CAT sector 22 beamlines of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL, USA) equipped with MAR225 or MAR300 CCD detectors. Data were integrated and scaled using the software package hkl2000 [39].

Determination of inhibition constants
Solutions of rhGCPIII (75 ngÆmL)1 / 830 pm) or rhGCPII (30 ngÆmL)1 / 330 pm) were pre-incubated with varying inhibitor concentrations in 20 mm Mops and 20 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) for 10 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 180 lL. A radiometric assay using [3H]NAAG (radiolabeled on the terminal glutamate) was used to measure the activities, as described previously [25]. The IC50 values were determined from the plots of vi / v0 (i.e. the ratio of individual reaction rates to the rate of the uninhibited reaction) against the inhibitor concentration using grafit, version 5.0.4 (Erithacus Software Ltd, Horley, UK). These were then used to calculate the Ki values using Morrison's formula for competitive inhibitors [46].

Structure solution and refinement
The structure of the rhGCPIII / EPE complex was solved by the molecular replacement method using the software phaser [40], with the previously reported structure of the rhGCPII / QA complex [Protein data Bank (PDB) accession code 2OR4] being employed as the search model [28]. The solution was unambiguous with a final Z-score of 56.3 and a log-likelihood gain of 2604. The remaining three (isomorphous) structures were determined by Fourier difference methods using the rhGCPIII / EPE complex as a starting model. For each structure, iterative cycles of model building and structure refinement were carried out using the software x-fit [41], coot [42] and refmac 5.0 [43]. Models ° were initially refined at a resolution of 2.3 A, and resolution limits were gradually extended to the resolution limits of the data. In the final steps, structural refinement utilizing the anisotropic model for the atomic displacement parameters was used in the case of the rhGCPIII / EPE and rhGCPIII / Glu complexes, whereas the rhGCPIII / QA and rhGCPIII / `pseudo-unliganded' complexes were refined using the isotropic model. The stereochemical quality of the refined structures was analyzed using the software procheck [44] and molprobily [45], and the final statistics are summarized in Table 2.

X-ray fluorescence scans and anomalous maps
To determine the nature of the metals occupying the bimetallic active site of GCPII, we performed X-ray fluorescence scan analysis around the K-edge of Zn2+ ions using a single crystal of the rhGCPIII / EPE complex. The resulting absorption spectrum confirmed the presence of Zn2+ ions in the sample studied (data not shown). To verify and bolster the fluorescence scan results, we collected a complete dataset of diffraction intensities from a single crystal of the rhGCPIII / QA complex at the energy corresponding to ° the Zn2+ absorption edge (k = 1.2759 A). Calculation of the anomalous electron density maps revealed only two anomalous peaks stronger than 5r, and the positions of these peaks matched the metal sites in GCPIII. The heights of these peaks, 70r and 50r, corresponding to Zn1 and Zn2, respectively, indicated that Zn2+ ions indeed occupy the active site of GCPIII, and that the occupancy of at least one site is partial.
