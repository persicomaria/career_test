Summary Metabolic potency of des-(B26-B30)-insulin-B25-amide, [TyrBz5]des-(B26-B30)-insulinB25arnide and [HisB25]des-(B26-B30)-insulin-B25-amide was studied in anaesthetized rats. Compared to insulin, full potency for des-(B26-B30)-insulin-B25-amide and an enhanced potency for both substituted analogues has been described previously on rat adipocytes in vitro. Hypoglycaemic effects following i.v. injection of all of these analogues were almost identical to those of native insulin with a half-maximal effective dose of - 3 nmol *kg- `. Stimulation of glucose metabolism during euglycaemic hyperinsulin-/analogueaemic clamp studies was indistinguishable from that of the native hormone with a maximal stimulation of - 19 mg - kg - ' * min - ' and half-maximal effective hormone concentrations of - 1 pmol~ml-`. Analogue action on individual peripheral tissues estimated by the uptake of 2deoxyglucose as well as stimulation of lipogenesis in epididymal fat was not different to that of insulin. These data demonstrate that C-terminal amidation of des-(B26-B30)-insulin results in a shortened molecule with full in vivo metabolic potency. When substituting phenylalanine in position B25 by tyrosine or histidine, the insulin-identical potency is preserved.

studied, and a biological activity of 20-40% compared to native insulin has been described [ 3-61. Interestingly, however, despentapeptide-(B26B30)-insulin-B25-amide in which the charged Cterminal carboxylate was neutralized showed full in vitro potency when evaluated in rat adipocytes [ 71 and in cultured rat hepatocytes [ 81. Furthermore, related amidated despentapeptide analogues with tyrosine or histidine substitutions at position B25, namely [TyrB2']des-(B26-B30)-insulinamide and [HisB2']des-(B26-B30)-insulinamide, demonstrated an up to threetimes enhanced activity when evaluated in rat adipocytes in vitro [ 9,101. When these analogues were studied in cultured rat hepatocytes, steady-state binding characteristics and a variety of metabolic effects were indistinguishable from those of native insulin [ 81. Previous data from circular dichroism spectroscopy and gel filtration studies suggested that these despentapeptide analogues are monomeric in solution in contrast to the dimerized native hormone [ 71. The absence of selfassociation of insulin analogues has been shown recently to result in an increased rate of absorption following subcutaneous injection of particular analogues, thus mimicking the physiological increments of circulating insulin at meal times more closely [ 111. In the former study, monomeric insulin analogues were obtained by introducing charged amino-acid residues into the hydrophobic carboxyterminal domain of the Bchain, that is responsible for dimerisation of insulin. Since the amidated despentapeptide analogues, which lack this dimer forming domain, have largely preserved in vitro activity, they might eventually be considered as potential therapeutic agents. However, in vivo studies with these analogues have not been reported so far. Thus, the present investigation evaluated their hypoglycaemic potency and their stimulatory action on glucose metabolism assessed by the euglycaemic hyperinsulin/analogueaemic clamp technique in anaesthetized rats following intravenous application. In addition, while using labelled tracers such as [ 14C]glucose and 2-[ 3H]deoxyglucose in clamp studies, analogue actions were simul-

taneously studied at the whole body level and within individual tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.

Materials and methods Materials Chemicals were reagent grade and from commercial sources. Enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, F.R.G.) and porcine insulin from Serva (Heidelberg, F.R.G.); insulin analogues were prepared as described previously [ 7,101. 2-Deoxy-D-[ l-3H]-glucose (specific activity N 14 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham-Buchler (Braunschweig, F.R.G.) and D-[ U-`4C]glucose (specific activity N 4 mCi/ mmol) from New England Nuclear (Dreieich, F.R.G.). The insulin radioimmunoassay kit was purchased from Pharmacia (Ratingen, F.R.G.).

Animals Male Wistar rats (230-290 g body weight) were obtained from Mus Rattus (Brunnthal, F.R.G.). They were kept on a 12-h day/night rhythm with free access to a standard diet (Altromin 1324, (Altromin, Lage, F.R.G.).

Hypoglycaemia Prior to the start of the experiments at 2 : 00 p.m., food was removed from the cages for 8 h to assure absence of ingested nutrients in the intestine and to achieve a similar hepatic glycogen content. Animals were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) and kept on heated covers to maintain body temperature throughout the experiments. After preparation of the right jugular vein a PVC catheter (external diameter -0.8 mm, obtained from Mahrt und Horning, Gbttingen, F.R.G.) was inserted and positioned at the right atrium for injection of hormones and blood sampling. Following an equilibration period of 20 min with repeated threefold determinations of blood glucose concentration

259

(samples of 50 ~1 at lo-min intervals), an i.v. bolus of insulin or the analogues was administered in a volume of 250~1 (0.5, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 12.0 nmol - kg- ' in 0.9% weight/volume (w/v) sodium chloride solution containing 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)). Subsequent blood samples (50 ~1) were collected at IO-min intervals, deproteinized in 500 ~1 perchloric acid (0.33 mol/l) and analyzed for glucose content by the glucose-dehydrogenase method as described [ 121. Hypoglycaemia was quantitated by calculating the area over the curve for individual experiments by the trapezoid method [ 131. The basal line was given by the mean of the three values prior to hormone injection. Euglycaemic clamp studies The animals were fasted for 24 h, anaesthetized, and kept during the experiments as described above. In addition to the venous catheter an arterial cannula was inserted into the femoral artery. According to the method of DeFronzo et al. [ 141 euglycaemic clamp studies were performed by continuous venous infusion (1.2 mleh-`, Unita Ib, Braun, Melsungen, F.R.G.) of insulin or analogues in doses ranging from 0.5 to 13 nmol. kg- ' . h- ' dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution containing 0.3 % BSA and a variable venous infusion of exogenous glucose (O-l.5 ml * h- ' of aglucose solution ranging from 50-120 mg/ml) by using a variable infusion pump (Wissenschaftliche Werkstatten der Universitat Gottingen, F.R.G.). The alterations were made empirically by adjusting the glucose infusion rate in accordance with short-term changes in arterial blood glucose concentrations measured repetitively during the experiments (Beckman Glucose Analyzer II, Beckman, Munchen, F.R.G.). The glucose infusion rate during the last 30 min of the 2-h clamp experiments was taken as a measure of insulin or analogue action on whole body glucose metabolism. Blood samples (200 ~1) for the determination of insulin or analogue concentrations were taken at 0, 90 and 120 min of hormone infusion.

Eflects on individual tissues Insulin and analogue action on glucose uptake in individual tissues during euglycaemic clamping were estimated by the use of labelled 2-deoxyglucase as described by Kraegen et al. [ 151. In brief, animals received an i.v. bolus injection of 2deoxy-D-[ l-3H]glucose (50 PCi in a volume of 300 ~10.9% (w/v) NaCl solution) at 60 min after the commencement of the glucose clamp with subsequent arterial blood sampling for the determination of glucose and 2-deoxyglucose concentrations. At the completion of the clamp (120 min), tissue samples were taken from brain, white and red parts of the gastrocnemius muscle, diaphragm, heart and epididymal fat to be analyzed for the tissue accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose. Analysis and calculation of tissue glucose metabolic index (R,`) was performed as described in detail elsewhere [ 15,161. Insulin and analogue action on stimulation of incorporation of labelled glucose into lipids of epididymal fat pads were estimated in separate experiments with [ U-`4C]glucose (2 pCi as an i.v. injection at 60 min during euglycaemic clamping with tissue sampling at 120 min) as described by Zapf et al. [ 171. Lipids were extracted from adipose tissue according to Stansbie et al. [ 181. Lipogenesis (Q) was estimated by using the following expression :

' = Jz" C.;t).dt where CT* is the lipid extractable radioactivity in the tissue sample accumulated after 60 min, and CP* the plasma radioactivity. Analytical methods Radioactivity in aquaeous samples was counted in 10 ml Hydroluma scintillant (Baker, Deventer, The Netherlands) in a beta-counter (Mark III, Searle, Des Plaines, USA); lipids were counted using 10 ml Instant Szint. Gel II (Canberra Packard, Zurich, Switzerland). Plasma insulin and analogue concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (Ratingen, F.R.G.). The an-

obtained at steady-state (90-120 min) were assayed in duplicate against standard curves of the respective analogue. 1251-labelled insulin was counted with a Gamma-Master 1277 (Ratingen, F.R.G.).
Statistical analysis

Statistical comparison between insulin and analogue actions was done by parametric variance analysis (f-test) and by Student's unpaired t-test [ 191.

and the analogues was noted for lipogenesis in epididymal fat pads during clamp studies. At a maximal effective hormone infusion rate of similar plasma hormone 5Snmol*kgg'~h-' concentrations were observed at steady-state (Table 2). The maximal stimulatory action was similar for insulin and the respective analogues (Table 2).

263 Discussion The amidated shortened analogue des-(B26B30)-insulinamide for which an insulin-identical potency has been reported in vitro previously [7,8] exhibited also full metabolic activity when evaluated in vivo in the anaesthetized rat. Hypoglycaemic effects following i.v. bolus injection as well as stimulation of whole body glucose disposal during euglycaemic hyperinsulin-/analgueaemic clamping were indistinguishable to those of the native hormone. In addition, when glucose uptake in individual tissues and incorporation of glucose into epididymal fat pads were studied during clamping, no difference in insulin and analoguedependent response in a variety of insulin-sensitive tissues could be detected. These data confirm previous in vitro work with rat adipocytes [ 71 and rat hepatocytes [ 81, they are furthermore in accordance with binding data obtained with canine hepatocyte membranes [ 91. However, a slightly higher potency has been reported by others when stimulation of [ 14C]glucose oxidation in rat adipocytes was studied in vitro [ 91. Since the current results of in vivo activity are in accordance with binding data and short- and long-term metabolic effects in cultured hepatocytes as well as with data on lipogenesis in rat adipocytes in vitro [7,8], an insulin-identical metabolic potency can be assumed for des-(B26-B30)Gnsulinamide. The pharmacokinetic properties assessed following i.v. infusion of this shortened amidated analogue were apparently similar to those of the native hormone, since almost insulin-identical steady-state plasma hormone concentrations were achieved during continuous i.v. infusions at various doses. Interestingly, non-amidated despentapeptide and deshexapeptide insulin, while showing lower metabolic potency, exhibited a prolonged plasma half-life and decreased metabolic clearance rate when compared to insulin in anaesthetized dogs [ 61. Thus, the present data are in line with an interdependence of metabolic potency and respective pharmacokinetics that has been observed for a variety of insulin analogues Compared to work performed in conscious rats disposal and glucose uptake of muscle tissues were slightly lower in the present investigation. This is probably due to anaesthesia and has been described previous[ 151, whole body glucose

lY [211.
The present in vivo studies of analogues with substitutions of the amidated B25 residue by tyrosine or histidine revealed an insulin-identical metabolic activity following bolus injection as well as during hyperinsulin-/analogueaemic clamping. Among other insulin-sensitive tissues particularly the stimulation of glucose incorporation into epididymal fat pads was not different to that of native insulin. These in vivo data are at variance with reports of an increased in vitro potency of these analogues observed in rat adipocytes [ 9, lo]. Notably in cultured rat hepatocytes, recent studies demonstrated no difference in metabolic potency either [ 81. An explanation for these equivocal data is not obvious. However, the consistent results in the present in vivo investigation when studying several metabolic actions including stimulation of lipogenesis in epididymal fat pads in vivo suggest that these substituted analogues hardly exceed insulin activity. The potential of insulin analogues for the treatment of diabetes mellitus has been pointed out recently [ 22,231. Particularly monomeric insulin analogues have been regarded as potential candidates when quicker delivery of the hormone following S.C. injection before meals is desired [ 111. Considering the high insulin-identical metabolic potency of monomeric amidated despentapeptide analogues observed in vivo in the present investigation, further characterisation of their pharmacokinetic profile following S.C. injection of an appropriate pharmaceutical preparation appears justified.
