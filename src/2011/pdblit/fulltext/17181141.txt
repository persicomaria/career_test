A prototype compound (7R,7aS)-10b from this series is a potent and highly tissue-selective agonist of the androgen receptor. After oral dosing in a rat atrophied levator ani muscle model, (7R,7aS)-10b demonstrated efficacy at restoring levator ani muscle mass to that of intact controls and exhibited >50-fold selectivity for muscle over prostate.

The endogenous androgens testosterone (Ta) and 5R-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play an essential role in normal male development and the subsequent maintenance of secondary male characteristics, such as muscle mass and strength, body composition, as well as sexual function.1 The physiological effects of androgens are mediated through transcriptional activation of the androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of intracellular ligand-dependent transcription factors.2 As men age, circulating serum T levels decline progressively, which subsequently leads to age-related functional decline (frailty).3 Several recent clinical studies have shown that supplementation of T at physiological doses in elderly men resulted in significant increases in lean body mass and muscle strength and a decrease in adipose tissue.4 However, use of T replacement therapy in elderly men is limited due to concerns about potential side effects, for example, exacerbation of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) or occult prostate cancer.5 In addition, T cannot be administered orally due to its rapid hepatic elimination and, consequently, is given less conveniently by intramuscular injection, surgical implantation, or transdermal delivery using patches or gels.6 Alkylation of steroidal androgens at C-17 as in fluoxymesterone (1) has allowed oral administration, but hepatotoxicity limits the use of such analogues in chronic therapy.7 There has been growing interest in recent years in finding orally active androgens that could offer greater separation between desired anabolic and undesired androgenic effects.8 These efforts have been further stimulated by recent success in developing and marketing selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Several orally active, nonsteroidal selective androgen

receptor modulators (SARMs), such as pyridinoquinoline 29 and the bicalutamide-derived 310 have appeared in the literature, and some of the most advanced compounds emerging from these efforts have been reported to have reached the clinical stage.11 However, these compounds exhibit modest tissue selectivity in preclinical models. Given the ever-growing aging population due to the increase in life expectancy, there clearly exists an unmet medical need for the prevention of functional decline in aging men. Herein we report the discovery of a novel, potent, orally active nonsteroidal SARM scaffold. Compounds based on this core have the potential to provide the clinical benefits of a classical anabolic steroid but with reduced risk of doselimiting side effects. Previous in-house efforts directed at the identification of novel AR antagonist scaffolds led to the discovery of a series of N-aryl bicyclic hydantoins, exemplified by compound 4a.12 Compounds of this chemotype bind tightly to the AR and function as weak partial agonists in AR transactivation assays using the mouse myoblast C2C12 cell line. The in vitro profile of partial agonist 4a (Ki ) 1 nM, EC50 ) 385 nM) encouraged us to conduct structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to improve potency and intrinsic agonist activity. The rationale to utilize the 4a template to develop bicyclic azahydantoin-based AR antagonists was recently disclosed.12 Docking a 4a analogue into the X-ray crystal structure of the DHT-bound wild-type AR ligand binding domain (LBD)13 suggests that 4a binds to the receptor via the nitro group, like the C-3 carbonyl of DHT, forming H-bonds with both arginine 752 (R752) and glutamine 711 (Q711). The [2.2.1] bicyclic portion of 4a occupies the same space as the D ring of DHT. However, this bulky bicyclic moiety and the weak H-bonding interactions with asparagine 705 (N705) and/or threonine 877 (T877) for this compound through the hydantoin backbone N may underlie its weak agonist profile. Such an analysis prompted us to design hydroxylated compounds 7b,c and 10a,b as possible SARMs. We reasoned that improved binding interactions could be achieved both by reducing the bulky [2.2.1] bicyclic hydantoin portion through removal of the bridging ethano unit and by installing a hydroxyl group at either C-6 or C-7 of the outermost 5-membered ring of the resultant bicyclic scaffold to capture stronger H-bonds with N705 and/or T877. A general synthesis of unsubstituted and 6-hydroxy compounds 7a-c is outlined in Scheme 1. Treatment of proline or 4-hydroxyproline esters 5a-c with 4-nitro-1-naphthaleneisocyanate at room temperature yielded urea 6a-c, which were subsequently treated with DBU at elevated temperature to afford compounds 7a-c as either racemic (7a) or diastereomeric (7b,c) mixtures.

When trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline methyl ester 8 was subjected to the same reaction sequence using either 4-nitro- or 4-cyano1-naphthaleneisocyanate (Scheme 2), unexpectedly, a racemic mixture of (()-10a (R ) NO2) or (()-10b (R ) CN) was obtained. These mixtures were resolved by chiral HPLC to provide individual enantiomers (7S,7aR)-10a or -10b [(+)-10a/10b] and (7R,7aS)-10a or -10b [(-)-10a/-10b], respectively. The relative stereochemistry of (-)-10b was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography,14 and the absolute stereochemistry was confirmed by solving a cocrystal complex of (-)10b bound to the AR-LBD (vide infra). To our surprise, the relative stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group and ring juncture in (-)-10b was found to be cis rather than the transstereochemistry of hydroxyester 8. Considering the presence of a -hydroxy amide in bicyclic hydantoin 10, we speculated that formation of (()-10a or (()-10b occurred via retro-Aldol reaction under the strongly basic and elevated-temperature conditions to yield the more thermodynamically favored cisproduct. When urea intermediate 9b was treated with DBU at room temperature for 4 days, (+)-10b was predominantly formed, suggesting that at room temperature the ester group epimerization precedes cyclization to yield (+)-10b. Based on these findings, we designed a stereospecific synthesis of the more active enantiomer (-)-10b, as outlined in Scheme 3. Boc protection of 8, followed by a Mitsunobu inversion of the hydroxyl group of the resultant 11 with benzoic acid, gave diester 12. Treatment of 12 with KOH in MeOH, followed by Boc deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid afforded cis-3hydroxy-L-proline 13. Reaction of 13 with 4-cyano-1-naphthaleneisocyanate at room temperature provided the intermediate

urea, which was subsequently treated with DBU at room temperature to give, after crystallization, enantiomerically pure (-)-10b. Table 1 summarizes the AR binding affinities and transcriptional activities of compounds 4a,b, 7a-c, and 10a,b. Compound 7a (X ) H), a simplified bicyclic hydantoin, retained comparable binding and functional activity to that of the bridged bicyclic 4a. Both 7b (X ) (R)-OH) and 7c (X ) (S)-OH) also showed agonist activity similar to 7a, indicating that a hydroxyl group at the 6-postion of the bicyclic hydantoin core cannot effectively approximate the H-bonding interactions between the native hormones T and DHT with the AR. However, with the hydroxyl group at the 7-position, as in (()-10a (R ) NO2), a more pharmacologically significant result was observed. While the binding affinity for (()-10a remained unchanged relative to the unsubstituted parent 7a, the functional activity was significantly enhanced (>60-fold). Compound (()-10b (R ) CN) exhibited essentially the same binding and agonist functional activity as that of (()-10a. For cyano analogue (()-10b, this represented a dramatic reversal in functional activity, as the corresponding bridged bicyclic analogue 4b (R ) CN) is functionally an AR antagonist, with an IC50 ) 260 nM. This finding was also significant because compounds containing the nitronaphthyl moiety such as 4a tested positive in Ames mutagenicity assays, while the corresponding cyanonaphthyl analogues (e.g., 4b) tested negative. Second, this demonstrated that the specific molecular interactions of the 7-OH group in (()-10 within the AR LBD were sufficient to convert an

antagonist (e.g., 4b) to an agonist ((()-10b). On this basis, (()10a and (()-10b were resolved into their respective pure enantiomers, which were assayed for AR activity. Compound (-)-10b was found to be >500-fold more potent in functional assays than its antipode (+)-10b. Compound (-)-10b was also assayed against other steroid hormone receptors, and found to be >1000-fold selective for AR versus estrogen receptor R and , glucocorticoid receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor, and approximately 270-fold selective versus progesterone receptor (data not shown). As the in vitro profile of (-)-10b closely mirrored that of the native hormones, we proceeded to evaluate the potency and efficacy of this AR agonist at stimulating skeletal muscle and prostate growth in the mature castrated rat, a widely accepted model for investigating anabolic and androgenic activity in androgen responsive tissues.15 In this assay, mature male rats (castrated two weeks prior to the start of the study) were treated with (-)-10b (q.d., p.o.) or testosterone propionate (TP) (q.d., s.c.) for two weeks. At the termination of the study, tissue wet weights were measured and potencies were calculated as ED50 values, defined as the dose at which tissue wet weight reaches 50% that of the corresponding intact sham-operated vehicletreated control animals (Figure 1). TP had an ED50 of 0.21 mg/ kg in the levator ani muscle and an ED50 of 0.42 mg/kg in the prostate, exhibiting 2-fold selectivity for muscle versus prostate, whereas compound (-)-10b exhibited an ED50 of 2 mg/kg in the levator ani and an ED50 of >100 mg/kg in the prostate or >50-fold selectivity for muscle versus prostate. In this same animal model, (-)-10b also suppressed secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) with an ED50 of 60 mg/kg (Figure 2). This corresponds to a 30-fold selectivity for the levator ani muscle stimulation versus LH suppression compared to testosterone propionate, which had an ED50 of 0.26 mg/kg for LH suppres-

sion and essentially no selectivity (1.2-fold) versus this endpoint. In addition to the more obvious rationale for desired selectivity for muscle versus prostate growth, this latter selectivity could potentially be important for minimization of feedback inhibition of LH secretion (and subsequent T secretion) through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. As T is the biosynthetic precursor for estradiol (E2), the lipid balance thought to be maintained in part through appropriate T/E2 ratio in men could potentially be affected by a compound that acts centrally to fully suppress new T secretion. Comparison of the X-ray cocrystal structures of the AR LBD complexed with either (-)-10b or DHT reveals that the nonsteroidal compound has some of the same interactions as those of the endogenous hormone (Figure 3). Residues R752 and Q711 form hydrogen bonds (2.89 Å and 3.36 Å, respectively) with the A-ring carbonyl of DHT in a network that includes a water molecule. For the complex of (-)-10b and the AR, the hydrogen bonds from the cyano group to R752 and Q711 are similar in nature (2.83 Å and 3.45 Å, respectively), but the crystallographic water was not seen for this structure (or other structures determined with analogous compounds), despite the same 2.0 Å resolution for each. At the distal end of the ligands, the DHT D-ring's 17 -hydroxyl group forms strong hydrogen bonds with T877 and N705 at 2.70 Å and 2.80 Å, respectively, whereas (-)-10b forms a single hydrogen bond with N705 at 2.50 Å. An additional significant binding element unique to (-)-10b is seen with the -edge to face interaction between its naphthyl moiety and F764 of the AR. These two key differences allow (-)-10b to have an overall unique binding mode compared with DHT. This may result in altered dynamic
