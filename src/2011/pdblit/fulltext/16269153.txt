The X-ray structure of a new crystal form of chymotrypsinogen A grown from ethanol/ water has been determined at 1.8 A resolution using Patterson search techniques. The crystals are of orthorhombic space group P212121 and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Both independent molecules (referred to as A and B) have been crystallographically refined to a final R value of 0.173 with reflection data to 1.SA resolution. Owing to different crystal contacts, both independent molecules show at various sites conformational differences, especially in segments 33-38, 142-153 and 215-222. If these three loops are omitted in a comparison, the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of the main-chain atoms of molecules A and B is 0.32 A. If segments 70-79, 143-152 and 215-221 are omitted, a comparison of either molecule A or molecule B with the chymotrypsinogen model of Freer et al. (1970) reveals an r.m.s, deviation of the s-carbon atoms of about 0"7 A. Compared with the active enzyme, four spatially adjacent peptide segments, in particular, are differently organized in the zymogen: the amino-terminal segment l 1-19 runs in a rigid but strained conformation along the molecular surface due to the covalent linkage through Cysl; also segment 184-194 is in a rigid unique conformation due to several mutually stabilizing interactions with the amino-terminal segment; segment 216-222. which also lines the specificity pocket, adapts to different crystal contacts and exists in both chymotrypsinogen molecules in different, but defined conformations: in particular, disulfide bridge 191-220, which covalently links both latter segments, has opposite handedness in molecules A and B; finally, the autolysis loop 142 to 153 is organized in a variety of whys and in its terminal part is completely disordered. Thus, the allosteric activation domain (Huber & Bode, 1978) is organized in defined although different conformations in chymotrypsinogen molecules A and B, in contrast to trypsinogen, where all four homologous segments of the activation domain are disordered. This reflects the structural variability and deformability of the activation domain in serine proteinase proenzymes. If the aforementioned peptide segments are omitted, a comparison of our chymotrypsinogen models with 7-chymotrypsin (Cohen et al., 1981) yields an r.m.s, deviation for s-carbon atoms of about 0.5 A. The residues of the "active site triad" are arranged similarly, but the oxyanion hole is lacking in chymotrypsinogen. No significant, relative shift of both constituting domains, as described by Birktoft et al. (1976) to occur upon activation, is observed. In agreement with Freer et al. (1970) we conclude that the inadequate formation of the specificity pocket and the absence of the oxyanion hole are the main reasons for the extremely low catalytic power of chymotrypsinogen. Model building experiments indicate that after some slight rearrangements the chymotrypsinogen segment containing the activation cleavage site should fit to the trypsin binding site.

1. Introduction
Bovine chymotrypsinogen A, the precursor of the A-type chymotrypsins, is one of the major On leave from the Institute of Biophysics, Academia Simca, Beijing, China. 0022 2836/85/190595-30 $03.00/0 595

pancreatic enzymes. It is composed of 245 amino acid residues, which are arranged in a single polypeptide chain, and is cross-linked by five disulfide bridges (Hartley, 1964; Meloun et al., 1966). The zymogen exhibits an extremely small. but significant, intrinsic activity towards active site reagents (Morgan et al., 1972; Gertler et al., 1974; © 1985 AcademicPress Inc. (London)Ltd.

Kerr et al., 1976) and highly reactive small substrates (Lonsdale-Eeeles et al., 1978). After its secretion into the intestine, the chymotrypsinogen is cleaved by trypsin at peptide bond Argl5--Ilel6. This activation cleavage yields the fully active 7r chymotrypsin. Subsequently, autocatalytic hydrolyses of the bonds between residues 13 and 14, 146 and 147, 148 and 149, and stepwise release of the cut-out dipeptides give rise to the 3, 7 and e forms of the enzyme (Kunitz, 1938; Desnuelle, 1960). The first X-ray model of bovine pancreatic ehymotrypsinogen A, derived from an isomorphous 2"5 A Fourier map, has been described by Freer et al. (1970) and Kraut (1971). The crystal form analyzed belonged to space group P212121 and contained one molecule per asymmetric unit. Comparison of the unrefined model with the 2.0 A structure of tosyl-~-chymotrypsin determined by the Cambridge group (Matthews et al., 1967; Sigler et al., 1968: Birktoft et al., 1969; Birktoft & Blow, 1972) revealed that after tryptic cleavage of the Argl5--Ilel6 peptide bond segment 16-21 and segment 191-194 rotate. As a consequence, the Asp194 side-chain can form an internal ion pair with the a-ammonium group of Ilel6, segment 189192 is exposed more to the surface, the partially formed specificity pocket is completed (Steitz et al., 1969) and the oxyanion hole is made (Robertus et al., 1972); on the other hand,.the charge relay system (Blow et al., 1969) was said to be essentially preformed in the zymogen. Later on, Birktoft et al. (1976) described in somewhat more detail the active site of a slightly improved model (of crystallographic R value 0.43), which they derived from a new electron density map after the additional inclusion of anomalous scattering data and using calculated structure factors. In that paper, the authors described the "correct" Ser195 side-chain conformation, which was shown to be similar to that first unequivocally found in bovine trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975). A more spectacular finding, however, was a relative shift of 1-5 A of the two cylindrical folding domains compared with the e-chymotrypsin model. This shift was said to lead to a slight, but important, alternation in the geometry of the active site residues, Independently, Wright (1973a,b) presented a more detailed comparison of both models and tried to estimate quantitatively the contribution to activity of the different sites in the zymogen and in the active enzyme. However, such a comparison was hampered by the fact that at that time both models were in relatively unrefined states and therefore still tentative models (as also emphasized by Kraut, 1971). Therefore, in spite of the now available refined models of 7-ehymotrypsin (Cohen et al., 1981) and ~-chymotrypsin (D. M. Blow, personal communication) an accurate comparison was not yet possible due to the lack of a refined highresolution model of chymotrypsinogen. Another reason why we became interested in a highly accurate chymotrypsinogen model was provided by our structural results obtained for the

related enzyme trypsin and its zymogen. In recent years we have determined the refined highresolution structures of bovine trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975; Bode & Huber, 1978; Walter et al., 1982) as well as of bovine trypsinogen (Bode et al., 1976; Fehlhammer et al., 1977) at different pH values and temperatures as well as in different binding states (Huber & Bode, 1978) and solvents. It turned out that four peptide segments, namely the amino-terminal segment Vall0 to Glyl9 and the internal chain segments Gly142 to Pro152, GlyA184 to Glyl93 and Gly216 to Asn223 are disordered in trypsinogen (even at 103K; see Walter et al., 1982). Upon the activation cleavage of the amino-terminal hexapeptide, the four flexible segments fold together and form the activation domain which contains the specificity pockets as well as the Ilel6 pocket. In contrast to the differences described by Birktoft et al. (1976) for the chymotrypsinogenchymotrypsin system, we could not detect larger conformational differences between the active site residues of trypsinogen and trypsin. Therefore, in apparent contrast to the case of chymotrypsin, the inactivity of trypsinogen compared with that of its active enzyme was mainly ascribed to the disordered binding site, which prevents a stereochemically correct, rigid substrata binding. In the trypsinogen-PTI~ complex (Bode et al., 1978) the trypsinogen component has adopted an active enzyme-like conformation similar to that observed in the trypsin-PTI complex (Huber et al., 1974). We could show that such a transformation into the conformationally active state can also be induced by dipeptides closely related or similar to the newly formed amino terminus, for example Ile-Val (Bode & Huber, 1976). These observations led us to assume for the zymogen-aetive enzyme pair a twostate model (Bode, 1979; Huber & Bode, 1978) with an only partially folded, inactive zymogen and a completely folded active enzyme. These findings and ideas seemed to disagree partially with those reported by Kraut and his colleagues. This was the more inconceivable due to the apparent very close relationship between the structures and functions of trypsin and ehymotrypsin. Interestingly, homologous segments that are disordered in our trypsinogen models were shown to be placed differently in chymotrypsinogen and e-chymotrypsin. And, according to Wright (1973a,b), a kink was always observed in the chymotrypsinogen Fourier map at the same residues that mediate flexibility in trypsinogen. In addition, according to electron density plots shown by Wright (1973a) and Freer et al. (1970), those segments seemed to be relatively poorly defined in the chymotrypsinogen
map.

modified by W . S . Bennett. Data processing was performed using the P R O T E I N program system of Steigemann (1974). Of 87,718 individual measurements above the 2a significance level, 32,818 unique reflections corresponding to 690/0 of the expected reflections to 1.8 A resolution were obtained. The final Rmor,e, defined as ~(I(i)-(l})/~I(i), was 0.086 (I(i) and ( I } are the intensity values of individual measurements and of the corresponding mean values; the summation is over all measurements). (c) Patterson search Patterson search methods (Huber. 1965; Fehlhammer & Bode, 1975; l~ossmann & Blow, 1962; Colman et al., 1975) were used to determine the orientation of the molecules in the unit cell. Since there are 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, first a self-rotation search was done in order to find the non-crystallographic symmetry elements. The crystal Patterson synthesis was calculated with a 1 A grid using all reflections from 15 A to 3 A resolution. The product correlation was calculated as a function of the orientation angles in 2 stages. In the first stage a self-rotation function of the Patterson map was calculated, where ¢, ~, ~ (polar angle definition) were varied in steps of 5 ° for ~ = 180 ° in the angular range ~b = 0 ° to 180 °, ~ = 0 ° to 180 °, to find a local 2-fold axis. In the second stage a general rotation function of the Patterson function was calculated, gb, ~h and ~ were varied in steps of 5 o in the angular range ¢ = 0 ° to 180 °, ~h = 0 ° to 180 ° and K = 0 ° to 180 °. Subsequently a fine scan was done in steps of 0'5 ° around the peaks of highest correlation. The grid points representing the 1500 highest function values within a radial shell between 5 and 20 A were selected from the Patterson synthesis. Following the self-rotation, a cross-rotation search was performed with the 7-chymotrypsin model (Cohen et al., 1981) as well as with the tosyl-a-chymotrypsin (Birktoft & Blow, 1972) and the chymotrypsinogen model (Freer et al., 1970). The co-ordinates of these models were taken from the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Solvent molecules were omitted, and the residues 1-19, 35-40, 70-79, 142-152, 184-195 and 216-224, which either differed considerably between the a-chymotrypsin and chymotrypsinogen models or corresponded to flexible parts in the trypsinogen model (Bode et al., 1976), were omitted from the y-chymotrypsin and tosyl-a-chymotrypsin models. Each model was placed in a trielinic cell with orthogonal axes of length 75 A. Triclinic structure factors were calculated from 15 A to 2.5 A resolution assuming an overall temperature factor of 18 A 2. A 2.5 A model Patterson map with grid spacings of 0'8 A was then calculated, and the grid points representing the 3500, 4000 and 3000 highest function values of the GCH, ACH and CHG maps, respectively, within a radial shell of 5 to 20 A were selected. The crystal Patterson synthesis was calculated using all reflections from 15A to 2.5A resolution and a 0.8A grid spacing. The product correlation of the crystal and the model Patterson maps was calculated as a function of the orientation angles ~b, 0 and ~ (Eulerian angles) in steps of 5 ° in the angle range ¢ = 0 ° to 180 °, 0 = 0 ° to 180 °, ~ = 0 ° to 180 ° , and subsequently in smaller steps of 0.5 ° around high correlation peaks. The location of the 2 correctly oriented molecules was determined using the translation function of Crowther & Blow (1967) and programs written by E . E . L a t t m a n n and implemented by J. Deisenhofer. In this stage only the model of y-chymotrypsin (Cohen et al., 1981) was used

2. Materials and Methods
(a) Crystallization Bovine chymotrypsinogen A (80 mg/cm3: Merck, Darmstadt) was crystallized by vapor diffusion in 30% (v/v) ethanol, buffered with 0.2 x-phosphate to pH 4-5; 2"5 mg/cm 3 of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Trasylolt®), trademark of Bayer, Leverkusen) kindly supplied by Dr Truscheit (Bayer A.G. Wuppertal) were added in order to prevent activation or autocatalytic cleavage. The orthorhombic-prismatic crystals grew to sizes up to 1 mm. According to symmetry and systematic extinctions these crystals belong to 2 closely related orthorhombic crystal forms, A and B, of identical space group P212121, but of slightly different cell constants. FormA: FormB: a=60.2A, a=59.3A, b=76'6/~, b=77.1A, c=104'4A. c=ll0.1A.

Form A had been found and described by Bluhm & Kendrew (1956) and assigned as type C. Because of the slightly better quality and reproducibility, only the form B crystals were used in the present X-ray analysis. As determined from their initial buoyant density in an aqueous Ficoll 400 (Pharmacia, Uppsala) density gradient according to a procedure first described by Westbrook (1976), but recently modified by us (Bode & SehirmeL 1985). these crystals contain 2 molecules per asymmetric unit. They diffract to minimal Bragg spacings beyond l ' 8 A resolution. Polyacrylamide gel eleetrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and activity measurements of the dissolved crystalline material before and after activation with trypsin proved that the crystals consist of activatable single-chain chymotrypsinogen. (b) Data collection and processing Data were collected at 17°C from four different crystals with rotation-precession cameras of Enraf-Nonius (Delft, the Netherlands) and Huber (Rimsting, F.R.G.). Graphite-monochromatized CuK~ radiation from a Rigaku Denki rotating-anode generator and Kodak NS-2T no-screen X-ray films were used. Films were scanned on a rotating-drum densitometer (Optronies) linked to a VAX 11/782 (Digital Equipment), and evaluated using programs of Schwager et al. (1975),

distance of 3-5 A from at least one other polar protein group or another water molecule. On the basis of the final model, possible hydrogen bonds were searched for, including bound solvent molecules using the program HYBAC (Levitt, 1974). The proposed hydrogen bonds with donor-acceptor distances below 3 ' 5 A and angular relations according to the criteria given by Chothia (1975) were further checked visually for their plausibility. In the whole investigation the structure factors and R values: (R = ~(llFobsll- IIF=a,cll)/~llFobsII) were calculated with F F T routines obtained from L . F . Ten Evck and later modified and implemented by S. T. Remington into the P R O T E I N system. The grid spacing of the Fourier and difference Fourier maps was about one-third of the limit of resolution of the data used.

for the search. The model Fourier transform was calculated for orthogonal cell axes of length 90 A using data from 15A to 2.5A resolution. The translation function was determined in steps of 0-8 A. The unit cell contains 4 crystallographically symmetrical molecules (1, 3, 5 and 7) of type A and 4 erystallographically symmetrical molecules (2, 4, 6 and 8) of type B. First, molecules A and B were correctly oriented corresponding to the solutions of the orientation search. The translation functions were then calculated according to the procedure shown in Fig. 1. In a second step the relative positions of molecules A and B were determined by a crosstranslation search between molecule 1 and molecule 2. (d) Model building and crystallographic refinement The positional and orientational parameters obtained from the Patterson search were further refined in reciprocal space using the program CORELS (Sussman et al., 1977) and data to 3 A resolution and treating both molecules in the asymmetric unit as independent rigid bodies. The resulting atomic model was then subjected to 4 cycles of energy refinement, using the program E R E F (Jack & Levitt, 1978). The model building started with the correctly oriented and located 7-chymotrypsin models from which residues 1-19, 35-40, 70-79, 142-152, 184 195 and 216-224 had been deleted. All Fourier maps were calculated with 2Fob~--F¢~l¢ coefficients and Sim-weighted model phases (Sim, 1959; Hendrickson & Lattman, 1970). The models and electron density maps were inspected on a Vector General 3400 interactive display system interfaced to a PDP 11/40 using the program FRODO (Jones, 1978). The residues were adjusted to fit the electron density map as well as possible. Crystallographic refinement was performed in a cyclic procedure using the reciprocal space refinement with energy restraints E R E F (Jack & Levitt, 1978). The procedure used in this investigation is based on the programs D E R I V (Jack & Levitt, 1978) and E R E F (Levitt, 1974), modified and implemented by Deisenhofer. The derivatives at the atomic positions are estimated from a difference Fourier map. The shifts are then applied to the model, minimizing the function E+kA. E is an empirical potential energy function that contains terms for bond length stretching, bond angle bending, torsion angle rotations and non-bonded interactions; A is the crystallographic residual, and k is a scale factor relating the 2 contributions (Jack & Levitt, 1978). When convergence of the refinement was achieved the resulting refined model was used to calculate a 2Fobs - F¢al¢ Fourier map, against which the model was rebuilt on the interactive display system. The combined procedure of model building and crystallographic refinement described above was repeated several times. Individual temperature factor shifts were calculated for each active atom from the difference Fourier synthesis, also using the program DERIV. These were then treated in 3 different ways during the refinement process: first, they were averaged so that each residue received 2 temperature factors, 1 for the mMn-chain (including Cfl) and 1 for the side-chain: subsequently, for each atom they were averaged over the direct neighbor atoms so that each residue had more than 2 temperature factors; at the final stage of refinement isotropic B values were assigned to individual atoms. Solvent molecules were gradually included into the model. Peaks were identified as water molecules when they had well-defined electron density and were within a

(e) Structural comparison
Comparisons between the 2 independent molecules A and B and between these and the models of several related structures were performed using the least-squares program ROTMOL (W. Steigemann), which minimizes the deviations of equivalent atoms and gives the best orientation matrix and translation vectors that transform a compared structure (set2) to the refined chymotiTpsinogen A model (set 1). The chymotrypsinogen enumeration (Hartley & Shotton. 197t) was used throughout.

omitted for phase calculation, were rebuilt against the current electron density maps. At stages 2 and 3, the most interesting segments related to the activation of the zymogen and activity of the enzyme (residues 11-19, 185-195 and 216-221) were inspected and rebuilt. The electron density corresponding to these residues appeared to be clear and well-defined, except segment 219-221. Attempts to locate solvent molecules were started at stage 3. Only those peaks that were well-defined in the Fourier map and located within a distance of 3"5 A to a polar group or another water molecule were accepted as water molecules. In stages 4 and 5 the less well-defined segments 35-39, 75-79 and 143-152 became traceable. Since structural differences were expected for these residues (Freer et al., 1970; Birktoft & Blow, 1972; Cohen et al., 1981; Bode et al., 1976), these parts were modeled separately for the two independent molecules. Residues Asp35, Lys36 and Thr37 were shown to possess different conformations in the two independent molecules. Whereas the main-chain and the side-chains could be traced and built without problems in molecule A, there was only weak and discontinuous density for molecule B. In both molecules, the main-chain of residues 75-79 could be traced, whereas the side-chains of Ser75, Ser76 and Lys79 were not well-defined. The conformation of segment 143-152 was shown to be rather different in both molecules. In molecule A the main-chain and the side-chains between residues Leu143 and Ala149 were well-defined (Fig. 3), except for some disorder of the side-chain of Arg145. There was no interpretable, continuous density for Asnl50 to Pro152. In contrast, this loop segment could not be traced in molecule B from Arg145 onwards. The final R value is 0.173 for 30,617 reflections in the resolution range 6.0 A to 1.8 A. In the final model 3489 non-hydrogen atoms of the protein and 330 water molecules are defined. Table 6 gives the mean values and standard deviations of several bond lengths and bond angles for the final model.

The R value was reduced to 0.388 in the resolution range 6.0 A to 2-5 A. Four cycles of E R E F refinement without visual inspection and manual changes improved the R value to 0.314 in the same resolution range. The resulting atomic model was used for subsequent phase and Fourier calculation and as a starting model for model building. The course of the refinement is summarized in Table 5. Within seven stages, essentially segments 1-19, 35-40, 70-79, 142-152, 184-195 and 216-224, which had been

especially in segment 72-78, in the loop segment 93-98 and in the carboxy-terminal helix, starting with Va1235. This latter segment deviates also in kallikrein considerably, thus indicating a relatively large preparedness to adapt to different environments. There are, of course, many large deviations in side-chain atoms, most of which are located on the surface of the molecule and mainly involve lysine, glutamine and asparagine residues. Although the main-chain segments 189-195 are remarkably similar, the side-chains of Ser189, Cysl91 and Ser195, which are important for substrate binding and activity in the active enzyme, differ considerably in their conformations in the zymogen molecules A and B (Fig. 9). The Or atom of Ser195 is fixed in molecule A (with an individual temperature factor of 12 ilk2), but is evidently not defined in molecule B (Fig. 10). The torsion angles of the five disulfide bridges are listed in Table 8 for ehymotrypsinogen molecules A and B and for ~and ?-chymotrypsin. Most remarkably, the disulfide bridges between Cysl91 and Cys220 are of opposite conformations, namely right-handed in molecule A as in a- and ?-chymotrypsin, but left-handed in molecule B (see Table8). As also shown by Figure 9, the differences reside mainly in the sidechain conformation of Cysl91 and in the mainchain position of Cys220 (Table 8). The remaining disulfide bridges are similar in molecules A and B and are in accordance with those given for ?-chymotrypsin, and by Freer et al. (1970) for chymotrypsinogen (Table8). The apparent discrepancy in the conformation of disulfide bridge 1-122 between ~- and ?-chymotrypsin has now been shown to be due to an erroneous interpretation of the original a-chymotrypsin Fourier map (D. M. Blow, personal communication). Disulfide bridge 168-182, which turns out to be of different orientation in bovine trypsin and porcine kallikrein compared with ehymotrypsin (Bode et al., 1983), has similar conformations in both chymotrypsinogen molecules as in the active enzyme. (iii) The general conformation of bovine chymotrypsinogen With the exception of four segments, namely Aspll to Glyl9, Leul43 to Asp153, Serl86 to Asp194 and Gly216 to Ser223, the conformation of the polypeptide chain of ehymotrypsinogen (Fig. 6) is very similar to that of ~- and y-ehymotrypsin (Birktoft & Blow, 1972; Cohen et al., 1981). As in all other related serine proteinases, the polypeptide chains form two structurally similar hydrophobic interacting domains, which both participate in forming the catalytic and the substrate binding site. In each barrel-like domain, the polypeptide chain is folded to form extended, twisted fl-pleated sheets.

Figure 12. Sections of the final Fourier map of ehymotrypsinogen around Vall7 of (a) molecule A and (b) molecule B superimposed on the model. In addition to the helical strands 165-172 and 231-245, also observed in chymotrypsin, there is a slight indication of a small 31o helix from Trpl41 to Tyr146 in molecule A. I t is worthwhile to note further the " n o r m a l " main-chain angles at Ser214 (which are in all serine proteinases of unfavorable energy and located in an "unallowed" region of the R a m a c h a n d r a n plot; see Bode et al., 1983), and the strained conformation of Vall7 found in both molecules A and B of our model, as in the model of Freer et al. (1970), who do not, however, explicitly discuss this unusual conformation. The conformational angles of Vall7 are 49 ° and 46 ° for q5 and --106 ° and - 1 0 3 ° for ¢ in A and B, respectively. T h e y are positioned in an unallowed region of the R a m a e h a n d r a n plot shown in Figure 11. The corresponding distance between Vall7 Cp and Asnl8 N is only 2.8 A in both molecules; t h a t is, quite short. In the final Fourier m a p the electron density is well-defined around both Vall7 residues (Fig. 12) and allows only a model fit with the mainchain conformation as given above.

chymotrypsinogen model presented by Freer et al. (1970). The largest main-chain deviations (of up to 3 A for molecule A, but only 1 A for molecule B) are observed in segment 215-221, where° however, molecules A and B differ also considerably from one another. Main-chain displacements above 1 A further occur (for molecule A as well as for molecule B) around residues 24-26, 43, 91, 98, 169-178 and 202, i.e. at sites exposed to the surface. The quite different orientation of the indole side-chain of Trp215 in the model of Freer et al. (1970) is quite remarkable, compared with the conformation universally observed in molecule A and B as well as in 7-chymotrypsin and trypsin. I f segment 215-221 as well as segments 70-79 and 143-153, which are only weakly defined in the Fourier map of Freer et al. (1970) and are not given in their co-ordinate set deposited at the Brookhaven Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977), are omitted the overall r.m.s, deviation of all main-chain atoms is 0.70 A and 0.75 A for molecules A and B, respectively. This value is considerably larger than that obtained from a comparison between molecules A and B. (ii) Comparison with chymotrypsin As shown by Cohen et al. (1981), their 7-chymotrypsin model closely resembles the models of the related a-chymotrypsin presented by Birktoft & Blow (1972) and by Tulinsky et al. (1973). Because at the time of writing only the co-ordina¢es of the 7-chymotrypsin were available in a refined state, this model will mainly be compared with our chymotrypsinogen models (according to new coordinates kindly provided by D.M. Blow before publication, the refined models of a-chymotrypsin and y-chymotrypsin are indeed quite similar). General structure. In Figure 13 the deviations of homologous, defined a-carbon atoms between each chymotrypsinogen molecule and y-chymotrypsin are plotted versus sequence number. As can be seen, the largest differences in the main-chain positions between the zymogen and the active enzyme are found in four segments, which also contribute to the activation domain, namely Ilel6 to Glyl9, Leul43 to Aspl53, Ser186 to Asp194 and Gly216 to Thr222. The dipeptides 14-15 and 147-148 are missing in both active enzymes. Residues l l - 1 3 and 149 and 150 are disordered in y-chymotrypsin and are not included in the comparison. Besides these segments. only the loop segment Asp35 to Phe 39 turns out to differ significantly. This loop is involved in intermolecular crystal contacts in both zymogen molecules as well as in 7-chymotrypsin. Therefore, the differences observed m a y not necessarily reflect the characteristic conformational changes occurring upon activation. With the exception of the five segments mentioned above and listed in Table 9 with their a-carbons, the polypeptide fold of the zymogen is very similar to that of the active enzyme (Fig. 14). The r.m.s, deviation is about 0 . 5 A for both molecules A and B (and about 0 . 6 A for the partially refined a-chymotrypsin model). The

corresponding transformations giving the optimal superposition of 7-chymotrypsin (x, y, z) onto molecules A (xl, yl, zl) and B (x2, y2, z2) of ehymotrypsinogen are: (xl) (-0.39575 -0.90984 -0.12483) (x) (15.3855) (yl) = (0.27559 -0.24732 0.92892) · (y)+(36.0020) (zl) (-0.87610 0-33324 0.34864) (z) (39.0276) (x2) ( - 0 . 2 5 0 3 2 - 0 . 9 5 5 6 5 - 0 . 1 5 5 3 0 ) (x) (0.6473) (y2) = (-0-93485 0-19676 0-29553) · (y)+(46.1584) (z2) (-0.25187 0.21913 -0.94263) (z) (78-2384). I f we fit both barrel structures independently, then the r.m.s, deviations are slightly smaller for the amino-terminal than for the carboxy-terminal barrels. Substrate binding pocket. In a- and y-chymotrypsin (Steitz et al., 1969; Segal et al., 197l) it has first been shown that the specificity pocket is defined by the chain segment Ser189 to Ser195, which forms one side of the pocket, and by segments Ser214 to Cys220 and Pro225 to Tyr228, which form the other side of the pocket.

gives a view into the pocket showing most of these segments as observed in the zymogen (molecule A), together with homologous segments of chymotrypsin optimally superimposed. The most evident differences in defined segments between zymogen and enzyme are found for residues Serl89 to Asp194 (Fig. 13). Owing to a displacement of the whole main-chain this deviation starts already at Gly184 (5C~ 0-7 A) and amounts to about 2.5 A (for mainchain atoms) between Ser189 and Cysl91 C~. In chymotrypsinogen, Glyl87 0 and Ser189 N are involved in two hydrogen bonds with Vall7 (Table 10). The peptide groups and side-chains of segment Ser189 to Cysl91 are of different orientation in ehymotrypsinogen and ehymotrypsin. Also disulfide bridge 191-220 is organized in different conformations before and after activation (see Table 8) but already shows much variability between molecules A and B (see above and Fig. 9). The sulfur atoms of Cysl91 and Cys220 are displaced by 4.1 A and 4.8 A, respectively, in both ehymotrypsinogen molecules compared with y-ehymotrypsin. The main-chain takes completely different courses in Cysl91 C= and Asp194 C=. I t is folded inwards in the molecule of ehymotrypsinogen, but extends as an extraneous loop towards the solvent and forms the "lower lip" of the pocket (in the orientation given in Fig. 15) in ehymotrypsin. In spite of this deviating conformation the main-chain and side-chain atoms of this loop segment possess relatively low B values in both structures (Fig. 8). The most displaced residue is Met192. Its C= atom deviates for 7.6 A and its side-chain atoms (Sa and C=) deviate up to 12.2 A. The Met192 side-chain is completely buried in the zymogen (Fig. 15). I t is

--17 ° . In its zymogen position, each of both carboxylate oxygens forms a favorable 2.8A hydrogen bond with His40 N ~2 and Trp141 N, respectively. In addition, each carboxylate oxygen is close to a localized internal solvent molecule (So1608 and 714 in molecule A and Sol610 and 717 in molecule B; Fig. 16). In the course of activation the carboxylate group of Asp194 rotates towards the newly liberated a-ammonium group of lle16 to form the well-known salt bridge (Fig. 16). This inwards rotation is coupled with the outwards rotation of the 191-194 loop mentioned above. Both other segments that line the pocket (213220 and 225-228) are of similar conformation before and after activation. As can be seen in Figures 13 and 15, segment 213-220 is, however, considerably displaced. The deviation becomes significant at the peptide group of Gly216 (5C: 0.8 A), amounts to 3.2 A at Cys220 N, and is back at the r.m.s, value of Ser223. As mentioned above, this segment is, in both independent zymogen molecules, involved in different van der Waals' contacts with neighboring molecules. These intermolecular contacts are particularly close for Cys220 S~ of molecule B. With the exception of both Cys191-Cys220 sulfur atoms, which exhibit quite large B values, the temperature factors of the remaining atoms of this segment are close to the overall B value in both zymogen molecules (Fig. 8). The residues following Cys220 in the peptide chain possess even lower B values, in clear contrast to trypsinogen (Fehlhammer et al., 1977). As can be derived from Figure 15, part of segment 141-146 of chymotrypsin is in close contact with the peptide chain 191-194 including disulfide bridge 191-220, which form the "lower lip" of the pocket. Up to Gly142, segments 141-146 are parallel in chymotrypsin and in chymotrypsinogen. Peptide group Gly142 is, however, oppositely oriented, and the following main-chain is organized differently in the zymogen and in the active enzyme. The relative shift of this chain segment from Leu143 onwards, observed between both chymotrypsinogen molecules (Fig. 9), is much smaller and again explainable by different cell contacts. Activation cleavage site. The disulfide bridge CyslCys122 is of nearly identical conformation in both zymogen molecules and in y-chymotrypsin (see above and Table 8). Up to about Val9 the aminoterminal peptide chain runs rather similarly in chymotrypsinogen as in the active enzyme and interacts in both molecular states through the same groups with the main molecular body. Only two of these contacts are inter-main-chain hydrogen bonds (Gly2 N to Alal20 O; Gly2 0 to Trp207 N). From Leul0 onwards the amino-terminal chain deviates in chymotrypsinogen compared with chymotrypsin. In y-chymotrypsin residues 11-13 are positionally undefined and extend presumably out into the solution; Serl4 and Argl5 have been excised in the course of activation. In contrast, the continuous peptide chain is well-defined in chymotrypsinogen

(with the exception of the side-chains of Glu7 and Argl5) and of similar conformation in both independent molecules. At Glyl2-Leul3 and Argl5-Vall7 the displacement of the chain segments of both independent molecules is slightly above the r.m.s, value (up to 0-7 A; the largest main-chain deviations at this site compared with the model of Freer et al. (1970) are about ] A). The main-chain B values are, however, still below the overall temperature factor (Fig. 8). In both zymogen molecules, two hydrogen bonds (Serll O to Serl4 N and Glyl2 0 to Argl5N) are formed between groups of this main-chain itself. They help to stabilize the structure of this amino-terminal segment. As can be derived from Figure 17, the segment from Ilel6 to Glyl9 is folded into a turn (Ilel6 0 to Glyl9 N: 2.9 A), which due to its ¢ and ¢ angles at Vall7 and Asnl8 (49 ° , - 1 0 6 °, - 1 2 2 ° , 26 ° for molecule A; 46 °, - 103 °, - 109°, 25 ° for molecule B) can be classified as a type II' turn. As pointed out by Crawford et al. (1973), this turn requires a glycine residue at position 2 for an intact, favorable 1--4 hydrogen bond. In fact, the torsional angles observed at Vall7 in both independent molecules (see Fig. 17) lead to a rather close contact between Vall7 Cp and Asnl8 N (see the Ramachandran plot in Fig. I 1). Vall7 forms, through its amido nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen, two favorable hydrogen bonds (Fig. 17) with Gly187 O and Serl89 N (of 3-1 A and 2.9 A, 2"8 A and 2.7 A in molecules A and B, respectively). In Table l l the conformational angles around the cleavage site of chymotrypsinogen are given together with the corresponding angles observed in the binding segments of the protein inhibitors bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Huber et al., 1974) and the third domain of the ovomucoid inhibitor from Japanese quail (Papamokos et al., 1982). Whereas Argl5 and Ilel6 are relatively similar in conformation to the P1 and PI' residues of these inhibitors, the residues in P2 and P2' positions show large differences. After activation cleavage, the newly liberated amino-terminal Ilel6-Vall7 peptide segment relaxes and binds into the newly formed Ilel6 pocket (Fig. 17). The conformational change that occurs, consists mainly of a 170° rotation around the N ~ C ~ bond of Glyl9 (with 0 changing from 83 ° to - 8 7 °, see Table 13), of a rearrangement of the preceding main-chain bonds, and of a slight movement of Glyl9 towards the main molecular body (Fig. 17). In the active enzyme Vall7 is positioned at the entrance of the Ilel6 poeket and has quite normal main-chain torsional angles. From the amide nitrogen of Glyl9 onwards the aminoterminal chain segments run almost parallel in the zymogen and in the active enzyme. At Gln20 the main-chain displacement is already similar to the overall r.m.s, deviation. Active site. As mentioned above, the Ser195 0 ~ of chymotrypsinogen is well-defined by electron density in ehymotrypsinogen molecule A (Fig. 10(a)), but only poorly defined in molecule B

Figure 18. Active site residues of 7-ehymotrypsin (double line connections) optimally superimposed on the same residues as observed in molecule A of ehymotrypsinogen (filled bar connections). (Fig. 10(b)). This difference is probably caused by the proximity of the Lys36 of a neighboring molecule (Fig. 10(b)). The relative positions and conformations of all other active site and surrounding residues are very similar in both independent chymotrypsinogen molecules. As shown in Figure 18 and listed in Table 12, there are only quite sm~ll deviations between most of the active site residues in 7-chymotrypsin and chymotrypsinogen. Only Ser195 deviates significantly, up to 0.8 A at its main-chain atoms (probably reflecting the quite different conformations of the preceding chain segment; see above). and for 1.1 A in its O ~ position. Also its side-chain dihedral angle Z1 (which defines the conformation about the C~--C p bond) differs in that it is - 9 6 ° in chymotrypsinogen, but - 4 4 ° in 7-chymotrypsin. Nevertheless, in both cases this side-chain is in the "'down" orientation that is also found in other serine proteinases (Matthews et al., 1977). The distance between Ser195 0 ~ and His57 N ~2 is 2.75 A in chymotrypsinogen molecule A and thus is significantly shorter than in 7-chymotrypsin (3.8 A; Cohen et al., 1981). Furthermore, in the zymogen the O ~ atom is only 0-25 A out of the plane of the imidazole ring compared with 0-7 A in the active enzyme. Therefore, the hydrogen bond between O ~ and N ~2 is of favorable stereochemistry in the zymogen in contrast to 7-chymotrypsin, where it virtually does not exist. The rather low pH value of 4, at which the data ha~e been collected, should be considered. At this pH value in the zymogen, as well as in the active enzyme, the enzymatic activity is lowered by several orders of magnitude (Gertler et al., 1974). As demonstrated for bovine trypsin crystals (Huber & Bode, 1978), this tremendous reduction of activity at low pH values is not accompanied by significant conformational changes within the catalytic triad. Thus, the inactivity must be due to protonation (of the imidazole ring of His57). The relatively favorable hydrogen-bond interaction between Ser195 and His57 in molecule A, as well as the undefined conformation in molecule B, probably reflects more the existing environment (as, for example, exclusion of localized solvent molecules) in this crystal cell than specific properties of the active site residues in ehymotrypsinogen. The hydrogen bonds and the corresponding bond distances to and between the other active site residues (Aspl02, Ala56, His57 and Ser214) remain rather similar in the course of activation. In particular, no significant relative shift of the two cylindrical domains can be detected from a comparison of the zymogen with the active enzyme. Neither are larger side-chain movements observable in the vicinity of the active site residues of Ile99, Ser214 or segment 214-216, for example, as had been suggested by Freer et al. (1970). (iii) Comparison with bovine trypsinogen Both ehymotrypsinogen molecules A and B have also been compared with bovine trypsinogen (Bode et al., 1976; Fehlhammer et al., 1977). In order to remove any influence of the ethanolic solvent, the comparison was actually done with the trypsinogen model obtained at room temperature after transfer

Broken lines in the trypsinogen model indicate disordered segments given with the conformation observed in bovine trypsin. Orientation as for Fig. 9.

to an aqueous methanol solution (TNME; Singh et al., 1980; Walter et al., 1982). I f only internal, ordered segments (as defined by Huber et al., 1974) are included in the comparison, the r.m.s, deviations for all main-chain atoms are 0.81 A and 0.83 A for molecules A and B, respectively. These deviations are similar to those obtained from comparisons between refined models of homologous serine proteinase structures (Bode et al., 1983). The transformation that converts bovine trypsinogen (xl, yl, zl) into molecule A of chymotrypsinogen (x, y, z) is: (x) (0.79950 -0-07503 -0.46927) (xl) (-22.5615) (y) = (0.35443 0-11400 0.87253) · (yl)+ (12-6954) (z) (0.48510 -0"99097 0-13603) (zl) (19"3572). In Figure 19 the peptide chain of molecule A of chymotrypsinogen, represented by its a-carbon atoms only, is optimally superimposed on the peptide chain of bovine trypsinogen (Fehlhammer etal., 1977). The trypsinogen segments 10-19, 142-152, 184-193 and 216-223, which are undefined in the trypsinogen electron density map, are shown in a conformation similar to t h a t observed for fl-trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975). With the exception of these segments the main-chain is arranged similarly in both zymogens. Larger deviations occur mainly at some external loops and represent in most cases fundamental differences between both enzyme species, but m a y in a few cases result from crystal contact deformations (Huber et al., 1974), The considerable deviations at the calcium loop (Bode & Sehwager, 1975) could in part reflect the different protonation states of the glutamic acids involved in calcium binding (the p H value in the chymotrypsinogen crystals was 4"0, but was neutral in the trypsinogen crystals).

The conformation of Asp194 is common to both zymogens. The main-chain atoms are relatively similar from Asp194 C~ on (0"6 to 0-7 A). Owing to a slight rotation about the C~--C bond, the amido nitrogen and the Cp atom deviate considerably more (2.4A and l ' 4 A , respectively), whereas the carboxylate groups of both zymogens again occupy more equivalent positions and are involved in identical hydrogen bonds with His40, T rpl41 and solvent molecules. Asp194 Cp and~ even more, 194 N are only weakly defined in trypsinogen (Fehlhammer et al., 1977), probably indicating some torsional motion about the C~--C bond, but a stronger fixation of the terminal carboxylate group due to hydrogen bonding. In the trypsinogen crystals as well as in the crystals containing the t r y p s i n o g e n - P T I complex the amino-terminal segment is at room temperature undefined up to Glyl8 and defined by gradually increasing electron density from Glyl9 onwards (Fehlhammer et al., 1977). Our interpretation is that the preceding amino-terminal segment is not fixed in a preferred conformation, but extends with a more random conformation out into the solution. This conclusion is in agreement with recent nuclear magnetic resonance data (Perkins & Wuethrieh, 1980). At 103K in the trypsinogen crystals also, parts of Vail7 and Glyl8 are fixed to the molecular surface. The preceding residues including the activation cleavage site 15-16 are, however, also still disordered at very low temperatures. As shown in Table 13, the conformation of the first three defined residues (17-19) of this trypsinogen structure at low temperature is quite different from those observed in the active enzyme or in chymotrypsinogen. Unlike the crystals of trypsinogen or

trypsinogen-PTL the amino-terminal segment of the trypsinogen component of the complex formed with PSTI (Bolognesi et al., 1982) is ordered, due to specific crystal contacts, and can be traced in the electron density map from Aspl4 onwards. The conformation from Glyl8 to Tyr20 is similar to that observed in the active enzymes. Segment Ile16 to Glyl9 (compare with Fig. 6 of Bolognesi et al.. 1982) is folded into a reverse turn. In contrast to chymotrypsinogen this turn is, however, of type I' and has quite normal torsional angles at its second residue (Vall7). Nevertheless, in this trypsinogen component Vall7 and Glyl9 make similar contacts with the main molecular body as, for example, a hydrogen bond between Vall7 0 and Serl89 N. The scissile peptide bond Lysl5--Ilel6 is, however, kinked in trypsinogen-PSTI so that the preceding amino-terminal segment of trypsinogen must be localized at quite different surface regions compared to chymotrypsinogen.

4. Discussion

Bovine chymotrypsinogen exhibits no tendency for dimer formation in solution at low pH values and low ionic strength (Schwert, 1949), in contrast to the clear evidence for a dimerization of ~-chymotrypsin under these conditions (see Birktoft & Blow, 1972). This finding agrees with the molecular arrangement found in our orthorhombic crystals, in which in spite of the quasi-equivalent packing of both independent chymotrypsinogen molecules no distinct separated dimers are detectable. Because the rotational and translational searches were performed with models corresponding to only about half of the content of the asymmetric unit, we originally expected to meet larger difficulties in using these methods. The unequivocal solutions obtained in both kinds of searches were therefore surprising and may be explained by the quite good quality of the models used for the search. The presence of two molecular copies in the asymmetric unit offered the excellent possibility of studying the influence of crystal contacts on the structure and (including the model of Freer et al. (1970)) of determining the intrinsic properties of the chymotrypsinogen molecules as they may appear in
21

solution. In general, the zymogen structure as presented by Freer et al. (1970) and the conformational changes suggested to occur upon activation were confirmed by our analysis. The inclusion of reflection data of higher resolution and particularly the crystallographic refinement turned out to be important, however, in order to produce reliable models and to determine unequivocally the degree of order of the peptide segments that participate in the activation domain. From our experiences with trypsinogen crystals immersed either in methanolic or in magnesium sulfate solutions of high ionic strength (Walter et al., 1982), the influence of differing mother liquors should almost be negligible. Thus, the considerable deviations between our models and those presented by Freer et al. (1970), which are much larger than those between both independent molecules A and B, are presumably to a large extent due to differences in refinement, and represent to only a small extent real conformational differences due to different crystal packing. A general feature of the zymogen shared by all three independent chymotrypsinogen molecules is the grossly changed conformation of four spatially adjacent chain segments compared with chymotrypsin: (1) The amino-terminal segment 11-18 is fixed in one predominant conformation on the molecular surface. Around Va117 an unusual turn of considerable sterical hindrance is observed. The positive free-energy contribution imposed might be paid for by hydrogen bonds formed within this segment as well as to peptide segment 187-189. Chymotrypsinogen is a physiological substrate of trypsin. In vitro, bovine chymotrypsinogen A is cleaved at its Argl5--Ilel6 bond by bovine trypsin with a kca t value of 0.18s -1 and a K m value of about 1 mM (Abita et al., 1969). This kcat value is, for example, about two orders of magnitude larger than that found for the autocatalytic cleavage of the homologous Lysl5--Ilel6 bond of bovine trypsinogen or of its isolated amino-terminal nonapeptide. It is, however, still one order of magnitude below kcat values of homologous hepta- or nonapeptides, in which the aspartate residues typical of the amino-terminal segment of various trypsin species are replaced by alanine residues (Abita et al., 1969). The K m value of the tryptic activation of chymotrypsinogen is, however, similar to that for

622

the autocatalytic activation of trypsinogen~ but an order of magnitude lower and higher, respectively~ than the Km values observed for the oligopeptides containing or lacking aspartate residues. Thus, the binding of the catalytic cleavage segment of chymotrypsinogen to trypsin and its cleavage are not exceptional compared with isolated flexible peptides, but are still more efficient than those derived for the floppy, amino-terminal segment of trypsinogen. The high affinities of small protein inhibitors (like PTI and the ovomucoid inhibitors) to serine proteinases are usually ascribed to the extremely good fit of their reactive segments towards the complementary binding sites of the target enzymes (Huber & Bode, 1978; Laskowski & Kato, 1980). A comparison of the reactive segments (Table 11) reveals that the main-chain angles at P3, P1 and PI' are similar in these inhibitors and in chymotrypsinogen, whereas the ~ angle of the P2 residues and both main-chain angles of the P2' residues deviate considerably. As a consequence, the loop segment containing the cleavage site of chymotrypsinogen is much narrower than the reactive segment of the inhibitors, so that in this conformation not as many favorable contacts could be made between enzyme and substrate. Nevertheless, an inspection of the model shows that Argl5 and its adjacent peptide groups are already in almost adequate conformations to allow most of the interactions considered to be .necessary for an efficient cleavage (as e.g. at the carbonyl group of P2, at the amide nitrogen and at the side-chain of P1, at the scissile peptide bond itself, and at the amide nitrogen of P2'; see Huber & Bode, 1978). Preliminary docking experiments performed at the interactive display further indicate that in an encounter complex, formed between the trypsin and the chymotrypsinogen molecules, as observed in their crystals, segments Serll to Leul3, Gly133 to Thr134 and Prol61 to Leu162 of chymotrypsinogen, would come into too-close contact with residues around the active site (His57, Ser214 and Trp215) and the autolysis loop, respectively, of trypsin. Taking into account the considerable flexibility of the autolysis loop in trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975), an efficient activation cleavage would mainly require a slight deformation of the chymotrypsinogen segment containing the activation cleavage site. Such a rearrangement, which must occur in the millisecond range according to the cleavage kinetics, is conceivable due to the high energy conformation of this activation segment. (2) The "autolysis loop" is obviously the most flexible of these four segments characteristic of chymotrypsinogen, because it shows a high conformational variability from Leu143 onwards and disorder to varying degrees in segment 145-152. Thus, the side-chain interaction of Arg145 is apparently not specific and may not have a particular stabilizing role, in contrast to proposals of others (Wright, 1973b). As shown by the structure of single-stranded bovine fl-trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975), upon activation this loop will

initially fold into a more defined structure. After the subsequent cutting out of peptide 147-148 this loop retains considerable mobility in a and ?-chymotrypsin (Birktoft & Blow, 1972; Cohen et al., 1981). The "floppy" character of this loop in chymotrypsinogen will allow it to assume conformations complementary to proteinases. This susceptibility explains the relatively efficient chymotryptic cleavage of chymotrypsinogen occurring at Tyr146 to Tyr147 and Asn148 to Ala149 and yielding Thr- and Ala-neoehymotrypsinogen (Rovery et al., 1955). Recently, we have taken advantage of this susceptibility of chymotrypsinogen to produce gently and to crystallize a modified human ~l-proteinase inhibitor (Loebermann et al., 1982). According to sequence analyses, in the complex formed between the ~l-proteinase inhibitor and bovine chymotrypsinogen the zymogen had been cleaved in its autolysis loop by a contaminant proteinase. Obviously this cleavage implied a destabilization of this complex, which therefore dissociated into neochymotrypsinogen and modified inhibitor. (3) By far the largest conformational changes between zymogen and active enzyme occur in the well-defined segment 184-194, especially between Ser189 and Asp194, as already described by Freer et al. (1970). The main-chain and side-chain atoms of residues 187-189 and Met192 are in close contact with the activation peptide. The low accessibility of the buried side-chain of Met192 in chymotrypsinogen adequately explains the considerable reduction in oxidation rate of Met192 in chymotrypsinogen compared with ehymotrypsin (Wasi & Hofman, 1973). According to inspection of the model, a methionine sulfoxide oxygen atom could only be accommodated after the expulsion of an internal water molecule (So1627). As a consequence, the oxidized Met192 would favor an active enzymelike conformation, which in turn could explain the increased reactivity of such an oxidized chymotrypsinogen towards active site titrants (Gertler et al., 1974). In spite of the apparent rigidity of this mainchain segment, the appending disulfide bridge 191220 is flexible enough to be arranged with different handedness in both independent chymotrypsinogen molecules. Nevertheless, the fixed conformation explains its non-reactivity towards sodium borohydride, which is in contrast to the reactivity of the homologous disulfide bond of trypsinogen (Light & Sinha, 1967). (4) This variability of the disulfide bridge obviously extends into the fourth deviating segment, namely loop 216-221, which is slightly mobile and can thus adopt to different contacts provided by neighboring molecules. In spite of the large apparent differences, the chymotrypsinogen and the trypsinogen models now provide a relatively common picture of their activation domains. The amino-terminal segment of chymotrypsinogen up to Glyl9 is fixed to the molecular surface in a distinct, high-energy conformation different from the active enzyme; in

Structure of Chymotrypsinogen A

623

trypsinogen it is shorter and the lack of a n y covalent linkage up to G l y l 9 makes it much more flexible. Segment Gly184 to Asp194 differs in both zymogens in conformation from t h a t observed in the active enzymes; owing to mutual stabilization with the amino-terminal segment, it is folded in chymotrypsinogen in a distinct conformation different from the active enzyme, but is completely disordered in trypsinogen; the common conformation at Asp194 in both zymogens indicates t h a t the preceding 191 194 segment of trypsinogen m u s t take a similar t r a c k as the homologous segment in chymotrypsinogen, but with much larger spatial freedom. Peptide segment Gly216 to residue 222 (or 223) and disulfide bridge 191-220 are flexible in both zymogens. T h e y are completely disordered in trypsinogem but only partially mobile in chymotrypsinogen due to more interactions with fixed segments in the neighborhood. And finally, the autolysis loop is disordered in both zymogens, but again to a larger extent in trypsinogen. Thus, in chymotrypsinogen the stronger fixation of the amino-terminal segment is t r a n s m i t t e d through mutually stabilizing interactions to the other segments, leading to a defined, but " s o f t " conformation; owing to the minor conformational restraints of its amino-terminal segment, no predominant conformation is selected and stabilized in trypsinogen. I n both zymogens neither the specificity pocket nor the I l e l 6 pocket is adequately built to bind specific substrates and the I l e l 6 Vall7 amino terminus rigidly. The formation of the I l e l 6 - A s p l 9 4 salt bridge, which leads to a molecular structure of lower free energy, is cooperatively linked with the creation of a rigid activation domain containing a correctly shaped specificity pocket, a c o m p l e m e n t a r y l l e l 6 pocket and a functional oxyanion hole (Bode, 1979). This general concept of an allosteric activation domain very p r o b a b l y holds also for the zymogens of all other serine proteinases of the trypsin type. The co-ordinates of both chymotrypsinogen molecules A and B will be deposited at the Brookhaven D a t a B a n k (Bernstein et al., 1977). The receipt of a grant (D.W.) given by the Alexandervon-Humboldt-Stiftung, and the financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 207, project C-7) are greatly appreciated. The disposal of the refined co-ordinates of a-chymotrypsin by Dr D. M Blow prior to publication is acknowledged.
