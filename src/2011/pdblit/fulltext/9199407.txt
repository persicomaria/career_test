The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a heterodimeric cell-surface protein consisting of two chains, a and b, each of which is composed of a variable (V) and a constant (C) domain. Crystals of the isolated Va domain of the murine TCR 2C were grown by serendipity from a solution containing the extracellular domains of the intact TCR 2C and CD3 ge-chains. The Va crystal structure shows how crystal packing can substitute for another Va domain in a different fashion from that observed in Va/Va homodimer and Va/Vb heterodimer structures. Signi®cant conformational changes occur in the CDR3 and b3b4 loops that normally form part of the dimer interface. The monomeric Va domain provides the unique opportunity to study the effect of dimerization on the conformation of the unliganded complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of a TCR. This structure of an individual Va module has implications for stability and bioengineering of isolated antibody and immunoglobulin domains.

During immune recognition, peptides derived from self and non-self proteins are complexed to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and presented to T-cell receptors (TCRs) on the cell surface.1,2 In the presence of a foreign peptide antigen, the interaction of the peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex with the TCR is the committed step of a signaling pathway that eventually leads either to the killing of the antigen-presenting cell (class I) or T-cell help to produce antibodies (class II). Class I MHC molecules present peptides to TCRs on cells that additionally harbor the co-receptor CD8 (CD8), while class II MHC molecules interact with TCRs on CD4 cells. TCRs are disul®de-linked heterodimers whose a and b chains

both consist of an N-terminal variable (V) and a C-terminal constant (C) domain. The V domains carry the so-called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable loops that are present in both antibodies and TCRs. The CDRs show great sequence variation among TCRs and are primarily responsible for speci®c peptide recognition.3 Several crystal structures of unliganded homo- and heterodimeric intact TCRs or fragments,4 ± 8 and of TCR/pMHC complexes9 ± 14 have provided our current insights into the mode of peptide recognition by the CDR loops and in the conformational ¯exibility of the V domains. By serendipity, we crystallized an isolated Va domain from a complex mixture consisting of the heterodimeric murine TCR 2C, and the CD3 gechains. The monomeric Va entity in the asymmetric unit of the crystal exposes a large hydrophobic surface area that is buried in a non-homodimeric fashion by a crystallographic symmetry mate. Although homodimer formation is possible in principle, it is not seen in this crystal form. The loops adjacent to the dimer interface undergo signi®cant conformational changes that are transmitted to other parts of the Va domain. Even though these movements are not relevant in light of peptide

2 recognition because of the non-natural state of the Va domain, they provide valuable insights into the assembly of hydrophobic protein-protein interfaces and V domain association. Additionally, the Va structure has implications for the biogenesis of the native TCR and for the bioengineering of a stable TCR V domain with potential therapeutic applications. Comparison of Va domains in TCR 2C structures Assembly of the TCR and signal transduction upon TCR/pMHC interaction are controlled by the CD3 g, d, e, and z chains. To understand the molecular basis of the TCR/CD3 interaction, we initially sought to crystallize a complex of TCR 2C and the CD3 ge-chains. However, from this mixture, crystals grew that only contained the Va domain. Since the puri®cation of the proteins involves thrombin and carboxypeptidase treatment, this fortuitous result is probably due to residual protease activity during crystallization. The fact that the crystal harbors only the intact Va

domain indicates that this domain either is exceptionally stable or is incorporated into the crystal lattice at a faster rate than the proteolysis reaction. The quality of the electron density map is good to excellent (Figure 1; Table 1), including the CDR loops, which in the other unliganded TCR structures or fragments tend to be disordered.5 ± 7 The C terminus of the Va domain was identi®ed as Asn115 of the TCR 2C a chain, due to lack of clear electron density beyond this residue (Figure 1). However, this may not represent the actual C-terminal residue of the protein, since the C-terminal peptide of Va points into a solvent channel, without any interactions with other protein atoms. The 2C Va structure superimposes closely with the Va domains of TCR 2C (PDB entry 1tcr)7 and the Va homodimer (PDB entry 1ac6)6 with rms Ê (root-mean-square) deviations of 0.85 A (114 Ca Ê atoms) and 1.10 A (104 Ca atoms), respectively (Figure 2). Overlay of the 2C Va domain with all other Va domains, for which coordinates are available, results in relatively small rms deviations of Ê up to 1.4 A, even for sequence similarities as low

Proteins were produced in a glycosylated form in Drosophila melanogaster insect cells. Puri®cation of the TCR 2C was as described,38 with hydrolysis of the C-terminal His-tag by carboxypeptidases A and B. The CD3 g and e sub-units, which contained a His-tag, were treated with thrombin and carboxypeptidase B and re-puri®ed by Ni2-NTA af®nity and anion-exchange chromatography. Protein crystals were grown at 25  C from sitting drops by mixing 100 mM TCR 2C and CD3 ge-chains with reservoir solution (1 M Na2-tartrate, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1 M imidazole/HCl (pH 7.5)). Data were collected on a single, ¯ash-cooled (30 % glycerol in mother liquor) crystal at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) at beamline 9-1 on a Mar345 imaging plate. Data reduction Ê was carried out using the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite.39 The space group was I4122 with unit cell dimensions of a  104.0 A and Ê Ê Ê c  63.1 A. Molecular-replacement and rigid-body re®nement (10 A to 4 A data) using AMoRe40 and the TCR 2C Va domain (residues 1 to 115) as the search model yielded a clear solution (R  37.5 %, correlation coef®cient (CC)  0.63). Further rigid body re®nement in CNS 41 was followed by several rounds of simulated annealing starting at 2000 K, conjugate gradient minimization, and restrained individual temperature-factor re®nement against the maximum likelihood target.42 Bulk solvent correction using a ¯at model and anisotropic correction were used throughout the re®nement except for rigid-body protocols. The re®nement progress was judged by monitoring Rfree for cross-validation.43 The model was rebuilt into sA-weighted 3Fo À 2Fc and Fo À Fc difference electron density maps44 using the program O.45 Water molecules were assigned throughout the re®nement for >3s peaks in an Fo À Fc map and retained if they satis®ed hydrogen-bonding criteria and returned 3Fo À 2Fc density after re®nement. Following convergence in CNS, a further drop of 2 % in Rfree was achieved by re®ning all protein atoms as one anisotropic domain with the TLS procedure in REFMAC5.46 Only the libration tensor was signi®cantly anisotropic. The ®nal model comprises residues 1 to 115 of the TCR 2C achain, 44 water molecules, and an NAG residue at Asn70. The quality of the model was assessed with the programs PROCHECK47 and WHATCHECK.48 In total, 85 % of residues are in the most favored regions with no residues in the generously allowed or disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot49 (Table 1). Surface-complementarity coef®cients16,50 and solvent-accessible surface areas51 Ê were calculated with the programs SC and AREAIMOL, respectively, as implemented in CCP452 using a 1.7 A probe radius.

as 36 % within the superimposed regions. Thus, the overall fold of the 2C Va domain remains surprisingly well ordered, despite the lack of the potentially stabilizing interactions of the native TCR. The most marked conformational changes occur in the CDR loops (Figure 2), which indicates that the Va domain comprises a rigid scaffold for the mobile CDRs. Superposition of the 2C Va domain and the unliganded and liganded 2C TCR reveals that the backbone trace of CDR1 (residues 24-32) in 2C Va lies between those of the unliganded and liganded 2C structures. All three conformations are of canonical type a1-215 with Pro30 pointing into the center of the loop and van der Waals contacting Tyr24 and Leu32. The mean rmsd value of the Ê CDR1 loops is only 0.44 A; however, equivalent Ê main-chain atom distances are in the range 2-3 A

(see below). The conformations of the CDR2 loop (residues 49-54) in 2C Va and TCR 2C, both liganded and unliganded, are very similar (mean Ê rmsd 0.37 A) with only minor rigid body displaceÊ ments ($1.1 A). This is consistent with CDR2 not being part of the dimer interface in native TCRs. While the CDR3 (residues 93-105) loop conformations in liganded and unliganded 2C TCR are almost perpendicular to each other,7 the CDR3 loops in 2C Va and unliganded 2C TCR share the same topology of a b-hairpin. However, CDR3 is part of the natural Va/Vb dimer interface and Ê rigid-body shifts by 2.0 A in Va relative to its position in unliganded TCR 2C. This conformational change is possible due to the loss of interactions with the Vb domain. As a result, CDR3 in Va reorients away from its position in the Va/Vb dimer

The Ca trace of the monomeric Va domain (red) is superimposed in stereo view with the Va domains of unliganded TCR 2C (green), the TCR 2C/H-2Kb/dEV8 complex (blue), the Va domain from TCR 2.6Ja38 (khaki), and the Va/Va homodimer from TCR 1934.4 (purple). The CDR loops and the dimer interface are indicated.

interface with a concomitant rigid-body shift of Ê the neighboring CDR1 loop of 2.3 A. Similarly, a substantial conformational change, presumably also due to lack of dimer formation, occurs at Ê residue 40 of the b3b4 loop, which moves $3 A away from its position in the Va/Vb dimer interface of TCR 2C (Figure 2). Thus, the monomeric Va domain undergoes a compaction relative to its form in the Va/Vb heterodimer of TCR 2C. The CDR1a, CDR3a, and CDR3b loops in the 2C TCR/pMHC complexes undergo similarly large conformational changes relative to the unliganded state.7,13 However, the CDR3a loop stands out among them because at the same time it maintains contacts to the Vb domain, thus essentially serving two functions - pMHC recognition and domain assembly. It appears, therefore, that structural plasticity of the CDR3 and other loops close to the dimer interface serves to maximize inter-molecular contacts in the authentic TCR. At the same time, the CDR3a and the CDR3b loops can adjust to the pMHC surface when it forms the TCR/pMHC complex.7,9 ± 14 In conclusion, while the magnitude of the CDR conformational changes in Va is on the same order as in other TCRs, TCR/pMHC complexes, and antibody structures, the CDR3a and b3b4 loops display monomer-speci®c conformational changes. Nevertheless, the overall structure of the Va module by itself is remarkably similar to its complexed forms.

Alternate V domain dimerization and crystal packing Individual domains that are part of multidomain proteins are often stabilized by domaindomain interactions. TCRs are assembled from ab or gd dimers, each comprising four domains, but structures of individual TCR domains and fragments have been determined. These include two TCR 1934.4 Va/Va homodimers, which differ by a few mutations in their CDR3 loops,5,6 a monomeric TCR 2.6 Ja38 Va domain,8 a monomeric TCR ES204 Vd domain 6, and a TCR 14.3d b chain.4 This raises the question of whether V domains are generally stable in isolation or need to be stabilized by, for example, crystal packing. To investigate the lack of dimer formation in the 2C Va crystal, an arti®cial model of the Va dimer was created in the crystal lattice of the mutated 1934.4 Va/Va homodimer determined by Li et al.6 This 2C Va homodimer model had no steric clashes and 45 productive van der Waals interactions (though no hydrogen bonds). Thus, a homodimeric 2C Va structure is stereo-chemically possible. However, the Va domain in our crystal form is glycosylated, whereas the 1934.4 Va/Va homodimer was unglycosylated, as it was produced in Escherichia coli.6 A severe clash between the N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) attached to Asn70 in the 2C Va/Va model and a symmetry mate in the crystal lattice of the 1934.4 Va/Va homodimer would preclude dimer formation and crystallization in the space

5 autonomous folding units whose stability does not necessarily rely on complex formation in the authentic TCR. This fact might explain the presence of a cross-linking disul®de bond in the native, heterodimeric TCRs in vivo, such as to ensure their correct chain pairing and, hence, acquisition of antigen-recognition properties. Towards engineering stable, isolated V domains with immunosuppressive properties TCRs and antibodies recognize and speci®cally bind to their cognate pMHC complexes and antigens through the CDR loops on their V domains. Engineered antibody fragments have been used in the clearance of cancer cells and in the treatment of autoimmune diseases that are correlated with defective T-cell recognition of self-pMHC complexes, such as insulin-dependent diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.20 ± 23 Also, they may be applicable for blocking T-cell reaction to bacterial superantigens. For the success of this technology, the proteins must be stable and bind their targets with high speci®city and af®nity.24 Because of the structural similarity of antibody and TCR V domains and the hypervariability of the antigen-recognizing regions, TCRs may be suitable for a similar approach in treating autoimmune diseases. In general, TCRs are less ef®ciently expressed in bacteria, are much less stable than antibodies, and have a much lower substrate af®nity.25,26 A recent report using an evolutionary approach revealed that linked V domains of the 2C TCR (scTCR) could be stabilized without the loss of pMHC ligand-binding properties, thereby exploiting TCR diversity in a similar way as antibodies to generate pMHC-blocking agents.27 Still, it may be anticipated that an isolated V domain of simpler architecture is even more stable and likely to provide the higher levels of expression needed for therapeutic uses. This minimalistic approach to developing a TCR-based V domain of therapeutic value is validated by the observation that, in the crystal structures of TCR/pMHC complexes, the contacts between TCR and pMHC may be dominated by one of the two V domains. For instance, in the BM3.3/PBM1/H-2Kb complex, the Vb domain accounts for the majority of these contacts,14 whereas in the A6/Tax/HLA-A2 and B7/Tax/ HLA-A2 structures, the Va domain contacts the pMHC more extensively than the Vb domain.9,10 Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the staphylococcal enterotoxin superantigen interacts predominantly with the Vb domain of the TCR28 and that a scTCR can be endowed with high af®nity for the superantigen.29 Interestingly, in camelids $40 % of all antibodies consist of the heavy chain only, and their variable (VHH) domains display extreme thermostability up to 90  C.30,31 The CDR3 loop in these antibodies can be suf®cient for high-af®nity binding and inactivation of enzymes,

group of the Va/Va homodimer (P212121). This, however, does not exclude the possibility that a glycosylated Va/Va homodimer could crystallize in a different space group. The extensive hydrophobic Ê Ê Ê surface area of 1650 A2 and 1420 A2 (1.7 A probe radius) that is buried between the Va and Vb domains in TCR 2C and in the 1934.4 Va/Va homodimer interface, respectively, suggests a high af®nity of the individual domains for each other. Only two direct hydrogen bonds per monomer exist within the Va/Va homodimer interface5 and the 2C Va/Vb structure, stressing the importance of the 60 and 84 van der Waals interactions for Va/Va homo- and Va/Vb heterodimer formation, respectively. Comparison of the surface complementarity coef®cients (Sc)16 of the 2C Va/Vb heterodimer and the 1934.4 Va/Va homodimer of 0.66 and 0.63, respectively, further suggests a signi®cant propensity for homodimeric interactions. In the 2C Va Ê crystal, 1090 A2 of the normal hydrophobic Va/Va interface are buried by interaction with hydrophobic residues from the CDR loops of a symmetry-related molecule in an almost perpendicular fashion. This non-standard involvement of CDR loops in complex formation is also present in the crystal structures of the CTLA-4/B7-117 and CTLA4/B7-218 complexes which co-stimulate immune responses. The Sc value of 0.61 for the 2C Va crystallographic interaction is close to the values observed in actual Va dimeric structures. Phe95 of CDR3 is an important contacting residue that interacts with Tyr35, Leu43, Leu99, and Phe101 of the symmetry mate. Similarly, Tyr31 of CDR1 and Tyr50 of CDR2 interact with the b3b4 loop (Figure 2), which is also normally part of the natural VaVb dimer interface. However, if this interaction provided very high stability, its periodic nature (as seen in the crystal lattice) would suggest that the protein would aggregate in solution. This seems unlikely given the successful crystallization of the Va domain. Thus, despite extensive van der Waals contacts and reasonably high surface complementarity, that can lead to formation of either Va/Va homodimers or VaVb heterodimers, a wellordered monomeric Va structure can exist in the crystal lattice, and probably also in solution. Interestingly, the Va domain of TCR 2.6Ja38 has no tendency to dimerize in solution,19 or in the crystal lattice,8 indicating that it also is stable by itself in solution. In 2.6Ja38 Va, the normal dimer interface is shielded by the b3b4 loop, which packs tightly against the hydrophobic residues in this area. Another mode of shielding the hydrophobic dimer interface in crystal structures of TCR fragments is the lateral association of domains, for example of Vb in the TCR 14.3d b-chain structure4 and of Vd of the TCR ES204.6 While some of these VbVb and VdVd interactions are analogous to those in the authentic TCRs, this interaction mode poses the CDR loops on opposite sides. Overall, this potential of TCR V domains to exist as monomers, or to form homodimers, shows that they comprise

6 as exempli®ed by the crystal structure of a camel single-domain antibody/carbonic anhydrase complex.32 However, humanization of camel antibody domains is necessary to avoid adverse immunological responses. With the now growing structural library of TCR V domains, it becomes apparent that the isolated TCR V domain scaffold, analogously to antibody VH domains, could possibly be exploited for medical purposes. All of the six mutations that stabilize the 2C scTCR are framework residues.27 Two of the residues are present in the 2C Va structure (Trp82 and Leu43), and it is instructive to compare their environment in the three 2C Va crystal structures. The stabilizing effect of the Trp82Arg mutation in the 2C scTCR is most likely due to a reduction in hydrophobicity which additionally may improve its solubility.27 This residue is normally buried in the interface with the Ca domain forming van der Waals interactions with Pro116, Val167, and the methylene groups of Lys176. By contrast, in the isolated Va structure, the indole side-chain of Trp82 adopts a different rotamer compared to the 2C TCR and stacks against His81. This stabilizing stacking interaction in 2C Va, however, does not preclude the solvent exposure of Trp82 and the reduction of solvent-accessible hydrophobic surface is known as a general way to achieve increased protein stability.33 The Leu43Pro mutation is located in the dimer interface having virtually the same conformation in all 2C Va structures. Since the hydrophobicity of the dimer interface does not change signi®cantly due to the mutation, a likely reason for the stabilization of the 2C Va domain is the rigidity of the proline residue. Restriction of the conformational freedom, and thereby destabilization, of the unfolded state is a well-known strategy, also adopted by thermophilic organisms, to increase protein stability.33 Thus, stabilizing mutations found for scTCR are probably also stabilizing the 2C Va domain. This opens up the possibility of both rationally and evolutionary design V domains with improved stability. For the stabilized Va domains to be effective pMHC-blocking agents, their af®nity needs to be increased. TCR/pMHC interactions are typically characterized by equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) in the micromolar range34 ± 36 and the af®nity of an isolated V domain for its cognate pMHC complex is likely to be even lower. But it is possible to create, by directed evolution using bacteriophage or yeast display, scTCRs that have Therefore, such nanomolar af®nities.27,37 approaches should, in principle, be applicable to the generation of stable, high-af®nity V domains of potential therapeutic use.
