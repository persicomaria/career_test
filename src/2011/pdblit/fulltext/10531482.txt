Retinoids play important roles in diverse cellular processes including growth, cell differentiation and vision. Many natural and synthetic retinoids are used as drugs in dermatology and oncology. A large amount of data has been accumulated on the cellular activity of different synthetic retinoids. They are stabilized and transported inside the cell cytoplasm by binding and transport proteins, such as cellular retinol-binding proteins and cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs). The structures of human CRABP II in complex with two different synthetic retinoids, Ro13-6307 and Ê Ro12-7310 (at 2.1 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively) and of bovine CRABP I in complex with a retinobenzoic acid, Am80 Ê (at 2.8 A resolution) are described. The binding af®nities of human CRABP I and II for the retinoids studied here have been determined. All these compounds have comparable binding af®nities (nanomolar range) for both CRABPs. Apart from the particular interactions of the carboxylate group of the retinoids with speci®c protein groups, each structure reveals characteristic interactions. Studying the atomic details of the interaction of retinoids with retinoid-binding proteins facilitates the understanding of the kinetics of retinoid traf®cking inside the cytoplasm.

1. Introduction
Retinoids play important roles in a multitude of cellular process including vision, cell differentiation (Saari, 1994; Hofmann & Eichele, 1994), embryonic development and pattern formation (Morriss-Kay & Sokolova, 1996) and programmed cell death (apoptosis; Horn et al., 1996). Both natural and synthetic retinoids possess anticarcinogenic properties (reviewed by Hong & Itri, 1994) and are candidates for drug design (Lotan, 1996). Some of these compounds have been used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (Chomienne et al., 1996) and certain skin diseases (Fisher & Voorhees, 1996). Retinoids exert their effects by binding to nuclear hormone receptors (RAR, RXR) which act as ligand-activated transcription regulators for speci®c genes (Mangelsdorf et al., 1995; Chambon, 1996). Retinoids are present in the cell in their alcohol, aldehyde, acid and ester forms, which are mutually interconvertible by different enzymes. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) and 9-cis retinoic acid have been identi®ed as being principally responsible for the interaction with nuclear hormone receptors. Since a shortage or an excess of retinoic acid can cause malfunctioning of retinoid-signalling pathways, maintenance of the retinoid homeostasis in the cell is very important. The concentration of retinoids is controlled in the cell cytoplasm by retinoid-binding proteins, such as cellular

retinol-binding proteins, cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs) and cellular retinaldehyde-binding proteins. Cellular retinoid-binding proteins protect the cell from these amphipathic molecules, protect the retinoids from oxidative degradation and control the availability of retinoids for various metabolic processes (Ross, 1993; Ong et al., 1994; Li & Norris, 1996; Napoli, 1996). The concentration of the retinoidbinding proteins in the cell largely exceeds those of the ligands and they display very high af®nity (nanomolar range) for their ligands. These proteins have different spatial and temporal distributions in tissues. It has been shown that the ratio of cellular retinol-binding proteins with and without ligand is crucial for maintaining a balance between the various competitive processes in retinoid metabolism (Napoli, 1996). However, a similar functional role for the CRABPs has yet to be established. Cellular retinoid-binding proteins from different species display a high degree of sequence similarity and have very similar structures (Banaszak et al., 1994). These proteins belong to a superfamily of lipid-binding proteins which share a -barrel motif with an internal cavity that binds and stabilizes small hydrophobic/amphipathic ligands (Jones et al., 1988; Banaszak et al., 1994; Newcomer, 1995). Crystal structures of several members, including CRABP I and CRABP II, have been reported (Kleywegt et al., 1994; Thompson et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998). These structures revealed the nature of the cavity occupied by the retinoids. The orientation of the polar head group of the ligand within the protein groups is determined by a few speci®c polar interactions in the interior of the cavity. Thus, in spite of the overall structural similarity and sequence homology, retinoid-binding proteins are capable of distinguishing between different retinoids with a high degree of speci®city (Ong & MacDonald, 1987; Levin et al., 1988; Á Giguere et al., 1990; Fiorella et al., 1993). The structural basis of this recognition was proposed by Jones et al. (1988). The strong anticarcinogenic activity of the synthetic retinoids and their varying speci®city, toxicity and stability compared with their naturally occurring counterparts make them important in medical research. A considerable amount of data has been accumulated on the binding of these synthetic compounds to various retinoid-binding proteins and nuclear receptors. Many of the synthetic retinoids are reported to have similar or even higher biological activity and lower toxicity than their natural counterparts. An in-depth understanding of the details of their binding to the cellular carrier proteins is therefore of interest for drug design.

Here, we present the crystal structures of human CRABP II Ê in complex with two synthetic retinoids, Ro13-6307 at 2.0 A Ê resolution, and of bovine CRABP I in and Ro12-7310 at 2.1 A Ê complex with a synthetic retinobenzoic acid, Am80, at 2.8 A resolution. Ro13-6307 is an unselective agonist of RAR with potential application in dermatology and oncology (Apfel et al., 1992). Ro12-7310 is an inactive metabolite of etretinate (tigason), a drug for the treatment of psoriasis (Peck & DiGiovanna, 1994). A number of retinobenzoic acids, including Am80, Am580 and TTNPB (Kagechika et al., 1988), have been used in dermatology and oncology. Am80 is a selective agonist of RAR- and has been tested in clinical trials of cancer patients with advanced acute promyelocytic leukemia (Tobita et al., 1997). These crystal structures provide important information about CRABP±drug interactions.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Expression, puri®cation and binding studies of CRABP I and II

Expression and puri®cation of recombinant CRABP I and II have been described by Bergfors et al. (1994). For the binding studies, puri®ed protein was diluted in the binding buffer (10 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.0, 1.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 0.8 M KCl, 10 mg mlÀ1 aprotinin, 10 mg mlÀ1 leupeptin, 3 mg mlÀ1 -globulin) and used in competition binding experiments. Extracts were incubated on ice for 3 h with 3H-labelled all-trans retinoic acid (5 nM) in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of unlabelled ligand. Complexed protein was separated from ligand-free protein using a NAP-5 desalting column (Pharmacia, Sweden) and the radioactivity was determined by liquid-scintillation counting. IC50 values were calculated from competition binding curves from at least three independent experiments (Table 1).
2.2. Crystallization

All crystallization trials were carried out using the hangingdrop vapour-diffusion method (McPherson, 1982). 2.2.1. Preparation of CRABP±retinoid complexes. The CRABP I±Am80 complex was prepared as described by Bergfors et al. (1994). Ro12-7310 and Ro13-6307 were solubilized in DMSO and added in molar excess to the concentrated solution of recombinant human CRABP II in the dark. The complex was ®ltered through a 0.2 mm ®lter (Anapore, Whatman) prior to crystallization experiments. 2.2.2. CRABP II±Ro13-6307. The crystallization drop contained 2 ml of the protein (24.6 mg mlÀ1) in 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.0 and 2 ml of reservoir solution. The reservoir solution contained 20% monomethyl PEG 5000 and 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5. Crystals were grown in the dark at room temperature. 2.2.3. CRABP II±Ro12-7310. The crystallization drop contained 2 ml of the protein (25 mg mlÀ1) in 20 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.0 and 2 ml of reservoir solution. The drop was equilibrated against 20% monomethyl PEG 5000, 0.2 M Tris±HCl

Between re®nement cycles, models were rebuilt in O (Jones et al., 1991). A test set of about 8% of the data was kept aside to monitor È the free R factor during the course of re®nement (Brunger, 1992). Ligand density was clearly visible in all the complexes. Dictionaries for all three ligand molecules were generated using XPLO2D (Kleywegt & Jones, 1997). Since coordinates for Ro13-6307 and Am80 were unavailable, standard geometry was imposed during re®nement. Coordinates of tigason (H.

Quality of the ®nal models are quite similar to each other, except for Am80, whose binding is slightly weaker. Details of the re®nement and model statistics are listed in Table 3. Ramachandran plots (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) look satisfactory for all three structures with less than 3% outliers, most of which lie close to allowed regions (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996). The only exception is Asp126, but this residue is also an outlier in the CRABP±RA complexes and has good density. All ®gures (except Fig. 3) were prepared using O and OPLOT (M. Kjeldgaard, unpublished program). VOIDOO (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994b) and ASA (Lee & Richards, 1971) were used for cavity and accessible surfacearea calculations, respectively.
3.2. Human CRABP II complex with Ro13-6307

All the cavity-lining residues in the CRABP II±Ro13-6307 complex are identical in conformation to those in the CRABP II±RA complex, except for Arg59. Ro13-6307 contains an aromatic ring fused to the -ionone ring (Fig. 3b) and Arg59 forms a charge/%-cloud interaction with this aromatic ring (Fig. 4). This residue also forms a hydrogen bond with a mainchain carbonyl O atom (Val76), which helps to anchor its

3.3. Human CRABP II in complex with Ro12-7310

In the structures of CRABP I and II bound to RA, the -ionone moiety of RA is stacked between the N-terminal of the II helix and the C±D turn in the open cavity mouth (Kleywegt et al., 1994). In Ro12-7310, the -ionone ring of RA is replaced by a planar aromatic ring (Fig. 3c). This aromatic ring plane is tilted by $60 out of the isoprenoid plane (torsion angle C5ÐC6ÐC7ÐC8 = À56 ), thus mimicking the structure of the -ionone ring of RA in its complex with CRABPs (Fig. 5). The environment near the cavity mouth is essentially identical to that in the RA-bound form, except that helix II is slightly shifted compared with the RA and Ro13-6307 complexes (for residues 23±35, the r.m.s.d. on C Ê atoms is 0.6 A between the Ro12-7310 and RA complexes; Fig. 5). The side chain of residue Leu28, in particular, has moved into the cavity in the Ro12-7310 complex, ®lling up the Ê empty space. This residue buries 45 A2 of accessible surface Ê area (calculated using ASA with a 1.4 A probe radius) upon Ê complexation, which is approximately 15 A2 more than its buried surface area in the RA and Ro13-6307 complexes. The hydroxyl group attached to the aromatic ring of the ligand lies outside the cavity and interacts with an external water molecule.

isoprenoid tail of RA, Am80 has two rigid benzene rings joined by a carboxamide link. In the crystal structure, we observed that the two benzene rings of Am80 are trans to each other. The guanidium group of Arg131 (132 in CRABP II) is close to the aromatic ring of the benzoic acid moiety of Am80 and to Phe15, forming a weak charge/%-cloud interaction with both. Arg131, together with Tyr133 (134 in CRABP II) and Arg111 (the Arg-Tyr-Arg triad), makes the usual hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group of Am80. A buried water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with the side-chain amino group of Arg59, the carbonyl O atom of

Human CRABP I and bovine CRABP I differ by only one residue, Ala80 (human) versus Pro80 (bovine), both of which are distant from the binding site. Binding studies have shown a weaker binding af®nity for Am80 (Fig. 3d) compared with RA for human CRABP I (Table 1) and it is safe to assume that the same is true for the bovine protein.

Senn, unpublished data), presumably owing to their kinked conformation.

However, the binding strength of Ro13-6307 is not very different from that of RA (Table 1). Unlike in the Ro13-6307 complex, the guanidium group of the Arg59 side chain in the Am80 complex does not have any interactions with the alkyl-substituted benzene ring of Am80.

The strong ion-pair interaction may prevent the Arg59 side chain from reorienting itself. Arg59 is also involved in a water-mediated interaction with the polar groups of Am80. In all these structures, the non-polar side-chain atoms of Arg59 are part of the surface that covers the ligand. In both the Ro13-6307 complex and the Am80 complex, this residue loses Ê $50 A2 surface area upon complexation, Ê which is at least 10 A2 more than in other CRABP I and II complexes. This is probably because of the presence of an aromatic ring fused to the -ionone ring.

The interaction of Am80 with CRABP I (yellow C atoms; red O atoms; blue N atoms). ' A-weighted simulated-annealing omit density for the ligand (Read, 1986; Hodel et al., 1992) is shown. Hydrogen-bonding interactions are indicated by dashed lines.

stabilized by water-mediated interactions. The hydrogenbonding capacity of the carbonyl group is not satis®ed. TTNPB, which is identical to Am80 (Fig. 3e) except that the central polar group is replaced by a ÐC(CH3) CHÐ group, forms a stronger complex with CRABPs (Table 1). This indicates that the polar moiety in the region of the cavity surrounded by many hydrophobic residues makes a signi®cant contribution to the weakening of the complexation. The diverse biological functions of naturally occurring retinoids (RA and 9-cis retinoic acid) and concomitant undesired side effects make them less suitable as drugs. Synthetic retinoids with a desired level of speci®city can be used to narrow down the range of retinoid activity and associated side effects. Crystal structures of cellular retinoidbinding proteins with and without various synthetic retinoids provide clues about their ¯exibility in accommodating structurally varied retinoids. This is fundamentally important for low-solubility drug traf®cking, which might be useful for new drug design.
