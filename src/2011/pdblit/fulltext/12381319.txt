Di-p-azido-bis[azido(2-aminopyridine)aquo]dicopper(H), (Cu(2-ampy)(N3)2(HzO)]~, was synthesized and characterized by X-ray crys~allogr~hy. The crystals are triclinic, space group PI, with a = 7.142(I), b= %812(l), c= 9.727(l) & o= 96,52(l), p= 92.52(l), y= 113.47(l)`, and Z = I. The structure was refined to RF = 0.030 for 1960 observed MoKa diffractometer data. The dimeric molecule, which possesses a crystallographic inversion center, contains both terminal and p(l)-bridging azido groups. Each copper(H) atom is further coordinated by a 2-aminopyridine ligand (via its ring N atom) and a water molecule to give a distorted square pyramid, with the metal atom raised by 0.17 A above the N4 basal plane (Cu-N (ring) = 2.001(2), Cu-N (azide) =1.962(3)-2.018(2) A] towards the apical aquo ligand (Cu-0 = 2.371(2) &). Each water molecule forms an intramolecular O***H-N (amine) acceptor hydrogen bond, and is linked by two 0-H. * *N (terminal azide) intermolecular donor hydrogen bonds to adjacent dimeric complexes to yield a layer structure parallel to (001). Infrared and electronic spectral data are presented and discussed.

pyridines, rather than pyridine itself, with copper(I1) azide might lead to a modification of the bonding mode of the bridging azide ligand in the resulting complexes. During the course of our investigation of metal azide complexes containing various substituted pyridine ligands [6, 71, we isolated a 1: 1 complex of copper(I1) azide with 2-aminopyridine (hereafter abbreviated as 2-ampy) which crystallizes with an additional water molecule. We determined its structure by spectroscopic and X-ray methods, in order to elucidate the details of molecular and coordination geometry and to appraise the steric effect of the organic ligand on the mode of the azide bridging.

Experimental Preparation of [Cu(2-ampy)(N&(HzO)]~, I To CuS04.5Hz0 (2 mmol) in 30 ml of water was added 2-ampy (from BDH, 4 mmol) dissolved in boiled ethanol (10 ml). Upon slow addition of NaNa (4 mmol) dissolved in a minimum of distilled water, a greenish-brown colloidal precipitate was formed immediately. The mixture was then stirred for 30 min. Well-formed black crystals of I, together with a greenish powder*, were isolated by allowing the final mixture to stand for several weeks. Elemental Analysis and Spectral Measurements Micro-analyses of C, H, and N were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240 Elemental Analyser. Copper was determined by titration against disodium EDTA after decomposition of the complex by boiling with mixtures of concentrated HNOs and HCl and evaporation several times. Elemental analysis results (%) for the crystalline product of empirical formula C,HsNaOCn were as follows, with calculated values in parentheses: C 23.85(23.13); H 3.17(3.10); N 43.20(43.14); Cu 24.73(24.45).

Introduction The factors influencing the mode of bridging in binuclear MZ(N3)2 systems, that is, whether the azide groups function as one-end bridges forming a fourmembered ring or as end-to-end bridges forming an eitht-membered ring, are not fully understood [l]. For instance, X-ray structural determinations have shown that while di-&1,3)-azido bridging of the latter type exists in Cd(py)2(N3)2 [2], the two azide groups are crystallographically distinct with different structural environments in Cu(py)a(Na)a [3]. In the copper(I1) complex, one azide ligand is monocoordinate whereas the other coordinates asymmetrically to three different metal centers. As the copper(I1) ion forms coordination compounds of a rich variety of stereochemistries [4,5], it would seem that the reaction of o-substituted 0020-1693/84/$3.00

Infrared spectra in the region 4000-200 cm-' were recorded on a Unicam SP 2000 spectrophotometer. Solid samples were measured as Nujol mulls and the liquid 2-ampy ligand as a capillary film. Reflectance spectra of solid complexes were measured over the 220-1000 nm range on a Zeiss-Jena VSU-1 instrument with MgO as a standard and diluent . X-Ray Crystallography A single crystal of approximate dimensions 0.36 X 0.28 X 0.12 mm was centered on a Nicolet R3m four-circle diffractometer system. Accurate unit-cell dimensions were obtained from least-squares refinement of the 28 values of 24 strong reflections with non-zero diffraction indices and x angles within the range 90 (or 270) +30°. Data collection and reduction were conducted using established procedures [8], and pertinent crystallographic information are summarized in Table I. _ Intensity statistics strongly favored space group Pl, and the structure was solved by direct phase determination based on negative quartets [9]. All fifteen non-hydrogen atoms in the asymmetric unit were located from the best E-map. After several cycles of blocked-cascade [lo] least-squares refmement, the four aromatic H atoms were geometrically

generated (C-H bond fixed at 0.96 A), assigned isotropic thermal parameters, and allowed to ride on their respective parent C atoms. At RF = 0.039, a difference Fourier map clearly revealed the positions of the remaining amine and water protons. These four H atoms were assigned fixed isotropic temperature factors and included in the final leastsquares cycles, which converged to the RF and R,, indices shown in Table I. The final difference map was essentially flat, with residual extrema lying between 0.54 and -0.71 eK3. All computations were performed on a Data General Corporation Nova 3/ 12 minicomputer with the SHELXTL program package [l I]. Analytical expressions of neutral atom scattering factors were employed, and anomalous dispersion corrections were incorporated [ 121. The final positional and thermal parameters for the non-hydrogen atoms are listed in Table II; atom labelling follows that shown in Fig. 1. Hydrogen coordinates are given in Table III, and bond distances and angles in Table IV. A table of structure factors is available on request from the second author. Discussion Molecular Structure and Crystal Packing Dimeric mole_cules of I, which has crystallographically imposed 1 symmetry, contain both terminal and p(l)-bridging azido groups (Fig. 1). Each metal centre is further coordinated by a 2-ampy ligand via its ring N(1) atom and a water molecule. The stereochemistry about each Cu(I1) atom is best described as a distorted square pyramid, with the water molecule at its apex and the metal atom raised by 0.17 A above the N4 basal plane. Atoms N(4), N(5), and N(6) all lie within 0.22 A of the central Cu2N2 ring. In conformity to the general trend for coordinated azides [l], both azido ligands in I are very nearly linear and asymmetric, the shorter N-N bonds being more remote from the metal atoms. Comparison of their measured dimensions (Table IV) show that the asymmetry is greater in the case of n(l)bridging.

the E.c(l)bridging azides. Despite the differences in charge and sub-units in these two dimeric Cu(I1) complexes, there is remarkably good agreement between corresponding bond distances and bond angles in the azido groups and the central Cu2N2 ring. The relevant dimensions reported for 2: Cu-N.

(bridging) = 2.0 18( 1) A, Cu-N (terminal) = 1.979(2) A, Cu-N-Cu' = 103.7(l)", N-N = 1.201(3) and 1.141(4) A for bridging azide, N-N= 1.118.8(2) and 1.150(2) A for terminal azide, and CU-N-N = 128.2(l)" for terminal azide may be compared with those of 1 listed in Table IV. All C and N atoms of the organic ligand are coplanar (within experimental error) and most of the measured dimensions closely match those reported for uncomplexed 2-ampy [ 141. A notable difference is that the bond configuration about N(2) in 1 is distinctly pyramidal, and the NH2 group makes a dihedral angle of 33" with the pyridine ring, as opposed to an angle of 15" for the sp2-hydbridized amino group in 2-ampy. This is mainly caused by the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond [N(2)-H***O = 2.852(6) A], and the geometrical requirement is such that the N(l)-C( 1)-C(2) angle is enlarged relative to the corresponding angle in free 2-ampy, so that the Cu-0 bond leans away from the organic ligand. The water molecule plays a unique role in dictating the structure of the present complex. Besides serving as a ligand and forming an acceptor intramolecular hydrogen bond with the amino group, it is further involved in intermolecular donor hydrogen bonding [O-H.**N(8)" = 2.901(7), O-H*-* N(6)"' = 2.878(6) A] with different terminal azido groups of two adjacent dimeric complexes. In the crystal structure (Fig. 2) the dimeric molecules are thus linked by 0-H. * *N hydrogen bonds to form layers parallel to (OOl), with only weak van der Waals interaction between the stacked layers. Full utilization of the lone pairs and protons of the water molecule in coordinate and hydrogen bonding also accounts for the fact that the Cu-0 bond of 2.371-

Electronic Spectrum The electronic spectrum of the solid complex exhibits the d-d transition band with a maximum around 14,490 cm-' accompanied by a distinct absorption at 18,860 cm-' (Fig. 3). The former value corresponds very closely to that usually found for five-coordinate copper(I1) complexes [22, 231. The electronic spectra of a series of monoamine adducts of bisethylenediamine-copper(I1) complexes show an intense band above 17,000 cm-' with a shoulder on the low frequency side, considered by Tomlinson and Hathaway [24] as being consistent with fivecoordinate stereochemistry. Kohout et al. [2.5] has reported that the electronic spectra of cyanatocopper(I1) complexes derived from some imidazole ligands exhibit d-d transitions as an intense band around 14,000-l 5,000 cm-' accompanied by a high wavenumber shoulder above 17.000 cm-`. They suggested either five-coordinate or rhombic octahedral geometry, in line with those found for a series of mono(diethylenetriamine)copper(II) complexes [26] exhibiting similar spectra.
