The high affinity binding of the anthrax protective antigen (PA) to one of its receptors, capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2), is essential for the intoxication process of anthrax toxin. To acquire novel research tools to study the PA­CMG2 interaction, we generated several anti-CMG2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). We demonstrated that one of the MAbs, 4B5, could inhibit PA­CMG2 binding and could also protect the sensitive cells against an anthrax lethal toxin challenge. We identified the epitope recognized by 4B5 and confirmed that the key residues of the epitope were the residues 119YI­LK125 of CMG2. Based on our results, we propose that 4B5 binds to the E122 pocket of CMG2 and interrupts the interaction between the pocket and the PA 2b3­2b4 loop. To our knowledge, this is the first report to illustrate that an anti-CMG2 antibody could inhibit the PA­CMG2 interaction and therefore interfere with the intoxication of anthrax toxin.

Introduction Anthrax toxin is a major virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis. The toxin consists of three protein subunits: protective antigen (PA), the receptor-binding subunit; lethal factor (LF), a metalloprotease that cleaves and inactivates certain members of the MAPKK family of intracellular signaling proteins; and edema factor (EF), a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that increases the cAMP concentration in eukaryotic cells [1,2]. PA binds to either of the two homologous cellular membrane receptors, tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) or capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2), and is digested by a furin-like protease of the host cell into two distinct fragments, PA20 and PA63. The PA63 fragment subsequently heptamerizes to form a receptor-bound prepore that binds both the LF and EF. The toxin­receptor complex is then internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and trafficked to a low-pH endosome, where acidic conditions induce the conversion of the prepore to a pore. After the conversion, EF and LF are transferred into the cytosol through the pore. Both CMG2 and TEM8 contain a signal peptide, an extracellular von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, a single-pass transmembrane region, and a cytosolic tail [3,4]. They share 40% overall ami-

no acid identity with each other, with 60% identity within their respective VWA domains. The VWA domains of CMG2 and TEM8 contain a conserved metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif (DxSxS. . .T. . .D, where x can be any amino acid). This is the domain that has direct contact with the PA. Despite strong amino acid sequence homology between CMG2 and TEM8, there are striking differences in the PA binding activities of the two proteins. The CMG2 VWA domain­PA interaction has very high affinity (KD = 170 pM), while the TEM8 VWA domain­PA interaction has a much lower binding affinity (KD = 130 nM) [5]. The high binding affinity between CMG2 and PA may be due to the fact that their interaction buries approximately 2000 Å2 of protein surface based on the crystal structure of the PA­CMG2 complex, of which the CMG2 to PA domain 4 interaction accounts for approximately 1300 Å2, and the CMG2 to PA domain 2 interaction accounts for approximately 600 Å2 [6,7]. The majority of published studies characterizing the PA­CMG2 interaction have been based on structure-based mutagenesis by the induction of amino acid mutations to either PA or CMG2 [8­10]. To acquire novel research tools to study the PA­CMG2 interaction, we generated several anti-CMG2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). We found that one of the MAbs, 4B5, had the ability to inhibit PA­CMG2 binding and could also protect the sensitive cells against an anthrax lethal toxin challenge. Next, we identified the epitope recognized by 4B5 and confirmed that the key residues of the epitope were residues 119YI­LK125 of CMG2. Based on our results, we propose that 4B5 binds to the E122 pocket of CMG2 and interrupts the interaction between the pocket and the PA 2b3­2b4 loop.

Materials and methods Preparation of proteins. The gene corresponding to the VWA domain of CMG2 or TEM8 was cloned into a pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) and was expressed in Escherichia coli M15. The proteins represent CMG2 residues 40­217 (CMG240­217) and TEM8 residues 38­223 (TEM838­223), respectively. The gene corresponding to the whole extracellular portion of CMG2 or TEM8 was cloned into a pPICZa A vector (Invitrogen) and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The proteins represent CMG2 residues 34­316 (CMG2-EP) and TEM8 residues 34­317 (TEM8-EP), respectively. The recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni-chelating column (GE Healthcare) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The inverse PCR based on the expression plasmid of CMG240­217 was performed to construct three fragments of CMG2 (CMG240­133, CMG240­159 and CMG240­186), a seven-amino acid deletion (119YIHEGLK125) of CMG240­217 (CMG2-d7), and a mutant in which the residues from Y119 to L126 of CMG240­217 were replaced with the corresponding residues of TEM8 (CMG2-mT). The inverse PCR based on the expression plasmid of TEM838­223 was performed to construct a mutant in which the corresponding residues of TEM8 were replaced with the residues from Y119 to L126 of CMG240­217 (TEM8-mC). The proteins were expressed in E. coli M15. Production of monoclonal antibodies. Anti-CMG2 MAbs were prepared according to the standard hybridoma technique. Spleen cells from BALB/c mouse immunized with CMG2-EP were fused with mouse myeloma cells (SP2/0). Hybridoma clones were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Positive hybridomas were developed to get stable cell lines. Ascites from each hybridoma were produced in mice and monoclonal antibodies were purified by Protein G chromatography (GE Healthcare). The MAbs obtained were then characterized for antibody subclass using an ImmunoTypeTM Kit (Sigma) and their specificity were analyzed by ELISA and Western blot analysis. Western blot. Electrophoresis was performed in 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels and the recombinant proteins were detected by Western blotting using an anti-His tag MAb (Sigma) or an antiCMG2 mAb. Briefly, the transferred PVDF membrane was blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in TBS for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed thrice with TBST (TBS-0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), then the membrane was incubated with either a 1:2000 dilution of anti-His tag MAb or 0.5 lg/ml of an anti-CMG2 MAb in a 0.2% BSA­TBST solution for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed four times with TBST. Protein bands were probed with 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) and washed four times as described above. Chemiluminescence was applied as instructed by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz). ELISA. ELISA plates (96-well) were coated with 200 ng/well of CMG240­217 or TEM8-EP in coating buffer (50 mM Na2CO3­NaHCO3, pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C. After thrice washed with PBST (PBS-0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), the plates were blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Binding of the anti-CMG2 MAbs with the coated antigens was monitored using 2- or 3-fold dilution series. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and washed four times with PBST. Then, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz) was added into each well in a 1:10,000 dilution, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed four times and developed with TMB solution in the dark place for 5 min, and the enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 2 M H2SO4 and the OD450 of the plates was read using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). For the inhibition assay, CMG240­217 was adsorbed onto wells of a 96-well plate. PA (0.5 lg/ml) plus different concentration of anti-

CMG2 MAbs was then added to the CMG240­217 coated wells in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2, followed by sequential addition of anti-PA MAb 4B2 [11], HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, and enzyme substrate at appropriate time intervals as above. In vitro intoxication assay. In vitro intoxication experiments were performed with a modified protocol described before [12]. Briefly, Murine macrophage-like J774A.1 cells were grown to confluence in wells of a 96-well plate. Then aliquots of 100 ll of medium containing PA (20 ng/ml), LF (10 ng/ml) and various concentrations of anti-CMG2 MAbs were added to the cells. After 3-h incubation at 37 °C, cell viability was assessed by MTT staining. Epitope mapping. The PhD-12TM Phage Display Peptide Library Kit (New England Biolabs) was used to map the epitope of MAb 4B5 with a protocol described before [11]. The biopanning procedure was repeated three times. Phage clones selected from the third round of panning were amplified and purified for competition experiments [11] in which the CMG240­133 was used to compete with phage clones to bind to the 4B5 coated on the ELISA plates. The percentage that CMG240­133 blocked the binding of the 4B5 and the phage clones by the following formula: % blocking = (1Àtest well A450/control well A450) Â 100. The phage clones with the highest blocking percentage in the competition experiments were amplified and purified to sequence the inserts. Results and discussion Production and characterization of anti-CMG2 monoclonal antibodies Three anti-CMG2 MAbs (4B5, 4G3 and 2G4) were generated using the cell fusion technique with recombinant CMG2-EP as the immunogen. All three MAbs were IgG1. Antibodies 4B5 and 4G3 could bind to CMG2-EP and to CMG240­217 but could not bind to the TEM8 proteins, as illustrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). These results indicated that these two antibodies could specifically recognize the VWA domain of CMG2 in spite of the fact that the VWA domains of CMG2 and TEM8 share a 60% amino acid identity. Antibody 2G4 could bind to both CMG2-EP and TEM8-EP but could not bind to CMG240­217 and TEM838­223, meaning that it could bind both receptor proteins, although its epitope was not in the VWA domain. The ELISA test confirmed that 4B5 and 4G3 could bind to CMG240­217 (Fig. 1B), while only 2G4 could bind to TEM8EP (Fig. 1C). MAb 4B5 inhibited PA-CMG2 binding in both ELISA and cellular intoxication tests Given that CMG2 binds PA at a very high affinity and that the PA­CMG2 interaction buries a large protein surface ($2000 Å2) by crystal structure analysis, we hypothesized that the antiCMG2 MAbs might interfere with PA­CMG2 binding. To address this issue, we used anti-CMG2 MAbs to compete with the PA­ CMG2 binding in an ELISA test. We found that 4B5 and 4G3 could inhibit PA­CMG2 binding in a dose-dependent manner, but 2G4 did not show any obvious inhibition (Fig. 2A). PA­CMG2 binding is the key step for the intoxication process of the anthrax toxin. To determine whether 4B5 and 4G4 also influence the toxicity of anthrax toxin, we then tested their respective capacities to inhibit anthrax lethal toxin (PA plus LF)-induced cytotoxicity in J774.1A cells. A concentration equal to or greater than 25 lg/ml of 4B5 showed a significant protection against the toxin, while the other two MAbs did not show a significant protection (Fig. 2B). Although the concentration of 4B5 needed to obtain the protection was high compared to some anti-PA antibodies or other toxin inhibitors [13­15], the result was nevertheless promising. To our knowledge, this is the first report to illustrate that an anti-

Fig. 1. Characterization of anti-CMG2 monoclonal antibodies. Anti-CMG2 MAbs were characterized by Western blot analysis (A) with different CMG2 and TEM8 proteins, and by ELISA tests with CMG240­217 (B) or TEM8-EP (C) as the coated antigen respectively. MAbs 4B5 and 4G3 could only bind to two CMG2 proteins, while 2G4 could bind to both CMG2-EP and TEM8-EP. MAb 2G4 could not bind to CMG240­217 meant its epitope was not in the VWA dormain. The bands of CMG2-EP and TEM8-EP in SDS­PAGE were not clear due to the protein glycosylation in Pichia pastoris expression system.

CMG2 antibody could inhibit the PA­CMG2 interaction and therefore interfere with the intoxication of anthrax toxin. The epitope of 4B5 was mapped to residues Y119­K125 of the CMG2 protein To explore the mechanism of the toxin-inhibition activity of 4B5, we attempted to identify the epitope of the antibody. In our initial studies, we expressed different lengths of CMG2 fragments and found that 4B5 could bind to all of the fragments tested (first three lanes of Fig. 3A and B), which meant that its epitope was in the residues 40­133 of CMG2. We next used the phage display technique to further map the location of the epitope. After three rounds of biopanning with a PhD-12TM Library, 30 clones were selected to confirm their binding to 4B5 by ELISA, and 11 clones with the highest binding were further compared by competition ELISA using CMG240­217 as the competitor. Eight clones with a blocking percent over 50% were

sequenced at the vector inserts. As shown in Fig. 3D, from the sequenced inserts we found a four-amino acid consensus, YI­LK, that was identical to several residues between Y119 and K125 (YIHEGLK) of CMG2. There were several variable residues for the consensus, where the residues L and K were more conservative (in 7/8 phage clones), while Y and I were replaceable, suggesting that L124 and K125 might be the most critical residues of the epitope. To further confirm the epitope, we generated two CMG2 mutants based on CMG240­217. CMG2-d7 harbored a seven-amino acid deletion (Y119­K125) of CMG240­217, and CMG2-mT was a mutant in which the residues from Y119 to L126 of CMG240­217 were replaced with the corresponding residues of TEM8 (YMHEGFER). We also generated a TEM8 mutant (TEM8-mC) in which the corresponding residues of TEM838­223 were replaced with the Y119­ L126 residues of CMG2. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, 4B5 could bind to the wild-type CMG240­217 but could not bind to CMG2-d7 or CMG2-mT. The intriguing result was that 4B5 could also bind to TEM8-mC but not to TEM838­223, which confirmed that 4B5 could

Fig. 4. The epitope of 4B5 overlaps the main residues of E122 pocket of CMG2. Part of the crystal structure of the PA­CMG2 complex [7] was shown. Both PA domain 2 (PA D2) and PA domain 4 (PA D4) interacts with the VWA domain of CMG2. R344 of PA 2b3­2b4 loop forms a salt bridge with E122 of CMG2.

binding interrupts the interaction between the pocket and the PA 2b3­2b4 loop. Based on our results, we posit that the 4B5 inhibition data provides supplementary evidence that the E122 pocket of CMG2 is involved in the PA­CMG2 interaction. In conclusion, the anti-CMG2 MAbs in this study may have a significant value in characterizing the anthrax toxin receptors and thus may help in the understanding of the pathogenesis of anthrax toxin. Our data also suggests that an anti-CMG2 MAb such as 4B5 may have potential as a therapeutic agent against anthrax infection. Acknowledgments

distinguish CMG2 and TEM8. All of these results clearly suggest that 4B5 binds to residues Y119 through L126 of CMG2 with 119 YI­LK125 as the key amino acids of the epitope. 4B5 may influence the binding between the CMG2 E122 pocket and the PA 2b3­2b4 loop The crystal structures of the PA and CMG2 complex revealed that in addition to the binding of PA domain 4 to the MIDAS region of CMG2, there is also an interaction between the 2b3­2b4 loop of PA domain 2 and the CMG2 pocket (E122 pocket) adjacent to the MIDAS motif [6,7]. The E122 pocket is formed by several residues that are conserved in TEM8, including Y119, H121, E122 and Y158. Residues Y119 and Y158 along with CMG2 b4-a4 form the sides of the pocket, and residues H121 and E122 form its base [10]. PA residue R344 is located at the tip of the 2b3­2b4 loop and buried within the interface. This residue has been shown to form a salt bridge with residue E122 of CMG2. Disruption of the salt bridge between residues R344 of PA and E122 of CMG2 decreases the affinity of PA for CMG2. Additionally, CMG2 residue Y119 plays a role in enhancing the binding of the E122 pocket to the PA 2b3­2b4 loop [10]. Given that the epitope of 4B5 overlaps the main residues of the E122 pocket (Y119, H121 and E122) (Fig. 4), we propose that 4B5
