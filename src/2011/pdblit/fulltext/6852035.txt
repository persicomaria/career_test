The crystal structure of bovine erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase has been refined by a combined procedure of restrained crystallographic refinement and energy minimization at 0.20 nm resolution. The final R value at this resolution is 0.178. The r.m.s. deviation of main-chain atoms of the two independently refined monomers is 0.019 nm. The structure at 0.28 nm resolution, which has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement, served as a starting model. The refined model allowed a detailed survey of the hydrogen-bonding pattern and of the subunit contact areas in the molecule. The model contains 165 solvent molecules per dimer, all taken as water molecules. The mobility of the structure was derived from the individual atomic temperature factors. The complete tetramer, including the active sites, seems to be rather rigid, except for narrow loops near to the N-terminal ends and some p turns exposed to solvent. The active centres of glutathione peroxidase are found in flat depressions on the molecular surface. The catalytically active selenocysteine residues could be located at the N-terminal ends of a helices forming /YG$ substructures together with two adjacent parallel p strands. In the vicinity of the reactive group some aromatic amino acid side-chains could be localized. Especially Trp-148, which could be hydrogen bonded to SeCys-35, may play a functional role during catalysis. The results ofsubstrate and inhibitor binding studies in solution and in the crystalline state could be interpreted by an apparent half-site reactivity of glutathione peroxidase. The enzyme seems to react in the sense of negative cooperativity with dimers being the functional units. Based on difference Fourier analyses of appropriate derivatives a reasonable model of glutathione binding is presented. Among the residues which could be of functional importance are Arg-40, Gln-130 and Arg-167, presumably forming salt bridges and a hydrogen bond to the glutathione molecule. In conclusion, a general picture of a minimal reaction mechanism, which is in good agreement with functional and structural data, is proposed. The main reaction of the catalytic cycle presumably shuttles between the selenolate and the selenenic acid state of SeCys-35. The tetrameric selenoenzyme glutathione (GSH) peroxidase ( M , = 84000) catalyzes the reduction of a variety of hydroperoxides including lipid hydroperoxides and is believed to protect biomembranes and other essential cellular components against oxidative challenge [I - 31: ROOH heme enzymes, GSH peroxidase reduces almost every hydroperoxide with comparable rate, while dialkyl peroxides are not metabolized [8]. GSH peroxidase contains one selenocysteine per subunit. The selenocysteine residues are intimately involved in the catalytic process as shown by the following observations. a) Treatment of oxidized peroxidase with cyanide results in a loss of activity and release of selenium from the enzyme [9]. b) Iodoacetate selectively inhibits only the GSH-reduced enzyme and reacts with the selenocysteine residue [4,10]. c) A photoelectron spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the redox state of selenium in GSH peroxidase depends on the substrates present [Ill. d) The selenium sites of oxidized GSH peroxidase can be reduced in the crystalline state and show characteristic electron density changes in accord with the disappearance of seleniumbound oxygen atoms [12]. e) Recently it has been demonstrated that under oxidizing conditions a covalent complex between GSH and peroxidase, presumably E-Se-SG, can be formed via a selenosulfide linkage [I 31.

Glutathione serves as specific electron donor substrate and traces of alimentary selenium provide the prosthetic group, a selenocysteine residue [4,5]. As regards substrate specificity, GSH peroxidase sharply contrasts with the heme peroxidases. The selenoenzyme does not accept typical hydrogen donors of common peroxidases such as guajacol, benzidine etc. [6].The only physiological substrate which yields appreciable reaction rates is GSH, although the enzyme shows some reactivity with a variety of other thiol compounds [7].Also in contrast to the

have increased the resolution and accuracy of the molecular model of GSH peroxidase by extensive crystallographic refinement. Because of phase errors enzyme models obtained by the method of isomorphous replacement are only of limited quality. They must be improved in order to obtain sufficiently reliable results for the understanding of their biological function. Several approaches to obtain higher resolution and more accurate phase angles have been proposed, which have in common that they use the experimentally determined phases in an initial step and replace them by calculated phases in the following refinement steps. The GSH peroxidase structure could be refined successfully by applying a method of restrained crystallographic refinement, which includes reciprocal-space refinement and energy minimization of the structure [14]. Unfortunately, the amino acid sequence of the enzyme has not yet been determined by chemical methods. Although the crystallographic refinement is at a final stage, there is uncertainty in the identity of some residues, as the identification is based primarily on the shape of the electron density. In spite of this limitation, the improved enzyme model has led to new conclusions concerning the catalytic function of GSH peroxidase, which will be discussed in detail in this paper. Several aspects of the X-ray structure analysis, dealing mainly with experimental methods, have already been described and a molecular model of the GSH peroxidase structure, derived from an electron density map at 0.28 nm resolution, has been presented [ 121.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Glutathione peroxidase was prepared from bovine red blood cells according to [15]. Preparation of' Crystalline Derivatives Several chemically modified derivatives of the peroxidase have been produced in an attempt to mimic different functional states of the enzyme and to obtain a series of static pictures of the dynamic electron-transfer process. Structural analysis of these derivatives thus provides some information about the catalytic action of the enzyme; details of derivative preparation are given in Table 1.

5 m M phosphate buffer, p H 7.2 for 12 h; (b) dialysis against 5mM phosphate buffer, pH7.2, for 22h to remove the peroxide from the sample. The protein concentration, determined at L = 280 nm [17] after dialysis, was 6.75 mg/ml; 0.1 ml of the enzyme solution (8 nmol GSH peroxidase) was incubated with 0.020 ml (32 nmol GSH) of 1.6 mM [3H]GSH (specific radioactivity = 125.6 Ci/mol) for 3 h at 30°C and the mixture then applied to the column. The column effluent was collected in 0.1-ml fractions and 0.050-ml portions were measured for radioactivity in a Kontron MR300 liquidscintillation counter. The scintillation cocktail consisted of toluene/Triton X-100 (1 :2, v/v)/0.7 % PPO. For 3H, counting efficiencies between 40 - 50 "/, were obtained, determined by internal standardization with 3H standards of known radioactivity. GSH-binding experiments in the crystalline state were done by soaking a native (NATI) crystal of typical size in a solution consisting of 2.5 M phosphate buffer, p H 7.0 and 3.125 mM ['HIGSH (specific radioactivity = 107.45 Ci/mol). After prolonged air-oxidation of the system (>5weeks), when the solution was thiol-free as determined by the nitroprusside reaction, the crystal was extensively washed by three changes of 2.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, over a period of 36 h to remove non-covalently bound, labeled GSH. After the washing steps the crystal was dissolved in 15 ml toluene/Triton X-100 scintillation cocktail. Bound radioactivity was determined by liquidscintillation counting as described above. By internal standardization 23 500 dis./rnin were measured corresponding to ymol bound GSH. 9.85 x The protein content of the crystal could be determined by measurement of the crystal dimensions in a conventional WILD stereo microscope. In a typical experiment a crystal volume of 7.4 x l o p 3mm3 was calculated, which corresponds to 17.0 x pmol GSH peroxidase subunits ( M , = 21 000) per crystal. The influence of the cyclic peroxide 3,6-dihydroxy-3,6dimethyl-1 ,2-dioxane on the activity of bovine red-blood-cell GSH peroxidase (specific activity 320 Ujmg) was studied by the coupled test procedure [18]. The turnover rate was measured by replacing tert-butylhydroperoxide with 5 mM of the cyclic peroxide. I n an inhibition study 5 mM of the cyclic peroxide were added to the usual test concentration of tertbutylhydroperoxide. In a further experiment the inhibitory influence of peroxodisulphate was tested. GSH peroxidase was preincubated with 5 mM GSH in 100 niM phosphate buffer, p H 7.0, for 1 h then dialyzed against 2 mM peroxodisulphate in the same buffer overnight and the enzymatic activity determined by the coupled test.

instead of real-space refinement. This method derives the normal equations for a diagonal-matrix least-squares refinement from a difference Fourier map. The crystallographic F residual Z (I F,I - I ,1)' is then minimized together with the conformational energy of the model. The relative weights of crystallographic residual and conformational energy can be set through a scale factor. The value of this scale factor decides whether idealized model geometry is strictly kept or relaxed in favour of a smaller crystallographic residual. Energy parameters for bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles and nonbonded interactions were used as described elsewhere [22,23]. Difference Fourier maps were calculated with grid spacings of 0.07 nm. Usually the automated refinement reached a local minimum of crystallographic R value after about five cycles. In order to correct the model, Fourier maps mostly of the (2)F,I - IF,I) type, using calculated, combined [24] or Sim-weighted [25] phases were inspected in a Vector General graphics display system [26]. In the phase combination procedure, model phases calculated from the current models and multiple isomorphous replacement phases were given equal weights. Since the amino acid sequence is still unknown, the sequence had to be determined by interpretation of the electron density distribution. Surface accessibility and possible hydrogen bonding were taken as additional selection criteria. A computer program, based on the method of Lee and Richards [27] and written by M. Levitt [28], was used for these calculations. Between each series of automated refinement steps (five EREF cycles) the sequence was changed at several positions during inspection of Fourier maps in the graphics display system. Water molecules, introduced at later refinement stages, were found in difference Fourier maps. They were qualitatively checked with the display system to ensure that geometric requirements for hydrogen-bond formation were approximately met. Structure factors, R values, and electron density maps were calculated with the PROTEIN program system [29].

RESULTS A N D DISCUSSION Refinement A model on the basis of a tentative sequence, which agreed well with the amino acid composition [17], was built, adjusted to impose standard bonding geometry and refined by several cycles of real-space refinement [21] and Fourier map inspection in a graphics display system [26]. The R value for all data between 0.70 nm and 0.28 nm resolution dropped finally to 0.35 ( R = Z ~ ~ F o ~ - - ~ F , ~This Z ~ F 0 was . ~ / model ~ ) used as starting model for the refinement described in this paper. For further refinement the procedure EREF [I41 has been used extensively. The two crystallographically independent monomers were refined independently except that at each stage they had the same amino acid sequence. The cp and II, torsion angles of the main chain and torsion angles x1 -x4 of the side chains were set to about the same values in both monomers at the beginning of each refinement stage. The course of refinement is listed in Table 3. Fourier maps, usually with Fourier coefficients (21 F, I -IF,\) expicc, were inspected in the graphics display system to correct the model. Initially data were used from 0.50nm to 0.20 nm resolution applying a rejection ratio (21 F,- F, l/I F, + F,I) of 1.2. At later refinement stages data were used from 0.60nm to 0.20nm resolution. At each stage the tentative amino acid sequence was changed to varying degrees. To correct the large unfavourable energy term after a sequence replacement, the first EREF cycle was only energy minimization; i.e. the scale factor ( S ) , between crystallographic residual and conformational energy, was set to 0.0. The scale factor was raised in the next four EREF cycles in the same way to 12 x at each stage (from S = 3 x The energy values at the end of step 5 are listed in Table 3. The R value rose by 0.02 to 0.03 and dropped finally to the numbers given in Table 3. Stage 1 was the starting model obtained from the averaged 0.28-nm Fourier map. During stage 2 two cycles of EREF were

performed and the resolution was increased stepwise to 0.20 nm. From stage 2 to stage 8 manual changes to the model were performed mainly in external loops. In all calculations an overall temperature factor of 0.12nm2 was used. The configuration of external loops and Pturns was changed (the number of residues in the monomer varied from 175 to the final value of 182) and fitted to theelectron-density distribution. The Rvalue improved from stage to stage and dropped to 0.235. After stage 8 no manual correction of the polypeptide main chain was required. At stage 9 water molecules, identified in a difference Fourier map, were introduced for the first time. They were checked at the display system to see whether they approximately met the geometric requirements for hydrogen-bond formation. In subsequent refinement stages additional water molecules were introduced by the same criteria. From stage 9 to stage 15 the refinement consisted mainly of re-interpretation of the amino acid sequence as the Fourier map improved. During these stages difference Fourier maps with coefficients (1 F, I - IF, I) were calculated and plotted in order to

The overall temperature factor was replaced by two averaged temperature factors for each amino acid, one for main chain atoms and one for side-chain atoms. At stage10 the amino acids Cys-64 and Met-I01 were introduced. A difference Fourier map between the oxidized and the reduced enzyme (NATI-NAGS) showed a large positive residual at the selenocysteine site. To fit the excess density, the selenocysteine was replaced by a seleninic acid group, RSeOOH. The final R value is 0.186 for all reflections (25 186) from 0.60nm to 0.20nm resolution and 0.178 applying a rejection ratio (21 F, - F, //IF, F, I) of 1.2 (24798 reflections). The final difference Fourier map has no interpretable features.

Quality and Accuracy of the Model

As there are two chemically identical subunits in the asymmetric unit, a quantitative comparison provides an objective measure of the accuracy of the model : by application of the

non-crystallographic symmetry operation the refined coordinates of the main-chain atoms of monomer 1 were transformed into the corresponding positions of monomer 2. After least-squares refinement of the transformation parameters we have estimated a mean deviation of 0.019 nm in the positional parameters of the main-chain atoms, which represents an upper limit of error, as there may well be real differences between the subunits introduced by differences in the crystal environment. Bond lengths and bond angles of the refined model are very close to ideal values; the r.m.s. deviations are 0.0012 nm and 1.9 degrees respectively. The r.m.s. deviation of w - , and similar angles from minimum energy values is 6.6 degrees. For the torsion angles, which account for the planarity of aromatic rings, the r.m.s. deviation is 1.9 degrees. These deviations are strongly correlated with the scale factors used during refinement. The amino acid sequence was determined by fitting a polypeptide model optimally to the electron-density distribution and hence may be wrong at some positions. The aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr, Phe), the prolines, the cysteine and two methionines are likely to be correct, as they have a rather characteristic shape. Many of the other residues (Arg, Lys, Gln, Glu, Asn, Asp, Leu, Ile, Val, Thr, Ser), may be assigned with reasonable confidence when surface accessibility and hydrogen bonding can be taken as additional identifying criteria. The sequence on the basis of the 0.28-nm isomorphous Fourier map, given in a previous paper [12], was used to initiate the refinement process and was only tentative. It differs considerably from the sequence given in this paper. The amino acid sequence of the final model given in Table4 must still be regarded as an approximation, but this form of description, even if tentative, seems to be more informative than a shape classification. The proposed sequence is in good agreement with an amino acid analysis of bovine GSH peroxidase [17]. In addition the high resolution and the well-refined analysis provides confidence. The electron density is indeed very characteristic for many residues as shown in Fig. 1. The qualitative description of the monomer structure, given by Ladenstein et al. [12], remains valid and will be not repeated here in detail. For a schematic drawing of the secondary structure elements of a GSH peroxidase monomer see Fig. 2. Twelve clearly defined 0 turns of types I, 11,111and 111' [30] and three one-turn 3,, helices are recognized in the monomer

Ternprmture Factors aiid Main-Chain Flexibility
Several authors have commented recently on thc significance of atomic temperature factors (B = 8 n2( u ) ~(, u ) is the ~ mean square amplitude of isotropic harmonic displacement) in indicating the flexibility of certain parts of a protein molecule [31,32]. Molecular dynamics calculations on the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor showed structural fluctuations in the picosecond range, of a size roughly in agreement with the observed temperature factor [33]. Since data collection on protein crystals is a long-term process compared to the thermal vibration of atoms, the Bfactor does not differentiate between static and dynamic disorder. This is one of its limitations, another being the assumption that the motions of protein atoms are isotropic and harmonic. Fig. 3 shows a plot of the average Bfactor of the atoms N, CO, C", C, 0 against residue number of a GSH peroxidase monomer (monomer 1). Parts of the structure, especially some strands forming Psheets (PI, p2, p3, P4), two ofthe cc-helical structures (al, ccJ and certain parts of the chain involved in subunit contacts show significantly lower mean-square displacements than other parts without well-defined secondary structure elements. It is also evident that the mobility of the main chain in the central regions of the cc helices is lower than at the end. N-terminal and Cterminal residues show high Bvalues, indicating that these parts of the structure are relatively flexible and indeed appear ill-defined in the electron-density distribution. The highest

Bvalues can be found at the positions of a narrow loop (residues 13 - 15) near to the N-terminal end and some P turns (residues 54, 89, 106, 157). These residues are exposed to solvent and therefore are less constrained by packing effects. The chain segments around the active site (SeCys-35) are formed by a well-defined secondary structure element, a /jab structure. They are involved in hydrogen-bond interaction and exhibit relatively low mean-square displacements. The mainchain Bfactors of monomer 2 qualitatively show the same trends as the B factors of monomer 1, indicating little influence of crystal packing on the conformation of the molecule.
Suhuti it Contacts A rather flat, tetrahedral quaternary structure with point symmetry 222, approximating to a planar arrangement of the identical monomers, is a unique feature of the GSH peroxidase tetramer [12]. The contact regions are extensive along two of the mutually perpendicular twofold symmetry axes, a local axis relating the monomers of an asymmetric unit and a crystallographic axis producing the tetrameric structure from the dimer. The contact regions between the four monomers can be described in terms of the decrease of accessible surface area during transfer of surface atoms from the solvent to the protein interior. The surface area accessible to solvent is defined for given protein atoms as the area of a surface over which a water molecule can be placed so that it makes van der Waals contacts with these atoms without penetrating any other protein atoms [27]. In the contacts across the local twofold axis (dimer axis) 16 amino acid residues of each monomer are involved; both polar and apolar groups can be found among them. The amino acid residues together with their decrease of accessible surface areas when contacts are formed are listed in Table7. In addition to the hydrophobic contacts four hydrogen bonds can

This covered surface area occurs twice in the tetramer

be formed across the local axis by residues Glu-77, Arg-86 and the symmetry equivalent pair, Glu-277 and Arg-286 (see Table 8). The contact regions between the two dimers related by the crystallographic twofold axis (Table 7) consist of 80 amino acid residues. Hence 20 residues per monomer are involved in the contacts. Polar side-chains as well as main atoms contribute 36 hydrogen bonds in addition to the total number of contacts formed across the crystallographic twofold axis. Interestingly a considerable fraction of the main-chain contacts across the crystallographic twofold axis is formed by an antiparallel P-sheet-like structure. Each p strand consists of about four residues capable of forming main-chain hydrogen bonds to a strand provided by the symmetry-related monomer (residues forming these p-sheet-like structures are marked by an asterisk * in Table 8). A correlation established between surface area accessible to solvent and hydrophobic free energy [34] has been used to

suggest that the reduction of accessible surface area occurring upon subunit association is the main source of free energy ( A Gtransfer) stabilizing protein-protein interactions. Since commonly very few residues are involved in more than one interface the buried surface areas are, to a good approximation, additive [35]. For polar surfaces 4Gtranhfe, smaller but still of is comparable magnitude. Thus dGtranpfer is roughly proportional to the total area buried. Table 9 summarizes the results of these considerations on the association of GSH peroxidase monomers. N o contacts could be observed between subunits related by the third diad, which is generated by the crystallographic twofold and the local axis. In view of the similar magnitudes of the monomer contact areas buried on association, one would predict roughly identical values of the individual binding constants between the GSH peroxidase monomers.

During refinement 165 solvent molecules could be located in the GSH peroxidase dimer. Fig.4 shows a stereo representation of the solvent structure in a GSH peroxidase monomer. All solvent molecules have been taken as water molecules. They were introduced at relatively high electron density peaks Iin (I 5, 1 F, I) difference maps, occupying stereochemically reasonable positions. Another criterion was the temperature factor of the solvent molecule, since solvent molecules with high temperature factors ( B > 0.30 nm2) should still be regarded with some suspicion. Most of the water molecules are located on the molecular surface at similar positions in both monomers, some are visible only at monomer 1, others only at monomer 2. The distances of the water molecules forming hydrogen bonds to polar side-chains of the GSH peroxidase dimer are listed in Table 10. 23 water molecules are internal and hence are constituents of the structure. Five with B factors in the range 0.15 - 0.30 nm2 build u p a chain of solvent molecules across the local dimer axis (see Fig. 5 ) at a presumptive GSSG binding region on a PEP

Fig. 5. Schematic drawing of the water chain at apresumptive GSSG-binding region on the dimer interfuce. The water molecules would be displaced upon binding of GSSG molecules. Some side chains forming hydrogen bonds to the solvent molecules are shown

structure, where the carboxy ends of two parallel p strands (PI, f12) and helix a1 meet one another [36]. Our interpretation, based on analysis of several difference Fourier maps, suggests that this site on the dimer axis is involved in GSSG binding. The chain of water molecules would be displaced from the site upon binding of GSSG molecules.

These findings are analogous to the results from the refinement of several serine proteases [37]. The observation, that the solvent structure of free binding sites due to local charge effects mimics the presence of bound substrates or inhibitors, seems to provide almost supportative evidence for our interpretation too, favouring indeed the existence of a binding site which might be composed of the residues Gln-71, Gln-271 and the histidines His-81 and His-281 at the local twofold axis. A well-defined water structure is also found near the active site (SeCys-35). The water molecules involved show Bfactors in the range 0.15 -0.25 nm2, except one solvent molecule, W417, which is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain carbonyl group of Asn-149 and to a side-chain oxygen of the seleninic acid at position 35. This solvent molecule is characterized by a relatively low B value of 0.088 nm2; it and others (W411, W416, W429, W530, W563) would be displaced upon binding of GSH and reduction of the active site.

Bound water molecules are represented by grey spheres and the residues presumably involved in GSH binding (Arg-40, Arg-167, Gln-130) are marked with small lines

The Active Centres The catalytically active selenocysteine residue 35 is located at the N-terminal end of helix C I ~ ,which forms a PEP substructure together with the two adjacent parallel P strands (PI, p,), see Fig. 2. Similar arrangements of secondary structure are frequently observed at active regions ofenzymes that are folded ,' into CI and b structural elements. Braenden [36] has drawn attention to several functions often associated with this type of structure : fi.8 structures provide a geometrically favourable situation for the occurrence of a binding region near to the carboxy ends of two adjacent parallel /3 strands. Since the active site of GSH peroxidase can be localized in the general vicinity of SeCys-35, where the carboxy ends of two parallel p strands (PI, P2) and the N-terminal end of helix C I ~ one another, it meet is tempting to speculate that this arrangement is of unique importance for catalysis and that substrate binding (see below) may occur at this region. It has long been known that in the CI helix the alignment of the peptide dipoles parallel to the helix axis gives rise to a macrodipole of considerable strength. For points near to the helix N terminus the effect of the dipole is equivalent to the effect of half a positive unit charge [38]. Hence one could imagine that the electric field due to the dipole will stabilize the active-site selenolate and moment of helix C I ~ enhance its nucleophilic reactivity. The active sites of GSH peroxidase are found in flat depressions on the molecular surface and are readily accessible from solvent channels in the crystals. In a space-filling drawing of the tetrainer (see Fig. 6), no prominent clefts or crevices are visible at the active centres to suggest presumptive binding sites for substrates or the co-substrate. Exposure of the catalytically active selenocysteine residues at the molecular surface is consistent with the easy access of the substrates and thus the high reaction rates of GSH peroxidase. Some aromatic amino acid residues (Phe, Trp) are found in the vicinity of the reactive group (see Fig. 7). The identification of the selenium sites as the most prominent features in a difference Fourier map calculated with coefficients (IF~"'\ - 1 ~ ~ " " I ) expiccvAT1is unequivocal. One

very interesting feature observed in this difference electron map (and in some others, as will be discussed below), is a 0.4-nm movement of the Met-I01 side chain on the opposite surface of the monomer in relation to the selenium site. This residue may react to the change in charge distribution at the active site, since a negative charge is abstracted from the seleno-amino acid upon cyanide treatment of NATI crystals. No other significant structural changes possibly induced under the influence of cyanide were found. By refinement (EREF) and difference Fourier analysis of the deseleno enzyme strong evidence is provided that the reaction of SeCys-35 with cyanide proceeds via a displacement reaction, which could be described by the following reaction scheme : R - CH,

The inspection of a difference Fourier map, calculated with expieESErevealed a residual coefficients (IF~""1- lF~EsEl) density maximum (height 5 0 ) adjacent to Cfi of SeCys-35, which can be interpreted by a covalently bound cyano group. In the refined electron density map of the oxidized enzyme (NATI), no covalent connections of the selenocysteine side chains to ligands in its environment can be observed. Hence the active centres contain free selenocysteines or the corresponding oxidized derivatives, depending on the functional state of the enzyme. Fig. 7 shows the chemical environment of the selenocysteine residue in reduced GSH peroxidase. At physiological pH values a selenolate anion rathcr than an undissociated free selenol seems to occur in the reduced enzyme [5,6]. Further evidence is provided by a difference Fourier analysis between inhibited (PROP, JACE, see Table 2) and reduced enzyme, since only a selenolate anion would show considerable nucleophilic reactivity to react with the inhibitors propylenimine or iodoacetic acid. Significant difference electron-density maxima could be observed exclusively at the selenium sites and were assigned to bound amino-isopropyl or carboxymethyl residues. The inhibited enzyme forms did not show enzymatic activity as determined by the coupled test reaction [IS]. The movement of the Met-I01 side chain could be

observed even after inhibition of the peroxidase, more clearly in the derivative JACE than in the derivative PROP. The distances observed are consistent with the formation of hydrogen bonds of the selenolate to 148-Trp N (0.34 nm) and to 70-Gln N (0.33 nm) (see Table 1I), which certainly would result in some stabilization of the active-site geometry. Fig. 8 shows the same region of the model as Fig.7 but overlaid with the positive difference electron density calculated between oxidized ( 5 mM H,O,) and reduced GSH peroxidase. I The difference electron density (1 F:AT1- I FrAGSI) expiciyAT', which is contoured at the 2 0 level, is fitted satisfactorily by two additional selenium-bound oxygen atoms and therefore provides evidence for a seleninic acid existing in the peroxide-oxidized enzyme form NATI. A difference Fourier synthesis, calculated with coefficients - lFrATII) expieAT1, shows no difference density features at the position of the seleninic acid and proves the model to be in complete agreement with observed intensity data. The seleninic

acid derivative of GSH peroxidase certainly does not represent an irreversibly inactivated enzyme, since it can be readily reduced by GSH in the crystalline state to an enzyme form containing the catalytically active selenol. The seleninic acid could also be stabilized through coordination via hydrogen bonds (see Table 11). Thus the refined structure of the peroxide-oxidized enzyme (NATI) clearly points to the existence of a seleninic acid with pyramidal arrangement of /I-carbon, selenium, and oxygen atoms. The occurrence of selenocysteine residues in the active centres of GSH peroxidase poses an interesting question of how this unusual amino acid is incorporated into this enzyme. In most cases a specific post-translational modification of an existing amino acid in a polypeptide chain seems to be responsible for the occurrence of abnormal amino acids in a protein molecule. A selenocysteine may be formed in vivo by addition of selenide or selenoglutathione (GS-SeH) to a

Studies to reconstitute the native enzyme (NATI) by insertion of Se and S compounds into selenium-depleted crystals have been unsuccessful so far: treatment of seleniumfree enzyme with 1 mM sodium selenide in a reducing medium, (10 mM GSH/nitrogen), and alternatively with 1 mM selenite or sulfite under aerobic conditions, did not result in significant reflexion intensity changes as compared to the selenium-free crystals (DESE), a possible explanation is the binding of cyanide as proposed above. Upon selenite treatment a pronounced decrease of the mechanical stability of the crystals could be observed.

Substrate Binding and Catalytic Mechanism
The reduction of hydroperoxides by GSH peroxidase follows a ping-pong or enzyme substitution mechanism, as has been shown in a detailed kinetic analysis of the bovine enzyme [39]. One would expect this kinetic behaviour, if the catalysis occurs in independent consecutive steps and if enzymesubstrate complexes are either not formed at all or transformed immediately into enzyme derivatives. Furthermore, the mechanism implicates high affinity of the oxidized enzyme to its donor substrate GSH, whereas reduced GSH peroxidase should bind GSH with relatively low affinity. For the bovine enzyme the existence of a typical enzyme-substrate complex in presence of excess GSH could not be demonstrated by binding studies [40]. A detailed study of the substrate specificity with various thiol compounds [7] indicates that both carboxylic groups of the GSH molecule contribute to substrate binding and are probably bound by positively charged groups of the enzyme, since the activity decreases considerably if the yglutamyl residue of GSH is substituted by a y-aspartyl or N acetyl residue or if the glycine is replaced by a methoxy or amide group. In order to study substrate binding at low GSH concentrations, co-chromatography experiments were performed with [3H]GSHin an equimolar ratio with respect to the number of active sites of the enzyme. Under these conditions retention and tailing of the radioactivity peak due to interaction of GSH with binding sites on the enzyme could be observed. The result is shown in Fig. 9. Although this binding experiment was performed under non-equilibrium conditions a considerable amount of [3H]GSH, 9.8% of the total, remained bound to the enzyme. In a subsequent experiment the enzyme peak containing bound

Fig. 10. Time course of the release of bound radiouctivityfrom purified GSH peroxidase during dialysis. The protein peak, containing bound [3H]GSH from the experiment shown in Fig. 9, was pooled and four 50-pl portions were dialyzed in Teflon cells against 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The total content of each cell was used for radioactivity counting

[3H]GSH was pooled and four aliquots were dialyzed against 5 mM phosphate buffer, p H 7.0. Fig. 10 shows the time-course of the release of bound radioactivity from the enzyme during dialysis. This experiment demonstrates that t3H]GSH has been bound non-covalently to the peroxidase and furthermore that GSH binding prior to the formation of any putative sulfoselenide intermediate (see below) occurs via a reversible equilibrium as long as the system, consisting of enzyme and GSH, is in the reduced state. Recently the covalent binding of GSH to the peroxidase upon prolonged air-oxidation of enzyme together with its donor substrate has been reported [I 31. Under oxidizing conditions GSH peroxidase seems to contain one covalently bound GSH molecule per subunit; presumably via a selenosulfide linkage, (E-Se-SG). In a labeling experiment using crystalline GSH peroxidase (specific activity 160 Ujmg) we observed binding of 0.5 mol GSH/mol subunit (see Experimental Procedure). Since extensive washing in phosphate buffer prior to the radioactivity measurements did not remove the bound radioactivity from the crystals, we conclude that GSH has formed covalent bonds with the crystalline enzyme. In a difference Fourier synthesis between an analogous crystalline derivative (ACGS, see Table 1) and the native crystals we were not able to localize significant positive difference density maxima which could be assigned to bound GSH molecules, although the labeling experiment reproducibly has shown GSH

The GSNA - NATI : a positive, ill-defined and non-continuous shifts of the Met-101 side chains could again be recognized very difference density maximum near to SeCys-35, similar to that clearly.'In addit,ion there are movements of two other me- which can be observed in the derivative NAGS (described below) ; and a further density maximum stretching symmetrithionine side cKains (Met-69, Met-269) at the local twofold axis. The shifts are such that the sulfurs adopt positions more cally from the dimer contact surface at the local axis (residues distant to the local axis in the derivative ACGS. At present it interpreted as His-81, His-281) into the inner parts of each seems very difficult to explain whether these movements have monomer. Although this sausage-like difference density fades functional significance or not. out with increasing distance from the local axis, we assume that On the basis of similar experiments carried out in solution this density feature reflects a product (GSSG) binding site. the binding stoichiometry of active-site-directed 14C-labeled Whether this site fulfills a regulatory function or is only a haloacetates to native GSH peroxidase has been reported consequence of the high, unphysiological GSSG concentration (1.5 M sodium glutathionate buffer at p H 7.0 contains more [5,41].

In an attempt to titrate the active sites centration does appear to cause inhibition of the enzymatic activity of GSH peroxidase (A.

In the view of these experimental results and the binding Since the resulting positive difference density shown in stoichiometry obtained in the crystalline state, which is equiva- Fig. 11 appears discontinuous and poorly defined, we found it lent to binding of two GSH molecules per tetramer, half-site inappropriate to start model building studies and to fit the reactivity can be claimed for GSH peroxidase. In this case a density by insertion of a y-Glu-Cys-Gly model and substatistical distribution of the occupied active sites over the sequently refine the enzyme-substrate complex, but we would asymmetric units of the crystal cells should exist and hence a like to propose a hypothetical model of GSH binding, maximum overall occupancy of 0.5 GSH per binding site would based on an interpretation of the difference density which be observed. This number would explain our difficulties in would give the most probable fit. Among the active-site residues which could be of functional detecting GSH binding by difference Fourier methods applied to appropriate crystalline derivatives. In the case of half-site importance for substrate binding and catalysis are Arg-167, reactivity, which is related to negative cooperativity, the Arg-40, Gln-130 and Trp-148. During binding interaction the binding sites lose their equivalence and symmetry. Negative 1)-glutamylcarboxyl group of the GSH molecule is presumably cooperativity indicates that constituent protomers of an oligo- fixed by a salt bridge to Arg-167, whereas the N-terminal amino meric enzyme do not behave as independent entities. This group could form a hydrogen bond to Gln-I 30. The C-terminal would give a functional meaning to oligomeric structures glycyl carboxyl group, which due to the steric conditions should exhibiting classical kinetics: ping-pong kinetics in the case of point into the solvent space, seems to form an additional salt GSH peroxidase. Mechanisms describing the functional prop- bridge with Arg-40, which is a part of helix a l . The distances erties of half-site enzymes have been proposed [42] and assume between these functional residues of the peroxidase and their a functional interrelationship between distinct active sites on presumed counterparts on the GSH molecule, estimated at the identical monomers. It isfurther assumed that these oligomers graphics display, are in favour of the proposed model of GSH behave as `polydimers'. Indeed a polydimeric character appears binding (see Fig. 12). Solution studies of the influence of the cyclic peroxide 3,6to be a fairly general feature of enzymes with subunit structure. on The fact that in crystalline GSH peroxidase the dimers of an dihydroxy-3,6-dimethyl-1,2-dioxane the enzymatic activity asymmetric unit exhibit local twofold symmetry [12] suggests of GSH peroxidase showed neither inhibition of the reaction that small structural differences might exist between the nor revealed any measurable turnover. Obviously cyclic permonomers. Hence the tetramers might function as (CLP)~ oxides are not metabolized by GSH peroxidase, as has been entities. The dimeric structure probably loses its symmetry by observed repeatedly with dialkyl peroxides [43]. A complete binding of one GSH molecule. Therefore subtle confor- inhibition of the enzymatic activity indeed could be observed mational changes or charge interactions over a distance of after treatment of the GSH-reduced enzyme with 2 mM more than 2 nm are believed to occur in the peroxidase by which peroxodisulphate. Difference Fourier analysis of the corthe occupied active site moderates the reactivity of the free site responding derivative (PODS) revealed a positive difference in the sense of negative cooperativity. We assume these changes density maximum stretching symmetrically across the local axis to take place between the subunits of a dimer with local at the positions of the residues interpreted as His-81, His-281 ; nearly at the same position where we assume GSSG binding to symmetry. Several indirect lines of evidence indicate structural re- occur. Presumably these histidine residues, which are about arrangements upon GSH binding. A highly structured ultra- 1.O nm away from SeCys-35, can influence the catalytic process, violet difference spectrum and perturbations in the ultraviolet but this phenomenon is not understood in molecular terms at circular dichroism spectrum are observed under the influence present. N o changes at the selenium sites other than seleninic of the reducing substrate [40]. These changes might indicate acid formation could be observed upon peroxodisulphate small but distinct conformational rearrangements, which could treatment. In general, one important observation, which should inalso be observed by difference Fourier analyses of reduced and fluence our picture of the catalytic function of this enzyme, oxidized enzyme forms. Under the influence of a very high GSH concentration, as is could be obtained by comparing the results of the difference present in the derivative GSNA (1.5 M sodium glutathionate Fourier analyses : difference Fourier analyses between oxidized buffer, pH7.0), two binding sites per monomer could be (e.g. DESE - NATI) or reduced (e.g. JACE - NAGS) enzyme localized in the corresponding difference electron density map forms appear clear and well-defined, whereas all those between

a reduced and an oxidized form (e.g. NAGS - NATI) show a noisy character. Hence small and subtle conformational changes or side-chain movements must occur when the oxidation state of the peroxidase is changed. There is no crystallographic evidence indicating the occurrence of large conformational changes upon reduction by GSH. During refinement of the structure, we were able to identify an additional cysteine (Cys-64), which does not bind mercury compounds and shows a very low accessibility. Based on a calculated minimum distance of 1.4 nm between selenocysteine and sulfurcysteine residues, a thioselenide mechanism, involving direct interaction of SeCys-35 with a protein-bound cysteine -SH group can be ruled out. In conclusion, we can present a general picture of a reaction mechanism which is in reasonable agreement with most of the existing functional data and with the results obtained during analysis of the GSH peroxidase structure in Fig. 13. A selenolate anion (*) in reduced GSH peroxidase and a seleninic acid (**), occurring in the peroxide-oxidized enzyme, can be observed by crystallographic methods. Biochemical data support the formation of selenosulfide bonds upon reduction by the donor substrate GSH [13]. During catalysis the oxida-

tion state of the peroxidase would, of course, depend on the relative concentrations of reducing and oxidizing substrates. Assuming physiological substrate concentrations (GSH in the millimolar range and peroxide substrates in the micromolar range) [44] the main reaction would certainly shuttle between the selenolate and the selenenic acid state. After interaction of the selenolate anion with the peroxide substrate, the hypothetical selenenic acid, which would have only transient existence, is likely to immediately undergo reduction by excess GSH normally present in the cell.

Note Added in Proof. Recently an important progress on the sequence analysis of rat liver GSH peroxidase could be achieved [Condell, R. A. and Tappel, A. L. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 709, 3041. The amino acid sequence of the first 46N-terminal residues could be obtained from the overlapping sequences of a tryptic selenopeptide and by sequencing of the intact subunit from its N-terminal end. A surprinsingly good agreement between the sequences determined independently by sequencing of the rat liver enzyme and by crystallographic refinement of the structure of the bovine erythrocyte enzyme can be stated. Considering the tryptic selenopeptide, the correlation is 100 A correlation of 75 "/, could be calculated for the N-terminal peptide (Ala-l - Lys-24).
