Role of Structural and Dynamical Plasticity in Sin3: The Free PAH2 Domain is a Folded Module in mSin3B
Hugo van Ingen, Maria A. H. Baltussen, Jan Aelen and Geerten W. Vuister*
Department of Physical Chemistry/Biophysical Chemistry, Institute for Molecules and Materials Radboud University Nijmegen Toernooiveld 1, 6525 ED Nijmegen, the Netherlands The co-repressor Sin3 is the essential scaffold protein of the Sin3/HDAC corepressor complex, which is recruited to the DNA by a diverse group of transcriptional repressors, targeting genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation. Sin3 contains four repeats commonly denoted as paired amphipathic helix (PAH1-4) domains that provide the principal interaction surface for various repressors. Here, we present the first structure of the free state of the PAH2 domain and discuss its implications for interaction with the repressors. The unbound conformation is very similar to the conformation observed when bound to either the Mad1 or HBP1 repressor, suggesting that the PAH2 domain serves as a template that guides proper folding of the unstructured repressor. The free PAH2 domain shows micro- to millisecond conformational exchange between the folded, major state and a partially unfolded, minor state. Upon complex formation, we observe a significant decrease in fast time-scale flexibility of local regions of the protein, correlated with the formation of intermolecular contacts, and an overall decrease in the slow time-scale conformational exchange. On the basis of our data and using a multiple sequence alignment of all PAH domains, we suggest that the PAH1, PAH2 and PAH3 domains form pre-folded binding modules in full-length Sin3 like beads-on-a-string, and act as folding templates for the interaction domains of their targets.

Introduction
The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes requires the formation of specific protein­DNA and protein­protein complexes.1 Transcriptional activators and repressors recognize specific DNA sequences upstream of the promoter of target genes, resulting in either up-regulation or downregulation of transcription.2,3 This is achieved

indirectly via recruitment of co-regulators and associated proteins that together are capable of shaping the chromatin structure into an active or repressive state.4­7 The association between the activator/repressor and the co-regulator is a crucial step, as it provides the link between target gene and chromatin modification. A diverse group of repressors recruit a coregulator complex containing the highly conserved co-repressor Sin3,8 and the class I histone deacetylating proteins (HDAC1/2). The HDAC proteins deacetylate specific lysine residues in the tails of the histone proteins, resulting in a compact, repressive chromatin state.9­13 The core Sin3/HDAC complex further consists of Sin3 associated proteins (SAP18 and SAP30), that are thought to stabilize the complex,11,14 and histone-targeting proteins (RbAp48 and RbAp46), that stabilize contact with the nucleosome.9,11 Additionally, the core Sin3/ HDAC co-repressor complex exists of SDS3,15 SAP130 and SAP18016 and can be extended with

486 extra catalytic modules, such as the monosaccharide O-GlcNAc transferase OGT.17 Sin3 contains four imperfect repeats, denoted as PAH domains that were originally presumed to fold into paired amphipathic helices,18 and a highly conserved region that is responsible for interaction with HDAC1/2, referred to as the HDAC interaction domain (HID) (Figure 1(a)). The second PAH domain, PAH2 and, to a lesser extent, the PAH1 and PAH3 domains have been identified as the regions required for interaction with the repressor, 8 whereas the PAH4 domain is required for association with the monosaccharide transferase OGT.17 The mammalian homolog of Sin3 exists in two isoforms, mSin3A and mSin3B,19 that most likely have separable functional roles.20,21 Structurally, Sin3 has remained largely uncharacterized. So far, the interaction between Sin3 and the transcriptional repressor Mad1 has received considerable attention, as Mad1 is part of the Myc/ Max/Mad network involved in the switch between cell proliferation and cell differentiation.22,23 Solution structures of the PAH2 domain complexed to the Sin3 interacting domain (SID) of Mad1 have shown that the complex is folded as a "wedged helical bundle", in which the PAH2 domain adopts a four helix bundle conformation into which the a-helix of the SID is inserted.24­26 Recently, the

HMG box-containing repressor HBP1, which targets several cell cycle-specific and differentiationspecific genes, was shown to interact with the PAH2 domain.27 Interestingly, the structure of this complex showed a reversed orientation of the SID relative to the Mad1 complex, while maintaining the overall fold. The reversal of this helix orientation is correlated with a reversal in the SID sequence motif.27 In contrast to the well-studied bound state of the PAH2 domain, the unbound state of the domain has not been described. However, knowledge of both bound and unbound states is of paramount importance to allow an evaluation of the structural and dynamic changes induced upon complex formation, and will result in a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of repressor­corepressor interaction. Here, we report the solution structure and dynamics on fast and slow timescales of the unbound PAH2 domain of mammalian Sin3B and discuss its implications for the PAH­SID interaction. While previous studies have suggested that the PAH2 domain might not be fully folded in its unbound form, and that PAH2 and the SID experience a coupled folding transition, we show that the domain is folded and that the structural and dynamic plasticity in PAH2 upon complex formation is limited to a fine-tuning of the

487 is essentially preserved between unbound and peptide-bound states. Hence, we conclude that the C-terminal tail is unstructured in our construct and does not interact with the binding pocket of PAH2. Given its superior stability and spectral quality, this PAH2B-105 construct was used for further structural and dynamic studies. Structure The backbone traces of the unbound PAH2B-105 ensemble and the best representative structure are shown in Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively. In total, 1007 unique distance restraints and 131 f,j dihedral angle restraints were used to calculate the solution structure. Residues 233­252, which constitute the unstructured C-terminal tail, were not included in the structure calculation. The pairwise heavy-atom RMSD of the ordered parts ° of the structure is 0.68 A for the backbone and ° 1.46 A overall, indicating a well-defined ensemble (Table 1). Analysis of the per-residue quality parameter U shows that the structural quality of the ensemble of structures is well determined by the experimental data (see Supplementary Data).27 Further statistical data for the ensemble are reported in Table 1. The domain adopts a fourhelix bundle fold that was found also for the structure of the complex of PAH2 and Mad1SID.24­26 The four helices are formed by residues 153­167 (a1), 172­189 (a2), 202­212 (a3) and 217­ 226 (a4). Residues 168­171 and 213­216 fold into turns, and residues 190­201 form a large loop between helices a2 and a3. The most striking feature of the PAH2 structure is its large solvent-exposed hydrophobic binding ° pocket of ca 510 A2 (averaged over the ensemble) (Figure 2(c)). This exposed conformation is caused by poor packing of helix a1 to the remainder of the helical bundle. Whereas the helices a2­a3 and a3­a4 arrange as nearly anti-parallel, the angle between a1 and a2 is w1458. As a result, tight packing of helices a1 and a2 is restricted to two helical turns adjacent to the connecting turn. In contrast, helices a3 and a4 pack closely along their full lengths (Figure 2(d)). The interface between the latter two helices is composed of complementary bulky (F206, L220, F223) and smaller side-chains (V205, V209, A210, G224). In contrast, a large angle between a1 and a2 is required to accommodate the bulky side-chains in their interface (Y160, I164, K165, Y175, F178, L179). Most notably, the bulky F223 in a4 faces the smaller V205 and V209 in a3, while the corresponding residue F178 in a2 points towards the also bulky residues Y160 and I164 in a1. Furthermore, Y175 in the top of the a1,a2-interface is more bulky than the corresponding L220 in the a3,a4-interface (Figure 2(d)). The resulting poor packing of helices a1 and a2 creates a gap, which is further emphasized as these helices are longer than their counterparts a3 and a4. To examine possible structural changes of the PAH2B domain upon binding of target peptides, we

interaction surface. In addition, we show that the PAH1-3 domains most likely form folded modules within Sin3, as beads-on-string, and are ready to accommodate their specific interaction partners.

Results
Optimization of the PAH2 domain construct Our previous studies of the PAH2 domain of mSin3B in complex with SID of Mad1 used a PAH2 domain construct of 105 residues and showed that the folded part of the domain comprises about 75 residues.25,26 Therefore, for the study of the free PAH2 domain, a construct was made consisting of 85 amino acid residues (148­232 of Mm. mSin3B, denoted as PAH2B-85), comprising the domain with five extra residues at both the N and the C terminus. To assess the conformational integrity of this domain, a 2D 1H­15N correlation spectrum (15Nheteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC)) was recorded (shown in Figure 1(c)). The lack of dispersion of backbone amide resonances and the severe line broadening of several resonances indicate that this polypeptide does not adopt a well-defined tertiary structure in solution. The observed conformational heterogeneity persists over a wide range of temperatures and under different buffer conditions. In sharp contrast, the HSQC spectrum obtained from a PAH2 construct extended with an additional 20 residues at the C terminus (148­252 of Mm. mSin3B, denoted as PAH2B-105) shows a greatly improved spectrum (Figure 1(d)). This improvement is probably caused by an enhanced solubility of the longer construct in combination with reduced aggregation (see Discussion). The increased dispersion and the more homogeneous linewidths suggest that the PAH2B domain is folded. In order to assess the potential interference between the PAH2 domain and its C-terminal tail, we analyzed both the structural and dynamic properties. Both 13 a C and 13Cb chemical shifts of all residues are within one standard deviation from random coil values. Only intra-residual and sequential nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) cross-peaks could be identified in the NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra (data not shown). Furthermore, fast timescale dynamics indicates that the tail is extremely flexible with local motions on a time-scale of about one-tenth of the global tumbling rate (vide infra). Relaxation-dispersion measurements also did not give any indication for the existence of a minor, possibly interfering, conformation for this region (vide infra). In addition, the tail does not impede binding of the SID. The spectral dispersion in the HSQC spectrum of PAH2B-105 complexed to the Mad1SID is further improved (Figure 1(e)). The overall resonance pattern does not change drastically between the unbound and bound forms of PAH2B-105, which suggests that the fold of PAH2

compared the structure of the unbound domain with the two different complexes solved to date, the PAH2-Mad124­26 complex and the PAH2-HBP1 complex.28 A structural superposition of the best representatives of each ensemble is shown in Figure 3. The helices in the free domain and in the Mad1 complex superimpose well, with an RMSD of ° 1.09 A, indicating that the global fold of PAH2 is unchanged after ligand binding. A slightly higher ° RMSD of 1.37 A is found for the HBP1 complex. ° Excluding helix a1, the RMSD drops to 0.86 A, reflecting a small but noticeable difference in the angle between helices a1 and a2 in the two ensembles of structures, which has been reported by Swanson et al.28 To compare the side-chain orientations between the three structures, only residues with sufficient experimental restraints to result in well-defined side-chain orientations in the three ensembles of structures were taken into account. The resulting ° ° heavy-atom RMSD is 1.40 A (1.61 A) between the free structure and the Mad1 complex (HBP1 complex). This is roughly within the precision of the ensembles. More specifically, crucial residues in the binding pocket have nearly identical side-chain positions in both the free and the bound forms (Figure 3(b)). In general, these residues form

the "floor" of the binding pocket. Several residues at the edges of the pocket, e.g. E183, Y160, H183, Q186, Q225 and F226, are disordered in the free structure. Interestingly, residue F154 has a well defined side-chain orientation in both the unbound state and in the Mad1-SID complex, but is disordered in the HBP1 complex. In the Mad1 complex it is part of the binding pocket and is responsible for several intermolecular contacts, while in the HBP1 complex it is pointing away from the binding pocket, into the solvent. Fast time-scale dynamics In addition to inducing structural changes, binding events usually affect the dynamic behavior of proteins. In earlier work, we have characterized in detail the backbone dynamics of the Mad1-SID complex occurring on a pico- to nanosecond timescale.26 Here, we investigated these fast backbone motions in the unbound state of PAH2B. The 15N longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates (R1 and R1r, respectively) and the steady-state nuclear Overhauser effect ({1H}­15N NOE) were measured for 69 out of 102 non-proline residues (see Supplementary Data, Figure S1). The resonances of the remaining 33 residues were too severely

489 loop between helices a2 and a3 and for the C-terminal tail. A few residues have high R1r/R1 ratios, indicating the presence of chemical exchange on the micro- to millisecond time-scale. This is elaborated on in more detail in the slow dynamics section. The C-terminal tail is highly flexible on a fast time-scale, judged from its very low {1H}­15N NOE values (average 0.02G0.47) and R1r/R1 ratios (average 3.4(G2.3) sK1). It has been shown that the presence of such a flexible tail frustrates the quantitative description of dynamics using the model-free approach, as evidenced by anomalous high values for the model-free parameters.29 As the reorientation of the tail is on the time-scale of the global reorientation, this results in a time-dependence of the diffusion tensor, which constitutes a violation of the central assumption of the modelfree approach that local and global motions can be decoupled.30,31 In contrast, reduced spectral density mapping does not make any assumption about the nature or time-scales of local and global motions and is used to qualitatively describe the local dynamics in term of the spectral densities J(u) at the frequencies 0, uN and 0.87uH.32­34 In short, assuming no internal motion and a rigid isotropic rotor, J(0) equals 2 tc, whereas smaller values for J(0) 5 indicate internal mobility of the N­H bond on a sub-nanosecond time-scale. Fast internal motions result also in an increase in J(0.87uH) values, while the J(uN) spectral density decreases for small to medium-sized proteins. Motions on a micro- to millisecond time-scale result in a chemical exchange contribution to the transverse relaxation rate. When the observed R1r is not corrected for this additional contribution, these motions are reflected by elevated values for J(0), but do not affect the J(uN) or J(0.87uH) values. Figure 4(a) presents J(0.87uH)­J(0) and J(uN)­J(0) correlation plots and illustrates the markedly different dynamics of the core and the tail of the

overlapping to extract peak intensities reliably. The structured regions have NOE values close to 0.8, indicating that fast local motion is limited. Low NOE values with concomitant low R1r/R1 ratios indicate high local flexibility for the N terminus, the

protein. Three clusters can be readily identified. These clusters are schematically represented on a structure model that includes the C-terminal tail (Figure 4(b)). Firstly, the disordered C-terminal and N-terminal tails (group I; residues 148­151, 238­ 252) have an extremely high level of local flexibility, as indicated by the very low J(0) values and corresponding high J(0.87uH) and lower J(uN) values. The J(0.87uH) and J(0) values and the J(uN) and J(0) values show the expected linear correlation, indicating the superposition of a global and local motion.32 Secondly, the relatively disordered first two turns of helix a1, the a2­a3 loop and the transition region between the core of the protein and the tail (group II, residues 152­156, 190­ 200, 234­237) also have increased flexibility on a sub-nanosecond and a picosecond time-scale as judged by their lower J(0) and higher J(0.87uH) spectral densities. Group III (residues 157­189, 201­

233) contains all residues in structured regions (except the N-terminal part of helix a1) and can be divided into two subgroups. Group IIIa has a rather homogeneous J(0) close to the theoretical curve for a rigid isotropic rotor, reflecting restricted internal motions for the N­H vector. The apparent isotropic tc is 9 ns for this group. The spread in J(uN) and J(0.87uH) values reflects a small anisotropy in the rotational diffusion. Group IIIb has elevated apparent J(0) values, indicating significant chemical exchange contributions. These residues (164, 167­ 169, 174, 183, 201, 215, 223, 226 and 232) were identified also by the relaxation-dispersion experiments and are discussed below. Slow time-scale dynamics To probe the backbone dynamics on a micro- to millisecond time-scale, effective 15N-R2 values were

determined as a function of pulse spacing in Carr­ Purcell­Meiboom­Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion experiments. Dispersion profiles could be determined for 68 residues at three magnetic field strengths. Residues in the N terminus and the C-terminal tail did not show any dispersion of their effective R2 values. Most residues in the core of the protein and in the transition region between helix a4 and the tail showed significant R2 dispersion. Representative dispersion profiles are shown in Figure 4(c). Assuming two-site exchange between a major (a) and minor (b) state, exchange parameters were determined by global fitting of the CarverRichards-Jen all time-scale approximation to the dispersion profiles. All residues are in fast-tointermediate exchange. Out of 43 residues with significant dispersion, 33 could be fit in a single cluster with exchange rate, kex, equal to 1.30(G 0.05)!103 sK1 and the population of the minor state, pb, equal to 0.92(G0.05)%. The remaining ten residues were fit using a second cluster with kex equal to 2.29(G0.13)!103 sK1 and pb equal to 1.20(G0.07)% (Supplementary Data). The two clusters are mapped onto the unbound PAH2B structure (left panel of Figure 4(d)). The first cluster contains mostly residues in helices and a few in the a2­a3 loop. The cluster with the higher exchange rate comprises residues in the turn between helix a1 and a2 and the C-terminal part of a4 with subsequent residues. Relaxation dispersion profiles depend also on the magnitude of the frequency difference between the two exchanging states a and b (jDubaj). This frequency difference is expressed more conveniently as a difference in chemical shifts, jDdbaj. The right panel of Figure 4(d) displays the jDdbaj values mapped onto the PAH2B structure. On average, the chemical shift difference is w2 ppm. Residues in helix a3 experience, on average, the smallest change in chemical shift (1.38(G0.3) ppm), while three regions form hot-spots with large average values for jDdbaj: the turn between a1 and a2 (3.4(G2) ppm), residues 198­201, which form a relatively ordered part of the loop adjacent to helix a3 (3.1(G1) ppm), and the C-terminal part of helix a4 with adjacent residues in the linker region (4.6(G2) ppm). Structural characterization of the minor conformation is possible only if both the magnitude and the sign of Ddba are known, allowing reconstruction of the chemical shifts of the minor state.35­38 We determined the sign using a new experiment, named CEESY66 and confirmed these results using the comparison of peak positions in heteronuclear single quantum and multiple quantum correlation spectra.35 The resulting signs of the chemical shift differences were combined with their magnitude, as determined from the relaxation-dispersion experiments. Comparison of the resulting signed chemical shift differences, Ddba, with the chemical shift differences between the free and bound forms of PAH2 showed no correlation (RZ0.08). However, comparison of Ddab with the deviation from the random coil shifts39 resulted in a reasonable

The continuous line is the linear least-squares best fit line through the data points (RZ0.82).

correlation (RZ0.82) (Figure 5), suggesting that the minor conformation is a (partially) unfolded state. Comparison with shifts of fully unfolded PAH2 in 8 M guanidinium chloride resulted in a similar correlation (data not shown). Furthermore, our CEESY experiment enabled us to determine the sign of the frequency difference for the amide proton.66 As shown in Table 2, nearly all signs of Ddba for both the amide proton and nitrogen atom in the three hot-spots indicate a shift toward random coil values, in agreement with an order­disorder transition.

Discussion
Influence of the C-terminal tail We observed significant differences in the 15NHSQC spectra of two different PAH2B domain constructs. While a spectrum consistent with one dominant folded conformation is observed for PAH2B-105, that of PAH2B-85 is typical for a protein in intermediate exchange between multiple conformations. Given the limited chemical shift dispersion, it is likely that the exchange process in PAH2B-85 is, similar to that in PAH2B-105, an interconversion between the folded state and a partially unfolded molten globule state. There is no evidence that the observed stabilization of the folded conformation in PAH2B-105 is caused by a (partial) association of the tail with the binding pocket, or any other part of the PAH2 domain. Given the extreme flexibility of the tail, transient interactions are also unlikely. Improvement in the solubility by the highly hydrophilic tail could

contribute to the observed stabilization, although the short construct did not show severe problems with precipitation. Alternatively, it is plausible that the tail reduces the formation of soluble microaggregates that could be formed by partially unfolded states of the protein domain. In addition, charged residues in the tail could be involved in stabilizing long-range electrostatic interactions. Together, this could result in a stabilization of the folded conformation, resembling the way in which the GB1 domain can be used as a solubilization enhancement tag.40 Sequence analysis shows that the sequence of this C-terminal region is conserved in the B-isoforms of the PAH2 domain of the vertebrates human, mouse and the African clawed frog, which could point to a general requirement for this region for the stabilization of the PAH2 domain of mSin3B (data not shown). After submission of the manuscript, the solution structure of the PAH1 domain of mSin3B bound to the SID of the NRSF/REST repressor was published.41 Interestingly, this structure shows that a conserved region after the C terminus of the PAH1 domain is folded as a short helix, and is packed against helices a3 and a4 of the PAH1 domain.41 Structural plasticity of complex formation The global folds of the unbound, Mad1-bound and HBP1-bound PAH2 domain are virtually identical. This is rather surprising, as the hydro-

phobic interaction surface of the PAH2 domain is exposed to the solvent in the unbound form (Figure 2(c)). This open conformation is a consequence of the poor complementarity of side-chains in the a1,a2-interface, forcing helix a1 out of the core formed by helices a2, a3 and a4 (Figure 2(d)). The limited structural rearrangement of the main chain is paralleled by only minor changes in sidechain conformation upon binding. Specifically, most side-chains that interact directly with the SID have practically identical conformations in the unbound and both the Mad1-SID and HBP1-SID bound states. In contrast, larger structural changes are thought to occur within the SID. Both the SID of Mad1 and HBP1 are most likely unstructured in their free state, but fold to form an amphipathic a-helix when bound to PAH2.28,42 The folded SID interacts with the binding pocket of PAH2 via a precise arrangement of bulky and small side-chains, like knobs-inholes. Interestingly, HBP1 and Mad1 bind with opposite helical orientations to complement the predefined knobs and holes of PAH2, as the crucial SID residues are reversed in the sequence.28 A recent mutation study stressed the importance of the complementarity of bulky and small residues in the center of the interaction surface as a basis for specificity and affinity of the SID­PAH2 interaction.43 In addition to these general interactions, Mad1 and HBP1 each have a number of unique interactions with PAH2, involving residues at the edge of the binding pocket. The unique stacking interaction between F154 of PAH2 and Y18 of Mad1 was identified as the critical determinant of specificity of Mad1 for the PAH2 versus the PAH1 domain.44 Notably, F154 becomes disordered in the HBP1 complex, as the HBP1-SID does not provide an aromatic residue at the corresponding position of Mad1-Y18. Conversely, V152, E153, P228 and a few residues at the C-terminal end of helix a2 interact uniquely with HBP1. In addition, residues at the edges of the binding pocket of PAH2 are involved in specific intermolecular interactions with residues outside the minimal Mad1-SID.26 The view emerging from the current data indicates that complex formation involves a folding transition of the SID, while the PAH2 domain experiences only limited structural rearrangements. Recent computational analyses of protein­protein interactions have shown that the conformation of crucial residues in the unbound and in the bound state can be very similar for at least one of the interacting proteins.45,46 The structured, unbound PAH2 domain might then serve as a folding template, defining the proper fold of the SID. This suggests that the short construct, PAH2B-85, which is only partially folded, will have a lower binding affinity for the SID. A reasonable mechanism for complex formation is a combination of induced fit and conformational selection.46 In this model, a few residues of the SID serve as "anchors", whose sidechains are inserted into the well-defined pocket in the core of the interaction surface of PAH2,

493 the drastic reduction in the J(0.87uH) density with a concomitant increase in J(0). This correlates with the formation of intermolecular interactions that "lock" this helix. Other parts of the interaction surface do not experience such large changes, indicating that the impact of binding on the fast time-scale dynamics seems to be restricted to the part of the interaction surface that is more flexible in the unbound state. On the other hand, binding reduces slow time-scale motions for all residues that experience chemical exchange in the unbound state, as demonstrated by a decrease in their apparent J(0) values. This finding was confirmed also by the absence of significant dispersion of 15N transverse relaxation rates, as determined with relaxation dispersion experiments on the PAH2­ Mad1 complex (data not shown). Interaction with the SID thus stabilizes the PAH2 domain with respect to the partially unfolded state, which may be correlated with the protection of the hydrophobic binding pocket from the solvent. Finally, the change in dynamics of residue Y175 seems to signify a more isotropic global rotational diffusion for the complex compared to the free domain (Figure 6). PAH2 in Sin3A versus Sin3B The vertebrate Sin3 protein exists in two isoforms, known as mSin3A and mSin3B,19 as a result of gene duplication early in evolution.8 Interestingly, NMR spectra of the unbound PAH2 domain of mouse Sin3A, PAH2A, showed that the domain exists in two forms in a roughly one-to-one ratio that interconvert slowly on the NMR time-scale,24,28 as opposed to the fast-to-intermediate interconversion with a 1% populated minor state observed for PAH2B in this study. We suggest that both exchange processes are interconversions between a partially unfolded and a fully folded state. The observed differences in the kinetics and thermodynamics of this interconversion have to originate from differences in sequence, as the experimental conditions for the PAH2A and PAH2B studies are comparable. Indeed, the hot spots of exchange are also the regions with the highest level of sequence variability (Figure 1(b)). Different thermodynamic stability of the PAH domain could be related to functional differences between mSin3A and mSin3B by altering the free energy of interaction with binding partners. Also, different life-times for the folded form, caused by the different exchange time-scales, can affect binding of interacting proteins. The PAH domains in full-length Sin3 To assess the conservation of crucial residues between the different PAH domains, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of 35 Sin3 homologues and subsequently aligned their PAH domains using ClustalW48 (Supplementary Data, Figure S3). The region identified originally as the

producing a native-like encounter complex. We suggest that the two central bulky hydrophobic residues (F) in the FXXFFXAA minimal interaction motif, i.e. L12 and L13 in Mad1, act as anchor-residues. Binding affinity is subsequently optimized by an induced-fit process in the periphery of the binding interface,46,47 including the formation of SID-dependent, unique interactions. Dynamic plasticity of complex formation The PAH2B domain shows a rich and complex dynamics, both on the fast and slow time-scales. Reduced spectral density mapping showed that the helices, the loop and the tail form three regions with increasing fast local flexibility. On a micro- to millisecond time-scale, the PAH2B domain is interconverting with a minor form that is populated for roughly 1%. The turn between helices a1 and a2, a relatively ordered part of the loop and the C-terminal part of helix a4 with the adjacent linker region form three hot-spots that experience large changes in chemical environment. The minor state most likely constitutes a partially unfolded state, as indicated by a shift towards random coil values for the chemical shifts of both the amide 1H and 15N nucleus. Interestingly, residues in the turn between a1 and a2 show exchange on a significantly faster time-scale than the helices, which could be the result of a modulation of the angle between a1 and a2, altering the accessibility of the binding pocket. Figure 6 shows the ten most significant changes in the fast time-scale dynamics between unbound PAH2B and the Mad1­SID complex.26 Complex formation results in a reduction in fast time-scale dynamics for the first two turns of a1, as shown by

494 PAH4 domain has, on average, only 9% identity with the other three PAH domains (Supplementary Data, Table S2). This region is not identified as a PAH domain by domain detection programs such as NCBI's conservative domain search,49 and different domain boundaries have been reported.19,50 The alignment of the PAH4 domain with the other PAH domain used here was optimized manually to match the structurally important residues of the PAH2 domain. However, several buried, hydrophobic residues, which are structurally important and highly conserved in PAH1-3, are replaced by hydrophilic and/or nonconserved residues in PAH4 (e.g. residues V209, L219 and L220 in PAH2; Supplementary Data, Table S3). Alternative alignments result in mismatches at other positions. This indicates that the PAH4 region most likely does not fold as a four-helix bundle, but instead adapts a distinct fold. Contrastingly, the PAH1, PAH2 and PAH3 domains are highly conserved and have significant homology (Supplementary Data, Table S2). Residues in the core and in the interaction surface are conserved or conservatively mutated throughout these PAH domains (Supplementary Data, Table S3), indicating that the general fold and mode of interaction with the SID is conserved. Residues at the edges of the binding pocket (V152-I158, Q186 and E202) are less conserved, indicating that these residues play a role in defining the specificity of each member of the PAH domain family (Supplementary Data, Table S3 and Figure S2). Notably, A157 of PAH2B that is part of the interaction surface is conserved in the PAH1 domain but is replaced by a conserved glutamic acid residue in PAH3, suggesting a role for electrostatic interaction with the SID. Furthermore, the bulky and buried aromatic side-chains in the helix a1,a2 interface (F178 and Y160) and the buried side-chains in the a3,a4 interface (V205, V209, and F223) are conserved between the different PAH2 sequences, and conserved or mutated conservatively throughout the PAH1 and PAH3 domains (Supplementary Data, Table S3). This suggests strongly that the "open" conformation is an intrinsic feature of the PAH domain. The solution structure of the PAH1 domain of mSin3B bound to the SID of the NRSF/REST repressor, published after submission of our manuscript, shows that the complex is very similar to the structures of the PAH2 domain complexes: the PAH1 domain is folded as a four-helix bundle and the SID is wedged between helices a1 and a2.41 NMR spectra of the unbound PAH1 domain both in that study and in our own experiments (data not shown) are of a quality similar to that of the extended PAH2B construct, indicating that the unbound PAH1 domain is probably folded as well. Thus, on the basis of our structure of the PAH2B domain and the multiple sequence alignment of the PAH domains, we suggest that the PAH1, PAH2 and PAH3 domains can form folded modules in full-length Sin3, like beads-on-a-string, and that the PAH4 domain probably has a distinct fold. Conclusion

The Free PAH2 Domain of Sin3

The solution structure of the unbound PAH2 domain shows that the domain is folded and that its conformation does not change appreciably upon binding of its interaction partners, either the Mad1SID or HBP1-SID. Notably, the binding pocket is accessible in the unbound structure as a result of conserved bulky residues in the helix a1,a2 interface that prevent close packing of a1 with the core. In addition, the orientation of crucial interacting side-chains is highly similar in the bound and unbound states, suggesting that they guide folding of the unstructured SID by defining a folding template. A more pronounced change is seen in the dynamics of unbound PAH2. The N-terminal part of helix a1 is rigidified by intermolecular interactions with the SID. Furthermore, conformational exchange with a minor, partially unfolded state is quenched when the SID is bound, indicating a stabilization of the folded state of the domain. On the basis of our data and multiple sequence alignment of the PAH domains, we suggest that the PAH1, PAH2 and PAH3 domains form folded binding modules in full-length Sin3 like beads-ona-string and act as a folding template for the SID in complex formation.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation All NMR studies were performed using a protein construct of 85 or 105 residues (denoted as PAH2B) corresponding to residues 148­232 (PAH2B-85) and 148­ 252 (PAH2B-105), respectively, of the long variant of Mm. mSin3B (SpTrEMBL accession number Q62141). Cloning, expression and purification of the PAH2B domain were performed as described.51 Uniformly 15N/13C-labeled PAH2B was prepared using 15NNH4Cl and [13C6]glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources. NMR samples contained 0.5 to 0.9 mM 13C/15N double-labeled protein in a buffer of 50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 6.3), 100 mM KCl, 95% H2O/5% 2H2O using protease inhibitor Pefabloc and a trace of NaN3 as preservative. NMR spectroscopy All NMR experiments were carried out on Varian Unity Inova 500, 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers. The data were processed using the NMRPipe suite,52 and analyzed using XEASY53 and Sparky. Assignments were obtained using 3D HNCA, HNCACB, CBCACONH, HNCAHA, (H)CCHtotal correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY), CBCDHD, 15N NOESY-HSQC and aliphatic and aromatic 13C NOESYHSQC spectra. Stereo-specific assignments of the pro-R and pro-S methyl groups of Val and Leu-residues were made on the basis of a CT-13C-HSQC of 10% 13C-labeled PAH2B sample.54 Distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained from the 3D 15N and 13C-separated NOESY spectra. The NOE mixing time in all NOESY experiments was set to 100 ms. Backbone N, HN, Ca, Cb, C 0 , and Ha  http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/

significant when the RMSD of a fit to a straight line was larger than twice the error based on noise. The program GLOVE (by J. C. Lansing and P. E. Wright, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to fit the effective R2 values for all data sets simultaneous to the Carver­Richards­Jen all time-scale approximation.64,65 First, all residues were fit individually and the reduced c2 value of residue i, c2 i;individual , was calculated. Then, residues in the same secondary structure element were fitted simultaneous in a global fit and the reduced chisquared value of residue i in the global fit, c2 i;global , was calculated. In the global fit the exchange rate constant kex and the populations pa and pb were optimized globally, while the chemical shift difference Du and the exchange free R2 were optimized for each fitted residue. If necessary, these elements were redefined until the global 2 fit was accepted, defined as c2 i;global ! 1:5ci;individual . Subsequently, these elements were iteratively combined in global fits as long as these fits were accepted. Databank accession numbers The coordinates of the structures are deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under PDB accession number 2F05. The chemical shifts and relaxation data of the free PAH2B domain are deposited in the BioMagResBank under BMRB accession number 6899.

atoms of unfolded PAH2 were assigned using a HNCACB, HNCO and HNCAHA experiments. The 15N-T1, 15N-T1r and {1H}­15N NOE experiments were recorded at 20.0 8C at 14.1 T. All experiments were recorded in an interleaved manner. Relaxation delays were: 16 ms, 256 ms (2!), 384 ms, 512 ms, 768 ms (2!) and 1024 ms for the T1-experiment and 16 ms, 32 ms (2!), 48 ms, 64 ms, 96 ms (2!) and 128 ms for the T1r-experiment. For both experiments, the recycle delay was 1.55 s. The {1H}­15N NOE values were derived from experiments using 3 s either on or off-resonance irradiation in a total recycle delay of 5 s. Additionally, a 12 s delay was executed after acquisition of each complex point. Relaxation dispersion experiments were recorded at 20 8C for 15N-SQ coherence at 11.7 T (duplicate experiments), 14.1 (duplicate experiments) and 18.8 T (triplicate experiments) using a standard constant time relaxation compensated CPMG scheme.55,56 The constanttime value was set to 40 ms and the effective CPMG field strength was set to 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz 500 Hz, 700 Hz, 1000 Hz and 1400 Hz using a 15N 908 pulse of w52 ms. The recycle delay was 2 s. Structure calculations and refinement The NOE peaks were assigned and converted into distance restraints by CYANA v1.05.57,58 Dihedral angle restraints for the j­f angles were derived from N, HN, C 0 , Ca, Cb and Ha chemical shifts using TALOS.59 An initial set of 100 NMR structures was calculated with CYANA and the 70 best structures were subsequently refined in water using a restrained molecular dynamics protocol60,61 to improve local geometry and electrostatics. Of the resulting structures, the 30 lowest energy ° structures with no distance restraint violations O0.5 A or dihedral angle violations O58 were selected to form the final ensemble. The best representative structure (no. 16 of the ensemble) is defined as the structure closest to the mean structure. Structures were analyzed using the programs PROCHECK-NMR62 and WHAT-CHECK.63 Fast time-scale dynamics analysis All spectra were processed and zero filled to a final size of 8K (1H)!4K (15N) points. The longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates were calculated by fitting peak intensities to a mono-exponential decay using the modelXY module of NMRPipe.52 Errors in peak heights were estimated by the RMS of the noise-level. Errors (1s confidence limits) were estimated from 21 Monte Carlo simulations. In a conservative approach, all errors for R1, R1r and NOE were estimated to be at least 3% to prevent falsely attributed contributions of internal motions or exchange. Subsequently, the R1, R1r and NOE values were analyzed using reduced spectral density mapping to describe the motion of the N­H vector in terms of the spectral density at 0, uN and 0.87uH frequencies.35­37 The chemical shift anisotropy of the 15N nucleus was assumed uniform with a value of K170 ppm and the N­H bond ° length was set to 1.02 A. Slow time-scale dynamics analysis All spectra were processed and zero filled to a final size of 8K (1H) !4K (15N) points. The effective R2 was calculated on the basis of peak intensities.55 Uncertainties in peak intensities were based on the RMS of the noiselevel. The dispersion of R2 values was defined as
