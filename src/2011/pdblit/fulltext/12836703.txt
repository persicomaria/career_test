Key words: crystal structure, enzyme, inositol, inositol 1-phosphate synthase, NYSGRC, structural genomics Abstract The New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium has targeted highly conserved but uncharacterized enzyme families for structure determination. As part of this effort, the 2.65-Å crystal structure has been determined for Saccharomyces cerevisiae myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (MIP), an essential enzyme that catalyzes critical steps in inositol biosynthesis. The structure determination of four independent monomers in the asymmetric unit (240 kDa) reveals atomic details and residue composition for the partially closed NAD-containing active sites in apo-configuration. The structure further reveals extensive interactions involved in tetrameric assembly of the enzyme complex. Introduction Biosynthesis of inositol compounds requires the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate through a 3-step mechanism catalyzed by the enzyme myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (MIP) [1]. Inositol-containing metabolites serve many diverse roles in the cell from second messenger signaling to phospholipid biogenesis[2, 3]. Saccharomyces cerevisiae myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase is an essential gene in yeast and cells containing deletion mutants for this gene are unable to grow in the absence of an external inositol source [4]. The New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium (NYSGRC, www.nysgrc.org) has targeted highly conserved enzyme families for structure determination as part of the national effort in structural genomics. At the time, MIP represented a highly conserved protein family with little structural information, so it was selected as a target for crystallographic structure determination as part of the NYSGRC structural genomics project. Structural analysis of the S. cerevisiae MIP protein reveals it is comprised of at least two domains, an ­ domain that contains the active site NAD cofactor, and two distinct regions of the protein that are involved in the tetrameric architecture of the enzyme complex. Although solved in the apo-state, conserved amino acid residues surrounding the NAD cofactor are observed in open and partially closed configurations, revealing an active site that is likely reorganized upon ligand binding and product formation.

Materials and methods Isolation, expression, crystallization and structure determination MIP was selected as a unique target for our structural genomics effort by virtue of its highly distributed and conserved sequence. The coding region for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MIP enzyme was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR, ligated into a modified version of pET28b, expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 Codon Plus RIL (Stratagene), and purified

using Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen). The MIP enzyme was further purified by gel filtration (Superdex200, Pharmacia), eluting with an apparent molecular weight consistent with a tetramer. Fractions were

analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated to 6.4 mg/ml (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L DTT). Selenomethionine-substituted

ScMIP was generated by expressing ScMIP in DL41(DE3) cells [10]. Ninety-six-well crystallization trials were conducted that produced diffraction quality crystals. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted ScMIP protein crystals were refined and grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion against a well solution containing 7% PEG 4K, 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 5% glycerol to a final size of 0.2 0.2 0.3 mm. The data presented here were obtained from SeMet ScMIP crystallized in space group P2 12 12 (a 155.7 Å, b 187.3 Å, c 100.0 Å, 90°). Diffraction data collection was accomplished using cryopreserved crystals (30% glycerol in mother liquor). Crystals were diffracted at beamline X9A at the National Synchrotron Light Source, processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK [11], and input to SOLVE, RESOLVE [12], and the CCP4 suite [13] to calculate a 2.8 Å SAD phase set. RESOLVE automatically determined one of the two-fold NCS operators relating AB and CD dimers within MIP, and this solvent modified-NCS averaged electron density was manually traced using 14O (See Table I) and the model was refined using NCS restraints in CNS [15]. The protomer model was initially fit into the 4 respective positions within the asymmetric unit using BRUTPTF [16]. The model contained 2056 amino

acid residues (from a possible 2132 amino acids, 533 per protomer) excluding the N-terminal 10 amino acids from each protomer, and amino acids 366 to 374. One region of each protomer contains residues that lie in generously allowed and disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. These include Asp320 and Asp321, residues in a loop that is in direct contact with the NAD cofactor. Similar geometry was observed in the prerelease MIP coordinates from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [7]. Coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1LA2). Additional information on the expression and crystallization of ScMIP can be found at www.nysgrc.org under target identification code T23.

Results and Discussion Structure of S. cerevisiae MIP S. cerevisiae MIP was expressed, purified, crystallized and characterized by X-ray crystallography (see Methods). The structure of the MIP protomer (amino acid residues 1­533) includes a NAD containing ­ fold that is roughly comprised of amino acid residues 66­322, although residues are contributed to this domain from the C-terminal portion of the peptide (Fig-

ure 1). The structure reveals a 222-tetrameric organization between the protomers, an oligomer state observed in solution [1] (see Methods). The oligomer interface is mainly comprised of two protomer regions. One interface involves contacts between N-terminal and C-terminal residues in MIP AB or CD dimers. The other major interface involves four

-strands from each of the protomers that together form an extended 16-stranded -sheet sandwich (Figure 1). The -sheet from each protomer is comprised of amino acid residues 345­437. The AB and CD protomers each combine to form an 8-stranded mixed -sheet, with the central 6 strands (3 from each protomer) arranged with 2-fold symmetry in antiparallel

orientation. The outer strands of the 8-stranded mixed -sheet from each protomer are arranged in parallel orientation to the interior antiparallel -sheet. The interfacial regions within the 222 protomer are primarily hydrophobic in nature. The calculated total buried accessible surface area between either AB or CD protomers was approximately 13000 Å [5], while the tetrameric interaction observed between the AB and CD dimers buries approximately 8400 Å [5] of total accessible surface area compared with AB or CD alone [5]. Crystallographic analysis for both M. tuberculosis (MtMIP) and S. cerevisiae (ScMIP) MIP proteins were reported recently [6, 7]. Both structure de-

terminations revealed a similar tetrameric arrangement of protomers, although in each case the tetramer was observed across crystallographic axes. Although below sequence detection level using standard methods, MIP shares similarities to several structures in the PDB database as calculated with the program DALI [8]. The top three scoring matches include similarity to MIP across amino acids 54­482 (diaminopimilate dehydrogenase, 203 residue 7% sequence identity alignment, PDB code 1dap), amino acids 52­453 (biliverdin reductase, 185 residue 11% sequence identity alignment, PDB code 1gcu), and amino acids 53­416 (homoserine dehydrogenase, 155

134 residue 10% sequence identity alignment, PDB code 1ebu). Functional similarities between these proteins and MIP are primarily localized to the ­ fold that contains the NAD cofactor and respective active sites for each of these proteins. Automated homology modeling with MODPIPE [9] using MIP as a template yielded 74 models when a strict criterion was applied. S. cerevisiae MIP active site As observed in other NAD-containing enzymes, ScMIP coordinates the NAD cofactor within an ­ fold, orienting the nicotinamide ring at the base of a solvent-exposed pocket where it would be available to contribute its chemistry to the biosynthesis of myoinositol 1-phosphate (Figure 2). A large conformational change for this enzyme was reported recently in a report that describes ScMIP in both apo- and NADH 2-deoxy-blucitol-6-phosphate inhibitor bound states [6]. This report suggested that over 50 amino acid residues around the active site (352­409) were disordered, and that only upon inhibitor binding did these polypeptide regions become ordered. Our structural analysis reveals a higher degree of order in this region, even in the absence of any inhibitor or substrate. Our structure reveals that only 10 residues (365­375) are disordered, suggesting that the dramatic conformational changes observed in the previous study were due to transitions that occur between the enzyme in apo- and NAD/NADH complexes. The approaches described here have elucidated the X-ray structure for Saccharomyces cerevisiae myoinositol 1-phosphate synthase, an essential enzyme in the inositol biosynthesis pathway, revealing the structural basis for the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in inositol biosynthesis. The results suggest that the enzyme has four independent NAD-containing active sites located within a unique tetrameric architecture. Observation of the active site in its apoform reveals the atomic detail for highly conserved residues within the family. In addition, several highly conserved residues within a loop between residues 366 and 374 are not observed in the electron density, indicating that these residues may form a lid over the active site during catalysis.
