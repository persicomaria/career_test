The X-ray structure of recombinant bovine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which speci®cally catalyzes the cleavage of the sn-2 acylester bond of phospholipids, has been Ê re®ned at 1.5 A resolution. The crystal belongs to the space group P212121 with unit-cell parameters a = 47.12, b = 64.59 Ê and c = 38.14 A similar to the native enzyme reported previously by Dijkstra et al. [J. Mol. Biol. (1981), 147, 97±123]. The re®nement converged to an R value of 18.4% (Rfree = Ê 22.8%) for 16 374 re¯ections between 10.0 and 1.5 A resolution. The surface-loop residues (60±70) are ordered in the present orthorhombic recombinant enzyme, but disordered in the trigonal recombinant enzyme. The active-site residues, His48, Asp99, and the catalytic water superimpose well with the trigonal form. Besides the catalytic water which is hydrogen bonded to His48, it is often seen that there is a second water attached to the same N atom of His48 and simultaneously hydrogen bonded to the O atom of Asp49. It is thought that the second water facilitates the tautomerism of His48 for enzyme catalysis. The catalytic water is also hydrogen bonded to the equatorial water coordinated to the calcium ion. In addition to the equatorial water, there is also an axial calcium water and the additional structural water. These ®ve common water molecules are hydrogen bonded to the additional 16 water molecules in the present orthorhombic structure which may further enhance the structural integrity of the active site. Besides the protein and one calcium ion, a total of 134 water molecules were located in the present highresolution re®nement.

1. Introduction
Bovine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a 14 kDa enzyme, containing 123 amino-acid residues. The enzyme is cross-linked by seven disul®de bonds, conserved in about 40 species of secretory PLA2s, which endows it with exceptional stability (Davidson & Dennis, 1990). The enzyme PLA2 displays a high degree of structural homology for the binding of glycerophospholipids and speci®cally hydrolyzes its sn-2 acylester bond. Apparently the wild-type bovine pancreatic PLA2 readily crystallizes in the orthorhombic form (Dijkstra et al., 1981), while the recombinant PLA2 crystallizes in both the orthorhombic (present work) and trigonal forms (Noel et al., 1991; Sekar et al., 1998). The ®rst crystal structure of PLA2 from bovine pancreas was determined in the orthorhombic Ê form at 1.7 A resolution (Dijkstra et al., 1981). Since 1989, we have been studying the trigonal crystal form of the recombinant enzyme (Noel et al., 1991). During our work on the trigonal form, we stumbled across the orthorhombic form, which diffracted to a very high resolution. We collected the

2. Materials and methods
Recombinant bovine pancreatic PLA2 was kindly supplied by Dr M.-D. Tsai of the Chemistry Department. Crystals were grown within a week at room temperature (291 K) by the hanging-drop method from droplets containing 5 ml of the protein (15 mg mlÀ1), 5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.2, and 3 ml of MPD (50%). The reservoir MPD concentration was 50%. For data collection, a crystal of size 0.3 Â 0.3 Â 0.5 mm was mounted in a quartz capillary with mother liquor

at both ends and sealed. The crystal unit-cell parameters of the Ê recombinant PLA2, a = 47.12, b = 64.59 and c = 38.14 A, space Ê 3 DaÀ1 are similar to those of the group P212121, Vm = 2.1 A Ê wild-type enzyme (a = 47.08, b = 64.44 and c = 38.15 A) (Dijkstra et al., 1981). The X-ray intensity data were collected at room temperature (291 K) on our R-axis IIc image plate with a Rigaku rotating Cu anode operating at 50 kV and Ê 100 mA (! = 1.5418 A). The crystal-to-detector distance was 55 mm. Each frame was exposed for 25 min and oscillated by 3 . Altogether, 68 591 observations were made which yielded 17 572 [F ! 1'(F)] unique re¯ections in the resolution range Ê 10.0±1.5 A with an Rmerge of 4.6%. The data completeness Ê between 10.0 and 1.5 A was 92% (Table 1). The re®nement was started with the atomic coordinates of the orthorhombic wild-type structure (Dijkstra et al., 1981) È using X-PLOR version 3.1 (Brunger, 1992a) on a Silicon Graphics workstation. 7% (1198 out of 17 572) of the re¯ecÈ tions were used for the calculation of Rfree (Brunger, 1992b). Ê The remaining re¯ections in the resolution range 10.0±1.5 A were used throughout the re®nement. 50 cycles of rigid-body re®nement and 50 cycles of Powell energy minimization on atomic positions lowered the R factor to 33.0% (Rfree = 35.4%). Next, simulated annealing was performed, slow cooling from 4000 to 300 K in steps of 25 K, followed by re®nement of positional and individual isotropic temperature factors, giving an R factor of 26.2% (Rfree = 29.6%). The protein model was ®tted into the difference electron-density maps by the molecular-modeling program FRODO (Jones, 1985). The water molecules were picked from jFo j À jFc j difference electron-density maps. These water peaks were also

checked using the 2jFo j À jFc j difference electron-density maps and were included in the re®nement in stages. In this manner, 134 water molecules were located. Omit electrondensity maps showed no residual electron densities which could be interpreted as buffer or MPD molecules used in the crystallization. At the end of the ®nal re®nement, the R factor converged to 18.4% (Rfree = 22.8%) for 16 374 re¯ections in Ê the resolution range 10.0±1.5 A. The ®nal protein model contains 957 non-H atoms (123 residues), one Ca2+ ion and 134 water O atoms. The quality of the protein model was very good as assessed by the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). A Ramachandran plot showed that all the 9Y 2 angles are in the most favored regions. A Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) indicated Ê an estimated error of 0.19 A in the atomic coordinates. A summary of the re®ned model and the relevant geometrical parameters are given in Table 2. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparison with the earlier structures

The overall fold of the re®ned recombinant PLA2 is similar to the orthorhombic wild type (Dijkstra et al., 1981). The backbone atoms superimpose with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) Ê deviation of 0.15 A while all the atoms, including the sideÊ chain atoms, superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.85 A. The largest deviations are in the three side chains of Arg43, Lys113 and Lys121 (Fig. 1) and the overall r.m.s. deviation Ê reduces to 0.59 A if these residues are omitted. A total of 134 water molecules were located in the present re®nement compared with 106 in the earlier report (Dijkstra et al., 1981); of these, 73 are Ê within 1.0 A of each other. Most of the 134 water molecules are in the ®rst hydration sphere of the protein while only 12 are in the second hydration sphere. About half the ®rst hydration-sphere water molecules are hydrogen bonded to the peptide backbone atoms while the remaining are hydrogen bonded to the side-chain atoms (Thanki et al., 1988). The backbone atoms superimpose on the trigonal form (Sekar et al., 1998) with an r.m.s. Ê deviation of 0.73 A; including the side-chain Ê atoms, the r.m.s. deviation is 1.40 A. The disorder of the surface loop in the trigonal structure is responsible for the large deviation. Ê In fact, the r.m.s. deviation reduces to 0.43 A for the backbone atoms, if the surface-loop residues are omitted. There are 40 water Ê molecules within 1.0 A in the present orthorhombic and trigonal forms.
3.2. The surface loop

Figure 2

The electron density of the 85 atoms of the surface-loop residues (60±70) is clear and ordered (Fig. 2a). Indeed, the average B value Ê for the surface loop is 18.6 A2 in the orthorÊ hombic form, while it is 58.3 A2 in the trigonal form. The volume per Dalton of the orthorÊ hombic form (2.1 A3) is less than that of the Ê trigonal form (2.24 A3) by 8%. This indicates that the orthorhombic form is more tightly packed than the trigonal form. There are 12 symmetry-related molecules involved in interÊ molecular contacts ( 3.6 A) in the orthorhombic form while there are only eight in the trigonal form (Fig. 3). Four of the 12 are involved in close contacts with the surface-loop residues whereas only two are involved in the

trigonal form. Thus, the larger number of intermolecular contacts in the orthorhombic form may be responsible for the ordering of the surface loop. However, in the orthorhombic mutants, Q4E (Liu et al., 1995), Y52 and 73F/D99N (Sekar et al., 1997), solved so far, the surface loop is disordered. This could mean that the packing may not entirely explain the ordering of the surface loop. The orthorhombic high-resolution structure has 18 water molecules surrounding the ordered surface loop, compared with only seven in the trigonal structure. The 18 water molecules make 22 hydrogen bonds with the backbone and the side chains (Fig. 2b), while only seven hydrogen bonds are found in the trigonal structure. To what extent the water molecules contribute to the ordering of the surface loop in the orthorhombic structure is not clear.
3.3. Active-site water molecules

The active-site cleft consists of the commonly found ®ve water molecules: the catalytic water W6, a second water W7 hydrogen bonded to the same imidazole N1 atom of histidine, the two calcium-coordinated water molecules (equatorial W5 and axial W12), and the conserved structural water W11 (Fig. 4). The His48 water molecules subtend an angle of 69 at N1 and we conjecture that the water molecule W7 could be Figure 3 assisting the catalytic water W6 in the tautomerization of A stereoview of the packing diagram showing the reference molecule His48 for enzyme catalysis. Like the catalytic water hydrogen (thick lines) and the symmetry-related molecules (thin lines) in (a) the bonded to the equatorial calcium water, the second water W7 orthorhombic and (b) the trigonal forms with the surface loop highlighted. is hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate O1 atom of Asp49, which is coordinated to the calcium. In the serine proteases (Fujinaga & James, 1987; Teplyakov et al., 1990), besides serine which replaces the catalytic water, another water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the catalytic histidine, corresponding to the second water molecule in PLA2, which may have a similar role. The equatorial water W5 bridging the catalytic water and the calcium ion is in the interior of the protein and has a low temperature factor Ê (10.2 A2). On the other hand, the axially coordinated calcium water W12 is exposed to the solvent channel and has a higher temperature Ê factor (19.6 A2). The equatorial calcium water is hydrogen bonded to eight other water molecules of the active site forming a branch. The axial water is connected to the second histidine water W7 through a water molecule which is hydrogen bonded to the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr69 (Fig. 5). This water is hydrogen bonded to a string of six water molecules. The conserved structural water, W11, is hydrogen bonded to the active-site residues and to two other water molecules that are linked together on the surface of the enzyme (Fig. Figure 4 A stereoview of the hydrogen-bonding (dashed lines) network connecting the active/ 5). Therefore, on one end of the catalytic dyad catalytic site and the calcium coordination sphere. The omit electron-density map shows (Asp99±His48) is the catalytic water and the the ®ve water molecules commonly found in the active site: the structural water (W11), equatorial calcium water, and on the other end is the two calcium-coordinated waters (W5 and W12), the catalytic water (W6) and the second water (W7).
