Abstract Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes from snake venoms are approximately 14 kDa secretory proteins and catalyze the release of arachidonic acid which is the precursor of proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes and plateletactivating factors. The structure of the PLA2 enzyme purified from the venom of Daboia russelli pulchella was determined using molecular ° replacement method and refined to an R value of 18.3% for all the reflections to 1.8 A resolution. The structure contains two crystallographically independent molecules A and B which form an asymmetric homodimer. The Ca2+ ion was not detected in the present structure, however, a characteristic non-protein high quality electron density was observed at the substrate-binding site of molecule A which allowed a clear interpretation of a natural ligand identified as a derivative of indole, 2-carbamoylmethyl-5-propyl-octahydro-indol-7-yl)acetic acid. The corresponding substrate-binding site in molecule B was empty. The ligand present in molecule A is involved in extensive interactions with the protein atoms including important catalytic residues such as Asp-49 and His-48. The results also show that the indole derivatives act as potent inhibitors of secretory group II PLA2 enzymes that can be further modified to be used as potential therapeutic agents.

kDa and contains approximately 120 amino acid residues with seven disulfide bridges. It has been purified from a variety of sources including mammalian pancreas, spleen, lung, platelets, serum and synovial fluid, as well as reptile and insect venoms. The clinical studies have shown elevated levels of PLA2 activity in synovial fluid, serum and bronchial lavage fluid of patients with arthritis, endotoxic shock, peritonitis, psoriasis, acute pancreatitis and respiratory distress [2,3]. It indicates that the potent inhibitors of secretory PLA2 will be therapeutically useful drugs in the treatment of various inflammatory disorders. Structural information has been successfully used for drug design and development against several target proteins [4­ 7]. Although various PLA2s are present in different sources but they are closely related isoforms. They may differ in pharmacological properties but possess an almost identical

substrate-binding site and enzymatic mechanism. Because of their similar mode of inhibitor binding, the PLA2s from different sources can be used for the design of potent inhibitors. It is also important to synthesize the ligands against various isoforms so that the widely effective drugs could be developed. It may also be helpful to study the structures of PLA2s from venom sources as they contain a variety of isoforms which are often stored in the venoms as inactive complexes with endogenous ligands. The identification of such potent ligands may provide new lead molecules for the drug discovery against inflammatory disorders. It may be mentioned here that the structures of human secretory and non-secretory phospholipase A2s in complexes with a few indole derivatives are known so far [8]. The crystal structure of human secretory phospholipase A2IIA bound to a novel potent indolizine inhibitor has been determined [9]. The crystal structure of the bee venom PLA2 complexed with phosphonate transition state analogues have also been studied [10]. Automated docking experiments [11,12] with substituted indole derivatives have been carried out with human secretory PLA2. The studies indicate that different classes of indole derivatives are involved in the inhibition of PLA2s in the venoms [13,14]. The indole derivatives were identified from the venoms of toad [13], marine chameleon [14] and the cerebospinal fluid from humans [15]. In order to obtain new and potent inhibitors, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of an inactive PLA2 which was isolated and purified from the venom of Daboia russelli pulchella (DRP). The structure determination revealed the presence of a molecule of 2-carbamoylmethyl-5-propyl-octahydroindol-7-yl)-acetic acid to be called hereafter as indole. The inhibitor appears to be potent because several interactions have been observed between the enzyme and the ligand. The results of the detailed structure analysis of the complex are reported here.

mM ammonium carbonate (pH 10.5) was used at the same flow rate to elute fractions containing phospholipase A2 activity. The fractions containing PLA2 were pooled, dialyzed against ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) and then concentrated using Amicon ultrafiltration unit. Further, it was loaded on to a cation exchanger SP Sephadex C-25 column (8 Â 2.5 cm), which was pre-equilibrated with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.5). A linear gradient of NaCl (0.0 M ­ 0.5 M) in the same buffer was used. The fractions showing PLA2 activity eluted at 0.25 M were pooled, dialyzed and lyophilized. The purity of the sample was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) which showed a single band corresponding to a molecular weight of ¨14 kDa. 2.2. Dynamic light scattering The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were made at different concentrations of the protein. The solutions were prepared in sodium cacodylate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.0) prepared with deionized water from a Millipore Alpha-Q system. The samples were filtered through 0.1 Am polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore). The enzyme concentrations were varied from 0.5 to 20 mg/ ml at a constant temperature of 298 K. Samples were manually injected into the flow cell (50 Al) and illuminated by a 25 W, 600 nm solid state laser. Data were collected three times for each measurement and analyzed using the software package described by Schulze [16]. 2.3. Crystallization The crystals of PLA2 were obtained by the sitting-drop vapour diffusion method. The protein was dissolved at a concentration of 15 mg/ml in 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mM calcium chloride and 3% dioxane. It was equilibrated against the same buffer containing 1.2 M ammonium sulphate. Crystals grew after 2 months of incubation at 298 K. 2.4. MALDI-TOF of crystal samples The crystals of the homodimer were washed with 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0. Then, the crystals were dried and dissolved in distilled water to attain an approximate concentration of 10 mg/ml. The mass spectrometric analysis was carried out with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) (KRATOS, Shimadzu, Japan). Prior to the acquisition of spectra, 100 Al of the solution was mixed with 100 Al of 0.2% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. 1 Al of the acidified solution was spotted onto a stainless steel sample slide followed by 1 Al of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) matrix solution (10 mg/ml) in 50:50 ethanol/water containing 0.1% trifluroacetic acid.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Purification of DPLA2 Purification was carried out utilizing crude venom obtained from Irula Snake Catchers Industrial Society Limited, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India. Approximately 300 mg of lyophilized venom was dissolved in deionized water to a concentration of 10 mg/ml and centrifuged at 8000Âg for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and loaded onto a Affi-Gel Blue column (15 Â 2 cm), which was pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min to remove unbound proteins and then washed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) to remove unspecifically bound proteins. Finally, a third buffer 20

2.5. X-ray intensity data collection and processing The X-ray intensity data collection was carried out at low temperature after stabilizing the crystals in 15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. A crystal of dimensions 0.5 Â 0.4 Â 0.2 mm3 was mounted on a nylon loop and flash-frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffrac° tion data were collected in-house to 1.8 A resolution using CuKa wavelength from a rotating anode X-ray generator (Rigaku, RU-300) and a MAR 345 mm imaging plate scanner. The complete data set was obtained using only one crystal. The DENZO and SCALEPACK packages [17] were used for the determination of unit cell parameters, data processing and scaling of the data. The crystals belong to orthorhombic space group C2221 with unit cell ° ° ° parameters, a = 76.0 A , b = 88.4 A and c = 78.1 A corresponding to two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The data collection and processing parameters are summarized in Table 1. 2.6. Structure determination and refinement The structure was determined by molecular replacement method using AMoRe program [18] incorporated in the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994). The previously determined structure of PLA2 ° at 1.9 A resolution [19] was used as a search model. Both the rotation and translation function searches gave two clear peaks. Rigid-body refinement of the resulting model gave a correlation coefficient of 54% and R factor of 42% ° in the 10.0­ 3.5 A resolution range. The presence of two molecules with a molecular weight of 13598 Da each gave ° a V M parameter of 2.4 A3 DaÀ1 and a solvent content of 48% [20]. The structure was initially refined using 20 cycles of rigid-body refinement and then with REFMAC5 [21] from the CCP4i v4.2 software suite (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994). This reduced the R factor to 0.31 and R free to 0.35 (5% of the data were used to calculate R free and these were not included in the

refinement). The resolution was increased step-wise to 1.8 ° A. A number of cycles of restrained positional refinement with individual B-factor refinement were carried out. The manual model building of the protein was carried out at each step using 2jF o À F cj and jF o À F cj Fourier and difference Fourier maps with the graphics program FO_ [22] on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. During the refinement, the bond lengths and bond angles were restrained close to the standard values, and restraints were also placed on the planarity of groups and non-bonded contacts as defined by Engh and Huber [23]. The R factor dropped to 0.23 and R free factor to 0.28. 2jF o À F cj and

jF o À F cj maps computed at this stage showed the presence of a non-protein electron density at the substrate-binding site of molecule A. The molecule of 2-carbamoylmethyl-5propyl-octahydro-indol-7-yl acetic acid (to be called hereafter as indole, Fig. 1a) was modeled into it (Fig. 1b). The corresponding region in molecule B was empty. Water molecules were included in the model provided they met the criteria of electron density peaks greater than 3j in jF o À F cj maps and had hydrogen bond partners with appropriate distance and angle geometry. Successive rounds of maximum-likelihood refinement with all data ° to 1.8 A using conjugate-gradient matrices and manual model building improved the model significantly. The model was also checked by calculating a series of omit maps at each stage of refinement. The final R factor and R free factor were 0.183 and 0.237 respectively. The final refinement parameters are given in Table 2.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Molecular association The results of dynamic light scattering experiments gave a mean radius (R H) of 2.71 T 0.08 nm. This value corresponds to the molecular weight of 28 kDa [24,25]. Since the polydispersity value in this estimation was below 15% of the average radii, all PLA2 molecules were present in a single form. This suggests that the PLA2 is present in the solution as a stable dimer. 3.2. Presence of indole in the crystals The molecular mass of the protein from the crystals was determined using MALDI-TOF. In the mass spectra, three

peaks were observed that corresponded to molecular masses of 27496.8, 13887.8 Da and 13611.4 Da. The three peaks corresponded to the dimer, molecule A and molecule B. The molecular mass of the monomer estimated from the amino acid sequence was 13610.6 Da. The amount of excess mass in molecule A was 277.2 Da. This was approximately equal to the molecular mass of one indole molecule (MW = 274.3) calculated from its formula (C15H18N2O3). This suggested that the ligand of molecular mass equivalent to that of indole molecule was present in the crystals. The interpretation of the highly characteristic electron density from structure analysis also indicated it to be an indole molecule. The presence of indole derivatives has been reported in the venoms of snakes, scorpions and spiders [26 ­30]. Thus, a new indole derivative shown in Fig. 1a was recognized at the substrate-binding site of molecule A in the structure of present homodimer. 3.3. Quality of the model The final model consists of 1888 protein atoms from two crystallographically independent PLA2 molecules, 20 indole atoms, two carbonate and one sulfate ions, and 284 water molecules. The electron density in the j2F o À F cj Fourier map was continuous and well defined for both the backbone and side chains of both molecules. A mean temperature ° factor of 27.4 A2 for all protein atoms is close to the value ° obtained from Wilson plot (24.1 A2). The final model has a ° good overall geometry with the r.m.s. deviations of 0.008 A

and 1.4- for bond lengths and bond angles respectively. The overall G factor calculated using the program PROCHECK [31] as a measure of stereochemical quality was 0.1. The Ramachandran plot [32] of the main chain torsion angles indicated that 91.3% of the residues were present in the most allowed regions. The remaining 8.3% residues were found in the additionally allowed regions. 3.4. Overall molecular structure The crystal structure contains two crystallographically independent molecules A and B. They form an asymmetric homodimer (Fig. 2). The gel filtration profile and DLS scattering studies have also indicated that the two molecules are associated in solution as a stable homodimer [33]. The overall size of the dimer was calculated to be approximately ° 48 Â 36 Â 42 A3 and the total interface area between the two ° molecules is found to be nearly 635 A2. The conformations of molecules A and B are essentially similar. The superposition of Ca atoms of two molecules gave an r.m.s. ° deviation of 0.6 A. The three regions in the structure that showed notable variations in the conformations of molecules A and B were calcium binding loop, the h-wing and the C-terminal fragment. The average r.m.s. deviation for

the Ca atoms of these three regions (residues Gly-26-Cys33, Tyr-73-Ala-81 and Pro-121-Cys-133) was more than 1.0 ° A. It is important to note that the side-chain of Trp-31 in molecule A occupies a position corresponding to a wider opening of the substrate-binding channel than that in molecule B in which Trp-31 is oriented towards the channel (Fig. 3). The torsion angles /, w, v 1, v 2,1 and v 2,2 that define the conformation of Trp-31 residue are À71-, 141-, À177-, À106- and 75-, respectively, in molecule A while the corresponding values in molecule B are À123-, 171-, À64-, À80- and 94-, respectively. The most significant differences between the conformations of Trp-31 (A) and Trp-31 (B) are reflected in the values of torsion angles / and v 1 (Fig. 3). It may be mentioned here that the values of torsion angles of Trp-31 in molecule B are more commonly observed than those adopted by Trp-31 (A). Since Trp-31 (A) is present at the interface of the dimer, its observed conformation seems to have been greatly influenced by the dimerization whereas Trp-31 (B) is at the surface of the dimer and hence adopts an optimum conformation that is commonly observed for the side-chain of Trp in peptides and proteins [34]. The dimer is stabilized by a number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. As seen from Fig. 2, the interface has a high concentration of hydrophobic residues. The most significant van der Waals interactions were observed involving Trp-31 of molecule A and Arg-43, Phe-46 and Val-47 of molecule B. As mentioned above, these interactions have induced the observed orientation of the side chain of Trp-31 in molecule A. Since a ligand is present only in molecule A and not in molecule B, the conformation of the binding-site of molecule A is suitable for activity. It also indicates that the conformation of Trp-31 as observed in molecule B is not suitable for the binding of ligands and needs a strong inducing hydrophobic environment of aggregated substrates or molecular association as observed in the present structure. Thus, the dimerization of this PLA2 is responsible for the activity of one of the two molecules. 3.5. Binding of indole with PLA2 The electron density for the indole in molecule A was exceptionally clear and allowed an accurate determination of its atomic positions. Hence, a detailed description of the interactions between PLA2 and the indole molecule could be

site. These also correspond to the most commonly observed interactions in the PLA2-ligand binding mechanism [35 ­ 38]. When the ligand directly interacts with Asp-49 and His48 at the active site, it replaces the catalytically important water molecule that bridges His-48 and Asp-49. In addition to these important interactions, the N1 and O3 atoms of indole make hydrogen bonds with Gly-30 O and Trp-31 N, respectively. The hydrogen bonds are also formed between water molecules and O1, N1, N2, O2 and O3 atoms of indole and help in further stabilizing the structure of the complex (Fig. 4). 3.6. Comparison with other Indolizine derivatives A few other complexes of secretory PLA2s with various derivatives of indole have also been reported. These include complexes of human secretory PLA2 with indolizine inhibitors [9] and human non-pancreatic secretory PLA2s with indole inhibitors [8]. The molecular modeling studies using 188 indole derivatives have examined the importance of various substitutions of indole derivatives [11]. It may be mentioned here that the chemical structure of the present indole molecule is different from those reported earlier [8­ 10]. The data given in Table 1 of publication [10] indicate that the substitutions at different sites of indole rings alter the binding constant significantly. Although the interactions involving the key residue of PLA2 are similar, the orientations of different substituents in the present molecule differ greatly (Fig. 5). A superposition of the Ca atoms of the present structure on other four structures of the complexes of hnpsPLA2 [8] ° gave the average r.m.s. shift of 0.8 A. Generally, the ethanamide group of indole is involved extensively in the formation of hydrogen bonds with the active site residues

made. In contrast, the corresponding region in molecule B was completely empty indicating the absence of the ligand in its substrate-binding site. As seen from Table 3, the binding of the indole with molecule A is stabilized by a large number of hydrogen bonds. It also forms a number of hydrophobic interactions as the walls of the substratebinding channel are dominated by hydrophobic residues such as Leu-2, Leu-3, Phe-5, Ile-9 and Ala-18. The most significant interactions in the enzyme ­inhibitor complex are formed involving the ethanamide group of the indole molecule with His-48 Ny1 and Asp-49 Oy1 at the active

The residue 31 in the present structure is Trp whereas in the hnps-PLA2 structures this residue is Val. The active site residues His-48 and Asp-49 are shown in red.

thus inducing a common conformation for ethanamide group. However, the orientations of the indole ring in the hydrophobic channel of the present PLA2 and that of hnpsPLA2 complexes are slightly different (Fig. 5 and may be responsible for the differences in the binding affinities.

4. Conclusions PLA2 enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester of phospholipids and liberate arachidonic acid for the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. In order to restrict the release of arachidonic acid, a variety of inhibitors of PLA2 have been evaluated. These include phospholipids analogues [39 ­ 41], natural alkaloids [36,42,43], carboxamides [44 ­ 46], fatty acids amides [47 ­ 50], aromatic sulfonamides [51], plant-derived sterols [52,53], bis-carboxylates [54], pyrazoles and short peptides [55,56], vitamin E analogues [57], and indole analogues [8,9,11,58 ­ 63]. Attempts are still going on for the search of potent inhibitors. The search includes identification of new affinity groups in the substrate-binding site as well as the combinations of various complementary chemical groups in the ligands. In this effort, the presence of endogenous ligands complexed with highly potent venom PLA2s can provide new leads. In the present structure, a new class of indole derivative was identified at the substrate-binding of PLA2. The examination of interactions between the enzyme and the ligand reveals a new pattern of intermolecular recognition. A comparison with other indole derivatives shows that it occupies an optimum location in the substratebinding site of PLA2 and shows a higher number of interactions with the enzyme. These results indicate the significance of sites, nature of chemical moiety of substitutions. Thus, the present ligand offers a useful lead for the design of more potent inhibitors of PLA2.
