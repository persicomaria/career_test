Large monoclinic crystals were obtained by dissolving microcrystals and recrystallization using a vapour diffusion-induced pH shift, simultaneous with the lowering of the ionic strength of the drop solution (Hennig, Schlesier, Pfeffer & H6hne, 1990). Purification was performed using citrate/phosphate buffer (Mcllvaine, 1921) and the pH shift was achieved by Tris/HC1 buffer. Crystals belong to space group P2~ with the cell dimensions a = 46.9, b = 75.5, c = 5 0 . 9 A and /3 = 120.5 ° . Rotation data were collected on an imaging plate scanner

MICHAEL HENNIG et al. using synchrotron radiation on the EMBL X11 beamline (DESY, Hamburg). The needle-shaped crystals of dimensions ca 0.3 x 0.3 x 1.5mm were mounted in glass capillaries. To avoid the necessity of rotation through 180 ° for complete data, the crystal was oriented with the c* axis approximately parallel to the rotation axis. Because of the high stability of the crystal, the possibility of its translation in the X-ray beam, the use of short wavelengths and the high intensity of the X-ray source, only one crystal was necessary for the parent protein and for each of the derivatives. A rotation angle of 2 ° was used for each exposure. Two data sets were collected with different exposures. Details on data collection parameters for the parent crystal are summarized in Table 1. The data were processed with the program package MOSFLM (Leslie, Brick & Wonacott, 1986). All the programs used were from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994), unless otherwise stated. The initial orientation matrices were determined from still photographs and refined using the program POSTCHK. The reflections were integrated with the program MOSFLM, using profile fitting. The integrated intensities were scaled with the program ROTAVATA and merged using verted to structure-factor amplitudes using TRUNCATE. The native data are of high quality in all resolution shells. The overall percentage completeness and reflections with intensities greater than three standard deviations are shown as a function of resolution in Fig. 1. Even in the highest resolution range, 80% of the data are greater than 3o. The overall R factor, based on intensities for the symmetry-equivalent reflections for the combined low- and high-resolution data, was 5.6%. In the highest resolution shell of 1.8-1.85/~, Rsymis 7.8% (Fig. 2). 3.2. Derivatives Heavy-atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in the mother liquor containing 0.1 M Tris/HC1 buffer, pH 7.2, and the appropriate heavy-atom compound. Possible derivatives were screened by selecting those crystals which showed no serious damage after soaking. Subsequently, a preliminary data set at 4/~ was collected using synchrotron radiation, which required not more than 3 h total beam time. The derivatives were analysed and data to higher resolution collected, if the derivative proved to be useful. In addition, two derivatives were investigated using a sealed-tube generator (Cu Kc~ radiation). The statistics of the heavy-atom derivative data are summarized in Table 2. The mercury acetate derivative gave very clear anomalous and isomorphous difference Patterson maps, as the wavelength was optimized to just below the absorption edge of mercury (A = 0.95/~, Fig. 3). Two binding sites were identified from the Harker section. The third peak of the Harker section corresponds to a cross vector. The remaining sites of this derivative and all sites of the

181

other derivatives were found by cross-phased difference Fourier syntheses. The refinement of the heavy-atom sites was performed using REFINE and phase calculations with PHARE. The heavy-atom positions and refined parameters are summarized in Table 3. The phasing power of the mercury derivative is exceptionally high, which indicates the tight binding and high isomorphism of this derivative, even at high resolution. In contrast, the samarium and platinum derivatives were relatively poor. A comparison of the phase angles, calculated from the refined structure, shows that the use of only the mercury and uranyl derivatives produced the best phases (mean Aqo = 40 °, Aq0 = qo MIR q0finaimodel, 10--2.2/~ resolution range). In contrast, phasing without these resulted in a very noisy map and a mean A~ of 69 °. The initial figure of merit, calculated using all the derivatives mentioned above, was 0.71 for all reflections between 2.2 and 10/~ resolution (mean Aqo = 43°). The application of solvent flattening (Wang, 1985) did not improve the quality of the electron-density map significantly and, therefore, was not used in model building.
-

3.3. Model building and refinement MIR-phases based on all derivatives were used to calculate a map weighted according to the figure of merit. Data were limited to the resolution range 2.2-8/~. The electron density was plotted in steps of 0.8or, starting at 1.2cr on Plexiglas sheets. Several strands could be easily recognized, but large parts of the molecule remained unclear. Some Ca positions were labelled and used as a marker on a graphics station. All further work was performed using the FRODO software package (Jones, 1985) on Evans & Sutherland PS300 and later ESV30 graphics display systems. In the first step of electrondensity interpretation, only alanine and glycine residues were built in regions where a continuous chain was visible. The chain directions defined by the carbonyl O atoms were unclear in many cases, but in retrospect, only three of the ten segments were traced in the wrong direction. After refinement of the partial model using the restrained least-squares procedure (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980) implemented in PROLSQ, a phase combination of the model and MIR phases was performed using the program COMBINE (Bricogne, 1976). The incompleteness of the model (ca 50% of all atoms) was taken into account by lowering the weight of the model contribution. The resulting slightly improved electron density was used to correct misfit parts of the model and to extend it. After several cycles of model building, refinement of the model, phase combination and recalculation of the electron density, the molecule was extended considerably and several side chains identified. After step.8 of the refinement, Fourier synthesis using data to 1.8 A resolution based on the coefficients (2Fo - F c ) x exp(iotc) was used simultanously with the combined map for manual rebuilding. The N-terminus and two

NARBONIN but we have no explanation for its unusual geometry. His219 lies close to the aL section and, like Phe253, at the start of an a / f l - l o o p (Table 6). Fig. 6 shows a representative part of the structure with the electron density superimposed, displaying the high quality of the map. The plot of the R factor as a function of resolution is shown in Fig. 7, together with the lines for a series of theoretical coordinate errors (Luzzati, 1952). It allows a rough estimation of the mean coordinate error, which can be much lower or higher in different parts of the molecule. The deviation at low resolution is caused by the relatively poor model for the bulk solvent structure. 4.2. Comparison o f the X-ray sequence and the c D N A
sequence

further internal peptides (overall, 17% of the residues), which were chemically sequenced, could be located in the molecule. An automated refinement procedure (ARP) was applied at a crystallographic R factor of 30.1% for all data in the resolution range 1.8-10 A. The method and its application to narbonin is published elsewhere (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993). ARP led to a substantial improvement of the electron density and the model was rebuilt in several parts of the molecule, according to the features of the ARP map. Two further cycles of application of ARP and manual rebuilding using interactive graphics led to the preliminary refined narbonin structure with most of the side chains identified (Hennig, Schlesier, Dauter, Pfeffer, Betzel, H6hne & Wilson 1992). After the cDNA-derived amino-acid sequence became available, the model was corrected and some more water molecules added. The interpretation was carried out using (3Fo 2Fc) and ( F o - F¢) electron-density maps. In order to find the positions of water molecules, the highest positive peaks in the (Fo - Fc) difference Fourier map were located using the program P E A K M A X and water molecules were placed at these maxima, if they were in a geometrically reasonable position. Subsequently, two further steps of refinement were performed. In summary, the refinement was carried out in 16 steps comprising 110 cycles of least-squares minimization, Table 4.

4. Structure of narbonin
4.1. Quality o f the structure

The refined model of narbonin contains 289 of the 290 residues and 513 water molecules. The backbone atoms of all residues, except the C-terminal Arg290 which is disordered and, therefore, not included in the model, have well defined electron density. Nevertheless, some of the side chains could not be fully modelled because of disorder and weak or missing density. Thus, Lys289 was traced as an alanine. Further poorly defined residues can be recognized by their high B values. These parts of the molecule are the N- and three C-terminal residues and the side chains of Glu29, Arg73, Arg135, Lys214, Arg271 and Asp272. Regions of weak electron density correspond to positions with high thermal-motion parameters (Fig. 4). In the main-chain B-factor plot (Fig. 4), the N- as well as the C-terminal and fl/a-loop regions with B factors > 30 A 2 can be identified. In contrast, all eight parallel fl-strands have low temperature factors. The R factor, based on 27 227 observed structure factors between 10 and 1.8 A resolution, is 15.9%. The r.m.s, deviation from ideal bond length is 0.015 ]k and from ideal bond angles is 3.1 °. Further stereochemical and crystallographic data of the refined narbonin structure are given in Table 4. The go, ~b plot of the final model (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) is presented in Fig. 5 and shows only two residues outside the allowed regions. Tyr216 lies directly at the end of a-helix 6,

Comparison of the sequence derived by interpretation of the electron density at 1.8 A resolution and cDNAderived amino-acid sequence is shown in Fig. 8. The alignment of the sequences shows general agreement. Only 49 of the 290 amino acids (17%) were determined before publication of the X-ray sequence by peptide sequencing. In the remaining polypeptide chain, 203 of the 241 residues were correctly identified by Xray sequencing (84.2%), a high quota compared with earlier trials of X-ray sequencing (Colman, Jansonius & Matthews, 1972; Herriott, Watenpaugh, Sieker & Jensen 1973). In addition, no renumbering of the residues was necessary, because the cDNA-derived sequence has no deletions or insertions compared with the X-ray sequence. Nevertheless, at this resolution it is difficult to distinguish between O, N and C atoms in X-ray crystallography, because of their similar atomic form factors and small difference in bond length. This results in difficulties in distinguishing between Asn, Asp and Leu, as well as between Gin and Glu and between Thr and Val. On the other hand, there are differences in the environment of the amino-acid side chains. For instance, valine and leucine are hydrophobic and do not form hydrogen bonds. In addition, the conformation

MICHAEL HENNIG et al. of the leucine side chain differs significantly from Asn and Asp. The X-ray sequencing includes Asn and Asp together (Asx or B in one letter code) and Leu separately. Only the residue Leu287 was inaccurately identified as Asx. For glutamine and glutamic acid, Glx or Z were used in the X-ray sequence. Only for clearly identified salt bridges were Asp or Glu included in the sequence, which turned out to be correct in all cases. The differentiation between valine and threonine, based on differences in the environment of the residues, was less successful. Eight of the 35 Val/Thr residues were mismatched. This supports the unusual property of narbonin having hydrophobic residues accessible to solvent, because seven of the eight residues identified as Thr in the X-ray sequence and turned out to be Val, have

their position on the protein surface exposed to solvent. A comparison of the correct identification of the residues by amino-acid type is shown in Fig. 9. All the aromatic and hydrophobic side chains of Trp, Tyr, Phe, Pro, Ala, Gly and Cys were identified correctly by interpretation of the highly accurate electron-density distribution of these side chains. On the other hand, the hydrophilic and charged amino acids are more difficult to identify. Especially the flexible Lys and Arg side chains were often wrongly sequenced, if they are not stabilized by ionic interactions. Even with the knowledge of the sequence, it is not possible to trace the side chains of some residues because of disorder. The single methionine could not be found, because of its two conformations. For the estimation of the reliability and quality of Xray structures and their correct tracing in the electron density, several factors, including temperature factor, real-space correlation coefficient, solvent accessibility etc., for every atom or residue, have been used in protein crystallography. We introduced a probability factor to

NARBONIN the barrel is formed not only by hydrophobic side chains. The charges of the two polar residues Arg6 and Asp 189 are compensated by forming a salt bridge. In addition, Arg6 forms hydrogen bonds to OG of Ser163, Wat8 and His34. There are two internal waters (Wat8 and Wat49), forming hydrogen bonds to surrounding main-chain and side-chain atoms (Fig. 12). They have B factors of 8.0 and 8.4 A 2, respectively, which are in the same range as surrounding protein atoms. Asp128 forms hydrogen bonds to OH of Tyr8, to OG of Ser83 and Ser163 and the water molecule Wat49. The side chains of the parallel /3-strands which point into the centre of the barrel form four layers (for details, see Hennig, Schlesier, Dauter,

estimate the certainty of the correct identification of the side chain. A low factor was used to indicate substantial disorder in the electron density, allowing no identification at all and the highest number 9 indicates well ordered side-chain density with high confidence in the interpretation. The result in Fig. 10 shows the high conformity of this estimation with reality by counting the number of wrongly identified amino acids for each probability factor. This confirms that it is possible to indicate the correctness of structure determination in protein crystallography of every atom or residue by careful consideration of the quality factors, especially the electron-density distribution. 4.3. Overall structure The narbonin molecule consists of a parallel ~3~abarrel domain having the dimensions ca 45 x 45 x 30,~,. A schematic cartoon of the structure is shown in Fig. 11. The positions, length and mean qo, ~ angles of helices and /3-strands are summarized in Table 5. The comparison of the fold with other /3/a-barrel proteins for which three-dimensional crystal structures have been determined so far shows some differences. The Nterminal region of the chain shows most differences. The first and second /3-strands are connected by an extended loop comprising two /3-turns. However, the B factors of the main-chain atoms are not significantly higher in this region without regular secondary structure compared with the neighbouring helices. The second strand (/32) extends almost without interruption of the /3-sheet hydrogen-bonding network and the /3-strand conformation angles (qo, ~b) to an antiparallel /3-sheet motif being on the top of a-helices a3 and a4. This structural element is formed by the ~'- and/3"-strands and does not cover the C-terminal entrance of the /3barrel. It follows the a/fl/a folding pattern found in all TIM-barrel proteins. Short secondary-structural elements are additionally found in the loop regions between strands and helices at the top of the molecule and between helices and strands at the bottom. In several TIM-barrel proteins there is an additional helix found in the loop before helix 8, promoting the binding of phosphate because of its macrodipole moment. In narbonin, a turn of type III (310-helix) is situated here and there is a short a-helix in the neighbouring loop before helix 7. The N-termini of both helices are adjacent. Between a3 and f14 there is a hairpin structure (Fig. 15). 4.4. Parallel/3-barrel and fl/a loop regions The /3-barrel in narbonin is constructed from 46 residues and is elliptical with maximum cross sections 13 x 18,~,. Most of the ,g-strands consist of six residues, only/33 is longer with eight residues and/35, /36 and /38 are shorter (Table 5). The /3-strands of the barrel form 44 main-chain hydrogen bonds.

Pfeffer, Betzel, Htihne & Wilson, 1992). The C-terminal entrance of the barrel is of special interest, because all c~//~-barrel structures known to date have their active site situated in this region of the structure. The entrance shows a pocket formed by the loop regions between the /3-strands of the barrel and the following o~-helices. This top region of the barrel is subdivided by the side chain of Trp261 into two parts, a more hydrophilic cavity filled by eight solvent molecules and a hydrophobic pocket pointing towards the antiparallel 13-sheet. A schematic drawing of the conformation of the loops and the most striking side chains making up the C-terminal entrance of the barrel is shown in Fig. 13. The cavity is closed by a

salt bridge formed by Arg87, Asp231 and Glu 132. These side chains are very well defined in electron density, Fig. 6. Three/3/a-loop regions are held in their observed conformations, fl3cz3 by Arg87, fl4o~4 by Glu134 and c/, which is in the loop/5'7a7, by Asp231. The salt bridge is accessible to solvent and makes up the bottom of a flat groove on the surface of the molecule. The surface is closed completely and there is no channel between the solution and the internal cavity. On the other hand, in the derivative structures there is an Hg or Pt atom (at almost the same position) located in the cavity. The mercury derivative structure was refined to an R factor of 17.4% for all reflections between 2.1 and 10A resolution, to allow a detailed analysis of its binding sites. An Hg atom binds to His l30 (the other three mercury-binding sites are Cys246, His133 and His173) without major distortion of the surrounding structure. Only the side chain of Arg87 moves significantly, but without breaking the salt bridge (Fig. 14). The hydrophobic pocket is formed mainly by side chains of the C-terminal end of [~1 (Tyr8 and Val 11) and the beginning of/3' (Phe39 and Ile41 ). On the top of the loops there are two hydrophobic residues, Va189 from the fl3c~3 loop and Leu230 from the t~'-helix in the/~7c~7 loop [Fig. 13(b)]. The side chains are completely exposed to solvent and reject all water molecules in a sphere of 3.5 A. 4.5. a/t3-loop regions Many ~/fl-loops of different TIM-barrel proteins can be classified as type a/~l or a~3 (Edwards, Sternberg & Thornton, 1987; Scheerlinck, Lasters, Claessens, Maeyer, Pio, Delhaise & Wodak, 1992). The loops can be identified by a positive ~o angle at position L1. The energetically unfavourable positive qo angle is frequently formed by a glycine residue. In narbonin there is one loop with a glycine residue (Gly 121). The loop connects

NARBONIN five intermolecular salt bridges are listed in Table 7. Many of the salt bridges are found in a-helices and loops between the secondary-structural elements. Most of the/3/a-loops and the additional secondary structures are stabilized by at least one salt bridge. Only Arg6 and Asp189 form a salt bridge between /~-strands and compensate the charges in the interior of the parallel fl-barrel (Fig. 12).

with B higher than 80,&2 were rejected from the model. 360 solvent molecules have at least one hydrogen bond to the protein molecule and another 112 have hydrogen bonds to other water molecules. Only 41 molecules lie outside the distance cut-off 3.5 A used for hydrogen bonds. The temperature factors vary between 8.0 A 2 for the internal water molecule Wat8, situated in the /3-barrel, and 77.1 ,&2 for Wat470. The average B factor of all waters is 47,~2 compared with 15 .~2 for all protein atoms and 21 &2 for the complete structure. The number of solvent molecules in the B-factor ranges is shown in Table 8. No features were observed in the electron-density maps which could be interpreted as buffer, metal or phosphate ions. In many ~3/a-barrel structures, a phosphate-binding site is formed by residues close to the N-terminus of the additional a-helix in the f18a8 loop (Wilmanns, Hyde, Davies, Kirschner & Jansonius, 1991). In narbonin there are two additional helices, the a'-helix with six residues and a", a 310-helix, which are situated between loops /37a7 and /38a8, respectively. The N-termini of both helices are close together. In contrast to /~4/a-barrel proteins having a

NARBONIN eye lenses, independent from their enzymatic activity (Wistow & Piatigorsky, 1987). Narbonin has been structurally classified into family C in the Farber and Petsko nomenclature (Farber & Petsko, 1990; Farber, 1993). Other members of this family with known threedimensional structure are TIM, IGPS, PRAI and TS. All these enzymes and narbonin consist of a single domain, have the major axis of the barrel ellipse close to strand /33 and have a small helix between /38 and c~8. In all four enzymes, the small helix is responsible for the phosphate binding (Wilmanns, Hyde, Davies, Kirschner & Jansonius, 1991), but in narbonin there is no evidence for such a binding site. There is an additional a-helix between /37 and a7, which has not yet been observed for other/3/c~-barrel proteins. The lack of the first helix and the additional antiparallel /3-strand are deviations from other /3/c~barrel proteins. In mandelate racemase (Neidhart, Howell, Petsko, Powers, Li, Kenyon & Gerlt, 1991) and muconate cycloisomerase (Goldman, Ollis & Steitz, 1987) the c~8-helix is missing. A further deviation from all other a//3-barrel proteins is the extended antiparallel /3-sheet which follows /32 almost without interruption and is situated parallel to c~3 and o~4. The/3-turn which connects the antiparallel strands points into the solution and is stabilized by crystal contacts. Phe39 and Ile41 of /3' contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic pocket on the C-terminus of the barrel and, therefore, may contribute to the formation of the prospective active site of narbonin. The most striking question is whether narbonin has an enzymatic function and what it could be. All attempts to identify an activity have failed to date. From the structural point of view, the salt bridge formed by the three residues Arg87, Asp231 and Glu132 may protect the prospective active site from being active, but salt bridges are also found in structurally and functionally interesting regions in other c~//3-barrel proteins. For instance, in TIM (Lolis, Alber, Davenport, Rose, Hartmann & Petsko, 1990; Noble, Zeelen, Mainfroid, Goraj, Gohimont, Martial & Wierenga, 1993) residues Lysl2 (in TIM from yeast, Lysl3 in TIM from E. coli) and Glu97 (Glu99 in TIM from E. coh) form a salt bridge in a similar way to that observed in narbonin by the residues Lysl2 and Asp265 directly, and Asp228 via a water molecule. In both structures, the negatively charged residue is provided from an additional c~-helix. In narbonin Asp265 is from a " between /38 and c~8, Asp228 from a ' between /37 and c~7. In TIM the Glu is from the helix between c~4 and /34. However, despite the fact that the negatively charged residues are from different loops, both salt bridges connect loops on the top of the barrel in a very similar way. The alignment of the sequences in this region at least does not show further identities. In summary, no structural features can be described which prevent narbonin from exercising a binding or catalytic function, but we cannot

phosphate-binding site, there are significant differences. In narbonin there are several negatively charged residues in this region and there are no glycines comparable to those found in several other /3/c~-barrel proteins after the /3-strands. Asp228 of o/ via a water molecule and Asp265 of ~" directly form salt bridges with Lysl2 of the first/3/a-loop (note that the first helix is missing in the/3/o~-barrel topology of narbonin, Fig. 13). 4.8. Crystal packing Narbonin has an accessible surface area of 13 200/~2 (DSSP; Kabsch & Sander, 1983). Most of the surface is covered by hydrophilic residues and many hydrogen bonds are formed by these residues with the surrounding solvent. The packing in the crystal is very compact and there are many interactions between neighbouring molecules. The packing involves layers of molecules with very close contacts and fewer contacts between the layers. The interaction of the molecules is mainly formed by loop regions. Subsequently, the loops /3'/3"(/32o~2), /34o~4, /36c~6, /37o~7 and ot'c~8 of one molecule are in contact with the loops before /32, c~2/33, c~3/34, c~4/35 and c~7/37 of the adjacent molecule. Therefore, the Cterminus of the/3-barrel lies on a solvent channel and is accessible to solvent. At least 17 intermolecular hydrogen bonds can be observed, including five salt bridges (Table 7). They stabilize extended loop regions of the molecule. The loop containing Arg271 and Lys275 fixes c~-helix 3 of the neighbouring molecule at two positions like a claw. In addition to the hydrophilic residues, there are several hydrophobic residues accessible to the solvent. Some of these are involved in intermolecular interactions. Phe253 forms a hydrophobic cluster with I1e268 and Va1267 of another molecule. I1e243 is in contact with the main chain of the residues Asn99 and Vall00, and Pro76 is close to the 'back' of Ser47 of the next molecule. Nevertheless, there are several positions in which hydrophobic side chains are exposed to the solvent.

5. Discussion

The refined structure of narbonin from Vicia narbonensis L represents the first /3/a-barrel structure for which there is no known enzymatic function. Only some eye lens proteins, crystallins, have additional functions in

identify striking structural similarities with other TIMlike structures in their active site. A comparison of narbonin with closely related proteins is impossible because narbonin is the first representative of the 2S globulins for which a crystal structure and amino-acid sequence is known. Biochemical characterization, sequencing and crystal structural analysis based on X-ray data to 1.9/~ resolution of a narbonin-like protein from Vicia pannonica is in progress (Schlesier, Hennig, Kraft & Horstmann, 1993). The narbonin from Vicia pannonica has a similar molecular weight, N-terminal sequence and crystallizes in the same space group, but deviations in peptide mapping suggest differences in the amino-acid sequence. Concanavalin B from Canavalia ensiformis is classified as a 2S globulin like narbonin (Ko, Ng & McPherson, 1993). Preliminary structural results suggest concanavalin B has an o~/~-barrel topology similar to narbonin, despite which there is no significant sequence similarity in the known parts of the sequence (concanavalin B has not been fully sequenced; Ko, Ng & McPherson, personal communication). Concanavalin B is expected to bind NADPH (Morrison, DeLozier, Robinson & McPherson, 1984). Concanavalin B (Hennig & Schlesier, unpublished results), narbonin from Vicia pannonica and Vicia narbonensis can be purified in a similar way and crystallized by pH shift at low ionic strength, giving crystals suitable for structural analysis at atomic resolution (Hennig & Schlesier, 1994). Detailed comparison of the three structures may help in the elucidation of the functional properties of these seed proteins.* The high-resolution X-ray structure of narbonin may serve for a better understanding of molecular processes. Subsequently, it can be used as a model for the investigation of biosynthesis, intercellular transport, processing, deposition and degradation of seed proteins. The use of narbonin for improvement of nutritional and technological quality of seeds by genetic engeneering (Lumen, 1990; Sun & Larkins, 1993) is limited, because it is accumulated in smaller amounts compared with vicilin and legumin. The amino-acid composition and the time of its biosynthesis and degradation support the classification as a storage protein, but its three-dimensional molecular structure arose suspicion to it having biological activity.
