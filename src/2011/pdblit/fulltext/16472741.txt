Abstract The transketolase gene (cbbT) that encodes the Calvin­Benson­Bassham pathway transketolase (CbbT) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein purified to homogeneity. Like other transketolases, R. sphaeroides CbbT was found to be inactivated in the presence of oxygen. At its optimal pH of 7.8, CbbT displays a specific activity of 37 U/mg, a KR5P of 949 lM, a KXu5P of 11 lM, and a KThDP of 1.8 lM. Cysteine 160, equivalent to Cys159 of the yeast enzyme, is found within the active site and is loosely conserved amongst several sources of transketolase. To investigate the role of cysteine 160 found in the active site of R. sphaeroides CbbT, this residue was targeted for mutagenesis. Cys160 was changed to alanine, serine, aspartate, and glutamate. To compare the effect of these mutations on ThDP binding, spectral techniques were employed in addition to analysis by enzymatic activity. Fluorescence quenching was used to measure both equilibrium binding constants as well as first order rates of binding. The results of these studies indicated that Cys160 played an important and substantial role in cofactor binding, revealing the importance of this loosely conserved residue. In addition, the Cys160 mutants did not appear to alter oxygenmediated inactivation. Ó 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Transketolase transfers a two carbon hydroxyethyl group from ketose donor substrates to a variety of aldose acceptor substrates in a stereospecific manner via the cofactor thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)1 [1,2]. This enzyme has been utilized in various asymmetric carbon­ carbon bond synthesis reactions in vitro, displaying an important role in industrial applications [3­5]. Essential

to its function is the binding and orientation of the ThDP cofactor, which has been shown to adopt a strained v-shaped structure in the active site of all known ThDP-dependent enzymes. Many important cofactor­protein interactions that have been established were initially inferred from crystal structure analysis of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) transketolase with a focus on strictly conserved residues [2]. Transketolase is apparently found in all organisms, playing an essential role of metabolite shuffling in both the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway and the Calvin­Benson­Bassham (CBB) reductive pentose phosphate cycle. In plants, transketolase was shown to play an important role in photosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism [6]. In humans, it is believed that a defect in transketolase is responsible for Wernicke­Korsakoff syndrome [7], a disorder characterized by acute

encephalopathy accompanied by chronic impairment of short-term memory. In addition, transketolase was recently recognized as a target for Avemar, the fermented wheat germ extract that exhibits anti-tumor properties [8]. In Escherichia coli, it was found that transketolase is susceptible to superoxide damage in a superoxide dismutase (SOD) deficient strain [9]. The inactivation of transketolase by superoxide is believed to occur through oxidation of the intermediate, 1,2-dihydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate [10,11]; this occurs in the presence of both OÀ and a donor substrate. By some unknown 2 mechanism, it was reported that TK from E. coli, covalently linked to a support matrix, undergoes inactivation when stored in the presence of air as opposed to storage under nitrogen [12]. Thus far, the catalytic properties of homogeneous transketolase used exclusively in the CBB reductive pentose phosphate pathway have not been reported from any source. In this study, the CBB-specific recombinant enzyme from the photosynthetic nonsulfur purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, CbbT, was purified to homogeneity after its gene was expressed in E. coli. CbbT exhibited oxygen sensitivity, similar to the E. coli enzyme. Residue C160 of CbbT corresponds to residue C159 of the yeast enzyme, which is known to be within the active site as determined by X-ray crystallography [2]. Sequence analysis has shown this residue to be loosely conserved across all branches of life; further it has been suggested that this reactive side chain may be responsible for the observed oxygen inactivation [13]. To investigate the role this active site residue plays in both catalysis and cofactor binding, C160 of CbbT was mutagenized to alanine, serine, aspartate, or glutamate. The results of both catalytic and fluorescence-binding studies with wild-type and mutant proteins clearly establish that Cys160 plays an important role in correctly positioning ThDP at the active site. No apparent role of this residue in solely influencing oxygen inactivation was noted.

Materials and methods Materials Ribose 5-P, xylulose 5-P, MgSO4 , ThDP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and NADþ were obtained from Sigma. Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were purchased from MWG Biotech. Sequencing was performed by the Plant-Microbe Genomics Facility at The Ohio State University. cbbT overexpression and purification of recombinant enzyme The cbbT gene was PCR-amplified from plasmid pJG5, a vector containing a 4 kb segment of the cbbII

operon from R. sphaeroides. This plasmid contains the complete cbbT gene [14]. The primers designed for amplification allowed for the introduction of a 30 NdeI and a 50 BglII restriction site. The PCR product was cloned into pCRscript and then into pET11a to create the expression vector pET11CbbT. While in pET11a, cbbT was sequenced in both directions to confirm the wildtype sequence. The vector pET11CbbT was used to overexpress the cbbT gene in the salt-inducible E. coli strain GJ1158 [15]. A 3.6 liter culture of LB­NaCl medium (in a 4 liter Erlenmeyer flask) was inoculated with 3 ml of an overnight culture, 5 M NaCl was added at an OD600 of 0.8 to bring the final NaCl concentration to 0.4 M. Induction was allowed to proceed overnight at 25 °C. The cells were harvested and washed two times with TEM (20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol (BME), and 1 mM EDTA) buffer; the pellet was stored at )80 °C until further use. All of the purification steps were conducted either at 4 °C or on ice. Cells were resuspended in 20 ml buffer A (20 mM Mops­NaOH, pH 6.9, 0.1 mM ThDP, 2 mM MgSO4 , and 10 mM BME) and lysed using a French press. This was followed by a low speed centrifugation (10,000g, 20 min). Nucleic acids were precipitated from the supernatant of the previous centrifugation by incubating extracts with 0.1% streptomycin sulfate on ice; after ultracentrifugation (100,000g, 1 h), followed by filtration through a 0.45 lm filter, the extract was loaded onto a 2.6 Â 14 cm DEAE FF­Sepharose column and eluted using a linear gradient of 2­15% buffer B (buffer A with 1 M ammonium sulfate). Active fractions were eluted between 85 and 130 mM ammonium sulfate, pooled, and then treated with solid ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 1 M. Following a 1 h equilibration time on ice, the solution was filtered and then loaded onto a 1.6 Â 90 cm phenyl­Sepharose HP column; elution was achieved using a linear gradient from 100 to 30% of buffer B. Active fractions eluting between 890 and 600 mM ammonium sulfate were pooled and diluted with buffer A to bring the final salt concentration to 50 mM. This material was loaded onto a 1.6 Â 11 cm Q-Sepharose HP column and active enzyme eluted using a linear gradient ranging from 0 to 20% buffer B. Active fractions, eluting between 115 and 210 mM ammonium sulfate, were concentrated (using Millipore spin concentrators, NMW 30 kDa), loaded onto a 1.6 Â 50 cm Superdex 200 gel filtration column, and eluted with 5% buffer B; CbbT peak elution was at 61.8 ml. For analytical gel filtration analysis, a 1.0 Â 30 cm Superose-12 column calibrated with 5% buffer B was used. Under these conditions CbbT eluted at 12.2 ml corresponding to a molecular weight of 90,000; this value is not close to the theoretically predicted homodimer molecular weight of 138,000. However, when CbbT was eluted in buffer A containing 500 mM NaCl, CbbT eluted at 11.8 ml, corresponding to

a molecular weight of 122,000. Following preparative gel filtration, glycerol was added to 20% and aliquots were stored at )80 °C until needed; no noticeable loss in activity was observed after storage. Site-directed mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved using the Quikchange kit from Stratagene. Mutagenesis was performed on the pUC19 vector containing the cbbT gene. The desired mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Following mutagenesis, a BamHI­NcoI fragment of 840 bp that contained the mutated sequence was transferred from the pUC19-based cbbT vector to the pET11a-based cbbT vector. The region of the mutation was sequenced in both directions to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. Activity measurements and determination of kinetic constants The enzymatic assay was based on the NADþ dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled system developed by Kochetov [16]. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein microassay procedure. All kinetic data were collected at 25 °C using a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer with temperature controller. Dependence of pH on activity was measured using three different buffers at approximate 0.2 pH unit intervals; the buffers used were Mops­NaOH, Hepes­NaOH, and glycylglycine. The exact pH of the reaction was measured immediately following the assay; all buffers were used at a final concentration of 200 mM. Substrate kinetics were determined in the presence of 0.1 mM ThDP and 5 mM MgSO4 . Xylulose 5-P was used as the donor substrate and ribose 5-P as the acceptor. SigmaPlot v8.0 was used for data analysis. Time course measurements The effect of oxygen inactivation was determined using septa-sealed serum vials which could be made gastight; these were sparged under a flow of either air or argon while on ice for at least 20 min. Vials containing the enzyme were then transferred to a 25 °C water bath and small aliquots were removed periodically for activity assays. Care was taken to minimize the introduction of oxygen into argon-sparged vials using a gastight Hamilton syringe that had been sparged with argon. Sequence alignment A total of 85 complete protein sequences obtained from the NCBI database were selected from a blastp search using the R. sphaeroides CbbT protein sequence.

A multiple alignment of the different sequences was achieved with Clustalx v.1.8 [17] using the Gonnet series weight matrix. Alignments were viewed and edited using Bioedit v5.0.9 [18]. Apoenzyme formation Apoenzymes were prepared by two methods. The first method involved dialysis of the holoenzyme against 20 mM glyclyglycine, pH 9.0, in the presence of 1 M ammonium sulfate and 10 mM BME at 4 °C. The first of four buffer exchanges also contained 1 mM EDTA. A second method was employed to save time; this consisted of apoenzyme formation while the protein was bound to a small 1 ml QSHP anion exchange column. The protein was bound to the column using pH 9.0 glyclglycine buffer containing 10 mM BME; this was then washed with 30 ml of the same buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, followed by 30 ml buffer without EDTA. The apoenzyme eluted after the application of a sharp gradient from 0 to 1 M ammonium sulfate. The resulting concentrated apoenzyme was then desalted using a 5 ml Hi-trap G-25 desalting column (Sigma) into a buffer of 20 mM Hepes­NaOH, pH 7.8, containing 0.1% BME. If the sample was not used immediately, glycerol was added to 20% and the protein was stored at )80 °C. Fluorescence measurements A Jobin Yvon-Spex model Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer was used for fluorometric data collection. The automated sample changer and Neslab RTE-111 temperature controller accessories were used with Starna 10 mm quartz fluorometry cuvettes with airtight septa screw caps. The inner filter effect was minimized by using a higher wavelength for excitation, where ThDP absorbs less (295 nm as opposed to 280 nm). The wavelength chosen for emission was 329 nm. In addition, the following correction factor was applied to the fluorescence values [19]: Fc;i ¼ Fo;i Â 10:5ðAx þAm;i Þ ; where Fc;i is the corrected fluorescence intensity at a particular wavelength i, Fo;i is the observed fluorescence, Ax is the absorbance of ThDP at the excitation wavelength, and Am;i is the absorbance of ThDP at the emission wavelength. This correction factor reportedly works well for small inner filter absorbances less than 2 OD [20]. In addition to the inner filter effect, it was noted that data followed the quadratic-binding equation much closer if the sample was allowed to equilibrate in the cuvette. For this reason, sequential additions of ThDP were made to the cuvette, allowing for equilibration to occur after each addition. The amount of time required to reach equilibrium varied based on the amount of ThDP added, taking up to $3 h for lower

concentrations of ThDP and <1 h for higher concentrations. The standard assay contained 2 mM MgSO4 , 0.1% BME, 100 mM buffer, and 800 nM enzyme (calculated by monomeric molecular weight). The equilibrium observed fluorometrically was confirmed enzymatically by removing small aliquots at each ThDP concentration for activity assays. For all binding studies, ThDP concentrations were determined using a e267 of 8520 MÀ1 cmÀ1 [21]. SigmaPlot v8.0 was used for data analysis. Kinetic ThDP-binding measurements Fluorescence detection of holoenzyme formation was utilized to obtain a first order rate constant of ThDP binding to apo C160D and apo CbbT enzymes. Fluorescence instrument settings were identical to those for the equilibrium binding with the exception that excitation was at 280 nm; all measurements were obtained at 25 °C. Each sample contained 100 mM buffer, 0.1% BME, 2 mM MgSO4 , and 800 nM apoenzyme. Reconstitution was initiated by the addition of 5 ll of a 10 mM ThDP solution for a final concentration of 50 lM ThDP. The cuvette was quickly mixed by inversion three times and data collection begun immediately; the estimated dead time for this experiment was 8 s. Data collection continued until a leveling off of fluorescence was achieved, ranging from 6 to 45 min depending on the pH. Data were exported into SigmaPlot v8.0 for data analysis. Fluorescence quenching data were fit to the single-exponential equation: Y ¼ a1 þ a2 Â expða3 Â X Þ þ a4 Â X ; with an representing fit parameters. For comparison, data were also fit to the double-exponential equation: Y ¼ a1 þ a2 Â expða3 Â X Þ þ a4 Â expða5 Â X Þ. Circular dichroism (CD) Near-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements were taken using an Aviv model 62A DS spectrometer, scanning from 260 to 360 nm at 1 nm intervals with a bandwidth of 1 nm and a 2 s signaling average; five scans were averaged for each sample. Data were collected using 1 cm quartz cuvettes with temperature controller set to 25 °C. All protein concentrations were in the range of 0.50­0.80 mg/ml in 20 mM Hepes­NaOH buffer, pH 7.8, containing 2 mM MgSO4 , and 0.1% BME. ThDP was added to 25 lM final concentration and samples were allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C for 1­3 h. Data was smoothed by applying a negative exponential 10 degree polynomial regression with SigmaPlot v8.0. Molecular modeling For visualization of the ThDP-binding pocket, a theoretical model of CbbT based on the crystal structures of yeast transketolase (pdb IDs: 1AYO, 1GPU,

1ITZ, 1NGS, 1TKA, 1TKB, 1TKC, and 1TRK) [22­28] was constructed, using the program Swiss-Model. Alignments and mutations were analyzed using the programs SPDBV and O [29­31].

Results Purification and biochemical properties of CbbT A high level of cbbT overexpression was achieved using the system described in the Materials and methods. With microaerobic growth conditions, two combined 3.6 liter cultures typically produced a total of about 9 g of wet cell mass. A standard yield of 125 mg of homogeneous CbbT was readily purified from this amount of cell material (Fig. 1), corresponding to an overall yield of 40%. Similar to E. coli transketolase A, CbbT displayed thermal degradation in the presence of SDS [32]; for this reason, samples were not heated prior to loading onto SDS­PAGE gels. This degradation occurred even in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma); interestingly, it could be prevented by the presence of high concentrations of acceptor substrate (100 mM R5P or F6P). CbbT migration on SDS­ PAGE gels (MW ¼ 69 kDa) and native gel filtration chromatography (MW ¼ 122 kDa) indicated that the CbbT protein was most likely a homodimer under nondenaturing conditions. The optimal pH for CbbT activity was determined to be 7.8, similar to that reported for the yeast enzyme. Three different buffers were used to examine an overlapping range of pH values from pH 6 to 9; Mops­NaOH

buffer was used from pH 6.0 to 7.2, Hepes­NaOH buffer from pH 6.8 to 8.2, and glycylglycine buffer from pH 7.8 to 9.0. Using buffers with overlapping pH ranges allowed us to rule out any buffer specific effects on activity. In all cases, the activity of the excess coupling enzymes employed in the reaction mixture was also monitored, to insure that any change in measured activity was caused only by effects on CbbT. Interestingly, for R. sphaeroides CbbT, Tris buffers invoked strong inhibition on enzyme activity. The Km for the common substrates R5P and Xu5P were determined at the optimal pH; CbbT displayed an extremely low KXu5P (11.4 lM) compared to other transketolases and a KR5P of 949 lM, which approximated that determined for other sources of this enzyme. Both substrate Km values were directly affected by pH, displaying an increased Km with increasing pH (Table 1). Also similar to other transketolases, CbbT displayed inhibition by inorganic phosphate. Sulfate anions, however, did not inhibit

The assays contained 2 mM MgSO4 , 0.1% BME, 100 lM ThDP, and 200 mM of either Mops­NaOH (pH 6.7), Hepes­NaOH (pH 7.8), or glycylglycine (pH 8.5). One substrate concentration was varied (0.03­20 mM R5P or 1.7­440 lM Xu5P) while the other substrate was held constant at a saturating concentration (8 mM R5P or 220 lM Xu5P).

CbbT activity as reported for the yeast enzyme [33]; in fact, sulfate appeared to significantly aid enzyme stability, even at concentrations as low as 5 mM (Fig. 2A). This was demonstrated by incubating a sample of CbbT that had been purified largely in the absence of ammonium sulfate (using NaCl with the exception of the PSHP column) in various concentrations of this salt

(Fig. 2A). It was noted that at higher concentrations there was even an increase in activity, suggesting that the purified enzyme was not fully reconstituted. This increase in activity was proportional to the amount of ammonium sulfate present and was not observed for samples that had been purified in the presence of ammonium sulfate. For this reason, ammonium sulfate was included in all buffers employed for purification and storage of the enzyme. Oxygen sensitivity of CbbT The oxygen sensitivity of CbbT was demonstrated by time course experiments in which the activity was monitored congruent with a control sample containing either argon or nitrogen in the gas phase. Oxygenmediated inactivation occurred rather slowly in the presence of buffers that contained 0.1% BME, with a half-time inactivation of approximately 10 h (Fig. 2B). It was further shown that the rate of inactivation could be markedly slowed by the addition of higher concentrations of BME or DTT. After oxygen-mediated inactivation, however, all attempts to recover activity failed, suggesting that this process was irreversible. Bioinformatics analysis of transketolase sequences A comparison of 85 different complete transketolase and transketolase-related sequences homologous to CbbT indicated that 48 sequences (or 56%) had a preference for Cys at the position equivalent to residue 159 of the Saccharomyces enzyme; Asp was found in 22 different sequences (or 26%), Glu in 12 different sequences (or 14%), and finally Ala was shown to be present in only 3 of the 85 enzymes compared (or 4%). All three sequences containing Ala at this position were actually putative 1-deoxy-D -xylulose 5-phosphate synthases (DXPS), proteins that are not classically transketolase enzymes but catalyze a transketolase-type reaction. Not all DXPS sequences have Ala at this position, though it appears to be preferred for that enzyme. Mammalian transketolase sequences thus far all appear to contain Glu at this position, and this is also true for the two archaeal transketolases considered in this

alignment. Thus far only the E. coli transketolase, and now R. sphaeroides CbbT, have been shown to be subjected to oxygen-mediated inactivation; there is no indication that enzymes from sources that contain an alternate residue at position 159 (or the equivalent residue) are less sensitive to oxygen. In addition, the function of this residue has yet to be explored by sitedirected mutagenesis. Kinetic properties of wild-type and mutant CbbT proteins Based on its location in the active site, Cys160 was positioned to influence important catalytic functions as well as the efficiency of the enzyme to bind its cofactor. In addition, cysteine's propensity for modification suggested that this residue might somehow be related to the enzyme's sensitivity to oxygen. To test the role of Cys160 in all these potential functions, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to alter this residue to alanine, serine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid. Alanine and serine represent nonconservative and conservative substitutions, respectively; aspartate and glutamate were chosen based on their natural occurrence in the position occupied by cysteine in many other sources of transketolase. In general, mutant CbbT proteins behaved similar to wild-type CbbT throughout purification, with the exception of the PSHP column, in which mutant proteins C160A, C160S, and C160E all displayed a much higher affinity for this matrix. For these mutant proteins, it was necessary to elute the enzyme from the column with pH 9.0 buffer solutions. With the exception of the C160A enzyme, which retained only 7% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, all mutant CbbT proteins possessed reasonable levels of enzymatic activity (from 26 to 81% of the wild-type activity). All active mutant proteins maintained Km values for the substrates R5P and Xu5P similar to that seen for the wild-type enzyme, with the exception of C160E, which displayed KXu5P values approximately 6fold higher than wild-type CbbT (Table 2). With the surprising exception of C160D, all active mutants displayed maximal enzymatic activity around pH 7.8; whereas C160D preferred a more basic pH value of 8.5 (results not shown).

Oxygen sensitivity of C160 mutants The C160D enzyme behaved similarly to wild-type CbbT in the presence of oxygen, displaying a similar rate of inhibition (Fig. 2C). One notable difference was the observed increase in activity of the C160D mutant in both the N2 -sparged sample as well as the O2 -sparged sample prior to inactivation. This would suggest that the purified mutant was not fully reconstituted upon purification. Similar studies with the C160S mutant enzyme were attempted; however, this mutant protein proved to be too unstable for incubation at 25 °C under these conditions and both aerobic and anaerobic samples quickly lost activity. As for the C160A and C160E mutant proteins, oxygen sensitivity, as measured by enzyme activity, was determined during data collection for the ThDP affinity studies. Apoenzyme, incubated with variable concentrations of ThDP, was assayed over time to determine the reaction velocity at equilibrium for each ThDP concentration. Each of these two mutant enzymes displayed a short-lived plateau of maximal activity ($1 h) after which activity began to decrease. This decrease was believed to be related to oxygen sensitivity and/or the general instability of these two mutant enzymes. Affinity for ThDP While it was clear that the C160A enzyme had drastically reduced enzymatic activity, the potential importance of Cys160 in binding ThDP was assessed after determining the amount of ThDP that remained bound after passing the wild-type and mutant proteins through a G-25 desalting column. ThDP concentrations were quantitated by the fluorometric detection of ThDP oxidized to thiochrome in an alkaline medium with ferricyanide [34]. Initial estimates were that the C160A and C160S enzymes retained 2 and 40%, respectively, of the amount of ThDP associated with the wild-type protein. To accurately quantify differences in ThDP affinity (KD and Km ), both fluorescent and enzymatic methods were employed. The potential use of fluorometric methods to measure cofactor binding to transketolase was previously considered [35], however no other KD values were found in the literature. Fluorometry, however, has been employed to measure ThDP binding in pyruvate decarboxylase [36] and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [37]. Adapting these methods for CbbT was found to be convenient and data sets for determining KD values for CbbT and the C160D mutant at their respective optimal pH were obtained (Fig. 3A). The three other mutant proteins, C160S, C160A, and C160E, all required too much ThDP, and technical considerations precluded the ability to make an accurate inner filter correction (described in Materials and methods). Thus, data were collected for CbbT and the

Data were expressed as the difference in fluorescence observed divided by the initial fluorescence (DF =Fi ) vs. the concentration of ThDP. (B) Km ThDP for CbbT (dÞ and the C160D (sÞ enzymes at their respective optimal pH values. Data were expressed as U/mg vs. the concentration (lM) ThDP.

C160D mutant enzymes only. Initially, C160D protein data were collected at pH 7.8 (yielding a KD value of 2.50 Æ 0.42 lM), however it was later realized that the optimal pH of this protein was quite different from the wild-type enzyme (pH 8.5 and 7.8, respectively). For this reason, KD values for CbbT and the C160D mutant enzymes were determined at three different pHs (Table 3), above and below the optimum of the wild-type protein. Clearly, both proteins exhibited similar KD 's at their respective optimum pH (KD of 3.4 lM for CbbT and 3.6 lM for C160D). To reinforce the KD results, as well as to consider how the other C160 mutants interacted with cofactor, relative affinities for ThDP were also determined enzymatically. Substrate concentration vs. activity plots for CbbT and C160D were generated (Fig. 3B). Plots were

Numbers are expressed in lM ThDP. Fluorescence was excited at 295 nm while the disappearance of fluorescence emission was monitored at 329 nm under variable ThDP concentrations (0­16 mM at pH 6.7, 0­50 mM at pH 7.8, and 0­117 mM at pH 8.5).

also generated for the other mutant proteins and Km values determined at pH 6.7, 7.8, and 8.5 (Table 4). For the C160E enzyme, the Km could not be determined at pH 8.5 because this protein showed no activity at this pH. However, the C160S enzyme had an approximate 700-fold increase in Km compared to both C160D and CbbT at pH 7.8. In agreement with the dissociation data, C160D displayed a higher apparent affinity for ThDP than CbbT at all pH values examined. The C160E enzyme possessed an affinity for ThDP even weaker than the C160S mutant with a value approximately 1400­1700 times higher than CbbT and C160D, respectively. This Km value did decrease slightly when the pH was changed from 7.8 to 6.7, as did the value for the wild-type and C160D enzymes. Using a large amount of C160A enzyme allowed KThDP data collection. Interestingly, this mutant enzyme displayed positive cooperativity upon binding ThDP with a Hill constant of 1.9 in the range from 10 to 85% saturation (Fig. 4). This was unlike all other mutant and wild-type proteins, which showed no cooperativity upon ThDP binding. The KThDP value for C160A obtained from the Hill plot showed a tremendous decrease in affinity with a Km value nearly 8000 fold higher than the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.8 (Table 4). To determine whether the increased ThDP affinity for the C160D mutation was due to an alteration in

binding mechanism, kinetic-binding studies were performed at the same pH values as for the affinity measurements. Since the reaction time of ThDP binding to form active enzyme appeared to be of the order of minutes, an accurate kinetic rate of formation could be calculated by monitoring the quenching of intrinsic fluorescence upon addition of a saturating amount of ThDP to the apo enzyme. All data could be reasonably fit to a first order exponential equation (Figs. 5A and B). However, the data collected at pH 6.8 better fit a double-exponential function for both CbbT (Figs. 5C and D) and C160D, suggesting a pHinduced change in the binding mechanism. This change could be the result of either a newly introduced step in binding or a change in the reaction rate of a preexisting binding step. The latter would suggest that ThDP binding to the apoenzyme is a multi-step process and perhaps the result of one active site binding before the other to form the active dimer. A comparison of these first order rate constants showed that there was no significant difference between the C160D mutant and wild-type (Table 5), suggesting that the mechanism of ThDP has not been altered in this mutant. Finally, CD measurements, through the appearance of a new band (range 300­380 nm), may also be used to assess the ability of ThDP to bind to transketolase [38]. Although the assignment of this band remains unclear, it was most recently proposed that the band results from the conversion of a 40 -amino to a 10 ,40 -imino tautomer of the ThDP pyrimidine [39]. This would suggest that 10 ,40 -iminopyrimidine is the preferred tautomer in the hydrophobic pocket of the active site in transketolase. However, the E1 subunit of E. coli pyruvate dehydrogenase does not display a new CD band in this region upon ThDP addition [40]. In this subunit the imino tautomer, formed by the addition of the stable reaction

Reconstitution was initiated by the addition of 5 ll of a 10 mM ThDP solution for a final concentration of 50 lM ThDP. Fluorescence excitation was at 280 nm and emission was monitored at 329 nm; the estimated dead time for this experiment was 8 s.

In the CD spectra of CbbT, like in other transketolases, an inversion of ellipticity was observed around 330 nm upon ThDP binding. Qualitative examination of CbbT and the C160 mutant proteins indicated that inversion was observed only for CbbT and C160D in the presence of 25 lM

ThDP at pH 7.8, in agreement with the above kinetic data (Fig. 6).

other enzymes to facilitate the regeneration of the acceptor molecule for CO2 fixation by this pathway. Despite its function in catalyzing important interconversions of sugar molecules in organisms that reductively assimilate CO2 , there have not been detailed structure­function studies of transketolase proteins that participate in the CBB pathway. The R. sphaeroides cbbT gene provided the first available deduced sequence of any transketolase protein [14] and its organization with other structural genes of the CBB pathway allows for convenient and efficient regulation of gene expression [42]. The close homology of all transketolases allows the available yeast structural models [22­28] to be used to understand aspects of the structure and function of this enzyme from different sources. From these X-ray crystallography models, Cys160 presumably interacts with cofactor ThDP to the first phosphate group via Hbonding through a water molecule. Indeed, this interaction can be visualized by looking at the electron density of the solved structure (Fig. 7). The b-factor of the H2 O molecule (HOH 405 in 1GPU, b ¼ 18:39) allows for its confident placement. Many known interactions determined from the crystal structure have been explored and tested by other methods, such as site-directed mutagenesis. Due to its location in the active site as well as the potential of cysteine to act as a reactive side chain, we have prepared four mutant proteins with alterations at position C160 in CbbT of R. sphaeroides. Each mutant protein was produced in large quantities in E. coli strain GJ1158, which provided a convenient host to obtain significant amounts of purified recombinant protein without having to resort to making tagged fusion proteins. The physicochemical properties of the mutant proteins clearly indicated that Cys160 plays a critical role in ThDP binding. The ability of serine to form a slightly stronger but shorter H-bond than cysteine typically makes this a conservative mutation. However, the drastic effect this substitution had on the ability of the protein to bind ThDP suggested that there is not much flexibility in shortening the hydrogendonating side chain. The C160A mutation further supported this, causing a severe decrease in ThDP affinity as well as an altered binding mechanism that displayed positive cooperativity. Aspartate proved to be a reasonably conservative substitution enzymatically, with the increased pH optimum of the C160D enzyme the most notable change. In addition to maintaining about 75% of the activity of wild-type CbbT, the C160D protein displayed an equal if not better affinity for ThDP at all pH values examined. Measuring both substrate Km values of the C160D mutant at its preferred pH of 8.5 resulted in a catalytic efficiency similar to that of the wild-type. With its low pKa , it may be assumed that aspartate acts as an H-bond acceptor rather than donor, still interacting through the water molecule to bind ThDP. Further, with kinetic binding rates similar

to wild-type, the changes observed in the aspartate mutant do not appear to be caused by an altered ThDPbinding mechanism. Interestingly, a deviation from first order binding was observed at reduced pH, possibly caused by a nonequivalence in cofactor binding of the two chemically equivalent active sites [43]. Nonequivalent active sites during catalysis are a feature believed to be common among all ThDP-dependent enzymes [44]. In contrast to aspartate, glutamate displayed a weak affinity for ThDP, as well as a substantial increase in substrate Km values. Since glutamate naturally occurs in this position in mammalian and archaeal transketolases, a different structure in this region of the ThDP-binding pocket may be suggested for these two groups of transketolase enzymes. Compared to aspartate, lengthening of the side chain by one C­C bond appeared to place the side chain out of range for any beneficial interaction with the water molecule, perhaps even sterically interfering with ThDP binding (Fig. 7). Although Cys160 did not appear to be solely involved with the interesting and perplexing propensity of CbbT to be inactivated in the presence of oxygen, perhaps this residue, in combination with others, might be important for this purpose. Certainly, the importance of Cys160 in cofactor binding has been demonstrated by these studies. Though not directly involved in catalysis, this loosely conserved residue plays a major role in the binding and proper positioning of the cofactor ThDP. To maintain the constrained v-shaped structure required for activity, ThDP must be securely bound within its pocket through many interactions between the protein and the pyrophosphate and the protein and the pyrimidine, including the interaction of the a-phosphate with C160 bridged through a solvent water molecule.
