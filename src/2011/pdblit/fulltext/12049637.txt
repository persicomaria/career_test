Human epidermal-type fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP) belongs to a family of intracellular 14­15 kDa lipid-binding proteins, whose functions have been associated with fatty acid signalling, cell growth, regulation and differentiation. As a contribution to understanding the structure­function relationship, we report in the present study features of its solution structure and backbone dynamics determined by NMR spectroscopy. Applying multi-dimensional high-resolution NMR techniques on unlabelled and "&N-enriched recombinant human E-FABP, the "H and "&N resonance assignments were completed. On the basis of 2008 distance restraints, the three-dimensional solution structure of human E-FABP was subsequently obtained H (backbone atom root-mean-square deviation of 0.92p0.11 A ; H where 1 A l 0.1 nm), consisting mainly of 10 anti-parallel strands that form a -barrel structure. "&N relaxation experiments (T , T and heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects) at 500, 600 " # and 800 MHz provided information on the internal dynamics of

the protein backbone. Nearly all non-terminal backbone amide groups showed order parameters S # 0.8, with an average value of 0.88p0.04, suggesting a uniformly low backbone mobility in the nanosecond-to-picosecond time range. Moreover, hydrogen\ deuterium exchange experiments indicated a direct correlation between the stability of the hydrogen-bonding network in the sheet structure and the conformational exchange in the millisecond-to-microsecond time range. The features of E-FABP backbone dynamics elaborated in the present study differ markedly from those of the phylogenetically closely related hearttype FABP and the more distantly related ileal lipid-binding protein, implying a strong interdependence with the overall protein stability and possibly also with the ligand-binding affinity for members of the lipid-binding protein family. Key words : fatty acid carrier, lipid-binding protein, NMR spectroscopy, "&N relaxation, psoriasis.

INTRODUCTION
The human epidermal-type fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP) was originally detected in patients suffering from psoriasis, a hyperproliferative skin disease characterized by abnormal differentiation and disordered lipid metabolism [1]. In this pathological situation, E-FABP was immunohistochemically localized in differentiated keratinocytes [2]. The protein is identical with a melanogenic inhibitor isolated from grafted human skin ; it inhibits tyrosinase activity in normal melanocytes as well as in a melanoma cell line and reduces cellular proliferation of these cells when added exogenously, whereas normal skin fibroblasts remain unaffected [3]. FABPs, in general, form a family of small (14­15 kDa) cytosolic non-enzymic proteins that display tissue-specific expression and may play a role in fatty acid signalling [4­6], cell growth and differentiation [7,8]. It has also been proposed that these proteins are involved in the cellular uptake of lipids, their transport to metabolic pathways [9] and in the regulation of

metabolizing proteins [10]. All of these proteins have 127­135 amino acids and are phylogenetically related. Sequence similarities among the various FABPs range between 38­70 % [11]. Generally, for sequences of orthologous types isolated from different host organisms, the degree of similarity is high, whereas, for paralogous types of the same host organism, the similarities are generally lower. Numerous members of this protein family have been isolated from a variety of mammalian, avian and fish tissues as well as from insects [12,13]. FABPs belong to a larger family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins (LBPs) that display amino acid motifs aimed at highaffinity binding of amphiphilic ligands, such as long-chain fatty acids, bile acids, retinoids and eicosanoids. Tertiary structures found in this protein family show a highly conserved folding motif, i.e. a -barrel consisting of two orthogonal -sheets with five anti-parallel -strands each and a helix-turn-helix domain partially covering the internal water-filled cavity [14]. The ligand is non-covalently bound inside the cavity, almost inaccessible to the external solvent. LBPs can be grouped according to sequence

by Glatz and Veerkamp [22], and subsequently re-lipidated using a 3-fold excess of stearic acid (C : ), for which E-FABP shows ") ! the highest binding affinity [2]. Recombinant bovine H-FABP was prepared and delipidated as reported previously [23]. The hydrogen\deuterium exchange of H-FABP in the apo-form (1.2 mM) was performed as described previously for holo H-FABP [24]. A series of homonuclear onedimensional and two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments were collected at a temperature of 310 K and a "H resonance frequency of 600.13 MHz to follow the amide­proton exchange over time.

homology, which is consistent with the ligand-binding characteristics [15] : (I ) the intracellular retinoid-binding proteins ; (II ) the ileal lipid-binding protein (ILBP), which binds bile acid, and the liver-type FABP (` L-FABP '), which binds two fatty acids ; (III ) intestinal-type FABP (I-FABP), which binds a single fatty acid in a linear conformation ; and (IV ) FABPs with the fatty acid bound in a highly bent or U-shaped conformation. The E-FABP examined in the present study belongs to the last group along with adipocyte-type FABP (A-FABP), brain-type FABP (` B-FABP '), heart-type FABP (H-FABP) and myelin-type FABP (M-FABP), where the carboxylate end of the fatty acid is buried within the binding cavity and forms hydrogen bonds with highly conserved tyrosine and arginine residues, either directly or through an ordered water molecule. The hydrocarbon tail of the fatty acid forms van der Waals interactions with hydrophobic residues in the binding cavity and with ordered water molecules that are in contact with polar residues inside the binding pocket [16]. Recombinant human E-FABP consists of 135 amino acids (15.2 kDa) and shows strong binding to stearic acid. The binding affinity decreases on reduction of the number of carbon atoms in the acyl chain or the introduction of double bonds [2]. Moreover, E-FABP displays a different electrophoretic mobility compared with FABPs from other human tissues or cellular retinoidbinding proteins. Another unique feature of orthologous EFABPs is the presence of 5­6 conserved cysteine residues, a number unusually high for members of this protein family. The crystallographic structure of human E-FABP, solved recently by Hohoff et al. [17], showed the existence of a single disulphide bridge between Cys"#! and Cys"#(, the only reported case in the entire LBP family. Moreover, it is known that E-FABP forms a complex with psoriasin (also known as S100A7) [18], a protein of the S100 gene family that has been associated with psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia and is secreted by neoplastic keratinocytes in bladder and breast carcinomas [19,20]. Thus an investigation of the E-FABP : psoriasin complex in solution may eventually be useful in understanding the co-ordinated up-regulation of EFABP and S100A7 in psoriasis. In addition to the solution structure of human E-FABP complexed with stearic acid, the present study describes the protein backbone dynamics determined by means of "&N relaxation (T and T ) and steady-state heteronuclear "&N-o"Hq nuclear " # Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements. Protein dynamics is an important aspect of the relationship between structure and function for most biochemical processes. Previously observed differences in the hydrogen-exchange behaviour of backbone amide protons have indicated that proton stability and dynamics are distinct for several LBPs [21]. Thus "&N backbone relaxation experiments may shed more light on the differences in the dynamics between the various members of this protein family. The backbone relaxation and hydrogen\deuterium exchange data obtained in the present study for human E-FABP in complex with stearic acid are compared with those of other LBPs in order to gain a better understanding of the relationships between their structure, dynamics and function.

NMR data collection and processing
The NMR data collection was performed at pH 5.6 and 298 K. The 3­4 mM E-FABP samples were prepared in 20 mM KH PO buffer containing 0.05 % NaN and 10 % (v\v) #H O. # % $ # Homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY as well as "&N-edited heteronuclear triple-quantum coherence (` HTQC '), heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC), TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC experiments were carried out on a Bruker DMX spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) operating at a "H resonance frequency of 600.13 MHz and using a 5 mm triple-resonance ("H\"$C\"&N) probe with XYZ-gradient capability. The TOCSY experiments were performed with spinlock times of either 80 or 4.8 ms (to obtain COSY-type information with less spectral overlap). For the NOESY experiments, mixing times between 150­200 ms were used. The homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY spectra were recorded in a phase-sensitive mode with timeproportional phase incrementation of the initial pulse. Quadrature detection was used in both dimensions with the carrier placed in the centre of the spectrum on the water resonance. The water signal was suppressed by selective presaturation during the relaxation delay. In the NOESY experiments water saturation was also applied during the mixing time. All three-dimensional (3D) experiments made use of pulsed-field gradients for coherence selection and artefact suppression, and utilized gradientsensitivity-enhancement schemes when appropriate [25,26]. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was achieved using either the States\TPPI (time-proportional phase incrementation) or the echo\anti-echo method. Baseline corrections were applied wherever necessary. All spectra were calibrated with respect to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulphonate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as an external reference [27]. The spectral data were processed on a Silicon Graphics workstation using the Bruker XWIN-NMR 1.3 software package. Peak-picking and data analysis of the transformed spectra were performed with the AURELIA 2.5.9 program (Bruker).

Constraint generation and structure calculation
The "H and "&N resonance assignments were obtained via the classical NOE-based assignment strategy of Wuthrich [28]. $ The NOE-derived distance constraints were determined from 2D homonuclear NOESY and 3D "&N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. Automated assignments of the NOEs, on the basis of chemical shifts only, were achieved using a MATLAB 5.0 routine. The upper distance limits were set by an internal calibration on the basis of the intensities of sequential and medium-range NOEs from residues located within well-defined secondary structure elements. The cross-peak intensities were grouped into four H H different distance categories : 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 6.0 A (1 A l 0.1 nm). Experimental evidence for hydrogen bonds was obtained from hydrogen\deuterium exchange in perdeuterated buffer (20 mM KH PO containing 0.05 % NaN , pH 7.6, uncorrected # % $ reading) after 80 min at 298 K. The structure calculations were

To obtain "&N-enriched E-FABP, the protein was expressed in M9 minimal medium with "&NH Cl (Cambridge Isotope Labor% atories, Andover, MA, U.S.A.) as the sole nitrogen source.

performed with the DYANA 1.5 program package [29], which uses simulated annealing in combination with molecular dynamics in torsion angle space. Assignments of ambiguous NOE cross-peaks were made by applying a structure-aided filtering strategy in repeated rounds of structure calculations. Starting ab initio, 300 conformers were calculated in 8000 annealing steps each. A total of 126 stereospecific assignments of prochiral methylene and isopropyl groups were obtained with the program GLOMSA [30]. Pseudo-atom correction for unassigned stereo partners and magnetically equivalent protons was applied as proposed by Wuthrich et al. [31]. Subsequent energy minimiza$ tion in the presence of the NMR restraints was performed on the 20 best DYANA conformers by using the DISCOVER module of the INSIGHT 97 software package (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). The consistent valence force field H [32] was used with a dielectric constant equal to r (distance in A). H A force constant of 20 kcal:mol-":A-# (1 cal  4.184 J) was used in the NOE restraint term. The resulting structures were analysed with PROCHECK-NMR [33].

calculated and fitted with the Modelfree4 program of Palmer and co-workers [40,41]. Three models for the spectral density function were applied to derive backbone dynamics information from the experimentally determined relaxation rates R , R and NOE. " # The first model was based on the single timescale model-free formalism proposed by Lipari and Szabo [42,43], with fitting of both S# and e. The second model added an Rex term to the model-free formalism, providing fits to S# and Rex. Finally, the extended form of the model-free formalism [44] was used as another model of the spectral density function, fitting the parameters S#, S# and e. S# represents the amplitude of s f the nanosecond-to-picosecond backbone mobility (S# l 1 corresponds to a completely restricted orientation of the N­H vector, whereas S# l 0 indicates unrestricted motion). Non-zero values of the transverse relaxation rate Rex are expected to appear when processes of conformational or chemical exchange occur within the millisecond-to-microsecond time range.

RESULTS Resonance assignments of human E-FABP
Using a series of homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR experiments, the "H and "&N resonance assignments were completed for recombinant human E-FABP complexed with stearic acid and are available at the BioMagResBank (http:\\www.bmrb.wisc. edu) under the accession number BMRB-5083. The proton resonance assignments were mainly derived from 2D homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY spectra. "H\"&N-correlated 3D TOCSY-HSQC and 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra were used to identify the "&N resonances of backbone amides and to verify the obtained proton resonance assignments. Side-chain NH reso# nances were identified using a 2D "H\"&N-heteronuclear triplequantum coherence spectrum. The sequential resonance assignments of the backbone amide groups are presented in a 2D "H\"&N-HSQC spectrum (Figure 1). Resonance assignments of FABPs are often hindered by the occurrence of multiple spin-systems. For bovine H-FABP, such spin-system heterogeneities within the so-called ` portal region ' indicated up to four separate conformational states due to a mixture of different fatty acid ligands [45]. The portal region is located between helix II (see Figure 3, right-hand panel for secondary structure denotation) and the turns connecting strands C and D as well as E and F, apparently representing the only opening in the protein surface through which the fatty acid ligand can enter and exit the internal binding cavity [46]. In the case of human E-FABP, however, just nine out of 22 residues that exhibit spin-system heterogeneities are part of this portal region, which encompasses residues 27­39, 57­62 and 76­82. Two separate proton spin-systems were observed for each of the following amino acid residues : Arg"# ( A), Val#) (I­II turn), Met$& and Ala$( (both II), Ala$* (II­B linker), Ile%% and Thr%' (both B), Lys&& ( C), Gln'% ( D), Gly(! and Glu(" (both D­E turn), Thr(' ( E), Ala() and Asp(* (both E­F turn), Phe)* ( F), Thr*! ( F­G turn), Val*& ( G), Lys""! ( H), Val"#" ( I) and Glu"$& (C-terminus). Three different proton spin-systems were observed for Gly$' (II) and Thr(( ( E­F turn). Remarkably, the OH resonance of Thr(( shows three distinct signals around 5.84 p.p.m., analogous to the corresponding residue Thr(% in bovine H-FABP [45]. Moreover, Gly$' in -helix II belongs to a number of sequentially neighbouring residues (Met$&, Gly$', Ala$( and Ala$*) that display multiple spin-systems also in bovine H-FABP (Val$#, Gly$$, Asn$% and Thr$'). The same applies to Ala() and Asp(* in the E­F turn, which correspond to Ala(& and Asp(' in H-FABP.

Relaxation measurements
T , T and steady-state heteronuclear "&N-o"Hq NOE measure" # ments were performed according to known pulse schemes with a gradient-selected echo\anti-echo sensitivity enhancement technique [34,35]. For the longitudinal (R ) and transverse (R ) " # relaxation rate constants, a series of 8­12 spectra with relaxation periods between 16­960 ms for T and 25­282 ms for T were " # collected on Bruker DMX spectrometers operating at "H resonance frequencies of 499.87, 600.13 and 800.13 MHz. The R " and R rates were determined by non-linear least squares # fitting of the peak intensities versus mixing time, using monoexponential functions provided in the RMX software package developed in our laboratory by Jurgen Schmidt (presently at the $ National Institute for Medical Research, London, U.K.). Steadystate heteronuclear "&N-o"Hq NOE values were obtained from the ratio of the peak intensities observed with and without "H saturation. In order to suppress time- or temperature-dependent effects, the spectra were acquired in an interleaved mode with incremented relaxation delays. All experiments were recorded with 256 t increments of 2048 data points in t . The spectral " # widths were set to 6010 Hz ("H)\1773 Hz ("&N) at 500 MHz, 7184 Hz ("H)\2131 Hz ("&N) at 600 MHz and 9766 Hz ("H)\ 2841 Hz ("&N) at 800 MHz. The overall molecular shape of the members of the FABP family is not exactly spherical, but rather resembles an oblate ellipsoid. The ratio of the principal components of the rotational diffusion tensor, obtained from hydrodynamic calculations using the bead method [36], is 1.00 : 0.92 : 0.83 for E-FABP. This suggests a small degree of anisotropy for the overall rotation of E-FABP, which can, in principle, be detected by NMR relaxation measurements [37]. Since the anisotropy of the rotational diffusion tensor is rather small, however, anisotropic modelling of the global motion does not result in a statistically significant improvement of the fit. Therefore the dynamics calculations were performed by applying an isotropic model in solution, as previously reported for bovine H-FABP and porcine ILBP [38]. Assuming isotropic motion, an estimate of the overall rotational correlation time c was derived using only residues with T (N) : " T (N) ratios that fall within one standard deviation of the mean # T (N) : T (N) ratio [39].

Backbone and side-chain (sc) amide assignments are shown for each residue. Due to spin-system heterogeneities, several residues display multiple backbone amide signals (not additionally labelled).

systems of almost the same intensity (representing separate, equally populated conformational states due to different bound fatty acids), one major form is always observed in the spectra of human E-FABP, since the protein had been complexed with only a single type of ligand molecule, i.e. stearic acid. Consequently, the spin-system heterogeneities observed around the portal region in human E-FABP may be due to the presence of a minor ligandfree protein form. All other cases of multiple spin-systems, however, are distributed randomly throughout the amino acid sequence, suggesting a different origin. The presence of six cysteine residues in the amino acid sequence of human E-FABP is highly unusual for LBPs. Four of the six cysteine residues are unique to the E-FABPs : Cys%$, Cys%(, Cys'( and Cys)(. The cysteine residues Cys"#! and Cys"#( of E-FABP are partially conserved in some LBPs, but only the M-FABP sequence includes both (at positions 117 and 124 respectively). In the 3D structure of E-FABP, two cysteine

residue pairs (Cys'(\Cys)( and Cys"#!\Cys"#() were identified by X-ray analysis to be close enough to allow disulphide bridge formation, but a disulphide bond was actually found only between Cys"#! and Cys"#( [17]. Since the exclusion of a disulphide bridge between Cys'( and Cys)( improved the Rfree factor of the crystallographical model, the existence of a covalent bond between these two side chains was considered unlikely. This is in agreement with the NMR data, where SH resonances have been observed for the cysteine residues Cys%$, Cys'( (tentative assignment) and Cys)(, thus excluding the possibility of a second disulphide bridge in solution.

The rest of the structure consists of a series of -strands : C (Leu&#­Glu&(), D (Thr'#­Thr')), E (Lys(#­Thr((), F (Arg)"­Phe)*), G (Leu*%­Glu**), H (Glu"!%­Leu"""), I (Leu""'­Val"#") and J (Thr"#'­Lys"$$), which are connected mostly by hairpin turns. For the 20 best E-FABP conformers, root-mean-square deH H viation (RMSD) values of 0.92p0.11 A and 1.46p0.10 A were determined for the backbone and heavy atoms respectively, excluding the terminal residues. Without the portal region (i.e. for residues 4­26, 40­56, 63­75 and 83­134), a backbone RMSD H of 0.85p0.10 A was obtained, thus reflecting the higher conformational dispersion in the portal region. Superposition with the X-ray structure of human E-FABP (excluding the terminal residues) yielded average backbone RMSD values of 1.00p H H 0.07 A for the entire residue range and 0.98p0.06 A without the portal region. This indicates a close similarity between the crystallographical and the solution structures. According to the Ramachandran plot, the backbone dihedral angles of residues within the major secondary structure elements show well-defined values with low standard deviations. A total of 99.3 % of all nonglycine\non-proline residues are found in the allowed regions of conformational space. Most of the cases found in the disallowed regions belong to Val% (N-terminus), Asp*" ( F­G turn) or Asn"#$ ( I­J turn), i.e. residues that might not be well-defined in the structure calculation due to rather exposed positions either in turns or at terminal ends.

tons observed. This interruption of the -sheet structure has been referred to as the ` gap ' region [14]. On the basis of the NOE and hydrogen-exchange data, an ensemble of 20 energy-minimized conformers representing the solution structure of human E-FABP complexed with stearic acid has been obtained. The analysis of homonuclear 2D NOESY and "&N-edited 3D NOESY spectra led to a total of 2926 NOEderived distance constraints. Furthermore, 37 slow-exchanging backbone amide protons were identified to be part of the hydrogen-bonding network in the -sheet and subsequently converted into 74 additional distance constraints. Finally, the disulphide bridge between Cys"#! and Cys"#( was defined by three upper and three lower distance bounds. The structure calculation program DYANA regarded 998 of these constraints as irrelevant, i.e. they did not restrict the distance between two protons. Out of the remaining 2008 non-trivial distance constraints, 371 were intraresidual (i l j ), 508 sequential ( Q i­jQ l 1), 233 mediumrange (1 Qi­jQ 4), and 896 long-range (Qi­jQ 4). Figure 3 shows the resulting ensemble of 20 conformers (left-hand and middle panels) as well as the ribbon diagram of the best DYANA structure after restrained energy minimization (right-hand panel). The structure co-ordinates have been deposited at the Research Collaboratory of Scientific Bioinformatics (` RCSB ') Protein Data Bank under the accession number 1JJJ. The numbers of experimental distance restraints and other structural statistics of the calculated conformers are listed in Table 1. The solution structure of human E-FABP consists of 10 antiparallel -strands, defining two nearly orthogonal -sheets of five -strands each, and two short -helices that form an helix-turnhelix domain. The centre of -strand F (Lys)#­Phe)*) is shared by both -sheets. The N-terminal residues Val%­Leu( form a helical loop (presumably 3 conformation), which leads to "! strand A (Gly*­Lys"().

Backbone dynamics of human E-FABP
In spite of the high degree of structural similarity, most members of the FABP family show marked functional differences. For example, the oleic acid-binding constants vary from 0.44 µM for human H-FABP to 0.82 µM for human E-FABP and 1 µM for human ILBP [47]. Since ligand binding may also be influenced by intrinsic dynamical properties of the protein, it is important to characterize the backbone dynamics of E-FABP. "&N longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates as well as heteronuclear NOE values of human holo E-FABP were measured at three different fields (500, 600 and 800 MHz). The experimental values of the relaxation rates R and R are shown in Figure 4. The " # numerical values of R , R and NOE are also listed in the supple" # mental material (available at http:\\www.BiochemJ.org\bj\364\ bj3640725add.htm), with the error of the NOE set to a constant value (0.03) for all residues. These data were subsequently combined and analysed for 120 of 132 backbone amide groups to yield the microdynamic parameters S#, e and Rex (Table 2), which provide information about the mobility of the backbone N­H bond vectors, the correlation time of local motion and the conformational exchange contribution to transverse relaxation respectively. Backbone amide order parameters were determined for all three fields combined, with a resulting molecular tumbling correlation time of c l 8.6 ns. Nearly all non-terminal backbone amide groups showed S# values 0.8, with an average value of 0.88p0.04 ; the same average S# value holds for the residues belonging to the secondary structure elements. As can be seen in Figure 5, S# values (representing backbone mobility within the nanosecond-to-picosecond timescale) show little correlation with secondary structure. Interestingly, the N-terminal helical loop and -helix I both exhibit above-average S# values, indicating reduced backbone mobility, whereas -helix II as part of the portal region displays a higher flexibility. Overall, however, the structure of human E-FABP shows a rather uniform

dynamic behaviour throughout the entire amino acid sequence. Therefore these data obtained for holo E-FABP suggest a protein backbone structure of relatively low flexibility (S# values 0.8 imply a cone semi-angle of 21m assuming the wobbling-in-acone model for the N­H vector motion). To better understand the influence of molecular dynamics processes on the functional properties of LBPs, the backbone dynamics data and hydrogen\deuterium exchange behaviour of human E-FABP are compared below with results reported previously for bovine H-FABP and porcine ILBP [38]. Since the "&N relaxation data of both H-FABP and ILBP had been obtained for the apo-forms, we decided to perform an additional hydrogen\deuterium exchange experiment with apo H-FABP for better comparability. Lassen et al. [23] have reported that 70

backbone amide protons displayed very slow exchange in bovine holo H-FABP over a period of several days at 310 K. For the apo-form, we now observed 39 such amide resonances after 4 days under identical conditions. This indicates a lower stability in the hydrogen-bonding network of the -sheet structure for the apo-form compared with H-FABP complexed with a fatty acid. Such a stabilizing effect due to ligand binding has also been reported previously in the case of porcine ILBP [21]. Still, the amide­proton-exchange behaviour within the -sheet is also unusually slow for apo H-FABP compared with other LBP types. Due to the fact that the LBP holo-forms are usually more stable than the apo-forms, as mentioned above, and due to the rather low stability of the E-FABP samples, we have chosen to

investigate human E-FABP in complex with stearic acid at a decreased temperature of 298 K. The comparison with the apoforms of H-FABP and ILBP [38] should nevertheless provide useful information about the relative conformational stabilities of these FABP types. First, human E-FABP is compared with bovine H-FABP. S# distributions of apo H-FABP and holo EFABP are rather similar, i.e. they show a uniform distribution throughout the amino acid sequence, indicating a relatively low flexibility within the entire backbone structure (average S# l 0.89p0.06 for apo H-FABP and 0.88p0.06 for holo E-FABP). However, E-FABP shows a much faster hydrogen exchange compared with H-FABP. For apo H-FABP, 49 slow-exchanging backbone amide protons involved in the hydrogen-bonding network of the -sheet structure were observed after 6 h in perdeuterated buffer at 310 K (Figure 6A), of which 39 remained detectable after 4 days. On the other hand, in the case of holo EFABP, only 37 amide proton resonance signals were observable after 2 h in perdeuterated solution at 298 K (Figure 6C), and just 13 signals were still detected after 2 days. Thus compared with apo H-FABP the hydrogen-bonding network in the -sheet structure of E-FABP is less stable even in the holo-form. Interestingly, in the case of holo E-FABP the analysis of the relaxation data led to Rex values for 47 residues (Figure 6D), the majority of which are located in the centre sections of the -strands where the slow-exchanging amide protons are also concentrated. This suggests a direct correlation between the slow exchange of backbone amide protons in the -sheet structure and the occurrence of Rex terms (representing exchange processes on the millisecond-to-microsecond timescale). For apo H-FABP, on the other hand, the occurrence of Rex terms is reduced to only eight residues, which are distributed rather randomly throughout the amino acid sequence (Figure 6B). Since apo H-FABP had been investigated at a considerably higher temperature [23], these results indicate a strongly decreased hydrogen exchange within the -sheet structure of apo H-FABP relative to holo E-FABP.
# 2002 Biochemical Society

Comparing the backbone dynamics data of human E-FABP with the previously reported results for porcine ILBP [38], however, presents a quite different scenario. In the case of apo ILBP, several non-terminal residues displayed strongly decreased S# values, suggesting a relatively high flexibility within certain regions of the backbone structure. In addition, an even faster hydrogen exchange was reported for apo ILBP [21] compared with that of holo E-FABP presented in the current study. For apo ILBP, merely 20 amide proton resonance signals remained detectable after only 30 min in perdeuterated solution at 310 K (Figure 6E), all of which disappeared completely after 4 h. ILBP in complex with chenodeoxycholate showed a slower hydrogen exchange relative to apo ILBP, with complete exchange of all backbone amide protons after 18 h at 310 K, thus implying a stabilizing effect induced by the bound ligand. Nevertheless, the exchange of the backbone amide resonances within the -sheet structure apparently proceeds faster for both apo and holo ILBP than in the cases of apo H-FABP or holo E-FABP, indicating a lower stability of the hydrogen-bonding network in ILBP. Moreover, Rex terms occur in apo ILBP for a total of 43 residues that are located mainly within the -strands (Figure 6F), suggesting that the exchange of backbone amide protons in this LBP may also be subjected to processes that take place within the millisecond-to-microsecond time range.

DISCUSSION
The solution structure of human E-FABP has been determined by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy on the basis of sequencespecific "H and "&N resonance assignments. Spin-system heterogeneities were observed for several amino acid residues, in some cases indicating separate backbone conformational states around the portal region. However, even though a weak electron density in the X-ray data of human E-FABP [17] suggested a less welldefined structure in the turn between -strands C and D

Figure 6 Backbone worm representation indicating slow-exchanging amide protons and non-zero conformational exchange parameter (Rex) values in different LBP family members
Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments and the microdynamic parameters obtained from 15 N relaxation analysis show significant differences in the chemical exchange with the solvent for the backbone amide protons. In bovine apo H-FABP (A and B), 49 slow-exchanging amide protons remained visible after 6 h at 310 K in 2H2O solution (A), whereas only 8 residues showed exchange parameters (B). For human holo E-FABP (C and D), 37 slow-exchanging amide protons were detected after 2 h at 298 K in 2H2O solution (C) and 47 residues with Rex terms occurred in the central -sheet (D). Porcine apo ILBP (E and F) exhibited 20 slowexchanging amide protons after 30 min at 310 K in 2H2O solution (E) and 43 residues with exchange parameters (F). Human holo E-FABP appears to rank between apo H-FABP and apo ILBP in the hydrogen/deuterium exchange, with Rex terms in the -strands indicating exchange in the millisecond-to-microsecond timescale. Clearly, the hydrogen-bonding network in the -sheet structure of holo E-FABP is less stable relative to apo H-FABP. Rex values, red ; slow-exchanging amide protons (H/D exchange), yellow. Produced using the program GRASP [60].

(comprising residues 58­61 as part of the portal region), no spinsystem heterogeneities were observed for these particular residues in the solution structure, thus excluding separate long-lived conformational states as reported for H-FABP [45]. On the other hand, a more ` diffuse ' structure in the C­D turn, together with a lack of the otherwise highly conserved Phe&( ring as a portal lid, might possibly explain the relatively low oleic acidbinding affinity of E-FABP compared with other FABPs in the LBP subfamily IV [47].

Furthermore, on the basis of the proton chemical shift assignment, the presence of a second disulphide bridge in human E-FABP can definitely be ruled out. The cystine bond, which has been detected between Cys"#! and Cys"#( by the previous X-ray study [17], is unique in the LBP family. Even though biochemical studies have indicated that the respective residues Cys""( and Cys"#% in M-FABP are disulphide linked as well [48], their S H positions are too far apart (4.5 A) in the crystal structure for the presence of a disulphide bridge [49]. A comparison with the EFABP structure provides no obvious explanation for this structural discrepancy observed between these two members of LBP subfamily IV, except maybe for the lower atomic resolution H (2.7 A) of the M-FABP data. Still, the high structural homology of this cysteine residue pair strongly suggests the presence of a cystine bond in M-FABP as well, and therefore poses the question why this is not seen in the crystal structure. The overall structural fold of human E-FABP in solution is very similar to the solution structures of other members of the LBP family, such as H-FABP [23,45], ILBP [21], I-FABP [50,51], as well as cellular retinoic acid-binding protein type II [52] and cellular retinol-binding protein types I and II [53,54]. The presence of an N-terminal helical loop, however, is a unique attribute of the LBP subfamily IV. The loop usually consists of four residues, starting with a hydrophobic amino acid, followed by one or two hydrophilic residues and a highly conserved phenylalanine residue (substituted by a leucine residue only in the case of E-FABP) in the last position. The non-polar residues in the first and last position are part of the hydrophobic cluster at the bottom of the protein cavity, whereas the hydrophilic residues are accessible to the external solvent. This additional structural feature in LBP subfamily IV might therefore contribute to the overall stability of the -barrel fold. Marked differences in conformational stability and binding affinity for fatty acids have been reported for paralogous FABPs of LBP subfamily IV [47,55]. In all types of this subgroup, the fatty acid inside the cavity is bound in a U-shaped conformation with hydrogen-bond formation between the carboxylate group and a triad of protein side chains consisting of two arginine residues (one via an ordered water molecule) and one tyrosine residue (E-FABP numbering Arg"!*, Arg"#* and Tyr"$"). Among these FABP types, E-FABP displays the lowest conformational stability in the presence of urea, in spite of the existence of a unique disulphide bridge. Furthermore, E-FABP shows the second lowest binding affinity for oleic acid after A-FABP. In contrast, H-FABP exhibits a very stable conformation and strong ligand binding. A cluster of hydrophobic side chains, which closes the end of the -barrel structure that is located opposite to the helix-turn-helix domain, might play a significant role in both ligand binding and protein stability. Several members of this hydrophobic cluster are substituted in E-FABP (relative to H-FABP) by residues with different hydrophobicities : Leu( (Phe%), Phe'& (Ile'#), Cys'( (Phe'%), Cys)( (Val)%) and Phe)* (Leu)'). This might, in part, explain the decreased conformational stability of E-FABP, whereas other substitutions, like Leu'! (Phe&() and Val"") (Leu""&), could be responsible for the weaker binding of fatty acids to E-FABP. Significant differences in the backbone dynamics between bovine H-FABP and porcine ILBP have been reported previously on the basis of hydrogen\deuterium exchange [21,23] and "&N relaxation experiments [38]. The extremely slow amide­protonexchange behaviour observed for H-FABP indicated a clear distinction in the stability of the hydrogen-bonding network between these two -barrel proteins. Hence, both the hydrogen\ deuterium exchange behaviour and the microdynamic parameters may provide valuable information about the influence of

molecular dynamic processes on the functional aspects of different LBPs. The backbone dynamics data of human E-FABP were, for this purpose, compared with both bovine H-FABP and porcine ILBP. The dynamics behaviour of E-FABP contrasts, for example, with that of ILBP [38], which shows a larger spread in the S# values and several non-terminal residues, with S# values well below 0.7. Yet, other members of the LBP family also exhibit distinct patterns of backbone dynamics. It has been reported, for example, that A-FABP has a greater backbone mobility than HFABP, especially in the portal region [56]. This is due to the fact that A-FABP has lower S# values in the portal region, whereas H-FABP shows higher S# values distributed uniformly throughout the amino acid sequence. For I-FABP, on the other hand, a very high mobility around the portal region has been described [57], even though the S# values for some residues in this region were abnormally low. Summarizing the results on protein dynamics obtained in the present study, it can be concluded that the different LBP family members E-FABP, H-FABP and ILBP are characterized by varying stabilities in the protein backbone structures. Hydrogen\ deuterium exchange experiments presented significant differences in the chemical exchange with the solvent, for the backbone amide protons belonging to the hydrogen-bonding network in the -sheets. The -barrel structure of H-FABP appears to be the most rigid, with exchange processes presumably slower than the millisecond-to-microsecond time range. ILBP, on the other hand, shows the fastest hydrogen exchange as well as a significant number of Rex terms, implying a decreased stability in the -sheet structure. Finally, E-FABP appears to rank between these two proteins on the basis of the hydrogen\deuterium exchange, with Rex terms in the -strands indicating millisecond-to-microsecond exchange processes like in ILBP. According to biochemical data [47], the conformational stabilities of the human paralogues H-FABP, ILBP and E-FABP decrease in this order, which is partially in contrast with the results described in the present study. However, both studies agree that, within LBP subfamily IV, the H-FABP has a much more rigid structure than E-FABP. Differences in the arrangement of the hydrophobic cluster inside the protein cavity, in particular the replacement of Phe% (H-FABP) by Leu( (E-FABP), may be responsible for this distinction. Moreover, the higher conformational stability of H-FABP may also be related to the tighter binding of fatty acid ligands to H-FABP relative to EFABP [47]. Possibly, there is a correlation between protein stability and ligand-binding affinity, if a more flexible structure allows the bound ligand to leave the binding cavity more easily. On the other hand, the lack of the highly conserved phenylalanine portal lid (Phe&( in H-FABP) in E-FABP could be the predominant factor for the lower fatty acid-binding affinities of the latter protein. Future site-directed mutagenesis studies on human E-FABP may provide definite answers to the questions posed above. Moreover, additional NMR investigations on the dynamics of other intracellular LBPs will be needed for a more concise interpretation of the distinctions in binding affinity and specificity. Finally, the determination of the solution structure of human E-FABP now permits further studies on intermolecular interactions, in particular with S100A7 in regard to psoriasis.
