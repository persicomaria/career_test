X-ray crystallography revealed that the exocyclic amino group participated in a hydrogen bonding array with the two catalytic aspartic acids of BACE-1 (Asp32, Asp228). BACE-1 inhibitory potency was increased (0.9 µM to 11 nM Ki) by substitution into the unoccupied S1 pocket.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, resulting in severe cognitive deficits along with psychiatric complications.1 More than 20 million individuals suffer from this condition worldwide, and this number is expected to grow dramatically. The current standards of care are the cholinesterase inhibitors such as galantamine, which are indicated for mild to moderate AD, and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine for the moderate to severe form of the disease. A compelling molecular target among the various strategies being pursued2 is the aspartic

protease BACE-1.3 This membrane bound type 1 protein catalyzes the initial proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APPa) en route to the -amyloid1-40(42) peptides. The mouse homozygous knock-out shows significant reduction of -amyloid levels,4 and this gene deletion in the Tg2576 animal model of -amyloid overexpression results in the attenuation of the cognitive deficit.5 BACE-1 has also recently been shown to play a role in myelination in the peripheral and central nervous system during development and may have cognitive and synaptic functions independent of APP processing.6 Nevertheless, BACE-1 inhibitors have been shown to lower -amyloid levels in the brains of mice7 and thus may treat the etiology of the disease and not just the symptoms.

A screen of our corporate compound collection resulted in the identification of a variety of hits in the 1-10 µM range. We focused SAR development on 2-aminoquinazoline 1, which

inhibited BACE-1 with a 0.9 µM Ki (Table 1). An X-ray structure of 1 bound into the BACE-1 protein was obtained as part of a collaboration with Astex Therapeutics. The BACE-1 protein used in the crystallography studies was prepared by recombinant insect cell expression.8 The structure of 1 in the active site of BACE-1 was compact, with the side chain bending back onto itself in a hairpin turn orientation (Figure 1). This allowed the N-cyclohexyl substituent to occupy the critical S1 binding pocket. In addition, the flap region of the protein adopted an "open" structure in which the Tyr71CR carbon is displaced by 4 Å relative to the peptidic OM99-29 bound into BACE-1. Similar flexibility has been observed for the flap region of other aspartyl proteases such as renin and HIV-1 protease. An especially intriguing feature of this structure is the exquisite hydrogen bonding array that 1 forms with the two catalytic aspartates (Asp32, Asp228; Figure 2). Related 2-aminopyridines, 2,3-diaminopyridines, 1-aminoisoquinolines, and 2-aminoquinolines have been identified by the use of a fragmentscreening approach as BACE-1 inhibitors.10 To reinforce the hairpin conformation in the side chain, we prepared 2, which bears a 1,3-disubstituted phenyl ring in the side chain. This modification also incorporated 6-phenoxy substitution instead of the 6-benzoyl group present in 1. A 6-fold increase in potency for BACE-1 inhibition was observed for 2 (158 nM Ki) when compared with 1. Further examination of

the X-ray structure of 1 bound into BACE-1 revealed that the vacant hydrophobic S1 pocket could be filled by substitution with S stereochemistry on the R-carbon of the side chain. Compound 3 was prepared as a racemate initially and was found to be a potent BACE-1 inhibitor (30 nM Ki). The enantiomers of 3 were obtained independently, and the activity resided predominantly in the S enantiomer as predicted (3a, 11 nM Ki, Figure 2). Chemistry. 2-Amino-3,4-dihydroquinazoline 1 was prepared starting with the conversion of ethyl cyanoacetate 4 into amide 5, which afforded amine 6 after reduction (Scheme 1). Reductive amination of 3-benzoyl-6-nitrobenzaldehyde 711 and 6 provided benzyl amine 8. Reduction of the nitro group of 8 followed by

treatment with cyanogen bromide led to 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazoline 1. The preparation of 2 was initiated by conversion of 9 to amide 10 and deprotection to provide 11 (Scheme 2). Nitrobenzaldehyde 12 was converted to phenoxy derivative 13.12 Reductive amination of 13 and 11 afforded benzylamine 14, which was converted to aminoquinazoline 2. The chemistry to prepare 3 (racemic) started with amidation of ketoacid 1513 to give 16, followed by reductive amination to afford primary amine 17 (Scheme 3). Conversion to target 3 was conducted by the use of the same sequence as for 1 and 2. The single enantiomers of 3 were obtained via a synthetic strategy to prepare -substituted--aminoacids devised by Smrcina and Majer,14 which resulted in no detectable epimerization on a reaction scale of up to 200 g.

For the preparation of 3a, (R)-cyclohexylglycine 18 (>97% e.e.) was treated with Meldrum's acid under basic conditions to afford 19, and the ketone functionality of 19 was subsequently reduced with NaBH4 to provide 20. Thermolysis of 20 provided lactam 21, which was saponified to 22, suitable for further homologation to 3a (Scheme 4). Pharmacology. Compound 3a was further examined in a variety of assays to probe selectivity and suitability for further consideration as a lead. It displayed modest selectivity for BACE-1 over the aspartic proteases renin (2.7 µM IC50) and cathepsin D (0.11 µM IC50) as well as the hERG channel (0.14 µM IC50). The Caco-2 apparent permeability coefficients PappA to B and PappB to A values for compound 3a were determined to be 0.28 × 10-6 cm/s and 3.38 × 10-6 cm/s, respectively. The efflux ratio of 12.2 suggests that this compound is a PgP substrate, although testing against PgP itself would need to be done to confirm this hypothesis. Compound 3a exhibited excellent potency in a cellular assay, which measures the inhibition of A 1-40 secretion in CHO cells transfected with the Swedish familial AD mutant APP (K670N/M671L). Additionally, 3a lowered -amyloid1-40 in plasma by 40-70% in rats after p.o. administration (30 mg/kg), 3 h post-dosing. Discussion. A variety of compounds have been reported that inhibit BACE-1.3,15 Many of these are statine-like pseudotransition state inhibitors, and others have more dramatically altered chemotypes such as the 2-aminoheterocycles recently reported10 that are similar to the 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazolines disclosed here. Considerable computational work has also been conducted examining the BACE-1 active site in an effort to design more potent inhibitors or add suitable substitution to address ADME or other liabilities.16 There were several very distinctive features of our 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazoline chemotype. The 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazolines adopted a compact structure bearing a hairpin turn of the side chain and anchored at the active site by virtue of an extensive hydrogen bonding array of the two catalytic aspartic acids with the exocyclic amino group. As a consequence, the protein flap over the active site was pushed away by a distance of about 4 Å when compared to the structure of OM99-2 (peptidic inhibitor) bound in to BACE-1. Because only the S1 pocket of the protein was filled with initial 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazoline ligand 1 we were able to explicitly design several modifications that served to improve potency. The hairpin turn was accommodated by the incorporation of a structural constraint (e.g., 2), and the S1 pocket was filled by (S)-R-(c-C6H12) substitution. Conclusion. The 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazoline substructure is a new fragment for aspartic protease inhibition such as

against BACE-1, which is an important target in the search for new Alzheimer's disease treatments. The exocyclic amino group was shown to be involved in a hydrogen bonding array with the two aspartic acids at the BACE-1 active site. X-ray crystallography analysis of 1 (0.9 µM Ki) bound in to BACE-1 was critical in allowing us to design additional analogs with improved potency. For example, because the side chain of 1 adopted an energetically unfavored hairpin conformation, 1,3phenyl disubstituted derivative 2 was prepared, which displayed improved potency (158 nM Ki) relative to 1. Careful analysis of the structure of 1 bound into BACE-1 revealed that the S1 pocket could be accessed by (S)-R-substitution off of the side chain, so we designed and prepared by (S)-R-(c-C6H11) derivative 3a, which had excellent potency for BACE-1 inhibition (11 nM Ki). These structural modifications (2 and 3a) would not have been given high priority for synthesis without the insight provided by the crystal structure of 1 bound in to BACE1. We were able to transition from a micromolar hit to a nanomolar lead suitable for extensive SAR development by the use of ligand-BACE-1 crystallographic analysis. Acknowledgment.
