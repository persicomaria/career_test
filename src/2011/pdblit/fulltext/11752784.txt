An acidic phospholipase A2 was puri®ed from Deinagkistrodon acutus (Agkistrodon acutus) which displays an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. The threedimensional structure of the enzyme was determined by Ê molecular replacement at 2.6 A resolution with a crystallographic R factor of 18.40% (Rfree = 22.50%) and reasonable stereochemistry. Two molecules in the asymmetric unit form a dimer and the dimer formation accompanies a signi®cant conformational adaptation of segment 14±23, a constituent of the `interface recognition site' (IRS). This probably re¯ects the inherent structural ¯exibility of the IRS. The possible expansion of the site for inhibiting platelet aggregation as proposed previously [Wang et al. (1996), J. Mol. Biol. 255, 669±676] is discussed.

1. Introduction
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2; E.C. 3.1.1.4) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the fatty acid ester at the sn-2 position of phospholipids in a calcium-dependent reaction. The secretory PLA2s are classi®ed into two main groups based on sequence and structural homology. In addition to being a catalyst for the hydrolysis of phospholipids, PLA2s from snake venoms possess a wide variety of pharmacological activities (Gowda et al., 1994; Betzel et al., 1999) such as neurotoxicity, haemolytic activity, cardiotoxicity, myotoxicity and anticoagulant and antiplatelet activities. The activity of phospholipase A2 on substrates presenting multimolecular aggregates has long been known to be two or three orders of magnitude higher than on monomolecular dispersed molecules (interfacial activation). Large numbers of studies focusing on this phenomenon have produced two complementary theories (Derewenda, 1995). The `substrate theory' states that the substrate properties are responsible for the phenomenon (Wells et al., 1974; Scott, White et al., 1990; Peters et al., 1995). The `enzyme theory' argues that phospholipase A2 undergoes a signi®cant conformational change (allosteric activity) when binding to an oil/water interface (van den Berg, Tessari, Boelens, Dijkman, de Haas et al., 1995; Berg et al., 1997). The molecular mechanism behind this activation has been investigated for free PLA2s as well as PLA2 complexes using both NMR (van den Berg, Tessari, Boelens, Dijkman, de Haas et al., 1995; van den Berg, Tessari, Boelens, Dijkman, Kaptein et al., 1995; van den Berg, Tessari, de Haas et al., 1995; Jerala et al., 1996; Yuan et al., 1999) and X-ray crystallographic methods (Scott, Otwinowski et al., 1990; Scott, White et al., 1990; Dijkstra et al., 1983; Thunnissen et al., 1990; White et al., 1990). The NMR studies suggest that group I PLA2s show signi®cant

conformational differences in the `interface recognition site' (IRS) of the free structure and the complexed structure. However, crystallographic studies demonstrate that as one of the most rigid proteins in nature, PLA2s rarely show signi®cant IRS conformational ¯exibility, suggesting that the substrate properties play the pivotal role in interfacial activity. In this paper, we report a crystal structure of a group II PLA2 with remarkable conformational differences in a segment concerning the IRS. This crystallographic result favours the `enzyme theory' of interface activation. Four PLA2s from the venom of the ®ve-pace snake D. acutus (A. acutus) were obtained through gene engineering (Liu et al., 2000). The amino-acid sequences of these PLA2s were determined using the cDNA method (Liu et al., 1999). They were designated acidic phospholipase A2I (aPLA2I), acidic phospholipase A2II (aPLA2II), basic phospholipase A2 (bPLA2) and Lys49-phospholipase A2 (Lys49PLA2) according to their isoelectric points, which are 4.49, 5.05, 9.49 and 9.3, respectively. aPLA2I has an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation, and all the phospholipase A2s except aPLA2II have haemolytic activities. aPLA2I is the only known member of the acidic PLA2s which exhibits haemolytic activity. An acidic PLA2 recently puri®ed from the venom of D. acutus and characterized by Zhang et al. (2000) also displays an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. In this paper, we report the Ê crystal structure determination of this PLA2 at 2.6 A resolution and analyze the platelet site based on a comparison of the amino-acid sequences and the three-dimensional structures.

The structure was solved by the molecular-replacement method using the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Ê Project, Number 4, 1994). A 4 A self-rotation function search using the POLARRFN program revealed a prominent peak (7.5') for 1 = 180 , indicating the presence of a non-

The PLA2 enzyme provided for crystallization was extracted from the venom of D. acutus (collected from Jiangxi Province, China) according to the procedure outlined previously (Zhang et al., 2000). The enzyme showed signi®cant catalytic activity. Crystals were grown at 291 K by the hangingdrop method with 10 mg mlÀ1 protein, 0.05 M HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 0.07 M NaCl and 12% MPD in 8 ml drops equilibrated against 0.5 ml of well solution consisting of 0.1 M HEPES buffer pH 7.5 and 70% MPD. Single crystals with dimensions of 0.10 Â 0.15 Â 0.25 mm were found in the drops after four weeks. The crystals belong to space group P21, with unit-cell Ê parameters a = 48.71, b = 38.00, c = 69.90 A,  = 99.35 . There are two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystal Ê has a 46% estimated solvent content (VM = 2.28 A3 DaÀ1; Matthews, 1968). The detailed crystallization procedure and preliminary X-ray characterization of the crystal have been reported elsewhere (Zhang et al., 2000). Data were collected on a MAR 345 area detector (MAR Ê Research; ! = 1.54178 A) using a single crystal at a temperature of 293 K. The crystal-to-detector distance was 150 mm. The total rotation range 9 was from 45 to 275 with an oscillation angle Á9 of 1 and an exposure time of 540 s per frame. The data were scaled and merged using the HKL suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The data set has an Rmerge of

crystallographic twofold symmetry axis, which is perpendicular to the b axis and deviates 13.1 from the c axis. It is assumed that the acidic PLA2 enzyme studied here has the same sequence as the aPLA2I sequence deduced using the cDNA method (the aPLA2I sequence is hereafter called the reference sequence). The search model used in the crossrotation function calculation was acidic PLA2 from the venom of A. halys pallas (Wang, Yang et al., 1996; PDB code 1psj), with a sequence identity of 70.2% compared with the reference sequence. All residues from the search model (124 in total) were used and the residues that differed between the two sequences were initially treated as alanines. The crossrotation function search was calculated using the AMoRe program (Navaza, 1994) with data in the resolution range Ê Ê 8±4 A and an integration radius of 19 A. The top eight peaks of the cross-rotation function were used to calculate the translation functions. The translation function showed that the ®rst and the third peaks were the correct solutions from their high correlation coef®cients. The rigid-body re®nement of AMoRe resulted in an R factor of 38.6% and a correlation value of 56.7%. The initial model, oriented and positioned according to the molecular-replacement solution, was examined on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation using the program FRODO/TURBO (Jones, 1978). The molecular packing in the crystal was con®rmed to be reasonable and consistent with the result of the self-rotation function. The re®nement was carried out using the X-PLOR program È (Brunger, 1992a) followed by the CNS program (Brunger et al., 1998), with 10% of the data reserved to calculate the free R È factor (Brunger, 1992b). A total of 7703 re¯ections in the Ê resolution range 8.0±2.6 A were used in the re®nement. The main chains and side chains of the molecules were adjusted according to the 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron-density maps. Four inconsistencies in sequence were found at positions 102, 103, 131 and 133, where the electron density was not adequate for the side chains of the reference sequence. We changed these residues to Ala102, Ala103, Pro131 and Pro133, respectively. We also inserted a proline as residue 122 according to the electron-density map. These changes are consistent with the sequence of Taiwan D. acutus acidic PLA2 deduced from the cDNA sequence (Wang, Wang et al., 1996). Finally, two calcium ions, a zinc ion and 94 water molecules were included in the model based on their electron densities and environments. After several cycles of atomic position and B-factor re®nements, the ®nal R value fell to 18.40% with an Rfree value Ê of 22.50% in the resolution range 8.0±2.6 A. The ®nal model has good stereochemical quality, with the r.m.s. deviations from ideal values Ê being 0.007 A for bond lengths and 1.22 for bond angles. The C r.m.s. differences calculated Figure 2 Ribbon digram of the dimer structure. The -wing, C-terminus ridge, calcium ion and between the ®nal model and the search model some residues at the interface are labelled. Ê Ê were 0.920 A for molecule A and 1.515 A for molecule B. Calculations using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) indicated that almost all non-glycine and non-proline residues in the asymmetric unit were located in the most favoured regions (173 residues) or the additional allowed regions (27 residues), with only one in the general allowed regions. The Ramachandran plot of the main-chain torsion angles (9, 2) (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) showed that 86.1% of the residues were in the most favoured regions, with none of the residues in the disallowed regions (Fig. 1). The re®nement results are listed in Table 1.

ion and 94 water molecules. These atoms occupied 56.1% of the unit-cell volume. The 2Fo À Fc electron-density map is continuous and well de®ned for both the backbone and the side chains with the exception of a very small number of polar side chains on the molecule surface. As a member of the group II PLA2s (Heinrikson et al., 1977; Dufton & Hider, 1983), D. acutus acidic PLA2 has all the structural characteristics of this group of PLA2. It contains three long -helices, one double-stranded antiparallel -sheet designated as a -wing and a calcium-binding loop (Fig. 2). These structural elements as well as the C-terminal ridge are cross-linked by seven disul®de bonds. The structures of the active site and the hydrophobic channel are also highly conserved. The calcium ion binds at the highly conserved calcium-binding loop and the ligand O atoms form the usual distorted pentagonal bipyramidal structure. In this experiment, no calcium ions were added to the crystallization solutions; however, a strong electron-density peak at the expected calcium ion position around the calcium-binding loop indicated the presence of a calcium ion. Similar cases have been reported (see Wang, Yang et al. 1996). The two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit form a dimer with approximate twofold symmetry (Fig. 2). The dimer is stabilized by a large number of hydrophobic interactions and 12 direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The surface Ê area buried by the formation of the dimer is 983 A2 (CCP4; Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994), corresponding to 15.9% of the monomer surface area, a value close to that of a typical dimer (Janin et al., 1988). Such dimers also exist in a novel crystal form (Gu et al., unpublished results). Although the crystallization solution did not contain any additional metal ions except for Na+, the Fo À Fc electrondensity map displayed a signi®cant isolated peak with ' > 6 near His34, indicating the presence of a second metal ion. This metal ion was coordinated by two histidine residues at position 34 from two adjacent dimers and two water molecules, with the ligands forming a distorted tetrahedral structure. The ligand chemistry suggests that the ion may be Zn2+. It is not unusual for snake venom to contain minor amounts of metal ions including Zn2+ (Friederich & Tu, 1971). A similar Zn2+-coordinated structure was reported in another protein from D. acutus venom, acutolysin-C, which was also crystallized in the absence of the additional Zn2+ ions (Zhu et al., 1999). In the ®nal model, the residue sequence differs from the reference sequence (Liu et al., 1999) at ®ve positions. Three of these ®ve differences involve prolines, thus forming a proline-rich C-terminus ridge (Fig. 3) as in the PLA2 from the venom of Crotalus atrox (Brunie et al., 1985). The difference between the X-ray sequence and the reference sequence implies that the reference sequence based on cloning of the PLA2 may be derived from a mutant of the PLA2 in the venom, which differs slightly from that isolated for this study. The X-ray sequence reported here is very similar to that of Taiwan D. acutus acidic PLA2, with sequence differences of only 5.7%, indicating the proximity of D. acutus acidic PLA2 from Jiangxi and Taiwan.

As a small protein containing seven disul®de bridges, the PLA2 molecule shows resistance to denaturation (heat or hydrochloride guanidine; see Wu et al., 1985; Scott, 1997) and conformational in¯exibility. Usually, its conformations are affected little by its crystal environment. Unexpectedly, in this crystal structure the two molecules in the asymmetric unit greatly differ at the dimer interface (Figs. 2, 4a and 4b), where the structure is very

distances between equivalent C atoms after least-squares superposition of the two molecules. The greatest differences Ê Atom in Atom in Distance (>1.0 A for the C atoms) are con®ned to three segments Ê molecule A molecule B (A) consisting of residues 14±23, 77±80 and 85±91, with the largest Ê deviation at residue 19 (8.19 A for its C atom). By omitting Glu6 OE2 Glu6 OE1 2.40 Ser17 OG Glu6 OE2 2.37 these three stretches of peptides from the superposition, the Met19 N Glu6 OE2 3.36 Ê C atom r.m.s. deviation was reduced to 0.48 A. Met19 O Ser23 OG 3.13 Segment 14±23 is located at the interface of the dimer Phe20 O Trp31 NE1 2.79 Arg120 NH2 Tyr121 O 2.73 (Fig. 2). This segment connects the ®rst long -helix and the calcium-binding loop. In molecule A the segment includes a short -helix (17±22), while in molecule B it shows an irregular turn conformation. Structural comparison shows that in this reliable as shown by the well de®ned 2Fo À Fc electron-density region the conformation of molecule A is typical of PLA2s, maps (Figs. 5a and 5b). The superposition of the two molecules Ê while that of molecule B is unusual. The breakdown of twofold gives an r.m.s. deviation of 1.31 A for all C atoms, in contrast Ê symmetry at the interface results in asymmetrical hydrogento a value of 0.5 A or less in normal cases. Fig. 6(a) shows the bond interactions between the contact residues (Table 2). The conformation of segment 14±23 in molecule B is less stable than that in A as shown by its higher average crystallographic B factors (Fig. 6b) and fewer intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions compared with molecule A (seven hydrogen bonds in A but only four in B). A hypothetical dimer with strict twofold symmetry created using molecule A as a monomer had extensive short contacts at the dimer interface. To avoid the close contact, Trp21 was rotated about 180 around its CÐC bond, leading to great changes in the course of the main chains and the orientation of the aromatic side chains of residues 20 and 21 and the hydrophobic side chain of Met19. Signi®cant conformational changes extended as far as residue 16. Normally, segment 14±23 contains a short -helix as shown in molecule A. This work shows that the conformation of the segment can adapt on binding to a contacting molecule. This result is consistent with a recent NMR study of PLA2 (Yuan et al., 1999), which showed the absence of the short -helix 17±22 in the solution structure. It is also consistent with a newly reported crystallographic study of bovine pancreatic PLA2, in which the asymmetric unit contained a monomer and both the main chains and the side chains of residues 19±20 and 23±24 were wholly in double conformation (Steiner et al., 2001). The structure observed here suggests that the conformation of the segment in molecule B may resemble that in solution owing to the absence of the short -helix. This is not unexpected, as the segment is marginally stabilized by the main-chain hydrogen bonds in the short -helix (®ve residues long) and therefore its structure could change depending on the environment. Segment 14±23 together with the C-terminus ridge 110±134 involve a great number of residues at the IRS Figure 5 (Dijkstra et al., 1981). The C-terminus ridge Stereoview of the 2Fo À Fc electron-density map contoured at the 1.0' level showing usually shows higher B factors relative to the the region around segment 14±23 of molecule A (a) and molecule B (b).

entire molecule in most PLA2 crystal structures including the D. acutus aPLA2 structure being reported here, which indicates its ¯exibility. Taken together with previous results for group I PLA2s (Yuan et al., 1999; Steiner et al., 2001), we suggest that the ¯exibility of the IRS may be a common feature of PLA2 and the `allosteric activity' during the enzyme±oil/water interface interaction may require this ¯exibility. In addition to segment 14±23, differences between the two independent molecules were also observed for segments 85±91 and 77±80. Segment 85±91 is a stretch of peptide connecting the -wing and the third long -helix. Least-squares superposition of the A. halys pallas aPLA2 molecule onto both molecules A and B of D. acutus aPLA2 resulted in deviations Ê of the equivalent C atoms of this segment of less than 0.8 A for B, but being much higher for A, with a largest deviation of Ê more than 4.2 A for the residue 86 C atom. Careful examination showed that this region in molecule A is in contact with a neighbouring molecule, while in molecule B it is exposed to the solvent environment. This suggests that the conformation of this region in molecule B is native (in fact, it is similar to other PLA2s), while in molecule A it may be affected by interactions with other molecules. The segment 77±80 forms the tip of the -wing, which is known to be ¯exible (Arni & Ward, 1996).
3.3. The putative antiplatelet site

The crystallography and site-directed mutation study of acidic PLA2 from the venom of A. halys pallas suggested that an aromatic cluster (Phe20, Trp21, Phe113 and Trp119) and two acidic residues (Glu6 and Asp115) located on opposite sides of the cluster play important roles in the inhibition of platelet aggregation (Wang, Yang et al., 1996; Liu et al., 2001). Figure 6 (a) Distances between C pairs of molecules A and B along the Fig. 7 shows that D. acutus aPLA2 also has the same aromatic polypeptide chain. The average r.m.s. deviation for all the C pairs is cluster and Glu6 on one side as in A. halys pallas aPLA2; Ê 1.31 A. The signi®cant differences in segments 14±23 are clearly shown. however, the charge distribution on the other side of this (b) Plot of the temperature factor as a function of residue number for cluster is different: the three charged residues Asp115, Lys116 molecule A (thick line) and molecule B (thin line). and Lys117 are replaced by Ser115, Asp116 and Thr117. Biochemical research has indicated that D. acutus aPLA2 also has an effect on platelet aggregation. Since Asp115 is indispensable for A. halys pallas aPLA2 platelet aggregation activity and Asp116 in D. acutus aPLA2 is in close proximity to Asp115, Asp116 in D. acutus aPLA2 probably plays a similar role to that of Asp115. Therefore, the platelet aggregation inhibition site may be expanded to include residue 116. Moreover, although both A. halys pallas aPLA2 and D. acutus aPLA2 affect platelet aggregation, their effects differ. The A. halys pallas aPLA2 shows a class B effect on platelet aggregation, while the D. acutus aPLA2 may belong to class C (Chen & Chen, 1989; Kini & Evans, 1997). It would be interesting to see if this Figure 7 classi®cation has any relation to the special Comparison of the putative site responsible for inhibiting platelet aggregation.
