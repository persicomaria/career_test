The binding of multivalent antigen-antibody complexes to receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcgR) induces the clustering of the FcgR and triggers cell activation leading to defence reactions against pathogens. The Fc portion of IgG consists of two identical polypeptide chains which are related to each other by a 2-fold axis and are folded in two structural domains, the CH2 domain, near the ¯exible hinge region of the IgG molecule, and the CH3 domain. We studied the interaction in solution between the Fc fragment of mouse IgG2b and the extracellular region of mouse FcgRII. We ®nd that one Fc molecule binds one FcgRII molecule only. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that FcgRII binds to a negatively charged area of the CH2 domain, corresponding to the lower hinge region, and that the binding of FcgRII onto one of the two symmetrically related sites on the Fc induces a conformational change in the other site. We therefore propose a model that explains why IgG molecules are unable to trigger FcgR-mediated cellular responses spontaneously in the absence of crosslinking by multivalent antigens.

Introduction
Fcg receptors (FcgR) are a heterogeneous family of membrane glycoproteins that bind the Fc portion of IgG (Fridman et al., 1992; Gavin et al., 1998). They have been classi®ed into three basic types: FcgRI, FcgRII and FcgRIII. FcgRI have a high af®nity for monomeric IgG while FcgRII and FcgRIII have low af®nity for monomeric IgG but bind avidly IgG-containing immune complexes. The crosslinking of FcgR-bound IgG by multivalent antigens or the interaction of preformed immune complexes with FcgR allows clustering of the FcgR and initiates a variety of effector mechanisms, such as phagocytosis, the release of in¯ammatory mediators and antibody-dependent cell mediated

cytotoxicity. By linking humoral and cell-mediated responses, FcgR therefore plays a key role in defence against pathogens. Characterization of the Fcg-FcgR interactions should allow a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the defence reactions and may provide a basis for the design of molecules which could be used for therapy of FcgR-dependent in¯ammatory and autoimmune diseases (Clarkson et al., 1986; Clynes & Ravetch, 1995; Hazenbos et al., 1996). The Fc region is separated from the antigen binding parts of the IgG molecule by a ¯exible hinge region. It forms two structural domains, the CH2 domain, near the hinge region, and the CH3 domain at the C terminus of the IgG molecule. The IgG-FcgR interactions have been traditionally examined by cellular immunological techniques. By use of genetically engineered IgGs, a four amino acid sequence spanning residues 234 to 237 of the CH2 domain, located in the lower hinge region, has been identi®ed as the major binding site for all FcgR (Duncan et al., 1988; Lund et al., 1991, 1992; Sarmay et al., 1992; Morgan et al., 1995). The existence of additional FcgR-binding site(s) on

214 the Fc region has also been proposed, some located also in the CH2 domain, others in the CH3 domain (Diamond et al., 1985; Gergely & Sarmay, 1990; Can®eld & Morrison, 1991; Chappel et al., 1991; Lund et al., 1992; Greenwood et al., 1993). However, no unequivocal conclusion has been drawn, mainly because of the lack of structural information on the Fc-FcgR complexes. Recently, two distinct models of the FcgR-IgG complex have been proposed on the basis of the crystal structure of human FcgRII. In the working model by Sonderman et al. (1999a), the two FcgR molecules bind symetrically to one IgG molecule and the contact involves the interface region between the CH2 and CH3 domains of the Fc portion, whereas Maxwell et al. (1999) predict that FcgR molecules form dimers which interact with IgG asymmetrically, the contact involving the lower hinge regions of both IgG heavy chains and one FG loop from the CH2 domain. Since the Fc portion of IgG is composed of two identical polypeptide chains, which are related to each other by a 2-fold axis, each Fc molecule potentially may bind up to two FcgR molecules, as reported for interactions of Fc with its other ligands such as staphylococcal protein A (Deisenhofer, 1981; Kato et al., 1993), streptococcal protein G (Kato et al., 1995; Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995) and rat neonatal FcR (Huber et al., 1993; Burmeister et al., 1994). Using equilibrium gel ®ltration, Sondermann et al. (1999b) have shown that human IgG-Fc can bind one or two sFcgRII molecules and proposed a 1:2 stoichiometry model for the interaction between human IgG-Fc and membrane FcgRII. In contrast, hydrodynamic studies have demonstrated a stoichiometry of 1:1 (one IgG binding one FcgR) for the interaction between human IgG1-Fc and FcgRIII (Ghirlando et al., 1995) as well as that between human IgE-Fc and FceRI (highaf®nity receptor for the Fc portion of IgE) (Kanellopoulos et al., 1980; Keown et al., 1995, 1997). By making use of hybrid mouse IgG1-IgG2a and IgG2a-IgG2b antibodies, Koolwijk et al. (1989) have shown that only one of the two heavy chains is involved in the binding to human FcgRI. This result appears to be consistent with the 1:1 stoichiometry model. It has been suggested that steric hindrance could prevent two FcgR molecules from binding to one IgG molecule but this is not necessarily a widely accepted rationale (Ghirlando et al., 1995). An alternative explanation is that the binding of the ®rst receptor molecule induces a conformational change on the IgG molecule, rendering the second binding site inactive, as indicated by thermodynamic data for the interaction between IgG1 and FcgRIII (Ghirlando et al., 1995) and by negative ellipticity measurements for the interaction between IgE and FceRI (Sechi et al., 1996). However, no direct evidence has so far been reported to show that the conformational change is induced in the second FcgR-binding site of the IgG molecule.

Interaction between IgG and Fc Receptors

X-ray crystallography is a powerful method, potentially sorting out the above issues. However, it is not always easy to judge whether intermolecular interactions observed in crystals actually exist in solution, or they simply re¯ect crystal contacts, which sometimes cause non-physiological conformational alteration (Kato et al., 1993; Gouda et al., 1992). Therefore, detailed information concerning the IgG-FcgR interactions in solution has de®nitely to be pursued. Expression systems to produce high amounts of recombinant soluble FcgR corresponding to the two extracellular domains of FcgR have been successfully established in eukaryotic cell lines (Varin Á et al., 1989; Sautes et al., 1991, 1994; Teillaud et al., 1994), and opened up a way to perform detailed physicochemical analyses on the IgG-FcgR interactions. Here we report a study of the interaction in solution between the Fc fragment of mouse IgG2b and a mouse soluble FcgRII (sFcgRII) expressed in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. On the basis of the sedimentation and NMR data, we propose a model that excludes the spontaneous triggering of cellular responses by IgG molecules in the absence of crosslinking by multivalent antigens.

Results and Discussion
Stoichiometry of the interaction between sFcg RII and Fc g We have determined the binding stoichiometry of Fc with sFcgRII by a conventional sedimentation equilibrium technique with ultracentrifugation. For both Fc and sFcgRII solutions, it was observed that the apparent molecular mass does not depend upon the concentration of the protein solution. This result indicates that both Fc and sFcgRII are monodisperse under the solution conditions employed in the present study. The partial speci®c volumes 0.662 cm3/g and 0.685 cm3/g were obtained experimentally for Fc and sFcgRII, respectively. These results were used to determine the molecular mass of Fc and sFcgRII as 52,000 and 26,000, respectively. The molecular masses thus determined correspond to the monomeric state for the two proteins. The sedimentation equilibrium data of a mixture of Fc and sFcgRII were subjected to a non-linear least-squares ®tting using 1:1 and 1:2 interaction models (Ghirlando et al., 1995). The absorbance gradient at equilibrium of a mixture of Fc and sFcgRII is shown in Figure 1. A 1:1 model gave a better ®t and the residuals obtained were perfectly randomly distributed on the curve. The interaction between Fc and sFcgRII was further examined by a sedimentation velocity technique. The apparent sedimentation coef®cient distributions, g(s*), were computed from the sedimentation velocity data obtained for solutions of Fc and sFcgRII alone and also of their mixture, and the results are shown in Figure 2. The s values for

Figure 1. Sedimentation equilibrium data at 280 nm and the corresponding residuals (inset) for a mixed solution of Fc and sFcgRII. The result obtained with a 1:2 molar ratio of Fc and sFcgRII (15 mM and 30 mM) in 50 mM NaCl is shown. The line through the data represents the best ®t for the 1:1 association model.

Fc (4.1 S) and sFcgRII (2.5 S) indicate that both of these glycoproteins are monomeric under the conditions examined, in accordance with the sedimentation equilibrium experiments described above. As Figure 2 shows, the g(s*) versus s* curve observed for the mixture (Fc, 7 mM, sFcgRII, 14 mM) exhibits two peaks at 2.5 S and 4.9 S. Taking the results of the s values obtained for Fc and sFcgRII into consideration, the peak at 2.5 S can be assigned to sFcgRII, and that of 4.9 S to the Fc-sFcgRII complex. Fitting of the peak at 4.9 S gave a diffusion constant D of 4.63 Â 10À7 cm2 sÀ1. The s value was determined using the Svedberg equation, and was combined with the D value to estimate the molecular mass of the complex. The molecular mass of 80,500 thus obtained corresponds to the value of a 1:1 complex. Any other peak corresponding to a complex with a different stoichiometry was not detected in the g(s*) curve. On the basis of the sedimentation equilibrium and velocity data, we conclude that the stoichiometry of the interaction between Fc and sFcgRII is 1:1. The 1:1 stoichiometry was also con®rmed by a gel-®ltration experiment (data not shown). These results are consistent with those obtained by Ghirlando et al. (1995), who found a 1:1 stoichiometry for the interaction between human IgG1-Fc and sFcgRIII but not with the 1:2 stoichiometry model proposed by Sondermann et al. (1999a) for the interaction between human IgG-Fc and membrane FcgRII. The differences in the amino acid sequences and/or different glycosylation patterns of the soluble FcgRs used could account for these discrepancies. Binding constants of sFcgRII to Fc were then examined under various salt concentrations by the sedimentation equilibrium method. The dissociation constants determined from equilibrium sedimentation at NaCl concentrations of 50, 100

and 200 mM were 2.77 mM, 14.5 mM and 32.3 mM, respectively. A distinct dependence of the dissociation constant on the NaCl concentration indicates that formation of a complex between Fc and sFcgRII is primarily characterized by electrostatic interactions. This is quite consistent with the dissociation kinetics data obtained by ¯uorescence photobleaching recovery analysis of mouse IgG1 and mouse FcgRII reconstituted into planar membranes (Hsieh & Thompson, 1995). Spectral assignments We attempted to determine the binding site of Fc to sFcgRII by use of NMR spectroscopy. We have already reported assignments of carbonyl 13C resonances originating from Met (Kato et al., 1991a), Trp (Kato et al., 1991b), His and Tyr (Kato et al., 1993), residues of mouse IgG2b-Fc. In addition, we have newly assigned several carbonyl 13 C resonances originating from Ala, Arg, Cys, Ile, Leu, and Phe residues predominantly by use of the selective 13C and 15N double-labeling technique (Kainosho & Tsuji, 1982; Kato et al., 1989). An example of spectral assignments achieved by the double-labeling technique is shown in Figure 3, where the carbonyl region of the 13C NMR spectrum of the Fc fragment labeled solely with [1-13C]Ile is compared with that observed using the Fc fragment doubly labeled with both [1-13C]Ile and [a-15N]Arg. In the spectrum of the doubly labeled Fc fragment, the resonance at 172.8 ppm is split into a doublet, due to the existence of 1JCN. Therefore, this resonance was unambiguously assigned to Ile300, which is the only Ile residue that is directly followed by Arg in the peptide chain. Selective 15N-labeling of Asn, Asp, Gln, and Glu is not possible in the present protocol due to meta-

Interaction between IgG and Fc Receptors

Surprisingly, although 14 Leu residues exist in each heavy chain, 15 carbonyl resonances could be identi®ed (Figure 4(a)), thus suggesting that one Leu residue gives a double peak in the spectrum. Figure 4(b) shows the 13C NMR spectrum of another Fc analog labeled with [1-13C]Leu. This Fc analog was prepared by V8 protease digestion and lacks the hinge segment preceeding Gly236. Comparison of its spectrum with that of the entire Fc (Figure 4(a)) shows that it lacks the double peak observed at 176 ppm. Since Leu234 is the only Leu residue that is located in the removed hinge segment we therefore assign this double peak to Leu234. On the basis of this observation, we further suggest that the lower hinge portion neighboring Leu234 exhibits a conformational multiplicity in solution. The double peak might correspond to resonances from the Leu234 residue of both heavy chains, which take different conformation from each other rendering the molecular shape asymmetric. Another possibility is that each of the Leu234 residues can take different conformations. At the present stage, it is not possible to distinguish these possibilities. Assignment of the Ala231 resonance was also achieved by comparison of the spectrum of the Fc fragment with that of the hinge-deleted Fc. As shown in Figure 4(b), one peak is missing in the spectrum of the Fc analog prepared by V8 protease digestion. Since Ala231 is the only Ala residue that is located in the removed hinge segment, we therefore assign this peak to Ala231. Mapping of binding-site of Fc to sFcg RII g By making use of the carbonyl 13C resonances as spectroscopic probes, we extensively mapped sFcgRII-binding site on Fc on the basis of chemical shift perturbation data collected upon complex formation. Figure 5 shows the 13C NMR spectra of [1-13C]Leu-labeled Fc complexed in the presence of increasing amounts of sFcgRII. Upon addition of 0.5 molar equivalent of sFcgRII (to Fc), the resonance originating from Leu234 decreased in intensity. In the presence of one molar equivalent of sFcgRII it totally disappeared from its original position (176 ppm) and concomitantly reappeared at new positions in the spectrum (175.6 ppm and 175.0 ppm). When the Fc labeled with [1-13C]Ile was used, a selective perturbation of Ile300 was observed upon addition of sFcgRII (Figure 6(a)). In contrast, no signi®cant chemical shift change was observed for the Phe resonances (Figure 6(b)). Similar experiments were performed monitoring the Ala, Arg, Cys, His, Met, Trp, and Tyr residues. None of these residues exhibited signi®cant chemical shift changes (>0.1 ppm), with the exception of Ala231 (Figure 6(c)) and Tyr296 (Figure 6(d)), which showed 0.13 ppm down-®eld and 0.25 ppm up-®eld, respectively, upon addition of sFcgRII. In accordance with these results, it has been observed that one leucine residue is perturbed upon binding

bolic isotope scrambling (Kato et al., 1991a). Therefore the double-labeling technique was not applicable to assignments of the carbonyl resonances originating from residues that are directly followed by one of these four of amino acid residues. In such cases, other techniques including a combined use of selective proteolytic digestion had to be employed. Figure 4(a) shows the 13C NMR spectrum of the Fc fragment labeled with [1-13C]Leu.

The proteins were dissolved in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), containing 200 mM NaCl and 3 mM NaN3 in 90 % 1H2O/ 10 % 2H2O. The arrow indicates the resonance originating from Ile300. It should be noted that the peaks at 174.8, 174.0, 173.3, and 169.9 ppm are superpositions of two, three, two, and two resonances, respectively.

to sFcgRII of a hinge peptide from human IgG1, using one-dimensional 1H NMR analysis (Hindley et al., 1993). The residues perturbed and not perturbed upon addition of sFcgRII were then mapped on the crystal structure of the Fc portion of IgG. As shown in Figure 7, the residues that have shown a chemical shift change more than 0.1 ppm (Ala231, Leu234, Tyr296, and Ile300) form a continuous area in the lower hinge region and its spatial proximity in the CH2 domain. On the basis of these data, we conclude that this area is responsible for the binding to sFcgRII. Calculation of surface electrostatic potential of Fc indicates that the sFcgRII-binding site thus identi®ed is negatively charged (Figure 8). Considering the fact that the formation of a complex between Fc and sFcgRII is primarily characterized by electrostatic interactions (vide supra), we suggest that some positively charged area on the sFcgRII surface is responsible for the binding to the negatively charged hinge proximal region of Fc. Goldsmith

et al. (1997) have reported that synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 108-119 and 153-165 (BC and FG loops of the second domain of sFcgRII, respectively) have the ability to inhibit the binding of the immune-complex to immobilized sFcgRII. Since these peptides are abundant in basic amino acid residues, it has been suggested that the FcgRII binds to Fc through predominantly electrostatic forces. The analysis of the crystal structure of human FcgRII, together with mutagenesis studies, have identi®ed several amino acid residues of the BC (residues 116-119), CH E (residues 133-137) and FG (residues 157-163) loop regions of the second domain of human FcgRII as putative contact residues (Maxwell et al., 1999). It is of interest that mouse FcgRII contains several basic amino acid residues in this region (Lys116, His133, His134 and Arg160). Altogether, these data lead us to conclude that Fc binds to sFcgRII through electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged hinge proximal region of Fc and the positively charged BC, CH E and FG loops of the second domain of sFcgRII.

The Fc fragment prepared by V8 protease digestion lacks the hinge segment preceeding Gly236. The proteins were dissolved in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), containing 200 mM NaCl and 3 mM NaN3 in 90 % 1H2O/10 % 2H2O. The arrows in (a) and (b) indicate the double peak originating from Leu234 and the peak originating from Ala231.

Mutagenesis studies indicate that the lower hinge region is involved in the interaction of a variety of FcgR. Lund et al. (1992) have found that an amino acid substitution of either Gly237, Asn297, or Glu318 to Ala results in an inability of IgG to interact with mouse FcgRII. The fact that Gly237 and Asn297 are located within the sFcgRII -binding site is consistent with the present data. The loss of af®nity occuring upon mutation of Asn297 might indeed be due to the lack of the carbohydrate chains (Lund et al., 1992). By comparative 1H NMR analyses of aglycosylated and glycosylated Fc fragments of human IgG1 and IgG3, it has been shown that removal of the carbohydrate chains induces a local structural change around His268, which is located in spatial proximity of the lower hinge region of these Fc fragments (Matsuda et al., 1990; Lund et al., 1990). Glu318 is, however, spatially separated from the lower hinge region, and we found no evidence for perturbation around Glu318 upon the binding to sFcgRII. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the mutation has caused a subtle conformational change in the lower hinge and/or its

proximal regions. However, it has been reported, on the basis of one-dimensional 1H NMR data, that no drastic conformational change was induced upon the mutation (Lund et al., 1992). Another possibility is that Glu318 contributes to the interaction by electrostatic guidance of sFcgRII in the association phase, but is not directly involved in the binding site. Conformational change of Fc upon binding to sFcg RII g The progressive change in intensity of the Leu234 resonance upon addition of sFcgRII (Figure 5) indicates that exchange between free and sFcgRII-bound Fc is slow in the NMR timescale. The observation that the Leu234 resonance completely disappears from its original position and reappears at two other positions in the spectrum when one molar equivalent (to Fc) of sFcgRII is added demonstrates that the binding of one sFcgRII molecule induces microenvironmental changes in the lower hinge region of both heavy chains yet probably in a different fashion. Since the

stoichiometry of the interaction is 1:1 the most likely interpretation of this result is that the binding of one sFcgRII molecule onto one of the two symmetrically related sites of Fc, induces a conformational change in the other site. We suggest that this conformational change precludes the binding of the second sFcgRII molecule to Fc.

It is established that crosslinking of FcgR membrane molecules is the ®rst step in the FcgRmediated activation of cells (Metzger, 1978). If the stoichiometry of the IgG- sFcgRII would have been 1:2, one IgG molecule could crosslink two sFcgRII molecules and this could trigger undesired cellular responses even in the absence of a multivalent anti-

Replacements of the side-chains were achieved by use of the program TurboFrodo, version 5.4. The surface electrostatic potentials were calculated and represented by use of the program Molmol 2.5.1. Except for His429, all other His residues were built-in as the deprotonation form on the basis of the pKa data obtained by the previous NMR analysis (Kato et al., 1993). The model is shown in the same orientation as in Figure 7. Red, negative; blue, positive.

gen. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the distribution of FcgRII on the cell surface and the topology of its interaction with IgG imped such a crosslinking, the 1:1 stoichiometry is physiologically the most advantageous one. We therefore suggest that the conformational regulation described here prevents spontaneous crosslinking of two sFcgRII molecules by one IgG molecule in the absence of multivalent antigens.

hinge segment preceding Gly236 was prepared by a V8 protease treatment as described (Yamaguchi et al., 1995). Analytical ultracentrifugation In the case of the Fc and sFcgRII glycoproteins, determination of the molecular masses in solution using ultracentrifuge techniques requires that accurate partial speci®c volumes are provided. Therefore, the partial speci®c volumes of these proteins were determined experimentally from density measurements (Durchschlag, 1986). Density measurements of both Fc and sFcgRII in aqueous solution, at various solute concentrations, were carried out at 25  C using a DMA5000 density meter (Anton-Paar, Austria). The average values of three measurements for each solution were used. Analytical ultracentrifugal experiments were performed using an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Inc.) equipped with An-60 Ti titanium four hole rotor with a double-sectored charcoal ®lled epon centerpiece of either a 3 mm or 12 mm path length. The path length of the centerpiece was selected according to the concentration of the solution being studied. All solutions for ultracentrifuge study were dialyzed against the solvent used in a dialysis cup with a molecular mass cutoff of 12,000. At the beginning of the sedimentation equilibrium study, the molecular mass of Fc and sFcgRII in solution were examined individually. Samples of either Fc or sFcgRII were prepared in 5 mM sodium phosphate

Methods
Preparation of sFcg RII g Recombinant sFcgRII corresponding to the 174 Nterminal amino acid residues of mouse FcgRII (Varin et al., 1989) was expressed in BHK cells and puri®ed by ion exchange and af®nity chromatography, from culture medium of 6/9CII cell line grown on hollow ®bers Á (Sautes et al., 1994; Teillaud et al., 1994). Preparation of Fc The mouse cell line 7D7, which produces anti-progesterone IgG2b (k) (Sawada et al., 1987), was generously provided by Dr T. Terao and Dr J. Sawada. Isotopically normal and labeled Fc fragments of mouse IgG2b were prepared by the papain digestion as described (Kato et al., 1989, 1991a,b). The Fc fragment that lacks the

(pH 7.3), with 200 mM NaCl. Runs were carried out at 12,000 rpm and at 25  C and concentration gradients were acquired every six hours at 280 nm or at 257 nm to test for equilibrium. The concentration gradient was judged to be at equilibrium when the successive gradients could be completely superimposed. Then the sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares ®tting of data using the program Microcal Origin, ver 3.78, on a PC-AT compatible computer. The solution mixture of Fc and sFcgRII was centrifuged to study their interaction. Protein concentrations varied from 5 to 50 mM in the solutions of 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), with 200 mM NaCl. Samples prepared with 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratio mixtures of Fc and sFcgRII were examined. The concentration of NaCl varied between 50 and 200 mM for the protein mixture with a solution concentration of 14 mM. Forty-eight hours after the beginning of the run, the concentration gradient reached equilibrium and was analyzed as described in the literature (Ghirlando et al., 1995). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed for Fc (7 mM), sFcgRII (14 mM) and their mixtures at pH 7.3 and at 25  C in a solution of 5 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM NaCl. For the mixtures both of a 1:1 and a 1:2 molar ratio of Fc and sFcgRII were used. Sample volumes of 400 ml were centrifuged at 60,000 rpm, and radial scans of absorbance were recorded every ®ve minutes. Analysis of the velocity data for deducing the sedimentation coef®cient distributions from the time derivative of the absorbance pro®les was conducted with DCDT (F.W. Stafford, BBRI, Harvard University) on a Power Mac 8100/100 Macintosh computer. The values of the sedimentation coef®cients, s, and diffusion constants, D, were estimated as described by Stafford (1992).

Gel-filtration Gel-®ltration was performed to determine the stoichiometry of the Fc-sFcgRII interaction. Fc and sFcgRII were mixed in various proportions and then loaded onto a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), containing 200 mM NaCl and 3 mM NaN3. The complex and free sFcgRII were quantitated spectrometrically at 280 nm.

NMR measurements The Fc solutions were concentrated to a ®nal volume of 1.8 ml in 5 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.3), in 90 % H2O/ 10 % 2H2O unless otherwise stated. A 10 mm NMR sample tube was used with a ®nal Fc concentration of 70 mM. 13C NMR measurements were made on a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer at 100 MHz. The probe temperature was 30  C. All spectra were recorded with the use of a WALTZ-16 composite pulse for 1H decoupling. The free induction decay after a 30  pulse was recorded with a repetition period of one second, with 32,768 data points and spectral width of 24,000 Hz, or with 8192 data points and spectral width of 1500 Hz. All free induction decays were multiplied by a Gaussian window function prior to Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were given in parts per million (ppm) from internal dioxane.
