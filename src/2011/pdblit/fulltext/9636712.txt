D o u g l a s W. M o r g a n , C e l i a M. A n d e r s o n a n d K e n n e t h P. M e y e r s Bronchopulmonary Research, Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc., Nutley, NJ 07110, USA Received 20 January 1993, accepted 26 January 1993

The rat paw edema-inducing, acute inflammatory activity of four snake venom phospholipase Azs (PLA z) (Naja naja, Naja mocambique mocambique, Crotalus atrox and recombinant Naja naja naja) and of recombinant human type II PLA 2 (rh-PLA 2) found in rheumatoid synovial fluid, were compared after a bolus subplantar injection. The snake venom-derived PLA2s , including the recombinant Naja naja naja, were potent inducers of paw cdema. On the other hand, when given in similar amounts (protein and/or enzymatic activity), the rh-PLA z did not produce paw edema. Furthermore, the addition of Naja naja PLA 2, blood plasma from rats with adjuvant arthritis or the E. coli-based enzymatic incubation mixture used to measure PLA z activity to the injection mixture containing rh-PLAz, did not result in paw edema-inducing activity. These results suggest that the lack of paw edema-inducing activity of rh-PLA 2 may be due to significant structural differences between snake venom PLAzs and human PLA 2 which allow snake venom PLA2s , but not the human group II PLA2, to express inflammatory activity as measured by paw edema in rat induced by a bolus injection.

1. Introduction The phospholipases A 2 (PLA2s) are an important group of enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl ester of phospholipids producing fatty acids and lysophospholipids (Waite, 1987). Arachidonic acid, commonly found esterified at the sn-2 position, is released by P L A 2 and serves as the substrate for the ultimate generation of eicosanoids, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and platelet activating factor, lipid mediators of inflammation (Needleman et al., 1986; Dennis, 1990). P L A 2 is thought to be the regulating enzyme for generation of the eicosanoids (Dennis, 1987). Lysophospholipids have powerful m e m b r a n e lytic and suro factant effects (Stafford and Dennis, 1988) and serve as substrates for the biosynthesis of platelet activating factor and other phospholipids (Hanahan, 1986; Lin° dahl et al., 1988). Since it is well known that the products of P L A 2 action, arachidonic acid together with its metabolites and lysophospholipids, have profound inflammatory actions (Samuelsson, 1987; Zipser

and Giacomo, 1985), it is reasonable to hypothesize that specific inhibitors of PLA2s might be useful for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (Chang et al., 1987). In recent years, a considerable effort has been directed at developing PLA 2 inhibitors into antiinflammatory therapeutics (Mobilio and Marshall, 1989). A variety of enzymatic and in vivo assays systems have been established to identify PLA 2 inhibitors with anti inflammatory activity. A family of low molecular weight (14 kDa) PLA2s , found abundantly in nature, have been studied and utilized extensively (Mobilio and Marshall, 1989) for inhibitor development. As a family of proteins, the 14 kDa PLA2s are highly conserved structurally (Davidson and Dennis, 1990), easily purified from several sources and quite stable. They have been classified into several subgroups (Davidson and Dennis, 1990): human group I enzymes are of pancreatic origin while those of group II are found not only in snake venom but also in mammalian systems. G r o u p II PLA2s are secreted from inflammatory cells (Vadas and Pruzanski, 1986) and are found in a variety of inflammatory tissues including skin from psoriatic patients (Forster et al., 1985), arthritic synovial fluid (Vadas et al., 1985) and in plasma from septic shock patients (Vadas et al., 1988). Thus, the mammalian

46 group II PLA2s have become known as inflammatory PLA2s; however, exactly how they contribute to inflammation is not known, Until recently, purification of the group II PLA2s from inflamed mammalian tissues and fluids had been difficult; therefore, these PLA2s were not available in the quantities needed to investigate adequately structure, enzymatic properties and in vivo activities. Consequently, most knowledge of the biological activities, structures, and enzyme kinetic mechanism(s) of inflammatory PLA2s has come from studies of snake venom PLAzs. Furthermore, because snake venoms and the PLA2s purified from them induce several pathophysiological effects (Rothschild and Rothschild, 1979), including edema formation when injected subcutaneously or intraarticularly into laboratory animals (Vishwanath et al., 1988; Wang and Teng, 1990; Cirino et al., 1989; Chang et al., 1989; Calhoun et al., 1989; Chiu et al., 1989), in vivo models of inflammation utilizing group I and group II snake venom enzymes have come into routine use to assess the antiinflammatory activity of PLA 2 inhibitors. Unfortunately, similar models using mammalian group II PLAzs have not been as well developed, although human synovial group II PLA 2 was reported to induce rat paw edema (Vishwanath et al., 1988). The recent development of cloning and purification procedures for a 14 kDa PLA 2 found in human arthritic synovial fluid and in platelets (Crowl et al., 1990; Levin et al., 1992; Kramer et al., 1989) has made it possible to obtain quantities of a recombinant human PLA2 type II (rh-PLA 2) sufficient to evaluate its activity in in vivo systems. In this study, we compared the edemaproducing activity of rh-PLA~ and snake venom PLA2s to evaluate the potential for developing models of inflammation using human inflammatory PLA~s. (rh-PLA 2) was prepared at Hoffmann LaRoche Inc., Nutley, NJ (Crowl et al., 1990; Levin et al., 1992). Pure native and recombinant Naja naja naja PLA2s were kindly supplied by Michael Kelley and Edward Dennis, Department of Chemistry and Center for Molecular Genetics of the University of California at La Jolla, CA (Kelly et al. 1992). Human synovial fluid (HSF) was obtained from knee joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients by Dr I. Jaffe (Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, New York City, NY).

2.2. InactiL,ation of Naja naja PLA 2 with p-bromophenacylbromide Naja naja PLA 2 (0.8 m g / m l in 0.9% NaCI was irreversibly inactivated with 100 p.M para-bromophenacylbromide (PBPB, :Sigma Chemical Co.) by incubating for 22 h at 37°C. The excess PBPB was removed by extensive dialysis against 0.15 M NaCI at 4°C. 2.3. Phospholipase A 2 enzymatic assay
PLA 2 activity was measured as described by Vadas et al. (1986). Reaction mixtures (500/xl) contained 109, [~4C] oleate-labeled, heat-inactivated E. coli membranes (10000 dpm 14C), 5 mM CaC12, 125 mM NaC1, 50 mM sodium (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2ethanesulfonate]) (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.3), 3.3 mg bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO; fatty acid free) and enzyme. Enzyme protein was adjusted to maintain a linear reaction rate (less than 15-18% hydrolysis of the substrate) when incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml 50 mM E D T A and the entire reaction mixture was filtered through 0.45 p~m filters to separate the E. coli from released oleic acid. The filtrate was added to 15 ml of Aquasol (New England Nuclear Corp., Boston, MA) and radioactivity quantitated with liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. A unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 p~mol of oleate released/rain and the specific enzyme activity as mol of oleate r e l e a s e d / m i n per mg enzyme protein. Protein concentrations were measured by the procedure of Lowry et al. (1951).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sources of PLA 2 enzymes
PLA2 purified from Naja naja (P-6139), Naja mocambique mocambique (P-7778) and Crotalus atrox (P3770) snake venoms were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO. The Naja naja and Naja mocambique mocambique PLA2s were used without further purification; however the Crotulas atrox PLA 2 was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-ToyoPearl (Tosohaas Inc., Philadelphia, PA) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.0). The PLA2 was eluted with a NaC1 gradient (0-3 M) in elution buffer. Fractions containing PLA2 activity which migrated as a single band by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were combined and used in these studies. Pure recombinant human type II PLA 2

2.4. PLA2-induced paw edema
Male Lewis rats (250-300 g) were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. Paw swelling was induced by a single subplantar injection of PLA2 in 0.1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into the right hind paw using a 1.0 ml plastic syringe fitted with a 25 gauge needle. The volume of the injected paw of each rat was measured by water displacement with a plethysmometer (Stoeling Co., Wood Dale, IL, model No. 7150) immediately before

47

(initial volume, V~), and then at different times after injection (Vt) of P L A 2. Paw swelling was calculated as the difference between the Vt and V i and is expressed as the mean paw swelling per group of six animals standard deviation (S.D.). Statistically significant differences between the initial and resultant volumes (Vt) were determined using Student's t-test. Differences between groups and times were determined by analysis of variance ( A N O V A ) followed by a post hoc test of significance using the Student-Newman-Keuls procedure; both were run using the SAS Statistical Program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

2.5. Adju~,ant-induced arthritis
Adjuvant (0.1 mg Mycobacterium butyricum in 0.1 ml mineral oil) was injected into the base of the tail of male Lewis rats (120-140 g) and the resulting arthritis was allowed to develop for 15 days. Blood was collected in heparin anticoagulant (0.2 units/100/xl); this concentration of heparin was not inhibitory to PLA 2 activity.

3. Results In table 1 are shown the time-courses of the changes in rat paw volumes (edemas) induced by subplantar injection of various PLA2s and their vehicles, saline and PBS (controls). C o m p a r e d with the uninjected paw volume, injection of saline (100 /.tl) resulted in a transient increase in paw volume which was significant only at 0.5 h (0.14 +_ 0.05 ml). Since this effect was not significant at 2, 4 and 6 h, the increase at 0.5 h may have resulted only from the volume of vehicle injected;

therefore, comparisons among other experimental observations at 2, 4 or 6 h were made to eliminate the possible injection artifact occurring at 0.5 h. Subplantar injection of group I snake venom PLA2s from Naja naja and Naja naja naja resulted in signifio cant and similar increases in paw volumes which persisted throughout the 6-h measurement time compared with controls (table 1). Recombinant Naja naja naja PLA 2 also exhibited a similar level of edemagenic activity. Injection of 0.40 units (5.3 /zg protein) Naja naja PLA 2 produced a significant increase in paw volume at every m e a s u r e m e n t time (e.g., 0.6 ml at 2 h). Injection of 7.7 /xg protein PBPB-treated Naja naja PLA 2 did not induce an edema response. Since the treatment of Naja naja PLA 2 with PBPB effectively inhibited the enzymatic activity by greater than 99.9%, this indicated that the edema produced was probably due to the enzymatic activity of Naja naja PLA 2. A third group I PLA 2 from Naja mocambique mocambique induced considerable paw edema, in agreement with the fact that the specific activity of this enzyme ( u n i t s / m g protein) was higher than the specific activity of the other group I PLA2s. Injection of 1.8 units Crotalus atrox (14/zg protein), a group II snake venom PLA2, induced an edema response which was less than that seen with 1.9 units of Naja mocambique rnocambique PLA2 increased paw volumes. Injection of 0.58 units (12 /.tg protein) rhPLA 2 did not result in any increase in paw volume. To investigate whether rh-PLA 2 may be edemagenic in the presence of factors not required by snake venom-derived PLA2, assay conditions were modified as listed in table 2. In Experiment A, premixing 0.29 units (6.0 /,tg protein) of rh-PLA2 with a submaximal edema-producing amount of Naja naja PLA 2 (0.08

naja naja P L A 2 suggests that no cofactors are necessary for the e d e m a response. Because r h - P L A 2 a n d r e c o m b i n a n t Naja naja naja P L A z were p r o d u c e d by the similar t e c h n i q u e s (Kelly et al., 1992; Growl et al., 1990), the r e c o m b i n a n t technology a n d p u r i f i c a t i o n p r o c e d u r e s did not alter the r e c o m b i n a n t proteins. T h e results of this study suggest that p e r h a p s the structural differences, r a t h e r t h a n missing activating factors, b e t w e e n h u m a n 14kDa P L A 2 a n d snake v e n o m derived P L A 2 s may a c c o u n t for the lack of e d e m a - p r o d u c i n g activity observed with r h - P L A 2. F u r t h e r m o r e , the p h o s p h o l i p i d s in rat paw tissue may not be a p r e f e r r e d substrate of r h - P L A 2. O n e may also pose a teleological a r g u m e n t that snake v e n o m P L A 2 s were d e s i g n e d to p r o d u c e e d e m a a n d to increase p e r f u s i o n of the affected area to e n h a n c e the spread of the v e n o m . S n a k e v e n o m P L A 2 s are k n o w n to have a n u m b e r of systemic effects, e.g., neurotoxic, anticoagulant a n d myotoxic activities ( D a v i d s o n a n d D e n n i s , 1991). O n the o t h e r h a n d , the e n d o g e n o u s m a m m a l i a n P L A : , which is f o u n d a b u n d a n t l y in plasma, must be u n d e r tight r e g u l a t i o n and, therefore, may not display extensive hydrolytic activity unless activated by a specific set of conditions. T h e s e e n d o g e n o u s secreted P L A 2 s may act as acute phase p r o t e i n s (Growl et al., 1991) or may even limit the c o a g u l a t i o n process w h e n this process is initiated at the site of an infection or injury. Based o n the results of this study, a n a n i m a l m o d e l in rat of acute P L A 2 - i n d u c e d paw e d e m a does not a p p e a r possible using purified p r e p a r a t i o n s of h u m a n g r o u p II P L A 2 as have b e e n developed using s n a k e v e n o m derived g r o u p I a n d II PLA2s.
