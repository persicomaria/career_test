13C' NMR Spectra. The data for thiamine were in agreement with the coordination at the N-l' nitrogen since significant downfield chemical shifts are exhibited by carbon atoms near to the pyrimidine N-l' donor (C-6', C-2' and 2'-CHs). The present data strongly support the binding of dioxouranium(V1) to thiamine at the pyrimidine N-l' site. The major bonding site of cocarboxylase to uranyl(V1) seems to be the pyrophosphate group even if a possible involvement of the N-l' donor should be considered.

d(T-G-G-C-C-A), d(A-T-G-G) and d(C-C-A-T-G-G) oligonucleotides give GG-platinum chelates. We have studied the stoichiometric reactions between cis-[Pt(NH,),(H,0)2](NOs)2 and the deoxyoligonucleotides d(T-G-G-C-C-A), d(A-T-G-G) and d(C-C-A-T-G-G) (1 Pt per oligonucleotide) in the 10-5-10-4 M concentration range, in water at 37 "C. In the reaction conditions `H NMR shows that the self complementary hexanucleotides are essentially in the single strand form. For the three reactions, HPLC and `H NMR analyses show that the oligonucleotide is completely converted to a single complex. The same complex is obtained from the reaction with cis-DDP. High pressure gel permeation chromatography and atomic absorption spectroscopy coupled with the UV absorption of the complex, show that one platinum atom is bound per oligonucleotide. `H NMR (400 and 500 MHz) of the two hexanucleotide complexes (1-5 X 10e3 M) shows that they are single stranded in conditions where the free selfcomplementary oligonucleotides adopt a duplex structure [ 14, 1.51. The metal binding sites in the d(T-G-G-C-C-A)[Pt] , d(A-T-G-G)[Pt] and d(C-C-A-T-G-G)[Pt] complexes have been determined by the analysis of the pH dependence of the chemical shifts of the non exchangeable base protons. In the three cases, on going from basic to acidic pH, one observes the successive protonations of the thymine N3 (apparent pK, cu lo), of the Nl of the two guanines (app. pK, e 8.38.5 instead of ca 10 for the free oligonucleotides), of the N3 of the two cytosines (app. pK, = 4.1-4.5) and of the adenine Nl (app. pK, = 3.4-3.5). These data, together with the two different GH8 downfield shifts already encountered for the d(G-G)[Pt] and d(C-C-G-G)[Pt] chelates [lo, 111, show that the cisPtn(NH3)2 moiety is chelated by the N7 atoms of the adjacent guanines. T1 relaxation times of the base protons, nuclear Overhauser enhancements between the GH8 and deoxy-ribose H2' and H3', allowed the assignment of the external and internal guanines and together with two dimensional NMR (J-6) allowed the identification of the C3'-endu deoxy-ribose that is characteristic of the diguanosine chelates [ 10, 161.

It is generally accepted that, within the cell, DNA is the primary target of the active aquated forms of the antitumor cis-[Pt(NHJ)zC1z] drug (cis-DDP) [l, 21. The fact that only the cis isomer of the complex exhibits antineoplastic activity, suggests that the cytotoxic lesion could result from a particular bifunctional coordination of the cis-Ptn(NHS)z moiety [ 11. Intrastrand cross-linking is one possibility [3] and platinum chelation by two adjacent guanines has received much support from studies with various DNAs [4-81 and oligonucleotide models [9-141. We report here that the three

Recently much attention has been paid to palladium-containing complexes, due to their potent anti-tumor activities [3-71. We report here the synthesis and characterisation of Pd(I1) complexes with xanthine (XH), theophylline (TH), theobromine (TBH), 3 JLdimethylxanthine (DMH), caffeine (C) and 1,3&trimethylxanthine (TMH).

The chemicals theophylline, theobromine, caffeine and PdClz were purchased from Carlo Erba; and were used without further purification. 3,8-dimethylxanthine and 1,3,8_trimethylxanthine were synthesized in our laboratory [S, 91. The Pd(I1) complexes of these ligands were prepared in acid media (HCl 0.25 N), mixing solutions of the ligands and metal salt, PdCl, (2:l mole ratio). Tetrachloro palladates were obtained from solutions with ligand: cation relation equal to 1 :l in acid media (HCl 2.5 N). The precipitates formed in each case were washed with distilled water, ethanol and ether and then air-dried. The IR spectra were run on Beckman 4250. `H NMR studies were performed in DMSO-d6 on Hitachi Perkin Elmer R-600 high resolution NMR spectrometer. TMS was used as internal reference.
