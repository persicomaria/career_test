Keywords: glucagon-like peptide-1 dipeptidyl peptidase-4 type 2 diabetes sitagliptin vildagliptin treatment

Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a novel oral treatment for type 2 diabetes. DPP-4 inhibition increases insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion by preventing the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), thereby lowering glucose levels. Several DPP-4 inhibitors are in clinical development; more studies exist for sitagliptin and vildagliptin. They improve metabolic control in type 2 diabetes in monotherapy and also in combination with metformin, sulphonylurea and thiazolidinediones. HbA1c is reduced by approximately 0.6­1.1% in studies up to 52 weeks. Similar, although more limited, results were obtained for saxagliptin. DPP-4 inhibitors are safe and tolerable with no increased risk of adverse events compared to placebo and have a low risk of hypoglycaemia. DPP-4 inhibitors are body weight-neutral. The DPP-4 inhibitors are recommended for use in the early stage of type 2 diabetes, in combination with metformin in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control. DPP-4 inhibition may also be used in combination with sulphonylurea and thiazolidinediones and potentially also in combination with insulin. The durability and long-term safety of DPP-4 inhibitiors remain to be established. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

rapid inactivation of the two main incretin hormones: glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)4, which stimulate insulin secretion with glucose.4,5 GLP-1 also inhibits glucagon secretion6 and, as shown in rodents, increases islet cell neogenesis and reduces beta-cell apoptosis.7 It also induces satiety4 and may improve myocardial8 and endothelial function.9 Since the early 1990s, GLP-1 has been explored as a novel strategy for the treatment of diabetes.5 Its rapid inactivation by DPP-4 limits the use of native GLP-1 and to overcome this problem, DPP-4-resistant GLP-1 receptor agonists and inhibitors of DPP-4 have been developed.10­13 DPP-4 and DPP-4 inhibitors DPP-4 is expressed in several organs and also exists in a soluble, circulating form.14 The enzyme cleaves the N-terminal dipeptide from oligopeptides with preferential action when the second amino acid is alanin (as in GLP-1 and GIP) or proline. DPP-4 is efficient and the half-life of active GLP-1 is less than 2 min.5 Several DPP-4 inhibitors exist11,12 such as vildagliptin (LAF237; GalvusR, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), sitagliptin (MK-0431; JanuviaR, Merck, Whitehouse Station, N.J., USA) and saxagliptin (BMS-477118, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, N.Y., USA/Astra Zeneca, London, UK) that competitively and reversibly inhibit DPP-4 .1­3 They are orally active and rapidly absorbed; Cmax is observed within 1­2 h and bioavailability exceeds 80% after oral intake. Vildagliptin is, to a large degree, metabolised by hydrolysis to an inactive compound which is excreted in the urine; only approximately 20% of vildagliptin is excreted unchanged. In contrast, sitagliptin is primarily excreted as unchanged drug by the kidneys and, therefore, renal insufficiency increases circulating levels of sitagliptin.15 Saxagliptin is metabolised in the liver to an active compound and both saxagliptin and the metabolite are renally excreted. Hepatic insufficiency does not seem to alter the pharmacokinetics of these compounds. No drug interactions have been observed for the DPP-4 inhibitors with other drugs. Mechanisms of the improvement of glycaemia by DPP-4 inhibitors A major mechanism underlying the anti-diabetic action of the DPP-4 inhibitors is increased concentrations of active GLP-1 and GIP, as has been demonstrated, both following meal ingestion16 and during the entire 24 h pattern.17 This results in improved beta-cell function, as demonstrated by increased insulin secretion17,18 and reduced pro-insulin-to-insulin ratio.19,20 DPP-4 inhibition also reduces glucagon secretion16,17, which corresponds to inhibition of hepatic glucose production.21 Both fasting and prandial glucose levels are reduced after DPP-4 inhibition; the 24 h glucose profile is typically reduced by approximately 1 mmol lÀ1.22,23 Rodent studies have shown that vildagliptin and sitagliptin increase islet mass and normalise isletcell topography in diabetes models.24,25It should be emphasised, however, that no evidence of increased beta-cell mass exists in human studies. It is of interest that, as shown for vildagliptin, DPP-4 inhibition increases insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes, as determined by both, an indirect estimate of insulin sensitivity18 and the hyperinsulinemic, euglycaemic clamp test.26 This may be a consequence of the reduced glucagon levels seen after DPP-4 inhibition in association with improved insulin action due to improved metabolic control. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition has the potential of improving glycaemic control through a number of different actions, the most important being improved islet function. DPP-4 inhibition (1) increases fasting and prandial GLP-1 levels; (2) reduces fasting and prandial glucose; (3) improves islet beta- and alpha-cell function in type 2 diabetes; (4) increases beta-cell mass, as demonstrated in rodents; and (5) increases insulin sensitivity. Glycaemic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors as monotherapy Comparisons with placebo The clinical proof of concept study showed that DPP-4 inhibition by NVP DPP728 (Novartis) improves glycaemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes.22 The first clinical study with vildagliptin

¨ examined a daily administration (100 mg, n ¼ 18) versus placebo (n ¼ 19) to drug-naive patients (mean baseline HbA1c 7.2%).16 When adjusted for changes after placebo, vildagliptin reduced mean HbA1c by 0.38% after 4 weeks. A subsequent 12-week study examined vildagliptin as monotherapy in patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.7%.27 Vildagliptin reduced HbA1c by 0.46% at 50 mg and 0.4% at 100 mg daily, compared to the non-significant 0.13% reduction by placebo. In a third study, vildagliptin at 25 mg twice daily for 12 weeks (mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%) reduced HbA1c levels by 0.6%.28 Another ¨ study examined vildagliptin as a single dose versus two daily divided doses for 24 weeks in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes with a baseline HbA1c of 8.4%.29 HbA1c was reduced by 0.7% by vildagliptin at 50 mg twice daily and 0.9% at 100 mg once daily. A large study (n ¼ 632) examined monotherapy with vildagliptin (50 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily) versus placebo for 24 weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes with a baseline HbA1c of 8.4%.30 HbA1c was reduced by 0.8­0.9% in the three groups given vildagliptin versus a reduction by 0.3% in the placebo group. Vildagliptin has also been examined when used in monotherapy (50 mg once daily) for 52 weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes with mild hyperglycaemia (HbA1c 6.2­7.2%).31 When adjusted for placebo, vildagliptin reduced HbA1c by 0.3%. The study was followed by a 52-week extension period in 131 patients. Following the 2-year period in these patients, HbA1c was reduced by 0.5% by the use of vildagliptin. Finally, in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), treated for 12 weeks with vildagliptin at 50 mg once daily (n ¼ 90) versus placebo (n ¼ 89), vildagliptin improved glycaemia as was evident by the reduced prandial glycaemia following a test meal.32 ¨ Sitagliptin (100 mg daily) was initially evaluated as monotherapy in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes using different doses for duration of 12 weeks. In one study (n ¼ 555; mean baseline HbA1c 7.7%), HbA1c was reduced by 0.56% by sitagliptin.33 A second study (n ¼ 743) examined sitagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.8%. It was found to have reduced HbA1c over 12 weeks by 0.8%.34 Furthermore, an 18-week study comprising 521 patients used sitagliptin at 100 mg or 200 mg once daily and with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.1%, it reduced HbA1c by 0.60% and 0.48%, respectively.19 Finally, a 24-week study using sitagliptin at 100 or 200 mg daily in ¨ drug-naive patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0% (n ¼ 741) showed a reduction by 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively.35 In the 18- and 24-week studies (n ¼ 1262), the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% was approximately 40% after treatment with sitagliptin at 100 mg versus only 16% in the placebo group. The first study on the clinical effect of saxagliptin examined the compound in monotherapy at doses ¨ of 2.5, 5, 10, 20 or 40 mg once daily versus placebo for 12 weeks in drug-naive patients (n ¼ 338) with baseline HbA1c of 7.9%.36 When adjusted for the placebo group, saxagliptin reduced HbA1c by 0.45­ 0.63%. Furthermore, a 6-week study using saxagliptin at a higher dose of 100 mg once daily (n ¼ 85) also showed significant reduction in HbA1c by 0.73% when adjusted for placebo.36 A subsequent study ¨ examined the influence of saxagliptin at different doses for 24 weeks in drug-naive patients (n ¼ 401). The placebo-adjusted reduction in HbA1c by saxagliptin was 0.62% at 2.5 mg daily, 0.64% at 5 mg daily and 0.73% at 10 mg daily.37 These studies thus show good and clinically important efficacy by the DPP-4 inhibitors in improving the glycaemic control as monotherapy. The reduction in HbA1c in studies lasting 12 weeks or more is 0.65­1.1%, and the effect on HbA1c is sustained through at least 1 year. Subjects with highest baseline HbA1c have the largest reduction and there are no reported differences in efficacy between younger and older subjects and no relation to the degree of obesity.38 Comparison with other agents in monotherapy A 24-week head-to-head study compared the effect of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily, n ¼ 519) with that of rosiglitazone (8 mg once daily, n ¼ 267) in subjects with type 2 diabetes with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.7%.39 HbA1c was reduced by 1.1% by vildagliptin versus 1.3% by rosiglitazone. Furthermore, a 52-week study examined the influence of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily; n ¼ 526) versus metformin (1 g twice daily; n ¼ 254) in subjects with type 2 diabetes with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.7%.40 Vildagliptin reduced HbA1c by 1.0%, which was not non-inferior to metformin, which reduced HbA1c by 1.4%.

Glycaemic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in combination therapy Combination with metformin A study examined the results by adding vildagliptin to ongoing treatment with metformin in patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.8% and who had been on metformin treatment for 2.3 years.41 During an initial 12-week study period (n ¼ 107), vildagliptin plus metformin reduced HbA1c levels by 0.7% when adjusted for effects of treatment with metformin alone. After a 40-week extension (n ¼ 71), vildagliptin reduced HbA1c by 1.1% versus placebo (Fig. 1). Similar results of reduction of HbA1c (by 1.1%) after a 24-week combination therapy with vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) and metformin was reported in another study in patients (n ¼ 362) with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.5%.42 Sitagliptin at 100 mg daily was added to ongoing metformin in subjects with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0% (n ¼ 701).43 After 24 weeks, HbA1c was reduced by the use of this combination by 0.65% compared to treatment with metformin alone (Fig. 2). A subsequent study examined the initial combination of sitagliptin (100 mg daily) and metformin (1 or 2 g daily) when compared to treatment with sitagliptin or metformin alone for 24 weeks (n ¼ 1091).44 Baseline HbA1c levels were 8.8% and a marked reduction in HbA1c was seen after combination therapy (1.6% and 2.1% in the two groups, respectively). Of the patients given sitagliptin in combination with metformin, 66% reached HbA1c <7.0% and 44% reached levels of <6.5%; corresponding figures for metformin alone were 38% and 20%, respectively.

Comparison with other agents as add-on to metformin A recent study compared the effect of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily; n ¼ 295) to that of pioglitazone (30 mg once daily; n ¼ 281) when added to ongoing treatment with metformin in subjects with baseline HbA1c of 8.4%.45 After 24 weeks, both vildagliptin (by 0.9%) and pioglitazone (by 1.0%) had reduced HbA1c with no significant difference between the groups. Another active-controlled study compared the effect of sitagliptin (100 mg daily) plus metformin versus metformin plus glipizide (up to 20 mg daily) in subjects (n ¼ 1172) with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.5%.46 The HbA1c was reduced by 0.67% in both groups. Sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) has also been compared to rosiglitazone (8 mg daily) when added to ongoing metformin in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control with metformin alone (mean HbA1c 7.7%; n ¼ 273). After 18 weeks, the HbA1c was reduced by 0.73% by sitagliptin

and 0.79% by rosiglitazone, the difference being statistically not significant .47 Hence, DPP-4 inhibition shows an efficient effect in improving glycaemic control as sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones when added to metformin. Combination with thizolidinediones A 6-month study in 463 patients (mean baseline HbA1c of 8.7%) examined treatment with vildagliptin at 50 or 100 mg versus placebo as add-on therapy to pioglitazone at 45 mg, respectively.48 HbA1c was reduced by vildagliptin by 0.8% at 50 mg and by 1.1% at 100 mg versus 0.3% in the placebo group treated with pioglitazone alone. Another placebo-controlled 6-month study evaluated the combination of sitagliptin (100 mg daily) with pioglitazone at 30 or 45 mg daily in patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0% (n ¼ 353; 49). HbA1c was reduced by 0.7% by sitagliptin and pioglitazone in combination versus pioglitazone alone; 45% of the subjects reached target for control (<7%) at the end of the study compared to 23% of patients treated with pioglitazone alone. Combination with sulfonylurea A 24-week study examined vildagliptin (50 mg once or twice daily) versus placebo when added to glimepiride (4 mg daily) in 515 patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of mean 8.5%.50 Placebo-adjusted HbA1c was reduced by 0.6% by vildagliptin at 50 mg once daily and 0.76% at 50 mg twice daily. Another placebo-controlled study examined the add-on of sitagliptin (100 mg daily) to glimepiride alone or glimepiride and metformin in patients (n ¼ 441) with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.3%. The placebosubtracted reduction in HbA1c was 0.7% in patients given sitagliptin and glimepiride and 0.9% in patients given triple therapy.51 Combination with insulin When vildagliptin was added to insulin in subjects with more advanced type 2 diabetes over 24 weeks (mean baseline HbA1c 8.9%), HbA1c was reduced by vildagliptin by 0.5% versus 0.2% in the group given insulin alone.52 This was associated with a reduced insulin dosage in the group given vildagliptin and insulin.

In summary, DPP-4 inhibition reduces HbA1C by 0.6­1.15% in monotherapy over 24­52 weeks; when added to metformin, sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors reduce HbA1C by 0.6­1.1%; head to head studies show that DPP-4 inhibitors are similar in potency when added to metformin as sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones; and DPP-4 inhibition improves glycaemic control when combined with insulin. Other effects of DPP-4 inhibitors Lipid metabolism In the clinical trials using monotherapy or combination therapy with vildagliptin or sitagliptin, only minor, if any, effects on lipids are seen. However, a recent study showed that vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks) reduced the prandial 8 h triglyceride response to a fat-rich meal by 85%.53 Similarly, chylomicron triglyceride was reduced by 91% and this was associated with reduction in chylomicron apolipoprotein B-48 and chylomicron cholesterol. This would add another potential beneficial effect of this novel form of therapy, considering the importance of prandial lipaemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms explaining these effects by vildagliptin remain to be explored in more detail. Blood pressure and electrocardiogram Reports on effects of DPP-4 inhibition on blood pressure are few. However, studies exploring this in more detail have shown that DPP-4 inhibition reduces blood pressure.54 No electrocardiogram changes have been observed during treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors. Safety and tolerability of DPP-4 inhibitors Adverse events Vildagliptin and sitagliptin have now been examined in a large number of subjects and shown to be tolerable and safe, both in short-term studies and in studies up to 1 year of duration.16,19,27­35,38­52,55 In these studies, the overall prevalence of adverse events has been similar to that seen in placebo groups both in monotherapy and in combination therapy with metformin, sulphonylurea or thiazolidinediones. Consequently, the drop-out rate from clinical trials with DPP-4 inhibitors due to adverse events has been very low. Specifically, DPP-4 inhibitors are not associated with nausea or vomiting, which are common adverse events for GLP-1 analogues.4,10,13 Nevertheless, in some studies, adverse events such as upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache have been reported, although the association of these adverse events with the compounds is not established, Saxagliptin too has been shown to be tolerable and safe36,37 although experience with this compound is more limited. Therefore, in clinical studies, DPP-4 inhibition is found to be safe and no specific adverse events have been detected. Hypoglycaemia The reported numbers of hypoglycaemic events in studies with vildagliptin and sitagliptin are very low. A pooled analysis for sitagliptin in monotherapy showed that the incidence of hypoglycaemia was 1.2% after treatment with sitagliptin at 100 mg daily versus 0.9% in the placebo group.1 Also as add-on therapy to metformin, DPP-4 inhibition shows a low degree of hypoglycaemia. Thus, when compared to sulphonylurea as add-on to metformin, sitagliptin showed substantially lower risk of hypoglycaemia (5%) than glipizide (32%).46 When combined with sulphonylurea, GLP-1 receptor agonists show increased risk of hypoglycaemia.10 This has been observed also for DPP-4 inhibition. Thus, when sitagliptin was added to ongoing glimepiride, there was an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia (12% vs. 2% in the group given glimepiride alone).51 Furthermore, when vildagliptin was added to glimepiride, a slight increase in the incidence of hypoglycaemia was reported (1.2% vs. 0.6% during treatment

with glimepiride alone)50; Therefore, a reduced dose of DPP-4 inhibitors or sulphonylureas is suggested when these are used in combination. Another interesting observation is that in the study in which vildagliptin was added to insulin, the number of hypoglycaemic events was lower in the vildagliptin-treated group (113 events) than in the placebo-treated group (185 events) in association with the more efficient reduction in HbA1c.52 Overall, these studies show a low risk for hypoglycaemia during treatment with DPP-4 inhibition. DPP-4 inhibitors inhibit glucagon secretion. This is of advantage at high glucose levels. However, a concern might be that if DPP-4 inhibition slows down glucagon secretion at low glucose levels as well, counter-regulation could be compromised. A recent study addressed this and showed that contrary to the inhibition of glucagon secretion after meal ingestion, that is, when glucose levels are elevated, the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia was not reduced by vildagliptin.56 Thus, glucagon secretion is preserved, not reduced, in hypoglycaemia in patients given DPP-4 inhibition and counter-regulation to hypoglycaemia is not compromised, suggesting that DPP-4 inhibition prevents hypoglycaemia.

Body weight DPP-4 inhibitors are body weight-neutral as shown in many studies.16,19,27­52,55 This body weightneutrality is different from the increase in body weight which is associated with treatment with thiazolidinediones, sulphonylureas and insulin. For example, in the head-to-head study comparing vildagliptin and pioglitazone as add-on to metformin over 24 weeks, vildagliptin was body weightneutral whereas body weight increased by 1.9 kg with pioglitazone.45 Similarly, when added to metformin over 18 weeks, sitagliptin did not reduce body weight when compared to placebo whereas rosiglitazone increased body weight by 1.5 kg.47 The body weight-neutrality is different from the reduction in body weight which is seen after GLP-1 receptor agonists,10 which is probably due to the different concentration of GLP-1 or GLP-1 receptor agonists in the two strategies.

Laboratory abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities in clinical studies with sitagliptin, vildagliptin or saxagliptin have been very low. As far as liver enzymes go, no abnormalities have been observed for sitagliptin or vildagliptin at 50 mg once or twice daily. However, treatment with vildagliptin at 100 mg once daily resulted in a slightly higher incidence of elevated liver enzymes.57 Therefore, vildagliptin should be used at 50 mg once or twice daily, a dose at which no increase in liver enzymes has been observed. In the label, it will be stated that liver enzymes need to be determined before onset of vildagliptin treatment and at 3-month intervals during the first year of treatment.

Renal insufficiency Whereas vildagliptin, to a large extent, is eliminated through hepatic metabolism and not through renal clearance, sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated as unchanged drug.1 Therefore, renal insufficiency increases circulating levels of sitagliptin, and compared to healthy subjects, sitagliptin exposure following administration is increased 2.3-, 3.8- and 4.5-fold in subjects with mild, severe or end-stage renal insufficiency.15 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has therefore recommended that renal function is assessed prior to start of treatment with sitagliptin and that in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance <50 ml minÀ1) or severe (creatinine clearance <30 ml minÀ1) renal insufficiency, the dose should be reduced to 50 mg and 25 mg, compared to the regular dose of 100 mg daily. A recent study explored the effect of sitagliptin in subjects with moderate to severe renal insufficiency including patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis.58 The study showed that sitagliptin improved glycaemia in these patients as well, with a low degree of adverse events when used at a lower dose of 50 mg or 25 mg daily. Since no such study has been reported yet for vildagliptin, FDA has asked for one in subjects with renal insufficieny also for this compound before approval.

Other bioactive peptides In addition to GLP-1, DPP-4 has the potential of cleaving a number of bioactive compounds.14For example, it might inactivate substance P, neuropeptide Y and chemokines. This may imply that DPP-4 is involved in not only glucose homeostasis but also the regulation of other homeostatic mechanisms, such as blood pressure, neurogenic inflammation and the immune system, which therefore would be potential areas of adverse events during treatment with DPP-4 inhibition. However, no such adverse events have been reported in animal studies or patients given DPP-4 inhibition. Therefore, the potential prevention of the degradation of these other bioactive peptides by DPP-4 inhibition does not seem to be of clinical importance. It should be underlined that it is not known whether these other potential substrates are indeed substrates for DPP-4 under physiological conditions in humans, since it has only been demonstrated in vitro. Nevertheless, it is important to closely monitor for adverse events that might be connected to these other peptides. DPP-4 specificity A concern during the development of DPP-4 inhibitors has previously been the result of a study demonstrating that a compound which inhibits DPP-8 and DPP-9 is severely toxic to rodents.59 DPP-8 and DPP-9 belong to the same enzyme family as DPP-4, although their functions are not known. To avoid potential events through these enzymes, it has been considered important for DPP-4 inhibitors to be selective for DPP-4 over DPP-8 and DPP-9. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin show high selectivity for DPP-4, with sitagliptin being the most selective of the three. However, a recent study showed that no toxicity was observed when DPP-8 and DPP-9 were inhibited by a very high dose of vildagliptin in animals60 and, furthermore, no toxicity related to DPP-8 or DPP-9 has been observed in pre-clinical studies with DPP-4 inhibitors. Therefore, the finding that a compound inhibiting DPP-8 and DPP-9 causes toxicity59 is probably related to toxicity of the specific compound used rather than its effect of inhibiting DPP enzymes. Hence, there is now no concern that sitagliptin, vildagliptin or saxagliptin would result in a potential toxicity related to DPP-8 or DPP-9. In summary, DPP-4 inhibition (1) is not associated with more adverse events than placebo; (2) is associated with lower degree of adverse events than sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones; (3) exhibits a low risk of hypoglycaemia; and (4) is associated with augmented glucagon response to hypoglycaemia, i.e., protects from hypoglycaemia. Conclusion DPP-4 inhibition is a novel and promising oral therapy of type 2 diabetes and several compounds are now in development. As has been summarised here, vildagliptin, sitagliptin and saxagliptin are all orally active, safe and highly tolerable and studies in subjects with type 2 diabetes show sustained robust and clinically significant improvement in glycaemia, both in monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones. There seems also to be a good effect as add-on to insulin therapy, although experience with this combination is more limited. Mechanics of DPP-4 inhibition have been explored extensively for vildagliptin and show that DPP-4 inhibition works through preventing the inactivation of the incretin hormone GLP-1, which stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion with a potential of increased beta-cell mass also.2 The pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms of action, the efficacy and tolerability and the oral availability suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors may be of great value as a novel arsenal for treatment. The positioning of DPP-4 inhibitors in therapy is now important to define. Metformin is the first-line pharmacological therapy of present-day type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise fail to adequately control the glycaemia. This will not be replaced by DPP-4 inhibition. A positioning of DPP-4 inhibition in monotherapy would therefore instead be in subjects in whom metformin is contraindicated or those with adverse events from metformin. The main potential positioning of DPP-4 inhibition is, however, as add-on to ongoing metformin in patients with inadequate glycaemic control during treatment with metformin alone. This is evident from the marked improvement in glycaemia following combination therapy of DPP-4 inhibition with metformin. Initial combination with DPP-4

¨ inhibitors and metformin in drug-naive patients requiring pharmacological treatment for glycaemic control would be another situation for the therapy. A recent study presented a mechanistic rationale for the potent action of DPP-4 inhibition plus metformin. Thus, it was shown that metformin by itself increased GLP-1 concentrations, probably through a stimulation of GLP-1 secretion, and therefore when combined with a DPP-4 inhibitor, an augmented increase in active GLP-1 was observed.61 Another important positioning for DPP-4 inhibition would be exchanging sulphonylurea plus metformin or thiazolidinediones plus metformin to DPP-4 inhibition plus metformin in subjects with intolerance to sulphonylurea or thiazolidindediones or inadequate glycaemic control with these combinations. Furthermore, DPP-4 inhibition also has an important place as add-on to sulphonylurea or thiazolidinediones in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control when treated with these agents alone. A potential future combination would also be DPP-4 inhibition plus insulin. DPP-4 inhibition may also have advantages over existing treatment in long-term therapy of more advanced stages of the disease, provided that the beneficial effects on islet mass are also evident in humans, as has been shown in rodents.25,26 Finally, DPP-4 inhibition will be a strong candidate to be placed as a first-line treatment for impaired glucose tolerance, when this condition will be pharmacologically treated.32 The positioning of DPP-4 inhibition in relation to GLP-1 receptor agonists is an important area to explore. GLP-1 receptor agonists show several characteristics which are similar to DPP-4 inhibition, although differences exist as well.4 In particular, it's important to perform head-to-head studies comparing the two strategies under different conditions. The reduction in HbA1c by DPP-4 inhibition is similar to that by metformin, sulphonylurea or thiazolidinediones. This high efficacy might be surprising in view of the finding that GLP-1 levels are increased only by two- or threefold. One explanation is that the portal concentration of GLP-1 is substantially higher than the peripheral concentration during DPP-4 inhibition.62 Since a large portion of GLP-1 effects is executed indirectly through activation of portal GLP-1 receptors which activate afferent nerves, the portal GLP-1 levels are probably more relevant than the peripheral levels.4 Another explanation for the high efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors is that other bioactive peptides may also contribute to the effect of DPP-4, which would add to the beneficial effect of GLP-1. The other incretin, GIP, is thereby an obvious candidate since GLP-1 levels are increased by DPP-4 inhibition17 and GIP is a powerful stimulator of insulin secretion.4 In type 2 diabetes the effect of GIP is impaired, which probably is due to impaired or reduced expression of the GIP receptor.4 Therefore, GIP may be expected not to contribute to the beneficial effect of DPP-4 inhibition. However, an experimental study in rats has shown that normalising glycaemia restores the effect of GIP.63 Hence, if that applies to humans as well (which remains to be established) when patients are given DPP-4 inhibitors for a longer period of time, after reducing the glycaemia GIP may also contribute. Another potential candidate would be pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), which is a neuropeptide with potent action for stimulating insulin secretion; PACAP is inactivated by DPP-4 and its effects are augmented by DPP-4 inhibition.64 In conclusion, DPP-4 inhibition is efficient in improving glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes both in monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulphonylurea and thiazolidinediones. Furthermore, the compounds are safe and well-tolerated. It is suggested that DPP-4 inhibitors may be used preferentially as add-on to metformin, sulfonylurea and thiazolidinediones in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control. Now the long-term durability and effects on long-term end points are required for this class of compounds. Important future studies with DPP-4 inhibitors include (1) long-term efficacy studies; (2) long-term tolerability studies; (3) long-term studies with cardiovascular end points; (4) head-to-head comparison with GLP-1 receptor agonists; (5) head-to-head studies comparing different DPP-4 inhibitors; (6) studies with DPP-4 inhibition in combination with insulin; and (7) mechanistic studies including longterm effects on sustainability of islet effects. Summary The DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin and vildagliptin, have been shown to improve metabolic control in type 2 diabetes in monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulphonylurea and thiazolidinediones in studies up to 52 weeks. HbA1c is reduced by approximately 0.6­1.1%. Similar, albeit more

limited, results exist for saxagliptin. DPP-4 inhibitors are safe and tolerable with no increased risk of adverse events compared to placebo and they are associated with only a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The DPP-4 inhibitors are suggested to be used in the early stage of type 2 diabetes, with a main indication in combination with metformin in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control when treated with metformin alone. DPP-4 inhibition may also be used in combination with sulphonylurea and thiazolidinediones. The durability and long-term safety of DPP-4 inhibition remains to be established. References
