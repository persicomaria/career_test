Abstract--The ribosomal decoding site is the target of aminoglycoside antibiotics that specifically recognize an internal loop RNA structure. We synthesized RNA-targeted 2,5-dideoxystreptamine-4-amides in which a sugar moiety in natural aminoglycosides is replaced by heterocycles. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The bacterial ribosome is the primary target for a variety of antibiotics that have been shown to interact predominantly with the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) components.1,2 The decoding site internal loop RNA (Fig. 1B) within the 30S ribosomal subunit is specifically recognized by aminoglycoside antibiotics3 such as neomycin (1) and paromomycin (2) (Fig. 1A) that, upon binding, interfere with translation fidelity,4 which ultimately leads to bacterial cell death. The molecular basis of decoding site RNA recognition by natural aminoglycosides1,2,5À8 and synthetic derivatives9À12 has been subject to numerous studies. For both the decoding site RNA and the whole 30S ribosomal subunit complexed with aminoglycosides three-dimensional structures have been determined recently,2,6,7 providing the foundation for structure-based design of novel antibiotics13 superior to aminoglycosides. The efficacy of the natural antibiotics is compromised by bacterial resistance14 and undesirable pharmacological profiles. Nevertheless, aminoglycosides are recognized as the lead paradigm in RNA target recognition,15 providing starting points for the design of RNA binders. The immense challenge of selective derivatization of the natural aminoglycosides, however, has led the effort to

use smaller fragments, such as neamine (3),10,12,16 paromamine (4),11,17 and 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) (5)18À20 (Fig. 1A), as scaffolds for synthesis. The 2-DOS core, conserved among biologically active aminoglycosides, lends itself to the construction of decoding sitetargeted ligands, as it contains a unique spatial arrangement of amino groups, that is deemed crucial to the recognition of the bacterial rRNA target.2,6,7 Moreover, 2-DOS is readily available by chemical degradation of natural aminoglycosides.21 Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and preliminary testing of 2-DOS-4-carboxyl amides. Structural data from X-ray crystallography,2,7 along with our own molecular modelling studies22 and a previous investigation,19 suggested that the pyranose ring, linked to the 4position of 2-DOS in many natural aminoglycosides, might be replaced by planar non-sugar moieties that combine the potential for both stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions, along with straightforward accessibility by medicinal chemistry. In a similar previous study, the 4-hydroxyl group of 2-DOS served as a handle for the formation of a variety of ethers, yielding weak binding nonglycosidic 2-DOS derivatives that displayed affinity for the bacterial decoding site RNA in the range of 300 mM and higher.19 Our design is based on amides formed through an activated carboxyl group introduced at the 4-position of 2-DOS. The amide

functionality provides a rigid linkage between the attached scaffold and 2-DOS, and may allow for additional hydrogen bond interactions with the RNA target. We hypothesized that both the increased compound rigidity and hydrogen bonding potential might yield nonglycosidic 2-DOS derivatives of improved affinity for the decoding site RNA. The starting material for our synthetic efforts was obtained by hydrolytic degradation of commercially available neomycin sulfate (1), as previously described (Scheme 1).21 Thus, treatment of 1 with concentrated HBr (48%) under reflux conditions produced the dihydrobromide salt of 2-DOS (5) in 91% yield. The amine-functionalities of 2-DOS were protected as the corresponding azides using triflic azide23 in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuSO4.24 Subsequent treatment with acetic anhydride and 4-DMAP (catalytic) in

pyridine furnished the peracetylated product in 87% yield over two steps. Enzymatic resolution by Novozym 435 in toluene/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) produced optically pure 6 in 96% yield.10 Various different protecting strategies were examined at this point for their compatibility with the planned synthetic sequence. Specifically, silicon-protecting groups proved to be highly prone to migration under the basic reaction conditions used in the following steps (Scheme 1). Similar results were obtained from the use of esters for the protection of the hydroxyl-groups, that led to loss of optical purity due to migration between positions 4, 5, and 6. Methoxymethyl-ethers were unsuitable due to their unique deprotection requirements (strong protic or Lewis acids) interfering with other functionalities at later stages of the synthesis. Benzylic ethers proved to be compatible with the desired chemistry, especially

because of their introduction under mildly acidic conditions, as well as their stability to base treatment. Specifically, reaction of (6) with p-methoxybenzyl trichloroacetimidate [PMBOC(¼NH)CCl3] in the

presence of a catalytic amount of CSA,25 furnished the desired PMB-ether 7 in 94% yield. Hydrolysis of the two acetates in 7 with NaOMe in methanol, followed by di-benzylation (BnBr, NaH) and oxidative removal of the PMB-functionality, produced advanced intermediate 9 in 75% overall yield. Initial attempts to introduce the equatorial carbonylgroup at the C-4 position of 2-DOS involved nucleophilic displacement of an axial iodide-functionality with an appropriate acyl-anion equivalent. Thus, treatment of 9 with Tf2O and pyridine produced the corresponding triflate, which was further reacted with tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) in refluxing benzene to furnish axial iodide 10 in 82% yield for the two steps.26 Attempts to displace the iodide with different nucleophiles, including potassium cyanide, trimethylsilyl-cyanide,27 vinyl-magnesium bromide (with or without copper catalysis), (vinyl)2Cu(CN)Li228 and 1,3-dithiane anion resulted in decomposition or elimination. Similar results were obtained when different nitrogenprotecting strategies (Boc-, Cbz-) were employed, directing us to modify our approach. Alternatively, the desired carbonyl-functionality could be introduced by a Wittig reaction between the corresponding ketone at the 4-position of 2-DOS and the phosphorus ylide produced from (methoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide, followed by acidhydrolysis. Since this direct transformation is not compatible with the azide-functionality due to the potential formation of iminophosphorane intermediates, a twostep reduction/Cbz-protection sequence was performed (Staudinger reduction, Cbz-Cl/NaHCO3), furnishing alcohol 11 in 87% overall yield (Scheme 1). Thus, alcohol 11 was oxidized to the desired cyclohexanone 12, following Swern's protocol, in 93% yield. The Wittig reaction was performed as shown in Scheme 1. After hydrolysis of the resulting enol-ether with CSA in THF/ H2O we unexpectedly obtained the ,-unsaturated aldehyde 14,29 as the result of a simultaneous hydrolysis-elimination sequence, in 33% overall yield. Obviously, the presence of the benzyl ether at the position of the newly formed carbonyl group promoted acid-induced elimination. We nevertheless decided to continue with the synthesis of the 2,5-dideoxystreptamine (2,5-dDOS) derivatives since 5-deoxyneamine, a 2,5-dDOS derivative, was shown to also have antimicrobial activity, including potency superior to neamine against two kanamycin-resistant strains.30 The further oxidation of aldehyde 14 by sodium chlorite afforded the advanced intermediate carboxylic acid 15 in 97% yield.31 Synthesis of the final amide 2,5-dDOS analogues was performed as outlined in Scheme 2. Thus, carboxylic acid 15 was treated with Vilsmeier salt (DMF/oxalyl chloride) to produce the corresponding acyl-chlorides, which were further reacted with 10 amines (16a­j) in the presence of triethylamine, furnishing the desired protected amides. Global deprotection was accomplished by catalytic hydrogenation in acetic acid/water, resulting after concurrent stereoselective saturation of the

a The coupled in vitro transcription-translation assay was carried out in a 384-well plate. The compounds were incubated with bacterial S30 extract (Promega) followed by a mixture containing nucleotide triphosphates, amino acids and pBESTlucTM plasmid DNA (Promega) encoding the luciferase reporter. Plates were incubated at 25 C for 20 min. After cooling on ice, SteadyGlowTM luciferin substrate (Promega) was added followed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Light emission in the plates was recorded with a TopCountTM (Perkin-Elmer) luminescence counter. Each compound was tested in a dose­response fashion at concentrations ranging from 1 mM to 100 nM. IC50 values were determined from light unit versus log(c) plots by fitting to a variable slope dose­response equation. Six replicates were run per concentration. An excellent signal-to-noise ratio was obtained in the assay attested by Z0 values33 in the range of 0.60­0.70 per plate. To rule out that active compounds were inhibitors of the bacterial RNA polymerase or firefly luciferase reporter enzyme, all compounds were counter-screened against polymerase and luciferase. None of the paromamine derivatives inhibited either polymerase or luciferase. b A counter screen suggested that compounds 17a and 17j are inhibitors of the luciferase reporter enzyme.

The inactivity of the synthesized 2,5-dDOS-4-amides suggests that the scaffolds linked to the 2,5-dDOS core are not able to substitute for the interactions of the amino-sugar in the active natural aminoglycosides neamine (3) and paromamine (4). This observation is in line with the previously observed weak binding in the high micromolar range of 2-DOS-4-ether derivatives.19 Alternatively, the amide linkage between the non-sugar scaffolds and 2,5-dDOS, initially designed to provide increased compound rigidity, may lock the 2,5-dDOS-4amides in an unfavourable conformation for recognition of the decoding site RNA target. The overall low activity of nonglycosidic 2,5-dDOS derivatives as inhibitors of bacterial translation underlines the exquisitely sensitive structure­function relationship in the aminoglycosides targeting the decoding site RNA, and their privileged combination of three-dimensional structure definition and presentation of polar functionality.15 This is confirmed by a recently published high-quality crystal structure of paromomycin bound to a decoding site RNA construct,7 which reveals numerous key interactions between the paromamine core (see Fig. 1) and the RNA, aligning the pyranose ring in a striking Watson­Crick base pair-like fashion with the adenine 1408 base.7 While the low activity of the 2,5-dDOS-4-amides rules out their further exploitation as ligands for the bacterial decoding site RNA, the synthesized compounds will be further tested in assays of other RNA targets involved in pathogenic processes. The composition of the described 2,5-dDOS derivatives, obtained by the careful choice of amines used in the coupling, renders them as generally `RNA-friendly' compounds that are valuable to build an exploratory library suitable for screening against any RNA target of interest.

double bond, in the final compounds 17a­j in good to excellent overall yields (Scheme 2).32 The biological activity of the compounds was evaluated in a coupled in vitro transcription­translation assay using firefly luciferase as a reporter (Table 1). The translation assay uses a bacterial extract, containing functional ribosomes, to synthesize luciferase protein in vitro. The produced luficerase enzyme is quantified by subsequent addition of luficerin substrate, giving rise to a light signal that is proportional to the amount of functional luciferase present. Inhibitors of translation, such as ribosomal A site RNA-binding compounds, interfere with the production of luciferase enzyme, thereby reducing the observed light emission. Potential inhibition of luciferase itself was subsequently tested in a counter screen in which a predetermined amount of luciferase was incubated with luciferin substrate in the presence of compound. Three anilides (17a, 17b, and 17j) inhibited the assay at medium to high micromolar concentrations. Two of the active compounds (17a and 17j) were identified as inhibitors of the luciferase reporter enzyme. Thus, it was not possible to determine their inhibition of translation. The single remaining bona fide inhibitor of bacterial translation, the cyano-anilide (17b) was roughly two orders of magnitude less active than the paradigm compound paromamine (4). 2-DOS (5) itself and the unsubstituted 2,5-dDOS-4-amide (17i) did not inhibit the translation assay, revealing the inability of the isolated DOS core to recognize the decoding site RNA despite its conservation in biologically active aminoglycoside antibiotics.
