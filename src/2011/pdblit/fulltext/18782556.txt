The structure of aldehyde reductase (ALR1) in ternary complex with the coenzyme NADPH and [5-(3carboxymethoxy-4-methoxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl]acetic acid (CMD), a potent inhibitor of aldose reductase (ALR2), was determined at 1.99 Å resolution. The partially disordered inhibitor formed a tight network of hydrogen bonds with the active site residues (Tyr50 and His113) and coenzyme. Molecular modelling calculations and inhibitory activity measurements of CMD and [5-(3hydroxy-4-methoxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl]acetic acid (HMD) indicated that p-stacking interactions with several conserved active site tryptophan residues and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the non-conserved C-terminal residue Leu300 in ALR2 (Pro301 in ALR1) contributed to inhibitor selectivity. In particular for the potent inhibitor CMD, the rotameric state of the conserved residue Trp219 (Trp220 in ALR1) is important in forming a p-stacking interaction with the inhibitor in ALR2 and contributes to the difference in the binding of the inhibitor to the enzymes.

1. Introduction Aldose reductase (ALR2; EC 1.1.1.21), the first enzyme of the polyol pathway responsible for converting glucose into sorbitol [1], has been isolated and purified from cytosols of a number of mammalian tissues including brain, liver, lens, skeletal muscle and adrenal gland [2­7]. In addition to polyol synthesis, the enzyme shows broad substrate specificity for aldehydes and dicarbonyl compounds and is thought to play physiological roles in osmotic homeostasis, steroid and xenobiotic metabolism, and signal processing and oxidative defence mechanisms [8­10]. The mammalian enzymes are monomers of 316 residues with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa, and adopt triose phosphate isomerase barrel (TIM-barrel) structures comprising eight a-helices surrounding eight b-strands [11­15]. ALR2 belongs to the AKR1B subfamily of the

aldo­keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, which includes more than 140 proteins with different physiological roles [16]. Glucose metabolism, specifically via ALR2 and the polyol pathway, is often linked to the development of chronic complications of diabetes mellitus, a widely growing metabolic disease [17,18] whose associated pathologies include peripheral neuropathy [19], blindness in the form of retinopathy [20] and cataract formation [21], cardiovascular disease [22] and nephropathy [23]. The development of a potent and targeted aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) is a high priority in addressing diabetic complications, but remains largely hindered by problems with toxicity [24] and lack of targeted specificity towards the enzyme. ARIs have been shown to readily inhibit members of the AKR superfamily, including hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases [25] and in particular aldehyde reductase (ALR1, EC 1.1.1.2) [26]. ALR1 shows approximately 50% amino acid sequence identity with ALR2, and belongs to the AKR1A subfamily of the AKR superfamily [11,16,27]. Like ALR2, ALR1 catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of an assortment of small molecules, in particular aldehydes, dicarbonyl compounds and uronic acids [28­31] and is responsible for ascorbic acid synthesis in mammals by efficient reduction of D-glucuronate to L-gulonate [32] and detoxication by processing reactive dicarbonyl

compounds [33,34]. However, the two enzymes share a highly conserved active-site consisting of tyrosine, histidine and tryptophan which form an avid substrate/anionic-binding site [35­42]. Some potent ARIs such as carboxylic acid- and cyclic imide-based molecules form tight interactions at the anionic-binding site [42­44] while interactions with non-conserved active-site residues are responsible for the difference in inhibitor potency towards the enzymes. In this study, we describe the ternary structure of porcine ALR1 in complex with a potent inhibitor belonging to the 5-arylidene-2,4thiazolidinediones class of ARIs [45]. The crystal structure of ALR1 in complex with coenzyme (NADPH) and the inhibitor [5-(3-carboxymethoxy-4-methoxybenzylidene)-2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl]acetic acid (CMD) was determined at 1.99 Å resolution (Scheme 1). CMD and its analogous inhibitor [5-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzylidene)2,4-dioxothiazolidin-3-yl]acetic acid (HMD) [45] were modelled in the active sites of the enzymes and a parallel was drawn between the

interactions of the ALR1 and ALR2 enzymes and the selected 5arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinediones in conjunction with inhibitory activity measurements. The common manner by which the inhibitors are assumed to bind both ALR1 and ALR2 indicate that Pro301 in ALR1 and Leu300 in ALR2 as well as the consistent level of p-stacking interactions with a number of conserved tryptophan residues within the active sites, account for the difference in inhibitor potency between the two enzymes. Like a previous study on the binding of the inhibitor Fidarestat to ALR1 and ALR2 [42,43], both conserved and non-conserved residues account for the difference in potency towards the two enzymes. 2. Results 2.1. X-Ray crystallography The eight-stranded a/b-barrel structure of porcine ALR1 holoenzyme in complex with CMD was determined at 1.99 Å resolution, with final Rcryst and Rfree values equal to 19.2% and 24.6%, respectively (Table 1). The crystal structure includes one coenzyme (NADPH) molecule, 352 waters and three sulfate molecules. The inhibitor occupied the active site, however, the thiazolidinedione ring portion of the molecule was disordered revealing poor to no electron density (Fig.1). The asymmetric unit consisted of 315 amino acids, with poor side chain density for active site loop regions corresponding to residues 219­224 and 303­309, while density for the main chain portions of the loop remained relatively intact. The IC50 value for the compound CMD crystallised with ALR1 was found to be 27-fold higher than the published IC50 value with ALR2 (Table 2) [45]. Refinement of the ALR1 structure showed a number of interactions for CMD with the coenzyme NADPH and the residues forming the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 2a). The carboxyl part of the carboxymethoxy group of CMD formed hydrogen bonds with the catalytic residues His113 (NE1: 2.7 Å), Tyr50 (OH: 2.62 Å) and NADPH (O7N: 3.4 Å), and its phenyl ring partially p-stacks with Trp22 (4.13 Å). While interactions made by the thiazolidinedione ring of CMD are difficult to characterize due

to the poor electron density corresponding to this portion of the molecule, it was sandwiched between the active site loops B and C (Fig. 2b), suggesting possible encompassing interactions with the main chains of Ile299, Val300, Arg218 and Ala219.

3. Discussion The side chains of Tyr48, Lys77 and His110 helps to make up the anionic- or substrate- binding site of ALR2. These amino acids are included among residues which are repeated in similar positions in ALR1 and a number of AKRs, and enable the catalytic reaction mechanism to take place [46,47]. Interactions with these residues in either enzyme strongly anchor inhibitors, in particular carboxylic acid-based inhibitors such as tolrestat and 3,5-dichlorosalicylic acid [42], within the active site. In the case of the ternary crystal structure of ALR1 in complex with the ALR2 inhibitor CMD [45], the 3-carboxymethoxy-4-methoxybenzylidene moiety remains tightly anchored to the anionicbinding site of the enzyme and partially p-stacks with Trp22, producing the only clearly delineated electron density for the inhibitor. Analogous interactions are clearly mimicked by the modelled ALR2:CMD complex. A number of differences demarcate the active sites of ALR2 and ALR1, including the overall apolar nature of ALR2 and the unique active site loop regions (residues 219­224 and 303­309) of ALR1 which are quite flexible in the conformation of the main chain and side chain rotamers [42,43]. Of particular importance for the selectivity towards ALR2 of 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinediones under study is Leu300 producing a hydrogen bond contact with its main chain nitrogen and the 3-acetic acid moiety of CMD and the 3-hydroxy group of HMD. In ALR1, this residue is replaced by Pro301 and is incapable of producing a hydrogen bond contact with CMD or HMD, an observation made on a number of ALR2/ALR1 ternary complexes with ARIs such as the cyclic imide-based inhibitors of Minalrestat and Fidarestat [39,43]. This adds to the growing evidence that Leu300 is a predominant contributor towards inhibitor selectivity. The disordered density for the (2,4-dioxothiazolidine-3-yl) acetic acid portion of the inhibitor may be due in part to a failure in forming a stabilizing-hydrogen bond contact with Pro301 which is within 4 Å of the inhibitor. Full or partial tryptophan p-stacking is a common feature of the crystal and modelled structures of ALR2 and ALR1 with either CMD or HMD. These p-stacking interactions contribute to stronger binding in ALR2 than ALR1 based on energy calculations. However, for residues such as Trp22 and Trp20 in ALR1, Trp82 and Trp79 in ALR2 these interactions remain relatively similar. The poor electron density corresponding to the 2,4-thiazolidindione moiety of CMD is adjacent to Trp220 in ALR1 and does not form a p-stacking interaction with Trp219 in ALR2 (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, while the corresponding electron density for the side chain of Trp220 is also poor, it adopts a rotamer conformation not observed in the ALR2 structure (Fig. 3) where Trp219 produced a more favourable interaction energy. This is not unusual for ALR1 and Trp220 as it adopts a disordered split conformation when complexed with the cyclic imide inhibitor Fidarestat [43], whereas in ALR2 crystal structure the side chain of Trp219 forms a strong and ordered hydrogen-bond contact with the same inhibitor [39]. Another significant difference in the modelling of ALR1/HMD ternary complex was that the 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzylidene ring only partially stacks with Trp114 unlike in ALR2 where it fully stacks with Trp111. As seen in modelled structures of Minalrestat and ALR1 [42] failure of the fluorobenzyl group of the inhibitor to p-stack against Trp114 is due to partial steric interference by Tyr116 that, instead, is replaced by the smaller Thr113 within the specificity pocket described for ALR2. This explains the difference in the level of inhibitor/tryptophan stacking between the enzymes in that part of the active site and while Tyr116 makes hydrogen bond contacts with HMD in ALR1, it does not compensate for the missing full p-stacking interaction with Trp114.

2.2. Molecular modelling 2.2.1. CMD and ALR2 The orientation of CMD based on the ternary structure of ALR1 was used to model interactions within the active site of human ALR2 (PDB code 1PWM). The modelled ALR2:CMD complex (Fig. 2c) forms a number of interactions with active site residues, the majority by the carboxyl part of the carboxymethoxy group with His110 (NE1: 2.7 Å), Tyr48 (OH: 3.4 Å), while the 3-carboxylate of the thiazolidinedione ring makes contact with the main chain nitrogens of Leu300 (3.7 Å) and Leu301 (2.6 Å). An additional polar contact is made by the 2-oxo group of the thiazolidinedione ring with the main chain nitrogen of Leu300 (3.3 Å). Both the thiazolidinedione and benzene ring form p-stacking interactions with Trp219 (3.7 Å) and Trp20 (3.6 Å), respectively. These findings are in agreement with the results obtained from a previously reported molecular docking study of CMD into the ALR2 active site [45]. 2.2.2. Models of ALR1 and ALR2 bound with HMD The IC50 value of HMD for ALR1 was 56-fold higher than that found with ALR2 (Table 2) [45]. Utilising the ternary structure of ALR1 with CMD and the observations of Maccari et al. [45], HMD was modelled into the active site of both ALR1 and ALR2 (Fig. 2d and e) to discern major differences in inhibitor binding. The carboxylate of the modelled HMD in ALR1 makes long hydrogen bond contacts with His113 (NE1: 3.5 Å) and Tyr50 (OH: 3.9 Å), whereas the 3-hydroxy group forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr116 (OH: 2.9 Å). The oxygen of the 4-methoxy group is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Tyr116 (OH: 2.7 Å), Arg312 (NH2: 3.5 Å) and Asp313 (OD2: 2.9 Å). The 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzylidene ring partially stacks with Trp114 (3.4 Å), with the carboxylate and 2,4-thiazolidine ring partially stacking with Trp22 (3.8 Å). In the ALR2:HMD modelled structure, the carboxylate of the inhibitor forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr48 (OH: 3.7 Å), while His110 (NE1) makes hydrogen bonds with the 2-oxo group (3.0 Å) and nitrogen moiety (3.2 Å) on the thiazolidine ring. The 3-hydroxy group forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen of Leu300 (N: 3.4 Å) and Tyr309 (OH: 3.4 Å). Unlike the ALR1:HMD complex, the benzene ring stacks fully with Trp111 (3.9 Å) while the thiazolidine ring partially stacks with Trp20 (4.2 Å). 2.2.3. Energy calculations Binding enthalpy (DH) calculations for the modelled inhibitors and the crystal structure of ALR1:CMD complex mimicked to some degree the change in inhibitor potency for either ALR1 or ALR2 (Table 2). The conserved number of tryptophan residues produced a consistent level of p-stacking for each ternary complex, in turn producing favourable interaction energy between receptor and ligand. For the modelled ALR2:CMD complex, Trp219 and Trp20 produced a total DH of À20.8 kcal, 2-fold greater than that of the ALR1:CMD crystal structure for residues Trp220 and Trp22 (À9.7 kcal). Tryptophan interaction energies for the modelled HMD ternary structures were also 1.5-fold greater for ALR2 and residues Trp20 and Trp111 (À19.8 kcal) when compared to ALR1 and residues Trp22 and Trp114 (À13.5 kcal). Hydrogen bond interactions with Leu300 in both the ALR2:CMD and HMD complexes were also prominent with DH values of À11.3 and À5.4 kcal, respectively, while Pro301 in the place of Leu300 in ALR1 produced smaller DH values, À2.4 and À1.8 kcal, respectively.

5.3. Crystallization and X-ray data collection Crystals of the ALR1 holoenzyme were grown using the hanging drop method [48] and a final enzyme concentration of 18 mg/mL mixed with coenzyme (NADPH) and inhibitor in a 1:20:3 molar ratio. Crystals grew to their maximum dimensions (0.80 Â 0.15 Â 0.15 mm) within ten days in a solution containing 2.0 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Tris­HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The crystals were then briefly immersed in cryo-protectant (20% v/v glycerol in 2.0 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Tris­HCl buffer, pH 8.5) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to X-ray diffraction. Data were collected at 100 K at the Australian synchrotron beamline 3-BM1 using Blu-Ice [49] and processed with XDS and SCALA [50]. The exposure time (2 s), oscillation range (1 ) and crystal-detector distance (250 mm) were adjusted to optimize the collection of a near complete data set to a resolution of 1.99 Å. The ternary complex crystallised in the hexagonal space group P6522, with one monomer per asymmetric unit. The solvent content was estimated to occupy 34.7% of the unit cell volume with a Matthews' coefficient [51] of 1.90. Data collection and processing statistics are shown in Table 1. 5.4.

4. Conclusion The first high-resolution ALR1 crystal structure in complex with a 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedione ARI complemented with molecular modelling of 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinediones in ALR2 and ALR1 helped to explain the difference in inhibitor potency by virtue of tracking active site interactions. With the crystal structure and modelled HMD and CMD ternary complexes, we note that the inhibitors form a hydrogen bond with the main chain N atom of Leu300 in ALR2, an interaction which is not possible in ALR1 and one which may help stabilise the ARI in ALR2 and the partially disordered nature of CMD in ALR1. p-Stacking interactions amongst the conserved residues specifically Trp219 in ALR2 also contributes to higher inhibitor potency for ALR2 over ALR1. 5. Experimental protocols 5.1. Purification of porcine ALR1 Porcine ALR1 was purified to homogeneity from porcine kidney following established methodologies [43]. For crystallization purposes, the purified enzyme solution in 5 mM Tris­HCl (pH 6.5) containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol was concentrated in excess of 17 mg/mL by ultrafiltration. 5.2. Assay of enzyme activity The enzyme activity of ALR1 was measured at 298 K by monitoring the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm in 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 6.7), 5 mM DL-glyceraldehyde, 0.1 mM NADPH and enzyme. Inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added into the reaction mixture to be less than 1.5% of dimethyl sulfoxide. The IC50 value was estimated from non-linear regression analysis of percent inhibition versus inhibitor concentration graph and expressed as the mean of at least three determinations.

The coordinates for porcine ALR1 holoenzyme structure (PDB code 3CV7) [44] was used to solve the ternary structure by molecular replacement utilising MOLREP in the CCP4 suite of crystallographic programs [52]. Structural refinement was carried out using REFMAC [53] with the initial model subjected to multiple cycles of manual fitting into 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron density maps using Coot [54], with the inhibitor, waters and sulfate molecules added towards the end of the refinement (Table 1). Atomic coordinates for the ternary complex were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 3FX4). 5.5. Molecular modelling To relieve any steric hindrance of the ARIs superimposed in the corresponding active sites of ALR2 and ALR1, the complexes were subjected to energy minimization with side chain conformations of amino acid residues manually adjusted to a minimum to accommodate each superimposed inhibitor where necessary in order to conserve the conformational aspects of inhibitor binding. Energy minimization was carried out using the Discover 2.7 program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, California, USA) on a Linux workstation following published protocols [55,56]. Briefly, calculations including a constant-valence force field incorporating the simple harmonic function for bond stretching and excluding all non-diagonal terms were carried out (cut-off distance of 26 Å) using the steepest-descent and conjugate-gradient algorithms (down to a maximum atomic root-mean-square derivative of 10.0 kcal/Å and 0.01 kcal/Å, respectively). Force field potentials and partial charges were automatically assigned and visualized using InsightII, with the contributions of the proposed residues to the enthalpic binding energy (DH) of inhibitor calculated using Discover. Additionally, the crystal structure of ALR2 containing Minalrestat (PDB code 1PWM) and ALR1 containing Fidarestat (PDB code 2AO0) were used to extract the contribution of the active-site residues towards inhibitor binding. All molecular modelling and energy calculations were carried out after water molecules that coincide with the modelled inhibitors were removed from the high-resolution crystal structures. Acknowledgements X-Ray data collection was undertaken on the 3-BM1 beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, Victoria; Australia.
