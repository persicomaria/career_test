ABSTRACT Crystal structures, forms 1 and 2, of recombinant native stromal cell-derived factor-1 a (SDF-1 a), expressed using the Sendai virus expression vector system, have been determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.0 Å resolution. The crystal of form 1 is almost isomorphous with that used in the previous crystal structure analysis of the synthetic [N33A] mutant of SDF-1a (Dealwis, C., et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1998;95, 6941­6946). However, the present structure analysis led to considerably better refinement statistics, revealing an error in the structural assignment of N-terminal residues in the previous report. Comparison of the solution structure, as previously determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the present structure, with two monomers in the asymmetric unit, reveals several local conformational differences. Alanine scan mutagenesis studies for each residue in the so-called RFFESH motif revealed that only the first residue, Arg12, is effective in enhancing receptor binding (and successive activation). A new notion that steric restraint between Arg8 and Arg12 is favorable (if not vital) for retaining SDF activities appears to explain more consistently the structure-activity relationship data accumulated to date. Four guiding principles are presented that may be useful for designing potent therapeutic compounds interfering with HIV-1 infection through competition at the CXCR4 coreceptor. INTRODUCTION
the CXC chemokines are more cell type specific and activate predominantly neutrophils or T lymphocytes. SDF-1 belongs to the CXC family, but it can attract various cell types, including resting lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD34 1 hematopoietic progenitor cells. The average sequence identity of SDF-1 with other human CXC chemokines and the CC chem okines is only 27% and 22%, respectively. Thus, the structural and functional relationships of SDF-1 to other chem okines have been enigm atic. Furthermore, SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 has been proven to be a coreceptor for T cell linetropic strains of human immunodefici ency virus type 1 (HIV1), (5,6 ) and SDF-1 was shown to block the entry of T cell line-tropic HIV-1 into cells. (7,8) Therefore, structural information about SDF-1 is also important for understanding HIV-1 in-

(SDF-1) is a proteinaceous factor involved in intercellular com munication processes, including B cell lymphopoiesis and bone marrow myelopoiesis, and belongs to the chem okine family. (1­3) Chemokines are divided into two classes according to the relative positions of the first two cysteine residues. In the first class, the CC chemokines, two cysteine residues are adjacent to each other, for example, RANTES and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In the other class, CXC chemokines, the two cysteine residues are separated by a single residue (X), (4) for example, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and growth-related protein (GRO). The CC chemokines promote the recruitm ent of various types of leukocytes, whereas

692 fection and treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The three-dimension al structure of SDF-1 in solution was first elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using the chemically synthesized material. (9) Analysis revealed that the basic structural framework of this unique chemokine is essentially the same as that of other chemokines, nam ely, IL-8, RANTES, and GRO. The comm on chemokinelike fold essentially consists of a three-stranded antiparallel b sheet to which a C-terminal short a -helix is obliquely attached. Subsequently, an independent crystal structure analysis was performed for the chemically synthesized [N33A] mutant of SDF-1a ,(10) one of the two forms of SDF-1, revealing essentially the same chain-folding topology. Meanwhile, in an independent crystallographic endeavor, we obtained two crystal forms of recombinant native SDF-1a expressed using a Sendai virus vector. One form was essentially isomorphous with that of the [N33A] mutant. However, detailed structure analysis of this crystal form through molecular replacement based on the structure of the [N33A] mutant resulted in significantly better refinem ent statistics at a slightly higher resolution, which provided a set of more reliable thermal parameters (the B factors) and revealed a necessity for correction in the structural assignment of the N-terminal polypeptide segment. Moreover, we have carried out a series of alanine scan mutagenesis studies on the so-called RFFESH motif of the molecule. The motif was deduced through various chimeric mutation analyses using various SDF-1/chem okine hybrids and has been implicated as an essential secondary binding site to the receptor molecule. (9 ) Surprisingly, our alanine scan studies clearly indicated that only the first R (arginine) residue, rather than the whole RFFESH segment, is essential for both chemoattractive activity and inhibition of HIV infection. This report on the new crystallographic and mutagenetic studies emphasizes only these points that are distinct from the previously reported results. A new notion that a steric restraint between Arg8 and Arg12 is favorable (if not vital) for retaining the SDF activities appears to explain the structure-activity relationship data accumulated thus far in a more com prehensive way. Four guiding principles, which may be useful for designing potent therapeutic compounds interfering with HIV-1 infection through competition at the CXCR4 coreceptor, are presented.

OHNISHI ET AL. mM sodium phosphate buffer on an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1­1 M NaCl in the same buffer. The fraction containing SDF-1 a was applied to an SP Sepharose HP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and SDF-1a was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.4­1 M NaCl.

Crystallization and data collection
Crystals of native SDF-1a were grown using the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. The droplets were prepared by mixing equal volumes of (1) the protein solution concentrated to 10 mg/ml using Ultrafree BioMax 5 K (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa and (2) the reservoir solution containing 1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M NaCl, and 100 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.0. The droplets were equilibrated with the reservoir solution. This crystallization condition led to two distinct crystal forms. Both crystal forms, which are referred to as forms 1 and 2, belonged to the orthorhombic space group, P2 1 2 1 2 1 , although the cell parameters were significantly different from each other. The cell parameters were a 5 38.9 Å, b 5 51.2 Å, and c 5 66.5 Å for the form 1 crystals and a 5 35.8 Å, b 5 58.7 Å, and c 5 73.4 Å for the form 2 crystals. Crystals of forms 1 and 2 diffracted up to 2.0 Å and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. All the diffraction data were collected at ambient tem perature using R-AXIS IIc area detector with CuK a radiation (generated by a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode x-ray generator operating at 4.95 kW). The statistics for the data collections are shown in Table 1.

Structure determination and refinement
The native form 1 crystal structure of SDF-1a was determined by the molecular replacement (MR) method using the program AMoRe.(14) The previously reported crystal structure of the [N33A] mutant of SDF-1a (PDB code 1a15) (10) was used as the search model. The flexible N-terminal region (residues 1­8) was removed from the search model. The cross-rotation function and the translation search gave an unambiguous solution. Subsequent rigid body refinement using the program AMoRe resulted in a crystallographic R factor of 28.6% at 3.0 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contained two subunits, hereafter referred to as subunit A and subunit B. The native form 2 crystal structure was also determ ined by the MR method. The crystal structure of form 1, residues 8­66, was used as the search model for MR. The obtained crystal structure reveals that the crystal packing of the form 2 crystal is distinct from that of form 1. Crystallographic refinements were carried out using the programs X-PLOR(15) and REFMAC. (16) In the course of the crystallographic refinement, free R factors (17) were used to assess the progress of the refinem ent (a 10% fraction of the total reflection data was randomly selected and exclusively used for calculating free R factors). One cycle of the crystallographic refinem ent consisted of one refinement procedure using XPLOR or REFMAC, followed by model building using the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The noncrystallographic two-fold symmetry restraints were applied at the initial stage of the refinement. After 11 cycles and 18 cycles of refinement for forms 1 and 2, respectively, the noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were removed. The bulk sol-

MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of recombinant SDF-1 a
Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were prepared as described previously (11) and maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). CEF were infected with a recombinant Sendai virus (SeV) expressing human SDF-1a , SeVSDF-1a ( 1 ),(12 ,13) at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 plaque-forming units (pfu) per cell and were maintained in MEM without serum. Culture supernatant was harvested 72 h after infection, and the SeV virions were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 3 g for 1 h at 4°C. The clarified supernatant was applied to a HiLoad 16/10 SP Sepharose FF column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Paris, France) equilibrated with 50

Analyses of obtained structure
The obtained crystal structure was analyzed using the program PROCHECK.(18) Secondary structures were determined based on the results of PROCHECK. Least-squares fittings of various molecular models of SDF-1a were carried out using the program LSQKAB in the CCP4 program suite. (16) For the leastsquares fittings, all the C a atoms between Pro10 and Lys64 were used. Solvent-accessib le surface area was calculated using the program s AREAIMOL and RESAREA in the CCP4 program suite. (16)

Anti-HIV-1 assay
MT4 cells (5 3 10 5 ) were incubated with various concentrations of SDF-1a or its mutants for 1 h and then exposed to 1000 50% tissue culture infective doses of the HIV-1 NL43 strain for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were washed twice with RPMI medium and maintained for 3 days in the RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Culture supernatants of the infected cells were assayed for the levels of p24 core antigen (Abbott, WiesbadenDelkenheim, Germany). The anti-HIV-1 activity of SDF-1a and its mutants was expressed as doses required for half-maximum inhibition.

Preparation of mutant SDF-1 a
Mutant SDF-1a genes were generated by site-directed mutagenesis by two successive PCR using NotI-tagged primer pairs. After digestion with NotI, the amplified fragments were directly introduced to the NotI site of pSeV18 1 b(1 ).(19) All PCR were perform ed with ExTaq polym erase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), and all the PCR products were verified for their sequence authenticity. Recombinant Sendai viruses were recovered from resulting plasmids essentially according to the previously described procedures. (19 ,20) The second passages in embryonated chicken eggs were used as the stock viruses for all the experiments. Mutant SDF-1a were purified from the culture supernatant of infected CEF as described.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystal isomorphism
Although compared with the lattice parameters of the previous [N33A] mutant crystals, those of the present form 1 native crystals are significantly larger by 0.2%, 1.4% , and 2.8% for the a, b, and c axes, respectively, the two crystals forms should be regarded as virtually isomorphous. The differences in lattice parameters may be due to protein mutation on one hand and differences in pH (7.0 in the present study vs. 8.5 in the previous study (10 )) and temperature (ambient temperature in the present study vs. 2 170°C with cryoprotectant in the previous study (10)) on the other.

Chemotaxis assay
Lymphocyte chemotaxis assays were performed according to the method described previously. (12) Briefly, human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained from healthy donors by the Ficoll-Histopa que method. Monocytes were removed by a 1-h step of plastic adherence. Cells (5 3 10 5 ) in 100 ml RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.25% human serum albumin (HSA) were added to the upper chamber of a 5-mm

Quality of refined structure of crystal form 1
The refinement statistics for the present native form 1 crystal structure (Table 1) are significantly better than those for the previous [N33A] mutant crystal structure. (1 0) This is partly due to the corrected assignment scheme for the N-terminal residues, and, as a result, a set of more reliable B factors has been ob-

694 tained. In contrast to the statistical values given in the previous report (10) (given in parentheses), the present structure has been refined at 2.0 Å (2.2 Å) resolution down to the R factor of 18.9% (22.5%) with the R free value of 25.8% (28.5%). The root mean-squares (rms) deviations from ideal geom etry are 0.007 Å (0.010 Å) and 1.4° (2.0°) for bond lengths and angles, respectively. Errors for the atomic coordinates were estim ated from the Luzzati plot, (21) indicating an upper error limit of 0.22 Å. The obtained crystal structure contains all the residues of the SDF-1a dimer except for the N-terminal five residues of subunit A and the N-terminal one residue of subunit B. The asymmetric unit contains 118 nonglycine and nonproline amino acid residues. Among these, 103 amino acid residues (87.3% ) have f ­ c angles in the "most favored" region of the Ramachandran plot. (2 2) Among the remaining 15 amino acid residues, 12 (10.2% in total) have dihedral angles in the "additional allowed" regions, and 2 (1.7%) have dihedral angles in the "generously allow ed" regions, whereas only 1 residue (Asn44B [Asn44 of subunit B]) has f ­c angles in the "disallowed" region. Reexaminatio n of the dihedral angles using a simulated annealing omit (SA omit) map (23) around Asn44B showed that the "disallowed" conform ation of the main chain was most probably a reality. Analyses of the main chain and side chain param eters by PROCHECK showed that all the parameters conform to the criteria of "Better" and "Inside" regions (data not shown). Thus, the geometry of the present crystal structure appears to be sufficiently reliable.

OHNISHI ET AL. the electron density representing the N-terminal part of subunit A was not observed. A less impressive refinement statistic associated with the previous crystal structure analysis may well be due to the misassignment mentioned. Moreover, we found that some of the geometric features associated with residues 3 and 4 as deduced from the deposited coordinates of the [N33A] mutant SDF-1a (PDB code 1a15) were unacceptable.

Other improvements in form 1 structure
By intensive crystallographic refinem ent of the form 1 structure, not only was the N-terminal part improved but also the remaining parts of the molecule were subjected to model improvem ents. First, the geom etry of disulfide bonds, especially bond lengths, was much improved. In the previous model, the average bond distance of S-S bonds was 2.37 Å, in contrast to the target value of 2.03 Å in the parameters of Engh and Huber, (25) whereas the present model exhibits a distance of 2.02 Å for the corresponding value. This geometric improvement is achieved through a careful model building of the loop region, residues 8­21, in the present study. Second, the conformations of several residues in the C-terminal were revised in both subunits of the crystallographic dimer.

Crystal structure refinement of form 2 structure
In addition to form 1, the crystal structure of form 2 has been determined by the MR method. The form 2 crystal was of rather poor quality, diffracting only up to 2.7 Å resolution. The crystallographic refinement at 2.7 Å resolution resulted in an R factor of 22.2% and a free R factor of 32.1%. Although the obtained R and free R factors are rather poor, the bond lengths and bond angles in the structure agree quite well with expected values (Table 1), and there are no outliers in the Ramachandran plot. In addition, a series of SA omit maps encompassing all the polypeptide chain of the form 2 structure has provided validity to the present structure. It should be noted that the average temperature factor for all the atoms in the form 2 structure is quite high, 64.6 Å 2 . This higher temperature factor compared with the form 1 structure appears to be caused by loose contacts with adjacent molecules in the form 2 crystal lattice, which is revealed by detailed analysis of the crystal packing. The detailed analyses of the crystal packing of the form 2 crystal has shown that residues involved in interaction with an adjacent molecule in the crystal lattice have relatively high tem perature factors, 70.3 Å 2 on average. This value is significantly higher than the average temperature factor for all the atoms in the asymm etric unit (64.6 Å 2 ). It is reasonable that the flexible nature of the residues involved in the crystal lattice formation would lead to a crystal of poor quality because of an imperfect lattice formation. This hypothesis could be supported by the fact that the corresponding value of the form 1 crystal (25.6 Å 2 ), the quality of which is much better than that of the form 2 crystal, is marginally smaller than the average temperature factor of all the atoms (26.4 Å 2 ). The form 2 structure, although of poor structural quality, seems to be useful to predict the flexibility of the molecule in solution.

Corrected assignment of N-terminal residues in form 1 structure
It has been established that in solution, the SDF-1 molecule is a monomer even at a concentration suitable for NMR measurem ent, which is much higher than the physiologic concentration. (9) In the present crystal forms, however, the two monom ers constituting an asymmetric unit are apparently tightly bound. As a result of such crystallographic dimerization, the SDF-1 molecule undergoes a series of rather extensive (although local) conformational changes, resulting in conformational differences among the crystallographic subunits A, B, and the monomer in solution. The NMR study by Crump et al.(9) also indicated that the N-terminal 8 residues did not assume fixed conformation in solution. In crystals, however, the conformation of the same N-term inal segm ent can be fixed through intermolecular interactions present in the crystal lattice. Moreover, the resultant fixed conformations can be different between the subunits A and B, as they are placed at distinct environments in the crystal lattice. The electron densities corresponding to the N-term inal segment of the form 1 structure were carefully interpreted (Fig. 1b), and we found that residues 1­4, which were assigned to subunit A 9 (Fig. 1a, upper right) in the previous report, (1 0) were better assigned to subunit B (Fig. 1a, lower right). Thus, our model for subunit B starts from Pro2 (rather than from Cys9, as in the previous study (10), and subunit A starts from Ser6 (rather than from Lys1). To confirm the validity of the present interpretation, an SA omit map (23) for the N-terminal 8 residues of the form 1 structure was calculated. The obtained SA omit map exhibited a continuous electron density encompassing the whole N-terminal part of subunit B of the present crystal structure (Fig. 1b), whereas

Overall structure of SDF-1 a

CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF SDF-1a

695 The monomer of SDF-1a has the conventional chemokine topology (28) consisting of three antiparallel b -strands (strands A, B, and C), which were folded in a Greek key-like arrangement to form a b -sheet, with an a -helix packed against the b -sheet. The (crystallographic) dimer is stabilized through a b sheet interaction between the mutually antiparallel strands A from the two subunits. Consequently, a six-stranded antiparallel b -sheet is form ed in the dimer. The N-terminal region of subunits B(1) and A(2) adopts extended conformations. These extended conformations are most probably crystallographic artifacts resulting from interactions with neighboring molecules, as the N-term inal segment is known to have a random conformation in solution. (9) The secondary structural elements of SDF-1a are designated as follows: strand A: residues 21A(1)­31A(1), 22B(1)­30B(1), 22A(2)­29A(2), and 22B(2)­30B(2); strand B: residues 35A (1)­43A(1), 37B(1)­43B(1), 37A(2)­43A(2), and 37B(2)­4 3B(2); strand C: residues 47­51 for all the subunits; helix D: residues 55A(1)­65A (1), 55B(1)­67B(1), 56A(2)­65A(2), and 55B(2)­64B(2). The differences in precise ranges of the residues in strands A and B, and helix D seem to be due to extensive conformational change of each subunit on forming the crystallographic dimer in the crystal lattice. In addition, there is a single turn of a 310 -helix (residues 19­21 for all the subunits) preceding strand A.

Flexibility of SDF-1 a molecule as assessed by temperature factor (B factor) and solvent-accessible surface area plots
As flexibility of SDF-1a and its cognate receptor molecules most probably plays a key role in its interaction with cells as envisaged by Crump et al. (see Fig. 7 of ref. 9), a relevant assessment based on fully refined coordinates and B factors may be worthwhile. The B factor and solvent-accessible surface area are plotted in Figure 3. The flexibility characteristics of a monomeric SDF-1a in solution may be deduced by carefully comparing the corresponding characteristics displayed by sub-

In the upper asymmetric unit, a dimer composed of subunit A 9 (named "first monomer" by Dealwis et al. (10) and subunit B 9 ("second monomer") as found in the previously determined [N33A] mutant crystal (10) is shown. In the lower asymmetric unit, another dimer composed of subunits A and B as found in the form 1 crystal (present study) is shown. Note the overlap of the (ghost) N-terminal tail of subunit A 9 over the real N-terminal tail of subunit B, explaining the origin of wrong assignment of the N-terminal segment.

The scheme of dimerization is essentially the sam e as that of IL-8, (26,27) which is one of the CXC chem okines. Hereafter, when specifying an amino acid residue of subunit A (or B), we attach a suffix A (or B) to the residue name (e.g., Arg12A). The crystal form is given in parentheses, Arg12A(2), if necessary. When no crystal form is given, it represents the residues of the form 1 structure.

696 units A and B of both crystal forms, each of which exhibits a distinct profile reflecting a different crystallographic environment surrounding these subunits. Furtherm ore, the B factor profile of the form 2 crystal is likely to reflect the flexibility of the molecule more precisely than that of the form 1 crystal because of the loose interaction between molecules in the crystal lattice. The B factor profiles of the b -strands A, B, and C in both the crystal forms are quite low, indicating that these regions are less flexible, whereas the profile of helix D seems to indicate that it is more flexible than the b -strands. The unusually low B factor profile (Fig. 3a) observed for the loop region interconnecting strands A and B (hereafter referred to as loop AB; loops BC and CD also exist) of subunit A(1) is most probably due to a low accessibility profile (Fig. 3b), which is due to crystal packing. Therefore, the much higher B factor profile exhibited by subunit B(1) than subunit A(1) perhaps reflects the intrinsic flexibility of loop AB in an isolated monomeric SDF-1a . The B factor profile for form 2 crystal (Fig. 3a) also strongly suggests the highly flexible nature of loop AB. Therefore, by careful analysis of the B factor profile and the solvent-accessibility profile, we may conclude the following (1) b -strands A, B, and C are remarkably less flexible than the other portion of the molecule. (2) Helix D seems to be more flexible than b strands. (3) Loops AB, BC, and CD are more flexible than the secondary structural elements. (4) Both the N-term inus, extending from residues 1 to 20 and the C-terminus are extremely flexible. (5) In monom er form , b -strand A might be more flexible than observed in the present structure because of the absence of interactions with the adjacent subunit in the crystallographic dimer.

OHNISHI ET AL. cule. Thus, the conformation of the loosened turn structure itself seems to be another stable conform ation of loop AB. It should be noted that a steric conflict between Leu36 and Ala65 of adjacent subunits in the crystallographic dimer appears to induce the above described multiple conformations on helix D and loop AB, which is not observed in solution structure. In subunit A(1), helix D undergoes a conformational change resulting in the kinked structure. On the other hand, in subunits B(1), A(2), and B(2), loop AB undergoes a conformational change. As the NMR structure is likely to be the most stable conformation in solution, the variety of structures of SDF-1a found in the present crystals might be adopted only when interacting with another molecule like its cognate receptor.

Mutagenesis studies on the so-called RFFESH motif of SDF-1 a
Based on a series of extensive mutagenesis studies on SDF1, Crump et al. (9) essentially arrived at the following conclusions. (1) All the 8 N-terminal residues preceding the CXC motif (Cys9-X10-C ys11) take part (in the sense that each of their mutations causes certain effects) in receptor binding, but only Lys1 and Pro2 are directly involved in receptor activation (rather than mere binding), as assessed by induction of intracellular free calcium. (2) The 6 residues following the CXC motif, Arg12­Phe13­Phe14­Glu15­Ser16­His17, as a whole are referred to as the RFFESH motif and are considered to be very important for receptor binding and activation. The absence of this motif (as realized through the form ation of relevant chimeras) decreases potency for receptor binding and activation, and its restoration dram atically restores both receptor binding and activation. On the basis of this observation, Crump et al.(9) proposed two sites to be receptor binding sites in SDF-1. Site 1 is the RFFESH motif, and site 2 is the N-terminal 8 residues. Furtherm ore, by analogy with other chemokines, they proposed the following mechanisms. (1) Initially, site 1 binds the receptor surface. (2) The resultant conformational changes facilitate the second binding step involving site 2. (3) Finally, the binding of the N-terminal 2 residues in site 2 triggers receptor activation. It should be noted that chimera experiments, the so-called RFFESH motif was always treated as a whole, reflecting the nature of the employed approach using various SDF1/chemokine chimeras. (9) Aiming at clarifying the functional role of each residue, we carried out a series of alanine scan experiments on the RFFESH motif (Table 3). In these experiments, the activity of various mutants was evaluated in terms of chemotactic activity and anti-HIV-1 activity. As has been well established, SDF-1 acts both as an agonist, causing receptor activation, and as an antagonist, causing inhibition of HIV infection through competitively stronger receptor binding. Surprisingly, among a series of single mutations to alanine applied to 6 consecutive residues in the RFFESH motif, only the one applied to Arg12 exhibited a significant effect (, 17-fold decrease in anti-HIV-1 activity and , 12-fold decrease in chemotactic activity). Simultaneous conversion of all the residues belonging to the RFFESH motif to alanine resulted in , 11-fold decrease in chemotactic activity (Table 3). Thus, we are forced to conclude that only Arg12, rather than the whole RFFESH motif, is significantly related to receptor binding and

Comparison of crystal and solution structures
The solution structure is deduced by NMR spectroscopy (9) and the crystal structures of forms 1 and 2 crystals as revealed in the present study are superimposed in Figure 4. This was done by optimizing the overlap of the C a atoms for residues 10­64. The obtained rms deviations are given in Table 2. Apart from the wild deviation in the N-terminal 7 residues, one notes considerable conformational variability in loops AB, CD, and helix D, all of which intriguingly correspond to the region of high flexibility as described in the previous section. The striking difference between the crystal and solution structures exists in the relative disposition of helix D. The axis of helix D is roughly perpendicular to the axes of the b -strands in crystal, whereas it is bent by about 15° toward the axes of the b -strands in solutions (Fig. 4). Model building studies indicate that the latter orientation of helix D would disturb the dimeric packing scheme observed in the crystal. Thus, the orientation of helix D may have been altered during the dimeric packing procedure in crystallization. Multiple conformation is also observed in loop AB, which can be categorized into two groups. One is the 4-turn structure (29) or a closely related one, which was observed in subunit A(1) and in the solution structure among which the former turn is a more typical 4-turn. The other group is a rather loosened turn structure, which was observed in subunits B(1), A(2), and B(2). The loosened turn region, residues 31­36, is located at the periphery of the SDF-1a dimer and is not involved in direct interaction with the remaining part of the dimeric mole-

and 1040, respectively. Considering the full length of the SDF1 molecule (67 residues), the remaining activity is surprisingly large for the lengths of these fragments. One intriguing observation was that the dimeric SDF-1[1­9] (2 [1­9] fragments connected through the Cys9­Cys9 9 disulfide bridge) retained a surprisingly high level of activity, weakened by factors of only 82

Enhanced interpretation of results of previous structure-activity relationship studies
Crump et al.(9) prepared various truncated mutants of SDF1 lacking 1­8 N-term inal residues, namely the SDF-1[2­67] through SDF-1[9­67] mutants. Deletion of the N-terminal 2 residues (Lys1 and Pro2) affects the receptor binding only moderately but dramatically spoils the receptor activation (as assessed by intracellular calcium induction). Further deletion of the N-terminal residues (Val3 to Tyr7) weakens the receptor binding activity by a factor of , 10­100 (with undetectable receptor activation). Ultimately, the deletion of the N-terminal 8 residues from SDF-1 (SDF-1[9­67]) exhibits no detectable activity for receptor binding (and activation), indicating that the presence of Arg8 is essential for receptor binding. Later, the same group (30) further discovered that unlike other chemokines, some of the N-terminal fragments retain receptor binding and activation (as assessed by chemoattractant activity), although they are much less potent. Thus, for the SDF1[1­17] and [1­9] fragments, receptor binding activity was retained but was weakened by a factor of 94 and 1500 as com pared with the intact SDF-1, respectively, and receptor activation was also retained although weakened by a factor of 440 T A BLE 2.

FIG. 5. One of the energy-minimized structures in stereo for the (a) Arg8-Arg12 segment in SDF-1 and (b) Arg8-Arg8 9 segment in synthetic SDF-1[1­9] dimer. In the latter, two [1­9] fragments are connected through a Cys9­Cys9 9 disulfide bridge. Note that the S-S distance (2.0 Å) is roughly comparable to the N(H)-C a -C(5 O) distance (2.5 Å). In a, two artificial modifications were made: a standard all trans Arg side chain was attached to C a of Arg8, as the side chain was not visible in the electron density map, and the side chain of Arg12, which assumed a partly folded conformation in the crystal structure, was replaced by a standard all-trans side chain for the convenience of comparison with the side chain of Arg8 9 displayed in b. This diagram demonstrates that the steric arrangement of the two arginine side chains can be very similar between the cases a and b.

CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF SDF-1a and 100 for receptor binding and activation, respectively. We found that these results could be better interpreted on the basis of the new finding that only Arg12, among the RFFESH residues, as well as the N-terminal residues, is essential for such activities. Our enhanced interpretation is essentially based on the following four notions. (1) The presence of the N-terminal 2 residues (Lys1 and Pro2) is a necessary (although not sufficient) feature for receptor activation (and binding). (2) The presence of each of the following 5 residues (Val3 to Tyr7) is a favorable (although not necessary) feature for receptor binding (and for enhancing receptor activation). (3) The presence of Arg8 is a necessary (although not sufficient) feature for receptor binding. (4) The presence of Arg12 is another favorable (although not necessary) feature for receptor binding (and for enhancing receptor activation). The first three notions are based on the previous observation, (9,30) whereas the last is based on our new experiment described in the preceding section. First, we note that among the 12 CXC chemokines (see Fig. 1 of ref. 31), only SDF-1 has a proline residue (Pro10) as the X residue in the CXC motif. Second, the residue immediately preceding the CXC motif is almost always conserved to arginine (Arg8 in SDF-1), with only one exception (glutamine in PF4). Third, the residue immediately following the CXC motif is conserved to a (valine, leucine, isoleucine) family with only one exception, Arg12 in SDF-1. In view of the fourth described above, it would be worthwhile to estimate the extent of steric constraint between the residue (Arg8) immediately preceding CXC and that immediately succeeding CXC (Arg12 in SDF1). As proline is well known for its remarkable effect on restraining the backbone conformation (see, e.g., ref. 32), the presence of a proline as the X residue in the CXC motif would remarkably enhance the steric constraint between the residues Arg8 and Arg12. Given that the X residue is a proline only in SDF-1, the chemokine SDF-1 must be in an exceptionally favorable condition for retaining its activity even when fragmented around the CXC motif. This may well explain why unlike other chemokines, such a small fragment as SDF-1[1­17] retains considerable receptor binding and activation activities in the case of SDF-1.(3 0) Perhaps in other chemokines having amino acid residues other than proline at the X position, the presence of the main body of the chemokine is needed to constrain the CXC conformation through two disulfide bridges emanating from the first and second cysteine residues in the CXC motif, the (9­34) and (11­50) disulfide bridges, respectively, in SDF-1 (Fig. 2). If one accepts the hypothesis that the specifically stronger geometric constraint imposed between Arg8 and Arg12 (through the proline-containing CXC motif) is a special merit of SDF-1 for retaining chemokine activity, one can easily explain the intriguing observation made by Loetscher et al. (30) that the SDF-1[1­9] dimer exhibits receptor binding and activation even stronger than the SDF[1­17] fragment (see Table I of ref. 30). As shown in Figure 5, the distance between the side chains Arg8 and Arg12 in native SDF-1 (Fig. 5a) can be almost com parable to that between the side chains of Arg8 and the counterpart of Arg8 (denoted as Arg8 9 ) in the second peptide (Fig. 5b). Here it should be noted that a disulfide bridge is also known for its ability to confer relatively stronger geometric constraints to the surrounding residues. (32) Finally, it should be recalled

699 that in the case of SDF-1, even the single chain SDF-1[1­9] or SDF-1[1­8] mutant still retains chemotactic activity, although much less potently. (30) This means that the fourth notion concerning the steric constraint between Arg8 and Arg12 is only a favorable, rather than a necessary, condition for retaining SDF1 activities. Clearly, more series of structure-activity relationship studies of SDF-1 are necessary. Crystal structure elucidation of a com plex between SDF-1 and at least a fragment of its receptor (CXCR4) should be focus of future study. Given another function of CXCR4 as a coreceptor for HIV-1 infection, accumulation of such knowledge on the structure and function of SDF1 will greatly facilitate designing potent therapeutic compounds for treating AIDS.
