The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein enhances virus particle release from infected cells, decreases the tendency of syncytia formation and induces degradation of human CD4 receptor. It is known that the cytoplasmic part of Vpu is responsible for direct interaction to and degradation of CD4. The tertiary fold of the Vpu cytoplasmic domain in aqueous solution was determined employing NMR spectroscopy and molecular-dynamics simulated-annealing protocols. We found a very well defined amphipathic a-helix in the membrane proximal part (40-50), a less well defined helix (60-68), and a short a-helix at the C-terminus (75-79). We further determined the overall tertiary structure based on long-range nuclear Overhauser enhancement effects. Correlation of results from mutation experiments of Vpu and the structure data is discussed.

Keywords: human immunodeficiency virus 1 Vpu; NMR; solution structure; CD4; lysin.

Vpu is a 81-amino-acid transmembrane protein that is known to be encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-I) and the simian immunodeficiency virus strain SIV,,,. Recently, however, a Vpu-like activity has been reported for HIV-2 (Bour et al., 1996). Vpu is not essential for virus replication, but enhances virus particle release from infected cells, decreases syncytia formation, and leads to degradation of CD4 receptor molecules (Schubert and Strebel, 1994). A cation channel activity is also observed for Vpu (Ewart et al., 1996). Vpu can be divided into three different sequence regions (Fig. 1A). A short stretch of basic amino acid residues connects the putative transmembrane part and the extremely acidic cytoplasmic domain. This kind of short basic amino acid sequence is known to be important for anchoring in the phospholipid bilayer and hence should not be counted as belonging to the cytoplasmic domain in general (Yeagle, 1993). The N-terminal 32 residues were found to be sufficient for the virus particle release activity of Vpu. The sequence of the transmembrane part, however, is not important for CD4-degi-adation activity of Vpu. Only the presence of a transmembrane part as such seems to be important for this activity (Schubert et al., 1996). A multiple-sequence alignment of all known HIV-1 Vpu sequences reveals overall high conservation (Fig. 1B). Alignment

of the SIV,,, and all HIV-1 Vpu sequences reduces the regions of high conservation to residues 48-59. This is the region around two serines, which are phosphorylated by casein kinase I1 (CK2; Schubert et al., 1994). Phosphorylation of Ser53 and Ser57 is not essential for binding of Vpu to CD4, but is necessary for degradation of the latter (Schubert and Strebel, 1994; Vincent and Jabbar, 1995). Activities related to enhanced virus particle release and CD4 degradation could be separately assigned to the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic part of the protein, respectively (Schubert et a]., 1996). Residues important for direct interaction with CD4 were mapped by a mutational study (Margottin et al., 1996) using a yeast two hybrid system. It was found that C-terminal residues and conservation of the putative membrane-proximal arnphipathic helix are important for CD4-binding activity of Vpu. The published data show the cytoplasmic domain of HIV-1 Vpu to bind directly to part of the cytoplasmic domain of the CD4 receptor (402-420; Bour et al., 1995a,b). Both, the Vpu cytoplasmic domain and CD4(402-420) are small and thus are very well suited as model systems for studying protein-protein interactions by NMR. The structure of Vpu cytoplasmic domain and the structure of CD4(403-419) (Willbold and Rosch, 1996) may serve as a basis for further structural studies of the complex formed by these components. Wray et al. (1995) structurally investigated several synthetic peptides resembling short, overlapping parts of the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu in a 50% (by vol.) trifluoroethanol solution. They found helices in the sequence regions 42-50 and 57-69, as well as a turn from 74-77. Trifluoroethanol is known to stabilize regular secondary-structure elements with the overall tendency to favor the formation of a-helices (Sonnichsen et al., 1992). Trifluoroethanol also weakens tertiary structures stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Klaus et al., 1991 ; Alexandrescu et al., 1994; Sticht et al., 1994; Marx et al., 1995). In the present study we therefore investigated the structure of the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu in trifluoroethanol-free, aqueous so-

Asterisks mark identical residues, points mark similar residues among Vpu sequences. Alignment was done for Vpu amino acid sequences only for HIV-1 htrains separately and for HTV-1 and SIV strains together (last line). Sequences were obtained from the SwissProt data bank. The sequence numbers correspond to the sequence of VPU-HVISI, which was investigated in the present work.

et al., 1984), and clean total coherence spectroscopy (cleanTOCSY; Griesinger et al., 1988) with a spin lock field of about 12 kHz. The spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode with quadrature detection in both dimensions using the timeproportional-phase-incrementation technique (TPPI ; Marion and Wuthrich, 1983). Solvent suppression was performed by continuous coherent irradiation prior to the first excitation pulse and during the mixing time in the NOESY experiment. To obtain optimal signal resolution, temperature and salt concentration of the sample was varied. On the basis of these experiments, spectra recorded at 298 K without additional salt and 277 K in the presence of 500 mM Na,SO, were evaluated for further analysis. Acquisition and processing parameters. Typical spectral parameters were, frequency width, 6024 Hz; data matrix size, 4 kX512 data points; application of sinebell squared filter with a phase shift of n/3 for the NOESY and clean-TOCSY experiments as well as a sinebell filter with a phase shift of n/16 for the DQF-COSY experiment. After zero filling and Fourier transformation 4 kX2 k data points were obtained. Processing, evaluation and imaging of the NMR data were performed with the NDEE software package (Herrmann; 1995). Structure calculation. Distance information was extracted from NOESY spectra with mixing times of 100, 150 and 200 ms. The structures were calculated from the NMR data according to the standard X-PLOR ab initio simulated annealing and refinement protocols (Briinger, 1993). NOE cross-peaks were grouped according to their intensity into three categories : strong (0.18-0.32 nm), medium (0.18-0.40 nm), and weak (0.18-0.55 nm). Starting from an extended template structure, 50 energy-minimization steps were used, followed by 100 ps molecular dynamics at 1000 K with a soft square NOE energy term (asymptote 0.1) and 50 ps molecular dynamics at 1000 K with increased weight on geometry and tilted asymptote (1.0) for the NOE energy term, cooling to 300 K in 50 K steps and 200 steps of minimization. The structures from the simulatedannealing procedures were subjected to molecular-dynamics simulated-annealing refinement. The resulting 25 structures were screened for those showing no NOE distance violation exceeding 0.05 nm and having an NOE effective energy term lower than 190 kJ/mol. Nine structures fulfilled these criteria and were used for further analysis. Secondary-structure-based database alignment. The program TOPITS was used for a search for proteins that show sequence similarities with Vpu based on secondary structure and surface accessibility (Rost, 1995).

RESULTS
Correctness of the synthetic gene coding for poly-histidinetagged Vpucyt fusion protein was shown by DNA sequence analysis. Expression of Vpucyt yielded about 10 mg protein/l medium after all purification and processing steps. The product was more than 95 % pure as judged from denaturing PAGE. Further, the molecular mass of Vpucyt was verified by MALDITOF mass spectrometry and was determined to be 5109 U, which is close to the theoretical value of 5 107 U. Secondary-structure predictions for Vpu based on several algorithms yielded differing results. The putative transmembrane helix is predicted by the PhD network, which usually has 95% accuracy in this respect (Rost et al., 1995). Secondary-structure prediction (Rost and Sander, 1993) by the PhD network agrees with transmembrane helix prediction. GOR (Gibrat et al., 1987) and CF (Chou and Fasman, 1974) methods, however, do not predict a helix in the putative transmembrane part. Focusing on

the cytoplasmic part of Vpu, all three methods agree in predicting an a-helix for residues 61 -70. CF and PhD also predict an a-helix for residues 38-51. Only CF predicts a helix at the very C-terminal part, residues 73-81. Two-dimensional NMR-spectra (clean-TOCSY, NOESY, DQF-COSY) of a 5.4 mM Vpucyt solution at pH 7.0, phosphate, showed satisfactory resolution. By evaluating through-bond connectivities in DQF-COSY and clean-TOCSY spectra, it was possible to identify all spin systems of Vpucyt. All resonances could be assigned sequence specifically based mainly on the mainchain-directed approach (Englander and Wand, 1987; Fig. 2). The NOESY cross-peak pattern (Fig. 3) indicates helix-type [d,,j(i,i+3)] NOES with medium or high intensity for residues 40-51, 53-56, 62-68 and 75-79. From that it can be expected that regular a-helices exist in those regions. Scalar 'J,,,< coupling constants could not be determined due to the high line width and, thus, residues 53-56 may form either a helix or a turn structure. In addition to short-range and medium-range NOES, some unambiguous long range NOES could be also assigned (Table 2). All distance constraints were obtained from NOESY spectra recorded under low-salt conditions and ambient temperature (298 K), as well as high-salt conditions and low temperature (277 K). For ab initio simulated annealing and refinement, molecular dynamics calculations with distance constraints obtained from NOESY spectra with mixing times of 100 ms and 150 ms were used. Simulated annealing and refinement calculations based on experimental data and ideal geometry yielded 25 structures, which were screened for those showing no NOE distance violation exceeding 0.05 nm and having an NOE effective energy term lower than 190 kJ/mol.

Shown is the plot of the q5 and ty angles for the residues of the average structure of the nine obtained Vpu cytoplasmic domain structures. Open and closed circles mark glycine and non-glycine residues, respectively. The only residues (65, 68, 72), that are not in or close to the most favourable regions of allowed +-ty-angle combinations for non-glycine residues, belong to the worst defined region of the protein (Fig. 7) and arise from averaging of not necessarily unfavouable angles.

tures are summarized in Table 1. The rmsd value of 0.16 nm for the entire protein backbone shows the overall structure to be fairly well defined. All calculated structures show overall helical character (Fig. 4). Analysis with the DSSP program (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) revealed the presence of regular a-helices for residues 40-50, 52-55, 60-63 and 75-79 in at least 67% of the obtained structures (Fig. 5). Although residues 64-68 were not recognized as regular a-helix by DSSP, this sequence shows helical character (Fig. 6). The global fold is governed by a long, well defined N-terminal a-helix (helix-1), followed by a loop region (loop-1) and a less well defined antiparallel a-helix (helix-2). The subsequent strand (loop-2) ends with a short C-terminal a-helix (helix-3) and folds back to the preceding two helices (Fig. 6). Helix-1 is an ideally amphipathic helix. Along the helix axis the cylinder consists of one third hydrophobic, one third arginine, and one

third acidic residues. Loop-1 may contain an additional helix turn, that, however, can hardly be distinguished from a turn type structure. In either case, Ser53 and Ser57, which are thought to be phosphorylated by casein kinase I1 (Schubert et al., 1992), are aligned in close proximity at the surface of the protein. All residues of loop-1 are strictly conserved among all known Vpu amino acid sequences (Fig. 1). Helix-2 and loop-2 cannot be clearly delimited from the calculated structures and comprise the part of the sequence that shows the highest degree of variation. Helix-3, again, consists of residues highly conserved among all HIV-1 Vpu sequences. Helix-2 and loop-2 contain those residues that show the highest rmsd value of their backbone coordinates (Fig. 7), which is not surprising since no long-range NOE distance constraint could be found involving residues of this sequence region. Another interesting feature of the structure is the solvent exposition of the aromatic residues His72 and Trp76. The charges of the 14 aspartic and glutamic acid residues can only be partially compensated by the four arginine residues of Vpucyt. Thus, Vpucyt is very acidic, and the negative electrostatic potential dominates the peptide surface completely. The overall negative potential is surrounded by only a few spots with positive potential arising from the four arginine residues and

structure (Rost, 1995). Additional data used for input were residual surface accessibility, and the predicted transmembrane helix for the N-terminal part of Vpu not investigated in this work. Lysin from red abalone (Huliotis rufescens) was found to be the best scoring protein.

DISCUSSION
For evaluation of relative intensities of sequential HCa-HN NOES compared with HN-HN NOEs (Fig. 3) it is important to keep in mind that under the employed NMR measurement conditions (pH 7, water presaturation by continous irradiation) protein amide protons exchange very rapidly, leading to a decreased intensity of all amide-proton-related cross-peaks, especially of those involving two amide protons. Presence of helix-type NOEs (i,i+3 and i,i+4) is indicative for a-helical secondary structure of residues 40-SO and some short helical stretches from 5255, 60-68 and 75-79. This supports the results obtained by Wray et al. (1995) who found two a-helical regions from 4351 and 58-69, as well as a turn from 74-77 (numbering as in Fig. 1) in small peptide fragments of Vpu in trifluoroethanolcontaining solution. Helix-I is even longer in trifluoroethanolfree solution. The long second helix found by Wray et al. (1995) was found to be slightly shorter in trifluoroethanol-free solution. DSSP recognizes regular a-helical secondary structure for residues 60-63, but the following residues also show helical structure up to residue 68. The turn found by Wray et al. (1995) is difficult to distinguish by NMR methods from a short helix as found by us for residues 75-79. Overall, the secondary structures found in trifluoroethanol-containing and trifluoroethanolfree solutions are very similar. However, in aqueous solution it was possible to detect tertiary-stl-ucture-definingNOEs in the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu. The tertiary fold is determined by ten long-range distance constraints, and the obtained structures from simulated-annealing and refinement calculations show an overall rmsd value of only 0.16 nm. Examples of well-determined tertiary folds from a small number of distance constraints are known (Willbold et al., 1994; Aszodi et al., 1995; Bayer et a]., 199.5)., The amino acid residues connecting the first helix with the third one, that is antiparallel to the first helix, are the most conserved ones in the multiple sequence alignment of Vpu proteins (Fig. 1). These residues also contain the two phosphorylation sites (Ser.53 and Ser57) that are necessary for CD4 downregula-

tion. These residues may thus form a contact surface for interactions with host factors. The membrane proximal part of the cytoplasmic domain of human CD4 receptor forms an amphipathic helix (Willbold and Rosch, 1996) that carries an overall charge opposite to the charge of the N-terminal a-helix in Vpu cytoplasmic domain. Whether these charge distributions provide a recognition mechanism between the two proteins is currently under investigation. The mechanism of Vpu's activities and the host factors involved are unknown. Thus, any additional information is valuable. Sequence-similarity searches in sequence data banks did not yield clear results, but a secondary structure based alignment yielded lysin from red abalone (H. rufescens) as the best candidate. In vivo, lysin creates a hole in the vitelline envelope of the egg, permitting the sperm to pass through the envelope and fuse with the egg. I n vitro, it releases entrapped carboxyfluorescein from neutral liposomes, and it fuses negatively charged liposomes. The structure of lysin (Shaw et al., 1993) exhibits two features important for comparison with Vpu: two tracks of basic residues that span the length of the molecule, and a solvent exposed cluster of aromatic and aliphatic amino acids. In all obtained structures of Vpu cytoplasmic domain, the only aromatic side chains, His72 and Trp76, are totally exposed to the solvent. I n the case of Trp76, this could be confirmed by the fluorescense emission maximimum of Vpucyt being 3.50 nm (data not shown). An alignment of Vpu with residues 26-123 of lysin shows no striking similarity at the amino-acid-sequence level (23 % identity and 48% similarity), but still cannot be discounted (Fig. 8). All but four of the residues that are similar in lysin and Vpu are conserved among HIV-1 Vpu proteins. It is interesting to note that an ion channel activity of Vpu has been suggested (Ewart et al., 1996).

Although only a part of Vpu was investigated in the presented work, the obtained tertiary fold certainly is relevant. The cytoplasmic part of Vpu is responsible and sufficient (in combination with any other, heterologous transmembrane part) for one of the Vpu activities, namely direct binding to and degradation of human CD4 receptor (Schubert et al., 1996). If the N-terminal part of Vpu is a membrane-spanning helix, one can anticipate that it is not involved in the tertiary structure of the cytoplasmic part of the protein and hence its absence does not have dramatic influence. However, the part of lysin which would be analogous to the N-terminal, putative transmembrane part of Vpu is part of the globular structure of lysin (Shaw et al., 1993). This leads to two possibilities. First, the putative transmembrane part of Vpu is not necessarily a transmembrane part during all stages of Vpu action. Second, Vpu and lysin can exist in two different conformations depending on whether inserted into a membrane or not. From the present tertiary structure it is obvious, that the most conserved region on an amino acid sequence level, Glu48Ser57, is exposed in a loop connecting two helices. Deletion of amino acids in this region recults in loss of CD4-degradation activity (Chen et al., 1993). The C-terminus with the HIV-1 Vpu consensus sequence WDIDDL81 is close in space to this loop. Deletion of the six C-terminal residues of Vpu (Chen et al., 1993) or even mutation of Asp77 (Margottin et al., 1996), which is completely conserved among all HIV-1 Vpu sequences, also leads to loss of CD4-binding activity. The importance of the amphipathic helix-I for binding of Vpu to CD4 is underlined by the finding that Leu42Phe variation does not affect CD4-binding activity, but Ile47Lys does. Deletion of residues 29-48 also abolishes CD4-binding activity (Margottin et al., 1996). Thus, although the global tertiary fold of the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu as described here is based only on a few long-range NOES, it serves as a good framework for the explanation of results from mutational experiments on a structural level.
