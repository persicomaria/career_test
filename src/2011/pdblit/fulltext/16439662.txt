changes, possibly generated by human activity? Recent changes in weather patterns and a wide variety of anthropogenic effects (24, 25), along with losses of pollinators and herbivores from all tropical ecosystems (26), may have contributed to a reduced diversity of recruits in all these FDPs. Such effects cannot be ruled out, but the increase in diversity observed from seeds to seedlings at BCI (23) and the low diversity of trees that died during the census interval at all the FDPs in the current study indicate that the changes in diversity reported here have largely been the result of ongoing natural processes. It remains to be discovered, however, what fraction of these increases in local diversity can be attributed to JanzenConnell effects, to the ability of rare tree species to take advantage of a complex local environment, and to positive interactions among rare tree species themselves. Thorough testing of these possibilities may require experimental manipulation of small areas within mature tropical forests through the deliberate introduction of large numbers of seeds or seedlings of a variety of common or rare species followed by a detailed examination of the fate of these introductions over time. The nonrandom maintenance of diversity has two consequences, one short term and one longer term. In the short term, ecosystems that have lost diversity after temporary damage may be able to recover their former diversity levels rapidly, provided that any extinctions that have taken place in the affected ecosystems are local and diversity can be restored through immigration. Such a rapid recovery in diversity would not be possible if individuals of different species replaced each other at random (4). In the longer term, natural selection will tend to increase morphological and biochemical differences among host species (27, 28). In the case of Janzen-Connell effects, these differences will be selected because they result in pathogen range restriction. This restriction will in turn increase the effectiveness of frequencydependent selection for host species that are rare, because their pathogens will also be rare (29). In the case of niche complementarity and facilitation, differences between tree species will increase over time because these differences will aid the efficient utilization of different physical environments or will increase the benefit of interspecific interactions. Thus, the evolutionary result of frequency-dependent mechanisms for the maintenance of ecosystem diversity will be the generation of further diversity among the species of each trophic level.

An Architectural Framework That May Lie at the Core of the Postsynaptic Density

Bowie1* The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a complex assembly of proteins associated with the postsynaptic membrane that organizes neurotransmitter receptors, signaling pathways, and regulatory elements within a cytoskeletal matrix. Here we show that the sterile alpha motif domain of rat Shank3/ProSAP2, a master scaffolding protein located deep within the PSD, can form large sheets composed of helical fibers stacked side by side. Zn2þ, which is found in high concentrations in the PSD, binds tightly to Shank3 and may regulate assembly. Sheets of the Shank protein could form a platform for the construction of the PSD complex.

A number of scaffolding proteins link components of the PSD (10). The Shank family of proteins (also known as ProSAP, SSTRIP, CortBP, Synamon, or Spank) are considered master scaffolding proteins in the PSD, because they bind to a number of other scaffolding proteins including guanylate kinase­associated protein/SAP90/ PSD-95­associated proteins (GKAP/SAPAPs),

a-fodrin, Homer, Cortactin, and Abp-1 (11­14). Shank proteins are located deep within the PSD, wedged between scaffolding proteins that are bound to either neurotransmitter receptors or the actin cytoskeleton (15, 16). They are therefore well positioned to nucleate the underlying structure of the PSD. Moreover, Shank3 expression increases the number and size of synaptic contacts in induced dendritic spines, which suggests that it plays a fundamental role in organizing the PSD (17). Among the conserved domains of Shank, a likely candidate for generating a higher order structure is the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which in some cases is known to form a polymer through self-association (18­21). The SAM domain of Shank is also known to self-associate (22) and is required for the localization of Shank2 and Shank3 to the PSD (23). Examination of purified rat Shank3 SAM domains by electron microscopy (EM) revealed large sheets of parallel fibers (Fig. 1A). Each fiber is approximately 70 ) in diameter and has a striated surface suggesting a helical structure, similar to other SAM polymers. In contrast to other SAM polymers, however, over 25 fibers could be seen to stack tightly side by side in a highly ordered array (Fig. 1B). To learn in more detail how this sheet was constructed, we sought a high-resolution structure but were stymied by the poor solubility and heterogeneous assembly of Shank-SAM. To improve solubility, we changed 10 potential surface hydrophobic residues to Glu one at a time. Four of the mutants EW5E (where Trp5 is replaced by Glu), S6E, V52E, and M56E^ (24) increased solubility, and we were able to crystallize and solve the structure of M56E at 2.1 ) (25). Shank-SAM forms polymeric fibers in the crystal structure, which was previously seen with other SAM domains (Fig. 1C). The individual fibers form a lefthanded helix with six subunits per turn, a pitch of È40 ), and a width of È70 ), consistent with the EM images. The M56E mutation is in the intrapolymer interface, where it can disrupt polymerization and solubilize the protein, but sufficient binding affinity remains to drive recreation of this interface in the crystal. The fibers in the crystal structure also stack side by side in a manner that closely resembles the EM images (compare Fig. 1, B and C). Although SAM domains are known to form helical polymers very much like the individual fibers of Shank-SAM, side-by-side packing of these fibers into a sheet has not been observed before. Polymeric fibers often associate, but the formation of a flat sheet like we see for Shank-SAM is an improbable organization, suggesting that the sheet structure is a design feature of the protein. Moreover, two of the mutations (W5E and S6E) that effectively solubilize the protein are found only in the interfiber interface, suggesting that inter- and intrafiber assembly occur in concert. To further test the requirement for cooperative assembly, we generated a series of 18 mutations that we predicted, based on the structure, might destabilize either intra- or interfiber interfaces, and we analyzed their aggregation behavior by gel filtration chromatography (25). On the basis of their elution profiles, the mutants were classified as perfect monomers (M), partially monomeric (PM), or aggregates (A). Of the 18 mutants, we obtained 6 M mutants (W5E, S6E, F8E, L47E, V52E, and M56E), 4 PM mutants (L4A, H22A, L36E, and V45E), and 8 A mutants (L2E, E21A, R23A, I31E, L39A, D43R, H54A, and L65E) (24). As shown in Fig. 2, A to C, the side chains of the 6 M mutants are involved in creating both the interfiber and intrafiber interaction surfaces. Three of the M mutants (L47E, V52E, and M56E) and one of the PM mutants (V45E) occur in the intrafiber interface (Fig. 2B), whereas the other three M mutants (W5E, S6E, and F8E) and one PM mutant (L4A) are in the interfiber interface (Fig. 2C). The remaining two PM mutants (H22A and L36E) are not directly in the interface. L36 is 100% buried, and the mutation is likely to distort the structure; whereas H22 is a ligand to the Zn2þ site, which provides additional stability to the sheet (discussed below). The ability of single-point mutations in either inter-

(B) At higher magnification, the well-ordered nature of the sheet can be seen as individual subunits that are arranged in a highly ordered array. (C) The packing of Shank-SAM into a sheet is also evident in the ° crystal structure of Shank-SAM M56E (a soluble mutant) solved to 2.1 A. Yellow and blue depict fibers stacked in opposite orientations. Both the antiparallel and parallel orientations are seen in the crystal, but we believe the antiparallel orientation is physiologically relevant for several reasons. First, the interfiber interface buries more surface area in the antiparallel orientation (1264 ° ° A2 versus 852 A2). Second, the position of a mutation that solubilizes the protein (W5E) is in the interface between antiparallel fibers (Fig. 2C) but not parallel fibers. Finally, Zn2þ, which has a dramatic effect on sheet organization, stabilizes salt bridges between antiparallel fibers but not parallel fibers (Fig. 3C). In the numbering scheme used for the crystal structure, residue 1 corresponds to residue 174 in the full rat Shank3 sequence.

face to prevent the formation of the sheet strongly suggests that stable assembly requires favorable interactions both within and between the fibers. Is the observed sheet assembly compatible with the full-length protein? The SAM domain is at the C terminus of a large, 1806-residue protein, raising a question of whether the helical SAM polymers could associate into a sheet with such a huge protein arrayed in a radial fashion on the outside. Examination of the crystal structure indicates that all the N termini can escape steric clash. To test experimentally whether the sheet structure could accommodate a large protein at the N terminus, we constructed a fusion protein, called MBP-Shank, composed of a maltose binding protein (MBP) linked to the C-terminal 353 amino acids of Shank (1454 to 1806) that includes the SAM domain. Thus, MBP-Shank adds approximately 670 residues to the SAM domain. When MBP-Shank was refolded and examined by EM, huge sheets were observed that contained over 100 long fibers stacked side by side (Fig. 3, A and B). These sheets exhibited local order, although the order broke down over long distances. Zn2þ is found in the PSD and is apparently important for PSD assembly (26, 27), so we were intrigued by the observation of a potential Zn2þ binding site in Shank-SAM. We noticed that in the Au2þ derivative used to solve the structure, Au2þ bound at a site that resembled the Zn2þ binding sites seen in zinc metalloproteases (28, 29). We therefore tested the ability of ShankSAM and two monomeric double mutants

Fig. 2. Mutations of Shank-SAM that disrupt assembly are located in the inter- and intrapolymer interfaces of the sheet. (A) Designed mutants are spread out over the monomer (pink) and have the potential to disrupt two types of interfaces, intra- and interpolymer. (B) The intrapolymer interface is between SAM domains within a polymer. Three M mutants (V52E, M56E, and L47E) and one PM mutant (V45E) are located in this interface (shown in red). We solved the structure of the M56E mutant; therefore, a Glu side chain is found at position 56. (C) The interpolymer interface (for which there are two contact points) is between SAM domains of neighboring polymers. The remaining three M mutants (W5E, S6E, and F8E) and three PM mutants (L4A, H22A, and L36E) are found in or near one of these two contact sites (shown in red). Although peripheral, H22A may destabilize the interpolymer interface by weakening the salt bridge that strengthens this interface. Fig. 3. The sheet structure can accommodate a large fusion protein at the N terminus, and the sheet becomes well ordered upon binding Zn2þ. (A) An EM image of MBP-Shank displayed a wide sheet consisting of hundreds of fibers. (B) The sideby-side packing of individual fibers can be seen, although order breaks down over long distances. (C) The crystal structure of ShankSAM bound to Zn2þ shows that Zn2þ is coordinated in a tetrahedral geometry to Glu21, His22, His54, and a chloride ion. The Zn2þ site is located where the intra- and interpolymer interfaces meet and appears to stabilize salt bridges across two interfaces: His54 with Glu30 and Glu21 with Arg23, respectively. Only minor conformational changes are seen when the Zn2þ structure (green) is overlaid with the apo structure (yellow and blue). (D) The arrangement of MBP-

Shank into a sheet becomes highly ordered in the presence of Zn2þ. (E) At high resolution, the helices appear more stiff, clearly defined, and woven together over longer distances than those in the absence of Zn2þ.

(W5E/S6E and V52E/M56E) to bind Zn2þ by using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis (30, 31). Even after overnight dialysis, we found 43, 53, and 54% Zn2þ occupancy for wild type, W5E/S6E, and V52E/M56E, respectively, indicating that Shank-SAM does have a high affinity Zn2þ binding site. To visualize how Zn2þ binds to Shank-SAM, we re-solved the structure of Shank-SAM in the presence of Zn2þ. Zn2þ was indeed bound in the same pocket as was Au2þ, and is coordinated in a tetrahedral geometry by E21, H22, H54, and electron density that we attribute to a chloride ion (Fig. 3C) (28). Superposition of the apo and Zn2þ structures (Fig. 3C) indicates that only minor conformational changes occur upon binding Zn2þ. The Zn2þ pocket is located where the inter- and intrapolymer interfaces meet. Furthermore, the ligands that coordinate Zn2þ form salt bridges across these two interfaces: E21 with R23 (intrapolymer) and H54 with E30 (interpolymer). Thus, the binding of Zn2þ may stabilize these salt bridges, mitigating the entropy cost of assembly. To investigate whether Zn2þ affects the formation of the SAM sheet, MBP-Shank was refolded in the presence of zinc acetate. Massive sheets were again seen, but they were remarkably better organized in the presence of Zn2þ (Fig. 3, D and E). The sheets are over 300 nm wide, containing more than 50 fibers packed together. In contrast to the sheets without Zn2þ, the interdigitation of pairs of helical fibers can be traced almost the entire length of the sheet (over 700 nm). The dramatically improved ordering of the sheet sugTable 1. Synaptic clustering ratios (SCR) and percentage colocalization with the presynaptic marker Bassoon (P/B) for Shank-416-GFP and variants.

The wild-type Shank-416-GFP has an SCR of 0.35 and a P/B between 67 and 94%, which is essentially the same as for the full-length Shank3 (23). Only those variants that showed significant clustering to synapses were analyzed for colocalization with Bassoon. Five mutations in the interfaces of the sheet (W5E, M56E, and all three double mutants) and a mutant that replaces a Zn2þ ligand (H22A) dramatically reduce localization. The remaining mutation, F8E, which is also located in the sheet interface, partially inhibits localization. Errors are SD.

gests that Zn2þ plays an important structural role in organizing Shank and further demonstrates that the sheet is compatible with a very large protein. To determine whether sheet construction is required for the integration of Shank into the PSD, we tested the effect of assembly mutants on Shank localization in hippocampal neurons of rats. Shank-416-GFP is a construct, consisting of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the C-terminal 416 residues of Shank, that localizes to synapses (23). Seven Shank-SAM mutants that disrupt sheet assembly (W5E, F8E, H22A, M56E, W5E/F8E, W5E/M56E, and L47E/M56E) (24) were introduced into Shank-416-GFP, expressed in hippocampal neurons, and examined for synaptic clustering. Synaptic localization was quantified by two parameters: (i) the synaptic clustering ratio (SCR), which is the ratio of GFP fluorescence in dendritic shafts versus spines, and (ii) the percentage of colocalization of clustered

Shank3 with the presynaptic marker Bassoon (P/B) (23). All seven assembly mutants disrupted localization (Table 1 and Fig. 4). The point mutants W5E and M56E (located in the inter- and intrapolymer interfaces, respectively), and all three double mutants completely prevented localization, suggesting that both interfaces of the sheet must be functional for Shank to be properly assembled in the PSD. Another interpolymer interface mutant, F8E, was found to partially disrupt localization. The elimination of the Zn2þ ligand in the H22A mutant also precluded localization, consistent with our in vitro findings of an important role for Zn2þ in sheet construction. Sheet-disrupting mutations also fail to localize to the synapse, which suggests that sheet formation is important for assembly of Shank3 in the PSD. We propose that Shank3 (and possibly other Shanks) creates a platform for the construction of the massive complex of proteins at the PSD.

Recent cryogenic EM imaging of the PSD in intact synapses revealed a regular row of electron-dense material running parallel to the postsynaptic membrane at È6-nm spacings, by our measurement (32). Although the nature of this array is not yet known, it could correspond to a view of a Shank organized sheet looking either down the ends of the fibers (È6-nm spacings due to fiber interdigitation). The proposed sheet structure, with radially projecting protein interaction domains, appears to be an ideal architecture for a protein that must contact both membrane and cytoplasmic components at a two-dimensional cell surface. The ability of Zn2þ to aid the organization of the Shank sheet raises the possibility that Zn2þ ions, which are released during neuronal activity (33­35), could directly modulate the PSD structure by regulating the assembly of Shank SAM domains.

Design and Evolution of New Catalytic Activity with an Existing Protein Scaffold
Hee-Sung Park,1 Sung-Hun Nam,1 Jin Kak Lee,2* Chang No Yoon,2 Bengt Mannervik,3 Stephen J. Benkovic,4 Hak-Sung Kim1 The design of enzymes with new functions and properties has long been a goal in protein engineering. Here, we report a strategy to change the catalytic activity of an existing protein scaffold. This was achieved by simultaneous incorporation and adjustment of functional elements through insertion, deletion, and substitution of several active site loops, followed by point mutations to fine-tune the activity. Using this approach, we were able to introduce b-lactamase activity into the ab/ba metallohydrolase scaffold of glyoxalase II. The resulting enzyme, evMBL8 (evolved metallo b-lactamase 8), completely lost its original activity and, instead, catalyzed the hydrolysis of cefotaxime with a (kcat /Km)app of 1.8 Â 102 (mole/liter)­1 second­1, thus increasing resistance to Escherichia coli growth on cefotaxime by a factor of about 100. nzymes with new functions targeted at practical applications have long been a goal of protein engineering, and advances have been made with methods involving structurebased rational design or directed evolution (1­4). These approaches allow improvement of specific enzyme characteristics such as folding and stability (5), substrate specificity and enantioselectivity (6), and catalytic activity (7), but the design of enzymes with new functions remains a challenge. Computational design of proteins has had notable successes, culminating in Hellinga and co-workers_ report (8) introducing triose phosphate isomerase activity into a noncatalytic ribose-binding protein. However, a lack of understanding of structure-function relations continues

to hinder rational design, and methods relying on accumulation of point mutations remain desirable. We have used an approach designated SIAFE (simultaneous incorporation and adjustment of functional elements), in conjunction with directed evolution, to introduce new catalytic activity into an existing scaffold. A schematic illustration of the SIAFE process is presented in fig. S1. SIAFE consists of insertion, deletion, and substitution of gene segments in addition to the conventional directed evolution method of accumulating point mutations, mimicking natural protein evolution (9, 10). Functional elements (catalytic and substrate-binding elements) that constitute the active site are designed on the basis of sequence, mechanistic,

and structural information and are incorporated into a template scaffold in a programmed and combinatorial manner. Using this approach, we generated b-lactamase activity from the glyoxalase II ab/ba metallohydrolase scaffold. The ab/ba four-layer sandwich scaffold is proposed to have diverged extensively during evolution to give rise to a superfamily of metallohydrolase enzymes that are distributed over Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria. This superfamily catalyzes a variety of diverse reactions and includes metallo b-lactamase (MBL), glyoxalase II (GlyII), flavoprotein, arylsulfatase, type II polyketide synthase, b-CASP family, cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-N-acetylneuraminate hydroxylase, and phosphodiesterase (11). GlyII and MBL catalyze unrelated metabolic reactions, but their marginal structural similarity and conserved metal-binding site suggest that they are evolutionarily related (12) so that they present a typical example of the differentiation of a progenitor scaffold. GlyII (EC 3. 1. 2. 6) is involved in the hydrolysis of the thiolester bond of S-Dlactoylglutathione (Fig. 1A), a critical step in the conversion of cytotoxic 2-oxoaldehyde into 2-hydroxycarboxylic acids that occurs in the cyto1 Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 373-1, Kusung-Dong, Yusung-Gu, Daejon 305-701, Korea. 2Bioanalysis and Biotransformation Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Post Office Box 131, Cheongryang, Seoul 130-650, Korea. 3Department of Biochemistry, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Box 576, SE-751 23 Uppsala, Sweden. 4Department of Chemistry, The Pennsylvania State University, 104 Chemistry Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA.
