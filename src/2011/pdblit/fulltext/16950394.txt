Human kallikrein 5 (hK5) is a member of the tissue kallikrein family of serine peptidases. It has trypsin-like substrate specificity, is inhibited by metal ions, and is abundantly expressed in human skin, where it is believed to play a central role in desquamation. To further understand the interaction of hK5 with substrates and metal ions, active recombinant hK5 was crystallized in complex with the tripeptidyl aldehyde inhibitor leupeptin, and structures at 2.3 Å resolution were obtained with and without Zn2+. While the overall structure and the specificity of S1 pocket for basic sidechains were similar to that of hK4, a closely related family member, both differed in their interaction with Zn2+. Unlike hK4, the 75-loop of hK5 is not structured to bind a Zn2+. Instead, Zn2+ binds adjacent to the active site, becoming coordinated by the imidazole rings of His99 and His96 not present in hK4. This zinc binding is accompanied by a large shift in the backbone conformation of the 99-loop and by large movements of both His side-chains. Modeling studies show that in the absence of bound leupeptin, Zn2+ is likely further coordinated by the imidazolyl side-chain of the catalytic His57 which can, similar to equivalent His57 imidazole groups in the related rat kallikrein proteinase tonin and in an engineered metalbinding rat trypsin, rotate out of its triad position to provide the third coordination site of the bound Zn2+, rendering Zn2+-bound hK5 inactive. In solution, this mode of binding likely occurs in the presence of free and substrate saturated hK5, as kinetic analyses of Zn2+ inhibition indicate a non-competitive mechanism. Supporting the His57 re-orientation, Zn2+ does not fully inhibit hK5 hydrolysis of tripeptidyl substrates containing a P2­His residue. The P2 and His57 imidazole groups would lie next to each other in the enzyme­substrate complex, indicating that incomplete inhibition is due to competition between both imidazole groups for Zn2+. The His96-99-57 triad is thus suggested to be responsible for the Zn2+mediated inhibition of hK5 catalysis.

Introduction
Human tissue kallikrein 5 (hK5, or kallikrein-like protein 2, KLK-L2) is a member of the human tissue kallikreins, family S1A, clan PA(S), comprising 15 kallikrein-like serine peptidases (hKs or KLKs).1­3 While hK5 is found in many tissues,4 it appears to be most abundantly expressed in human skin.5 HK5 and hK7 were first isolated from human plantar stratum corneum and given the name human stratum corneum tryptic (HSCTE)6 and chymotryptic (HSCCE)7 enzymes, respectively. Both are speci-

1018 fically expressed in the upper spinous and granular layers of skin,8,9 where keratinocytes undergo terminal differentiation and are transformed into flattened brick-like structures (corneocytes) that form the stratum corneum.10 The stratum corneum functions as a barrier to the outside environment and is maintained through constant replacement of corneocytes shed by the process of desquamation.10 HK5 and hK7 appear to be stored within the lamellar granules of differentiating keratinocytes, suggesting they are secreted into the extracellular space of the stratum corneum upon its formation.8,9 In the extracellular space, hK5 and hK7 are believed to contribute to desquamation by hydrolyzing proteins composing intercellular adhesion structures called corneo-desmosomes.11,12 Because hK5 is capable of activating pro-hK7 and other pro-hKs, its role in desquamation may be essential.13 Both, hK5 and hK7, may play pathological roles in skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis and Netherton syndrome.14,15 The latter disorder has been linked to mutations in SPINK5 (serine protease inhibitor Kazal 5),15 a gene that codes for the proteinase inhibitor LEKTI (lympho-epithelial Kazal type inhibitor).16 LEKTI co-localizes with both hK5 and hK7 in skin16,25 and inhibits each proteinase in vitro,17,18 suggesting that it may function to regulate kallikrein proteinase activities in skin. The lack of this regulation in Netherton syndrome may lead to the defects in stratum corneum structure associated with the disorder.19­21 The function of hK5 in tissues other than skin is less clear, but there is now growing evidence that over-expression of hK5 occurs in endocrine-related malignancies including ovarian, breast and testicular cancer.22 Thus, the function of hK5 is not limited to skin (patho)physiology. hK5 exhibits a trypsin-like specificity, with a strong preference for P1-Arg over Lys residues.23,24 It has been shown to be capable of digesting various extra-cellular matrix and plasma proteins. Furthermore, hK5 can be inhibited by the plasma protein inhibitors 2-antiplasmin, antithrombin III and 2macroglobulin23 as well as by Zn 2+ and other divalent cations.25 Like the other trypsin-like serine proteinases, hK5 is biosynthesized as an inactive 293 amino acid residue pre-pro-enzyme, from which, upon entrance into the secretory pathway, a 29 amino acid residue signal peptide is cleaved off, followed by cleavage at the Arg66­Ile67 peptide bond (Ile16 compared to chymotrypsinogen) and removal of the 37 amino acid residue pro-peptide, liberating the 227 residue active enzyme.6 In order to understand the structural basis of the narrow substrate specificity and the Zn2+ inhibition of hK5, we have expressed and purified active recombinant hK5, analyzed its Zn2+ inhibition with different substrates, and crystallized and solved the X-ray crystal structure of this proteinase in complex with the peptide inhibitor leupeptin both in the absence of Zn2+ as well as after crystal soaking in Zn2+ solution. These studies reveal that hK5 is inhibited by Zn2+ through binding to a site in the vicinity of the active site, with the His57 imidazole

group of the catalytic triad playing an essential role. They furthermore provide structural information about the substrate specificity of hK5, which might be used to design specific drugs against skin inflammation and cancer.

Results and Discussion
Inhibition of hK5 by Zn2+ The inhibition of the hK5 activity by Zn2+ was studied at three different pH values using Bz-ProPhe-Arg-pNA as substrate. Virtually complete inhibition of catalytic activity was observed at pH 7.0 and pH 8.0, while little, if any, inhibition was seen at pH 5.5 (Figure 1(a)). The enzyme activity was restored by addition of EDTA to Zn2+-inhibited hK5 showing reversibility (data not shown). Fits of the data to equation (2) (see Materials and Methods) yielded Ki values for Zn2+ inhibition of 8.0( ± 1.0) M at pH 7.0 and 2.0( ± 0.3) M at pH 8.0. The magnitude of these values is similar to that reported for the Zn2+ inhibition of hK2 (3­4 M)26 and lower than those measured for hK3 (50­80 M)27 and hK4 (16 M).28 The pH dependence of inhibition supports the crystal structures that will be shown later, which indicate that multiple His residues form the Zn2+ binding site. A similar inhibition of hK5 activity by Zn2+ was observed using the fluorimetric substrates Tos-GlyPro-Arg-AMC and H-Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC, yielding IC50 values around 9 M at pH 7.0 (Figure 1(b)). The analysis of the inhibition by kinetic methods is given in Figure 1(c). As shown by the activity versus substrate concentration plots at different Zn 2+ concentrations, the mechanism of inhibition appears to be non-competitive, which posits that Zn 2+ inhibits the free and substrate saturated enzyme with equal affinity. A marked change in the strength and extent of Zn2+ inhibition was observed, however, if the P2-His containing substrate H-Gly-HisArg-AMC was used in the studies (Figure 1(b)). In this case, inhibition required higher Zn2+ concentrations (yielding an IC50 value of about 20 M) and was not complete, with about 15% of the activity remaining unaffected by Zn2+. Inhibition of the hydrolysis of this P2­His substrate is consistent with a non-competitive kinetic mechanism, in which the Zn­enzyme­substrate complex is able to form product at a slower rate than the free enzyme. The analysis of crystal structures discussed below will show that the hydrolysis of H-Gly-His-Arg-AMC by the Zn-bound enzyme may be explained by the P2­ His residue substituting for His57 either in catalysis or more likely in the ligation of Zn2+. Overall structure So far all attempts to crystallize human hK5 in the presence of benzamidine or free of any inhibitor have been unsuccessful. Only an hK5 complex with

1019 the active site blocked by the aldehyde inhibitor leupeptin could be crystallized. A first 2.3 Å data set was collected from crystals treated with picolinic acid, to remove any bound Zn2+. The corresponding hK5 structure free of Zn2+ will be referred to as hK5Zn-free (Table 1). Upon soaking with 10 mM ZnCl2, these crystals changed their cell constants slightly. The corresponding 2.3 Å structure of hK5, which binds one "endogenous" Zn2+ close to the active site (see below) and two Zn ions sandwiched between two adjacent molecules, is referred to as hK5-Zn. Except for the vicinity of the principal Zn2+ binding site (see below), the conformation of the hK5­ leupeptin complex was mostly unchanged upon Zn2+ binding except for the 99-loop, which adopts a different conformation. In the following, these structures will essentially be described together, except for the molecular section around the main Zn2+ binding site. The hK5 molecule resembles an oblate ellipsoid with diameters of 35 Å and 50 Å, respectively. Similar to other (chymo)trypsin-like serine proteinases, the polypeptide chain of hK5 folds essentially into two abutting six-stranded -barrels, strapped together by three trans-domain segments, two helices and several surface-located loops (Figure 2 (a)). The catalytic triad consisting of Ser195, His57 and Asp102 (chymotrypsinogen numbering29) is located along the junction of both barrels, while the active-site cleft with the recognition sub-sites S4 to S3 runs perpendicular to this junction. The hK5 structure is topologically similar to that of the other tissue kallikreins (not shown). Of the kallikreins of known crystal structure, hK5 is (according to an rms deviation of 0.65/0.63 Å for 204/196 topologically equivalent C atoms, using a 2.0 Å threshold) most similar to hK428 and hK6,30 while hK7, which on the basis of sequence alignment alone had been subgrouped with hK4 and hK5,31,32 is more distant (M.D. et al., unpublished rsesults). A structure-based sequence alignment of hK5 with chymotrypsinogen (Figure 2(b)) reveals a single-residue deletion after residue 67, a two-residue deletion after residue 125, a four-residue deletion after 203, and single-residue insertions after residues 74, 186 and 221 (marked by alphanumeric suffixes following the residue number of the preceding common residue). In mature hK5, the 227 amino acid residue polypeptide chain starts with Ile16. As in most other trypsin-like serine proteinases, its -ammonium group forms an internal salt bridge with the side chain carboxylate of Asp194, which (after activation cleavage) induces formation of a functional oxyanion hole at the active site and of a correctly shaped S1 pocket, accompanied by rigidification of the whole activation domain (Figure 2(a)). The mature hK5 crystallized in this study terminates with Ser246 and exhibits, like all other tissue kallikreins except hK14, a cis-Pro219.29 Its single polypeptide chain is, like that of most other kallikreins and of trypsin, cross-connected by six disulfide bridges, namely Cys22­Cys157, Cys42­ Cys58, Cys128­Cys232, Cys136­Cys201, Cys168­

The data indicate non-competitive inhibition as the three regression lines show a lower Vmax for the inhibited than free enzyme and all lines intercept the xaxis very close to each other. The Ki and KM calculated from the data are 8 µM and 4 mM, respectively.

Glycosylation and surface loops The hK5 sequence contains four consensus sites for N-linked carbohydrates (Figure 2(b)). Adjacent to the Asn159-Ile160-Ser161 segment, i.e. opposite to the active-site cleft, the electron density clearly indicates the presence of a carbohydrate chain

N-linked to Asn159 (see Figure 2(a)). This density fits well with a proximal 2-acetamido-2-deoxy--Dglucopyranose (GlucNAc), -1,4-linked to a second GlucNAc sugar. The electron density does not indicate the presence of a more distal branched mannose-type sugar or of a laterally attached fucose. However, beyond the second GlucNAc there is empty intermolecular space in the crystals to accommodate also a longer disordered carbohydrate chain. This carbohydrate does not contact the protein moiety and could function to protect the molecule against proteolysis. The recombinant hK5

A consensus

used here as well as native hK5 isolated from skin have an apparent molecular mass equal to or greater than 30 kDa when measured by SDS­PAGE, whereas 25 kDa is the calculated molecular mass based on the amino acid sequence. This higher than expected mass seen in SDS­PAGE analyses has been

1022 glycosylation sequence at position Asn159-Xaa-Ser/ Thr is also present in hKs-4, - 9, - 11, - 12 and - 15 indicating that these other hKs might be similarly glycosylated in the tissues where they are expressed. Of the loops surrounding and shaping the activesite cleft of hK5, the 37-loop, the 75-("calcium binding")-loop, and the 99-loop (with loops numbered according to the central residue of the loop segment) are of particular interest (see Figure 2). Relative to chymotrypsinogen, most hKs except hK5 have residue 37 deleted. Residue 37 in hK5 is a Pro, and its presence allows the 37-loop to protrude into the solvent to a greater extent than the corresponding loops in other hKs. The 37-loop is remarkably well defined/ordered in the crystal structure, presumably due to the stiffening effect of Pro37. In most trypsin-like proteinases secreted by the pancreas or involved in blood coagulation, the 75loop mediates binding of Ca2+, which functions to stabilize the structure of these proteinases.33 Due to insertion of Pro74a between residues 74 and 75, the 75-loop of hK5 is one residue longer than in trypsin, chymotrypsin and in most other hKs, except hK4, which has an Ala at position 74a (Figures 2(b) and 3). In hK4, this loop participates in binding of Zn2+, which inhibits the hydrolysis of model peptide chromogenic substrates by about 70%, with the Zn2+ coordinated by the carboxyl group of Glu77 and the imidazolyl side-chain of His25.28 Although His25 and Glu77 are also present in hK5, Zn2+ is not found bound to this loop in the hK5-Zn structure. The extending His70 and Gln80 side-chains would not allow a partially helical loop conformation as observed for hK4, thus precluding a similar Zn2+ binding mode. The 75-loop of hK5 is shaped more like a wheel, with the side-chains of His70 and Glu77

Crystal Structure of Human Kallikrein 5

extending towards the hub of the wheel from opposite sides (Figure 3). The imidazole group of His70 is hydrogen bonded to the backbone oxygen atoms of Ser72 and Val75, and the Glu77 carboxyl group receives hydrogen bonds from the amide nitrogen atoms of Tyr71 and Ser72. It is nevertheless of interest that one of the inter-molecular Zn2+ ions in the hK5 structure is ligated to His25 and Asp117. The 75-loop of hK5 does not have the capacity to bind Ca2+, as Glu70 and Glu80, which mediate Ca2+ binding in other serine proteinases,33 are replaced by His and Gln residues, respectively (see Figure 2(b)). The 99-loop of hK5 does not exhibit the large kallikrein insert present in hKs 1, 2 and 3,29,34 but adopts a main-chain topology similar to that in chymotrypsin/trypsin and (pro)hK6.30,35 As will be discussed later in more detail, two His residues within this loop at positions 96 and 99 mediate Zn2+ binding. Both His residues are not present in the equivalent hK4 loop, which contains Arg and Leu, respectively, at these positions. Based on the amino acid composition, hK5, with a 31:14 ratio of basic and acidic residues, is a highly basic protein, with a calculated isoelectric point of 9.2. Many of the basic residues are clustered but not charge-compensated by negatively charged residues, giving rise to a large positively charged surface patch, extending from surface sites above the prime side of the active-site cleft (Arg59, Lys60, Lys61, Arg36, Arg64, Arg66, His69; seen in standard orientation as presented in Figures 2(a) and 4(b)) to the molecular surface where this cleft levels off (Lys87, Lys107, His48, Arg111, Arg110, Arg113). This patch overlaps the distal part of an even larger basic patch in hK7 (M.D. et al., unpublished results) and has similarities with the functionally important

anion binding exosite I of thrombin.36 Consistent with the presence of an exosite that can bind polyanionic molecules, recombinant hK5 binds to heparin-Sepharose and requires higher than physiological salt for elution (0.3 M NaCl, data not shown). Active-site cleft and substrate specificity The main catalytic elements of (chymo)trypsin family members, such as the Ser195-His57-Asp102 active-site triad and the oxyanion hole, are also present in hK5. Leupeptin, a tripeptidyl inhibitor with the sequence Ac-Leu1i-Leu2i-Arg3i, inhibits hK5 with a Ki value of 1.7( ± 0.2 M (see Materials and Methods). Complexed to hK5 before crystallization, it is situated in the active site cleft in a canonical conformation (Figure 4(a)). In the hK5-Znfree structure, the carbonyl carbon of the P1-Arg3i aldehyde group is covalently linked to Ser195 O forming a hemiacetal. The carbonyl carbon clearly

exhibits an L configuration, with the oxygen directed into the oxyanion hole provided by Gly193 N-H and Ser195 N-H. The leupeptin inhibitor aligns to enzyme segment Ser214-Gly216 in a twisted antiparallel manner, forming the characteristic inter-main chain hydrogen bonds between P3-Leu1i and Gly216, and P1-Arg3i and Ser214 (Figure 4(a)). The Arg3i side-chain extends into the S1 specificity pocket formed by the 226­228 segment (lining the back in standard orientation, as used in Figures 2(a), 4 and 5), the 214­220 segment (top), and the 190­193 segment (bottom), and is covalently closed by the Cys191­ Cys220 disulfide bond. This pocket is, as in hK428 and hK6,30 well suited to bind the P1-Arg3i sidechain of leupeptin. Gly216 and Gly226 provide a lane for this large side-chain to insert, and within the pocket the Asp189 carboxylate group, Ser190 O, a buried water molecule (OH98) and the Asp217 carbonyl group are suitably placed to form hydrogen

1024 bonds to the Arg3i guanidyl group, thereby neutralizing its charge. A systematic amino acid profiling study to establish the substrate specificity of hK5 revealed an unusually strong selectivity for Arg over

Lys residues by the S1 pocket.23,24 A similar but weaker preference was observed for the closely related kallikreins hK428 and hK6.30 The current hK5 structure does not suggest a reason for this strong

1025 size is presumably regulated by binding to cofactor VIIIa.43 The Tyr99 phenolic group in the structures of benzamidine-inhibited porcine kallikrein (pK1)29 and of unliganded hK134 is anchored to the mainchain similar to the His99 side-chain of hK5, but extends further into the S2 cleft. In the pK1 complex with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor,44 the Tyr99 side-chain has swung over towards the adjacent S4 sub-site to give way to the larger P2-Cys14i­Cys38i disulfide bridge of the bound inhibitor. As shown upon Zn2+ binding, the His99 side-chain of hK5 is also mobile, resulting in an adaptable S2 cleft (see below). The S3 sub-site interaction in (chymo)trypsin-like serine proteinases is largely made via backbone interactions between the P3 residue of the inhibitor/ substrate and Gly216. In hK5, P3-Leu1i forms two inter-main chain hydrogen bonds with Gly216 (Figure 4(a)). Unlike many other proteinases with trypsin-like specificity, residue 218 lining the S1 pocket is not deleted in the kallikreins, somewhat enlarging the S1 pocket. In hK5, residue 218 is a Tyr. The structure reveals its phenolic group being placed at the entrance to the S1 pocket, oriented nearly perpendicular to the pocket opening. Loosely based on this phenolic ring, the P3-Leu1i side-chain extends into the solvent. The proximity of both sidechains is consistent with the results of substrate profiling studies indicating that hK5 has a slight preference for more bulky P3 side chains.24 In the hK5-Zn-free structure, the N-acetyl group of leupeptin is hydrogen-bonded via its carbonyl group to the imidazole of His99. This interaction is consistent with a "canonical" P4­S4 sub-site interaction. The S4 sub-site, occupied by the methyl moiety of the acetyl group, is a shallow trough-like structure, with the side-chain of Trp215 forming the base and the polar side-chains of His99 and Gln174 the sides. Identification of the Zn2+ binding site producing inhibition Upon Zn 2+ soaking, three prominent density peaks appeared in the anomalous difference Fourier map indicating metal/zinc binding. The first of these bound metal ions (M1 in Figure 2(a)) located outside

selectivity for Arg residues. It has been shown that replacing Ser190 with Ala shifts the P1 preference of trypsin-like proteinases from Arg towards Lys.37 This paradigm is not supported by our data, which show that hK5 as well as hKs 4 and 6 have a clear preference for P1-Arg residues despite having a Ser residue at position 190. Also contributing to leupeptin binding is an interaction with the carboxamide group of Gln192. The N2 atom of Gln192 forms a hydrogen bond partly to the carbonyl oxygen of the P2-Leu2i residue and partly to a water molecule that is localized in the S1 pocket through hydrogen bonds with P1-Arg3i N and the carbonyl groups of Gly216 and Asp217. Through these hydrogen bonds, Gln192 can contribute to a better hydrolysis of bound peptide substrates.38 Gln192 is found in many trypsin-like serine proteinases including trypsin and tryptase, and crystal structures of both proteinases complexed to leupeptin38,39 show backbone interactions with Gln192 similar to those just described for hK5. The S2 sub-site of hK5 (Figure 4) is primarily a hydrophobic triangular slot laterally confined by the imidazolyl side chains of His57 and His99, and on top capped by the phenolic O-H group of Tyr94, with Trp215 closing the bottom end. The relatively small size and the polar tip of this S2 sub-site is consistent with hK5s preference for small to medium-sized residues at P2 (Ser, Thr, Asn, Ala).24 To slot into this hydrophobic S2 cavity, the more bulky P2-Leu2i side-chain of leupeptin likely requires a small shift of the His99 side-chain to slightly enlarge this cavity. Several trypsin-like serine proteinases have His or Tyr residues in the 99 position (see Figure 2(b)). Due to a different main chain course, the homologous His99 residue in the structure of urokinase complexed to the inhibitor Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone40 extends far into the S2 cavity forming a pocket of very limited size. Similarly, the equivalent Tyr99 phenolic side-chain of coagulation factor Xa41 limits the S2 cavity to preferentially accommodate P2-Gly residues of peptide substrates. The equivalent Tyr99 side-chain of benzamidine-inhibited factor IXa,42 in contrast, points, due to an overcrowded 99-loop, into the adjacent S4 cavity generating a larger S2 cleft, whose

The loop residues are superimposed with the final 2Fobs­Fcalc electron density (blue network; contouring at 1) and the F+obs­F-obs anomalous difference electron density (magenta network; contouring at 10 ) localized around the bound Zn2+. The two Zn2+-ligating water molecules are given as small blue spheres. The electrostatic interactions between this principal Zn2+ and the atoms of the first coordination sphere are indicated by dotted lines. (b) Section of hK5-Zn around the 99-loop and leupeptin (stick model, with pink, carbon; blue, nitrogen; and red, oxygen atoms). The hK5 main-chain in the absence and the presence of Zn2+ is shown as grey and golden ribbons, respectively, with residues His96, His99 and His57 given with their full side-chains (with green and orange carbons, respectively); the principal Zn2+ is represented by a magenta sphere. (c) Section of hK5-Zn around the 99-loop and leupeptin, with the P2-Leu side-chain replaced by a His side-chain (thick stick model, with green, carbon; blue, nitrogen; and red, oxygen atoms). In addition, the side-chain of His57 (thick, orange carbon atoms) has been rotated, as in tonin, into a position (His57*, thin stick model; orange, carbon atoms; superimposed by a van der Waals surface), where it could additionally ligate the principal Zn2+. Furthermore, the P2-His imidazolyl group has been rotated (thin stick models, with green carbon atoms) towards the Zn2+ (P2-His*, thin stick model; green. carbon atoms; superimposed with a van der Waals surface) to show that it can replace the His57* imidazole in ligating this Zn2+, as well as towards the active site, to show how it could replace the catalytic His57 imidazole group in the catalytic triad.

1026 of the molecular surface close to the 145-loop is coordinated by the N2 atom of the exposed His150 imidazole ring (2.5 Å) and by several water molecules. The extremely high B-value (128 Å2) obtained if full Zn 2+ occupancy is anticipated indicates that this site is only partially occupied by a Zn2+. The second Zn2+ (M2) is coordinated by the N2 atom of the His25 imidazolyl side-chain (2.4 Å), one of both Asp117 carboxylate oxygen atoms (2.7 Å), the carboxylate group of a Glu240 residue from a symmetry-related molecule, and surrounding not very well resolved water molecules. According to the refinement statistics (Table 1), the occupancy of this second Zn2+ site is higher than that of the first Zn2+ site, but the middle-rate anomalous difference density (3 ) and the still very high B value (97 Å2) indicate only partial occupancy. Because of the contribution of a carboxylate group provided by a symmetry-related molecule, this second metal binding site can be considered as a crystal artifact. Interestingly, this site is close to the equivalent Zn2+ site in hK4, where we have recently shown that Zn2+ upon binding modulates the proteolytic activity via the amino terminus and the salt bridge with Asp194.35 As mentioned above, the different 75loop seems to preclude a similar Zn2+ binding in hK5. In contrast, the third Zn2+ binding site (see Figure 2(a)) situated on the surface of a single hK5 molecule seems to be fully occupied by Zn2+ (10, 54 Å2) under the soaking conditions chosen. This Zn2+ is coordinated by the N1 atom of His96 (2.3 Å), the N2 atom of His99 (2.4 Å), and two well-ordered water molecules (2.2 Å and 2.5 Å), which together form an almost regular tetrahedral first coordination sphere (Figure 5(a)). In order to ligate this Zn2+, both imidazolyl side-chains have to move compared with their position in hK5-Zn-free (see Figure 5(b)). Upon Zn 2+ binding, the His99 imidazole ring slides slightly along the P2-Leu2i side-chain of the bound leupeptin, while the His96 imidazolyl side-chain swings from an exposed "up" position before to a more buried "down" position after Zn2+ binding. These replacements are accompanied by a large conformational change of the Ser95­His99 mainchain, which includes a transcis transition in the His96­Pro97 peptide bond and a large rotation of the Gly98­His99 peptide bond. The bound leupeptin inhibitor does not seem to be much affected by these movements, except for the break of the (weak) hydrogen bond from His99 N2 to the carbonyl group of the N-acetyl group. However, the electron density around the P1-Arg3i-Ser195 adduct unambiguously indicates that the hemiacetal group now preferentially adopts an R configuration, with the oxygen pointing out of the oxyanion hole to form a weak hydrogen bond with the N2 atom of the His57 imidazole ring. A similar R configuration of the hemiacetal group and out-of-oxyanion hole position of the oxygen has recently been observed in the trypsin-leupeptin complex,39 while both configurations had been found at about equal populations in the Streptomyces griseus proteinase A complex with chymostatin.45 In the hK5­leupeptin structure, the

two conformers/configurations seem to be of similar free energy. HK5 obviously responds to changes in the vicinity brought about by Zn2+ binding by interchanging from one state to the other. The principal Zn 2+ binding site of hK5-Zn resembles that of Zn2+-bound inhibitor-free tonin, a rat kallikrein proteinase found in the submaxillary gland.46 In this tonin structure, an equivalent Zn2+ is coordinated by the imidazole nitrogens from three His residues: an identically located His99 residue, an equally arranged His97 residue, and the active site His57 residue. The imidazolyl side-chain of this latter His57 is rotated out of its catalytic position between Ser195 and Asp102, resulting in loss of enzymatic activity.46 Inspection of the hK5­Zn structure indicates that the His57 imidazolyl group of unliganded hK5 could likewise act as a Zn2+-coordinating group via its N2 atom (see Figure 5(c)). This would require rotation (around 1/2 from +64°/- 95° to about - 110°/ - 10°) out of its catalytic position between Ser195 O and the Asp102 carboxylate group towards this Zn2+ site. Ligation of Zn2+ by His57 would nicely explain the inactivation of hK5 by Zn2+, measured with several photometric and fluorimetric substrates (see Figure 1). In the more rigid hK5­leupeptin crystal structure, such a re-arrangement seems to be precluded, due to the tight packing of the His57 imidazole group between the P2-Leu2i side-chain of the pre-bound leupeptin and the Cys42­Cys58 disulfide bridge, and because of its hydrogen bond fixation to Ser195 O and to the P1-Arg3i carbonyl oxygen. Furthermore, the reoriented His57 imidazole group would get very close to the P2-Leu2i side-chain in its current conformation. The non-competitive inhibition mechanism for Zn-inhibition of hK5 indicates that Zn2+ binding to free and substrate saturated enzyme is similar. As stated above, ligation of Zn2+ by His57 as described by modeling would certainly produce inactivation of catalytic activity, whereas Zn2+ ligation by only His96 and 99 as seen in the Zn­hK5-bound structure might affect substrate binding, but would not be expected produce the virtually complete catalytic inactivation seen for the hydrolysis of most peptide substrates. Supporting a role for His57 in the binding of Zn2+ to free and substrate saturated enzyme is the inhibition studies showing that Zn2+ does not inhibit the hydrolysis of tripeptide substrates with His at P2 as completely as those with Phe or Pro at P2 (see Figure 1(a)). We suggest that the most likely explanation for the hydrolysis of H-Gly-His-Arg-AMC in the presence of saturating Zn2+ is the ability of the P2 His residue in the enzyme­substrate complex to substitute for His57 in the ligation of Zn2+. As discussed, modeling studies show that such a P2-His imidazole group of a bound peptide substrate would occupy an ideal position to ligate the Zn2+ via its N2 atom (see Figure 5(c)). Such a ligation would compete with that mediated through the His57 imidazole ring, permitting the His57 side-chain to remain in its normal position as part of the catalytic triad.

1027 that in the crystalline leupeptin­hK5­Zn2+ complex, His57 could not participate in Zn2+ binding because it was kinetically trapped by the bound inhibitor. We suggest that in solution the His57 imidazolyl sidechain of hK5 can swing, as in tonin46 and in the Arg96His mutant of rat trypsin,49 out of its catalytic site to occupy the third coordination site of the Zn2+, and that this rearrangement occurs in the absence or presence of bound substrate. The location of His99 and His96 in the neighborhood of the active center in hK5 generates a Zn2+ binding site, which attracts the His57 side-chain for maximal stabilization. We strongly suggest that this participation of His57 in the ligation of Zn2+ is the structural basis of the noncompetitive hK5 inhibition, and that the bound Zn2+ does not preclude binding of peptide substrates, but interferes with efficient hydrolytic cleavage, due to removal of the catalytically essential His57 imidazole ring from the catalytic triad. Substrates with a P2-His residue can partially rescue activity, because the P2-His imidazole can compete with the His57 imidazolyl side-chain for Zn 2+, thus permitting His57 involvement in catalysis. At present, the physiological significance of hK5 inhibition by Zn2+ is unclear. Zn2+ is an essential dietary mineral required for function by 70­80 enzymes.50 In human epidermis hK5 is believed to play a role in desquamation. Zn2+ levels are unusually high in the epidermis (50­70 g/g dry weight compared 5­10 g/g dry weight in the dermis),51 and it has been suggested that the Zn2+/ Ca2+ ratio plays a role in skin maturation.50 Interestingly, Zn2+ levels appear lowest in the granular layer and decrease towards the basal layer,51 while Ca2+ levels show an opposite gradient. Topical ZnO has been used for years to improve wound healing and re-epithelialization.50 It has been assumed the ZnO entering a wound slowly breaks down to Zn2+, and the increased Zn 2+ induces/activates Zn2+ containing proteins such as DNA and RNA polymerase, nuclear factors and metalloproteinases. Our study raises the possibility that Zn2+ inhibition of hK5 and other kallikreins also may play a role in wound healing.

Another possibility to explain the hK5 hydrolysis of H-Gly-His-Arg-AMC at saturating Zn2+ concentrations assumes a "substrate-assisted catalysis" mechanism. Modeling studies docking the H-GlyHis-Arg-moiety to hK5 show that the P2-His imidazolyl side-chain, upon adopting 1/2 angles of about - 150°/- 60°, could slot into the gap left by the His57 imidazole group between Ser195 O and Asp102 (see Figure 5(c)). The position of the P2-His imidazole ring would not exactly match that of the His57 imidazole in the intact catalytic triad, but could still establish favorable 2.8 Å and 3.0 Å hydrogen bonds to the Ser195 O and one of the Asp102 carboxylate oxygen atoms. Such a substrateassisted catalysis mechanism has previously been postulated for the hydrolysis of the P2-His substrate Suc-Phe-Ala-His-Phe-pNA by the His64Ala subtilisin mutant of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens.47 Although the hydrolysis rate for the substrate was 5000-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, it was still 400 times faster than the hydrolysis of homologous P2-Ala or P2-Gln substrates. The authors argued that this effect reflects participation of the P2-His imidazole in catalysis, and mentioned that a similar substitution mechanism might also apply for trypsin-like serine proteinases. They further suggested that the low rate of catalysis compared to the wildtype enzyme presumably reflects the still poor match of the His57 by the P2-His imidazole. Because such a large reduction in catalytic activity was observed for the hK5 hydrolysis of H-Gly-His-ArgAMC, we believe, however, that the above-mentioned "substrate-assisted Zn2+ coordination" is the main mechanism, by which the P2-His substrate counteracts the full inhibition by Zn2+ . The propensity of the His57 imidazolyl side-chain to participate in the binding of transition state metals when another His residue is nearby has been demonstrated in vitro for rat trypsin. Rat trypsin normally is not inhibited by divalent cations, but was transformed into a copper-sensitive proteinase with a Ki of 21 M by mutation of Arg96 to a His residue.48 A crystal structure analysis of this Arg96His mutant made in the presence of 1 mM CuCl2 revealed that the His57 imidazolyl side-chain is re-oriented out of the active site similar to that modeled for His57 in hK5. In this case only the imidazole groups of His96 and His57 were necessary to form the metal binding site,49 while, except for small movements of the peptide backbone near residue 96, the remainder of the trypsin molecule was iso-structural with the wild-type enzyme.

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification of hK5 and inhibition by leupeptin Recombinant hK5 was expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell system as part of a fusion protein with the structure: ubiquitin,enterokinase cleavage site, hK5(Ile16-Ser246).52 The fusion protein (FP) from 2 l of culture medium was partially purified on a 100 mL heparin-Sepharose column. The culture medium was absorbed to the resin, and the fusion protein was eluted in a single step of 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M Mops (pH 6.8). The FP pool was dialyzed to 0.2 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), and then activated with porcine enterokinase. Activity was monitored in assays using the substrate Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA. The enterokinase selectively cleaved the Lys­Ile16 bond liberating active hK5. This active hK5 was further purified using a

Conclusion
Here we show that Zn2+ is a specific inhibitor of hK5 exhibiting Ki values of 2 M to 8 M. The mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition was non-competitive, which would indicate that Zn2+ binds to free hK5 and the substrate saturated hK5 with equal affinity. We postulate that this interaction involves the ligation of Zn2+ by His57, 96, and 99 and presume

benzamidine-Sepharose column (50 ml). The column was equilibrated, and protein loaded and eluted in of 0.75 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). hK5 eluting well after the major protein peak was pooled, adjusted to 0.2 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), and chromatographed further on a heparin-Sepharose column. hK5 adsorbed to the column was eluted in a single step of 0.5 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris (pH 8.0). SDS­gels of the purified material showed a single band migrating with an apparent size of 30 kDa. Concentration measurements based on A280 and active site titration with inhibitors53 indicated that the purified proteinase was greater than 95% active. For crystallization, purified hK5 in 0.2 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) was concentrated by pressure dialysis to 2.2 mg/ml, and 3 ml of this solution was added to a vial containing 5 mg of leupeptin. Loss in activity was 95% after 100 min of incubation at 25 °C. SDS­PAGE analysis of a sample of leupeptin-inhibited hK5 left overnight at room temperature showed a single band at 30 kDa with no evidence of degradation. Measurement of leupeptin and Zn2+ inhibition constants Increasing concentrations of leupeptin were reacted with 30 nM hK5 at 25 °C in 250 l total volume of 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 9%(w/v) Me2SO, and 0.5 mM Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA. The fractional activity (vi/ v0) was determined at seven different leupeptin concentrations ranging from 0.3 M to 30 M with 90% inhibition at the highest concentration. In each measurement, the proteinase was pre-incubated in substrate solution for 2 min to obtain an initial activity (v0), after which stock leupeptin (1­10 l) was added to the assay and activity monitored further until a new steady-state activity (vi) was obtained (about 2 min). A plot of vi/v0 as a function of total leupeptin concentration (I0) was hyperbolic; to obtain the inhibition equilibrium constant (Ki), data were fit to the relationship: vi =v0 ¼ ðKM þ ½SÞ=KM ð1 þ ½I0 Þ þ ½S ð1Þ

Crystallization and data collection Using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method, native hK5 crystals were grown at 18 °C from drops containing 2 l protein solution (12 mg/ml hK5), 10 mM leupeptin and 2 l of precipitant (0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Mes (pH 5.6) and 30% (w/v) PEG-monomethyl ether 500), equilibrated against 500 l of precipitant solution. These crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2 and have one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1). For preparation of hK5-Zn crystals, these crystals were soaked for 2 min in the mother liquor, with 10 mM ZnCl2 added. The hK5-Zn-free crystals were made by soaking the native crystals with a mother liquor, that contained 10 mM picolinc acid. Upon soaking, these crystals maintained their symmetry, but slightly changed their cell dimensions (see Table 1). These crystals were mounted undera nitrogen gas stream (100K), and data sets were collected to 2.8 Å and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively, using a 165 mm MAR CCD detector (MAR Research, Norderstedt) at beam line BW6 of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany (Table 1). All data were evaluated with the DENZO package and loaded and scaled using SCALEPACK from the CCP4i program suite (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 interface, 1994). For the determination of the orientation and position of the hK5 molecule in the crystals, rotational and translational searches were performed with PHASER, using the co-ordinates of hK428 as a model. The crystallographic refinement was done in several cycles consisting of model building performed with MAIN54 and conjugate gradient minimization and simulated annealing using CNS.55 Subsequently the leupeptin inhibitor was modeled and built into the structure using MAIN, with subsequent energy refinement made with CNS. In the final model building cycles, water molecules were inserted at stereochemically reasonable sites, and individual isotropic atomic B-values were refined. In the final model, the whole hK5 main-chain is defined by appropriate electron density. Only for a very few side-chains projecting out into solution and partially undefined by electron density, the occupancy was set to zero. A total of 5.0% of all reflections were omitted from refinement, resulting in final R-factors and R-frees of 21.0/22.1 and 23.6/ 26.5%, respectively (Table 1). In the Ramachandran plot, 87.3/83.2% of all non-Gly and non-Pro residues are found in most favored regions and 12.2/14.3% in additionally allowed regions. Modeling experiments (for His57 rotation) were performed interactively in MAIN. Figures of charged molecular surfaces were created with GRASP56 and of protein structures with PyMOL. Protein Data Bank accession codes The atomic co-ordinates have been deposited at the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the accession numbers 2PSX and 2PSY.

which assumes competitive inhibition. The KM for Bz-ProPhe-Arg-NA hydrolysis at pH 8.0 is much greater than 1.0 mM, thus under our experimental conditions equation (1) simplifies considerably to: ðvi =v0 ¼ 1=ð1 þ ½I0 =Ki Þ ð2Þ

Zn2+ inhibition of hK5 at three different pH values were determined using procedures similar to that just described for leupeptin inhibition, employing the photometric substrate Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA at concentrations below KM (0.2 KM, 0.2 KM and b0.2 KM at pH 5.5, 7.0 and 8.0. respectively). Plots of fractional activity versus Zn2+ concentration were hyperbolic and Ki values were estimated by fitting the data to equation (2), which also applies to classical non-competitive inhibition. The buffers used at pH 5.5, 7.0, and 8.0, were Mes, Mops and Tris, respectively. In addition, Zn2+ inhibition was also determined fluorimetrically employing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 40 M imidazole, 0.005%(v/v) Tween-20 (pH 7.0), 40 M of the fluorimetric substrates H-Pro-Phe-Arg7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC), Tos-Gly-Pro-ArgAMC and H-Gly-His-Arg-AMC (Bachem), 0.5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 22 nM hK5, and using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 nm and
