Abstract

Shikimate kinase from Erwinia ch~santhemi, overexpressed in Escherichia coli has been crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method using sodium chloride as a precipitant. Mass spectrometry was used to confirm the purity of the shikimate kinase and dynamic light scattering was used to assess conditions for the monodispersity of the enzyme. The crystals are tetragonal, space group P412~2 or enantiomorph with cell dimensions a = b--- 108.5 and c = 92.8 A (at 100 K). Native crystals diffract to better than 2.6,~, on a synchrotron X-ray source. The asymmetric unit is likely to contain two molecules, corresponding to a packing density of 3.6 ~3 Da-i.

extended to a common core structure for ATP/GTP binding proteins. The SK of E. chrysanthemi which was cloned and sequenced by Minton, Whitehead, Atkinson & Gilbert (1989) is a type II enzyme sharing 53% amino-acid sequence identity with the E. coli SKII. Matsuo & Nishikawa (1994) have predicted that E. coli SKII has the same fold as porcine adenylate kinase, despite the low degree of sequence similarity (19% identity).
2. Methods and results

1. Introduction

The shikimate pathway is essential to plants and microorganisms for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, but is absent from animals. The enzymes of this pathway are, therefore, targets for the development of potentially nontoxic antimicrobial agents (Davies et al., 1994) and herbicides (Coggins, 1989). Shikimate kinase (SK, E.C. 2.7.1.71) catalyses the fifth reaction in the pathway converting shikimate into its phosphorylated derivative, shikimate 3-phosphate, using ATP as a co-substrate. This reaction is catalysed by two different isoforms, a type I enzyme (SKI) and a type II enzyme (SKII). It is unusual for there to be two isoenzymes in the middle of a metabolic pathway, therefore it has been proposed that shikimate may be a branch-point intermediate for two different pathways (Weiss & Edwards, 1980). The gene for SKII has been cloned and overexpressed from E. coli and the enzyme was found to be a monomer (De Feyter & Pittard, 1986a; Millar, Lewendon, Hunter & Coggins, 1986). Recently, the gene encoding SKI from E. coli has also been identified (LobnerOlsen & Marinus, 1992; Whipp & Pittard, 1995). SKII appears to play a dominant role in the shikimate pathway, (De Feyter, Davidson & Pittard, 1986) whilst the role of SKI is much less clear, as the enzyme has a much lower affinity for shikimate (KM of 20 mM compared with 200 l.tM for SKII) (De Feyter & Pittard, 1986b). It has been suggested that SKI may have another function in the cell and that it phosphorylates shikimate only fortuitously (De Feyter & Pittard, 1986b). This is consistent with the recent observation that SKI is associated with sensitivity to the antibiotic mecillinam which clearly implies an alternative biological role for SKI (Vinella, Gagny, Joseleau-Petit, D'Ari & Cashel, 1996). Both SKI and SKII contain the type A Walker motif (Walker, Saraste, Runswick & Gay, 1982) which is shared by many ATPand GTP-binding proteins. It has been speculated by MilnerWhite, Coggins & Anton (1991) that this motif could be © 1997 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved

2.1. En~me purification and mass spectrometric analysis Shikimate kinase from E. chrysanthemi was overexpressed in E. coli BL2 I(DE3)pLysS to an amount of 30-40% of the total cellular protein using a T7 RNA polymerase expression system (Studier & Moffatt, 1986). The cells (14 g) suspended in 20 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 20 mM KCI, 5 mM MgCI2 and 0.4 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (buffer A) were broken by two passes through a French pressure cell operated at 6.9MPa. This material was then diluted with 80 ml buffer A and centrifuged at 100 000g for 1 h. SK was purified from the resulting cell-free extract. All subsequent steps were performed at 277 K. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel anionexchange column (25 x 2.1 cm diameter, flow rate of 20 ml h --1) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was then washed with the same buffer until the A28onm of the eluate was less than 0.3. SK was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-300 mM KCI in 800 ml of buffer A (flow rate 4 0 m l h -1) and fractions (14ml) collected and assayed as described in Millar et al. (1986). Pooled fractions were made up to 1.2M (NH4)2SO4 by addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction column (10 × 1.1cm diameter, flow rate of 10mlh -1) equilibrated in 100mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mM DTT (buffer B) containing 1.2 M (NH4)2504. The column was then washed with 50 ml of buffer B containing 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4, and SK was eluted with a linear gradient (200 ml) of 1.2-0.0 M (NH4)2SO4 in buffer B. The flow rate was 10mlh -1 and 4ml fractions were collected and assayed. Fractions containing SK activity were pooled and concentrated by vacuum dialysis. At this stage a substantial amount of enzyme was lost due to its irreversible precipitation. The concentrated enzyme solution was dialysed against 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 500raM KCI, 0.4mM DTT and l O%(v/v) glycerol (buffer C) and applied to a Sephacryl $200 (superfine grade) column (85 × 2.5 cm diameter, flow rate of 8 ml h-1) that had been equilibrated with buffer C. The enzyme was eluted with buffer C (flow rate 8 ml h- ~, 4 ml fractions). Fractions containing SK activity were dialysed against buffer A containing 50%(v/v) glycerol before long-term storage at 253 K. Acta Crystallographica Section D ISSN 0907-4449 © 1997

SHORT COMMUNICATIONS Mass spectrometry was performed on a VG Platform quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with a pneumatically assisted electrospray source (VG Biotech Ltd, Altrincham, Cheshire, UK). For experimental details see Krell, Pitt & Coggins (1995). The protein to be crystallized was shown to be of high purity using electrospray mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). Two different enzyme species were detected which corresponded to fulllength enzyme (60%) and another species where the N-terminal methionine had been cleaved off (40%). This heterogeneity can be explained by a lack of complete processing of the enzyme by the cell due to the very high level of overexpression. 2.2. Dynamic light scattering Experiments were carried out using a DYNA-PRO 801 dynamic light-scattering/molecular-sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, Buckinghamshire, UK). Protein solutions (1 mg m1-1) were in 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.6. Dynamic lightscattering experiments were carried out in parallel with crystallization trials to assess conditions for the monodispersity of the enzyme. Several conditions were tried (Table 1), however, it was shown that monodispersity could only be achieved in the presence of the substrate shikimate, ADP and MgC12. Under those conditions the estimated molecular weight obtained, 18 kDa, was consistent with a monomeric state for the enzyme in solution. Furthermore, the solubility of the enzyme was found to be greatly increased in the presence of shikimate, ADP and MgC12 (from 5 mg ml-] in buffer to at least 70 mg ml-]). In the light of these results crystallization trials were carried out in the presence of these compounds. 2.3. Crystallization A wide variety of crystallization conditions were tested using sparse-matrix screens (Jancarik & Kim, 1991). Crystallizations were performed at room temperature using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion technique. The enzyme was dialysed exhaustively into 20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.6. Shikimate and ADP (freshly made up solution in water, pH adjusted to 7.6) were added at a final concentration of 5 mM

and MgC12 to a final concentration of 10 mM. Enzyme was concentrated using Centricon-10 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, UK) to a concentration of 16 mg m1-1. Initial crystals were obtained from condition 36 of the Hampton Research crystal screen II (Cudney, Patel, Weisgraber, Newhouse & McPherson, 1994). These crystallization conditions were optimized to 2.16 M sodium chloride, 100mM Hepes buffer, pH 6.9. Typically, 6~tl of protein (16 mg m1-1) were mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution. Crystals appear after 10-12 d and continue to grow as tetragonal bipyramids up to a maximum size of 0.7 × 0.2 x 0.2 mm (Fig. 2). 2.4. X-ray analysis The X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline 7.2 at the SRS Daresbury Laboratory using a wavelength of 1.44 ~, and a MAR Research imaging-plate system. The crystals were radiation sensitive, therefore cryo-cooling was essential.

Mass Fig. 1. MaxEnt deconvolution mass spectra of recombinant shikimate kinase from Erwinia chrysanthemi. MaxEnt spectra can be used for a semi-quantitative analysis by comparing integrated peak areas (Ferrige, Seddon, Green, Jarvis & Skilling, 1992). The crystallized protein was heterogeneous: the peak with the molecular weight (Mr) of 18 955 confirms the theoretical Mr of 18 955.85 as deduced from the nucleotide sequence (Minton et al., 1989). The peak with Mr of 18824 corresponds to enzyme species with the N-terminal methionine residue cleaved off (mass difference of 131). The small peaks to the right of the major peaks are potassium adducts (mass difference 39).

The polydispersity value indicates the standard deviation of the spread of particle sizes about the reported average radius. A rise in polydispersity in relation to the average radius represents greater spread in the size distribution.

A native data set to 2.6 A resolution was collected using 1° oscillation frames. Data were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). From autoindexing by DENZO the crystals were found to belong to the tetragonal crystal system, with unit-cell dimensions of a = b = 108.5 and c = 9 2 . 8 A . Analysis of the systematic absences in the data revealed absences at h = 2 and l = 4n along the (h00) and (00D axes, respectively, which are consistent with the space group of P412x2 or enantiomorph (Fig. 3). An assumption of two molecules per asymmetric unit leads to an acceptable packing density, Vm of 3.6A 3 Da -~, corresponding to a solvent content of 66% (Matthews, 1968). Interestingly, the self-rotation function gives no indication of a non-crystallographic twofold axis. Repeated attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement with AMoRe (Navaza, 1990), using porcine adenylate kinase as a search model, were unsuccessful. We are currently using multiple isomorphous replacement methods to solve the structure.
