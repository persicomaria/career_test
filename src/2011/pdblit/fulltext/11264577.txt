Radiation damage is an inherent problem in protein X-ray crystallography and the process has recently been shown to be highly speci®c, exhibiting features such as cleavage of disul®de bonds, decarboxylation of acidic residues, increase in atomic B factors and increase in unit-cell volume. Reported here are Ê two trypsin structures at atomic resolution (1.00 and 0.95 A), the data for which were collected at a third-generation synchrotron (ESRF) at two different beamlines. Both trypsin structures exhibit broken disul®de bonds; in particular, the bond from Cys191 to Cys220 is very sensitive to synchrotron radiation. The data set collected at the most intense beamline (ID14-EH4) shows increased structural radiation damage in terms of lower occupancies for cysteine residues, more breakage in the six disul®de bonds and more alternate conformations. It appears that high intensity and not only the total X-ray dose is most harmful to protein crystals.

1. Introduction
The lifetime of cryogenically cooled protein crystals exposed to synchrotron radiation has decreased using the new thirdgeneration beamlines with insertion devices. The new beamlines are so intense that the proteins suffer badly from radiation damage; during routine data collection, loss of diffraction quality and increased sample mosaicity are often observed. In 1988, when cryocooling of crystals became feasible (Hope, 1988), the problem of radiation damage was generally thought to be eliminated. The lifetime of cryocooled crystals was improved spectacularly; however, Gonzalez et al. (1992) were the ®rst to describe radiation damage in cryocooled crystals. Several investigators have tried to unravel details of the radiation-damage process (Gonzalez & Nave, 1994; Hedman et al., 1985; Helliwell, 1988; Nave, 1995) and until recently radiation damage was believed to be a nonspeci®c problem. Recent reports have given a better understanding of the problem (Teng & Moffat, 2000) and radiationdamage studies have all described the damage to be highly speci®c, e.g. on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL), a chymotrypsin inhibitor (Weik et al., 2000; Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000) and myrosinase (Burmeister, 2000). All investigators have performed comprehensive studies by collecting consecutive data sets on protein crystals; between each data set the crystals were left unexposed, exposed to attenuated beam or exposed to the monochromatic (unattenuated) full beam. Comparison of successive data sets revealed an increase in atomic B factors, increased unit-cell parameters, slight rotation and translation of the protein molecules, breakdown of disul®de bridges and decarboxylation of aspartic and glutamic acids. It was postulated

that the changes are initiated by free radicals formed during X-ray exposure and that the absorbed X-ray dose needed to form radicals can be reached during routine data collection. Burmeister (2000) also reported speci®c damage (loss in electron density) to the hydroxyl groups of tyrosine and the methylthiol groups of methionine residues. The aims of these studies have been to understand the details of radiation damage, since it introduces non-isomorphism that can hamper phasing methods such as multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD). The number of structures at atomic resolution is increasing rapidly; they have been used to provide detailed structure information on, for example, the position of the H atom on the È catalytic histidine of elastase (Wurtele et al., 2000) and subtilisin (Kuhn et al., 1998), the role of CÐHÁ Á ÁO interactions in -sheets and deviations from well accepted dictionaries such as the Engh & Huber parameters (Ridder et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 1998). High-resolution structures can also give new details that are valuable for drug designers. In the present study, we describe the structures of coldadapted anionic salmon trypsin and bovine trypsin, which Ê have previously been re®ned to 1.83 and 1.34 A, respectively Ê (PDB codes 1bit and 5ptp, respectively; Berglund, Smalas et al., 1995; Finer-Moore et al., 1992). The present structures are Ê re®ned to atomic resolution, 1.00 and 0.95 A, respectively. One data set was collected at an insertion-device beamline, ID14-EH4, while the other was collected on a bending-magnet beamline, the Swiss±Norwegian Beamline (SNBL), both at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. The observed radiation damage in both structures is described along with other ®ndings. Trypsin has been chosen as a model system because crystals are easy to obtain and diffract to high resolution. The enzyme also has six disul®de bonds, which is more than any of the other proteins used so far in radiation-damage studies. were stored at room temperature. The crystal had dimensions of roughly 0.15 Â 0.3 Â 0.4 mm and the cryoprotectant was the reservoir solution with addition of 15% glycerol.
2.2. Data collection and processing

2. Experimental
2.1. Crystallization

Crystals of anionic salmon trypsin (AST) with benzamidine were grown by the hanging-drop method with only minor changes from the previously described conditions for AST Ê Ê crystal form II (Berglund, Smalas et al., 1995; Smalas et al., 1990). The initial protein solution contained 20 mg mlÀ1 protein and 60 mM benzamidine. The reservoir solution contained 0.7±0.8 M ammonium sulfate and 0.05 M citrate buffer pH 5.8 and the crystals were grown at 310 K. The crystal used for data collection had approximate dimensions of 0.15 Â 0.2 Â 0.3 mm and was ¯ash-cooled in the reservoir solution containing 30% glycerol. The bovine trypsin (BT) with aniline was also grown from a hanging drop, with the reservoir solution consisting of 25% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 8 and 0.1 M aniline (Kurinov & Harrison, 1994). The drops were produced by mixing 5 ml protein solution at 15 mg mlÀ1 with 5 ml reservoir solution and the trays

Both data sets were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, but at two different beamlines; the procedures will be described for both experimental setups. Data from AST with benzamidine were collected at ID14-EH4 at ESRF with an ADSC CCD detector from a single crystal cooled to 100 K. Data were collected with a crystal-to-detector distance of 120 mm, a detector offset height of 60 mm, 0.5 oscillation, 2 s exposure time and a total of 208 frames. The crystal was exposed at a second place to retain the highest resolution possible and 180 new frames were Ê collected to 1.4 A. Data for BT were collected at the Swiss±Norwegian Beamline (SNBL) at 120 K from one single crystal on a MAR345 image-plate detector. First, one high-resolution data Ê set was collected to 0.95 A with a crystal-to-detector distance  of 140 mm, 1 oscillation, a dose corresponding to 45 s exposure and a total of 150 images. The low-resolution data set was Ê taken from the same crystal to a maximum of 1.5 A, a dose  corresponding to 4 s exposure, 2.5 oscillation per frame and 61 frames. The high-resolution data were collected with the largest MAR mode (345 mm diameter), whilst the lowresolution data set used the smallest mode available (180 mm diameter). All data sets were autoindexed and processed with DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993); scaling and merging were performed in SCALA from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). During the merging it became clear that the ®nal frames collected (about 90 in total) from AST did not merge very well with the rest of the data set; they were therefore omitted from the ®nal data set. AST had an Rmerge per frame of 5.2% (598 Ê re¯ections to 1.00 A) for the ®rst image and 9.8% (281 Ê re¯ections to 1.40 A) for the last frame used in the ®nal data set. The ®nal data is 76.5% complete, with an overall Rmerge of 4.9% (Table 1). In order to increase the overall completeness Ê we tried to incorporate previously collected data to 1.2 A, but Ê these data were clearly not isomorphous with the 1.00 A data set; therefore, only images from one crystal were used. The overall temperature factor estimated from the Wilson plot Ê (Wilson, 1942) was 8.61 A2. All frames collected for BT scaled well together with an Ê Rmerge of 7.4% (5200 re¯ections to 0.95 A) for the ®rst image Ê and 4.6% (2390 re¯ections to 1.5 A) for the last. The overall Rmerge was 4.8% and the overall B factor from the Wilson plot Ê was 7.94 A2. The completeness of 99.5% and the redundancy of 6.9 are considered to be satisfactory. See Table 1 for further details.
2.3. Molecular replacement and refinement

Initial phases for the ®rst map of AST were obtained by molecular replacement in AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using the

The resulting Crowther and an integration radius of 20 A angles and fractional translation vectors were  = 30.20,  = 3.11,  = 327.77 , Tx = À0.0712, Ty = 0.0214, Tz = 0.1554. The BT phases were obtained from a re®ned structure of BT Ê with benzylamine (Brandsdal & Smalas, unpublished work), only improved by rigid-body re®nement. The initial re®nement included simulated annealing (3000 K) and conjugate-gradient minimization in X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992), accompanied by conjugate-gradient leastsquares minimization with SHELXL (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). All atoms were re®ned with anisotropic B factors, but were restrained toward the atomic bond directions (DELU command) and according to their bond distance (SIMU command). Some residues (21 in AST and eight in BT) were re®ned with double conformations. At the very end of the re®nements, rigid H atoms were added to the models, but not to the hydroxyl groups of Ser, Thr and Tyr, and not to the N atoms of the His side chains. All data were included in the ®nal round. Solvent molecules were added to the models when the difference density exceeded 3.5'. Subsequent cycles of re®nement and manual adjustments in O (Jones et al., 1991) were performed with ' A-weighted Fo À Fc and 2Fo À Fc maps (Read, 1986); 5% of the data were reserved for cross validation using the free R factor. The Ramachandran plots (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) show 77.2 and 71.4% of residues in the inner core of the allowed regions of AST and BT, respectively, compared with the expected value of 80% (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996). Outliers in AST are Asn115 and Ser214, while Asp71 and Ser214 fall outside the expected regions in BT. The expected value of the main-chain 3 angle is 180 , but the distributions of the angle (Fig. 1) show that the values are not symmetrical around 180 . The highest deviation for BT is

21.7 for Glu70, a residue bound to the calcium ion, which is well de®ned in the electron-density maps. The mean value of the 3 angle is 179.33 for AST and 178.80 for BT. Deviations from the ideal value of 180 for the 3 angle are not uncommon in high-resolution structures (Ridder et al., 1999; Walsh et al., 1998; Wilson et al., 1998).

respectively; the higher number in the former is a consequence of the greater number (21) of alternate conformations. The ®nal R values of both trypsins are less than 12% and Rfree is 14.9 and 14.0%, respectively (Table 2). The active sites are occupied by an inhibitor, benzamidine in AST and aniline in BT, and both models have one calcium ion in the calciumbinding loop. The number of solvent molecules incorporated as water molecules is 228 (AST) and 255 (BT), while there are three sulfate molecules and one glycerol in BT, and one sulfate and a second benzamidine in the AST structure. The position of the second benzamidine in AST is the same as the glycerol in BT. The benzamidine of AST stacks almost parallel to Phe82 and is adjacent to the symmetry-related Tyr217 and Tyr172. In BT, one of the glycerol O atoms is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain N atom of Phe82. The common sulfate ion in the two structures is in the `oxyanion hole' as observed for a number of other trypsin and elastase structures (see Schrùder et al., 1998, and references therein). Some sulfates are re®ned with reduced occupancy. The occupancy of the calcium ion in the AST structure was re®ned to 0.65 since negative difference electron density was observed at the calcium position. The two structures superimpose very well, except for the known conformational difference of residues 145±153 in the Ê autolysis loop (Smalas et al., 1994), with an r.m.s. deviation for Ê main-chain atoms of 0.65 A excluding residues 145±153. In AST, residues 23±26 are poorly de®ned and the main-chain Ê atoms of residues 24 and 25 are shifted about 3 A relative to the BT structure. The side chain of Tyr25 is well de®ned in the AST density and the conformational shift seems to arise from aromatic interactions between Tyr25 and a symmetry-related Tyr39. The difference density observed in this area of AST can probably be explained by the high ¯exibility or multiple chain conformations of residues 23±26. The number of atoms with zero occupancy is 37 in AST and 21 in BT; the higher number in the former is caused by loss of density for the last two residues of the C-terminal -helix as in all other Ê AST structures (Berglund, Smalas et al., 1995; Helland, Berglund et al., 1999; Helland et al., 1998; Ê Smalas et al., 1994). The BT structure, which has the highest number of unique re¯ections and the lowest estimated coordinate error (Table 2), also has the highest deviation from the Engh and Huber Figure 2 parameters (Engh & Huber, 1991) used in the 1 2 The catalytic hydrogen bond from His57 N to Asp102 O in anionic salmon trypsin re®nement.

Ê AST. For comparison, the 1.15 A structure of haloalkane dehalogenase reported by Ridder et al. (1999) possesses r.m.s. deviations of Ê 0.014 and 0.029 A for bond lengths and angle Ê distances, respectively, and HEWL at 0.95 A Ê (bonds) possesses r.m.s. deviations of 0.017 A Ê and 0.044 A (angles) (Walsh et al., 1998). The position of a H atom on the catalytic histidine has been reported in porcine È pancreatic elastase (Wurtele et al., 2000) and in Bacillus lentus subtilisin (Kuhn et al., 1998). In the case of AST, we were able to localize the position of the HN1 atom at 2.5' in the difference density map (Fig. 2). The distance from the maximum of the peak to His57 N1 is Ê 1.00 A, whereas His57 N1 and Asp102 O2 Ê are separated by 2.69 A and the angle 1 1 2  N ÐHN ÐO is 159 . These numbers are similar to those reported for the porcine È elastase (Wurtele et al., 2000). The presence of His57 HN1 in BT is less obvious, but one hydrogen site could be assigned to Ser214 O in the direction of Asp102 O2. In acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the active-site His440 is the histidine residue most affected by X-ray radiation. Weik et al. (2000) concluded that active-site residues are among the most radiation-sensitive residues, as their conformation often constitutes `weak lines' or `strained' con®gurations in protein structures. This does not seem to be the case for our trypsin structures, since all the residues in the catalytic triads are well de®ned in the electron-density maps.
3.2. Salt bridges

The conformational difference of the autolysis loop (residues 145±153) enables AST to form three unique ion-pair interactions involving residues Asp150, Lys154, Glu21 and His71, of which Glu21, Asp150 and Lys154 were found to be residue determinants for the cold-adapted ®sh trypsins (Leiros et al., 1999). The ion-pair network has been pointed out to be a cold-adaptation determinant (Leiros et al., 2000). In the cryocooled AST structure presented here, all residues involved are well de®ned in the electrondensity map (Fig. 3a) and the distance from Ê Lys154 N to Asp150 O2 is 4.46 A and from

Ê Lys154 N to Glu21 O41 is 4.84 A, while it is Ê from Glu21 O42 to His71 N42. The 2.69 A two interactions involving Lys154 are Ê beyond the cutoff criteria of 4.0 A which is often used to de®ne salt bridges; however, bearing in mind the long-range nature of electrostatic interactions, some stabilizing interactions still occur. The network connects the autolysis loop (residues 150 and 154) to the N-terminal loop (Glu21) and the N-terminal loop to the calcium-binding loop (His71) as illustrated in Fig. 3(b); this could stabilize the catalytically active trypsin. The network is very pH-dependent and could explain why the cold-adapted Â trypsins are unstable at low pH (Asgeirsson et al., 1989; Genicot et al., 1988; Outzen et al., 1996).
3.3. Disulfide bridges

Figure 4 (continued)
Acta Cryst. (2001). D57, 488±497

All the recent studies on the speci®c nature of X-ray radiation damage (Weik et al., 2000; Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000; Burmeister, 2000) reported an increase in B factors for cysteines, glutamic acids and aspartic acids for successive data sets of the proteins investigated. The increase in B factors for cysteines is caused by the breakage of disul®de bonds. A clear ordering of the disul®de bonds in terms of susceptibility to radiation damage was also observed; additionally, within each disul®de bond, one S atom seemed to be more labile whilst the other remained in the same position. In the two trypsin structures presented here, none of the six disul®de bridges in AST have both cysteine residues re®ned with full occupancy, whereas three bridges in BT have both Cys residues with full occupancy, namely 22±57, 136±201 and 168±182 (Table 3). Four of the 12 cysteines in AST are in an alternate conformation and nine of the 12 S atoms have reduced occupancy, while BT has two double conformations and six S atoms with reduced occupancy (Figs. 4a and 4b). There is some correlation between high water-accessible surface area (WAS) and reduced occupancy (Table 3). All S atoms in both models with full occupancy are totally buried with a WAS of 0 and all S Ê atoms (except one) with WAS ! 1 A2 have reduced occupancies of 0.90±0.65. The Cys191±Cys220 disul®de bridge is partly disordered in both trypsin structures

The disul®de bridge Cys168±Cys182 in AST has alternate conformations for residue 168 but also has one large positive peak in the difference electron-density map (Fig. 5). If this extra density had been assigned as a water molecule, it would Ê Ê have been 3.7 A from the S on Cys168 but only 1.8 A from  the S in the second conformation. The role and nature of this solvent molecule is not clear. In AST some additional electron density is seen near Cys58 S (Fig. 4a), but no second conformation could be assigned to this position. Also, the extra density at Cys22 and Cys136 indicates some movements or cleavage of these bridges. In BT, Cys42 has a slight indication of a second conformation, but no such indicators are seen for any of the other cysteines. The observation of one anchor and one separator within the bridge (Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000) is not clearly seen from our results. For BT, both cysteines within a bridge are either fully occupied or both have reduced occupancy, while in AST some anchors could be assigned. AST has four bridges, with one cysteine in a second conformation; the remaining cysteines could then be denoted the anchors. This is valid for Cys42±Cys58(A), Cys168±Cys182(A) and Cys191(A)±Cys220, where A indicates anchor.
3.4. Loss of definition

² S atom only.

The speci®c radiation damage has been reported as loss in de®nition of the carboxyl groups of aspartic and glutamic acid residues and also the loss of the hydroxyl groups of tyrosine and the methylthiol groups of methionine residues (Burmeister, 2000; Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000; Weik et al., 2000). In our structures, AST has reduced occupancy for Tyr20 C and O and Glu77 C, O41 and O42, occupancy 0.8 for Asp236 O2, Met104 C, Met135 S, Met175 S, occupancy zero for Glu49 C, Glu186 O41 and O42, and high B factors Ê (>30 A2) for Met145 C4, Met175 C4, Tyr184 O and Tyr217 O. BT has poorly de®ned carboxyl groups (occupancy zero) for Asp153, C and O41 of Glu186, whereas Asp165 has occupancy 0.6 for the carboxyl group. Met104 has one alternate conformation. Residues that could be decarboxylated in AST are Glu77 and Glu186 and in BT are Asp153 and Glu186. The calcium ion of AST has occupancy 0.65, as already mentioned, and one of the ligands, Glu77, is poorly de®ned in the electron-density map. The carboxyl group of Glu77 has reduced occupancy (0.64±0.88), the density of the side chain is poorer compared with the other ligands and the nearby residue Ser79 has two conformations (Fig. 6a). A comparison of room-temperature AST (PDB Ê code 1bit; Berglund, Smalas et al., 1995) and cryocooled AST shows that the calcium-binding mode, the ligands and Ser79 (main conformation) Figure 5 superimpose very well. In the room-temperature The disul®de bridge Cys168±Cys182 in anionic salmon trypsin (AST) and the structure, Tyr25 O is hydrogen bonded to uninterpretable density near the second conformation of Cys168. The 2mFo À DFc Ê map is contoured at 1.5' (blue) and the mFo À DFc map at 4' (green) and À4' (red). Ser79 O (2.93 A) and Tyr25 O is at a distance and the bridge is also weakly de®ned in other trypsin structures re®ned in our group (R. Helland, personal communication; Helland, Otlewski et al., 1999). The bridge connects the two walls of the speci®city pocket of trypsin and the bridge is the second most water-exposed bridge in the structure. The most exposed connection is Cys128±Cys232, which bridges the beginning of the C-terminal -helix and the interdomain loop (see Leiros et al., 1999, for nomenclature).

Ê of 4.5 A from the carboxyl O atoms of Glu77. These interactions are not possible in the cryocooled AST as the N-terminal Ê loop has moved and the OH group of Tyr25 is shifted 9 A relative to the room-temperature structure (Fig. 6b). In the cryocooled structure Glu77 becomes more exposed to the solvent with higher WAS, it is more poorly de®ned and it seems more sensitive to radiation damage and decarboxylation. A decarboxylation can further expel the calcium binding, since Glu77 is one of the calcium-binding ligands; this might explain the low occupancy (0.65) for the calcium ion.
3.5. Dose calculations

The typical ¯ux at ID14-EH4 has been found to be of the order of 5 Â 1012 photons sÀ1 through a pinhole collimator with diameter of 0.15 mm, whereas the ¯ux at SNBL would be of the order of 1 Â 1012 photons sÀ1 for a 0.5 Â 0.5 mm focal

spot. Using the crystal dimensions 0.15 Â 0.2 Â 0.3 mm for AST and 0.15 Â 0.3 Â 0.4 mm for BT and the densities of the crystals, we can calculate the absorbed dose as described by Ravelli & McSweeney (2000). The doses absorbed are 6 Â 107 Gy (J kgÀ1) for AST and 7 Â 106 Gy for BT (Table 1). In comparison, the absorbed dose per data set for HEWL was 105 Gy (with attenuated beam) and 106 Gy (without attenuator), 107 Gy for AChE and 106 Gy for the chymotrypsin inhibitor (Weik et al., 2000; Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000), and 2.5 Â 1012 photons mmÀ2 ($1.1 Â 105 Gy) for myrosinase (Burmeister, 2000). Henderson (1990) estimated that cooled protein crystals could absorb a dose of 2 Â 107 Gy before the crystalline diffraction would be destroyed. New experiments on HEWL have shown that when the crystal is exposed to a dose which exceeds 1 Â 107 Gy the linear relation of dose to increased B factors, dose to increase in unit-cell volume or dose to decrease in intensities is lost. When the dose exceeds this threshold, secondary and perhaps tertiary radiation-damage effects become more signi®cant (Teng & Moffat, 2000). For both structures presented here the dose is of the order of 1 Â 107 Gy and secondary radiation-damage effects could be observed.

4. Conclusions
Synchrotron data for two trypsin structures have been collected at two different beamlines at ESRF in Grenoble, one at the insertion device of ID14-EH4 and the other at the bending magnet of SNBL (BM01). During the data collection it was clear that the crystal of anionic salmon trypsin (AST) exposed at ID14-EH4 suffered more from radiation damage than the bovine trypsin crystal (BT) exposed at SNBL. For BT, more of the unique re¯ections could be recorded from one single crystal, resulting in an overall completeness of 99.5%. AST lacks both low- and high-resolution data and has an overall completeness of 76.5%. Even at this early stage of the data collection and re®nement, it became clear that the trypsin crystal exposed at the insertiondevice beamline (ID14-EH4) suffered signi®cantly from the intense X-ray beam. Structural differences con®rmed the damage through a greater number of alternate conformations in AST (21) compared with BT (eight) and more breakages in the disul®de bridges. Both trypsins have six disul®de bridges and four of these have one cysteine residue with alternate conformations in AST, while in BT one disul®de bridge, Cys191±Cys220, is broken with both cysteines in dual conformations. From the remaining cysteines, AST has reduced occupancy for ®ve of the eight S atoms, while BT has lower occupancy for four of the ten S atoms.

The observed structural changes could be caused by primary radiation damage such as photoelectric absorption. The incoming X-ray photon is then absorbed and a lower level core electron is ejected from the atom. The photoabsorption by sulfur is 80 times higher than for carbon and nitrogen at the energies used in the experiment (Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000) and all sulfurs in the structures should be affected by the X-ray exposure. We observed only breakage of some disul®de bonds and low occupancy for two of the six methionines in AST and no change for the two methionines of BT. Since the S atoms are not affected equally, primary radiation damage alone can not explain the observed structural changes. When photoabsorption occurs in water, hydrated electrons (eÀ ), hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals are formed, with highest aq yields of the two former. When these species react with the protein, secondary radiation damage occurs. The hydrated electrons (eÀ ) have been found to react one to two orders of aq magnitude faster with cysteines compared with other amino acids (Favaudon et al., 1990). If the major source for eÀ is the aq solvent, the most water-exposed disul®de bonds should be the most susceptible to radiation damage. We found some correlation between high water-accessible surface and low occupancy for the S atoms in the cysteine residues, as also reported by Weik et al. (2000). Ravelli & McSweeney (2000) found no clear correlation and concluded that if electrons are a major cause of the speci®c radiation damage, the electrons must be mobile both within the protein and in the solvent. The disul®de bridges have been ordered of in terms of susceptibility (Weik et al., 2000; Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000). These authors questioned whether the order of bond breakage was related to the natural stability of the bonds and/or to the order in which they are formed during protein folding. This has been shown for HEWL, where the disul®de bond formed last in the folding process (van den Berg et al., 1999) is ranked second in terms of radiation-damage susceptibility. Our study should give the same order of weakness for the disul®de bonds in the two trypsin structures, but we can only rank Cys191± Cys220 as being the most fragile. This bond is re®ned with alternate conformations in both AST and BT and is broken in many other trypsin structures re®ned in our group. To our knowledge, there have not been any folding studies reported on trypsin which order the six disul®de bridges in the folding of the native enzyme and we therefore cannot correlate our observation to the folding process. The calculated X-ray dose which the crystals have been absorbing during the data collection was estimated to be 6 Â 107 Gy for AST and 7 Â 106 Gy for BT. These doses were obtained during 10 min exposure time for AST, while BT reached this dose during 1 h 50 min of data collection. The comparison of the structures from two different crystals at the two different beamlines then indicates that apart from the total X-ray dose the incoming photon ¯ux might also cause severe deterioration of protein crystals. Ê The 0.95 A structure of BT has the highest r.m.s. deviations compared with the Engh and Huber parameters (Engh & Huber, 1991), but the structure also has the highest fraction of re¯ections per protein atom and the lowest coordinate error and should therefore be the one most accurately de®ned. This supports the observations of Ridder et al. (1999) and Wilson et al. (1998) that atomic resolution structures deviate from what has generally been accepted as `ideal geometry'. It also demonstrates the necessity of reconsidering the currently used re®nement libraries. The fact that the number of atomic resolution structures is increasing and that many of the dictionaries are based on small-molecule structures and not protein structures also supports this action. Despite our hopes, the two last residues of the C-terminus of AST were not de®ned in this ®rst cryocooled structure of the enzyme. De®nition of the C-terminus would tell us whether the formation of two salt bridges from the Cterminal carboxyl group to Arg87 and Lys107 is possible, as found from the molecular-dynamic simulations (Heimstad et al., 1995) and in the crystal structures of BT. In other trypsin structures, there are two ion pairs from the C-terminal carboxyl group to Lys87 and Lys107 and these interactions stabilize the structure by binding the C-terminal -helix to the N-terminal barrel of the molecule. Since the ion pairs are not present in the cold-adapted AST and are also not found in the crystal structure of the cold-adapted salmon elastase (Berglund, Willassen et al., 1995), it might explain their reduced stability at elevated temperatures. The present comparative study shows that a higher amount of absorbed dose and high beam intensity yield more radiation damage such as broken disul®de bonds. Additional experiments are needed to obtain more details on the radiationdamage mechanism and also to ®nd experimental setups that will reduce the damage in the protein crystal. Crystal cooling in liquid helium (40 K) has been tried, but did not have any dramatic effect on the observed radiation damage (Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000; Yonath et al., 1998).
