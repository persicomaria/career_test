The crystal structure of human stefin A bound to an aminopeptidase, porcine cathepsin H, has been ° determined in monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal forms at 2.8 A and ° 2.4 A resolutions, respectively. The asymmetric unit of each form contains four complexes. The structures are similar to the stefin B ­papain complex, but with a few distinct differences. On binding, the N-terminal residues of stefin A adopt the form of a hook, which pushes away cathepsin H mini-chain residues and distorts the structure of the short four residue insertion (Lys155A ­Asp155D) unique to cathepsin H. Comparison with the structure of isolated cathepsin H shows that the rims of the cathepsin ° H structure are slightly displaced (up to 1 A) from their position in the free enzyme. Furthermore, comparison with the stefin B ­ papain complex ° showed that molecules of stefin A bind about 0.8 A deeper into the active site cleft of cathepsin H than stefin B into papain. The approach of stefin A to cathepsin H induces structural changes along the interaction surface of both molecules, whereas no such changes were observed in the stefin B ­ papain complex.

Introduction
Cathepsin H (EC 3.4.22.16) is a papain-like lysosomal cysteine protease. It exhibits primarily aminopeptidase activity by cleaving a single amino acid residue from the N terminus of a peptidyl substrate.1 Like cathepsins B, C and X, it is an exopeptidase unlike other homologous cathepsins, which are endopeptidases. Cathepsin H is, together with other lysosomal proteases, involved in intracellular protein degradation. When secreted, these enzymes can be very harmful for their environment, resulting in pathological conditions.2 Cathepsin H is involved in cancer,3 in Alzheimer's's disease4 and in genetic autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.5

Stefins and cystatins are the primary means of control of enzymatic activity of papain-like lysosomal cysteine proteases and like their target enzymes, are widely spread in animals, plants and microorganisms. Stefins are intracellular inhibitors, while cystatins are extracellular inhibitors found mainly in biological fluids such as saliva, tears and seminal plasma.6,7 Stefin A is found primarily in skin8 and in polymorphonuclear granulocytes,9 whereas stefin B has a more general distribution in the cytosol.8,10 Stefins are the first line of defense, primarily targeting endogenous proteases, whereas cystatins as well as stefin A can serve also as a defense mechanism against mistargeted molecules and intruders such as parasites.11 The importance of stefin B is demonstrated by a mutation, which results in stefin B deficiency and predisposes the individuals to a hereditary form of myoclonal epilepsy.12,13 Co-localization of stefins A and B and cystatin C with cathepsins B, H and L was observed in

876 myoclonal epilepsy,14 colorectal,15 prostatic16 and lung cancers,17 autoimmune diseases such as asthma18 and apoptosis.19 Stefins and cystatins are proteins with Mr values of 11 kDa and 13 kDa. Cystatins contain a 23 residue insertion with respect to stefins that is not involved in direct interactions with papain-like enzymes. Stefins and cystatins are rather non-selective inhibitors, able to discriminate only between endo- and exoproteases. They bind with 1:1 stoichiometry and high affinity to various members of the papain super family from both plant and mammalian tissues. Stefins inhibit endopeptidases in the picomolar range (Ki ¼ 0.05­ 130 pM) and exopeptidases in the nanomolar range (Ki ¼ 0.3 ­ 100 nM).7,10,20 Kinetic and structural data suggest that they dock into the active site cleft of a papainlike enzyme in the same orientation. The mechanism of interaction between a cystatin-type inhibitor and a lysosomal cysteine protease is based on the crystal structures of chicken egg-white cystatin21 docked to papain and the complex of human stefin B bound to carboxymethylated plant enzyme papain.22 Stefin B binds into the active site of the enzyme with a tripartite wedge constituted from N-terminal residues (described as "elephant" trunk),21 and the first (conserved QVVAG region) and second hairpin loops. The cystatin- and stefintype inhibitors bind in the active site cleft of papain-like endopeptidases, which are accessible along the whole length of the two-domain interface. In contrast, exopeptidases contain additional structural elements that restrict binding of substrate to certain parts of the active site cleft; their interactions with inhibitors have so far been unexplored. Building a model of the stefin B ­cathepsin H complex by replacing the papain molecule in the stefin B ­papain complex22 with the cathepsin H structure23 showed that residues from the elephant N-terminal trunk of stefin B and the mini-chain of cathepsin H overlap. The binding mode of cystatin-type inhibitors to aminopeptidase cathepsin H and, by analogy, cathepsin C, must differ from that of endopeptidases, because of the structural features built into the clefts of the former. Kinetic studies on cathepsin B and its mutants,24 ­ 26 and the structures of its zymogen27,28 showed that the cathepsin B occluding loop moves on binding of a protein inhibitor or its own propeptide. To investigate possible structural changes resulting from binding of a cystatin-type inhibitor to a lysosomal cysteine aminopeptidase, we have crystallized a complex of porcine cathepsin H with human stefin A and determined the structure of the 1:1 stoichiometric complex in two crystal forms, orthorhombic and monoclinic, ° ° diffracting to 2.4 A and 2.8 A, respectively. The crystal structure shows how the mini-chain residues, together with the short insertion loop (Lys155A ­ Asp155D) unique to cathepsin H, are pushed away on binding the N-terminal trunk of

° stefin A. Stefin A binds for about 0.8 A tighter to cathepsin H than stefin B to carboxymethylated papain, thereby revealing the genuine binding geometry of a cystatin-type inhibitor to a papainlike cysteine protease.

Results and Discussion
The asymmetric units of the monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal forms contain four stefin A ­ cathepsin H complexes. For stefin A the same chicken cystatin C numbering21 is used as applied to stefin B in the stefin B ­papain complex.22 Three inserted residues (Leu102A, Asn105A, Asp115A) are denoted by the letter A. The stefin A chain contains 98 residues from Met6 to Phe125. Stefins lack 23 residues between cystatin C residues 68 and 92, which makes Asp68 and Asn92 neighboring residues in stefin A. For cathepsin H, the papain numbering is used as already applied in the free enzyme structure.23 Cathepsin H contains 228 amino acid and three carbohydrate residues. There are 220 amino acid residues from Tyr1 to Val212A which make up the body of the enzyme and eight from Glu76P to Thr83P which constitute the mini-chain. The minichain residues are covalently attached to the body of the enzyme by the disulfide Cys80P ­Cys205. The main body of mature cathepsin H is found in one- and twochain forms, the latter being split into the heavy and light chains at Asn168B ­ Gly168C.29 Interestingly, the unbroken electron density map unambiguously defines the structure of the single chain cathepsin H as uncleaved in all four molecules in the monoclinic crystal form and in two molecules in the orthorombic crystal form, whereas the electron density map around the cleavage site of the other two cathepsin H molecules, in the orthorombic crystal form, has a clear break, indicating the two-chain form of the cathepsin H molecules. There are two N-glycosylation sites, Asn112 on the body of the enzyme and Asn79P on the mini-chain.30 Three carbohydrate rings attached to Asn112 are clearly visible in the electron density maps. The first two residues are N-acetylglucosamines (NAG 112A and NAG 112B) and the third is a b-mannose (BMA 112C). The carbohydrate residues are linked by 1­ 4 glycosidic bonds. The residues in all structures in crystal forms are well resolved by the electron density maps, the only exceptions in cathepsin H being residues from Lys155A to Asp155D, two C-terminal residues of the mini-chain Ala82P and Thr83P and a few side-chains. The last two mini-chain residues Ala82P and Thr83P are resolved in two structures in the monoclinic and in one in the orthorhombic crystal form. The structure of the Gln105 ­Asp107 loop in stefin A is not resolved in the monoclinic crystal form.

Overall structure Stefins are wedge-shaped molecules21,22,31 wide at one end and narrow at the other. Their fold is based on a five-stranded antiparallel b-sheet with propeller twist close to 908. The b-sheet surface is embraced on one side by a 20 residue long a-helix, bent along the whole width of the b-sheet and, on the other side by six C-terminal residues running antiparallel to the middle strand of the b-sheet. In the lower half of the stefin A structure, there are three loops forming the sharp edge of the wedge. These loops are actually two hairpins and the five N-terminal peptides bent in a form of a hook. Together they make up the interaction surface with the cathepsin H active site (Figures 1 and 2). Cathepsin H is folded in the typical papainlike two-domain structure.23 The left domain (L-domain) contains a central 30 residue long a-helix on which the active site Cys25 resides. The right domain (R-domain) is a b-barrel. (Left and right refer to the standard view used in Figure 1.) His159 is located at the edge of the b-barrel, opposite to Cys25. In front end of the V-shaped active site cleft, there are eight mini-chain residues, three visible carbohydrate rings and a short insertion loop (Lys155A ­ Asp155D), together responsible for the aminopeptidase activity of cathepsin H. These parts of cathepsin H have undergone the largest changes on inhibitor binding. Differences in the cathepsin H structures, apart from those parts

involved in direct interactions with the N-terminal trunk of stefin A, were also observed around the Asn168B­ Gly168C cleavage site. Superposition of the eight stefin A structures (four from each crystal form) on the averaged solution structure of stefin A31 and on the crystal structure of stefin B22 showed that there are 95 equivalently positioned CA atoms out of 98, result° ing in average RMS values of 0.88 A (individual ° to 0.89 A) and 0.75 A ° ° values ranging from 0.83 A ° to 0.82 A), ° (individual values ranging from 0.62 A respectively (Figure 3(a) and (b)). These differences

indicate that the crystal and solution structure of stefin A are essentially the same. Further comparison of the eight stefin A structures with the crystal structures of the stefin B ­ papain complex and free cathepsin H revealed interesting results. When stefin A structures were compared to the stefin B structure by optimizing the superposition of papain to cathepsin H structures, the averaged RMS differences between structures of stefin A ° and B were 1.37 A. These values were almost twice as large as those obtained by direct superposition, indicating that the positioning of stefin A

cathepsin H structure. In the absence of the structure of the complex of stefin B with the noncarboxymethylated papain, we can only suggest that the tighter fit observed in the structures of stefin A ­cathepsin H complexes is a consequence of an unblocked reactive site cysteine. Carboxymethylation of papain reduces the interaction constant (Kd) with cystatin by about three orders of magnitude (from 60 fM to 14 pM).32 Interactions within the active site cleft Stefin A binds with its narrow edge into the V-shaped active site cleft of cathepsin H (Figure 5(a) and (b)). There are no water molecules, within the active site cleft, mediating contacts between the cathepsin H and stefin A molecules. Its N terminus cannot bind along the active site cleft, as stefin B to papain, due to the presence of the mini-chain residues. Instead it makes a short turn in the form of a hook comprised of residues Met6, Ile7, Pro8 and Gly9. The side-chain of N-terminal Met6 points towards the first strand in the stefin A b-sheet, lengthening the hook. This brings the side-chain atoms into proximity with the insertion loop residues, actually in a position in which the ° Met6 CB atom would be within 2.5 A of the Asp155D carbonyl group, if it were in the same place as in the free cathepsin H structure. Residues Ile7 and Pro8 are placed in positions, which, in the structure of the free enzyme, are occupied by the C-terminal mini-chain residues Ala82P and Thr83P. In the complex these two residues are only poorly resolved in spite of the fact that the N-terminal amino group of stefin A and the C-terminal carboxylic group of the mini-chain lie ° within 4.5 A, which could lead to formation of a salt bridge. The substrate-like antiparallel ladder of hydrogen bonds between Thr83P­ Gly66 mainchain atoms observed in the free cathepsin H structure is replaced by a single hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Pro8 from stefin A and the amide of Gly66 from cathepsin H. The same pattern was observed in the structure of the inhibitory fragment of the p41 form of the invariant chain ( p41 fragment) bound to cathepsin L,33 where the p41 fragment residues Pro209 and

within the active site cleft of cathepsin H is noticeably different from that of papain bound to stefin B (Table 1). Thus, binding of stefin A to cathepsin H is tighter than binding of stefin B to papain. The ° hairpin loops of stefin A structures lie about 0.8 A closer to the bottom of the active site cleft than the hairpins of stefin B. Furthermore, visual inspection of the superposition of the eight structures of cathepsin H from the cathepsin H ­stefin A complex on the free enzyme structure,23 indicated that the parts of the papain-like structure of cathepsin H, which are not involved in direct interactions with the N-terminal trunk of stefin A, have also undergone some structural changes (Figure 4). The largest differences appear along the whole loop on the top of the cathepsin H R-domain from Val136 to Val157. In particular, the residues from Asn139 to Tyr144 forming the short helix on the right rim of the active site cleft are shifted by ° more than 1 A from their position in the free

Gly210, contributing to the base of the first binding loop in the p41 fragment ­ cathepsin L complex, superimpose on stefin A residues Pro8 and Gly9. The first hairpin loop of stefin A, the QVVAG region, binds in the same conformation as in the ° stefin B ­papain complex, although about 0.8 A deeper. Similarly, the second hairpin loop of stefin A gets closer to the surface of cathepsin H than stefin B to papain. It should be noted that this loop is only poorly resolved in the structures presented here. The C-terminal residue of stefin A

Phe125 interacts through water-mediated contact with the Asp92 of cathepsin H only in one of the eight complexes, suggesting that this contact observed also in the papain ­stefin B structure is not essential for binding of the two molecules. Besides the two C-terminal mini-chain residues Ala82P and Thr83P, whose position is taken by the stefin A hook, the remaining of the mini-chain residues are displaced from their position in the free enzyme structure (Figure 6). The only exception is Gln78P, which is anchored to the body of the

enzyme through its side-chain. Mini-chain residues still bind along the surface of the carbohydrate rings; however, on binding stefin A the whole mini-chain is pushed away from the active site cleft, resulting in an "S" shape bending instead of an extended chain conformation as observed in the free cathepsin H structure. Even the Cys80P, which is attached to the body of the enzyme by the disulfide bond (Cys205­ Cys80P), is pushed to the right (Figure 6). The short four-residue insertion (Lys155A ­ Asp155D), which forms a loop in the free enzyme structure, has to our surprise a disordered structure. This four-residue insertion is reminiscent of the cathepsin B occluding loop, which also exhibits flexibility on binding to the protein inhibitor24 ­ 27 and may like in the procathepsin B structure,28 exhibit flexibility during the transition of the procathepsin H structure to the mature enzyme structure. Relevance of N-terminal interactions with cathepsins Since binding of cystatin-type inhibitors to papain-like exopeptidases cannot be explained by the stefin B ­papain complex, the question is how does the stefin A ­cathepsin H complex enable us to explain interactions of various cystatin type inhibitors with cathepsin H and other aminopeptidases. The NMR structure of stefin A31 showed that the N-terminal region before Gly9 does not form any ordered structure. The conformation of the stefin A N terminus observed in the crystal structures of complexes with cathepsin H is thus induced by the formation of the complex. Deletion of ten N-terminal residues of chicken cystatin decreased inhibition for papain, cathepsins B and L for three to five orders of magnitude, demonstrating the relevance of N-terminal binding for complex formation.34 In endopeptidases cathepsin L and papain, formation of the ordered structure of the N-terminal region is subsequent to the docking of the two hairpin loops, whereas in carboxydipeptidase cathepsin B the sequence of binding steps is reversed.35,36 As, in cathepsin H there is no such feature, as the occluding loop of cathepsin B, which would stand in the way of the two hairpin loops, it can be assumed that stefins bind to cathepsin H following the pattern of endopeptidases. It seems obvious that the influence of N-terminal chain length and composition is stronger than in the cases of endopeptidases, where the effect of N-terminal chain truncation before Ile7 is negligible.37,38 Truncated variants of human cystatin C starting with Leu9 and Leu10, which correspond to Ile7 and Pro8 of stefin A, showed a four-fold increase (Ki ¼ 30 pM for L9-cystatin C) and a ten-fold decrease (Ki ¼ 1.8 nM for L10-cystatin C) in binding affinity to cathepsin H, compared to that of the wild-type cystatin C (Ki ¼ 127 pM).39 Elongated variants of stefin B with the ligated cystatin C

N-terminal part and with the ligated kininogen N-terminal part showed a ten-fold (Ki ¼ 0.14 nM) and a 50-fold (Ki ¼ 0.93 nM) decrease in binding affinity to cathepsin H, compared to that of the wild-type stefin B (Ki ¼ 0.02 nM).40 Our structure suggests that both truncated and elongated variants of cystatin and stefin bind into the pocket, which is equivalent to the S2 binding site in related proteases, and displace the mini-chain residue Thr83P. Interestingly, there seems to be an optimal N-terminal chain length for the interaction with cathepsin H. Truncation of the N terminus for a further residue would therefore be interesting. Such a truncated N terminus of stefin- or cystatintype inhibitor would not interfere with the minichain, but would, in a substrate-like manner, form favorable interactions with the C-terminal carboxyl group of Thr83P. Cathepsin C,41 similarly as cathepsin H, exhibits aminopeptidase activity; however, it cleaves a pair of N-terminal residues at a time instead of a single one as cathepsin H. A putative model of the complex of cathepsin C structure42 and stefin A (not shown) shows that stefin A residue Pro8 fits into the S2 binding site of cathepsin C, whereas the side-chain of Ile7 overlaps with the cathepsin C N-terminal residue Asp1 positioned within the S3 binding area. The N-terminal Met6 of the stefin A hook, is positioned in a cavity formed between the first carbohydrate ring attached to the cathepsin C residue Asn5. The minimal structural change hypothesis suggests that the reduced affinity for cathepsin C (Ki ¼ 0.5 nM for cystatin C and Ki ¼ 1.1 nM for stefin A)20 can be accounted for by the formation and accommodation of the stefin A N-terminal hook. In this process the Ile7 residue of stefin A would displace the cathepsin C N-terminal residue Asp1, whereas the remaining N-terminal residue Met6 could take a position beside the carbohydrate ring by slightly pushing it aside. Predictions for interaction of cystatins with longer N-terminal tails are much less precise. The longer N-terminal tail of cystatins would be expected to push away the carbohydrate rings or even displace the first two or three N-terminal residues of the exclusion domain.

Conclusions
The binding process of stefins and cystatins to the active site cleft of a papain-like cysteine exopeptidases induces changes in the conformation of the N terminus of the cystatin-type inhibitors as well as in the structural features defining the exopeptidyl properties of these enzymes. The crystal structure of the stefin A ­cathepsin H complex sheds light only on a limited set of structural changes that take place during binding of an inhibitor. The interactions imposed by the N-terminal trunk of a cystatin-type inhibitor obviously weaken the interaction with aminopeptidases such as cathepsins H and C; however, they are not

sufficiently disturbing to abolish binding (all inhibition constants of naturally occurring inhibitors are in the nanomolar range).8 The hook conformation observed in the bound stefin A structure shows how an extended chain of the N terminus of stefins and cystatins can escape direct interactions with cathepsin H. It is not clear whether the longer N-terminal tail of cystatins also adopts the hook conformation on binding. In addition, cathepsin H, in contrast to aminodipeptidase cathepsin C, also exhibits endopeptidase activity,43 and it seems quite unlikely that substrates would follow the path of the stefin A hook. Furthermore, the p41 fragment inhibits cathepsin H in the nanomolar range (Ki ¼ 5.3 nM).44 It is hard to imagine that the first contact loop of the p41 fragment, forming a broad turn between a short N-terminal helix and a subsequent b-strand, would fold differently. Accommodation of the first contact loop seems to require even larger structural changes. Inspection of the putative complex based on the cathepsin L ­p41 fragment structure indicated that additional mini-chain residues, including the disulfide bond Cys80P ­Cys205, stand in the way of the p41 fragment structure. Whether special structural features of proteins like the p41 fragment or specific sequences of the N-terminal trunk of cystatin-type inhibitors or of a substrate are necessary to bind along the whole length of the twodomain interface thus remains to be investigated.

acid sequence analysis. The purified protein was concentrated in a spin concentrator (Centricon Amicon) to 3.3 mg/ml. Preparation of stefin A Recombinant human stefin A was prepared as described.46 Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE, native electrophoresis at pH 8.0, IEF and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The purified protein was concentrated in a spin concentrator (Centricon Amicon) to 5.7 mg/ml. Enzyme ­inhibitor complex preparation Adding both components, using a 1.3-fold molar excess of inhibitor, led to formation of a stoichiometric complex between stefin A and cathepsin H. Complex formation was checked on a Superdex G75 HR 10/30 column of the FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) by the superposition of three individual chromatograms. Proteins were eluted with 0.1 M acetate buffer, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 5.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/ minute. The enzyme ­inhibitor complex was eluted at a Ve value of 11.1 ml, cathepsin H at a Ve of 12.4 ml and stefin A at a Ve of 13.4 ml. The identity of the complex was additionally confirmed by native electrophoresis at pH 8.0, IEF and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The enzyme ­ inhibitor complex was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2), 1 mM EDTA and concentrated in a spin concentrator (Centricon Amicon) to 11 mg/ml.

Isolation of wild type cathepsin H Cathepsin H was isolated from porcine spleen by a procedure modified from that described.45 After homogenization and acid activation, the concentrated, dialyzed sample was applied to a CM Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mM bis-Tris, 1 mM EDTA (pH 6.0), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/minute. The concentrated non-bound fractions were applied to a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mM bis-Tris, 1 mM EDTA (pH 6.0), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/minute.

Cathepsin H was eluted by a NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/minute, at a concentration corresponding to 75 mM NaCl. The concentrated sample was dialyzed and applied to a Superdex G75 HR 10/30 column on an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Cathepsin H was eluted with 0.1 M acetate buffer, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 5.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/minute, at a Ve value of 12.4 ml. The purity and identity of cathepsin H were checked by SDS-PAGE, native electrophoresis at pH 8.0, isoelectric focusing (IEF) and N-terminal amino

Crystallization was carried out at 22 8C by the vapor diffusion method using 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 0.18 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.2). Droplets were formed by mixing 2 ml of protein solution (protein concentration 7 mg/ml) with 1 ml of 40 mM CdCl2 and 1 ml of the reservoir solution. Crystals were obtained from the clear drop after three weeks. Crystals of two space groups were identified: ° monoclinic P21 diffracting to 2.8 A resolution and orthor° hombic P212121, diffracting to 2.4 A. Monoclinic form data were collected using Cu Ka radiation from a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray generator RU200 and recorded on a 345 mm MAR Research image plate detector. Similar data sets were taken at the synchrotron XRD beam line at Elettra (Trieste, Italy), but were not used due to high mosaicity of the frozen crystals. Orthorhombic form data were collected using synchrotron radiation with ° wavelength of 0.93 A on the ID14-beamline at ESRF/ Grenoble, France. Both crystals were soaked in a cryoprotecting buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol, 18% PEG 4000, 0.18 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer(pH 4.2)) and frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen gas at 90 K (Oxford Cryo Systems). Crystals were highly mosaic. Only a few gave diffraction patterns that could be processed. Diffraction data for the orthorhombic crystal form even had to be collected in three frames (w ¼ 1­ 748, 201­ 2708 and 301­ 3108). All data sets were processed using the HKL program suite.47 Structure determination Orientation and translation of the cathepsin H and stefin A molecules were determined using the molecular

replacement method implemented in the AMoRe program.48 The search model was generated from structures of cathepsin H without mini-chain23 and stefin B from the stefin B ­ papain complex.22 At first, molecules were used independently to identify the space group and a partial solution. In the second round, the partial solution was used as a search model to find the final four pairs of molecules in the monoclinic crystal form (correlation factor of 0.61 and R-value of 0.36). For molecular replacement in the orthorhombic crystal form, the already partially refined model of the cathepsin H­ stefin B from the monoclinic crystal form was used (correlation factor of 0.70 and R-value of 0.40). In both ° ° cases data from 15 A to 3.5 A resolution were used. For further steps of structure determination (four-fold electron density averaging, electron density map calculations, model building and analysis, crystallographic structure refinement) the computer program MAIN49 was used. During refinement, the resolution of diffraction data was gradually expanded to the final range ° ° ° (10 A ­2.8 A/2.4 A). Due to a large number of smeared reflections in the orthorhombic crystal form, which were, to a large extent, integrated with large errors, a 2s cutoff was introduced. The number of observed reflections dropped from 56,687 to 41,426. Use of the cutoff reduced completeness of the data, but improved the fourfold averaged and non-averaged electron density maps and made refinement of the structure possible. Averaged kicked omit maps were used throughout the structure determination process to identify ambiguous parts of the structure. Structure factors for the kicked omit maps were calculated from randomly displaced ° atoms up to 0.7 A along each coordinate. Water molecules were generated using an automatic procedure in MAIN49 and then corrected manually in several steps during refinement in the monoclinic crystal form only. After the crystallographic R-value dropped to 0.25, the

restrained individual temperature factor refinement was included. The final refinement included all reflections for the monoclinic and reflections with 2s cutoff for the orthorhombic space group, and yielded the final model ° at 2.4 A resolution, with the crystallographic R-value of 0.235. The geometry of the final models was inspected with MAIN49 and PROCHECK.50 All residues lie in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, the majority lying within the most favored regions. All computations were performed on Alpha workstations running under True Unix 5.1. The crystallographic data and their statistics are shown in Table 2. Modeling of cathepsin C­stefin A complex He model of the cathepsin C ­ stefin A complex was created with the program MAIN49 by superposition of a papain-like structure of cathepsin C42 on the equivalent parts of the cathepsin H structure in the stefin A­ cathepsin H complex.
