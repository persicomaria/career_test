Medical Research Council of Canada, Group in Protein Structure and Function Department of Biochemistry University of Alberta Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2H7 Canada Binding constants for complexes of variants of the ovomucoid inhibitor domain 3 from turkey (OMTKY3) and Streptomyces griseus protease B (SGPB) have been computed. On the basis of the crystallographically determined structures of the complexes, continuum electrostatic calculations have been carried out to evaluate the electrostatic contribution to the binding energy. The hydrophobic component was computed based on the change in the solvent accessible surface area on complex formation. These two terms were combined linearly and the parameters for the protein dielectric, atomic solvation parameter and a constant term were derived using a multivariate Æt to the observed binding energies. The resulting Æt shows a high correlation with a multiple coefÆcient of determination of 0.79. This indicates that 79% of the variation in the observed binding energies is explained by the electrostatic and hydrophobic terms. The analysis results in a protein dielectric of 8.2 and an   atomic solvation parameter of 30 cal/mol A2. As a test, these parameters were used to calculate the binding energies of complexes of chymotrypsin and of leukocyte elastase OMTKY3, as well as three other variants of OMTKY3 bound to SGPB. As these structures were not used for the multivariate Æt, they serve as an independent check on the derived parameters. The calculated energies for the three new variants of OMTKY3 are in good agreement with the observed values. However, the binding energies of the other complexes are poorly predicted. This implies that the parameters that were obtained are not transferable. The possible causes for this lack of transferability are discussed.

Various approaches to calculating absolute or relative binding free energies have been proposed. A direct computation of the free energy difference between related complexes can be obtained by the free energy perturbation method (reviewed by Straatsma & McCammon, 1991). However, this method is computationally expensive and long simulations are needed to assure sufÆcient sampling (Mark et al., 1994). A shorter computation is needed with the linear free energy approximation (Aqvist et al., 1994), but its general applicability has yet to be demonstrated. Semi-empirical approaches include those that correlate the change in accessible surface area to the binding afÆnities through the use of atomic solvation parameters (Hilser et al., 1996; Horton & Lewis, 1992).

1684 However, these methods lack contributions from speciÆc inter-atomic interactions, even though Horton & Lewis (1992) attempt to overcome this by deÆning the surfaces as being polar or apolar according to hydrogen-bonding. The energies that are derived from these two surfaces are then combined using additional parameters that deÆne the relative contributions from each component. Another approach has been to compute the total change in accessible surface area that is then used to compute the hydrophobic contribution and combined with electrostatic interaction energies (Gilson & Honig, 1988; Lee et al., 1992; Nicholls et al., 1991; Zhang & Koshland, 1996). It is this last method that will be examined in this paper. The strengths and weaknesses of this method have been discussed by Froloff et al. (1997). The system that will be analyzed is the complex between Streptomyces griseus protease B (SGPB) and the third domain of the turkey ovomucoid inhibitor (OMTKY3). SGPB is a chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase from the bacterium S. griseus. It consists of 185 amino acid residues and has a primary speciÆcity for hydrophobic residues (Bauer, 1978; Bigler et al., 1993; Jurasek et al., 1974; Lu e at., 1997). OMTKY3 is a small protein inhibitor consisting of 56 amino acid residues (Laskowski & Kato, 1980) with leucine at the P1 position (nomenclature according to Schechter & Berger (1967)). The crystal structure of the native complex has been   resolved at 1.8 A resolution (Fujinaga et al., 1982; Read et al., 1983). It showed a close approach of the Og atom of Ser195 (numbering according to an alignment to chymotrypsinogen; Fujinaga et al., 1982), to the carbonyl-carbon atom of Leu18I (residue numbers of OMTKY3 are followed by I) of   2.7 A. The structure also showed that most of the interactions between the two molecules were localized to residues from P6 to P3H . Similar results have been found in the case of the trypsin:pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex (Huber et al., 1974). The kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of this system have been studied extensively by Laskowski & co-workers (Laskowski & Kato, 1980). In particular, the P1 residue (residue 18I) of OMTKY3 has been changed to natural and unnatural amino acid residues and the binding constants of these variants to SGPB measured (Bigler et al., 1993; Lu et al., 1997). These variant complexes with SGPB show a wide range in binding constants from 3.6 ¬ 104 for Pro at P1 to 5.7 ¬ 1010 for Cys and for Leu at P1 at pH 8.3. Here, the variants will be denoted by the amino acid at the P1 position with the number 18 in superscript. For example the Pro variant will be Pro18. The pH dependence of the binding constants for the ionizable amino acid residues at the P1 position has also been studied (Abul Qasim et al., 1995; Lu et al., 1997). These residues show increased pKa values for acidic residues and a decreased pKa for lysine and histidine when bound to the hydrophobic pocket of SGPB. Many of these variants in complex with SGPB

have been crystallized and their structures determined (Huang, 1995; Huang et al., 1995; K.H., K.S.B. & M.N.E., unpublished data). The structures and the thermodynamic data provide us with a data set that can be used to assess the success of the computations of the binding afÆnity between these molecules. The electrostatic contribution to binding has been calculated as outlined by Gilson & Honig (1988). The total electrostatic energy is deÆned as the sum of a Coulombic and solvation terms: ¡G  ¡G  ¡G elec coul solv

where ¡G coul represents the energy of assembling the charges on the atoms in the molecule from an initial state in which all the charges are separated from each other by inÆnity in a medium of constant dielectric e, and ¡G represents the energy solv of changing the dielectric of the medium outside of the solute from e to es. This is not a ``true'' solvation term, as a transfer from vacuum to a solvated environment would initially have a region of dielectric equal to 1 outside of the solute while the solute would still have e > 1. The ¡G value is solv calculated using the Ænite difference Poisson ± Boltzman method (Gilson & Honig, 1988). The electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy is then the difference in the total electrostatic energies of the complex (E:I) and the individual components in the free form (E and I): ¡¡G  ¡G EXI ¿ ¡G E ¿ ¡G I 2 elec elec elec elec The hydrophobic contribution of the binding free energy is assumed to be proportional to the change in the solvent accessible surface area upon forming the complex and is estimated using: ¡¡G  Csolv ¡A hydr 3

where Csolv is the atomic solvation parameter and ¡A is the difference in the solvent accessible areas between the complexed and free forms, i.e.: ¡A  AEXI ¿ AE ¿ AI 4 where A(x) is the surface accessible area of molecular species x. The Csolv value is constant for all atoms. This treatment follows the analysis described by Nicholls et al. (1991) in which the hydrophobic association energy is calculated as the association of two uncharged molecules. This is done through the use of a Born cycle in which free molecules are Ærst uncharged before complexation and then charged again after the complex is formed. Various values for e and Csolv have been used by different investigators. Here, these constants will be determined by Ætting the calculated binding free energies to the experimentally observed values. The validity of the Æt will be checked by comparing the energies of complexes not used in the Æt.

Results
Effect of changing the protein dielectric We began the work by looking at the effect of using a different value of dielectric constant, e, for the solute because a wide range of values for the protein dielectric had been reported (Harvey, 1989). Figure 1 shows the change in the total electrostatic energies as the protein dielectric is changed. There is a linear relationship between the electrostatic energies calculated with different protein dielectric: ¡¡G e  2ae¡¡G e  2 elec elec 5
Figure 2. Linear dependence of the electrostatic energy on the inverse of the protein dielectric. The slopes from Figure 1 along with points for e  80 and e  2 are plotted. The points lie on a line y  2x.

where ¡¡G (e) represents the electrostatic conelec tribution to the binding free energy evaluated with the protein dielectric e. Thus, the electrostatic energy is proportional to the inverse of the protein dielectric constant (Figure 2). The calculation of the electrostatic solvation energy can be recast in terms of a reaction Æeld where the effect of the solvent is represented by a set of charges on the surface of the solute protein (DelPhi, 1993): ¡Gsolv

these forms (equations (6) and (7)], it is easy to see how the linear dependence on the inverse of the protein dielectric (equation (5)) comes about. Optimal values for the dielectric and hydrophobic contributions As the hydrophobic energy is taken to be proportional to the difference in the accessible area and the electrostatic energy is proportional to the inverse of the protein dielectric, it seemed reasonable to combine these terms in a linear fashion and to do a multiple linear regression against the experimentally measured binding energies. Multivariate linear regressions were done using the formula: ¡Gcalc  a¡A  b¡¡G e  4  c elec 8 where, ¡Gcalc is the calculated binding free energy, ¡A is the difference in accessible surface area and ¡¡G elec (e  4) is the difference in electrostatic energy evaluated for protein dielectric of 4. The values for a, b, c are adjustable parameters which were optimized to make ¡Gcalc agree with the experimentally measured ¡G . The ¡G obs obs values were obtained from: ¡G  ¿RT ln Keq obs 9 where, R is the gas constant (2.0 cal K¿1 mol¿1), T is the temperature in Kelvin (294 K) and Keq is the equilibrium association constant (M¿1). Then, the parameter a would correspond to Csolv and b to 4/e. The Æts to the data were used to choose among different models of the protonation states as shown below.

chains were found bound to a solvent molecule that has been interpreted to be a potassium ion. As the experimental measurements of the binding constants were not done in the presence of K, the calculations were repeated in the presence and in the absence of the K. It should be noted that the inclusion of K affects both the electrostatic and hydrophobic terms. Figure 3 shows the multivariate Æts done with the energies for the Asp¿18 and Glu¿18 variants calculated with and without K. The resulting parameters are shown in Table 1. The best Æt is obtained without the K. Protonation of carboxyl groups For the neutral forms, Asp 18 and Glu 18, it was not known to which oxygen atom of the carboxyl group the proton would be attached. This is of importance since it affects the partial charges assigned to the oxygen atoms, as well as changing the position of the partially positively charged hydrogen atom. Therefore, two neutral forms of these groups were generated for the calculation (Asp 18, Asp *18, Glu 18, Glu *18). The resulting energies show very little difference between the two forms (Figure 3), so it is not possible from this analysis to resolve this ambiguity.

Variation of binding energies as a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions With an optimal choice of protonation state and the absence of K in the cases of the acidic variants, the linear combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic energies can explain 79% of the variability in the observed binding energies (Figure 3b). The multivariate Æt results in a constant term of 13.5 kcal mol¿1, an atomic solvation parameter of   30 cal mol¿1 A¿2, and protein dielectric of 8.2. The standard error of the estimated change in free energy is 1.6 kcal mol¿1 with the maximum error of 2.9 kcal mol¿1 for the Pro18 variant (Figure 4). It is perhaps worth noting that the Pro18 variant is unique in having a signiÆcantly different conformation at the active site from all the other variants (K.H., K.S.B. & M.N.G.J., unpublished data). Figure 5 shows the energies ordered according to the hydrophobic energy. It shows how the ordering according to the hydrophobic energy is modiÆed by the contribution from the electrostatic term. In general, the more polar groups have more detrimental effect on the overall binding energy. This is to be expected from the hydrophobic nature of the S1 binding pocket in SGPB. However, the S1 pocket is not totally hydrophobic (Figure 6). There are oxygen atoms, Ala192 O, Gly16 O, Gly218 O, and

However, further down in the pocket, there are some polar atoms that would not be favorable for binding of larger hydrophobic residues. Water molecules have been identiÆed in this region of the complex (Huang et al., 1995). The drawing was made using the programs VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996) and Raster3D (Merritt & Bacon, 1997).

Test of the fitted parameters Since starting the work on the calculation of the binding constants, the structures of three other variants of OMTKY3 complexed with SGPB have become available. These are Ser18, Thr18 and His18. In addition, the structures of the chymotrypsin: OMTKY3 complex (PDB code 1cho; Fujinaga et al., 1987) and the leukocyte elastase:OMTKY3 complex (PDB code: 1ppf; Bode et al., 1986) have been determined. The surface areas and the electrostatic energies were calculated for these complexes as outlined above, and the total free energies of binding were computed using the parameters obtained above. These additional points are shown in Figure 8. It shows that the calculated energies for the SGPB complexes are in good agreement with the observed values, but the energies for the chymotrypsin and especially the elastase complex are not predicted correctly. It should be noted that for all the SGPB complexes, there is only a single amino acid change at the P1 position, whereas in the other complexes there are many changes in the chemical and three-dimensional structure of the enzyme compared to that of SGPB. In addition, conformational changes on binding to SGPB are expected to be similar for all the OMTKY3 variants. Binding of OMTKY3 to chymotrypsin results in a signiÆcantly different conformation of the inhibitor as compared with that found when OMTKY3 is bound to SGPB (Fujinaga et al., 1987). It should also be noted that SGPB and OMTKY3 are neutral molecules, but chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase have net charges of 3 and 11, respectively. The higher net charges on these mol-

ecules may make the derived dielectric constants inappropriate. The lack of agreement for the chymotrypsin and elastase complexes may result from any of these differences. Many factors which are not included in the calculation of the binding energy may be cancelling out in the case of the SGPB:OMTKY3 variant complexes due to their similarities. Coulombic energy In many docking algorithms, the electrostatic contribution to binding is computed using only the Coulombic term. The Coulombic energy is the energy between the electrostatic charges on the enzyme and those on the inhibitor (equation (7)). The solvation term included in our calculations represents the energy of transferring these charges from an environment of constant low dielectric (e.g. e  2± 4) to an environment with high exterior dielectric (e  80). The Coulombic and solvation terms have opposite signs and tend to cancel each other (Figure 7). The correlations among the different terms contributing to the binding energy are shown in Table 2. The Coulombic term shows low correlation with the binding energy, and it requires the combination of the total electrostatic energy with the hydrophobic energy to produce a high correlation. A multivariate analysis using only the Coulombic and the hydrophobic terms results in poor agreement (Figure 9) with R2 of 0.46 and standard error of 2.0 kcal mol¿1. It is only when the solvation term is included that a high correlation with the observed binding energy is obtained. However, as the calculation of the solvation term is computationally expensive, it is understandable that this term is often not included in docking algorithms that need to screen a large number of potential candidates in different conÆgurations.

Effect of changing the charge set The dependence of the results on the charge set was investigated by repeating the calculations using the CHARMM topallh22x (Brooks et al., 1983; MacKerell et al., 1992) charge set as distribu» ted with the XPLOR program (Brunger, 1993). The multivariate analysis results in a multiple coefÆcient of determination, R2, of 0.77. This is close to that obtained using the GROMOS charge set. The parameters obtained from the multivariate Æt using the CHARMM charge set are, 34 cal mol¿1   A¿2 for the atomic solvation parameter, 9.6 for the protein dielectric and a constant term of 25.5 kcal mol¿1. It is gratifying to see that these values are similar to those obtained with the GROMOS charge set. The analysis shows that the magnitude of the error expected due to the different charge sets is small. It should be noted that the difference in energy for a given variant cannot be attributed simply to the charges on that amino acid alone, as the electrostatic energy is dependent on the charges on all of the atoms. One of the differences between the GROMOS and CHARMM charge sets is that in the former, aliphatic groups are uncharged, whereas in the latter there are small partial charges associated with these groups.

Figure 9. Multivariate analysis using only the Coulombic and hydrophobic terms. Observed binding energy is plotted against the optimal energy calculated as ¡Gcalc  a ¡¡Gcoul  b ¡¡Ghydr. The R2 obtained (46) is considerably less than in the case where the total electrostatic energy is considered.

Even though the overall correlation is reasonable, the error in the calculated binding energy compared to the experimentally measured value for a particular variant may be up to 2.9 kcal mol¿1 with the average error being 0.9 kcal mol¿1. This is a much larger error than that reported by Zhang & Koshland (1996), who obtained an average error of 0.5 kcal mol¿1 for their series of complexes. On the other hand, their binding free energies had a range of about 3 kcal mol¿1, whereas in our case the observed binding energies vary over 8 kcal mol¿1. There are many sources of error in our calculations. There are errors in the atomic model, errors in the electrostatic calculations, errors in the hydrophobic energies, and errors due to terms that are not included in the calculations. The errors in the atomic model arise mainly from assuming a static structure. The calculations assumed that the enzyme and inhibitor structures in the uncomplexed state are identical to those found in the complex. This may not have a signiÆcant effect for the enzyme structure as its structure does not change much among the different complexes and in the native structure. As for the inhibitor, the crystal structure of the free ovomucoid inhibitor third domain from silver pheasant (OMSVP3) is known (Bode et al 1985). OMSVP3 is closely related to OMTKY3, differing only at the P1 position, which is Met in OMSVP3 instead of Leu in OMTKY3. The crystal structure of the free OMSVP3 shows that it adopts a very similar conformation to that of OMTKY3 in complex with SGPB. However, there is a marked increase in the B-factors in the reactive site loop region containing the P1 residue of OMSVP3. This region is, nevertheless, well deÆned in the free inhibitor. Similarly, the crystal structure of the free ovomucoid inhibitor third domain from Japanese quail (OMJPQ3; Papamokos et al., 1982; Weber et al., 1981), which differs in sequence from OMTKY3 at six positions, shows a similar conformation to OMTKY3 bound to SGPB. Again, the reactive site loop in the free OMJPQ3 shows above average B-factors. The solution structure of OMTKY3 has also been determined using NMR and it indicates that there are no large changes in the structure of the inhibitor (Krezel et al., 1994). All these studies indicate that the conformation of OMTKY3 is similar in the free and bound states, but in the free state there is an increase in the Øexibility of the reactive site loop. This will have an effect on the entropy of the system but, as discussed below, we have not been able to incorporate this contribution to improve the agreement between calculated and observed binding energies. In any event, the important quantity is the free energy of the total system and it is not even clear how an increase in Øexibility of the protein will affect the entropy of the solvent.

1690 We have ignored the existence of bound water molecules in the structure. This was done because the positions of bound water molecules are not known for the uncomplexed inhibitors. In addition, their placement would necessitate the correct positioning of the hydrogen atoms. Bound water molecules have been found to have an important effect in some electrostatic calculations (Yang et al., 1993). The use of a static model also implies that there is no sampling of conformations that contribute to the free energy of binding. There are two sources of error associated with the electrostatic calculations. The Ærst is the electrostatic model used, which includes the partial charges assigned to the atoms in the structure and the use of a continuum model that incorporates two dielectric regions, one corresponding to the protein and the other to the solvent region. As shown above, the choice of the charge set has a small but signiÆcant effect on the calculated energy. Both of the charge sets tried are designed for use in molecular dynamics simulations of proteins and, therefore, may not represent optimal sets for use with a continuum model. The use of two discrete and distinct regions of dielectric is a gross simpliÆcation. In addition, assigning a constant dielectric for the interior of the protein does not take into account effects due to speciÆc interactions that would be important when comparing closely related compounds. Different groups in a protein would have different electronic polarizability and different Øexibilities that would change the way a particular region will accommodate different charges in its environment. The second source of error arises from the numerical nature of the Ænite-difference method and the boundary conditions used. It is known that the method is sensitive to the size of the grid used and to the positioning of the molecule within the grid, as well as to the boundary conditions (Smith & Honig, 1994). We have used a three-step focusing method that has been shown to give accurate results (Gilson et al., 1987). The size of the Ænest grid was not as small as we would have liked, but we were limited by our computing resources. Though the error in the individual electrostatic calculations may be relatively large, the solvation energy calculated as the difference of two calculations differing only in the solvent dielectric is much more precise. For example, the electrostatic calculations were repeated for the Asp¿18 variant   with the coordinates displaced by 0.2 A. The solvation energy difference was 0.6 kcal mol¿1 (corresponding to 0.1% of the total solvation energy), whereas the individual calculations differed by about 127 kcal mol¿1 (0.8% of the total solvation energy). The hydrophobic contribution is calculated as the free energy of association of two uncharged molecules in solution. We have calculated this as being proportional to the difference in the solvent accessible surface areas. We have chosen to Æt the constant of proportionality to our data rather than

Analysis of Protease:Inhibitor Complexes

choosing among the wide range of values reported   in the literature (16 cal mol¿1 A¿2, Eisenberg &   McLachlan (1986), 20 cal mol¿1 A¿2, Eriksson et al.   1992; 28 cal mol¿1 A¿2, Sharp et al. (1991)). By doing a Æt to the data, the resulting value is not strictly due to the hydrophobic contribution but includes any other contributions that are also proportional to the accessible surface area. There are various terms contributing to the binding free energy that have not been explicitly included due to difÆculties in estimating their values. Differences in van der Waals interactions are difÆcult to calculate reliably, as these interactions undergo large changes at close distances. The positions of atoms in the crystal structure are dependent, in part, on the way the various terms in the reÆnement of the structure were weighted. In order to place all the structures on an equal footing, they must be relaxed in the presence of an explicit solvent model by running a lengthy molecular dynamics simulation. This is a time-consuming process and there is no guarantee that the results would be more reliable. Some of the contributions from the van der Waals term would be implicitly included in the hydrophobic term. In addition, the van der Waals interactions between solute molecules in the complex will be replaced with solute-solvent interactions and the net effect may be negligible. In any event, calculations of the intermolecular van der Waals interactions of the crystallographic structures show a large positive energy (109 kcal mol¿1) for the Pro18 variant, whereas all the other structures give rise to intermolecular energies that are negative (¿16 to ¿41 kcal mol¿1). The large positive van der Waals energy for Pro18 correlates with the large overestimation of the afÆnity for this variant. The effect of conformational. energy is difÆcult to estimate as all of the structures of the free inhibitors are not known. However, the effect is expected to be small, as the torsional energies of the P1 residue in the complexes are all less than 1 kcal mol¿1 as calculated using the GROMOS force Æeld (van Gunsteren & Berendsen, 1987). There are no entropy terms included in our calculations. As in the van der Waals case, the entropy change due to hydrophobic solvation would be implicitly represented in the hydrophobic term. Attempts to incorporate main-chain and side-chain conformational entropy (D'Aquino et al., 1996; Doig & Sternberg, 1995; Lee et at., 1994) have not resulted in better agreement of the calculated energies with the experimentally observed values. However, these calculations have to make assumptions about the change in conformational freedom between the free and the complexed forms. Estimation of the change in entropy due to loss of degrees of freedom in complex formation is also difÆcult (Brady & Sharp, 1997), but may be relatively constant among the different P1 variants used here. Another important entropic term is the entropy of charging the molecules in solution. The

1691 ment around the P1 residue. As the analyses were done using structures with identical amino acid sequences, except for the P1 position, the resulting parameters may not be transferable to other systems. Atomic solvation parameter

hydrophobic energy was calculated assuming that the molecules are uncharged and, subsequently, the enthalpic contributions due to charging the system were evaluated. Thus the entropic contribution of charging the molecules in solution has been neglected. Derived parameters Constant term There are various contributions that are expected to make up the constant term. Residues unaffected by the changes in the P1 residue will make constant contributions to conformational entropy, van der Waals energy and conformational energy. The entropy change to the decrease in degrees of freedom due to complex formation may also be relatively constant, assuming that the change in the intermolecular vibrational entropy is small. On the other hand, this may be an invalid assumption as the variants have a large range of binding afÆnities ($106). There would also be a term that would refer the calculated result to the same standard state as in the experimental values. Dielectric constants Dielectric constants are used to model the polarizability of the medium. The dielectric constants of proteins have been measured to be in the range of 2 ± 4 (Harvey, 1989). The use of a static model without the optimization of the uncomplexed structures or the hydrogen atom positions is expected to contribute to a larger value for the dielectric. The value of 8.2 that results from the multivariate Æt is slightly higher than the value of 4 used by many investigators, but substantially lower than the value of 20 used by others (Antosiewicz et al., 1994). As has been stressed by Warshel and coworkers (King et al., 1991; Sham et al., 1997), when the ``dielectric constant'' is adjusted to make the calculated result agree better with the experiment, it represents all the contributions that were not treated explicitly. In addition, such effective dielectric constants are expected to vary for each interaction, depending on the degree of relaxation that the protein can undergo (Sham et al., 1998). Here, any conformational differences due to binding of different variants would be incorporated as we have used the crystallographically determined structures of the complexes. It should also be noted that the dielectric constant that we obtain represents the average polarizability of the environTable 3. Summary of crystal structures used

The value of the atomic solvation parameter that   we have obtained is 30 cal mol¿1 A¿2 with an error ¿1   ¿2 of estimate of 6 cal mol A . This is within the range of values reported for this parameter. Recent   values range from 20 cal mol¿1 A¿2 (Eriksson et al., 1992) determined from an analysis of cavity form  ing mutants of T4 lysozyme, 28 cal mol¿1 A¿2 from liquid to water transfer energies of n-alkanes   (Sharp et al., 1991), to 42 cal mol¿1 A¿2 for cavity formation energy (Jackson & Sternberg, 1994). Some of the differences are obviously due to differences in the processes being described. As with the dielectric constant, the atomic solvation parameter that we derive from the multivariate Æt would include any contribution that is dependent on the solvent accessible surface.

Materials and Methods
Coordinates and hydrogen atom placement Crystal structures of complexes of 15 variants were available at the time of this work. These are summarized in Table 3, and include the structures of the Asp¿18 and Glu¿18 variants done at pH 10.7. The high pH structures included a K bound to the acidic groups in the S1 pocket. The calculations of the low pH form of the Asp18 and Glu18 variants (Asp 18 and Glu 18) were repeated with the proton on different carboxyl oxygen atoms (Asp *18 and Glu *18). Thus, calculations were done on a total of 17 structures. Water molecules identiÆed in the crystallographically determined structures of the complexes were not used, as the bound water positions in the free inhibitors are not known. Hydrogen atom positions were generated using Insight II (InsightII, 1993) by Biosym. No optimization was done to place the hydrogen atoms having free rotations allowed in their conformations. Electrostatic calculations The electrostatic calculations were done using the linear form of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation: " r ¡ er ¡ r ¡ fr ¿ k2 fr  4print r  0 10 where e(r) is the dielectric function, f(r) is the electrostatic potential function, r is the position vector, rint(r) is the interior charge distribution and r is the vector differ-

where, e is the electronic charge, NA is Avogadro's number, I is the ionic strength, kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature. The equation was solved numerically by the Ænite difference method (Gilson & Honig, 1988), as implemented in the DelPhi module (DelPhi, 1993) of the Biosym Insight II (Insight II, 1993) software. The dielectric constant for the solvent was Æxed at 80, whereas different dielectric constants, varying from 2 to 4, were tried for the solute (protein). An ionic strength of 0.11, corresponding to the experimental condition for the measurement of the binding constants (Bigler et al., 1993), was used. Two different charge sets, GROMOS r37c (van Gunsteren & Berendsen, 1987), and CHARMM topalh22x (Brooks et al., 1983; MacKerell et al., 1992) were used. The calculations were done with three focusing steps (Klapper et al., 1986). The Ærst step used     a 15 A border around the protein with a 1 A grid spacing and Coulombic boundary. A Coulombic boundary condition calculates the potential at each boundary point using Coulomb's Law with each charge in the   system. The second step used a 10 A border, with a   0.75 A grid spacing and the boundary points obtained from the grid in step 1 (focus boundary). The third step     used a 5 A border, and a 0.5 A grid spacing and the focus boundary from step 2.

Hydrophobic contribution The hydrophobic contribution of the binding free energy was obtained using ¡¡G  Csolv¡A, where hydr ¡A is the change in solvent accessible area and Csolv is the atomic solvation parameter. The accessible area was calculated using the programs of the CCP4 program suite (CCP4, 1994) that uses the algorithm described by   Lee & Richards (1971) and a probe radius of 1.4 A.

Experimental data Most of the experimental binding constants were taken from Bigler et al. (1993) and Lu et al. (1997) and were measured at pH 8.30 and an ionic strength 0.11. The pH dependencies of the binding constants for the Asp18, Glu18 and the Lys18 variants have been measured (Abul Qasim et al., 1995; Lu et al., 1997) and the binding constants for the neutral and charged forms of these residues were determined.
