Abstract Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with the translation mechanism by binding to the tRNA decoding site of the 16S ribosomal RNA. Crystallographic structures of aminoglycosides bound to A-site systems clarified many static aspects of RNA­ligand interactions. To gain some insight on the dynamic aspects of recognition phenomena, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of the aminoglycoside paromomycin bound to a eubacterial ribosomal decoding A-site oligonucleotide. Results from 25 ns of simulation time revealed that: (i) the neamine part of the antibiotic represents the main anchor for binding, (ii) additional sugar rings provide limited and fragile contacts, (iii) long-resident water molecules present at the drug/RNA interface are involved in the recognition phenomena. The combination of MD simulations together with systematic structural information offers striking insights into the molecular recognition processes underlying RNA/aminoglycoside binding. Important methodological considerations related to the use of medium resolution starting structures and associated sampling problems are thoroughly discussed. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction Aminoglycoside antibiotics [1,2] are known to exert their antimicrobial activities by targeting the decoding A-site of the rRNA and inducing aberrant protein synthesis [3,4]. Successful development of novel antibiotic compounds that can effectively target the A-site and address important drug resistance issues [5] requires a detailed understanding of the interactions involved in the specificity and efficiency of binding of existing ligands [6,7]. Recent structural and biochemical [7­10] studies have provided key insight on the mechanisms of binding of these antibiotics to the A-site. In particular the binding of aminoglycoside compounds to the 16S rRNA A-site of Escherichia coli induces the bulging out of two universally conserved adenines (A1492 and A1493) which resembles the bulging of the

same residues induced by cognate tRNA binding seen in crystallographic studies of the Thermus thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit [9]. A series of recent crystallographic studies of various aminoglycosides including paromomycin in complex with 16S rRNA A-site model oligonucleotides have revealed the details of the binding site geometries and the associated drug­RNA contacts [11­21]. These studies revealed the presence of an organized network of water-mediated contacts within and around the binding site that complements the network of direct RNA/aminoglycosides hydrogen bonds. However, the picture is blurred by resolution limits that are not better than 2.2 Å. In particular, in the paromomycin/A-site structure at 2.5 Å resolution [13], a number of water molecules form an intricate network of hydrogen bonds within the drug binding pocket. Specific water-mediated interactions are a universal feature of biomolecular recognition landscapes in folding [22], structural stabilization [23,24] and binding processes [25,26]. Information related to the position of water molecules is sometimes included in ligand docking strategies [27,28].

Although the precise role of water remains in many regards unclear, it has been suggested that the possibility of distinguishing tightly bound water molecules from fast-exchanging molecules is useful for rational drug design. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow detailed analysis of such interactions through the characterization of individual hydration sites [23,29­33]. The binding of aminoglycosides to RNA has previously been investigated through MD simulations [21,34] and continuum electrostatic methods [35]. Moreover, details from a simulation of the full ribosomal particle including the A-site have been published [36,37]. Here we report a MD study of a rRNA fragment containing two symmetrically arranged "minimal" A-sites, each of which interacts with a paromomycin molecule, in explicit water and salt environment. In the following, these sites will be called A1 and A2 (Fig. 1a, b). The simulated system was designed to match as closely as possible the one reported in a previous crystallographic study [13], allowing results of the calculations to be readily compared with experiment at all stages. In addition, simulating two symmetrical sites offers the computational advantage of sampling twice the solute conformational space without the substantial solvent overhead involved in running two independent simulations of a single A-site. It should be noted that the crystallographic structure is not completely symmetrical. Intrinsic asymmetries due to crystal packing forces can be noted. Furthermore, one of the two sites (A1) is better "resolved" than the other (A2), as reflected by the fact that: (i) nine versus only three hydration sites are found close to the paromomycin molecule in sites A1 and A2, respectively; and (ii) the experimental temperature factors associated with site A1 are smaller than those associated with site A2.

2. Computational methods 2.1. Simulated system The starting structure used for the simulation of the aminoglycoside­RNA complex was derived from the 2.5 Å resolution X-ray structure (PDB code: 1J7T) described in Ref. [13]. The simulated system consists of: (i) two symmetrically arranged rRNA A-sites, referred to as A1 and A2, linked by four G = C base pairs (Fig. 1a); (ii) two paromomycin molecules (Fig. 1b); (iii) 65 K+ cations; (iv) 35 Cl­ anions; and (v)  10,000 SPC/E water molecules [38], resulting in a  0.2 M excess KCl salt concentration. Water molecules and ions were initially placed in the simulation box at a distance larger than 3 Å from any solute atom by using the standard AMBER LEAP routines: SOLVATEBOX and ADDIONS [39]. Crystal waters were not included in the simulated system. 2.2. Force-field parameters The standard AMBER 1999 force-field was used for all calculations. Force-field parameters for paromomycin were obtained by using the ANTECHAMBER module in AMBER [39]. The set of partial atomic charges for the fully protonated (+5) paromomycin molecule was derived using a least-square fit of the electrostatic potential obtained from high level quantum chemical calculations and based on the fully optimized RHF/6-31G* ground state geometry. These calculations were performed with the NWChem 4.5 package [40] using the standard 6-31G* basis set and the restricted Hartree­Fock (RHF) level of theory. The van der Waals parameters for the K+ and Cl­ ions, calibrated for the SPC/E water model used throughout this work [38], were extracted from the studies [41] and [42],

were constrained using SHAKE [47], allowing an integration time step of 2 fs to be used. 2.4. Hydration density The three-dimensional probability landscape for finding a water molecule at a given spatial position (hydration density) was calculated using the procedure described in [30­32]. Each simulation frame was initially realigned to a standard reference frame given by the initial positions of the heavy atoms of the neamine moiety (i.e. rings I and II) of the antibiotic and by taking periodic boundary conditions into account. These rings were chosen since they correspond to the most rigid part of the ligand (see below). By using the SFALL program of the CCP4 library (http://www.dl.ac.uk/CCP/CCP4), the positions of 400 water oxygen atoms closest to any heavy atom of the antibiotic were then selected from each frame and binned into a cubic grid using a 0.33 Å grid step. The resulting density is normalized to the number of frames and water molecules per frame in order to obtain the final oxygen atom density values that, subsequently, can be converted in "pseudo-electron" densities. The positions of high-density peaks were obtained from the calculated density maps using the PEAKMAX program of the CCP4 library. 2.5. Water residence times The residence time of a water molecule in a given site was defined as the maximum contiguous stretch of simulation time for which the molecule is found to occupy the given site. A water molecule was considered to occupy a particular solvation site at a given time step n if the molecule was found to be within a spherical volume of radius R centered on the site itself. Values chosen for R were as follows: R = 1.5 Å for "entry" of the molecule in the site i.e. if the molecule was not in the site at step n ­ 1, and R = 2.0 Å for "exiting" the site i.e. if the molecule was already occupying the site at step n ­ 1. The time interval between frames chosen for these calculations was of 2.5 ps. 3. Results 3.1. Antibiotic­RNA contacts All the intermolecular contact distances between the antibiotic and the RNA binding pocket deduced from the crystal structure (see Fig. 1b) were monitored in each of the two symmetric A-sites during the course of a first 10 ns simulation (simulation S1). The time versus distance plots for each contact and corresponding distribution histograms are represented in Fig. 3a. Average distance and standard deviations, along with corresponding experimental value, are provided for each contact established in the A1 and A2 sites (Table 1). The calculated distance distributions exhibit well-defined peaks and are mainly unimodal, more rarely bimodal. The most stable contacts are those relative to the neamine moiety (i.e. rings I and II) of the antibiotic. One important exception is associated with

respectively. Simulations undertaken with the standard AMBER van der Waals parameters for the K+ cations led systematically to a rapid and artifactual formation of salt aggregates in proximity of the solute (Auffinger and Vaiana, unpublished results; Fig. 2). The same type of behavior has also been described in other publications using the AMBER parameters for the ions [43]. 2.3. Simulation protocol All molecular mechanics (MM) minimizations and dynamics (MD) calculations were performed using the AMBER 7.0 package [39]. Long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method [44]. Prior to data collection, the system was equilibrated for 1.5 ns using the well-tested equilibration protocol described in Refs. [45,46]. The protocol involves a first energy minimization of the system followed by several harmonically constrained MD runs in the NPT ensemble at 1.0 atm and 300 K. The harmonic constraints are initially applied to all solute and ion atoms and are gradually reduced to zero during the first 500 ps of equilibration. During the last 1 ns of equilibration the system is allowed to relax without constraints, this phase differs from the proper production phase only in the fact that no data are collected for subsequent analysis. Two MD simulations (S1 for 10 ns and S2 for 15 ns) of the system were performed using slightly different initial conditions (see Section 2.2) and simulation lengths. All simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble at 1.0 atm and 300 K in an orthorhombic box (61.1 × 77.9 × 60.7 Å3) using periodic boundary conditions. Bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms

the contact established between the ammonium group N3 of ring II and the O2P atom of G1494 which is disrupted after 8 and 5 ns in site A1 and A2, respectively (Fig. 4). This event is associated with a local conformational change of the RNA backbone at the level of G1494 (C3­O3 angle) and of the bulging A1493 (O5­C5 angle). The contacts established by rings III and IV are not as stable as those related to the neamine moiety, revealing a higher mobility of these rings with respect to the binding pocket. In particular, the 3.8 Å contact, itemized in Ref. [13], established between the O4 hydroxyl group of ring IV and the O1P atom of G1405 never forms a hydrogen bond (Table 1 and Fig. 3a) whereas the 3.0 Å contact between the ammonium group N2 of ring IV and the O2P atom of G1405 forms transient hydrogen bonds in both sites. The two contacts associated with the O5 hydroxyl group of ring III (one intra- and one intermolecular contact) are also particularly fragile given the high mobility of the ­CH2­ linkage.

Overall, the contact values calculated for both sites show good agreement (within statistical error) between themselves and with the experimental values. Furthermore, most of the dynamical events observed in site A1 were also observed in site A2 suggesting that a reasonably uniform sampling of configurational space between the two symmetric halves of the system has been achieved. 3.2. Importance of starting conditions One notable exception to the symmetry between the A1 and A2 sites involves the contact between the O6 atom of ring II and U1406. In site A1, this contact is mediated by water molecules occupying an experimentally well characterized hydration site (W8 in Ref. [13]) and the singly hydrogen bonded conformation of the important U1406U1495 pair is maintained (Fig. 5, top panels). Detailed inspection of simulation S1 revealed that, for A1, the occupation of W8 occurred in the

initial stages of the equilibration procedure and can be considered, therefore, as unbiased. However, in A2, the equivalent hydration site (W54 in Ref. [13]) is not seen during the whole length of simulation S1. Instead, a direct hydrogen bond forms between the O6 atom of ring II and the O4 atom of U1406. Moreover, the conformation of the U1406U1495 pair is significantly altered (Fig. 5, middle panels). As a replacement for the bifurcated conformation observed in the crystal (associated with a single hydrogen bond linking the two bases and a water-mediated contact), the uridines shift, in the binding site A2, in order to adopt a two hydrogen bonded conformation that prevents the formation of a hydration site between the bases. In order to get some hints related to the origin of these significant structural discrepancies between the two sites, a more thorough examination of the crystal structure was undertaken. Interestingly, a small ~0.2 Å difference in the experimentally derived distance between the O6 atom of the antibiotic and the O4 atom of U1406 in the two sites (site A1: 5.0 Å; site A2: 4.8 Å; see Fig. 5, top panels) was noted. Hence, a new simulation (S2) was started in which this distance was set to 5.0 Å (site A2) by applying a harmonic constraint to this distance in the course of a 100 step steepest descent minimization. In all successive phases of the new simulation no constraint was applied to this distance and the same equilibration procedure as for simulation S1 was followed. Indeed, in simulation S2 the average view gathered for both sites display a better similarity: (i) in both sites the UU pair is in the experimentally observed configuration (Fig. 5, bottom panels) and (ii) the creation of a well-defined hydration site at deep groove position W8 (or W54) and the shallow groove position W49 becomes apparent in both binding pockets at the very first stages of the simulation (Fig. 6). In addition, as for simulation S1, the intermolecular antibiotic­RNA contacts monitored as a function of time for simulation S2 (Fig. 3b) show good agreement with the experimental values and confirm the higher mobility, in relation to the binding site, of rings III and IV as compared to rings I and II. Besides, the introduction of this small 0.2 Å correction at the level of a contact established between ring II and the RNA has also a significant impact over a distant contact established between the O3 atom of ring I and the O2P atom of A1492 (Figs. 3a and 4). In simulation S1, the average distances associated with this contact are of 2.7 and 3.2 Å, respectively, and can be related to different dihedral angle values at the level of the RNA backbone. In simulation S2, the different backbone conformation observed in site A2 reverts after 5 ns to the one observed in site A1 and remains associated with a relatively stable hydrogen bond distance of 2.7 Å. As a result of the better convergence established between both sites in simulation S2, simulation S1 will no longer be discussed in the following. Interestingly, in all simulations, the N3...O2P­G1494 contact breaks systematically during the second half of the trajectories (i.e. roughly after 5 ns) in an apparently non-reversible manner (Fig. 4). The recurrence of this structural transition at an important hinge of the RNA prompted us to calculate the hydration patterns for the first 5 ns of simulation S2, during

Fig. 6. Hydration of the U1495U1406 pair. The hydration densities calculated over the first 5 ns of simulation S2 around the UU pair for binding site A1 (top panel) and A2 (bottom panel) are shown. Yellow dashed lines mark possible hydrogen bonds. Hydration density peaks (yellow spheres) at the positions of the experimentally seen water molecules W8, W49 and W54 are well-defined. The hydration density profiles (taken here at the same iso-density value) for the two sites are remarkably similar.

which the conformation of the binding pocket remains the closest to that observed in the crystal structure. 3.3. Hydration densities derived from 3D probability landscapes In order to characterize the hydration sites located in the antibiotic binding pocket and detect all possible watermediated contacts, the three-dimensional probability landscape for finding a water molecule at a given position (hydration density) within the binding sites A1 and A2 was calculated from simulation snapshots taken at regular time intervals (2.5 ps) from the first 5 ns of simulation S2 as described in Section 2 and Section 2.2. Several density peaks corresponding to positions most frequently occupied by water molecules can clearly be identified (note that the crystal structure contains little information related to water molecules occupying the less wellresolved site A2). The positions of the highest 35 peaks obtained from the calculated density maps for the two distinct binding sites do not differ significantly revealing again the good level of convergence obtained between the two sites in simulation S2. Of these 35 calculated hydration sites, 21 are located at less than 4.3 Å from the neamine moiety (Fig. 7a). Among those eight and 13 hydration sites take part in: (i) direct and (ii) indirect water-mediated contacts between the neamine moiety of the antibiotic and the RNA residues in the binding pocket, respec-

tively (indirect contacts imply the participation of more than one water molecule). Interestingly, all of the nine experimentally observed hydration sites located at less than 4.3 Å of the neamine moiety were reproduced by the MD simulations (Fig. 7b). The average distance between the calculated and experimental sites is 0.7 Å, whereas the associated individual distances range from 0.3 to 1.3 Å. These data suggest that the calculated hydration sites correspond roughly to the crystallographic ones to within experimental uncertainty. The remaining 12 calculated hydra-

tion sites (in gray, Fig. 7a) could not be detected in the experimental structure although three of them occupy positions suggesting that they are involved in direct water-mediated contacts (with atoms O4 and N2 of ring I, see Fig. 7a). This implies that over half of the hydration sites in the antibiotic pocket were not detected experimentally. As noted above (see Section 2.2), the experimentally characterized hydration sites that are localized in the deep as well as in the shallow groove of the U1406U1495 pair were adequately reproduced by the simulations (Fig. 6). The hydration

patterns observed in both sites around the UU pair are strikingly similar. Note also the presence of hydration site w6 located above ring II and not involved in regular Ow...O/N hydrogen bonds (Fig. 7a). 3.4. Water molecule residence times Time scales accessible to MD simulations cover the femtosecond to nanosecond range, thus allowing dynamical properties of individual water molecules occupying high-density sites to be analyzed in great detail. Analysis of water molecule residence times can be used to distinguish if, and to what degree, a given density at a specific site is obtained by a few "trapped" water molecules occupying the site for long periods of time or by a fast dynamic exchange of many "short-resident" water molecules. The dynamical properties of water molecules occupying high-density hydration sites were investigated by calculating the corresponding maximum residence times (as described in Section 2). In addition, the total number of water molecules occupying each site in the course of the simulation was calculated. Results for the 10 highest density peaks occurring in both sites A1 and A2 are presented in Table 2. Three of the sites (labeled w1, w2, w4 in Fig. 6) are characterized by residence times greater than 1 ns that correlate with a small number of water molecule exchanges. These residence times can increase to 4.3 ns for w2 in site A2 (Table 2). Water molecules occupying these positions can be considered as strongly bound water molecules with dynamical properties more typical of a co-solute than of bulk solvent. These sites, with the possible exception of w4, form at least two stable contacts (i.e. they are at hydrogen bonding distance) to the ligand and the RNA. w4 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the paromomycin O2 atom and site w2 that is characterized by a high residence time (1.6 ns) and a low exchange rate. On the contrary, the group formed by sites w6, w9, and w11 is characterized by low residence times (less than 0.25 ns) in both binding pockets as well as high exchange rates. Nevertheless, the water molecules occupying these sites have to be distinguished from bulk

water since, by definition, no hydration site is associated with bulk water. Again, there is a good match between the values calculated for the A1 and A2 sites and the sites displaying residence times above 1 ns are the same in both binding pockets. Note also that, for the UU pair, the hydration sites localized in the shallow groove (W49; maximum residence time of 1.6 ns) and deep groove (W8; maximum residence time of 0.8 ns) are occupied by long residency water molecules. Hence, the specific hydrogen bonding pattern of this nonWatson­Crick pair is associated with a particularly stable hydration. 4. Discussion 4.1. The neamine moiety serves as an anchor of the antibiotic to the RNA The eight direct paromomycin/RNA contacts observed in the crystal structure [13] are quite well reproduced by the simulations described in this study. The importance of these direct contacts, suggested by crystallographic studies [11­18], is reflected in their stability as revealed by the distance versus time plots derived from the simulations (see Fig. 3a, b and Table 1). For example, the direct contact between the N1 ammonium group of ring II and the O4 atom of U1495 is observed in the paromomycin [13] but also tobramycin [14], geneticin [15], gentamicin C1A, neomycin B, lividomycin A, kanamycin A, ribostamycin, neamine [11], and two paromomycin derivative [12] complexes. This contact is stable throughout all simulations. The "pseudo-base pair" formed between ring I and the universally conserved base A1408 found in all these structures is also neatly reproduced by the simulations. It involves a contact between the O5 cyclic oxygen atom of ring I and the N6 atom of A1408 (all compounds) as well as a contact between the O6 (paromomycin, geneticin, lividomycin A) or N6 atoms (other antibiotics) of ring I and the N1 atom of the same RNA base. In addition, when an O3 and/or an O4 atom is present on ring I, direct O3...O2P­A1492 and/or O4...O2P­A1493 contacts are systematically reported.

These contacts were observed to be stable throughout the MD simulations. Other contacts between the neamine part of the antibiotic and the RNA are associated with the ammonium group N3 of ring II that establishes three hydrogen bond contacts, one each with the O1P­A1493, N7­G1494, and O2P­G1494 atoms. This ammonium group is of paramount importance for the association process since it forms three distinct and highly conserved hydrogen bond contacts with the RNA. Among the three neamine/N3 contacts, only the N3...O2P­G1494 contact breaks during the simulations (i.e. after 5 ns, see Fig. 4). Interestingly, the direct N3...O2P­G1494 contact is observed in all crystal structures with the exception of: (i) the lividomycin A complex, where this contact is water-mediated; (ii) the geneticin complex, where the water-mediated contact is found in equilibrium with the more usual N3...O2P­G1494 direct contact [11]. The recurrent instability of this N3...O2P­G1494 contact in the simulations cannot be explained unequivocally. It could result, among other factors, from some imbalance of force-field parameters. Yet, it also reflects a situation observed at least in two related experimental structures and, hence, suggests a greater fragility of this antibiotic/RNA contact. 4.2. Rings III and IV provide additional but more labile contacts While the neamine part is involved in eight highly conserved direct contacts, rings III and IV are only involved in a total of three to four contacts. Note that, among them, the O4...O1P­G1405 contact described in [13] is most probably not a hydrogen bond given the large 3.8 Å experimental distance associated with it. Indeed, in the simulations, no hydrogen bond is formed between these atoms. Furthermore, this contact is not described in the structure of the neomycin B complex [11]. On the other hand, the N2...O2P­G1405 and the O5...N7­G1491 contacts involving ring III and IV, respectively, are seen in both the neomycin B and lividomycin A complexes. In the simulations, however, they are associated with rather weak hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, the most stable antibiotic/RNA contact established between rings III and IV and the RNA is the one closest to the neamine part, namely O2...N4­C1407. Hence, it appears that not only the number of contacts established between the antibiotic and the RNA diminishes when moving from the neamine part toward ring III and IV, but their stability diminishes as well, confirming the neamine fragment in its anchor role. 4.3. Water at the antibiotic/RNA interface Despite the considerable amount of structural data accumulated on aminoglycoside/A-site interactions, detailed information on hydration patterns and solvent mediated interactions is hampered by resolution limits of crystallographic studies. The MD simulations presented here supplement the missing information with a detailed picture of hydration within the pocket and provide dynamic information on individual water molecules. Calculation of the hydration densities allowed derivation

of 21 hydration sites within the binding pocket. Of these hydration sites, nine correspond to the experimentally observed water molecules. The calculation of the maximum residence times for the highest 10 density peaks allowed to discriminate fast exchanging from structurally bound solute-like water molecules. To the latter group belong water molecules mediating important intermolecular contacts between RNA and paromomycin. Water molecules occupying hydration site w2 (corresponding to W8 [13]) display remarkably long residence times. The presence of a water molecule at this position is a unique characteristic of the 4,5-aminoglycoside family to which paromomycin belongs and is observed in the neomycin B, lividomycin A and ribostamycin complexes [11]. In the 4,6aminoglycoside family, due to the fact that the O6 atom of ring II is involved in a link with another ring, such a hydration site cannot be formed. In the aminoglycoside/A-site complexes with two paromomycin derivatives [12] and in the neamine crystal structure [11], this linking water molecule is absent because of a different conformation adopted by the UU pair. This study revealed the existence of water molecules in the binding pocket that are not observed in the crystal structures. These include the highly mobile solute-like waters (characterized by shorter residence times), as well as structurally bound molecules, such as w4. Interestingly, the experimental hydration sites are not necessarily associated with the peaks having the highest densities. This observation can be related to differences between the crystallographic and the more liquid like environment investigated here, although sampling issues can certainly not be excluded. 4.4. Conformation and hydration of the U1406U1495 pair In the structures of the bacterial, but also human cytoplasmic and human mitochondrial A-sites [48,49], the U1406U1495 pair is always present suggesting that it plays an important role in this rRNA motif. However, this structural role is not yet well understood, although it is most certainly strongly linked to the specific conformation that is recurrently observed in almost all known crystal structures (Fig. 5). The precise hydration pattern of this UU pair is well reproduced in both binding sites of simulation S2 as well as in the A1 binding site of simulation S1. The water molecules occupying both the deep and shallow groove hydration sites contribute most certainly to the stabilization of this particular base pair conformation (Fig. 6). The shape of the hydration pockets formed at the level of the UU pair and the pattern of associated hydrophilic groups results in two very effective water molecule traps since the bound water molecules occupying these sites have quite long residence times. Besides this recurrent conformation, the UU pair can also adopt a second conformation of a cisWatson­Crick/Watson­Crick type involving two hydrogen bond contacts as reflected in simulation S1 (see site A2; Fig. 5). Interestingly, this conformation is also observed in the empty site of the neamine complex [11]. Thus, depending on the structural context, this UU pair adopts a single or double hydrogen bonded conformation. Yet, it is difficult on the

A.C. Vaiana et al. / Biochimie 88 (2006) 1061­1073

1071

basis of the simulations alone to establish if a conformational equilibrium involving these two states really exists when the drug is bound to the RNA. It seems more likely that the observation of the double hydrogen bonded conformation, although realistic, results from some inaccuracies in the starting crystal structure related to the fact that site A2 is less well-resolved than its A1 counterpart [50]. 4.5. Methodological considerations As stated in the preceding sections, the simulations described in this study were able: (i) to reproduce many structural aspects of this paromomycin/RNA complex and (ii) to provide additional data related to the dynamics of the drug/ RNA contacts and its hydration. For example, the fact that all of the experimentally observed water molecules within the binding pockets could be accurately reproduced, points towards the reliability of the simulations. Yet, many more hydration sites could be characterized around the antibiotic than those detected in the medium resolution crystal structure. Thus, MD simulations offer the interesting possibility of providing support for new (experimentally unresolved) hydration sites that could serve as a basis for re-assigning water electron densities and, consequently, allowing post-refinement of existing medium resolution x-ray structures. On the other hand, in this type of study, one must carefully interpret results which can be affected, among other factors, by systematic errors in the simulation such as force-field induced biases or differences in the simulated solution environment as compared to that of a partially hydrated crystal [46,50]. The case of the hydration site W8 is typical of how much special care must be taken to avoid such problems. The fact that in the course of simulation S1, a calculated site equivalent to W8 (or W54, see Fig. 5) is not observed in site A2 during the simulation, can be due to several reasons ranging from high free energy barriers that would simply require much longer simulations to be overcome all the way to the above mentioned biasing factors. Indeed a difference in the initial structure of only 0.2 Å in the two sites was sufficient to produce a trajectory that did not fully reproduce the experimental data. For these reasons careful inspection of the simulated trajectories and constant comparison between experimental data and simulation results are essential to generate stable and reliable simulations [46,50,51]. Two other observations led to similar considerations: (i) the two hydrogen bonded conformation adopted by the U1406U1495 only for the site A2 in simulation S1; and (ii) the loss of the N3...O2P­G1494 contact established between ring II and the RNA in both sites of simulation S1 and S2. If the former structural transition can be directly linked to a tiny but significant change in the conformation of the A2 site, the latter occurs systematically after at least 5 ns of simulation. Thus, in a reasonable and conservative manner, we chose to analyze the hydration patterns over a time scale (first 5 ns) during which most of the structural features of the original complex were preserved. The chosen time scale (5 ns) is in any case sufficient to account for typical water relaxation

times. Indeed, it is a common rule that force-field or other methodological flaws reveal themselves only on the longer timescales [46,50]. In order to detect possible biases, it is useful to run independent simulations of a same system. Earlier attempts have shown the utility of running multiple molecular dynamics (MMD) simulations in order to evaluate the quality of the gathered data and, on a more statistical basis, the importance of force-field induced artefacts [52­54]. Here, an RNA fragment with two symmetrical antibiotic pockets was simulated. This strategy was quite effective in evaluating the recurrence of the observed effects and characterizing the influence of some small but significant structural perturbations that are, probably more often than wanted, to be found in medium to low resolution crystal structures. 4.6. Implications for drug design Molecular docking is an important drug design approach. On the basis of the observation that water molecules are often located at the drug/protein or drug/nucleic acid interface [55­ 60], various methods based on structural data were proposed for taking interfacial water molecules into account [61­63]. One of these methods addresses specifically this issue for RNA systems [28]. In the present study, at least three hydration sites occupied by water molecules having residency times exceeding the nanosecond were detected (Table 2). Additionally, numerous hydration sites occupied by easily displaceable water molecules were uncovered. Hence, present simulations complement structural data and provide valuable and coherent information related to where the most strongly bound and most easily displaceable water molecules are located. The use of such information will undoubtedly improve current docking strategies as well as stimulate the development of new drugs that target this important bacterial ribosomal site. 5. Conclusions Aminoglycoside antibiotics represent an important class of therapeutic agents that, despite bacterial resistance and serious side effects, are regularly used in hospitals. The natural target of aminoglycosides, the ribosomal decoding A-site, has become a model system for studying molecular recognition between RNA and small molecules. Much has been learned from recent medium resolution crystal structures of natural and synthetic aminoglycosides bound to the rRNA A-site. In an attempt to go beyond the static views provided by X-ray structures, MD simulations based on the crystal structure of a rRNA A-site fragment complexed with the aminoglycoside paromomycin, were undertaken. The simulations give insight on the stability of the hydrogen bonding network established between the RNA and the drug by suggesting that the most stable interactions involve the conserved neamine part (rings I and II) while the interactions involving the additional rings III and IV are more fragile. Hence, it appears that not only the number of contacts established between the antibiotic and the

RNA diminishes when moving from the neamine part toward ring III and IV, but their stability diminishes as well, confirming the neamine fragment in its anchor role. Numerous strong hydration sites accepting long-resident water molecules could also be characterized at the RNA/drug interface. The associated water-mediated interactions certainly play a key role in the recognition phenomena, different from that played by bulk water or even by more easily "displaceable" water molecules. The knowledge of the position and dynamical characteristics of the water molecules located at the RNA/drug interface will certainly be useful for the design of new and more efficient drugs. In addition, this study addressed several important methodological issues among which the role of MMD simulations in order to detect structural biases introduced by medium resolution RNA structures [50]. Indeed, progress in our understanding of molecular recognition processes are intimately linked to methodological considerations.
