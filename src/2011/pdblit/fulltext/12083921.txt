Abstract: Incubation of farnesyl diphosphate (1) with the W308F or W308F/H309F mutants of pentalenene synthase, an enzyme from Streptomyces UC5319, yielded pentalenene (2), accompanied by varying proportions of (+)-germacrene A (7) with relatively minor changes in kcat and kcat/Km. By contrast, single H309 mutants gave rise to both (+)-germacrene A (7) and protoilludene (8) in addition to pentalenene (2). Mutation to glutamate of each of the three aspartate residues in the Mg2+-binding aspartate-rich domain, 80 DDLFD, resulted in reduction in the kcat/Km for farnesyl diphosphate and formation of varying proportions of pentalenene and (+)-germacrene A (7). Formation of (+)-germacrene A (7) by the various pentalenene synthase mutants is the result of a derailment of the natural anti-Markovnikov cyclization reaction, and not simply the consequence of trapping of a normally cryptic, carbocationic intermediate. Both the N219A and N219L mutants of pentalenene synthase were completely inactive, while the corresponding N219D mutant had a kcat/Km which was 3300-fold lower than that of the wild-type synthase, and produced a mixture of pentalenene (2) (91%) and the aberrant cyclization product -caryophyllene (9) (9%). Finally, the F77Y mutant had a kcat/Km which was reduced by 20-fold compared to that of the wild-type synthase.

Sesquiterpene synthases are a remarkably versatile family of enzymes that catalyze the cyclization of a single acyclic precursor, farnesyl diphosphate (1, FPP), to any of 300 known sesquiterpene hydrocarbons or alcohols.1 The closely related monoterpene synthases cyclize geranyl diphosphate (GPP), the C10 acyclic homologue of FPP, to a variety of monocyclic and bicylic monoterpenes, using variations of the same ionizationcyclization mechanism.2 The enzymes do not require any organic or inorganic cofactor other than a divalent cation, with Mg2+ or, in some cases, Mn2+ usually being preferred. The proteins themselves are usually monomers, or occasional homodimers, with subunit molecular weights of 40-65 kDa. Each multistep cyclization reaction normally takes place within a single active site without release of free intermediates. Pentalenene synthase is a typical sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent cyclization of farnesyl diphos* To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: David_Cane@ brown.edu.

Polar residues at the top are believed to be involved in binding of Mg2+ and the pyrophosphate moiety of the FPP substrate, while aromatic residues deeper in the active site cleft provide a hydrophobic surface for the farnesyl residue and stabilize carbocation intermediates. View is from the side, with opening of active site at the top of the figure.

View is from the top of the active site cavity, with the aspartate-rich domain on the right.

FPP,3,7 is believed to involve initial ionization of the pyrophosphate moiety followed by attack of the resulting allylic cation at C-11 of the distal double bond to give the humulyl cation 3 (Scheme 1). Rearrangement of 3 to the isomeric humulyl cation 4, either by a 1,2-hydride shift or by a deprotonationreprotonation sequence, is followed by cyclization to the secoilludyl cation 5. Hydride shift, cyclization, and stereospecific removal of the H-7re proton from the penultimate tricyclic intermediate 6 yields pentalenene. The cyclization is prototypical of all sesquiterpene cyclizations. With the availability of numerous cloned sesquiterpene and monoterpene synthases, the role of each cyclase in catalyzing the formation of its characteristic terpenoid product has been the object of considerable speculation and intensive study. In each case, the cyclase protein is believed to bind and fold the acyclic substrate FPP (or GPP) in a specific conformation and to initiate cyclization by ionization of the allylic diphosphate moiety, assisted by Mg2+ or another divalent cation. Crystal structures of four different sesquiterpene cyclasesspentalenene synthase from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces UC5319, trichodiene synthase and aristolochene synthase from the filamentous fungi Fusarium sporotrichioides and Penicillium roqueforti, respectively, and epi-aristolochene synthase from the tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum8shave indicated a remarkably high degree of conservation in the three-dimensional structures of all synthases, despite an essentially complete lack of overall amino acid sequence similarity among any of these proteins.9

This conserved topology, which consists entirely of R-helices connected by short peptide loops, has been termed the class I R-helical terpenoid cyclase fold.8c Interestingly, the same fold is also observed for avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase10 and human squalene synthase,11 two enzymes which catalyze mechanistically analogous reactions of allylic diphosphate substrates. The active sites of all of these enzymes consist of a conical and hydrophobic active site cleft, flanked by six or seven helices and lined with an unusual number of aromatic and nonpolar amino acid residues (Figure 1A). In the case of pentalenene synthase, the cleft is approximately 9 Å wide and 15 Å deep.8a The aromatic side chains are thought to play a critical role in shaping the active site and specifically stabilizing the succession of carbocationic intermediates that are generated in the course of each cyclization.12 Stabilization of the carbocations is further enhanced by the negative electrostatic charge of the interior surface of the active site (Figure 1B). Near the upper edge of the active site cavity of each synthase, located at the C-terminal end of an R-helix, is a universally conserved aspartate-rich motif, DDXXD, that has been implicated in the binding of the pyrophosphate moiety of the substrate through chelation of the requisite divalent cation.1,2,10,13,14 On the
(9) Although sesquiterpene synthases of microbial origin generally show no significant overall sequence similarity either to one another or to any other class of proteins (except for orthologs biosynthesizing the same sesquiterpene product), the dozens of known monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and diterpene synthases from plant sources have strongly conserved primary amino acid sequences as well as a common intron organization and exon size, consistent with a common evolutionary origin (cf.: Trapp, S. C.; Croteau, R. B. Genetics 2001, 158, 811-832.) It is highly likely, therefore, that all such plant terpene synthases will have the same topology as epiaristolochene synthase. (10) Tarshis, L.

proportions of two sesquiterpene hydrocarbons which we identified as germacrene A (7) and protoilludene (8)16 (Scheme 2). Both of these latter compounds result from derailment of the normal cyclization cascade, presumably due to relaxed control over the conformations of the substrate FPP and the derived carbocationic intermediates in the active sites of the various H309 mutants. We now report the results of site-directed mutagenesis of additional active site residues that shed light on the mechanism of action of pentalenene synthase.
Results

opposite wall is found another highly conserved triad of amino acid side chains, (D/N)DXX(S/T)XXXE, that also plays an important role in Mg2+ binding8b,d,15 (Figure 1A). Despite the increasing amount of structural information, little is known about the precise manner by which pentalenene synthase and related terpene cyclases impose a specific conformation on their acyclic, lipophilic substrates or trigger the ionization of the allylic diphosphate, how they mediate the resultant cascade of electrophilic reactions, or how they determine the timing and stereochemistry of the quenching of the carbocationic intermediates, either by removal of a specific proton or by capture by an external nucleophile such as water. In the crystal structure of pentalenene synthase, the only apparent basic residue in the active site cavity is histidine-3098a (Figure 1A). Modeling of both FPP and derived intermediates into the active site originally led us to suggest that the imidazole side chain of H309 might serve as the functional active site base that mediates the postulated series of deprotonations and reprotonations, including the final deprotonation that generates pentalenene. This inference was firmly excluded, however, when site-directed mutagenesis showed that H309 is not required for catalytic activity.16 Indeed, the H309A, H309C, H309S, and H309F mutants all retained substantial pentalenene synthase activity, with relatively minor decreases in kcat ranging from as little as 3-fold for H309A and H309S to at most 17-fold for the H309F mutant, accompanied by only minor increases in Km for three of the mutants (Table 1). On the other hand, each of these mutants was found to produce up to 20% of varying

(16) Portions of this work dealing with the H309A, H309S, H309C, and H309F mutants have been published in preliminary form.

Active Site Base. Having ruled out H309 as the active site base, we turned our attention to other plausible amino acid candidates. Unfortunately, no other nominally basic amino acids are present in the active site. The various arginine and lysine residues (R157, R173, K226, and K230) which are present along the upper region of the active site cavity are expected to be present in their protonated, positively charged form and are thought to play a role in binding of the pyrophosphate moiety of the substrate, rather than as Lewis bases. We therefore had to consider other, less conventional, possibilities. A tryptophan residue has previously been suggested as a possible active site base for epi-aristolochene synthase.8d Noting that pentalenene synthase also has a tryptophan residue (W308) immediately adjacent to the previously examined H309 (Figure 1A), we generated two pentalenene synthase mutants in which this tryptophan was replaced by phenylalanine, W308F, and the double mutant W308F/H308F (Table 1). Each of these mutant proteins was purified to homogeneity, and the steady-state kinetic parameters were determined, as previously described for the wild-type recombinant synthase. Both mutants retained substantial pentalenene synthase activity, with kcat lowered by a factor of only 4-12 and an overall reduction in kcat/Km of between 2 and 25. Interestingly, the W308F/H309F double mutant was actually slightly more active than the single H309F mutant. Unlike the simple H309 mutants, however, neither W308 mutant produced detectable protoilludene (8). Instead, the W308F and W308F/H309F mutants generated a mixture of pentalenene (2) and 7% and 25% of (+)-germacrene A (7), respectively, with the double mutant producing an additional 13% of equal quantities of two as-yet unidentified sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The absolute configuration of the enzymatically generated (+)-germacrene A (7) was established by means of its facile Cope rearrangement to (-)- -elemene (9), a reaction

The (-)- -elemene (9) produced in each rearrangement was identified by direct comparison with an authentic (-)- -elemene standard by chiral capillary GC-MS.18 All of the previously described single H309 mutants were also shown to produce (+)-germacrene (7). Aspartate-Rich Domain. To explore the role of the aspartaterich domain of pentalenene synthase, each of the three aspartate residues was separately replaced by a glutamate. The D80E mutant suffered a 150-fold decrease in kcat as well as a more than 20-fold increase in Km, resulting in a net decrease in kcat/ Km of 3.5 × 103 (Table 1). Interestingly, despite the substantial reduction in catalytic efficiency compared to the efficiency of the wild-type synthase, the sole product generated by the D80E mutant was pentalenene. By contrast, the D81E mutant, which exhibited a 400-fold reduction in kcat/Km compared to the wild type's value, due to a combination of a nearly 50-fold decrease in kcat and a 9-fold increase in Km, generated a mixture of 92% pentalenene and 4.5% germacrene A (7), accompanied by an additional 3.5% of an as-yet unidentified sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, m/z 204. Finally, the D84E mutant, which displayed relative minor changes in steady-state parameters (2.5-fold increase in measured kcat offset by a 7-fold increase in Km), generated a 97:3 mixture of pentalenene and 7. Asparagine-219. We have previously noted that the side chain of asparagine-219 protrudes into the active site cavity of pentalenene synthase8a (Figure 1A).

enforcing a specific folding on the substrate, FPP, and possibly by stabilizing transient cations by dipole-cation interactions. Structural studies of both epi-aristolochene synthase8d and trichodiene synthase,8b however, suggest that the carbonyl oxygen of the side chain amide of N219 in pentalenene synthase is part of a highly conserved Mg2+-binding triad that also includes the side chain oxygen atoms of serine-223 and glutamate-227. Accordingly, we generated both the isosteric N219L mutant and the corresponding N219A mutant (Table 1). Significantly, each of these mutants was completely inactive, within the limits of detection of the assay, which could have measured a reduction in kcat of as much as a factor of 105. To probe further the structural basis for the loss of activity associated with replacement of N219, and to verify that the loss of activity of the N219L mutant was not due to loss of structural integrity of the pentalenene synthase active site, we solved the crystal structure of the N219L mutant and compared it to that of the wild-type pentalenene synthase. Attempts to also obtain crystals of the N219L mutant with bound FPP were unsuccessful. The electron density map of N219L pentalenene synthase, shown in Figure 2A, reveals clear electron density for the substituted leucine side chain. Moreover, the superposition of N219L pentalenene synthase with wild-type pentalenene synthase, illustrated in Figure 2B, reveals that the nominally isosteric amino acid substitution does not result in any significant conformational changes for neighboring residues in the enzyme active site, indicating that the active site contour appears to be conserved in the mutant despite the replacement of the neutral but polar side chain of N219 with the hydrophobic leucine residue.8a Overall, the final refined structure of N219L pentalenene synthase at 2.9 Å is very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Figures 2B and 3). There are, however, some minor but interesting differences in the upper active site region when the two structures are compared. In the wild-type pentalenene synthase structure, the F158-D164 polypeptide loop connecting helices F and G at the rim of the active site is disordered in both monomers, A and B, of the asymmetric unit.8a In monomer A of the N219L mutant, this polypeptide loop is similarly

disordered, while in monomer B, the corresponding polypeptide loop is fully ordered in the electron density map. As a consequence, segmental shifts of R-helical segments in the region of this loop are evident in the superposition of monomers B in the wild-type pentalenene synthase and N219L mutant structures: 1-2 Å segmental shifts are greatest for the upper part of helices G and H (starting at the site of the N219L substitution on helix H) and for all of helix I (Figure 3). Although it is likely that these structural changes occur in monomer B as a consequence of the N219L substitution on helix H, it is not clear why these structural changes are observed only in monomer B of the asymmetric unit and not in monomer A of the mutant. Neither the wild-type protein nor the N219L mutant shows any bound Mg2+, similar to free aristolochene synthase8c and trichodiene synthase,8b but in contrast to epiaristolochene synthase.8d The majority of plant sesquiterpene and monoterpene synthases have an aspartate instead of an asparagine in the conserved Mg2+-binding triad at the position corresponding to N219 of pentalenene synthase. Reasoning that some or all of the original cyclase activity might be retained when asparagine was replaced with aspartate, we also prepared the N219D mutant. The latter variant indeed showed pentalenene synthase activity, albeit at a lower level than wild-type, with a 60-fold decrease in kcat and a 55-fold increase in the Km for FPP, resulting in a ca. 3300-fold decrease in kcat/Km. Intriguingly, the N219D mutant produced 9% of a new hydrocarbon which was shown to be identical by GC-MS with an authentic sample of -caryophyllene (10) (Scheme 4). Neither of the previously observed derailment products, 7 or 8, were observed in incubations with N219D. The formation of -caryophyllene (10) is readily explained by an alternative cyclization of the normal humulyl cation intermediate 3 and removal of a proton from the methyl group of the resulting bicyclic cation 11. Aromatic Residues. Among the many aromatic residues which line the active site of pentalenene synthase, two of these,

phenylalanines-76 and -77, are found on helix D, immediately below the aspartate-rich domain, with the faces of the phenyl rings angled toward the active site in a sort of open-faced sandwich (Figure 1A). Although both the F76A and F77A mutants were constructed, the resultant proteins were obtained in low yield and primarily as insoluble inclusion bodies, even when lower temperatures and reduced concentrations of IPTG were used for induction of protein expression. On the basis of experiments with partially purified soluble components of each mutant extract, the activity of each mutant was estimated as no more than 10% that of the wild-type enzyme, and probably considerably less. Attempted solubilization and refolding of the F76A mutant gave only inactive protein. On the other hand, the F77Y mutant was readily expressed and purified in soluble form. The kcat and the kcat/Km of the F77Y mutant were 20-fold lower than those of the wild-type pentalenene synthase (Table 1). The latter mutant produced predominantly pentalenene (2), along with very minor amounts of as-yet unidentified sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, none of which corresponded to either germacrene A or protoilludene.
Discussion

Active Site Base. In the crystal structure of pentalenene synthase, the only apparent basic residue in the active site cavity is histidine-3098a (Figure 1A). This observation originally led us to suggest that the imidazole side chain of H309 might serve as the functional active site base, an inference which was firmly excluded, however, when site-directed mutagenesis showed that His309 is not required for catalytic activity.16 Although the H309A, H309C, H309S, and H309F mutants all retained substantial pentalenene synthase activity, each of these mutants was found to produce up to 20% of varying proportions of two sesquiterpene hydrocarbons identified as (+)-germacrene A (7) and protoilludene (8). The formation of protoilludene (8) by each of these mutants is readily explained by direct cyclization of the natural seco-illudyl cation intermediate 5 followed by deprotonation of the resulting tricyclic protoilludyl cation (12) (Scheme 2). Protoilludene (8) has previously been isolated from cultures of Fomitopsis insularis that produce the structurally related sesquiterpene fomannosin.19 Formation of germacrene A (7) requires an anomalous Markovnikov cyclization of the originally generated allylic cation at C-10 of the 10,11-double bond of FPP, followed by deprotonation of one of the two attached methyl groups (Scheme 2). Germacrene A (7) is itself a common sesquiterpene metabolite that has also been implicated as an intermediate in the formation of a wide variety of bicyclic eudesmane, eremophilane, and vetispirane sesquiterpenes, including both aristolochene and epi-aristolochene.1,18,20 Notably, the formation of the (+)-enantiomer of 7 is consistent with the

well-documented absolute sense of folding of FPP in the formation of pentalenene. Both anomalous cyclization products, (+)-germacrene A (7) and protoilludene (8), result from derailment of the normal cyclization cascade, presumably due to relaxed control over the conformation of the substrate FPP and derived intermediates in the active sites of the various H309 mutants. In their analysis of the structure of epi-aristolochene synthase, Chappell and Noel had postulated that an active site tryptophan (W273) might serve as a Lewis base, reasoning that the indole ring is intrinsically reactive toward acid and other electrophilic reagents.8d,21 In support of this suggestion, they reported that replacement of W273 by either aromatic or nonaromatic amino acid residues abolished cyclase activity in the epi-aristolochene synthase. Since pentalenene synthase has a tryptophan residue (W308) immediately adjacent to the previously examined His309, we generated two mutant pentalenene synthases in which this tryptophan was replaced by phenylalanine, W308F, and the double mutant, W308F/H308F (Table 1). Both mutants retained substantial pentalenene synthase activity. Although neither mutant produced detectable protoilludene (8), the W308F and W308F/H309F mutants also generated varying proportions of (+)-germacrene A (7). Together these experiments firmly exclude either histidine-309 or tryptophan-308 as the active site base for pentalenene synthase. Deprotonation of the carbocationic intermediates of terpenoid cyclization does not require an especially potent base, since tertiary carbocations are highly acidic, with estimated pKa values in the range of -10.22 The stereospecific removal of H-7re of 6 that generates pentalenene (2) is certainly not a spontaneous chemical event and is presumably mediated by a discrete, dedicated active site base. It is geometrically unlikely, however, that this same base can also mediate each of the anomalous deprotonations that generate the various derailment products such as germacrene A, protoilludene, and -caryophyllene. Since we have ruled out the only nominally basic residues present in the active site, His309 and the adjacent Trp308, as active site bases, how can one now account for the action of apparently multiple bases? At least three possibilities must be considered: (1) The base or bases could be enzyme-bound water(s), given that the pKa of the conjugate acid H3O+ is -2 to -4.22 A potential drawback to water acting as the active site base, however, is its intrinsic nucleophilicity, which could lead to the competing formation of alcohol side products, none of which are observed for either the wild-type cyclase or any of the mutants examined. In principle, this nucleophilicity could be suppressed if the bound water were to be tightly constrained within the active site. So far, there is no crystallographic evidence for or against the presence of water bound at the active site in the presence of substrates or analogues. (2) The carbonyl oxygen atoms of the peptide backbone are also basic enough (pKa of protonated amide ) 0 to -2)22 to accept a proton from the C-7 methylene group of 6 and other cationic intermediates.

(3) Finally, the active site base might be the tightly bound pyrophosphate counterion.23 It is not immediately clear, however, that this group would be capable of reaching all of the various sites of deprotonation that lead to the formation of pentalenene and its three identified derailment products. Resolution of these issues will require high-resolution crystal structures of protein bound to substrate or intermediate analogues. Binding of the Divalent Cation. The aspartate-rich domain, which is universally conserved in all terpene synthases, has been shown to play an important role in binding of the requisite divalent cation, which is usually Mg2+.1,2,10,13,14 Crystal structures of both epi-aristolochene synthase with a bound FPP analogue,8d as well as of trichodiene synthase with bound inorganic pyrophosphate,8b have revealed that, in fact, three Mg2+ ions are bound at the active site, two of which are liganded, either directly or indirectly, by two or more of the carboxylates of the DDXXD motif. These two Mg2+ ions in turn form a complex with the pyrophosphate moiety of the substrate. Together with a third magnesium ion, which is held on the opposite side of the pyrophosphate group by the (N/D)DXX(S/T)XXXE triad of amino acid side chains, the divalent metal ions serve to bind and orient the pyrophosphate group of the substrate FPP, while simultaneously activating the allylic diphosphate moiety for the ionization that initiates the cascade of electrophilic cyclization reactions. Consistent with this model, replacement of the individual aspartate residues in each of two aspartate-rich domains in the active site of farnesyl diphosphate synthase resulted in nearly complete loss of prenyl transferase activity.24 By contrast, the corresponding D100E, D101E, and D104E mutants of trichodiene synthase display only modest changes in steady-state kinetic parameters (but up to 100-fold decreases in the slowest chemical step, that of FPP ionization), while generating a mixture of five anomalous sesquiterpene cyclization products in addition to the normal cyclization product, trichodiene.14 Recent crystallographic studies of the D100E mutant of trichodiene synthase with bound inorganic pyrophosphate have revealed that the complex coordinates only two of the three Mg2+ ions and that the volume of the active site cavity has increased some 12%, from 324 to 364 Å3, allowing for greater spatial and conformational degrees of freedom in the binding of the substrate and derived intermediates.8b For pentalenene synthase, the D80E, D81E, and D84E mutants also show an analogous degradation in catalytic power and product specificity, although there is no simple correlation between the magnitude of the change in steady-state kinetic parameters and the relative proportions of abortive cyclization products. Since release of the final sesquiterpene products is likely to be rate-limiting, as has been demonstrated for both trichodiene synthase and epi-aristolochene synthase,25 even a 10-fold decrease in the rate of the slowest chemical step in the pentalenene synthase reaction sequence could well be masked by an even slower product-off step. Asparagine-219 of pentalenene synthase is part of a highly conserved motif, (L,V)(I,V,L)(N,D)D(I,L,V)A(S,T)XXXE, that

is found in all monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and diterpene synthases.15 Both N225 of trichodiene synthase8b and D445 of epi-aristolochene synthase,8d each of which is known to be chelated to a Mg2+ ion, are found at nearly identical positions within the active sites of their respective enzymes as N219 and N244 of pentalenene and aristolochene synthase, and all four residues have their side chain carbonyl groups oriented in the same manner. Consistent with the expected role of N219 in binding Mg2+, the corresponding N219A and N219L mutants of pentalenene synthase are both completely inactive. Analysis of the crystal structure of the latter mutant reveals no significant changes in protein structure or in the shape of the active site (Figures 2 and 3). Notably, we have also recently found that the N244L mutant of aristolochene synthase is inactive, as predicted.26 Croteau has recently reported that the homologous N765A mutant of abietadiene synthase, a diterpene synthase originally isolated from grand fir (Abies grandis), suffers a more than 20 000-fold decrease in kcat compared to the value for the wild type, while substitution of alanine for either T769 or E773, the other two components of the Mg2+-binding triad, reduced kcat by 10 000-fold and 5000-fold, respectively.27 On the other hand, replacement of N219 of pentalenene synthase with aspartate, the amino acid that is found at the homologous position of the majority of plant monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and diterpene synthases, restores pentalenene synthase activity to ca. 0.03% of its wild-type level, while resulting in concomitant formation of the anomalous side-product -caryophyllene (10) (Scheme 4). Carbocation Stabilization. Both theoretical and experimental studies have provided support for the importance of aromatic amino acid residues in stabilizing carbocations at enzyme active sites.12 Among the many aromatic residues that can be seen within the active site of pentalenene synthase, F76 and F77 appear to be well placed so as to interact with positive charge at C-1, C-2, and C-3 of the farnesyl residue and derived intermediates (Figure 1A). Replacement of either F76 or F77 by alanine led to at least a 10-fold reduction in catalytic activity, but the low yield and poor solubility of the mutant proteins precluded more quantitative analysis of the steady-state kinetic parameters. Mutant F77Y, in which the phenylalanine is replaced by a more electron-rich tyrosine residue, produced predominantly pentalenene, with essentially no change in Km compared to the value for the wild type but with kcat reduced by a factor of 20, suggesting that the precise geometry of interaction of the aromatic residues with the intermediate carbocations is critical to enhancement of the rate of the reaction. The currently accepted mechanism for the pentalenene synthase reaction involves ionization of the substrate FPP and electrophilic attack of C-1 of the initially generated allylic cation at C-11 of the 10,11-double bond of FPP to give the secondary humulyl cation 3 (Scheme 5, pathway a). This anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry contrasts with solution-phase reactions in which electrophilic additions normally occur at the less substituted end of a double bond to give the more highly substituted, thermodynamically more stable carbocation. In those mutants of pentalenene synthase in which (+)-germacrene A (7) is generated in addition to pentalenene, formation of 7 results from competing Markovnikov addition to C-10 of the 10,11-double

bond and deprotonation of the resulting tertiary cation 13 (Scheme 5, pathways b and c). Is formation and trapping of the germacradienyl cation 13 an anomalous process that occurs in competition with direct formation of the humulyl cation 3 only in pentalenene synthase mutants in which the substrate is anomalously bound, or is the germacradienyl cation 13 a natural, but normally cryptic, intermediate of the wild-type cyclization reaction, that ordinarily undergoes rapid Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement (Scheme 5, pathway d) to the secondary humulyl cation 3? The apparent selective formation of the nominally less stable, anti-Markovnikov addition product is, in fact, a very common theme in the biosynthesis of cyclic terpenoids, from monoterpenes to triterpenes.1,2,28 This apparent divergence from ordinary solution or gas-phase kinetic behavior has motivated a variety of proposals to account for the apparently divergent chemistry of enzyme-catalyzed terpene synthase reactions. For example, on the basis of extensive studies of the cyclization of heteroatom-substituted squalene analogues by lanosterol synthase, Corey and others have argued that, in the generation of ring C of steroids and other triterpenes, the apparent direct, antiMarkovnikov cyclization of the bicyclic intermediate 14 leading to the formation of the tricyclic secondary cation 15 (Figure 4A, pathway a) can be avoided if one posits an initial Markovnikov cyclization of 14 to generate the tertiary cyclopentylcarbinyl cation 1629 (Figure 4A, pathway b). The latter intermediate would then undergo ring expansion to generate the secondary cyclohexyl cation 15 (Figure 4A, pathway c). Detailed calculations carried out by Jorgensen, using both ab initio and molecular mechanics methods to model the cyclizationrearrangement in a condensed phase designed to mimic the environment of aromatic residues thought to be at the active site of lanosterol synthase, predicted that direct Markovnikov cyclization of 14 to 16 would be exothermic by > -8 kcal/ mol, while subsequent rearrangement of 16 to the secondary cation 15 would be endothermic by 12 kcal/mol.30 These results were interpreted as being consistent with the cyclizationrearrangement pathway proposed by Corey. On the other hand, since the free energy of the ultimately formed secondary cation 15 cannot depend on the pathway by which it is formed, generation of 15 from the hypothetical Markovnikov intermediate 16 must be at least 8 kcal/mol more endothermic than direct

generation of 15 from 14 by the supposedly forbidden antiMarkovnikov process. In fact, the calculations themselves show the tricyclic secondary cation 15 to be no more than 4 kcal/mol higher in free energy than the bicyclic precursor 14, most of the driving force for the reaction coming from the net conversion of a double bound to a single bond. There is thus no direct experimental evidence or theoretical support for an intrinsic thermodynamic (or, more importantly, kinetic) advantage to the proposed two-step cyclization-rearrangement process; indeed, such a pathway would require a thermodynamically unfaVorable rearrangement step after the hypothetical Markovnikov cyclization. To address the issue of competing formation of Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov products during enzyme-catalyzed terpenoid biosynthesis, we have previously used the powerful technique of isotopically sensitive branching.31 (-)-Pinene synthase is a monoterpene synthase which converts geranyl diphosphate to a mixture of several monoterpenes, including (-)-R-pinene, (-)- -pinene, and (-)-camphene.32 Cyclization of a deuterated sample of GPP resulted in an increase in the ratio of R-pinene to -pinene, due to the isotope effect on removal of deuterium from the methyl group of the common bicyclic intermediate pinanyl cation 17, without perturbing the ratio of total R- and -pinenes to camphene31 (Figure 4B). These results established that the commitment to formation of camphene must take place before the isotopically sensitive step and that cyclization of the R-terpinyl cation 18 therefore involves competing Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov cyclizations. Had only Markovnikov cyclization of the R-terpinyl cation been allowed, camphene would have had to be formed by rearrangement of the common pinanyl cation intermediate 17 to the bornyl cation 19 (Figure 4B, pathway c), rather than by direct formation of 19 from the R-terpinyl cation (Figure 4B, pathway b). In such a case, the deuterium isotope effect would have increased the proportion of both camphene and R-pinene relative to -pinene. To our knowledge, the isotopically sensitive branching experiment is by far the clearest and least ambiguous demonstration that there is no intrinsic prohibition against enzymecatalyzed anti-Markovnikov reactions. Such "disfavored" electrophilic additions are presumably facilitated by specific enzymic stabilization of the nominally less stable transition state leading to the secondary carbocationic intermediate. In the pentalenene

synthase-catalyzed cyclization of FPP, formation of the secondary humulyl cation 3 is therefore expected to take place directly, without intervention of the otherwise more stable germacradienyl cation 13 (Scheme 5). Formation of (+)-germacrene A (7) by the various pentalenene synthase mutants is thus a true derailment or diversion of the normal cyclization reaction, and not simply the consequence of trapping of a normally cryptic, cationic intermediate.
Experimental Section
Materials. Sources of reagents and chromatographic materials were as previously described.6 Expression, purification, and assay of recombinant pentalenene synthase from E. coli BL21(DE3)/pZW05 was perfomed as described.6 Authentic -caryophyllene was obtained from Sigma. Mutagenic oligonucleotides and primers were purchased from IDT. The Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System and competent cells of ES1301mutS and JM109 were obtained from Promega, while E. coli BL21(DE3) was purchased from Stratagene. EcoRI, HindIII, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Stratagene, and AgeI, PpuMI, SacI, and EcoNI were from New England Biolabs. Plasmid DNA purification was performed using the QIAprep spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). General Methods. Restriction endonuclease digestions, DNA ligations, transformation of competent cells, plasmid minipreps, mutagenesis, and other standard recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out by standard methods and according to the suppliers' protocols. dsDNA sequencing was performed by the HHMI Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at the Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, using the dideoxy dye terminator method and automated fluorescence sequencing. Analysis of DNA and protein sequences as well as PCR primer design utilized the suite of programs in the Wisconsin sequence analysis package, version 10.0 (Unix), Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI. Pentalenene Synthase Mutants. The EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pZW05 which harbors the wild-type pentalenene synthase gene6 was ligated into the Promega vector pALTER-1, and mutations were introduced using the Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis system in combination with the mutagenic primers listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. Mutant plasmids were initially screened by restriction digestion to verify the loss or introduction of any relevant restriction sites (Table S1, Supporting Information). The identities of each of the mutations were then directly verified by sequencing of the full-length gene. Each of the mutant genes was then excised by EcoRIHindIII digestion, ligated back into the T7-based expression plasmid pLM1, and subcloned in E. coli XL1 Blue. The resultant mutant plasmids were then used to transform the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3). Protein Overexpression and Kinetic Studies.

This culture (10 mL) was used to inoculate 500 mL of the same media which was grown for 3 h until OD600 > 0.8. The culture was transferred to a bath at 30 °C, and after 30 min enzyme production was induced using 0.5 mM IPTG for 3 h. After centrifugation (6000g, 25 min), 2.8 g of cells was typically obtained. Lysis of the cells, DNAse treatment, and sonication were performed as for wild-type pentalenene synthase.6 After PEG precipitation of the undesired proteins and centrifugation (9500g, 20 min), the mutant pentalenene synthase was purified as previously described.6 Kinetic assays were performed as previously described for wild-type pentalenene synthase, except that different ranges of concentration for [1-3H]FPP were used to compensate for the variations in Km. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by direct fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear least-squares regression using the commercial Kaleidagraph software package. Mutant Product Analysis. In a typical incubation reaction, 100 µg of purified enzyme was incubated with FPP (50 µM) in a total volume of 1 mL supplemented with kinetics buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM benzamidine, 20% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.2) at 30 °C for 1 h, and the aqueous layer was overlaid with 2 mL of HPLC grade pentane. The hydrocarbon products were extracted twice with 1 mL of pentane. The organic layer was concentrated to about 100 µL under reduced pressure at 0 °C. The concentrate was analyzed by GC-MS using a HP-5988A GC-MS system containing a HP-1 column and running the following heating program: 55 °C for 4 min and then 5 °C/min until 210 °C with an injector temperature of 150 °C. Under those conditions, pentalenene (2), (+)-germacrene A (7), protoilludene (8), and -caryophyllene (9) eluted at 15.53, 19.33, 16.45, and 17.30 min, respectively. Determination of the Stereochemistry of Germacrene A. The germacrene samples from the H309F, H309S, H309C, W308F, and W308F/H309F mutants were each shown to correspond to (+)germacrene A (7). The absolute configuration of (+)-germacrene A was demonstrated by means of its Cope rearrangement to (-)- -elemene (9).17 The sample in hexane (2 µL) was analyzed by GC-MS (25 m × 0.25 mm i.d. heptakis(6-O-TBDMS-2,3-di-O-methyl)- -cyclodextrin (50% in OV17)) using an injection port temperature of 250 °C to induce the rearrangement of enzymatically produced (+)-germacrene A (7), with an oven temperature program of 4 min at 45 °C followed by a ramp of 2 °C min-1 to 170 °C. Spectra were recorded in the selected ion monitoring mode (m/z 121, 147, and 189). A racemic -elemene standard was isolated from the hydrodistillate of the liverwort Frullania macrocephalum, and the elution order of its enantiomers was determined with a (-)- -elemene standard.18 Under these conditions, (+)- -elemene and (-)- -elemene eluted at 31.82 and 31.97 min, respectively. Crystallography. Purified N219L pentalenene synthase was concentrated to 2-7 mg/mL using Centricon filter devices (Amicon) and used in sitting-drop batch crystallization trials at room temperature: various protein concentrations [2.0, 4.5, and 6.6 mg/mL N219L pentalenene synthase in 100 mM HEPES (pH ) 7.0)], protein solution volumes, and precipitant buffer volumes were sampled in 3 × 3 Pyrex (Corning) grids sealed in plastic containers and equilibrated against 35 mL of precipitant buffer [1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM TrisHCl (pH ) 8.2)]. The optimal composition of sitting drops was 40 µL of enzyme solution and 20 µL of precipitant buffer, which yielded hexagonal, rodlike crystals of approximate dimensions 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.4 mm within 3 weeks. These crystals were prepared for X-ray data collection by gradual transfer into a 30% glycerol cryoprotectant solution and flash-cooled in liquid propane for transport to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Beamline 7-1). X-ray diffraction data were collected using a MAR 345/CCD image plate system (300

Crystals of N219L pentalenene synthase were isomorphous with those of the wild-type enzyme.8a A total of 63 768 measured reflections yielded 23 110 unique reflections, 97% complete to 2.9 Å resolution (Rsym ) 0.083). Data integration and reduction was performed using the HKL program suite,33 and corrected structure factor amplitudes were generated with routines contained in the CCP4 program suite.34 Initial phases for the electron density map of N219L pentalenene synthase were obtained by molecular replacement against 20-4 Å data using routines contained in CNS35 and residues 9-304 of the wildtype pentalenene synthase crystallization dimer as a search probe.8a The cross-rotation function and subsequent translation searches yielded an unambiguous solution with a correlation coefficient significantly higher than those for all other solutions (0.436 with the next closest peak at 0.197): R ) 114.69°, ) 175.81°,  ) 52.28°, x ) 0.83, y ) -3.60, z ) -1.88. Rigid-body refinement lowered the initial R factor from 0.455 to 0.432, and subsequent refinement employed torsion angle dynamics with energy minimization (Tinitial ) 5000 K), using the maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in CNS.35 Model building was performed using O.36 Strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints and grouped B factors (one main chain and one side chain per residue) were initially imposed in refinement. However, improved convergence was achieved when a bulk solvent correction was applied, when restrained individual B factors were utilized, and when noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were converted to highly weighted restraints (w ) 100-300 kcal mol-1) in loop regions. Residues 7-311 were fit into the final electron density map along with a total of 26 water molecules. Refinement converged smoothly to a final crystallographic R factor of 0.263 (Rfree ) 0.308). The final model had excellent stereochemistry: root-mean-square (rms) deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles were 0.009 Å and 1.3°, respectively, and analysis with PROCHECK37 indicated 464, 48, and 2 nonproline/nonglycine residues in both molecules of the asymmetric unit with most favored, additionally allowed, and generously allowed backbone conformations, respectively. Refined atomic coordinates of N219L pentalenene synthase have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics with PDB accession code 1HM7.
