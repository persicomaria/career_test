The tertiary structure of the non-crystallizable two-electron-reduced Megasphaera elsdenii flavodoxin (15 kDa, 137 amino acid residues) has been determined using nuclear Overhauser enhancement restraints extracted from two-dimensional 'H-NMR spectra. A tertiary structure satisfying the experimental restraints very well (maximum NOE violation of 66 pm) was obtained with use of restrained molecular dynamics, using 509 distance restraints (including one non-NOE) on a starting structure modeled from the crystal structure of one-electron-reduced Clostridium M P flavodoxin. The protein consists of a central parallel j-sheet surrounded on both sides by two c(helices. The flavin is positioned at the periphery of the molecule. The tertiary structure of the protein is highly defined with the exception of the flavin. The latter is expected to result from performing the restrained molecular dynamics simulation without water molecules and without proper charges on the flavin. The flavin, including the phosphate, the ribityl side chain and the isoalloxazine ring, is solvent accessible under the experimental conditions used and evidenced by a two-dimensional amide exchange experiment. This accessibility is expected to be important in the redox potential regulation of the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple of the protein. The amide exchange against deuterons and several typical line shapes in the two-dimensional NMR spectra are consistent with the structure generated. The structure is discussed in detail. Flavodoxins are low-potential electron-transfer proteins which have been found in several strains of bacteria and algae. The flavodoxins comprise a group of small monomeric proteins with molecular masses ranging over 14 - 23 kDa containing non-covalently bound riboflavin 5'-phosphate (FMN) as prosthetic group. The chemical and physical properties have been intensively studied (for a review see [l]). The crystal structures of three flavodoxins have been determined: Clostridium M P flavodoxin in the oxidized (0.19-nm resolution) and the one-electron-reduced-state (0.18-nm resolution, 138 amino acid residues) [2-41, Desulfovihrio vulgaris flavodoxin in the oxidized state (0.2-nm resolution, 148 amino acid residues) [5] and Anacystis nidulans flavodoxin in the oxidized state (0.25-nm resolution, 169 amino acid residues) [6 - 81. These three proteins are typical a/P proteins having a parallel P-sheet consisting of five strands as a core. The threedimensional structures are quite similar, A . nidulans flavodoxin having an insertion of 20 residues in the fifth strand of the parallel j?-sheet distinguishing it from the other two flavodoxins [S]. The conformation of the flavin-binding region in these three flavodoxins, the main region of interest concerning the tuning of the redox potential, differs significantly however [6]. The flavin is positioned at the periphery of the three flavodoxins. Some results regarding the shape of the dihydroisoalloxazine, the positions of three atom groups (S7 OH, S87 OH and the carbonyl group of G57) and the sidechain positions of E59, M56 and W90 of two-electron-reduced Clostridium M P flavodoxin have also been published [4]. We have studied the noncrystallizable flavodoxin of Megasphaera elsdenii using various NMR techniques. In vivo, M . elsdenii flavodoxin shuttles between the semiquinone (oneelectron-reduced) and the hydroquinone (two-electron-reduced) states as a result of the absence of a high activation barrier between these two redox states [9]. It is the absence of this activation barrier that predestinates the protein for oneelectron transfer reactions. One-dimensional NMR results using I3C- and "Nenriched flavins, probing the electronic and conformational structure of the flavin, showed that the flavin binding regions of M . elsdenii and Clostridium M P flavodoxin are very similar [lo-121. In an initial two-dimensional NMR study on M . elsdenii flavodoxin it appeared possible to assign (partly) four amino acid residues in the immediate neighbourhood of the flavin, thereby confirming earlier one-dimensional 'H-NMR assignments [lo, 13, 141. Recently, we have described the sequential assignments of the 'H-NMR spectrum of twoelectron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin (137 amino acid residues, 15 kDa) [15]. The secondary structure and the global Correspondence to J. Vervoort, Department of Biochemistry, fold of M . elsdenii flavodoxin were recently deduced from 2D Agricultural University, Dreyenlaan 3, NL-6703 HA Wageningen, NMR data [16]. In this paper we describe the tertiary solution The Netherlands structure of two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin Ahhreviutions. 2D, two-dimensional; NOESY, 2D nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; EM, energy minimization ; based on structural information previously gathered [I 5, 161 RMD, restrained molecular dynamics; RMS, root mean square; and restrained molecular dynamics (RMD) [17- 191 with inRMSD, root mean square difference.

[20 - 221 to arrive at a starting structure for the RMD calculations but followed a different procedure. For a few proteins of which no crystal structure is known the tertiary structure has been determined by NMR techniques. These include the lac repressor headpiece [18], insectotoxin 15A [23], proteinase inhibitor I1 from bull seminal plasma [24], phoratoxin [25], hirudin [26], human epidermal growth factor [27]. the globular domain of histone H5 [28], acyl carrier protein from Esclierichia coli [29] and human complement protein C5a [30].All of these proteins have molecular masses below 10 kDa. The determination of the tertiary structure of two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin with a molecular mass of 15 kDa therefore represents important progress in the determination of protein structures by NMR. MATERIALS AND METHODS distance ranges, 0 - 0.27 nm, 0 - 0.33 nm and 0 - 0.42 nm, corresponding to strong, medium and weak NOEs [24, 38, 391. For NOEs involving methyl groups an additional 0.05 nm was added to the upper distance limit to correct for the higher apparent intensity of the methyl resonance [26,40]. The initial list of 684 restraints was corrected after failure of the first RMD run, resulting in 619 restraints. For the final run, the NOE's have been thoroughly checked in the 50-ms NOESY spectrum to avoid restraints resulting purely from spin diffusion [41]; 133 restraints had to be discarded, resulting in a final list of 508 inter-residual restraints. One repulsive nonNOE restraint [42] in the flavin-binding region was considered to be relevant and included. No intraresidual NOE restraints or dihedral angle restraints were used. Attractive restraints between amide protons and carbonyl oxygens have not been used in order to preserve the secondary structure. For some proton/proton pairs, corrections have to be applied to the upper distance limit. This may arise in cases where protons cannot be distinguished in the NMR spectra, either because of the lack of stereo-specific assignments or because of rapid dynamic processes. In these cases the distance restraint must be applied to the average position (pseudo-atom) and the upper limit bound is corrected for the difference between the proton position and the actual pseudo-position [43]. A full description of the concept of the use of pseudoatoms as used in our calculations was published previously [44l. Molecular model A starting structure was modeled from the crystal structure of Clostridium M P flavodoxin in the semiquinone state by amino acid residue replacement, using the interactive graphic programs WHATIF [45] and FRODO [46]. These programs were also used when the structure was manually adjusted. Insertion of E3 in, and deletion of L115 and D3 26 from, the structure of Clostridium M P flavodoxin has been done to generate the starting structure of M . elsdenii flavodoxin. In order to remove high potential energies resulting from the model building on a graphics display system, the starting structure was relaxed by performing steepest descent energy minimization (EM) while the backbone atom positions were positionally restrained (in order to preserve the global fold). Every RMD run was preceded by EM without restraining positions, but using the distance restraints obtained from NMR with a distance restraint force constant of 250 kJ mol-' nm-'. Molecular dynamics using distance restraints RMD calculations, solving the classical Newtonian equations of motion of all atoms, are applied to the protein structure using a force field [44, 47, 481 of the form:

N M R spectroscopy
The NMR studies were done on M . elsdenii flavodoxin which was isolated and purified as previously described [31]. The NMR samples contained 6- 10 mM flavodoxin in solutions consisting of a mixture of 20% potassium pyrophosphate and 80% potassium phosphate with concentrations ranging over 75-200 mM, pH 8.3. For the tertiary structure determination, phase-sensitive NOESY spectra [32, 331 of the protein dissolved in a mixture of 20% 2Hz0/90% HzO, using timeproportional phase increments, were acquired at 41 "C with mixing times of 50,100 and 150 ms. The NOESY spectra were acquired on a Bruker AM600 operating at 600 MHz; no zero quantum filters were applied. Selective irradiation of the water resonance took place at all times, except during the data acquisition period; a relaxation delay of 2.5 s was used. After data acquisition, all further data handling was performed on a MicroVAX I1 computer and a VAXstation 2000 using software obtained from Dr R. Boelens, modified to our specific requirements. The NOESY data were digitally filtered using a sine bell shifted by 15.0" in the t z dimension and a squared sine bell shifted by 22.5" in t l dimension. After zero filling, the spectral resolution of the NOESY spectra was 4.1 Hz/point in the w 2 direction and 8.1 Hz/point in the w1 direction. Baseline corrections in both frequency directions were applied to she spectra using a fourth-order polynomial according to Pearson [34]. The spectra were plotted as contour plots (0.13 ppm/cm) with levels increasing by a factor of 1.3. Details concerning the 2D-NMR experiments for the sequential resonance assignments [35 - 381, in addition to the NOESY experiments described here, have been published previously [15, 161. Reduction of the protein was achieved by the addition of the desired amount of a dithionite solution to the anaerobic solution of oxidized flavodoxin. Anaerobic solutions were obtained by carefully flushing the flavodoxin solution in the NMR tube with argon for about 20 min. The desired degree of reoxidation was obtained by injecting small volumes of air into the NMR tube containing the flavohydroquinone solution followed by gentle mixing. Computational methods Distance restraints The 150-ms NOESY spectrum of two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin has been the basis for estimating interproton distances. NOE intensities were visually classified in three

describing the potential energy of the molecular system as a function of the positions ri of the N atoms labeled by the index i. The usual term for harmonic bond-stretching was omitted as all bonds were artificially constrained to constant length for efficient computing; this was done by use of the SHAKE procedure [49, 501. The first term in the above equation describes the harmonic bond-angle bending 0 around the opti-

187 ma1 angle Bo with force constant KO The second two terms describe the torsional or dihedral-angle interactions comprising a harmonic term for so-called improper dihedrals that preserve planarity and chirality (aromatic rings, C, carbons) and a term for dihedrals (4) that are allowed to make transitions. The fourth term represents the non-bonded interactions between pairs of atoms i and j with charges q j and q j at distances rij, containing the Van der Waals and the Coulomb interactions. The last term in the force field represents the 'non-physical' distance restraints resulting in forces that pull the atoms to the specified distance r$. The term has the following form [44] : /I-sheet consisting of the five strands mentioned already with the connectivity pattern 2-1-3-4-5. The /I-sheet forms the core of the protein and is surrounded by two a-helices on both sides: helices 1 and 4 on one side and helices 2 and 3 on the opposite side of the sheet. The flavin could be positioned using several NOE connectivities between the prosthetic group and the apoprotein. During every stage of the analysis of the 150-ms NOESY spectrum of two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin extensive use has been made of structural information already gathered. Inter-residual NOE connectivities consistent with this structural information could then be assigned unambiguously. Comparing the secondary structure elements and the global fold of two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin with the crystal structures of Clostridium M P flavodoxin (oxidized as well as one-electron-reduced), it became clear that there is a high structural similarity between both flavodoxins [16]. It was already concluded from previous I3C- and 15N-NMR studies that the FMN binding regions of M . elsdenii and Clostridium M P flavodoxin are remarkably similar [lo - 121. Moreover, the amino acid sequence similarity between M . elsdenii and Clostridium M P flavodoxin is 44%. The crystal structure of the one-electron-reduced Clostridium M P flavodoxin is assumed to be virtually identical to its twoelectron-reduced structure. Therefore the crystal structure of the semiquinone state of Clostridium M P flavodoxin was used to build a plausible starting structure for the RMD calculations on two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin. Following this procedure we circumvented the time-consuming [30] procedure, even for small proteins, of distance geometry methods [20 - 221. An RMD run was performed on the starting structure using 684 interresidual distance restraints, divided into three distance ranges corresponding to strong, medium and weak NOEs, obtained from the 150-ms NOESY spectra of flavodoxin. We aborted this RMD run after 30 ps of simulation since no convergence to a structure acceptably satisfying the restraints was obtained: 57 violations exceeding the NOE distance restraint with at least 0.14 nm were still present (Fig. 2). Checking all NOE restraints which give rise to violations exceeding 0.08 nm after 30 ps of RMD revealed the primary source of these violations: human mistakes. In tabulating a few thousand NOE cross peaks (including both interand intraresidual connectivities) several correctly observed connectivities were wrongly tabelled (e.g. tabelling a daNconnectivity as a dNar connectivity results in an NOE distance restraint violation), or their intensities were estimated poorly. The RMD results appeared to function as a convincing indicator for this type of mistake made in assigning the NOESY spectrum of a protein the size of flavodoxin. There is evidently a need for automated 'bookkeeping' of assignments, automated peak integration procedures should be part of this. Assigning NMR spectra of a protein of this size by hand presumably represents the limits of what is feasible. A new RMD run was performed using the corrected NOE restraint list of 619 restraints, resulting in a considerable decrease of violations. After 40 ps of RMD only 20 distance restraints of the total number of 619 restraints were violated with more than 0.1 nm, including two serious violations of 0.46 and 0.48 nm (see Fig. 2). The serious violations involved NOEs connecting the amide resonance of I20 with the CctH and one C/IH resonance of E126. The NOEs between protons of amino acid residues in the immediate neighbourhood of I20 and El26 were consistent with the global fold of that part of the protein and did not show serious violations after the

The potential energy term Vdc is taken linear beyond r$ to avoid very strong restraining forces (which can easily lead to a distortion of the structure [44]). Here a value of ri'j = r$ 0.1 nm is used. The value of KdCwas changed during the refinement. We started with a relatively low value of 250 kJ mol-' nm-2 in order not to disrupt the global fold of the protein and to use the flexibility of the molecule for a proper search in conformational space. When the NOE restraints were no longer strongly violated, KdCwas gradually increased to a high value of 4000 kJ mol-' nm-2. Initial velocities of the atoms were taken from a Maxwellian distribution at 314 K. Translational and rotational motion of the flavodoxin were 'frozen'. During the RMD calculations the system was coupled to a thermal bath with a temperature of 314 K, the coupling constant was 0.1 ps [51]. The RMD time step was 1 fs; the list of non-bonded neighbouring atom pairs was updated every 10 fs; a cutoff radius of 0.8 nm was used beyond which no non-bonded interactions were evaluated. Solvent was not included in the calculations. The simulations were performed on a CONVEX-C1-XP and a VAX8650 computer using the GROMOS software package [47].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Generating the tertiary structure

The NOESY spectra of M . elsdenii flavodoxin contain an overwhelming amount of NOE connectivities. The majority of the protons has, besides the many intraresidual contacts, several interresidual NOE connectivities to other spin systems. About 4500 cross peaks are observed at the left-hand side of the water resonance in the 150-ms NOESY spectrum. The global fold (Fig. 9 in [16]) of M . elsdenii flavodoxin has been determined using non-sequential interresidual NOEs connecting protons far apart in the primary structure but in close proximity to each other as a result of the tertiary folding of the protein. The main secondary structural elements as determined by NMR have been positioned relative to each other using these long-range NOEs. These elements are (a) four regions of helicity; helix 1, N12-A26; helix 2, D64A75, helix 3, G94-El05 and helix 4, C127-Al35; (b) five /?-sheet strands: strand 1, V2-W7; strand 2, V31-F36; strand 3, V49-A56; strand 4, K82-Y89 and strand 5 , T110 -El 19 [16]. Fig. 1 illustrates several NOE connectivities determining the secondary structural elements and their relative spatial positions for a selected part of a NOESY spectrum.

KMD run. Thorough inspection of several 2D spectra resulted in the conclusion that the assignment of amino acid residues El26 and C127 should be interchanged, resulting in the loss of the two serious NOE violations. In fact the assignments of El26 and C127 by van Nierlo et al. [15] have been done this way. This illustrates the value of KMD as an aid in interpreting spectra. In the list for the final R M D run NOE restraints resulting from spin diffusion [41] were not incorporated. These restraints have been eliminated by checking a 50-ms NOESY spectrum. The large majority of the NOEs indicative for secondary structure were observed in the 150-ms, 100-ms as the well as in the 50-ms NOESY spectra. Spin-diffusive NOEs appeared to be homogeneously distributed among the amino acid residues of flavodoxin, as expected for a compact globular protein. It was noted that a 180 rotation of the peptide bond between P121 and D122, and between D122 and N123 would fit the NOE restraints better. As RMD appeared to be unable to perform this transition, we decided to d o this manually. Torsion angles of V44, I50 and V67 (xz), and of L85 (x3)were adjusted for the same reason. In the final distance restraint list one repulsive restraint (non-NOE) [42] has been included between N5H of the flavin and the amide proton o f E60, as clearly no NOE has been

observed between these protons in the 50-ms, 100-ms and 150-ms NOESY spectra (see Fig. 1, N5H=5.61 ppm, NH(60)= 9.39 ppm) 1151. We d o not expect that the absence of this NOE is a result of local mobility larger than that of the rest of the protein because the amide resonance of E60 has several manifest intra- and inter-residual NOE connectivities as is the case with the other amino acid residues, e.g. the amino acid residues which are part of the central P-sheet of the protein. The P-sheet region will be the most rigid part of the molecule as a consequence of packing restraints 1521. Clear intense NOE cross peaks between the flavin and the apoprotein have been observed 115, 161, consistent with the observation that the flavin is tightly bound to the apoprotein [9,12,53]. The protein-bound isoalloxazine ring and the phosphate d o not exhibit large fluctuations on the (sub)nanosecond timescale [9, 12, 531. Limited flexibility of the flavin on the picosecond time scale however cannot be excluded based on N M R results. It has been demonstrated for globular proteins that, when the structures are treated as rigid, the analysis of the structures of these proteins based on NOE measurements is meaningful 154-561. The decrease in NOE intensity as a result of picosecond motions is in general too small to produce a significant change in the distance dependence of the NOEs 1571.We therefore consider the non-NOE restraint as meaningful.

Each bar corresponds to the number of violations in a region indicated by the numbers on the horizontal axis. Each bar represents a 0.02-nm violation. The non-NOE between NH(E60) and N5H is violated by 0.011 nm in the average structure (60-120 ps; see text)

For the four as yet unassigned exchangeable side-chain protons observed in the two-dimensional homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn transfer spectra [58], but not in the NOESY spectra [15], we expect that the lack of NOEs is due to fast motions of these protons since they are part of flexible side chains at the surface of the protein. The final distance restraint list of 509 restraints comprised 293 sequential and medium-range distances and 216 longrange distances (amino acid residues at least four positions apart in the primary sequence [30]). Subsequently, an RMD run of 120 ps was done. During the first 50 ps the force constant was gradually increased to a high value of 4000 kJ mol-' nm-'. From 50 ps on, the potential energy and distance- restraint energy stabilizes to low values, and we decided to keep the force constant at this value. The time span of 60 120 ps, at a time resolution of 0.02 ps, was used for calculating time averages of various quantities and obtaining an average structure. This resulted in a structure of two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin that satisfies the experimental restraints very well (Figs 2 and 3). This time-averaged not energy-minimised structure has a low potential energy (-2278 f122 kJ mol- ') and essentially satisfies the experimental distance restraints (time-averaged sum of all violations is 2.27 nm, largest occurring violation is 66 pm). In the following we will refer to this as the averaged structure.

A pictorial representation of sequential and medium-range NOEs and the long-range NOEs is given in Fig. 4. There is a very good spreading of restraints over the molecule. The compactness of flavodoxin is reflected in a large number of long-range NOEs resulting in a high definition of the tertiary structure (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the number of restraints/amino

acid residue; only a few residues, all at the surface of the molecule, are unrestrained. Fig. 6 shows a superposition of seven structures of flavodoxin generated in the range 60 -

120 ps with a 10-ps time-interval, all satisfying the NOE restraints. As can be seen, the flexibility of the /?-strand is low. The helices of the protein exhibit higher positional flexibility, whereas turn and coil regions have the highest flexibility, as expected. However, the flexibility, even for the turn and coils, is still rather low. The average RMSD for an ensemble of structures with 5 ps time-spacing in the range 60 - 120 ps is 57 pm for the main-chain atoms and 85 pm for the side-chain atoms. Fig. 7 depicts the root-mean-square variations for main-chain and side-chain atoms in this ensemble. It should be noted that the RMD run has been performed in vucuo. Calculations in the presence of water are expected to result in smaller fluctuations. The relatively high main-chain fluctuations of W91 and N123 (respectively 0.14 and 0.11 nm) and side-chain fluctuations of R35, E61, E95, El19 and MI20 (respectively 0.18, 0.20, 0.21, 0.19 and 0.18 nm) will be the result of the in vucuo calculations, as all these residues are on the surface of the molecule. Fig. 8 depicts the Ramachandran (4, tp) plot [59] of the averaged structure of the flavodoxin molecule. The majority of the amino acid residues having unfavorable (4, tp) combinations are glycine residues which are known to have a greater freedom in dihedral angles. We can conclude that the obtained tertiary structure of two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin satisfies the NMR restraints very well. The structure will be further analyzed in the following sections.

Discussion of the tertiary structure Secondary structure elements and exchange characteristics The secondary structure of the averaged protein structure (Fig. 3) has been analyzed using the criteria of Kabsch and Sander [60]. Secondary structure elements are recognized by their specifichydrogen bonding patterns. The secondary structure is summarized in Table 1. In addition to this, the computed water accessibility of amino acid residues has been indicated, as well as the individual amide exchange rates against 2 H z 0 determined via a 2D-NMR exchange experiment [15, 161. Amides with slow exchange rates were present during the 'H20 exchange NOESY experiment which lasted 19.4 h (pH 8.3, 41 "C). Amide protons with fast exchange rates had no detectable resonance intensity in the exchange experiment [15, 161. M . elsdenii flavodoxin is clearly a parallel a/B protein [61]. Five regions of helicity are recognized: N12 A26, V41 -A45, D64-L74, E95-Dl06 and E126-Al35, and five regions showing 0-sheet characteristics: V2 - Y6, V31 -R35, V49-G53, K82-Y89 and T110-N118. The small a-helix from V41 to A45 has been predicted [16]. The 0sheet strand 3 extends from residue V49 to A56 as judged from dorN connectivities, and from V49 to G53 based on hydrogenbonding patterns [60]; this is the result of P55 disturbing the hydrogen-bonding pattern. The water accessibility of amino acid residues which are part of the internal 0-sheet strands of the flavodoxin molecule is low; many of them are even inaccessible to water molecules (Table 1). This property, combined with hydrogen bonding of the corresponding amide protons, results in the strong persistence of these amides against 2 H z 0exchange at pH 8.3 and 41 "C [15,16]. Every second amide proton of the peripheral strands of the &sheet (V31 -R35 and TllO-Nl18) is not hydrogen-bonded, and will exchange relatively rapidly with the solvent [38]. This is indeed observed for strand T110N118, although it exhibits an irregularity in the exchange pattern that is consistent with a 0-bulge (Fig. 9). Only one amide proton of the other peripheral strand V31- R35 shows slow exchange with the deuterated solvent. This strand is particularly accessible to solvent molecules. In some cases hydrogen bonding between residues in the calculated structure may result from simulations in the absence of solvent. This could be the case for the hydrogen bond observed between NH(116) and an OEatom of E126; Fig. 9 shows the hydrogen bond starting at NH(116), the 0, atoms of El26 have not been depicted.

is exchanging relatively rapidly with deuterium oxide. Both groups are on the surface of the molecule and accessible to solvent molecules. When water is included in the calculations, it is very likely that both groups will be found to be stabilized by hydrogen bonding to solvent molecules. Residues which are part of helices appear to be more accessible to solvent than residues which are part of the 8sheet of the protein. This is in agreement with expectation because the a-helices do not form the core of the molecule but surround it. The majority of the amide protons, which are not part of a-helices or 0-sheet strands, exhibit fast exchange with deuterium oxide (Table 1). Such amide protons take part in turns and bends which are less stabilized by hydrogen bonding, and are normally flexible and highly solvent-accessible, as they occur most frequently at the surface of proteins [61], as is also the case for M . elsdenii flavodoxin (Fig. 3). (When an amino acid residue has no calculated solvent accessibility for the averaged structure but its corresponding amide proton does exchange, e.g. T13 in Table 1, this must result from flexibility of the molecule.) It can be concluded that the

tertiary structure of M . elsdenii flavodoxin as presented in this paper is consistent with the amide exchange characteristics. The high structural similarity between flavodoxin from Clostridium M P and M . elsdeenii has been visualized in Fig. 10. A striking difference is observed in the position of the phosphate moiety of FMN (Fig. 11). Investigation of `snap shot' structures from the 60 - 120-ps interval showed torsional fluctuations around the CS' - 0 5 ' axis, as well as flipping motions of the benzene part of the isoalloxazine. The F M N binding rcgion Amino acid residues W7 -T13, GS3 -E63, G87-A99 and I1 16 - E l 19 form the flavin binding site of flavodoxin, as judged from disappearance or broadening of the corresponding proton resonances in a solution of flavodoxin molecules in the semiquinone state [IS, 161. The amino acid residues A56- E61 and Y89 - G92 are in the immediate neighbour-

hood of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin molecule. This is in agreement with the observation of the instantaneous disappearance of the corresponding proton resonances in a solution of reduced flavodoxin containing a small amount semiquinone, the result of a fast electron transfer between the flavodoxin molecules [ 11, 151. The phosphate group and CS'H, C4'H, C4'OH, C3'H and C3'OH do not have NOE restraints, whereas CI'H, C2'OH, C6H, CH3(7a) and C9H of the flavin do have them. The phosphate group shows strong positional fluctuation during the molecular dynamics simulation (1 18-pm RMSD fluctuation). Positions differ as much as 0.4 nm. We do not believe that such a high flexibility is realistic, but is a computational artefact resulting from two effects. Firstly, the phosphate is bound in the dianionic form [9]. The negatively charged phosphate is expected, in analogy to Clostridium M P flavodoxin, to be strongly hydrogen-bonded to the loop S8-TI 3. The phosphate is necessary for a strong binding of FMN to the apoprotein of M . elsdenii (K,= 1.1 x lo8 M-' in the reduced state) and Clostridium M P flavodoxin, riboflavin does not bind to a detectable extent (K, < lo3 M-') [l]. The hydrogen-bonding capacity of the loop region can be observed in Fig. 12. However, in the RMD calculations the two negative charges on the phosphate could not properly be taken into account.

Secondly, water plays an important role in regions of the molecule accessible to solvent molecules and having a charge. The phosphate-binding region is accessible to solvent molecules as observed in an amide exchange experiment (Table 1). The hydrogen bond between NH(10) and Os(12), observed in the RMD run, might be the result of the absence of water molecules. Based on the high structural similarity between M . elsdenii and Clostridium M P flavodoxin, we expect the phosphate-binding regions to be virtually identical. This implies, for the M . elsdenii protein, hydrogen bonds from the phosphate to the amides of G9, T10, N12 and T13 and to S O H , TlOOH and T130H. The amide protons of G9, T10, N12 and T13 resonate at very low field, at 10.43, 9.35, 11.49 and 11.40 ppm respectively [15]. This is consistent with a low electron density on these protons as a result of strong hydro-

gen bonding to the negatively charged phosphate. The amides of T10, N12 and T13 are at least 0.5 nm away from the indole part of W7 which is the aromatic amino acid residue in closest proximity to the phosphate binding region. This suggests that the vicinity of the phosphate is the major cause for the anomalous chemical shifts. The resonance position of the amide of G9 might be influenced by the indole part of W7 which is in proximity. Quiocho et al. [62] proposed, based on detailed investigations of a few crystal structures of proteins, that isolated charges can be stabilized by peptide dipoles in the interior of a protein. Our NMR results suggest that the phosphate group is `solvated' by the local dipolar components of the apoprotein. Local polarity of the protein is expected to play an important role in the stabilization of ionic groups [63]. The study on flavodoxin is to our knowledge the first support

194 magnet at 41 "C). This explains the constant linewidth of the phosphorus resonance after redissolving the flavodoxin in water, as every deuteron has already been replaced by a proton before the first NMR scan had been acquired by Moonen and Muller [9]. The solvent accessibility of the phosphate as determined by NMR demonstrates the need for additional RMD calculations of the three-dimensional structure of M . elsdenii flavodoxin in the presence of water. C2'OH of the ribityl side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of A56 and C3'OH with OGof E119. The latter hydrogen bond is not expected, as the resonance of C3'OH is absent in the 2D-NMR spectra caused by too rapid exchange with the solvent [15]. In Clostridium M P and D. vulgaris flavodoxin, the C3'OH is accessible to the solvent as deduced from X-ray [2-51 and 31P-NMR data [64] on the native protein and those reconstituted with riboflavin 3',5'-bisphosphate. The hydrogen bond observed for M . elsdenii flavodoxin is therefore expected to be an artefact resulting from calculation without water. C4'OH also has a hydrogen bond to an OE atom of El19 in the averaged structure (60120 ps). This hydrogen bond is real and is reflected by the observation of C4'OH by NMR despite its position on the periphery of the molecule. In Fig. 12 the hydrogen bonding of the isoalloxazine moiety with the apoprotein is depicted, the situation is very similar to Clostridium M P flavodoxin [3]. Distances between the hydrogen-bonding partners as determined for Clostridium M P flavodoxin [3] and M . elsdenii flavodoxin are given in Table 2. Differences between both proteins are observed in the distances between N1 and 0 2 of the flavin and the neighbouring amides. In the two-electron reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin (having a negative charge on N1 [12]) the NOE restraints lead to a structure that is more compact around N1 and 0 2 than in one-electron-reduced Clostridium M P flavodoxin. It is not yet clear whether this is a consequence of introducing a negative charge on N1 (reflected in the NOE restraints) as compared to the one-electron-reduced state of Clostridium M P flavodoxin, or whether this results from omitting water molecules from the calculations. Part of the isoalloxazine-binding region is accessible to solvent molecules, evidenced by the computed solvent accessibility of many of the constituting residues and by the exchange characteristics of the amide protons in this region in a NOESY exchange experiment at 41 T,pH 8.3 (Table 1). The majority of the amide protons in this region shows a rapid exchange with the deuterated solvent. The amino acid residues P55, A56 and S88 are, however, inaccessible to solvent molecules. The accessibility does not imply that exchangeable protons of flavodoxin do exchange rapidly with solvent on the NMR time scale. Such a rapid exchange would result in saturation transfer from the irradiated water to these exchangeable protons, as observed for the amide protons of V41, D48, G80, N118, D122 and El26 of two-electron-reduced flavodoxin 1151. All other exchangeable protons are detected in an NMR experiment with water as solvent [I 51, implying that these protons do not rapidly exchange within a time span of a few seconds. This is also consistent with previous 15N-NMR results showing that N3H and N5H of the flavin do exchange slowly on the NMR time scale [12], and with the indifference of the 5'-phosphate group on addition of Mn2+to the solvent [64], as M n Z +will not come in close contact with the phosphate group on the time scale of seconds. The possibility of measuring exchange characteristics of individual protons by NMR signifies important additional information on protein tertiary structure. In the crystallographic study on one-elec-

The region includes S8-Tl3, ,456-E61 and Y89-G92. Hydrogen bonds (existing at least 30% of the time in the trajectory 60- 120 ps) are shown by dashed lines connecting the donor and acceptor. Amides have been labeled of such stabilizing peptide dipoles based on experimentally determined chemical shifts of amide protons and not based solely on distance information [62]. The amide proton of G11 is not expected to form a hydrogen bond to the phosphate. This is reflected in its chemical shift of 7.55 ppm [I 51. Observation of the exchangeable protons %OH, TI 30H and NH&(12)in the loop-like phosphatebinding region at a relatively high pH of 8.3 and 41 "C [15] is strongly indicative for strong hydrogen bonding of these protons (as in the crystal structure of Clostridium M P flavodoxin [2-41). The hydroxyl functions of S8 and TI3 both resonate downfield-shifted from their expected resonance positions. The hydroxyl group of TI0 does not form a strong hydrogen bond to the phosphate group as its resonance has not been observed. Despite the hydrogen bonding to the phosphate, the amides of G9, T10, N12 and T13 exhibit fast exchange with the deuterated solvent on the time scale of a two-dimensional NOESY exchange experiment (Table 1); the amino acid residues are clearly solvent-accessible. This is in contradiction with the results of Moonen and Muller [9] who showed that `the phosphate group is deeply buried in the apoenzyme and inaccessible to the solvent'. They based their conclusions on the pH-independence of the 31P chemical shift in the pH range 6.0 - 9.2 of the flavodoxin solution, and on the constant linewidth of the phosphorus resonance on redissolving the flavodoxin in water after it had been dissolved in deuterium oxide (at pH 8.2, 26'C [9]). In the 2D `H-NMR spectra, the chemical shifts of the amide protons involved in phosphate binding of M . elsdenii flavodoxin appear to be almost independent (0.1-ppm variation) of the pH in the region 7.0-8.3 in samples containing varying percentages of semiquinone/ hydroquinone. This is in agreement with, and complementary to, the results of Moonen and Muller [9]. The hydrogen bonding to the phosphate group overshadows the pH effect, as is also the case for the phosphorus resonance. The amide protons, hydrogen bonding to the phosphate, exchange relatively rapidly with the deuterated solvent. In the first scan of a two-dimensional NOESY exchange experiment they are already exchanged (the sample was kept on ice while the protein was dissolved in deuterium oxide, the first scan was taken approximately 30 min after the sample was put into the

tron-reduced Clostridium M P flavodoxin one water molecule has been observed in the immediate vicinity of the isoalloxazine moiety and three water molecules in the vicinity of the ribityl side chain. Contact of the isoalloxazine moiety with the solvent was regarded as severely restricted [3], the benzene part of the isoalloxazine appeared solvent-accessible. Moonen et al. [65] proposed electrostatic interactions as the main factor determining the redox potential for the semiquinone/hydroquinone transition in flavodoxins. Entropy changes between one- and two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin will not contribute significantly to the free energy change, hence to its redox potential, because there is no large conformational difference between the two redox states as judged by kinetic exchange experiments [ll]. The electrostatic interaction energy between the negative charge on the N1 of the protein-bound two-electron-reduced FMN and the two negative charges on the phosphate group of FMN, separated by a distance of approximately 0.8 nm, were postulated to represent the dominant contribution to the corresponding redox potential of the flavodoxins, assuming a relative dielectric constant of 20 1651. Also the monopole/ monopole interaction between N1 and the negative charges of the protein, and the monopole/dipole interaction between N1 and the dipole moment of the protein were considered to contribute to the redox potential, but both to a lesser extent than the N1 /phosphate interaction. The phosphate group and the isoalloxazine ring were considered to be tightly bound and buried in the protein. The present study indicates, however, that the phosphate-binding region and part of the isoalloxazine binding region are accessible to the solvent. Recent insights in the importance of electrostatic interactions in proteins [63, 66-68] show that charges can be effectively stabilized, especially in solvent-accessible regions of the protein, resulting in large effective dielectric constants in these regions ( E , between 30 and 60 in most cases [63]), thus rendering long-range electrostatic interactions less determining. Based on charge stabilization and solvent accessibility,it could be imagined that the role of the negatively charged phosphate group on the redox potential of the flavodoxin will be less dominant than proposed [65]. Short-range electrostatic interactions ( R < 0.4 nm) caused by local polarities were reported to be very important, e.g. in the case of the control of the redox potential of cytochrome c (103 amino acid residues) as compared to a reference octapeptide system with a methionine-histidine-ligated heme, having the same heme-ligand complex as cytochrome c [67]. The difference in redox poten-

tial between these systems is about 300 mV. In this study, interactions between the heme charges and the protein permanent dipoles (e.g, the N-H and c = 0 dipoles of the peptide bonds), the protein-induced dipoles and the water molecules were calculated as were the monopole/monopole interactions between charges. The polarization of water molecules around cytochrome c appeared to compensate largely for the electrostatic interactions between the charge center of the oxidized heme and the propionate 0-,being at a distance of 0.8 nm of the heme center. This corresponds to a large dielectric constant. The major contribution to the redox potential of cytochrome c as compared to the octapeptide appeared to be the destabilization of the heme charge in the oxidized state (relative to its energy in water) by its local microenvironment as compared to the reduced heme. The microenvironment can be considered as a medium of low dielectric constant [67]. For M . elsdenii flavodoxin we are dealing with a comparable situation: a charged N1 of the isoalloxazine ring in case of two-electron reduction and an uncharged N1 in case of oneelectron reduction. The electrostatic interaction between the charge on N1 and the phosphate is expected to be, as for cytochrome c, largely compensated as a result of polarization of water molecules present in the immediate neighbourhood of both groups. The NMR results concerning the water accessibility of amino acid residues in the flavin-binding region will be essential in understanding the redox properties of this protein. We think, related to the situation described for cytochrome c, that the charged N1 is destabilized by its nonpolar microenvironment in which no charged group is present within a distance of 0.6 nm of the N1 as is deduced from the tertiary structure, as compared to the uncharged situation (both relative to their energies in water) resulting in a major contribution to the redox potential. The presence ofwater molecules in the vicinity of the isoalloxazine moiety, as evidenced by the amide exchange characteristics, does not imply that a water molecule is present at the N1 position, no space is present at that position for such a molecule as is also the case for Clostridium M P flavodoxin [69]. Such a water molecule would result in protonation of the N1, which is not observed in M . elsdenii flavodoxin [12]. The electrostatically destabilized (relative to water), negatively charged N1 is expected to be crucial in the explanation of the redox potential of this flavodoxin. A calculation of the overall free energy change associated with the change in N1 charge on going from the semiquinone to the hydroquinone state, in which the electrostatic solvent effects are properly taken into account, will reveal the roles of the various electrostatic interactions in determining the redox potential. To gain more insight into the role water is expected to play in the flavin-binding region of flavodoxin, additional simulations taking water molecules into account will be performed. Such calculations are expected to result in a tertiary structure slightly different from the one presented here, but nevertheless important in view of the function of flavodoxin. For example the distance between the amides of E60 and E61, which are both close to the isoalloxazine, is 0.3 m in the structure presented here (the corresponding amides are separated by 0.29 nm in the crystal structure of Clastridium M P flavodoxin). N o dNN contact between the two amino acid residues is observed however.

The polar parts, involved in thc salt bridge are solvent-accessible

have a closer view at some features of this molecule, notably typical N H chemical shifts. Amide backbone protons exhibiting a chemical shift that exceeds 9.50 ppm are expected to reflect specific properties of the flavodoxin molecule; these include the amides of G9, N12, T13, V34, E37, L51, V66, F71, (390, G92, S93, W96, N123 and El26 [15]. The large majority of the amide proton resonances of proteins reported so far have chemical shifts below 9.5 ppm [70]. The typical chemical shifts of G9, N12 and T13 are expected to result from the strong hydrogen bonding to the dianionic phosphate of the FMN molecule as already described. The amide protons of G90, G92 and S93 are in the plane of the flavin molecule, their down-field shifts result from ring currents in the aromatic part of the prosthetic group. The amide proton resonances of V34, E37, V66, F71 and W96 are shifted down-field, probably as a result of local magnetic fields caused by aromatic groups in the immediate vicinity of these protons. There are no aromatic groups in the immediate vicinity of the amide protons of L51, N123 and Ei26, nor are these protons hydrogen bonded significantly more strongly than the other amide protons. At present we have no explanation for the extreme resonance positions of these amide resonances (9.65, 10.49 and 10.32 ppm, respectively [15]). i n the immediate neighbourhood of N123 and El26 are proline residues, PI21 and P125, respectively, which are known as `structure breakers'; this might exert an effect on the chemical shift of these amides [71]. Another typical property of two-electron-reduced flavodoxin is the unusual line shape of several cross peaks in the two-dimensional NMR spectra (Fig. 1, cross peaks labeled 3, 3/2, 413, 2/31, 31/32, 4/33, 3213, 51/50, 112/111; the residues concerned are all part of the central parallel /%sheet of flavodoxin). The wing-shaped line shape is also observed for these cross peaks in the two-dimensional amide exchange experiment against deuterons as they do not disappear [16]. The wing shape is enhanced when the temperature of the sample is increased (unpublished observation). The resonances of amino acid residues V2, E3,14, E32, L51, K82, G84 and I112 exhibit these lineshapes. The effect is strongest for the NOESY cross peaks involving the amide resonances of V2, E3, I4 and E32 (see Fig. 1 ) . The extraordinary line shape immediately disappears on slight oxidation of the two-electron-reduced flavodoxin sample, normal line shapes are then observed (Figs 7 and 8 in [ 151). We have demonstrated, using NOESY difference spectra [I 51, that a decrease in pH of approximately 0.5 occurs on slight oxidation of a completely reduced flavodoxin sample. On the basis of the local structure around V2, E3, I4 and E32 (Fig 13), we now tentatively explain these typical line shapes as a result of instability of a salt bridge

between the polar groups of the side chains of E3, E32, D43 and K47. The majority of the flavodoxin molecules have a salt bridge in this region of the protein, these molecules are characterized by a normal symmetric line shape at the central position of the corresponding cross peaks. As a consequence of the high pH (pH = 8.3) and temperature (41 "C), this salt bridge is no longer present in a fraction of the molecules. We think that a small structural rearrangement of the side chains is responsible for the existence of two slightly different structures, with slightly different resonance positions. These two structures do not interconvert on the NMR timescale but can both return to the original salt bridge conformation with an intermediate exchange rate on the NMR time scale. Both structures exhibit the same decreased resonance position of the corresponding backbone amide resonances and different aliphatic resonance positions resulting in the typical line shape as observed in Fig. 1. On slight oxidation of the sample, the pH drops immediately; the salt bridge is then stabilized and all flavodoxin molecules have the same conformation again, evidenced by the normal line shape then observed. It is remarkable that the disrupture of this salt bridge not only results in a local rearrangement of amino acid residues, but that its influence is extended over a large part of the central p-sheet structure (e.g. the amide resonance of 1112, roughly 2 nm away from the salt bridge, exhibits the same typical line shape) of the flavodoxin molecule. This is a good illustration of the influence of dynamic phenomena on line shape; it is, to our knowledge, the first time such local rearrangements have been observed within proteins by using NMR. There are no indications for any change in the structure of the flavin-binding region.

Concluding remarks A tertiary structure of two-electron-reduced M . elsdenii flavodoxin has been determined that satisfies the NOE restraints very well (66 pm maximum NOE violation). The definition of the structure of the apoprotein is high. FMN was found to be very flexible. We expect this to be an artefact of calculations without solvent, and without proper charges on the phosphate and N1 position. The flavin-binding region, being the interesting part of the molecule, is largely solventaccessible as determined by a two-dimensional NOESY exchange experiment (this does not imply rapid amide proton exchange on the NMR time scale). We expect the presence of water in the neighbourhood of the flavin to be important in the redox potential regulation of the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple of flavodoxin. Besides satisfying the NOE restraints, the structure of M . elsdenii flavodoxin obtained is largely

197
consistent with other NMR parameters such as amide exchange characteristics. Based on the high structural similarity between M . elsdenii and Clostridium M P flavodoxin, we think that water plays virtually the same role in both proteins. Using the structural information gathered, it is now possible to have a closer view at M . elsdenii flavodoxin in the oxidized state, as will be presented in the near future. The still remaining unassigned NOE cross peaks for the two-electron-reduced state of the protein can be assigned using the detailed tertiary structure as presented in this paper and these can then be used as additional NOE restraints for refining the tertiary structure of this protein. In addition to this, it will be possible to make a number of stereospecific assignments by comparing distances in the structure obtained with intensities; this leads to a better definition of the structure [38]. Molecular dynamics simulations of the structure of M . elsdenii flavodoxin taking the solvent into account are planned and will be required for more accurate results. The NOE restraint list is available on request.
