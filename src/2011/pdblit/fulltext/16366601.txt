The synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies of novel indole derivatives as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists are reported. Indole, a druglike scaffold, was studied as a core skeleton for the acidic head part of PPAR agonists. The structural features (acidic head, substitution on indole, and linker) were optimized first, by keeping benzisoxazole as the tail part, based on binding and functional activity at PPAR protein. The variations in the tail part, by introducing various heteroaromatic ring systems, were then studied. In vitro evaluation led to identification of a novel series of indole compounds with a benzisoxazole tail as potent PPAR agonists with the lead compound 14 (BPR1H036) displaying an excellent pharmacokinetic profile in BALB/c mice and an efficacious glucose lowering activity in KKAy mice. Structural biology studies of 14 showed that the indole ring contributes strong hydrophobic interactions with PPAR and could be an important moiety for the binding to the protein.
Introduction Type 2 diabetes, a chronic disease characterized by the failure to respond to insulin, has assumed epidemic proportions, according to the WHO.1 Currently more than 194 million people suffer from diabetes worldwide. The number is expected to exceed 333 million by 2025.2 The single most important contributor to the pathogenesis of diabetes is obesity, which is increasing at a staggering pace with changing lifestyles and food habits.3 Most of the current therapies for type 2 diabetes were developed in the absence of defined molecular targets or an understanding of the disease pathogenesis and have a number of adverse effects, compromising the quality of life of the patients. But the emerging knowledge of the key pathogenic mechanisms has led to identification of a number of molecular drug targets during the last decade.3 Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPAR), consisting of three subtypes with distinct genes, PPARR, PPAR, and PPAR, are members of the nuclear receptor family.4 PPAR agonists (Figure 1) offer a promising approach to type 2 diabetes and the associated metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. PPAR agonists, 1 (rosiglitazone) and 2 (pioglitazone), were launched in 1999 and registered increases in sales by 73.2% and

Figure 2. Design of indole-based PPAR agonists.

PPARR/ dual agonists, such as 3-6, have been reported in this class of compounds9-11 and have shown robust insulin-sensitizing and hypolipidemic activities in clinical trials. The new drug application for muraglitazar (Bristol-Meyers Squibb/Merck) was filed with the US FDA in December 2004.12,13 PPAR initially received the least attention of the three isoforms of PPAR nuclear receptors because of its ubiquitous expression and the unavailability of selective ligands. However, recently reported synthetic PPAR agonists, such as 7, have helped to reveal its role as a powerful regulator of fatty acid catabolism and energy homeostasis, retarding weight gain and improving insulin resistance, thus demonstrating their potential therapeutic value in diabetes and obesity.14 Some PPAR pan-agonist compounds with potential antihyperglycemic, lipid-modulating, and insulin-sensitizing activity have been reported recently15-17 and have evoked much interest with their evolving pharmacology. A PPAR pan-agonist GW677954 from GlaxoSmithKline is currently in Phase II clinical trials for type 2 diabetes,18 while Plexxikon has completed the preclinical studies for its pan-agonist, PLX204 and plans to start clinical studies in 2005.19 Keeping in view the potential of PPAR agonist compounds as treatment for clinical conditions in metabolic disorders, we report the design, synthesis, structure-activity relationships (SAR), X-ray crystallographic studies, and biological studies of novel, highly potent indole-based PPAR agonists. A typical PPAR agonist usually has an acidic head attached to an aromatic scaffold, a linker, and a hetero-aromatic hydrophobic tail (Figure 2). Following a similar model, we designed novel indole-based PPAR agonists optimizing each essential part, acidic head, linker, and hydrophobic tail. Some indole 5-acetic acids with potent PPAR agonist activity and high selectivity have been reported earlier.20,21 We decided to use indole as a core skeleton for the acidic head, placing the acidic head at the N1-position, in place of the tyrosine-based acidic heads used in many of the reported PPAR agonists, and placing the tail part on the aromatic ring of indole attached through a linker. Indole, besides being a

versatile drug-like scaffold, provided a simple synthetic pathway to the desired compounds starting from commercially available hydroxyindoles. The 7-propyl-3-trifluoromethylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol has been reported as a potent building block for hydrophobic tail in the literature.16 We incorporated it as the tail part to study whether hydroxyindole with an acidic head at N1-position could be a replacement for the tyrosine-based scaffolds and to establish the initial structure-activity relationships to optimize the linker, substitution on the indole scaffold, and the acidic head. A series of compounds (11-27, Table 1) were synthesized with the 7-propyl-3-trifluoromethylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol as a building block for the hydrophobic tail following the general synthetic scheme (Scheme 1). Once the head and linker were optimized, compounds 28-35 (Table 2) with different hydrophobic tail parts were synthesized (Scheme 3) to optimize the tail part and to study the effect on the activity and selectivity of various heteroaromatic five,six-membered fused ring systems, such as benzisoxazole, indole, and benzofuran. The heteroaromatic building blocks were selected from either PPAR agonists reported in the literature or some newly synthesized indole and benzofuran-based compounds. The preliminary structure-activity relationships were studied on the basis of binding and functional assays for the human PPAR protein. The potent compounds (Table 3) were evaluated for selectivity by determining hPPARR and hPPAR functional activity. Based on the results from the binding and functional assays, compound 14 was selected for detailed biochemical, in vivo, pharmacokinetic, and structural biology studies. Results and Discussion Chemistry. The desired compounds with a 7-propyl3-trifluoromethylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol tail (11-27, Table 1) were synthesized starting from the commercially available hydroxyindoles 8 as shown in general synthetic Scheme 1. The hydroxyindole was alkylated with an appropriate bromochloroalkane in the presence of an equimolar amount of potassium hydroxide in DMSO or

potassium carbonate in 2-butanone, yielding 9a-9l. Compounds 9a-9l were coupled with the 7-propyl-3trifluoromethylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol, which was prepared by using a modification of the Adams et al. procedure,22 to give 10a-10l. The esters 11a-24a were obtained by refluxing the appropriate compound from 10a-10l with methyl-2-bromoalkylate in the presence of potassium carbonate and potassium iodide in acetonitrile. The esters 25a and 26a were prepared by stirring the mixture of 10c and 10d, respectively, with ethyl acrylate and potassium carbonate in acetonitrile

at room temperature. Finally, compounds 11a-26a were deprotected with lithium hydroxide in a methanolwater mixture to afford 11-26. The tetrazole 27 was synthesized from 10d in two steps as shown in Scheme 2. Compounds 28-35 (Table 2) with various heteroaromatic building blocks replacing 3-trifluoromethylbenzisoxazole as the tail part were synthesized as depicted in Scheme 3. SAR Studies. The aim of the present study was to identify novel potent indole-based PPAR agonists with better profiles as possible drug candidates for type 2 diabetes. The synthesized compounds 11-35 were evaluated for the in vitro binding and transactivation at hPPAR protein (Tables 1 and 2) to identify the optimum characteristics of the compounds for PPAR agonist activity. The benzisoxazole analogues 11-27 (Table 1) displayed varying degrees of binding and transactivational activities thus establishing the viability of indole as a core skeleton for the acidic head. This set of compounds also elucidated the SAR for the acidic head and linker. The 5-substituted indole analogue 14 with an n-propyl linker showed more potent binding and functional activity as compared to the 4- and 6-substituted analogues 13 and 15, indicating that the 5-position of indole was most appropriate for the attachment to the linker with both 4-position and 6-position analogues showing weak activity. This variation in activity may be due to the most appropriate orientation provided by the 5-substituted indoles in binding with protein. Compounds 14 and 17, with n-propyl and n-butyl linkers, respectively, attached to the 5-position of indole, exhibited potent binding as well as functional activities. The change in linker to ethyl as in compound 12 decreased the potency by 2-fold, while an n-pentyl linker (19) substantially decreased the activity. These results showed that an

n-propyl or n-butyl linker was most appropriate, while an ethyl linker slightly decreased the activity; any

further increase in linker length was detrimental to activity. The 4-substituted indole analogues with ethyl, n-butyl, and n-pentyl linkers (11, 16, and 18, respectively) were also evaluated to see whether change in linker length could compensate for change in position on indole. All three compounds, 11, 16, and 18, were less potent than their 5-position analogues, 12, 17, and 19, respectively; but 16 with an n-butyl linker was more potent than 13 with an n-propyl linker, thus indicating that increase in linker length to n-butyl might restore some activity in case of 4-substituted indoles. Introduction of methyl substitution on the linker (20-22) led to further decrease in activity. The increase in distance of carboxylic acid from the indole nitrogen (23, 24) also resulted in decreased

activity. Similarly, introduction of an ethyl substitution on the acidic head (25, 26) resulted in decrease in activity. The bioisosteric replacement of the carboxylic acid with tetrazole (27) resulted in 4-fold decrease in binding activity, thus indicating that the acetic acid was the most appropriate acidic head and increase in bulk might decrease the activity. Compounds without an acidic head (10c, 10d) were inactive both in binding and in functional assays, thus indicating that the acidic head was essential for activity. To summarize, the n-propyl or n-butyl linker, 5-substituted indole, and acetic acid head were most appropriate for potent PPAR binding and functional activity. Compound 14 with an n-propyl linker substituted on the 5-position of indole and an acetic acid head showed the most potent binding and functional activities at PPAR. Next, we decided to replace the 7-propyl-3-trifluoromethylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol with various building blocks to study the effect of various heteraromatic five,six-membered fused ring systems as the tail part (Table 2). The 3-phenyl-7-propyl-benzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol17 and 3-phenyl-7-propylbenzofuran,16 with reported potential contributions to PPAR agonist activity, were selected from the literature. Some new indole- and benzofuran-based building blocks were synthesized to study the effect of substitution of groups such as hydrogen, cyano, COCF3, and phenyl at the 3-position. The hydroxyl and propyl groups were retained at the 6- and 7-positions, respectively, in all the newly synthesized building blocks to mimic the 7-propyl-3-trifluoromethylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol. These heteroaromatic systems also gave the flexibility to move the phenyl group to the 2-position. Compounds 28 and 29 with a 7-propyl-3-phenylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol tail showed potent activity in binding and functional assays with a 5-substituted indole, 29, being slightly more potent than a 4-substituted one, 28. The 3-phenyl substituted 28 was much more potent as compared to 3-trifluoromethyl substituted 13, though a similar difference in potency was not seen in case of the corresponding 5-indole substituted analogues 29 and 14. All other analogues (30-35) with the indole- and benzofuran-based tails showed substantial decreases in the functional activities. The 3-cyanoindole analogue exhibited submicromolar PPAR binding activity but a weak functional activity in a cell-based transactivation assay. The benzisoxazole-based tails were the most suitable building blocks in the present study with the 3-trifluoromethyl (14) and 3-phenyl (28, 29) substituted compounds, showing potent binding and transfection activities at all three subtypes. The structure-activity relationships are summarized in Figure 3. Compounds with potent PPAR functional activity and different tail groups were evaluated for PPARR and PPAR functional activities to determine the selectivity (Table 3). The benzisoxazole analogues 14, 28, and 29 displayed potent activities at all three PPAR subtypes. The n-butyl linker analogue of 14, 17, showed potent PPAR and PPAR activities but a 70-fold decrease in PPARR activity. Compound 13 with the benzisoxazole tail attached to the 4-position of the indole through an n-propyl linker exhibited dual PPARR/ activity. Compound 30 with the 7-propylindole as tail showed selectivity for PPAR as compared to PPARR and PPAR.

Compounds 33 and 34 showed selective PPARR agonist activity. The results indicated that variation in the linker length, the position on indole, and the tail building block affects the selectivity toward the PPAR subtypes. The benzisoxazole building block, 5-substituted indole, and n-propyl linker favors potent PPAR activity. Compound 14 with all these features exhibited PPAR transactivation activity similar to that of rosiglitazone. It also displayed potent functional activities for PPARR and PPAR. Based on the in vitro functional activities, it was selected for further biochemical, in vivo, pharmacokinetic, and structural biology studies. Biological Studies. Compound 14 showed 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (Figure 4) and aP2 gene induction (Figure 5) similar to those of the rosiglitazone. It also exhibited strong insulin sensitizer activity in a 2-deoxyglucose uptake assay (Figure 6). The overall in

vitro profile of 14 indicated that it could be a very promising antidiabetic candidate. Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the male BALB/c mice with the sodium salt of 14 indicated that it had 100% oral bioavailability and excellent pharmacokinetic parameters with a large AUC, low clearance, and reasonably long half-life (Table 4). In the obese, insulin-resistant KKAy mice with elevated plasma glucose levels, 10 days of treatment with the sodium salt of 14 showed a significant reduction in plasma glucose levels at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg dose levels (Figure 7). The glucose levels returned to the pretreatment levels after the treatment was stopped. Cocrystallization with hPPAR. To further understand the interaction with the hPPAR receptor, crystals of the hPPAR ligand-binding domain (LBD) in a complex with 14 were prepared by cocrystallization. The cocrystal structure was solved to a resolution of 2.28 Å. The asymmetric unit contained two monomers, monomer A and monomer B. The electron density maps of the PPAR LBD were clear, except for some disordered regions, including residues 264-273 in both monomers and the residues 468-477 in monomer B. The loop of residues 264-273 was located at the

entrance of the ligand-binding site and was highly flexible in all published structures. Its flexibility could allow access of a large ligand, such as 14, to the binding pocket of PPAR. The electron density map of 14 bound in the binding site was very clear, and the model of the compound fitted well into the density map. It was found that two molecules of 14 bound to the two monomers (one to each) unlike other reported complex structures,23,24 where only one molecule bound to the homodimer (one monomer contained the molecule, and the other monomer was unoccupied). The overall structure of the PPAR-14 complex was very similar to the published PPAR apo and complex structures, except for differences in some flexible loops, including residues 264-273. When the binding site of the PPAR-14 complex structure was compared to the published structures, the most significant movement was the shift of the residues 364 and 363 (Figure 8). The residue Met364 moved away from the active site upon ligand binding to accommodate the linker group of 14. This movement consequently resulted in the shift of its adjacent residue, Phe363. In addition, residues 282, 286, and 289 also slightly shifted to enable better interaction with the ligand. Protein-Ligand Interaction. Compound 14 bound to each monomer and adopted a very similar conformation in both, except for a minor rotation of its carboxylic acid head. The structure of monomer A in complex with 14 is presented to discuss the interaction between PPAR and 14 (Figure 9). The carboxylic acid head of 14 formed hydrogen bonds with Tyr473, His449, His323, and Ser289, where Tyr473 was located in the AF-2 helix. This hydrogen bonding pattern is conserved in most PPAR-agonist complex structures and is essential for the activity of the ligand. The indole ring of 14 was perpendicular to His449 and formed a hydrophobic interaction with it. This hydrophobic interaction was a unique feature in the PPAR14 structures, because other reported complex structures had only a hydrogen bonding interaction with

Structural Comparison of 14, 1 (Rosiglitazone), and 3. Superimposition of PPAR LBD in the complexes with 14, 1,25 and 326 revealed differences in the proteinligand interactions (Figure 10). First, 14 formed both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with His449, while the only interaction between rosiglitazone and His449 was a hydrogen bonding interaction. The additional hydrophobic interaction of compound 14 with His449 was caused by the particular position of the indole ring. The indole ring of 14 moved toward the AF-2 helix region and adopted a conformation perpendicular to His449. Moreover, the indole ring also formed a strong hydrophobic interaction with Phe282. This interaction was absent in the 1 and 3 structures. In addition, the linker of 14 was 4 Å from the hydrophobic pocket of PPAR, 2.7 and 2.6 Å closer than that for 1 and 3, respectively, thus providing additional hydrophobic interactions with the protein. Conclusion In conclusion, a novel indole-based series of PPAR agonist compounds were synthesized and the structureactivity relationships were elucidated on basis of binding and functional activities at the PPAR protein. The n-propyl or n-butyl linker, 5-substituted indole, and the acetic acid head were most appropriate for potent PPAR binding and functional activity with a benzisoxazole tail. The compounds with 7-propyl-3-trifluoromethylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol and 7-propyl-3-phenylbenzo[d]isoxazol-6-ol tail part showed most potent activity. Based on the in vitro binding and transactivation studies, compound 14 was selected for the biochemical and in vivo evaluation. In vitro biochemical studies such as glucose uptake, adipocyte differentiation, and insulin sensitizer activity showed that 14 is an excellent candidate for further studies as an antidiabetic agent. The compound demonstrated highly efficacious glucoselowering activity in in vivo studies in KKAy mice, and an excellent pharmacokinetic profile. The structural biology studies of 14, a compound belonging to a new chemical class with indole as a core skeleton for the acidic head unlike many tyrosine-based PPAR agonists, revealed that the indole ring contributed strong hydrophobic interactions with PPAR and could be an important moiety for the binding to the protein. Compound

His449. In addition to His449, the indole ring formed hydrophobic interactions with Cys285 and Phe282. The indole ring contributed strong hydrophobic interactions with PPAR and could be an important moiety for the binding of compound 14 to the protein. Moreover, the indole ring could position the carboxylic head into the proper orientation for interaction with the AF-2 helix. The linker of 14 was close to the hydrophobic pocket of PPAR that consisted of Leu330, Met334, Phe368, Val339, and Met364. Finally, the tail moiety of 14 extended toward the lower part of the binding site and formed a hydrophobic interaction with Cys285.

Chemistry. Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were obtained with a Varian Mercury-300 spectrometer operating at 300 MHz, a Varian Mercury-400 at 400 MHz, or a Bruker DMX-600 at 600 MHz with chemical shift in parts per million (ppm, ) downfield from TMS as an internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were measured with a Finnigan (MAT-95XL) electron impact (EI) mass spectrometer. Analytical purity was assessed by RP-HPLC using an Agilent (Hewlett-Packard) 1100 series system equipped with a diode array spectrometer. Flash column chromatography was done using silica gel (Merck Kieselgel 60, No. 9385, 230-400 mesh ASTM). Reactions were monitored by TLC using Merck 60 F254 silica gel glass-backed plates (5 cm × 10 cm); zones were detected visually under ultraviolet irradiation (254 nm) or by spraying with phosphomolybdic acid reagent (Aldrich) followed by heating at 80 °C. All solvents were dried according to standard procedures. All reagents were used as purchased without further treatment unless otherwise stated. All reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. 4-(2-Chloropropoxy)-1H-indole (9a). A mixture of 4hydroxyindole (8a) (0.100 g, 0.75 mmol), K2CO3 (0.156 g, 1.13 mmol), 1-bromo-2-chloroethane (0.129 g, 0.90 mol), and 2-butanone (10 mL) was heated to reflux for 12 h and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The solids were filtered, and the solvent was removed under vacuum to afford an oily residue. The oil was dissolved in ethyl acetate (30 mL), washed with water (2 × 25 mL), followed by brine (1 × 20 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was removed in vacuo.

To determine the binding affinity of synthesized compounds to PPAR, scintillation proximity assay (SPA)27 was conducted based on the published procedure with some modification. Briefly, the ligand binding domains of hPPAR were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Recombinant proteins were isolated by affinity purification using glutathionesepharose following the supplier's recommendation (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). SPA binding assays were performed in binding buffer: 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mM sodium molybdate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/mL benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/mL BSA. [3H]-Rosiglitazone (60 Ci/ mmol; purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in ethanol and diluted to a final concentration of 10 nM under reaction. The recombinant GSThPPAR was added to the SPA binding buffer to a final concentration of 10 nM. Goat anti-GST antibodies were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (catalog number 27-4577-01) and were used at 400-fold dilution. Test compound (20 µL) was added so as to keep the final concentration of DMSO less than 2%. Protein A-yttrium silicate SPA beads were diluted as per the supplier's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The GST-hPPAR, goat anti-GST antibodies, and test compound SPA beads were diluted in assay buffer and combined in a total volume of 80 µL in the microtiter plate. Following the addition of 20 µL of [3H]-rosiglitazone to each well, the plate was incubated at 15 °C for 24 h with shaking. Radioactivity was quantified in a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Cell Culture and PPAR Transactivation Assay (TA). Huh-7 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well cell culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products), 100 units/mL penicillin G, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 24 h, transfections were performed with transfection reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, 11 988 387) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, transfection mixtures for each well contained 0.48 µL of transfection reagent, 40 ng of pcDNA3-GAL4/PPAR expression vector, 137 ng of pUAS(5×)-tk-luc reporter vector, and 0.245 ng of SV40-Ren as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated in the transfection mixture for 6 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were then incubated for another 24 h in fresh culture medium with various concentrations of test compounds. Since the compound stock solutions were prepared in DMSO, control cells were incubated with equivalent concentrations of DMSO. Final DMSO concentration up to 0.1% was shown not to affect the cell-based transactivation activity. Cell lysates were produced using Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined using Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) in a SIRIUS-0 luminometer (Berthold detection systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Measurement of aP2 mRNA. Confluent 3T3-L1 cells were incubated in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/mL

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, Vol. 48, No. 26 8207 penicillin G, 10 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate, 1 µM dexamethasone, and 150 nM insulin in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of test compound for 3 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Total RNA was prepared from cells using RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, 15596-018), and RNA concentration was estimated from absorbency at 260 nM. The aP2 mRNA was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) method with aP2 specific primers using the Roche LightCycler instrument (2 011 468). Statistical significance was evaluated by using Student's test by comparison of untreated samples with different treatment conditions. To compensate for multiple t test, P < 0.01 was set as the level of a significant difference. Preadipocyte Differentiation Assay. Adipocyte differentiation was detected by staining the lipids with Oil Red-O (Sigma) as described previously.28 In short, cells were fixed in 10% formalin for at least 1 h, stained by immersion in Oil Red-O for 2 h, and exhaustively rinsed with water. Excess water was evaporated by placing the stained samples at 32 °C. [3H]-2-Deoxy-D-Glucose Uptake Assay in Differentiated 3T3-L1 Adipocytes. The assay described by Mukherjee et al. was used.29 For the glucose uptake assay, 3T3-L1 cells were grown in 12-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Inc. Costar, Corning, NY) and differentiated into adipocytes with 0.25 mM 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine, 1 µM dexamethasone, and 2 µM insulin. Seven days after induction of differentiation, test compounds were added for an additional 2 days. After two rinses with serum-free DMEM, cells were incubated for 3 h in serum-free DMEM and rinsed at room temperature four times with freshly prepared PBS. The buffer was removed, and the cells were incubated with or without 100 nM insulin in PBS buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. The buffer was replaced with 1 µCi/well of [3H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) in PBS buffer supplemented with 100 µM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) with incubation for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and plates were rinsed carefully four times with cold PBS. Plates were drained briefly, and cells were lysed overnight in 0.7 mL/well of 0.1% Tritone X-100. Four hundred microliters of lysate was added to a scintillation vial, and 4 mL of Ecoscint A scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics; Atlanta, GA) was added. The vials were mixed and counted. In Vivo Studies in KKAy Mice. Adult male KKAy/TaJcl mice were purchased from Clea Japan (Tokyo), kept on a 12 h light-dark cycle, and provided with food and water ad libitum. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein, and blood glucose was measured using ACCU-CHEK from Roche (Mannheim, Germany). The mice were monitored for blood glucose and divided into groups of seven animals in which the average blood glucose levels among animal groups were similar. Compound 14 was given orally at doses of 1, 10, and 30 mg/kg according to the indicated dosing regimens. Animals of the vehicle control group were orally gavaged with 0.5% methyl cellulose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Blood glucose levels of the treated mice were monitored at the times indicated before, during, and after the treatments. Crystallography. Crystallization and Structure Determination. Crystals of 14/PPAR LBD were obtained by the hanging drop method. Typically, 25 µL of PPAR (8.0 mg/ mL in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA) was mixed with 0.5 µL of 14 (10 mM in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA) and equilibrated for 1 h on ice. The complex solution was then centrifuged for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was withdrawn carefully by pipet and used for crystallization trials. In the crystallization trails, 1.5 µL of the complex solution was added to 1.5 µL of well solution. The well solution contained 20% PEG3350. The complex crystals were obtained after 3-7 days at 18 °C. A crystal of about 0.2 mm in length was mounted in a 0.1-0.2 mm Cryoloop (Hampton Research, Inc.). The crystal was immersed briefly in a cryoprotectant containing 20% glycerol and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the NSRRC synchrotron facility

8208 Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, Vol. 48, No. 26 on station BL17B2 with an ADSC Quantum4. The data were processed by DENZO30 and reduced with SCALEPACK. The structure was solved by molecular replacement by MOLREP31 using a monomer of the published PPAR LBD structure (PDB code 2PRG) as the search model. The programs CNS32 and REFMAC33 were used for structural refinement and the addition of water molecules. Several rounds of refinement and model building were carried out with the program O.34 The coordinates of the PPAR-14 structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, ID 2ATH.
