Tile structural changes that occur on &and binding to haemoglobin have been studied by comparison of the atomic co-ordinates of human deoxy, horse met and human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin, using computer graphics and least-squares fitting methods. The changes that occur on going from deoxy to either of the liganded forms are very similar. These include tertiary structure changes within the ~~~~ dimer and a quaternary structure change in which the packing of al,!?1 against, &IS alters. no significant structural On going from deoxy to ligandrd llaemoglobin, change occurs in the central regions of the =lpl dimer, including the ml,!91interface and nearby helices B, C, G and H in both subunits. Movements occur in the outer part,s of the dimer, where the haerns, F helices and FG corners of both subunits move towards the centre of the molecule. The two haems and the two FG corners come -2 A closer together. One important effect of the changes in both subunits is to translate tile F helix across the face of the haem by ~1 A. Tlris moves tile haem-linked histidine F8 from a position that is asymmetric with rcxspect to thtx porphyrin nitrogens in deoxy to a more symmetric position in liganded llaemoglobin. Tile motion of t'he /3 llaem removes the ligand-binding site from the vicinity of ValPEll, which hinders ligand binding in deoxy. The changes ill tertiary structure are linked to the quaternary change through the rnot,ion of the FG corners. Tile C helicrs and E'G corners of %I/31 are in contact with tllr FG corners and C helices of c+j& in botll quaternary st'ructuros. In the ciuatrrnary change the contacts between a,FG and /?& and between G(,FG and &C' act as "flexible joints" allowing small relative motions. The same side-chains are inr,olvcd in the contacts in both structures. The contacts bet,ween a,C and fi2J?G and between a& and &FG act as "switch" regions, leaving two different, stahlc posibions with different side-chains in contact. The change between the two positions involves a relative movement of -6 A.

1. Introduction
Haemoglobin is a tetrameric protein molecule comprising two r~ and t,wo /? subunits. Each subunit cont,ains a haem group, at the centre of which is an iron atom to which oxygen, or another ligand, binds reversibly. The haem group is linked to the protein
part, of the subunit by a covalent bond from the iron atmom to a hi&dine residue.

known as the proximal hixtidine. The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin rises with increasing oxygen saturation, and the search for the sbructural explanation of this cooperativity, or haem-haem int'ernction. has made haemoglobin one of the most) intensely studied proteins. The three-dimensional structures of deox?- and ligandcd haemoglobin have been determined by X-ray analysis by Perutz and co-workers (Fermi, 1975; Hridner ef ml., 1977 ; Ladner et al., 1977). In both forms the tertia,rhe structures of the subunits art` similar, consisting of seven helical regions in the ccsubunits and eight in the /3 subunits with non-helical regions between hcliccl:: and at the a,mino and carboxy terminals (Wig. 2). However, the quaterna'ry st'ructurc of deoxy haemoglobin differs from that of liganded haemoglobin, and it has been shown thatS co-operativity is associated with t,ht quaterna,ry structure change that takes place during ligation (for a review. see Baldwin, 1975). Based on the comparison of the electron density maps at 2% B resolution and of atomic models of deoxy and liganded haemoglobin, Perutz (1970,1972>1976) INS proposed structural explanations of haemoglobin function. These proposed functional roles for the parts of the structure that sho\ved the largest unambiguous differences between the two forms at that resolution. These parts included the iron atoms, whose positions relative to the mean haem planes altered, and the carboxy-terminal residues of both cc and /3 subunits, which form intersubunit salt-bridges in deoxy, but not in liganded haemoglobin. Perutz (1970) also drr\v attention to the steric hindrance by which ValEll opposes ligand binding in t,he p subunits. The mechanisms proposed were set in the framework of a two-state allosteric model of co-operativity (Monod bonds that stabilize c;t uZ., 1965 ; Rubin t Changeux, 1966) in which the additional the low-affinity form were identified with the salt-bridges. Perutz suggested that the equilibrium between the two quaternary structures is governed by the distance of the iron atom and the proximal histidine from the haern plane in each of the four subunits. This distance: which clearly decreased between dcoxy and fully liganded haemoglobin. was proposed to decrease sequentially in each subunit as ligand was bound. Thr movement of the iron atom was proposed to initiate tertiary structure changes tahat caused gross movement's of the carboxp-terminal residues and broke the intersubunit salt-bridges. The cause of low affinity was attributed to the energy required to break the salt-bridges. The structural connection between the movements of the iron atoms and t,hose of the carboxy-termini could not I)e described and later results (Anderson. 1973,1975) suggested that such gross movements did not occur. Perutz has also

suggested (Perutz, 1972) that the reduced affinity of the low-affinity state is due to ;I "tension" at the haem imposed by the deoxy quaternary structure, which opposes th(. transition from the high-spin state of the iron atom in the absence of ligand to the low-spin st,at,e when ligand is bound. The structural basis of this tension could not be explained, however, although the idea that it was connected with the salt-bridges remained. Naps are now available at higher resolution, 2.5 A for human deoxy haemoglobin and 2.0 A for horse met haemoglobin, and the atomic co-ordinates obtained from these maps have been highly refined (Fermi, 1975; Ladner pt al., 1977). Takano (19773) and Ladnctr it al. (1977) have done qualitative comparisons of these co-ordinates and shown t.hat small differences in tertiary structure do exist in regions other than thcl carboxy-terminal regions. Chothia et al. (1976) have also determined which regions :ihow structural differences by quantitative comparisons of the alpha-carbon positions of these co-ordinates. We now have an additional set of co-ordinates, those of human c~arbonmonosy haemoglobin from 2% a data (Baldwin, manuscript in preparation). We have also had the use of a computer graphics display system, developed i)y Richardson and Pauling. This has aided our search for regions where structural clifferences occur and ha,s helped elucidate the relationship between the differences in various regions of the molecule. Quantitative descriptions of the relative positions of 4cct~ed regions of the molecule in liganded and deoxp haemoglobin have been derived with the help of a, computer program designed for such a purpose by McLachlan (1972). We present here a description of the structural changes in which differences other than the large ones at the carboxy termini are seen to be significant. The same c,ssentia I changes are found in both ccand jl subunits and when human deoxy haemoglobin is oompa.red with either horse met haemoglobin or human carbonmonoxy ha.emogIobin. These differences appear to be functionally important and, taken together with ideas from recent papers by Gelin & Karplus (1977) and Warshel(1977), they suggest the structural basis of the reduced a.ffinity of the low-affinity form of haemoglohin. Thtb role played by the proximal histidine in producing strain when ligand binds to the low-affinity structure is essentially that suggested by Gelin $ liarplus (1977). %urther study of the intersubunit contacts at the S~1j12 interface has shown how trrtia'ry and quaternary structure changes are coupled, and has confirmed arise from the different ligand binding that the allosteric properties of haemoglobin properties of two quaternary structures in equilibrium with each other. A summary of the important differences in structure between deoxy and liganded haemoglobin t,hat will be established in the first part of the paper is as follows. (1) The structure of the interface between subun&s a, and pl. see Figures 1 and 2, is ident.icnl, within t.he accuracy of our co-ordina,tea, in hu~nan deoxy and carbonnlonoxy haemoglohin and is essentially t'he same in horse met ha,emoglobin in spite of ;\tnino acid sequence differences. The ul/S1 interface therefore gives a frame of reference fi )r the description of tertiary structure changes. (2) In addition to the ~$3~ interface. a, large central portion of the c,& dimer keeps clssentially t,he same structure in deoxy and liganded haemoglobin. This region includes I IMPB. (`. G :LJ~ H helices of both subunits and the D helix ofp. The structures of thr% corner regions between these helices are not known sufficiently accurately to prove itlcntit?; of structure but they probably do not have functionally significant differences. (3) The regions where significsnt st,ructurai changes occur between liganded and urrligand(ad halemo$obin include the hacmx, the F helices, FG corner regions of both

subunits and the E helix of /3. The tertiary structure changes associated with the movements of these regions are dissipated at' the beginning of the G helix in both subunits and at the EF corner in z and the beginning ofthe E helix in /3. (4) On going from deoxy to liganded haemoglobin the c( and p haems move further into the haem pockets by ~0.5 A and 1.5 A, respectively (see Figs 3 and 4). These movements bring the haems within the c& dimer closer to each other by -2 8. A rotation of the haem relative to the E helix and a& interface is significant (9") in the p haem only. This rotation combines with the fi haem translation to remove the ligand binding site from the vicinity of the ValEll side-chnin, whose presence hinders ligand binding in deoxy haemoglobin (see Fig. 5). (5) In both subunits of deoxy haemoglobin. the imidazole ring of the proximal histidine F8 is in an asymmetric position with respect to the porph,vin nitrogens of the haem, such that the atom Cc,, is closer t,o N,,, than the atom CcdI is to S,,,. This asymmetry was first pointed out by Gelin & Karplus (1977), who have proposed it,s functional significance. On going from deoxy to liganded haemogiobin bht? F helix is translated across the haem plane 1)~ ~1 ,k and is tilted with respect, to it (set Fig. B(a)). This movement of the F helix takes the: proximal histidincl from it's asymmetric position in deoxy to a more symmetric position in ligandrd haemoglobin. The tilting of t#he F helix is associated with a movement of the iron atom t'owards the haem plane. (6) Conformation changes at the end of the P helices accompany the tilting of the F helices relative to the haems. The motion of t'he F helices and FG corners relative bo the x&II interface is such that the centrcs of the FG corners of the x1 and PI subuuits move toward each other by 2.5 .A. (7) The haemoglobin t,etramer is formed by association of the x1/31 dimer with conbacts bet\vcen & and a2. cc,& forming contacts between a1 and /3z and symmetrical The C helix and FG corners of a1 contact the FG corner and C helix of pz (see Figs 2 and 9), in both deoxg and liganded forms but t8here is a quaternary structure change (see Figs 7 and S), which results from changes in these contacts. There is a small movement at the contact between a,FG and /I&. whilst, t'lrere is a large movement of -6 w at the contact between a,C and ,&FG. (8) The contacts between x,FG and j3,C and between a,FG and &C act' as "flexible joints" and involve exx&ly the same sida-chains Ijut wit'h different detailed conta&s in the t#wo quaternary structures (see Fig. 12). The contacts between fiz FG and alC regions, having two distinct, stable posit8ions and between plFG and a& act its "switch" \\rhich have different side-chains in contact in the two quaternary st,ructures (set Fig. 13). The steric barriers to a direct slide i,ct,wern these two positions are conceutrated \vhere the side-chains of His/397(FG4) have t)o pass t,he side-chains of Thra41

of & makes stable contacts with the FG corner of a1, only because the structure of the liganded nlPl dimer has the two FG corners the correct distance apa'rt, 25 A less than t'hrir distance apart in the deoxy aI/31 dimer. Similarly, the separation of the FG corners in a deoxy c& dimer is such that the FG corners pack against QC: and /3,C in the deoxy qua.ternary structure. The evidence for these ten points is given in detail in the following three sections. The later part of the paper relates t'hese structural changes to the functional properties of haemoglobin.

2. Choice of a Reference Frame for the Comparison of Deoxy and Liganded Haemoglobins
The tetramerie molecule of haemoglobin is represented schematSically in Figure 1. *-I dyad axis (Y) relates the c& dimer to azPz. Two pseudodyad axes, perpendicular to the true dgad and to each other, relate the a and /3 subunits. The interfaces between the subunits are of two kinds, between cc1 and ,E$ and between CQ and fi2. The aI& interface is shown schematically in Figure 2: which is the CX$, dimer of a model of haemoglobin in which helical regions are represented as rods. The CC~/C$ dimer is viewed at the interface it makes with a,pz, looking along the +X axis. The difference in quaternary structure between liganded and unliganded haemoglobin occurs at the interface between the X& dimer and the ~.$a. The interface between subunits a1 nnd ,R2 is show-n in Figure 9, which is t,he c+& dimer viewed at the interface it makes with `x&I~, looking along the -2 axis. Since liganded and unliganded haemoglobin differ in their tertiary and quaternary structures, there is no fixed reference frame for comparison of the structures. We have chosen to superimpose the structures at the al/l1 interface for the following reasons. Ladner of rd. (1977) compared their high-resolution electron density map and their refined atomic co-ordinates of horse met haemoglobin with those of human deoxy Iraemoglobin (Ten Eyck & Arnone, 1976; Fermi, 1975) and found no significant differences between the two maps a,nd the two sets of co-ordinates in thisregion, excepts for those due to differences between the human and horse amino acid sequences. The similaritv of structure extends to the sites of water molecules bound in the interface. l!sing t,hr co-ordinates of these struct,ures after energy refinements (Levitt,, 1974)) (Ihothia et al. (1976) compared the alpha-carbon position of the C& dimers hy a leastsquares fitting procedure, and showed that there are essentially no differences in their relative posit'ions in the +I1 interface. A comparison of the electron density map of 1~uma11 carbonmonoxy haemoglobin (Baldwin, manuscript in preparation) with that of human deoxy haemoglobin also shows no differences in this region. lNore detailed comparison of the main-chain and side-chain conformations of all three structures, which we will describe below, also suggests its suitability as a. reference region.

haemoglobin

The c+/I~ interface is formed by parts of the B, G and H helices of the M.subunit packing against t'he B, G and H helices of the /3 subunit (see Fig. 2). The contacts between helices aB and ,8H ; aG and /3G ; aH and BB form over three- quarters of all the contacts at the interface. The PD helix also contributes some contacts. The residues in the contact region are a30 to 36 (B helix) ; a102 to 113 (G helix) ; ~117 to 127 (H helix) ; /330 to 36 (B helix) : 851 t'o 55 (D helix): ,9107 to 132 (G and H helices).

of 338 atoms of these residues were superimposed by the least-squares fitting method of McLachlan (1972). All main-chain atoms and the atoms of those side-chains forming contacts with the opposite subunit were included in the calculation. The root-meansquare (r.m.s.) difference between the superimposed co-ordinates of human deoxy and human carbonmonoxy hnemoglobin is 043 A, which is within the r.m.s. error expected in view of the errors of the individual sets of co-ordinates (see Section 7). This small r.m.s. difference demonstrates that the structures at the c& interface of the deoxy and liganded forms of human haemoglobin are identical to within the accuracy of the co-ordinaks. The r.m.s. difference between the superimposed co-ordinates in the corresponding regions of horse met and human deoxy haemoglobin, excluding side-chains not common to both species. is 0.49 A. Also when the co-ordinates of horst met nnd human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin arc each separatelg superimposed on tleoxy haemoglobin, the r.m.s. difference between t,hem is 0.43 A. Neither of these r.m.s. values indicates a significant diffcrcnce in the st,ructurc in this region between horse and human haemoglobin. This region therefore forms a suitable frame of reference to use in the search foi simikities and differences in st,ructurc in other parts of the three molecules. Having chosen the a& interface as the reference region, furt)her comparison of skuctures will be done using co-ordinate sets and electron density maps that are superimposed at the P& interface. Transformation matrices. calculated bv the leastsquares fitting program, were applied to the horse met haemoglobin co-ordinates and to those of human carbonmonoxv ha~emoglobin to superimpose each set on those of human deoxy harmoglobin. The electron density map of carbonmonoxy ha,emoglobin was reorientated to superimpose on Oilat of deoxy haemoglobin. With co-ordinates and maps in this orienta,tion, differences between liganded and unliganded al/ll dimers are t&iary structure changes and differences between the a2/& dimers are the sum of tertiar\- and quaternary structure changes. The tertiary structures of the alfil diniers will 1)~ compared first, and the yuaternary changes will be described later.

3. The Tertiary Structures of the Deoxy and Liganded aI& Dimers
(a) Rigid ad moving prt.s of the c& dimer Examination of the superimposed electron density maps of human deoxy and human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin shows that a large part of the aI& dimer has a very similar conformation in both structures. The following regions of the molecule, which include the residues forming the a$, interface, show no significant differences : the B helices of a and 1, the C helix of a and the D helix of 8, the G helices of both a and /3 except for the first few residues, and the H helices of a and p except for the last few residues. In contrast, the superimposed maps show clear differences in the position of the haems, the F and F't helices and FG corners of both subunits and in the E helix of /3. ln addit'ion, the amino- and carboxy-terminal residues of both subunits can 1~. seen clearly in the eleckon density of the map of deoxp haemoglobin but not in that of carbonmonoxy haemoglobin. A quantitative measure of the similarity or difference in tertiary structure of each region of the dimer is given by the r.m.s. difference between the superimposed coordinates. Table 1. columns (a). gives the r.m.s. differences found for main chain and

beta-carbon atoms in the separate helices and corner regions of the cxand /3 subunits. Values less than 1.5 o (see Section 7 and footnote to Table 1) indicate identity of conformation. It can be seen that aB, aC, aG, aH, PB, /?D, /IG and /3H have the same conformations in all three structures. The corner regions at the ends of these helices. AB, CD, GH of both a and fi subunits, give rather large r.m.s. differences but these arc not significant, compared to the expected error in co-ordinates in these less cleat regions of the maps. They could be due either to genuine differences in conformation or to ambiguities in model building. Tn contrast, helices crF, aF', /3E: /3F and /3F' and corner regions aFG and /3FG, all well-defined in the maps, show r.m.s. differences between deoxy and liganded haemoglobin greater than 1.0 A. These differences arc significantly larger than the 0 values for the comparisons. Also the r.m.s. differences for the haems are significantly greatct t,han the differences that could be attribmed to the errors of the haem co-ordinates. These regions t'herefore have either a change in position or a change in conformation I)ctween liganded and unliganded haemoglobin. Columns (b) in Table 1 give the r.m.s. differences obtained when one set of coordinates for each separate region is rigidly rotated and translated relative to the othcl so as to minimise the difference between t,hem. A small value in column (b) combined \\ith a large value in column (a) jndicates a similar conformation but an altered position relat,ive to the LX&?~ interface. If bhe value in column (b) is large compared to (r, some conformation change is indicated. The next section will discuss these regions \\-here there arc significant changes in position and conformation. The remaining regions, KA and /3A, ctE and PC. show r.m.s. differences that' are marginally significa~nt and difficult to interpret. The A helices show a larger difference between species than between ligat'ion states. This difference in A helix position and conformation has also been found between human and horse deoxy haemoglobin ( Prrmi, 1975). The comparison of carbonmonoxy and deoxy co-ordinat'es suggests that xA has a small conformation change nsxociat'ed with ligation, possibly connected \vitlr the differcncc in conformation of t)he amino-terminal residues. Thus the dimcr can be considered to have a large central region, namely helices B> (`, D. G and H of both subunits. which keeps essentially the same structure in liganded and unliganded haemoglobin, and outer parts associated xvith the regions a,round the Iraenls and FG corners where the backbone alters its posit,ion and/or conformat'ion. (I)) Th,e tertiary structure changes that occur on ldgand biding

The r.m.s. differences in Table 1 demonstrate that significant differences in structure between deoxy and liganded haemoglobin occur at the haem, the F and F' helices and t)he FG corner of bot,h subunits. Differences are also seen in the E helix of the /3 subunit, and to a srnaller extent in 6he E helix of c(.

shifts that occur between the various parts of the subunit on going from deoxy to liganded haemoglobin are presented in Table 2. The shifts are derived from the rotation and translation parameters that, when applied to one set of co-ordinates for each region, give the minimum r.m.s. difference (columns (b) of Table 1). between the two sets of co-ordinates. The components of shift are given relative to axes in the deox? haem to enable the directions of the shifts to bc visualised most easily. The pyrrole groups of the haems are numbered in Figure 2 so that Figure 3 can be relat'ed to the overall structure. For helices. shifts are given for the centre, and for the beginning and end of the helix axis, in order to show the effect of rotation as well as translation. This representation does not demonstrate any rotatSion about the helix axis, but in no cast: was such a rotation found to be significant'. Figure 3 illustrates that, on going from deoxy t'o liganded haemoglobin. the haem group has shifted significantly further into the haern pocket. 0.6 A (05)f in a direction

There is no significant translation perpendicular to the haem plane, and the calculated rotations, 1%" (1*6")t, are about different axes and are insignificant. Figure 3 also illustrates that the backbone of the F helix moves with the haem. The centrc moves 0.4 A (0.1 8) perpendicular to the haem plane. It also moves the same distance as the haem parallel to CHo,-CH,,, and about 1 B more than the haem parallel to CHo,-CH,,,. The different shifts calculated for the beginning and end of the F helix show that the helix tilts and turns relative to the haem plane, with the end 88(F9) moving toward the haem plane and across towards pyrrole 3.

The way the I'G corner side-chains adapt to thtb quatprnury structure change will bc discussed in a later section. The movement of t'ho FG corner is dissipated at t'he beginning of t,hc 0 helix as illust.rated in Figure 3. Two residues near the beginning of G form the buck of t,ha haem pocket,. These are Phe98(G5) and 1,~~~~101 (G8). and the side-chains and thr backhoncx move in the same dire&ion as the haem. to\vards the central cavity of the ~IoIwuI~. Thr rest of t'hr?

The end of the H helix packs against the: F and I?' helices and the haern. and their movement is accompanied by changes in thv last few turns of the H helix as shown in Figure 3. Residues 135 to 139(H18 to HCl) adapt their main-chain conformations slight'lp. The side-chains of LculSB(H19) and Va1132(H15), which contact the haem. have unchanged conformations. The carboxy-termina,l residue &gal41 (HCS) is clearly seen in the electron densit), The carboxyl group of a,141 is salt-bridged to t,wo amino map of dcoxy h~em~g~OkJin. and of t,hc amino-terminal groups in the opposite x chain: thoscb of Lysaz127(H10) residue Vala,l(SAl) (see Fig. 15). l'hc side-chain is bonded to the carbox,vl group of Aspa,126(H9). to t'he carbonyl group of Valfi,34(B16) and also to an anion that `lies between it and the amino group of Vala,l (Arnoneet al., 1976).

(ii) l'he p siiOunil The tertiary structure differences in the /I subunit are qualitatively similar to thotie occurring in K. The relative positions of the haem and the E, F, G and H helict>s of deoxg a,nd carbonmonoxy haemoglohin are illustrated in Figure 4. In the liganded structure the hattm has again moved further into the haem pocket, by 1.5 Ak (I .2) in il direct)ion parallel to the Iine joining Ncl, to N,,,. There is negligible movement of the centre of the haem perpendicular to its plane but a significant rotation of the haem. 9.6' (9.2"), about an axis essentially in the haem plane and along the lint joining IN-,,, to Kc+,. One effect of the rotation is that, on going from deoxy to liganded haemoglobin. pyrrole 1 moves towards the side-chain of Lys66(ElO). Pyrrole 3 moves towards t'he side-chain of Phe103(G5), which points out from the G helix between the hacm and the F helix. The shifts of the haem centre and of the atoms in the ctbtltral part of the haem that move most with the rotation are given in Table 2. The F helix, including residues 85 to 93(Fl to F9), shows r.m.s. differences of 041 ,A (0.23) as opposed to 0.67 i% (0.40) for residues 85 to 95(Fl to FG2) showing that, as with the x chain. there is a change in conformation of residues FGl and FG2 (thesa rcsiducs are part of a rr helix). The Table gives the shifts undergone by the fiF helix. The side-chainr of Phe%(Fl), Leu88(F4), Leugl(F7) and His92(F8) undergo slight collform;~tion changes to stay in cont,act with the haem. Cys93(F9) is in a t;uit,ct different conformation in deoxy and carbonmonoxy hacmoglobin. In deoxyhaemoglobin thtb sulphydryl group point,s out into solut'ion. In carbonmonos>. haernoglobin it points in toward t)hr: pocket between helix F and helix H, whilst thtb Tyrl45(HC%) side-chain that is located here in deoxy haemoglobin is shifted out of its way but remains partially in tho pocket,. This conformation of Cys93 confirms t.hc conclusions drawn from a difference rnap of horse met and carbonmonoxy hacmoglobin (Heidner it ul., 1976). In met, hsemoglobin the sulphydryl group is in cquilib iium bctwt~en the two positions. `I'hc movement of the F helix is continued by the F' helix residues 80 to 86. The E Mix tilts and turns relative t,o the deoxy haem plane, as shown by the movement of the h&x tlnds in t,he Table. The different directions of the mot,ions of the end of E and tIhtJ beginning of F' are accommodated by flexibility a,t the EF corner.

The movement of FG is dissipated in the first few turns of the G helix, as in the tc subunit. Residues Phe103(G5) and Leu106(06) form the back of t)he p haem pocket and they adapt to the shifted position of the haem. The rest of the G helix has identical conformations in all three structures and forms pa,rt of the K& intersubunit contact.

The sideamino group of Lysa,4O(C5) thus forming an inter-dimer chain of the histidine is hydrogen bonded to the carboxyl group of Asp&94(FGl) giving an intra-subunit link.

In deoxy haemoglobin the Tyr side-chain is hydrogen bonded to the carboxJ-1 group of Va198(FG5), whilst in liganded hnemoglobin it spends only some of its time bonded to this group. (iii) DtIfjeremes
between the shifts to the two liganded jiirnze

The values of the shifts in Table 2 show a high degree of similarity between the shifts to human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin and to horse met, haemoglobin. The similarity is closer for the shifts in the GIsubunits than for some of the shifts in the ,5 subunit, which are slightly larger when calculated from the human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin co-ordinates. The fine detail in the values obtained for the shifts in r and/3 depend critically on how the dimers a,re superimposed, but the differences seen in Table 2 reflect a small but real difference in the tertiary structures of the aJ1 dimers of horse mrt hactmoglobin and human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin. Further evidence of this difference is seen in the relat'ive positions of the centres of the regions XC, aFG. /3X and ,f3FG in the two ligandetl dimers. The distances between the centrcs of L-XC arld aFG, aC' and /X, aPG and PC in alpI (and a.$,) are very similar in the two structures. However, /3FG and IPG art: separated b.y 25.1 a in horse met haemoglobin and by 24% L$ in human carbonmonox,v haemoglobin. whilst /3FG and aC are separated I)y 27.7 -1 in met a,nd 27.1 A4 in carbonmonoxy harmoglobint. This small difference in st~ruc:t,urt~ of thtx dimers must be a consequence of amino acid sequence differences betw(~c~rl horse and human haemoglobin. rather t'han a consequence of the different ligand. AS no differences as large as these were seen in the difference olect,ron density map of horse cnrbonmonoxv-met haemoglobin (Heidner et al., 1976). The exact shifts brt,n-ecn droxy ;lnd met haemoglobin arc therefore not available, as ie is not known whtthc~r t,hr small tertiary structure difference between horse and human exists also in the deoxy st,ruct~ure. The small differences t'hat we observe here in the calculated shifts to the two liganded forms thc%refore have no functional significance. Very small but significant differences betwclen horse carbonmonoxp and met haemoglobin have hcarn described cpuditat'ively by HAdner et al. (1976) f rom their difference electron density map, which provides a more sensitive method of comparing structures than does tflrr comparison of two independent sets of atomic co-ordina.tes.

An important consequence of the change in tertiary structure between an unliganded and a liganded subunit is the difference produced in the protein environment of the ligand binding site at the haem.

of the haems and nearby parts of the protein, and it will be helpful to examine the changes in the protein relative to superimposed haem groups. The shifts of the centres, beginnings and ends of the E and F helices relative to the haems are given in Table 3. The figures show that the movement of aF relative to the CLhaem is very similar to that of /3F relative to the /3 haem. This is so, although the magnitudes of the shifts and tilts of these helices and haems differ between a and /3 when calculat,ed relative t,o the alpI interface (Table 2). The aF helix shifts across the harm plane by 1 a in the CH (2,-CHo, direction and has a small component of turn. For fiF the shift, in the CH,,,-CHo, d'Ire et'ion is a little smaller, 0.7 A, and the turn a litJtlc larger. In addition, both F helices tilt relative to the haem plane so that their F9 ends. 88 in a and 93 in /?, are 0.8 A closer to the haem planes (see Fig. 6(a)). These nlotions of thtl F helix have the following important effect on the positions of the proximal histidines. In deoxy haemoglohin. the imidazole ring of Hi&8 of both a and /3 snlmnits is in an asymmetric position with respect to the haem plane. The plane of thr imidazole ring is approximately perpendicular to the haem and its projection on the hacm plane is a line at ~20" t'o the line joining the nitrogen atoms of pyrrole rings 1 and 3. The imidazole ring is tilted so that the CcE)a,tom is closer to N,,, than t,he atom is evident in the co-ordinates given by Fermi (1975), C (6, is t,o iSc3). This asymmetry but MXS first nohed as being important IJy Gelin & Karplus (1977). In deoxy the distance of Vce, from N,,, is 3.2 A in a a'nd 3.5 a in /3, whilst, the distance of C,,J, from NC,, is 3.8 3 ill x and 4.2 A in Pt. Tl le d'IS dncC of the iron atom from the mean haem plane %a is 0.6 ,A IC_0.2 in both a and /I. The changes observed on binding ligand, namely the translation of the F helix across the haem and the tilt of the end of the F helix towards the haem. bring the imidazole into a position where the ring can be made symmetric relative to the haem by a small side-chain conformation change. It also has the effect of moving the imidazole ring and the iron atom towards the haem plane. Thus the proximal histidine and iron atom mow nearer the haem plane. and, at the same tirnta, the atoms (I,,, and C(d) become more nearly equi-distant from the porphyrin nitrogen atoms. I tl carhonmonoxy haemoglobin the distance of Cc,, from X,,, is 3.1 Lk in a and 3.2 x in p, whilst tJhe distance of C,S, from jS,,, is 3.4 A in a and 3.2 ,!%in pt. The distancc of the iron atom from the mean harm plane is 0.04 A f 0.2 A in a and 0.2 .A + 0.2 w in /3. The combination of branslation and tilting is seen in the transition of x and /3 subunits to both met and carhonmonoxy haemoglohin. These motions ha,re implica'tions for the difference in affinity for ligand of Dhe two stru&urcs. as will be explained in the next section. The tilt of t'he F helices is discontinued beyond residues F9 by means of the conformation changes already described in se&ion 3 b(i) and (ii), so the residues of the F(: corners that are haem contacts do not move toward the haems. `I'hc fiaurc>s for aE in Table 3 emphasise that there is no motion of the centre of aE:

((1) Con~parison with previous

The tertiary structures of horse met haemoglobin and huma'n deoxy haemoglobm have been compared previously by comparison of electron density maps and atomic models (Perutz, 1970; Fermi, 1975: Takano, 1977b; Ladner et al., 1977). Differences between met and ca,rbonmonoxp haemoglobin of horse have been described from a differcncr density map (Heidner et al.. 1976). We have included information from a ne\v map of human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin in our comparisons and our analysis has used least-squares fitting of atomic co-ordinates over small regions of the molecule to help describe where significant changes occur. Our result's show some qualitative similarities with those concluded from earlier work. Albhough our description of the changes is in some respects less detailed, it, has provided a more accurate and quantitative picture of certain important changes and has stressed the coherence of the various
changes.

4. Comparison of Quaternary Structures of Liganded and Unliganded Haemoglobin
(a) The quaternary structure change The quaternary structure change t'hat occurs on ligation of haemoglobin can 1)~: simply described as follows. If the al& interfaces of deoxy and liganded haemoglobin arc superimposed, the overall movement of the a&& dimer interface relative to CC& is a rot,at,ion of 14.9" (12.3") and a translation of O-8 A (1.2 A) (see Fig. 7). The rotation axis (P) passes essentially through the molecular dyad. perpendicular to it, at a point beta-eru the a subunits 12 A (18) from the molecular centre. The rotation axis is at 18.0" (18-6) to the X axis and 72.0" (71.4) to the 2 axis. The translation is along the same axis as the rotation. The effect of the quaternary structure change on the relative positions of the four subunits, when the c1& dimer moves relative to the alpI dime1 going from deoxy to carbonmonoxyr haemoglobin, can be seen in Figure 7. f12 slides past' a1 (and /J1 past a2) in approximately t'hr YZ plane, as the component of movement due to the rotation is in the plane YQ and this is combined with the translation componcrn perpendicular to the plane YQ (Fig. 8). Parts of M~near t#he rotation axis move closer to al; as only the translation component is significant. The detailed geometry of the quaternary change as calculated for the transition from deoxy to carbonmonoxy :md to met is given in the legend to Figure 7. The small but significant difference twtwecn the calculated quaternarp change to human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin and tjhat8 to horse met haemoglobin is related t,o the small tertiary structure differences between the two liganded structures that have already been described. The above description for the quaternary change between human deoxy and horse met haemoglobin is an alternative description to those that have been given previously (Muirhead vt al.. 1967 : Chothia et a,Z.:1976) and all three descriptions are consistent with each other.

Figure 9 illustrates that the regions that contribute contacts a,re the C helices and FG corners of both subunits.

between the C helix of a1 and the PG cornt'r of /&. between the FG corner of al and tht C helix of &, and between the two FG corners. There are very few contacts between the two C helices. There are also the dgad-relat'ed contacts involving subunits z2 and ,6,. Table 4 shows how the centres and ends of these regions differ in position between deoxy and liganded haemoglobin. Thr shifts are relative to a fixed a,j, dimer. Deox~ and carhonmonoxy haemoglobin have been superimposed at the aI/31 interface as in the previous section. This means that the shifts for the different parts of a1/31 are tertiary structure changes, whilst those for the different parts of a2& are the sum of the tert,iary changes and the rotations and t~ransla~tions of the quaternary change. The shift components are given para,llel to the molecular axes of deoxy haemoglobin. As already described in the section on tertiary structure changes. the centres and ends of helices sc,C and p,C do not move significantly relative t,o the a& interface, whereas the ccntres a,nd ends of a,FG and &FG move by 1 A or more. The shifts of the regions in the a& dimer relative to the a,bl interface superposition are much larger, a,PG moving 2.5 A, /&C moving 4 A and &FG and a& moving 6 A. Figure 8 illustrates in some detail how the centres and ends of these regions change position as a result of the tertiary and quaternary structure changes from deoxy t,o carbonmonoxy haemoglobin. Figure 8(a) is projected in t)he plane perpendicular to t,he rotation axis of the overall quaternary change, looking from a.& towards a&, i.e. the same view as in Figure 7> whilst Figure 8(b) is project,cd perpendicular t'o the Y axis. These Figur(xs illustrate the following points. (I) /3$ crosses a,PG, f12FG crosses x,C, a,FG crosses /3,C and a& crosses /3,FG in 1)ot.h forms. This is seen in Figure S(a), whilst Figure S(h) shows t,he separation in the X direction of the regions that cross ea.ch other. (2) In carbonmonoxy ha,emoglobin. a,C and &C are essentially unchanged from t,hrir droxy positions, whilst8 a,FG and /$FG show the tertiary structure changes that move, them towards each other hy ahout 2.5 A. (3) The rotational part of the quaternary change is a rotation of 14.9" about an axis perpendicular to the plane of Figure 8(a). through a point of the daoxy dyad axis that is 12 w from the molecular centre. between the a subunits. After the chsnge the dimers zIpl and a2p2 art` related by a dyad axis that,, in t,he projection of Figure S(a), crosses the droxy dy%d axis at the point of rotation. The translational part of the quaternary change moves t*he whole of x& in the dir&ion $-P by 0.8 A. This is seen in Figure t)(h), whrrt~ thcl quaternary change is shown resolved into component,s parallel and to the YQ pla.ne. perpendicular (4) Th(s tnovcments of a,C and /3,C arc essentially just those of the overa quat,ernary

(5) x,FG moves less than the overall quat,ernary change; whilst /3,FG moves slightl) more. -it the contact between a,FG and /&C (an d similarly between a,FG and plC), the quat,ernary and tertiary changes combine to lessen the total relative movement, \\rhich is ahout 2 .A. In contrast, t,he quaternary and tertiary changes combine to givcb a large rclat,ive movement of about 6 w for fllFG relative to a,C (and for &FG relativcb t'o a,?!). (6) Figure S(b) shows the movements that take place perpendicular to the plane of Figure 8(a). In addition to the translation component, 0.8 A, of the quaternary change, the only significant small shifts perpendicular to YQ due to t,ertiar.y structure changes arc those of &FG and /&FG.

changes combine to give shifts for /&FG and M& that are essentially perpendicular to the X axis. See also the components of shift in Table 4. In the earlier section discussing tertiary structure changes it was seen that the relative positions of the centres of a,C. /llC. or,FG and fi,FG differ slightly hetwwu horw met haemoglohin and human carbonmonoxy haemoglohin. x,C and plC art separated by the same distance, whilst a,FG and &l!G arc3 sepa,rated I),y 0.5 A less in human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin. These tertiary differences are associated with a slight difference in packing of the CK#~ dimer against a&& in the two liganded forms. This small quaternary difference is illustrated by comparison of corresponding distances across the molecular dyad. The separation of the centres of plC and /3,C is O-6 .k smallet in horse met haemoglobin than in human carhonmonox,v haemoglobin. In contrast the separations of a,C and fi2C, a,FG and cc,FG, PIFG and /I,FG are 09 A. 0.8 x aud 0.3 at respectively greater in horse met haemoglobin. The differewes in position of the contact regions between horse met and human carhonmonwy ha,emoglobin aw given in pa,rentheses in Table 4, and examinat8ion of them in conjunction with Figurr 8 will emphasise that, they con&itute a sma.11 pert,urb:ttion relahivr to t,hc quaternar> structure change between deoxg and carbonmonoxy haemoglobin. Par the contact between alC and /3,FG. there is a difference bctwwn thy two liganded forms of onl?; 0.4 8, in the position of PzFG relat'ive to xIC. Thus the way /3,FG contacts v.,(' is very similar in horse met and human carbonmonoxy haemoglohin. For t'he contact between plC! and a,FG, however. there is a difference in position of a,FG wlat,ive to /3,C of -1 A in t,he t,\l;o liganded forms. so that thck \~a>- plC crosses QFG must. diffw s!ight,ly in t#he two liganded structures.

Three residues of x,FG, Arg92(FG4), Asp94(Gl) and Pro95(G2). and two residues of /3&, Trp37(C3) and Arg4O(C6) contact each other as can be seen in sections (a) of Figure 10 a'nd in Figure 12. These residues and their side-chains form two U-shaped sections that interlock in both liganded and unliganded haemoglobin. The actual atom to atom contacts in the two structures differ but there is no gross change in packing, as can be seen in Figures 10 and 12. Arga92(FG4) and Arg/340(C6) have different side-chain conformations in the two structures. Thus the change in quaternary and tertiary structure, which shifts the helix axis of pzC relative to that by keeping the arrangement of of alFG by about 2 A ( see Fig. S), is accomplished int,erlocking side-chains the same whilst changing their conformation and atomic contacts.

Figure 10 and also in Figure 13. In deoxy haemoglobin, the side-chain of His/&97(FG4) packs between Thra,41(C6) and Proa,44(CD2). The side-chain of Asp/Q99(Gl) forms a hydrogen bond to O,,,H of Tyra,42(C7). In liganded haemoglobin, Hi@,97 packs between Thra,38(C3) and Thra,41 and the side-chain of Asp/?,99 no longer forms a hydrogen bond. The dyad-related contact between a,C and /3,FG can be seen in section (a) of Figure 10. The change in quaternary and tertiary structure shifts /3,FG relative to a,C and &FG relative to SC& by about 6.0 $ (SW Fig. 8). There is little change in the conformations of the side-chains in the two st,ructures but, in contrast to the fi,C-a,FG contact,, a gross change in t,he packing. This region has the characteristics of a switch. iu that there are two distinct stable packing arrangements and any intermediate po&ion would be unstable. For the movement between the two structures to take place, the side-chain of Hisp,97(FG4) has t'o move past the side-chain of Thra,41(C6), as illustrated in Figure 13. This interaction and the dyad-related one between P,FG4 and z,C6 seem to be the major steric barriers to the quaternary change. The side-chains involved in these contacts are the same in horse and human haemoglobin, and the packing here is the same in horse met and human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin. (iii) a,FG-/3,FG: a,FG-j3,FG

This contact and the dyad-related one can be seen in section (b) of Figure 10. (iv) a,C--j3,C: a&-j&C group of Arg/3,4O(C6) is in contact with the side of the phenyl The guanidinium in deoxy and liganded haemoglobin, and in the liganded form group of Tyra,42(C7) only it hydrogen bonds to the carboxyl oxygen of Thra,41(C6).

and Arga,l41 In deoxy haemoglobin, the last two residues of al, Tyra,l4O(HC!B) (HC3), close pack in a crevice in the a& interface where they pack against residues 34 to 37(B16 to C3) of p2 and hydrogen bond to Aspa,126(H9) and Lysa,127(HlO) (Fig. 15). The rotation of azpz relative t'o alp1 on the quaternary structure change would have little effect on the Arga141(HC3) side-chain contacts, as can be seen in Figure 8(a), where the position of the Ccc, atom of the side-chain is plotted. On the other hand, the translation component of the quaternary structure change moves the a&& dimer 0.8 a closer to a&. This movement combined with the tertiary structure changes at the end of the H helix, described earlier, means that the end of the H helix comes ~2 A closer to the opposite dimer, so that there is no room for the Arga,l41 side-chain to retain its deoxy position. In liganded haemoglobin, Argal141 points out into the solvent, and Tyra,l40 side-chain becomes delocalised. Tyr/3,145(HC2) and Hi$,146(HC3) are in contact with Thra141(C6) and Proa,37(C2) and hydrogen bond to Lysa,40(C5) in deoxy haemoglobin (Fig. 16). The quaternary structure change

5. Structure and Function of Haemoglobin
The biologically significant propertics of haemoglobin arise from the modulation by the protein of the intrinsic ligand a,ffinities of the haem groups, and from the transmission of effects in one subunit to the ot.her subunits. In this section we will combine the ideas that arise from our structural analysis described above with those of other a,uthors to give a description of the stereochemical basis of the function of haemoglobin. This description will be qualitative and must, be regarded as a tentabivc preliminary t,o quantitat,ive descriptions t,hxt may be derived eventually from calculat'ions of the energies and dynamics of haemoglobin (Warshel, 1977 ; Gelin & Karplus, 1977; Hall, manuscript, in preparat#ion).

Relwtionship

between ligand a@n.ity axd structure

Quantitative calculations of the energies associated with the various structural changes t,hat might occur at the haem group on ligand binding have been described recently by Warshel (1977). Warshel point,s out that the most favourable geometry for a haem-ligand complex is influenced by t 11-ofact'ors. otw due to the size of the iron atom itself and t.he other due to t,he axial ligands to which the iron is bonded. For a five-co-ordinated high-spin ferrous complex. as in deoxy haemoglobin, the t'wo factors combine to give a preferred posit,ion of t,ht: iron atom out of the plane of the porphyrin nitrogens. The radius of the iron atom is 2+6 .A: whilst the distance from the haem nitrogen is 2.01 f! , so t)he optimum position of the iron atom centre to each porphyrin alone is out of the haem plane, as previously noted by Hoard (1966). Steric repulsion between the porphyrin nitrogens and the axial ligand, the NcE) of the proximal histidine in deoxy haemoglobin, also favours the out of plane position. Warshel estimates that if the iron atom is prevented from being out of the plane, the major part of the strain energy (-3 kcal) comes from the stcric repulsion between the NC,, and the r&rogens. His calculations indicate that t.he haem is flexible enough to accommodate

the large iron atom with only a small expendit,ure of energy (<O$i kcal). For a sixco-ordinated low-spin complex, as in earbonmonoxy haemoglobin, the two factors combine to give a preferred position of the iron either in or very close to the plane of t'hc porphyrin nitrogens. The iron a,tom radius. 1.94 A, is less than 2.01 .& so that the optimum position for the iron atom alone is in the plane. St)eric repulsion hctween t,he porphyrin nitrogens and the two axial ligands prevents either ligand approaching the plane too closely. The exact position of the iron atom is t,hat which minimises tShe total steric repulsion, and for most pairs of ligands it will bc in t'hc plane of the nitrogens. If the iron atom is prevented from taking up t(his most favourable I'osition, the major contribution to the strain energy comes from the st'eric repulsion between the porphyrin nitrogens and the closer ligand. Only i-l small strain energy is associatrtl with the small iron at,om being out, of the nitrogtbn plant. In t,he case of haetnoglobin, it is t,hc prott+n structure that may put const,raints OR the movement of t,he iron at,om. If the iron i\t,otrl cannot move to its opt,imum posit,ion on ligand binding. the strain induced is reflected in a reduced affinity for the ligand. The conformation of t'he prot'ein-harm complex \\?I1 adapt itself t'o minimisc t,he total strain, nhich will be distributed as &ric repulsion between ligantl a.nd porpllyrin. strains in the porphyrin, Arains in iroll-ligand bonds and strains in the protein. Thtt affinity of t,he haem group for the ligand will bhus depend OII how freely the iron atom ca,n move between its most favoursblr positions ~-hen the ligand binds and leaves. The affinity of haemoglobin for it,s first ligand is smaller t,han its affinity for the fourth liga,nd by a factor of 150 to 300, depending on solution condit'ions. The affinities of the isolated c( and p subunits and of sperm whnlc myoglobin arc a litt'le smaller than that of haemoglobin for it.s fourth ligand. Thrsc~ latter affinities are similar t.o tllat of :I. model compound with an imidazole axial lipand (Collma~l cf rxt., 1978). Values for thcsc affinities, talrcn from the literature, arc prt+cbntrd in Table 6. We will atttmpt to relat(t some of these affinities to the featurcbs iI1 t hc known protein st,ructurcs that drtermine how easily the iron atom can movts. (i) Deozy haemoglobirt, Gelin $ Karplus (1977) have attempted to calculate t'hc structural changes that From their would occur on ligand binding to an x subunit of deoxy haemoglobin. energy calculations, an interesting idea concerning t,he origin of the locv affinity of deoxy haemoglobin has emerged. Their calculations suggest that the unliganded haem in deoxy haemoglohin is not, subject to significant steric strain, so that the iron atom is in its optimal position for five-co-ordinat.cd high-spin ferrous iron. Their calculations arc supported 1)~ experimental evidence t,hat they quote, which shows that, the geomet,ry of the haem in deoxy haemoglobin is very similar t'o that in an isolated haem group. ,A recent paper by Eisenberger et al. (1978) confirms this latter point. Gelin & Karplus show that, if the iron atom t,ries to approach the haem in t'he x subunit of deoxy ha.emoglobin. steric repulsions involving the proximal histidinr: and the parphyrin arise. We mentioned earlier that they point'ed out that the imidazole ring of the proximal histidine in both a and fl subunits is tilted so that CcE) is closer to N,,, than C,a, is to Nc3).

and is hydrogen bonded to the main chain. They show that' t'he strain is lessened by a small tilt of the haem group, but the rest of the protein is too closely packed to allow enough movement to take place to relieve the strain. More recent energy calculations by Hall (to be published) agree with this description in general but suggest' that the assumptions made in the calculat,ions present'ed by Gelin & Karplus lead to an overestimate of t'he importance of t'he part'icular contact between Cc,, and NC,,. Hall's calculations suggest a more distributed origin of the strain. associated with the position of the whole of the F helix. The low affinity of deoxy haemoglohin for its first ligand is thus seen to originate in the strain induced by the steric repulsion arising from the position of the F helix and. in particular, the position of the proximal histidine, relative to the haem. Such a mechanism does not depend on the exact radius or spin-stat'e of the iron atom but onl,v on the change in haem geometry that would like t,o accompany the change from five-co-ordinat,ion to six-co-ordinat)ion. This mechanism is therefort: not subject to the criticism made by Little & Ibers (1974) and by Eisenberger et al. (1978) of the mechanisms proposed by Perutz (I 970,1972). Ln the case of the /3 subunits, t'here is additional strain associated with steric hindrance between the ligand and atoms of tht: ValEll side-chain (Perutz, 1970). Our analysis suggests that the kind of movements reyuired to relax the strain in both cc and /? subunit's are prevented in deoxy haemoglobin hy the close-pa'cked contacts betn-ten neighbouring subunits at the a1/32 and R.$~ interfaces. The FG corners cannot move because of their interaction with the C helices of the other subunits. These contacts stabilise the tertiary st,ructures in the vicinity of t,he haems.

(ii) The fourth

ligand to bind to

haemoglohirt

AS we showed in the earlier section, in both c(and p subunits of liganded haemoglobin the F helix is shifted so that the proximal histidine is in a more symmetric position relative to the haem. In t,his ca,se t'he iron atom is in the haem plane without introducing large sterio repulsions. There is less stra,in when t,he ligand is bound and the affinity for ligand is therefore high. The more symmet,ric position of the histidine is brought about by the tertiary structure change in each subunit involving the shift and tilt of the F helix relative to the haem. Most of this tertiary structure change OCCWJ when the quaternary structure changes tjo that of t,he liganded form, irrespective of the presence of bound ligand in the particular subunit. To achieve the correct close packing at the subunit interfaces in the liganded quaternary structure. t#he FG corners of x1 and p1 move t'owards each ot,her by 2.5 A. The translation of both hacms into thr haem pockets, t,he rotation of the p haem and the shifts of the F and E heliocs accompany the movement of the FG corners. The close-packed interfaces therefore stabilise t,he more symmetric position of the proximal hist'idine in both subunits. and in thr /3 subunit the position and orientation of the haem that allow room for the liga.nd. (iii) Myoglohin Sperm whale myoglobin has a ligand bindin, v affinity that is a factor of 3 less than that of haemoglobin for its fourth ligand but a factor of -50 great,er than t#hat of haemoglobin for its first ligand. Takano (19771) 1 shown that, the t.ertiary structure ) las rhanges that, occur on ligand binding to sperm whale myoglobin are much smaller than those that occur in haemoglobin, although t,hey are in similar directions. On going from dcoxy to met myoglobin, the iron atom, proximal histidine aud F helix, and the FG corner move about (1.15 -4 towards the haem plane. Figure 6(b) compares the positions of the F helix in deoxy myoglobin with that, in the c( subunit of carbonmonoxy haemoglobin after the haem groups have been superimposed. The P helix in deoxy myoglobin is shifted across the haem plane relative to it,s position in deoxy haemoglobin towards so that in deoxy myoglobin the Cc,, the position it has in liganded haemoglobin, and C,a, atoms of the proximal histidine are almost equally distant from t,he porphyrin 15 IY has a much higher nitrogens, as not'ed by Takano (19776). Th',, .I why rnyoglobin affinity than that of deoxy haemoglobin for its first ligand. Why is the affinity of mgoglobin not as high as that of hemoglobin for its fourth ligand? The P helix position in myoglobin is somewhat intermediate between t'hat in dcoxy and that in liganded haemoglobin subunits (SW Fig. G(b)). This is demonstra,ted by the distances ldxveerl the proximal histidine and the haern plane in the tllree structures in the legend to Figure 6(b). The itlt~rrmediate nature of the structure is further illustrated by the distances betwwn t,he iron at,orns and the mean haem plane in the various myoglobin stJructurw tllat have berm studied. The distances arc (Takano, 1977u,b; 0~55 A& in dcoxy, 040 ,& in met and 0.33 ;i iu oxy myoglobin Pl~illips, 1978). The iron atom is therefore not as close to the haem plane in liganded myoglobin as it is in liganded haemoglobin (see earlier section). The probable reason for t,he difference in the way the F helix and FG corner pack against the haem in at myoglobin and in liganded haemoglobin lies in the amino acid replacements ljositions FG1 and FG3. In both M and /3 subunit,s of haemoglobin, these residues are lJeu@`G1 and ValFGL3, whereas in sperm whale myoglobin they are the somewhat larger residues HXFGI and IleFG3. These larger residues prevent the cmtre of the _k` llclix from approaching as close to the hacm (Big. 6(b)).

Since the iron atom is held further out of the haem plane in myoglobin than in liganded haemoglobin, the affinity of myoglobin is slightly smaller than that of haemoglobin for its fourth ligand, because there will be great,er steric repulsion between the sixt,h ligand and the porphyrin nitrogens.

Collmalt et al. (1978) have recently synthesised compounds that model the behaviour of haemoglobin iu the binding of ligands. One such compound (Fe T Piv PP(NMeIm), we Table 5). which has an imidazolc group bound as axial ligand to the iron atom, has a high affinity. u.hilst a second compound (Fe T Yiv PP(Mc,lm)), which ha.s a methyl group 011C,,, of t,hc imidazolc, has a much reduced affinitp for Zgand. The presence of with the porpllyrin nitrogen. t,he m&h!-1 group on Cc,, will cause steric interwtion which iti similar to that produced in deoxy haemoglobin by the asymmetric position of the histidine. The similarities in affinities of model compounds and haemoglobin are coincident,al but, their relative values provide confirmation of the idea that the reduced afinity of deoxy ha.emoglobin originates in the steric repulsion between tht wymmctric proximal histidine and the porphyrin plane. (b) The allosteric mechanism We have seen that the low affinity of haemoglobin for its first ligand arises because the posit.ion of the F helix in the deoxy quaternaryjtertiary structure is such that the iron atom att,ached to hi&id& FS cannot move into the haem plane without steric wpulsion. The strain induced cannot br relaxed, because the F helix is not free to move in t)he necwsary direction. What, restrains the F helix ia the close-packed interf:,~w Iwt.wrn t,tw FG corner of t,he subunit and the C helix of the neighbouring subunit ~twoss t,hc ~$3~ interface. In contrast, the high affinity of haemoglobin for its fourt,h l&and arises because the position of thr P helix in the liganded quaternary/tertinr,v struct'ure is such that the iron a'tom can be close to the haem plane without inducing &ain. 111the liganded quaternary structure t'he close-packed int,erface between the FG corwr and the C helix of t'he neighbour has changed to sbabilise this alternative posit'ion of t#he F helix relative t,o the ha,em. I II tjlw s&ions comparing tertiary and quat,ernary structures, we pointed out that the liganded structure has the two FG corners of the o$~ dimer closer together by 2.5 :\ than they are in the unliganded structure. Stable close-packing of the X& a,nd cQ1 interfaces is only possible when the FG corners of a1 and ,!?Iare the correct distance: apart for making the 1xJ3~and cc&$ contacts of one quaternary structure or the other. Thus as far as t,he positions of t,he FG corrws, and therefore the F helices, are conwrtwd there appear to be t,wo stable st,ructures, the deoxy quaternary structure with it* characteristic position of t'he F helix associated with low afinity. and the liganded quaternary structure with its shift,ed posit,ion of the F helix associated with higll affinity. Co-operativity, that is an increasing affinity for a ligand as ligand binding prow&. can he a'cbieved by the molecule changing ibs quaternary structure. Thr previous paragraph, which shon-s how the nature of the inter-dimer interface in haemoglobin imposes a degree of symmetry on t,he individual subunits, suggests a t.n-o-state mechanism for allosteric intera.ctions as proposed by Monod et al. (1965) and Rubin $ Changeux (1966). This typtb ot mechanism has Iwen invoked for haemoglohin befo1.c by Perutz (1970,1976) and the results of many types of experiment

on haemoglobin have been interpreted successfully in terms of a two-state model (Baldwin, 1975 ; Edelstein, 1975 ; Shulman et al., 1975). The original MWC theory of allosteric interactions was presented as a model in which bhe number of parameters \~a:: less thau the number of observations, namely the four binding constants of the oxygctl quilil)rium curve. This involved the restriction that no interact'ions occurred between subunits \z ithin one quaternary structure. From a structura'l point of vieI+-, however. small iut'eractions of this kind are likely if the ligand binding sites are near to the subunit, interfaces, and t'he affinity of each subunit could be modulated by the tertiary structure of urighbouring subunits as well as by t'he effect of the yuaterna,ry structure change. The larger the distance between binding sites and interfaces the smaller the tertiary &cct is likely to be. The essential element description is t'hwt t'hcre are t\vo yuaternary structures in eyuilibrium, of a two-state with different, binding properties for ligand and for promoters or inhibitors. If the modulatiou of the affinit,ies due to the structural changes that occur without the change in yuaternary wt'ruct'ure is small compared to that, produced by the yuaternary structure change, many of the predict)iorrs of t#hc si tnpk modf!l still apply. b For a two-stat,c mechanism to operate, thr~ `I' (low affinit,y) form of the protein must be more sta,blc than the R (high affinity) form whf~n t,hcasubunits arc unliganded. Whp is t'he struchurc T, mor(t stable thnu that, of R,! Since thcl affinity of the R-state of haemoglobin is vqv similar t,o tlrc affinit)y of tlw q/31 dirncsr (Hcwit,t tt 02.. 1972); it follows that' the free energy of dissociation t,o dinrctrs of tht: R, structure is very similar to that of the structure R,. Also t hc free t~tlc~rg~.ctrangc between the structures T, and R,. RT log L (where L = [To]/1 R,]). is c~yual to the difference between the free energy changes associated \vith the dissociation of T, to dimcrs and R, to dimers. Thus the st'ructural rca,sous for T, being more stal)le t)han R, can be scetl I)y examining the structures of T, (dcoxy hacmoglobin) and It., (fully ligandcd haemoglobin) snd looking for an cxplanat#ion of the different, dissociation c*onsta,ut8s of t.hesc t\vo struct)ures. Chot~hia et aZ. (1976) have s11ou~l how th(b relative dissociation constants can 1)~ understood in terms of the greater surface area remof-ed from contact with water when two & dimers come together to form deoxy haemoglobin than when they form liganded haemoglobin. This makes the dcox~- cluaternaty structure tnore favourable dur. principally. to its greater hydrophobic ruergy. The major contributions to the difference in the t,wo buried surfact: areas are associated with the carbox?;-berminal residues t,hat, form the inter-dimer tlydrogen t)onds, that, are present in deoxy haemoglobin but absent in liganded haemoglobitl. The structural changes that occut' m4len ligand binds without change of yuaternary structure have been described both in the R structure (Perutz & Ten Eyck, 1971) and in the T structure (Anderson. 1973.1975). Each of these studies exploit)ed abnormal haemoglobins or abnormal conditions t#o maintain droxy haemoglobin in the liganded quaternary structure or liganded haemoglobin iu the dooxy yuaternary structure.

As more ligands are removed. the yuaternary structure changes to T because tllis is the more stable in the abscncc of ligand for the reasons just given. Anderson's results show how the structure adapts to strain when the T-state subunits

are ligandrd. Sma,ll structural changes occur in the region of the F helix and FG corners but none of these is as la.rge as the differences we have observed between deoxy and fully liganded haemoglobin. The haem groups tilt slightly, consistent with the haem trying to avoid close corltact with C,,, of the proximal histidine. The iron atoms move slightly, but not all the way into the haem planes. Slight shifts in orientation of Tyra140(HC2) and Tyr/3146(HC2) occur but t,hcre is no gross movement here and the hydrogen bonds made by t,he carhoxy-terminal residues are not broken. Thus the changes noted by Anderson are very much smaller and rather different in kind from those seen between deoxy and normal liganded haemoglohin. All t'he changes seen are consistent with the idea that low affinity in ttte T state arises from the strain induced by ligand binding and that' st'eric repulsion op~~ose:s the movement of the iron atom into the plane of bhe haem. In Anderson's aquomet-deoxy diffcrencr map, the asubunits only had bound ligand. The small t.ertiary structure changes in the x subunit, ha.d extended to t.he EJ~, intcrfacc but there was no indication at that resolution of structural changes being transmitted to t)he /3 subunit. It should be noted, however, that' structural changes need not be transmitted into the p subunit' in order to alter its ligand affinity. A change of structure at the interface could make it easier or more difficult for t'he ,B chain to relax the strain of ligand binding at its haem. The intersubunit packing of the X& interface is such that the regions that interact most strongly are the FG corners of one type of subunit and the C heliccs of the other. Although the FG corners are close to t'he haemn and appear to undergo small tertiary structure changes on ligation in thra T state, the C helices are far from the haems and show little indication of change on ligation in the T state. These contacts are therefore probably not designed to enable the sub1tnit.s to influence each other until the quaternary structure change occurs. The cont,acts between the two FG corners involve ends of side-chains only. One hydrogen bond. involving different residues in the two quaternary structures, is formed bttxveen the CQand the /I2 subunits. The possibility exists that movements at one FG corner due to ligation influence the Affinity of the neighbour subunit through alterat'ions in strength of the hydrogen bonds. However. the energy associated with changes in orientation of these hydrogen bonding groups is likely to be small, as there arc water molecules in the a& int,erface hydrogen bonding to these same residues. Such int'eractions might increase or decrease the affinity of the neighbouring subunit, to a small extent. The nature of the a& interface in ha,emoglobin and of its linkage with the harm groups therefore suggciat:: that thtl tertiary structure changes wit,hin t.he T state on ligand binding would have onIy a sma,ll effect on the affinity of &et, subunit.s. artd tmht:major contribution to co-operatirity comes from the yuaternar> htructurt: change. 11~the following paragraphs we will describe very briefly how the structural interprct,at'ion of haemoglobin function given above relates to some of its other allosteric: propertirs

understood, since removal of the stabilising intcra&ions in the `1' state that the carboxyterminal residues provide will raise the fraction of molecules in the high-affinity form, i.e. it will decrease the value of L. The increase in affinity of the T-state subunits has the following implication. The low affinity of t'he T state depends on how easily the subunit can relax the strain induced l)y ligand binding. lf the part of the structure that is involved in t'he relaxation is made more flexible by the removal of residues that were previously close packed or by the removal of hydrogen bonds that previousI\ held parts of the structure rigid, then the strain can be rclwxed more easily and the affinity will be increased. (ii) The effect of twgan ic phosphates The organic phosphates 2,3-diptlospllogl?-(~~~t.~~t~~ and inositol hexaphosphnte bind to deoxy haemoglobin at, a site on the molecular dyad between the p ellains (Arnone, 1972; Arnone & Perutz, 1974). The phosphates bind to the a-amino groups and to His2 (IriA2): Lys82(F'3) and His143(H21) residues of the p subunits. These molecules bind much less strongly to liganded haemoglobin and the binding site is not known, there being insufficient room for them to bind between the 6 chains in the liganded quaternary structure. The presence of organic phosphates affects the functional properties of ha.emoglobin in that t,ho overall oxygen affinity is decreased, and, in addition, the T-state subunit affinity is decreased (Tyuma, et al., 1973). The strong binding of phosphates to the T state and the weak binding to the R state provides a straightforward cxplanalion of the decreased oxygrn affinity. A possible reason for t,lrc: decreased T-state affinity is as follows. The small tertiary structure changes that, take 1Jla.c~~ try tv relax the strain when ligand binds in the T-state p subunit involve the to P helix. The presence of 1HPt binding t,o I?;sinc>SZ(F'3) will bc a further r&raint on t,his relaxation of t.he subunit. thus decreasing the subunit affinity. Since bound IHP lowtars the affinity of T-state /3 subunits: the binding of l.HP will be weakened when a ligand is bound to one /3 subunit in the T-state. The affinity of the neighbouring /3 subunit \zill be slightl>r increased thereby. This means that t'hc oxygen equilibrium cwvc`s of haemoglobin in the presence of 1HP (and DPG) cannot be described by a simplr set of two-state model paramct'ers (Szabo & liarplus, 1976). Xevertllek5s. t,hc &,uc%ural origin of tlrc, c+Frct that organic pllosphates have 011 oxygen binding is that they bind morct strongly. t,o the lo\{,-affinity form of hacmoglobin than to the highaffinity form iI1 equilibrium \vit h it,. (iii) The Bohr ejfecl The oxygen af5nit.y and co-operativity of haemoglobin depend on pH. II> the alkaline pH range, protons bind more strongly to dcoxy haemoglobin than to fully liganded haemoglobin, resulting in an increase in oxygen affinit'y as the pH is raised. Most of the protoll binding sites have been identified (Kilmartiu, 1977; Nishikura, 1978) and there is a structural understanding of why two of these sites bind protons in the T state but not in the R st#ate, that is of wh,v pH affects the value of L. Recent data 011 accurate oxygen equilibrium curves over the full saturation range (Imai & Yonetani, 1975; Kilmartin et al.: 1978b) show that for normal haemoglobin the T-state affinity also increases with increasing pH. This means t#hat some or a,11 the interactions that of contribute tjo the Bohr effect must also contribute to constraints on the relaxation of strain when ligand binds in the T st'ate.

effect is the hydrogen bond between His146fi(HC3) and Asp/394(FGl) that is present in the T state. A second contribution comes from the interactions between a group of residues in the internal cavity of the molecule between the a chains. This group of which contributes the proton, residues includes the a-amino group of Vala,l(NAl), the side-chains of Lysa,127(HlO), Aspa,6(A4) and Aspa,lZB(HS), and the carboxyl group and side-chain of ArgaJ41 (HC3). A chloride ion bound between the r chains also contributes to the interactions (Arnone et al., 1976). A third contribution is associated with Hisz122(H5) (Nishikura, 1978) but there is at present no structural explanat'ion for its change in pK between deoxy and fully liganded haemoglobin. The result that the T-state affinity depends on pH implies that the way the strain of ligation in T is relaxed depends on the pH-dependent strengt'h of at lea,st some of these interactions. At, low pH, thestl bonds are strong and the relaxation of straiu is more difficult. At high pH these bonds are weaker and the strain can be relaxed more easily. The exact, st'ructural origin of t)he change in pK of the Bohr groups that occurs on going from t'he dcoxy to the liganded T stat'e is not clea'r. Whilst in the fully liganded It st'atr t,lre Bohr group hydrogen bonds t'hat account for a la'rge fract,ion of the Bohr protons arti clearly broken, in the liganded T state they retain positions at the subunit interfaces that a,re similar to those in the unlignnded T state (Anderson. 2973.1975). This is seen in the diff(Jrencra electron drnsit'y map of aquomet haemo,globiu, \vhicll shows the T quat'ernary structure with the M subunits liganded, and in haemoglobin Kansas. which shone t,he `I t'ht: diff~~rmce ma,p of carbonmonox> quatrrnar~ struct,ure with the ,8 subunits liganded. The results from these maps arcs not consisteut with the mechanism proposed by Perutz (1970), in which sequentia,l rcleasc of protons wa's associated with large movements of the carboxy-terminal rc~siduc~s.The maps do show small shifts in the F helix? however. and it is possible that t8hrrc~are small changes in t'he position and orientation of some of t'he residues associatcd \zith the Bohr effect that a,re sufficicbnt to account1 for the altered pK. As alread? mentioned. no large difference has bccu found in the cnvironmont' of Hisa122(H5) in deox)- and fully liganded haemoglobin. yet it has been shown to contribute ~15(!{, of t tie Bohr protons. Thus incrcasiny the flexibility of the T-state subunit8s increases t'heir a,ffinity bar making it ea.sier for them to relax the strain of ligand binding. Decreasing the flexihilit!- has the opposite effect. The small structural changes t)hat occur on ligand binding in the T-state subunits may influence t,he affinity of neighbouring subunits to :I slight, extent, and t'he changes are not' necessarily t'he same in all conditions and for all nlutant and modified haemoglobins. Kilmartin ef al. (1978a) have expressed a similar view of t'ho properties of the T stat'e. The underlying mechanism of co-operativity. however., remains the same in a11 conditions and depends on an equilibrium l)c:tweon t1i.o quatcrna'ry structures that differ in their affinity for ligand. The origin of this differcsnrc iu afinitv lies in thus differ?rcuce in relative position of the F helix and t h(, haem in each subunit and. in the ,Q subunits only, in the diffi:reuce in relative I)osition of' the haem and E helix, Thr t\vo alternat,ivc structures around the haflm arc dcbr~rmiurd 1)~.the ta-o alternative packings of the alpa interfaces.

binding site. We have also seen that the change in geometry at one site is not produced by direct propagation of structural changes induced by the binding of liga,nd at another site. Only very small structural changes occur on ligand binding to a subunit unless the quaternary structure changes, and these seem to extend only as far as the inter-subunit interfaces. Although such structural changes at the interfaces may cause some modulation of the affinity of a neighbouring subunit, we believe that the large change in affinity in haemoglobin is associat'ed with the change in geometry of the haem environments. This is produced by the change in close-packing of the a1/32 interface that is the essence of the quat'ernary change. WC have also seen how the linkage between the large quaternary cha,ngc and the small tertiary changes ensbles the regulation of the ligand binding properties k,y organic phosphates. These conclusions from our study of haemoglobin are consistent with the general results of Levit't (1972) and Gelin $ Iiarplus (1975). who have shown that the shift's in atomic positions that are induced by stcric repulsions are dissipated within a short distance. This is because the strain energies are relaxed by small local changes in bond and torsion angles and in bond lengths. Strain cn~~`rgy at one site can be used to transfer a structural change directly t'o another site only if the sites arc close together. In haemoglobin the binding sites are separa,ted hy large distances. 23 x (a1 to /3J, 31 A (x1 to a2), 37 A (cc1to pl) and 39 A (fil to p2); whilst each site is about, 12 A4 from an a& interface. Where sitrs are separated 1)~ a large distance, modification to the structure of each site can be achieved indim@/ by using two different modes of closepacking i.e. having x "two-stat,e" pr&ein. If thesr: two st.rnctural states hxve only a mcderate difference in energy so that thcsy arc? ill equilibrium with each athcr, the decrease in stability of the lower afYinit)y form caused by the st'rain of ligand binding leads inevitably to a,n increa,sing fraction of molecules in the higher affinity form. In a two-&ate mechanism it is not, necessary for atomic movements to bc propagated diwcthy over a large disbnnco from the SOUN:Cof the strain : i\ change in structure is achieved in&e&y t,hrough alt,cring the cquilihrium bctwcacbn two alternative st,ructures.

7. Note on the accuracy of Co-ordinates,

Superpositions and Shifts

The r.m.s. errors in the atomic co-ordinat,cs of the three structures can be estimated from the a'greement bet,ween observed and calculated st,ructure amplitudes by the method discussed by Fermi (1975). The values obtained are 0.25 A. 0.40 L%and 0*55 A for horse met, human deoxy and human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin, respectively. These are average values of the errors throughout the structures. Tn interna. segments of the structures. where the electron density maps are clear, the r.m.s. error of co-ordinates is smaller than the average value by a factor of 0.7 (see Fermi, 1975), giving 0.18 d, 0.28 A and 0.39 a for the r.m.s. errors of co-ordinates in such regions. The expected r.m.s. difference (a) between superimposed co-ordinates of essentially identical structures in internal segments ia therefore 0.48 A for the comparison of human deoxy with human ca,rbonmonoxy, 0.43 A for human carbonmonoxy/horse met and 0.33 A for human deoxy/horse met hnemoglohin. In our analysis we have assumed that t,herc is no evidence t,hat structures real1.y differ if the r.m.s. difference between t'he co-ordinate sets is within 1.5 0. Thus r.m.s. values less than 0.7 A, 0.65 A and 0.5 A for the three types of comparison are taken to indicate

similarity of structure, and r.m.s. values greater than 20 are taken to indicate a significant difference in structure. The error in the position of the centre of a region is smaller by a factor dn than the r.m.s. error in each co-ordinate, w-here n is the number of independent observations in the region. Since the co-ordinates have been refined with the atoms bonded 0.6 times the number of atoms included. Thus u for the together, n is approximately -30 atoms is 0.12 B for transitions from shifts of the centres of regions involving dcoxy to carbonmonoxy: and 0.09 A for transitions from deoxy to horse met haemoglobin. The errors in the shifts of the ends of a' helix axis are double the errors in the shifts of the centres. of the structures and at the ends of the chains, where the In the corner regions ele&on density maps are less clear. the r.m.8. errors are larger than the average value for each structure. The co-ordinates of the hccemCs are more accurately determined than those of the rest of the st,ruct8ures. ,4 comparison between the haem co-ordinates in the deox? hacmoglobin t.ctramer, before symmetry averaging about the non-crystallographic dyad axis. sloops the haem co-ordinates to have an r.m.s. error smaller than the average' value by a factor of 0.4 (G. Fermi, personal communication). Assuming similar relat'irr> accuracy in the other two struct,ures, the r.m.s. errors in the haem co-ordin)y atIes are 0.10 A. 0.16 A and 0.22 A, respectively. Thus the values of o for the superimposed haem co-ordinates are 0.27 A. 0.24 8, and 0.19 A for the three types of comparison. The centres of the haems can be superimposed with an error in the shifts of 0.16 Lh and 0.11 w for the comparisons deoxy/carbonmonoxy and deoxy/horse met haetnoglobin. respectively. The orientation of the superimposed haems can bcx obt,aincd with errors of 2.1" and l+", respectively. ln expressing shifts of helices relative to superim,posed haenw, t,he total error is >L combination of the errors due t'o positioning and orienting the haems and in th(! drt.crmination of the centre and ends of the helix. The largest contribution to th( error comes from t'hc uncertainty in the orientation of the haem. as the error from this increases with increasing distance from the haem. At 10 A from the haem centre, t,htb error duo to misorientation of the haems is 0.37 a for the comparison deoxy/carbonIIIOIIOX~ ;Ind 0.26 Lk for the comparison deoxy/horse met haemoglobin. The total
