The g-butyrolactone-type autoregulator/receptor systems in the Grampositive bacterial genus Streptomyces regulate morphological differentiation or antibiotic production, or both. The autoregulator receptors act as DNA-binding proteins, and on binding their cognate ligands (g-butyrolactones) they are released from the DNA, thus serving as repressors. The crystal structure of CprB in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), a homologue of the A-factor-receptor protein, ArpA, in Streptomyces griseus, was determined. The overall structure of CprB shows that the g-butyrolactone receptors belong to the TetR family. CprB is composed of two domains, a DNA-binding domain and a regulatory domain. The regulatory domain contains a hydrophobic cavity, which probably serves as a ligand-binding pocket. On the basis of the crystal structure of CprB and on the analogy of the characteristics of ligand-TetR binding, the binding of g-butyrolactones to the regulatory domain of the receptors is supposed to induce the relocation of the DNA-binding domain through conformational changes of residues located between the ligand-binding site and the DNA-binding domain, which would result in the dissociation of the receptors from their target DNA.

Introduction
The Gram-positive bacterial genus Streptomyces employs g-butyrolactones as autoregulators or microbial hormones, together with their specific receptors (g-butyrolactone receptors), to control morphological differentiation or antibiotic production, or both.1,2 The representative of the g-butyrolactone autoregulatory factors is A-factor (2-isocapryloyl-3R-hydroxymethyl-g-butyrolactone), which is essential for aerial mycelium formation,3 streptomycin production,4 streptomycin resistance,5 and yellow pigment production6 in Streptomyces

griseus (Figure 1). Experiments involving [3H]Afactor showed that a homodimer of the A-factorreceptor protein (ArpA; 276 amino acid residues, 29.1 kDa) binds A-factor with the dissociation constant, Kd ; of 0.7 nM, in agreement with the extremely low effective concentration in vivo (1029 M) of A-factor.7,8 ArpA binds the promoter region of adpA encoding a transcriptional activator and represses its transcription in the early growth stage when the concentration of A-factor is still low.9 When A-factor reaches a critical concentration, it binds the DNA-bound ArpA and dissociates ArpA from the DNA, thus inducing the transcription of adpA. AdpA induced in this way activates a number of genes required for secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation, thus forming an AdpA regulon.2 Other various Streptomyces species contain A-factor homologues and ArpA-like proteins.1 Figure 1 shows some g-butyrolactones from Streptomyces.

Although the ligand for CprB is still unknown, it recognizes and binds the same nucleotide sequence as does ArpA.15 In addition, genetic study has revealed that CprB serves as a negative regulator for both secondary metabolism and morphogenesis, as ArpA does in S. griseus.16 Here we report the crystal structure of CprB, which is the first report regarding a g-butyrolactone receptor. The crystal structure of CprB has revealed that gbutyrolactone receptors belong to the TetR family. CprB is folded into ten a-helices and is composed of two domains, a DNA-binding domain and a regulatory domain. The cavity found in the regulatory domain seems to be a ligand-binding pocket. Conformational changes upon ligand binding, on the basis of the structure and the data from the site-directed mutagenesis, will be discussed.

and dissociating it from the target DNA in Streptomyces virginiae,10 SCB1 that controls antibiotic biosynthesis, together with an ArpA homologue, in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2),11,12 and IM-2 that controls blue pigment production in Streptomyces lavendulae.13 The structures of these autoregulators, having a 2,3-disubstituted g-butyrolactone skeleton, are very similar. The A-factor/ArpA-like systems are therefore thought to be a common regulatory system controlling secondary metabolism and/or morphogenesis in the genus Streptomyces.2 In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the repressor function of ArpA, we performed sitedirected mutational analyses of ArpA.14,15 The replacement of Trp119 by Ala abolished the A-factor-binding ability but not the DNA-binding ability.15 Conversely, the replacement of Pro115 by Ser abolished the DNA-binding ability but not the A-factor-binding ability.14 These two residues are conserved among the g-butyrolactone receptor proteins. An amino acid replacement in a helixturn-helix DNA-binding motif in the N-terminal region abolished the DNA-binding ability but not the A-factor-binding ability.15 These findings suggest that ArpA is composed of two independently functional domains, an A-factor binding domain (or regulatory domain) and a DNAbinding domain, and that the A-factor signal can be transferred between the two domains upon Afactor binding, resulting in the dissociation of ArpA from the DNA.14 However, the detailed structure­ function relationship of ArpA as well as other g-butyrolactone receptors remains unknown because their three-dimensional structures have not yet been determined. Our repeated attempts to obtain crystals of ArpA for structural determination failed, because ArpA aggregated very readily in solution. We then tried to crystallize CprB, an ArpA homologue protein in S. coelicolor A3(2).16 CprB shows approximately Structure determination CprB was crystallized in three different forms, Ia, Ib, and II.17 Of the three, the crystal structures of forms Ia and Ib were determined. We first used the multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method to determine the crystal structure of form Ia (Table 1, Figure 2). We next used the molecular replacement method, employing form Ia's structure as a search model, to determine the crystal structure of form Ib. The structure determination of CprB has revealed that it exists as a dimer (Figure 2B). The crystal structures of forms Ia and Ib were ° refined at 2.4 A resolution (Table 1). The Ramachandran plots of the refined crystal structures show that there are no residues that have f ­c angles in the generously allowed and disallowed regions. The final refined models of forms Ia and Ib are composed of 406 and 390 amino acid residues, respectively. The residues in the mobile regions, where no electron densities were observed (1 ­ 4 (Ia-A), 168 ­175 (Ia-A), 213­ 215 (Ia-A), 1 ­4 (Ia-B), 76­ 79 (Ia-B), 118­ 119 (Ia-B), 214 ­ 215 (Ia-B), 1 ­5 (Ib-A), 163 ­175 (Ib-A), 213 ­215 (Ib-A), 1 ­ 3 (Ib-B), 163 ­175 (Ib-B), and 213 ­215 (Ib-B) (the crystal form and the subunit are given in parentheses)), are not included in the final model. Overall structure The CprB dimer has an "V" shape with the ° ° ° dimensions of 60 A £ 50 A £ 25 A (Figure 2B). The two subunits in the dimer are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis, 1718 and 1778 rotation axes for crystal forms Ia and Ib, respectively. The subunit of CprB is composed of ten a-helices and can be divided into two domains, a DNA-binding domain (residues 1 ­ 52) and a regulatory domain (residues 77 ­215) (Figure 2B). The helices are designated numerically from the N terminus (a1 (7 ­ 25), a2

are connected by helix a4, which shows high temperature factors suggesting its mobile nature. A database search revealed that the overall structure of CprB is similar to those of the TetR family proteins, QacR,18,19 and TetR,20,21,22 suggesting that CprB belongs to the TetR family.

Residues located in the interface between the DNA-binding and the regulatory domains are marked by "i" below the sequences. Those involved in forming the ligand-binding pocket are marked by "p".

Interaction between two subunits The inter-subunit interaction of the dimer buries ° ° 1413 A2 and 983 A2 surface areas per monomer for forms Ia and Ib, respectively. Helices a8 and a9 of the two subunits are involved mainly in the intersubunit interaction. In the form Ia dimer, six direct hydrogen bonds and three water-mediated hydrogen bonds are observed between the two subunits. In addition, there is a disulfide bridge via Cys159 on helix a8 between the two subunits (Figure 2B). It should be noted that typical g-butyrolactone receptors do not have a disulfide bridge connecting the two subunits in the dimer, because the Cys residues are not conserved in other g-butyrolactone receptors (Figure 3). It remains unclear whether or not the disulfide bridge in the CprB dimer is required for its function. DNA-binding domain The DNA-binding domain is composed of three N-terminal a-helices, a1, a2, and a3. Of the three, helices a2 and a3 form a typical helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, which was predicted on the basis of its primary structure. Residues on the HTH motif are well conserved among the related proteins. In

particular, the residues on helix a3 are completely conserved among the related proteins (Figure 3). This is consistent with the finding that some gbutyrolactone receptors, such as CprA, CprB, and ArpA, so far examined recognize the same nucleotide sequence.15 Helix a1, which is located between the HTH motif and helix a6, is the interface between the DNA-binding and the regulatory domains. The hydrophobic core of the DNA-binding domain is composed of Ile14, Ile15, Ala18, Phe22, Le32, Ile35, Leu46, and Phe50, which are well conserved among the related proteins (Figure 3). In addition, Leu56 at the N-terminal part of helix a4 also participates in the formation of the hydrophobic core. The side-chain of Leu56 is plugged into the pocket formed by the hydrophobic core residues of the DNA-binding domain. The N-terminal part of helix a4 therefore seems to be essential for stabilizing the DNA-binding domain and to be strongly associated with the DNA-binding domain. Regulatory domain The regulatory domain is composed of six ahelices (helices a5 to a10). All the helices, except for helix a6, form an anti-parallel five-helix bundle.

Helix a6 is located at the bottom of the regulatory domain and is nearly orthogonal to the long axis of the regulatory domain (Figure 2B). Residues Pro101, Val102, Arg104, Ala105, Arg108, Leu109, and Val114 on helix a6 are in van der Waals contact with helix a1 of the DNA-binding domain (Figure 3). There is a large cavity in the regulatory domain, which seems to be a ligand-binding pocket (Figure 4A and B). This pocket is surrounded by helices a4, a5, a6, a7, and a8 and an N-terminal part of loop 8, and is extended in the direction of the long axis of the helix bundle. The entrance of the pocket is located at the bottom part of the regulatory domain. In subunit B of the form Ia crystal (hereafter subunit B(Ia)), loop 8 (residues 162 ­ 177) covers the entrance of the ligand-binding pocket. Loop 8 therefore seems to serve as a lid of the ligand-binding pocket. In the other subunit, how-

ever, loop 8 is not visible due to its mobile nature (see above). The dimensions of the ligand-binding pocket are ° ° approximately 20 A long by 5 A in diameter. The inner surface of the pocket is lined mainly by hydrophobic residues: Gln64, Ser68, Leu86, Leu89, Thr90, Met93, Ala94, Cys97, Leu103, Leu107, Trp127, Ile130, Ala131, Leu157, Val158, Val161, Val162, Gly163, Thr164, Glu177, and Leu181. Of these residues, Gln64, Lue86, Ala94, Trp127, Vla158, and Gly163 are well conserved among the related proteins (Figures 3 and 4). It should be noted that there are several conserved residues between the ligand-binding pocket and the DNA-binding domain (Figures 3 and 5). Residues located at the inter-domain interface (Ala19, Phe22, Asp23, and Tyr27 from helix a1, and Arg104, Ala105, Arg108, and Leu109 from helix a6) are well conserved among the related

respectively. The shifts of helices a4 and a6 and the DNA-binding domain seem to occur concomitantly. The concomitant shifts of the DNA-binding domain and helix a6 can be ascribed to van der Waals interactions between helices a1 and a6. Helix a4 is likely to be shifted concomitantly with the DNA-binding domain, because the N-terminal part of the helix is tightly associated with the DNA-binding domain (see above). Structural comparison with the TetR family proteins A database search revealed that the overall structure of CprB is similar to those of the TetR family proteins, QacR18,19 and TetR.20 ­ 22 The crystal structure of CprB is closely related to that of QacR in complex with its target DNA (PDB code 1JT0).19 Structural comparison revealed that QacR has essentially the same fold as that of CprB except for the lack of helix a10. The least-squares fitting between the QacR and the CprB dimers resulted ° in a rms deviation of 3.5 A for 271 corresponding Ca atoms. This rather large rms deviation value arises from a slight difference in the relative disposition of the regulatory and the DNA-binding domains. In fact, the regulatory domain and the DNA-binding domain of subunit A(Ia) of CprB can be superimposed on the corresponding domains of QacR (PDB code 1JT0) with rms devi° ° ations of 1.48 A (for 71 Ca atoms) and 0.78 A (for 44 Ca atoms), respectively (Figure 7A and B). Structure-based amino acid sequence alignment shows that the amino acid sequences of the DNAbinding domains of CprB and QacR have 36% identity. The residues forming a hydrophobic core of the DNA-binding domain are especially well conserved (75% identity) between the two (Figure 7C), which suggests that there is an evolutionary relationship between the DNA-binding domains of the two proteins. On the other hand, the amino acid sequences of the regulatory domains show no detectable similarities between the two proteins despite the similarity of their three-dimensional structures. It is noteworthy that the regulatory domain of QacR does not have a ligand-binding pocket. In QacR, the region corresponding to the ligand-binding pocket is filled with aromatic residues (Trp61, Tyr82, Tyr123, and Tyr127). The ligand-binding site of QacR is located at the cavity between the helix bundle and helix a6.18 We also compared the crystal structure of CprB (subunit A(Ia)) with that of TetR (PDB code 1PQI).22 The DNA-binding domains of the two proteins are very similar. The two DNA-binding domains can be superimposed with rms deviation ° of 1.56 A using 44 Ca atoms, and in this case they show amino acid sequence similarity (20% identity) (Figure 7C). On the other hand, the overall structures of the regulatory domains in the two proteins are slightly different. First of all, TetR lacks the helix corresponding to helix a10 of CprB. Secondly, CprB lacks the helix corresponding to

receptors, and six residues between the ligandbinding site and helix a6 (Gln64, Gly106 Pro123, Phe124, Trp127, and Val158) are also conserved. These conserved residues among the g-butyrolactone receptors seem to be responsible for the conformational changes upon ligand binding (see Discussion). Conformational change of the subunit Least-squares comparisons of four subunits of CprB derived from two crystal forms (subunits A(Ia), B(Ia), A(Ib), and B(Ib)) show that all the subunits except subunit B(Ia) adopt essentially the same conformation with root-mean-square (rms) ° deviations (for Ca atoms) of less than 1 A. Subunit B(Ia) shows a conformational change, however, resulting in a different relative disposition of the DNA-binding and the regulatory domains (Figure 6). In subunit B(Ia), helices a6 and a8 shift by ° approximately 2 A in the C-terminal direction of each helix. In addition, the DNA-binding domain ° ° and helix a4 shift by approximately 2 A and 1 A,

helix a9 of TetR. Despite these differences, the folds of the core parts of the regulatory domains are similar to each other. Our comparison of the two regulatory domains also revealed that the arrangement of the ligand-binding pocket of TetR is different from that of CprB. In TetR, the ligand-

binding pocket extends nearly orthogonal to the long axis of the regulatory domain, although that of CprB lies nearly parallel with the long axis of the regulatory domain. Helix a1 of CprB is longer than the corresponding helices of TetR and QacR. Helix a1 of CprB

has extra residues at the N terminus (Figure 7C). Amino acid sequence alignment shows that the long N-terminal helix is a characteristic feature of the g-butyrolactone receptors (Figure 3).

Discussion
Structure of g-butyrolactone autoregulator receptor proteins The crystal structure of CprB is the first example for the g-butyrolactone receptors that control secondary metabolism and/or morphological development in Streptomyces. The amino acid sequences of the g-butyrolactone receptors show significant similarity among them (30% to 40% identity), although deletions and insertions of the amino acid residues of the related receptors occur in the loop regions (Figure 3). We assume that the structure of CprB represents the structure of g-butyrolactone receptors. Structural similarity between CprB and the TetR family proteins suggests that gbutyrolactone receptors belong to the TetR family. As described above, the crystal structure of CprB is similar to that of QacR in complex with its target DNA.19 On the other hand, the structure of QacR in complex with its ligand18 shows significant differences in the relative disposition of the two domains due to the conformational changes upon ligand binding. The present crystal structure of CprB may resemble a DNA-binding form. DNA-binding domain To date, the crystal structures of the TetR ­ DNA22 and QacR ­ DNA19 complexes have been determined. These crystal structures have revealed that the residues interacting with their target DNA are mainly located on helix a3, which interacts with the major groove of the target DNA. On the basis of these crystal structures, the interaction between g-butyrolactone receptor and its target DNA can be predicted. In CprB, the distance between the ° two a3 helices in the dimer is approximately 40 A. The docking study between CprB and DNA shows that the arrangement of the two a3 helices seems to be suitable for interaction with the major grooves of the CprB-bound nucleotide sequence. Because the exposed residues on helix a3 of CprB (Lys43, Gly44, Ala45, Tyr47, and Phe48) are completely conserved among the related receptors (Figure 3), it is conceivable that helix a3 is responsible for the recognition of the conserved motif of the nucleotide sequence to which g-butyrolactone receptors bind. On the other hand, the exposed residues on helix a2 (Ser33, Glu34, Val36, Ala37, and His38) are less conserved than those on helix a3, suggesting that these residues may modulate the specificity for the target nucleotide sequence. It is of note that CprB and other g-butyrolactone receptors have extra residues at the N terminus, when compared with QacR and TetR (Figures 3

and 7A and C). The docking study between CprB and DNA suggests that the central part of the target DNA is recognized by the HTH motifs and the flanking regions of the target DNA are supposedly recognized by the extended N terminus of each subunit. In this binding mode, the CprB dimer can cover approximately 22 bp nucleotides. Because the length of the covered nucleotides is comparable to that of the target sequence of typical g-butyrolactone receptors (approximately 22 ­25 bp),23,24 we assume that this binding mode is a common feature of g-butyrolactone receptors. It should be noted, however, that the stoichiometry of the interaction between the g-butyrolactone receptor and the target DNA remains unknown. The biochemical and crystal structure analyses of the QacR ­ DNA complex have shown that two QacR dimers bind to the target DNA of 28 bp long.19,25 We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that two CprB dimers bind to its target DNA as found in the QacR ­DNA complex.19,25 Ligand-binding pocket The large cavity found in the regulatory domain is most likely a ligand-binding pocket. Since the ligand-binding pocket is formed by helices of one subunit, the dimeric form of the g-butyrolactone receptors has two independent ligand-binding pockets. This means that one g-butyrolactone receptor binds two ligand molecules. As described above, residues lining the inner surface of the pocket are mostly hydrophobic residues and not well conserved among the related proteins (Figures 3 and 4). These facts suggest that the ligandbinding pocket for each receptor is designed to recognize its specific ligand having a hydrophobic character. This is consistent with the observations that g-butyrolactone receptors show strict ligand specificity.8,10,26 The docking study using the crystal structure of CprB and g-butyrolactones shows that the pocket is large enough to accommodate an entire molecule of typical g-butyrolactones (Figure 1). The bound ligand is likely to be completely buried in the receptor molecule, which may partially cause the strong interaction between the ligand and its specific receptor. The docking study suggested that a g-butyrolactone molecule binds to the pocket in an extended manner and Trp127, which has been proposed to be essential for ligand binding by site-directed mutagenesis,15 causes a hydrophobic interaction with the alkyl chain of a gbutyrolactone molecule. Hydrophobic interaction between Trp127 and the alkyl chain of the ligand would stabilize the ligand binding. Since the sidechain of the Trp residue lines the inner surface of the cavity (Figure 4B), this substitution should enlarge the ligand-binding pocket. A complementary fit between the ligand-binding pocket and its specific ligand molecule seems to be important for stabilizing the ligand binding.

graphic steps, as described.17 CprB and SeCprB were crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The crystal structure of CprB in form Ia was determined by the MAD method. Analysis of the fluorescence from a form Ia crystal near the anomalous Kedge of selenium suggested that the Se atoms were indeed incorporated, and the following three wave° lengths were chosen for data collection: 0.9792 A (peak), ° ° 0.9795 A (edge), and 0.9710 A (high remote) (Table 1). The MAD data were collected using synchrotron radiation of BL41XU at SPring-8, Harima. The phase calcu° lation was carried out at 2.4 A resolution using the program SOLVE (ver. 2.0).27 The calculation using SOLVE found all the eight selenium sites. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contained two subunits of CprB. The electron density map obtained was applied to density modification by the program RESOLVE.28 Almost 75% of the molecular model was constructed using the auto-interpretation routine of the program RESOLVE. The remaining part of the model was made using the ° program XtalView.29 The model was refined at 2.4 A resolution with the programs CNS30 and REFMAC.31 After each refinement calculation, the model was corrected with difference Fourier maps using the program XtalView. Water molecules were picked by the water-add routine of XtalView. The crystal structure of CprB in form Ib was deter° mined at 2.4 A resolution by the molecular replacement method using the program AMORE32 in the CCP4 program suite.33 The structure of the CprB dimer in form Ia was used as a search model. The diffraction data of the form Ib crystal were collected using synchrotron radiation of BL6A in PF, Tsukuba. The crystallographic refinement of these crystal structures was carried out by the method used for the form Ia crystal. The results of the crystallographic refinements are summarized in Table 1.

Possible mechanism of transcriptional regulation Crystal structure analyses of the TetR family proteins have revealed the mechanism of the conformational changes upon ligand binding.18,22 Although the ligand-binding site differs between QacR and TetR, the conformational changes caused by ligand binding are similar to each other. First, the ligand binding causes the shift of helix a6, which in turn induces the relocation of helix a4 and the DNA-binding domain through van der Waals interactions between them. As a result of the relocation of the DNA-binding domain, QacR/ TetR dissociates from the promoter region of the target gene. In the case of CprB, the concomitant shifts of helices a4 and a6 and the DNA-binding domain have also been found in the present crystal structures (Figure 6). As described above, the shift of helix a6 can induce the relocation of helix a4 and the DNA-binding domain in CprB. Although the conformational changes found in subunit B(Ia) of CprB seem to be caused by crystal packing, the present crystal structures and the result of the mutational analysis of ArpA15 suggest that similar conformational changes could occur upon ligand binding. Mutational analysis of ArpA14 showed that the Pro115Ser mutant abolishes DNA-binding ability, presumably due to the relocation of the DNA-binding domain, which suggests that a conformational change around Pro115 causes the relocation of helices a4 and a6 and the DNA-binding domain as found in TetR22 and QacR.18 The crystal structure of CprB shows that Pro123, which corresponds to Pro115 of ArpA, is in van der Waals contact with Trp127. Because of possible direct interaction of Trp127 with the ligand (see above), the ligand binding would induce a conformational change of Trp127, which in turn is propagated to Pro123 and neighboring residues through van der Waals interactions. Pro123 and Trp127, together with Gln64, Phe124, and Val158 (Figure 5), form a cluster of conserved residues. All these residues except for Val158 are in van der Waals contact with the residues of helix a6. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the conformational changes of these conserved residues caused by the ligand binding induce the shift of helix a6, as a result of which helix a4 and the DNA-binding domain are relocated. Since the residues (Leu103 and Leu107) on helix a6 participate in the formation of the ligandbinding pocket, direct interactions between these residues and the bound ligand may also cause the shift of helix a6.

Structure analysis and amino acid sequence alignment The refined structures were analyzed using the program PROCHECK.34 None of the structures determined here contained any residues having dihedral angles in the "disallowed" regions of the Ramachandran plot. Least-squares comparisons of various molecular models were carried out using LSQKAB in the CCP4 program suite.33 The docking study between CprB and its target DNA in the B-form was carried out using the program QUANTA (Accelrys). The B-form DNA model was automatically generated by the routine of QUANTA. Docking between the DNA and the CprB dimer was carried out manually. An energy minimization of the CprB ­ DNA complex was not carried out in the present study. The amino acid sequence alignment of CprB and related proteins was carried out using the program ClustalX.35 The results obtained were assessed and modified manually. The amino acid sequences used for the sequence alignment were: CprB (S. coelicolor A3(2), TrEMBL:O66122), CprA (S. coelicolor A3(2), TrEMBL: O24741), AprA (S. griseus, TrEMBL: Q9ZN78), FarA (Streptomyces sp., TrEMBL: O86852), ScbR (S. coelicolor A3(2), TrEMBL: O86852), SpbR (Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, TrEMBL: Q8VVP1), and BarA (S. virginiae, TrEMBL: Q60011).
