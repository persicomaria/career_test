The crystal structures of recombinant and native b homotrimers of soybean b-conglycinin were determined Ê by X-ray crystallography at 2.7 and 2.8 A resolutions, respectively. The crystals of the recombinant and native b homotrimers belong to space group P21 with cell paraÊ Ê Ê meters a  80.51 A, b  63.48 A, c  131.43 A, and Ê b  90.018 and with cell parameters a  82.78 A, Ê , c  125.33 A and b  97.228, respectively. Ê b  69.47 A The b monomers consist of amino-terminal and carboxylterminal modules that are very similar to each other and are related by a pseudo-dyad axis. Each module of the b monomer is subdivided into a core and a loop domain. These structural features of both b homotrimers are consistent with those of canavalin and phaseolin, which

are similar vicilin class proteins. The superposition of the models of the native and recombinant b monomers shows a Ê root mean square deviation of 0.43±0.51 A for 343 Ê common Ca atoms within 2.0 A. This result indicates that the N-linked glycans do not influence the final structure of the b homotrimer. Comparison of the models of b-conglycinin, phaseolin and canavalin indicates that b-conglycinin resembles canavalin rather than phaseolin, and that canavalin and phaseolin differ the most among them. The evolutional relationships are discussed. Keywords: b-conglycinin; crystal structure; N-linked glycan; soybean; vicilin.

Soybean proteins are one of the most attractive plant food proteins for man, as they exhibit a hypocholesterolemic effect [1,2] and have good nutritional and physicochemical properties (such as gel-forming and emulsifying abilities required for food systems) [3,4]. Soybean proteins are composed of two major components, b-conglycinin (vicilin class) and glycinin (legumin class), which account for about 30% and 40% of the total seed proteins, respectively. These two components are responsible for the nutritional, physicochemical and physiological properties of soybean proteins. b-Conglycinin has a trimeric structure analogous to that of other 7S globulins [4,5] and is composed of three kinds of subunit a, a H and b. Many molecular species with different subunit compositions, including homotrimers with almost random combinations, are present in soybean seeds [6,7]. The amino-acid sequences of these subunits deduced from their nucleotide sequences indicate that the a and a H subunits contain extension regions in addition to core

regions common to all subunits, and that the core regions exhibit high absolute homologies (90.4, 76.2 and 75.5% between a and a H , a and b, and a H and b, respectively [8]). However, it is known that the contributions of individual subunits to physicochemical and physiological properties and allergenicity differ as follows: (a) the orders of thermal stabilities, which are one of the structural features related to food processing and conferred by the core regions, are b . a H . a [8]; (b) b-conglycinin mainly contributes to the up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors, which is one of the mechanisms of the hypocholesterolemic effect of soybean proteins [2,9], and only the a H subunit is responsible for the up-regulation activity of b-conglycinin [10]; (c) b-conglycinin is the third main allergen responsible for soybean allergy, and only the a subunit is identified as having a reactivity with soybean-sensitive-patients H sera [11]. In order to investigate why individual subunits of b-conglycinin have different properties as described above, it is necessary to elucidate their crystal structures by means of X-ray crystallography. Although a large amount of homogeneous homotrimers is required for X-ray crystallography, they are very difficult to obtain from natural soybean seeds because of molecular heterogeneity [6,7] and the high homologies of their amino-acid sequences [8]. Recently, a mutant soybean cultivar has been developed which contains b-conglycinin composed of only the b subunit [12]. Therefore, b homotrimers can be purified easily using the mutant soybean. Alternatively, the Escherichia coli expression systems we constructed previously are suitable for the preparation of individual homotrimers for X-ray crystallography because they

were demonstrated to have the correct secondary and quaternary structures [8]. This system yields nonglycosylated b-conglycinin, although the native form from the seeds is a glycoprotein. Using this system, we revealed that the N-linked glycans are not essential for the folding and assembly into trimers [8]. However, the effect of the carbohydrate moieties on the tertiary structure is not known. Therefore, at first, recombinant and native b homotrimers are needed for X-ray crystallography. In this paper, we crystallized recombinant and native b homotrimers and determined their three-dimensional strucÊ tures at 2.7 and 2.8 A resolutions, respectively. The overall structure of the recombinant b homotrimer is essentially identical to that of the native b homotrimer. We compared the structure of the recombinant b with those of common bean phaseolin [13] and jack bean canavalin [14,15], which are vicilin class proteins.

Data collection Diffraction data of the recombinant and native b homoÊ trimers up to 2.7 and 2.8 A, respectively, were collected Ê with CuKa radiation (l  1.5418 A) generated by a MAC Science M18XHF rotating anode generator on a Bruker HI-STAR multiwire area detector and were processed with the sadie and saint software packages (Bruker). The detector was positioned at 150 mm from the centered crystal.

Structure determination and refinement The crystal structure of the recombinant b homotrimer was solved by the molecular replacement method. x-plor [18] was used for calculation of molecular replacement and refinement with the data |F | . 2 s(F). The protein structure model of jack bean canavalin (1cav of Brookhaven Protein Data Bank) [14] was used as a search model. A cross-rotation search followed by patterson correlation (PC) refinement resulted in a cluster at the peak indicative of a single set of Eularian angles. A translation function Ê search (11±5 A) using the PC-refined solution of the rotation function yielded an outstanding peak at 13.6 s. The appropriately rotated and translated model gave an R Ê factor of 0.514 for the data between 11.0 and 4.0 A. The Ê rigid body refinement with the data between 11.0 and 4.0 A resolution led to a decrease in the R factor to 0.498. Refinement by simulated annealing with molecular dynamics using a slow-cooling protocol similar to that È described by Brunger et al. [19], from 3000 to 300 K, yielded R  0.298. The model was assigned to the correct recombinant b sequence as described in a previous paper [8] by replacing residues using the model-building program turbo-frodo (Bio-Graphics) on an INDY computer. |Fo| 2 |Fc| and 2|Fo| 2 |Fc| maps were used to locate the correct model. Several rounds of positional refinement and B factor refinement, followed by manual model building, were carried out in order to improve the model. The final R factor was 0.202 for 27452 data points with |F| . 2 s(F ) Ê in the 7.0±2.7 A resolution range. Rfree calculated for randomly separated 10% data was 0.284. The average B Ê factor of the recombinant b was 26.0 A2 for protein atoms. The crystal structure of the native b homotrimer was also solved by the molecular replacement method, using the protein structure model of the refined recombinant b homotrimer as a search model. A cross-rotation search followed by PC refinement resulted in a cluster at the peak indicative of a single set of Eularian angles. A translation Ê function search (10.0±4.0 A) using the PC-refined solution of the rotation function yielded an outstanding peak at 36.5 s. The appropriately rotated and translated model gave an R factor of 0.348 for the data between 10.0 and Ê 4.0 A. The rigid body refinement led to a decrease in the R Ê factor of 0.327 for the data between a 10.0 and 4.0 A resolution. |Fo| 2 |Fc| and 2|Fo| 2 |Fc| maps were used to locate the correct model. Several rounds of positional refinement and B factor refinement, followed by manual model building, were carried out in order to improve the model. The final R factor was 0.205 for 20997 data points Ê with |F| . 2 s(F) in the 7.0±2.8 A resolution range and Rfree calculated for randomly separated 10% data was

Preparation of recombinant and native b-conglycinin b homotrimers The recombinant b homotrimer was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and was purified as described in a previous paper [8]. The native b homotrimer from the mutant soybean was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (70±85% saturation) from a so-called glycinin-rich fraction prepared according to the method of Nagano et al. [16] because it is known that it behaves like glycinin at acid precipitation during the purification procedure [17]. Crystallization The recombinant and native b homotrimers were subjected to crystallization using a hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The solutions of the crystallization droplets of the recombinant b homotrimer were prepared by mixing 5 mL protein solutions (10 mg´mL21 in 100 mm Mes, pH 5.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% NaN3) with bottom solutions (7% polyethyleneglycol 10 000, 100 mm Mes, pH 5.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% NaN3). On the other hand, those of the native b homotrimer were prepared by mixing 5 mL protein solutions (5 mg´mL21 in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.8, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ( p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% NaN3) with bottom solutions (5% polyethyleneglycol 6000, 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.8, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ( p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% NaN3). The droplets of both the recombinant and native b homotrimers were equilibrated with 500 mL of the bottom solutions at 4 8C. The crystals of the recombinant b homotrimer belonged Ê to space group P21 with cell parameters a  80.51 A, Ê Ê b  63.48 A, c  131.43 A, and b  90.018. Those of the native b homotrimer belonged to space group P21 with cell Ê Ê Ê parameters a  82.78 A, b  69.47 A, c  125.33 A and b  97.228.

0.275. The average B factor of the native b homotrimer was Ê 25.6 A2 for protein atoms. Accessible surface area estimation Accessible surface area (ASA) was estimated with the program naccess [20], which implements the algorithm of Lee and Richards [21]. ASA was determined with a Ê spherical probe with a radius of 1.4 A. ASAs in the interfaces between modules and between monomers were indicated as the average values in all combinations of monomer±monomer and of module±module, respectively. Isolation and sequencing of genomic DNA Genomic DNA was prepared from young leaves using the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method [22] with some modifications. Young leaves were frozen, ground into fine powder with a pestle, and then suspended in 2 Â CTAB buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm EDTA, 1.4 m NaCl, 2% CTAB, 1% (w/w) polyvinylpyrrolidone). The suspension was lysed at 55 8C for 15 min and then extracted twice with an equal volume of chloroform : isoamyl alcohol (24 : 1). Ten per cent CTAB buffer (10% CTAB, 0.7 m NaCl), 0.1 vol., was added to the aqueous phase and an equal volume of the precipitate buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 1% CTAB) was added. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 1 m NaCl-TE (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) at 55 8C. Genomic DNA was further purified by ethanol precipitation and RNase digestion and was used as a template to amplify the b-subunit gene. The b-subunit gene was amplified using a primer 1 (CTATGATGAGAGTGCGGTTTCC corresponding to a signal peptide) and a primer 2 (CGGGGTACCACAAAACACAAGCATCGTAT corresponding to the complementary sequence of a 3 H -end noncoding region) by PCR.

Qualities of the final models of the recombinant and native b homotrimers The final statistics for the refinements of the recombinant and native b homotrimer models together with the statistics for the data collection are shown in Table 1. We designated the three monomers as A, B and C in the Protein Data Bank. The final models of the recombinant b monomers A, B and C contain 368, 364 and 379 residues, respectively, and those of the native ones contain 357, 362 and 368 residues, respectively. In all monomers of the recombinant and native b, the N-terminal (the residues 1±7, 1±8, 1±2 and 1±7 of the recombinant A, B, C and all native monomers, respectively) and C-terminal (the residues 393± 416 of all the recombinant and native monomers) are not included in the final models. Furthermore, two regions are not included in most monomers. One of them is the region of the residues 175±182. In the case of the recombinant monomers, the residues 175±182 are not included in the models of the recombinant monomers A and B, although the model of the recombinant monomer C contains this region completely. In the case of the native monomers, the regions of the residues 176±181 and 192±201, 175±184 and 177±179 are not included in the models of the monomers A, B and C, respectively. It is believed that the model of the native b contains fewer residues in this region than that of the recombinant b because it has a lower resolution than the model of the recombinant b. The other region is within residues 290±301. In the case of the

The three monomers in the recombinant and native b homotrimers are shown in light blue, light green and pink, and blue, green and magenta, respectively. The carbohydrate moieties of the native b homotrimer are shown in yellow as a ball and stick model. The views in (A) and (C) are depicted as threefold symmetry axis runs perpendicular to the paper and the depictions in (B) and (D) are related to the view depicted in (A) and (C) by rotation of 908.

recombinant, the regions of the residues 292±300, 291±301 and 290±300 are not included in the models of the monomers A, B and C, respectively. On the other hand, in the case of the native, the regions of the residues 290±301, 290±301 and 289±302 are not included in the models of the monomers A, B and C, respectively. 2|Fo| 2 |Fc| and |Fo| 2 |Fc| maps in these regions became too thin to trace the correct sequence. Most residues located in these regions are hydrophilic and probably located on the surface. The locations of these regions in the overall structure are described in detail below. Because of the low resolutions, no water molecule is included in the models of the recombinant and native b homotrimers. Ramachandran plots [23] of main chain torsion angles show that 99% of the residues of both b homotrimers lie within allowed regions as defined by the program procheck [24]. Overall structures of the recombinant and native b homotrimers Figure 1 shows the ribbon models of the recombinant and native b homotrimers. Overall structures are almost consistent with those of canavalin and phaseolin [13±15]. Outside diameters of both homotrimers are about

Ê Ê Ê 96 A Â 96 A, and the thicknesses are about 44 A. A monomer consists of amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal modules which are very similar to each other and are pseudo-dyad-related. Each module of the monomer is subdivided into a core (N-terminal, the residues 12±139 and 187±189; C-terminal, the residues 217±349 and 389±391) and a loop domain (N-terminal, the residues 149±172; C-terminal, the residues 358±383). Core domains consist of the b barrels and the helices between strands A and B (Fig. 2). In addition to these structural elements, N-terminal and C-terminal modules contain the C-terminal and N-terminal strand Z, respectively. The loop domain contains several a helices, protruding from either side of the monomer as a pair of hooks. Both b barrels contain a prominent b bulge symmetrically at Pro residues 64 and 264. There are four major regions containing N- and C-termini that are not included in the final models. Two regions other than N- and C-termini are the residues 175±182 and 290±301. The region of residues 175±182 is located between the helix 3 and the strand J H in the N-terminal module. The region of residues 290±301 is located in the loop between the strands E and F in the C-terminal module.

To calculate the decrease in surface area caused by the N-terminal and C-terminal module interaction, the ASA of the monomer was subtracted from the total ASA of the N-terminal and C-terminal modules. Interactions between Ê the modules resulted in a decrease of 1473 A2 in surface areas of both the N-terminal and C-terminal modules, which corresponded to around 14.1% and 14.6% of the ASAs of N-terminal and C-terminal modules, respectively. Nonpolar groups occupied around 70% of the buried surface areas between the N-terminal and C-terminal modules, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are important for monomer formation. The hydrophobic residues constituting the interface between the two modules of each monomer in the recombinant b are presented in Table 2 because of the fact that recombinant b has a higher resolution than the native b. Most of these residues are found in the ZA H ABDEFGI sheets of the b barrels and the helices between strands A and B in the core domain. In addition to a hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges are present (Table 2). Most of the residues contributing to hydrogen bonds are present in the regions near the strands Z and G. Interaction between the monomers The extent of monomer±monomer interactions contributes to the stability of an oligomeric protein by decreasing its ASA. To calculate the decrease in surface area caused by trimerization, the ASA of the trimer was subtracted from the total ASA of the three monomers. In the recombinant b Ê monomer, 4992 A2 of the ASA are buried by the trimerization, corresponding to 26.9% of the ASA of a monomer. Nonpolar groups occupy around 65% of the buried surface areas between the monomers, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are important for trimerization. The hydrophobic residues constituting the interface between the monomers are presented in Table 3. They arise not only from the a helices but also from the b barrel. In addition to a hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge are present (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Heterogeneity of the native b The resolution of the recombinant b was somewhat higher than that of the native b (Table 1). Multiple isomeric forms of the b subunit exist in a dry soybean seed [25]. Thus, it is likely that the difference in resolution between the recombinant and native b is due to the presence of isoforms in the native b. It has been suggested that post-translational modification was responsible for the charge heterogeneity [25]. However, in the electron density map of the native b, there is no precise portion indicating the occurrence of posttranslational modification except N-glycosylation. The charge heterogeneity may exist in regions that were not

homotrimer. On the other hand, a sequencing study revealed that Phe13 and Phe174 in the recombinant b from cDNA prepared from the developing seeds of soybean var. Wasesuzunari are replaced by Leu in the native b deduced from the genomic DNA sequence from a mutant soybean. In the recombinant b, Phe13 and Phe174 exist in the strand Z and the loop following the helix 3, respectively (Fig. 2). The structures of the regions including the replacing sites of the recombinant b are equal to those of the native b from the mutant soybean (Fig. 3). Five intramonomer salt bridges (Asp70±Arg102, Lys121±Glu313, Lys121±Asp314, Arg220±Asp255 and

included in the model or it may not be clear in the electron density map because of low resolution. If the latter is the reason, higher resolution X-ray analysis may shed light on the positions and varieties of post-translational modification. Disordered regions Four major regions including N- and C-termini were not included in the models of all recombinant and native b monomers because electron density maps in these regions became too thin to trace the correct sequence. A series of experiments carried out using fresh protein solution and dissolved crystals clearly showed that proteolysis did not occur during crystallization, although we cannot exclude the possibility that a small portion of the C-terminal was deleted. Thus, these results indicate that the regions that were not included in the final models are likely to be disordered. N- and C-termini are also disordered in models of common bean phaseolin [13] and jack bean canavalin [14,15]. The major disordered regions, other than N- and C-termini, are the loop between the helix 3 and the strand J H in N-terminal module and the loop between the strands E and F in the C-terminal module. The regions corresponding to the loop between the helix 3 and the strand J H in N-terminal module in canavalin and phaseolin [13±15] are shorter than that of b, and the models of both canavalin and phaseolin also do not include the regions corresponding to the loop between the strands E and F in the C-terminal module (Fig. 4). Wright aligned amino-acid sequences in order to maximize the homology among vicilin proteins and suggested five variable regions [26]. The disordered regions in b are almost consistent with the variable regions determined by Wright. The disordered regions in the Nand C-termini correspond to variable regions I and V, respectively, and those in the loop between the helix 3 and the strand J H and that between the strands E and F in the C-module correspond to variable regions III and IV, respectively. These results indicate that they probably protrude into the solvent and are not important for the final structure. Variable region II determined by Wright is visible in b, canavalin and phaseolin and is located in the vicinity of the N-terminal strand G. Wright identified this region as the variable region because the nucleotide sequence of the a H subunit reported by Doyle et al. [27] contained a duplication sequence in the vicinity of the N-terminal strand G. However, we demonstrated that the a H subunit of all varieties examined does not have a duplication [8]. Interactions between modules and between monomers The three-dimensional structure of the b-conglycinin b homotrimer was compared with those of phaseolin (PDB accession no. 2phl) [13] and canavalin (PDB entry 2cav) [15]. We used the model of the recombinant b for the comparison because it has a higher resolution than that of the native b. The important residues for the interactions between modules and between monomers in the three proteins are shown in Fig. 4. Most of the residues contributing to the hydrophobic interaction between modules and between monomers are conserved in the three proteins (Fig. 4). Most of the residues between modules exist on the

strands Z, B, D and I, and helix 0. On the other hand, most of the conserved residues between monomers exist on the strands C, J and J H and the helices 1, 2 and 3. Further, the corresponding residues of other vicilin class proteins are also mainly hydrophobic. Therefore, these residues are probably important for the interactions between modules and between monomers in vicilin class proteins. In addition to hydrophobic interactions, strand Z in the N-terminal module and strand G in the C-terminal module are very important for module interactions through hydrogen bonds in vicilin class proteins because these regions are conserved in vicilin class proteins. On the other hand, one salt bridge in the C-module is conserved in the three proteins. This salt bridge probably exists in many vicilin class proteins because the residues Glu235 and Arg347 (the b numbering is used) are conserved in many vicilin class proteins. Comparison of overall structures The structural similarity of the three molecules was investigated by using the a-carbon coordinates. In all comparisons between homotrimers (Fig. 5A), between monomers (Fig. 5B) and between modules (Fig. 5C), it was clearly evident that b resembles canavalin rather than phaseolin, and that canavalin and phaseolin are the most different. Identities of the primary sequences between two of the three proteins are: 43% for b and canavalin; 39% for b and phaseolin; and 28% for canavalin and phaseolin. The extent of the difference in the rmsd is consistent with that of the sequence identities. The rmsds for the entire comparable Ca atoms within Ê 2.0 A between homotrimers of canavalin and b and Ê between their monomers are 0.82 and 0.76 A, respectively (Fig. 5A and B). Therefore, the rmsd between monomers is Ê 0.06 A smaller than that between homotrimers. The rmsd between N-terminal modules and between C-terminal Ê modules was 0.12 and 0.13 A smaller than those between monomers, respectively (Fig. 5B and C). There are also similar tendencies in comparisons between models of canavalin and phaseolin and between those of phaseolin and b. These indicate that the configurations of monomers in a trimer and those of modules in a monomer are somewhat different among the three proteins. The rmsds between N-terminal modules of b and canavalin and between C-terminal modules of b and canavalin are smaller than those between the N-terminal module of b and the C-terminal module of canavalin or between the C-terminal module of b and the N-terminal module of canavalin (Fig. 5C). Further, this tendency is also observed in comparisons between modules of b and phaseolin and between those of phaseolin and canavalin (Fig. 5C). These support the proposal by Shutov et al. [28] that the evolution of vicilin class ancestors after module duplication would have occurred prior to the divergence of individual beans. Recently, our group revealed the three-dimensional structure of the soybean proglycinin, which is a member of legumin class proteins, and demonstrated that the structure of the proglycinin is very similar to those of vicilin class proteins [29]. Comparisons between homotrimers (Fig. 5A) and between monomers (Fig. 5B) clearly indicate that the structural similarities between the vicilin class proteins are greater than those between the vicilin class proteins and

proglycinin. Comparison between modules of the vicilin class proteins indicates that the structural similarity between the N- and N-modules and between C- and C-modules is greater than that between N- and C-modules as described above. However, when the modules of vicilin class proteins and those of proglycinin are compared, there is no similar pattern. Further, all comparisons between homotrimers (Fig. 5A), between monomers (Fig. 5B) and between modules (Fig. 5C) indicate that proglycinin is not most similar to b among the three vicilin proteins. These results suggest that legumin and vicilin class ancestors which had diverged from the common duplicated ancestor proteins evolved into the recent legumin and vicilin class proteins prior to the divergence of individual legumes. This is also consistent with the proposal by Shutov et al. [28].
