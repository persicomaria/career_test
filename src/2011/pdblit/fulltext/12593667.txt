Two X-ray structures of the GluR2 ligand-binding core in complex with (S)-2-amino-3-(5-tertbutyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid ((S)-ATPA) have been determined with and without Zn2+ ions. (S)-ATPA induces a domain closure of ca. 21° compared to the apo form. The tertbutyl moiety of (S)-ATPA is buried in a partially hydrophobic pocket and forces the ligand into the glutamate-like binding mode. The structures provide new insight into the molecular basis of agonist selectivity between AMPA and kainate receptors.
Introduction Glutamate receptors are abundant in the central nervous system and play a crucial role in normal brain function as well as for the mechanisms underlying various neurological and probably psychiatric disorders. The ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are divided into 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA), kainate, and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, where the subunits GluR1-GluR4 form the AMPA receptors and the subunits GluR5GluR7 and KA1-KA2 the kainate receptors.1 The iGluRs are tetrameric complexes comprised of dimers-of-dimers,2 see Figure 1a. A soluble form of the ligand-binding core of GluR2 (GluR2-S1S2J), created by substitution of the transmembrane regions M1 and M2 by a peptide linker and exclusion of the amino-terminal domain and M3, shows pharmacological profiles comparable with that of the full-length membrane-bound receptor.3-6 Subsequently, high-resolution X-ray structures of S1S2J in complex with different agonists and one antagonist have revealed different degrees of closure of the cleft between the two domains forming the ligandbinding core.2,6,7 The increasing understanding of the molecular diversity underlying the iGluR system has challenged the development of subtype selective ligands, and in this respect AMPA analogues have been studied extensively.1 Systematic replacement of the isoxazole 5-substituent combined with electrophysiology experiments at recombinant receptors implies that the moiety at the 5-position drastically influences the selectivity between AMPA and kainate receptors.8 AMPA only activates some kainate receptors and only at high concentrations, while the 5-tert-butyl derivative, (S)-2-amino-3-(5-tertbutyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid ((S)-ATPA, Figure 1b), activates GluR5 receptors with more than 50-fold higher potency than the AMPA receptors.9 To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the selectivity of (S)-ATPA between AMPA and kainate receptors, we have obtained two high-resolution X-ray structures of the GluR2-S1S2J in complex with this

ligand in the presence and absence of Zn2+ ions, respectively. Results and Discussion The correct folding of the GluR2-S1S2J protein was determined pharmacologically by saturation binding of [3H]AMPA and by competitive displacement of the [3H]AMPA binding using (S)-ATPA. The binding affinity for AMPA (Kd is 10.9 ( 4.2 nM and Bmax is 0.68 ( 0.06 pmol) and the IC50 value for (S)-ATPA were found to be in good agreement with AMPA receptor pharmacology9,10 (Figure 2). The structure of GluR2-S1S2J in complex with the agonist (S)-ATPA was determined in the presence and absence of Zn2+ ions. The structures contain one (denoted MolA, zinc form) and two molecules (denoted MolB and MolC, zinc free form) in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Pairwise superpositions of the CR-atoms of the three molecules yield root-mean square deviations of 0.34-0.36 Å. The presence of two Zn2+ ions in the zinc form only to a minor extent

influences the structure of GluR2-S1S2J in agreement with results recently reported of an agonist complex.11 Interactions between (S)-ATPA and the GluR2S1S2J Ligand-Binding Site. The same binding mode of (S)-ATPA is revealed in the two GluR2-S1S2J X-ray structures presented. (S)-ATPA interacts with the ligandbinding site of GluR2 by an extensive number of direct contacts. The interactions are very similar in all three molecules (Table 2: MolA-C, Figure 3). The R-carboxylate group of the glutamate backbone interacts through a total of four potential hydrogen bonds/ion pairs to Thr480, Arg485, and Ser645. A tetrahedral arrangement is established to the R-ammonium group of the ligands via hydrogen bonds to Pro478, Thr480, and Glu705. The interactions between the R-carboxylate and R-ammonium groups of the ligand and the binding site are similar to those of the previously described agonist complexes.6,7

In the GluR2-S1S2J structures, the hydroxyl group at the isoxazole ring occupies a position similar to that occupied by one of the oxygen atoms of the -carboxylate moiety in the (S)-glutamate complex.6 The hydroxyl group binds to D2 via two direct hydrogen bonds to Thr655, as well as indirectly through a water molecule (W1, Table 2 and Figure 3a). The water molecule W1 makes further hydrogen bonds to the oxygen atom of Leu650 and to the backbone nitrogen of Lys656. The isoxazole moiety in (S)-ATPA is situated considerably closer to D2 (distance between hydroxyl group and Thr655 CR is ca. 3.8 Å) compared to the isoxazole moiety in (S)-AMPA (ca. 4.5 Å) and the interactions of (S)-ATPA thereby resembles the (S)-glutamate mode of interaction and not the (S)-AMPA mode (Figure 3).6 The interaction with D2 is further stabilized by two hydrogen bonds between the isoxazole ring-nitrogen atom and Thr655 and a water molecule (W2), enabling indirect contact to Thr649, Leu650, Tyr702, and Leu703. The tert-butyl moiety in the 5-position of (S)-ATPA points toward a partly hydrophobic pocket7 and makes van der Waals interactions with Glu402 (closest contact to O 1), Tyr450 (O), and Pro478 (C) in D1 and to Leu650 (C2), Thr686 (O1), Glu705 (O 2), Met708 (C ), and Tyr732 (O) in D2 (Table 3). It is evident from the shape of the partially hydrophobic cavity encompassing the tert-butyl moiety that bulky substituents at the 5-position cannot be accommodated if the ligand binds in the (S)-AMPA mode. As a result, the isoxazolol hydroxy group displaces the water molecule that forms the tight association between the isoxazolol hydroxy group in (S)-AMPA and the protein.6 In addition, ligands might also interfere with Leu650 and the Glu402Thr686 interdomain interaction to various degrees depending on the size and bulkiness of the substituent. As for the agonist complex structures solved to date,6,7 this interdomain lock is maintained in the two (S)-ATPA structures. Implications for Receptor Subunit Selectivity. (S)-ATPA is the most commonly used selective GluR5 agonist, with a 20-50-fold higher potency for GluR5 than for the AMPA receptors,9 implying that the bulky tert-butyl group is well accommodated by the ligandbinding site of GluR5. Eight amino acid residues are involved in van der Waals interactions to the tert-butyl

group (Table 3) of which Leu650, Thr686, and Met708 are replaced by the smaller amino acids Val(685), Ser(721), and Ser(741), respectively, in GluR5. Results from mutagenesis studies performed on GluR1 show that Ser741 in GluR5 is the main determinant for the selective profile of ATPA.12 In accordance, we observe that the side chain of Met708 is reoriented further away from (S)-ATPA compared to the (S)-glutamate or (S)AMPA structures (Figure 3b,c). Modeling studies suggest that the hydroxyl group of a serine at position 708 might, even in the presence of the tert-butyl group, form

an indirect hydrogen bond to Tyr405 through a water molecule and thereby stabilizes the domain closure by formation of an additional interdomain interaction between D1 and D2. Additional selectivity also might be imposed by the interaction between Leu650 and the ring-oxygen atom in the isoxazole ring. Domain Closure and Dimerization of GluR2S1S2J. The agonist (S)-ATPA introduces ca. 21° domain closure (MolA: 21.4°, MolB: 21.7°, and MolC: 21.2°) relative to the apo structure of GluR2-S1S2J (PDB idcode: 1FTO, molecule A). It has been shown that the domains of the ligand-binding core close upon agonist binding,2,6,7 and the degree of closure observed for (S)ATPA is similar to that of (S)-glutamate and (S)-AMPA. As in the structure of (S)-AMPA, the trans peptide bond between Asp651 and Ser652 has flipped approximately 180° compared to the apo structure of GluR2-S1S2J. In both (S)-ATPA structures, 2-fold dimers with interface accessible surface areas of 875 and 889 Å2 per monomer for the zinc free and zinc-containing structures, respectively, are formed and the dimer interfaces are similar to those previously reported.2,6,7 Conclusion High-resolution X-ray structures have been determined of the GluR2 ligand-binding core S1S2J in complex with the isoxazolol-containing agonist (S)ATPA in the presence and absence of Zn2+ ions. The detailed information on the interactions of (S)-ATPA with the receptor has increased our understanding of the selectivity between AMPA and kainate receptors and furthermore will facilitate the design of new, subunit-selective ligands. Experimental Section
Materials. (S)-ATPA was synthesized and resolved as described9 and kindly provided by colleagues from the Department of Medicinal Chemistry. AMPA was a gift from P. Krogsgaard-Larsen, and the general chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Expression and Purification. The GluR2-S1S2J construct developed by Armstrong et al.6 was used, and the protein was expressed, refolded, and purified essentially as reported.4,13

Brief Articles [3H]AMPA Binding. Ligand binding was performed as previously described.4 For saturation binding, triplets of refolded GluR2-S1S2J protein (0.08 mg/mL) was incubated for 1 h on ice with 1-200 nM [3H]AMPA (11.1 Ci/mmol, NEN Boston) in binding buffer (100 mM thiocyanate, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2) to a total volume of 500 µL. Competition experiments were employed under similar conditions, using 20 nM [3H]AMPA and 2 nM-5 mM (S)-ATPA. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 mM glutamate. Crystallization. GluR2-S1S2J in complex with (S)-ATPA was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 6 °C. The protein complex solution contained 8 mg/mL GluR2-S1S2J and 1.4 mg/mL (S)-ATPA (molar ratio 1:25) in 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 20 mM sodium chloride, and 1 mM EDTA. Crystals were obtained in drops consisting of 1 µL complex solution and 1 µL reservoir solution of 0.1 M zinc acetate, 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 5.5, and 20% PEG 8000. The reservoir volume was 0.5 mL. The crystals grew within one week to a maximum dimension of 0.1 mm. In general, crystals without Zn2+ ions were obtained as described above, but by using a reservoir solution of 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.6, and 18% PEG 8000. Data Collection. The data of GluR2-S1S2J in complex with (S)-ATPA were collected on beamline I711 at MAX Lab, Lund, at 100 K using a MAR345 image plate detector and wavelength of 1.0760 Å for the zinc free crystal form and 1.0232 Å for the zinc-containing crystal form, respectively. The crystals were transferred to a cryo-solution containing 15% glycerol, the ligand, and reservoir solution for a few seconds prior to flashcooling. A full data set of the zinc free form was collected to 1.90 Å resolution and of the zinc form to 1.85 Å as two different data sets: A low- and a high-resolution set. The low-resolution data set was collected in resolution range 20.0-3.2 Å, whereas the high-resolution data set was covering data from 20.0 to 1.85 Å. All data were autoindexed and processed with the HKL programs DENZO and SCALEPACK.14 For crystal data and data collection statistics, see Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinements. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement, using the program AMoRe15 from CCP4.16 The structure of GluR2-S1S2J in complex with the ligand (S)-thio-ATPA (Lunn et al., to be published) was used as search model for phasing the data of the zinc-containing form, including protein atoms only. The structure of the zinc free form was solved using the structure of the zinc form as search model (protein atoms only), resulting in two clear solutions. Initially, the amino acid residues were traced using ARP/wARP17 except for a few amino acids, which were manually built using program O.18 In addition, the ligand was unambiguously fitted into the electron densities. The structure was further subjected to refinements in CNS,19 each step comprising positional and B-factor refinements. Between each refinement step, the structures were inspected and corrected using program O. Gradually, water molecules, as well as Zn2+, Cl-, and sulfate ions, were added to the structures. The structures comprise amino acid residues 393506 from segment S1 of the membrane-bound receptor, a two amino acid linker Gly-Thr, and residues 632-773 from segment S2. A summary of the structure refinements is presented in Table 1. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (ID codes 1NNK and 1NNP). The HINGEFIND script20 implemented in the programVMD21 was employed for analysis of ligand-induced domain closure. The interface-accessible surface areas were generated by the Protein Interaction Server.22 Figures were prepared with Molscript23 and Raster3d.24
