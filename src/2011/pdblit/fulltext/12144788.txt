It is commonly believed that incompatible plasmids carrying the same replicon cannot coexist stably in one Escherichia coli cell. However, we found that two incompatible plasmids carrying different antibiotic resistance genes, if under the selection pressure of the two antibiotics, can coexist in E. coli for at least 14 h, which is adequate for routine culture and protein expression. Based on this discovery, we developed a new method to coexpress foreign proteins in E. coli using two incompatible plasmids. The coding regions of the two subunits (DFF45 and DFF40) of the human DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) were cloned into two incompatible bacterial expression vectors--pET-21a with ampicillin resistance and pET-28a with kanamycin resistance, respectively. The two resulting plasmids were used to cotransform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. After selection by ampicillin and kanamycin simultaneously, cotransformants that contain both recombinant plasmids were obtained. Induced by isopropyl D-thiogalactoside, DFF45, and DFF40 were coexpressed efficiently in the presence of the two antibiotics. The coexpression product contained adequate soluble portions for both DFF45 and DFF40, while all DFF40 was insoluble if expressed alone. The coexpression product also exhibited the same caspase-activated DNase activity as its natural counterparts, which cannot be obtained if its two subunits are expressed separately. 2001 Academic Press

compete against each other during replication and subsequent partition into daughter cells, small differences will lead to more severe imbalances in the copy numbers of the two plasmids. Over the course of a few generations of bacterial growth, the minority plasmid will be completely eliminated and the descendants of the original cell will contain one plasmid or the other, but not both (2). However, the above viewpoint has not taken into account the effect of selection pressure (such as antibiotics) on the copy numbers of plasmids. Although when two incompatible plasmids carrying different antibiotic resistance genes are introduced into the same cell, differences in plasmid replication and partition will still exist, which may lead to ultimate loss of one plasmid as well, yet if the culture medium contains the two corresponding antibiotics, daughter bacteria that lose either of the two plasmids will lose the antibiotic resistance carried by that plasmid, and as a result, will be killed by the corresponding antibiotic. Therefore, after generations of growth, most of the cells that live on should still contain both plasmids, and genes that are cloned into the two plasmids can also be expressed simultaneously. To testify the above hypothesis, we used such two incompatible plasmids to coexpress the two subunits (DFF45 and DFF40) of the human DNA fragmentation factor (DFF)2 in E. coli. DFF plays a critical role in the execution and regulation of apoptosis and is responsible for the apoptosisspecific fragmentation of chromosomal DNA into oligonucleosomal units (which is named DNA ladder) (3). DFF is composed of two subunits, DFF45 and DFF40, with molecular weights of 45 and 40 kDa, respectively.

DFF40 carries the apoptosis-specific DNA endonuclease activity while DFF45 is its specific inhibitor. In living cells, DFF45 binds to DFF40 to inhibit its DNase activity. During apoptosis, DFF45 is cleaved by activated caspase-3, releasing active DFF40, which subsequently degrades chromosomal DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments (4­6). Further experiments show that DFF45 also has specific chaperone-like activity and is necessary for the production of functional DFF40 (7­9). When DFF40 is expressed alone in bacteria or insect cells, the recombinant protein aggregates and exhibits no detectable DNase activity. Coexpression of DFF45 and DFF40 significantly increased the amount of soluble DFF40 and correspondingly increases its nuclease activity (6, 10). In this report, after cloning the coding regions of DFF45 and DFF40 into two incompatible plasmids carrying different antibiotic resistance genes, we coexpressed DFF45 and DFF40 in E. coli at high levels and obtained considerable amount of soluble DFF40 with natural caspase-activated DNase activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Plasmids pET-21a( ) and pET-28a( ) were purchased from Novagen. Host strains E. coli DH5 and BL21(DE3), total RNA isolation reagent Trizol, and AMV reverse transcriptase were purchased from Life Technology Limited. Pfu DNA polymerase, restriction endonucleases, and Western blue stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Promega. High pure PCR product purification kit and rapid DNA ligation kit were purchase from Boehringer Mannheim. Mouse polyclonal antibody against DFF40 was a gift from Dr. X. Wang from U.T. Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (Dallas, TX). Caspase-3 was kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Wu from IDUN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Construction of Recombinant Plasmids Construction of expression plasmids is outlined in Fig. 1. Recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described (2). The coding regions of human DFF40 and DFF45 were amplified from total RNA of HeLa cells by RT-PCR. Primers used for each construct were Primer I (5 -CTAGAATTCATGGAGGTGACCGG-3 ) and Primer II (5 -AATGTCGACCTATGTGGGATCCTG-3 ) for DFF45; Primer III (5 -GAAGATCTATG CTCCAGAAGCCC-3 ) and Primer IV (5 -GCGTCGACTCACTGGCGTTTCCGC-3 ) for DFF40. The cDNA fragment of DFF40 was digested with BglII and SalI and inserted between BamHI and SalI sites in pET28a( ), and the resulting plasmid was designated pET28a­DFF40. The cDNA fragment of DFF45 was

digested with EcoRI and SalI and inserted into pET28a( ) between the same two sites, generating plasmid pET28a­DFF45. pET28a­DFF45 was then digested with XbaI and SalI and the 1-kb DNA fragment encoding the ribosome-binding site and DFF45 was ligated into pET-21a( ), which was digested with the same enzymes. The recombinant plasmid was designated pET21a­DFF45. Cotransformation Host strains E. coli DH5 and BL21(DE3) were made competent as described (2). Equal amounts of pET28a­ DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45 were used to cotransform E. coli BL21(DE3). The transformed competent cells were spread on LB agar plates containing 30 g/ml kanamycin (selection for pET28a­DFF40) and 100 g/ ml ampicillin (selection for pET21a­DFF45). Effect of Antibiotic Pressure on Coexistence of pET28a­DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45 in E. coli Colonies were picked from plates containing fresh cotransformed cells and cultured in liquid LB medium containing 30 g/ml kanamycin and 50 g/ml ampicillin at 37 C. At the indicated time points, certain amount of culture was appropriately diluted and divided into two aliquots, one spread on LB agar plates containing 30 g/ml kanamycin and 100 g/ml ampicillin, and the other on plates without antibiotics. After growing for 12 h at 37 C, the colonies on each plates were counted. The ratio of colonies growing on plates with two antibiotics to those on plates without antibiotics represents the proportion of E. coli cells carrying both plasmids to total E. coli cells at the time when the sample was taken. Cotransformants were also inoculated into liquid LB medium without antibiotics as control. Plating was done on the two kinds of plates in the same way as described above, and the colonies were also counted. Coexpression Cells carrying both pET28a­DFF40 and pET21a­ DFF45 were grown in liquid LB medium containing 30 g/ml kanamycin and 50 g/ml ampicillin at 37 C. Protein expression was induced at OD600 0.5 by adding isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM. After continuous shaking for another 4 h, 1 ml culture was pelleted by centrifugation and total cell proteins were analyzed by SDS­ PAGE. The remainder of culture was harvested by centrifugation and frozen at 70 C. SDS­PAGE was performed as described (2). Protein bands were stained with Coomassie blue.

Solubility Analysis of Recombinant Products Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in buffer A (10 mM Hepes­KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT). Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 min at 4 C. Both soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by SDS­PAGE. The samples were visualized by Coomassie blue and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis The samples were subjected to SDS­PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation with mouse polyclonal antibody against DFF40, the proteins were detected by alkaline phosphataseconjugated secondary antibody and visualized by Western blue stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase. In Vitro Nuclease Activity of Recombinant DFF Mouse liver nuclei were prepared as described (11). Five micrograms of soluble proteins of E. coli cells was incubated with 100 ng of recombinant caspase-3 and 106 mouse liver nuclei in a final volume of 50 l adjusted with buffer B (buffer A containing 20% glycerol and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation at 37 C for 2 h, 450 l buffer C (0.1 M Tris­HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.2% w/v SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml protease K) was added to each reaction and incubated overnight at 37 C. Subsequently, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1.5 M, and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA in the supernatant was precipitated with equal volume of 100% ethanol. The DNA precipitate was washed once with 70% (v/v) ethanol and resuspended in 20 l buffer D (10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 200 g/ml RNase A). After incubation at 37 C for 2 h, the DNA was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis (3). RESULTS Construction of Recombinant Plasmids The human DFF40 cDNA was amplified from total RNA of HeLa cells by RT-PCR. A 1-kb DNA fragment was obtained and cloned into a kanamycin-resistant bacterial expression vector pET-28a( ), generating pET28a­DFF40. The cDNA of DFF45 was amplified and cloned into pET-28a( ) in the same way, generating pET28a­DFF45. In order to introduce different antibiotic resistance into the expression vectors of DFF40 and DFF45, the coding region of DFF45 together with the ribosome-binding site sequence were transferred from pET28a­DFF45 to another bacteria expression vector pET-21a( ), which encodes an ampicillin resistance gene. The resulting plasmid was designated

pET21a­DFF45. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cotransformation of E. coli BL21(DE3) with pET28a­DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45 Because pET-28a( ) and pET-21a( ) have the same ColE1/pMB1 replicon, their derivatives pET28a­ DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45 belong to the same incompatibility group. When one E. coli cell containing two incompatible plasmids is cultured without selection pressure, one of the two plasmids is prone to loss. So we hope to maintain them in the same E. coli cell by taking advantage of different selective markers­ antibiotic resistance. Since pET28a­DFF45 is resistant to kanamycin while pET21a­DFF40 carries ampicillin resistance, we cotransformed E. coli BL21(DE3) with pET28a­DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45 and select the cotransformants using kanamycin and ampicillin simultaneously. As can be expected, the transformation yield ( 104 ­105colonies/ g of supercoiled plasmid DNA) was low under such stringent selection pressure, but enough colonies were still obtained to perform further experiments. If we transform E. coli BL21(DE3) with pET28a­ DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45 separately and then mix the two types of transformed competent cells together and plate them on LB agar plates containing both kanamycin and ampicillin, no colonies will grow. This observation demonstrated that only cotransformants carrying both pET28a­DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45 are resistant to both antibiotics, which in turn proved the success of cotransformation. To study the effect of selection pressure on the maintenance of the two plasmids, cotransformants of pET28a­DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45 were inoculated into liquid LB medium containing both ampicillin and kanamycin. Culture samples were taken at the indicated time points and then diluted and spread on two kinds of LB agar plates, one with both antibiotics and the other with no antibiotics. After overnight incubation at 37 C, the number of colonies grown on each plate was counted and then used to calculate the ratio of colonies growing on plates with two antibiotics to those on plates without antibiotics. This ratio represents the proportion of E. coli cells carrying both plasmids to total E. coli cells at the time when the sample was taken. As shown in Fig. 2, after continuous culturing for 14 h in liquid LB medium with two antibiotics, more than 75% of the daughter cells were still resistant to both ampicillin and kanamycin; that is, they carried both pET28a­DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45. However, in the control set in which cotransformants were cultured for 14 h in liquid LB medium lacking antibiotics, only about 15% of the daughter cells were resistant to ampicillin and kanamycin, which indicated that most cells had

lost at least one of the two plasmids. The above results demonstrate that selection pressure is indispensable in maintaining two incompatible plasmids in one E. coli cell and also suggest that although the antibiotics in culture medium may be gradually degraded or inactivated by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the two incompatible plasmids can still be maintained in most E. coli cells for at least 14 h under the above conditions, which is adequate for routine bacteria culture and foreign proteins expression. Coexpression of DFF40 and DFF45 E. coli BL21(DE3) is lysogenic for bacteriophage DE3, which contains the T7 bacteriophage gene (encoding T7 RNA polymerase) under the control of lacUV5 promoter. Adding IPTG to a growing culture induces the expression of T7 RNA polymerase, which in turn transcribes the target gene cloned downstream of T7 promoter. In recombinant plasmids pET28a­DFF40 and pET21a­DFF45, coding regions of DFF40 and DFF45 are both controlled by T7 promoter. Therefore, when these two plasmids coexist in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, addition of IPTG will induce expression of both DFF40 and DFF45. As shown in Fig. 3, DFF40 and DFF45 are coexpressed efficiently in E. coli, and the desired products comprised about 17 and 30% of total cell proteins, respectively. After coexpression of DFF40 and DFF45, cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Both the soluble and the insoluble fractions of cell lysates were analyzed by SDS­PAGE. Both Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 4A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B) showed that part of coexpressed DFF40 was soluble (Fig. 4, lanes 7­9). In contrast, when DFF40 was expressed alone, it aggregated and formed insoluble inclusion bodies (Fig. 4, lanes 3­5). This result is consistent

with previous reports that DFF45 is not only the inhibitor of DFF40, but also has DFF40-specific chaperonelike activity (7­9). It is worth noticing that part of the coexpressed DFF45 existed as inclusion bodies, while DFF45 expressed alone is entirely soluble (12). A plausible explanation is that, during coexpression, DFF45 binds to DFF40 so that part of DFF45 is brought to the formation of inclusion bodies by the insoluble part of DFF40. Using two incompatible plasmids, we have coexpressed DFF40 and DFF45 in E. coli at high levels and proved that part of DFF40 was soluble. Then we incubated the soluble proteins from E. coli-coexpressing DFF40 and DFF45 with purified recombinant caspase3 and mouse liver nuclei to testify whether the recombinant product retained its native caspase-activated DNase activity. As shown in Fig. 5, the chromosomal DNA of mouse liver nuclei was degraded into oligonucleosomal fragments and shows remarkable DNA ladder after 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5, lane 3), while DFF40 expressed alone exhibited no apoptosis-specific DNase activity (Fig. 5, lane 2). The above results further confirmed the success of coexpressing human DFF40 and DFF45 in E. coli using two incompatible plasmids. DISCUSSION Despite the common concept of plasmid incompatibility, we found that two incompatible plasmids carrying different antibiotic resistance genes are able to coexist in E. coli for at least 14 h under the selection with these two antibiotics simultaneously. Based on this discovery,

flow and increases the effective hands-on time. Its complexity was shown in coexpression of the three subunits of replication protein A (RPA). In order to study the subunit interactions and the formation of RPA complex, Henricksen et al. had to construct altogether seven expression vectors (three monocistronic vectors, three bicistronic vectors, and one tricistronic vector) to express the three subunits individually and in different combinations in E. coli (19). The other strategy relies on the two-plasmid coexpression system in which foreign genes are cloned in two different vectors (20­25). Due to its wide application and high copy number, a ColE1-derived plasmid is the most attractive candidate. Its partner is often a ColE1-compatible plasmid which carries a different replicon to avoid competition in replication and segregation and ultimate loss of one plasmid. However, most commercially available expression vectors carry ColE1 replicon and belong to the same incompatibility group. In addition, many ColE1-compatible plasmids (such as p15A-derived plasmids) are of low copy numbers, which not only makes it difficult and time-consuming to construct vectors and screen for transformants, but also reduces the level of mRNA transcript and subsequent protein translation of the cloned foreign genes in E. coli cells (21). Our work revealed that two incompatible vectors carrying different antibiotic-resistance genes, under the selection pressure of the two antibiotics, can also coexist in one E. coli cell and be used for protein coexpression. One merit of this new method is its convenience. Since

we proposed a new method for protein coexpression using such two incompatible vectors. Because of the interesting property of DFF, whose two subunits DFF40 and DFF45 must be expressed together to obtain functional products, we chose to coexpress DFF40 and DFF45 to test the practicability of our method. Two incompatible plasmids with different antibiotic resistance were used as expression vectors for DFF40 and DFF45, respectively, and cotransformation as well as subsequent culture and coexpression were all performed in the presence of both antibiotics. The yields of both recombinant proteins were high, and functional products were obtained, which demonstrated the feasibility of our new coexpression method. There are mainly two strategies to coexpress proteins in E. coli. One is to use a bicistronic vector, which is generated by cloning two target genes into one plasmid (13­18). Since it requires two SD sequences in the multiple cloning sites to coexpress foreign proteins, the cloning process is much more complicated. Besides, when the two recombinant proteins are required to express individually, new monocistronic expression vectors must be constructed, which complicates the work

there are a large variety of commercially available ColE1 ori vectors designed for protein expression, it is very convenient to clone genes into two such expression vectors of different antibiotic resistance and cotransform E. coli with them to coexpress proteins. No special considerations are needed, except that each vector should carry a different antibiotic resistance gene for selection. Two plasmids from one vector system may be used; for example, both may be pET derivatives, and in such a situation, high copy numbers of both plasmids are guaranteed, which compensates for the deficiency of using two compatible plasmids.
