Background: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential cofactor involved in fundamental processes in cell metabolism. The enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMN AT) plays a key role in NAD+ biosynthesis, catalysing the condensation of nicotinamide mononucleotide and ATP, and yielding NAD+ and pyrophosphate. Given its vital role in cell life, the enzyme represents a possible target for the development of new antibacterial agents. Results: The structure of NMN AT from Methanococcus jannaschii in complex with ATP has been solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.0 Å resolution, using a combination of single isomorphous replacement and density modification techniques. The structure reveals a hexamer with 32 point group symmetry composed of / topology subunits. The catalytic site is located in a deep cleft on the surface of each subunit, where one ATP molecule and one Mg2+ are observed. A strictly conserved HXGH motif (in single-letter amino acid code) is involved in ATP binding and recognition. Conclusions: The structure of NMN AT closely resembles that of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase. Remarkably, in spite of the fact that the two enzymes share the same fold and hexameric assembly, a striking difference in their quaternary structure is observed. Moreover, on the basis of structural similarity including the HXGH motif, we identify NMN AT as a novel member of the newly proposed superfamily of nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterases. Our structural data suggest that the catalytic mechanism does not rely on the direct involvement of any protein residues and is likely to be carried out through optimal positioning of substrates and transition-state stabilisation, as is proposed for other members of the nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterase superfamily.

Introduction
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential and ubiquitous coenzyme that plays a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. It is involved in biochemical processes such as redox reactions, DNA repair and recombination, and protein ADP ribosylation [1,2]. Intensive studies have been conducted on several enzymes involved in the NAD+ biosynthetic pathway, with profound differences being observed among different organisms [2]. The coenzyme biosynthesis can be accomplished either via a de novo pathway or via NAD+ recycling salvage routes [2]. In prokaryotes the early part of the de novo pathway involves the enzymes L-aspartate oxidase, quinolinate synthetase and quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, which convert L-aspartic acid into nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). In eukaryotes the first part of NAD+ biosynthesis proceeds via the oxidation of tryptophan resulting in quinolinate production, which is then transformed into NaMN by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase [2].

NaMN is then converted into nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD+), via the action of the ubiquitous enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMN AT), and into NAD+ by means of NAD+ synthetase. Once synthesized, NAD+ can be recycled within one of the known salvage routes [2]. All the described biochemical pathways converge to the reaction catalyzed by NMN AT (EC 2.7.7.1), which plays a central role in NAD+ biosynthesis in all living organisms [2]. NMN AT catalyses the condensation of ATP and NaMN or NMN, yielding NaAD+ or NAD+, respectively, depending on the organism [2]. The reaction proceeds via a nucleophilic attack by the 5 phosphate of the mononucleotide on the -phosphate of ATP, releasing the dinucleotide and PPi [3] (Figure 1). Although the eukaryotic enzyme catalyses NaAD+ and NAD+ synthesis at similar rates, the prokaryotic enzyme prefers the deamidated substrate (NaMN), with the exception of NMN AT from Lactobacillus fructosus and Haemophilus sp. [2]. Interestingly, human NMN AT

was shown to be localised in the nucleus [4]. This could be related to the consistent demand for NAD+ as a substrate for nuclear poly(ADP) ribosylation reactions of histones and related proteins [5]. Moreover, it has been reported that NMN AT activity, which is critical for cell survival, is profoundly altered in highly proliferating cells, making the enzyme a potential target for cancer chemotherapy [6]. In this respect, a further relevant matter is the involvement of NMN AT in the cellular metabolism of the potent oncolytic agent tiazofurin [7,8]. NMN AT belongs to the adenylyltransferase family, which includes aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, CoA ligases, luciferases, ATP sulfurylases, and adenylylsulfate-phosphate adenylyltransferase [9­13]. A peculiar feature of NMN AT is the strong conservation of the HXGH sequence motif (Figure 2). A very similar highly conserved motif, H/TXGH, has been recognized as the signature fingerprint of another superfamily of enzymes, the nucleotydyltransferase / phosphodiesterases. The new superfamily, which includes class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, has been recognized not only on the basis of this motif but

also on structural similarities made evident by the crystal structures of Escherichia coli phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) and Bacillus subtilis glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (GCT) [14­16]. The members of this family, which share a dinucleotide-binding fold, are thought to have a similar nucleotidylation mechanism [14,15]. In this context we have determined the crystal structure of recombinant NMN AT from Methanococcus jannaschii in complex with ATP at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure reveals a hexameric assembly with 32 point group symmetry, composed of / topology subunits (168 residues per chain), with the ATP-binding site located in a deep cleft on the surface of each subunit. On the basis of structure­function considerations we have identified NMN AT as a novel member of the newly proposed superfamily of nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterases. Within a general framework of structural characterisation of enzymes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis, the structure of M. jannaschii NMN AT represents the fourth to be reported, after the structures of NAD+ synthetase [17], quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase [18,19] and L-aspartate oxidase [20].

Results and discussion
Overall quality of the model

The structure of the NMN AT­ATP complex was solved by means of the single isomorphous replacement (SIR) method in conjunction with sixfold density averaging. The current model contains 984 residues (residues 1­164 in each protomer), 664 solvent molecules, six ATP molecules and six Mg2+ ions, with an R factor of 0.215 and Rfree of 0.264 at 2.0 Å resolution. No electron density is present for the C-terminal region comprising residues 165­168 in each subunit. The stereochemistry of the refined model has been assessed with the program PROCHECK [21]. The Ramachandran plot shows 91% of the residues in the most favoured region and no outliers. Residue 11 has been recognized as a cis proline.
Structure of hexameric NMN AT

consists of a single / domain, the core of which is a highly twisted five-stranded parallel open  sheet flanked on both sides by  helices (Figure 3b). This topological organisation closely resembles the well known six-stranded dinucleotide-binding domain (or Rossmann fold) [22]. The quaternary assembly of NMN AT consists of a homohexamer displaying 32 point group symmetry (Figures 4a,b), in keeping with the observed hexameric aggregation state of the enzyme in solution (evaluated using gel-filtration chromatography (NR, unpublished results). The overall quaternary structure can be viewed as a trimer of dimers, where two major intersubunit interfaces can be distinguished. The first consists of tightly associated protomers related by a dyad axis (Figures 4a,b and 5a), whereas the second involves protomers related by the noncrystallographic threefold axis (Figures 4a,b). Upon dimer formation, 900 Å2 of the accessible surface is buried on each monomer. Many interactions occurring across the dyad axis participate in dimer stabilisation. In particular, as determined using programs from the CCP4 suite [23], nine hydrogen bonds and a number of hydrophobic contacts, including those provided by a

The strong positive electrostatic potential reflects the value of 8.5 for the isoelectric point of NMN AT, determined using isoelectric focusing chromatography.

Pro69­Ile70­Pro71­Ile72 motif, are observed. Moreover, a strong salt bridge is established between Glu153 of one monomer and Arg2 of the other (3.1 Å), both invariant residues in all archaeal NMN ATs (Figure 2). A further contribution to the dimer stabilisation comes from the attractive interaction between the dipoles of helix H3 in one subunit and helix H4 of the other [24]. These two  helices are oriented in such a way that the N terminus of helix H3 lies just in front of the C terminus of helix H4 (Figure 5a). In the case of protomers related by the triad axis we observed six hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge, formed by Glu108 and Arg159 (3.7 Å), and 850 Å2 of accessible surface area are buried on each monomer upon trimer formation [23]. The approximate overall dimensions of the globular hexamer of NMN AT are 60 Å along the triad axis and 50 Å across it (Figures 4a,b). As can be seen in Figures 4a and b, a solvent channel that crosses the entire hexamer runs along the noncrystallographic threefold axis. This channel has a narrow cross-section of 11 Å roughly located in the centre of the hexamer, at the trimer­trimer interface (Figures 4a,b). Within each subunit the catalytic site is located in a deep cleft that faces the channel and extends from the top of the hexamer to the trimer­trimer interface. The entrance of the channel is surrounded by a number of positively charged residues, whereas negatively charged residues (Asp74 and Glu76) are located at the trimer­trimer interface (Figure 4c). The observed electrostatic distribution could allow the highly negative substrate ATP to be steered to its binding site from the bulk

solvent and, at the same time, could prevent the diffusion of substrates from one trimer to the next. A similar structural and electrostatic organisation was recently reported in the hexameric PPAT [14]. This observation points out a striking conservation of the tertiary structure, hexameric assembly and, most remarkably, of the electrostatic field within the quaternary assembly of the two enzymes. However, profound differences exist between the quaternary structures adopted by PPAT and NMN AT. In the tight dimer that represents the building unit of the hexamer in PPAT, the main structural motif that defines the interface between monomers consists of an ­ element of the Rossmann fold; it is formed by the fourth helix and the fifth  strand (Figure 5b) [14]. Conversely, in NMN AT the second  helix (H3) and the third  strand of the Rossmann fold mainly define the interface across the dimer (Figure 5a). Interestingly, in the two enzymes the topological position of the ­ structural element that defines the described dimer interface is located on opposite sides with respect to the / sheet topological switch point, where the ATP-binding site is located. Remarkably, in spite of the fact that NMN AT and PPAT share the same fold, they adopt largely different quaternary structures that yield the same oligomeric assembly.
ATP-binding site

The ATP-binding site is located at the / open sheet topological switch point, first reported in dehydrogenases [22], in a deep cleft between the first (S1) and the fourth (S4) parallel  strands (Figure 3b). Inspection of the electron density clearly shows the presence of an intact ATP molecule and the associated Mg2+ bound in this pocket (Figure 6a).

Structure

Several interactions stabilising the ATP molecule are observed, and account for the enzyme specificity with respect to the nucleotide. All the protein residues involved in ATP recognition are contributed by the subunit to which the nucleotide is bound. No intermolecular interactions between the ATP-binding pockets of the six molecules within the hexamer are observed (Figures 4a,b). Each binding site faces the channel crossing the hexamer, and is highly solvent accessible (Figures 4a,b). The adenine ring of the bound ATP is sandwiched between residue Arg121, stacking against the adenine ring with its guanidino group, and Gly15 (Figure 6b). The adenine N6 atom interacts with the carbonyl O atom of residues Phe119 and Tyr124 (at a distance of 2.94 Å in both cases), and the adenine N1 atom hydrogen bonds to the mainchain nitrogen of residue Phe119 (2.91 Å; Figure 6b). Remarkably, neither of the two

hydroxyl groups of the ribose is hydrogen bonded to any residue. Only two loose hydrogen bonds are established with water molecules W46 (2.90 Å from O3) and W314 (3.40 Å from O2; Figure 6b). Next to the adenosine moiety, the three phosphate groups of ATP are stabilised by interactions with several protein residues. The -phosphate forms a salt bridge to residue Arg8 (NH1 and NH2 atoms at 2.96 Å and 3.01 Å, respectively) and residue Arg130 (NH2 atom at 2.7 Å). Moreover, a strong hydrogen bond between the -phosphate O33 atom and the hydroxyl group of Thr127 (distance of 2.65 Å) is observed (Figure 6b). The -phosphate oxygen atoms interact with Arg121 NH2 (distance of 2.67 Å) and with the mainchain nitrogen atom of Ser126 (3.05 Å). Furthermore, the -phosphate is centered at the N terminus of the H6 helix, the dipole of which participates in ATP stabilisation [24] (Figures 3b,6b).

Structure

Of particular relevance are the observed interactions between ATP and residues that form part of the fingerprint sequence H(13)XGH(16), which is located at the boundary between the loop connecting the S1  strand with the H1  helix and helix H1 itself (Figures 3b,6b). His13 NE2 is hydrogen bonded to the -phosphate oxygen of ATP (at a distance of 2.91 Å), whereas His16 NE2 and the mainchain nitrogen atom of Arg8 interact with the -phosphate oxygens (distances of 3.23 Å and 2.97 Å, respectively; Figure 6b). Phe9 shows an edge-on orientation of its aromatic ring with that of His16 (closest distance of 3.6 Å), consistent with the formation of an aromatic hydrogen bond between the two [25,26] (Figure 6b). Therefore, Phe9 contributes to fixing the observed orientation of His16, supporting the hypothesis of an important role played by this histidine residue in the reaction catalysed by nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterases [12­15,27]. An overall view of the ATP-binding site reveals a strong positive electrostatic field (three arginine and two histidine residues are involved in ATP binding) and a remarkable

number of interactions with protein mainchain atoms (Figures 4c,6b). A peak in the Fo­Fc electron-density map located close to the - and -phosphate groups of ATP has been modelled as Mg2+. This identification was made on consideration of the crystallization medium composition and the ideal octahedral coordination observed, and is in keeping with the known coordination behaviour of this cation (Figure 6a) [28]. The observed peak was definitively assigned to Mg2+ following difference Fourier analysis, at 2.7 Å resolution, on a crystal of the ATP complex soaked for 24 h in a solution containing 34% Jeffamine M600, 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5, 2 mM ATP and 2 mM MnCl2 (in absence of CsCl). A strong peak (8.1 above the root mean square deviation [rmsd] electron density) has been located at the same site that was provisionally interpreted as Mg2+. The Mg2+ ligands are provided by -, - and -phosphate oxygen atoms at 2.4 Å, 2.3 Å and 2.3 Å, respectively

(Figure 6b). The coordination sphere is completed by water molecules W398, W359 and W632 at distances of 2.26 Å, 2.30 Å and 2.20 Å, respectively (Figure 6b); the Mg2+ site is fully occupied and the cation displays B factors ranging from 50 Å2 to 65 Å2 in the six subunits.
Structures similar to NMN AT: a family of nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterases

ATP binding [14]. In both structures two strong hydrogen bonds are observed between the N1 and N6 atoms of the adenine moiety of ATP and protein mainchain atoms (residues Phe119/Tyr124 and Trp124/Ile127 in NMN AT/PPAT, respectively). It has been recently reported, on the basis of structural comparisons, that both GCT and PPAT belong to the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase fold family [14,15]. Such findings led to a new superfamily of nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterases that possess a highly conserved T/HXGH sequence fingerprint and are characterised by the presence of a dinucleotide-binding fold [14]. We observed remarkable structural similarities, extending beyond the overall fold and topology, between NMN AT and PPAT, GCT and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (taken as prototype for the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as a result of the high ranks produced by DALI) (Figure 7). Significantly, the nucleotide-binding mode is very similar in all structures showing the nucleotide monophosphate moiety (NMP) bound with the same orientation (Figure 7). In all cases, the highly conserved H/TXGH sequence motif is involved in nucleotide binding, with a particularly striking structural conservation of the second histidine of the motif. An additional relevant analogy is the strict structural conservation of a positively charged residue located in the nucleotide-binding site, where Arg121 contacts the ATP -phosphate in NMN AT. The same topological position is occupied by Arg260 in E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase [27,29], whereas Arg91 and Arg113 are observed in PPAT and GCT, respectively [14,15] (Figure 7a,b). Overall, our results led us to include NMN AT in the newly proposed nucleotidyltransferase superfamily of / phosphodiesterases characterised by the presence of a conserved dinucleotide-binding fold [14].
Implications for catalysis

The three-dimensional structure of NMN AT shows a remarkable similarity to the structures of GCT [15] and the dinucleotide-binding domain of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase from E. coli [29], as revealed by the highest scores produced by a DALI search [30]. In fact, NMN AT and GCT, which share 16% sequence identity, can be superposed with an rmsd of 2.5 Å for 115 C pairs, whereas NMN AT and the dinucleotide-binding domain of E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase superpose with an rmsd of 3.2 Å for 135 C pairs. Moreover, a striking structural similarity is observed between NMN AT and PPAT (displaying 20% sequence identity), which can be superposed with an rmsd of 2.2 Å for 143 C pairs (rmsd of 0.37 Å for C pairs of residues belonging to the conserved H/TXGH motif) (the coordinates of PPAT were kindly provided by T Izard, personal communication). All of these enzymes catalyse the transfer of a nucleotide monophosphate moiety on different substrates and belong to a nucleotidyltransferase family. Aminoacyl-tRNAs convert an amino acid to aminoacyl adenylate prior to linkage with its cognate tRNA [9]. GCT cleaves the / phosphodiester bond of CTP by an attack of the phosphate group of glycerol-3-phosphate on the -phosphate of CTP [15]. PPAT transforms phosphopantetheine into dephospho-coenzymeA (dPCoA) via a reaction in which the phosphate group of phosphopantetheine attacks the -phosphate of ATP, producing dPCoA and delivering pyrophosphate [14,31]. As NMN AT and PPAT catalyse the two most closely related reactions, a detailed structural comparison of NMN AT and PPAT has been conducted. The structurally homologous regions in NMN AT and PPAT chiefly include the central  strand and the flanking  helices. The ATP-binding sites are remarkably similar in the two enzymes, with striking structurally conserved features in the T/HXGH motif (Figure 7a). In NMN AT, His16 N is hydrogen bonded to the mainchain nitrogen atom of His13, and is therefore neutral (Figure 6b). The same arrangement is observed in PPAT [14] where His18 hydrogen bonds with the mainchain nitrogen atom of Thr15, as was also reported for the HXGH motif residues of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase [27]. Moreover, residue Phe9 in NMN AT, which contributes to the orientation of His16, is also conserved in PPAT (Phe11). In NMN AT, Arg130 and Arg8, both engaged in stabilisation of the ATP - and -phosphates, are structurally equivalent to PPAT Lys133 and Lys42, respectively, which were postulated to be involved in

The reaction catalyzed by NMN AT from M. jannaschii proceeds via the adenylation of either NaMN or NMN to produce NaAD+ or NAD+ and PPi [32,33] (Figure 1). Although the catalytic mechanism of NMN AT has not been fully elucidated, the first structural description of the organisation of the catalytic site, reported here, allows us to shed light on some details of the reaction mechanism. Inspection of the structure of the NMN AT­ATP complex reveals, in each subunit, a long and highly solvent-accessible cleft, the upper part of which is occupied by an intact ATP molecule and a Mg2+ ion (Figures 3b,4a,b,6b). The cleft extends towards the trimer­trimer interface, with an overall length of roughly 30 Å, and is bordered at its lower part by Trp81, Asp74 and Lys39 (Figure 6a). The catalytic site of each protomer faces the channel running through the hexamer and is entirely built from residues belonging to a single subunit

(Figures 4a,b). The ATP molecule binds at the enzyme active site, in the upper part of the long cleft, and is highly bent at the ­ phosphate bond. The pyrophosphate moiety is located in a positive adjacent pocket (Figures 3b and 6b) in a conformation that resembles that observed in glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase [27]. Most notably, the ATP -phosphate group, which forms the pentacovalent transition-state intermediate in the reaction catalysed by NMN AT, is surrounded by a cluster of positively charged residues including Arg8, Arg121 and the two histidines (His13 and His16) that are part of the HXGH motif (Figure 6). These residues are likely to play an important catalytic role, stabilising the transition-state intermediate

and enhancing the electrophilic character of the -phosphate, thus facilitating its reactivity with NaMN or NMN. Similarly, the presence of Mg2+, which is observed at 3.1 Å from the -phosphorous, might not only have a structural role but might also act as a polariser (Lewis acid) that favours the nucleophilic attack on the ATP -phosphorous atom and stabilises the PPi leaving group (Figure 6). Enzymatic catalysis proceeding via nucleotidylation of the substrate, carried out by enzymes of the family of nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterases, has been extensively studied. For all these enzymes it has been suggested that the nucleotidylation process does not imply

any direct involvement of covalent or acid­base catalysis deriving from enzyme functional groups [14,15,27,34]. The enzymes seem to provide an active site, carefully designed to properly orient the interacting substrates, and to intervene directly in the stabilisation of the transition state. Our structural data suggest the same behaviour for NMN AT, where a constellation of positive residues surrounds the ATP -phosphate (Figure 6b). Moreover, in the case of NMN AT we suggest a role in catalysis for the Mg2+ ion, which could be involved in the stabilisation of the transition-state intermediate as well as in weakening the ATP ­ phosphate bond. The same catalytic strategy has also been proposed previously for the first step of the reaction catalysed by NAD+ synthetase, where NaAD+ is coupled to ATP, producing NAD+ adenylate and PPi [35]. Both NAD+ synthetase and NMN AT adopt a dinucleotide-binding fold based on a five parallel-stranded  sheet. As NAD+ synthetase catalyses a step in NAD+ biosynthesis following that catalysed by NMN AT, our observation could represent an example of two enzymes involved in the same biochemical pathway, which share not only their three-dimensional architecture but also an equivalent strategy for catalysis.

Although NMN AT and PPAT share the same fold, they adopt an entirely different quaternary structure assembly to yield a hexameric enzyme with the same point group symmetry and a conserved electrostatic-field distribution. Significant structural similarities between NMN AT, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase and PPAT allow us to identify NMN AT as a novel member of the newly proposed nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterase protein homology superfamily. The nucleotide-binding mode is very similar in all members of the family and, most notably, the highly conserved H/TXGH sequence motif is, in all cases, involved in nucleotide recognition and stabilisation. Analysis of the present structure suggests that catalysis in NMN AT does not directly rely on involvement of any protein residues. Instead, catalysis is likely to be carried out via optimal positioning of substrates and stabilisation of the transition-state, in agreement with what has been proposed for the other enzymes of the nucleotidyltransferase / phosphodiesterase superfamily.

Materials and methods Biological implications
plays a vital role in the metabolic network of the cell, being directly involved in fundamental processes such as redox equilibrium, DNA repair and recombination, and protein ADP ribosylation. NAD+ homeostasis is therefore a crucial task that must be carefully tuned in every living organism. These considerations suggest that enzymes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis represent potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMN AT), a key enzyme in NAD+ biosynthesis, catalyses the condensation of ATP and nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) or NMN, yielding nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD+) or NAD+. Interestingly, the eukaryotic enzyme is localised in the nucleus and its activity is deeply altered in highly proliferating cells, making the enzyme a potential target for cancer chemotherapy. The hexameric structure of NMN AT from Methanococcus jannaschhi is built of / topology subunits. The hexamer is endowed with 32 point symmetry; a channel with a narrow cross-section of 11 Å runs along the hexamer threefold axis. The catalytic site is located in a long cleft on the surface of each subunit, with two histidine residues, part of a strictly conserved HXGH sequence motif, involved in ATP binding. The three-dimensional structure and the electrostatic field observed in NMN AT closely resemble those of the E. coli hexameric phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase NAD+
Crystallisation
The recombinant protein used in the crystallisation experiments was purified from E. coli as previously described [32]. The protein was provided in a buffered solution containing 0.02 M Tris at pH 8.0, 2 mM ATP and 2 mM MgCl2; the protein has been proven to be active under these conditions (NR, unpublished results). Crystals of M. jannashii NMN AT in complex with ATP were grown using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method by equilibrating 2 µl purified protein solution at a concentration of 20 mg/ml against an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 30% v/v Jeffamine M600 (pH 7.0) from Hampton research Inc., 0.05 M CsCl and 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5. The crystals grew to a size of approximately 0.25 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm, in about four to five days at 4°C. Analysis of the diffraction data sets collected allowed us to assign the NMN AT crystals to the monoclinic space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 79.30 Å, b = 112.90 Å c = 80.30 Å,  = 117.30°. The NMN AT crystals contain six molecules per asymmetric unit (126,000 Da), with a corresponding calculated lattice packing parameter of 2.54 Å3 Da­1 (52% solvent content) [36]. Despite the fact that all the tested crystals had similar cell parameters, evaluation of the diffracted intensities showed large variations among different native data sets (R deriv ranging between 25% and 30%; Table 1).

Data collection and structure solution
For data collection and heavy-atom screening the crystals were transferred to a stabilising solution containing 34% Jeffamine M600, 0.05 M CsCl, 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5, 2 mM ATP and 2 mM MgCl2. Diffraction data sets used for SIR phasing were collected in-house on a Rigaku RAXIS II image plate system ( = 1,514 Å), whereas the high-resolution data set employed in refinement was collected using synchrotron radiation at the beam line BW7B at EMBL/DESY (Hamburg, Germany;  = 0,8139 Å ). For all the X-ray diffraction data sets collected crystals were transferred to the stabilising solution (for a few hours in the case of heavy atoms and for a few seconds for the native), mounted on a thread loop and flash-frozen at 100K under a nitrogen stream. Diffracted intensities were evaluated and integrated using the program MOSFLM [37], whereas the CCP4 suite was used for data reduction [23].

Phasing power = |FH | / E, where FH is the calculated heavy-atom structure Table 1 gives a summary of the data collection statistics for the two native data sets as well as for the platinum derivative used for structure solution. The soaking time for the platinum derivative was 5 h at a concentration of 1.5 mM. The K2PtCl4 isomorphous difference Patterson map was solved using SHELXS-90 [38] and heavy-atom parameters were refined using MLPHARE [39]; phasing statistics are reported in Table 2. The initial SIR electron-density map did not allow chain tracing, providing only a clear identification of the protein boundaries. The initial SIR phases were then dramatically improved by means of sixfold density averaging. Self-rotation function calculation, performed using the program AmoRe [40], showed two strong peaks located at  = 120.5,  = 87.0,  = 87.7 (6.95 over rmsd) and at  = 180.1,  = 355.2,  = 62.4 (6.2 over rmsd) [41]. This result, together with the position of the six heavy-atom sites located in the difference Patterson, clearly indicated the presence of a hexamer in the asymmetric unit having 32 point group symmetry. The locations of the noncrystallographic threefold and twofold axes were determined with the program GLRF [42] used in the real-space translation function mode (option tfun = 2). The noncrystallographic-symmetry operators were then refined with the program IMP, part of the rave suite of programs [43], and a mask covering a single monomer was determined. The SIR phases were then improved by simultaneous application of sixfold density averaging, solvent flattening and histogram matching with phase extension from 5.0 Å to 3.0 Å, as implemented in the program DM [23,44]. The resulting electron-density map allowed us to trace 90% of the whole protein. The O package [45] was used in the model-building stage and a polypeptide chain was easily built. Nevertheless, three major breaks were present in the electron-density map between residues 61­66, 131­138 and 151­155.

refinement. The program O was used for manual rebuilding of the model [44]. The initial model (90% of the whole molecule) was subjected to ten cycles of rigid-body refinement in the 15.0­4.0 Å resolution range, lowering the R factor and the Rfree to 39% and 41%, respectively. Subsequently, 50 cycles of REFMAC were performed, and a drop of the crystallographic R factor to 34% was observed (Rfree 36%). At this stage of refinement, the electron density allowed sequence identification and unambiguous tracing of the three regions not visible in the initial model (zones 61­66, 131­138 and 151­155). Accordingly, all the sidechains were inserted in the model at this stage and additional 50 cycles of refinement were carried out, and an R factor and Rfree of 26% and 28%, respectively, were obtained. At this point inspection of the 3Fo­2Fc and 2Fo­2Fc electron-density maps showed (for each subunit) the presence of one intact ATP molecule and a Mg2+ ion. In order to exclude a possible misinterpretation of the observed peak (Cs versus Mg2+) the CsClbinding capability to NMN AT has been investigated in solution. Within a CsCl concentration range of 2 mM to 100 mM, no effect on enzymatic activity has been detected (NR, unpublished results). Moreover, the Table 3 Refinement statistics.

Crystallographic refinement
The crystallographic refinement was carried out at 2.0 Å resolution on the data set collected using synchrotron radiation and employing REFMAC [46]. A random sample containing 1006 reflections (roughly 1% of the total number of reflections) was excluded from the refinement and used for the calculation of the free R factor [47]. Tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained throughout all the different stages of

apparent Km value for Mg2+ (0.5 mM) (NR, unpublished results), taken as an indicator of binding affinity, is compatible with Mg2+ binding in the conditions used for crystallization (2 mM MgCl2). After fitting of ATP and Mg2+, based on 3Fo­2Fc and 2Fo­2Fc electrondensity maps, 50 cycles of REFMAC in conjunction with ARP [47,48] used to locate water molecules automatically were performed. A final round of 20 cycles of refinement was carried out on the resulting model until convergence at an R factor of 21.5% and Rfree of 26.4%. The current model contains 984 amino acid residues, 664 water molecules, six ATP molecules and six Mg2+ ions. The C-terminal polypeptide residues 165­168 are not visible in the electron density in all subunits. The average B factors for the 8067 protein atoms and for the 664 ordered water molecules are 36.5 Å2 and 43.9 Å2 (33.9 Å2 for the mainchain and 39.1 Å2 for the sidechains), respectively. The results of the refinement are summarised in Table 3.
