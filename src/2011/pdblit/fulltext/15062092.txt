Abstract The focus of this minireview is to discuss the state of knowledge of the pathways and rates of proton transfer in the bacterial reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Protons involved in the light driven catalytic reduction of a quinone molecule QB to quinol QB H2 travel from the aqueous solution through well de¢ned proton transfer pathways to the oxygen atoms of the quinone. Three main topics are discussed: (1) the pathways for proton transfer involving the residues: HisH126, His-H128, Asp-L210, Asp-M17, Asp-L213, Ser-L223 and Glu-L212, which were determined by a variety of methods including the use of proton uptake inhibiting metal ions (e.g. Zn2+ and Cd2+); (2) the rate constants for proton transfer, obtained from a `chemical rescue' study was determined to be U 2U105 s31 and 2U104 s31 for the proton uptake to Glu-L212 U and Q3c , respectively; (3) structural studies of altered proton B transfer pathways in revertant RCs that lack the key amino acid Asp-L213 show a series of structural changes that propagate toward L213 potentially allowing Glu-H173 to participate in the proton transfer processes. ß 2003 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Proton transfer reactions between proton donors and acceptors are of crucial importance for biological energy conversion in many biological systems. Many of the proton transfer reactions are coupled to other light induced or redox induced events such as electron transfer. Some examples of these proton coupled electron transfer reactions occur in the processes of oxygen evolution in photosynthesis, oxygen re-

duction in respiration and the quinone reduction cycle that couples electron transfer to proton pumping across biological membranes [1^3]. The determination of the X-ray crystal structure of the membrane proteins that catalyze these reactions [4^9] combined with biochemical and biophysical studies relating structure and function have provided insight into the mechanisms of this type of coupling in bioenergetic systems. Common to these systems is the requirement of a proton transfer mechanism for the uptake and/or release of protons from the interior of a protein to the exterior aqueous solution. This involves speci¢c proton transfer pathways (often called a proton wire). In this minireview, we discuss studies of the proton coupled electron transfer reaction leading to the reduction of the quinone molecule QB in the bacterial reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Proton coupled electron transfer in the RC has been extensively studied by many workers [10^12]. In this paper, we review more recent results that elucidate the pathway and mechanism of proton transfer. The RC is the membrane bound pigment^protein complex that is responsible for light induced electron transfer in photosynthesis. Light initiates electron transfer from a primary electron donor D through a series of electron acceptors to a primary quinone QA . The reduced Q3 serves as the electron A donor to a weakly bound quinone QB (Fig. 1). Following reduction of Dþ by an exogenous donor, QB accepts a second photo induced electron from Q3c , taking up two protons from A solution resulting in the formation of the fully reduced dihydroquinone. The overall reaction is:

QB þ 2e3 þ 2Hþ þ 2 hX ! QB H2

ð1Þ

In photosynthetic membranes the reduced QB H2 is released to the membrane and oxidized by the cytochrome bc1 complex releasing the protons across the membrane into the periplasm, generating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis [1]. The electrons are cycled back to Dþ of the RC via a mobile electron carrier cytochrome c2 [13]. Thus, the coupling of proton transfer and electron transfer plays an essential role in the basic process of energy transduction in photosynthesis. 2. Proton coupled electron transfer reactions The formation of quinol occurs in two sequential light inð1Þ duced steps with observed rate constants kAB for the ¢rst ð2Þ electron reduction and kAB for the second (Eqs. 2 and 3). The ¢rst light induced reaction results in electron transfer from Q3c to QB and is coupled to the protonation of a nearby A carboxylic group Glu-L212 (Glu3 in Eq. 2).

where kHþð1Þ and ketð1Þ are the rate constants for proton and electron transfer, respectively [14]. The second light induced reaction resulting in electron transfer from Q3c is coupled to A the ¢rst direct protonation of the semiquinone. The mechanism of the proton coupled electron transfer reaction (Eq. 3) was shown to be a two step process in which fast protonation precedes the rate limiting electron transfer step [15].

where kHþð2Þ and ketð2Þ are the rate constants for proton and electron transfer, respectively. Following the ¢nding that the RC could be co-puri¢ed with an externally bound Zn2þ [16], a systematic study of transition metal binding showed that Zn2þ and Cd2þ bound stoichiometrically (pH 7.8) to the RC surface and inhibited the ¢rst protonation step [17]. This resulted in a change in the rate controlling step from electron transfer (ketð2Þ ) to proton uptake (kHþð2Þ ). Subsequent internal proton transfer of Hþ from Glu-L212 (Eq. 4) leads to the formation of quinol.

Note that although the H in Eq. 4 is taken up from solution during the ¢rst electron transfer step (Eq. 2), it protonates Glu3 (Eq. 2) and is transferred to reduced QB only after the second electron transfer step (Eq. 3). 3. Pathways for proton transfer The structure of the RC from Rb. sphaeroides between the surface and the catalytic Q3c site is shown in Fig. 1 [18]. The B two quinone molecules, QA and QB , are separated by a disî tance of 15 A (edge to edge) through hydrogen bonding to the His^Fe^His metal link. The region of the protein near QB contains numerous acidic and polar residues that have been shown to be involved in the pathway for transfer of the two protons that are bound by the reduced quinone. The protons involved in the reactions described by Eqs. 1^4 are taken up from the cytoplasm. Several key components of these pathways have been determined from studies of the e¡ects of site directed mutations in isolated RCs [19^24]. Three residues (Glu-L212, Ser-L223 and Asp-L213), located î near Q3c ( 9 5 A) were shown to play a crucial role. The entry B point of the protons has been identi¢ed to be near His-H126, His-H128 and Asp-H124 (Fig. 1), the binding position of the proton transfer inhibitors Zn2þ and Cd2þ [25]. The importance of His-H126 and His-H128 for facilitating proton transfer into the RC was subsequently con¢rmed through site directed mutagenesis [24]. Located between the surface His and the internal acids are Asp-L210 and Asp-M17, which upon replacement with Asn decrease the rate of proton transfer by 100-fold [26]. The proton transfer pathways share the involvement of the surface His-H126 and His-H128 and the inter-

Fig. 1. Part of the RC structure showing the proton transfer pathways. Water molecules are shown as spheres [18]. Potential hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines. The proton transfer pathways connecting the surface to the QB site share the entry point and several carboxylic acids (red line) before branching to Glu-L212 (blue line) or to Q3c (magenta line). Although protonation (neutraliB zation) of Glu-L212 is required for the ¢rst electron reduction of QB to proceed (Eq. 2), the proton is transferred to the proximal oxygen of reduced QB near His-L190 only after formation of QB H3 (green line). Coordinates obtained from pdb ID number 1AIJ.

mediate carboxylic acids Asp-M17, Asp-L210 and Asp-L213. At or near Asp-L213, the pathways for the two protons diverge (see Fig. 1). Transfer of Hþ to Glu-L212 (Eq. 2) occurs through intervening water molecules. Transfer directly to Q3c B (Eq. 3) occurs through Ser-L223. Water molecules located between the acid groups likely serve as bridges or connectors providing the missing links for hydrogen bonding chains. The pathways for proton transfer are functionally robust and relatively insensitive to perturbations. This is shown by the observation that mutation of a single Asp residue (AspM17 or Asp-L210) or a single His residue (His-H126 or HisH128) near the entry point (Fig. 1) does not inhibit proton transfer su/ciently to become rate limiting. On the other hand, double mutations (Asp-M17CAsn/Asp-L210CAsn or His-H126CAla/His-H128CAla) inhibit the rate of proton transfer s 100-fold. This suggests that at least two parallel routes are operational in the pathway regions near the proton entry points (see Fig. 1). In addition, there are other possible proton transfer routes in the interior of the protein that may include other protonatable residues (e.g. Glu-H173) and water molecules, but there is no compelling evidence that they contribute signi¢cantly to the proton transfer processes. 4. Rate constants for proton transfer The rate constants for proton transfer reactions are fundamentally important in understanding the molecular basis of the proton transfer process. However, the proton transfer rate

constants are not directly obtained from measured rates of electron transfer since proton transfer is not the rate limiting step for either electron transfer (Eqs. 2 and 3). If, however, the rate of proton transfer is reduced su/ciently, then proton transfer becomes the rate limiting step. These situations arise when key residues in the proton transfer pathways are mutated (Fig. 1). To determine whether a change in the rate limiting step has occurred, we used the electron driving force ð2Þ assay [15,17], i.e. we measured the dependence of kAB on the driving force for electron transfer. When electron transfer is rate limiting, we expect from Marcus theory a V10-fold change in rate for a 100 meV change in driving force as is observed in the native RC [15]. When the rate limiting step is proton transfer, the observed rate becomes independent of the driving force [17]. For the native RC, electron transfer is rate limiting and the measured rate provides only a lower limit for the rate constant for proton transfer. Thus, the determination of the intrinsic rate constant for proton transfer remained a challenge. This challenge was met by using RCs with the double mutation of His-H126CAla/His-H128CAla. Replacement of the His with Ala resulted in an RC in which the rate limiting step in Eqs. 2 and 3 was proton uptake from solution. A detailed systematic study showed that the proton limited ð1Þ phase of kAB could be enhanced by addition of exogenous acids acting as proton carriers with an apparent second order rate constant kð2Þ ; the rate could be completely restored (chemically rescued) upon adding high concentrations of imidazole and other rescuing acids with pKa values below 9. The active species were identi¢ed as the cationic forms of the rescuing acids based on the pH and ionic strength dependence of the rate enhancement. Values of kð2Þ were measured for rescuing acids with di¡erent pKa values. The values of kð2Þ were at the di¡usion limit of 1010 M31 s31 for low pKa ( 6 4) rescuers and decreased V10-fold per pKa unit increase above this value (Bronsted coe/cient K = 1.0) [28]. A Bronsted plot [27] « «

of the log of the observed second order rate constant vs. pKa (Fig. 2) was determined and interpreted in terms of the model for kð2Þ shown in Eq. 5. The change in slope of the Bronsted « plot occurs at a pKa at which the rate controlling step of kð2Þ changes. This happens when the pKa of the donating acid approximately matches that of the acceptor group, which in our data occurs near a pKa of 4 (Fig. 2). At this pKa there is a change from a proton transfer limited rate (for higher pKa acids) to a di¡usion controlled rate (for lower pKa acids). Because the ¢nal acceptor group (Glu-L212) is known to have a much di¡erent pKa of V8.5 [11,14,19,20], the group responsible for the change in the slope of the Bronsted plot « must be an intermediate acceptor group in the proton transfer pathway. With the inclusion of this postulated intermediate proton acceptor group that we shall call A, the chemical rescue is composed of four steps (Eq. 5): (1) the binding of the rescuing acid, RHþ ; (2) proton transfer to an intermediate proton acceptor group, A3 ; (3) proton transfer to the ¢nal proton acceptor group, Glu3 ; Glu-L212 and (4) dissociation of the neutral rescuing acid, R.

ð5Þ

where RHþ and R are the protonated and unprotonated forms of the rescuing acid, respectively; A3 is the intermediate proton acceptor group; Glu is the ¢nal proton acceptor Glu-L212 (Eq. 2); kON and kOFF are the on and o¡ rate constants of the acid molecule; kOFF P is the o¡ rate of the unprotonated acid molecule; k1 and k31 are the forward and reverse proton transfer rate constants from the acid to A3 ; and k2 is the forward proton transfer rate constant from AH to Glu-L212. The process involves the electrostatic attraction and binding of the cationic rescuing acid followed by rapid and reversible proton transfer from RHþ to A3 . AH can then transfer a proton to the ¢nal acceptor Glu-L212. The observed rate is proportional to the fraction of protonated AH which depends upon the pKa of the cationic acid and the rate constant for proton transfer from AH to Glu-L212. The ¢rst equilibrium step is responsible for the Bronsted coe/cient K = 1.0 for res« cuing acids with a pKa s 4; for rescuing acids with a lower pKa the proton transfer to AH is favorable and the pKa dependence is absent. The overall proton transfer rate constant from the rescuing acid to the ¢nal acceptor is given by [29]:

Fig. 2. Bronsted plot of kð2Þ as a function of the pKa of the rescu« ing acid in the HA(H126)/HA(H128) mutant RC (modi¢ed from [28]). Below pKa W4, kð2Þ reaches the di¡usion limit of V1010 M31 s31 . At higher pKa values, kð2Þ decreases with increasing pKa , characteristic of general acid catalysis. The slope of kð2Þ versus pKa changes when the pKa of the bound donating acid matches that of the acceptor. Since the pKa of the ¢nal acceptor Glu-L212 is much larger (pKa W8.5) than the pKa at the break of the Bronsted plot, « there must exist an intermediate acceptor group (A3 ) within the proton transfer pathway. The data were ¢tted (solid curve) using Eq. 5. Note the good quality of the ¢t over the range of V9 pKa units (see [28] for details).

where kHþ is the proton transfer rate from the rescuing acid to Glu-L212. For the case of imidazole, this simpli¢es to the expression kð2Þ = kHþ /KD , where KD is the dissociation constant [28]. A value of KD = 10 mM was found for trimethyl ammonium, and assumed to be the same for all cationic acids given the good linear dependence of log kð2Þ on pKa (Fig. 2).

Fig. 3. Energy level diagram of the states involved in the proton transfer reactions from the bound imidazole (ImidHþ ) to the ¢nal proton acceptor Glu-L212 (modi¢ed from [28]). Proton transfer proceeds through an intermediate state AH which is higher in energy than the initial state by NvG1 W240 meV. Proton transfer can then proceed downhill by V330 meV to Glu-L212. The resultant forward proton transfer rate kHþ w2U105 s31 is indicated.

Since the rescue of double mutant RC with imidazole was indistinguishable from the native RC and the functional group of imidazole is the same as the native His, we used the bound imidazolium as the model for the native His. From the value of kð2Þ imidazole = 2U107 M31 s31 , the value of kHþ = 2U105 s31 is obtained for proton transfer from the bound imidazole group to Glu-L212. Similar measurements of ð2Þ chemical rescue of kAB gave a value of kHþ = 2U104 s31 for the proton transfer from the bound imidazole group to Q3c . B

The reason for this smaller value is mostly due to the smaller pKa of Q3c compared to that of Glu-L212. B The relative energy levels for proton transfer from the surface bound acid to Glu-L212 is shown in Fig. 3. This energy landscape is determined by the free energies of protonation for the individual groups. The pKa of Glu-L212 in the double His mutant RC was determined from the pH titration of the ð1Þ slower proton-limited phase of kAB . This gave a value of 8.5 for pKa (Glu-L212) [24]. The pKa of the intermediate acceptor group is given approximately by the pKa at which the Bronsted plot changes slope, which occurs at V4. (There is « a slight correction of V1 unit to this value, discussed in [28].) The pKa of 6.8 of the surface His was obtained from a study of the pH dependence of Cd2þ binding to the native RC [30], a technique that had been applied to other systems [31,32]. Thus, we can summarize the transfer in two steps. The ¢rst step is the fast reversible proton transfer from the bound protonated imidazole to A3 , which is unfavorable by V240 meV. This is followed by an V330 meV favorable proton transfer from AH to Glu-L212 (Fig. 3). These proton transfer rates are roughly the same as those observed in the extensively studied carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme [33,34] even though proton transfer in the RC occurs î î over a longer distance of V20 A compared to V10 A for CA. The fast rate over the longer distance is due to the intermediate state(s) which breaks the reaction into two (or more) shorter proton transfer steps. In this work, we assume, for

The potential proton transfer pathway leading to Q3c is B shown in red and magenta, the branch leading to Glu-L212 in blue. Q3c was placed at the location found in the native RC. The structure of B the neutral QB state was determined and was found to be at the same location as that for QB in the native RC. Key amino acid residues are shown (labeled in magenta). Shown is the electron density (in blue at 1.5 c) for the new position of Glu-H173 (labeled in green) and three water molecules, proposed to be the functionally important changes. These water molecules, located nearby at positions not observed in the native structure, could provide bridges to and from Glu-H173 in the revertant structure. Other pathways, including one through L210 and its nearby water molecules, are longer but still possible (not shown).

simplicity, only one intermediate state A, although other, as yet unresolved states, may exist. 5. Proton transfer in revertant RCs lacking Asp-L213 A key amino acid in the native RC of Rb. sphaeroides is Asp-L213 [19^21]. Its replacement with Asn [DN(L213)] decreases the proton transfer rates V106 -fold (pH 7.5) resulting in a photosynthetically incompetent RC [35]. It was shown that substitution of Asn-M44 by Asp suppressed this e¡ect [36,37]. Being structurally close to Ser-L223, it was proposed that Asp-M44 could substitute for the missing carboxylate at L213. This also provided an explanation for the lack of sequence conservation of Asp-L213 in di¡erent photosynthetic bacterial species. Several species (e.g. Blastochloris viridis) have Asn at the homologous location of L213 and Asp at the homologous location of M44 [36,37]. However, additional photosynthetic revertants obtained by several groups [35,38] revealed second site suppressor mutations that do not re-introduce a carboxylic acid, e.g. Arg-M233CCys or ArgH177CHis. In these two cases, the rates of proton transfer have been increased s 104 -fold from that of DN(L213). To understand the structural basis of the increase in proton transfer, the crystal structures of the mutants were determined [39]. We will focus on some details of the structure of the revertant with the M233 suppressor mutation which was obî tained to a resolution of 1.8 A. Several observations suggest that the suppressor mutation itself is not likely to be directly involved in the new proton transfer pathway that circumvents the Asn-L213. First, the mutation results in the replacement of Arg with Cys, which is not a proton transfer component. î Second, the site of the suppressor mutation is located s 10 A from the parental L213 mutation and the QB catalytic site. However, the M233 mutation results in structural rearrangements of Glu-H173 and the incorporation of new water molecules near L213 and the QB region (Fig. 4). The changes to Glu-H173 are also found in the structure of the H177 revertant even though the structure near M233 di¡ers. Thus, we propose that the reorientation of Glu-H173 and incorporation of the new water molecules near L213 are the functionally relevant changes. The entry point for proton uptake was identi¢ed to be at or near the same location as in the native RC by the similar inhibitory e¡ect of binding of Cd2þ [40]. Since the structure shows this region to be the same in the revertant and native RCs, the Cd2þ should bind to this region in the revertant RCs. Additional support for the binding location of the Cd2þ comes from the similar pH dependence of KD which shows the involvement of titrable ligands that have essentially the same pKa values as His-H126 and His-H128 in the native RC. Thus, the entry point for proton transfer is located near His-H126 and His-H128. Given the de¢ned starting points near His-H126 and His-H128 and ending points at GluL212 and Q3c , potential proton transfer pathways could be B identi¢ed. The most likely pathways are similar to those found in the native RC with Glu-H173 being a likely replacement for the missing Asp at L213. Important for the involvement of Glu-H173 are three water molecules that provide connectivity between Glu-H173 and the oxygen atoms of Q3c and AspB L210 which is connected to the proton entry point. Thus, although neither suppressor mutation re-introduces a carboxylic acid, the resultant structural rearrangements allow an

alternative acid, Glu-H173, to become part of the new proton transfer pathway. Studies of revertant systems like these provide a means of identifying crucial features for fast proton transfer. Of primary importance in the RC system is the identi¢cation of the altered proton transfer pathway and the concomitant delineation of the importance of Glu-H173 in proton transfer. Another important aspect is the relation between the proton transfer rate constant (i.e. the e¡ectiveness) and the details of the altered proton transfer pathways. Given the altered proton transfer pathways, the rates are not likely to be the same. It would be important to determine the rate constants to relate to the revertant structures.
