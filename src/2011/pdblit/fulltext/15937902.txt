ABSTRACT When classical, Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE)-based approaches fail, it is possible, given high-resolution structures of the free molecules, to model the structure of a complex in solution based solely on chemical shift perturbation (CSP) data in combination with orientational restraints from residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) when available. RDCs can be incorporated into the docking following various strategies: as direct restraints and/or as intermolecular intervector projection angle restraints (Meiler et al., J Biomol NMR 2000;16:245­252). The advantage of the latter for docking is that they directly define the relative orientation of the molecules. A combined protocol in which RDCs are first introduced as intervector projection angle restraints and at a later stage as direct restraints is shown here to give the best performance. This approach, implemented in our information-driven docking approach HADDOCK (Dominguez et al., J Am Chem Soc 2003;125:1731­ 1737), is used to determine the solution structure of the Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin, for which chemical shift mapping, RDCs, and 15N-relaxation data have been previously obtained (Varadan et al., J Mol Biol 2002;324:637­ 647). The resulting structures, derived from CSP and RDC data, are cross-validated using 15 N-relaxation data. The solution structure differs from the crystal structure by a 20° rotation of the two ubiquitin units relative to each other. Proteins 2005;60:367­381. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: protein complexes; chemical shift perturbation; residual dipolar couplings; docking; diffusion anisotropy; di-ubiquitin INTRODUCTION In this post-genomic era, biochemical research focuses more and more on proteomics. Recent advances in highthroughput methods have provided a first glimpse of the overall structure of protein­protein interaction networks in biological systems (for a review, see ref. 1 and references therein) and promise to contribute increasingly to our understanding of how proteins cooperate. Most proteins achieve their function by interacting with other proteins and forming an active complex. The struc©

ture determination of such complexes by X-ray and/or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) still presents a challenging task. Because of that, ab initio protein­protein docking is becoming increasingly popular (for a review, see ref. 2). Recently, the CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) experiment3 provided a blind test of the performance of different docking approaches (see http://capri.ebi.ac.uk). Although it is clear that considerable progress has been made in recent years, it is also obvious that docking based only on shape complementarity and/or a general force field, without any auxiliary information, is still very challenging. Reasonable solutions can be obtained, however, when a small amount of experimental information is included. We recently developed an information-driven method called HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein­protein DOCKing) to dock proteins using biochemical and/or biophysical data, such as mutagenesis data or the easily available chemical shift perturbation (CSP) data from NMR titration experiments.4 Such information allows one to map the residues at the interface of the constituents of the complex and can be used to define so-called ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking. Here the ambiguity refers to the fact that residues can be identified to be located at the interface, but that there is no explicit knowledge on the specific pairwise interactions that residues from one component form with residues from the other component. In defining the ambiguous interaction restraints, one distinguishes between two types of residues: active residues that have been experimentally identified and passive residues that correspond to surface neighbors of active residues. AIRs are defined between each active residue of one component and all passive and all active residues of the other component. The use of passive residues, which introduces some fuzziness

in the definition of the interface, is required to account for the fact that not all interface residues can typically be experimentally identified. For example, not all interacting residues in a complex show significant CSPs in NMR titration experiments. The reverse is also true: sometimes residues that are not part of the interface do show significant CSPs as a result of propagated effects, such as a weakening of hydrogen bond strength by a slight -sheet opening or small conformational changes. The use of a solvent accessibility criterion allows one to filter out some of these "false positive" residues. Classically, NMR-structure determination is completed in a lengthy process of collecting and assigning Nuclear Overhauser Effects (NOEs), representing short-range interproton distances. During the last few years, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and 15N-relaxation have been shown to be very useful sources of long-range structural information.5­10 In contrast to NOEs, RDCs and relaxation rates provide orientational information, which is of a global character. For complexes, one way to use this orientational information is to extract from the measured RDCs or relaxation rates for each component the alignment or diffusion tensor of the whole molecule. When the eigenvalues of the tensor of interest are equal for all components of the complex, this strongly indicates that the individual proteins orient or tumble together as a single rigid entity. Then, by rotating the individual components such that their alignment or diffusion tensors become collinear, the orientation of the individual molecules with respect to each other can be obtained.11­14 Some ambiguity, however, typically remains because of the intrinsic degeneracy of RDC and relaxation data and the lack of information about the relative positioning of the molecules. When, in addition, a limited number of intermolecular NOE-derived distances can be used, the structure of the complex can be solved. This approach has been demonstrated for a variety of systems such as RNA,15 protein­ RNA,16 and protein­protein complexes.17 More recently, approaches have emerged that do not use NOEs but rely on chemical shift mapping to determine the interface, with the advantage that weak and transient complexes can be studied in this way. Our HADDOCK approach, which we described above, makes use of such information. CSP information can also be combined with RDCs to refine the relative orientation of the components. It has been previously shown that by combining restraints from CSPs with orientational restraints from RDCs, the structure of a complex can be determined quite accurately;18 the CSP restraints were taken into account by minimizing the difference between experimental and simulated CSPs using the program SHIFTS.19 In another study, the chemical shift mapping data were transformed into a set of highly ambiguous intermolecular distance restraints, as proposed in HADDOCK, and combined with orientational restraints from RDCs.20 RDC and CSP data have also been used a posteriori to filter solutions obtained from ab initio docking21 with the program FTDOCK.22 RDCs are typically used directly as restraints in structure calculation methods by defining an external align-

ment tensor and back-calculating the RDC values from the angle between the internuclear vector of interest and the alignment tensor. In the case of complexes, the orientation of each component is optimized with respect to a single alignment tensor. In this way, the restraints only indirectly define the relative orientation of the components. It has been shown that, by combining RDCs in a pairwise manner, it is possible to define intervector projection angle restraints that become independent of an external alignment tensor. The latter is thus no longer needed in structure calculations.23 These angular restraints have the advantage that they can be introduced in the initial steps of structure calculation starting from random conformations. Such an approach has, until now, never been used for docking. From a computational point of view, it should have some definite advantages. By combining RDCs from the individual components, intermolecular projection angle restraints can be generated that directly define the relative orientation of the components and can be distinguished from the intramolecular components. The use of such restraints should provide an easy way to use data from different alignment media together or to combine RDC restraints with other orientational information, such as relaxation anisotropy restraints.24 In this article we show that the structure of complexes can be efficiently determined from a combination of CSP data and RDCs using a combined approach in which the latter are first introduced as intermolecular intervector projection angle restraints and, at a later refinement stage, as direct restraints. The resulting models are independently validated using 15N-relaxation data. This allows one to assess the possible influence of conformational averaging on the calculated structures, since the timescales for the relaxation data differ from that for the RDCs. This approach is applied in order to determine the solution structure of the Gly76-Lys48 linked di-ubiquitin chain (Ub2) for which NMR CSPs, RDCs and relaxation data have been obtained previously.25 The ubiquitin proteasomal pathway is the major mechanism of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells, and Lys48-linked tetra-ubiquitin (Ub4) is the minimum signal required for efficient targeting of proteins to proteasomes.26 ­28 Knowledge of the structure of polyubiquitin could provide useful insights into the mechanisms of its interaction with various chain recognition factors of the proteasome. At present, there is one crystal structure of a Lys48-linked Ub2 (accession number: 1AAR)29 and two crystal structures of Lys48-Ub4 (accession numbers: 1F9J30 and 1TBE31) in the Protein Data Bank,32 all obtained at acidic pH ( 4.5). These structures differ from each other in the relative orientation and contacts between Ub units. In order to characterize the solution conformation of polyubiquitin, Lys48-linked Ub2 and Ub4 and Lys63-linked Ub2 were recently investigated using a combination of NMR techniques, including chemical shift mapping, 15N-relaxation and RDC measurements.25,33 It was found that Lys48-linked chains exhibit a pH-dependent conformational switch from an open (at pH 4.5) to a closed form (pH 6.8 and higher). In the closed conformation observed under near-physiological conditions in solution, the relative orientation of the two monomers with respect to each

other was found to be distinct from that in the crystal structure. However, no interdomain NOEs could be reliably detected, probably due to conformational exchange broadening of the amide signals from the interface residues. Therefore, no solution structure of Ub2 was generated, because the relaxation- and RDC-derived orientational restraints alone do not provide information on the relative positioning of the two domains. Here we show, using the previously collected NMR data25 at pH 6.8, that the combination of intermolecular intervector projection angle restraints derived from RDC data and AIRs derived from CSP data can be used to determine the first solution structure of Lys48-linked Ub2. The 15N-relaxation data are used for cross-validation of our structure. Finally, the solution structure of Ub2 generated in this way is compared to the crystal structure obtained at pH 4.5. MATERIAL AND METHODS Docking Protocol The original HADDOCK protocol is described in ref. 4. It uses AIRs defined from CSP obtained in NMR titration experiments. The protocol consists of three consecutive stages (for details, see ref. 4): (i) Randomization of orientations followed by rigid body energy minimization (EM); (ii) Semi-flexible simulated annealing in torsion angle space (TAD-SA), which consists of (ii-a) a rigid body molecular dynamics search and first simulated annealing, (ii-b) a second semi-flexible simulated annealing during which side chains at the interface are free to move, and (ii-c) a third semi-flexible simulated annealing during which both side chains and backbone at the interface are free to move; and (iii) Final refinement in Cartesian space with explicit solvent. The docking was performed starting from the 10 conformations in the NMR ensemble [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1D3Z] and from the two Ub monomers taken from the crystal structure of Ub2 (PDB entry 1AAR) following the standard HADDOCK protocol. These 12 starting conformations resulted in 144 pairwise combinations for docking. In the initial rigid-body docking phase, 1440 structures were generated (each combination being used 10 times), and the best 200 in terms of total intermolecular energy were further submitted to the semi-flexible simulated annealing and final water refinement. After water refinement, the resulting structures were clustered based on root mean square deviation (RMSD), and the lowest energy structures from the lowest energy cluster were selected; clustering was completed with a 1.5 Å cutoff using the backbone RMSD of both proteins calculated after positional least square fitting on the first protein only.

Here Aa is the axially symmetric part of the alignment tensor, equal to [Azz 1/2(Axx Ayy)] and Ar is the rhombic component of the alignment tensor, equal to (Axx Ayy), where Axx, Ayy and Azz are the x, y and z-components of the alignment tensor, respectively; i and i are the azimuthal and polar angles of the vector for which the RDC is reported, in the frame of the alignment 0 i jh tensor; D0 21.7 kHz is the strength 3 4 2 2rNH of the (static) dipolar coupling in the NH-pair; rNH is the length of the NH-vector; o is the magnetic permeability of vacuum; i is the gyromagnetic ratio of spin i; and h is Planck's constant. In order to use RDCs for structure calculation, the alignment tensor components need to be determined. This was completed by back-calculating RDCs based on the known structure of the single domains (10 NMR structures and two monomers from the crystal structure) and optimizing the tensor parameters, using the software Pales34 with the option ­ bestFit (which uses singular value decomposition). This fitting procedure was performed separately for the RDC data measured for the distal and proximal domains, leading to 24 sets of tensor parameters. Only RDCs from residues located in secondary structure elements were used (50 in total). We then selected the tensor parameters from the structure and RDC data of the domain with the lowest Q-factor. Experimental RDCs were introduced in the standard HADDOCK protocol in three different ways: (a) directly, using a floating alignment tensor (SANI35 energy term in CNS36); (b) as intervector (NH-NH) projection angle restraints (VEAN23 energy term in CNS); and (c) as a combination of (a) and (b). In the last case, VEAN was used in stages (i) and (ii) of the docking protocol (rigid-body docking and semi-flexible SA), and SANI was used in stage (iii), the final water refinement. The values of the force constants in the protocol are given in Table I. The use of RDCs as direct restraints in structure calculations is described in ref. 35. The use of RDCs as intermolecular intervector projection angle restraints is described in ref. 23; however, since it is less commonly used, we will describe it again in the following section.

D0 Ayy and D0 Azz, respectively. Generally, two minima are allowed, due to the well-known degeneracy of the dependency of the RDC on i and i, and correspondingly, there are four boundary values for ij, denoted ijext1 to ij ext4 in eq. (2). Two force constants must be defined, one for the border potential function (kborder) and one for the central part between the two minima (kcentre). The generation of intermolecular intervector projection angle restraints was implemented in a slightly modified version of a python script (dipolar_segid.py) kindly provided by Drs. Helen Mott and Wayne Boucher (Cambridge University). This script is distributed with the HADDOCK package (see www.nmr.chem.uu.nl/haddock). NMR Data The NMR data used in this study include RDC values for backbone amides, 15N-relaxation rates R1 and R2 and steady-state 1H-15N NOEs. Ub2 chains were assembled from unlabeled and U-15N labeled Ub units, such that only one of the two Ub domains was 15N labeled in each NMR sample. The NMR studies were conducted at pH 6.8. The details of chain assembly and experimental NMR procedures have been presented elsewhere.25 The overall average levels of R1 in the distal Ub appeared to be slightly elevated (6.5%) compared to those in the proximal domain, while the R2 values showed the opposite tendency. This indicates a slight difference in the apparent overall rotational correlation time that could be attributed to interdomain mobility in Ub2. It is also possible that small variations in protein concentration between NMR samples, in which the distal or the proximal domain in Ub2 was isotope labeled, contribute (due to aggregation effects) to the observed differences in the relaxation rates between the domains. Ub2 showed some tendency to aggregate at NMR concentrations ( 1 mM), as inferred from the observed concentration dependence of spin relaxation rates. Note that varying protein concentration can affect the viscosity of the sample (hence the relaxation rates); however, at these low ubiquitin concentrations, this effect is expected to be negligible. Although the relaxation measurements for these studies were performed at Ub2 concentrations as low as 250 ­500 M, some amount of aggregation could still be present. Note that the sub-nanosecond local backbone dynamics in both Ub domains are very similar to

each other and to those in the monomeric Ub.38 In order to be able to fit the experimental data for both domains simultaneously, relaxation rates for the distal domain were uniformly rescaled as follows: R2 3 R2 1.065, R1 3 R1/1.065. This scaling factor represents an average value of the ratio of R2 values between the proximal and the distal domains and of the inverse ratio of R1 values for these domains. Analysis of the diffusion tensor data showed that this procedure mostly affects the principal values but not the orientation of the diffusion tensor. This is further supported by the agreement between the orientation of the diffusion tensors derived from these data and calculated from hydrodynamic properties of the Ub2 structures (Supplementary Material). The analysis of the experimental data using ROTDIF38,39 was performed including core residues, identified as those belonging to Ub secondary structure, excluding six NH groups (residues 7,23,25,48,70,71) in the distal and seven (residues 23,25,48,56,68,70,71) in the proximal Ub that show conformational exchange broadening or could not be reliably evaluated from the spectra due to signal overlap. We also performed a similar analysis including most of the NH vectors except for those mentioned above and those in the 1/ 2 loop and in the C-terminus. The results of these analyses were very similar in terms of the derived diffusion tensor characteristics. Only the "core"residue results are presented here. The ROTDIF program determines the overall rotational diffusion tensor of a 1 2R2 molecule from the ratio of the rates of 1 R1 15 N longitudinal and transverse relaxation, R1 and R2 ; the prime indicates that these rates are modified by subtracting the contributions from high-frequency components of the spectral density.40,41 Note that this ratio, , is independent, to the first approximation, of the site-specific values of the 15N CSA tensor and of the backbone order parameters. The tensor derivation is based on the minimization of the target function

under accession code 2BGF, together with the various NMR restraints used for the docking. Analysis of Intermolecular Contacts Intermolecular contacts (hydrogen bonds and nonbonded contacts) were analyzed with DIMPLOT, part of the LIGPLOT software,43 using the default settings (3.9 Å heavy-atom distance cutoff for non-bonded contacts; 2.7 and 3.35 Å proton-acceptor and donor-acceptor distance cutoffs respectively with minimum 90° angles (D-H-A, H-A-AA, D-A-AA) for hydrogen bonds. A contact is defined to be present in the solution structure if it is found in at least four of the 10 best structures. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To compare the performance of using RDCs as direct restraints or as intermolecular intervector projection angle restraints, the NMR solution structure of the Gly76-Lys48 linked Ub2 was first calculated in three different manners with HADDOCK:4 (i) using solely CSP data, (ii) using CSP data in combination with direct RDC restraints, and (iii) using CSP data in combination with intermolecular intervector projection angle restraints derived from RDC data (see Material and Methods). These three runs will be denoted in the following as (i) CSP, (ii) SANI, and (iii) VEAN, respectively (SANI and VEAN refer to the energy terms in CNS36). Analysis of the results led us to define a protocol termed VEAN-SANI, in which both approaches are combined, using first the intervector projection angle restraints to drive the docking and then the direct RDC restraints for the final explicit solvent refinement. In cases where ambiguity is present in the experimental data, different orientations can be obtained by docking, which should then be distinguished based on energetic considerations, as shown previously.4 To assess the performance and convergence of the various protocols presented here, we therefore compare the populations of the lowest energy clusters. Restraints Definition The restraints that were used are listed in Table II. The ubiquitin monomers, which are linked to one another via a Gly76OLys48 isopeptide bond, are designated distal (D: containing Gly76) and proximal (P: containing Lys48 and a free C-terminus), respectively. For both distal and proximal domains, the active and passive residues used in the docking were defined using the procedure described previously:4 the residues with combined 1H and 15N CSP above average (0.033 ppm) whose backbone or side chain showed more than 50% relative solvent-accessible surface area were defined as active residues. Their solvent-accessible surface neighbors were defined as passive residues. From the list of active and passive residues for both monomers, 21 AIRs were defined with an upper distance bound of 2 Å. Two sets of each 46 NH-RDCs (for the distal and proximal domains) were available. As starting structures, we used the 10 models from the NMR structure of ubiquitin (1D3Z) and the two units of the Ub2 X-ray structure

The ubiquitin monomers, which are linked to one another via a Gly76 ­Lys48 isopeptide bond, are designated distal (D: containing Gly76) and proximal (P: containing Lys48 and a free C- terminus), respectively. Our docking protocol uses active residues [interface residues defined based on experimental CSP data (see text)] and passive residues (surface neighbors of active residues). Ambiguous interaction restraints, AIRs, are defined from each active residue of one domain to all active and passive residues of the other domain, using a 2 Å upper distance bound. c Flexible segments are the parts of the molecules that are free to move during the SA stage ii-b and ii-c (see text). These are typically defined as all active and passive residues plus two sequential neighbors. d Fully flexible segments are the parts of the molecules that are free to move during all SA stages (see text). e One docking run was performed using only Chemical Shift Perturbation data (CSP). RDCs were used either as direct restraints (SANI) or as intervector projection angle restraints (VEAN), in both cases combined with CSP. The final protocol consists of a combination of VEAN and SANI together with CSP (VEAN-SANI); see text for details. f The distal and proximal domains are connected via an isopeptide bond between Gly76 carbonyl C and Lys48 NZ; in the docking this is represented as a set of distance restraints based on typical distances for this bond in the crystallographic structure.

(1AAR). For each of those 12 starting structures, the principal components of the alignment tensor were calculated using Pales34 for each RDC set independently. For this, only residues located in secondary structure elements were considered (50 for the two units together). The goodness of fit was assessed with the RDC Q-factor.42 Model 8 from the NMR ensemble, fitted to the RDC data for the distal domain, gave the lowest Q-factor (Q 0.21; R 0.96); the resulting principal component values (Axx 32.3 10 5, Ayy 38.3 10 5, Azz 70.6 10 5; Aa 5 105.9 10 , and Ar 6.02 10 5) were used subsequently in the structure calculations. The RDC data were introduced either as direct restraints (92 in total) with explicit inclusion of an alignment tensor (SANI) or as intervector projection angle restraints (VEAN). The latter were defined by taking pairwise combinations of the total set of 92 RDCs and selecting only the intervector projection angle restraints restricting at least 25% of the conformational space. In this way, 981 inter-domain and 972 intra-domain restraints were defined. Furthermore, four unambiguous restraints were introduced to represent the covalent isopeptide bond from Gly76 of the

distal domain to Lys48 of the proximal domain. This approach was chosen instead of defining a covalent bond to allow for randomization of the starting orientations and to facilitate the docking. Docking From CSP Figure 1 shows the intermolecular energies of the water-refined solutions as a function of the RMSD from the lowest energy structure of the respective runs. The 200 solutions after final refinement in explicit water were clustered using a 1.5 Å pairwise RMSD cutoff, and clusters were ranked using the average intermolecular energies calculated for the 10 lowest-energy structures. In this way, different cluster sizes do not affect the ranking. After clustering, the lowest energy structure(s) of the lowest energy cluster were taken as the best docking solution. The lowest energy cluster for the CSP docking has 39 members. As shown in Table III, the Q-factor for this run is relatively high (0.64 0.07), indicating that those structures do not satisfy the RDC restraints.

The VEAN restraints consist of 981 inter- and 972 intra-molecular restraints.

The CSP-structures are quite similar to the crystal structure, with an average backbone RMSD from it of 1.0 Å (Table IV). The crystal structure itself has a Q-factor of 0.44, which indicates that it is also not consistent with the experimental RDCs. Docking From CSP and Intermolecular Intervector Projection Angle Restraints (VEAN) As is clear from Figure 1(b), the VEAN run has a very good convergence; the lowest energy cluster is highly

populated with 107 members. Note that the energies in Figure 1 contain the restraint energies (AIR, VEAN, SANI), which explains why they differ between the various runs. The corresponding VEAN structures have a better Q-factor (0.35 0.03) than the CSP-only structures and the crystal structure. As can be seen in Table III, the number of direct RDC (which were not used) or intervector projection angle restraint violations is lower than for the crystal or the CSP-only docked structure. The structures differ from the CSP structures

(backbone RMSD from average CSP structure of 1.5 0.3 Å) and from the crystal structure (backbone RMSD of 2.4 0.5 Å). These differences are larger than the spread within the ensemble of 10 structures (see Table IV). Docking From CSP and Direct RDC Restraints (SANI) Figure 1(c) shows that the SANI run does not converge as well as the VEAN run; there are only 65 structures in the lowest energy cluster. The Q-factor is low, 0.14 0.01, which indicates excellent agreement with the experimental RDC data. Table III shows that the SANI structures have less direct RDC violations than the VEAN structures but more intervector projection angle restraint violations (although still less than the CSP-only docked structures or the crystal structure). This indicates that the two kinds of RDC restraints do not define or restrict the orientation of the N-H vectors in a fully similar way. The average backbone RMSD of the SANI structures from the crystal structure is 1.6 0.3 Å and from the average CSP structure 1.4 0.3 Å. Comparison of Direct RDC (SANI) and Intervector Projection Angle (VEAN) Run The VEAN structures and the SANI structures are both more consistent with the experimental RDC data than the crystal structure or the CSP structures. Still, there are differences between those structures, reflected in an average backbone RMSD from the mean of VEAN from SANI of 1.0 0.2 Å. To compare the consistency of both sets of structures with the RDC data in more detail, a histogram of the differences between calculated and observed RDCs is presented in Figure 2. Both runs show a Gaussian-like distribution around a mean value of 0, but the distribution for SANI is tighter than the one for VEAN. The maximum violation in SANI is 4.2 Hz, which, considering the 50-Hz range of the measured RDCs, is below 10% of the experimental values. Note also that we are using a flat bottom harmonic potential for the RDCs that allows larger deviations from experimental values than the often used purely harmonic potential. Final Protocol: Docking With CSP and A Combination of VEAN and SANI From the results described above it is clear that VEAN has the advantage of better convergence (107 versus 65

structures for SANI in the lowest energy cluster), but SANI shows better consistency with the experimental RDC data. To combine these advantages, we defined a protocol in which we used intervector projection angle restraints (VEAN) in the first two stages of our docking protocol (rigid body EM and semi-flexible SA) and direct RDC restraints (SANI) in the final water refinement (for details, see Material and Methods); we refer to this as VEAN-SANI. In Figure 1(d), it can be seen that the convergence of this protocol is comparable to that of VEAN; the lowest energy cluster is the most highly populated with 129 members. Moreover, the structures satisfy the RDC restraints as well as the SANI structures: the Q-factor for the best 10 structures after water refinement is 0.15 0.01; see also Table III and Figure 2. The structures have an average backbone RMSD from the average structure of 1.0 0.3 Å to VEAN and 0.9 0.2 Å to SANI, respectively. These differences are within the precision of the respective ensembles, indicating that the various structures calculated using RDCs (SANI, VEAN, and VEAN-SANI) are to a large extent similar.

cording to the differences between experimental and calculated RDCs. From these data, it is clear that our solution structure has a much better consistency with the RDC data. It can also be seen that the deviations in the crystal structure are not only present in loop regions but also in secondary structure elements, indicating that it is unlikely that they could originate from intramolecular flexibility only. Validation Using 15N-Relaxation Data As an independent validation of the Ub2 structures, we determined how well they agree with the 15N-relaxation data. The crystal structure of Ub2 and the ten final Ub2 structures of each run were used as input for the computer program ROTDIF25,38,39 that fits relaxation data to a fully anisotropic rotational diffusion model. The experimental data were also fitted for each domain separately, as controls. The results are summarized in Table V; details are presented in the Supplementary Material. The orientation of the principal axes of the diffusion tensor with respect to the molecule is very similar in the SANI, VEAN, and VEAN-SANI ensembles (see Fig. 4). The CSP structures and the crystal structure resulted in a somewhat different orientation of the diffusion tensor, consistent with the different interdomain orientation for these two structures. It is worth mentioning that the Ub2-diffusion tensor orientation derived from 15N-relaxation data is in reasonable agreement with the tensor orientation predicted solely from hydrodynamics properties of our solution structures using HYDRONMR44 (Supplementary Material). We have also compared the orientation of the diffusion tensor axes of Ub2 obtained from fitting both domains simultaneously with those derived from fitting each individual domain alone. For a proper alignment of the domains in a molecule, these three sets of axes should agree with each other. There is excellent agreement between the "both-domains"-axes and those for the proximal domain in all NMR-derived structures (Table V). For the distal domain, the agreement is very good for the VEANSANI ensemble, while there is a somewhat greater variation in the axes' orientation for the other structures, with CSP showing the least agreement. Note that the diffusion tensor for the distal domain appears more axially symmetric,25 and therefore the orientation of its x- and y-axes (given by the angle ) is less well defined, resulting in a greater variation in the angle among the structures. To better assess the agreement between the orientations of the diffusion tensors, we also determined the angles between the corresponding axes for every structure in each ensemble (Supplementary Material). The average values of the intervening angle between the z-axes of the diffusion tensors ("both-domains" vs. "distal-only") were 6 2° (VEAN-SANI), 8 1° (SANI), 8 3° (VEAN), and 14 5° (CSP), while the corresponding angles between the "bothdomains" and the "proximal-only" diffusion tensors were 5 1° (VEAN-SANI), 4 1° (SANI), 7 5° (VEAN), and 13 6° (CSP). A comparison between the axes of the "distal-only" and the "proximal-only" diffusion tensors

gives for the same intervening angle 9 3° (VEAN-SANI), 10 1° (SANI), 13 6° (VEAN), and 24 9° (CSP). For the crystal structure, the z-z angles were 14, 16, and 28° respectively. The structures were then compared in terms of the residuals of fit, represented by the value of the target function, 2 (Table V). The average 2 value per degree of freedom, 2/df, for the core residues was 4.78 0.88 (SD) for CSP, 4.78 0.68 for VEAN, 3.37 0.40 for 0.19 for VEAN-SANI. These values SANI, and 3.34 should be compared with 4.77 for the crystal structure. In order to assess how well the relative orientation of the two domains in the derived structures agrees with the 15 N-relaxation data, we also compared the residuals of fit for Ub2 with the sum of 2 values obtained when fitting the same experimental data for the two Ub domains separately. Such a comparison is necessary because the total 2 could be affected by greater residuals of fit for the individual domains (as e.g. in the case of the distal domain). The ratios of the corresponding 2 values (Table V) indicate that all docked structures are in better agreement with the experimental relaxation data than the crystal structure. A statistical F-test45 comparing the corresponding variances for CSP, VEAN, SANI, and VEAN-SANI, results in F-test values (Table IV, last column) below the critical value of 1.50755 at the 95% confidence level. This suggests that an increase in 2 when fitting both domains according to their relative orientation in a given structure versus fitting them separately is not statistically significant for the docked structures. In comparison, the F-test value for the crystal structure suggests that the observed increase in 2/df could be significant: the probability for such an increase to occur by chance is 0.04. The VEANSANI ensemble, which has the lowest 2/df values, agrees best with the experimental relaxation data. The SANI ensemble is of comparable quality (although it has a higher standard deviation), while the VEAN ensemble is in slightly lesser agreement with the 15N-relaxation data, although it is still somewhat better than the crystal structure and the CSP-only structures. Structural Analysis of Ub2 Solution Structure: Quality of Structure Based on the good convergence, the consistency with the RDC data, and the independent validation with the relaxation data, we conclude that the VEAN-SANI structures are our best representation of the solution structure of Ub2. The final ensemble of the 10 lowest-energy structures is shown in Figure 5. In Table VI, we analyze the solution structure and compare it with the crystal structure (1AAR29). The solution structure has only a small number of violations of AIR restraints and RDC data. This is not true for the crystal structure, which has 10 violations of ambiguous interaction restraints and has a higher Qfactor (see Table III). To make sure that the solutions resulting from the docking with RDC-restraints, while in better agreement with the RDC and relaxation data, are not artificial in the sense that their geometry is worse, we

analyzed the RMSD from idealized covalent geometry and the Ramachandran plot statistics with Procheck.46 As shown in Table VI, the results are satisfactory. Although the crystal structure has a somewhat higher percentage of backbone dihedrals in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, the solution structure is still very good, with 100% of the residues having their backbone dihedrals in the most favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The RMSDs from idealized geometry are also very good, indicating that the additional orientational restraints do not result in local distortions of the covalent geometry. We also investigated whether the improvement in Q-factor for the structures docked using RDC restraints was due to local distortions of

The Q-factor of the structures generated in this way was on average 0.19, compared to 0.15 for the refined structure, indicating again that the use of RDCs does not artificially distort the geometry of the structure (otherwise it would be expected that adding the N-H protons according to standard geometry would give much higher Q-factors).

be sufficient to expose these groups and allow them to interact with other molecules. It was also suggested that the interface in the closed conformation (at pH 6.8, for which we determined the structure here) is somewhat more open than that in the crystal structure. Our solution structure supports this latter conclusion. Specifically, we looked at the percentage of decrease in solvent accessibility (calculated using NACCESS48) observed upon going from the ubiquitin monomer to the Ub2 structure. For Val70 (both distal and proximal domains) there is not much difference between the solution and the crystal structure; for both, the decrease in accessibility is between 95 and 100%. For Ile44 (both distal and proximal domains), in the crystal structure the accessibility decreases by more than 99%, whereas in the solution structure, Ile44 remains a little bit more accessible (decrease in accessibility of 94 7%). The accessibility of Leu8 in the crystal structure is decreased by 65 and 70% for the distal and proximal domains, respectively, compared with only 52 11% and 58 7% for these domains in the solution structure. This shows that in the solution structures these hydrophobic residues are slightly more accessible than in the crystal structure. Note that these data also suggest that the interactions between the functionally important hydrophobic residues (Leu8, Ile44, and Val70) in Ub2 and various recognition factors will involve significant interdomain motions, such as a transition between the closed

structure and crystal structure. This is confirmed by analysis with Dyndom,47 which allows identification and characterization of domain motions. The rotation axis is 40% 10% a twist axis (normal to the interface) and 60 10% a closure axis (parallel to the interface); the rotation around this axis is 20° ( 3°). Figure 6 gives a graphical representation of this rotation; the rotation axis as determined by Dyndom for the representative structure (closest to the mean) of the ensemble is shown, together with this structure and the crystal structure. We also calculated the angle between the helix axes in the distal and proximal domain: this angle is 128° in the crystal structure and 154° ( 6°) in the solution structure. This difference in domain orientation between solution and crystal structure is also reflected in the RMSD value of 1.7 0.3 Å between the two. Structural Analysis of Ub2 Solution Structure: The Interface It was previously shown based on NMR data25,38 that the functionally important residues Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 at the ubiquitin Ub2 interface are not rigidly buried but that some interdomain dynamics are retained that could

conformation (which we study here) and the open conformations of Ub2. We also analyzed the intermolecular contacts using the program DIMPLOT.43 A number of non-bonded contacts were detected that are similar in the solution and the crystal structures. However, there are additional contacts that are specific for the solution structure (see Supplementary Material Table 3S). Figure 7 shows a detailed view of the interface of the solution structure. Discussion The structures obtained by docking using only CSP data satisfied neither RDC nor relaxation data. To some extent, this indicates that applying only CSP data to drive protein­ protein docking should be done with care. However, it is still reassuring that the resulting CSP structures are quite close to the crystal structure (RMSD of 1.0 Å). In our opinion, this shows that the (easily available) CSP data are very valuable to get a fair representation of the solution structure of a protein­protein complex. When introducing RDCs in the docking protocol, both SANI and VEAN gave good and comparable results for Lys48-linked Ub2. In order to get an unbiased account of the way the structures fulfill the experimental RDC data, cross-validation was performed: 10% of the RDC data were excluded from the structure calculations; these data were subsequently used for independent validation. After cross-validation, the values of the Q-factor were 0.48 for SANI and 0.58 for VEAN. This shows that the direct RDC structure and the intermolecular intervector projection angle structure are of comparable quality. However, proper assessment would require full cross-validation. This was not done because it is computationally very expensive. We also checked whether the higher Q-factors of the structures calculated with intervector projection angle restraints compared to those obtained with direct RDC restraints were due to the force constants for the VEAN energy term being too small: we repeated the docking with a value two times larger for the VEAN force constants. This did not result in a better agreement with the experimental data (results not shown), indicating that looser restraining might well be an intrinsic property of this type of restraint: the accumulation of errors when taking pairs of RDCs could lead to less restrictive restraints. The two approaches (SANI and VEAN) were combined, using intervector projection angle restraints in the first stages of the calculations to benefit from better convergence, and direct RDC restraints in the final explicit solvent refinement to fine-tune the structures. The structures calculated with this final protocol better fit the experimental RDC restraints compared to the structures calculated using only CSPs or the crystal structure. This is to be expected since those structures have been optimized against these RDC data. The anisotropic relaxation data provide, however, an independent validation; the structures calculated using the RDCs also better fit those data. It was estimated previously,25 on the basis of RDC and relaxation data, that the angle between the -helices in

the two domains should be between 161° (relaxation data) and 145° (RDC data) for the structure in solution, compared to 128° in the crystal. In agreement with this, the structures obtained here have an average angle between the -helices of 154°. As previously discussed,25,38 the interface in Lys48linked Ub2 is not rigidly locked, which allows ligands to compete with the Ub­Ub interactions.49 A model based on chemical shift titration suggests that at pH 6.8 Lys48linked Ub2 is in dynamic equilibrium between the predominantly populated ( 85%) "closed" state and a minor, "open" state. This equilibrium to some extent represents the on/off events in protein­protein interactions. It is important to note that the so-called "open" state of Lys48linked Ub2 at pH 6.8 is a compact conformation, probably characterized by somewhat weaker interdomain contacts compared to the "closed" state but not very different structurally. This is supported by recent small-angle X-ray scattering data50 that indicate a mono-dispersed compact globular conformation of Lys48-linked Ub2 under similar conditions in solution. From the RDC data alone, it is difficult to determine whether this solution structure at pH 6.8 represents a single static conformation or results from motion averaging of RDCs; a similar problem has been noted in the case of other proteins.14,51 It is not clear to what extent the measured RDCs are affected by the dynamic equilibrium in Ub2. Several interface residues in Ub2 exhibit linebroadening indicative of conformational exchange in a microsecond­millisecond time range,25,38 although it is not possible to determine the amplitudes of these motions from the relaxation data. An estimate of the effect of motions on RDC measurements can be obtained by calculating the `internal generalized degree of order' as proposed by Tolman et al.;52 its value is correlated with possible structural distortions due to dynamics. In our case, for the distal and proximal domains, the values ranged from 0.96 to 1.0, indicating only very small structural distortions due to motion, if any. In addition, independent validation using 15N-relaxation data, which are probing dynamics in a much narrower time range compared to RDCs, clearly indicates that both RDC and relaxation data are affected by motions in Ub2 in approximately the same way. This suggests that whatever conformational averaging is present, it happens primarily on the time scale of the overall rotational diffusion or faster. If dynamic events on a slower time scale would influence the structure calculated here, one would expect a statistically significant increase in the value of 2 when comparing the fits of relaxation data for the distal or proximal domain with di-ubiquitin. However, this is not the case. All this indicates (1) that the conformational equilibrium between open and closed conformations on a slow time scale does not significantly affect the measured RDCs and thus our proposed model and (2) that the value of 15% for the population of the open state is most likely an overestimate. It is not yet possible to rule out the possibility that our structure reflects conformational averaging on a 10 ns or faster time scale.

Our results show that a docking method based on CSP data, HADDOCK,4 can successfully be combined with RDCs following a combined strategy in which RDCs are first introduced as intervector projection angle restraints and at the later refinement stage as direct restraints. The use of intervector projection angles has some definite advantages. First, it leads to a better convergence of the calculations, which in turn gives more confidence in the results, and also means that structural characteristics (like interdomain orientation in our case) can be calculated more precisely because relevant parts of the configuration space are sampled more extensively. The better convergence of the docking run using intervector projection angle restraints could be due to the fact that it is possible to distinguish between intermolecular and intramolecular restraints; by using only the intermolecular restraints in the rigid-body docking phase, it is possible to define directly the relative orientation of the two components. Finally, by avoiding the use of an external tensor in structure calculations, intervector projection angles offer a convenient means to combine RDC data obtained from different alignment media or simultaneously refine structures against both RDCs and relaxation data.
