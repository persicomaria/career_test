Abstract Glutamate-5-kinase (G5K) catalyzes the controlling first step of proline biosynthesis. Substrate binding, catalysis and feed-back inhibition by proline are functions of the N-terminal $260-residue domain of G5K. We study here the impact on these functions of 14 site-directed mutations affecting 9 residues of Escherichia coli G5K, chosen on the basis of the structure of the bisubstrate complex of the homologous enzyme acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK). The results support the predicted roles of K10, K217 and T169 in catalysis and ATP binding and of D150 in orienting the catalytic lysines. They support the implication of D148 and D150 in glutamate binding and of D148 and N149 in proline binding. Proline increases the S0.5 for glutamate and appears to bind at a site overlapping with the site for glutamate. We conclude that G5K and NAGK closely resemble each other concerning substrate binding and catalysis, but that they have different mechanisms of feed-back control.

(a domain named after pseudo uridine synthases and archaeosine-specific transglycosylases) domain [10]. AAK domains bind ATP and a phosphorylatable acidic substrate, and make a phosphoric anhydride [11]. The function of the PUA domain (a domain characteristically found in some RNA-modifying enzymes) [12] is not known. By deleting the PUA domain of E. coli G5K we showed [10] that the isolated AAK domain, as the complete enzyme, forms tetramers, catalyzes the reaction and is feed-back inhibited by proline. We now pursue further structure-function correlations in G5K using site-directed mutagenesis to map substrate-binding and catalytic residues within the AAK domain of the E. coli enzyme. The paradigmatic AAK-family enzyme N-acetyl-L -glutamate kinase (NAGK) was chosen as a model to decide which residues to mutate in G5K, because (1) it is homologous to the G5K AAK domain (Fig. 1B); (2) it catalyzes the same reaction except for the use of N-acetylated glutamate; and (3) there exist high resolution structures of complexes of NAGK with substrates or substrate analogs which mimic different steps of the catalytic cycle [11,13]. We report here the effects of 14 mutations affecting 9 residues of the AAK domain of G5K, shedding light on substrate binding and catalysis by G5K, and supporting the overlap of the site for the feed-back inhibitor, proline, with the site for the substrate glutamate.

1. Introduction Proline accumulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is now believed to be related not only to the functions of proline as a protein amino acid and as a source of energy, carbon and nitrogen, but also as an osmolyte [1­4] and as a potential virulence factor [5­7] known to facilitate bacterial growth at elevated osmolarities [8]. Glutamate is the primary precursor for proline biosynthesis in bacteria [3] and in osmotically stressed plant cells [2,9]. The first and controlling step of the synthesis of proline from glutamate is catalyzed by glutamate-5-kinase (G5K) [3]. This enzyme is feed-back inhibited by proline, and, in Escherichia coli is a homotetramer of a 367 amino-acid polypeptide composed of (Fig. 1A) an N-terminal 257-residue amino acid kinase (AAK) domain and a 110-residue PUA

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site-directed mutagenesis E. coli proB cloning into pET-22b to yield pGKE, and overexpression and purification of G5K have been reported [14]. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the overlapping extension method [15] (Expand High Fidelity PCR System; from Roche), using as template pGKE. In the first PCR step, two overlapping fragments of proB were independently amplified for each mutation, using the common forward outside primer 1 (Table 1) and the reverse mutation-specific primer (even-numbered in Table 1), or using the common reverse primer 2 (Table 1) and the forward mutation-specific primer (odd-numbered in Table 1). After electrophoretic purification of the amplified fragments, the two overlapping fragments for each mutation were mixed and subjected to another round of PCR amplification including in the PCR mixture both outside primers 1 and 2, which introduce, respectively, an NdeI site at the initiator ATG and a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon of proB. The NdeI and BamHI digestedamplified fragments were ligated using T4 ligase (Promega) into the NdeI and BamHI sites of plasmid pET-22b (Novagen). The mutant plasmids, isolated from E. coli DH5a cells (from Clontech) and confirmed to carry the desired mutation by complete DNA sequencing, were used to transform BL21(DE3) cells (from Novagen) and to drive the overexpression of the mutant proteins, which were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2) by the same procedure as for wild-type G5K [14].

Enzyme activity assays G5K activity was assayed at 37 °C as described [10], by measuring ADP release in the presence of 20 mM ATP, 0.15 M Na glutamate and 80 mM MgCl2. When ATP was varied, glutamate was kept at 0.15 M, and MgCl2 was in an excess of 60 mM over ATP. When glutamate was varied, 20 mM ATP and 80 mM MgCl2 were used.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effects of proline on G5K activity G5K activity depends hyperbolically on the concentrations of both ATP and glutamate, but the dependency on glutamate becomes sigmoidal in the presence of proline (Fig. 3A), with a hyperbolic increase in the Hill coefficient with proline concentration, from a value of 1.1 without proline, to 3.6 at infinite proline (Fig. 3B). The SGlu increases linearly with 0:5 proline concentration (Fig. 3B), as expected for competition between proline and glutamate. From the slope of the straight line a K Pro ¼ 89 Æ 3 lM, is estimated, a value $1000-fold lower i than the K Glu in the absence of proline (82 mM, Table 2). Since m

proline triggers much smaller Vmax changes (Fig. 3B), G5K approaches a perfect K allosteric system (in the terminology of Monod et al. [16]). When the glutamate concentration was decreased from 0.15 to 0.05 M, the proline concentrations needed for inhibition were decreased, as expected for competition between glutamate and proline, and the dependency of the activity on proline concentration became less sigmoidal than at higher glutamate (Fig. 3C). 3.2. Preparation of the mutant enzyme forms The mutations introduced here (shown below the G5K sequence; Fig. 1B) affect residues that are either invariant or conservatively replaced in both G5Ks and NAGKs

estimated visually by SDS­PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate­ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)), they were purified similarly to wild-type G5K (Fig. 2), and their CD spectra were indistinguishable from the spectrum of wild-type G5K (data not shown), indicating that they are well folded and reasonably stable. 3.3. Mutations having large effects on catalysis (Table 2) Except the D150A mutant, all the mutants were active, although the activity was 61% of that of wild-type G5K for the mutations affecting K10, N149, D150, D170 and K217. Assays at varying substrate concentrations proved mutations at these residues to decrease very importantly Vmax, and thus to hamper catalysis. Judged from the NAGK crystal structure, this effect was to be expected for mutations affecting K10, K217 and D150, since the corresponding K8 and K217 of NAGK were proposed to catalyze phosphoryl transfer by shielding negative charges in the pentavalent phosphorus transition state and in the ADP b-phosphate, respectively, and D162 of NAGK orients the catalytic amino groups of these lysines by interacting with them through its carboxylate group [11,13]. K8R and D162E mutations were previously shown to decrease Vmax P 100-fold in NAGK [17]. Since the K217R mutation preserves the positive charge on the mutant residue, the exact location of this charge appears crucial, given the mutation large effect in G5K. Similarly the negative charge on D150 appears crucial, as expected for interaction with the positively charged catalytic lysines. Of the other two mutations causing large decreases in Vmax, N149A may trigger its effect indirectly, by altering the position of the crucial adjacent residue D150, but it is unclear how do D170 mutations interfere with catalysis, since the corresponding NAGK residue, D181, merely makes one hydrogen bond with the ribose of ATP [11]. 3.4. Mutations hampering glutamate binding (Fig. 4A and Table 2) D148N and D148A dramatically increased K Glu , preventing m saturation even at 1.2 M glutamate, although the activity of the D148N mutant was at this concentration $40% of wildtype, indicating that the Vmax was little or not affected by this mutation. Assuming normal Vmax, K Glu would be increased m $22- and $2000-fold by the D148N and D148A mutations, respectively, indicating that the side chain of D148 is crucial and that the negative charge on this side chain is important for glutamate binding. The corresponding NAGK residue, N160, is involved in the binding of the acetamido group of acetylglutamate [11] and thus the side-chain of D148 is likely to interact with the amino group of glutamate, contributing to neutralize this group. The carboxylate on D150 may also contribute to such neutralization, since the D150N mutation, in addition to reducing Vmax, increased $13-fold the K Glu . m 3.5. Effects of other mutations (Table 2) T169A and T169S increased K ATP 9- and 3-fold and dem creased V $ 20- and 5-fold, respectively, pointing to a substanmax tial role of the T169 hydroxyl in ATP binding and catalysis, as expected if this residue forms, as its counterpart in NAGK (S180) [11], a donor hydrogen bond with the ATP b-phosphate. The changes triggered by G51A are too small for the intended elimination of a donor hydrogen bond with the

mation of the hydrogen bond was not prevented by the structural disturbance introduced by the mutation, or that G51 does not make such hydrogen bond in G5K. This mutation mimics the effects of a low proline concentration, increasing the SGlu and rendering sigmoidal the glutamate saturation 0:5 kinetics. M214A also triggered less important changes than anticipated for the stacking of the side chain with the adenine ring of ATP [11], as observed in NAGK, suggesting that the role of M214 is either different in G5K, or that other contacts are able to replace the lost contacts in the mutant. 3.6. Effects of the mutations on the kinetic parameters for proline (Fig. 4B and Table 2) None of the mutations abolished inhibition by proline, but mutations D148N and D148A increased $40- and $150-fold, respectively, the proline requirement. Since these mutations also increase much K Glu , D148 appears involved in the binding m of both glutamate and proline, and its negative charge is important for the binding of both ligands. Another mutation, G51A, also increased concomitantly, although much more modestly, both the SGlu and the IPro . These findings, together 0:5 0:5 with the competition between proline and glutamate (see above), strongly suggest that the sites for substrate and inhibitor overlap. The negative charge on D148 may be involved in neutralizing the amino group of glutamate and the imino group of proline. As expected for different ligands, the overlap is incomplete, since N149A increased $14-fold the IPro but did 0:5 not affect substantially the SGlu , and the opposite was true for 0:5 D150N. Mutations T169S, T169A, K217R and K217A decreased one order of magnitude the IPro , but these mutations caused up to 0:5 $15-fold increases in the K ATP , and therefore the decreased m IPro may result from increased sigmoidicity of the glutamate 0:5 dependency of the activity at partial saturation by ATP. 3.7. General discussion The present results support the quality of the alignment of E. coli G5K and NAGK (Fig. 1) and the similarity of substrate

sites and catalytic mechanisms for both enzymes, as illustrated best by the large effects on the Vmax of G5K and NAGK of mutations affecting K10/8 (G5K/NAGK numbering) or D150/162. Our results provide the first direct experimental evidence for the catalytic and ATP binding roles of K217/K217 and T169/S180, and they highlight the important roles in glutamate binding of D148 and D150 of G5K. Nevertheless, the Km values for ATP and glutamate of E. coli G5K are $6-fold higher and $400-fold higher, respectively, than the Km values of E. coli NAGK for the corresponding substrates [17], and, therefore, there must be important although perhaps subtle differences between the substrate sites of both enzymes to justify these differences in apparent affinities. The much higher K Glu of G5K relative to the K AcGlu of NAGK appears well m m adapted to the larger concentrations of glutamate than of acetylglutamate expected to be present in E. coli cells. At the mM range of glutamate concentrations expected to prevail in E. coli [18], proline synthesis ``in vivo'' should be directly proportional to glutamate concentration, and should be nearly abolished by concentrations of proline as low as 0.1 mM. No such potent proline inhibition can occur in plants if these have to synthesize high concentrations of proline under stress conditions [2,9]. Bifunctional G5Ks from plants (incorporating in the same polypeptide G5K and glutamate-5-phosphate reductase) appear to require higher proline concentrations for inhibition than bacterial G5Ks [2,9], but regulatory mechanisms may also exist to increase the threshold for proline inhibition, similarly to what has been recently found for arginine inhibition of the NAGK of photosynthetic organisms [19]. The conclusion of the present work that the sites for the substrate glutamate and for the inhibitor proline overlap, explains why the mutations previously found to decrease the sensitivity of G5K to proline [9] map exclusively in the N-terminal domain of G5K, the domain that hosts the site for glutamate, with clustering of many of these mutations in the vicinity of D148, the residue found here to be crucially involved in binding both glutamate and proline, and it also accounts for the observation of impaired enzyme activity associated with some of the proline-desensitizing mutations [9]. Since in many organisms NAGK is feed-back inhibited by arginine [20,21], proline inhibition of G5K might resemble arginine inhibition of NAGK. In fact, arginine increases the Km for acetylglutamate of arginine-sensitive NAGK [20], similarly to the effect of proline on the S0.5 for glutamate in G5K. However, in NAGK arginine binds in the C-terminal domain, far from the acetylglutamate site, next to an N-terminal kinked a-helix which is crucial for inhibition and which is missing in G5K (judged from sequence comparisons), and the competition between arginine and acetylglutamate results from the favoring by these ligands of alternative enzyme conformations which are, respectively, inactive and active [21]. The inhibition of G5K by proline may resemble more the feed-back inhibition by UTP of another AAK family enzyme, bacterial UMP kinase, in which UTP was found to bind to the UMP site (corresponding to the glutamate site of G5K) [22]. Nevertheless, UTP and UMP are much more similar than glutamate and proline, and therefore it is unclear if in G5K proline simply sits on the glutamate site or whether it inhibits in a more complex way such as by triggering an alternative conformation of the substrate binding site. To clarify these issues and to analyze in more detail the potential relatedness of feed-back regulation in the different enzymes of the AAK family, it appears essential

to determine the 3-D structure of the complex of G5K with proline, a goal that is being actively pursued in our laboratories. While the present paper was under review two structures of G5K, from E. coli, have been deposited in the Protein Databank (2J5T, 2J5V). When the coordinates are released it will be of great interest to assess the E. coli variant enzymes reported here in this new structural context.
