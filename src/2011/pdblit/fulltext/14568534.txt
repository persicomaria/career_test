Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the stereospecific hydroxylation of L -phenylalanine, the committed step in the degradation of this amino acid. We have solved the crystal structure of the ternary complex (hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4·THA) of the catalytically active Fe(II) form of a truncated form (DN1 ­ 102/DC428­ 452) of human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPheOH), using the catalytically active reduced cofactor 6(R)-L -erythro5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and 3-(2-thienyl)-L -alanine (THA) as a substrate analogue. The analogue is bound in the second coordination sphere of the catalytic iron atom with the thiophene ring stacking against ° the imidazole group of His285 (average interplanar distance 3.8 A) and with a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Binding of the analogue to the binary complex hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 triggers structural changes throughout the entire molecule, which adopts a slightly more compact structure. The largest change occurs in the loop region compri° sing residues 131­155, where the maximum r.m.s. displacement (9.6 A) is at Tyr138. This loop is refolded, bringing the hydroxyl oxygen atom of ° Tyr138 18.5 A closer to the iron atom and into the active site. The iron geometry is highly distorted square pyramidal, and Glu330 adopts a conformation different from that observed in the hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4 structure, with bidentate iron coordination. BH4 binds in the second coordination ° sphere of the catalytic iron atom, and is displaced 2.6 A in the direction of Glu286 and the iron atom, relative to the hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4 structure, thus changing its hydrogen bonding network. The active-site structure of the ternary complex gives new insight into the substrate specificity of the enzyme, notably the low affinity for L -tyrosine. Furthermore, the structure has implications both for the catalytic mechanism and the molecular basis for the activation of the full-length tetrameric enzyme by its substrate. The large conformational change, moving Tyr138 from a surface position into the active site, may reflect a possible functional role for this residue.

Introduction
The non-heme iron enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheOH, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1) catalyzes the hydroxylation of the essential aromatic amino acid L -phenylalanine (L -Phe) to L -tyrosine (L -Tyr) in the presence of the specific pterin cofactor 6(R)-L -erythro-5,6,7,8tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and dioxygen. The reaction is the rate-limiting step in the degradation of

to carbon dioxide and water.1 Inborn errors that reduce or destroy the activity of the enzyme are responsible for the human autosomal recessive disease phenylketonuria (PKU)/hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). The disease causes elevated concentrations of L -Phe in the blood, which can impair the normal development of the brain and cause severe mental retardation. In most of Europe, approximately 1 in 10,000 live births reportedly has the disorder2 and more than 400 different mutations are associated with PKU/HPA.3 Most of the mutations are found in the catalytic domain3 and they demonstrate different clinical, metabolic and enzymatic phenotypes.4,5 Recent crystallographic studies on human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPheOH)6 ­ 9 and rat phenylalanine hydroxylase (rPheOH)10 have made it possible to define the structural phenotypes of the different genotypes.11 A limitation in the assignment of the structural phenotypes has been that they have

been based on the structures of catalytically inactive Fe(III) forms of the enzyme, which also lack structural information on substrate binding. Following our recently solved crystal structure of the catalytically active Fe(II) form of the truncated form DN1 ­ 102/DC428 ­ 452-hPheOH and its binary complex with the reduced pterin cofactor (BH4),12 we now present the crystal structure of a ternary complex with the substrate analogue 3-(2-thienyl)-L -alanine (THA). THA is a substrate for rPheOH13 and hPheOH14 and binds competitively to L -Phe at the active site.15 Binding of the substrate analogue also triggers a conformational change similar to that observed upon binding of 14,16,17 L -Phe. The structure reveals the binding sites of the pterin cofactor and the substrate under near-turnover conditions, i.e. in the absence of dioxygen, and provides new insights into the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. It shows that substrate binding triggers a substantial structural change in the catalytic domain, particularly in the active-site region. This change may

Results
Well defined crystals of the binary hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 complex were treated with the substrate analogue THA by adding solid THA to the crystallization drops. The whole procedure of crystallization, post-crystallization diffusion soaking in THA, flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen and mounting of crystals was carried out anaerobically as described.12 When observed in the microscope, the crystals appeared to be unaffected by the THA soaking, but the diffraction pattern revealed a mosaicity that was two to three times higher than that of the "binary" crystals. All three axes of the ° unit cell were 1­ 2 A shorter than for the binary ° complex, and useable data were obtained to 2.5 A. It should be noted, however, that the binary crystals of the enzyme were found to deform/disintegrate when exposed to L -Phe. Data collected for cofactor-free crystals soaked in L -Phe revealed the same high level of mosaicity as that observed for hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4·THA but processing of these data was unsuccessful. The reason why we have been unsuccessful using L -Phe as substrate is not

clear, but does suggest that possible lattice or structural changes may simply have exceeded that tolerable within the crystals. Co-crystallization of hPheOH ­substrate/substrate-analogue complexes using previously known crystallization conditions19 failed, as did experiments to find new crystallization conditions for such a complex. The structure was refined to a final Rwork and Rfree of 22.0% and 26.7%, respectively. The mean error of ° the atomic positions was determined to 0.29 A using the sA method.20 The final model contains 307 residues, a ferrous iron, 39 water molecules, one THA molecule and the reduced cofactor (BH4). The electron density for both THA and BH4 is very good (Figure 1(a) and (b)), as is the electron density for most of the amino acid side-chains with the exception of the loop residues 130 ­ 134 (see below) and a few surface-located side-chains.

All atoms of the substrate analogue THA are well defined, consistent with the low B-factors ° (below 22 A2) estimated during refinement. THA binds in the second coordination sphere of the catalytic iron atom, with the five-membered thiophene ring packing against the imidazole group of the iron ligand His285 (Figures 1(a) and 2) with an ° average interplanar distance of 3.8 A. This distance

is similar to that observed for the phenyl ring of L -Phe in the ternary complex of hPheOH as determined by a combined nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular docking analysis.15 However, the hydrogen bonding pattern of the main-chain THA is somewhat different from that found for L -Phe in that structure. Thus, the amino N forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to ° Tyr277 (3.2 and 3.1 A), and hydrogen bonds to ° ° Thr278 O (2.8 A) and a water molecule (2.8 A), which in turn is hydrogen bonded to Gly346 O ° ° (2.8 A), Glu353 O12 (2.7 A) and possibly Ser350 Og ° ). THA OT1 is hydrogen bonded to Arg270 (3.4 A ° ° Nh1 (3.3 A), Thr278N (3.0 A) and possibly Thr278 ° O (3.1 A) while THA OT2 is hydrogen bonded to ° ° Arg270 Nh2 (2.9 A), Ser349 Og (2.4 A) and possibly Ser349 O. Hydrophobic contacts are formed from ° ° Gly346 Ca (3.8 A) and Phe331 Cz (3.7 A) to THA ° Cd, from Phe331 Cz (3.8 A) to THA C12 and from ° Ser350Cb to THA C (3.5 A) (Figure 2). Binding of the substrate analogue 3-(2-thienyl)L -alanine (THA) triggers large-scale structural changes All previous crystal structures of the binary complexes of the double truncated form ("catalytic domain") of hPheOH8,9,12 can be superimposed onto the non-liganded structure6 (PDB entry 1PAH) with r.m.s. deviations for main-chain atoms ° of between 0.21 and 0.31 A. By contrast, a superposition of the ternary complex hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4·THA onto the non-liganded structure reveals an r.m.s. deviation for main-chain atoms of ° 2.2 A, and superposition onto other hPheOH structures8,9,12 gives similar r.m.s. values. Thus, the ternary complex structure is significantly different from the substrate-free structures and demonstrates that substrate-analogue binding triggers large-scale structural changes. The ternary enzyme is slightly smaller compared to the binary and

ligand-free structures of hPheOH due to a more compact packing. The average atomic distance to ° the centre of mass is 17.9 A for the THA-bound ° structure compared to 18.1 A for the binary and ligand-free structures. The superposition of the ternary hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4·THA complex onto the binary hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 complex12 (PDB entry 1J8U) is shown in Figure 3. In addition to general adjustments throughout the whole structure, part of the chain comprising residues 131 ­155 (mostly loop residues) is substantially refolded. The largest displacement is observed for ° Tyr138 (r.m.s. displacement of 9.6 A). The hydroxyl ° in this residue is displaced by 20.7 A to a partially buried position in the active site (Figure 3), ° with its Oh only 6.5 A away from the iron atom, ° ° 5.7 A away from BH4 C4a and 3.7 A away from THA C11. The phenol ring is packed between ° Leu248 (closest distance 3.6 A) and Val379 (closest ° ) forming a hydrophobic cluster distance 3.4 A (Figure 4), and Tyr138 Oh forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond to a water molecule, which is also hydrogen bonded to O20 in BH4 (Figure 2). In the substrate-free crystal structures of hPheOH,6 ­ 9,12 Tyr138 is located on the surface of the protein with a solvent-exposed side-chain and appears to have no specific importance, except for a possible contribution to protein stability.21 Tyr277 adopts a conformation slightly different from that in the substrate-free structures of hPheOH and its ° hydroxyl oxygen atom is displaced 6.3 A compared with the binary hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4 complex to form a possible water-mediated hydrogen bond with THA N. Displacement of the pterin cofactor upon substrate binding In addition to the large motion of the 131 ­155 region, including the reorientation of Tyr138 from a surface position to a location in the active site, a

significant displacement was observed for the pterin cofactor BH4 (Figures 2 and 5). Iron to pterin (C4a, O4 and N5) distances for all crystal and NMR structures of PheOH and tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOH) are compared in Table 1. The pterin-binding site of the binary hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 is similar to that found in the crystal structure of the binary complex (hPheOH­ Fe(III)·BH2) of hPheOH with the oxidized L -erythro-7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) cofactor (PDB entries 1LRM and 1DMW). The orientation of the pterin cofactor in these two structures is similar to that of the hPheOH ­Fe(III)·BH2·L -Phe NMR and molecular docking structure and the present hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4·THA structure. However, the pterin cofactor is displaced significantly compared to the binary complexes. Superimposing the binary hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 complex on the ternary hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4·THA complex based on conserved active-site residues (His285,

His290 and Fe) revealed a mean displacement of ° 2.6 A for BH4 in the direction of Glu286 and iron upon THA binding (Figure 5). Iron distances are ° shortened from 5.9, 3.8 and 5.7 A for C4a, O4 and N5, respectively, in the crystal structure of binary ° hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4 complex to 4.5, 3.4 and 3.7 A in the current THA ternary structure (Table 1). However, the pterin cofactor is still not coordinated directly to the iron atom. This contrasts with the combined NMR and molecular modeling studies on hPheOH, in which the distance between BH2 O4 and the iron atom was estimated to be ° 2.6 A, and thus compatible with direct coordination to the iron atom.15 However, this NMR/ molecular modeling structure of cofactor and substrate bound at the active site was modeled into the rigid structure of the non-liganded double truncated form of hPheOH and thus did not take into account any bound water molecules or

possible conformational changes in the active site associated with substrate binding. The p-stacking interactions of the cofactor with Phe254 are, however, similar for all three crystal structures of hPheOH pterin complexes. The side-chain of Phe254 in hPheOH­ Fe(II)·BH4·THA is displaced ° about 1.9 A in the same direction as the pterin displacement compared with the binary hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 and hPheOH ­ Fe(III)·BH2 structures, and the average interplanar phenyl-cofactor dis° tance is 3.7 A. The loop residues 247­ 251 form the same pattern of direct hydrogen bonds to the pterin as in the binary hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 and hPheOH ­ Fe(III)·BH2 complexes (except the pterin O20 ­ Ser251 Og bond, which is not present in the published hPheOH ­ Fe(III)·BH2 crystal structure).8 ° These residues are thus displaced about 2.6 A (relative to the active site) in the same direction as the pterin displacement. Glu286 is not displaced significantly and its carbonyl group forms hydrogen bonds directly to N3 and O4 of BH4; these two connections are water-mediated hydrogen bonds in the binary complexes hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 and hPheOH ­Fe(III)·BH2. BH4 C30 forms hydro° phobic contacts with Leu255 Cd1 (3.6 A), Ser 251 ° ° Ca (3.8 A) and Phe254 Cd2 (3.8 A), while BH4 C8a and C7 forms contacts with Leu248 Cd1 (3.7 and ° 3.8 A, respectively). The torsion angle between the hydroxyl groups in the dihydroxypropyl side-chain of BH4 in the ternary complex is similar (2 598) to that in the binary hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4 complex (2 658) and the ternary hPheOH ­Fe(III)·BH2·L -Phe NMR structure (2 608), enabling the BH4 O20 to make a hydrogen bond with the side-chain oxygen atom of Ser251. A crystal structure of the binary ° hPheOH ­ Fe(III)·BH2 complex to 2.1 A resolution (data not shown) was obtained. The electron density maps showed unambiguous positions for all cofactor atoms, including the dihydroxypropyl side-chain, and revealed that the angle between the hydroxyl groups of the side-chain is 2 628. Thus, the same hydrogen bond is formed between ° O20 and Ser251 Og (2.7 A) as for the hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 complex. The ternary complex has a distorted square pyramidal, five-coordinated iron atom Previously determined crystal structures of amino acid hydroxylases6 ­ 10,12,22,23 have shown that the iron ligands are consistently two histidine residues, a monodentate glutamic acid residue

and a varying number of water molecules. The iron atom in the present ternary complex is fivecoordinated by two histidine residues, a bidentate glutamic acid residue, and a single water molecule (Wat2) in a highly distorted square pyramidal geometry with Glu330 O11 as the axial ligand (Figures 1(b) and 2). The ligand ­iron distances are ° ° ° 2.3 A (His285), 2.3 A (His290), 2.6 A (Glu330 O11), ° ° (Glu330 O12) and 2.4 A (Wat2). Both histidine 2.4 A residues and the glutamic acid residue have good electron densities with low B-factors (below 32 ° A2). The water ligand has a slightly higher B-factor ° ° (44 A2) and is displaced about 0.9 A compared to Wat2 in the binary hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 complex. No density appeared for either Wat1 or Wat3, which is in conformity with the 1H NMR studies on full-length hPheOH, suggesting that at least one of the coordinating water molecules is displaced from coordination upon the binding of L -Phe at the active site.24 Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) studies on rPheOH further supports a five-coordinate square pyramidal Fe(II) site upon addition of pterin in the presence of L -Phe.25

Discussion
The present crystal structure of the ternary complex hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4·THA has given valuable new information related to the question of the substrate-binding site, the substrate specificity and the conformational transition (hysteresis) that occurs in the enzyme upon substrate binding. Furthermore, the structure has important implications for the catalytic mechanism and defines clearly the amino acid residues of the active-site crevice structure that are involved in the binding of pterin cofactor and substrate under near-turnover conditions (in the absence of dioxygen) as well as providing a structural explanation for the diseaseassociated PKU/HPA mutations related to these binding sites. The substrate specificity and substratebinding site The substrate specificity of PheOH has been studied extensively by Kaufman.16 For maximum activity, a substrate including an unmodified alanine residue must be attached to an aromatic ring that may contain a number of subsitutions and still be hydroxylated as long as the alanine part is intact. Of particular interest was the finding that

3-(2-thienyl)-L -alanine (THA) is hydroxylated by PheOH14,16 and that this analogue induces a comprehensive global conformational transition (and activation of the enzyme) similar to 14,16,17 L -Phe, although it has a slightly lower affinity of binding than L -Phe.14 Interestingly, recent NMR studies on the double truncated form DN1 ­ 102/ DC428 ­452-hPheOH have demonstrated that L -Phe bound at the active site is displaced by THA.15 Since THA binds competitively to 16,17 L -Phe, the present structure allows us to model the physiological substrate L -Phe into the active site (Figure 6(a)) assuming the position of the main chain of the substrates and the orientation of the ring structure (x1 and x2 angles) to be conserved. In this model, the phenyl group is positioned appropriately in the hydrophobic ° cluster, 3.6 A from the phenyl group of Phe331, ° 3.7 A from the side-chain of Trp326 as well as ° 3.7 A from the Ca atoms of Gly346 and Pro281. The side-chains of Phe331 and Trp326 are both ° ° displaced (about 2 A and 3 A, respectively) upon binding of substrate, resulting in hydrophobic contacts with its phenyl group. Thus, the modeled L -Phe was found to interact with four main residues at the active site, i.e. Arg270, Thr278, His285 and Ser349, as well as with Tyr277, Pro281, Trp326, Phe331, Gly346, Ser350 and Glu353, and interestingly, human missense single-point mutations related to PKU/HPA have been

reported for eight of these residues (Table 2). It should be noted that one of the interactions with Arg270, the interaction with the side-chain of Ser349 and the interactions with Pro281 and His285 are present also in the NMR/molecular docking structure,15 and the displacement of Trp326 to accommodate hydrophobic contacts with L -Phe was predicted in that study, whereas the other observed interactions are unique for the crystal structure. Furthermore, studies on chimeric forms of pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases have revealed that their substrate specificity is determined by the catalytic domain and that none of the chimeric enzymes, containing the catalytic domain of PheOH, were able to hydroxylate 26 L -Tyr. L -meta-tyrosine (L -mTyr), which is a substrate for PheOH,16 was modeled into the binding site in the same manner as L -Phe (see above) (Figure 6(a)). Its hydroxyl oxygen atom could ° form a hydrogen bond (3.0 A) with Tyr138 Oh and ° its nearest carbon atom is Tyr138C11 (3.2 A). On the other hand, when L -Tyr (L -pTyr) was similarly modeled into the active site, its oxygen atom was ° only 2.5 A away from the nearest carbon atom in the side-chain of Trp326. This steric hindrance could be minimized slightly by rotating the sidechain x-values (while conserving the position of the main-chain). The best manual fit was found by rotating x1 , 98, bringing the hydroxyl oxygen

PheOH) mutation showed a 26-fold higher Km value. In the present crystal structure, the Arg270 side-chain forms a salt-bridge with the carboxyl group of THA (and L -Phe), explaining the critical role of this residue in substrate binding. Asp282 does not bind to the substrate, but its carboxyl group forms a salt-bridge with Arg270 and is thus important for substrate binding by providing stability and correct positioning of Arg270. Conformational changes at the active site upon pterin cofactor and substrate binding A comparison of the non-liganded and the binary complexes of the double truncated form DN1 ­102/DC428 ­ 452-hPheOH with oxidized (BH2) and reduced (BH4) cofactor have revealed some important conformational changes of the active-site structure upon cofactor binding. Thus, in the hPheOH ­ Fe(III)·BH2 complex,8 the loop between residues 245 and 250 shows the largest displacement (the Ca atom of Gly247 moves ° , 1.3 A toward the pterin ring), in the direction of the iron atom, and thus is able to form several hydrogen bonds to the pterin ring. Furthermore, the Leu248 side-chain changes its conformation as compared to the non-liganded structure, and now faces the active site. Leu255 also shifts its conformation to accommodate the dihydropropyl sidechain of the pterin molecule. In the hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 structure,12 the overall fold is very similar to that reported for hPheOH ­ Fe(III)·BH2. However, superposition of the two structures has revealed that the reduced cofactor is displaced ° about 0.5 A away from Ser251, and that the pterin ring is rotated about 108 (along the C4a ­ C8a bond) with the pyrimidine ring rotated towards Phe254. The angle between the hydroxyl groups in the dihydroxypropyl group is 2 658, which enables the BH4 O20 to make a strong hydrogen bond ° (2.4 A) with the side-chain oxygen atom of Ser251, while O10 forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds between residues Ala322 and Glu330. In addition, Glu330 adopts a completely different conformation in the hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 structure. On the basis of these crystallographic data, it is evident that in both oxidation states of the enzyme and cofactor the pterin cofactor binds to the enzyme active site by an induced-fit mechanism involving a conformational change in the active-site crevice structure of the protein. In the present study, it is further demonstrated that the binding of the substrate analogue THA to the binary complex hPheOH ­ Fe(II)·BH4 triggers large additional conformational changes at the active-site crevice structure. The largest deviation occurs in the region comprising the residues 131 ­ 155 with a maximum main-chain r.m.s. displace° ment (9.6 A) at Tyr138. The hydroxyl oxygen atom ° of this residue is indeed displaced 18.5 A closer to the catalytic iron atom. Furthermore, Glu330 adopts a bidentate coordination and conformation not observed previously in any crystal structure of

° atom 3.0 A away from carbon atoms in both Trp326 and Glu330 (Figure 6(b)). Whereas L -Phe and, to a certain degree, L -mTyr, are well accommodated in the present active-site structure, and with specific interactions similar to that of THA, the hydroxyl group of L -Tyr is not accepted, due to steric hindrance. The resulting strained binding site for L -Tyr may well explain why this amino acid is not a substrate, but is an appropriate leaving product. Thus, the crystal structure is in complete agreement with the substrate specificity observed in steady-state kinetics.16 Site-directed mutagenesis has been performed on TyrOH to identify residues responsible for substrate binding.27 Arg316 (Arg270 in PheOH) was shown to be critical for substrate binding with a 400-fold higher Km value for the Arg316Lys mutation, whereas the Asp328Ser (Asp282 in

PheOH. Thus, the binding of both the pterin cofactor and the substrate induces conformational changes at the active site that have not been detected by any alternative biophysical method. Functional implications The PheOH-catalyzed hydroxylation of L -Phe is a three-substrate reaction with specific binding sites for L -Phe, BH4 and dioxygen, and there is general agreement that the Fe(II) centre participates directly in oxygen incorporation.21,28,29 In the present structure of the unproductive (anaerobic) ternary complex, the binding sites for L -Phe and BH4 and the iron coordination are clearly defined. The structure has revealed a five-coordinated iron atom with a distorted square-pyramidal coordination, as proposed previously on the basis of MCD spectral analysis of rPheOH.25 This finding is consistent with the ordered reaction mechanism proposed for the enzyme, wherein cofactor and substrate must be present before any product is released.28,30 The position of dioxygen binding to the iron is not established unequivocally, and attempts to bind NO and CO (by diffusion into crystals of the ternary complex) have not been successful so far. Dioxygen may bind either into the position occupied by Wat2 (as shown in Figure 7(b)) or into the open coordination position, as favoured in a recent model.30 In the catalytic reaction, dioxygen is cleaved, incorporating one of the oxygen atoms into BH4 to form 4a-hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin (4a-OH-BH4),31,32 while the other oxygen atom is incorporated into the substrate to generate L -Tyr. L -Phe/L -Tyr were modeled manually into the THA-binding site by conserving the main-chain and the x1 and x2 angles (Figure 7(a)) and 4a-OH-BH4 (calculated using the perturbative Becke ­ Perdew model (pBP/DNp p )33,34 of the PC SPARTAN PRO programme package) was superimposed on BH4 (Figure 7(a)) to simulate the positions of the oxygen atoms of dioxygen after the reaction but prior to product and cofactor release. On the basis of their relative positions, dioxygen was modeled manually into the active site, positioning one of the atoms (proximal oxygen) at Wat2 and the other atom (distal oxygen) in the direction of the hydroxyl oxygen atom in 4a-OH-BH4 (Figure 7(b)). The proximal oxygen ° ° atom is then 3.3 A from L -Tyr Oh and 3.0 A from the closest carbon atom in THA/L -Phe, while the ° distal oxygen atom is 0.9 A from the 4a-OH-BH4 ° hydroxyl oxygen atom and 2.2 A from BH4 C4a. However, modeling dioxygen in the same manner in the open coordination position (at the position of Wat3 in the binary hPheOH ­Fe(II)·BH4 ° complex)12 leaves the proximal oxygen atom 5.6 A h ° from the closest carbon from L -Tyr O and 5.1 A atom in THA/L -Phe, while the distal oxygen atom ° is 1.8 A from the 4a-OH-BH4 hydroxyl oxygen ° atom and 1.9 A from BH4 C4a. Binding of dioxygen at the open coordination position seems unlikely, ° since BH4 O4 is close (, 1.0 A). However, the

proposed dioxygen-binding site at the Wat2 position is in a hydrophobic microenvironment consisting of His285, BH4, THA/L -Phe and Pro281 ° with the side-chain of Pro281 3.4 A from the distal oxygen atom. It is important to note here that the P281L mutation is associated with severe PKU.35,47 A displacement of the BH4 molecule upon substrate binding has been proposed to accommodate a possible Fe(II)-peroxo-BH4 intermediate,12,36 and is indeed confirmed in the present structure (Figure 5). The crystallographic data are entirely consistent with the occurrence of a large-scale conformational transition that brings the two substrates into the close proximity required for reaction. Thus, the pterin C4a ­Fe(II) distance of ° 4.5 A in the ternary complex is far more appropriate for the formation of a bridging dioxygen molecule between the iron atom and BH4 (as a putative Fe(II) ­O ­ O ­ BH4 intermediate) than the ° C4a ­ Fe(II) distance of 5.9 A in the binary BH4 structure, implying that the bridging dioxygen intermediate can be formed only after substrate binding. On this basis, the following ordered reaction mechanism can be proposed (Figure 8), wherein cofactor and substrate are bound before any product is released. Although little is known about the mechanism of reduction,28 prereduction of the active-site iron (step 1) is an obligate event prior to catalysis.37 Significant changes occur in the active site upon reduction, including a reduced affinity for two of the coordinated water molecules (Wat1 and Wat2), a displacement of Glu330 and possible disorder of its side-chain.12 The reversible binding of BH4 (step 2) changes the overall coordination geometry and causes the Glu330 ligand to change its coordination to the iron atom.12 The reversible binding of L -Phe (step 3) triggers a further conformational change altering the iron coordination to a highly distorted square pyramidal geometry where Glu330 adopts yet another conformation with bidentate iron coordination (Figure 2). Furthermore, the position of BH4 in the active site is altered (Figure 5), favouring dioxygen binding at the position occupied by Wat2 (Figure 7(b)) and the formation of a putative Fe(II)­ O ­O ­ BH4 (4a-peroxy-BH4) intermediate25,38 (step 4). Although the molecular mechanism of dioxygen activation is still an unsolved question, a heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen­ oxygen bond30,38,39 produces a molecule of 4a-OH-BH4 and an oxidizing species, the so-called activated oxygen intermediate (most likely an oxyferryl species) (step 5), leading finally to release of the products (step 6). Experimental evidence has been presented that the formation of the hydroxylating intermediate is the rate-limiting step in the tyrosine hydroxylasecatalyzed reaction.39,40,63 In the non-heme iron enzyme extradiol dioxygenase, a tyrosine residue at the active site has been proposed to stabilize a radical intermediate in the catalytic cycle.41,42 In hPheOH, Tyr325 has been considered to have a similar function,6 but site-directed mutagenesis revealed that it plays no

direct role in the catalytic reaction.8 It remains to be seen if the substrate-induced reorientation of Tyr138 gives this residue a similar function. Alternatively, Tyr138 may contribute to determine the substrate specificity, since this is a phenylalanine residue (Phe214) in TyrOH. It is interesting to note that a tyrosine residue is present at the equivalent position of tryptophan hydroxylase. Another possibility is that Tyr138 plays an important role in the regulation of the enzyme. The relation between the substrate-induced conformational change in the catalytic domain and that observed in the full-length tetrameric wild-type enzyme Although there is general agreement about the importance of L -Phe (and some substrate analogues) for the activation of the tetrameric fulllength wild-type enzyme,4,18 determination of the mechanism by which the substrate induces the related global conformational change has remained elusive.4,18 In the present study, it has been shown that binding of the substrate at the active site triggers large-scale structural changes in the catalytic

domain, including the active-site crevice structure, which are likely to represent the epicenter of the global conformational change observed in the full-length tetrameric enzyme, and thus delineate a molecular mechanism for substrate-activation of the tetramer. The conformational changes allow the cofactor and substrate to access the active site during enzyme turnover more freely.10,43 It is notable that, so far, hPheOH has not been crystallized in the full-length form, and that further studies on this enzyme form are required to demonstrate how the conformational change in the catalytic domain may be transmitted to other parts of the enzyme.

Figure 8. Reaction pathway of PheOH. The catalytic cycle consists of a reduction of the iron centre [1] which converts the six-coordinate, high-spin Fe(III) to a "four-coordinate", high-spin Fe(II); reversible binding of BH4, which results in a six-coordinate Fe(II) and a change in coordination of Glu330 [2]; reversible binding of L -Phe to give a highly distorted square pyramidal five-coordinated Fe(II), with a bidentate coordination of Glu330 [3]; reversible binding of dioxygen to give a five-coordinated Fe(II)-O2 intermediate followed by the formation of the putative Fe(II) ­ O­ O­ BH4 intermediate [4]; heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen ­ oxygen bond and the formation of a 4a-OH-BH4 and an oxyferryl species [5], and products are finally released [6].

resulting metabolic and clinical phenotypes range in severity from mild forms of non-PKU HPA to the severe forms of PKU. The structural basis of some of the metabolic and enzymatic phenotypes has been discussed recently11 in the light of the four crystal structures of inactive Fe(III) forms of the enzyme, but without information on the mode of substrate binding and associated conformational changes in the catalytic domain. Table 2 presents a summary of the current information on the reported missense single-point mutations of active-site residues, involved in the binding of the reduced pterin cofactor and the substrate. Of these mutations, 13 are found in nine residues involved in cofactor binding, and 14 mutations in are found in eight residues involved in substrate binding. Only a few of these mutations have been expressed as recombinant enzymes.5,44 ­ 49 As expected, mutations of residues at the pterin cofactor and substrate-binding sites result in reduced affinities for BH4 and L -Phe, respectively, and thus reduced catalytic efficiency in steady-state kinetic analyses.

In addition, some of these mutations affect the overall structure and stability of the enzyme.5,45

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and data collection Expression and purification of the double truncated mutant (DN1 ­ 102/DC428­ 452) of hPheOH were carried out as described.50,51 Anaerobic co-crystallization of hPheOH ­ Fe(II) in complex with BH4 was undertaken essentially as described12 but with some modifications. The drops contained initial concentrations of BH4 of 5 mM, and 15 mM sodium dithionite was used as the reducing agent. After four days of growth, solid THA was added in excess to the drop (anaerobic) and left for 24 hours to allow diffusion. A crystal of approximate size 0.6 mm £ 0.2 mm £ 0.05 mm was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and data were collected at 100 K on the Swiss ­ Norwegian Beamline (BM01) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble ° (France). A wavelength of 0.800 A and a MAR345 Research imaging plate system were used. Processing of

the data was done using DENZO,52 while scaling and merging were carried out using SCALA in the CCP4 program suite.53 Model building and refinement The refinement was initiated by a rigid-body refinement of the catalytic domain of hPheOH ­ Fe(III)6 (PDB entry 1PAH) using CNS version 1.0:54 10% of the reflections were excluded in the refinement for crossvalidation.55 The initial R-factor was 50.7%, suggesting large deviations from the starting model, but three rounds of simulated annealing (CNS) dropped the R-factor to 33.6%. At this point, 88 residues (132 ­ 149, 333­ 342 and 351­ 410) were outside electron density and subsequently removed from the model. The omitted residues were gradually re-added, in between rounds of energy minimization and refinement, in their correct positions at the ends of the remaining four peptide chains. The model building was done using the graphical programme O56 and sA-weighted20 2Fo 2 Fc and Fo 2 Fc maps calculated in CNS. The electron densities for both BH4 and THA were good even after one round of simulated annealing, but they were added to the model after all three rounds of simulated annealing. Water oxygen atoms were added throughout the proceeding refinement as clear 2Fo 2 Fc and Fo 2 Fc densities appeared in positions compatible with hydrogen bonds to the protein or other water molecules. Luzatti64 and sA coordinate errors and r.m.s. deviations concerning bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles and improper angles were calculated using CNS. Statistics of the processing and of the final model is presented in Table 3. ° A crystal structure to 2.1 A of the binary hPheOH ­ Fe(III)·BH2 complex was obtained (data not shown) by using known crystallization conditions,8 modified with a high concentration (5 mM) of BH2. This structure (PDB entry 1LRM) was refined by CNS to a final Rwork and Rfree of 21.1% and 23.8%, respectively.
