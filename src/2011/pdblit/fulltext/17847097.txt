ABSTRACT We have determined the crystal structure of DR1281 from Deinococcus radiodurans. DR1281 is a protein of unknown function with over 170 homologs found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To elucidate the molecular function of DR1281, ° its crystal structure at 2.3 A resolution was determined and a series of biochemical screens for catalytic activity was performed. The crystal structure shows that DR1281 has two domains, a small a domain and a putative catalytic domain formed by a four-layered structure of two b-sheets flanked by five a-helices on both sides. The small a domain interacts with other molecules in the asymmetric unit and contributes to the formation of oligomers. The structural comparison of the putative catalytic domain with known structures suggested its biochemical function to be a phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, nuclease, or nucleotidase. Structural analyses with its homologues also indicated that there is a dinuclear center at the interface of two domains formed by Asp8, Glu37, Asn38, Asn65, His148, His173, and His175. An absolute requirement of metal ions for activity has been proved by enzymatic assay with various divalent metal ions. A panel of general enzymatic assays of DR1281 revealed metal-dependent catalytic activity toward model substrates for phosphatases (p-nitrophenyl phosphate) and phosphodiesterases (bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Subsequent secondary enzymatic screens with natural substrates demonstrated significant phosphatase activity toward phosphoenolpyruvate and phosphodiesterase activity toward 20 ,30 -cAMP. Thus, our structural and enzymatic studies have identified the biochemical function of DR1281 as a novel phosphatase/phosphodiesterase and disclosed key conserved residues involved in metal binding and catalytic activity.

INTRODUCTION Deinococcus radiodurans, the world's toughest microbe, demonstrates an extreme resistance to genotoxic chemicals, oxidative damage, high levels of ionizing and ultraviolet radiation, and dehydratation. The capability to survive in such extreme environments is attributed in parts to a unique DNA repair system in combination with its chromosome structure and its ability for a fast recovery. Surprisingly, the analysis of the sequenced D. radiodurans genome revealed that the majority of its annotated proteins look like homologous proteins from Escherichia coli.1,2 The biggest surprise is that D. radiodurans encodes fewer genes known to be involved in DNA repair than E. coli.3 The sequence of the D. radiodurans genome also revealed that more than half of the predicted genes encode proteins with unknown function (hypothetical proteins), and over half of these (1002 genes) have no database match to genes from any other sequenced genome to date.1 Recent transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the majority of irradiation-induced genes of this organism are functionally uncharacterized or have only general functional predictions.4 Therefore, it is likely that the extraordinary resistance of D. radiodurans is associated with its hypothetical proteins. Comparative genomic analysis of the D. radiodurans genome also revealed expansions of 19 enzyme families including several different families of hydrolases (such as the Nudix family of pyrophosphosphatases, calcineurinGrant sponsor: Genome Canada through the Ontario Genomics Institute; Grant sponsor: National Core Research Center program of MOST and KOSEF through the CCS and DDR at Ewha Womans University; Grant number: R15-2006-020; Grant sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Grant number: GM 62412. *Correspondence to: Dong Hae Shin, College of Pharmacy, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 120-750, Republic of Korea.

like phosphoesterases, a/b hydrolases, subtilisin-like proteases, sugar deacetylases).2,5 Sometimes there is a clear connection between the extension of the particular protein family and the adaptation of this organism to its environment. In D. radiodurans, it appears that some of these hydrolases are likely to be involved in the decomposition of damage products (``cell cleaning'') under stress conditions.2 However, most of these enzymes are uncharacterized proteins. An open reading frame of D. radiodurans codes for a conserved hypothetical protein, DR1281, of 27.9 kDa molecular mass. A PSI-BLAST search of this sequence revealed around 170 proteins with full-length sequence identity ranging from $30 to $70% and an E-value below 0.005 (Fig. 1). Some of the homologous sequences are annotated as Ser/Thr protein phosphatase or metallophosphoesterase. In the Pfam databases,5 DR1281 matches calcineurin-like phosphoesterase (Pfam00149). This family includes a diverse range of phosphoesterases, including protein phosphoserine phosphatases, nucleotidases, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases, and 20 ,30 -cAMP phosphodiesterases as well as nucleases such as bacterial SbcD or yeast MRE11. This family also shows remote homology to the C-terminus of a lariat debranching enzyme. The most conserved regions in this superfamily are centered on the metal chelating residues. Structural genomics efforts enable structural studies to suggest the Enzyme Commission class to which a particular protein belongs.6,7 Combined with the structural genomics approach, application of general enzymatic screens and substrate profiling can greatly speed up the identification of biochemical function of unknown proteins.8 We applied this approach to elucidate structural and functional characteristics of DR1281.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning of DR1281

Primers (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA) for PCR amplification from genomic DNA contained an NdeI restriction site in the forward primer (50 -CATATGCGAGTCCTCTTCATCGG) and BamHI site in the reverse primer (50 GGATCCTTAGTCCTCGATAAAACGGTAGCG). PCR was performed using Deep Vent Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and D. radiodurans genomic DNA (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The PCR product was cloned into PCRBluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and the gene insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amplified TOPO vector was restricted with NdeI and BamHI and the gene insert was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis extraction. This insert was ligated into the pHM6g vector, a construct consisting of an N-terminal His-tag Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) fusion designed to be cleavable via a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease site. After transformation into DH5a, a plasmid containing the gene insert was isolated, confirmed, and then transformed into BL21(DE3) pSJS1240 for protein expression.9
Protein purification and crystallization

A selenomethionine derivative of the protein was expressed in a methionine auxotroph, E. coli strain B834(DE3)/pSJS1240,10 and grown in M9 medium supplied with selenomethionine. Cells were disrupted by microfluidization (Microfluidics, Newton, MA) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 lg/mL DNAse I, 0.1 lg/mL antipain, 1 lg/mL chymostatin, 0.5 lg/mL leupeptin, and 0.7 lg/ mL pepstatin A.

The His6MBP-fusion protein was affinity purified using two 5 mL HiTrap Chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The fusion protein was bound to the column in 10% glycerol, 5 mM imidazole, 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and was eluted with a gradient of 10­ 300 mM imidazole in 10 column volumes. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at room temperature against 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA in the presence of TEV protease. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a 5 mL HiTrap-Q column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The protein was eluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 220 mM NaCl. The SDS-PAGE showed one band around 28 kDa corresponding to the molecular weight of DR1281. The protein was concentrated to 4.0 mg/mL for crystallization. Dynamic light scattering (DynaPro 99, Wyatt Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA) showed a polydisperse peak indicating the presence of a monomeric and an oligomeric form of DR1281. The initial crystallization conditions were screened by the sparse matrix method11 using the Hampton Research kits (Aliso Viejo, California) and by in-house developed screening methods (unpublished) at 228C. In the optimized crystallization conditions, 1 lL of the concentrated protein solution above was mixed with 1 lL of CAPS pH 10.5, 0.2M lithium sulfate, 0.1% n-hexyl b-D-glucose, and 30% PEG4000. The hanging drop was equilibrated with 0.5 mL of 30% PEG4000, 0.2M lithium sulfate. Long rod shaped crystals grew in 1 day to approximate dimensions of 0.1 mm 3 0.05 mm 3 0.05 mm.
Data collection and reduction

A single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method was used to find heavy atom positions. Fifty two out of 56 selenium positions were located using the program SnB.13 The program SHARP14 was used for phase re° finement to 2.3 A followed by solvent flattening with 15 The map calculated by using the imSOLOMON. proved phases was not good enough to trace the backbone structure of the protein. However, the presence of improper eightfold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) was identified during an initial backbone tracing. Eightfold NCS density averaging was carried out using the DM program in the CCP4 package.16 Partial models for eight monomers were built using the O program.17 On the basis of the partial models, the eight NCS matrices were refined using a software in the RAVE program package18 of real-space averaging and density-manipulation programs. The preliminary model was then refined using the program CNS.19 The reflections in this data set ° between 20.0 and 2.3 A were included throughout the refinement calculations. Ten percent of the data were randomly chosen for free R-factor cross validation. The refinement statistics are shown in Table II. Isotropic

Structural and Enzymatic Characterization of DR1281

B-factors for individual atoms were initially fixed to 20 ° A2 and were refined in the last stages. The 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc maps were used for manual rebuilding between refinement cycles and for the location of solvent molecules. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the access code of 1T70.

Enzymatic screening and assays

General enzymatic screens for phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, esterase, protease, dehydrogenase, and oxidase activities were performed as previously described8 using the native protein. Screening for phosphatase activity against natural substrates was done using 70 phosphorylated compounds as described.8 Phosphatase activity towards phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) was assayed in 160 lL reaction mixtures containing 50 mM MES-K buffer (pH 6.25), 0­1.25 mM MnCl2 (as indicated), 0­2.0 mM PEP (as indicated), and 1.0­1.5 lg DR1281. After 15­20 min incubation at 378C, the reaction was terminated by addition of Malachite Green reagent20 and the production of Pi was measured at 630 nm. Phosphodiesterase activity with 20 ,30 -cyclic nucleoside monophosphates was measured using a quantitative assay based on measurement of the alkaline phosphatase-sensitive nucleotide product as previously described.21 The activity was assayed in 80 lL reaction mixtures containing 50 mM MES-K buffer (pH 6.25), 0­4.0 mM divalent metal (as indicated), 0­4.5 mM substrate, and 0.7­1.0 lg DR1281. After a 15­20 min incubation at 378C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 lL of 23 alkaline phosphatase buffer (0.2M diethanolamine buffer, pH 10.0, and 10 mM MgCl2) and incubated with 0.25 units of alkaline phosphatase for 10 min at 378C. This reaction was terminated by the addition of Malachite Green reagent,8 and the production of Pi was measured at 630 nm. For metal saturations (Mn21, Fe21, Co21), the reaction mixture contained 0.5­1.0 mM 20 ,30 -cAMP and 0­ 4.0 mM metal. For the determination of the Km and Vmax, nonlinear curve fitting from the Lineweaver­Burk plot using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used.

and a putative catalytic domain, a four-layered structure formed by two b-sheets flanked by five a-helices on both sides. The small a domain has relatively low sequence homology among family members (Fig. 1). In the crystal, this domain interacts with other protein molecules and is involved in protein oligomerization [Fig. 3(A)]. In the asymmetric unit, two dimers form a tetramer [Fig. 3(B)]. The surface area of DR1281 buried by dimer formation ° is $980 A2 per monomer, which is within the range of known dimeric molecules.24 The surface area between dimers that results in a tetrameric state in the crystal

° structure is $1950 A2 per dimer. Almost all the interactions involved in oligomer formation are single or few contacts through the side chains. Therefore, there are no elongated hydrophobic or ionic network interactions at the dimeric or tetrameric interfaces. Thus, the oligomeric states may be achieved or destroyed easily depending on surrounding conditions influencing these weak interactions such as pH, salt, or protein concentration.

supported by results from dynamic light scattering experiments indicating the presence of several oligomeric states of DR1281 in solution (data not shown). In the structure, no metal was found because of the usage of EDTA during the protein purification.
Structural comparison of DR1281 with its structural homologs

A DALI search25 shows that the highest similarity is found with the N-terminal domain of 50 -nucleotidase (50 -NT) from E. coli26 with Z value of 17.4 [root-mean° square (r.m.s) deviations of 2.8 A for 213 pairs of aligned Ca atoms; 16% sequence identity, 1ush-A]. Most of the N-terminal domain of 50 -NT from E. coli is matched with the putative catalytic domain of DR1281 [Fig. 3(C)], despite low sequence similarity. The homologue structures with Z value larger than 6 have sequence signature motifs indicating that these enzymes belong to a large superfamily of distantly related metallophosphoesterases, including purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) and Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PP-1 and PP-2B). In general, metallophosphoesterases have a canonical dinuclear center at the active site. On the basis of the structural comparison, the dinuclear center of DR1281 is also found at a cluster of canonical turn/loop regions [Fig. 3(B)]. Though these regions are quite similar to each other at the structural level, they are not well conserved at the sequence level. The first metal binding site of DR1281 is composed of Asp8, Glu37, Asn38, and H175 [Fig. 4(A)]. The electric charge is similar to that of mammalian PAP [Fig. 4(B)]. However, E. coli 50 -NT and MJ0938 have a different number of charged residues in this site [Fig. 4(B)]. The second metal binding site of DR1281 is relatively well conserved in terms of two histidines (H148 and H173) and one aspartate (N65) as shown in E. coli 50 -NT, MJ0938, and mammalian PAP. Interestingly, DR1281 is unique in that a bi-dentate glutamate (Glu37) is used instead of aspartate or tyrosine [Fig. 4(B)]. Although the metal binding sites are structurally similar, differences in their primary sequence confer subtle difference in specific activity while having common phosphatase activity. In general, catalytic residues are next to the metal binding sites. In the E. coli 50 -NT, a catalytic Asp-His dyad (Asp120 and His117) performs hydrolysis. They are His202, His295, His296 in kidney bean PAP.27 In P. furiosus Mre11, two histidines (His52 and His85) are involved in charge relay reaction.28 Similarly, there are two histidines (His66 and His69) around the dinuclear center of DR1281. However, a complex structure should be obtained to clarify the catalytic residues.

° 7 A wide as it narrows toward the di-zinc center [Fig. 3(B)]. However, the active-site region of DR1281 has a negative electrostatic potential in contrast to the positive electrostatic potential of E. coli 50 -NT,26 a difference that may be important for specific substrate binding and catalysis. In E. coli 50 -NT, the two aromatic residues (F429 and F498) from the C-terminal domain serve as hydrophobic patches to coordinate the base of ATP.29 Interestingly, two highly conserved phenylalanine residues, F215 and F223, from the small a domain of DR1281 are positioned similarly to the two phenylalanines of E. coli 50 -NT.

Enzymatic studies of DR1281

In general enzymatic screens (see Materials and Methods), purified DR1281 demonstrated high catalytic activity toward model substrates for phosphatases (pnitrophenyl phosphate, pNPP) and phosphodiesterases (bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Both activities were Mn21-dependent and had a slightly alkaline pH optimum (pH 8.5). DR1281 also hydrolyzed two other known model phosphodiesterase substrates, p-nitrophenyl thymidine monophosphate (pNP-TMP) and p-nitrophenyl phosphorylcholine (pNPPC). The protein demonstrated classical Michaelis kinetics with pNPP, bis-pNPP, and pNP-TMP, but showed no saturation with pNPPC up to 2 mM concentration indicating the substrate binding was a limiting step in this reaction (data not shown). Analysis of the calculated kinetic parameters for the model substrates (Table III) revealed that bis-pNPP supported the highest catalytic (phosphodiesterase) activity, whereas the substrate affinity was higher with pNPP or pNP-TMP (lower Km). Secondary enzymatic screens with natural phosphatase substrates identified significant metal-dependent phosphatase activity toward PEP and several nucleoside triphosphates, while screens with phosphodiesterase substrates detected activity toward 20 ,30 -cyclic nucleotides [Fig. 5(A)]. Both phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities of DR1281 had similar pH optimum (pH 6.0­ 7.0), but showed different metal preferences [Fig. 5(B)]. Mn21 was a preferable metal for phosphatase activity of this protein (PEP hydrolysis), whereas similar phosphodiesterase activities (with 20 ,30 -cAMP) were observed in the presence of Co21, Mn21, or Fe21. With natural substrates, DR1281 showed the highest affinity to Mn21 (K Mn 5 0.18 mM; PEP hydrolysis) and to Co21 (K Co 5 d d Fe 0.21 mM, K d 5 0.36 mM, K Mn 5 0.91 mM; 20 ,30 -cAMP d hydrolysis). TLC analysis of the reaction products produced during the hydrolysis of 20 ,30 -cAMP by DR1281 identified 30 -AMP as the only product [Fig. 5(C)]. Therefore, DR1281 is a 20 ,30 -cyclic nucleotide 30 -phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.37). Saturation experiments with natural substrates demonstrated hyperbolic kinetics with the highest affinity to PEP (Km 5 0.36 mM) and 20 ,30 -cAMP

(Km 5 0.55 mM) (Table III). Although DR1281 showed rather low reaction velocities with natural substrates, its substrate affinities were within the range of substrate affinities of known 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphodiesterases (0.25­ 13.1 mM; BRENDA database; http://www.brenda.unikoeln.de). Thus, our enzymatic studies identified a biochemical function of DR1231 as a dual activity phosphatase/phosphodiesterase with PEP and 20 ,30 -cAMP as preferable in vitro substrates. The determination of the physiological function of DR1281 requires additional studies using complementary approaches (bioinformatics, gene knockout, gene expression). However, our results suggest that this protein might be involved in the recycling of nucleotides produced during RNA degradation by various nucleases. The total RNA content of an average microbial cell is quite high (20.5%) and is continuously replenishing.30 RNA hydrolysis by different nucleases have been shown to produce 20 ,30 -cyclic nucleotides,31­35 which might be further degraded by DR1281. Since the recent microarray study revealed no significant changes in the expression of DR1281 in cells recovering from the radiation stress,3 this protein might be involved in nucleotide recycling during normal metabolism or after other stress conditions (like oxidizing agents, UV light, desiccation).
Comparison of DR1281 with enzymes with a dual activity of phosphatase/ phosphodiesterase

There are several enzymes having a similar molecular function to that of DR1281: (1) The dual activity of phosphatase/phosphodiesterase has been known for phospholipase D from Streptomyces chromofuscus.36 The phospholipase D from S. chromofuscus is a soluble enzyme that interacts with membranes to catalyse phosphatidylcholine transformation. (2) The well known 2H phosphoesterase superfamily37 shows 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphodiesterase activity and has two copies of HX[TS]h motif (2H motif, h a hydrophobic residue).

ase, and phosphatase activities.22 The data suggest that the phosphohydrolase activities of the HD domain of the E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase are involved in the repair of the 30 -CCA end of tRNA. (4) The cpdB gene of Yersinia enterocolitica O:8 produces a phosphatase/phosphodiesterase with 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphodiesterase activity.38 This enzyme enables Y. enterocolitica to grow on 20 ,30 -cAMP as a sole source of carbon and energy. However, none of these enzymes show sequence homology to DR1281. Therefore, DR1281 is a novel phosphatase/phosphodiesterase with a preference to PEP and 20 ,30 -cAMP, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have applied two approaches, structural genomics and general enzymatic screens, to characterize the biochemical function of DR1281. The crystal structure of this protein revealed the phosphohydrolaselike fold with a dinuclear metal center at the putative active site, whereas enzymatic studies demonstrated the presence of both phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities with a preference to PEP and 20 ,30 -cAMP, respectively. Subsequent biochemical assays helped to elucidate an enzymatic function for the protein. Analyses of the structure and the molecular function reveal common as well as unique properties of DR1281 as a representative of $170 family members.
