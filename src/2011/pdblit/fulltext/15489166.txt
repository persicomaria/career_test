ABSTRACT: Copolymer 1 [Cop 1, poly (Y, E, A, K)] is a random synthetic amino acid copolymer effective in the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that is linked to HLA-DR2 (DRB1*1501). Another copolymer [poly (Y, A, K)] was also identified that binds to rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated HLA-DR1 (DRB1*0101) or HLA-DR4 (DRB1*0401) molecules and inhibits the response of HLA-DR1- and -DR4-restricted T cell clones to an immunodominant epitope of collagen type II (CII) 261­273 (a candidate autoantigen in RA). In the present study various peptides have been synthesized based on binding "motifs" of Cop 1 for HLADR1 and -DR4 molecules. Those peptides with K at P-1 or K at P8 were particularly effective as inhibitors of binding of CII 261­273, of Cop 1 and of the influenza virus hemagglutinin peptide 306 ­318 to these class II proteins. Moreover, several of them were also potent inhibitors of the CII 261­273-reactive T cell clones. These findings suggest that small peptides or their more stable derivatives may be able to substitute for copolymers in the treatment of RA, and by implication of MS.

multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis

INTRODUCTION Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common human autoimmune disease with a prevalence of about 1% among Caucasians [1, 2]. It is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the synovial joints and infiltration by activated T cells, macrophages, and plasma cells [3, 4], leading to

a progressive destruction of the articular cartilage. Inherited susceptibility to RA is strongly associated with the DRB1 loci encoding HLA-DR1 (DRB1*0101) and -DR4 (DRB1*0401, DRB1*0404, or DRB1*0405) molecules [5­9]. Residues 67­71 are polymorphic in HLA-DR proteins but these RA-related allotypes share a DR polymorphism in this region that contributes to the P4 pocket of the peptide binding groove [10, 11] as well as residues that interact with the T-cell receptor of CD4 T lymphocytes [12­14]. RA-associated HLA-DR molecules may confer disease susceptibility by presenting distinct sets of antigenic peptides derived from a synovial joint protein(s) to CD4 T lymphocytes [15, 16]. Although the nature of the autoantigen(s) in RA is unknown, CII has been proposed as a candidate because it

is a major protein of hyaline cartilage, and is able to induce arthritis resembling RA in genetically susceptible animals [17­24]. Animal models for collagen-induced arthritis, including mice transgenic for HLA-DR1 or -DR4 [22, 24, 25], enabled mapping of T-cell determinants implicated in the autoimmune response to CII [26 ­28]. An HLA-DR1 and -DR4 immunodominant T-cell epitope in CII corresponding to residues 261­273 has been identified [24, 25, 27]. Selective presentation of autoantigenic peptides could be a major mechanism underlying the genetic association between certain DRB1 alleles and autoimmune diseases [8]. Inhibition of antigen presentation by disease-associated HLA-DR molecules could interfere with the autoimmune process, based on the peptide binding mode which requires specific types of side chains at anchor positions, but permits a large variety of side chains at non-anchor positions to be presented to T cells [29 ­36]. This principle of blocking antigen presentation has been shown to be effective in animal models of autoimmune diseases [37, 38]. Copolymer 1 [Cop 1, poly (Y, E, A, K)] is a synthetic amino acid copolymer effective both in suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [39 ­ 43] and in the treatment of relapsing forms of MS [44 ­ 46]. Cop 1 binds to purified human HLA-DR molecules within the peptide binding groove [47], and inhibits the binding of HA 306 ­318 peptide, a high affinity epitope of influenza virus, to both HLA-DR1 (DRB1*0101) and -DR4 (DRB1*0401) molecules [47]. Copolymers composed of only three amino acids [poly (E, A, K), poly (Y, E, A), poly (Y, A, K), and poly (Y, E, K)] also bound to purified HLA-DR1, -DR2, and -DR4 molecules [48]. Moreover, these three amino acid copolymers, particularly poly (Y, A, K), competed with CII 261­273 for binding to RAassociated HLA-DR1 (DRB1*0101) and -DR4 (DRB1*0401) molecules, and also inhibited CII-reactive T cell clones [49]. The binding motifs of Cop 1 for these class II MHC proteins have recently been determined [50] (see the Discussion section). In the present study various peptides were synthesized according to these motifs of Cop 1 in an attempt to design peptides that may substitute for copolymers in binding to and blocking HLA-DR1 and -DR4. To examine the role of the residues at P 1 and P 2 as found in the bound Cop 1 [50] in the stabilization of peptide complexes with the HLA-DR molecules and the TCR, peptides with different combinations of E, K and A at these positions as well as Y at P1 have been designed. Several synthetic epitopes, in particular those with K at P 1 and K at P8 of the bound peptide, competed efficiently with CII 261­273 for binding to HLA-DR1 (DRB1*0101) and -DR4 (DRB1*0401), and also inhibited CII-specific T cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Purification Soluble HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells as described [14, 51, 52]. Cells were grown in roller bottles in ExCell 401 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS, USA) supplemented with 0%­5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 26°C. Cells were harvested 4 ­5 days after induction by 1 mM CuSO4. Immunoaffinity purification of HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules was performed as previously reported [14]. Briefly, supernatant from harvested cells was sequentially passed through Protein A, Protein G, and Protein A-LB3.1 columns, followed by elution of the bound HLA-DR with 50 mM 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPS) (pH 11.5) and neutralized with 200 mM phosphate (pH 6.0). Proteins were concentrated on a Centriprep 10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA, USA). Antigens and Antibodies Cop 1 is a synthetic random copolymer prepared by polymerization of the N-carboxyanhydrides of L-tyrosine, -benzyl-L-glutamate, L-alanine and ,N-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine [39] (the end product is a mixture of acetate salts of random polypeptides). Cop 1, batch 52596, in the molar ratio of 1 Y: 1.5 E: 4.3 A: 3.3 K, with an average molecular weight (MW) of 8,150, was obtained from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Petach Tikva, Israel). Peptides Peptides were synthesized using solid phase techniques [53] on an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer (Foster City, CA, USA) and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Peptide sequences were HA 306 ­318, PKYVKQNTLKLAT, MW 1502, and CII 261­273, AGFKGEQGPKGEP, MW 1300. Peptides were synthesized on a 1 mole scale using the Multipin Peptide Synthesis System (Chiron Mimotopes) as 15-mers in two sets: (1) with free amine at N-terminus and free acid at C-terminus, and (2) with biotin linked to the N-terminus by the spacer SGSG and free acid at C-terminus. Peptide synthesis was monitored by including two standard peptide sequences as controls, which were subjected to HPLC and mass spectroscopy analysis. HA 306 ­318 peptide was also included as positive control for binding experiments. Pin peptides were lyophilized and resuspended at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). These conditions allowed the majority of peptides to be completely solubilized.

Peptide Labeling Biotinylation of Cop 1 was performed with excess Nhydroxysuccinimide biotin (Sigma) in DMSO as described [54]. Unreacted biotin was removed by dialysis (Spectra/Por membrane MWCO 500; Spectrum Medical Industries, Laguna Hills, CA, USA). Biotinylated HA 306 ­318 and CII 261­273 were purchased from Chiron Technologies (Clayton, Australia). Assays for Peptide Binding to Class II MHC Proteins Solutions. The solutions used in this assay are the following: binding buffer 20 mM 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% NaN3, pH 5.0, unless otherwise specified; PBS 150 mM sodium chloride, 7.5 mM sodium phosphate, dibasic, 2.5 mM sodium phosphate, monobasic, pH 7.2; TBS 137 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2.7 mM potassium chloride; TTBS TBS plus 0.05% Tween-20. Microtiter Assay Plate Preparation The 96-well microtiter immunoassay plates (PROBIND, Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) were coated with 1 g/well affinity-purified LB3.1 monoclonal antibodies in PBS (100 l total) for 18 h at 4°C. The wells were then blocked with TBS/3% BSA for 1 h at 37°C and washed three times with TTBS. Before sample addition, 50 l of TBS/1% BSA was added to each well. Inhibition reactions Biotinylated Cop 1, CII 261­273 or HA 306 ­318 (1.5 M each), all at a final concentration of 0.15 M in 50 l of the binding buffer, were coincubated with unlabeled inhibitors (Cop 1, CII 261­273 or multipin peptides), and DR molecules for 40 h at 37° C. Detection of Class II MHC Protein/Peptide Complexes Bound peptide-biotin was detected using streptavidinconjugated alkaline phosphatase, as follows. Plates were washed three times with TTBS and incubated with 100 l of streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (1: 3000; BioRad, Richmond, CA, USA) for 1 h at 7°C, followed by addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in triethanolamine buffer (BioRad). The absorbance at 410 nm was monitored by a microplate reader (model MR4000; Dynatech, Chantilly, VA, USA). T-Cell Hybridomas and Antigen Presentation Assays The following mouse T-cell hybridomas specific for CII were used: HLA-DR1-restricted 3.19 and 19.3 clones [24], and HLA-DR4-restricted 3838 and D3 clones [28]. APC were L57.23 (L cells transfected with HLA-DR1

[24]) and L cells transfected with HLA-DR4 [55]. T-cell stimulation experiments were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Irradiated (3000 rad) APC (2.5 104/well) were coincubated with CII 261­273 (40 g/ml) and peptides (125 g/ml) for 2 h at 37°C, then T cells (5 104/well) were added and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Supernatants (30 l) were taken and incubated with IL-2-dependent CTLL (5 104/well) for 12 h, followed by labeling with 3Hthymidine (1 Ci/well) for 12 h. Plates were harvested and the radioactivity was monitored using a 1450 microbeta Plus liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Gaithesburg, MD, USA). RESULTS Criteria for Design of the Synthetic Peptides A variety of peptide 15-mers were synthesized based on the motifs recently described for binding of Cop 1 to the groove of HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules [50]. The reference peptides for comparison were the high affinity binding epitope HA 306 ­318 [11, 32, 33, 56, 57], and a HA 306 ­318 peptide derivative that had previously been synthesized with Y at P1, K at P8 (to increase solubility) and A at all other residues and was shown to bind with similar affinity as HA 306 ­318 [58]. Various combinations of E, K and A were present at the Nterminus of the majority of the 33 peptides, followed by Y at the presumed P1 of the bound peptide (shown in bold in Table 1), as found in the motif for binding of Cop 1, with A in the subsequent binding pockets [50]. Three different groups of peptides were synthesized (Table 1). Peptides in group A had K at P8 as well as Y at P1 (in bold). Group B similarly also had Y at P1 but A at P8 (Table 1). In group C, Y was shifted one or two residues with reference to the HA 306 ­318 peptide (Table 1). All these groups also had one or more E and/or K residues, both to approximate the described binding motif and for solubility. Both N-terminal biotinylated and unlabeled sets of peptides were synthesized for these studies. Inhibition of Binding of Cop 1, HA 306 ­318, and CII 261­273 to HLA-DR Molecules by the Synthetic Peptides To examine whether the synthetic peptides competed with Cop 1, the high affinity HA 306 ­318 peptide or the immunodominant epitope CII 261­273 for binding to HLA-DR1 and -DR4, competitive binding assays were carried out with biotinylated materials (Cop 1, HA 306 ­318, or CII 261­273) and the unsubstituted inhibitors (Cop 1, HA, CII, and the synthetic peptides). HLA-DR1. Unsubstituted Cop 1 or HA 306 ­318 (peptide #4) inhibited binding of biotinylated Cop 1 to

FIGURE 1 Residue K at P-1 of the unlabeled Multipin peptides enhances the inhibition of biotinylated Cop 1 and HA 306 ­318 binding to HLADR1 and -DR4 molecules. Recombinant HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules were incubated with 1.5 M of biotinylated ligands Cop 1 (8,150) or HA 306 ­318 alone, or in the presence of unlabeled competitors at a range of concentrations. Peptides are paired so that closed symbols represent peptides with and open symbols those without K at P-1. All incubations were carried out in duplicate at pH 5.0 for 40 h at 37°C. For details see the Materials and Methods section. Results represent mean of two independent experiments. Specific binding is expressed as percentage of inhibition using the formula: percentage of inhibition 100% [(signal with competitor background)/signal without competitor background) 100]. The signals at 410 nm without competitor were 0.91­ 0.97 and the background was 0.13.

recombinant HLA-DR1 molecules better than any of the synthetic peptides in groups A­C (Table 1, Figure 1, left panels). Most striking was the complete dependence on K at P8 for competition with binding of HA 306-318 as well as a severe requirement for competition with Cop 1 (compare group A with groups B and C in Table 1 and see Figure 2, left panels). In addition, peptides in group A with K at P-1 were better inhibitors of the binding of both biotinylated Cop 1 and HA 306 ­318 to HLA-DR1 molecules than those without K at P-1 (Table 1, Figure 1, left panels). Only some peptides in group B showed this effect. Residue E alone at P-2 did not affect the affinity of the binding to HLA-DR1 (Table 1). However, both E at P-2 or at P-1 and K at P-1 increased the affinity of peptides to HLA-DR1 (peptides #6, 7, 12, 15, and 18 compared to # 5, 9, and 16, Table 1, Figure 1, left panels). HLA-DR4. The binding of biotinylated Cop 1 to HLADR4 molecules was efficiently inhibited by many of the peptides in groups 1­3, but the binding of biotinylated HA 306 ­318 to HLA-DR4 was better inhibited by Cop 1 than by HA 306 ­318 or other peptides (Table 1). The enhancement due to K at P8 was also evident in binding of group A peptides (as compared to group B) to HLA-

DR4 (Figure 2, right panels) but less pronounced than to HLA-DR1 (Figure 2, left panels). Similarly to the binding to HLA-DR1 molecules, K at P-1 increased significantly the affinity of peptide binding to HLA-DR4 particularly evident in peptides #15, 29, and 31, whereas E at P-2 or at P-1 did not seem to affect peptide binding (Table 1, Figure 1, right panels). To further characterize the potential of the synthetic peptides to compete with CII 261­273 as well as Cop 1 and HA 306 ­318 for binding to HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules, competitive binding assays were also carried out with biotinylated Multipin peptides and the three unlabeled inhibitors. The binding of the majority of the biotinylated peptides in groups A-C to both HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 molecules was inhibited by all three substances (data not shown). Inhibition of HLA-DR1- and -DR4-restricted CII-specific T-Cell Responses by the Synthetic Peptides To determine whether the synthetic peptides could also inhibit presentation of the CII 261­273 peptide to autoreactive T cells, CII-specific T-cell hybridomas restricted to HLA-DR1 (3.19 and 19.3) [24] and HLADR4 (3838 and D3) [28] were examined.

Peptides are again paired so that closed symbols represent peptides with and open symbols those without K at P8. Details are as in the legend for Figure 1.

HLA-DR1 or HLA-DR4 APC (see Materials and Methods) were incubated with CII 261­273 and relevant peptides for 2 h before T-cell hybridomas were added for 24 h; supernatants were then tested for IL-2 secretion by these hybridomas. Peptides #15, 26, 29, 32, and #15, 26, and 27 were the most potent inhibitors of HLADR1-restricted T-cell clones 3.19 and 19.3, respectively, using L fibroblasts transfected with HLA-DR1 as APC for the CII peptide, while Cop 1 had no effect on this CII-specific T cell response (Table 1, Figure 3A). Interestingly, HA 306 ­318 (#4) inhibited both 3.19 and 19.3 T-cell clones very efficiently (Table 1, Figure 3A). For HLA-DR4-restricted T cells, using L fibroblasts transfected with HLA-DR4 as APC, the following pattern of activity was obtained: peptides #6, 11, 16, 17, 22, 23, 27, 28, and 33 were good inhibitors of 3838 T-cell clone, whereas D3 was inhibited best by peptides #8, 15, 16, 18, and 27 (Table 1, Figure 3B). Again, Cop 1 had a minimal effect on the CII-specific T cell response (Table 1, Figure 3B). On the other hand, HA 306 ­318 inhibited both 3838 and D3 T cell clones less efficiently than the 3.19 and 19.3 clones (Table 1, Figure 3B). Peptides that inhibited these HLA-DR1 and -DR4restricted CII 261­273-specific T-cell clones most effi-

ciently were further titrated to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (Figure 4). Similarly to the experiment described in Table 1 and Figure 3, peptides #4, 15, 26, and 32 were the best inhibitors of HLA-DR1restricted T-cell clone 3.19 at the ratio of 2.5 inhibitor/ antigen, whereas the 19.3 T-cell clone was inhibited best by peptides #15, 26, and 27 (Figure 4A). HLA-DR4restricted T-cell clones 3838 and D3 were inhibited by several peptides better than by HA 306 ­318 (Figure 4B). In contrast, Cop 1 had a minimal inhibitory effect on both HLA-DR1- and -DR4-restricted CII 261­273specific T-cell clones (Figure 4A and 4B). DISCUSSION In this report, the competition of peptide 15-mers synthesized based on Cop 1 binding motifs with Cop 1, the high affinity HA 306 ­318 epitope and an immunodominant T-cell epitope CII 261­273 for binding to the RA-associated HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules is analyzed. Moreover, some of these peptides, particularly those with residue K at P-1 or K at P8 of the bound peptide, inhibited type II collagen-specific HLA-DR1and -DR4-restricted T-cell clones.

Irradiated L cells transfected with HLA-DR1 (L57.23) (A) or HLA- DR4 (B) were coincubated in duplicate with CII 261­273 (40 g/ml) and peptides (200 g/ml) for 2 h at 37°C, then T cells [clones 3.19 or 19.3 (A), 3838 or D3 (B)] were added and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Supernatants (30 l) were incubated with IL2-dependent CTLL, followed by labeling with 3H- thymidine (1 Ci/well) for 12 h. Results (cpm) represent mean of duplicates of one representative experiment. Peptides 8, 15, 26, and 27 inhibited completely the T-cell clones (shown as 0 cpm, lower panels). Other details are as described in the Materials and Methods section.

Promiscuous binding of nearly the entire mixture of Cop 1 components to the groove of purified HLA-DR molecules has been reported [47, 50]. These data suggested that the active fractions of Cop 1 all contained amino acid sequences essential for binding to these molecules. Indeed, digestion of Cop 1 bound to HLA-DR1, -DR2, and -DR4 molecules with aminopeptidase I to remove the protruding ends of the copolymer revealed binding motifs, which were distinct from those of the untreated mixture of random polypeptides, for example, increases in levels of E at the first and second cycles, of K at the second and third cycles, and of Y (presumably at P1 of the bound peptide) at the third to fifth cycles, regardless of the HLA-DR molecule used (except that increase in A at cycles 3­5 was also evident in binding to HLA-DR2). No preference was seen at the following cycles which were mainly A. For direct characterization of Cop 1 epitopes bound to HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules, different peptides were synthesized according to Cop 1 and HLA-DR1 and -DR4 binding motifs, particularly as it relates to the anchor and TCR contact residues of the high affinity epitope HA 306 ­318. Peptides were divided into three groups with regard to the HLA-DR molecule, its anchor positions, and residues interacting with the TCR. Out of 33 peptides only

several inhibited binding of HA 306 ­318 and Cop 1 to recombinant HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules. These peptides were heterogeneous in the sequence of amino acids. Peptides that inhibited binding of HA 306 ­318 or Cop 1 to HLA-DR1 or -DR4 molecules all contained Y at P1 (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2), as expected [11]. Interestingly, peptides with K at P8 were better inhibitors of antigen binding to HLA-DR1 than these same peptides in which K was substituted by A at P8 (Table 1). In the crystal structure of the HA 306 ­318/HLADR1 complex residue K at P8 points upwards and laterally and has been mainly considered as a TCR contact residue. Unexpectedly, however, it may also contribute to the overall stability of the peptide/MHC interactions by interacting with the side chains of the HLA-DR1 chain, possibly with N 69 [11]. In addition, peptides with K at P-1 or to a lesser extent at P-2 bound to HLA-DR1 molecules with higher affinity compared to the same peptides in which K at these positions was substituted for A (Table 1, Figure 1). The enrichment of K near the N-termini of naturally processed peptides bound to HLA-DR1 was previously observed and mistakenly interpreted as an anchor residue [33]. These residues may contribute to the stable interactions of Cop 1 with the HLA-DR molecules and the

FIGURE 4 Inhibition of IL-2 production by HLA-DR1 (A) and HLA-DR4 (B) restricted CII-specific T-cell hybridomas in the presence of several peptides. Irradiated L cells transfected with HLA-DR1 (L57.23) (A) or HLA-DR4 (B) were coincubated in duplicate with CII 261­273 (40 g/ml) and different concentrations of the peptides for 2 h at 37° C, then T cells [clones 3.19 or 19.3 (A), 3838 or D3 (B)] were added and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Other details are as in the legend for Figure 2.

TCR, similarly to residue K at P-1 of HA 306 ­318 complexed with HLA-DR1, which can interact with the side chains of 1 helix residues at S 53 or E 55 [11]. In another structure, however, the side chain of D at P-1 was positioned in the opposite direction and interacted with H 81 [59]. Residue E at P-2 did not affect the affinity of peptide binding. However, both E and K prior to Y at P1 increased the peptide affinity (Table 1). Also, substitution of K at P-1 in HA 306 ­318 was earlier shown both to reduce binding to some HLA-DR1 and -DR4 subtypes [60] and to anergize HA 306 ­318specific DR1-restricted human T-cell clones [61]. In contrast to HLA-DR1, a greater number of peptides inhibited binding of both HA 306 ­318 and Cop 1 to HLA-DR4 molecules (Table 1). These peptides contained Y at P1 and either K or A at P8, with no preference for other positions (Table 1). This observation

is in line with the fact that HLA-DR1 and -DR4 share similar peptide binding properties [11, 14, 31­34, 36, 57, 62, 63]. It should be noted that the affinity of the HA 306 ­318 for recombinant HLA-DR4 was lower, and that of Cop 1 higher than for HLA-DR1 molecules, similarly to the case with purified human HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules [47]. The effect of residue K at P-1 or at P-2 on the peptide binding to HLA-DR4 molecules was less pronounced compared with HLA-DR1 binding (Table 1). Interestingly, the binding of some of the biotinylated peptides to either HLA-DR1 or -DR4 was inhibited by CII 261­273, as well as by HA 306 ­318 and Cop 1 (data not shown), suggesting that these peptides may compete for presentation to CII-reactive T cells, similar to the whole Cop 1 mixture [47]. Of major importance is the observation that several synthetic peptides inhibited type II collagen-specific Tcell clones. These peptides all had Y at P1 and either K or A at P8, as well as K at P-1 or P-2 (Table 1). Recent studies have shown the inhibitory potential of several random copolymers composed of the three amino acids out of Y, E, A, and K found in Cop 1. These copolymers, especially poly (Y, A, and K), competed with CII 261­ 273 for binding to RA-associated HLA-DR1 and -DR4 molecules, and inhibited CII-reactive T-cell clones [49]. Interestingly, one of the Cop 1-related peptides, which

648

was composed of Y, A, and K (#8), inhibited HLA-DR4restricted type II collagen-reactive T cells very efficiently, suggesting that a single Y, A, and K peptide might be substituted for the whole mixture of random polypeptides poly (Y, A, and K). These individual peptides composed of Y, E, A, and K representing Cop 1 components all with P1 residues fitting particular HLA-DR molecule (in this case Y at P1) may substitute for the whole mixture of random polypeptides. Peptide stability may be improved by introducing residues E and K prior to P1, thus increasing the affinity of the interactions between peptide/MHC complexes and the TCR. Once bound to the groove of HLA-DR molecules, they may act as either a blocking peptide or as an antagonist or partial agonist, resulting in suppression of autoimmune T-cell responses (e.g., by induction of T-suppressor cells) or anergy, or both. Further studies, particularly using in vivo murine models of RA, will indicate whether any of these peptides are potentially useful in the treatment of RA in humans.
