The Structure of a pH-Sensing Mycobacterial Adenylyl Cyclase Holoenzyme
Ivo Tews,1*. Felix Findeisen,1* Irmgard Sinning,1 Anita Schultz,2 ® Joachim E. Schultz,2 Jurgen U. Linder2.
Class III adenylyl cyclases contain catalytic and regulatory domains, yet structural insight into their interactions is missing. We show that the mycobacterial adenylyl cyclase Rv1264 is rendered a pH sensor by its N-terminal domain. In the structure of the inhibited state, catalytic and regulatory domains share a large interface involving catalytic residues. In the structure of the active state, the two catalytic domains rotate by 55- to form two catalytic sites at their interface. Two a helices serve as molecular switches. Mutagenesis is consistent with a regulatory role of the structural transition, and we suggest that the transition is regulated by pH. Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) synthesize the universal second messenger 3∂,5∂-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (1). Most ACs belong to class III, such as all mammalian and many bacterial enzymes (2), and are multidomain proteins (2, 3). In the genome of the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4), 15 putative class III ACs (5) with eight different domain compositions have been identified. For comparison, the similarly sized genome of Escherichia coli contains a single AC gene, and even in the human genome only 10 AC genes have been identified (6, 7). This suggests that mycobacteria can respond to changing extra- and intracellular conditions by cAMP formation. The mycobacterial AC Rv1264 is autoinhibited by its N-terminal domain (8). A knockout of the single Streptomyces AC, which has an identical domain composition to Rv1264, abolishes the bacterial response to an acidic milieu that affects differentiation processes (9). Because M. tuberculosis must counteract acidification of phagolysosomes during host invasion for intracellular survival (10, 11), we examined the pH sensitivity of Rv1264 (Fig. 1A) (12). At pH 8, AC activity was 3 nmol of

pH 6, AC activity increased almost 40-fold to 115 nmol and Vmax increased 12-fold to 420 nmol of cAMP&mgj1&minj1. The substrate affinity increased slightly to 0.8 mM ATP. The Hill coefficient of 1.9 was unaffected. In contrast, the isolated catalytic domain (Rv1264211-397) displayed uniformly high AC activity between pH 5.5 and 8 (Fig. 1A). Thus, in Rv1264, pH sensitivity is mediated by a distinct regulatory domain, and the activation by far exceeds the usual pH dependence of an enzyme. Biochemically, Rv1264 qualifies as a pH-sensing AC and is a likely candidate for mycobacterial pH sensing. To understand the molecular mechanism of pH sensing and AC regulation, two crystal forms of Rv1264 were analyzed (12). Anisotropic crystals in a hexagonal space group with a diffraction limit of 3.3 ) were grown from Li2SO4, and the resulting model was designated the active form of Rv1264 (Fig. 2A); the 2.3 ) resolution structure obtained from monoclinic crystals grown from polyethylene glycol was designated the inhibited

form (Fig. 2B and table S1). The designation was based on the structural and ensuing mutagenic analysis (13). Both structures have three discrete segments, a rigid N-terminal domain (amino acids 14 to 191), a flexible linker region (amino acids 192 to 213) (Fig. 2, red), and the C-terminal catalytic domain (amino acids 214 to 377). We determined the structures using molecular replacement techniques with the dimer of N-terminal domains as a search model (determined previously to 1.6 ) resolution) (14). In all three structures, the N-terminal dimer comprises 20 a helices and has a disc-like shape of 80 by 50 by 20 )3, with an internal contact surface of 5500 )2. Dimerization involves a crossover of protein chains by threading of the aN10 helix of one monomer through the central coiled coil of the other monomer (helices aN4, aN7, aN8, aN9, and aN10) (Fig. 2, A and B). This results in a domain arrangement for Rv1264 in which the regulatory domain of monomer A contacts the catalytic domain of monomer B and vice versa (Figs. 2 and 3A). Residues 60 to 191 of the regulatory domain are essentially identical in both states of the holoenzyme and can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.42 ) over 264 Ca positions. The catalytic domains in the active state (Fig. 2A) are arranged head-to-tail in the wreath-like quaternary structure known from the C2 homodimer of rat AC type II (15) (fig. S1), as well as from the G protein≠activated heterodimer of canine AC type V C1 and rat AC type II C2 catalytic domains (16). Although sequence identities between the Rv1264 and mammalian catalytic domains were low, with 22% to canine C1 and 25% to rat C2, the catalytic dimer of Rv1264 superimposes well with the mammalian heterodimer (rmsd of 1.76 ) over 256 out of 324 Ca positions). It is more compact than the mammalian catalytic domain because of several slightly shortened loops (fig. S2). A 7≠amino acid gap obliterating the so-called dimerization arm (2, 8, 16) (fig. S2) is the major reason for a reduction of the interface from 3800 )2 in the mammalian heterodimer to 1900 )2 in the Rv1264 activestate homodimer. The known catalytic residues of class III ACs (2, 17, 18) in Rv1264 (Asp222, Lys261, Asp265, Arg298, Asp312, Asn319, and Arg323) (Fig. 3, B and C, and fig. S2) are in almost identical positions to those in the mammalian heterodimer (19). A superposition of these residues of one active site gave an rmsd of 0.69 ) over the Ca positions and 1.17 ) over all atoms (Fig. 3B). The phosphatecoordinating residues Arg298 and Arg323 in Rv1264 bind to a sulfate ion located in the position of the b phosphate of the substrate ATP, as confirmed by modeling ATP into the active site of Rv1264 by superposition with noncylizable adenosine 5∂-(1-thiotriphosphate) (ATPaS-Rp) from the mammalian heterodimeric structure (19). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the Rv1264 structure shown in Fig. 2A represents the active state of the enzyme. The inhibited state of Rv1264 is characterized by a disassembled active site (Fig. 3C). The transition from the active to the inhibited state is accompanied by a marked change in tertiary structure (Fig. 2). Each of the two catalytic domains is rotated by 55- and translated by 6 ) with respect to the fixed regulatory domains (Fig. 3A and movie S1). The catalytic residues move by up to 25 ) during this transition (Fig. 3C). In the inhibited state, residues from a single active site were »40 ) apart. Additionally, the

interface between the two catalytic domains was reduced from 1900 )2 in the active state to 930 )2 in the inhibited state, whereas that between regulatory and catalytic domains was increased from 1500 )2 in the active state to 2800 )2 in the inhibited state. Two regions, called switch elements, undergo major structural changes (Fig. 2, red). The a1-switch helix (residues 226 to 231), located within the catalytic domain (Figs. 2A and 3D), is also present in the mammalian structures and contributes to binding of the b/g-phosphates (18). There, the a1-switch helix and the adjacent loop to a2 form the binding site for the heterotrimeric G protein subunits Gsa and Gia that regulate the activity of mammalian ACs (15). In the active state of Rv1264, the a1switch is in a helical conformation as in the mammalian enzymes. However, in the inhibited state, it changes into a random coil with the Ca atoms moving by up to 11 ) (Fig. 3D). The second switch element, the aN10 switch, comprises residues 192 to 206 in the linker region and undergoes the most noticeable changes between the two states (Fig. 2). 13 MAY 2005 VOL 308 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org

In the active state, it assumes a random coil conformation with a short helical segment (residues 202 to 206) (Fig. 2A) loosely connecting regulatory and catalytic domains. High B factors in this region are consistent with a high mobility that allows the catalytic domains to assemble both active sites. In the inhibited state, this segment forms an a helix with low B values, extending the aN10-helix of the regulatory domain by 24 ) or four turns (Fig. 2B) to keep the catalytic domains apart. The newly formed helical turns participate in the interface between regulatory and catalytic domains. To test whether the integrity of the helical segment is a prerequisite of pH regulation, two consecutive prolines were introduced at the beginning of the aN10-switch. Because of their restricted F and Y-values, this was not compatible with an a-helical conformation (20). In the M193P/ M194P double mutant, pH regulation was lost, and the activity of the mutant holoenzyme over the pH range of 5.5 to 8 is similar to that of activated wild-type protein at pH 5.5 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the extension of the aN10 switch helix is a determinant of the inhibited state. Two residues in the aN10-switch helix, identified by mutagenesis, are important for the interaction between the regulatory and catalytic domains (Fig. 4C). One site of interaction comprises Asp62, Tyr66, Glu195, and Arg309 (Fig. 4A). The arginine points into a crevice in the regulatory domain and organizes the other residues through formation of hydrogen bonds. An R309A mutation renders the holoenzyme active and unregulated (Fig. 1C). The same mutation in the isolated catalytic domain (Rv1264211-397R309A) has no effect (21). Additionally, an E195A mutation partially relieves the inhibition, results in a fourfold increase in activity at pH 8.0, and shifts the pH optimum from pH 5.8 to pH 6.5 (Fig. 1C). A further site of interaction at the beginning of the aN10-switch helix forms around His192 (Fig. 4B). The catalytic residues Lys261 and Asp312 are held 14 ) and 21 ) away from their respective positions in the active state by an interaction with His192 (Figs. 3C and 4B). A H192A mutant shows the wild-type phenotype at pH 8, but the slope of activation is shifted by 0.5 pH units toward the acidic pH (Fig. 1D). At acidic pH, His192 is expected to be protonated, and the positive charge may result in electrostatic repulsion of Lys261. Similarly, a H192E mutant has a 10fold higher activity at pH 8.0 than the wildtype protein, indicating that a negative charge at this position interferes with Asp312 (Fig. 1D). The data indicate that there is no designated, single amino acid residue that acts as a pH receptor, but that a network of hydrogen and ionic bonds in the interface between catalytic and regulatory domains mediate pH sensitivity and responsiveness. Because of the structural similarities between the catalytic domains of both AC Rv1264 and mammalian ACs, the a1 and the aN10 switch regions may be prototypical regulatory elements for class III ACs. In the active state of Rv1264, the catalytic domains align even in the absence of bound nucleotide, whereas the regulatory domains effectively impede this alignment in the inhibited state. The comparison with mammalian enzymes shows that, in all class III ACs, activity is tuned by the alignment of the catalytic dimer. The mode of interaction may differ, but the repositioning of catalytic domains organized by a common structural switch may prove to be a general principle as more AC holoenzyme structures become available.

The inhibited form of Rv1264 was determined from a crystal grown at pH 5.5 and the active form from a crystal grown at pH 7.5. These pH values are in contrast to the activity assays. A discrepancy between crystallization conditions and activity assays is not unusual, however; the structure of the Gsa-activated mammalian AC (1CJK) (16) has been crystallized at pH 5.4, two units below the pH of both the in vivo environment of the enzyme and the in vitro activity assay. Rv1264 exists in equilibrium between active and inhibited states that are governed by pH in our in vitro assay (Fig. 1A). For crystallization, other factors such as the different dielectric constants (PEG400 versus Li2SO4) can override the effect of pH on this equilibrium. Indeed, both the active and inhibited states of Rv1264 crystallize at the same pH: The needle-shaped crystals of the active state are obtained over a pH range from pH 5.4 to pH 7.5. These crystals all have the same distinctive morphology, which strongly suggests that they all represent the enzyme in the active state, and are easily distinguished from those crystals of the enzyme in the inhibited state. The needle-shaped crystals are usually 1 to 5 mm in diameter and not suitable for diffraction analysis, but one crystal grown to a diameter of »20 mm at pH 7.5 ∞ diffracted to 3.3 A at the beamline ID13 in Grenoble.

Structural Basis of Energy Transduction in the Transport Cycle of MsbA
Jinhui Dong, Guangyong Yang, Hassane S. Mchaourab*
We used site-directed spin-labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize the conformational motion that couples energy expenditure to substrate translocation in the multidrug transporter MsbA. In liposomes, ligand-free MsbA samples conformations that depart from the crystal structures, including looser packing and water penetration along the periplasmic side. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding closes the substrate chamber to the cytoplasm while increasing hydration at the periplasmic side, consistent with an alternating access model. Accentuated by ATP hydrolysis, the changes in the chamber dielectric environment and its geometry provide the likely driving force for flipping amphipathic substrates and a potential exit pathway. These results establish the structural dynamic basis of the power stroke in multidrug-resistant ATP-binding cassette (MDR ABC) transporters. ABC transporters transduce the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis into the mechanical work of substrate translocation across SCIENCE VOL 308 cell membranes (1≠3). The functional unit consists of two nucleotide binding and hydrolysis domains (NBDs), each coupled to a
