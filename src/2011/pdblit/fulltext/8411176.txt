Two translational inhibitors (pokeweed antiviral protein and pokeweed antiviral protein II) isolated from the leaves of the pokeweed plant, Phytolacca americana, were characterized as to their behavior during reverse-phase H P L C and their amino-terminal sequences. Alignment of the sequences demonstrated that a substantial degree of homology was present (I0 of 29 identical residues). Pokeweed antiviral protein was shown by reverse-phase chromatography to be composed of at least two components, pokeweed antiviral protein a and pokeweed antiviral proteinb, which comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, shared identical N-terminal amino-acid sequences through residue 31, and had similar specific activities in a cell-free translation inhibition assay. Pokeweed antiviral protein II was covalently coupled to a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the transferrin receptor (anti-transferrin receptor). The disulfide-linked conjugate inhibited protein synthesis in the human breast tumor cell line MCF-7, whereas anti-transferrin receptor, pokeweed antiviral protein II, or an immunotoxin composed of an irrelevant antiserum and pokeweed antiviral protein II, were nontoxic. The inhibitory dose 50% of anti-transferrin receptor-pokeweed antiviral protein II for MCF-7 cells was 0.7 nM, whereas the corresponding ricin A chain conjugate (anti-transferrin receptor-ricin A chain) was more potent with a inhibitory dose 50% of 0.I nM. Pokeweed antiviral protein II can be added to the growing list of translation inhibitors that are effective as components of immunotoxins in vitro. Additional studies will be needed to determine whether pokeweed antiviral protein II immunotoxins provide advantageous properties for in vivo applications.

Introduction

Recently, immunotoxins have gained widespread scientific interest because of their ability to kill selected cell populations (for reviews, see Refs. 1 and 2). Antibodies, either monoclonal or polyclonal, provide the cell-binding function of immunotoxins, while the effector portion is a poly* Present address: Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Center Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, U.S.A. 0167-4838/84/$03.00 © 1984 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

peptide with the ability to inhibit eukaryotic protein synthesis. Historically, the most commonly used effector moieties (A chains or A fragments) were components of ricin and diphtheria toxins. Ricin toxin A chain and diphtheria toxin A fragment destroy the protein-synthesizing machinery of eukaryotic cells in an enzymatic manner. Yamaizuma et al. [3] and Eiklid et al. [4] have shown that the introduction of a single molecule of diphtheria toxin A fragment or ricin A chain into the cytoplasm of a cell can result in cell death.

155 In their natural state ricin A chain and diphtheria toxin A fragment are associated with a second protein moiety (B chain or B fragment) that is responsible for binding to receptor molecules on cell surfaces; both the A and B moieties are required for cell cytotoxicity. The presence of trace quantities of B chains or whole toxins in a conjugation mixture can complicate the analysis of the specific target cell cytotoxicity of ricin A chainor diphtheria toxin A fragment-based immunotoxins. Other effector molecules, found in a number of different plants, are not associated with a receptor binding moiety. These 'A-chain'-like proteins, such as gelonin [5,6] momordin [7,8] dianthins [9] and the Phytolacca americana proteins [10-13], resemble ricin A chain in that they enzymatically inhibit eukaryotic protein synthesis with similar specific activities. The pokeweed, P. americana, contains at least three distinct translational inhibitors [10-13]. Pokeweed antiviral protein and pokeweed antiviral protein II are harvested from spring and summer leaves, respectively, whereas a third inhibitor is obtained from pokeweed seeds. Houston et al. [14] sequenced the amino-terminal residues of pokeweed antiviral protein and the seed protein, and demonstrated extensive homology between these two proteins; pokeweed antiviral protein II was not analyzed in that report. Here we provide the amino-terminal sequence of pokeweed antiviral protein II and demonstrate homology between pokeweed antiviral protein II and the other pokeweed antiviral proteins. In addition, we have utilized pokeweed antiviral protein II as a component of an immunotoxin and show that the immunotoxin was cytocidal to a human breast tumor cell line in vitro.
Materials and Methods

Translation inhibitors. Purified pokeweed antiviral protein II and pokeweed antiviral protein [10,12] were supplied by DR. James Irvin, Southwest Texas State University, San Marcos. Ricin toxin was prepared from castor beans (Ricinus communis var. sanquinea) obtained from ParkeDavis. Castor beans were ground in 5% acetic acid in order to extract the toxin. The extract was

chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4)/100 m M lactose. Sugar binding and charge differences between ricin A and ricin B chain allow for their purification from one another using galactose-containing resins and ion-exchange chromatography [15]. Thus, the ricin toxin fractions were pooled, reduced with 100 mM dithiothreitol and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0)/3% ( v / v ) 2mercaptoethanol. The nonbinding ricin toxin A chain was further chromatographed away from ricin B chain by chromatography on a CM-cellulose column equilibrated in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5)/2 m M E D T A / 1 m M dithiothreitol (buffer A) and eluted with an NaC1 gradient in buffer A. Ricin A chain prepared in this manner was 1000-10000-fold less toxic to tissue culture cells and mice than was ricin toxin. Reagents. N-Succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate was from Pharmacia and 2-iminothiolane was from Pierce. L-[35S]Methionine at 11.68 m C i / m l (1270 C i / m m o l ) was purchased from Amersham. Antibodies. Polyclonal h u m a n I g G was purchased from Cappel Labs. To produce monoclonal antibodies to the human transferrin receptor, B a l b / c mice were immunized and boosted i.p. with detergent-solubilized K562 cell membranes. Monoclonal antibodies to the transferrin receptor were prepared by poly(ethylene glycol) fusion of S P 2 / 0 myeloma cells with splenocytes from immunized animals [16]. Supernatants were screened for binding to K562 cells, T-cell lines and purified Triton X-100-solubilized transferrin receptors. Anti-transferrin receptor of the IgG2a class was shown to immunoprecipitate the 94 kDa transferrin receptor from human placenta, human K562 cells, and human lymphoblastoid cell lines. Cell line. The human breast tumor cell line MCF-7 was obtained from Mason Research Institute, Worcester, MA (U.S.A.), and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 0.1 t~g/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 2 mM glutamine and antibioticantimycotic (Gibco). MCF-7 was grown under 9% CO 2 at 37 oC. H P L C reverse-phase chromatography of pokeweed antiviral protein and pokeweed antiviral pro-

tein II. The H P L C instrument consisted of the following components: two Beckman Model 112 pumps, a Rheodyne Model 7125 injector with a 500 ~1 sample loop, a Beckman Model 420 or 421 Controller and a Model 160 detector. A Vydac C-4 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Rainin) was used for reverse-phase chromatography. Running conditions were: 1 m l / m i n at room temperature using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce) as buffer A and 60% acetonitrile (Burdick and Johnson), 0.1% in trifluoroacetic acid as buffer B. The acetonitrile gradient was at 50% buffer B in A + B and developed at a rate of 1.1% buffer B / m i n . N H,-terminal sequencing. NHz-terminal sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase sequencer. Reagents and solvents for the instrument were supplied by the manufacturer. Following conversion of the anilinothiazolinones to their PTH-derivatives in 25% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, reverse-phase H P L C was utilized for amino acid identification. The chromatography system described by Johnson et al. [17] using a cyanopropyl support and an acetonitrile/methanol gradient in sodium acetate at p H 5.8 was employed. The H P L C instrumentation consisted of the components listed above with the addition of a second model 160 detector. The two detectors were arranged such that the absorbance of the column effluent was measured first at 254 nm and subsequently at 313 nm. Automatic sample injections were carried out with a WISP model 710B from Waters. Conjugate construction. Anti-transferrin receptor and human IgG in phosphate buffered saline (each at 2 m g / m l ) were derivatized with a 10-fold molar excess of the heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate [18]. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with occasional mixing, and extensively dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline at 4°C. About two pyridyl 2-disulfide residues were incorporated per antibody molecule, as assayed by measuring the release of pyridine 2-thione following reduction with dithiothreitol [18]. Pokeweed antiviral protein II (2 m g / m l ) was chemically modified using N-succinimidyl 3-(2pyridyldithio)propionate as above, except that a 2.5-fold molar excess of input N-succinimidyl 3(2-pyridyldithio)propionate to pokeweed antiviral

protein II was used. On the average, about one pyridyl 2-disulfide residue was incorporated into each molecule of pokeweed antiviral protein II. Following dialysis, pyridyldisulfide-pokeweed antiviral protein II was reduced with 50 mM dithiothreitol (30 min at room temperature) and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline. The peak protein fractions were pooled and mixed with pyridyldisulfide-antibody. The final concentrations of derivatized pokeweed antiviral protein II and pyridyldisulfide-antibody in the reaction mixture were 16 and 8 ~M, respectively. The conjugation reaction, followed by monitoring the change in A343, was essentially complete within 5 h. Anti-transferrin receptor-ricin A chain conjugate was constructed by mixing freshly reduced and desalted ricin A chain (unmodified) with pyridyldisulfide-modified anti-transferrin receptor as described above. A second cross-linking protocol was developed to eliminate the reduction and desalting steps in the above procedure. Antibody (anti-transferrin receptor) was chemically modified using 2-iminothiolane [19,20] in order to introduce free sulfhydryl groups directly. Briefly, 2-iminothiolane (20 m M in methanol) was added to antibody (2 m g / m l ) in an 83-fold molar excess. Following gentle mixing for 30 min at room temperature, the modified antibody was dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline. The number of sulfhydryl groups introduced, determined spectrophotometrically with dithionitrobenzoic acid [21], was about two per antibody molecule. The derivatized antibody was then mixed with pyridyldisulfide-pokeweed antiviral protein II (not reduced; input molar ratio of two pokeweed antiviral protein I I / A b ) . The extent of conjugation was approximately equivalent as measured by pyridine 2-thione release or sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. H P L C size-exclusion chromatography of conjugates. The instrumentation consisted of a Waters model U 6 K injector with a 2 ml injection loop, a 6000A solvent delivery pump, and a Model 480 detector. Samples (250 ~1) were chromatographed on a Bio-Rad TSK-250 column (7.5 x 300 mm) at a flow rate of 1 m l / m i n . The mobile phase was 0.1 M Na2SO4/0.02 M N a H 2 P O 4 (pH 6.8).

Tissue culture ~ytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the ability of MCF-7 cells to incorporate radiolabeled methionine into cellular protein following incubation with test substances. Cells ( 5 . 1 0 4 in 1 ml medium) were seeded in 8 ml glass vials (ICN) and dilutions of test proteins were added. After incubation at 37 o C for 22 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml medium lacking unlabeled methionine but supplemented with 1 ~Ci [35S]methionine. Following a 2 h incubation, the medium was aspirated, the monolayer was washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 m g / m l methionine, and the vials were dried. The vials were counted following the addition of 3 ml 4a20 scintillation fluid containing 20% (v/v) Triton X-100. Toxicity is expressed as the concentration of test substance required to inhibit protein synthesis by 50% in a 24 h assay (inhibitory dose 50%).

Biochemical characterization of pokeweed antiviral protein II and pokeweed antiviral protein Reverse-phase chromatography of proteins can be particularly useful in analyzing the purity and homogeneity of proteins isolated by methods that resolve components based on molecular mass, charge or ligand binding. When pokeweed antiviral protein II was chromatographed on a reverse-phase C4 column, a single symmetrical peak was observed (Fig. 1A) that also gave a single band upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr 31 000; Fig. 2). In contrast, when pokeweed antiviral protein was chromatographed under identical conditions, two peaks were apparent (Fig. 1B). Both eluted much later in the acetonitrile gradient than did pokeweed antiviral protein II, thus eliminating the possibility that heterogeneity was due to pokeweed antiviral protein II contamination of the pokeweed antiviral protein preparation. We have designated the pokeweed antiviral protein components pokeweed antiviral proteina (eluting first) and pokeweed antiviral protein b. Close

Proteins were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, then 50 /tg were injected and eluted using a linear acetonitrile gradient. The acetonitrile gradient (dashed line) (50-100%) was developed over a 45 min period.

inspection of the pokeweed antiviral protein a peak disclosed that it was actually composed of two components, whereas pokeweed antiviral protein b appeared to be homogeneous by this analysis (Fig. 1B). Pokeweed antiviral protein a and pokeweed antiviral protein b both inhibited protein synthesis in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation assay system (data not shown) and co-migrated upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at a molecular weight of 29 kDa (Fig. 2). The cause of the heterogeneity of pokeweed antiviral protein is unexplained. The following results make it unlikely that the heterogeneity of

159 weed antiviral protein II as a component of an immunotoxin has not been reported, we focused our attention of this protein. A monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor was chosen as the cell-binding moiety, since this protein enters cells by a high efficiency internalization pathway (Larrick, J., unpublished data). Hybrids between other antibodies to the transferrin receptor and toxin moieties have previously been shown to result in potent cytotoxins in vitro [24,26,27]. One of the advantages of using the conventional toxin A chains (ricin A chain and diphtheria toxin A fragment) as components of immunotoxins is that each has a single reactive cysteine residue through which coupling to an antibody can be directed. Titration of nonreduced pokeweed antiviral protein II with the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent dithionitrobenzoic acid, either in the presence or absence of the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate, showed that this protein, like pokeweed antiviral protein [14], lacked free sulfhydryl groups. Thus, all four half-cystines of pokeweed antiviral protein II [12] are probably involved in intrachain disulfide bonds. In order to introduce reactive groups into pokeweed antiviral protein II that would allow conjugation to antibody, we utilized the crosslinking reagent N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate developed by Carlson et al. [18]. This reagent has spectral properties that facilitate the spectrophotometric quantitation of protein modification and protein-protein conjugation. When pokeweed antiviral protein II was chemically modified with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate under the conditions described in Materials and Methods, about one titratable pyridine 2-thione group was introduced per pokeweed antiviral protein II molecule. The pyridyl disulfide derivative of pokeweed antiviral protein II was subsequently reduced and desalted, yielding pokeweed antiviral protein II-SH. As measured by rabbit reticulocyte translation inhibition, the enzymatic activity of pokeweed antiviral protein II was unchanged following chemical modification with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate or following reduction of either pokeweed antiviral protein II or pyridyl disulfidepokeweed antiviral protein II. The reaction of pokeweed antiviral protein IISH with pyridyl disulfide-antibody (Fig. 5A) introduced about two molecules of pokeweed antiviral protein II per antibody molecule (average value). The conjugate preparation also contained about 20% unconjugated antibody. When freshly reduced native pokeweed antiviral protein II was mixed with pyridyl disulfide-antibody, no pokeweed antiviral protein II-antibody conjugate was formed as determined by either sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or release of pyridine 2-thione.

160 gests that the disulfides of pokeweed antiviral protein II reform rapidly (in minutes) after removal of reducing agent, a n d / o r that the cysteine residues are buried within the molecule in an environment inaccessible to reactive groups on large proteins, e.g., immunoglobulin molecules. A second crosslinking procedure, involving the direct incorporation of sulfhydryl groups into antibody using the reagent 2-iminothiolane (2-imino t e t r a h y d r o t h i o p h e n e ; formerly methyl 4mercaptobutyrimidate) was developed (Fig. 5B). Like N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate, 2-iminothiolane preferentially modifies the epsilon amino group of lysine residues of proteins [19,20]. The use of this reagent simplified the conjugation procedure by decreasing the number of manipulations, e.g., reduction and desalting, that were necessary when using the N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate method depicted in Fig. 5A. The efficiency of conjugation was approximately equivalent using either method depicted in Fig. 5. An alternative to the scheme outlined in Fig. 5B would be to use 2-iminothiolane to introduce sulfhydryl groups directly into pokeweed antiviral protein II. The 2-iminothiolane modified pokeweed antiviral protein II could then be mixed with pyridyldisulfide-antibody, resulting in a disulfide linked antibody-pokeweed antiviral protein II conjugate. This latter method has also been used, and results in efficient cross-linking and cytocidal immunotoxins. Following construction, the conjugates were fractionated by HPLC size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6). In this system, IgG antibodies elute as a relatively sharp peak at fraction 27 and pokeweed antiviral protein II at fraction 33. When conjugate mixture was chromatographed in this system, residual pokeweed antiviral protein II eluted at its expected position and the conjugate eluted as a broad series of high-molecular-weight components (fractions 19-27). The broad conjugate peaks are most likely a result of heterogeneity in the number of pokeweed antiviral protein II molecules cross-linked to antibody as well as some aggregation into large molecular weight species that elute near the void volume of the column. Fractions containing the conjugate (fractions 19-27) and pokeweed antiviral protein II (fraction 33) inhibited protein synthesis in a

In order to determine the potency of the antibody-pokeweed antiviral protein II complex, a series of conjugate dilutions was tested against the breast tumor cell line MCF-7 (Fig. 7). The antitransferrin-pokeweed antiviral protein II conjugate was a potent immunotoxin, with a inhibitory dose 50% of 0.7 nM. Neither pokeweed antiviral protein II alone nor anti-transferrin receptor alone was toxic to MCF-7 cells in this 24 h assay, nor was a conjugate made between polyclonal human IgG (nonbinding to MCF-7) and pokeweed antiviral protein II (human IgG-pokeweed antiviral protein II; Fig. 7). Finally, the anti-transferrin receptorpokeweed antiviral protein II conjugate was nontoxic to mouse L929 cells, consistent with the fact that anti-transferrin receptor does not bind to this cell line. These observations demonstrate that both the cell binding (antibody) and effector (pokeweed antiviral protein II) portions of the conjugate are required for expression of toxicity.

the leveling-off effect in the 24 h protein synthesis assay (Fig. 7) was not due to genotypically resistant cells. It is likely that the leveling-off effect was caused by either a slow rate of killing by the conjugate or physiological cycling of cells through resistant and sensitive stages during the cell cycle.

The dashed line represents 50% control protein synthesis.

An anti-transferrin-ricin A chain conjugate resuited in a inhibitory dose 50% of 0.1 nM when tested against MCF-7 (Fig. 7), whereas an antitransferrin receptor-diphtheria toxin A fragment conjugate was less toxic, with a inhibitory dose 50% of 5 nM (data not shown). Thus, the antitransferrin receptor-pokeweed antiviral protein II conjugate was intermediate in toxicity between the ricin A chain and diphtheria toxin A fragment conjugates. In addition to the difference in toxicities of the ricin A chain and pokeweed antiviral protein II conjugates as measured by inhibitory dose 50% values, the ricin A chain conjugate, but not the pokeweed antiviral protein II conjugate, decreased protein synthesis below 5% of control levels at high conjugate concentrations. With anti-transferrin receptor-pokeweed antiviral protein II, the extent of protein synthesis inhibition leveled off at about 30% control protein synthesis even at very high doses (approx. 10 nM) of conjugate. We were concerned that this leveling-off phenomenon was due to a surviving resistant (to anti-transferrin receptor-pokeweed antiviral protein II) population of MCF-7 cells. However, anti-transferrin receptor-pokeweed antiviral protein II (0.1 nm) was able to eliminate all the plated cells (200) in a 7 day clonegenic assay. This result demonstrates that

The P. americana translational inhibitors represent an interesting family of related proteins. Data from this report as well as from Houston et al. [14] demonstrate a substantial degree of homology in the N-termini of these proteins. With respect to their N-terminal sequences, pokeweed antiviral protein and pokeweed antiviral seed protein are more closely related to each other than to pokeweed antiviral protein II. The homologous amino acids of pokeweed antiviral protein and pokeweed antiviral seed protein are in-phase with respect to their amino termini, whereas the homologous amino acids within pokeweed antiviral protein II are out of phase by three residues. The greater degree of homology between pokeweed antiviral protein and pokeweed antiviral seed protein as compared to pokeweed antiviral protein II is consistent with immunological crossreactivity between pokeweed antiviral protein and pokeweed antiviral seed protein, but not pokeweed antiviral protein II [11]. An unexpected finding in the present report was the detection of two distinct pokeweed antiviral protein components following reverse-phase chromatography. The components, pokeweed antiviral protein a and pokeweed antiviral protein b, comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, shared identical amino acids in their N-termini (31 residues), and had similar specific activities in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte translation inhibition assay. The basis of the heterogeneity of pokeweed antiviral protein has not been determined. Since pokeweed antiviral protein contains no detectable carbohydrate, it is unlikely that the heterogeneity was due to differential glycosylation. A number of groups have tested pokeweed antiviral protein as a component of immunotoxins. Masuho et al. [13] constructed an antibody-pokeweed antiviral protein immunotoxin that was ef-

fective in killing a murine leukemia cell line in vitro (inhibitory dose 50% of approx. 10 nM). Using antibodies to T-cell antigens and the transferrin receptor, Ramakrishnan and Houston [23,24] have constructed antibody-pokeweed antiviral protein conjugates with potent cytotoxicities in vitro (inhibitory dose 50% approx. 0.1 nM). Allison et al. [25] have used a pokeweed antiviral proteinbased immunotoxin to prolong survival of lymphoma-bearing mice. Since the use of pokeweed antiviral protein II as a component of immunotoxins has not been reported, we focused our attention on this protein. A disulfide-linked conjugate between a monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor and pokeweed antiviral protein II was a potent and specific immunotoxin resulting in a inhibitory dose 50% of 0.7 nM for MCF-7 cells. The corresponding ricin A chain conjugate was more potent, with an inhibitory dose 50% of 0.1 nM. A comparative study by Ramakrishnan and Houston [23] using ricin A chain and pokeweed antiviral protein conjugated to antibodies directed at mouse thyl.1 antigens showed that the ricin A chain-based conjugate was about twice as toxic as the corresponding pokeweed antiviral protein conjugate. Our finding that the antibody-ricin A chain conjugate was more cytotoxic than the corresponding pokeweed antiviral protein II immunotoxin may be related to the ability of ricin A chain to insert into membranes [28]. This event may expedite its entry into the cytoplasm of cells, where it would express its translation inhibitory properties. Trowbridge et al. [26] have previously shown that an anti-transferrin receptor-ricin A chain conjugate was more toxic than the corresponding diphtheria toxin A fragment conjugate (diphtheria toxin A fragment cannot insert into lipid bilayers [29]). We have also confirmed that result in our system (anti-transferrin receptor-diphtheria toxin A fragment inhibitory dose 50% for MCF-7 cells was 5 nM). A detailed comparison of various translational inhibitors, including pokeweed antiviral protein II, as components of breast tumor selective immunotoxins is in progress in our laboratory. Despite the fact that anti-transferrin receptorpokeweed antiviral protein II was less effective in vitro than the corresponding ricin A chain-based immunotoxin, the therapeutic use of pokeweed

antiviral protein II as a component of immunotoxins may have certain advantages. Pokeweed antiviral protein II, as well as the other pokeweed antiviral protein-translation inhibitors and similar plant proteins, are not associated with a B-chain equivalent in their natural state. This fact decreases nonspecific toxicity effects and allows the use of pokeweed antiviral protein II that is of lower purity than that required for ricin A chain in conjugates. The use of immunotoxins as part of in vivo tumor therapy modalities may be complicated by host immune responses to the component parts of immunotoxins (antibody and effector). The development of human-derived monoclonal antibodies should circumvent, at least in part, the immune response to heterologous antibodies. One way to circumvent the potential immune response to the effector molecule is to have a variety of immunological distinct inhibitors at one's disposal. To date, a number of inhibitors [1] have been utilized as components of immunotoxins including ricin A chain, abrin A chain, diphtheria toxin A fragment and related mutant proteins, gelonin, pokeweed antiviral protein, and various whole toxins. This reports extends the list to another translational inhibitor, pokeweed antiviral protein II, which lacks immunological crossreactivity with all of the above mentioned effectors.
