Ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptors Anke Mueller-Fahrnow* and Ursula Egner
Estrogen receptors are multi-domain proteins that interact with other proteins and DNA to fulfil their function: the regulation of transcription. During the past 2­3 years, our understanding of this complex process has increased tremendously as crystal structures of isolated ligand-binding domains in complex with various ligands, as well as co-activator peptides, are now available. The structural information, combined with new data on novel co-activators/co-repressors, muteins and their actions, and novel ligands, allows for the first time the development of detailed theories for the first steps of transcription initiation.

Although the availability of the structures has contributed to our understanding of ER actions, a number of open questions remain, especially concerning the conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding (described below). In this review, we give an overview of new data on estrogen receptor LBDs with a special emphasis on structural aspects. We try to outline the implications of the structure on our understanding of the protein function and point out areas for future research.

Homology with other nuclear receptors
With respect to sequence homology, the superfamiliy of NRs can be divided into several subfamilies. The ER subfamily comprises ER and ER, which share ~55% sequence identity in their LBDs (two proteins are expected to share a similar fold if the sequence identity is >30%, and if the identity is as high as 50% the three-dimensional structures can be assumed to be very similar), and the estrogen-receptor-related orphan receptors ERR1 and ERR2 [17]. On the mRNA level, different splice variants have been identified for ERs, but the corresponding proteins have not been detected [18­23]. In the June 1999 version of the SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL database [24], around 30 ER LBD sequences from different species were found, omitting those with only partially determined sequences. Based on a multiple sequence alignment, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed (Figure 1). From this presentation, it is obvious that the interspecies homology for the LBDs is much higher than the similarity between the  and  receptor subtypes. It should also be mentioned that for both ER homologues, LBDs from fish and vertebrates can be clearly distinguished with respect to their sequence homologies (Figure 1). The distribution of conserved residues on the surface of the hER LBD is shown in Figure 2a. Highly conserved residues within the ER subfamily are indicated by yellow colouring of the protein, which is shown in the same orientation as in Figure 3. A striking feature of the ER subfamily is that most of the conserved residues within the LBD are located in one area of the protein, close to one assumed co-activator binding site (see below). A similar analysis for the progesterone receptor subfamily is given in Figure 2b. The human proteins belonging to this subgroup (progesterone, glucocorticoid, androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors) share ~50% sequence identity within their LBDs, but conserved residues are more equally distributed (Figure 2b). The relevance of this observation is not clear. We know, however, that LBDs function via conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding and by interactions with other ER domains and with co-activators/co-repressors. It can therefore be speculated that a highly conserved region

Introduction
The estrogen receptor (ER) belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs). It regulates the expression of specific genes and thus plays a crucial role in many processes, such as the control of reproduction and the development of secondary sexual characteristics [1,2]. It has therefore been a target for research within pharmaceutical companies for many years. As a result, thousands of steroidal and nonsteroidal ligands to the ER have been synthesized, which act either as agonists, partial agonists or pure antagonists. NRs are built up by five to six domains serving different functions. Out of these, the ligand-binding domain (LBD; E-domain) is of special interest not only due to its involvement in ligand binding but also in receptor dimerization and in the transactivation process: the carboxy-terminal region of the LBD comprises the transactivation function AF-2 [3·]. Until recently, the structural basis for these functions has only been poorly understood, but during the past few years crystal structures for the human (h)ER LBD [4,5,6··] and hER LBD [7], as well as for a number of other NR LBDs, have been determined [8­15]. With these structures at hand, the differences and similarities between hER LBDs (Egner U et al., unpublished data) and the recently identified hER [7,16] can be analyzed.

on the protein surface is indicative of a conserved site for protein­protein interactions.

The three-dimensional structure
For most steroid receptors, as well as for a number of related nuclear receptors, crystal structures of LBDs have been determined during the past few years; however, not all of them have been published. In addition to the experimentally determined structures, a number of models have been published based on related structures and on a number of additional supporting biological and binding data [25,26·]. An overview of the ER LBD structures and on some relevant models is given in Table 1. The overall structures of the hER and hER LBD­raloxifene complexes are very similar, the root-mean-square deviation between equivalent C atoms (excluding helix H12) is 0.97 Å [7]. All known NR LBD structures consist of 11­12 -helices and one small -sheet. The secondary structure elements

are arranged in a so-called -helical sandwich, a protein fold that has up to now only been observed for NR LBDs. This fold is shown as a cartoon in Figure 3 together with the numbering of some of the helices. Helix H2, which has been observed, for example, in the retinoic X receptor (RXR) LBD structure [8] is absent in the hER LBD. The mainly hydrophobic binding niche, which is described below in more detail, is located in the lower part of the protein with respect to the orientation of the protein shown in Figure 3. A detailed comparison with the structures of other NR LBDs shows that the upper part of the protein (with respect to the orientation shown in Figure 3) is structurally much better conserved than the lower part harbouring the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) (for details see [3·]; Egner U et al., unpublished data). This can be rationalized as the natural ligands differ considerably in size and shape; the structural variability can thus be attributed to the affinity towards diverse ligands.

for the differences between partial agonists and pure antagonists is thus not yet understood.

Conformational changes The ligand-binding pocket
ERs bind the endogenous ligand estradiol with a very high affinity of 0.05 nM for hER and 0.09 nM for hER, respectively [27]. The protein­ligand interactions have been analyzed and described in detail [28­31,32·]. The otherwise hydrophobic LBP, which is not accessible from the protein surface in the agonist-bound state (see below), harbours two polar regions located at opposite ends of the cavity. At the deep end of the pocket, Glu353 and Arg394 (hER numbering) serve as anchoring points for the 3-hydroxy group of estradiol (E2). In addition, a conserved water molecule stabilizes this interaction. This hydrogen bond network explains the predominant contribution of the 3-hydroxy group to the binding affinity of the steroid [25]. Similar hydrogen bonds are observed in all available hER and hER LBD structures. The 17-hydroxy group of E2 interacts with the second polar region within the LBP, that is, with His524 (hER numbering). Different sidechain conformations for this residue are observed in the various complex structures known to date. Except for these two polar regions, the LBP is lined by hydrophobic residues. The fact that some are flexible (e.g. methionine and isoleucine) accounts for the high affinity of a variety of steroidal and non-steroidal ligands, including phytoestrogens such as genistein [7,27]. As the estrogen receptors are of such high medical relevance, thousands of ligands have been synthesized within research institutions and in the pharmaceutical industry. With respect to their functions, the ligands can be classified as agonists (e.g. E2 [32·]) partial agonists (e.g. raloxifene [28]) and as pure antagonists [30,32·]. Up to now, structures are only available for the first two groups, so that the structural basis For the hER LBD, seven crystal structures are available. The most striking difference between these structures is the orientation of helix H12. A comparison with related structures ([4,6··]; Ruff M et al., personal communication) indicates that the position of this helix depends on the presence of a ligand. In the only available apo form of a NR LBD, the RXR LBD, this helix points away from the protein core [8]. In most of the available agonist-bound LBDs, however, the helix is folded back and serves as a lid closing the entrance to the LBP. At the same time, AF-2 is brought into a position where co-activators can bind resulting in transcription initiation. In the case of the hER LBD, helix H12 is anchored in this `agonist conformation' by hydrophobic interactions as well as by hydrogen bonds. The more space-consuming ER partial agonists with their long-chain substituents cannot be accommodated in the LBP in the `agonist conformation' of the protein. It was therefore expected that upon partial agonist binding, helix H12 would be present in another orientation. The two different orientations of helix H12 induced by the agonist E2 and the partial agonist raloxifene are depicted in Figure 3, showing that this is the case. Recently, the crystal structure has been determined for the ternary complex of the hER LBD with the agonist diethylstilbestrol (DES) and a peptide of the co-activator GRIP-1 [6··]. The position of the -helical peptide almost coincides with helix H12 in the antagonist conformation of the protein: upon superposition, the distance between equivalent C positions varies between 0.6­2.2 Å. This observation supports the experimental finding that antagonists block co-activator binding. In contrast to expectation, two structures of the hER LBD in complex with E2 are presently known where helix

H12 is not in the agonist conformation. In the artificial tetramer crystallized by Tannenbaum et al. [5], this helix interacts with a neighboring LBD molecule, and in the recently crystallized triple mutant (Ruff M et al., personal communication), the helix is in the `partial agonist conformation'. The meaning of this structural variablity is not yet fully understood but might be caused by the absence of the carboxy-terminal F-domain (adjacent to helix H12) of the hER in all crystal structures. There is no experimental evidence that the structural variability observed in the structures is caused by the absence of the F-domain. It can not, however, be excluded that an additional domain has a stability effect on three dimensional structure.

close to position 4 of estradiol. In this area, six homologous replacements are encountered (e.g. IleLeu, Met or Val). Another two homologous exchanges are present in the environment of the steroidal D-ring. In spite of the high degree of conservation between the LBPs, an ER subtype-specific ligand exhibiting a more than 100-fold difference in binding affinity has recently been published [31].

Dimerization and binding of co-activators/ co-repressors
Receptor dimerization is a prerequisite for transcription initiation in ER-regulated processes. As LBDs contribute to the dimerization interface, it was expected that the hER­E2 complex would crystallize as a dimer, as is the case. There is evidence that the interactions observed in the crystals reflect the natural dimerization contacts: firstly, all published point mutants influencing ER dimerization are in, or at least close to, a region involved in crystal contact; and secondly, dimers have been observed in crystal structures of related LBDs ([4,6··]; Ruff M et al., personal communication). The topology of the dimer interfaces is comparable in all these structures, especially concerning the key role of helix H10 in the intermolecular contacts. In the case of the hER­E2 complex, the monomer­monomer interactions are very strong: 27 amino acid residues contribute to the large contact surface and out of these 14 are involved in hydrogen bonds. In recent years, several novel classes of transcriptional mediators (co-activators and co-repressors) that interact

Differences between receptor subtypes
The tissue distribution of hER and hER was investigated shortly after the discovery of the second isoform [16]. hER is the predominant subtype in bone, blood vessels and in the brain, whereas its content in uterus and liver is only low. Because of the different distribution in the various target organs, the medical interest in subtype-specific ligands is high. Both human receptors share ~55% identical amino acid residues in their LBDs. The analysis of the LBPs shows that most residues in direct contact with E2 in the hER LBD are conserved in hER. The same is true for residues in the second shell around the ligand. There are a number of differences, however, in the vicinity of the steroidal A-ring

with LBDs have been identified and characterized [33­35,36·,37­39]. It should be mentioned here that some of these mediators, such as NSD1 and GRIP-1, are ligand dependent [33,36·], whereas for others, such as SRC-1, a hormone-independent mechanism is discussed [39]. The recently elucidated structure of hER LBD in complex with a GRIP-1 peptide has already been mentioned above [6··]; however, a comparable complex structure with a hormone-independent mediator is not yet available.

been published. Positions of mutated residues are indicated in the sequence alignment shown in Figure 4. For a number of these mutants, the influence on ligand binding has been analyzed in detail (e.g. [43], and references in [26·]). For the vast majority of them the influence on the binding activity could be understood on the basis of the hER LBD structure. In the more recent literature, the effect of muteins on the transcription potency and on the interaction with coactivators/co-repressors is also described (e.g. [44,46]).

Mutations
In contrast to, for example, the androgen receptor, only one germline mutation is known for the hER, which led to osteoporosis in a young man [40]. A number of splice variants have been identified on the mRNA level and their biological role remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, some point mutations have been identified in patients with primary breast cancer [41]. For a better understanding of the functional role of different residues, a number of engineered mutants of the hER LBD have been investigated ([26·] and references therein, [41­48]), but only four mutants for hER LBD have yet

Conclusions
During the past few years, the progress in our understanding of the hER LBD actions has been tremendous. Several scientific areas have contributed to this achievement. Firstly, after more than one decade of intensive work, crystal structures of hER and hER LBD complexes, as well as of related NR LBDs, are now available. Secondly, novel classes of co-activators and co-repressors have been identified and characterized, which have been mentioned only briefly in this review. Thirdly, new steroidal and non-steroidal ligands to the hERs have been synthesized. A special emphasis has been on the search for pure antagonists, which are considered to have an

improved clinical profile as compared to the commonly used partial agonists, such as tamoxifen. Finally, the effect of engineered mutants has been studied in detail and supported our understanding of the role of single residues within the protein subunit. In spite of the progress outlined above, many open questions and uncertaincies remain concerning the ER LBD actions. To give one example, no crystal structure is available for a complex with a pure antagonist, that is, the structural basis for the functional differences between partial agonists and pure antagonists is unknown. Furthermore, the role of helix H12 and its different orientations has in part been deducted from crystal structures in which the domain adjacent to helix H12, the F-domain, is missing. The conformational variability of this helix might thus be an artefact depending upon the choice of the protein fragment used for the crystallization trials. If the number of new ER LBD structures further increases at its current rate and if the information about the co-activators and co-repressors continues to contribute equally fast to our understanding of ER actions, we will soon be able to form a realistic picture on the early stages of transcriptional activation.

This study provides detailed information on comparative structure-activity relationships of steroidal and non-steroidal estrogen receptor ligands. Factors influencing the relative binding affinity, for example, the steric and polar character of substituents are highlighted. The quality of the derived relationships is critically analysed. 33.

J Biol Chem 1998, 273:6679-6688. The authors analyze the interaction of the co-activator GRIP1 with the estrogen receptor. They suggest that GRIP1 may not only interact with the transactivation function 2 (AF-2) of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) but also contacts the receptor in yet unidentified areas of the LBD. The results are supported by mutagenesis experiments of selected amino acid residues in helix H12 of the LBD. 37.
