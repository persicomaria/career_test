ABSTRACT Microbial degradation of phenylacetic acid proceeds via the hybrid pathway that includes formation of a coenzyme A thioester, ring hydroxylation, non-oxygenolytic ring opening, and b-oxidation-like reactions. A phenylacetic acid degradation protein PaaG is a member of the crotonase superfamily, and is a candidate non-oxygenolytic ring-opening enzyme. The crystal structure of PaaG from Thermus thermophilus HB8 was determined at a resolu° tion of 1.85 A. PaaG consists of three identical subunits related by local three-fold symmetry. The monomer is comprised of a spiral and a helical domain with a fold characteristic of the crotonase superfamily. A putative active site residue, Asp136, is situated in an active site cavity and surrounded by several hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. The active site cavity is sufficiently large to accommodate a ring substrate. Two conformations are observed for helix H2 located adjacent to the active site. Helix H2 is kinked at Asn81 in two subunits, whereas it is kinked at Leu77 in the other subunit, and the side chain of Tyr80 is closer to Asp136. This indicates that catalytic reaction of PaaG may proceed with large conformational changes at the active site. Asp136 is the only conserved polar residue in the active site. It is located at the same position as those of 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase and peroxisomal D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, indicating that PaaG may undergo isomerization or a ring-opening reaction via a D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomeraselike mechanism.

INTRODUCTION Aromatic compounds are widely distributed in nature and serve as an important carbon source for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Aerobic metabolism of aromatics proceeds via molecular-oxygen-dependent hydroxylation catalyzed by either a mono- or di-oxygenase with subsequent ring opening catalyzed by a dioxygenase.1 On the other hand, anaerobic metabolism of aromatics such as benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate proceeds via thioesterification with coenzyme A (CoA), ATP-dependent reduction (dearomatization), and hydrolytic ring opening.2 Recent studies have revealed that aerobic metabolism of benzoate, phenylacetate, and anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) follow novel pathways (the so-called hybrid pathway) that represent combined features of aerobic and anaerobic pathways (i.e., reaction intermediates are in the form of CoA thioesters, and the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation is followed by the non-oxygenolytic ring-opening).3­6 The

metabolism of phenylacetic acid in Escherichia coli W,3 Pseudomonoas sp.,4,7,8 and Azoarcus evansii9 has been well-studied. In E. coli, 14 genes (structural genes paaABCDEFGHIJKZ and regulatory genes paaXY), clustered in

the genome, are involved in phenylacetic acid metabolism [Figure 1(A)]. The first step of the pathway is activation of phenylacetic acid by CoA, which is catalyzed by phenylacetyl-CoA ligase (PaaK).3,4,13,14 The CoA thioester

product is subsequently hydroxylated at C1 and C6 catalyzed by a multicomponent (di)oxygenase/reductase PaaABCDE, generating a non-aromatic dihydroxylated product. The product is then subjected to non-oxygenolytic ring opening, and is further metabolized via a b-oxidation-like reaction pathway.3,4 It was revealed through in silico analyses that homologs of paa genes prevail in a large number of bacteria, suggesting that this novel pathway is common for bacterial phenylacetic acid degradation.9,15 It is not clear which gene product is responsible for the non-oxygenolytic ring opening. Analyses of accumulated metabolites using paaZ- and paaG-deficient mutants of E. coli K-12 demonstrated that both mutants accumulated a 2-hydroxyphenylacetate, a dead end product of phenylacetate catabolism.10 Therefore, it was proposed that the product of PaaABCDE is further metabolized by PaaG and PaaZ, which may catalyze D3,D2-isomerization and/or hydration, non-oxygenolytic ring opening, and dehydrogenation.10 Either PaaG or PaaZ is the ring opening enzyme. The organization of paa gene clusters varies among bacterial strains.10 Furthermore, in some bacteria, not all paa genes are necessarily clustered (i.e., some paa genes are lacking or are located at a site remote from a cluster).9,15­17 Genome analysis of Thermus thermophilus18,19 revealed a paa gene cluster that includes paaABCD, paaZ, paaK, and paaI. In addition, paaF, paaG, paaH, paaJ, paaX, and paaY homologs are located at distinct remote sites from the paaABCDZKI cluster.14 The sequence of PaaG indicates that it is a member of the low-similarity crotonase superfamily.20,21 This superfamily includes enzymes with divergent functions such as hydration (e.g., mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH)22), isomerization (e.g., mitochondrial23,24 and peroxisomal25,26 D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomerases (mECI and pECI), and D3,5,D2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (DCI)27), dehalogenation (e.g., 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehaologenase (4CBD)28), hydrolysis (e.g., 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase29), C-C bond cleavage including decarboxylation (e.g., methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase30) and ring fission (e.g., 2-ketocyclohexylcarboxyl-CoA hydrolase (BadI),31 and 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA lyase/hydratase (BoxC)32), and C-C bond formation including ring closure (e.g., 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoyl-CoA synthase (MenB)33). Furthermore, some members can catalyze more than one of these reactions (e.g., carboxymethylproline synthase (CarB),34 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-lyase (HCHL)35). Although their sequence homologies are low, their tertiary structures are strikingly similar.20 Furthermore, the positions of the catalytic residues are not conserved in the primary and tertiary structures. The only common feature of these enzymes that act on acyl-CoAs is that the enzymatic reaction proceeds via an enolate anion intermediate derived from the acyl-CoA substrate. In addition, the intermediate is stabilized by an oxyanion hole formed at a conserved site.

PaaG from T. thermophilus HB8 contains 254 amino acids (with a molecular mass of 27.5 kDa), sharing 30­ 50% identity with other PaaG homologs. Herein we report the crystal structure of PaaG from T. thermophilus HB8, which reveals that a single catalytic residue is involved in this enzyme class. The active site cavity has the capacity to accommodate a ring compound, and two conformations are observed in different subunits in the asymmetric unit, indicating that conformational changes occur during the catalytic reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expression and purification of PaaG

The gene TTHA0290 coding for PaaG was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using T. thermophilus HB8 genomic DNA as the template. The PCR product was ligated with pT7blue (Novagen). The plasmid was digested with NdeI and BglII and the fragment was inserted into the expression vector pET-11a (Novagen) linearized with NdeI and BamHI. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown at 378C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 lg/mL ampicillin, and then were harvested and sonicated in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl. The crude extruct was heated at 708C for 10 min. After heat treatment, the cell debris and denatured proteins were removed by ultracentrifugation (200,000g, 60 min). The supernatant was purified by four steps of column chromatography, using Resource ISO (GE Healthcare), Resource Q (GE Healthcare), Hydroxyapatite CHT10 (GE Healthcare), and HiLoad 16/60 superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) columns. The purified protein was concentrated to 16.00 mg/mL in solutions of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 150 mM NaCl. The homogeneity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. A selenomethionine-substituted protein of PaaG was expressed in E. coli strain B834 (DE3) plysS, which was grown in M9 medium containing 50 mg/L D,L-selenomethionine. The mutant protein was purified by procedures similar to those for the native protein as described above, with five steps of column chromatography, using HiPrep 26/10 Desalting (GE Healthcare), Super Q Toyopeal 650M (Tosoh), Resource Q (GE Healthcare), Hydroxyapatite CHT10 (GE Healthcare), and HiLoad 16/60 superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) columns. The purified protein was concentrated to 19.74 mg/mL.
Crystallization and structure determination

Crystallization of the native and selenomethioninesubstituted proteins was performed at 208C by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. Reservoir solutions containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyPROTEINS

lether (PEG MME) 2000, 0.05M KH2PO4, 5% (w/v) nondetergent sulfobetain (NDSB) 201, and 20% (v/v) glycerol were mixed with protein solutions in a 1:1 ratio, and equilibrated against the reservoir solution. Crystals appeared within 10 days. Crystals of an osmium derivative were prepared by soaking native crystals in a solution containing 10 mM K2OsO4, 0.1M MES (pH 5.5), 20% (w/v) PEG MME2000, 5% (w/v) NDSB201, and 20% (v/v) glycerol, for 1 h. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the BL44B2 beamline36 at SPring-8, Harima, Japan, equipped with a QUANTUM CCD detector. Each crystal was flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream before data collection. The diffraction data were processed using the HKL200037 program package. Difference-Patterson maps were calculated using the FFT program in XTALVIEW.38 Phase calculation and automatic model building were performed using the SOLVE/RESOLVE39,40 programs. The sites of Se atoms were identified by phasing the SeMet data with SAD phases calculated from the osmium data, and refined using the SHARP41 program. An initial model was constructed, refined, and manually rebuilt using CNS42 and XFIT of XTALVIEW.38 The stereochemistry of the final model was confirmed using the PROCHECK43 program.

The crystal structure of PaaG from Thermus thermo° philus HB8 was determined at 1.85 A resolution by the SIRAS method using selenomethionine-substituted protein. The crystallographic and free R factors converged to 17.2 and 20.3%, respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Six polypeptide chains (chains A-F) are involved in the asymmetric unit. Three polypeptide chains form a homotrimer molecule that is a functional unit, as shown by gel filtration experiments (data not shown). Six polypeptide chains consist of all of the amino acid residues of the protein (254 residues), except for residues Phe66F-Gly67F, which are not included in the model of chain F. These residues are located in a flexible loop (see below) for which electron densities are poor in the six polypeptides. The structure of the monomer of PaaG is shown in Figure 1(B), representing a fold characteristic of the crotonase superfamily. It can be divided into the N-terminal spiral and C-terminal helical domains. The spiral domain consists of seven a-helices (H1­H7) and nine b-strands (A0­A5 and B3­B5) forming two b-sheets. Helix H2 is kinked at Leu77 in chains A and F, and at Asn81 in other chains, representing different conformations (see below). The helical domain consists of three a-helices (H8­H10). Helices H9 and H10 fold back to interact with helix H8 of the same subunit and helix H4 of the adjacent subunit, as observed for 4CBD and ECH.

The superposition of six peptides in the asymmetric unit reveals that they adopt essentially identical conformations in most regions [Fig. 1(C)]. However, conformational differences are observed in two regions, each with residues 63­73 and 76­81, which are situated near the active site formed by Asp136. The region with residues Leu63-Tyr73 has relatively high B-factor values and is defined with poor electron densities, indicating that this region is labile. In contrast, the region with residues His76-Asn81 is clearly defined by electron densities. In this region, chains A and F adopt conformations similar to each other, whereas chains B­E adopt conformations similar to one another but different from those of chains A and F. It should be noted that unassigned electron densities are observed at the putative substrate-binding site of chain A, indicating that an unidentified ligand is bound [Figure 1(E)]. Similarly, for chain F, elongated and less clearly shaped electron densities are observed at the substratebinding site. The observation of the two conformations may indicate that the enzyme undergoes conformational

change during its catalytic reaction. Several water molecules are bound around the active site in six chains. Four more water molecules are bound near the active sites of chains B-E, which are displaced by Tyr80 in the structures of chains A and F, due to the conformational difference. It is worth noting that the volumes of the cavity around the active site in chains B­E are larger than those observed in chains A and F, which may imply the function of PaaG. Three subunits are associated to form a compact molecule with a disk-like shape, related by a local three-fold symmetry [Figure 1(D)]. Helices H8 and H9 undergo extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with helices H2, H4, and H5 of the adjacent subunit. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two trimer molecules of PaaG, stacked in an off-center, head-to-head manner with two molecular three-fold axes out of parallel.

This results in non-symmetrical, inter-molecular interactions. Many water molecules occupy most of the trimertrimer interface, and direct trimer-trimer interactions are observed only in limited regions (Glu218B­Leu226B and Thr217D­Val225D). At the direct contact regions, van der Waals contacts and hydrophobic interactions are dominant, whereas residues Asp72D-Ala75A and Arg78F make hydrogen bonding interactions (and van der Waals contacts) with Ser215E and Glu218C, respectively.

4CBD from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-328 (PDB ID 1NZY, Z 5 33.2, 29% sequence identity); rat mitochondrial ECH22 (PDB ID 1DUB, Z 5 31.9, 34% sequence identity); rat DCI27 (PDB ID 1DCI, Z 5 30.7, 29% sequence identity); and, HCHL35 (PDB ID 2VSU, Z 5 30.5, 27% sequence identity). It is of interest that the conformation of the C-terminal loop after helix H10 in PaaG is similar to that in ECH, but different from that in 4CBD. On the other hand, the conformation of the helical domain of PaaG is entirely different from those of mECI23 (PDB ID 1SG4) and pECI25 (PDB ID 1HNU), though the structures of the spiral domain of PaaG and these ECIs are similar.
Active site and implications for function

Attempts to prepare crystals of PaaG complexed with a putative inhibitor, acetoacetyl-CoA, have been unsuccessful. However, the location of the active site of PaaG can be deduced from those of other crotonase superfamily enzymes. Figure 2(A) shows superpositions of residues of PaaG, 4CBD, ECH, DCI, and pECI facing active site cavities. It should be noted that positions of catalytic residues for these enzymes are not conserved. However, Asp136 of PaaG is located on the same site as the catalytic residues of 4CBD (Asp145), DCI (Asp204), and pECI (Glu258). The putative active site is located in a cavity shaped with the N-terminal end of helix H3, the loop between strand A2 and helix H2, and the loop between strand B4 and helix H4 [Fig. 2(B)]. The cavity is further shaped with helices H9' and H10' from the adjacent subunit (hereafter, `prime' indicates that a residue or a helix/strand is from an adjacent subunit). Residues facing the cavity include Gln61, Phe66, Tyr73, His76, Leu77, Tyr80, Ala105, Phe128, Asp136, and Gln227'. Asp136 is the only polar residue that is conserved in PaaG homologs (see Supporting Information Fig. 1), and it is tentatively identified as a catalytic residue. Asp136 is hydrogen bonded to Ser137 and Gln227'. Hydrophobic residues Tyr73, Leu77, Tyr80, Ala105, and Phe128 provide a hydrophobic environment for the binding site of the acyl moiety of CoA thioester substrate, which may contribute

to accommodation of a hydrophobic group. Ala105 and Phe128 are highly conserved, and Gln61, Leu77, and Tyr80 are generally conserved, in PaaG homologs (Supporting Information Fig. 1). On the other hand, Phe66 and Tyr73 are not conserved. The region from 66 to 74, including Phe66 and Tyr73, varies in polypeptide length among homologs, indicating that this region is not crucial for catalysis. The function of PaaG has not been clearly elucidated. Analyses of metabolic intermediates demonstrated that PaaG- and PaaZ-negative mutants of E. coli accumulated 2-hydroxyphenylacetate, and that PaaG-negative mutant also showed a minor accumulation of 1,2-dihydroxy-1,2dihydrophenylacetyl lactone.10 Thus, it was proposed that PaaG and PaaZ may be involved in the third and the fourth steps of the pathway, respectively. Consequently, PaaG may act on a postulated product of PaaABCD(E) of 2-(1,6-dihydroxycyclohex-2,4-dienyl)acetyl-CoA. This is consistent with the observation that the active site cavity of PaaG has sufficient volume to accommodate a ring compound such as the product of PaaABCD(E). It is also worth noting that electron densities representing an unidentified ring-structured compound were observed in the active site cavity of PaaG [Figure 1(E)]. If PaaG acts on the non-aromatic dihydroxylated product, which reaction does it catalyze with the single catalytic residue Asp136? PaaG is a member of the low similarity crotonase superfamily.20 This family represents a broad range of functions: hydration, isomerization, dehalogenation, hydrolysis, C-C bond cleavage including decarboxylation and ring fission, and C-C bond formation including ring closure.21,33 The only common feature of the catalytic mechanisms is that they form an enolate intermediate during catalysis.20 Positions of catalytic residues of these enzymes in their sequences show variety. Sequence alignment of PaaG shows that the position of the catalytic residue of PaaG is the same as those of 4CBD, DCI, pECI, and 2-cyclohexenylcarbonyl-CoA isomerase ChcB45 (see Figure 3). Furthermore, pECI (and perhaps ChcB) has a single catalytic residue, as is the case for PaaG. Thus, PaaG probably undergoes a D3,D2-isomerization-like reaction.

Crystal Structure of PaaG

Unfortunately, very few crystal structures of members of the crotonase superfamily that catalyze C-C bond cleavage have been solved. Recently, a crystal structure of HCHL has been reported,35 and a catalytic mechanism in which a single catalytic residue Glu143 may undergo C-C bond cleavage has been proposed. In this mechanism, two tyrosine residues are involved in the reaction, activating the substrate by depriving a proton from the 4-hydroxyl group of the substrate. Thus, it appears that C-C bond cleavage may require residue(s) that activates a substrate or a reaction intermediate, other than a conserved single catalytic residue. Because it appears that there is no candidate residue to activate the substrate around the active site, a novel ringopening reaction via the D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomerase-like mechanism of PaaG, in which Asp136 also is involved in the activation of the reaction intermediate, is proposed as follows. Asp136 abstracts a proton from the C2 atom of the acetyl moiety of the substrate (2-(1,6-dihydroxycyclohex-2,4-dienyl)acetyl-CoA), leading to the formation of enolate. This enolate is stabilized by the amide groups of Gln61 and Ala105 as an oxyanion hole. The subsequent rearrangement of electrons results in the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3 of the acetyl moiety, cleavage of the C1­C6 bond of the ring, transformation of a double bond from C4-C5 to C3-C4 of the ring, and protonation of C2 of the ring by Asp136, and thus ring opening is achieved. Two hydroxy groups of the resultant intermediate may be spontaneously converted to keto and aldehyde groups, respectively. If PaaG undergoes this ring-opening reaction, it is likely that the aldehyde product of PaaG is further converted to carboxylate by PaaZ, since the sequence of the N-terminal domain of PaaZ is similar to aldehyde dehydrogenase. The resultant product may have a double bond at C5-C6. The C-terminal domain is similar to MaoC-like proteins. The MaoC-like protein family includes R-hydratase,46 which catalyzes the hydration of 2-enoyl-CoA to form R-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA.47 It appears that subsequent metabolism may be responsible for the postulated R-hydratase activity of the C-terminal domain of PaaZ, if the C-terminal domain has a catalytic function, but it is not certain that the carboxylate product with a double bond at C5-C6 can be hydrated at C5 by this domain. Further functional studies of the C-terminal domain of PaaZ, and of course for PaaG, are inevitably needed for further investigation of the ring opening step in phenylacetic acid degradation.
