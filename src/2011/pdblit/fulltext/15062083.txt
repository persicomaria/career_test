The Helically Extended SH3 Domain of the T Cell Adaptor Protein ADAP is a Novel Lipid Interaction Domain

Protein Engineering Group ¨ Forschungsinstitut fur Molekulare Pharmakologie and ¨ Freie Universitat Berlin ¨ Robert-Rossle-Str. 10, 13125 Berlin, Germany Adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP) is critically involved in downstream signalling events triggered by the activation of the T cell receptor. Cytokine production, proliferation and integrin clustering of T cells are dependent on ADAP function, but the molecular basis for these processes is poorly understood. We now show the hSH3 domain of ADAP to be a lipid-interaction module that binds to acidic lipids, including phosphatidylinositides. Positively charged surface patches of the domain preferentially bind to polyvalent acidic lipids such as PIP2 or PIP3 over the monovalent PS phospholipid and this interaction is dependent on the N-terminal helix of the hSH3 domain fold. Basic amino acid side-chains from the SH3 scaffold also contribute to lipid binding. In the context of T cell signalling, our findings suggest that ADAP, upon recruitment to the cell­cell junction as part of a multiprotein complex, directly interacts with phosphoinositide-enriched regions of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the ADAP lipid interaction defines the helically extended SH3 scaffold as a novel member of membrane interaction domains.

Keywords: ADAP; lipid binding; SH3 domain; PIP2; plasma membrane

Receptor stimulation leads to the rapid assembly of protein complexes at the inner side of the cell plasma membrane as one of the initial events in eukaryotic signal transduction. The individual molecules assemble by means of adapter domains that provide docking sites for exposed peptide sequences, post-translationally modified proteins or lipid membranes.1,2 In general, a certain class of adapter domains is anticipated to bind to a set of target sites that are chemically related and comply with a recognition code defined by the fold and

amino acid composition of the respective domain. SH3 domains are a paradigmatic example of a protein interaction module that is present in a vast number of proteins,3,4 enabling them to be built into multi-protein complexes that contain SH3 domain recognition sequences. These recognition motifs were initially defined as proline-rich sequences5 and structural studies subsequently revealed two surface pockets of the SH3 domain to accommodate the two proline residues of a P-x-x-P motif of the ligand.6,7 However, over the last years the identification of an increasing number of peptide sequences recognized by SH3 domains, but devoid of the P-x-x-P motif, emphasized the versatility of the SH3 scaffold in mediating protein­protein interactions.8­17 In T cells, SH3 domains play an important role in the formation of various signalling complexes that are associated with the activation of small G proteins, the modulation of adhesion, an increase in Ca2C-flux and with cytoskeletal rearrangements.18 The ADAP protein was identified as one of the proteins that becomes strongly tyrosine phosphorylated upon T cell receptor engagement.19­21 Most importantly,

tyrosine residues that attract the SH2 domains of SLP-76 and Fyn kinase. 20,21,28 Recently, the C-terminal fragment of the T cell adapter protein ADAP was identified as a new variant of the SH3 domain. The three-dimensional structure of this SH3 domain revealed an N-terminal a-helix to extensively contact the conserved scaffold, thereby creating a composite surface with a novel surface topology, and was named hSH3.29 The hSH3 domain can no longer bind to proline-rich

1027 (PA) and polyphosphoinositides. This is in stark contrast to the inability of the hSH3 domain to bind to zwitterionic lipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The N-terminal helix (E7­K18) is crucial for this interaction, as a construct devoid of the helixcontaining N terminus (residues K1­G21 of hSH3) does not display any lipid-binding properties (Figure 1(c), right panel). Binding of the hSH3 domain to membranes containing acidic lipids was further investigated by a multilamellar vesicle (MLV) binding assay. While liposomes composed solely of zwitterionic PC did not sediment hSH3, vesicles composed of a mixture of PC and acidic lipids (PS and phosphoinositides) sediment a substantial fraction of the protein. Increasing the mol% of PS within PC/PS vesicles enhances the binding of hSH3 significantly as evidenced by larger amounts of protein within the pellet (Figure 2(a)). Incorporation of 3 mol% phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2, referred to here as PIP2), PI(4)P, or PI(3,4,5)P3 into a PC/PS lipid mixture (while keeping the surface charge of the vesicles constant with that of PC/PS), further increased the amount of vesicle-bound hSH3 domain (Figure 2(b)). Consequently, the incorporation of PIP2 from 1 mol% to 4 mol% into PC/PS vesicles (80:20) corresponds to an increased amount of sedimented protein (Figure 2(c)). Since a lipid composition of 70 mol% PC and 30 mol% anionic lipid is thought to approximately reflect the abundance of lipids in the inner leaflet of the eukaryotic plasma membrane,30,31 and because local PIP2-concentrations initially increase above 1% in stimulated mammalian cells,32­35 the PIP2dependent binding of hSH3 domains of ADAP to

sequences29 and is characterized by clusters of positively charged surface residues (see Figure 1(b)). Based on the knowledge of these structural features we investigated the possibility that ADAP-hSH3 interacts with non-protein binding partners. The presence of a basic cluster comprising the a-helix and several residues within the SH3 scaffold guided our search for negatively charged moieties that are able to interact with the hSH3 domain of ADAP. We discovered that the hSH3 domain binds to phospholipid membranes and has a preference for polyvalent phosphoinositides.

Results
Lipid binding and specificity of the hSH3 domain of ADAP Based on the structural characteristics of the ADAP hSH3 domain (Figure 1(a) and (b)), we investigated the potential of the domain to bind to lipid molecules in a lipid overlay assay. Figure 1(c) (left panel) reveals that the hSH3 domains of ADAP can bind to several acidic lipids: phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic acid

Figure 2. ADAP-hSH3 binds to MLVs containing acidic lipids. As described in Materials and Methods, liposome pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were analysed by SDS-PAGE. (a) Increasing the mol% of PS (as indicated) enhances the binding of the hSH3 domain (cleaved from GST) to PC/PS MLVs (0.4 mM). (b) hSH3 binds more strongly to vesicles containing phosphoinositides. Liposomes (0.3 mM) were composed of 70 mol% PC and 3 mol% PI(4,5)P2, or PI(4)P, or PI(3,4,5)P3 and PS where mol% PS was chosen to keep the surface charge equal to the charge of 70:30 PC/PS vesicles. (c) Incorporation of 1­4 mol% PIP2 enhances the binding of hSH3 to MLVs. Liposomes (0.5 mM) are composed of 80 mol% PC, 1­4 mol% PIP2 and 8­20 mol% PS such that the total negative charge is equalised with that of vesicles comprising PC/PS (80:20 mol%) only. All lipid concentrations refer to the total lipid.

Figure 3. hSH3 binding to phospholipids was monitored by FRET with excitation at 280 nm. Fluorescence emission profiles of hSH3 incubated with 0.5 mM (total lipid) PC/PS/PIP2/NBD-PE SUVs (68:24:2:2 mol%) at 2 mM (filled squares), 4 mM (triangles) and 8 mM (open circles) hSH3 are shown. Filled circles indicate the profile obtained from lipid vesicles only.

1028 PC/PS (70:30) liposomes is likely to be of biological significance. Analysis of lipid binding by fluorescence To independently confirm the lipid interaction of ADAP-hSH3 using further membrane model systems, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays using small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) containing 2 mol% of the fluorescently labelled lipid NBD-PE. The NBD fluorescence group is located at the phosphate head group of the lipid and binding of protein should result in energy transfer between spatially close ° (!50 A) aromatic side-chains of the ADAP hSH3 domain (donor) and NBD (acceptor). The energy transfer leads to an increase of the emission signal of NBD (emission maximum at 534 nm). Such an increase can indeed be observed if ADAP hSH3 is added to PC/PS/PIP2 vesicles. Figure 3 shows the change in signal upon addition of the hSH3 domain, which is indicative of binding. Signal enhancement of 22­33% (at 534 nm) was observed upon addition of 4­8 mM protein, thus confirming a direct inter-

action of the hSH3 domain of ADAP with lipid membranes. Protein alone does not yield an emission signal in the measured region and no FRET could be observed from protein to SUVs consisting of PC/NBD-PE (data not shown) in agreement with no binding to PC MLVs. We then set out to determine the affinity constants of hSH3 binding to PC/PS and PC/PS/PIP2 vesicles using an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence-binding assay (Figure 4(b), Table 1). The values we obtained substantiated the findings observed in the MLV binding assay. An apparent Kd of 158(G12) mM for hSH3 binding to PC/PS/PIP2 (70:24:2) vesicles could be determined which increased to O250 mM to vesicles without PIP2 (PC/PS, 70:30). The PC/PS/PIP2 vesicle composition was chosen in order to equalise the total negative charge with that of vesicles comprising only PC/PS. Increasing the mol% PS enhances the binding significantly; hSH3 bound to 1:1 PC/PS with an apparent Kd of 72(C6.5) mM and a further threefold increase in binding was observed when 2 mol% PIP2 was incorporated into PC/PS (1:1) vesicles (Table 1). The hSH3 domain is monomeric in solution As lipid binding measurements were made with the assumption that hSH3 is a soluble monomeric domain, it was necessary to determine the macromolecular assembly state of the purified domain. The presence of dimers or aggregates can significantly change the interpretation of the lipid binding experiments (e.g. K d measurements) and the behaviour of lipid binding, particularly as certain methods result in co-sedimentation of protein when lipid binding has occurred. Therefore, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed for nine samples of hSH3 (three loading concentrations at different ionic strengths) at four rotor speeds in order to understand the quaternary structure of hSH3. These experiments showed that the protein is predominantly monomeric with a slight tendency to dimerize or oligomerize with decreasing ionic strength (ca 5% of dimers at the highest observable concentration for 50 mM NaCl; Table 2). Figure 5 shows that the fitted curves and random residuals for hSH3 in 150 mM NaCl are in accordance with an ideal single species model. However, the best-fit monomer molecular mass (M) was originally 0.5­1 kDa higher than the predicted value (10.6 kDa). The most likely explanation for the experimentally derived different value of M is a

slight discrepancy of the calculated (0.7286 ml/g)  and true value for the partial specific volume ðnÞ.  The prediction of n is not exact in cases where the molecule is highly charged (m/z!5000), as is the case for hSH3 (hSH3 is predicted to carry a net  charge of 3.4). A value for n was determined from the experimentally derived buoyant molecular mass, treating the molecular mass of hSH3 as a known parameter, as evidenced by MALDI MS performed post-centrifugation. A slightly reduced  value for n was obtained (0.7083 ml/g), as would be expected for a charged protein. In contrast, the assumption of a stable dimer would require  an unrealistic value for the n of the protein (0.8465 ml/g). Table 2 shows the molecular mass

of the hSH3 domain at different salt concentrations  using the corrected value for n and clearly demonstrates that the protein domain is largely monomeric at all three conditions. Confidence in having selected the correct fitting model is indicated by the insignificant changes in variance when a monomer­ dimer association is considered. Inclusion of higher-order polymers did not improve the individual variances. This analysis confirms that hSH3 is a soluble, monomeric domain under the conditions used for lipid binding experiments. Key structural elements for lipid binding In order to dissect the contribution of structural elements within the hSH3 domain fold to membrane binding, hSH3 mutants were analysed. Most importantly, a deletion mutant of ADAP hSH3 that is devoid of the N-terminal helix (DhSH3) did not bind to lipids in the lipid overlay (Figure 1) or FRET assays (data not shown), indicating the absolute requirement of the amphipathic helix for lipid interaction. While the helix certainly stabilizes the hSH3 domain fold by the numerous helix­sheet contacts seen in the NMR structure,29 the solventexposed basic cluster containing an arginine and several lysine residues within the helix (highlighted in Figure 1(b)) probably contributes directly to lipid binding by electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged lipid head groups. To investigate whether individual residues within the SH3 domain scaffold had an effect on lipid binding, we analysed the K63A and K39E variants of hSH3 in the MLV binding assay. Neither of these mutations abolished binding completely; however, a significant decrease in binding was observed for the hSH3 mutant K39E (Figure 6(a); compare with binding of the wild-type hSH3 domain, see Figure 4(a)). Charge reversion at this position of the RT-loop (T32­P49, see Figure 1(a)) results in a greater than threefold decrease in liposome binding (Table 1) and suggests a substantial contribution of the positively charged and solvent-exposed amino acid residues of the RT-loop to hSH3 binding by negatively charged membrane surfaces. To exclude large structural changes upon introduction of the mutation at position 39 as a reason for reduced binding, the mutant was investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The 15N­1H correlation spectra of the K39E mutant (Figure 6(b)) overlaps closely with the wild-type protein spectrum. As can be seen from Figure 6(b), the NH

The ADAP hSH3 Domain Binds to Lipid Membranes

Discussion
Lipid binding by the hSH3 domain sheds new light on the role of ADAP in the context of immune cell signalling. Since ADAP is recruited into a protein complex that is located close to the plasma membrane, it is likely that lipid binding of ADAP itself contributes to the stability, orientation and lateral organization of such a complex. The preference of ADAP for polyphosphoinositides is conceivably coupled to the changes in lipid composition upon cellular stimulation. It is known that PIP3 is up-regulated upon stimulation of T cells,36,37 while PIP2 concentrations are transiently increased on nascent phagosomal membranes,38 two processes where ADAP recruitment to membranes has been documented.24,25 Several proteins crucially involved in integrin activation or cytoskeletal changes upon cell stimulation, as for example vinculin, talin or N-WASP are regulated synergistically by phosphatidylinositols. 39­41 Analogously, membrane binding by the ADAPhSH3 domain might stimulate the interaction of ADAP with a known or a yet to be identified binding partner. This binding partner could be a transmembrane receptor or membrane-bound protein and the necessity of membrane-association for the interaction could be the reason why such a protein was not detected by yeast two-hybrid analysis or pull-down experiments so far. Alternatively, lipid binding could alter the interaction with the known ADAP-interacting proteins as for example SKAP-55, SLP-76 or Fyn. The latter two proteins contain SH2 domains that recognize phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the region N-terminal to the hSH3 domain of ADAP. Fyn itself might well be the kinase that phosphorylates ADAP, since Fyn-knockout mice display reduced levels of ADAP phosphorylation.42 Several interesting questions arise: could lipid binding by ADAP facilitate its initial phosphorylation by Fyn and, by subsequent Fyn-SH2-binding, ease the formation of a more stable membrane-proximal complex that allows other Fyn-targets to be phosphorylated? PIP2-induced enhancement of N-WASP-phosphorylation by Fyn has been demonstrated in the context of neurite extension and it was speculated that binding of PIP2 to the basic region of N-WASP enhances the accessibility of a critical tyrosine residue.43 It will be important to address the question of a possible interdependence of tyrosine phosphorylation and lipid binding of ADAP in the context of the full-length protein and within the cellular environment. While our data clearly show lipid binding capacity of the domain, certain cellular conditions may be required to expose the lipid binding properties of the hSH3 domain within the full-length protein. In addition, the introduction of negatively charged phosphate groups in the vicinity of potential membrane-interacting basic clusters may regulate a protein­membrane interaction, as exemplified by the phosphorylation of serine residues in the lysine-rich region of

Figure 6. Structural details of lipid binding. (a) Liposome assay for the mutant K39E indicating diminished binding to PC/PS (50:50 mol%) vesicles; the concentration of MLVs (total lipid) is indicated. (b) hSH3 (K39E) is a folded domain. Overlap of the 15N­1H correlation spectra of wild-type hSH3 (blue) and the K39E mutant (red) indicating an almost identical fold. Significant shifts are observed for the neighbouring residues of K39, W40 and K38 (indicated) and linebroadening is observed for the resonance signals of T42 and T58 not marked.

resonances of the residues in the vicinity of position 39, K38 and W40, display significant chemical shift differences between the wild-type and K39E mutant protein, while most other resonances remain unchanged. This clearly shows that the overall structure of the mutant is not altered and allows the different lipid binding properties to be attributed to the charge reversion at position 39. Similarly, the lysine to alanine mutation at residue 63 led to a reduction in binding (more than twofold, data not shown). In the great majority of SH3 domains, residue 63 is tryptophan, which contributes to direct binding of the proline-rich ligand.6,7 It lies at the centre of the canonical binding site and the presence of a positive charge at this position in ADAP-hSH3 allows the formation of a more extensive contiguous surface patch with electropositive surface potential (Figure 1(b)). The geometric arrangement of the positively charged side-chains in the context of a structurally defined domain is therefore strongly suggested to be important for lipid binding. We conclude that positively charged amino acid side-chains of the N-terminal helix, the RT-loop (K39) and the conserved scaffold (K63) contribute to lipid binding.

The ADAP hSH3 Domain Binds to Lipid Membranes

1031 involved in polyphosphoinositide binding (see Figures 1 and 6; Table 1) and we therefore suggest that geometric constraints defined by the hSH3 domain fold contribute to lipid binding. While electrostatic interactions probably constitute the major driving force for the hSH3­membrane interaction, non-polar interactions of aromatic/ hydrophobic residues might contribute to the membrane binding of the hSH3 domain, as has been seen for other membrane interacting domains.47 The likely candidate residues for hydrophobic interactions include F13 and F17 (located within the helix), Y19 and I23 (from the linker region), W40 and V47 (within the RT-loop) or I56, Y75 (located within the scaffold at the helix­sheet interface)29 and site-directed mutagenesis shall reveal a possible contribution of these residues to lipid binding. For the helix-linker residues F13, F17, Y19 and I23 to interact with the membrane, a detachment of the helix from the helix-sheet interface would be necessary and the intramolecular contacts would be substituted by the protein­lipid interface. NMR binding experiments of 15N hSH3 with the second messenger product of PIP2 hydrolysis, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) were performed to investigate whether electrostatic head-group recognition is sufficient for the interaction to occur. At a one- to twofold excess of IP3 molecules over protein (0.3 mM), no shift perturbations in the HSQC could be observed, suggesting that no interaction takes place under these conditions (20 mM Mes (pH 5.3), 150 mM NaCl). Additionally, experiments were undertaken with lipid micelles (w9 nm in diameter) containing an equimolar ratio of PC and PS with C8 and C6 acyl chains, respectively. Again, no interaction could be observed (10 mM Mops (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl) at a large molar excess of lipid over hSH3, suggesting that a membrane surface is necessary for electrostatic interaction with several acidic lipid head groups and hydrophobic interactions with the lipid bilayer. The lack of binding is most likely due to the high curvature of the micelle surface as compared to the more planar membrane surface of vesicles, SUVs or MLVs, and thereby hinders accessibility of hSH3 to a threshold number of head groups. The lipid binding affinity observed for the hSH3 domain (Kd of w160 mM to PC/PS/PIP2 (70:24:2%) vesicles) places it amongst the lowaffinity modules, which probably constitute the major class of lipid binding domains2 and includes the majority of PH domains.47 These domains are mostly incapable of driving membrane localization on their own, but are often part of membraneproximal multi-protein complexes that are anchored at the membrane via lipid modifications and additive protein­lipid interactions. Alternatively, once ADAP is localised at the membrane, lipid binding of the hSH3 domain could result in changes in the tertiary orientation of ADAP and associated proteins. In the case of ADAP binding partners, membrane association has been reported

MARCKS.44 However, in ADAP, the characterized phosphorylation sites are more than 50 amino acid residues upstream of the basic cluster and structural investigations of larger fragments of ADAP will reveal whether these regions become close enough in space to mutually influence their binding properties. Modular domains that interact with biological membranes play a key role in orchestrating the assembly, localisation and function of cellular signalling complexes. Lipid recognition domains such as PH, FYVE, PX, PHD, C2, FERM and ENTH achieve selective membrane targeting through a combination of specific (via hydrogen bonding) and non-specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The protein domain best characterized for phosphoinositide binding is the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Pleckstrin homology domains are found in a variety of signalling proteins and contain around 120 residues in a canonical core fold consisting of a seven-stranded partly open b-barrel, capped at one end by a C-terminal helix.45 One property characteristic of PH domains that bind phosphoinositides, is a strongly dipolar electrostatic potential with a prominent positive lobe which contributes to the binding site of a single polyphosphoinositide head group. Outside the core regions are three hypervariable loops (with respect to composition, length, and structure) which flank the head group binding surface of the domain and play a critical role in determining the diverse affinity and specificity.33 While many PH domains are assumed to bind weakly and non-specifically to phosphoinositides, a subset of PH domains displays a high degree of specificity. For example, the PLC-d PH domain binds with high affinity and selectivity to PIP2, involving a network of hydrogen bonds but does not bind to PI(3,4)P2.46 An alternative lipid recognition mode is exemplified by the PKC substrate, MARCKS44 and its interaction with negatively charged lipids. The recognition of phosphoinositides is mediated by the highly basic effector domain of MARCKS, which is unstructured in aqueous solution. Binding of this conserved 25-residue stretch to lipids is mediated by nonspecific electrostatic interactions as the MARCKS effector domain binds with similar affinity to the equally charged lipids PIP2 and PI(3,4)P2.44 The hSH3 domain of ADAP is to our knowledge the first example of the SH3 scaffold to be utilized in lipid binding. It exhibits a highly basic surface that binds to a variety of acidic lipids. The observed preference for PI(4)P, PIP2, and PIP3 as compared to PS might lead to a co-sequestration of ADAP in regions of the plasma membrane where phosphoinositide concentrations are locally increased and suggests that hSH3 does not just simply recognise a negatively charged surface. The presence of a cleft running between the helix, RT loop (containing K39), the n-Src loop (T59­T62) and the neighbouring residue K63 could feasibly accommodate a PIP2 or PIP3 head group. The use of hSH3 mutants in this study indicate that the region containing this cleft is

1032 for the Fyn tyrosine kinase due to lipid modification of its C terminus.48,49 The ADAP interacting protein SKAP-55 contains a PH domain that might well act in synergy with ADAP in membrane recruitment. Recent findings also suggest that a single domain can mediate both lipid binding and protein interactions. For example, PX domains have been identified as bona fide protein interaction domains in yeast,50 and our findings suggest that lipid binding can be achieved on the basis of the SH3 domain fold. Whether lipid binding is a more general feature of SH3 domains or whether it represents a relatively new evolutionary invention remains to be investigated. The most characteristic feature of the hSH3 domain is the N-terminal extension of the fold by an amphipathic helix with positively charged residues at the solvent-exposed positions. Furthermore, the RT-loop of the domain comprises an excess of positively over negatively charged amino acid residues, while the reverse is true for most "canonical" SH3 domains. It is tempting to speculate that other unusual SH3 domains exist that interact with lipids, and that protein­protein interactions mediated by SH3 domains are complemented by lipid binding in yet to be discovered eukaryotic signalling complexes.

PI(3,4,5)P3 were also obtained from Avanti. Inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (IP3) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein­lipid overlay assay Overlay assays were carried out using GST fusion constructs of the ADAP hSH3 domains. PIP strips (Echelon Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) containing phospholipids spotted onto Hybond-C membranes, were blocked in 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) in TBS-T for one hour at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 8C with 10 mg/ml of the indicated proteins. The membrane was washed three times over 30 minutes with gentle agitation followed by two hours incubation with an anti-GST antibody (1:1000 (v/v) dilution, SantaCruz). The washing regime was repeated and the membrane was incubated for two hours with a 1:10,000 (v/v) dilution of anti-rabbit IgG-HRP prior to detection of bound proteins using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce Illinois). Multilamellar vesicle binding assays To prepare multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), lipids in chloroform or chloroform/methanol/water solutions, were mixed at the desired ratios and dried on a rotary evaporator in a 50 ml round-bottom flask. The lipid films were then resuspended in liposome buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Mops (pH 7.2)) and MLVs were separated from smaller vesicles by centrifugation for ten minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4 8C and resuspended in the original volume of fresh buffer. For the binding assay, 2 mM protein was added to serial dilutions of MLVs in a total volume of 150 ml and incubated at room temperature for 15­30 minutes. Subsequently, free and lipid-bound proteins were separated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for ten minutes at 4 8C. The supernatant was immediately removed and aliquots of supernatant and pellet samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE. FRET Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by tip sonication of PC/PS/PIP2/NDB-PE MLVs (68:24:2:2 mol%) on ice in a nitrogen atmosphere. The suspension was centrifuged for ten minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4 8C, to remove remaining MLVs and titanium traces from the tip sonicator and then resuspended in the original volume of fresh buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Mops (pH 7.2)). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays were then performed on a LS 50B spectrofluorometer (Perkin­Elmer Corp., Germany) utilising the intrinsic tryptophan (donor) fluorescence of hSH3. Excitation at 280 nm (3 nm slit width) gives rise to an emission peak at w350 nm which overlaps with the minor excitation peak of NBD-PE (acceptor). As a measure of binding, the emission of NBD-PE (534 nm, 5 nm slit width) was observed upon excitation of tryptophan (280 nm). All measurements were carried out in a 10 mm quartz cuvette (Hellma) at 22 8C at a scan speed of 250 nm/minute. Fluorescence binding measurements We determined the molar partition coefficient, Kpart, for the binding of hSH3 to PC/PS/PIP2 MLVs using an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence assay where free (unbound protein) was monitored from the tryptophan

Materials and Methods
Production of the recombinant ADAP-hSH3 domain The N-terminal GST-tagged protein used in this study comprises residues 683­771 of the full-length ADAP protein and was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS from the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia) at 37 8C. The fusion protein was purified by glutathione (GSH) affinity chromatography using a GSTrap column (Pharmacia) and then cleaved from GST overnight at 8 8C with bovine thrombin (Merck Biosciences; 50 units/25 mg of fusion protein). The hSH3 domain was further purified by gel-filtration using Sephadex-75 agarose (Pharmacia) and the molecular mass was verified by mass spectrometry (measured massZ10,596.7 Da, calculated massZ10603.0 Da). Mutants were prepared using overlap PCR and were overexpressed and purified in the same manner as the wild-type protein. While the lipid overlay assay was performed with the GST fusion construct of hSH3 and DhSH3, all other experiments were carried out with the GST-cleaved hSH3 or mutant domains. Lipids The synthetic lipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), which contain palmitic and oleic acid esterified at the 1 and 2 positions of the sn-glycerol backbone, 1,2Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD-PE), and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-Dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-L-serine] (used for NMR experiments) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The phosphatidylinositol phosphates PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P2 and

Two-dimensional NMR-spectroscopy To ascertain that the introduction of the single point mutations in the hSH3 domain does not perturb the overall fold of the hSH3 domain, HSQC spectra were obtained for 15N labelled samples of wild-type protein and the mutant proteins and overlaid. Measurements were performed at 25 8C using the Bruker DRX600 instrument. Data processing and analysis were carried out with the XWINNMR (Bruker), and the Sparky software package www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky.

fluorescence emission at 350 nm (3 nm slit width) using an excitation of 280 nm (5 nm slit width). As described above for the MLV binding assay, 1 mM protein was added to serial dilutions of MLVs in a total volume of 500 ml and incubated at room temperature for 15­30 minutes. Subsequently, free and lipid-bound proteins were separated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for ten minutes at 4 8C. The supernatant was immediately removed and the amount of free protein in each sample determined by fluorescence intensity at 350 nm. These values were corrected for fluorescence arising from the buffer and the percentage of bound protein at a given lipid concentration was calculated from the fluorescence of a protein sample (without lipid) i.e. 100% free protein. The binding of the hSH3 domain to phospholipid vesicles is expressed as a molar partition coefficient, Kpart (MK1),51 which is the proportionality factor between the mole ratio of protein bound to the outer monolayer of the vesicle, [protein]bound/[lipid], and the concentration of protein in the bulk aqueous phase, [protein]. Thus, [protein]boundZ Kpart[protein][lipid]; [lipid] is the concentration of lipid present in the outer monolayer of the MLVs. All total lipid concentrations were divided by 6 to take into account the inaccessibility of all but the outer leaflet to the protein because of the sealed nature of the multilamellar vesicles. Under the experimental conditions used, [protein]bound/[lipid] then: % protein bound Z Kpart ½lipidð100Þ=ð1 C Kpart ½lipidÞ (1)

Equation (1), which makes no assumption about the mechanism of binding, was fitted to the data to yield Kpart. If one assumes that the protein forms a 1:1 complex with a lipid (L) we can describe an apparent dissociation constant, Kd (1/Kpart) that indicates the concentration of accessible lipid that binds half of the protein.

Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation equilibrium (SE) experiments were performed in a Beckmann Coulter analytical ultracentrifuge at 4 8C. Samples of hSH3 (cut from GST) were in dialysis equilibrium with a buffer containing 50 mM NaiPO4, (pH 7.4) and 50, 150 or 250 mM NaCl, as indicated. Three different loading concentrations (1, 0.5 and 0.1 mg/ml) were brought to apparent sedimentation and chemical equilibrium, as judged by WinMATCH, at 20,000, 27,000, 33,000 and 38,000 rpm. Radial concentration profiles were recorded with absorption optics at wavelengths ranging from 230 nm to 300 nm with a radial increment of 0.001 cm and ten-point averaging. Concentration gradients were globally fitted to various models with UltraScan6.0 (B. Demeler, University of Texas, Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Datum points with an absorption O1.2 were excluded from the fitting process. Robustness of the fitted parameters was ascertained by Monte-Carlo simulations, including at least 2500 simulations.  Theoretical values for the density of the buffers, n, pI, charge and extinction coefficient of the protein were calculated from composition with SEDNTERP.52 Integrity of hSH3 was routinely tested by mass spectrometry before and after the experiments.  www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu
