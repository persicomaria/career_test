Metallo-b-lactamases (mbls) confer broad-spectrum resistance to b-lactam antibiotics upon host bacteria and escape the action of existing b-lactamase inhibitors. SPM-1 is a recently discovered mbl that is distinguished from related enzymes by possession of a substantial central insertion and by sequence variation at positions that maintain active site structure. Biochemical data show SPM-1 to contain two Zn2C sites of differing affinities, a phenomenon that is well documented amongst mbls but for which a structural explanation has proved elusive. Here, we report the ° crystal structure of SPM-1 to 1.9 A resolution. The structure reveals SPM-1 to lack a mobile loop implicated in substrate binding by related mbls and to accommodate the central insertion in an extended helical interdomain region. Deleting this had marginal effect upon binding and hydrolysis of a range of b-lactams. These data suggest that the interactions of SPM-1 with substrates differ from those employed by other mbls. SPM-1 as crystallised contains a single Zn2C. Both the active site hydrogen-bonding network and main-chain geometry at Asp120, a key component of the binding site for the second zinc ion, differ significantly from previous mbl structures. We propose that variable interactions made by the Asp120 carbonyl group modulate affinity for a second Zn2C equivalent in mbls of the B1 subfamily. We further predict that SPM-1 possesses the capacity to evolve variants of enhanced catalytic activity by point mutations altering geometry and hydrogen bonding in the vicinity of the second Zn2C site.

Introduction
The clinical impact of opportunist Gram-negative bacterial pathogens continues to increase with the growing number of severely immunocompromised or immunosupressed individuals, such as transplant, HIV, cancer chemotherapy and other intensive care patients.1 By comparison with their Grampositive counterparts, the treatment options for hospital-acquired infection of surgical wounds and devices by species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii are

already severely limited by the intrinsic resistance of such organisms to many front-line antibiotics. This situation is exacerbated by the readiness with which these bacteria may acquire additional resistance genes by transferring mobile elements such as plasmids and integrons both within and across species boundaries.2,3 Few of the new generation of antimicrobials now approaching clinical use show promise in the treatment of infections by such organisms.4 The b-lactams remain among the antibiotics of choice to counteract such infections. Their widespread use has generated intense selective pressure, resulting in the emergence of resistance mechanisms, of which the most important in Gramnegative species is the production of b-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6), hydrolytic enzymes able to inactive b-lactams by cleaving the amide bond of the

891 BcII and VIM-2 enzymes have been determined with the Zn1 site alone or both sites occupied (PDB accession nos 1KO2 and 1KO3),13,26 catalytically competent mononuclear forms of some other family members have been generated,27 and it has been proposed that, under physiological conditions, all mbls function as monozinc enzymes.28 Nevertheless, the majority of available structures indicate a dinuclear metal centre and the structural basis for the apparent variation in zinc affinity within the B1 subfamily remains obscure. Whilst chromosome-borne enzymes from an increasing number of both pathogenic 29 and environmental30 organisms continue to be discovered, it is apparent that the most immediate clinical threat is posed by the enzymes that have been effectively mobilised. Four such have been identified: the IMP and VIM classes that contain multiple sub-types, and have been identified across a range of species and geographic locations; GIM-1, a recently discovered enzyme from a P. aeruginosa isolate of German origin, and SPM-1.8 SPM-1 was purified from a highly resistant P. aeruginosa isolate from a paediatric leukaemia patient admitted to a Brazilian hospital and was confirmed to be a new mbl31 in a novel genetic context where it is associated directly with common region (CR) elements rather than integrons and/or transposons.32 A subsequent screening programme confirmed the presence of SPM-1-producing strains in a high proportion (35%) of carbapenem-resistant isolates from seven geographically widespread Brazilian centres.33 It is thus among the mbls of most immediate clinical relevance. The blaSPM-1 sequence31 revealed an open reading frame encoding a 276 amino acid residue polypeptide, the first 30 residues of which were shown to be removed post-translationally.34 The sequence confirms SPM1 to be a class B1 mbl most closely related (33% identity between the mature, processed, proteins) to the IMP-1 enzyme, with sequence conservation particularly strong in the C-terminal half of the protein, but to be distinguished from the other B1 mbls by virtue of a central insertion of 24 amino acid residues and substitutions at two highly conserved positions, Asp84 and Arg121. In addition, although all of the zinc ligands are conserved, atomic absorption measurements revealed a protein to zinc stoichiometry of 1:1.5 and the kinetics of inhibition by chelators were distinctly biphasic, suggesting that SPM-1 may possess two metal sites of very different affinities.34 Nevertheless, steady-state kinetics reveal SPM-1 to hydrolyse efficiently a wide range of b-lactam substrates from all main classes, with kcat/KM values that compare favourably with those obtained for other B1 enzymes.34 Given these differences, and the high level of clinical significance of SPM-1, we have embarked upon a detailed structural and biochemical characterisation of the purified enzyme. Knowledge of the structure and mechanism of enzymes such as SPM1 will facilitate identification of common structural

four-membered b-lactam ring. Since the discovery of the first b-lactamase in Bacillus spp. in 1940,5 more than 400 such enzymes have been characterised. The majority of these are active site serine enzymes that hydrolyse b-lactams via a covalent acylenzyme intermediate and are largely ineffective against the carbapenems (the newest and most powerful generation of b-lactam agents).6 Many, though not all, serine-b-lactamases are effectively countered by mechanism-based inhibitors such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam.7 However, a second unrelated group of zinc metalloenzymes is now emerging as a source of resistance to almost all types of b-lactams, including carbapenems, in a range of opportunist Gramnegative pathogens. The clinical threat posed by the broad spectrum of activity and insusceptibility to serine-b-lactamase inhibitors of these metallo-blactamases (mbls) is exacerbated by their increasingly rapid dissemination on mobile genetic elements through the microbial community.8 The first mbl to be identified was the chromosomal BcII enzyme from Bacillus cereus.9 Subsequently, more than 20 mbls have been characterised from a range of bacterial species. Whilst all belong in class B of the Ambler sequencebased,10 or group 3 of the Bush-Jacoby-Medeiros11 functional classification schemes, significant variation amongst these enzymes necessitates their further subdivision into three sub-classes (B1, B2 and B3).12 Although available crystal structures (see PDB accession nos 1KO2 and 1KO3)13­19 reveal that the overall fold, an ab/ba sandwich with the active site situated in an open cleft between the two domains, is well conserved, the relatively low level of overall sequence identity between mbls results in significant structural and mechanistic differences between them. In the B1 and B3 subclasses, two zinc ions occupy one tetrahedral tri-histidine site (Zn1) and one trigonal bipyramidal histidine, aspartate, and cysteine (B1) or histidine (B3) site (Zn2) with co-ordination completed by m-bridging and terminal Zn2-bound water ligands. In subclass B2, substitution of Asn for His116 in the Zn1 site generates a protein in which occupancy of the Zn2 site alone is sufficient for maximal activity but that acts against a restricted range of carbapenem substrates. Similarly, whereas subclass B2 enzymes are distinguished by an extended helix a3 that connects the two ab domains and aids binding and orientation of carbapenem substrates,19 the N-terminal domain of B1 mbls incorporates a flexible loop (residues 61­65) that closes over the active site groove when substrates or inhibitors are bound.16,20 Within the B1 subfamily, to which the majority of mbls belong, different enzymes vary widely in their affinity for candidate inhibitors,21,22 in the mechanism employed to hydrolyse b-lactam substrates,23­25 and in their affinity for zinc. This latter point remains controversial: structures of the

We anticipated that the structural consequences of the central insertion and point substitutions evident in the SPM-1 sequence might shed light on two aspects of mbl biochemistry; namely, substrate recognition and metal affinity, that remain poorly understood. Accordingly, we have determined the crystal struc° ture of SPM-1 to 1.9 A resolution, and we have investigated the consequences of deleting the central insertion sequence. The structure reveals that SPM-1 lacks a mobile flap (residues 61­66) that participates in substrate binding in other B1 mbls, whilst deletion mutagenesis shows the central insertion to have only limited structural and catalytic roles. These data suggest that interactions made by SPM-1 with substrates may differ substantially from those in related proteins. As crystallised, SPM-1 contains one zinc ion in the Zn1 site, and exhibits main-chain geometry of the zinc ligand Asp120 that differs markedly from that in all other B1 mbls. We propose that this lowers the Zn2C affinity of the SPM-1 Zn2 site. Comparison with related mbl structures suggests that the strength of interactions made by the Asp120 carbonyl group modulates affinity of this site across the B1 mbl subfamily. These observations further suggest that point mutations at positions such as 84, 121 and 218 may lead to emergence of SPM variants with enhanced Zn2C affinity and catalytic activity.

indicating two molecules in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 52% (v/v). These grew within two to three days at a constant 20 8C. Initial attempts at structure determination by molecular replacement using the IMP-1 structure (33% sequence identity) as a search model were unsuccessful and the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) technique35 was accordingly employed. Rapid data collection and analysis at the Structural Biology Center at APS enabled the data collection strategy to be changed "on-the-fly" using feedback from a first experiment to maximise the usefulness of data collected from a single synchrotron trip.36 Our results suggest that, for metalloprotein structure solution, multiwavelength anomalous (MAD or single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD)) techniques with their associated advantage of de novo phase determination can be faster and simpler than molecular replacement methods, even where quite closely related search models exist. Retrospective data processing further demonstrated that the anomalous signal in the peak data set alone was sufficient for structure determination by SAD. The advent of rapid automated methods of structure solution from anomalous data will most likely make this the method of choice for determination of metalloprotein structures. After automated model building, manual rebuilding, addition of water molecules and refinement, the final structure contains 3902 protein atoms, 358 water, three azide and two ethylene glycol molecules, one chloride and two zinc ions in the asymmetric unit. Refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The two molecules are packed tightly together in a "head-to-head" dimeric configuration (Figure 1) and are related by an almost exact 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis (179.78 rotation and no translation). This unusual mode of packing is, in some respects, reminiscent of

that observed in the dinuclear BcII structure,26 although in this case the primary inter-chain interaction occurs through end-on contacts between a-helices and the active site is less occluded. Association involves contacts between surface hydrophobic patches adjacent to the active site formed by Phe61 and Phe87 and between the extended interdomain region of SPM-1 (residues Glu149, Asp150b, Lys150f and Tyr151) and the N-terminal b-strand (b1) of the opposing subunit (see below). (Note that the BBL standard numbering system12 is used here). Although such an association is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, we employed analytical ultracentrifugation to investigate the association state of SPM-1 in solution. A representative trace of sedimentation equilibrium distribution is shown in Figure 2. Simultaneous non-linear, least-squares fitting, to a single value for Mr, of six data sets comprising three different loading concentrations of SPM-1 at rotor speeds of 15,000 rpm and 20,000 rpm (see Materials and Methods) gave an Mr of 28,443 (27,924­28,967), where the figures in parentheses are the confidence limits (95%) for the fitting routine. From the amino acid sequence of mature SPM-1, the predicted subunit Mr is 27,514. Sedimentation equilibrium thus confirms that SPM-1 is monomeric in solution. No evidence for any subpopulation of dimers or other associated states was obtained at any concentration employed. Similarly, the elution position of SPM-1 from the Superdex 75 gel-filtration column employed in the final stages of purification was consistent with a monomer of approximate mass 28,000 Da.

The main panel shows absorbance at 280 nm as a function of radius of centrifugation, following the centrifugation of SPM-1 (0.4 mg/ml) at 20 8C in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, 10 mM ZnCl2, 0.1 M NaCl for 16 h at 20,000 rpm. The line through the experimental points corresponds to a global fit to M in equation (1) for multiple data sets at various concentrations and speeds (see the text): the best fit was obtained with MZ28,443 Da. The upper panel shows the distribution of the residuals between the data and the fit.

Overall structure Experimental electron density maps permitted tracing of the SPM-1 polypeptide chain from Asp35 (note that the alignment used in the BBL scheme12 is numbered from the start of the signal peptide of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia L1 enzyme) to the C terminus (Leu316). No density was observed either for the N-terminal serine residue generated by proteolytic removal of the 18 amino acid residue signal peptide34 or for the side-chains of nine surface residues that were accordingly truncated at the Cb position. Five residues, Asn184, Glu188 and Arg247 in the A subunit and Tyr-67 in both, were modelled in dual conformations. The two subunits in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical (rmsd ° between Ca atoms 0.20 A). The overall fold of the molecule (Figure 3(a)) closely resembles those of the other five members of the B1 sub-group for which crystal structures are known, and may be described as an ab/ba sandwich with the active site sitting in an open groove formed at the interface of the two b-sheets. Superposition of Ca atoms of the SPM-1 monomer (A chain) upon the B1 mbl structures ° yields rmsd values varying from 1.45 A (IMP-1) to ° 1.60 A (BcII). The main-chain topology most closely resembles that of the Bacteroides fragilis CcrA and B. cereus BcII enzymes by virtue of possession of a short N-terminal b-strand (residues 35­39; b1) that enlarges the b sheet portion of the N-terminal subdomain from seven to eight strands.

(c) Structure of A. hydrophila CphA (bottom right, PDB accession 1x8g19).

Although the overall structure of SPM-1 thus conforms closely to the B1 mbl subgroup paradigm, two important differences are apparent. Between residues 61 and 65 of the standard sequence numbering scheme,12 the loop separating strands b2 and b3 (of IMP-1- as shown in Figure 3(b), or of VIM-2 or Chryseobacterium meningosepticum BlaB,) or b3 and b4 (of BcII or CcrA) in the N-terminal half of the mbl b sandwich extends into a flexible flap region that is unstructured in the majority of unliganded mbl crystal structures.14,16,26 A significant body of evidence from NMR,20,37,38 molecular dynamics39 and mutagenesis20,24 experiments supports the proposal that this loop promotes hydrolysis of b-lactams by closing over the active site upon association of enzyme with substrates. However, in SPM-1, strands b3 and b4 are separated only by a stretch of five amino acid residues that form a tight turn structure reminiscent of that found in the subclass B2 CphA enzyme from Aeromonas hydrophila19 rather than the extended loop of other B1 family structures. This close proximity to secondary structural elements makes it less likely that, in SPM-1, this truncated loop undergoes the

relatively substantial substrate-induced rearrangements that are proposed to occur in the other class B1 mbls. It has been proposed that positions 61, 67 and 87 of the B1 mbls, usually occupied by bulky hydrophobic amino acid residues, form a hydrophobic pocket that may contribute to substrate binding.18 In SPM-1, these positions are Phe61, Tyr67 and Phe87, and the structure is thus more compatible with this alternative hypothesis. The most immediately striking feature of the SPM-1 structure relates to the central 24 residue sequence insertion. In the B1 metallo-b-lactamases, the two halves of the core b-sandwich are joined by a two-turn a-helix a3 (residues 140­148) followed by an open coil structure (residues 150­178). In SPM-1, the additional amino acid residues are accommodated in this region by an extension of the a3 helix to five turns (residues 138­150) and an elongation of the adjoining coil that includes insertion of an additional two-turn helix a4. This region lacks an equivalent in any known subclass B1 structure, and database searches using the insertion sequence alone failed to identify any other homologue. In view of the structural

895 efficiency kcat/KM of between threefold (ceftazidime) and 32-fold (ampicillin). The sole exception to this trend is in the KM values for the carbapenem substrates that show modest decreases: 3.9-fold over wild-type for imipenem and 4.6-fold for meropenem. These are counterbalanced by somewhat larger reductions in k cat of 52-fold for imipenem and 45-fold for meropenem. By comparison with the results of deletion of the b2-b3 (IMP-1)/b3-b4 (CcrA) loop, these effects are modest. Deletion of residues 61­66 from CcrA40 resulted in a loss of catalytic efficiency kcat/KM of 1600-fold, 4400-fold and 150-fold against penicillin G, cephaloridine and imipenem, respectively, resulting from effects upon both kcat and KM. In IMP-1, the effect of deletion of the same residues24 varies far more dramatically with substrate; from 2.5-fold (imipenem) to 370-fold (penicillin G). Moreover, these data mask increases in kcat for the deletion mutant against several substrates, of up to 100-fold in the case of cefoxitin. We conclude that the contribution of the extended SPM-1 loop to binding and hydrolysis of substrates is generally slight. It is nevertheless tempting to speculate that in the case of carbapenems its removal may increase the conformational flexibility of the protein to facilitate tighter interactions with substrate. These could involve the hydroxyl moiety of the 6bhydroxyethyl substituent that distinguishes the carbapenems from the other substrates studied here, but may be detrimental to the catalytic step(s). Active site The SPM-1 active site is depicted in Figure 4. Inspection of electron density maps from the earliest stages of refinement onwards confirmed the initial observation that, whilst a strong electron density peak was present in a position corresponding to the tri-His or Zn1 site, no metal ion was present in the Cys221-His263-Asp120 (Zn2) site in either molecule of the asymmetric unit. As crystallised, SPM-1 thus contains a single zinc ion coordinated by the three conserved residues His116 ° ° ° (2.16 A), His118 (2.07 A) and His196 (2.03 A), and ° by a single water molecule (Wat333; 1.68 A) in a tetrahedral arrangement (distances given are for molecule A). Wat333 is also bonded to the OD2

similarity between IMP-1 and the remainder of SPM-1 (above), its presence provides the most likely explanation for our lack of success with molecular replacement. Although A. hydrophila CphA (Figure 3(c)) also possesses an elongated a3 helix, this is distinguished from the present structure by a kink about Trp150 that enables a3 to follow the surface curvature of the protein and provide a hydrophobic face that contributes to binding of carbapenem substrates.19 By way of contrast, SPM-1 a3 forms a rigid extended rod whose distal end lies almost ° 30 A from the active site zinc ion. Substantial remodelling of this region would therefore be required for it to contribute to recognition and binding of substrate in a similar fashion. However, residues at the distal end of a3 such as Glu149, Asp150b, Lys150f and Tyr151 are involved in intersubunit contacts in the crystallographic dimer, and it is conceivable that this region may be more conformationally flexible in solution. This idea is supported by the crystallographic B-factors for ° chain A, which average 24.57 A2 for the whole ° molecule but 42.73 A2 for the insertion region (residues 150b­165). For the second molecule in the asymmetric unit (chain B), the overall B-factors ° are higher (34.06 A2), and this distinction is less pronounced. Mutagenesis of the a3-a4 loop Accordingly, we sought to investigate experimentally whether the extended a3-a4 region in the SPM-1 structure might be of functional significance. A deletion mutant, SPM L-Del, from which residues 150b­165 were removed, was generated, expressed and purified. Atomic absorption confirmed the protein:Zn2C stoichiometry to be 1:1.5, equivalent to that of the wild-type enzyme, and circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the overall secondary structure resembled that of wild-type SPM-1 but with a small reduction in the content of a-helix (data not shown). Steady-state kinetic characterisation of the SPM L-Del protein against penicillin, cephalosporin and carbapenem substrates is shown in Table 2. The results reveal that a combination of increases in KM and decreases in kcat leads to an overall reduction in catalytic

° oxygen atom of the conserved Asp120 (2.81 A). ° A fifth water molecule (Wat145) lies 3.01 A distant and is positioned in line with the His116:Zn1 co-ordination bond. Although this does not distort the geometry about Zn1 significantly, it is possible that this may represent the direction of approach of the b-lactam carbonyl oxygen atom, thereby indicating that this metal ion can adopt a five-coordinate geometry on association with substrate. As in other mbl structures,13­18 a network of interactions serves to orient and polarise the Zn1 histidine ligands to ensure optimal metal binding. His118 makes an edge-face interaction with the neighbouring Phe117, a residue common to many of the subgroup B1 enzymes. The NE2 nitrogen of this residue, lying distal to zinc, H-bonds to OD1 of Asp236, a position occupied by a carboxylic acid in all known subclass B1 sequences. NE2 of His196 is H-bonded to a structurally conserved water molecule that is held in position by interactions with the main-chain carbonyl groups of positions 231 and ° 233. His116 ND1 makes a weak H-bond (3.04 A) interaction with OG of Thr115, a residue that is wellconserved across subclass B1 and the wider mbl superfamily.41 His263 ND1 makes a direct contact with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ser68. In the absence of Zn2, oxidised forms of Cys221 were observed in both molecules of the asymmetric unit. Oxidation of this residue has been reported in structures of mono-zinc forms of both the BcII42,43 and VIM-2 (PDB accession no. 1KO2) enzymes. However, we concur with the conclusions reached by Davies et al., 43 who observed mono-zinc structures of BcII in which Cys221 was found in both oxidised and unoxidised forms, that Cys221 oxidation is not responsible for loss of Zn2 and, rather, that it is the loss of Zn2 that renders the protein susceptible. In SPM-1 the low (1.5:1) metal to protein stoichiometry and unusual biphasic kinetics of inhibition by zinc chelators such as EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline,34 contrast with the behaviour observed for the IMP or VIM

enzymes.27,44 Similarly, comparison of the SPM-1 crystallisation conditions (pH 8.0, 100 mM ZnCl2) with those from which crystals were obtained of dinuclear forms of other B1 mbls (CcrA, pH 7.0, 10 mM ZnCl2;14 BcII, pH 5.6, 100 mM Zn(CH3COO)2;42 BcII, pH 4.5, 500 mM ZnSO4;26 IMP-1, pH 5.6 no added Zn2C;16 VIM-2 pH 6.5 no added Zn2C (PDB accession no. 1KO3); BlaB, pH 8.4, 100 mM Zn(CH3COO)218) highlights the fact that most related enzymes can retain a dinuclear metal site at similar or lower concentrations of zinc and at pH values where protonation of free Zn2 ligands such as His263 would be expected to occur. We thus consider that the available evidence points to the Zn2 site in SPM-1 as being of lower affinity than is the case in the other subclass B1 enzymes. A network of interactions maintains active site structure We therefore sought a structural explanation for the apparent reduction in affinity of the SPM-1 Zn2 site, which nevertheless retains a full complement of protein ligands. Figure 5 depicts the active sites of mbls of subclass B1, focussing upon the protein environment in the vicinity of the Zn2 site. Inspection of these structures in the light of available biochemical data suggested that two factors might contribute to the variation in affinity of this site that is evident across the enzyme family. Firstly the two Zn2C sites (each of which includes ligands from both of the two ab domains) are connected by a network of H-bonds that thus also links the N and C-terminal halves of the molecule together. His116 in the Zn1 site is connected (in some cases via an intervening water molecule) through Thr115 and Asp84 to Arg121, which in turn contacts the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Asn70 (adjacent to the His263 second-shell ligand at position 68) and Gly262 (next to His263). Whilst the details of this network vary between the different enzymes (Figure 5) it is present in some

form in all family members of known structure. Thr115, Arg121 and Asp84 are all highly conserved in mbls of subclass B1 and Asp84 is notable in occupying a normally disallowed region of Ramachandran space (fw70­808; jw1508). Secondly, the carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp120, an invariant Zn2 ligand that plays a crucial role in catalysis,45,46 is held in position by contacts with protein groups (IMP-1), ordered water molecules (VIM-2, BcII, BlaB) or a sodium ion (CcrA). In the SPM-1 structure (Figure 5(a)), both of these sets of interactions are disrupted. Although Thr115 is present in SPM-1, the side-chain hydroxyl group

° makes only a weak (3.04 A) H-bond with His116 ND1, in contrast to the water-mediated interactions ° with shorter bond lengths (ca 2.70 A) of the, BcII (Figure 5(b)) BlaB (Figure 5(c)) and VIM-2 (Figure 5(d)) structures. (13,18,26; PDB accession no. 1KO3) Substitution of Ser for Asp84 abolishes the contacts made by the Asp84 carboxylate group with the main and side-chains of Thr115, and leaves the Thr115 and Ser84 side-chain hydroxyl groups ° 3.70 A apart. Whilst the cavity between Ser84 and Thr115 is occupied by an azide ion in the current structure, this is unlikely to be physiologically significant. The space that is created by the absence

898 of a side-chain at position 121 (glycine in SPM-1) is occupied by two crystallographic water molecules (Wat199 and Wat158 (chain A)) that approximate to the positions of the Arg121 NH1 and NH2 nitrogen atoms of other structures. However, the Asp120 Gly121 peptide bond is rotated such that the mainchain carbonyl group of SPM-1 Asp120 now points into the Zn1 site (jw888) rather than into the N-terminal domain (K218!j!118). Consequently, this cannot form the productive hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions that are a feature of other B1 mbl structures. Several lines of evidence support our contention that the hydrogen bonding network, involving residues such as 69, 84, 115, 121 and 218, is important to the structure and activity of B1 mbls. Oelschlaeger and co-workers postulate that the switch from Ser262 to Gly that distinguishes the IMP-6 variant from IMP-1 reduces catalytic efficiency against some substrates by increasing flexibility of the zinc ligand His263 through an indirect or "domino" effect stemming from disruption of the Ser262:Lys69 interaction (Figure 5(e)).47 Furthermore, adding an additional H-bonding group to this network through the IMP-1 Phe218 Tyr mutation produced an enzyme with catalytic efficiency enhanced over that of the wild-type.48 In the VIM enzymes, a Tyr-Phe switch at position 218 is one of the alterations associated with the VIM-7 variant, an enzyme whose catalytic efficiency against most substrates is considerably reduced compared to that of VIM1 and VIM-2.49 Mutation of Asp84 in CcrA reduced catalytic efficiency against nitrocefin by three orders of magnitude,50 whilst random mutagenesis of IMP-1 showed positions 69, 84 and 262 to be essential for expression of the resistance phenotype against some, but not all, b-lactam antibiotics.51 Similarly, a very recent directed evolution study of BcII identified Asn70 Ser and Gly262 Ser as two of a total of four mutations enhancing hydrolysis of cephalosporins with small or methyl pyridinium substituents at the 3 0 position.52 Although these data support our assertion that this network is important to mbl activity, the contribution to metal ion affinity is less clear. Mutant enzymes such as CcrA Asp84 Val or IMP1 Ser262 Ala retain dinuclear Zn2C centres,48,50 although Zn2C affinity constants are not available. Accordingly, we looked for additional structural features that might explain the wide variation in affinity for a second zinc ion that is a feature of the B1 enzymes. In the five previous B1 mbl structures, the carbonyl group of the Zn2 ligand Asp120 contacts a variety of partners but retains a similar orientation (K218!j!118; Figure 5). However, the strength of these contacts varies considerably and, interestingly, appears to correlate with the variation in Zn2C affinity at this site. Structures show BcII to ° possess a weak bond (3.65 A) between the Asp120 carbonyl group and an ordered water molecule,26 and biochemical studies demonstrate that removal

SPM-1 Metallo-b-lactamase Structure

of the second Zn2C from this enzyme is relatively facile.53 By way of contrast, although the Thr115Asp84-Lys121 network of BlaB is identical with that of BcII, the affinity for the second Zn2C is almost three orders of magnitude greater.28 Here, the ° equivalent hydrogen bond length is 2.85 A.18 For the VIM-2 enzyme, where chelator inactivation kinetics44 and the availability of a structure in which Cys221 is oxidised (PDB accession no. 1KO2) suggest a weaker Zn2C site, the same interaction ° occurs with a distance of 3.25 A. Lastly, CcrA, where the Asp120 carbonyl oxygen atom makes a ° tight (2.23 A) contact with bound NaC (Figure 5(f)), appears to be the B1 mbl from which removal of one Zn2C equivalent is most difficult.54 This hypothesis also explains why the CcrA Cys121 Arg mutant possesses a Zn2 site of reduced affinity,54 whilst that of the BcII Arg121 Cys variant is essentially unchanged.55 Introducing arginine to the CcrA framework would be expected to displace NaC, whereas additional ordered water molecules in the BcII Cys mutant can replicate the interactions made by Arg121.43 In the light of these data, we argue that the altered main-chain conformation about Asp120 is the primary contributor to the lowered affinity of the SPM-1 Zn2 site. In this respect, the SPM-1 structure differs from those of all other subclass B1 mbls, including those of mononuclear forms of VIM-2 and BcII (PDB accession no. 1KO2,13,43). It is likely that in SPM-1 the presence of Gly121 permits Asp120 to adopt an alternative conformation, whose j angle prevents any interaction involving the carbonyl oxygen atom. Whilst significant attention has been paid to second shell ligand effects acting at metalloprotein zinc centres,56 we are aware of no study in which disruption of interactions involving the main chain, rather than side-chain, of first shell ligands has been demonstrated to be responsible for modulating metal affinity in this manner. Although we cannot discount the possibility that the reduced and altered active site hydrogenbonding network of SPM-1 may also weaken the Zn2 site, we consider that the evidence from other mbls points rather to a role for this system in optimising the dinuclear metal centre for catalysis, possibly by "fine-tuning" the orientations of the two metal ions relative to one another.

Concluding Remarks
The crystal structure of SPM-1 confirms our earlier conclusions that this is an mbl with several unique properties. Sequence alignment, possession of a full complement of ligands for both the Zn1 and Zn2 sites, and efficient hydrolysis of a wide range of b-lactam antibiotic substrates,34 all place SPM-1 in subclass B1. The structure, however, reveals features such as the short loop between strands b3 and b4 (residues 61­66) and the extended interdomain helix a3, that are more reminiscent

SPM-1 Metallo-b-lactamase Structure

899 variants with altered activities such as those present in the IMP and VIM enzyme families are yet to be reported. The crystal structure, however, suggests that SPM-1 may possess the capacity to evolve more potent activities through point mutation. In particular, addition of a side-chain at position 121 should constrain Asp120 into conformations similar to those observed in other B1 enzymes and more favourable for Zn2 binding. Similarly, we predict that a Ser84Asp variant should enhance activity by restoring the hydrogen bonding network that underlies the dinuclear zinc site, and that this effect might be potentiated further by additional mutations such as Gly121Arg and Phe218Tyr. The prospect of enhanced variants of an already efficient resistance enzyme whose expression leads to clinical antibiotic failure is worrisome. Experiments investigating these hypotheses are currently underway in our laboratory.

of the subclass B2 mononuclear enzymes such as CphA. In some respects, SPM-1 thus represents a structural hybrid between the two subclasses. Of particular interest is the observation that SPM-1 lacks the well-characterised 61­66 loop that is proposed to be important in substrate binding by other B1 enzymes and, unlike CphA, does not utilise the extended a3 helix in a similar role. Whilst these observations may serve to emphasise the primary role of interactions involving Zn2C in binding of substrates by mbls,57 it is possible that the mechanism of b-lactam recognition by this enzyme may differ substantially from that of superficially similar systems. The issue of zinc stoichiometry in mbls, in particular related to the enzymes of subclass B1, is one of continuing debate.28 Within subclass B1 there exists a wide variation in affinity for a second zinc ion, as adjudged by the ease53 or difficulty54 with which mono-zinc derivatives of the various enzymes may be prepared. Our structure supports earlier biochemical evidence suggesting that the Zn2 site of SPM-1 is potentially the weakest that has been identified so far.34 However, despite the considerable body of work on mbls that now exists, no hypothesis has been put forward to explain how affinity at the second Zn2C site varies across the B1 family. A comparison of the SPM-1 structure with those of other B1 mbls now allows us to propose that it is the variability of interactions involving the main-chain carbonyl group of the Zn2 ligand Asp120 that primarily modulates the affinity of the Zn2 site in these enzymes. Although Zn2C dissociation constants for this site have not been reported for all subclass B1 mbls, we consider that available data point to a correlation between Zn2C affinity and the strength of interactions involving the Asp120 carbonyl group Our structure suggests that precise positioning of Asp120 is crucial for optimal binding of Zn2, and emphasises the importance of this residue to the structure and function of the mbl active site.45,46 However, we are reluctant to extrapolate this conclusion to speculate on the occupancy or otherwise of the SPM-1 Zn2 site under physiological conditions. Evidence from several mbl systems supports the concept that zinc affinity may alter considerably in the presence of substrate.28 In this respect, it may be significant that, on hydrolysis of the colorimetric cephalosporin nitrocefin by SPM-1 under single-turnover conditions in the presence of 100 mM Zn2C, we find the blue-shifted intermediate previously observed in other systems to be highly populated (T.A.M. and J.S., unpublished results). This species is thought to be stabilised by the proximity of the unprotonated b-lactam nitrogen atom to Zn2 in the dinuclear metal centre,23 and its existence could therefore be considered to indicate the presence of a metal ion in the Zn2 site under these conditions. Although SPM-1 has already been detected in P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from widely separated Brazilian hospitals,33 and is present in a genetic context that will permit dissemination,32 sequence

Materials and Methods
Crystallisation and data collection SPM-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5a containing clone 24-S of a P. aeruginosa genomic DNA library in vector pK18,58 and purified by ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography as described.31,34 Protein was concentrated to 15 mg/ml by centrifugation and crystallised from 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 2.0 M ammonium sulphate by the hanging-drop, vapourdiffusion method using drops composed of 1 ml of protein solution and 1 ml of reservoir solution over a total reservoir volume of 500 ml. Crystals were mounted in rayon loops (Hampton Research), cryoprotected by transient exposure to mother liquor with the addition of 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and frozen at 100 K either by direct transfer to the cryo-cooled X-ray set or by plunging into liquid nitrogen. A single native data set was collected ° to 1.9 A resolution on beamline 19BM of the Structural Biology Center, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, IL. Preliminary molecular replacement experiments carried out at the beamline were unsuccessful and the MAD approach was accordingly adopted. An X-ray fluorescence scan was used to confirm the presence of zinc and to determine the optimal positions for collection of data sets corresponding to the peak and inflection points of the Zn2CK absorption edge. Data sets at these two positions and at an additional highenergy remote wavelength were collected in the order peak-remote-inflection. These experiments were performed on the adjacent beamline 19ID. In both cases, data were collected on custom-built SBC-2 3!3 mosaic CCD detectors. Data sets were indexed, integrated, scaled and merged using the HKL-2000 suite.59 The statistics are presented in Table 1. Structure solution Two zinc sites per asymmetric unit were readily located by automated Patterson searches as implemented in the program SOLVE,60 using the three 19ID data sets.

building were performed using RESOLVE,61,62 which placed 73% of amino acid residues (44% with side-chains and the remainder as alanine, glycine or proline). Remaining residues (predominantly loops) were built manually using O.63 The model was refined using REFMAC 5,64 with crystallographic water molecules added using ARP/wARP version 5.0,65 as implemented in the CCP4 software suite.66 Anisotropic B-factor and TLS refinement (in which each crystallographic monomer was treated as a single TLS unit) was employed in the final stages. Refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 8C, in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Six-channel centrepieces were loaded with 100 ml samples of SPM-1 (dialysed against 50 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mM ZnCl2, 0.1 M NaCl) with 120 ml of dialysis buffer in the reference chambers. Data were collected for three protein loading concentrations (0.2 mg/ml, 0.4 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml) at rotor speeds of 15,000 rpm and 20,000 rpm. After 16 h and 20 h at each speed, absorbance at 280 nm was recorded as a function of centrifugal radius. The profiles taken after 16 h and 20 h were identical, indicating that sedimentation had reached equilibrium. Centrifugation was extended for a further 5 h at 40,000 rpm and the absorbance recorded at the meniscus was used as a fixed baseline offset in subsequent data analysis. Single and multiple absorption profiles were fitted by non-linear regression analysis using ORIGIN software67 to obtain the best fit for M (molecular mass) in the equation:  Ar Z A0 exp½Mð1KnrÞðr2 Kr2 Þðu2 =2RTÞ C B 0 (1)

The presence and integrity of the SPM-1 L-Del mutation was confirmed by sequencing of both DNA strands. SPM-1 L-Del was expressed and purified from E. coli DH5a periplasmic extracts as described,34 except that ammonium sulphate was added (to 60% saturation) to periplasmic extracts, these were centrifuged (9000g, 1 h, 4 8C) and the supernatant de-salted on a G25 Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences) prior to loading on the ion-exchange column. Improved separation was obtained by using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) for the size-exclusion step. Protein was characterised by mass spectrometry and atomic absorption spectroscopy as described.34 Circular dichroism spectra were measured between 200 nm and 260 nm at 25 8C on a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter in 2 mm path-length cells using 10 mM protein dialysed into 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Steady-state enzyme kinetics were performed as described.34 The BBL standard numbering system is used throughout.12 Protein Data Bank accession code Co-ordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2FHX.
