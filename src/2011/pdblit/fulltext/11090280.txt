Leiden Institut of Chemistry Gorlaeus Laboratories, P.O. Box 9502, NL-2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands DNA three-way junctions (TWJs) containing unpaired residues at the branch point can adopt a conformation in which one helix is stacked upon another, forming a coaxial, quasicontinuous double helix. As in four-way junctions (FWJs), two conformers with different stacking arrangements between the arms are possible. However, in both types of structures a markedly strong preference for one conformer has been observed. To investigate the basis for this preference, in particular the influence of the stacking proclivity of the base-pairs at the centre of the junction, two linear oligomers (36 nucleotides), TWJ1 and TWJ2, differing only in one base-pair (G·C versus C·G, respectively) at the branch point, were designed and chemically synthesized. Each one is expected to fold into a stable three-way junction, containing two unpaired thymidine bases at the junction region and two arms capped with a hairpin loop. The data obtained from 1H and 31 P-NMR spectroscopy confirm that both oligomers are present as stable three-way junctions. In both TWJs two of the helical arms stack preferentially upon each other. However, the stacking arrangement is similar in both molecules. From this it is deduced that purine-purine stacking across the junction cannot be considered as a major factor that determines the preferred stacking arrangement.

Introduction
Nucleic acid three-way junctions (TWJs) are comprised of three double-helical arms that are connected in a branch-point to form a Y-shaped structure. They are in fact the simplest branched nucleic acid structures. TWJs commonly occur as structural motifs in RNA including the 5 S ribosomal RNA (Noller, 1991), sn U4/U6 RNA (Guthrie & Patterson, 1988) and the hammerhead ribozymes (Forster & Symons, 1987; Haselhoff & Gerlach, 1988).

In general, branched structures in RNA are structural elements with a more or less permanent existence, whereas DNA branched structures are formed as intermediates in processes leading to DNA rearrangements. By far the most extensively studied DNA branched structure is the fourway junction (FWJ) or Holliday junction (Holliday, 1964), which has now been accepted as a central intermediate in homologous genetic recombination (Holliday, 1964; Broker & Lehman, 1971; Orr-Weaver et al., 1981) and has been observed as an intermediate during site-specific recombination (Hoess et al., 1987). DNA three-way junctions may arise when recombination occurs without replication (Broker & Doermann, 1975; Minagawa et al., 1983; Jensch & Kemper, 1986). Little is known concerning the exact nature of the interactions that stabilize these branched structures, although it seems probable that the same type of

703 Y-shaped conformation with pseudo-3-fold symmetry (Duckett & Lilley, 1990; Welch et al., 1993). Upon addition of Mg2+ a change in conformation is observed in which the symmetry is lost, but a more or less extended structure without helix-helix stacking remains. This observation can easily be understood by inspection of molecular models in which one tries to accommodate a double helix between two adjacent base-pairs of a double helix that is perpendicular to it. Obviously, such an insertion is not geometrically possible without destroying at least two base-pairs. This explains also the observation made by Leontis et al. (1991), that insertion of unpaired bases in the centre of the junction causes an increase in stability. The TWJ can now fold into a conformation in which coaxial helical stacking occurs. Two different coaxially stacked conformers can be adopted as shown in Figure 1(a). However, in the few cases that the stacking pattern was established, only one conformer was found (Rosen & Patel, 1993a,b; Leontis et al, 1993, 1995; Welch et al., 1993). It is speculated that the base sequence at the branch-point, e.g. the maximization of purine-purine stacking across the junction, plays an important role in determining the stacking partners (Leontis et al., 1993, 1995). Lu et al. (1991) concluded, relying on electrophoretic studies of TWJs lacking unpaired bases at the branch-point, that not only the nature of the bases flanking the branch but also that of the nearest neighbours govern the stacking pattern. In order to investigate the factors that could be involved in determining which one of two possible conformations in TWJs predominates, a series of oligomers was designed in which only one or two base-pairs are varied. Each oligomer contains two unpaired thymine residues at the branch-point and two highly stable H2-type minihairpin loops (Pieters et al., 1990; Ippel et al., 1992: and see Figure 2). The application of these minihairpin loops as stabilizing structural elements (reviewed by Altona & Pikkemaat, 1995) recently resulted in the smallest stable Holliday junction studied so far (Pikkemaat et al., 1994). Here, we report the results of NMR studies of two three-way junctions, TWJ1 and TWJ2, that differ only in one base-pair (G·C) or (C·G) in the centre (Figure 2). Our aim was to verify the hypothesis that purine-purine stacking will determine between which helices the stacking interactions occur. When indeed this hypothesis holds, TWJ1 will be present as conformer II, while TWJ2 should adopt conformer I (Figure 1(a)). It is found that both fragments indeed form stable three-way junctions in which coaxial, quasicontinuous helical stacking between two arms occurs. However, both molecules adopt the same conformation.

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of three hypothetical conformations in (a) three-way junctions and (b) four-way junctions. For both cases, the extended conformation can be considered as the intermediate between two distinct conformers, I and II. The latter consist of one pair of coaxially stacked helical arms for TWJs and of two pairs of coaxially stacked helical arms in FWJs.

interactions that stabilize FWJs also play a role in stabilizing three-way junctions. Rosen & Patel (1993b) pointed out that a TWJ can be considered as a FWJ in which one arm has been removed and the unpaired bases serve to bridge the resulting gap, allowing the molecule to retain the inter-helical stacking arrangement. Electrophoretic and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments have shown that in the absence of magnesium ions, FWJs adopt an extended conformation (reviewed by Lilley & Clegg, 1993a,b) in which the arms are oriented in a square planar or tetrahedral configuration (Duckett et al., 1988, 1990; Clegg et al., 1994). However, in the presence of a sufficient amount of Mg2+, a conformation is adopted in which the arms are pairwise coaxially stacked to form two quasicontinuous helices (Duckett et al., 1988). This has been explained (Lilley & Clegg, 1993a,b; Welch et al., 1993) in terms of electrostatic repulsion between phosphate groups approaching each other in the centre of the junction that favour the formation of the extended conformation. Apparently, magnesium ions reduce the repulsion forces by non-specific binding in the region of the centre. In the presence of these ions, stacking interactions predominate and induce a conformational transition to the stacked conformation. Two different stacked conformers are possible, depending on whether helix A stacks with its neighbour to the left, helix B, or to the right, helix D (Figure 1(b)). However, in all FWJs that have been studied so far a single conformation strongly predominates (80 to 100%). The stacking properties of the bases in the centre of the junction are believed to play a dominant role (Duckett et al., 1988; von Kitzing et al., 1990; Murchie et al., 1989; Guo et al., 1991) in determining which conformer dominates. In the absence of Mg2+, TWJs without unpaired residues at the branch-point (``tight'' or ``perfect'' TWJs) are known to adopt an extended

In contrast to reports in the literature that divalent cations are essential for the folding of bulged three-way junctions (Welch et al., 1993; Leontis et al., 1991), we found that stable TWJs with

a unique stacking arrangement between two arms, were formed at relatively low salt concentration ([Na+ ] = 60 mM) and in the absence of Mg2+. Rosen & Patel (1993a) also observed that at a high concentration of NaCl (200 mM), magnesium ions are not required for the formation of stable TWJs. Therefore, no Mg2+ was added to the sample. One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra in 2H2 O Figure 3 shows the methyl proton region of the one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectrum of TWJ1 and TWJ2 in 2H2 O (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate) at 280 K and 282 K, respectively. The methyl proton resonances and the aromatic resonances (not shown) of both TWJ1 and TWJ2 are relatively sharp in a wide temperature range from 280 K to 325 K, implying that both molecules are stable and present mainly in one conformation. At higher temperatures, a second set of minor peaks becomes evident and several resonances start broadening, indicating that the fragments are starting to melt. In the methyl proton region, the presence of two CTTG minihairpin loops in TWJ1 and TWJ2 can be verified easily (Pieters et al., 1990; Ippel et al., 1992, 1995; Pikkemaat et al., 1994). A single set of nine methyl proton resonances is visible for each molecule (Figure 3). Two thymidine methyl signals are located at unusually low field, ca 2.0 ppm. This is the characteristic value of the first thymine residue in TT-minihairpin loops. Two methyl proton signals are located within the chemical shift region that is common to methyl resonances of thymine residues in a random coil, between 1.6 and 1.8 ppm (Altona, 1990). These signals originate from the unpaired T28 and T29. The other methyl protons

resonate further upfield compared with the random coil: approximately between 1.5 and 1.25 ppm. Methyl resonances of thymidine bases in B-DNAtype double helices as well as those of the second thymidine in the TT-hairpin loop are generally found in this region. The formation of two minihairpin loops, which is confirmed by other NMR experiments (vide infra), indicates that both oligomers have folded into the expected conformation. The stacking properties of the bases are monitored by the methyl proton chemical shifts. By following the chemical shifts of the methyl proton resonances as a function of the temperature, detailed information about the local and global stability of the three-way junction can be obtained. Figure 4 shows the chemical shift versus temperature profiles of the thymine methyl protons of TWJ1 and TWJ2. From these data it is clear that both oligomers exist as stable three-way junctions up to around 325 K. As the temperature is further raised, the methyl proton signals of one of the unpaired thymidine bases (T29) and the signals of those in the stem (T25, T3 and T31) broaden considerably (data not shown) and shift to the region that is characteristic for methyl resonances of thymine residues in a random coil. TWJ1 appears to melt at a slightly higher temperature compared with TWJ2: Tm lies approximately between 332 and 334 K for TWJ1 and between 328 and 330 K for TWJ2. Above 340 K the signals sharpen again, corresponding to a single-stranded conformation.

P-NMR spectra

One-dimensional 31P-NMR spectra provide further evidence for the presence of minihairpin loops. 31 P chemical shifts can be used to extract information about the phosphodiester torsion angles a and z (Gorenstein, 1992; Lerner et al., 1984). Figure 5 shows the 31P-NMR spectra of TWJ1 and TWJ2. Most of the 31P resonances are found in a narrow region between -0.3 and -1.5 ppm, corresponding with the 31P-shifts of phosphate groups with torsion angles z(g- )/a(g- ), which are commonly found in B-DNA-type structures. Two resonances are shifted considerably downfield (by ca 0.5 ppm) and two signals are shifted upfield by ca 1 ppm. This pattern of down- and upfield shifted 31P resonances is typical of H2-type hairpin loops (Pieters et al., 1990; Ippel et al., 1992, 1995; Pikkemaat et al., 1994) and originates from the phosphate group of the first thymine residue in each loop (T12 and T22) and the second thymine residue in each loop (T13 and T23), respectively.

H-NMR spectra in H2 O

Figure 6 displays the imino proton region of the one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra of TWJ1 and

TWJ2 at 270 K in H2 O. For both oligomers, three clearly resolved resonances are observed at relatively low field, roughly between 13.5 and 14.0 ppm. This region is characteristic of the resonances of thymine N3H imino protons in Watson-Crick-type A·T base-pairs. The presence of all three A·T base-pairs, which was confirmed by 2D NOESY experiments in H2 O (data not shown), together with the formation of two minihairpin loops, as was demonstrated above, provide additional evidence that both oligomers are folded into three-way junctions. Further upfield, a set of sharp resonances is visible between 12.7 and 13.3 ppm, arising from imino protons participating in G·C base-pairs. The relative integrals of the high and low field regions correspond to approximately 12 and three protons, respectively, resulting in a total of 15 G·C and A·T base-pairs formed at 270 K. At relatively high field, between 11.7 and 10.5 ppm, another set of signals corresponding to six protons, is observed. These resonances broaden considerably when the temperature is raised and eventually disappear (T > 300 K). This behaviour is typical of imino protons of unpaired thymine residues, in which the protons are more accessible to solvent molecules and therefore in relatively fast exchange with the solvent. The signals belong to the four thymidine bases in the two minihairpin loops (T12,

Although the 31P-NMR spectra have not been assigned, the appearance of two pairs of phosphorus signals at ca 0.1 ppm and ca -2.3 ppm (labelled L2 and L3 in (a) respectively) is highly indicative of the presence of two H2-type hairpin loops. The two pairs of signals originate from residues L2 and L3 in the 5'-CL1TL2TL3GL4-3' hairpin-loop motif, respectively. The other 31P resonances are located in a relatively narrow region between -0.6 and -1.4 ppm.

T13, T22 and T23) and to the unpaired thymidine bases (T28 and T29: not individually assigned). The 2D-NOESY experiments performed in H2 O at 292 K (data not shown) have confirmed the presence of all base-pairs in both molecules, including the central base-pairs, at this temperature. NOESY spectra of TWJ1 and TWJ2 in 2H2 O For a detailed structural analysis, the assignment of all protons is necessary. The sequence-specific assignment of non-exchangeable protons has largely been carried out following well-established procedures (Wuthrich, 1986). In cases where severe ¨ overlap in the NOESY spectrum hampers the sequential assignment, a slightly modified procedure, which is based on tracing all 5'-RY-3' and 5'-RYY-3' subfragments (R is pyrimidine and Y is purine) and subsequently assigning these subfragments to specific domains in the a priori known DNA sequence, is recommended (Chen et al., 1991; Pikkemaat et al., 1994). In addition, by acquiring NOESY spectra at two different temperatures most of the overlapping cross-peaks were resolved. Stereospecific assignments for the H2' and H2" resonances were carried out on the basis of the

relative intensity of the H1'-H2' and H1'-H2" cross-peak in the 80 ms NOESY spectrum, where the most intense NOE was assigned to the H2". In cases where spectral overlap precludes such a determination, the resonance at higher field was attributed to the H2'. In B-DNA, the H2' almost always resonates upfield with respect to the H2". Exceptions to this rule mainly occur in non-B-DNA conformations such as in DNA quadruplexes (Smith & Feigon, 1993) and the rule also fails for 3'-terminal purine residues of double-helical structures (Altona, 1990). The base to H1' region of the NOESY spectrum (mixing time 180 ms) of TWJ1 in 2H2 O is shown in Figure 7. The sequential assignments of different parts of the molecule are shown in three separate panels (panel A, residues 1 to 13; B, residues 14 to 23; C, 24 to 36). The spectra reveal the existence of three doublehelical arms adopting a regular B-DNA conformation as is concluded from the presence of all NOEs that are characteristic for B-DNAtype helices: intraresidual H8/H6(n)-H1'/H2'/ H2"/H3'(n) and interresidual H8/H6(n)-H1'/ H2'/ H2"/H3'(n - 1) NOE connectivities. Sequential NOEs between H5/Me(n)-H1'/H2'/H2"(n - 1) further establish the right-handed sense of the three helical arms. The chemical shifts of all assigned protons of TWJ1 are listed in Table 1.

707 (1991; Chen & Chazin, 1994) and Pikkemaat et al. (1994), is indicative of increased motional flexibility in the centre, possibly originating from an equilibrium between two or more substates. From residue C8 the sequential assignment continues up to residue G27, via two minihairpin loops, the presence of which immediately follows from the typical NOE patterns (Pieters et al., 1990, Pikkemaat et al., 1994) shown by residues C11, T12, T13 and G14 (loop 1), and C21, T22, T23 and G24 (loop 2). We note that there are strong NOE connectivities between G17 and C18, the last residue of arm A and the first residue of arm B, respectively. In fact all NOEs characteristic for

The sequential-NOE path runs from the first residue in the sequence C1 to residue C7. Interestingly, it is interrupted between residues C7 and C8, indicating that the stacking interaction between these bases is distorted. Instead, a few relatively weak long-range NOEs between residues C7 and T28 are evident: H6/H5/H3'(C7)-Me(T28) and H2'/H2"(C7)-H6(T28) (not shown). The signals of both C7 and G30 have markedly larger line-widths than the other proton resonances, resulting in relatively weak NOEs for these protons.

ible. From G30 the connectivity runs to the end of the molecule up to residue G36. The sequential assignment of the non-exchangeable protons of TWJ2 proved to be relatively straightforward, once the assignment of TWJ1 was accomplished. As the concentration of TWJ2 was considerably lower than that of TWJ1 (1.2 mM versus 3 mM), fewer NOEs were visible. However, several interesting NOEs that are obscured by overlap in the NOESY spectrum of TWJ1, even at different temperatures, are uncovered in the spectra of TWJ2 (not shown) as the corresponding resonances are better resolved. For example, we note that H2" of residue C7 resonates upfield relative to H2'. As mentioned earlier, this feature is commonly observed for 3'-terminal purine residues of B-DNA double helices and implies that C7 is more or less located at the 3' end of a double-helical segment. The majority of chemical shifts of TWJ2 are identical with those of TWJ1 within 20.04 ppm, except for the residues that are in close spatial proximity to the switched base-pair C17·G8. Hence, only the chemical shifts of these residues are listed in Table 2. Again, the sequential connectivity between residues C7 and G8 seems to be disrupted. The appearance of strong NOE cross-peaks between residues C17 and C18 and long-range NOEs between G27 and G8 indicate that arm A and arm B are colinearly stacked, as in TWJ1. No cross-peak between the sequential residues G27 and T28 is visible although cross-peak overlap precludes absolute certainty on this point. A few NOEs between the sequential residues T28 and T29 were distinguishable: H2"/H6(T28)-Me(T29) and H3'(T28)-H6(T29).

Discussion
B-DNA are observable, except for the H3'(G17)H6(C18). Two of these NOEs, H1'(G17)-H6(C18) and H8(G17)-H5(C18), are visible in Figure 7 and marked with a circle (labelled a and b). From G27, only a few weak NOEs to the next residue T28 are found, H8/H1'/H3'(G27)-5CH3 (T28), and an unusual, relatively strong H4'(G27)-5CH3 (T28). Clearly, the stacking between the bases G27 and T28 is severely distorted. However, several long-range NOEs from G27 to C8, the first residue in the second arm, are observed. Again, these are all B-DNA-type NOEs, two of which are marked with a circle (labelled c and d) in Figure 7. The presence of these NOEs, together with the absence of interresidual NOEs between residues C7 and C8, strongly indicate that arm A and arm B are colinearly stacked. No less than 12 NOE contacts are found between the unpaired thymine residues T28 and T29: H6/H2'/H2"/H3'/H4'(T28)-5CH3 (T29), H1'/ H2'/H2"/H3'(T28)-H6(T29) and weak H1'/H2'/ H2"(T28)-H4'(T29). The standard connectivity pattern between T29 and G30, the first residue in arm C, is interrupted. Instead, a weak NOE H3'(T29)-H8(G30) and a highly unusual and relatively intense NOE H4'(T29)-H8(G30) are visComparison of the NMR spectra of TWJ1 and TWJ2 From the 1D and 2D NMR data shown above, it is evident that two minihairpin loops are present in both molecules.

a Systematic list of interresidual NOEs expected at the centre of the three-way junction in case of conformer TWJ1-I (TWJ1-II). B-DNA-type stacking is assumed between the four residues, G17, C18, G27 and C8. Short sequential distances involving H3', H4', H5' and H5" are not considered. b Experimental evidence for the presence of cross-peaks in the 180 ms NOESY spectrum at 280 K and the 350 ms NOESY spectrum at 295 K at the positions associated with the theoretical NOEs predicted by model TWJ1-I (TWJ1-II). A positive sign symbolizes that the corresponding cross-peak was established unambiguously in the NOESY spectra; a minus sign denotes the complete absence of the cross-peak; a question mark indicates that no conclusion can be drawn due to spectral overlap in the NOESY spectrum at the position of the cross-peak concerned.

regions and the formation of 15 base-pairs provide strong evidence that both oligomers have folded into stable three-way junctions. These results agree with studies of other three-way junctions (Rosen & Patel, 1993a,b; Leontis et al., 1995) and four-way junctions (Chen et al., 1991; Chen & Chazin, 1994; Pikkemaat et al., 1994) in which the helices have been demonstrated to adopt a B-DNA conformation. The incorporation of two H2-type minihairpin loops into each molecule results in a remarkable stabilization relative to the TWJs studied by Rosen & Patel (1993a) and Leontis (1993, 1995): Tm is almost 20 K higher. These hairpin loops have been used successfully to stabilize four-way junctions (Pikkemaat et al., 1994). The observation of a considerable number of regular sequential NOEs between the central residues G17 and C18 and, more interesting, between the non-sequential residues G27 and C8, supplies convincing evidence that TWJ1 is mainly present in a conformation in which there is colinear stacking between arms A and B (conformer I in Figure 1(a)). In order to obtain as much evidence as possible for this strong conformational preference, both 180 ms NOESY (280 K) and a 350 ms NOESY (295 K) spectra were systematically checked for cross-peaks that are in correspondence with either conformer I or conformer II. The results are summarized in Table 3. Although some cross-peaks are not informative due to overlap, the observed NOEs strongly indicate sequential stacking of residues G17 and C18, and the absence of sequential stacking between residues C7 and C8.

Moreover, the presence of a substantial number of B-DNA-type long-range NOEs between residues G27 and C8 and the absence of these NOEs between residues G17 and G30, suggest that arm A is exclusively stacked upon arm B. This is fully consistent with the situation in conformer I. By contrast, the alternative conformer II could not be detected. Due to the lower quality of the spectra of TWJ2 compared with TWJ1, less information could be obtained; however, one can roughly deduce the same conformational features as for TWJ1. All possible NOEs between the central residues are traced and listed in Table 4. The NOEs are in accordance with the situation in conformer I. Again, no evidence was found revealing the occurrence of conformer II. The observation that TWJ2 adopts conformation I accords with the hypothesis that the tendency to optimize purine-purine stacking (G/G stack in TWJ2) across the junction directs which arms will colinearly stack. However, the fact that TWJ1 also prefers to exist in this conformation, in which purine-purine stacking (G/G) is replaced by purine-pyrimidine stacking (G/C) across the junction, contradicts this hypothesis. At this point, we conclude that the premise of optimal purine-purine stacking as the dominating factor in the choice of stacking partners of the helical arms is not supported by the present observations. The methyl proton chemical shifts and the NOE pattern of the unpaired residues T28 and T29 of both structures are highly similar, indicating that

710 the conformation of these residues is more or less the same. In both molecules the methyl protons of T28 and T29 resonate at relatively low field (1.81 and 1.68 ppm, respectively, in TWJ1; and 1.81 and 1.65 ppm, respectively, in TWJ2). The line-widths of the methyl and H6 protons display no unusual feature. The large number of normal strong NOE contacts between T28 and T29 suggests that T28 is, at least partly, stacked upon T29. Moreover, remarkable NOEs are found in both molecules between residues C7 and T28, H6/H5(C7)-Me(T28), and additional ones distinguishable only for TWJ1 in the 350 ms NOESY at 295 K, H6/H2'/H2"(C7)H6(T28), implying for the first time that residue T28 is partly stacked below residue C7 of arm C. This situation is strongly reminiscent of through stacking in a four-way junction. As yet, the exact orientation of the unpaired bases as well as details of the geometry of the through stack remains unclear. A model-building study of TWJ1 is in progress. Comparison of TWJ1 with TWJ-TT In order to make an easy comparison between the sequences of our molecules with TWJs studied by others, we propose to adopt a standard way to represent these structures schematically, as shown in Figures 1(a) and 2. When one now compares the structure of TWJ1 with the structure of TWJ-TT studied by Leontis et al. (1995), it is immediately obvious that the sequences of the bases flanking the branch-point are exactly the same in both molecules (Figure 8). Interestingly, TWJ-TT shows a high preference for conformer II, whereas TWJ1 is solely found as conformer I (Figure 8). This remarkable observation of two three-way junctions with exactly

the same base sequence in the centre, but showing a different stacking arrangement, allows the conclusion that the base sequence in the centre is not the only factor that causes preference of one conformer over another. There are certainly more factors involved that can outweigh the influence of the central bases. In particular, the nature of the bases one, or perhaps even more, base-pairs removed from the branch-point may be of substantial importance. Lu et al. (1991) have suggested that the penultimate base-pairs from the branch-point influence the conformation. However, they drew their conclusions on the basis of studies of tight three-way junctions in which coaxial stacking between two arms is not very plausible because in these structures there was no unpaired residue present at the branch-point that would permit a transition to a stacked arrangement. As was speculated by Leontis et al. (1995), salt concentrations could influence the choice of favoured conformation. TWJ-TT was studied in 100 mM NaCl in the presence of Mg2+ (5 mM), whereas TWJ1 was studied in 50 mM NaCl and in the absence of Mg2+. However, NMR spectra of a TWJ similar to TWJ1 and TWJ2, studied in our laboratory in the absence as well as in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+, did not show significant differences at these distinct conditions (unpublished results). Therefore, we consider it rather unlikely that magnesium ions are responsible for the differences in stacking arrangements between TWJ1 and TWJ-TT. These results are consistent with those reported by Rosen & Patel (1993a). At this point it should be mentioned that, ignoring the base sequence, conformer I and conformer II display intrinsic differences, in contrast to the

711 the two possible conformers is the most stable. Both compounds display a strong preference for the same conformer, indicating that purine-purine stacking does not govern the choice of stacking partner. On comparing the sequences and the stacking partners in the tertiary structure of TWJ1 with TWJ-TT studied by Leontis et al. (1995) it is evident that the base sequence at the branch-point is not the only factor that determines which of the two conformers predominates. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this folding process that probably plays an important role in determining the tertiary structure of branched DNA and RNA junctions in the living cell. Investigations, in particular regarding influences of sequence variation further removed from the branch-point, are in progress.

Materials and Methods
DNA synthesis DNA oligomers TWJ1 and TWJ2 were synthesized on a large scale (10 mmol) by solid-phase synthesis on a fully automated synthesizer (Gene Assembler, Pharmacia) using commercially available 2'-deoxynucleoside 3'-O(2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidites. Controlled pore glass (CPG-AP, 200 mg), covalently linked to the appropriate nucleoside, was used as solid support. After deprotection and cleavage from the polymer support by treatment (24 hours) with aqueous NH3 (25%) at 50°C, the oligonucleotides were analysed by fast protein liquid chromatography and purified on Sephadex G-50 (150 cm × 2 cm) using 0.05 M triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer both as solvent and as eluent. The appropriate fractions were pooled, concentrated to a small volume and co-evaporated with aqueous NH3 in order to remove excess triethylammonium bicarbonate. Elution through a column of Dowex 50W X4 cation-exchange resin (100 to 200 mesh, Na+ form) finally yielded the Na+ salts of the oligomers. NMR sample preparation The entire supply of the purified oligonucleotide was used for each NMR sample. The samples were dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5 to 7.0) containing 50 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM Na2 EDTA. DSS was added as a chemical shift reference. Next, the samples were freeze-dried and, after dissolving in 2H2 O (99.95 %), freeze-dried again. Subsequently, 500 ml 2H2 O (99.95%) was added resulting in oligomer concentrations of ca 3 mM for TWJ1 and 1.4 mM for TWJ2. In order to eliminate alternative (metastable) structures possibly formed during the sample preparation, all samples were heated to 80°C and slowly cooled to room temperature. For the observation of the exchangeable protons, the samples were freeze-dried and dissolved again in 500 ml of H2 O/2H2 O (85:15, v/v). NMR spectroscopy The 600 MHz 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX600 and Bruker DMX600 spectrometers. One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra in 2H2 O were accumulated in 16 K complex datapoints and the residual 1H2HO

Figure 8. A diagram showing the comparison between TWJ1 and TWJ-TT (studied by Leontis et al. 1995), represented as proposed in the text. Although the base sequences at the branch-point are identical in both molecules (surrounded by a box), TWJ1 shows a high preference for conformer I, whereas TWJ-TT prefers to exist as the alternative conformer II. The two penultimate base-pairs that are different in both molecules are represented in bold characters.

symmetrical situation in Holliday junctions. Upon inspection of Figure 8 it is manifest that, considering the 5' to 3' polarity of the sugar-phosphate backbone, in conformer I the two unpaired thymidine residues are ostensibly coming out of the coaxially stacked double helix, whereas in conformer II these residues are running into the helix. This difference in direction with respect to the quasicontinuous double helix between the strands containing the unpaired residues may be, in part, responsible for energetic differences between the two conformers. Indeed, the orientation of the unpaired thymidine bases in TWJ1 appears to differ significantly from that in TWJ-TT; in the former molecule 12 interresidual NOEs between the thymidine bases are observed, whereas only one or two between these bases in the latter case. Moreover, the conspicuous differences in chemical shift between the base and sugar protons of the analogous thymidine bases in TWJ1 and TWJ-TT provide further confirmation on this point. In summary, we have shown here that singlestranded DNA 36-mers can fold into stable three-way junctions that are suitable for detailed NMR studies. The results indicate that in the tertiary structure helix-helix stacking occurs. TWJ1 and TWJ2 were designed in order to verify ideas concerning the relative importance of purine-purine stacking across the junction in determining which of

signal was suppressed by weak irradiation at the 1H2HO frequency during the relaxation delay (1.0 s). The 1D-NMR spectra in H2 O were recorded with a spectral width of 12,019 Hz using a 1-3-3-1 selective excitation pulse sequence for water suppression (Hore, 1983). Homonuclear 2D-NMR experiments in 2H2 O were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode, using timeproportional phase incrementation (TPPI: Marion and Wuthrich, 1983). The 2D data sets were acquired with a ¨ 5405 Hz spectral width in both dimensions, 4 K complex data points in the t2 dimension and typically 400 to 512 increments in the t1 dimension. Suppression of the 1H2HO signal was achieved by presaturation at the 1H2HO frequency. NOESY experiments were carried out with mixing times of 80, 180 and 350 ms. TOCSY and Clean-TOCSY experiments were performed with 50 ms and 100 ms MLEV17 pulse sequences (Bax & Davis, 1985). NOESY spectra in H2 O were acquired with a 1-3-3-1 pulse as read pulse and a spectral width of 12,019 Hz in both dimensions. Typically, 600 to 750 free induction decays of 4 K complex data points were collected. Mixing times of 180 ms (TWJ2) and 170 ms (TWJ1) were used. One-dimensional 31P-NMR spectra were obtained at 242 MHz with broad-band proton decoupling. The spectral width was 4000 Hz with 4 K complex points. 31 P-NMR spectra were calibrated using 85% H3 PO4 as external chemical shift reference.

Note added in proof: After the submission of the final manuscript a recent electrophoresis study of 11 three-way junctions came to our attention (Welch, J. B., Walter, F. & Lilley, D. M. J. (1995). J. Mol. Biol. 251, 507­519. In that work it was concluded that the conformation of the bulged three-way junction is both ion- and sequence-dependent, moreover, it was found that sequence-beyond the central base-pairs can influence the conformation of the junction. These findings confirm and extend our results.
