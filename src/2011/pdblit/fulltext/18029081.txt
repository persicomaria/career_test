Abstract

The 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments for the oxidized A-chain of bovine insulin have been determined in aqueous and 30% trifluoroethanol/water solutions. Analysis of the observed medium-range nuclear Overhauser effects indicates that in aqueous solution significant populations of the peptide exist, with a 31o-helical conformation over residues 12-17. This region corresponds to helix A (13-20) in the crystal structure of the 2 Zn insulin hexamer. In 30% TFE solution, the NOE data are supportive of a random coil conformation throughout the peptide.

1. Introduction

Insulin is one of the most widely studied peptide hormones. The complete amino-acid sequence and the disulfide connectivities for the two chains of porcine insulin were first determined by Sanger and coworkers [1,2]. The A-chain of 21 amino acids is linked to the B-chain (30 amino acids) by two intermolecular disulfide bonds. A third intramolecular disulfide bridge links Cys-6 to C y s - l l of the A-chain. The X-ray crystal structure determined to 1.9 A resolution confirmed the connectivities of the disulfide bridges and defined the secondary and tertiary structure of the molecule [3]. Secondary structural features of the A-chain in the crystal structure include two helical regions, 1 - 8 and 13-20, connected by an extended polypeptide chain, 9 - 1 2 (Fig. 1). High-resolution NMR has been used to obtain both proton and carbon assignments for the insulin monomer in 33% trifluoroethanol [4,5]. Proton assignments for human insulin have been determined in 35% acetonitrile [6] and 20% acetic acid [7], the latter assignment leading to a

solution structure calculated using distance geometry [8]. These solvent conditions were chosen to achieve monomeric conditions, as previous ~H-NMR studies of insulin have been hampered by insulin's self-association properties. The sequential assignment of des-pentapeptideinsulin (DPI), an insulin analogue without the five Cterminal residues of the B-chain (as a model for monomeric insulin), in 20% acetic acid has been reported [9], and in aqueous solution [10,11], where a solution structure was also calculated. The solution structures obtained from 2DNMR studies [8,11] indicated that the major secondary structures present in the crystal structure were preserved in solution. It has been suggested [12] that the separated A- and B-chains contain sufficient structural information to form native insulin, which is formed in yields of 25-50% from oxidation of the reduced chains, refolding of the S-sulfonate chain or refolding of the scrambled molecule (randomly paired disulfides) [13]. Results from studies probing the secondary structure of the separate chains, however, vary considerably. The oxidized A-chain has been studied using circular dichroism (CD) and found to be unordered in aqueous solution [14,15], although it does contain some helix or fl-form in the presence of different surfactants [14]. The S-thiomethyl-protected A-chain and the reduced

chain (cysteines present as the sulfhydryl group) in an alkaline solution were shown to contain 15% and 13% a-helix, respectively, and 27% /3-structure by CD [16]. The latter results were supported by later FTIR studies [17], although it was noted that the helix content for the A-chain was lower than that for the intact molecule. High-resolution 1H-NMR has the advantage over both CD and VrlR of being able to determine not just the percentage a- or /3-structure of a protein, but also the positions of the secondary and tertiary structures. This paper presents t H-NMR data recorded for the oxidized A-chain of insulin in both aqueous and 30% trifluoroethanol-d 3 (TFE-d 3) solution. A sequence-specific assignment in both solutions was made. Analysis of the medium-range NOE connectivities indicated that in aqueous solution region 12-17 contained connectivities characteristic of 310-helical conformations. The number of these connectivities was reduced in the spectra from the TFE solutions, indicating that the helix present in aqueous solution is not stabilized by TFE in this instance.

The aqueous sample was prepared by dissolving A-chain (8 mg) in 0.5 ml of 90% H 2 0 / 1 0 % D20 and the pH adjusted to 4.3 using 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCI. The trifluoroethanol-d 3 solution was prepared by dissolving A-chain (4 mg) in 0.76 ml of 30% TFE-d 3 in distilled water. The pH of this solution was adjusted to 4.4, also using 1 M NaOH and HCI. The pH values given are direct meter readings with no adjustments for isotope effects. All samples were transferred to 5 mm 535-PP Wilmad NMR tubes after pH adjustment. All spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer. DQFCOSY and TOCSY (70 ms mixing time) spectra were collected with 32 transients and 512 t t increments. NOESY spectra were collected with 64 transients and 350 t t increments with mixing times of 100 and 250 ms. All spectra were recorded at 300 K with 2048 data points in t 2 and a spectral width of 5050 Hz. Suppression of the water resonance in both solvent systems was achieved by on-resonance irradiation of the solvent during the relaxation delay (2.0 s) for DQFCOSY and TOCSY experiments. Suppression of the solvent peak in NOESY experiments was achieved by selective excitation using a binomial 1 T pulse as the final read pulse, where the null point of the binomial pulse was set at the solvent frequency. Data processing was performed on either the spectrometer or a Silicon Graphics workstation using the Bruker data processing package UXNMR. Prior to Fourier transformation of NOESY and HOHAHA data, either a 90 °- or 60°-shifted sine-bell window function was applied in both dimensions. DQFCOSY data were treated with a 90 °shifted sine bell in both dimensions for the TFE solution, while data for the aqueous solution were treated with a 90°-shifted sine-squared window function. All data sets were zero-filled to yield a 2048 × 2048 data matrix prior to Fourier transformation.

3. Results

2. Materials and methods

The oxidized A-chain of insulin used in this study was obtained from Sigma and used without further purification.

A preliminary series of spectra was recorded to determine the optimum pH for structural studies. The pH of an unbuffered solution of oxidized A-chain (5-8 mg) in 0.5 ml 90% H 2 0 / 1 0 % D20 is approximately 5.2. Initial 2D experiments (particularly NOESY) revealed that at this pH the cross-peak intensities were too weak to enable a sequential assignment to be made. Studies at higher pH were therefore not attempted, as the exchange of amide protons is known to increase with pH. The slowest exchange rate for such protons normally occurs in the range pH 2 - 4 [18] but a sample of A-chain with the pH adjusted down to 3.5 aggregated within 30-60 min of preparation, resulting in a solid gel from which the peptide could not be recovered. At pH 4.3, the sample remained in solution for at least six months. When adjusted to pH 4.4, the TFE-d 3 solution also remained unaggregated long enough for data acquisi-

Hawkins et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1209 (1994) 177-182 tion, although small ' b e a d s ' appeared on the wall of the N M R tube after about three days, indicative of some form of aggregation. This did not appear to progress further and the effect on the spectra was not noticeable. The initial spin system assignment in aqueous solution was made using D Q F C O S Y and T O C S Y spectra by established methods [18]. Fig. 2 shows the fingerprint ( a H-NH) region of a 250 ms N O E S Y spectrum with the sequential assignment traced through. The dt~rq connectivity between a tyrosine and a g l u t a m i n e / g l u t a m a t e enabled Tyr-14 to be distinguished from Tyr-19, and a d e n connectivity from Gln-15 to Leu-16 confirmed the assignment of Leu-16. The a-proton chemical shifts for both Leu-16 and Glu-17 were similar, so that a sequential cross-peak was not visible. A dON cross-peak from Leu-16 to Glu-17 aided the assignment. Due to overlap, the amide proton of Cys-7 could not be unambiguously assigned. The chemical shifts of the /3CH 2 protons for all four cysteine residues (6, 7, 11, 20) were the same, as were the a-proton shifts. The assignment in 30% TFE solution was straightforward, as the spectra were similar to those obtained for the aqueous solution. In contrast to the spectra in aqueous solution, an a H i - N H i + t connectivity enabled the Gly-1

179

a H to be assigned. The two a-protons for Gly-1 appear to be degenerate, as the a H i - N H i+1 cross-peak was a single peak. Again, problems with overlap for the cysteine residues prevented a complete assignment for Cys-7. In contrast to the spectra in aqueous solution, the f l C H 2 protons for the three assignable cysteines (6, 11, 20) did not have the same chemical shifts, so that an assignment of the /3CH 2 protons for Cys-7 could not be made. The fingerprint region of a 250 ms N O E S Y spectrum with the sequential trace is shown in Fig. 3. One notable difference between the spectra in aqueous and T F E solutions is in the aromatic region and the side chain amines. In aqueous solution, the aromatic protons of each tyrosine were degenerate and the side chain amines for glutamine and arginine were almost degenerate. In 30% TFE, these chemical shifts were more dispersed. The assignments are summarized in Table 1. 3.1. Secondary structure A summary of the NOE connectivities in aqueous solution is given in Fig. 4. Helices generally have continuous regions of d ~ ( i , i + 1), d,~N(i,i + 3) and d ~ ( i , i + 3)

medium-range connectivities over the sequence Ser-12 to Glu-17 seen in Fig. 4 suggest that there is some helical structure in this region. An a-helix is characterized by d,~N(i,i + 4) connectivities and strong d ~ ( i , i + 3) connectivities, while d,~N(i,i + 2) connectivities are characteristic of a 310 helix. No clearly resolved d , ~ ( i , i + 3 ) connectivities were observed in the NOESY spectrum (these are often weaker in a 3t0 helix than in an a-helix), while the d,~N(i,i + 2) connectivities are quite distinct, indicating a preference for 310 helix over a-helix. A helical structure is further supported by the slowly exchanging amide protons of Leu-13 and Tyr-14, as well as the small coupling constants measured for residues 12-16. All the amide protons had completely exchanged within 30 min. Medium exchange was classified in this case as visible at 3 min, while 'slow' exchange protons were visible at 10 min. Another useful indicator of secondary structure is the a H chemical shift, with upfield shifts (relative to random coil values) corresponding to helical regions and downfield shifts to fl-sheet regions [19]. The a-proton chemical shifts for the C-terminal region of the A-chain were generally shifted upfield with respect to the random coil values, confirming the helical tendencies of this region. The possibility of conformational averaging must be considered when interpreting NMR data for short linear peptides [20]. In many instances, an equilibrium exists between ordered and random coil structures. The term 'nascent helix' has been used for an ensemble of conformations which are in equilibrium between extended, 3t0 and a-helix. In this situation the addition of TFE often shifts the equilibrium towards well-defined helix. It was therefore of interest to repeat the NMR analysis in 30% TFE.

4. Discussion
The results of these NMR studies show that in aqueous solution one of the two helices present in the crystal structure of the intact insulin hexamer is in part maintained in the isolated A-chain of the monomer. The fact that the N-terminal helix is not present in solution shows that the intrinsic helical tendency in this portion of the molecule is less than that in the C-terminal region. It is interesting to note that the helix that is present in aqueous solution has 310 characteristics, as does the same helix in the crystal structure of the insulin hexamer [3]. The two major differences between the A-chain in isolation and as part of the insulin monomer are the absence of both the B-chain and the disulfide bridges, both of which may be contributing factors in the reduction in helix for the isolated A-chain in solution when compared to the crystal structure. The absence of the cysteine residues is a major factor leading to the random coil conformation of the N-terminal region. The two interchain disulfide bridges, A 7 - B 7 and A20-B19, are positioned such that the intrachain cysteine, A 6 - A l l , three leucines (A16, B l l , B15) and the isoleucine (A2) are buried as a hydrophobic interior. This hydrophobic interior has been postulated as important in maintaining the structure of the monomer [3]. Removal of the disulfide bridges reduces the stability of the hydrophobic core. This is in agreement with CD studies of somatostatin by Wu and Yang [14], where removal of the disulfide bonds resulted in a reduction in ordered conformations. Another important finding in the current study relates to the lack of structure of the C-terminal region in TFE. This is of much general interest in studies of peptide conformation as TFE is traditionally regarded as a structure-promoting solvent. This study shows that this is not always the case, and for some peptides TFE may actually reduce ordered structure. While the mechanism for the effect is not clear, the observation itself is unequivocal and serves as an indication of the need for care in making assumptions about the effects of TFE on structure.

Fig. 5 shows a summary of the NOE data for the A-chain in 30% TFE. While TFE stabilizes secondary structure in many peptides, this appears not to be the case for the A-chain of insulin. In particular, the evidence for secondary structure (low 3 j ~ , , values and relatively slowly exchanging amides) present in aqueous solution over residues 12-17 has disappeared. In TFE a sequence of coupling constants, 3Jm~,~, with values < 6 at 15-17 is suggestive of some local structure, but this is not supported by NOE connectivities or slowly exchanging amide protons. The change in structure from water to TFE is most clearly illustrated by the chemical-shift indices [21] for a H-protons in the two solvents, as shown in Fig. 6. The chemical-shift index quantifies the location of helical or coil structures, and is derived from differences between observed chemical shifts and random coil shifts, with a value of + 1 assigned to residues where the chemical shift of the a-proton is downfield by at least 0.1 ppm from the random coil value and - 1 assigned to residues with an a-proton chemical shift upfield by at least 0.1 ppm. The sequence of negative indices for the aqueous solution, consistent with helix conformation in the C-terminal region, contrasts markedly with the indices determined in 30% TFE.
