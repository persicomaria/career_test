Abstract Ferredoxin I (Fd I) from Equisetum arvense is an iron-sulfur protein composed of 95 amino-acid residues and one [2Fe-2S] cluster. It crystallized in the space group P21, a = 30.4, b = 57.4, c = 47.5A and /3 = 78.7 ° with two molecules p e r asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data up to 1.8 A resolution were collected by using a Rigaku four-circle diffractometer. The initial model of Fd I, which was derived by the molecular replacement method using a structure of the Fd I from the blue-green alga Aphanothece sacrum, was refined by molecular dynamics simulation and a least-squares minimization with stereochemical restraints. Positional parameters and isotropic temperature factors for 1420 non-H protein atoms and 183 water molecules were refined on 13 838 observed structure factors (Fo > CrFo) between 10.0 and 1.8 A resolution. The final R factor was 17.0%, and the standard deviation of atomic position estimated by Luzzati plot [Luzzati (1952). Acta Cryst. 5, 802-810] was 0.2 A. The electron-density map was well defined for the two independent molecules except for the N-terminal residue and the three C-terminal residues. Equivalent Ca atoms of two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit were superposed by the leastsquares method with root-mean-square deviations of 0.26 A. Reasonable structural differences were observed at a polypeptide segment having few intramolecular interactions. Highly flexible regions of the molecule were assigned from the structural differences between the two independent molecules in the crystal and the distribution of temperature factors along the polypeptide chain.

systems with low redox potentials at about -400mV (Lovenberg, 1973, 1977). They have been isolated from a wide range of plants and algae, and contain two Fe and two inorganic S atoms, [2Fe-2S] (Matsubara & Saeki, 1992). They are composed of 93-99 amino-acid residues; the amino-acid sequences of typical plant-type Fd's (Matsubara & Hase, 1983) are given in Fig. 1. The sequences are apparently homologous to each other. The crystal structures of [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins from Spirulina platensis (Fukuyama et aL, 1980; Tsukihara et al., 1981), Aphanothece sacrum (Tsukihara et aL, 1990) and anabaena 7120 (Rypniewski et aL, 1991) were solved at 2.5, 2.2 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. These three Fd's exhibit essentially the same polypeptide-chain folding. Similar folding motifs were found in ubiquitin (Vijay-Kumar, Bugg & Cook, 1987) and the IgG-binding domain of protein G (Gronenborn et al., 1991), both of which are functionally distinct and unrelated in sequence to Fd's. The [2Fe-2S] Fd I from Equisetum arvense consists of 95 amino-acid residues (Hase, Wada & Matsubara, 1977) and has a relative molecular mass of 10 263. The amino-acid sequence of this protein differs from that of the A. sacrum Fd I by 58%. Although the threedimensional structures for the three Fd's are known at medium resolution, a detailed structure is required for the design of a protein-engineering protocol (Hase, personal communication) and for correlation with the results of spectroscopic studies (Mino, Loehr, Wada, Matsubara & Sanders-Loehr, 1987; Dugad, LaMar, Banci & Bertini, 1990; Oh & Markley, 1990). The crystals of E. arvense Fd I diffract to at least 1.8A resolution and are suitable for high-resolution X-ray analysis. As an asymmetric unit of the crystal consists of two molecules, the structures of these molecules were compared to discover any structural flexibility in [2Fe-2S] Fd's. Here we report the crystal structure of E. arvense Fd I at 1.8 A resolution, which is the most extensively refined [2Fe-2S] Fd structure.

FERREDOXIN I

Crystallization and X-ray experiments
The [2Fe-2S] Fd of E. a r v e n s e was crystallized by the microdialysis technique. A protein solution comprising 1.0-2.0% Fd and 0.35 M NaC1 in 0.1 M Tris/HC1 buffer (pH 7.5) was dialyzed against 70% saturated ammonium sulfate in the same buffer at 278 K. Crystals grew to the size of about 0.3 x 0.3 x 0 . 6 m m in about one month. The space group is P21 with cell dimensions a = 30.4, b -- 57.4, c -- 47.5 ,/k and/3 = 78.7 °. Assuming that the asymmetric unit contains two molecules, the I'm is 1.98 A 3 Da -1 (Matthews, 1968); the low value of I'm indicates tight packing of the protein molecules in the crystal. Intensity data were collected at 281 K by the continuous w-scanning method on a Rigaku four-circle diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu K a radiation operated at 40 kV and 200mA. Each crystal was mounted in a thin-wall capillary with the b axis parallel to the q~ axis of the goniometer. Backgrounds were measured at each end of the scanning range for 1/5 to 1/4 of the total scanning period. The intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization factors. A set of intensity data for the strong reflections within 1.8 A resolution was used to scale intensity data sets. Four crystals were used to collect a full data set to 1.8/~,. The degradation of the crystals as a result of radiation damage was monitored by measuring intensities of standard reflections every 200 reflections. Intensities of the first several hundred reflections in each data collection were remeasured at the end of experiment in order to estimate the resolution dependence of the damage. Correction for the radiation damage was made with regard to an exposure period and the diffraction angle. An absorption correction was made according to the method described by North, Phillips & Matthews (1968). The intensities were also corrected as a function of the X value of the diffractometer to minimize the deviation of the averaged ratio of F ( h k l ) / F ( h f d ) in each subset from 1.0; for some data sets these values deviated significantly from 1.0 at high X angle. A total of about 21 000 independent reflections with Bijvoet pairs

were obtained by averaging equivalent F values with weights 1/(o'F) 2. Some statistics of the observed structure factors are given in Table 1. Respective averaged structure amplitudes for reflections o f h + k = 2n a n d h + k = 2n + 1 are shown in Fig. 2. The intensities for h + k = 2n are significantly greater than those for h + k = 2n + 1 at low resolution. This indicates that the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by pseudo-C face-centered symmetry.

Structure determination
Structural model at low resolution

A Bijvoet difference Patterson function was calculated with coefficients of IF(hkl) - F(hkl)l 2 at 5 A resolution to determine positions of [2Fe-2S] centers in the unit cell. Two [2Fe-2S] centers in the asymmetric unit were located at (0.523, 0.0, 0.064) and (0.023, 0.5, 0.064), which were related to one another by the C face-centered symmetry. Fixing the active centers at the above positions, the model molecules whose main-chain structures were the same as that of A. s a c r u m Fd (Tsukihara et al., 1990) were rotated and the R factor, R = EIIFol - IFcl] /EIFol, was calculated at each orientation. The resultant R-factor distribution gave 19 local minima. Out of 19 trial structures, nine were rejected because of overlap among molecules in the crystal. For each of ten trial structures an anomalousdifference Fourier map was composed with coefficients of [F(hkl) - F ( h k l ) ] e x p ( a c - n/2) at 5 A resolution, where a¢ is a phase angle from the atomic coordinates of the model. Only one of ten Fourier maps showed reasonable peaks at the expected sites for the [2Fe-2S] clusters. Consequently, a unique structural model was selected.
Structure refinement

In order to resolve the C face-centered symmetry of the model structure, two molecules with [2Fe-2S] centers at (0.523, 0.0, 0.064) and (0.023, 0.5, 0.064) were translated by (dx, dy, dz) and (-dx, -dy, -dz),

respectively, and the R factor for the reflections between 6 and 3 ,/k resolution was calculated at each translational position. The minimum R value was 0.353 at the translational position of (dx, dy, dz) -- (0.010, -0.003, 0.002) in fractional coordinates. Assuming the molecules were rigid bodies, we refined six positional and six rotational parameters for two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit with reflections between 5 and 2.5 A resolution by C O R E L S (Sussman, 1985). After the several cycles of the refinement, all the translational and the rotational parameters converged well and the R value was reduced from 0.405 to 0.376. The structure was refined at 2.5 A resolution by restrained least-squares refinement (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980). After 45 cycles of the refinement the R value was reduced to 27.2%. Although further refinement was continued at 2.2/~ resolution, it was time-consuming to remove false minima by manual revision. Thus, we switched from the restrained least-squares method to a simulated-annealing (SA) method with the program X - P L O R (Brfinger, 1988). The SA refinement procedure is given in Table 2. The first to the fourth steps of the refinement consisted of heating and cooling stages. Further repetitions of the refinement were carried out by slow cooling. Abnormal structures were corrected by using F R O D O in a (2Fo F¢) omit map calculated according to Bhat (1988) after each repetition from the first to sixth refinement. Water molecules were picked up in a (2Fo - F~) map or a (Fo - F¢) map. The structures of protein molecules as well as those of water molecules were refined by the restrained least-squares refinement at 1.8 A resolution.
120

Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit were released during the SA refinements at 2.2 and 1.8 A resolution and the restrained refinement at 1.8 A resolution. Solvent sites and protein structures were manually revised every 15 to 30 cycles of the refinement in the (Fo - Fc) and (2Fo - Fc) maps. The occupancies of all atoms were fixed at 1.0. Positional and individual thermal parameters for 1420 non-H protein atoms and 183 water molecules were refined at the final stage of the refinement. Several cycles of the final refinement were carried out without structural restraints for [2Fe-2S] centers. After 430 cycles of the refinement the R factor was reduced to 0.170 for 13 838 reflections (F > lO'F) in the resolution range 10.0-1.8 A. The final weights for the restraints and the final deviations from idealities are listed in Table 3. The distribution of the R factors as a function of 2sin0/A (Fig. 3) indicates that the estimated r.m.s, error of the atomic positions (Luzzati, 1952) is about 0.2A. The coordinates and individual temperature factors of the present molecules have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977).*

Most parts of the final structure for each molecule fit well to the (2Fo - Fc) map except the N-terminal and three C-terminal residues. The following atoms were located in lower electron-density regions than the others.

The main-chain fold and the active center of molecule A are shown in Fig. 4. i3-sheets are formed by the residues Tyr2-Thr8, Glyl 1-Val7, Lys49-Va151 and Asp83-Glu87 at the bottom of the standard view, and a-helices by residues Ile23-Ala30, Asp65-Glu70 and Glu91-Phe95. Only one a-helix had been assigned in each molecule of A. sacrum and S. platensis Fd's, which corresponds to the a-helix of Ile23-Ala30 of the E.

arvense Fd. The helix of Asp65-Glu70 for the present Fd was located clearly in the electron-density distribution as the residues between 67 and 73 of anabaena 7120 Fd (Rypniewski et al., 1991). A probable reason why the helical structure corresponding to the helix of Asp65-Glu70 of E. arvense was not detected in A. sacrum and S. platensis Fd's is that the corresponding regions of these algal Fd's were poor in electron-density distribution. Several residues at the C terminus were located in low electron-density regions and/or have high

temperature factors for all [2Fe-2S] Fd's so far investigated crystallographically. There may be high flexibility in this region for the [2Fe-2S] Fd's. The Ramachandran plot of molecules A and B is shown in Fig. 5, which indicates that c~-helical and fl-structural conformations are prominent. Six out of nine glycine residues of the molecules are outside the 'extreme limiting contact region' given for polyalanine by Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran (1965).

Structure of the [2Fe-2S] active center Bond distances and angles of [2Fe-2S] active centers for the two independent molecules together with their average values are listed in Table 4. The structures of the active centers of the two molecules in an asymmetric unit are identical to each other within experimental errors. The polypeptide loop around the [2Fe-2S] center is shown in Fig. 6. The two Fe atoms are coordinated tetrahedrally by two inorganic S atoms and two cysteinyl S atoms like those found in other [2Fe-2S] Fd's. One Fe atom is coordinated by the S-y atoms of Cys38 and Cys43 and the other by those of Cys46 and Cys76.

IKEMIZU, BANDO, SATO, MORIMOTO, TSUKIHARA AND FUKUYAMA An Fe--Fe distance of 2.76 ]k indicates a metal-metal interaction and a distance between two inorganic S atoms (S*) of 3.49/~ is too long for any significant bonding between the atoms as in the synthetic analogs (Mayerle, Denmark, DePamphilis, Ibers & Holm, 1975). Fig. 7 shows torsion about the Fe--S7 bonds in which ST--Cfl angles are about 60 ° for three cases and 30 ° for one case. This is consistent with the statistics of the torsion angles for the [4Fe-4S] cluster in several iron-sulfur proteins (Bernstein et al., 1977; Adman, Sieker, & Jensen, 1976; Carter, Kraut, Freer & Alden, 1974), in which 31 out of 57 torsion angles are within the angle range 60(15) °. NH-..S and OTH.-.S hydrogen bonds around the [2Fe-2S] cluster given in Table 5 stabilize the loop structure around the active center. Most of the hydrogen bonds are conserved among the known plant and algal [2Fe-2S] Fd's.
Intermolecular interaction and molecular packing

171

A stereoview of the molecular packing is shown in Fig. 8. Eight types of intermolecular interaction (Table 6 and Fig. 9) were assigned. Interactions I, IV and V are related by pseudo (a + b)/2-translational symmetries to I', IV' and V', respectively. Interactions II and III have pseudo-twofold symmetries within themselves.
Structural comparison between molecules A and B

The displacement of each residue is given in Fig. 10. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of equivalent Ca atoms of two independent molecules superposed by a least-squares program SUPPOS (Nishikawa & Ooi, 1980) was 0.26,/k. The displacements of corresponding Ca atoms of two molecules are larger than 0.3/~ for the residues of Alal, Vall7-Glul9, Gly53-Ser54, Gly60-Ser61, Gin67, Glu69-Glu70, Ser82 and Glu92Phe95.

molecules are located in poor electron-density regions and the temperature factors for these residues are very high (Fig. 12). This indicates that the residues are flexible even in the crystal. There may be several factors which cause distortion of the molecules. Gly53 residues of molecules A and B are in close contact with each other at a pseudo-twofold axis (Fig. l la). The close contact causes structural differences between the two Gly53 residues of molecules A and B by 0.38/~ at the Ca position. Except for both polypeptide termini the two molecules exhibit the largest structural difference of 0.6/~, at Ca of Glu 19 (Fig. 11 b). The side-chain atoms, C6 and Oe 1, of Glu 19 of molecule A interact with atoms of another molecule in

the interaction scheme IV. On the other hand, C/3, C7, C6, and Oel of G l u l 9 of molecule B contact closely with other molecules in the schemes I', IV' and V. These different interaction schemes result in the large structural difference between two molecules around Glul9. A superposition of the segment Gly60-Ser61-Phe62 of molecules A and B is shown in Fig. ll(c). The displacements for 6 1 0 and 61Cc~ are 0.9 and 0.5 ,/k, respectively. This might be caused by a hydrogen bond between a water molecule and 0 7 of Ser61 of molecule A. The similar perturbation by a hydrogen bond between a water molecule and a carbonyl O atom is found for Pro9, where a carbonyl O atom at Pro9 of molecule A is as far as 0.5/~ from that of molecule B.

Fig. 12. Temperature factors of the residues for molecules A (open circles) and B (closed circles). Each value was estimated by averaging over the temperature factors of the main-chain atoms in a given residue.

Fig. 12 shows temperature factors of main-chain atoms for molecules A and B. It is obvious that the temperature factors of the two molecules are highly correlated. They have a correlation coefficient of 0.98, which is defined by the formula,
~-~(BAi - BA)(BBi - BB)/[Y~,(BAi - BA)2(BBi - BB)2]II 2,

where Bai and BBi are temperature factors of ith residues of molecules A and B, and Ba and BB are the average temperature factors of molecules A and B, respectively. Thus, both molecules preserve a common elastic feature in the crystalline state. The residues with large structural differences between the two molecules have high temperature factors. We are grateful to Mr Sigeo Sawada for his help in preparation and crystallization of the protein and to Mr Kazuhiko Takahashi for his help in intensity data processing.
