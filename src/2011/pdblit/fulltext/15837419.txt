Evolutionary relationships between viruses may be obscure by protein sequence but unmasked by structure. Analysis of bacteriophage T5 by cryoelectron microscopy and protein sequence analysis reveals analogies with HK97 and T4 that suggest a mosaic of such connections. The T5 capsid is consistent with the HK97 capsid protein fold but has a different geometry, incorporating three additional hexamers on each icosahedral facet. Similarly to HK97, the T5 major capsid protein has an N-terminal extension, or -domain that is missing in the mature capsid, and by analogy with HK97, may function as an assembly or scaffold domain. This -domain is predicted to be largely coiled-coil, as for that of HK97, but is 70% longer correlating with the larger capsid. Thus, capsid architecture appears likely to be specified by the -domain. Unlike HK97, the T5 capsid binds a decoration protein in the center of each hexamer similarly to the "hoc" protein of phage T4, suggesting a common role for these molecules. The tailtube has unusual trimeric symmetry that may aid in the unique two-stage DNA-ejection process, and joins the tail-tip at a disk where tail fibers attach. This intriguing mix of characteristics embodied by phage T5 offers insights into virus assembly, subunit function, and the evolutionary connections between related viruses.

Introduction
T5 is one of seven tailed bacteriophages targeting Escherichia coli that were named T or Type phages by Delbrück in 1944. It belongs to the Siphoviridae family that includes phages  and HK97 and is characterized by a long flexible non-contractile tail attached to an isometric icosahedral capsid containing the double-stranded (ds) DNA genome. Bacteriophage T5 is the type-member of a genus that includes around 20 other poorly characterized members.1 Several features make T5 an unusual and remarkable phage.2 Its 121,750 bp genome is the largest of the so-called T-odd viruses (i.e. T1, T3, T5

and T7) and carries single-stranded interruptions at genetically defined positions on one of the DNA strands as well as large terminal redundancies in the form of 10,160 direct repeats. Transport of the genome into the host occurs by a unique two step process: 8% of the genome is transferred initially, allowing production of pre-early phage-encoded proteins that are necessary for transport of the remaining DNA.3 T5 also contains some of the strongest known prokaryotic promoters.2 Remarkably, most of these features have been known since the 1960s and 1970s, but in comparison to phages , T4 or T7 we have only a poor understanding of the molecular events occurring during the infection process. Most morphological data concerning T5 come from negative stain electron microscopy.4,5 The T5 capsid has an average diameter of 900 Å, a planar icosahedral outline, and a flexible tail of 120 Å diameter with a total length of 2500 Å. The tail ends in a conical structure to whose tip is attached a 500 Å long straight fiber that crosses the host envelope upon infection.3 Three L-shaped fibers, joining the

994 distal end of tail-tube, permit attachment to the host, and the tail-tube itself appears to be assembled from trimeric rings 6 rather than hexameric rings as observed in most other phage tails. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) of phage particles interacting with their purified host receptor, the outer membrane protein FhuA, shows similar general features7,8 such as a well preserved and regular capsid whose shape is consistent with icosahedral symmetry. However, the larger diameter of the T5 capsid compared to that of other Siphoviridae such as  and HK97 suggests that the subunit organization is likely to be different, in particular with a triangulation number t > 7 seen for these other capsids. Biochemical studies previously identified pb8 as the major capsid protein (730 copies/phage particle) and pb10 as a secondary head protein (114 copies/ particle)9,10 that is dispensable for infectivity.4 Saigo further proposed that pb10 is a "decoration protein" analogous to the T4 hoc protein, since both are found in 1:6 molar ratio with their respective major head proteins. However, examination of the T5 genome (NCBI Entrez ID, AY692264) reveals a pattern of genes encoding capsid proteins that is more similar to phages  and HK97 than to T4. Located upstream of the major head protein are the terminases, the pb7 portal protein, pb10 and a head maturational protease, pb11. Notable are two features shared by T5 and HK97 phages: one is the absence of a gene encoding a scaffolding protein that is commonly employed by capsids of 500 Å diameter or larger for assembly but expelled from the capsid before DNA packaging, and the second is the proteolytic removal of a substantial portion of the major head protein from the N terminus. For HK97, the 102 residue N-terminal domain of the gp5 capsid protein is proposed to aid in assembly of the capsid and is subsequently cleaved leaving 282 residues in the mature protein,11 whereas the T5 pb8 protein is also N-terminally trimmed from a 50 kDa precursor to the 32 kDa mature form.9 Together, these features suggest that T5 and HK97 may share a similar capsid assembly strategy directed by the N-terminal "assembly" domains although yielding differently sized structures. We have embarked on a program of structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy and threedimensional image reconstruction, beginning with the more straightforward targets such as the icosahedral capsid and the helical tail, but aiming ultimately for as complete a rendering as possible of the entire T5 phage. Unusual and therefore interesting aspects of T5 morphology are in our immediate sights, such as the structure and assembly pathway of the relatively large capsid compared to  and HK97, the location and role of the pb10 decoration protein, the organization of the encapsidated DNA and its effect on capsid structure, as well as the structure of the connector­tail-tip complex and the organization of the helical tail-tube. Recent sequencing of the T5 genome (NCBI Entrez IDs, AY587007,12 AY692264 and AY543070) offers considerable support for the present work. By comparing our new structural knowledge with data

available for other viruses, we gain an understanding about what is common among such complex multi-component molecular machines, suggesting a web of evolutionary connections, as well as what makes T5 unique.

Results
Capsid structure by cryoEM Cryo-electron micrographs reveal T5 phage particles with regular, angular capsids and long tails that are generally straight, although neither tip nor fibers are readily visible (Figure 1(a)). Dark capsids are filled with the viral genome and light capsids appear completely devoid of DNA. We assume that the latter are mature capsids that have been subsequently emptied of their DNA since they have tails attached, an assembly step that follows DNA packaging. Particles were selected and subjected to analysis using a negative-stain reconstruction as a starting point (see Supplementary Data), yielding a cryoEM structure of 20 Å resolution (Figure 1(b)). The organization of pentameric capsomers at the vertices and hexameric capsomers elsewhere, arranged on a t = 13 lattice, is clearly visualized. Two alternative hands are possible, one is the mirror image of the other, but the correct one cannot be determined in such an analysis and t = 13l (laevo) has been chosen arbitrarily, although with some evidence in its favor from the t = 13l end-caps of phage T213 and the giant head of phage T4.14 The sectioned views (Figure 1(c) and (d)) show planar walls of 40 Å thickness and apparent layering of dsDNA, similar to the DNA patterns observed in reconstructions of the T7 head,15,16 as well as the mutant isometric particle of T4 that shares the same t = 13 geometry17 and the prolate T4 head.18 Visualization of this layering is consistent with the spool model established for T7 and the imposition of icosahedral symmetry.15 On the radial density profile (Figure 1(g)), ten layers are indicated ranging over radii from 160 Å ­380 Å and yielding an average spacing of 24.4 Å. The structure of the empty capsid obtained by urea treatment is resolved at 19 Å resolution, similar to that of the full head particle but with generally improved features due to the absence of coprojected DNA. The exterior surface (Figure 1(e)) resembles the DNA-filled head, while the interior view (Figure 1(f)) shows cavities under each capsomer with a central dimple and six satellite dimples, similar to the HK97 head.19 Radial profiles of the density distributions were calculated from the empty and full capsid structures (Figure 1(g)), and mutually calibrated with reconstructions that were derived from the same micrographs although to a lower resolution than shown here (data not shown). Unexpectedly, the radial profile of the empty capsid has a higher average radius than the full capsid, despite the lack of internal pressure from packaged DNA. In particular, the capsid walls near the 2-fold

Figure 1. CryoEM visualization of phage T5. (a) Area from a cryo-electron micrograph of DNA-filled phage particles and including two empty particles. Capsids viewed along symmetry axes have distinctive appearances, such as the hexagonal views that indicate 3-fold axis (an example is marked with 3), and the chevrons of the 2-fold axis (marked with 2). The ice layer traps the tails, largely limiting the orientations of the capsids to freedom of rotation about the tail axis. Tails show a banded pattern with repeat of 43.8 Å. Inset are images of particles taken closer-to-focus where the microscope contrast transfer function does not interfere with the DNA duplex spacing. Various patterns of DNA are visible, including a swirling pattern (top), striations (middle), and punctate appearance (bottom). The bars represent 500 Å. Views of the DNA-filled head particle reconstruction along an icosahedral 2-fold axis include (b) the exterior surface, (c) the sectioned surface view with the front half of the capsid density removed, and (d) the central section corresponding to this sectioning plane. Corresponding views of the reconstruction from empty mature capsids obtained by urea treatment include (e) the exterior surface and (f) the interior surface where the interior capsid surface is visualized. The bar represents 200 Å. (g) Radial density profiles reveal the averaged layer spacing of the packaged DNA to be 24.4 Å, and that the empty capsid has a slightly larger average radius than the DNA-filled head. Arrows in (c), (d) and (f) indicate positions on the icosahedral 2-fold axis where the DNA-filled capsid appears slightly bowed in comparison to the empty capsid.

996 axes (Figure 1(f)) appear straighter than for the full capsid (Figure 1(c)) where they are slightly bowed in by about 10 Å reducing the diameter to 820 Å. In comparison we detect no change in the 940 Å diameter across the 5-fold axes. It is likely that the accompanying conformational changes are the consequence of DNA release rather than to the urea treatment, since they were also observed on T5 particles that had released their DNA in vitro upon binding to their host receptor FhuA (data not shown). The subunits of the hexameric and pentameric capsomers appear similar--on the exterior, a ridge extends along the surface radially away from the central axis of each capsomer. Biochemical characterization of the capsid has indicated only a single major capsid protein, pb8, which we propose to be the subunit for both the pentamers and hexamers, as is the case for other Siphoviridae such as  (gpE) and HK97 (gp5). Apart from the numbers of subunits, the hexamers differ from pentamers by the presence of a lump of density extending outwardly along the local symmetry axis from the center of each capsomer. This density is only weakly continuous with the underlying capsid, allowing us to estimate its volume as being consistent with a polypeptide, or polypeptides, totaling 160 amino acid residues. The lack of a strong connection suggests that this density is not an extension of the capsid protein, and indeed it may be removed progressively by incubation with 4 M guanidine­HCl (Figure 2(a)). Absence of similar density on pentamers further supports assignment of the lump as a decoration protein while the weak connection to the hexamer indicates that it is not present in a 1:1 ratio with the underlying hexamer subunits. This is consistent with the molecule being located on the local quasi-6-fold axis, occupying roughly the same volume but in different orientations at equivalent sites on the capsid surface, and

Phage T5 is Structurally Similar to HK97 and T4

associating with any one of the six available hexamer binding sites in a pattern that is random over equivalent positions within and between capsids. A candidate protein for this decoration density is pb10, of which a monomer, 164 amino acid residues, would account for the volume of the lump. The molar ratio with pb8 would be 120:780 or 1:6.5, close to the biochemical assessment of 1:610 and consistent with there being a symmetry mismatch between the lump and the underlying hexamer. This apparently unlikely arrangement is not without precedent, having been established for the hoc protein of phage T4.20 To test our hypothesis, we determined the capsid structure of a T5 mutant (T5st amN5) that produces empty heads lacking pb10 as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis10 (Figure 2(b)). The main difference between this structure and the mature head capsid is the absence of the lumps, confirming our assignment of the hexamer-associated lump as a monomer of pb10. Modeling the T5 capsid with the HK97 capsid protein The mature capsid proteins of phages T5 and HK97 have similar lengths, 299 and 282 amino acids, respectively, and the morphology of their capsomers is also similar. We modeled the T5 capsid by fitting a pentamer and a hexamer of the mature HK97 capsid21 as a solid body into the T5 cryoEM density map (Figure 3). Fits of subunit atomic models into cryoEM density maps of similar resolution have proven accurate to within 1­2 Å deviation of the C atoms.22,23 The angle between the two capsomers needed no adjustment, but a small displacement of the hexamer by 5 Å away from the pentamer was necessary to properly center it on the local symmetry axis. Visually, the resulting fit is very good, with only a small region at the outer surface unoccupied that may be attributed to the smaller size of the HK97 protein used for fitting (see below). Several small loops of the HK97 gp5 extend beyond the T5 capsid envelope, but these are near the hoc-like density of T5 for which there is no analog in HK97 and thus some divergence may be expected between the capsid structures at this location. Similarly, the E-loop of HK97 gp5 is only partially embedded in the T5 density map, and is again a region of divergent function having a unique role in the unusual covalent crosslink that generates interlinked rings in the mature HK97 head.24,25 This is a stabilizing mechanism that T5 does not employ according to an absence of capsid protein oligomers in SDS-PAGE (data not shown)10 as well as sequence comparison (see below). Protein sequence comparison between T5 and HK97 The above results highlight the structural comparison between the T5 and HK97 mature capsids. We extended this analysis by comparing the sequences of their major capsid proteins. HK97 dispenses with a separate scaffolding gene for guiding capsid

The decoration density (arrow) is greatly diminished after 1 h and has disappeared after 3 h. The bar represents 100 Å.

997 from a larger 50 kDa protein9 encoded by the pb8 gene (NCBI Entrez ID, AY692264). N-terminal sequencing of the mature pb8 (P.B. et al., unpublished results) indicates that the amino-terminal 159 residues have been removed, presumably by a putative prohead protease identified on the genome. This excised T5 -domain is 60% longer than that of HK97 but also has a high prediction for coiled-coil and in particular the 102 residues that overlap with those of HK97 have a remarkably similar prediction pattern (Figure 4(a)). Given the apparent lack of a scaffold gene in the T5 genome, we propose that the pb8 -domain serves an assembly role as for HK97. Alignment of the mature T5 and HK97 capsid protein sequences by PSI-BLAST (Figure 4(b)) yields an amino acid identity of 20%, similar to the 17% found between structurally equivalent regions of HK97 and the T4 capsid vertex protein, gp24, which adopts the same core fold.27 However, several threading algorithms score the T5 capsid protein sequence significantly higher than T4 gp24 against the HK97 structure, suggesting that the T5 protein may more closely resemble the HK97 fold (see Supplementary Data). The PSI-BLAST alignment introduced several small gaps into the HK97 sequence, corresponding to insertions in T5 pb8. The largest, eight residues, is at the position of helix 5 and this region of the HK97 subunit does not fit well into the T5 capsid density (Figure 3, pink circle). Gaps also occur at the positions of the HK97 "chainmail" cross-linking residues: Lys169, located in the E-loop (Figure 3, black circle); Asn356; and the putative catalytic residue, Glu363.24,25 However, no crosslink triad is evident in T5 pb8 by alignment, supporting biochemical evidence that the T5 capsid protein does not crosslink, and so differences in the folds may well be expected in these regions. Several small insertions in and around the HK97 F strand map to an area adjacent to the capsomer axis (Figure 3, blue circle), where the T5 pb10 protein appears to bind and for which HK97 has no analogue.

Figure 3. Modeling the T5 capsid density with capsomers of HK97. (a) A side view and (b) an oblique view of the HK97 gp5 hexamer fit into the empty T5 head reconstruction. The pb10 lump central to the T5 hexamer (arrow) has no analog in the HK97 capsid and is unoccupied, but much of the remaining density is well fit by the HK97 subunits. Differences occur at the gp5 Eloops and at the central domains (blue circles) adjacent to the pb10 binding sites, as well as the gp5 3­5 region that protrudes from the T5 capsid surface.

assembly, unlike the related phages  and P22. Instead, the capsid protein has an extensive aminoterminal -domain of 102 amino acid residues, 25% of the full-length protein, that is proteolysed after assembly of the first complete capsid form, prohead I, and that has been proposed to aid assembly. This domain has been visualized in cryoEM reconstructions of prohead I as a basket hanging beneath the capsomers on the interior of the capsid.19,26 Two regions of the -domain are strongly predicted to adopt a coiled-coil conformation.19 The search for a putative T5 gene encoding a scaffolding protein is hampered by the lack of sequence homology in these genes. Nonetheless, no obvious candidate is apparent in the region of structural genes. On the other hand, several arguments suggest that the T5 capsid might mature by a mechanism similar to that of HK97. The mature protein has a molecular mass of 32 kDa10 derived

Discussion
The capsid structure of T5 is the first reported with triangulation number t = 13 for a wild-type singlelayered virus, but several other protein shells with this architecture are well known. The structure most closely related is from phage T4, where a point mutant in the major capsid protein, gp23, results in the assembly of isometric capsids with a t = 13 lattice.17,28 These mutant capsids include the hoc and soc decoration proteins: soc binds as trimers at the periphery of the gp23 hexamers while hoc is a monomer located at the center of each hexamer, in the same location as the T5 pb10 molecule observed here. The similarity is emphasized when soc is absent from the T4 isometric capsid (Figure 5). The hoc molecule has a length of 377 amino acid residues, roughly twice that of T5 pb10 at 164 residues, and with quite different appearances in the two available T4 structures. In a personal communication, the

Figure 4. Comparison of the major capsid protein sequences: pb8 from phage T5, and gp5 from phage HK97. (a) Similar patterns of probability for coiled-coil domains are predicted in the precursor propeptides called the -domains. The sequences are aligned by the mature N termini resulting from proteolytic removal of these -domains and much of the extra length of the T5 capsid protein is evident in an N-terminal extension of this domain into which the prediction for coiled-coil also extends. (b) Sequence alignment by PSI-BLAST detected structural homology in the mature capsid protein domains, excluding the N-terminal 26 residues, with several brief gaps mostly in the HK97 sequence that account for the 17 residue deficit in length. Secondary structure for the HK97 protein21 is indicated as light-shaded arrows (-strand) and darker boxes (-helix). The HK97 crosslinking residues, K168 and N356, are marked by an X beneath them, as is a third residue, E363 that may catalyze the reaction.

authors of one study28 suggested that the hoc protein may have been proteolysed and so only the capsidbinding domain is retained. In the other, the hoc density is considerably more extensive with a bilobed appearance. In both cases, the similarity in arrangement of the T4 hoc and T5 pb10 molecules on their respective capsid surfaces is quite remarkable. We suppose that the capsid binding surface of pb10, and by analogy for hoc, is quite sensitive to the underlying capsid structure, much as antibodies are to conformational epitopes, particular amino acids must be presented in a precise spatial arrangement, as demonstrated with the hepatitis B virus capsid.29 Six sites are presented by the hexameric capsomer and we infer that they bind the accessory protein with equal affinity, since we observe no preferential arrangement of the weak linker density from the pb10 lump to the capsid. However, the binding of one molecule to a randomly selected site would sterically block access to other available sites in the same hexamer. Pentamer sites are presumably distorted by the greater local curvature of the capsid and looser packing of subunits, losing their conformational accuracy so that they are no longer recognizable for the accessory molecule to bind. The fold of the HK97 mature capsid protein21,24 has recently been observed in the capsid vertex protein, gp24, of phage T4 and is likely to be shared also by the major capsid protein, gp23.27 In addition it has been reported in phages P2230 and phi29,31 extending the range of the HK97 capsid protein fold to all families of the Caudovirales, as well as being suggested as a likely model for the lower domain "core" of herpesviruses.32 Although T5 does not

have the same capsid lattice geometry as HK97, the differences amount to the inclusion of three additional hexamers on each icosahedral facet that, conceptually at least, would not require major adjustment to the quasi-equivalent bonding environments. The successful fitting of HK97 gp5 hexamers and pentamers into the T5 capsid reconstruction suggests that T5 pb8 may also have this HK97 fold. Indeed, the T5 pb8 capsid protein sequence is more similar to HK97 gp5 than the capsid proteins of T4, phi29 and P22, and scores considerably higher in threading predictions to the mature HK97 gp5 structure (see Supplementary Data). These latter proteins include domain-sized insertions, such as the 60 residue Idomain in the T4 gp24 protein that replaces the Eloop of HK97 gp5 including one of the residues involved in the chainmail crosslinking. In comparison, the T5 density map accommodates much of the HK97 gp5 E-loop and only a six residue insertion is necessary in T5 pb8 to maintain sequence alignment. What governs assembly of the HK97 and T5 capsid proteins into capsids of different geometries? In the absence of a scaffold protein in each case, the -domain appears a likely candidate and is already implicated in assembly for HK97. The extra length of the T5 pb8 -domain correlates with the larger capsid, although the mechanism for effecting this correlation is not obvious. One assembly model proposed for HK97 is hierarchical, a pentamer in solution binds five hexamers to make a "superpenton", and 12 of these will form a t = 7 capsid,19 although no evidence bears on this either way. Such

Phage T5 is Structurally Similar to HK97 and T4

999 important in the lower concentration of capsid protein found in vivo. To test the function of the -domains in these systems, we envisage the following experiments, which we expect to report on in future. In one, expression of protease-defective T5 phage should allow isolation of T5 prohead particles that may be analyzed by cryoEM and image reconstruction to visualize the -domain for comparison with HK97 prohead I capsid. In another, construction of chimers of the two capsid proteins of T5 and HK97, involving a -domain from one phage with the mature capsid protein from the other, may lead to assembly of t = 13 HK97-gp5 particles, or t = 7 T5-pb8 particles, which would confirm the role of the -domains in assembling capsids of particular geometry. We have also examined the connector and tail structures of T5 (see Supplementary Information). Although the structural analyses are limited, nonetheless we can conclude that the density distribution of the T5 connector, which tapers along the packaging axis towards the center of the capsid, is more similar to that reported for phage T4,18 despite the latter having a contractile tail, than to the connector of phage phi29.33 The tail itself is confirmed to be a stack of 40 trimeric rings with an axial repeat of 43.8 Å, and a rotation between successive rings of 39.4°. The 3-fold symmetric nature of the tail tube is another unusual feature of T5--most known phage tails are 6-fold symmetric, and we are aware of only one other welldocumented example with this symmetry, phage phi-CbK.34,35 The tail tubes of both T5 and phiCbK are long and non-contractile, but the significance of trimeric over hexameric rings is unknown. We suppose that DNA release from the capsid is affected by some signal that traverses the long tail tube. A candidate for signal triggering is pb2, the 1219 residue oligomeric protein forming the straight tip-fiber.3 Indeed, pb2 shares common characteristics with gpH, the tape measure protein that determines the length of phage  tail.36,37 Accordingly, five or six copies of pb2 would form a partially coiled coil structure spanning the T5 tail. Upon interaction with the host pb2 would undergo large conformational changes, transmitting its signal to the connector, which responds by opening and allowing passage of the DNA through the tail. We hope to explore any structural consequences of such a signal in future experiments, as we improve resolution of our helical analyses. A second functional aspect of the tail tube is any role it may have in facilitating DNA passage, and in particular, if any such role is particular to the unique two-stage genome transport in which 8% is expelled into the host, from which pre-early phage proteins are expressed that are required for transport of the rest of the DNA.3 We propose to address these questions by building on the structural work presented here for comparison with partially empty particles that have DNA within the tail, and completely empty particles whose tails are once again devoid of DNA.

Surface renditions of the T5 capsid (blue) with the pb10 monomers highlighted (red), together with the tail and tip reconstructions (see Supplementary Data) and cartoon representations of the connector and tailfibers. The mature HK97 capsid (purple) is shown at left, and the T4 isometric soc- capsid28 (green) at right, with its hoc monomers highlighted (red). Schematics of the capsid geometries are also shown: t=7 for HK97 (purple) and t=13 for T5 and isometric T4 (green). The capsids reveal similar morphologies for the hexameric and pentameric capsomers, with HK97 having fewer hexamers and lacking the hexamer-binding accessory protein visible in the T5 and T4 isometric structures (red lumps). The bar represents 250 Å.

a model could be extended for t = 13 capsids by invoking a second ring of five hexamers around the "super-penton". The role of the connector has not been considered in this argument, since HK97 capsomers assemble into t = 7 shells in its absence in expression systems, although it is likely to be

1000 The new data on T5 reveal variations on the assembly and maturation strategies employed by viruses that augment general patterns observed in capsid design.32 Different pathways appear as if selected from a common menu of choices, yielding unique processes and structures that obscure an underlying web of evolutionary connections. We foresee continued elaboration of the structural components of the T5 phage leading to a detailed view of the action of assembly and infection including the conformational changes that are functionally significant. Structural comparisons between phages T5 and HK97 look to be particularly appealing for understanding the mechanisms that direct similar subunits towards structurally different products.

Materials and Methods
Phage T5 characteristics and purification Two mutant strains of T5 were used for this study: T5st (0) (114 kb), a heat-stable mutant deleted of 7.2% of its genome38 (NCBI Entrez ID, AY692264), and phage T5st amN5, an amber mutant derived from T5st(0) that produces empty capsids devoid of pb10 and unattached active tails.10 Phages T5st(0) and T5st amN5 were propagated on E. coli F and on the permissive host E. coli Fsu+, respectively. E. coli F was used as a non-permissive host for T5st amN5 for the production of pb10- empty capsids and active tails. Phage particles were purified by centrifugation on glycerol and/or CsCl gradients10,39 and were stored in 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.6). The final titer was 1013 phage particles/ml. Empty capsids were obtained by treating the phage with 2 M urea for 2 h at 37 °C. Observation of the treated phages by negative staining and cryoEM indicated that almost all capsids were intact and free of DNA while the tails had lost their distal part, suggesting that such treatment triggered the release of DNA through the tail. Urea was removed by dialysis prior to imaging by cryoEM. Microscopy and 3D analysis For cryo-electron microscopy, purified samples were prepared on Quantifoil grids, blotted and rapidly frozen to liquid nitrogen temperature according to standard methods. Grids were transferred to a Gatan 626 cryoholder and imaged using low-dose techniques in an FEI CM200 microscope with LaB 6 electron source and operated at 200 kV, maintaining the low temperature throughout. Fields were viewed at a nominal magnification of 38,000× and exposed twice at different defocus settings: in the first the phase contrast transfer function's first zero was at a spacing of 18 Å ­23 Å, and at 23 Å ­28 Å for the second exposure. Films were developed for 12 min in full-strength Kodak D19. Negatives were screened by optical diffraction to reject drifted or astigmatic images, and scanned on a Z/I Photoscan at 7 m scan rate, corresponding to 5.6 Å/pixel at the sample for negative-stain images and 1.8 Å/pixel for cryoEM images. Capsid images were selected with the XWindows program x3dpreprocess and the contrast

transfer functions assessed and corrected according to an established method.40 The initial negative stain data were analyzed by self-common lines41 to generate a starting model from a single particle, and this was used in a modified model-based procedure42 to determine orientations for other images, resulting in a 3D density map calculated using Fourier­Bessel methods43 to a resolution of about 35 Å. This model was used to start the solution of orientations for the cryoEM data after scaling by eye to match. Full icosahedral symmetry was imposed on the density maps, and resolution was assessed by Fourier Shell Correlation44 at the 0.3 limit. For studying the capsid­connector-tail complex, images of particles treated with 2 M urea were analyzed initially as described above. Symmetry was then reduced 12-fold by imposing a cylindrical tube of density at one vertex of the reconstruction to simulate the tail, and rotating each particle so that the tails were aligned along this common vertex, leaving only 5-fold symmetry along this capsid-tail axis. Continued refinement and reconstructions were done in this reduced-symmetry frame. The DNA-filled head reconstruction was calculated from images of 1524 particles selected from a total of 2337 collected from 25 focal pair micrographs, and the resolution estimated to be 20.3 Å. The empty heads, produced after treatment with 2 M urea, yielded a density map to 19.2 Å resolution that included 2651 images drawn from the total of 3177 images extracted from 20 focal pair micrographs. Micrographs of the T5st amN5 mutant mutant particles devoid of pb10 were sparsely populated, and a greater percentage of particles, 258 of 278, were included in calculation of the density map to reduce noise, yielding a resolution of 30.8 Å. All analyses were run on PowerMac G5 computers (Apple Computer, Cupertino CA, USA). Fitting of the HK97 gp5 hexamer and pentamer into a truncated density map focusing on the region of interest was performed on Linux workstations (Dell, Austin TX, USA) using CoLoRes of the SITUS package.45 Surface views of reconstructions were generated with Amira (Mercury Computer Systems/3D Viz group, San Diego CA, USA and Merignac, France). The molecular graphics images of Figure 3 were made with VMD46 and the inset model of the HK97 gp5 protein was produced using the UCSF Chimera package from the Computer Graphics Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco. Sequence comparison Sequence comparison was made with PSI-BLAST47 and prediction of coiled-coil was performed according to the method of Lupas et al.48 on the web site of the Pôle Bioinformatique Lyonnais ­ Network Protein Sequence Analysis§.
