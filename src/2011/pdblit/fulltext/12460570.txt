Substrate channeling between enzymes has an important role in cellular metabolism by compartmentalizing cytoplasmic synthetic processes. The bacterial tryptophan synthases are multienzyme nanomachines that catalyze the last two steps in L-tryptophan biosynthesis. The common metabolite indole is transferred from one enzyme to the other in each ab-dimeric unit ° of the a2b2 complex via an interconnecting 25-A-long tunnel. Recent solution studies of the Salmonella typhimurium a2b2 complex coupled with X-ray crystal-structure determinations of complexes with substrates, intermediates and substrate analogs have driven important breakthroughs concerning the identification of the linkages between the bi-enzyme complex structure, catalysis at the a- and b-active sites, and the allosteric regulation of substrate channeling. Channeling and tryptophan synthase Biological nanomachines couple chemical and mechanical processes to achieve biological function. The tryptophan synthase a2b2 bi-enzyme complex (Figure 1a) is an efficient nanomachine that catalyzes the final two steps in L-tryptophan (L-Trp) biosynthesis (Figure 1b,c) in bacteria, yeasts, molds and plants (Box 1). Efficiency is achieved by the direct transfer (substrate channeling; see Glossary) of the common intermediate, indole, between the active sites of ° the a- and b-subunits through a 25-A-long interconnecting tunnel. Structure­function relationships in tryptophan synthase catalysis and channeling have been investigated since the late 1950s (for reviews, see Refs [1­10]). However, a detailed understanding of the chemical and mechanical processes that regulate substrate channeling in this nanomachine has been achieved only recently [11­35]. Three recent advances concerning the catalytic mechanism and allosteric regulation of the tryptophan synthase nanomachine motivate us to write this review. Newly designed substrate analogs for the tryptophan synthase a-site (Figure 2a) have revealed important aspects of the allosteric interactions that regulate channeling [11­15]. Moreover, solution experiments have established the linkage between the physical interactions and the chemical transformations that take place at the a- and b-catalytic sites during the catalytic cycle [16­26]. Finally, X-ray crystal structures have provided new insights into both the catalytic mechanisms of the a- and b-sites, and the allosteric

interactions between regions that synchronize catalysis and regulate indole channeling [11,13­15,26­35]. These advances establish how chemical events in the a- and bcatalytic cycles choreograph the conformational events that synchronize catalysis at the two sites and prevent indole escape by switching the subunits between open and closed conformations. a-Site catalysis: site-directed mutagenesis and new IGP analogs The tryptophan synthase a-subunits catalyze the cleavage of 3-indole-D-glycerol 30 -phosphate (IGP) to yield indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) (Figure 1b). Recent mutational studies and analysis of structural elements identified residues that are important for catalysis (aAsp60 and aThr183) and residues that interact across the a­b subunit interface (aAsp56­bLys167 and aGly181­bSer178). These studies demonstrated that aAsp60 has an essential role in stabilizing charge development on the IGP indole ring during C­C bond scission [28,32­34]. Substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid in the aAsp60Asn variant, or substitution of valine for threonine in the aThr183Val variant is sufficient to destabilize this interaction, resulting in impaired catalysis at the asite and loss of allosteric communication [28,34]. Consequently, the positioning of aAsp60 in a highly ordered H-bonding network involving aThr183 is crucially important for this process [34]. The first stable a-site ligand (ASL) analog of IGP, indole 3-propanol phosphate (IPP) [36] (Figure 2a), has been extensively used in structural and mechanistic studies [4­8,27,36,37]. A series of transition-state analogs for the C­C bond scission step incorporate a sp3-hybridized C to model the proton transfer to C-3 of the indole ring [11] Glossary

In stage II, indole, produced at the a° site, is channeled to the b-site via the 25-A-long tunnel, where it reacts with E(A-A) to yield the E(Q2), E(Q3), E(Aex2) and E(GD2) intermediates.

Box 1. Tryptophan synthase, plant defense, infectious disease, and herbicides
Tryptophan synthase homologs are found in bacteria, yeasts, molds, plants and some protozoans [1]. Although this review is focused on advances in our understanding of the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the Salmonella typhimurium nanomachine, there are also interesting recent developments involving tryptophan synthase in areas related to plant defense, infectious disease and herbicide design. The benzoxazinones (BX) are secondary metabolites involved in a maize defense mechanism. Maize has an a-subunit homolog, BX1, that converts 3-indole-D-glycerol 30 -phosphate (IGP) to indole in the first step in the benzoxazinone pathway. Sequence alignment indicates that BX1 evolved from the tryptophan synthase a-subunit, and that the active sites and catalytic mechanisms of the two enzymes are similar [13]. However, BX1 cleaves IGP with an apparent kcat 1400-fold faster than the isolated tryptophan synthase a-subunit, and 14-fold faster than an a-subunit within a2b2. A comparison of active site structures [13] shows that, in contrast to the a-subunit, the BX1 catalytic groups analogous to aGlu49 and aAsp60 are locked into the correct positions for catalysis. Therefore, the lower activity of the tryptophan synthase a-subunit seems to reflect the switching between inactive and active states that is required for allosteric control. The absence of a synthetic pathway for L-tryptophan (L-Trp) in higher animals and humans makes the tryptophan synthase nanomachine a potential target both for the development of herbicides and for the design of drugs to treat infectious disease. Indeed, potent inhibitors of the tryptophan synthase a-subunit are herbicidal [11,49]. Potential infectious disease targets include Chlamydia trachomatis [50,51] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [52]. C. trachomatis is the causative agent of trachoma, the leading cause of blindness. M. tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis and is responsible for 2 million deaths annually. The parasite Cryptosporidium encodes a tryptophan synthase [53]. These genes could be derived from a eubacterial ancestor [53]. Cryptosporidium infection can cause cryptosporidiosis (watery diarrhea), a condition that can be life threatening in individuals with compromised immune systems. Consequently, understanding the molecular basis of substrate channeling and the catalytic mechanisms of the a- and b-subunits could provide useful insights for developing the tryptophan synthase nanomachine as an important target for drug design, or for the development of herbicides [11,49­53].

amide or sulfonamide linkages. These ASLs bind to the asite with high specificities and affinities, cause closure of aL6, and mimic IGP and G3P allosteric behavior [14,25,26]. Finally, the structures of the ASLs formed in the reactions of 2-aminophenol (2AP) or indoline [13,15] with G3P, 2-HGP and NGP, respectively (Figure 2a­c), indicate that these adducts are transition-state analogs for the a-reaction. a-Site catalysis: nearly perfect transition-state analogs for IGP cleavage The structures formed by soaking enzyme crystals with either 2AP or indoline and G3P to form the adducts 2-HGP and NGP, respectively (PDB codes: 1TJP [13] and 3CEP [15]) (Figure 2a­c), provided a breakthrough for understanding a-site catalysis and regulation. In addition to the structure of tryptophan synthase complexed to the IGP analog, IPP [37], the (2-HGP)­E(Ain) structure [13] and the (NGP)­E(Q)indoline structure [15] are two of the most important a-subunit complexes yet determined. These structures show the a-subunit with an essentially completely closed conformation, wherein G3P forms stable adducts with 2AP (Figure 2b,c) or indoline (Figure 2b) that mimic the transition-state for IGP cleavage [13,15]. In these adducts, the catalytic aGlu49 side-chain is wedged into a hydrophobic pocket and forms H-bonds with the analog N and with the OH of C-30 (Figure 2c). This orientation of aGlu49 corresponds to the active conformation, and supports a concerted bifunctional (push­pull) acid­base mechanism (Figure 2d), wherein C­C bond cleavage is initiated by the action of the carboxylic acid group functioning as a shuttle to transfer the hydroxyl proton at C-30 to the IGP indole ring C-3. The hydrophobic nature of the cavity formed by the side-chains of aPhe22, aLeu100, aLeu127, aTyr175 and aIle232 (Figure 2c) tolerates the carboxylic acid, while probably rejecting the carboxylate. In ASL structures where the aGlu49 carboxylate folds back and is held in an inactive conformation by a H-bond to the hydroxyl of aTyr173 (i.e. the G3P complex; Figure 2c), either the side-chain methyls of aLeu100, aLeu127 and aIle232 are too close together to accommodate the aGlu49 side-chain (typically in GP or G3P complexes) or the ASL structure forces aGlu49 to assume the folded-back conformation for steric and/or electronic reasons [11,12,14,28,34] (see also PDB code: 1QOQ). IGP-containing complexes obtained at neutral pH show two conformations for the aGlu49 side-chain: one folded away from IGP and Hbonded to aTyr173 (an apparently inactive conformation), the other folded in with the 30 OH of IGP H-bonded to both side-chain oxygens of the aGlu49 carboxylic acid [28,29]. The folded-in conformation could be an intermediate on the catalytic path. The (2-HGP)­E(Ain) structure [13] (Figure 2c) and the (NGP)­E(Q)indoline structure [15] both show aAsp60 positioned where it would stabilize the developing positive charge on the ring nitrogen of the corresponding IGP indole moiety in the physiological reaction [13,15,27,29,32­34]. b-Site catalysis and allosteric interactions The b-reaction catalyzes replacement of the L-Ser hydroxyl by indole (Figure 1c), a two-stage process. In stage I, L-Ser

(Figure 2a). These transition-state analogs exhibit high affinity for the a-site of the internal aldimine, E(Ain), and induce closed conformations with loop aL6 folded down over the active site. However, steric and/or electrostatic interactions with the analogs prevent rotation of the catalytic aGlu49 carboxylate from inactive-to-active conformations. The allosteric effects of these interesting ligands were not reported [11]. Using computer-assisted molecular modeling, IGP peptide structural mimics have been designed [12,32]. Two of these ASLs, indole 3-acetylglycine (IAG) (Figure 2a) and indole 3-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (IAA), inhibit the a-reaction. IAG and IAA are similar to complexes that are similar to IPP with the phosphoryl sub-site occupied by the ligand carboxylate, the indole ring NH H-bonded to aAsp60, and one carboxylate oxygen of the catalytic aGlu49 H-bonded to the acetyl oxygen [32]. This orientation of aGlu49 corresponds to an inactive arrangement. More recently, three new families of a-site ligands have been designed [14]. The most interesting of these ligands (F9; Figure 2a) contain aromatic groups attached to O-phosphoethanolamine via

reacts rapidly with the internal aldimine E(Ain) via an E(Ain)­(L-Ser) Michaelis complex to give gem-diamine E(GD1), external aldimine Schiff base E(Aex1), quinonoid E(Q1) and a-aminoacrylate Schiff base E(A-A) enzyme forms, and a water molecule (Figure 1c). In stage II, indole, channeled from the a-site, enters the b-site and reacts with E(A-A) to give quinonoid species E(Q2) and E(Q3), external aldimine E(Aex2), gem-diamine, E(GD2), the E(Ain) product complex, and, finally, L-Trp is released and E(Ain) is

regenerated. The sequence of C­C, C­H, C­N, C­O, N­H and O­H bonding transformations in stages I and II (Figure 1c) is mediated by the pyridoxal 50 -phosphate coenzyme (PLP) and the action of protein side-chain catalytic groups. PLP is covalently attached as the internal aldimine Schiff base E(Ain) via the e-amino group of a lysine residue (bLys87 in tryptophan synthase) (Figure 1c), a feature common to almost all PLP-requiring enzymes [1,3].

coenzyme is primed for catalysis by H-bonds and van der Waals contacts [27­37]. bLys87 further functions as a general acid­base catalytic group in proton transfers both at Ca of the external aldimine species and at the indole ring C-3 in the conversion of E(Q2) to E(Q3), and as a nucleophile in the transimination reactions to interconvert internal aldimines and external aldimines (Figure 1c). bGlu109 has two roles: general acid­base catalysis in stage I to interconvert E(Aex1) and E(A-A) via E(Q1), and charge stabilization in stage II to facilitate nucleophilic attack of indole on E(A-A) to give E(Q2). The linkage of this chemistry is key to understanding how the tryptophan synthase nanomachine works. The catalytic cycles of the a- and b-sites are synchronized through a mechanism wherein conversion of E(Aex1) to E(AA), via E(Q1) (Figure 1c), switches the a-site on, whereas conversion of E(Q3) to E(Aex2) switches the a-site off [7,38,39] (Figure 3a). This transmission of allosteric effects relies on the binding of a monovalent cation effector to the bsubunit [7,8,16­19,40,41]. When coupled with the switching of the a- and b-sites between open (inactive) and closed (active) conformations, the catalytic cycles of the a- and bsites become synchronized (Figure 3a). However, a clear understanding of the mechanism of b-site catalysis and the allosteric interactions between a- and b-sites only came about through the determination of the first two structures of the native enzyme in the closed conformation, the (GP)­ E(A-A) complex [26] and the (NGP)­E(Q)indoline complex [15], in combination with investigations of the allosteric regulation of channeling using novel kinetic and mechanistic probes [12,14,26,42]. Closed conformations of the a- and b-subunits were predicted from a variety of solution studies [7,8] and demonstrated via ligand trapping [21,22]. Until recently, nearly all of the available tryptophan synthase structures exhibited open conformations of the b-subunit with the asubunit either open (unligated), or in closed or partially closed states with bound ASLs. Pressure-jump methods [24] have enabled the determination of the distribution of the open E(Aex1) and closed E(A-A) species as a function of pressure. Open conformations are stabilized in the crystalline state [29,40]; furthermore, low temperature favors open, inactive conformations of tryptophan synthase in solution [19]. These circumstances have interfered with the determination of the structure of the wild-type enzyme in the closed conformation. The first structures containing closed b-subunit conformations were reported for the variant with catalytic lysine, bLys87, replaced by threonine [27]. This variant forms L-Ser and L-Trp external aldimines with the closed b-subunit conformation; however, because this variant is inactive, the mechanistic importance of these structures

could not be evaluated. The (GP)­E(A-A) complex [26] (Figures 1a,3b) and the (NGP)­E(Q)indoline complex [15] provided the first structures of wild-type tryptophan synthase with both the a- and b-subunits in the closed conformation. These closed structures indicate: (i) details of the b-site catalytic mechanism; (ii) structural events that trigger the switch of the b-site from the open, inactive conformation to the closed, active conformation; and (iii) new elements of the scaffolding that transmit the allosteric signal that activates the a-site. The open conformation of the b-subunit is likely to be the inactive state Structures of E(Ain)(S) or E(GD) species have not been published; however, kinetic studies show that these species, in addition to E(Aex1) and E(Aex2), have inactive a-sites, which strongly implies that the b-subunits have open conformations [7,38,43] (Figure 3a). Structures of native E(Aex1) complexes (PDB codes: 1KFE, 1KFJ, 2CLL, 2CLM and 2CLO) all have open b-subunit conformations, and all show b-site-bonding interactions that must correspond to inactive states (Figure 3b). The hydroxyl of Aex1 in these structures is folded away from ° bE109 (typically at a distance of 7 A), and secured by Hbonds to the NH of bAla112 and to the carboxylate of bAsp305 (Figure 3b). In three of the five native E(Aex1) complexes (PDB codes: 2CLL, 2CLM and 2CLO), bE109 is tethered by a H-bond to a water molecule, which is also Hbonded to the Aex1 carboxylate. These interactions work to stabilize E(Aex1) relative to E(Q1) and E(A-A) by making elimination of the hydroxyl chemically difficult and by stabilizing the open conformation. Furthermore, the bAsp305 carboxylate is not available to form the salt bridge with bArg141 and the H-bond to bSer297, interactions that are necessary for the switch to the closed conformation [26]. 15 N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (HSQC NMR) measurements have been used to investigate the conformational status of complexes with 1-15N substituted L-Trp [23]. These studies showed the L-Trp ring NH proton does not exchange rapidly (on the NMR time scale) in the E(Aex2) complex with tryptophan synthase, and that the binding of the ASLs, GP or G3P, slows the exchange. These investigators proposed that GP or G3P transmits an allosteric effect that triggers b-subunit closure in the L-Trp complexes. However, L-Trp binding does not activate IGP cleavage by the a-site [7,38], implying an open b-subunit conformation. The detected allosteric effect [23] is consistent with the structural ordering of the b-subunit observed [14,25] in complexes with open b-subunit conformations.

activity states of the a-reaction. As the b-subunit steps through the 11 chemical states, the a-site (represented by green and magenta spokes) is switched on and off via allosteric transitions that activate or deactivate the a-site by 28-fold [7,38,39]. a-Site activation is triggered when the L-Ser external aldimine, E(Aex1) is converted to the aaminoacrylate Schiff-base intermediate E(A-A). Deactivation occurs when the quinonoid species, E(Q3), is converted to the L-Trp external aldimine, E(Aex2). During the bcatalytic cycle, the binding of IGP activates the rate-determining step in stage I of the b-reaction, the conversion of E(Aex1) (red triangle) to E(A-A) via E(Q1) [26].

Red broken lines represent H-bonds. The distance between Water 88 (wat88) and C-b of E(A-A) is shown as the black broken line.

In stage I, the bGlu109 carboxylic acid group functions as the acid catalyst that protonates the hydroxyl leaving group of E(Aex1), facilitating elimination to give E(A-A). In stage II, as nucleophilic attack to form the C­C bond of E(Q2) occurs, the bGlu109 carboxylate provides a coulombic interaction to stabilize the positive charge developing on the indole N in the transition state.

bGlu109 facilitates elimination of the b-hydroxyl of the external aldimine The closed (GP)­E(A-A) structure (PDB code: 2J9X) [26] (Figures 1a,3b) fully supports a general acid catalytic function for bGlu109 in the elimination of the E(Aex1) bhydroxyl (Figure 3c). Evidence for this role derives from the positioning of a water molecule (wat88; Figure 3b) between the bGlu109 carboxylate and the a-aminoacrylate C-b. Only slight positional adjustments of the H-bonded water and the bGlu109 carboxylate seem to be needed to catalyze addition of this water to reform E(Aex1) via E(Q1). Thus, bGlu109 must also be the general acid catalyst for the reverse process, elimination of H2O by protonation of the hydroxyl leaving group. Consequently, the (GP)­E(A-A) structure provides strong evidence that conversion of E(Aex1) to E(A-A) via E(Q1) occurs within the closed conformation of the b-subunit. Thus, the open, inactive conformation of the (F9)­E(Aex1) b-subunit must switch to the closed conformation with rotation of the Aex1 hydroxyl to the new location, where it H-bonds with the bGlu109 carboxylic acid group as E(Q1) is formed. This rotation sets the stage for acid catalysis of the elimination step to give E(A-A) (compare Figure 3b with Figure 3c) by placing the Aex1 hydroxyl at essentially the same position occupied by the water H-bonded to bGlu109 in the (GP)­E(A-A) structure (wat88) (Figure 3b,c). In the closed (GP)­E(A-A) structure, the bLys87 e-NH2 seems to be poised for proton transfer to, or from, C-a. With the e-NH2 of bLys87 similarly positioned in the corresponding closed structure of E(Aex1), the site would be poised for abstraction of the C-a proton by bLys87 to give E(Q1), followed by the bGlu109 acid-catalyzed elimination of the hydroxyl to give E(A-A) and a water molecule (Figure 3c). Repositioning of the Aex1 hydroxyl seems to be driven by the conversion of the open E(Aex1) conformation to the corresponding closed conformation. This conformational change involves a displacement of the communication (COMM) domain that brings the bArg141 and bAsp305 ° a-carbons closer together by 1.3 A, moves bAla112 away ° from Aex1 by 0.8 A and flips the bAsp305 carboxylate by 1008 to form the bArg141­bAsp305 salt bridge. These changes generate a new set of H-bonds between bArg141 and bSer299, and between bAsp305 and bSer297 (Figure 3b). The interactions of bAsp305 and bAla112 with the Aex1 hydroxyl, which stabilize the open conformation of E(Aex1), are severed by these motions, enabling the hydroxyl to rotate 120­1308 into the position occupied by wat88 in the E(A-A) structure and H-bond with bGlu109 (Figure 3b). This rearrangement of site and substrate groups positions the Aex1 hydroxyl for the proton transfer needed during the elimination step. Elimination then occurs stepwise through abstraction of the E(Aex1) C-a proton by bLys87 to form E(Q)1, followed by proton transfer from bGlu109 to the hydroxyl oxygen as C­O bond scission takes place [26] (Figure 3c). bGlu109 stabilizes charges in stage II of the b-reaction Formation of the C­C bond during L-Trp synthesis occurs via nucleophilic attack of the indole C-3 on C-b of E(A-A) (Figures 1c,3c). The enamine properties of indole render C3 electron-rich, making this carbon an effective nucleo260

phile. The transition state for this nucleophilic attack requires considerable development of positive charge on the indole N. It has been hypothesized that the bGlu109 carboxylate has a crucial role in stabilizing this charge development [15,26,27,44] (Figure 3c). In support of this idea, the structure of the closed bLys87Thr variant E(Aex2) species shows the bGlu109 carboxylate H-bonded to the indolyl ring N [27]. The structure of the (NGP)­E(Q)indoline complex [15] shows that a small rotation would position the bGlu109 carboxylate next to the indoline C-3, the atom corresponding structurally to the indolyl nitrogen, supporting a charge-stabilization role for bGlu109 and strongly reinforcing the idea that the b-site chemistry occurs preferentially via the closed conformation of the b-subunit in the wild-type enzyme. Regulation of b-site catalysis by ASL binding Ngo et al. [26] hypothesize that catalysis in the b-reaction proceeds via closed structures at each step of the reaction. As conformational equilibria in stage I of the b-reaction favor the open, unreactive or less reactive states of the E(Ain)­(L-Ser) Michaelis complex, E(GD1) and E(Aex1), switching to the closed, active conformation provides a mechanism for synchronizing the activities of the a- and b-sites and preventing indole escape (Figure 3a). Formation of E(A-A) and E(Aex2), respectively, switches the a-site on and off, prevents indole escape and ensures that the a- and b-catalytic cycles occur in phase (Figure 3a). Studies with the new ASLs [14,25,26] have shown that the b-site is similarly regulated. In Stage I, the rate-limiting process is C-a­H bond scission as E(Aex1) converts to E(Q1) [26,45,46]. Ngo et al. [26] discovered that ASL binding can activate this process by as much as tenfold (Figures 3a and 4a), an allosteric transition triggered by ASL binding. The activating conformational trigger almost certainly involves switching the b-subunit from the inactive, open conformation to the active, closed conformation [26]. Transmission of the activation signal between the a- and b-sites Ngo et al. [26] hypothesized that the a- and b-subunits of the tryptophan synthase internal aldimine, gem diamine, external aldimine and quinonoid intermediates all switch between open and closed conformations during the a- and b-reaction cycles (Figures 3a,4b). The open conformations of the external aldimine and gem-diamine species do not activate the a-site. The a-reaction becomes activated only when the ab-dimeric unit is switched to the fully closed conformation with E(A-A) or E(Q) species present at the bsite [7,35,38,39] (Figures 3a,4b). The hydrophobic cavity formed by the aPhe22, aLeu100, aLeu127, aTyr175 and aIle232 side-chains (Figure 2c) also must enable rotation of the aGlu49 side-chain into the correct position to have the role of a concerted bifunctional acid­base catalyst for cleaving the IGP C­C bond (Figure 2d). The open, inactive conformation of the E(Aex1) complex is stabilized by Hbonds between bAsp305 and bAla112 and the Aex1 hydroxyl (Figure 3b). When the switch to the closed conformation occurs, these H-bonds are severed, and, as the COMM domain moves to its new position, the Aex1 hydroxyl rotates and forms an H-bond to the general acid

Figure 4. Catalysis and conformational switching. Recent analyses have identified important mechanisms for tryptophan synthase catalysis and conformational switching. (a) Rapid kinetic traces showing formation and decay of the fluorescent E(Aex1) intermediate (DF). Tight binding a-site ligands such as G3P (blue line) or F9 (red line) activate the rate-determining step in stage I of the b-reaction (the decay phase) by approximately tenfold. The green line indicates the decay rate in the absence of an ASL. (b) Cartoons depicting the relationship between (reversible) conformational switching and activation of the a-subunits (upper) and b-subunits (lower). Subunits with open and partially closed states have low catalytic activity. Only subunits with closed conformations achieve full activity.

Figure 5. Comparison of the open conformation (a and c) with the closed conformation (b and d) of the tryptophan synthase nanomachine, showing key structural differences of the a-sites, the a­b-subunit interfaces and the COMM domain. (a,c) Structural models of the open IGP­E(Ain) complex (PDB code: 1QOQ); and (b,d) the closed GP­E(A-A) complex (PDB code: 2J9X). (a,b) Structures are rendered as follows: COMM domain, blue cartoon ribbon; loop aL2, magenta; loop aL6, green; additional features of the a-subunit, yellow. IGP (yellow) and the internal aldimine (gray) are shown in sticks with O (red) and N (blue). The aGlu49 carboxylate assumes two conformations in the open structure, H-bonded to aTyr175 and H-bonded to the IGP hydroxyl. The aAsp60 carboxylate H-bonds to the IGP indole ring N. The 14 residues of Loop aL6 missing (disordered) in the open IGP­E(Ain) structure (a) are represented by green dots connecting aSer178 with aLeu193. In the closed GP­E(A-A) structure (b), only three residues of aL6 are disordered (green dots connecting residues aGly189 and aLeu193). Conversion of the open conformation (a) to the closed conformation (b) causes helix bH6 and the COMM domain to move (black arrow in a) relative to the a-subunit and in (b) results in the ordering of residues a180­a192 loop aL6, and a new set of H-bonding and van der Waals contacts among loops al6, aL2 and helix bH6. The stabilizing interactions provided by the ordering of aL6 include: van der Waals contacts between loops aL6 and aL2 (dot surfaces); H-bonds between aGly181­bSer178, aThr183­aAsp60, aAla59­bArg175, aAla59­aThr183 and aPro57­bArg175; and GP H-bonds to aGly184 and aTyr175. (c,d) The a-subunit (yellow) and b-subunit (blue) are presented as van der Waals surfaces. Helix bH6 is shown as a cartoon ribbon (brown). Loops aL2 (c,d) and aL6 (d) are rendered in cartoon and sticks (CPK coloring) surrounded by a magenta van der Waals dot surface for aL2 and a green dot surface for aL6. Except for aLeu193, aL6 is missing in (c) owing to disorder. IGP (c) and GP (d) are shown as solid van der Waals surfaces with CPK coloring. The extensive disorder of loop aL6 in the open conformation (c) indicates the a-site is highly accessible. Loop aL6 is folded down over the a-site opening onto loop aL2 in (d), giving a closed conformation with GP sequestered inside.

catalyst, bGlu109, while bAsp305 and bArg141 flip around forming a salt bridge with H-bonds to bSer297 and to bSer299, respectively (Figure 3b). These events are obligatory for switching the open, inactive conformation to the closed, active conformation of the b-subunit, which explains why substitutions in either bArg141 or bAsp305 strongly perturb b-site catalytic activity, allosteric regulation and substrate specificity [47,48]. Although the COMM domain movement is relatively large (some residues move ° relative to the a-subunit by 5 A), the global COMM domain conformation only undergoes minor changes (Figure 5a­d); however, there are a few crucial changes in the weak bonding interactions across the a­b subunit interface (Figure 5a,b). The largest differences in the COMM domain occur in the loop (residues b158 to b171) that connects bH5 with bH6 and in the first few bH6 residues. Distortion in the loop containing bArg141 provides this side-chain with different environments in the open conformation (H-bonds to bAsp138, solvent exposed) and the closed conformation (salt bridged, H-bonded, buried) (Figure 3b). Ligand binding to the a-site provides most of the driving force needed to switch the a-subunit to the closed conformation; the remainder seems to be linked to the switch of the b-subunit to the closed conformation (Figure 4). When completely closed, loop aL6 is folded down over the opening to the a-site, the carboxylate of catalytic aAsp60 is locked into the correct position for catalysis by aL6 loop residue aThr183 [27­29,34] and by aTyr102, and almost all of the loop backbone atoms exhibit well-defined electron density (Figure 5b,d). In complexes with IGP, the hydrophobic cavity apparently works against accommodation of the aGlu49 carboxylate [28]. Consequently, a general acid­ base catalytic mechanism involving the aGlu49 carboxylate seems implausible. The X-ray structures of (2-HGP)­ E(Ain) and (NGP)­E(Q)indoline [13,15] (PDB codes: 1TJP and 3CEP, respectively) (Figure 2c) are crucial for understanding a-site activation and catalysis of bond scission. The structures and chemistry of the 2-HGP and NGP adducts (Figure 2a,b) support the existence of an enzymatic path for C­C bond cleavage, wherein the carboxylic acid group shuttles a proton between the hydroxyl group and the indole C-3 of IGP in a concerted push­pull mechanism without substantial charge development on these atoms in the transition-state (Figure 2d). In GP, G3P and IGP complexes, the hydrophobic cavity is too non-polar to accommodate the aGlu49 carboxylate in the correct orientation for the concerted proton transfers (i.e. the G3P structure) [28,29] (Figure 2c). In the 2-AP and indoline adducts, this hydrophobic cavity is just large enough to enable the aGlu49 carboxylic acid group to H-bond with both the 30 -hydroxyl and the N of the adduct. The interactions between the adducts and aGlu49 are stabilized by the additional H-bond between the aniline N and aGlu49 (Figure 2c). The concerted bifunctional push­pull mechanism requires a similar alignment for the C­C bond cleavage transition state in the IGP reaction (Figure 2d).

Box 2. Outstanding questions
 What are the chemical mechanisms of the reactions catalyzed by the a- and b-sites?  What is the role of concerted, bifunctional, acid­base catalysis in the tryptophan synthase a-reaction?  How are the activities of the a- and b-sites synchronized?  What is the role of the closed conformation of the b-subunit in catalysis?  What prevents the escape of indole from tryptophan synthase?  How is channeling controlled in tryptophan synthase?

solution kinetic data with information obtained from structures of both the inactive and the active conformations of the protein. The first structures of tryptophan synthase were published in 1988 [37], providing a breakthrough regarding the understanding of substrate channeling. However, these and all subsequent structures of the native nanomachine published over the 19 years that followed correspond to inactive b-site states with the bsubunit in the open conformation. Only after considerable effort was it possible to obtain crystals with the native enzyme b-subunit in the closed state [15,26], thereby yielding the first structures with the active conformation of the b-site. Analyses of these closed structures have provided intriguing new insights that are vital for understanding the relationship between the architecture and the functioning of the bienzyme complex as a substrate-channeling nanomachine. The result presents a fascinating paradigm showing how the modulation of conformation state by ligand binding and covalent reaction synchronizes the catalytic events at the a- and b-sites to ensure the transfer of indole from one site to the other [15,26]. Although great progress has been made in mapping the substrate-channeling mechanism for tryptophan synthase, several important questions remain unanswered regarding both the chemical mechanisms of catalysis, and the transmission of allosteric effects between the subunits (Box 2). Now that structures are available for the closed ab-dimeric unit, the next challenge is to determine the protonation states of site residues and bound intermediates in these activated ab-dimeric units, and to identify the linkage of the monovalent cation effector site (MVC) and elements of the protein scaffolding that lead to activation of catalysis and allosteric regulation of channeling. The combination of new techniques in solid-state NMR with X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis seems to offer promising approaches for answering these questions.
