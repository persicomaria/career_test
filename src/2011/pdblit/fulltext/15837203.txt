CFTR is a member of the ABC (ATP binding cassette) superfamily of transporters. It is a multidomain membrane protein, which utilizes ATP to regulate the flux of its substrate through the membrane. CFTR is distinct in that it functions as a channel and it possesses a unique regulatory R domain. There has been significant progress in understanding the molecular basis for CFTR activity as an ATPase. The dimeric complex of NBD structures seen in prokaryotic ABC transporters, together with the structure of an isolated CF-NBD1, provide a unifying molecular template to model the structural basis for the ATPase activity of CFTR. The dynamic nature of the interaction between the NBDs and the R domain has been revealed in NMR studies. On the other hand, understanding the mechanisms mediating the transmission of information from the cytosolic domains to the membrane and the channel gate of CFTR remains a central challenge.

Introduction CFTR is a multidomain membrane protein of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins The CFTR protein is composed of two halves, each possessing a membrane spanning domain (MSD),1 comprised of several helical membrane segments (probably six) with intervening extracellular and intracellular loops followed by a cytosolic nucleotide binding domain (NBD). In the first half of the molecule, the putative nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) is followed by a large cytoplasmic domain called the R domain, which contains multiple serine residues that are phosphorylated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C to regulate CFTR channel function [1]. The R domain connects the first and the second half of the molecule, with the second half of the molecule comprised of the second membrane spanning domain (MSD2) and the second NBD (NBD2). In the following review, we will first discuss the structural studies of prokaryotic ABC transporter proteins which provide a template for our understanding of the nucleotide-dependent

regulation of CFTR, focusing on the conformational changes in the two nucleotide binding domains which are evoked by ATP binding and hydrolysis. We will also discuss how current prokaryotic structural models provide insight into the transmission of information from the catalytic domains to the membrane domains enabling transport through the membrane. Secondly, we will review recent progress in high-resolution structural studies of isolated domains of CFTR, focusing on their unique features. Furthermore, we will discuss how the integration of biochemical, electrophysiological and low-resolution structural studies of the intact CFTR protein permit speculations about the mechanism of action of the normal and CF disease-causing versions of this protein. Structural studies of prokaryotic ABC transporter proteins provide a template for our understanding of the nucleotide-dependent regulation of CFTR NBDs of prokaryotic ABC­NBD proteins Most of the available ABC­NBD structures solved to date are monomeric. These NBDs share a common three-dimensional fold and nucleotide binding site architecture. The NBD is divided roughly into two subdomains, termed lobes I and II [2]. The NBDs contain several conserved motifs which are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. These are the Walker A, Walker B, ABC signature motif and the Q loop and H (or Switch) loop (named respectively for glutamine and histidine residues) [2]. The N terminus of the a-helix in lobe I contains the Walker A motif. Lobe II is

mostly a-helical and contains the ABC signature motif. Both lobes are connected by a shaped b-sheet that forms an interlobe interface and contains the Walker B motif [3,4]. NBD dimers have been crystallized in several configurations (for example [2,3,5], with the head-to-tail arrangement appearing to be most consistent with biochemical evidence and structural considerations (reviewed in [6]). In the head-to-tail arrangement, each of the ATP binding sites was formed at the dimeric interface of the NBDs by juxtaposition of Walker A and B motifs of one NBD subunit and the signature motif (Walker C) of the opposing subunit. This was first revealed in the ATP-bound structure of the ATPase domain of Rad50cd, with the two ATP molecules buried in the dimeric interface [2]. This head-to-tail arrangement was subsequently observed in other NBD dimer crystals [7­11], as well as in assembled prokaryotic ABC transporter structures [11­14]. Comparison of monomeric NBD structures in various apo- or nucleotide-bound states suggests that the change of the NBD ATPase complex from a non-productive state to a productive, ATP-bound state may involve large rearrangements in the NBDs, including rotation of the a-subdomain with respect to the a/b-subdomain [7,15­ 17]. The recently published structures of HlyB have provided some structural insights into the catalytic cycle of ABC ATPases [7,8,16]. A ``dual-mode engine" was used to describe the ABC ATPase, which combines mechanical movement with generation of chemical energy [8]. The transition from a monomeric, nucleotide-free NBD state to a dimeric, ATP-bound state involves rigid-body (inward) rotation of the a-helical subdomain towards the a/b-subdomain, and a change of the conformation of the three C-terminal residues of the Walker A motif from a 310-helix to a-helix. ATP hydrolysis and inorganic phosphate release lead to NBD dimer dissociation. The finding that there was structural asymmetry within the ATP-bound HlyB dimer, interpreted to be one open and one closed inorganic phosphate exit tunnels [8], supports the idea that ATP hydrolysis is a sequential process in the NBD dimer. It was suggested the tilting of helix 6 of the HlyB NBD acts as an ``enthalpy device" that stores energy released by ATP hydrolysis, to be used for ADP release from the active site [8]. ADP dissociation results in outward rotation of the a-helical subdomain and displacement of helix 6, returning the NBD to the nucleotide-free state. Intact prokaryotic ABC transporters At present high-resolution crystal structures of six intact ABC transporters are available, all of them of bacterial origin: the vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD [12], which was also solved in complex with its periplasmic binding protein (PBP) BtuF recently [18]; the multidrug transporter Sav1866 [19]; a putative metal-chelate-type ABC transporter HI1470/71 from Haemophilus influenza [20]; the molybdate transporter ModB2C2 in complex with its cognate PBP ModA [21]; the maltose transporter MalFGK2 in complex with maltose binding protein (MBP) [14]; and the lipid transporter MsbA [22]. A couple of common themes can be gleaned from these structures despite the apparent diversity seen particularly in the MSD architecture: (1) a conservation of the NBD dimer interface and (2) interaction between the MSDs and NBDs (the transmission interface) share common features. Conformational changes in the two nucleotide binding domains which are evoked by ATP binding and hydrolysis The head-to-tail configuration of the NBD dimers seen in these assembled ABC transporters is in good agreement with that observed in isolated NBD dimers [2,9,11], with the Walker A motif of one NBD subunit juxtaposed to the ABC signature sequence of the other subunit, forming two nucleotide binding sites at the dimer interface. Interestingly, the newly published structures of MsbA show the transporter in two different conformations in absence of nucleotide binding [22]. One of the apo structures has a V-shaped

open conformation, in which the NBDs are approximately 50 Å apart, but with the nucleotide binding half-sites from each NBD still facing each other; the other apo structure is a closed conformation with the NBDs closer together with the opposing P-loops next to each other. The authors suggest a transport mechanism which requires large conformational transition of the MSDs from the open-apo conformation to the closed apo conformation to the nucleotide-bound ATP sandwich outward-facing structure. However, this open conformation with widely separated NBDs has not been observed in the other intact ABC transporter structures with or without bound nucleotides or analogs, which suggest the changes in the NBD interface during the transport cycle are likely to be more subtle. Transmission of information from the catalytic domains to the membrane domains enabling transport through the membrane Despite the limited sequence similarity and dissimilar organization of the transmembrane helices in the crystal structures of the ABC transporters, the features of the MSD­NBD interfaces appear to be of common configuration, consisting of intracellular loops from the MSD containing short helices (``coupling helices") interacting with a groove in the NBD. The details of the MSD architecture (number of TM helices and arrangement of individual helices) and MSD­NBD interface in the solved ABC transporter structures show a diversity that reflects the wide range of substrates varying in size, shape and hydrophobicity that necessitate such variation. The structure of Sav1866 clearly shows intracellular loops (ICLs) of the MSDs that contact the opposing NBD subunit. ICL1 of Sav1866 contacts its own NBD as well as the opposing NBD, whereas ICL2 contacts the opposing NBD only [19]. The various conformations of MsbA also show similar arrangement [22]. In ModB2C2A some crossing over of domains (N-terminus of ModB positioned close to outer face of ModC) was observed but not at the ``coupling helices" [21,23]. The structures of BtuCD [12], HI1470/71 [20], MalFGK2-MBP [14] show no such ``cross-over", although the MalFGK2-MBP structure features TM helices from one MSD subunit intertwining with helices from the other subunit, similar to the ModB2C2A and Sav1866 structures. From these currently available crystal structures of ABC transporters, it appears that the criss-cross of coupling helix from one MSD subunit to the opposing NBD is an exclusive feature of exporters (Sav1866 and MsbA). If this is indeed the case, whether this reflects any differences in transport mechanisms between the ABC importers and exporters is an interesting question. Indeed, the new MsbA structures raise this possibility. The V-shaped open-apo form, if real, may be required for the lateral entry of lipid substrates from the inner leaflet into the MSD [22]. The intertwined MSD­NBD interface may be required to stabilize the MsbA dimer in the open-apo conformation. One can envision a similar mechanism for Sav1866, which transports hydrophobic drug molecules. ABC importers operate by a different mode, where a PBP binds and delivers its substrate to the periplasmic side of the MSDs, thus not requiring lateral opening of the MSD dimer to accommodate the substrate. On the other hand, intertwining of TM helices from the two MSDs to form ``mixed" helical bundles is found in some of the ABC importer structures (ModB2C2A and MBP-MalFGK2) and both available exporter structures. These mixed helical bundles may also provide stabilization of the two MSD subunits and may play a role in conformational changes during the transport cycle. Although the varied MSD architecture suggests different movements may be required to open or close the translocation pathway of importers and exporters, the coupling mechanism between ATP binding/release and substrate transport may be common, such as one suggested by Locher and colleagues, in which a similar structure can mediate both importer and exporter mechanisms [13,24]. In this model, binding of ATP to NBDs results in outward-facing conformation of the MSD, allowing importers to

accept transport substrates from their respective PBPs, and exporters to release transport substrates to the periplasm. Release of the nucleotide hydrolysis product causes an inward-facing conformation, allowing in release of substrate by importers to the cytoplasm and exporters to take on new substrates. High-resolution structures of ABC transporters determined at different stages of the transport cycle are starting to emerge and should help to elucidate the transport mechanism. Progress in structural studies of intact eukaryotic ABC proteins by electron crystallography Recently several low-resolution structures of full length eukaryotic ABC transporters have been determined. The first 3D structure of an ABC protein (at 8 Å-resolution) was determined for P-glycoprotein by Rosenberg and colleagues allowing detection of the orientation of helices within the membrane domain of the intact transporter as well as the relative orientation of the NBDs [25]. As predicted, 12 cylindrical densities, orientated in two symmetrical bundles (corresponding to MSD1 and MSD2) were observed and these densities could be modeled as a-helices within and extending beyond the membrane (similar to that observed in MsbA and Sav1866). The helical extensions connect with the nucleotide binding domains. Interestingly, results from cysteine cross-linking experiments suggest that in Pglycoprotein, intracellular loop 4 from MSD2 is close to NBD1, reminiscent of the domain criss-cross in Sav1866 [26].These findings concerning P-glycoprotein and other ABC proteins, including MRP1 [25] support the utility of prokaryotic protein structures in developing structural models of the eukaryotic family members. CFTR In the following paragraphs, we will discuss the ATP-dependent functional properties of CFTR, its ATPase activity and nucleotidedependent channel gating function. Further, the insights regarding the molecular basis for these functions will be described. Finally, the future challenges to be faced in understanding the mechanism of action will be discussed. Biochemical studies of the enzymatic activity of CFTR reveal similarities and differences between CFTR and prokaryotic proteins ATPase activity As in the case of other ABC proteins, CFTR functions as an ATPase, albeit with a very low turnover rate of 1­2 ATP molecules per second [27­30]. This low level of activity is consistent with its putative role as a molecular switch in regulating the slow burstlike gating of the CFTR channel, an activity which also exhibits slow kinetics [31]. Interestingly, two research groups have recently shown that in isolation, the NBDs of CFTR exhibit adenylate kinase activity, an activity which mediates the reaction: ATP + AMP M 2ADP [32,33]. We also showed that in isolation, each of the two NBDs of CFTR exhibit adenylate kinase activity but following their co-expression and co-purification, ATPase activity increased relative to kinase activity for the complex. Most importantly, the full length, intact CFTR protein exhibited ATPase activity exclusively [34]. Clearly, as expected for an ABC protein, the ATPase activity of CFTR does require interaction between the two nucleotide binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2. Furthermore, evidence exists which suggests that the catalytic activity of the NBD1 + 2 complex is probably modified by interactions between the NBDs, and other domains, including the membrane domains and/or the R domain. For example, inhibitors which function to bind to the membrane domains to block the chloride channel pore also decrease intrinsic ATPase activity [35].

Asymmetry of the nucleotide binding domains The molecular basis for ATPase activity of CFTR remains unknown, but is likely to be conferred by the heterodimerization of its two nucleotide binding domains (CF-NBDs) in a head-to-tail orientation as for prokaryotic ABC­NBD proteins [2,13,14,20,36,37]. Such a dimer of CF-NBDs confers two nucleotide binding sites at the dimer interface. Interestingly however, alignment with related ABC family members and biochemical (8-azido-ATP labeling) studies suggest that only one of these sites is catalytically active (Fig. 1) [38]. A glutamate residue, proximal to the Walker B motif and thought to form the catalytic base in other family members [3,39], is conserved in only one of the two CF-NBDs; NBD2 (i.e. E1371). According to models based on the prokaryotic ABC protein structures, including MJ0796 [3], E1371 in NBD2 of CFTR confers the catalytic base necessary for hydrolysis at an ATP binding site comprised by the Walker A motif on the same domain and the signature (LSGG551Q) motif conferred by NBD1. The CF disease-causing mutant, G551D-CFTR, disrupts the signature motif of the catalytic site and as expected, exhibits defective ATPase activity [30]. Interestingly, the ATPase activity of CFTR is not completely inhibited by mutating the putative catalytic base, E1371. We recently determined that the mutant E1371Q-CFTR retained approximately 30% of the wild type activity [34]. A similar, partial effect of the E­Q substitution on ATPase activity has been cited for certain ABC proteins, including HlyB [7,8,40] and GlcV [41], but not for others including MJ0796 [3] and P-glycoprotein [39]. Therefore, the function of this glutamic acid residue in the ATPase activity of CFTR and perhaps other ABC proteins remains somewhat unclear. Structural studies of CFTR-NBD1 To date, we only have high-resolution structural data for NBD1. Lewis et al. have modeled the structure of monomeric mouse (m) and human (h) CFTR NBD1 from X-ray crystal diffraction data [42,43]. Overall, the core tertiary structure CFTR NBD1 is similar to other ABC transporters, NBDs. However, it differs from typical ABC domains in having two major insertional regions. The first insertion termed the regulatory insertion (RI) is comprised of two short a-helices (H1b and H1c) separated by a flexible linker region between b-strands S1 and S2. In addition to the RI, CFTR NBD1 also includes a long a-helix (H9B) termed regulatory extension (RE) that is not present in other ABC­NBD domain structures and likely corresponds to the amino terminus of another domain, the R domain. The RI and the RE exist in different orientations in the crystal structures of the mouse and human proteins, pointing to their inherent flexibility. The role of these two regions in the function of CFTR has yet to be determined. Lewis et al. created a model of an NBD1­NBD2 heterodimer by docking the mNBD1 structure and a homology model of NBD2 on to the only available dimeric structure of the E171Q mutant MJ0796 homodimer [42]. However, in this heterodimeric model, there are severe main chain steric clashes between NBD1 and NBD2, where the C-terminal a-helix H9b of mNBD1 is thrust directly into the opposing NBD2 [42]. These authors suggest there are several ways this conflict may be resolved possibly through a conformational change in NBD1 upon interdomain interaction or through displacement of clashing segments upon phosphorylation of the RI and/or RE regions [42]. This putative mechanism for interdomain interaction was supported in more recent studies, wherein a homodimer of hNBD1 lacking the RI and RE regions was crystallized (Fig. 1B). This structure supports the idea that these regions normally function to modify the stability of the NBD dimer interface. Lewis et al. also investigated the effect of deletion of F508, the major CF mutant on hNBD1 folding [43]. The construct generated had several mutations to increase solubility of the domain

Site A is thought to form the catalytic site and comprises the conserved signature motif of NBD1 (C), the conserved Walker A and B motifs and switch (H), indicated in blue. Site B is thought to function as a non-catalytic site and is comprised of sites with sequence degeneracy (indicated in red). For example, the histidine of the switch is a serine residue in Site B.

(F409L, F429S, F433L, G550E, R553Q, R555K, H667R) in addition to the deletion of F508. Interestingly, these solubilizing mutations have been shown to induce changes in DF508 hNBD1 when studied in the context of the full length protein [44]. With this caveat in mind, the overall conformation of the modified DF508 hNBD1 protein is very similar when compared to wild type-hNBD1, with a calculated rmsd of 0.51 Å [43]. The crystal structure of the DF508 hNBD1 reveals that the deletion of F508 is accommodated by shortening of the loop region between H3 and H4, and this may account for the change in surface topology near the DF508 mutation site located in a region presumed to bind to MSD1 [43]. These findings support the idea that the retention of DF508 may be caused by perturbation of communication between MSD1 and NBD1 [45] or NBD1 with the C-terminal half of CFTR [46]. Structural studies of the interaction between the R domain and NBD1 The functional R domain likely extends from residue 646 to residue 835 of CFTR [1,43,47,48]. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the R domain is essential for nucleotide-dependent gating by CFTR, therefore it has been proposed that this domain interacts with other domains to coordinate their function. Indeed, recent structural studies support the idea that there are multiple interactions between the intrinsically disordered R domain and other regions of CFTR, including the amino terminus and the NBDs [49]. NMR 1 H­15N was conducted on the isolated R domain in the presence of unlabeled NBD1 in order to define interdomain interactions. Baker and colleagues compared mobility restrictions of each R domain residue in the presence and absence of NBD1. Using this method of analysis, many sites were identified as sites structurally contacting NBD1 [49]. Furthermore, upon phosphorylation, there was a significant overall decrease in restriction of motion, suggesting the R domain loses much of its contact with NDB1 upon phosphorylation. These results support a model of CFTR regulation by phosphorylation whereby the non-phosphorylated R domain acts to block the formation of an NBD1­NBD2 heterodimer. Phosphorylation reduces a-helical properties of the R domain, there by reducing contact with NBD1, allowing for NBD heterodimerization. Electrophysiological studies of the role of nucleotides in channel gating There have been many informative studies of nucleotidedependent gating of CFTR [50­52] and a general scheme has been discussed in recent reviews [52­54]. According to this scheme, opening of the CFTR channel gate is regulated by ATP binding and/or events secondary to ATP binding. Secondly, the rate of closure of the channel gate is linked (directly or indirectly) to ATPase activity. For example, mutations of residues in the catalytic site (Site A, Fig. 1) that decrease ATPase activity, such as mutation of the Walker A lysine residue in NBD2 (K1250A) [29] and mutation

of the putative catalytic base: E1371Q leads to a decrease in the rate of channel closing [51,52,55]. This model resembles the ``ATP Switch" model proposed by Higgins and Linton for ABC proteins in general, wherein the power stroke associated transporter function and substrate translocation is conferred by nucleotide binding and induction of a ``tight" nucleotide dimer [56]. Subsequent nucleotide hydrolysis ``opens" the nucleotide dimer and results in restoration of the basal conformation of the membrane domains. The gating schemes described by Aleksandrov et al. [50] and Vergani et al. [53] suggest that nucleotide-dependent channel opening by CFTR requires nucleotide occupancy at both sites (Site A and B, Fig. 1) with hydrolysis at Site A acting to reset the gate to the closed conductance state. On the other hand, Powe and Zhou et al., suggest that ATP binding to Site A alone is required for channel opening and further, that the two Sites (A and B) serve different roles in gating [51,55]. This latter concept is supported by the idea that disruption of the signature motifs in each site, G551D (Site A) and G1349D (Site B) led to differential consequences in gating. The Site A mutant: G551D completely lacked ATP-dependent opening (and ADP-dependent inhibition) whereas the Site B mutant: G1349D exhibited only partially reduced nucleotide-dependent opening. The partial consequences of G1349D on gating suggest a possible role of Site B in modulating the activity of Site A. In support of this idea, an ATP analogue was shown to potentiate defective gating by the G551D-CFTR by binding to Site B [57]. Furthermore, regulation of nucleotide-dependent gating may be conferred through other regions in the NBDs other than the active sites. For example, the results of single channel studies on mutant channels support a possible role of the unique RI region (Fig. 1) in regulating nucleotide-dependent gating. Electrophysiological studies of nucleotide-dependent changes in pore vestibules Despite progress in understanding the structure and function of the nucleotide binding domains and the R domain, the molecular basis for converting their function into opening and closing the channel is poorly understood. Electrophysiological studies have revealed features of the chloride channel pore of CFTR, namely, its chloride selectivity filter and there are several excellent studies in this area [58,59]. Recent progress in understanding the activation-dependent changes in the membrane domains of CFTR will be briefly discussed in the following paragraphs. Recently, Linsdell and colleagues have shown that there are state-dependent changes in the structural properties of the pore [60] which likely affects the exposure of these charged residues and the accessibility of the pore to anion flux. In this study, pore-lining residues on transmembrane helix 6 substituted with cysteine were differentially modified with sulphydryl reagents

bearing either a positive or negative charge in a state-dependent manner. The authors found that negatively charged reagents, but not positively charged reagents were effectively excluded from the pore of CFTR prior to activation by PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Following phosphorylation-dependent activation, the negatively charged reagent MTSES becomes accessible and reacts with residues along the path of the pore. ATP-dependent channel gating by the phosphorylated CFTR channel is associated with more subtle changes in sulphydryl reagent accessibility, irrespective of the charge on the reagent. Another study also found state-dependent changes in cysteine accessibility in transmembrane helix 6 upon ATP binding [61]. As the authors point out, this change in accessibility upon phosphorylation and ATP interaction points to a comprehensive conformation change extending from the cytosolic R and NBD domains to the pore vestibule. However, to date, such studies of activation-dependent changes in the pore have been limited to one of 12 transmembrane segments so we still have much to learn about the molecular basis for gating of CFTR.

Future challenges Molecular basis of CFTR-ATPase activity To date, the high-resolution structural studies of NBD1 of CFTR highlight the similarities and differences with the prokaryotic proteins. The head­tail NBD interface conserved in prokaryotic ABC proteins is likely to be conserved in the CFTR protein. However, structural studies of NBD2 of CFTR and the NBD1­NBD2 heterodimer are required to support this model. On the other hand, the role for the unique regulatory regions in NBD1, including the flexible regulatory insertion and extension in ATPase activity remains to be determined. These latter studies will require analyses in the context of the full length protein. Transmission interface between the NBDs and the membrane domains Our understanding of the molecular basis for information transmission from the NBDs to the membrane domains of CFTR is limited. Prokaryotic ABC protein structures show that the interface is conserved in that helical segments, known as ``coupling helices" extending from the membrane domains interact with a groove in the NBDs [24]. Further, ATP-dependent changes in the association of the two NBDs cause a change in the position of the coupling helices relative to the membrane domains [14,24]. In Fig. 2A, we show a simple model for the possible ATP-dependent conformational changes in CFTR. This model is consistent with several ABC protein structures wherein, ATP binding to both binding sites on the NBDs causes pinching of the coupling helices, closer to one another and opening of the outer vestibule of the membrane spanning. Although the R domain is not shown in this picture, it is understood that this domain has undergone a phosphorylation-dependent change which is permissive to ATP-dependent gating. The recent cysteine substitution studies by Linsdell and colleagues support this concept wherein the outer vestibule becomes more accessible, at least to anions, during phosphorylation-dependent activation [60]. However, much of the model shown in Fig. 2 is based on pure speculation, as it is not known if the coupling helices from MSD1 or MSD2 of CFTR interact with NBD1, NBD2 or both, in a linear or cross over fashion. Finally, the consequences of conformational changes at the NBDs and coupling helices for the structure of the pore region remain to be determined. As phosphorylation of the R domain also induces changes in the structure of the membrane domain [60] it will be important to

(Left) Model of normal CFTR suggests that ATP binding induces formation of tight NBD1­NBD2 dimer and lateral translocation of the coupling helices, shown as coils.

map interactions between the R domain and the membrane domains, and possibly the coupling helices in particular, in order to understand the role for this post-translational modification in regulated gating. Understanding the molecular basis for disease in the case of the common CF-causing mutations; DF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR The crystal structure of the DF508 hNBD1 reveals that the deletion of F508 causes a change in surface topology near the DF508 mutation site [43] supporting the idea that this mutant lacks proper domain­domain interactions and is misassembled [46]. The domain interactions which are perturbed for this mutant have yet to be determined and could include interaction between NBD1 and the membrane domains, NBD2 and the R domain. The crystal structure of the NBD1 homodimer (Fig. 1) showed that the G551 residue within the signature motif does interact with ATP at the NBD1­NBD1 interface, suggesting that the disease-causing mutation G551D will disrupt normal nucleotide binding and interactions at the domain interface (pdb:2pze). Hypothetically, disruption of this interface will lead to defective channel gating as effective NBD dimerization will be impaired and the mechanical driving force for opening of the channel gate-disrupted (Fig. 2). However, a structure of the heterodimer structure of CF-NBD1­NBD2 is essential in order to support such speculation. Clearly, our understanding of the molecular basis for

disease in the case of these CF-causing mutations requires a structural map of the native intramolecular interactions in the full length protein. Progress in structural studies of intact CFTR by electron crystallography Rosenberg and colleagues solved a low-resolution structure of CFTR by electron crystallography of negatively stained two-dimensional crystals [62]. The same research group conducted single particle analyses [63] and together, these structural studies support an overall structure for CFTR which resembles the prokaryotic protein, MsbA. Interestingly, the two-dimensional crystal studies of CFTR in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue: MgAMP-PNP, reported two quite distinct conformations which the authors ascribe to the nucleotide-bound and unbound states. These advances in structural studies of intact CFTR promise a future in which we will eventually have high-resolution models with which to determine the molecular mechanisms of activity.
