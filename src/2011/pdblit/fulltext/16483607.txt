The mammalian extracellular ADP-ribosyl transferases ART1 through ART5 are sequence-related to each other. Among them ART2 is involved in immuno regulation. The variant ART2.2 was expressed in the periplasm of Escherichia coli and crystallized. Its structure was determined by ° X-ray diffraction at 1.7 A resolution in one crystal form and at slightly lower resolutions in two others. The active center was indicated by a ligated nicotinamide analogue, which also revealed a small induced-fit. The centerpiece of the chainfold of ART2.2 agrees with those of all bacterial ADP-ribosyl transferases. This correspondence and the nicotinamide position were used to model the binding structure of the whole substrate NADþ at ART2.2. Two of the bacterial enzymes are structurally more closely related to ART2.2 while the others are more closely related to the eukaryotic poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase. This splits the ADP-ribosyl transferases into two distinct subfamilies. A special feature of ART2.2 is its long N-terminal extension and two disulfide bridges that are far away from the active center. They stabilize the protein against denaturation and presumably also against shearing forces parallel with the membrane where ART2.2 is anchored.

Introduction
ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTs) belong to a group of enzymes that use NADþ as a substrate rather than as a coenzyme.1 ­ 3 These enzymes transfer the ADP-ribose moiety onto specific targets while the efficient leaving group nicotinamide is released. Most known ARTs ADP-ribosylate proteins, e.g. at Arg, Cys, Asn or Glu residues. Like protein phosphorylation, protein ADP-ribosylation is reversible and is used for functional regulation. Some ARTs transfer ADP-ribose onto non-protein targets including DNA, amino acids, ADP-ribose and water.

The enzyme family attracted attention because it contains the virulence factors of various prokaryotic pathogens that pose significant human health threats.2,4 Upon translocation into mammalian cells, the bacterial ARTs function as toxins that ADP-ribosylate and inactivate key targets, e.g. heterotrimeric G-proteins, ras, rho, actin and elongation factor 2. However, ART activity has also been detected in the extracellular space of uninfected mammalian tissues.1,3 Several mammalian ecto-ARTs have been cloned, including the four glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins ART1 through ART4 and the secretory protein ART5.3,5 All of them are closely sequence-related, implying that they assume very similar structures. Until now, seven prokaryotic toxic ADP-ribosylating enzymes and a related eukaryotic poly(ADPribosyl)polymerase (PARP) have been structurally elucidated.4,6,7 The structures revealed a conserved active center containing a critical glutamate8 but otherwise rather relaxed sequence requirements. Bacterial toxin ARTs exhibit less than 10% amino acid sequence identity when compared with

mammalian ecto-ARTs, but sequence fingerprints indicated that their active centers resemble each other.9,10 The physiological functions of mammalian ectoARTs are still ill-defined. ART1 and ART2 have been found to ADP-ribosylate a number of extracellular target proteins including cell surface proteins, e.g. integrins a7b1 and aLb2, CD8, CD44 and growth factor PDGF-B.11 ­ 13 ART1 has been implicated to play a role in the differentiation of skeletal muscle and in neutrophil migration.14,15 ART2 can trigger T-cell apoptosis.16,17 Studies of the BB rat model of type I diabetes suggest that ARTs may mediate important immunoregulatory functions in the control of this T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease.18 Rat ART2.2 displays NADþ glycohydrolase and auto-ADP-ribosylation activities.19,20 It is the only non-glycosylated mammalian ecto-ART and it contains merely four cysteine residues rather than the six of other ecto-ARTs.3,21 The N and C-terminal amino acids of native mature rat ART2.2 have been determined.22 The polypeptide of the mature enzyme was produced in sufficient amounts using an Escherichia coli periplasmic expression system and crystallized.23 Here we report the first structure of a mammalian ecto-ART. It characterizes the whole sequence-related vertebrate ecto-ART family and establishes a structural relationship to the bacterial toxins.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination The gene corresponding to mature ART2.2 was expressed into the periplasm of E. coli with yields of about 0.2 mg per liter culture.23 The mature enzyme contains 226 amino acid residues including two disulfide bridges with an Mr of 26,028. Compared to native ecto-ART2.2 it lacks only the GPI anchor attached to the C-terminal amino acid

residue. The protein was crystallized in three different crystal forms permitting X-ray data ° collection out to 1.7 A resolution as specified in Table 1. The structure elucidation was initialized by a mercury derivative obtained in crystal form A (Table 1), the difference Patterson function of which was clearly interpretable in terms of two sites. Later it turned out that these two sites were at the His106 side-chains of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. His106 is located in the protein interior in a non-polar environment. Further sites were identified during heavy-atom parameter refinement. The derivative was used for initial phasing including the anomalous scattering contribution. The resulting electron density map allowed us to establish the non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). Subsequently, the phases were refined and extended using the NCS and density modification. ° The procedure resulted in an interpretable 2.5 A resolution map which gave rise to an initial ART2.2 model. This model was refined, extending the resolution ° to 1.7 A and adding a glycerol and numerous water molecules. The resulting structure is of reasonable quality, the refinement parameters are given in Table 2. A ribbon representation of the structure together with a demonstration of the quality of the final electron density map is shown in Figure 1. The N-terminal half of the protein is a-helical while the C-terminal half consists of an extended mixed b-sheet with only one short ahelix. The two disulfide bridges fasten the C terminus and the central part of the b-sheet, respectively. The tightening of the C terminus appears necessary because it carries the GPI-anchor attaching the protein to the membrane. The N terminus is fixed by a b-sheet interaction. The established model was then used to solve the structures of the two other crystal forms B and C by molecular replacement. Refinement data of these forms are included in Table 2. The crystal habits of forms A and B were virtually

In crystal forms A and B both respective molecules I (continuous line) and II (dotted line) are given. The secondary structures allow a visualization of the mobile regions in Figure 1(a). The low mobility around position 60 in form C is caused by a packing contact.

indistinguishable. The analyzed form B crystal had been soaked with the product analogue 5-bromonicotinamide (BNA). BNA was bound to each of the two ART2.2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, indicating the active center (Figure 1(a)). Both BNA-binding sites coincided with those of glycerol in the ART2.2 molecules of crystal form A where glycerol was obviously picked up from the cryo protectant. The differences between the five crystallographically independent ART2.2 molecules in the three crystal forms were slight, the rmsd Ca values were ° around 0.4 A. Accordingly, no large relative domain movement is to be expected during enzymatic catalysis, because domain flexibility would have most likely manifested itself in variances among the five molecules suspended in different packing contacts. The main chain mobility of the five independent ART2.2 molecules is depicted in Figure 2. The secondary structure assignment given in this Figure relates these mobilities to the ribbon model of Figure 1(a). Mobility variations between the molecules are due to packing differences. There are seven regions of elevated mobility around residues 60, 95, 117, 136, 158, 183 and 206, all of which are in loops at the protein surface. They indicate the soft points of the protein. Among them the loops around positions 158 and 183 are close to the active center and are likely to contact putative target molecules.

The ART family It has been suggested that the active centers of the eukaryotic ART1 through ART5 are structurally related to those of their prokaryotic counterparts,9,24 which are listed in Table 3. Now, the structure of ART2.2 establishes this relationship. The whole family is characterized by a common structure of the central part of the b-sheet, the "four-stranded b-core". In ART2.2 this core comprises the strands b2, b5, b6 and b8 at the nicotinamide-binding site and is marked in Figure 1(a). In all family members this core extends into a cleft which, in several cases, has been established to bind NADþ. The conservation of this central part indicates that all ARTs have a common ancestor. A closer inspection reveals that the chain fold of ART2.2 corresponds to that of the bacterial toxins VIP2C25 and C3.7 A structure-based sequence alignment of these proteins is given in Figure 3(a). The chain fold of this group, however, differs from those of all other family members (Table 3) with respect to the b-sheet topology. In particular, strand b10 of ART2.2 (Figure 1(a)) and the equivalent b-strands of VIP2C and exotoxin C3 run parallel with strand b6 of the four-stranded b-core, whereas in all other ARTs strands b10 and b6 are anti-parallel. This difference is illustrated in Figure 3(b).

(a) Structure-based sequence alignment of the eukaryotic ART2.2 (residues 1 ­ 3 without defined conformation) with the enzymatically active domain VIP2C from Bacillus cereus25 and exotoxin C3 from Clostridium botulinum,7 that form one subfamily. Furthermore, the Figure shows those segments of exotoxin A from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ETA)36 and of chicken PARP6 ° from the other subfamily which superimpose ART2.2 within the usual 3 A cut-off criterion. The a-helices and b-strands of ART2.2 are given for reference. Every tenth residue of ART2.2 is marked (·). Residues conserved within ° the ART2.2, VIP2C and C3 subfamily are labeled (p ). Underscores indicate an alignment within 3 A between ART2.2 on one hand and any one of the other structures on the other. Apart from the N and C-terminal ends, the remaining segments have been sequence-aligned using program CLUSTALW. The marks (#) in the ETA and PARP sequences represent omitted residues. (b) Topology sketch of the central part of the b-sheets of the two subfamilies which are represented by the two eukaryotic ART structures. All numbers are from ART2.2, the central core consists of strands b2, b5, b6 and b8. Squares mean that the strands run toward the viewer, double squares run away from the viewer. The circle at the center indicates that b2 forms only a short contact with b5, the strand directions are nearly perpendicular to each other (Figure 4). The two subfamilies differ from each other with respect to the direction of the sixth strand at the left-hand side of each drawing, which is b10 in ART2.2.

The close relationship between ART2.2, VIP2C and C3 is demonstrated by the fact that their chain folds superimpose much better than combinations involving any of the other enzymes. The structural alignments of ART2.2 with VIP2C and of ART2.2 with exotoxin C3 resulted in 118 and ° 112 equivalences within the common 3 A cutoff, respectively. As shown in Figure 3(a), this alignment comprises most of the chain fold apart from the N and C-terminal segments and from insertions after b3 and in several further loops. From a structural point of view this group also contains the enzymatically inactive sister domain of VIP2C (the N-terminal domain of VIP2, Table 3) and an inactive central domain of the Anthrax lethal factor,26 neither of which has been considered here. In contrast to the 118 and 112 equivalences within the ART2.2 group, a structural comparison

of this group with the other bacterial toxins and the other eukaryotic enzyme PARP showed only about 50 equivalences (49 with ETA and 52 with PARP) as depicted in Figure 3(a). We conclude therefore that the ARTs split into two distinct structural subfamilies, one of which consists of the eukaryotic ART2.2 as well as the prokaryotic VIP2C and C3, whereas the other comprises the eukaryotic PARP and the other bacterial toxins of Table 3. The two structurally known eukaryotic ARTs belong to different subfamilies and have therefore evolved along different lines from the common ancestor. The four-stranded b-core common to the whole family (Figure 1(a)) was used for a superposition of the active centers shown in Figure 4. Here, the nicotinamide analogue bound to PARP almost exactly fits the BNA molecule bound to ART2.2.

Superposition of the eukaryotic ART2.2 on one hand (black and gray) with the bacterial VIP2C (yellow, atom colors),25 the bacterial exotoxin A (green),37 the diphtheria toxin (blue),38 and chicken polymerase (red)6 on the other. The superpositions are on the basis of the Ca atoms of the depicted structurally conserved 25 residues at the active center, which we have named four-stranded b-core (Figure 1(a)). They comprise members of both subfamilies. The strictly conserved glutamate is shown. The residue numbers are from ART2.2. The superposition relates the ligands BNA of ART2.2, NADþ of VIP2C, the NADþ analogue of ETA, NADþ of diphtheria toxin and the nicotinamide analogue of the polymerase to each other.

Moreover, both of them superimpose on the nicotinamide moiety of NADþ bound to VIP2C and to diphtheria toxin as well as on the thiazolamide moiety of the NADþ analogue bound to ETA. Accordingly, Figure 4 clarifies the location of the active center of ART2.2 and suggests how NADþ is bound to this enzyme. It demonstrates further that the binding modes of the ADP moieties of NADþ differ appreciably when comparing VIP2C with ETA and diphtheria toxin. Since ART2.2 belongs to the same subfamily as VIP2C we use the NADþ conformation in VIP2C in the following analysis of ART2.2.

The main structural differences within the ART2.2 subfamily occur at the N terminus where ART2.2 has 65 additional residues wound around the surface of the common molecular core, away from the active center and away from the

a The enzyme VIP2 consists of two structurally closely homologous domains among which only the C-terminal domain, here named VIP2C, shows enzymatic activity and is considered in Results and Discussion. A further structurally homologous chainfold occurs as a central domain of the Anthrax lethal factor.26 It belongs to the structural subfamily defined by ART2.2, VIP2C and exotoxin C3, but has no catalytic activity and is therefore not used in the superpositions.

The N and C-terminal polypeptide segments, which are not present in the closest bacterial homologues VIP2C and exotoxin C3, are drawn as stippled lines. The depicted disulfide bridge and the N and C-terminal additions with respect to the bacterial toxins are probably designed to resist shear forces likely to occur along the membrane in rough extracellular environments. Note that the enzyme is viewed essentially upside down when compared to Figures 1(a), 4, 6 and 7.

additional N-terminal a-helix of VIP2C and exotoxin C3. This difference is sketched in Figure 5. The insertions after b3 and b9 constitute further variances (Figure 3(a)). Interestingly, they are spatially close together (Figure 1(a)). Moreover, ART2.2 contains additional C-terminal residues, one of which forms a disulfide bond (Figure 5). Native ART2.2 contains a GPI anchor attached at its C-terminal Ser226.22 As sketched in Figure 5, this anchor ties the enzyme to the membrane in such a manner that the active center is exposed to the environment, permitting ADP-ribosylation of targets on the surface of large bodies, for instance of membrane-bound proteins. The Cys21-Cys223

disulfide bond and the two N-terminal helices of ART2.2 face the membrane. In particular, this disulfide but also the helices a1 and a2 at the surface strengthen the mount of the enzyme on the membrane (Figure 5), because they prevent the unraveling of the chain fold when the enzyme is subjected to shear forces running parallel with the membrane surface. Such forces are to be expected in mechanically rough environments. The second disulfide Cys121-Cys173 is also located at the protein surface, tying the ends of the two core strands b2 and b6 together and thus stabilizing them. Both disulfide bridges and also the N-terminal a-helices are characteristic features of all ecto-ARTs.

Eukaryotic ADP-Ribosyl Transferase ART2.2

Enzymatic activity The five independent ART2.2 molecules of the three crystal forms were used to scrutinize the active center in more detail. In Figure 6(a) and (b) we show the molecules with bound BNA and glycerol in their electron densities. The identity of the ligands is clear. BNA binds with its amide to the backbone atoms of Gly127, which is equivalent to Trp350 of VIP2C and Gly863 of PARP, for example. The bound glycerol from the cryoprotectant indicates that the nicotinamide pocket is also a weak general binding site. The remainder of the NADþbinding site in ART2.2 contains numerous water molecules, indicating that NADþ does not bind very tightly to the enzyme because water counteracts entropically when released. A superposition of the five ART2.2 structures shows slight but clear movements at the active center (Figure 6(c)). In particular, residues Glu159, Phe160, Gln187 and Glu189 of the unligated structure (crystal form C) are displaced from their locations in the BNAligated structure. To some extent this applies also for Tyr78, Arg126 and Ser147. Residues Glu159, Phe160 and Gln187 move toward the binding nicotinamide, indicating a recognizable though small induced-fit. The structural alignment of ART2.2, VIP2C and exotoxin C3 in Figure 3(a) revealed 12 conserved residues within this subfamily, namely Ala74, Tyr78, Asn87, Arg91, Arg126, Ser147, Ser149, Leu150, Tyr177, Glu189, Leu191 and Tyr198 (ART2.2 numbering). Among them, only the equivalent of Glu189 is conserved in ETA and PARP as well as in all bacterial ARTs. Arg126 and Ser147 are conserved in all ADP-ribosyl transferases except for diphtheria toxin, ETA and PARP; the latter have His and Tyr residues at the corresponding positions.9,10 Residues Ala74, Leu191 and Tyr198 are internal and conserved for structural reasons. Tyr78, Asn87, Ser147 and Glu189 are hydrogen bonded to each other and surround the nicotinamide ribose where the ADPribosyl transfer takes place (Figure 7). Arg91 most

likely binds in a sandwich arrangement to the adenine of NADþ, and Arg126 binds to its pyrophosphate. Interestingly, the conserved residues Ser149, Leu150 and Tyr177 are close to the active center but point outwards as shown in Figure 7. Leu150 is particularly exposed, indicating that it may participate in target recognition. An alignment of the four known ART2 variants, namely ART2.1 and ART2.2 from rat and mouse, shows an astonishingly low conservation. Only 140 residues or 62% are conserved in all of them. In particular, the regions around positions 83, 160 and 185 surrounding the nicotinamide-binding site are not well conserved. This suggests that the variants may accept different targets. The additional two cysteine residues of ART2.1 from mouse are close together in space. Most likely, they form a disulfide bridge fastening the loop around residue 180 near the nicotinamide site to the loop at residue 60 between helices a2 and a3. This location at the active center may explain why ART2.1 becomes active only on disulfide reduction.27 The low conservation and the mobility of the regions around the active center that form the putative target docking sites are remarkable. However, the actual binding position of a target molecule accepting the ADP-ribosyl group is only known for PARP where the acceptor is the ADPribose head of the ADP-ribose polymer.28 The PARP complex has demonstrated that the equivalent of the strictly conserved Glu189 binds to the 2-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose and also the incoming nucleophile, thus deprotonating the nucleophile and facilitating the ribose transition. In its oxidized state nicotinamide is a most suitable leaving group. The geometry suggests that it stays in its pocket while ADP-ribose forms an a-glycosidic bond with the incoming nucleophile.

The superposition is on the basis of the Ca atoms of the 25 residues of the four-stranded b-core defined in Figure 4 and depicted in Figure 1(a). Interactions with NADþ are to be expected with residues Leu5, Thr79, Asn87, Arg91, Arg126, Gly127, Phe132, Phe142, Gln144, Ser147, Phe160, Phe168, Gln187 and Glu189.
