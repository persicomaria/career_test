Insights into the Structure, Mechanism, and Regulation of Scavenger mRNA Decapping Activity
Meigang Gu,1 Carme Fabrega,1 Shin-Wu Liu,2 Hudan Liu,2 Megerditch Kiledjian,2 and Christopher D. Lima1,* 1 Structural Biology Program Sloan-Kettering Institute New York, New York 10021 2 Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience Rutgers University Piscataway, New Jersey 08854 dyl hydrolase family and catalyzes capped mRNA hydrolysis in the 5 -3 decay pathway in a deadenylation and metal-dependent reaction that releases m7G diphosphate (m7GDP) and monophosphate terminated mRNA (pRNA) (Dunckley and Parker, 1999; Wang et al., 2002; van Dijk et al., 2002; Lykke-Andersen, 2002). The second decapping activity identified in eukaryotes was attributed to DcpS, the scavenger decapping enzyme that catalyzes 7-methyl guanosine specific hydrolase activity in a process that was shown to be functionally linked to the mammalian exosome (Wang and Kiledjian, 2001; Liu et al., 2002). In the 3 -5 exoribonuclease pathway, DcpS catalyzes cap hydrolysis in a deadenylation and 3 to 5 exonuclease-dependent yet metal-independent mechanism, releasing m7G monophosphate (m7Gp) and diphosphate terminated oligo mRNA (ppRNA) (Wang and Kiledjian, 2001; Liu et al., 2002; Rodgers et al., 2002). Interestingly, DcpS activity has also been implicated in the 5 -3 exoribonuclease decay pathway due to its susceptibility to m7GDP competition (Liu et al., 2002) and activity against m7GDP in a reaction that releases phosphate and m7GMP (van Dijk et al., 2003). In both activities, DcpS may serve a vital role by eliminating potential inhibitors of translation, export, and processing of RNA through removal of m7G cap intermediates that interfere with factors that recognize messenger RNA via the m7G cap. Despite the apparent need to remove pools of residual m7G cap after degradation, the cell must also ensure that decapping enzymes be tightly regulated insomuch as their activities, if misdirected, would lead to premature decapping of messenger mRNA and subsequent mRNA decay. To better understand the mechanism and regulation of DcpS activity, we have determined the x-ray structure of the human scavenger decapping enzyme DcpS in complex with two residual cap analogs, m7GpppG and m7GpppA. This study, in combination with biochemical characterization of wild-type and mutant DcpS isoforms, reveals details of a dramatically asymmetric dimeric DcpS structure that suggests an inherent autoregulatory mechanism to control scavenger decapping activity in the cell. Results Overview of the DcpS Structure Full-length recombinant human DcpS consisted of amino acids 1-337. DcpS-cap analog complexes were obtained by conservative substitution of the active site histidine (His277) to asparagine. Coincubation and crystallization with m7GpppG or m7GpppA cap analog produced DcpS crystals that contained two polypeptide chains per asymmetric unit and belonged to space group P212121. Data from native and derivative DcpSm7GpppG crystals were used to calculate phases and the DcpS-m7GpppA structure was solved using DcpS-m7GpppG as a starting point for refinement (Table 1). Both DcpS models included amino acids 38337 (protomer A, closed, pink) and 40-336 (protomer B,

Summary Complete removal of residual N-7 guanine cap from degraded messenger RNA is necessary to prevent accumulation of intermediates that might interfere with RNA processing, export, and translation. The human scavenger decapping enzyme, DcpS, catalyzes residual cap hydrolysis following mRNA degradation, releasing N-7 methyl guanosine monophosphate and 5 -diphosphate terminated cap or mRNA products. DcpS structures bound to m7GpppG or m7GpppA reveal an asymmetric DcpS dimer that simultaneously creates an open nonproductive DcpS-cap complex and a closed productive DcpS-cap complex that al° ternate via 30 A domain movements. Structural and biochemical analysis suggests an autoregulatory mechanism whereby premature decapping mRNA is prevented by blocking the conformational changes that are required to form a closed productive active site capable of cap hydrolysis. Introduction Eukaryotic messenger RNA is modified at its 5 -end by an N-7 methyl guanosine attached by a 5 -5 linkage via a triphosphate bridge to the first nucleotide of the mRNA body. The 5 cap structure is essential and required for pre-mRNA splicing, export, stability, and efficient translation (Furuichi and Shatkin, 2000). Transcriptional regulation and mRNA decay work in conjunction to control the abundance and lifetime of cellular mRNA, and both serve to regulate the time that messages interact with the translation apparatus (Ross, 1995). In eukaryotic cells, two major pathways are utilized to degrade mRNA, and both are initiated with deadenylation of the polyadenylated [poly(A)] tail. In the 5 -3 decay pathway, the mRNA cap is hydrolyzed following deadenylation exposing the 5 end to 5 -3 exoribonuclease activities (Parker and Song, 2004). In the 3 -5 decay pathway, degradation of the mRNA body continues from the 3 end following deadenylation to generate a cap structure that is hydrolyzed (Wang and Kiledjian, 2001; Rodgers et al., 2002). Decapping activities catalyze cap hydrolysis through at least two distinct mechanisms. First, the mRNA decapping enzyme Dcp2 belongs to the nudix phosphati*Correspondence: lima@limalab.org

Amino acids 1-37 (protomer A) and 1-39, 337 (protomer B) were not modeled as interpretable electron density was not observed. The DcpS structure includes two distinct domains, a dimeric C-terminal domain that includes amino acids 146-336(337) and the putative active site and a dimeric N-terminal domain consisting of amino acids 38(40)145 that is required for decapping activity insomuch as N-terminal truncations up to amino acid 33 are active in decapping assays and deletions beyond this point are not (S.-W.L., H.L., M.G., C.D.L. and M.K., unpublished data; see below) (Figure 1). The observed dimer is consistent with the apparent molecular weight as measured in solution by gel filtration chromatography (not shown). The N- and C-terminal domains are covalently associated through two hinged linkers centered near Arg145 in each of the two protomer chains. The N-terminal domain is formed through a domainswapped dimer. Each N-terminal protomer contributes three anti-parallel -strands ( 1-3) to one half of the domain before contributing one -helix ( A) and two anti-parallel -strands ( 4-5) to the dimer partner. The polypeptide contributes another -strand ( 6) and -helix ( B) to complete the N-terminal domain (Figure 1B). The N-terminal domain protomers are related by ° 2-fold symmetry (1.24 A root mean square deviation [rmsd]). An extensive interface is generated in the domain-swapped configuration between protomers A and ° B that buries 3500 A2 of molecular surface area as calculated by GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). The symmetry,

topology, and buried surface area suggest that the N-terminal dimer acts as a single rigid domain. Each C-terminal DcpS protomer is formed by five -helices and eight -strands, six of which form a continuous anti-parallel -sheet that includes several DcpS catalytic residues. In contrast to the domain-swapped N-terminal domain, each C-terminal protomer appears self-contained (protomer A, pink; protomer B, blue) (Fig° ure 1C). The C-terminal dimer interface buries 1400 A2 of surface area and is mediated via symmetric interactions between amino acids 283-296, helix F, and -strands 7 and 14. C-terminal DcpS protomers are related by 2-fold ° symmetry (0.94 A rmsd), but significant conformational changes were observed between C, C*, and G when comparing protomers (Figures 1C and 2). It was previously noted that the DcpS C-terminal domain contains a nucleophilic histidine side chain (His277) and related sequence motifs characteristic of the HIT protein family (Liu et al., 2002). HIT proteins are relatively small (10-20kDa), highly conserved, and nearly ubiquitous, and are so named for a conserved C-terminal His-X-His-X-His or HIstidine Triad HIT motif (Seraphin, 1992; Robinson and Aitkin, 1994). HIT proteins have detectable nucleotidyl hydrolase activity that is dependent on the central HIT motif histidine side chain in a mechanism that involves direct attack the nucleoside phosphate to form a covalent nucleotidylphosphohistidine enzyme adduct prior to hydrolysis (Lima et al., 1997a). DcpS includes the HIT motif on -strand 12 in addition to other conserved elements that will be discussed in subsequent sections.

The DcpS dimer is strikingly asymmetric, simultaneously creating open (blue) and closed (pink) conformations on opposite sides of the dimer (Figure 1D). In the open configuration, few contacts are observed between

Sites of amino acid substitution are indicated below the alignment by red circles (disrupts activity), pink circles (low activity), green circles (no effect on activity), and blue circles (increased activity). Differences observed for contacts between N- and C-terminal domains and between DcpS and respective cap analogs are highlighted above the alignment (see Supplemental Table S2 for details). Circles indicating contacts in the open form are shown above the circles indicating contacts in the closed form. A circled C indicates contacts cap while a circled D indicates inter- or intradomain contacts. A circled minus sign indicates an absence of contacts to either protein or cap.

domains of protomer A (pink) that includes residues from domain-swapped -strands 4 and 5 from protomer B (blue) (Figure 1A and 1D). The dimer asymmetry is not created by simple domain rotations about a single axis, but by three rigid body rotations of 40 , 40 , and 10 ° about orthogonal axes that results in a 36 A gap (C -C )

between Asp111 and Trp175, two residues in direct con° tact in the closed form (6 A apart, C -C ). The presumed rigidity of the dimeric N- and C-terminal domains suggests that closing one half of the molecule forces the other open, and opening one side forces the other closed.

DcpS Structure 71

Cap Binding and Catalysis DcpS structures were determined in complex with ° ° m7GpppG at 1.9 A resolution and m7GpppA at 2.02 A resolution (Figure 3; Table 1). Both m7GpppG and m7GpppA include the unique N7-methyl guanosine nucleotide linked 5 -5 through a triphosphate bridge ( , , and ) to a second nucleoside (m7G-5 -p p p -5 -N), where N represents the first nucleoside of the mRNA body. Two cap structures are coordinated per DcpS dimer in each of the C-terminal domain HIT motifs (Figure 1). In the open configuration, m7GpppG and m7GpppA adopt extended conformations and interact almost exclusively with the C-terminal domain HIT motif (Figure 3A; protomer B, blue). The closed DcpS configuration reveals direct and capmediated contacts between the N- and C-terminal domains that involve residues from both protomer chains (Figures 3C and 3E; protomer A, pink; protomer B, blue). The cap analogs adopt different conformations from that observed in the open state, and m7GpppG and m7GpppA exhibit differences from each other in the closed state (Figures 2 and 3; see Supplemental Table S2 at http:// www.molecule.org/cgi/content/full/14/1/67/DC1). For example, the m7GpppG guanine base is observed in anti conformation while the m7GpppA adenine base is observed in syn conformation (Figures 3C and 3E). Although adenine and guanine make similar VDW contacts to the aliphatic portion of Lys207, the anti and syn conformations of the respective bases results in different VDW contacts to residues within the N-terminal domain. Vicinal contacts were observed between the m7GpppG guanine N1, N2, and O6 atoms and the side chain carboxylate of Glu83 and N atom of Lys128, respectively (Figure 3E). Differences were also observed between cap analogs with respect to the relative rotations about the - or - phosphoanhydride bonds, differences that result in alternate contacts between the protein and cap within the active site (compare panels in Figure 3). To examine whether these differences reflect a preference for either m7GpppG or m7GpppA, a decapping assay was used to measure hydrolysis of radioactively labeled m7GpppG in the presence of unlabeled m7GpppG or m7GpppA (Figure 3G). These data confirm that m7GpppG and m7GpppA compete effectively for DcpS under similar conditions and suggest that the observed structural differences between cap analogs in the closed state reflect the inherent plasticity in the DcpS active site, a beneficial feature if DcpS is to bind and hydrolyze m7GpppN where N could be A, G, U, or C. Numerous interactions were observed in the extensive interfaces between domains and cap analogs in respective DcpS complexes. To assess the relative importance of these interactions with respect to cap binding and hydrolysis, several DcpS amino acids were substituted by mutagenesis and individual proteins were tested for activity in vitro using a decapping assay to measure hydrolysis of radioactively labeled m7GpppG (see Experimental Procedures; Figures 2, 3, and 4). Single time points were taken within the linear range of the assay (data not shown). His277 and His279 are conserved among DcpS family members and comprise two conserved histidine residues observed in other HIT proteins. H277N and H279N

both inactivate DcpS in decapping assays (Figure 4A). His279 makes direct contacts to the cap and phosphate and His277 is the nucleophile that attacks the cap phosphate in a reaction analogous to that proposed for the HIT protein family (Lima et al., 1997a) (Figure 3). Hydrogen bond interactions are observed between the Tyr217 OH and His279 N . Interestingly, Y217F disrupted activity more than Y217A, indicating a critical role for the hydrogen bond to His279 N . His268 is proximal to the phosphate and H268N disrupted activity (Figures 3 and 4A). His268 is substituted to Asn or Gln in other HIT proteins, indicating a unique role for His268 in DcpS activity that is not conserved in other HIT proteins. S272A, R294A, or R294K substitution resulted in proteins with wild-type activities, suggesting that these side chain contacts to the phosphate are not required for activity (Figures 3 and 4A). The C-terminal domain makes similar contacts to the m7G base, ribose, and -phosphate in both m7GpppG and m7GpppA structures in either open or closed states (Figures 2 and 3). The m7G base makes Van der Waals (VDW) contacts to the Tyr273 aromatic ring and is stacked between Trp175 and Leu206. Vicinal contacts are observed between the m7G N1 and exocyclic N2 atoms by the Glu185 side chain carboxylate and Pro204 carbonyl oxygen while the ribose O2 and O3 atoms are contacted by the Asp205 carboxylate and Lys207 N atom. The phosphate is positioned over Asn277 (His277 in wild-type) and is coordinated via hydrogen bonding interactions from Ser272 and Tyr273 backbone amide atoms, the His268 N atom, and more distantly by the His279 N atom (Figure 3A). Mutation of Trp175 or Glu185 resulted in protein with severely defective decapping activities and mutation of Pro204 (contacts m7G base) or Asp205 (contacts m7G ribose) also resulted in activity levels nearly half that of wild-type (Figures 3 and 4B). Leu206 stacks above the m7G base but is surprisingly not required for activity insomuch as L206A retains over 90% of wild-type activity. Lys207 contributes its N atom to interactions with the m7G ribose and phosphate in both open and closed configurations. Lys207 also contributes VDW interactions to the second base in the closed DcpS configuration. Whereas K207R resulted in a protein with 85% activity, K207A resulted in protein with less than 30% activity. Several additional contacts between DcpS and the m7G base in the closed configuration emanate from a conserved loop between -strands 4 and 5 in the N-terminal domain-swapped dimer (Figure 2). These interactions include m7G VDW contacts to Phe108, VDW contacts between Tyr113 and the m7G 7-methyl group, and hydrogen bond interactions between Asn110 and Glu185 (Figures 3C and 3E). F108A resulted in protein with 50% activity while N110A or Y113A resulted in protein with no detectable activity (Figure 4B). Residues from the N-terminal domain make VDW contacts to the second cap base and vicinal contacts to the m7GpppG guanine base (Figure 3E). Alanine substitution at Ile61, Phe63, Ile83, Glu85, or Lys128 resulted in proteins with less than wild-type activity, but only I83A and E85A exhibited less than 25% activity (Figure 4C). Ile83 is located at the center of VDW contacts to the second

base while Glu85 contributes hydrogen-bonding interactions to the second guanine base. Analysis of Residues Involved in Open and Closed Conformation While more complex than illustrated, the major differences between open and closed DcpS configurations can be distilled into conformational changes in helix C, conformational changes in the linker between N- and C-terminal domains, and a rigid movement of helix G. Combined, these changes bring helix B and the N-terminal domain into direct contact with the cap and C-terminal domain (Figures 5A and 5B). Helix C occurs in two segments in the open state, C and C*, as it is disrupted by a proline residue at position 164 that breaks

the helix into two segments (Figures 1C, 2, and 5C). In the closed state, nearly all of the hydrogen bond interactions observed in helix C* are broken to form new contacts to residues within helix B and helix G (Figures 5C and 5D). The hinge linking N- and C-terminal domains occurs between residues Tyr143 and Arg149 (Figures 5E and 5F). In the open state, the linker is extended, enabling interactions between Arg149 and Leu148, Arg145 and the second cap base, and contacts between residues in the hinge (Arg54 and Tyr143) and residues in the N-terminal domain (Leu53 and Tyr143). In the closed state, the hinge bends 90 through a series of Phi-Psi changes that are distributed across Arg145, Gln146, and Asp147 (values reported in Figure 5 legend). The bent

hinge brings Arg149 into contact with Asp147, the Leu144 main chain amide and Arg145 side chain into contact with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Leu53 and Val52, respectively, and Tyr143 to within proximity of the second cap base (nucleotide not shown) (Figure 5F). To assess their relative importance on activity, DcpS amino acid residues proposed to stabilize open or closed DcpS conformations were substituted and tested for activity (Figure 4D). Arg58, Arg58 , Asp59, Asp59 , Glu286, and Glu286 exist at the dimer interface in an asymmetric network of salt-bridging interactions. To disrupt this interaction, Arg58 was substituted to alanine, resulting in protein with 125% activity of the wildtype enzyme. Lys138 is located on the surface of helix B and its side chain contacts main chain atoms in the C-terminal domain only in the closed state (Figure 5D) and K138D resulted in protein with 250% of wild-type activity. Mutation of Arg145 to alanine (178%) or proline (113%) and mutation of Gln146 to proline (142%) also resulted in proteins with more than wild-type activity while mutation of Arg322 to alanine resulted in protein with only slightly increased activity. Discussion N-Terminal Domain Is Related to NTF2-like Proteins A Protein Data Bank search using DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993) revealed significant structural homology between the N-terminal domain and three other proteins. In order of ranking, structural similarity was observed for carotenoid binding protein (CBP) (PDB 1m98; ° with 3.2 A rmsd and 14% sequence identity (ID) over 79 amino acids (aa); Z-score of 4.5) (Kerfeld et al., 2003), ° metazoan mRNA export factor p15 (PDB 1jn5; 3.9 A rmsd with 13% ID over 80 aa; Z-score of 3.8) (Fribourg et al., 2001), and yeast mRNA export factor Mex67 (PDB ° 1of5; 3.4 A rmsd with 7% ID over 66 aa; Z-score of 3.4) (Fribourg and Conti, 2003). Although DcpS shares structural homology to these proteins and to other NTF2-like domain family members, the unique topology and organization of the DcpS domain-swapped dimer is dissimilar from either Mex67/Mtr2 or p15/TAP complexes. Interestingly, both Mex67 and p15 form heterodimers via their exposed -sheet with Mtr2 or TAP, respectively (Fribourg et al., 2001; Fribourg and Conti, 2003). In contrast, the DcpS N-terminal domain -sheet is fully exposed in the open state or buried in interactions

with residual cap in the closed form. Although Mex67/ Mtr2 and p15/TAP have been implicated in mRNA export pathways, any functional significance to the DcpS N-terminal domain structure remains unclear. The C-Terminal DcpS Domain Is Related, but Distinct from the HIT Protein Family A DALI search of the Protein Data Bank (Holm and Sander, 1993) revealed structural similarity between DcpS and a number of HIT proteins. In order of ranking, structural similarity was observed to human HIT (also known as protein kinase C interacting protein (PKCI) ° (PDB 1kpf; 2.1 A rmsd with 17% ID over 101 aa; Z-score of 10.7) (Lima et al., 1996), fragile histidine triad protein ° (FHIT) (PDB 1fit; 2.8 A rmsd with 12% ID over 92 aa; Z-score of 6.4) (Lima et al., 1997b), and nitrolase-fragile ° histidine triad fusion protein (NIT-FHIT) (PDB 1ems; 2.8 A rmsd with 20% ID over 92 aa; Z-score of 6.3) (Pace et al., 2000). HIT proteins are observed as dimers and include a continuous 10-stranded anti-parallel -sheet that is formed by combining a five-stranded -sheet from each protomer across the dimer interface. HIT protein dimers are topologically related to a protomer of galactose-1phosphate uridylyltransferase (GalT) (Holm and Sander, 1997; Brenner et al., 1997), a family of proteins that catalyze nucleotidyltransferase activities via a pingpong mechanism involving an analogous active site histidine residue. Despite the similarities between HIT, GalT, and DcpS with respect to mechanism and active site architecture, DcpS appears topologically dissimilar from HIT proteins or GalT as the continuous -sheet observed in GalT or HIT dimers is not present in the DcpS dimer interface (Figure 1C). In addition and as noted above, the DcpS C-terminal domain is not sufficient for cap hydrolysis, indicating substantive differences between these protein families. Cap Recognition, Nucleotide Conformation, and Catalysis Cap recognition by DcpS is achieved through motifs that are both similar and distinct from other cap-forming or cap-binding proteins. Cap analogs have been observed in structures of vaccinia cap 2 -O-methyltransferase (Hodel et al., 1998), the mRNA 5 cap binding protein eIF-4E (Marcotrigiano et al., 1997), reovirus RNA polymerase 3 (Tao et al., 2002), cap-binding

protein complex (CBP) (Calero et al., 2002), mRNA ° guanylyltransferase (Hakansson and Wigley, 1998), and mRNA N-7 guanine methyltransferase (Fabrega et al., 2004). Structures of eIF4E bound to m7G diphosphate exhibit a classic mode of cap recognition and show the m7G base to be stacked between two tryptophan residues in - interactions (Trp56 and Trp102). Additional VDW interactions occur between the edge of a third tryptophan (Trp166) and the N7-methyl group (Marcotrigiano et al., 1997). Guanine specificity is achieved through hydrogen bond contacts to the m7G N1, N2, and O6 positions via Glu103 and the Met102 amide. DcpS achieves N7-methyl guanine specificity through hydrogen bonding interactions to the m7G N1 and exocyclic N2 positions (see above). An extensive VDW cage is formed around the m7G base in the closed DcpS conformation by Leu206 and the aromatic side chains from Trp175, Tyr273, and Tyr113 (Figures 3C and 3E, Tyr273 not shown). The Tyr113 aromatic ring is perpendicular to the m7G base and makes direct contacts to the m7G methyl group. Aromatic residues are conserved at these positions while Leu206, the residue located above the m7G base, is conserved or conservatively substituted in other DcpS orthologs (Figure 2). Residues and motifs conserved throughout the HIT family are used by DcpS to coordinate and catalyze phosphohydrolase activity at the m7Gp -phosphate position. DcpS includes His275, His277, and His279, three of the four histidine residues conserved in other HIT proteins. The fourth conserved HIT protein histidine is substituted to tyrosine in DcpS (Tyr217) (Figure 2). Although somewhat different, each C-terminal DcpS protomer appears to contain all the elements required for HIT protein function insomuch as the DcpS active site superimposes well to active sites in other HIT proteins (see above). Despite these similarities and the observation that the C-terminal domain appears able to bind cap in open or closed configurations, the purified C-terminal domain dimer is unable to catalyze decapping activity in vitro (see below; S.-W.L., H.L., M.G., C.D.L., and M.K., unpublished data). Since few structural differences were observed when comparing active site residues or the m7Gp segments of the cap in either open or closed DcpS configurations, we suspected that the conformational changes associated with the , , and second nucleoside positions might be important for activation and cap hydrolysis (see above, Figure 3). Although speculative, the large structural differences observed for the respective positions of the ppN leaving group suggest that initial phosphate attack by His277 and disruption of the bond may be promoted in part through activation of the leaving group rather than through direct activation of the enzyme nucleophile. DcpS Conformational Changes The two DcpS active sites exhibit asymmetry and exist in open and closed conformations in our structures. In the open configuration, the N- and C-terminal domains make few direct contacts while the nucleotide interacts primarily with the HIT motif in the C-terminal domain, lies extended and exposed across the interface between N- and C-terminal domains, and stacks its second

base between Arg145 and Arg322 (Figure 5A). In the ° closed state, a 30 A conformational change brings the N-terminal domain over the C-terminal domain in an orientation that alters the nucleotide conformation through additional VDW, charged, and hydrogen bonding interactions in the DcpS-cap interface (Figure 5B). The mutational analysis presented in previous sections suggests the importance of several contacts observed between cap and DcpS in the closed configuration, and suggests that enzyme closure is a critical step during the DcpS catalytic cycle. Interestingly, most mutations in the interface or hinge resulted in proteins with higher than wild-type activity (Figure 4D), indicating that destabilization of the closed conformation does not prevent closure, but facilitates faster product release after hydrolysis. Although the loss of activity for K138D/ K142D does not fit this profile, it suggests the importance of Lys142 in its interactions with the phosphate (as observed in the m7GpppG complex) or its importance in mediating closure of the active site to a productive conformation. Proline substitution within the hinge was predicted to restrict flexibility, but results indicate that single proline substitution could be compensated through increased mobility at other positions. It is interesting to note that DcpS activity can be upregulated through mutagenesis of the interface, suggesting that DcpS is not evolutionarily optimized for maximal decapping activity. While speculative, this observation may point to the existence of factors involved in regulating decapping activity in the cell. Structural Insights to Regulation of DcpS Decapping Activity DcpS has robust decapping activity against cap analog (m7GpppG), diminished activity against short capped RNA oligomers (10-20mers), and low activity against large and mature capped RNA (100 or more bases) (Liu et al., 2002). These activities highlight an interesting property of DcpS, its ability to selectively hydrolyze cap structure while neglecting mature capped mRNA as a substrate. Thus, the biologically significant question remains as to why DcpS does not catalyze cap hydrolysis when the cap is linked to larger RNA. Our data suggest that DcpS must close to promote catalysis insomuch as contacts observed in the closed conformation are required for normal activity and the enzyme structure reveals two distinct and mutually exclusive active sites (Figure 6A and 6B). In the open state, the N- and ° C-terminal domains are 36 A apart and the cap is coordinated on the protein surface in an extended configuration that fully exposes the O3 ribose and site of RNA attachment. In contrast, the closed configuration reveals the cap coordinated deep in the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains. Although partially buried, the second ribose and hydroxyl positions are still exposed and visible through a narrow protein channel that is sufficiently wide to accommodate a single-stranded RNA chain (Figure 6C). In addition, the channel perimeter is primarily formed by side chains that could move away to further widen the channel to accommodate RNA (model not shown). Two possible models could explain the inability of DcpS to cleave larger mature capped RNA molecules.

DcpS Structure 77

Open and closed sides of the dimer are labeled. (B) Ribbon representation of DcpS presented in (A). (C) DcpS surface representation presenting an orthogonal view into the large open cleft to show how m7GpppG lays across the surface nearly fully exposed in the open configuration and partially buried in the closed configuration. Magnified view shown to the right of (C) depicting the positions of both 2 and 3 ribose hydroxyls to indicate the approximate position of the mRNA body. (D) Cartoon representation of the DcpS dimer in complex with cap (left) or short capped oligo mRNA (right). While one side closes to promote catalysis during cap cleavage, the other side is forced open to permit binding of a short capped mRNA oligomer (during or after 3 -5 exosome mediated degradation). Once RNA is degraded to a suitable length, the open side closes over the cap structure to permit formation of a productive active site while forcing the previously closed side to open, thus enabling release of m7Gp and ppN cap products. Once released, another round of closure, hydrolysis, opening, and subsequent release of cleaved cap products could occur.

In the first, DcpS binds the cap on larger RNA molecules while utilizing surfaces on either the N- or C-terminal domain in RNA binding interactions to restrict closure

and activation of the enzyme through a steric mechanism. In the second model, DcpS is unable to bind the 5 end of large capped mRNA due to the increased

Molecular Cell 78

entropy inherent to larger and more flexible RNA molecules, thus blocking substrate binding, closure, and enzyme activation until the RNA length and entropy is reduced via 3 -5 degradation. Two biochemical results favor an incarnation of an entropic block to binding and hydrolysis. First, DcpS has reduced affinity for 100mer capped RNA, despite containing the cap structure, consistent with the presence of an entropic barrier to binding larger RNA molecules. Second, DcpS hydrolysis of residual cap structure is not appreciably inhibited in the presence of capped or uncapped RNA (S.-W.L. and M.K., unpublished data), suggesting the absence of an independent RNA binding site on the DcpS surface that is used as a steric impediment to DcpS closure. These observations lead us to propose the following model (Figure 6D). At some stage during 3 -5 degradation, the cap becomes available for interaction with DcpS, either alone or as part of a short RNA oligomer (right side, panel 6D-1). If associated prior to completion of the degradation process, DcpS must wait for the mRNA body to be degraded before it can close to form a productive active site. Once small enough, DcpS closes around the capped RNA to promote hydrolysis (right side, panels 6D-2 and 6D-3). Once hydrolyzed, DcpS must open to release the products of cap hydrolysis before it can compete for another capped RNA (right side, panels 6D-4). Although we are currently unable to comment on the possible cooperative nature of the two equal but distinctly asymmetric active sites (one must open while the other closes), it appears an attractive feature to exploit if further regulation of the decapping apparatus is required. Yeast DcpS orthologs were recently reported in two species, and while each share significant similarity to human DcpS, they vary significantly in their ability to hydrolyze capped RNA. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two DcpS-like proteins (Dcs1p and Dcs2p) and while Dcs1 and Dcs2 share 90% sequence similarity, only Dcs1 was shown to catalyze cap hydrolysis in a reaction analogous to that of DcpS (Liu et al., 2002). Interestingly, the DcpS ortholog Nhm1p in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was also reported to catalyze mRNA decapping, but was also able to catalyze decapping on large capped RNA (Salehi et al., 2002). The activities observed for S. pombe Nhm1p are difficult to explain based on our work. Nhm1p includes most of the critical amino acids required for DcpS activity (Figure 2), but Nhm1p must bind large capped RNA substrates with appreciable affinity to catalyze the reported activities (Salehi et al., 2002). As DcpS is not able to bind large capped RNA with appreciable affinity, and as Nhm1p does not include additional domains with known RNA binding activity, Nhm1p must utilize some as yet unknown mechanism to bind and hydrolyze cap from large RNA molecules. In contrast to Nhm1p, structure-based sequence alignment reveals differences that might explain the divergent activities reported for DcpS orthologs in S. cerevisiae (Figure 2). Lys142 is strictly conserved in DcpS orthologs, but is substituted to glycine in Dcs2, whereas Arg294 is conserved as either arginine or lysine, but is substituted to methionine in Dcs2. In both instances, these basic amino acid side chains reach into the active site to make direct contact with the triphosphate bridge of the cap.

The recent structure determination and characterization of Dcp1 highlighted the importance of several Dcp1 interfaces involved in regulation and control of decapping activities in the 5 -3 RNA decay pathway (She et al., 2004). In this system, decapping activity is regulated in part by Dcp1 association with the catalytic subunit Dcp2 to generate the active Dcp1/Dcp2 decapping enzyme. Although DcpS is mechanistically and structurally unrelated to Dcp1/Dcp2, it is interesting to note that both systems go to great lengths to prevent premature decapping of messenger mRNA and subsequent mRNA decay by controlling the assembly of a productive active site.
Experimental Procedures Recombinant Protein Production and Purification The human DcpS open reading frame was PCR amplified from pET28-hDcpS plasmid (Liu et al., 2002) and inserted into the pSMT3 directional TOPO vector (Mossessova and Lima, 2000; Invitrogen) to generate the plasmid pSMT3-hDcpS. His277 was substituted to Asn in pSMT3-hDcpSH277N with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to encode a mutant form of DcpS (hDcpSH277N) fused to an N-terminal His6-Smt3 tag. 10 l of E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Novagen) containing pSMT3-hDcpSH277N were fermented at 37 C to A600 of 3 before 1 mM IPTG induction for 4 hr at 25 C. Cells were harvested and suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20% sucrose, 350 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.1% IGEPAL, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol (BME), and 10 g/ml DNAse before sonication and removal of insoluble material by centrifugation. His6-Smt3hDcpSH277N was purified by metal-affinity (QIAGEN Ni-NTA Superflow resin) and anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ, Pharmacia) by virtue of the Smt3 tag. The His6-Smt3 tag was removed by Ulp1 proteolysis (Mossessova and Lima, 2000) and hDcpSH277N was separated from His6-Smt3 by gel filtration (Superdex200, Pharmacia). 3 mg of hDcpSH277N was isolated per liter of E. coli as estimated by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). hDcpSH277N was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 C.

Crystallographic Analysis hDcpSH277N (0.5 mM) was incubated with 10 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM m7GpppG cap analog (New England Biolabs) for 10 min prior to crystallization. A 3 96-well factorial crystallization screen did not produce crystalline material, but microcrystals were obtained through optimization and improved by addition of yttrium chloride. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion against a well solution containing 0.1 M (pH 5.0) sodium acetate, 10 mM yttrium chloride, and 10% polyethylene glycerol 8000. Derivatives were obtained by soaking crystals in 1 mM or 10 mM thimerosal for 16 hr. Data were collected on the native and 1 mM mercury derivative at the Advanced Photon Source SGX-CAT beamline. Data were collected on the 10 mM mercury derivative using a copper K source (Rigaku RU200), a confocal Osmic multilayer system, and a Raxis-IV imaging plate detector. Data were processed with DENZO, SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997), and CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) (Table 1). ° 1.9 A phases were calculated with SOLVE and RESOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999) using three mercury positions. The asymmetric unit contained one hDcpSH277N heterodimer. A partial model from RESOLVE was used to produce complete atomic models for each DcpS protomer in O (Jones et al., 1991). The model was refined ° to 1.9 A with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and consisted of resides 40-336 (protomer B), 38-337 (protomer A), two molecules of m7GpppG cap analog. Data were collected on crystals of the hDcpSH277Nm7GpppA complex at NSLS X4A (Brookhaven, NY). The model was ° rebuilt and refined to 2.02 A resolution. The final model for the m7GpppA-hDcpSH277N complex included hDcpSH277N residues 40-336 (protomer B), 38-337 (protomer A), two 7mGpppA molecules.

Biochemical Analysis with Mutagenesis Plasmids expressing DcpS proteins with substituted amino acids were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Novagen). A 40 ml LB culture was grown at 37 C to an A600 of 1, cooled to 30 C, induced with IPTG at 1 mM, and incubated for 4 hr. Cells were harvested, lysed, and prepared as above. Protein was purified by incubating the mixture with metal-affinity resin at 4 C for 10 min before recovering the resin by centrifugation. The beads were washed twice with buffer (350 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], and 1 mM BME), once with low salt buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], and 1 mM BME), and recovered in 50 l of low salt buffer. The target protein was released into the supernatant by cleaving DcpS from the resin by removing the His-Smt3 tag with Ulp1. Generation of Labeled Cap Structure RNA corresponding to the pcDNA3 polylinker (pcP) was transcribed in vitro by SP6 polymerase according to the manufacturer (Promega) from a PCR-generated template using SP6 promoter primer. The RNA was cap-labeled using the vaccinia virus capping enzyme in the presence of [ -32P] GTP and S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) as previously described (Wang et al., 1999) to label the first phosphate relative to the terminal guanosine (m7G*pppN-). 32P-labeled cap structure was generated by treating the cap-labeled RNA with 1 unit nuclease P1 (Roche), in 10 mM Tris:HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM ZnCl2 for 1 hr at 37 C as previously described (Wang and Kiledjian, 2001). The labeled cap analog was used as substrate for the decapping assays. Unlabeled methylated cap analogs and m7GMP were purchased from Ambion. Decapping Assay Decapping assays were carried out with recombinant DcpS or its mutant derivatives incubated with the labeled cap structure in IVDA buffer (10 mM Tris 7.5, 100 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 2 mM DTT, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 1 mM ATP, 0.4 mM GTP, and 0.1 mM Spermine) for 10 min at 37 C. The reactions were stopped and extracted once with an equal mixture of phenol:chloroform. Decapping products were resolved by PEI-cellulose TLC plates (Sigma) pre-run in H20. An aliquot of the reaction products was spotted onto the TLC and developed in 0.45 M (NH4)2SO4 at room temperature. The plates were dried and exposed to Kodak BioMax film or analyzed and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics phosphoroimager (Storm860) and ImageQuante-5.
