2-O-ribose methylation of eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs is guided by RNA duplexes consisting of rRNA and box C/D small nucleolar (sno)RNA sequences, the methylated sites invariably mapping five positions apart from the D box. Here we have analyzed the RNA duplex pairing constraints by investigating the features of 415 duplexes from the fungus, plant and animal kingdoms, and the evolution of those duplexes within the 124 sets they group into. The D-box upstream 1st and  15th positions consist of Watson­Crick base-pairs, G:U base-pairs and mismatched bases with ratios close to random assortments; these positions display single base differences in > 60% of the RNA duplex sets. The D-box upstream 2nd to 11th positions have > 90% Watson­Crick basepairs; they display single base mutations with a U-shaped distribution of lower values of 0% and 1.6% at the methylated site 5th and 4th positions, and double compensatory mutations leading to new Watson­Crick basepairs with an inverted U-shaped distribution of higher values at the 8th to 11th positions. Half of the single mutations at the 3rd to 11th positions resulted in G:U base-pairing, mainly through AG mutations in the rRNA strands and CT mutations in the snoRNA strands. Double compensatory mutations at the 3rd to 11th positions are extremely frequent, representing 36% of all mutations; they frequently arose from an AG mutation in the rRNA strands followed by a TC mutation in the snoRNA strands. Differences in the mutational pathways through which the rRNA and snoRNA strand evolved must be related to differences in the rRNA and snoRNA copy number and gene organization. Altogether these data identify the D-box upstream 3rd to 11th positions as box C/D snoRNA­rRNA duplex cores. The impact of the pairing constraints on the evolution of the 9 base-pair RNA duplex cores is discussed.

(rRNA) species and of some 80 different ribosomal proteins. While the 5 S rRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, the 5.8 S, 18 S and 25­28 S rRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase I as a single large precursor containing extra sequences that are removed in an ordered series of endo- and exonucleolytic cleavages. Modifications consisting of base methylations, the vast majority of which are added on riboses, and uridine to pseudo-uridine conversions occur at 100­200 sites of the rRNA precursor and precede its cleavage.1 Although mutants defec-

772 tive in some rRNA modifications have no detectable phenotype, the universal presence of rRNA modifications suggests that they provide an adaptive advantage throughout evolution.2­4 The evolution of the rRNA molecules has been severely constrained by their interaction with ribosomal proteins and by secondary and tertiary structure requirements. The secondary structure of the rRNAs comprises single-stranded and doublestranded regions that are formed by intramolecular Watson­Crick (W:C) ­ A:U and G:C ­ and G:U basepairs between short rRNA stretches otherwise separated by tens to hundreds of nucleotides. The rRNA stems largely evolved through molecular epistatic interactions, in which a deleterious mutation is masked by a second mutation. In this compensatory process, a W:C base-pair is replaced by a new W:C base-pair.5,6 rRNA molecules also pair over short stretches with small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) for the guiding of rRNA site-specific processing and modifications in eukaryotes and archeabacteria.7­9 There are two types of snoRNAs. The box H/ACA snoRNAs that carry the conserved box H (5-ANANNA-3) and ACA element guide pseudo-uridination. The box C/D snoRNAs that possess the conserved box C (5-RUGAUGA-3 where R stands for any purine) and box D (5-CUGA-3) guide ribose 2-O-methylation. SnoRNAs guide methylation at one site, or at two sites for the box C/D snoRNAs that harbor a pair of C and D internal boxes. Comparison of the snoRNA sets in the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans showed the conservation of 2/3 out of the 54 S. cerevisiae methylation sites. Compensatory mutations have been characterized within two rRNA and box C/D snoRNA duplexes from Oryza sativa and S. cerevisiae.10 To our knowledge, no systematic analysis of the evolution of the rRNA and box C/D snoRNA complementary sequences has been reported although, due to the number of the rRNA modified sites, and the fact that the rRNA genes are member of families of > 100 sequences, 104­105 nucleotides are concerned in most genomes. Here we perform extensive analysis and comparison of the 415 rRNA and box C/D snoRNA complementary sequences that are involved in guiding methylation at 124 rRNA sites from the six distantly related species Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, O. sativa, S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our data define box C/D snoRNA­ rRNA duplex cores of 9 bp over which single mutations have been severely counter-selected and double compensatory mutations, retained. In addition our study identifies differences in the mutational pathways through which the rRNA and snoRNA strands have evolved; these differences should be related to differences in the rRNA and snoRNA gene organization in most eukaryote genomes. Finally we show that mutations in the snoRNA sequences have a moderate impact on the evolution of the rRNA sequences throughout this period of the eukaryote evolution.

rRNA­snoRNA Duplex Evolution

Results
The D box-upstream 2nd position significantly limits the RNA duplex starts 2-O-ribose methylation of rRNA is dependent on the ability of short methylated site-encompassing sequences to form duplexes with anti-sequences from box C/D snoRNAs, the rRNA methylated site (MS) and its snoRNA complementary nucleotide (MS-CN) invariably mapping five positions upstream of the D box on the snoRNA strand (Figure 1). For convenience, the base-pair positions in the duplexes have been numbered relatively to the snoRNA D box; the positions mapping between the D box and MS:MS-CN position defined a duplex left part, those mapping upstream of the MS:MS-CN position, a duplex right part. Taking advantage of the identification of the rRNA­snoRNA duplex sets in a growing number of species we have analyzed the duplexes guiding methylation of the large sub-

Figure 1. Box C/D snoRNA structural features. The C and D boxes that lay at the 5 and 3 snoRNA ends, respectively, are brought together by a terminal helix of 4­5 bp forming a kink­turn structure and serve as a platform for the enzymes involved in RNA ribose chemical modification. Most box C/D snoRNAs also harbor a pair of C and D internal boxes. The distance between the C and D boxes is restricted to 3­9 nucleotides; an internal stem frequently brings them closer to each other. Boxes C, C, D, D and their consensus sequences are indicated (R is a purine nucleotide). Nucleotides destined for 2-Omethylation are signaled by black circles; they are invariably located five bases upstream of the D and D boxes. For convenience, the base-pair positions in the duplexes are numbered relative to the D and D boxes. The base-pair positions mapping between the D and D boxes and MS-CN positions defined a MS:MS-CN left side, those mapping upstream of the MS-CN, a MS:MS-CN right side.

773 G:U base-pairings on both sides of the MS:MS-CN position, from the 2nd to 11th positions, but 41 duplexes have one mismatch. In our analysis of the RNA duplex features and evolution, we defined the duplex starts as the first W:C or G:U base-pair upstream of the D box, and the duplex ends, as the first mismatch not followed by a minimum of two apposed W:C or G:U base-pairs. With this definition, 331 duplexes only involved W:C and G:U base-pairs, 74 displayed one mismatch, and nine, two mismatches. One duplex with four mismatches also fit the definition; no corresponding experimental data could be recovered. This duplex was considered separately. We first characterized the occurrence of the W:C base-pairs, G:U base-pairs and mismatched bases at the 1st to 20th positions (Figure 3). The 1st position displayed about 20% of G:U base-pairs, 30% of W:C base-pairs and 50% of mismatched bases. The 2nd and 3rd positions had about 90% and 98% of W:C base-pairs, respectively; G:U base-pairs and mismatched bases were rare. The 4th position only displayed W:C base-pairs but in three cases of G:U pairing. The MS:MS-CN 5th position only had W:C base-pairs. On the right side of the MS:MS-CN position, the 6th to 11th positions had > 90% of W:C base-pairs and few G:U base-pairs or mismatched bases. The 12th to 14th positions displayed gradually decreasing proportions of W:C base-pairs from 82% to 45%; the  15th positions exhibited proportions of W:C base-pairs, G:U base-pairs and mismatched bases that were similar to that of the 1st position. We then characterized the duplex lengths in function of the position of the duplex starts (Figure 4). The 204 duplexes that started at the 1st position ranged in size from 10 bp to 23 bp but mainly displayed lengths of 13 and 14 bp, ending at the 13th and 14th positions. Among the duplex unpaired at the 1st position, 195 started at the 2nd position and 15, at the 3rd position. Duplexes starting at the 2nd position ranged in size from 7 bp to 24 bp; they

unit (LSU) and small sub-unit (SSU) rRNAs of the animals H. sapiens and M. musculus, plants A. thaliana and O. sativa and yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (see Materials and Methods). A total of 415 RNA duplexes grouped into 124 methylation guiding sets, 179, into 31 sets that have been conserved throughout the radiation of the plants, fungi and animals, 118, into 34 sets that have been conserved between two of the kingdoms, and 118, within 59 sets that are kingdom-specific (Figure 2). snoRNAs and methylation sites had been experimentally identified in 334 and 274 cases, respectively; 28 duplexes were characterized by a computational approach. Most of the duplexes, 374 (> 90%), only displayed W:C and

Figure 4. Duplex end characterization. First W:C or G:U base-pairs upstream of the D box on the snoRNA strands define duplex starts, and single mismatches not followed by a minimum of two apposed W:C or G:U base-pairs, duplex ends. Fifteen, 195 and 205 duplexes started at the 3rd, 2nd and 1st positions, respectively. About 45% of the duplexes end at the D box upstream 13th and 14th positions.

mainly displayed a 12 bp length and ended at the 13th position; duplexes starting at the 3rd position ranged in size from 9 bp to 17 bp; they mainly displayed a 12 bp length and ended at the 14th position. When taking into account the duplexes only involving W:C and G:U base-pairs, the mean duplex lengths, and the main start and end positions, remained unchanged (data not shown). This was also true when only taking into account the duplexes from the 31 sets that were common to the three kingdoms and possibly displayed evolutionary optimized features, or the experimentally identified duplexes (data not shown). Altogether these data showed that the D box upstream 2nd position significantly limits the RNA duplex starts while the D box upstream 13th and 14th positions limit 45% of the RNA duplex ends. The D box-upstream 3rd to 11th positions show most severe evolutionary constraints Duplexes were aligned and compared within the 124 methylation sets and base differences were characterized. Duplex differences at duplex ends on the MS:MS-CN right side resulted from single base or base-pair mutations or from insertions/deletions (indels) events. Duplex differences at duplex starts on the MS:MS-CN left side, and within duplexes, at one of the positions participating to all duplexes from a duplex set, resulted from single base or basepair mutations in all cases but for two cases of 1 bp indel. Altogether the 407 single base and base-pair differences displayed a U-shaped distribution between the 1st and 19th positions, with lower values of 0% and 1.6% at the MS:MS-CN 5th and 4th positions, respectively, base-pair differences being counted as single events (Figure 5(a)). The 3rd and 6th to 10th positions had 5%­10% base differences, the 2nd and 11th positions, 17%­18%, respectively, the 1st position, 60%, and the  12th positions, 30%­90%. The 71 base-pairs differences and 336 single base differences displayed various ratios over the RNA duplex positions: 1:10­50 at the 1st, 2nd and  12th

positions, 1:2­4 at the 3rd to 11th positions (excluding the MS:MS-CN 5th position that did not display any difference). Single base differences displayed a U-shaped distribution between the 1st and 19th positions that was very similar to the one observed when taking into account all the base differences. This reflected the predominance of single base differences amongst duplex differences. In contrast, W:C base-pair changes displayed an inverted U-shaped distribution between the 1st and 19th positions, with higher values at the 8th to 13th positions. Base-pair differences at the 3rd to 11th positions only involved W:C changes but in 1 out of 27 cases (1 base-pair change at the 8th position was associated with mismatched bases). At the 1st, 2nd, 12th, 13th and 14th positions, base pair differences involved as many W:C changes than mismatched bases, with 13 and 15 cases, respectively. At the  15th positions, base-pair differences only associated with mismatched bases. Differences in W:C changes between the 3rd to 11th positions, and the 1st, 2nd, and  12th positions, appeared highly significant (P < 10 -6). The distributions of the single base and base-pair differences were also analyzed within the 31 RNA duplex sets that have been conserved throughout the plant, fungus and animal radiation, and 34 sets that have been conserved throughout the evolution of two of these kingdoms. In both cases did the single base differences display a U-shaped distribution between the 1st and 19th positions with lower values at the 4th and MS:MS-CN 5th positions, and the W:C changes, an inverted U-shaped distribution with higher values at the 8th to 13th positions. Differences in W:C changes between the 3rd to 11th positions, and the 1st, 2nd, and  12th positions, appeared significant for the RNA duplexes common to two of the three kingdoms (P < 10 -5) or to the three of them (P < 10 -3 ). Altogether these data showed that the 3rd to 11th positions define RNA duplex cores of 9 bp. Some regions from the rRNA molecules have long been known to display strong conservation throughout the plant, fungus and animal evolution,

Figure 5. Distribution of base differences within duplexes. Duplex differences involve single base and base-pair differences, part of which generated W:C changes. Base differences (circles), single base differences (triangles) and W:C changes (squares) were characterized from the 1st to 19th positions within the duplexes (a), and rRNA strands (b). Single base differences are scaled on the left ordinate axis, W:C base-pair changes, on the right ordinate axis. Note that the two ordinate axes have different and identical scales in (a) and (b), respectively. Frequencies of duplex differences were established within 80 sets for the 1st position, 121 sets for the 2nd position, 124 sets for the 3rd to 11th positions, 119 sets for the 12th position, 108 sets for the 13th position, 87 sets for the 14th position, 60 sets for the 15th position, 42 sets for the 16th position, 29 sets for the 17th position, 22 sets for the 18th position and 13 sets for the 19th position.

and others, variation.11,12 We looked for a possible interference of rRNA conservation on our identification of a RNA duplex core. The RNA duplexes were split into two categories according to the extent of their overlapping with the conserved regions. The RNA duplexes were considered mapping within conserved regions when at least five out of the nine core positions mapped within them, and outside of the conserved regions when less than five of the core positions mapped within them. Whatever the RNA duplexes mapped within or outside from the rRNA conserved regions, they exhibit a U-shaped distribution of single base mutations with lower frequencies at the 4th and MS:MS-CN 5th positions, and an inverted U-shaped distribution of W:C changes with higher frequencies at the 8th to 13th positions (data not shown). The identification of a core RNA duplex therefore did not depend on the proximity of RNA duplexes from conserved rRNA regions. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of rRNA­ snoRNA duplex differences demonstrated that most severe constraints have been exerted during the plant, fungus and animal radiation over the duplex cores defined by the D-box upstream 3rd to 11th positions.

Single base differences are counter-selected on both strands of the RNA duplexes The 331 single base differences were analyzed separately in the snoRNA and rRNA strands (basepair changes displayed, by definition, identical distributions on the rRNA­snoRNA duplexes, rRNA strands and snoRNA strands). The 309 single base differences mapping within the snoRNA sequences displayed a distribution between the 1st to 19th positions that was similar to the one observed when taking into account all the base differences, reflecting the predominance of snoRNA differences amongst single base differences (data not shown). The 27 single base differences that mapped within the rRNA sequences also displayed a U-shaped distribution between the 1st to 16th positions (Figure 5(b)). On both the rRNA and snoRNA strands did the 2nd position display single base differences with a frequency that was three times lower than the one characterizing the 1st position, with 3% and 18%, respectively. Single base differences at the 3rd to 11th positions appeared strongly counter-selected with frequencies of 0­1% on the rRNA strands and 0%­10% on the snoRNA strands.

776 Low values of single base differences characterized the rRNA and snoRNA strands at the 4th position. The 12th and following positions displayed a slight and progressive enhancement in single base difference frequencies on both strands. Single base and W:C base-pair mutations display different ages Mutational pathways could be identified for 146 of the single base differences and 37 of the W:C basepair differences at the 2nd to 13th positions over which we focused our evolutionary analysis, and the corresponding mutations, mapped on phylogenetic trees. The mutations that led to mispairing mostly appeared as relatively late events: 23 of the 33 that arose during plant evolution were posterior to the A. thaliana and O. sativa divergence, and 27 out of the 29 mutations that arose during yeast evolution were posterior to the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe divergence (Figure 6(a)). Out of the 34 mutations that led to base mispairing during animal evolution, 21 were posterior to the H. sapiens and M. musculus divergence. The mutations that led to G:U pairing at these positions also appeared as late events: 8 of the 14 sequence differences having arisen during plant evolution were posterior to the A. thaliana and O. sativa divergence and 16 of the 19 mutations shown by the fungus kingdom were posterior to the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe divergence (Figure 6(b)). Four of the 15 G:U base-pairs that arose during animal evolution were posterior to the H. sapiens and M. musculus divergence. Base-pair mutations leading to W:C changes, however, arose during eukaryote evolution with kinetics distinct from that of the single mutations: seven of the ten compensatory mutations displayed by the plants A. thaliana and O. sativa were anterior to their divergence and six of the ten mutations shown by the fungi

rRNA­snoRNA Duplex Evolution

S. cerevisiae and S. pombe occurred before their divergence (Figure 6(c)). Thirteen of 14 compensatory mutations were anterior to the H. sapiens and M. musculus divergence. Single mutations leading to mismatch assortment and G:U base-pairing appeared relatively recent; > 75% of them were posterior to the A. thaliana and O. sativa and S. cerevisiae and S. pombe divergences (less were posterior to the more recent H. sapiens and M. musculus divergence). In contrast more than 75% of the base-pair mutations leading to W:C changes arose after the divergence of these species. Half of the single base mutations in the RNA duplex cores promotes G:U pairing Single base mutational pathways were separately analyzed at the 3rd to 11th positions and 2nd, 12th and 13th positions, since they have evolved with very different constraints. Ciliate sequences were used as outgroup sequences when necessary. The single base mutational pathways exhibited four features. First, the AG and CT pathways that led to G:U base-pairs and the pathways leading to mismatched bases displayed different ratios between the 3rd to 11th positions and 2nd, 12th and 13th positions with ratios close to 1:1 for the former and to 1:3 for the latter (Figure 7(a); Table 1A). Second, almost all the single mutations resulted from a mutation in the snoRNA strands: 21 out of the 22 that led to a G:U base-pair and 21 of the 22 that led to mismatched bases at the 3rd to 11th positions, 24 of the 27 that led to G:U basepairs and 72 of the 75 that led to mismatched bases at the 2nd, 12th and 13th positions (Tables 1A and B, 2A and B). Only one mismatch assortment and 1 G:U base-pair resulted from a mutation in the rRNA strands at the 3rd to 11th positions. Third, the AG and CT mutations displayed a ratio

Figure 6. Mapping mutations on phylogenetic trees. Mutations leading to mismatched bases (a), G:U base-pairs (b) and W:C changes (c) were mapped relative to species or kingdom divergence. For example, the 18sUm1326 set groups six duplexes that all display a G:C base-pair at the 7th position but, the two yeast duplexes that display a G:U base-pair. The mutation accounting for this duplex difference must have arisen after the fungus and animal divergence, but before the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe speciation. The number of mutation events is given in each branch segment. Times of divergence are displayed on the right.

Figure 7. Duplex mutational pathways. Pathways of single mutations (a) and W:C changes (b) are shown for positions 3rd to 11th, and for positions 2nd, 12th and 13th.

close to 1:5 at all positions in the snoRNA strands. Fourth, there were 1 and 3 AG mutations in the rRNA strands at the 3rd to 11th positions and at the 2nd, 12th and 13th positions, respectively, but there was no CT mutation in either position on the rRNA strands. Single base mutations at the 3rd to 11th positions displayed a high frequency of mutations leading to G:U base-pairs that strongly underlined the severe constraints having been exerted over them during the plant, fungus and animal radiation. This was also true when only considering single base mutations in the 31 duplex sets that have been conserved throughout the animal, plant and yeast radiation (data not shown). Most of the G:U base-pairs arose from a CT mutation on the snoRNA strands. The one G:U base-pair that arose in rRNA strands resulted from an AG mutation. W:C changes in the RNA duplex cores mainly result from an initial AG mutation on the rRNA strands W:C changes at the 2nd to 13th positions fell into two classes according to their intermediate mutation state. The W:C changes UA/CG, AU/GC, GC/ AU and CG/UA (the first nucleotide refers to the rRNA sequence and the last nucleotide, to the snoRNA sequence) that could occur with an intermediate G:U base-pairing state, and those, AU/UA, AU/CG, GC/CG and UA/GC, that necessary resulted from an intermediate mismatch state. The double compensatory mutations AU/ UA, AU/CG, GC/CG and UA/GC were rare at the duplex 3rd to 11th positions, with 2,2,1 and 1 cases,

respectively, and at the 2nd, 12th and 13th duplex positions with 1,1,1 and no cases, respectively (Figure 7(b); Table 1B). W:C changes involving an intermediate G:U state could occur through the successive mutations AG and TC that defined the hereafter named AG compensatory pathway, or through the successive mutations CT and GA, that defined the CT compensatory pathway. The AG compensatory pathway occurred 16 times at the duplex 3rd to 11th positions and six times at the 2nd, 12th and 13th positions (Table 2C). First mutations at the 3rd to 11th positions could be mapped within the snoRNA and rRNA strands in 3 and 10 cases, respectively, but remained non-ascertained to any RNA strand in 3 cases (see the next paragraph). First mutations at the 2nd, 12th and 13th positions could be mapped within the snoRNA and rRNA strands in 2 and 1 cases, respectively. The CT compensatory pathway occurred five times at the 3rd to 11th duplex positions and once, at the 2nd, 12th and 13th duplex positions. First mutations always mapped within the rRNA strand. W:C changes at the 2nd to 13th positions mainly occurred through an intermediate G:U base-pairing state. The two AG and CT compensatory pathways showed strong differences with the former being about threefold more frequent than the latter. About 80% and 20% of the first mutations of these two compensatory pathways localized within the rRNA and snoRNA strands, respectively. The same conclusions were obtained when only considering W:C changes in the 31 duplex sets that have been conserved throughout the animal, plant and yeast radiation (data not shown).

Mutations could be identified for 46 of the single base differences and 27 of the W:C changes at the D-box upstream 3rd to 11th positions that define the RNA duplex cores. Mutations are listed according to the RNA duplex sets they mapped into. The positions of the mutations are indicated. a RNA duplex sets were named accordingly to the human rRNA coordinates. b The strand (rRNA or snoRNA) and genome (At, A. thaliana; Hs, H. sapiens; Mm, M. musculus; Os, O. sativa; Sc, S. cerevisiae; Sp, S. pombe; Y, yeast; M, metazoan animal; P, plant) in which the mutations arose are indicated. For W:C changes, the first nucleotides refer to the rRNA sequences, and the last nucleotides to the snoRNA sequences. Bases that are located within rRNA stems are underlined. c All the single base mutations arose on the snoRNA strands but the three ones indicated by this mark. d The 11th position of site 18sAm512 corresponds to the 6th position of site 18sCm517. The 8th and 11th positions of site 28sGm4328 correspond to the 6th and 9th positions of site 28sGm4330, respectively. e The 10th and 11th positions of site 28sUm2814 pair with the 10th and 9th positions of site 28sCm3810 in a rRNA stem, respectively.

Mutation impact on the rRNA secondary structure We looked whether single base and base-pair mutations at the 2nd to 13th positions modified the rRNA secondary structure. Most of the 146 single mutations mapped within the snoRNA sequences. Only eight arose within the rRNA sequences, with three, in the rRNA stems: an intramolecular mismatch changed into a G:U basepair, an intramolecular W:C base-pair into a G:U base-pair, and an intramolecular W:C base-pair into a new W:C base-pair. Out of the 37 rRNA­snoRNA compensatory mutations, 19 mapped within the rRNA stem. Six of these mutations affected the rRNA intramolecular pairing: One intramolecular W:C base-pair changed into a mismatch, two intramolecular W:C base-pairs changed into G:U base-pairs, and three intramolecular mismatched bases changed into W:C basepairs. An initial AG mutation mapped on the snoRNA and rRNA strands in two and three cases, respectively, and an initial CT mutation, on the rRNA strands. Thirteen of the rRNA­snoRNA compensatory mutations mapping within rRNA stems did not affect rRNA intramolecular pairings because additional mutations characterized the stem complementary sequences. A consequence of the menage a trois situation displayed by the snoRNA, methylation site-encompassing rRNA and complementary rRNA sequences, however, was that the first mutation event could only be ascertained for the AU/GC and CG/UA mutational events.

Mutations leading to base mispairing, G:U pairing, and W:C changes were analyzed separately for their mapping, at the 3rd to 11th positions within the RNA duplex cores, or at the 2nd; 12th and 13th positions, for the mutational pathway they arose from, and the snoRNA or rRNA strands on which they arose. Thirteen mutations could not be ascertained to a group, 1 out of the 97 single mutations leading to base mispairing, 4 out of the 49 single mutations leading to G:U pairing, and 8 of the 30 W:C changes.

first mutation of the UA/CG and GC/AU events could not be ascertained between the snoRNA gene and rRNA complementary sequence. The AU/GC mutational event arose seven times; there was no CG/UA event (Table 1B). Although one-half of the rRNA­snoRNA compensatory mutations mapped within rRNA stems, two-thirds of them should have no impact on the rRNA structure as a consequence of their association with a third mutation within the rRNA complementary sequences.

Discussion
Defining the rRNA­snoRNA duplexes Pairing of the rRNA and box C/D snoRNA molecules over short stretches is required for an accurate guiding of methylation at a few hundred of rRNA ribose residues in eukaryotes and in archeabacteria.13,14 In most eukaryotic genomes, the box C/D snoRNAs and rRNAs display complementary sequences over 9 to 21 nucleotides. The 415 rRNA­ snoRNA duplexes of the A. thaliana, H. sapiens, M. musculus, O. sativa, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe genomes that we analyzed range in size from 7 bp to 24 bp. The 7 bp duplex and 21 bp duplex only consist in W:C and G:U base-pairs; they were characterized experimentally by gene disruption and cDNA cloning, respectively. The five duplexes that are > 21 bp display at least one mismatch; three were characterized experimentally. The protist Euglena

gracilis provides an exception to this size distribution with a maximal length of 12 bases separating the C and D boxes in most snoRNAs.15 The C and D boxes lay at the 5 and 3 snoRNA ends, respectively. They are brought together by a terminal helix of 4­5 bp forming a kink­turn structure and serve as a platform for the enzymes involved in RNA ribose chemical modification.16,17 The relative positioning of the C and D boxes plays a critical role in defining the base to be methylated in the rRNA­snoRNA duplex: the pairing of the rRNA MS and D-box MS-CN 5th upstream nucleotide defines the so-called "N plus five" rule. The W:C base-pairs, G:U base-pairs and mismatched bases at the D-box upstream 1st position show a ratio that is close to the ratio that would characterize randomly assorted nucleotides. Duplex base assortment at this position displays sharp differences with the ones characterizing the three other positions of the MS: MS-CN left side that mainly display W:C and G:U base-pairs. Less than 4% of the rRNA-box C/D snoRNA duplexes from A. thaliana, H. sapiens, M. musculus, O. sativa, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe display mismatched bases at both the 1st and 2nd positions. Pairing between the rRNAs and box C/D snoRNAs at the D-box upstream 1st position therefore appears as a very weak determinant of the rRNA methylation process, and the D-box upstream 2nd position, as a significant position for the rRNA-box C/D snoRNA duplex starts. About 45% of the duplexes extend over 12 and 13 bp, pointing out the D-box upstream 13th and 14th positions as main duplex ends.

780 Mutations at the D box-upstream 3rd to 11th positions have been severely counter-selected Two reports analyzed the impact of RNA duplex length and mismatched bases on methylation efficiency. Shortening of a human-engineered GCrich duplex of 12 bp (three A:U and nine C:G) by 1 bp results in a 20­25% decrease of methylation, and by 3 bp, in a 80% decrease.18 The change of a W:C base-pair for mismatched bases in the 15 bp natural duplex G1570 (nine A:U and six C:G) lowers the ribose methylation by a factor of 100 while the 11 bp duplex resulting from the truncation of the terminal two A:U and two C:G base-pairs abolishes ribose methylation.19 Our study provides an evolutionary frame for the analysis of the effect of rRNA­snoRNA duplex mutations on rRNA guiding efficiency. The D boxupstream 1st and  15th duplex positions that display nucleotide assortments indicative of a low, if any, evolutionary pressure have > 10% and > 50% of single base mutations on the rRNA and snoRNA strands, respectively (see Figure 5(b)). Both strands exhibit three times less single base mutations at the 2nd position than at the 1st position, and even less at the 3rd to 11th positions. None of the 5th MS:MS-CN position display a single base, nor a double compensatory mutation, amongst the 124 RNA duplex sets although our screening of the databases would have allowed their recovery. Mutations might be recovered at the MS:MS-CN position if comparisons were to involve much more distant organisms than the ones we selected for this first genome-wide analysis. The strict conservation of the ancestral W:C base-pairs at this position, however, implies that the MS and MS-CN bases have been submitted to a strong evolutionary pressure for pairing throughout about the 1.6 billion years of fungus, plant and animal radiation. Mutations at the D box-upstream 3rd to 11th positions display three specific features arguing for them having been strongly counter-selected during the plant, animal and yeast radiation. First, > 80% of the mismatched bases that arose during the divergence of the plants and that of the yeast are posterior to the A. thaliana and O. sativa, and S. cerevisiae and S. pombe divergences, although the corresponding divergence times only represent about 20% of the plant or yeast divergence. The times of divergence between H. sapiens and M. musculus, A. thaliana and O. sativa, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe had been estimated to 75, 200 and 400 million years, respectively,20­22 between the metazoan and fungus kingdoms, and the plants and the metazoan/fungus kingdoms, to 1.5 and 1.6 billion years, respectively.23 Second, the ratio of the mutations leading to G:U base-pairs to those leading to mismatched bases is threefold enhanced at the 3rd to 11th positions compared to the 2nd and  12th positions. Third, although mutation frequencies can reach > 50% at the duplex ends and the fact that duplexes are 12 bp on average, we did not recover any duplex with

more than one mutation at the 3rd to 11th positions (in the case of the one duplex with four mismatches, three mapped farther than the > 11th position, at positions 15th, 18th and 22nd). This strikingly contrasts with our characterization of 27 base-pair mutations at these duplex positions. The recent crystal structures of the ribosome and other larger RNA molecules reveal that basepairings occur between nearly all base-pair types, non-canonical base-pairs being observed in the unpaired regions of the secondary structure models. Many A:G and A:A base-pairs flank the end of the helix. We could not identify any bias for noncanonical base-pairs within, or at the end of, the snoRNA­rRNA duplexes. In both places, were the frequencies of the non-canonical base-pairs amongst the mismatched bases those that were expected from the nucleotide compositions of the snoRNA and rRNA duplex strands (data not shown). The snoRNA and rRNA duplex strands evolve through different mutational pathways The rRNA and snoRNA strands display differences in their mutational pathways. The G:U pairing in rRNA­snoRNA duplexes can be achieved through AG and CT mutations and may lead to single base differences, or to double compensatory mutations if a second TC and GA mutations arises at the assorted base. In the six genomes we studied, G:U pairings mainly result from CT mutations on the snoRNA strands but only from AG mutations on the rRNA strands (Table 2B and C). The lack of CT mutations in the rRNA strands is probably a consequence of the fact that the rRNA genes are members of highly repeated sequence families organized in tandem repeat arrays of hundreds of members; these genes evolve through frequent conversion events that homogenize sequences and correct the heteroduplexes by favoring the C:G over the A :T pairings.24 Sequence homogeneization should also be responsible for the overall low frequency of single mutations on the rRNA strands. In addition, heteroduplex correction must account for the lack of conversion of single CT mutations on the snoRNA strands into double complementary mutations, since these would require GA mutations on the rRNA strands. No extensive gene homogeneization or heteroduplex correction are expected for most snoRNA genes, since they that are present in one or a very few copies within the genomes of the species we studied but for O. sativa (Table 3). snoRNA and rRNA evolution Mutagenic studies and experimental identification of one mismatch-harboring duplexes demonstrate that such duplexes can guide rRNA methylation. Duplexes with one mismatch between the D boxupstream 3rd and 11th positions and duplexes only harboring W:C and G:U base-pairs, however, display different length distributions: 26% of the

781 ancestor would have overlapped the contemporary snoRNA gene sets of the three kingdoms. Both evolutionary phenomena may co-exist. Protein interactions, and secondary and tertiary structure requirements, have long been known to constrain the evolution of the rRNA molecules. We show here that the evolution of the rRNA molecules is also constrained by inter-molecular interactions with snoRNA sequences. Mutations within the snoRNA-pairing sequences are severely counterselected over stretches of nine bases but retained when participating in W:C changes. One-third of the W:C changes mapped within rRNA stems; most of them had low impact on the rRNA structure as a consequence of their association with a third mutation within the rRNA complementary sequences. Since the rRNAs of eukaryotes contain 100 to 200 sites, the modification of which is guided by snoRNA­rRNA duplexes, these are about 1000­ 2000 nucleotides of each rRNA transcription unit which evolution appears constrained by their interaction with snoRNA sequences. The list of the post-transcriptional modifications that are guided by snoRNAs is continuously growing, now including the methylation of small nuclear RNAs,26 transfer RNAs27 as well as the alternative splicing of a mRNA.28 Recent research has shown that miRNAs are influencing the expression and evolution of most mammalian mRNAs.29 Around 98% of all transcriptional output in humans and mice is non-coding RNA. Complex biological phenomena like RNAi, co-suppression, transgene silence, genomic imprinting and methylation, RNA editing, position-effect variegation and transvection involve RNAs.30 Undoubtedly, molecular epistatic interactions need to be examined extensively for each of these cases.

duplexes only harboring W:C and G:U base-pairs end before the 12th position, 45%, at the 13th and 14th positions, and 29%, at the  15th position, while 4% of the duplexes harboring one mismatch end before the 12th position, 30%, at the 13th and 14th positions, and 66%, at the  15th position. Duplexes with two mismatches and the one duplex with four mismatches tend towards the same characteristic, all of them ending farther than the 17th position. Duplex mismatch and duplex length therefore appear as two strongly linked parameters of the rRNA guiding process. A mutation within a duplex, the length of which has evolved to an optimized minimal size, would lower methylation efficiency unless balanced by another mutation at its end that should promote its lengthening. In contrast, a mutation promoting a longer length of a duplex would make room for a second mutation promoting mismatched bases at one of the duplex positions. From the first methylation site catalogues build in S. cerevisiae and human, the observation arose that a fraction of the methylation sites have not been conserved throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. Differences in methylation sites between kingdoms, or species, may be accounted for by snoRNA gene gain events. snoRNAs have just been shown to define a new class of mobile genetic elements. 25 In the absence of any functional constraint, a condition allowed by the existence of a functional duplicata, the high level of single mutations in the snoRNA genes would allow snoRNA sequences to match, by chance, short rRNA sequences. New snoRNAs should not be optimized for pairing with an rRNA sequence, and new snoRNA­rRNA duplexes should harbor mismatched bases. Single base differences, however, display a U-shaped distribution within the sets of kingdom-specific duplexes (the 1st position has eight single base differences, each of the 2nd, 6th, 10th and 11th positions had one difference, and the  12th positions,  five differences). If the kingdom-specific snoRNAs arose from recent gene gain and mutation events, they nevertheless are old enough to attest evolutionary constraints on the sequences participating in the RNA duplex cores. This suggests that the pool of new snoRNA genes at a given time is very low. Alternatively, differences between kingdoms may be accounted for by snoRNA gene loss events. In that hypothesis, the snoRNA gene set of the plant, fungus and animal

Parts of the homologous sequences of box C/D snoRNA genes were identified using the BLAST program35 at NCBI. Methylation site and rRNA­snoRNA complementary sequence identification The 2-O-ribose methylated sites and the duplexes formed by the rRNA and snoRNA complementary sequences were defined using the Snoscan program,36 then corrected manually. Duplexes started at the first A:U, G:C or G:U base-pair upstream of the D box on the snoRNA strand, and ended at the first mismatch not followed by a minimum of two apposed W:C or G:U basepairs. Some snoRNAs are members of small multigene families in plants and animals (Table 3). In those cases their sequences can display indels of a few nucleotides or different lengths. Longer duplex sequences were selectively retained for our analysis. rRNA multiple alignment and mutation identification rRNA multiple alignments were carried out with the CLUSTAL W program37 and manually corrected by using secondary structure information.38,39 rRNA methylated sites were located on the rRNA multiple alignment automatically and those shared by at least two of the six species were identified. The rRNA­snoRNA duplexes were grouped into sets and named according to the rRNA methylated sites they are related to. The duplex differences that mapped at the duplex starts or within the duplex, at the positions participating to all duplexes from a set, resulted from point mutations but in two cases of 1 bp indel. Duplex differences at duplex ends resulted from point mutations and indels that could not always clearly be distinguished due to important variations of the RNA lengths separating the duplex ends from the C box. Ciliate rRNA sequences were used as outgroup sequences when necessary.
